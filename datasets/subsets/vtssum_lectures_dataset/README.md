## VT-SSum Lectures/Talks Dataset

VT-SSum is a public dataset released under the CC BY-NC-ND license. Since this license does not allow derivative works to be published directly, you first need to clone the original dataset locally with `git clone https://github.com/Dod-o/VT-SSum.git`.  
At this point, you can run the only numbered script file to extract and merge the transcripts.

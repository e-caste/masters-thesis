00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.775
(dramatic music)

00:00:04.064 --> 00:00:06.814
(static buzzing)

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.520
- Okay everyone, greetings.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.873
Happy, happy Thursday.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.840
This is really a day
when I would have loved

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.580
to take you outside.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.610
And I'm feeling more constrained
than usual by the camera,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.433
which is making me stay inside.

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:28.800
I try not to be constrained
by the camera at all

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.180
but there are a few things that I can't do

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.010
because of the camera
and one of them is like,

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.260
call out your names when I
know that you're my class

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.670
and you're not sitting here.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.960
Like which I would totally be doing

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.070
right now with some of you,

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.570
but I can't because then like,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.180
you know, 3 million people would email-

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.755
Oh, one of them just showed up. (laughing)

00:00:44.755 --> 00:00:46.080
(audience laughing)

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.913
Okay, good.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.273
Okay, here's what I wanna talk about.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.790
I wanna talk about time.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.780
So if we were outside, I
could do this with the trees,

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.180
and I could talk about how
the seasons are changing

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.500
and the years go by

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.660
and each year is a bit
different than the one before.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.030
And some things remind
us of previous years,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.160
like the leaves changing, right?

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.600
I could talk about time

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960
because the argument
that I want you to get

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.960
from this lecture is that
history doesn't actually end.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.390
And if we can get that down,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.000
a whole lot of the politics
of the 21st century

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.050
we'll see will make
more sense than it does.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.740
History doesn't actually end.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.260
Okay, why am I starting so grandly?

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.430
I'm starting so grandly because
I really think it's the case

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.720
that the decline in history

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.340
and the decline in the humanities

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.650
in the last 30 years
have a great deal to do

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.324
with the collapse of democracy

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:51.360
and the rise of other forms of politics.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.010
I really think it's the case that

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.230
the absence of bearings in the past

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.300
mean that people are easier to manipulate.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.850
Or at the very least, the
absence of bearings in the past

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.440
opens the way for myth-makers

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.450
who focus on the innocence of our group

00:02:08.608 --> 00:02:10.800
as the only thing which
matters from the past.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.800
I think also the idea that
history has come to an end

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.030
is a way of flattening or
stultifying the imagination.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.200
If history is over,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.930
then this is the one thing
that you just kinda get,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.450
and there's not any point
practicing your imagination

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.740
and trying to imagine how,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.180
trying to work with your own minds

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.240
to see how things might be different.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.430
There are, you know, you are-

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.840
Don't worry, I'm gonna talk about Ukraine

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.220
within like three minutes.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.330
You can set a timer if you want.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.780
But, you have already been
exposed to various kinds of ideas

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.540
about how history comes to an
end in your lifetime, right?

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.790
So one version of how
history comes to an end

00:02:46.116 --> 00:02:48.600
is nationalism, right?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.910
So everybody's sorted
out into their own place

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.100
and like we're all ethnically homogeneous,

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.735
and then history comes to an end, right?

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:57.060
That version of history coming to an end

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.670
is implied in any notion which says

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.870
the outsiders are the problem

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.760
and only if we had fewer
of them and it was just us,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.050
then everything would be fine, right?

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.120
History would come to an end.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.800
This hasn't really been
a class about nationalism

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.450
but if you think way
back to the beginning,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.700
there's implicit in the
idea of ethnic nationalism,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.190
is the idea, is the assumption that,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.200
well, once we finally have our own state

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.250
and it's just our people,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.690
then history comes to an end.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.800
All tensions will come to an
end, history will be over.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.450
Another version of
history coming to an end

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.860
is consumerism, right?

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.340
Fundamentally, it's all
just Homo economicus,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.630
there's just supply and demand.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.610
They're just desires
that can be fulfilled.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.840
The market will fulfill them.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.940
History is over, right?

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.960
We're all basically the same,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.100
it's just a matter of like getting rid

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.630
of the last few trade barriers.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.460
History is over.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.660
Marxism is also an idea
about the end of history.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.810
Marxism says that there is a way

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.120
that humans are supposed to be.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.370
We do have a kind of human nature.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.440
Human nature has been corrupted

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.810
by the wrong form of technology.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.950
It will be corrected by the
right form of technology.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.570
Human nature was corrupted

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.670
when private property entered the scene.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.470
We were alienated from ourselves.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.540
But once we build up industry,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.430
once we build up high technology,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.470
the working classes will
inherit all of that,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.600
and we'll be restored to our own nature

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.920
and everything will be fine.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.940
And yes, history will come to an end.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.580
Now, this is all,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.810
okay, maybe not in three minutes,

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.643
gimme three more minutes.

00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:26.760
I'm gonna get to Ukraine.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.850
This is all relevant to
this larger trajectory

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.920
that we're trying to
follow in the 20th century

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.610
of how Ukraine gets treated
in the Soviet Union.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.423
Because Leninism was a very
special form of Marxism.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.160
Marxism says there's a special
role for the working class

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.720
in bringing history to an end.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.790
Marxism says the working class,

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.730
because of its special place in history,

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.700
absorbs, as it were, the
suffering of everyone,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.070
it has a special position, positionality,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.690
which allows it to see, as it were,

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.450
objectively all the harm of capitalism.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.160
And when the working class takes over,

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.740
all that harm will disappear.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.320
Now, one of the problems in Marxism

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.170
is that you never know exactly

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.970
when you're supposed
to make the revolution.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.100
If the revolution is really about

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.140
the working class
becoming big and powerful,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.940
isn't it then just
gonna happen on its own?

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.310
If capitalism is gonna produce
more and more injustice,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.680
then maybe there'll be
more and more alienation

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.610
and more and more workers,

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.200
and the revolution will happen on its own.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.480
But surely the revolution is
not gonna happen on its own.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.090
There must be somebody who does something.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.200
And Lenin took the view that
somebody has to do something.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.020
And he took this view which
is called volunteerism.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.480
He took it to kind of
an interesting extreme

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.090
where Lenin argued that
actually what is needed

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.820
is a disciplined avant-garde party,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.670
basically political experts
working in the shadows,

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.990
who know what they're doing,

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.920
who understand reality
better than the workers.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.860
And that those people should
make a revolution happen

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.380
as soon as there's an opportunity.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.520
Wherever there's a weak point

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.930
in the world capitalist system,

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.540
we should push on it, make a revolution.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.560
So with Leninism, you
get this weird mixture

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.590
of determinism and volunteerism.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.240
If there weren't Lenin,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.250
like if Lenin had tripped
over the furniture

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.800
in one of those cafes in
Zurich and broken his neck,

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.920
or less demanding counterfactual,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.840
if Lenin had gotten off that train

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.690
which was going to Petrograd in 1917,

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.043
and like, you know,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.950
I don't know, got off the train.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.200
The train left without him, I don't know.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.250
But invent it yourself.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.220
But if Lenin is not on
the train to Petrograd,

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.180
it's like that one guy

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.220
is not on that one train at that one time,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.600
there is no Bolshevik Revolution

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.060
and the 20th century looks
an awful lot different.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.650
So in that sense, you can say he's right.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.810
Individuals certainly matter in history.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.780
But, so there's this extreme volunteerism,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.820
which is confirmed by experience, right?

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.110
Lenin knows that he is right,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.030
that without him and Trotsky and Stalin

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.647
and, you know, Kamenev and Zinoviev

00:06:55.647 --> 00:06:56.940
and a few other characters,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.220
there wouldn't have been that revolution.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.190
On the other hand, they believe that

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:04.470
all their volunteerism,
all this willfulness

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.030
is justified by their knowledge

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.910
that history has to go a certain way.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.670
That there has to be feudalism,
capitalism, socialism.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.300
And now that they've carried
out their willful act,

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.950
they have to balance that willful act

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.460
by pushing the Soviet Union
through these stages of history.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.310
Because there's only one
way that history can go.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.360
There's only one way that history can go.

00:07:26.535 --> 00:07:27.660
And the Soviet Union is behind,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.120
so we're just gonna have
to push it very quickly.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.160
The consequences of this view for Ukraine

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.470
are dramatic, right?

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:36.990
The whole idea that there
has to be collectivization,

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.090
that agriculture has to be collectivized

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.650
is a result of the idea

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.960
that there's only one
way that history can go.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.420
And collectivization
then is the precondition

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.490
for the famine and the death of around

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.573
4 million people in 1932 and in 1933.

00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:56.340
You see a similar issue

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.890
with the national question itself, right?

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.210
In the national question itself,

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.280
you have the same swinging back and forth

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.370
between determinism and volunteerism.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.050
Where on the one hand,

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.450
we are confident we know
what's gonna happen,

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:12.180
and therefore, because we're
confident in the 1920s,

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.860
we're gonna let the
Ukrainian writers write,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.630
we're gonna let the
Ukrainian artists paint,

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.610
we're gonna have affirmative
action for Ukrainians

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.440
to drive them into the bureaucracy

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.010
and as loyal administrators
into the Soviet system.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.270
We're confident that that's the way

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.500
history is going to work.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.240
We're confident that capitalism

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.770
is gonna produce nationalism anyway,

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.270
and so, therefore, we're
gonna do it ourselves.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.800
We will contain it and we'll channel it

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.180
and we'll sublimate it,

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.990
and it will sublimate into
loyalty to the Soviet system.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.300
But then in the 1930s,

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.710
they lose their confidence.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:43.410
And instead of being sure
that history is on their side,

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:45.930
Stalin shifts back into
this volunteerist mode.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.000
What's wrong with collectivization?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.230
What's wrong with collectivization

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.600
is that individuals are
doing the wrong thing.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.510
Polish spies, Ukrainian nationalists,

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:55.980
individual records,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.350
people who for whatever malicious reason

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.680
are trying to block by way
of their own volunteerism,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:05.220
the way that history
actually has to go, right?

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.550
So the swing from
determinism to volunteerism

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.500
also helps you to understand

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.940
how they're trying to understand

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.243
or how they're dealing
with the national question.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.480
As we get into the Second World War

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.190
with the national question,
we see a new turn.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.020
And the new turn is possible

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.420
because the existence of the Soviet Union

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.310
is itself in question.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.190
So during the Second World War,

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.170
Stalin and others take a much
more benign view of Ukraine.

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:38.040
Why did they do this?

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.460
Because the war is being fought
largely in and for Ukraine,

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.940
and they need Ukrainians to
stay loyal to the Soviet Union.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.010
The Germans, of course,
do them an enormous favor

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.800
by exercising more Terror
in a shorter period of time

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.030
than the Soviets did,

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.710
thereby turning most people

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.540
inside the Ukrainian Soviet Republic,

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.860
back towards the Soviet Union,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.580
at least in the sense that it
is less bad than the Germans.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.560
So during the Second World War,

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.730
there's a lot of nostalgia.

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.710
Ukraine is called a great nation.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.170
Bohdan Khmelnyts'kyi is characterized

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.360
as a hero of the Ukrainian past.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:11.580
The simple fact that a
Ukrainian is even mentioned

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.610
as a kind of hero is striking.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.300
Then as we've seen in the
immediate postwar period,

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.010
there's another turn

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.230
in which the way the
national question is handled

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:24.090
is not just by nostalgia, right?

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.890
Which is characteristic of nationalism.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.260
It's also handled by ethnic cleansing.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:32.640
It's handled by taking
right-wing nationalist solutions

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.790
and making them Soviet policy.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.900
And not just right-wing ones,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.980
perfectly mainstream ones

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.290
like the Ukrainian idea of
Sobornist

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.030
which means in a political context,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.020
it means Sobornist

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.420
means all of the territory of Ukraine

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.570
inside the boundaries of
a Ukrainian state, right?

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.810
A Soborna Ukraina
is a Ukraine that contains

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.030
all the territory that
should belong to it.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.370
That's what Stalin creates
by extending the boundaries

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.260
of Ukraine, Soviet Ukraine, to the west.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.150
But also there are these rather

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.770
extreme right-wing solutions,

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.510
which we talked about in the last lecture

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:05.250
as ethnic cleansing,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.550
where it's not just that lots of people

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.080
get deported to Siberia,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.250
that's traditional, right?

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.840
From it's been since the 1920s,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.080
people have been deported to Siberia.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.530
It's not just that a quarter
of a million Ukrainians

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.870
are deported to Siberia
right after the war.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.600
That's notable but it's
not what I'm talking about.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.130
What I'm talking about is something else,

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:31.130
which is the deportation of
Poles and Jews into Poland.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:35.580
Because the deportation of
Poles and the Jews into Poland

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.060
suggests that the system
no longer believes

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.740
it can assimilate everybody.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.330
So if you're deported to Siberia,

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.515
there's a very good chance
you're going to die.

00:11:44.515 --> 00:11:48.600
But there is also at least
the idea in principle

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.340
that your body is going to be redeemed

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.840
for the Soviet system, right?

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.460
You're gonna be a laborer
while you're there,

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.860
after 5 years or 7 or
15 or whatever it is,

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.380
you're going to come back and
you will have been reformed.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.640
There's at least that idea.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.470
But if you were expelled across the border

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.750
of the Soviet Union into another country,

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.250
the system's given up on you, right?

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.300
And that is an even less confident system,

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.280
an even less internationalist system,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.410
an even more nationally-minded system

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.850
than one had in the 1930s,

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.133
as we now get into the 1940s.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.330
This logic is extended in a way,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.370
and, again, now I'm
recapitulating, last time,

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.310
but this logic is extended
in a way under Zhdanov

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.383
and under this logic of the two camps,

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:36.330
where, you know, you can
see this subtle shift

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.370
in the second half of Soviet history,

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.380
away from economic dynamism

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:43.680
and towards a kind of
cultural conservatism, right?

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.800
Where the economic dynamism
of Stalin, of Stalinism,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.790
is actually over.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.380
But no one of course can say that, right?

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.060
You can't wake up in the
morning and say that.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.060
But the economic dynamism
has already happened.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.100
The economic dynamism happened,
the mines have been dug,

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.060
the factories have been built,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.410
the big cities have been built.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.240
The countryside has been collectivized.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.490
All those things have been done.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.170
And then there was this war.

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.740
And now we have to think of a
new way to justify the state.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.410
And the way to justify the
state after the Second World War

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.410
has a great deal to do with
suddenly Russian culture,

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.520
where the class war is defined.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.340
Zhdanov defines the
class war as Us and Them,

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.890
two camps, communists, capitalists,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.680
or as they would say, the
democracies and the capitalists,

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.330
communists and capitalists.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.210
But what is the Us in this?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.360
The Us in this, under Zhdanov's reasoning,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.170
is something like the purity
of Russian culture, right?

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.000
The purity of Russian culture.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.640
And Russian writers are now being purged

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.500
because they are quoting Charles Dickens,

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.990
or somehow they are too cosmopolitan,

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.660
to use the word of the day, right?

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.250
Cosmopolitan.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.510
And that word, and this is something

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.130
I wanted to mention
last time but failed to,

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.950
that word in the last
few years of Stalinism,

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:59.490
especially from 1948 to
early 1953 when he dies,

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.680
that word cosmopolitan is very often used

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.510
as a code for Jews.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.510
So the Stalinist reasoning takes
up a Nazi or fascist trope,

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.450
namely that, it is the
Jews who are responsible

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.220
for the permeability of culture.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:17.160
It's the Jews who open up
culture to being perverted

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.930
and influenced by outside forces.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.540
That is what they do.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.010
And this means that,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.370
especially after the foundation
of the state of Israel,

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.390
there's a turn in
Stalinism against the Jews.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.160
The last national action
which was being prepared

00:14:34.483 --> 00:14:38.670
as Stalin fell ill and died
was to be against the Jews.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.130
And one of you asked me, and
it's an important question,

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.290
what does all this mean for
the memory of the events

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.330
that we refer to the Holocaust
and the Soviet Union?

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.430
The events that we refer
to as the Holocaust

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:49.860
could not be referred,
could not be defined as such

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.693
in the Soviet Union.

00:14:50.693 --> 00:14:52.770
In fairness, it took decades for that term

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:55.530
to actually emerge as
important in the United States.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.630
I mean, deep into the 1980s,

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.280
the Holocaust in the "New York Times"

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.320
still meant nuclear holocaust, right?

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.940
It's only actually fairly recently,

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.040
basically in your
lifetimes plus a few years,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.540
in which Holocaust has the meaning

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:07.470
that it does to you today,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.200
that is, the attempt at
exterminating all the Jews.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.360
So that's just, you know,
just to keep perspective.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.090
But in the Soviet Union,
the notion was that

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.090
the Jews who were murdered
were peaceful Soviet citizens.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.520
And if you were a Jew and
tried to draw attention

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.860
to the fact that Jews
were murdered as Jews,

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.260
and many more of them were
murdered than other groups,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.240
then you were treated as someone

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.540
who was a nationalist
perhaps, or a cosmopolitan.

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:32.880
But in any event, you
were going to be punished.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.280
The very people who Stalin
sent to the United States

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.620
in 1943 to raise money,

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.480
Soviet Jewish activist writers,

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.340
he sent them here, Madison Square Garden,

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.420
they were in a fundraising campaign

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.760
all across the United States
precisely on the logic that

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.680
Jews are suffering under the Nazis.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.360
Let's raise money for the Soviet Union.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.710
Those people were then purged

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:50.850
and several of them were killed

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.860
on the logic that they
had stood out, (chuckling)

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.240
and that they had done something

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.710
they weren't supposed to do.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.703
Okay, so this brings me to
the first end of history that-

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:01.760
So I've already given
away the game, right?

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.820
So if I don't get to the end,

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.230
you know that history doesn't actually

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.820
ever come to an end, right?

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:08.220
So when I talk about
these ends of history,

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.870
I'm trying to give us some perspective

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.700
on things which were
presented as ends of history.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.170
So my first end of history is
the end of Ukrainian history.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:21.170
And what I have in mind is a
kind of dialectical solution

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.360
that Nikita Khrushchev is associated with.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.440
By dialectics,

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.940
so, I mean, for all of you,

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.620
you know, Anglo-Saxons out there

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.820
who are used to thinking
in a straight line,

00:16:31.822 --> 00:16:34.443
the dialectic is the
idea, you know, if at all,

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.870
the dialectic is the idea that

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:44.460
something can persist even
as it is transformed, right?

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:46.770
So that things don't just
move in a straight line,

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.730
but rather something can meet
its contrary and be overcome.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.720
And in being overcoming,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:53.430
it becomes a kind of higher reality,

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:55.620
which preserves elements
of what it was before,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:58.410
but which is nevertheless
qualitatively different.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.850
So, right.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.320
So you needed like a-

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.153
Okay.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.580
Drug joke cut right out of
the lecture, right there.

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:07.890
Never happened. There
was no drug joke at all.

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.680
Yeah so, it didn't happen. Never happened.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.700
I didn't make a drug joke.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.482
That was me not making a drug joke.

00:17:13.482 --> 00:17:15.570
(audience laughing)
Okay, so.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:17.700
Okay. You needed to
wake up an hour earlier.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.750
You need coffee.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.850
So the example of the dialectic,

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:22.200
which many people will
be roughly familiar with,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.540
would be the Marxist dialectic, right?

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:28.290
So the idea that

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:29.400
class conflict,

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.680
capitalism is both good and bad, okay?

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.060
It's both good and bad.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:36.090
It's good because it
builds up the structures

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.410
that you need for socialism,

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.290
but it's bad because it
makes the workers suffer.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:41.850
So if you say capitalism is bad,

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:44.490
that's not quite true because
in the seeds of that suffering

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:46.350
is the good of the revolution, right?

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.420
And the revolution is gonna maintain,

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.590
when the revolution happens,

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.590
it's gonna preserve
elements of capitalism,

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.000
but at a higher level, right?

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.473
Transformed. Okay.

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.330
So Khrushchev has a dialectical idea

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.400
about the Ukrainian nation,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.080
which I'm going to explain
to you in just a moment.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.493
But before I do that,

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:08.973
I have to say a word about church history.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:15.830
The incorporation of Volhynia and Galicia,

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.210
but especially Galicia,

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.386
poses a durable challenge
to Soviet Ukraine.

00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:23.280
Volhynia and Galicia are
these westerly districts

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.320
that had belonged to Poland,

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.210
whose citizens have been Polish citizens

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:29.340
in the '20s and '30s,

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:31.890
and who had been exposed
to many repressions

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:33.030
on the Polish side,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:34.230
but who had not been exposed

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:38.280
to Soviet Terror and Soviet famine.

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.280
In Galicia, there was still
a Greek Catholic Church.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.000
And the Greek Catholic Church,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.680
what the Greek Catholic Church is,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.650
you know, it's a quintessentially
Ukrainian institution.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.750
I was at a fundraiser for the Ukrainian

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.493
Catholic University on Sunday.

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:57.510
Ukrainian Catholic
Church is the institution

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:01.110
which was founded in 1596
by the Union of Brest,

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.120
which was known as the Uniate Church

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.190
for a couple hundred years after that.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.840
After the partitions of Poland,

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.820
the Habsburg took this
church under their wing

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.880
and they renamed it the
Greek Catholic Church.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.290
They educated the priests,

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.140
they treated the priests
as a kind of a conduit

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.650
for enlightenment in a larger population.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.140
So this Greek, and then
this Greek Catholic Church

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.230
especially under Metropolitan
Andrii Sheptyts'kyi,

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.510
became something like
a national institution

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.323
under the Habsburgs and
remain so under the Poles.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.050
Sheptyts'kyi by the way is,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.480
well, he's remembered for a
lot of very interesting things,

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.280
but one of the things
that he's remembered for

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.230
and that we ought to know
him for in this class

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:43.050
is that he probably rescued
more Jews during the Holocaust

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:45.180
than any non-diplomat.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.070
So there were diplomats
who rescued more people,

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.820
but Sheptyts'kyi rescued more
than a hundred Jewish children

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.450
in the St. George's complex in Lviv.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:56.640
He died in 1944.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.220
He died just as Soviet
power was returning.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.733
When the Soviets reenacts
what had been Western,

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.630
what had been Western Ukraine
is now Western Ukraine again,

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.130
what had been Poland,

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.720
they dissolved the Greek
Catholic Church in March of 1946

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.970
and they subordinate the
Greek Catholic Church

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:19.860
to the Russian Orthodox
Church based in Moscow.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.460
The Greek Catholic Church
continues to exist in hiding

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.890
as they save themselves in the catacombs.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.180
There continued to be sacraments,

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.290
there continued to be priests

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.320
until the end of the Soviet Union.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.510
Now a striking thing
about this little incident

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.680
which I just want you to note,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.620
is that when the Soviet Union dissolves

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.760
the Greek Catholic Church,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.653
they do it in March of 1946,

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.410
I'm not expecting any of you

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.910
to like do the math in your head

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.003
but that's the 350th anniversary
of the Union of Brest.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.540
No, it's not my joke.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.010
This is on purpose

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.770
because there's something
about these round numbers

00:20:55.770 --> 00:20:58.680
which is starting to draw the
Soviet imagination, right?

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.800
Something about these kind
of negative anniversaries.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:04.260
I say negative because when it was 1596

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.610
and the Union of Brest was made,

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.800
nobody said, "Hey, in 350 years

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.140
there'll be a Soviet Union
which is gonna undo this."

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:11.760
It's a negative anniversary
'cause it only makes sense

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:12.960
looking back, right?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.030
So in 1946, the logic was,

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:18.240
a mistake was made 350 years ago,

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.073
which we are now,

00:21:19.073 --> 00:21:19.906
yes, it's weird,

00:21:19.906 --> 00:21:21.270
which we are now going to correct.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.210
I just wanna note this kind
of secular thinking, right?

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:25.470
This treatment of the past,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.060
this non-historical treatment of the past

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.980
as a kind of source of anniversaries

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.463
where we confirm something
or where we undo something.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.250
This hasn't been a class on Marxism

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:38.010
but that is not a Marxist way
of looking at history, right?

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.680
That's not a Marxist way of
looking at history at all.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.290
It's a very conservative
way of looking at history.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.290
Okay, so this brings me
to what Khrushchev did,

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.910
which is very interesting.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.340
So Nikita Khrushchev

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:55.150
is the last leader of
the Soviet Union/Russia

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.313
who you could say really
knew something about Ukraine.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.700
We talked about this a few lectures ago,

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.873
this phenomenon of Russian
workers who went to the Donbas.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.990
Sorry, Russian peasants, Russian workers

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.060
working in the Donbas.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.250
That was Khrushchev's family.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.950
He was from, you know, as
soon as I say this, you know,

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.380
one of my TAs who shall remain
nameless, will google it,

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.230
but he was from a little place
I think called Kalinovka,

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:26.550
and his family went into
the Donbas and worked,

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.920
like a lot of Russian workers, right?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.577
Then in the party, he was in Ukraine,

00:22:31.577 --> 00:22:33.630
Soviet Ukraine, during the Terror.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.500
He was in Soviet Ukraine
during and after the war.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.980
His, ugh, I'm not sure
if concubine is the word

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.860
if you're a communist
but his longtime partner,

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.780
later his wife,

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.070
was a Ukrainian from
the far, far, far west,

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.700
from Vasylkiv, or Vasilkov,
which is now actually in Poland.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.770
So she was a Lemko.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.820
Lemkos being Ruthenian
speakers of a language

00:22:59.820 --> 00:23:01.980
which can be seen as a
dialect of Ukrainian.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.230
Although if you speak
Polish, it's strikingly easy

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.633
to understand Lemko dialect of Ukrainian.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.479
So she was a Lemko.

00:23:09.479 --> 00:23:12.090
There were the Lemkos,
the Boykos, the Hutsuls,

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.300
these are the Ruthenians
from the extreme west of,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.860
you know, what's now considered Ukraine.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.350
Also in Czechoslovakia, also in Poland.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:23.130
So she was a Lemko from
the far, far, far west

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:24.720
of what you'd think of
Ukrainian territory,

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.490
who moved to Odessa, became a communist.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.950
And then she was in the West
Ukrainian Communist Party,

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.960
inside Poland in the interwar period.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.060
So she was someone who
understood Ukrainian politics

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.400
from all the way from the west.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.980
So why am I telling you all
this detail about Khrushchev?

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.110
Oh, Khrushchev was also
involved in the suppression

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:43.170
of Ukrainian partisans after
the Second World War, right?

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.470
So Khrushchev knew that there
was a Ukrainian question.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.910
He knew there was a Ukraine,

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.290
he'd been deeply involved with it

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.200
in many angles for decades.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:53.100
So it's a little bit,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:56.310
it's a little bit like
after the First World War,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.200
when the Bolsheviks realized, okay,

00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.630
of course we have to deal
with Ukraine in some way

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:03.270
because we've just realized
Ukrainians can field an army

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.790
and, you know, they
lost, but they're real.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.410
After the Second World War,

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:08.850
and Khrushchev comes to power

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:10.860
after Stalin's death which is 1953,

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.230
he is someone who's been dealing
with the Ukrainian question

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.110
one way or another, on
and off his entire life.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.710
So he finds a solution to this question

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:24.480
of how Ukraine can both
exist and not exist.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.830
Here's the solution.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.380
It has to do with an anniversary, okay?

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.950
So imagine it's 1954

00:24:32.566 --> 00:24:34.466
and Khrushchev has just come to power.

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.350
1954-

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.870
See, it's like so handy that
you've taken this class,

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:41.220
like, it goes back centuries, right?

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.350
Because you're immediately thinking 1954,

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.090
that's the 300th anniversary

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.250
of the Treaty of Pereiaslav, right?

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.150
That's what you're thinking.

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:50.040
You're like, you guys were right on that.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.303
And so was Khrushchev.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.900
So the official interpretation

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.460
which is given of Ukrainian history,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.190
and this is clever and
it is very influential

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.470
and it has something to do with
the war that's going on now,

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.290
the official interpretation
which Khrushchev gives is,

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:08.130
yes, of course, Ukraine
exists, ancient history,

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.590
distinct nation, Cossacks, all of that.

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.590
But in 1654,

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.790
Ukrainians chose to forever
bind their own history

00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:19.860
with that of Russia, right?

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.700
So they existed in order not to exist,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.270
or they existed in order to
exist at a higher level, right?

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.640
Ukraine existed, but it flowed into Russia

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.740
and thereby exist at a higher level

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.660
as part of now the Soviet Union, right?

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.580
That's dialectical thinking.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.303
If you kind of stretch your
neck a little bit, it's easier.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.880
So this is kind of a brilliant solution

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.380
and it's connected with,

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.180
'cause it seems to solve
this ideological problem

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.230
the Soviet Union keeps having.

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.240
Ukraine is real, but then
like, we're afraid of it.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.260
What are we gonna do?

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:50.190
What's its future?

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:51.023
Its future.

00:25:51.023 --> 00:25:54.210
Its future was chosen in 1654,

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:56.580
exactly 300 years before.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.940
The way this was done

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.430
marks a couple of trends
in the communist world.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:03.390
The first I've already suggested,

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.670
which is this anniversary business, right?

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:06.930
The nostalgia,

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:10.290
the justifying things on the
basis of hundreds of years ago.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.240
The second is consumerism.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.930
So in 1954, to mark
this grand anniversary,

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.880
which they just, you know, invented.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.050
I mean, it's not that
anybody was celebrating

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.430
the 100th or the 200th, right?

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.280
Only the 300th (chuckling)
was somehow important.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.280
So they produced consumer
goods marked 300 years,

00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:30.466
200,

00:26:30.466 --> 00:26:31.963
200,000

00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:33.957
I think it's Yekelchyk

00:26:33.957 --> 00:26:35.250
who writes about this in your reading,

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.170
2 million packs of cigarettes

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:38.640
with 300 years written on them,

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.780
which is kind of mysterious.

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:41.010
It's like the opposite
of the health warning

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.063
you get now, right?

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.573
200 pairs of men's socks,

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.043
200,000 bras and nightgowns.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.500
And I just like leave
it to your imagination

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:55.711
what impression it makes when
a bra says 300 years on it.

00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:57.240
(audience laughing)

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.040
But I mean, in fairness,
this was the beginning

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.810
of consumerism in the Soviet Union.

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:04.050
Okay, the other thing
which happens in 1954,

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.940
and this is, again, very,

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.490
this is pregnant with
meaning for what comes next,

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.540
is that Khrushchev,

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.630
again, someone who understands
the Ukrainian question

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.910
and knows that, unlike a lot of,

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:16.380
you know, unlike Brezhnev
who's gonna come,

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.280
unlike other people,

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.290
he knows that it would make sense

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:22.770
to appear to be doing
something for Ukraine.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.700
Khrushchev has the idea
that the Crimean Peninsula

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.850
will be transferred from
the Russian Federation

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.400
to Ukrainian Republic, right?

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.080
When I say Russian Federation,
I mean the Russian-

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.490
The RSFSR,

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:37.770
I mean the Russian Soviet
Socialist Republic,

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.600
the Russian Republic of the Soviet Union.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.710
Trends because none of these

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:41.700
are independent states at the time.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.590
Of course, there's a Russian
Republic, Ukraine Republic.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:45.590
It's gonna be moved from
the Russian Republic

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:46.923
to the Ukrainian Republic.

00:27:48.197 --> 00:27:50.160
Why did that happen in reality?

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.210
Two reasons.

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.460
The first is practical.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.110
As you all know from reading the news,

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.870
Crimea is a peninsula, from
the point of view of Ukraine.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:58.980
It's connected by land.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.720
But it's an island, from
the point of view of Russia.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.840
There's no connection to
Ukraine from Russia by land.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.890
Hence the big bridge.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:07.410
And so if you're going to,

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.870
so in terms of just sheer administration,

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.080
the connection of water
and electricity, the grid,

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.450
work much better from Ukraine
obviously then from Russia.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.240
And so administratively,
it made a lot of sense.

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.479
The second reason why this
sort of thing was plausible

00:28:21.479 --> 00:28:23.640
is the ethnic cleansing
of the Crimean Tatars.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.310
Because up until 1944,

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:28.350
the reason why Crimea
had a special status,

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.910
it wasn't just in the Russian Federation,

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.460
it was an autonomous unit
of the Russian Federation,

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.010
because of the Crimean Tatars.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.530
Once the Crimean Tatars
were ethnically cleansed,

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:38.580
as they were,

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.800
that reason for that status disappears.

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.210
In fact, that status itself

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.410
becomes a bit of an embarrassment.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.000
Why was it an autonomous republic?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.950
Because, you know, they're
not even supposed to speak

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:49.620
about the Crimean Tatars
at this point, right?

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.080
All the Crimean Tatar, like the toponyms,

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:53.340
just like Catherine did,

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.370
the toponyms, the place
names, are now being renamed.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.630
Crimean Tatar war heroes are
being described as Dagestani.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.930
They're being given other
ethnicities in Soviet press,

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.970
just because the idea
of the Crimean Tatars

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.460
is supposed to go away,
it's supposed to disappear.

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.530
And so that's another
reason why the transfer

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:12.870
of Crimea could seem plausible.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.430
And it suggests a kind of,

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:18.030
look, it suggests two
interesting things at once.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:20.850
That Ukraine is getting something,

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:22.770
so Ukraine should be grateful.

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.020
Russia is giving something.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.630
But the idea that Russia
is giving something

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:30.480
suggests that it was
Russia's to give, right?

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.730
And here you find the
origin of this notion

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:34.710
that Crimea was always Russian.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.250
Because how could Russia
have given it to Ukraine

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.470
if it hadn't been Russia's to give?

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.690
But maybe in some pretty profound senses,

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:45.390
it wasn't Russia's to give, right?

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:47.010
Maybe in some fairly profound senses,

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:51.540
Crimea had a diverse
history, all of its own.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.020
Okay, so this moment in 1954
with the gift of Crimea,

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.970
the gift of Crimea from Russia to Ukraine,

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.650
you can see how that matters now.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:02.160
Because the idea that
Crimea was always Russian

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.540
is based upon two things,

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.400
the ethnic cleansing
of the Crimean Tatars,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.750
and then the idea that Russia

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.640
could give it to Ukraine, right?

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.380
That's the basis of that notion.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.673
Okay, so.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.850
But this from Khrushchev's point of view,

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.680
of course, this is a meant to be

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.660
a kind of pro Ukrainian gesture.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.850
And towards the end of
Khrushchev's period,

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.460
we actually do move into
a period of something like

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:26.190
national communism in
the Ukrainian Republic

00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:29.190
under a man called Petro Shelest.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.480
Shelest.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.636
I think I'll put his
name on there for you.

00:30:32.636 --> 00:30:33.469
Shelest.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:39.540
Shelest was a Ukrainian,
native of Ukraine.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:40.373
Unlike Khrushchev,

00:30:40.373 --> 00:30:43.020
he had nothing to do
with Stalinist crimes.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:47.880
He was perceived as protective
of Ukrainian culture,

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.730
or at least not as interfering
with Ukrainian culture.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.960
The 1960s saw a minor
renaissance of Ukrainian culture

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.330
led by young writers uncreatively known

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:58.593
as the Sixtiers group.

00:31:01.273 --> 00:31:03.090
One of the figures here who's
gonna appear in a couple

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:05.460
of different junctures in
your reading is Ivan Dziuba

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.327
who wrote an interesting text called

00:31:07.327 --> 00:31:09.360
"Internationalism or Russification?"

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.590
which raises the questions

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.850
which I've been talking about here

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:13.770
like, you know, for example,

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.740
well, it's about these tensions, right?

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.590
About how you handle Ukraine.

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.630
And is Moscow actually internationalist

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.793
or is Moscow actually Russifying?

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.000
Dziuba also in 1966,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.105
and this is in your reading,

00:31:29.105 --> 00:31:32.610
gives a little informal speech
at the site of Baby Yar.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:36.390
Baby Yar is the largest
single massacre site

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:39.003
in the Holocaust in
terms of mass shootings.

00:31:40.384 --> 00:31:45.360
In September of 1941, about
34,000 Jews were murdered

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.570
over the course of two days
over this ravine, Baby Yar,

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.920
at the edge of Kyiv.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.860
And Ukrainian Jews, survivors, other Jews,

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:54.570
had been gathering
informally at this site.

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:57.810
And in 1966, Dziuba gave this
speech, which was, you know,

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.100
which was a kind of breakthrough

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.290
in Ukrainian-Jewish relations.

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:04.260
And that was all part of this
moment of relative freedom

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.030
of Ukrainian culture.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.670
Okay, so Ukrainian history
came to an end, right?

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:11.130
You got it, 1654 Ukraine
merged into Russia.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.020
Its only purpose was to merge into Russia.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.090
You also get that that's not
really the end of history.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.210
All right, so the third end of history,

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.080
I've already suggested,

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.690
is the end of Crimean history, right?

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.770
The end of Crimean history,

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.563
which is implied in this transfer.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:31.530
You know, as you know in this class,

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.990
especially from that lecture
of a couple weeks ago,

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.300
actually a lot of the
oldest attested material

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.370
we have from this region is from Crimea

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:39.990
or from the southern coast.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:41.370
The oldest attested peoples,

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.470
not the oldest peoples but
the oldest attested peoples

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:44.790
who left behind a written trace

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.500
are in or around Crimea,

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.740
and they're the Greeks and the Jews.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.440
We know that the Golden
Horde and the Crimean Khanate

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:57.440
had a state in Crimea for about 600 years.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:02.540
And that that came to an
end in 1783 when New Russia,

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:06.270
when Russian Empire takes over
and New Russia is declared.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.490
At that time, the population of Crimea

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.250
was about 100% Crimean Tatar.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:16.250
By 1944, it was 0% Crimean Tatar, right?

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.650
After the deportation.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:22.200
And so, you know, as I mentioned before,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.640
this is a kind of end of history.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.530
Because it's not just that
the people are removed,

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.963
it is also that their
property is given away,

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.860
the names of sacred
sites, the names of towns,

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.323
the names of everything are changed.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:37.710
The Crimeans are not only deported,

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.670
this might seem obvious,

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.230
but they're not allowed to come back.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.420
And although Khrushchev generally

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.600
condemns Stalin's deportations of people,

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.670
he does not change the
rule that the Crimeans

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:50.310
are not allowed to come back.

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:53.760
And, of course, in this transfer of 1954,

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.340
this grand, you know, gesture
between Russia and Ukraine,

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.720
the Crimeans are totally absent.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.570
Nobody goes to Uzbekistan
and asks the Crimeans

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:04.410
what they think about any of this, right?

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:07.650
And so this is a kind
of end of history too,

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:08.820
the end of the history of Crimea

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.970
or the end of history
of the Crimean Tatars.

00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:16.530
And the notion that it was always Russia,

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:18.870
which, you know, has
its intellectual origins

00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:21.060
around this 1954 transfer,

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.510
it also is very appealing
to Soviet citizens

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:26.790
who come to settle in
the Crimean Peninsula.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.023
The Crimean Peninsula remains and becomes

00:34:29.023 --> 00:34:31.920
a even more important Soviet naval base.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.810
And so it has that demographic.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:37.680
It also becomes a place where
Soviet notables can retire

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.930
for the very simple reason that it's warm

00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:43.230
and most of the rest of Russia is not.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.830
And when you're a recent arrival
in a colonizing position,

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.920
the notion that a place has
always been yours (chuckling)

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.900
is very attractive, right?

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.733
Very attractive.

00:34:52.733 --> 00:34:53.940
See, look, you're getting
better at dialectics

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:54.990
all the time, right?

00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:58.020
So like, precisely because you're new,

00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:00.540
the idea that you've always
been there is very attractive.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.790
Because the thought that
you're just there colonizing,

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.500
literally taking someone else's property

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.730
after they've been ethnically cleansed

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:06.563
is not very appealing.

00:35:06.563 --> 00:35:08.880
So the idea that you were always there

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.790
is attractive precisely
because you weren't, right?

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:13.950
So that's the end of Crimean history.

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:18.150
Now the final end of
history that I wanna do,

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.980
actually there's two more,

00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:24.150
the next one is the end
of Soviet history, okay?

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.710
And the end of Soviet history,

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.350
we're gonna talk more about
this in a lecture to come,

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:33.120
but the end of Soviet history
has to do with Brezhnev,

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:36.690
Leonid Brezhnev who
supplants Khrushchev in 1964.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:41.580
He makes his debut on the
world stage really in 1968

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:44.910
when the Soviet Union and
its Warsaw Pact allies

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:48.810
invade Czechoslovakia to put to an end

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:52.980
a reform movement known
as the Prague Spring.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.660
In 1968, he inaugurates what's
called the Brezhnev Doctrine.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.120
The Brezhnev Doctrine is the idea,

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.250
and this has resonance today too,

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.580
that whenever a fellow socialist state

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.890
is threatened by counterrevolution,

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:09.690
the Soviet Union can arrive

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:11.730
with fraternal assistance, right?

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.320
So this metaphor of brothers

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.523
is a very interesting thing.

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.010
I mean, again, not to put
too fine a point on it,

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.250
but like being someone's brother

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.400
is not a very Marxist
idea, (chuckling) right?

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.960
At least not in this sense, right?

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.730
I mean, fraternite, okay,

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:30.600
that could be a revolutionary idea.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.460
But the idea that I'm your big brother

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.900
and then when something goes wrong,

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.790
I get to come in and pound you,

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.830
that is not an especially Marxist idea.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.560
And that's the idea of
brotherhood which is meant here.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.030
And it also raises interesting questions.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.730
Like, if you're my little brother,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.900
who are the parents?

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.190
Like, where's mom and dad?

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:49.650
Like, where are they
in all of this? Right?

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.010
So like, this move into the family,

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.640
like it's actually a very
conservative move, right?

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.900
It's kinda mysterious, right?

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:58.920
There are just these brothers

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.810
and there aren't new sisters
and there aren't parents,

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:01.643
but there are brothers.

00:37:01.643 --> 00:37:03.210
And the little brother's
always doing wrong

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.770
and the big brother's
always gonna come and help.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.480
That idea in 1968,

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.310
but even more importantly
than that in 1968

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.220
about the Brezhnev Doctrine is that

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.130
it's no longer really about ideology.

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.610
So Brezhnev doesn't care about Marxism.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.130
He cares about it much less
than we have in this lecture.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:22.020
You know, Brezhnev, doing
that thing about dialectics,

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.020
he also would have like raised
his, you know, eyebrows,

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.600
which is more of an effort
for him than for you guys.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.957
And, you know, would have said,

00:37:28.957 --> 00:37:30.000
"Oh, what are you talking about" right?

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.730
Brezhnev was not interested
in Marxist theory at all.

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.070
The Brezhnev Doctrine is
not really about Marxism,

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.360
it's about power.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.500
And the Brezhnev Doctrine defines what is,

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.000
as what should be, right?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.300
So, you just follow the
line, whatever it might be,

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:46.133
and that's it.

00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:48.360
We're not gonna justify
it theoretically anymore.

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.930
That's a big important
breakthrough in the 1970s

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:54.720
in the Soviet Union, and not only.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.870
Because what it suggests is that

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.000
we are no longer moving into a future

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.340
where these dialectics
are still doing their work

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.070
or into a future where
Stalinist industrialization

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:06.480
is still producing dynamism

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.160
and economic change and social mobility,

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.020
which it did, for a couple generations.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:10.853
But no longer.

00:38:10.853 --> 00:38:12.620
Social mobility is
basically halted, right?

00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:15.450
In the Soviet Union in the
1970s, if you're an engineer,

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.570
very likely your father
was an engineer, right?

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:20.880
If you went to university,
probably your parents did.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.320
In the early days of the Soviet Union,

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.970
it wasn't like that, right?

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:24.930
It wasn't like that.

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:27.210
The nice apartments in
Kyiv, with all due respect,

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:28.410
like in the late Communist period,

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.500
they were owned by families
that were elite families.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.640
Okay, owned is maybe the wrong word.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.350
But in the early period, that wasn't true.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.270
There was lots of dynamism
because of the economy,

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.370
but also because of Terror, right?

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:39.840
Also because of Terror.

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.750
One of the things, one of
the attractions of Terror,

00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:43.590
if you're young,

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.550
I don't mean to give you ideas,

00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:45.630
but one of the attractions of Terror

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:46.860
if you're young is that it-

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:49.410
Stop nodding in the front
row, it's troubling.

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.510
You're right like only a few feet from me.

00:38:53.039 --> 00:38:54.420
One of the attractions of
Terror if you're young,

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.580
is that it clears up space above, right?

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.250
So the Great Terror of '37,
'38, among other things,

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.500
cleared up a lot of room up above

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.210
for people to move
through the ranks quickly

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.590
and make careers.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:07.527
But both Khrushchev and Brezhnev,

00:39:07.527 --> 00:39:08.460
and this is one of the few things

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.140
that Brezhnev kept from Khrushchev,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.570
said we're no longer to have mass Terror,

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.120
at least that affects
other communists, right?

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:19.050
So that was another way that
social mobility was halted.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:23.010
So what Brezhnev is doing in the 1970s

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:24.870
is he is proclaiming something like

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:28.200
what he calls really existing socialism.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.720
And really existing
socialism, it's like that-

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.220
There's a Jack Nicholson movie

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.070
in which he says like, "This
is as good as it gets."

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.450
I've even forget the movie,

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:37.380
like maybe that was even the title,

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.460
but he is in a dentist's office

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:39.360
and he's like looking around.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.950
It's like there was an old
guy sitting next to him.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.170
He's like, "You know, this
is as good as it gets."

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:44.460
It's like that. Like, this is it.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.170
Like, this is it. There's nothing else.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.220
We told you there was gonna be communism,

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.550
there isn't gonna be communism.

00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.110
This is it, right?

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.270
Your little apartment, you
know, whatever, that's it.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.190
This is it. This is
real existing socialism.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:57.600
This is what we've got.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.900
And we're gonna defend it.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:01.260
And it's not gonna change.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.900
We'll keep it going, we'll
tinker with the economy,

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.070
but no major reforms,

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:06.870
certainly no theoretical discussion.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.193
This is it.

00:40:09.267 --> 00:40:13.620
And this has basic implications
for the Ukrainian issue

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:18.330
because, if everything is
just the way that it is,

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.697
all you gotta do is kind
of borrow from the West,

00:40:20.697 --> 00:40:22.770
and this is how the Soviet
Union gets itself into trouble.

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:23.940
Talk about it next time.

00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:25.350
But you borrow money from the West,

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.700
you borrow gadgets from the West,

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.440
you steal gadgets from the West,

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.620
you steal technology from
the West as best you can,

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:35.280
and you try to make the system,
as it is, function smoothly.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.360
How does it function smoothly?

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.040
Suddenly Technocracy is what matters.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.570
Not revolution, technocracy.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.430
We all have to speak the same language.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:43.770
What language is that gonna be? Russian.

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.770
And so here you have, you're
in this old imperial tension

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.690
where the center says,

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.340
I need you all to speak Russian.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.520
But it's not because I don't
like, you know, Bashkir.

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.040
It's not because I don't like
be Belarusian or Estonian.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.960
It's because it's efficient.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.400
Whereas you, from your point of view,

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.500
in Mongolia or the Baltics or whatever,

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.146
you say, actually I kinda
like my own language

00:41:04.146 --> 00:41:05.850
and I think it's plenty efficient.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.080
You know, I think it works very well.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.580
It's very efficient in my own life, right?

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.730
And so that tension, which is
built into all these projects

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.540
emerges in 1970s with
particular reference to Ukraine.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:19.690
So Shelest is replaced in 1972

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:23.310
by Brezhnev's man who's
called Shcherbytsky.

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:25.650
And the 1970s then become a decade

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:29.010
of a kind of administrative
Russification of Ukraine.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:30.780
No one says Ukraine doesn't exist,

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.000
no one says Ukraine high
culture doesn't exist,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
but Ukrainian language
disappears slowly from schools,

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:43.460
the Ukrainian textbooks are
printed in far lower print runs.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:46.560
It goes down to about 25%
by the end of the 1970s

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.810
of what it had been at the beginning.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.300
Russian becomes very much
the language of prestige.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.240
To take an example you
guys will understand,

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.860
everybody will understand this example.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.090
You theoretically-

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:58.710
Okay, I'm just gonna put it to you, right?

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.600
Theoretically, you could
take your university exams

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.250
like the equivalent of your SAT, whatever,

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.080
university entrance exams in Ukraine,

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.303
you could theoretically take them

00:42:05.303 --> 00:42:07.410
in both Ukrainian or Russian,

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:09.093
because we're tolerant, right?

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.240
But the difference is, if
you take them in Ukrainian,

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.413
you're not gonna pass.

00:42:14.889 --> 00:42:15.722
(audience member laughing)

00:42:15.722 --> 00:42:18.150
So what do you do, right?

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.340
I mean, what do you actually do, right?

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.110
So no one is saying Ukraine doesn't exist.

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:23.700
Look, here's the entrance exam, right?

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.560
Here, it's right there in front of you.

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.550
You wanna take it?

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:28.530
But if you want social advancement,

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:30.180
if you want to go to college,

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.800
you're gonna take it in Russian, right?

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.100
So that's the kind of dynamic
we're talking about here.

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:39.720
So I'm referring to this
as an end of history

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.330
because of this idea that
this is as good as it gets.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:46.050
That, you know, everything
is now just about the-

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:47.730
It's about the consumerism.

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:49.200
You know, we're gonna kind of imitate

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.640
the capitalist that way.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.140
We imitated them with the transformation,

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.660
now we're gonna imitate
them with consumerism.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.730
And with the nationalism.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.050
But this is where things get tricky.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.630
In the '70s and '80s all
over the Soviet Bloc,

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.723
regimes begin to resort to nationalism.

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.960
But how do you do that
in the Soviet Union?

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:09.480
The Soviet Union's a multinational state.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.300
The way that they do it is with nostalgia

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.910
about the Second World War,

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:17.850
which is referred to as
the Great Fatherland War.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.280
When Brezhnev takes away the future,

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.864
he substitutes in the past, right?

00:43:23.864 --> 00:43:24.697
He's actually very,

00:43:24.697 --> 00:43:26.790
I mean, he gets mocked a lot

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:29.280
but these are very intelligent
political techniques

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.020
which plenty of capitalists

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.450
in the 21st century have copied, right?

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:34.950
So you take away the future

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:36.510
and you slide in the past.

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:40.350
And the past is a view of
the Great Fatherland War

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.320
in which the Soviet Union
is the innocent victim,

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.380
and the Soviet peoples defend the world

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:48.090
from the horrors of fascism,

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:49.890
led, of course, by the Russians.

00:43:49.890 --> 00:43:51.150
So there's an ambiguity here.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.250
Is it a myth about all the Soviet Union,

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:56.100
or is it a myth about Russia?

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.560
And it's in this myth
that present-day leaders

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:03.153
like Lukashenko in Belarus or
Putin in Russia were raised.

00:44:04.658 --> 00:44:07.140
And it's another building
block in trying to understand

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.610
this war of 2022.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:12.090
Because the idea of the Second
World War in which, you know,

00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:14.760
Stalin's alliance with
Hitler is totally forgotten,

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.610
the Russians are totally
innocent and, you know,

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.650
won the war with nobody else's help,

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.780
you just have to simplify
that a few more steps

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.270
to get to the way Putin thinks
about the Second World War.

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:26.460
And also, it helps to explain,

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.070
you know, why he would think
that he could fight this war

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.020
the way that he has done.

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.550
You know, who is in fact-

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.100
The Mayor of Vienna, Karl Lueger,

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.840
who was an anti-Semite, he said,

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.190
you know, "Who is a Jew, I decide.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:40.410
I decide who is a Jew," right?

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:43.670
Putin's notion is like, "Who
is a fascist, I decide," right?

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.150
If it's anybody but me.

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.580
Because by definition the
fascist are the other side.

00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:50.010
And that's just a couple of
steps away from this view,

00:44:50.010 --> 00:44:51.810
the Soviet view of the Second World War.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:53.340
So it's an end of history

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.430
in which now you're
looking back to the past.

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.810
All right, where I wanna close

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.633
is just with a few minutes about Poland.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.763
In Poland,

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.360
and here's where you get
all these funny names

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.193
that are at the end,

00:45:07.193 --> 00:45:09.060
like all these names
of like Polish thinkers

00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:10.230
and Ukrainian thinkers.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.910
And the reason why they're here

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:14.463
is because in Poland,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.990
or rather from Polish thinkers,

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.140
you get a very interesting moment

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:24.960
of Polish Ukrainian conversation,

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.720
which is actually about how
history's not over. (chuckling)

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.940
It's about how something new is coming

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:31.500
and we have to be ready for it.

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:34.650
Which is so different
and fresh in its time,

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.620
that many people can't
deal with it, right?

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.990
Even from the point of view of the West,

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:41.550
in the '70s and '80s,

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.580
the idea that there was gonna
be anything but more of this

00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:47.610
was almost impossible to process, right?

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.950
By the '70s and '80s,
it really did seem like

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:50.850
Brezhnev was forever,

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:52.020
the Soviet Union was forever,

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.580
the Eastern Bloc was forever.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.610
Ukraine had been pretty much
completely forgotten about,

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.830
except by the emigre institutions,

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:00.150
the Canadians in Alberta,

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.960
the Harvard Ukrainian Research
Institute, the diaspora.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.280
But with the exception of that,

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:08.670
Ukraine was basically gone
from the Western imagination.

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:12.210
But there was a very interesting
project inside Poland

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:14.940
or among Poles which worked against this.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.860
And it operated against this
notion that history was over,

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.710
which was also true in Poland too.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:25.020
In Poland, there was
everything I talked about.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.030
There was, 1968 as a turning point,

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.160
shift to consumerism and nationalism.

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:32.100
In the 1970s, the Polish
state actually declares itself

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.170
to be ethnically homogeneous,

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.910
which is a way of saying
history is over, right?

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.740
All these national things,

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.540
it's all Poles now.

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.030
No Jews, no Russians, no Ukrainians,

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.740
no Belarussians, no Germans.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.530
It's just Poles and that's
the triumph of communism.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:47.490
It's a very interesting version

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.170
of the triumph of communism, right?

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.343
But history is over.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:52.650
There was a group of people

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.430
around a journal called "Paris Kultura."

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.700
And I need you guys to
know this name so much

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.470
that I'm going to give you
a hundred percent guarantee

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.367
that it's on the exam. (chuckling)

00:47:03.367 --> 00:47:05.437
"Paris Kultura."

00:47:05.437 --> 00:47:10.437
"Paris Kultura" was formed
by a group of Polish emigres.

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.462
Jerzy Giedroyc was the most important.

00:47:13.462 --> 00:47:14.940
Juliusz Mieroszewski also very important.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:16.410
Jozef Czapski.

00:47:16.410 --> 00:47:21.240
And what "Kultura" said was,
about the Ukrainian question,

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.800
very interesting things.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.617
But in 1952, they printed a
letter to the editor which said,

00:47:26.617 --> 00:47:29.910
"Let Lvov be Ukraine."

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:30.743
Actually, it said,

00:47:30.743 --> 00:47:33.180
"Let the blue and yellow
flag fly from Lvov."

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.800
Now if you're Ukrainian,
you're thinking like,

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:35.940
what's radical about that?

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.580
What's radical about that
is that Poland had just lost

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.280
half of its territory seven years ago

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.590
under conditions which could only be seen

00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.420
as completely illegitimate, right?

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:48.210
The Soviet Union had taken
half of Poland's territory

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:49.950
in a war in which Poland had lost

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.290
millions of its own population, right?

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:53.467
In those conditions, saying,

00:47:53.467 --> 00:47:55.500
"Oh yes, let's just like. Oh, fine."

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.750
You know, Poland only
had four major cities.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.250
Warsaw was destroyed,

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:00.810
Vilnius went to Lithuania,

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:02.487
Lviv went to Ukraine, right?

00:48:02.487 --> 00:48:04.050
And so you're saying, "Oh, legit."

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.947
It was like saying in 1952,

00:48:05.947 --> 00:48:07.710
"Let the Ukrainians have it,"

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:09.990
was incredibly radical.

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.630
And they went from there to the argument

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:14.160
in the '60s and '70s-

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.650
Again, the crucial thing about this, guys,

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:20.400
the crucial thing is they
were thinking ahead, right?

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.560
They didn't think history was over.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.940
They thought at some point

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:25.983
communism was gonna come to an end.

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:28.290
Even more essentially,

00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.290
they thought that imperialism
had to come to an end.

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.230
And they didn't just mean
Russian imperialism, right?

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:36.780
They meant imperialism as a whole,

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.480
which meant their own imperialism,

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.380
their own Polish imperialism
had to come to an end.

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.210
So their strategic argument

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:48.000
for the existence of Ukraine was,

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.220
we need Ukraine because without Ukraine,

00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.990
there will be Russian imperialism

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:54.930
and there will be Polish imperialism.

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:57.510
And both of those things are bad for us.

00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:59.040
Russian imperialism bad for us,

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.830
Polish imperialism also bad for us.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:04.590
So there was a calculated
strategic argument

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:06.420
which they made in the '60s and '70s,

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:08.340
totally in the wilderness.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.900
Totally in the wilderness.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.820
Other Polish immigrants
did not necessarily

00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.533
go along with this view, right?

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:17.070
In the West, the idea that
communism have come to an end,

00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.860
Ukraine, all this, pretty marginal.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:21.570
But along with this,

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:23.190
and all these names that I don't have time

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:24.420
to mention anymore, unfortunately,

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:25.770
but along with this,

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:29.880
what "Kultura" did was
seek out and publish

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.520
exceptionally talented Ukrainian writers

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:34.203
like George Shevelov,

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:37.623
like Borys Levyts'kyi.

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:40.230
They found the Ukrainian writers

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:43.860
and they befriended them
and they published them.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.680
The Ukrainian writers who
were executed in the '30s

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.030
or committed suicide,

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:51.570
the term Executed
Renaissance for those writers

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:52.963
comes from Jerzy Giedroyc.

00:49:52.963 --> 00:49:53.796
He made that term up.

00:49:53.796 --> 00:49:57.300
And he published a thousand-page book

00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.480
collecting the works of these
Ukrainian writers, right?

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:02.460
No one else did that,
but "Kultura" did that.

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.530
And in this and many other ways,

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:08.010
they pushed Ukrainian
culture towards the center

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.340
of at least of Polish culture
and they made friendships.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:13.540
I'm gonna finish now,
but you get the point.

00:50:15.337 --> 00:50:17.793
By the time of Solidarity
in Poland in 1980,

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.520
the "Kultura," which was regarded

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.620
as the best Polish publication,

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.540
had already started this argument.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:26.880
And so during the Solidarity
period in '80, '81

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.950
where there was some
space for free discussion,

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:31.320
the Ukrainian question
was already discussed.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.820
And many leaders of Solidarity,

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:36.090
such as Adam Michnik and Jacek
Kuroń issued statements

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:37.920
which were very friendly
to the idea of Ukrainian

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.230
independence during that period of '80-'81.

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:43.890
And then when Poland becomes
an independent state in 1989,

00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:46.200
this argument has already been won.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.540
And one of the first
things that Poland does

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:49.950
is that it begins a foreign policy

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.720
which is friendly to Ukraine.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.120
Now the reason why any
of this was possible

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.910
was because this milieu of intellectuals

00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:59.760
had been making this argument
that history was not over,

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.130
that communism was gonna come to an end,

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:04.500
that imperialism does
have to come to an end,

00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:07.230
and we have to be ready for
it with arguments, right?

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:10.890
So, my plaidoyer here at the end

00:51:10.890 --> 00:51:12.900
is one for the history of ideas.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.060
And I'll explain more about
this in lectures to come,

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.800
but the fact that some people recognized

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.507
that history couldn't come to an end,

00:51:18.507 --> 00:51:21.360
and that imperialism might come to an end,

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:23.340
actually had a great deal of influence

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:27.720
on how imperialism did
come to an end after 1989.

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:28.908
Okay, that's it.

00:51:28.908 --> 00:51:33.908
Thanks.

00:51:36.015 --> 00:51:38.682
(gentle music)

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.770
Prof: All the times will
be up on Friday so that you can

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:04.530
make your choices.
 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.953
We have eight different
sections that are set up,

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:09.780
and we're hoping that that's
sufficient for the class.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.789
There is also the obligation to
either take a midterm paper or

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:19.389
conduct a research effort that
would produce a paper,

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.970
roughly ten to twelve pages in
length.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.810
And I'll talk more about that.
 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.289
And as I lecture,
I'll often pause and suggest

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.596
what I think are interesting
research topics that will span a

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:33.958
whole array of different kinds
of laws and problems that we'll

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:34.620
cover.
 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.333
So that will be followed at the
end of the course by a final

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:45.949
examination that also I'll
provide a review session for.

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.258
And I wanted to make one thing
clear about this.

00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:53.210
I made an obligation to give a
lecture elsewhere about a year

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.840
ago that is up at Dartmouth next
Thursday.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.008
So we will not have class next
Thursday.

00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:01.741
But I will make that up by
providing you with a lecture at

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.055
the end of the course,
an additional lecture which

00:04:04.055 --> 00:04:06.450
will review all of the course
material for you prior to the

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.030
final exam.
 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.680
So let me start in.
 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.598
My interpretation of the
failures and successes of

00:04:14.598 --> 00:04:19.319
twentieth century environmental
law is very much tied to how

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.800
problems have been defined.
 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.132
And if you look back in
history, you'll see that

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:28.680
problems that have become
immediately apparent,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.278
have reached the press and a
wide public have often been

00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:33.720
translated into law.
 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.552
So if you think about the
Cuyahoga River,

00:04:36.552 --> 00:04:39.740
which used to catch fire
routinely in Ohio.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.684
It used to catch fire because
of the petroleum products that

00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:44.680
would lie on the surface of the
water.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.807
That prompted changes in the
Clean Water Act to try to reduce

00:04:49.807 --> 00:04:54.850
the emissions from industrial
facilities into the rivers.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.004
The Toxic Substance Control Act
evolved after concern about a

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:03.410
variety of events,
as well as the Resource

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.584
Conservation and Recovery Act
that applies to hazardous waste

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:11.411
sites following the discovery
that a canal that had been

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:15.725
loaded up with toxic substances
in New York State known as Love

00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:18.910
Canal,
had turned into a school site.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.141
The corporation had basically
abandoned the facility and it

00:05:22.141 --> 00:05:25.319
was turned over to the
community, which built a school.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.130
And gradually,
this seeping,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.822
oozing toxic soup started
bubbling to the surface of the

00:05:30.822 --> 00:05:33.976
playground and people's
backyards and into their

00:05:33.976 --> 00:05:35.050
basements.
 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.995
That prompted the passage of
the Superfund law back in the

00:05:40.995 --> 00:05:41.829
1980s.
 

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:45.709
So in many respects,
law follows public recognition

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:49.899
of significant threat that is a
surprise in a sense.

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:52.829
But these laws evolved not in a
systematic way.

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:56.470
It was not as if somebody said,
"Okay, we need air law.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.259
We need clean water law.
 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.860
We need toxic substance control
law.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.360
We have to worry about
hazardous sites.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.595
And what about all the federal
land management

00:06:04.595 --> 00:06:05.540
responsibilities?
 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.187
How are we going to manage
grazing lands,

00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:10.439
timberlands,
access to minerals?

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:12.629
How about private development?
 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.689
How are we going to manage new
development, new

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:15.629
subdivisions?"
 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:20.117
Rather than there being some
sort of a comprehensive vision

00:06:20.117 --> 00:06:23.600
about the nature of law that was
specific,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.653
saying, "Okay,
this kind of problem should be

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:28.250
dealt with best at the federal
level as opposed to another kind

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.430
of problem should be dealt with
by states."

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.149
And what about local
governments?

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:36.065
Which level of government has
the best capacity to deal with

00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:37.660
which kind of problem?
 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.060
No one sat down and thought
comprehensively about this.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.357
And the result is really what I
think of as a really fragmented

00:06:44.357 --> 00:06:48.447
patchwork quilt that's quite
frayed of various statutes that

00:06:48.447 --> 00:06:52.370
are pieced together,
that have embedded within them

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.603
different decision standards as
well as different levels of

00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:58.946
funding,
and administered by a variety

00:06:58.946 --> 00:07:00.110
of different agencies.
 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.790
So when I talk about
environmental law,

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.793
you probably know that the
Environmental Protection Agency

00:07:05.793 --> 00:07:08.851
has a primary responsibility to
administer some of the core

00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:10.994
statutes,
like the Clean Air Act and the

00:07:10.994 --> 00:07:11.790
Clean Water Act.
 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.187
But there are many other
statutes that deal with

00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:17.096
chemicals in the environment
that give authority to groups

00:07:17.096 --> 00:07:19.290
like the Food and Drug
Administration,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.410
the Consumer Product Safety
Commission,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.750
as examples.
 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.370
And often, responsibility for
one kind of a problem,

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.790
and we'll see this particularly
with respect to pesticides,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.687
is fractured among different
agencies with responsibility to

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:34.480
implement.
 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:37.668
So the Department of
Agriculture has a responsibility

00:07:37.668 --> 00:07:41.348
to consider the benefits and
cost to farmers of new pesticide

00:07:41.348 --> 00:07:42.329
regulations.
 

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:45.636
EPA has a responsibility to
look at toxicity data for

00:07:45.636 --> 00:07:49.069
pesticides and to judge what the
risk is and to set the

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:49.959
standards.
 

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:52.119
The Food and Drug
Administration has the

00:07:52.119 --> 00:07:55.108
responsibility to go out and
monitor what's in the food

00:07:55.108 --> 00:07:58.375
supply so we know whether or not
people are being exposed to

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:00.750
dangerous stuff,
chemical residues.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.490
So does this make sense?
 

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.240
It absolutely does not.
 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.000
And when we get to the
pesticide case,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.769
I'll tell you a story about how
I tried to pull data together

00:08:09.769 --> 00:08:13.350
from the Department of
Agriculture on what people eat,

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.226
pull data together from the
Food and Drug Administration

00:08:16.226 --> 00:08:18.790
about what residues they found
in those foods,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.466
pull data from the
Environmental Protection Agency

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:23.490
together in a way that made
sense,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.865
to try to figure out what you
or an individual might be

00:08:26.865 --> 00:08:29.430
exposed to and what your risk
might be.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.903
The databases were all set up
in different formats using

00:08:32.903 --> 00:08:34.230
different software.
 

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.169
It was a nightmare and it took
about three years to integrate

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.669
the datasets in order to answer
the simple question,

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:41.190
what are people exposed to?
 

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:45.297
So the patchwork quilt that's
frayed, that offers insufficient

00:08:45.297 --> 00:08:49.538
protection, is a key image that
I want you to carry with you.

00:08:49.538 --> 00:08:55.769
How we define problems often
will result in the effectiveness

00:08:55.769 --> 00:08:57.639
of the solution.
 

00:08:57.639 --> 00:09:00.806
And often the problems have
been highly reductionist in

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:01.918
their definition.
 

00:09:01.918 --> 00:09:06.379
And this has also been
associated with their assignment

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.278
to specific agencies.
 

00:09:08.278 --> 00:09:11.621
And we'll see that many of
these problems cross many

00:09:11.621 --> 00:09:13.129
different boundaries.
 

00:09:13.129 --> 00:09:16.692
And the absence of thinking in
a systems way,

00:09:16.692 --> 00:09:21.389
or thinking ecologically,
lies at the core of the issue.

00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:24.710
So what are the central
questions of environmental law?

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.831
One is the level of government
that's appropriate to the

00:09:27.831 --> 00:09:28.399
problem.
 

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:30.953
Clearly, if you have air
pollution blowing across state

00:09:30.953 --> 00:09:34.181
boundaries and local boundaries,
if everybody sets their own,

00:09:34.181 --> 00:09:36.820
every state sets their own air
pollution law,

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:40.441
that's going to be a nightmare
if each state has their own

00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:41.139
standard.
 

00:09:41.139 --> 00:09:44.928
Another key question would be
what branch of government should

00:09:44.928 --> 00:09:46.169
establish the law?
 

00:09:46.169 --> 00:09:48.980
So should it be the Congress?
 

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.769
Or should it be the Executive
Branch?

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:54.950
So EPA has the authority to set
regulations.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:59.019
So Congress passes a statute,
sets out broad guidelines,

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:01.916
and then the Environmental
Protection Agency has the

00:10:01.916 --> 00:10:05.323
authority to set regulations
that really are more refined and

00:10:05.323 --> 00:10:07.538
dependent upon scientific
evidence.

00:10:07.538 --> 00:10:11.256
So you really wouldn't want
Congress to get involved in the

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:14.782
setting of highly specific
regulations that really would

00:10:14.782 --> 00:10:18.178
demand an understanding of the
technical details.

00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:20.740
What's our capacity to detect
this chemical?

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.340
What's our capacity to
understand its risk?

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.899
Who's most at threat?
 

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:28.120
What are the costs and benefits
associated with regulation?

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.543
Do we really want Congress to
deal with that kind of

00:10:30.543 --> 00:10:31.210
specificity?
 

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.970
And I think often not.
 

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.184
Therefore, the Executive
Branch, meaning the

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:38.275
Environmental Protection Agency
or other regulatory agencies,

00:10:38.275 --> 00:10:40.080
are often given that authority.
 

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.001
When they're given that
authority and they don't do

00:10:43.001 --> 00:10:45.986
anything about it,
as has been the case for many

00:10:45.986 --> 00:10:49.053
of these problems,
Congress often will call them

00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:53.017
up and hold hearings and demand
them to explain why nothing has

00:10:53.017 --> 00:10:54.360
been accomplished.
 

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.048
And we'll talk about the Safe
Drinking Water Act as a great

00:10:57.048 --> 00:11:00.022
example of that,
where Congress finally threw up

00:11:00.022 --> 00:11:02.292
its hands and said,
"EPA, you're just not

00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:04.404
doing your job,
and we are going to specify

00:11:04.404 --> 00:11:07.918
which chemicals you have got to
test for in drinking water,

00:11:07.918 --> 00:11:11.019
and you have got to set maximum
contaminate levels for those

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:14.331
chemicals in drinking water,
and you've got to do it by date

00:11:14.331 --> 00:11:14.820
X."
 

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:18.190
They did that also with the
hazardous chemicals law.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.830
So Congress does get upset.
 

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:25.518
Regulations can be passed by
the President via executive

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.200
order.
 

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.811
And also the judiciary plays a
really critical role so that the

00:11:29.811 --> 00:11:32.780
collection of decisions
surrounding any one of these

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.808
problems creates precedent for
future decisions.

00:11:35.808 --> 00:11:39.495
And courts are often in a
position of interpreting

00:11:39.495 --> 00:11:44.006
uncertainty in the language of
statutes, but also uncertainty

00:11:44.006 --> 00:11:46.639
in the language of regulations.
 

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.538
And there are highly
individualized cases.

00:11:49.538 --> 00:11:53.788
And unfortunately the process
of adjudication in the court

00:11:53.788 --> 00:11:58.035
system is not very close to the
process of discovering new

00:11:58.035 --> 00:12:02.360
knowledge that we think about
here within the academy.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.398
It's not about discovering
truth, it's not about proving

00:12:06.398 --> 00:12:07.278
causality.
 

00:12:07.278 --> 00:12:10.120
It's about control of evidence
to tell a story.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.274
So the courts really are
looking at competing narratives

00:12:14.274 --> 00:12:17.607
of what the problem is,
what the damage is,

00:12:17.607 --> 00:12:21.424
and whether or not the
defendant really is responsible

00:12:21.424 --> 00:12:24.450
for adversely affecting the
plaintiffs.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.850
So another key question is
monitoring and surveillance.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.996
And it's very easy to pass a
law that sounds great on its

00:12:31.996 --> 00:12:34.024
face,
but if you look at it really

00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:35.967
carefully,
what you'll find is that

00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:39.123
there's really no comprehension
of how much monitoring and

00:12:39.123 --> 00:12:42.389
surveillance is required in
order to really do the job,

00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:43.620
to get the job done.
 

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.327
So monitoring and surveillance
I think of as one of the primary

00:12:47.327 --> 00:12:49.418
defects of twentieth-century
law.

00:12:49.418 --> 00:12:52.498
So we have grossly
misunderstood the amount of

00:12:52.498 --> 00:12:56.330
money that it will take to
really figure out what happens

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.820
when you release a chemical to
the environment.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.498
What happens if you blow it out
of your tailpipe on your car or

00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:09.027
it comes out of a nuclear power
plant, a radionuclide goes up

00:13:09.027 --> 00:13:10.309
into the air?
 

00:13:10.309 --> 00:13:11.490
What happens to that?
 

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.100
To figure that out is extremely
expensive.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.360
And in society with respect to
air pollution law,

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.562
chemical law,
even endangered species

00:13:18.562 --> 00:13:21.384
management,
understanding how many

00:13:21.384 --> 00:13:26.389
individuals of both sexes of
endangered mammals exist,

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:28.566
where they are,
what their reproductive rate

00:13:28.566 --> 00:13:30.678
is,
that takes intensive monitoring.

00:13:30.678 --> 00:13:34.452
So when these laws are passed,
if the government does not set

00:13:34.452 --> 00:13:37.533
up a really effective and
efficient monitoring and

00:13:37.533 --> 00:13:40.889
surveillance program,
the whole thing is just like a

00:13:40.889 --> 00:13:41.750
waste of time.
 

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.961
So the level of
misunderstanding of this issue,

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:50.700
I just cannot emphasize enough.
 

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.730
Another key question is access
to data.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.100
So who should have access to
data?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.860
And I'll give you a good
example of this.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.710
I'm working on a project now.
 

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.428
It happens to do with green
building standards.

00:14:02.428 --> 00:14:05.750
And I was wondering about
carpet treatments and the

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.336
Stainmaster Carpets as an
example, everybody's heard of

00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:10.399
Stainmaster.
 

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:14.375
Other chemicals are applied to
the surface of carpets to keep

00:14:14.375 --> 00:14:18.352
them from absorbing stains or to
keep things from sticking to

00:14:18.352 --> 00:14:18.950
them.
 

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:22.990
So you might think about
cookware as another example.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.671
A lot of cookware now you don't
have to put any sort of an oil

00:14:26.671 --> 00:14:29.928
into it in order to keep things
from sticking in it.

00:14:29.928 --> 00:14:33.552
So the chemicals that are used
to accomplish this,

00:14:33.552 --> 00:14:36.879
including to make your clothing
waterproof.

00:14:36.879 --> 00:14:39.779
For example,
I was skiing last week and I

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:42.389
looked down at myself and I
said,

00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:45.870
"Boy, I thought this was
just a nice waterproof shell

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:47.519
that I was wearing."
 

00:14:47.519 --> 00:14:49.600
And then I started thinking,
"Oh, you idiot.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.225
You're wearing a product and
you have no idea what the

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:54.730
ingredient is."
 

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.399
And I'm reading a report saying
that almost everybody has this

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:01.768
chemical in their body and it's
detectable in their human

00:15:01.768 --> 00:15:02.429
tissue.
 

00:15:02.429 --> 00:15:05.980
Now think about this history.
 

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.850
The chemical is released into
the marketplace.

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.570
It gets used in nonstick pans.
 

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.923
It gets used to be sprayed on
carpets to keep red wine from

00:15:13.923 --> 00:15:15.370
absorbing to the fiber.
 

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.961
It gets sprayed on surfaces
such as clothing to keep people

00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:22.740
dry so that the functionality
has been the primary concern.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:26.080
Nobody asks the question what
happens to this chemical?

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.899
Then down the road somebody
says, "Well,

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:31.870
let's test blood or let's test
urine or let's test body fat,

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.654
or maybe even hair to figure
out where this thing is going or

00:15:35.654 --> 00:15:37.798
whether or not it's there."
 

00:15:37.798 --> 00:15:40.649
And they find lo and behold,
that it is there.

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:44.345
And then to try to get the
chemical out of the marketplace,

00:15:44.345 --> 00:15:47.404
which is now global,
is a very difficult thing to

00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:48.360
accomplish.
 

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.538
So access to data.
 

00:15:50.538 --> 00:15:52.788
I'm reading in this report
about this data.

00:15:52.788 --> 00:15:57.288
One of the major corporations,
DuPont, has been producing

00:15:57.288 --> 00:16:00.019
chemicals that have this effect.
 

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:03.379
And they submitted a report to
EPA.

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:04.600
EPA put it up online.
 

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.740
And I've got to show it to you.
 

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.548
I haven't gotten it up in a PDF
format yet,

00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:13.240
but I've got to show it to you,
because every page has the

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.868
title of the topic and then it
has CBI written on it with

00:16:16.868 --> 00:16:17.970
nothing else.
 

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.975
CBI is the acronym for
confidential business

00:16:21.975 --> 00:16:23.278
information.
 

00:16:23.278 --> 00:16:26.238
So the information was
submitted from DuPont to the

00:16:26.238 --> 00:16:28.250
Environmental Protection Agency.
 

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.368
And the Environmental
Protection Agency basically

00:16:30.368 --> 00:16:32.840
shuts down the public from
understanding what that is.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.889
And it's all about how much of
the chemical is produced,

00:16:35.889 --> 00:16:38.610
what the company knows about
where it goes,

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:41.802
and also what the health
effects or environmental effects

00:16:41.802 --> 00:16:42.428
might be.
 

00:16:42.428 --> 00:16:46.120
So access to data,
intellectual property rights,

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.327
secrecy and confidentiality,
these are all things that we

00:16:49.327 --> 00:16:52.649
really need to think about very
carefully when we structure

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:53.908
environmental law.
 

00:16:53.908 --> 00:16:55.884
Another key question,
number five,

00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:57.798
is should we allow preemption?
 

00:16:57.798 --> 00:17:00.928
Preemption is a really
interesting idea that the

00:17:00.928 --> 00:17:04.457
federal government could prevent
a state from adopting

00:17:04.457 --> 00:17:08.051
regulations that might be
different or less restrictive

00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:10.250
than the federal standards.
 

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.798
And the Clean Air Act is a
great example of this.

00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:17.721
Because the Clean Air Act does
preempt states from adopting

00:17:17.721 --> 00:17:20.796
regulations that are different
from the federal standards with

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:23.518
respect to vehicle emissions,
power plant emissions,

00:17:23.518 --> 00:17:24.390
mercury emissions.
 

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.651
And the state of California,
however, was exempted by

00:17:27.651 --> 00:17:30.160
Congress when that statute was
passed.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.390
And why is that?
 

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.432
Well, it's because they have
some pretty severe air quality

00:17:33.432 --> 00:17:33.818
problems.
 

00:17:33.818 --> 00:17:36.655
There are different patches in
the country where air quality is

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:37.480
very, very poor.
 

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.848
And one is the L.A.
 

00:17:39.848 --> 00:17:42.279
basin, another is the Salt Lake
basin,

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:45.667
and Houston,
Atlanta, Chicago,

00:17:45.667 --> 00:17:48.138
New York,
this area is out of compliance

00:17:48.138 --> 00:17:49.779
with Clean Air Act standards
quite routinely.

00:17:49.779 --> 00:17:53.760
And you might think that this
geographic and climatological

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.880
variability is a pretty good
justification for states to have

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.970
the legal capacity to set their
own laws.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:05.693
Some states have far higher
pollution than the national

00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:06.568
average.
 

00:18:06.568 --> 00:18:10.890
So that thinking about what
kinds of problems are amenable

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.210
to having states have more
authority as opposed to when do

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.984
we want to centralize authority
across all states and locate the

00:18:19.984 --> 00:18:23.318
authority with the federal
government?

00:18:23.318 --> 00:18:25.009
This is a really important
question.

00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:27.969
Another key question is
administrative discretion versus

00:18:27.969 --> 00:18:29.098
statutory criteria.
 

00:18:29.098 --> 00:18:32.737
So when should Congress give
the Environmental Protection

00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:36.440
Agency the administrative
discretion to set standards,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.518
to judge whether or not the
economic benefits are

00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:42.788
outweighing what the
environmental harm might be?

00:18:42.788 --> 00:18:45.348
Should they have the authority
to do that?

00:18:45.348 --> 00:18:49.653
So if you adopt a utilitarian
standard that's cost-benefit

00:18:49.653 --> 00:18:52.900
balancing or say risk-benefit
balancing,

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.761
then you're basically giving
the agency a lot of discretion

00:18:55.761 --> 00:18:58.771
to do their technical analysis
and to try to figure out how to

00:18:58.771 --> 00:19:00.450
go through that balancing act.
 

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.118
That gives them a lot of
authority.

00:19:02.118 --> 00:19:05.269
As opposed to setting statutory
criteria,

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:08.585
saying, "The risk shall
not be greater than X,"

00:19:08.585 --> 00:19:10.227
say,
cancer risks should not be

00:19:10.227 --> 00:19:11.690
greater than one in a million.
 

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.846
Or the decision standard within
the Food Quality Protection Act

00:19:16.846 --> 00:19:21.422
that the agency must find a
reasonable certainty that no

00:19:21.422 --> 00:19:24.750
harm will result from any
pesticide.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.769
Sounds unfortunate.
 

00:19:29.769 --> 00:19:34.509
So thinking about whether or
not it makes sense to give an

00:19:34.509 --> 00:19:40.000
administrative agency that kind
of discretion is very important.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.548
And it depends again on the
technical nature of the problem.

00:19:42.548 --> 00:19:45.750
Another key question is risk
averaging.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.183
If you have lousy data,
data that is collected maybe

00:19:50.183 --> 00:19:55.488
with very small sample sizes so
that you have no understanding

00:19:55.488 --> 00:20:00.357
of demographic variability and
exposure or in the complex

00:20:00.357 --> 00:20:04.356
temporal and spatial
distributional patterns of

00:20:04.356 --> 00:20:07.880
pollution,
then it's like looking at the

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.750
world without my glasses on.
 

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:15.968
Which is, all the students look
the same so that you lose any

00:20:15.968 --> 00:20:19.307
resolution,
you lose the ability to

00:20:19.307 --> 00:20:23.903
identify pockets of serious
problems or high risk or high

00:20:23.903 --> 00:20:24.890
exposure.
 

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.789
And if you don't have that
resolution in your data,

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:30.517
you can't go in and protect the
most vulnerable,

00:20:30.517 --> 00:20:32.779
those people that are most at
risk.

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:38.348
So if EPA does not have good
monitoring and surveillance

00:20:38.348 --> 00:20:40.883
data,
they get to a position

00:20:40.883 --> 00:20:45.347
statistically where they're
forced to average very broadly

00:20:45.347 --> 00:20:47.430
across space,
across time,

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.368
and across demographic groups.
 

00:20:49.368 --> 00:20:51.858
And this is a very serious
problem.

00:20:51.858 --> 00:20:55.358
Getting our system of
environmental law to have the

00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:59.000
scientific and evidentiary
foundation that allows the

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.269
analyst to discriminate between
what's a really clean area and

00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:05.578
what's a really dirty area.
 

00:21:05.578 --> 00:21:08.971
And I'll give you one example
of that that we'll look at later

00:21:08.971 --> 00:21:11.640
in the term with respect to
vehicle emissions.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.439
I wondered about this,
because EPA sets their air

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.480
quality monitoring out in
fields.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.653
There's one just across the
Q-Bridge on Interstate 95,

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:21.328
right next to the highway.
 

00:21:21.328 --> 00:21:23.587
When you go across,
you get to the other side of

00:21:23.587 --> 00:21:26.423
the bridge, if you're heading
east on 95, you can see it set

00:21:26.423 --> 00:21:27.769
up on a little platform.
 

00:21:27.769 --> 00:21:30.910
So that's a fixed monitoring
site where they're measuring

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.490
particulate matter,
they're measuring ozone.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.325
Occasionally,
very occasionally,

00:21:35.325 --> 00:21:36.509
they measure VOCs.
 

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:41.047
So that their image of the
distribution of air pollution in

00:21:41.047 --> 00:21:45.348
the nation comes from this
network of fixed stations.

00:21:45.348 --> 00:21:47.818
And they've got probably two
dozen set up in Connecticut.

00:21:47.818 --> 00:21:50.788
I wondered whether or not you
would come to a very different

00:21:50.788 --> 00:21:53.505
conclusion about the quality of
air and the movement of

00:21:53.505 --> 00:21:55.980
pollution,
particularly vehicle emissions

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.308
and the carbon particles I was
talking about on Tuesday,

00:21:59.308 --> 00:22:03.778
if instead of reading your data
coming from the stations,

00:22:03.778 --> 00:22:07.200
you put the monitors on kids
and you followed them through

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.338
their daily life.
 

00:22:08.338 --> 00:22:11.804
And the answer is,
of course it's different,

00:22:11.804 --> 00:22:13.980
it's radically different.
 

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.328
And I'll demonstrate in a few
weeks why that is.

00:22:17.328 --> 00:22:22.111
So EPA has this image of
pollution being quite uniform

00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:25.450
across a state or across a
region,

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.847
whereas the pollution that you
inhale on a daily basis coming

00:22:29.847 --> 00:22:34.538
from secondhand cigarette smoke
or firsthand cigarette smoke,

00:22:34.538 --> 00:22:37.686
coming from vehicle emissions,
coming from power plant

00:22:37.686 --> 00:22:40.328
emissions,
power plants in Ohio.

00:22:40.328 --> 00:22:43.821
Generally it takes about two
weeks for particles released to

00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:47.194
the air in Europe if they're
very fine to make it into the

00:22:47.194 --> 00:22:50.688
stratosphere and to go all the
way around the world and then

00:22:50.688 --> 00:22:53.470
come back and become part of our
climate.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.950
So that it's very interesting
that your image of what's worth

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:02.131
worrying about is very dependent
upon this monitoring and

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:04.818
sampling and how specific it is.
 

00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:07.762
Number eight is really
critical, the burden of proof

00:23:07.762 --> 00:23:09.380
and the standard of proof.
 

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.621
Who should bear the burden of
proof that a problem is really

00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:15.509
serious?
 

00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:18.478
Well, industry often claims
that it's the public's

00:23:18.478 --> 00:23:21.750
responsibility to demonstrate
that their emissions,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.952
their chemicals,
their harvesting of a national

00:23:24.952 --> 00:23:28.269
forest,
that that is creating a problem.

00:23:28.269 --> 00:23:32.743
So if this burden lies on an
impoverished community or it

00:23:32.743 --> 00:23:37.140
lies on a group of families in a
small neighborhood,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.984
they're not going to be able to
mount the scientific analysis

00:23:41.984 --> 00:23:46.912
and develop the funding to mount
a legal campaign to challenge

00:23:46.912 --> 00:23:48.769
industry standards.
 

00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:52.740
Most large corporations have
groups of lawyers.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:57.803
They have large offices of
lawyers, or they hire law firms

00:23:57.803 --> 00:23:59.578
to represent them.
 

00:23:59.578 --> 00:24:01.702
I've been involved in
litigation for the past two

00:24:01.702 --> 00:24:04.241
decades,
and have sat across the table

00:24:04.241 --> 00:24:08.417
from six lawyers from a major
chemical company being deposed

00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:10.400
on a number of occasions.
 

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.818
And this was just a very small
group of lawyers that were

00:24:14.818 --> 00:24:19.634
trying to pick apart my claim
that a chemical posed a specific

00:24:19.634 --> 00:24:21.450
threat to children.
 

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:26.175
So most plaintiffs would not
have the capacity to mount that

00:24:26.175 --> 00:24:28.259
kind of legal expertise.
 

00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:33.410
And don't forget this basic
idea that probably ninety

00:24:33.410 --> 00:24:36.585
percent,
even ninety-five percent of

00:24:36.585 --> 00:24:40.355
environmental science,
of health science relative to

00:24:40.355 --> 00:24:44.798
environmental quality,
what sector does that go on in?

00:24:44.798 --> 00:24:46.798
It doesn't go on in the public
sector;

00:24:46.798 --> 00:24:48.440
it goes on in the private
sector.

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:53.069
So that corporations that are
very interested in making a

00:24:53.069 --> 00:24:56.460
profit and selling goods and
services,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.382
they basically are doing their
own internal risk assessments

00:25:00.382 --> 00:25:04.769
for what the effect might be on
the environment or human health.

00:25:04.769 --> 00:25:08.140
And those can never see the
light of day.

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.442
I'll talk on the pesticide case
in a few weeks about one

00:25:11.442 --> 00:25:14.146
compound, it's an
organophosphate insecticide,

00:25:14.146 --> 00:25:16.608
one of the world's most heavily
used.

00:25:16.608 --> 00:25:21.213
And Bio-Litigation,
the group I work with,

00:25:21.213 --> 00:25:27.055
forced disclosure of a database
that was really quite

00:25:27.055 --> 00:25:28.740
remarkable.
 

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:32.964
This company had spent $100
million on studies for one

00:25:32.964 --> 00:25:37.029
chemical to keep it in the
marketplace so they could

00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:40.140
understand what its risks might
be.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:43.230
Now, that's quite impressive.
 

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.210
So think about challenging the
quality of that evidence.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:51.253
Another company submitted a
proposal to the Environmental

00:25:51.253 --> 00:25:54.938
Protection Agency to continue
their license to use a

00:25:54.938 --> 00:25:55.950
pesticide.
 

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.548
This happened to be an
herbicide known as atrazine.

00:25:59.548 --> 00:26:02.393
Atrazine is found in the wells
of about thirty million people

00:26:02.393 --> 00:26:05.714
in the Midwest right now,
because it's sprayed across the

00:26:05.714 --> 00:26:08.420
landscape planted with corn and
soybeans.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.739
It's an endocrine disruptor,
in other words it's hormonally

00:26:12.739 --> 00:26:13.410
active.
 

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.387
And also it's believed to pose
different kinds of threats to

00:26:17.387 --> 00:26:18.400
human health.
 

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.115
So when this corporation
decided that it wanted to submit

00:26:22.115 --> 00:26:25.500
its data to the Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.859
they decided to do it not
electronically,

00:26:28.859 --> 00:26:30.509
but to deliver the material.
 

00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:33.326
And to deliver the material,
it took them two

00:26:33.326 --> 00:26:36.910
tractor-trailer loads of boxes
with the data sets and the

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.005
supporting evidence,
which they drove up to the

00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:43.400
docks of the Environmental
Protection Agency and unloaded.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.948
So you can imagine this
regulatory office of EPA looking

00:26:46.948 --> 00:26:50.818
at this huge sea of boxes that
they would have to analyze.

00:26:50.818 --> 00:26:52.700
That's a very interesting
strategy.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.558
So what would that do?
 

00:26:54.558 --> 00:26:57.778
Well, it basically would put a
regulatory effort that might be

00:26:57.778 --> 00:27:01.154
chugging down the road at a good
pace, and it would put it in the

00:27:01.154 --> 00:27:02.000
deep freeze.
 

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.781
It would slow it down to the
point where, oh my gosh,

00:27:04.781 --> 00:27:07.190
this agency has to look at
1,000 chemicals.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:09.834
This is one chemical and we've
got to go through all those

00:27:09.834 --> 00:27:12.616
datasets and we're going to have
to understand whether or not

00:27:12.616 --> 00:27:14.519
that evidence really is
supportable,

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:15.980
credible, replicable.
 

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.990
Oh, that's going to slow things
down.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.108
One out of 1,000 chemicals.
 

00:27:20.108 --> 00:27:23.594
So the burden of proof,
the standard of proof,

00:27:23.594 --> 00:27:25.838
is a really critical issue.
 

00:27:25.838 --> 00:27:30.428
So for civil actions,
you need to remember that the

00:27:30.428 --> 00:27:36.027
plaintiff needs to demonstrate
that damage occurred not beyond

00:27:36.027 --> 00:27:39.383
a reasonable doubt,
but by the standard of

00:27:39.383 --> 00:27:41.009
preponderance of the evidence.
 

00:27:41.009 --> 00:27:43.686
In other words,
it's more likely than not that

00:27:43.686 --> 00:27:45.710
the defendant caused the damage.
 

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:48.334
Think about that with respect
to the standard of proof

00:27:48.334 --> 00:27:50.958
required if you wanted to submit
a paper to Science

00:27:50.958 --> 00:27:51.798
Magazine.
 

00:27:51.798 --> 00:27:54.917
Well, you'd be asked questions
about what's your confidence

00:27:54.917 --> 00:27:55.509
interval?
 

00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:59.954
Do you have ninety-five percent
confidence in the causal

00:27:59.954 --> 00:28:03.269
relationship that you're
hypothesizing?

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:06.180
Or is it ninety-nine percent
confidence?

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.444
So that the standard of proof
that is applied before a

00:28:09.444 --> 00:28:13.203
decision is made is a critical
issue, and this can be adjusted

00:28:13.203 --> 00:28:14.930
if you're designing law.
 

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:18.420
Also national sovereignty to
regulate foreign hazards.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.737
There are a variety of
international standards set up

00:28:21.737 --> 00:28:24.480
to prevent the export of
hazardous waste.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.897
So there's quite a controversy
brewing right now about

00:28:27.897 --> 00:28:30.348
electronic waste being
transmitted,

00:28:30.348 --> 00:28:34.791
particularly to Asian nations,
which are trying to recycle the

00:28:34.791 --> 00:28:38.069
precious metals out of computer
equipment,

00:28:38.069 --> 00:28:39.568
old cell phones.
 

00:28:39.568 --> 00:28:44.996
And even though there maybe
only seventy-five cents per cell

00:28:44.996 --> 00:28:49.318
phone in terms of the value of
those metals,

00:28:49.318 --> 00:28:52.676
there are some three dozen
different metals that can be

00:28:52.676 --> 00:28:55.038
extracted from electronic
equipment.

00:28:55.038 --> 00:28:57.970
And if they're thrown away or
if they're burned,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.582
the material will go up into
the atmosphere or it will make

00:29:00.582 --> 00:29:02.788
its way down into the soil and
the groundwater.

00:29:02.788 --> 00:29:05.259
And also, the people that are
doing this,

00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:07.700
the people that are burning the
plastic off of the electronic

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.914
components and the metals,
they are often exposed at a

00:29:10.914 --> 00:29:11.818
high level.
 

00:29:11.818 --> 00:29:13.838
So that's a very interesting
problem.

00:29:13.838 --> 00:29:15.769
How could we regulate
international trade?

00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:18.528
Well, this issue of national
sovereignty is very important.

00:29:18.528 --> 00:29:21.528
Does one nation want another
nation telling it what it can

00:29:21.528 --> 00:29:22.578
and cannot import?
 

00:29:22.578 --> 00:29:28.117
Does it want to demand that
that nation adopt some sort of a

00:29:28.117 --> 00:29:30.089
universal standard?
 

00:29:30.089 --> 00:29:31.598
And the answer is clearly no.
 

00:29:31.598 --> 00:29:35.337
And finally,
what criteria would we use to

00:29:35.337 --> 00:29:40.808
choose among the possible legal
strategies that are there?

00:29:40.808 --> 00:29:44.836
So I'm going to skip really
quickly now to a variety of

00:29:44.836 --> 00:29:46.180
different cases.
 

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.605
And I'd like you to imagine a
society with no environmental

00:29:49.605 --> 00:29:49.960
law.
 

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.815
And by the way,
that was the United States back

00:29:52.815 --> 00:29:56.538
in 1950, when we had no Clean
Air Act, no Clean Water Act.

00:29:56.538 --> 00:30:00.335
And how would you design law in
order to assure a healthy,

00:30:00.335 --> 00:30:02.798
productive, and sustainable
future?

00:30:02.798 --> 00:30:06.115
That is a central question that
I hope you can address by the

00:30:06.115 --> 00:30:07.220
end of the course.
 

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.815
Now imagine a society in the
year 2010 as we sit here,

00:30:11.815 --> 00:30:16.410
where our law is fractured by
problem and by media.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:20.786
By media I mean air,
water, food or by problem type,

00:30:20.786 --> 00:30:25.848
hazardous wastes or hazardous
sites or pesticide problem.

00:30:25.848 --> 00:30:28.538
It's fractured by level of
government.

00:30:28.538 --> 00:30:30.078
There's very little
surveillance.

00:30:30.078 --> 00:30:32.269
It tends to evolve at a snail's
pace.

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:37.261
And a little anecdote there,
in a variety of decisions to

00:30:37.261 --> 00:30:41.720
regulate or license an
individual chemical or a new

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.286
product,
it often will take EPA up to a

00:30:45.286 --> 00:30:49.940
decade or fifteen years to go
through a review to determine

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:53.230
whether or not that chemical is
safe,

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:55.940
whether or not it poses
excessive risk,

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.048
or what the economic benefit is.
 

00:30:59.048 --> 00:31:03.395
If it's being reviewed under a
balancing and cost standard,

00:31:03.395 --> 00:31:05.720
so that -- now,
imagine this.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.645
Out of the 80,000 chemicals
that are out there in

00:31:07.645 --> 00:31:11.326
international commerce,
if it takes EPA fifteen years

00:31:11.326 --> 00:31:14.990
to review one chemical,
what does that tell you about

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.769
what their capacity is to manage
your exposure to dangerous

00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:18.250
things?
 

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.598
It tells you it's exceptionally
limited.

00:31:20.598 --> 00:31:24.778
Our system of law also provides
a false sense of security.

00:31:24.778 --> 00:31:30.567
Because most of us believe that
the little statements on the

00:31:30.567 --> 00:31:35.703
back of different products,
such as an herbicide in the

00:31:35.703 --> 00:31:38.795
hardware store that says,
"This is EPA's

00:31:38.795 --> 00:31:40.821
license,"
that's almost a certification

00:31:40.821 --> 00:31:42.519
of safety in most people's
minds.

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:44.641
Many people think,
"It wouldn't be on the

00:31:44.641 --> 00:31:47.375
marketplace if it was dangerous,
people have reviewed this,

00:31:47.375 --> 00:31:48.130
right?"
 

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:51.090
Well, by the time you're
finished with this course,

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:54.288
you will be thinking quite a
lot about that problem.

00:31:54.288 --> 00:31:58.488
So environmental law is also
highly specialized in the

00:31:58.488 --> 00:31:59.358
sciences.
 

00:31:59.358 --> 00:32:01.522
And as I just said,
about ninety-five percent of

00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:04.009
environmental science goes on in
the private sector.

00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:07.323
And what that means is that
they have a leg up,

00:32:07.323 --> 00:32:10.998
they have a competitive
advantage in controlling the

00:32:10.998 --> 00:32:14.240
narrative about the nature of
the danger.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:18.035
So that thinking about how to
set up an institution that

00:32:18.035 --> 00:32:21.624
really would produce science
that would be publically

00:32:21.624 --> 00:32:25.028
available,
that would be transparent,

00:32:25.028 --> 00:32:28.458
it would be open,
the data would be out there so

00:32:28.458 --> 00:32:29.930
you or I could review it.
 

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.568
I mean, that's a big obligation.
 

00:32:32.568 --> 00:32:36.578
It's also highly politicized in
its implementation.

00:32:36.578 --> 00:32:40.383
There are all sorts of stories
about regulators inside the Food

00:32:40.383 --> 00:32:43.800
and Drug Administration,
Occupational Safety and Health

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.921
Administration,
and the Environmental

00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:48.758
Protection Agency,
and how they move at fairly

00:32:48.758 --> 00:32:52.294
high levels from the agency
assistant administrator for

00:32:52.294 --> 00:32:55.828
toxic substances in EPA going to
work for Monsanto.

00:32:55.828 --> 00:33:01.490
They'll go to work for Monsanto
during periods of liberal

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:05.039
administration,
and then they'll come back into

00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:07.719
the administration during
periods of conservative

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:08.778
administrations.
 

00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:12.362
So that there's this revolving
door idea among top regulators

00:33:12.362 --> 00:33:14.808
that's extremely difficult to
regulate.

00:33:14.808 --> 00:33:19.726
Also, our system of law is very
poorly supported by the

00:33:19.726 --> 00:33:21.730
nonprofit community.
 

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:26.159
You may think that there's a
large network of nonprofits out

00:33:26.159 --> 00:33:29.163
there that are playing the
watchdog role,

00:33:29.163 --> 00:33:30.740
but you're wrong.
 

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.267
In fact, in the area of Safe
Drinking Water Act,

00:33:33.267 --> 00:33:35.578
there is no nonprofit in
Washington, D.C.

00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:38.712
that has taken the Safe
Drinking Water Act under its

00:33:38.712 --> 00:33:41.077
purview saying,
"This is our

00:33:41.077 --> 00:33:44.554
specialty,"
you can always count on them to

00:33:44.554 --> 00:33:48.695
be there to try to judge the
reasonableness of a proposed

00:33:48.695 --> 00:33:49.880
regulation.
 

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:55.487
Generally, the system of
environmental law that we've got

00:33:55.487 --> 00:33:57.190
is utilitarian.
 

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:01.250
It's balancing of costs and
benefits or risks or the

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:06.190
estimate of damages and what the
economic benefits might be.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:10.789
And inherent in that decision
standard is this problem.

00:34:10.789 --> 00:34:14.630
You've got costs that are
pretty easy to quantify.

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:17.239
And if you've got a firm that's
making a product,

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.509
they're going to tell you with
pretty good accuracy their

00:34:20.509 --> 00:34:24.070
opinion about what they would
lose if you took that right away

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:26.289
from them to produce that
product.

00:34:26.289 --> 00:34:30.375
Now, by contrast,
if you think about the damage

00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:35.081
side of the equation or the risk
side of the equation,

00:34:35.081 --> 00:34:38.989
that's a projection out into
the future.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:44.641
That's a probabilistic estimate
of what might happen into the

00:34:44.641 --> 00:34:45.489
future.
 

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:49.106
And the global warming
transformation in thinking that

00:34:49.106 --> 00:34:52.655
we've seen over the past decade
has really been quite

00:34:52.655 --> 00:34:53.679
remarkable.
 

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.606
Because people are thinking now
out over a long time horizon in

00:34:57.606 --> 00:34:59.760
ways that they never had before.
 

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.949
What is the climate going to be
like?

00:35:01.949 --> 00:35:04.786
And what's it going to do to
our ecosystems and to our

00:35:04.786 --> 00:35:07.730
shorelines and to our health 100
years down the road?

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.849
There were very few people that
think out in that long term.

00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:15.429
So how do you project damages
out over long periods of time?

00:35:15.429 --> 00:35:19.090
Well, you rely on very complex
computer models to do that,

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:22.005
so that you have to faith in
those who are doing the

00:35:22.005 --> 00:35:24.579
projection and the quality of
the analysis.

00:35:24.579 --> 00:35:29.742
So that this problem can be
kind of capsulized in the idea

00:35:29.742 --> 00:35:33.909
that costs are often relatively
well known,

00:35:33.909 --> 00:35:37.581
and they can be projected with
relative precision over the

00:35:37.581 --> 00:35:39.900
short term compared to the
harms,

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.119
the environmental and health
harms,

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:44.750
that are highly uncertain.
 

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:47.452
And they're often projected way
out into the future with a

00:35:47.452 --> 00:35:49.822
really fuzzy image of how
they're going to fall out

00:35:49.822 --> 00:35:51.530
differently on different groups.
 

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:54.779
Also, our system of
environmental law has been

00:35:54.779 --> 00:35:58.318
trivialized, I think,
by the concerns that we have

00:35:58.318 --> 00:36:01.639
over international security and
terrorism.

00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:06.320
Basically, nobody was talking
about environmental law for

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.664
several years,
between 2001 following the

00:36:09.664 --> 00:36:12.340
attack on the Trade Centers.
 

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:17.969
And 2004,2005 environmental law
came back to life.

00:36:17.969 --> 00:36:21.074
But even when the public is
asked what do you care about

00:36:21.074 --> 00:36:24.349
most in terms of problems that
the United States faces,

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:28.498
you will see issues such as the
economy regularly being first on

00:36:28.498 --> 00:36:29.289
that list.
 

00:36:29.289 --> 00:36:32.666
You'll see issues of national
security being in the top two or

00:36:32.666 --> 00:36:33.110
three.
 

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.460
But people are thinking about a
very different collection of

00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.780
problems rather than
environmental concern.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.411
We'll be talking about the
importance of a public

00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:46.648
perception of the environment
compared to these other social

00:36:46.648 --> 00:36:48.239
objectives in the future.
 

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:52.452
One other point I wanted to
make is that the estimates today

00:36:52.452 --> 00:36:56.664
are that the system that we have
in place now costs industry

00:36:56.664 --> 00:37:01.519
about $300 to $400 billion per
year in the United States alone,

00:37:01.519 --> 00:37:04.500
only in compliance costs.
 

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:06.420
That's pretty remarkable.
 

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.039
EPA and other groups have
reviewed this estimate,

00:37:09.039 --> 00:37:11.769
along with the Government
Accountability Office.

00:37:11.769 --> 00:37:14.869
That's a very large investment.
 

00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:17.969
So put the pieces together here
of what I've just told you.

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:20.842
I've told you that we have this
system of law that is not

00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:23.510
working very well,
for a whole variety of reasons.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:27.110
Now I'm telling you that this
is costing society an enormous

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:28.210
amount of money.
 

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.309
Well, does that make sense?
 

00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:33.360
We'll come back to that issue
during the term.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.554
Now I'm going to spend about
ten minutes just quickly

00:37:35.554 --> 00:37:38.001
reviewing some of the cases that
we'll go through that will

00:37:38.001 --> 00:37:39.900
demonstrate some of these key
principles.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:45.097
1954 was a turning point for
environmentalism in the nation

00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:50.382
and in the world because it
basically taught people to think

00:37:50.382 --> 00:37:55.670
at a global scale about nature
and about the environment for

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.000
the very first time.
 

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.949
And it's the result of this
explosion on the Bikini Atoll in

00:38:01.949 --> 00:38:05.699
the Marshall Islands that
punched up radioactive material

00:38:05.699 --> 00:38:07.440
into the stratosphere.
 

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.757
And at the time,
they thought that well,

00:38:09.757 --> 00:38:13.025
we had to worry about where it
would go, how it would be

00:38:13.025 --> 00:38:15.820
distributed, within a couple
hundred miles.

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:21.268
And a variety of mistakes were
made, including exposing people

00:38:21.268 --> 00:38:23.679
working for the military.
 

00:38:23.679 --> 00:38:28.460
This group of people was
sitting in these lawn chairs in

00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:31.329
their shorts and their caps on.
 

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:33.492
They had ski goggles on with
the dark lenses thinking,

00:38:33.492 --> 00:38:34.880
well, that would be safe
enough.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.402
There are many,
many stories about workers

00:38:37.402 --> 00:38:40.724
being exposed beyond what
normally we would think of as

00:38:40.724 --> 00:38:42.510
being a safe level today.
 

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:45.989
So what you don't know can hurt
you.

00:38:45.989 --> 00:38:48.344
And the more you ask about
chemical movement,

00:38:48.344 --> 00:38:51.126
the more we recognize that
chemicals actually persist

00:38:51.126 --> 00:38:53.159
longer than we thought they
would.

00:38:53.159 --> 00:38:57.512
They often move further in ways
that were non-intuitive through

00:38:57.512 --> 00:38:59.829
ecosystems, marine food chains.
 

00:38:59.829 --> 00:39:03.510
They may get deposited in the
landscape in different ways.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:06.856
We'll see next week when we
take this story apart that one

00:39:06.856 --> 00:39:10.380
of the major surprises was that
this material got into global

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.668
circulation so that everybody in
the world was exposed to

00:39:13.668 --> 00:39:16.360
radionuclides --
strontium-90,

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.949
iodine-131, cesium-137.
 

00:39:18.949 --> 00:39:22.188
And your parents are all
walking around today with those

00:39:22.188 --> 00:39:25.840
byproducts that often have half
lives of thousands of years.

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.159
So that these are really
important lessons.

00:39:29.159 --> 00:39:33.610
The Atomic Energy Commission
figured this out by 1955,1956.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:38.018
They figured out that these
radionuclides wouldn't just kind

00:39:38.018 --> 00:39:38.989
of go away.
 

00:39:38.989 --> 00:39:42.259
And that's been the perception
of most people about chemicals

00:39:42.259 --> 00:39:44.929
released to the environment,
they just go away.

00:39:44.929 --> 00:39:48.929
Many of them don't go away,
particularly radionuclides.

00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:51.510
And they move around the world.
 

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.099
They tend to settle down,
the heavier particles will

00:39:55.099 --> 00:39:57.070
settle down when it's dry.
 

00:39:57.070 --> 00:39:59.590
The finer particles tend to
aggregate.

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:03.099
And then when a rain cloud
intersects with a dust cloud as

00:40:03.099 --> 00:40:06.670
they settle down into lower
elements of the atmosphere,

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.980
that's when they rain down into
the earth.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:12.018
And that creates a patchy
pattern of contamination.

00:40:12.018 --> 00:40:15.402
It's a patchy pattern,
but we can figure out what the

00:40:15.402 --> 00:40:18.197
deposition rates were fifty
years ago today,

00:40:18.197 --> 00:40:20.280
just by taking soil samples.
 

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.739
It's very interesting.
 

00:40:21.739 --> 00:40:26.155
So that you can back-calculate
the half-life of cesium-137 or

00:40:26.155 --> 00:40:27.260
strontium-90.
 

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:33.438
And you see that it actually
plays out in a very patchy way

00:40:33.438 --> 00:40:39.404
that is dependent upon this
intersection between the dust

00:40:39.404 --> 00:40:42.599
cloud and the rain clouds.
 

00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:46.322
So the number one failure that
we'll see as we go through this

00:40:46.322 --> 00:40:49.742
case is a failure of systems
thinking, a failure to think

00:40:49.742 --> 00:40:50.780
ecologically.
 

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.724
But the Atomic Energy
Commission was clearly thinking

00:40:53.724 --> 00:40:55.309
ecologically back in 1955.
 

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:59.398
But then we've been waking up
over the past fifty to sixty

00:40:59.398 --> 00:41:03.630
years without really paying much
attention to this story.

00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:08.557
So that we'll see as the milk
was tested and the ground soil

00:41:08.557 --> 00:41:13.152
contamination levels of
strontium-90 were tested between

00:41:13.152 --> 00:41:18.331
the period of '54 and 1958 when
more atomic bombs were exploded

00:41:18.331 --> 00:41:22.760
than during any other period in
human history,

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:26.927
you see this correlation,
this rise in levels in the soil

00:41:26.927 --> 00:41:28.789
and levels in the milk.
 

00:41:28.789 --> 00:41:31.940
And then you see the levels in
the human diet going up during

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.880
the same period of time,
and the levels in human bone.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.260
They didn't know that.
 

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.639
They didn't know that at the
time they designed the bombs,

00:41:38.639 --> 00:41:43.364
so that they didn't know that
strontium-90 would compete with

00:41:43.364 --> 00:41:47.460
calcium to be fixed within bone
in the human body.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.259
But the Atomic Energy
Commission created this

00:41:51.259 --> 00:41:56.268
clandestine operation where they
collected dead bodies from

00:41:56.268 --> 00:42:01.362
15,000 people around the world
and they sent them to labs in

00:42:01.362 --> 00:42:07.150
Chicago and to Lamont Laboratory
and to Columbia University,

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:08.219
where they were tested.
 

00:42:08.219 --> 00:42:12.059
And every bone they tested
found strontium-90 in it.

00:42:12.059 --> 00:42:13.590
And it really woke them up.
 

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:17.907
You can find this story only
because this documentation that

00:42:17.907 --> 00:42:22.079
was formerly classified until
the mid to late 1990s is now

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:25.960
available in the declassified
documents database.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.420
It's really a fascinating story.
 

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.208
So these people were sitting
around in the Atomic Energy

00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:32.489
Commission's headquarters
actually saying,

00:42:32.489 --> 00:42:34.800
"Well, what is the law on
body snatching?"

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.699
They used that phrase,
body snatching.

00:42:36.699 --> 00:42:38.760
"Where are we going to get
cadavers?

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.000
Do we really have to ask
relatives about this?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.590
Well, what about homeless
people?"

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.626
So the Atomic Energy Commission
was collecting bones from around

00:42:46.626 --> 00:42:49.438
the world,
and they were able to build

00:42:49.438 --> 00:42:53.835
this map of the deposition rate
of strontium-90 by looking at

00:42:53.835 --> 00:42:57.661
bones that came from Argentina,
bones that came from South

00:42:57.661 --> 00:42:58.050
Africa.
 

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:01.909
I can just imagine what their
faces looked like when they saw

00:43:01.909 --> 00:43:05.771
the levels that were spanning
all latitudes and basically all

00:43:05.771 --> 00:43:07.380
nations in the world.
 

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.199
Well, this story gets repeated.
 

00:43:10.199 --> 00:43:14.061
It gets repeated chemical by
chemical as EPA begins to come

00:43:14.061 --> 00:43:18.672
to life in the 1970s and '80s,
begins to wake up in this case

00:43:18.672 --> 00:43:22.938
to polybrominated diphenyl
ethers that are these flame

00:43:22.938 --> 00:43:26.719
retardants that we now all walk
around with.

00:43:26.719 --> 00:43:30.376
And it's a common story that we
first find the chemicals in

00:43:30.376 --> 00:43:31.070
wildlife.
 

00:43:31.070 --> 00:43:32.340
Why?
 

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.599
Because they're easy to test.
 

00:43:33.599 --> 00:43:37.815
People generally don't like to
give bone samples so that their

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:40.510
bones can be tested for
strontium-90.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:43.599
By the way, there's an
interesting kind of way to

00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:46.820
figure out what's in your bone
by testing teeth.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:50.639
So by testing the deciduous
teeth of young kids,

00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:53.467
the Atomic Energy Commission
figured this out and they were

00:43:53.467 --> 00:43:56.148
actually going around from
dentist to dentist collecting

00:43:56.148 --> 00:43:58.166
teeth from people,
thinking, "why were we

00:43:58.166 --> 00:44:00.195
crazy enough to have to collect
bones from dead people when we

00:44:00.195 --> 00:44:01.559
could have just collected
teeth?"

00:44:01.559 --> 00:44:07.510
So you find this pattern of
recognition first in wildlife,

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:10.476
then they say, "Oh, boy,
now how did it get into the

00:44:10.476 --> 00:44:11.110
wildlife?"
 

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:13.119
And then gradually somebody
said, "Boy,

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:15.224
if it's in the wildlife,
it might be in humans

00:44:15.224 --> 00:44:15.880
too."
 

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.536
And gradually,
people started testing breast

00:44:18.536 --> 00:44:18.969
milk.
 

00:44:18.969 --> 00:44:22.853
Breast milk became the tissue
of choice in order to understand

00:44:22.853 --> 00:44:25.782
whether or not chemicals were
being transmitted

00:44:25.782 --> 00:44:27.309
transgenerationally.
 

00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:33.039
And also, it's easy to collect,
it is relatively inexpensive to

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:33.780
store.
 

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:36.623
And here's a good example of
DDT found in different nations

00:44:36.623 --> 00:44:38.929
around the world in breast milk
in the 1970s.

00:44:38.929 --> 00:44:42.376
So human tissue testing became
really an important way to

00:44:42.376 --> 00:44:44.900
figure out what people were
exposed to.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.567
And if you know that you find
it in somebody's body,

00:44:47.567 --> 00:44:50.130
then you have this kind of
interesting problem.

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.340
Well, how do I figure out where
I encountered it?

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.750
How was I exposed?
 

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:54.670
Did I breathe it?
 

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:55.909
Did I eat it in the food?
 

00:44:55.909 --> 00:44:57.090
Did it come in the drinking
water?

00:44:57.090 --> 00:45:00.251
So these are all questions that
EPA has faced on numerous

00:45:00.251 --> 00:45:00.929
occasions.
 

00:45:00.929 --> 00:45:04.847
This is the island of Vieques
that we'll spend a lecture on or

00:45:04.847 --> 00:45:07.994
two in a few weeks,
where I've worked for a couple

00:45:07.994 --> 00:45:08.829
of years.
 

00:45:08.829 --> 00:45:13.496
And I've worked on hazardous
defense sites and the process of

00:45:13.496 --> 00:45:17.230
their restoration for sites in
Massachusetts,

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.797
sites in California,
as well as sites in Puerto

00:45:20.797 --> 00:45:21.340
Rico.
 

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.934
And this is a fascinating story
that led me to understand how

00:45:24.934 --> 00:45:27.329
chemicals move through the food
chain.

00:45:27.329 --> 00:45:32.773
And this is a bombing run,
200 million pounds of bombs

00:45:32.773 --> 00:45:38.630
were dropped on this little
island over the period between

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:40.480
1940 and 2003.
 

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:43.208
So I wondered,
where did the chemicals in

00:45:43.208 --> 00:45:44.369
those bombs go?
 

00:45:44.369 --> 00:45:48.829
So I took students,
some from this class down.

00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:50.800
And we dove in this bay.
 

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:54.670
We found an old destroyer.
 

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:58.965
We found 2,000-pound bombs that
were as long as this stage and

00:45:58.965 --> 00:46:01.358
about that wide,
lying under water,

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:03.119
rusting out,
leaking.

00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:05.039
We found mounds of artillery
shells.

00:46:05.039 --> 00:46:09.130
I remember one case where my
goggles had fogged up and I came

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:13.356
to the surface and looked around
and looked and saw there was a

00:46:13.356 --> 00:46:17.447
tank on a hill that was only
about twenty meters from where I

00:46:17.447 --> 00:46:18.130
was.
 

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:20.755
And then I cleared my goggles
and I looked down,

00:46:20.755 --> 00:46:23.715
and I was within about two
feet, standing on a pile of

00:46:23.715 --> 00:46:24.889
artillery shells.
 

00:46:24.889 --> 00:46:27.530
And I hadn't really put two and
two together,

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:31.840
but destroyers had sat offshore
and for thirty,

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.695
forty years,
were lobbing these artillery

00:46:34.695 --> 00:46:38.480
shells at the tank on the hill
for target practice.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.369
And a bunch of them had missed
and piled up in the same place.

00:46:42.369 --> 00:46:44.670
So they're still sitting there.
 

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:46.340
I mean, I could take you there
now.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.900
We could still see the
2,000-pound bombs.

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.219
So the Base Closure and
Reclamation Act that was

00:46:52.219 --> 00:46:56.530
established that's closing down
a bunch of these bases has led

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:58.701
the Army,
the Air Force,

00:46:58.701 --> 00:47:01.739
the Navy to basically close
bases,

00:47:01.739 --> 00:47:05.909
walk away, and clean up
according to standards that they

00:47:05.909 --> 00:47:07.349
believe are safe.
 

00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:10.876
So this will be a story about
standard setting that turns into

00:47:10.876 --> 00:47:14.230
a story about chemicals moving
in the marine food chain.

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:15.260
You've heard about mercury in
tuna.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:19.128
You've probably heard about
mercury in shark and large

00:47:19.128 --> 00:47:20.369
predatory fish.
 

00:47:20.369 --> 00:47:25.494
But you probably haven't heard
about mercury in the array of

00:47:25.494 --> 00:47:29.750
tropical fish that exist in the
Caribbean seas.

00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:33.099
Well, that's because they
haven't been studied.

00:47:33.099 --> 00:47:36.768
People tend to look at the
chemicals in the larger fish.

00:47:36.768 --> 00:47:42.923
They tend to avoid the study of
this set of tropical fish,

00:47:42.923 --> 00:47:49.510
because these don't comprise a
large proportion of the U.S.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.672
average diet,
or rather high-income nations

00:47:51.672 --> 00:47:54.507
that would fund this kind of
research would not comprise

00:47:54.507 --> 00:47:55.280
their diet.
 

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.909
So the problem I faced in
Puerto Rico is wow,

00:47:59.909 --> 00:48:02.900
I know that these people eat a
lot of these fish and there are

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.550
probably two dozen that they eat
on a routine basis.

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:10.630
What happens to TNT,
HDX, which are explosives,

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:14.757
what happens to cadmium and
mercury and lead and aluminum

00:48:14.757 --> 00:48:16.572
and copper,
and a variety of other

00:48:16.572 --> 00:48:18.139
chemicals that are components of
munitions?

00:48:18.139 --> 00:48:19.900
How do they build up in fish?
 

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.010
And is this population more
exposed than others?

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:24.545
So that island communities,
whether it's the Marshall

00:48:24.545 --> 00:48:28.356
Islanders,
the Seychelles Islanders,

00:48:28.356 --> 00:48:31.992
the Viequense,
that had these diets that are

00:48:31.992 --> 00:48:34.807
very rich in fish,
they can be more exposed than

00:48:34.807 --> 00:48:35.280
others.
 

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.170
So I'm going to jump ahead
here, because I'm running out of

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:38.518
time.
 

00:48:38.518 --> 00:48:43.179
And I'll come back to these and
get to the final slide.

00:48:43.179 --> 00:48:47.869
See how much fun we're going to
have?

00:48:47.869 --> 00:48:50.639
I'm going to leave you today
with one image.

00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:53.070
I was up in the Wasatch last
week.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:59.018
I spent eight days in heaven,
so to speak.

00:48:59.018 --> 00:49:01.679
If any of you have not been to
the Wasatch, I encourage you to

00:49:01.679 --> 00:49:02.159
go there.
 

00:49:02.159 --> 00:49:06.949
This is just east of Salt Lake
City, about 10,000 feet in

00:49:06.949 --> 00:49:07.719
height.
 

00:49:07.719 --> 00:49:12.539
And standing there looking out
at these magnificent mountains,

00:49:12.539 --> 00:49:16.530
I suddenly realized,
given what I've told you today,

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:19.342
chemical movement through the
atmosphere through the

00:49:19.342 --> 00:49:22.255
environment,
I suddenly realized that the

00:49:22.255 --> 00:49:24.965
idea of wildness,
the idea of purity,

00:49:24.965 --> 00:49:28.646
the idea of environmental
quality that most people have

00:49:28.646 --> 00:49:32.054
and most people value,
is really being challenged by

00:49:32.054 --> 00:49:34.480
the way we're using and abusing
chemicals.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:39.315
So that the failure of law to
effectively control these

00:49:39.315 --> 00:49:43.072
chemicals,
to rain down in the snows in

00:49:43.072 --> 00:49:46.163
the Wasatch,
to get into the bodies of

00:49:46.163 --> 00:49:49.686
different species of wildlife,
into the plants and the

00:49:49.686 --> 00:49:52.460
animals, or to humans that are
drinking the water,

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:57.126
the failure to control that is
challenging our very sense of

00:49:57.126 --> 00:50:00.222
what wildness is,
of what purity is,

00:50:00.222 --> 00:50:01.820
of what nature is.
 

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:06.027
So I'm going to close there and
leave you with a sense of

00:50:06.027 --> 00:50:10.460
challenge that we need to think
about a different system.

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.757
We need to think about a
different way for law to work

00:50:13.757 --> 00:50:17.054
that could prevent this from
continuing through future

00:50:17.054 --> 00:50:18.050
generations.
 

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:19.809
Okay, that's it for today.
 

00:50:19.809 --> 00:50:20.699
Thank you.
 

00:50:20.699 --> 00:50:26.000

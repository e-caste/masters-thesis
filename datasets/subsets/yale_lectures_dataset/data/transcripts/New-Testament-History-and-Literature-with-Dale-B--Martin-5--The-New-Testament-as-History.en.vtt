00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.723
Prof: All right,
I ask you to come in with

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:08.981
definite lists of where Paul was
when, according to two different

00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:09.780
sources.
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.548
The purpose of the lecture
today is to get you to see what

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:19.484
you may think of as a historical
text as actually not a very

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:21.910
reliable historical text.
 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.000
This is not to say anything
about your faith;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.620
it's not to say anything about
how you might use this text

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.590
religiously or theologically.
 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.665
In other words,
it is not my intention to

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:38.356
attack the reliability of the
Bible for theological reading or

00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:42.100
for faith,
or your personal beliefs about

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.050
the Bible.
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.384
What we will do is demonstrate
a difference today between

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:51.100
reading this text theologically
as scripture,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.250
and reading it as historical
source,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.863
simply as a text,
or a series of texts,

00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:57.620
actually.
 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.603
Because as you know by now the
New Testament is a collection of

00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:00.990
texts.
 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.557
If you all you had were these
documents about the first

00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:06.030
several decades at the beginning
of Christianity,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.280
and as a matter of fact,
all you have as documents for

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.222
the first few decades of
Christianity are the New

00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:13.450
Testament texts.
 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.147
There are documents not in the
New Testament but they tend not

00:01:16.147 --> 00:01:18.140
to tell us anything we want to
know about,

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.045
for example,
the very beginnings of

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.670
Christianity as a movement.
 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.289
What you've got in the New
Testament comprise at least for

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:27.830
some of the earliest material we
have.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.670
If you want to know about the
life of Jesus,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.409
for example,
the four canonical gospels with

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.126
perhaps the Gospel of Thomas,
which we'll be reading later,

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.190
give you basically the only
information about Jesus of

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.330
Nazareth available to
historians,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.890
the same thing for Paul.
 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.080
There are second century
sources that talk about Paul,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.750
or that claim to be letters by
Paul,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.882
but most of us scholars don't
believe they have any

00:01:50.882 --> 00:01:53.300
historical,
reliable information.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.485
What we've got about Paul is
what you had in the New

00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:56.000
Testament.
 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.620
I'm going to try to get you to
use two of those sources,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.769
Galatians and the Acts of
Apostles,

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:04.423
and then we're going to talk
about what can we know about

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:05.750
Paul from these two texts.
 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.240
Now take your lists out that
you made for Acts.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.009
When is the first time we see
the Apostle Paul in Acts?

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.508
Chapter and verse.
 

00:02:19.508 --> 00:02:23.627
I'm a former fundamentalist,
which means I want chapter and

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:25.188
verse on everything.
 

00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:28.931
Chapter and verse,
when is the first time we see

00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:29.490
Paul?
 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.430
Yes sir.
 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.300
Student: 
&gt;

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.080
Prof: 9:1,
and where is he?

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.660
Student:  On the road to
Damascus.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.788
Prof: On the road to
Damascus.

00:02:41.788 --> 00:02:49.083
Starts off in Jerusalem--now is
that actually the first time we

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:52.729
see Paul in the book of Acts?
 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:54.318
Student:  In 7:58.
 

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:58.925
Prof: In 7:58,
so we actually see him before

00:02:58.925 --> 00:02:59.569
then.
 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.878
Where is he there?
 

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:06.210
Student: 
&gt;

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.401
Prof: That's right,
he witnesses the stoning of

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.115
Stephen,
who, by tradition,

00:03:12.115 --> 00:03:16.157
is the first Christian martyr,
the first person to die for

00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:17.849
Christianity in Acts.
 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.879
And he's in what city?
 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.389
Where is he?
 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.050
Come on folks, quicker, quicker.
 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.128
Where is he--
Student:  Jerusalem.

00:03:26.128 --> 00:03:31.270
Prof: He's in Jerusalem,
thank you.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.410
Now let's just read that first
part there,

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.854
"They dragged him out of
the city,"

00:03:35.854 --> 00:03:38.366
that is Stephen,
"Began to stone him,

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:41.980
the witnesses laid their coats
at the feet of a young man named

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.479
Saul," who the writer of
Acts will later tell us is also

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:48.508
named Paul,
so Saul is-- Acts depicts Saul

00:03:48.508 --> 00:03:52.384
as his Jewish name and Paul as
sort of his Greek and Roman

00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:52.930
name.
 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.123
"While they were stoning
Stephen he prayed,"

00:03:55.123 --> 00:03:56.160
and so on and so forth.
 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.770
Look at 8:1:
And Saul approved of their

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.449
killing him.
 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.156
That day a severe persecution
began against the church in

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:04.427
Jerusalem all except the
apostles were scattered

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:06.990
throughout the countryside of
Judea and Samaria,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.735
devout men buried Stephen,
and made loud lamentation over

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:11.763
him,
but Saul was ravaging the

00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:14.389
church by entering house after
house,

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.040
dragging off both men and
women, he committed them to

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.500
prison.
 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.076
So Saul, as he's known here,
is fairly active in Jerusalem

00:04:22.076 --> 00:04:25.610
as a persecutor of the followers
of Jesus.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.560
He causes several of them to be
arrested,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.560
they know who he is,
they would recognize him,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.636
he's got a reputation,
so that's the first time we see

00:04:34.636 --> 00:04:35.790
Paul in 7:58.
 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.904
Then we--the Acts,
as we'll see,

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:44.935
does a lot of other things and
then comes back to Paul now at

00:04:44.935 --> 00:04:45.740
9:1.
 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.730
After 9:1, when is the next
time we see Paul in Acts?

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.154
He's on the road to
Damascus--did you all do this

00:04:57.154 --> 00:04:57.940
homework?
 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.889
Yes sir in the back.
 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.160
Student:  12:25.
 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.088
Prof: 12:25--where is
that?

00:05:06.088 --> 00:05:15.759
Student: 
&gt;

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:18.726
Prof: Okay,
Barnabas and Paul go back to

00:05:18.726 --> 00:05:19.500
Jerusalem.
 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:25.069
Let's back up a bit though.
 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.050
I think we're missing some
stuff.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:37.391
I want every detail of time,
every detail of place--look at

00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:38.639
9:26.
 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.978
When he had come to Jerusalem,
he attempted to join the

00:05:41.978 --> 00:05:43.831
disciples;
and they were all afraid of

00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:45.850
him, for they did not believe he
was a disciple.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.000
But Barnabas took him,
brought him to the apostles,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.620
and described for them how on
the road he had seen the Lord,

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.678
who had spoken to him,
how in Damascus he had spoken

00:05:53.678 --> 00:05:54.889
boldly in the name of Jesus.
 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.651
So he went in and out among
them in Jerusalem,

00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:00.230
speaking boldly in the name of
the Lord.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.136
He spoke and argued with the
Hellenists [that is,

00:06:02.136 --> 00:06:04.391
Greek speaking Jews];
but they were attempting to

00:06:04.391 --> 00:06:04.889
kill him.
 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.913
When the believers learned of
it, they brought him down to

00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:09.930
Caesarea and sent him off to
Tarsus.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.903
Notice in Chapter 9 you've got
several chronological and

00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:16.000
spatial details about Paul.
 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.290
That's what I wanted you to
notice.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.968
Not just read it quickly,
don't read this stuff like

00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:23.896
college students,
read it as really critical

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:25.714
readers,
not just to get the reading

00:06:25.714 --> 00:06:26.889
done but notice the details.
 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:30.531
I'm stressing this now because
over and over again in this

00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:34.620
semester we'll try to push you
to read it much more carefully.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.560
Noticing details,
that's the only way to practice

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.540
close reading.
 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.899
We've got him in Jerusalem,
we have him in Damascus,

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:48.115
but before 12:25 we have lots
of other material with him being

00:06:48.115 --> 00:06:49.569
in Jerusalem.
 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:54.764
Introduced to the church
there--when is this

00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:56.940
chronologically?
 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.564
You don't have to know the year
but how much time are we talking

00:07:00.564 --> 00:07:03.788
about between this Damascus
period and this time Barnabas

00:07:03.788 --> 00:07:07.298
introduces him to the rest of
the church and gets him accepted

00:07:07.298 --> 00:07:08.449
by the church.
 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:10.759
Yes.
 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.884
Student:  It says in
verse 23, "After some time

00:07:12.884 --> 00:07:13.579
had passed."
 

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:15.480
Prof: "After some
time had passed."

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.694
There's one place where it says
he's three days in Damascus

00:07:18.694 --> 00:07:20.944
after he sees Jesus,
before he's baptized,

00:07:20.944 --> 00:07:22.983
so we have three days,
then he's baptized,

00:07:22.983 --> 00:07:25.560
and then he disputes with other
people in Damascus,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.459
so basically it's just after
some time.

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:30.699
It can't--we're probably not
talking several years here.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:37.588
You get the impression when
you're reading this that it may

00:07:37.588 --> 00:07:44.240
be months, it may be weeks--this
is time in Jerusalem.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.540
What happens after Barnabas
introduces him in Jerusalem?

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.615
Look at 9:30,
"When the believers

00:07:49.615 --> 00:07:52.923
learned of it they brought him
down to Caesarea and sent him

00:07:52.923 --> 00:07:54.269
off to Tarsus."
 

00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:57.944
Again, before we get him in
Jerusalem here,

00:07:57.944 --> 00:08:01.357
he's in Caesarea,
which is a city on the

00:08:01.357 --> 00:08:05.470
coastline of Palestine,
and he's in Tarsus.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.290
Why does he go to Tarsus do you
think?

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.449
That's his home, exactly.
 

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:15.689
According to Acts,
Paul is from Tarsus.

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:18.817
Now when we get further I'll
point out when we have

00:08:18.817 --> 00:08:22.259
information about Paul that we
get from his letters,

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:25.045
and when we have information
about Paul that we only get from

00:08:25.045 --> 00:08:25.370
Acts.
 

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.709
The question I'll ask you is,
are they both reliable?

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:30.160
Are they both equally reliable?
 

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.875
If you have one piece of
information from Paul's letters

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:35.740
and a different kind of piece of
information from Acts,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.038
is one of them more likely to
be historical?

00:08:37.038 --> 00:08:38.440
Those are the kinds of
questions we'll ask.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:38.879
Yes sir.
 

00:08:38.879 --> 00:08:40.058
Student:  Where is
Tarsus?

00:08:40.058 --> 00:08:44.974
Prof: Tarsus is in the
very eastern part of what is now

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:45.700
Turkey.
 

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.977
It's not far from the border of
eastern Turkey and western

00:08:50.977 --> 00:08:53.850
Syria, it's in modern Turkey.
 

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.440
At the time--at that time it
was in the area called Cilicia,

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.895
and that'll be important
because when we get to Galatians

00:08:59.895 --> 00:09:02.090
Paul talks about going to
Cilicia at one point,

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:04.764
and I'm going to say,
"Why did he go to Cilicia

00:09:04.764 --> 00:09:06.129
and where is that?"
 

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.936
And some smart person's going
to say, "Well isn't Tarsus

00:09:08.936 --> 00:09:11.788
the main capital city of Cilicia
in the Roman Empire?"

00:09:11.788 --> 00:09:13.548
I'll say, "That's
brilliant!

00:09:13.548 --> 00:09:17.038
You made a very important
connection there."

00:09:17.038 --> 00:09:22.341
Okay, so he goes to Tarsus,
now you don't hear much about

00:09:22.341 --> 00:09:27.168
Paul because then you have other
kinds of stuff,

00:09:27.168 --> 00:09:33.154
and then look at 11:19,
"Now those who were

00:09:33.154 --> 00:09:39.774
scattered because of the
persecutions that took place

00:09:39.774 --> 00:09:44.360
over Stephen,"
notice how--

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.460
we'll get this when we get to
the Acts of the Apostles,

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.154
the lecture on that,
there is as bit of a jump here

00:09:49.154 --> 00:09:50.450
in the period of time.
 

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.392
The stoning of Stephen was way
back there at the end of Chapter

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.216
7,
beginning of Chapter 8,

00:09:54.216 --> 00:09:55.210
then you had a lot of other
material,

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:58.148
now the author is kind of
taking you back to that stoning

00:09:58.148 --> 00:09:59.250
of Stephen episode.
 

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.259
This is like one of those
things that--it's a cutaway;

00:10:02.259 --> 00:10:06.320
it's a time lapse sort of in
the filming here....

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.096
[they]
traveled as far as Phoenicia,

00:10:08.096 --> 00:10:10.583
Cyprus, and Antioch,
and they spoke the word to no

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:11.600
one except Jews.
 

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.134
But among them were some men
from Cyprus and Cyrene who,

00:10:14.134 --> 00:10:16.440
on coming to Antioch,
spoke to the Hellenists also,

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.870
proclaiming the Lord Jesus.
 

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.162
The hand of the Lord was with
them, and a great number became

00:10:20.162 --> 00:10:21.500
believers and turned to the
Lord.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.621
News of this came to the ears
of the church in Jerusalem,

00:10:24.621 --> 00:10:26.629
and they sent Barnabas to
Antioch.

00:10:26.629 --> 00:10:29.163
When he came and saw the grace
of God, he rejoiced and he

00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:31.518
exhorted them all to remain
faithful to the Lord with

00:10:31.518 --> 00:10:33.640
steadfast devotion;
for he was a good man full of

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.759
the Holy Spirit and of faith.
 

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:36.629
And a great many people were
brought to the Lord.

00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:40.178
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to
look for Saul.

00:10:40.178 --> 00:10:48.378
Again, before we get this,
we have Saul going to Antioch,

00:10:48.378 --> 00:10:56.870
again Barnabas being the
important figure who does that.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.120
When he came he saw the grace
of God, etc.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.673
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to
look for Saul,

00:11:02.673 --> 00:11:07.019
and when he had found him,
he brought him to Antioch.

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:09.331
So it was that for an entire
year they met with the church

00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:12.038
and taught a great many people,
and it was in Antioch that the

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:14.340
disciples were first called
"Christians."

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.860
At that time prophets came down
from Jerusalem.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:22.062
[So we have one year here in
Antioch before the next incident

00:11:22.062 --> 00:11:24.794
happens.]
One of them named Agabus stood

00:11:24.794 --> 00:11:28.857
up and predicted by the Spirit
that there would be a severe

00:11:28.857 --> 00:11:32.323
famine over all the world;
this took place during the

00:11:32.323 --> 00:11:33.220
reign of Claudius.
 

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.940
The disciples determined that
according to their ability,

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.710
each would send relief to the
brothers living in Judea;

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.807
this they did,
sending it to the elders by

00:11:41.807 --> 00:11:43.320
Barnabas and Saul.
 

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:52.514
So in 11:30 we have Paul going
from Antioch with Barnabas to

00:11:52.514 --> 00:11:57.647
Jerusalem,
taking with them funds to

00:11:57.647 --> 00:12:01.951
alleviate famine--
for famine relief in Judea,

00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:04.178
from the disciples in Antioch.
 

00:12:04.178 --> 00:12:11.379
When's the--now after that do
we have another we see Paul?

00:12:11.379 --> 00:12:15.460
That's when you get to 12:25,
"Barnabas--

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.022
after completing their mission
Barnabas and Saul returned to

00:12:18.022 --> 00:12:19.759
Jerusalem and brought with them
John,

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:21.799
whose other name was Mark."
 

00:12:27.788 --> 00:12:31.798
Actually, I think that may need
to be returned from Jerusalem;

00:12:31.798 --> 00:12:36.083
there's a manuscript debate
over whether they returned to

00:12:36.083 --> 00:12:38.379
Jerusalem or from Jerusalem.
 

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:40.985
In any case,
they're in Jerusalem,

00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:45.799
and then 13:1 we find them back
in Barnabas, Barnabas and Saul

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:46.590
there.
 

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:55.740
Chapter 13 has Barnabas and
Saul in Antioch again.

00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:04.639
While they were worshipping the
Lord and fasting,

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:06.138
the Holy Spirit said,
"Set apart from me

00:13:06.138 --> 00:13:07.908
Barnabas and Saul for the work
to which I have called

00:13:07.908 --> 00:13:08.418
them."
 

00:13:08.418 --> 00:13:10.974
Then after fasting and praying
they laid their hands on them

00:13:10.974 --> 00:13:11.840
and sent them off.
 

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.998
They went by the Holy Spirit,
they went to Seleucia,

00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:18.590
then we have what's called the
first missionary journey.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:20.759
This is the first missionary
journey,

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:23.485
Barnabas and Paul,
they travel through that part

00:13:23.485 --> 00:13:26.966
of central and southern Turkey
that we call Asia Minor in the

00:13:26.966 --> 00:13:29.419
ancient world,
called Turkey now.

00:13:29.419 --> 00:13:31.169
What happens next?
 

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:36.320
After 13:1 where does Paul go?
 

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.048
Yes sir.
 

00:13:38.048 --> 00:13:40.490
Student: 
&gt;

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.828
Prof: Okay,
so they have a confrontation

00:13:42.828 --> 00:13:44.610
with a magician called
Bar-Jesus.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.309
Where else?
 

00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:47.970
Yes.
 

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.928
Student:  Cyprus
Prof: Cyprus.

00:13:50.928 --> 00:13:53.600
Student:  Salamis and
Paphos.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.291
Prof: Yes,
Cyprus and Salamis,

00:13:55.291 --> 00:13:56.559
they're traveling around.
 

00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:57.740
Where else?
 

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.558
Where do they end up?
 

00:13:59.558 --> 00:14:02.548
Student: 
&gt;

00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:05.490
Prof: Iconium,
that's another place they go

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:05.850
too.
 

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.950
Next?
 

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:07.460
Student:  Lystra.
 

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.750
Prof: Lystra.
 

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.620
Student:  Derbe.
 

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.210
Prof: Derbe, next?
 

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.590
Student:  Perga.
 

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.899
Prof: Perga.
 

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:15.460
Next?
 

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.519
Student:  Attalia.
 

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.080
Prof: Attalia.
 

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.458
Where do they end up after that
first journey,

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:21.940
at the end of the journey?
 

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.929
Student:  Antioch.
 

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:29.250
Prof: Back in Antioch.
 

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:34.558
We're going to just include all
those places you said in the

00:14:34.558 --> 00:14:39.509
first missionary journey,
and they end up in Antioch.

00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:42.909
Where is the next place they go?
 

00:14:42.909 --> 00:14:44.210
Student:  Jerusalem.
 

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:45.788
Prof: Jerusalem.
 

00:14:45.788 --> 00:14:48.450
What do they do this time in
Jerusalem?

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.070
Student: 
&gt;

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.460
Prof: Sorry?
 

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.129
They have a debate.
 

00:14:53.129 --> 00:14:55.408
The whole--the leaders of the
church get together,

00:14:55.408 --> 00:14:57.549
they debate,
what's the topic of the debate?

00:14:57.549 --> 00:14:58.149
Student:  Circumcision.
 

00:14:58.149 --> 00:15:01.380
Prof: Whether Gentiles
have to be circumcised to be

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.500
members of the community,
and who makes the decision?

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:04.669
Student: 
&gt;

00:15:04.669 --> 00:15:06.230
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.928
Who makes the decision?
 

00:15:07.928 --> 00:15:08.928
Student: 
&gt;

00:15:08.928 --> 00:15:11.210
Prof: Somebody say it
out loud enough.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:12.450
Student: 
&gt;

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:13.440
Prof: Sorry?
 

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:13.950
Student:  James.
 

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.080
Prof: James.
 

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.788
They all make the decision
together.

00:15:16.788 --> 00:15:19.134
In fact, they say,
"It seemed good to the

00:15:19.134 --> 00:15:20.700
Holy Spirit and to us."
 

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.375
That's an interesting way of
putting it because in the Book

00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:25.957
of Acts the Holy Spirit is
actually the main actor of the

00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:26.649
whole book.
 

00:15:26.649 --> 00:15:29.481
The Holy Spirit does all this
kind of stuff in the Book of

00:15:29.481 --> 00:15:31.365
Acts,
so that's why "The Acts of

00:15:31.365 --> 00:15:33.379
the Apostles"
is almost a mis-title.

00:15:33.379 --> 00:15:35.287
It should actually be called
"The Acts of the Holy

00:15:35.287 --> 00:15:36.735
Spirit,"
much more accurately for the

00:15:36.735 --> 00:15:37.230
narrative.
 

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.519
The Holy Spirit,
with all the believers,

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:43.020
and James, who's considered the
leader of the church in

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.808
Jerusalem actually announces a
decision,

00:15:45.808 --> 00:15:48.460
but it's a decision they all
came to by consensus.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.038
Everybody agrees that,
no, Gentiles don't have to be

00:15:51.038 --> 00:15:53.009
circumcised and they make some
rules.

00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:56.019
They say that they shouldn't
eat meat sacrificed to idols,

00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:58.791
they shouldn't eat blood,
they shouldn't commit

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.960
fornication or sexual
immorality,

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.846
so they make some rules that
they expect Gentile followers to

00:16:04.846 --> 00:16:05.428
follow.
 

00:16:05.428 --> 00:16:09.095
They get those rules from the
Jewish tradition that these were

00:16:09.095 --> 00:16:12.220
the rules that were given to
Noah after the flood.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.322
Therefore, all people in the
world, because all people of

00:16:15.322 --> 00:16:18.815
course that now exist came from
the people who lived through the

00:16:18.815 --> 00:16:19.370
flood.
 

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.610
All people of the world were
given these rules,

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.350
even Gentiles,
and so even pious Gentiles

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.316
should keep these rules,
although they do not have to be

00:16:28.316 --> 00:16:30.710
circumcised,
so that's the way that happens.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.980
Where does Paul go after that?
 

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:33.309
We're going to move quickly now.
 

00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.870
Student:  Antioch.
 

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.320
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:35.590
Student:  Antioch.
 

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.509
Prof: Antioch,
back to Antioch.

00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:40.654
Then he and Barnabas have a
falling out--have a

00:16:40.654 --> 00:16:41.678
disagreement.
 

00:16:41.678 --> 00:16:44.700
What's the disagreement between
Paul and Barnabas about in Acts?

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.308
Student:  Whether to
take John Mark.

00:16:46.308 --> 00:16:48.413
Prof: Whether to take
John Mark with him on them on

00:16:48.413 --> 00:16:49.408
the next journey they go.
 

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:52.520
Paul wants to--Barnabas wants
to take Mark,

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.263
Paul doesn't,
is that the way it goes?

00:16:55.263 --> 00:16:55.929
Yeah.
 

00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:57.450
Then they split up.
 

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.230
It's a very amicable split in
Acts, right?

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.340
It's a personnel decision.
 

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.440
They don't have any debates
about doctrine.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.243
They don't have any
disagreements about what the

00:17:07.243 --> 00:17:08.140
Gospel means.
 

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:11.461
They don't have any
disagreements about eating or

00:17:11.461 --> 00:17:12.500
circumcision.
 

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.247
Barnabas and Saul,
and Paul, split up simply over

00:17:15.247 --> 00:17:18.567
a personnel decision about
whether to take John Mark on the

00:17:18.567 --> 00:17:20.170
next missionary journey.
 

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.220
So that's--notice what we've
got.

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:28.851
How often is Paul in Jerusalem
before that--before this main

00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:31.099
Jerusalem counsel?
 

00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:32.359
How many times?
 

00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:32.960
Student:  Once.
 

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.136
Prof: One,
two, three, four,

00:17:37.136 --> 00:17:43.482
five--he's in Jerusalem five
times before the general counsel

00:17:43.482 --> 00:17:49.299
that we sort of ended up our
little narrative there.

00:17:49.299 --> 00:17:56.220
Now look at Galatians.
 

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.071
We don't have to go all the way
through Galatians,

00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:02.215
but we're going to read the
part of Galatians much more

00:18:02.215 --> 00:18:03.730
carefully and closely.
 

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:08.058
It's only basically the first
two chapters that we need.

00:18:08.058 --> 00:18:11.230
Again, we're going to put the
details up on the board,

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.333
because I want you to pay much
closer attention to this

00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:17.150
than apparently some of
you paid anyway.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.288
1:11, "I want you to know
brothers,"

00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:28.133
and it may say,
"and sisters"

00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:30.431
in your English translation,
but it doesn't in the Greek,

00:18:30.431 --> 00:18:32.934
"That the Gospel that was
proclaimed by me is not of human

00:18:32.934 --> 00:18:34.700
origin,
for I did not receive it from a

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:36.263
human source,
nor was I taught it,

00:18:36.263 --> 00:18:38.390
but I received it through a
revelation of Jesus

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:39.130
Christ."
 

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:42.467
First Paul starts out in the
letter saying,

00:18:42.467 --> 00:18:46.440
"I didn't get my Gospel
from any human person,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.538
I got it straight from
Jesus."

00:18:49.538 --> 00:18:51.631
Now, remember,
Paul didn't know Jesus during

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.897
Jesus' own lifetime,
so he's referring to a

00:18:53.897 --> 00:18:56.925
revelation experience that he
had when he saw Jesus in some

00:18:56.925 --> 00:18:59.722
kind of visionary experience,
or another place he says he was

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:02.387
lifted up into the third heaven,
so we'll talk at some point

00:19:02.387 --> 00:19:05.420
about what kind of experience
was this that Paul had,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.500
but that's where he got his
Gospel.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.448
You have heard,
no doubt, of my earlier life in

00:19:10.448 --> 00:19:11.088
Judaism.
 

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:14.040
I was violently persecuting the
church of God and was trying to

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.660
destroy it.
 

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.769
I advanced in Judaism beyond
many among my people of the same

00:19:17.769 --> 00:19:21.140
age, for I was more zealous for
the traditions of my ancestors.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.076
But when God,
who had set me apart before I

00:19:23.076 --> 00:19:24.919
was born,
called me through his grace,

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:27.588
was pleased so that I might
proclaim among the Gentiles,

00:19:27.588 --> 00:19:31.088
I did not confer with any human
being.

00:19:31.088 --> 00:19:34.480
Now where is Paul at this point
according to his own statement?

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:40.558
We don't know, right?
 

00:19:40.558 --> 00:19:44.420
But we know one place he's not,
and where is that?

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.578
Student:  Jerusalem.
 

00:19:45.578 --> 00:19:47.220
Prof: Because then he
says,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.794
"I did not,
nor did I go up to Jerusalem to

00:19:50.794 --> 00:19:54.140
those who are already Apostles
before me,

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.136
but I went away at once into
Arabia and afterwards I returned

00:19:58.136 --> 00:19:59.470
to Damascus."
 

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.690
That's how you know where he
was.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.450
"I returned to
Damascus."

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:10.096
Where is the first place we see
Paul, chronologically,

00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:13.517
geographically,
according to his letter,

00:20:13.517 --> 00:20:14.920
is Damascus.
 

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:28.440
Let's keep--then he says,
"I went to Arabia."

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.994
Arabia at this time refers to
the part of the other side of

00:20:32.994 --> 00:20:36.792
the Jordan River from Judea,
so it's what we would call

00:20:36.792 --> 00:20:39.464
modern Jordan mainly,
maybe eastern Syria,

00:20:39.464 --> 00:20:43.788
western Jordan but that's what
was Arabian desert that's--

00:20:43.788 --> 00:20:46.416
so he's talking about he went
away to that area that we would

00:20:46.416 --> 00:20:47.950
now call eastern Syria or
Jordan.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.988
Remember Damascus is one of the
large cities in Syria,

00:20:52.988 --> 00:20:55.460
so that's where he goes.
 

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:01.019
"Afterwards I returned to
Damascus.

00:21:01.019 --> 00:21:05.131
After three years,"
we get a nice little

00:21:05.131 --> 00:21:09.710
chronological note,
"I did go to Jerusalem to

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.859
visit Cephas."
 

00:21:11.859 --> 00:21:13.710
Who is Cephas?
 

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.308
Peter, exactly.
 

00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:17.683
Cephas is the Aramaic
word for "rock"

00:21:17.683 --> 00:21:19.923
or "stone,"
and Peter is the Greek

00:21:19.923 --> 00:21:22.210
word for "rock"
or "stone."

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.618
Again, we have two different
names.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:30.814
He goes to Jerusalem to meet
Peter, but he says,

00:21:30.814 --> 00:21:36.118
"And I stayed with him for
15 days."

00:21:36.118 --> 00:21:44.190
This first trip in Jerusalem
takes 15 days.

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:50.813
Notice what he says then,
"But I did not see any

00:21:50.813 --> 00:21:57.818
other apostle except James,
the Lord's brother."

00:21:57.818 --> 00:22:00.068
Student: 
&gt;

00:22:00.068 --> 00:22:01.490
Prof: Is that Jesus'
brother?

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.690
Yes, somebody said.
 

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.829
According to Roman Catholic
tradition Jesus didn't have any

00:22:05.829 --> 00:22:07.951
brothers,
but according to the New

00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:11.079
Testament he did have brothers
and maybe sisters,

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.808
according to some manuscripts.
 

00:22:12.808 --> 00:22:16.509
James is called the brother of
Jesus in the Book of Acts.

00:22:16.509 --> 00:22:19.607
Don't confuse this with James,
son of Zebedee who was one of

00:22:19.607 --> 00:22:22.130
the twelve apostles,
that's a different James.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:24.221
There are several James'
because it was a very common

00:22:24.221 --> 00:22:25.348
name in the ancient world.
 

00:22:25.348 --> 00:22:27.190
You know of course,
"James"

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.490
is just the Anglicization of
Jacob,

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:33.166
so it's actually Jacob
in the Greek and that's the word

00:22:33.166 --> 00:22:33.650
it is.
 

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:35.220
It becomes "James"
in English.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.118
"James, the Lord's brother.
 

00:22:37.118 --> 00:22:42.838
In what I'm writing to you
before God I do not lie."

00:22:42.838 --> 00:22:48.140
What--why does Paul have his
panties in a wad?

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:52.560
Confirming that he only was
there fifteen days,

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.828
and he only saw Peter and
James.

00:22:55.828 --> 00:22:59.730
I swear it, I swear it,
I swear it.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:06.140
"Then I went into the
regions of Syria and

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.368
Cilicia."
 

00:23:08.368 --> 00:23:11.670
Why do you think he went to
Cilicia?

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:12.838
Student:  To
&gt;

00:23:12.838 --> 00:23:14.568
Prof: That's where
Tarsus is.

00:23:14.568 --> 00:23:17.710
Maybe that's a clue that he
actually was from Tarsus,

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:20.450
although Paul doesn't ever tell
us he's from Tarsus,

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:23.230
so we don't know that's his
hometown from him but that's

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:24.900
what Acts says is his hometown.
 

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.680
So maybe he went to Tarsus,
we don't know.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.960
He just says he went to Syria.
 

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.368
I was still unknown by sight to
the churches of Judea that are

00:23:32.368 --> 00:23:34.058
in Christ;
they only heard it said,

00:23:34.058 --> 00:23:36.226
"The one who formerly was
persecuting us is now

00:23:36.226 --> 00:23:38.349
proclaiming the faith he once
tried to destroy.

00:23:38.349 --> 00:23:39.519
And they glorified God.
 

00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:43.558
"I was not known by
sight,"--

00:23:43.558 --> 00:23:45.375
they heard my reputation,
they heard that I had

00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:49.017
persecuted followers of Jesus,
but nobody, no follower of

00:23:49.017 --> 00:23:53.871
Jesus in Judea knew what I
looked like except Peter and

00:23:53.871 --> 00:23:54.680
James.
 

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.858
He swears it, he's very adamant.
 

00:23:57.858 --> 00:24:02.657
"Then after fourteen
years," so we have a

00:24:02.657 --> 00:24:07.106
fourteen year period of time,
"I went up again with

00:24:07.106 --> 00:24:09.660
Barnabas,
taking Titus along with me;

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.028
I went up in response to a
revelation."

00:24:12.028 --> 00:24:14.160
Why does he say he went up in
response to a revelation?

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.460
Anybody have an idea?
 

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.720
Yes, no.
 

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:24.165
As we'll see throughout this
letter, Paul wants to make it

00:24:24.165 --> 00:24:28.613
very clear that he is not
playing second fiddle to anybody

00:24:28.613 --> 00:24:29.940
in Jerusalem.
 

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.288
He didn't get his gospel from
those disciples,

00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:35.400
he didn't get it from Peter and
James,

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.096
he got it straight from Jesus,
he didn't check his Gospel out

00:24:39.096 --> 00:24:40.700
with them at this point.
 

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.190
He got it from Jesus.
 

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:45.755
Paul is trying to establish his
independence from the church in

00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:49.148
Jerusalem and he's eventually
going to try establishing that

00:24:49.148 --> 00:24:52.368
"I'm just as much an
apostle as they are."

00:24:52.368 --> 00:24:54.215
"I went up in response
to"--in other words he went

00:24:54.215 --> 00:24:55.250
up in response to a revelation.
 

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.226
God appeared--God told Paul,
according to him,

00:24:58.226 --> 00:25:00.210
"Go to Jerusalem."
 

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:03.740
He didn't go because the
Jerusalem authorities said,

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.625
"We need to check you out
and see if you're going to come

00:25:06.625 --> 00:25:07.618
to Jerusalem."
 

00:25:07.618 --> 00:25:09.788
They did--this was not a
command performance he's

00:25:09.788 --> 00:25:10.328
insisting.
 

00:25:10.328 --> 00:25:13.836
I laid before them (though only
in private meeting with the

00:25:13.836 --> 00:25:16.665
acknowledged leaders),
the Gospel that I proclaim

00:25:16.665 --> 00:25:19.125
among the Gentiles,
in order to make sure that I

00:25:19.125 --> 00:25:21.118
was not running or had not run
in vain.

00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:23.461
But even Titus,
who was with me was not

00:25:23.461 --> 00:25:26.730
compelled to be circumcised,
though he was a Greek.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:30.048
But because of false believers
secretly [he calls it false

00:25:30.048 --> 00:25:32.376
brothers]
secretly brought in who slipped

00:25:32.376 --> 00:25:35.868
in to spy out the freedom that
we have in Christ Jesus,

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:39.104
so that they might enslave
us--we did not submit to them

00:25:39.104 --> 00:25:41.523
even for a moment,
so that the truth of the Gospel

00:25:41.523 --> 00:25:42.670
might always remain with you.
 

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.527
And from those who are supposed
to be acknowledged leaders (what

00:25:45.527 --> 00:25:47.660
they actually were makes no
difference to me;

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.098
God shows no partiality) ...
 

00:25:49.098 --> 00:25:52.577
Notice again Paul is really
kind of anxious about not

00:25:52.577 --> 00:25:56.722
wanting to cede any authority to
these Jerusalem leaders except

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:58.930
as they are local leaders....
 

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.058
those leaders contributed
nothing new to me.

00:26:02.058 --> 00:26:04.286
On the contrary,
when they saw that I had been

00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:06.808
entrusted with the Gospel for
the uncircumcised,

00:26:06.808 --> 00:26:09.141
just as Peter had been
entrusted with the Gospel for

00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:11.747
the circumcised (for he worked
through Peter making him an

00:26:11.747 --> 00:26:14.045
apostle to the circumcised,
also worked through me and

00:26:14.045 --> 00:26:17.167
sending me to the Gentiles),
and when James and Cephas and

00:26:17.167 --> 00:26:19.169
John,
[this is James the Lord's

00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:22.200
brother, Cephas Peter,
and then the disciple John]

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.117
who were acknowledged pillars,
recognized the grace that had

00:26:25.117 --> 00:26:27.037
been given to me,
they gave to Barnabas and me

00:26:27.037 --> 00:26:29.887
the right and the fellowship,
agreeing that we should go to

00:26:29.887 --> 00:26:32.000
the Gentiles and they to the
circumcised.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.778
They asked only one thing,
that we remember the poor,

00:26:34.778 --> 00:26:37.130
which was actually what I was
eager to do.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:38.930
Now there's a big question here.
 

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.434
Is what Paul is describing here
basically this Jerusalem

00:26:43.434 --> 00:26:44.500
conference?
 

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.058
Is it his version?
 

00:26:47.058 --> 00:26:50.247
It's quite different the way
Paul--Paul acts like it's mainly

00:26:50.247 --> 00:26:53.328
him and sort of the leaders of
the Jerusalem church who get

00:26:53.328 --> 00:26:54.019
together.
 

00:26:54.019 --> 00:26:57.440
It's not--it wasn't brought
about by some crisis.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.074
Paul went because God told him
to do, so they could all just

00:27:00.074 --> 00:27:01.858
make sure that they have an
agreement.

00:27:01.858 --> 00:27:03.961
They make an agreement,
Gentiles don't have to

00:27:03.961 --> 00:27:06.671
circumcised, nobody pressured,
except these false brothers,

00:27:06.671 --> 00:27:07.980
Titus to be circumcised.
 

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:10.660
The pillars Peter,
James, and John did not insist

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:13.953
that Gentiles be circumcised,
they agreed with Peter's--with

00:27:13.953 --> 00:27:14.960
Paul's gospel.
 

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:19.344
The next thing that happened
though--so look how--what Paul

00:27:19.344 --> 00:27:22.744
says, he starts in Damascus,
he was in Arabia,

00:27:22.744 --> 00:27:24.559
and here's Damascus.
 

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:27.700
Three-year period of time;
he's in Jerusalem but only

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.599
fifteen days.
 

00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:30.730
He only sees Peter and James.
 

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:33.400
Then he goes back--goes to
Syria and Cilicia,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.598
and then after fourteen years
later--

00:27:35.598 --> 00:27:38.570
some scholars say,
well is this fourteen years

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:40.420
including the three years?
 

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.938
That is, is this fourteen years
from his revelation or do we

00:27:42.938 --> 00:27:43.920
have seventeen years?
 

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.133
When you try to figure out the
chronology for Paul's ministry

00:27:47.133 --> 00:27:49.328
in life you have to make that
decision.

00:27:49.328 --> 00:27:52.051
I think that much more likely
is this fourteen years is

00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:54.825
considered to be fourteen years
after these three years,

00:27:54.825 --> 00:27:56.538
so you've got seventeen years.
 

00:27:56.538 --> 00:28:00.642
That would put this Jerusalem
meeting about seventeen years

00:28:00.642 --> 00:28:04.250
after Paul's own conversion if
he was converted--

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.183
he seems to be converted very
early or called to be an apostle

00:28:07.183 --> 00:28:07.808
very early.
 

00:28:07.808 --> 00:28:10.480
Jesus died around the year 30
perhaps.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:13.558
Paul--let's just say Paul got
his revelation at 34,

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:18.672
so you would be talking
seventeen years after say 34 or

00:28:18.672 --> 00:28:21.019
35,
is when you have this Jerusalem

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:21.710
conference.
 

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.970
Then you have the next thing.
 

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.210
Now what happens next though?
 

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:30.020
Now, what that basically is
saying--let's just stop here and

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.609
let me say, how do you make this
fit this?

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:36.470
How do you make this fit this?
 

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:39.672
Over here you have Paul
starting off in Jerusalem,

00:28:39.672 --> 00:28:42.088
and he's persecuting the
disciples.

00:28:42.088 --> 00:28:47.058
How can he then say over here
that they had never seen his

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:47.670
face?
 

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:51.318
Were all of them dead by this
time?

00:28:51.318 --> 00:28:55.349
He swears they didn't know his
face, which seems to me to say

00:28:55.349 --> 00:28:59.046
that Paul is claiming he wasn't
in Jerusalem when he was

00:28:59.046 --> 00:29:00.858
persecuting the church.
 

00:29:00.858 --> 00:29:05.358
He was persecuting Christians
in Syria.

00:29:05.358 --> 00:29:09.428
He was persecuting followers of
Jesus in the Jewish Diaspora,

00:29:09.428 --> 00:29:10.920
not in Judea at all.
 

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.308
That's what Paul's claiming.
 

00:29:12.308 --> 00:29:14.473
And then he goes to Damascus,
he goes to Jerusalem for

00:29:14.473 --> 00:29:16.230
fifteen days but only sees these
people,

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:20.731
and it's seventeen years total
is the first time he's seen

00:29:20.731 --> 00:29:25.548
publicly in Jerusalem by many
different followers of Jesus.

00:29:25.548 --> 00:29:29.078
That just doesn't seem to fit
here.

00:29:29.078 --> 00:29:31.130
Here he starts off in
Jerusalem, he's in Jerusalem

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.516
again, he goes to Damascus,
but it seems like it's only in

00:29:33.516 --> 00:29:35.190
a matter of weeks or months
perhaps.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:39.630
He's in Antioch for a year,
he goes back to Jerusalem,

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.119
then he's in Antioch for a
year, he goes back to Jerusalem

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:43.040
here,
he's back to Jerusalem here,

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.674
back to Jerusalem here,
he's in and out of Judea and

00:29:46.674 --> 00:29:48.480
Jerusalem all the time.
 

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.618
Which one of these is accurate?
 

00:29:52.618 --> 00:29:55.880
Or do you believe that--you can
find really,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.654
really brilliant
fundamentalists who believe that

00:29:58.654 --> 00:30:02.352
the Bible has to be historically
and scientifically true in every

00:30:02.352 --> 00:30:04.590
one of its details,
and you know what,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.240
they can kind of figure out how
to harmonize all this,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.808
but it takes a lot of very
brilliant work.

00:30:11.808 --> 00:30:16.123
It's much more likely isn't it
that one of these accounts is

00:30:16.123 --> 00:30:18.390
more accurate than the other.
 

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.380
Which one do you believe?
 

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.839
That's a real question,
which one do you believe?

00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:27.250
Somebody make me an argument.
 

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.480
Decide.
 

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:34.400
Come on break out of that
undergraduate shyness and just

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.099
make an argument.
 

00:30:36.099 --> 00:30:36.828
Yes.
 

00:30:36.828 --> 00:30:38.220
Student: 
&gt;

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.509
Prof: You believe Acts,
why would you believe Acts?

00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:41.618
Say it loud.
 

00:30:41.618 --> 00:30:49.450
Student: 
&gt;

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.307
Prof: Acts sounds like a
historical account,

00:30:51.307 --> 00:30:51.788
doesn't it?
 

00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:53.990
It doesn't seem like it has a
big axe to grind.

00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:56.263
In Galatians,
Paul is--obviously has an axe

00:30:56.263 --> 00:30:56.858
to grind.
 

00:30:56.858 --> 00:30:58.701
He's going all over himself
saying, "I'm not lying,

00:30:58.701 --> 00:30:59.940
I'm not lying,
I'm not lying."

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:02.843
This fellow says,
maybe Paul's protesting too

00:31:02.843 --> 00:31:06.208
much in Galatians and Acts
sounds a bit more like an

00:31:06.208 --> 00:31:07.660
impartial account.
 

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.519
Do the rest of you buy that?
 

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:12.809
Everybody nods their head that
sounds good to everybody?

00:31:12.809 --> 00:31:13.960
Yes sir.
 

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.598
Student: 
&gt;

00:31:17.598 --> 00:31:19.690
Prof: Galatians is a
firsthand account.

00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:22.388
I mean Acts was written by
someone we don't know--even know

00:31:22.388 --> 00:31:24.436
who wrote it,
but it obviously wasn't written

00:31:24.436 --> 00:31:26.019
by someone who saw this stuff.
 

00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:29.194
He says he used other sources,
so when we get to the Gospel of

00:31:29.194 --> 00:31:31.170
Luke and Acts,
which were both written by the

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:32.720
same person,
we'll see that this author

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:34.118
admits that he used other
sources.

00:31:34.118 --> 00:31:37.047
He was not an eyewitness of any
of this stuff,

00:31:37.047 --> 00:31:40.950
at least this stuff that he
tells about here in this part.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.247
There's some debate about
whether he maybe was an

00:31:43.247 --> 00:31:46.118
eyewitness for some of the
travels of Paul later in Acts,

00:31:46.118 --> 00:31:48.328
but at this point he doesn't
even claim to have been there.

00:31:48.328 --> 00:31:51.991
As a historian,
wouldn't you take an account by

00:31:51.991 --> 00:31:54.939
an eyewitness,
the person who actually

00:31:54.939 --> 00:31:59.078
experienced this,
over an account written later?

00:31:59.078 --> 00:32:03.326
This gentleman over here says,
no, Paul's account is better

00:32:03.326 --> 00:32:06.329
historical source because he was
there.

00:32:09.859 --> 00:32:13.640
Anybody else make an argument?
 

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.262
Well what about the idea that
the writer of Acts is just

00:32:17.262 --> 00:32:18.450
telling a story.
 

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:23.509
Paul clearly has an axe to
grind, not to make a pun.

00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:24.920
Yes.
 

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:30.210
Student:  The writer of
Acts &gt;

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:31.180
Prof: That's right.
 

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.382
The writer of Acts could be
having an axe to grind,

00:32:33.382 --> 00:32:35.672
which is to make the church
sound more harmonious and

00:32:35.672 --> 00:32:37.390
united, and all that sort of
thing.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:41.538
It may also be that the writer
of Acts wants to emphasize the

00:32:41.538 --> 00:32:45.440
center of Jerusalem and Judea,
and the leaders there as the

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.450
central authority for the early
Christian movement.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:52.952
And so he's exaggerating Paul's
presence in Jerusalem,

00:32:52.952 --> 00:32:57.880
and exaggerating the role of
these leaders in Jerusalem.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.519
That's a good point.
 

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:02.289
The writer of Acts,
we should all know that every

00:33:02.289 --> 00:33:06.122
written account of anything,
no matter how historically good

00:33:06.122 --> 00:33:08.203
it is,
still has a point of view,

00:33:08.203 --> 00:33:09.460
still has an agenda.
 

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:09.910
Yes.
 

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.180
Student: Was Paul aware
&gt;

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.073
Prof: No,
Acts was written after the life

00:33:15.073 --> 00:33:18.644
of Paul, so Paul doesn't have
access to the Book of Acts as

00:33:18.644 --> 00:33:20.058
one of his sources.
 

00:33:20.058 --> 00:33:23.921
Now the other question is did
the writer of Acts have access

00:33:23.921 --> 00:33:25.230
to Paul's letters?
 

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:29.630
We don't know.
 

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:32.118
The basic--it's time for me to
wrap up here,

00:33:32.118 --> 00:33:37.355
the basic question here is
whether you decide to trust more

00:33:37.355 --> 00:33:42.230
Acts or Paul on this issue is a
historical question.

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.220
But the basic point also is to
get you by a very,

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:49.461
very close reading of this text
to see that it's much a better

00:33:49.461 --> 00:33:53.759
historical practice as a
historian to not text--

00:33:53.759 --> 00:33:57.318
not take any of these texts as
simple straightforward history.

00:33:57.318 --> 00:34:00.724
What I will argue,
eventually, is that Paul is

00:34:00.724 --> 00:34:04.660
probably telling what is more
accurately the case.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.009
Yes, he has a reason to stress
it,

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:09.780
but he says it so forcefully
and he writes it in a letter,

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.280
and if he had actually been in
Jerusalem as much as Acts says,

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.795
couldn't the people who
received his letter have checked

00:34:15.795 --> 00:34:16.300
this out?
 

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.969
Yeah.
 

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:21.773
They could basically say later,
no, Paul, in spite of saying

00:34:21.773 --> 00:34:24.159
that you do not lie,
you're a liar.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:26.920
We know, we've checked it out.
 

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.853
Paul's letter,
I would say,

00:34:28.853 --> 00:34:33.090
is much more likely to contain
better historical evidence,

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:37.329
but we can argue about that
until the cows come home.

00:34:37.329 --> 00:34:40.646
The main point is that you
still have to sift these

00:34:40.646 --> 00:34:44.496
documents with a lot of careful
sifting to get any reliable

00:34:44.496 --> 00:34:46.619
historical data out of them.
 

00:34:46.619 --> 00:34:48.539
For example,
later when we get to Galatians

00:34:48.539 --> 00:34:51.391
for some of these things,
we'll talk a bit about what

00:34:51.391 --> 00:34:54.596
really happened in Antioch that
caused the split between

00:34:54.596 --> 00:34:55.820
Barnabas and Paul.
 

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.411
In Acts it's all like,
oh no they just had a personnel

00:34:59.411 --> 00:35:02.190
disagreement,
but they parted perfectly in

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.699
agreement about the basic
gospel.

00:35:04.699 --> 00:35:08.876
According to Galatians,
no, Barnabas and Paul disagreed

00:35:08.876 --> 00:35:13.516
strongly over whether Jews could
continue in table fellowship

00:35:13.516 --> 00:35:18.003
with uncircumcised Gentiles,
and Barnabas went along with

00:35:18.003 --> 00:35:22.219
Peter and some disciples from
James in Jerusalem in saying,

00:35:22.219 --> 00:35:26.057
no, not even Jewish followers
of Jesus shouldn't share meals

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:28.010
with uncircumcised Gentiles.
 

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:33.000
Paul believes that Barnabas got
that wrong.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.557
So according to Paul's letters,
Paul split with Barnabas on a

00:35:36.557 --> 00:35:39.760
serious disagreement over a
doctrine in practice in the

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.768
early church.
 

00:35:40.768 --> 00:35:44.913
And again, Acts kind of slides
that over because Acts tries to

00:35:44.913 --> 00:35:47.969
make the church look completely
harmonious.

00:35:47.969 --> 00:35:50.289
This is historical criticism.
 

00:35:50.289 --> 00:35:54.800
Reading these texts just like
you would read any other ancient

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:59.237
text with just the same amount
of scrutiny and suspicion that

00:35:59.237 --> 00:36:00.940
you would any text.
 

00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.579
That's what we're going to do
in this semester.

00:36:02.579 --> 00:36:05.110
It's different from reading the
text as scripture.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.306
This is not to say that I
believe reading the text as

00:36:07.306 --> 00:36:08.489
scripture is bad or wrong.
 

00:36:08.489 --> 00:36:10.880
I believe it's just a different
way of reading.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.730
I think you can come up with
good, true,

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.329
Christian theological readings
of the New Testament and you can

00:36:16.329 --> 00:36:19.465
come up with very decent
historical readings of the New

00:36:19.465 --> 00:36:20.280
Testament.
 

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:23.050
They just always won't be the
same kind of reading.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.773
What this class is going to do
for the most part is talk about

00:36:25.773 --> 00:36:28.219
that historical reading,
and when we get to Paul,

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:31.530
when we get to Acts we're going
to pick these texts all apart,

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.510
we're going to ask questions
like, is any of this historical?

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.690
If so what and why?
 

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:40.056
So start thinking that way,
and then I'll see you on

00:36:40.056 --> 00:36:40.849
Wednesday.

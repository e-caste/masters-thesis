00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.255
Prof: Okay,
today we're going to talk a

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:06.190
little bit more about Social
Security.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.052
Social Security,
remember, is the biggest

00:00:09.052 --> 00:00:11.200
program the government runs.
 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.146
Its annual expenditures are
slightly bigger than the

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:17.440
military expenditures every
year, and those two things are

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.520
way bigger than everything else.
 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.417
It's been the biggest program
the government's run since the

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:26.411
New Deal,
since Franklin Delano Roosevelt

00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:29.180
put it into effect in the late
1930s,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.910
and it seems to be broke.
 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.576
So it lasted for 70 years,
and now it seems on the verge

00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:36.710
of going broke.
 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.590
So what happened and how can we
fix it?

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.888
And as I said,
this has been a topic of

00:00:41.888 --> 00:00:44.248
conversation,
presidential conversation,

00:00:44.248 --> 00:00:45.700
at least since 2000.
 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.370
There were a bunch of
commissions before that,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.800
looking at the problem,
and what I said last time was,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.090
the general public and our
politicians seem completely

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.140
confused about what's going on.
 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.003
So we need to figure out,
how could it be that the

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:01.228
program went broke?
 

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:05.120
Should that have been a
surprise, and how can we fix it?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.191
And the three standard things
everybody says is,

00:01:08.191 --> 00:01:11.198
President Bush and many people
like him saying,

00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:13.879
"Well, the system's going
broke.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:17.144
The rate of return young people
like you are going to get is

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:18.750
less than 2 percent a year.
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.860
That's terrible.
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.584
Any bond, any stock,
you can expect a much higher

00:01:22.584 --> 00:01:25.310
return than that,
so the program's just awful.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.080
We should stop it or privatize
it."

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.920
I'll explain what privatizing
means.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.340
In that way,
your money, instead of going to

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.616
old people,
will be put in the stock market

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:38.300
and you'll get a higher rate of
return and you'll do much

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.780
better.
 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.287
Then a second thing people say
is, "Well,

00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:44.860
the thing lasted all this time.
 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.019
I mean, what's really gone
different?

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:49.290
What could possibly have caused
the change?

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.680
It must be those dastardly baby
boom generation-ers,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.453
like me, who are headed towards
retirement in another 20 or 30

00:01:58.453 --> 00:02:00.099
years,
and they're going to bankrupt

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.549
the system.
 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.013
There are going to be so many
of those old geezers hanging

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:05.488
around needing to get paid,
that young people like you

00:02:05.488 --> 00:02:07.120
won't be able to carry the
burden,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.628
and so it's our fault."
 

00:02:08.628 --> 00:02:11.538
And then there are the people,
the naysayers,

00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:14.628
Gore chief among them,
but many others,

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:19.060
Obama now similarly saying,
slightly similar things,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.182
saying, "Well,
privatization doesn't make any

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:21.530
sense.
 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.854
It's logically impossible,
because if you take the taxes

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:27.030
that the young people are
paying,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.590
and tell them,
those Social Security taxes,

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.408
they can invest in private
accounts,

00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:34.050
the stock market,
with their own name on it,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.008
then how are we going to give
money to the old people now?

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:38.819
So you'll just be screwing the
old generation."

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.788
So privatization is impossible.
 

00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:43.479
So those are the three most
standard things people say.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.690
All three of them have some
truth to them,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.930
but on the whole,
they're substantially wrong,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.324
completely wrong,
and once we clarify what stage

00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:54.925
the system is in,
we'll be able to think about

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:56.080
what the right solution is.
 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.895
I'm going to tell you my
solution which,

00:02:58.895 --> 00:03:03.157
as I said, is not universally
admired, but I'll see what you

00:03:03.157 --> 00:03:04.530
think about it.
 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.149
So the program came into effect
in what was the greatest or the

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:14.408
biggest of the New Deal advances
made by FDR.

00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:19.574
And I just thought I'd play you
this tape of him signing it into

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:22.141
law,
and behind him is the Secretary

00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:23.870
of Labor,
Frances Perkins,

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.996
who you'll see in a second,
played a huge role in this,

00:03:26.996 --> 00:03:29.169
since she was the first woman
in the Cabinet.

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.727
And by the way,
in my generation,

00:03:31.727 --> 00:03:36.202
there are many women named
Frances, because their parents

00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:38.199
named them after her.
 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:43.120
So here's the--let's see if
this works.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:54.288
&gt;
 

00:03:54.288 --> 00:03:58.163
Franklin D. Roosevelt:
Today a hope of many years'

00:03:58.163 --> 00:04:00.930
standing is in large part
fulfilled.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.951
The civilization of the past
hundred years,

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:10.411
with its startling industrial
changes, has tended more and

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:13.378
more to make life insecure.
 

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:17.706
Young people have come to
wonder what would be their lot

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:19.910
when they came to old age.
 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.860
The man with a job has wondered
how long the job would last.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.649
This Social Security measure
gives at least some protection

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:37.038
to thirty millions of our
citizens who will reap direct

00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:41.829
benefits through unemployment
compensation,

00:04:41.829 --> 00:04:46.764
through old-age pensions and
through increased services for

00:04:46.764 --> 00:04:52.040
the protection of children and
the prevention of ill health.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.382
We can never insure one hundred
percent of the population

00:04:56.382 --> 00:05:01.113
against one hundred percent of
the hazards and vicissitudes of

00:05:01.113 --> 00:05:04.401
life,
but we have tried to frame a

00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:09.785
law which will give some measure
of protection to the average

00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:14.629
citizen and to his family
against the loss of a job and

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:17.860
against poverty-ridden old age.
 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.939
It seems to me that if the
Senate and the House of

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.685
Representatives in this long and
arduous session have done

00:05:26.685 --> 00:05:30.600
nothing more than pass this
security bill,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.137
Social Security Act,
the session would be regarded

00:05:35.137 --> 00:05:37.639
as historic for all time.
 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.620
&gt;
 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.550
Prof: Okay,
well, it was regarded as

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.511
historic for all time,
and let me now explain what

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:49.399
Social Security does,
and what the rules are.

00:05:49.399 --> 00:06:06.889
And I have to open another file.
 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.675
I forgot where I put--I hope
it's--I wonder whether

00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:14.160
it's--sorry, I opened the wrong
year, I see.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:21.560
I'm living in the past.
 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.560
Sorry, that was last year's.
 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:47.750
 
 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:55.310
Okay, so we went through all
this last time.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.709
So, after passing legislation,
a massive publicity campaign

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:03.045
was launched,
convincing people that this was

00:07:03.045 --> 00:07:04.259
a good idea.
 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:06.283
And not everybody thought it
was such a good idea,

00:07:06.283 --> 00:07:06.819
by the way.
 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:09.689
And so, you know,
this is an example of the

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.970
advertisements that were
plastered everybody,

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.259
you know, telling you about how
much you were going to get,

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.379
money after you retired.
 

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:20.589
Now what was the idea of Social
Security?

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:23.444
The idea was that lots of
people, when they were young,

00:07:23.444 --> 00:07:26.192
didn't really have the
foresight to imagine what life

00:07:26.192 --> 00:07:28.519
was going to be like when they
were old.

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:32.485
In fact, in the late 1930s,
the most destitute of Americans

00:07:32.485 --> 00:07:35.483
were the old,
and so the idea was to force

00:07:35.483 --> 00:07:37.930
them to save when they were
young,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.148
and then the money would be
there--would be invested in US

00:07:41.148 --> 00:07:43.519
Treasury bonds and accumulate
interest,

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:46.000
and the money would be there
when they got old.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.279
So it was imagined to be a
prefunded system,

00:07:49.279 --> 00:07:52.661
prefunded meaning the money
comes in and it's that money

00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:56.041
which is going to then pay
people later when they get to

00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:56.779
old age.
 

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.954
And the idea was,
you were going to collect

00:07:58.954 --> 00:08:01.389
enough taxes so that when you
got to be old,

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:04.300
you would get 40 percent--every
year,

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.769
you would be receiving,
the average person,

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:09.786
recipient, retiree,
would be receiving 40 percent

00:08:09.786 --> 00:08:12.930
of the average wage of the
average young worker.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.672
And, you know,
the idea is that when you're

00:08:14.672 --> 00:08:16.000
older, you have less expenses.
 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.007
You probably already own your
house, your children are out of

00:08:20.007 --> 00:08:24.149
the house, so 40 percent should
be enough to keep you going.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:26.947
It was certainly more than the
average old person had at the

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:27.278
time.
 

00:08:27.278 --> 00:08:31.233
Now this you would get for your
entire life, so when Roosevelt

00:08:31.233 --> 00:08:34.344
called it insurance,
what was the main thing that

00:08:34.344 --> 00:08:35.769
you were insuring?
 

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:39.879
Well, there's a side part of
the program which he mentioned,

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:42.667
which is insuring people of
disabilities,

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:44.129
things like that.
 

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:49.578
But that's a 1--out of the 12.4
percent tax, it's something like

00:08:49.578 --> 00:08:50.788
1.8 percent.
 

00:08:50.788 --> 00:08:55.143
But the main part of the
program is insurance against

00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:55.730
what?
 

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.490
Yes?
 

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:57.210
Student: Living too long.
 

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.178
Prof: Living too long.
 

00:08:58.178 --> 00:09:01.158
So you get the money your
entire life, no matter how long

00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:04.350
you live, so you're being
insured against living too long.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.500
Exactly.
 

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.179
So what happened was,
of course in the first year,

00:09:09.179 --> 00:09:12.558
a lot of people were starting
to pay taxes.

00:09:12.558 --> 00:09:15.350
And in the second year,
they were paying more taxes,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.066
and of course,
they were still not retired

00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:18.663
yet,
so they weren't actually giving

00:09:18.663 --> 00:09:21.977
out the money to anybody,
and this fund was starting to

00:09:21.977 --> 00:09:22.879
accumulate.
 

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:25.653
So Frances Perkins said,
"Well, what are we doing

00:09:25.653 --> 00:09:26.019
here?
 

00:09:26.019 --> 00:09:28.504
The whole point is that we've
got all these old people,

00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:29.009
you know.
 

00:09:29.009 --> 00:09:30.058
It's just the Depression.
 

00:09:30.058 --> 00:09:32.268
We haven't come out of the
Depression yet."--World War

00:09:32.268 --> 00:09:33.029
II hasn't started.
 

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:35.335
It won't, for the US,
start for a few more years,

00:09:35.335 --> 00:09:35.960
by the way.
 

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.120
"So there are all these
old people sitting here,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.918
totally destitute,
and we've got all this money

00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:43.558
also just sitting here.
 

00:09:43.558 --> 00:09:45.610
It really doesn't make
sense,"

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.470
she said.
 

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.633
"What we ought to do is
take the money the young people

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:52.743
are paying in and give it to the
old people who are already

00:09:52.743 --> 00:09:53.279
there.
 

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:56.407
That way we are going to be
saving these old people and the

00:09:56.407 --> 00:09:58.285
young people,
when they get old,

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:01.423
they'll be saved themselves,
because there'll be more young

00:10:01.423 --> 00:10:04.072
people coming along afterwards
who can pay taxes in when

00:10:04.072 --> 00:10:05.893
they're young,
and today's young,

00:10:05.893 --> 00:10:08.190
when they're old,
will then collect those taxes.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:12.125
They'll be reimbursed for what
they contributed when they were

00:10:12.125 --> 00:10:13.028
young."
 

00:10:13.028 --> 00:10:17.889
Well, so Roosevelt resisted for
a while.

00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:21.320
Frances Perkins was apparently,
incredibly persuasive person.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:25.596
One person at the time named
Witt, who was on the Social

00:10:25.596 --> 00:10:29.173
Security commission,
tried to tell her that was

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:32.048
going to lead to budget
problems.

00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:36.458
She said that he was a
half-Witt, and that we had a

00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:38.399
more urgent problem.
 

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.822
Not that she doubted him,
but the problem was more

00:10:40.822 --> 00:10:43.642
urgent, and so that was the only
way to solve the problem,

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:44.779
the current crisis.
 

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:48.383
So they finally agreed to move
the system from a prefunded

00:10:48.383 --> 00:10:50.658
system, to a pay as you go
system.

00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:53.692
So the money coming in from
current workers is used to pay

00:10:53.692 --> 00:10:55.288
directly to the old workers.
 

00:10:55.288 --> 00:10:59.581
So I don't want to get into all
these little variations that got

00:10:59.581 --> 00:11:00.058
made.
 

00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:04.336
So the program's called the Old
Age Survivors and Disability

00:11:04.336 --> 00:11:05.570
Insurance Plan.
 

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.308
The insurance is mainly for
living too long,

00:11:08.308 --> 00:11:11.563
but also in case you get
disabled, or in case you have

00:11:11.563 --> 00:11:15.620
children and you're disabled,
you die, they get something.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:18.618
Okay, so it's a combination of
insurance, disability,

00:11:18.618 --> 00:11:21.558
but the main insurance is for
living a long time.

00:11:21.558 --> 00:11:25.908
So as I said,
the tax now is 12.4 percent,

00:11:25.908 --> 00:11:29.408
up to a cap of 106,800 dollars.
 

00:11:29.408 --> 00:11:32.596
So if you make more than
106,800 dollars,

00:11:32.596 --> 00:11:35.624
you pay, you know,
13,000 or something,

00:11:35.624 --> 00:11:39.210
and then nothing more on Social
Security.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.908
Okay, so the Social Security
tax stops at 106,800.

00:11:42.908 --> 00:11:46.509
So the income tax,
I'm losing track of what it is,

00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:48.860
and whether we're going to go
back to the old one,

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.500
but let's say it was 38
percent, 39 percent,

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.399
something like that,
if you had to pay that income

00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:58.190
tax and on top of it pay Social
Security tax of 12.4 percent,

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:00.259
you'd be over 50 percent taxed.
 

00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:04.028
So needless to say,
some of the people who think we

00:12:04.028 --> 00:12:08.477
can solve our Social Security
problem by eliminating the cap

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:12.774
would be imposing a gigantic
marginal tax rate on a lot of

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:16.470
people who don't have a marginal
tax rate--

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.308
who have already high marginal
tax rate.

00:12:18.308 --> 00:12:21.490
That would make it sky high,
so that's been resisted.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.570
So 94 percent of workers are
below the cap anyway,

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.450
so we're talking about the top
6 percent,

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:29.668
most of which--you'll be in
that top 6 percent,

00:12:29.668 --> 00:12:34.690
so you won't have to pay on the
margin Social Security tax.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:36.960
So there's the taxes,
12.4 percent,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.230
and then there are the
benefits.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.759
Now how do the benefits work?
 

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:41.870
How are they determined?
 

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.230
So the tax, as I said,
you just take your income below

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:49.440
106,000 and you pay 12.4 percent
tax.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.610
So how do the benefits work?
 

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.303
This is a little bit
complicated, but it's actually a

00:12:55.303 --> 00:12:57.009
very interesting plan.
 

00:12:57.009 --> 00:13:00.850
What they do is they look at
your entire lifetime earnings.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.100
You're not going to get
benefits till after you retire,

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.658
so you've got your whole life
history behind you,

00:13:05.658 --> 00:13:08.570
and they say,
"Let's look at,

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:13.001
every year, what the fraction
of your wage was relative to the

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.110
economy wide average."
 

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:16.639
So it's your relative earning.
 

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:20.912
So when you're young,
it's probably going to be .8,

00:13:20.912 --> 00:13:21.340
.9.
 

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.184
If you go to Yale,
it's probably going to be

00:13:24.184 --> 00:13:26.302
1.5,2, you know,
soon thereafter,

00:13:26.302 --> 00:13:27.230
all right?
 

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:29.789
Okay, and it might get even
higher, but anyway,

00:13:29.789 --> 00:13:32.740
so that's the relative earning
you have every year.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.804
So then they say,
"Let's average your 35

00:13:35.804 --> 00:13:40.124
best relative earning years and
just take the sum and divide by

00:13:40.124 --> 00:13:41.029
35."
 

00:13:41.029 --> 00:13:44.491
So what is your average
lifetime relative wage,

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.320
you know?
 

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.139
For the average person,
it's going to be 1.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:48.984
For some people,
it might be .8,

00:13:48.984 --> 00:13:51.423
for some people,
it might be 2 or 3 or 10,

00:13:51.423 --> 00:13:51.960
okay.
 

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.770
Now the first--all right,
so you've got your average

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.149
relative lifetime wage.
 

00:13:56.149 --> 00:13:57.798
What do you make when you
retire?

00:13:57.798 --> 00:14:01.496
Well, when you hit an age,
which, you know,

00:14:01.496 --> 00:14:05.283
they're adjusting now,
but it used to be 65,

00:14:05.283 --> 00:14:08.804
when you hit 65,
they compute the average

00:14:08.804 --> 00:14:10.389
wage--sorry.
 

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:13.509
When you hit 65,
you're going to be paid a

00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:18.149
fraction of the average wage in
the economy when you're 65.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:21.590
So what is the fraction that
you're paid?

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:25.428
Well, that depends on what your
historical average wage was.

00:14:25.428 --> 00:14:28.350
So let's just see what the
function is.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:33.092
So, if your average wage was 1,
equal to the average wage of

00:14:33.092 --> 00:14:35.124
the economy,
your entire,

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.490
over those 35 years,
so you're the average guy,

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.220
then you get,
you see, that's near .4.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:46.192
It's actually .44,
so you get 44 percent of the

00:14:46.192 --> 00:14:50.950
average wage at the time you
retire, okay?

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:56.720
If on the other hand,
you made 10 percent of the--

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.618
your relative wage historically
was 10 percent of the average

00:14:59.618 --> 00:15:02.846
wage in the economy,
you would get 9 percent of the

00:15:02.846 --> 00:15:05.460
average wage at the time you
retire.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:07.850
So you can see that this is
what's called a concave

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.625
function, just like our utility
function, those diminishing

00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:11.629
marginal returns.
 

00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:15.397
So it means that if you're
earning very little through your

00:15:15.397 --> 00:15:18.450
life, you're going to get a much
better deal.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.740
You're going to be paid--the
ratio of relative wage

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:25.888
historically to what you get of
the young people's wage is going

00:15:25.888 --> 00:15:28.899
to be .9,
then the slope drops to .32,

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:32.408
then it drops to .15 and after
you're double--

00:15:32.408 --> 00:15:35.832
it's actually,
I think, 1.99--after you're

00:15:35.832 --> 00:15:39.979
double the average--
if your historical average wage

00:15:39.979 --> 00:15:44.450
was more than twice the average
wage in the whole economy,

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:45.840
it doesn't do you any good.
 

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.100
Might as well have been twice.
 

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.619
If it's 4 times,
10 times, you don't get any

00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:51.519
increase.
 

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:55.375
Okay, so you can see why it
makes some sense to have a cap

00:15:55.375 --> 00:15:58.801
to the taxation,
because people who are making

00:15:58.801 --> 00:16:02.480
10 times the average wage,
you know, let's say they're

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.629
making a million dollars
nowadays,

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:08.101
they aren't going to see any
benefit from having contributed

00:16:08.101 --> 00:16:09.808
so much to Social Security.
 

00:16:09.808 --> 00:16:15.905
Their benefits would be just
the same as if they only made

00:16:15.905 --> 00:16:18.580
200,000 dollars a year.
 

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.065
Okay, so anyway,
you see that there's a

00:16:21.065 --> 00:16:24.990
connection between how much you
made when you were young,

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:26.980
how much you get paid when
you're old,

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.049
but the connection is a concave
thing.

00:16:29.049 --> 00:16:31.168
So it redistributes income.
 

00:16:31.168 --> 00:16:34.873
People who had very low average
wages when they were working get

00:16:34.873 --> 00:16:37.988
a better deal from Social
Security than people who had

00:16:37.988 --> 00:16:40.808
high relative wages while they
were working.

00:16:40.808 --> 00:16:43.730
And that's a cornerstone of the
idea.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:49.480
It's meant to help protect the
people who are very poor.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.700
And so it doesn't pay everybody
equally.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:57.038
Still, you get some return from
having contributed more,

00:16:57.038 --> 00:16:59.620
but definitely you don't get a
completely fair return,

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.759
because the whole idea is to
redistribute wealth and help the

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:03.649
least well off.
 

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:07.088
Okay, so that's one of the
cornerstones of Social Security.

00:17:07.088 --> 00:17:12.569
All right, going back,
now what happens to you after

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.578
the first year you retire?
 

00:17:15.578 --> 00:17:17.861
After the first year you
retire, so when you're 65,

00:17:17.861 --> 00:17:19.914
you're getting 40 percent of
the average wage,

00:17:19.914 --> 00:17:22.380
if you're the average worker
throughout your life.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:24.470
You know, it's 44 percent,
something like that.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.776
After that, your Social
Security benefit is indexed to

00:17:28.776 --> 00:17:32.838
inflation, so it grows at the
rate of inflation.

00:17:32.838 --> 00:17:34.928
The wage is probably growing
faster than the rate of

00:17:34.928 --> 00:17:35.420
inflation.
 

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:41.586
So as you get to be 75,80 and
85, your average benefit is down

00:17:41.586 --> 00:17:47.550
to 36 percent of the average
wage of the workers when you're

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.546
85,
but it starts off at 44

00:17:49.546 --> 00:17:52.230
percent, assuming you were
average your whole life.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.218
It'll be 44 percent and
gradually decline if wages grow

00:17:56.218 --> 00:17:57.769
faster than prices.
 

00:17:57.769 --> 00:18:02.207
So it's insuring you against
living long, because the benefit

00:18:02.207 --> 00:18:03.759
carries on forever.
 

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:06.516
It's insuring you against
inflation, because it's

00:18:06.516 --> 00:18:07.778
inflation corrected.
 

00:18:07.778 --> 00:18:12.087
It's in a way insuring you
against feeling like a loser,

00:18:12.087 --> 00:18:16.943
because you're always going to
start off with a fraction of the

00:18:16.943 --> 00:18:18.588
new average wage.
 

00:18:18.588 --> 00:18:21.294
So if your children,
if the whole country grows

00:18:21.294 --> 00:18:24.528
incredibly fast and your
children are incredibly wealthy

00:18:24.528 --> 00:18:28.115
and getting high average wages
and every young person's making

00:18:28.115 --> 00:18:30.516
a lot,
the old won't feel totally left

00:18:30.516 --> 00:18:30.778
out.
 

00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:34.029
They'll be keeping up with
them, 40 percent of them anyway,

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:36.618
and similarly,
if the young have a horrible

00:18:36.618 --> 00:18:39.210
time and aren't making very much
money,

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.910
the benefits to the old also go
way down,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.700
because they're getting 44
percent of a much lower number.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.083
So it's every generation in it
together and redistributing

00:18:49.083 --> 00:18:52.390
wealth from the richer to the
less rich,

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:56.993
protecting you against long
life, making sure that you have

00:18:56.993 --> 00:19:00.250
some money no matter how long
you live.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:01.480
That's the idea of the system.
 

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.761
So are there any questions
about how this mechanically

00:19:06.761 --> 00:19:07.559
works?
 

00:19:07.559 --> 00:19:17.328
Okay.
 

00:19:17.328 --> 00:19:19.617
Now it's very hard to do this
in the market,

00:19:19.617 --> 00:19:20.308
by the way.
 

00:19:20.308 --> 00:19:22.920
If you wanted to,
for example now,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.636
think to yourself,
"Oh, I'd like to protect

00:19:26.636 --> 00:19:29.009
myself against my old age.
 

00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:32.016
I'm three years out of Yale and
I've fallen into an incredible

00:19:32.016 --> 00:19:33.890
job that's paying me a huge
fortune.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.368
I might want to retire early
and be a writer the rest of my

00:19:37.368 --> 00:19:38.150
life."
 

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:43.595
You can't easily find an
annuity in the private market

00:19:43.595 --> 00:19:48.630
that's going to tell you that
when you hit 65,

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.710
it will continue paying you for
the rest of your life.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.115
You can actually find them,
but they're incredibly bad

00:19:54.115 --> 00:19:54.630
deals.
 

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:58.894
The reason that they're bad
deals is that the people who

00:19:58.894 --> 00:20:03.548
would have to take the money now
and give it back to you when

00:20:03.548 --> 00:20:06.000
you're old,
first of all you have to worry

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.340
whether they're going to be
around and still be able to pay

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.308
you when you get old.
 

00:20:09.308 --> 00:20:12.096
And secondly,
they're worried that the only

00:20:12.096 --> 00:20:15.880
people who come to them are
people whose families live 100

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.898
years,
and so they're going to have to

00:20:17.898 --> 00:20:20.269
pay a lot longer than they would
for the average person.

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:22.540
So they're afraid of getting a
bad selection,

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.586
that is, a selection of super
healthy people wanting to make

00:20:25.586 --> 00:20:26.308
that deal.
 

00:20:26.308 --> 00:20:29.305
And so they basically assume
that you're going to live to 100

00:20:29.305 --> 00:20:32.298
and so they're giving you a very
low annuity year by year.

00:20:32.298 --> 00:20:36.787
So Social Security is doing
something that's very hard to

00:20:36.787 --> 00:20:38.630
obtain in the market.
 

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:45.170
Now, so what went wrong?
 

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.970
Oh, I should say a couple other
things about it,

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.519
some interesting things.
 

00:20:49.519 --> 00:20:52.019
You can choose to retire early
if you want.

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:54.981
If you retire before 65 and you
want to get your payments

00:20:54.981 --> 00:20:56.965
starting earlier,
they say, "Okay,

00:20:56.965 --> 00:20:58.942
you can do that,
but we're going to cut the

00:20:58.942 --> 00:21:01.402
payments every year,"
and they make some actuarial

00:21:01.402 --> 00:21:04.635
calculation so that it's fair,
based on how long the average

00:21:04.635 --> 00:21:05.450
person lives.
 

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.858
So if you start at 63,
you get 2 extra years,

00:21:07.858 --> 00:21:10.308
but they know if you live the
average amount of time,

00:21:10.308 --> 00:21:12.750
how much to cut it down,
so that on average,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:15.335
you'll get the same amount as
if you did the normal thing

00:21:15.335 --> 00:21:16.118
retiring at 65.
 

00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:18.680
They've actually raised this
age to 67.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.660
Now another thing is the
spousal benefit.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:25.670
This is actually quite amusing,
I think.

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:31.819
So I had a secretary 20 years
ago who got married three times.

00:21:31.819 --> 00:21:35.048
So she consulted me about this.
 

00:21:35.048 --> 00:21:37.729
If you're a spouse,
you know, traditionally,

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:41.220
one of the spouses wouldn't
work, typically the woman.

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:48.000
And so the wife has the right
to 50 percent of her husband's--

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.767
or the husband has the
right--one spouse has a right to

00:21:50.767 --> 00:21:53.328
50 percent of the benefits of
the other spouse,

00:21:53.328 --> 00:21:56.670
just by virtue of being married
or having been married.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.054
So the rule is that if you've
been married for more than 10

00:22:00.054 --> 00:22:01.763
years,
then you can either take your

00:22:01.763 --> 00:22:04.123
own Social Security benefits,
or if they're bigger,

00:22:04.123 --> 00:22:06.308
you can take 50 percent of your
spouse's.

00:22:06.308 --> 00:22:09.088
And if you've been married to
several different guys,

00:22:09.088 --> 00:22:13.068
say, and you're not married to
any of them anymore,

00:22:13.068 --> 00:22:16.208
you can pick the guy who had
the highest income and get 50

00:22:16.208 --> 00:22:17.088
percent of it.
 

00:22:17.088 --> 00:22:22.532
So she tracked down her first
husband she hadn't talked to in

00:22:22.532 --> 00:22:24.618
30 years, and anyway.
 

00:22:24.618 --> 00:22:30.568
So okay, and there are a bunch
of other rules.

00:22:30.568 --> 00:22:33.538
Anyway, that's not really the
heart of the matter.

00:22:33.538 --> 00:22:37.385
The heart of the matter
is--just to give you an idea of

00:22:37.385 --> 00:22:38.170
the size.
 

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.788
This was in 2005.
 

00:22:39.788 --> 00:22:44.150
So 157 million workers are
paying into it.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:48.509
There are 48 million
beneficiaries.

00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:50.108
It's a gigantic program.
 

00:22:50.108 --> 00:22:54.489
So imagine the cost of keeping
track of just who's alive,

00:22:54.489 --> 00:22:55.348
you know.
 

00:22:55.348 --> 00:22:57.654
When somebody dies,
they're supposed to stop

00:22:57.654 --> 00:22:59.210
collecting Social Security.
 

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.980
How do they know that the guy's
died?

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.940
I mean, that by itself is not
an easy thing to keep track of.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:05.650
They have to send the checks to
everybody.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.632
Somebody moves,
they have to figure out where

00:23:07.632 --> 00:23:09.390
to send the check to the new
address.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.313
They have to get the taxes,
they have to make sure people

00:23:12.313 --> 00:23:13.880
are paying the right amount.
 

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:19.380
It's a huge thing involving
basically the entire population,

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.818
a couple hundred million people
almost,

00:23:20.818 --> 00:23:24.395
either getting taxes,
paying taxes or receiving

00:23:24.395 --> 00:23:26.598
benefits,
you know, over 200 million

00:23:26.598 --> 00:23:26.990
people.
 

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.343
It's an incredible amount of
paperwork and moving stuff

00:23:30.343 --> 00:23:32.329
around and figuring stuff out.
 

00:23:32.329 --> 00:23:36.068
So how much does it cost?
 

00:23:36.068 --> 00:23:38.210
How much money do they waste
running the whole thing?

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:42.140
Less than 1 percent of the
benefits.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.933
Okay, so it's one of the most
efficiently run programs,

00:23:46.933 --> 00:23:51.993
maybe the most efficiently run
program government has ever

00:23:51.993 --> 00:23:53.058
devised.
 

00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:55.769
So it isn't that the thing is
going broke,

00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:58.318
as you might believe listening
to George Bush,

00:23:58.318 --> 00:24:01.914
because somehow they're pissing
away the money and just losing

00:24:01.914 --> 00:24:02.210
it.
 

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.019
That's not the reason.
 

00:24:04.019 --> 00:24:07.815
Something else is happening,
because they don't waste much

00:24:07.815 --> 00:24:09.680
money running the program.
 

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.920
Okay, this gives you an idea
just of the size of it.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.050
So this is 2005,
so you have to add 20 percent

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:17.068
or something or 15 percent.
 

00:24:17.068 --> 00:24:20.392
So the benefits,
the contributions,

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:21.759
593 billion.
 

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:25.190
Remember, there's a tax rule of
12.4 percent.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:27.696
Then you have to pay out the
benefits, which is some other

00:24:27.696 --> 00:24:29.720
rule, depending on what you
earned in the past,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.700
so there's no connection
between the two.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.295
And in fact,
the contributions are bigger

00:24:34.295 --> 00:24:37.538
than the benefits,
so the trust fund is growing.

00:24:37.538 --> 00:24:40.920
Now look at the administrative
expenses, tiny.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.868
And there are some,
the railroad,

00:24:42.868 --> 00:24:46.106
when the law was first passed,
railroads were in trouble,

00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:48.420
so in order to get some senator
to vote for it,

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.038
they had to hand money over to
the railroad.

00:24:50.038 --> 00:24:51.749
So anything,
something's going on with the

00:24:51.749 --> 00:24:52.250
railroads.
 

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:56.613
But the other benefit is the
trust fund makes returns,

00:24:56.613 --> 00:25:00.400
because it's a 2 trillion
dollar trust fund.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.666
It was a little smaller than
that 2005, so it's earning

00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:03.130
interest.
 

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.990
That's part of the extra
returns.

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:07.973
You see why the surplus is
quite big now,

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:10.660
but it's headed to be quite
small.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:15.548
Okay, so now what is the
argument about?

00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:18.019
What is the crisis of Social
Security?

00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:20.940
What do the Democrats and the
Republicans say?

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.828
Well, you've just heard what
the program is.

00:25:22.828 --> 00:25:25.714
How attractive do you think it
is, and do you really think it's

00:25:25.714 --> 00:25:26.740
such a good program?
 

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:30.380
So the main thing is,
it's going broke.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.259
Okay, so now why is it going
broke?

00:25:32.259 --> 00:25:33.240
It's not broke now.
 

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.170
It's making more money than
it's paying out.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.383
But in the future,
it's very obvious,

00:25:37.383 --> 00:25:39.720
you can just look at the
demography.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.338
It's very obvious that it's
going to--

00:25:42.338 --> 00:25:46.073
the benefit formula is so big,
and there are going to be so

00:25:46.073 --> 00:25:50.000
many people retired that the
payments you make to the old,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.113
when I'm retired,
are going to be way bigger than

00:25:52.113 --> 00:25:54.358
the payments that the young are
making in taxes,

00:25:54.358 --> 00:25:56.140
provided the rules stay the
same.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.130
So that's the main problem.
 

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.482
Somehow the system got out of
whack and we have to figure out

00:26:02.482 --> 00:26:04.660
how to put it back together.
 

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:07.700
Now it's no surprise in one
sense that there's an imbalance,

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.740
because there's nothing about
the rules that balanced it.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.640
I mean, the taxes you
pay--we'll look at this in a

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.538
second--that's just some
formula, 12.4 percent.

00:26:16.538 --> 00:26:20.038
What's that got to do with the
benefits you're paying?

00:26:20.038 --> 00:26:23.732
Well, the benefits are 40
percent, on average of what

00:26:23.732 --> 00:26:25.578
young people are making.
 

00:26:25.578 --> 00:26:27.990
So basically,
somehow the system must have

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:31.461
assumed that there would be
three young people for every old

00:26:31.461 --> 00:26:32.108
person.
 

00:26:32.108 --> 00:26:35.193
So the young people paying 12
percent each,

00:26:35.193 --> 00:26:39.160
the old guy getting 40 percent,
you know, 3 times 12.4,

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.288
it's close to 40 percent.
 

00:26:41.288 --> 00:26:44.397
So if the ratio of young to
old, young workers to old

00:26:44.397 --> 00:26:48.045
retirees getting benefits is 3
to 1, then the systems going to

00:26:48.045 --> 00:26:49.598
sort of be in balance.
 

00:26:49.598 --> 00:26:52.338
But if that ratio is very
different from that,

00:26:52.338 --> 00:26:54.811
the system--for example,
two young people for every old

00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:56.663
person--
the system's going to be way

00:26:56.663 --> 00:26:57.460
out of balance.
 

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.381
And the formula has nothing to
do with how many children people

00:27:00.381 --> 00:27:02.028
are having or anything like
that.

00:27:02.028 --> 00:27:06.769
So it's not so surprising it's
gotten out of balance.

00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:08.594
But we're going to see,
there's a much more fundamental

00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:09.710
reason why it's out of balance.
 

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:12.645
Okay, so the first problem is,
it's not in balance,

00:27:12.645 --> 00:27:14.759
but there are many other
problems.

00:27:14.759 --> 00:27:17.108
So why do Democrats like it so
much?

00:27:17.108 --> 00:27:19.440
Democrats say,
"Oh, it's wonderful.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.858
We're helping poor people.
 

00:27:20.858 --> 00:27:24.400
We're redistributing things on
the basis of lifetime earnings.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.759
We're sharing risks between
generations.

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:27.838
We're all in this
together."

00:27:27.838 --> 00:27:30.441
As I said, if the young people
have bad wages,

00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:32.348
then the old get less benefits.
 

00:27:32.348 --> 00:27:35.038
If the young are booming along,
making huge wages,

00:27:35.038 --> 00:27:39.279
then the old guys keep up with
them,

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:42.180
so there's less--so it's not
only insurance,

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.108
but it's less jealousy and less
disparity in the population.

00:27:46.108 --> 00:27:49.098
And then you're protected
against long life,

00:27:49.098 --> 00:27:52.308
you're protected against
inflation,

00:27:52.308 --> 00:27:55.058
and you can't blunder away your
money,

00:27:55.058 --> 00:27:57.383
because you have no choice
about where your investment

00:27:57.383 --> 00:27:57.690
goes.
 

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.438
The government's taken care of
it, so if you're a bad investor,

00:28:00.438 --> 00:28:03.009
you can't suddenly find that
you've lost all your money.

00:28:03.009 --> 00:28:08.308
So now what do Republicans say?
 

00:28:08.308 --> 00:28:11.733
And surprisingly--well,
anyway, you'll be surprised

00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:14.200
where I come out on this,
I think.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:18.307
So Republicans say,
"This stuff is much less

00:28:18.307 --> 00:28:21.558
good than it sounds at first
glance.

00:28:21.558 --> 00:28:23.920
For one thing,
there are no property rights.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.759
I mean, who's to say what I'm
going to get when I'm old?

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:29.230
Nobody even knows what they're
going to get when they're old.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.088
I defy you,"
a Republican would say,

00:28:31.088 --> 00:28:33.430
"to tell me exactly what
your benefits are going to be,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.130
or even to explain to me how
they're calculated."

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:38.490
"Virtually nobody in the
population can do that.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.673
That's just not right,
and you have no control over

00:28:41.673 --> 00:28:42.119
them.
 

00:28:42.119 --> 00:28:43.109
So what's going to happen?"
 

00:28:43.109 --> 00:28:44.058
a Republican would say.
 

00:28:44.058 --> 00:28:46.557
"One of these days,
the Democrats are going to say,

00:28:46.557 --> 00:28:47.740
'Oh, the system's broke.
 

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.075
We can't afford to pay
everything, so we're going to

00:28:50.075 --> 00:28:52.410
cut all the benefits in half' or
something."

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.209
So a Republican would say,
"You know,

00:28:54.209 --> 00:28:55.568
they're not even my benefits.
 

00:28:55.568 --> 00:28:58.825
In order for me to really feel
good about participating in

00:28:58.825 --> 00:29:01.323
Social Security,
I want to know that when I put

00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:03.592
the money in,
what I'm getting out,

00:29:03.592 --> 00:29:05.230
and I want to own it.
 

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:07.845
I don't want it to be some
vague promise that can be taken

00:29:07.845 --> 00:29:09.864
away from me,
and probably will be taken away

00:29:09.864 --> 00:29:10.690
from me."
 

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.627
Okay, so it's a matter of
property rights and

00:29:13.627 --> 00:29:14.630
transparency.
 

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:18.865
Then another thing is,
even if you did know this

00:29:18.865 --> 00:29:23.422
formula that I just explained,
people who want to retire and

00:29:23.422 --> 00:29:26.369
want to figure out how to plan
for their retirement,

00:29:26.369 --> 00:29:28.019
what does a normal person do?
 

00:29:28.019 --> 00:29:30.119
He says, "How much money
have I got in the bank?

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:33.522
I've saved on my work;
I've got 100,000 dollars in the

00:29:33.522 --> 00:29:33.890
bank.
 

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.902
Please tell me what the value
today is of my future Social

00:29:36.902 --> 00:29:37.960
Security benefits.
 

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:43.078
If those are 8 million dollars,
then I know that my 100,000

00:29:43.078 --> 00:29:45.395
dollars,
I don't want to waste too much

00:29:45.395 --> 00:29:47.730
time trying to accumulate money
out of my savings,

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.038
because I'll never catch up to
8 million dollars.

00:29:50.038 --> 00:29:52.707
If it's 50,000 dollars,
today's market value of my

00:29:52.707 --> 00:29:55.809
future Social Security benefits,
I know that I'd better be

00:29:55.809 --> 00:29:57.769
putting in a lot of money today.
 

00:29:57.769 --> 00:30:01.730
And I know how much money today
is, how big my savings are,

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:05.622
relative to what the market
value is of my Social Security

00:30:05.622 --> 00:30:06.920
benefits."
 

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.500
So the Republicans say people
just don't have any idea what

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.453
the value of their benefits are,
even if they happen to know the

00:30:12.453 --> 00:30:15.843
formula I just explained,
nobody really can calculate

00:30:15.843 --> 00:30:16.808
what it is.
 

00:30:16.808 --> 00:30:20.404
Then thirdly,
the rich are giving money to

00:30:20.404 --> 00:30:21.368
the poor.
 

00:30:21.368 --> 00:30:23.240
Everybody knows Social Security
is doing that.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.519
Can you tell me,
what's the effective tax rate?

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:29.308
Let's say I'm in the top tax
bracket.

00:30:29.308 --> 00:30:32.548
What is my effective tax rate
on Social Security?

00:30:32.548 --> 00:30:36.295
What fraction of my taxes are
being taken away from me because

00:30:36.295 --> 00:30:40.102
my benefits are going to be less
good, because I was one of the

00:30:40.102 --> 00:30:41.328
highest earners?
 

00:30:41.328 --> 00:30:44.538
There's virtually no one in the
country who's able to answer

00:30:44.538 --> 00:30:45.410
that question.
 

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:48.053
A Republican would say,
"What kind of a program is

00:30:48.053 --> 00:30:49.180
this if nobody knows?
 

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.259
Okay," they'll say,
"we may sign on to the

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:53.950
idea that the rich should give
some of their money to the poor,

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.442
but at least tell us how much
of our money we're giving to the

00:30:56.442 --> 00:30:56.730
poor.
 

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.630
We don't even know."
 

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.660
And then the Republicans say,
"We'd like equity-like

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:03.380
returns.
 

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.528
You know, why is it--"
This is what George Bush said.

00:31:05.528 --> 00:31:07.405
"Why is it that our
returns are going to be 2

00:31:07.405 --> 00:31:07.788
percent?
 

00:31:07.788 --> 00:31:12.250
I'd like to know that my money
is being invested in the stock

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:17.009
market and earning what I could
get in the stock market."

00:31:17.009 --> 00:31:20.294
Anyway, Republicans,
savvy investors like to think

00:31:20.294 --> 00:31:24.249
that the money that they're
being forced to save can get the

00:31:24.249 --> 00:31:28.068
same rate of return as they
could get for themselves.

00:31:28.068 --> 00:31:30.183
Why should they be cheated in a
government--never mind that they

00:31:30.183 --> 00:31:31.460
have to give away part of the
money.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.569
The part that they're not
giving away at least ought to

00:31:33.569 --> 00:31:34.430
earn equity returns.
 

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:38.640
And then Republicans tend to
think that choice is a good

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.068
thing,
not a bad thing,

00:31:40.068 --> 00:31:42.288
and so if you let people decide
how to invest,

00:31:42.288 --> 00:31:47.318
it'll be better for them than
if you--

00:31:47.318 --> 00:31:49.640
even if some of the people make
mistakes.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.363
Okay, so those are the
two--maybe some of you can add

00:31:52.363 --> 00:31:53.619
some other criticisms.
 

00:31:53.619 --> 00:31:55.250
Yeah?
 

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.974
Student:
Wouldn't any system that

00:31:57.974 --> 00:32:01.259
insures against living longer
than expected,

00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:03.770
that annuity type system,
have that problem in terms of

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.400
caring
&gt;?

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.028
You'd be unable to calculate
the present value,

00:32:08.028 --> 00:32:11.630
precisely because you're unable
to predict how long you live.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:16.683
So any system that successfully
&gt;

00:32:16.683 --> 00:32:21.740
is supposed to perform,
that's just an inherent issue.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.278
Prof: Yes.
 

00:32:22.278 --> 00:32:27.430
So no, I don't think so,
because--so his question is,

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.430
since we don't know how long
we're going to live,

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:32.970
and the program continues to
insure you for your entire life

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:35.130
and pay you for your entire
life,

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.910
how can you figure out what the
market value of that is?

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:42.328
Well, the fact is,
there is no general market.

00:32:42.328 --> 00:32:45.284
So you're right,
there is no general market you

00:32:45.284 --> 00:32:48.230
can look at now today,
that will tell you,

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:52.468
suppose we pay a fixed amount
of money for the average person

00:32:52.468 --> 00:32:55.094
in the economy,
what's the present value of

00:32:55.094 --> 00:32:55.380
that?
 

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.961
However, that doesn't mean we
couldn't have a market like

00:32:58.961 --> 00:32:59.410
that.
 

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:04.227
And so my solution is going to
involve precisely a market like

00:33:04.227 --> 00:33:04.778
that.
 

00:33:04.778 --> 00:33:09.480
So to answer his question,
it's not inherently impossible

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:14.347
to attach a market price to
paying somebody for the rest of

00:33:14.347 --> 00:33:15.440
his life.
 

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.480
After all, you could imagine
Social Security now,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.538
paying, let's say 50 million
people,

00:33:22.538 --> 00:33:24.723
the people who are now retired,
each of them is going to be

00:33:24.723 --> 00:33:26.720
paid for the rest of his life
according to a rule,

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.940
which we all understand.
 

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.490
It just goes up with inflation.
 

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.886
So you could say,
suppose you owned 1 percent of

00:33:32.886 --> 00:33:36.284
all those payments,
what would the value of that

00:33:36.284 --> 00:33:36.788
be?
 

00:33:36.788 --> 00:33:38.380
You could trade a security like
that.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.615
Somebody could say,
"I want to buy today a

00:33:40.615 --> 00:33:43.675
security that gives me 1 percent
of all the payments everybody's

00:33:43.675 --> 00:33:46.105
going to get,"
or it could be 1 percent of all

00:33:46.105 --> 00:33:48.972
of the payments every 70 year
old today is going to get from

00:33:48.972 --> 00:33:50.140
Social Security.
 

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.480
That's a well-defined thing and
it could trade in the market.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.880
You're going to see that the
market,

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.118
as soon as we start talking
about this,

00:33:55.118 --> 00:33:58.470
there is an incredible number
of derivative instruments,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.180
they're called,
that trade in the market.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:02.674
That could be a new one,
and then there would be a

00:34:02.674 --> 00:34:03.440
market price.
 

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.063
You're going to see,
when I propose my plan,

00:34:07.063 --> 00:34:10.349
that it involves something like
that.

00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:13.097
Any other questions about the
rules of Social Security or

00:34:13.097 --> 00:34:16.139
whether you think they're bad or
good for some other reason?

00:34:16.139 --> 00:34:18.684
I've tried to list the ones
that struck me as the most

00:34:18.684 --> 00:34:19.260
important.
 

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:19.989
Yeah?
 

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:22.050
Student:
What does it mean by a return?

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:25.818
Does it mean that you invest in
government bonds and then you

00:34:25.818 --> 00:34:29.150
get back taxes from another part
of the government?

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.199
Prof: Equity-like
returns?

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:31.000
Is this what you're referring
to?

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.550
Student:
&gt;

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:33.248
define the return.
 

00:34:33.248 --> 00:34:35.418
Isn't the interest you're
getting just taxes from another

00:34:35.418 --> 00:34:36.349
part of government?
 

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:40.181
Prof: Okay,
so you can always do this

00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:42.963
calculation,
which has historically been

00:34:42.963 --> 00:34:46.119
done, and I'm going to show you
those numbers in a second.

00:34:46.119 --> 00:34:50.552
You can always look at how many
tax--let's take someone my

00:34:50.552 --> 00:34:51.719
father's age.
 

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.389
My father actually died,
but a couple of years ago,

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.860
my father, he could look back
at his whole life,

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:59.273
and he could look at how much
money he paid in Social Security

00:34:59.273 --> 00:35:00.730
taxes when he was young.
 

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:04.119
Then he could look at what
benefits he got every year until

00:35:04.119 --> 00:35:04.880
that point.
 

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.510
Let's say it was the day after
he died.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.730
I could look at what he got
every year until he died.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:12.920
So then I could just--that's
just a sequence of cash flows.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.945
We know how to calculate the
internal rate of return of that

00:35:15.945 --> 00:35:16.510
sequence.
 

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:17.940
That's his rate of return.
 

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.420
And I showed you in the graph a
long time ago that that was

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:23.159
actually done historically.
 

00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:24.070
We've done that.
 

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:28.099
Leamer did that here.
 

00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:29.739
He did that for every
generation.

00:35:29.739 --> 00:35:31.518
Every birth cohort,
the average person,

00:35:31.518 --> 00:35:33.110
what their return was,
and you see,

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:35.780
it was very high to begin with
and it become pitiful.

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:40.467
If you forecast the future for
you, it's going to be less than

00:35:40.467 --> 00:35:41.389
2 percent.
 

00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:43.340
So Bush is saying,
"Why should you,

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:45.940
young Yale undergraduate,
why should you be satisfied

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.389
with less than 2 percent?
 

00:35:47.389 --> 00:35:49.768
Instead of paying those taxes
to Social Security,

00:35:49.768 --> 00:35:52.775
you put them in the stock
market, you get lots more than 2

00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:56.416
percent probably,
so why be satisfied with 2

00:35:56.416 --> 00:35:57.909
percent?"
 

00:35:57.909 --> 00:36:00.125
And Gore would say, "Well,
now we've got this pay as you

00:36:00.125 --> 00:36:01.621
go system,
you can't possibly put it in

00:36:01.621 --> 00:36:05.740
the stock market,
because then the old people

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.510
aren't going to get it."
 

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.809
Okay, any other questions?
 

00:36:12.809 --> 00:36:15.996
Any other reasons you think the
program is good or bad,

00:36:15.996 --> 00:36:17.059
Social Security.
 

00:36:17.059 --> 00:36:22.070
What's your feeling about
whether we should get rid of it

00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:25.469
or not or privatize it or change
it?

00:36:25.469 --> 00:36:27.239
Yeah.
 

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:30.373
Student:
It discriminates against people

00:36:30.373 --> 00:36:32.760
who are predisposed to die
early.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:38.400
It favors couples whose ages
are really far apart.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.139
It's extremely
&gt;

00:36:41.139 --> 00:36:43.079
Prof: Yes.
 

00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:46.639
He's saying other problems with
Social Security is that it

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:47.639
discriminates.
 

00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:50.909
It doesn't treat everybody
equally.

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:53.650
His first example was,
people who you can reasonably

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:56.766
expect to die sooner are going
to get a less good deal than

00:36:56.766 --> 00:36:59.559
people you can reasonably expect
to live longer.

00:36:59.559 --> 00:37:07.159
So what is the most basic class
that's being discriminated

00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:09.960
against, therefore?
 

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:14.697
Who among you can you predict
are going to live less long than

00:37:14.697 --> 00:37:17.960
others among you,
at least historically?

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.210
Presumably that will stay true.
 

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:21.440
Student: Men.
 

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.340
Prof: Men.
 

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.846
Okay, so men live 6 years less
long than women,

00:37:24.846 --> 00:37:26.590
so men are getting a bad deal.
 

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.528
Now black men,
historically--although this is

00:37:30.528 --> 00:37:33.802
rapidly changing,
but black men lived even less

00:37:33.802 --> 00:37:35.983
long,
even worse by a considerable

00:37:35.983 --> 00:37:41.057
degree,
so you'd think it discriminated

00:37:41.057 --> 00:37:43.809
against black men.
 

00:37:43.809 --> 00:37:46.492
Black men also tended to be
poorer on average though,

00:37:46.492 --> 00:37:49.586
so they were getting a better
return per year than rich white

00:37:49.586 --> 00:37:50.000
men.
 

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.465
But anyway, a black man with
the same earnings got a much

00:37:53.465 --> 00:37:57.056
worse deal historically on
Social Security than a white man

00:37:57.056 --> 00:37:59.773
with the same earnings,
because on average,

00:37:59.773 --> 00:38:01.900
the black man died before the
white man.

00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.974
That probably had a lot to do
with healthcare and nutrition

00:38:05.974 --> 00:38:09.630
and stuff like that,
and this is rapidly changing.

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:12.128
But anyway, certainly it seems
like men are going to get a

00:38:12.128 --> 00:38:13.179
worse deal than women.
 

00:38:13.179 --> 00:38:16.469
So yeah, there are all kinds of
little problems with Social

00:38:16.469 --> 00:38:17.659
Security like that.
 

00:38:17.659 --> 00:38:18.389
Anything else?
 

00:38:18.389 --> 00:38:23.650
He mentioned a couple of others
too.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.503
I regard those as less critical
though, than the problem of the

00:38:26.503 --> 00:38:28.576
thing going broke,
and these things which have

00:38:28.576 --> 00:38:29.590
split the country.
 

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:32.396
It's been impossible--so
basically, everybody thinks this

00:38:32.396 --> 00:38:33.849
is a logical contradiction.
 

00:38:33.849 --> 00:38:35.878
You can't do what the
Republicans want,

00:38:35.878 --> 00:38:38.389
at the same time,
do what the Democrats want.

00:38:38.389 --> 00:38:43.130
So what should you do?
 

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:44.699
Anything else anyone wants to
say?

00:38:44.699 --> 00:38:48.639
Someone else had their hand up
before.

00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:49.170
All right.
 

00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:52.849
So why did the system become
such a mess?

00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:53.989
How did it go broke?
 

00:38:53.989 --> 00:38:57.239
How should we have expected it
to go broke?

00:38:57.239 --> 00:39:04.719
Did it all happen because there
was the baby boom?

00:39:04.719 --> 00:39:08.099
All right, so I want to tell a
little parable.

00:39:08.099 --> 00:39:11.610
It has nothing to do with the
baby boom.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.447
Okay, so imagine that--and I'm
saying it in terms of fathers

00:39:15.447 --> 00:39:18.699
and sons, but I could say
mothers and daughters.

00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:21.940
So historically,
it was men working most of the

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:24.969
time, but let's do mothers and
daughters.

00:39:24.969 --> 00:39:30.583
So suppose a mother is old now
and sick and she needs an

00:39:30.583 --> 00:39:36.706
incredibly expensive operation,
a million dollars to save her

00:39:36.706 --> 00:39:39.360
or to extend her life.
 

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.351
She doesn't have the money,
so she goes to her daughter and

00:39:42.351 --> 00:39:44.880
she says, "I need a million
dollars."

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.480
And of course,
the daughter who loves her

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.840
wants to come up with the
million dollars to pay for her.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.679
But, you know,
that's a lot for her to pay.

00:39:51.679 --> 00:39:54.445
So she thinks to herself,
"My mother not only gave

00:39:54.445 --> 00:39:55.947
me life,
but let's face it,

00:39:55.947 --> 00:39:58.083
without her,
my daughter wouldn't have any

00:39:58.083 --> 00:40:00.740
life and her daughter wouldn't
have any life and her

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.929
granddaughter wouldn't have any
life.

00:40:02.929 --> 00:40:05.730
My mother's responsible for not
just me, but for all these

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:06.860
generations after me.
 

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.891
Why should I be the one to pay
the entire benefit of my

00:40:10.891 --> 00:40:12.460
mother's operation?
 

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.929
So you know what I'm going to
do?

00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:17.260
I'll give her the million
dollars, but when I get old,

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.219
I'm going to go to my daughter
and say,

00:40:19.219 --> 00:40:21.833
'Daughter of mine,
I sacrificed for your

00:40:21.833 --> 00:40:23.579
grandmother,
my mother.

00:40:23.579 --> 00:40:25.630
I put up a million dollars to
save her.

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.139
I'm broke now.
 

00:40:27.139 --> 00:40:30.195
Maybe I don't need an
operation, but I'm basically

00:40:30.195 --> 00:40:34.250
totally broke because I spent so
much money rescuing my mother.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.664
Why don't you do the same for
me that I did for my mother and

00:40:37.664 --> 00:40:39.260
give me a million dollars?
 

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.836
And by the way,
you could use the same argument

00:40:41.836 --> 00:40:44.190
with your daughter,
and so it's really not so bad,

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:46.168
because you're going to get the
money back when you're

00:40:46.168 --> 00:40:48.635
old.'"
And so the granddaughter agrees

00:40:48.635 --> 00:40:51.648
and pays the daughter,
and then when she gets old,

00:40:51.648 --> 00:40:53.309
she does the same thing.
 

00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:56.829
It goes on for generation after
generation.

00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:58.849
Now let's say it went on
forever.

00:40:58.849 --> 00:41:00.619
How did this happen?
 

00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:06.460
Did nobody lose anything and we
paid for the operation to begin

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.119
with?
 

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:11.829
Is this some kind of Ponzi
scheme or something?

00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:13.889
Where did the million-dollar
operation get financed?

00:41:13.889 --> 00:41:17.820
How did that happen?
 

00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:22.360
Who paid for it?
 

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.550
Yes?
 

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.025
Student:
Don't you pay the opportunity

00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:27.030
cost &gt;
 

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.639
million dollars and
&gt;

00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:32.030
individual lifetime when the
money could have gone and made

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:35.130
money itself rather than
spending on the operation?

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:36.896
Prof: Well,
you got a million dollars back,

00:41:36.896 --> 00:41:37.980
remember, when you were old.
 

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.728
Student:
&gt;

00:41:38.728 --> 00:41:39.365
nothing more than a million
dollars

00:41:39.365 --> 00:41:39.909
&gt;
 

00:41:39.909 --> 00:41:41.949
Prof: Okay, exactly.
 

00:41:41.949 --> 00:41:43.130
So that's the whole point.
 

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.976
The point is that the
daughter--just to repeat what he

00:41:48.976 --> 00:41:49.750
said.
 

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.869
The first daughter paid a
million dollars when she was

00:41:52.869 --> 00:41:53.340
young.
 

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:55.054
Yes, she got the million
dollars back,

00:41:55.054 --> 00:41:57.510
but when she was old,
and that's a long time later.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.969
So for that whole time,
she made a 0 percent interest.

00:42:00.969 --> 00:42:04.355
Now maybe the interest rate
was, let's say,

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:08.547
over that many years,
we're talking about 30 years or

00:42:08.547 --> 00:42:11.530
40 years, a large amount of
time.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:14.538
So the interest rate could
easily, over 40 years,

00:42:14.538 --> 00:42:17.610
you divide 40 into 72,
you know, it's like 1 and 3

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:19.239
quarters or something.
 

00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:21.920
So if the real interest rate
was 1 and 3 quarters,

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.369
something like that,
you could easily imagine,

00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:28.429
that was the doubling rule,
that 100 dollars could have

00:42:28.429 --> 00:42:30.159
been turned into 200.
 

00:42:30.159 --> 00:42:33.800
So the first daughter who took
her 100 dollars could have had

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.619
200 by the time she was old.
 

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:37.659
She only got 100 when she was
old.

00:42:37.659 --> 00:42:41.012
So in present value terms,
she gave up 100 when she was

00:42:41.012 --> 00:42:41.510
young.
 

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:44.791
She got, in present value
terms, 50 dollars when she was

00:42:44.791 --> 00:42:45.150
old.
 

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.190
So she gave away 50 dollars.
 

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:51.579
She paid for half the operation.
 

00:42:51.579 --> 00:42:54.159
Now where did the rest of the
50 dollars come from?

00:42:54.159 --> 00:42:57.289
Well, the granddaughter gave
100 when she was young,

00:42:57.289 --> 00:43:00.480
got 100 when she was old,
so in present value terms,

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.780
she also lost 50 dollars,
exactly the same amount as the

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:04.800
first daughter.
 

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.119
She gave up the same thing.
 

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:07.889
Her contribution was just as
big.

00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:12.800
Of course, it came a lot later,
so in present value terms,

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.291
at the time of the operation,
the granddaughter's

00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:17.159
contribution is discounted
twice,

00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:18.650
so it's 1 half of 1 half.
 

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.943
So she only contributed in
present value terms 25 dollars

00:43:22.943 --> 00:43:24.400
to the operation.
 

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.458
And then the great
granddaughter,

00:43:26.458 --> 00:43:30.000
she herself looks at it as a 50
dollar contribution,

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.280
but from the point of view of
the original operation,

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:35.820
it's discounted 3 times,
so by 8, so it's 12 and 1 half.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:38.755
So 50 25 12 and 1 half 6 and 1
quarter, blah,

00:43:38.755 --> 00:43:41.559
blah, blah, forever,
adds up to the 100.

00:43:41.559 --> 00:43:45.068
So basically,
this parable shows how a

00:43:45.068 --> 00:43:51.137
daughter could share the cost of
her mother's operation among all

00:43:51.137 --> 00:43:54.202
the descendants,
pay completely for the

00:43:54.202 --> 00:43:57.230
operation with each generation
making the same contribution,

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:58.619
the same sacrifice.
 

00:43:58.619 --> 00:44:01.925
Of course, the generations who
make it earlier are helping the

00:44:01.925 --> 00:44:03.927
mother more,
but the point is,

00:44:03.927 --> 00:44:07.773
every generation has made
exactly the same sacrifice and

00:44:07.773 --> 00:44:11.900
that's how the original mother's
operation got paid for.

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.559
Now what happens in generation
10,

00:44:14.559 --> 00:44:16.697
the great great great great
great great granddaughter is

00:44:16.697 --> 00:44:18.072
going to say,
"You know,

00:44:18.072 --> 00:44:20.280
I never even heard of this
original mother.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.110
I couldn't care less about her
operation.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:25.880
It wasn't a very good operation
anyway, because she died three

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.380
years later, because medicine
was so bad at the time.

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.355
So why should I be paying my
contribution to that original

00:44:32.355 --> 00:44:33.820
mother's operation?
 

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.699
Yes, I know that she's
responsible for my life,

00:44:35.699 --> 00:44:37.333
but you know,
I don't know anything about

00:44:37.333 --> 00:44:37.659
her.
 

00:44:37.659 --> 00:44:39.070
I don't even know her name any
more.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.389
How come I have to keep paying
for it?

00:44:41.389 --> 00:44:43.409
So I just want to stop."
 

00:44:43.409 --> 00:44:47.733
Now why is it going to be
actually difficult for that

00:44:47.733 --> 00:44:49.480
generation to stop?
 

00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:51.237
"I just don't want to give
my money to that first

00:44:51.237 --> 00:44:51.670
generation.
 

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:52.579
I couldn't care less.
 

00:44:52.579 --> 00:44:54.090
Let's stop right now."
 

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:54.610
Yes?
 

00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.916
Student:
She's not giving the money to

00:44:56.916 --> 00:44:59.637
her great great grandmother;
she's giving it to her own

00:44:59.637 --> 00:44:59.989
mother.
 

00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:01.889
Prof: Her own mother,
exactly.

00:45:01.889 --> 00:45:05.737
So you can't stop just in the
middle because it's like the

00:45:05.737 --> 00:45:08.710
gift is being re-enacted every
generation.

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.090
So the new generation that
stops, even if they understand

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:15.592
where the whole thing began,
they're not going to screw the

00:45:15.592 --> 00:45:16.800
original mother.
 

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.909
They're going to screw their
own mother, which they probably

00:45:19.909 --> 00:45:22.438
don't want to do,
so they're not going to want to

00:45:22.438 --> 00:45:23.440
stop the thing.
 

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:26.309
So to say the parable very
shortly,

00:45:26.309 --> 00:45:29.690
the first generation that got
taxes--

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:33.510
got benefits without
contributing anything,

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:35.559
that was a huge amount of money
that they got.

00:45:35.559 --> 00:45:38.869
Every generation after that
lost money,

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:42.320
but that was all a way to pay
the first generation,

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.490
and you can't stop the cycle
without screwing your own

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:46.090
parents.
 

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:50.349
So it's very difficult for the
thing to be stopped.

00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:56.469
Now you could make it a little
bit more realistic by saying

00:45:56.469 --> 00:46:01.215
every generation,
wages grow every generation,

00:46:01.215 --> 00:46:06.070
say between 1 and 2 percent in
real terms.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.880
That's the historical rate of
growth.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.173
By the way, it hasn't been so
great lately,

00:46:10.173 --> 00:46:13.179
but anyway, historically,
say 1 to 2 percent real growth

00:46:13.179 --> 00:46:13.889
of wages.
 

00:46:13.889 --> 00:46:18.489
So on an annualized basis,
if you did the same thing with

00:46:18.489 --> 00:46:23.500
each generation paying 12
percent of their youthful wages,

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:27.539
you would find that--now we're
coming closer to reality--

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:31.666
that every generation was going
to get between 1 and 2 percent

00:46:31.666 --> 00:46:35.617
return on their contributions,
because the young would

00:46:35.617 --> 00:46:38.530
contribute 12 dollars out of 100
say,

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:41.590
but their daughter,
that lady's daughter,

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:44.041
30 years later,
the wages would have grown by 1

00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:46.440
to 2 percent every year for
those 30 years.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.483
So 12 percent of that bigger
number would go to that

00:46:49.483 --> 00:46:53.242
daughter, and so there would be
a rate of return between 1 and 2

00:46:53.242 --> 00:46:53.960
percent.
 

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.157
And that's exactly what Bush
and everybody else is

00:46:56.157 --> 00:46:56.739
predicting.
 

00:46:56.739 --> 00:47:01.222
So now you understand where the
1 to 2 percent comes from that

00:47:01.222 --> 00:47:02.840
you're going to get.
 

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.813
If the population is stable,
the ratio of young to old,

00:47:05.813 --> 00:47:09.117
the rate of return on Social
Security is going to be equal to

00:47:09.117 --> 00:47:10.880
the rate of growth of wages.
 

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.472
So it's not 0 as in the first
parable, because wages are

00:47:13.472 --> 00:47:14.369
actually growing.
 

00:47:14.369 --> 00:47:17.342
It's between 1 and 2 percent,
which is a bad return compared

00:47:17.342 --> 00:47:20.114
to the rate of interest,
and that's why every generation

00:47:20.114 --> 00:47:20.820
is losing.
 

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:26.030
Okay, so let's do one more
thing.

00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:28.856
So the baby boom,
does the baby boom make things

00:47:28.856 --> 00:47:29.940
worse or better?
 

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:31.460
How can you think about it?
 

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.030
It's so simple minded to think
this way.

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.208
It's amazing;
the public is so confused about

00:47:36.208 --> 00:47:36.489
this.
 

00:47:36.489 --> 00:47:39.440
Suppose you have a baby boom
generation.

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.407
So you're going on with all
these mothers,

00:47:41.407 --> 00:47:44.239
we're back to the mother and
the daughter with 1 million.

00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:46.824
So let's say there's one
mother, one daughter,

00:47:46.824 --> 00:47:48.719
one person in every generation.
 

00:47:48.719 --> 00:47:52.202
All of a sudden,
there's a baby boom generation,

00:47:52.202 --> 00:47:55.538
but of course,
to be old, you have to be young

00:47:55.538 --> 00:47:56.280
first.
 

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:00.690
So let's say in some generation
after a bunch of times,

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:04.449
there are 2 daughters instead
of 1 daughter.

00:48:04.449 --> 00:48:13.288
Each of them is not going to
pay--if the tax rate stays the

00:48:13.288 --> 00:48:20.449
same and the young daughters now
each pay 1,

00:48:20.449 --> 00:48:23.900
the mother who's alive then
only needs 1 when she gets old.

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.748
So 2 daughters now have 1 to
contribute, so half of their

00:48:27.748 --> 00:48:31.182
money goes to paying off the
mother when she's old,

00:48:31.182 --> 00:48:34.070
just like would have usually
happened.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.983
But the baby generation,
because it's young first,

00:48:36.983 --> 00:48:40.489
that means when I was young,
my generation was making a huge

00:48:40.489 --> 00:48:41.679
amount of money.
 

00:48:41.679 --> 00:48:42.409
We're doing it now.
 

00:48:42.409 --> 00:48:43.760
That's why there's a surplus.
 

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.869
There's this gigantic surplus
being put in to Social Security,

00:48:46.869 --> 00:48:49.800
and so when my generation gets
old,

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.530
the dollar that didn't have to
go to the mother,

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:54.820
because there was an extra
dollar there,

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.230
that could be earning the rate
of interest.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.510
And so at the end,
when we get old,

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:02.753
there are going to be 2 of us,
and there's only going to be 1

00:49:02.753 --> 00:49:04.969
child next generation to
contribute 1,

00:49:04.969 --> 00:49:06.639
and we're going to be expecting
1.

00:49:06.639 --> 00:49:09.713
But see, the 1 that was put in
when we were young has now grown

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:10.059
to 2.
 

00:49:10.059 --> 00:49:11.824
You've got 2 there,
plus another 1,

00:49:11.824 --> 00:49:14.264
that's 3, so there actually
should be a surplus,

00:49:14.264 --> 00:49:15.199
not a deficit.
 

00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:16.010
Did you follow that?
 

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.179
Did that go too fast?
 

00:49:17.179 --> 00:49:20.693
So I'm saying that every
generation, you give 1,

00:49:20.693 --> 00:49:23.983
you get 1, you give 1,
you get 1, you give 1,

00:49:23.983 --> 00:49:25.030
you get 1.
 

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:27.655
All of a sudden,
there are 2 people,

00:49:27.655 --> 00:49:31.630
so they're each giving 1,
so none of them is worse off

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:32.829
than before.
 

00:49:32.829 --> 00:49:34.599
When they get old,
they're going to need 2.

00:49:34.599 --> 00:49:36.650
You've only got 1 person
contributing.

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:39.992
So here's the baby boom,
double the size of all the

00:49:39.992 --> 00:49:41.329
other generations.
 

00:49:41.329 --> 00:49:43.869
When they're old,
it looks like a problem.

00:49:43.869 --> 00:49:45.190
Who's going to take care of
these people?

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.059
There're not enough young
people to take care of them.

00:49:47.059 --> 00:49:49.074
But remember,
they were young before they

00:49:49.074 --> 00:49:49.630
were old.
 

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.186
So since this mother only needs
1 and there are 2 of these

00:49:52.186 --> 00:49:54.286
daughters,
the extra 1 could be invested

00:49:54.286 --> 00:49:57.318
and the 1 that's invested is
going to make a rate of return

00:49:57.318 --> 00:50:00.050
and become more than 1,
like close to 2.

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:03.266
And so you'll have the 1 from
the new daughter,

00:50:03.266 --> 00:50:07.461
plus almost 2 that was saved,
that was in the Social Security

00:50:07.461 --> 00:50:09.980
trust fund and earning interest.
 

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.606
So you'll actually have 3
dollars to make up for the 2,

00:50:12.606 --> 00:50:15.282
and so it's not a problem at
all that you have this baby

00:50:15.282 --> 00:50:15.719
boom.
 

00:50:15.719 --> 00:50:18.179
In fact, it's a benefit that we
had the baby boom.

00:50:18.179 --> 00:50:20.139
So basically,
what did the baby boom do?

00:50:20.139 --> 00:50:22.449
It staved off the original
problem.

00:50:22.449 --> 00:50:26.030
So let's just think about this
one more time.

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.896
Suppose that you have a
slightly more realistic example,

00:50:28.896 --> 00:50:31.449
the kind you're going to do in
the problem set.

00:50:31.449 --> 00:50:38.168
Suppose that you've got--people
live from 20 to 80 and they pay

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:44.780
taxes and work from 20 to 60 and
they retire from 60 to 80.

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.302
Everybody's paying 12 dollars
in Social Security taxes when

00:50:48.302 --> 00:50:50.472
working,
and there's a 0 rate of

00:50:50.472 --> 00:50:52.760
interest, and they're getting
24--

00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.684
maybe I have a rate--they're
getting 24 dollars when they're

00:50:55.684 --> 00:50:56.920
retired,
in benefits.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.789
Okay, so the system balances
every year,

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:02.409
because in every generation,
these are the birth years,

00:51:02.409 --> 00:51:08.438
the thing started in 1938,
and then they collected taxes

00:51:08.438 --> 00:51:10.739
for a little while.
 

00:51:10.739 --> 00:51:14.181
Frances Perkins got in action
and so they decided to go to pay

00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:14.860
as you go.
 

00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.445
To--let's just assume it
started pay as you go from the

00:51:17.445 --> 00:51:18.260
very beginning.
 

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.255
So in 1940, you see in 1940,
the people who are 60,

00:51:22.255 --> 00:51:26.570
the 1880 generation,
would have two decades to live.

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:32.369
So these guys--oh,
I'm sorry, I never put this.

00:51:32.369 --> 00:51:34.943
Not that it mattered,
but it would have been a little

00:51:34.943 --> 00:51:35.389
better.
 

00:51:35.389 --> 00:51:39.057
So these guys,
the 60 year olds here,

00:51:39.057 --> 00:51:44.152
and these 70 year olds,
the 70 year olds and the 60

00:51:44.152 --> 00:51:47.719
year olds are collecting money.
 

00:51:47.719 --> 00:51:50.273
Now the original start of
Social Security was a little

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:50.659
fuzzy.
 

00:51:50.659 --> 00:51:53.155
They didn't want to pay people
who had never contributed,

00:51:53.155 --> 00:51:55.650
so these 70 year olds weren't
really getting anything.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.849
Okay, let's just keep for the
simple, steady state.

00:51:58.849 --> 00:52:03.518
So the point is,
the 60 year olds are collecting

00:52:03.518 --> 00:52:04.809
24 dollars.
 

00:52:04.809 --> 00:52:07.990
The 70 year olds are collecting
24 dollars, and each of these

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:09.847
generations, the 50,40,
30s and 20s,

00:52:09.847 --> 00:52:11.650
they're all paying 12 dollars.
 

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:15.340
So the contributions are
exactly matching the benefits.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.989
So the system is perfectly in
balance.

00:52:16.989 --> 00:52:20.389
Now what happens the next
decade?

00:52:20.389 --> 00:52:24.380
You've got the new 70 year olds.
 

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:27.452
It's this next generation,
plus these guys,

00:52:27.452 --> 00:52:30.965
who have now turned 70,
who had been contributing

00:52:30.965 --> 00:52:31.768
before.
 

00:52:31.768 --> 00:52:33.980
Now they're in their 60s,
sorry, they're in these 60s.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.260
These guys in their 70s,
these guys in their 60s,

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.018
and then here are the
contributors.

00:52:38.018 --> 00:52:40.518
This new generation has now
come on board to contribute.

00:52:40.518 --> 00:52:42.960
So again, there's balance every
generation.

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.639
Okay, but now who are the
winners and the losers?

00:52:45.639 --> 00:52:48.050
Well, you know,
it's much worse than it sounded

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:50.512
at first glance,
because people live longer than

00:52:50.512 --> 00:52:51.090
1 year.
 

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:54.612
So you see these people,
in the '40s,

00:52:54.612 --> 00:52:57.550
all these guys were gaining.
 

00:52:57.550 --> 00:53:01.117
So this generation of 1870,
they have almost an infinite

00:53:01.117 --> 00:53:02.219
rate of return.
 

00:53:02.219 --> 00:53:04.429
They made no contributions.
 

00:53:04.429 --> 00:53:07.916
These guys, they also made no
contributions and they're

00:53:07.916 --> 00:53:11.143
getting huge returns,
because they're getting them,

00:53:11.143 --> 00:53:13.340
you know, 20 years of returns.
 

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.081
But it's worse than that,
because when we go to the next

00:53:16.081 --> 00:53:18.353
generation,
these guys, they actually

00:53:18.353 --> 00:53:21.000
contributed when they were in
their 50s,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.259
but that wasn't very long
before they retired and they got

00:53:25.259 --> 00:53:29.219
24 dollars of benefits and 24
dollars of benefits,

00:53:29.219 --> 00:53:31.650
having paid only 12 dollars of
taxes.

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.447
Of course, this came later,
but 48 compared to 12,

00:53:34.447 --> 00:53:36.559
they got a gigantic rate of
return.

00:53:36.559 --> 00:53:39.663
You go to the next generation,
and they're making out like

00:53:39.663 --> 00:53:42.440
bandits too, because they only
contributed twice.

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.822
Okay so in the '40s,
a bunch of people were making

00:53:44.822 --> 00:53:46.914
money, getting benefits,
who didn't make any

00:53:46.914 --> 00:53:47.789
contributions.
 

00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:49.806
In the '50s,
a bunch of people were

00:53:49.806 --> 00:53:52.949
making--getting benefits who
made no contributions.

00:53:52.949 --> 00:53:55.543
In the '60s,
there are still people getting

00:53:55.543 --> 00:53:57.829
benefits who made no
contributions.

00:53:57.829 --> 00:54:02.514
It's not till you get to the
'80s, once people are fully

00:54:02.514 --> 00:54:06.690
retired, having made 40 years of
contributions.

00:54:06.690 --> 00:54:09.615
So from 40 to 80,
it's not until the '80s that

00:54:09.615 --> 00:54:13.128
the people who are getting
benefits were all people who

00:54:13.128 --> 00:54:14.559
fully contributed.
 

00:54:14.559 --> 00:54:18.590
Okay, so all these people were
getting an incredibly good deal.

00:54:18.590 --> 00:54:23.889
We had 40 years of people
getting extra returns.

00:54:23.889 --> 00:54:27.449
If you just do the distributive
law of arithmetic,

00:54:27.449 --> 00:54:29.797
and you realize that all these
things go off to infinity

00:54:29.797 --> 00:54:32.576
because they're discounted,
you can sum them in either

00:54:32.576 --> 00:54:33.210
direction.
 

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:36.329
You can sum down the columns,
and that's always 0.

00:54:36.329 --> 00:54:38.940
The benefits and the
contributions always net to 0,

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.820
but therefore,
if you add up the rows,

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.050
which is what each generation
gets,

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:45.719
they also have to add up to 0.
 

00:54:45.719 --> 00:54:47.871
But you see,
there's so many original

00:54:47.871 --> 00:54:48.710
generations.
 

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:50.449
This one got a huge benefit.
 

00:54:50.449 --> 00:54:52.280
This one got huge benefits.
 

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:55.021
The present value of their
contributions relative to their

00:54:55.021 --> 00:54:57.619
benefits is incredibly positive
for that generation.

00:54:57.619 --> 00:55:00.119
For this generation,
it's still incredibly positive.

00:55:00.119 --> 00:55:03.369
Remember, this is 12,12,
and this is 24,24.

00:55:03.369 --> 00:55:05.480
For this generation,
it's probably still positive.

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:08.067
Not till you get to here has it
become--well,

00:55:08.067 --> 00:55:10.949
not till you get to here does
something change.

00:55:10.949 --> 00:55:13.659
So this is a positive number,
this is a big positive number.

00:55:13.659 --> 00:55:15.110
This is a gigantic positive
number.

00:55:15.110 --> 00:55:16.639
This is a huge positive number.
 

00:55:16.639 --> 00:55:19.179
You add up over all these
things positive.

00:55:19.179 --> 00:55:22.885
The rest of these generations
have to be negative to just

00:55:22.885 --> 00:55:24.539
balance the thing at 0.
 

00:55:24.539 --> 00:55:27.577
So that's why every generation
from here down to here is going

00:55:27.577 --> 00:55:29.420
to have to earn a negative
return,

00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:32.275
basically in steady state,
they'd all earn the same

00:55:32.275 --> 00:55:35.840
negative present value,
or the same bad rate of return.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.257
And there were so many
generations that got positive

00:55:38.257 --> 00:55:39.159
amounts of money.
 

00:55:39.159 --> 00:55:41.686
So in today's dollars,
can you tell me how much money

00:55:41.686 --> 00:55:43.969
that we gave away to these early
generations?

00:55:43.969 --> 00:55:49.349
Can you take a guess,
just order of magnitude?

00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:51.974
So I'm asking in today's
dollars, today's present value

00:55:51.974 --> 00:55:52.460
dollars.
 

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:54.835
Whatever the number is,
you have to assume it grew at

00:55:54.835 --> 00:55:56.389
the rate of interest since then.
 

00:55:56.389 --> 00:55:59.090
So what do you think that is?
 

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:00.059
Student: Couple trillion.
 

00:56:00.059 --> 00:56:00.840
Prof: Couple trillion.
 

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:02.239
Does someone want to guess?
 

00:56:02.239 --> 00:56:04.987
Reasonable guess,
but someone want to make

00:56:04.987 --> 00:56:06.059
another guess?
 

00:56:06.059 --> 00:56:10.250
Just so you get an idea of the
size of the program.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:14.130
Does anybody know what GNP is
in the country?

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:15.059
Student: $15 trillion.
 

00:56:15.059 --> 00:56:16.625
Prof: Okay,
$14 trillion,

00:56:16.625 --> 00:56:18.090
something like that is GNP.
 

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:23.210
So what do you guess this
number is?

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:25.340
Okay, it's $17 trillion.
 

00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:26.400
He guessed $2 trillion.
 

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.710
It's $17 trillion.
 

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:31.255
So we made a staggering
transfer of income to these

00:56:31.255 --> 00:56:34.405
people at the beginning,
and now somebody's got to pay

00:56:34.405 --> 00:56:36.579
for that and it's not a trivial
thing to pay for,

00:56:36.579 --> 00:56:38.639
because $17 trillion,
if everybody gave,

00:56:38.639 --> 00:56:41.141
every corporation,
every person in the whole

00:56:41.141 --> 00:56:44.400
country gave away all the money
they made for a year,

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:45.980
we still wouldn't pay it down.
 

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:49.697
So that's a big amount that's
hanging over everybody,

00:56:49.697 --> 00:56:53.199
and that's what the Social
Security problem is.

00:56:53.199 --> 00:56:55.744
We gave away so much money at
the beginning,

00:56:55.744 --> 00:56:58.882
if we keep the system in
balance, we have to gradually

00:56:58.882 --> 00:57:00.539
give all the money back.
 

00:57:00.539 --> 00:57:03.041
And we can't stop it,
because then some old guys are

00:57:03.041 --> 00:57:04.170
going to get screwed.
 

00:57:04.170 --> 00:57:07.713
So there's no way of stopping
the thing and each generation

00:57:07.713 --> 00:57:08.570
has to lose.
 

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:11.628
So the reason why you're
getting such low rates of return

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:14.632
is because the system was
designed--Frances Perkins knew

00:57:14.632 --> 00:57:15.889
what she was doing.
 

00:57:15.889 --> 00:57:18.460
She wanted to help all those
old people in the '40s.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.411
Now she was out of power in the
'50s and '60s,

00:57:20.411 --> 00:57:22.840
you know, when we were still
helping all those people.

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.664
But the point is,
there was a tremendous transfer

00:57:24.664 --> 00:57:26.432
of wealth,
so there were entire

00:57:26.432 --> 00:57:29.422
generations of that era,
and that's the reason why

00:57:29.422 --> 00:57:32.139
everybody's getting such a bad
rate of return now.

00:57:32.139 --> 00:57:36.420
It's not because the money's
being lost or thrown away.

00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:40.139
So what I'm telling you now is
not controversial.

00:57:40.139 --> 00:57:42.724
I don't think many people
understand it,

00:57:42.724 --> 00:57:46.239
but everyone who does
understand it agrees with it.

00:57:46.239 --> 00:57:48.320
When come to my solution,
they're not going to agree.

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.014
But anyway, so what I'm telling
you, just to compute,

00:57:52.014 --> 00:57:55.710
in the problem set you have to
compute an example.

00:57:55.710 --> 00:58:00.409
So let's just see how this
would work.

00:58:00.409 --> 00:58:03.530
So suppose from the point of
view of a 10 year old,

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:06.445
just doing the example I did,
suppose there's a 15 percent

00:58:06.445 --> 00:58:09.371
rate of interest,
and you're going to contribute

00:58:09.371 --> 00:58:12.474
in your 20s,
12 dollars, 12 percent,

00:58:12.474 --> 00:58:15.268
so no growth in the economy.
 

00:58:15.268 --> 00:58:18.659
So it's 12 dollars all the time
when you're in your 20s,

00:58:18.659 --> 00:58:19.829
30s, 40s and 50s.
 

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:23.610
So what would you do from the
point of view age 10?

00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:27.639
That's 10 years before your 20s.
 

00:58:27.639 --> 00:58:29.500
You're going to contribute 12
dollars in your 20s.

00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.550
You discount it at the 15
percent rate of interest.

00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:36.829
You're going to be contributing
12 dollars in your 30s,

00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:38.820
so you discount it at 15
percent twice,

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:41.449
and in your 40s,
you're giving up 12 dollars,

00:58:41.449 --> 00:58:44.389
you're discounting it to 15
percent 3 times,

00:58:44.389 --> 00:58:46.184
and in your 50s,
you're doing it,

00:58:46.184 --> 00:58:48.268
12 dollars,
so you're discounting it 4

00:58:48.268 --> 00:58:48.619
times.
 

00:58:48.619 --> 00:58:52.900
So that's the present value.
 

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.090
From the point of view of a
young girl,

00:58:56.090 --> 00:58:58.391
looking at what you're going to
be forced to contribute over

00:58:58.391 --> 00:59:00.552
your life,
those are the taxes you can

00:59:00.552 --> 00:59:02.880
expect to pay in present value
terms.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.230
Now of course,
when you get old,

00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.945
in your 60s and 70s,
you're going to get benefits,

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:12.889
24 dollars, much higher than
the taxes you paid.

00:59:12.889 --> 00:59:14.871
But by then,
it's 5 decades later,

00:59:14.871 --> 00:59:18.235
so you're discounting it 5
times, and when you're in your

00:59:18.235 --> 00:59:20.579
70s, you're discounting it 6
times.

00:59:20.579 --> 00:59:24.496
So you have to discount by 6,
so the present value of that is

00:59:24.496 --> 00:59:27.239
way less than the present value
of this.

00:59:27.239 --> 00:59:31.554
So you see that the loss in
present value terms is going to

00:59:31.554 --> 00:59:34.157
be 11 dollars,
11 dollars out of 34,

00:59:34.157 --> 00:59:36.909
which is what your benefits
were.

00:59:36.909 --> 00:59:39.760
So your loss is something like
34 percent.

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:42.670
So this is just--I made up
these numbers.

00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:46.286
The actual loss,
which I computed for the real

00:59:46.286 --> 00:59:48.860
economy, is around 25 percent.
 

00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:52.648
So that's how big each
generation, 1 quarter of the

00:59:52.648 --> 00:59:55.300
typical--so here it's 34
percent.

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:58.654
1 quarter to 1 third in this
example of each generation's

00:59:58.654 --> 01:00:01.469
Social Security taxes are simply
being lost,

01:00:01.469 --> 01:00:06.346
frittered away,
and basically used to pay off

01:00:06.346 --> 01:00:10.780
the debt from the original
generation.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:14.969
Now if you want to look at the
total present value loss,

01:00:14.969 --> 01:00:20.130
starting in the 1930s,
for people born in the 1930s,

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:24.054
you have to look at every
generation's losing the same

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:28.500
11.95 and so you take the
infinite future of generations,

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:32.018
and they're losing 79.68,
if you add up to infinity,

01:00:32.018 --> 01:00:36.014
and of course,
that's the gain that was given

01:00:36.014 --> 01:00:38.739
to the original generations.
 

01:00:38.739 --> 01:00:43.936
Okay, so that's the kind of
example you're going to work

01:00:43.936 --> 01:00:47.809
out, except for with realistic
numbers.

01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:50.539
Okay, and so I just do--you're
going to do that anyway.

01:00:50.539 --> 01:00:52.139
All right, so that's it.
 

01:00:52.139 --> 01:00:56.018
So now, if you look at which
generation's got the most money,

01:00:56.018 --> 01:00:58.472
at the beginning,
there weren't many people in

01:00:58.472 --> 01:01:01.672
Social Security,
and so the amount of money that

01:01:01.672 --> 01:01:04.052
they got,
the benefits that the really

01:01:04.052 --> 01:01:05.786
old got,
there were so few of them that

01:01:05.786 --> 01:01:07.739
if you add it up,
it wasn't that big.

01:01:07.739 --> 01:01:10.996
So the generation that
benefited the most was my

01:01:10.996 --> 01:01:14.530
father's generation and James
Tobin's generation.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:17.130
Tobin, as we'll see in a
second, he used to tell me all

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:18.811
the time--
he was Yale's most famous

01:01:18.811 --> 01:01:20.788
economist,
and I happen to be the James

01:01:20.788 --> 01:01:23.288
Tobin professor,
so I have quite a fondness for

01:01:23.288 --> 01:01:23.550
him.
 

01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:27.369
I also went to the same high
school he went to in Illinois.

01:01:27.369 --> 01:01:31.293
Anyway, he used to tell me that
the problem with Social Security

01:01:31.293 --> 01:01:32.963
was,
we didn't have enough--I didn't

01:01:32.963 --> 01:01:35.009
have enough children,
and I would tell him the

01:01:35.009 --> 01:01:37.219
problem with Social Security was
we gave him,

01:01:37.219 --> 01:01:38.807
his birth date,
too much money,

01:01:38.807 --> 01:01:40.980
and that's why we're all
suffering now.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.677
So you can see all the
generations and which ones,

01:01:43.677 --> 01:01:46.320
which generation got the most
amount of money.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.070
So that I also calculated.
 

01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:53.960
Now this parable is not exactly
accurate.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.029
So you know,
in the parable,

01:01:56.029 --> 01:02:00.320
we should have had a crisis in
1970, it should have been,

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:01.239
or 1980.
 

01:02:01.239 --> 01:02:05.239
I told you the people in 1980
should already have realized--

01:02:05.239 --> 01:02:07.969
the generation starting to work
in 1980,

01:02:07.969 --> 01:02:10.929
so born in 1960,
a lot younger than you are,

01:02:10.929 --> 01:02:13.423
they should already have
realized that they're getting a

01:02:13.423 --> 01:02:16.195
bad deal in Social Security,
and so we should have had all

01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:17.280
this come much sooner.
 

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:24.250
So what kept the problem from
manifesting itself until now?

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.802
Well, what kept the problem
from manifesting itself until

01:02:26.802 --> 01:02:28.489
now is actually quite easy to
see,

01:02:28.489 --> 01:02:32.804
is there were a lot more young
people per old in the historical

01:02:32.804 --> 01:02:33.780
generations.
 

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.594
Now we're leveling off and
everybody thinks we're going to

01:02:37.594 --> 01:02:39.869
be 2 young people for every old.
 

01:02:39.869 --> 01:02:42.835
The story I sort of told,
working from 40 to 60 and

01:02:42.835 --> 01:02:45.445
retired from 60 to 80 in a
stable population,

01:02:45.445 --> 01:02:48.530
that's coming close to what
we're converging to.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:51.204
So there are going to be 2
young for every old,

01:02:51.204 --> 01:02:53.239
where there used to be 3,4 and
5.

01:02:53.239 --> 01:02:56.059
Now how could there have been
so many young for all the old?

01:02:56.059 --> 01:02:59.438
Well, you know,
women at the beginning,

01:02:59.438 --> 01:03:02.639
in this period,
they were working.

01:03:02.639 --> 01:03:04.909
Women were surging into the
labor force.

01:03:04.909 --> 01:03:06.795
There were a huge number of
young women working,

01:03:06.795 --> 01:03:08.599
but their mothers actually
weren't working.

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:11.648
They had not worked and so they
were getting half their

01:03:11.648 --> 01:03:14.646
husband's benefits,
not the full benefit that these

01:03:14.646 --> 01:03:18.219
daughters who were working their
whole lives are going to get.

01:03:18.219 --> 01:03:19.940
They're not going to take half
their husband's benefits.

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:21.384
They're going to take all their
own benefits,

01:03:21.384 --> 01:03:22.599
which are going to be a lot
higher.

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:27.329
So then there was the baby boom
generation.

01:03:27.329 --> 01:03:30.036
The baby boom generation,
far from causing the problem,

01:03:30.036 --> 01:03:31.389
has deferred the problem.
 

01:03:31.389 --> 01:03:35.585
There are all these surpluses,
because we were working so

01:03:35.585 --> 01:03:36.110
long.
 

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:37.929
I don't want to get into all
the details.

01:03:37.929 --> 01:03:44.280
People are living longer now
too, so that's another problem.

01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.139
Too much complication here.
 

01:03:47.139 --> 01:03:49.139
Okay, so what can you do about
this?

01:03:49.139 --> 01:03:57.429
Well, there are obvious things
to do, which are bad.

01:03:57.429 --> 01:03:59.449
So one thing you could do is,
you could say,

01:03:59.449 --> 01:04:02.847
if we're supposed to be paying
the average young [correction:

01:04:02.847 --> 01:04:04.659
old]
person 40 percent of the new

01:04:04.659 --> 01:04:07.458
generation's wages,
and there are only going to be

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:09.280
2 young people for every old
person,

01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.730
we could maybe shave the 40
percent down a little bit.

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:16.527
Let's make the Social Security
tax 18 percent instead of 12

01:04:16.527 --> 01:04:17.010
percent.
 

01:04:17.010 --> 01:04:23.440
So you could raise it by 6
percent.

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.722
Nobody wants to actually do
that, because an increase of 6

01:04:27.722 --> 01:04:31.929
percent in a tax rate is an
astronomical increase and you

01:04:31.929 --> 01:04:36.288
can read in the newspapers how
loath Congress is to raising

01:04:36.288 --> 01:04:37.190
taxes.
 

01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:41.914
Another obvious thing you could
do is, you could raise

01:04:41.914 --> 01:04:43.429
retirement age.
 

01:04:43.429 --> 01:04:47.307
So instead of saying it's 65,
because people will live till

01:04:47.307 --> 01:04:49.126
80,
make it start at 67,

01:04:49.126 --> 01:04:53.161
so you'll only have to pay them
for 13 years instead of 15

01:04:53.161 --> 01:04:53.800
years.
 

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.969
In this example,
18 years instead of 20 years.

01:04:56.969 --> 01:04:59.579
So you could keep raising the
retirement age.

01:04:59.579 --> 01:05:02.101
The problem with that is--not
the retirement age,

01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:04.570
the age you start collecting
Social Security.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:08.166
The problem with that of course
is that people are retiring not

01:05:08.166 --> 01:05:10.614
later and later,
even younger and younger,

01:05:10.614 --> 01:05:13.050
believe it or not,
and so you're getting this huge

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:15.554
gap between when people retire
and when they start getting

01:05:15.554 --> 01:05:16.389
Social Security.
 

01:05:16.389 --> 01:05:18.527
So there's a limit to
how--obviously you should do a

01:05:18.527 --> 01:05:20.625
little bit of that,
but there's a limit of how much

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:21.590
of that you can do.
 

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:25.219
So you need to make not just a
parametric reform,

01:05:25.219 --> 01:05:27.981
you know, like adjusting a
number, changing the tax rate a

01:05:27.981 --> 01:05:30.056
little bit,
but I believe you need a

01:05:30.056 --> 01:05:32.434
fundamental reform,
and the Republicans have

01:05:32.434 --> 01:05:33.110
proposed one.
 

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:35.159
They've said,
"Let's privatize.

01:05:35.159 --> 01:05:37.309
Let's change the whole
system."

01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:46.150
Okay, so what does it mean to
privatize?

01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:47.860
How are they going to do that?
 

01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:53.054
So what Bush had in mind was
the following:

01:05:53.054 --> 01:05:57.880
he said, "What is
privatization?

01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:59.500
It involves three things.
 

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:03.076
It's the creation of individual
accounts, so your name goes on

01:06:03.076 --> 01:06:03.369
it.
 

01:06:03.369 --> 01:06:05.849
So it's your account,
your money and no one can take

01:06:05.849 --> 01:06:06.530
it from you.
 

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:09.501
It's your money and your
money's what's going to pay for

01:06:09.501 --> 01:06:11.610
your own benefits,
so it's prefunded.

01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:14.748
So it's individual accounts and
prefunded, and it's

01:06:14.748 --> 01:06:15.880
diversification.
 

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.657
You're supposed to invest not
just in government bonds,

01:06:18.657 --> 01:06:21.539
but in the stock market,
whatever else you want."

01:06:21.539 --> 01:06:23.442
So those are the three
cornerstones,

01:06:23.442 --> 01:06:26.539
at least the way I've explained
them, of privatization.

01:06:26.539 --> 01:06:27.679
Three things that it
accomplishes.

01:06:27.679 --> 01:06:29.469
It gives you your name on the
money.

01:06:29.469 --> 01:06:30.699
It's your money.
 

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:33.139
That's the money that's going
to pay you when you get old,

01:06:33.139 --> 01:06:36.679
prefunding, and you can invest
in a wider range of assets,

01:06:36.679 --> 01:06:38.884
especially the stock market,
which is what everybody seems

01:06:38.884 --> 01:06:41.155
to want to put their money in,
or at least used to,

01:06:41.155 --> 01:06:42.650
until we had this last crash.
 

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:44.141
On the other hand,
the stock market's going up a

01:06:44.141 --> 01:06:45.760
lot, so people are getting less
nervous about it.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:51.989
So those things are different,
they're not the same.

01:06:51.989 --> 01:06:54.780
So how is Bush going to handle
this?

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.929
How would you think he was
going to do this?

01:06:56.929 --> 01:07:01.369
How could you possibly--so Bush
said, "I want to privatize.

01:07:01.369 --> 01:07:05.059
I want the 12 percent that you
pay in Social Security taxes,

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:08.260
I want 4 percent of that for
you to be able to put that in

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.460
your private account in the
stock market with your name on

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.190
it."
 

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:15.010
So Gore said,
"Well, that's ridiculous.

01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:18.559
If it's only 8 percent then,
left to give to the old people,

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:20.099
the old people are going to get
cheated,

01:07:20.099 --> 01:07:23.420
so how is Bush going to handle
that?"

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:28.849
What did you think he was going
to do?

01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:29.969
Student:
Borrow the

01:07:29.969 --> 01:07:31.179
&gt;
 

01:07:31.179 --> 01:07:31.889
Prof: Could you say that
again?

01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:33.099
It sounds right,
but I couldn't--

01:07:33.099 --> 01:07:34.472
Student:
Borrow to make up the

01:07:34.472 --> 01:07:34.929
shortfall.
 

01:07:34.929 --> 01:07:36.469
Prof: Exactly.
 

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:40.123
So I don't know what Gore was
thinking, especially since I was

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:43.059
supposedly advising Gore about
Social Security.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:47.179
But he just said in the debate,
"That's impossible.

01:07:47.179 --> 01:07:48.599
You'll just screw all the old
people."

01:07:48.599 --> 01:07:51.980
Okay, so you're supposed to be
giving 12 percent,

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:55.431
you know, 12 here,
-12 here, and then getting some

01:07:55.431 --> 01:07:56.909
return over here.
 

01:07:56.909 --> 01:07:59.525
And now Bush is saying,
"I only want to give you 8

01:07:59.525 --> 01:08:02.338
dollars,
and the other 4 you put in your

01:08:02.338 --> 01:08:05.478
Social Security account,
and then you're going to get

01:08:05.478 --> 01:08:06.969
maybe a much bigger return
here--

01:08:06.969 --> 01:08:09.030
sorry, in your stock market
account,

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:12.360
in Social Security,
so you can't take it out."

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.449
So Bush would say,
"Yes, let people put their

01:08:14.449 --> 01:08:16.921
names on it, force them to save
and contribute the whole 12

01:08:16.921 --> 01:08:17.689
dollars."
 

01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:19.805
Bush agrees that you've got to
force young people to save,

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:21.550
because they're not going to do
it otherwise.

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:23.908
So you put the 4 dollars in
their private account,

01:08:23.908 --> 01:08:26.599
but it's their name on it,
and then it grows to some huge

01:08:26.599 --> 01:08:28.896
number,
you know, 20 instead of just

01:08:28.896 --> 01:08:31.170
doubling by the time they get
old.

01:08:31.170 --> 01:08:33.810
And so that huge account is
their money.

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:38.149
So that's what Bush would say.
 

01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:40.305
So Gore would say,
"If you take these 4

01:08:40.305 --> 01:08:44.460
dollars and give it to them,
how are you going to pay the

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:48.359
old people who need the 12 right
up here?

01:08:48.359 --> 01:08:49.729
The old people are supposed to
get 12.

01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:51.890
How are you going to give them
their 12 when the young aren't

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:52.970
handing over the 12 anymore?
 

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.439
They're only handing over
8."

01:08:54.439 --> 01:08:57.506
Well, it's not like Bush and
his advisors didn't think about

01:08:57.506 --> 01:08:57.868
that.
 

01:08:57.868 --> 01:09:00.340
That would be a colossal
blunder.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.699
Of course they thought about
that.

01:09:01.699 --> 01:09:03.710
So what were they going to do?
 

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:07.175
They were going to have the
government go out and borrow the

01:09:07.175 --> 01:09:10.640
other 4, so the government
contributes 4 that it borrows.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.216
And now of course over here,
the government's going to have

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:15.420
to owe 8,
because it's got to pay back

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.136
the 4 it owed in 30 years,
at we're assuming,

01:09:18.136 --> 01:09:20.289
100 percent interest over 30
years,

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:21.399
has got to pay back the 8.
 

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:22.078
You're all with me.
 

01:09:22.078 --> 01:09:26.550
So where are they going to get
the 8?

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:30.020
Who are they going to get the 8
from?

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:30.579
What?
 

01:09:30.579 --> 01:09:31.829
Student: Taxpayers.
 

01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:32.850
Prof: Which taxpayer?
 

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:34.310
Student: All of them.
 

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:36.060
Prof: Everybody.
 

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.390
Really?
 

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:38.792
Student:
The same people who are paying

01:09:38.792 --> 01:09:39.479
the Social Security.
 

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.130
Prof: Okay, these people.
 

01:09:41.130 --> 01:09:45.211
So if you chose to take 4 of
your dollars out of Social

01:09:45.211 --> 01:09:49.520
Security and put it into your
Social Security stock market

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.710
trust fund,
your personal trust fund,

01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:55.697
the deal is,
you have to pay the interest at

01:09:55.697 --> 01:09:56.970
the end of 30 years.
 

01:09:56.970 --> 01:10:01.109
So this 8 comes out of your 20.
 

01:10:01.109 --> 01:10:04.770
So these people pay back the 8.
 

01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:07.529
So basically,
to say it in a different way,

01:10:07.529 --> 01:10:10.729
the way you get to invest in
the stock market,

01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:13.319
according to the Bush
privatization rules,

01:10:13.319 --> 01:10:16.411
is these people effectively,
they're giving the 12 dollars

01:10:16.411 --> 01:10:19.082
anyway to the old,
but they get to borrow 4

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:22.788
dollars and put it in their
private stock market account.

01:10:22.788 --> 01:10:25.279
And then they have to pay back
the amount they borrowed with

01:10:25.279 --> 01:10:26.250
interest, which is 8.
 

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:30.194
But if the stock market does
better than the interest rate,

01:10:30.194 --> 01:10:32.779
then of course they make out
better.

01:10:32.779 --> 01:10:37.100
They get 20 - 8, which is 12.
 

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.170
Okay, so is that clear how he
did it?

01:10:39.170 --> 01:10:41.328
So it's not a logical
impossibility.

01:10:41.328 --> 01:10:43.069
The problem with the Bush plan,
of course,

01:10:43.069 --> 01:10:46.828
is that if the money you put in
the stock market earns the same

01:10:46.828 --> 01:10:49.979
rate of return that you would
have gotten anyway,

01:10:49.979 --> 01:10:52.788
if the stock market earns the
same rate of return,

01:10:52.788 --> 01:10:55.420
100 percent over all those
years as the bond market,

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:58.625
then this private stash you
have just goes back to paying

01:10:58.625 --> 01:11:02.115
off the government debt and you
haven't gained anything in the

01:11:02.115 --> 01:11:03.090
stock market.
 

01:11:03.090 --> 01:11:05.685
You get the same Social
Security benefits you would have

01:11:05.685 --> 01:11:06.300
had anyway.
 

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.222
So these guys who opt into the
privatization program,

01:11:09.222 --> 01:11:10.908
let me repeat the Bush plan.
 

01:11:10.908 --> 01:11:13.529
If you opt into the
privatization program,

01:11:13.529 --> 01:11:16.917
you effectively do everything
you did before in Social

01:11:16.917 --> 01:11:17.750
Security.
 

01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:19.689
You pay your taxes that go to
the old people.

01:11:19.689 --> 01:11:21.988
You get the benefits just like
you did before,

01:11:21.988 --> 01:11:24.435
but on top of it,
you have the right to borrow 4

01:11:24.435 --> 01:11:27.259
dollars from the government,
invest it in stocks,

01:11:27.259 --> 01:11:29.966
and then at the end,
you have to pay back the

01:11:29.966 --> 01:11:32.488
government out of your stock
market return.

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:35.234
So you're betting on whether
the stock market is going to do

01:11:35.234 --> 01:11:36.630
better than the bond market.
 

01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:39.010
That's effectively what the
plan was.

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:43.380
Okay, so it's not a logical
impossibility like Gore said.

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.420
On the other hand,
if you don't think the stock

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.548
market's going to do better than
the bond market,

01:11:47.548 --> 01:11:49.189
you could end up being worse
off.

01:11:49.189 --> 01:11:51.363
You could put in 4 dollars
here, get only 6,

01:11:51.363 --> 01:11:53.689
and then you'd have to owe the
government 8.

01:11:53.689 --> 01:11:55.970
Where's the government going to
get the other 2 dollars from?

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:58.149
It's going to reduce your
Social Security contributions

01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:59.359
[correction: benefits]
by 2.

01:11:59.359 --> 01:12:01.210
So that's the government plan.
 

01:12:01.210 --> 01:12:04.550
So in the problem set,
I gave you three problems.

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:05.908
You can only do two of them now.
 

01:12:05.908 --> 01:12:08.158
The last one I didn't get far
enough to have you do.

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:11.976
So just do two of them,
and I'm going to give my own

01:12:11.976 --> 01:12:15.720
plan next time and also do a
little mathematics.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.983
It's going to turn out that
it's quite interesting to math

01:12:18.983 --> 01:12:20.300
this up a little bit.
 

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:25.000

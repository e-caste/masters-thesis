00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.005
Professor John Rogers:
It's not until the fourth

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:09.145
book of Paradise Lost
that finally we see

00:00:09.145 --> 00:00:12.886
represented before us the
paradise whose imminent loss is

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:15.960
heralded so grandly in the
poem's title.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.580
Milton's task here is a
difficult one.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.850
His task is to represent
unfallen Eden,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.325
Eden before the Fall,
to represent this unfallen Eden

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:30.230
to a fallen audience of the
1660s from his own perspective

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.620
as a fallen man himself and as a
fallen poet.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.575
Milton is self-conscious about
this predicament and continually

00:00:40.575 --> 00:00:46.243
confronting the challenge posed
by this essentially artistic

00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:49.213
predicament.
But the predicament,

00:00:49.213 --> 00:00:51.793
although it is this,
is not simply an

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:55.639
epistemological quandary,
a problem about knowledge --

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:59.120
how can fallen man know anything
about unfallen man?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.007
There's more riding on this
question than merely this

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:07.493
question of how we can possibly
know what it was like in this

00:01:07.493 --> 00:01:10.260
unknowable state before the
Fall.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.775
It's more important than simply
that because everything is

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:18.974
riding on Milton's success of
his representation of an

00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:21.543
unfallen Eden.
I think the theodicy,

00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:24.808
the success of Milton's attempt
to justify the ways of God to

00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:27.804
men,
is hanging to some degree on

00:01:27.804 --> 00:01:32.659
the success of his
representation of unfallen-ness,

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.355
and this is why:
because only if we can truly

00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:41.647
see paradise as unfallen can we
really believe that Adam and Eve

00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:46.518
were in fact perfectly capable
of exercising their unfallen

00:01:46.518 --> 00:01:51.054
wills freely when confronted
with the temptation of the

00:01:51.054 --> 00:01:54.282
fruit.
Even so much as a hint of

00:01:54.282 --> 00:01:59.373
fallen-ness in a representation
of Eden threatens to indict God

00:01:59.373 --> 00:02:02.739
and threatens to impugn God's
justice.

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:07.402
Because God can be said to have
caused the Fall if he can be

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:11.749
seen to have insinuated into
paradise even the slightest

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.808
propensity to fallen-ness,
the question is an important

00:02:15.808 --> 00:02:18.988
one.
So to justify fully the ways of

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:23.073
God, this fallen poet has to
represent to us,

00:02:23.073 --> 00:02:27.530
the fallen audience,
an Eden that is unmistakably

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.860
unfallen.
It's a huge challenge.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.916
Though unfallen Eden can't be
like anything we know,

00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:41.767
it has to be utterly other from
everything that we're familiar

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:44.905
with because,
of course, everything that

00:02:44.905 --> 00:02:48.476
we're familiar with is
fallen.One of the dominant

00:02:48.476 --> 00:02:52.115
rhetorical strategies of the
first two books has to be

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:55.000
inverted to some degree in Book
Four.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.540
We have spent some time talking
about the similes,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.599
especially the similes at the
beginning of Milton's poem,

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.199
and the simile used initially
in Paradise Lost at some

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:09.953
important junctures in Book Four
especially is transformed into

00:03:09.953 --> 00:03:13.020
what we can think of as a
dissimile.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.970
I'm not actually sure that
that's a real rhetorical term;

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.297
I didn't make it up.
In any case,

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:23.090
we'll use it for lack of a
better word.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.753
So a simile,
a positive simile,

00:03:24.753 --> 00:03:27.250
involves the -- you know what
this is like.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.899
It involves a construction that
"X is like Y," and a dissimile

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:36.176
would propose the opposite,
that "X is unlike Y."I'm

00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:40.752
going to ask you to turn to the
most famous of these dissimiles

00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:44.687
in Paradise Lost.
This is at line 268 of Book

00:03:44.687 --> 00:03:48.020
Four.
It's page 283 and 284 in the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.463
Hughes.
Milton is forced to

00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.389
describee -- what else can he
do?

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:55.587
He's forced to describe
paradise in terms of all the

00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:58.220
things that Eden is not so he
tells us:

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.599
Not that fair fieldOf
Enna…

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.340
…[N]or that
sweet Grove

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.090
Of Daphne by Orontes…
…

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.360
[N]or that Nyseian
Isle…

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.360
I'm skipping here obviously --
and so forth.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.229
It's quite a catalog of things
that Eden is not like.

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:16.166
The rhetorical mode is
necessarily one of negation

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:21.908
because of the epistemological
and artistic problem of the

00:04:21.908 --> 00:04:27.448
fallen representation of
unfallen-ness.Look a little

00:04:27.448 --> 00:04:31.255
further up at line 233.
This is, I think,

00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:34.275
where the problem of a fallen
representation of an unfallen

00:04:34.275 --> 00:04:36.410
state actually really comes to a
head.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.490
Milton's describing here the
four rivers of Eden,

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.716
line 233:
And now divided into four

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:47.764
main Streams,
Run divers, wand'ring many a

00:04:47.764 --> 00:04:50.855
famous Realm
And Country whereof here needs

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:53.820
no account,
But rather to tell how,

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.540
if Art could tell,
How from that Sapphire Fount

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.080
the crisped Brooks,
Rolling on Orient Pearl and

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.976
sands of Gold,
With mazy error under pendant

00:05:04.976 --> 00:05:07.936
shades
Ran Nectar, visiting each

00:05:07.936 --> 00:05:11.971
plant, and fed
Flow'rs worthy of Paradise

00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:15.903
which not nice Art
In Beds and curious Knots,

00:05:15.903 --> 00:05:19.792
but Nature boon
Pour'd forth profuse on Hill

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:25.400
and Dale and Plain…
The flowers of paradise are

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.800
poured forth in Eden not by a
nice or a fastidious gardener,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.455
by fastidious artifice.
There's nothing fussy about

00:05:34.455 --> 00:05:36.793
this garden.
Its bounteous Nature herself

00:05:36.793 --> 00:05:39.440
who has poured forth all this
profuseness.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.283
Eden is free of any artifice,
but this lack of art in Eden,

00:05:44.283 --> 00:05:49.209
of course, only accentuates the
problem that the poet has no

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:53.333
choice but to face.
The poet is under a pressure to

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:57.029
describe with what is,
of course, his poetic art that

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.730
which is essentially
indescribable.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.212
Milton lets us know the
problem, "if Art could tell,"

00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:05.220
and that phrase "if Art could
tell" clearly implies that art,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.979
even Milton's art,
can't tell us what Eden was

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.490
like, that Milton's art can't
represent an unfallen,

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.505
non-artificial world with the
instruments and the tools of

00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:22.641
fallen artificial
language.The impossibility

00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:26.772
that he's facing,
I think, is nowhere so apparent

00:06:26.772 --> 00:06:30.307
as it is here in this
description of "the crisped

00:06:30.307 --> 00:06:34.652
Brooks" of paradise "rolling /
with mazy error under pendant

00:06:34.652 --> 00:06:36.630
shades."
Now of course,

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.566
"error" is one of the
most resonant words in the

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:43.596
entire poem.
Error is the moral category,

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:46.986
or we can think of it as the
theological category,

00:06:46.986 --> 00:06:51.137
most often applied to the Fall
and to Adam and Eve's eventual

00:06:51.137 --> 00:06:54.282
sin.
We might very well wonder why

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:58.980
it is that error has crept into
Eden before the Fall.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.873
Its presence here on some level
could be seen to doom the garden

00:07:04.873 --> 00:07:07.666
in advance,
could be seen as some kind of

00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:10.439
evidence of a degree of
fallen-ness in this unfallen

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:13.225
Eden.But Milton,
of course, is using the word

00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:17.015
"error" in a special sense.
He's doing what he does so

00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:22.306
often: he employs a word solely
to evoke its etymological root

00:07:22.306 --> 00:07:26.990
sense, which in this case simply
means "wandering."

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.420
The brook here is quite simply
not flowing straight.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.311
It's moving,
it's divagating,

00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:37.339
and it's moving in a curvaceous
form.

00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:41.651
Milton is working consciously
to exclude the moral

00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:46.578
significance that this word
"error" had acquired later in

00:07:46.578 --> 00:07:51.165
its etymological history.
He's attempting to block out

00:07:51.165 --> 00:07:54.218
the meaning of this word that
had crept in,

00:07:54.218 --> 00:07:58.052
as it were, after the Fall.
There's actually a wonderful

00:07:58.052 --> 00:08:01.180
book that looks brilliantly at
just this phenomenon.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.050
It's called Milton's Grand
Style by the great critic

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.706
Christopher Ricks,
and in that book Ricks argues

00:08:09.706 --> 00:08:13.456
for the self-consciousness
behind Milton's employment of

00:08:13.456 --> 00:08:17.751
the original etymological sense
of some of the most loaded words

00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:21.573
in the poem.
So Milton will remind us of the

00:08:21.573 --> 00:08:25.439
Fall with his use of such a word
as "error,"

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:29.076
but at the same time,
of course, he's attempting to

00:08:29.076 --> 00:08:33.222
create in us -- and it's a
remarkable move -- to create in

00:08:33.222 --> 00:08:37.732
us a memory for a time in which
a word like "error" had not yet

00:08:37.732 --> 00:08:42.460
been infected by its morally
pejorative modern connotation.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.677
He's reminding us of a time in
which there was no such thing as

00:08:46.677 --> 00:08:48.781
moral error,
not that we can be reminded

00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:50.913
because, of course,
we can't remember -- we weren't

00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:53.710
around;
but it's as if a memory is

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:58.360
being instilled in us by means
of Milton's poetry.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.702
He condenses into a single word
what is essentially the entire

00:09:03.702 --> 00:09:08.168
poetic problem besetting the
description of unfallen

00:09:08.168 --> 00:09:11.848
Eden.Milton,
too, manages with a word like

00:09:11.848 --> 00:09:15.571
this to remind us that we're
only seeing the garden after

00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:18.763
Satan has overleaped its
boundaries and has begun

00:09:18.763 --> 00:09:22.131
sneaking around.
We're given no description,

00:09:22.131 --> 00:09:26.511
you'll note -- we're given no
description of Eden until after

00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:30.819
the point in the story in which
Satan has already entered or

00:09:30.819 --> 00:09:33.740
crossed the boundaries of
paradise.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.926
Look at line 285.
This is page 285 in the

00:09:37.926 --> 00:09:42.179
Hughes. Milton locates
that geographical spot on the

00:09:42.179 --> 00:09:44.820
globe believed to have been
Eden,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:49.077
but he does that only to remind
us that everything that we are

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:53.196
seeing is precisely what Satan
is seeing: "where the Fiend /

00:09:53.196 --> 00:09:58.861
Saw undelighted all delight,
all kind / Of Creatures new to

00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:03.034
sight and strange."
Satan's presence is important

00:10:03.034 --> 00:10:07.000
here because he reminds us that
we, too, were in a position of

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.340
seeing "undelighted all
delight."

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.616
We share his pained alienation
from the innocence of the

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:17.893
garden.Nowhere is the
problem of representation more

00:10:17.893 --> 00:10:22.869
urgent and more troubled than in
the first view that we are given

00:10:22.869 --> 00:10:26.305
of Adam and Eve.
There is an extraordinary

00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:30.034
pressure on Milton as he
describes the condition of the

00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:33.236
unfallen Adam and Eve,
and that pressure would

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:36.126
unquestionably,
I think, have been felt by the

00:10:36.126 --> 00:10:39.705
poem's original readers.
Milton's description of Adam

00:10:39.705 --> 00:10:43.527
and Eve -- and in this respect
it is like what I take to be

00:10:43.527 --> 00:10:47.614
nearly every seventeenth-century
description of Adam and Eve --

00:10:47.614 --> 00:10:50.580
it is necessarily a political
statement.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:54.959
It's the account of the first
society, and as an account of

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:58.299
the first society,
Milton's Eden has to establish

00:10:58.299 --> 00:11:01.470
something like the ideal against
which all current,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.881
all fallen, societies have to
be judged.So in the

00:11:04.881 --> 00:11:08.357
seventeenth century a
description of man and the state

00:11:08.357 --> 00:11:12.359
of nature before the onset of
any kind of civil government was

00:11:12.359 --> 00:11:16.820
an essential component of just
about any political philosophy.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.492
You couldn't forward a
political vision without

00:11:20.492 --> 00:11:25.203
forwarding at the same time an
image of a society before the

00:11:25.203 --> 00:11:28.864
onset of government.
The most important political

00:11:28.864 --> 00:11:31.667
philosopher of
mid-seventeenth-century England

00:11:31.667 --> 00:11:34.096
is Milton's slightly older
contemporary,

00:11:34.096 --> 00:11:37.251
Thomas Hobbes.
He had founded his vision of

00:11:37.251 --> 00:11:41.054
politics, which was a decidedly
authoritarian vision of

00:11:41.054 --> 00:11:44.863
politics,
on just such an account of a

00:11:44.863 --> 00:11:49.519
nearly unrecoverable,
un-rememberable past.

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:53.554
In Hobbes' Leviathan,
Hobbes conjures an image of

00:11:53.554 --> 00:11:57.263
the original man in the state of
nature that serves as the

00:11:57.263 --> 00:12:01.103
foundation for his political
wisdom for his truly outrageous

00:12:01.103 --> 00:12:04.942
thesis that the only viable
political institution is that of

00:12:04.942 --> 00:12:10.175
an absolutist monarchy.
I say it's outrageous perhaps

00:12:10.175 --> 00:12:14.500
because it's so incredibly
compelling.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.329
It's very hard not to be
converted to a terrifying form

00:12:18.329 --> 00:12:21.804
of authoritarianism when you
read Hobbes' ironclad

00:12:21.804 --> 00:12:26.060
prose.In the famous chapter
thirteen of the first book of

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:30.386
Leviathan -- this was in
the packet -- Hobbes describes

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:34.499
the riotous mayhem constitutive
of life before the onset of

00:12:34.499 --> 00:12:38.288
political institutions,
and so interestingly and

00:12:38.288 --> 00:12:41.546
importantly here Hobbes is
forwarding a kind of secular

00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:43.591
argument.
This isn't theological,

00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:47.097
and so he doesn't return us to
the Genesis account of Adam and

00:12:47.097 --> 00:12:49.329
Eve.
His state of nature,

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:53.171
he tells us,
is just like the one inhabited

00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:58.019
-- it's America -- by the
savages of the Americas;

00:12:58.019 --> 00:13:01.936
but the purpose of the
Hobbesian account is directly

00:13:01.936 --> 00:13:05.084
analogous, I think,
to Milton's purpose in

00:13:05.084 --> 00:13:09.386
describing Eden.
For Hobbes, men in the state of

00:13:09.386 --> 00:13:13.107
nature are all equal.
The state of nature is an

00:13:13.107 --> 00:13:16.270
egalitarian one,
and Hobbes does everything he

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:19.995
can do -- it's egalitarian even
with respect to sex --

00:13:19.995 --> 00:13:23.791
everything he can do to
demonstrate the dangers of this

00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:27.916
natural egalitarianism.
Because, Hobbes tells us,

00:13:27.916 --> 00:13:32.755
all men and women were created
equal, there's no authority to

00:13:32.755 --> 00:13:36.490
keep them in place.
There's no authority to keep

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.549
them from what would naturally
just be a perpetual state of

00:13:40.549 --> 00:13:43.505
strife.
Hobbes explains in chapter

00:13:43.505 --> 00:13:46.312
thirteen:
[W]ithout a common power

00:13:46.312 --> 00:13:49.399
[and by "common power" he means
a king, a prince,

00:13:49.399 --> 00:13:54.993
a tyrant -- it doesn't matter,
someone], man is in the state

00:13:54.993 --> 00:13:59.092
of war…
and such a war as is of every

00:13:59.092 --> 00:14:02.398
man against every man.
[And he continues.]

00:14:02.398 --> 00:14:04.782
…And the life of [the
natural]

00:14:04.782 --> 00:14:08.159
man [and this is surely the
most famous and the most

00:14:08.159 --> 00:14:11.139
glorious sentence in all of
Hobbes' remarkable

00:14:11.139 --> 00:14:13.590
Leviathan]
is solitary,

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:20.240
poor, nasty,
brutish, and short.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.006
For Hobbes, the egalitarianism
established in nature is

00:14:23.006 --> 00:14:26.100
obviously unsatisfactory;
it has to be corrected.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.684
We have to construct some kind
of governmental structure,

00:14:29.684 --> 00:14:33.590
a polity, whereby we submit
ourselves to an absolute ruler,

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.769
a monarch or a tyrant -- it
doesn't matter.

00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:40.614
Hobbes' Leviathan must
have been deeply troubling to

00:14:40.614 --> 00:14:44.459
Milton who devoted so much of
his career to the critique of

00:14:44.459 --> 00:14:47.906
just the kind of absolutist
government that Hobbes is

00:14:47.906 --> 00:14:50.755
championing.
I think there are a lot of

00:14:50.755 --> 00:14:54.194
signs in Paradise Lost
that Milton is countering

00:14:54.194 --> 00:14:57.489
his great contemporary,
Thomas Hobbes.Now one of

00:14:57.489 --> 00:15:01.177
the advantages of writing about
Eden was that his description of

00:15:01.177 --> 00:15:03.259
paradise,
as I've suggested,

00:15:03.259 --> 00:15:07.167
was something like an implicit
model for a political

00:15:07.167 --> 00:15:10.080
philosophy,
certainly, in Milton's hands.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.813
Hobbes had used his description
of the state of men in the state

00:15:14.813 --> 00:15:18.120
of nature to forward his
authoritarianism,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.393
and so Milton has to use his
description of the first couple

00:15:21.393 --> 00:15:24.526
to forward his cause,
which is essentially that of

00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:28.240
republicanism or some kind of
non-monarchic government.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.774
Adam and Eve have to be able to
form a successful society alone,

00:15:33.774 --> 00:15:36.850
a successful polity on their
own,

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.501
without the dictatorial
intervention of any sovereign

00:15:39.501 --> 00:15:42.030
power.
This is crucial for what Milton

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.860
needs to be able to argue
politically.So what exactly

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.570
are Milton's politics?
It's been a while since we

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.997
visited this topic.
We haven't really discussed

00:15:52.997 --> 00:15:56.072
Milton's politics since we
looked at the 1644

00:15:56.072 --> 00:15:58.977
Areopagitica,
 and a lot,

00:15:58.977 --> 00:16:01.860
I'm sad to say,
has changed since then.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.766
In Areopagitica we saw
Milton affirm what was

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:07.899
essentially the general equality
of all human beings.

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:11.987
This was an implicit argument
that all individuals have been

00:16:11.987 --> 00:16:15.798
endowed by God with reason and
that they are all equally

00:16:15.798 --> 00:16:19.470
capable of choosing and
reasoning for themselves;

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.266
but in the 1650s Milton had
grown considerably less

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:28.049
optimistic in his sense of the
equality of all men and women.

00:16:28.049 --> 00:16:31.527
The average individual in
England for Milton at this point

00:16:31.527 --> 00:16:34.638
didn't in fact seem to be
endowed with quite as much

00:16:34.638 --> 00:16:36.529
[laughs]
reason and capacity for

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:40.190
rational choice as Milton felt
that he was capable of,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.665
or as Milton felt that he and
his fellow Puritan

00:16:43.665 --> 00:16:49.054
revolutionaries were capable of.
So many of Milton's backsliding

00:16:49.054 --> 00:16:54.248
countrymen wanted their king
back, a devastating cultural

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:59.348
fact for Milton.And so
Milton began to develop a new

00:16:59.348 --> 00:17:03.236
political philosophy.
It was something like an

00:17:03.236 --> 00:17:06.621
aristocratic philosophy of
political society that places

00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:08.410
superior,
more rational,

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:12.537
more spiritually minded beings,
people like John Milton,

00:17:12.537 --> 00:17:17.039
at the top of the society and
they are necessarily above less

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:19.313
rational,
less excellent,

00:17:19.313 --> 00:17:24.042
less spiritually minded beings
who are obviously in a lower

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:27.103
stratum.
Milton's later political

00:17:27.103 --> 00:17:32.510
philosophy sketches something
like almost a natural hierarchy

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:37.918
in which the rational elite are
in a position to guide and to

00:17:37.918 --> 00:17:43.236
offer some sort of authoritative
wisdom to the less rational

00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:48.205
members of the society.
These less rational members

00:17:48.205 --> 00:17:53.322
ideally, willingly yield to the
superior wisdom and the reason

00:17:53.322 --> 00:17:57.155
of the rational elite.
It seems to be this later

00:17:57.155 --> 00:18:01.319
vision of a kind of naturally
hierarchical society that forms

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:06.030
the basis for the first polity,
which is that of Adam and Eve

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.494
in Milton's Eden.
It goes without saying that the

00:18:09.494 --> 00:18:12.467
union of Adam and Eve in
Milton's paradise is a

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:15.829
patriarchal one and the
hierarchical division between

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:19.837
superior and inferior creatures
has been marked almost entirely

00:18:19.837 --> 00:18:23.910
or exclusively along the lines
of gender.Now Milton,

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.323
as you know,
has been reviled for his

00:18:27.323 --> 00:18:32.349
unrepentant patriarchalization
of the first couple.

00:18:32.349 --> 00:18:36.393
Look at line 299,
one of the most famous lines in

00:18:36.393 --> 00:18:39.720
the poem.
This is the middle of page 285

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.612
of the Hughes.
Milton's talking about the

00:18:43.612 --> 00:18:47.944
purpose of Adam and Eve's
creation: "hee for God only,

00:18:47.944 --> 00:18:53.978
shee for God in him..."
This is without question a

00:18:53.978 --> 00:18:59.240
sexist vision of the first
polity.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.700
We can say that,
I think, without much

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.759
hesitation, but it would be
almost criminal,

00:19:04.759 --> 00:19:08.533
and I really believe this,
to say that Milton's sexism is

00:19:08.533 --> 00:19:10.687
simplistic.
It is so complex,

00:19:10.687 --> 00:19:14.893
in fact, that Milton has
included in his poem a number of

00:19:14.893 --> 00:19:18.799
competing ways to think about
this first society.

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:22.771
We actually have passionately
expressed before us in

00:19:22.771 --> 00:19:25.730
Paradise Lost the old
Milton,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.895
the younger,
much more liberal Milton --

00:19:27.895 --> 00:19:31.281
that radical egalitarianism that
he was able so forcefully and

00:19:31.281 --> 00:19:33.779
compellingly to voice in
Areopagitica.

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:36.430
That voice is audible in
Paradise Lost,

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.431
but we also,
of course, have the later

00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:41.190
Milton, the believer in a
hierarchical society.

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.178
You can hear these
contradictions at work in the

00:19:44.178 --> 00:19:46.849
poem's description of this first
polity,

00:19:46.849 --> 00:19:51.169
the union of Adam and
Eve.Look a little further up

00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:56.519
on page 285.
This is line 288: 

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:59.920
Two of far nobler shape
erect and tall,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:02.289
Godlike erect,
with native Honor clad

00:20:02.289 --> 00:20:06.059
In naked Majesty seem'd Lords
of all,

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:08.869
And worthy seem'd,
for in thir looks Divine

00:20:08.869 --> 00:20:11.460
The image of thir glorious
Maker shone,

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.519
Truth, Wisdome,
Sanctitude severe and pure,

00:20:15.519 --> 00:20:19.190
Severe, but in true filial
freedom plac't;

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:24.009
Whence true autority in
men.

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:29.526
Now, it certainly strikes me to
be the case that this first view

00:20:29.526 --> 00:20:34.079
that we get of Adam and Eve is
an egalitarian one.

00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:38.363
In their naked majesty they are
both described as "Lords of

00:20:38.363 --> 00:20:43.016
all," but their seeming equality
is a source of no small anxiety

00:20:43.016 --> 00:20:45.911
to Milton;
and so we are told almost

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.740
immediately he can't take it
anymore.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.695
We're told: "though both / Not
equal, as thir sex not equal

00:20:53.695 --> 00:20:56.261
seem'd."
Well, of course up to this

00:20:56.261 --> 00:20:58.500
point their sex did "equal
seem."

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.395
It's here that Milton places an
enormous amount of weight on

00:21:02.395 --> 00:21:06.225
this word "seem'd," one of the
most important words in Book

00:21:06.225 --> 00:21:12.309
Four.
"Seem'd" not equal to whom?

00:21:12.309 --> 00:21:16.255
The idea of seeming is
always with respect to a

00:21:16.255 --> 00:21:20.349
perceiver, someone to whom
something seems to be this or

00:21:20.349 --> 00:21:22.993
that.
It's with this word "seem'd"

00:21:22.993 --> 00:21:26.588
that we're reintroduced to the
subject of the fallen

00:21:26.588 --> 00:21:30.817
perspective on an unfallen scene
and reminded that we are not

00:21:30.817 --> 00:21:35.047
granted anything like a purview
of Eden until after Satan has

00:21:35.047 --> 00:21:38.525
entered the garden.
This description of Eden in

00:21:38.525 --> 00:21:41.084
Book Four has,
in fact, merely been tracing

00:21:41.084 --> 00:21:43.578
Satan's steps,
and this description of Adam

00:21:43.578 --> 00:21:46.496
and Eve merely emerges now
because this is the scene that

00:21:46.496 --> 00:21:49.569
Satan happens now to be looking
at.Look at line 285.

00:21:49.569 --> 00:21:52.667
I have already referred to
these lines: "where the Fiend /

00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:55.709
Saw undelighted all delight,
all kind of living Creatures

00:21:55.709 --> 00:21:59.296
new to sight and strange."
Then you have a colon,

00:21:59.296 --> 00:22:04.541
and then after the colon falls
this long description of Adam

00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:06.559
and Eve.
It's possible,

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:10.643
it's just possible to read the
entire description of the

00:22:10.643 --> 00:22:15.098
sexually hierarchized Adam and
Eve as an account in something

00:22:15.098 --> 00:22:19.480
like indirect discourse of
Satan's fallen perspective.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.874
If their sex "not equal
seem'd," it's possible that

00:22:22.874 --> 00:22:25.589
their sex "not equal seem'd" to
Satan.

00:22:25.589 --> 00:22:28.746
It's Satan, of course -- we
know this already to be the case

00:22:28.746 --> 00:22:31.529
-- who is more concerned than
any of the other poem's

00:22:31.529 --> 00:22:33.829
characters with problems of
inequality,

00:22:33.829 --> 00:22:38.075
so this is naturally going to
be the predisposition,

00:22:38.075 --> 00:22:42.570
the set of concerns that he
brings to his vision of any

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.150
polity.It's a fascinating
question,

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:50.777
and there's actually a
considerable debate raging -- if

00:22:50.777 --> 00:22:54.805
you can say that,
a Miltonist rage -- there is a

00:22:54.805 --> 00:22:59.090
debate among Miltonists on just
this question,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.131
and it's an interesting one.
Milton's position at the head

00:23:02.131 --> 00:23:05.140
of the English literary canon is
often associated,

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.468
or has been since the late
‘70s -- or maybe,

00:23:08.468 --> 00:23:12.477
actually, since Virginia Woolf
was writing in the ‘20s

00:23:12.477 --> 00:23:16.213
and ‘30s -- is often
associated with his insistent

00:23:16.213 --> 00:23:19.950
positioning of Adam over Eve in
Paradise Lost.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:24.918
Some participants in the
debates about the validity of

00:23:24.918 --> 00:23:30.234
the Western literary canon have
imagined the effects of sexism

00:23:30.234 --> 00:23:35.202
in our society and have imagined
eradicating sexism in our

00:23:35.202 --> 00:23:40.171
society by eradicating from
college reading lists a sexist

00:23:40.171 --> 00:23:43.312
poet like Milton.
That argument is made,

00:23:43.312 --> 00:23:45.586
it's still forwarded today,
and it's an argument that

00:23:45.586 --> 00:23:47.369
poses,
as you can imagine,

00:23:47.369 --> 00:23:50.441
an understandable threat to
people like me,

00:23:50.441 --> 00:23:54.105
admirers of this poet.
You can imagine the number of

00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:57.777
Miltonists -- it was really
quite remarkable -- who rallied

00:23:57.777 --> 00:24:01.259
around the textual suggestion
that when Milton says,

00:24:01.259 --> 00:24:03.919
"hee for God only,
shee for God in him," he

00:24:03.919 --> 00:24:07.147
doesn't really mean it.I
think it was in the mid

00:24:07.147 --> 00:24:09.047
‘80s that a critic first

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:14.716
hit on the theory that all of
the description of Adam and Eve

00:24:14.716 --> 00:24:18.289
could be seen as merely an
exfoliation of Satan's

00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:22.210
perspective.
There was tremendous joy and

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:27.279
excitement in the Milton
community once that idea had

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:30.469
been floated.
It's as if the narrator is just

00:24:30.469 --> 00:24:33.045
reproducing for us the
hierarchical imagination of

00:24:33.045 --> 00:24:36.200
Satan whose perspective on Adam
and Eve is the one that we're

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.753
getting at the moment.
So we're able to say to

00:24:39.753 --> 00:24:45.502
ourselves rather comfortably and
complacently that Milton isn't

00:24:45.502 --> 00:24:51.160
telling us that the social
organization of Eden is sexist.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:57.117
Milton is telling us that Satan
is sexist and that patriarchy is

00:24:57.117 --> 00:25:02.696
essentially satanic rather than
Miltonic.I get depressed

00:25:02.696 --> 00:25:07.329
when I think of critical
positions like this,

00:25:07.329 --> 00:25:11.169
whether you have the extreme
position of Milton as the

00:25:11.169 --> 00:25:14.936
inventor and the prime
perpetrator of misogyny on the

00:25:14.936 --> 00:25:19.283
one hand or the counter-vision
of Milton as an early feminist

00:25:19.283 --> 00:25:22.193
on the other.
The case is obviously more

00:25:22.193 --> 00:25:25.259
complicated than that,
and it's more interesting than

00:25:25.259 --> 00:25:28.560
that because it's not at all
clear -- just in the passage

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.685
that we're looking at -- it's
not clear whose voice is

00:25:31.685 --> 00:25:35.341
actually authorizing these lines
that establish the patriarchal

00:25:35.341 --> 00:25:39.414
parameters of unfallen society.
Without a doubt we have the

00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:42.145
narrator speaking here,
and presumably he is

00:25:42.145 --> 00:25:46.019
representing something like the
official line of the poem,

00:25:46.019 --> 00:25:49.533
but Milton does in fact go out
of his way to situate the entire

00:25:49.533 --> 00:25:52.309
scene as an elaboration of
Satan's perspective.

00:25:52.309 --> 00:25:55.719
Both of these things are true,
and this passage,

00:25:55.719 --> 00:26:00.000
which has absolutely everything
to do with what Milton calls

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.119
establishing the true authority
of men,

00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:05.359
refuses to establish its own
authority.

00:26:05.359 --> 00:26:11.643
It refuses to announce itself
as the product either of the

00:26:11.643 --> 00:26:16.891
poem's narrator or of Satan.
It's a moment of textual

00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:21.423
instability, and I think it
reflects the larger political

00:26:21.423 --> 00:26:25.873
instability that is threatening
Eden and threatening the

00:26:25.873 --> 00:26:29.919
relation between Adam and
Eve.It's worth asking

00:26:29.919 --> 00:26:34.774
ourselves: what is it about Adam
and Eve that makes them seem

00:26:34.774 --> 00:26:37.811
unequal?
Look at line 297:

00:26:37.811 --> 00:26:41.624
"for contemplation hee and
valor form'd,

00:26:41.624 --> 00:26:46.610
/ For softness shee and sweet
attractive Grace."

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.707
Now how do we know this?
We know it by their physical

00:26:49.707 --> 00:26:52.563
differences.
We know it by the appearance of

00:26:52.563 --> 00:26:55.890
their anatomies and,
more precisely than that,

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:02.499
we know that they are different
and unequal by means of our

00:27:02.499 --> 00:27:07.160
perception of their hair:
His fair large Front and

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:09.740
Eye sublime declar'd
Absolute rule;

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.781
and Hyacinthine Locks
Round from his parted forelock

00:27:13.781 --> 00:27:17.856
manly hung
Clust'ring, but not beneath his

00:27:17.856 --> 00:27:21.021
shoulders broad.
Milton [laughs]

00:27:21.021 --> 00:27:24.301
did wear his hair long but he
wants us to know [laughs]

00:27:24.301 --> 00:27:26.670
-- that's part of the
historical record,

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:29.039
and he was very pleased with
that;

00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:32.160
but he always wants us to know
that it wasn't too long.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:38.188
It's the same with Adam who
wears his hair unusually long

00:27:38.188 --> 00:27:42.637
but not indecorously long:
Round from his parted

00:27:42.637 --> 00:27:45.350
forelock manly hung
Clust'ring, but not beneath his

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:49.413
shoulders broad:
Shee as a vail down to the

00:27:49.413 --> 00:27:52.727
slender waist
Her unadorned golden tresses

00:27:52.727 --> 00:27:54.066
wore
Disshevell'd,

00:27:54.066 --> 00:27:59.106
but in wanton ringlets wav'd
As the Vine curles her

00:27:59.106 --> 00:28:04.940
tendrils, which impli'd
Subjection…

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.385
Now, I'll bet that we can all
agree that a description of

00:28:09.385 --> 00:28:13.990
their hair is not what we were
expecting at this moment.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:19.044
Supporters of patriarchy or of
the superiority of men have

00:28:19.044 --> 00:28:22.680
always enlisted anatomical
differences,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.122
the anatomical differences
between the sexes,

00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:31.868
as proof of man's rightful
ability to subject or

00:28:31.868 --> 00:28:35.759
subordinate woman.
In fact, central to the

00:28:35.759 --> 00:28:38.736
patriarchal prejudice,
as you can imagine,

00:28:38.736 --> 00:28:43.020
was what often seems to be the
strength differential between

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.373
men and women.
If Milton had imagined a cosmos

00:28:46.373 --> 00:28:49.873
that privileged physical
strength, then I think we would

00:28:49.873 --> 00:28:53.437
have no choice but glumly to
accept the fact that Adam is

00:28:53.437 --> 00:28:56.410
indeed superior to Eve.
You could imagine how an

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.138
argument like this could have
played out in the pages of

00:28:59.138 --> 00:29:01.801
Paradise Lost.
Milton could easily have

00:29:01.801 --> 00:29:05.382
argued that human excellence
could be determined by the sheer

00:29:05.382 --> 00:29:08.904
number of shrubs that Adam and
Eve were able to prune on any

00:29:08.904 --> 00:29:11.683
given day.
In such a world Adam would be

00:29:11.683 --> 00:29:15.449
able to prove his superiority,
but physical strength -- and

00:29:15.449 --> 00:29:18.501
this is important -- means
absolutely nothing in

00:29:18.501 --> 00:29:20.812
Paradise Lost.
In fact,

00:29:20.812 --> 00:29:25.003
if anything Milton is always
denigrating the importance of

00:29:25.003 --> 00:29:28.803
physical strength.Okay.
Given that, [laughs]

00:29:28.803 --> 00:29:33.107
we still have to ask the
question: why try to argue for

00:29:33.107 --> 00:29:37.809
the inequality of the sexes on
the basis of hair length?

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:40.713
I presume that none of you have
had children,

00:29:40.713 --> 00:29:44.740
but you probably still know
nonetheless that men and women,

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:48.981
or boys and girls,
are not born with distinct or

00:29:48.981 --> 00:29:53.737
distinguishable heads of hair.
At least until male pattern

00:29:53.737 --> 00:29:56.641
baldness sets in,
the hair of men and women

00:29:56.641 --> 00:29:59.269
aren't distinct or
distinguishable.

00:29:59.269 --> 00:30:03.031
If anything,
male pattern baldness simply

00:30:03.031 --> 00:30:07.176
gives women an edge.
If Milton wanted to use hair as

00:30:07.176 --> 00:30:10.658
a natural sign of sexual
difference, I would think he

00:30:10.658 --> 00:30:13.069
should be discussing facial
hair.

00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:17.112
Adam's superiority presumably
could be evinced by his

00:30:17.112 --> 00:30:20.346
commanding beard.
We could imagine Milton doing

00:30:20.346 --> 00:30:23.799
that, something that Eve lacks
by virtue of her anatomy,

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:27.341
but the hair on the head --
this doesn't make any sense --

00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:30.820
the hair on the head is in fact
one of the few anatomical

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.995
[laughs]
features that is absolutely

00:30:32.995 --> 00:30:37.672
gender neutral.
Our hair is gendered by virtue

00:30:37.672 --> 00:30:41.493
of the barber,
not by virtue of the

00:30:41.493 --> 00:30:48.349
Creator.This brings us to
this fact which we all know,

00:30:48.349 --> 00:30:51.374
and which is what every
obstetrician knows:

00:30:51.374 --> 00:30:55.261
the obvious distinguishing
anatomical characteristic is

00:30:55.261 --> 00:30:58.386
genitalia.
Milton actually does mention

00:30:58.386 --> 00:31:02.923
Adam and Eve's mysterious parts,
but he mentions them only to

00:31:02.923 --> 00:31:06.740
dismiss their difference.
He may be gesturing toward

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.730
something like -- you'll tell me
if this is crazy -- something

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:14.328
like a genital difference when
he describes Adam's hair:

00:31:14.328 --> 00:31:17.010
His locks "manly hung /
Clust'ring."

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:22.319
I don't think that holds.
The sexual signifier that

00:31:22.319 --> 00:31:28.031
"hangs manly" off of Adam's body
and that signifier which has

00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:31.652
traditionally,
of course, been invoked as a

00:31:31.652 --> 00:31:34.799
sign of sexual superiority is
Adam's penis;

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:38.274
but Milton alludes to this
genital signifier of difference,

00:31:38.274 --> 00:31:40.970
their mysterious parts,
only to dismiss it.

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:45.037
He chooses instead for the
distinguishing characteristic of

00:31:45.037 --> 00:31:48.964
the sexes a phenomenon that's
rooted not in nature but in

00:31:48.964 --> 00:31:51.839
culture: hair length.Like
Hobbes,

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:54.963
Milton is under a tremendous
cultural pressure when he

00:31:54.963 --> 00:31:57.380
describes the earliest state of
nature.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.220
The description of nature has
to bear the weight of all of the

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.059
social and all of the political
claims that the poem makes,

00:32:05.059 --> 00:32:08.303
and the set of social
conditions that Milton has to

00:32:08.303 --> 00:32:12.259
justify and make seem natural is
a particularly tricky one.

00:32:12.259 --> 00:32:15.956
Both Eve and Adam have to be
seen as absolutely free,

00:32:15.956 --> 00:32:20.292
each of them has to be capable
of exercising reason and making

00:32:20.292 --> 00:32:24.654
reasonable, rational decisions.
In this sense Adam and Eve

00:32:24.654 --> 00:32:28.619
enjoy something like the
absolutely egalitarian world,

00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:31.329
the structure of the political
world that we had seen in a

00:32:31.329 --> 00:32:34.323
treatise like Areopagitica,
Milton at his most

00:32:34.323 --> 00:32:37.652
exuberantly liberal.
But while Adam and Eve enjoy

00:32:37.652 --> 00:32:40.604
all of the rights of an
egalitarian society,

00:32:40.604 --> 00:32:43.351
as they do, I think,
in Paradise Lost,

00:32:43.351 --> 00:32:45.960
they are not therefore
equal.

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.725
Adam appears to be superior to
Eve, and Milton will only tell

00:32:50.725 --> 00:32:55.179
us that he appears such.
The narrator cannot make this

00:32:55.179 --> 00:32:59.876
claim in anything like a more
declarative sense.On the

00:32:59.876 --> 00:33:03.089
basis of at least their
appearances,

00:33:03.089 --> 00:33:07.652
the social formation in Eden is
strictly hierarchical,

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:12.904
and on some extraordinary level
this poem is trying to have it

00:33:12.904 --> 00:33:15.730
both ways.
So much of the energy of the

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:19.320
account of paradise derives from
Milton's contradictory account

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.519
of the political structure of
Eden.

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:24.779
He applies to the Edenic
society of Adam and Eve what I

00:33:24.779 --> 00:33:28.339
take to be two irreconcilable
modes of social governance.

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:31.968
Eden is once egalitarian,
its inhabitants are -- in

00:33:31.968 --> 00:33:35.960
"naked Majesty" they're "Lords
of all," both of them.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.367
Adam and Eve are entirely free
and self-determining,

00:33:39.367 --> 00:33:42.774
but at the same time Eden is
structured as a kind of

00:33:42.774 --> 00:33:46.849
aristocracy where the male class
is deemed categorically,

00:33:46.849 --> 00:33:50.480
genetically superior to the
female class.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.829
It goes without saying that
this situation is untenable.

00:33:53.829 --> 00:33:57.148
The contradictory social
formation of paradise is

00:33:57.148 --> 00:34:00.605
inherently unstable,
and I'm convinced that nothing

00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:04.477
is more important in our
understanding of the dynamics of

00:34:04.477 --> 00:34:08.348
the Fall than these principles:
the principle that Eve is

00:34:08.348 --> 00:34:11.460
absolutely free and equally
rational,

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.604
equally capable of rational and
virtuous choices,

00:34:14.604 --> 00:34:18.077
but also the conflicting
principle that Eve is to some

00:34:18.077 --> 00:34:21.680
extent subject to Adam's
authority.The contradictory

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:25.546
political impulses in the poem
are brilliantly worked out in

00:34:25.546 --> 00:34:28.560
the first description of Adam
and Eve.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.550
Look at line 307.
This is unbelievable.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.558
Look at what Milton is able to
establish by way of a

00:34:35.558 --> 00:34:39.705
description of Eve's hair.
It's here in a representation

00:34:39.705 --> 00:34:44.009
of her hair that the nature of
the Edenic polity is

00:34:44.009 --> 00:34:46.340
established.
Eve's golden tresses: 

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.646
[W]av'd
As the Vine curls her tendrils,

00:34:49.646 --> 00:34:53.500
which impli'd
Subjection, but requir'd with

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:56.612
gentle sway,
And by her yeilded,

00:34:56.612 --> 00:35:01.341
by him best receiv'd,
Yielded with coy submission,

00:35:01.341 --> 00:35:05.869
modest pride [and isn't this a
beautiful line?]

00:35:05.869 --> 00:35:09.949
And sweet reluctant amorous
delay.

00:35:09.949 --> 00:35:14.875
The conflicting politics of
Eden are best captured by means

00:35:14.875 --> 00:35:19.885
of the rhetorical strategy of
oxymoron, or the contradiction

00:35:19.885 --> 00:35:22.709
in terms.
Milton packs this description

00:35:22.709 --> 00:35:26.268
of the first couple's -- this is
essentially a kind of erotic

00:35:26.268 --> 00:35:28.699
play that's being described
before us,

00:35:28.699 --> 00:35:32.019
and it's packed with oxymoronic
descriptions.

00:35:32.019 --> 00:35:37.018
Milton's trying to communicate
the incredibly delicate

00:35:37.018 --> 00:35:41.639
political balance of this
hierarchical society.

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:44.940
" This society may be
hierarchical," Milton is telling

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.119
us, "but it's not
authoritarian."

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:51.664
Eve may be subject to Adam,
who holds authority over Eve,

00:35:51.664 --> 00:35:56.046
but because she's free,
her subjection is required with

00:35:56.046 --> 00:35:59.872
a "gentle sway."
No sooner has Adam exercised

00:35:59.872 --> 00:36:04.829
his authority by gently swaying
Eve than she willingly yields to

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:07.863
him,
exercising her free capacity

00:36:07.863 --> 00:36:12.919
for consent and her capacity to
choose to be swayed by her

00:36:12.919 --> 00:36:17.619
superior.Eve's hair seems to
imply subjection,

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:21.718
but Eve's hair also seems to
imply freedom and a kind of

00:36:21.718 --> 00:36:25.769
resistance to subjection.
Eve yields not with submission

00:36:25.769 --> 00:36:29.170
-- Milton would never permit
himself to say that.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.699
Eve yields with a "coy
submission."

00:36:32.699 --> 00:36:36.037
She holds something back even
as she grants it,

00:36:36.037 --> 00:36:40.390
and we have detailed before us
the endless give-and-take that

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.800
this delicate political
structure requires.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.082
For Milton, this give-and-take
is not only the basis of a

00:36:46.082 --> 00:36:49.442
society.
It's the basis as well for

00:36:49.442 --> 00:36:56.117
eros, or sexual pleasure.
With that extraordinary phrase,

00:36:56.117 --> 00:37:01.121
"sweet reluctant amorous
delay," Milton's able to pack

00:37:01.121 --> 00:37:06.692
into three adjectives and one
noun the pleasure derivable by

00:37:06.692 --> 00:37:12.074
both parties in Eve's exercise
of resistance.But Eve's

00:37:12.074 --> 00:37:16.039
coyness isn't just sexy for
Milton.

00:37:16.039 --> 00:37:19.362
It's also politically
meaningful, and from a political

00:37:19.362 --> 00:37:22.621
perspective her capacity for a
kind of reluctance and

00:37:22.621 --> 00:37:26.508
resistance serves as a guarantee
for her capacity for a kind of

00:37:26.508 --> 00:37:30.473
rational consent.
It's also theologically

00:37:30.473 --> 00:37:33.533
resonant.
From a theological perspective,

00:37:33.533 --> 00:37:36.763
Eve's willingness to resist,
to delay, constitutes a

00:37:36.763 --> 00:37:39.739
guarantee of her divinely
granted free will.

00:37:39.739 --> 00:37:43.300
Eve cannot be forced to do
anything.

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:48.348
It's as if in this little dance
that they perform in the

00:37:48.348 --> 00:37:53.423
quotidian life of unfallen Eden,
Eve is practicing in a small

00:37:53.423 --> 00:37:57.400
way for that crucial moment at
the temptation in which her

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.865
ability to resist and delay will
mean the difference between life

00:38:01.865 --> 00:38:05.484
and death.Now,
we as readers find it difficult

00:38:05.484 --> 00:38:08.798
I think -- we should,
at least, find it difficult --

00:38:08.798 --> 00:38:12.696
to found a theory of hierarchy
on something so fragile and so

00:38:12.696 --> 00:38:16.725
easily alterable -- you can tell
I just had a haircut yesterday

00:38:16.725 --> 00:38:20.794
-- as hair length;
but what's even more amazing

00:38:20.794 --> 00:38:26.206
than that is the fact that the
nature of the gendered hierarchy

00:38:26.206 --> 00:38:30.483
of Adam and Eve isn't even
evident to Adam and Eve

00:38:30.483 --> 00:38:33.610
themselves.
This blows me away.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.380
Look at Eve's first memory in
Paradise Lost.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:40.136
This is line 477,
page 289 in the Hughes.

00:38:40.136 --> 00:38:45.011
Eve is far from being able
to recognize Adam's superiority

00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:47.789
immediately.
For Eve there's certainly

00:38:47.789 --> 00:38:51.389
nothing in the length of his
hair that suggests that he might

00:38:51.389 --> 00:38:53.670
enjoy a kind of authority over
her,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.086
and in fact,
to Eve Adam seems to be a

00:38:56.086 --> 00:38:59.808
noticeably inferior creature
when she compares him to that

00:38:59.808 --> 00:39:02.908
image of herself,
that beautiful and responsive

00:39:02.908 --> 00:39:05.830
image of herself that she had
found in the pool.

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:09.050
This is line 477.
She tells Adam: 

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.572
Till I espi'd thee,
fair indeed and tall,

00:39:12.572 --> 00:39:16.480
[she grants him that he's tall]
Under a Platan,

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.623
yet methought less fair,
Less winning soft,

00:39:20.623 --> 00:39:25.014
less amiably mild,
Then that smooth wat'ry

00:39:25.014 --> 00:39:29.234
image…
It's like the dissimile of the

00:39:29.234 --> 00:39:32.567
fair fields of Enna.
Adam can only be understood by

00:39:32.567 --> 00:39:35.368
what it is he lacks,
and indeed it's a lack of

00:39:35.368 --> 00:39:38.792
anything like a natural or
self-evident sexual hierarchy

00:39:38.792 --> 00:39:42.402
that constitutes one of the
central problems in Paradise

00:39:42.402 --> 00:39:46.199
Lost.
Hierarchy is not a natural

00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:50.172
fact in paradise.
It's an arbitrarily imposed

00:39:50.172 --> 00:39:54.112
social institution.
It's been imposed by God but it

00:39:54.112 --> 00:39:58.590
hasn't been built into the
structure of the natural world.

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.810
It's to Milton's great credit,
and I really mean this -- I

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:04.070
mean this with the utmost
seriousness,

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:08.663
that he labors to expose the
artificial cultural origins of

00:40:08.663 --> 00:40:13.415
the sexual subjection that at
the same time he is championing

00:40:13.415 --> 00:40:17.121
and celebrating.
Eve has to be told that Adam is

00:40:17.121 --> 00:40:21.158
her superior and she has to
undergo an elaborate process and

00:40:21.158 --> 00:40:23.347
a complicated process of
cultural

00:40:23.347 --> 00:40:27.384
indoctrination.Nowhere in
the description of Eden are we

00:40:27.384 --> 00:40:31.147
reminded more forcefully of our
incapacity to understand

00:40:31.147 --> 00:40:35.116
unfallen nature than in Milton's
description of Eve's hair:

00:40:35.116 --> 00:40:39.290
"her unadorned golden tresses
wore / Disshevell'd,

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.888
but in wanton ringlets wav'd."
"Disshevell'd and wanton" -- of

00:40:43.888 --> 00:40:46.241
course, these seem like
extraordinarily prejudicial

00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:48.925
adjectives.
They cast a moral judgment --

00:40:48.925 --> 00:40:52.695
it has seemed to readers,
from the very beginning -- on

00:40:52.695 --> 00:40:56.404
her long before she has sinned.
But once again Milton is

00:40:56.404 --> 00:40:59.130
playing with etymology,
and I think this is Ricks'

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:02.133
point: "Dishevell'd" is being
used here in its original

00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:05.881
literal sense.
It literally means "hair let

00:41:05.881 --> 00:41:09.150
down" -- she's not wearing a
bun.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.334
The ringlets are "wanton" in
that they are simply

00:41:12.334 --> 00:41:15.148
unrestrained.
The fact that we are so eager

00:41:15.148 --> 00:41:19.037
as readers to supply a kind of
loose or sexual meaning to these

00:41:19.037 --> 00:41:22.155
words implicates us,
Milton perhaps seems to be

00:41:22.155 --> 00:41:25.827
saying, and it implicates,
of course, Satan as well in the

00:41:25.827 --> 00:41:29.370
fallen perspective on the
ultimately mysterious union of

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:32.480
Adam and Eve.
We are eyeing them askance and

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.690
leering at them just as Satan
is.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.211
It's Stanley Fish's argument,
and it's not unconvincing,

00:41:38.211 --> 00:41:41.156
that Milton's purpose in
employing these loaded

00:41:41.156 --> 00:41:44.677
adjectives is to force the
reader to acknowledge her own

00:41:44.677 --> 00:41:47.429
fallen-ness,
to remind us all of the

00:41:47.429 --> 00:41:51.045
inadequacy of our fallen
perspective on this unfallen

00:41:51.045 --> 00:41:55.496
nature.We're wrong to import
a kind of moral prejudice to the

00:41:55.496 --> 00:41:59.954
words "disheveled" and "wanton,"
but Milton will push it even

00:41:59.954 --> 00:42:03.073
further.
Eve's hair is also waving and

00:42:03.073 --> 00:42:07.928
insinuating and in its waving,
curly motions it resembles

00:42:07.928 --> 00:42:13.129
nothing so much as that other
much less noble creature in the

00:42:13.129 --> 00:42:16.545
garden,
and that's, of course,

00:42:16.545 --> 00:42:20.869
the serpent.
Look at line 345.

00:42:20.869 --> 00:42:25.210
This is where Milton describes
the elephant and the serpent.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.570
I don't have time to comment on
it.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:30.844
I just want to say what an
amazing adjective,

00:42:30.844 --> 00:42:34.469
the "unwieldy" elephant!
[T]h' unwieldy Elephant 

00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:36.990
To make them mirth us'd all his
might, and wreath'd

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.539
His Lithe Proboscis;
close the Serpent sly

00:42:41.539 --> 00:42:44.150
Insinuating,
wove with Gordian twine

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:47.870
His breaded train...
The breaded train of the

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:51.285
serpent's waving motion
resembles nothing so much as the

00:42:51.285 --> 00:42:54.902
waving braids of Eve's hair.
Eve seems to be associated well

00:42:54.902 --> 00:42:57.467
in advance of the actual
temptation with the sly

00:42:57.467 --> 00:43:01.010
insinuations of the serpent,
an association that of course

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.839
can only damage any sense that
we have of her unfallen reason

00:43:04.839 --> 00:43:08.787
and her genuine free will;
but Milton carefully includes

00:43:08.787 --> 00:43:12.403
in this description another
example of a waving and

00:43:12.403 --> 00:43:16.165
insinuating motion in Eden,
and that's the elephant's

00:43:16.165 --> 00:43:19.557
proboscis.
He's prefaced his connection

00:43:19.557 --> 00:43:24.750
between Eve and Satan here with
the inclusion of the elephant.

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:29.399
He wants us to know with this
image of the elephant's light

00:43:29.399 --> 00:43:34.048
proboscis that the motion of
waving and weaving and weaving

00:43:34.048 --> 00:43:38.616
and insinuating are still in
fact entirely innocent and it

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:43.185
will only be Satan's subsequent
actions that retroactively

00:43:43.185 --> 00:43:47.443
infect them for us.
The problem being exposed once

00:43:47.443 --> 00:43:50.096
again is the problem of
representation:

00:43:50.096 --> 00:43:53.725
how can you represent an
unfallen state from a fallen

00:43:53.725 --> 00:43:58.070
perspective?Okay.
Look at the handout;

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:02.687
if you don't have a handout try
to get one from the corners of

00:44:02.687 --> 00:44:07.368
the room.
This representation of Adam and

00:44:07.368 --> 00:44:11.966
Eve was made in 1638.
Rembrandt did this drawing

00:44:11.966 --> 00:44:15.267
shortly before Milton was
beginning to think of

00:44:15.267 --> 00:44:18.622
Paradise Lost.
In the Rembrandt representation

00:44:18.622 --> 00:44:21.519
we have -- I think this is a
devastating critique of the

00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:24.889
seventeenth-century desire to
represent an unfallen paradise,

00:44:24.889 --> 00:44:26.630
what we have Milton trying to
do.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.238
Like Milton,
Rembrandt exposes the

00:44:29.238 --> 00:44:31.768
impossibility,
I think, of such a

00:44:31.768 --> 00:44:35.317
representation.
If we read the Book of Genesis,

00:44:35.317 --> 00:44:38.289
we know that Eve was alone with
the serpent,

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:41.699
and so we're seeing Adam and
Eve in this picture presumably

00:44:41.699 --> 00:44:44.872
after Eve has eaten the fruit
but before Adam had eaten

00:44:44.872 --> 00:44:48.399
it.Now Adam may not have
eaten the fruit but he certainly

00:44:48.399 --> 00:44:51.682
-- I mean,
look at this -- he certainly

00:44:51.682 --> 00:44:55.924
looks as fallen as Eve.
They are equally physically

00:44:55.924 --> 00:44:59.649
ugly, it seems to me,
and that's indisputable:

00:44:59.649 --> 00:45:02.050
nasty, brutish,
and short.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.613
It's as if they crawled out of
the pages of the famous

00:45:04.613 --> 00:45:07.659
thirteenth chapter of the first
book of Hobbes' Leviathan.

00:45:07.659 --> 00:45:11.610
Look at Eve's face with its
broad, overhanging brow that

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.488
looks [laughs]
-- she suggests the unevolved

00:45:14.488 --> 00:45:18.438
state of an upper primate more
than she does of the glorious

00:45:18.438 --> 00:45:21.050
and beautiful first human
female.

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:24.346
Look at Adam.
The presumably unfallen Adam

00:45:24.346 --> 00:45:28.813
here is writhing in a twisted
and guilty posture that gives

00:45:28.813 --> 00:45:32.510
him no moral superiority over
Eve whatsoever.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.157
If anything,
here Adam's hair seems more

00:45:36.157 --> 00:45:39.804
wanton and more disheveled than
[laughs]

00:45:39.804 --> 00:45:43.414
Eve's.
Rembrandt's Eden must be very

00:45:43.414 --> 00:45:45.428
humid.
There's a kind of frizzy,

00:45:45.428 --> 00:45:48.766
split-end thing going on with
both of them and especially with

00:45:48.766 --> 00:45:50.652
Eve,
but at least it's falling

00:45:50.652 --> 00:45:53.657
rather neatly over her head,
which can't be said of

00:45:53.657 --> 00:45:57.143
Adam.Of course,
the primary clue that this

00:45:57.143 --> 00:46:01.636
representation of Eden is
imposing upon unfallen Adam a

00:46:01.636 --> 00:46:06.545
sense of fallen-ness comes from
Rembrandt's shading of their

00:46:06.545 --> 00:46:09.680
genitals.
Actually, in the original you

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.739
can make out their genitalia
quite distinctly,

00:46:12.739 --> 00:46:17.010
but they're nonetheless shaded.
This is important for Rembrandt.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:20.317
They are partially hidden by
the dark and guilty shadow

00:46:20.317 --> 00:46:24.284
produced by the serpent;
the serpent you may or may not

00:46:24.284 --> 00:46:28.717
have noticed is that scaly,
hideous creature climbing the

00:46:28.717 --> 00:46:31.743
tree on the right.
Milton had gone out of his way

00:46:31.743 --> 00:46:33.697
to insist that the genitals of
Adam and Eve,

00:46:33.697 --> 00:46:36.079
their "mysterious parts,"
were not concealed,

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:39.173
but then he goes on to censure
us, his fallen readers,

00:46:39.173 --> 00:46:42.734
for the sense of guilty shame
that we bring to any speculation

00:46:42.734 --> 00:46:45.988
about their mysterious parts;
but Rembrandt -- it's as if

00:46:45.988 --> 00:46:47.679
Rembrandt's a step ahead of
Milton.

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:51.009
He's telling us that there can
be no such thing as a just

00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:53.150
representation of unfallen
nudity.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:57.554
Our darkened minds will
continually shade that nudity

00:46:57.554 --> 00:47:02.805
with the inescapable shadows of
guilt and shame that we have no

00:47:02.805 --> 00:47:07.039
choice but to bring to questions
of sexuality.

00:47:07.039 --> 00:47:10.825
Rembrandt joins Milton in
representing a scene that seems

00:47:10.825 --> 00:47:14.746
to lie somewhere -- both the
Eden of Rembrandt and the Eden

00:47:14.746 --> 00:47:19.004
of Milton seem to lie somewhere
between a fallen and an unfallen

00:47:19.004 --> 00:47:23.128
state.I think a lot of the
energy of the Rembrandt drawing

00:47:23.128 --> 00:47:27.049
derives from his refusal to
depict the moral superiority of

00:47:27.049 --> 00:47:31.428
one sex over the other.
There's no clear demarcation

00:47:31.428 --> 00:47:35.880
here of a sexual hierarchy or a
natural sexual hierarchy.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:39.369
This Adam doesn't seem any
physically stronger than Eve.

00:47:39.369 --> 00:47:42.265
If he is to be seen as the
greater sex, perhaps it's just

00:47:42.265 --> 00:47:44.954
because he's placed himself
arbitrarily in a physical

00:47:44.954 --> 00:47:48.129
posture of superiority.
He's placed one foot slightly

00:47:48.129 --> 00:47:52.440
on an elevated plane.
He's trying to get a leg up.

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:57.505
He's compensating perhaps for
his lack of a self-evident

00:47:57.505 --> 00:48:00.569
authority over Eve.
Tradition, of course,

00:48:00.569 --> 00:48:03.203
has always insisted,
and this is the story that we

00:48:03.203 --> 00:48:05.677
inherit as children,
that Eve seduced Adam into

00:48:05.677 --> 00:48:10.042
eating the fruit.
Adam would never have fallen if

00:48:10.042 --> 00:48:16.100
Eve hadn't tricked him into
eating the apple or implored him

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:20.820
to join her in her sin;
but Rembrandt here is refusing

00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.125
to attribute all of the guilt to
Eve.Now, it's possible that

00:48:25.125 --> 00:48:29.021
Adam is here trying to protect
Eve from the fruit with the

00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:33.431
gesture of his hand,
but he also might be reaching

00:48:33.431 --> 00:48:36.039
for the fruit,
grabbing it.

00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:39.972
It's possible that he's seizing
the fruit just as Milton's Adam

00:48:39.972 --> 00:48:42.699
seizes Eve when he finds her by
the pool.

00:48:42.699 --> 00:48:46.341
What I'm saying here is that
the suggestion in both Milton

00:48:46.341 --> 00:48:49.855
and Rembrandt is that the Fall
has less to do with Eve's

00:48:49.855 --> 00:48:54.200
seduction of Adam than the more
foundational and the structural,

00:48:54.200 --> 00:49:00.696
problem of sexual inequality.
The Fall starts to look more

00:49:00.696 --> 00:49:05.957
and more like the inevitable
consequence of sexual

00:49:05.957 --> 00:49:11.119
hierarchy.Okay.
I'm going to conclude after we

00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:16.533
take one final look at the
Rembrandt, at the visual details

00:49:16.533 --> 00:49:22.040
that Rembrandt forces into a
kind of analogous relation.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:24.776
In this he's like Milton.
Like Milton,

00:49:24.776 --> 00:49:29.126
Rembrandt draws into an
analogous relation the slithery

00:49:29.126 --> 00:49:34.281
length of that awful serpent and
the innocent and playful winding

00:49:34.281 --> 00:49:38.980
of the elephant's proboscis.
You can see the unwieldy

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:44.590
elephant in the lower right-hand
corner of the Rembrandt drawing,

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:48.879
but the proboscis and the
serpent's tail are not the only

00:49:48.879 --> 00:49:51.559
snaky things in Rembrandt's
Eden.

00:49:51.559 --> 00:49:55.240
As I mentioned earlier,
in the original drawings Adam's

00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.239
mysterious part is actually
quite visible.

00:49:58.239 --> 00:50:01.505
It's nasty, it's brutish,
it's short, but it's

00:50:01.505 --> 00:50:05.570
discernible, and it's important
that it's discernible.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:08.942
Through this technique of
visual juxtaposition,

00:50:08.942 --> 00:50:13.267
Rembrandt casts an evil and
satanic shadow over this part of

00:50:13.267 --> 00:50:16.741
Adam's anatomy,
that distinguishing feature of

00:50:16.741 --> 00:50:20.974
his sex which is the arbitrary
signifier of his authority over

00:50:20.974 --> 00:50:24.838
Eve.
So Adam's authority here in its

00:50:24.838 --> 00:50:31.486
most intimate manifestation may
be as complicit as the serpent

00:50:31.486 --> 00:50:37.480
in the crime of the
Fall.Satan sees all of this.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.894
He sees this weird and
bizarrely unstable sexual

00:50:40.894 --> 00:50:44.600
hierarchy in Milton's Eden,
and what does he say?

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:56.360
Line 521 at page 290.
Milton has Satan announce that

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.469
he -- "Eureka!
I know how I'm going to do it!"

00:50:59.469 --> 00:51:02.989
-- he's arrived at his scheme
to destroy Adam and Eve.

00:51:02.989 --> 00:51:07.390
He says, just having witnessed
all of this, "O fair foundation

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.059
laid whereon to build / Thir
ruin!"

00:51:10.059 --> 00:51:12.250
"I know how I'm going to be
able to bring this place down!"

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:17.431
Now, Milton isn't eager to join
Satan in this claim of God's

00:51:17.431 --> 00:51:22.701
injustice, but he's willing to
expose the inherently unstable

00:51:22.701 --> 00:51:26.389
foundation of Eden's sexual
hierarchy.

00:51:26.389 --> 00:51:29.445
Milton lays the foundation
ultimately, I think -- as we'll

00:51:29.445 --> 00:51:33.006
see when we read Book Nine,
he lays the foundation for our

00:51:33.006 --> 00:51:36.283
understanding of some of the
deepest causes of the

00:51:36.283 --> 00:51:39.023
Fall.Okay.
Remember for next time a big

00:51:39.023 --> 00:51:40.912
chunk of reading:
Books Five, Six,

00:51:40.912 --> 00:51:42.045
Seven and Eight.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.260
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.750
so what did I tell you about
waves?

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.098
I said let's take a concrete
example instead of talking in

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:04.780
generalities.
You say wave is the disturbance

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.354
of some medium.
The medium I chose to study was

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:12.790
a string, under some tension,
clamped at both ends.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.775
Then, you pull it and you
release it, it's going to be

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.900
doing something.
This height,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.252
from the normal position,
at the point x,

00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:26.973
is the actual variable,
of ψ of x and

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:29.843
t.
So, at every point x

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:32.525
along the string,
there's a displacement of the

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.739
string in the transverse
direction;

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:36.300
that's ψ of x
and t.

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:45.235
I showed you that this
ψ obeys the following

00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:50.220
equation: d^(2)ψ over
dx^(2),

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.139
equals 1 over v^(2),
d^(2)ψ over

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:59.085
dt^(2),
where v^(2) is tension

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:03.817
divided by mass per unit length.
I'm going to change my notation

00:02:03.817 --> 00:02:07.980
into force, because T is
also used for time period;

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.173
so it's going to be,
it's going to get me in trouble

00:02:10.173 --> 00:02:12.017
very soon.
So, let's just change the

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:15.204
formula to what's used in the
books, v^(2) is F

00:02:15.204 --> 00:02:17.478
over μ;
F is the tension on the

00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:21.810
string.
So, what--how did we get this?

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.280
Let me remind you how I got
this, okay?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.289
Let's undo the v^(2) as
T over μ.

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:33.020
What we are saying is
Td^(2)ψ over

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.569
dx^(2),
is equal to μ;

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.139
d^(2)ψ over
dt^(2).

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:44.946
This is very easy to
understand, the meaning of the

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:48.220
equation, I claim,
is just F = ma.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.122
You realize that this is the
a of the string,

00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:53.626
moving up and down,
this is the acceleration,

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:55.960
and this is the mass per unit
length.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.919
So, imagine a tiny segment of
width dx.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.792
If you multiply both sides by
dx, that is the mass of a

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:07.110
little segment.
μ times dx is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.340
the mass;
this is mass times acceleration.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.470
The left-hand side is the force
on it.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.194
Why is this the force?
I tried to explain to you,

00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:19.654
that if you took a piece of
that string, then the tension is

00:03:19.654 --> 00:03:22.352
pulling like that there
[pointing to the board]

00:03:22.352 --> 00:03:25.008
and like this here,
and the two don't cancel

00:03:25.008 --> 00:03:27.609
because if you resolve this
force into vertical and

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.732
horizontal parts,
that into the vertical and

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.188
horizontal part [pointing to the
board], you can see this is

00:03:32.188 --> 00:03:35.781
going to be bigger than that.
So, the slope itself is

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:41.090
changing and this is the rate of
change of the slope.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.721
Another way to think about it
is if you remember your

00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:46.807
calculus, the second derivative
of a function is the curvature

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:49.564
of the function;
so that if you draw a graph

00:03:49.564 --> 00:03:52.794
like this, that's a function of
negative curvature,

00:03:52.794 --> 00:03:55.960
that's a function which is
positive curvature.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.840
It says, if the string has
negative curvature,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.513
the force is down;
if the string has positive

00:04:01.513 --> 00:04:04.406
curvature that probably means
you are below your normal

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:06.535
position;
then it's getting a force

00:04:06.535 --> 00:04:09.123
upwards.
So, it's the curvature of the

00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:11.530
string that leads to a net
force.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.698
One of you asked me a very good
question after class which

00:04:15.698 --> 00:04:19.814
is--the question was,
"You took care of the vertical

00:04:19.814 --> 00:04:22.978
forces as T sin (θ +
Δθ) here,

00:04:22.978 --> 00:04:26.054
and T sin θ here,
and you did all the

00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:28.360
cancellations.
How about the horizontal part?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.360
That's also not quite balanced,
the angles are not equal."

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.846
But the point was sin θ
was approximated by θ

00:04:35.846 --> 00:04:38.758
for small angles,
but cos θ,

00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:42.303
you guys remember,
begins as 1 minus θ^(2)

00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:45.255
over 2 and so on;
but we are not keeping track of

00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:48.459
things more than the first power
of θ in the calculation.

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:51.574
So, cos θ is just 1,
in this approximation,

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:55.250
and tan θ and sin
θ are both equal to θ.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.290
That's a small angle
approximation.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.980
That's why the horizontal
forces, the fact that they don't

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.670
quite match is an error to the
next order in θ,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.759
but the vertical forces are
proportional to the first power

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.889
of θ,
and that's what we kept.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.800
That's the origin of the wave
equation.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.754
Then, you know you did the
cancellation of dx and so

00:05:14.754 --> 00:05:17.829
on and you went back to that
form.

00:05:17.829 --> 00:05:20.920
Then, I said how about
solutions to this equation?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.360
Well, if you have a little more
time I can tell you how to get

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.449
the solution to this equation.
I don't have that much time.

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.557
So, what we will do--going to
do, is to be content with

00:05:32.557 --> 00:05:35.435
writing down a solution,
then convincing you it's a

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:37.680
solution, analyzing its
properties.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.838
So, the solution I wrote down
looked like A cos (kx -

00:05:44.838 --> 00:05:47.062
ωt).
And I said, "Well,

00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:48.560
is that a solution of this
form?"

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.483
Well, take it,
put it into the equation and

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:54.108
take all the derivatives.
First of all you guys should be

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:58.500
able to see that the A
will cancel on both sides.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.113
Do you see that?
So, if you put this here,

00:06:01.113 --> 00:06:03.565
two derivatives will pull out a
k^(2),

00:06:03.565 --> 00:06:06.629
two derivatives here will pull
out an ω^(2).

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.904
Therefore, if you want the two
sides to match,

00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:14.415
you will want the ω^(2)
side divided by v^(2) to

00:06:14.415 --> 00:06:20.093
equal the k^(2).
That means ω = k

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:22.010
times v.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.726
That's the only condition.
If that is satisfied,

00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:29.331
if this ω is k
times v,

00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:30.170
you have a solution.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:39.600
No, and A stands for
anything;

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.069
you can have any amplitude you
want.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.459
Of course that's a little bit
of a fake.

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.440
Why is that not really
literally true?

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.766
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:52.843
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:06:52.843 --> 00:06:55.960
I tell you it's real and
positive, and two miles long.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.077
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:06:58.077 --> 00:07:00.509
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Not only that.

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:04.115
The whole calculation assumed
it was a small displacement

00:07:04.115 --> 00:07:06.490
problem, right?
That's why sin θ and

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.235
tan θ are all equal to
θ and cos θ is

00:07:09.235 --> 00:07:11.207
roughly 1.
So, once you make an

00:07:11.207 --> 00:07:15.202
approximation and you get an
answer, you should not blindly

00:07:15.202 --> 00:07:18.302
apply the answer to
circumstances that are not

00:07:18.302 --> 00:07:20.677
valid.
So, even though the answer says

00:07:20.677 --> 00:07:23.704
you can have any A that you
like, in practice you shouldn't

00:07:23.704 --> 00:07:26.227
use it for A,
which is so large that the

00:07:26.227 --> 00:07:31.540
small angle approximation fails.
Alright, so A is anything.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.922
So, let's put in the result
I've learned,

00:07:35.922 --> 00:07:42.277
namely, that ω = kv,
and write it as k times

00:07:42.277 --> 00:07:46.154
x - vt.
And here's where we were at the

00:07:46.154 --> 00:07:49.636
end of the class.
What this tells you is that

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:53.509
this guy is some function of
x - vt.

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:57.029
It happens to be A cos,
but it turns out any function

00:07:57.029 --> 00:08:00.370
of x - vt actually
satisfies the wave equation.

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:03.779
That's a very interesting
exercise for you calculus buffs.

00:08:03.779 --> 00:08:06.851
Take f unknown function,
whatever you like,

00:08:06.851 --> 00:08:10.298
but it's not an arbitrary
function in which x and

00:08:10.298 --> 00:08:12.680
t appear any way they
like,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.759
they appear only in this
combination.

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:17.560
So, make up any function you'd
like, hyperbolic cos of

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.893
x - vt,
that's a solution to the wave

00:08:19.893 --> 00:08:22.790
equation.
Why?

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.604
Because if you start taking
derivatives, if you call this

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:27.987
variable w,
you'll find that partial

00:08:27.987 --> 00:08:30.743
derivative of x and
partial derivative of,

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:34.073
with respect to T are
all connected with derivatives

00:08:34.073 --> 00:08:36.672
of w;
and then if you do the chain

00:08:36.672 --> 00:08:39.570
rule, you'll find it satisfies
the wave equation.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:42.570
Then, I tried to convince you
that because of that,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.450
v is actually the
velocity of the wave.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.295
Let me tell you why.
Take any function you like,

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:52.396
at a given time,
t = 0,

00:08:52.396 --> 00:08:56.046
it has a certain shape.
Our cosine has a certain shape,

00:08:56.046 --> 00:08:58.610
but take any shape you like,
a t = 0.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.353
Let us say it has peaked here.
If you wait a little bit,

00:09:02.353 --> 00:09:05.635
if you'd like it to be peaked
at x = 6,

00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:08.267
for example,
if you wait a little bit,

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:11.590
this term minus vt,
is subtracting it from it,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.804
you got to add to this the same
amount so that the peak now will

00:09:15.804 --> 00:09:18.206
be there.
The amount by which it has

00:09:18.206 --> 00:09:21.090
moved is in fact exactly equal
to vt.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.195
In other words,
if the vt becomes non

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.938
zero, x should become non
zero by the same amount,

00:09:25.938 --> 00:09:28.240
if you want to ride the crest
of that wave.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.429
That means the signal is moving
to the right.

00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:34.579
So, it turns out you can have
x - vt or x + vt,

00:09:34.579 --> 00:09:37.759
they're both solutions to the
wave equation.

00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:40.269
With a minus sign the signal is
moving to the right;

00:09:40.269 --> 00:09:42.460
with a plus sign it's moving to
the left.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.980
That's a summary of what I did
last time.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:49.769
So, last time we derived the
wave equation;

00:09:49.769 --> 00:09:53.600
we took this particular
solution.

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:59.788
Alright.
The next thing I want to do is

00:09:59.788 --> 00:10:04.117
ask the following question,
"What is k and what is

00:10:04.117 --> 00:10:09.075
ω?"
So, let's take this function's

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:16.568
ψ, of x and
t, which is A cos kx -

00:10:16.568 --> 00:10:19.068
ωt.
See, a function of two

00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:20.980
variables is hard for us to
visualize.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.621
We are all good at explaining,
visualizing a function of one

00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:25.950
variable, but this is a function
of two variables.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.062
Understand why it's two.
Every point on the string has a

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:33.863
variable ψ at that
point, and that variable can

00:10:33.863 --> 00:10:36.299
vary with time.
That's why ψ of

00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:39.453
x and t is needed
to describe the vibration of an

00:10:39.453 --> 00:10:42.188
extended body like a string.
But a point particle,

00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:44.780
you just need one or two or
three coordinates.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.466
Alright.
Now, I look at this function

00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:50.853
and I say, "Let me at least
understand this function at

00:10:50.853 --> 00:10:56.990
t = 0."
A t = 0, drop that term;

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.754
in other words,
this is a snapshot of the

00:10:58.754 --> 00:11:00.789
function.
What does it look like?

00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:04.759
If I take a picture at t
= 0, then I vary space.

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:08.857
Well, that's cos kx,
and you can all plot cos

00:11:08.857 --> 00:11:12.198
kx, versus x.
It's going to start out at

00:11:12.198 --> 00:11:15.199
A, then it's going to
oscillate because that's what

00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:16.200
the cosine does.

00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:22.960
Now, this distance from one
peak to the next peak,

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.749
we call the wavelength.
It's also the distance from one

00:11:26.749 --> 00:11:31.220
trough to another trough or from
one point to an identical point.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.210
That distance where you repeat
yourself is called lambda (λ).

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.059
What is the relation of
k to λ?

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:42.100
Now, you got to ask yourself,
when x was 0,

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:45.155
this angle was 0.
I've got to increase x

00:11:45.155 --> 00:11:48.129
till it come back to what's
essentially is 0.

00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:51.182
For A cos,
you are back to essentially 0

00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:54.537
if this angle is 2π.
It can also be 4π or

00:11:54.537 --> 00:11:58.026
6π, but the first time
you are back to 0 is when it's

00:11:58.026 --> 00:12:00.789
2π.
Therefore the length λ,

00:12:00.789 --> 00:12:04.309
up there, has a property that
k times λ is

00:12:04.309 --> 00:12:06.467
2π,
because if I move to the right

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:08.595
by an amount λ,
the angle in the cosine are

00:12:08.595 --> 00:12:11.563
changed by 2π.
So, this number called k

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:15.307
is related to the number we all
understand more intuitively by

00:12:15.307 --> 00:12:17.896
this formula.
It's the inverse of the

00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:20.830
wavelength, up to this factor
2π.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.678
Now you can say,
well, you picked time t

00:12:24.678 --> 00:12:26.669
= 0;
maybe if you picked time

00:12:26.669 --> 00:12:30.580
t = 1 second you would
have gotten a different picture.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.871
Think about it.
If I put t = 1 second,

00:12:32.871 --> 00:12:35.723
as long as it's a fixed number,
that's some fixed angle

00:12:35.723 --> 00:12:37.544
φ;
it's just going to shift the

00:12:37.544 --> 00:12:40.391
whole pattern by some amount;
it won't change the fact that

00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:42.980
the peak to peak distance is
still λ.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.976
Because what's happening as a
function of time,

00:12:45.976 --> 00:12:50.016
we have seen very generally is
that this whole pattern is going

00:12:50.016 --> 00:12:53.600
to slide to the right.
So, I want to combine this

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:58.107
picture with a dynamic picture
by saying, if you now vary time,

00:12:58.107 --> 00:13:02.554
imagine this sliding by.
If you are sitting somewhere

00:13:02.554 --> 00:13:07.169
here, or some point,
that'll be the height for you,

00:13:07.169 --> 00:13:09.407
and as time goes by that'll be
the height and that'll be the

00:13:09.407 --> 00:13:11.720
height and that'll be the height
and that'll be the height;

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.230
all these things will go past
where you are.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.379
So, let us now ask,
"What does it look like to a

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:20.929
person sitting at a certain
location, as a function of

00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:22.364
time?"
In other words,

00:13:22.364 --> 00:13:24.759
the waves are being
manufactured in the ocean.

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:26.530
Let's say they're being sent
towards the shore.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.740
You stand in one place;
the wave's going to go past you.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.359
So, you will bob up and down,
and that's what I want to

00:13:32.359 --> 00:13:34.700
understand.
So, I pick some location.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:38.975
I pick x = 0 for
convenience, then ψ at

00:13:38.975 --> 00:13:42.202
x = 0,
as a function of time looks

00:13:42.202 --> 00:13:45.430
like A cos
ωt.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.247
I didn't miss the minus sign;
for a cosine,

00:13:48.247 --> 00:13:51.669
it doesn't matter if you change
the angle to minus the angle.

00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:57.131
So, plot the same graph now
this time as a function of time,

00:13:57.131 --> 00:14:02.118
and ask what happens.
Well, you start with a maximum

00:14:02.118 --> 00:14:06.676
and you bob up and down.
This is a picture at one point

00:14:06.676 --> 00:14:10.159
where the water or the string
goes up and down.

00:14:10.159 --> 00:14:14.482
So we like to call this,
from one maximum to the next

00:14:14.482 --> 00:14:18.554
maximum, the time period [T].
That's the time over which the

00:14:18.554 --> 00:14:21.174
wave repeats itself.
Well it follows then,

00:14:21.174 --> 00:14:24.924
that ω times the time
period is 2π,

00:14:24.924 --> 00:14:29.350
because when I put little
t equal to time period,

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.830
I've gone from this maximum to
that maximum.

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:40.129
Therefore, ω is
2π over T;

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:43.472
in other words k and
ω, which we put into the

00:14:43.472 --> 00:14:46.530
wave, are related to the time
period and the wavelength

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:48.570
through this reciprocal formula.

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:59.389
So, if you like you can write
the wave as A cos

00:14:59.389 --> 00:15:05.120
(2πx/λ -
2πt/T).

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.960
It's strictly equivalent,
you write it any way you like.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.863
This makes it clear that when
x changes by λ,

00:15:10.863 --> 00:15:13.864
nothing happens to the cosine
because when x changes by

00:15:13.864 --> 00:15:16.620
λ you are adding a
2π to the cosine.

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.919
Here, it's clear that if you
add to little t an amount

00:15:19.919 --> 00:15:21.955
of time big T,
nothing happens,

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:23.990
because 2πs don't
matter.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.519
So, this makes very clear the
periodicity in space and time;

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:29.792
but this is more compact
because if we don't want to

00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:32.109
carry 2π's and
λs in this complicated

00:15:32.109 --> 00:15:33.491
form,
we give a new name to

00:15:33.491 --> 00:15:36.110
2π over λ and
2π over T.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:42.143
Okay.
What about the velocity of the

00:15:42.143 --> 00:15:44.506
wave?
Remember, it satisfied this

00:15:44.506 --> 00:15:47.259
condition, so ω over
k.

00:15:47.259 --> 00:15:50.936
But now, let's write this in
terms of those new guys,

00:15:50.936 --> 00:15:54.470
2π over T
divided by 2π over

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.440
λ, is λ over
T.

00:16:04.669 --> 00:16:08.423
So, the velocity of this--This
wave is called a sine wave or A

00:16:08.423 --> 00:16:12.613
cosine wave or a plane wave.
You got to understand waves in

00:16:12.613 --> 00:16:16.519
water and waves in string always
have a velocity.

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:19.639
If you pluck the string and let
it go, a little blip will travel

00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:22.563
from left to right.
But not every wave has a

00:16:22.563 --> 00:16:26.288
wavelength or a time period.
This is a special function that

00:16:26.288 --> 00:16:28.250
has periodicity in x and
t.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.656
In other words,
if you go to a lake and drop a

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:33.972
rock, it'll send out some waves
and after awhile they'll spread

00:16:33.972 --> 00:16:35.946
out.
It's not going to happen over

00:16:35.946 --> 00:16:39.330
and over and over again.
But if you want a wave to be

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.894
present for all time,
for all space,

00:16:41.894 --> 00:16:44.970
you should keep on agitating
the water.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.781
That's what we imagine here is
the source of this wave is to

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:50.259
keep manufacturing these waves
from left to right.

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:54.287
So, you must remember that in
general every wave on a string

00:16:54.287 --> 00:16:57.905
or in a medium has a velocity
but not every wave has a

00:16:57.905 --> 00:17:01.550
wavelength or a time period.
Any pulse that travels from

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:04.037
left to right with speed
v is a possible

00:17:04.037 --> 00:17:07.382
displacement of the medium.
This is a particularly simple

00:17:07.382 --> 00:17:10.400
situation we study.
For that simple situation,

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.413
the velocity is connected to
wavelength and time period in

00:17:14.413 --> 00:17:17.539
this fashion,
or you may also like to write

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:20.089
it as λ times the
frequency.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.563
So, that's a very easy thing to
remember, because if you're

00:17:23.563 --> 00:17:26.814
trying to get a velocity,
it's going to be some distance

00:17:26.814 --> 00:17:29.321
over some time,
the only distance you can think

00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:31.609
of for a periodic wave is a
wavelength;

00:17:31.609 --> 00:17:33.589
the only time you can think of
is the time.

00:17:33.589 --> 00:17:36.640
It turns out that λ
over T is in fact simply

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.844
the velocity.
Here's another way to

00:17:38.844 --> 00:17:42.188
understand this.
Suppose I have a string that

00:17:42.188 --> 00:17:46.193
goes on to infinity,
and I'm catching it at this end

00:17:46.193 --> 00:17:49.019
and I start wiggling this
string.

00:17:49.019 --> 00:17:51.531
When I start wiggling this,
these pulses will travel--let

00:17:51.531 --> 00:17:53.280
us say they'll come up to this
point.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:59.460
Let's wait one more second.
In one more second I would have

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.573
manufactured a few more of these
pulses and the wave will look

00:18:03.573 --> 00:18:05.849
like that.
How many pulses would I make

00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:08.130
per second?
f;

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.714
how long is each one, λ?
So, that's how much the wave

00:18:12.714 --> 00:18:15.839
has advanced in one second;
that's why it's the velocity.

00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:20.100
You're making λ-sized
objects, f at a time,

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.390
f per second,
and pushing them out;

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.160
so the front of the wave
advances a distance λf

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.109
in one second,
that is the velocity,

00:18:28.109 --> 00:18:30.893
that's one way to understand
why λf is equal to

00:18:30.893 --> 00:18:31.460
v.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.462
Okay, so now,
I consider another aspect of

00:18:38.462 --> 00:18:42.040
these waves, and that's the
energy in the wave.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.357
First of all,
you've got to understand a

00:18:49.357 --> 00:18:52.339
vibrating string has some energy
compared to a string which is

00:18:52.339 --> 00:18:55.169
not vibrating.
Okay, you have an intuitive

00:18:55.169 --> 00:18:58.490
feeling the vibrations are a
cause of energy.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.753
I want to calculate now the
energy in a string vibrating

00:19:00.753 --> 00:19:03.100
according to this formula here
[pointing to the board].

00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:10.740
Now, if it's an infinitely long
string, the energy in it is

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.306
infinite, so you don't define
the energy of an infinitely long

00:19:14.306 --> 00:19:16.833
string,
you define the energy of a

00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:19.844
piece of a string;
in fact, you talk about energy

00:19:19.844 --> 00:19:23.182
per unit length.
So, if you take a string,

00:19:23.182 --> 00:19:28.877
it's been vibrating for a long
time, and the waves have been

00:19:28.877 --> 00:19:32.858
manufactured on the left,
they've gone out far to the

00:19:32.858 --> 00:19:36.510
right, we don't care how far.
Take a portion of the string,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:40.356
of length dx,
and ask, "How much energy does

00:19:40.356 --> 00:19:43.164
it have?"
We have already seen that if

00:19:43.164 --> 00:19:46.461
you sit at one point,
the string just moves up and

00:19:46.461 --> 00:19:49.337
down.
It executes simple harmonic

00:19:49.337 --> 00:19:51.682
motion.
When the string has gone out

00:19:51.682 --> 00:19:54.396
all the way fully,
it's like a spring which has

00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:57.349
been extended maximally.
That's when the string stops,

00:19:57.349 --> 00:20:00.273
turns around and comes back;
when the string has come to the

00:20:00.273 --> 00:20:02.744
horizontal position,
that's the normal equilibrium

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:04.559
position for a mass and a
spring,

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:07.395
that's when it's moving the
fastest, and overshoots and goes

00:20:07.395 --> 00:20:09.509
to the other side and goes back
and forth.

00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:12.609
So, every part of a string is
just undergoing simple harmonic

00:20:12.609 --> 00:20:14.779
motion--that's pretty obvious
from this.

00:20:14.779 --> 00:20:18.490
So, we just need to write down
the energy.

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:22.846
So, how do you write the energy?
The energy is going to be

00:20:22.846 --> 00:20:28.599
either kinetic or potential,
or the sum of the two.

00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:31.540
Now, you can find the energy
whenever you like because it's a

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.319
constant.
Let's find it when the velocity

00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:37.569
is a maximum,
like for harmonic oscillators,

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:39.928
it's like finding the velocity
on a mass that's just swinging

00:20:39.928 --> 00:20:42.339
past the normal position,
x = 0.

00:20:42.339 --> 00:20:45.678
There the entire energy is
kinetic energy,

00:20:45.678 --> 00:20:50.400
it's ½, μdx is the
mass of the segment I'm looking

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.579
at.
What's the maximum velocity?

00:20:53.579 --> 00:20:58.420
You guys remember from harmonic
oscillators, what's the maximum

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.465
velocity that a harmonic
oscillator has,

00:21:01.465 --> 00:21:06.660
whose motion is given by this?
Yep?

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.618
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:21:09.618 --> 00:21:11.490
Shankar: Yes,
ωA.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:13.420
This is--You're getting a Yale
education.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.351
So, that's the difference
between 40,000 dollars and

00:21:16.351 --> 00:21:18.823
10,000 dollars is that this is
not w,

00:21:18.823 --> 00:21:21.490
but ω [laughter].
Okay?

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:26.220
By the way, I could not get any
of my kids to say ω;

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.791
they keep saying w.
I'm trying to have more success

00:21:29.791 --> 00:21:32.930
with this class than with my own
offspring.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.492
But if you go to the outside
world, if you talk to any

00:21:35.492 --> 00:21:38.344
physicist, if you say w,
they'll think you're talking

00:21:38.344 --> 00:21:41.938
about the width of something.
So, you have to say ω,

00:21:41.938 --> 00:21:45.670
ok so the Greek alphabet is
essential to communication.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.541
So, this is Aω is the
maximum velocity and I've got to

00:21:48.541 --> 00:21:49.200
square that.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:57.380
Now, this is the energy of a
segment of a length dx.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.113
So, what we normally define is
a quantity called little

00:22:01.113 --> 00:22:04.640
u, and that is the energy
per unit length.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.788
That means just divide by
dx, and you get ½

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:14.010
μ, A^(2),
ω^(2).

00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:25.160
It is just the kinetic energy
of a segment of unit length.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.887
It's the total energy,
but I chose to compute it when

00:22:28.887 --> 00:22:33.710
it's all kinetic.
Yes?

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:35.362
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:22:35.362 --> 00:22:37.150
Shankar: µ is the
mass per unit length.

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.355
You understand?
You take the string,

00:22:39.355 --> 00:22:41.920
you find its mass and you
divide by length.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.900
There's so much mass per
centimeter or per meter,

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.547
that's μ.
That's why if you go back to

00:22:47.547 --> 00:22:50.377
the derivation of the wave
equation we were thinking in

00:22:50.377 --> 00:22:56.279
terms of μ.
Okay.

00:22:56.279 --> 00:23:00.468
Now, we can ask another
question, "What is the power

00:23:00.468 --> 00:23:05.150
sent into this wave by the
person exciting the medium?"

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:09.809
See, the string is tied to a
point at infinity.

00:23:09.809 --> 00:23:12.830
But let's say it started
oscillating a while ago,

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:16.480
and this is the part of the
string that has started moving,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.859
and I'm still shaking it here.
Let me wait one second.

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:24.835
If I wait one second,
this part of the string is now

00:23:24.835 --> 00:23:29.980
activated, and what's the energy
contained in the extra segment?

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:35.296
It's the energy per unit
length, ½ μa^(2)ω^(2),

00:23:35.296 --> 00:23:40.232
times the velocity.
That is the power I have to

00:23:40.232 --> 00:23:44.920
give in to produce this wave
continuously.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.341
Do you guys follow that?
If I wait one second,

00:23:48.341 --> 00:23:51.489
a segment of length v,
has now started moving,

00:23:51.489 --> 00:23:54.196
in the front end,
because the wave is being

00:23:54.196 --> 00:23:56.890
produced by me and sent out into
the medium.

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.748
The distance it travels in one
second is v,

00:23:59.748 --> 00:24:02.431
and all of that extra segment
is now vibrating,

00:24:02.431 --> 00:24:04.589
with this energy per unit
length.

00:24:04.589 --> 00:24:07.037
So, this is the extra energy
per second I have to give,

00:24:07.037 --> 00:24:09.928
and that's the power.
That power is provided by the

00:24:09.928 --> 00:24:13.851
person shaking the string.
A special property of life in

00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:18.710
one dimension is that this wave
goes undiminished in amplitude.

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:21.185
You can go 10 miles,
100 miles from me,

00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:25.029
the amplitude is still the
A that I produced here.

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:28.900
That's because all the energy
goes along this line.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.733
It's sort of atypical.
What typically happens is when

00:24:32.733 --> 00:24:36.064
you live in, when you take into
account vibrations such as

00:24:36.064 --> 00:24:38.381
sound,
in two or three dimensions,

00:24:38.381 --> 00:24:42.029
if you have a tower on top of
which you put a speaker,

00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:45.326
just making noise,
the energy radiates out in

00:24:45.326 --> 00:24:49.616
concentric circles.
And the power at the source is

00:24:49.616 --> 00:24:53.509
now spread over bigger and
bigger spheres.

00:24:53.509 --> 00:24:59.236
So, in three dimensions we have
the notion of intensity,

00:24:59.236 --> 00:25:02.880
which is the power per unit
area.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.357
What I'm saying is,
if you've got a speaker there

00:25:05.357 --> 00:25:08.911
that's sending out sound waves,
I take a one meter by one meter

00:25:08.911 --> 00:25:12.615
window and hold in front of me
and I ask how much power crossed

00:25:12.615 --> 00:25:16.720
this in one second?,
That's intensity.

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.055
You don't have the notion in
one dimension because you cannot

00:25:19.055 --> 00:25:21.429
hold a window in one dimension.
Three dimensions,

00:25:21.429 --> 00:25:24.120
you take a little square,
one by one meter,

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.579
and you define intensity to be
power per unit area.

00:25:27.579 --> 00:25:29.769
Of course, it doesn't have to
be one meter big.

00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:32.719
You can take a tiny square,
provided you divide by the area

00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:34.500
of the tiny square,
that is this.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.543
So, what do you think will
happen if there's a speaker

00:25:37.543 --> 00:25:40.816
mounted on top of a platform
that's radiating power at the

00:25:40.816 --> 00:25:43.750
rate P?
The intensity you get where you

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.245
are, I hope you understand,
will be simply [P over]

00:25:47.245 --> 00:25:50.245
4πr^(2),
where r is the radius of

00:25:50.245 --> 00:25:53.559
this sphere and you are a
distance out from the center;

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:57.216
and the power is going out
uniformly in all directions,

00:25:57.216 --> 00:26:00.670
and your share for the whole
sphere was P;

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:04.232
the share for the unit area on
the sphere is P divided

00:26:04.232 --> 00:26:09.668
by 4πr^(2).
And that's measured in watts

00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:17.089
per meter squared.
Yes?

00:26:17.089 --> 00:26:22.761
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:26:22.761 --> 00:26:27.191
Shankar: This one?
What else do you think it

00:26:27.191 --> 00:26:31.390
should have?
T for time period, why?

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:35.231
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:26:35.231 --> 00:26:38.210
Shankar: It's energy per
length.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.815
But if I wait one second,
the wave has gone a distance

00:26:41.815 --> 00:26:46.401
v times one second.
And so, the extra energy I've

00:26:46.401 --> 00:26:51.579
given every second has to pay
for v more meters.

00:26:51.579 --> 00:26:53.673
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:26:53.673 --> 00:26:55.639
Shankar Yes,
this is the energy per second,

00:26:55.639 --> 00:26:57.220
that's the power,
that's correct.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.976
So, if you check your units you
will find it's got energy per

00:27:01.976 --> 00:27:06.157
second.
Okay, so this is called the

00:27:06.157 --> 00:27:09.130
intensity.
And for sound we have another

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.970
way to measure intensity.
We define something called beta

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:17.694
(β), which is 10 times
the logarithm of the intensity

00:27:17.694 --> 00:27:23.741
divided by a standard intensity.
The standard intensity has a

00:27:23.741 --> 00:27:29.619
value, 10 to the minus 12 watts
per meter square.

00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:35.450
And this is called the number
of decibels.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:39.930
So, you measure the loudness of
a sound in decibels.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:42.849
You must have heard that
everywhere.

00:27:42.849 --> 00:27:45.950
You look at your amplifier will
have so many dBs in it.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:50.401
So, what's the dB talking about?
The dB says your speaker is

00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:54.259
making some--sending out some
energy;

00:27:54.259 --> 00:27:57.397
stay wherever you want,
at a certain distance from the

00:27:57.397 --> 00:28:00.950
speaker, see how much power is
passing past the unit area,

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.660
that's the numerator,
divided by the standard number.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.819
People all agreed on dividing
by the standard;

00:28:06.819 --> 00:28:10.342
then, take the logarithm of
that to the base 10 and multiply

00:28:10.342 --> 00:28:13.359
by 10.
That's called the number of

00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:15.848
decibels.
So, for example,

00:28:15.848 --> 00:28:21.751
if the power coming to me was
say 10 to the minus 11 watts per

00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:24.621
meter square,
then I over

00:28:24.621 --> 00:28:29.025
I_0 will be 10
to minus 11, divided by 10 to

00:28:29.025 --> 00:28:33.730
the minus 12,
which will be 10 to the 1;

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:39.737
and the log of 10 to the 1 is
just 1, and β will be 10

00:28:39.737 --> 00:28:43.106
dB.
So, a 10 decibel sound is a

00:28:43.106 --> 00:28:47.900
factor of 10 bigger than the
standard sound.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.450
But here's the interesting
thing.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:56.238
Suppose the intensity is 10 to
the minus 8 watts per meter

00:28:56.238 --> 00:29:00.778
square.
That is a thousand times more

00:29:00.778 --> 00:29:05.500
intense than this one.
But let's look at β.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.140
β becomes 10 log of 10
to the 4 now;

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:13.743
because 10 to the minus 8
divided by 10 to the minus 12 is

00:29:13.743 --> 00:29:16.373
40.
So, when intensity goes from

00:29:16.373 --> 00:29:20.340
some number to something a
thousand times bigger,

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:25.628
the decibel goes from 10 to 40.
The decibel grows much more

00:29:25.628 --> 00:29:28.750
slowly than the actual
intensity;

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.315
in fact, the decibel is keeping
track of how many zeros there

00:29:32.315 --> 00:29:34.990
are in the power,
it grows logarithmically.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.159
So, every time I add an extra 0
to the power,

00:29:38.159 --> 00:29:42.481
you go from 10 to 100,100 to a
1000, the decibel goes up just

00:29:42.481 --> 00:29:46.869
by, from 10 to 20 to 30 to 40.
That's why 80 decibels can be

00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:48.809
incredibly loud,
80,90, 100;

00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:51.220
100's a very painful number of
decibels.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.272
And I believe people use
decibels because the human ear

00:29:55.272 --> 00:29:59.549
is able to take a whole range of
intensity and hear it.

00:29:59.549 --> 00:30:02.420
The ability of the ear to
listen to intensity -- you might

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.543
think there's a very narrow band
you can hear -- you can hear a

00:30:05.543 --> 00:30:08.588
very wide band,
where the intensity ranges over

00:30:08.588 --> 00:30:10.691
several powers of 10.
In that case,

00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:13.605
instead of dealing with numbers
that go all the way from 10 to

00:30:13.605 --> 00:30:15.660
the minus 5 to 10 to the plus
something,

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:19.156
if you deal with the logarithm
of the number then it's more

00:30:19.156 --> 00:30:21.666
manageable.
So, you can imagine trivial

00:30:21.666 --> 00:30:25.182
problems involving finding
β, or given β

00:30:25.182 --> 00:30:31.672
finding the intensity and so on.
Okay, so now I'm finished with

00:30:31.672 --> 00:30:37.198
basic properties of waves.
Decibels is a property just for

00:30:37.198 --> 00:30:39.279
sound, you don't apply that to
light.

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:41.023
And the whole standard
intensity

00:30:41.023 --> 00:30:44.680
I_0--intensity
is well defined for everything;

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.819
even electromagnetic waves have
intensity;

00:30:46.819 --> 00:30:49.170
it's the power coming per unit
area.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:53.072
But when applied to sound,
if you take the log and

00:30:53.072 --> 00:30:56.655
multiply it by 10,
that's the decibel level of

00:30:56.655 --> 00:31:00.053
that sound.
Okay, now for another totally

00:31:00.053 --> 00:31:04.384
different property of wave
propagation, which I'm going to

00:31:04.384 --> 00:31:08.640
again apply to sound,
is the familiar Doppler effect.

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.947
So, the Doppler effect is the
well known phenomenon that if

00:31:15.947 --> 00:31:17.980
you have a source of definite
frequency,

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:22.126
like a siren in a fire truck,
when the fire truck is coming

00:31:22.126 --> 00:31:25.200
towards you, you hear a higher
frequency,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.802
and when it's gone past you,
you hear a lower frequency,

00:31:27.802 --> 00:31:31.119
and we just want to know why,
and by how much.

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:35.684
So, to proceed with this,
I want to remind you this

00:31:35.684 --> 00:31:41.015
relation, λ times f is v.
So we're going to bear that in

00:31:41.015 --> 00:31:44.319
mind.
So let's take a source that is

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:47.986
sitting still,
and you are standing here,

00:31:47.986 --> 00:31:53.744
listening to the sound.
The waves go by you and you see

00:31:53.744 --> 00:31:58.117
a certain wavelength.
That's the distance from one

00:31:58.117 --> 00:32:01.970
crest to the next.
Now suppose the source is

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.887
moving to the right,
at a certain speed,

00:32:05.887 --> 00:32:07.890
u;
u is the speed of the source.

00:32:12.829 --> 00:32:15.240
So what does the pattern look
like?

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.783
It's not too hard to visualize
that having emitted one crest,

00:32:19.783 --> 00:32:24.099
it's moved to the right before
it emits a second crest.

00:32:24.099 --> 00:32:27.413
So the pattern will get
crunched in a forward direction

00:32:27.413 --> 00:32:28.150
like this.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.972
So the waves will get squashed
because the spacing will have

00:32:38.972 --> 00:32:42.065
been λ, but now it's less than
λ because it's moved to the

00:32:42.065 --> 00:32:45.529
right to emit the second crest;
so spacing from crest to crest.

00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:50.657
The new λ, which I call λ
prime, will be λ minus the

00:32:50.657 --> 00:32:54.740
distance the source travels in
that time.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.690
In the time it takes to emit
one more pulse.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:05.431
That is the time period.
So let me write it as λ minus

00:33:05.431 --> 00:33:12.702
u over f, because T is 1 over f.
So, what is the new frequency

00:33:12.702 --> 00:33:15.110
that I will hear?
The new frequency I will hear

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:17.300
will be the velocity divided by
the new wavelength.

00:33:23.359 --> 00:33:25.982
By the way, you've got to
understand that even though the

00:33:25.982 --> 00:33:28.698
source is moving to the right,
the velocity of sound is not

00:33:28.698 --> 00:33:31.761
altered by that process.
A moving truck does not emit

00:33:31.761 --> 00:33:35.139
sound at an increased speed in
the forward direction or

00:33:35.139 --> 00:33:36.820
decrease.
The speed of sound is

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.859
controlled by the medium in
which it travels.

00:33:38.859 --> 00:33:41.539
If the medium is air it can
travel only at that speed.

00:33:41.539 --> 00:33:44.492
So you don't have a new
velocity when the thing begins

00:33:44.492 --> 00:33:46.866
to move.
The velocity is the same in

00:33:46.866 --> 00:33:49.490
air, as long as the air is not
moving.

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:54.580
So let's write it as v over λ
minus u over f;

00:33:54.580 --> 00:34:00.627
multiply top and bottom by f.
So we write it as f times

00:34:00.627 --> 00:34:05.129
something, which is v divided by
λ f, minus u,

00:34:05.129 --> 00:34:10.904
and we fiddle with that and
write it as v divided by v minus

00:34:10.904 --> 00:34:13.820
u,
because λ f is v;

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.366
and divide top and bottom by v.
This is something you'll find

00:34:17.366 --> 00:34:20.783
in every possible textbook.
So I don't want to take too

00:34:20.783 --> 00:34:24.507
long to go over the details.
The main trick is in writing

00:34:24.507 --> 00:34:27.367
this equation.
Once you've got this,

00:34:27.367 --> 00:34:32.167
the rest of it is just algebra.
The point is to realize that

00:34:32.167 --> 00:34:35.486
the waves get crunched,
because when you emit a crest

00:34:35.486 --> 00:34:39.232
and you rush towards that crest,
and emit a second crest,

00:34:39.232 --> 00:34:41.942
you've reduced the spacing by
your velocity,

00:34:41.942 --> 00:34:45.030
multiplied by the time between
such emissions,

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:47.760
which is the time of vibration
of the siren.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:53.221
So this is the formula.
The frequency is the normal

00:34:53.221 --> 00:34:55.920
frequency divided by 1 minus
something.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.140
So one minus something is less
than 1.

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:02.824
So the frequency will go up.
If you want to see what happens

00:35:02.824 --> 00:35:06.255
here, behind the thing,
you have the option of doing

00:35:06.255 --> 00:35:10.065
the same calculation behind,
and I think it's very obvious

00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:13.099
what you will find,
you will get 1 plus something.

00:35:13.099 --> 00:35:16.269
So we'll write both solutions
as minus or plus.

00:35:16.269 --> 00:35:18.638
In one case,
the frequency will be

00:35:18.638 --> 00:35:20.929
increased;
other case the frequency will

00:35:20.929 --> 00:35:23.413
be decreased.
So one way to think about it is

00:35:23.413 --> 00:35:26.710
if the source is coming towards
you, use the minus sign;

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:30.489
if the source is going away
from you, you use the plus sign.

00:35:30.489 --> 00:35:33.510
But you should know intuitively
at least what sign to pick.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.181
You've got to know if the
source is coming towards you the

00:35:36.181 --> 00:35:38.478
frequency will go up,
and if it's going away from,

00:35:38.478 --> 00:35:41.353
you it'll go down.
So, you pick the sign using

00:35:41.353 --> 00:35:44.316
that common sense.
Somebody had a question in the

00:35:44.316 --> 00:35:45.300
back.
Yes?

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.922
Student: With
relativistic speeds does that

00:35:47.922 --> 00:35:49.193
change for light?
Professor Ramamurti

00:35:49.193 --> 00:35:50.230
Shankar: Ah.
Relativistic speeds,

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:51.909
a lot of things happen,
that's correct.

00:35:51.909 --> 00:35:54.090
When you handle light you got
to be very careful.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.487
The velocity of light will be
the velocity of light,

00:35:56.487 --> 00:35:58.789
but the frequency will change
for many reasons.

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:01.596
First of all,
the ambulance clock and your

00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:05.155
clock no longer agree,
so there is something called a

00:36:05.155 --> 00:36:08.502
transverse Doppler shift,
where even if it's not coming

00:36:08.502 --> 00:36:11.510
towards you or going away from
you, or it is going in a circle,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.843
you're sitting in the middle.
It's going tangentially,

00:36:13.843 --> 00:36:16.180
so it's not coming towards you
or away from you,

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.119
you will still feel a Doppler
shift.

00:36:18.119 --> 00:36:20.645
That's because it's a moving
clock and therefore it'll slow

00:36:20.645 --> 00:36:22.177
down.
So, relativistic problems are

00:36:22.177 --> 00:36:23.719
more complicated.
Yes?

00:36:23.719 --> 00:36:26.300
Student: How does this
deal with sonic booms?

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.105
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:36:28.105 --> 00:36:30.045
sonic boom comes in,
in the following thing:

00:36:30.045 --> 00:36:32.663
f prime is f
divided by 1 minus u over

00:36:32.663 --> 00:36:34.809
v.
Let me embellish the formula by

00:36:34.809 --> 00:36:37.370
writing use of s,
where s means source.

00:36:42.389 --> 00:36:44.960
Okay, when the source is
moving, this is the formula.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.264
In relativity,
it was chock full of formulas

00:36:47.264 --> 00:36:50.373
like this, but we never worried
about what happens when the

00:36:50.373 --> 00:36:53.696
denominator vanishes because you
just cannot approach the speed

00:36:53.696 --> 00:36:55.622
of light.
You can approach it but you

00:36:55.622 --> 00:36:57.854
cannot reach it.
But the speed of sound is not

00:36:57.854 --> 00:37:00.586
an upper limit at all,
and you can have an ambulance,

00:37:00.586 --> 00:37:03.530
or a plane, that eventually
travels faster than this.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:06.007
So that's when,
imagine the waves getting

00:37:06.007 --> 00:37:09.600
crunched till all the crests are
piled right on top of each

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.760
other, and that's when there is
the sonic boom.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.967
And if you go faster than that,
the way the wavelets emerge

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:18.289
from you, so that you leave
behind a trail,

00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:20.280
there's nothing in front of
you.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:23.391
So, if a jet plane is coming
towards you, faster than the

00:37:23.391 --> 00:37:25.891
speed of sound,
you won't have time to get out

00:37:25.891 --> 00:37:29.670
of the way because it'll hit you
before the sound waves hit you.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.769
Okay, so sound is not the
absolute limit.

00:37:32.769 --> 00:37:35.973
So, there are possibilities of,
I mean, every time you go on

00:37:35.973 --> 00:37:38.803
the Concord, well,
not any more but when you did,

00:37:38.803 --> 00:37:42.289
you would be crossing this
thing pretty soon after takeoff,

00:37:42.289 --> 00:37:47.199
because you'd go several times
faster than the speed of sound.

00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:51.559
Okay, the last Doppler thing I
want to do is the opposite one

00:37:51.559 --> 00:37:55.047
where the siren is emitting nice
spherical waves,

00:37:55.047 --> 00:37:58.099
but you are rushing to meet the
siren.

00:37:58.099 --> 00:38:01.013
You are going with the speed
u, sub-observer

00:38:01.013 --> 00:38:06.000
[u_0].
Then, what happens?

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.305
So, let's see what to do.
What's the frequency at which

00:38:10.305 --> 00:38:13.327
you will see crests?
If you sat there and did

00:38:13.327 --> 00:38:16.280
nothing, you'll see them at the
normal frequency.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.375
But now you are,
these waves are spaced at

00:38:20.375 --> 00:38:24.969
distance λ apart,
but your velocity,

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:29.159
relative to sound is now
u_0 + v,

00:38:29.159 --> 00:38:32.195
your relative velocity.
Sound is moving to the right,

00:38:32.195 --> 00:38:34.522
you are moving to the left.
So, with respect to these

00:38:34.522 --> 00:38:37.409
crests you are zipping at a
speed u_0 + v.

00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:40.130
And the crests are spaced at a
distance λ apart;

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.030
there's nothing wrong with the
spacing between them;

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.020
they are just like shown here.
You are just rushing to meet

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.119
them now, from your side.
So, how many will you intercept

00:38:48.119 --> 00:38:50.869
in a second as this;
this is the relative speed and

00:38:50.869 --> 00:38:54.035
that's λ.
So let's write this,

00:38:54.035 --> 00:38:59.857
u_0 + v;
λ = v divided by

00:38:59.857 --> 00:39:02.404
f.
So, I'll bring the f

00:39:02.404 --> 00:39:05.278
upstairs.
And that you can write as

00:39:05.278 --> 00:39:09.353
f times 1 +
u_0 over

00:39:09.353 --> 00:39:10.490
v.

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.393
So, when you move towards the
source, the correction factor

00:39:19.393 --> 00:39:22.186
appears in the numerator;
when the source moves towards

00:39:22.186 --> 00:39:24.380
you, correction factor appears
in the denominator.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.891
You got to use common sense to
see if it's plus and minus and

00:39:27.891 --> 00:39:29.462
so on.
It's pretty obvious if you're

00:39:29.462 --> 00:39:30.869
rushing to meet the waves it's
plus;

00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:33.659
if you're running away from the
waves it's minus.

00:39:33.659 --> 00:39:36.907
Then, you can go on and on and
ask what happens if you are

00:39:36.907 --> 00:39:39.300
moving and the ambulance is also
moving;

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:41.139
then, you can combine the
formulas.

00:39:41.139 --> 00:39:44.583
But I don't want to do that,
that's not the whole course,

00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:48.903
dedicated to theory of sound,
but this is just to tell you

00:39:48.903 --> 00:39:53.731
how to reason in the two special
cases, source moving and

00:39:53.731 --> 00:39:56.754
observer moving.
Okay, so now,

00:39:56.754 --> 00:40:03.143
the rest of the class is going
to be focused on one essential

00:40:03.143 --> 00:40:06.831
property of waves.
So, the whole time I'm going to

00:40:06.831 --> 00:40:09.545
do just this one important
property of waves that has to do

00:40:09.545 --> 00:40:14.141
with interference of waves.
Look at the wave equation I

00:40:14.141 --> 00:40:17.100
wrote down.
It's a linear equation.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.734
You see that?
Don't be fooled by this

00:40:19.734 --> 00:40:22.159
d^(2)ψ.
That doesn't make it quadratic;

00:40:22.159 --> 00:40:24.110
it's the first power of
ψ on both sides.

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:27.019
Then, do the following exercise
in your mind.

00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:29.229
ψ_1 is a
solution, ψ_2

00:40:29.229 --> 00:40:31.760
is a solution.
Add the two equations.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.052
You can check that
ψ_1 +

00:40:33.052 --> 00:40:34.449
ψ_2 is also a
solution.

00:40:34.449 --> 00:40:38.045
So, these waves also have the
property that--what that really

00:40:38.045 --> 00:40:40.982
means is the following:
If you make some sound and

00:40:40.982 --> 00:40:44.179
you're sending some waves,
they make a certain pattern

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:47.855
that travels through space.
Then, I turn you off and I turn

00:40:47.855 --> 00:40:50.898
on another speaker here;
let's say the speaker makes a

00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:53.235
sound.
If you and the speaker are

00:40:53.235 --> 00:40:58.011
making sound at the same time,
then the air displacement where

00:40:58.011 --> 00:41:01.300
I am will be simply the sum of
the two.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.847
So, if one cause produces one
effect, a second cause produces

00:41:04.847 --> 00:41:07.389
a second effect,
then both are turned on;

00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:10.110
the wave they produced will
simply be the sum.

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:13.555
You can simply add them because
that respects the--satisfies the

00:41:13.555 --> 00:41:16.241
wave equation.
So, all I'm going to do from

00:41:16.241 --> 00:41:19.994
now until the end is take a
variety of situations where I'm

00:41:19.994 --> 00:41:24.937
going to be adding to waves.
So, the simplest problem is the

00:41:24.937 --> 00:41:27.949
following.
Pick a certain spot.

00:41:27.949 --> 00:41:31.699
You just sit there and listen
to two waves.

00:41:31.699 --> 00:41:34.860
So, you're not going to look at
the wave as a function of space.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.424
It's a function of time;
somebody is making the waves

00:41:37.424 --> 00:41:41.097
and sending them to you.
The first wave looks like

00:41:41.097 --> 00:41:45.360
ψ_1 = A cos
ω_1t.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:50.058
That's the second source of
sound, which is A cos

00:41:50.058 --> 00:41:53.886
ω_2t.
I've chosen the two to have the

00:41:53.886 --> 00:41:56.753
same amplitude,
but not necessarily the same

00:41:56.753 --> 00:41:59.030
frequency.
You want to add these two,

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:00.930
and you want to see what you
hear.

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:09.608
So, what you will hear will be
ψ_1 +

00:42:09.608 --> 00:42:13.264
ψ_2,
which will be A cos

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:17.989
ω_1t + cos
ω_2t.

00:42:17.989 --> 00:42:20.244
Now you can do the
trigonometric identities and

00:42:20.244 --> 00:42:23.136
figure out what has happened,
but you have to think a little

00:42:23.136 --> 00:42:24.950
bit about what's going to
happen.

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:29.438
Think about these two waves.
If they have the same

00:42:29.438 --> 00:42:32.300
frequency, it's trivial,
right?

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.122
If the ω_1
=ω_2,

00:42:35.122 --> 00:42:38.283
ψ = 2 A cos ωt;
where ω is the common

00:42:38.283 --> 00:42:40.421
frequency.
That just means they reinforce

00:42:40.421 --> 00:42:42.904
each other.
At every instant you get double

00:42:42.904 --> 00:42:46.791
what you got before.
But if the frequencies are not

00:42:46.791 --> 00:42:50.300
equal, then initially they are
in step.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.678
This cosine is 1,
and that cosine is 1 and the

00:42:52.678 --> 00:42:54.959
amplitude is 2A.
As time goes by

00:42:54.959 --> 00:42:58.411
ω_1t and
ω_2t start

00:42:58.411 --> 00:43:01.800
differing, so the cosines are
not in step anymore.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.598
And what can happen after
awhile is the two cosines are

00:43:05.598 --> 00:43:10.100
offset by half a cycle or the
angle between them is π.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:14.856
Then in fact, they will cancel.
Then, if you wait long enough,

00:43:14.856 --> 00:43:19.206
again, they will be in step.
One way to think about it is

00:43:19.206 --> 00:43:21.900
imagine two runners going around
in a track.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.352
If they have slightly different
speeds they start out together,

00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:27.579
they go around and one starts
lagging,

00:43:27.579 --> 00:43:29.542
behind the other,
and they will be on different

00:43:29.542 --> 00:43:31.462
parts of the circle,
and a time will come when

00:43:31.462 --> 00:43:33.340
they're on opposite parts of the
circle.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.453
When they're on opposite parts
of the circle,

00:43:35.453 --> 00:43:37.806
the angle or difference between
them is π,

00:43:37.806 --> 00:43:39.679
and that's when we say they
cancel.

00:43:39.679 --> 00:43:42.208
If you wait long enough they'll
again line up,

00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:45.073
but with one difference,
one guy would have done one

00:43:45.073 --> 00:43:48.983
more revolution than the other;
then again they will be in step

00:43:48.983 --> 00:43:51.410
and out of step.
That's what you expect the

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.173
formula to give you.
So, you got to go back and use

00:43:54.173 --> 00:43:57.239
the trigonometric formula.
And the answer is,

00:43:57.239 --> 00:44:00.118
2A cos
(ω_1 -

00:44:00.118 --> 00:44:04.130
ω_2,) over 2
times t,

00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:08.797
times cos (ω_1 +
ω_2), over 2

00:44:08.797 --> 00:44:12.822
times t.
This says cos A - cos B

00:44:12.822 --> 00:44:17.650
is 2 cos A - B over 2,
cos A - B over 2.

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:21.572
Alright, so we are interested
in the case where

00:44:21.572 --> 00:44:25.324
ω_1 is very
nearly equal to

00:44:25.324 --> 00:44:30.440
ω_2 so two
frequencies are very close.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.412
A typical situation--You have a
piano tuner, the piano tuner

00:44:33.412 --> 00:44:35.780
hits the fork,
it vibrates at some frequency,

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:40.691
maybe 440 Hertz,
and then your piano is slightly

00:44:40.691 --> 00:44:44.664
off, maybe it's 439.
What sound do you hear when you

00:44:44.664 --> 00:44:47.619
put them together?
Well, let's look at this.

00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:50.863
If ω_1 -
ω_2 is a very

00:44:50.863 --> 00:44:53.522
small number,
this cosine here is changing

00:44:53.522 --> 00:44:56.799
very, very slowly;
this cosine is oscillating at

00:44:56.799 --> 00:45:00.243
roughly the--it's oscillating at
the average of the two

00:45:00.243 --> 00:45:02.869
frequencies.
So, if one was 401,

00:45:02.869 --> 00:45:06.648
and one was 399,
this is oscillating at 400,

00:45:06.648 --> 00:45:11.218
but here ω_1 -
ω_2 is 2,

00:45:11.218 --> 00:45:14.467
divided by 2 is 1.
So, it's oscillating much

00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:17.573
slower.
So, what will you get if you

00:45:17.573 --> 00:45:20.472
plot this?
Think of the whole thing as an

00:45:20.472 --> 00:45:23.100
amplitude that's slowly varying
with time.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.969
So, we have done it the other
day when I wrote e to the

00:45:29.969 --> 00:45:32.469
minus γ,
t over 2 times some

00:45:32.469 --> 00:45:34.719
cos ωt;
this is an envelope that

00:45:34.719 --> 00:45:37.138
controls the amplitude.
That day it was falling

00:45:37.138 --> 00:45:39.565
monotonically,
but here it'll oscillate very

00:45:39.565 --> 00:45:41.938
slowly.
So, let me plot this cosine

00:45:41.938 --> 00:45:44.113
here.
This is just the amplitude,

00:45:44.113 --> 00:45:47.528
but with that amplitude,
this guy is oscillating like

00:45:47.528 --> 00:45:49.833
crazy.
So, what I do mean to convey is

00:45:49.833 --> 00:45:52.100
that you'll have oscillations
like this.

00:45:59.719 --> 00:46:02.108
So, it'll be loud,
silent, loud,

00:46:02.108 --> 00:46:03.880
silent, loud,
silent.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.520
So, you will hear another beat,
this is called a beat,

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.505
in which you will hear a hum in
which together they add and

00:46:11.505 --> 00:46:15.848
cancel, add and cancel.
And we want to calculate the

00:46:15.848 --> 00:46:19.255
beat frequency.
Now, the first guess is to say

00:46:19.255 --> 00:46:22.431
the frequency of the beat is
(ω_1 -

00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:26.005
ω_2) over2,
because that's what seems to

00:46:26.005 --> 00:46:27.952
appear here.
But actually,

00:46:27.952 --> 00:46:31.052
the correct answer is the beat
frequency is simply

00:46:31.052 --> 00:46:33.710
ω_1 -
ω_2.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:36.653
And I will tell you why.
At t = 0,

00:46:36.653 --> 00:46:41.429
when the cosine had a value 1,
you got an amplitude 2A.

00:46:41.429 --> 00:46:46.920
Wait till ω_1 -
ω_2 over 2 is not

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:50.789
equal to 2π,
but equal to π,

00:46:50.789 --> 00:46:54.817
I mean times t.
If this whole combination is

00:46:54.817 --> 00:46:57.771
equal to π,
this number becomes a negative

00:46:57.771 --> 00:47:01.750
number of ψ's 2A,
but that just means it's here.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:05.356
But if you multiply that huge
negative number by the cosine,

00:47:05.356 --> 00:47:08.839
it is still oscillating very
wildly here, as much as it is

00:47:08.839 --> 00:47:10.690
here.
In other words,

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:16.239
5 cos ωt and -5 cos
ωt have the same amplitude.

00:47:16.239 --> 00:47:19.769
The minus doesn't change the
fact that it's having large

00:47:19.769 --> 00:47:22.079
excursions from plus 5 to minus
5.

00:47:22.079 --> 00:47:26.000
So in other words,
I'm telling you to compare some

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.360
answer like this,
5 cos 400t,

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:33.820
-5 cos 400t.
Plot this and plot this;

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.132
you'll find if 400t is
very rapid oscillations,

00:47:37.132 --> 00:47:39.820
this has an amplitude as big as
this one.

00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:41.710
And the ear is just picking up
the amplitude;

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:43.760
the ear is not picking up
anything else.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.822
The ear is just picking up the
loudness of the sound,

00:47:46.822 --> 00:47:49.650
so it will seem to be loud now
and loud there.

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:52.807
But once you've gone from here
to here, you only had to change

00:47:52.807 --> 00:47:55.653
the argument of this whole thing
by π and not by

00:47:55.653 --> 00:47:58.851
2π.
That's why the beat frequency

00:47:58.851 --> 00:48:03.610
then happens to be simply the
difference in frequencies.

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:08.793
Or I ask you to do another
thing, if you're not happy with

00:48:08.793 --> 00:48:10.757
this.
Go home and do the following

00:48:10.757 --> 00:48:11.941
thing.
One is vibrating as

00:48:11.941 --> 00:48:14.094
ω_1t,
the other is vibrating as

00:48:14.094 --> 00:48:17.404
ω_2t.
Find out when the difference

00:48:17.404 --> 00:48:21.079
between the phase angles is
equal to π;

00:48:21.079 --> 00:48:25.410
that's when this guy and that
guy will cancel each other;

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:29.057
that's when you come here.
Then, you ask yourself when

00:48:29.057 --> 00:48:32.119
they'll come back to where they
are, 2π.

00:48:32.119 --> 00:48:35.210
Ask for when the difference in
phase is 2π and you will

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:38.151
find that that occurs at the
frequency, which is what I told

00:48:38.151 --> 00:48:39.904
you.
So whether you can,

00:48:39.904 --> 00:48:43.681
if you found this factor of 2
confusing, you've got to

00:48:43.681 --> 00:48:46.389
understand the argument I gave
you.

00:48:46.389 --> 00:48:50.101
That in order for this thing to
sound just as loud as it did at

00:48:50.101 --> 00:48:52.489
t = 0,
it's not necessary that this

00:48:52.489 --> 00:48:55.469
number come to 2A,
it's good enough if it comes to

00:48:55.469 --> 00:48:57.925
minus 2A;
because minus 2A times

00:48:57.925 --> 00:49:00.267
the rapid cosine,
which is oscillating on top of

00:49:00.267 --> 00:49:02.410
the minus 2, will also look like
plus 2;

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:05.815
you cannot tell the difference.
So, beat frequencies are used

00:49:05.815 --> 00:49:09.163
to tune instruments.
So, what the piano tuner does

00:49:09.163 --> 00:49:12.618
is to strike the fork,
and strike that thing on the

00:49:12.618 --> 00:49:16.394
piano and listen to the two,
if they're not quite matched,

00:49:16.394 --> 00:49:19.719
you'll hear a slow hum that
goes up and down in intensity.

00:49:19.719 --> 00:49:22.369
You keep on fiddling with it
till it goes away.

00:49:22.369 --> 00:49:25.059
That's when you match the two
frequencies.

00:49:25.059 --> 00:49:29.519
So, beat frequencies have a lot
of interesting applications in

00:49:29.519 --> 00:49:32.097
physics.
In fact, when you go to a radio

00:49:32.097 --> 00:49:34.422
station, you know,
this station is what,

00:49:34.422 --> 00:49:37.679
960 megahertz or something.
No way your ears can hear that.

00:49:37.679 --> 00:49:39.260
That's not a frequency of the
sound;

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.969
that's a frequency of the
signal, called a carrier wave.

00:49:43.969 --> 00:49:45.870
Then, you modulate with that,
with something,

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.740
and you produce a beat.
It's the beats that we are able

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.671
to hear.
Anyway, this is something

00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:55.530
fairly simple,
a trigonometric problem.

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.788
Now, I will do a slightly more
complicated problem,

00:49:58.788 --> 00:50:01.070
where I'm going to add two
waves.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:04.539
And we'll do a lot more of this
in the next term but right now

00:50:04.539 --> 00:50:07.440
you're supposed to have first
pass at this topic;

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.090
this is called a double slit
experiment.

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:15.888
You have a source of waves here.
The source is so far away that

00:50:15.888 --> 00:50:19.710
you can treat these to be just
parallel lines,

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:23.322
and you hit a double slip,
namely, an impenetrable barrier

00:50:23.322 --> 00:50:26.388
with two holes in it.
If you want think of it as

00:50:26.388 --> 00:50:29.666
water waves, and you've erected
a wall on your estate,

00:50:29.666 --> 00:50:32.923
where there are two holes.
So, you know what'll happen,

00:50:32.923 --> 00:50:35.011
right?
These two holes will themselves

00:50:35.011 --> 00:50:36.900
start generating their own
waves.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.949
And you want to stand on a line
here, go up and down and ask

00:50:41.949 --> 00:50:45.030
what's the water doing where I
am.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:51.980
So, first take a point exactly
midway between these two points.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.510
What are you getting?
You are getting a signal from

00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:59.420
here, and you're getting a
signal from here.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.394
One signal travels that way;
the other travels that way

00:51:02.394 --> 00:51:05.785
[pointing at diagram on board].
Do you understand that because

00:51:05.785 --> 00:51:09.896
you're symmetrically located,
the two signals will be in step

00:51:09.896 --> 00:51:13.951
when they come to you?
Because they were on step when

00:51:13.951 --> 00:51:18.477
this front hit this double hole,
and started making its own

00:51:18.477 --> 00:51:21.173
waves.
So, these waves are emitted in

00:51:21.173 --> 00:51:24.229
step, they march along and come
to you without,

00:51:24.229 --> 00:51:27.241
with the same time delay.
So, when a crest from this

00:51:27.241 --> 00:51:29.234
reaches you, a crest from that
will reach you,

00:51:29.234 --> 00:51:30.739
trough reaches,
trough reaches.

00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:32.530
So, you'll just double the
answer.

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:35.115
So here you will get,
ψ will become

00:51:35.115 --> 00:51:38.070
2ψ, or A will
become 2A.

00:51:38.070 --> 00:51:40.527
If you have an amplitude
A from this and A

00:51:40.527 --> 00:51:42.360
from this, you will get
2A here.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.880
So, the water will be very
choppy there.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:47.920
If you're living on a little
boat, the boat will rock up and

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.083
down with amplitude 2A.
If you shut off this hole,

00:51:51.083 --> 00:51:54.167
the amplitude will go back to
just that from one hole,

00:51:54.167 --> 00:51:56.480
it'll be A;
2 gives you 2A.

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.860
That's what makes a lot of
common sense.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:02.987
But pick another point here,
I will tell you how to pick

00:52:02.987 --> 00:52:07.039
that point, so that these two
lengths are not equal.

00:52:07.039 --> 00:52:09.213
So, let's call that length
L_1 and length

00:52:09.213 --> 00:52:11.479
L_2.
Suppose L_1 -

00:52:11.479 --> 00:52:13.470
L_2 is half a
wavelength.

00:52:17.449 --> 00:52:20.703
As you know between every two
crests there is a trough where

00:52:20.703 --> 00:52:23.846
the function is minus the
amplitude, at the crest is equal

00:52:23.846 --> 00:52:27.252
to plus the amplitude.
So, if you're half a wavelength

00:52:27.252 --> 00:52:31.133
apart, when a crest from here
appears, a trough from here will

00:52:31.133 --> 00:52:32.664
appear.
When a trough from here

00:52:32.664 --> 00:52:34.219
appears, a crest from here will
appear.

00:52:34.219 --> 00:52:36.955
In fact in every instant,
whatever comes here,

00:52:36.955 --> 00:52:41.409
minus of that will come here.
Let's understand why.

00:52:41.409 --> 00:52:45.839
The way the wave travels is
2πx over λ,

00:52:45.839 --> 00:52:49.530
where x is,
say, measured from here.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:52.335
For the other guy,
it is 2π times x

00:52:52.335 --> 00:52:54.970
prime over λ,
or x prime at that

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:58.464
length.
If that length is longer than

00:52:58.464 --> 00:53:03.404
this, by λ over 2,
if this is x plus

00:53:03.404 --> 00:53:07.257
λ over 2,
look what you're getting extra:

00:53:07.257 --> 00:53:10.650
2π times λ over
2 divided by λ,

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:19.110
is really cosine of π,
plus what the other person got.

00:53:19.110 --> 00:53:22.557
But cosine of π added to
π added to anything

00:53:22.557 --> 00:53:25.010
changes the cosine to minus
itself.

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:27.898
So, the way to think about it
is when you're half a wavelength

00:53:27.898 --> 00:53:30.124
behind coming from here,
whatever this one does,

00:53:30.124 --> 00:53:32.887
this does minus of that.
Because shifting by half a

00:53:32.887 --> 00:53:35.539
wavelength is adding a π
to the cosine;

00:53:35.539 --> 00:53:37.905
adding a π to the
cosine changes it to minus its

00:53:37.905 --> 00:53:40.555
value at every instant.
Not only does crest come with

00:53:40.555 --> 00:53:43.218
trough and trough comes with
crest, every possible

00:53:43.218 --> 00:53:45.990
displacement comes with minus of
that from here,

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.587
and you get nothing here.
So, this is called an

00:53:49.587 --> 00:53:52.891
interference minimum.
Or we say, here the

00:53:52.891 --> 00:53:56.481
interference is constructive,
and here we say the

00:53:56.481 --> 00:53:58.800
interference is destructive.

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:07.219
How will you find the point of
destructive interference?

00:54:07.219 --> 00:54:10.340
It's a matter of simple
geometry.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.340
You measure that length,
and you measure that length;

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:16.690
take the difference and set it
equal to λ over 2.

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:20.570
That's the first destructive
interference.

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:22.850
That's a very interesting point
to sit in.

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:26.288
Look what it's telling you.
It says if you sit here with

00:54:26.288 --> 00:54:29.972
your boat, the boat won't move
at all, even though there are

00:54:29.972 --> 00:54:32.719
two holes letting waves in at
that point.

00:54:32.719 --> 00:54:35.280
That's the principle behind
noise cancellation.

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:39.103
You can actually cancel one
sound with another sound if you

00:54:39.103 --> 00:54:42.070
bring the second sound off by
half a cycle.

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:46.531
So that if you had only one
hole in the wall that you'd

00:54:46.531 --> 00:54:50.579
built between your little estate
and the beach,

00:54:50.579 --> 00:54:53.114
and the waves from here were
rocking the boat,

00:54:53.114 --> 00:54:56.268
miraculously putting a second
hole at the right place can

00:54:56.268 --> 00:54:58.690
actually calm the waters where
you are.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.180
And the minute somebody blocks
one of these holes,

00:55:02.180 --> 00:55:05.599
the water will get choppy again
where you are.

00:55:05.599 --> 00:55:08.845
It's the property of waves that
two waves can lead to nothing,

00:55:08.845 --> 00:55:12.091
but one wave cannot because two
waves have a chance of working

00:55:12.091 --> 00:55:14.059
against each other and
canceling.

00:55:14.059 --> 00:55:16.929
This is something you've got to
get very straight.

00:55:16.929 --> 00:55:22.350
Now, if I go further up here,
until I reach a point where the

00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:27.228
difference in those two lengths
is the full wavelength,

00:55:27.228 --> 00:55:32.288
then I'm back to being in step.
Of course, a full wavelength

00:55:32.288 --> 00:55:35.406
means that these are not doing
the same length,

00:55:35.406 --> 00:55:39.269
but this is differing from that
by a whole wavelength.

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:42.344
That means when the 13^(th)
wave from here arrives,

00:55:42.344 --> 00:55:45.480
the 14^(th) or the 12^(th) from
here will arrive.

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.654
But we don't care,
as long as a crest comes with a

00:55:47.654 --> 00:55:50.590
crest;
we're happy where we are.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:52.913
So things get--start with
constructive,

00:55:52.913 --> 00:55:54.441
destructive,
constructive,

00:55:54.441 --> 00:55:57.671
destructive;
it oscillates both above and

00:55:57.671 --> 00:55:59.989
below the midpoint.
Yes?

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:02.722
Student: How is the
amplitude of the wave,

00:56:02.722 --> 00:56:05.340
once it goes through that
amplitude [inaudible]

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:08.300
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It could be,

00:56:08.300 --> 00:56:11.526
it need not be the same.
It all depends on the aperture

00:56:11.526 --> 00:56:13.908
and so on.
But what is clear by symmetry

00:56:13.908 --> 00:56:16.500
is that these two have the same
amplitude.

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.608
In practice,
we believe the amplitude will

00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:20.870
also be the same,
because amplitude has to be

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:23.030
continuous when you go through a
slit.

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:25.848
The water cannot be jumping up
by two inches before the slit,

00:56:25.848 --> 00:56:28.620
and suddenly on the other side
jump to different lengths.

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:32.420
Amplitude is always continuous.
So in fact, this amplitude and

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:36.797
that amplitude will be equal.
You can also see from the wave

00:56:36.797 --> 00:56:40.320
equation if the ψ was
not continuous;

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:43.633
dψ/dx will be infinity.
There's no room for any

00:56:43.633 --> 00:56:46.550
infinities in the equations.
ψ will be continuous;

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:48.761
in fact--Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:50.210
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Here?

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:52.017
Student: Yes.
Professor Ramamurti

00:56:52.017 --> 00:56:54.101
Shankar: You're not able to
read this equation,

00:56:54.101 --> 00:56:55.559
because it's very badly
written.

00:56:55.559 --> 00:56:57.030
Let me tell you what I tried to
do.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:57:01.760
Cos 2πx over
λ;

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:04.771
let's pick a certain time,
so that I don't worry about

00:57:04.771 --> 00:57:07.504
ωt.
In fact, let me write it as

00:57:07.504 --> 00:57:12.125
L_1.
The other one is cos

00:57:12.125 --> 00:57:16.230
2π,
L_2/λ.

00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:20.081
I'm adding two waves.
Suppose L_2 =

00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:23.119
L_1 plus half a
wavelength.

00:57:23.119 --> 00:57:26.461
Then, this one becomes
cos 2π

00:57:26.461 --> 00:57:33.139
L_1/λ + π.
Right?

00:57:33.139 --> 00:57:35.000
L_2 = L_1 +
λ/2.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.030
This is the
L_1.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:38.091
If you put a λ/2,
times 2π over

00:57:38.091 --> 00:57:41.060
λ, you get a π.
Then, you've got to understand

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.296
that whenever you add a
π to a cosine,

00:57:43.296 --> 00:57:45.829
you get minus the cosine,
without the π.

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:49.324
There you can see this guy is
producing a signal,

00:57:49.324 --> 00:57:52.309
which is exactly the minus of
that guy.

00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:56.908
I did this at t = 0,
but you can put an ωt

00:57:56.908 --> 00:57:59.278
to both.
But nothing changes the fact

00:57:59.278 --> 00:58:02.210
that when you subtract the same
ωt from the 2,

00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:05.632
it doesn't change anything.
So, I didn't worry about the

00:58:05.632 --> 00:58:07.090
time.
It's the spatial mismatch

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:08.170
that's the problem here.

00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:15.821
Okay, now sometimes people
write this formula for

00:58:15.821 --> 00:58:19.719
destructive and constructive
interference as follows.

00:58:19.719 --> 00:58:23.809
There's an approximate formula
that's very handy.

00:58:23.809 --> 00:58:26.610
The correct way to do this of
course is simply measure that

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:29.025
distance and that distance and
take the difference,

00:58:29.025 --> 00:58:30.805
okay?
In other words,

00:58:30.805 --> 00:58:34.840
if L_1 -
L_2 = mλ,

00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:39.355
where m is an integer,
1,2 et cetera,

00:58:39.355 --> 00:58:42.764
or plus minus 1,
plus minus 2,

00:58:42.764 --> 00:58:47.111
it is constructive.
If it's a half integer,

00:58:47.111 --> 00:58:50.786
which we like to denote as
follows: m + ½

00:58:50.786 --> 00:58:54.002
λ, again m = 0
plus minus 1,

00:58:54.002 --> 00:58:58.628
et cetera is destructive.
The way of writing--m is

00:58:58.628 --> 00:59:02.610
usually the standard symbol
people use for integers;

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:05.309
m and n are
common symbols for integers.

00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:07.905
So, if the path difference is
an integer multiple of

00:59:07.905 --> 00:59:11.051
λ, it's harmless;
if it is a half-integer

00:59:11.051 --> 00:59:13.748
multiple of λ,
it's harmful,

00:59:13.748 --> 00:59:16.952
meaning destructive.
The whole approximation has to

00:59:16.952 --> 00:59:19.530
do with what is L_1
- L_2.

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:22.079
One is to actually measure
these lengths exactly,

00:59:22.079 --> 00:59:25.908
and using Pythagoras' Theorem,
given the difference between

00:59:25.908 --> 00:59:29.329
the slits, given the distance to
the screen.

00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:33.528
If that distance is d,
one can do the math and

00:59:33.528 --> 00:59:36.400
calculate it.
But here's what people do.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.769
They say imagine this screen is
very, very far away.

00:59:39.769 --> 00:59:43.219
Very far away so that the rays
leaving this are actually

00:59:43.219 --> 00:59:46.982
parallel because they meet at
infinity, and that's where your

00:59:46.982 --> 00:59:49.600
screen is.
It's not really at infinity but

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.510
it's far enough for this
purpose.

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:56.010
Then, you can tell very easily
that the extra length traveled

00:59:56.010 --> 00:59:58.860
by this wave is just this part
here.

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:01.860
Do you see that?
Because this part cancels out.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.539
So, drop a perpendicular here,
those two are equal in length

01:00:04.539 --> 01:00:07.010
going out in infinity;
that's the extra section.

01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:10.382
How long is the extra section?
With that as d,

01:00:10.382 --> 01:00:14.003
distance between the slits,
if that angle is θ

01:00:14.003 --> 01:00:17.082
here,
then we say d sin

01:00:17.082 --> 01:00:22.429
θ is = L_1
- L_2.

01:00:22.429 --> 01:00:26.596
And that's what you want to be
either mλ or (m +

01:00:26.596 --> 01:00:28.814
½)λ,
for constructive and

01:00:28.814 --> 01:00:31.599
destructive.
But there's a way to relate

01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:34.070
this θ here to this
direction.

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:38.321
They are the same angle.
You may want to go look at your

01:00:38.321 --> 01:00:41.809
book where the graphics are
better than mine.

01:00:41.809 --> 01:00:45.324
But I'm telling you the same
old trick we used from incline

01:00:45.324 --> 01:00:47.086
planes.
If you got two lines,

01:00:47.086 --> 01:00:49.926
this line and this line,
the angle between them is

01:00:49.926 --> 01:00:52.149
θ,
then the perpendicular of the

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:54.380
two lines have the same angle
between them.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:58.415
Perpendicular to this line is
this one, and perpendicular to

01:00:58.415 --> 01:01:00.809
the screen is the horizontal
one.

01:01:00.809 --> 01:01:02.730
So, θ is also that
angle.

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:06.220
Therefore, the way you will do
any of these problems is,

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:10.091
suppose someone says find out
when I get the first destructive

01:01:10.091 --> 01:01:13.205
interference,
given that length to the

01:01:13.205 --> 01:01:17.530
screen, and someone says,
"How far should I move?"

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:19.635
What you do is,
you say d is the

01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:22.794
distance between the two slits,
sin θ equal to say

01:01:22.794 --> 01:01:24.900
λ over 2,
for destructive.

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:28.291
Solve for θ.
Because the d is known,

01:01:28.291 --> 01:01:31.066
sin θ is not known,
you want it to be λ

01:01:31.066 --> 01:01:33.989
over 2;
λ will be given to you.

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:37.430
Once you get the angle,
you're basically telling the

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.275
person to go at that angle,
and that's where the intensity

01:01:41.275 --> 01:01:44.533
will be a minimum.
But then, it's trigonometry to

01:01:44.533 --> 01:01:48.199
understand that d over
L is just tan θ.

01:01:48.199 --> 01:01:50.246
So, if you knew θ,
you can find D over

01:01:50.246 --> 01:01:53.652
L.
So, D over L is

01:01:53.652 --> 01:01:55.190
tan θ.

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.478
So, the problems you can get
are either λ is given to

01:02:06.478 --> 01:02:08.349
you and θ has to be
found,

01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:10.130
or θ is given to you,
λ has to be found.

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:13.649
Somebody can say in some
experiment with waves I find the

01:02:13.649 --> 01:02:16.980
first minimum at that angle,
what's the wavelength?

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:19.519
The distance between the slits
is so and so.

01:02:19.519 --> 01:02:22.300
But the basic idea is really to
find the path lengths;

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:25.352
take the difference,
set it equal to either integer

01:02:25.352 --> 01:02:28.650
multiple or half integer
multiple of the wavelength.

01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:32.888
Okay, last of the interference
problems has to do with all

01:02:32.888 --> 01:02:36.680
these musical instruments,
and it goes like this.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.538
Take a string.
Now, there's a wall here and

01:02:42.538 --> 01:02:46.670
you start shaking it,
and ask what happens.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:50.169
So, let's say I shake it just
once, and it sent a pulse like

01:02:50.169 --> 01:02:53.177
this, moving to the right.
Well, this pulse,

01:02:53.177 --> 01:02:57.300
by the time it gets to this
place where the string is

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:01.820
anchored and not free to move,
it cannot vibrate here.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:06.003
So, how is that going to happen?
Well, some forces will be

01:03:06.003 --> 01:03:09.208
exerted on the string by the
wall to make sure that the

01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:12.626
signal the wall sends out,
along with the signal you send

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:15.170
out, add up to zero at the point
of contact,

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:17.400
because no vibration there is
allowed.

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.313
And the result of that is that
when a signal goes out like

01:03:21.313 --> 01:03:25.432
this, it comes out reflected in
direction and inverted in its

01:03:25.432 --> 01:03:26.050
sign.

01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:34.517
For those of you who wanted
more satisfactory proof of this,

01:03:34.517 --> 01:03:37.889
let me say the following.
Suppose there is no wall.

01:03:37.889 --> 01:03:41.871
I saw you send a signal,
and I manufacture a mirror

01:03:41.871 --> 01:03:46.570
image of that to the right,
traveling towards this point.

01:03:46.570 --> 01:03:50.075
The two are coming near each
other, and when they meet,

01:03:50.075 --> 01:03:53.969
by design, I've arranged it so
that this one and this one,

01:03:53.969 --> 01:03:56.854
when they overlap,
are exactly opposite of each

01:03:56.854 --> 01:04:00.239
other, so that they cancel each
other at this point.

01:04:00.239 --> 01:04:03.378
Then, they go through each
other, and this will come out

01:04:03.378 --> 01:04:05.489
here, that'll go to the other
side.

01:04:05.489 --> 01:04:08.741
But throughout this encounter
-- here's the punch line --

01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:12.050
throughout the encounter this
point was not asked to move,

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:14.139
because the two waves
cancelled.

01:04:14.139 --> 01:04:16.332
That means even if I put my
finger there,

01:04:16.332 --> 01:04:19.621
it won't make a difference to
this problem because that point

01:04:19.621 --> 01:04:23.015
is not planning to move anyway.
It also means that if you put a

01:04:23.015 --> 01:04:25.490
barrier here that doesn't allow
the string to move;

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:29.416
it doesn't change the outcome.
That's the reason we convince

01:04:29.416 --> 01:04:33.117
ourselves that the incoming
pulse this way comes out that

01:04:33.117 --> 01:04:36.746
way.
Okay, now what I want to study

01:04:36.746 --> 01:04:42.868
is not a single one-shot pulse,
but a pulse that looks like

01:04:42.868 --> 01:04:46.880
this, A cos kx -
ωt.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.380
A continuous signal goes in,
how does it come out?

01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:55.449
It comes out as [-A]
cos ωt + kx.

01:04:55.449 --> 01:05:00.225
So, I've reversed the amplitude
and I've reversed the direction

01:05:00.225 --> 01:05:03.276
of motion.
So, this is a result of an

01:05:03.276 --> 01:05:06.958
incoming wave,
and the one that's sent back by

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:09.460
the wall;
together they coexist.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.466
But that goes in and that comes
out, and together they form what

01:05:12.466 --> 01:05:15.233
I will find in this region.
I keep sending stuff to the

01:05:15.233 --> 01:05:17.487
wall, the wall keeps sending
that back to me,

01:05:17.487 --> 01:05:20.727
and both exist.
Well, you've got to do another

01:05:20.727 --> 01:05:24.898
trigonometric identity,
to show you that this is really

01:05:24.898 --> 01:05:28.219
2A sin kx,
sin ωt.

01:05:28.219 --> 01:05:32.260
I don't want to go through the
trigonometric identity.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.524
But what I want you to notice
then, is that the resulting

01:05:35.524 --> 01:05:38.321
physics looks like this.
Here is the wall,

01:05:38.321 --> 01:05:42.242
at a given point x,
the amplitude is 2A sin

01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:46.539
kx, and it oscillates with a
frequency ωt.

01:05:46.539 --> 01:05:48.628
And if you draw it sin
kx, it's going to look like

01:05:48.628 --> 01:05:48.890
this.

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:57.692
So, whenever kx = π,
if kx = π where that

01:05:57.692 --> 01:06:01.790
distance is λ/2,
there is no vibration.

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:04.010
There is no vibration.
This is called a node;

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:08.634
in between is an anti-node.
This kind of thing will be set

01:06:08.634 --> 01:06:12.639
up all the way back.
Now you see what that means.

01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:14.690
So, this point is not going to
vibrate.

01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:19.288
If I put another barrier here,
it won't make any difference,

01:06:19.288 --> 01:06:23.341
because that point is--these
two waves add up to zero

01:06:23.341 --> 01:06:27.422
identically at that point.
If you put your finger there it

01:06:27.422 --> 01:06:29.627
won't matter.
So, in addition to making no

01:06:29.627 --> 01:06:31.601
difference if you hold the
string there,

01:06:31.601 --> 01:06:33.929
it also doesn't matter if you
hold it here.

01:06:33.929 --> 01:06:39.072
So, what that means is that if
you turn the problem around and

01:06:39.072 --> 01:06:42.949
say, look, I give you the
following problem,

01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:46.210
I give you a string which is
clamped at these two ends,

01:06:46.210 --> 01:06:49.170
what are the possible
vibrations of the string?

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:52.139
They have to look like the
following.

01:06:52.139 --> 01:06:55.304
Your string length has to be
equal to that or that or any of

01:06:55.304 --> 01:06:59.083
these multiples.
That means what can happen in

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:03.449
your string is either that,
or it can do that,

01:07:03.449 --> 01:07:08.010
or something with more and more
lobes in it.

01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:11.118
These are the allowed modes of
vibration of the string,

01:07:11.118 --> 01:07:14.343
fixed at two ends.
What I want to extract from

01:07:14.343 --> 01:07:18.645
this is what sound will you
hear, what frequency will you

01:07:18.645 --> 01:07:20.683
hear.
So, you have--this is the

01:07:20.683 --> 01:07:23.699
family of problems that you guys
are expected to do.

01:07:23.699 --> 01:07:25.260
So, you have to think as
follows.

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.472
That is the length.
How is the length related to

01:07:28.472 --> 01:07:31.471
the wavelength,
that's all you got to figure

01:07:31.471 --> 01:07:33.578
out.
Is it clear to you guys that

01:07:33.578 --> 01:07:37.260
this is half a wavelength?
If you've got that, you're home.

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.230
Because you're saying half a
wavelength is equal to L,

01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.309
or the wavelength is equal to
2L;

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:45.129
the frequency is the velocity
of sound divided by the

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:48.219
wavelength, which is the
velocity divided by 2L.

01:07:48.219 --> 01:07:51.360
That's the frequency you will
hear from this guy.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.946
When it vibrates like this,
I think it's clear to you that

01:07:54.946 --> 01:07:58.909
it's gone through one full cycle
here, this is λ = L.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:02.216
You do the whole thing you will
find frequency is now

01:08:02.216 --> 01:08:05.650
v/L, which is two times
the lowest frequency,

01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:07.264
which we denote by
f_0,

01:08:07.264 --> 01:08:08.920
which means the fundamental
frequency.

01:08:14.719 --> 01:08:16.380
So, the bottom line is very
simple.

01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.394
A string clamped at two ends,
and has length L,

01:08:19.394 --> 01:08:22.636
can only vibrate in either the
fundamental frequency or an

01:08:22.636 --> 01:08:25.479
integer multiple of the
fundamental frequency.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:28.098
And when it does that,
the two ends of the string will

01:08:28.098 --> 01:08:31.310
be nodes, and you can have any
number of anti-nodes in between,

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:33.409
provided you start with a node
and end with a node.

01:08:33.409 --> 01:08:37.060
Now, this is also valid in the
following problem.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.779
Take a tube,
clamped [correction:

01:08:38.779 --> 01:08:40.821
should have said blocked]
at both ends,

01:08:40.821 --> 01:08:43.885
and there are some longitudinal
sound waves going back and

01:08:43.885 --> 01:08:45.885
forth.
This is transverse waves on a

01:08:45.885 --> 01:08:47.657
string;
this is sound waves going back

01:08:47.657 --> 01:08:49.769
and forth.
You realize the sound waves

01:08:49.769 --> 01:08:53.322
going back and forth cannot go
back and forth at this wall or

01:08:53.322 --> 01:08:55.715
at this wall.
Therefore, the motion of the

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:58.916
air molecules has to have a node
here and it has to have a node

01:08:58.916 --> 01:09:01.532
here.
So, the possible modes of

01:09:01.532 --> 01:09:05.850
vibration for sound also look
exactly like this.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:10.665
The frequencies will be the
same for vibrations on a tube,

01:09:10.665 --> 01:09:13.355
closed at two ends.
The only subtlety,

01:09:13.355 --> 01:09:15.339
which I don't want you to
forget--;Here,

01:09:15.339 --> 01:09:18.443
the picture really talks about
the string moving perpendicular

01:09:18.443 --> 01:09:20.984
to the length.
This does not indicate here

01:09:20.984 --> 01:09:23.609
that the sound,
the air molecules are going up

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:25.968
and down.
This is the amplitude for

01:09:25.968 --> 01:09:29.067
longitudinal vibration.
If this number is three inches,

01:09:29.067 --> 01:09:32.033
it means the molecules here are
moving back and forth by three

01:09:32.033 --> 01:09:34.138
inches.
So, we just out of habit plot

01:09:34.138 --> 01:09:37.252
everything on the y axis;
that doesn't mean the motion is

01:09:37.252 --> 01:09:39.672
in the y direction.
For a longitudinal wave the

01:09:39.672 --> 01:09:42.039
motion is side-to-side;
this is the extent of

01:09:42.039 --> 01:09:45.494
side-to-side motion.
So, the only problem where you

01:09:45.494 --> 01:09:48.350
may get stumped is the following
one.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.140
I will tell you how to do that
and then we are done.

01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:57.854
Take a tube, like this.
It's closed here and it's open

01:09:57.854 --> 01:10:00.165
here.
You know, take a Coke bottle or

01:10:00.165 --> 01:10:03.310
something and try to blow on it;
you hear a certain sound.

01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:05.630
Why is it picking that one
frequency?

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.189
That's what I want to
understand.

01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:10.222
Now, since I'm making the noise
here, here is where the

01:10:10.222 --> 01:10:13.637
amplitude will be the biggest,
and of course there's nothing

01:10:13.637 --> 01:10:16.148
doing at this end,
because that's a wall which

01:10:16.148 --> 01:10:19.729
cannot go back and forth.
So, what pattern can I draw?

01:10:19.729 --> 01:10:21.220
Take a minute and think about
it.

01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:23.909
I want a maximum vibration
here, nothing here.

01:10:23.909 --> 01:10:27.159
The lowest one I can draw looks
like that.

01:10:27.159 --> 01:10:31.867
The next one I can draw is
constrained to have a maximum

01:10:31.867 --> 01:10:35.119
here and then a minimum at that
end.

01:10:35.119 --> 01:10:39.272
Now, what is the relation of
the length of the tube to the

01:10:39.272 --> 01:10:41.792
wavelength?
I think you can see the length

01:10:41.792 --> 01:10:44.099
of the tube is now a quarter of
a wavelength,

01:10:44.099 --> 01:10:47.213
it's not from here to the top.
Coming down is the other

01:10:47.213 --> 01:10:49.750
quarter and then the other half
is missing.

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:53.230
So, what's the frequency?
It's equal to v/λ;

01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:59.683
it's going to be 4v/L.
I'm getting the frequency to be

01:10:59.683 --> 01:11:03.980
velocity divided by wavelength,
and I bet you will get this.

01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:07.432
Oh, did I get it wrong?
Oh yes, I'm sorry,

01:11:07.432 --> 01:11:12.230
it's v/4L.
4L is λ.

01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:16.295
Now, what's the answer here?
What is the relation of the

01:11:16.295 --> 01:11:20.076
length to wavelength?
The length happens to be a half

01:11:20.076 --> 01:11:24.750
a cycle plus another quarter,
is 3/4^(th) of λ.

01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:27.924
And the frequency,
if you do this,

01:11:27.924 --> 01:11:32.150
will be 3v/4L.
And this is all I want you to

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:34.451
notice.
That in this peculiar problem

01:11:34.451 --> 01:11:37.314
where one end is open and one
end is closed,

01:11:37.314 --> 01:11:40.711
the frequencies are odd
multiples of the fundamental

01:11:40.711 --> 01:11:42.528
frequency,
3 times that,

01:11:42.528 --> 01:11:44.289
5 times that,
7 times that.

01:11:44.289 --> 01:11:47.049
And in exams,
you can be asked a variety of

01:11:47.049 --> 01:11:50.859
questions, either this one or
some other exam you take some

01:11:50.859 --> 01:11:53.647
time later in life.
You should be able to do

01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:55.510
the--Let me do one practice
thing.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:59.483
Here's a tube open at both ends.
Draw me the lowest frequency

01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:02.433
you can draw.
I want an anti-node here,

01:12:02.433 --> 01:12:06.030
an anti-node here,
but between them I got to have

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.130
a node.
So, it'll look like that.

01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:10.239
Then, you can draw more
complicated patterns,

01:12:10.239 --> 01:12:12.109
provided the two ends look like
this.

01:12:12.109 --> 01:12:16.910
And I think you can see here,
that this is half a wavelength.

01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:21.416
So, L = λ over 2.
And again, you will find here

01:12:21.416 --> 01:12:24.130
all frequencies are integer
multiples of the fundamental.

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:27.166
So, the story is this,
as long as the two ends are the

01:12:27.166 --> 01:12:30.489
same, both open or both closed,
all frequencies are integer

01:12:30.489 --> 01:12:32.609
multiples of the fundamental
one.

01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:35.554
If you got a funny situation,
one end is open and one end is

01:12:35.554 --> 01:12:38.250
closed, you'll get odd multiples
of the fundamental.

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:42.529
But I think you might have to
go do some reading in the book.

01:12:42.529 --> 01:12:44.630
I don't have a better way to
explain this,

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:47.140
and this is somewhat easier
part of the course,

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:51.401
and I think you should try to
be on top of this particular

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:52.401
topic.

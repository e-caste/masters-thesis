00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:04.333
PAUL FREEDMAN: Today,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:09.367
we move back to Northern Europe
to the northern part of

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:11.300
the former Roman Empire.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.800
And since you've done the
reading, I won't be giving

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.433
anything away by saying that the
culmination of what we're

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:22.433
talking about is Charlemagne and
Charlemagne's coronation

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.767
in Rome at the hands
of the Pope in

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:30.533
the year 800 as emperor.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:33.467
We'll talk about what that
title means, a title that had

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:41.300
not been seen in 325 years in
the West, at least not agreed

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.100
upon by everyone in
Western Europe.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.967
Charlemagne, at this time,
didn't control quite

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:50.433
everything in Western Europe.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:55.067
You have a map in the Wickham
book of his empire, bequeathed

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:59.600
to his successors in the year
843, the year that it is

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.833
partitioned.

00:01:00.833 --> 00:01:06.367
This does not include
the British Isles.

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:09.233
It does not include most
of Spain, which

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.500
was in Islamic hands.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.033
But it is a pretty convincing
effort at the restoration of

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:21.167
the Roman Empire, even
though its base--

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:25.067
in other words, where
Charlemagne and his ancestors'

00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:30.200
lands were, where their wealth
came from, where they lived,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.033
where their followers
came from--

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:37.167
was at what had been the borders
of the Roman Empire,

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:42.667
what's now northeastern
France, Belgium, the

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:46.633
Netherlands, west northwestern
Germany--

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:49.400
a territory known at this
time as Austrasia.

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:01.367
Charlemagne's ancestors were
great men, major nobles of the

00:02:01.367 --> 00:02:03.067
region of Austrasia--

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:08.200
again, eastern France, western
Germany, the Low Countries.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.667
They were nominal servants of
the Merovingian rulers and

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:21.267
rose to prominence with
a title of maior.

00:02:21.267 --> 00:02:24.800
And Wickham preserves just
the Latin, maior--

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.600
major, larger, great man.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.500
The maior of the palace--

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.167
"the mayor of the palace"
is how this is usually

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:34.333
translated.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.467
And of course, our word
mayor applies

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:39.067
to a municipal official.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:42.667
So mayor of the palace is
a rather funny title.

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:46.800
But it's really a kind of prime
minister or leader of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.967
the soldiers--

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:52.100
prime minister and defense
secretary or minister.

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:58.567
And this title tended
to be hereditary.

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:07.700
One of the problems of rulers
in Merovingian world, in the

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.767
Lombard world, in all of Western
Europe, is controlling

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:14.467
their mighty servants.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.367
Because these people were not
just easy to fire, you

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:26.600
couldn't just cut their
salaries or stop their

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.267
paycheck, because they're
not getting a paycheck.

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.367
They are the leaders
of soldiers.

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:33.867
They own castles,
fortifications.

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:36.200
But most of all,
they own land.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.100
And as landowners and as
established powers within the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.900
society, their power rivals--

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.600
and in the case of Charlemagne's
ancestors--

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.467
would exceed the power
of the king.

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:55.033
So these are not people who
are easy to dislodge.

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:59.167
And they are people who tend to
want their power to be not

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:01.900
appointive but hereditary--

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.567
in other words, to bequeath
titles like mayor of the

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:07.967
palace to their sons.

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:15.200
I mention this now because next
week we'll see this is a

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.300
problem that Charlemagne's
descendants would have. They

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.533
would have the same problem.

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:29.067
How do you make your officials
that you've appointed listen

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:33.133
to you, obey your orders, if
you don't have sufficient

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:35.233
coercive power to remove them?

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.900
And the reason you don't have
sufficient coercive power to

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.933
remove them, again, is because
they are military officials,

00:04:43.933 --> 00:04:47.733
they have their own followers,
they are well-established in

00:04:47.733 --> 00:04:51.167
various territories, and so
they're hard to tame.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:54.333
They are becoming little
kings themselves.

00:04:54.333 --> 00:04:57.300
And a key aspect of the ability
to become a local

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.467
ruler, even though officially
you're subject to the real

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:08.267
king of a large realm, is
because it's become

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:09.200
hereditary.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.500
It's become a family property.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.767
This tendency to
decentralization, inheritance,

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:25.267
and weakened royal power is
often called "feudalism," a

00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:29.867
word that you may as
well write down--

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:32.133
you've heard of it--

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:33.867
but which we're not
going to use.

00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:36.667
And we're not going to use it
for a couple of reasons, one

00:05:36.667 --> 00:05:42.867
of which is nobody uses
the term at the time.

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:46.067
It carries a lot of other
overtones that are not

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:49.733
relevant to us, and really
insofar as it has use, it

00:05:49.733 --> 00:05:55.600
describes a later period, a
History 211 kind of reality, a

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.300
post-year 1000 reality.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.200
But what is to be recalled is
that, once you no longer have

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.467
an official state apparatus
with an administrative

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:15.367
structure or bureaucracy like
Diocletian, like Constantine,

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:18.867
like Justinian, or even like
those Byzantine emperors we

00:06:18.867 --> 00:06:23.667
were talking about, or like
the Abbasid Caliphate--

00:06:23.667 --> 00:06:29.233
all of those are complex
structures of state

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:33.233
bureaucracies funded
by taxation.

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:37.500
Here we have something that is
not that sort of polity.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.900
It is more personal.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.100
It is more military.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.333
It depends more on plunder, on
expansion, on charisma, that

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:52.400
is, personal ability to get
people to obey you.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.600
It has a very rudimentary
structure.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.833
And the success of a state is
judged on the basis of its

00:07:01.833 --> 00:07:04.667
ability to survive, even if
the ruler doesn't have

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:10.500
charisma, even if the ruler's
not all that great.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.600
Because people obey the state,
they obey its officials, they

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.867
obey the idea of the state,
and not the individual

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:22.633
personality.

00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:26.300
So we're going to talk about
Charlemagne's ancestors and

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:32.267
how they got into power, how
they went from being mighty

00:07:32.267 --> 00:07:37.067
servants, but servants
nonetheless, to kings of

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:43.633
France and eventually,
in 800, emperors.

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:45.400
What happened to the
Merovingians?

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.500
Last time we checked, the
Merovingians were certainly

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:54.867
kicking people around Francia,
warring with each other,

00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:58.933
occasionally regretting it and
burning the tax rolls, but

00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:02.900
pretty quickly returning to the
old plunder, and killing

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:08.200
people, and having fun kind
of barbarian economy.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:15.400
The Merovingian dynasty lasts
to the mid-eighth century.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:21.633
But for its last hundred years,
roughly 650 to 750, its

00:08:21.633 --> 00:08:23.267
rulers are ineffective.

00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:29.567
They have the title "kings."
They have great prestige.

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:31.733
But they are weak.

00:08:31.733 --> 00:08:37.433
A lot of our understanding of
their position really is

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:42.000
simply a gloss, or an
elaboration, of a few lines of

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.767
Einhard, the biographer of
Charlemagne, whom you've read.

00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:49.400
"The family of the
Merovingians," he says on page

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.100
16 of this book, "From which the
Franks used to make their

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:58.167
kings, is thought to have lasted
down to King Childeric

00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:01.300
whom Pope Stephen
ordered deposed.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.167
His long hair was shorn, and
he was forced into a

00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.667
monastery." Remember, one of
the symbols of Merovingian

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:12.300
familial prestige was
this long hair.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.033
But Carolingians had short
hair and wore mustaches.

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:19.567
They kind of broke with
the Merovingian look.

00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:24.533
But of course, this is not just
a male fashion statement.

00:09:24.533 --> 00:09:27.067
"Although it might seem that the
Merovingian family ended

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:30.600
with him, it had in fact been
without any vitality for a

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.467
long time." The Merovingians
were just given a little

00:09:34.467 --> 00:09:37.733
shove, because they were already
basically finished.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:46.067
"There was nothing of any worth
in it, except for the

00:09:46.067 --> 00:09:48.167
empty name of king.

00:09:48.167 --> 00:09:50.833
For both the riches and power
of the kingdom were in

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:54.567
possession of the prefects of
the palace," this is how he's

00:09:54.567 --> 00:09:57.167
translating it, "who were
called the mayors of the

00:09:57.167 --> 00:10:00.800
palace, and to them fell
the highest command.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.867
Nothing was left for the king
to do except to sit on his

00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:07.900
throne with his hair long and
his beard uncut, satisfied to

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.733
hold the name of king only
and pretending to rule.

00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:16.167
Except for the empty name of
king and a meager living

00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:18.867
allowance, which the prefect of
the court extended to him,

00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:21.800
he possessed nothing else of his
own but one estate and a

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.933
very small income."

00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:27.967
Now, so much depends on these
words of Einhard, who then

00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:30.833
goes on to describe them going
around in these ceremonial

00:10:30.833 --> 00:10:33.267
carts, people acclaiming them.

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:35.800
But everybody knows that if they
want anything done, the

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.933
person to talk to is the
mayor of the palace.

00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:43.367
It's to Einhard's interest, or
at least to the interests of

00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:46.433
the Carolingians for whom he's
writing, to make it appear as

00:10:46.433 --> 00:10:49.267
if the Merovingians were
already finished.

00:10:49.267 --> 00:10:52.900
But nevertheless, it's clear
that they were much weaker

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.400
than the people we've
been reading about

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400
in Gregory of Tours.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.067
What happened to them?

00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:03.033
Well, one possibility that
Einhard, in effect, sort of

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:07.367
encourages is that something
happened to the family.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:14.167
They were weak personalities;
maybe they had some hereditary

00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:15.400
degeneration.

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:21.933
Or, they ran out of money.

00:11:21.933 --> 00:11:24.867
They did not have
lands to reward

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:26.200
their followers anymore.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:32.133
Remember that in this economy,
this is not something in which

00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:35.567
tax revenues are funding
the state.

00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:40.100
Up to a point they are, because
we saw that Fredegund

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.933
and Childeric had
tax revenues--

00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:46.700
at least, tax records--
to burn.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.400
But as the inheritance
of Rome--

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.100
Roman administration, Roman
literacy, Roman organization--

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:59.500
frayed, as that inheritance
became further and further

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:04.100
degraded, the ability to
tax the population--

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.900
rural, dispersed--

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.333
dwindled.

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:13.200
So it's not only a question of
the administrative decline but

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.600
of the economic decline, or
at least the economic

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.200
decentralization of the
way people lived.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.733
The Merovingians had depended an
awful lot on war and on the

00:12:23.733 --> 00:12:25.933
plunder received from war.

00:12:25.933 --> 00:12:31.267
You'll remember that when we
were talking about Clotar, the

00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:36.233
son of Clovis, that his men
rebelled when he didn't want

00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:38.033
to fight the Saxons.

00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:42.733
That's not just because they're
warlike savages, or

00:12:42.733 --> 00:12:45.367
insofar as they're warlike
savages, they're also in it

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:48.500
for treasure, plunder.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:54.467
Beowulf is a plunder-driven
world.

00:12:54.467 --> 00:12:57.333
The author of Beowulf is
well aware that this is

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:58.633
stupid, in a way.

00:12:58.633 --> 00:12:58.933
Right?

00:12:58.933 --> 00:13:01.467
The dragon has all
this plunder.

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:03.367
And what does he do with it?

00:13:03.367 --> 00:13:07.267
Dragons are not consumers.

00:13:07.267 --> 00:13:15.267
He lies on beds of gold coins
and beautiful armor and all

00:13:15.267 --> 00:13:16.667
sorts of things that
have been seized.

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:19.267
He has absolutely no use
for all of this stuff.

00:13:19.267 --> 00:13:22.533
And yet, stealing just a little
tiny ring or a little

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:24.433
bit of it enrages him.

00:13:24.433 --> 00:13:26.000
And so he starts his
depredations

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.033
out of anger at that.

00:13:29.033 --> 00:13:33.267
The Merovingians, once they stop
expanding, don't have the

00:13:33.267 --> 00:13:39.167
opportunities to keep their
economy going, their source of

00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:40.133
income going.

00:13:40.133 --> 00:13:43.700
And in particular, they lose the
ability, so it would seem,

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.867
to reward their followers.

00:13:45.867 --> 00:13:48.900
Their followers, their knights,
to call them that

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:55.233
anachronistically, their
military entourage does not

00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:58.600
flourish by being paid because
there's very little in the way

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.567
of coinage.

00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:02.467
There is very little in
the way of revenues.

00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:10.000
They benefit from things like
land, but as you are running

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
out of plunder and giving away
land, then sooner or later

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.133
you, yourself, the giver
of land, will not

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:17.667
have anymore to give.

00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:25.000
That's another hypothesis about
Merovingian decline.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:33.567
In fact, there is an effort by
a mayor of the palace of the

00:14:33.567 --> 00:14:36.967
late seventh century to depose
the Merovingian king--

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:49.933
a man named Grimoald, who is
an ancestor of Charlemagne.

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:51.567
But this is unsuccessful.

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:57.333
He tries to depose a
Merovingian ruler.

00:14:57.333 --> 00:15:00.167
And even though the Merovingians
are weak, their

00:15:00.167 --> 00:15:02.967
other followers prevent Grimoald
from succeeding.

00:15:02.967 --> 00:15:05.167
And indeed, he's executed.

00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:09.067
The prestige of the Merovingians
was such that

00:15:09.067 --> 00:15:11.833
even if they were not effective,
they were still the

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:15.667
kings because the blood of
Clovis flowed in their veins.

00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:19.467
And this was symbolized
by their familial

00:15:19.467 --> 00:15:22.233
distinctiveness, which included
the long hair, the

00:15:22.233 --> 00:15:24.800
uncut beard, the traveling
around in carts.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.667
This is important because it
means that you could not

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:37.567
succeed by direct action against
the Merovingians, at

00:15:37.567 --> 00:15:41.467
least not in 661, when
Grimoald was killed.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.967
In order to make this happen--

00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:52.500
in other words, even though he
was killed, his successors

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.200
remained as mayors
of the palace.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:01.133
They were tightly enough
ensconced or inserted into the

00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:04.333
structures of power and
successful enough as a family

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:05.800
that they were able
to survive, but as

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.533
mayors of the palace.

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:10.300
Looked at from the long term--
that is from the perspective

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:16.300
of 751, the year when Pippin
declared himself King of the

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.533
Franks and deposed that last
Merovingian ruler--

00:16:19.533 --> 00:16:23.200
looked at from that perspective,
the strategy of

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:28.000
the dynasty which we can call
Carolingians, even though

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.567
we're not yet at Charlemagne,
the strategy of the

00:16:31.567 --> 00:16:40.767
Carolingians was to come up with
another rationale for why

00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:44.700
they should be kings and not the
Merovingians, what we can

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.933
call "legitimacy".

00:16:46.933 --> 00:16:51.067
Legitimacy in politics is the
sense that the people who are

00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:55.233
ruling are ruling for good
reason, that their rule is

00:16:55.233 --> 00:16:57.000
legitimate.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.300
This can be on the basis of an
election: "I may not like the

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.633
president, but he was elected in
a fair election, therefore

00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:10.133
I accept the fact that he's
president." It may be triumph

00:17:10.133 --> 00:17:15.600
in war: "This emperor came
to power, deposed his

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:19.700
predecessor, and got the
Bulgars off our back,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.467
therefore his rule is
legitimate." It may be

00:17:23.467 --> 00:17:31.200
economic benefit: "This guy
has made my life easier

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.867
economically or I have the
feeling that things are going

00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:42.033
right." It may be dynasty: "This
is the oldest son of the

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:51.067
former king." The British rulers
just changed to end

00:17:51.067 --> 00:17:53.000
discrimination between men and
women in the succession.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.567
Obviously, Britain has a queen
rather than a king and has for

00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:11.433
the last sixty years, but the
favored candidate would be a

00:18:11.433 --> 00:18:12.733
male child.

00:18:12.733 --> 00:18:15.367
The circumstances of Elizabeth's
succession don't

00:18:15.367 --> 00:18:21.767
need to detain us, but she was
not the logical eldest--

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:25.867
obviously not the eldest
male child.

00:18:25.867 --> 00:18:27.733
So there are all sorts
of ways of having

00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:29.367
legitimacy as a ruler.

00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:35.833
The challenge for the mayors
of the palace was to create

00:18:35.833 --> 00:18:38.633
this legitimacy.

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:43.633
And they did it by several
different means.

00:18:43.633 --> 00:18:46.800
It's not that there's this
project where they set out in

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.300
year 662 and say, "Within ninety
years we're coming to

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.400
power, and here's how we're
going to do it." It is

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.433
historians who impose that
rational strategy.

00:18:56.433 --> 00:19:00.100
But nevertheless, it
is discernible.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.633
In fact, they are mayors of
the palace of several

00:19:03.633 --> 00:19:05.500
different pieces, because
the Merovingian

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.967
realm was not unified.

00:19:06.967 --> 00:19:08.867
It was in particular pieces.

00:19:08.867 --> 00:19:13.767
So these guys are the mayors
of the palace of Austrasia.

00:19:13.767 --> 00:19:21.400
So their opponents include the
other kingdoms, particularly

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.667
Neustria which is more or less
the region of Paris, the

00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:32.233
Seine, the central to northern
part of modern France, but

00:19:32.233 --> 00:19:36.567
further west than Austrasia;
So Austrasia is northeast.

00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:39.567
Neustria is more central
and slightly south.

00:19:42.567 --> 00:19:44.200
So there are lots of rivals.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.467
It's a very dangerous
situation.

00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:47.700
It's a very violent world.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.733
But this is their plan.

00:19:49.733 --> 00:19:55.333
A lot of what they, that is
the Carolingians, the

00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:59.633
ancestors of Charlemagne,
accomplished was military.

00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:03.867
This is the bottom line of
leadership in the period we're

00:20:03.867 --> 00:20:05.233
dealing with.

00:20:05.233 --> 00:20:10.367
Without military prestige and
military success, it's very

00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:15.667
hard to craft a polity, let
alone hand it down to your

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:16.933
descendants.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:22.967
What is more unusual than
military leadership, however,

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:26.833
is that the Carolingians allied

00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:31.867
themselves to the Church.

00:20:31.867 --> 00:20:36.133
Their legitimacy as rulers would
be based very much on an

00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:38.967
alliance with the
Church, and in

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:42.533
particular, with the papacy.

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:45.067
The Bishop of Rome is someone
whom we haven't

00:20:45.067 --> 00:20:48.333
talked about very much.

00:20:48.333 --> 00:20:52.933
We mentioned Leo I back in the
fifth century, who was

00:20:52.933 --> 00:20:56.867
responsible for negotiating with
the Huns in the absence

00:20:56.867 --> 00:21:03.567
of the emperor and who also
upheld doctrinal orthodoxy

00:21:03.567 --> 00:21:05.967
against Monophysitism.

00:21:05.967 --> 00:21:08.933
But the pope was not inevitably
the sole ruler of

00:21:08.933 --> 00:21:11.767
the Church in the way he would
become in the modern world

00:21:11.767 --> 00:21:14.867
within the Catholic Church.

00:21:14.867 --> 00:21:20.233
The pope was the
Bishop of Rome.

00:21:20.233 --> 00:21:23.500
He was the guardian of some
of the chief relics of the

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:26.833
Christian world, the relics of
Saint Peter and Saint Paul,

00:21:26.833 --> 00:21:28.067
the apostles.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.467
He was the inheritor of the aura
of the city of Rome, the

00:21:34.467 --> 00:21:35.967
imperial city.

00:21:35.967 --> 00:21:39.000
He even had appropriated some
titles from the Roman

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.300
emperors, such as Pontifex
Maximus, an old pagan title.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.400
So the pope is the inheritor
of a lot of Roman imperial

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.867
prestige, but he is a
beleaguered inheritor of that.

00:21:50.867 --> 00:21:54.467
In fact, the pope's life
in Rome was dangerous.

00:21:54.467 --> 00:22:01.867
He was often eclipsed by or
threatened by the Lombards.

00:22:01.867 --> 00:22:05.300
The Lombards, a barbarian tribe
who had invaded Italy--

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.233
we talked about them
last time.

00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:10.433
They invaded in 568.

00:22:10.433 --> 00:22:15.167
They took most of Italy from
Justinian's heirs.

00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.200
They were Arian for
a longer time than

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.500
other barbarian tribes.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.067
And even when they ceased to be
Arian, they were eager to

00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:23.000
seize Rome.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.100
They weren't overwhelmingly
eager to seize Rome because

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.767
they never did it, but they
threatened the pope.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.867
During the seventh century, the
pope considered himself

00:22:35.867 --> 00:22:39.300
the ally of the Byzantine
Empire.

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.933
The emperors continued to
intervene, to debate various

00:22:43.933 --> 00:22:45.167
doctrinal things.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.433
But as the Lombard threat
grew, as the Byzantine

00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:58.400
emperors were iconoclast, the
pope cast around for a new

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:06.467
protector, beginning in
really the 720s, 730s.

00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:12.167
And so the alliance between
Carolingians and popes is

00:23:12.167 --> 00:23:15.633
natural, in the sense that they
both want something out

00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:17.067
of the other.

00:23:17.067 --> 00:23:20.467
The Carolingians, the mayors
of the palace, want

00:23:20.467 --> 00:23:21.800
legitimacy.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.333
They want to be sacred figures
within the Christian world, to

00:23:26.333 --> 00:23:31.300
trump the pre-Christian aura
of the Merovingians.

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.467
And the pope, out of the
Carolingians, wants protection

00:23:34.467 --> 00:23:40.633
from the Lombards and a sense
of rule over most of Europe

00:23:40.633 --> 00:23:42.833
that will favor the Church
and allow the Church

00:23:42.833 --> 00:23:45.500
to advance its work.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:51.767
The means of cementing this
alliance, however, are

00:23:51.767 --> 00:23:54.733
interestingly enough monks.

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:58.367
The people who are the shock
troops of the Christianization

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:03.967
of Europe, the expansion of
Europe, of the Church, and the

00:24:03.967 --> 00:24:08.933
furtherance of its mission are
monks, many of them from

00:24:08.933 --> 00:24:12.567
Ireland and Britain, who would
try to convert the

00:24:12.567 --> 00:24:16.233
countryside, either those places
that were minimally

00:24:16.233 --> 00:24:20.167
Christian or, beginning in the
late seventh and early eighth

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:26.433
centuries, extend Christianity
to places like Holland or

00:24:26.433 --> 00:24:32.933
central Germany that were not
parts of the Roman Empire and

00:24:32.933 --> 00:24:34.167
had never been Christian.

00:24:37.267 --> 00:24:40.667
So these monastic settlements
not only converted the

00:24:40.667 --> 00:24:46.300
countryside, but they served
as foci for economic and

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.133
social development.

00:24:49.133 --> 00:24:52.400
There was an alliance between
the mayors of the palace and

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.400
monks such as the English monk,
Saint Boniface, Apostle

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.667
to the Germans.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.367
Saint Boniface, in the eighth
century, would convert a lot

00:25:05.367 --> 00:25:09.600
of the Germans in and
east of the Rhine.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:14.267
He would receive support from
the mayors of the palace of

00:25:14.267 --> 00:25:18.200
Austrasia, because this is east
of where they are, and

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.933
they're interested in expanding
and settling there.

00:25:20.933 --> 00:25:25.367
And he received support from the
pope who is interested in

00:25:25.367 --> 00:25:28.500
the conversion of Christians.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.367
And so it's through
intermediaries like Saint

00:25:32.367 --> 00:25:37.433
Boniface and other monks that
the countryside gets converted

00:25:37.433 --> 00:25:42.700
and that the Carolingians and
the pope approach each other.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.800
Why monks?

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.767
Who are these guys?

00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:49.533
When we looked at the
Benedictine world, it seemed

00:25:49.533 --> 00:25:51.800
as if monks were supposed
to be enclosed in their

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.067
monasteries and not
wander around?

00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:56.400
These are somewhat
special monks.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.800
These are wandering monks.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.100
The Irish tradition was
different from the Benedictine

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.067
tradition and encouraged
wandering

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:07.033
as a form of penance.

00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:11.133
If you wanted to do penance or
to experience the power of God

00:26:11.133 --> 00:26:14.267
and randomness in the world,
which would you rather do--

00:26:14.267 --> 00:26:18.867
pray seven times a day in the
same place for decades, or

00:26:18.867 --> 00:26:23.667
just kind of like wander around,
try to convert people,

00:26:23.667 --> 00:26:25.733
and see if you could
get martyred?

00:26:25.733 --> 00:26:28.033
Certainly, the latter
is dangerous.

00:26:28.033 --> 00:26:30.533
The latter is truly dangerous.

00:26:30.533 --> 00:26:33.400
But these are very enterprising
guys.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.800
We just have this idea.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.333
Oh yeah, monks pray or they
copy manuscripts or they

00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:39.433
wander around and convert
people-- all of which are

00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:41.067
insanely difficult
things to do.

00:26:41.067 --> 00:26:43.033
You really have to admire
these guys.

00:26:45.833 --> 00:26:49.400
So many of them are from
Ireland, or from

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.600
recently-converted Anglo-Saxon
England.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.467
Anglo-Saxon England combines a
Benedictine structure with

00:26:55.467 --> 00:27:01.200
some of this inheritance
of Irish wandering.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.200
But it is these monasteries
that are founded in the

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.533
countryside of Germany, of the
Netherlands, and the alliances

00:27:11.533 --> 00:27:15.100
between the mayors of the palace
and the papacy that are

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:21.400
key in creating the Carolingian
dynasty.

00:27:25.533 --> 00:27:31.100
The mayors of the palace of
Austrasia come to preeminence

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.567
in the Merovingian realms in
the early eighth century.

00:27:34.567 --> 00:27:38.233
One of the key events here is
one that we've looked at from

00:27:38.233 --> 00:27:41.200
several sides now and
that will be, I

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.633
hope, familiar to you.

00:27:42.633 --> 00:27:48.733
And that is the Battle of
Poitiers in 733, also known as

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:50.000
the Battle of Tours.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.800
This is the battle in which
the Arabs were defeated in

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.367
northern France, and eventually
retreated to Spain.

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:09.567
733 marks the high water point
of Arab incursions into Europe

00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:14.500
and is, in a sense, a parallel
to 717, the defeat of the

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.767
Siege of Constantinople.

00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:24.933
The victor at Poitiers was the
mayor of the palace of

00:28:24.933 --> 00:28:30.567
Austrasia, a man named Charles
Martel, "the Hammer." He

00:28:30.567 --> 00:28:31.933
doesn't have a last name.

00:28:31.933 --> 00:28:34.633
It's sort of a
[clarification: a sobriquet]--

00:28:34.633 --> 00:28:35.867
Charles Martel.

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.533
And he gained tremendous
prestige from this.

00:28:40.533 --> 00:28:45.800
That legitimation that we said
comes from military leadership

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:48.000
certainly was his.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.667
The Merovingian king
was nowhere to be

00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:50.833
seen at that battle.

00:28:50.833 --> 00:28:55.200
It was led by the mayor
of the palace.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:02.767
Charles' son, Pepin the Short,
started really to put together

00:29:02.767 --> 00:29:06.733
these aspects of rule.

00:29:06.733 --> 00:29:13.067
Pepin the Short, 741 to 768.

00:29:13.067 --> 00:29:16.600
Now there's something going on
here that I don't have an

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.867
explanation for.

00:29:21.567 --> 00:29:23.167
If he really was short--

00:29:23.167 --> 00:29:27.667
yet we know from digging up his
body that Charlemagne was

00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:30.700
on the order of 6' 7".

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:37.100
Charlemagne is really tall
for pre-modern people.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.300
He's really, really tall.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.800
And Einhard describes
him as tall.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.700
Einhard says his voice was
kind of squeaky and high,

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.867
given just how huge he was.

00:29:46.867 --> 00:29:48.967
I don't know how that works.

00:29:48.967 --> 00:29:51.800
Many of you are more advanced
in science and

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.633
genetics than me.

00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:56.567
But my pet theory, since Pepin's
body hasn't been

00:29:56.567 --> 00:29:59.933
found, is that actually he was
really tall too and that he's

00:29:59.933 --> 00:30:03.300
called Pepin the Short as a kind
of joke; you know like

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:10.633
guys nicknamed Tiny are
often 350 pounders.

00:30:10.633 --> 00:30:11.900
I'm just saying.

00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:17.133
Pepin the Short is the person
who crystallizes this

00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:20.500
potential alliance among papacy,
missionaries, and

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.867
mayors of the palace.

00:30:21.867 --> 00:30:25.200
And in doing so, he
transforms Europe.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.367
He favored the Church.

00:30:27.367 --> 00:30:33.667
He could mobilize his new power
and legitimacy through

00:30:33.667 --> 00:30:35.633
this alliance with the Church.

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:39.867
He encouraged various kinds of
monastic reforms urged by

00:30:39.867 --> 00:30:44.000
Saint Boniface, which meant
better discipline over

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:51.900
priests, more councils of
bishops, the restoration of

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:56.933
lands to the Church, and a
role for the king as the

00:30:56.933 --> 00:30:58.433
guardian and protector
of the Church.

00:31:03.633 --> 00:31:10.500
It may be at Boniface's
instigation that Pepin wrote

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.967
to the pope, Zacharias at this
time, asking, "Is it right for

00:31:15.967 --> 00:31:20.167
the man who holds the power not
to wear the crown, while

00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:26.800
the person who wears the crown
does not hold the power?" He

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:29.767
asks this as if it were a
hypothetical question.

00:31:29.767 --> 00:31:31.833
"Oh, you know, we were just
discussing this last night and

00:31:31.833 --> 00:31:35.467
wondered what you think." But
of course, the pope is quite

00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:39.167
aware of what's at stake and
says it is wrong for the

00:31:39.167 --> 00:31:44.500
person who holds the power not
to hold the crown; whereupon

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:52.300
in 751, Pepin had himself
elected king of the Franks,

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:59.033
deposed and put in a monastery
the last Merovingian king, and

00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:01.567
by his being put in the
monastery, he was tonsured,

00:32:01.567 --> 00:32:05.733
that is to say much of
his hair was cut off,

00:32:05.733 --> 00:32:06.967
desacrilizing him.

00:32:09.267 --> 00:32:14.300
And unlike Grimoald's failed
coup d'etat, this was totally,

00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:18.667
peacefully, no problem,
greeted by everybody,

00:32:18.667 --> 00:32:21.100
successful.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:25.667
In 753, two years later, the
new pope, Stephen, made an

00:32:25.667 --> 00:32:26.867
unprecedented--

00:32:26.867 --> 00:32:28.400
literally unprecedented--

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.933
journey across the Alps.

00:32:29.933 --> 00:32:32.267
No pope had ever been
in northern

00:32:32.267 --> 00:32:34.467
Europe until this year.

00:32:34.467 --> 00:32:36.733
And he crowned Pepin.

00:32:40.567 --> 00:32:45.900
He was desperate over the
situation with the Lombards.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:51.267
And in return, Pepin led an
expedition that, although not

00:32:51.267 --> 00:32:55.133
the definitive invasion of Italy
that Charlemagne would

00:32:55.133 --> 00:32:58.600
undertake, at least gave the
pope some breathing room and

00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.867
defeated the Lombards.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.367
At Pepin's death in 768, he
was succeeded by his son,

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:12.667
Charles, and his other
son Carloman.

00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:13.967
Charles--

00:33:13.967 --> 00:33:15.900
the future Charles the
Great, Charlemagne.

00:33:19.567 --> 00:33:25.967
Carloman died in 771, maybe
naturally, maybe not, leaving

00:33:25.967 --> 00:33:29.067
Charlemagne as the sole ruler.

00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:32.967
Charlemagne at this point is
king of the Franks, inheritor

00:33:32.967 --> 00:33:37.733
of the title and accomplishments
of his father.

00:33:37.733 --> 00:33:43.933
He was the beneficiary, then,
of well over a hundred years

00:33:43.933 --> 00:33:47.300
of Carolingian ascent.

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.467
And let's just review the
factors that had aided his

00:33:51.467 --> 00:33:53.267
predecessors--

00:33:53.267 --> 00:33:58.133
the weakness of the
Merovingians; their position

00:33:58.133 --> 00:34:03.067
as mayors of the palace;
the activity of monks,

00:34:03.067 --> 00:34:08.400
missionaries, to Germany and
the eastern part of the

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:14.067
Frankish world; Byzantine
weakness and the Lombard

00:34:14.067 --> 00:34:23.233
threat; and, of course,
Byzantine flirting with

00:34:23.233 --> 00:34:25.100
heresies like Iconoclasm.

00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:31.233
The result is then a kind of
geopolitical shift of the

00:34:31.233 --> 00:34:34.167
papacy towards the North.

00:34:34.167 --> 00:34:38.100
Another chapter in that long
book of the end of

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.333
Mediterranean hegemony.

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:42.933
Instead of looking to the
eastern Mediterranean for

00:34:42.933 --> 00:34:46.900
protection and for the ruler who
was his natural ally, the

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:54.033
pope now looks to a northern
transalpine ruler.

00:34:54.033 --> 00:34:56.900
Charlemagne you've read about.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.533
And you've read Einhard's
biography of him.

00:35:00.533 --> 00:35:06.133
It is, in some sense, at least a
seemingly artless biography.

00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:08.967
He obviously likes him, admires
him, but he describes

00:35:08.967 --> 00:35:11.133
him as a real person.

00:35:11.133 --> 00:35:16.300
We learn that he liked baths and
roast meat, that he had a

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:20.600
high voice, that he loved having
his daughters around

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.600
him but probably kind of
mistreated them by not

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.767
allowing them to marry.

00:35:23.767 --> 00:35:25.867
And then Einhard is scandalized
that since they

00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:31.867
couldn't marry, they had all
sorts of guys hanging around.

00:35:31.867 --> 00:35:34.300
We get a sense of Charlemagne's
personality.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.367
Charlemagne is a man very much
at home in his time.

00:35:39.367 --> 00:35:43.867
He is comfortable with
being a warrior.

00:35:43.867 --> 00:35:48.200
He would lead campaigns year
after year after year.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:53.033
At the same time, he is a person
of learning, or at

00:35:53.033 --> 00:35:58.000
least a person who believes
learning is important.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.200
Einhard tells us that he never
quite really learned to read

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.900
and write, that he tried, that
he slept with Augustine's City

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:11.333
of God by his side, which is an
impressive thing to do as

00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:12.600
bedtime reading.

00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:18.033
And we also know that
he is pious.

00:36:18.033 --> 00:36:23.433
His piety does not interfere
with his enjoyment of life or

00:36:23.433 --> 00:36:28.967
with his harsh prosecution
of military campaigns.

00:36:28.967 --> 00:36:30.200
He's not a sensitive person.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:39.333
He's not a self-examining
kind of character.

00:36:39.333 --> 00:36:45.333
But very important is that his
notion of leadership combines

00:36:45.333 --> 00:36:48.333
what might be thought three
available forms of legitimacy

00:36:48.333 --> 00:36:50.700
of this era.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:57.000
One, and the most important,
is military prestige and

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.967
power, war leadership.

00:37:03.733 --> 00:37:08.267
And he conquered lots
of peoples.

00:37:08.267 --> 00:37:10.833
It was not just a
question of war

00:37:10.833 --> 00:37:11.933
leadership with no results.

00:37:11.933 --> 00:37:13.967
He had tremendous results.

00:37:13.967 --> 00:37:19.500
He conquered the Lombards
in Italy in 774.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.767
He conquered the Avars
in the 790s.

00:37:23.767 --> 00:37:26.933
So much treasure did he seize
from them-- remember we saw

00:37:26.933 --> 00:37:29.433
the Avars as besiegers
of Constantinople?

00:37:29.433 --> 00:37:33.067
By this time, they're in
more-or-less modern Hungary.

00:37:33.067 --> 00:37:35.833
He seized so much treasure that
the entire economy of his

00:37:35.833 --> 00:37:40.967
empire basically was financed
on the basis of this plunder

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:46.800
until his death in 814, so
for nearly twenty years.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.833
He conquered the Bavarians.

00:37:49.833 --> 00:37:53.333
He conquered the Saxons in
northern, eastern Germany, a

00:37:53.333 --> 00:37:59.533
very, very difficult series of
campaigns from 774 to 806 that

00:37:59.533 --> 00:38:07.133
involved large numbers of
civilian casualties, virtual

00:38:07.133 --> 00:38:10.700
exterminations of peoples,
and forced conversion.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:15.967
It was the first real, sustained
campaign of forced

00:38:15.967 --> 00:38:20.133
conversion to Christianity
in European history.

00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:23.700
Brutal, but successful,
opening up really the

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.767
definition of modern Germany.

00:38:25.767 --> 00:38:29.867
Much of what the modern German
state is, in its central and

00:38:29.867 --> 00:38:33.200
eastern parts, in the
north, is Saxon.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.433
There is a part called Saxony
still, a province of the

00:38:36.433 --> 00:38:37.633
former East Germany.

00:38:37.633 --> 00:38:42.300
But in fact, a province, or a
land as they're called, of the

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:46.400
former West Germany is called,
Nieder-Sachsen, Lower-Saxony.

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.300
So the Saxons are spread
throughout northern Germany.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.867
And by Charlemagne's death,
Germany or the eastern

00:38:53.867 --> 00:39:00.667
Frankish realm starts to look
like something familiar.

00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:04.633
He conquers a bit in Spain
against the Muslims. His

00:39:04.633 --> 00:39:09.300
forces would seize Barcelona
in the year 801.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.267
But he does not get as
far as he had hoped.

00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:16.233
In particular, he had hoped
to take Saragossa.

00:39:16.233 --> 00:39:21.167
His army was defeated by,
actually, Basques.

00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:25.533
But their defeat leads to the
literary triumph known as the

00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:28.267
Song of Roland, one of the great
works of the Middle Ages

00:39:28.267 --> 00:39:31.367
in which the enemy are Muslims.
And the Song of

00:39:31.367 --> 00:39:35.500
Roland is a great sort of
Crusade ideology text which

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.967
shows, in its own words,
that Christians are

00:39:37.967 --> 00:39:40.500
right, pagans are wrong.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.267
Of course, they call
the Muslims pagans.

00:39:43.267 --> 00:39:45.600
They depict them as worshipping
Apollo, and

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.100
Termagent, and other gods.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.500
They know that the Muslims
are not literally pagans.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.467
But it has higher rhetorical
value.

00:39:57.333 --> 00:39:58.933
Charlemagne is tremendously
successful as

00:39:58.933 --> 00:39:59.833
a war leader then.

00:39:59.833 --> 00:40:05.733
His second form of power
and legitimacy is

00:40:05.733 --> 00:40:07.333
as a Christian ruler.

00:40:09.833 --> 00:40:20.467
He is a man with a vision of a
Christian polity, of alliance

00:40:20.467 --> 00:40:27.100
with the Church, and as seeing
himself as responsible for the

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.400
spiritual health
of his people.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.000
This is important, this latter
responsibility, because it has

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.833
a lot to do with the program
of education that we'll be

00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:42.500
talking about next week, the
intellectual air of his court.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.767
He believes himself, therefore,
to be not just

00:40:44.767 --> 00:40:49.367
somebody who is supposed to
convert the Saxons forcibly,

00:40:49.367 --> 00:40:52.767
but is supposed to educate his
population into becoming

00:40:52.767 --> 00:40:57.100
Christians of a real sort.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:01.267
This also means that he is
allied with the pope and

00:41:01.267 --> 00:41:05.167
believes that the pope is
capable of aiding him in more

00:41:05.167 --> 00:41:09.167
than merely symbolic ways.

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:12.300
The third aspect of power
and legitimacy is

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.667
the legacy of Rome.

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:17.433
It is the thing that unifies
this entire course.

00:41:17.433 --> 00:41:22.433
Charlemagne, according to
Einhard, went to Rome to

00:41:22.433 --> 00:41:27.267
rescue the pope yet again, not
this time from the Lombards in

00:41:27.267 --> 00:41:30.933
800, but from the
Roman factions.

00:41:30.933 --> 00:41:38.967
Pope Leo III was rescued by
Charlemagne, put back in Rome.

00:41:38.967 --> 00:41:42.533
Charlemagne, Einhard tells us,
went to Saint Peter's on

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:46.167
Christmas Day to pray.

00:41:46.167 --> 00:41:49.100
And lo and behold, the pope
jumped out from behind a

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.833
pillar and put the crown on his
head and he was acclaimed

00:41:52.833 --> 00:41:54.667
Roman emperor.

00:41:54.667 --> 00:41:58.833
And Charlemagne said later,
he wouldn't have gone--

00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:00.833
even though it was Christmas--
he wouldn't have gone to

00:42:00.833 --> 00:42:04.067
church at all if he'd known
this was going to happen.

00:42:04.067 --> 00:42:09.200
We can be cynical about the
surprise aspect of this, or

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.933
about Charlemagne's
uncharacteristic modesty.

00:42:12.933 --> 00:42:17.000
Nevertheless, we have to think
about the implications of the

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.400
pope crowning the emperor.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.033
Constantine wasn't crowned
by a pope.

00:42:30.267 --> 00:42:33.833
The problem with having someone
crown you is that it

00:42:33.833 --> 00:42:37.233
could be implied that he is the
one who bestows the crown

00:42:37.233 --> 00:42:42.167
and could decide not to crown
someone in the future.

00:42:42.167 --> 00:42:44.233
It looks as if he's the
more powerful one.

00:42:44.233 --> 00:42:46.267
He's standing; he's putting
the crown on

00:42:46.267 --> 00:42:48.133
you; and you're kneeling.

00:42:48.133 --> 00:42:52.500
Indeed, as an evocation of this,
almost exactly 1,000

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:57.300
years later in 1804, when
Napoleon had himself crowned

00:42:57.300 --> 00:43:02.867
by the pope, Napoleon seized
the crown from the pope's

00:43:02.867 --> 00:43:07.100
hands and put in on himself, put
it on his own head, in a

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.033
direct reference
to Charlemagne.

00:43:11.033 --> 00:43:17.267
So Roman, Christian, and
military leadership.

00:43:17.267 --> 00:43:20.600
Of these, the Roman is the most
impressive and the most

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:24.333
sort of historically dramatic,
but probably the least

00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:26.667
significant at the time.

00:43:26.667 --> 00:43:29.967
Charlemagne did not consider his
empire to be exactly the

00:43:29.967 --> 00:43:32.233
same thing as the
Roman Empire.

00:43:32.233 --> 00:43:34.367
He would divide it.

00:43:34.367 --> 00:43:37.700
The fact that he handed it over
to one son is that he

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:42.400
only ended up having
one surviving son.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.833
But he had plans to divide it.

00:43:43.833 --> 00:43:46.400
It's not clear if he regarded
the imperial title as anything

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.833
that would really survive.

00:43:48.833 --> 00:43:53.167
Nevertheless, he was an emperor;
and an emperor

00:43:53.167 --> 00:43:56.667
meaning that he ruled
over many peoples.

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:59.533
He was more than just the king
of the Franks because he now

00:43:59.533 --> 00:44:03.333
ruled over Barbarians, Avars,
Visigoths, Lombards.

00:44:06.267 --> 00:44:11.667
He had made a good stab at
restoring the Roman Empire in

00:44:11.667 --> 00:44:17.733
the West. But it's a different
Roman Empire.

00:44:17.733 --> 00:44:24.467
Its base is not really in Rome
nor even in Milan or Ravenna,

00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:28.533
the late Roman imperial capitals
of the fifth century.

00:44:28.533 --> 00:44:40.400
It is in Aachen, a city in
Austrasia where remains of his

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:44.867
palace chapel still stand.

00:44:44.867 --> 00:44:53.000
His lands, influence, cronies,
family, political base,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.800
economic base, military
recruiting base, are all in

00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.400
northern Europe.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.733
Charlemagne is, then in some
sense, the reviver of the

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:03.667
Roman Empire.

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:09.133
But he is also the founder of
Europe as something not just a

00:45:09.133 --> 00:45:13.267
geographical expression but
a cultural expression.

00:45:13.267 --> 00:45:17.667
Whether it is a socio-political
expression,

00:45:17.667 --> 00:45:18.800
time will tell.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.233
When the European Union, the
Euro, and all these things

00:45:22.233 --> 00:45:25.000
that are sort of semi-unraveling
now were

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.367
cemented in their current form
in the early 1990s, the

00:45:30.367 --> 00:45:36.067
treaties that established that
were deliberately made in the

00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:40.333
territories that are neither
French nor German entirely,

00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:44.400
but are really part of the old
Carolingian patrimony.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.300
The treaties in places like
Maastricht, the location of

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:53.100
Brussels as the capitol of the
European Union, all of this is

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:57.067
really evocative of the
empire of Charlemagne.

00:45:57.067 --> 00:46:04.167
These are the lands of the
Carolingians and this is, in

00:46:04.167 --> 00:46:07.167
the next thousand years,
in certain respects

00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:10.800
the center of Europe.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.433
We'll talk more about the
Carolingians next week.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.736
Prof: Today I want to
talk about the Industrial

00:00:06.736 --> 00:00:10.170
Revolution from a variety of
aspects.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.905
Everything on the board I put
on our website,

00:00:12.905 --> 00:00:15.330
so don't worry about copying it
down.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.700
It's all pretty obvious.
 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.345
Doing the Industrial Revolution
across the century is no easy

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:26.830
task, but we will do it and do
the reading.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.652
Let me just say that the way
people look at what used to be

00:00:29.652 --> 00:00:32.534
called Industrial Revolution,
and I guess some people still

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:35.570
call it that,
has changed dramatically.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.840
Through the 1950s and into the
1960s,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.246
the idea of the Industrial
Revolution was that it was the

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:47.495
work of some genius inventors
who created machines used

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:51.035
primarily in the textile
industry--but also in

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:56.150
mining--that eliminated blocks
to assembly line production.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.979
Then everybody was crowded into
factories and the new brave

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.478
world opened up.
 

00:01:02.478 --> 00:01:04.863
In fact, one of the most
interesting books and great

00:01:04.863 --> 00:01:07.528
classics that is still in print
was written by an economic

00:01:07.528 --> 00:01:10.519
historian at Harvard who's still
around called David Landes.

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:13.221
It's a good book called The
Unbound Prometheus,

00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:14.599
which was basically that.
 

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:20.266
Some of the inventions that I
briefly describe in your

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:25.720
reading, the spinning jenny,
etc., refer to that.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.060
That kind of analysis led one
to concentrate on England,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.599
where the Industrial Revolution
began,

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:44.250
and to view industrialization
as being a situation of winners

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.840
and losers (by not going as
fast).

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.203
In your reading I give you some
pretty obvious examples of

00:01:54.203 --> 00:01:59.096
reasons for the Industrial
Revolution first coming to

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:02.859
England: the location of
resources,

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.135
particularly coal;
a country in which nowhere is

00:02:06.135 --> 00:02:09.520
more than seventy-five miles
away from the sea;

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.590
precocious canals and roads;
banking systems;

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.816
fluidity between classes and a
very large and increasingly

00:02:18.816 --> 00:02:24.930
larger proletariat;
agricultural revolution, etc.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.307
With that kind of analysis,
those places that didn't

00:02:28.307 --> 00:02:30.984
industrialize as fast,
for example,

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.466
France,
one thought they were

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:36.129
"retarded";
a word that was used,

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.470
unfortunately,
at that time.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.800
Then one tried to see why not.
 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.240
That analysis has been rejected
greatly over the past years,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.256
because the Industrial
Revolution is measured by more

00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:56.851
than simply large factories with
industrial workers and the

00:02:56.851 --> 00:02:59.068
number of machines.
 

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:01.419
This is the point of the
beginning of this.

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:03.919
The more that we look at the
Industrial Revolution,

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:08.393
the more we see that the
Industrial Revolution was first

00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:13.110
and foremost an intensification
of forms of production,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.919
of kinds of production that
were already there.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.746
Thus, we spend more time
looking at the intensification

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:25.710
of artisanal production,
craft production,

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.180
domestic industry--which we've
already mentioned,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.009
that is, people,
mostly women but also men and

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:41.490
children, too,
working in the countryside.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:47.247
The rapid rise of industrial
production was very much tied to

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:50.508
traditional forms of production.
 

00:03:50.508 --> 00:03:55.813
In Paris, for example,
in 1870, the average unit of

00:03:55.813 --> 00:04:02.180
production had only slightly
more than seven people in it.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.804
So, if you only look for big
factories and lots of machines,

00:04:06.804 --> 00:04:11.349
you'll be missing the boat on
the Industrial Revolution.

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.388
To be sure,
when we think of the Industrial

00:04:14.388 --> 00:04:15.919
Revolution we think of
Manchester,

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:20.031
which grew from a very small
town into this enormous city

00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:24.069
full of what Engels called
"the satanic mills"

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.199
of industrial production.
 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.685
Or you think of smoky
Sheffield, also in Northern

00:04:30.685 --> 00:04:31.620
England.
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.329
Or you think of Birmingham in
the midlands.

00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:38.009
If you think of France you'll
think of Lille and its two

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.490
burgeoning towns around it,
Tourcoing and Roubaix.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.720
Or you think of Saint Etienne,
which was kind of France's

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.470
Manchester.
 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.440
In Germany you think of the
Rhineland and the Ruhr.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.879
In Italy you think of Turin and
Milan.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.944
In Russia, you think of the
Moscow and St.

00:04:56.944 --> 00:04:58.440
Petersburg region.
 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.889
In Spain, Barcelona.
 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.675
Indeed, those are classic cases
of industrial concentration,

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:08.269
where you do have really
significant mechanization over a

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:10.129
very long period of time.
 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:15.420
You do have large towns with
smoky factories full of workers.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.720
But again, and we've
underestimated--in fact,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.730
the second edition has more
about this than the first,

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.170
which you're reading--the
degree of industrial production

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.470
in the late Russian empire.
 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.336
Yet, to be sure,
when I say that the Industrial

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:35.202
Revolution is first and foremost
an intensification of forms of

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:39.610
industries that already existed,
if you were a parachutist and

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.869
you're somehow floating down
over Europe from,

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:46.634
say, the middle of the
eighteenth century through the

00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:49.459
middle of the nineteenth
century,

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:51.939
what you would see is that
there were still all sorts of

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.531
industry,
a rapid increase of industrial

00:05:54.531 --> 00:05:57.540
production that is out in the
countryside,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.740
that's not in factories.
 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.120
It's done in a very traditional
way.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.680
Or rural handicrafts,
people producing all sorts of

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.319
things still at home.
 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:14.632
There's a marvelous book
written by a scholar called

00:06:14.632 --> 00:06:21.660
Maxine Berg, who teaches at
Warwick in England.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.910
The book is called The Age
of Manufacture.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.300
She reexamined the Industrial
Revolution and discovered that,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.439
for example,
the town of Birmingham,

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:33.430
which produced all sorts of
toys,

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.269
big toy manufacturers,
that even though you had a lot

00:06:36.269 --> 00:06:38.851
of factories,
you still had a lot of the toys

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:42.026
being finished or even produced
by women working in the

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:45.319
hinterland, that is,
the arrière pays,

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:49.779
or the environs of Birmingham.
 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:54.279
If you take smoky Sheffield,
a grim kind of place in the

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:58.288
nineteenth century,
where they produced knives and

00:06:58.288 --> 00:06:59.269
cutlery.
 

00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:02.447
You still had a lot of these
products being finished by

00:07:02.447 --> 00:07:04.329
people out in the countryside.
 

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:05.740
If you take the North of
France,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.790
if you think of a town like
Reims,

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:16.314
famous for champagne,
it was a big industrial center

00:07:16.314 --> 00:07:20.353
but it wasn't the center of
mechanized production until

00:07:20.353 --> 00:07:21.850
after about 1850.
 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:24.504
What you had is you had all
these people out in the

00:07:24.504 --> 00:07:27.264
countryside, mostly women,
who are doing spinning and

00:07:27.264 --> 00:07:29.759
weaving and carding and that
kind of thing.

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:34.589
Or around Nancy in the east of
France.

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:38.718
By 1875 you still had something
like 75,000 women who were

00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:41.759
embroiderers working in the
countryside.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.110
Rural industry intensifies.
 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.983
Finally, at the end--not at the
end, but it depends on where you

00:07:50.983 --> 00:07:56.019
are--you have this implosion of
work into factories.

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:59.435
So, by the end of the century
the kind of traditional view

00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:02.911
that one would have of the
Industrial Revolution has really

00:08:02.911 --> 00:08:05.278
arrived,
where factory production and

00:08:05.278 --> 00:08:07.180
above all,
in the textile industry.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.317
The textile industry is the
leading edge of the Industrial

00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:13.490
Revolution.
 

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:19.437
You have women who used to work
at home that are now working in

00:08:19.437 --> 00:08:24.810
factories as what the British
call textile operatives.

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.819
Or Switzerland,
you think of Switzerland as

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:32.192
being the famous mercenaries in
the early modern period or the

00:08:32.192 --> 00:08:35.058
very wealthy bankers in our own
day.

00:08:35.058 --> 00:08:39.168
But if you think of a town like
Zurich, on the lake,

00:08:39.168 --> 00:08:42.740
there was all sorts of industry
in the uplands of Zurich,

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.460
up into the hills and even into
the mountains around Zurich,

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.428
of handicraft production.
 

00:08:50.428 --> 00:08:53.109
Or Austria, in the
Austria-Hungarian empire,

00:08:53.109 --> 00:08:56.908
there's hundreds of thousands
of people working in the textile

00:08:56.908 --> 00:08:57.720
industry.
 

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.019
The details aren't as important
as the fact that,

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:04.570
to be sure, the mines that you
read about in Germinal,

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:09.703
which is a great, great read,
and the factories that I will

00:09:09.703 --> 00:09:12.702
describe in a while are
described by Engels--and I

00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:15.823
couldn't do better than
that--are a reality and they

00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:18.149
become the industrial
experience.

00:09:18.149 --> 00:09:20.796
When you think of Detroit,
Michigan, in the 1930s,

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:22.740
or Flint, Michigan,
in the 1930s,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.879
or you think about now the rust
belt of Connecticut of

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:31.567
Torrington and these places that
were once booming industrial

00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:32.350
towns.
 

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:35.139
That's the kind of classic
model.

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:39.259
The American model really is
closer to what people used to

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:43.740
think the Industrial Revolution
meant in the case of Europe.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.220
But that's not a subject for
now.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.051
A couple points--by the way,
I don't think I'll ever get to

00:09:50.051 --> 00:09:52.759
my notes, but it doesn't really
matter.

00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:55.509
First of all,
and this is another reason why

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:58.450
the Industrial Revolution starts
in England.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:02.408
You can't have an industrial
revolution without an

00:10:02.408 --> 00:10:04.509
agricultural revolution.
 

00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:08.441
What the Agricultural
Revolution does is increases the

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:12.817
amount of food produced that's
going to feed your burgeoning

00:10:12.817 --> 00:10:15.340
proletariat, your labor force.
 

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.034
This is a place,
all of Europe increases in

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:18.870
population.
 

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:23.054
The French population is unique;
it stops growing in 1846 and

00:10:23.054 --> 00:10:23.639
1847.
 

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:26.028
In simply stops,
skids to a halt.

00:10:26.028 --> 00:10:28.019
But everywhere else,
the population grows.

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:31.033
There are regional differences
in France, as there are regional

00:10:31.033 --> 00:10:32.250
differences everywhere.
 

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.830
But the Industrial Revolution
depends on the Agricultural

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.428
Revolution for an increase in
food supply.

00:10:40.428 --> 00:10:46.313
This makes possible the
increase in urban population,

00:10:46.313 --> 00:10:51.178
thus also increasing the demand
for food.

00:10:51.178 --> 00:10:54.774
Also, the Agricultural
Revolution particularly,

00:10:54.774 --> 00:10:58.916
but not just in the case of
England, increases capital

00:10:58.916 --> 00:11:00.009
formation.
 

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:05.009
You've got this sort of surplus
of money, bucks,

00:11:05.009 --> 00:11:10.115
pounds, fric,
cash that can be invested in

00:11:10.115 --> 00:11:11.500
industry.
 

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.139
This is precisely what happens.
 

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:17.807
That's why the Agricultural
Revolution is absolutely

00:11:17.807 --> 00:11:18.668
important.
 

00:11:18.668 --> 00:11:21.264
These three things,
Industrial Revolution,

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:24.365
Agricultural Revolution,
and the growth of cities,

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:26.389
are very much tied together.
 

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:29.688
Let me give you an example,
which you certainly don't have

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:30.500
to remember.
 

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.658
Think of Manchester.
 

00:11:32.658 --> 00:11:36.932
I describe the statistics in
there, that the growth of

00:11:36.932 --> 00:11:40.320
Manchester is a prodigious,
scary thing.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.418
I'll talk more about how rural
and urban elites are frightened

00:11:43.418 --> 00:11:45.970
by the growth of cities,
particularly in Germany,

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.788
but in France, England,
and in the United States, later.

00:11:49.788 --> 00:11:52.929
What the growth of Manchester
does is it really changes the

00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:55.636
countryside around and helps
bring the Agricultural

00:11:55.636 --> 00:11:56.450
Revolution.
 

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.730
What do I mean by that?
 

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.445
You find the same thing around
Paris, around Berlin,

00:12:00.445 --> 00:12:02.947
or around Warsaw,
almost any big city that I can

00:12:02.947 --> 00:12:03.639
think of.
 

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:06.658
In response to this urban
growth,

00:12:06.658 --> 00:12:11.840
this big octopus of people and
money,

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.717
of rich people and poor people,
I'll talk about some of the

00:12:14.717 --> 00:12:16.408
rich people next time on
Wednesday.

00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:19.028
You've got an expanded demand
for food.

00:12:19.028 --> 00:12:23.211
In that ring immediately around
a city like Manchester,

00:12:23.211 --> 00:12:27.936
you've got a dramatic expansion
of people doing what they call

00:12:27.936 --> 00:12:29.330
truck farming.
 

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.990
They're specializing in crops
for the urban market--fruit,

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.070
vegetables, things like that.
 

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.288
They specialize because there
are people there that are going

00:12:41.288 --> 00:12:43.379
to pay for and eat what they
produce.

00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:47.705
Take the example of Paris,
which I'll come back and talk

00:12:47.705 --> 00:12:50.379
about with great relish someday.
 

00:12:50.379 --> 00:12:54.441
The suburbs of Paris,
a place called Montreuil,

00:12:54.441 --> 00:12:58.678
which is kind of a grim part of
eastern Paris.

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:00.844
It used to be famous for its
cherries, and fruits,

00:13:00.844 --> 00:13:03.229
and that kind of thing that
they were producing for the

00:13:03.229 --> 00:13:03.980
urban market.
 

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.575
Or wine, if you can imagine
wine being produced,

00:13:06.575 --> 00:13:09.168
what a horrible idea,
in the region of Paris.

00:13:09.168 --> 00:13:12.750
It's Asnières,
on the Seine.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.038
They used to produce wine for
Paris's vast market.

00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:19.082
Then the next big ring around
Manchester, you've got the big

00:13:19.082 --> 00:13:21.139
fish eating the little fish.
 

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:23.500
They are more productive.
 

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:28.405
As this commercial agriculture
develops and more productive

00:13:28.405 --> 00:13:31.960
production--that's a terrible
sentence,

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.672
there's a greater productivity
in response to this urban

00:13:35.672 --> 00:13:36.279
demand.
 

00:13:36.279 --> 00:13:40.113
On the far, distant places you
have people specializing in the

00:13:40.113 --> 00:13:43.317
production of cattle,
that is, milk and meat for the

00:13:43.317 --> 00:13:44.009
market.
 

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:46.437
Of course, the other thing
which goes without saying is

00:13:46.437 --> 00:13:48.865
that in the course of the
nineteenth century you've got

00:13:48.865 --> 00:13:50.710
this amazing development in
shipping.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:54.053
Pretty soon with steel,
and with refrigeration--and

00:13:54.053 --> 00:13:57.934
just like now you've got lamb
arriving from New Zealand and

00:13:57.934 --> 00:13:59.340
things like that.
 

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:04.870
This is largely in response to
the increase of these large

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:06.908
urban conurbations.
 

00:14:06.908 --> 00:14:11.285
We use the term
"conurbation"

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:18.542
to describe cities that grow up
so much that they actually merge

00:14:18.542 --> 00:14:20.038
together.
 

00:14:20.038 --> 00:14:24.000
The American Northeast became
sort of a conurbation.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.136
It's very hard when going to
New Jersey to ever see where

00:14:27.136 --> 00:14:28.370
there aren't cities.
 

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:30.870
One ends and then the other
starts.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:36.360
That becomes the case in parts
of Northern England as well.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.197
The term "protoindus
trialization"

00:14:40.197 --> 00:14:44.750
there is what we mean by the
expansion of industrial

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:48.678
production along very
traditional lines.

00:14:48.678 --> 00:14:51.096
What I put in parentheses
there, domestic or rural

00:14:51.096 --> 00:14:53.019
industry, we've already talked
about.

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:58.144
So, first you've got this
expansion of industry in the

00:14:58.144 --> 00:14:59.500
countryside.
 

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.769
I'll give you one example.
 

00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:03.557
Again, I hate to keep taking
examples occasionally from

00:15:03.557 --> 00:15:05.159
France, but I know that best.
 

00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:09.448
The city of Lyons,
which is a big soap producing

00:15:09.448 --> 00:15:11.910
city,
what you have in the first half

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.433
of the nineteenth century is
you've got an implosion of work

00:15:15.433 --> 00:15:17.826
into Lyons,
into this working class suburb

00:15:17.826 --> 00:15:20.070
called the Croix-Rousse--it
doesn't matter,

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.000
although it's a neat place.
 

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.210
It's a really neat place.
 

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.458
Then in the 1850s the people
that owned the silk begin to put

00:15:28.458 --> 00:15:31.080
work back out into the
countryside.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.048
Why would they do that?
 

00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:36.453
Because the women working there
or the men working there worked

00:15:36.453 --> 00:15:38.759
for less than people living in
the city.

00:15:38.759 --> 00:15:43.200
Again, if you're parachuting
down starting about 1750,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:48.394
you have to imagine hundreds of
thousands of little dots out in

00:15:48.394 --> 00:15:50.070
the countryside.
 

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.522
And even more of them as the
Industrial Revolution gets

00:15:53.522 --> 00:15:57.551
kicking along before you finally
have this implosion or movement

00:15:57.551 --> 00:15:59.149
in and around cities.
 

00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:01.200
More about that when I talk
about cities.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:05.326
I'll help explain why European
cities are so different than

00:16:05.326 --> 00:16:08.384
American cities,
with the poor living on the

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:11.158
outside and the rich living
within.

00:16:11.158 --> 00:16:17.690
Large-scale industrialization
has a lot to do with that.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:22.485
Having said all of that,
let me talk a little bit

00:16:22.485 --> 00:16:27.381
about--I'll never get to my
notes, but this is fun

00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:29.879
anyway--women's work.
 

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:34.450
Did the Industrial Revolution
change women's work?

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.812
There are continuities in
women's work which are extremely

00:16:37.812 --> 00:16:41.408
important,
and ultimately there will be

00:16:41.408 --> 00:16:47.573
changes as factory production
comes to dominate in many places

00:16:47.573 --> 00:16:50.000
in industrial Europe.
 

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.970
Yet, there are certain things
that don't change about women's

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.750
work and women's roles in the
household.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:03.110
Women remain the head of the
family economy.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:10.670
Women, whether they're married
or simply living with people

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:18.230
that they've been living with
for a short or long time,

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:19.957
run the family economy and it's
true whether they are in rural

00:17:19.957 --> 00:17:21.088
Switzerland in the uplands of
Zurich,

00:17:21.088 --> 00:17:30.470
working in the textile
industry,

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:39.479
or whether they are textile
operatives in Manchester or

00:17:39.479 --> 00:17:43.150
someplace like that.
 

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.457
The Industrial Revolution does
not change other aspects of

00:17:47.457 --> 00:17:52.067
women's work in that at least
well into the nineteenth century

00:17:52.067 --> 00:17:55.088
in most parts of industrial
Europe,

00:17:55.088 --> 00:17:58.160
women are still working in the
countryside but also major

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.670
employers of women don't change
at all with industrialization.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.090
The classic case hereto is
England, and that is domestic

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:03.348
service.
 

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:04.830
If you were going to take
England in, say,

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.805
1850,
the largest three categories of

00:18:07.805 --> 00:18:11.788
people doing anything are not in
this order,

00:18:11.788 --> 00:18:24.836
but just about all the same
number would be women working as

00:18:24.836 --> 00:18:27.490
domestics.
 

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:29.529
Some men worked as domestics,
too.

00:18:29.529 --> 00:18:34.009
Say, domestic service,
textile operatives,

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:38.142
and an important category that
I'm going to talk about later in

00:18:38.142 --> 00:18:41.941
my theme of "it's bitter
hard to write the history of

00:18:41.941 --> 00:18:45.339
remainders,"
rural agricultural laborers,

00:18:45.339 --> 00:18:47.068
rural proletarians.
 

00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:51.425
Another category of women's
work, again which one hesitates

00:18:51.425 --> 00:18:54.279
to evoke, is of course
prostitution.

00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:58.250
The Industrial Revolution
doesn't change that sad aspect

00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:59.548
of women's work.
 

00:18:59.548 --> 00:19:04.545
It increases with urban growth
the number of people working as

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:07.740
prostitutes in even very small
towns.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.061
The number of prostitutes in
Paris or London is simply

00:19:10.061 --> 00:19:10.720
incalculable.
 

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.278
The estimates in Paris go from
20,000 to 100,000.

00:19:17.278 --> 00:19:23.189
Lots of women who are married
become prostitutes pour faire

00:19:23.189 --> 00:19:28.032
sa fin de mois,
to pay off the bills at the end

00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:29.680
of the month.
 

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:34.642
This sad aspect of women's
work, people forced into

00:19:34.642 --> 00:19:39.306
prostitution by want,
doesn't really change with

00:19:39.306 --> 00:19:41.490
industrialization.
 

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:45.190
The numbers simply get bigger
and bigger.

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.838
Of course, one of the results
of this,

00:19:46.838 --> 00:19:47.930
this isn't the time to discuss
this,

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.362
but there's a sort of panic at
the end of the nineteenth

00:19:51.362 --> 00:19:55.420
century about syphilis and about
venereal disease and all that.

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.930
Also which ironically helps
further condemn ordinary people

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:04.220
in elite minds,
which is a coincidence,

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.548
since many of the patrons or
many of the clients of

00:20:07.548 --> 00:20:11.345
prostitutes were middle-class
males no matter what country

00:20:11.345 --> 00:20:13.009
you're talking about.
 

00:20:13.009 --> 00:20:20.068
More about women's work in a
while in the context of

00:20:20.068 --> 00:20:21.730
factories.
 

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.670
Here again, history has its
history, too.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.868
When I grew up,
to the extent I ever did,

00:20:28.868 --> 00:20:33.997
as a student when I was
thinking about doing a

00:20:33.997 --> 00:20:36.980
dissertation,
and becoming an historian,

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.220
and all that stuff,
what people studied was--the

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.339
reason I put it in
quotes--;"working class

00:20:41.339 --> 00:20:42.400
consciousness."
 

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.202
We were sort of children of the
very late or the 1960s or 1970s

00:20:46.202 --> 00:20:49.700
and everybody wanted to follow
the great English historian

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.215
E.P. Thompson,
who wrote a monumental book

00:20:52.215 --> 00:20:56.019
called The Making of the
English Working Class.

00:20:56.019 --> 00:21:00.684
Everybody wanted to find the
making of class-conscious

00:21:00.684 --> 00:21:03.150
workers in various places.
 

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.940
Everybody wanted to study the
crowd,

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.559
as in The Crowd in the
French Revolution,

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:09.226
my late friend,
George Rudé's famous

00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:12.045
book,
the crowd here or the crowd

00:21:12.045 --> 00:21:12.690
there.
 

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.308
The first article I ever
published was called "The

00:21:15.308 --> 00:21:17.930
Crowd in the Affair du Limoges,
April 27,1848."

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.640
Now I look back sometimes and I
think, "Who cares?"

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.598
But anyway, in the 1980s the
move kind of turned away from

00:21:24.598 --> 00:21:29.558
that and more people started
studying the middle class.

00:21:29.558 --> 00:21:33.339
More about the middle class
folk in the nineteenth century

00:21:33.339 --> 00:21:36.655
and what my friend,
Peter Gay, called the bourgeois

00:21:36.655 --> 00:21:38.578
century next time around.
 

00:21:38.578 --> 00:21:41.776
Nonetheless,
you can't throw out the baby

00:21:41.776 --> 00:21:45.770
with the bathwater,
and class remains a fundamental

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:46.730
concept.
 

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.398
If you're going to understand
nineteenth and twentieth century

00:21:50.398 --> 00:21:52.984
Europe, you have to understand
social class,

00:21:52.984 --> 00:21:54.788
because there's a reality.
 

00:21:54.788 --> 00:21:59.573
We live in a country now where
people like to think there are

00:21:59.573 --> 00:22:00.608
no classes.
 

00:22:00.608 --> 00:22:04.920
Well, don't get me going on the
current economic crisis.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.712
I can remember people going
down to the Ford plant in

00:22:08.712 --> 00:22:13.308
Ypsilanti and Detroit and trying
to get people who work in those

00:22:13.308 --> 00:22:18.410
places interested in the war,
against the war in Vietnam,

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:21.334
and getting absolutely nowhere
and hearing arguments that in

00:22:21.334 --> 00:22:22.920
America we don't have classes.
 

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:23.980
That simply isn't true.
 

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.782
Anyway, in the nineteenth
century social class was a real

00:22:28.782 --> 00:22:29.470
thing.
 

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:34.598
Nobody had a stronger class
identity than the middle class.

00:22:34.598 --> 00:22:36.079
That's what I'm going to talk
about next time.

00:22:36.079 --> 00:22:41.170
I can hardly wait.
 

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.131
There was a working class,
but not everybody saw

00:22:44.131 --> 00:22:47.029
themselves as workers,
as a form of identity as

00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:48.920
opposed to something else.
 

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.000
People can have multiple
identities.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.617
When we talk about nationalism,
that's an obvious point to

00:22:53.617 --> 00:22:53.940
make.
 

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:57.022
If you ask people who they are,
they might say they're

00:22:57.022 --> 00:23:00.011
Protestant or they're Jewish or
they're Catholic or they're

00:23:00.011 --> 00:23:03.104
Muslim or they might say they're
from this extended family or

00:23:03.104 --> 00:23:04.650
they're from this region.
 

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:11.098
They're Bavarian or whatever.
 

00:23:11.098 --> 00:23:15.660
In the nineteenth century-class
identity, the sense of being

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.829
workers as a class apart was a
reality.

00:23:18.829 --> 00:23:21.200
That's just the way it is.
 

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.355
That was worth studying and
people did some very good work

00:23:24.355 --> 00:23:24.799
on it.
 

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.529
It's kind of come back, too.
 

00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:29.660
It's kind of come back.
 

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:36.005
Anyone who's been in Britain,
where class identity is so

00:23:36.005 --> 00:23:39.490
revealed by language,
there isn't anyplace,

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:44.346
including France or any place
else that I know where a

00:23:44.346 --> 00:23:49.480
difference in accent is so
revealing as to not only where

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.382
you are from,
but who you are in terms of

00:23:53.382 --> 00:23:54.549
social class.
 

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:56.818
It's really just amazing.
 

00:23:56.818 --> 00:24:00.079
It remains true in France and
some other places.

00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:01.608
There was a strangler.
 

00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:03.618
There are always these
stranglers around in Britain.

00:24:03.618 --> 00:24:06.345
There was one guy was this
hardcore killer,

00:24:06.345 --> 00:24:10.368
a bad guy killing a bunch of
people about fifteen years ago.

00:24:10.368 --> 00:24:13.571
Finally, they get all these
experts on language and he

00:24:13.571 --> 00:24:17.017
called up I guess a radio
station and sort of "Here I

00:24:17.017 --> 00:24:17.440
am.
 

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.338
Come and get me"
kind of thing.

00:24:19.338 --> 00:24:22.847
They had him pegged where he
was within something like ten

00:24:22.847 --> 00:24:25.432
miles of where they ended up
arresting him,

00:24:25.432 --> 00:24:28.450
which is in Bradford in the
north of England.

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:33.578
Language is one of the ways
that people reveal their class.

00:24:33.578 --> 00:24:37.700
In the nineteenth century we're
talking about workers and how

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.416
some workers,
but not all,

00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:42.440
began to see themselves as
proletarians.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.424
That seems like one of those
trendy words,

00:24:44.424 --> 00:24:46.118
but it meant something to
people.

00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:51.830
A proletarian is somebody
dependent on their own labor,

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.320
usually unskilled or
semi-skilled,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.858
in order to survive.
 

00:24:57.858 --> 00:24:59.705
There are two aspects to the
term

00:24:59.705 --> 00:25:01.608
"proletarianization."
 

00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:09.509
One is kind of the objective
sense that you are a laborer.

00:25:09.509 --> 00:25:10.818
You may be a harvester.
 

00:25:10.818 --> 00:25:13.118
You may pick grapes for the
wine harvest.

00:25:13.118 --> 00:25:18.230
You may be carrying around
large boxes,

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.425
which is what I did at Alice
Love's Jams and Jellies in

00:25:21.425 --> 00:25:24.654
Portland, Oregon,
or at Kellogg's of Battle

00:25:24.654 --> 00:25:26.420
Creek,
where I also worked,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:30.334
totally unskilled,
but again that was not going to

00:25:30.334 --> 00:25:34.858
be my lifelong identity,
because I was able to go on to

00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:36.380
do something else.
 

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:43.232
But in Europe you were born
into the proletariat in most

00:25:43.232 --> 00:25:44.230
cases.
 

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.838
If you grew up as a Catholic,
in this part of France,

00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:50.589
you still would have been a
practicing Catholic,

00:25:50.589 --> 00:25:55.148
a Catholic guy,
a young boy or young woman in

00:25:55.148 --> 00:25:58.779
and around Saint Etienne or in
Lille,

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:02.338
the chances were overwhelming
that you were going to follow

00:26:02.338 --> 00:26:04.180
your parents into the mines.
 

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.549
You were going to go in the
mines.

00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:07.692
As a matter of fact,
again I hate giving these

00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:10.176
French examples,
but there's an expression

00:26:10.176 --> 00:26:13.770
that's really only used there
that I've ever heard when a kid

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.644
screws up,
does something he's not

00:26:15.644 --> 00:26:16.230
supposed to.
 

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.358
What they say is deux
semaines dessous une benne,

00:26:19.358 --> 00:26:23.096
 which is if you spend two
weeks ducking down like this and

00:26:23.096 --> 00:26:26.594
having to help guide this cart
full of coal up and down the

00:26:26.594 --> 00:26:29.848
railroad tracks,
you won't screw up like that

00:26:29.848 --> 00:26:31.200
again, little boy.
 

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.910
The sense of you were born into
the world of work.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.190
In America there were all these
kinds of literature,

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.183
the equivalent of Boys
Life about remarkable

00:26:41.183 --> 00:26:44.380
assents into the social
stratosphere,

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:46.019
that America was the land of
opportunity.

00:26:46.019 --> 00:26:48.663
Well, America was the land of
opportunity, to be sure,

00:26:48.663 --> 00:26:50.058
with availability of land.
 

00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:54.990
But cases of social mobility
were actually fairly limited.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:58.750
This was certainly the case in
almost all of Europe.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:02.787
You were essentially born into,
for most people,

00:27:02.787 --> 00:27:03.990
this status.
 

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.678
The other thing that happened,
and this explains the rise of

00:27:07.678 --> 00:27:12.132
class consciousness,
is that people who--suddenly

00:27:12.132 --> 00:27:17.424
the bottom drops out of their
economic life--that's a fairly

00:27:17.424 --> 00:27:22.180
appropriate analogy for
today--who were artisans,

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.670
who were craftsmen,
become really the first,

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.259
depending on where we're
talking about.

00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:29.446
It begins really about the turn
of the century,

00:27:29.446 --> 00:27:31.799
that is,
1800 or slightly before,

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:35.750
but mostly afterward,
by 1830 in England and then

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:40.269
follows in other countries in
many, many places.

00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:44.598
Artisans and craftsmen are
really the first to see

00:27:44.598 --> 00:27:47.250
themselves as a class apart.
 

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.329
Not unskilled workers.
 

00:27:49.329 --> 00:27:50.039
Why?
 

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:51.180
This is pretty obvious.
 

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.970
Artisans and craftsmen are
educated up to a point.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.940
They have a sense of dignity
about their trades.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.578
They have organizations.
 

00:28:00.578 --> 00:28:03.269
They have mutual aid societies,
for example.

00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:06.665
There's a craft guild
organization in France called

00:28:06.665 --> 00:28:08.500
the compagnonnage.
 

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.122
This came from the medieval
times when they built the big

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:12.480
cathedrals and all of that.
 

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.858
They have organization.
 

00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:16.368
They have a sense of pride in
craft dignity.

00:28:16.368 --> 00:28:18.832
Karl Marx, who was a pretty
smart guy, he got a lot of

00:28:18.832 --> 00:28:20.644
things wrong,
but he got a lot of things

00:28:20.644 --> 00:28:21.108
right.
 

00:28:21.108 --> 00:28:25.433
Karl Marx wrote in the 1830s
and 1940s about how workers'

00:28:25.433 --> 00:28:27.210
wages were declining.
 

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:29.769
He was right for artisans.
 

00:28:29.769 --> 00:28:31.048
There's no question about it.
 

00:28:31.048 --> 00:28:34.363
Artisans are at the forefront
of every single social and

00:28:34.363 --> 00:28:37.556
political movement that you can
think of in the French

00:28:37.556 --> 00:28:38.460
Revolution.
 

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.400
There we go.
 

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.578
Who stormed the Bastille?
 

00:28:40.578 --> 00:28:44.932
It was artisans,
1830 in France,

00:28:44.932 --> 00:28:50.410
1848 in Austria,
in Berlin, in Paris.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.710
It was artisans.
 

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.108
Why all of a sudden do they get
mad?

00:28:54.108 --> 00:28:57.959
There's really two reasons,
two things that happened to

00:28:57.959 --> 00:29:01.522
artisans that caused their
economic situation to go

00:29:01.522 --> 00:29:02.450
downhill.
 

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.086
First of all,
the French Revolution or the

00:29:05.086 --> 00:29:08.558
effects of the French Revolution
destroy the guilds.

00:29:08.558 --> 00:29:14.205
Anybody can be a tailor or a
shoemaker or whatever,

00:29:14.205 --> 00:29:15.900
a glassmaker.
 

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:19.784
If you learn the skills,
there's no one who's going to

00:29:19.784 --> 00:29:22.568
say no, you can't get in this
union.

00:29:22.568 --> 00:29:25.028
You might be able to get in
this mutual aid society or

00:29:25.028 --> 00:29:26.974
friendly society,
but you can't do the work

00:29:26.974 --> 00:29:28.460
because the guilds are gone.
 

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:35.782
The French Revolution banishes
the guilds, laissez faire,

00:29:35.782 --> 00:29:40.359
Adam Smith, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:43.118
There are laws against unions.
 

00:29:43.118 --> 00:29:47.230
Strikes are not legal in France
until 1864.

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:50.432
The corporation acts are
reinforced by the fear in

00:29:50.432 --> 00:29:52.720
Britain of the French
Revolution.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.623
But what happens is you've got
what can be called,

00:29:55.623 --> 00:29:59.119
Bill Sewell has called it that,
a friend of mine in Chicago,

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:00.778
the crisis of expansion.
 

00:30:00.778 --> 00:30:03.097
You've got all these people now
who say, "Hey,

00:30:03.097 --> 00:30:04.858
I'm going to be a tailor,
too."

00:30:04.858 --> 00:30:09.680
If you lived in Berlin or
someplace in the 1840s,

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.730
you would hear tailors walking
along the street pushing carts

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:17.711
full of clothes that they had
made from the beginning to the

00:30:17.711 --> 00:30:19.893
end,
of suits being sold for

00:30:19.893 --> 00:30:21.329
practically nothing.
 

00:30:21.329 --> 00:30:22.328
Why?
 

00:30:22.328 --> 00:30:25.950
Because there's so many other
people making suits as well.

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:29.346
Also, mechanized production
means that you can buy suits off

00:30:29.346 --> 00:30:32.798
the rack, and they're getting
very little for their suits.

00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:35.638
They didn't wake up and think,
"Gee, I can't remember how

00:30:35.638 --> 00:30:36.710
to make a suit."
 

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:37.730
They got these suits.
 

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:39.670
They can make them and they
can't sell them.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.819
Their wages are declining.
 

00:30:40.819 --> 00:30:41.690
Are they mad?
 

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:42.789
They're furious.
 

00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:44.009
Who do they blame?
 

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:48.154
They blame the state and they
blame the bourgeoisie,

00:30:48.154 --> 00:30:50.920
the middle class,
the middlemen.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.295
For example,
in the case of tailors,

00:30:52.295 --> 00:30:54.259
there are a lot of middlemen
who've got capital.

00:30:54.259 --> 00:30:55.130
What do you do?
 

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.416
You say, "Look,
I'm going to get a bunch of

00:30:57.416 --> 00:30:58.048
suits made.
 

00:30:58.048 --> 00:30:59.834
Here are all these tailors,
they don't have enough to

00:30:59.834 --> 00:31:00.278
work."
 

00:31:00.278 --> 00:31:03.560
I'm not giving you a very good
example, because I don't know a

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.390
damn thing about being a tailor.
 

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:08.317
But they say,
"Okay, you guys do the

00:31:08.317 --> 00:31:09.048
sleeves.
 

00:31:09.048 --> 00:31:11.288
You guys do the pants,
because you can do them all one

00:31:11.288 --> 00:31:13.993
after another and you don't have
to worry about doing the rest of

00:31:13.993 --> 00:31:14.288
it.
 

00:31:14.288 --> 00:31:16.588
Then I'll pick up everything
that you make."

00:31:16.588 --> 00:31:19.660
This is a continuation of rural
industry.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.348
"Then I will sell it in
the markets."

00:31:22.348 --> 00:31:28.593
Into World War I you still had
single women in Paris now

00:31:28.593 --> 00:31:34.269
chained to their sewing machine,
not literally,

00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:36.058
but they've got to pay off
their sewing machine.

00:31:36.058 --> 00:31:38.693
The sewing machine starts
before electricity,

00:31:38.693 --> 00:31:40.849
but after electricity comes
along.

00:31:40.849 --> 00:31:42.660
They're working by themselves.
 

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.390
Their day isn't cut short
anymore by the end of daylight.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:53.362
It's cut short by sheer fatigue
and producing these goods for

00:31:53.362 --> 00:31:54.990
this market.
 

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.714
These tailors,
and shoemakers,

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:59.036
and all of that,
they're in every single

00:31:59.036 --> 00:31:59.808
movement.
 

00:31:59.808 --> 00:32:01.648
They are the ones who first
say, "Hey,

00:32:01.648 --> 00:32:02.348
you know what?
 

00:32:02.348 --> 00:32:05.420
All we workers,
we've got some stuff in common.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.207
This is amplified by
residential patterns,

00:32:08.207 --> 00:32:11.130
people living in and around
where they work,

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:12.828
et cetera, et cetera.
 

00:32:12.828 --> 00:32:15.566
Mechanization also,
I'll give you an example that I

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:18.028
do know something about which is
porcelain.

00:32:18.028 --> 00:32:22.038
Porcelain is one of these
products that's a luxury good.

00:32:22.038 --> 00:32:25.452
Renoir, the great painter,
started out--he was born in

00:32:25.452 --> 00:32:29.509
Limoges, France in 1841--Renoir
starts out decorating plates.

00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:31.200
He painted plates.
 

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:36.088
Along comes this new
technological innovation.

00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:39.318
If you did, and I only did very
briefly,

00:32:39.318 --> 00:32:42.519
make those model airplanes and
stuff like that,

00:32:42.519 --> 00:32:45.852
there were little decals that
you'd stick on the plane to

00:32:45.852 --> 00:32:49.020
represent the Spitfire,
or whatever American fighters

00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:49.578
or boats.
 

00:32:49.578 --> 00:32:52.663
I'm not such a war guy,
so I stopped that pretty

00:32:52.663 --> 00:32:53.318
quickly.
 

00:32:53.318 --> 00:32:57.944
So, somebody invents one of
these decals that can be baked

00:32:57.944 --> 00:33:02.247
on to high quality plates
between the first and second

00:33:02.247 --> 00:33:03.140
baking.
 

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.009
Porcelain remains a luxury good.
 

00:33:07.009 --> 00:33:10.867
The people that used to paint
them are sent to the warehouse

00:33:10.867 --> 00:33:14.726
where they work for about a
third of what they would make as

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.098
skilled painters.
 

00:33:16.098 --> 00:33:18.132
They didn't wake up one day and
say, "Geez,

00:33:18.132 --> 00:33:20.509
I can't remember how you paint
a plate anymore."

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:23.105
No one's going to pay them to
paint plates except for very

00:33:23.105 --> 00:33:23.880
special orders.
 

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.650
Glassmaking is the same thing.
 

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:30.358
People that formed bottles used
to be very well paid.

00:33:30.358 --> 00:33:34.664
Then a machine is invented that
comes along and does the same

00:33:34.664 --> 00:33:35.240
thing.
 

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:39.386
It turns out bottles by the
zillions to be filled with wine

00:33:39.386 --> 00:33:40.460
and whatever.
 

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.099
They're out of luck.
 

00:33:43.099 --> 00:33:44.130
Are they mad?
 

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:45.210
They're furious.
 

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.422
Pretty soon they start
thinking, "You know these

00:33:47.422 --> 00:33:49.165
unskilled people,
we have some of the same

00:33:49.165 --> 00:33:50.058
grievances."
 

00:33:50.058 --> 00:33:53.720
They begin seeing themselves as
a class apart.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:59.012
Class consciousness isn't sort
of an invention of lefties from

00:33:59.012 --> 00:34:01.529
the 1970s like yours truly.
 

00:34:01.529 --> 00:34:02.509
It's not at all.
 

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:03.740
It was a reality.
 

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:06.295
It wasn't for everybody,
but if you read a lot of

00:34:06.295 --> 00:34:08.704
literature,
especially from London or from

00:34:08.704 --> 00:34:11.994
anywhere about the kinds of
solidarities that people had

00:34:11.994 --> 00:34:16.407
because of their social class,
and the sense that they formed

00:34:16.407 --> 00:34:20.688
a class apart and were relegated
to sort of a permanent

00:34:20.688 --> 00:34:25.128
proletarian status by forces
that they can't control--the

00:34:25.128 --> 00:34:28.380
state and big money and big
capital.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.519
People would be a little better
off if they were thinking about

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:30.900
that now.
 

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:33.880
Anyway, that's that.
 

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.378
Having said that,
I want to turn in the last ten

00:34:37.378 --> 00:34:40.059
minutes to--did I get all that
in?

00:34:40.059 --> 00:34:41.268
Yes!
 

00:34:41.268 --> 00:34:47.010
I want to turn to something
that complements that.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:51.340
That is a discussion of
industrial discipline.

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:57.030
One thing as workers learn to
strike,

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:03.139
going on to strike for better
working conditions,

00:35:03.139 --> 00:35:07.380
for more money,
for better hours,

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:10.760
shorter hours,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.630
one has to imagine what the
world looked like for them.

00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:19.250
What did they think about
things that were happening to

00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.719
them?
 

00:35:19.719 --> 00:35:24.853
One of the things that had
happened to them was this sort

00:35:24.853 --> 00:35:30.355
of nineteenth-century end stage
of the Industrial Revolution,

00:35:30.355 --> 00:35:33.289
that is, factory production.
 

00:35:33.289 --> 00:35:36.804
If you were an artisan,
if you were a tailor--I keep

00:35:36.804 --> 00:35:40.056
using these examples,
but they're so stuck in my

00:35:40.056 --> 00:35:44.108
mind--or shoemaker,
you basically worked when you

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:44.768
wanted.
 

00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:52.909
You worked in response to
demand for your product.

00:35:52.909 --> 00:35:56.646
Many of these people were on
the move, going from one place

00:35:56.646 --> 00:35:57.550
to the next.
 

00:35:57.550 --> 00:36:02.365
But you worked kind of when you
wanted to, or when there was a

00:36:02.365 --> 00:36:04.420
demand for your product.
 

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:08.251
If you were in domestic
industry, and you were a woman

00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:12.373
working in the hinterland of
Zurich, you worked when there

00:36:12.373 --> 00:36:14.469
was demand for your work.
 

00:36:14.469 --> 00:36:18.460
Then you took time off to nurse
your child or to take account of

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.929
the family to see how we were
doing,

00:36:20.929 --> 00:36:23.820
if there was enough to tie
through until the next week.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.809
You more or less worked on your
own.

00:36:27.809 --> 00:36:32.199
A pottery baron called Josiah
Wedgwood,

00:36:32.199 --> 00:36:34.119
you've probably heard of
Wedgwood pottery,

00:36:34.119 --> 00:36:38.793
just before 1800 he's trying to
think about how you make all

00:36:38.793 --> 00:36:43.704
these workers that he had-- how
do you make them respond in the

00:36:43.704 --> 00:36:46.965
very same way,
so they don't just kind of get

00:36:46.965 --> 00:36:50.710
up and wander off or spend time
talking or enjoying themselves?

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:54.969
How do you get them all to work
at his single command?

00:36:54.969 --> 00:37:01.016
His dream, his fantasy was that
he wanted a set of workers that

00:37:01.016 --> 00:37:05.989
responded as fingers on two
hands in response to his

00:37:05.989 --> 00:37:07.159
command.
 

00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:09.440
That's what he wants.
 

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:18.039
He and his successors create
strategies of doing just that.

00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:22.186
In doing so they launch this
sort of protracted struggle,

00:37:22.186 --> 00:37:26.630
which is very revealing about
the bigger processes at play in

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:28.630
the nineteenth century.
 

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:34.940
Factories have a lot to do with
that.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:39.746
Hereto, I say that with such
intensity for my bad experiences

00:37:39.746 --> 00:37:41.590
working in factories.
 

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:45.929
I once was working in Alice
Love's Jams and Jellies.

00:37:45.929 --> 00:37:50.869
I was supposed to be to work
about 6:00 in the morning after

00:37:50.869 --> 00:37:54.219
a night I probably shouldn't
have had.

00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:57.110
The last thing I remember was
the guy.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.590
He didn't like me because I was
a college guy.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:02.039
I always had my mighty maize
and blue Michigan shirt on.

00:38:02.039 --> 00:38:07.079
He said, "Listen,
idiot"--I was on jams and

00:38:07.079 --> 00:38:08.340
jelly duty.
 

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.389
There was a huge machine.
 

00:38:09.389 --> 00:38:13.550
You have to imagine an enormous
accordion.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.920
They'd put all these berries in
there.

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.699
Then the press would squeeze
them into jelly,

00:38:18.699 --> 00:38:22.110
which we would drink or eat and
make ourselves sick.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.561
It would build up a lot of
pressure and the last thing I

00:38:24.561 --> 00:38:26.389
remember him saying was,
"Listen,

00:38:26.389 --> 00:38:30.231
idiot," that was me,
"don't leave your finger

00:38:30.231 --> 00:38:31.900
on that button very long."
 

00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:35.490
As I was trying to figure out
who had beaten whom the night

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.650
before in the American League,
the thing blew up.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:42.501
This enormous tidal wave of
boysenberry juice engulfed me

00:38:42.501 --> 00:38:43.809
and I was burned.
 

00:38:43.809 --> 00:38:47.539
Actually, I was out on sick
leave for two weeks or I was

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:51.539
just down playing basketball and
getting paid to do that.

00:38:51.539 --> 00:38:53.876
This tidal wave of
boysenberries,

00:38:53.876 --> 00:38:58.405
a forklift with about something
like 2,000 jars of apple butter

00:38:58.405 --> 00:39:00.159
spun out of control.
 

00:39:00.159 --> 00:39:02.079
It was a terrible,
terrible mess.

00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:04.449
But the point of this is that I
hated the foreman.

00:39:04.449 --> 00:39:08.007
As I left, I said,
"Too bad for you,

00:39:08.007 --> 00:39:09.429
foreman."
 

00:39:09.429 --> 00:39:10.380
I take that back.
 

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.969
I didn't say that.
 

00:39:11.969 --> 00:39:16.534
Anyway, the point of this is
that factories become first of

00:39:16.534 --> 00:39:20.389
all a way of maintaining
industrial discipline.

00:39:20.389 --> 00:39:23.335
In the first factories in
Britain they were not there

00:39:23.335 --> 00:39:26.789
because you had these machines
that were there immediately.

00:39:26.789 --> 00:39:30.081
James Watts' steam engine was
not used really for about

00:39:30.081 --> 00:39:33.617
fifteen years after it was made,
because there weren't many

00:39:33.617 --> 00:39:35.018
things it could do.
 

00:39:35.018 --> 00:39:39.340
The first factories were there
putting together artisans,

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.351
semi-skilled workers,
and unskilled workers as a form

00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:45.590
of industrial discipline.
 

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.498
When you think,
if you see postcards--at the

00:39:47.498 --> 00:39:50.250
end of the nineteenth century,
really about 1900,

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.039
the craze for postcards begins
in Europe and in the United

00:39:54.039 --> 00:39:54.969
States, too.
 

00:39:54.969 --> 00:39:57.391
Now, these postcards are
extremely expensive if they have

00:39:57.391 --> 00:39:59.380
people in them,
particularly people at work.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.188
They're really,
really--and I have all sorts of

00:40:02.188 --> 00:40:05.606
them from Limoges and the
porcelain industry and from the

00:40:05.606 --> 00:40:06.340
strikes.
 

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.840
But if you see these pictures,
when workers had their pictures

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.422
taken together,
they're always in front of the

00:40:12.422 --> 00:40:12.940
door.
 

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.449
Why?
 

00:40:15.449 --> 00:40:18.190
You had to enter the door or
leave the door.

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:21.835
The signal was given by the
clock and by the bell that

00:40:21.835 --> 00:40:23.280
called you to work.
 

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.679
If you were late,
too bad for you.

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:27.561
You could be docked or fired,
and there are lots more people

00:40:27.561 --> 00:40:29.809
out there who would like to have
those jobs.

00:40:29.809 --> 00:40:34.699
What happens in the nineteenth
century is that the factory,

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:42.050
before really its role as a
houser of big thundering

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:45.990
machines,
in many places the factory was

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:50.340
first and foremost a way of
putting discipline on workers.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:52.320
There's a terrible case in
Brooklyn,

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.010
I think in 1912 or something,
where 150 or 200 women were

00:40:56.010 --> 00:41:00.099
burned to death because the
bosses or the foreman had locked

00:41:00.099 --> 00:41:02.447
the doors,
so they couldn't go out and

00:41:02.447 --> 00:41:03.518
"chatter."
 

00:41:03.518 --> 00:41:06.059
What they begin to do in the
middle of the nineteenth century

00:41:06.059 --> 00:41:08.438
is have rules,
regulations for work,

00:41:08.438 --> 00:41:10.639
what you can do,
what you can't do,

00:41:10.639 --> 00:41:12.739
and what you must do.
 

00:41:12.739 --> 00:41:13.639
You can't talk.
 

00:41:13.639 --> 00:41:16.967
If you were a porcelain worker
and something blew up in the

00:41:16.967 --> 00:41:19.320
oven, that was docked from your
salary.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:26.219
In order to watch over these
workers, they bring in the

00:41:26.219 --> 00:41:29.159
foreman, fore-people.
 

00:41:29.159 --> 00:41:34.849
There was a strike in Limoges
because the fore-person,

00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:37.827
a woman,
was very religious and she made

00:41:37.827 --> 00:41:41.362
the workers kneel down on the
ground and pray with their knees

00:41:41.362 --> 00:41:43.449
on the stone before work
started.

00:41:43.449 --> 00:41:47.500
No separation of church and
work there.

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:51.130
They bring in foremen who are
going to enforce these--to see

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:54.329
if you're a good worker or if
you're a bad worker.

00:41:54.329 --> 00:41:56.559
Now, workers resent this very
much.

00:41:56.559 --> 00:41:59.900
How did workers view the
bosses, for example?

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.056
In the 1820s and 1830s,
you're still working in smaller

00:42:03.056 --> 00:42:06.447
units of production in most
places in Europe if you're in a

00:42:06.447 --> 00:42:07.150
factory.
 

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.670
You've got an issue with the
boss.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.922
The boss is somebody who might
give you a little extra on

00:42:11.922 --> 00:42:13.369
Christmas, or something like
that.

00:42:13.369 --> 00:42:15.719
The boss is somebody you knew.
 

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:17.864
There was a sense of,
"Well, you're not doing me

00:42:17.864 --> 00:42:18.360
right now.
 

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.972
This isn't right and I'm going
to leave until you get it

00:42:20.972 --> 00:42:22.730
together and do better by
me."

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.360
The boss is a presence.
 

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.632
He's there all the time,
as my boss at Dennis Uniform

00:42:27.632 --> 00:42:30.086
Manufacturing Company,
also in Portland,

00:42:30.086 --> 00:42:30.780
Oregon.
 

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:33.110
He was there all the time.
 

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.768
By the time the foremen start
coming in, the foreman is

00:42:35.768 --> 00:42:36.949
representing the boss.
 

00:42:36.949 --> 00:42:40.686
The foreman is somebody who's
brought in from the outside or

00:42:40.686 --> 00:42:43.219
promoted, often unjustly,
from within.

00:42:43.219 --> 00:42:47.340
The foreman replaces the boss
as the one who's hitting on the

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.920
young female workers.
 

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:54.976
They call it in French the
droit de cuissage--that's

00:42:54.976 --> 00:43:00.510
rather crude--the right of
hitting on and scoring,

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:05.898
putting oneself in a power
relationship with a female

00:43:05.898 --> 00:43:07.039
employee.
 

00:43:07.039 --> 00:43:09.760
The foreman begins to represent
the boss.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:13.481
The boss now during strikes,
the language of workers during

00:43:13.481 --> 00:43:16.239
strikes is, "The boss,
he's a letch.

00:43:16.239 --> 00:43:17.510
He's a drunk.
 

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.579
He eats too much."
 

00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:19.909
He doesn't care whether you
live or die.

00:43:19.909 --> 00:43:23.246
He's still somebody you see
kind of walking through and all

00:43:23.246 --> 00:43:23.650
that.
 

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:26.349
You don't like him that much,
but he's still a presence.

00:43:26.349 --> 00:43:28.675
The strikes at the end of the
nineteenth century are very,

00:43:28.675 --> 00:43:29.369
very different.
 

00:43:29.369 --> 00:43:31.630
The boss often is a very
distant person.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:37.106
He's sending telegrams from
London or sending telegrams from

00:43:37.106 --> 00:43:41.750
Frankfurt to his foreman
demanding this or that.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:43.809
In the case of a strike in
Limoges, France,

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:47.530
the owner of the factory was an
American called David Haviland,

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:51.221
as in Haviland porcelain,
at one point actually demands

00:43:51.221 --> 00:43:51.989
that the U.S.
 

00:43:51.989 --> 00:43:53.893
Embassy send in the
U.S. Marines,

00:43:53.893 --> 00:43:57.045
as if that was possible in
order to put an end to this

00:43:57.045 --> 00:43:59.900
disturbance, this disorder in
his factory.

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:04.112
He or she has become a symbol
of capitalism,

00:44:04.112 --> 00:44:09.110
protected by the state and
protected by the army.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:13.347
This is how workers,
not all workers,

00:44:13.347 --> 00:44:17.469
but in many cases,
view the boss.

00:44:17.469 --> 00:44:23.322
Industrial discipline has been
imposed by these rules,

00:44:23.322 --> 00:44:27.630
these regulations,
and these foreman.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.800
If you don't like it, too bad.
 

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.521
Women workers are no longer
allowed to nurse their children,

00:44:34.521 --> 00:44:37.929
to bring their children or to
go out and nurse them.

00:44:37.929 --> 00:44:41.380
They are forced to eat inside
the factory.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:45.125
That's why tuberculosis rates
are enormous,

00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:48.869
particularly in mining and in
factories.

00:44:48.869 --> 00:44:50.380
You'll see this in
Germinal.

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:53.460
It's really kind of an amazing
book.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:58.963
This view of workers of their
bosses tells you something about

00:44:58.963 --> 00:45:02.150
this long process,
it's very uneven and not

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:05.971
everywhere,
but still there--that explain

00:45:05.971 --> 00:45:12.643
this massive kind of movements
of strikes that you found in all

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:17.487
sorts of countries--Northern
Italy, Barcelona,

00:45:17.487 --> 00:45:19.639
Moscow in 1917.
 

00:45:19.639 --> 00:45:24.780
Huge strikes would be terribly
important in 1917 in Moscow.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.329
Then something else happens,
and I'm going to end with this,

00:45:28.329 --> 00:45:33.869
because it's in a minor way an
amazing tale about a colleague,

00:45:33.869 --> 00:45:36.449
a brilliant woman I know called
Michelle Perrot,

00:45:36.449 --> 00:45:39.239
something she wrote in the late
1970s.

00:45:39.239 --> 00:45:42.309
It tells you so much about our
time.

00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:45.992
In the beginning of the
twentieth century an American

00:45:45.992 --> 00:45:48.400
engineer called Taylor comes up.
 

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.936
Remember, this is the time when
the Olympics have started up

00:45:50.936 --> 00:45:51.280
again.
 

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:55.179
You measure how fast people can
run the 100 or how far they can

00:45:55.179 --> 00:45:56.500
throw the shot-put.
 

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:57.849
You're measuring things.
 

00:45:57.849 --> 00:46:00.460
Car races have begun.
 

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.333
Bicycle race,
which was a bloody spectacle

00:46:03.333 --> 00:46:06.909
with bikes careening out of
control all the time.

00:46:06.909 --> 00:46:10.159
You see working class heroes
getting just mangled,

00:46:10.159 --> 00:46:14.137
in part through each other's
manipulations of trying to knock

00:46:14.137 --> 00:46:15.000
them off.
 

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.449
But you're measuring things.
 

00:46:16.449 --> 00:46:19.507
Taylor comes up with this way
of measuring units of

00:46:19.507 --> 00:46:22.690
production, the ultimate in
industrial discipline.

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:24.170
You were on the assembly line.
 

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:27.951
They will count the number of
units you can do of jars of

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:30.449
apple butter that you can turn
out.

00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:33.295
If you're not turning out
enough, "See ya',

00:46:33.295 --> 00:46:34.869
we'll get somebody else.
 

00:46:34.869 --> 00:46:36.210
A lot of people want that job.
 

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:36.809
We'll see ya'."
 

00:46:36.809 --> 00:46:38.989
That's why the wages stay down,
because there are a lot of

00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:40.940
people who want those jobs
because of the growth.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:46.219
He becomes the darling of the
French car manufacturers.

00:46:46.219 --> 00:46:49.210
He becomes the darling.
 

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.340
He is a hot item.
 

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:53.280
He would be on People
magazine,

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:56.449
if they did have one,
because he comes and tells them

00:46:56.449 --> 00:46:59.690
how they can get more effort out
of their tired,

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.269
fatigued workers by counting
them.

00:47:02.269 --> 00:47:06.260
It's just like that all the way.
 

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.103
Michelle Perrot,
when she wrote a brilliant

00:47:09.103 --> 00:47:11.440
article and edited a book I did
a long time ago,

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.989
her article was called
"The Three Ages of

00:47:13.989 --> 00:47:15.690
Industrial Discipline."
 

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.750
She had an amazing phrase for
the late 1970s.

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.179
This was before,
thank god, cell phones.

00:47:21.179 --> 00:47:25.900
It was before personal
computers and all of that.

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.302
There were computers,
but they weren't personal

00:47:28.302 --> 00:47:28.929
computers.
 

00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:33.380
She said that in this
post-industrial age,

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.992
where you've got the rust belt,
and you've got factories being

00:47:36.992 --> 00:47:39.061
torn down outside Detroit,
and in Flint,

00:47:39.061 --> 00:47:41.034
and in Torrington,
and Waterbury,

00:47:41.034 --> 00:47:43.159
and places like that,
in Pittsburg,

00:47:43.159 --> 00:47:46.782
and almost anywhere you can
name that was the heart of the

00:47:46.782 --> 00:47:48.880
American industrial experience.
 

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:55.211
She predicted in 1978 that what
would replace Taylorism would be

00:47:55.211 --> 00:47:56.719
the computer.
 

00:47:56.719 --> 00:48:01.469
The computer will measure in
your cubicles your performance.

00:48:01.469 --> 00:48:06.233
She said in the end,
the foreman would be replaced

00:48:06.233 --> 00:48:11.289
by "the quiet violence of
the computer."

00:48:11.289 --> 00:48:12.829
Kind of amazing.
 

00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:13.699
See you on Wednesday.

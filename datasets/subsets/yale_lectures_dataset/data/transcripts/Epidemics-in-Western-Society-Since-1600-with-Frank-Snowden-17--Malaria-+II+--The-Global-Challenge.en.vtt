00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:06.115
Prof: What I want to do
this morning is first of all

00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:10.648
begin by recapitulating a couple
of points that we made last

00:00:10.648 --> 00:00:11.340
time.
 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.270
You'll recognize our friend
here, having her blood feast,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.836
and last time we talked about
the importance of malaria in

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:26.413
human history for a little bit,
from ancient times to the

00:00:26.413 --> 00:00:30.580
contemporary world,
and we tried to suggest that

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.522
malaria continues to impose an
extraordinary burden of

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:40.780
suffering and death,
along with those consequences

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.530
that follow in its train:
poverty,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.091
low productivity,
illiteracy, a low level of

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:52.978
political,
social and education

00:00:52.978 --> 00:00:54.860
participation.
 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.494
We also talked,
as you'll remember,

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:01.677
about the transmission of the
disease, with the complex

00:01:01.677 --> 00:01:06.250
lifecycle of plasmodia and
Anopheles mosquitoes.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.123
We talked about the effect of
the disease on the human body of

00:01:11.123 --> 00:01:15.360
the patient and symptoms that
result from malaria,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.153
and we tried to deal also with
the great years of discovery at

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:24.099
the end of the 1890s,
between 1898 and 1901,

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:28.965
when the great mysteries of
this disease were largely

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:32.430
unraveled in two different
places.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.797
First in India,
with the collaboration of

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:40.961
Ronald Ross and Patrick Manson,
they demonstrated the mosquito

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:45.180
transmission of malaria with
regard to avian malaria--

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.560
that is, among birds.
 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.440
And then the other place,
even more importantly,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.239
was Italy, where Giovanni
Battista Grassi and other

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:00.188
scientists of what was called
the Italian School,

00:02:00.188 --> 00:02:04.575
or the Rome School,
proved the mosquito theory of

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:07.500
transmission for human beings.
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.675
I hope that in that discussion,
it was apparent to all of you

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:18.110
that malaria is by far the most
complex of all the diseases that

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.508
we've studied,
or will study, in our course.

00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:28.616
And that point is important and
underlies the fact that we spent

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:33.479
a lot of time talking about the
complexity of the disease.

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:37.922
It's important because it helps
us to understand a great deal of

00:02:37.922 --> 00:02:38.910
the history.
 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.720
One point is that if we
understand that,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.571
we're in a position to
understand also why research on

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:54.063
malaria generated such intense
intellectual excitement in the

00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:54.979
1890s.
 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:59.772
It was then that malariology
because the centerpiece for the

00:02:59.772 --> 00:03:03.508
new medical discipline of
tropical medicine.

00:03:03.508 --> 00:03:08.829
Here was one of the world's
oldest and most important public

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.796
health problems,
and suddenly it was yielding

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:14.240
its secrets.
 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.805
There was a tremendous
excitement intellectually,

00:03:18.805 --> 00:03:23.750
and malariology attracted some
of the world's leading

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.840
scientists and public health
officials.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.098
We also wanted to talk about
the complexity of malaria,

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:38.563
because a second reason is that
it helps us to understand why

00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:43.483
the public health strategies
that we've examined so far

00:03:43.483 --> 00:03:47.400
haven't worked in dealing with
malaria.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.389
If we think,
for example,

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.532
what are the main public health
strategies that we've discussed

00:03:54.532 --> 00:03:57.520
so far--one was plague measures.
 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.040
You know the drill by now:
sanitary cordons,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.669
quarantines,
isolation.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.294
These, however,
prove to be powerless against a

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:12.787
disease that's borne by vectors
as efficient and mobile as

00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:15.310
Anopheles mosquitoes.
 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.766
In high malarial endemicity
areas, mosquitoes are infinitely

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:23.819
numerous and infinitely mobile.
 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.560
Plague measures would be no
help at all.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.446
We can understand also why
another form of public health

00:04:32.446 --> 00:04:33.690
was useless.
 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.819
The sanitary movement was
irrelevant.

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.769
Malaria is not like cholera.
 

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:46.050
It's not a disease of filth or
the bacteria that thrive in it.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.848
Places that are immaculately
clean can be lethally infested

00:04:50.848 --> 00:04:55.069
with mosquitoes and the
plasmodia that they bear.

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.788
Furthermore,
malaria is a disease of rural

00:04:58.788 --> 00:05:02.415
areas, primarily,
and urban cleanups were

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:06.860
therefore largely irrelevant in
combating it.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.769
So, a second strategy of public
health that we've confronted so

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:15.649
far was powerless in dealing
with this disease.

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:20.242
Another public health strategy
that we've examined was the

00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:24.492
strategy of vaccination,
and we've seen that pioneered

00:05:24.492 --> 00:05:28.315
by Edward Jenner,
and developed much more by

00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:29.740
Louis Pasteur.
 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.420
And this too,
thus far, has proved unavailing

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.079
with regard to malaria.
 

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:40.980
Let's think for a moment about
vaccines,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.624
and I'd like to argue that
they're effective primarily

00:05:44.624 --> 00:05:49.007
under certain conditions,
that they aren't universal

00:05:49.007 --> 00:05:51.560
panaceas for all diseases.
 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.197
They're helpful primarily,
first of all,

00:05:55.197 --> 00:06:00.887
in combating diseases against
which the body develops a robust

00:06:00.887 --> 00:06:02.939
acquired immunity.
 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:06.838
Smallpox is a perfect example.
 

00:06:06.838 --> 00:06:11.733
A patient who has once suffered
from smallpox,

00:06:11.733 --> 00:06:16.954
but then recovers,
is then immune for the rest of

00:06:16.954 --> 00:06:19.129
his or her life.
 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:24.293
And, so, the strategy for
vaccination is to produce

00:06:24.293 --> 00:06:29.973
artificially the same effective
immune response that was

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:35.240
generated by the naturally
occurring infection.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.346
The strategy then is to
reproduce what nature does on

00:06:40.346 --> 00:06:41.329
her own.
 

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:46.497
But in malaria,
the immune response of the body

00:06:46.497 --> 00:06:50.202
is limited,
and it takes multiple

00:06:50.202 --> 00:06:55.689
infections and recovery there
from to acquire a partial

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:59.478
immunity,
and that immunity even then is

00:06:59.478 --> 00:07:00.550
short-lived.
 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.470
It's partial and short-lived.
 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.661
If you have painfully acquired
an immunity from malaria and

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:11.689
then you move away from the
malarial area,

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:17.410
in a couple of years your
immunity fades away,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.901
and if you return to the
malaria area you're susceptible

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:23.290
all over again.
 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:28.723
So, this is one factor that
makes vaccine development so

00:07:28.723 --> 00:07:30.600
very complicated.
 

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.434
Another point about vaccine
development is that vaccines

00:07:36.434 --> 00:07:42.161
haven't so far been developed
against a pathogen with a

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:47.360
lifecycle as complex as that of
a plasmodium.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.425
In targeting a virus or
bacterium, a vaccine is always

00:07:53.425 --> 00:07:59.720
dealing quite simply with the
virus or the bacterium.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.427
But the point about studying
about--one of the points about

00:08:03.427 --> 00:08:07.264
investigating the lifecycle of
the plasmodium is that they're

00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:08.160
different.
 

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:13.519
They go through a series of
complicated life stages.

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:16.750
Sometimes they're sporozoites.
 

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.000
Sometimes they're merozoites.
 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.180
Sometimes they're gametocytes.
 

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.259
And the problem with a vaccine
is that in order to be viable,

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:32.000
it has to be effective against
all of those phases in the

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.710
lifecycle of the plasmodium.
 

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:40.774
And then also another feature,
as I said, is that malaria is

00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:43.139
not a single disease.
 

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:47.759
It's a family of four different
parasitic diseases,

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:51.212
and the vaccine has to be
effective against not simply

00:08:51.212 --> 00:08:54.914
one,
but against numerous,

00:08:54.914 --> 00:08:59.860
therefore, species of parasite.
 

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:05.179
Now, I don't want to argue that
therefore the development of a

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:08.668
vaccine against malaria is
impossible.

00:09:08.668 --> 00:09:12.470
In fact, as we're speaking,
scientists are hard at work

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.567
trying to develop such a
vaccine, and indeed,

00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:17.750
they have come up with one.
 

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:22.460
You read some rather silly
things in the press.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:28.153
The vaccine developers came up
with a vaccine in the last few

00:09:28.153 --> 00:09:32.519
years that's about
thirty-percent effective.

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:36.455
I remember reading in places
like the New York Times

00:09:36.455 --> 00:09:40.594
that malaria would therefore be
eradicated globally in five to

00:09:40.594 --> 00:09:41.678
seven years.
 

00:09:41.678 --> 00:09:44.590
This is a sort of rather silly
prediction,

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.678
and even the people--I know
because I've talked to them--

00:09:47.678 --> 00:09:52.491
who are developing the vaccine
have no such illusion about its

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:53.360
efficacy.
 

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.934
They're thrilled because it's
thirty-percent effective,

00:09:56.934 --> 00:10:00.710
but that means that it's
seventy-percent not effective.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.077
Well, in order to understand
the evolution of public health

00:10:05.077 --> 00:10:09.447
strategies against malaria and
the problem facing the world

00:10:09.447 --> 00:10:12.460
today in dealing with this
disease,

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.352
then we need to know that the
very complexity of malaria has

00:10:17.352 --> 00:10:22.330
led to a wide array of different
strategies to combat it,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:28.317
as well as to an ongoing debate
on which course is likely to be

00:10:28.317 --> 00:10:29.960
most effective.
 

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:34.490
And as yet there's no consensus
in the international health

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.629
community on the best and most
effective strategy,

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:42.178
despite the fact that since the
turn of the twentieth century,

00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:45.009
at the least,
malaria is a disease,

00:10:45.009 --> 00:10:48.539
paradoxically,
that has such extraordinary

00:10:48.539 --> 00:10:51.639
ravages on the global
population,

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:56.761
and yet, paradoxically,
it's a disease that's both

00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:59.690
treatable and preventable.
 

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.440
There is an amazing paradox.
 

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.730
This morning,
then, I want to talk about not

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.739
the effects,
the nature of the plasmodium,

00:11:09.739 --> 00:11:14.716
the nature of mosquitoes,
the lifecycle or symptomatology

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:18.475
of malaria,
but I'd like to look instead at

00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:22.028
the disease from the societal
point of view,

00:11:22.028 --> 00:11:27.432
and in particular on efforts to
development a successful

00:11:27.432 --> 00:11:29.788
antimalarial strategy.
 

00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:34.452
But developing a strategy or
thinking about the proper

00:11:34.452 --> 00:11:39.466
strategy against malaria is
easier if we think of a number

00:11:39.466 --> 00:11:44.570
of ways in which this disease
might be characterized,

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:49.360
the ways in which it has been
seen by leading scientists,

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.759
physician, and public health
officials who've dealt with it.

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:57.950
So, I'm wondering if we could
think of malaria--we might ask a

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:00.080
number of questions about it.
 

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.460
How should we describe this
disease?

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:11.567
Is it a disease of poverty,
and what's the evidence for

00:12:11.567 --> 00:12:12.360
that?
 

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.033
That would entail dealing
with--and in a particular way

00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:18.889
that might be different from
other ways.

00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:24.134
One of the leading world
malariologists in the early

00:12:24.134 --> 00:12:29.788
twentieth century defined
malaria as a house disease.

00:12:29.788 --> 00:12:33.241
In other words,
it's primarily defined by poor

00:12:33.241 --> 00:12:37.614
housing conditions in which
people are crowded in order to

00:12:37.614 --> 00:12:40.529
work in agricultural
occupations,

00:12:40.529 --> 00:12:45.029
and those houses are porous to
insects,

00:12:45.029 --> 00:12:47.558
and it's in the house that the
disease is transmitted,

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:52.480
and both mosquitoes and human
beings are infected.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.058
Or should we see it instead as
an occupational disease?

00:12:58.058 --> 00:13:02.706
We've talked about the
relationship of malaria to

00:13:02.706 --> 00:13:06.587
agriculture,
and it's quite clear that

00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:12.320
certain forms of agricultural
production create and generate

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.399
high risk for those who practice
them,

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:21.142
and malaria is contracted
overwhelmingly by people who

00:13:21.142 --> 00:13:24.899
work in fields under certain
conditions.

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:28.220
Another way of thinking about
it is,

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.465
in that case,
one way of attacking a malaria

00:13:31.465 --> 00:13:35.768
then would be to have occupation
improve the conditions of

00:13:35.768 --> 00:13:37.783
farming,
of agriculture,

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:41.090
to regulate rice fields and all
the rest of it.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.226
That would be what you would
do, perhaps, if you define it as

00:13:45.226 --> 00:13:47.019
an occupational disease.
 

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:51.364
Should we think of it instead
as an environmental disease,

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:55.633
that it's a disease that
flourishes where the environment

00:13:55.633 --> 00:13:57.308
has been degraded?
 

00:13:57.308 --> 00:13:59.458
Where there's been
deforestation,

00:13:59.458 --> 00:14:00.399
for example.
 

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:07.820
Where the hydrology of rivers
has been undermined.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:12.309
Where there's flooding of
places where there are swamps

00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:14.139
and impounded water.
 

00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:16.452
In that case,
the way of dealing with

00:14:16.452 --> 00:14:18.139
malaria,
you might think,

00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:21.190
might be to have land drainage,
reclamation,

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:26.235
environmental sanitation--
quite a different strategy for

00:14:26.235 --> 00:14:28.600
dealing with the disease.
 

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.340
What should we call this
particular disease?

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:38.658
Is it an endemic disease,
or is it an epidemic disease?

00:14:38.658 --> 00:14:42.961
And here I think that malaria
is one of those diseases that

00:14:42.961 --> 00:14:46.820
we're studying in our course
that's actually both.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:52.884
That is to say,
in a particular locality,

00:14:52.884 --> 00:14:56.980
it is an endemic disease.
 

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.799
For example,
if you were to go to the

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:04.500
tropical areas of Africa today,
malaria is present throughout

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.519
the year.
 

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:09.850
It's highly, even hyper endemic.
 

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:16.379
But it's also capable of being
an epidemic disease.

00:15:16.379 --> 00:15:18.178
First of all,
that's easiest to see,

00:15:18.178 --> 00:15:22.451
perhaps, it temperate zones
where malaria has also been

00:15:22.451 --> 00:15:26.144
prevalent,
because then it's seasonal and

00:15:26.144 --> 00:15:29.610
you have the winter when the
disease--

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:33.019
it's too cold for the
plasmodium to be transmitted,

00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:36.120
but you have an annual summer
epidemic.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:39.120
But in addition,
under certain conditions we

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.308
would say that the epidemic is
intensified in conditions,

00:15:43.308 --> 00:15:47.363
for example,
of years of exceptionally heavy

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.399
rainfall.
 

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:53.518
Or, say, in tropical Africa,
it becomes an epidemic disease

00:15:53.518 --> 00:15:57.490
when something happens to the
environment,

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:02.620
where there are complex
emergencies or famines that

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.830
cause people to move in large
numbers--

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:12.621
who lack immunity to move to
areas where the disease is

00:16:12.621 --> 00:16:13.908
prevalent.
 

00:16:13.908 --> 00:16:18.784
So, malaria can cause
extraordinarily intense

00:16:18.784 --> 00:16:24.769
epidemics against a background
of being also an endemic

00:16:24.769 --> 00:16:26.100
disease.
 

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:30.245
I would like to argue,
and I will be arguing that part

00:16:30.245 --> 00:16:34.004
of the complexity of malaria--
and if I were asked the

00:16:34.004 --> 00:16:36.950
question--although you may want
to disagree with me,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.413
because people are still
arguing about how one defines a

00:16:40.413 --> 00:16:42.678
malaria and how one deals with
it.

00:16:42.678 --> 00:16:46.940
But I'd like to suggest that
perhaps it's all of those.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.928
It's a disease of poverty.
 

00:16:48.928 --> 00:16:52.523
This is part of its complexity,
its biological,

00:16:52.523 --> 00:16:55.570
social, and environmental
complexity.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.759
It is a disease of poverty.
 

00:16:57.759 --> 00:17:00.139
It's also a house disease.
 

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:02.309
It's an occupational disease.
 

00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:04.099
It's an environmental disease.
 

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:05.608
It's an endemic disease.
 

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:09.078
And it's an epidemic disease as
well.

00:17:09.078 --> 00:17:14.894
Well, what are the kinds of
strategies that have been

00:17:14.894 --> 00:17:19.480
deployed against this dreadful
disease?

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:25.838
One was since we now know that
it's transmitted by vectors,

00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:29.272
Ronald Ross,
who was one of the people who

00:17:29.272 --> 00:17:35.407
won the Nobel Prize,
in fact for establishing that

00:17:35.407 --> 00:17:39.787
very idea,
developed very question the

00:17:39.787 --> 00:17:45.650
idea then if it's a disease
that's transmitted by vectors,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.964
perhaps the right course for
dealing with malaria is vector

00:17:49.964 --> 00:17:50.710
control.
 

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.469
Kill mosquitoes by
insecticides,

00:17:54.469 --> 00:18:00.288
or remove their breeding
grounds by environmental

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:05.122
sanitation,
by dealing with an unregulated

00:18:05.122 --> 00:18:09.978
hydrology of an area,
by land drainage,

00:18:09.978 --> 00:18:14.480
by removing uncovered water.
 

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.251
A different strategy would be
to deal with not the mosquito

00:18:20.251 --> 00:18:22.838
but with the plasmodium.
 

00:18:22.838 --> 00:18:26.679
And so there have been--and
here I've talked about the

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:32.833
Italian School of malariology,
and Giovanni Battista Grassi

00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:41.164
had the idea that you would be
able to eradicate malaria by the

00:18:41.164 --> 00:18:47.566
use of antiplasmodial--
that is, quinine--one the first

00:18:47.566 --> 00:18:49.910
effective magic bullets.
 

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:55.244
He thought the idea was that if
we know what causes malaria and

00:18:55.244 --> 00:18:58.858
there is an effective treatment
for it,

00:18:58.858 --> 00:19:02.073
if you can use it
prophylactically to prevent

00:19:02.073 --> 00:19:06.016
people from being infected for a
number of seasons in a

00:19:06.016 --> 00:19:10.604
particular geographical area,
or if you can destroy the

00:19:10.604 --> 00:19:15.318
plasmodia in the bloodstreams of
all of the sufferers,

00:19:15.318 --> 00:19:20.563
then you can prevent mosquitoes
from being infected for the

00:19:20.563 --> 00:19:22.098
following year.
 

00:19:22.098 --> 00:19:27.047
And if you do that for several
seasons, then you could break

00:19:27.047 --> 00:19:31.240
the cycle of transmission and
eradicate malaria.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.987
Both of the people who
discovered the mosquito theory

00:19:35.987 --> 00:19:41.098
of transmission very quickly
came to the idea of malarial

00:19:41.098 --> 00:19:42.558
eradication.
 

00:19:42.558 --> 00:19:47.086
Ross did so,
and Grassi immediately thought

00:19:47.086 --> 00:19:50.858
that malaria had what he
called--

00:19:50.858 --> 00:19:55.088
it was the "colossus with
feet of clay"--

00:19:55.088 --> 00:20:00.565
and that quinine would be the
instrument that would enable the

00:20:00.565 --> 00:20:02.720
world to eradicate it.
 

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.308
But if you think of it as a
disease of poverty,

00:20:06.308 --> 00:20:11.640
you might think instead--and a
disease of housing,

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.356
and an occupation disease--then
you might think of a different

00:20:16.356 --> 00:20:20.750
strategy of social uplift,
that what you need to do to

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:25.534
deal with malaria is to practice
social medicine to deal with

00:20:25.534 --> 00:20:30.471
poor diet,
poor wages, child labor--those

00:20:30.471 --> 00:20:38.115
whole series of complex factors
that create the substratum in

00:20:38.115 --> 00:20:41.298
which malaria thrives.
 

00:20:41.298 --> 00:20:46.373
And then there is another
strategy which is quite commonly

00:20:46.373 --> 00:20:47.529
thought of.
 

00:20:47.529 --> 00:20:52.019
It has not made much progress,
at least to date,

00:20:52.019 --> 00:20:55.710
though who knows,
maybe it will in the future,

00:20:55.710 --> 00:21:00.040
and that's the
Jenner/Pasteurian strategy of

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.480
hoping to develop an effective
antimalarial vaccine.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.066
So vaccine development is one
of the great hopes in the

00:21:10.066 --> 00:21:15.316
antimalarial struggle,
and enormous amounts of

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:23.880
resources are being invested in
antimalarial vaccine development

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.920
as we speak.
 

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.868
Well, I want to give an example
of a particular place.

00:21:29.868 --> 00:21:33.476
It's the one you're reading
about this week,

00:21:33.476 --> 00:21:38.338
which was the impact of malaria
on a particular country.

00:21:38.338 --> 00:21:42.538
And I've chosen Italy for
particular reasons.

00:21:42.538 --> 00:21:47.990
One is that Italy had a special
relationship to malaria.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:53.788
It was the only Western
European country where it wasn't

00:21:53.788 --> 00:21:58.638
a colonial issue,
but rather the most important

00:21:58.638 --> 00:22:02.328
domestic public health problem.
 

00:22:02.328 --> 00:22:09.515
It was also the international
center of malariology from about

00:22:09.515 --> 00:22:13.519
1900 until the Second World War.
 

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:16.836
In other words,
we've talked about the hegemony

00:22:16.836 --> 00:22:21.017
of powers in international
medicine in the early nineteenth

00:22:21.017 --> 00:22:24.910
century down the middle of the
nineteenth century.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:30.752
In the smaller domain of
malariology, Italy was the

00:22:30.752 --> 00:22:36.828
center of the action from 1900
until World War II.

00:22:36.828 --> 00:22:41.804
This is the place where people
went to be trained in

00:22:41.804 --> 00:22:43.170
malariology.
 

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:47.358
People traveled--physicians
from all over the world--

00:22:47.358 --> 00:22:52.200
to study with those people who
were called the Rome School,

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.180
or the Italian School of
malariology--

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.318
Giovanni Battista Grassi most
prominent.

00:22:58.318 --> 00:23:01.378
But other names were extremely
prominent also,

00:23:01.378 --> 00:23:04.301
like Angelo Celli,
and we could list a whole

00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:05.730
series of others.
 

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:10.836
And it was Italians primarily
who were responsible for

00:23:10.836 --> 00:23:14.500
unraveling the mysteries of
malaria.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.909
And finally,
Italy was a place that did

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:20.778
something quite extraordinary.
 

00:23:20.778 --> 00:23:27.746
It was the first place to have
a successful strategy of

00:23:27.746 --> 00:23:31.230
antimalarial campaigning.
 

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:36.362
In other words,
a campaign began in 1900 and

00:23:36.362 --> 00:23:42.328
was successful in a eradicating
malaria by 1962.

00:23:42.328 --> 00:23:48.896
The last indigenous case of
malaria in Italy was in Sicily

00:23:48.896 --> 00:23:50.048
in 1962.
 

00:23:50.048 --> 00:23:53.348
So, this means that Italy has
lessons,

00:23:53.348 --> 00:23:58.028
and there are not many places
where there have been campaigns

00:23:58.028 --> 00:24:02.003
that have succeeded
intentionally in eradicating the

00:24:02.003 --> 00:24:02.940
disease.
 

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:09.178
This leads to a message of
hope--what can be accomplished

00:24:09.178 --> 00:24:12.901
by doing it,
and it also means that I think

00:24:12.901 --> 00:24:17.140
it's useful to look at the this
successful campaign in order to

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.243
draw lessons from it,
but to beware also of the

00:24:21.243 --> 00:24:25.289
misuse of history,
because a lot of what I think

00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:29.108
are the wrong lessons have also
been drawn from it.

00:24:29.108 --> 00:24:32.093
Well, in any case,
let's look just very,

00:24:32.093 --> 00:24:35.230
very quickly at the Italian
experience.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.785
As you know,
Italy was united in the middle

00:24:37.785 --> 00:24:41.994
of the nineteenth century,
and by the 1880s the new

00:24:41.994 --> 00:24:48.008
liberal regime became aware of
the prevalence of the disease

00:24:48.008 --> 00:24:52.565
throughout the country,
and this is the map that

00:24:52.565 --> 00:24:56.926
was--it's not the best map
artistically or even in terms of

00:24:56.926 --> 00:25:00.468
clarity,
or I would even say in terms of

00:25:00.468 --> 00:25:02.924
accuracy;
and, so, you're wondering why

00:25:02.924 --> 00:25:06.026
do I show you this map of
malaria in Italy when there are

00:25:06.026 --> 00:25:09.568
actually better maps that are
more colorful and all the rest?

00:25:09.568 --> 00:25:13.170
But for historians,
this is the important one,

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:17.900
because this is the one that
shook Italians up and convinced

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.308
them of the enormity of the
problem in their country.

00:25:22.308 --> 00:25:26.126
One of the things that's quite
clear, even in looking at this

00:25:26.126 --> 00:25:29.690
map, is that malaria was present
everywhere virtually.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:33.153
There are areas that are
yellow, pink,

00:25:33.153 --> 00:25:38.490
and red of prominence or
extreme prominence of malaria.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:43.430
And it was the case also that
after unification,

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:46.489
instead of the
problem--unification seen as a

00:25:46.489 --> 00:25:50.452
foundational moment for this new
regime that's supposed to

00:25:50.452 --> 00:25:53.869
deliver civilization,
economic betterment,

00:25:53.869 --> 00:25:56.690
progress, and also public
health--

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.104
but instead,
the years at the end of the

00:26:00.104 --> 00:26:04.220
nineteenth century see the
malarial problem,

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.710
already intense, getting worse.
 

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:12.818
Worse because of things like
deforestation of the Apennines.

00:26:12.818 --> 00:26:18.578
The railroad era actually had a
devastating impact,

00:26:18.578 --> 00:26:22.673
because it led to the demand
for trees to make the railroad

00:26:22.673 --> 00:26:25.640
ties and the stations and all
the rest,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.660
and therefore led to massive
deforestation and deregulation

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:34.470
of the hydrology of the entire
peninsula,

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:37.880
which was turned topsy-turvy.
 

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:44.035
It was also a time then of
economic difficulties and

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:49.465
crises, and malaria feeds on
human misfortune,

00:26:49.465 --> 00:26:55.380
and it did so in the late
nineteenth century.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.118
Well, in any case,
Italy also provided--

00:26:58.118 --> 00:27:01.180
we've talked about malaria as a
housing disease--

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.798
I thought I'd just show you a
representative type of peasant

00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:09.644
housing,
even down through the 1930s and

00:27:09.644 --> 00:27:11.925
'40s,
and when you live in places

00:27:11.925 --> 00:27:13.948
like this,
in a malarial area,

00:27:13.948 --> 00:27:17.460
you're highly vulnerable
because this is almost like

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.700
being outdoors.
 

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:22.130
In fact, it's probably worse in
terms of mosquitoes.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:27.150
It's entirely vulnerable and
open to flying insects,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:31.505
and having numerous people
sleeping in conditions like this

00:27:31.505 --> 00:27:35.108
helps to promote the disease and
transmission.

00:27:35.108 --> 00:27:40.509
Similarly, we talked about it
being an occupational disease.

00:27:40.509 --> 00:27:45.240
It wasn't by chance that Italy
is also a place of rice fields,

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.588
and rice fields are actually
wonderful places for mosquitoes,

00:27:49.588 --> 00:27:53.499
and the rice workers were among
those people who were most

00:27:53.499 --> 00:27:57.608
vulnerable,
and became symbolic as the

00:27:57.608 --> 00:28:00.759
victims of the plasmodia.
 

00:28:00.759 --> 00:28:05.242
So, in any case then,
there was an epidemic and

00:28:05.242 --> 00:28:08.068
endemic condition in Italy.
 

00:28:08.068 --> 00:28:12.712
And Italy showed all of those
terrible consequences of malaria

00:28:12.712 --> 00:28:17.278
that we've been talking about:
absenteeism in agriculture;

00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:22.095
waste--whole areas that weren't
cultivated because they were so

00:28:22.095 --> 00:28:26.910
dangerous, and those who did
work on them sickened and died;

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:31.440
an area of low productivity,
of illiteracy;

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.619
the underdevelopment of civil
society;

00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:39.509
low participation in politics;
mass emigration.

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:43.162
And I would argue indeed that
one of the features of Italy is

00:28:43.162 --> 00:28:45.779
that we've talked about North
and South,

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:50.358
and I talked about agriculture
being a determinant of malaria,

00:28:50.358 --> 00:28:54.941
and that the global North had
advanced forms of agriculture

00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:58.970
that were intensive and not
conducive to malaria;

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.710
and the South,
the global South,

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.390
had the opposite.
 

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:09.163
Well, this was reproduced in a
microcosm in Italy in that the

00:29:09.163 --> 00:29:14.358
North of Italy was much less
vulnerable to malaria,

00:29:14.358 --> 00:29:19.460
and the form of malaria was the
milder vivax malaria,

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:24.210
while the South of Italy was
riddled with malaria,

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:28.220
and it was malaria that
predominantly falciparum;

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:34.038
that is, the most devastating
and lethal form of the disease.

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:41.726
Well, there was a time of great
scientific discoveries that

00:29:41.726 --> 00:29:44.509
we've talked about.
 

00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:47.890
Oh, this is a famous picture,
just to show you.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:51.010
This is a painting called
"Malaria,"

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.220
and as you see,
it's sort of like a

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.138
piet�,
or a deposition from the cross,

00:29:56.138 --> 00:29:59.192
and I think it conveys,
in a moving,

00:29:59.192 --> 00:30:04.067
emotional way,
the reaction of a society to

00:30:04.067 --> 00:30:07.900
intense malarial transmission.
 

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:12.978
This is the prime minister at
the turn of the century until

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:17.093
the First World War,
under whom the antimalarial

00:30:17.093 --> 00:30:19.368
campaign gets started.
 

00:30:19.368 --> 00:30:22.068
And this is Giovanni Battista
Grassi--

00:30:22.068 --> 00:30:25.971
I tried to show him last
time--who was the person who

00:30:25.971 --> 00:30:30.098
proves the mosquito transmission
among human beings,

00:30:30.098 --> 00:30:35.068
the leading representative of
the Rome School of malariology,

00:30:35.068 --> 00:30:38.838
and his work was--we've talked
about institutions--

00:30:38.838 --> 00:30:41.410
this is the Santo Spirito
Hospital,

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:44.800
where he conducted his
research, because there were an

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.664
enormous,
almost unending supply,

00:30:47.664 --> 00:30:49.670
of malarial patients.
 

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:53.753
And it was here that he first
successfully infected human

00:30:53.753 --> 00:30:57.108
beings with malaria with a
number of scientific

00:30:57.108 --> 00:31:00.076
experiments,
that you might consider

00:31:00.076 --> 00:31:03.076
ethically problematic,
but in any case,

00:31:03.076 --> 00:31:07.189
there weren't rules about such
things at the turn of the

00:31:07.189 --> 00:31:08.759
twentieth century.
 

00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:13.771
Well, the pillars of the
eradication program--the pillar

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:17.598
of it was initially going to be
quinine.

00:31:17.598 --> 00:31:23.156
And so Italy passed a series of
quinine laws from 1900 to 1907,

00:31:23.156 --> 00:31:27.368
with support from the liberal
prime minister.

00:31:27.368 --> 00:31:31.077
And the idea was that you could
kill the plasmodia,

00:31:31.077 --> 00:31:33.375
break the cycle of
transmission,

00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:35.598
and eradicate the disease.
 

00:31:35.598 --> 00:31:39.279
Grassi thought it would be
merely a matter of a few years.

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:45.405
In fact, it then turned out to
be impossible to eradicate the

00:31:45.405 --> 00:31:51.327
disease so easily that people
were not used to contact with

00:31:51.327 --> 00:31:52.858
physicians.
 

00:31:52.858 --> 00:31:56.259
There wasn't access,
in other words,

00:31:56.259 --> 00:31:58.009
to medical care.
 

00:31:58.009 --> 00:32:01.528
Distributing quinine was
tremendously problematic.

00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:05.852
It also has to be followed
according to a very complex

00:32:05.852 --> 00:32:08.549
regimen,
and it has to be followed for

00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:11.720
months at a time,
and you can't get people to do

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.440
that unless they understand the
disease.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.788
And, so, actually to have an
effective antimalarial program,

00:32:18.788 --> 00:32:22.950
turned out you have also to
deal with poverty and with

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.573
illiteracy,
which are the allies of the

00:32:26.573 --> 00:32:28.910
mosquito and of malaria.
 

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:33.913
And so it was important to
teach people the discipline of

00:32:33.913 --> 00:32:38.025
quinine and the reasons for it
so very quickly,

00:32:38.025 --> 00:32:41.690
and also health access was
important.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:47.723
And, so, new parts of the
program turned out to be rural

00:32:47.723 --> 00:32:49.700
health stations.
 

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:55.619
It's expanding now beyond
quinine to include rural health

00:32:55.619 --> 00:32:59.848
stations, education and rural
schools.

00:32:59.848 --> 00:33:03.535
In other words,
a whole panoply of things that

00:33:03.535 --> 00:33:07.630
we might call social medicine,
improved housing.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:12.189
Actually, Celli argues that
trade unions were a powerful

00:33:12.189 --> 00:33:17.328
antimalarial tool because they
helped deliver better wages,

00:33:17.328 --> 00:33:20.096
and with that,
better diet and better

00:33:20.096 --> 00:33:23.211
clothing,
and child labor laws--and we

00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:27.049
know that children are
particularly susceptible to

00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:29.471
malaria--
and the regulation of

00:33:29.471 --> 00:33:32.789
occupations that were
particularly dangerous,

00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:36.118
such as working in rice fields.
 

00:33:36.118 --> 00:33:38.170
Well, the results of the
liberal program,

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:43.259
which has expanded well beyond
distributing quinine--

00:33:43.259 --> 00:33:46.611
in other words,
it starts with the vision of a

00:33:46.611 --> 00:33:50.782
magic bullet and moves very
quickly to a whole panoply of

00:33:50.782 --> 00:33:53.862
things that we might,
for shorthand,

00:33:53.862 --> 00:33:57.778
call social uplift,
with having to do with access

00:33:57.778 --> 00:34:00.969
to medical care,
improved housing,

00:34:00.969 --> 00:34:03.630
civil liberties,
education,

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:07.048
and all of those sorts of
measures.

00:34:07.048 --> 00:34:09.059
The results of the liberal
program,

00:34:09.059 --> 00:34:12.943
by the eve of the First World
War, were a massive decline in

00:34:12.943 --> 00:34:16.338
mortality,
at least, but still the

00:34:16.338 --> 00:34:19.429
persistence of the disease.
 

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:24.030
And then comes World War I,
which was an extraordinary

00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:25.940
setback for malaria.
 

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:31.007
And I've talked about the way
that malaria is a disease that

00:34:31.007 --> 00:34:37.088
thrives on human misfortune,
and there is no misfortune that

00:34:37.088 --> 00:34:40.619
is better for malaria than war.
 

00:34:40.619 --> 00:34:46.045
I thought I would show you a
few paintings of the First World

00:34:46.045 --> 00:34:51.110
War to show you the kinds of
conditions that led in Italy

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.172
that destroyed,
almost, the first fifteen,

00:34:55.172 --> 00:34:58.639
sixteen years of antimalarial
efforts,

00:34:58.639 --> 00:35:04.099
and created this huge explosion
of epidemic malaria during the

00:35:04.099 --> 00:35:05.710
First World War.
 

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:10.690
And this is a famous
painter--Sartorio is his name--

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.750
who was a combatant in the
First World War,

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.978
but then was wounded,
and returned to the front as a

00:35:17.978 --> 00:35:21.331
painter--
rather, as a photographer--and

00:35:21.331 --> 00:35:25.565
he took photographs of the
conditions at the fighting

00:35:25.565 --> 00:35:28.932
front,
and then he did paintings from

00:35:28.932 --> 00:35:30.380
his photographs.
 

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:33.547
And these are some of the most
impressive, I think,

00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:36.400
moving pictures of the sorts of
conditions.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:40.351
You can see exactly how
mosquitoes would thrive in

00:35:40.351 --> 00:35:42.449
conditions of this sort.
 

00:35:42.449 --> 00:35:44.679
This is not dead soldiers.
 

00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:48.070
These are soldiers bivouacking
after a battle,

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:51.864
and I think you can imagine
them being from non-malarial

00:35:51.864 --> 00:35:56.563
areas and not having resistance,
and you can see that they are a

00:35:56.563 --> 00:36:00.250
wonderful feast for
Anopheles mosquitoes,

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:04.161
and the soldiers from
non-malarial areas fell sick and

00:36:04.161 --> 00:36:06.230
died in enormous measures.
 

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:10.469
We've talked about malaria as a
housing disease.

00:36:10.469 --> 00:36:14.876
Well, also the destruction of
housing renders people

00:36:14.876 --> 00:36:18.050
vulnerable;
if you have to move into tents

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.579
or into the open fields to
bivouac,

00:36:20.579 --> 00:36:24.855
to move from area to area,
from cities to the rural areas

00:36:24.855 --> 00:36:28.905
and all the rest of it,
you become extraordinarily

00:36:28.905 --> 00:36:29.860
vulnerable.
 

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.561
And, so, the destruction of
housing and the housing stock

00:36:33.561 --> 00:36:35.280
was extremely important.
 

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.003
So, there was this tremendous
upsurge of malaria during the

00:36:40.003 --> 00:36:41.469
First World War.
 

00:36:41.469 --> 00:36:46.815
After the First World War,
in 1922, we have a new regime,

00:36:46.815 --> 00:36:51.969
and this was the fascist regime
of Benito Mussolini.

00:36:51.969 --> 00:36:55.608
We won't talk about the
conditions that brought

00:36:55.608 --> 00:36:59.851
Mussolini to power,
but we now have a totalitarian,

00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:03.606
one-party dictatorship--
the end of elections,

00:37:03.606 --> 00:37:08.226
police repression,
violence, the secret police,

00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:13.842
and a foreign policy of
expansion to restore an empire

00:37:13.842 --> 00:37:19.460
and to pursue broad European and
African conquest.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:25.070
By the end of the 1920s,
Mussolini is fully in power,

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:28.864
and he institutes some
antimalarial measures that

00:37:28.864 --> 00:37:32.693
became extremely famous,
and he's often thought as a

00:37:32.693 --> 00:37:36.143
hero of the antimalarial
movement because of what he did

00:37:36.143 --> 00:37:39.322
in this area--
the Pontine Marshes--which is

00:37:39.322 --> 00:37:42.505
just outside of Rome,
and you'll be reading about

00:37:42.505 --> 00:37:42.840
that.
 

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.643
This was done,
however, for political purposes

00:37:46.643 --> 00:37:51.094
more than for medical ones,
because the point about the

00:37:51.094 --> 00:37:55.492
Pontine Marshes was that only a
couple of thousand people lived

00:37:55.492 --> 00:37:59.159
there in 1930,
and this became the height of

00:37:59.159 --> 00:38:02.210
the regime's antimalarial
measures,

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:07.780
which were to drain the swamps,
to build new housing,

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.130
and to settle the land.
 

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:14.257
But it doesn't actually
confront malaria in the parts of

00:38:14.257 --> 00:38:18.458
Italy where the most numerous
people were getting ill and

00:38:18.458 --> 00:38:19.210
dying.
 

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:25.050
It was an enormous propaganda
effort to demonstrate,

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.047
more than health,
the power of the regime:

00:38:28.047 --> 00:38:32.289
that Mussolini could succeed
where liberals had failed,

00:38:32.289 --> 00:38:34.050
where the popes had failed.
 

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:39.793
The sorts of measures that were
undertaken, this is the kinds of

00:38:39.793 --> 00:38:44.260
conditions that he found--the
swamp conditions.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.775
I guess I'm overdoing it,
but I'm showing you there was

00:38:46.775 --> 00:38:49.340
plenty of water and there were
plenty of mosquitoes,

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:54.021
and it was estimated that you
had an eighty percent chance of

00:38:54.021 --> 00:38:58.860
contracting malaria if you spent
a single night in this area in

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.737
the summer,
before the drainage of the

00:39:01.737 --> 00:39:02.239
swamps.
 

00:39:02.239 --> 00:39:07.204
Well, this is the construction
of something modestly called the

00:39:07.204 --> 00:39:10.567
Mussolini Canal,
and we'll see also it went

00:39:10.567 --> 00:39:13.449
pumping stations,
land drainage;

00:39:13.449 --> 00:39:15.849
you see canals being
constructed;

00:39:15.849 --> 00:39:20.864
water being raised to be
harmlessly diverted to the sea

00:39:20.864 --> 00:39:24.235
went with it as well;
the distribution of

00:39:24.235 --> 00:39:27.360
quinine--I'm showing quinine
being distributed;

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.168
education and literacy,
and the teaching about the

00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:34.820
mosquito theory of
transmission--all of that was

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:35.909
important.
 

00:39:35.909 --> 00:39:40.382
We see fascist Boy Scouts
learning about larvae and their

00:39:40.382 --> 00:39:44.534
collection, and taking that
information home to their

00:39:44.534 --> 00:39:47.329
families, was part of the idea.
 

00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:49.739
Here they're doing the same
thing.

00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:51.829
There were sanatoria.
 

00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:55.500
And you see the improved
housing.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:57.018
These are sturdy houses.
 

00:39:57.018 --> 00:40:00.159
They have screened windows and
all the rest of it.

00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:02.090
You see screens going up.
 

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:06.670
So, this was really a huge,
huge project.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:12.135
It also included things that
weren't so--the building of new

00:40:12.135 --> 00:40:12.969
cities.
 

00:40:12.969 --> 00:40:16.686
Suddenly an area that was a
swamp, you see modern cities

00:40:16.686 --> 00:40:17.429
going up.
 

00:40:17.429 --> 00:40:20.199
The display of power is
enormous.

00:40:20.199 --> 00:40:26.126
This was really an idea that
had as much to do with the power

00:40:26.126 --> 00:40:29.880
of the regime as with public
health.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.706
I'm not saying that it's my
view that fascism is in fact bad

00:40:33.706 --> 00:40:36.429
for your health rather than good
for it.

00:40:36.429 --> 00:40:40.925
Here are some of the propaganda
pictures of the first peasant of

00:40:40.925 --> 00:40:43.992
Italy here, among his smiling,
happy crowds,

00:40:43.992 --> 00:40:45.920
and all the rest of it.
 

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.420
So, this was used in that way.
 

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:53.188
Well then, part of fascism,
however, you can't understand

00:40:53.188 --> 00:40:57.360
it without its impetus to
expansion and to war.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:02.643
And the Second World War,
again, led to a major

00:41:02.643 --> 00:41:09.251
destruction and to devastation,
repeating even a worse scale

00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:13.690
what had happened during the
First World War.

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.300
So, I won't talk about that.
 

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:20.793
I won't talk either this
morning about a war crime that I

00:41:20.793 --> 00:41:25.405
do discuss in the book,
that will see the use of

00:41:25.405 --> 00:41:29.820
malaria as an instrument of
bioterrorism.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:34.664
But my theme this morning is
what are the tools for dealing

00:41:34.664 --> 00:41:38.007
with malaria,
and the lessons that can be

00:41:38.007 --> 00:41:39.010
learned.
 

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:42.822
And, so, I'd like to look
then--with the downfall of

00:41:42.822 --> 00:41:47.085
fascism and another terrible
upsurge of malaria during the

00:41:47.085 --> 00:41:51.449
Second World War,
there is a campaign to

00:41:51.449 --> 00:41:57.510
eradicate malaria that gets
underway 1945-1946,

00:41:57.510 --> 00:42:00.739
and succeeds by 1962.
 

00:42:00.739 --> 00:42:04.559
And it's done with Allied
cooperation,

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:10.375
the leadership of the
Rockefeller Foundation and money

00:42:10.375 --> 00:42:15.630
from this country,
and it involves the idea of a

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:20.110
powerful new weapon to destroy
mosquitoes--

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:22.000
a technological weapon.
 

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.065
DDT was discovered during the
war and is now used as an

00:42:28.065 --> 00:42:34.469
instrument, a powerful
insecticide, to destroy malaria.

00:42:34.469 --> 00:42:40.032
And this is thought,
in fact, to be--and becomes--a

00:42:40.032 --> 00:42:42.480
premise, if we like.
 

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:48.577
The lesson is drawn that
malaria was eradicated in Italy

00:42:48.577 --> 00:42:54.056
after the use of DDT,
and so DDT is thought to be the

00:42:54.056 --> 00:42:57.510
cause of the destruction of
malaria,

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:59.518
the successful campaign.
 

00:42:59.518 --> 00:43:04.360
And this becomes the premise
for an international campaign,

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.539
a global campaign,
of the World Health

00:43:08.539 --> 00:43:14.867
Organization from 1955 until
1969 to use DDT worldwide to

00:43:14.867 --> 00:43:18.369
eradicate malaria globally.
 

00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:22.195
I want to argue that this is in
fact misleading,

00:43:22.195 --> 00:43:26.835
because the wrong lessons were
drawn from what happened in

00:43:26.835 --> 00:43:27.650
Italy.
 

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:31.742
In actual fact,
the eradication after World War

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:37.079
II was possible in part because
it marked not only the use of

00:43:37.079 --> 00:43:40.215
DDT,
but it also meant a massive

00:43:40.215 --> 00:43:44.110
investment of American aid to
provide food,

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:47.670
clothing, housing and
employment, that becomes,

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:51.719
first, UNRA,
and then the Marshall Aid Plan.

00:43:51.719 --> 00:43:56.423
And so there is an enormous
campaign to improve housing and

00:43:56.423 --> 00:43:58.289
conditions of people.
 

00:43:58.289 --> 00:44:01.378
In other words,
there's a massive social

00:44:01.378 --> 00:44:05.260
uplift, if we like,
that's going along at the same

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.400
time as the use of DDT.
 

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:10.893
At the same time,
you have the reestablishment of

00:44:10.893 --> 00:44:14.460
healthcare services and rural
health stations,

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:20.059
and the massive distribution of
quinine and artificial quinines

00:44:20.059 --> 00:44:24.829
developed during the war--
Atabrine and chloroquine.

00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:30.382
So, it's not a simple,
unidimensional program that

00:44:30.382 --> 00:44:31.630
succeeds.
 

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:37.530
By 1962, Italy becomes
malaria-free,

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.324
and I think that's one of the
factors that led to the

00:44:41.324 --> 00:44:44.170
possibility of the economic
miracle,

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:47.789
and Italy's becoming after,
by our day,

00:44:47.789 --> 00:44:50.268
the world's seventh industrial
power.

00:44:50.268 --> 00:44:55.159
So, there's an amazing measure
of hope of what can be done.

00:44:55.159 --> 00:45:01.248
When you eradicate malaria,
you unleash productivity and

00:45:01.248 --> 00:45:02.800
development.
 

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.385
But in addition,
this example then becomes the

00:45:07.385 --> 00:45:13.396
basis of the post World War II
program of global eradication

00:45:13.396 --> 00:45:19.001
that believed that it would be
possible simply to have a

00:45:19.001 --> 00:45:22.971
panacea,
a technological intervention

00:45:22.971 --> 00:45:26.835
with DDT,
and this is an experiment that

00:45:26.835 --> 00:45:32.065
by 1969 collapses in failure,
and I would like to argue that

00:45:32.065 --> 00:45:36.217
this ought to lead us to
enormous questions about today's

00:45:36.217 --> 00:45:40.518
antimalarial program of the
World Health Organization,

00:45:40.518 --> 00:45:44.635
Roll Back Malaria,
and very often it's thought

00:45:44.635 --> 00:45:50.126
that the development of using
some sort of magic bullet would

00:45:50.126 --> 00:45:51.590
be adequate.
 

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:55.233
I want to argue that this was
partly based on a

00:45:55.233 --> 00:45:58.559
misunderstanding of the Italian
lesson,

00:45:58.559 --> 00:46:01.659
and I think we're dealing with,
in our own world,

00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:04.429
the consequences of that in the
form,

00:46:04.429 --> 00:46:10.581
now, of either DDT- or
insecticide-treated bed nets as

00:46:10.581 --> 00:46:14.760
being the most useful
instruments;

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:20.367
and I think the campaign is
having enormous difficulties,

00:46:20.367 --> 00:46:25.574
and I think we need to think
about how we define this

00:46:25.574 --> 00:46:31.369
disease--what is its substratum;
what conditions promote it;

00:46:31.369 --> 00:46:36.929
and what kinds of strategies
are effective in combating it.

00:46:36.929 --> 00:46:38.500
So, thank you.
 

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:44.000

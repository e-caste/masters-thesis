00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.584
Prof: Today I want to
talk about the relationship

00:00:03.584 --> 00:00:04.440
between risk and law.
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.397
And I want to do this in the
context of the history of

00:00:08.397 --> 00:00:12.653
agriculture and regulating
pesticides during the twentieth

00:00:12.653 --> 00:00:13.550
century.
 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.580
And also I want to have you
consider the idea of risk.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.610
And I'm reminded as I think
about this of T.S.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.435
Eliot's line,
"Only those who will risk

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:29.110
going too far can possibly find
out how far one can go."

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.012
So many believe that
environmentalists are in the

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:37.809
business of trying to absolutely
minimize risk as opposed to

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.793
balance the threat of loss or
danger against other

00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:43.420
opportunities.
 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.137
And others argue that without
risk in life,

00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:49.970
things would be pretty boring.
 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.634
I was traveling through Europe
last summer on a lecture tour,

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.910
and I saw this village sitting
on the top of a cliff.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.732
And I wondered to myself about
the village, and I wondered how

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:08.239
they chose to build so close to
the edge, and what kind of

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:10.769
thinking was in their minds.
 

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.956
And I could imagine that this
used to be a number of fields

00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:17.700
where they grazed cattle and
sheep,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.150
and they probably worried about
losing cattle and sheep across

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.830
the cliff.
 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.549
Then as it grew into a little
village, I can imagine them

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.069
worried about their children
playing near the edge.

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.714
So much of environmental law is
about thinking about the buffer

00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:38.209
zone or the safety factor that
you would want to use to offer

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:42.180
sufficient protection against
significant damage.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.765
So the idea of risk and
understanding risk is really a

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:52.930
fundamental aspect of human
logic and instinct.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.991
Within law, it tends to become
defined as probability of loss,

00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:02.769
probability of damage.
 

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:06.061
It might be an endangered
species, it might be air

00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.479
quality, it could be human
health.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.030
And it's often expressed in
both quantitative and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.508
qualitative terms.
 

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:17.240
So particularly over the past
thirty years,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.866
the field of quantitative risk
assessment has grown in

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:25.110
importance to try to understand
what happens to chemicals or to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.301
species,
what kinds of pathways they

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:31.738
travel,
what kinds of problems might

00:02:31.738 --> 00:02:36.598
occur from chemical release and
chemical movement.

00:02:36.598 --> 00:02:39.730
And increasingly,
it's more sophisticated

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.365
mathematically,
and more difficult to

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:46.098
understand the different sources
of uncertainty that are embedded

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:47.848
in these estimates of risk.
 

00:02:47.848 --> 00:02:52.264
You may have heard of the idea
of an acceptable risk level for

00:02:52.264 --> 00:02:56.390
cancer or some other undesirable
outcome as being one in a

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.258
million.
 

00:02:57.258 --> 00:03:00.229
Well, the government has used
that standard on many occasions:

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.419
a "one-in-a-million excess
risk."

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.621
Well, to put that into
perspective, you might think

00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:07.348
about the H1N1 infection.
 

00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:14.387
So what was the actual
morbidity rate over the past

00:03:14.387 --> 00:03:16.639
year for H1N1?
 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.157
Well, it turns out that you
would first think about the

00:03:20.157 --> 00:03:24.133
number of people in the United
States, say roughly 300 million

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:24.848
people.
 

00:03:24.848 --> 00:03:29.024
And you'd want to know what the
incidence rate was in the

00:03:29.024 --> 00:03:29.770
illness.
 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.894
And those now,
I was looking at them last

00:03:31.894 --> 00:03:35.400
night on the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention website.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.001
Their estimate is that between
30 and 45 or 50 million people

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:46.229
carried the virus and had some
adverse effect from it.

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:50.440
And then I was looking at the
statistics for mortality.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.931
And between 15 and 20,000
people were killed by the

00:03:57.931 --> 00:03:59.430
illness.
 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.008
Why the uncertainty associated
with the estimate?

00:04:02.008 --> 00:04:05.471
Well, it's an illness that can
harvest, so to speak,

00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:08.593
in epidemiological terms,
the more susceptible,

00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:11.919
those that have serious
background illnesses.

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.459
So the expression of risk for
morbidity,

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.016
which means illness,
would be roughly let's say 30

00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:27.639
million out of 300 million,
which is really quite striking.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.319
There are few illnesses that
have that rate.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:34.420
So roughly a one-in-ten risk.
 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.742
And I mentioned when I started
this brief aside that a

00:04:37.742 --> 00:04:41.379
one-in-a-million risk is often
thought of as acceptable.

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:45.495
The distinction between
environmental risks that are not

00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:49.759
biologically based or generated
by pathogens like H1N1 and

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.649
chemical risks is often that
there was a clear causal

00:04:53.649 --> 00:04:57.839
relationship between exposure
and an understanding of the

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:02.416
source of the illness,
and also what might be done to

00:05:02.416 --> 00:05:06.040
manage it more effectively,
such as the vaccine.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.440
By the way, the vaccine that
was produced and distributed

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.199
this year was really pretty
remarkable.

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.293
It was extremely effective,
and the incidence rate was

00:05:13.293 --> 00:05:16.620
projected to be far higher than
it actually turned out.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.389
So this concern over
quantitative risk assessment,

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.160
try and understand who's most
vulnerable,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.423
who's going to basically
sustain the most serious

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:32.555
effects,
this preoccupies the

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:35.473
Environmental Protection Agency,
the Food and Drug

00:05:35.473 --> 00:05:38.613
Administration when they're
thinking about allowing a new

00:05:38.613 --> 00:05:40.800
drug to be added to the
marketplace.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.259
And really, the decision is all
about balancing,

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.899
trying to think through what
the quality of the evidence is

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:51.540
and should the dangers be
balanced against the benefits.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.190
And this standard for balancing
has shifted dramatically over

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.649
the twentieth century.
 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.934
So that the lecture today
really will trace the evolution

00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:05.141
of law and demonstrate how it's
shifted from 1906 to the

00:06:05.141 --> 00:06:06.060
present.
 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.572
And I want you to think about
how it really reflects changing

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:12.088
science as well as changing
human values.

00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:14.769
So that as the science gets
stronger,

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:18.863
we understand the relationship
between an exposure and an

00:06:18.863 --> 00:06:22.651
adverse outcome and oftentimes,
the government will intervene

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:24.540
by setting a new law or a new
regulation.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:32.327
So that back in 1906,
the Pure Food and Drug Act of

00:06:32.327 --> 00:06:40.427
1906 was passed after Upton
Sinclair published The

00:06:40.427 --> 00:06:44.331
Jungle,
that described filthy

00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:46.750
slaughtering conditions in
Chicago.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:51.629
The Pure Food and Drug Act was
passed in 1906 as well,

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.752
and it forbade foreign and
interstate commerce and

00:06:54.752 --> 00:06:58.129
adulterated or fraudulently
labeled food and drugs.

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.350
So products could now be seized
and condemned,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.689
and offending persons could be
fined or jailed,

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:06.259
and fresh, canned,
or frozen food shipped in

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:09.189
interstate commerce must be pure
and wholesome.

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.269
That was the new standard back
in 1906.

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:14.540
So basically,
the idea of adulteration and

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.610
the idea of fraudulent labeling
became important.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.452
So the very first attempts to
try to control risk in society

00:07:23.452 --> 00:07:28.543
related to food and agriculture
really concentrated on the idea

00:07:28.543 --> 00:07:31.786
of labeling,
the idea of making sure that

00:07:31.786 --> 00:07:35.680
the product inside the package
was what it claimed to be and

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:39.310
that it had an effectiveness
that was also claimed,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.990
and that it wasn't excessively
dangerous.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.533
They really worried about
farmers buying pesticides,

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:49.009
disposing pesticides,
and then basically having the

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.860
container filled with sugar or
flour.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.790
How would they know the
difference?

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.598
There were many cases of
fraudulent manufacturing

00:07:56.598 --> 00:08:00.341
practices early in the twentieth
century, before this law was put

00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:01.220
into place.
 

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.449
Another critical statute that
built on this was the

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:09.509
Insecticide Act of 1910 that
similarly prohibited

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:15.009
fraudulently labeled pesticides
and set standards for purity.

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:18.185
So the idea of ingredient
labeling was added to the

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:19.329
Insecticide Act.
 

00:08:19.329 --> 00:08:22.970
And it was designed to protect
farmers from dangerous and

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.399
impotent pesticides.
 

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:27.432
If you jump forward,
you find that the Federal Food,

00:08:27.432 --> 00:08:30.170
Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938
is important.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.807
And it became the home for
pesticide regulation for many

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:41.548
years until EPA took over that
responsibility in 1970.

00:08:41.548 --> 00:08:45.605
And the Food and Drug
Administration was authorized to

00:08:45.605 --> 00:08:49.048
set, in 1938,
limits for chemicals in food.

00:08:49.048 --> 00:08:53.219
So the recognition that if you
sprayed a field of corn and you

00:08:53.219 --> 00:08:57.456
harvested the corn and then you
sold it in the supermarket that

00:08:57.456 --> 00:09:01.505
it might still carry residues,
this was beginning to be well

00:09:01.505 --> 00:09:03.220
recognized back in the 1930s.
 

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:07.546
The criteria used to set the
tolerances was really quite

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:09.668
interesting at that time.
 

00:09:09.668 --> 00:09:11.558
It wasn't a health-based
criterion.

00:09:11.558 --> 00:09:14.610
It wasn't an
environmentally-based criterion.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.514
It was how much residue should
be allowed to remain on the food

00:09:19.514 --> 00:09:23.946
product if the chemical is
sprayed in the field at a dose

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:27.269
that's effective to get the job
done,

00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:28.879
in other words,
to kill the pest?

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:30.408
So that's kind of interesting.
 

00:09:30.408 --> 00:09:34.304
So it was really a standard
that was set to make sure that

00:09:34.304 --> 00:09:38.405
the residues would not cause the
food to be pulled out of the

00:09:38.405 --> 00:09:41.548
marketplace because they were
adulterated.

00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:44.950
So they were really designed to
protect the farmer and the

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.326
economic value of the crop,
rather than the health of the

00:09:48.326 --> 00:09:50.570
population or the environmental
quality.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:55.369
The Miller Amendment of 1954
required tolerances for all

00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:59.820
pesticides if they might remain
as food residues.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.240
And then the Delaney Amendment
in 1958 became infamous,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.414
because it set a zero risk
standard, a tolerance for

00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:10.379
carcinogens in food.
 

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:15.394
So the exact language is that
if a pesticide or other food

00:10:15.394 --> 00:10:20.940
additive is carcinogenic in
laboratory animals or in humans,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.399
and that was the first time in
law that using evidence from

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:27.503
laboratory animals was
considered to be sufficient in

00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:29.830
order to ban the use of a
chemical.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:34.130
Then it could not be used in a
way that would cause the residue

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.558
to be present in the food
supply.

00:10:36.558 --> 00:10:41.192
Now, you can imagine that these
chemicals were applied to many

00:10:41.192 --> 00:10:42.558
different crops.
 

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:47.033
And I mentioned to you that DDT
in my last lecture was applied

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:50.038
so heavily to so many different
foods,

00:10:50.038 --> 00:10:54.298
300 different food crops had
tolerances by the mid-1950s.

00:10:54.298 --> 00:10:58.398
But the government's ability to
detect these chemicals is really

00:10:58.398 --> 00:11:00.090
important to this story.
 

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.009
So if you use insensitive
detection technology,

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:07.104
in other words,
supposing that your chemical

00:11:07.104 --> 00:11:12.532
detection equipment is only
capable of finding residues at

00:11:12.532 --> 00:11:17.604
the part per 100,000 level,
ten to the minus fifth,

00:11:17.604 --> 00:11:20.418
or even part per million level.
 

00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:23.663
And the chemical is there,
but it's there at the high part

00:11:23.663 --> 00:11:26.477
per billion level,
the chemical test is going to

00:11:26.477 --> 00:11:28.817
come back negative,
it's going to come back as a

00:11:28.817 --> 00:11:29.320
non-detect.
 

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.409
So gradually,
you see this very interesting

00:11:32.409 --> 00:11:36.530
evolution in the concept of
purity and what constitutes a

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.577
safe and pure environment that's
very much driven by the

00:11:40.577 --> 00:11:43.889
sensitivity of the detection
equipment.

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:48.077
So during the century as the
detection equipment became more

00:11:48.077 --> 00:11:49.570
and more sensitive.
 

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.650
Now for some dioxins,
we can detect those down to the

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.370
part per quadrillion level.
 

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.328
And many chemicals are present
in food at the part per trillion

00:11:58.328 --> 00:11:58.840
level.
 

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.139
It's got people thinking about
well, what does that mean?

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:06.051
What does that mean to their
potential to influence human

00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:06.678
health?
 

00:12:06.678 --> 00:12:10.100
So back in the '40s and '50s,
the detection technology was

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.043
really quite limited,
and also the sampling was quite

00:12:13.043 --> 00:12:14.802
limited,
so that they really weren't

00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:16.028
sampling that many foods.
 

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:19.477
You can imagine the scale of
the problem this presents today,

00:12:19.477 --> 00:12:22.639
given the international
character of our food supply.

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:25.788
I ask this question with
respect to several commodities,

00:12:25.788 --> 00:12:29.605
first I started with apples and
wondered how many times the

00:12:29.605 --> 00:12:32.370
government tested apples for
pesticides.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.120
And then I looked at bananas.
 

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.740
And for bananas,
for a chemical that was,

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.450
when I looked about eight years
ago,

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.529
one of the most heavily used
insecticides on bananas grown in

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:46.023
the tropics,
the government was looking at

00:12:46.023 --> 00:12:50.458
about fifteen to eighteen
samples of bananas for this

00:12:50.458 --> 00:12:55.831
compound when I then was able to
calculate that several trillion

00:12:55.831 --> 00:13:00.778
individual bananas had been
imported into the nation during

00:13:00.778 --> 00:13:02.230
that year.
 

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.714
So one needs to think about
what standards are in place in

00:13:05.714 --> 00:13:09.621
different parts of the world,
where that food is likely to

00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:12.620
go, keeping records of import
statistics,

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.044
and then think about what kind
of a sampling design would be

00:13:16.044 --> 00:13:19.528
necessary in order to find these
residues in a way that might

00:13:19.528 --> 00:13:21.908
eventually lead to health
protection.

00:13:21.908 --> 00:13:25.428
So the Delaney Amendment was
really quite striking.

00:13:25.428 --> 00:13:30.456
It was adopted really with
great support in Congress,

00:13:30.456 --> 00:13:33.259
in part because of the U.S.
 

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:35.870
fascination with cancer and
also cancer management.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:40.009
So this grew in part because of
the nuclear weapons testing era,

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:43.740
but it is curious that within
the European nations,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.207
the regulatory approach to
environmental quality has not

00:13:47.207 --> 00:13:50.706
been as concerned with cancer,
it's been more concerned with

00:13:50.706 --> 00:13:53.200
neurological decline and also
reproductive health.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.851
So it raises really interesting
questions about why the

00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:58.259
preoccupation in the United
States with cancer.

00:13:58.259 --> 00:14:02.051
So the first seriously health
protective statute that we can

00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:05.970
find in environmental law has to
do with food and it has to do

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.735
with pesticides,
and it's contained in this

00:14:08.735 --> 00:14:09.769
Delaney Amendment.
 

00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:12.399
By the way, this amendment
applies to all food additives.

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:15.634
And a food additive could be
defined also as a coloring

00:14:15.634 --> 00:14:18.330
agent, like the salmon coloring
I spoke of.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.110
It could be defined as a
packaging material migrant.

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:26.330
It could be a flavoring agent
as well, so that the standard is

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.230
very clear.
 

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.831
If it induces cancer in animals
or in humans,

00:14:30.831 --> 00:14:32.879
then it is not allowed.
 

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:37.376
Curiously, there is a clause
within the statute that applies

00:14:37.376 --> 00:14:41.568
only to pesticides that are
defined as food additives if

00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:43.168
they concentrate.
 

00:14:43.168 --> 00:14:46.187
And you remember the story I
told you the other day about

00:14:46.187 --> 00:14:49.259
taking a grape and extracting
all the water out of it,

00:14:49.259 --> 00:14:52.808
or taking corn and extracting
the oil out of it,

00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:56.096
and having to be thoughtful
about what that really might

00:14:56.096 --> 00:14:57.830
mean for chemical residues.
 

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.207
So if you are concerned about
oil extraction,

00:15:01.207 --> 00:15:04.278
you need to think about
lipophilicity.

00:15:04.278 --> 00:15:07.932
So if you've got a chemical
such as a chlorinated carbon

00:15:07.932 --> 00:15:11.850
that is likely to bind onto fats
of one form or another,

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.541
extracting the oil out will
likely also concentrate the

00:15:15.541 --> 00:15:16.840
chemical residue.
 

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:19.658
So if you look in the code of
federal regulations,

00:15:19.658 --> 00:15:20.808
it's very curious.
 

00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:22.969
You can go over to the law
library and pull out the code of

00:15:22.969 --> 00:15:24.308
federal regulations on
pesticides.

00:15:24.308 --> 00:15:27.817
Actually, it would be a good
assignment for teaching fellows

00:15:27.817 --> 00:15:28.830
to disseminate.
 

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:34.312
Go look at the code of federal
regulations for pesticide

00:15:34.312 --> 00:15:38.202
residues in food,
and you'll see 40 CFR,

00:15:38.202 --> 00:15:39.000
135.
 

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.188
And you go to the appendix,
and the appendix is several

00:15:42.188 --> 00:15:45.908
hundred pages long of individual
pesticide-food combinations.

00:15:45.908 --> 00:15:50.029
So I was quite struck by his
several years ago.

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:52.835
And I added all of these up and
it turns out that there are

00:15:52.835 --> 00:15:55.399
about 10,000 different
pesticide-food combinations.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:16:00.875
And if you look carefully at
these combinations that set

00:16:00.875 --> 00:16:06.650
limits for benomyl in bananas or
let's say chlorpyriphos in

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:11.033
apples or DDT in milk,
that standard is still in place

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:11.690
by the way.
 

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.436
It's kind of interesting,
even though DDT was banned,

00:16:14.436 --> 00:16:16.548
as I said the other day,
in the 1970s.

00:16:16.548 --> 00:16:19.620
But if you look carefully,
you'll see that you get a

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.296
different residue limit allowed
for fresh corn or fresh apples

00:16:23.296 --> 00:16:26.908
or fresh soybeans than you do
for the processed product.

00:16:26.908 --> 00:16:29.879
And it's basically because of
this concentration factor.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:33.543
So water extraction,
making raisins out of grapes,

00:16:33.543 --> 00:16:37.803
making wine out of grapes,
or making oils out of different

00:16:37.803 --> 00:16:40.870
kinds of grains can have this
effect.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:45.994
The Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act

00:16:45.994 --> 00:16:50.453
of 1947 was the central statute
that was passed,

00:16:50.453 --> 00:16:54.629
and it really set the stage for
the U.S.

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:58.690
Department of Agriculture's
authority to issues licenses or

00:16:58.690 --> 00:16:59.808
registrations.
 

00:16:59.808 --> 00:17:03.140
So as I mentioned earlier,
the idea of registering a

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:06.930
pesticide or allowing it to be
used for a certain crop,

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:10.348
these registrations were given
out one after another after

00:17:10.348 --> 00:17:12.736
another,
decade after decade,

00:17:12.736 --> 00:17:16.201
so that by 1960,
there were 50,000 different

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:19.460
pesticide registrations that had
been issued.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.910
And by 1970,
there were nearly 70,000

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.680
pesticide registrations.
 

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.755
And a registration is given for
a specific chemical use,

00:17:26.755 --> 00:17:29.720
and it may be also assigned for
a specific package.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:36.890
So you may have chemical X,
and that has one registration.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:39.726
And then it may be sold also
with chemical Y or chemical Y

00:17:39.726 --> 00:17:42.612
and Z, and they would have
different registrations assigned

00:17:42.612 --> 00:17:43.058
them.
 

00:17:43.058 --> 00:17:46.078
And they might have different
registrations assigned for

00:17:46.078 --> 00:17:48.932
different kinds of uses,
so that these chemicals were

00:17:48.932 --> 00:17:51.019
not just used on food
commodities.

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:53.660
Where else might they be used?
 

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.500
Well, think about it.
 

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.616
Many of the buildings at Yale
are sprayed by pesticides

00:17:59.616 --> 00:18:00.380
indoors.
 

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.838
So that type of use often had
to have a separate registration.

00:18:03.838 --> 00:18:06.358
Sprayed in subways,
sprayed in vehicles,

00:18:06.358 --> 00:18:11.467
added to materials such as
plastics that are components of

00:18:11.467 --> 00:18:15.410
cars or that are components of
urethanes,

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.048
for example,
that coat the wood here.

00:18:17.048 --> 00:18:21.680
So that plastics have carried
biocides into our environment in

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.348
a whole set of ways.
 

00:18:23.348 --> 00:18:26.924
And the government had to keep
track of where these chemicals

00:18:26.924 --> 00:18:30.740
were going, and had to license
each of these distinctive uses.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.380
So the FIFRA of 1947 was
important because it defined

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:38.858
these chemicals as economic
poisons,

00:18:38.858 --> 00:18:40.950
implying yes,
they're poisonous,

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.132
but they also carry an economic
benefit so that we need to look

00:18:45.132 --> 00:18:48.640
at this using a utilitarian
balancing standard,

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.605
so that risk-benefit balancing
became the phrase that guided

00:18:53.605 --> 00:18:54.108
U.S.
 

00:18:54.108 --> 00:18:58.660
Department of Agriculture to
crank out these registrations.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:02.999
It also extended the
regulations, not just to

00:19:02.999 --> 00:19:06.353
insecticides,
but to herbicides and

00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:08.028
rodenticides.
 

00:19:08.028 --> 00:19:10.278
And right now,
in terms of volume of chemical

00:19:10.278 --> 00:19:12.990
released in the world,
you find the herbicides are the

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.778
most heavily type of pesticide.
 

00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:18.828
So there are pesticides,
there are insecticides,

00:19:18.828 --> 00:19:23.368
herbicides, rodenticides
designed to kill rats or mice,

00:19:23.368 --> 00:19:27.969
slimicides, that are applied to
kill slime and algae on the side

00:19:27.969 --> 00:19:30.890
of nuclear power plant cooling
towers.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:34.150
There are nearly a hundred
different chemicals.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.818
Any swimmers in the room?
 

00:19:35.818 --> 00:19:38.808
Probably a few,
or former swimmers?

00:19:38.808 --> 00:19:41.375
Well, there are nearly a
hundred different pesticides

00:19:41.375 --> 00:19:44.335
that have been registered for
use in swimming pools to kill a

00:19:44.335 --> 00:19:48.832
variety of viruses,
bacteria, as well as molds and

00:19:48.832 --> 00:19:50.710
other pathogens.
 

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.487
If you think about that
carefully and you think about

00:19:54.487 --> 00:19:58.263
the relative risk that is
associated with using those

00:19:58.263 --> 00:20:01.460
chemicals as opposed to not
using them,

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.130
it's probably a really good
choice,

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.390
given the illnesses that could
live in that environment.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:11.705
So that this statute was the
first to really break down these

00:20:11.705 --> 00:20:15.951
different categories of biocides
and really assign different

00:20:15.951 --> 00:20:18.108
regulatory responsibility.
 

00:20:18.108 --> 00:20:21.310
No authority was given to the
Department of Agriculture,

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:24.920
however, to remove hazardous
chemicals from the marketplace.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.939
So that they always found that
the benefits outweighed the

00:20:27.939 --> 00:20:28.308
risk.
 

00:20:28.308 --> 00:20:32.554
There are no instances that I
can point to that the Department

00:20:32.554 --> 00:20:36.798
of Agriculture either banned a
chemical or found that the risk

00:20:36.798 --> 00:20:38.190
was too serious.
 

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.338
They may have adjusted the
allowable use rates or the type

00:20:41.338 --> 00:20:44.710
of environment it could be
released to or the type of crop.

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:46.740
But no product bans.
 

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.190
And think about this.
 

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.457
The government gave,
the Congress gave the

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:53.387
Department of Agriculture the
authority to manage this

00:20:53.387 --> 00:20:55.490
program, to implement the
program.

00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:57.538
Now, is that a good idea?
 

00:20:57.538 --> 00:21:00.019
What's the Department of
Agriculture's basic role?

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:03.632
Well, it's really to promote
economic production of a variety

00:21:03.632 --> 00:21:06.038
of different agricultural
commodities.

00:21:06.038 --> 00:21:10.017
And they really also do not
have and have not had much

00:21:10.017 --> 00:21:14.369
expertise in environmental
science to know what happened to

00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:18.722
the chemicals once they were
released or to think carefully

00:21:18.722 --> 00:21:21.048
about the health effects.
 

00:21:21.048 --> 00:21:24.813
So the medical expertise within
the Department of Agriculture

00:21:24.813 --> 00:21:27.509
throughout their period of
jurisdiction,

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:30.471
which ended in 1970,
when the Environmental

00:21:30.471 --> 00:21:34.510
Protection Agency was formed,
was a period when they really

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.891
had very little expertise in
environmental science or in

00:21:37.891 --> 00:21:40.894
medical science,
which is really fundamental to

00:21:40.894 --> 00:21:44.086
the way that we're thinking
about regulating pesticides

00:21:44.086 --> 00:21:44.618
today.
 

00:21:44.618 --> 00:21:48.440
The FIFRA amendments in 1964
came after Rachel Carson's book,

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.511
Silent Spring,
raised the alarm and caused the

00:21:51.511 --> 00:21:54.880
population to be quite upset
about pesticide residues,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.160
particularly their effect on
wildlife,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.644
but also growing recognition
that these chemicals could build

00:22:01.644 --> 00:22:03.140
in the human body.
 

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:07.459
And also the Food and Drug
Administration's admission that

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:11.778
they had found pesticides in
human breast milk as early as

00:22:11.778 --> 00:22:12.460
1952.
 

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.930
The public wasn't warned about
this.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.880
And basically,
if you find a chemical,

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.662
regardless of what it is,
you find it in another species

00:22:24.662 --> 00:22:27.550
of mammal's breast milk,
you can presume that it's

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:29.450
likely to get into human breast
milk as well.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:32.694
So Rachel Carson's Silent
Spring turned out to be a

00:22:32.694 --> 00:22:35.400
real watershed,
not just legally for

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.686
pesticides, because it really
increased the sense of

00:22:39.686 --> 00:22:44.308
susceptibility to biocides or
the economic poisons,

00:22:44.308 --> 00:22:49.048
but it really met with quite a
bit of resistance in Congress.

00:22:49.048 --> 00:22:53.842
Again, this was the end of the
nuclear weapons testing era in

00:22:53.842 --> 00:22:55.200
the atmosphere.
 

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.721
And it was also a period of
great unrest in the United

00:22:58.721 --> 00:22:59.318
States.
 

00:22:59.318 --> 00:23:04.692
The origin of the Civil Rights
Movement may be traced to this

00:23:04.692 --> 00:23:05.500
period.
 

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.048
The Civil Rights Act of 1964,
recall that.

00:23:09.048 --> 00:23:12.027
Also, we were getting more
deeply embedded in the war in

00:23:12.027 --> 00:23:13.759
Vietnam at that point in time.
 

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:18.087
And environmentalism was
growing up, creeping up on the

00:23:18.087 --> 00:23:18.808
agenda.
 

00:23:18.808 --> 00:23:21.160
But it was really quite an
interesting period.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.430
Congress, however,
was preoccupied.

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:27.284
Other than making some minor
revisions to the statute that

00:23:27.284 --> 00:23:29.990
included adding these words:
caution,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.323
warning, and hazard,
depending upon the relative

00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:32.868
toxicity.
 

00:23:32.868 --> 00:23:35.928
This didn't really help very
much because of public confusion

00:23:35.928 --> 00:23:37.608
about what those phrases meant.
 

00:23:37.608 --> 00:23:40.788
And the Department of
Agriculture's secretary was

00:23:40.788 --> 00:23:44.230
given authority finally to
remove pesticides from the

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:48.269
market based upon a finding of
imminent hazard to public.

00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:51.748
Now, EPA was created in 1970,
and it was given the

00:23:51.748 --> 00:23:54.942
responsibility to manage
pesticides and it was

00:23:54.942 --> 00:23:57.568
consolidated from other
agencies.

00:23:57.568 --> 00:24:01.230
Some fifteen or sixteen
different subunits of different

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:05.298
agencies were pulled together to
create EPA back in 1970,

00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:07.318
including the Department of
Agriculture,

00:24:07.318 --> 00:24:10.077
that had formerly had the
pesticide management

00:24:10.077 --> 00:24:11.118
responsibility.
 

00:24:11.118 --> 00:24:16.453
So you can imagine entire
sub-bureaucracies picking up and

00:24:16.453 --> 00:24:19.450
moving their materials to EPA.
 

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.911
And the stories from some of
the early administrators about

00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:26.314
how they did this and what the
effect was are really quite

00:24:26.314 --> 00:24:27.088
striking.
 

00:24:27.088 --> 00:24:30.065
They described that the
Department of Agriculture had

00:24:30.065 --> 00:24:32.240
kept files on individual
chemicals,

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.009
but they were completely
disorganized,

00:24:34.009 --> 00:24:37.123
often just handwritten,
often with no environmental

00:24:37.123 --> 00:24:40.207
science data,
often no testing of chemical

00:24:40.207 --> 00:24:43.861
presence in different
commodities that it had been

00:24:43.861 --> 00:24:45.798
licensed to be used on.
 

00:24:45.798 --> 00:24:49.538
And some chemicals had no data
at all.

00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:54.086
So EPA was in this situation of
becoming immediately responsible

00:24:54.086 --> 00:24:57.480
for 70,000 different pesticide
registrations.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:01.040
The public was quite concerned
about these residues getting

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.603
into their bodies and into the
environment and the wildlife

00:25:04.603 --> 00:25:05.339
effects.
 

00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:07.098
So they felt a lot of heat.
 

00:25:07.098 --> 00:25:09.703
Increasingly,
environmental laws had these

00:25:09.703 --> 00:25:13.342
citizen suit provisions,
so EPA was getting sued in the

00:25:13.342 --> 00:25:16.266
early 1970s,
and they got sued on a variety

00:25:16.266 --> 00:25:19.048
of compounds,
such as DDT and aldrin and

00:25:19.048 --> 00:25:19.730
dieldrin.
 

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.990
And they were forced to go back
and look at the data that they

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.709
had available,
and they found that they really

00:25:25.709 --> 00:25:29.269
had very little data to justify
many of these registrations.

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:33.442
But the law was set up that
forced them to look at this

00:25:33.442 --> 00:25:35.838
problem a chemical at a time.
 

00:25:35.838 --> 00:25:38.328
So if you've got 70,000
different chemicals,

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:41.648
and the law requires that you
look at them one at a time and

00:25:41.648 --> 00:25:45.250
you've got a staff that doesn't
have the basic data in place,

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.525
this basically put the
regulatory process in deep

00:25:48.525 --> 00:25:49.140
freeze.
 

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:53.500
So how would you manage that if
you were responsible?

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:56.586
Well, Congress thought about
this, and they allocated more

00:25:56.586 --> 00:25:59.618
and more money to the
Environmental Protection Agency.

00:25:59.618 --> 00:26:02.311
And EPA became much more
aggressive and starting banning

00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:02.900
chemicals.
 

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.432
They banned DDT first and then
aldrin and then dieldrin,

00:26:06.432 --> 00:26:08.490
heptachlor and then chlordane.
 

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:10.558
All of these were the
chlorinated hydrocarbons.

00:26:10.558 --> 00:26:14.453
The FIFRA amendments of 1975
gave the Secretary of

00:26:14.453 --> 00:26:18.108
Agriculture authority to be
notified of pending

00:26:18.108 --> 00:26:21.720
cancellations,
which meant that he was given a

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:23.818
voice to oppose cancellations.
 

00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:27.676
But the Environmental
Protection Agency really became

00:26:27.676 --> 00:26:31.905
the stewards for human health
and environmental quality so

00:26:31.905 --> 00:26:35.170
that the Secretary of
Agriculture's voice was

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.470
diminishing in the 1970s.
 

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:41.097
Congress also recognized that
EPA's not making much progress

00:26:41.097 --> 00:26:44.420
on this sea of chemicals,
so they'd better do something

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.220
about it.
 

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.538
They mandated that each
chemical had to be reviewed

00:26:48.538 --> 00:26:50.529
within a nine-year deadline.
 

00:26:50.529 --> 00:26:53.990
Well, EPA was not able to
accomplish that,

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:57.663
so the '70s and the '80s and
'90s were all great examples of

00:26:57.663 --> 00:27:01.517
what I call the rule of twenty,
that each chemical might get

00:27:01.517 --> 00:27:03.690
some attention every twenty
years.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.240
But what does that mean?
 

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.740
You can think about the fact
that new chemicals are being

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.565
added to the marketplace,
new registrations are being

00:27:10.565 --> 00:27:13.314
issued,
the data are lousy and EPA is

00:27:13.314 --> 00:27:17.150
taking twenty years to review a
single chemical,

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.519
that doesn't make sense.
 

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:21.720
The science is evolving at a
lightening pace on where the

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.548
chemicals are in the environment
or what the health effects are,

00:27:25.548 --> 00:27:28.250
or what the effects on
different species are.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:33.365
And EPA is like this ship that
is frozen, it's icebound,

00:27:33.365 --> 00:27:38.480
unable to move with a speed
that it really needed to.

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.997
Well, this was recognized by
the National Academy of

00:27:40.997 --> 00:27:43.499
Sciences,
in two publications that I had

00:27:43.499 --> 00:27:46.868
a chance to work on,
one regulating pesticides and

00:27:46.868 --> 00:27:50.130
food that really critiqued the
Delaney paradox.

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:53.996
And a bunch of us thought that
the zero risk standard as it had

00:27:53.996 --> 00:27:57.863
been interpreted by the Food and
Drug Administration really did

00:27:57.863 --> 00:27:59.358
not make much sense.
 

00:27:59.358 --> 00:28:04.278
FDA had interpreted zero risk
to mean a little bit of risk.

00:28:04.278 --> 00:28:07.180
So de minimis is the
phrase that it used.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:11.769
And de minimis means a
trivial amount of risk.

00:28:11.769 --> 00:28:14.767
And they define that generally
as a one-in-a-million risk

00:28:14.767 --> 00:28:15.410
threshold.
 

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.777
So that this was a curious
experience for me,

00:28:19.777 --> 00:28:24.938
because it was my first
exploration of the human diet

00:28:24.938 --> 00:28:27.318
and its variability.
 

00:28:27.318 --> 00:28:31.700
So I started poring through
food intake surveys,

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.555
which is the reason that I
asked a section on Monday night

00:28:34.555 --> 00:28:37.009
to keep track of just one day of
your own diet.

00:28:37.009 --> 00:28:40.019
Think about that,
what foods do you eat,

00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:43.763
as a way of thinking about how
patterns in your diet might lead

00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:47.386
to predictable patterns of your
exposure to residues that had

00:28:47.386 --> 00:28:49.259
been allowed by government.
 

00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:52.465
So in this case,
we were looking only at that

00:28:52.465 --> 00:28:55.672
subset of chemicals that had
some evidence of

00:28:55.672 --> 00:28:57.130
carcinogenicity.
 

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:00.753
So that these chemicals induced
cancer in animals or were known

00:29:00.753 --> 00:29:02.450
to induce cancer in humans.
 

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.923
And we were thinking
particularly about how cancer

00:29:05.923 --> 00:29:08.828
risk might add up across the
chemicals.

00:29:08.828 --> 00:29:11.920
So a hundred different
chemicals that are cancer

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.404
inducing in laboratory
experiments, how would you deal

00:29:15.404 --> 00:29:17.970
with that issue of risk
additivity?

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:23.356
Would it be possible that there
may be a negative effect on risk

00:29:23.356 --> 00:29:27.890
if you had two chemical
exposures at the same time?

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.227
Well, scientists have found
some cases where that actually

00:29:31.227 --> 00:29:33.817
occurred,
where a lower risk chemical is

00:29:33.817 --> 00:29:37.529
able to bind onto a site in a
cell and prevent a higher risk

00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:39.920
chemical from doing the same
thing.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.030
In other cases,
there's a synergistic

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.589
relationship,
so that the risk is not just

00:29:45.589 --> 00:29:48.021
additive,
but if you're exposed to

00:29:48.021 --> 00:29:51.223
chemical A and then chemical B,
you've got a higher risk of

00:29:51.223 --> 00:29:51.980
getting cancer.
 

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.220
So working with a bunch of
specialists in cancer,

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.789
as well as specialists in
residue chemistry and exposure

00:29:59.789 --> 00:30:02.413
analysis,
we came up with a not too

00:30:02.413 --> 00:30:06.397
complimentary picture of the way
that EPA had regulated

00:30:06.397 --> 00:30:10.604
carcinogens in the food and
recommended also that they pay

00:30:10.604 --> 00:30:14.220
much more attention to the
individual diet,

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.683
that the diet was likely to be
the key route of exposure to a

00:30:18.683 --> 00:30:21.140
variety of different chemicals.
 

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:24.417
The second book flowed from the
first by the National Academy of

00:30:24.417 --> 00:30:27.384
Sciences, called Pesticides
in the Diets of Infants and

00:30:27.384 --> 00:30:28.269
Children.
 

00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:31.788
And this focused on a finding
inside the red book,

00:30:31.788 --> 00:30:35.366
the finding that there's a lot
of variability out there in the

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:38.298
diets that people eat that is
quite predictable.

00:30:38.298 --> 00:30:40.915
So if you're Italian,
you're likely to eat more

00:30:40.915 --> 00:30:41.940
tomato products.
 

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.540
If you're Latino,
you're likely to eat more corn

00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:45.150
products.
 

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:49.695
If you are an African American
from the southern part of the

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:52.702
United States,
people generally eat more

00:30:52.702 --> 00:30:53.548
greens.
 

00:30:53.548 --> 00:30:56.412
If you are living in
California, you're going to eat

00:30:56.412 --> 00:30:59.273
more fresh produce than you
would if you live in the

00:30:59.273 --> 00:31:00.058
Northeast.
 

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:04.608
Its cost does not go up the way
that it does in the Northeast.

00:31:04.608 --> 00:31:08.949
So diet varied by season,
it varied by region of the

00:31:08.949 --> 00:31:13.712
country, it varies by age,
and it also varies quite a bit

00:31:13.712 --> 00:31:15.160
by ethnicity.
 

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.295
So if you don't understand
these differences in dietary

00:31:17.295 --> 00:31:19.623
patterns,
you really don't have much hope

00:31:19.623 --> 00:31:23.151
of understanding the variability
in the chemical matrix that

00:31:23.151 --> 00:31:26.380
these individual diets might
convey into your body.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.530
So it also presents a really
kind of an interesting idea that

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:34.614
you could use cropping patterns
as a way of predicting which

00:31:34.614 --> 00:31:38.420
chemicals make their way into
certain environments.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.058
So if you were looking at the
effect of corn on environmental

00:31:42.058 --> 00:31:44.797
quality in the United States,
corn production,

00:31:44.797 --> 00:31:46.990
you would want to know where it
is planted.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:50.804
Predominantly in the Midwestern
part of the U.S.,

00:31:50.804 --> 00:31:55.890
ground zero is pretty much Iowa
through Ohio and Pennsylvania.

00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:00.108
And if you map out the pattern
of chemical use,

00:32:00.108 --> 00:32:03.250
you'll see that herbicides are
applied much more intensely in

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.660
this area than in other parts of
the nation.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:10.073
And that explains why herbicide
residues are detectable in the

00:32:10.073 --> 00:32:14.051
water supplies of nearly 30
million people in the United

00:32:14.051 --> 00:32:16.730
States and also in human
tissues.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:20.463
So that this understanding of
dietary diversity turned out to

00:32:20.463 --> 00:32:24.323
be extremely important because
it had been completely neglected

00:32:24.323 --> 00:32:25.880
by environmental law.
 

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.967
And the diversity in patterns
of exposure in environmental law

00:32:29.967 --> 00:32:33.854
is something that I became
curious about and wondered about

00:32:33.854 --> 00:32:37.875
whether or not you'd find the
same thing relative to drinking

00:32:37.875 --> 00:32:38.680
water.
 

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.259
Would you find the same issue
relative to air quality?

00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:45.329
Are there pockets of high
exposure out there in the

00:32:45.329 --> 00:32:48.461
population that could be
predictable that would make

00:32:48.461 --> 00:32:52.329
environmental law and regulation
able to focus in a way that was

00:32:52.329 --> 00:32:53.619
more effective?
 

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:55.519
And the answer is yes.
 

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:59.130
So as we look across cases over
the next couple of weeks,

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.910
we'll see the same pattern
emerging,

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.160
that once you understand
variability in the diet,

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.951
in other words,
once you focus in and you look

00:33:07.951 --> 00:33:12.468
for pockets of high exposure,
high consumption of corn or

00:33:12.468 --> 00:33:15.700
high consumption of a certain
cluster of foods.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.019
Or you look at certain
populations,

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:21.105
such as athletes,
that have a higher respiration

00:33:21.105 --> 00:33:25.140
rate than non-athletes do,
that because of that higher

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.111
respiration rate,
they're going to absorb more

00:33:28.111 --> 00:33:30.160
chemicals that are present in
the air.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.633
So across a whole array of
different kinds of environmental

00:33:33.633 --> 00:33:35.788
problems that are managed by
law,

00:33:35.788 --> 00:33:38.622
there's basically,
there had been neglect of this

00:33:38.622 --> 00:33:39.980
issue of variability.
 

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.711
So how do you take a body of
law such as the body that I just

00:33:43.711 --> 00:33:46.200
described to you for these
chemicals,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.779
and transform it to be more
sensitive to the reality of

00:33:49.779 --> 00:33:52.828
these patterns of chemical use
and exposure?

00:33:52.828 --> 00:33:56.465
So what I'm painting here is a
picture of what I think of as

00:33:56.465 --> 00:33:58.868
fractured science and fractured
law,

00:33:58.868 --> 00:34:02.579
so that the legal authority for
pesticides is now broken into

00:34:02.579 --> 00:34:05.468
three different bureaus,
the Environmental Protection

00:34:05.468 --> 00:34:07.057
Agency,
that is responsible for

00:34:07.057 --> 00:34:10.059
tolerance setting,
but also toxicity testing.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:12.538
The Food and Drug
Administration is responsible

00:34:12.538 --> 00:34:14.909
for detecting residues in the
food supply.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:17.507
And the Department of
Agriculture is responsible for

00:34:17.507 --> 00:34:20.409
the enforcement of these
statutes in meat and poultry,

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:25.014
and also for the assessment of
economic benefits associated

00:34:25.014 --> 00:34:28.349
with producing the nation's food
supply.

00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:30.632
So you've got these different
agencies with different legal

00:34:30.632 --> 00:34:32.719
mandates, and they tend not to
talk to one another.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:36.320
So that in Great Britain,
they've created a new food

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.273
safety organization that is
really quite distinctive as a

00:34:40.273 --> 00:34:40.980
model.
 

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.748
They had the same fractured
pattern of bureaucratic control

00:34:43.748 --> 00:34:45.800
in Great Britain,
and they decided that they

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.090
would consolidate that.
 

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.210
They'd centralize the authority
in one group.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.309
And it's very curious,
because by doing that,

00:34:52.309 --> 00:34:55.956
it has allowed conservative
administrations to slow down

00:34:55.956 --> 00:34:59.869
regulation and to become less
environmentally protected much

00:34:59.869 --> 00:35:03.251
more quickly than if the
authority is diffused among

00:35:03.251 --> 00:35:04.909
different agencies.
 

00:35:04.909 --> 00:35:07.059
So this is a very interesting
kind of a problem.

00:35:07.059 --> 00:35:10.311
The primary authority for
tolerance setting was taken away

00:35:10.311 --> 00:35:12.480
from the Department of
Agriculture,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.579
just like the authority for
regulating nuclear power was

00:35:16.579 --> 00:35:20.159
taken away from the Atomic
Energy Commission,

00:35:20.159 --> 00:35:23.340
so the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission was created.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.896
So you don't want the producer
and the protector of the public

00:35:26.896 --> 00:35:29.869
interest to be sitting inside
the same organization,

00:35:29.869 --> 00:35:31.969
that's really the key
principle.

00:35:31.969 --> 00:35:39.164
For those of you that I haven't
stunned to death enough with

00:35:39.164 --> 00:35:43.630
this lecture so far,
if you want to know more about

00:35:43.630 --> 00:35:45.789
pesticide science and history in
law,

00:35:45.789 --> 00:35:48.510
I published this book about ten
years ago,

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:52.572
and this really details the
description of how we discovered

00:35:52.572 --> 00:35:56.702
that kids were more exposed to
many different pesticides than

00:35:56.702 --> 00:36:00.666
adults,
that was eventually adopted

00:36:00.666 --> 00:36:05.199
into the Food Quality Protection
Act,

00:36:05.199 --> 00:36:06.579
passed in 1996.
 

00:36:06.579 --> 00:36:10.157
So that this law was designed
to deal with this problem of

00:36:10.157 --> 00:36:13.170
risk being not equally
distributed in society.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.550
And it included a new general
safety standard.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:19.447
It did away with the
risk-benefit balancing standard

00:36:19.447 --> 00:36:21.489
and it said,
"Okay, instead,

00:36:21.489 --> 00:36:24.936
EPA must make its choices based
upon the phrase 'reasonable

00:36:24.936 --> 00:36:28.280
certainty of no harm.'"
It's kind of interesting.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.302
If you were given the
assignment to include a decision

00:36:32.302 --> 00:36:35.945
standard in a statute that was
health protective,

00:36:35.945 --> 00:36:37.920
what would you choose?
 

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.440
Would you choose a balancing
standard?

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.880
Probably not.
 

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.070
Would you choose the Delaney
clause model,

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.780
which is a zero-risk standard?
 

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.929
You might.
 

00:36:46.929 --> 00:36:49.269
Would you choose a standard
such as this,

00:36:49.269 --> 00:36:51.260
reasonable certainty of no
harm?

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.621
Well, you can imagine that this
was hammered out politically in

00:36:54.621 --> 00:36:57.927
Congress with great interest on
the part of chemical companies

00:36:57.927 --> 00:37:00.963
and also food manufacturers to
try to understand what its

00:37:00.963 --> 00:37:02.969
implications might be for them.
 

00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:05.559
It also requires a finding of
safety.

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:08.610
This had not been part of the
law until 1996.

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:14.219
So EPA must now find that
chemicals are safe for children.

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:15.949
This is really quite new and
striking.

00:37:15.949 --> 00:37:19.525
And it requires a tenfold
additional safety factor to

00:37:19.525 --> 00:37:23.719
account for uncertainty in the
data that they have as they set

00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:24.889
their limits.
 

00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:29.110
So that this idea of a buffer
zone, if you think the risk is

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:33.188
X, then you have to allow X over
what in order to set your

00:37:33.188 --> 00:37:35.050
standard for exposure?
 

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.059
Well, do you want a tenfold
safety factor?

00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:41.360
Do you want a hundredfold,
a thousand fold?

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.190
Well, the tradition had been to
use a hundredfold safety factor.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:47.478
So if you think that this is
what it is, you account for your

00:37:47.478 --> 00:37:50.440
absence of knowledge or your
ignorance, by dividing the

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.250
allowable level by a hundred.
 

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:53.405
And in this case,
Congress said,

00:37:53.405 --> 00:37:54.559
"That's not good enough.
 

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:57.344
You a have to divide it by an
additional ten to account for

00:37:57.344 --> 00:38:00.130
the uncertainty about the
distributional patterns."

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:03.768
And also, the issue of some
groups being more susceptible to

00:38:03.768 --> 00:38:05.619
these chemicals than others.
 

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:10.306
It also required that the
agency for the first time needed

00:38:10.306 --> 00:38:15.570
to consider how people might be
exposed to the same chemical,

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:21.300
not just from food or different
crops,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.806
but food, drinking water,
and other kinds of

00:38:24.806 --> 00:38:26.030
environments.
 

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:28.610
So the same chemical might be
sprayed on fruits and

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.139
vegetables, and it might get
into dairy cattle.

00:38:31.139 --> 00:38:33.659
But it also might be sprayed in
your apartment building.

00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:37.389
Or it also might be used as an
algaecide in a swimming pool.

00:38:37.389 --> 00:38:41.572
So that formerly EPA had just
kind of given out licenses as

00:38:41.572 --> 00:38:44.889
USDA had to these different
allowable uses,

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:48.132
and not thought about the fact
that to somebody as they

00:38:48.132 --> 00:38:51.735
basically walked through their
daily life could be exposed to

00:38:51.735 --> 00:38:55.519
the same chemical across these
environmental compartments,

00:38:55.519 --> 00:38:56.699
so to speak.
 

00:38:56.699 --> 00:38:58.440
So the idea of aggregate risk
is new,

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.795
and it's an attempt to think
about the complexity of the way

00:39:01.795 --> 00:39:04.809
that these compounds can move
through environments.

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:07.920
The idea of cumulative risk is
also new.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.463
That the government had to
consider the idea that a group

00:39:11.463 --> 00:39:15.070
of chemicals might act the same
way in the human body,

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:17.119
and the risk might be at least
additive,

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:18.590
if not synergistic.
 

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:22.632
So for the first time in 1996,
EPA had to review all of its

00:39:22.632 --> 00:39:25.699
tolerances to think about
cumulative risk.

00:39:25.699 --> 00:39:29.943
And the pace of review was also
sped up so that all chemicals

00:39:29.943 --> 00:39:33.480
that it had licensed had to be
reviewed by 2006.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.579
That was accomplished,
quite remarkably.

00:39:36.579 --> 00:39:41.710
But the critique I could give
you of the quality of the review

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.730
is a different matter.
 

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:46.253
And finally,
Congress directed the agency

00:39:46.253 --> 00:39:49.409
not to give equal attention to
every pesticide,

00:39:49.409 --> 00:39:52.253
but to come through,
or to develop some sort of a

00:39:52.253 --> 00:39:55.396
strategy to concentrate and
focus on chemicals that it

00:39:55.396 --> 00:39:57.530
thought would be the most risky.
 

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:58.820
So how would you do that?
 

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.690
How would you define the most
risky chemicals?

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.896
Well, you'd try to find those
that had the highest

00:40:04.896 --> 00:40:06.268
dose-response rate.
 

00:40:06.268 --> 00:40:08.375
In other words,
they seemed like they were the

00:40:08.375 --> 00:40:09.920
most potent, or the most toxic.
 

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.684
But you'd also probably want to
concentrate on chemicals that

00:40:12.684 --> 00:40:14.784
were persistent,
chemicals that got into

00:40:14.784 --> 00:40:16.860
different environmental
compartments,

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:22.170
or chemicals that were used in
food or environments that people

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:25.150
frequent,
foods that people eat a lot of

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:28.139
or environments that were highly
frequented,

00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:35.289
such as schools or such as
occupational settings or homes.

00:40:35.289 --> 00:40:38.449
So that the idea of strategic
attention on the most toxic

00:40:38.449 --> 00:40:40.480
chemicals is an important
concept.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:46.268
So what's happened here as you
think back across history?

00:40:46.268 --> 00:40:49.648
You've got kind of a sequence
of changing regulatory

00:40:49.648 --> 00:40:50.510
priorities.
 

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:52.750
And you might ask yourself,
well, why is that?

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:56.364
So that the first attempt back
in 1906 was to protect the

00:40:56.364 --> 00:40:59.530
economy of farmers against
fraudulent labeling.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:05.429
Then the obligation became to
protect food and crop uses.

00:41:05.429 --> 00:41:10.005
So set limits for levels of
residue in different kinds of

00:41:10.005 --> 00:41:10.659
foods.
 

00:41:10.659 --> 00:41:14.985
Then wildlife residues became
extremely important as people

00:41:14.985 --> 00:41:19.684
worried about how chemicals were
causing decline in species that

00:41:19.684 --> 00:41:23.340
were really much loved in the
United States,

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:26.289
particularly large raptors,
bald eagles,

00:41:26.289 --> 00:41:29.219
the national symbol,
or the gold eagle,

00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:32.909
the peregrine falcon,
ospreys that now you can see

00:41:32.909 --> 00:41:37.050
coming back along the shoreline
here in Connecticut,

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.079
if you take the train from New
Haven up to Boston,

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:40.755
for example,
and look out over the salt

00:41:40.755 --> 00:41:42.690
marshes,
you'll see these poles sitting

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.820
in the middle of salt marshes
with ospreys.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.976
Ospreys came very close to
extinction because of the

00:41:47.976 --> 00:41:51.688
chemical DDT that was building
up in its body and causing its

00:41:51.688 --> 00:41:55.340
eggshells to thin so its
reproductive success declined.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:59.012
Soil contamination became
important as instances where a

00:41:59.012 --> 00:42:03.086
chemical had been used in the
field one year and had persisted

00:42:03.086 --> 00:42:04.289
in that field.
 

00:42:04.289 --> 00:42:08.054
Another tenant farmer comes
along the next year and plants a

00:42:08.054 --> 00:42:09.139
different crop.
 

00:42:09.139 --> 00:42:12.885
That crop is not permitted to
have that chemical used on it,

00:42:12.885 --> 00:42:16.693
but it absorbed the chemical up
through its roots and becomes

00:42:16.693 --> 00:42:17.710
adulterated.
 

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.820
So that failure to think about
soil contamination was causing

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.570
some foods to become adulterated
in ways that were not

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:24.400
predictable.
 

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.617
And drinking water
contamination has come late to

00:42:26.617 --> 00:42:29.159
the attention of the
Environmental Protection Agency.

00:42:29.159 --> 00:42:30.380
Why would that be?
 

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.262
You know, if you think about
water as one of the most

00:42:33.262 --> 00:42:35.260
consumed foods in the human
diet,

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:37.523
why wouldn't the government
have paid more attention to

00:42:37.523 --> 00:42:37.860
water?
 

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.389
Also think about indoor
environments.

00:42:40.389 --> 00:42:44.277
I've come to believe that all
of the attention given to food

00:42:44.277 --> 00:42:48.230
is really probably misplaced
relative to exposures that occur

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.010
in indoor environments.
 

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:54.309
So that in many situations
today, people can be in rooms

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:58.139
when they are sprayed by a
licensed applicator.

00:42:58.139 --> 00:43:01.490
So the exposures that occur
after that often are far,

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:04.972
far higher than the exposures
that come from food-borne

00:43:04.972 --> 00:43:05.809
residues.
 

00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:09.105
The idea that the susceptible
need attention,

00:43:09.105 --> 00:43:12.550
this is new in environmental
law as of 1996.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:16.130
And new areas that deserve
additional attention that I

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:20.402
think are extremely important,
is the use of these chemicals

00:43:20.402 --> 00:43:24.630
as they're impregnated into a
variety of consumer products.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:29.050
So if you're hiking long
distances,

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.614
you may want a pesticide
impregnated into the fabric that

00:43:31.614 --> 00:43:33.181
you buy,
if you don't have an

00:43:33.181 --> 00:43:34.989
opportunity to wash your
clothes.

00:43:34.989 --> 00:43:38.230
But what does that mean?
 

00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:41.550
There are a whole new array of
products in the marketplace now

00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:44.762
that carry these residues,
for obvious functions,

00:43:44.762 --> 00:43:49.480
such as durability,
keeping them from degrading.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.139
Pesticides are added to paints,
for example,

00:43:52.139 --> 00:43:55.795
to keep the bacteria in paint
from breaking it down and

00:43:55.795 --> 00:44:00.059
chipping and causing you to have
to repaint in a short period of

00:44:00.059 --> 00:44:00.670
time.
 

00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:03.682
So that the functional side of
these chemicals used in consumer

00:44:03.682 --> 00:44:05.530
products is pretty well
understood,

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:09.030
but the long-term implications
for environmental quality and

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:10.809
human health really are not.
 

00:44:10.809 --> 00:44:15.543
So the underlying problems here
include the human inability to

00:44:15.543 --> 00:44:17.250
sense chemical risk.
 

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:20.065
You know, we basically don't
know where these chemicals are

00:44:20.065 --> 00:44:22.202
in our environment because we
can't see them,

00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:24.340
we can't taste them,
we can't feel them.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:29.150
We have to imply where they are
by proxy, thinking about

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:34.659
"Gee, I'm living on a tract
of land and I've got a well.

00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:36.429
And this used to be a farmland.
 

00:44:36.429 --> 00:44:37.789
Maybe I ought to test my
drinking water."

00:44:37.789 --> 00:44:42.349
Or, "I'm living next to a
field that is planted with a

00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:46.989
crop that's routinely sprayed by
a plane that flies over.

00:44:46.989 --> 00:44:49.619
Maybe the drift is getting into
my environment."

00:44:49.619 --> 00:44:53.371
So that thinking about where
these things are in the

00:44:53.371 --> 00:44:57.420
environment really demands a
certain level of background

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.320
literacy and knowledge that
often is not present.

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:05.313
The underlying problem of lack
of sensitivity to susceptibility

00:45:05.313 --> 00:45:06.730
is really important.
 

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:08.119
Who's susceptible?
 

00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:09.690
Well, the very youngest are.
 

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:13.619
And remember that all these
concentrations are measured how?

00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:15.800
They're expressed per unit of
your body weight.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.969
So when in life does a human
have the lowest body weight?

00:45:20.969 --> 00:45:24.699
In utero, first trimester.
 

00:45:24.699 --> 00:45:30.496
So if the concentration in the
mom is the same moving across

00:45:30.496 --> 00:45:35.409
the placenta as the
concentration in the fetus,

00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:38.925
and you get to an exposure
estimate by taking that

00:45:38.925 --> 00:45:42.369
concentration and dividing it by
body weight,

00:45:42.369 --> 00:45:46.099
and the mom's body weight might
be 160 pounds and the fetus'

00:45:46.099 --> 00:45:48.880
body weight might be a quarter
of a pound.

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:50.960
I'm sorry Laura, about this.
 

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:54.699
You get the idea.
 

00:45:54.699 --> 00:45:58.242
The same concentration in the
environment affects the fetus

00:45:58.242 --> 00:46:00.929
much more than it would the
average adult.

00:46:00.929 --> 00:46:03.456
So this has really transformed
the way that government

00:46:03.456 --> 00:46:06.268
regulators have begun to think
about chemical management.

00:46:06.268 --> 00:46:08.690
We've had poor monitoring of
chemical release.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.985
We have thought much more about
chemical persistence and

00:46:11.985 --> 00:46:15.221
environmental fate having
learned from strontium-90 and

00:46:15.221 --> 00:46:16.300
the DDT story.
 

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:20.400
And we've misunderstood
variability in human exposure.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.239
Still we're not putting
monitors on individual people.

00:46:24.239 --> 00:46:28.262
Although increasingly,
the government is monitoring

00:46:28.262 --> 00:46:31.710
human tissue,
taking blood and urine and hair

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:35.612
samples to try to figure out
what the matrix of chemicals

00:46:35.612 --> 00:46:38.750
might be that an individual is
exposed to.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:42.650
So looking not just by sampling
in the marketplace,

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:48.219
but looking at this pattern by
taking human tissue samples,

00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:51.704
this is a whole new wave that's
giving people the opportunity

00:46:51.704 --> 00:46:53.969
literally to go to a doctor and
say,

00:46:53.969 --> 00:46:56.889
"I want to be measured for
this entire array of

00:46:56.889 --> 00:46:57.920
chemicals."
 

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.425
So it may cost you a couple
thousand dollars to go through

00:47:00.425 --> 00:47:02.385
that process,
but increasingly people are

00:47:02.385 --> 00:47:05.065
doing this,
trying to make some sense out

00:47:05.065 --> 00:47:08.806
of the way that they feel,
their medical condition,

00:47:08.806 --> 00:47:10.760
and environmental quality.
 

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.880
Single chemical exposure is
still the focus of government.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.342
No company wants its chemical
to be compared to another

00:47:17.342 --> 00:47:20.550
company when they're making a
regulatory choice.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.907
Toxicity testing is incomplete
in a variety of areas,

00:47:24.907 --> 00:47:28.510
especially relative to the
immune system.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:31.172
And you know the rise in
allergies that we're

00:47:31.172 --> 00:47:33.170
experiencing,
severe allergies.

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:37.347
More people are walking around
with Epi-Pens today because of

00:47:37.347 --> 00:47:40.480
worries about anaphylaxis than
ever before.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.500
Something is happening to the
human immune system.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.474
It's not clear why,
but many of the chemicals that

00:47:45.474 --> 00:47:47.719
are released,
such as some pesticides,

00:47:47.719 --> 00:47:50.210
do influence the human immune
system.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:53.458
That's one example of an area
of human health that has been

00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:55.139
neglected by the government.
 

00:47:55.139 --> 00:48:00.768
Also, the endocrine effects are
quite misunderstood.

00:48:00.768 --> 00:48:05.543
The behavior of these chemicals
as human hormones--that we'll

00:48:05.543 --> 00:48:07.929
speak about a bit next week.
 

00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:10.849
Also, failure of labeling as a
management strategy.

00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:13.813
Labeling is still the dominant
approach that EPA takes to try

00:48:13.813 --> 00:48:16.793
to inform the public,
to educate the public how they

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:20.380
might be able to use these
economic poisons in as safe way.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.748
But you need to think about
whether or not that's really a

00:48:22.748 --> 00:48:24.994
potentially effective way of
controlling these kinds of

00:48:24.994 --> 00:48:25.409
risks.
 

00:48:25.409 --> 00:48:29.480
And we're also misunderstanding
trends in human illness.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:33.356
For example,
we had no asthma registry in

00:48:33.356 --> 00:48:35.780
Connecticut until 2003.
 

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.655
So we couldn't figure out
whether or not people that lived

00:48:39.655 --> 00:48:43.532
in areas that have had higher
levels of air pollution were

00:48:43.532 --> 00:48:45.639
more likely to have asthma.
 

00:48:45.639 --> 00:48:49.842
So the absence of surveillance
of health conditions makes it

00:48:49.842 --> 00:48:54.190
impossible to correlate these
exposures to health outcomes.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.951
And finally,
a variance in human capacity to

00:48:56.951 --> 00:48:57.849
manage risk.
 

00:48:57.849 --> 00:49:00.934
There's a real environmental
justice issue here that needs to

00:49:00.934 --> 00:49:04.112
be paid attention to,
that there are many members of

00:49:04.112 --> 00:49:07.802
society that do not have the
capacity to get the education

00:49:07.802 --> 00:49:09.940
necessary to self-manage risk.
 

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:14.385
So that some people simply are
more reliant on government

00:49:14.385 --> 00:49:17.639
standard setting than other
people are.

00:49:17.639 --> 00:49:20.980
So these are all underlying
problems of law,

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:25.717
and all of them are pretty well
exemplified by this history of

00:49:25.717 --> 00:49:27.583
pesticide management.
 

00:49:27.583 --> 00:49:30.090
Okay, that's it for today.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.809
And we'll come back on Tuesday.
 

00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:34.070
Have a great weekend.
 

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:39.000

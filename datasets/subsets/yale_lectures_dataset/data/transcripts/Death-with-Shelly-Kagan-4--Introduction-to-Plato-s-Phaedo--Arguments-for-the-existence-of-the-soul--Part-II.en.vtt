00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.531
Professor Shelly Kagan:
We've been talking about the

00:00:03.531 --> 00:00:06.077
question, "What arguments might
be offered for the existence of

00:00:06.077 --> 00:00:08.029
a soul?"
And the family of arguments

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.433
that we're considering initially
are arguments that get known as

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:14.190
inference or inferences to the
best explanation.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.582
The thought is that there's
something about us that needs

00:00:17.582 --> 00:00:20.073
explaining.
We can't explain it in terms

00:00:20.073 --> 00:00:23.567
of… in purely physical terms.
And so we need to appeal to,

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:25.447
we need to posit,
the existence of,

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:28.332
a soul.
Now, I'll come back to that

00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:33.256
sort of argument in just a
minute, but let me bracket that

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:37.230
for a moment and say something
about Plato.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.618
Starting next week,
we're going to be looking at

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:41.550
Plato's dialogue,
the Phaedo.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.934
And so although I'll be saying
a great deal about the

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:45.540
Phaedo once we turn to
it,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.751
I want to just take a minute or
two and say a couple of

00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.822
introductory remarks.
I don't know how many of you

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:55.168
have not read any Plato before,
but for those of you who

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:58.270
haven't, I actually think you're
in for a treat.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.295
Plato is not only one of the
greatest philosophers in

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:06.939
history, he wrote his philosophy
in the form of dialogues.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.295
That is to say,
plays, in which various

00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:14.887
characters sit around or stand
around and argue about

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:19.590
philosophical positions.
The particular dialogue that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.094
we're going to be reading,
the Phaedo,

00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:26.360
is set at the death scene of
Socrates.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.998
As I'm sure you know,
Socrates was put on trial,

00:01:29.998 --> 00:01:33.482
condemned to death for
corrupting the youth of

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:36.626
Athens--and perhaps,
among other things,

00:01:36.626 --> 00:01:38.930
for arguing philosophy with
them.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.047
And he's given hemlock,
poison, and he drinks it and he

00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:49.280
dies.
Now, this is a historical event.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.705
Socrates had a circle of
friends and disciples that he

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:59.510
would argue philosophy with.
One of his disciples was Plato.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.660
Plato then grew up and wrote
philosophical works.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.009
Plato does not typically appear
in his own dialogues.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.323
Or, if he does,
he's only there as a minor

00:02:14.323 --> 00:02:18.369
character.
In fact, if I recall correctly,

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:24.890
Plato's mentioned as not being
there on the day that Socrates

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.198
dies.
So, how do we know,

00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:30.831
if we've got this play,
whose position is Plato's

00:02:30.831 --> 00:02:33.932
position?
And the answer--the short

00:02:33.932 --> 00:02:38.317
answer--is, Socrates,
the character Socrates in the

00:02:38.317 --> 00:02:42.527
play, represents Plato,
the author of the play's,

00:02:42.527 --> 00:02:45.565
philosophical views.
Now, in fact,

00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:49.143
if this were a class in ancient
philosophy, we'd have to

00:02:49.143 --> 00:02:53.922
complicate that picture,
because it's fairly clear that

00:02:53.922 --> 00:03:00.269
by late in Plato's career Plato
has philosophical views that are

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.810
very much unlike the views of
his teacher, Socrates.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.409
And yet Plato continues to not
appear in the dialogue.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.509
Socrates continues to be sort
of the hero.

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:17.241
And so scholars debate which of
the views put forward by

00:03:17.241 --> 00:03:22.316
Socrates in which ones of the
dialogues represent views that

00:03:22.316 --> 00:03:26.789
belong to the actual historical
figure Socrates,

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:29.656
and which of the views put
forward by the character

00:03:29.656 --> 00:03:32.751
Socrates in which of the
dialogues represent views that

00:03:32.751 --> 00:03:35.789
are actually not held by the
historical Socrates,

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:39.870
but were instead held by the
historical Plato and were merely

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.930
put in the mouth of the
character Socrates.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.988
Scholars distinguish between
the early Platonic dialogues,

00:03:46.988 --> 00:03:49.479
the so-called Socratic
dialogues,

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.187
where the thought is,
those are the views of

00:03:52.187 --> 00:03:54.770
Socrates, the actual historical
figure.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.801
And then there's the late
dialogues, where even though

00:03:57.801 --> 00:04:00.547
Socrates appears,
most scholars believe those are

00:04:00.547 --> 00:04:03.921
probably not the views that the
historical Socrates actually

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:06.687
believed.
You have middle dialogues where

00:04:06.687 --> 00:04:09.580
you have to worry about whose
views are whose.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.650
But we're not going to worry.
This is not a class in ancient

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.608
philosophy.
So for our purposes,

00:04:15.608 --> 00:04:18.850
we don't have to ask ourselves
when Socrates in the dialogue

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.692
says something,
is this a view that the dead

00:04:21.692 --> 00:04:25.728
man Socrates actually would have
held or is this simply a view

00:04:25.728 --> 00:04:29.433
that the dead man Plato put in
the mouth of the character

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:31.400
Socrates?
For our purposes,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.648
it won't really matter.
I'll take every view that

00:04:34.648 --> 00:04:38.490
Socrates puts forward as a view
of Plato's, though I'll

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.545
typically sort of run back and
forth sort of in a careless

00:04:42.545 --> 00:04:45.222
fashion.
I'll say, "Plato holds" or

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:49.470
"Socrates argues," because for
our purposes it's all the same.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.421
But there's one other
complication that you've got to

00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:52.660
be warned about,
which is this.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.453
Because these are dialogues and
they take the form of

00:04:57.453 --> 00:05:01.807
philosophical arguments,
people put forward views and

00:05:01.807 --> 00:05:05.861
then, over the course of the
discussion, change their minds

00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:09.720
about things.
And they take them back.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.503
And maybe something similar is
going on when Socrates says

00:05:14.503 --> 00:05:17.182
something.
Because, after all,

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:21.230
this isn't Plato saying,
"Here's what I believe

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.065
explicitly."
He's just writing a dramatic

00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:27.003
play about philosophy.
And so sometimes we'll find

00:05:27.003 --> 00:05:30.077
ourselves thinking,
"You know, there's an argument

00:05:30.077 --> 00:05:32.649
here that Socrates is putting
forward.

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:34.910
But maybe it's not a very good
argument."

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.675
And it will,
at least, be worth pausing

00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:42.040
periodically to ask ourselves,
maybe Plato realized it wasn't

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:46.268
a very good argument.
We can often better understand

00:05:46.268 --> 00:05:50.923
the dialogues by seeing Socrates
as putting forward certain

00:05:50.923 --> 00:05:55.740
positions that he does not think
are altogether adequate.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.137
And he modifies them or revises
them or introduces new positions

00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:04.046
to deal with some of the
difficulties that he was setting

00:06:04.046 --> 00:06:08.219
himself to be open to earlier.
As I say, don't worry about any

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.006
of those details now,
but it's a point to keep in

00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:14.483
mind as you read the dialogues.
So that's all I really wanted

00:06:14.483 --> 00:06:17.750
to say by way of introduction.
You should start reading the

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.810
Phaedo for next week.
We'll be talking about the

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.110
Phaedo starting some time
next week and we'll continue the

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:27.050
discussion of the Phaedo
for at least a bit of,

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.889
maybe all of,
the week after that.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.069
In the case of Plato,
I'm going to make an exception.

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.581
Normally, I will mention our
readings, but I won't spend a

00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:41.459
lot of time actually discussing
them in detail.

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:44.593
That's why you have to think of
the readings as complementing

00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:47.571
the lectures or think of the
lectures as complementing the

00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:51.854
readings.
I'm not just giving the Cliff

00:06:51.854 --> 00:06:56.329
Notes, as it were,
of the readings.

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:58.548
Nonetheless,
in the case of the

00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:01.727
Phaedo,
I am going to spend more time

00:07:01.727 --> 00:07:05.129
actually saying,
"Here's what I think the first

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.338
main argument is.
Let's try to reconstruct it in

00:07:08.338 --> 00:07:10.500
terms of its premises and its
conclusions.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.019
Here are some objections I
raise.

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:15.310
Here is then the next argument
that Plato offers.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.959
Let's try to get that up in
premises."

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:20.524
Even there, I won't be spending
time reading out loud long

00:07:20.524 --> 00:07:23.606
passages from the Phaedo.
But, in some sense,

00:07:23.606 --> 00:07:26.326
I'll be giving a closer
commentary of the Phaedo

00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:28.290
than I'll do for the other
readings.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.841
So, still, what you should do
is start reading it for next

00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:37.032
week.
The topic of the Phaedo,

00:07:37.032 --> 00:07:41.720
as I say, is set on Socrates'
last day.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.206
At the end of the dialogue,
he drinks the hemlock and he

00:07:45.206 --> 00:07:47.693
dies.
And perhaps unsurprisingly,

00:07:47.693 --> 00:07:51.703
what he does with his friends
up until that moment is,

00:07:51.703 --> 00:07:55.259
he argues about the immortality
of the soul.

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:58.629
Quite strikingly,
Socrates is not upset.

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:01.129
He's not worried about the fact
that he's going to die.

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:06.308
He actually welcomes this in a
certain way, because he believes

00:08:06.308 --> 00:08:09.625
his soul is immortal.
And so, in addition to

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:13.177
philosophical arguments for and
against the existence and

00:08:13.177 --> 00:08:17.098
immortality of the soul,
we end the dialogue with a

00:08:17.098 --> 00:08:21.939
quite moving death scene,
one of the great death scenes,

00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:25.610
if we could call it that,
of western civilization.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.209
Anyway, as I say,
that's all for next week.

00:08:28.209 --> 00:08:32.616
So let's return now to the
question, "How might we argue

00:08:32.616 --> 00:08:36.550
for the existence of the soul?"
Initially, last time,

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.683
we considered a set of or a
subset of arguments that

00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:42.755
basically said,
"Look, there's got to be more

00:08:42.755 --> 00:08:45.059
to us than just material
objects.

00:08:45.059 --> 00:08:48.970
People can't just be machines,
because machines can't reason.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.799
Machines can't think."
And I said, "That doesn't seem

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:56.421
to be a compelling argument."
After all, chess-playing

00:08:56.421 --> 00:08:59.159
computers, it seems,
can reason.

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:01.700
They have beliefs about what
I'm likely to do next.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.771
They have desires about the
goals that they're trying to

00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:07.091
achieve.
They reason about how best to

00:09:07.091 --> 00:09:09.393
defeat me.
And it's worth pointing out

00:09:09.393 --> 00:09:13.144
that--a point that I didn't make
last time--it's worth pointing

00:09:13.144 --> 00:09:14.739
out that,
what the computers,

00:09:14.739 --> 00:09:17.120
at least the best chess-playing
computers don't do.

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.240
Indeed, no computer actually
does this.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.235
You might think that what a
computer, what a chess-playing

00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:26.385
computer does is just this.
It calculates every possible

00:09:26.385 --> 00:09:30.700
branch, every possible game from
here on out.

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.250
And then it sort of works
backwards.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.000
"Oh, these are the ones where
I'll win."

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.815
And so it only makes the move
where it can sort of look ahead

00:09:37.815 --> 00:09:40.804
20 moves, right,
and see which branches have the

00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:43.715
computer winning.
That is not the way

00:09:43.715 --> 00:09:48.714
chess-playing programs work.
For the simple reason that the

00:09:48.714 --> 00:09:54.076
number of possible chess games
is so huge, that computers can't

00:09:54.076 --> 00:09:57.801
calculate it.
They'd be busy for thousands of

00:09:57.801 --> 00:09:59.702
years.
We can do that sort of:

00:09:59.702 --> 00:10:03.224
When you play tic-tac-toe with
your seven-year old nephew or

00:10:03.224 --> 00:10:06.149
niece, you just look ahead and
work backwards.

00:10:06.149 --> 00:10:07.945
"Well, if I do that,
he'll do that and he'll do that

00:10:07.945 --> 00:10:09.600
and then he wins,
so I won't do that," right?

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.860
But we can't do that with chess.
There's just too many games.

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.856
So how do chess-playing
programs, and particularly the

00:10:17.856 --> 00:10:20.570
best chess-playing programs,
how do they work?

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:24.190
Well, they play chess the same
way you do.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.678
They have various ideas about
which pieces are more powerful

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:31.950
and so they're more important to
protect.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.789
They've got various ideas about
which strategies tend to be

00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:39.038
successful.
What sorts of dangers come

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:42.608
along with them?
If you're a serious chess

00:10:42.608 --> 00:10:47.026
player, you might study some of
the great games of chess

00:10:47.026 --> 00:10:50.089
history.
And indeed, when they program

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:53.170
these things,
the programmers will feed in

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.153
game after game after game of
the great chess games in

00:10:57.153 --> 00:10:59.927
history.
And then armed with all of

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:03.614
that, you sort of do your best.
And when you lose a game,

00:11:03.614 --> 00:11:06.857
you kind of make a mental note
to yourself, "That really

00:11:06.857 --> 00:11:08.888
screwed me up.
Let me try something different

00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:11.227
next time."
And you avoid those sorts of

00:11:11.227 --> 00:11:15.034
moves.
That's how chess-playing

00:11:15.034 --> 00:11:18.720
programs work as well.
Jumping ahead,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.722
let me make a remark about
this, because this is going to

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:23.009
be relevant for something I'll
get to in a couple of minutes.

00:11:23.009 --> 00:11:28.078
What this means--what this,
the implication--is that if

00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:32.490
you're playing a great
chess-playing program,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:39.026
it's not as though the way to
tell what it's going to do is to

00:11:39.026 --> 00:11:43.419
study its program and think it
through.

00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:47.795
The people who design these
programs, presumably fairly

00:11:47.795 --> 00:11:52.383
decent chess players themselves,
the people who design these

00:11:52.383 --> 00:11:56.049
programs, when they're playing
the programs they're not

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:58.629
thinking to themselves,
"Let's see.

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:01.935
I programmed this computer so
that when I move a queen forward

00:12:01.935 --> 00:12:04.049
to this space,
it should come out with a

00:12:04.049 --> 00:12:06.110
bishop."
That's hopeless.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.106
Because the program is
constantly revising its

00:12:09.106 --> 00:12:13.234
strategies, in light of what's
worked and what hasn't worked in

00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:15.883
the past.
When the programmers play these

00:12:15.883 --> 00:12:18.990
programs or indeed when anybody,
a good chess player,

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:22.805
plays these programs,
the best way to try to beat

00:12:22.805 --> 00:12:27.736
them is simply ask yourself,
"What's the best move to make

00:12:27.736 --> 00:12:30.688
right now?"
The odds are the computer's

00:12:30.688 --> 00:12:33.360
going to make the best possible
move.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:40.620
Treat the computer as though it
were just a great chess player.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:45.769
And indeed, the best programs
are great chess players.

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:49.265
There was a period of time in
which, although there were

00:12:49.265 --> 00:12:52.570
decent, chess-playing programs
couldn't beat the best

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.567
chess-playing humans.
That ended some years ago when

00:12:56.567 --> 00:13:00.340
the best programs began to beat
grand masters.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.115
And now it's in fact the case
that the best programs can beat

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:08.618
pretty much anybody.
In the current world champion

00:13:08.618 --> 00:13:13.995
of chess, I think Vladimir
Kramnik, was defeated in

00:13:13.995 --> 00:13:18.190
December by a chess-playing
program.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:25.389
So Kramnik's simply treating
this as an awesome opponent.

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.670
And that's the best way to deal
with these things.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.010
All right.
So, bracket some of those

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.973
thoughts for a moment.
We'll come back to them a

00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:36.238
little bit later when we start
talking about the question,

00:13:36.238 --> 00:13:38.423
"Could machines be creative?"
Tipping my hand,

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:41.851
it seems pretty clear that that
seems like the right thing to

00:13:41.851 --> 00:13:44.250
say about these chess-playing
programs.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.919
So we had the question,
"Could machines,

00:13:46.919 --> 00:13:49.647
could machines reason?"
And although we don't have

00:13:49.647 --> 00:13:51.681
machines that can reason about a
lot of subjects yet,

00:13:51.681 --> 00:13:54.548
it seems pretty clear.
It seems like the natural thing

00:13:54.548 --> 00:13:57.960
to suggest, machines can reason
in at least some areas.

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.991
And so it doesn't seem
plausible to suggest that we

00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:05.281
people must not be physical,
merely physical,

00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:07.787
because after all,
we can reason and no machine

00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:10.779
can reason.
No, machines could reason.

00:14:10.779 --> 00:14:14.346
But this prompts a different
move on the part of the defender

00:14:14.346 --> 00:14:16.947
of souls.
Perhaps the argument shouldn't

00:14:16.947 --> 00:14:21.036
be, "we have to believe in souls
because no mere physical object

00:14:21.036 --> 00:14:24.911
could reason."
Perhaps the argument should be,

00:14:24.911 --> 00:14:30.275
"we have to believe in souls
because no mere physical object,

00:14:30.275 --> 00:14:34.320
no machine could feel."
You know, we have emotions.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.930
We love.
We're afraid.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.990
We're worried.
We'll get elated.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.154
We get depressed.
So perhaps the argument should

00:14:45.154 --> 00:14:47.669
go "Yeah, yeah,
thinking, that's the sort of

00:14:47.669 --> 00:14:50.392
thing a machine can do.
You know, we call them thinking

00:14:50.392 --> 00:14:51.688
machines.
But feeling,

00:14:51.688 --> 00:14:55.169
that's the sort of thing no
machine could do.

00:14:55.169 --> 00:14:58.105
No purely physical object could
feel anything,

00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:01.418
could have emotions.
And so, since we clearly do

00:15:01.418 --> 00:15:05.800
feel things, there must be more
to us than a physical object."

00:15:10.779 --> 00:15:16.122
Now, I think it is plausible to
suggest that unlike the case of

00:15:16.122 --> 00:15:20.861
chess-playing computers,
we don't yet have machines that

00:15:20.861 --> 00:15:24.649
feel things.
But the question isn't, "do we?"

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:27.509
The question is,
"could there be a machine that

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:30.618
could feel something,
could have an emotion of some

00:15:30.618 --> 00:15:33.053
sort?"
So let's go a little science

00:15:33.053 --> 00:15:37.132
fictiony and think about some of
the robots that have been shown

00:15:37.132 --> 00:15:40.866
in science fiction movies,
some of the computer programs

00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:43.940
that have been shown in science
fiction movies,

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.149
science fiction novels,
or what have you.

00:15:48.149 --> 00:15:51.749
When I was a kid there was a
television show called Lost

00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:55.008
in Space.
I'm afraid I've forgotten the

00:15:55.008 --> 00:15:58.299
name of the robot that was on
that show.

00:15:58.299 --> 00:16:02.262
But as it was a TV show and so
sure enough, every single

00:16:02.262 --> 00:16:06.080
episode, some new dramatic
danger would take place.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.371
And the robot would start
whizzing and binging and shout

00:16:10.371 --> 00:16:13.179
out, "Danger,
Commander Robinson!"

00:16:13.179 --> 00:16:14.700
"Danger, Will Robinson!" that
was it.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:19.876
"Danger, Will Robinson!"
It seemed as though the robot

00:16:19.876 --> 00:16:23.129
was worried.
More recent example.

00:16:23.129 --> 00:16:26.239
A number of you have probably
read some of Douglas Adams'

00:16:26.239 --> 00:16:29.349
books The Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy and the

00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:33.080
sequels to that.
There's a robot in those books,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.475
Marvin, who's --depressed,
I think is the simple word

00:16:37.475 --> 00:16:40.009
about it.
He sort of--He is very smart.

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:43.413
He's thought about the
universe, thinks life is

00:16:43.413 --> 00:16:46.920
pointless and he acts depressed.
He talks to another robot,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.860
depresses the other robot.
The other robot commits suicide.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.369
All right.
Seems natural to ascribe

00:16:53.369 --> 00:16:56.160
depression to Marvin,
the robot.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.827
That's how he behaves.
Or, my favorite example,

00:17:01.827 --> 00:17:06.339
the movie 2001:
A Space Odyssey.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:09.313
Now, I've got to tell you,
for those of you who have not

00:17:09.313 --> 00:17:11.530
seen this movie,
I'm about to spoil it.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.950
All right?
So you cover your ears.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.213
In 2001: A Space
Odyssey, we get some kind of

00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:21.349
indication that there's life on
another planet.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:27.580
It's all very mysterious and we
send off a spaceship to

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:33.464
investigate the markings,
the radio signals from the

00:17:33.464 --> 00:17:37.297
other place.
This is a very important

00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:41.933
mission and so there is a
computer program named Hal that

00:17:41.933 --> 00:17:46.818
helps run the ship and takes a
lot of the burdens off of the

00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:51.289
part of the human astronauts who
are on the ship.

00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:54.240
Hal's got the goal--in terms of
reasoning and desires and so

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.289
forth and so on--Hal's got the
goal of making sure the mission

00:17:57.289 --> 00:18:00.004
is successful.
But Hal thinks to himself

00:18:00.004 --> 00:18:03.559
fairly plausibly,
humans really screw things up.

00:18:03.559 --> 00:18:05.319
This is a very important
mission.

00:18:05.319 --> 00:18:08.570
Let's kill the humans to make
sure they don't screw things up.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:18.958
One of the astronauts,
discovering the plot,

00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:24.131
attempts to stop Hal.
And proceeds to do the only

00:18:24.131 --> 00:18:27.850
thing he can do to defend
himself against Hal,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:33.375
which is shut down the program,
basically killing--if we can

00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:37.985
talk that way--killing Hal.
Meanwhile, as all this is going

00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:40.247
on, Hal and Dave,
the human astronaut,

00:18:40.247 --> 00:18:44.279
are talking to each other.
Hal realizes what's going on.

00:18:44.279 --> 00:18:49.549
Hal tries to stop Dave,
understandably enough.

00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:52.995
And Hal says,
as Dave begins to shut down

00:18:52.995 --> 00:18:55.580
Hal's circuits,
"I'm afraid.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.490
I'm afraid, Dave."
What's he afraid of?

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:03.639
He's afraid of dying.
It seems perfectly natural to

00:19:03.639 --> 00:19:09.840
ascribe fear to Hal.
Hal is behaving in exactly the

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:15.435
way you would expect him to
behave, or it to behave,

00:19:15.435 --> 00:19:19.010
if it felt fear.
It's got reason to be afraid.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.846
It's behaving appropriately.
It's telling us that it's

00:19:21.846 --> 00:19:25.838
afraid.
It seems natural to say Hal's

00:19:25.838 --> 00:19:28.535
afraid.
Now, you could continue to sort

00:19:28.535 --> 00:19:31.258
of fill in examples like this.
As I say, of course,

00:19:31.258 --> 00:19:33.881
they're all science fiction,
but the fact that we can

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:36.654
grasp--and it's not as though we
go running away saying,

00:19:36.654 --> 00:19:38.900
"Oh no!
This was outrageous," right?

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.124
"It makes no sense to think a
computer could have said,

00:19:42.124 --> 00:19:45.000
‘I'm afraid.'
It makes no sense to think that

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.660
it could try to kill the people
who are trying to shut it down

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:51.521
and so forth."
That seems to me to be

00:19:51.521 --> 00:19:56.869
prejudice, as I said last time.
The natural inclination here is

00:19:56.869 --> 00:20:01.087
to say, "These computer
programs, these robots are

00:20:01.087 --> 00:20:04.168
feeling emotion."
But there's no particular

00:20:04.168 --> 00:20:07.157
reason to think there's anything
going on there than the

00:20:07.157 --> 00:20:10.983
circuits.
They're just physical objects,

00:20:10.983 --> 00:20:14.450
programs on machines.
If that's right,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:18.512
if that's the right thing to
say, then what we have to say

00:20:18.512 --> 00:20:21.085
is,
"We don't need to appeal to

00:20:21.085 --> 00:20:24.980
souls in order to explain
emotions and feelings.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:28.661
Physical objects could have,
mere physical objects could

00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:33.053
have, emotions and feelings.
So we have no reason to posit

00:20:33.053 --> 00:20:38.345
the existence of a soul."
Now, I think the best response

00:20:38.345 --> 00:20:44.761
on the part of the dualist to
this reply is to distinguish two

00:20:44.761 --> 00:20:49.809
aspects of feelings,
two aspects of emotions.

00:20:49.809 --> 00:20:56.867
There's the behavioral aspect
of feeling fear,

00:20:56.867 --> 00:21:01.277
let's say.
The behavioral aspect is when

00:21:01.277 --> 00:21:06.768
you're aware in the environment
of something that poses a danger

00:21:06.768 --> 00:21:09.427
to you,
that will harm you or destroy

00:21:09.427 --> 00:21:11.953
you, or in the case of a
computer program,

00:21:11.953 --> 00:21:15.745
turn you off,
then you take various kinds of

00:21:15.745 --> 00:21:21.450
behaviors in opposition to that
to try to disarm the danger,

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.498
to try to neutralize it.
This is just a matter of

00:21:25.498 --> 00:21:27.888
beliefs, goals,
responses, planning,

00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:31.576
the sort of thing that we
already saw the chess-playing

00:21:31.576 --> 00:21:37.589
computer can do,
that behavioral side of emotion.

00:21:37.589 --> 00:21:41.660
It seems pretty plausible to
think robots could do that.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:47.667
Physical objects could do that.
But, and here's the crucial

00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:52.490
point of this objection,
there's another side or another

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:58.240
aspect to emotions and feelings.
It's the sensation of what it's

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.514
feeling like--that's why we call
them feelings after all--what

00:22:03.514 --> 00:22:09.948
it's feeling like on the inside,
as it were, while all this

00:22:09.948 --> 00:22:15.100
behavioral stuff's going on.
When I'm afraid,

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.742
I have this certain sort of
clammy feeling or my heart's

00:22:19.742 --> 00:22:23.289
going poundingly.
Your blood is racing.

00:22:23.289 --> 00:22:25.946
When you're afraid,
you've got this sinking feeling

00:22:25.946 --> 00:22:28.153
in the stomach.
When you're depressed,

00:22:28.153 --> 00:22:30.523
there are these,
well, we could call them

00:22:30.523 --> 00:22:33.901
experiences, though the word
"experience" is also somewhat

00:22:33.901 --> 00:22:36.647
ambiguous.
So--we'll use it for the

00:22:36.647 --> 00:22:40.828
moment--there's an experience
that goes along with each

00:22:40.828 --> 00:22:41.680
emotion.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:50.269
There's what it feels like to
you when you're afraid.

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:56.352
What it feels like to you when
you're worried or depressed or

00:22:56.352 --> 00:22:59.711
joyful or in love.
And the thought,

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:03.458
and I think this is a pretty
powerful thought,

00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:08.119
is that even if the robots are
behaving behaviorally,

00:23:08.119 --> 00:23:12.348
they've got the behavior side
of the emotions down,

00:23:12.348 --> 00:23:15.900
they don't have the feeling
side at all.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:24.678
Now, once you start thinking
these thoughts,

00:23:24.678 --> 00:23:28.779
there's no need to restrict
yourself to emotions.

00:23:28.779 --> 00:23:33.531
The missing stuff,
the missing thing is there in

00:23:33.531 --> 00:23:38.079
all sorts of familiar humdrum
ways as well.

00:23:38.079 --> 00:23:41.250
So right now I'm looking at the
chairs in the auditorium.

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.500
They're some kind of shade of
blue.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.720
Think about--Look at some
places in the room where the

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.823
curtains with their red.
Think about what it's like to

00:23:51.823 --> 00:23:56.440
see red, the sensation of seeing
red.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:01.216
Now again, we've got to
distinguish between what I'll

00:24:01.216 --> 00:24:06.452
continue to call the behavioral
side of seeing red and the

00:24:06.452 --> 00:24:11.411
experiential side of seeing red.
It's easy enough for us to

00:24:11.411 --> 00:24:14.269
build a machine that can tell
red from blue.

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:17.676
It just checks and sees what
kind of light frequencies are

00:24:17.676 --> 00:24:21.502
bouncing off the object.
So we can build a machine that

00:24:21.502 --> 00:24:24.380
could sort red balls from blue
balls.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.769
My son has a little robot that
can do that.

00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:31.904
Still, when you think to
yourself, what's the--what's

00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:36.297
going on inside the machine?
What does it feel like to be

00:24:36.297 --> 00:24:40.528
the machine while it's looking
at--while it's got its little

00:24:40.528 --> 00:24:43.539
light sensors pointed at--the
red ball?

00:24:43.539 --> 00:24:48.210
Does it have the sensation of
seeing red?

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.363
What I suppose you want to say,
certainly what I want to say

00:24:51.363 --> 00:24:54.250
is, "No, no, it doesn't have
that sensation at all."

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:58.893
It's sorting things based on
the light frequencies,

00:24:58.893 --> 00:25:03.630
but it doesn't have the
experience of seeing red.

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.274
What we're trying to get at
here is--it can be very elusive,

00:25:06.274 --> 00:25:08.470
but I imagine most of you are
familiar with it.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:13.778
It's the sort of thing you
wonder about when you ask

00:25:13.778 --> 00:25:20.024
yourself, "If somebody was born
blind, could he possibly know

00:25:20.024 --> 00:25:25.918
what it's like to see color?"
He might be a scientist and

00:25:25.918 --> 00:25:30.289
know all sorts of things about
how light works.

00:25:30.289 --> 00:25:32.613
You use such and such
frequencies, and which objects,

00:25:32.613 --> 00:25:34.579
and you hand him an apple and
he'll say, "Oh,

00:25:34.579 --> 00:25:37.685
it must be very red," right?
Maybe he points his little

00:25:37.685 --> 00:25:40.200
light detector at it and it
reads out.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.049
It says, "This is such and such
a frequency."

00:25:42.049 --> 00:25:44.609
And he says,
"Oh, this is a very red apple,

00:25:44.609 --> 00:25:47.289
much redder than that tomato"
or whatever.

00:25:47.289 --> 00:25:49.617
But for all that,
we've got the notion,

00:25:49.617 --> 00:25:53.354
not only is he not seeing red,
he can't even imagine what it's

00:25:53.354 --> 00:25:56.968
like to see red,
never having had these

00:25:56.968 --> 00:26:00.577
experiences.
And once you start to see this,

00:26:00.577 --> 00:26:04.121
we realize, of course,
our life is filled with this

00:26:04.121 --> 00:26:06.350
aspect.
Things have colors.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.509
Things have sounds.
Things have smells.

00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:17.990
There is the qualitative aspect
of experience.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:20.214
And the point that I started
with earlier,

00:26:20.214 --> 00:26:23.362
about the internal aspect of
emotions, is it's not just out

00:26:23.362 --> 00:26:27.316
there, but inside as well.
We have certain kinds of

00:26:27.316 --> 00:26:32.938
sensations inside our body,
the characteristic sensation of

00:26:32.938 --> 00:26:36.910
fear or joy or depression.
All right.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:40.400
So the suggestion then might be
this.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:46.109
What no physical object can get
right, because no physical

00:26:46.109 --> 00:26:51.117
object can get at all,
is the qualitative aspect of

00:26:51.117 --> 00:26:54.688
experience.
That's the aspect that we're

00:26:54.688 --> 00:26:58.900
after when we ask ourselves,
"What's it like to see red?

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:06.230
What's it like to smell coffee
or to taste pineapple?"

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.907
Now, it's pretty--Philosophers
sometimes call these things

00:27:09.907 --> 00:27:12.616
qualia,
because of the notion of the

00:27:12.616 --> 00:27:16.528
qualitative aspects of things.
Our experiences have

00:27:16.528 --> 00:27:18.590
qualitative properties.

00:27:22.259 --> 00:27:28.444
And the suggestion then might
be, no physical object,

00:27:28.444 --> 00:27:35.700
no mere machine could possibly
have qualitative experience.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.200
But we've got it,
so we're no mere physical

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.440
object.
We're no mere machine.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.450
All right.
Now, that's the objection.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.059
It's a pretty good objection.
And then the question is,

00:27:50.059 --> 00:27:52.680
"What can the physicalist say
in response?"

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:58.574
Now, the best possible response
would be for the physicalist to

00:27:58.574 --> 00:28:04.183
say, "Here's how to build a
machine that can be conscious in

00:28:04.183 --> 00:28:08.275
this sense.
That is, have a qualitative

00:28:08.275 --> 00:28:10.460
experience.
Here's how to do it.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.163
Here's how to--Just like we can
explain in materialist,

00:28:14.163 --> 00:28:17.936
physicalist terms how to get
desires and beliefs and the

00:28:17.936 --> 00:28:21.984
behavioral stuff down,
here's how to get the feeling,

00:28:21.984 --> 00:28:25.079
qualitative aspect of things
down, too."

00:28:25.079 --> 00:28:28.882
It would be best if the
physicalist could give us that

00:28:28.882 --> 00:28:32.551
kind of story.
I think the truth of the matter

00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:35.966
has to be--I think the answer
right now is,

00:28:35.966 --> 00:28:39.220
we don't know how to give that
story.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:42.389
Consciousness,
if what we mean by

00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:47.639
consciousness is this
qualitative aspect of our mental

00:28:47.639 --> 00:28:52.890
life, consciousness remains a
pretty big mystery.

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:57.609
We don't know how to explain it
in physicalist terms.

00:28:57.609 --> 00:29:03.156
And it's because of that that I
think we shouldn't be dismissive

00:29:03.156 --> 00:29:06.589
of the dualist when the dualist
says,

00:29:06.589 --> 00:29:13.819
"We've got to believe in souls
in order to explain it."

00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:16.838
We shouldn't be dismissive,
but that's not to say that I

00:29:16.838 --> 00:29:18.540
think we should be convinced.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:28.414
Because it's one thing to say
we don't yet know how to explain

00:29:28.414 --> 00:29:34.598
consciousness in physical terms.
It's another thing to say we

00:29:34.598 --> 00:29:41.660
won't ever be able to explain
consciousness in physical terms.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:50.690
If we had the latter--excuse
me--If we had the bold claim

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:57.140
that no physical object could
see red,

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.920
taste honey,
then we'd have to conclude

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.945
since we can do all that,
we're not a physical object or

00:30:03.945 --> 00:30:08.232
not merely a physical object.
But I don't think we're yet in

00:30:08.232 --> 00:30:11.927
a position to say that.
I think the simple fact of the

00:30:11.927 --> 00:30:16.397
matter is we don't know enough
about consciousness yet to know

00:30:16.397 --> 00:30:20.500
whether or not it can be
explained in physical terms.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.737
When I think about this
situation, an analogy always

00:30:23.737 --> 00:30:27.351
occurs to me.
Imagine that we're somewhere

00:30:27.351 --> 00:30:31.438
in, let's say,
the fourteenth century trying

00:30:31.438 --> 00:30:35.430
to understand life,
the life of plants.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.657
A plant is a living thing.
And we ask ourselves,

00:30:39.657 --> 00:30:45.458
"Could it possibly be that life
could be explained in material

00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:47.562
terms?"
It's got to seem very

00:30:47.562 --> 00:30:49.470
mysterious to us.
How could it be?

00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.791
When we think of the kinds of
examples of material machines

00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:56.170
that we've got available to us
in the fourteenth century,

00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:00.146
I try to imagine what would
somebody in the fourteenth

00:31:00.146 --> 00:31:04.423
century think to himself or
herself when he entertains the

00:31:04.423 --> 00:31:08.400
possibility that a plant might
just be a machine?

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.394
And then, I have this little
image of some plant made out of

00:31:12.394 --> 00:31:15.556
gears, right?
And the gears begin turning and

00:31:15.556 --> 00:31:17.495
the bud opens,
dot, dot, dot,

00:31:17.495 --> 00:31:19.391
dot.
And the person's just going to

00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:22.230
say, "My god!
That wouldn't be alive!"

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:27.150
So it's pretty obvious that no
machine could be alive.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:28.750
No material object could be
alive.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:33.446
In order to explain life,
we have to appeal to something

00:31:33.446 --> 00:31:37.365
more than just atoms.
They didn't have atoms,

00:31:37.365 --> 00:31:41.462
but more than just matter.
Life requires something

00:31:41.462 --> 00:31:45.380
immaterial above and beyond
matter to explain it.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.418
That would have been an
understandable position to come

00:31:49.418 --> 00:31:53.980
to in the fourteenth century,
but it would have been wrong.

00:31:53.980 --> 00:32:01.446
We didn't have a clue back then
how to explain life in material

00:32:01.446 --> 00:32:04.698
terms.
But that didn't mean it

00:32:04.698 --> 00:32:09.377
couldn't be done.
I'm inclined to think the same

00:32:09.377 --> 00:32:14.190
thing is true right now for us
and consciousness.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.940
I know there are theories out
there.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.202
But my best take is we're
pretty much like in the

00:32:19.202 --> 00:32:22.138
fourteenth century.
We don't really have a clue

00:32:22.138 --> 00:32:25.156
yet, or not much of a clue,
as to how you could even so

00:32:25.156 --> 00:32:28.508
much as begin to--it's not that
merely that we don't have the

00:32:28.508 --> 00:32:32.411
details worked out.
We don't even have the picture

00:32:32.411 --> 00:32:36.937
in broad strokes as far as
consciousness is concerned,

00:32:36.937 --> 00:32:40.779
of how it could be done in
physical terms.

00:32:40.779 --> 00:32:47.990
But not seeing how it's
possible is not the same thing

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:55.393
as seeing that it's impossible.
If the dualist comes and says,

00:32:55.393 --> 00:33:00.539
"Can't you just see that it's
not remotely possible,

00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:05.511
it's not conceivably possible,
for a purely physical object to

00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:08.730
have experiences,
to have qualia?"

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.838
what I want to say is,
"No, I don't see that it's

00:33:11.838 --> 00:33:14.907
impossible.
I admit I don't see how to do

00:33:14.907 --> 00:33:18.210
it, but I don't see that it's
impossible."

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:23.000
So I don't feel forced to posit
the existence of a soul.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.958
Of course, the fan of the soul
could come back and say,

00:33:27.958 --> 00:33:32.052
"But that's not fair.
The question isn't,

00:33:32.052 --> 00:33:35.809
‘Is this explanation
impossible?'

00:33:35.809 --> 00:33:39.412
The question is just,
‘Who's got the better

00:33:39.412 --> 00:33:42.807
explanation?'
You guys can't offer any kind

00:33:42.807 --> 00:33:44.900
of explanation at all,
yet.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:50.270
I can offer an explanation.
How is consciousness possible?

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.878
We have souls.
Souls are really very different

00:33:53.878 --> 00:33:56.560
from physical objects and so
they can be conscious."

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.145
But at this point,
I think it's crucial to

00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:06.494
remember the point that it's not
just the question,

00:34:06.494 --> 00:34:09.947
"Who's got an explanation?"
but, "Who's got the better

00:34:09.947 --> 00:34:12.856
explanation?"
And before we say that the soul

00:34:12.856 --> 00:34:16.211
view's got the better
explanation, we have to ask

00:34:16.211 --> 00:34:19.818
ourselves,
just how much of an explanation

00:34:19.818 --> 00:34:22.430
is it to say,
"Oh I can explain

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:25.534
consciousness.
Consciousness is housed not in

00:34:25.534 --> 00:34:27.750
the body, but in the soul."
Okay.

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:30.500
"How exactly is it that a soul
can be conscious?"

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.529
we ask.
And then the soul theorist

00:34:34.529 --> 00:34:37.144
says, "Well, uhm..
er..

00:34:37.144 --> 00:34:39.639
ah..
it just can."

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.539
That's not really much of an
explanation.

00:34:42.539 --> 00:34:47.623
I don't feel I've got any sort
of account going here as to how

00:34:47.623 --> 00:34:51.789
consciousness works,
even if I become a dualist.

00:34:51.789 --> 00:34:54.739
If the dualist were to start
offering us some elaborate

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:57.411
theory of consciousness,
"Well, there's these sorts of

00:34:57.411 --> 00:34:59.095
soul structures,
and those sorts of soul

00:34:59.095 --> 00:35:00.722
structures,
and these create these

00:35:00.722 --> 00:35:02.860
sensations and those create
those sensations.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:07.077
And here's a theory," well,
then, I'll begin to take it

00:35:07.077 --> 00:35:11.372
seriously as an explanation.
But if all the soul theorist is

00:35:11.372 --> 00:35:13.010
just saying is "Nah,
nah.

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:17.177
You guys can't explain it and I
can, because I say this is an

00:35:17.177 --> 00:35:19.588
explanation."
then, I find myself wanting to

00:35:19.588 --> 00:35:21.230
say, "That's not really any
better.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:24.534
That's no improvement at all."
There was a question or a

00:35:24.534 --> 00:35:33.994
comment.
Student: [inaudible]

00:35:33.994 --> 00:35:46.320
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Good.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.205
So the question was--First,
it was the accusation before

00:35:49.205 --> 00:35:51.250
the question,
that I'm holding a sort of

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:53.647
double standard.
I'm defending,

00:35:53.647 --> 00:35:59.230
I'm defending the physicalist
by saying, "Don't blame us.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.889
We don't know how to explain it
yet."

00:36:02.889 --> 00:36:05.941
Why aren't I allowing the soul
theory to say,

00:36:05.941 --> 00:36:10.742
"Don't blame us.
We don't know how to explain it

00:36:10.742 --> 00:36:13.099
yet."
Good question.

00:36:13.099 --> 00:36:17.320
And my answer is--And sometimes
I think this one's a tie.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.110
I think the soul theorist
doesn't have an explanation.

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:25.710
The physical theorist doesn't
have an explanation.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.166
As far as I can see,
right now nobody's got a good

00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:32.269
explanation about how
consciousness works.

00:36:32.269 --> 00:36:36.670
It's a bit of a mystery right
now.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.949
So I don't mean--I hope I
haven't been doing this.

00:36:38.949 --> 00:36:41.211
It's not so much a double
standard is needed;

00:36:41.211 --> 00:36:43.668
it's a tie.
But notice if it's a tie,

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:47.030
that doesn't give us what we
were looking for.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.543
What we were looking for,
after all, was some reason to

00:36:50.543 --> 00:36:52.916
believe in souls.
And if the best the soul

00:36:52.916 --> 00:36:55.332
theorist can say is,
"I can't explain it and neither

00:36:55.332 --> 00:36:57.890
can you," that's not a reason to
believe this side.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.389
We already believe there are
bodies.

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:10.059
We already know bodies can do
some pretty amazing things.

00:37:10.059 --> 00:37:15.312
The question we're asking is,
"Is there a good reason to add

00:37:15.312 --> 00:37:20.122
to our list of things there are?
Is there a good reason to add

00:37:20.122 --> 00:37:24.362
the soul, something immaterial?"
And if the best that the soul

00:37:24.362 --> 00:37:27.873
theorist has is,
"maybe we need this to explain

00:37:27.873 --> 00:37:32.070
something that I don't see how
you guys can explain,

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:34.342
maybe this would help,
though I can't quite see how

00:37:34.342 --> 00:37:36.570
either," that's not a very
compelling argument.

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:43.853
So what I'm inclined to think
with regard to this particular

00:37:43.853 --> 00:37:47.531
strand or this particular
version of the argument is,

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:51.015
the jury's still out.
Maybe at the end of the day

00:37:51.015 --> 00:37:54.273
we'll give it our best.
We'll decide you can't explain

00:37:54.273 --> 00:37:58.537
consciousness in physical terms.
We'll begin to work out some

00:37:58.537 --> 00:38:01.820
sort of alternative immaterial
theory.

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.949
Maybe at the end of the day we
will decide we need to believe

00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:05.627
in souls.
But right now,

00:38:05.627 --> 00:38:10.500
I don't think the evidence
supports that conclusion.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.590
Still, there's other
possibilities.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.228
Consider creativity.
Here's another version of an

00:38:20.228 --> 00:38:22.064
argument that goes from
inference to the best

00:38:22.064 --> 00:38:23.619
explanation.
Creativity.

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:27.990
It says, "People can be
creative."

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:31.380
We write new pieces of music.
We write poems.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.438
We prove things in mathematics
that have never been proven

00:38:34.438 --> 00:38:37.498
before or we find new ways to
prove these theorems or what

00:38:37.498 --> 00:38:43.090
have you and we can be creative.
No mere machine can be creative.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.210
So we must be something more
than a mere machine.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:56.321
Well, then, the question is
going to be, "Could it be a case

00:38:56.321 --> 00:39:00.690
that there could be a physical
object that's creative?"

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.460
And I'm inclined to think,
"Yes."

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.242
In fact, I already suggested as
much when I talked about the

00:39:05.242 --> 00:39:09.809
chess-playing computers.
The chess-playing computer

00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:15.608
programs think of moves,
think of strategies no one's

00:39:15.608 --> 00:39:20.059
thought of before.
In the most straightforward

00:39:20.059 --> 00:39:24.356
natural meaning of the term,
we have to say--I think the

00:39:24.356 --> 00:39:29.199
program that beat the world
champion was called Deep Fritz.

00:39:29.199 --> 00:39:33.559
So when Deep Fritz beat
Kramnik, it was being creative.

00:39:33.559 --> 00:39:35.397
It made a move that Kramnik
didn't think of and perhaps

00:39:35.397 --> 00:39:37.460
nobody had.
Perhaps no chess game before

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.560
had had this move.

00:39:42.969 --> 00:39:46.119
Computers can do other sorts of
things of this sort.

00:39:46.119 --> 00:39:53.239
There are mathematical
theorem-proving programs.

00:39:53.239 --> 00:39:55.269
Now, some of these things can
prove things that are

00:39:55.269 --> 00:39:58.336
mathematically way over my head.
But let's take something simple

00:39:58.336 --> 00:40:01.436
like the Pythagorean Theorem,
which we all learned in high

00:40:01.436 --> 00:40:04.119
school.
And we learned how to prove the

00:40:04.119 --> 00:40:08.190
Pythagorean Theorem in Euclidean
geometry, starting with the

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.950
various axioms in Euclidean
geometry,

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:14.489
ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba bum.
This proves Pythagorean Theorem.

00:40:14.489 --> 00:40:17.733
And it turns out there's a
variety of proofs of the

00:40:17.733 --> 00:40:20.188
Pythagorean Theorem.
And, in fact,

00:40:20.188 --> 00:40:23.985
a computer program has come up
with a proof that,

00:40:23.985 --> 00:40:27.782
as far as was known,
nobody in the world had ever

00:40:27.782 --> 00:40:31.887
come up with before.
Well, other than prejudice,

00:40:31.887 --> 00:40:36.849
what would stop us from saying
the program was being creative?

00:40:36.849 --> 00:40:40.065
Not just in sort of
mathematical things like chess

00:40:40.065 --> 00:40:42.099
or math, there are,
as you know,

00:40:42.099 --> 00:40:46.325
programs that can write music.
And I don't just mean throw out

00:40:46.325 --> 00:40:51.368
some random assortment of notes.
Programs that can produce music

00:40:51.368 --> 00:40:56.547
that have--that we recognize as
music, that have melodic

00:40:56.547 --> 00:41:03.380
structure and develop themes,
resolve, music that nobody's

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.525
heard before.
Why not say the machine is

00:41:08.525 --> 00:41:12.273
creative?
What, other than prejudice,

00:41:12.273 --> 00:41:17.398
would stop us from saying that?
So if the argument's going to

00:41:17.398 --> 00:41:21.565
be, "We need to posit the
existence of a soul in order to

00:41:21.565 --> 00:41:25.510
explain creativity," again,
that just seems wrong.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.940
Well, there's a--question,
comment?

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:39.500
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:41.800
Good.
The question was,

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.805
"When I talk about creativity
here, am I trying to build in

00:41:44.805 --> 00:41:47.862
some appeal to the feeling that
we may have when we're being

00:41:47.862 --> 00:41:49.889
creative?"
And the answer is, "No."

00:41:49.889 --> 00:41:51.651
All I had in mind,
as you know,

00:41:51.651 --> 00:41:55.232
is just--in talking about the
creativity issue--I just have in

00:41:55.232 --> 00:41:58.878
mind producing something new,
producing something that hasn't

00:41:58.878 --> 00:42:01.593
been around before.
And most particularly,

00:42:01.593 --> 00:42:05.993
producing something that your
programmers didn't already have

00:42:05.993 --> 00:42:08.787
in mind.
Remember, it's not as though

00:42:08.787 --> 00:42:12.904
the people who designed the
chess-playing programs can beat

00:42:12.904 --> 00:42:16.708
it.
The chess-playing program makes

00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:20.740
moves these guys haven't thought
of.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.787
All right.
The creativity argument may not

00:42:23.787 --> 00:42:28.260
work, but there's something that
sort of immediately comes on its

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.719
heels.
Even if we could build a

00:42:30.719 --> 00:42:35.369
program, even if we had built
programs that can be creative,

00:42:35.369 --> 00:42:40.594
that can do things that
nobody's thought of before,

00:42:40.594 --> 00:42:45.715
all the program is doing is
following its program,

00:42:45.715 --> 00:42:50.059
right?
It's just a series of lines of

00:42:50.059 --> 00:42:53.401
code.
And the robot or the computer

00:42:53.401 --> 00:42:56.914
or what have you is just
automatically,

00:42:56.914 --> 00:43:02.370
mechanically following the code
commands of the program.

00:43:06.159 --> 00:43:09.805
We might say,
even if we are smart enough to

00:43:09.805 --> 00:43:14.213
build programs that can,
by mechanistically following

00:43:14.213 --> 00:43:18.205
the program,
do things we've never thought

00:43:18.205 --> 00:43:23.385
of, still all the computer can
do, all the robot can do is

00:43:23.385 --> 00:43:26.487
automatically,
necessarily,

00:43:26.487 --> 00:43:30.770
mechanically follow the
program.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:39.900
It doesn't have free will.
But we have free will.

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:45.180
So, here's a new argument for
the existence of the soul.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:53.447
People have free will.
No merely mechanical object,

00:43:53.447 --> 00:44:00.829
no robot, no computer could
have free will.

00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:06.333
But since we've got free will,
we must be something more than

00:44:06.333 --> 00:44:12.384
a merely physical object.
There must be something extra,

00:44:12.384 --> 00:44:17.269
something immaterial about us,
the soul.

00:44:17.269 --> 00:44:22.846
So maybe that's why we need to
believe in souls in order to

00:44:22.846 --> 00:44:26.512
explain free will.
Now, the subject,

00:44:26.512 --> 00:44:30.713
free will, is a very,
very--The subject of

00:44:30.713 --> 00:44:34.710
consciousness is a very
complicated.

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:38.082
One could have an entire
semester devoted to thinking

00:44:38.082 --> 00:44:41.389
about the philosophical problem
of consciousness.

00:44:41.389 --> 00:44:44.684
And indeed, as it happens,
in our department this very

00:44:44.684 --> 00:44:47.916
semester there is such a class
devoted, all semester,

00:44:47.916 --> 00:44:52.979
to the topic of consciousness.
One could similarly have a

00:44:52.979 --> 00:44:57.969
course devoted to the problem of
free will.

00:44:57.969 --> 00:45:01.329
I'm going to spend all of two
minutes on it.

00:45:01.329 --> 00:45:03.147
So it's by no means do I mean
to suggest, "Oh,

00:45:03.147 --> 00:45:05.409
here's everything you need to
know about the subject."

00:45:05.409 --> 00:45:10.756
I simply want to point out
enough about the problem to help

00:45:10.756 --> 00:45:16.010
you see why I don't think free
will is a slam-dunk for the

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:17.880
soul.
So what's the argument?

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:20.250
Well, the thought seems to be
something like this.

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:30.860
One, we have free will.

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.159
Two--let me say something about
this.

00:45:37.159 --> 00:45:39.852
What is it about the thought
that the computer is just

00:45:39.852 --> 00:45:42.125
following a program?
Well, the thought,

00:45:42.125 --> 00:45:44.501
I suppose is,
in philosopher's jargon,

00:45:44.501 --> 00:45:47.519
that the computer is a
deterministic system.

00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:51.845
It follows the laws of physics
and the laws of physics are

00:45:51.845 --> 00:45:54.408
deterministic.
If you're in this state,

00:45:54.408 --> 00:45:57.218
you will necessarily,
given the laws of physics and

00:45:57.218 --> 00:45:59.971
the way the computer's
programmed and built and so

00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:01.977
forth,
these wires will turn on,

00:46:01.977 --> 00:46:04.585
turn off, these circuits will
turn on, turn off,

00:46:04.585 --> 00:46:07.149
boom,
suddenly you'll be in that

00:46:07.149 --> 00:46:08.920
state.
There are certain laws such

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:10.922
that, given that the computer's
in this state,

00:46:10.922 --> 00:46:12.789
it must necessarily move in
that state.

00:46:12.789 --> 00:46:17.122
When you've got a view about
cause and effect that works this

00:46:17.122 --> 00:46:19.650
way--for everything that
happens,

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.946
there's some earlier thing that
caused it to happen such that

00:46:23.946 --> 00:46:29.312
given that earlier cause,
the event had to follow--that's

00:46:29.312 --> 00:46:33.214
a deterministic picture.
And the thought,

00:46:33.214 --> 00:46:37.612
of course, is that the robot or
the computer is a deterministic

00:46:37.612 --> 00:46:41.868
system and you can't have free
will if you're a deterministic

00:46:41.868 --> 00:46:44.760
system.
So number one,

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:54.250
we have free will.
Two, nothing subject to

00:46:54.250 --> 00:47:02.140
determinism has free will.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:11.248
Put one and two together.
It follows, if nothing subject

00:47:11.248 --> 00:47:14.883
to determinism has free will,
but we have free will,

00:47:14.883 --> 00:47:18.590
it follows that we're not
subject to determinism.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:28.585
Suppose we then add three,
all purely physical systems are

00:47:28.585 --> 00:47:32.970
subject to determinism.

00:47:44.179 --> 00:47:47.789
Well, one and two gave us that
we are not subject to

00:47:47.789 --> 00:47:50.528
determinism.
Three says, all purely physical

00:47:50.528 --> 00:47:52.559
systems are subject to
determinism.

00:47:52.559 --> 00:47:57.480
Well, it would follow then from
one, two, and three that we are

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:03.227
not a purely physical system.
So, conclusion,

00:48:03.227 --> 00:48:12.650
four, we are not a purely
physical system.

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.860
All right.
That's the argument from free

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:25.039
will.
Now, the argument is valid.

00:48:25.039 --> 00:48:28.443
That's philosopher's jargon,
that is to say,

00:48:28.443 --> 00:48:32.479
given the three premises,
the conclusion really does

00:48:32.479 --> 00:48:35.841
follow.
The interesting question is,

00:48:35.841 --> 00:48:41.329
"Are the three premises true?"
And they've got to all be true.

00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:46.360
It's got to be that every
single one of them is so.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.380
I'll just spend a minute more
on this starting next time.

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.547
But the point to think about
for next time is just,

00:48:54.547 --> 00:48:58.159
is it really true that all
three of the premises are true,

00:48:58.159 --> 00:49:00.820
or might one or more of them be
false?

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.545
All right.
That's where we'll start next

00:49:03.545 --> 00:49:04.545
time.

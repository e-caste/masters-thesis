00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:07.900
I want to begin with a very
brief quote by an individual

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.667
who takes up some
important space towards the,

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:16.100
towards the end
of the lecture.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.600
This is by former U.S.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000
representative
Shirley Chisholm,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.167
and she says,
"The emotional,

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:28.500
sexual, and psychological
stereotyping of female

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.500
begins when the doctor
says 'It's a girl.'" Now

00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:45.667
throughout the course, in
an underlying sort of way,

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:47.000
every now and again,
we've been talking about,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.100
in a variety of
different ways,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.900
gender dynamics in
the American scene,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.167
whether it's the strange
intermarriage--interesting

00:00:57.167 --> 00:01:00.367
choice of
words--of race and,

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:05.600
and sex and gender, when it
comes to the figure of the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.800
black male rapist, or
the black male brute,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.200
and white womanhood,
vaunted womanhood.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.767
And certainly we've been
hearing from our primary

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:19.300
sources especially, a range
of different women writers

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.100
and thinkers and activists.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.000
Today I want to spend a lot
of the lecture focusing on,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.800
on this particular moment
in the early 1970s where you

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.600
have a very modern
articulation of a new black

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.600
feminism.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.367
So as you've been hearing
from me in the last several

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:44.700
lectures, it almost
sounds like a drumbeat,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.667
I realize, that this
is a complicated area.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.800
There's a lot of strife,
there's a lot of confusion.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.767
Well, the fact
simply is that it,

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:53.800
that it is, and as
this lecture's covering

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.767
essentially the mid-1960s
up to the mid-1970s,

00:01:55.767 --> 00:02:00.167
as we get into
the 1970s, there's,

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:03.467
there's no radical
change in the idea of social

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.000
complication.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.467
It's a period of
profound unrest in the U.S.

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:11.067
The economic up--euphoria
of the 1960s--something I

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:12.900
didn't mention: the
economy's booming.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.967
I mean, this is part of the,
the angry--the anger you

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:20.567
hear in Gil Scott-Heron, in
his spoken word performance,

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:21.900
"Whitey on the Moon."

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.567
It's like, we're spending
all this money sending--I

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:27.500
mean it's expensive to
pers--put a person on the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.200
moon, as it turns out.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.500
Yet in black America, we're
not seeing any of this,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.800
this kind of benefit.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800
So the sixties are a period
of incredible economic

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.700
prosperity for many
parts of the United States.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.000
For many black
urban dwellers,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.100
though, it's
something quite different.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.600
When you get into
the 1970s, though,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.300
the economic
euphoria vanishes,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.200
and a new fiscal
reality sets in that,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.900
that, that forces
economists to think,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.600
to rethink old
working models.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.100
You know things are supposed
to act in a certain way.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.267
My goodness, they're not
acting in a certain way.

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:00.567
And they actually
coined a phrase,

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:04.100
a term for the new economic
problems of the mid- and the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.100
late-1970s.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.800
That phrase is stagflation.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.400
In a stagnant economy,
according to the models,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.200
means that you're not
going to have inflation.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.000
In fact, you
might have deflation.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.900
But you had a stagnant
economy and inflation,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.800
and it's something that just
hadn't happened before and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.900
it sort of defied
a lot of the--of,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.000
of logic, but, you know,
this is what happens when

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.700
new logic
models are proposed.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.400
So fiscally, the country's
heading into a wreck.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.467
It's also a period of
psychological trauma as far

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:39.667
as the mythological,
mythological purity of

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:43.100
America was concerned,
the atrocities of war,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.800
and there's
always atrocities,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.467
but now they're being
brought home for the first

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:49.800
time via the media's close
involvement in the war,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.000
with the war in Vietnam.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.167
I mean, you have cameras,
what we now--what we would

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:56.900
now call them?,
embedded, you know,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.900
journalists.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.367
You had cameras
in the field,

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:04.867
you--video and film, and the
images are coming back on

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:09.000
the nightly news, something
that we don't see any more,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
frankly.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That, that has
been shut down.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.400
And it's been shut
down because it was very

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.167
effective at
spreading dismay or anxiety,

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.700
what the heck we are
doing over in Vietnam.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.200
Why do our young men keep
coming home in body bags?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600
So with a
heightened media presence,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.200
means you can't hide
the fact that America's

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.267
overwhelming military
power found itself almost

00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:38.100
irrelevant in the
face of North Vietnamese

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.100
determination.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.000
The war is not going well,
as you get into the late

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.100
sixties and into
the early seventies.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.600
You have a sitting president
in the late sixties,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.500
LBJ, who declines to run
for a second term in office.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.967
A shocking moment.

00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:58.500
You know, he took over
when JFK was assassinated,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.400
won a first election, then
had a chance to run for a

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.400
second, and said no.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.000
The Republican
Party, under Nixon,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.767
takes control with a
pledge to the South,

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:14.367
I mentioned in a
previous lecture,

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:17.700
with Strom Thurmond, that
is going to ignore the civil

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.000
rights gains of the
preceding decade.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.900
Nixon runs on a law
and order campaign.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.700
Actually, a few of you
came to Kathleen Cleaver's

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.100
presentation last night, and
she said something that's

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.767
really quite striking,
and I've heard it from many

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:30.800
different people.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.367
And you'll, you'll hear it
from me in a different way I

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:35.000
suppose later on in this
course in the time that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.800
remains, is that you
look for those people like

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.900
Kathleen Cleaver who were
adults during Nixon's era.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.067
This is like, you know, the
country can't get any worse

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:46.700
as far as
presidential leadership.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.467
But you look back
at--[Student sneezes] Bless

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:53.500
you--at the, at, at the
Republican party politics

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.867
under, under Nixon, and the
country has shifted very far

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:00.167
to the right, the
arbitrary right,

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:03.200
in terms of being much more
conservative politically,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.500
that from the standpoint
of many different political

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.500
projects, Nixon is sounding
really quite progressive in

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.600
many areas
compared to--you know,

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.900
it doesn't matter
who's in the office,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.800
Republican or Democrat.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.200
Clinton was a conservative
Republican and Obama's a

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200
moderate--excuse me.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.900
What did I
say?--conservative Democrat

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.900
and, and Obama's a
moderate Democrat,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.900
and Nixon on many issues,
they had--they were on the

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.500
same page, where Nixon was
a little bit more liberal.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.500
It's, it's a weird
kind of thing to say,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.900
but this is the record.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.000
In any event,
Nixon's now in office,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.200
running under a law
and order campaign,

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.500
having gotten
into office under,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.467
running, running underneath
a law and order campaign.

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:49.900
But he's not in office
that long when the country's

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.800
growing skepticism
about its elected officials

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.600
intensifies, once it
learns about the break-in,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.600
break-ins at the Watergate,
and the extent to which the

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600
cover ups were orchestrated
by the White House,

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.767
by Nixon himself.

00:07:03.767 --> 00:07:06.567
It's actually funny.

00:07:06.567 --> 00:07:08.967
This is around--I
was born in 1967,

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:12.500
and I remember watching
live TV and thinking--well,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.700
I thought Nixon
was the guy on the,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.700
on the dime.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:15.800
I didn't realize it was
a different President,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.200
but the guy that looked
like the guy on the dime,

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.900
I knew he was in trouble.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.000
I didn't know what he did,
and it was too much for my

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.400
small brain to
accommodate at the time,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.600
but my first political
memory is of the impeachment

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.767
hearings, dealing
with, with Richard Nixon.

00:07:29.767 --> 00:07:31.200
People were
fixated on the TV,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.500
what is the
Congress going to do?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.267
So growing out
of this moment,

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:38.967
we're talking here
the early 1970s,

00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:43.600
the economy begins to tank,
the military is humiliated,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.700
the political process
becomes tainted at the

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.500
highest levels
and the country's,

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.767
in a sense, is lost.

00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:52.900
Now many African Americans
felt for a very long time

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.500
that the
country's innocence has,

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.967
had been lost long
before the 1970s.

00:07:56.967 --> 00:07:59.667
Black women in particular
had an acute sense of

00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:02.067
disdain at the country's
pronouncements about

00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:04.800
equality before the law
and then the promise of the

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.800
civil rights movement.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.000
Black women suffer from what
they called double jeopardy,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.367
being black and
being female.

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:13.100
Citizenship twice denied.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.667
For too long,
freedom was equated with,

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:21.100
in as far as the African
American community is

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.300
concerned, is equated
with black manhood and the

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.200
freedom of blacks, with
the redemption of black

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.700
masculinity.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.700
If we can help our brothers,
then we'll all be free.

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:34.900
Elaine Brown becomes the
leader of the Black Panther

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.967
Party in the early 1970s,
once the founding leadership

00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:41.000
is either
jailed, kicked out,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.300
or in exile.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.700
Elaine Brown recalled an
organizational meeting when

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.700
she and other women were
forced to wait to eat until

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.700
the men were served food
for which they all had

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.100
contributed.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.800
The eth--ethos of
the time was that,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.467
quote, this is Elaine
Brown speaking here,

00:08:58.467 --> 00:09:00.600
"Sisters do not
challenge brothers.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.900
Sisters stood
behind their black men,

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.000
supported their men,
and respected them."

00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:09.767
So even in a vanguard
organization like the Black

00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:12.400
Panthers, a group that
called for political and

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.900
economic reorientation in
American life and values,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.900
good, old-fashioned
sexism is alive and well.

00:09:19.967 --> 00:09:23.300
Sexism of course is nothing
new to the American scene.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.500
What was new was a rising
articulation of modern

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.600
feminism that is built upon
the emotional power of the

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.500
civil rights movement.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.600
I imagine you've heard it
many times before that you

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:37.267
look at the great
changes in women's politics,

00:09:37.267 --> 00:09:39.200
Chicano,
Lat--Latino politics,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.000
Asian America
politics, LGBTQ politics,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.900
they're growing out of the
organizational skills really

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.800
mastered by civil
rights activists,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.400
women's, women's
movement being the most,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.800
the earliest sort of,
quote, other movement,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.600
building upon models of the
civil rights movement with

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.300
great success.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:06.500
In 1963, Betty Friedan
published The Feminine

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.600
Mystique.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.267
It became a
tremendously important book,

00:10:11.267 --> 00:10:13.900
and it was essentially
about how to get white,

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.267
middle-class women out
of the home and into the

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:18.267
workplace.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.400
Without diminishing the
importance of the book,

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.600
it's, it's a landmark book.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.367
For black women,
the book seemed,

00:10:25.367 --> 00:10:27.400
from sort of an
argumentative standpoint,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.000
largely irrelevant, because
black women had always been

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.400
out of the home, in someone
else's home actually,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.500
often as domestics.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.567
But they didn't have the
leisure and the opportunity

00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:42.100
to be at home in a way that
white middle-class women

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.100
did.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.100
It's from an
economic standpoint.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.667
So The Feminine
Mys--Mystique is one of the

00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:53.400
first volleys of what
will become sort of modern

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.400
feminist movement, and
right at the very beginning,

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.967
black women are wondering,
"Well where--How does this

00:10:56.967 --> 00:10:58.400
book apply to
my experience?"

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.300
A couple of
years later in 1965,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.767
black women and their sense
of being ignored by major

00:11:05.767 --> 00:11:11.767
currents in American society
are turned on its head in a

00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:14.367
weird way when they
find themselves with the

00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:16.500
spotlight turned on them.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.367
Black women used
to being ignored,

00:11:18.367 --> 00:11:19.900
and now the
spotlight's on them,

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.267
only this time they're not
being blamed--only this time

00:11:21.267 --> 00:11:26.100
they're being
blamed, excuse me,

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.500
for black
America's failures.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.767
At that moment,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan,

00:11:30.767 --> 00:11:35.367
future senator, then part
of the Department of Labor,

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:38.500
published a report called
The Negro Family: The Case

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.500
for National Action.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.467
The report had charted black
life in the United States.

00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:45.100
It spoke about the
economic, political,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.167
and social deprivations
that grew out of slavery and

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:51.067
explored how being a
disadvantaged minority

00:11:51.067 --> 00:11:54.867
affected the black
family structure.

00:11:54.867 --> 00:11:57.400
Today, it's a tremendously
important report,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.800
and it sets welfare policy
standards for the next

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.467
generation.

00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:03.400
I want to reduce the report
to its simplest and most

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.800
controversial essence.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.900
Although
Moynihan lamented it,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.267
he said he felt that, he
felt that there was nothing,

00:12:10.267 --> 00:12:13.067
nothing else to do but
conclude that blacks were

00:12:13.067 --> 00:12:15.200
caught in a, quote,
"tangle of pathology."

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.800
It's an important phrase.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.667
This tangle, moreover, was
a result of women-headed

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:23.700
households in black America.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.767
To illustrate this logic,
I'm going to quote from the

00:12:26.767 --> 00:12:30.400
text, and I want you to
listen here for the very

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.800
clear investment in the
norm of patriarchy here.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.600
Moynihan writes: "That the
Negro American has survived

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.200
at all is extraordinary--a
lesser people might simply

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.100
have died out, as
indeed others have.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.100
That the Negro community
has not only survived,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.167
but in this political
generation has entered

00:12:50.167 --> 00:12:52.000
national affairs
as a moderate,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.767
humane, and constructive
national force is the

00:12:54.767 --> 00:12:57.200
highest testament to
the healing powers of the

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.767
democratic ideal and the
creative vitality of the

00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:02.300
negro people.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.300
But it may not be supposed
that the Negro American

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.600
community has not paid
a fearful price for the

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:10.300
incredible mistreatment to
which it has been subjected

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:12.700
over the past
three centuries.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.200
In essence, the Negro
community has been forced

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.500
into a matriarchal
structure which,

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.467
because it is so out of
line with the rest of the

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:22.867
American society, seriously
retards the progress of the

00:13:22.867 --> 00:13:26.200
group as a whole, and
imposes a crushing burden on

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.400
the Negro male
and, in consequence,

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.367
on a great many
Negro women as well.

00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:34.667
There is, presumably,
no special place--no,

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:37.767
excuse me, no special reason
why a society in which males

00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:39.900
are dominant in family
relationships is to be

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.700
preferred to a
matriarchal arrangement.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.267
However, it is clearly a
disadvantage for a minority

00:13:45.267 --> 00:13:48.000
group to be
operating on one principle,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.967
while the great
majority of the population,

00:13:49.967 --> 00:13:52.200
and the one with the most
advantages to begin with,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.700
is operating on another.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.300
This is the present
situation of the Negro.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.400
Ours is a society which
presumes male leadership in

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.267
private and public affairs.

00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:05.200
The arrangements of society
facilitate such leadership

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.600
and reward it.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.700
A subculture, such as
that of the Negro American,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.200
in which this is not--in
which this is not the

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.900
pattern, is placed at a
distinct disadvantage.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:17.600
Here an earlier word
of caution is--should,

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.267
should be repeated.

00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:22.567
There is much evidence that
a considerable amount--There

00:14:22.567 --> 00:14:24.667
is much evidence that a
considerable number of Negro

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:26.767
families have managed to
break out of the tangle of

00:14:26.767 --> 00:14:29.500
pathology and to establish
themselves as stable,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.900
effective units, living
according to patterns of

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.900
American
society in general."

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:41.500
This is one excerpt
from a much larger study,

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:47.567
of course, and this is
coming from an old-fashioned

00:14:47.567 --> 00:14:51.300
Democrat, an old--a, a great
liberal in the American

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.067
tradition, lamenting the
destruction of the black

00:14:55.067 --> 00:14:58.867
family, pointing to the
fact that its matriarchal

00:14:58.867 --> 00:15:00.800
structure, the
women-headed households,

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.300
is the real reason behind,
behind blacks' inability to

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.300
have successful
family units,

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.167
because it's so out of line
with the national norm of

00:15:09.167 --> 00:15:11.167
male-headed households.

00:15:13.067 --> 00:15:15.800
You know, it's great that
blacks are so--have such

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800
strong backbones, they've
been able to survive so much

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.767
degradation, but we've got
to find a way to solve this

00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:21.900
problem.

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.900
It is a call for
national action,

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:26.967
which is the subtitle, The
Case for National Action,

00:15:26.967 --> 00:15:28.600
the subtitle of the report.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.500
We need to solve the problem
of the structure of the

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.500
black family.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.200
Black Americans are outraged
by the report and its claim

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.200
of an almost
organic dysfunctionalism.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.667
This is not an anger that
sought to deny the very

00:15:45.667 --> 00:15:49.267
obvious reality of poverty
in the black community.

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:52.200
No one could deny that.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.267
And also this anger is not a
direct manifestation of the

00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:57.367
failure of
Johnson's Great Society,

00:15:57.367 --> 00:16:00.300
and King's civil rights
strategies to address

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.300
abiding problems of poverty.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:06.000
People recognize the efforts
that are being made in these

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.967
regards.

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:11.867
The anger is really a
result of being considered a

00:16:11.867 --> 00:16:15.000
problem that America, and
especially white America,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
had to solve.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.967
I mean think of this moment.

00:16:17.967 --> 00:16:19.300
This is the moment
we're talking about.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.067
Moynihan's report
comes out in '65.

00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:23.900
Stokely Carmichael is
talking about Black Power in

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.300
'66, and while
Stokely Carmichael and,

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.567
and his fellow travelers
are a minority within black

00:16:29.567 --> 00:16:33.100
America, they're still
getting a lot of attention,

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.767
far more attention than
their actual numbers would

00:16:34.767 --> 00:16:36.600
suggest.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.967
And to suggest--to hear then
from an important figure in

00:16:39.967 --> 00:16:42.100
the federal
government, saying,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:43.967
you know, "White Americans
really have to solve this

00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:44.967
problem for black Americans.

00:16:44.967 --> 00:16:49.467
We need to find a solution,"
and sort of saying,

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:50.467
you know, "It's
really too bad,

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:53.000
we've also been
part of the problem,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.267
but we really can't
address that issue.

00:16:57.267 --> 00:17:01.367
Let's try to fix
this black family,

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:04.400
 just outraged
black, black Americans.

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.800
So according to Moynihan,
blacks are a problem that

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.267
white America
had to resolve.

00:17:11.267 --> 00:17:12.767
Now you may or may
not be surprised,

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:15.000
as I've talked in this
course about connections to

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.267
events decades earlier
and the way in which things

00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:19.700
don't change at times.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.900
You may not be
surprised that W.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.900
E.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.900
B.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.100
Du Bois, having just passed
away two years earlier,

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.100
said as much the
same thing in 1903,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.200
when he offered the
following words in his

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.000
landmark book, The
Souls of Black Folk.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.400
And Du Bois said, "Between
me and the other world there

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.200
is an ever unasked question:
unasked by some through

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.000
feelings of delicacy;
by others through the

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.400
difficulty of
rightly framing it.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.367
All, nevertheless,
flutter around it.

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:52.800
They approach me in a
half-hesitant sort of way,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.967
eye me curiously
or compassionately,

00:17:54.967 --> 00:17:56.900
and then, instead
of saying directly,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.700
'How does it feel to be
a problem?' they say,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.500
'I know an excellent
colored man in my town;

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.967
 or, 'Do not these southern
outrages make you--make your

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:08.167
blood boil?' At
these I smile,

00:18:08.167 --> 00:18:11.700
or am interested, or reduce
the boiling to a simmer,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.967
as the occasion may require.

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:17.100
To the real question,
'How does it feel to be a

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.800
problem?' I
answer seldom a word."

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.800
This is a
different age, 1965.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.267
This is a different age
than Du Bois's in 1903.

00:18:27.267 --> 00:18:31.100
And instead of silence,
black women begin to be

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.300
heard on these kinds of
issues that Moynihan's

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.400
raising.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.200
Now please note, I'm not
saying they begin to speak

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200
up.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.300
They're
beginning to be heard.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.700
In the wake of the
Moynihan Report,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.867
groups across the country,
individuals and groups,

00:18:47.867 --> 00:18:49.200
galvanize into action.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.600
There's a huge amount of
scholarship published in the

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.667
wake of the Moynihan Report,
in response to the Moynihan

00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:56.900
Report, dealing with the
sociology of the black

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:00.400
family and, sort of,
so-called black sociology.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.967
But on the activist front,
people are outraged by sort

00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:10.100
of the blinders on Daniel
Patrick Moynihan's opinions

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.500
or thoughts or analyses,
start forming groups of

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.700
their own, and one of the
key players in this process

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.167
was a woman named
Johnnie Tillman,

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:23.867
a black woman, who had
been on welfare herself,

00:19:23.867 --> 00:19:25.900
who helped organize
the National Welfare

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.967
Organization, the NWRO.

00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:33.967
Tillman becomes one of the
galvanizing figures of the

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.100
NWRO, and really one
of its spokespersons.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:47.000
Tillman defined poverty as
the defining element in the

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.067
lives of black women.

00:19:48.067 --> 00:19:49.067
Through her
leadership at the NWRO,

00:19:49.067 --> 00:19:53.800
she pursued a practical
agenda that called for

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.000
decent wages, access to
education and job training,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.800
medical care for
women children,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.200
and children's daycare.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.300
They want decent wages,
access to education and job

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:08.967
training, medical care
for women and children,

00:20:08.967 --> 00:20:10.200
and children's daycare.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.867
And the NR--excuse me, the
NWRO also called for an end

00:20:11.867 --> 00:20:17.300
to abusive and degrading
practices of welfare case

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.667
workers who
would, for example,

00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:24.667
show up at a welfare
recipient's home at

00:20:24.667 --> 00:20:27.600
midnight, looking for
evidence of other means of

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.800
support.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.867
And most often, quote,
"other means of support,

00:20:31.867 --> 00:20:33.600
 meant that an
adult male was present.

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.467
It was built into the
structure of welfare policy

00:20:37.467 --> 00:20:41.200
of this era that
suggestion--you see in

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.500
Moynihan's ideology--that
the norm should be

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.300
patriarchal-headed
family structure.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.567
That if there
was a man around,

00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:56.900
it became much harder for a
person on welfare to be able

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.900
to claim that welfare.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.767
Tillman made her
dissatisfaction known in

00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:05.900
public rallies
across the country.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.900
The title of one of her
more frequent talks was,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.967
was "Welfare is a
Woman's Issue."

00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:15.167
It's a piece that ran
in--that would eventually

00:21:15.167 --> 00:21:16.600
run in Gloria Steinem's
breakout publication Ms.¸

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600
published in 1972.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:20.100
I want to read an
excerpt from that essay,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:26.367
a version of which she gave
at many different rallies

00:21:26.367 --> 00:21:28.200
across the country.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.500
"Welfare is a
Woman's Issue,

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.700
 by Johnnie Tillman.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:33.700
"I'm a woman.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.300
I'm a black woman.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.100
I'm a poor woman.

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.800
I'm a fat woman.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.700
I'm a middle-aged woman.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:43.267
And I'm on welfare.

00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:45.800
In this country, if you're
any one of those things,

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.767
you count less
as a human being.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:51.367
If you're all those things,
you don't count at all,

00:21:51.367 --> 00:21:54.100
except as a statistic.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.100
I am forty-five years old.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.400
I have raised six children.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.700
There are millions of
statistics like me,

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.267
some on welfare, some not.

00:22:03.267 --> 00:22:06.167
And some really poor, who
don't even know they're

00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:08.467
entitled to welfare.

00:22:08.467 --> 00:22:10.500
Not all of them in
black--are black,

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.500
not all--not at all.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.100
In fact, the majority,
about two-thirds of all poor

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.500
families in the
country, are white.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.900
"Welfare's like a
traffic accident.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.967
It can happen to anybody,
but especially it happens to

00:22:22.967 --> 00:22:24.467
women.

00:22:24.467 --> 00:22:27.000
And that's why
welfare is a women's issue.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.167
For a lot of middle-class
women in this country,

00:22:29.167 --> 00:22:32.400
women's liberation is
a matter of concern.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.500
For women on welfare,
it's a matter of survival.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:37.667
Survival.

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:39.200
That's why we had
to go on welfare,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.700
and that's why we
can't get off welfare now,

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.067
not us women.

00:22:43.067 --> 00:22:45.467
Not until we do something
about liberating poor women,

00:22:45.467 --> 00:22:48.900
women in this country,
because up until now,

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.400
we've been raised to expect
to work all our lives for

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.367
nothing, because we
are the worst educated,

00:22:54.367 --> 00:22:57.000
the least skilled, and the
lowest paid people there

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.600
are; because we have to be
almost totally responsible

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.900
for our children; because we
are regarded by everybody as

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.067
dependents.

00:23:06.067 --> 00:23:07.767
That's why we
are on welfare,

00:23:07.767 --> 00:23:10.000
and that's why
we stay on it.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.300
"Welfare is the most
prejudiced institution in

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.967
this country, even
more than marriage,

00:23:14.967 --> 00:23:17.167
when it--which it
tries to imitate.

00:23:17.167 --> 00:23:19.767
Let me explain
that a little.

00:23:19.767 --> 00:23:21.500
Ninety-nine percent of
welfare families are headed

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.700
by women.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.167
There is no man around.

00:23:24.167 --> 00:23:26.367
In half the states
there can't be a man around

00:23:26.367 --> 00:23:29.567
because AFDC (Aid to
Families With Dependent

00:23:29.567 --> 00:23:32.600
Children) says if there is
an "able-bodied" man around,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.100
then you can't
be on welfare.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:35.300
If the kids are
going to eat,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.300
and the man can't get a
job, then he's got to go.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.867
Welfare is like a
super-sexist marriage.

00:23:42.867 --> 00:23:45.800
You trade in a
man for the man.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.000
But you can't divorce
him if he treats you bad.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.400
He can divorce
you, of course,

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.300
cut you off
anytime he wants.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.100
But in that case,
he keeps the kids,

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.600
not you.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.767
The man runs everything.

00:23:56.767 --> 00:23:59.000
In ordinary marriage, sex
is supposed to be for your

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.167
husband.

00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:03.367
On AFDC, you're not supposed
to have any sex at all.

00:24:03.367 --> 00:24:05.200
You give up control
of your own body.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:06.667
It's a condition of aid.

00:24:06.667 --> 00:24:09.400
You may even have to agree
to get your tubes tied so

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.967
you can never have more
children just to avoid being

00:24:11.967 --> 00:24:13.767
cut off welfare.

00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:17.100
The man, the welfare
system, controls your money.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.900
He tells you what to
buy, what not to buy,

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.500
where to buy it, and
how much things cost.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.600
If things,
rent, for instance,

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.367
really cost more
than he says they do,

00:24:25.367 --> 00:24:26.867
it's just too bad for you.

00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:28.700
He's always right.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.900
That's why Governor Ronald
Reagan can get away with

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.867
slandering
welfare recipients,

00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:35.100
calling them,
quote, "lazy parasites,

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.800
 "pigs at the
trough," and such.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.667
We've been trained to
believe that the only reason

00:24:39.667 --> 00:24:41.667
people are on welfare is
because there's nothing

00:24:41.667 --> 00:24:42.767
wrong with their character.

00:24:42.767 --> 00:24:46.067
We've been trained to
believe that the only reason

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:49.000
people are on welfare is
because there's something

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.500
wrong with their character.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.500
If people have motivation,
if people only want to work,

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.300
they can, and they will be
able to support themselves

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.700
and their kids in decency.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.600
"The truth is a job doesn't
necessarily mean an adequate

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.867
income.

00:25:02.867 --> 00:25:05.500
There are some ten million
jobs that now pay less than

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.400
the minimum wage,
and if you're a woman,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.967
you've got the best
chance of getting one.

00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:12.500
Why would a
forty-five-year-old woman

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.900
work all day in a
laundry ironing shirts at

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.900
ninety-some cents an hour?

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.700
Because she knows that
there's some place lower she

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.767
could be.

00:25:20.767 --> 00:25:22.767
She could be on welfare.

00:25:22.767 --> 00:25:26.267
Society needs women on
welfare as examples to let

00:25:26.267 --> 00:25:29.300
every woman, factory workers
and housewife workers alike,

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.600
know what will
happen if she lets up.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.000
If she's laid off, if she
tries to go it alone without

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
a man.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.667
Society needs women on
welfare as examples to let

00:25:41.667 --> 00:25:44.400
every woman, factory workers
and housewife workers alike,

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.267
know what will
happen if she lets up,

00:25:47.267 --> 00:25:49.567
if, if she's laid off, if
she tries to go it alone

00:25:49.567 --> 00:25:51.000
without a man.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.467
So these ladies stay on
their feet or on their knees

00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:55.267
all their lives instead
of asking why they're only

00:25:55.267 --> 00:25:57.100
getting
ninety-some cents an hour,

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.400
instead of daring to
fight and complain."

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Tillman carries this
drumbeat with her to public

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.600
rallies but also to
private meetings.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:15.400
When, in 1968, she meets
with Martin Luther King

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.600
about welfare issues,
she grows increasingly

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.367
frustrated with
King's interruptions and,

00:26:21.367 --> 00:26:24.267
in her view, evasions.

00:26:24.267 --> 00:26:26.000
She goes to King
thinking, you know,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.067
"Here's a man who's really
pledging himself to poverty

00:26:28.067 --> 00:26:32.300
reform or economic
reform, addressing poverty,

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:37.200
 and then realizes that
she's running into a stone

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.100
wall in many ways.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.267
And finally
Tillman says to King,

00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:44.000
"You know, Dr. King, if you
don't know anything about

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.667
these questions, you
should say you don't know,

00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:48.667
and then we can go
on with the meeting."

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.100
King was, like everybody
is--and it's a meaningless

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.367
phrase--"a man of his
time," but his own notion of

00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:02.367
patriarchal order was
certainly well in place.

00:27:02.367 --> 00:27:06.600
Now Tillman and other NWRO
activists linked welfare

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.300
rights to civil rights,
explaining that being on

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.400
welfare was a necessity
borne of the economic

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.167
system, not of
women's moral failings.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.167
So as where
Moynihan and the,

00:27:19.167 --> 00:27:21.100
the Moy--the so-called
Moynihan Report is talking

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:22.100
about structures of
degradation and such,

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:30.000
it is being driven by a
moral assessment of women's

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.100
role in the black family.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:37.400
And the NWRO takes out that
moral assessment and looks

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.600
at the structures of
economic exploitation and,

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.600
and lack of
education and such.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.800
Now the NWRO represents one
type of political thrust of

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.967
the nine--late
1960s and early 1970s.

00:27:54.967 --> 00:27:59.467
It's important that we
not lose sight of this

00:27:59.467 --> 00:28:01.600
grassroots
rallies and activism,

00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.567
calling for structural
changes when it comes to

00:28:03.567 --> 00:28:07.200
welfare, but it's also
important to make note of a

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.400
few different milestones
in the world of politics.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.700
This is the detour
that leads us to Shirley

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.700
Chisholm.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:18.700
Now I spoke earlier about
the fact when the Civil

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:23.800
Rights Act became law, that
there's this moment of great

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.500
excitement, but
very quickly,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.200
people understood it didn't
address voting issues,

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.200
and this was the real next,
this was the next frontier.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.767
You'll also remember that
when I talked about the

00:28:35.767 --> 00:28:37.100
Voting Rights
Act becoming law,

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.100
of course there were riots
a few days later in Los

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.800
Angeles, but looking
ahead a few years,

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.800
towards the end
of the sixites,

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.400
I said you would see a
radical change in the

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.667
numbers of voters.

00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:49.867
The Voting Rights Act,
for all of its flaws of

00:28:49.867 --> 00:28:53.267
implementation
and enforcement,

00:28:53.267 --> 00:28:56.300
did bear witness to a
radical shift in the number

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.000
of blacks who were now able
to get access to the ballot

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
box.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.800
And you start
seeing that change,

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.467
or you start seeing a change
based on the number of

00:29:09.467 --> 00:29:10.700
blacks who were voting.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:17.600
1967 was a landmark moment
in terms of voting behaviors

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.900
and it's actually only
tangential--tangentially

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.200
related, related to
the Voting Rights Act,

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.200
actually.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.200
The story
unfolds in Cleveland.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.367
Carl Stokes, a black man, is
elected mayor of the city.

00:29:32.367 --> 00:29:37.567
He'd been a local figure for
some time and member of the

00:29:37.567 --> 00:29:42.267
police force, very
prominent certainly.

00:29:42.267 --> 00:29:44.900
He's not the first
black mayor ever,

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:47.900
but he's the first black
mayor--first black elected

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.767
mayor of a major city.

00:29:51.767 --> 00:29:54.500
Now what's critically
important to think about in

00:29:54.500 --> 00:30:01.800
Stokes's case is that blacks
are actually the minority of

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.467
the population in Cleveland.

00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:04.467
[Student sneezes] Bless you.

00:30:04.467 --> 00:30:05.467
Stokes becomes really the
first successful coalition

00:30:05.467 --> 00:30:06.467
politician at that level
in the country's history.

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:10.300
He runs on a strong law and
order campaign that appealed

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:16.300
to a real segment
of the population,

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:29.500
conservative and
liberal, certainly.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.900
You know, leans on his past
record as a police officer.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.767
He appeals to the black
community simply because

00:30:36.767 --> 00:30:39.000
here's a black man who's
going to stand up and,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.167
and the assumption is
he's going to speak for us,

00:30:41.167 --> 00:30:42.167
on our behalf.

00:30:42.167 --> 00:30:49.167
But he really pulls in
liberal whites as well,

00:30:49.167 --> 00:30:51.800
and through a
complicated sort of dance,

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.600
forms a coalition,
white and black voters,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.200
becomes the mayor.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.400
His campaign is
watched very closely,

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.167
and it becomes a model
for other black mayoralty

00:31:03.167 --> 00:31:04.300
campaigns
across the country.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:06.800
You start seeing
black mayors popping out.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.300
Gary, Indiana,
just around the bend,

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.100
in Los Angeles,
California, soon enough.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.067
You start seeing the
beginnings of the era of the

00:31:15.067 --> 00:31:18.867
black mayor, in
our urban landscape.

00:31:18.867 --> 00:31:23.700
And as the
voting rights--the,

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.900
the voting numbers start
to skyrocket for African

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.600
Americans, you start seeing
blacks elected to offices

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.167
in, in regions of the
country they had not ever

00:31:33.167 --> 00:31:35.700
been elected,
largely in the Southeast.

00:31:39.767 --> 00:31:42.100
Two years after Carl Stokes
is elected the mayor of

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:44.400
Cleveland, you
actually have,

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:48.600
as a result of an increasing
number of blacks going to

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.367
Congress, a new group formed
called the Congressional

00:31:52.367 --> 00:31:54.967
Black Caucus, still
alive and very well today.

00:31:54.967 --> 00:31:58.067
The
Congressional Black Caucus,

00:31:58.067 --> 00:31:59.500
the CBC, is formed.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.667
And essentially now we
have a critical mass,

00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:03.700
still on the small
side, but a critical mass,

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.667
of black elected officials,
House representatives,

00:32:07.667 --> 00:32:10.367
and then one in the
Senate at that time,

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:19.100
who are going to come
together on agendas that we

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.800
think we share--on which
we share common ground.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.100
Will they always
be race agendas?

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.000
Ah, you know, I guess
that's the presumption,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.067
but there could be common
ground on other issues.

00:32:27.067 --> 00:32:30.000
It will form like a
political action group.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.067
That's essentially
what the caucus is.

00:32:32.067 --> 00:32:34.467
So you have a rising
number of people who are

00:32:34.467 --> 00:32:38.500
in--holding positions of
power in formal elected

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:43.700
offices, and you have the
continuation of grassroots

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:44.767
activism on the ground.

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:51.000
In 1972, and as the
snowball's rolling down the

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.500
mountain, a number of
activists and elected

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:55.500
officials get
together, saying,

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:59.967
you know, "We've got a real
moment of opportunity here.

00:32:59.967 --> 00:33:01.367
We're calling for change."

00:33:01.367 --> 00:33:03.000
There are groups
like the NWRO,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.400
not just--that's not
an all-black group;

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.400
I should have
made that clear,

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.767
it's a multiracial group.

00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:09.067
But you have this
group on the ground,

00:33:09.067 --> 00:33:12.000
other groups like
that on the ground,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.600
small political
action groups in,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.367
in cities
across the country.

00:33:15.367 --> 00:33:17.600
You have black
militants, certainly.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.300
You have still the
black leaders of churches.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.000
That's been there
for a long time.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.600
But now you have these
black mayors and these black

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.100
elected officials and,
and House representatives.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.800
Here's a moment where we
need to take advantage of,

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.700
of our collective experience
as African Americans,

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:37.000
come together and try
to forge a new voice,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.500
a new black political voice.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.667
So they call
for a convention.

00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:43.800
The National Black Political
Convention is held in 1972

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.800
in Gary, Indiana.

00:33:48.567 --> 00:33:50.700
It's a meeting of
black radicals,

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.500
nationalists, and
mainstream politicians,

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.800
and it has the convention
theme of "Unity Without

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:56.800
Uniformity."

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.400
And this is now where I
spend a couple of minutes

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:06.067
reading excerpts from the,
from the platform and from

00:34:06.067 --> 00:34:09.667
Amiri Baraka, a
radical black poet,

00:34:09.667 --> 00:34:12.067
from his poem called
"It's Nation Time,

00:34:12.067 --> 00:34:15.867
 that is rather an
aggressive assertion of

00:34:15.867 --> 00:34:19.500
black militancy and
black nationalism.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.167
And I'll read
these two excerpts,

00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:23.300
trust me on this,
where you have,

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.300
you know, this, this--and,
and Baraka's one of the

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.000
organizers of
this, of this meeting.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.267
He had this very ardent
black militant voice,

00:34:32.267 --> 00:34:34.900
you know, with a poem
laced with shotguns,

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.000
and racial
epithets, and, and,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.367
and challenges to religious
orthodoxies that "it's

00:34:42.367 --> 00:34:43.867
nation time,
it's nation time,

00:34:43.867 --> 00:34:46.800
 is really, you know, what
this--he's calling for in

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.200
the poem.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.900
And you have the
host of the convention,

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.300
like Gary Hatcher,
mayor of--it's not Gary

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:57.100
Hatcher--the Mayor
Hatcher of Gary,

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:02.500
Indiana, Richard
Hatcher, saying,

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.267
"Look, we've got to
find a way to bridge the

00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:06.400
differences," because
he's not going to stand on a

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:11.500
platform of--and I'm
paraphrasing from Baraka's

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.267
phone--poem,
"Niggers get your guns."

00:35:14.267 --> 00:35:16.700
He's not going to
stand on that platform.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.500
We don't want to lose this
opportunity--this organizing

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:25.900
opportunity, and emphasizes,
"We need to have unity and

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.900
understand we
cannot be uniform,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.267
 harking back to the
organizing theme of the

00:35:30.267 --> 00:35:32.267
conference.

00:35:33.567 --> 00:35:36.500
Now the National Black
Political Convention,

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.000
what does it leave us with?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.900
It leaves with
no clear message.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.700
Think back to the
National Negro Congress,

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:48.100
some forty--thirty-five,
thirty-six years earlier,

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.500
same kind of situation where
the coalition of different

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:53.100
kinds of black
voices come together,

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.300
with an unclear result.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.400
But now these people
are elected into office.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:01.067
The National Black Political
Convention exposes the

00:36:01.067 --> 00:36:02.667
diversity of political
opinions within black

00:36:02.667 --> 00:36:03.667
America.

00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:05.667
It does that.

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.067
And a group grows out of it,
the National Black Political

00:36:09.067 --> 00:36:11.067
Assembly.

00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:14.600
And some thought that the
National Black Political

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.367
Assembly--essentially
like the Congressional Black

00:36:16.367 --> 00:36:19.000
Caucus, but now operating
at all levels of political

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.900
organization in society,
grassroots up to the House

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.467
of Representatives--some
thought that this was an

00:36:25.467 --> 00:36:27.300
incredible, going
to be an incredible,

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:31.400
incredible vehicle to
create real change.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.367
And one of the people who
thought it was going to

00:36:34.367 --> 00:36:35.767
create change was
Shirley Chisholm,

00:36:35.767 --> 00:36:38.000
representative
from Brooklyn,

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.367
and the first woman to
represent New York state in

00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:41.367
the U.S.

00:36:41.367 --> 00:36:43.067
Congress.

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:45.900
Chisholm has just declared
her candidacy for the

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:49.567
presidency of the United
States and looked to the

00:36:49.567 --> 00:36:51.300
activists involved in
the Gary convention,

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.800
the National Black
Political Convention,

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.000
looked to the activists at
the convention for their

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.467
support.

00:36:58.467 --> 00:37:00.967
Chisholm's growing out of
the tradition now of someone

00:37:00.967 --> 00:37:02.700
like Carl Stokes.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.767
She's a real
coalition politician.

00:37:04.767 --> 00:37:06.900
She was--this was rad--this
was controversial at the

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.000
time, she was a very public
member of the National

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.767
Organization for Women, a
group that black feminists

00:37:12.767 --> 00:37:14.967
thought was just
for white women,

00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:16.867
something I'll get to a
little bit later on as I

00:37:16.867 --> 00:37:19.067
close out the lecture.

00:37:19.067 --> 00:37:21.167
So Shirley Chisholm has a
whole bunch of support,

00:37:21.167 --> 00:37:23.300
it seems, from people
like Gloria Steinem,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.200
who published Johnnie
Tillman's essay about

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:28.500
welfare.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.867
But then something funny
happens--not funny ha-ha,

00:37:31.867 --> 00:37:36.667
funny unfortunate--is that
as Chisholm goes around the

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:38.367
floor of the
Gary convention,

00:37:38.367 --> 00:37:40.800
as she starts seeking
support from her white

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.567
feminist friends, the cold,
hard reality of politics

00:37:45.567 --> 00:37:47.767
invaded.

00:37:47.767 --> 00:37:49.867
Black elected officials
distanced themselves

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:55.867
immediately from Chisholm,
because they believed that

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.500
her president--her
presidential campaign was an

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.200
absolute--an
absolute long shot,

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.000
and they wanted to align
themselves with more likely

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.567
Democratic contenders
for the national party's

00:38:10.567 --> 00:38:11.567
nomination.

00:38:11.567 --> 00:38:14.467
A crushing blow comes from
Chisholm when she overhears,

00:38:14.467 --> 00:38:17.400
at another black
political conference,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.400
these two officials.

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.400
She's--I guess she's
just within earshot.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.400
One of them
says to the other,

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.867
two black men,
"There she is.

00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:28.067
That little black matriarch
who goes around messing

00:38:28.067 --> 00:38:30.067
things up."

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.300
So you have rising black
political organizations in

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.500
the high form of
politics, a connection,

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.300
it seems, to the grassroots
activism that you see in

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.900
groups like the NWRO.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:47.300
Shirley Chisholm
tapping into this moment,

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.600
like this will be the moment
we can really forge change

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.200
in this country.

00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:54.500
And like someone--I mean
Chisholm wasn't running on a

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:56.200
women's platform, per
se; she's running on,

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.900
running on a liberal
politics platform,

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:03.300
but she was seen as
unelectable by black elected

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:09.267
officials, and also by the
women in groups like NOW.

00:39:09.267 --> 00:39:12.300
They cast their support
to the more mainstream,

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:18.367
quote, "mainstream"
Democratic contenders.

00:39:18.367 --> 00:39:21.867
So Shirley Chisholm seems
as a complete affirmation of

00:39:21.867 --> 00:39:24.400
this double jeopardy status
of black women in the United

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.400
States.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:26.400
You know,
because she's black,

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.400
she's going to
be discounted,

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.700
because she's a woman, she's
going to be discounted.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.767
Just depends on who's
doing the discounting.

00:39:30.767 --> 00:39:33.767
And Chisholm wasn't the only
person to feel this way.

00:39:33.767 --> 00:39:36.900
In 1973, a year after the
National Black Political

00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:42.400
Convention, a group is
formed called the National

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.567
Black Feminist
Organization, the NBFO.

00:39:47.667 --> 00:39:50.100
And it sets about to
criticize the stereotypes of

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:55.567
black women, criticize
the country for caring more

00:39:55.567 --> 00:39:58.400
about black men.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:39:59.800
As long as the
brothers are taken care of,

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.067
the sisters will be
taken care of eventually.

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:05.500
The NBFO activists took
issue with the media for

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.200
imposing standards of
beauty that are purely

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.200
Anglo--Anglophile.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800
The NBFO addressed
practical issues,

00:40:16.867 --> 00:40:19.667
like the NRO--NWRO
did, like child welfare,

00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:21.667
unemployment, etcetera.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.367
And it, the, the National
Black Feminist Organization

00:40:26.367 --> 00:40:30.600
added, in its ideology,
something that had really

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.600
been solely the domain of
white feminist movement to

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.467
that point, namely abortion
rights and equal rights

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:38.967
amendment.

00:40:38.967 --> 00:40:41.900
It is an organization
with an ideologically broad

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.700
umbrella on feminist issues,
broader in its opinion than

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:49.300
the National
Organization for Women.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.500
Now the NBFO,
perhaps predictably,

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.300
was met with a
strong backlash.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:41:00.100
It was accused of hampering
the black movement,

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.700
in air quotes,
"the black movement,

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.967
 is accused of hampering it.

00:41:02.967 --> 00:41:06.300
You know, getting people
confused about what's the

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:08.300
real voice of black America.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.600
Is accused of
being man-hating,

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.100
in part--in large part
because it welcomed lesbians

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.100
into its
organizations, publicly.

00:41:18.967 --> 00:41:21.500
Now all of the
NBFO collapses,

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.000
almost as quickly
as it's formed.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.667
It does not last long.

00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:27.700
It exposed a range of hot
button issues within the

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.767
black community and inspired
other groups to form,

00:41:30.767 --> 00:41:33.367
most famously, the
Combahee River Collective.

00:41:33.367 --> 00:41:36.800
I want to turn quickly
to the Combahee River

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.700
Collective statement,
the collective statement,

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:41.600
and point, to some--point
to some of these hot button

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:42.600
issues.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.767
The statement reads that,
"We are a collective of

00:41:44.767 --> 00:41:47.100
black feminists who have
been meeting together since

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:50.300
1974, involved in the
process of defining and

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.067
clarifying our politics,
while doing political work

00:41:53.067 --> 00:41:55.500
within our own group and
in coalition with other

00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:58.100
progressive
organizations and movements.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.200
We see black feminism as the
logical political movement

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.267
to combat the manifold and
simultaneous oppression that

00:42:04.267 --> 00:42:07.067
all women of color face."

00:42:07.067 --> 00:42:09.767
It goes into the genesis of
contemporary black feminism,

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.300
and then has three
points of what we believe,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.500
the problems in
organizing black feminists,

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.267
and black feminist
issues and projects.

00:42:18.267 --> 00:42:20.300
And I'm excerpting here.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.200
"What We Believe,"
the statement says,

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.567
"Although we are
feminists and lesbians,

00:42:24.567 --> 00:42:27.100
we feel solidarity with
progressive black men and do

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.967
not advocate the
fractionalization that white

00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:32.800
women who are
separatists demand.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.000
We struggle together with
black men against racism,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.600
while we also struggle
with black men about sexism.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:42.400
We are socialists because
we believe that work must be

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.200
organized for the collective
benefit of those who do the

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.067
work and create
the products,

00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:50.167
and not for the
profit of the bosses.

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:52.667
We need to articulate the
real class situation of,

00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:55.467
of persons for whom racial
and sexual oppression are

00:42:55.467 --> 00:42:57.600
significant determinants
in their working,

00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.600
economic lives."

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.367
Calling on the recognition
of problems in organizing

00:43:03.367 --> 00:43:06.100
black feminists, the
Combahee River Collective

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.867
says that, "The major
source of difficulty in our

00:43:07.867 --> 00:43:10.200
political work is that we
are trying to address a

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.800
whole range of oppressions.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.700
We are dispossessed
psychologically and on every

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:17.600
other level, and yet we feel
the necessity to struggle to

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.000
change the condition
of all black women.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.467
If black women were free,
it would mean that everyone

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:26.200
else would have to be free,
since our freedom would

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.700
necessitate the destruction
of all the systems of

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:29.700
oppression."

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:33.567
Again, that notion
of multiple forms of,

00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:36.067
of oppression weighing
down on blackness and,

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:38.067
and
female--women, womanhood.

00:43:39.967 --> 00:43:41.600
And it says in terms of
"Black Feminist Issues and

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:43.500
Projects," is one of the,
"One issue that is of major

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.767
concern to us, and that
we have begun to publicly

00:43:45.767 --> 00:43:48.000
address, is racism in the
white women's movement."

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
I made reference
to this earlier,

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.800
Shirley Chisholm's sort of
confront--what am I looking?

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.100
Wow, just completely drew
a blank on a very basic

00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:06.700
word--controversial, on her
controversial membership in

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:10.000
the National
Organization for Women.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.900
In the
successful rise of the,

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:18.900
the feminist movement, black
women start telling stories

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.367
of trying to affiliate with
what are essentially white

00:44:21.367 --> 00:44:23.367
groups.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.400
And the stories they start
to tell are rather--stories

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.100
of great
frustration, and they,

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.867
they're, they replicate
themselves constantly.

00:44:31.867 --> 00:44:35.100
Black woman going into a
meeting of local N--NOW

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.367
activists and having her
voice being the only voice

00:44:39.367 --> 00:44:42.067
that's silenced, or
having black organization,

00:44:42.067 --> 00:44:44.900
a women's organization,
trying to affiliate with the

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.000
white women's organization,
and the white activists

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.067
trying to take over the
black women's organization.

00:44:49.067 --> 00:44:53.300
Presump--presumption
of who knows best.

00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.700
So the Combahee
River Collective,

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.700
the National Black Feminist
Organization before it as

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:00.000
well, and people
like Shirley Chisholm,

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.300
all recognizing that
there is something flawed,

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:07.567
even in women's
rights organizations,

00:45:07.567 --> 00:45:09.600
and it's, it's
the racial dynamic.

00:45:15.067 --> 00:45:19.200
So you have a rising sense
of black feminist political

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:23.467
awareness and determination
to change the conversation.

00:45:23.467 --> 00:45:25.300
Shirley Chisholm was
certainly frustrated,

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:28.700
but she's
committed to change.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.167
In this era, on
the political front,

00:45:32.167 --> 00:45:34.600
you see a reflection of
that commitment to change,

00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:36.100
where the number of
black women who are elected

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:42.300
officials skyrockets from
fifteen percent of the black

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:46.567
elected officials are
women in the late sixties,

00:45:46.567 --> 00:45:49.400
to nearly sixty percent
by the end of the 1970s.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:55.067
A humongous change in
who's representing this

00:45:55.067 --> 00:46:00.100
constituency, presumptively
but not always representing

00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:01.167
a black constituency.

00:46:01.167 --> 00:46:05.600
Now as I did on Monday,
I was talking about the

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:11.667
incredible cultural
power of the moment,

00:46:11.667 --> 00:46:17.067
and the interesting
narratives of misogyny and

00:46:17.067 --> 00:46:21.200
hyper-masculinity you see
in blaxploitation films.

00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:23.800
This is also an era that
you see the beginning of an

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.667
incredible renaissance in
black women's literature

00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:29.600
especially.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.800
The great author Toni
Morrison appearing on the

00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.667
scene with The
Bluest Eye in 1970.

00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:38.300
Alice Walker, who would
become most famous for

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:41.200
writing Colored--ha-ha,
I just noticed here,

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.500
in my typing
these notes here,

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:49.000
I wrote, I wrote Colored
People--The Color Purple.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.600
Just noticed
that big old typo.

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.300
Anyway, Alice Walker, who
published that book in 1982,

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:56.767
but in the seventies, she
was doing an incredible

00:46:56.767 --> 00:46:59.000
amount of recovery work.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.167
For example, who's, who
here has heard of Zora Neale

00:47:01.167 --> 00:47:02.167
Hurston?

00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:04.767
I mean pretty
much everybody.

00:47:04.767 --> 00:47:07.500
None of your hands would
have gone up prior to the

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.500
nine--early 1970s.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.300
And the hands are being
raised now because of Alice

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.900
Walker's,
essentially, detective work.

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.700
She makes it her
mission, for example,

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.067
to discover Zora
Neale Hurston's grave,

00:47:18.067 --> 00:47:19.067
unmarked.

00:47:19.067 --> 00:47:21.400
Zora Neale Hurston had this
incredible moment in the,

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.067
in the late
thirties and forties,

00:47:23.067 --> 00:47:24.400
but disappears.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:27.500
She dies penniless,
she's working as a maid,

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.300
her writing disappears.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.567
Alice Walker discovers
it and makes an attempt,

00:47:33.567 --> 00:47:36.500
a concerted effort, to bring
her back into the literary

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.200
conversation in
American letters,

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.200
and does it
quite successfully.

00:47:42.467 --> 00:47:44.200
And she's recognizing,
Alice Walker is,

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:47.000
in this recuperative work,
dealing with Zora Neale

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.100
Hurston, that
this new voice,

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:51.100
or in Zora Neale
Hurston's case,

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.400
an older voice, but a new
way of listening to this

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.400
voice.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.800
It's about black women who
wanted to declare political

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.067
engagement on
their own terms,

00:48:02.067 --> 00:48:05.767
not men's, not black men's,
and not white women's.

00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:08.767
And Walker calls for a new
term that would apply to

00:48:08.767 --> 00:48:10.467
black women in general
and that's womanist.

00:48:10.467 --> 00:48:13.967
A womanist politics is a
black feminist politics.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.467
Walker, when asked to
comment on the combination

00:48:20.467 --> 00:48:23.367
of events over the previous
decades that open up the

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:26.500
possibilities
for black women,

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.300
she said, speaking
of her characters,

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:32.567
said "My women in the future
will not burn themselves up.

00:48:32.567 --> 00:48:34.967
Now I am ready to look at
women who have made the room

00:48:34.967 --> 00:48:37.200
larger for
others to move in.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:39.167
I think one reason I never
stay away from the southern

00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:41.500
movement is because I
realize how deeply political

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.800
changes affect the choices
and lifestyles of people.

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:46.400
The movement of the
sixties, Black Power,

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.300
the Muslims, the Panthers,
have changed the options of

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.267
black people generally
and of black women in

00:48:51.267 --> 00:48:55.400
particular, so that my women
characters won't all end the

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:58.800
way they have been, because
black women now offer the

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.067
varied, live models of
how it is possible to live.

00:49:03.067 --> 00:49:06.000
We have a new
place to move."

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.400
And move they did.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.167
We will pick up
discussion on next Monday.

00:49:10.167 --> 00:49:12.167
Thank you.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.590
Prof: Okay let's begin.
 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.948
We've got a terrific guest
today and I'm just going to

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:12.799
briefly introduce him and then
leave forty-eight minutes for

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.760
you to enjoy what he has to say.
 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.594
Will Goetzmann,
a graduate of this college in

00:00:19.594 --> 00:00:20.640
what year?
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.730
Will Goetzmann:  1978.
 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.173
Prof: The class of 1978,
with a professional and grown

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:34.831
up career in art history and in
finance, and that's not an easy

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.550
combination.
 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.140
He does it with grace and with
ease.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.716
He, like Sharon Oster,
is a standout teacher in the

00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:49.620
School of Management MBA
program.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.580
He directs The International
Center for Finance and is--

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.185
the catholicity of his
interests, which we'll see in

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:09.010
his slides and in his analysis
is truly impressive.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.170
Please help me welcome Will
Goetzmann.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.680
Will Goetzmann:
 Well, thanks a lot for the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.272
introduction,
and I'm--I was thrilled with

00:01:21.272 --> 00:01:26.860
the idea of this course so was
really looking forward,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.647
as Doug was describing,
the idea of the course and his

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:34.080
plans for it and what you all
have been doing.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.340
It seems like a fantastic thing.
 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.670
So the question in my mind was,
what could I add today that

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.381
would be of interest to you,
and I thought what I would do

00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:47.111
is focus a little bit on the
historical background to the

00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:48.310
current crisis.
 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.787
I know you've been doing some
reading about the current crisis

00:01:51.787 --> 00:01:55.150
and its relationship to ideas of
capitalism and so forth.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.799
I thought a little bit of
historical foundation would be a

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.546
good thing to lead off with and
give you an idea of how old

00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:09.620
these financial crises are.
 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.780
This is a cuneiform tablet from
the old Babylonian period,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.500
roughly 1600 B.C.
 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.439
It's a loan,
so that it was created with the

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.768
terms of the loan on one side,
and typically,

00:02:27.768 --> 00:02:30.128
although you can't see it from
this side,

00:02:30.128 --> 00:02:32.548
you'll have people that are
witnesses to the loan on the

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:33.120
other side.
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.750
So debt has been around for a
long time.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.714
One interesting feature about
debt is that usually when

00:02:39.714 --> 00:02:43.018
you--if you're a lender,
you like to have some

00:02:43.018 --> 00:02:44.120
collateral.
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.354
The collateral for debts in
this time period often were

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:49.610
human capital.
 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.781
In other words,
if you defaulted on your loan,

00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:56.940
the borrower could seize you
for three years and your family

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.758
and you'd have to work the loan
off.

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:06.668
That sort of debt slavery was
something that began quite early

00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:08.818
in human culture.
 

00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:13.467
You had--when you had--with
that debt slavery there would be

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:18.590
periods when people would get
themselves into a terrible mess,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.014
and let's say crops failed and
lots of farmers wouldn't be able

00:03:22.014 --> 00:03:25.400
to pay off their loans,
you would have lots of the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.050
society in deep debt.
 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.859
And the king,
periodically,

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:36.990
would decree all debts null and
void, so wiping the slate clean.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.370
So here is a fragment by edict
Samsuiluna,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.270
who was the son of Hammurabi,
who, by the way,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.904
lived in the city that Yale has
had a long time expedition to

00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:55.889
excavate called Tal Alon.
 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:01.596
Anyway this is releasing
everybody from bankruptcy in the

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:03.938
form of debt slavery.
 

00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:06.697
But the issue there,
of course, is where you draw

00:04:06.697 --> 00:04:07.330
the line?
 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.127
Which debts do you release,
and if you just want to take

00:04:11.127 --> 00:04:14.443
people out of slavery,
but you want to maintain a

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:17.689
financial system,
how do you differentiate?

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:25.096
The solution to that problem,
at least from the view of

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:29.985
writers in antiquity,
particularly Aristotle,

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:35.730
who wrote about Solon,
comes in the form of another

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.500
major debt crisis.
 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.024
When Solon of Athens became the
autarch, or whatever you want to

00:04:44.024 --> 00:04:48.759
call it, the leader of Athens,
it was about 600 B.C.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:51.190
or so, somewhere in that
timeframe,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.444
and he was brought in
because there was a terrible

00:04:53.444 --> 00:04:55.720
crisis,
much like the crises in the

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.672
Middle East--
it was a period when Athenian

00:04:59.672 --> 00:05:03.490
citizens had been seized for
debts,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.439
and these were debts incurred
typically by farmers,

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:08.240
and then they'd be sold off
outside of Athens,

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.519
they'd just sell them offshore
and export these debt slaves,

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.610
and it created terrible crisis.
 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.079
So, Solon was from a wealthy
family,

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:23.680
he was elected by the--sort of
the rich people in Athens,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.673
they thought that he would
stand up for property rights and

00:05:27.673 --> 00:05:31.735
he wouldn't let the financial
system go to hell just because

00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:35.660
of the pain inflicted on the
poor portion of society.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.100
What he did made nobody happy.
 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.410
He said, "We're going to
preserve property rights,

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.910
we're going to preserve the
right to contract,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.065
but the only thing we're going
to forbid is the right to sell

00:05:49.065 --> 00:05:52.875
yourself into slavery,"
so he drew the line at that

00:05:52.875 --> 00:05:54.470
debt slavery point.
 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.952
Ever afterwards,
people--Athenians would look at

00:05:58.952 --> 00:06:00.644
him,
he sort of was like the George

00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:02.879
Washington of Athens,
and 200 years later,

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:07.230
people would write about this
moment in time when he made the

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.435
differentiation between the
financial system and the system

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:13.028
of human slavery.
 

00:06:13.028 --> 00:06:16.620
It was not to say that slaves
didn't exist,

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.581
but the ability to contract on
your freedom was not allowed

00:06:21.581 --> 00:06:22.949
after Solon.
 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.706
I'm going to skip forward
through a lot of exciting

00:06:26.706 --> 00:06:28.209
financial history.
 

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:30.908
Those of you that like that
kind of stuff might consider

00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:33.002
taking--
I teach a course seminar,

00:06:33.002 --> 00:06:36.339
senior seminar on financial
history in the spring,

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:38.310
so if you are interested in
those topics,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.829
I would love to have you
participate.

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:45.591
I'm going to skip forward to
our debt crisis because I

00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:48.420
worry--
I stay up late nights worrying

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.216
that we're getting ourselves
back into a debt slavery

00:06:52.216 --> 00:06:55.882
situation,
and the recent code that

00:06:55.882 --> 00:07:02.817
we--the bankruptcy code has made
it hard for people to shift off

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:05.620
their debts,
or shake off their debts,

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.079
which is the term that Solon
used.

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:10.307
It was called
seisachtheia or something

00:07:10.307 --> 00:07:13.680
like this, a shaking off,
like an earthquake.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:19.697
But I'm going to skip forward
to 1892 and have you read this

00:07:19.697 --> 00:07:25.817
quote because it lets you have
some sense of where the policy

00:07:25.817 --> 00:07:30.060
for real estate,
mortgage lending in the United

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.089
States might have come from.
 

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:38.279
The occasion for this was a big
festive dinner.

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:41.160
It might have been at
Delmonico's Restaurant,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.629
I'm not sure exactly where,
I don't think it says here,

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.637
but in New York and a bunch of
guys in the real estate business

00:07:47.637 --> 00:07:51.062
in New York were getting
together and they were really

00:07:51.062 --> 00:07:55.004
kicking off an attempt to create
a real estate exchange in New

00:07:55.004 --> 00:07:56.040
York City.
 

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.750
And the exchange--there had
been something like a real

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:03.949
estate exchange where properties
were listed and brokers were

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:07.375
admitted and so forth--
the idea that they were coming

00:08:07.375 --> 00:08:09.932
to was that they needed an
exchange for real estate

00:08:09.932 --> 00:08:10.649
securities.
 

00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:15.350
The real estate securities that
we have now are--

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.937
a lot of them are things
like--you've heard lots about

00:08:18.937 --> 00:08:22.923
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
and subprime loans and

00:08:22.923 --> 00:08:28.339
commercial mortgage backed
securities and things like that,

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:31.815
well these guys were thinking
about setting up exchange to

00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:36.607
trade debt,
maybe some equity too actually,

00:08:36.607 --> 00:08:38.259
in New York.
 

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:41.649
And New York would be the
center of real estate trading.

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:43.658
What were they going to trade?
 

00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:47.955
Well here's a picture,
just a piece of a bond of the

00:08:47.955 --> 00:08:50.649
kind they were going to trade.
 

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:53.139
These things are incredibly
beautiful.

00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:56.855
The New York--the U.S. Bank
Note Company made bonds

00:08:56.855 --> 00:09:01.316
for--made stocks and bonds and
money for all the countries in

00:09:01.316 --> 00:09:04.988
the world,
and they had incredibly

00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:11.269
detailed filigrees and these
beautiful motifs and so forth.

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:16.038
It wasn't to make these things
more attractive to customers.

00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:22.073
All of this detail was really
to prevent counterfeiting,

00:09:22.073 --> 00:09:27.779
because if you could
counterfeit a bond like this you

00:09:27.779 --> 00:09:31.840
could take it in and get
coupons.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.350
So what's this bond?
 

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:37.626
It's a $500 bond,
it's issued to finance

00:09:37.626 --> 00:09:43.769
something called 44 Wall Street
Corporation, and it's The

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:47.168
Manhattan Company building.
 

00:09:47.168 --> 00:09:51.399
Well, 44 Wall Street is still a
building in Manhattan.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:53.711
I don't know if anybody here
might have worked there during

00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:56.155
the summer,
but there was a corporation

00:09:56.155 --> 00:10:00.278
that was set up to build and
operate one single building,

00:10:00.278 --> 00:10:03.389
and there was some equity
capital in the corporation and

00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:05.710
there was some debt in the
corporation.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.009
The debt was issued to the
public in bonds.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:14.765
You and I could go out and we
could buy these bonds and then

00:10:14.765 --> 00:10:17.676
the coupons,
the money that would come in

00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:20.570
from the bonds is money that
would come in based upon the

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.721
rents that were being paid by
people that leased space in this

00:10:23.721 --> 00:10:25.220
44 Wall Street building.
 

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.413
This is a fairly extraordinary
kind of security,

00:10:28.413 --> 00:10:32.083
particularly because we don't
have securities like this

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:32.899
anymore.
 

00:10:32.899 --> 00:10:36.503
I mean there are some bonds
that have been issued against

00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:41.149
buildings,
and I'm thinking now of things

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:44.706
like--
in London you had this vast

00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:49.269
project in the Canary Wharf,
and that was financed with some

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:50.558
really interesting debt.
 

00:10:50.558 --> 00:10:53.197
But one to one,
building to bond,

00:10:53.197 --> 00:10:56.580
really we don't have in the
modern day.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:59.613
This one, by the way,
was issued one month or so,

00:10:59.613 --> 00:11:02.519
right after--not long after the
great crash.

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:07.610
Here's a little bit about this
market.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.552
The market was nothing
much--this is the total

00:11:11.552 --> 00:11:17.158
cumulated amount of outstanding
debt based on the face values.

00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:19.379
The face value of that one was
$500,

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:22.928
you'd multiply that times the
total number of bonds,

00:11:22.928 --> 00:11:27.480
you add all of those bonds that
existed up in this--

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:29.240
these are the numbers you're
getting: $100 million,

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.070
$200 million and so on.
 

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:37.953
You see that even in 1913 there
were some of these bonds being

00:11:37.953 --> 00:11:44.048
issued and then there are two
companies here that we're

00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:47.355
tracking,
New York Title &amp;

00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:51.500
Mortgage Company and Lawyer's
Mortgage Company.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:59.389
These two companies actually
served as guarantors for debt.

00:11:59.389 --> 00:12:02.258
In particular,
actually, what they would do,

00:12:02.258 --> 00:12:05.460
about eight companies got
together--or didn't get

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.928
together, but eight companies
offered a service.

00:12:08.928 --> 00:12:14.081
They would take a residential
mortgage, put a guarantee on it,

00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:18.048
and then sell that mortgage to
somebody else.

00:12:18.048 --> 00:12:24.166
Just like you have bond--one
commercial building offered

00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:28.947
through bonds,
you also had one mortgage for

00:12:28.947 --> 00:12:34.620
one house then guaranteed and
offered for sale.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.139
These firms also began to pool
these mortgages,

00:12:38.139 --> 00:12:41.918
and you'd pool together 100 or
so of these mortgages,

00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:46.378
or a thousand of these
mortgages, put a guarantee on

00:12:46.378 --> 00:12:51.100
them and then sell those pooled
claims out as bonds.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:55.282
So this picture represents not
just those commercial bonds that

00:12:55.282 --> 00:12:57.508
I showed you,
but also residential

00:12:57.508 --> 00:12:58.519
securities.
 

00:12:58.519 --> 00:13:02.447
And you can see what happened
is that they were coming along

00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:05.123
doing fine,
small part of the business,

00:13:05.123 --> 00:13:08.870
and then in the '20s both of
them picked up dramatically.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:13.278
As a matter of fact the First
World War was an important hinge

00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:17.325
point in the history of this
particular kind of financial

00:13:17.325 --> 00:13:18.408
innovation.
 

00:13:18.408 --> 00:13:21.690
The First World War was the
first U.S.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.538
war that was financed by
massive issues of war bonds,

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:29.979
and it became your patriotic
duty to buy war bonds to finance

00:13:29.979 --> 00:13:31.090
the effort.
 

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.856
When the war was over and those
bonds were reclaimed by the

00:13:36.856 --> 00:13:39.275
government,
they were paid off by the

00:13:39.275 --> 00:13:41.980
government,
people had been used to owning

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.850
securities.
 

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.740
A whole operation to sell these
securities had existed,

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:54.500
a sales operation,
so then the brokers said,

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.990
"What else are we going to
sell?"

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:02.730
Real estate bonds became a
really important new product.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:06.379
So you can see this might have
been driven by demand,

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:11.616
actually, for investment
product in a marketing system

00:14:11.616 --> 00:14:17.350
that had grown for savings bonds
earlier during the war.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:21.153
Nevertheless,
you could see this stuff really

00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:24.700
take off and peak around
19--late '20s.

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:31.580
That was cumulative,
this is just new issues.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.434
There you see the drop around
the crash time even more

00:14:36.434 --> 00:14:37.808
dramatically.
 

00:14:37.808 --> 00:14:45.390
This is a picture of
those--plotting those number of

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:53.864
new issues for commercial
bond--for commercial properties,

00:14:53.864 --> 00:14:57.730
against new buildings.
 

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:01.832
Here we only took a look at new
buildings that were seventy

00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:05.298
meters high or so,
so we're looking at really tall

00:15:05.298 --> 00:15:06.288
buildings.
 

00:15:06.288 --> 00:15:12.332
This is a time period when--the
skyscraper was really born in

00:15:12.332 --> 00:15:17.873
the 1890s, and really got going
in the early part of the

00:15:17.873 --> 00:15:20.090
twentieth century.
 

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:25.278
So a question that we've begun
to ask ourselves is,

00:15:25.278 --> 00:15:29.354
maybe the skyscraper was a
response to the emergence of a

00:15:29.354 --> 00:15:32.918
new capital market for fixed
income securities.

00:15:32.918 --> 00:15:38.081
Maybe the financing drove the
desire for big buildings rather

00:15:38.081 --> 00:15:40.490
than the other way around.
 

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.210
I mean New York and other
cities had existed for a long

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.068
time without skyscrapers and
there's a lot of interesting

00:15:48.068 --> 00:15:52.202
theory about how skyscrapers
were kind of a result of changes

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:55.580
in zoning laws in some places
and so forth.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.702
But if you think about it,
London did fine without

00:15:58.702 --> 00:16:00.548
skyscrapers for many years.
 

00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:02.583
Paris, London,
other great capitals of the

00:16:02.583 --> 00:16:04.418
world did fine without
skyscrapers.

00:16:04.418 --> 00:16:07.994
Why would you suddenly have
these sort of immediate

00:16:07.994 --> 00:16:11.640
blossoming of skyscrapers
largely coincident with an

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.360
emergence of a capital market
and ability to sell these bonds?

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:24.538
By the way how would--is there
any way you can think of testing

00:16:24.538 --> 00:16:31.285
that theory about which--
if my theory was finance made

00:16:31.285 --> 00:16:36.340
skyscrapers or finance led to
big buildings,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.350
how would you test that theory
if you had some data?

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:48.759
Prof: Come on guys,
let's take a shot.

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:49.990
Will Goetzmann: Anybody?
 

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:53.386
I'm going to cold call on
somebody, but your chance of

00:16:53.386 --> 00:16:55.759
being cold called--yes,
back there.

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:57.298
Student:  Maybe you
could do a comparison,

00:16:57.298 --> 00:16:59.899
look at other countries where
for some reason--

00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:05.414
perhaps there is a case where
there's another country where

00:17:05.414 --> 00:17:10.358
the capital markets didn't
mature in the same way.

00:17:10.358 --> 00:17:13.873
I mean there's going to be some
endogeneity issues anyway with

00:17:13.873 --> 00:17:15.675
this study,
but that's a start,

00:17:15.675 --> 00:17:19.040
and in comparing if--
how their timing was with

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:21.960
their--the start of skyscrapers.
 

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.897
Will Goetzmann:
 Yeah, so look across

00:17:24.897 --> 00:17:27.756
country,
and cross-sectionally,

00:17:27.756 --> 00:17:33.116
you'd like to find conditions
that maybe didn't have this

00:17:33.116 --> 00:17:35.318
financial explosion.
 

00:17:35.318 --> 00:17:38.518
Student:  Perhaps you
might find some exogenous reason

00:17:38.518 --> 00:17:41.663
why they didn't have the capital
markets that are completely

00:17:41.663 --> 00:17:43.690
independent of the other
factors,

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:45.558
but that's hard to do.
 

00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:46.923
Will Goetzmann:
 Okay, does everybody know

00:17:46.923 --> 00:17:47.549
what endogeneity is?
 

00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:51.210
Everybody who is an Econ.
 

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:54.180
major and you're a senior or a
junior you probably know.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.076
Other than that you probably
think it's some kind of horrible

00:17:58.076 --> 00:17:59.048
skin disease.
 

00:17:59.048 --> 00:18:03.282
Endogeneity means that the
factors that you're studying

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:06.251
could actually be--
it could be some reverse

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:08.814
causality going on,
or there could be some--a

00:18:08.814 --> 00:18:12.410
common unidentified factor that
could be driving both of them,

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.380
and you have to find some way
of sorting this out.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.397
The question is--so the one way
to do this is to find some

00:18:19.397 --> 00:18:22.480
independent phenomena to
observe.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.069
That's what's being proposed.
 

00:18:25.069 --> 00:18:27.380
Any other suggestions?
 

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.336
Here's some college--
Student:  I was just

00:18:32.336 --> 00:18:37.662
going to say that you could
always not only look at the rest

00:18:37.662 --> 00:18:41.424
of the world but look at,
in the United States,

00:18:41.424 --> 00:18:44.479
the development of these types
of bonds and the number of

00:18:44.479 --> 00:18:47.828
skyscrapers like with this,
and I would wager that probably

00:18:47.828 --> 00:18:50.933
the first skyscrapers were not
financed with these types of

00:18:50.933 --> 00:18:52.750
bonds,
which would seem to indicate

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.404
that there was some other factor
at least initially driving

00:18:55.404 --> 00:18:56.640
skyscraper construction.
 

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.782
Will Goetzmann:
 Okay, so if you can find a

00:18:58.782 --> 00:19:01.105
skyscraper that was--
the first skyscraper was--if

00:19:01.105 --> 00:19:03.880
you can show that it wasn't
financed by these bonds than you

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.747
could prove that it's possible
to have skyscrapers without the

00:19:06.747 --> 00:19:09.840
financing,
so that's a way to test the

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.490
basic proposition.
 

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:16.626
It may be--it may not--you can
prove that it's not a necessary

00:19:16.626 --> 00:19:19.660
condition if you find one
example.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:27.059
One more idea--who's an SOM
student?

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:30.950
Got one here--no.
 

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:38.390
You here in the--yes,
gray--charcoal t-shirt.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.185
Student:  Other than
taking a survey looking at

00:19:42.185 --> 00:19:45.974
multiple cities and how--
when skyscrapers started to be

00:19:45.974 --> 00:19:48.346
built,
and when this capital market

00:19:48.346 --> 00:19:50.880
developed,
I don't think I can really add

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.615
anything else other--
Will Goetzmann:

00:19:52.615 --> 00:19:53.078
 That's good.
 

00:19:53.078 --> 00:19:54.608
Take a look cross-sectionally
at the different cities,

00:19:54.608 --> 00:19:57.328
see if they have,
maybe, access to capital

00:19:57.328 --> 00:20:00.049
markets differently across the
cities,

00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:01.589
and see what the timing is.
 

00:20:01.589 --> 00:20:02.690
That's a good idea.
 

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.568
I'll tell you what we have been
doing.

00:20:06.568 --> 00:20:11.416
We figured that one interesting
issue here is--has to do with

00:20:11.416 --> 00:20:13.759
the size of the bond issue.
 

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:17.909
If you have a really--if you
have a tiny building and you

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:21.170
want to go to the public capital
markets,

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:26.803
do you think an investment bank
is going to give you the time of

00:20:26.803 --> 00:20:27.339
day?
 

00:20:27.339 --> 00:20:30.661
Absolutely not;
there are basic issues of

00:20:30.661 --> 00:20:34.068
economies of scale that have to
do with financing.

00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:37.491
So what we did is we said,
"Let's take a look at the

00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:41.159
size of the bond issue,"
we also looked at the height of

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:43.585
the building,
but the size of the bond issue

00:20:43.585 --> 00:20:45.220
is the legitimate thing to look
at,

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:48.369
and presuming that the bigger
the bond issue,

00:20:48.369 --> 00:20:49.779
the bigger the building.
 

00:20:49.779 --> 00:20:53.063
Then we asked,
"Is the interest rate on

00:20:53.063 --> 00:20:56.329
the bond,
that is the rate at which the

00:20:56.329 --> 00:21:00.450
bond was issued,
was that lower or higher for

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.730
bigger buildings?"
 

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.854
What we found pretty strikingly
is that the bigger the building

00:21:06.854 --> 00:21:10.380
the lower the yield,
the lower the cost of capital.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.311
So if you're thinking about--if
you're a developer and you've

00:21:14.311 --> 00:21:16.398
got a plot,
and you could build two small

00:21:16.398 --> 00:21:19.135
buildings or one big building,
or you could finance it all at

00:21:19.135 --> 00:21:21.883
once or one at a time and you
know that you're going to be

00:21:21.883 --> 00:21:23.859
able to have a lower cost of
capital,

00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:24.900
what are you going to do?
 

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.868
You're going to build one
really big building.

00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:30.798
You can see finance has this
potential,

00:21:30.798 --> 00:21:34.170
maybe to possibly even distort
the way that the--

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.746
the way that cities develop,
because of simple issues like

00:21:37.746 --> 00:21:41.670
the cost of capital,
and those guys sitting around

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.690
the--toasting themselves that we
saw in 1892,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.828
the creation of that market for
those securities,

00:21:48.828 --> 00:21:54.027
may have had an influence on
the New York skyline during that

00:21:54.027 --> 00:21:55.240
time period.
 

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.333
Here's just a picture,
by the way, of the tall

00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:02.390
buildings in New York and when
they were all constructed.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:06.679
You see huge boom during this
period, and than a long malaise

00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:10.111
during the middle of the
century, during wartime,

00:22:10.111 --> 00:22:12.900
and then the market picked back
up.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.009
I'll tell you one sort of
shocking thing to me is that the

00:22:18.009 --> 00:22:22.761
residential mortgage backed
security market completely

00:22:22.761 --> 00:22:28.500
disappeared in the '30s and that
commercial one building/one bond

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.788
market completely disappeared at
least by 1940 or so.

00:22:33.788 --> 00:22:36.029
I mean there's still bonds that
may exist,

00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:39.008
but when I say disappeared,
they stopped new issues and you

00:22:39.008 --> 00:22:40.960
couldn't easily trade these
things,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.630
they didn't change hands.
 

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.170
So there are bonds that are
still paying out.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.200
I have a friend whose
mother--whose family has some

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:51.078
securities that were used to
build the Empire State Building,

00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.750
they're still paying them money
and they're proud to own these

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.868
things,
but these are the fossils of

00:22:55.868 --> 00:22:57.130
the financial world.
 

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:00.579
What you had is this
extraordinary period of

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:03.868
innovation in financing of real
estate.

00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:07.698
The shift in the way that
people were able to access

00:23:07.698 --> 00:23:10.452
mortgage money,
and a change in the way the

00:23:10.452 --> 00:23:13.470
developers thought about how
they would build buildings,

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:17.436
and all of it came to a
grinding horrible end as a

00:23:17.436 --> 00:23:20.108
result of The Great Depression.
 

00:23:20.108 --> 00:23:28.182
Did that market cause the crash
or was it--did the fallout from

00:23:28.182 --> 00:23:32.348
the crash destroy that market?
 

00:23:32.348 --> 00:23:34.808
That's the question we're
asking ourselves today,

00:23:34.808 --> 00:23:35.220
right?
 

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.519
We're saying,
"Well, subprime obviously

00:23:38.519 --> 00:23:42.662
caused the big problem that
we're in and so the foolish

00:23:42.662 --> 00:23:45.573
bankers,
idiots that wanted to own their

00:23:45.573 --> 00:23:48.660
own home and were willing to
borrow to the hilt,

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.229
this horrible evil brew of
people that couldn't plan ahead

00:23:53.229 --> 00:23:58.279
and bankers that were willing to
give them enough rope that they

00:23:58.279 --> 00:24:03.009
could hang themselves,"
that's sort of the theme,

00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:04.720
the drumbeat we're hearing.
 

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.298
You know sort of wonder,
maybe the mortgage market is a

00:24:10.298 --> 00:24:14.950
casualty rather than a cause of
this crash.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:23.230
Doug has given you some
readings that--

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:28.328
kind of a hard reading to slog
through,

00:24:28.328 --> 00:24:30.740
but because--although,
again, if you're an Econ major

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.473
you should be able to snap your
way right through this thing

00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:35.559
because it's got a bunch of
regressions,

00:24:35.559 --> 00:24:38.460
and tables, and plots.
 

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.798
Let me just tell you a little
bit about the idea of this

00:24:42.798 --> 00:24:43.430
paper.
 

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.640
I'm doing it with Liang Peng,
who is a colleague of mine,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.227
he's now at Colorado and Jackie
Yen, who is a doctoral student

00:24:52.227 --> 00:24:53.130
at Yale.
 

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.208
Jackie is studying to be a
finance professor but she also

00:24:57.208 --> 00:25:01.722
worked in Wall Street for quite
some time and knows a lot about

00:25:01.722 --> 00:25:05.194
these capital markets,
particularly about mortgage

00:25:05.194 --> 00:25:05.528
data.
 

00:25:05.528 --> 00:25:09.318
The question we're asking is a
simple one,

00:25:09.318 --> 00:25:13.849
like many scholars right now,
we want to try and help the

00:25:13.849 --> 00:25:18.220
world understand what the causes
of this crisis are.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.982
We're in a position that we
don't--I'm not quite sure I know

00:25:21.982 --> 00:25:24.671
what the causes are,
and so the way that we're

00:25:24.671 --> 00:25:27.358
dealing with that is we're
gathering some data and we're

00:25:27.358 --> 00:25:29.900
looking at it and putting
questions to this data.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.720
The data that we got are
housing indexes.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.310
Those come from Bob Shiller and
Chip Case who developed these

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.220
when I was a graduate student
here,

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.619
Bob and Chip Case had just
started building these indexes

00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:45.410
of housing.
 

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:50.825
We really have data going back,
I think they stretch

00:25:50.825 --> 00:25:57.088
back--their data start from
about, well, late '80s or so.

00:25:57.088 --> 00:25:59.970
What they do is they take sales
of housing;

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.420
they take houses that have been
sold twice in a given city,

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.093
and they get thousands of
those, and you can sort of

00:26:08.093 --> 00:26:12.270
figure out what's the best
measure of return to explain all

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.513
of those repeated sales,
so it's actually transactions

00:26:16.513 --> 00:26:18.519
based measures of housing.
 

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:22.074
We've got those for all the
city--the big cities in the

00:26:22.074 --> 00:26:24.904
country, and metropolitan
statistical areas,

00:26:24.904 --> 00:26:26.880
about 320 or 330 of these.
 

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:29.872
Then we have some additional
city level information we can

00:26:29.872 --> 00:26:33.136
compare that to,
then we've got mortgage

00:26:33.136 --> 00:26:35.743
issuance by city,
and finally,

00:26:35.743 --> 00:26:39.637
and this is pretty amazing,
for one year for 2006 we took

00:26:39.637 --> 00:26:43.946
all the mortgages that were
issued in the entire country and

00:26:43.946 --> 00:26:47.380
we have detailed data about
those mortgages.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:52.455
We figured somewhere buried in
this data we're going to be able

00:26:52.455 --> 00:26:56.059
to get some sense of what the
problem was.

00:26:56.059 --> 00:26:57.730
Here's a chart.
 

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:07.080
On this axis is past price
growth from 1999 to 2005--end of

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.210
2005.
 

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.288
What did we do?
 

00:27:10.288 --> 00:27:13.680
We took each one of those
cities, we look at that index

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.815
that Bob Shiller had created,
and we said--we just plotted

00:27:17.815 --> 00:27:22.750
the total growth that that index
had undergone over the period--

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:26.220
over the 2000s, up through 2005.
 

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.740
We wanted to look at the hot
markets.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.700
Which were the really hot
markets?

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.808
Which ones had really grown a
lot?

00:27:33.808 --> 00:27:36.571
You could see some of them had
grown by almost a factor of

00:27:36.571 --> 00:27:39.574
three;
Las Vegas, there are parts of

00:27:39.574 --> 00:27:44.261
California and Nevada,
and Florida that were just off

00:27:44.261 --> 00:27:48.410
the charts, having grown an
amazing amount.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:51.476
By the way there are a lot of
cities where there wasn't much

00:27:51.476 --> 00:27:53.785
growth at all,
the whole cluster here of

00:27:53.785 --> 00:27:56.009
cities that had grown by a
factor of--

00:27:56.009 --> 00:28:00.275
well, they had grown 30% but
that was over a long length of

00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:00.788
time.
 

00:28:00.788 --> 00:28:02.578
They're probably growing at
less than 10% per year.

00:28:02.578 --> 00:28:06.555
Well 10% per year over this
time period was actually a

00:28:06.555 --> 00:28:10.230
pretty good investment when you
think about it.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.650
The stock market was doing
terribly.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.949
We had just gotten off this
horrible bender from the tech

00:28:15.949 --> 00:28:16.480
bubble.
 

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.440
People said,
"Stocks are terrible,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.826
I don't want to invest in them
anymore,"

00:28:20.826 --> 00:28:24.023
bonds were a decent investment,
but they were--people were

00:28:24.023 --> 00:28:26.890
really wondering what are we
going to put my money in.

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:30.125
A lot of people thought
housing, although a modest

00:28:30.125 --> 00:28:34.219
growth in many of these cities,
housing might not be such a bad

00:28:34.219 --> 00:28:34.880
thing.
 

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.804
When you think about it,
if you're sitting in the year

00:28:38.804 --> 00:28:42.578
2000 having just been burned by
the tech bubble,

00:28:42.578 --> 00:28:44.449
and you're saying,
"How am I going to save

00:28:44.449 --> 00:28:45.788
for myself and my family?"
 

00:28:45.788 --> 00:28:49.750
You know, why not put your
money in your house?

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.868
At least you can watch the
asset, you can take care of it,

00:28:52.868 --> 00:28:56.148
you can improve it,
granted you have to pay takes

00:28:56.148 --> 00:29:00.058
on it and you have to fix it up,
and it's not very liquid.

00:29:00.058 --> 00:29:04.457
But you balance these things
off, it might be--it was the new

00:29:04.457 --> 00:29:06.288
asset class of the era.
 

00:29:06.288 --> 00:29:08.827
It was an idea--it was not a
speculative asset,

00:29:08.827 --> 00:29:10.650
it was a savings related asset.
 

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.829
Okay, how about this other axis?
 

00:29:12.829 --> 00:29:19.571
Subprime approvals in 2006;
the log of the dollar amount in

00:29:19.571 --> 00:29:20.828
thousands.
 

00:29:20.828 --> 00:29:25.006
We looked at all of these--we
looked at the rates city by city

00:29:25.006 --> 00:29:26.650
of subprime approvals.
 

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.160
That is, people that had
applied for a subprime mortgage

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.210
and then been approved.
 

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:39.027
A subprime mortgage means you
don't qualify to get a prime

00:29:39.027 --> 00:29:40.150
mortgage.
 

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:43.653
To qualify for a prime mortgage
you have to have steady source

00:29:43.653 --> 00:29:46.452
of income,
you have to have a good credit

00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:49.095
rating,
there has to be a good loan to

00:29:49.095 --> 00:29:51.615
value ratio,
that means you aren't trying to

00:29:51.615 --> 00:29:54.471
borrow too much,
you have to have a house that's

00:29:54.471 --> 00:29:57.981
appraised in such a way that the
loan to value ratio is a

00:29:57.981 --> 00:30:00.740
legitimate measure that a bank
can trust.

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.931
If you're not in that
circumstance then you're in

00:30:03.931 --> 00:30:05.858
sub--the world of subprime.
 

00:30:05.858 --> 00:30:13.277
What we see here is subprime
approvals were more frequent in

00:30:13.277 --> 00:30:18.180
markets where the prices had
gone up.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.500
Why would that be?
 

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.920
Okay I'll ask this as a general
question.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.670
Why would you expect that?
 

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:29.838
Yes.
 

00:30:29.838 --> 00:30:32.714
Student:  When you
have--when the prices are higher

00:30:32.714 --> 00:30:36.276
more people are going to have--
when the prices are higher,

00:30:36.276 --> 00:30:40.558
assuming that incomes in the
cities didn't go up with that,

00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:43.307
you're going to have people
that have lower incomes relative

00:30:43.307 --> 00:30:45.913
to the value of the house that
they're buying because the

00:30:45.913 --> 00:30:48.753
average price is higher and the
amount they're going to borrow

00:30:48.753 --> 00:30:51.454
is also going to need to be
higher relative to the price of

00:30:51.454 --> 00:30:54.067
the house,
so it's going to be a higher

00:30:54.067 --> 00:30:54.500
ratio.
 

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.359
Will Goetzmann:  Okay.
 

00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:58.048
This sounds like endogeneity;
good.

00:30:58.048 --> 00:31:02.000
People--the houses would go up
too fast,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.893
they--a normal loan--they can't
get a normal loan to buy a house

00:31:04.893 --> 00:31:07.740
they might not have been able to
buy ten years ago with a prime

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.009
loan,
so therefore you've got

00:31:10.009 --> 00:31:13.549
necessity of more demand for
subprime loans.

00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:15.269
These are approvals though.
 

00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:19.273
That means the bankers had to
say yes, so bankers had to go

00:31:19.273 --> 00:31:21.759
along with this to get this
graph.

00:31:21.759 --> 00:31:22.670
Yeah.
 

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:25.009
Student:  When prices
are rising there's this almost--

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:27.808
there's a market contagion that
prices can't fall down,

00:31:27.808 --> 00:31:31.128
they can just go upwards,
so people in general just start

00:31:31.128 --> 00:31:34.744
taking more risks and financial
institutions which grant these

00:31:34.744 --> 00:31:37.650
subprime loans also become
overly optimistic.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.803
They all feel that prices have
to go up, and they feel that the

00:31:40.803 --> 00:31:43.500
real value of houses have
increased, and that is--

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.953
Will Goetzmann:
 That sounds like

00:31:44.953 --> 00:31:45.849
irrational exuberance.
 

00:31:45.849 --> 00:31:48.390
Okay.
 

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:54.608
It's easy to say that they're
irrational.

00:31:54.608 --> 00:31:57.279
It's harder to say that they're
rational.

00:31:57.279 --> 00:32:03.096
It would be nice to know
if--first of all Bob Shiller is

00:32:03.096 --> 00:32:07.843
a good friend of mine,
and I love his book,

00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:13.730
and I love his wonderful
intuition about when the cart is

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.150
going off the track.
 

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.785
He tends to be right so it's
hard to deny that irrational

00:32:19.785 --> 00:32:23.420
exuberance is behind a lot of
the big messes we're in.

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:27.673
However, as an economist,
you sort of want to see how

00:32:27.673 --> 00:32:31.598
much you can get with the
rational stories first,

00:32:31.598 --> 00:32:35.690
and then have the remainder be
the exuberance.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.210
We're going to push on that a
little bit--yeah.

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.210
Student:  Yeah,
I interpret this chart as,

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.280
if prices of asset values are
going up and subprime approvals

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:46.353
are going up at the same time
that means the structure has to

00:32:46.353 --> 00:32:49.507
be increasingly leveraged,
that's the only way to fill the

00:32:49.507 --> 00:32:49.759
gap.
 

00:32:49.759 --> 00:32:52.170
You're not saying that subprime
incomes are going up,

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:54.160
but you're saying the approvals
are going up,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.387
so something has to fill that
gap in the purchase price and

00:32:56.387 --> 00:32:58.308
that means they're being more
heavily leveraged.

00:32:58.308 --> 00:33:00.298
Will Goetzmann:
 Yeah, I think that there's

00:33:00.298 --> 00:33:02.288
some evidence consistent with
your observation.

00:33:02.288 --> 00:33:06.481
It's amazing how much you can
get off staring at a graph like

00:33:06.481 --> 00:33:10.605
that because buried behind it
are a whole bunch of decisions

00:33:10.605 --> 00:33:14.240
by individuals applying and by
bankers deciding.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.430
I'm going to show you a picture
just from one city,

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:23.390
this is from Seattle,
and what we've done here is

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:28.432
we've gone from 2006--
what we've done is we've said,

00:33:28.432 --> 00:33:33.740
"Let's extrapolate the
housing price in 2006,

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.182
let's extrapolate it and then
use some econometrics to figure

00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:40.452
out how far down we think it
could go and how far up could

00:33:40.452 --> 00:33:41.200
go."
 

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.413
Those are those two lines
there, and then there's wiggly

00:33:44.413 --> 00:33:47.630
line which shows you exactly
what housing prices did.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:55.170
Actually I'm going to show you
more in just a second.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.200
I want you to understand the
geography of this first.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.108
These are confidence bands and
if you're thinking--

00:34:02.108 --> 00:34:05.026
if you're a banker and you're
going to make a loan the first

00:34:05.026 --> 00:34:08.730
thing you want to know is,
is this loan to value ratio

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:13.440
going to change a lot over the
time period of the loan?

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:16.639
A lot of subprime loans sort of
reset after three years and so

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:17.059
forth.
 

00:34:17.059 --> 00:34:19.449
You'd like to have some
confidence,

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.760
or at least know how far down
the value could go,

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.579
so that you--because you're
worried about the loan value

00:34:26.579 --> 00:34:30.179
being higher--
the loan being higher than the

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:31.260
house value.
 

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.909
That's called underwater.
 

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:36.500
So you're worried about the
value of the asset,

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.873
so this picture is really
putting confidence bounds on the

00:34:38.873 --> 00:34:43.380
value of the asset,
and what this is saying is

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.170
that, in 2006,
if you just extrapolated the

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:50.219
prices from that time you'd get
kind of a flat line,

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.891
and then you didn't--you
wouldn't find any reason to

00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:58.141
expect that over the next three
years prices could drop more

00:34:58.141 --> 00:34:59.510
than 20% or so.
 

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:04.557
Only one time out of twenty
would you get a shock of more

00:35:04.557 --> 00:35:05.550
than 20%.
 

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:10.789
How would you get that?
 

00:35:10.789 --> 00:35:14.652
Here we are;
now here's a whole--here are a

00:35:14.652 --> 00:35:18.018
whole bunch of these--the same
exercise.

00:35:18.018 --> 00:35:19.909
I'll tell you a little bit
about the exercise.

00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:21.518
Here's where the econometrics
comes in.

00:35:21.518 --> 00:35:26.027
We take those indexes that
Shiller gave us for all the

00:35:26.027 --> 00:35:29.208
different cities,
these major cities,

00:35:29.208 --> 00:35:33.876
and than we did something that
any red-blooded econometrician

00:35:33.876 --> 00:35:34.809
would do.
 

00:35:34.809 --> 00:35:38.864
We did an auto-regression which
estimates the relationship

00:35:38.864 --> 00:35:41.710
between past growth and future
growth.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:46.206
What you see from all these
housing indexes is that past

00:35:46.206 --> 00:35:50.753
trends seem to be followed--
there seems to be a huge amount

00:35:50.753 --> 00:35:54.940
of momentum and inertia in these
movements of these markets,

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.110
even when they're going down.
 

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:00.309
Once they start--here's
Minneapolis,

00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:02.786
it was going up like this,
incredible auto correlation in

00:36:02.786 --> 00:36:04.771
past trends,
and then of course once it

00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:07.010
starts going down it just keeps
going down.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:08.880
This is not a random walk.
 

00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:11.400
Housing doesn't follow a random
walk by any stretch of the

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.019
imagination.
 

00:36:12.019 --> 00:36:13.630
It's very, very predictable.
 

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.344
You could predict,
the models tell you that you

00:36:16.344 --> 00:36:18.469
could predict the housing
prices,

00:36:18.469 --> 00:36:22.759
with a huge degree of
confidence for three years out

00:36:22.759 --> 00:36:27.289
just given about twenty--
fifteen or twenty years worth

00:36:27.289 --> 00:36:28.380
of past data.
 

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.731
All of these pictures show you
that for each city there is a

00:36:33.731 --> 00:36:37.360
line which is the past price
increase.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.420
That's the--not Las Vegas--went
up like crazy at one point.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.025
Then there are the two
confidence bands,

00:36:44.025 --> 00:36:47.699
then there's the orange bar
saying what do we expect the

00:36:47.699 --> 00:36:49.170
price trend to be?
 

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.516
But it's not the expectation
that's so important,

00:36:51.516 --> 00:36:54.110
it's this lower bound;
how bad can it get?

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.099
If you're a banker that's the
thing that tells you,

00:36:57.099 --> 00:37:00.090
"Is this loan going to be
a disaster?"

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:04.126
Every single one of these
cities, virtually,

00:37:04.126 --> 00:37:09.288
the actual price just plunged
right through the banker's

00:37:09.288 --> 00:37:11.260
confidence bands.
 

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:16.447
If you've got a model that's an
econometric model that's based

00:37:16.447 --> 00:37:20.733
on past price trends,
and you ran that model in 2006

00:37:20.733 --> 00:37:25.070
you wouldn't have been able to
predict any of this crash.

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:27.862
You would have felt pretty
confident that when you were

00:37:27.862 --> 00:37:32.210
writing those mortgages,
even the subprime mortgage,

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:36.860
that those were good bonds,
that was a good loan.

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:42.030
A subprime loan doesn't mean
that the house is bad;

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:48.530
it just means a borrower is bad.
 

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.230
It's a subprime borrower,
not a subprime house.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.644
So you say, "Look,
what's the worst that could

00:37:53.644 --> 00:37:54.079
happen?
 

00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:59.659
My borrower can't--we get into
some trouble,

00:37:59.659 --> 00:38:01.539
my borrower can't make the
payments on the house,

00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:04.650
then the bank has to repossess
the house,

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.719
but if the house price isn't
going to move much,

00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:09.306
then what the heck,
we'll just turn around and sell

00:38:09.306 --> 00:38:11.739
the house so we've got good
collateral."

00:38:11.739 --> 00:38:16.530
We all know what happened.
 

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:20.471
That model turned out--that
econometric model turned out to

00:38:20.471 --> 00:38:22.170
be a complete disaster.
 

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:28.630
Actually one more point on this.
 

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:35.373
What do you need for an
econometric model aside from an

00:38:35.373 --> 00:38:38.369
econometrics textbook?
 

00:38:38.369 --> 00:38:41.956
SAS, I use R,
I did this from R,

00:38:41.956 --> 00:38:45.429
Stata--some people use that.
 

00:38:45.429 --> 00:38:47.210
What else do you need to run an
econometric model?

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:53.630
This isn't a trick question.
 

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:59.958
You have a blue scarf on,
what do you need to estimate a

00:38:59.958 --> 00:39:02.030
model like this?
 

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.559
Student:  Data.
 

00:39:03.559 --> 00:39:04.610
Will Goetzmann:  Data.
 

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:05.309
Okay.
 

00:39:05.309 --> 00:39:09.934
You need data,
and so the data come from

00:39:09.934 --> 00:39:11.949
Robert Shiller.
 

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:14.938
The fact is,
unless you have those housing

00:39:14.938 --> 00:39:17.489
indexes you can't run this
model.

00:39:17.489 --> 00:39:22.211
The irony of these indexes is
that although they opened a

00:39:22.211 --> 00:39:25.670
world to us of what housing
prices do,

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:29.702
they also made econometricians
believe that they could estimate

00:39:29.702 --> 00:39:32.239
the risk associated with the
housing.

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:35.451
Before we had those indexes we
couldn't do any prediction,

00:39:35.451 --> 00:39:38.382
we couldn't do any of this
sophisticated mathematical

00:39:38.382 --> 00:39:39.340
calculations.
 

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.550
We couldn't walk into the
president of the bank and say,

00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:47.887
"Look, we've done a value
at risk calculation using these

00:39:47.887 --> 00:39:51.869
fantastic indexes that tell us
that the probability of us

00:39:51.869 --> 00:39:55.710
losing more than 20% of our
capital is .005."

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:56.960
You couldn't do it.
 

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:59.907
Suddenly, with this data,
a little bit of information is

00:39:59.907 --> 00:40:03.123
a really dangerous thing when
you put it in front of somebody

00:40:03.123 --> 00:40:05.750
that knows how to crank through
a regression.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:10.059
It's a terrible thing to blame
Bob Shiller,

00:40:10.059 --> 00:40:12.690
the person that forecast this
crash,

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:16.809
to blame him on the other hand,
for providing the matches that

00:40:16.809 --> 00:40:19.510
allowed people to burn down the
house.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.974
It was a failure of models but
you can't run the models without

00:40:22.974 --> 00:40:23.590
the data.
 

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:31.619
I'll just give you a little bit
more flavor for what we do.

00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:34.849
We run a whole bunch of
regressions.

00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:36.804
We're looking for
relationships,

00:40:36.804 --> 00:40:40.465
but mainly what we do is we
divide things up into the world

00:40:40.465 --> 00:40:44.440
of the demand side for loans and
the supply side for loans.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.704
What we want to ask is,
was it the stupid or avaricious

00:40:49.704 --> 00:40:52.630
banker that drove the crash?
 

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:56.713
Or was it the stupid and
avaricious homeowner,

00:40:56.713 --> 00:41:01.250
borrower that drove the crash,
neither, or both.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:08.219
Here we have subprime mortgages
and prime mortgages.

00:41:08.219 --> 00:41:11.523
Roughly when we look at
relationships,

00:41:11.523 --> 00:41:13.489
here's what we find.
 

00:41:13.489 --> 00:41:16.949
We find for both subprime and
prime,

00:41:16.949 --> 00:41:21.110
the numbers of applications and
measured by--

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:25.981
dollars and numbers of
applications were increasing in

00:41:25.981 --> 00:41:27.820
those home prices.
 

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:32.184
So when the home price goes up
you make your forecast of what

00:41:32.184 --> 00:41:36.255
the worst scenario might be,
and if you had a positive

00:41:36.255 --> 00:41:39.742
trend, you would think that
lenders would be more

00:41:39.742 --> 00:41:42.429
comfortable with the bottom
line,

00:41:42.429 --> 00:41:45.360
that they'd be able to get
their money out.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.027
And borrowers,
if they think,

00:41:47.027 --> 00:41:49.545
"Hey look,
I'm buying a house,

00:41:49.545 --> 00:41:52.590
I'm putting every dime I have
into it,

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.155
but the trends look pretty
good, I should be able to get my

00:41:56.155 --> 00:41:59.476
money out at the other
end," then you ought to see

00:41:59.476 --> 00:42:02.860
a positive relationship between
past price increases and

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:07.000
applications,
however you want to slice it.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.199
Somebody mentioned--you
mentioned leverage.

00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:13.800
That's exactly what happened.
 

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:18.373
There was a greater loan to
income requests for--higher

00:42:18.373 --> 00:42:21.929
leverage requests for both of
those two.

00:42:21.929 --> 00:42:27.744
People actually also tended
to--this is loan to income,

00:42:27.744 --> 00:42:32.159
measure of leverage,
not loan to value.

00:42:32.159 --> 00:42:37.480
The loan to value actually
also--the value to loan went up.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.639
Why is that?
 

00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:41.492
People felt comfortable putting
more of their money into houses

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:43.699
and than people bought more
expensive houses,

00:42:43.699 --> 00:42:46.909
but the endogeneity issue--who
mentioned that?

00:42:46.909 --> 00:42:48.489
That was a really important
point.

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:53.230
There were more expensive
houses so that was inevitable.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:56.679
So were people being foolish?
 

00:42:56.679 --> 00:42:59.690
Well that's a hard thing to say.
 

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:03.199
They looked at it as a savings
opportunity.

00:43:03.199 --> 00:43:08.965
You could say this was a crisis
driven by over too much demand

00:43:08.965 --> 00:43:10.289
for savings.
 

00:43:10.289 --> 00:43:13.146
It's just that they didn't save
in--just that the savings

00:43:13.146 --> 00:43:14.369
vehicle was the house.
 

00:43:14.369 --> 00:43:19.018
Were they irrationally
exuberant?

00:43:19.018 --> 00:43:22.985
Well if you look at those
trends maybe I would have been

00:43:22.985 --> 00:43:25.510
fooled by the same trend as
well.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:28.530
How about on the banker's side?
 

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:34.110
Now the banker's job is to say
no, to reject loans.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:35.949
What do we find here?
 

00:43:35.949 --> 00:43:39.760
Now the weirdest thing that we
completely--

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:44.650
that completely shocked us is
that approvals didn't really--

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.750
the rate of approvals for
subprime,

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.309
once we controlled for a lot of
things,

00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:52.690
didn't change as much as we had
expected.

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:58.188
In fact the rate for approvals
for prime actually went down,

00:43:58.188 --> 00:43:59.960
which is strange.
 

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.630
That means bankers were getting
tougher.

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:05.755
Well, they were only getting
tougher because the demands were

00:44:05.755 --> 00:44:06.650
increasing.
 

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.313
You have to look at this as,
the environment was changing

00:44:10.313 --> 00:44:13.780
because the demand for loans was
increasing a lot,

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.346
but so that there were--their
approval rates were actually

00:44:17.346 --> 00:44:18.159
going down.
 

00:44:18.159 --> 00:44:22.637
It really doesn't look like
that--it doesn't look like

00:44:22.637 --> 00:44:27.789
irrational exuberance on the
bankers' part for prime loans.

00:44:27.789 --> 00:44:35.501
Mostly on the prime side,
bankers appeared to be behaving

00:44:35.501 --> 00:44:43.349
really pretty rationally,
less so on the subprime side.

00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:49.300
The loan-to-income ratio,
that was going up;

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:54.980
the value-to-loan ratio was
going down;

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.237
in other words,
people were having to put up

00:44:58.237 --> 00:45:02.327
less of their own cash to own
the home, and people were

00:45:02.327 --> 00:45:05.659
getting higher loans with lower
incomes.

00:45:05.659 --> 00:45:11.119
If anything I think what we're
beginning to convince ourselves,

00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:14.775
using this loan data,
that the subprime market and

00:45:14.775 --> 00:45:19.253
the prime market were two kind
of slightly disjointed markets

00:45:19.253 --> 00:45:23.059
with different decision
processes in operation.

00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:29.141
Both sides had securitization
going on and we haven't attacked

00:45:29.141 --> 00:45:34.625
the question of whether
securitizable loans were driving

00:45:34.625 --> 00:45:37.673
all of this,
but other people have been

00:45:37.673 --> 00:45:38.820
asking that question.
 

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:51.105
We certainly found evidence of
high--of increasing demand in

00:45:51.105 --> 00:45:52.980
prices.
 

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.356
It could be that people are
chasing after--chasing the

00:45:56.356 --> 00:45:56.929
trends.
 

00:45:56.929 --> 00:46:02.632
But it could be also that the
expectation of the liquidation

00:46:02.632 --> 00:46:08.530
value of the house was going up
and made them feel safer about

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.268
the borrowing.
 

00:46:10.268 --> 00:46:14.509
The riskiness of mortgage
applications is increasing in

00:46:14.509 --> 00:46:15.530
past price.
 

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:19.856
Everybody wants to buy more
expensive homes,

00:46:19.856 --> 00:46:24.181
but--that we documented,
and as I mentioned,

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:28.710
there's this disjunction
between the two.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:34.184
That's sort of a--kind of a
flavor for how a professor and

00:46:34.184 --> 00:46:38.409
some graduate students look at
the crisis.

00:46:38.409 --> 00:46:44.021
You've been reading Posner and
you see how somebody tries to

00:46:44.021 --> 00:46:49.934
put the whole thing together;
well, our goal was to kind of

00:46:49.934 --> 00:46:51.570
deconstruct it.
 

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:55.753
Let me see if there's--that's
just a--kind of more documentary

00:46:55.753 --> 00:46:58.429
evidence of what I was talking
about.

00:46:58.429 --> 00:47:05.780
I don't know,
I've looked at history,

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.960
been interested in that,
and looked at current data,

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.440
so with that--I don't know if
we have time for questions or

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.340
not but--
Prof: Yeah I think

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:22.099
there's time for one or two
questions.

00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:24.570
Will Goetzmann:
Back there--Notre Dame.

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:28.170
Student:  On one of your
previous slides,

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:30.974
you mentioned that the supply
side seemed to be almost

00:47:30.974 --> 00:47:35.559
constrained,
and you seem to attribute that

00:47:35.559 --> 00:47:38.322
to, I guess,
potentially greater

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:41.507
responsibility on the part of
the bankers in not approving the

00:47:41.507 --> 00:47:43.440
increased number of
applications,

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:45.860
and I was wondering if you
think that that is the case,

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.463
or if there's evidence that it
could just be that there was a

00:47:49.463 --> 00:47:52.885
constraint on the supply where
banks just were not able to

00:47:52.885 --> 00:47:56.608
issue more loans due to capital
requirements or other financial

00:47:56.608 --> 00:47:57.630
regulation.
 

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:00.121
Will Goetzmann:
 The beautiful part about

00:48:00.121 --> 00:48:03.039
this work is that we're taking
as given that people--

00:48:03.039 --> 00:48:06.773
everybody, the banks and the
borrowers are operating in their

00:48:06.773 --> 00:48:08.079
own best interests.
 

00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:11.755
So that we're looking at this
as sort of a equilibrium outcome

00:48:11.755 --> 00:48:15.431
where they've taken into account
the potential for the capital

00:48:15.431 --> 00:48:18.831
constraints and what have you,
so that negative coefficient

00:48:18.831 --> 00:48:20.594
actually--
you see it here,

00:48:20.594 --> 00:48:24.829
this negative coefficient on
approvals for prime versus

00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:25.768
subprime.
 

00:48:25.768 --> 00:48:29.905
My tone of voice may have led
you to believe that I thought

00:48:29.905 --> 00:48:31.829
that was a foolish thing.
 

00:48:31.829 --> 00:48:35.844
It certainly no evidence that
it's foolish at all,

00:48:35.844 --> 00:48:38.550
but it's an interesting puzzle.
 

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:42.121
I mean, we expected to see
everybody lifting the floodgates

00:48:42.121 --> 00:48:44.340
and make--writing all these
loans.

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:48.583
The notion that the prime
lenders were actually clamping

00:48:48.583 --> 00:48:53.059
down suggests that they were
exercising some judgment about

00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:57.380
quality of loan that resulted in
this negative rate.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:04.400
Prof: One last question.
 

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.829
Will Goetzmann:
 Question here?

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:13.882
Student:  On the same
slide you also implied that the

00:49:13.882 --> 00:49:16.862
supply side,
the bankers,

00:49:16.862 --> 00:49:20.440
were not accepting these
overleveraged mortgage

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.940
applications as much as you
would expect,

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:27.646
but does your research indicate
anything about how overleveraged

00:49:27.646 --> 00:49:31.235
the banks were themselves in how
much capital they were taking

00:49:31.235 --> 00:49:32.530
out of the market?
 

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:37.626
Will Goetzmann:
 The question you're asking

00:49:37.626 --> 00:49:44.389
really implies a point of view
about bank capital requirements.

00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:47.637
Certainly, I'll just use the
data that I showed you,

00:49:47.637 --> 00:49:50.250
so we didn't use that--any
information.

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:52.818
As you know,
this is a big spider web of

00:49:52.818 --> 00:49:56.505
different relationships that
scales all the way up to the

00:49:56.505 --> 00:49:57.833
world,
the government,

00:49:57.833 --> 00:49:59.969
and the role of capital
requirements and regulators.

00:49:59.969 --> 00:50:02.349
We just didn't--we didn't pay
attention to all of that.

00:50:02.349 --> 00:50:06.150
Our job is not to put the thing
together but to see if we can

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:09.949
find certain pieces that help us
understand whether decisions

00:50:09.949 --> 00:50:11.280
were good or bad.
 

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.351
Prof: Thanks,
Will, it was a terrific

00:50:15.351 --> 00:50:16.300
lecture.
 

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:21.000

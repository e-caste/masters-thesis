00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.923
Prof: Okay,
so heretofore in this course we

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:11.721
have treated government as one
of two things:

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:15.110
either,
as in de Soto's frame of

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.070
reference,
a guarantor of property rights;

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.070
or as just background material,
as with Smith,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.189
where the gravamen of Wealth
of Nations and the invisible

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.335
hand story is to encourage
governments to allow free

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:38.530
markets and free trade.
 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.910
There's not much talk about
governments and how they behave.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.733
And today I wanted to correct
that deficiency a little by

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:49.669
talking about government,
and in particular,

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:52.810
about the government of the
United States.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.020
Then turning to the Vioxx,
the Merck-Vioxx case,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.061
and looking at a little bit of
video of Mark Lanier who is the

00:01:07.061 --> 00:01:13.989
main trial lawyer litigant
nationally in the Merck matter.

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:22.810
Now the United States is a very
unusual political system.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.580
It is a so-called presidential
system often copied.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.610
There are probably--I haven't
counted them,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.464
there are probably twenty,
perhaps twenty-five countries

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:41.879
with regimes that look on the
surface like the American one,

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:45.962
and they have in common that
almost every one of them has

00:01:45.962 --> 00:01:46.620
failed.
 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.290
Almost every one of them is
wildly unstable.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.477
The organic growth of the very
complex American Constitutional

00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:05.352
order is essentially unique,
and it begins with what I think

00:02:05.352 --> 00:02:10.776
of as the genius of the founding
fathers expressed particularly

00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:14.188
in Federalist 10 and Federalist
51,

00:02:14.188 --> 00:02:21.250
where the object is to create a
complex system;

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.470
system which makes it hard for
people to put together winning

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.408
coalitions in favor of new
policies;

00:02:31.408 --> 00:02:37.797
which gives enormous advantage
to those defending existing

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:40.377
policies;
which, by the scale and

00:02:40.377 --> 00:02:43.967
complexity of so large a system,
and they thought,

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:48.198
when they began,
of the thirteen colonies as a

00:02:48.198 --> 00:02:52.220
huge republic,
and it was a huge republic.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.699
What came after is the largest
complex republic the world has

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:04.638
known, and probably it is as
large as is feasible with a

00:03:04.638 --> 00:03:08.310
republican form of government.
 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.953
The combination of
federalism--so there are two

00:03:11.953 --> 00:03:17.051
major layers of government,
and the expected diversity of

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:22.780
so large a country make it hard
to form majority coalitions.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.780
Even when you form majority
coalitions,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.830
the system of checks and
balances in the Constitution,

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.744
augmented by the later
emergence of the committee

00:03:34.744 --> 00:03:39.229
system in the House and Senate
at the federal level,

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:46.098
make putting together a winning
majority very difficult.

00:03:46.098 --> 00:03:51.776
Arguably the last presidential
and congressional elections

00:03:51.776 --> 00:03:58.250
created a winning coalition for
some form of healthcare reform.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.925
Though one would have to admit
that listening to the election

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:05.050
wasn't much specificity about
what that might be.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.207
If you watch what's happened
since, the powerful resistance

00:04:11.207 --> 00:04:16.942
to change which is built into
the system has manifested

00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:18.110
itself.
 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.202
Now from the point of view of
capitalism, it is generally

00:04:22.202 --> 00:04:24.470
supposed that this is a plus.
 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:32.680
That the stability of economic
policy and the endurance of laws

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.283
relating to property patents,
commerce, that the relative

00:04:39.283 --> 00:04:44.098
stability of all that owes
something to the fact that no

00:04:44.098 --> 00:04:49.440
mere short-lived majority can
transform the American political

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.980
system and its policies.
 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.149
I think that's broadly true.
 

00:04:54.149 --> 00:05:01.290
The only contingency in which
one would fear for the American

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.954
republic,
and there are people--New

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:07.990
York Times columnist Frank
Rich,

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.555
for example,
New York Times columnist

00:05:11.555 --> 00:05:14.540
David Brooks for another
example,

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.699
who fear that we've come to
that difficult position,

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.115
and that position is this:
if the existing status quo is

00:05:26.115 --> 00:05:29.922
unsustainable,
as one might have thought the

00:05:29.922 --> 00:05:34.973
status quo on the regulation of
banking and mortgages was six

00:05:34.973 --> 00:05:38.576
months or a year ago,
and as some argue the

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:42.593
healthcare system is now,
then all the checks and

00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:47.877
balances which make change
difficult may make it impossible

00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:52.339
to escape from that very
difficult status quo.

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:59.050
Now I am personally an optimist
about the ingenuity and

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:06.879
resilience of the American and
political and economic order,

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.879
but it's important right now to
begin what we're doing today,

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:18.915
understanding that changing
public policy is a heroic

00:06:18.915 --> 00:06:20.810
undertaking.
 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.697
The change of public policy,
which will be in the background

00:06:23.697 --> 00:06:25.459
in the Vioxx case,
is tort reform.

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:32.620
Part--which plays a huge role
in the Vioxx case,

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.225
tort law does,
and is in the background as a

00:06:37.225 --> 00:06:43.865
major factor in the healthcare
reform story because the risk to

00:06:43.865 --> 00:06:49.435
medical practitioners from
surgeons to nurses that is

00:06:49.435 --> 00:06:55.540
presented by tort law is very
great and we'll try to cover

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:00.360
some of that using Vioxx as our
case.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.350
When Vioxx was in the testing
stage I went to my internist and

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:08.341
tried to talk him into getting
me into the trial because I was

00:07:08.341 --> 00:07:12.992
still playing tennis then,
and Vioxx allowed me to--Vioxx

00:07:12.992 --> 00:07:15.439
seemed like a miracle drug.
 

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:20.620
The merit of it,
a Cox-2 inhibitor,

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.788
was that it seemed to reduce
inflammation in your joints and

00:07:25.788 --> 00:07:30.608
therefore reduced pain without
creating inflammation and

00:07:30.608 --> 00:07:33.149
erosion in the intestine.
 

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:40.295
Aspirin and other similar drugs
reduce inflammation in the

00:07:40.295 --> 00:07:46.940
joints, but, as a byproduct,
tear at the intestine.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.079
He was wise enough to say,
"You know,

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:55.540
not every innovation is what it
appears to be,

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.600
and I would urge you not to be
in the trials."

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.906
Being a compliant fellow I took
his advice, and in retrospect,

00:08:02.906 --> 00:08:04.560
I guess I'm glad.
 

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.130
The American system,
and this is not part of the

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:13.673
original design,
has built up an enormous

00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:20.516
practice in lobbying and high
powered lawyering at the federal

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:24.901
level,
and K Street is to lobbying

00:08:24.901 --> 00:08:28.769
what Wall Street is to finance.
 

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:34.267
The existence of trade
associations for every

00:08:34.267 --> 00:08:41.889
imaginable thing is a leading
factor in American politics,

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:46.753
and whomsoever would seek to
control or create some new

00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:51.797
efficiency or new form of
justice in public policy has to

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:55.580
fight her or his way through K
Street.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:03.211
The--I'm about to give you a
series of generalizations which

00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:07.124
are broadly true,
each admits of exceptions,

00:09:07.124 --> 00:09:10.179
but they are about what are the
advantages if we want to play

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:11.250
the K Street game?
 

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.110
One is concentrated interests,
where a particular class of

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.863
individuals or companies have a
lot at stake,

00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:21.909
is a huge advantage.
 

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:23.240
Why is it a huge advantage?
 

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.537
Because it will provoke them to
spend money on lobbying and

00:09:27.537 --> 00:09:30.649
influence, and they will have
the money.

00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:34.426
Whereas, as disbursed
interests, where there are

00:09:34.426 --> 00:09:39.248
perhaps tens of thousands or
even millions of people who have

00:09:39.248 --> 00:09:44.230
small stake in an outcome will
not readily form a well financed

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:49.128
interest association,
and will therefore be less

00:09:49.128 --> 00:09:55.239
strong than a concentrated set
of interests which form a well

00:09:55.239 --> 00:09:57.480
financed coalition.
 

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.629
It goes with the second point
as a truism.

00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:06.220
Well-financed causes trump
poorly financed ones.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:12.019
There are exceptions to that
but not a lot.

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:18.379
Remember that it is a market
society, and money talks.

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:23.724
It is a market society in which
the first amendment gives money

00:10:23.724 --> 00:10:27.054
rights;
that is, if I want to spend

00:10:27.054 --> 00:10:32.922
money putting forth a point of
view and you want to regulate my

00:10:32.922 --> 00:10:37.120
right to do that,
my first recourse of defense

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.860
for the right will be to go to
the courts and say that you're

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.178
infringing my right of self
expression.

00:10:45.178 --> 00:10:49.035
And the courts have often,
not unambiguously,

00:10:49.035 --> 00:10:52.629
but often, ruled in favor of
that view.

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:56.705
Defending the status quo is a
hell of lot easier then changing

00:10:56.705 --> 00:10:57.038
it.
 

00:10:57.038 --> 00:11:02.058
The legislative process is full
of veto points.

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:06.214
The commonest result for
legislation introduced in the

00:11:06.214 --> 00:11:10.995
House of Representatives is that
it is assigned to a committee

00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:13.269
and nothing else happens.
 

00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:16.778
It's assigned to a committee
and nobody brings it to the

00:11:16.778 --> 00:11:17.990
floor for a vote.
 

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.288
The committee may not even hold
hearings.

00:11:20.288 --> 00:11:24.080
If the chair of the committee
is hostile to it,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.600
he probably--hostile to it and
he thinks it might have support,

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:34.176
he will refuse to hold hearings
in a way that's not really the

00:11:34.176 --> 00:11:40.022
subject of this course,
the succession of ways in which

00:11:40.022 --> 00:11:44.440
you can kill new legislation is
spectacular.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.496
Another issue,
the one about agency--agency

00:11:49.496 --> 00:11:52.990
capture is a big advantage.
 

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:58.879
By this we mean that if you are
in the airline business,

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:03.269
let us say, and there is a
Civil Aeronautics Bureau,

00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:08.778
which is assigned the task of
regulating your industry,

00:12:08.778 --> 00:12:13.077
if your industry can make an
alliance with that agency

00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:16.224
itself,
can capture the agency,

00:12:16.224 --> 00:12:22.009
that can be worth an enormous
economic sum because it will

00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:28.097
allow you to structure public
policy in a way which suits the

00:12:28.097 --> 00:12:32.259
combined interests of your
industry.

00:12:32.259 --> 00:12:35.578
Something of the same is said
to be at play,

00:12:35.578 --> 00:12:39.515
and almost certainly is at
play, in the relationship

00:12:39.515 --> 00:12:43.529
between the pharmaceutical
interest and the FDA.

00:12:43.529 --> 00:12:50.908
I've just said that and that at
the same time.

00:12:50.908 --> 00:12:57.340
The CAB, Civil Aeronautics
Bureau, ruled the airline

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:03.769
industry from its inception
until the late 1970s.

00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:06.250
In the late 1970s it was
repealed.

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:15.700
The regime it created assigned
routes to particular companies,

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.927
so you would apply to the
government for the right to fly

00:13:17.927 --> 00:13:21.720
from LaGuardia in Chicago to--
LaGuardia, New York to Midway

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:25.241
in Chicago,
or from Midway in Chicago to

00:13:25.241 --> 00:13:25.668
LAX.
 

00:13:25.668 --> 00:13:31.607
The agency would assign routes
to make sure that there was not

00:13:31.607 --> 00:13:34.139
undue price competition.
 

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:39.759
It would protect oligarchical
pricing, and that is to say

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:42.570
highly profitable pricing.
 

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.936
It would work the Porter
Forces, if you will,

00:13:45.936 --> 00:13:49.379
to the advantage of the
incumbent airlines.

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:55.327
New entrants could be frozen
out, price competition was

00:13:55.327 --> 00:13:58.238
minimal,
most of the competition had to

00:13:58.238 --> 00:14:02.313
do with amenities,
most famously with airline

00:14:02.313 --> 00:14:07.750
attendants averaging twenty-five
years of age,

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.379
and all women and none married.
 

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:20.538
The air travel business was
restricted and wildly

00:14:20.538 --> 00:14:23.210
inefficient.
 

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:29.582
What killed this arrangement
was the observation made by some

00:14:29.582 --> 00:14:35.530
law and economics people that
the airlines which were not

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.105
subject to it,
and the only airlines that

00:14:39.105 --> 00:14:42.333
weren't subject to this
regulation were ones which flew

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:46.630
entirely in one state,
and the most famous case was

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:52.115
the flight between the San
Francisco/Oakland area and the

00:14:52.115 --> 00:14:56.316
LA/San Diego area,
where fares were low,

00:14:56.316 --> 00:15:01.577
they were less than half
comparable fares on interstate

00:15:01.577 --> 00:15:02.649
flights.
 

00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:09.558
A similar story in Texas from
Love Field,

00:15:09.558 --> 00:15:13.340
Dallas in a hub pattern around
the state of Texas,

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.490
fares were lower,
safety was just as good,

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.138
service wasn't quite as good,
but there was genuine price

00:15:21.138 --> 00:15:22.298
competition.
 

00:15:22.298 --> 00:15:27.379
This group came to the fore and
created a national coalition to

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:29.509
deregulate the airlines.
 

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:35.769
The effect was well let's take
somebody at random.

00:15:35.769 --> 00:15:42.408
Who's had--how many of you look
forward to air travel?

00:15:42.408 --> 00:15:50.153
Somebody want to give us a
thirty second essay on why it's

00:15:50.153 --> 00:15:57.490
hard to--why it's not a lot of
fun to travel by air?

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.649
I'll save us time.
 

00:15:59.649 --> 00:16:04.201
It's because flights are by and
large full and the

00:16:04.201 --> 00:16:08.566
Transportation Safety
Administration provides an

00:16:08.566 --> 00:16:16.517
initial indignity on each trip,
and because service is totally

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:17.899
minimal.
 

00:16:17.899 --> 00:16:21.490
You have to buy your own graham
crackers for lunch.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:34.580
It's not--unless you fly first
class or business class,

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.418
which Yale does not allow
except for the very highest

00:16:37.418 --> 00:16:40.038
ranking officers at the
university right now,

00:16:40.038 --> 00:16:45.548
and then only on very long
flights.

00:16:45.548 --> 00:16:50.604
Air travel isn't fun at all,
but what it is is efficient and

00:16:50.604 --> 00:16:55.315
it is in real terms vastly
cheaper than it was under the

00:16:55.315 --> 00:16:57.200
regulatory regime.
 

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.538
And I bring it up just to point
out the advantage of regulation

00:17:01.538 --> 00:17:05.250
under the old CAB regime from
the point of view of the

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.588
airlines and not from the point
of view of the passengers.

00:17:09.588 --> 00:17:15.170
The effect of deregulation was
a long series of bankruptcies in

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.680
which the legacy carriers went
broke.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.301
Those which have survived,
they had gotten so fat under

00:17:22.301 --> 00:17:24.715
the old regime,
that they were wildly

00:17:24.715 --> 00:17:25.788
inefficient.
 

00:17:25.788 --> 00:17:30.506
And most of them died off and
those which survived had to go

00:17:30.506 --> 00:17:35.623
through convulsive change to get
their operating costs low enough

00:17:35.623 --> 00:17:40.180
to compete with the new wave
carriers such as Southwest or

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:41.298
JetBlue.
 

00:17:41.298 --> 00:17:48.681
Well the FDA is,
from a strategic point of view,

00:17:48.681 --> 00:17:53.548
broadly analogous to the CAB.
 

00:17:53.548 --> 00:18:00.289
The FDA is a huge regulatory
jungle which creates powerful

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:06.114
obstacles to new entrants,
and which requires drug

00:18:06.114 --> 00:18:12.151
companies to be extremely well
financed in order to get new

00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:15.170
products through the mill.
 

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:22.426
The impact of that has been to
create a relatively small number

00:18:22.426 --> 00:18:27.108
of gigantic pharmaceutical
companies,

00:18:27.108 --> 00:18:32.343
many of them very well run,
and to induce those

00:18:32.343 --> 00:18:38.599
pharmaceutical companies to aim
at blockbuster drugs.

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:42.618
Merck is one of those companies.
 

00:18:42.618 --> 00:18:48.648
It's--I've shown you this
diagram about combining know-how

00:18:48.648 --> 00:18:54.150
with capital and motivation to
get something done.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:58.923
In a highly regulated
environment you've also got to

00:18:58.923 --> 00:19:04.818
worry about the regulatory and
legal apparatus in a big way,

00:19:04.818 --> 00:19:07.900
and these companies are really
good at that.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.195
They have adapted to the regime
of the Food and Drug

00:19:11.195 --> 00:19:16.114
Administration,
and are terrifically good at

00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:23.624
that, and they are able to put
up pretty high barriers to

00:19:23.624 --> 00:19:28.048
competition from new entrants.
 

00:19:28.048 --> 00:19:34.405
The typical outcome for
somebody--for a small firm which

00:19:34.405 --> 00:19:39.605
has a drug candidate,
is that they get to a certain

00:19:39.605 --> 00:19:44.455
stage in the preliminary phases
of testing and then sell or

00:19:44.455 --> 00:19:49.140
license the drug to one of the
major pharmaceuticals.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:55.529
I'll post this slide.
 

00:19:55.529 --> 00:20:00.045
It's the history of Merck's
interaction with government and

00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:02.769
government's road toward the
FDA.

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:06.230
The interesting thing,
it's in the case about Merck,

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.380
is that it's property was
seized during World War I,

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:12.394
and for the American government
to seize the property of a

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:14.930
corporation is a very rare
event,

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.650
but the problem was of course
World War I,

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.450
the Germans were the bad guys.
 

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.381
They ended up having to buy
their property back on loans

00:20:23.381 --> 00:20:24.740
from Wall Street.
 

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.980
The reason they got the loans
is that Merck was a great

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.160
company, a great company with
centuries of history.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:37.173
The two legislative acts which
are perhaps important to the

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:43.500
background of this case are the
Prescription Drug User Fee Act

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:48.788
of 1992 and the FDA
Modernization Act of 1997,

00:20:48.788 --> 00:20:55.130
both of which gave--put the
drug companies in the position

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:59.801
of funding the FDA's
investigation of their

00:20:59.801 --> 00:21:01.358
proposals.
 

00:21:01.358 --> 00:21:04.936
Now in looking for a
blockbuster drug,

00:21:04.936 --> 00:21:10.352
think of the green square as a
space representing all the

00:21:10.352 --> 00:21:14.509
possible diseases that drugs
could fix.

00:21:14.509 --> 00:21:18.784
They range on the vertical
scale from acute at the bottom

00:21:18.784 --> 00:21:22.448
to chronic on the top,
from rare on the bottom to

00:21:22.448 --> 00:21:24.278
common on the right.
 

00:21:24.278 --> 00:21:28.650
I said chronic up here,
or I meant chronic up here.

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:32.306
It is obvious to you where the
money is to be made in the

00:21:32.306 --> 00:21:34.069
pharmaceuticals business?
 

00:21:34.069 --> 00:21:37.538
Yes back left.
 

00:21:37.538 --> 00:21:38.529
Student:  Common and
chronic.

00:21:38.529 --> 00:21:39.588
Prof: Pardon.
 

00:21:39.588 --> 00:21:39.710
Student:  Common and
chronic.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.318
Prof: Common and
chronic, because if acute,

00:21:43.318 --> 00:21:46.806
the customer may not stay alive
long enough to be truly

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:52.717
profitable,
and common is--has its obvious

00:21:52.717 --> 00:21:54.220
benefit.
 

00:21:54.220 --> 00:22:00.823
The idea of a Cox-2 inhibitor,
the business plan behind the

00:22:00.823 --> 00:22:07.311
Cox-2 inhibitor was to advertise
the hell out of it and to

00:22:07.311 --> 00:22:14.028
capture a huge generation of
people forty and older with bad

00:22:14.028 --> 00:22:16.981
knees,
tennis elbow,

00:22:16.981 --> 00:22:21.240
all those stiff necks,
all those things which go on

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.323
for decades,
during the seventeen year

00:22:24.323 --> 00:22:28.950
patent to make billions upon
billions of dollars.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.167
Blockbuster drugs,
in fact, do make billions upon

00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:37.772
billions of dollars,
and there is a market failure

00:22:37.772 --> 00:22:42.497
problem with this model,
which has to do with less

00:22:42.497 --> 00:22:45.578
common and more acute diseases.
 

00:22:45.578 --> 00:22:50.297
Many, many small disease
populations get

00:22:50.297 --> 00:22:56.465
disproportionately small
investment in drug research

00:22:56.465 --> 00:23:02.028
because of the logic of
blockbuster drugs.

00:23:02.028 --> 00:23:10.710
Merck has had two really famous
CEOs in recent time.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:15.491
This is Roy--I've had both
these guys in my classroom to

00:23:15.491 --> 00:23:20.710
teach this case at one time or
another, Roy Vagelos was a--is

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.579
an M.D., and a brilliant M.D.
 

00:23:23.579 --> 00:23:25.038
and an idealist.
 

00:23:25.038 --> 00:23:29.164
He at one point--I don't know
if this--is river blindness drug

00:23:29.164 --> 00:23:30.180
in this case?
 

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.009
Yeah, the river blindness drug
is one where he--

00:23:33.009 --> 00:23:37.500
the government wouldn't pay to
distribute the drug in Africa,

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.411
but he just had Merck pay,
and thinks he got his money

00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:44.880
back in the motivation of his
research staff.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.292
Ray Gilmartin,
who succeeded him,

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:52.046
and comes in for great abuse in
the Mark Lanier video we'll look

00:23:52.046 --> 00:23:55.869
at,
Ray Gilmartin is an MBA,

00:23:55.869 --> 00:24:02.621
worse yet a Harvard MBA,
and was hell for leather

00:24:02.621 --> 00:24:03.980
marketer.
 

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.837
He looked at the Cox-2
inhibitor market as the best

00:24:08.837 --> 00:24:14.569
single market available in the
generation to Merck and put a

00:24:14.569 --> 00:24:19.271
huge sales force out there,
and went full stop,

00:24:19.271 --> 00:24:22.538
and sometimes a little over the
line,

00:24:22.538 --> 00:24:28.548
with the ethics of inducing
doctors to prescribe the drug.

00:24:28.548 --> 00:24:33.308
Sometimes by straightforward
favor giving,

00:24:33.308 --> 00:24:39.400
sometimes by invitation to
so-called research conferences,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:44.509
which were in actual fact
golfing holidays of the kind--

00:24:44.509 --> 00:24:48.279
now what's wrong with a golfing
holiday aimed at M.D.'s,

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:49.569
if we remember Sharon Oster?
 

00:24:49.569 --> 00:24:51.950
Do we remember?
 

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:57.910
Yes.
 

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:05.588
 
 

00:25:05.588 --> 00:25:06.538
Student:  If I remember
correctly,

00:25:06.538 --> 00:25:08.544
she said it was that if the
doctor was willing to go on

00:25:08.544 --> 00:25:10.825
golfing holiday,
that means the opportunity cost

00:25:10.825 --> 00:25:14.852
he's losing is not that high,
so it's probably not a doctor

00:25:14.852 --> 00:25:16.288
that sees a lot.
 

00:25:16.288 --> 00:25:18.859
Prof: Okay,
so the doctors with the lowest

00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:21.108
opportunity costs were going to
Hawaii,

00:25:21.108 --> 00:25:23.315
go to Hawaii,
and they're not the people

00:25:23.315 --> 00:25:24.730
you're trying to reach.
 

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:29.950
That's certainly true of the
heart technology,

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.666
maybe a little less true of
Vioxx, where a very low key

00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:40.171
practice where you just casually
advise people to take this drug

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:42.529
would be very valuable.
 

00:25:42.529 --> 00:25:48.838
The common law tradition,
the English common law is

00:25:48.838 --> 00:25:54.769
derived not from legislation but
from cases,

00:25:54.769 --> 00:26:01.602
and builds up through precedent
where each new case is analyzed

00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:08.104
by its analogy or lack thereof
to earlier cases which raised

00:26:08.104 --> 00:26:10.970
the same legal issues.
 

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:18.048
This tradition goes back a
thousand years,

00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:23.232
or nearly a thousand years,
and came to the United States

00:26:23.232 --> 00:26:28.877
with the immigrants who came to
New England in the seventeenth

00:26:28.877 --> 00:26:34.710
century and is a dominant part
of the American Legal Code,

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:39.284
which is largely separable from
Congress and the Legislative

00:26:39.284 --> 00:26:40.058
process.
 

00:26:40.058 --> 00:26:47.590
And central to it is the idea
that courts should make the

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:53.374
victims of careless,
reckless, or fraudulent

00:26:53.374 --> 00:26:58.097
products whole;
should make them--should bring

00:26:58.097 --> 00:27:02.506
them back to a situation as good
as they would have been in if

00:27:02.506 --> 00:27:05.470
they had not received the bad
product.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:10.490
Beyond that,
often punitive damages,

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.681
where if we say this person was
harmed to the extent of $100,000

00:27:14.681 --> 00:27:18.740
so we'd pay him the $100,000 at
the expense of the company.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.817
We then say,
this is a huge company,

00:27:21.817 --> 00:27:26.653
$100,000 means nothing to this
company so let's say $100

00:27:26.653 --> 00:27:27.710
million.
 

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:31.566
Most of the $100 million is
punitive damage,

00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:36.767
which nonetheless goes to the
victim, but is meant to teach

00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:39.009
the company a lesson.
 

00:27:39.009 --> 00:27:43.653
Well from the point of view of
business, punitive damages are

00:27:43.653 --> 00:27:44.660
very scary.
 

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:49.480
And the American legal
landscape is a particularly

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:54.497
complex one for that reason
because with federalism,

00:27:54.497 --> 00:27:55.480
Ghen v.
 

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.022
Rich, you remember it,
Ghen v.

00:27:59.022 --> 00:28:04.729
Rich is about tort law,
and about setting incentives in

00:28:04.729 --> 00:28:10.140
a way that works well for
society as a whole,

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:14.230
and the problem with Merck
Vioxx is similarly that.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:20.238
I'll give you one more common
law case to get the feel of

00:28:20.238 --> 00:28:20.990
this.
 

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:26.606
At the close of World War II,
the guy who owned this property

00:28:26.606 --> 00:28:32.318
near an airport sued the airport
for the noise of planes going

00:28:32.318 --> 00:28:34.660
through his airspace.
 

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.443
He said I own the airspace;
they can only come through if

00:28:39.443 --> 00:28:43.343
they have my permission or pay
me rent on the use of my

00:28:43.343 --> 00:28:44.210
airspace.
 

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:52.200
The plaintiff had a very strong
common law precedent.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:58.162
The common law theory of
airspace was that you make a

00:28:58.162 --> 00:29:02.406
projection from the--
after people were sure the

00:29:02.406 --> 00:29:06.463
world was round,
it's a spherical projection,

00:29:06.463 --> 00:29:11.848
to the ends of the universe,
you owned everything that is in

00:29:11.848 --> 00:29:14.868
that spherical projection over
your land.

00:29:14.868 --> 00:29:23.583
Now you were--you're a judge,
its 1947, the airline industry

00:29:23.583 --> 00:29:31.410
is just getting strong,
and you're presented with this

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.740
case.
 

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:42.779
Tal, how would you decide it?
 

00:29:42.779 --> 00:29:46.297
Student:  Well,
since the airline industry is

00:29:46.297 --> 00:29:50.365
just getting strong I might want
to incentivize them to keep

00:29:50.365 --> 00:29:53.470
flying and keep
&gt;

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.452
which would obviously be very
difficult if I let every single

00:29:56.452 --> 00:29:58.853
person--
it would obviously be very

00:29:58.853 --> 00:30:02.951
difficult to let the airline
industry form if I let every

00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:07.489
single person who owns property
control the airspace over their

00:30:07.489 --> 00:30:10.930
property because then they would
have to--

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.280
the transaction costs would be
huge to negotiate with each and

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.490
every single person.
 

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.740
Prof: Absolutely.
 

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.430
That nails the question.
 

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.846
A flight--a little flight from
Chicago to Milwaukee or from

00:30:21.846 --> 00:30:24.506
Milwaukee to Madison,
Wisconsin or from Madison,

00:30:24.506 --> 00:30:27.421
Wisconsin to Minneapolis,
would involve thousands of

00:30:27.421 --> 00:30:31.161
transactions and license fees
with the owners of all the land

00:30:31.161 --> 00:30:35.730
you're going to traverse,
and the airline industry would

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.490
be stillborn for that reason.
 

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:44.689
In the background of this case,
just as in the background of

00:30:44.689 --> 00:30:45.950
Ghen v.
 

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:50.628
Rich, is creating
incentives for those who are

00:30:50.628 --> 00:30:55.212
prepared to invest in the
generation of value and

00:30:55.212 --> 00:31:00.180
ultimately of wealth for the
society as a whole.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.094
Mr. Justice Douglas,
in May of 1946,

00:31:04.094 --> 00:31:07.226
wrote the opinion in U.S.
 

00:31:07.226 --> 00:31:07.450
v.
 

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:13.825
Cosby, which decided the
case in favor of the airlines

00:31:13.825 --> 00:31:17.740
and against the landowners.
 

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:24.298
Now the plaintiff bar--let's
not do the summaries.

00:31:24.298 --> 00:31:26.450
Let's see if I can remember how
we're going to do this.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:34.942
DVD stage, play,
this is a set of interviews we

00:31:34.942 --> 00:31:37.500
sent a--
this is Mark Lanier:

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.170
"I think Merck ultimately
has to settle,

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:42.761
maybe not all of the cases,
but Merck certainly needs to

00:31:42.761 --> 00:31:44.328
settle the good cases.
 

00:31:44.328 --> 00:31:50.862
What Merck needs to do is wait
until the statute of limitations

00:31:50.862 --> 00:31:51.598
runs.
 

00:31:51.598 --> 00:31:54.910
What that means is that there's
a time period after you're

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:57.640
damaged where you have to file
your lawsuit,

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.212
and if you don't file within
that time period your rights are

00:32:01.212 --> 00:32:01.630
gone.
 

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:05.372
Merck needs to go ahead and
wait and let that time period

00:32:05.372 --> 00:32:08.227
run,
so that there is a fixed

00:32:08.227 --> 00:32:11.467
denominator,
how many cases are out there,

00:32:11.467 --> 00:32:13.992
and then the numerator,
how many of those is Merck

00:32:13.992 --> 00:32:15.750
going to settle,
can be determined.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.278
I'm not sure that Merck needs
to settle every case out there.

00:32:18.278 --> 00:32:21.578
These cases are expensive to
fight and they're hard to fight,

00:32:21.578 --> 00:32:27.778
and so Merck can satisfactorily
settle the difficult cases of

00:32:27.778 --> 00:32:31.795
serious injury,
where really I think all of us

00:32:31.795 --> 00:32:34.670
ultimately agree Merck owes the
money,

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:38.632
and then Merck can take those
cases of lesser liability and

00:32:38.632 --> 00:32:42.380
ultimately tell the lawyers,
'You want us, come get us.'

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.328
That's where this has got to
end up I think."

00:32:45.328 --> 00:32:51.086
I think there are probably
about 25,000 to 30,000 cases

00:32:51.086 --> 00:32:55.990
that ultimately will be filed
against Merck.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:59.480
Out of those 25,000 to 30,000
how many of them are good cases?

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.191
I would guess probably--you've
got different degradations of

00:33:04.191 --> 00:33:04.750
good.
 

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.259
It's like students,
there's A good and there's B

00:33:07.259 --> 00:33:10.356
good, then there's C not so
good, and then there's D and F,

00:33:10.356 --> 00:33:11.798
really not good at all.
 

00:33:11.798 --> 00:33:15.548
How many A/B cases in that
grouping?

00:33:15.548 --> 00:33:18.779
Over half of them I think are
probably A/B cases.

00:33:18.779 --> 00:33:21.190
How many of those are C's?
 

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.358
Maybe a third;
how many of them are D and F?

00:33:24.358 --> 00:33:26.661
Maybe about 25%,
I don't know,

00:33:26.661 --> 00:33:31.185
my percentages may not add up,
but it's something in those

00:33:31.185 --> 00:33:33.250
ranges at least."
 

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:42.298
My guess is $12 to $15 billion
dollars for liability for Merck.

00:33:42.298 --> 00:33:46.880
I think if Ken Frazier,
the general counsel for Merck,

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.425
came to me and said,
'Lanier here's $12.5 billion

00:33:49.425 --> 00:33:51.502
dollars,
make my headache go away,' I

00:33:51.502 --> 00:33:53.955
could come pretty close to
resolving all of his

00:33:53.955 --> 00:33:54.808
issues."
 

00:33:54.808 --> 00:34:00.878
"There's a great deal of
difficulty in trying to set up a

00:34:00.878 --> 00:34:04.759
jurisdiction for hearing these
cases.

00:34:04.759 --> 00:34:09.407
The way the law is set up,
philosophically the plaintiff

00:34:09.407 --> 00:34:12.980
who has a burden of proof,
the plaintiff has to prove

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.280
their case,
and a tie goes to the defendant

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.010
if you will.
 

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.898
The plaintiff with a burden of
proof is supposed to get a pick

00:34:19.898 --> 00:34:20.599
of forum.
 

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:24.443
By that it means if you've got
to prove your case you should be

00:34:24.443 --> 00:34:27.730
allowed to choose in which court
you want to do it.

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:29.835
Realistically,
in America, all of our courts

00:34:29.835 --> 00:34:32.300
are supposed to be fair,
but practically,

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:36.079
we recognize that some are more
plaintiff friendly,

00:34:36.079 --> 00:34:38.409
and some are more defense
friendly,

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:42.277
and so the plaintiffs naturally
try to find those courts that

00:34:42.277 --> 00:34:43.889
are plaintiff friendly.
 

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:48.018
The defendants want defense
friendly courts.

00:34:48.018 --> 00:34:50.590
We tried the first case in
Texas.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.512
Texas has a reputation for
being plaintiff friendly,

00:34:53.512 --> 00:34:55.978
realistically I think at this
point in time,

00:34:55.978 --> 00:34:57.239
it's probably not.
 

00:34:57.239 --> 00:35:01.019
Our judge was appointed to the
bench by George Bush when he was

00:35:01.019 --> 00:35:02.239
Governor of Texas.
 

00:35:02.239 --> 00:35:04.090
George Bush,
President Bush,

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.969
is certainly no friend to trial
lawyers.

00:35:06.969 --> 00:35:11.976
We have an appellate court
system in Texas that is entirely

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:13.099
Republican.
 

00:35:13.099 --> 00:35:16.911
There will not be a Democratic
judge that will ever see the

00:35:16.911 --> 00:35:19.342
Vioxx case we have,
we tried in Texas,

00:35:19.342 --> 00:35:22.630
or the ones pending right now
to my knowledge.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.110
In New Jersey you've got a
different scenario.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:29.931
You've got a court system
that's very friendly,

00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:33.420
ideologically at least,
with big pharma.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:36.891
Pharma has a home in New
Jersey, has great tort reform in

00:35:36.891 --> 00:35:39.596
New Jersey,
and until we got the punitive

00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:43.117
damage finding against Merck,
had never been held responsible

00:35:43.117 --> 00:35:45.983
for punitive damages in New
Jersey under the current state

00:35:45.983 --> 00:35:46.989
of the law."
 

00:35:46.989 --> 00:35:52.123
Prof: If you Google
"judicial hell-hole"

00:35:52.123 --> 00:35:57.074
you will find a map showing the
most plaintiff friendly

00:35:57.074 --> 00:36:00.099
jurisdictions in the country.
 

00:36:00.099 --> 00:36:06.509
The huge ideological battle and
political battle which is in

00:36:06.509 --> 00:36:12.592
progress, about federalizing and
capping tort law awards,

00:36:12.592 --> 00:36:14.440
is out there.
 

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.795
Just go "tort reform"
or "judicial

00:36:16.795 --> 00:36:18.956
hell-holes"
and you'll get the flavor of

00:36:18.956 --> 00:36:19.300
it.
 

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.289
Mark Lanier:
"So New Jersey is

00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:26.070
somewhere that I think Merck
would like--

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:46.650
 
 

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.724
" "The Harvard
Business School slide that I've

00:36:49.724 --> 00:36:51.960
put was not the first slide I
showed,

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.579
but it certainly was in my
opening statement.

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:59.179
I wanted the jury to understand
that when--

00:36:59.179 --> 00:37:01.400
before Ray Gilmartin came on
board,

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:06.833
Merck--which was 1994,
Merck was run basically by a

00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:10.530
CEO named Dr. Vagelos and Dr.
 

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:15.130
Vagelos is a world-renowned
doctor, phenomenal doctor.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:19.356
When Ray Gilmartin came on
board Merck didn't hire a

00:37:19.356 --> 00:37:22.920
world-renowned doctor to run the
company.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.635
Merck didn't hire a
world-renowned chemist,

00:37:26.635 --> 00:37:29.909
or even a nationally known
chemist.

00:37:29.909 --> 00:37:31.610
Heck, I'd have taken a local
chemist.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:36.389
They didn't hire a pharmacist,
someone who had experience with

00:37:36.389 --> 00:37:40.541
pills and medicines on even a
local level, much less a

00:37:40.541 --> 00:37:42.030
national level.
 

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:46.210
What Merck did is they took a
different direction.

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:49.110
They changed directions from
the Vagelos days,

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.596
Dr. Vagelos days,
and they hired an MBA which I

00:37:52.596 --> 00:37:57.333
have a lot of respect for MBA's,
but I think we need to put into

00:37:57.333 --> 00:38:00.949
context what it was speaking to
within the Merck culture.

00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:04.489
It was saying no longer is
science running our company,

00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:07.978
we're now going to run this
company along economic terms as

00:38:07.978 --> 00:38:10.742
a business,
and Ray Gilmartin came in,

00:38:10.742 --> 00:38:15.353
as a Harvard trained MBA,
who had really no science

00:38:15.353 --> 00:38:17.760
background whatsoever.
 

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:24.762
It was an--I put the Harvard
Business School slide up to put

00:38:24.762 --> 00:38:31.882
a visual image to go with the
intellectual concept that Merck

00:38:31.882 --> 00:38:39.360
was choosing to be a business
first company not a patient--

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.242
When we tried the Ernst case,
I was stunned at the opening

00:38:43.242 --> 00:38:44.469
that Merck gave.
 

00:38:44.469 --> 00:38:48.775
Understand Bob Ernst died from
what's called sudden cardiac

00:38:48.775 --> 00:38:49.369
death.
 

00:38:49.369 --> 00:38:53.815
Sudden cardiac death means you
are dead by the time you're in

00:38:53.815 --> 00:38:58.114
the hospital and the cause is
not something they can easily

00:38:58.114 --> 00:39:00.355
trace,
but it's clearly a heart

00:39:00.355 --> 00:39:00.889
problem.
 

00:39:00.889 --> 00:39:05.380
The sudden cardiac death was
attributed to an arrhythmia,

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.929
which is a ventricular
fibrillation for him,

00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:11.202
his heart was quivering,
and the question ultimately

00:39:11.202 --> 00:39:13.434
becomes,
what caused that heart

00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:14.960
quivering arrhythmia?
 

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.018
Most typically,
according to the Merck

00:39:17.018 --> 00:39:20.056
Manual,
it's caused by a heart attack,

00:39:20.056 --> 00:39:23.380
but it can be caused by an
electrocution,

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.980
it can be caused by inhaling a
lot of salt water in a drowning,

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.800
and it can be caused by being
exposed to hypothermia.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:38.369
Clearly none of those is what
had happened to Bob Ernst.

00:39:38.369 --> 00:39:40.320
Bob Ernst had had a heart
attack.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:45.121
I was stunned in opening when
the Merck lawyer stood up and

00:39:45.121 --> 00:39:48.159
told the jury,
disingenuously I believe,

00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:52.137
that if the jury looked at the
coroner's report they would see

00:39:52.137 --> 00:39:56.309
that they coroner said Bob Ernst
had not had a heart attack,

00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:59.744
Bob Ernst had died from
arrhythmia secondary to

00:39:59.744 --> 00:40:01.090
arthrosclerosis.
 

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.659
Well, those are both caused by
a heart attack.

00:40:05.659 --> 00:40:13.050
Someone may have died from a
loss of blood okay,

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.759
but if someone was shot,
and it was the gunshot that

00:40:15.759 --> 00:40:18.150
caused the bleeding and the loss
of blood,

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.179
it's disingenuous to stand up
and tell a jury,

00:40:20.179 --> 00:40:22.079
well they didn't die from the
bullet,

00:40:22.079 --> 00:40:24.268
they died from loss of
blood."

00:40:24.268 --> 00:40:27.324
I was shocked by that because I
thought it was a

00:40:27.324 --> 00:40:29.822
misrepresentation,
and I think Merck did it

00:40:29.822 --> 00:40:32.608
thinking they could get away
with it because no one had ever

00:40:32.608 --> 00:40:35.489
been able to find the coroner
and ask her what she meant,

00:40:35.489 --> 00:40:39.170
and so I don't have any
testimony to the contrary,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.510
we just have a report.
 

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.280
I went back to my office and I
said, 'I want the coroner.'

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:44.840
And they said 'We can't find
the coroner.'

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.360
I said 'We can find anybody
except Bin Laden,

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.960
find the coroner.'
 

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.779
We hired a couple of PI's,
we found the coroner doing

00:40:53.779 --> 00:40:57.820
pathology work in the United
Arab Emirates Abu Dhabi.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.400
I shot her an email asking her
if she would mind if I spoke

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.079
with her.
 

00:41:02.079 --> 00:41:05.730
She emailed back and said she'd
be glad to speak with me.

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:09.094
I called her on the phone and I
said, here is what was said

00:41:09.094 --> 00:41:12.460
about this case in opening,
here is what your autopsy said,

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:13.679
tell me about it.
 

00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:17.148
She said 'Well he died,
under an autopsy I have to put

00:41:17.148 --> 00:41:20.121
the physical cause,
physical cause it was a sudden

00:41:20.121 --> 00:41:21.909
cardiac death with an
arrhythmia,

00:41:21.909 --> 00:41:23.699
secondary to arthrosclerosis.'
 

00:41:23.699 --> 00:41:25.059
I said 'Well how does that kill
you'?

00:41:25.059 --> 00:41:26.699
She said 'Easy,
you have a heart attack.'

00:41:26.699 --> 00:41:28.420
I said 'Really?'
 

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:30.528
She said 'Of course,
that's the only thing that

00:41:30.528 --> 00:41:31.079
causes it.
 

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:33.789
Arthrosclerosis causes a heart
attack;

00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:35.889
the heart attack causes an
arrhythmia.'

00:41:35.889 --> 00:41:38.001
She said 'Unless he was
electrocuted,"

00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:39.659
she said 'Was he electrocuted?'
 

00:41:39.659 --> 00:41:40.869
I said 'No.'
 

00:41:40.869 --> 00:41:42.280
She said 'Okay.'
 

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.250
I said 'Would you come over and
explain that to the jury?'

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:46.880
She said 'I would be glad too,'
so she came over.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.393
Well Merck threw a fit because
Merck says we never would have

00:41:50.393 --> 00:41:53.789
told the jury what we did if
we'd known Lanier was going to

00:41:53.789 --> 00:41:56.599
be allowed to tell the truth
about it."

00:41:56.599 --> 00:42:03.469
Prof: That film is
almost an hour long.

00:42:03.469 --> 00:42:07.639
We had it made for the MBA's a
couple of years ago.

00:42:07.639 --> 00:42:20.489
Mary Pat, you're not the
coroner but if I asked you,

00:42:20.489 --> 00:42:24.532
is there--is another set of
relationships that involve

00:42:24.532 --> 00:42:28.117
Merck,
that were behind the scenes in

00:42:28.117 --> 00:42:31.650
all this,
and what you know about it,

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:32.840
help me out.
 

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.150
Student:  Sure.
 

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:37.907
Well in addition to all the
plaintiffs who brought cases

00:42:37.907 --> 00:42:40.811
against Merck,
Merck also had taken out

00:42:40.811 --> 00:42:45.313
insurance policies for product
liability and liability exposure

00:42:45.313 --> 00:42:48.148
insurance,
and they took them from a bunch

00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:51.431
of companies like Munich
Reinsurance and at the same time

00:42:51.431 --> 00:42:53.719
that all these cases were going
on,

00:42:53.719 --> 00:42:55.969
Merck was trying to collect on
those policies.

00:42:55.969 --> 00:42:59.951
Basically they wanted money
because they had to pull Vioxx

00:42:59.951 --> 00:43:03.583
and all the exposure,
they were losing a lot of money

00:43:03.583 --> 00:43:05.260
in profits that way.
 

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.409
These insurance companies were
saying,

00:43:08.409 --> 00:43:11.789
"Well you are exercising a
breach of warranty,

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:15.605
because when you took out these
policies you basically told us

00:43:15.605 --> 00:43:18.420
that this sort of a thing
wouldn't happen,

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.635
but we're saying that you knew
something like this would

00:43:20.635 --> 00:43:21.239
happen."
 

00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:26.902
Prof: Did the company
your close relative represented

00:43:26.902 --> 00:43:29.110
end up paying or not?
 

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.789
Student:  They paid some
of the damages but not all.

00:43:32.789 --> 00:43:36.210
Prof: Some sort of a
negotiated settlement?

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:41.619
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:43:41.619 --> 00:43:44.300
Prof: Let me finish this.
 

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:50.911
The ultimate outcome was a
negotiated settlement amounting

00:43:50.911 --> 00:43:57.987
not to $12.5 billion dollars as
Mark Lanier thought or claimed

00:43:57.987 --> 00:44:01.699
to think, but $4.85 billion.
 

00:44:01.699 --> 00:44:06.384
What happens is the Court
system creates a class action

00:44:06.384 --> 00:44:11.329
suit and then settles the class
action suit in a way which

00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:15.579
creates a scoring system for the
plaintiffs,

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:17.659
the tens of thousands of
plaintiffs.

00:44:17.659 --> 00:44:24.400
The score you get depends on
how long you used the drug,

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:29.869
and how severely you suffered,
and how plausible the causal

00:44:29.869 --> 00:44:35.340
connection between what happened
to you and the drug is.

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:40.235
For example,
if you took Vioxx for a short

00:44:40.235 --> 00:44:45.969
period of time but were a 280
pound diabetic,

00:44:45.969 --> 00:44:51.320
with a major smoking problem,
and a quart a day bourbon

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:54.150
problem,
the odds were that you weren't

00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:57.170
going to get a lot of money out
of the settlement,

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:58.900
so it's a mechanical system.
 

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:04.759
And I personally believe that
when used within reasonable

00:45:04.759 --> 00:45:10.617
limits common law is a way of
protecting relatively small

00:45:10.617 --> 00:45:14.280
people against large companies.
 

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.447
The adjudication of that
boundary, which is now in

00:45:18.447 --> 00:45:21.000
progress, is very important.
 

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.163
The killer for large companies
is the transaction costs of

00:45:27.163 --> 00:45:33.110
settling so many cases can
themselves be prohibitive.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:38.400
Okay, exam on Wednesday and
back to work on Monday.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.000

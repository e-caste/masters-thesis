♪ [Say it Loud, I'm Black and
I'm Proud - James brown] ♪

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:48.800
I think maybe I just wanted
to be a DJ in another life.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.467
I just like playing clips.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:54.300
The--So this is an excerpt
from James Brown's "Say It

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000
Loud, I'm Black
and I'm Proud."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.900
It's released in 1968.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.667
You know, we aren't quite
there chronologically yet.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:02.567
I'll be coming, coming up
to it in the course of the

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:04.100
lecture though.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.100
And it becomes
an immediate hit,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.000
a popular hit, and
a political hit.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.900
It's played at rallies to
rev up the crowd and call

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.567
and response, certainly.

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:17.400
Brown actually distances
himself from the song after

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.200
a handful of years, saying,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.467
"Look, we needed it
at that moment.

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:23.300
We needed it to develop
pride in the black community

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.900
to understand who
we were as a people,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.800
but, you know, things
are more complicated now."

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.300
This is something he's
saying in the 1970s,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.500
as his politics
start going off in,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.867
in a variety of
different directions.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:39.500
But we are at this moment,
for the purpose of today's

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.167
lecture, essentially '66
through the end of the

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:45.067
six--through the
end of the decade.

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:49.567
We're at this moment of
profound fascination with

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.500
blackness in a different,
in a different kind of way.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.800
It's being articulated in
different ways than it was

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.500
at the moment of SCLC's
being established or SNCC's

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.500
establishment.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.367
We're at a moment of
incred--sort of in the wake

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:05.600
of incredible successes with
the Civil Rights Act and the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.000
Voting Rights Act, a moment
of incredible ambiguity:

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.367
what are we going
to be doing next?;

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:12.600
what's the next
step in the journey?;

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.300
and a moment of
profound rupture.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.600
I already talked a little
bit about this last week

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.300
with--calling attention to a
tone shift and a strategic

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.967
shift as far as black
freedom movements are

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:26.600
concerned in the
late--mid to late 1960s,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.900
and we'll deal with it a little

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.300
more explicitly today.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.967
One more clip, this one a

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:44.200
video clip, as a way to get
another, well as a way to

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.800
get more traction on
what's happening in this

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.700
particular moment.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.900
It's a very short one.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.900
Eldridge Cleaver, who
had gained fame from his

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.100
writings in prison was the
chief spokesman for the party.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.400
We feel that the police must
be brought under control by

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.367
any means necessary,
including through force of

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:11.667
arms, and we have never
bit our tongue about that.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:13.067
We say it now,
loud and clear,

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.500
we will always say it and
we're not afraid to say it,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.200
that the racist Gestapo pigs
have to stop brutalizing our

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.200
community, or we're
going to take up guns,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.867
we're going to
drive them out.

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:27.767
I think he made his
point rather clear.

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:31.100
This is a period of
also incredible

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.300
rhetorical hyperbole.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.700
I mean, I'm not saying that
he didn't mean these things

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.100
certainly, but, but the,
the scope of what's actually

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.100
going to happen, the
violence and the rhetoric,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.700
is palpable and we are
certainly past that moment

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.300
of the beloved community,
with Martin Luther King and

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.300
his dream in 1963.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.900
And we'll talk, depending
on how far I get in today's

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.100
lecture, might start talking
about King's final years

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.000
today, or we'll certainly
pick it up on Wednesday.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.400
But you'll see the
unraveling of this beloved

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.400
community, especially when
we start talking about King.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.767
Now you saw a clip there
about Eldridge Cleaver,

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:10.200
Minister--Minister of
Information for the Black

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.200
Panther Party.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.900
Let's back up a few steps,
overlapping where we were

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.700
last Wednesday, make sure
we're all on the same page

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.600
about the Black Panther
Party's establishment in

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.767
this moment of the
Black--the Black Power

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:22.967
moment in general.

00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:24.800
You remember that I
talked about the

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.900
Lowndes County Freedom
Organization in, in Alabama,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.900
the Lowndes County
Freedom Organization,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.300
the first group to embrace
the black panther as a

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.600
symbol.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.567
Stokely Carmichael, a
veteran of Mississippi

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:41.900
Freedom Summers
and freedom schools,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.100
just out of
college essentially,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.400
SNCC activists--activist,
goes down to Lowndes County

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.267
where he discovers these
farmers and helps them

00:04:50.267 --> 00:04:51.867
organize into the LCFO.

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:55.667
Becomes a radicalizing
moment for Carmichael,

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:59.000
one that is on sort of
a steady pace for him,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.600
one radicalizing
moment after another,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.500
that eventually leads to his
exile from the United States

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.900
in just a handful of years.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.300
So we're in 1966.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.400
James Meredith, young man,
a civil rights activist who

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.200
had integrated Ole Miss, the
University of Mississippi,

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.867
the bastion of state
privilege in that particular

00:05:22.867 --> 00:05:23.867
state.

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:25.200
If you wanted to become
a leader in Mississippi,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.300
you went to Ole Miss, and
this was a place that was

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.000
unavailable to
African Americans,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.067
and James Meredith
wanted to change that.

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:33.800
He integrates Ole Miss
a few years earlier,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.567
and in the process,
residents of the area riot

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:40.400
and actually kill federal
marshals who are there to,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.967
you know, ensure the
place gets integrated.

00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:46.100
James Meredith is an
iconoclastic character if

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.300
ever there was one, and
actually comes out very much

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.567
against civil rights
later on in his life,

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:52.467
saying it was
demeaning that we,

00:05:52.467 --> 00:05:56.600
that African Americans
had to still cling to these

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.900
notions of civil rights
heritage and battles.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.800
James Meredith decides that
he wants to call attention

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.800
to the changes in
Mississippi that have been

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.200
very real, certainly, and he
decides he's going to march

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.800
across
Mississippi in June of '66,

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.400
a March Against Fear.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.900
"No one's going to
tell me what to do.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.267
No one's in
control of my life."

00:06:21.267 --> 00:06:23.267
He's marching by himself.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.600
Civil rights leaders,
people on the ground,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.167
friends of the movement, are
el--all telling Meredith,

00:06:33.167 --> 00:06:34.267
"This is crazy.

00:06:34.267 --> 00:06:36.200
You cannot do this.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.700
Okay, you've done a lot
of great things for the

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.300
movement, but the idea of
actually trying to march

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.400
across Mississippi
by yourself without,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.100
without protection is
a suicide mission."

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.867
It turns out
they're almost right.

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:50.900
Meredith starts off on his
march and before you know

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.967
it, he's laid flat by shots,
someone driving by with a

00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:54.967
shotgun.

00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:58.467
He's hospitalized.

00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:00.000
He survives, of
course, he's--but,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.067
but it's not clear at that
moment what's actually going

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:03.100
to happen.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.967
Leaders of the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:09.900
Committee,
SCLC, CORE decide,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.167
"Well we're not going to
let--Now we're not going to

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:13.767
let this march fail."

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:16.000
So they set out to complete
Meredith's march against

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.267
fear, so they're going to
march across the state.

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:23.267
At a stop in
Greenwood, Mississippi,

00:07:23.267 --> 00:07:25.467
Stokely Carmichael,
now the leader of SNCC,

00:07:25.467 --> 00:07:31.700
been thrown in jail for
I think the eighth time,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.800
I believe.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.167
They'd done the jail,
no bail strategies.

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:37.600
The march is still going on.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.467
Stokely Carmichael gets
out of jail and tells an

00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:43.800
assembly out on the lawns,
"The only way"--excuse me.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.900
"The only way we're going
to stop them white men from

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:51.900
whipping us is to take over.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.600
We've been saying
'Freedom' for six years,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.600
and we ain't got nothing.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.600
What we're going to
start saying now is 'Black

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.600
Power.'" And it's
call and response.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.600
You know, "What
do you want?"

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600
"Black Power!"

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600
"What do you want?"

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600
"Black Power!"

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.600
starts going
through the audience.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.167
Now Carmichael wasn't the
first to start calling for

00:08:15.167 --> 00:08:16.800
Black Power,
using that phrase,

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.200
but he popularizes it, and
so it becomes attached him.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.767
People had been ruminating
over that phrase and sort of

00:08:23.767 --> 00:08:27.367
throwing it around for
months at that point,

00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:29.967
but this is one of these
sort of lightning flash

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:33.500
moments, where it captures
the national attention and

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.500
also scares the nation.

00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:41.200
King heartily disapproves.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.200
It's like, this
kind of, you know,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.400
calling for this kind of
militancy is misplaced.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.700
The country is at sea, and
we're going to alienate all

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.967
those people who might be
fellow travelers in this

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:56.400
journey with us, by this
kind of--with this kind of

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:57.400
anger.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.400
I mean sure, we
can be angry,

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.400
but this is not the path.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.367
So you take together the
Lowndes County Freedom

00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:08.600
Organization and
its rising profile,

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.800
Stokely Carmichael
being on the ground there,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.267
Stokely Carmichael and
others taking up the March

00:09:13.267 --> 00:09:16.900
Against Fear after James
Meredith has been shot.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.467
Carmichael
essentially snapping,

00:09:18.467 --> 00:09:20.200
saying, "The hell with this!

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.000
You know, trying to do
things through the system is

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.267
only getting people
shot without retribution.

00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:29.267
We need Black Power.

00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:31.400
We need to stand
up on our own."

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.167
You remember whites had
been now thrown out of SNCC.

00:09:35.167 --> 00:09:37.167
They no longer have a
place in the movement.

00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:43.367
In October of
that same year,

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:46.967
two college students at
Merritt College in Oakland,

00:09:46.967 --> 00:09:50.800
California, Huey
Newton and Bobby Seale,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.767
formed the Black Panther
Party for Self-Defense.

00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:56.467
The Black Panther
Party for Self-Defense.

00:09:56.467 --> 00:09:59.600
They'd been
hearing about the LCFO,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.000
thought it was a
fantastic idea.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.600
They'd been seeing
this radicalizing moment

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.467
happening in
SNCC, and they say,

00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:06.900
you know, "It's time for us
to take our stand on our own

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.900
terms.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.967
We need to embrace
Black Power as well."

00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:16.000
Huey Newton declares himself
the Minister of Defense of

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.100
the Black Panther
Party for Self-Defense,

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.400
and Bobby Seale
is its chairman.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:25.400
And I just realized,
[laughs] I left what I was

00:10:30.167 --> 00:10:34.467
going to read at home.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.900
Anyway, it's a good
thing it's in your reader.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.700
The, the, at the
moment of their founding,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.300
the issue of the Black
Panther Party platform,

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:45.200
it's a couple of pages
long in your reader.

00:10:48.267 --> 00:10:49.600
I can't read the
points I was going to read,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.467
but the fact is
essentially this.

00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:53.600
I want you to look at
that particular document,

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.400
and look at the kind of
things that the platform is

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400
calling for.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.200
It's calling for the
kinds of fundamentals,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.800
for lack of a better phrase,
that I've been calling your

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.000
attention to from other
freedom organizations since

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.867
the Niagara
Movement in 1905.

00:11:09.867 --> 00:11:11.000
Now it's calling
for more than that,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.100
of course, but it's still
calling for fundamentals.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.900
This is the state
of the conversation.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.367
It seems to not have
changed in some ways.

00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:21.300
Now it has changed in the
sense that the Black Panther

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.300
Party is,
through, through the,

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.067
the platform, and then what
you're going to see later in

00:11:27.067 --> 00:11:28.867
the Executive
Mandate Number One,

00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:30.867
talking about in a
few moments here,

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.867
is connecting African
American freedom struggles

00:11:36.867 --> 00:11:38.367
to what's happening
on a global scale.

00:11:38.367 --> 00:11:42.700
It's clearly
Marxist in its ideology,

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.200
in its political--its, its
understanding of political

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.167
economy.

00:11:47.167 --> 00:11:50.600
It's viewing its struggle
in the light of what it

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.367
considers United States
imperialism in places like

00:11:54.367 --> 00:11:55.367
Vietnam.

00:11:55.367 --> 00:11:58.700
It's being motivated by the
kinds of militancy that you

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:03.300
see black soldiers coming
home from yet another war,

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.400
still being denied
their citizenship,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.600
but now the ground has
shifted enough that they can

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.700
articulate themselves
in a different way that,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.667
that is calling for
armed self-defense.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:16.800
It's not about, you know,
trying to get in the front

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.900
door of a bus or the
front door of a restaurant.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.600
It's about something
much larger than that,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600
about being a
global citizen.

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:32.200
Well, as the Panther Party
is organizing itself and

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.400
delineating in
the, in the program,

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.100
in the platform the ways
it shall be organized--no

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.567
you're not going to drink,
you're not going to do

00:12:38.567 --> 00:12:39.800
drugs, you're
going to, you know,

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.900
be respectful in all
different manners of life,

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.667
and whether they succeeded
in that or not is a whole

00:12:43.667 --> 00:12:46.900
other kind of conversation.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:53.300
The Panthers start
looking for a way to grow,

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.800
and they hear about this
guy named Eldridge Cleaver.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:01.767
Eldridge Cleaver,
thrown in jail--I'm sorry.

00:13:01.767 --> 00:13:08.400
My notes seem to be all
over the place today.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:14.400
It's fascinating--thrown in
jail and then writes this

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.900
book Soul on
Ice, and becomes,

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.767
you know, is
incredible--incredibly

00:13:19.767 --> 00:13:22.400
charismatic and
quite brilliant as well.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.100
The Panthers realize
they can actually tap into

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.100
Eldridge Cleaver
and his charisma,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.900
and they use him as the
Minister of Information.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.567
That's how you saw him
speaking to the public in

00:13:33.567 --> 00:13:36.600
his position as the
Minister of Information,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.367
trying to spread the
narrative of what the

00:13:42.367 --> 00:13:44.367
Panthers were all about.

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:50.100
Now the popular notion
of the Panthers is highly

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:54.400
masculine, these young
men representing the,

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.500
you know,
manhood of the race,

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.500
they're very virile.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.600
They've got their
black leather jackets,

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.500
they've got the
berets, their turtlenecks,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.500
very fashionable.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.500
There are some women in
the Panthers as well,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.767
but, you know, where they
fit into the movement at the

00:14:09.767 --> 00:14:11.767
early stage is really
a little bit unclear.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.300
Panthers are armed.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:21.200
They're going to take back
the streets under their own

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.400
terms and take control away
from the "racist pigs" as

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.400
they refer to the cops.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.700
The Panthers would do--the
bases they were in Oak--in

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:36.000
Oakland at their
founding--decided to take

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.800
control of that
community first,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:43.800
and very
contro--controversially,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.267
one of the tactics
they decided to pursue is

00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:48.700
monitoring the police.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.600
Just as you see
people in Los Angeles in,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.767
at the flashpoint of the
L.A.--the Watts riots,

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:58.100
excuse me, people frustrated
by the years of police

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.600
brutality, unmarked,
unchecked police brutality;

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.300
Oakland residents
felt the same way.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:05.500
And so the Panthers
start to patrol the police,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.867
it's the famous
Panther Patrols.

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:13.000
They studied the California
laws to the letter,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.100
and they knew that they
had a right to carry guns,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:23.000
and they knew that they had
a right to watch the police.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.300
And they knew that if the
police arrested somebody,

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.900
they could stand witness, as
long as they kept say twenty

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.600
or thirty feet, I
don't know the distance.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.167
As long as they kept
distance--the proper

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:34.600
distance from the
police, they could observe

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.800
everything that's happening.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.600
Now as you can imagine, if
you're a police officer,

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.200
whether you are a racist
pig of an officer or not,

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.000
you're not going to be too
thrilled about angry men

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.367
with guns following you
around when you arrest

00:15:49.367 --> 00:15:51.767
somebody, whether they
deserve to be arrested or

00:15:51.767 --> 00:15:52.767
not.

00:15:52.767 --> 00:15:53.900
You're not going to be
too happy about that,

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:54.967
because the guns are loaded.

00:15:54.967 --> 00:15:58.000
It creates
incredible friction,

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:02.600
and creates a crisis
at the state capital.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:09.500
The Panthers--the
state legislature,

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.600
very unhappy about
these Panther Patrols,

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:20.600
entertains a bill that makes
it illegal to carry weapons

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.600
in urban districts.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.100
Well, the Panthers
were exclusively urban.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.300
Now it didn't mention race,
didn't mention the Panthers,

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.767
but it clearly was
targeting the Panthers,

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:32.867
trying to kill
these Panther Patrols.

00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:37.600
So the Panthers decide
to go up to Sacramento,

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:41.000
the state capital,
and challenge the bill,

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.400
and while they're
there, something of a circus

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800
happens.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.167
I want to play to you--for
you a clip of that circus.

00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:53.100
The boldness of the Panther
actions attracted young

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.367
blacks, many in their teens.

00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:56.300
Carrying loaded firearms in
public was a well-protected

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.300
legal right in California.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:59.300
But with the emergence
of the Black Panthers,

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.800
state officials introduced
legislation to outlaw

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.267
carrying loaded
firearms within city limits.

00:17:02.267 --> 00:17:04.200
May 1967, in protest
the Panthers traveled to

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.200
Sacramento, the
state capital.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.467
We arrived there, all
these black men and women,

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:08.700
twenty-four males
and six females,

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.667
with guns and Ronald
Reagan, then the governor,

00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:13.100
was on the lawn with two
hundred future leaders of

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.100
America, you know, twelve
and thirteen and fourteen

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.100
year old kids.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.067
And these kids started
leaving this session on the

00:17:18.067 --> 00:17:19.567
lawn and coming to see us.

00:17:19.567 --> 00:17:22.267
And these young white kids
thought we were a gun club.

00:17:22.267 --> 00:17:23.700
Knowing the media
would be there,

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.200
the group of men and women
then entered the capitol

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.200
building.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.200
They're heavily armed,
whether their weapons are

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.900
loaded or not,
nobody seems to know.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.900
Wait a minute.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.900
Am I under arrest?

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.900
Am I under arrest?

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.900
Am I under arrest?

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.900
Am I?

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.600
Get your hands off me
if I'm not under arrest.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.067
If I'm under
arrest, I'll come.

00:17:38.067 --> 00:17:40.300
if I'm not don't
put your hands on me.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.267
Is this the way the
racist government works?

00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:44.200
Don't let a man exercise
his constitutional rights?

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.700
I'd like to make a statement
now with this respect.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.400
Statement of the
Black Panther Party for

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400
Self-Defense.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.667
On the Mulford Act
now pending before the

00:17:50.667 --> 00:17:52.400
California legislature,
the Black Panther Party for

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.367
Self-Defense calls upon the
American people in general

00:17:54.367 --> 00:17:55.800
and the black
people in particular,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.800
to take full note of
the racist California

00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.300
legislature which is now
considering legislation

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.267
aimed at keeping the
black people disarmed and

00:18:01.267 --> 00:18:03.500
powerless at the very
same time that racist police

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.200
agencies throughout the
country are intensifying the

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:06.967
terror, brutality, murder
and repression of black

00:18:06.967 --> 00:18:07.967
people.

00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:09.667
A nation that had grown
used to the nonviolent civil

00:18:09.667 --> 00:18:11.600
rights movement was now
confronted with new images

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.600
of black protest.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.867
Later, at a
Sacramento service station,

00:18:13.867 --> 00:18:15.800
news cameras documented the
continuing debate over law

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.800
and gun.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.300
Ain't no sawed off,
that's a riot shotgun,

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.900
just like yours.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.800
Do you all know the
constitutional rights?

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.400
Sure we do.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:35.367
We're well aware of the
constitutional right -- You

00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:41.367
have no right to take
my gun away from me.

00:18:44.167 --> 00:18:48.600
You breaking the
constitutional rights.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:56.500
The pamphlet says that
the Black Panther Party for

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:03.567
Self-Defense calls on the
American people in general

00:19:03.567 --> 00:19:10.600
to take careful note of
the racist California

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.600
legislature.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:18.567
Why do you believe the
legislature is racist?

00:19:18.567 --> 00:19:21.200
Don't you know?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:27.200
You're a part of it and
obviously this is a white

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.900
system.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:37.067
This is
obviously where we at.

00:19:37.067 --> 00:19:44.100
Do you believe everything
that's in that pamphlet?

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.400
The pamphlet
speaks for itself.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.067
As you see, people didn't
know what to make of these

00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.067
young men and young women.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:03.000
The Panthers go national
immediately following this

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
run-in at the state capitol.

00:20:07.067 --> 00:20:11.400
People are attracted
to the charisma of its

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.800
representatives,
its members.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.767
They're attracted to
the cleverness in the way

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:18.600
they're handling, you know,
the police and authorities

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.700
that don't know what
to make of these folks.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.400
But they're also responding
to the agenda of the Black

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.200
Panthers, and certainly
in, in no small measure,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.400
internationalism.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.400
I want to read to you an
excerpt--and you heard part

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.667
of the Executive Mandate
Number One being read.

00:20:33.667 --> 00:20:36.467
This is what they came
up to Sacramento to,

00:20:36.467 --> 00:20:37.900
to announce.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.667
I want to read to you
a, a longer excerpt.

00:20:41.667 --> 00:20:43.800
"At the same time that
the American Government is

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.600
waging a racist war of
genocide in Vietnam,

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.167
the concencra--concentration
camps in which Japanese

00:20:49.167 --> 00:20:51.600
Americans were interned
during World War II are

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.867
being renovated
and expanded.

00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:56.200
Since America has
historically reserved its

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.800
most barbaric treatment
for non-white people,

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.300
we are forced to conclude
that these concentration

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.600
clamps--camps are being
prepared for black people

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.700
who are determined to gain
their freedom by any means

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:06.700
necessary.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:08.800
The enslavement of
black people from the very

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.200
beginning of this country,
the genocide practiced on

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.500
the American Indians and the
confining of the survivors

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.100
on reservations, the savage
lynching of thousands of

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:18.700
black men and women, the
dropping of atomic bombs on

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.467
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and
now the cowardly massacre in

00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:24.867
Vietnam, all testify to the
fact that toward people of

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.100
color the racist power
structure of America has one

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:29.600
policy:
repression, genocide,

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.000
terror, and the big stick.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.400
Black people have
begged, prayed,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.700
petitioned, demonstrated,
and everything else,

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.900
to get the racist black
power structure of America

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.067
to right the wrongs
which have historically been

00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:42.867
perpetuated
against black people.

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:44.967
All of these efforts
have been answered by more

00:21:44.967 --> 00:21:47.167
repression,
deceit, and hypocrisy.

00:21:47.167 --> 00:21:49.200
As the aggression of the
racist American government

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.900
escalates in Vietnam, the
police agencies of America

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.867
escalate the repression of
black people throughout the

00:21:53.867 --> 00:21:55.267
ghettos of America.

00:21:55.267 --> 00:21:57.000
Vicious police
dogs, cattle prods,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.367
and increased patrols have
become familiar sights in

00:21:59.367 --> 00:22:00.700
black communities.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:02.900
City Hall turns a deaf ear
to the pleas of black people

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.700
for relief from, from
this increasing terror.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.000
The Black--The Black Panther
Party for Self-Defense

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.700
believes that the time has
come for black people to arm

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.500
themselves against this
terror before it is too

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.500
late.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.700
A people who have suffered
so much for so long at the

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.167
hands of a racist
society must draw the line

00:22:18.167 --> 00:22:19.467
somewhere.

00:22:19.467 --> 00:22:21.600
We believe that the black
communities of America must

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.167
rise up as one man to halt
the progression of a trend

00:22:25.167 --> 00:22:28.300
that leads inevitably to
their total destruction."

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.300
Again, an era of
heightened prose,

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.900
certainly, but there's no
doubting that the Panthers

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.267
are tapping into a
nerve that's reverberating

00:22:40.267 --> 00:22:45.200
throughout America,
deepening anxiety of what

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.900
exactly is going
on over in Vietnam,

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.867
deep concern about what's
happening to the young men

00:22:51.867 --> 00:22:56.700
who come back shell shocked,
if not in body bags.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.700
Now so much of the Panthers
is about this bravado,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.200
so much of the Panthers is
about actually doing real

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.667
work on the ground.

00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:14.467
And over the
course of the, of the,

00:23:14.467 --> 00:23:16.767
sort of the, the heightened
moment of the Panthers'

00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:21.200
existence, which is really
about '66 to about '74 in

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.400
terms of its
greatest coherence,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.367
the Panthers are doing
other things as well.

00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:31.100
Yes, there's no doubt that
there are many Panthers who

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.400
are violating the, the
Panther program because they

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.500
were using alcohol
and using drugs.

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:38.300
They were also
selling drugs and,

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.967
you know, en--engaged in
all kinds of things that are

00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:44.967
illegal.

00:23:44.967 --> 00:23:47.400
There's no doubt about that.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.100
This is part of the
thing that infuriates white

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.100
America.

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.300
It's like, "Why are we going
to let these thugs have guns

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.200
for goodness' sakes,
and, and tell our police,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.600
our right-minded
citizens, what to do?"

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.500
But the Panthers were also
doing things on the ground

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.700
that people really
didn't hear about,

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.800
or if they heard
about it, they ignored.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.500
Looking at a
city like Oakland,

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.967
with essentially a ravaged
social services system,

00:24:10.967 --> 00:24:13.967
the Panthers saw the need
for after-school programs

00:24:13.967 --> 00:24:18.200
for black children and
for hot breakfast programs,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.600
things that they just
weren't getting through the

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.067
school system.

00:24:21.067 --> 00:24:24.000
So as the Panthers get
a little more organized

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.200
towards the late
sixties and early seventies,

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.800
you see hot
breakfast programs starting,

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.667
after-school
programs starting,

00:24:30.667 --> 00:24:33.167
you know, basic education,
literacy kind of programs

00:24:33.167 --> 00:24:35.700
starting as well.

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.000
You also see, not
just in Oakland,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.867
but in places
throughout the country,

00:24:39.867 --> 00:24:42.900
with a ranges of success,
Panther health clinics

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.900
opening up.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.300
These are medical
underserved communities.

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.400
And even though we're the
era of the Great Society,

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:55.567
when, when LBJ is trying to
prop up the poorest people

00:24:55.567 --> 00:24:57.800
in the country
across the board,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.600
the quality of healthcare
in black communities was

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.667
abysmal.

00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:03.200
So the Panthers
organized health clinics,

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.200
free health clinics.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.467
You come in--and very
successfully organized

00:25:06.467 --> 00:25:12.300
sickle cell anemia tests,
a disease that afflicts

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:15.900
African Americans
disproportionately in this

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:18.400
country, and the
Panthers would test for it.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.800
And try to find,
to help these,

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.400
these people who get
tested positively,

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.067
to get the medicine they
need to live a life without

00:25:26.067 --> 00:25:28.067
so much discomfort and pain.

00:25:28.067 --> 00:25:31.467
So the Panthers were
doing social service work,

00:25:31.467 --> 00:25:33.767
community
organizing work, certainly.

00:25:33.767 --> 00:25:36.700
They were, in their way,
trying to enforce law and

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:38.500
order, follow
the constitution,

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.000
state constitution as well,
and they were also doing

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.600
those things that
terrified so many Americans,

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.900
in terms of representing
this kind of angry,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.900
violent, hyper-masculinity
and also being involved in,

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.700
in gun and drug trades.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.800
Now Eldridge Cleaver had a
particularly important role

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.600
in cultivating support for
the Panther Party and does a

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.500
lot through Soul on Ice, the
book I've asked you to read

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.700
this week, or read
most of this week.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:22.267
Cleaver is, was,
a petty criminal,

00:26:22.267 --> 00:26:23.700
and if you've
already started the book,

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.100
it's, you know, shocking
that here's a person who

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:30.667
admits to rape and
justifying by prac--or not

00:26:30.667 --> 00:26:34.100
justifying, explained that
he practices on black women

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:36.100
before his plan to
start raping white women.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:43.167
He is, to be as
polite as possible,

00:26:43.167 --> 00:26:44.167
rather homophobic.

00:26:44.167 --> 00:26:48.700
He goes after James Baldwin
in most aggressive ways.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.700
But he's also, he's
also quite brilliant,

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.400
certainly as a
cultural commentator,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.400
cultural critic.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.567
And I want to read a passage
from the book that actually

00:26:58.567 --> 00:27:02.900
helps you understand, or
gives you a sense of the

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:05.000
ways in which that Cleaver,
through Soul on Ice,

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.967
really fascinated a certain
well-heeled part of black

00:27:09.967 --> 00:27:12.900
America--excuse
me, of America,

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:14.600
that really helped the
Panthers onto the road of

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.467
success, at
least for a time.

00:27:17.467 --> 00:27:22.600
And I believe this is from
about page one hundred and

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600
seventy-eight.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.167
It's essentially, I think,
maybe three sentences I want

00:27:26.167 --> 00:27:28.167
to read, but it's one
heck of a series of three

00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:30.167
sentences.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.200
"In the swift fierce
years since the 1954 school

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.300
desegregation decision, a
rash of seemingly unrelated

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.200
mass phenomena has appeared
on the American scene,

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.800
deviating radically from the
prevailing hotdog and malted

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.200
milk norm of the
bloodless, square,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.600
superficial, faceless,
Sunday morning atmosphere

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.200
that was suffocating
the nation's soul.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.200
And all of this in a nation
where the so-called molders

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.500
of public
opinion, the writers,

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.800
politicians, teachers and
cab drivers are willful,

00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.200
euphoric liars or
zip-dam ostriches and owls,

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.767
a clique of
undercover ghosts,

00:27:58.767 --> 00:28:01.000
a bunch of Walter Jenkinses,
a lot of coffee-drinking,

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.700
cigarette-smoking,
sly, suck-assing,

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.000
status-seeking,
cheating, nervous,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.867
dry-balled,
tranquilizer-gulched,

00:28:07.867 --> 00:28:08.867
countdown-minded,
out of style,

00:28:08.867 --> 00:28:09.867
slithering snakes.

00:28:09.867 --> 00:28:10.867
No wonder that
many innocent people,

00:28:10.867 --> 00:28:11.867
the manipulated
and the stimulated,

00:28:11.867 --> 00:28:13.800
some of whom were game for a
reasonable amount of mystery

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.900
and even adventure, had
their minds scrambled.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.100
These observers were not
equipped to either feel or

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.000
know that a radical break,
a revolutionary leap out of

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.967
their sight, had taken place
in the secret parts of this

00:28:22.967 --> 00:28:23.967
nation's soul.

00:28:23.967 --> 00:28:27.000
It was as if a drive--it was
as if a driverless vehicle

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.667
were speeding through
the American night down an

00:28:28.667 --> 00:28:34.667
unlighted street toward a
stone wall and was boarded

00:28:38.967 --> 00:28:41.767
on the fly by a stealthy
ghost with a drooling leer

00:28:41.767 --> 00:28:44.500
on his face, who, at the
last detour before chaos and

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.300
disaster, careened the
vehicle down a smooth

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.300
highway that leads to
the future and life;

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.867
and to ask these Americans
to understand that they were

00:28:50.867 --> 00:28:52.900
the passengers on this
driverless vehicle and that

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.200
the lascivious ghost was the
Saturday night crotchfunk of

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:56.700
the Twist or
the "Yeah, Yeah,

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.700
Yeah!"

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.700
which the Beatles
high-jacked from Ray

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.267
Charles, to ask these
Calvinistic profligates to

00:29:00.267 --> 00:29:02.300
see the logical and
reciprocal links is more

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.300
cruel than asking a
hope-to-die Okie music buff

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.100
to cop the sounds
of John Coltrane."

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.600
It's a heck of
four sentences,

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.600
and really one of the
sharpest cultural critiques

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.400
that I've seen in
quite some time.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.067
Now, taking back to the very
beginning of this course,

00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:16.500
when I talked about the
ironies of John Jack's

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:17.500
existence.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.200
Remember, the, the charcoal
rubbing of the headstone,

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.700
saying that you
couldn't understand,

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.767
you know, American freedom
without understanding

00:29:23.767 --> 00:29:24.767
slavery.

00:29:24.767 --> 00:29:26.767
You might
remember, I forward--I,

00:29:26.767 --> 00:29:28.800
I shot forward two
hundred years to talk about

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.600
Eld--excuse me,
Ralph Ellison,

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.967
saying that southern
whites could not talk,

00:29:32.967 --> 00:29:35.767
sing, walk, make love, or
make war without thinking of

00:29:35.767 --> 00:29:37.600
blacks.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.400
Eldridge Cleaver is
doing the same thing here,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.700
in a very different
voice, very different voice,

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.700
mind you.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.400
But he's telling about this
moment of fascination of

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:49.600
white America,
progressive, left-leaning,

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.600
white America
especially, with blackness.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.900
Part of that fascination
grows out of the martyrdom

00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.200
of folks like
Malcolm X, of course,

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:08.000
Medgar Evers, Emmett Till,
but it also grows out of

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.500
this anxiety about what we
are as a country during the

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.500
Vietnam era.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.500
It grows out of an anxiety
that you see reverberating

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.667
through radical left groups,
largely white groups like

00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:21.667
the Students for a
Democratic Society.

00:30:24.167 --> 00:30:26.167
So the Panthers are
tapping into a nerve.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.100
In fact, a lot of their
funding comes from white

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:38.200
progressives, who are just
completely enthralled by

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.300
what they see as the brutal
honesty of the Panthers.

00:30:43.167 --> 00:30:47.400
Now building off the
Executive Mandate Number One

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.367
incident in Sacramento,
building off of the

00:30:49.367 --> 00:30:52.800
popularity of Soul on
Ice, the Panther Party goes

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.400
national, starts
building itself,

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400
its, its social
service organizations,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.500
its clinics.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.600
But this is not to say
that things go smoothly.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.567
In fact, the Panthers are
one car wreck after another,

00:31:04.567 --> 00:31:06.767
in a sense, as far as its
organization's concerned.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.267
In October of '67, Huey
Newton is arrested in

00:31:14.267 --> 00:31:19.900
Oakland, during a dispute
over which a cop is shot and

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:20.900
dies.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:27.500
He's thrown in jail and
you start having "Free Huey"

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.600
rallies popping up
all over the country.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.100
The phrase "Free Huey"
is in response to this,

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:36.267
knowing he's been
thrown into jail.

00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:39.167
The facts about the
case were murky at best,

00:31:39.167 --> 00:31:42.567
and actually in three years,
he's released from jail,

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:48.200
with the charges dismissed,
something that horrifies

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:49.300
law-and-order types.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.100
But while Huey
Newton's in jail,

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.700
the Panthers want to
see, they need to feel,

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.200
they, they, they recognize
the need to build upon this

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.100
trajectory, upward
trajectory of popularity,

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:06.467
and they reach out to
SNCC, Stokely Carmichael in

00:32:06.467 --> 00:32:07.467
particular.

00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:13.167
And they offer Carmichael
the position of Prime

00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:14.600
Minister of the
Black Panther Party.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.200
You know Carmichael's got
this magnetism that's got

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.200
people excited
about Black Power.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.167
He is being seen by many
people across the political

00:32:26.167 --> 00:32:30.500
spectrum as the heir
apparent of Martin Luther

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:34.500
King and Malcolm X, although
of a different kind of

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.900
politics, but
the heir apparent.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:42.467
The Panthers see SNCC
as a great resource,

00:32:42.467 --> 00:32:44.267
because of
Carmichael's charisma,

00:32:44.267 --> 00:32:47.167
certainly, but also because
SNCC has proven its chops.

00:32:47.167 --> 00:32:50.000
It has organized and
organized and organized and

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.767
has a national structure
already in place that fans

00:32:51.767 --> 00:32:53.767
could, you know, build
into that structure.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.800
SNCC, through
Carmichael's thinking,

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.000
sees that they can tap
into this sort of this heady

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.267
moment in the Panthers, and
their international agenda,

00:33:06.267 --> 00:33:08.967
and build something great.

00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:12.200
The problem, however, is
that Stokely Carmichael,

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:15.167
in a sense, violates the
premise of SNCC that had

00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:18.200
been there for so long, of
group-centered leadership.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.300
He was the head of
SNCC, but you just,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.567
you know, he didn't actually
consult anybody in SNCC

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:25.767
about this affiliation.

00:33:25.767 --> 00:33:27.700
So other SNCC leaders and
people on the ground are

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.367
really, you know, angry.

00:33:29.367 --> 00:33:30.700
Yeah, they kicked
whites out of the movement,

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:32.000
so you might think
they're really on,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.800
in, online, in line
with the Panther ideology,

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.100
but there's no consultation,
so they're upset about that.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.500
And, as it turns out,
because the Panthers were so

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.700
open about courting white
support--through cocktail

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.100
parties, where Eldridge
Cleaver would come up and

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.300
tell, you know, all the
whites in attendance about

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.400
how bad they are,
essentially--because the

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.400
Panthers courted
white support,

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.200
SNCC militants said, "We
have--We've left whites

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.200
behind.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.367
We don't want
anything to do with it."

00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:02.600
So the irony is, you know,
the way we historicize a

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.800
group like the Panthers
who we hear a lot about,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.500
is that, you know,
they're the most militant,

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.900
you know, race nationalist
group on the scene.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:14.900
And SNCC, whom less is
well known about the group,

00:34:17.767 --> 00:34:19.600
of course, but it
turns out that SNCC,

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.267
which starts out
as this, as this,

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:24.700
you know, very polite,
respectable group of college

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.867
kids, white and
black, committed to voter

00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:29.167
registration
drives and leadership

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:31.700
organization--leadership
development,

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:33.867
they says, "To hell
with all of that.

00:34:33.867 --> 00:34:35.100
Whites are out.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.000
It's about a black agenda."

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.600
So the coalition
collapses, and in,

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.167
and in short order,
Carmichael is essentially

00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:47.067
forced out of SNCC because
he's now gone far afield of

00:34:47.067 --> 00:34:53.067
what SNCC has
actually--has become.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:02.600
So the Panthers--now we're
in early 1968--are trying to

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.100
make sense of themselves
as an organization.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:11.100
Over the course of the
next five or six years,

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.600
they implode time and again.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.167
Huey Newton develops an
incredibly damaging drug

00:35:17.167 --> 00:35:20.400
habit and as the nominal
leader of SNCC starts

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400
purging people.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.100
He kicks out Bobby Seale;
that's one of his first

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.100
targets.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.867
Huey Newton, you know,
coalesces power around

00:35:26.867 --> 00:35:28.000
himself.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.100
He's purged
people left and right.

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.367
It's almost like, you know,
these stereotypes of this,

00:35:31.367 --> 00:35:34.067
of a demagogue
gone a bit crazy.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:40.800
Eldridge Cleaver
leaves for exile.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:50.400
Seale is disillusioned;
he's left the Panther Party.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.000
You have battles developing
with other grassroots

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.167
groups, like the
group called US,

00:35:58.167 --> 00:36:00.300
based out of--essentially
based out of UCLA in Los

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.000
Angeles, under the
leadership of Maulana

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.800
Karenga, a cultural
nationalist group that wants

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.700
to align with the
Black Panther Party,

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.200
but the Panthers
are internationally,

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.400
politically nationalist,
not culturally nationalist.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.667
And there's a gun battle in
Westwood on UCLA's campus

00:36:17.667 --> 00:36:20.667
between the radicals and
US, the group called US,

00:36:20.667 --> 00:36:24.200
and the Black--members of
the Black Panther Party.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:30.200
And then seeding discord
this whole time as well are

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.200
external forces, like
especially an FBI program

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.367
called COINTELPRO,
Counterintelligence Program,

00:36:38.367 --> 00:36:40.367
COINTELPRO.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.600
COINTELPRO started, I
think, in the fifties or so,

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.467
as an
anti-counter--anti-radical

00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:52.567
group, but really gets
focused on the Black

00:36:52.567 --> 00:36:54.367
Panthers more
than anybody else,

00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:56.800
any other organization
in the late sixties.

00:37:00.767 --> 00:37:03.900
The task of COINTELPRO
was to infiltrate the

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.800
Panthers--they were trying
to infiltrate everybody,

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.967
but really focused on the
Panthers--infiltrate the

00:37:09.967 --> 00:37:11.767
Panthers,
spread lies, rumors,

00:37:11.767 --> 00:37:18.100
and discord and watch the
Panthers destroy themselves.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:23.400
It turns out they were
awfully successful at it.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.167
The Panthers, as they
uncover one informant after

00:37:26.167 --> 00:37:29.100
another, or one suspected
informant after another,

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.367
start to implode
in places, in,

00:37:32.367 --> 00:37:36.300
in Detroit, in Chicago,
all throughout the country.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.867
No one could be trusted.

00:37:37.867 --> 00:37:39.667
It didn't help that
Huey Newton is sort of

00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:41.667
drug-addled as well.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.600
This most amazing moment
for the Panthers' existence

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.567
really is short-lived,
two or three years,

00:37:50.567 --> 00:37:52.400
before this really starts
to happ--starts to become

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400
unspooled.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.200
And actually, we can
get into the 1970s,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.167
women are
running the Panthers,

00:37:58.167 --> 00:38:02.000
and that's when there's the
most success with the school

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.567
lunch programs,
these after-school

00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:05.100
programs--school lunch--hot
breakfast programs,

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.767
excuse me,
after-school programs,

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:08.367
and health clinics
really take off in the early

00:38:08.367 --> 00:38:09.367
seventies as well.

00:38:09.367 --> 00:38:15.367
So these are a number of the
events that take us through

00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:26.500
the late 1960s and into,
into the early seventies.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.267
By '73, '74, the Panthers
are essentially defunct.

00:38:30.267 --> 00:38:32.400
There's still chapters
around throughout--I mean

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.600
they never--there hasn't
been a moment when there

00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:39.900
have been no--there hasn't
been a moment--I'm trying to

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.200
think this through double
and triple negatives here.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:43.800
There have always
been Panther chapters,

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:45.367
since the
Panthers were organized.

00:38:45.367 --> 00:38:48.100
And you have Panther
chapters now called the Gray

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.100
Panthers.

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.900
You know, these are
folks who are now,

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.400
you know, sixty and
seventy years old,

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.067
who have not given up on the
militant--militant attitudes

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:59.900
and progressive critiques,
who are trying to organize

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.667
themselves.

00:39:01.667 --> 00:39:05.167
But the--it was a
flash, a moment in,

00:39:05.167 --> 00:39:08.800
in time, a brief moment,
with the Panthers as sort of

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.900
this, this group that
claimed so much fascination

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:18.000
with the American
public and fear as well.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.567
Now in talking about
the Panthers in this way,

00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:25.200
'66 through the
end of the decade,

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.600
I've left out a whole other
narrative that's really

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:33.900
quite critical, upon which
the Panthers are sort of

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.200
based its foundation.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.167
It's really a
narrative of the North.

00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:39.867
The Panthers are
overwhelmingly an urban

00:39:39.867 --> 00:39:43.000
group, organization and
a northern and western

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.167
organization,
based in Oakland,

00:39:45.167 --> 00:39:49.300
but, you know, you can see
them through urban enclaves

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:55.300
throughout the
northeast, Midwest as well.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.900
This is a moment in
the late sixties,

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.000
heading into the
early seventies,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.500
of, as I said,
confusion and dismay.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:06.100
And it's a moment of Martin
Luther King taking up the

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:10.800
final battles of his
life from '66 to '68,

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.267
as he takes the
movement north,

00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:14.900
the movement--SCLC
takes it north,

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.800
to engage in new battles.

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.867
Fame--Most famously, he
takes the battle to Chicago.

00:40:19.867 --> 00:40:22.900
And that's what I'll
actually spend most of the

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.000
lecture on,
discussion on, on Wednesday.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.600
But I want to maybe
wrap things up here,

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.300
it's a couple of
minutes early actually,

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.000
with a reference to a
poem that might frame this a

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
little bit.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.800
It's a poem by
the late poet,

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.767
Gwendolyn Brooks,
one of the great,

00:40:42.767 --> 00:40:46.500
one of the great
American poets.

00:40:48.767 --> 00:40:50.800
She writes a poem
called "We Real Cool."

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.267
When asked about the
poem--this was written in

00:40:54.267 --> 00:40:55.267
1966.

00:40:55.267 --> 00:40:58.567
This is why I'm reading--I'm
bringing this up now,

00:40:58.567 --> 00:40:59.567
I'm sorry.

00:40:59.567 --> 00:41:02.000
When writes about the
poem--when asked about the

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.200
poem, Brooks had the
following to say: "I wrote

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.600
it because I was
passing by a pool hall in my

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:10.900
neighborhood in Chicago one
afternoon and I saw--well,

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.700
as I said in the poem,
seven boys shooting pool.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.467
And I'd wondered how
they felt about themselves,

00:41:16.467 --> 00:41:19.200
and I decided that they felt
they were not quite valid;

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.300
that they certainly--that
they certainly were

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:23.867
insecure.

00:41:23.867 --> 00:41:26.400
They were not cherished by
the society and therefore

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.100
they would feel
that they should,

00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:31.767
well, spit in the face
of the establishment.

00:41:31.767 --> 00:41:34.567
I used the month of June
as a symbol--as a symbol,

00:41:34.567 --> 00:41:37.467
an establishment symbol,
whereas the rest of us love

00:41:37.467 --> 00:41:39.500
and respect June and wait
for it to come so we can

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.000
enjoy it, they
should jazz June,

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.300
derange it, scratch in it,
do anything that would annoy

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.000
the establishment."

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.567
This is Brooks's poem.

00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:50.967
It's very short.

00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:52.900
We real cool.

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.267
We Left school.

00:41:54.267 --> 00:41:57.600
We Lurk late.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.900
We Strike straight.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.000
We Sing sin.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.200
We Thin gin.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.500
We Jazz June.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:07.800
We Die soon.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:13.100
It's a poem that starts
out with an assertion of,

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.700
you know, cool
aesthetic that we would see

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.867
reverberating
through the Panthers,

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:23.100
certainly, that quickly
moves through the despair of

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:26.000
living in an inner-city in
an African American enclave,

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.300
caught up in
drinking and games.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.000
Caught up in an
anti-establishment ethos,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.200
as she mentioned in
describing the poem,

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.800
but then ultimately
caught up in a moment,

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:40.667
a language of despair
and of hopelessness.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:43.900
"We jazz June.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.900
We die soon."

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.167
Although King doesn't
know that he's going to be

00:42:52.167 --> 00:42:56.100
assassinated, what you see
in the final two years of

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.867
his life, someone who
was truly establishment,

00:42:59.867 --> 00:43:04.200
Martin Luther
King, certainly,

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.500
you see in the last two
years of his life sort of a

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:11.000
reckoning with the
intransigence of certain

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.300
problems in the North that
create a mindset where you

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.167
have young men who
are hopeless in the

00:43:17.167 --> 00:43:18.900
possibilities
for the future,

00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.867
and of course,
like the young men,

00:43:20.867 --> 00:43:22.567
he too would die soon.

00:43:22.567 --> 00:43:25.700
And we'll pick up that
narrative on Wednesday.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.700
Thank you.

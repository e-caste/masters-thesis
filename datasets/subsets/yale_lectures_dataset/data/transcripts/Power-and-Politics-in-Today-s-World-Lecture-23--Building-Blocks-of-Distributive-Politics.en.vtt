00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.290
- So we're now on the, into the fifth part

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.463
of the course called, what is to be done?

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.650
And I want to just begin by talking about

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.410
the key features of the
politics of insecurity,

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.980
some of which we addressed
earlier in the course

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.850
and some in the last two lectures.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.180
But they really shape
the landscape on which

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.420
we have to think about,
what can and cannot

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.090
be done in politics, in
the world as we actually

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.480
find it.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.253
And so, first thinking about voters.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.200
One thing that we have learned is that

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.610
local inequalities matter
to people much more

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.430
than global inequalities.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.690
Bernie Sanders can talk
as much as he likes about

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.930
the top 1% and it will motivate activists

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.150
on the left of the Democratic party

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.720
but most voters really
care about much more local

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.710
inequalities.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.720
And we talked about this
earlier in the course

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.880
when we were talking
about how capuchin monkey

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.370
experiment was misinterpreted when the

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.640
angry monkey was likened to
the Wall Street protester

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.430
but whether the monkey was
angry because she or he

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.090
was not getting something
that a similarly situated

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.960
monkey was getting.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.167
The monkey was not troubled
that the researcher

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:46.167
had a big bowl of grapes and cucumbers.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.950
So people tend to compare
themselves to similarly

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.509
situated others.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.370
Oil workers might compare
themselves to coal miners.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.100
Auto workers might compare themselves to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.020
steel workers.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.720
And this is true up and
down the occupational scale.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.530
I think I mentioned to you, a professor

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.240
would be much more troubled to learn

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.927
that she or he is paid significantly less

00:02:11.927 --> 00:02:16.530
than say, $10,000 less than
a professor in the next

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.980
office than to learn
they're paid half a million

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.790
dollars less than the attorney next door.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.560
So people tend to make local comparisons.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.670
And the idea that marked hope for,

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.280
that people would start
to make more global

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.660
comparisons, is not
supported by the research

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.300
of sociologists and social psychologists.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.470
Secondly, think about
Rick Santelli's rant,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.320
another illustration of this point.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.772
This is the famous rant
on the Chicago Mercantile

00:02:49.772 --> 00:02:53.817
Exchange right after
the Obama Administration

00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:57.850
came into office and had
started talking about

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.120
minor mortgage relief for homeowners.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.160
Nothing like John
Geanakoplos was proposing,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.290
but nonetheless he was proposing reducing

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.870
interest rates at least
for a time on peoples loans

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.430
and it produced a lot of
rage that was articulated

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.418
in that video I showed you.

00:03:17.418 --> 00:03:21.480
At the end of it, his
calling for a tea party

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.177
and people credit the formation
of the tea party with...

00:03:29.107 --> 00:03:34.107
As being, if you like,
catalyzed by Rick Santelli's

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.100
rant on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.230
And you might also recall
that one of the things

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.390
he complained about was, he
said, it's a moral hazard.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.410
It's a moral hazard.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.630
But notice of course,
bailing out the banks

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.850
is also a moral hazard, right?

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.480
Bailing out the banks is
giving banks the incentive

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.930
to gamble with taxpayer's money.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.140
So while it may be a
moral hazard to bail out

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.220
the homeowner's, it's
no less, you might say

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.110
in some ways it's more
consequential moral hazard

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.180
to bail out the banks.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.620
Nonetheless, what enraged him was that

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.660
do you wanna pay for your
neighbor's mortgage?,

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.040
he rhetorically said.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.783
So again, local comparisons
that matter to people.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.070
Think about the difference
between the Trump

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.203
and Sander's campaigns on this question of

00:04:28.203 --> 00:04:31.913
who people compare themselves with.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.170
In many ways Trump and
Sanders ran a populist

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:38.733
campaigns in the 2016 election.

00:04:38.733 --> 00:04:43.733
They attacked Wall Street
elites for being corrupt.

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:49.080
But a difference was that Sanders talked

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.770
a lot about inequality
whereas Trump did not.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.000
Trump never promised to reduce inequality.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.610
He never, as I said, even said

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.361
what Ronald Reagan had said, that he wants

00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:03.870
America to be a country in which everybody

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.245
can get rich.

00:05:05.245 --> 00:05:09.751
All he said was that, you
people have been screwed.

00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:11.940
You people have been...

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.760
Left behind by the...

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.040
By the policies of foolish elites,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.400
he calls everybody idiots.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.500
And I'm gonna put America first and so on.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.960
And to the extent there
was a fairness argument.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.868
We talked about this in connection with

00:05:30.868 --> 00:05:33.240
Arlie Hochschild's
narrative of cutting in.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.160
Some people have cut in front of me

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.460
and taken something that I would otherwise

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.880
have gotten, right?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.780
Again, very local comparisons that people

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.613
are making.

00:05:43.613 --> 00:05:46.760
They are not thinking about what people,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.757
very distant from them
in the socioeconomic

00:05:49.757 --> 00:05:52.233
order are making.

00:05:53.243 --> 00:05:56.280
Related to that, closely related to that

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.160
is a loss aversion and in its insecurity,

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.160
often matter much more to
people than inequality.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.363
Again, think here of Trump's
make America great again.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.590
Something's been taken away from you.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.740
We're gonna bring it
back and do something.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.450
We're gonna recreate something
that had existed before.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.170
I am gonna bring back those jobs.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.290
I'm not gonna make you rich.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.140
I'm gonna bring back those jobs.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.870
That was the essence of his campaign

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.760
whereas Hilary's was, she
took that other Reagan line,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.050
American's best days are ahead.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.830
Sunny optimism which is
a lot harder to sustain

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.830
during an era of endemic
employment insecurity.

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.890
And again, just driving
home the point that

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.090
it's insecurity and the
fear of downward mobility

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.610
that matters much more to
people than their place

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.660
in the distribution of income and wealth,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.210
globally conceived.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.830
Remember those data about
Trump primary voters.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.440
Only a third of whom earned
lower than the median income,

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.302
below $50,000 a head per family.

00:07:15.302 --> 00:07:20.190
Another, 2nd and 3rd earned
between the median income

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.830
and 100,000, and the third
third of primary voters

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:27.510
not Republican voters
in the general election

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.170
were Trump supporters.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:33.657
And in those primaries, so, again,

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.400
middle-class people who feel insecure,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.910
and this is, what Dan
Markovits' book is about,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.209
may be just as anxious and mobilizable

00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:51.890
by a populist politician as poor people

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.943
who feel insecure.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.130
So the insecurity and
loss aversion matter more

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.320
than inequality and
it's local inequalities

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.543
that matter much more to
people than global ones.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.200
And then we're living in a world in which

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.070
almost everywhere
organized labor is weaker

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.950
than it's been in decades.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.650
We've seen, in country after country,

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.018
the decline of union
movements, it's way down

00:08:21.018 --> 00:08:23.900
into single digits, in the US,

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.440
and the majority of workers that are

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.580
organized now are in public sector unions

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.570
which do have some political clout.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:37.270
We will see next week when
we talk about education.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.080
But for the most part,
as a force in politics,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.080
unions have seldom been as weak, if ever,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.093
in the last 80 or 90 years, if ever,

00:08:53.868 --> 00:08:56.550
as they are today.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.680
This is particularly pronounced in the US,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.700
but we saw pretty much everywhere except

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:05.410
one or two places like
Finland and Iceland, we've

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.070
seen a decline in the
power of organized labor.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.460
A concomitant to that, business interests

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:17.960
are stronger than
they've been for decades.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.210
Partly because of the
collapse of a serious

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.390
alternative out there.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.920
Communism to the extent
it exists politically

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.640
is now supported by capitalists economies

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.330
in places like China and
Vietnam and so there's

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.680
no real alternative to
capitalism out there,

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:43.930
which obviously, greatly,
increases the power

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:45.510
of capital.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.200
Particularly in an era of globalization

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.260
when it can easily flee, the flying East

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.080
theory that Christina talked about in

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.253
the China lecture.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:02.090
And in these, as jobs going
increasingly to technology,

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.260
capital doesn't even need to flee in order

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:10.140
to increase its leverage over labor.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.450
So we're living in a world in which labor

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.420
is weaker than its been in living memory

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.870
and business interests are more powerful

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.750
than they've been in living memory.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.690
And then coming to Thursdays lecture

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.128
of last week, we're also living in a world

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:31.440
in which political
parties have become weaker

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.460
and more fragmented just about everywhere.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.840
And this is not something that has gone on

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.730
for eight decades, but it certainly has

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:44.960
gone on over the past
four decades as labor

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.690
has become weaker, parties on the left

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.740
have fragmented and we saw that

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.208
as induced fragmentation on the right

00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:57.440
in multi-party systems and
all over the democratic

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.280
world, this impulse to
democratize parties,

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.070
to get more and more direct democracy in

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.430
the governance of parties, and in making

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.970
of decisions has greatly weakened parties

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.830
in both multi-party systems and even

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:16.110
two-party systems and indeed, even the...

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.040
The platonic form of what used to be

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.080
two-party systems.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.280
The Westminster system between their

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.854
going for referendum between the changes

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:30.731
in their leadership selection rules,

00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:34.320
between adopting things
like fixed parliaments

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.360
and candidate selection
also being decentralized,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.040
they have replicated much of the rest of

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.420
the democratic world in
making it much more difficult

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.770
for parties to present, get elected on

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:52.410
programmatic platforms
and then implement them

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.273
as governments.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.170
It's a world that's ripe
for populist charlatans

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.170
who exploit insecurity and
promise snake oil solutions.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.243
So, what is to be done?

00:12:09.243 --> 00:12:11.050
Now at the beginning of the course

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.699
when I prefaced some of these themes,

00:12:14.699 --> 00:12:17.481
in the first few lectures, I also said

00:12:17.481 --> 00:12:20.075
don't get too depressed.

00:12:20.075 --> 00:12:21.971
(class laughing)

00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:26.971
And in many respects, this
is a depressing prospect.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.590
But what I want to be arguing in these

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.050
last lectures is that,
certainly we shouldn't

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.310
give up hope and there
are ways of thinking

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:41.190
constructively about
politics going forward.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:44.150
And indeed, in some
respects, there are reasons

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:47.810
not just for hope but even some optimism.

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.280
This was a distinction
Martin Luther King made

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.530
towards the end of his life.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.300
He said he was no longer optimistic

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.883
but he hadn't given up hope.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.350
I think there are some reasons to think

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.540
that it might be possible to come up with

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.883
constructive change and
build regressive support

00:13:05.883 --> 00:13:07.830
for it to happen.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:12.233
And so that's where we're
headed in these final lectures.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:17.940
So, a central message of this final part

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.850
of the course, and if
you like, presupposition

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.960
of much that I'm gonna
say to you, power phrasing

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.140
Immanuel Kant is that,
policy without politics

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.923
is empty, but politics
with policy is blind.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.230
Policy, politics without policy is empty

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:43.430
and politics without policy is blind.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.830
So, let me emphasize that it's not just

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.320
in the real world but in
the academic literature,

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.950
for the most part, people who study policy

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:57.670
don't think very much about politics.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.220
They think about what
policies would be good,

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.640
what should happen.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.270
But they have relatively little to say

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.253
about how they're gonna get it to happen.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:12.760
Whereas people who study politics

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.440
tend to explain why what happens happens

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.130
but have way little to say
about what should happen.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:24.130
And so there's this sort of
divergence of preoccupations.

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.210
But I think that that is misguided.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.880
That we really need to think about what's

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.650
desirable in the context
of what's feasible

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:38.650
and take into account the constraints

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.620
and possibilities that might be offered

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.140
for thinking about policy rather than

00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.563
thinking about it in a vacuum.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.060
So just to give a couple of illustrations

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.850
of policy without politics.

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.370
Perhaps the most influential
book of political economy

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.280
written in the last couple of decades is

00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:07.650
Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.760
This is the book in which he argues that

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.220
the reason for increasing inequality

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.607
is that returns to capital exceed returns

00:15:18.607 --> 00:15:21.360
to the other factors of production.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.620
And so, wealth accumulates over time

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.083
at the top.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.650
Economists debate his data and some ways

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.330
of measuring this but
that's not my concern here.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.070
The other one I wanna just mention to you

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.110
as examples of these brilliant economists,

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.627
there's no question about
that, but the things

00:15:42.627 --> 00:15:45.360
that he says about politics are...

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.687
Bereft if any serious attention as to how

00:15:53.687 --> 00:15:56.030
they might be enacted.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.973
So for example, in his
book published in 2014,

00:15:59.973 --> 00:16:02.780
in the penultimate chapter of that book,

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:06.983
he calls for aggressive
tax on global capital.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.810
And in the beginning of that chapter

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:15.810
he does say, well this
might be a utopian idea.

00:16:15.883 --> 00:16:18.160
But we should still put it out there

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.690
for thinking about where we want to get to

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:24.010
and besides, it could
inform more realistic

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:29.010
proposals like a
Europe-wide tax on capital.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.143
Now you might say, well in 2014,

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:39.130
that wasn't, you know,
it might not have seemed

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:42.120
a naive thing to say,
as naive a thing to say

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:47.120
as it is today, but nonetheless,

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:54.070
in 2018 he has pushed this
idea further with some other

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.170
intellectuals in Europe, publishing what

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:01.200
they call our Manifesto
for the Democratization

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.270
of Europe, and you can
find it and peruse it

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:07.300
at your leisure on their website.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.210
They're calling for the creation of a new

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:14.383
European assembly that would essentially

00:17:14.383 --> 00:17:17.990
function as a European-wide parliament

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.270
that would have powers to raise revenue

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:25.820
and manage budgets and it would be...

00:17:27.592 --> 00:17:31.440
The idea is that 80% of the legislators

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:34.300
would be elected in the national elections

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:38.390
so when you vote for your MP in the UK

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.626
or Austria, they would
also, not only would they

00:17:42.626 --> 00:17:45.870
go to the British or Austrian parliament,

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.750
they would also participate in this new

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.440
European assembly.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.430
80% of them would come there.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:55.490
The others would come from
the European parliament

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.170
by proportional allocation.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:04.100
And they portray this as an alternative

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.130
to the current EU structures
which are so constrained

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:13.130
by the treaty-based character
of the European union

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.363
which I lectured to you
about some months ago.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.550
But what do they ignore in proposing this?

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:25.380
Why is it that the Lisbon Treaty ended up

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.510
with a treaty-based system?

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.430
It was because the more
ambitious proposals

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.590
envisaged at Maastricht
were roundly rejected

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.710
in referendums in Europe.

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.910
And so they had to
actually cancel a number of

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:44.990
the plan referendums
because they saw the whole

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.990
project of a never closer
union heading for catastrophe.

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.750
And so they retreated.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.890
The Lisbon Treaty is really a retreat back

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.200
to the idea that while EU is essentially

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.430
a system of intergovernmental treaties

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.270
in its ultimate legitimacy.

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:07.410
They also argue that the purpose

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.070
of this new European parliament is to do

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:12.810
things like reduce inequality within

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:14.430
the member countries.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.700
But why, if the member
countries in their own

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.820
parliaments can't reduce inequality,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.210
why would anyone think
that sending them to

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.560
a European parliament would enable them

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.413
to reduce inequality any more effectively?

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.730
So, and if you go and read the website

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:37.850
that they have there,
which I urge you to do.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:40.090
It's certainly an
imaginative and interesting

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:43.208
proposal in an intellectual sense,

00:19:43.208 --> 00:19:46.010
you will find the thing I said you should

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.340
always be careful of.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.560
Or should make you watch your wallet.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.370
The vast majority of it is written

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:52.940
in a passive voice.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.790
The vast majority of it said
about what should happen.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.470
What should occur.

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.053
What needs to happen.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.430
But of course, we can
talk until we're blue

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.990
in the face about what needs to happen

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.030
without having anything
to say about how to make

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:10.863
it happen.

00:20:10.863 --> 00:20:13.920
What will be the political
forces that are gonna

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.910
produce an outcome of this kind?

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.210
And when you think back to the literature

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.920
on the European Union, Tony Judt published

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.920
his book in 2006,
post-war, when he warned.

00:20:28.266 --> 00:20:30.940
He said, the problem
with the European Union

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.600
is that it's been an elite
project from beginning

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.600
until end and as soon as
it gets into any trouble

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.280
the popular resentment
of European-wide politics

00:20:46.239 --> 00:20:51.239
is going to erupt and it's
not gonna be pretty to see.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.530
He turned out to be right about that.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.470
Adam Tooze in Crash
gives chapter and verse

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:02.470
of the inability of the
European governing structures

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.620
to come up with policies
that the populations

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.620
in the constituent
countries will live with.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:16.620
And so, the nationalists of the countries

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.200
within the European Union is very powerful

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.660
in the idea that it's going
to go away anytime soon,

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.630
I think is implausible.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.250
And I gave you a reason, if you think back

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.540
to my lecture.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.510
Among the reasons is that the Europeans

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.610
have contracted out their security to NATO

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:42.450
over these past several decades whereas

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:46.372
in the American case, what
built a sense of national

00:21:46.372 --> 00:21:51.020
purpose when we transitioned
from the Confederacy

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.450
to the Constitution was the
creation of a National Defense

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.360
and the funding of
Central National Defense.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.550
And then the idea that
people would identify

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:05.550
with the national project rather than,

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.300
what we might call the federal project,

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.920
rather than the states,
that was a transition

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.450
that was set in motion
by the centralization

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.652
of our power over national security in

00:22:20.652 --> 00:22:23.980
the American system at the
time of the Constitution.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.940
There's never been an analog of that

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.600
and so the idea of an ever closer union

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.050
has largely been a fantasy
of elites for which

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.640
popular support has never been dealt

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.320
and indeed is less likely
to be forthcoming today

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:45.350
than it has been since anytime since

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.150
the financial crisis.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.930
So the idea that we can
now create a new European

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.540
parliament that, as they argue in cases

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:00.540
of disagreement would
actually trump the decisions

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:06.562
of the European Union
who which are constrained

00:23:06.562 --> 00:23:11.562
by the treaty-based
caricature that strengthens

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.390
national parliament I think is,

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:17.243
it's an example of policy

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.643
without politics being ultimately empty.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.770
What about politics without policy?

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.710
Well we have examples of that.

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:32.267
Just to give one here.

00:23:32.267 --> 00:23:34.552
(drum music)

00:23:34.552 --> 00:23:36.960
(crowd chanting)

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.853
- [All] Occupy Wall
Street all day, all week.

00:23:39.853 --> 00:23:41.790
Occupy Wall Street.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.230
- It's our duty as Americans to fight

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.310
for our country and to keep it,

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.590
you know, true to serving its people.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:49.750
And when it doesn't do that,

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.740
it's immoral not to stand
up and say something.

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.220
- I'm here myself as a free individual

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.080
to humanize the markets and to have

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.610
true participatory democracy.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.470
Bottom up democracy.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:05.890
And to make Wall Street hear the sound

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.915
of what democracy means.

00:24:07.915 --> 00:24:09.403
- What kind of power?

00:24:09.403 --> 00:24:10.820
- [All] People power.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.310
- Wall Street, it crashes, and you know,

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.020
people start, people lose their jobs

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.960
and things like that.

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.931
We're very angry at Wall Street.

00:24:17.931 --> 00:24:19.152
It's a part of capitalism,
American capitalism

00:24:19.152 --> 00:24:20.786
especially, that's why we're here today...

00:24:20.786 --> 00:24:21.870
At Wall Street.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.210
- There's no reason to not be peaceful.

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:24.810
We just wanna get a point across.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.640
We're just trying to let people know

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.010
what's going on and why we're here for it.

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.360
- One in seven children
in the United States

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.520
suffer from hunger, at
the same time we're giving

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:35.550
billions and almost
trillions to Wall Street

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.700
just for bailouts.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:37.850
Something needs to change.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.764
We need an economy for the people

00:24:39.764 --> 00:24:40.771
and by the people.

00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:42.200
Not by the rich and for the rich.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.560
- I mean, and the
government's doing the work

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.220
for us, all they have
to do is cut some more

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.920
people's insurance, unemployment benefits

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.490
and it won't be a bunch
of 20-year old white

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.040
college students out here, you know?

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.550
- What would make today a success?

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:54.050
What kinds of changes
would you like to see

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:56.550
as a result of everyone
demonstrating today?

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.080
- A success, it's already happening.

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.850
They corral the bull.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:05.023
And that's pretty much a
huge symbolic statement.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.763
- So there you have it.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.910
This is the beginning of
the Occupy Wall Street

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:15.743
Movement.

00:25:15.743 --> 00:25:20.470
It was a movement that
was famously uninterested

00:25:21.305 --> 00:25:24.500
in articulating particular policies,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.320
in organizing itself behind
any particular agenda,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.420
but rather its purpose was to express this

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.673
moral outrage at the
bailing out of the financial

00:25:36.673 --> 00:25:41.280
crisis and the inability
of the Obama Administration

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.540
to do much else.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.220
They were to some extent triggered by

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.150
the Arab Spring Movement
which had gotten going

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.410
that year.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:56.410
But they really didn't advocate
any particular policies.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.630
And indeed if you think about...

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.983
If you think about the
decision to occupy Wall Street,

00:26:04.866 --> 00:26:08.120
it was, you know, unlike,
at least the Vietnam

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.620
protesters went to
Washington where something

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.280
might be done about it.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.780
Whereas, here they went to New York

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:19.478
and then spent the following Fall on many

00:26:19.478 --> 00:26:24.210
town and village greens around the country

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.750
but because they lacked
organization or leadership

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:32.810
or resources, once the cold weather came,

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.560
they soon faded away.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.460
Now, this doesn't mean
that they were irrelevant

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:39.910
to American politics.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.083
They articulated a moral
narrative that was,

00:26:44.083 --> 00:26:48.000
that had a certain kind
of coherence to it.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.957
You might call it a
reactive moral narrative

00:26:49.957 --> 00:26:52.260
but I'm gonna have some more to say

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.050
about the importance of moral narratives

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.750
in effective distributed
politics later this morning.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:03.230
But they had nothing else.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.430
They had nothing more
than a moral narrative.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.740
And moral narratives on
their own is not enough.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.740
Again, this is politics without policy.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.980
So my agenda today is to get us

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:22.780
to start thinking about
how, we can think about

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.488
how there can be effective
policies in light

00:27:25.488 --> 00:27:28.791
of what we do know about politics.

00:27:28.791 --> 00:27:33.791
And one phrase that falls to mind is in

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.820
one of John Rawls's less famous writings,

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.590
his Law of Peoples it comes from,

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:44.510
I believe, the way he first used it,

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.620
this is the idea of Realistic Utopianism.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:52.070
And so, the thing about being a realist,

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:56.820
about politics, in the real
politics sense of realist

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:00.970
it is the danger of being
a realist is it might

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:05.394
prevent you from trying
to do things that will

00:28:05.394 --> 00:28:07.853
change reality, right?

00:28:08.925 --> 00:28:12.530
That you'll be so constrained by one sense

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:15.610
of the politic, you know, the politics

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:16.950
is the art of the possible.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.720
You'll be so constrained by the notion

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.010
of what's possible that you won't push

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:26.113
for policies that might
change what's possible, right?

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.080
So that...

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.890
I think we actually say in our book

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:36.010
on the Death by a Thousand Cuts that

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:39.160
real political creativity gets people

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.970
to think that what they
had previously regarded

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.330
as impossible is in fact possible, right?

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:50.020
That's, you know, you wanna use

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.060
the buzz words.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.990
You wanna push the envelope.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.630
Think outside the box.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.920
You've heard them all before.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.690
And if you're very
constrained in your thinking

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:03.002
about what appears to be feasible

00:29:03.002 --> 00:29:06.450
in politics as we know
it today, you will not

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.820
push to change the boundaries of what

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.748
is possible in politics today.

00:29:15.748 --> 00:29:18.773
And so you run a risk
of being, if you like,

00:29:20.052 --> 00:29:24.352
captive of the inability
to think imaginatively

00:29:24.352 --> 00:29:29.080
about ways to change what is possible.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.010
And so I like this phrase
realistic utopianism

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.230
in that, it conjures up the idea of trying

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:40.560
to get to a better
place but thinking about

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.420
the steps from here to there.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.030
You've gotta think about
how you're gonna join

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:45.950
the dots.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.790
How you're gonna in fact get policies

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.536
adopted that might change the politics

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:56.680
on the ground, which I think
is conspicuously missing

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.105
in the proposal for European parliament

00:29:59.105 --> 00:30:01.200
that we just talked about.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.003
And so to make that case,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.950
what I'm gonna do today and then I'm gonna

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:11.400
use this framework in
our remaining lectures is

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.430
talk about what I'm gonna
call building blocks

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:18.480
of effective distributive politics.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.670
And there are six of them.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.021
And I'm gonna spend a little bit of time

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.923
on each of them.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:31.063
And I will start with coalitions.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.420
Very important in politics
to think about coalitions.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.160
And the reason it's
very important politics

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.060
to think about coalitions
goes back to our discussion

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:50.060
of the differences between
the median voter story

00:30:50.256 --> 00:30:53.810
and the majority rule divide
the dollar game, right?

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:57.660
So just to remind you,
the median voter story

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:02.200
created the expectation that
because the median voter

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.620
is always below the mean
voter, there would be

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:07.450
downwardly distribution of wealth

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:11.930
because politicians in search
of the median voter would

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:18.050
advocate policies that the
median voter would prefer.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:23.050
And that was the fear of
19th century liberals.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.410
It was the hope of Marx in his later years

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.710
when he started talking
about the parliamentary

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:31.300
road to socialism and it's embodied in

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.030
the median voter theorem.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.890
The puzzle was that it doesn't happen

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.750
in any kind of systematic way.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.110
And we thought one
reason for that might be

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.000
that there's another
dimension such as race

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.430
that people care about more.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.510
And we talked about
Nixon's southern strategy

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.090
in connection with all of that.

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:54.310
But then we talked about
the majority rule divide.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:56.880
A dollar game where we saw even without

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.880
the 2nd dimension any distribution

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.640
of income can be upset by majority rule.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.390
All you need is three
people and you're off

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:12.850
to the races with the potential, right?

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.860
So another way of putting
it is that the median

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.910
voter theorem assumes
that all of these people

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:20.773
are gonna vote together.

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:24.210
But in fact, you might
get a coalition between

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:27.410
the rich and the poor
against the middle class.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.090
So you might get all kinds of coalitions.

00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:32.730
And that means that no...

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.370
No distribution of income and wealth is

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:44.360
not potentially vulnerable to being upset

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.810
by majority rule.

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:48.870
And an example of this, we spent some time

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.310
on early in the course, was the campaign

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.683
to repeal the estate tax
which is just about money.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.158
It was just one divisible good.

00:32:58.158 --> 00:33:02.490
And so, that's clearly not the case that

00:33:04.536 --> 00:33:07.460
a 2nd dimension or anything like that

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:09.910
producing the instability.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.740
So, coalitions are really important.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.223
You have to think about what coalitions

00:33:16.223 --> 00:33:19.500
are going to support, what it is that

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.590
you're trying to achieve,
and you've gotta think

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:27.210
about them, both inside the legislature

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.480
and outside of the legislature.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.480
So if you're thinking
about how to actually get

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.650
a bill enacted in Congress,
you have to not only

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:41.070
think about, you know,
who is gonna buy off who?

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:44.290
What deals are gonna be
made to get this bill

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.720
to parliament or through Congress?

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.350
You're gonna have to think about

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:54.080
building support out there
in the country for it.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.970
Because there are many, many things that

00:33:56.970 --> 00:34:01.481
politicians are planning to consider but

00:34:01.481 --> 00:34:05.300
in the American case,
for example, the rule

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.810
of thumb is if you're bill does not

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:11.420
get into the top eight,
which means it will

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:16.340
be known as HR1-2-3-4-5-6-7 or eight,

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:20.842
it's not going to actually
make it to the floor.

00:34:20.842 --> 00:34:22.120
It's not going to be voted on.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.520
How do you get a bill up there?

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.030
We saw, again, with the bill to repeal

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:32.910
the estate tax that it
took building support

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:34.970
outside of the beltway.

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:38.130
Not just inside of the beltway, to get

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:40.990
many politicians to become cosponsors

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:43.970
of that bill and see
it is in their interest

00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:45.220
to support it.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.444
So you have to think
about coalitions inside

00:34:47.444 --> 00:34:50.950
the legislature and
outside the legislature.

00:34:50.950 --> 00:34:55.218
If you think about the
abolition of the slave trade.

00:34:55.218 --> 00:35:00.218
Again, people like this
begins in, it's a story

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:05.200
that begins in Britain, people
like William Wilberforce

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:08.560
build a coalition in
the British parliament

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.920
of so called Dissenting
Whigs, the Dissenters.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.240
And just by chance, this is when,

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.850
this is before the hay
day of strong parties

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:17.683
in Britain.

00:35:17.683 --> 00:35:19.870
They still had multi-member districts

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.680
so they had much weaker parties.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.480
And it so happened that,
it behaved much more

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.900
like a European system and it so happened

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.870
that the Dissenting Whigs, for about five

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:36.110
consecutive elections, in
the mid, between the mid

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:41.110
1830s and the 1860s, the Whigs held

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:45.650
the balance of power and were
able, since the Dissenters

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.550
held the balance of power
and because they cared

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.440
more about that than anything else,

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.040
they made a condition of
supporting governments.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.160
Even Whig governments.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:58.610
Even governments that
supported other things

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:00.263
that they wanted.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.272
They cared so much about this,

00:36:03.272 --> 00:36:07.730
that they were able to put
it through the legislature.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:10.370
But they also built support for outside

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:11.563
the legislature.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.167
They threw various anti-slavery societies.

00:36:18.270 --> 00:36:22.076
And indeed, after William
Wilberforce left parliament,

00:36:22.076 --> 00:36:23.210
he spent the rest of his life

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.030
pressing the course
outside of the legislature.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.720
So, you really have to think about

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:32.260
building support inside the
legislature and outside.

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.300
A second thing you have to do is not only

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.990
think about enabling
coalitions, but you have

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.920
to think about the blocking coalitions.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.252
If you're gonna try and enact a policy,

00:36:43.252 --> 00:36:45.760
who's gonna try and stop it?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.820
And what are they gonna do?

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.260
Because, you know, your coalition

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.271
is not gonna prevail if this ineffective

00:36:52.271 --> 00:36:54.360
blocking coalition.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:59.133
Again, we saw, in the
repeal of the estate tax,

00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:02.410
very clever use of enabling conditions,

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.530
and very good strategic anticipation

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:09.730
of how to head off potential
blocking coalitions.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:14.214
And so we saw, for example, they got

00:37:14.214 --> 00:37:18.560
the congressional black caucus to support

00:37:19.650 --> 00:37:22.530
repeal of the estate tax on the grounds

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.600
that it would protect small business

00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.920
and particularly in African-American

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.570
communities, and they got
people like Bob Johnson

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:32.660
to support it.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.970
Black Entertainment Television

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:39.078
on the grounds that the first generations

00:37:39.078 --> 00:37:41.950
of wealthy African-Americans

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:48.377
shouldn't have their, save their

00:37:48.377 --> 00:37:51.820
accumulations tax away.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.970
They got the support of gay groups

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.640
on the grounds that estate tax

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:59.500
discriminates against gay people.

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.410
At that time, there was no provision

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:02.600
for gay marriage.

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.430
Of course, it was not the estate tax

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:05.977
that discriminated against gay people,

00:38:05.977 --> 00:38:09.180
it was the law of marriage
that discriminated

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.260
against gay people, but it didn't matter.

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.566
They got Frank Blethen, a liberal owner

00:38:14.566 --> 00:38:18.450
of the Seattle Times, to get family owned

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:21.370
newspapers to support it, because they

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:25.450
were worried about the Gannett and other

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.800
big multi-national news organizations

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.633
gobbling them up.

00:38:33.652 --> 00:38:36.260
They got the pharmacists to support it

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.470
so that they could get
it through the senate.

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.480
they got small business to support it

00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:42.550
so they could get it through the house.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.850
Very clever use of all of these groups.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.470
And then when they thought the potential

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:52.240
blocking coalitions, the life insurance

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.325
industry, estate planning, life insurance,

00:38:56.325 --> 00:39:01.020
the non-profits benefit
from the tax deductions

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:05.430
that people make in order
to protect themselves

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:08.010
from estate taxes.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:12.520
And they thought about
unions who generally fight.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:16.010
And they came up with
a separate strategy for

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:21.010
managing every one of
these potential blockers.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.550
And so, they managed to thread the needle

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:25.713
in that way.

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:31.300
If you think about, if you think about

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.120
the abolition of the slave trade.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.980
They very cleverly, in order to head off

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.960
potential blocking coalition, avoided

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.450
the question of slavery itself,

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.870
and began first with the abolition

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.740
of the slave trade in the North Atlantic.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.710
And so here, if you think about

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.880
the different coalitional possibilities,

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.760
they change greatly.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.900
Because if you're talking about

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.240
abolishing the slave trade,

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.785
it did not prevent the
cotton manufacturers

00:40:06.785 --> 00:40:10.870
in Manchester from getting cheap cotton

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:14.320
that came from the American South.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.655
It did not prevent the
Americans supporting

00:40:18.655 --> 00:40:21.940
after 1808 when it was possible

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.740
to abolish the slave trade.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.180
In fact, part of the reason you couldn't

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.440
have enforced the abolition
of the slave trade

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.310
without the Americans, and the reasons

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.900
the Americans supported it are not

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.193
very morally appealing.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.330
There was a racist sense that they

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.660
didn't want a great increase

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:50.660
in the African-American
population of the US

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.020
And in the American South, it was

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.800
essentially protection.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.957
There was a domestic slave trade

00:40:57.957 --> 00:41:01.680
that they were interested
in protecting at the time.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:06.680
So, it was possible to
put together a coalition

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.490
of strange bedfellows, if you like,

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:13.460
to get rid of the North
Atlantic slave trade.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:17.710
And they left the
battling of slavery itself

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:19.393
to another day.

00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:21.453
So, again.

00:41:21.453 --> 00:41:23.170
It was possible to put together

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.680
the coalition and head off potential

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.370
blocking coalitions by thinking

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:31.863
in those kinds of strategic ways.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.780
A third feature of thinking

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:39.211
about coalitions is that, hugely important

00:41:39.211 --> 00:41:43.430
to pay attention to business interests.

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:45.208
This has always been important.

00:41:45.208 --> 00:41:47.750
When we talked about, we talked

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.870
about the new deal.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:52.380
While it is true, and I even showed you

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.730
the I welcome the hatred video

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:58.698
on the second new deal that Roosevelt

00:41:58.698 --> 00:42:02.720
ran on when he was running for reelection.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.270
As my colleague, Peter Swenson and others

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:08.190
have documented that most significant

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.350
expansions in welfare states

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.500
have come about with at least tacit

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.220
and sometimes active support
from business interests.

00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:19.963
And if you think that was true then,

00:42:19.963 --> 00:42:22.570
in the world we're living in today

00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:26.310
that I described to you over the lectures

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:28.660
in this course, when business interests

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.981
are in a position of unparalleled

00:42:31.981 --> 00:42:36.074
power politically, if you're going to try

00:42:36.074 --> 00:42:41.074
to enact policies that affect business

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.910
interests, you better think about

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.083
how they're going to respond.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:49.640
Now, that doesn't mean
you should necessarily

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.840
kowtow to business interests.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.701
But you need to think about,

00:42:53.701 --> 00:42:56.910
will they be an enabling coalition?

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:59.140
Will they be a blocking coalition?

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:02.952
Is it possible to divide
business interests

00:43:02.952 --> 00:43:06.290
so that some business
interests are working

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:10.240
across purposes with
other business interests?

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.908
But in this point of the 21st century,

00:43:13.908 --> 00:43:18.162
the idea that in any capitalist democracy,

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:23.162
anybody is going to enact policies that

00:43:24.454 --> 00:43:28.950
affect business interests in a serious way

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:32.820
without contending with business interests

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.430
is a fantasy.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:36.780
It's not going to be possible.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:39.260
And so you have to think about

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:42.190
how business interests are going to be

00:43:43.212 --> 00:43:45.360
a factor in whatever it is

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:49.603
that you're trying to do
or trying to forestall.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.790
So, for all of these reasons,

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:56.978
some analytical, some empirical, you have

00:43:56.978 --> 00:43:59.740
to think about coalitions.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.923
The median voter is not gonna be enough.

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:09.030
Secondly, moral narratives.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:13.360
As I said, when we talked
about occupy Wall street,

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.213
moral narratives matter in politics.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.093
Why do they matter?

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:23.570
One reason is implicit in what

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.030
we've already talked about.

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.750
The very fact that purely interest-based

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:31.230
coalitions are inherently unstable.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:32.690
We know that from the majority rule

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:35.050
divided all again means that something

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:37.771
else has gotta hold them together.

00:44:37.771 --> 00:44:41.153
If all you're gonna do is say...

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:49.330
We'll make a deal where you get

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.060
the biggest possible slice, somebody else

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:55.380
will come along and
offer you a bigger slice.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.990
And so, you have to think about,

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:02.410
well, what is it that will get people

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:05.700
to resist when that somebody comes along

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.163
and tries to recruit you
to a blocking coalition?

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.450
The story I told you when we did

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:18.910
the estate tax class was that when

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.470
the democrats finally figured out

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:21.940
what was going on, they came and

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.620
tried to hive off the farmers.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.610
They're said, we'll give an immediate,

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:26.443
remember this?

00:45:26.443 --> 00:45:29.680
We'll give an immediate
exemption to farmers.

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.085
And they had a huge fight during

00:45:32.085 --> 00:45:36.522
the subsequent meetings
of the repeal coalition

00:45:36.522 --> 00:45:39.270
because the farmers were
actually being offered

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.083
a better deal by the democrats,
the permanent repeal,

00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.470
than the bill was gonna give them,

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:50.533
which was gonna be this
weird 10 year repeal.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.720
But they said things when
you interviewed them.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.150
They sounded like abortion activists.

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.930
They said, how could I
look myself in the mirror?

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.170
How could I tell my child that I had

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.100
been bought off?

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:07.133
This is a moral crusade, it's
an unjust tax, and so on.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:12.433
If you want another
example, many years ago

00:46:12.433 --> 00:46:16.338
I had a call from an academic colleague,

00:46:16.338 --> 00:46:20.710
a philosopher who said they were starting

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:24.043
a new party, it was gonna
be called the New Party.

00:46:24.043 --> 00:46:26.130
(students laughing)

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.183
And would I support it?

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:31.990
And I said, well, okay,
what is the New Party

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.823
all about?

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:37.258
And they said, we want
it to be an equivalent

00:46:37.258 --> 00:46:39.950
counterbalance on the left to what

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:43.481
the moral majority is on the right.

00:46:43.481 --> 00:46:46.433
This is the era of the moral majority.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:51.240
Which, moral majority
is sort of predecessor,

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.557
if you like, to the tea party.

00:46:53.557 --> 00:46:56.860
And I said, well, good luck, goodbye,

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.120
I hope you do well with it.

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.650
And of course, there's a reason

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.805
why nobody here has
heard of the New Party.

00:47:03.805 --> 00:47:07.370
because being a
counterbalance to the moral

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:11.650
majority is not a
compelling moral narrative.

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:15.270
The people in the moral
majority believe in something.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:17.090
That's why they're there.

00:47:17.090 --> 00:47:20.130
They're willing to internalize costs.

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.410
They're willing to stay up.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.082
They're willing to go to meetings.

00:47:23.082 --> 00:47:24.540
They're willing to do something because

00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:26.350
they believe in the cause.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.183
Right?

00:47:27.183 --> 00:47:30.103
And so, the idea that you can have,

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.910
that you can have people join a coalition

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:37.860
who don't actually believe in the cause

00:47:39.657 --> 00:47:42.423
isn't gonna be enough when people

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:47.589
come along trying to split your coalition.

00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:52.589
When George W Bush in
2005 sought to privatize

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.660
social security, I'll have more to say

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:57.700
about that in a little while,

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.530
but one of the things he ran into was,

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.940
he couldn't split the coalition.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.710
They tried by saying the new system

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:08.681
will not apply to people...

00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:11.740
I think they tried 55, and then they

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:15.270
tried 50, under the age of
55, under the age of 50.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:19.090
And they found that public opinion among

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.530
the elderly didn't move a millimeter.

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:23.953
So, what did this reflect?

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:28.970
It reflected the fact that elderly

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:32.190
people didn't just care
about social security

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:33.970
for themselves, but for their children

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:34.960
and grandchildren.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.689
And so they weren't
sufficiently self-interested

00:48:37.689 --> 00:48:40.349
to be peeled off in that way.

00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:42.490
They were committed to the idea

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:44.660
that this was gonna be
important to be there

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.760
for future generations.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.620
Again, they couldn't be bought off just

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.950
on the basis of their self-interest.

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:56.730
So, an effective movement
is almost certainly

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:01.090
going to require moral narratives

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.290
that cause people to resist being

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:07.520
picked off by some blocking coalition.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.903
And gonna motivate them to do the work.

00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:14.840
To show up at meetings,
to do the leafletting,

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:19.040
to do the donkey work of moving

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.290
a movement forward.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.450
Notice it need not be
the same moral narrative

00:49:24.450 --> 00:49:25.780
for everybody.

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.000
If you look again, go back to the case

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.750
of the abolition of the slave trade.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:32.510
I keep coming back to the slave trade,

00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.470
it's a very interesting example

00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:37.440
because an economist, if there had been

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.920
neoclassical economists around

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.770
at the beginning of the 19th century,

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:45.364
they would have said it'd be impossible

00:49:45.364 --> 00:49:46.197
to abolish the slave trade.

00:49:46.197 --> 00:49:48.657
The race to the bottom,
all the usual reasons

00:49:48.657 --> 00:49:50.090
would have been given.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.860
So, I think it's a great
example of realistic

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:57.073
utopianism, that it actually got done.

00:49:58.224 --> 00:50:01.010
But if you look at the moral narratives,

00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:04.060
actually people didn't share the same

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:05.630
moral narratives.

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:08.920
If you look at, for some it was

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.460
religious moral narrative.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:14.560
For people like David
Hume, it was a different

00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:15.820
moral narrative.

00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:18.900
There were moral narratives related

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:21.390
to driving down wages...

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:25.940
In some countries.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:27.320
So, it doesn't necessarily have

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.260
to be the same moral narrative.

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.350
But it has to be a moral
narrative that will

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.290
motivate people and prevent them

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:37.273
from being picked off.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:44.240
So, a third feature of effective

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.760
distributive politics, and
this is hugely important.

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.430
In some ways, very difficult
sometimes in practice

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:53.530
to think about.

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:56.963
And this is to pursue proximate goals.

00:50:58.590 --> 00:51:02.228
So, one way of thinking a proximate goal

00:51:02.228 --> 00:51:06.140
is, it's a waystation to a better future

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:10.770
that will start you on a road to somewhere

00:51:10.770 --> 00:51:13.993
where you're gonna end
up later at a better one.

00:51:14.837 --> 00:51:16.480
So, getting rid of the slave trade

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.580
is a proximate goal on the way

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.420
to getting rid of slavery.

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.440
Of course, it didn't help in the US

00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.300
they had a civil war about it.

00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.500
But it did help in the British Empire,

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.150
they abolished slavery in almost

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.260
the whole of the empire by 1833,

00:51:32.526 --> 00:51:35.650
including by paying 20 million pounds

00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:38.440
in compensation in various
parts of the empire.

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.740
And then they spent the next six decades

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:46.740
stamping it out,
including getting involved

00:51:46.784 --> 00:51:49.980
in an undeclared war in South America.

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.575
But pursue proximate goals, move,

00:51:53.575 --> 00:51:57.430
to use an American analogy,

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.530
move the ball down the field

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.610
rather than simply trying to throw

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:05.123
hail Mary passes every time.

00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:07.553
So, why is this important?

00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:11.560
One is that it's important for sustaining

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.770
coalitions and motivating support.

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:15.640
So...

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:21.530
If you have a proximate
goal, that's something

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.200
you can organize your coalition around.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:27.580
You can motivate people to fight for

00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.080
and to achieve.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:32.777
So, if you think about, say, again,

00:52:32.777 --> 00:52:35.680
repeal of a particular tax.

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.050
We've gotta repeal the
tax, you know, we...

00:52:42.433 --> 00:52:44.300
We build the coalition,
we have the meetings,

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:45.520
we push the bill.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:46.890
And then you finally achieve it,

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:48.340
you can say, we did it.

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:51.293
You can get people to focus on,

00:52:52.779 --> 00:52:55.290
that can motivate them, and it gets

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:57.560
them to focus on the result.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.660
Or if you think about
the civil rights act,

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.593
which we spent some time on.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.190
The features of the civil rights act

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:10.545
that were most effectively adopted

00:53:10.545 --> 00:53:13.990
involved well defined proximate goals.

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.760
Like getting rid of restrictive covenants.

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.830
The more nebulous goals,

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:23.080
such as reducing racial inequality,

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:26.560
or integrating neighborhoods

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.193
much harder to achieve.

00:53:29.193 --> 00:53:33.764
So, proximate goals are important

00:53:33.764 --> 00:53:38.764
for moving, you know, moving things along

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:42.140
in the direction that you want to go.

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:45.230
And for making sure that the best does not

00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:48.493
become the enemy of the good.

00:53:50.261 --> 00:53:53.700
A couple of weeks ago,
we had Gidon Bromberg

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:56.535
from EchoPeace here to give the

00:53:56.535 --> 00:54:00.370
part of the lecture that
I had not had time to give

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:02.220
when I talked about when we did the

00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:04.480
Israel-Palestine case.

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:07.930
And I think I saw some
of you in his lecture.

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:12.851
Which is on a fascinating topic of using

00:54:12.851 --> 00:54:17.851
economic interdependencies around climate

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:21.720
to work to move the Israel-Palestine

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:25.810
conflict in the direction of a resolution.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:29.927
And in particular, the
fact that the Jordan

00:54:29.927 --> 00:54:34.680
River is drying up, and the two million

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.530
people in Gaza lack sufficient energy

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:41.118
to process their own sewage.

00:54:41.118 --> 00:54:44.610
Partly because it's
being denied by Israel,

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:48.470
the energy, but partly just
an overwhelming demographic

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:51.799
pressure has started causing a situation

00:54:51.799 --> 00:54:55.000
weighing increases amounts of sewage

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.860
from Gaza being pumped
into the Mediterranean,

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:01.750
drifting up an forcing desalination

00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:04.443
plants in Israel to shut down.

00:55:05.590 --> 00:55:10.590
It turns out that Jordan has the best

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:15.810
available geographical situation

00:55:15.810 --> 00:55:19.080
and technology at the
moment for solar energy.

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:22.353
And so EchoPeace has come up with

00:55:22.353 --> 00:55:27.353
an ingenious plan prepared by solar energy

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:31.840
that can produce power that will power

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:35.680
the sewage plants in Gaza,

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.970
which will in turn save Israel money.

00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:41.160
And they've lined the whole thing up

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.240
so that the incentives work for everyone.

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:47.190
And all of the governments know this.

00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:51.740
And they've even created,
they've raised capital for it.

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:55.050
So, there's private sector
interest in doing this.

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:58.670
And in several rounds
of peace negotiations,

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:02.755
solving this water problem in this way,

00:56:02.755 --> 00:56:04.610
which would actually integrate

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:07.100
the Palestinian, Israelian, Jordanian

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.060
economies much more and produce

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.840
co-dependencies has come up.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.050
but it's treated as one of
the final status issues.

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:18.620
And so the final status issues are these

00:56:18.620 --> 00:56:22.283
difficult questions to be resolved later.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:25.540
Something that was never allowed to derail

00:56:25.540 --> 00:56:28.070
the South African negotiations.

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:32.380
And so Gidon made the case that it would

00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.370
be much better to solve
the water issue now.

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:38.880
And he pointed out that every Middle East

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.670
negotiator that had
tried to get a settlement

00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:46.810
from Clinton to carry,
and others in between,

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:49.700
subsequently had said,
we should have dealt

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.660
with the water issue.

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:55.540
So, this is an example, again, that we've

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.800
videotaped that lecture.

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:59.233
But I strongly urge you to go and see it.

00:57:00.569 --> 00:57:04.221
An example where it would be much better

00:57:04.221 --> 00:57:08.307
not to let the best be
the enemy of the good,

00:57:08.307 --> 00:57:13.307
but use the water issue and resolution

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:16.850
of the water issue to
take it off the table

00:57:16.850 --> 00:57:20.940
and move the three
countries into a situation

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.930
where they would be
more likely to cooperate

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:27.283
on other matters in the future.

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:30.260
But they're hard cases.

00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:33.860
They're really difficult
cases in thinking about

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.500
proximate goals.

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:39.730
And the hard cases are where if you pursue

00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:43.850
a proximate goal, it might make it,

00:57:43.850 --> 00:57:47.200
instead of being a
waystation to the future,

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.390
it might actually make the future more

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:52.150
difficult to achieve.

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:57.150
So, think about Medicare
and social security.

00:57:57.870 --> 00:58:01.310
Social security, we discussed earlier,

00:58:01.310 --> 00:58:05.190
was put in place in 1935, and in order

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.397
to get it through congress, FDR

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.250
had to exclude the Mexican

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:15.190
agricultural workers, because

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:17.820
not to do so would have broken

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:20.010
up his coalition of Southern democrats

00:58:20.010 --> 00:58:22.030
who controlled the committees.

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:24.870
And so, that was done later.

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:27.880
It was expanded to cover
those workers later.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.210
That's, you know, it's not, it wasn't

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:32.380
great for the people at the time,

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.470
but you could say, well, you know,

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:39.173
you take what you can get,
and you expand it later.

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:45.340
Medicare's a harder
case, because Medicare,

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:49.100
put in place in 1965,
part of the great society

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:52.350
by Lindon Johnson creates a world

00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:55.640
we live in today where it's much more

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.550
difficult to create universal healthcare

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:02.587
because the one group that you would want

00:59:02.587 --> 00:59:06.460
in your coalition has
no reason to be there.

00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.590
Namely the elderly.

00:59:07.590 --> 00:59:11.990
The elderly, they vote,
they're politically

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:16.990
active, but they already
have universal healthcare.

00:59:17.172 --> 00:59:21.584
And indeed, if you were
gonna go to any of the

00:59:21.584 --> 00:59:24.510
current plans being proposed,

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:25.810
which are being underpriced

00:59:25.810 --> 00:59:27.680
from Medicare for all, there would

00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.340
be a reasonable fear that Medicare

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:32.295
benefits were going to be diluted

00:59:32.295 --> 00:59:35.500
for the people who already have them.

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.860
So, that becomes a much harder judgment.

00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:40.210
It doesn't mean that they shouldn't have

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.870
gone for Medicare for 65 year olds

00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:45.680
in 1965, it's just a harder call.

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.750
It's a harder case, right?

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:51.410
Because you're creating a potential

00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:53.470
to split the coalition that you're gonna

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:55.450
need to expand it later.

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:58.240
because Medicare funding is seen

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:03.240
as more of a zero sum system of funding

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:06.930
than the way social security is funded

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:09.880
about which I will say more in a minute.

01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.960
Sometimes it should be said that

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.803
this is shooting in the dark.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.460
When Bush passed his 2001 tax cut

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:24.460
that included the estate tax repeal,

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.870
it was done through budget reconciliation.

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:30.970
And it was gonna go away 10 years later.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:34.421
Actually, nobody had any
idea what that would mean.

01:00:34.421 --> 01:00:37.550
And you couldn't use the
inertia of the system,

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.850
because the inertia was
gonna have it go away.

01:00:39.850 --> 01:00:41.750
It was gonna be repealed back

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:45.274
to the 2001 law if nothing was done.

01:00:45.274 --> 01:00:47.760
So, they were just gambling.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:51.440
And as it turned out,
the Obama Administration

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:54.178
made almost all of it permanent as we saw.

01:00:54.178 --> 01:00:57.270
So, proximate goals, really important,

01:00:57.270 --> 01:01:01.000
but you need to always
recognize that pursuing

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.993
a proximate goal may not
be good in the long run.

01:01:07.070 --> 01:01:09.975
And so, in that sense, as I said,

01:01:09.975 --> 01:01:13.170
I think it'd be hard to make the case

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:16.160
that if it was Medicare for 65 year olds

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.060
or nothing, it would have been better

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.310
to have taken nothing, but it's a hard

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.153
political call.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.220
Entrenching gains.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:29.560
Very important to entrench
gains for the long run,

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.966
because otherwise, they can be undone.

01:01:32.966 --> 01:01:36.030
The classic example of this, of course,

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:37.213
is reconstruction.

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.390
The gains that were brought about

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:41.930
as a result of the civil war,

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:44.150
yes we got the abolition of slavery,

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:49.150
but then we got the 14th
and 15th amendments,

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.646
and the extension of the franchise,

01:01:52.646 --> 01:01:55.188
all of which was later undone,

01:01:55.188 --> 01:01:59.856
because the North was not sufficiently

01:01:59.856 --> 01:02:04.343
committed to entrenching those changers.

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:08.200
If you want an example
of what I'm calling here,

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.560
the gold standard of entrenchment,

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.760
it's the way that social
security was funded.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:18.698
So, what FDR did was quite ingenious.

01:02:18.698 --> 01:02:21.267
They put in the system where,

01:02:21.267 --> 01:02:23.450
you know, it's a savings plan.

01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:25.340
The idea is, you work for your lifetime,

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.770
you pay in, and then when you retire,

01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:29.610
you get it out.

01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:32.240
But, that's not the way it's financed.

01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.630
It's not the way it's financed

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:37.330
because they wanted to start
paying out immediately.

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:39.010
And of course, the first generation

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:41.340
of workers in 1935 hadn't paid in.

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.550
It started paying out in 1937.

01:02:43.550 --> 01:02:45.540
Those people had not paid in.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.290
And so, in reality, the current generation

01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:53.170
of workers funds the current
generation of retirees.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.010
And when people say there's an IOU

01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:56.850
in the social security trust fund,

01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:58.710
that's what they mean.

01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:59.543
Right?

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.830
Now, FDR did that for two reasons.

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:03.960
One was to build the coalition.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.060
He wanted everybody to
support it at the time.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:10.720
So, he wanted existing workers who hadn't

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:11.850
paid in to support it.

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:14.470
Of course, if you're gonna get it,

01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:17.707
you know, people about to
retire are gonna get it,

01:03:17.707 --> 01:03:18.960
they're gonna support the coalition.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.385
But he also wanted to make it impossible

01:03:21.385 --> 01:03:23.677
or very difficult to undo.

01:03:23.677 --> 01:03:24.624
Right?

01:03:24.624 --> 01:03:26.408
He said, I'm gonna fund this, he said,

01:03:26.408 --> 01:03:28.250
I'm gonna set this up in a way

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:31.290
so that no damn fool politician

01:03:31.290 --> 01:03:33.020
can ever undo it.

01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:36.470
And so, in 2005 when George W Bush

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:39.254
tried to undo it, he ran into

01:03:39.254 --> 01:03:41.780
the reality that, you
know, what they wanted

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:44.530
to do was create private accounts,

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.000
but instead of the money
going to the government,

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.190
this was two years before
the financial crisis.

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:51.364
It would have been pretty ugly politics

01:03:51.364 --> 01:03:53.780
if they'd gotten away with it,

01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.069
but instead of the money going into

01:03:57.069 --> 01:04:00.160
social security, it would be just like

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.390
an IRA or like we all have.

01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:08.280
It would be going to an
account that you wouldn't

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.283
privately manage account.

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:14.140
But the problem was, to do this,

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:16.120
they would have had to fund both systems

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.130
for an entire cohort.

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:19.040
Right?

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.290
Because there's no
money in the trust fund.

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:23.450
Right?

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:25.940
And so, this in effect is what

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:28.900
made the financing of social security,

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:33.410
apart from its popularity,
made it bulletproof.

01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:37.160
So, very clever system of entrenching

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.370
the program in a way that would make

01:04:39.370 --> 01:04:41.030
it extremely costly.

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:43.500
And as it turned out, eventually the Bush

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.648
people gave up.

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:49.120
But the most important thing, and this

01:04:51.290 --> 01:04:53.280
should be evident to you from my earlier

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:56.280
lecture on bundling is that the way

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:01.280
in which you build protection for a policy

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.350
is to build support for it,

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:07.140
and get one of the major parties to bundle

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.360
it into their major party platform.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.550
So, what protected the Civil Rights Act

01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:14.717
is it's bundled into
the democratic platform.

01:05:14.717 --> 01:05:18.140
What failed to protect reconstruction is,

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:21.250
it was not bundled into the things

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:24.143
that Northern republicans cared about.

01:05:25.079 --> 01:05:27.920
And of course, if you can get it bundled

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:30.530
into the platforms of both parties,

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:33.830
such as social security effectively is,

01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:36.118
even better.

01:05:36.118 --> 01:05:40.770
So, entrench proximate
gains for the long-term.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:42.660
Resources matter.

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:46.503
Resources matter in two senses.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:50.473
Resources for funding the effort.

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.100
If you look at something
like the estate tax

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.770
repeal coalition, wealthy...

01:06:02.023 --> 01:06:05.150
Wealthy individuals put up money

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:08.730
to fund the organizing
effort, to get that done.

01:06:08.730 --> 01:06:13.460
And we give chapter and
verse of that in our book.

01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:14.680
They paid for the meetings,

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:19.680
they paid for the resources
to lobby, and so on.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.690
And indeed, the whole rise of

01:06:23.690 --> 01:06:26.120
neoliberalism was funded

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:29.500
not through campaign contributions,

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:33.870
but spending on think
tanks and other areas.

01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:35.960
So, funding efforts.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:37.483
And then funding the policy.

01:06:38.730 --> 01:06:41.470
So, what was so brilliant
about social security

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:45.950
was, it was immediately
funded by existing workers.

01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:47.950
So, again, you have to think about

01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:50.400
the resources, whereas again,

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:55.400
go back to Occupy Wall
Street that we began with.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:07:00.510
One of the reasons the
mayors of most cities

01:07:00.590 --> 01:07:02.920
just ignored them was that they knew

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.460
Winter would come, they
would have no money,

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.840
they would have no resources,

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.110
and they would pack up and go back

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.860
to wherever they came from.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:16.403
So, again, they hadn't any resources.

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:21.300
And then finally, leadership matters.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:24.690
Leadership matters partly
because all coalitions

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:25.523
are unstable.

01:07:25.523 --> 01:07:28.020
You need people to articulate.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.700
You need people to articulate
the moral narratives

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:34.729
to do the work to keep people together.

01:07:34.729 --> 01:07:38.440
Again, if you think about
the Civil Rights Act.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.030
The Kennedy people, they sent civil rights

01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:47.030
legislation to capital hill in 1963.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.070
They had almost no
experience with Congress,

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:54.010
and it soon got bottled
up in the committees.

01:07:54.010 --> 01:07:57.530
And it wasn't until Lyndon Johnson

01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:59.610
who had been the master of the Senate,

01:07:59.610 --> 01:08:02.130
this is all told chapter and verse

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:06.360
and volume four of Caro's four volume

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.400
work on Lyndon Johnson.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.885
But Johnson understood,
he's widely recognized

01:08:12.885 --> 01:08:16.265
as one of the most effective legislative

01:08:16.265 --> 01:08:20.330
politicians of the 20th century.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:23.610
And it was he who figured out how to do

01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:28.493
the leadership on the
hill to get that enacted.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.227
So, you need leadership
in the legislature,

01:08:32.227 --> 01:08:34.628
you need grass roots leadership.

01:08:34.628 --> 01:08:38.790
You need to mobilize support for policies,

01:08:38.790 --> 01:08:42.720
or they're they not going to get enacted.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.730
And of course, you need what's sometimes

01:08:44.730 --> 01:08:46.730
referred to by consultants

01:08:46.730 --> 01:08:49.630
as grass tops leadership.

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:51.540
You need those Frank Blethens,

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:55.260
and you need those Bob Johnsons to

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:01.600
push for support if you like to articulate

01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:05.140
to act as kind of brokers

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:08.906
between grass roots support and support

01:09:08.906 --> 01:09:12.510
in the legislature.

01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:16.960
But just to finish, effective
politics is not enough.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.900
Those six elements are not enough.

01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:22.650
If you go back through,
the story I told you

01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.708
about home ownership.

01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:28.040
There was a great coalition to do it

01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.880
that included politicians
from both parties,

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.020
it included the lobbyists
from Fannie and Freddie,

01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:35.590
it included people who were going

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:38.090
to make money out of securitization.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:40.430
They had not one, but
two moral narratives.

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:43.430
The American dream of home ownership

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:46.700
on the one hand, and then racial inclusion

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.533
on the other.

01:09:47.533 --> 01:09:49.690
So, they had two moral narratives.

01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:51.370
They had great proximate goals.

01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:54.620
They could articulate how many

01:09:54.620 --> 01:09:57.860
more homes should be owned
by minority homeowners

01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:59.300
by benchmark dates.

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.670
They had proximate goal
after proximate goal.

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:04.365
They entrenched the gains indeed.

01:10:04.365 --> 01:10:06.960
One of the tragedies of it was that it

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.260
was impossible to unwind when it would

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:12.150
have been in the interests of the minority

01:10:12.150 --> 01:10:14.595
homeowners to unwind it in the ways

01:10:14.595 --> 01:10:17.400
that Geanokopolis was proposing.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:21.100
So, it became a kind of
pathologically entrenched.

01:10:22.257 --> 01:10:25.240
The resources were brilliantly generated

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.772
by the securitization, which created

01:10:27.772 --> 01:10:30.510
a study cycle of liquidity

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:34.430
to produce more of the activity

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.880
until the music stopped,
to use Blinder's line.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.270
And then there was leadership.

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:44.570
There was leadership from
both political parties.

01:10:44.570 --> 01:10:47.020
There was leadership in the country.

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:51.310
And there was plenty of
support from business

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:54.980
leaders who saw that there
was money to be made.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.507
So, building blocks of effective

01:10:57.507 --> 01:11:00.430
distributive politics are important,

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:03.180
but they're not a
substitute for good policy,

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:06.980
and you can indeed have
bad policy that meets

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:10.810
all six of these criteria.

01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:13.710
And that would be the
poster child for that.

01:11:13.710 --> 01:11:16.430
So, next we're gonna look at good policies

01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:18.130
that can be enacted by paying

01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:20.793
attention to these six building blocks.

01:11:21.899 --> 01:11:24.933
And that's what we'll
start with on Thursday.

01:11:27.632 --> 01:11:30.549
(soft tonal music)

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.820
- So today we're going to talk
about two what I'm calling

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.940
tough nuts, education and healthcare,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.950
but I want to just begin by
taking stock of where we were

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.660
before we went on the break.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.290
- Right now, the human worker does $50,000

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.180
worth of work in a factory.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.190
That income is taxed.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.333
If the robot comes in
to do the same thing,

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:38.333
you'd think that we'd tax
the robot at a similar level.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:41.772
(energetic music)

00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:49.420
What the world wants is
to take this opportunity

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.775
to make all the goods and
services we have today

00:00:51.775 --> 00:00:53.726
and free up labor.

00:00:53.726 --> 00:00:58.630
Let us do a better job of
reaching out to the elderly,

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.700
having smaller class size,
helping kids with special needs.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.647
All of those things where
human empathy and understanding

00:01:05.647 --> 00:01:10.040
are still very, very unique
and we still deal with

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.040
an immense shortage of
people to help out there.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.820
And so, if you can take the
labor that used to do the thing

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.430
automation replaces, and both
financially and training-wise

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.310
and fulfillment-wise,
have that person go off

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.675
and do these other
things, you're net ahead.

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:35.064
But you can't just give
up that income tax,

00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:37.631
because that's part of
how you've been funding

00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:41.180
that level of human workers.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.370
Some of it can come on the
profits that are generated

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.650
by the labor saving efficiency there.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.150
Some of it can come directly
in some type of robot tax.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.810
You know, I don't think
the robot companies

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.893
are going to be outraged
that there might be a tax.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.793
It's okay.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.540
- So, that was a fairly agreeable
version of a tax proposal,

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.883
which I'll come back to later.

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:18.070
But this is part five of the course,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.740
focused on what is to be done,
and the bumper sticker that,

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.258
with apologies to Immanuel
Kant, was that politics without,

00:02:26.258 --> 00:02:28.750
policy without politics is empty,

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.592
but politics without policy is blind.

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:36.960
And when we talked about
policy without viable politics,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.960
I gave as examples Piketty's
proposal for global wealth tax

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.264
with no identified enforcement mechanisms

00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:51.264
and his more recent proposals
for a European Parliament

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.860
that would engage in
redistributive politics

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.528
and have trumping power over the existing

00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:01.930
European structures,
even though the attempt

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.216
to create such a parliament
had failed because of

00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:09.987
popular hostility to it,
and had instead resulted

00:03:09.987 --> 00:03:13.360
in the Lisbon Treaty.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.055
When we talked about politics
without viable policies,

00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:20.800
politics without viable policies,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.950
I gave us the bumper sticker for that,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.570
the subprime mortgage crisis,
where extremely politically

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.570
effective coalitions had been
put together across the aisle

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.007
and with lobbyists and industry advocates,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.360
not to mention the advocates
for housing for the poor,

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.360
but it produced a train wreck of a policy.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.640
We then focused on the
subject of insecurity,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.012
arguing that insecurity
is in many respects,

00:04:00.012 --> 00:04:03.210
more important than
inequality and certainly

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.030
than global inequalities for people,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.851
and made the case that
universal basic income,

00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:13.109
despite the apparent support for it across

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.420
various ideological groups,
that doesn't withstand scrutiny

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.820
when you see that the
conservative case for it would

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.443
largely result in the abolition
of what we think of as

00:04:27.443 --> 00:04:32.443
the welfare state, Social
Security, Medicare and so on,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.100
so they would easily be
blocking coalitions for that,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.950
and indeed when you look in
Europe at, where they've held

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.610
referendums on this,
such as in Switzerland,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.743
there's not much support for it.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.827
We talked some about minimum
wage and the difficulties

00:04:51.827 --> 00:04:56.120
of that, particularly
the race to the bottom

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.320
or the race out of the country problem

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.556
that accompanies minimum wage politics,

00:05:01.556 --> 00:05:06.556
and instead argued for an
expanded earned income tax credit,

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.100
which goes back to the
Nixon administration's

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.048
notion of a negative income
tax, and could become

00:05:13.048 --> 00:05:17.530
the basis for a more
effective wage subsidy,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.560
and has been greatly
expanded in recent decades

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.590
under Republican and
Democrat administrations.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.494
And there are also state-based
earned income tax credits,

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:31.271
which have the advantage
of creating a kind of

00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:35.840
race to the top incentive
in that they become magnets,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.905
states can make themselves
magnets for employment

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:43.270
because of the employment subsidy.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.310
Economists will still
complain that this distorts

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.830
labor markets, which it does,
but any policy that attempts

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.050
to affect employment at some
level is going to affect

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.900
labor markets, and we argue that

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.084
this is a better way to do it.

00:06:00.084 --> 00:06:04.620
We then went on to the idea of universal

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.390
adjustment assistance
and I worked through the

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.160
sort of tragic history of trade investment

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.680
and insurance adjustment assistance, where

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.770
labor had initially supported
it as a quid pro quo

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.520
for the 1962 Trade Act
which reduced tariffs,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.170
but then it was largely not implemented

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.456
by the Johnson administration
that came into office in 1963.

00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:33.670
Nothing was paid out.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.180
In fact, over the next decade
and by the time business

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.180
got around to supporting
it, labor had bailed out,

00:06:42.187 --> 00:06:46.390
and it had garnered a
lot of opposition because

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.390
by only supporting people who
lose their jobs from trade,

00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:54.910
this seemed arbitrary from from
the point of view of people

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.210
who lost their jobs for other reasons,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.410
and indeed when the Reagan
administration effectively

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.110
killed off the program they
made that same argument,

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.207
so it was made both on
the left and the right,

00:07:06.207 --> 00:07:10.394
and we argue, particularly
given the sort of dynamic

00:07:10.394 --> 00:07:13.700
that Bill Gates is referring
to, they have jobs going

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.700
in any case increasingly to
technology rather than to trade.

00:07:19.462 --> 00:07:24.462
There should be a Danish style,
much more universal system

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:29.950
of adjustment assistance
that would provide

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.240
for relocation, for
retraining across a lifetime.

00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:37.420
And when we think about how might that

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:41.873
sort of adjustment assistance
be funded, as Gates,

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.232
Gates perhaps is a little
naive to think corporations

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:50.430
will not abolish it, but in
fact this is in the interest

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.040
of business because one thing
that economists will say,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:00.040
but it's not obvious to lay
people, is that public education

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.090
of any sort is actually
a subsidy to business.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.221
It's a government subsidy
to business by creating

00:08:08.221 --> 00:08:12.660
trained workers that
businesses can then hire,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.300
and so government subsidies
of retraining programs, again,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.189
is at the end of the day,
a subsidy to business,

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:24.720
and we make the case in
in my forthcoming book

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.873
with Michael Glass that business leaders

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:30.250
should be getting behind proposed,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.660
doing what Gates is doing
there, getting behind

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:37.660
such proposals, because they
will sort of, if you like,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.470
Tocqueville's self interest
rightly understood,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.893
it really is in businesses'
interest to support the creation

00:08:45.893 --> 00:08:50.893
of a perpetually re-educatable
workforce that's going to be

00:08:51.655 --> 00:08:54.990
flexible in ways that
are going to be required

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:58.850
by the demands of the 21st century.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.208
So, today's agenda is to talk
about two other challenges:

00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:07.517
K through 12 education and
universal health insurance,

00:09:07.517 --> 00:09:11.924
and they're very vexed
subjects in America,

00:09:11.924 --> 00:09:15.220
and they're vexed subjects partly because

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.039
there are two other
features of the American

00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:23.039
political order, which make
it very extremely difficult

00:09:23.645 --> 00:09:28.645
to enact a lot of social
policies and these are worse here

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:32.320
or more challenging here
than in many other countries.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.430
The first is fiscal federalism.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:36.510
We've referred to this
earlier in the course,

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.950
you might recall, when I talked about the

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.530
deinstitutionalization
of psychiatric patients

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.218
in connection with
rising prison populations

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:50.176
and with the discovery of antidepressants

00:09:50.176 --> 00:09:55.176
and anti-psychotropic drugs
to repress things like

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.991
schizophrenia, when in the 1960s and 70s,

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:04.324
this led to many people who had previously

00:10:04.324 --> 00:10:09.324
lived their whole lives
in psychiatric hospitals

00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:13.600
to be released, but it
was also a time of great

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.860
fiscal crisis in many of the states,

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.727
and so those savings were
put to the bottom line

00:10:18.727 --> 00:10:22.150
of state budgets and instead
those people wound up

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.193
in American cities where there was not,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.809
there were no resources
for them, and consequently,

00:10:29.809 --> 00:10:32.910
many of them then wound up
back in the prison system.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.334
And so this is the kind
of the dark side of

00:10:36.334 --> 00:10:41.070
fiscal federalism that we
have a very decentralized

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.202
federal system, unlike say
the German federal system,

00:10:44.202 --> 00:10:46.960
where there are very clear demarcations,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.610
because the whole federal
system was designed at once,

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.210
of what's the risk, so
there are clear demarcations

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.530
of what is the responsibility
of which level of government,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.020
whereas we have a kind
of bottom up federalism

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:05.020
that was created
piecemeal, and power is not

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.630
explicitly delegated to
the federal government,

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.020
reside with the states,
some things are the province

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:14.610
of cities and not the
responsibilities of states,

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.750
and so it's very easy for things
to fall through the cracks

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.270
and we will see as we talk
about education and healthcare

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:26.620
that this decentralized
character of American federalism

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.620
makes it extremely
difficult to enact policies

00:11:31.783 --> 00:11:33.836
that in other countries would be done

00:11:33.836 --> 00:11:36.500
as a matter of national policy

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.730
or what we would call federal policy here.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.218
The other is that the
that the American system

00:11:43.218 --> 00:11:48.218
is much more subject to
what some social scientists

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.297
refer to as path dependence,
and the idea of path dependence

00:11:53.297 --> 00:11:57.690
is if, as the name implies,
as you start heading down

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.746
one path, and maybe you take a left fork,

00:12:00.746 --> 00:12:03.987
then you're confronted
with some other forks,

00:12:03.987 --> 00:12:07.300
but you no longer have the
option of the right fork

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.500
you would have taken, perhaps
if you'd seen, later on,

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.810
what were the consequences
of going on the left fork.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:17.080
And so this is the idea
of path dependence,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.057
things that are done
earlier shaped the choices

00:12:20.057 --> 00:12:22.602
of things that are coming later.

00:12:22.602 --> 00:12:26.633
Now if you have a very
centralized political system,

00:12:26.633 --> 00:12:30.340
that may not matter very
much, so say in Britain

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.230
where they have strong parties,
I'll talk more about that

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.140
on Thursday, they can do
things like nationalized

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.822
and denationalized and
renationalized British rail.

00:12:40.822 --> 00:12:45.100
It's relatively simple
because most political power

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.840
resides in the House of Commons,
so they can make decisions

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.780
that are decisive, and they can revert.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.615
If the incentives change
or new information arises,

00:12:55.615 --> 00:12:58.157
they can make a different policy.

00:12:58.157 --> 00:13:02.343
Our system is designed to be
extremely difficult to change,

00:13:02.343 --> 00:13:07.343
and so there are multiple
veto players in the system,

00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:12.063
as we've discussed in earlier
classes with the bicameralism,

00:13:12.063 --> 00:13:15.640
with the separation of powers,
with the presidentialism,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.575
with the federalism, with
the Senate filibuster rules

00:13:19.575 --> 00:13:24.575
and with the over
representation of small states

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.820
in the Senate, with the court.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.820
All of these veto players
mean that the choices made,

00:13:33.352 --> 00:13:37.874
once they're embedded, are
very difficult to change,

00:13:37.874 --> 00:13:40.730
and we talked about
this in connection also

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.050
with embedding proximate
goals, that you want to make

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.690
your approximate goals
difficult to change.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.690
And so FDR, in the case of
Social Security, found a way

00:13:51.712 --> 00:13:56.712
to use the inertia in the system
to protect Social Security.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.700
But the inertia is there, and
it means that path dependence

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.503
is a much bigger deal in the US system

00:14:04.503 --> 00:14:06.491
than in other systems.

00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:11.491
And so as we go through these
two examples of K through 12

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.733
education and healthcare,
you're going to see

00:14:14.733 --> 00:14:18.430
the fiscal federalism and
the inertia that privileges

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.770
path dependent popping up
again and again and again

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.449
and making, creating
substantially bigger challenges

00:14:25.449 --> 00:14:30.410
for these sorts of policies in
the US than we see elsewhere.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.920
So I asked you to read the
Dale Russakoff's "The Prize"

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:39.920
about New Jersey educational
reform and let's just

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.680
get our minds around that
with a look at this video.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.840
- Republican Governor Chris Christie,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.570
Democratic Mayor of Newark, Cory Booker

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.510
and the founder of
Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg,

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:58.490
are putting politics
aside to help turn around

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.780
the failing public schools
in Newark, New Jersey.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.220
This is the first time all three
of you really come together

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.204
to talk about this big idea.

00:15:07.204 --> 00:15:09.800
So, Mayor Booker, for
those who don't know,

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.340
what's the big news?

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.290
- Well, we've been talking
for quite some time

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.920
about creating a bold new paradigm

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.980
for educational excellence in
the country to show the way,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.970
to put the people of the city of Newark

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.667
really in the driver's
seat and the focal point,

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:24.490
and to work to get all the
assets and resources we need

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.226
to give to them to succeed.

00:15:26.226 --> 00:15:28.920
- So, Governor Christie,
what are you committing to?

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.160
What are you committing to?

00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:32.300
- What I'm committed to
is changing the schools

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.524
in the city where I was born,

00:15:33.524 --> 00:15:36.217
I spent the first years of
my life, and Mayor Booker

00:15:36.217 --> 00:15:40.230
is going to be the point
person, our lead guy in Newark

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.820
in helping to develop
this entirely new plan

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.470
of how to reform the
education system in Newark

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:47.039
and create a national model.

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:48.580
I'm empowering him to do that.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.843
I'm in charge of the public schools

00:15:49.843 --> 00:15:51.880
in the city of Newark as Governor.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.127
I'm going to empower Mayor
Booker to develop that plan

00:15:54.127 --> 00:15:56.920
and to implement it with a
superintendent of schools

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.700
that we're going to pick together.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:00.210
- I think that is so fantastic.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.120
(audience applauds)

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.393
I think that is so fantastic.

00:16:06.393 --> 00:16:09.040
In this age of red states and blue states

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.098
and everybody being so
partisan about everything,

00:16:12.098 --> 00:16:14.350
the fact that you all would come together,

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:15.643
did that ever enter
into it, the politics of

00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:18.090
you're a Republican and he's a Democrat?

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:19.553
- No, it's about the children.

00:16:19.553 --> 00:16:21.324
I mean, you go to Newark.

00:16:21.324 --> 00:16:24.324
(audience applauds)

00:16:25.601 --> 00:16:28.920
Go to Newark and you watch,
as you saw in the movie,

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.150
and there's other movies that
display this about parents

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.100
and children sitting in a
gymnasium waiting to see if

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.930
their number gets picked out of a barrel

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:40.600
and watching parents sob, and
I met a woman who got her son

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.990
into one of the best
charter schools in Newark,

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.210
the Robert Treat Academy,
and her son was now

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:46.740
in the third grade at
that point, and I said,

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.400
what was it like the
night you got him in it?

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.070
She said when I was waiting
that gym, I knew that whether

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.450
his number got picked out
was the difference between

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.339
him going to college or going to jail.

00:16:55.339 --> 00:16:56.720
- [Oprah] Ah, yeah.

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.920
- No mother in America
should have to sit there

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.950
and by chance decide that,
and when I heard that,

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.052
that's when I was US Attorney,
when I heard that story,

00:17:05.052 --> 00:17:10.052
that turns my entire attitude
towards putting this first,

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.130
and he feels that way too and
now we've got another partner

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.970
with us to make it happen.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.730
- If we as a nation keep
pulling left and right,

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:18.209
we will never move forward, and.

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:19.223
(audience applauds)

00:17:19.223 --> 00:17:21.915
Yeah.

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:23.355
Most of us understand that.

00:17:23.355 --> 00:17:24.754
Most of us understand that.

00:17:24.754 --> 00:17:27.960
- So, Mr. Zuckerberg,
what role are you playing

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.877
in all of this?

00:17:28.877 --> 00:17:30.070
(room laughs)

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.150
Are the rumors true?

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.330
Will there be a check
offered at some point?

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:34.163
Yes.

00:17:34.163 --> 00:17:36.440
- Well yeah, I've committed to starting

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.440
the Startup: Education
Foundation, whose first project

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.190
will be a $100 million challenge grant.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:45.191
- $100 million.

00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:48.191
(audience applauds)

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.300
Yo yo yo yo yo.

00:17:54.344 --> 00:17:57.177
(audience cheers)

00:18:00.834 --> 00:18:03.417
(Oprah laughs)

00:18:04.521 --> 00:18:07.670
So okay, so why education and why Newark?

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.660
- Why education?

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:11.740
Because every child
deserves a good education

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.897
and right now that's not happening.

00:18:12.897 --> 00:18:16.112
(audience applauds)

00:18:16.112 --> 00:18:19.590
I mean, I've had a lot of
opportunities in my life

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.510
and a lot of that comes from, you know,

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.330
having gone to really good
schools and I just want to do

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.100
what I can to make sure that everyone

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.320
has those same opportunities.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.050
- And why Newark, though
because, you know,

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.550
what's your relationship with Newark?

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.200
- Well, Newark is really just because

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.193
I believe in these guys, right?

00:18:34.193 --> 00:18:37.193
(audience applauds)

00:18:40.865 --> 00:18:44.640
Running a company, the main
thing that I have to do

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:47.030
is find people who are going
to be really great leaders

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.040
and invest in them, and
that's what we're doing here.

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.026
We're setting up a $100
million challenge grant

00:18:52.026 --> 00:18:54.745
so that Mayor Booker and Governor Christie

00:18:54.745 --> 00:18:57.350
can have the flexibility
that they need to implement

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.750
new programs in Newark and
really make a difference

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.760
and turn Newark into a symbol
of educational excellence

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.810
for the whole nation.

00:19:05.135 --> 00:19:09.873
- So, that is not a good
way to make social policy.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.830
It was a predictable train wreck

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:17.030
and I asked you to read
it for two reasons.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:21.810
One is the brilliant depiction

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.189
of the extent of the problem in Newark.

00:19:24.189 --> 00:19:29.160
I mean, it is very, we
we live increasingly

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.645
in segmented worlds where we call it,

00:19:32.645 --> 00:19:36.500
we talked about soft apartheid earlier,

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.460
but it's difficult to overstate
the devastated neighborhoods

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:46.460
in the school system,
which had been taken over

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.655
by the state some years before.

00:19:49.655 --> 00:19:53.530
The dropout rates and failure
rates that she describes

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.190
are just mind blowing.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:01.190
So, it is a very sobering
description of the extent

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:06.450
of the problem of public education
in America's inner cities

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.621
and I think Newark is certainly,

00:20:08.621 --> 00:20:12.026
in that respect, quite typical.

00:20:12.026 --> 00:20:14.760
But I also wanted to have you read it

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:19.692
because it is so clearly designed to,

00:20:19.692 --> 00:20:22.410
if it had been designed to fail,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.416
this is how one would have designed it.

00:20:24.416 --> 00:20:27.010
It wasn't actually 100
million, it was 200 million,

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.699
because it was a challenge
grant and other foundations

00:20:29.699 --> 00:20:32.917
put up additional money.

00:20:32.917 --> 00:20:35.500
And there were variety of reasons that

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.386
it was almost destined to fail.

00:20:38.386 --> 00:20:42.520
One was the top down and mandate quality

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.410
of the whole effort.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.780
It was later revealed huge
amounts of money were wasted

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:53.780
on consultants, who paid
themselves to write long reports.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:59.750
There was almost no buy-in from
the parents of the children

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.946
in the schools concerned,

00:21:03.946 --> 00:21:08.946
and the neighborhood-based
funding model resists

00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:10.947
this kind of injection.

00:21:10.947 --> 00:21:13.360
$200 million sounds like a lot of money.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.600
The Newark schools' budget, of course,

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.000
is billions and billions, so at most,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.660
these could be some kind
of demonstration projects,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.330
they're not going to have a big impact.

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:28.980
Very little of the money
went into classrooms.

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:33.103
Much of it went into
administrative reform.

00:21:34.089 --> 00:21:37.280
And the other thing that they did was

00:21:38.356 --> 00:21:41.947
they brought in a

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:48.570
school superintendent,

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.450
who we'll hear more
from, who was confronted

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:57.417
with the difficulty
that by creating impetus

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.260
to increase charter
schools, which are schools

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:08.020
that are funded with taxpayer
money, but are not subject

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:13.020
to the same kinds of regulation,
the issue becomes twofold.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.920
One, are the charter schools better?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.650
Which generates a lot of controversy,

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.381
some are some are not, and
on average, it's not fair

00:22:21.381 --> 00:22:23.780
that they are, but then secondly,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:27.910
what happens to the children
who are left behind?

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.381
And this is the ones who do not
go into the charter schools.

00:22:32.381 --> 00:22:36.857
And so what you get is
essentially an accentuation

00:22:36.857 --> 00:22:41.080
of differential options due to

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.700
fewer and fewer possibilities
of upward mobility.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.653
The emphasis on charter
schools, Cami Anderson was the,

00:22:50.653 --> 00:22:53.924
she was, she had the
added disadvantage that

00:22:53.924 --> 00:22:58.924
the population is
overwhelmingly African American

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:04.027
and she was the first
white school superintendent

00:23:04.027 --> 00:23:08.890
brought in, but she, she
correctly identified this

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:13.277
as what she called a lifeboat
theory of public education,

00:23:13.277 --> 00:23:16.195
that is you take some
children out of the schools,

00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:20.240
the failing schools and you
send them to the charter schools

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.150
and it's a lifeboat for
that child but then you have

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.960
to think of, if it's
a good charter school,

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.960
but then you have to think
about what is the likely effect

00:23:30.155 --> 00:23:34.352
on the children who remain behind?

00:23:34.352 --> 00:23:38.570
This is very comparable to
the school voucher movement

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.940
that gained a lot of traction in the 1990s

00:23:43.336 --> 00:23:47.730
and has now actually come back,
we'll see, with Betsy DeVos

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:51.740
and the Trump administration,
but so again the notion here

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.033
was that it's a Hirschman
story that if you

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.440
think about America's school system we,

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.010
first of all we have private schools,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:06.333
so people who can afford
private schools can leave,

00:24:08.824 --> 00:24:13.824
and that that means that,
their relatively low exit cost

00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:18.390
mean that they don't have
the incentive to stay

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:22.403
and exercise voice to improve
the system for the rest.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:28.240
And so, like the charter schools movement,

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.240
the vouchers movement pressed
by these two academics,

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:38.439
John Chubb and Terry Moe, the
idea was that the government

00:24:38.962 --> 00:24:43.962
should give vouchers to parents,

00:24:44.363 --> 00:24:47.300
and that they would create competition,

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.210
first competition within
the public schools,

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.090
and so the competition, if you like,

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.996
would would give poor people,
and this was a sort of

00:24:55.996 --> 00:25:00.545
had a populist flavor to
it, poor people the capacity

00:25:00.545 --> 00:25:04.383
to move to better schools
and that would put pressure

00:25:04.383 --> 00:25:07.930
on the worst school to improve themselves

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.280
or go out of business.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.680
And so this was the public
schools' variant of it,

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.978
and then increasingly
there was pressure, also,

00:25:16.978 --> 00:25:19.671
to let these vouchers be used in private

00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:22.693
and parochial schools, and indeed,

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:29.390
that was challenged in the
courts, because if you,

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.700
a lot of these schools
were Catholic schools,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.700
religious schools, but in 2002
by a five to four decision,

00:25:36.895 --> 00:25:38.953
the court said it was okay.

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:42.750
It was Rehnquist, I believe,
writing the majority opinion.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.380
It was okay to use taxpayer
money for vouchers,

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.272
even if they were going
to be spent in religious

00:25:49.272 --> 00:25:53.950
parochial schools, so that
in effect it's violating

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.380
the so-called wall of separation
between church and state,

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:03.380
so this was another way to
try and diminish the costs

00:26:03.828 --> 00:26:08.828
being experienced by people in the system

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:14.740
by introducing some kind of
competition and better options

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.280
for children in the public schools.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:23.280
But as Cami Anderson says
at one point, she says

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.850
she didn't come here

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:32.000
to rearrange the deck
chairs on the Titanic.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.680
And so basically what
happened in Newark was that

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.560
about 40% of the children
wound up going to these

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:46.010
newly improved charter
schools chosen by lotteries,

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:50.155
and the remaining 60% of the kids were in

00:26:50.155 --> 00:26:54.180
even more underfunded schools in the rest

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:59.180
of the public system that's
bred so much of the backlash,

00:27:01.011 --> 00:27:04.936
and what we have seen in
the wake of the failure

00:27:04.936 --> 00:27:09.820
of that initiative is quite
a substantial backlash

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.300
against the school reform movement,

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.786
both backlash against
charters and against vouchers,

00:27:17.786 --> 00:27:22.334
both of which, predictably,
are strongly opposed

00:27:22.334 --> 00:27:26.160
by teachers' unions and
teachers' unions turn out to be

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:29.850
one of the few relatively
potent union movements

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.770
left in America.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.770
So in Newark in 2014,
Ras Baraka became Mayor

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.340
after defeating another
pro-charter candidate

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:48.320
who went on to become
president of the pro-charter

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.290
Democrats for Education Reform,

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:54.250
and he was reelected
with over 77% of the vote

00:27:55.098 --> 00:27:57.030
four years later.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:02.030
In New York, this was a central
plank of de Blasio's victory

00:28:02.048 --> 00:28:06.790
with 73% of the vote in 2013,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:10.871
a strident anti-charter
campaign ushering in an era

00:28:10.871 --> 00:28:13.800
of feuding with the various proponents,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:18.530
and he was also reelected
by a huge majority.

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:23.530
Rahm Emanuel in Chicago,
longtime former Chief of Staff

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.483
of Barack Obama, longtime
mayor of Chicago,

00:28:28.541 --> 00:28:32.370
also has run into massive
backlash in Chicago

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:36.730
over the Chicago charter schools.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.811
2016, Hillary Clinton was,
who had also been a longtime

00:28:40.811 --> 00:28:45.811
advocate of charter schools,
was forced to back away

00:28:46.002 --> 00:28:49.447
and reverse her long standing support.

00:28:49.447 --> 00:28:54.447
And, indeed, in January of
this year, there was a huge

00:28:56.060 --> 00:29:00.060
teacher strike in Los
Angeles, and it was just when

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:04.950
the candidates were announcing,
you know, declaring interest

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:09.950
in running for President,
and all of the wannabe

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:14.060
Democratic candidates quickly
came out in strong support

00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.480
of this strike, a central
pillar of which was to try

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:22.480
and stop the expansion of
charter schools in Los Angeles,

00:29:22.514 --> 00:29:27.480
and Cory Booker, who
you saw in that video,

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.517
had actually long been an advocate

00:29:29.517 --> 00:29:32.378
of charter schools, was very quick

00:29:32.378 --> 00:29:36.140
to announce his support for that strike.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.570
So the fight over vouchers
continues in 2018.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:45.570
The Trump administration cut
over three and a half billion

00:29:45.629 --> 00:29:49.020
out of the Department
of Education's budget,

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:54.020
and also devoted a billion to be spent

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:58.240
on private school vouchers and
other school choice programs,

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.015
so there's an ongoing political battle,

00:30:01.015 --> 00:30:06.015
but it's extremely difficult
to see a path forward

00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:10.010
for this kind of educational reform,

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:15.010
which tends to be piecemeal,
city by city, you know,

00:30:16.103 --> 00:30:19.585
high visibility initiative by
high visibility initiative,

00:30:19.585 --> 00:30:22.724
but doesn't get at the systemic challenges

00:30:22.724 --> 00:30:26.780
of the decentralized system, the.

00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.780
By the way, efforts to get
reform through the courts

00:30:32.957 --> 00:30:35.761
of the neighborhood-based funding system

00:30:35.761 --> 00:30:39.920
have also been rejected
by the Supreme Court,

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.460
so you can't go that route either,

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.460
and it makes K through 12
education a real challenge

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.344
and you can see that it's gotten worse.

00:30:53.344 --> 00:30:57.615
This is the divergence of
educational opportunity

00:30:57.615 --> 00:31:01.330
over the 40 years, up to 2010.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:04.187
You can see, if you look
at the top income quartile,

00:31:04.187 --> 00:31:08.198
number of children getting
college degrees has doubled,

00:31:08.198 --> 00:31:13.198
but if you go to the next
quartile, between 50 and 75%,

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:18.020
it's grown, it's also doubled,
but to a lower number,

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.280
but in the bottom two quartiles,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.641
there's basically been no expansion

00:31:22.641 --> 00:31:27.514
of educational opportunity measured as

00:31:27.514 --> 00:31:31.210
getting a college degree,
so no upward mobility

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.690
for the bottom half of the population,

00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:36.960
despite the increase in upward mobility

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.648
for people at the top.

00:31:38.648 --> 00:31:41.871
So, these local efforts largely fail.

00:31:41.871 --> 00:31:46.440
One counterexample example
to this, by the way,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.540
is New Orleans where,
after Hurricane Katrina

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.890
pretty much wiped out the whole
school system, they put in

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.073
a system that is almost
exclusively charter schools.

00:31:59.073 --> 00:32:03.530
And there are, again, contending debates

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:05.726
about the merits of these schools.

00:32:05.726 --> 00:32:08.430
There's a, I think, a general perception

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:11.190
that they're an improvement, but that is

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.920
a very unusual situation
where you have your entire

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.340
school system wiped out
by an exogenous shock

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.510
and can redesign from scratch,

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:23.400
and thereby defy some
of the path dependencies

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.965
that have been built into the system.

00:32:25.965 --> 00:32:30.965
Now, so this is the sort of
pragmatic piecemeal solutions

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:33.752
at the local level.

00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:36.160
We should talk a little
bit about what efforts

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.960
have been made at the
national level where,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.370
as in most countries
educational policy is decided,

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.302
and there have been efforts.

00:32:45.302 --> 00:32:50.302
Probably the most notable
one in recent decades

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.580
was the 1965 Elementary
and Secondary Education Act

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.166
that was put in place by
the Johnson administration,

00:33:02.166 --> 00:33:06.070
and they were able to do that first of all

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:09.500
because of the huge
landslide that they won

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:14.030
in the 1964 elections,
and it also gave Johnson

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.657
his mandate for other
elements of the Great Society

00:33:16.657 --> 00:33:19.776
and the Civil Rights
and Voting Rights Acts

00:33:19.776 --> 00:33:21.710
that we have talked about.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.885
He also engaged in in very
clever coalition building

00:33:24.885 --> 00:33:28.690
politics, thinking back to our
lecture on building blocks.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:33.690
So for example, there had long
been opposition from groups,

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.722
parochial groups, Catholics and so on,

00:33:39.722 --> 00:33:44.722
for the federal government's
giving money to local school

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:50.503
districts because it wouldn't
benefit Catholic students,

00:33:50.503 --> 00:33:55.503
and so he instead devised
a plan where the money

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.960
would actually go to the
students and not to the schools,

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.400
and so the argument was
that the federal government

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.400
was not supporting religious schools.

00:34:08.993 --> 00:34:12.822
This is before the Supreme
Court decided, as it had

00:34:12.822 --> 00:34:16.074
in the voucher cases,
that would come later.

00:34:16.074 --> 00:34:20.922
But then secondly, civil rights advocates

00:34:20.922 --> 00:34:25.156
and advocates of minority
groups had also opposed

00:34:25.156 --> 00:34:29.314
giving money to segregated schools,

00:34:29.314 --> 00:34:33.279
because if you gave money
to segregated schools,

00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:36.530
it was federal money
to segregated schools,

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:40.190
gonna reinforce probably,
or so it was believed,

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.950
the advantages achieved by children

00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:45.490
in predominantly white schools.

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:50.470
With the Civil Rights Act and
the Voting Rights Act passing,

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:53.080
but particularly with the
Civil Rights Act passing,

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:55.978
those urban liberal
groups got turned around

00:34:55.978 --> 00:34:58.200
and now became supporters.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.230
So, the Johnson administration was,

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:04.510
it was a pretty big policy.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.714
It was a billion dollars which
would be eight billion today,

00:35:08.714 --> 00:35:13.714
rising to 4.2 billion later in the decade,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.590
which would be $31 billion
today, and literally

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:22.900
a tenfold increase on what
the federal government

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.810
had been spending a decade earlier,

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:29.120
so it was a really
substantial federal program,

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:33.040
but it soon came under
Republican attack by 1968.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:36.287
Of course the Nixon
administration had come on

00:35:36.287 --> 00:35:39.193
and it was very
inefficiently administered.

00:35:39.193 --> 00:35:43.659
Much of it was spent on
local school administration

00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:48.150
and not on classrooms,
but also it was basically

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:51.911
remedial education, and
they ran into the problem

00:35:51.911 --> 00:35:56.911
that Russakoff also identifies
in the New Jersey schools,

00:35:57.644 --> 00:36:02.644
that essentially trying to
tackle underachieving children

00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:10.143
in the classroom is, it's too
far downstream from the causes

00:36:10.143 --> 00:36:13.280
of the problem and so
you have these programs

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:16.880
that improve kids' performance
over the summer, let's say,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.674
but over the school year,
but then, over the summer,

00:36:21.674 --> 00:36:25.473
they tend to, most of
the benefits dissipate

00:36:25.473 --> 00:36:27.501
and when they come back
the following year,

00:36:27.501 --> 00:36:32.060
many of the apparent
advantages have gone away

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.170
and this had actually been
identified by a sociologist

00:36:36.397 --> 00:36:41.397
name of Coleman in 1966
that remedial programs

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.744
don't really work, and this
is the same message that

00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:49.744
actually Zuckerberg took away
from the failure in Newark

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.740
that if you're really going to address

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.515
the problems of inner city schools,

00:36:54.515 --> 00:36:58.450
you have to start with the
homes and the neighborhoods

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:02.933
and what people are eating
and where they are sleeping

00:37:02.933 --> 00:37:05.950
and whether they're sleeping and

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.444
the basic capacities
that need to be developed

00:37:13.444 --> 00:37:17.250
cannot just be developed in classrooms.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:20.475
So, that didn't go well.

00:37:20.475 --> 00:37:24.670
The next big federal
effort was in the 2001

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.260
reauthorization of the SCA.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:31.000
This was the reauthorization
of the legislation

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.310
that had been passed in 1965
and this was the so-called

00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:39.310
No Child Left Behind
program put in place by

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:42.730
the George W. Bush administration.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.710
I think I got the wrong date on there.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.346
It was actually 2002.

00:37:47.346 --> 00:37:51.630
The idea here was to
identify certain benchmarks

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:56.630
that had to be met in order
to get federal funding.

00:37:56.779 --> 00:38:01.374
It was largely attacked.

00:38:01.374 --> 00:38:03.754
It was roundly attacked from all sides,

00:38:03.754 --> 00:38:08.451
partly because it was
seen as much too top down,

00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:11.270
even though there were
there were concessions

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.940
like allowing each district
or each state, at any rate,

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.240
to identify the benchmarks
that had to be met,

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.740
but then this produced
critiques to the effect

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.970
that they were manipulating
the benchmarks in order

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:28.320
to show the results of
improvement on the one hand,

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.280
and that other districts,
which were actually

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.588
achieving absolute gains, but
didn't meet the benchmarks,

00:38:33.588 --> 00:38:35.176
weren't getting the funds.

00:38:35.176 --> 00:38:39.250
And so it was again
attacked from all sides,

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:43.070
strongly resisted by
teachers unions as teaching

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:46.634
to the test, not providing
genuine education

00:38:46.634 --> 00:38:51.634
and manipulation of the test and so on.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.260
Finally, what was left
of it was pretty much

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.720
put out of its misery by the
Obama administration in 2015,

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.950
where they turned over what
was left of the program

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.660
to the states.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.043
So, it's very difficult to
see how you put together

00:39:09.043 --> 00:39:14.043
a national coalition to
address K through 12 education,

00:39:14.267 --> 00:39:18.454
partly for all the reasons
I've already identified,

00:39:18.454 --> 00:39:23.454
and the one final thing to
say is that the coalition

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:29.510
to demand it is not there
because at the very high end,

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:33.030
of course, the American
system is extremely good,

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:34.920
so people in private schools,

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:39.920
people in wealthy neighborhoods
where the public schools

00:39:39.955 --> 00:39:42.987
are very good have no real incentive

00:39:42.987 --> 00:39:47.070
in this highly decentralized,
locally funded system.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.065
They have no incentive to get behind

00:39:50.065 --> 00:39:54.343
any kind of comprehensive reform.

00:39:54.343 --> 00:39:57.870
And, you know, I think I
mentioned to you earlier

00:39:57.870 --> 00:40:01.183
in the course I used to live
in Guilford, Connecticut,

00:40:01.183 --> 00:40:06.183
and I watched over a course
of decades as the proportion

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.360
of people living in the
town with children decreased

00:40:11.305 --> 00:40:15.200
because of the graying of
that population of that town,

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.312
it became increasingly difficult
to pass the town budget

00:40:18.312 --> 00:40:22.181
because there's a lot of
genteel poverty in those towns,

00:40:22.181 --> 00:40:25.320
there's a lot of resentment
of school teachers

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.251
who have good unions and good jobs,

00:40:28.251 --> 00:40:31.250
and so people who maybe inherited a house

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:35.180
but can't pay the taxes on
it, they show up and vote down

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:37.865
the town budget because
half of it is the schools,

00:40:37.865 --> 00:40:41.374
and so you have a big
divided dollar problem.

00:40:41.374 --> 00:40:45.180
In that case, eventually the
Connecticut State Supreme Court

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.500
ordered the raising of the
mill rate on the grounds

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:53.303
that there's a right to an education,

00:40:53.303 --> 00:40:58.303
Connecticut state constitutional
right to an education,

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.810
so they limited the damage in that way,

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:06.177
But the combination of
the fiscal federalism

00:41:06.177 --> 00:41:10.490
and the Hirschmanesque
problem that if you decrease

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:13.088
exit costs, which sounds
good to give people

00:41:13.088 --> 00:41:16.650
other opportunities, you
increase voice costs,

00:41:16.650 --> 00:41:19.731
and you make it less likely
that the residual system

00:41:19.731 --> 00:41:21.888
is going to be improved.

00:41:21.888 --> 00:41:25.560
So, that is the rather depressing story

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.480
of K through 12 education in America.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:32.463
Let's talk about health insurance.

00:41:32.463 --> 00:41:36.362
And here again it's in many respects,

00:41:36.362 --> 00:41:39.404
a depressing story that
exhibits infirmities

00:41:39.404 --> 00:41:44.404
of the education system,
though not as as depressing

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.900
as the K through 12 education story

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.900
and actually we have a proposal
that might actually work.

00:41:54.183 --> 00:41:59.183
So thinking about the
healthcare system, the US system

00:41:59.256 --> 00:42:04.256
is unusual in two respects
for any advanced democracy.

00:42:05.123 --> 00:42:09.618
One is that there is
not universal coverage,

00:42:09.618 --> 00:42:13.250
and the other is that we have
these employer-based systems.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:18.250
Most people get their
insurance through their work.

00:42:18.623 --> 00:42:23.623
180 million Americans, at
least, get their insurance

00:42:24.142 --> 00:42:26.223
through their work.

00:42:27.396 --> 00:42:30.776
Now you might say well,
why did we get this system?

00:42:30.776 --> 00:42:35.070
And here's a good example
of the path dependency issue

00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.520
that I was talking about.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.153
In 1942 during World War II,

00:42:41.153 --> 00:42:45.701
the government instituted wage controls.

00:42:45.701 --> 00:42:49.160
Employers were not allowed
to give pay raises,

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.760
but there were also great labor shortages,

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.020
and so employers were
looking for ways to compete

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.370
for labor, for workers.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:02.513
And so the following year,
the War Labor Board said,

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:06.162
well, benefits would not count as wages,

00:43:06.162 --> 00:43:10.330
and so what happened was that
employers started giving out

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:14.500
health insurance as a way
of increasing the real wage

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.890
they were paying to workers
without violating the stricture

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:23.890
that the wage freeze that was
the case had been put in place

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.110
for the duration of the war.

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:30.640
And so this meant massive
increase by the end of the war

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.910
in this this employer
provided health insurance,

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:36.470
and then of course, once you have it,

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.259
the people who have it don't
want to give it up, right?

00:43:39.259 --> 00:43:43.535
And so this is a very sort of micro

00:43:43.535 --> 00:43:48.535
but poignant illustration
of how the path dependency

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.233
for a system can get
going and then accelerate.

00:43:54.615 --> 00:43:59.615
So we don't have a universal
system partly for that reason,

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.453
but there are other reasons as well.

00:44:08.452 --> 00:44:13.452
One is the employer-based
I've already mentioned,

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.959
but the other is
Medicare, as I said to you

00:44:16.959 --> 00:44:20.991
a little while ago that
Medicare was a very

00:44:20.991 --> 00:44:25.651
major achievement in 1965,
single payer healthcare

00:44:25.651 --> 00:44:28.403
for people over the age of 65.

00:44:28.403 --> 00:44:33.403
The problem with doing
that is that it creates

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.360
a potential fissure in
the coalition of people

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.750
to demand universal health insurance,

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:44.626
because the elderly
now have what they need

00:44:44.626 --> 00:44:47.130
and the employed have what they need,

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.820
and so those groups of people don't have

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:55.000
much of an incentive to support expansion,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.210
particularly if you
think about the elderly,

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:03.032
because when we look at
these Democratic plans

00:45:03.032 --> 00:45:07.970
on offer from the candidate,
you know, Elizabeth Warren

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:12.970
initially costed her Medicare
For All at $20 trillion.

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:17.013
Most of the independent
evaluations are closer

00:45:17.013 --> 00:45:20.057
to double that and even
she is now being forced

00:45:20.057 --> 00:45:22.690
to walk away from that.

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.919
But if you think of the
available pool of resources

00:45:26.919 --> 00:45:31.919
for health insurance as
finite, expanding the coverage

00:45:31.919 --> 00:45:34.748
is going to come at the
probably the cost of coverage

00:45:34.748 --> 00:45:38.050
for people who already have it.

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:43.050
So, this patchwork of partial
provision makes it harder

00:45:43.518 --> 00:45:47.600
to generate the demand
for a universal system,

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:51.510
unlike Britain for example,
which put in a universal system

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:56.243
in one fell swoop for everybody in 1947

00:45:56.243 --> 00:45:58.589
under the Attlee government.

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:02.594
So those are among the obstacles.

00:46:02.594 --> 00:46:07.594
And then Medicaid is stigmatized
as a poor persons' program,

00:46:07.993 --> 00:46:12.240
and so not viewed as a desirable thing

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.430
for people to want to have.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:16.920
And it's also caught
up in fiscal federalism

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.370
because it's funded with
certain amounts of money

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.560
that come from the federal
governments to the states,

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.275
but then they have to raise the
difference in local taxation

00:46:26.275 --> 00:46:31.050
and so that creates huge amounts
of pressure on the states

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:36.050
to limit what Medicaid is
going to cover because,

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.862
particularly in recent decades

00:46:37.862 --> 00:46:42.130
as the federal government
has reduced what it provides

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.582
and has gone to systems of block grants,

00:46:44.582 --> 00:46:49.582
which again are not sensitive
to changes in the populations

00:46:49.905 --> 00:46:52.450
that are actually being served.

00:46:52.450 --> 00:46:57.450
So that's another set of
obstacles, and it's in this context

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:03.346
that we have to think about
the Obama legislation.

00:47:03.346 --> 00:47:08.346
And it's much pilloried
and it's got many defects

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.300
to it, but it's worth pausing
just to note what it did

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:17.220
in fact achieve, given the
place we're starting from.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.604
It did increase coverage
for about 20 million people.

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:23.360
There are still about 32 million uninsured

00:47:24.316 --> 00:47:27.690
and 44 million what are
called underinsured,

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.457
and underinsured people are people

00:47:29.457 --> 00:47:30.990
who have partial coverage,

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:35.990
but the copays or the
conditions that are not covered

00:47:37.343 --> 00:47:41.010
put extreme fiscal
financial stress on them,

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:46.010
and so if you look at this
chart you can see that

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:51.240
the number of uninsured
actually came down,

00:47:51.457 --> 00:47:56.457
not insignificantly as a
result of the Obama law,

00:47:59.294 --> 00:48:02.350
and it should also be said that Obama

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:09.310
was the fifth administration
since the war to have tried

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.660
to do universal healthcare.

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.570
So many administrations have tried before,

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:20.040
and the only success had
been the partial creation of

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.350
Medicare in 1965,

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:27.713
so it's not an insubstantial achievement.

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.558
But the way in which it
was enacted tells you a lot

00:48:31.558 --> 00:48:35.950
about the pathologies of the
American political system,

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:40.440
and that's what I want to
focus the rest of our time on.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.273
So,

00:48:43.383 --> 00:48:46.880
if you think about
Obama coming into office

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.510
in January of 2009, and this is one of

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:53.733
the top issues on the agenda.

00:48:53.733 --> 00:48:57.120
After Dodd-Frank, this
is the number one issue,

00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.000
much to the chagrin of environmentalists

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.910
who wanted environmental stuff
to be the number two issue,

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:06.470
but Obama decided universal healthcare,

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:09.687
he had campaigned on it,
and he wanted to do it.

00:49:09.687 --> 00:49:12.370
And so, one issue

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.011
that was central to
trying to get this done

00:49:17.011 --> 00:49:19.610
was controlling costs.

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:23.220
Now, medical costs are high
for two reasons in America.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.683
If you plot the rate of inflation

00:49:27.683 --> 00:49:32.474
against the rate of medical
inflation in the US,

00:49:32.474 --> 00:49:35.875
what you find is that the
rate of medical inflation

00:49:35.875 --> 00:49:40.201
is sometimes three and
often at least two times

00:49:40.201 --> 00:49:43.499
as the rate of regular
inflation, so medical costs

00:49:43.499 --> 00:49:47.623
are going up faster than
the rate of inflation.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.259
And you might say well, why is that?

00:49:50.259 --> 00:49:53.983
So one reason is the lack of
universal coverage itself,

00:49:53.983 --> 00:49:58.192
because what it means is
that people without coverage

00:49:58.192 --> 00:50:01.057
essentially use emergency room care

00:50:02.703 --> 00:50:05.590
for their basic medical provisions

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.120
and that's about the most
expensive possible way

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:12.120
to give people healthcare,
because the overhead

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:16.240
involved in running an
emergency room is enormous,

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:20.815
and so then hospitals tend
to pass on those costs

00:50:20.815 --> 00:50:25.313
to everybody else in the
form of higher prices.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:31.190
So that's a big part of the
reason that medical inflation

00:50:34.705 --> 00:50:39.705
is so high, and then a
second piece of it is that

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:44.100
the cost of drugs to
the federal government

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:48.660
is extremely expensive,
because when Medicare Part D

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.222
was created by the George
W. Bush administration

00:50:52.222 --> 00:50:56.623
in the early part of the century,

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:02.517
this is free prescription
drug benefits for seniors,

00:51:02.517 --> 00:51:04.361
people on Medicare.

00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:09.159
They forewent the opportunity
to negotiate drug prices

00:51:09.159 --> 00:51:13.480
for the federal government
directly with the drug companies.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:16.875
If the federal government's
going to be this big purchaser,

00:51:16.875 --> 00:51:20.956
they obviously have a lot of
leverage in price negotiations.

00:51:20.956 --> 00:51:23.785
But they forewent that
opportunity and you can see

00:51:23.785 --> 00:51:28.785
in the early years when when
when the Medicare Part D

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:31.250
was going through this, as you can see,

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:36.250
big increases in
lobbying, as that bill was

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:40.385
going through Congress,
to stop the proposal

00:51:40.385 --> 00:51:44.130
that the Democrats were
pushing at the time,

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:49.120
and even many Republicans,
to negotiate drug prices

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.850
with the pharmaceutical companies.

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:56.850
And so, when Obama came in in 2009,

00:51:56.881 --> 00:51:59.650
everybody who had studied the problem,

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:03.932
all the health policy experts
said, you have to deal

00:52:03.932 --> 00:52:07.100
with the cost question first,
because if you're going

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:10.612
to expand coverage, before you
deal with the cost question,

00:52:10.612 --> 00:52:15.377
then what's going to happen is, you know,

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:19.050
the sticker shock of this
for the American voter

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:21.480
is going to be out of sight,
and you're going to make

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.832
the whole program vulnerable.

00:52:23.832 --> 00:52:27.300
So that would mean taking on Big Pharma,

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:30.860
because as you can see,
as the Obama legislation

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.220
was going through
Congress, that the lobbying

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.740
also skyrocketed because
they were extremely concerned

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:38.573
about this issue.

00:52:38.573 --> 00:52:42.983
Obama had run on it in the
campaign, and he was determined

00:52:42.983 --> 00:52:45.564
to address it, so that's Big Pharma.

00:52:45.564 --> 00:52:49.350
But then the other
problem they had was that

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:54.350
if you create universal coverage,
particularly if you do it

00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:00.315
by including what was
called a public option,

00:53:00.315 --> 00:53:04.230
which meant that for
people who couldn't find

00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:06.390
private insurance, they would be able

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:09.673
to buy medical insurance
from the government.

00:53:10.996 --> 00:53:15.940
If they included in a public
option the thought there

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.150
was seen as several advantages to this.

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:23.451
One was it would make sure
that everybody would have

00:53:23.451 --> 00:53:25.590
the possibility of buying insurance,

00:53:25.590 --> 00:53:29.680
even in communities where,
there was no other insurers.

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.040
Secondly, it would force
competition into the system

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.050
and particularly in areas
where there was only

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:37.785
one private insurer, they
would now have to compete

00:53:37.785 --> 00:53:41.090
with the government
with the public option.

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:44.992
And thirdly, and perhaps most importantly

00:53:44.992 --> 00:53:49.020
from this perspective of
thinking about the pathologies

00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:51.493
of path dependency in the American system,

00:53:51.493 --> 00:53:56.283
it would be a path to eventually
creating Medicare For All,

00:53:56.283 --> 00:53:59.700
because more and more
people could gradually

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:02.630
move into the public option over time,

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:04.884
if it was providing better coverage.

00:54:04.884 --> 00:54:08.754
And so it would least
create the possibility

00:54:08.754 --> 00:54:13.180
of expanding the American
system into something

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:17.760
more recognizably like what
we see in other countries.

00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.760
But, adding the public
option meant that not only

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:26.310
would you have to take on Big Pharma,

00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:29.406
you would also have to take
on the insurance industries.

00:54:29.406 --> 00:54:34.406
Big Pharma or drugs, insurance,
a different part of the,

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:39.700
of the healthcare industry,
because for all the reasons

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:44.300
I've just given, they didn't
want the public option, right,

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:49.300
and so the big debate
in the administration,

00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:53.170
if you read the pop
books on the first years

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.615
of the Obama administration is, so,

00:54:55.615 --> 00:54:59.590
how to square this problem,
because if you don't

00:55:03.054 --> 00:55:06.076
solve the cost problem and
you expand the coverage,

00:55:06.076 --> 00:55:08.374
you're going to get the sticker shock,

00:55:08.374 --> 00:55:13.374
but if you try to do both of
these, you've got to take on

00:55:13.481 --> 00:55:16.890
two of the most effective
lobbying groups in America,

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:21.890
and as the lobbying went
on, it became clear that,

00:55:22.821 --> 00:55:27.040
or it became believed in the White House,

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.280
I don't know if it was clear or not,

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.070
but it became believed
that they couldn't fight

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:33.050
both of these battles at once.

00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:37.718
And so, against the advice
of the policy wonks,

00:55:37.718 --> 00:55:41.543
Obama punted on the drug controls,

00:55:41.543 --> 00:55:45.408
essentially, gave up on a public option

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:50.408
in return for some window
dressing, apparent cost savings

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:57.230
that, as we described in our
book, and I won't go through

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.840
in detail, were largely chimerical.

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.881
And so effectively they gave
up and abandoned the idea

00:56:03.881 --> 00:56:08.480
to negotiate drug prices in
order to get the Big Pharma

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:13.000
off the back of the administration
and the thought was,

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.870
it's more important at the end of the day

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:19.870
to increase coverage than it
is to fight this to battle

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.902
on two fronts, which we're
probably going to lose.

00:56:24.902 --> 00:56:29.902
And so that took Big
Pharma out of the picture

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.283
and actually they started
to support the bill.

00:56:36.398 --> 00:56:38.724
But the universal coverage problem

00:56:38.724 --> 00:56:42.420
was a much more difficult one,

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:46.542
and here you can see as
Obama is still pressing

00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:51.240
to try and get the public option adopted,

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:52.332
you can hear him making the case.

00:56:52.332 --> 00:56:55.370
- An additional step we can
take to keep insurance companies

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:58.660
honest is by making a not-for-profit
public option available

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:00.167
in the insurance exchange.

00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:02.834
(room applauds)

00:57:06.097 --> 00:57:07.477
Let me be clear.

00:57:07.477 --> 00:57:10.144
(room applauds)

00:57:13.469 --> 00:57:15.960
Let me be clear: it
would only be an option

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.221
for those who don't have insurance.

00:57:18.221 --> 00:57:21.437
No one would be forced to choose it,

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:23.421
and it would not impact those of you

00:57:23.421 --> 00:57:25.744
who already have insurance.

00:57:25.744 --> 00:57:29.382
In fact,-based on Congressional
Budget Office estimates,

00:57:29.382 --> 00:57:33.713
we believe that less than 5%
of Americans would sign up.

00:57:34.665 --> 00:57:37.433
Despite all this, insurance
companies and their allies

00:57:37.433 --> 00:57:38.898
don't like this idea.

00:57:38.898 --> 00:57:40.657
They argue that these private companies

00:57:40.657 --> 00:57:42.892
can't fairly compete with the government,

00:57:42.892 --> 00:57:47.168
and they'd be right if
taxpayers were subsidizing

00:57:47.168 --> 00:57:50.837
this public insurance
option, but they won't be.

00:57:50.837 --> 00:57:54.103
I've insisted that like any
private insurance company,

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:56.820
the public insurance
option would have to be

00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:00.371
self-sufficient, and rely
on the premiums it collects,

00:58:00.371 --> 00:58:03.500
but by avoiding some of the
overhead that gets eaten up

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.518
by private companies, by profits,

00:58:05.518 --> 00:58:08.506
excessive administrative
costs and executive salaries,

00:58:08.506 --> 00:58:11.577
it could provide a good deal for consumers

00:58:11.577 --> 00:58:14.520
and would also keep
pressure on private insurers

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:16.056
to keep their policies affordable

00:58:16.056 --> 00:58:17.680
and treat their customers better.

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.750
It is only one part of my
plan and shouldn't be used

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:23.930
as a handy excuse for the usual Washington

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:26.580
ideological battles,
but I will not back down

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:28.690
on the basic principle that if Americans

00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:30.400
can't find affordable coverage,

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.349
we will provide you with a choice.

00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:35.016
(room applauds)

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.410
- So the reason there
was all that applause

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:53.313
from the Democrats in the House
was that the previous month,

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:56.980
he had been getting cold
feet about the public option

00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.190
and in fact had made a couple
of speeches saying that

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:05.080
the public option was
not essential to the bill

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:07.630
and he wasn't going to fight
to the death to keep it

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:11.030
and this had produced big
backlash on the left of the party

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:16.030
and so he came out there
and made a strong speech

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:19.842
in favor keeping the
public option in the bill,

00:59:19.842 --> 00:59:24.842
and seemed to be suggesting
that it was non-negotiable.

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:28.430
But the insurance industry
had smell blood in the water

00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:31.685
by then and were going to work to try

00:59:31.685 --> 00:59:34.269
and get rid of the public option.

00:59:34.269 --> 00:59:38.900
And again we run into
some of the pathologies

00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:40.682
of the American system.

00:59:40.682 --> 00:59:45.670
As you all now know, you
need 60 votes in the Senate

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:50.026
to pass a bill, unless
it's budget reconciliation,

00:59:50.026 --> 00:59:52.360
when you only need 50 votes,

00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:55.850
as we talked about in the class on taxes.

00:59:55.850 --> 01:00:00.850
So you needed 60 votes,
and they had had 59 votes

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.750
for a long time, and finally
when Al Franken's recount

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:10.340
was resolved and he got his
seat, they were up to 60 votes

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:14.360
but the 16th vote was
from Connecticut Senator

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.058
Joseph Lieberman, and
he had indicated support

01:00:17.058 --> 01:00:20.160
for the legislation all along.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:25.160
But, Connecticut is one
of the insurance capitals

01:00:25.333 --> 01:00:30.333
of America, and so you can see here,

01:00:32.286 --> 01:00:35.603
you can get some sense of how
this was going to play out.

01:00:36.509 --> 01:00:40.430
- With us now Senator Joe
Lieberman of Connecticut.

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:45.070
You just heard the White House
top advisor on such things

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.773
saying that it is likely that
both the House and Senate

01:00:47.773 --> 01:00:50.900
will finally come up with
some kind of healthcare bill

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:53.801
that has some sort of public option in it.

01:00:53.801 --> 01:00:55.570
What's your take?

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:56.947
- I hope not.

01:00:56.947 --> 01:01:00.577
In other words, I'm all
for healthcare reform.

01:01:00.577 --> 01:01:03.530
We have a system that needs fixing,

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:05.787
but we've got some more
urgent problems than that,

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:09.210
and the first most urgent
is to fix our economy,

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:10.830
to get it creating jobs again,

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:14.900
and I think that a public
option will actually

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:18.696
hurt the economic
recovery and our long term

01:01:18.696 --> 01:01:22.930
fiscal situation because
it will end up causing

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:25.830
the government to raise taxes,
will probably raise premiums,

01:01:25.830 --> 01:01:28.730
or it will put us further into debt.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:31.390
I want to be able to say yes.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.493
There's so many good things we can do

01:01:33.493 --> 01:01:35.990
to make health insurance more affordable

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:39.275
and to extend it to people
who don't have it now,

01:01:39.275 --> 01:01:43.870
but I feel so strongly about the creation

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:48.155
of another government health
insurance entitlement,

01:01:48.155 --> 01:01:51.270
the government going into the
health insurance business.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:55.230
I think it's such a mistake
that I would use the power

01:01:55.230 --> 01:02:00.230
I have as a single Senator
to stop a final vote.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.130
- But what does that mean that
way that you might wind up

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:05.340
with nothing instead of something?

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:08.480
- Well, the truth is that
nothing is better than that

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:11.700
because I think we ought
to follow, if I may,

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.940
the doctor's oath here in Congress

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.740
as we deal with healthcare
reform: do no harm.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.764
- I'm gonna ask you this question because

01:02:18.764 --> 01:02:20.932
I want to give you a
chance to respond to it.

01:02:20.932 --> 01:02:25.080
Some of your critics say that
the reason that you are so

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.050
dead set against the
public option is because

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:29.920
there are so many insurance companies

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.120
headquartered in your
home state in Connecticut

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.170
and they've been some of
your biggest supporters.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.580
What have they giving
you this year, $400,000,

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:37.780
something like that?

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.380
Does that have anything
to do with your position

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.947
on the public option?

01:02:41.947 --> 01:02:42.965
- No.

01:02:42.965 --> 01:02:45.610
You know, I wish people
would come out and debate me

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:49.550
on the public option instead
of questioning my motives.

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:52.430
That's not the reason,
but I will say this:

01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:54.810
this recommendation of a public option,

01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.342
a government health insurance company,

01:02:57.342 --> 01:02:59.950
takes our government down a road

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:01.420
that we've never gone down before.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.581
In other words, we believe
in a market economy.

01:03:04.581 --> 01:03:07.642
It's what's created the
great American middle class,

01:03:07.642 --> 01:03:09.463
but it doesn't have a conscience.

01:03:09.463 --> 01:03:14.102
When it behaves badly, we
regulate companies, we sue them.

01:03:14.102 --> 01:03:16.308
I've been angry at oil companies.

01:03:16.308 --> 01:03:20.520
I never had the idea that the government

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:22.069
should go into the oil business

01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:24.510
to make oil companies behave better.

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:27.340
I think this would be a terrible mistake.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:32.340
- So, as you can see, that
is Lieberman making his case

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.670
as to why he's opposed
to the public option.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:39.139
Of course oil markets
are completely unlike

01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:42.489
health insurance markets
because they're not subject

01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:44.920
to the problems of adverse selection

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.126
that we discussed earlier,
where the people who,

01:03:48.126 --> 01:03:52.017
if you don't have a universal system,

01:03:52.017 --> 01:03:56.480
the people that most need
the insurance are going to be

01:03:56.480 --> 01:04:00.110
the ones that the company's
gonna least want to insure,

01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:04.610
and so it's not a very
convincing argument.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:07.926
However, it was it was a political winner,

01:04:07.926 --> 01:04:11.220
and 10 days before the
bill was going to go

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:14.479
through the Senate, he was the 60th vote,

01:04:14.479 --> 01:04:17.900
and he insisted that
unless the public option

01:04:17.900 --> 01:04:20.520
was taken out of the bill,
he would not vote for it,

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:22.488
and so it was taken out of the bill.

01:04:22.488 --> 01:04:27.488
And so, having made the decision
not to take on Big Pharma

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:34.130
over prices because of the
difficulty of fighting two wars

01:04:35.881 --> 01:04:39.140
at the same time, they didn't in the end

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:42.180
get the universal coverage either.

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:47.180
And so you can see the
pathologies of the American system

01:04:47.437 --> 01:04:50.683
playing themselves out with this.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.332
What happened subsequently with Obamacare?

01:04:54.332 --> 01:04:57.245
Well, it was challenged in the courts

01:04:57.245 --> 01:05:02.211
and finally made its way
to the Supreme Court,

01:05:02.211 --> 01:05:04.500
and many people thought that the court

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:08.162
was going to strike down the entire bill,

01:05:08.162 --> 01:05:13.162
particularly because
of some drafting errors

01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:18.275
in provisions about
the individual mandate.

01:05:18.275 --> 01:05:22.880
And there were two surprises
in the Supreme Court's decision

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:26.107
written by John Roberts in NFIB.

01:05:26.107 --> 01:05:28.040
I should say that NFIB is

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:30.890
the National Federation
of Independent Businesses,

01:05:30.890 --> 01:05:34.640
and they tend to represent
to represent small business

01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:37.691
rather than big business and
they're very conservative

01:05:37.691 --> 01:05:42.443
and very opposed to healthcare insurance,

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.529
and so they brought this case.

01:05:47.529 --> 01:05:52.529
And so, Roberts, and this was the surprise

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:57.365
that gets a lot of press,
said well actually,

01:05:57.365 --> 01:06:02.365
the individual mandate, which requires you

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:05.810
to have insurance, so to
get around the problem

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:10.550
of adverse selection, or pay a penalty,

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.652
that that penalty was a tax.

01:06:12.652 --> 01:06:16.998
And so it was the taxing power
of the federal government

01:06:16.998 --> 01:06:19.064
saved Obamacare.

01:06:19.064 --> 01:06:23.320
But a different feature,
and in another surprise,

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.060
it's a great surprise to everybody

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:29.108
in the healthcare industry
and people who study this

01:06:29.108 --> 01:06:33.349
was that there had been another
provision in the Obama bill

01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:37.736
to try and move it toward
more universal coverage

01:06:37.736 --> 01:06:41.524
with respect to Medicaid
coverage for poor people,

01:06:41.524 --> 01:06:46.524
which is that they gave a lot
of funds to expand Medicaid

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.200
in the states to improve it,
to get away from the niggardly

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:54.602
system of block grants that
diminished Medicaid funding

01:06:54.602 --> 01:06:59.602
over such a long period of
time, and what they did,

01:06:59.929 --> 01:07:02.970
almost all of the money
for this was coming

01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:05.390
from the federal government,
so states would not have

01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:08.920
to raise taxes, but they also conditioned

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.970
all their Medicaid funding,
all of the federal government's

01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:14.530
Medicaid funding, on signing up for this.

01:07:14.530 --> 01:07:17.061
And of course, many of the
states had conservative

01:07:17.061 --> 01:07:20.579
Republican legislatures or
governors who didn't want

01:07:20.579 --> 01:07:25.579
to expand Medicaid, and so,
they were, they were arguing

01:07:26.514 --> 01:07:31.160
that this was this was an unfair coercion

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.098
and the court bought this argument.

01:07:34.098 --> 01:07:39.098
And so this, in effect, while
it it saved part of Obamacare,

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:44.450
it saved the individual
mandate, it made it impossible

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:48.276
for the federal government
to force the states,

01:07:48.276 --> 01:07:53.130
to even condition the
federal aid to the states

01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:56.130
on their expansion of Medicaid.

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:59.256
And so, that greatly reduced the reach

01:07:59.256 --> 01:08:02.144
and reduced the expansion of coverage

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:07.144
that Obamacare would have
provided to poor people.

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:11.899
And playing out the
path dependency in 2017,

01:08:11.899 --> 01:08:15.351
when the Trump administration
comes into office,

01:08:15.351 --> 01:08:19.090
because the individual
mandate has now been declared

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:22.138
to be a tax, they could
repeal it as part of

01:08:22.138 --> 01:08:26.030
the 2017 tax law, for which
they only needed 50 votes

01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.600
because it was going through

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.796
as part of the budget reconciliation,

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:33.228
so which they duly did.

01:08:33.228 --> 01:08:36.667
And so the individual mandate

01:08:36.667 --> 01:08:40.173
was taken out of the
bill and that, of course,

01:08:40.173 --> 01:08:45.173
is the stop gap against the
unraveling of insurance markets

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.585
in the face of the
adverse selection problem,

01:08:48.585 --> 01:08:53.585
and they've also damaged it in other ways

01:08:53.752 --> 01:08:55.960
that are being fought out in the courts

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.390
by allowing consortiums
of small businesses

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:02.550
to clump together to buy
insurance, which would again

01:09:04.095 --> 01:09:08.916
enable better heeled groups
to bail out of the system

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:13.300
and leaving less well heeled groups in it.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:17.370
Again, another version
of the Hirschman problem.

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.550
So what might be done?

01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:23.185
So one one argument that we propose

01:09:23.185 --> 01:09:28.185
in "The Wolf at the Door" is
to think of bottom up Medicare

01:09:30.190 --> 01:09:33.721
expansion and what what we,
the idea here is the following:

01:09:33.721 --> 01:09:38.721
that currently, most people
can cover their children

01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:44.680
up to age 26 on their health insurance.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.028
This is through existing regulation.

01:09:48.028 --> 01:09:53.028
If you said that people in
year one from age 26 to 30,

01:09:55.973 --> 01:10:00.973
could buy Medicare, this
would be quite cheap,

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.890
because it's not young
people who get sick,

01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:06.220
it's old people who get sick, right?

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:11.220
And so you could move towards
Medicare For All step by step,

01:10:12.749 --> 01:10:16.300
but if you started with the younger people

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.674
and then they could keep it
as they as they grew older,

01:10:20.674 --> 01:10:24.683
it would take, you know,
it would take a generation

01:10:24.683 --> 01:10:27.440
to achieve that gain.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.810
But eventually, but you
would be getting there,

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:33.973
and it secondly takes
account one of the problems,

01:10:33.973 --> 01:10:36.960
one of the things that all
of the Democratic candidates

01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:39.150
are running into, well certainly the ones

01:10:39.150 --> 01:10:43.101
on the left of the party,
is that most people,

01:10:43.101 --> 01:10:46.870
it's said over and over
again 190 million people

01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:50.560
have health insurance from their employers

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.454
and they're satisfied with it.

01:10:52.454 --> 01:10:55.192
So, but two things are
happening over time.

01:10:55.192 --> 01:10:57.830
One is they're getting
less satisfied with it

01:10:57.830 --> 01:11:00.550
because the cost to
employers are going up,

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:03.812
and so they're getting less
and less generous plans,

01:11:03.812 --> 01:11:07.160
or they're, like, you
know, just as at Yale now,

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:10.230
or you can get the health
plan or you can get ETDA

01:11:10.230 --> 01:11:12.010
and then you can get
a more expensive ETDA.

01:11:12.010 --> 01:11:14.550
They're creating tiered systems.

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:18.470
But more and more people are
finding that the coverage

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:21.050
they're getting from their
employers isn't that great.

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:24.280
And then secondly, think
about what we've talked about

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.480
over the course of the last few weeks.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.120
More and more people are
going to be losing their jobs

01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:32.615
over and over again over
the course of their careers.

01:11:32.615 --> 01:11:37.230
So even if they have

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:39.420
employer-based healthcare,

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:41.875
they're probably not going
to be able to keep it.

01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:45.930
And every time they change jobs,
the question is going to be

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.750
well, what kind of health benefits come?

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:50.888
And so many of those
people who might today

01:11:50.888 --> 01:11:55.710
not think there's anything wrong
with their health insurance

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:57.654
that the government should be fixing

01:11:57.654 --> 01:12:00.965
might start to have a very
different view over time,

01:12:00.965 --> 01:12:05.820
given the fiscal pressures on
firms to reduce these costs,

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:10.120
and the fact that people are
going to be changing employment

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.985
and might have to go from
a job that has coverage

01:12:12.985 --> 01:12:15.180
to a job that hasn't got coverage,

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.185
or at least might have no coverage

01:12:17.185 --> 01:12:20.064
while they're looking for another job.

01:12:20.064 --> 01:12:24.760
And so even though
current polling suggests

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.730
most people are satisfied with
their employer-based policies

01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:32.548
that number is likely to
change, and if you had

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:36.874
a way of voluntarily buying into Medicare,

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:39.710
the group for that would grow.

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:43.520
And then of course, this
builds the political coalition

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:47.243
over time, because you
have more and more people

01:12:47.243 --> 01:12:51.124
in the coalition who
want to be able to keep

01:12:51.124 --> 01:12:55.271
what they're getting, and so
this is the kind of policy

01:12:55.271 --> 01:13:00.271
that we argue can work its way
through our building blocks

01:13:00.770 --> 01:13:03.237
of distributed politics
and actually become

01:13:03.237 --> 01:13:08.043
a credible political,
a viable political path

01:13:08.043 --> 01:13:13.043
to a serviceable policy.

01:13:13.385 --> 01:13:18.385
And so, it's a, as I
say, we didn't have much

01:13:18.901 --> 01:13:23.598
of a positive thing to say
about K through 12 education,

01:13:23.598 --> 01:13:26.600
but this is a kind of path forward

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:30.020
which wouldn't have the
sort of sticker shock

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.450
that Medicare For All has today,

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:38.384
and if you think about it
as a 10 or 15 year project,

01:13:38.384 --> 01:13:43.384
actually has a chance of
viability as a proposal

01:13:44.575 --> 01:13:46.554
for which support can be built.

01:13:46.554 --> 01:13:50.630
Okay, we will talk about
proposals for political reform

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:52.793
in the final lecture on Thursday.

01:13:56.183 --> 01:13:58.766

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.029
Prof: Okay,
so last time we saw the

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:07.340
jeopardy approach to solving the
Schrödinger equation,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.180
which is to take the answer and
find out what the problem was,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.610
and we saw that for a constant
potential you got a sine wave.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.848
You could choose any length of
sine wave you wanted,

00:00:17.848 --> 00:00:19.690
any wave period you wanted.
 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.475
It just turned out to be
different energies and it had a

00:00:22.475 --> 00:00:25.210
relationship between the
wavelength and the energy,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.961
the kinetic energy,
or the total energy in that

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:28.380
case.
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.530
And we saw an exponential is --
corresponds to --

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.129
negative kinetic energy,
which not very many people in

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.539
the class liked,
and not very many people ever

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.945
like it,
but suck it up because that's

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:47.660
the way kinetic energy is for
small particles.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.710
If you don't like to call it
kinetic energy because you're so

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.760
wedded to the fact that for big
things it's ½mv^2,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.396
then just consider it the
difference between total energy

00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:00.890
and potential energy.
 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.049
Okay?
 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.930
But anyhow it's kinetic energy.
 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.668
Okay, so we looked at the
jeopardy approach,

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:08.610
to start with the answer and
get the question.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.027
But we'd a lot rather do it the
other direction,

00:01:12.027 --> 00:01:16.390
to start with the problem and
find out what the answer is.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.450
And you can do that by guessing
the energy.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.599
If you have a sufficiently
simple system,

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:25.830
that is, one particle in one
dimension;

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.676
and this is a great way to get
the idea of what's special about

00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:31.647
quantum mechanics,
make it as simple as possible

00:01:31.647 --> 00:01:34.420
and then we'll go to realistic
systems.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.190
Okay, so we can rearrange the
Schrödinger equation.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.949
Remember, this is the
Schrödinger equation:

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:43.411
HΨ=EΨ;
divide through by Ψ

00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:46.367
and split the
HΨ/Ψ part into

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:50.492
the potential energy part,
V, which is a nothing,

00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:54.315
it's given to you,
and the kinetic energy part,

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:59.360
which is a negative constant
that involves the inverse mass

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.709
times the curvature of Ψ
over Ψ.

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.790
So it has to do with the
shape of Ψ.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.625
And remember,
if you multiply Ψ by

00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:10.830
a constant,
you multiply the curvature by

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.867
the same constant,
so the kinetic energy stays the

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:14.240
same.
 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.990
So it's only what we say,
the shape, not really the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.889
amplitude, because that scales
with the curvature.

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:26.688
Okay, but now we can rearrange
this, this way.

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:33.490
So we have a formula here for
the curvature of Ψ.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.878
Now if you have a formula for
the curvature,

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:41.050
if you know how a curve is
going to change,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.128
how a line is going to change
its curvature ,

00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:47.430
then you have a recipe for
drawing it,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.740
if you know how to start.
 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.660
If you start with a certain
height,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.288
and a certain slope -- suppose
you know that,

00:02:56.288 --> 00:03:00.568
and you know the curvature,
at that point,

00:03:00.568 --> 00:03:04.574
then you know if you take a
little step in that direction

00:03:04.574 --> 00:03:07.219
what the next slope is going to
be.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:07.830
Okay?
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.658
Because that's how curved it is.
 

00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:13.310
And if you recalculate and know
the curvature at that point,

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.451
then you know what the
curvature at the next point is

00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:16.808
going to be,
and the next and the next and

00:03:16.808 --> 00:03:19.230
the next,
and you can use this to just

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.514
draw a curve that's bound to
satisfy the Schrödinger

00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:28.179
equation because you're using
the Schrödinger equation to

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:29.479
generate it.
 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.479
Does everybody see this?
 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.568
This is really important.
 

00:03:32.568 --> 00:03:35.628
Do you want me to say it again,
or you got it now?

00:03:35.628 --> 00:03:38.400
If you have a formula for the
curvature --

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.419
that's how fast the slope is
changing --

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:45.889
and if you know the initial
height and the initial slope,

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.405
then if you know the direction
of the slope you know where the

00:03:48.405 --> 00:03:49.560
next point is going to be.
 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.330
So you go to that -- just think
a tiny -- now this gets a

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.520
problem in a computer.
 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.669
If the thing is really going
like this and you take a finite

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.680
step, the slope will have
changed during your step and you

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.650
won't get it just right.
 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.950
So you'll have to take smaller
and smaller steps so that it

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.830
doesn't change during the step.
 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.538
Chenyu?
 

00:04:09.538 --> 00:04:11.370
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.460
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.092
Student:  Are you saying
that the curvature is a second

00:04:14.092 --> 00:04:14.438
derivative?
 

00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:16.680
Prof: Yes,
the curvature is a second

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.639
derivative, yes.
 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.639
Student:  How do we
start with the correct slope?

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.319
Prof: We'll get to that.
 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.442
But if you have the initial
slope, and the initial height,

00:04:24.442 --> 00:04:27.622
then you use the formula for
the curvature to trace out the

00:04:27.622 --> 00:04:28.170
curve.
 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.110
Everybody got that now?
 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.894
Okay, so that's great,
and it would be tedious to do

00:04:35.894 --> 00:04:38.833
this by hand,
but that's what this little

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:41.333
program,
Erwin Meets Goldilocks,

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:44.250
does is start the curve and
draw it out,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.714
according to what -- if you
know everything else in the

00:04:47.714 --> 00:04:48.420
equation.
 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.084
Okay, so, and remember it
curves away from zero when the

00:04:53.084 --> 00:04:57.579
potential energy is greater than
the total energy,

00:04:57.579 --> 00:05:02.096
and it curves towards zero when
the potential energy is less

00:05:02.096 --> 00:05:03.781
than the total energy.
 

00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:04.470
Right?
 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.899
So the potential energy being
greater than the total energy is

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:12.252
a bad situation intuitively,
right, it means the kinetic

00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:14.540
energy is negative,
and it curves away from the

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:15.069
baseline.
 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.550
And what's bad about that,
or dangerous about that?

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.350
Yes, Kevin?
 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.509
Pardon me?
 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:22.000
Student:  It's not
bounded.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.610
Prof: Yes,
it'll keep going until it gets

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.610
to infinity, if it's curving
away.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.019
Okay, and that's not allowed,
it has to not go to infinity.

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:33.240
Okay, so now do we know
everything else?

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.379
Well we know m, the mass.
 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:38.297
We know the constant,
C, and the V is

00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:41.505
given to us, the potential
energy changes with position.

00:05:41.505 --> 00:05:42.089
Right?
 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.730
But we know how it changes with
position;

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.851
it's Coulomb's law typically,
or we can do some other law if

00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:48.540
we want to.
 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.704
So this recipe then,
you know everything on the

00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:57.410
right, except the total energy.
 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.456
Ψ you don't care
about because you can scale it,

00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:03.029
you can make it anything you
want, call it one.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.379
Okay?
 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.310
Then we can double it if we
want to or whatever.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.540
So Ψ we know;
m we know;

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.439
C we know;
V we know.

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.040
We're going to guess E.
 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.670
So that means if we know the
initial slope --

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.620
and for the problems we work on
the initial slope will be zero,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.785
and you'll see why -- then we
can use this formula to trace

00:06:24.785 --> 00:06:26.209
out the curve.
 

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:26.850
Okay?
 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.310
And that's what the computer
does for you.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.410
So people were worried last
night about math.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.310
Don't worry about math.
 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.074
Let the computer calculate how
these slopes change and so on.

00:06:38.074 --> 00:06:38.709
Right?
 

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:41.569
All you have to do is think
about the curvature.

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:43.290
Okay?
 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.410
So you just have to think about
the graph.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.624
Okay, so we're going to talk
now about nodes and

00:06:48.624 --> 00:06:50.675
quantization,
in one dimension,

00:06:50.675 --> 00:06:54.300
using this program Erwin
Meets Goldilocks.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.389
And there's a problem set for
Monday,

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.434
as you know,
where you do this,

00:06:58.434 --> 00:07:00.819
and the answers are on the
Wiki,

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:03.709
but don't look at them before
you've given it a good try.

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:07.923
Okay, so let's -- there are
simpler things to start with,

00:07:07.923 --> 00:07:12.213
like a constant potential
energy or running into a wall or

00:07:12.213 --> 00:07:14.319
into a pillow more like.
 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:18.889
But the harmonic oscillator,
or Hooke's law,

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:23.569
is a very popular one to do;
so we're going to do that.

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.946
Okay, so here we're looking at
the potential energy as a

00:07:25.946 --> 00:07:26.939
function of distance.
 

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:30.673
And also on the -- so you see
the distance goes from zero to

00:07:30.673 --> 00:07:34.661
two and a half angstroms and the
potential energy goes from zero

00:07:34.661 --> 00:07:36.750
to 100 kilocalories per mole.
 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.040
You can change that if you want
to on the computer.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.949
Okay?
 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:46.290
And the horizontal black line
is a completely different plot.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.050
It's a plot of Ψ.
 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:51.764
That's the plot on top of this
one where we're going to trace

00:07:51.764 --> 00:07:53.190
out the wavefunction.
 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.720
Okay?
 

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.230
And that's zero of the
wavefunction;

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.709
here's zero of energy.
 

00:07:58.709 --> 00:07:59.990
Okay?
 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.583
And the reason we put them on
top of one another is so that

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:06.930
it's easy to see the influence
of one on the other,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.490
of the wavefunction on the
potential energy and vice-versa,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.189
and because they're functions
of the same thing.

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:16.180
What's Ψ a function
of?

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.579
What's it a function of?
 

00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:19.829
Students:  Position.
 

00:08:19.829 --> 00:08:21.759
Prof: It's a function of
the position.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:23.879
Position of what?
 

00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.910
The one particle we're talking
about.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.189
Okay?
 

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:29.740
And the potential energy is
also a function of the position.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:35.330
Okay, so the way we're going to
do this then is to guess an

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.668
energy, let the computer trace
out this curve,

00:08:39.668 --> 00:08:42.558
and see whether it's okay.
 

00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:45.100
What will tell us whether it's
okay?

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.879
How will we know if it's okay?
 

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:51.658
It's got to be continuous.
 

00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:53.620
We're not going to have a
problem with that because the

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.000
computer is tracing it out this
way;

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.980
it's not going to be
discontinuous.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.596
But the main thing is that it
doesn't diverge,

00:09:00.596 --> 00:09:03.250
that it doesn't go to infinity.
 

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:08.129
Okay, so let's just guess
twenty-one kcal/mole.

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:09.190
Why not?
 

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.871
Okay, now you can already tell
me something about what the

00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:14.808
curve is going to look like.
 

00:09:14.808 --> 00:09:19.230
Notice that at those two
distances, between these two

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.903
distances, the total energy is
higher than the potential

00:09:23.903 --> 00:09:24.840
energy.
 

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:29.788
What's the curve going to look
like in that region?

00:09:29.788 --> 00:09:32.899
The kinetic energy is going to
be positive, right?

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:38.200
What will the curve look like?
 

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.408
Pat?
 

00:09:39.408 --> 00:09:40.970
Student:  Spike up in
between them.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:41.580
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.009
Student:  It's going to
spike up in between those two

00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:44.340
lines.
 

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.539
Prof: It may go up,
it may go down.

00:09:47.539 --> 00:09:48.379
Yes?
 

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:50.610
Pardon me?
 

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.610
It's not -- would it be a sine
curve?

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.210
Does anybody think it wouldn't
be a sine curve?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.009
Why not Russell?
 

00:09:57.009 --> 00:09:59.472
Student:  It does
sinusoidal behavior when the

00:09:59.472 --> 00:10:00.610
potential is constant.
 

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.750
Prof: That's when the
potential is constant.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:05.311
It's not constant through here.
 

00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:05.889
Right?
 

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:09.028
So it won't be an exact sine
curve.

00:10:09.028 --> 00:10:12.346
If this isn't very high,
it might be close to a sine

00:10:12.346 --> 00:10:14.883
curve because it's sort of
constant-ish,

00:10:14.883 --> 00:10:17.288
if this is a very small
distance.

00:10:17.288 --> 00:10:21.139
But what characteristic must it
have?

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:22.759
Student:  It'll curve
towards zero.

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:23.460
Prof: Say it again.
 

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.308
Student:  It'll curve
towards zero.

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:26.970
Prof: It'll curve
towards zero.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.490
So it might -- it'll look
something like this.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.851
Always -- it's curving and
going up and down,

00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:34.322
maybe going high,
but it's always curving to go

00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:35.879
back toward the baseline.
 

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:38.070
It's never going to go to
infinity.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.168
Okay?
 

00:10:39.168 --> 00:10:43.081
Now, there's a problem,
because if you go the other

00:10:43.081 --> 00:10:45.072
way,
the rest of the graph,

00:10:45.072 --> 00:10:49.009
the kinetic energy is negative
because the potential's higher

00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:50.190
than the total.
 

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.912
So in that region there's great
danger that the line is going to

00:10:54.912 --> 00:10:57.836
go to infinity,
because it's going to be

00:10:57.836 --> 00:11:00.460
curving away from the baseline.
 

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.889
Okay?
 

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:05.190
Now how could you possibly
avoid that?

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.947
How could you have it such that
the curvature divided by the

00:11:09.947 --> 00:11:14.865
value of the wavefunction gets
very big and the curvature away

00:11:14.865 --> 00:11:18.611
from the baseline,
but still it doesn't go to

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:19.340
infinity?
 

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.405
How can the kinetic energy be
big and negative,

00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:27.472
the curvature divided by the
value is enormous,

00:11:27.472 --> 00:11:30.480
but it doesn't go to infinity?
 

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.379
How can that be?
 

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:35.409
Student:  Do we have to
bound it?

00:11:35.409 --> 00:11:36.019
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:37.149
Student:  Bound.
 

00:11:37.149 --> 00:11:37.908
Prof: Bound?
 

00:11:37.908 --> 00:11:40.279
Student:  Yeah bound
what we're looking at?

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:43.779
Prof: No,
it's not a question of bound.

00:11:43.779 --> 00:11:45.799
This thing is,
the particle,

00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:50.214
if it has this total energy,
is bounded, it can't go all the

00:11:50.214 --> 00:11:54.178
way to the left or the right,
that's true enough.

00:11:54.178 --> 00:12:00.596
Okay, but that's not the secret
of how the wavefunction avoids

00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:02.700
going to infinity.
 

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.340
Yeah?
 

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.279
Student:  Make it a
constant.

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:05.950
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.129
Student:  Make it a
constant.

00:12:08.129 --> 00:12:11.070
Prof: We can't -- make
what a constant?

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:16.179
Student:  Like --
another one a little bit.

00:12:16.179 --> 00:12:17.820
Prof: Okay.
 

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:18.740
Russell?
 

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:20.418
Student:  You'd have
very little curvature.

00:12:20.418 --> 00:12:22.950
Prof: But -- you say
very little curvature.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.460
But the kinetic energy is
enormous.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:33.972
The curvature divided by the
value of the wavefunction has to

00:12:33.972 --> 00:12:35.960
be enormous.
 

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.649
Mike?
 

00:12:36.649 --> 00:12:39.509
Student:  You could make
the value of the wave function

00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:40.120
go to zero.
 

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.847
Prof: Ah,
if the value of the

00:12:41.847 --> 00:12:45.542
wavefunction is almost zero,
then you can have an enormous

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:48.174
-- pardon me,
wait a minute -- then you can

00:12:48.174 --> 00:12:51.908
have a tiny numerator,
hardly any curvature at all,

00:12:51.908 --> 00:12:54.667
and still the quotient can be
big.

00:12:54.667 --> 00:12:55.418
Right?
 

00:12:55.418 --> 00:13:00.535
The kinetic energy can be
enormous, and negative,

00:13:00.535 --> 00:13:04.158
if the denominator is near
zero.

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:07.034
So that means that if you're in
those red regions,

00:13:07.034 --> 00:13:09.970
you know what the wavefunction
has to look like.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.528
What does it have to look like?
 

00:13:12.528 --> 00:13:15.726
It has to get down near zero
and stay there so that it

00:13:15.726 --> 00:13:19.104
doesn't have the curvature
that'll -- enough curvature to

00:13:19.104 --> 00:13:20.129
pull it away.
 

00:13:20.129 --> 00:13:23.102
So it's got to look like that,
on the left.

00:13:23.102 --> 00:13:23.668
Right?
 

00:13:23.668 --> 00:13:26.720
Because out here,
that parabola is going way up;

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.989
it's enormous,
curvature divided by

00:13:28.989 --> 00:13:31.592
wavefunction,
but if the wavefunction is

00:13:31.592 --> 00:13:34.464
essentially zero,
still the curvature can be

00:13:34.464 --> 00:13:36.000
essentially zero.
 

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.429
Okay?
 

00:13:37.429 --> 00:13:39.158
And the same on the right.
 

00:13:39.158 --> 00:13:41.976
So we know that the curve is
going to look like this,

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:43.169
something like that.
 

00:13:43.169 --> 00:13:44.360
Okay?
 

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.730
And all we have to do is
connect the pieces.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.000
Okay, so let's try it.
 

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.158
We guessed twenty-one kcal/mole.
 

00:13:51.158 --> 00:13:54.538
This we did in our head,
just by thinking about it.

00:13:54.538 --> 00:13:58.120
But let's let the program do
it, and start at the left.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:06.080
And now do you see why it has
to start with zero slope?

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.149
Because if it's out in this
region and has a finite slope,

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:14.149
or an appreciable slope,
and it's curving away,

00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:17.171
you're in trouble,
because it's going to go to

00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:17.908
infinity.
 

00:14:17.908 --> 00:14:21.730
So we're going to use Erwin
Meets Goldilocks,

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:23.668
this program,
and we're going to start at --

00:14:23.668 --> 00:14:26.668
here goes the curve,
and there's the part where the

00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:28.830
kinetic energy is negative,
right?

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.618
It hasn't gone to infinity
because it started low enough

00:14:32.618 --> 00:14:35.649
and with low enough slope out at
the left.

00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:38.893
Okay, now what's going to
happen when it crosses that

00:14:38.893 --> 00:14:39.330
line?
 

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:42.759
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:43.230
Prof: What?
 

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.048
Student:  The curvature
changes.

00:14:44.048 --> 00:14:46.272
Student:  Now the
curvature is going to be toward

00:14:46.272 --> 00:14:47.970
the baseline,
as we guessed it would be;

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.769
so like that.
 

00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:54.678
And now what's going to happen?
 

00:14:54.678 --> 00:15:00.308
Now it's going to start curving
away from the baseline again.

00:15:00.308 --> 00:15:05.889
Uh oh, you don't win them all,
right?

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:11.990
Okay, now did we have too much
energy or too little energy

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.740
here?
 

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:18.178
Notice that -- what did we want
it to do on the right?

00:15:18.178 --> 00:15:20.613
On the left is where we
started, that looks great,

00:15:20.613 --> 00:15:22.600
but on the right we're having
trouble.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.072
What do you need to do in the
middle in order for it to behave

00:15:27.072 --> 00:15:28.538
okay on the right?
 

00:15:28.538 --> 00:15:32.548
It has to not curve so much
toward the baseline.

00:15:32.548 --> 00:15:34.009
Does everybody see what I'm
saying?

00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:37.541
If it curved less,
then it could join that other

00:15:37.541 --> 00:15:39.418
line we had originally.
 

00:15:39.418 --> 00:15:41.600
Okay, so we'll give it a little
less energy.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.059
Let's try twenty.
 

00:15:43.059 --> 00:15:47.269
That's too hot, too much energy.
 

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:49.720
Okay, so we'll guess twenty
kcal/mole.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.759
Okay, here we go.
 

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.744
Start out;
almost exactly the same,

00:15:52.744 --> 00:15:55.485
it's nearly the same energy,
so it doesn't surprise you that

00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:56.740
it looks about the same.
 

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.495
And then it's going to curve in
here, the way we expected,

00:16:00.495 --> 00:16:03.130
but a little bit less than it
did before.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:03.788
Right?
 

00:16:03.788 --> 00:16:11.620
So now we're on the way to
success.

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.190
So what was that one?
 

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.750
Student:  Too cold.
 

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.500
Prof: Too cold.
 

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.220
And what do you need?
 

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.788
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:16:19.788 --> 00:16:22.565
Prof: Someplace in
between these,

00:16:22.565 --> 00:16:25.340
there's going to be one that's
right.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.899
Okay?
 

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:30.168
So it's between twenty and
twenty-one.

00:16:30.168 --> 00:16:36.197
Now should we guess halfway
between twenty and twenty-one,

00:16:36.197 --> 00:16:40.110
is that the reasonable thing to
do?

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:45.730
Which original guess was better?
 

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:52.279
Which guess was better
originally, and why?

00:16:52.279 --> 00:16:54.720
The red one or the blue one,
which guess was better?

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.629
Student:  The red one.
 

00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:57.210
Prof: Why was the red
one better?

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.860
Student:  Because it
curved close to the baseline.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.220
Prof: It lasted longer
before it went to infinity.

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.170
So it'll be closer to the red
than to the blue.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.390
And if you fiddle around -- and
that's what I want you to do,

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.103
because this is the way I think
it gets into your head is by

00:17:10.103 --> 00:17:12.678
guessing numbers and saying
"where should I make the

00:17:12.678 --> 00:17:13.460
next guess?"
 

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.150
and so on.
 

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.838
After you've done this a
certain number of times --

00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:20.721
but enough times that it really
gets into your bones and your

00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:22.180
brain --
after you've done it enough

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.075
times,
then you can use the function

00:17:24.075 --> 00:17:27.215
that says "Solve"
and it will do that guessing

00:17:27.215 --> 00:17:28.130
game for you.
 

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.338
But do it yourself at the
beginning.

00:17:30.338 --> 00:17:33.220
Okay, and it turns out that
after you've done that,

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.670
you get 20.74 da-da-da-da-da,
like a lot of decimal points,

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.789
decimal positions,
and you get that one,

00:17:41.789 --> 00:17:43.809
just right.
 

00:17:43.809 --> 00:17:44.450
Okay?
 

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.519
So that's the only math you
need to do.

00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:51.480
Is it too hot or too cold or
just right?

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.029
Okay?
 

00:17:52.029 --> 00:17:54.984
And you have to know why it has
to be that way,

00:17:54.984 --> 00:17:57.170
because of this curvature
thing.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:01.236
Okay, so there we have it,
20.74 kcal/mole is a

00:18:01.236 --> 00:18:04.948
satisfactory energy,
and it comes with this

00:18:04.948 --> 00:18:08.750
wavefunction,
whatever that's good for.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:09.358
Okay?
 

00:18:09.358 --> 00:18:12.247
But the energy is what we were
looking at, what energies are

00:18:12.247 --> 00:18:13.519
allowed for this system?
 

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:17.798
Now, could there be a lower
energy allowed for this system?

00:18:17.798 --> 00:18:23.806
Could you imagine a less curved
wavefunction that would also

00:18:23.806 --> 00:18:28.490
have this property of not going
to infinity?

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.990
Can somebody guess what it
would look like?

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.750
Nick?
 

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.019
Student:  You'd have one
that would just go up.

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:36.701
Prof: Ah,
it could just go up and then

00:18:36.701 --> 00:18:39.753
come back to the baseline --
it has to come back to the

00:18:39.753 --> 00:18:41.997
baseline --
but it could just go up rather

00:18:41.997 --> 00:18:44.009
than curving so much in the
middle.

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:45.608
Okay, so we guess a lower one.
 

00:18:45.608 --> 00:18:48.390
Could there be a lower energy
Ψ?

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.826
Yes indeed, there could be one
at 4.15 -- it's actually

00:18:51.826 --> 00:18:55.390
.149-something-or-another,
to a lot of decimal points.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:59.380
And there it is,
exactly what Nick expected.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.940
Okay, so you got this.
 

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:05.269
Could there be a still lower
one?

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.068
Student:  Yes,
well in between the two.

00:19:06.068 --> 00:19:07.940
Prof: Not in between.
 

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:10.480
Can there be one lower than the
blue?

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.750
Student:
&gt;

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.137
Prof: Can you imagine a
way to get it even lower than

00:19:18.137 --> 00:19:21.009
the blue, an even lower
curvature than the blue?

00:19:21.009 --> 00:19:22.319
Yes, Angela?
 

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:23.220
Pardon me?
 

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.788
Student:  What if it
curved, like the one --

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:26.348
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:19:26.348 --> 00:19:28.559
Student:  If the blue
one is going up,

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.420
then there could be one going
down.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.869
Prof: Ah,
there could be an upside-down

00:19:32.869 --> 00:19:34.605
blue one;
absolutely true,

00:19:34.605 --> 00:19:38.579
there could be an upside-down
blue one, but it's the same

00:19:38.579 --> 00:19:42.838
thing, because it's the blue one
multiplied by minus one.

00:19:42.838 --> 00:19:45.950
Remember, you can multiply it
by any number and it's still the

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:46.510
same thing.
 

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:46.970
Right?
 

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:48.118
So it's exactly the same energy.
 

00:19:48.118 --> 00:19:49.883
It's not a different
wavefunction,

00:19:49.883 --> 00:19:51.858
it's just multiplied by a
constant.

00:19:51.858 --> 00:19:53.970
But you're right,
that also does the trick,

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.980
but it turns out to be the same
thing.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.740
Can you imagine anything lower
in energy than this?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.458
It's impossible,
because if it had less

00:20:02.458 --> 00:20:06.176
curvature in the middle,
it's bound to go to infinity

00:20:06.176 --> 00:20:09.108
when it got back in the other
region.

00:20:09.108 --> 00:20:11.778
Okay, so that's -- the blue is
the lowest one.

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:14.420
Now could there be one in
between these two?

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:15.640
Student:  Yes.
 

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.509
Prof: How?
 

00:20:16.509 --> 00:20:20.240
It looks like -- how could you
do it?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.858
Yes, Kevin?
 

00:20:21.858 --> 00:20:24.890
Student:  One peak is
above the value and one peak --

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.978
Prof: Ah,
one peak above and one below.

00:20:26.978 --> 00:20:27.348
Right?
 

00:20:27.348 --> 00:20:29.380
Could there be an energy in
between?

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.358
Yes indeed, there could be that
one.

00:20:33.358 --> 00:20:41.358
Now could there be others in
between?

00:20:41.358 --> 00:20:44.809
What happens as you add
curvature?

00:20:44.809 --> 00:20:46.960
You have these nodes.
 

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.220
A node is where the
wavefunction is zero.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.410
It's not a node out here,
where it's almost zero.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.156
A node is when it's exactly
zero, and it has to be zero

00:20:57.156 --> 00:21:00.160
because it's going from being
positive to being negative;

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.130
obviously it has to go through
zero.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.686
Out here, and out there,
it's very, very,

00:21:04.686 --> 00:21:08.038
very small but it's not zero;
that's not a node.

00:21:08.038 --> 00:21:11.670
A node is where it's zero
because it's changing sign.

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.109
Okay, now nodes are related to
energy.

00:21:15.109 --> 00:21:17.180
Why?
 

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.909
Notice that the lowest energy
one, blue, had no node,

00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:23.848
the next one,
the purple, had one node.

00:21:23.848 --> 00:21:27.603
The next one,
the violet or whatever color it

00:21:27.603 --> 00:21:29.309
is, had two nodes.
 

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:31.519
Why is there that relationship?
 

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:34.180
Student:  I was noticing
inflection points.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.103
Prof: They are
inflection points,

00:21:36.103 --> 00:21:39.259
but why do they get higher in
energy when you have more nodes?

00:21:39.259 --> 00:21:40.130
Sam?
 

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.618
Student:  Higher
frequency.

00:21:43.618 --> 00:21:47.460
Prof: Say it in terms of
energy.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:51.089
Some people would say frequency
is energy, that's true,

00:21:51.089 --> 00:21:54.990
but I want you to say it terms
we've been talking about.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.740
How do you get more nodes?
 

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.259
Yeah?
 

00:21:57.259 --> 00:22:00.490
Student:  A higher
absolute value of curvature.

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:03.780
Prof: Yes,
if the curvature gets bigger,

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.143
you get more nodes,
and curvature is the energy,

00:22:07.143 --> 00:22:08.502
the kinetic energy.
 

00:22:08.502 --> 00:22:09.288
Right?
 

00:22:09.288 --> 00:22:13.098
So more curvature,
more nodes, more energy;

00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:16.224
or more energy,
more curvature,

00:22:16.224 --> 00:22:17.578
more nodes.
 

00:22:17.578 --> 00:22:20.900
So we have zero nodes,
one node, two nodes.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.368
Those are the lowest three you
can get.

00:22:23.368 --> 00:22:26.519
And then there would be three
nodes, four nodes,

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:29.940
five nodes, six nodes,
as many nodes as you want.

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.680
Okay, now this is great.
 

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.288
You can do all sorts of neat
tricks for Monday,

00:22:35.288 --> 00:22:38.116
and what I want you to do with
this program is just to fiddle

00:22:38.116 --> 00:22:40.519
around with it and make
discoveries for yourself.

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:44.439
And I'll show you some of the
kinds of discoveries that you

00:22:44.439 --> 00:22:46.670
can do in the next slides here.
 

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.332
But I warn you that if you have
more dimensions,

00:22:51.332 --> 00:22:55.201
or more particles,
things quickly become

00:22:55.201 --> 00:22:56.690
impossible.
 

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:59.980
The only thing you can do this
particular approach with is one

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.471
particle and one dimension,
because if you have more,

00:23:04.471 --> 00:23:09.868
then you don't know which
curvature to change.

00:23:09.868 --> 00:23:11.548
You know the curvature --
remember,

00:23:11.548 --> 00:23:13.700
it's a sum of a bunch of
curvatures,

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.734
and knowing the kinetic energy,
the difference between total

00:23:16.734 --> 00:23:19.103
and potential,
doesn't tell you which

00:23:19.103 --> 00:23:20.528
curvature to change.
 

00:23:20.528 --> 00:23:23.109
If there's only one then you
know that that's the one you

00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:23.710
have to do.
 

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.797
So it's going to be a heck of a
lot of work to do this for more

00:23:27.797 --> 00:23:29.115
complicated systems.
 

00:23:29.115 --> 00:23:29.710
Right?
 

00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:31.690
And that's not our purpose now.
 

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:34.586
Our purpose is to understand
how quantum mechanics works with

00:23:34.586 --> 00:23:35.598
this simple system.
 

00:23:35.598 --> 00:23:38.259
But the question is,
is it going to be worth our

00:23:38.259 --> 00:23:41.823
effort to learn how it works if
we're unable to do anything with

00:23:41.823 --> 00:23:42.220
it?
 

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:45.260
Or another way of putting it
is, "What's the reward,

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.380
what are we going to get out of
this?

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.769
Is it worth spending some time
on?"

00:23:49.769 --> 00:23:53.069
Well, here's the reward for
finding Ψ.

00:23:53.069 --> 00:23:54.170
&gt;
 

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.380
The knowledge of everything.
 

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.650
Okay?
 

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.797
For example,
you know what energies are

00:24:01.797 --> 00:24:05.991
allowed to a system;
you know what the structures

00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:08.611
can be;
you know how it behaves

00:24:08.611 --> 00:24:12.622
dynamically, how it moves;
you know how bonds work --

00:24:12.622 --> 00:24:15.420
that's what we're really after,
remember?

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.470
And you know what makes for
reactivity.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.890
So there's a pretty good pot of
gold at the end of this.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.028
So fasten your seatbelts and
put your nose to the grindstone

00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:31.027
and all sorts of metaphors,
and we'll do this for the next

00:24:31.027 --> 00:24:32.430
couple of weeks.
 

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.108
Okay?
 

00:24:33.108 --> 00:24:36.848
First we'll look at allowed
energies and structure.

00:24:36.848 --> 00:24:39.691
Okay now, of course,
we already did this,

00:24:39.691 --> 00:24:40.259
right?
 

00:24:40.259 --> 00:24:42.920
No nodes, one node, two nodes.
 

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:46.420
But what were the energies that
were allowed?

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.440
Okay, so here's a whole bunch
of them.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.778
No nodes, one node,
two nodes, three nodes,

00:24:51.778 --> 00:24:53.950
up to seven nodes or -- is it
seven?;

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.358
yes seven nodes.
 

00:24:55.358 --> 00:25:05.380
Now here are the energies:
4.15,12.44,20.74,29.04,37.34.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.368
Do you see any pattern to the
energies?

00:25:09.368 --> 00:25:13.480
You might read the title if you
have trouble seeing it.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.612
They're evenly spaced;
after the first one they're

00:25:18.612 --> 00:25:19.880
evenly spaced.
 

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.920
How about the first one
compared with zero?

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.140
How high is the first one if
you know this spacing?

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.109
Students:  Half.
 

00:25:27.109 --> 00:25:28.630
Prof: It's half.
 

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:32.535
The first one above zero is
half as big as the spacing of

00:25:32.535 --> 00:25:33.301
the others.
 

00:25:33.301 --> 00:25:33.930
Right?
 

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:38.608
So the energy is some constant,
and that constant is what?

00:25:38.608 --> 00:25:45.039
8.3 roughly,
times an integer minus a half.

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:47.559
Why do you have integers?
 

00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:52.015
Because nodes come in integers;
you can't have half a node,

00:25:52.015 --> 00:25:52.578
right?
 

00:25:52.578 --> 00:25:54.492
It's zero nodes,
one, two, three,

00:25:54.492 --> 00:25:55.509
four and so on.
 

00:25:55.509 --> 00:25:56.230
Okay?
 

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.230
So that's pretty great.
 

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:01.200
We know for springs,
or harmonic oscillators,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.098
or an atom stuck on a bond,
as long as the potential --

00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:10.076
it doesn't vibrate so much that
the potential deviates from

00:26:10.076 --> 00:26:13.505
looking like a parabola;
at the bottom of the curve it

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:14.808
looks like a parabola.
 

00:26:14.808 --> 00:26:19.569
So this is the way atoms should
behave when they're attached by

00:26:19.569 --> 00:26:21.490
bonds -- approximately.
 

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.505
Okay, now remember that
doggerel poem from 1926:

00:26:24.505 --> 00:26:28.097
"We only wish that we
could glean an inkling of what

00:26:28.097 --> 00:26:30.278
Ψ could mean."
 

00:26:30.278 --> 00:26:33.519
What have we used Ψ
for so far?

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:36.490
Student: 
&gt;

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:40.202
Prof: We used it -- its
not going to infinity -- to find

00:26:40.202 --> 00:26:42.538
out when we guessed the energy
right.

00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:45.813
It was just a tool for telling
us whether we had the right

00:26:45.813 --> 00:26:46.328
energy.
 

00:26:46.328 --> 00:26:49.398
But does Ψ really
mean something,

00:26:49.398 --> 00:26:53.038
besides just being a handy tool
for this purpose?

00:26:53.038 --> 00:26:55.919
And it was later,
six months later,

00:26:55.919 --> 00:27:01.000
in 1926, that it was suggested
what the meaning of it was.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.028
And it was in this paper by Max
Born that the --

00:27:05.028 --> 00:27:08.328
Ψ doesn't mean
anything,

00:27:08.328 --> 00:27:12.720
but Ψ^2 is
probability density,

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.740
or proportional to probability
density.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.026
If you scale it right --
remember you can scale

00:27:17.026 --> 00:27:19.808
Ψ by -- multiply it
by any number you want.

00:27:19.808 --> 00:27:22.729
If you scale it right,
it is the probability density

00:27:22.729 --> 00:27:23.759
of the particle.
 

00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:26.710
Now here's what he wrote in
German,

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:28.866
and what it says is:
"If one wishes to

00:27:28.866 --> 00:27:31.180
translate this result into
physical terms,

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.920
only one interpretation is
possible,

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:41.578
Ψ signifies the
probability ."

00:27:41.578 --> 00:27:45.998
But there's a footnote there,
because he made a mistake,

00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:50.980
and he corrected it after the
thing was already set in type.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:56.029
So he put a footnote here which
says: "A correction added

00:27:56.029 --> 00:28:00.169
in proof: more careful
consideration shows that the

00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:04.059
probably is proportional to the
square of

00:28:04.059 --> 00:28:06.130
Ψ."
 

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.488
Why couldn't it be -- why
couldn't the probability be

00:28:09.488 --> 00:28:11.490
proportional to Ψ?
 

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.230
Because Ψ can be
negative!

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.436
You can't have a
negative…

00:28:15.436 --> 00:28:16.380
Well that's one reason.
 

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.420
There were other reasons too.
 

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:23.038
I don't know how embarrassed he
was by this,

00:28:23.038 --> 00:28:26.373
but anyhow -- but since nobody
else knew what Ψ was

00:28:26.373 --> 00:28:28.131
at all,
I think he could be proud

00:28:28.131 --> 00:28:29.098
nonetheless, right?
 

00:28:29.098 --> 00:28:31.207
But anyhow, it's the square of
Ψ,

00:28:31.207 --> 00:28:34.048
not Ψ itself,
that gives probability density.

00:28:34.048 --> 00:28:38.393
Now, six months later Albert
Einstein wrote a letter to Max

00:28:38.393 --> 00:28:42.136
Born where he said something
you've probably heard:

00:28:42.136 --> 00:28:46.480
"But an inner voice tells
me that this is not the real

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.380
thing.
 

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:52.232
Theory yields a great deal,
but it brings us no nearer to

00:28:52.232 --> 00:28:54.660
the secret of the Old One.
 

00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.056
Anyway I am convinced that He
does not play dice."

00:28:58.056 --> 00:28:58.559
Right?
 

00:28:58.559 --> 00:28:59.759
So it's not probabilities.
 

00:28:59.759 --> 00:29:03.048
There's this fundamental
determinism, Einstein thinks.

00:29:03.048 --> 00:29:07.512
But it turned out that in this
respect Einstein was wrong.

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:08.140
Right?
 

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.130
It is probability.
 

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:15.180
Now, it's not probability,
it's probability density,

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.778
and we have to think a little
bit about this,

00:29:17.778 --> 00:29:20.509
and we can think of it in -- by
analogy,

00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:22.259
with mass density.
 

00:29:22.259 --> 00:29:25.778
Suppose you had a flask and it
had mercury and water and oil in

00:29:25.778 --> 00:29:26.460
it, right?
 

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.670
And you're going to ask the
question,

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:32.880
if the total mask in the flask
is one kilogram,

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.118
what fraction of that,
or how much weight,

00:29:36.118 --> 00:29:40.068
is exactly one centimeter from
the bottom?

00:29:40.068 --> 00:29:43.336
How many grams,
or what fraction of the total

00:29:43.336 --> 00:29:46.604
do you think,
would be exactly one centimeter

00:29:46.604 --> 00:29:48.089
from the bottom?
 

00:29:48.089 --> 00:29:50.369
Anybody got a guess?
 

00:29:50.369 --> 00:29:54.589
5%, 1%, ½%, 10%?
 

00:29:54.589 --> 00:29:55.450
Student:  12%.
 

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.490
Prof: 12%?
 

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:57.308
Student:  Three.
 

00:29:57.308 --> 00:29:59.655
Prof: There'll be --
this'll be an auction,

00:29:59.655 --> 00:30:00.039
right?
 

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:03.230
Do I hear higher than 12%?
 

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:05.519
Do I hear lower than 12%?
 

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:06.829
Who's bidding?
 

00:30:06.829 --> 00:30:09.359
Yes, what do you say?
 

00:30:09.359 --> 00:30:10.049
Student:  Zero.
 

00:30:10.049 --> 00:30:11.940
Prof: Zero?
 

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.259
Student: It's an exact
value.

00:30:14.259 --> 00:30:14.980
Prof: Why zero?
 

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.226
Well obviously it has to do --
different heights would have

00:30:18.226 --> 00:30:19.848
different densities,
right?

00:30:19.848 --> 00:30:23.239
So it'd be a lot more in
mercury than it would if I drew

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:25.519
the line in oil or in water,
right?

00:30:25.519 --> 00:30:27.450
But you say zero.
 

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:28.368
Why?
 

00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:29.769
Student:  Because it's
an exact value.

00:30:29.769 --> 00:30:31.769
It won't have --
Prof: Right.

00:30:31.769 --> 00:30:37.768
A plane, or a line,
or a dot doesn't have any

00:30:37.768 --> 00:30:38.721
volume.
 

00:30:38.721 --> 00:30:39.950
Right?
 

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.332
You need a volume -- it's zero,
you're right,

00:30:43.332 --> 00:30:44.868
you need a volume.
 

00:30:44.868 --> 00:30:49.053
You have to multiply density,
grams per cubic centimeter by

00:30:49.053 --> 00:30:52.660
volume, how many cubic
centimeters, in order to get

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:53.308
mass.
 

00:30:53.308 --> 00:30:57.680
And the same is true of -- so
that in this case the real

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.449
question would be how much is
between one centimeter and 1.01

00:31:02.449 --> 00:31:04.630
centimeters,
or something like that?

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.964
You could ask that question,
but you can't say how much is

00:31:06.964 --> 00:31:07.990
exactly one centimeter?
 

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.994
So you have to multiply by
volume, multiply density by

00:31:11.994 --> 00:31:13.959
volume, to get the amount.
 

00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:14.640
Right?
 

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.450
And so Ψ^2 is
probability density.

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:25.422
It's how probable it is to be
in a small volume,

00:31:25.422 --> 00:31:30.288
a unit volume,
around the point in question.

00:31:30.288 --> 00:31:32.390
So you go to some point in
question,

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.548
square Ψ,
find the density,

00:31:34.548 --> 00:31:38.308
multiply it by the volume over
which Ψ is constant

00:31:38.308 --> 00:31:39.901
--
because it doesn't vary real

00:31:39.901 --> 00:31:41.554
rapidly,
so you could choose a really

00:31:41.554 --> 00:31:43.895
small one --
multiply, and that's the

00:31:43.895 --> 00:31:46.965
probability of being in that
little block.

00:31:46.965 --> 00:31:47.640
Right?
 

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.920
Now, remember we said you could
multiply,

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.400
you could scale Ψ by
any constant you wanted to,

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:57.170
even minus one or -p or
whatever.

00:31:57.170 --> 00:31:58.170
Okay?
 

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:04.035
Is there a good value,
a preferred value to scale it

00:32:04.035 --> 00:32:04.608
by?
 

00:32:04.608 --> 00:32:09.143
You could scale it by such a
number that when it's squared

00:32:09.143 --> 00:32:13.278
and you've multiplied by volume
over every place,

00:32:13.278 --> 00:32:15.869
sum up all these little boxes,
you get one.

00:32:15.869 --> 00:32:19.140
Why do you want to get one?
 

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.551
Because the total probability
is one that it's someplace,

00:32:22.551 --> 00:32:23.038
right?
 

00:32:23.038 --> 00:32:27.220
So that process is called
normalization.

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.380
We don't usually worry about
that, right?

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.078
We usually just take whatever
numbers we want,

00:32:33.078 --> 00:32:35.108
that's convenient to plot on
the graph,

00:32:35.108 --> 00:32:39.567
and know that we have to scale
it such that if we want to

00:32:39.567 --> 00:32:44.182
calculate actual probability
density that's going to sum to

00:32:44.182 --> 00:32:44.818
one.
 

00:32:44.818 --> 00:32:49.921
Okay, so here's an example
where above we show two of these

00:32:49.921 --> 00:32:55.286
curves and below we show squares
of those, not properly scaled

00:32:55.286 --> 00:32:56.430
together.
 

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.992
There's, I think,
a little more area in the red

00:32:58.992 --> 00:33:01.390
than in the blue,
although maybe I'm bad.

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:05.170
They should have the same area,
if the thing were normalized.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.618
Okay, so that shows what it is.
 

00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:08.338
Now there's an interesting
thing about that.

00:33:08.338 --> 00:33:11.333
If you have a pendulum,
or a thing on a spring,

00:33:11.333 --> 00:33:15.304
and it's going back and forth,
where does it spend most of its

00:33:15.304 --> 00:33:15.890
time?
 

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.769
Student:  Extremes.
 

00:33:16.769 --> 00:33:20.587
Prof: At the extremes,
because it's going so slow

00:33:20.587 --> 00:33:21.005
there.
 

00:33:21.005 --> 00:33:21.630
Right?
 

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:27.858
In the blue one where does it
spend most of its time?

00:33:27.858 --> 00:33:28.858
Where does it spend most of its
time?

00:33:28.858 --> 00:33:32.500
Where is it most dense if it's
the blue wavefunction,

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.279
the lowest wavefunction,
the zero-node wavefunction?

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:40.170
Obviously it spends its time in
the middle, not at the extremes.

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:44.088
But notice if you get to the
seventh wavefunction;

00:33:44.088 --> 00:33:45.625
one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:47.349
seven;
the seventh wavefunction is

00:33:47.349 --> 00:33:52.125
going to have seven humps --
that then it's most probable at

00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:55.809
the extremes,
and as it gets -- as you get

00:33:55.809 --> 00:33:59.728
higher and higher it gets more
and more focused at the

00:33:59.728 --> 00:34:02.298
extremes,
and that's why when you get to

00:34:02.298 --> 00:34:05.516
something that's really heavy it
behaves the way you expect a

00:34:05.516 --> 00:34:07.930
pendulum or a thing on a spring
to behave.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:11.260
Okay?
 

00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:13.719
This is not normalized.
 

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:16.699
But notice something else
that's really valuable here,

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:20.228
really crucial,
which is that this line is

00:34:20.228 --> 00:34:25.135
where the potential and the
total are the same for the red

00:34:25.135 --> 00:34:25.652
curve.
 

00:34:25.652 --> 00:34:26.599
Right?
 

00:34:26.599 --> 00:34:29.489
So here is zero kinetic energy.
 

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:33.885
In here the kinetic energy is
positive, out here it's

00:34:33.885 --> 00:34:37.184
negative, and the thing can be
out here.

00:34:37.184 --> 00:34:38.030
Right?
 

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.349
So the thing exists in a region
of negative kinetic energy.

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:44.900
There's nothing special about
that.

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:45.699
Okay?
 

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:47.980
It's just that that's the way
things work.

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.880
Kinetic energy can be negative.
 

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:53.349
And in the case of the blue
one, here was the point where

00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:58.461
the kinetic energy was zero,
and all this out here is

00:34:58.461 --> 00:35:05.380
probability in a region of
negative kinetic energy.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.670
Now, what if we do it with a
Morse potential?

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.577
Notice if we look at the first
one with a Morse potential,

00:35:11.577 --> 00:35:15.280
it looks the same as it would
in a Hooke's-law harmonic

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.309
oscillator.
 

00:35:16.309 --> 00:35:18.369
Does that surprise you?
 

00:35:18.369 --> 00:35:22.036
No, because the potential looks
that way, pretty much.

00:35:22.036 --> 00:35:22.590
Right?
 

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:25.599
But as you go higher and higher
and get here to whatever that

00:35:25.599 --> 00:35:27.929
is,
the twelfth or something like

00:35:27.929 --> 00:35:30.137
that,
you can see that it's very

00:35:30.137 --> 00:35:33.510
different and it's spending a
lot of time far out.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:36.190
It's shifting its average to
the right.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:40.878
But that doesn't surprise you
because the well moves out to

00:35:40.878 --> 00:35:42.907
the right,
as you move up,

00:35:42.907 --> 00:35:47.855
in the Morse potential,
as you move to higher energy,

00:35:47.855 --> 00:35:53.010
because low kinetic energy,
which is what you have as you

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.929
move to the right,
means low curvature.

00:35:56.929 --> 00:36:03.119
Why does that make it high
probability?

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:05.280
Because as long as you have
high

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.389
curvature-over-wavefunction,
whenever the wavefunction peeks

00:36:09.389 --> 00:36:13.679
up, it gets pulled down again;
it can't stay up.

00:36:13.679 --> 00:36:16.389
But if you have very low
curvature toward the baseline,

00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:20.797
very low kinetic energy,
then it can go up and you don't

00:36:20.797 --> 00:36:23.182
mind,
because the kinetic -- you

00:36:23.182 --> 00:36:26.940
don't need much curvature when
the wavefunction is big.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.126
Okay, so it's like that,
and then out in here it's

00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:32.730
pretty much like an exponential
decay.

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:37.809
Does that surprise you?
 

00:36:37.809 --> 00:36:40.150
Kate you look like it didn't
surprise you.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:41.389
Student:  No it didn't.
 

00:36:41.389 --> 00:36:42.827
Prof: Why not?
 

00:36:42.827 --> 00:36:45.773
When do you expect the
wavefunction to be an

00:36:45.773 --> 00:36:48.719
exponential decay,
under what condition?

00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:50.719
Student: When the
potential energy --

00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:51.179
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:36:51.179 --> 00:36:52.880
Student:  When the
potential energy is constant.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.039
Prof: Ah,
when the potential energy is

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:57.199
constant, and what else to be
exponential?

00:36:57.199 --> 00:36:59.179
The sine wave is also constant.
 

00:36:59.179 --> 00:37:02.789
Student:  Right,
but it has to be --

00:37:02.789 --> 00:37:04.199
Prof: Right?
 

00:37:04.199 --> 00:37:09.369
What makes it exponential,
rather than a sine wave?

00:37:09.369 --> 00:37:09.969
Yes?
 

00:37:09.969 --> 00:37:11.510
Student:  Negative
kinetic energy.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:12.974
Prof: Ah,
the kinetic energy is negative,

00:37:12.974 --> 00:37:14.219
the potential's higher than the
total.

00:37:14.219 --> 00:37:18.246
But that's exactly the case on
the right, because there's the

00:37:18.246 --> 00:37:22.275
potential, there's the total,
and the kinetic energy is going

00:37:22.275 --> 00:37:24.126
down;
it's negative,

00:37:24.126 --> 00:37:26.980
the difference between the two.
 

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.590
Okay?
 

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:33.054
Now, here are a whole bunch of
these for the harmonic -- for

00:37:33.054 --> 00:37:34.719
the Morse potential.
 

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:40.230
How does it look different from
Hooke's law?

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.818
Does the spacing of energies
look the same as it did in

00:37:42.818 --> 00:37:43.489
Hooke's law?
 

00:37:43.489 --> 00:37:45.969
Again, it's zero nodes,
one, two, three,

00:37:45.969 --> 00:37:47.050
four and so on.
 

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:51.590
But how is it different?
 

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:52.309
Yes?
 

00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:53.980
Student: 
&gt;

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.782
Prof: Ah,
the spacing gets closer as you

00:37:56.782 --> 00:37:57.268
go up.
 

00:37:57.268 --> 00:37:59.543
So real bonds,
which have a potential that

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:01.929
looks more like this than like a
spring,

00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:06.934
will have their energy levels
get closer as you get more and

00:38:06.934 --> 00:38:09.139
more vibrational energy.
 

00:38:09.139 --> 00:38:12.230
Okay, they're not evenly spaced
as they are for Hooke's law.

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:15.614
As the energy increases,
along with the number of nodes,

00:38:15.614 --> 00:38:19.429
the well widens more than it
would for Hooke's-law parabola.

00:38:19.429 --> 00:38:23.333
So the wavelengths become
longer, those nodes are spaced

00:38:23.333 --> 00:38:27.884
over a bigger distance,
and the energies are lower than

00:38:27.884 --> 00:38:31.695
expected for Hooke's law,
because you don't have as much

00:38:31.695 --> 00:38:32.230
curvature.
 

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.110
You have the same number of
nodes --

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.289
like the eighteenth level has
the same number of nodes as it

00:38:37.289 --> 00:38:41.617
would in Hooke's law,
but they're spaced over a wider

00:38:41.617 --> 00:38:45.074
distance,
so there's less curvature,

00:38:45.074 --> 00:38:48.670
so the energy doesn't go up as
much.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.730
Okay now, this is interesting.
 

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:54.081
Look if you have the blue
energy.

00:38:54.081 --> 00:38:54.920
Right?
 

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.960
Now the wavefunction looks like
this.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.389
It's no longer bounded.
 

00:38:58.389 --> 00:39:03.059
Does it surprise you that the
wavefunction goes on out to

00:39:03.059 --> 00:39:07.978
infinity when the total energy
is higher than that potential

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:09.980
energy at the right?
 

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.679
No.
 

00:39:10.679 --> 00:39:13.110
It means you have enough energy
to break the bond.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.840
So the particle could just keep
going.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.110
Okay, now what does this look
like?

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:21.530
In this region it looks like it
does in a Hooke's law or

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:23.768
something like that,
more or less.

00:39:23.768 --> 00:39:26.750
What does it look like out at
the right?

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:30.079
It's a sine wave. Why?
 

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:32.809
Sam, does that surprise you
that it looks like a sine wave?

00:39:32.809 --> 00:39:34.219
Student:  Because the
potential is just --

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:37.188
Prof: Ah,
the potential is constant,

00:39:37.188 --> 00:39:41.360
effectively constant out there,
and lower than the total.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.949
So it's a constant.
 

00:39:42.949 --> 00:39:46.715
It's about a sine wave because
you have a constant positive

00:39:46.715 --> 00:39:49.896
kinetic energy when the total
energy is above that

00:39:49.896 --> 00:39:51.389
dissociation limit.
 

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:53.639
So there's the potential,
there's the total,

00:39:53.639 --> 00:39:56.621
and now the kinetic energy is
positive and about constant,

00:39:56.621 --> 00:39:58.610
so it's approximately a sine
wave.

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:03.320
Okay, now Coulombic potential
is a more complicated one.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.822
The reason it's complicated is
the energy goes to infinity when

00:40:06.822 --> 00:40:09.494
r becomes zero;
when the positive and the

00:40:09.494 --> 00:40:12.385
negative are on top of one
another it becomes infinitely

00:40:12.385 --> 00:40:13.070
favorable.
 

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:16.621
So it's hard to do this
numerically, and the program

00:40:16.621 --> 00:40:21.150
will screw up sometimes when you
try to do Coulombic potential.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:24.710
And it's one-dimensional,
and it turns out,

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.882
curiously enough,
that the system is simpler in

00:40:27.882 --> 00:40:30.780
three dimensions than in one
dimension,

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.760
for a Coulombic potential.
 

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:35.710
Don't worry about the technical
aspects of that.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.849
But at any rate,
this is using the program for

00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:40.512
that,
and you can see that the lowest

00:40:40.512 --> 00:40:43.981
-- that you have very,
very high curvature when you

00:40:43.981 --> 00:40:47.570
get near zero because you have
such high kinetic energy when

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:50.489
the particles get very close to
one another,

00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:54.230
and because the Erwin program
is approximate,

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:58.268
taking finite steps,
you get in trouble often.

00:40:58.268 --> 00:41:02.818
Okay, but anyhow you get the
idea that again as you get

00:41:02.818 --> 00:41:06.780
higher energy,
you get waves that spread out.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.248
And they spread out a lot for
the same reason they did in

00:41:10.248 --> 00:41:12.914
Morse potential,
although here we're using a

00:41:12.914 --> 00:41:15.516
much lighter mass,
we're using an electron.

00:41:15.516 --> 00:41:16.260
Right?
 

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:20.809
But it spreads out much more
because the well spreads out so

00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:21.349
much.
 

00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:22.530
Okay?
 

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.789
So higher levels spread way
out, and now the sequence of

00:41:26.789 --> 00:41:31.050
energies -- here's the lowest,
the next and the next.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:33.695
You have a big spacing first
and then it gets much,

00:41:33.695 --> 00:41:34.489
much smaller.
 

00:41:34.489 --> 00:41:39.722
It turns out that the energy is
some constant divided by

00:41:39.722 --> 00:41:40.960
n^2.
 

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.826
So the number one level has an
energy of -k,

00:41:45.826 --> 00:41:49.329
the next one is
-¼k.

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:53.657
The blue line is only a fourth
as far down as the green,

00:41:53.657 --> 00:41:56.489
from zero, which is up at the
top.

00:41:56.489 --> 00:42:01.005
Well zero is that grey line at
the top, because it keeps going

00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:03.079
out to zero far out there.
 

00:42:03.079 --> 00:42:11.047
And the next one is 1/9th of
the way from the top to the

00:42:11.047 --> 00:42:13.219
lowest level.
 

00:42:13.219 --> 00:42:14.922
So the reward for finding
Ψ was "the

00:42:14.922 --> 00:42:15.989
knowledge of everything."
 

00:42:15.989 --> 00:42:17.739
We've seen the allowed energy
and structure.

00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:21.135
Now we're going to see another
case where we get structure and

00:42:21.135 --> 00:42:24.197
we also see something about
dynamics that's interesting,

00:42:24.197 --> 00:42:26.090
about the motion of the atoms.
 

00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:30.422
So here's -- suppose this is a
proton attached by a bond to

00:42:30.422 --> 00:42:32.289
something that's heavy.
 

00:42:32.289 --> 00:42:35.554
So the heavy thing doesn't
move, the hydrogen does the

00:42:35.554 --> 00:42:36.110
moving.
 

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:37.099
Okay?
 

00:42:37.099 --> 00:42:39.190
And here's its wavefunction.
 

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:43.309
This is the bond distance,
the minimum energy.

00:42:43.309 --> 00:42:44.960
If you stretch the bond the
energy goes up;

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.010
if you compress the bond the
energy goes up.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:51.559
And that's the wavefunction for
the position of the hydrogen

00:42:51.559 --> 00:42:51.945
atom.
 

00:42:51.945 --> 00:42:52.639
Right?
 

00:42:52.639 --> 00:42:56.840
Now suppose we increase the
mass and instead of talking

00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.509
about a hydrogen atom we talked
about a carbon atom which had

00:43:01.509 --> 00:43:04.679
say fourteen,
depending on which isotope

00:43:04.679 --> 00:43:07.710
we're using --
suppose we went to fourteen.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:12.697
How is that going to change
things, if we have mass -- can

00:43:12.697 --> 00:43:17.510
we use the same function,
if we use mass of fourteen?

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:21.219
Notice that we're using the
same potential.

00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:24.559
So the kinetic energy at any
point is going to be the same

00:43:24.559 --> 00:43:25.380
for the two.
 

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:33.139
How does mass enter into
kinetic energy?

00:43:33.139 --> 00:43:35.070
Yes?
 

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.530
Student:  Would it be
more concentrated?

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:38.079
Prof: Can't hear.
 

00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:39.809
Student:  Would it be
more concentrated?

00:43:39.809 --> 00:43:41.449
Prof: Why do you say it
would be more concentrated?

00:43:41.449 --> 00:43:43.219
What would make it more
concentrated?

00:43:43.219 --> 00:43:46.804
Student:  Higher nuclear
charge, so the electrons would

00:43:46.804 --> 00:43:48.429
want to--;
Prof: Yes,

00:43:48.429 --> 00:43:51.079
but you're not thinking about
quantum mechanics.

00:43:51.079 --> 00:43:54.416
You're thinking that the higher
-- well no, wait a second,

00:43:54.416 --> 00:43:56.760
we're not talking nuclear
charge here.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:58.190
All we're talking is mass.
 

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.661
It's held by a spring,
we're thinking,

00:44:01.661 --> 00:44:02.320
okay?
 

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.047
So electrostatics doesn't come
into it, it's a spring that's

00:44:06.047 --> 00:44:06.869
stretching.
 

00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:07.760
Elizabeth?
 

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.681
Student:  In that
equation that you showed us

00:44:09.681 --> 00:44:11.489
before, the curvature is
proportional to mass?

00:44:11.489 --> 00:44:14.864
Prof: Yes,
the kinetic energy has one over

00:44:14.864 --> 00:44:15.780
mass in it.
 

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:20.309
So if you increase the mass,
and keep the same wave,

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:23.949
what are you going to do to the
energy?

00:44:23.949 --> 00:44:24.590
Student:  Decrease.
 

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:26.699
Prof: You're going to
decrease the energy.

00:44:26.699 --> 00:44:29.159
But it's the same energy as it
was for hydrogen.

00:44:29.159 --> 00:44:33.440
You can't just decrease the
energy, at a given position,

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.309
if you know the total.
 

00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:45.797
Okay, so you want it to be --
to get the same energy it has to

00:44:45.797 --> 00:44:48.719
be more curved.
 

00:44:48.719 --> 00:44:50.829
Okay, everybody with me?
 

00:44:50.829 --> 00:44:53.891
To have the same energy,
if you have a bigger mass in

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:56.211
the denominator,
you're going to have more

00:44:56.211 --> 00:44:58.503
curvature,
fourteen times as much

00:44:58.503 --> 00:45:02.090
curvature, to compensate for the
bigger mass.

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:05.519
So it's going to curve more
toward the baseline.

00:45:05.519 --> 00:45:05.940
Okay?
 

00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:10.190
So if we used that same energy
and had the higher mass,

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:12.650
so we got more curvature for
the same energy,

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:15.199
then it's going to curve a lot
more,

00:45:15.199 --> 00:45:17.110
it's going to go through and go
up to infinity,

00:45:17.110 --> 00:45:25.239
and it's even higher energy
than the second wave would be.

00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:26.760
It's curved way too much.
 

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.530
So how would you find the
lowest energy,

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:32.159
what would you do in your
guessing?

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:35.389
If you wanted to find the
lowest energy what would you do?

00:45:35.389 --> 00:45:39.606
You'd lower your guess to make
it less curved toward the

00:45:39.606 --> 00:45:40.449
baseline.
 

00:45:40.449 --> 00:45:41.159
Okay?
 

00:45:41.159 --> 00:45:43.755
And if you do that,
so lower the energy,

00:45:43.755 --> 00:45:46.483
from that, and there we've got
the answer.

00:45:46.483 --> 00:45:47.150
Right?
 

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:52.190
So hydrogen has a much higher
vibrational energy than carbon

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:56.550
does for the same bond,
to get the lowest energy.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.934
I think this will be clear to
you when you have time to think

00:46:00.934 --> 00:46:01.739
about it.
 

00:46:01.739 --> 00:46:04.400
If not, ask questions.
 

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:05.150
Okay?
 

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:11.353
Now what if you had U-235 or a
marble at the end of the same

00:46:11.353 --> 00:46:12.300
spring?
 

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:17.215
What do you think its
wavefunction would look like,

00:46:17.215 --> 00:46:20.460
the lowest energy wavefunction?
 

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.719
Student:  A spike.
 

00:46:22.719 --> 00:46:24.510
Prof: It's just a spike.
 

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.898
The heavier it is,
the narrower it gets.

00:46:26.898 --> 00:46:27.389
Right?
 

00:46:27.389 --> 00:46:30.588
So if you have something like a
baseball held by a bond,

00:46:30.588 --> 00:46:32.449
it's going to sit right there.
 

00:46:32.449 --> 00:46:35.110
You're not going to be able to
see that it's spread out.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:39.954
But electrons are so much
lighter than nuclei that

00:46:39.954 --> 00:46:42.920
electrons really spread out.
 

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.525
Okay, now so there are the
probability distributions for

00:46:47.525 --> 00:46:51.630
hydrogen and for carbon,
held by a single bond.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:57.320
Why is their average not in the
same position?

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:00.050
See what I mean?
 

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.730
Elizabeth?
 

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:01.239
Pardon?
 

00:47:01.239 --> 00:47:02.309
Student:  Acceleration
has to do with mass.

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:04.539
Prof: No, no.
 

00:47:04.539 --> 00:47:06.039
It has to do -- yes?
 

00:47:06.039 --> 00:47:07.976
Student:  Because the
electrons are not attracted

00:47:07.976 --> 00:47:08.329
equally.
 

00:47:08.329 --> 00:47:09.784
Prof: No,
no, it's -- remember,

00:47:09.784 --> 00:47:11.280
electrons aren't entering into
this.

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.628
We're just supposing that we
have a nucleus held by a spring

00:47:15.628 --> 00:47:19.389
and that spring is the strength
of a single-bond.

00:47:19.389 --> 00:47:21.420
Okay?
 

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:28.119
What is the potential for a
bond?

00:47:28.119 --> 00:47:33.369
Is it Hooke's law?
 

00:47:33.369 --> 00:47:36.050
What's a better potential for a
bond than Hooke's law?

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.670
Students:
 Morse potential.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:39.842
Prof: The Morse
potential, which broadens out,

00:47:39.842 --> 00:47:41.429
remember, as it goes up.
 

00:47:41.429 --> 00:47:45.650
So since hydrogen goes up more,
it samples further out to the

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:49.590
right, so it's displaced to the
right from the carbon.

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:52.579
Okay?
 

00:47:52.579 --> 00:47:56.527
Now so let's -- here they are
at their minimum energy

00:47:56.527 --> 00:47:58.730
position, and they vibrate.
 

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:01.911
The higher energy is shifted to
the right in the unsymmetrical

00:48:01.911 --> 00:48:02.849
Morse potential.
 

00:48:02.849 --> 00:48:08.056
And here's the half-maximum of
the -- so it spends -- it's half

00:48:08.056 --> 00:48:13.179
as probable -- the probability
density here is half what it is

00:48:13.179 --> 00:48:14.018
there.
 

00:48:14.018 --> 00:48:16.800
So when you say,
how far does it spread out?

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.760
This thing goes out to infinity.
 

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.813
But we can talk about how wide
it is by saying how wide it is

00:48:22.813 --> 00:48:23.679
at half-height.
 

00:48:23.679 --> 00:48:27.442
So the hydrogen at half-height
is from here to here,

00:48:27.442 --> 00:48:31.869
but the carbon at half-height
is only from there to there;

00:48:31.869 --> 00:48:38.355
that is, if you think of these
things vibrating,

00:48:38.355 --> 00:48:44.840
the hydrogen has a bigger
amplitude than carbon,

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:48.289
because it's lighter.
 

00:48:48.289 --> 00:48:54.320
So the hydrogen vibrates by 0.1
angstrom, 9% of the distance.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:00.635
The carbon vibrates only half
as much, 3% of the carbon-X

00:49:00.635 --> 00:49:06.050
distance, just because of the
mass difference.

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:10.349
And remember we said before,
last time, that typically the

00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:14.949
atoms are vibrating by about
0.05 angstroms in the crystal.

00:49:14.949 --> 00:49:17.050
That's where this came from,
it's this quantum mechanical

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:17.349
thing.
 

00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:21.443
That's the least that they can
-- and when they're in their

00:49:21.443 --> 00:49:25.253
lowest possible energy state
they vibrate by that much,

00:49:25.253 --> 00:49:25.960
right?
 

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:32.135
And that's how much it is,
that little yellow dot after it

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:33.110
shrank.
 

00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:35.639
So we've seen allowed energies
and structure.

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.768
We've seen dynamics,
the vibration.

00:49:37.768 --> 00:49:41.460
Now, next time,
we're going to look at

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:47.047
dynamics, and also the payoff,
bonding, how we understand

00:49:47.047 --> 00:49:49.940
bonding in one dimension.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.722
Prof: I'd like to
welcome you back,

00:00:03.722 --> 00:00:06.350
and hope that you all had
really good breaks.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.361
We'll be talking this week
about malaria,

00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:13.370
both today and on Wednesday.
 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.620
And I think I may be saying a
couple of things that you may

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.250
find surprising.
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.450
I suppose--this may be an
assumption--

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.011
that when I mention malaria,
that most of you think of it as

00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:34.222
an exotic tropical disease,
and probably think that it's

00:00:34.222 --> 00:00:38.733
very distant from us,
and has relatively little to do

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:42.706
with the modern world,
or with modern history,

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:47.829
and probably nothing at all to
do with the United States and

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.000
with those of us here.
 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.461
But the point I'm wanting to
make, this time and next,

00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:59.680
is that the reality of malaria
is quite different from that;

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.087
that when we've come to talk
about this disease,

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:10.090
I could say that of all human
diseases it's one of the oldest;

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.995
and some question,
a question that some of you

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:16.471
might ask me,
is of all the diseases in our

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:18.888
course,
which is the one that,

00:01:18.888 --> 00:01:22.988
in the aggregate,
has caused the most human

00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:25.230
suffering and death?
 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.885
And I think that of all of the
diseases in our course,

00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:35.900
it's probably malaria which has
that primacy.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.644
The relationship of human
beings to malaria has been so

00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:41.813
close,
and so extensive,

00:01:41.813 --> 00:01:46.208
that we could also say that we,
as a species,

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:49.220
and malaria,
as a disease,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.233
have evolved together,
and that the human genome bears

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:58.489
the imprint of our experience
with malaria.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:03.522
Good examples of that are a
couple of genetic diseases that

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:08.325
I'd like to mention,
one that may be familiar to you

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:12.479
also,
one being sickle-cell anemia,

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:19.441
a second being thalassemia,
and a third being what's called

00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:21.438
Duffy negativity.
 

00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:25.080
Now, all of these are genetic
diseases,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.657
and they have in common the
feature that there's a

00:02:29.657 --> 00:02:33.210
difference between the trait
which--

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.319
it's a recessive in all three
cases,

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.568
the recessive features.
 

00:02:38.568 --> 00:02:46.702
And, so, a heterozygote--that
is, a person who has just one X

00:02:46.702 --> 00:02:50.959
chromosome,
rather than X and Y,

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.560
expressing the trait for the
disease--

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.960
enjoys a protection from
malaria.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.883
But if, in fact,
you are a homozygote and have

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:14.306
it on both X and Y chromosomes,
and you develop the syndrome

00:03:14.306 --> 00:03:20.300
for sickle-cell anemia,
instead you have a terrible

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.831
disease that leads to--
it causes sickle cell--it

00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:31.729
affects the quality of the
hemoglobin and the red cells,

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:37.651
and therefore it leads to
anemia, occlusion of blood

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:40.435
vessels,
sometimes hypoxia,

00:03:40.435 --> 00:03:43.280
and serious respiratory
diseases.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.870
So, it's a fatal illness in
many cases.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.209
But if you have the trait,
then in a highly malarial area

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.453
you have a great selective
advantage in enjoying a great

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.788
deal of resistance or immunity.
 

00:03:59.788 --> 00:04:05.608
In terms of human evolution,
in intensely malarial areas

00:04:05.608 --> 00:04:11.639
there was a strong Darwinian
pressure for the retention of

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.389
the sickle cell trait.
 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.160
The same would be true of
thalassemia,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.708
which affects not the quality
of the red cells but rather

00:04:21.708 --> 00:04:26.675
their quantity,
and leads to again terrible

00:04:26.675 --> 00:04:36.178
complications in homozygotes,
and with asthma and terrible

00:04:36.178 --> 00:04:39.668
anemia,
or Duffy negativity,

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:44.074
which is another genetic
disease that leads again to

00:04:44.074 --> 00:04:45.889
terrible diseases.
 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.045
Another feature of malaria,
apart from the fact that our

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:53.824
genome has actually been
strongly influenced by our

00:04:53.824 --> 00:04:58.485
history with malaria,
is that until very recently it

00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:02.170
extended more or less across the
globe,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.588
affecting not only the tropics
in Africa,

00:05:05.588 --> 00:05:09.269
Asia and South America,
but also the north,

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:13.379
including most of Europe and
North America.

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.444
So, I thought I'd show you a
map of malaria in the United

00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:21.699
States in the nineteenth
century,

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.769
just to give you an idea--this
is 1882--

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:30.016
to show how extensively
prevalent it was in this

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:32.517
country,
as recently as the late

00:05:32.517 --> 00:05:33.829
nineteenth century.
 

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:38.699
And indeed it comes up--Oliver
Wendell Holmes wrote a book on

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:40.730
malaria in New England.
 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.624
This is a map of 1912,
when it's receded a great deal

00:05:44.624 --> 00:05:47.769
and is primarily a disease of
the South.

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:52.565
But remember that it had a
major impact on public health in

00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:55.572
this country,
until the end of the Second

00:05:55.572 --> 00:05:58.699
World War,
which is when it was eradicated

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:00.389
in the United States.
 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.310
It's sobering to remember,
for example,

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.709
that the Centers for Disease
Control,

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:10.555
the CDC, in Atlanta,
was originally founded as an

00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:14.944
anti-malarial agency,
and that the disease played a

00:06:14.944 --> 00:06:17.860
major role in the settlement of
the West,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.160
and in the economic and social
development of the South.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.187
And if you read Mark Twain,
for example,

00:06:24.187 --> 00:06:29.081
you can read a great deal about
shivering along the banks of the

00:06:29.081 --> 00:06:30.790
Mississippi River.
 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.538
In terms of our discussion of
relationship of diseases to the

00:06:36.538 --> 00:06:41.067
big picture of history,
malaria is also one of the

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:45.064
diseases that I think helps us
to make the case most

00:06:45.064 --> 00:06:46.240
effectively.
 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.766
Malaria, it's now believed,
played a major part in the

00:06:50.766 --> 00:06:52.396
fall,
for example,

00:06:52.396 --> 00:06:55.473
of the Roman Empire,
when an epidemic of

00:06:55.473 --> 00:07:00.288
falciparum malaria led to
the disruption of agriculture

00:07:00.288 --> 00:07:02.420
and the Roman Legions.
 

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.315
And I'm not trying to say that
malaria caused the downfall of

00:07:06.315 --> 00:07:07.550
the Roman Empire.
 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.209
I'm saying that it was a major
factor,

00:07:10.209 --> 00:07:14.336
leading to the kinds of
military problems and social

00:07:14.336 --> 00:07:19.435
dislocation that we can't ignore
in discussing that major series

00:07:19.435 --> 00:07:20.569
of events.
 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:26.999
It's led to major impacts on
the outcome and on the conduct

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:28.439
of warfare.
 

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:32.413
One need go back only to the
Second World War,

00:07:32.413 --> 00:07:37.182
when malaria was a major
preoccupation of the armies on

00:07:37.182 --> 00:07:39.920
both sides of the conflict.
 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.930
It had an enormous role and
impact on European expansion and

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.882
colonization,
and one of the great challenges

00:07:48.882 --> 00:07:52.528
to colonial expansion,
in the Indian subcontinent,

00:07:52.528 --> 00:07:55.916
and in Africa,
was what to do about the

00:07:55.916 --> 00:07:57.930
problem of malaria.
 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.899
It's affected the pattern of
human habitation and settlement,

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:08.420
the way that cities and towns
are built across the landscape,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.273
where human habitation often
was a form of prophylaxis for

00:08:13.273 --> 00:08:16.310
malaria,
and people lived far from

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.115
swampy areas,
and often on high ground,

00:08:20.115 --> 00:08:23.680
above dangerous wetlands low
down.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.464
Malaria is also a major factor
in economic development and

00:08:28.464 --> 00:08:32.240
under-development today,
in ways that we'll be

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.500
discussing.
 

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.010
A decisive factor in its
prevalence, and in its history,

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:44.022
has always been the
relationship of human beings to

00:08:44.022 --> 00:08:49.966
agriculture and the environment;
that is to say that intensive

00:08:49.966 --> 00:08:54.924
forms of agriculture,
with modern livestock raising

00:08:54.924 --> 00:08:58.243
practices,
modern crop rotations,

00:08:58.243 --> 00:09:02.368
water management,
ecological sanitation,

00:09:02.368 --> 00:09:07.428
with improved housing and
conditions of diet,

00:09:07.428 --> 00:09:11.344
wages and clothing,
have led, wherever they've been

00:09:11.344 --> 00:09:15.504
introduced,
to a spontaneous recession of

00:09:15.504 --> 00:09:19.840
malaria and much better health
outcomes.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.447
And this has been a major
factor in the divergence between

00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:27.678
the global North and the global
South;

00:09:27.678 --> 00:09:31.466
the North with modernized
intensive systems of

00:09:31.466 --> 00:09:35.067
agriculture,
and in the South instead the

00:09:35.067 --> 00:09:40.408
persistence of extensive forms
of practice that are conducive,

00:09:40.408 --> 00:09:44.980
for reasons we'll be examining,
to the transmission of malaria.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:51.167
So, malaria both reflects and
reinforces developmental

00:09:51.167 --> 00:09:54.668
differences and disparities.
 

00:09:54.668 --> 00:09:59.958
Now, let's remember that
malaria is vitally important in

00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:01.690
our world today.
 

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:07.292
Let me give you an example of
some of the pictures that

00:10:07.292 --> 00:10:11.649
represent the global burden of
malaria,

00:10:11.649 --> 00:10:18.259
and let me show you a map of
where malaria is prevalent

00:10:18.259 --> 00:10:21.548
today;
that is, in the twenty-first

00:10:21.548 --> 00:10:22.288
century.
 

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:27.764
Indeed, at the moment,
one can say the statistics are

00:10:27.764 --> 00:10:29.450
extraordinary.
 

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:36.779
About 500,000 people become
seriously ill of malaria every

00:10:36.779 --> 00:10:37.678
year.
 

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:41.519
Approximately a million people
die of it,

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:46.220
the majority of them being
children under five,

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:50.705
and pregnant women,
concentrated particularly in

00:10:50.705 --> 00:10:52.710
Sub-Saharan Africa.
 

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:58.570
In fact, one can say that a
child dies of malaria,

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:03.139
in Africa today,
every thirty seconds,

00:11:03.139 --> 00:11:07.980
making this disease a global
public health emergency,

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.620
along with HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.259
Let's look at more particularly
the areas.

00:11:16.259 --> 00:11:20.597
This is the epicenter,
if you like,

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:27.105
of the present day resurgence
of malaria as a major,

00:11:27.105 --> 00:11:31.190
major public health problem.
 

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:38.547
And there are--malaria kills
3,000 children every day of the

00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:39.418
year.
 

00:11:39.418 --> 00:11:46.014
The burden of malaria though is
greater than statistics for

00:11:46.014 --> 00:11:49.879
mortality and morbidity suggest.
 

00:11:49.879 --> 00:11:55.068
It is, for example,
one of the worst possible

00:11:55.068 --> 00:11:58.490
complications of pregnancy.
 

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:01.678
It leads to high rates of
miscarriage;

00:12:01.678 --> 00:12:07.385
to maternal death through
hemorrhaging and severe anemia,

00:12:07.385 --> 00:12:13.091
and all of the sequelae that
follow from severe low birth

00:12:13.091 --> 00:12:14.009
rate.
 

00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:17.370
Malaria also can be transmitted
vertically;

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.770
that is, trans-plancentally,
from mother to fetus,

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:26.802
and can lead to the birth of
infants who are congenitally

00:12:26.802 --> 00:12:27.970
infected.
 

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.639
We also need to remember,
as we'll say in a moment,

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:36.509
that malaria is a major
immunosuppressive disease,

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:41.029
and its victims therefore are
highly susceptible to other

00:12:41.029 --> 00:12:45.476
opportunistic infections;
especially respiratory

00:12:45.476 --> 00:12:50.418
infections, tuberculosis,
influenza, pneumonia.

00:12:50.418 --> 00:12:54.827
In those areas of the tropical
world where malaria is

00:12:54.827 --> 00:12:57.889
hyper-endemic,
and transmission continues

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:01.594
throughout the year,
the population at risk can be

00:13:01.594 --> 00:13:05.717
infected,
re-infected and super-infected

00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:07.769
every single year.
 

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:12.422
If the victims of malaria
survive, they possess a

00:13:12.422 --> 00:13:15.330
painfully acquired immunity.
 

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:20.697
But it comes at a terrible
price, because repeated bouts of

00:13:20.697 --> 00:13:24.956
malaria lead to severe
neurological deficit and

00:13:24.956 --> 00:13:27.269
cognitive impairment.
 

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:32.490
The results are ineradicable
poverty, illiteracy and

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:38.428
compromised economic growth,
a stunted development of civil

00:13:38.428 --> 00:13:42.320
society and political
instability.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.350
We'll be talking in a moment
about Ronald Ross,

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:51.125
who was the Nobel Laureate,
who was one of two people who

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:56.330
discovered the mosquito theory
of transmission for disease.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.777
And he wrote,
quite movingly,

00:13:58.777 --> 00:14:03.865
that those malaria doesn't--
in areas where malaria is

00:14:03.865 --> 00:14:08.532
prevalent--
"those it doesn't kill it

00:14:08.532 --> 00:14:10.389
enslaves."
 

00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:13.710
Malaria, in other words,
in our present world,

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:19.003
is a major contributor to
inequalities between North and

00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:21.874
South,
and to the economic and

00:14:21.874 --> 00:14:26.058
political international
dependency of third-world

00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:29.110
countries in the tropical world.
 

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:34.145
Well, let's talk about
the--malaria also will be of

00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:40.190
interest to us because it's an
extremely complex disease,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:44.595
and so we need to spend a
little bit of time talking about

00:14:44.595 --> 00:14:48.471
how it's transmitted,
and about its effects on the

00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:51.354
human body,
in order, after that,

00:14:51.354 --> 00:14:55.798
to talk about how the
discoveries that led to our

00:14:55.798 --> 00:15:01.889
understanding of it,
and to the impact on society

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:04.100
and on history.
 

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.846
Until the end of the nineteenth
century, malaria was thought to

00:15:09.846 --> 00:15:14.110
be explained by a theory that
you already know,

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.778
by miasmatism.
 

00:15:15.778 --> 00:15:20.538
In other words,
malaria was a form of bad air.

00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:24.124
In fact, that's what the word
means, from the Italian

00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:26.398
mala, bad,
and aria,

00:15:26.398 --> 00:15:26.950
air.
 

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:32.524
So, malaria was bad air that
somehow a susceptible person

00:15:32.524 --> 00:15:35.738
inhaled,
and it got in his or her body,

00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:39.198
or was absorbed,
perhaps, through the pores of

00:15:39.198 --> 00:15:43.490
the skin,
and led, in susceptible people,

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.168
to this terrible fever.
 

00:15:46.168 --> 00:15:50.885
It was also sometimes called
paludisme, from the word for

00:15:50.885 --> 00:15:54.139
swamp;
so it was swamp fever.

00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:59.759
So, the disease then was
absorbed or breathed in,

00:15:59.759 --> 00:16:01.399
in some way.
 

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:07.048
In fact, malaria isn't one
disease.

00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:13.187
It's a family of four different
diseases, caused by a parasite,

00:16:13.187 --> 00:16:16.950
with an extremely complex
lifecycle.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:21.936
The parasite is known as a
plasmodium, and there are four

00:16:21.936 --> 00:16:26.299
species of plasmodium that cause
human malaria.

00:16:26.299 --> 00:16:28.668
And I have them on your handout.
 

00:16:28.668 --> 00:16:31.782
They're Plasmodium
falciparum,

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:36.192
Plasmodium vivax,
Plasmodium malariae,

00:16:36.192 --> 00:16:38.960
and Plasmodium ovale.
 

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.850
For the purposes here,
the first two,

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.908
Plasmodium falciparum
and Plasmodium vivax,

00:16:45.908 --> 00:16:51.070
are the most important,
medically and historically,

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:55.629
and the ones we'll be talking
about mostly.

00:16:55.629 --> 00:17:00.163
Now, the plasmodia differ
fundamentally from the other

00:17:00.163 --> 00:17:05.210
microbial pathogens we've
examined so far in the course--

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.710
bacteria, for example,
and viruses--

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.598
in that they're much more
complex life forms,

00:17:11.598 --> 00:17:17.259
with complex lifecycles that we
need to unravel.

00:17:17.259 --> 00:17:25.125
Plasmodia were discovered in
1884 by Alphonse Laveran--there

00:17:25.125 --> 00:17:31.660
he is--a French Army doctor
working in Algeria.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.611
It turns out that the plasmodia
don't exist free in the

00:17:37.611 --> 00:17:42.240
environment at any stage of
their lives.

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:48.623
Instead, they're adapted to
live either in the body of human

00:17:48.623 --> 00:17:54.788
beings, or in the gut of certain
species of mosquitoes.

00:17:54.788 --> 00:18:08.021
And--there we are--this is an
anopheles mosquito doing its

00:18:08.021 --> 00:18:11.449
thing;
that is to say,

00:18:11.449 --> 00:18:16.575
having a blood meal,
which is the way that malaria

00:18:16.575 --> 00:18:20.759
is transmitted from person to
person.

00:18:20.759 --> 00:18:25.101
The plasmodia--this is again,
in a more schematic way,

00:18:25.101 --> 00:18:30.179
it gets the point across about
the relationship of human beings

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:31.900
and the mosquito.
 

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:38.540
Plasmodia migrate in the body
of the insect to the salivary

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:42.318
glands in the biting apparatus.
 

00:18:42.318 --> 00:18:46.394
So, a biting mosquito,
like this one,

00:18:46.394 --> 00:18:51.490
is in effect an extremely
efficient vector.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:56.068
It's sometimes referred to as a
flying syringe,

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.759
because what it does,
the mosquito does,

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:05.790
is to inoculate the plasmodia
directly into the bloodstream of

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.058
the host.
 

00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:11.964
At this stage the
parasite--we'll move to look at

00:19:11.964 --> 00:19:14.009
what happens next.
 

00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:21.411
The first thing we have is the
mosquito taking a blood meal and

00:19:21.411 --> 00:19:28.215
inoculating the plasmodia
directly into the bloodstream of

00:19:28.215 --> 00:19:31.440
the unfortunate victim.
 

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.359
At that stage--and here we'll
see one of the points about the

00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:39.007
plasmodia,
is that it undergoes a series

00:19:39.007 --> 00:19:44.601
of morphological changes in
becoming distinct stages in its

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:48.326
life,
both in the human body and in

00:19:48.326 --> 00:19:50.690
the body of the insect.
 

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:55.838
Initially when it's injected,
it's known as a sporazoite,

00:19:55.838 --> 00:19:59.230
and what it does next is it
migrates,

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:02.358
after just a few hours after
inoculation--

00:20:02.358 --> 00:20:07.930
say you were bitten right now,
within a few hours the

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:13.928
plasmodia in your bloodstream
would have migrated to your

00:20:13.928 --> 00:20:15.000
liver.
 

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.457
And this begins the incubation
period in which the plasmodium

00:20:22.457 --> 00:20:28.299
reproduces--that is,
asexually--in the liver.

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:32.048
And you see its reproduction.
 

00:20:32.048 --> 00:20:37.604
And then after just a number of
days or weeks,

00:20:37.604 --> 00:20:44.885
it's released again now in a
new phase, this time known as a

00:20:44.885 --> 00:20:49.328
merozoite, into the bloodstream.
 

00:20:49.328 --> 00:20:52.130
So, it returns at that point to
the bloodstream.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.423
One of the points of the
migration to the liver is that

00:20:56.423 --> 00:21:00.241
when it's in the liver,
it's safely beyond the

00:21:00.241 --> 00:21:03.348
detection of the human immune
system,

00:21:03.348 --> 00:21:09.098
and so it reproduces safely in
the liver and then emerges,

00:21:09.098 --> 00:21:14.419
much more numerous,
into the bloodstream in a new

00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:17.190
phase in its lifecycle.
 

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:23.006
At this point in the
bloodstream what happens is that

00:21:23.006 --> 00:21:26.762
the merozoites--
that's what they're now called,

00:21:26.762 --> 00:21:29.348
the new name of the parasite
for that phase--

00:21:29.348 --> 00:21:36.453
it enters into--it attaches
itself to and enters into red

00:21:36.453 --> 00:21:40.259
blood cells or erythrocytes.
 

00:21:40.259 --> 00:21:44.568
Once safely inside the red
blood cell--

00:21:44.568 --> 00:21:48.318
again it's not detected by the
immune system--

00:21:48.318 --> 00:21:54.420
it reproduces asexually--and
you can see it doing so--

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.775
until at a certain point it has
destroyed the red blood cell and

00:21:59.775 --> 00:22:04.788
ruptures the red blood cell,
and the parasites return once

00:22:04.788 --> 00:22:06.920
again to the bloodstream.
 

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.808
I have--this is a picture.
 

00:22:09.808 --> 00:22:14.240
These are of the--by electron
microscope--

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.509
of the actual rupturing of red
blood cells,

00:22:18.509 --> 00:22:21.981
and the emergence,
once gain, of the parasites

00:22:21.981 --> 00:22:27.017
that have just reproduced,
returning to the open

00:22:27.017 --> 00:22:28.750
bloodstream.
 

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:33.320
At that point,
the much more numerous

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:41.450
merozoites keep repeating this
process of invading red cells,

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:45.930
reproducing,
destroying the red blood cells,

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.858
and then bursting them at
periodic intervals.

00:22:49.858 --> 00:22:54.865
The interval of time that it
takes is determined by the

00:22:54.865 --> 00:22:57.088
species of plasmodium.
 

00:22:57.088 --> 00:23:01.204
For Plasmodium
falciparum and vivax,

00:23:01.204 --> 00:23:03.808
it's every forty-eight hours.
 

00:23:03.808 --> 00:23:08.618
And so for Plasmodium
malariae,

00:23:08.618 --> 00:23:11.868
it's every seventy-two.
 

00:23:11.868 --> 00:23:17.548
Now, eventually,
among the brood of merozoites--

00:23:17.548 --> 00:23:23.892
that is, let's see,
again--after it's gone through

00:23:23.892 --> 00:23:29.609
a number of cycles,
they produce among their

00:23:29.609 --> 00:23:36.067
offspring what are called--
it's a new morphologically

00:23:36.067 --> 00:23:40.250
different stage in the
lifecycle,

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:45.480
and that is gametocytes,
that are male and female;

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.788
and these are in the open
bloodstream.

00:23:47.788 --> 00:23:52.913
And then the next anopheline
mosquito that takes a blood

00:23:52.913 --> 00:23:56.737
meal,
as it does so it sucks up the

00:23:56.737 --> 00:24:03.528
male and female gametocytes that
reproduce sexually this time--

00:24:03.528 --> 00:24:09.928
we see them here--in the gut,
in the body of the female

00:24:09.928 --> 00:24:13.961
mosquito,
and then that begins the phase

00:24:13.961 --> 00:24:18.663
of life in the body of the
mosquito where once again we

00:24:18.663 --> 00:24:23.275
find it reproduces;
and eventually it leads to the

00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:27.768
production of sporozoites that
migrate, once again,

00:24:27.768 --> 00:24:32.260
to the biting apparatus,
the salivary glands of the

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.519
mosquito.
 

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:37.759
The mosquito again takes an
infective bite and then--

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:40.608
in its next blood meal--and the
whole cycle,

00:24:40.608 --> 00:24:46.494
this complex cycle of both
asexual reproduction in the body

00:24:46.494 --> 00:24:49.842
of man,
and sexual reproduction in the

00:24:49.842 --> 00:24:55.548
body of the mosquito,
the cycle is then complete.

00:24:55.548 --> 00:25:04.876
Now, let's return for a second
to the plasmodia and to the

00:25:04.876 --> 00:25:06.348
insect.
 

00:25:06.348 --> 00:25:12.660
And let me just deal with the
fact that in order--

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:18.961
the reason that the female--and
it's only female anophelines

00:25:18.961 --> 00:25:23.338
that take blood meals on human
beings--

00:25:23.338 --> 00:25:29.146
and the reason that the female
anopheline does that is that it

00:25:29.146 --> 00:25:34.670
needs blood in order to mature
its eggs and to lay them.

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:41.880
Having taken a blood meal,
she's able to mature her eggs,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:47.779
and at that point lays them in
water,

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:50.529
and they pass through the cycle
of larvae,

00:25:50.529 --> 00:25:56.390
pupae, and then the adult
mosquito known as an imago.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.130
Now, what happens at that point?
 

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:03.769
It takes about a week for the
eggs to develop as larvae,

00:26:03.769 --> 00:26:08.403
pupae and then adult
mosquitoes, and then the

00:26:08.403 --> 00:26:14.618
mosquito is ready to take flight
and to visit you and me.

00:26:14.618 --> 00:26:19.759
From the breeding site to the
blood meal, the anopheles

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:25.660
mosquitoes have delicate wings
and are normally weak flyers.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:30.598
So, normally she flies about no
more than three kilometers or

00:26:30.598 --> 00:26:32.740
so, from her birthplace.
 

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:38.800
Most species of anopheles avoid
sunlight, that dries up their

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.538
wings, and they avoid strong
winds.

00:26:42.538 --> 00:26:46.230
But as they take flight,
they're able to orient

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.680
themselves to places of human
settlement.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.298
Why?
 

00:26:50.298 --> 00:26:57.393
Because on their antennae there
are sensors that are highly

00:26:57.393 --> 00:27:02.528
stimulated by carbon dioxide in
the air.

00:27:02.528 --> 00:27:08.230
And, so, this--the carbon
dioxide plume arising from human

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:13.930
settlements and human bodies,
enables the mosquitoes to be

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.130
attracted to them.
 

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:22.163
Having arrived at closer range,
the mosquitoes then detect,

00:27:22.163 --> 00:27:27.259
with other sensors,
odors emanating from sweat.

00:27:27.259 --> 00:27:30.190
They're also attracted by light.
 

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:35.037
And then at close range they
finally use their vision to

00:27:35.037 --> 00:27:40.588
settle on the site of the body
most suitable for their feast.

00:27:40.588 --> 00:27:45.527
And human beings cooperate in
this enterprise in that

00:27:45.527 --> 00:27:50.558
anopheline mosquitoes feast
between dusk and dawn,

00:27:50.558 --> 00:27:53.809
and they thereby attack
sleeping bodies,

00:27:53.809 --> 00:27:57.078
lying mostly motionless.
 

00:27:57.078 --> 00:28:02.012
Now, when you hear the buzz of
the harmless culex mosquito that

00:28:02.012 --> 00:28:06.548
buzzes noisily around you and
attracts your attention,

00:28:06.548 --> 00:28:10.880
you can be happy,
because most anophelines that

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.528
transmit malaria are silent and
therefore don't disturb their

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.470
hosts.
 

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:23.630
You're probably wondering,
how is it that transmission is

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:30.118
maintained if the vast majority
of mosquitoes don't transmit

00:28:30.118 --> 00:28:31.440
malaria?
 

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.940
Only the females of certain
species of anophelines--

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.846
and I've included two on your
handout as being most important

00:28:40.846 --> 00:28:46.424
to us: Anopheles gambiae,
which would be my candidate for

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:51.328
the most deadly insect for human
beings on our planet,

00:28:51.328 --> 00:28:54.001
and Anopheles
labranchiae,

00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:58.680
which was one of the most
important vectors of malaria in

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.519
Europe and in parts of Africa.
 

00:29:01.519 --> 00:29:06.593
You're probably wondering if a
female anopheline mosquito lives

00:29:06.593 --> 00:29:11.048
on average just a few weeks,
and needs to be infected

00:29:11.048 --> 00:29:14.410
herself before transmitting the
disease,

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.788
how can transmission be
maintained?

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:19.680
Well, there's a couple of facts
that we need to remember.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:25.494
First, is the vast numbers of
mosquitoes involved in areas

00:29:25.494 --> 00:29:28.250
where malaria is endemic.
 

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:32.278
In most areas of high
endemicity, no more than two

00:29:32.278 --> 00:29:36.635
percent or so of female
mosquitoes are infected at any

00:29:36.635 --> 00:29:37.868
given time.
 

00:29:37.868 --> 00:29:42.210
But on average,
a human being can be bitten

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.308
thousands of time in a year.
 

00:29:45.308 --> 00:29:49.490
And it's also true that an
insect like Anopheles

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:54.338
gambiae is famished and
doesn't feed a single time,

00:29:54.338 --> 00:29:58.404
but having entered a place of
human settlement feasts

00:29:58.404 --> 00:30:02.090
repeatedly,
moving from one body to

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:08.288
another, thereby ensuring that
in crowded conditions one

00:30:08.288 --> 00:30:14.938
malarial patient is a major
source of danger to all of those

00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:17.528
around him or her.
 

00:30:17.528 --> 00:30:22.269
Well, that's the story from the
standpoint of the mosquito.

00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:24.630
What happens to the human
victim?

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:28.028
What are the symptoms of
malaria?

00:30:28.028 --> 00:30:34.818
How does the disease have its
impact on the human body?

00:30:34.818 --> 00:30:40.960
After the incubation period,
symptoms begin when the

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:47.823
plasmodia have achieved a
critical threshold number in the

00:30:47.823 --> 00:30:49.750
bloodstream.
 

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:55.948
It's then that the classical
symptoms of malaria begin,

00:30:55.948 --> 00:30:58.130
with their onset.
 

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:06.078
Now, let's remember--return to
our diagram.

00:31:06.078 --> 00:31:11.680
This process of reproduction,
of entering--

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:17.730
that is to say the parasite
enters the blood cell,

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.886
reproduces, bursts the blood
cell and returns to the

00:31:21.886 --> 00:31:25.961
bloodstream--
occurs simultaneously for an

00:31:25.961 --> 00:31:30.140
entire brood throughout the
bloodstream.

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:34.056
In other words,
this is happening at the same

00:31:34.056 --> 00:31:36.460
time throughout the body.
 

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:40.548
And it's when there are
sufficient numbers of the

00:31:40.548 --> 00:31:45.743
parasite in the open bloodstream
that the immune system of the

00:31:45.743 --> 00:31:52.069
body can detect the parasite,
and it's then that symptoms

00:31:52.069 --> 00:31:52.960
begin.
 

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.352
The term for malaria also--it
has many names,

00:31:57.352 --> 00:31:58.848
this disease.
 

00:31:58.848 --> 00:32:02.588
It was often called
intermittent fever.

00:32:02.588 --> 00:32:07.076
This process of synchronicity
was known as Golgi's law,

00:32:07.076 --> 00:32:11.980
after the malariologist Camillo
Golgi, who discovered it;

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:17.038
and he talked about the
different timings of fever.

00:32:17.038 --> 00:32:20.492
Tertian fever,
that is to say,

00:32:20.492 --> 00:32:24.944
every forty-eight hours;
or Quartan fever,

00:32:24.944 --> 00:32:29.068
every seventy-two hours;
or Quotidian fever.

00:32:29.068 --> 00:32:34.592
You can also have a bout of
intense fever every twenty-four

00:32:34.592 --> 00:32:37.202
hours,
and that means that you have

00:32:37.202 --> 00:32:40.769
more than one species of
plasmodium in your bloodstream.

00:32:40.769 --> 00:32:45.638
You don't have to choose just
one, you can have several

00:32:45.638 --> 00:32:50.690
species and several types in
your bloodstream at once.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.183
If that occurs,
you can have fever,

00:32:53.183 --> 00:32:56.558
intermittent fever,
every twenty-four hours.

00:32:56.558 --> 00:33:01.763
The recurring classic symptoms
then are this intermittent

00:33:01.763 --> 00:33:06.411
fever, recurring at regular
intervals, like a train

00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:07.618
schedule.
 

00:33:07.618 --> 00:33:12.490
You have recurring paroxysms of
high temperature,

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:16.931
plus chills,
profuse sweating,

00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:20.936
headache,
general malaise,

00:33:20.936 --> 00:33:26.220
exhaustion, and with it often
nausea,

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.618
vomiting and diarrhea.
 

00:33:29.618 --> 00:33:35.170
The precise symptoms depend on
the species of plasmodium,

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:39.509
and the most virulent is
Plasmodium falciparum,

00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:45.190
which causes the most frequent
life-threatening complications,

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:51.402
and Plasmodium malariae
and ovale are the most

00:33:51.402 --> 00:33:52.140
mild.
 

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:59.095
You see that by entering the
red and attacking red blood

00:33:59.095 --> 00:34:06.430
cells, the parasite initiates a
cascade of consequences.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:11.280
The red cells can become
misshapen,

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.070
and they adhere to one another
in clumps,

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:20.590
thereby causing blockages in
blood cells- blood vessels,

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:25.331
that can be rapidly fatal,
depending on the organ that's

00:34:25.331 --> 00:34:26.280
affected.
 

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:31.289
A frequent cause of mortality
is cerebral malaria,

00:34:31.289 --> 00:34:35.789
in which there are blockages in
the brain.

00:34:35.789 --> 00:34:38.860
But the heart can also be
affected, or the

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:43.277
gastrointestinal system;
and if malaria attacks the

00:34:43.277 --> 00:34:48.594
gastrointestinal in particular,
it mimics the symptoms of

00:34:48.594 --> 00:34:50.400
Asiatic cholera.
 

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:56.052
Destruction of the red blood
cells also is a cause of

00:34:56.052 --> 00:34:58.010
profound anemia.
 

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.389
Another important symptom of
the disease is--

00:35:02.389 --> 00:35:06.789
and this is a child who's a
malaria patient,

00:35:06.789 --> 00:35:11.666
and what you see is a painful
and pronounced swelling of the

00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:12.409
spleen.
 

00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:18.460
This is one of the classic
signs of malarial infection.

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:22.835
As I've said,
also malaria is terrible in its

00:35:22.835 --> 00:35:27.952
effects on pregnant women,
leading to hemorrhaging and

00:35:27.952 --> 00:35:31.809
miscarriage,
and also to congenital malaria

00:35:31.809 --> 00:35:35.050
with infants born with the
disease.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:42.016
Malaria also is a disease
that's a major immunosuppressive

00:35:42.016 --> 00:35:43.239
disease.
 

00:35:43.239 --> 00:35:48.478
It suppresses the immune system
of the body, and therefore gives

00:35:48.478 --> 00:35:52.137
rise to complications,
especially respiratory

00:35:52.137 --> 00:35:54.996
diseases;
as I mentioned earlier,

00:35:54.996 --> 00:35:58.010
pneumonia, influenza and
tuberculosis.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:03.063
So, we should say that the
tuberculosis emergency in the

00:36:03.063 --> 00:36:08.576
present day, and the malaria
emergency, are inter-locking and

00:36:08.576 --> 00:36:14.612
inter-related;
malaria provides the substratum

00:36:14.612 --> 00:36:20.268
for rampaging re-emerging
tuberculosis.

00:36:20.268 --> 00:36:25.440
I also said that recurring
bouts of malaria lead to

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:30.942
neurological damage,
and in the worst cases to a

00:36:30.942 --> 00:36:36.635
state known as cachexia,
in which a person is

00:36:36.635 --> 00:36:42.010
indifferent to his or her
surroundings;

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:47.208
is unable to learn to be
productive, to take part in

00:36:47.208 --> 00:36:48.840
civil society.
 

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.800
Another feature of malaria is
that it can lead to relapses;

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.559
that is, with Plasmodium
vivax.

00:36:56.559 --> 00:37:01.684
You remember that after the
plasmodium is injected into the

00:37:01.684 --> 00:37:05.219
bloodstream, it migrates to the
liver.

00:37:05.219 --> 00:37:09.663
Well in Plasmodium
vivax, the parasite does

00:37:09.663 --> 00:37:13.199
emerge, but not all of the
parasites.

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:18.438
They continue to nestle in the
liver, and they're beyond the

00:37:18.438 --> 00:37:21.369
detection of the immune system.
 

00:37:21.369 --> 00:37:25.362
And they can then--even after
the patient thinks that he or

00:37:25.362 --> 00:37:29.628
she has recovered,
there can be a relapse when the

00:37:29.628 --> 00:37:31.693
plasmodia,
the parasites,

00:37:31.693 --> 00:37:34.960
re-emerge from the liver into
the bloodstream.

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.148
This can be months later,
or even years later,

00:37:39.148 --> 00:37:41.940
after the initial infection.
 

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:46.927
Immunity--that is,
once you've had lots of bouts

00:37:46.927 --> 00:37:53.186
of malaria, and you survive,
you develop a partial immunity,

00:37:53.186 --> 00:37:55.840
an acquired immunity.
 

00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:02.364
But it is short-term,
and it's also at considerable

00:38:02.364 --> 00:38:09.018
cost in terms of neurological
damage to the body.

00:38:09.018 --> 00:38:12.771
Well, the impact on society,
as you can imagine,

00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:15.708
is severe;
and we'll be talking about that

00:38:15.708 --> 00:38:16.409
next time.
 

00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:19.760
But it leads,
this disease--the symptoms,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.130
listing the symptoms,
helps us to understand that

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:26.617
someone like this as an adult,
who's anemic,

00:38:26.617 --> 00:38:30.119
who has perhaps respiratory
diseases,

00:38:30.119 --> 00:38:34.623
moves painfully and slowly,
and is therefore not a

00:38:34.623 --> 00:38:39.219
productive worker in agriculture
or in industry.

00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:43.516
So, malaria leads to backward
systems of cultivation,

00:38:43.516 --> 00:38:46.987
low productivity,
and lack of investment in

00:38:46.987 --> 00:38:48.309
agriculture.
 

00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:53.083
It leads to the desertion of
whole- of some of the most

00:38:53.083 --> 00:38:57.063
fertile areas,
land, because it's particularly

00:38:57.063 --> 00:39:00.070
dangerous, and known to be so.
 

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.469
It leads then to poverty,
to illiteracy.

00:39:04.469 --> 00:39:09.987
Indeed, malaria and poverty are
mutually reinforcing in a kind

00:39:09.987 --> 00:39:12.610
of vicious downward spiral.
 

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:16.809
Poverty makes people vulnerable
to the disease.

00:39:16.809 --> 00:39:20.239
Poverty, that is,
makes people vulnerable because

00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:24.670
it causes them to live in poor
housing, overcrowded housing;

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:31.518
housing that's porous and
vulnerable to flying insects.

00:39:31.518 --> 00:39:36.518
It also leads them to
occupational hazards in having

00:39:36.518 --> 00:39:41.420
to work in areas where the
disease is prevalent.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.344
It leads to poor diet,
which makes people more

00:39:45.344 --> 00:39:48.068
vulnerable;
to inadequate clothing,

00:39:48.068 --> 00:39:51.659
which makes them more
vulnerable to biting insects.

00:39:51.659 --> 00:39:56.036
But malaria,
in turn, then leads to further

00:39:56.036 --> 00:39:57.079
poverty.
 

00:39:57.079 --> 00:40:01.606
The burden of looking after the
ill, that falls on families and

00:40:01.606 --> 00:40:04.190
communities;
low productivity;

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.909
low wages;
limited education.

00:40:06.909 --> 00:40:11.996
This was what Ross meant when
he says, "Those malaria

00:40:11.996 --> 00:40:15.030
doesn't kill,
it enslaves."

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:20.594
Well, when was the mosquito
theory of transmission

00:40:20.594 --> 00:40:23.320
unraveled, and how so?
 

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:28.891
The idea that mosquitoes were
involved in this disease wasn't

00:40:28.891 --> 00:40:30.469
at all obvious.
 

00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:35.150
It wasn't obvious because,
well, first of all scientists

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:40.255
and physicians knew that there
are lots of places where there

00:40:40.255 --> 00:40:44.340
are gazillions of mosquitoes and
no malaria.

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.811
It was also clear that
mosquitoes--there was no clear

00:40:48.811 --> 00:40:54.317
correlation between being bitten
by mosquitoes and developing the

00:40:54.317 --> 00:40:55.349
disease.
 

00:40:55.349 --> 00:41:01.489
And so the dominant theory in
the nineteenth century was of

00:41:01.489 --> 00:41:05.829
miasmatism as the cause of the
disease.

00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:10.557
The unraveling of the
disease--you'll remember this

00:41:10.557 --> 00:41:14.530
man, Patrick Manson,
the father of tropical

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:15.760
medicine.
 

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:20.644
He was also one of the figures
who was most closely associated

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:24.090
in the development of tropical
medicine,

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:27.659
and of the mosquito theory of
transmission,

00:41:27.659 --> 00:41:31.422
which he discovered for a
different disease called

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:32.190
filaria.
 

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:36.239
And then he had the idea that
perhaps if filaria could be

00:41:36.239 --> 00:41:40.579
transmitted by mosquitoes,
possibly malaria could as well.

00:41:40.579 --> 00:41:46.592
And so he joined forces--he
worked, Manson,

00:41:46.592 --> 00:41:48.309
in London.
 

00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:53.449
This is Ronald Ross,
who was a British military

00:41:53.449 --> 00:41:56.690
physician working in India.
 

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.974
Now, India was a tremendously
important place in terms of

00:42:00.974 --> 00:42:01.739
malaria.
 

00:42:01.739 --> 00:42:06.268
Let me just--there was a book
that you might be interested in,

00:42:06.268 --> 00:42:09.309
and that I would recommend to
those of you who are,

00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:14.213
which is the correspondence
between Ronald Ross and Patrick

00:42:14.213 --> 00:42:17.681
Manson,
that led them to the discovery

00:42:17.681 --> 00:42:21.179
of the mosquito theory of
transmission.

00:42:21.179 --> 00:42:27.396
Now Ross worked in India,
and he noted that malaria,

00:42:27.396 --> 00:42:33.735
amongst the general population
of India in the 1890s,

00:42:33.735 --> 00:42:37.150
led to 5,000,000 deaths.
 

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:42.717
And he said that it was the
greatest problem of public

00:42:42.717 --> 00:42:44.610
health in India.
 

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.329
"I think on the
whole," he wrote,

00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:49.969
"that the Indian
population of 400,000,000,

00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:56.409
it causes directly or
indirectly 10,000 deaths a day.

00:42:56.409 --> 00:42:58.489
And apart from this amount of
sickness,

00:42:58.489 --> 00:43:02.117
malaria is, of all diseases,
the most important in

00:43:02.117 --> 00:43:05.005
political,
agricultural and military

00:43:05.005 --> 00:43:07.010
affairs,"
he wrote,

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:10.793
"since it renders large
tracts of fertile land

00:43:10.793 --> 00:43:13.820
uninhabitable,
impedes cultivation,

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.128
planting and public works,
and is the most fierce,

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:22.436
vicious enemy that armies in
the field have to contend

00:43:22.436 --> 00:43:23.329
against.
 

00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:28.498
On the whole I think we're
justified in claiming that the

00:43:28.498 --> 00:43:33.300
malaria question is as important
as famine or bubonic

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.869
plague."
 

00:43:34.869 --> 00:43:42.447
In India, what Ross and Manson
did was to discover--let's go

00:43:42.447 --> 00:43:48.869
back to our picture of the
lifecycle of malaria.

00:43:48.869 --> 00:43:54.324
They traced--through
microscopy, were able to detect

00:43:54.324 --> 00:43:59.780
in the body of the mosquito
after it had bitten,

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:02.510
and they did experiments in
which they--

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:07.398
among not human beings but
birds--and they discovered that

00:44:07.398 --> 00:44:12.545
it was possible to detect the
plasmodia responsible for avian

00:44:12.545 --> 00:44:15.141
malaria,
under the microscope,

00:44:15.141 --> 00:44:17.190
in the body of the mosquito.
 

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:22.114
That was a first major insight,
that the mosquito was in some

00:44:22.114 --> 00:44:23.510
way implicated.
 

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:28.985
But then they went further and
they followed the process by

00:44:28.985 --> 00:44:34.648
which it changed various phases
in the body of the insect and

00:44:34.648 --> 00:44:39.420
reproduced,
and they traced the migration

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:45.829
of the parasite to the biting
apparatus of the mosquito.

00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:50.228
And then they were able to take
healthy birds and have

00:44:50.228 --> 00:44:53.769
mosquitoes,
who were known to be infected,

00:44:53.769 --> 00:44:57.385
feast on them,
and to produce malaria

00:44:57.385 --> 00:45:00.050
experimentally on birds.
 

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.023
And, so, in 1898,
if you were reading this

00:45:03.023 --> 00:45:06.619
correspondence,
there's a eureka moment in

00:45:06.619 --> 00:45:11.907
which Ross announces that he's
discovered the mosquito theory

00:45:11.907 --> 00:45:14.980
of transmission,
and proved it.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:19.411
And he claims that he feels
like Captain Cook,

00:45:19.411 --> 00:45:23.550
the explorer,
or possibly like Napoleon.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:27.518
And he was not,
however, a naturalist,

00:45:27.518 --> 00:45:32.619
and he didn't know about the
speciation of mosquitoes,

00:45:32.619 --> 00:45:36.751
and the mosquitoes he
described, he described as

00:45:36.751 --> 00:45:39.679
dappled,
brindled or light brown.

00:45:39.679 --> 00:45:42.954
He didn't know about the
species of Anopheles

00:45:42.954 --> 00:45:44.139
mosquitoes.
 

00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:48.489
It's at this point that we
should mention then a second

00:45:48.489 --> 00:45:52.052
major figure--
oops, anyway we'll see--it

00:45:52.052 --> 00:45:56.088
doesn't matter--
Giovanni Battista

00:45:56.088 --> 00:46:01.579
Grassi, who was the next figure
in the development of the

00:46:01.579 --> 00:46:08.530
mosquito theory of transmission,
and he does so for human beings.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:14.210
And what he does is he
discovers that it's possible--

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:19.119
in a place called Capaccio he
takes railroad workers,

00:46:19.119 --> 00:46:23.179
in the midst of a major malaria
outbreak in the summer,

00:46:23.179 --> 00:46:26.900
and he introduces one variable
in their lives,

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.335
from a control group of
railroad workers and the

00:46:30.335 --> 00:46:35.494
surrounding peasantry;
and that is that one group he

00:46:35.494 --> 00:46:42.190
has living from dusk until dawn
in well-screened houses;

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:46.858
and this difference protecting
them from the one factor,

00:46:46.858 --> 00:46:51.782
which is from the bites of
mosquitoes, prevents their being

00:46:51.782 --> 00:46:53.820
contracting malaria.
 

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.920
This was one place in which he
did that.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.291
And then he also did a
different experiment,

00:47:01.291 --> 00:47:06.782
which was to use quinine,
which kills malaria parasites

00:47:06.782 --> 00:47:09.630
in the open bloodstream.
 

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:14.289
He gave it prophylactically to
a series of workers,

00:47:14.289 --> 00:47:17.230
as a control group,
in a place like Ostia,

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:21.971
during the summer malaria
season, and found that he could

00:47:21.971 --> 00:47:26.204
protect them as well from
malaria by establishing a

00:47:26.204 --> 00:47:31.369
chemical barrier between the
mosquitoes and human beings.

00:47:31.369 --> 00:47:35.369
And then he took the further
step of actually taking

00:47:35.369 --> 00:47:39.840
mosquitoes who were known to
have feasted on people ill of

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.041
malaria,
and took them to a hospital in

00:47:43.041 --> 00:47:46.170
Rome known as the Santo Spirito
Hospital,

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:52.010
where he had a volunteer on the
second floor who was in a room

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:57.085
where at night they released
hundreds of intentionally

00:47:57.085 --> 00:48:01.907
infected mosquitoes,
and a couple of weeks later

00:48:01.907 --> 00:48:06.672
they had their eureka moment
when he had a spike and a

00:48:06.672 --> 00:48:10.773
temperature of 104,
and they knew that they had

00:48:10.773 --> 00:48:15.219
successfully transmitted malaria
by human experimentation to

00:48:15.219 --> 00:48:19.590
someone who had been healthy
until mosquitoes infected with

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:23.510
the disease had been allowed to
feast upon him.

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:31.139
So, this then happens between
1898 and 1901.

00:48:31.139 --> 00:48:35.855
And this then is a powerful
factor in the development of

00:48:35.855 --> 00:48:37.570
tropical medicine.
 

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:42.539
But it also leads to programs
to combat malaria.

00:48:42.539 --> 00:48:46.409
Having discovered the pathogen
responsible to it,

00:48:46.409 --> 00:48:49.202
the plasmodia,
and the vector,

00:48:49.202 --> 00:48:54.302
female anopheles mosquitoes,
we see the development of

00:48:54.302 --> 00:48:58.360
public health programs to
destroy the disease--

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:04.489
either by attacking the
plasmodia with chemical therapy,

00:49:04.489 --> 00:49:08.423
that is, through quinine;
or by killing mosquitoes,

00:49:08.423 --> 00:49:13.398
that is, vector control--the
idea of possibly being able to

00:49:13.398 --> 00:49:15.199
eradicate malaria.
 

00:49:15.199 --> 00:49:19.425
And next time what I'd like to
do is to follow the practical

00:49:19.425 --> 00:49:23.222
application then of the
discoveries we've talked about

00:49:23.222 --> 00:49:25.835
today,
about the life cycle of

00:49:25.835 --> 00:49:29.090
plasmodia and of anopheline
mosquitoes,

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:32.925
and see how that leads to the
development of public health

00:49:32.925 --> 00:49:33.800
strategies.
 

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:39.525
And I'd like to talk about how
those strategies are being used

00:49:39.525 --> 00:49:44.407
in the real world today to
combat this crisis of this

00:49:44.407 --> 00:49:47.599
dreadful vector-borne disease.
 

00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:53.000

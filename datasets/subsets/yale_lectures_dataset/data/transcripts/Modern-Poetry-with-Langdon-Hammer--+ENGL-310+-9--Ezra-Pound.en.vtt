00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.586
Pound.
How many of you have ever read

00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:11.770
Pound before?
Some? Yes.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.600
Unlike with Frost,
you are unlikely to have read

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.059
much Pound, I think,
up to this point in your

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:28.094
educations,
and probably you are unlikely

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:34.444
to have much of a view of him,
in contrast to Frost or even

00:00:34.444 --> 00:00:39.726
Yeats,
who cuts such a particular and

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:43.450
remarkable public figure.
 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.696
Pound can be hard to put
together, he can be hard to get

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:53.430
a picture of.
What is Pound like?

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.370
What was he like?
 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.756
Well, this is a hard question
for some of the same reasons

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:09.903
that the poems are hard;
that is, Pound's poetry

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:17.494
projects no determinate
identity, no determinate poetic

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:26.069
voice, unlike those distinctive
voices of Yeats and Frost.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:32.256
Instead, in Pound you encounter
a multiplicity of identities,

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:35.040
a multiplicity of voices.
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.450
There's an interesting
contradiction in this.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.500
Pound is a kind of fierce
individualist.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.513
He believes in,
he wants to honor â€“ as a

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:53.288
political thinker and as a poet,
as a reader â€“ he wants to

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:58.769
honor a heroic and sovereign
idea of the individual.

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:02.087
At the same time,
in his writing,

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:06.959
Pound repeatedly divests
himself of identity,

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.480
of particular identity,
in order to enter or to be

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.324
entered by other identities,
other poets,

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:21.229
other voices,
creators, heroes.

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:27.389
This is what he wants to give
us access to as readers.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:32.694
Pound's centrality in modern
poetry repeats the kind of

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:35.150
paradox I'm describing.
 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.859
That is, he is the one poet on
the syllabus whom all the other

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:43.410
poets knew, had some kind of
relationship with,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.340
some kind of contact.
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.169
On the one hand,
Pound was an individual of

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:55.229
extraordinary personal charisma
and force,

00:02:55.229 --> 00:03:00.098
someone who liked to,
and who had the power to tell

00:03:00.098 --> 00:03:05.481
other people what to do,
tell other people what to think

00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:07.229
and what to value.
 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:11.276
On the other hand,
when you study Pound,

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:16.360
you're studying someone
remarkably open to others,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.058
in friendship,
as a reader,

00:03:19.058 --> 00:03:24.208
as a thinker.
He's someone who openly seeks

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:26.620
alliance with others.
 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.143
He had, as we already talked
about in our first lecture,

00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:35.860
an important relationship to
Frost.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.395
You remember Frost speaking of
his sometime friend Pound who

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:42.624
wants to write,
as he puts it,

00:03:42.624 --> 00:03:44.699
"caviare to the crowd"?
 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:49.357
Well, Pound is credited,
as I also suggested,

00:03:49.357 --> 00:03:53.379
with in many ways modernizing
Yeats,

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:00.241
helping Yeats become the
particular voice that he did in

00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:03.360
the teens and twenties.
 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.174
In the Beinecke,
there's a little letter,

00:04:07.174 --> 00:04:12.419
a handwritten pencil letter
from Pound to Hart Crane,

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:15.158
which Hart Crane received when
he was eighteen,

00:04:15.158 --> 00:04:18.433
I think, around your age,
after he had sent his poems to

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:20.160
The Little Review.
 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.780
And this is a letter from Pound
which says about Crane's poems:

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.130
"It is all very egg.
 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.810
There is perhaps better egg.
 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.839
But you haven't the ghost of a
setting hen or an incubator

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:35.530
about you."
 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.050
 
 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.850
I'm not sure what that means.
 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:47.992
But this was a rejection slip,
and Crane kept it all his life,

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:53.732
like a kind of diploma that in
some way he was a member of

00:04:53.732 --> 00:04:59.371
modern poetry because he had
gotten a rejection from Ezra

00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:03.752
Pound.
In fact, Crane's first book,

00:05:03.752 --> 00:05:09.644
if you go over to the Beinecke,
and you turn it over,

00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:11.910
it has a picture.
 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.280
It has a portrait,
not of Hart Crane but of Ezra

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.865
Pound, because it has an ad for
Pound and his book,

00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:23.427
Personae.
And I like this fact because

00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:29.011
it's representative,
I think, of Pound's importance

00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:35.936
and dominance and prominence in
the poetic culture of the 1920s

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:40.606
and '30s.
He was part of the world that a

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:46.517
younger poet like Hart Crane had
to get to know and make his

00:05:46.517 --> 00:05:50.248
place in.
One of the famous books about

00:05:50.248 --> 00:05:53.125
modern poetry,
one by Hugh Kenner,

00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:58.443
is called simply The Pound
Era, as if modern poetry was

00:05:58.443 --> 00:06:00.709
all about Ezra Pound.
 

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:09.069
Ezra Pound, born in Hailey,
Idaho in 1908.

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:14.794
I like it that this wildly
cosmopolitan expatriate

00:06:14.794 --> 00:06:18.650
intelligence was born in Idaho.
 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.380
He left the United States.
 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.750
Oh, he wasn't born in 1908.
 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.300
When was Pound born?
 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.259
He left the United States in
1908.

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.455
Look in your--yes,
he was born in 1885,

00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:38.730
thank you.
He left the U.S.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:45.556
in 1908 and lived mostly in
London where at that point he

00:06:45.556 --> 00:06:52.383
acted as the foreign editor of
Poetry magazine and

00:06:52.383 --> 00:06:58.815
The Little Review,
two Little Magazines that I've

00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:03.995
shown you pictures of and that
were important in bringing

00:07:03.995 --> 00:07:07.509
modern poetry to the United
States.

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.040
Pound is the central figure in
that process.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.731
He goes out and finds and
interprets and explains and

00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:19.782
even, in the case of Imagism,
names the poetry that he is

00:07:19.782 --> 00:07:22.759
bringing to American readers.
 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:26.150
He is the entrepreneur,
if you like,

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.060
behind Imagism and then when
Amy Lowell takes over Imagism.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:37.958
Vorticism becomes his thing and
the magazine Blast

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:41.540
becomes, for a while,
his organ.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.609
He writes manifestos,
he organizes groups,

00:07:46.609 --> 00:07:51.060
all the time abandoning them,
too.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.146
His poem Hugh Selwyn
Mauberley,

00:07:56.146 --> 00:08:02.746
composed in 1920,
looks back on this whole period

00:08:02.746 --> 00:08:10.308
in London and is a kind of
summary of the poetry of this

00:08:10.308 --> 00:08:15.670
period and his involvement in
it.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:21.521
And it is itself a kind of
early model for another great

00:08:21.521 --> 00:08:26.415
poem, The Waste Land,
which Eliot would,

00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:31.310
as he composed it,
bring to Pound to edit.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.340
And we'll talk about that
process in a bit.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.679
In 1924 Pound moved to Italy.
 

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:45.165
There, he became urgently
concerned with economic reform,

00:08:45.165 --> 00:08:50.840
in the United States and in the
West generally.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.842
He is in this period working on
his great poem,

00:08:55.842 --> 00:09:00.627
his long poem which I'll be
discussing today,

00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:03.019
The Cantos.
 

00:09:03.019 --> 00:09:10.185
He became increasingly involved
in Italian Fascism,

00:09:10.185 --> 00:09:17.637
which he found a powerful
vehicle of his own economic

00:09:17.637 --> 00:09:21.220
ideas, in particular.
 

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:27.750
He made broadcasts in support
of Mussolini's government,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:33.923
on Fascist radio in the 1940s,
and in 1945 at the conclusion

00:09:33.923 --> 00:09:38.425
of the War was arrested for
treason by the United States

00:09:38.425 --> 00:09:42.527
Army.
The charge of treason was

00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:50.938
dropped when he was found to be
insane and hospitalized at St.

00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:56.453
Elizabeth's Hospital in
Washington, D.C.,

00:09:56.453 --> 00:10:03.899
where he would in a very
peculiar way hold court,

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:11.700
a great man of letters at the
center of the American capitol,

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:19.370
entertaining Elizabeth Bishop
and other figures whom we will

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.415
read.
At the time of Pound's

00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:29.820
institutionalization,
his poem The Pisan

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.190
Cantos,
a late stage of The

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:37.389
Cantos, was selected as the
first winner of the Bollingen

00:10:37.389 --> 00:10:41.513
Prize,
an award initially given by the

00:10:41.513 --> 00:10:43.879
Library of Congress.
 

00:10:43.879 --> 00:10:49.975
When Pound, traitor to the
nation, was awarded this prize

00:10:49.975 --> 00:10:56.243
for the best American poetry,
an enormous literary and

00:10:56.243 --> 00:11:03.115
cultural controversy sprang up,
which people go on arguing

00:11:03.115 --> 00:11:08.531
about.
Well, here is a poet who by his

00:11:08.531 --> 00:11:15.238
own declaration and example
seems to be a Fascist

00:11:15.238 --> 00:11:19.570
sympathizer, an anti-Semite.
 

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:25.394
Could he write great poetry,
even great poetry that

00:11:25.394 --> 00:11:30.870
expressed Fascistic and
anti-Semitical views?

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.714
If he could write great poetry
of that kind,

00:11:35.714 --> 00:11:38.080
should we honor it?
 

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.913
If he was mad,
is there some way in which his

00:11:43.913 --> 00:11:47.360
poetry might not be mad?
 

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.496
Well, these are questions that
have persisted and as I say

00:11:52.496 --> 00:11:55.559
people go on arguing about them.
 

00:11:55.559 --> 00:12:00.823
The controversy created so much
trouble the Library of Congress

00:12:00.823 --> 00:12:06.001
didn't want anything to do with
the award anymore and it moved

00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:10.052
to Yale,
and the Beinecke Library has

00:12:10.052 --> 00:12:15.902
been administrating this,
arguably the most prestigious

00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:19.259
of poetry prizes ever since.
 

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:22.570
And in fact,
the judging for this year's

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:27.493
award is going strong at the
moment and there will be a new

00:12:27.493 --> 00:12:30.379
winner at the end of the week.
 

00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:37.270
Well, Pound's anti-capitalism,
his economic ideas,

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:45.707
I think, are in some ways the
intellectual origin of both his

00:12:45.707 --> 00:12:53.160
interest in Fascism and the
anti-Semitic views that he

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.165
expresses,
both in poetry and often in

00:12:58.165 --> 00:13:00.990
prose.
Anti-capitalism:

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:07.979
for Pound this derives from
really a specific cultural

00:13:07.979 --> 00:13:10.694
setting;
that is, late

00:13:10.694 --> 00:13:15.753
nineteenth-century American
culture, a culture where,

00:13:15.753 --> 00:13:19.450
as Pound experienced it and saw
it,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.376
art was conceived as a
decorative art,

00:13:22.376 --> 00:13:27.360
subject to the editorial tastes
of popular magazines like The

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.049
Atlantic,
Harper's;

00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:36.937
a culture in which poetry was a
kind of commodity,

00:13:36.937 --> 00:13:44.669
which status destroyed the
potential for originality and

00:13:44.669 --> 00:13:49.730
which subordinated art to money.
 

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.404
When Pound expatriates,
when he leaves the United

00:13:53.404 --> 00:13:56.926
States, he's fleeing not only
America but he's,

00:13:56.926 --> 00:14:01.059
as he understands it,
he's fleeing American money.

00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:06.500
And what he is entering,
what he's going to,

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.700
he conceives as a particular
kind of tradition,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:19.182
a kind of historical community,
which he describes in that

00:14:19.182 --> 00:14:27.149
first quotation on your handout;
a quotation in which Pound

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:35.190
replies in a wonderfully haughty
way to the motto of

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:41.494
Poetry magazine,
a motto that comes from the

00:14:41.494 --> 00:14:45.740
great American poet Whitman:
"To have great poetry,

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.529
there must be great audiences,
too."

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:52.420
To which Pound says,
"It is true that the great

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.409
artist always has a great
audience, even in his lifetime;

00:14:57.409 --> 00:15:02.899
but it is not the vulgo
but rather the spirits of irony

00:15:02.899 --> 00:15:08.120
and of destiny and of humor,
the great authors of the past,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.279
sitting beside him."
 

00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:16.134
Pound, I think,
in an almost literal sense

00:15:16.134 --> 00:15:24.845
conceived of his audience as a
kind of distinguished community

00:15:24.845 --> 00:15:31.700
of readers and writers existing
across time,

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.200
a kind of trans-historical
community of artists;

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.909
ideas that we'll want to
compare with Eliot's ideas of

00:15:39.909 --> 00:15:43.480
tradition, which are related but
a little different,

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.460
next week.
 

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.759
 
 

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:54.928
Let me move to the second
quotation, also from the same

00:15:54.928 --> 00:16:02.054
period, 1914.
Pound says, "There's no use in

00:16:02.054 --> 00:16:10.955
a strong impulse if it is nearly
all lost in bungling

00:16:10.955 --> 00:16:16.090
transmission and technique.
 

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:22.000
This obnoxious word that I'm
always brandishing about means

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.299
nothing but a transmission of
the impulse intact."

00:16:27.299 --> 00:16:33.660
In Pound, there is an emphasis,
as we saw last time in looking

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.039
at his rules for writing Imagist
poetry,

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:42.694
there is an emphasis on the
priority of poetic technique and

00:16:42.694 --> 00:16:45.850
the importance of technical
knowledge.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:50.636
But, as this quotation
suggests, and it's important to

00:16:50.636 --> 00:16:54.610
keep in mind,
technique in Pound is always in

00:16:54.610 --> 00:17:01.273
the service of intensity,
immediacy, or what he calls

00:17:01.273 --> 00:17:07.564
"the impulse."
There are further quotations

00:17:07.564 --> 00:17:13.630
from Pound describing his
technical aims.

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:21.665
As I suggested a few minutes
ago, Pound moves on from Imagism

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:25.549
to what he calls Vorticism.
 

00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:31.806
Now, instead of wanting to get
at a poetry that is centered on

00:17:31.806 --> 00:17:38.268
the image, he imagines a poetry
centered on now "the vortex," as

00:17:38.268 --> 00:17:41.244
he calls it;
and there's a kind of

00:17:41.244 --> 00:17:44.740
definition of the vortex there
in the third quotation.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:50.759
Not so much later he would
replace the idea of the vortex

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:56.349
with another related image,
which is the ideogram.

00:17:56.349 --> 00:18:01.714
We talked about some of Pound's
translations from the Chinese

00:18:01.714 --> 00:18:03.950
and Japanese last time.
 

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:09.553
Pound was interested in Chinese
writing systems as--Well,

00:18:09.553 --> 00:18:14.956
you can imagine how the
ideogram appealed to a poet who

00:18:14.956 --> 00:18:20.359
wanted to imagine the poem as an
image of a thing.

00:18:20.359 --> 00:18:28.444
Here, as Pound understood it,
not always with superb

00:18:28.444 --> 00:18:35.420
scholarly precision,
the Chinese word was,

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:40.591
in fact, an image of a thing,
and this is very much a kind of

00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:45.503
aesthetic ideal for Pound who
wanted language to give us a

00:18:45.503 --> 00:18:50.329
kind of immediate access to the
things of the world.

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:59.480
Well, I asked you to read for
class today one of Pound's poems

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.659
from the teens,
one of his famous poems,

00:19:04.659 --> 00:19:11.341
a poem called "The Seafarer,"
identified in your RIS packet as

00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:14.190
"From the Anglo-Saxon."
 

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.180
I'll read just the beginning of
it for you.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.259
 
 

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:22.500
May I,
for my own self,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:26.102
song's truth reckon,
Journey's jargon,

00:19:26.102 --> 00:19:30.990
how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:34.059
Bitter breast-cares have I
abided,

00:19:34.059 --> 00:19:37.309
Known on my keel many a care's
hold,

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:42.240
And dire sea-surge,
and there I oft spent

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.089
Narrow nightwatch nigh the
ship's head

00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:47.880
While she tossed close to
cliffs.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.900
Coldly afflicted,
My feet were by frost benumbed.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.700
Chill its chains are;
chafing sighs

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.590
Hew my heart round and hunger
begot

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.630
Mere-weary mood.
Lest man know not

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.690
That he on dry land loveliest
liveth,

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.279
List how I, care-wretched,
on ice-cold sea,

00:20:10.279 --> 00:20:13.500
Weathered the winter,
wretched outcast

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:17.540
Deprived of my kinsman;
And so on.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.730
Iambic pentameter?
 

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.280
You've been working on it.
 

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:28.713
No, it's not.
What you're listening to is

00:20:28.713 --> 00:20:30.690
something very different.
 

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:36.559
The sound is rough, like Frost.
 

00:20:36.559 --> 00:20:42.561
And too, like Frost,
in this poetry Pound is writing

00:20:42.561 --> 00:20:47.739
against the beautiful,
sonorous forms of late

00:20:47.739 --> 00:20:51.269
nineteenth-century poetry.
 

00:20:51.269 --> 00:20:54.098
But Pound's poem,
unlike Frost,

00:20:54.098 --> 00:20:59.096
is the very furthest from the
vernacular that we could

00:20:59.096 --> 00:21:03.232
possibly get.
What we have here is Pound

00:21:03.232 --> 00:21:09.075
translating from the Anglo-Saxon
and providing a contemporary

00:21:09.075 --> 00:21:13.750
equivalent of Old English
alliterative verse,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:19.748
a particular verse form;
a dead poetic form you could

00:21:19.748 --> 00:21:24.506
say, although Pound revives it
and, in fact,

00:21:24.506 --> 00:21:30.259
brings it into usage in
twentieth-century poetry.

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:35.555
This verse form--I've given you
John Hollander's helpful

00:21:35.555 --> 00:21:41.524
self-descriptive definition at
the bottom of your handout where

00:21:41.524 --> 00:21:45.277
Hollander says:
The oldest English

00:21:45.277 --> 00:21:48.666
accented meter
Of four, unfailing,

00:21:48.666 --> 00:21:53.270
fairly audible
Strongly struck stresses seldom

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.170
Attended to anything other than
Definite downbeatsâ€¦

00:21:56.170 --> 00:22:00.448
In other words,
in Old English verse you don't

00:22:00.448 --> 00:22:05.539
count syllables.
You just count strong stresses.

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:08.839
And there are,
as a rule, four per line,

00:22:08.839 --> 00:22:11.885
and the lines,
like Hollander's here,

00:22:11.885 --> 00:22:17.299
like Pound's that I just read,
tend to divide in the middle.

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:22.065
There's a caesura that breaks
the line in two,

00:22:22.065 --> 00:22:26.089
and Hollander goes on
describing it.

00:22:26.089 --> 00:22:33.027
In addition to these strong
stresses, the line is held

00:22:33.027 --> 00:22:41.142
together by alliterative links
that join the words strongly and

00:22:41.142 --> 00:22:45.200
audibly across the caesura.
 

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.870
 
 

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.740
Pound is an avant-garde poet.
 

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:53.029
He's an experimentalist.
 

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:57.450
Here we have the strange and
very interesting spectacle of

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:04.736
the self-consciously modernist,
avant-gardist artist writing in

00:23:04.736 --> 00:23:09.309
an archaic, dead poetic form.
 

00:23:09.309 --> 00:23:12.978
In the teens,
Pound is writing a kind of

00:23:12.978 --> 00:23:17.869
experimental poetry that in many
different ways seeks

00:23:17.869 --> 00:23:21.820
alternatives to
nineteenth-century norms of

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:27.229
poetic practice,
seeks alternatives to romantic

00:23:27.229 --> 00:23:32.349
sentiment, poetic diction,
smooth musicality,

00:23:32.349 --> 00:23:38.259
all of the virtues and vices
that you find in early Yeats.

00:23:38.259 --> 00:23:45.035
What he does is open poetry to
a range of styles and forms,

00:23:45.035 --> 00:23:50.643
many of them archaic,
many of them from languages

00:23:50.643 --> 00:23:53.329
outside of English.
 

00:23:53.329 --> 00:23:58.387
You see Pound writing his
version of the ProvenÃ§al

00:23:58.387 --> 00:24:02.130
troubadour song and
canzone.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:07.294
We talked last time about
Pound's version of Chinese or

00:24:07.294 --> 00:24:12.317
Japanese poems.
He writes his own versions of

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:16.299
Roman poetry or here Old
English.

00:24:16.299 --> 00:24:23.871
Through technical means,
through Pound's technique,

00:24:23.871 --> 00:24:30.079
he gains access to cultures and
voices.

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:35.289
He revives past voices,
like the seafarer poet's;

00:24:35.289 --> 00:24:39.730
revives and implicitly
identifies with them.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:47.721
Here is an expatriate poet
writing in the voice of the

00:24:47.721 --> 00:24:53.798
Anglo-Saxon wanderer,
a figure deprived of his

00:24:53.798 --> 00:24:59.450
kinsmen, who is out in the
elements, far from land,

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:03.789
far from his nation and home.
 

00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:11.763
Writing in the voice of the
seafarer, Pound allies himself

00:25:11.763 --> 00:25:17.406
with what is historically prior,
and, in fact,

00:25:17.406 --> 00:25:21.019
in English he allies himself
with what is historically

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:25.529
primary,
with the oldest English poetry.

00:25:25.529 --> 00:25:30.738
Here, he claims it for himself,
carries it forward or,

00:25:30.738 --> 00:25:35.652
as he would put it,
transmits the impulse in an act

00:25:35.652 --> 00:25:39.406
of translation.
Pound's slogan,

00:25:39.406 --> 00:25:45.190
"make it new," a kind of motto
for modernism;

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:52.241
it's important to hear that
injunction, to "make it new," as

00:25:52.241 --> 00:25:58.814
a specifically historical
mission to revive and transmit

00:25:58.814 --> 00:26:02.279
the past in a living way.
 

00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:07.568
The phrase itself,
"make it new," was translated

00:26:07.568 --> 00:26:14.657
from the ancient Chinese and is
itself in that sense an instance

00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:17.470
of what it describes.
 

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:24.331
Pound's conception of the poet
is as one who brings the

00:26:24.331 --> 00:26:30.430
impulse, as he calls it,
forward, across time;

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:35.268
does so in a kind of
imaginative act of seafaring,

00:26:35.268 --> 00:26:37.736
if you like,
leaving home,

00:26:37.736 --> 00:26:40.600
going out, crossing over.
 

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.279
 
 

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:51.569
Pound is a distinctive and,
in a sense, quite peculiar

00:26:51.569 --> 00:26:54.853
thing.
He is a kind of visionary

00:26:54.853 --> 00:26:59.103
scholar.
He is an epic poet of the

00:26:59.103 --> 00:27:02.329
library.
There's a certain kind of

00:27:02.329 --> 00:27:06.932
contradiction in this;
that is, a contradiction or

00:27:06.932 --> 00:27:13.220
tension at any rate between
Pound's drive towards immediacy,

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:23.039
towards his wish to convey an
emotional impulse and the highly

00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:28.190
mediated nature of his vision.
 

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:37.779
Pound's poetry is full of
learned and abstruse reference.

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:39.973
Unlike in The Norton
Anthology,

00:27:39.973 --> 00:27:43.530
if you pick up a volume of
Pound you'll find no footnotes.

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:46.240
He just gives you the thing.
 

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.602
He gives you no help with it
because, I think,

00:27:50.602 --> 00:27:56.030
there is an intention in the
poetry to somehow give you a

00:27:56.030 --> 00:28:02.137
kind of unmediated access to the
materials that Pound is drawing

00:28:02.137 --> 00:28:04.803
on.
He wants us to feel the

00:28:04.803 --> 00:28:09.716
excitement he feels when he sits
down in the library and opens a

00:28:09.716 --> 00:28:12.433
book.
Directness, intensity,

00:28:12.433 --> 00:28:16.714
purity, immediacy:
these are all Pound's aims,

00:28:16.714 --> 00:28:22.422
and he achieves them through an
intensely mediated display of

00:28:22.422 --> 00:28:23.850
technique.
 

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.619
 
 

00:28:27.619 --> 00:28:33.420
Well, you might contrast,
again, Frost.

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:39.784
Frost is always concealing,
as it were, his expertise,

00:28:39.784 --> 00:28:46.389
his technical knowledge,
whereas Pound is always showing

00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:49.590
it.
In the case of "The Seafarer,"

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:53.367
Pound has used Sweet's
Anglo-Saxon Reader,

00:28:53.367 --> 00:28:56.829
his college textbook,
to write this poem.

00:28:56.829 --> 00:28:59.980
It's one he's taken to Europe
with him.

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:05.369
Now, there are several
consequences for all this.

00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:09.948
One: in Pound,
there is the idea that there

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:15.289
are no dead forms,
there are no dead languages.

00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:19.937
There are only derivations,
variations, translations,

00:29:19.937 --> 00:29:25.300
through which the past is
continuously being made present.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:28.460
 
 

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.148
Two: that is,
the past is continuously

00:29:32.148 --> 00:29:37.730
available for those who can
recognize it and seize it,

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:43.181
specifically through technical
powers â€“ technical powers

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:49.207
which yet in the process must be
transcended in order to achieve

00:29:49.207 --> 00:29:53.990
the kind of immediacy and power
that he seeks.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:59.990
In effect, Pound makes
technique a form of inspiration.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:05.029
This is an interesting turn in
literary history.

00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:10.700
The visionary poet in Pound is
a scholar poet.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:16.369
Literary technique is in Pound
a secular means of evoking

00:30:16.369 --> 00:30:22.039
literary inspiration â€“
literary inspiration in the form

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:27.440
of prior literature,
prior literature seen and felt

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.885
as sacred;
as sacred, not as in Milton,

00:30:31.885 --> 00:30:38.835
a divine authority but rather
an authority to be recognized

00:30:38.835 --> 00:30:42.670
and felt and seized in books.
 

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:46.599
The footnote,
the scholarly index,

00:30:46.599 --> 00:30:52.553
the library archive:
these are the muses that Pound

00:30:52.553 --> 00:30:56.400
appeals to.
And the used bookstore:

00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:00.609
these are the places that his
poems come from.

00:31:00.609 --> 00:31:07.049
The result is a body of work
that is always returning us,

00:31:07.049 --> 00:31:10.500
its readers,
to its sources.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:19.815
In the very first lecture I
referred to what I see as two

00:31:19.815 --> 00:31:28.841
very general and different,
competing drives or forces in

00:31:28.841 --> 00:31:33.187
modern poetry:
one centripetal,

00:31:33.187 --> 00:31:41.590
the other centrifugal â€“ one a
kind of will on the part of

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:47.529
modern poets to order poetry
itself;

00:31:47.529 --> 00:31:55.083
on the other hand,
a will to order the world,

00:31:55.083 --> 00:32:00.442
order society.
The artist must be concerned

00:32:00.442 --> 00:32:04.359
with art's own problems,
on the one hand.

00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:08.154
On the other hand,
in Pound and in others,

00:32:08.154 --> 00:32:12.874
the artist is a kind of
legislator, to use Shelley's

00:32:12.874 --> 00:32:18.164
image.
He has a truth that he wants to

00:32:18.164 --> 00:32:24.500
promulgate that will order
society properly.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:30.154
Pound embodies these two
drives, as I'm calling them,

00:32:30.154 --> 00:32:34.069
more clearly,
better than anybody,

00:32:34.069 --> 00:32:38.458
and they're part of his
interest and power,

00:32:38.458 --> 00:32:43.160
and some of the challenge that
he gives us,

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:49.455
both aesthetic challenges and
moral and political ones,

00:32:49.455 --> 00:32:53.069
as we think about his career.
 

00:32:53.069 --> 00:32:57.502
On the one hand,
in Pound there's a kind of

00:32:57.502 --> 00:33:04.150
drive to identify that which is
most essential to literature and

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:09.109
to tell Pound's readers how to
write poems.

00:33:09.109 --> 00:33:13.714
This is the Pound who wrote
those remarks about Imagism that

00:33:13.714 --> 00:33:15.900
we talked about last time.
 

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.999
On the other hand,
there is the Pound who wants to

00:33:19.999 --> 00:33:25.312
extend the reach of literature,
who wants to--who writes

00:33:25.312 --> 00:33:30.522
letters to statesmen,
who goes on Fascist radio to

00:33:30.522 --> 00:33:34.670
tell the world how things should
be.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:39.843
This is also the poet who in
his poem The Cantos

00:33:39.843 --> 00:33:44.633
wished to create a poem that
would, as he calls it,

00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:49.420
include history.
What an ambition, right?

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:53.317
Extraordinary.
So, on the one hand,

00:33:53.317 --> 00:33:58.277
you have the poet of "In a
Station of the Metro," the

00:33:58.277 --> 00:34:03.850
shortest poem in modern poetry,
and then you have the poet of

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:07.386
The Cantos,
the longest poem in modern

00:34:07.386 --> 00:34:11.269
poetry.
Pound is both of these things.

00:34:11.269 --> 00:34:15.610
And these impulses that we see
in that poem,

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:19.949
in that short poem and in that
long poem,

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:26.979
they don't just compete in him,
they exist, I think,

00:34:26.979 --> 00:34:31.389
in some kind of collaboration.
 

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:38.225
"In a Station of the Metro"
identifies the image as the

00:34:38.225 --> 00:34:43.946
primary unit of poetry,
and in Pound's practice it

00:34:43.946 --> 00:34:49.845
becomes a kind of building block
for larger forms and for the

00:34:49.845 --> 00:34:53.084
epic itself.
He says here,

00:34:53.084 --> 00:34:58.105
on your handout,
in a letter to Joyce:

00:34:58.105 --> 00:35:05.570
"I have begun an endless poem,
of no known category.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:12.579
Phanopoeia or something or
other, all about everythingâ€¦ I

00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:16.809
wonder what you will make of
it."

00:35:16.809 --> 00:35:21.277
Well "phanopoeia" means
specifically image-making,

00:35:21.277 --> 00:35:26.657
and you can understand The
Cantos as they unfold as a

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:33.555
kind of series of Imagist poems,
as the image becomes this

00:35:33.555 --> 00:35:41.942
fertile principle that produces
and generates more and more

00:35:41.942 --> 00:35:46.570
images, more and more voices.
 

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:54.325
The Cantos are,
he says, "of no known

00:35:54.325 --> 00:35:58.237
category."
It's true, it's hard to

00:35:58.237 --> 00:36:02.646
identify the genre of The
Cantos, although I've been

00:36:02.646 --> 00:36:04.849
calling it an epic so far.
 

00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:10.998
There's a sense in which in
each canto Pound is inventing

00:36:10.998 --> 00:36:17.256
the form of the poem anew,
inventing it in response to the

00:36:17.256 --> 00:36:20.440
demands of new materials.
 

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.221
The way to understand this
great and maddening and somewhat

00:36:25.221 --> 00:36:30.250
mad poem, which is one of the
great works of modern poetry,

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:35.295
from which we're reading just
the smallest fragment--one way

00:36:35.295 --> 00:36:40.170
to understand it is as the
record of one man's reading,

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:46.379
one man's encounter with many
voices and his incorporation of

00:36:46.379 --> 00:36:51.449
them and engagement and
conversation with them.

00:36:51.449 --> 00:36:56.456
The title of the poem is worth
perhaps dwelling on for a

00:36:56.456 --> 00:37:01.190
moment: The Cantos â€“
"the songs," really.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.119
That's what it means.
 

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:06.247
The title foregrounds literary
activity itself,

00:37:06.247 --> 00:37:10.203
foregrounds acts of singing,
which are here,

00:37:10.203 --> 00:37:14.584
as Pound imagines it,
a kind of renewable practice or

00:37:14.584 --> 00:37:20.059
process that can't be reduced to
a particular image or symbol.

00:37:20.059 --> 00:37:22.742
So, in that sense,
this poem is unlike The

00:37:22.742 --> 00:37:25.059
Waste Land or The
Bridge,

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:30.444
which produced these specific,
central symbols around which

00:37:30.444 --> 00:37:35.179
all of the poem's ideas and
images are organized.

00:37:35.179 --> 00:37:40.619
Pound instead gives us
something more like a process.

00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:45.443
Pound, as I say,
spoke of it as a poem including

00:37:45.443 --> 00:37:48.656
history.
Well, this makes it sound as if

00:37:48.656 --> 00:37:52.678
the poem were larger than
history, somehow a kind of frame

00:37:52.678 --> 00:37:56.769
for history that would help us
understand and order it.

00:37:56.769 --> 00:38:01.380
Well, maybe Pound wished this
but that's not what he produced.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.196
The poem lacks an organizing
view of history,

00:38:05.196 --> 00:38:10.139
such as you find in Milton or
Virgil or Homer or Dante.

00:38:10.139 --> 00:38:13.134
It would be,
therefore, much more accurate

00:38:13.134 --> 00:38:17.079
to call it a poem that is in
some sense continuous with

00:38:17.079 --> 00:38:19.489
history, that's like history.
 

00:38:19.489 --> 00:38:23.845
In that sense,
a poem that is structurally

00:38:23.845 --> 00:38:27.175
unbounded.
This is, I think,

00:38:27.175 --> 00:38:33.705
the view of history it
projects: history not as a story

00:38:33.705 --> 00:38:39.630
of progress or Yeatsian
apocalypse and cycles,

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:43.415
but history rather as something
like the poem itself,

00:38:43.415 --> 00:38:46.909
something that accumulates and
repeats itself,

00:38:46.909 --> 00:38:51.380
with variations and without a
definite aim in view.

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:56.062
History, in this sense,
is something that can be

00:38:56.062 --> 00:39:01.244
entered but not begun,
and it can't ever be completed

00:39:01.244 --> 00:39:05.739
either.
And this is true of this poem:

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:08.440
And then went down to the
ship,

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.319
Set keel to breakers,
forth on the godly sea,

00:39:12.319 --> 00:39:15.434
and
We set up mast and sail on that

00:39:15.434 --> 00:39:18.670
swart ship,
Bore sheep aboard her,

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.574
and our bodies also
Heavy with weeping,

00:39:22.574 --> 00:39:27.599
and winds from sternward
Bore us onward with bellying

00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:30.073
canvas,
Circe's this craft,

00:39:30.073 --> 00:39:32.380
the trim-coifed goddess.
 

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:35.840
Then sat we amidships,
wind jamming the tiller,

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.739
Thus with stretched sail,
we went over sea till day's

00:39:39.739 --> 00:39:42.053
end.
Sun to his slumber,

00:39:42.053 --> 00:39:46.836
shadows o'er all the ocean,
Came we then to the bounds of

00:39:46.836 --> 00:39:49.582
deepest water,
To the Kimmerian lands,

00:39:49.582 --> 00:39:53.244
and peopled cities
Covered with close-webbed mist,

00:39:53.244 --> 00:39:55.909
unpierced ever
With glitter of sun-rays

00:39:55.909 --> 00:40:00.360
Nor with stars stretched,
nor looking back from heaven

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:04.369
Swartest night stretched over
wretched men there.

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:11.200
The ocean flowing backward,
came we then to the place

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:17.071
Aforesaid by Circe.
When I was a student I said to

00:40:17.071 --> 00:40:22.563
my teacher, "I don't really get
Pound and it's not very

00:40:22.563 --> 00:40:24.699
beautiful either."
 

00:40:24.699 --> 00:40:28.682
And he said,
"Well, take a look at this" and

00:40:28.682 --> 00:40:33.683
produced those lines I just
read, which are magnificent

00:40:33.683 --> 00:40:39.596
heroic poetry.
They begin with that word,

00:40:39.596 --> 00:40:43.733
"and."
They begin with the conjunction

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:46.288
"and."
They begin with the conjunction

00:40:46.288 --> 00:40:48.409
and without a grammatical
subject.

00:40:48.409 --> 00:40:51.620
"And then went down to the
ship."

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.080
Who went down to the ship?
 

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.719
Pound doesn't say.
 

00:40:56.719 --> 00:41:04.764
He introduces the poem with an
action, an action that is itself

00:41:04.764 --> 00:41:07.230
part of a series.
 

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:13.293
The action that we are being
introduced to here is Odysseus'

00:41:13.293 --> 00:41:18.431
journey to hell in search of
Tiresias, the prophet,

00:41:18.431 --> 00:41:21.719
among the souls of the dead.
 

00:41:21.719 --> 00:41:26.944
He wants to learn--Odysseus
wants to learn his future course

00:41:26.944 --> 00:41:29.070
and decide how to act.
 

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.848
Odysseus, we learn,
as the poem unfolds,

00:41:33.848 --> 00:41:40.097
is the first speaker Pound
accesses and gives to us,

00:41:40.097 --> 00:41:45.979
which is to say that we're
reading a translation,

00:41:45.979 --> 00:41:50.840
again.
And how does Odysseus speak?

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:56.276
Not like Tennyson's Ulysses in
sonorous blank verse,

00:41:56.276 --> 00:42:02.139
but rather, as I think you
could hear readily enough,

00:42:02.139 --> 00:42:08.960
in the Anglo-Saxon alliterative
verse form of "The Seafarer."

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.500
Pound is doing something very
interesting and exhilarating.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.624
He is translating what he
conceives of as the oldest

00:42:17.624 --> 00:42:25.201
passage in The Odyssey,
that most archaic of poetry in

00:42:25.201 --> 00:42:33.634
the West, and translating it
using that poetry most archaic

00:42:33.634 --> 00:42:38.754
in English,
the language and rhythms and

00:42:38.754 --> 00:42:42.059
patterning of "The Seafarer."
 

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:46.955
This is a kind of overlay in
technique, again,

00:42:46.955 --> 00:42:52.829
of Old English alliterative
verse and Homer's Greek.

00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:59.104
These linguistic forms in the
poem are merged as if by a kind

00:42:59.104 --> 00:43:04.019
of parataxis,
which I talked about last time,

00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:10.066
to produce what Pound calls â€“
when he's writing about the

00:43:10.066 --> 00:43:15.466
image â€“ a complex,
a complex of elements that are

00:43:15.466 --> 00:43:19.925
held together in an instant;
an instant that,

00:43:19.925 --> 00:43:24.020
as he understood it,
transcends space and time

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:27.266
limits.
This is all set out again in

00:43:27.266 --> 00:43:29.519
the doctrine of the image.
 

00:43:29.519 --> 00:43:34.851
And we talked about another
instance of that kind of

00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:41.541
cultural overlay of materials in
the little poem "In a Station of

00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:45.476
the Metro."
Contrast what Pound is doing

00:43:45.476 --> 00:43:49.280
here with what Joyce does in
Ulysses.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:55.721
In Ulysses Joyce is,
in a sense, carrying Homer's

00:43:55.721 --> 00:43:59.469
text into contemporary Dublin.
 

00:43:59.469 --> 00:44:02.699
He's naturalizing it and
modernizing it.

00:44:02.699 --> 00:44:07.139
Pound, in a sense,
is doing just the opposite.

00:44:07.139 --> 00:44:12.782
He is going back,
and indeed here the sea flows

00:44:12.782 --> 00:44:19.406
backward and it takes us back
to, again, primary terms:

00:44:19.406 --> 00:44:23.699
archaic Greek,
archaic English.

00:44:23.699 --> 00:44:31.541
He is seeking to re-appropriate
the heroic mode through

00:44:31.541 --> 00:44:37.639
translation in yet a
contemporary idiom.

00:44:37.639 --> 00:44:42.834
This is a kind of raising of
the dead, a kind of journey to

00:44:42.834 --> 00:44:47.761
the literary and cultural
underworld that brings Pound's

00:44:47.761 --> 00:44:52.150
adventure as a poet into line
with Odysseus'.

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.195
And you can see,
in other words,

00:44:54.195 --> 00:44:58.023
what Odysseus is doing now as
he goes to the underworld and

00:44:58.023 --> 00:45:01.719
seeks prophetic speech from
Tiresias as a version of what

00:45:01.719 --> 00:45:05.349
Pound is doing as he seeks to
translate the Greek at the

00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:07.329
inception of his epic.
 

00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:11.615
Pound's own display of
technique you could understand

00:45:11.615 --> 00:45:15.901
as a kind of version of the
ceremony to honor and pay

00:45:15.901 --> 00:45:19.606
tribute,
through blood sacrifice,

00:45:19.606 --> 00:45:26.512
that Odysseus practices here in
the passages that follow as he

00:45:26.512 --> 00:45:31.039
induces Tiresias to appear and
speak.

00:45:31.039 --> 00:45:36.485
Literary tradition here has
itself taken the place of the

00:45:36.485 --> 00:45:41.931
transcendental source of
authority that was the classical

00:45:41.931 --> 00:45:44.460
or the Christian muse.
 

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:50.222
Here Pound, in a sense,
turns back upon poetry itself

00:45:50.222 --> 00:45:55.263
as a sacred source;
here, at a moment in the epic

00:45:55.263 --> 00:45:58.912
where invocation would
ordinarily stand,

00:45:58.912 --> 00:46:01.719
at that point of inception.
 

00:46:01.719 --> 00:46:09.660
Here, technique is imagined as
a kind of process of translation

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:16.832
through which speech from
elsewhere is brought forward in

00:46:16.832 --> 00:46:23.619
time and in some sense carried
across the waters.

00:46:23.619 --> 00:46:26.837
Again there's a sense of
contradiction,

00:46:26.837 --> 00:46:28.699
however, or tension.
 

00:46:28.699 --> 00:46:34.543
Pound wants to elicit speech
from the dead to make the

00:46:34.543 --> 00:46:37.519
tradition's language new.
 

00:46:37.519 --> 00:46:39.659
He wants to transmit the
impulse.

00:46:39.659 --> 00:46:43.903
He also insists,
however, cannily and

00:46:43.903 --> 00:46:50.150
provocatively on the mediated
quality of his words.

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:59.093
Tiresias speaks at the top of
page 370, towards the end of the

00:46:59.093 --> 00:47:02.500
poem.
He says to Odysseus when he

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.900
sees him:
"A second time?

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.710
why?
man of ill star,

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.699
"Facing the sunless dead and
this joyless region?

00:47:09.699 --> 00:47:14.194
"Stand from the fosse [that is,
the ditch], leave me my bloody

00:47:14.194 --> 00:47:15.900
bever
"For soothsay."

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.943
And I stepped back [and that
"I" there is the "I" of

00:47:20.943 --> 00:47:24.542
Odysseus],
And he strong with the blood,

00:47:24.542 --> 00:47:28.335
said then: "Odysseus
"Shalt return through spiteful

00:47:28.335 --> 00:47:31.699
Neptune, over dark seas,
"Lose all companions."

00:47:31.699 --> 00:47:37.033
And then Anticlea [Odysseus'
mother]

00:47:37.033 --> 00:47:40.679
came.
And then a remarkable thing

00:47:40.679 --> 00:47:44.190
happens.
Someone says:

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:49.437
Lie quiet Divus.
I mean [and now the "I" is the

00:47:49.437 --> 00:47:52.309
"I" of Pound,
the narrator,

00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:54.769
the speaker,
not Odysseus],

00:47:54.769 --> 00:47:59.118
that is Andreas Divus,
In officina Wecheli,

00:47:59.118 --> 00:48:03.656
1538, out of Homer.
This is Pound stepping into the

00:48:03.656 --> 00:48:06.796
poem saying, "I have been
translating all of this from

00:48:06.796 --> 00:48:11.098
Homer,
and I have been using the Latin

00:48:11.098 --> 00:48:17.419
translation of Andreas Divus
that I bought in a Paris

00:48:17.419 --> 00:48:21.779
bookstand.
And this has been my source for

00:48:21.779 --> 00:48:26.800
this text, and it is Divus that
I have, the translator,

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:32.991
that has been my muse and who
has been speaking here through

00:48:32.991 --> 00:48:35.510
Tiresias, if you like.
 

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:39.750
And it's his soul that is laid
back and to rest."

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:44.737
And at this moment Pound
continues, now speaking of

00:48:44.737 --> 00:48:48.922
Odysseus in the third person,
and he says:

00:48:48.922 --> 00:48:52.838
"And he sailed,
by Sirens and thence outward

00:48:52.838 --> 00:48:55.570
and away / and unto Circe."
 

00:48:55.570 --> 00:49:00.449
Finally, the journey continues.
 

00:49:00.449 --> 00:49:04.024
Here, again,
Odysseus' journey being

00:49:04.024 --> 00:49:09.948
analogized implicitly to the
journey that the translator is

00:49:09.948 --> 00:49:15.260
affecting as he brings the text
forward in time,

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:19.912
across from oral culture to
print, from Greek to Latin and

00:49:19.912 --> 00:49:22.769
Latin to English and Old
English.

00:49:22.769 --> 00:49:28.165
And then in a remarkable
efflorescence that ends this

00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:33.249
First Canto, with a macronic
display of languages,

00:49:33.249 --> 00:49:36.420
Pound says:
Venerandam,

00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:41.317
In the Cretan's phraseâ€¦
Again, he's opened his book,

00:49:41.317 --> 00:49:46.644
and at the back of Divus's
translation he's found the

00:49:46.644 --> 00:49:52.380
Homeric hymns and now he's going
to give them to us:

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.780
â€¦with the golden crown,
Aphrodite,

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:59.261
Cypri munimenta sortita est,
mirthful, orichalchi,

00:49:59.261 --> 00:50:01.824
with golden
Girdles and breast bands,

00:50:01.824 --> 00:50:05.585
thou with dark eyelids
Bearing the golden bough of

00:50:05.585 --> 00:50:08.000
Argicida.
So that:

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.667
Colon.
The poem ends here with a

00:50:12.667 --> 00:50:18.684
prayer to the goddess of beauty,
Aphrodite, who is invoked in

00:50:18.684 --> 00:50:23.182
Greek and Latin;
who is brought forward and who

00:50:23.182 --> 00:50:26.639
is named Argicida,
"killer of the Greeks,

00:50:26.639 --> 00:50:32.536
slayer of the Greeks,"
presumably because she has had

00:50:32.536 --> 00:50:39.510
her hand in the abduction of
Helen and the war in Troy.

00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:47.280
Here, Pound has invoked the
goddess in these ways and then

00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:55.460
concluded his Canto with the
interesting grammatical form,

00:50:55.460 --> 00:51:00.119
"So that," and the interesting
punctuation, a colon.

00:51:00.119 --> 00:51:05.971
In effect, if the poem began
with "and," it now ends with "so

00:51:05.971 --> 00:51:11.822
that," where the colon is a kind
of gateway through which the

00:51:11.822 --> 00:51:17.514
rest of the poem,
and implicitly following Homer,

00:51:17.514 --> 00:51:21.159
the rest of history will pass.
 

00:51:21.159 --> 00:51:26.326
And here Pound has established
his poem and established his own

00:51:26.326 --> 00:51:32.174
role as, in some sense,
a mediator, conducting a

00:51:32.174 --> 00:51:41.429
process by which the sources of
the past are brought forward

00:51:41.429 --> 00:51:47.169
into the future,
relaying what he calls "the

00:51:47.169 --> 00:51:51.869
impulse," and in the process
"making it new."

00:51:51.869 --> 00:51:57.747
Well, let's stop and we will go
on to, as I say,

00:51:57.747 --> 00:52:03.000
the related and different
poetry of T.S.

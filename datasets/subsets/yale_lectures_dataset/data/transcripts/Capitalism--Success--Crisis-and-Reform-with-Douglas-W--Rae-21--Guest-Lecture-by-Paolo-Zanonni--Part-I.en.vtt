00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:05.583
Prof: We're very
privileged today and Wednesday

00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:10.750
to have my dear and good friend
of thirty-five years standing,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.053
Paulo Zanonni,
who has for quite a long time

00:00:16.053 --> 00:00:22.976
been a partner at Goldman Sachs,
and is indeed the second most

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:27.380
senior member of the Goldman
Sachs partnership,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.620
by age.
 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:37.424
Today we're going to do a very
informal class with facts on the

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:41.400
slide sheet as background.
 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:49.044
We're going to have Paolo talk
about how Goldman actually works

00:00:49.044 --> 00:00:55.263
at seeing from the inside,
which will be a rare

00:00:55.263 --> 00:01:02.533
opportunity to see the most
remarkable American business

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.968
firm from the interior.
 

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:11.328
It's truly a great opportunity
for all of us.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:15.945
Then on Wednesday,
Paolo will do a major European

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:21.281
case managed by Goldman Sachs,
and a case which was in

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:24.950
progress when he was here a year
ago,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.760
and it has now come to its
fruition.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.209
The slide set for that is
posted--that will be a little

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:35.660
more formal than today,
but still informal in style.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.530
Please help me welcome Paolo
Zanonni.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:48.120
Paolo let's talk about you to
begin with.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.950
You are Northern rather than a
Southern Italian?

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.400
Paolo Zanonni:
 Center-north,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.690
yeah.
 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.385
Prof: Yes,
and is there any significance

00:01:57.385 --> 00:01:58.910
in North/South in Italy?
 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.805
Paolo Zanonni:
 Yes, I think there's

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:02.840
significance.
 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.094
Prof: Are there--how
many people of Southern Italian

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:07.329
descent in the room?
 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.550
Sort of?
 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.770
Student:  Sicily.
 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.370
Prof: Okay.
 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.620
How do most Northern Italians
look on that distinction?

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.845
Paolo Zanonni:
 They look at that

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:25.979
distinction like the South was
almost a colony,

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:33.169
occupied or conquered in 1861,
and never really--

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:40.870
sort of conquered but that
never really assimilated.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.578
Prof: Assimilated;
the North is the industrial and

00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:48.720
business part of Italy,
is that a fair statement?

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.474
Paolo Zanonni:
 The North is the most

00:02:51.474 --> 00:02:55.216
industrialized part,
yes, but in the South you

00:02:55.216 --> 00:03:00.656
have--I don't think you want to
go into the Italian political

00:03:00.656 --> 00:03:04.312
economic system,
but in the South you have

00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:07.921
certain areas that have a
reasonably high level of

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.468
industrialization.
 

00:03:09.468 --> 00:03:14.044
Prof: Paolo you came
from--you first arrived in the

00:03:14.044 --> 00:03:15.810
states in what year?
 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.220
Paolo Zanonni:  1973.
 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.939
Prof: 1973 and you came
as a graduate student in the

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.250
Yale Political Science
Department.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.750
I remember it well.
 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.919
Paolo Zanonni:  Yeah.
 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.745
Prof: Paolo became an
outstanding touch football

00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:28.050
player.
 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.568
Paolo Zanonni:
 Too small for that.

00:03:31.568 --> 00:03:33.750
Prof: No,
no you were really good at it.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.139
You even picked up the brawl
language of the game.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.657
Paolo Zanonni:
 That's--size there is

00:03:41.657 --> 00:03:42.360
different.
 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.280
Prof: The--and you left
Yale?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.568
Paolo Zanonni:  In 1978.
 

00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:53.259
Prof: In 1978 to go to
work for Johnny at Fiat?

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:54.949
Paolo Zanonni:  Yep.
 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.538
Prof: Tell us a little
about that stint.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:01.000
Paolo Zanonni:
 That's the--

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.241
I worked for the Chairman of
the Board and also the owner of

00:04:06.241 --> 00:04:11.659
the controlling stake at Fiat
for about five or six years--

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.400
Prof: Right.
 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.449
Paolo Zanonni:
 --and after,

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:19.497
I became--I wanted to do some
more operational experience and

00:04:19.497 --> 00:04:23.285
so I went to manage the
international business

00:04:23.285 --> 00:04:26.230
development department at Fiat.
 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.269
In that capacity I spent about
five years in Washington,

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:36.690
here, because we had asked
Chairman of Fiat U.S.A.,

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.089
because we had some issues with
the then U.S.

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:47.016
Government, and after,
I spent two years in Moscow in

00:04:47.016 --> 00:04:48.839
1990 and 1991.
 

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:51.440
Prof: What were you
looking at in Moscow?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.480
Paolo Zanonni:
 In Moscow I was looking to

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.446
acquire the largest Russian
manufacturer of automobiles that

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:03.536
the government--
first the government of the

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:06.252
Soviet Union,
and second the government of

00:05:06.252 --> 00:05:09.564
the Russia Republic,
when the Soviet Union was

00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:12.098
dismembered,
or disappeared,

00:05:12.098 --> 00:05:16.480
I decided to buy
&gt;

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.526
That company has been
established by Fiat as a wholly

00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:24.495
owned company from--
wholly owned by the Soviet

00:05:24.495 --> 00:05:27.620
state about fifteen years
earlier,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.266
and so it was based on Fiat
technology and both Gorbachev

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:34.589
first and Yeltsin afterward
wanted to privatize,

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:37.019
and I was sent there to try to
buy it,

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:39.800
unsuccessfully.
 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.083
Prof: Ultimately--you
ultimately walked away from the

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:44.529
deal as I understand it?
 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.129
Paolo Zanonni:  Yeah.
 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.415
We walked away because there
was no deal for the simple

00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:50.319
reason that the management and
the region,

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:58.454
some area region wanted to
become owners of the factory and

00:05:58.454 --> 00:06:07.290
have ownership of the asset and
100% control on the profits,

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.588
and on the cash flow,
and so they were definitely--

00:06:10.588 --> 00:06:14.480
they were not willing to sell
it to a foreigner.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.959
Prof: So that's a
non-starter.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.610
Then after the stint in Russia?
 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.394
Paolo Zanonni:
 I did a couple years more

00:06:22.394 --> 00:06:25.240
at Fiat, and after,
I decided to join Goldman.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.600
Prof: Then you joined
Goldman?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.620
Paolo Zanonni:  Yeah.
 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.636
Prof: And you joined
them as--what was your title at

00:06:30.636 --> 00:06:31.259
that time?
 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:32.850
Paolo Zanonni:
 At that time,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.879
Goldman did not have managing
directors,

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:39.120
as opposed to--so it only had
vice president--

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.050
sorry it had
associate--analyst,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.119
associate,
and vice president of various

00:06:48.119 --> 00:06:51.290
degrees of seniority and I
joined them as a--

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:56.569
the last degree of vice
president, and after,

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:02.810
I became managing director in
1997 and a partner in 2000.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:10.350
Prof: Let's now turn to
Goldman.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.120
I'm talking to these people now
for a second.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.370
You'll remember the stark
contrast we've drawn between the

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.918
ownership for--
of joint stock corporations,

00:07:22.918 --> 00:07:27.639
publicly traded joint stock
corporation on the one hand,

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.959
and a partnership on the other.
 

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:34.500
Can somebody help us out by
naming the two or three

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:40.129
variables on which those two are
most importantly different?

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:45.740
Okay I'll settle for one
variable.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.100
Student:  Liability.
 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.648
Prof: Okay limited
liability in the case of the

00:07:53.648 --> 00:07:57.769
joint stock corporation;
good.

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:03.060
Another?
 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.759
Student:  Liquidity.
 

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:08.129
Prof: Liquidity;
huge difference.

00:08:08.129 --> 00:08:11.620
You can't sell your partnership
in Goldman.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.379
Another?
 

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:22.004
Student:  Partnership
income is not taxed separate

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:25.620
from the
&gt;

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.432
Prof: The partnership is
invisible in the tax codes so

00:08:29.432 --> 00:08:32.259
that the proceeds--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:37.142
 The individuals get taxed,
the individual partners get

00:08:37.142 --> 00:08:37.899
taxed.
 

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:40.206
Prof: The individuals
get taxed, okay but it in effect

00:08:40.206 --> 00:08:41.360
saves one layer of taxation.
 

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.629
Yes.
 

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:47.538
Student:  The right or
ability to make management

00:08:47.538 --> 00:08:48.610
decisions.
 

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.015
Prof: Okay so that in
the case of a partnership

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:57.256
everyone has a management job,
all the partners have

00:08:57.256 --> 00:08:58.918
management jobs.
 

00:08:58.918 --> 00:09:03.817
Whereas, with a corporation you
have centralized management

00:09:03.817 --> 00:09:09.558
where the board appoints a chief
executive and a chief executive,

00:09:09.558 --> 00:09:12.645
at least in theory,
is responsible for appointing

00:09:12.645 --> 00:09:15.134
everyone else,
and finally,

00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:20.830
how did the two do as media for
raising capital?

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.590
The mechanism for raising
capital;

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.870
back to Paolo.
 

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:37.822
Student:  A joint stock
corporation is much more

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.850
scalable.
 

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.389
It's got greater scalability;
you can raise a lot more

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:43.440
capital than a partnership.
 

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.190
Prof: Okay.
 

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:50.123
The joint stock corporation was
created as a mechanism for

00:09:50.123 --> 00:09:55.144
gathering up capital in very
large quantities and it's good

00:09:55.144 --> 00:09:56.009
at it.
 

00:09:56.009 --> 00:09:58.700
Now back to Paolo.
 

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.592
Historically,
Goldman was straight-forwardly

00:10:01.592 --> 00:10:02.668
a partnership?
 

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:05.419
Paolo Zanonni:
 It was a partnership up to

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:08.916
1999, but you have read the case
study with the IPO of Goldman

00:10:08.916 --> 00:10:09.490
Sachs.
 

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:16.416
Prof: And it was an
extraordinary partnership with

00:10:16.416 --> 00:10:23.095
an extraordinary record of
success in nearly all of its

00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:24.580
history.
 

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.190
Is that a fair statement?
 

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.830
Paolo Zanonni:
 In 1999 with--it's a fair

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.759
statement.
 

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:35.798
There are a couple of
exceptions--1929.

00:10:35.798 --> 00:10:38.798
Prof: Tough on a lot of
people.

00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:41.082
Paolo Zanonni:
 Yes, tough on a lot of

00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:41.548
people.
 

00:10:41.548 --> 00:10:44.889
Especially tough--almost killed
the partnership.

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:51.264
There is another exception
which is interesting for your

00:10:51.264 --> 00:10:58.448
class because usually investment
bank and securities firms tend

00:10:58.448 --> 00:11:02.821
to do badly,
tend to be very cyclical,

00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:08.200
and to do badly on the downturn
and well on the upturn.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.928
There was one exception,
one exception,

00:11:10.928 --> 00:11:12.558
at least as far as Goldman is
concerned,

00:11:12.558 --> 00:11:16.833
which is very interesting,
everybody else was doing very

00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:21.341
well in 1994 but Goldman was
doing very badly and it almost

00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:23.440
killed the partnership.
 

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:31.291
As badly as--almost as badly in
1928, and as badly as the crisis

00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:35.029
or &gt;
 

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:40.385
and the reason for that,
and that again,

00:11:40.385 --> 00:11:46.428
mixed blessings,
one of the facts of life.

00:11:46.428 --> 00:11:51.279
The reason why Goldman was
doing very badly was because

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:55.952
Goldman has tried very
aggressively to do proprietary

00:11:55.952 --> 00:12:00.629
trading,
especially in fixed income,

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:07.519
and that was not really part of
the Goldman culture.

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:18.538
The risk management and the
trading organization of Goldman

00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:24.975
was very bad,
and in 19--toward the end of

00:12:24.975 --> 00:12:31.024
1994, second half of 1994,
Goldman started having losses

00:12:31.024 --> 00:12:34.230
at that time that were
staggered,

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.690
especially for a partnership.
 

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.830
Almost the--the capital of the
partnership was almost wiped

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.789
out,
and actually that's where the

00:12:44.789 --> 00:12:50.038
firm had the remarkable ability
of select--

00:12:50.038 --> 00:12:55.090
a group of leaders that
knew--that came from trading,

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.840
knew proprietary trading very
well,

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:01.100
even if some of them were not
born in the same--

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:05.166
in that same organization,
and were able to restructure

00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:09.384
the trading philosophy and
especially the risk management

00:13:09.384 --> 00:13:14.052
function of Goldman and probably
one of the reasons why Goldman

00:13:14.052 --> 00:13:18.120
has done not so badly when the
credit crunched,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:25.683
is because of that overhaul of
the risk management and of the

00:13:25.683 --> 00:13:30.475
trading format style,
and control of the autonomy of

00:13:30.475 --> 00:13:31.240
the traders.
 

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.450
Actually the two people that
did it,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.880
one was Corzine who was a
managing partner when the firm

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.631
went public,
and the other was Lloyd

00:13:40.631 --> 00:13:42.509
Blankfein who is CEO today.
 

00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:46.470
Prof: Corazine may be
available for--

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.900
Paolo Zanonni:
 If he could come back to

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.429
Goldman.
 

00:13:49.429 --> 00:13:51.000
Prof: Kidding.
 

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.428
Paolo Zanonni:
 I think it he wants too.

00:13:53.428 --> 00:14:00.738
Prof: The mood--just
notice the style of which Paolo

00:14:00.738 --> 00:14:03.509
just said something.
 

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:12.558
He said Goldman has done fairly
well in the current crisis.

00:14:12.558 --> 00:14:16.110
Now that's a huge
understatement;

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:20.769
Goldman has blown the doors off
the current crisis.

00:14:20.769 --> 00:14:24.881
Paolo Zanonni:
 End of 2008 wasn't a nice

00:14:24.881 --> 00:14:25.668
period.
 

00:14:25.668 --> 00:14:28.402
Prof: It was an ugly
period, but compared with all

00:14:28.402 --> 00:14:31.721
its competitors,
in this and in many other

00:14:31.721 --> 00:14:35.928
matters, Goldman has been
absolutely tops,

00:14:35.928 --> 00:14:43.316
and part of the culture is not
to--chest thumping is not the

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:45.320
Goldman style.
 

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.418
There's a very understated
style that emerges,

00:14:49.418 --> 00:14:52.788
and which Paolo,
I think, embodies.

00:14:52.788 --> 00:14:59.120
Now the move to a
corporation--corporate ownership

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:05.450
form has an obvious upside in
raising capital,

00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:11.508
but an apparent downside in
changing the incentives for top

00:15:11.508 --> 00:15:16.609
management in a way that might,
at first blush,

00:15:16.609 --> 00:15:22.083
seem likely to undermine the
cultural strengths of the

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:24.769
historical partnership.
 

00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:26.320
Paolo Zanonni:  Yeah.
 

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.511
Prof: Why don't I shut
up for quite a while now and

00:15:31.511 --> 00:15:37.070
let's get you talking about how
that has been accomplished and

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.149
how it works,
and somewhere or another we

00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:46.754
ought to talk about how people
are recruited to the partnership

00:15:46.754 --> 00:15:50.370
and to leadership roles in the
firm,

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:55.595
and how that might relate to
the style of management that you

00:15:55.595 --> 00:15:57.250
get with Goldman.
 

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.019
Paolo Zanonni:
 I'm sure that you are--I'm

00:16:00.019 --> 00:16:03.596
sure that in Doug's course you
have gone through it and parties

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:05.500
in the case that I have read.
 

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.538
The two advantages of a
partnership,

00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:11.798
especially in the investment
banking world,

00:16:11.798 --> 00:16:18.288
and a securities firm how it
might be is one that as opposed

00:16:18.288 --> 00:16:23.570
to the joint stock corporation
in which Doug--

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.274
that Doug discussed with you,
in a partnership there is no

00:16:27.274 --> 00:16:29.940
split between management and
ownership.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:35.327
The owners of the capital of
the firm are also the managers

00:16:35.327 --> 00:16:39.825
of the company,
and so that's a--creates a set

00:16:39.825 --> 00:16:45.004
of incentives but by not
distinguishing between provider

00:16:45.004 --> 00:16:49.996
of capital and the people that
have the control of the

00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:52.538
operation of the firm.
 

00:16:52.538 --> 00:16:57.562
In Goldman, every generation of
partners and leaders have always

00:16:57.562 --> 00:17:01.470
been convinced that this was a
great advantage.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.160
The other advantage that you
have is that--

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:10.611
and this is an advantage
especially in investment banking

00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:15.056
and securities firm,
which are people business,

00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:18.540
they have no--
if you look at these companies

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.817
they are remarkable in the
amount of sales of revenues that

00:17:22.817 --> 00:17:26.460
they have,
they have no fixed capital.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.480
They have no buildings,
most of the buildings are

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.086
leased,
they have no plant and

00:17:32.086 --> 00:17:37.497
equipment, they have no patents,
it's just a people's business

00:17:37.497 --> 00:17:42.211
and so when you are running a
people's business one of your

00:17:42.211 --> 00:17:47.250
core competencies has got to be
the ability of coordinating the

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.638
behavior to those people
3,000/4,000/20,000 and Goldman

00:17:51.638 --> 00:17:56.759
has only been convinced that the
partnership structure,

00:17:56.759 --> 00:18:05.097
it's ideal to coordinate the
behavior of the top echelon of

00:18:05.097 --> 00:18:06.680
the firm.
 

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:11.395
So the real challenge that
Goldman was facing when Goldman

00:18:11.395 --> 00:18:16.609
decided to go public was to try
to combine the advantages of the

00:18:16.609 --> 00:18:21.278
joint stock corporation,
especially in raising permanent

00:18:21.278 --> 00:18:24.280
capital,
because the partnership capital

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.598
is not permanent.
 

00:18:25.598 --> 00:18:29.769
It's limited,
but if you are very successful,

00:18:29.769 --> 00:18:34.126
the limitations are not so much
on the size as they are on the

00:18:34.126 --> 00:18:38.200
availability on the capital for
a long period of time,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.507
because of course you can put
restrictions on the partners on

00:18:42.507 --> 00:18:46.240
taking away the capital when
they become limited,

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.249
but those restrictions will
just prolong their ability to

00:18:50.249 --> 00:18:51.608
take capital out.
 

00:18:51.608 --> 00:18:55.026
If not, nobody would like to be
a partner, if the capital cannot

00:18:55.026 --> 00:18:55.838
be taken out.
 

00:18:55.838 --> 00:19:00.593
Goldman tried to--the then
leadership of Goldman tried to

00:19:00.593 --> 00:19:05.771
combine the advantages of the
partnership as far as having the

00:19:05.771 --> 00:19:10.586
owner management--
to get the owners managers to

00:19:10.586 --> 00:19:16.578
manage the company and the
ability to coordinate behavior.

00:19:16.578 --> 00:19:20.974
What Goldman tried to do and is
a unique form of corporate

00:19:20.974 --> 00:19:25.294
governance, is the partnership
that is also a joint stock

00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:26.220
company.
 

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.272
For instance,
a title of partner was not

00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:33.624
eliminated,
and Goldman built a structure

00:19:33.624 --> 00:19:40.471
in which partners are rewarded
and incentivized in a different

00:19:40.471 --> 00:19:44.400
way than the other stockholders.
 

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:51.348
The other thing that Goldman
decided to do was,

00:19:51.348 --> 00:19:55.130
which is unusual in a joint
stock company,

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:57.263
and you won't find it in any
other partnership that has

00:19:57.263 --> 00:20:01.913
become a joint stock company,
was to maintain the structure

00:20:01.913 --> 00:20:08.422
of the selection of leadership;
i.e., the selection of the

00:20:08.422 --> 00:20:15.460
partners almost as it was before
it became a joint stock company.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.222
Prof: Maybe too--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:20:18.222 --> 00:20:21.689
 So what you have--
let me try to--what you have is

00:20:21.689 --> 00:20:27.368
that you have the legal form of
a joint stock liability company

00:20:27.368 --> 00:20:30.848
imposed into an organization
that,

00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:34.190
as organizational structure,
and institutional government,

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.643
except at the top,
has maintained the same

00:20:37.643 --> 00:20:42.780
institution and the same type of
leadership selection that you

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:48.548
had in the partnership--
let's say partnership pre-IPO.

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:51.192
Prof: Okay,
so let's talk about this

00:20:51.192 --> 00:20:54.655
leadership selection process
beginning with the entering

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:56.230
classes of employees.
 

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:00.121
Paolo Zanonni:
 Usually when you enter

00:21:00.121 --> 00:21:04.818
Goldman you are given a class,
like you are given a class when

00:21:04.818 --> 00:21:11.470
you went to Yale,
you are the class of 2007/2008.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.930
Prof: We designate them
by the year.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:16.920
Paolo Zanonni:
 At the end that's correct.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.088
We designate it by the year in
which they start.

00:21:19.088 --> 00:21:24.843
There is some sort of courses
in which you are generally

00:21:24.843 --> 00:21:31.327
considered for partnership once
you have spent a fair amount of

00:21:31.327 --> 00:21:36.231
time in the firm,
and once you have been--you

00:21:36.231 --> 00:21:40.279
have done a stint as a managing
director.

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:52.009
When your class is up for
partnership there--

00:21:52.009 --> 00:21:53.880
Prof: How big are these
classes, more or less?

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.493
Paolo Zanonni:
 It depends,

00:21:57.493 --> 00:22:03.079
but let's say that they are a
few hundred people.

00:22:03.079 --> 00:22:05.068
Prof: 500 maybe?
 

00:22:05.068 --> 00:22:07.011
Paolo Zanonni:
 No, a little less

00:22:07.011 --> 00:22:09.318
because--
Prof: 400?

00:22:09.318 --> 00:22:12.192
Paolo Zanonni:
 Between 400 and 200--it

00:22:12.192 --> 00:22:15.384
also depends because,
you know, the partnership has

00:22:15.384 --> 00:22:17.940
been--it's not--there is no
erasure.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.273
When we went public the
partnership--the partners were

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:22.910
about 200 ten years ago.
 

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:26.269
There were still less than 300
three years ago,

00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:29.848
or four years ago,
now there are more than 400.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:32.838
There will be a lot less in
2010.

00:22:32.838 --> 00:22:36.702
Prof: Okay,
so you've got these groups of a

00:22:36.702 --> 00:22:40.880
few hundred and at a certain
point it comes time--

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.078
Paolo Zanonni:
 It comes time to be

00:22:42.078 --> 00:22:42.460
considered.
 

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.703
For someone that has done--that
they have had normal career,

00:22:45.703 --> 00:22:47.519
it comes time to be considered.
 

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:55.997
The way the selection works is
the partners of each division

00:22:55.997 --> 00:23:04.188
make two or three lists of all
the candidates of their own

00:23:04.188 --> 00:23:09.328
division,
an A list, a B list,

00:23:09.328 --> 00:23:11.519
and a C list.
 

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:16.063
The A list is the best
candidate, the B list is the

00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:19.970
candidate that are somewhere in
between,

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.890
and the C list is the
candidates that are not--

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.858
that do not have a lot of
chances in that particular year.

00:23:25.858 --> 00:23:30.894
The partnership selection gets
done every two years,

00:23:30.894 --> 00:23:35.240
even years,
2000/2002/2004/2006/2008/2010.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:43.098
Once these selections--when the
first selection has been done,

00:23:43.098 --> 00:23:51.029
what the firm does is takes a
group of people and charge them

00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:58.032
with the task of asking the
community of mostly of the

00:23:58.032 --> 00:24:03.318
professionals about the
candidates,

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:09.818
and so there are a group of
people that conduct rigorous--

00:24:09.818 --> 00:24:14.540
reasonably rigorous interviews
among everyone that has worked

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.798
with everyone.
 

00:24:15.798 --> 00:24:17.983
A large number of the
people--of the professionals

00:24:17.983 --> 00:24:20.170
that have worked with the
partner's candidate,

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:25.308
be they more senior peers,
or more junior,

00:24:25.308 --> 00:24:30.690
to try to gauge the quality of
that individual,

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:34.766
and even more,
the quality of that individual

00:24:34.766 --> 00:24:38.368
vis-a-vis,
the group that is being

00:24:38.368 --> 00:24:40.118
considered as partner.
 

00:24:40.118 --> 00:24:45.025
This is a process that sounds
easy, but it's a process that

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:47.140
takes about two months.
 

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.489
Prof: If I remember our
conversation correctly,

00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:56.250
the firm insists on people
making pair wise comparisons?

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:57.303
Paolo Zanonni:
 The first insists on

00:24:57.303 --> 00:25:00.192
people make--
doing a qualitative analysis,

00:25:00.192 --> 00:25:03.936
and after making--
make a ranking of everybody

00:25:03.936 --> 00:25:05.556
they know,
first, second,

00:25:05.556 --> 00:25:06.828
third, fourth,
and fifth;

00:25:06.828 --> 00:25:10.710
and in certain cases making
pair wise.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.548
When there are two candidates
that are in a similar position,

00:25:13.548 --> 00:25:20.328
making pair wise comparison,
which is a nice--

00:25:20.328 --> 00:25:24.088
which is an old way to do
leadership selection.

00:25:24.088 --> 00:25:26.618
Because my understanding--but
it my--

00:25:26.618 --> 00:25:35.583
it's an understanding is that
it was reasonably well used in

00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:42.420
the Catholic Church orders on
the twelfth--

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.519
eleventh centuries.
 

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:47.883
Actually there is someone that
proposed that in electing the

00:25:47.883 --> 00:25:52.394
Pope, the Pope had to be elected
doing pair wise comparison of

00:25:52.394 --> 00:25:53.798
the candidates.
 

00:25:53.798 --> 00:25:57.958
Prof: Well did the Roman
Catholic Church is one of the

00:25:57.958 --> 00:26:01.770
few organizations with more
distinguished administrative

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.920
history than Goldman Sachs.
 

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.846
Paolo Zanonni:
 I don't know one of the

00:26:05.846 --> 00:26:06.788
few, but definitely.
 

00:26:06.788 --> 00:26:10.403
I think that Goldman
consciously or unconsciously

00:26:10.403 --> 00:26:14.923
copied some of the--at least
some of the criteria used by the

00:26:14.923 --> 00:26:16.430
Catholic Church.
 

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.148
Prof: As you listen to
this, think about what this

00:26:20.148 --> 00:26:23.670
process would do to your
thinking if you were a junior

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.528
person at Goldman Sachs.
 

00:26:25.528 --> 00:26:33.150
This is all designed to shape
and mold a certain kind of

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:38.970
person--of persona and
management style.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.730
Paolo Zanonni:
 And behavior--

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.380
Professor Douglas W.
 

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.121
Paolo Zanonni:
 And behavior in your daily

00:26:44.121 --> 00:26:44.519
business.
 

00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:49.019
Prof: So--and you
mentioned in our conversation

00:26:49.019 --> 00:26:54.368
this morning an element of the
process called cross roughing.

00:26:54.368 --> 00:26:56.157
Paolo Zanonni:
 The cross roughing is the

00:26:56.157 --> 00:26:57.108
one you just mentioned.
 

00:26:57.108 --> 00:27:00.559
Prof: Is there a bridge
player in the room?

00:27:00.559 --> 00:27:02.519
Cross roughing is a bridge term?
 

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:04.185
Paolo Zanonni:
 I'll try to find out what

00:27:04.185 --> 00:27:04.859
it means exactly.
 

00:27:04.859 --> 00:27:06.368
I have no idea.
 

00:27:06.368 --> 00:27:11.930
Prof: Is there not one
bridge player in this room?

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:13.140
That's an interesting fact.
 

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.377
I think it--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:27:14.377 --> 00:27:15.890
 Lots of poker players but
very few bridge players.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:19.460
Prof: What's cross
roughing in this process?

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.980
Paolo Zanonni:
 It is a process of a group

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:27.088
of people selected to search
about the--it's the one that

00:27:27.088 --> 00:27:28.848
I've just described.
 

00:27:28.848 --> 00:27:32.348
That search about the qualities
of the various candidates.

00:27:32.348 --> 00:27:36.380
Prof: But it's
from--they're not in the same--

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.529
Paolo Zanonni:
 They're not in the same

00:27:37.529 --> 00:27:37.809
division.
 

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:39.549
Professor Douglas W.
 

00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.910
Rae:  --their division.
 

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:40.515
Paolo Zanonni:
 They are not in the same

00:27:40.515 --> 00:27:40.660
division.
 

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.420
They belong to another division.
 

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.777
Of course when you look at an
organization you have to think

00:27:45.777 --> 00:27:47.200
about the organization.
 

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.691
I'm getting to theoretical,
sorry too abstract,

00:27:49.691 --> 00:27:52.833
you have to think about the
organization in two dimensions,

00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:54.348
vertical and horizontal.
 

00:27:54.348 --> 00:27:58.962
If you take the divisions they
are like the business in your

00:27:58.962 --> 00:28:03.420
normal industrial organization
and they cut vertically.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.463
If you take the partnership it
cuts the organization

00:28:06.463 --> 00:28:07.240
horizontal.
 

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:12.567
If you want to have a very
effective organization you

00:28:12.567 --> 00:28:18.817
should have a good blend and a
two mix of horizontal cleavages

00:28:18.817 --> 00:28:24.222
let's say and vertical ones,
so the way the selection to the

00:28:24.222 --> 00:28:27.186
partnership is done,
because of course you cannot

00:28:27.186 --> 00:28:30.078
have a group of people that look
at 500 candidates,

00:28:30.078 --> 00:28:32.660
or 200 candidates,
you do it by division.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.578
The first selection is done by
division.

00:28:35.578 --> 00:28:38.502
When you do the least,
the least are done by the

00:28:38.502 --> 00:28:41.378
division,
but afterward since you--since

00:28:41.378 --> 00:28:45.496
the people that will do the
selection are the gatekeeper to

00:28:45.496 --> 00:28:49.400
a horizontal cleavage in a
horizontal organization,

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:54.518
they are not--that gate are not
kept by people from the same

00:28:54.518 --> 00:28:57.391
division,
but they are kept by people

00:28:57.391 --> 00:29:01.325
from another division because
you are moved to a horizontal

00:29:01.325 --> 00:29:04.648
organization that should
coordinate the top of the

00:29:04.648 --> 00:29:06.818
various vertical divisions.
 

00:29:06.818 --> 00:29:10.387
Prof: So this is a
way--in part of checking the

00:29:10.387 --> 00:29:14.318
tendency of divisions of the--
Paolo Zanonni:  Silos

00:29:14.318 --> 00:29:17.318
Prof:
&gt;

00:29:17.318 --> 00:29:18.759
Paolo Zanonni:
 Becoming silosis.

00:29:18.759 --> 00:29:21.326
Prof: Silos--I heard
last week a great expression to

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:22.928
this,
for a frog at the bottom of the

00:29:22.928 --> 00:29:25.231
well,
the sky is very small,

00:29:25.231 --> 00:29:30.380
and that's certainly true in
many organizations right,

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.409
where people get into their
little parts and they're not

00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:36.218
seeing what other people are
seeing across the other

00:29:36.218 --> 00:29:36.990
divisions.
 

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.987
Paolo Zanonni:
 Not only,

00:29:38.987 --> 00:29:42.788
and having gone through a fair
amount of restructuring in my

00:29:42.788 --> 00:29:45.453
professional life,
both in an industrial

00:29:45.453 --> 00:29:48.366
organization--
in a partnership and in an

00:29:48.366 --> 00:29:52.740
investment bank that was a
limited liability company,

00:29:52.740 --> 00:30:00.306
when you get to restructuring
it is very difficult to make a

00:30:00.306 --> 00:30:07.359
rational decision if the
organization is mostly based on

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:14.969
vertical division,
because the vertical logic

00:30:14.969 --> 00:30:20.636
limits to some extent--
not to some extent,

00:30:20.636 --> 00:30:25.945
limits to a major extent,
the horizontal movement of

00:30:25.945 --> 00:30:27.630
individuals.
 

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:33.608
So you tend to consider them
only on a vertical scale,

00:30:33.608 --> 00:30:36.512
and when on the contrary,
you are trying to restructure

00:30:36.512 --> 00:30:39.038
the organization or change the
organization,

00:30:39.038 --> 00:30:42.720
or reduce the number or develop
new business units,

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.960
you have to be able to cut
across a vertical division,

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.048
because if not,
you utilize your manpower

00:30:49.048 --> 00:30:51.185
badly,
and you give your people a

00:30:51.185 --> 00:30:52.660
limited set of choice.
 

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.710
They can only move either up or
down,

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.696
but not sideways,
or the move sideways becomes

00:30:57.696 --> 00:30:59.675
difficult,
and if the move sideways

00:30:59.675 --> 00:31:02.821
becomes very difficult,
it becomes very difficult for

00:31:02.821 --> 00:31:06.924
the organization to follow new
business opportunities because

00:31:06.924 --> 00:31:08.838
those tend to be lateral.
 

00:31:08.838 --> 00:31:12.650
Its increase in scope,
not the increase in depth.

00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:19.619
Sorry we tend to become too
abstract, sorry.

00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:20.548
I'm sorry.
 

00:31:20.548 --> 00:31:26.328
Prof: What are the
qualities that are most

00:31:26.328 --> 00:31:29.338
important to cultivate?
 

00:31:29.338 --> 00:31:32.997
Students, you've seen the
fourteen commandments in the

00:31:32.997 --> 00:31:33.480
case?
 

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.430
Paolo Zanonni:
 Fourteen business

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:36.078
principles.
 

00:31:36.078 --> 00:31:38.690
Prof: Business
principles, seen from inside,

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:44.188
commandments seen from
outside--what are we trying to

00:31:44.188 --> 00:31:49.173
achieve here,
the behavior of the partnership

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:54.170
and those who aspire to be in
the partnership?

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:57.779
What would be the top two or
three qualities?

00:31:57.779 --> 00:32:06.640
Paolo Zanonni:
 A reasonable degree of

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:18.589
autonomy and independence,
but without getting too

00:32:18.589 --> 00:32:24.671
independent--
without pushing the independent

00:32:24.671 --> 00:32:29.470
to some extreme that it gets
disruptive for the organization,

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:35.914
so if you want you try to
strike a balance between

00:32:35.914 --> 00:32:40.442
independence,
creativity, and conformity,

00:32:40.442 --> 00:32:45.200
and historically I think
Goldman has a premium to some

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.970
extent on conformity versus
creativity.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:54.406
I think that there are a fair
amount of innovations in which

00:32:54.406 --> 00:33:00.028
Goldman has come second or third
and other firms have had--

00:33:00.028 --> 00:33:03.558
have been a lot more creative,
or somewhat more creative,

00:33:03.558 --> 00:33:09.656
so you try to strike that
balance and of course one of the

00:33:09.656 --> 00:33:15.647
characteristic of that balance
is the adherence to a very

00:33:15.647 --> 00:33:19.819
reasonably straight belief
system,

00:33:19.819 --> 00:33:22.220
or corporate culture.
 

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:26.185
Prof: How about chest
thumping and conspicuous display

00:33:26.185 --> 00:33:26.980
of wealth?
 

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.942
Paolo Zanonni:
 Chest thumping definitely

00:33:29.942 --> 00:33:30.509
is out.
 

00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:34.342
A conspicuous display of wealth
I would say, consider the

00:33:34.342 --> 00:33:38.174
standard of the industry is not
too bad, but consider the

00:33:38.174 --> 00:33:40.160
standard of the industry.
 

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:44.880
If you look at it from the
outside the industry,

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.902
it's hard to judge,
but it seeing it from the

00:33:47.902 --> 00:33:51.145
inside,
at least its frowned upon,

00:33:51.145 --> 00:33:55.752
it's not considered--
actually it's sanctioned to

00:33:55.752 --> 00:33:56.930
some extent.
 

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.857
Prof: Well, and--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:33:59.857 --> 00:34:00.460
 Precisely.
 

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:02.298
Prof: --and it can
actually, if I'm not mistaken,

00:34:02.298 --> 00:34:07.500
damage a Goldman career if you
are sort of wildly ostentatious

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:12.699
and pick up $10,000 restaurant
tabs and that sort of thing.

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:14.885
Paolo Zanonni:
 Yeah, it usually--you

00:34:14.885 --> 00:34:16.309
usually don't do it twice.
 

00:34:16.309 --> 00:34:22.208
Prof: So Goldman--
Paolo Zanonni:

00:34:22.208 --> 00:34:24.380
 What is the--let me think
about, for a moment,

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.768
about another characteristic.
 

00:34:25.768 --> 00:34:33.835
Within the limits of the
adherence to a straight belief

00:34:33.835 --> 00:34:37.893
system,
and I know the two things seem

00:34:37.893 --> 00:34:43.646
contradictory,
it also pushes you to be an

00:34:43.646 --> 00:34:53.556
entrepreneurial because de
facto partners run their own

00:34:53.556 --> 00:34:56.320
business unit.
 

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:07.489
The levels of hierarchy are
very, very, very short.

00:35:07.489 --> 00:35:14.117
The organization is very flat,
and one of the reasons why it's

00:35:14.117 --> 00:35:19.550
flat is it's trying to foster
entrepreneurship,

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:24.110
especially in the partners,
because,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.179
see, the business in which
Goldman operates,

00:35:27.179 --> 00:35:28.900
the industry in which Goldman
operates,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.268
and you will see it,
I'll to give some examples in

00:35:31.268 --> 00:35:35.050
the printout that you have,
changes very, very quickly.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:39.467
For instance if you take a
picture--we don't give those

00:35:39.467 --> 00:35:41.922
details for many,
many reasons,

00:35:41.922 --> 00:35:45.360
one of which is they change too
often.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.277
If you take the
thirty-six--let's say thirty

00:35:48.277 --> 00:35:51.670
major business lines of Goldman
five years ago,

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:54.199
they are not the same as what
they are today,

00:35:54.199 --> 00:36:01.751
so--because the environment
changes so fast that if you

00:36:01.751 --> 00:36:05.423
are--
if you still try to operate and

00:36:05.423 --> 00:36:09.554
maximize,
or be efficient in the business

00:36:09.554 --> 00:36:13.427
of yesterday,
or of this morning,

00:36:13.427 --> 00:36:17.237
mostly you are--
so if you are a good manager

00:36:17.237 --> 00:36:20.550
maybe you are a bad interpreter
and you are missing new

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:24.172
opportunities of the changes and
the changes the environment

00:36:24.172 --> 00:36:24.969
creates.
 

00:36:24.969 --> 00:36:29.579
What the firm is trying to do
is to have global leaders that

00:36:29.579 --> 00:36:32.860
more or less think along similar
lines,

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:38.344
but that are able to capture
new opportunities and new

00:36:38.344 --> 00:36:40.000
business line.
 

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.246
Let's take--let's for
instance--I'll start to make

00:36:42.246 --> 00:36:45.300
some examples;
we run the risk of being too

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.130
abstract.
 

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.887
Let's take, for instance,
I'm sure that some of you,

00:36:50.887 --> 00:36:54.900
most of you,
are familiar with the crisis of

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:59.380
the savings and loan association
of the U.S.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.449
at the end of the 1980s.
 

00:37:01.449 --> 00:37:07.903
Before that crisis Goldman
Sachs had never done a real

00:37:07.903 --> 00:37:12.409
estate principal investment,
never.

00:37:12.409 --> 00:37:18.353
Didn't even own the building
where they were because they

00:37:18.353 --> 00:37:24.507
thought that there were no
capabilities inside the firm for

00:37:24.507 --> 00:37:26.949
making investments.
 

00:37:26.949 --> 00:37:31.206
Actually when they--what was it
National Trust,

00:37:31.206 --> 00:37:34.815
or whatever,
what was the trust that the

00:37:34.815 --> 00:37:38.730
federal government--
Prof: RTC.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:40.050
Paolo Zanonni:  Yeah.
 

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.976
When they started--when the
RTC, or at least the national

00:37:41.976 --> 00:37:44.860
struggle,
the federal owner of all the

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.148
real estate property,
if you remember,

00:37:48.148 --> 00:37:52.873
most of the crisis originated
from the loans that the savings

00:37:52.873 --> 00:37:56.615
and loan association had done,
especially for real estate

00:37:56.615 --> 00:38:00.061
developers,
so of course the federal

00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:04.554
authority that ran--
the bureaucrats,

00:38:04.554 --> 00:38:10.021
in good sense,
that ran that authority started

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:16.460
selling a lot of real estate
cheap all over the United

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.920
States.
 

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:23.690
It was obvious that there was a
business opportunity there,

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.420
but it was also obvious that
Goldman didn't know about how to

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.858
do it,
because I mean IPOs,

00:38:29.858 --> 00:38:32.960
rate defense,
trading of stock--

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.489
of loans, yes,
but never real estate.

00:38:37.489 --> 00:38:42.014
An exceedingly smart person,
who by the way happens to be a

00:38:42.014 --> 00:38:45.670
Yale graduate,
saw the opportunity,

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:50.114
saw the lack of capability,
and decided to form a

00:38:50.114 --> 00:38:53.210
partnership with someone that
knew a lot about real estate all

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.949
over the United States and
didn't have any capital.

00:38:55.949 --> 00:38:59.260
Goldman started buying real
estate,

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:03.679
and real estate loans,
for themselves--

00:39:03.679 --> 00:39:06.510
or for ourselves and for
investors,

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:13.407
and they--the massive
investment history of Goldman in

00:39:13.407 --> 00:39:17.920
real estate,
both real estate asset and real

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.833
estate loans,
started then just because of

00:39:20.833 --> 00:39:23.516
the opportunity--
because of the opportunity

00:39:23.516 --> 00:39:26.670
offered by this trust
corporation that was selling a

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:30.447
large amount of real estate,
obviously very cheap and the

00:39:30.447 --> 00:39:33.913
ability of one of the partners
to see that there was an

00:39:33.913 --> 00:39:37.083
opportunity,
but that inside the firm there

00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:40.514
was no capability and
understanding which one was

00:39:40.514 --> 00:39:43.159
cheap and which one was not
cheap.

00:39:43.159 --> 00:39:45.516
It seemed cheap but maybe it's
too expensive,

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:48.139
but it would have been a bad
investment anyway.

00:39:48.139 --> 00:39:51.327
And at the end,
the partner that we had got

00:39:51.327 --> 00:39:54.389
tired,
he made too much money and--but

00:39:54.389 --> 00:39:58.764
he had transferred enough
knowledge to the partners and we

00:39:58.764 --> 00:40:02.679
bought it out and made
&gt;

00:40:02.679 --> 00:40:05.800
The same is true with our huge
private equity.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:10.699
We--when I joined the firm we
didn't do much private equity.

00:40:10.699 --> 00:40:13.630
We did it on behalf of clients,
we advised them when they are

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.659
buying or selling companies,
but we didn't do it on our own.

00:40:16.659 --> 00:40:20.094
On the contrary,
immediately after the crisis of

00:40:20.094 --> 00:40:22.184
2000,
the dot com crisis,

00:40:22.184 --> 00:40:26.146
we started seeing an
opportunity and started seeing

00:40:26.146 --> 00:40:30.742
an opportunity that you were
going to make a lot more money

00:40:30.742 --> 00:40:34.782
if you did it on your own than
if you are advised by

00:40:34.782 --> 00:40:36.210
Blackstone.
 

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:40.222
A lot of banks saw it,
however, this is a very

00:40:40.222 --> 00:40:44.574
interesting--
I forgot when--a lot of banks

00:40:44.574 --> 00:40:47.869
saw it,
but they decided not to do it

00:40:47.869 --> 00:40:50.880
for one very basic and valid
reason.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:56.422
The fact that if you do private
equity you start competing with

00:40:56.422 --> 00:41:00.266
your clients,
and that is supposed to be the

00:41:00.266 --> 00:41:04.289
sin number one in a service
organization.

00:41:04.289 --> 00:41:10.413
However, the hubris of Goldman
was such that Goldman believed

00:41:10.413 --> 00:41:16.842
that they were smart enough and
good enough to be able to manage

00:41:16.842 --> 00:41:18.679
the companies.
 

00:41:18.679 --> 00:41:22.090
It was a conscious decision,
there was a debate,

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.190
I remember it because I was
part of the debate,

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:28.579
I was not part unfortunately of
the debate of going public,

00:41:28.579 --> 00:41:30.920
but I was--I was on the outside.
 

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.929
Actually I was--can we joke?
 

00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:37.065
I was actually cheated because
I thought I was going to be in

00:41:37.065 --> 00:41:39.842
the next partnership,
and so the partnership was

00:41:39.842 --> 00:41:44.059
going public in 1999 and I was
up for election in 2000,

00:41:44.059 --> 00:41:48.849
the big prize was postpone or
snatched to a limited,

00:41:48.849 --> 00:41:51.250
so actually--
Prof: Pretty good prize

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:51.880
as we all know.
 

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.608
Paolo Zanonni:
 Yeah it was a very good

00:41:54.608 --> 00:41:57.639
prize, but I was part of the
private equity one.

00:41:57.639 --> 00:42:02.884
Prof: Can I get you to
talk for a minute about how

00:42:02.884 --> 00:42:07.192
Goldman manages its
relationships with power in

00:42:07.192 --> 00:42:11.500
government and other branches of
society,

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.960
not just in the states but
worldwide.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.155
Paolo Zanonni:
 As me and you have

00:42:16.155 --> 00:42:20.760
discussed,
I think that investment banking

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:28.541
is a business where culture is
very important and in all of you

00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:33.940
that are going to be here on
Wednesday,

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:40.090
you'll see that when I speak
about Enel/Endesa take over,

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:43.050
the financial variables are
important,

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:46.092
but I will say that the
variables that determine winning

00:42:46.092 --> 00:42:49.409
or losing sometime,
what we call soft variables,

00:42:49.409 --> 00:42:52.860
but have little to do with
prize and finance.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:59.119
For a global firm that operates
in this business it is very,

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:01.543
very difficult,
if not impossible,

00:43:01.543 --> 00:43:05.655
to be able to understand the
complexities of the business

00:43:05.655 --> 00:43:08.079
culture in which it operates.
 

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:13.574
Your best way to understand
those complexities and to avoid

00:43:13.574 --> 00:43:18.786
the landmines that are in
different business cultures is

00:43:18.786 --> 00:43:23.807
to get someone that knows the
business culture of that

00:43:23.807 --> 00:43:29.327
particular culture very well,
so you end up selecting a group

00:43:29.327 --> 00:43:31.918
of advisors,
in any nation in which you

00:43:31.918 --> 00:43:34.983
operate,
that have a very deep

00:43:34.983 --> 00:43:42.172
understanding of that particular
business culture and can guide

00:43:42.172 --> 00:43:48.550
you and your client through that
particular culture.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:50.952
I want to give you an example
that is so--if not we have too

00:43:50.952 --> 00:43:51.400
abstract.
 

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.780
I want to give you an example
that it's--actually it's

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.440
personal to some extent.
 

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.784
Goldman was very late compared
to the other firms in moving

00:43:59.784 --> 00:44:00.420
overseas.
 

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:06.800
Goldman started a small
operation in London in 1987,

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.320
when JPMorgan was big,
when Lehman was big,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.659
when Meryl was big--no Meryl
started a little later,

00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:16.929
but definitely when Morgan
Stanley was big,

00:44:16.929 --> 00:44:23.996
and at one point the problem
that the Goldman people sent

00:44:23.996 --> 00:44:28.539
overseas faced was how do we
get--

00:44:28.539 --> 00:44:34.809
how do we enlarge in Europe
without making too many

00:44:34.809 --> 00:44:36.190
mistakes?
 

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:42.074
The usual traditional way of
American firms to do that was to

00:44:42.074 --> 00:44:45.900
send investment bankers from the
U.S.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:51.940
and waited until they learned
the various cultures.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.282
A very smart banker,
Goldman, who,

00:44:54.282 --> 00:44:58.329
by the way, is one of the first
graduates of these SOM;

00:44:58.329 --> 00:45:01.762
when he had the responsibility
of Europe he said--the reason

00:45:01.762 --> 00:45:05.193
why I know it and I say it's
personal because that's the way

00:45:05.193 --> 00:45:06.940
in which I wasn't counted.
 

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.619
He said, "Wait a second,
here we have to do something

00:45:09.619 --> 00:45:10.559
totally different.
 

00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:15.380
We have to select for every
nation where we operate,

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.489
someone that maybe is not a
banker,

00:45:18.489 --> 00:45:22.269
who cares, but that knows that
business culture very

00:45:22.269 --> 00:45:26.570
well," and so we had a
generation of lateral hires.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:30.626
Me, my colleague in France,
one in Spain,

00:45:30.626 --> 00:45:33.670
one in Germany,
one in England,

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:36.610
one in Holland,
one in Sweden,

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:41.480
none of them came from
investment banking;

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.579
very few of them came from
banking.

00:45:43.579 --> 00:45:45.650
My French colleague came from
the States,

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:51.146
and when I did my interview
with John Soren before the

00:45:51.146 --> 00:45:55.632
selection I said--
he said what would you like to

00:45:55.632 --> 00:45:57.452
do, I said,
"How can I think about

00:45:57.452 --> 00:45:59.610
going into investment banking,
I can't even count.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:01.429
I can't count now.
 

00:46:01.429 --> 00:46:02.909
I can't balance a
checkbook."

00:46:02.909 --> 00:46:06.601
He said, "Don't worry,
we have hundreds of people that

00:46:06.601 --> 00:46:09.538
can do that,
and we will give you a smart VP

00:46:09.538 --> 00:46:12.460
that knows everything about
investment banking,

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.467
but you can operate an Italian
business in

00:46:14.467 --> 00:46:15.789
&gt;
 

00:46:15.789 --> 00:46:17.039
I said, "I think so."
 

00:46:17.039 --> 00:46:20.369
He said, "Do you under--we
want to have twenty clients,

00:46:20.369 --> 00:46:22.570
no more in Italy,
or fifteen clients.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:26.239
Do you know which client we
want and which we don't?"

00:46:26.239 --> 00:46:27.400
I said, "I think so."
 

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.958
He said, "Do you know the
way the client we want to

00:46:29.958 --> 00:46:31.030
operate inside?"
 

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:32.237
I said, "I think so,"
and he said,

00:46:32.237 --> 00:46:34.010
"Okay, who cares if you
can't balance a checkbook?"

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:42.650
Goldman became the first
investment bank in Europe from

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:51.931
1994 to 1997 in three years,
when in 1993 it was well below

00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:55.779
everybody else,
and it is due to that

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:59.510
particular creativity of John
&gt;

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.510
who saw it clearly,
at least at this cultural

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:02.010
business.
 

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:04.159
How can I send an American or
British in Italy?

00:47:04.159 --> 00:47:05.469
They don't even speak the
language.

00:47:05.469 --> 00:47:09.090
Or in France they--I mean how
can you?

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:12.956
You ever try to do a deal in
France, or in Spain,

00:47:12.956 --> 00:47:17.144
even for someone that has
a--some sort of exposure to

00:47:17.144 --> 00:47:20.610
different business culture like
myself.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.760
I would never be able to do it.
 

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.307
Like someone else would like to
try to do it in Italy,

00:47:26.307 --> 00:47:29.521
try to understand how Fiat
works, or Enel thinks,

00:47:29.521 --> 00:47:32.000
or only
&gt;

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.090
operates.
 

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:42.623
Prof: So when--in the
context of the states you sent a

00:47:42.623 --> 00:47:49.449
beaten up, Dartmouth linebacker
to Washington?

00:47:49.449 --> 00:47:53.050
Paolo Zanonni:
 Hank was--now the story

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.889
about Hank is he has always been
a Republican.

00:47:56.889 --> 00:48:02.414
Prof: Do you want to
give your little imitation of

00:48:02.414 --> 00:48:04.190
his voice style?
 

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:08.351
Paolo Zanonni:
 Paolo--his real voice

00:48:08.351 --> 00:48:11.668
style was,
the real imitation,

00:48:11.668 --> 00:48:16.112
"Paolo go and get the
business,"

00:48:16.112 --> 00:48:18.929
at 3:00 in the morning.
 

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:25.239
Hank has always been a
Republican.

00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:28.739
He--if you talk to him,
he ascribed his success at

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:32.954
Goldman with the fact that he
didn't know what to do when he

00:48:32.954 --> 00:48:37.313
got out of The Harvard Business
School and he went to work for

00:48:37.313 --> 00:48:41.599
The Nixon Whitehouse in the
domestic affair division,

00:48:41.599 --> 00:48:47.699
and he finds himself at 24/25
immediately after Watergate,

00:48:47.699 --> 00:48:51.960
and everybody about him is
either in jail or had to resign,

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.942
so he becomes the most senior
person in that department and he

00:48:57.942 --> 00:49:00.590
has to deal with the CEO.
 

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:05.449
He has to deal for a year and a
half with the CEOs of large

00:49:05.449 --> 00:49:07.768
corporations,
and he learns,

00:49:07.768 --> 00:49:11.893
and at the end he decided he
doesn't like the government and

00:49:11.893 --> 00:49:15.739
he tries to get a job at Goldman
and he gets hired,

00:49:15.739 --> 00:49:17.670
and what he was always telling
me he would say,

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:20.389
see the real skill that I had
was not what they taught me,

00:49:20.389 --> 00:49:23.244
The Harvard Business School,
but the fact that I spent a

00:49:23.244 --> 00:49:26.202
year and a half in interacting
with CEOs and CFOs from the

00:49:26.202 --> 00:49:29.369
largest corporation because I
was at The White House and there

00:49:29.369 --> 00:49:31.460
was--
nobody was more senior than me.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:37.557
So he had been--Bush tried to
get him to be the Secretary of

00:49:37.557 --> 00:49:41.382
the Treasury,
to my knowledge which is

00:49:41.382 --> 00:49:46.239
limited, at least twice before
he accepted.

00:49:46.239 --> 00:49:50.451
At one point he decided that it
was time to let Glen Klein be

00:49:50.451 --> 00:49:53.469
the chairman and that was a
perfect exit.

00:49:53.469 --> 00:49:59.998
Prof: Last question for
today, a simple observation

00:49:59.998 --> 00:50:06.411
would be that Goldman has
essentially bet its life on the

00:50:06.411 --> 00:50:09.389
quality of the people.
 

00:50:09.389 --> 00:50:13.570
Just meaning all the things
you're talking about,

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:18.358
plus something to do with just
sheer mental horse power,

00:50:18.358 --> 00:50:19.840
smart people.
 

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.304
Paolo Zanonni:
 There is a reasonable

00:50:22.304 --> 00:50:23.909
amount of smart of people.
 

00:50:23.909 --> 00:50:27.762
Wait--
Prof: Don't overstate

00:50:27.762 --> 00:50:28.360
here Paolo.
 

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.762
Paolo Zanonni:
 No, there is a reasonable

00:50:29.762 --> 00:50:31.164
amount of smart people,
but do you know what the

00:50:31.164 --> 00:50:32.119
characteristic--you know it.
 

00:50:32.119 --> 00:50:35.699
I mean everybody who goes to an
Ivy League school would know it.

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:40.684
Determination,
it's almost as important as

00:50:40.684 --> 00:50:44.367
brain power,
and definitely

00:50:44.367 --> 00:50:50.739
Goldman--definitely you will not
get a chance,

00:50:50.739 --> 00:50:54.650
not even of becoming a VP,
not a partner,

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:55.860
if you are not determined.
 

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.923
The associate and the analyst
work 100 hours per week,

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:02.838
for years, for five years,
seven years,

00:51:02.838 --> 00:51:04.219
and ten years.
 

00:51:04.219 --> 00:51:07.552
The partners work 70 or 80
hours per week until they

00:51:07.552 --> 00:51:11.369
retire;
unless you are ready to do

00:51:11.369 --> 00:51:13.110
that, no way.
 

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:14.550
Prof: And if the phone
rings--

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:16.119
Paolo Zanonni:
 If the phone rings--

00:51:16.119 --> 00:51:18.820
I told you, Hank was used
too--when he was the chairman,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.889
Hank was used to listening to
voicemail,

00:51:20.889 --> 00:51:23.099
because now we communicate via
email,

00:51:23.099 --> 00:51:25.260
then we communicated only via
voicemail.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:31.409
In a firm that was--that had
$25 billion in revenues,

00:51:31.409 --> 00:51:34.480
you could leave a voicemail to
Hank Paulson,

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:39.085
and unless he was on a plane,
you got an answer in less than

00:51:39.085 --> 00:51:41.489
five hours,
and if he was on a plane,

00:51:41.489 --> 00:51:43.429
it depends how long the flight
was,

00:51:43.429 --> 00:51:46.960
but fifteen hours you got your
answer after fifteen hours.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.327
Prof: Terrific,
so please review the slides for

00:51:50.327 --> 00:51:53.949
Wednesday, and let's thank Paolo
for this very interesting

00:51:53.949 --> 00:51:56.146
conversation
Paolo Zanonni:

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:57.199
 Thank you.
 

00:51:57.199 --> 00:52:02.000

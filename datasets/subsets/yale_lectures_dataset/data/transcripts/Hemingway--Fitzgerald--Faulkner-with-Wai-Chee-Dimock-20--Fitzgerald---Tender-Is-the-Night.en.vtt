00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:03.067
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: But the
part of the poem

00:00:03.067 --> 00:00:04.500
actually has a reference to

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.533
the bell tolling, which is
kind of an eerie, totally

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.433
unplanned, I think, but kind of
nonetheless very strange,

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:14.900
accidental connection to For
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.600
So "forlorn, the very word is
like a bell to toll me back

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.967
from thee to my soul self.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:24.967
Adieu, the fancy cannot cheat
so well, as she is famed to

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:27.167
do, deceiving elf."

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:32.567
So even from what Fitzgerald
himself is reciting that

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:37.300
beauty cannot keep, that's the
note on which he ends.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.467
And what is actually in the
Keats poem that is, once

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:44.733
again, is a tolling of a
bell, tolling your form

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.867
self back to you.

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:52.533
This novel is very much about
decline, about loss of what

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.367
used to be yours.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:57.500
This is the story that Tender
is the Night is telling

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.300
someone with tremendous promise
early on in his life,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.200
but basically losing
it gradually.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.300
And it is that subtraction, that
process of subtraction,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.867
things being taken away from
him, that the novel

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:12.800
chronicles.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.700
So this novel--

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.133
I'm sure you're sick of
this at this point--

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.333
can very much be read within the
paradigm of have and have

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:24.700
not, Dick Diver and I
don't think I'm--

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:25.567
you probably--

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:28.767
well any case, it would be very
interesting, very useful

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:32.000
to think about Dick Diver once
again if yet another example

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.533
of someone who's struggling
between those two posts, have

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.067
and have not.

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:41.200
But the novel certainly
begins with a very

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.733
different note, right?

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.767
The very glamorous,
French Riviera.

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:50.867
And in fact, it's modeled on a
very glamorous couple, Gerald

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:53.900
and Sara Murphy.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.800
So actually we can't really
see how magical they were.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.733
But apparently they had this
circle of friends around them,

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:06.567
and every day was
a special day.

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:08.500
So the novel was supposedly
attributed to them.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.500
And in fact, there was a
show at the Beinecke --

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.433
I think it was a couple years
ago-- called "Making it New."

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:19.400
The art of Gerald and Sara
Murphy very much attributed to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.000
this very charismatic couple.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.533
But in fact, Fitzgerald didn't
have to look too far.

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:33.600
He and his wife Zelda were quite
charismatic as well.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.267
And certainly very much
part of that world.

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:45.533
This is a PBS feature on
Fitzgerald, and this image was

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:46.700
actually taken from it.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.367
And this is another image of
Fitzgerald, his daughter

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:55.667
Scottie, and Zelda in the
French Riviera, 1926.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.100
And those were really the
productive years.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.400
The Great Gatsby came out in
'25, and then he was working

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.933
on this when he was at
the French Riviera.

00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:11.400
But as we read on, we know that,
in fact, that glamour

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.767
and that magic probably
were not sustainable.

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:19.200
So his first novel was very
much about sustainability.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.667
How long can that last.
And so there's a--

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:30.567
and in fact, it's almost
implicit in the way that they

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:33.867
were thought of as the
golden couple.

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:38.100
And Dorothy Parker, another
well-known novelist, said that

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.200
they did both look as
though they had just

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.667
stepped out of the sun.

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:45.000
So in the sense that they
lived in this completely

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.367
light-filled world.

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:53.700
But there's a different way in
which being in the sun can

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.900
have a different meaning
in Fitzgerald's career.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.667
And it turned out in fact, his
only hugely successful novel

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:04.600
was his first novel.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.167
And even The Great Gatsby, as we
know, didn't sell all that

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:09.833
well in his own lifetime.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:13.033
It was out of print before
he died, in his

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:15.000
relatively short life.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.433
So Fitzgerald, in order just to
make a living had to have

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:21.400
other jobs.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:28.367
And he was a screenwriter in
Hollywood in the '30s.

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:31.967
And so there are a number of
books written about Fitzgerald

00:04:31.967 --> 00:04:33.933
as a screenwriter.

00:04:33.933 --> 00:04:36.600
This is Some Time in the Sun.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.333
But it pretty much is a kind
or an ironic reference to

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:44.533
being in the sun, as we can see
from the pictures, it's

00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:46.333
not such a glamorous
time to be a

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:48.000
screenwriter in Hollywood.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.900
You're stuck with
your typewriter.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.600
So the phrase that was used
for all the screenwriters,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.967
including Fitzgerald, including
Faulkner, as we

00:04:56.967 --> 00:05:01.133
know, so for all these people
was they were hacks with their

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:02.900
Underwood typewriter.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.800
They were hack writers, not
having a lot of control over

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.533
the material.

00:05:08.533 --> 00:05:13.067
Here is another book about
Fitzgerald in Hollywood.

00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:16.967
And this is a picture
of him in the '30s

00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:19.067
struggling pretty much.

00:05:19.067 --> 00:05:22.633
There's a very important
collection of Fitzgerald's

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:25.867
screenplays, 2,000
pages, at the

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.700
University of South Carolina.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.700
And Fitzgerald himself,
actually, also wrote 17

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:39.167
stories that were published in
Esquire magazine between

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:43.900
January of 1940 to May '41, and
then he died after that.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.667
So it was actually published
after his death.

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:49.833
But they're The Pat
Hobby Stories.

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:52.800
There are 17 stories about this
screenwriter, down and

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.067
out screenwriter in Hollywood.

00:05:56.067 --> 00:06:02.633
And basically very alcoholic,
so quite autobiographical.

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:07.500
So we know that film, actually,
was front and center

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.367
for Fitzgerald pretty much from
the '20s to the '30s, and

00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:16.167
very much till the
end of his life.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:22.267
So it is really a very organic
part of his career.

00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:26.667
So what I'd like to do today is
to talk about the ways in

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:32.000
which cinematic techniques get
translated into linguistic and

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.100
textual techniques.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.100
And especially I wanted to
look at two phenomena,

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.800
flashback, which is very much
something that was used in

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.800
Hollywood films. But also
montage, something that was

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.400
used more in European films,
especially in the Russian

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.767
cinema, but was gradually making
its way to mainstream

00:06:54.767 --> 00:06:57.233
Hollywood film as well.

00:06:57.233 --> 00:07:01.967
So the structure for today's
lecture, I'll begin with the

00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:08.300
publication history of Tender
is the Night, which actually

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.333
it first came out
in a magazine,

00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:11.933
and then two editions.

00:07:11.933 --> 00:07:17.833
The first edition has a
flashback, and the '51 edition

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:21.167
much later, actually
turned it into a

00:07:21.167 --> 00:07:23.633
chronological narrative.

00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:28.400
What we see today, actually, is
a restoration to that 1934

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.100
edition with the flashback,
and I'll give

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.933
you details of that.

00:07:32.933 --> 00:07:37.033
So because the narrative order
of Tender is the Night is in

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:40.533
some sense switchable or
reversible, we'll be looking

00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:42.733
at phenomenon of switchability
or

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:46.200
reversibility in three ways.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.767
One is looking at sequence of
adjectives, how they are

00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:51.300
reversible.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.867
We'll be looking at the relation
between actor and

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:55.567
accessory or appendage.

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:58.200
And we'll be looking at the
relation between proper nouns

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.233
and active verbs.

00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:03.800
So a grammatical relation, a
kind of reversibility of

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.667
grammatical relation.

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:08.400
And then we'll be looking at
montage as a technique, and

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.700
the way that that is played
out in thematic ways.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.533
But first of all, the
publication history of Tender

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:17.800
is the Night.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.567
We're very used to this.

00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:22.300
Authors quite often would
publish first in magazines.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.233
So it came out in four
installments

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:26.267
in Scribner's magazine.

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:30.633
And Scribner's also published
the novel in '34.

00:08:30.633 --> 00:08:36.100
So this is the first edition
of the novel.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:45.267
And then it came out as a Bantam
edition, $0.35 in 1951

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:50.067
So the two editions, there's a
huge difference between the

00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:51.933
two editions.

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:58.300
The '34 edition, book one,
begins in 1925, and then

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:05.433
there's a jump back to eight
years ago, back to 1917.

00:09:05.433 --> 00:09:10.067
So it begins basically with Dick
Diver and his family in

00:09:10.067 --> 00:09:11.333
the French Riviera.

00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:14.733
And then it goes back when he
was just a young doctor, just

00:09:14.733 --> 00:09:16.833
the beginning, the very
beginning of his career full

00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:18.933
of promise, 1917.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:24.767
And then it goes back to a later
point of his life, 1930.

00:09:24.767 --> 00:09:29.600
So this is the edition that was
published, that Fitzgerald

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.667
originally published.

00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:38.700
And some critics objected to
this out of sequence, this not

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.467
chronological narrative.

00:09:40.467 --> 00:09:44.467
So when it came out as the
Bantam classic that was

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:46.467
switched, and it began
chronologically.

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:50.567
It began with Dick Diver's
early promise as a young

00:09:50.567 --> 00:09:52.833
doctor, and then it just
proceeds chronologically.

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:59.933
So reversing the order of the
'34 edition, and eliminating

00:09:59.933 --> 00:10:01.133
the flashback.

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:05.033
So we can talk a little bit-- in
fact, I would encourage you

00:10:05.033 --> 00:10:09.767
to think more in section about
why it is important for

00:10:09.767 --> 00:10:13.900
Fitzgerald to have
the flashback.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.167
What effect is achieved by
having a narrative that is out

00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:19.967
of sequence?

00:10:19.967 --> 00:10:23.300
And I hope that I'll be talking
a little bit about

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.067
that in the lectures as well.

00:10:25.067 --> 00:10:28.767
But I would encourage you to
have your opinion, really,

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:30.567
about this.

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:32.900
But today I wanted to
concentrate, because we

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.867
haven't read so far into the
novel, I wanted to concentrate

00:10:37.867 --> 00:10:42.167
on switchability or
reversibility as a relatively

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:43.467
small scale phenomenon.

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:47.333
Not so much looking at the
narrative form as reversible,

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:52.167
but looking at very minute
details within the novel that

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:53.833
are reversible.

00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:59.833
So the order of appearance of
adjectives can be seen as

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:00.600
reversible.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.433
This is just one example.

00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:07.400
"Nearest her, on the other side,
a young woman lay under

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.967
a roof of umbrellas making out
a list of things from a book

00:11:11.967 --> 00:11:13.600
open on the sand.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.900
Her bathing suit was pulled off
her shoulders and her back

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:21.567
a ruddy, orange brown, set off
by a string of creamy pearls,

00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:23.433
shown in the sun.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:28.800
Her face was hard and
lovely and pitiful."

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.333
So those adjectives
don't go together.

00:11:32.333 --> 00:11:37.000
Usually they are not seen in
such close proximity, "hard,"

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.833
and "lovely," and "pitiful." And
just to have those three

00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:46.533
adjectives, they are lined
up in that particular way

00:11:46.533 --> 00:11:49.033
generates kind of a
mini narrative.

00:11:49.033 --> 00:11:53.433
So this is one way in which
the order of appearance of

00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:59.467
adjectives is a case of a kind
of a mini narrativization of a

00:11:59.467 --> 00:12:02.867
description, even though it
seems to be just descriptive.

00:12:02.867 --> 00:12:06.167
Nonetheless, there's an implicit
narrative suggests

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:08.900
that by that order of
appearance, and the narrative

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.767
would be different if we were
to reverse the order.

00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:17.167
If her face were pitiful and
lovely and hard it would be a

00:12:17.167 --> 00:12:19.533
different narrative.

00:12:19.533 --> 00:12:22.467
And Fitzgerald's not going to
let those adjectives go, as

00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:24.167
you will see.

00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:32.867
So right here, we also have this
additional image that her

00:12:32.867 --> 00:12:36.633
shoulders and back are ruddy and
orange brown, and there's

00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:42.367
a string of creamy pearls
around her neck.

00:12:42.367 --> 00:12:47.067
When Fitzgerald comes back to
this detail, he does something

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:48.667
else for that detail.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:52.933
So this is him revising himself
all the time, revising

00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:54.933
his mini narrative
all the time.

00:12:54.933 --> 00:13:01.467
"Nicole Diver, her brown back
hanging from her pearls, was

00:13:01.467 --> 00:13:05.667
looking through a recipe book
for chicken Maryland." Her

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:08.933
brown back hanging
from the pearls.

00:13:08.933 --> 00:13:12.433
Before it was pearls hanging
around her neck.

00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:15.200
All of a sudden there's a
reversible relation between

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.867
the actor and the appendage, so
that is it her brown back

00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:21.167
that is hanging from
the pearls.

00:13:21.167 --> 00:13:23.733
So this suggests that the pearls
are very important,

00:13:23.733 --> 00:13:25.367
that maybe money is
very important.

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:29.300
Really is about whether the
money is more important than

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.600
human beings, or vice versa.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.100
So once again, this more than--
in fact, more than just

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.767
a mini narrative, but kind of
the whole vision of the world,

00:13:38.767 --> 00:13:42.100
whole vision of the relation
in between humanity and

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:47.333
economy is suggested by the
very, very micro detail of the

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:52.800
reversible relation between
"back" and "pearls." So I

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.500
would say that reversibility is
really the key player all

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.933
through the novel.

00:13:59.933 --> 00:14:04.267
Operation off scales operates
between adjectives, operate

00:14:04.267 --> 00:14:09.033
between different books, the
three main books of the novel.

00:14:09.033 --> 00:14:11.867
And they operate on the shape
of Dick Diver's career.

00:14:11.867 --> 00:14:13.600
So very, very important
concept.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.067
But just to give you one more
example of a very local micro

00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:22.467
instance of switchability or
reversibility has to do with

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:26.933
the transitive relation between
proper names and

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:27.767
active verbs.

00:14:27.767 --> 00:14:31.000
So we know that there's a
character in a novel called

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.700
Dick Diver.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.900
And here's Rosemary, the
actress, talking about what

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.767
she does and what
she has to do.

00:14:38.767 --> 00:14:42.633
She has a fever, but because
the set is very expensive,

00:14:42.633 --> 00:14:45.667
they just have to shoot.

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:48.200
So this is what she has to do.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.333
She has to dive into the
water for that episode.

00:14:52.333 --> 00:14:56.533
"One day I happened to have the
grippe and didn't know it

00:14:56.533 --> 00:14:59.967
and they were taking a
scene where I dove

00:14:59.967 --> 00:15:02.900
into a canal in Venice.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:08.500
It was a very expensive set so
I had to dive and dive and

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.600
dive all morning."

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:17.167
And obviously, it's not a
trivial or unconnected detail

00:15:17.167 --> 00:15:20.533
in a novel where
the protagonist

00:15:20.533 --> 00:15:21.633
is called Dick Diver.

00:15:21.633 --> 00:15:24.833
That there should be someone
else diving and diving and

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:29.267
diving, because of her
discipline as an actress.

00:15:29.267 --> 00:15:36.700
So I think that right then and
there, the question opens up

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:44.200
who is more capable of a kind
of sustainable performance?

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.900
It seems that just the
repetition of those three

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:52.267
words, "dive and dive and dive
all morning" suggest that

00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:55.867
Rosemary is probably going to be
an actress who will have a

00:15:55.867 --> 00:15:59.600
long career because she's
so disciplined and just

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:08.133
hardworking that if she has to
do something she would do it.

00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:10.933
So the question then, because
she seems to have such a

00:16:10.933 --> 00:16:14.833
sustainable career, sustainable
performance,

00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:18.967
whether Dick Diver is capable
of that sustainable

00:16:18.967 --> 00:16:22.367
performance, the person who has
that proper name, whether

00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:25.467
he can actually live up
to the promise of

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:29.000
his name, Dick Diver.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.500
So I want now to really
zero-in on those two

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.567
adjectives, "hard" and
"pitiful," and look at the way

00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:43.100
Fitzgerald really spins
out a whole narrative.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.533
Basically, maybe the whole
novel is based on the

00:16:47.533 --> 00:16:50.400
interplay between those
two adjectives.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.567
So let's look at what the
hard Nicole does.

00:16:55.567 --> 00:17:02.633
And what comes through, what
kind of story emerges when we

00:17:02.633 --> 00:17:07.500
go along the axis of Nicole
as a hard person.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.800
This is what she says to
Rosemary just talking casually

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.667
about the beach and so on,
and about the tourists.

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:20.500
"Well, I have felt there were
too many people on the beach

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.500
this summer," Nicole admitted.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.867
"Our beach that Dick made out
of a pebble pile," she

00:17:25.867 --> 00:17:28.833
considered, and then lowering
her voice out of range of the

00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:32.600
trio of nannies who sat back
under another umbrella,

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.900
"Still, they're preferable to
those British last summer who

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:37.667
kept shouting about: 'Isn't
the sea blue?

00:17:37.667 --> 00:17:39.233
Isn't the sky white?

00:17:39.233 --> 00:17:43.233
Isn't little Nellie's nose red?'
Rosemary thought she

00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:48.567
would not like to have
Nicole for an enemy."

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:54.767
So I think that this is a great
demonstration of a hard

00:17:54.767 --> 00:18:00.600
person without this person
actually lifting a finger to

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.833
do a thing.

00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:05.333
It's just the way
her mind works.

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:10.033
It is her tone of voice, it is
the way she thinks about

00:18:10.033 --> 00:18:13.767
nannies, people in her employ.

00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:17.133
The way she thinks about people
who don't have to cling

00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:19.367
to the beach that she does.

00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:24.433
It's really the speech pattern
and the tone of voice of

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:30.267
someone who's never not been
on the top of the world, as

00:18:30.267 --> 00:18:33.900
she looks down on everyone,
and just

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.600
putting them in the places.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.833
So this is the hard Nicole.

00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:45.033
It actually gives another
meaning to her back hanging

00:18:45.033 --> 00:18:47.033
from the string of pearls.

00:18:47.033 --> 00:18:51.900
That may be, really, this is
what the real Nicole is.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.533
It is the fact that she
is hanging from

00:18:54.533 --> 00:18:55.733
the string of pearls.

00:18:55.733 --> 00:19:00.100
That they will always be a
string of pearls for her to

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:05.567
hang from that she can afford
to look at the world in this

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:08.067
way, look at other people in
this way, and speak in that

00:19:08.067 --> 00:19:11.000
particular tone of voice that
signals to Rosemary-- it takes

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.433
about two seconds for Rosemary
to know what kind of a person

00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:15.600
she is dealing with.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:23.067
So she casts a summary of what
a person is without recourse

00:19:23.067 --> 00:19:24.700
to any action.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.267
And in fact, Nicole doesn't
really act until the very end

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:28.100
of the novel.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.833
And even then it's not even
especially hard kind of

00:19:31.833 --> 00:19:34.800
action, although that's
debatable.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.633
But as is the case with
Fitzgerald, the word "hard,"

00:19:40.633 --> 00:19:44.467
it's not allowed to stand alone,
because we can't forget

00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:47.467
that in fact, there were three
adjectives, "hard," and

00:19:47.467 --> 00:19:51.333
"lovely" and "pitiful." So that
kind of permutation, it's

00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:54.033
like a dance, a dance
of adjectives, will

00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:55.300
keep coming up again.

00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:01.033
So just a few pages later, now
the description of Nicole, her

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:03.433
face at different times,
the "hard" as to be

00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:04.933
in quotation marks.

00:20:04.933 --> 00:20:10.367
"Her face was hard, almost
stern, save for the soft gleam

00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:14.867
of piteous doubt that looked
from her green eyes." So it

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:18.433
seems that those adjectives
are really ingrained in

00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:19.433
Fitzgerald's mind.

00:20:19.433 --> 00:20:23.800
That he cannot think about
Nicole without using that

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.067
trio, "lovely," as well as --
of maybe just a duo of two

00:20:28.067 --> 00:20:28.700
adjectives.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:34.100
They are the two poles of the
spectrum on which she shadows

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.933
back and forth.

00:20:35.933 --> 00:20:41.500
So because "pitiful" is so
much a companion to the

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:46.367
adjective, "hard." Let's look at
one instance of the pitiful

00:20:46.367 --> 00:20:51.300
Nicole, and see whether or not
there is an organic connection

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.667
between the "pitiful" Nicole
and the "hard" Nicole.

00:20:54.667 --> 00:20:56.600
And we have to go back
earlier, so we

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.200
have to go back to--

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:02.200
well go forward to book two,
which is backward in time.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:08.833
Go back to 1917 when she was a
patient, and Dick Diver was

00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:12.300
about to-- well actually, he
had not even agreed to do

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.067
anything for her.

00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:17.067
He was just someone who had
been consulted about her.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:21.433
And she was writing to him when
she was in this mental

00:21:21.433 --> 00:21:22.433
institution.

00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:26.933
"Dear Captain Diver, I write to
you because there's no one

00:21:26.933 --> 00:21:30.467
else to whom I can turn and
it seems to me if this

00:21:30.467 --> 00:21:31.700
farcicle"--

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.067
misspelled by Nicole--

00:21:33.067 --> 00:21:38.633
"if this farcicle situation is
apparent to one as sick as me

00:21:38.633 --> 00:21:40.633
it should be apparent to you.

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:44.333
The mental trouble is all over
and besides that I am

00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:48.167
completely broken and
humiliated, if that was what

00:21:48.167 --> 00:21:49.267
they wanted.

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:52.833
My family have shamefully
neglected me, there's no use

00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:55.767
asking them for help or pity.

00:21:55.767 --> 00:21:58.933
I have had enough and it is
simply ruining my health and

00:21:58.933 --> 00:22:02.500
wasting my time pretending that
what is the matter with

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.500
my head is curable."

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:09.033
So this is the absolute
low point for Nicole.

00:22:09.033 --> 00:22:10.533
She is by herself.

00:22:10.533 --> 00:22:13.467
Her family isn't there, she's in
the hands of strangers who

00:22:13.467 --> 00:22:15.400
are paid to take care of her.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.333
And here, who is this person
who seems to have his whole

00:22:18.333 --> 00:22:25.100
life full of promise ahead of
him, completely healthy, about

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:28.900
to be launching this
great career.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:35.900
So in one sense it is Nicole
at her most abject.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:39.433
That this is someone who really
has no future to look

00:22:39.433 --> 00:22:40.967
forward to.

00:22:40.967 --> 00:22:43.167
Has really no hope, really,
has nothing

00:22:43.167 --> 00:22:46.233
that she can claim.

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:50.700
Except that given the fact that
we have seen the hard

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:57.533
Nicole, I think that we should
also be alert a little bit to

00:22:57.533 --> 00:23:04.033
the suggestion of hardness,
even in this moment when

00:23:04.033 --> 00:23:06.033
Nicole is most object.

00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:09.767
And I think that, in fact,
that misspelled word,

00:23:09.767 --> 00:23:13.900
"farcicle," points to a
different linguistic usage.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.900
Some reason he uses the word
"farcicle," actually, is more

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:25.167
in command of the faculties
than is suggested by the

00:23:25.167 --> 00:23:28.533
profession of abjection
likewise.

00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:35.033
Likewise, it is simply "ruining
my health and wasting

00:23:35.033 --> 00:23:39.833
my time." Someone who would use
the phrase "waste my time"

00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:43.667
has a different sense of herself
than is suggested by

00:23:43.667 --> 00:23:45.667
the profession of abjection.

00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:51.633
So right there, even though it
is the pitiful Nicole who is

00:23:51.633 --> 00:23:56.867
in the foreground, an element
of hardness is never not on

00:23:56.867 --> 00:23:58.567
the horizon.

00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:02.800
I think that it is really that
combination that Fitzgerald

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.200
wants us to see that she's
completely switchable.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.667
The distance between hardness
and pitifulness is tiny.

00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:15.400
She can just go back and forth,
it takes one second for

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.167
her to switch from
one to the other.

00:24:18.167 --> 00:24:22.233
So one more instance of
the pitiful Nicole.

00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:25.267
This one is very late in her
life, so this is in the

00:24:25.267 --> 00:24:26.867
present for her.

00:24:26.867 --> 00:24:31.167
"Nicole knelt beside the tub
swaying sidewise and sidewise.

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:34.333
"It's you!" she cried, "It's
you come to intrude on the

00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:38.033
only privacy I have in the world
-- with your spread of

00:24:38.033 --> 00:24:39.067
red blood on it.

00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:40.333
I'll wear it for you --

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:43.867
I'm not ashamed, though
it was such a pity."

00:24:43.867 --> 00:24:48.167
So the word "pity"
is foregrounded.

00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:54.000
But once again, even though
this is Nicole out of her

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.600
mind, Nicole totally out of
control, Nicole gone crazy

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:03.000
again, and therefore, she
has to be medicalized.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.167
Nicole is a candidate
for medicalization.

00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:10.333
But even though she's a
candidate for medicalization,

00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:12.767
she's also quite aggressive,
as well as we can see.

00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:17.067
She's not so defenseless as
not to be able to say some

00:25:17.067 --> 00:25:21.300
pretty wounding things to
whoever would listen to her.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.500
So once again we have that
combination, the pitifulness

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.200
in the foreground, but hardness
is always lurking

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.600
very, very close to the front,
actually, in the background.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.833
So it's because of that, I
think, it's because the

00:25:35.833 --> 00:25:39.533
distance between the two
switchable platforms is such a

00:25:39.533 --> 00:25:43.633
small distance, that I think
that the technique of montage

00:25:43.633 --> 00:25:48.900
is especially helpful
to Fitzgerald.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.067
As I said before, I don't
think it was actually a

00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:58.400
mainstream Hollywood technique
in the '20s yet, although it

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.600
was already theorized by film
theorists all over the world.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.767
I'll give you one instance
of that.

00:26:04.767 --> 00:26:08.467
But basically, montage is a
film editing technique.

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:14.500
And the two things that are
central to it are dissolving

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.533
from one narrative into another,
and superimposition

00:26:18.533 --> 00:26:20.067
of one onto another.

00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:23.800
So these are two fundamental
elements of montage.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:29.133
And Sergei Eisenstein, the
Russian, great filmmaker in

00:26:29.133 --> 00:26:33.533
the '20s, he wrote
a lot on montage.

00:26:33.533 --> 00:26:38.300
In fact, I think that most
people who actually talk about

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.233
montage go back to Eisenstein's

00:26:41.233 --> 00:26:42.967
writing in the 1920s.

00:26:42.967 --> 00:26:47.433
So according to Eisenstein,
"Montage is the nerve of

00:26:47.433 --> 00:26:52.733
cinema." In the collision of
different narratives, "each

00:26:52.733 --> 00:26:57.633
sequential element is perceived
not next to the

00:26:57.633 --> 00:27:04.133
other, but on top of the other."
Even though they are

00:27:04.133 --> 00:27:07.900
sequential, even though one
comes after the other.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.800
And basically there's
no way we can--

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.033
this is how time works.

00:27:12.033 --> 00:27:14.933
One thing comes after another,
the structure of time.

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:19.400
There's no way we can completely
do without that, or

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.700
completely undermine that.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.300
But nonetheless, it's a way of
storytelling that makes that

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.800
sequential appearance almost
case of superimposition.

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:32.633
And I think that this is really
what Fitzgerald does

00:27:32.633 --> 00:27:35.267
for a good part of the time
in Tender is the Night.

00:27:35.267 --> 00:27:39.767
So let's just look at five or
six instances of what I would

00:27:39.767 --> 00:27:43.200
call different modes
of superimposition.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.767
Or superimposition being mapped
on different kinds of

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:51.800
thematics that are themselves
interrelated.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:57.300
So war, we began with
war in the very

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.433
beginning of this semester.

00:27:59.433 --> 00:28:03.267
And it turns out that war would
come back in quite a big

00:28:03.267 --> 00:28:06.767
way in this novel that
really otherwise has

00:28:06.767 --> 00:28:08.367
nothing to do with war.

00:28:08.367 --> 00:28:11.633
This is a novel set in the
French Riviera, and then

00:28:11.633 --> 00:28:18.133
basically in various civilian
and very luxurious settings.

00:28:18.133 --> 00:28:21.667
So it really has nothing
to do with war.

00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:26.833
Except that for some reason,
war keeps coming up in very

00:28:26.833 --> 00:28:28.533
strange illusions.

00:28:28.533 --> 00:28:32.833
So one of the first instances of
this, and usually it comes

00:28:32.833 --> 00:28:35.533
out in casual conversation.

00:28:35.533 --> 00:28:38.200
So sometimes between a major
character, and sometimes

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.100
between a minor character.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.367
So this is a conversation
between Rosemary and Tommy

00:28:42.367 --> 00:28:44.967
Barban who's a mercenary.

00:28:44.967 --> 00:28:48.033
Actually, I didn't know
that that was such an

00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:49.933
important class of--

00:28:49.933 --> 00:28:52.633
that was such an important
profession, but it turns out

00:28:52.633 --> 00:28:58.433
that maybe it was in the early
twentieth century.

00:28:58.433 --> 00:29:03.667
So Tommy, because he's a
mercenary, and he goes around

00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:05.800
from one place to
another, "Home?

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.733
I have no home.

00:29:06.733 --> 00:29:11.133
I am going to a war." "What
war?" "What war?

00:29:11.133 --> 00:29:12.400
Any war.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.067
I haven't seen a paper lately
but I suppose there's a war--

00:29:15.067 --> 00:29:19.067
there always is." "Don't
you care what you fight

00:29:19.067 --> 00:29:20.800
for?" "Not at all --

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:23.000
so long as I'm well treated.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.033
When I'm in rut I come to see
the Divers, because then I

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:30.633
know that in a few weeks
I'll want to go to

00:29:30.633 --> 00:29:34.000
war." Rosemary stiffened.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.100
"You like the Divers,"
she reminded him.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:37.800
"Of course--

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:39.933
especially her--

00:29:39.933 --> 00:29:44.500
but they make me want
to go to war."

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.833
Tommy Barban might be a
mercenary, but he certainly is

00:29:48.833 --> 00:29:50.867
not just brute strength.

00:29:50.867 --> 00:29:57.133
There's a lot of psychological
subtlety at play here.

00:29:57.133 --> 00:29:59.067
This is page 30.

00:29:59.067 --> 00:30:03.633
So we have no understanding
of what context

00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:06.367
Tommy Barban is speaking.

00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:10.667
All we can say is that it is
not an innocent context.

00:30:10.667 --> 00:30:15.900
That he has lots of things that
he's holding back about

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:19.633
how he feels about the Divers is
clear, that he doesn't like

00:30:19.633 --> 00:30:21.233
Dick Diver, right?

00:30:21.233 --> 00:30:23.567
That I like them,
especially her.

00:30:23.567 --> 00:30:26.633
But also the general sense
that it's just the two of

00:30:26.633 --> 00:30:30.533
them, for a few weeks is enough,
that is enough to make

00:30:30.533 --> 00:30:32.500
him want to go to war.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.467
We don't know what it is about
them that would have this kind

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:38.100
of effect on him.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.967
But it never fails.

00:30:39.967 --> 00:30:45.467
So right there and there, this
is a snake making its way into

00:30:45.467 --> 00:30:49.400
this paradise that is
the French Riviera.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.733
The least we can say that even
amount the close friends and

00:30:53.733 --> 00:30:57.767
people who are right there, who
are there constantly with

00:30:57.767 --> 00:31:00.967
them, they're people who
supposedly are very good

00:31:00.967 --> 00:31:04.900
friends of theirs have this
opinion about them.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:10.067
So we have-- this is just one
mystery that we have to figure

00:31:10.067 --> 00:31:12.067
out, and the details
of which we have to

00:31:12.067 --> 00:31:13.467
fill out for ourselves.

00:31:13.467 --> 00:31:16.167
And in fact, I would suggest
that even at the very end of

00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:18.967
the novel, I'm not sure that
we can completely clear up

00:31:18.967 --> 00:31:20.200
this mystery.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:25.000
But it's just sitting there, and
it's the superimposition

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
of love and war that creates
the particular kind of

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.667
psychological dynamics between
Rosemary and Tommy, and also

00:31:34.667 --> 00:31:37.900
between Tommy and the Divers.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.367
So it is not even visual.

00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:46.233
So I just want to emphasize that
when the film technique

00:31:46.233 --> 00:31:50.767
of montage is used in
a novel, it doesn't

00:31:50.767 --> 00:31:51.900
always have to be visual.

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.867
It can just be a case of
psychological superimposition,

00:31:55.867 --> 00:32:00.500
although sometimes Fitzgerald
also uses very, very visual

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.333
superimposition as well.

00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:06.133
But just to give you one more
example of how persistent

00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:09.367
Fitzgerald is about
superimposing these

00:32:09.367 --> 00:32:10.667
two, love and war.

00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:14.567
So they go and they walk out,
and it turns out that even

00:32:14.567 --> 00:32:21.567
here in this seemingly very
peaceful setting, that

00:32:21.567 --> 00:32:25.800
actually World War I was
fought very close by.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:30.433
So close by that the relics of
World War I was still there.

00:32:30.433 --> 00:32:35.700
And this is the spot, actually,
where the British

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:42.700
could only advance a foot at a
time, and the resistance was

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:48.300
so fierce that they could
only move ahead one foot

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.100
at a time, the army.

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.067
And it cost 20 lives
to date for them to

00:32:53.067 --> 00:32:55.400
go forward one foot.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.833
"This land here cost twenty
lives a foot that summer," he

00:32:58.833 --> 00:33:01.400
said to Rosemary.

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.600
She looked out obediently at
the rather bare green plain

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:07.867
with its low trees of
six years' growth.

00:33:07.867 --> 00:33:12.067
If Dick has added that they
were now being shelled she

00:33:12.067 --> 00:33:14.633
would have believed him
that afternoon.

00:33:14.633 --> 00:33:17.533
Her love had reached a point
where now at last, she was

00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:20.333
beginning to be unhappy,
to be desperate.

00:33:20.333 --> 00:33:22.800
She didn't know what to do --
she wanted to talk to her

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.733
mother."

00:33:23.733 --> 00:33:27.633
So here Rosemary is
deeply in love.

00:33:27.633 --> 00:33:31.733
She is in the throes of love, of
what seems to be unrequited

00:33:31.733 --> 00:33:38.433
love for Dick, and the necessary
background is World

00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:42.633
War I. That it is the fact that
she would have believed

00:33:42.633 --> 00:33:47.033
him if he had told her that they
were being shelled, once

00:33:47.033 --> 00:33:50.100
again, as in World War I, that
she would have believed him if

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.500
he had said that, that
is the measure of how

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.733
much in love she is.

00:33:54.733 --> 00:33:59.233
So it seems that love is really
not a freestanding

00:33:59.233 --> 00:34:00.500
entity in his novel.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.833
It's always mapped against
large-scale warfare.

00:34:04.833 --> 00:34:06.400
We don't simply know.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.500
The logic of that mapping
is not clear.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.267
In fact, I would also say that
this is another one of those

00:34:12.267 --> 00:34:17.533
mysteries that even at the end
of the novel, we might not be

00:34:17.533 --> 00:34:19.767
able to say exactly
what the logic is.

00:34:19.767 --> 00:34:23.467
But clearly, for Fitzgerald
there's a logic that always,

00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:27.067
persistently, we saw it in
this cross-mapping or

00:34:27.067 --> 00:34:30.133
superimposition of
love and war.

00:34:30.133 --> 00:34:34.467
One more example just to see
how obsessed he is, really,

00:34:34.467 --> 00:34:37.467
with this kind of
cross-mapping.

00:34:37.467 --> 00:34:40.533
General Grant -- so it's
not just World War I,

00:34:40.533 --> 00:34:42.033
but the Civil War.

00:34:42.033 --> 00:34:45.867
And this is something that
Fitzgerald has in common with

00:34:45.867 --> 00:34:48.200
Hemingway as well in For
Whom the Bell Tolls.

00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.400
We see that Spanish Civil War
and the American Civil War

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.367
sometimes cross-mapped in the
importance of Robert Jordan's

00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:56.467
grandfather.

00:34:56.467 --> 00:35:01.367
Here, for no reason that we can
see, the Civil War comes

00:35:01.367 --> 00:35:04.967
into play, in the midst of the
discussion about World War I.

00:35:04.967 --> 00:35:09.567
"General Grant invented this
kind of battle at Petersburg

00:35:09.567 --> 00:35:12.100
in sixty-five." "No,
he didn't --

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.033
he just invented
mass butchery.

00:35:15.033 --> 00:35:17.933
This kind of battle was invented
by Lewis Carroll and

00:35:17.933 --> 00:35:21.700
Jules Verne and whoever wrote
Undine, and country deacons

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:26.067
bowling and marraines in
Marseilles and girls seduced

00:35:26.067 --> 00:35:29.200
in the back lanes of Wurtemburg
and Westphalia.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.700
Why, this was a love-battle --

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:36.433
there was a century of
middle-class love spent here.

00:35:36.433 --> 00:35:39.833
This was the last
love-battle."

00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:43.433
Totally enigmatic use of
the English language.

00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:47.000
Love battle is not a phrase that
anyone else would use.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.500
Fitzgerald uses it as if
it was a most idiomatic

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:51.967
expression in the world.

00:35:51.967 --> 00:35:56.200
And that's because in his mind
there is such a tight knit

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:01.600
between love and war that you
almost cannot talk about one

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.100
without talking about
the other.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:09.533
But according to this apparent
analysis of war, it is really

00:36:09.533 --> 00:36:14.600
middle-class romantic love that
is at the back of war.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.733
It's a very long causal chain
to go from middle-class love

00:36:19.733 --> 00:36:24.567
to trench warfare, or to the
Civil War in the US history.

00:36:24.567 --> 00:36:27.967
It's a very, very long causal
chain, and we have to fill in

00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:31.200
lots of lots of relays in order
for that causal change

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:31.900
to make sense.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:35.533
But that's what Fitzgerald
wants us to imagine is to

00:36:35.533 --> 00:36:37.100
imagine all those missing
links that

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:38.867
he's not showing us.

00:36:38.867 --> 00:36:43.133
So this is I think that we've
seen enough to know that this

00:36:43.133 --> 00:36:46.600
really is a very significant
pattern not

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:48.500
explained to us, obviously.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:55.767
But that is one of the constants
in this novel is

00:36:55.767 --> 00:37:04.367
that extreme conditions of love
always require a very

00:37:04.367 --> 00:37:08.900
violent, large-scale violent
background for it to be fully

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:09.867
manifested.

00:37:09.867 --> 00:37:13.567
That maybe his articulation
requires some relation to that

00:37:13.567 --> 00:37:15.967
large-scale event.

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:24.967
So I want to turn now
to talk about--

00:37:24.967 --> 00:37:28.333
we've been looking at kind
of the narrative mapping.

00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:33.200
So a large-scale, historical
event that's constantly being

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:37.867
summoned and reactivated and
brought into a novel.

00:37:37.867 --> 00:37:45.167
So that's this one is on a macro
register that has the

00:37:45.167 --> 00:37:48.400
micro romantic relation.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:54.167
But it turns out that that
combination of love and war

00:37:54.167 --> 00:38:01.400
can also be played out in very,
very incidental moments

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:07.567
not involving the protagonist at
all, which suggests that it

00:38:07.567 --> 00:38:11.933
is the narrative fabric, it's
a descriptive fabric that

00:38:11.933 --> 00:38:14.067
Fitzgerald is--

00:38:14.067 --> 00:38:18.000
it's almost like a stylistic
take for Fitzgerald without

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.733
even making a huge thematic
point about it.

00:38:21.733 --> 00:38:23.800
That's what his mind
reverts to.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.200
Whenever he talks about any kind
of violence, there's also

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.267
this other element of love
that is superimposed.

00:38:31.267 --> 00:38:35.900
So this is a totally trivial
incident, except for the fact

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.833
that it's just the same
kind of dynamics.

00:38:38.833 --> 00:38:43.233
"At a Pullman entrance two
cars off, a vivid scene

00:38:43.233 --> 00:38:47.467
detached itself from the tenor
of many farewells.

00:38:47.467 --> 00:38:51.967
The young woman with the
helmet-like hair to whom

00:38:51.967 --> 00:38:57.400
Nicole had spoken made an odd
dodging little run away from

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.967
the man to whom she was talking
and plunged a frantic

00:39:01.967 --> 00:39:06.533
hand into her purse; then the
sound of two revolver shots

00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:09.533
cracked the narrow air
of the platform...

00:39:09.533 --> 00:39:12.667
But before the crowd closed in,
the others had seen the

00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:16.333
shot take effect, seen the
target sit down upon the

00:39:16.333 --> 00:39:18.667
platform."

00:39:18.667 --> 00:39:23.400
People constantly getting shot
in this novel, which is really

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:30.633
a surprising fact, for that
murder to appear with this

00:39:30.633 --> 00:39:34.167
kind of regularity in this
particular kind of social

00:39:34.167 --> 00:39:36.167
setting, but it does.

00:39:36.167 --> 00:39:41.867
So that in itself is a very
insistent pattern on the part

00:39:41.867 --> 00:39:42.867
of Fitzgerald.

00:39:42.867 --> 00:39:44.633
But I want to call
attention to this

00:39:44.633 --> 00:39:48.367
highly cinematic moment.

00:39:48.367 --> 00:39:55.300
The beginning was just
kind of the usual

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.900
scene at a train station.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.033
People are saying goodbye.

00:40:00.033 --> 00:40:05.233
But really, the introduction
of a textural element that

00:40:05.233 --> 00:40:11.333
actually could be filmed with
perfect to maximum effect, the

00:40:11.333 --> 00:40:14.700
young woman with the
helmet-like hair.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:19.500
A completely gratuitous detail
that would not have called

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.967
attention to itself--

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.733
would not otherwise have called
attention to itself,

00:40:25.733 --> 00:40:28.467
but in this novel, given
the superimposition of

00:40:28.467 --> 00:40:29.400
love and war does.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.900
So it's the helmet-like
hair who is a

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.833
total stranger to Nicole.

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:39.200
That Nicole has spoken "made an
odd dodging little run away

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.567
from a man to whom she was
talking, and plunged a little

00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:50.400
frantic hand into her purse."
It's that almost dance steps

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:55.000
taken by that woman.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.433
It's this as a kind of dance
movement, and then the shot

00:41:00.433 --> 00:41:09.600
coming after that as the not
predictable, not expected

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.367
conclusion to that dance
movement that creates this

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:15.633
montage effect.

00:41:15.633 --> 00:41:20.967
She's been talking to Nicole,
she's making a little run.

00:41:20.967 --> 00:41:24.600
Maybe we would expect someone
who's making a little run in a

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.967
train station to go and
catch the train.

00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:30.400
That's the most usual context
for the little running, except

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.233
it was a dodging little run.

00:41:32.233 --> 00:41:37.267
It turns out that the outcome
of that little run is, in

00:41:37.267 --> 00:41:38.833
fact, the shooting.

00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:44.700
So two completely separate
narratives being mapped onto

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:45.600
one another.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.500
They're much more standard and
surprising are they with

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.300
saying goodbye in the train
station with a totally

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.300
different story being
mapped onto it.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.767
And it turns out that the two
can actually share a lot of

00:41:58.767 --> 00:42:02.467
the same visual details unless
there's a divergence, and the

00:42:02.467 --> 00:42:05.367
violence of that divergence that
create that particular

00:42:05.367 --> 00:42:07.633
cinematic effect.

00:42:07.633 --> 00:42:12.433
So I just want to give you one
more example of this highly

00:42:12.433 --> 00:42:17.433
cinematic rendition of murder.

00:42:17.433 --> 00:42:22.200
And it turns out that Fitzgerald
is especially

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:28.567
interested in the way that the
sequence leading up to a

00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:33.533
murder, or the sequence by
which murder is finally

00:42:33.533 --> 00:42:35.367
recognized as murder.

00:42:35.367 --> 00:42:39.333
So here is a description of
something that happens in

00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:42.800
Rosemary's room, hotel room.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.000
And it takes a long time
to get to the end.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.467
I think that that's the point.

00:42:48.467 --> 00:42:50.900
So let's follow Fitzgerald
in this very,

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.433
very strange passage.

00:42:52.433 --> 00:42:57.067
"Then, rather gradually, she
realized without turning about

00:42:57.067 --> 00:43:00.700
that she was not alone
in the room.

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.300
In an inhabited room they are
refracting objects only half

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:10.033
noticed: varnished wood, more or
less polished brass, silver

00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:13.900
and ivory, and beyond these a
thousand conveyors of light

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:18.433
and shadow so mild that one
scarcely thinks of them as

00:43:18.433 --> 00:43:21.600
that, the tops of picture
frames, the edge of the

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.033
pencils or ash-trays, of crystal
or china ornaments;

00:43:26.033 --> 00:43:28.367
the totality of this
refraction --

00:43:28.367 --> 00:43:32.733
appealing to equally subtle
reflexes of the vision as well

00:43:32.733 --> 00:43:36.433
as those associational fragments
in the subconscious

00:43:36.433 --> 00:43:41.500
that we seem to hang on to, as
a glass-fitter keeps the

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.500
irregularly shaped pieces
that may do some time --

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:49.967
this fact might account for
what Rosemary afterward

00:43:49.967 --> 00:43:53.200
mysteriously described as
"realizing" that there was

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:57.400
some one in the room, before
she could determine it.

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:03.200
But when she did realize it she
turned swift in a sort of

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.567
ballet step and saw that a dead
Negro was stretched upon

00:44:07.567 --> 00:44:09.900
her bed."

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:15.867
This has got to be the most
deferred discovery of a dead

00:44:15.867 --> 00:44:21.600
body in any work of American
literature.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.967
It seems almost
counterproductive for the

00:44:25.967 --> 00:44:29.667
realization on the part of
Rosemary that she was not

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:34.600
alone in the room to the fact
that yes, there's a dead negro

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.400
on the bed.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:41.767
Why Fitzgerald would want to
take that long detour to me,

00:44:41.767 --> 00:44:48.367
actually, once again, is not
completely transparent.

00:44:48.367 --> 00:44:51.967
All we can say is that this is
a kind of cinematic moment

00:44:51.967 --> 00:44:55.400
when we soon know that something
is wrong in a room.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:01.833
But instead the focus is kept
frozen, fixated, on all these

00:45:01.833 --> 00:45:03.767
refracting objects.

00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:06.433
Varnished wood, ashtrays,
and so on.

00:45:06.433 --> 00:45:10.167
All these refracting objects
that are actually not

00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:12.167
reflecting that dead body.

00:45:12.167 --> 00:45:14.800
So this is a really weird kind
of way in which there are

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.233
multiple mirrors in a room, all
these refracting surfaces,

00:45:18.233 --> 00:45:21.967
but they're not reflecting the
central, the most important,

00:45:21.967 --> 00:45:26.433
crucial factor in that room,
the dead body on the bed.

00:45:26.433 --> 00:45:30.700
Instead, it seems simply to be
a meditation on the way the

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:33.800
world comes to us refracted, and
there are multiple objects

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.767
to be doing that, and the
relation between that and our

00:45:37.767 --> 00:45:40.267
subconscious, and the relation
between that and our memory.

00:45:40.267 --> 00:45:43.767
So almost a kind of a meditation
on the way in which

00:45:43.767 --> 00:45:47.967
our memory is structured
by visual refractions.

00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:51.533
And then finally coming
back to Rosemary.

00:45:51.533 --> 00:45:54.567
And even then repeating
exactly the

00:45:54.567 --> 00:45:55.900
same sequence, right.

00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.500
There's the woman before has
this dodging little run before

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.833
she plunges a hand
into her purse to

00:46:03.833 --> 00:46:07.500
pull out the revolver.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:11.100
And here, Rosemary's not going
to plunge into her purse, but

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.467
she's going to do a little
ballet dance, a ballet step

00:46:15.467 --> 00:46:19.467
before she discovers the
dead body on the bed.

00:46:19.467 --> 00:46:25.467
So this is all, we can say,
really, is maybe just describe

00:46:25.467 --> 00:46:31.500
and re-articulate what
Fitzgerald is doing is highly

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.533
delivered, it's highly stylized,
one of the most

00:46:33.533 --> 00:46:39.633
stylized moment, consciously,
maybe even heavy-handedly

00:46:39.633 --> 00:46:44.100
written, although to what end
is not entirely clear.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:48.233
But it's one of the most
purposeful moments in novel.

00:46:48.233 --> 00:46:51.500
So I think that we are obligated
to interpret it in

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:55.600
some fashion, and to attach some
degree of thematic weight

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.933
to this seemingly inexplicable
moment.

00:46:59.933 --> 00:47:02.733
So I always used to say that
Tender is the Night is just a

00:47:02.733 --> 00:47:05.933
real challenge to us, as much
of a challenge as Faulkner's

00:47:05.933 --> 00:47:07.167
novels are.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.078
Professor Robert
Shiller: This is,

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:07.690
as I said, my last lecture for
this course and I'm entitling

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.690
this lecture,
The Democratization of Finance.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.515
I wanted to save this to the
end because it's really about

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:20.594
looking at the broad purpose of
our financial markets and our

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:25.541
financial institutions.
Ultimately, there's only one

00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:30.200
purpose to all of this and
that's human welfare.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.367
It's people.
This should be obvious,

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:41.812
but let's not forget that
corporations exist only for the

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:45.769
benefit of people.
Normally, we say for their

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.730
owners, but we could also add
other stakeholders.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.999
But, it's people--individual
people--that matter only,

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.903
unless you want to add animals.
We have non-profits that are

00:00:58.903 --> 00:01:02.150
aimed at animal welfare as well,
so we'll include them.

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:12.046
I've made it a theme of my
recent books that finance is a

00:01:12.046 --> 00:01:17.833
powerful tool for improving
human welfare and in my latest

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:23.418
two books I emphasize what I
call the democratization of

00:01:23.418 --> 00:01:28.963
finance.
Maybe I should write this down

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:36.799
because it's a term that I like
to use--democratization of

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.160
finance--or you could say for
short,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.963
financial democracy,
but I mean something a little

00:01:44.963 --> 00:01:46.902
different.
In the 1930s,

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:52.492
people talked about financial
democracy as the shareholders

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:56.830
voting for the direction of a
corporation.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.699
I don't mean it--by that--by
democratization of finance I

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:02.980
mean bringing it to the people.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:14.826
There's been a long trend
towards democratization of

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:18.879
finance that goes back
centuries;

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:27.227
that is, originally financial
techniques were a value only to

00:02:27.227 --> 00:02:33.069
the very rich or the very
sophisticated.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.766
In 1780, the President of
Harvard College had his

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:44.938
paycheck--I think it was
President Lamont--indexed to

00:02:44.938 --> 00:02:47.294
inflation.
[Correction:

00:02:47.294 --> 00:02:49.148
It was President Samuel
Langdon.]

00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:52.680
I've been trying to figure out
if anyone else in the world had

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.097
ever had a CPI indexed labor
contract and I've not been able

00:02:56.097 --> 00:03:00.189
to discover any other example.
That was 1780.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:05.237
So, there was one person in the
world who had an inflation index

00:03:05.237 --> 00:03:08.460
employment contract.
Funny, who was it?

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.770
It was the President of
Harvard, so not a random person.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.881
As time goes by,
we have more and more spread of

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:22.693
these concepts.
I make it as a mission in two

00:03:22.693 --> 00:03:29.030
of my books, New Financial
Order, which is on reserve,

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.397
and my new book,
which I'll write here,

00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:37.361
Subprime Solution,
which is not on reserve because

00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:42.147
I haven't finished it yet,
but it will be out in--it will

00:03:42.147 --> 00:03:45.589
be sometime this summer.
It will be available in

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.888
bookstores.
Apparently, well--so,

00:03:48.888 --> 00:03:55.247
the theme is that--in both
these books--is that a lot of

00:03:55.247 --> 00:04:02.300
our problems can be solved by
extending--continuing this trend

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.810
toward democratization of
finance.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.280
We have problems with
inequality--economic inequality.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.660
This is, I think,
probably the most important

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.716
issue facing advanced countries
today--that is that we are not

00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:35.104
sharing income equally.
There are a remarkable number

00:04:35.104 --> 00:04:41.520
of poor people and a small very
elite group who are making

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.074
hundreds of millions of dollars.
In most countries of the world,

00:04:48.074 --> 00:04:52.393
inequality is getting worse.
This applies both to the

00:04:52.393 --> 00:04:56.373
advanced countries like the
United States and to the

00:04:56.373 --> 00:04:59.730
emerging countries like China
and India.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.358
It's not altogether bad because
part of the reason inequality is

00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:08.839
getting worse is that they're
suddenly getting rich people.

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:12.413
If everyone's getting better
off, you could say,

00:05:12.413 --> 00:05:17.562
what's the problem?
In many ways that is the right

00:05:17.562 --> 00:05:23.602
answer, but I think that we
can't tolerate excessive

00:05:23.602 --> 00:05:27.327
inequality.
The beauty of it is that the

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:31.683
very same capitalism that has
been generating inequality has

00:05:31.683 --> 00:05:36.726
solutions for it.
Many of our venerable economic

00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:42.909
institutions that we already
have are working against

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:50.399
inequality, so I'll mention just
for example life insurance.

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:55.440
That helps alleviate inequality
by eliminating one important

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.766
cause of inequality.
A lot of poor people,

00:05:58.766 --> 00:06:00.900
traditionally,
are people who've

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.481
lost--families that have lost
one of the two parents,

00:06:04.481 --> 00:06:07.029
either the mother or the
father.

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:12.914
Of course, that puts the family
in stress because they have just

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:17.401
lost half of their adults.
If you have life insurance,

00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:21.455
that solves that.
Another source of inequality is

00:06:21.455 --> 00:06:23.990
solved by health insurance.

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.857
An important cause of
inequality is somebody gets

00:06:31.857 --> 00:06:37.454
sick, so they are unable to earn
an income and they end up in

00:06:37.454 --> 00:06:43.372
disastrous economic situations.
Another one is disability

00:06:43.372 --> 00:06:44.540
insurance.

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:54.370
Disability insurance protects
you against something like an

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.660
accident that causes you to
become unable to hold a job;

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.170
that tends to be a lifetime
thing.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.519
Disability insurance is a
lifetime insurance contract;

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:08.089
you pay for it while you're
healthy.

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:14.349
If you become disabled,
you get support for the rest of

00:07:14.349 --> 00:07:18.206
your life.
These are just some examples of

00:07:18.206 --> 00:07:22.502
how inequality is already being
dealt with through risk

00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:27.514
management institutions and why
finance--I always lump insurance

00:07:27.514 --> 00:07:31.569
in--these are all insurance,
but I lump that in with finance

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:33.830
as risk management and why
they're so important.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.165
We still see inequality getting
worse, so I think that is a

00:07:43.165 --> 00:07:48.139
challenge toward improving risk
management institutions.

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:53.103
The subprime crisis that we're
in now is really substantially

00:07:53.103 --> 00:07:57.569
due to failures of our risk
management institutions.

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:02.728
Notably, we have had a failure
to provide institutions to help

00:08:02.728 --> 00:08:07.209
people to diversify their own
household portfolios.

00:08:07.209 --> 00:08:12.541
So, people who bought a house
would have been in a highly

00:08:12.541 --> 00:08:17.492
leveraged position and
vulnerable to risks of changes

00:08:17.492 --> 00:08:21.110
in home prices and to other
risks.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:32.505
We need to go a lot further.
Now, part of this theme of

00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:37.010
democratization of finance is
that we have to pay respect to

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.690
behavioral finance.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.570
That's because people
don't--especially the less

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.918
educated or less capable
people--don't always make

00:08:52.918 --> 00:08:57.000
optimal use of financial
instruments like,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.707
for example, insurance.
If people don't make use of

00:09:05.707 --> 00:09:12.029
risk management contracts,
then we have a problem.

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:16.378
What we have to do going
forward in the future is design

00:09:16.378 --> 00:09:21.360
our risk management contracts to
work better for real people.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:31.119
That requires what they call in
the engineering department,

00:09:31.119 --> 00:09:39.870
human factors engineering,
but I'll add financial.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.173
Financial engineering is a term
sometimes used in a disparaging

00:09:43.173 --> 00:09:46.157
term for people who invent
things that are just a bit too

00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:47.936
complicated.
But usually,

00:09:47.936 --> 00:09:52.644
the word financial engineering
is used approvingly to refer to

00:09:52.644 --> 00:09:57.584
people's efforts to make finance
work even better than before--to

00:09:57.584 --> 00:10:01.289
make progress in our financial
institution.

00:10:01.289 --> 00:10:07.810
One of the themes of my--of
this book and this book--is that

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:12.120
we have a lot of progress to be
made,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.760
but I think it has to be taking
account of our better financial

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:25.080
institutions--knowledge of
financial theory and behavior.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.000
What I wanted to talk
about--actually,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.919
this lecture--I have several
parts.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:32.663
I wanted to talk first about
social insurance,

00:10:32.663 --> 00:10:36.990
which is not normally covered
in a finance course.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.559
It seems to be so relevant that
I want to talk about it.

00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:46.108
Social insurance refers to
government programs that insure

00:10:46.108 --> 00:10:50.094
people against risk.
I wanted to talk about the

00:10:50.094 --> 00:10:53.782
extremely important risk
management programs that the

00:10:53.782 --> 00:10:57.871
government has instituted.
I'm going to talk especially

00:10:57.871 --> 00:11:02.152
about bankruptcy and bailouts
because they're relevant right

00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:04.944
now,
particularly relevant right now

00:11:04.944 --> 00:11:10.822
with the subprime crisis.
Then I wanted to conclude this

00:11:10.822 --> 00:11:18.615
lecture with some thoughts about
financial careers and about

00:11:18.615 --> 00:11:21.758
morality.
I wanted--I talked about that

00:11:21.758 --> 00:11:24.185
in the first lecture.
Maybe I should have talked more

00:11:24.185 --> 00:11:28.039
consistently about it.
Young people are thinking about

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:33.141
careers and I think that,
ultimately, I give you credit

00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:39.000
for wondering about the moral
purpose of different careers.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.861
I think finance has a somewhat
tarnished reputation,

00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:47.580
but I think that's really
undeserved.

00:11:51.559 --> 00:11:55.237
I guess people in finance get
into controversial positions

00:11:55.237 --> 00:11:59.238
more so than people who are in
other occupations that don't put

00:11:59.238 --> 00:12:03.690
them in these moral dilemmas and
sometimes they can behave badly.

00:12:08.169 --> 00:12:09.929
I don't actually claim to have
answers.

00:12:09.929 --> 00:12:11.870
You should take a philosophy
course.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:18.510
I won't give you answers to all
these ethical questions,

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:25.151
but what I want to do is at
least raise them and think a

00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:31.429
little bit about how they relate
to this course.

00:12:31.429 --> 00:12:35.637
The first principle of--I want
to come back now to what I said

00:12:35.637 --> 00:12:39.500
I would talk about--namely,
the role of the government in

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.880
risk management.

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.742
I think it would be a mistake
to ignore this because David

00:12:51.742 --> 00:12:57.069
Moss, who actually got his PhD
in history from Yale and I

00:12:57.069 --> 00:13:00.970
talked to him when he was still
here,

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.790
wrote a book,
When All Else Fails.

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.899
It was a history of risk
management in the U.S.

00:13:14.899 --> 00:13:16.767
This is about ten years ago
this book came--or eight

00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:18.672
years--I forget exactly,
sometime in the last decade.

00:13:18.672 --> 00:13:20.063
[David A.
Moss, When All Else Fails:

00:13:20.063 --> 00:13:22.041
Government as the Ultimate Risk
Manager, Cambridge:

00:13:22.041 --> 00:13:23.540
Harvard University Press,
2002.]

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.106
He makes the argument that
really every government--he

00:13:26.106 --> 00:13:29.047
focuses on the U.S.,
but every government has a risk

00:13:29.047 --> 00:13:33.299
management role.
Much of what governments do is

00:13:33.299 --> 00:13:39.149
to do risk management,
especially modern governments.

00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:44.452
That wasn't maybe true so much
before, before the end of the

00:13:44.452 --> 00:13:48.799
nineteenth century.
The governments have gotten in

00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:51.669
increasingly into risk
management.

00:13:51.669 --> 00:14:04.566
The first example I would give
is the progressive income tax or

00:14:04.566 --> 00:14:12.328
graduated income tax,
as it was called by Adam Smith

00:14:12.328 --> 00:14:17.490
in 1776, in his book,
The Wealth of Nations.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:21.001
He said that maybe we should
have a tax on incomes and the

00:14:21.001 --> 00:14:24.267
tax on incomes should be
graduated so that people with

00:14:24.267 --> 00:14:27.655
higher incomes pay a higher
fraction of their income and

00:14:27.655 --> 00:14:30.120
that would help reduce
inequality.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.204
Smith, although he raised it in
that famous book in 1776,

00:14:35.204 --> 00:14:39.289
he then quickly dismissed it as
unworkable.

00:14:39.289 --> 00:14:42.899
He said, if we had an income
tax it would be,

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:47.575
quote, "a tax on conscience,"
meaning that only the honest

00:14:47.575 --> 00:14:52.005
people would pay it because it
was impossible to verify

00:14:52.005 --> 00:14:55.875
anyone's income;
income is too complicated to

00:14:55.875 --> 00:15:00.370
measure.
Maybe he was right.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:08.292
The first income tax--it was
either the UK or Holland at the

00:15:08.292 --> 00:15:12.590
end of the eighteenth century.

00:15:16.159 --> 00:15:20.563
They had small income taxes and
they were progressive,

00:15:20.563 --> 00:15:23.679
but they were a beginning.
The U.S.

00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:29.899
experimented with an income tax
in the 1860s and abandoned it.

00:15:29.899 --> 00:15:37.341
The original experiments were
all only marginally successful,

00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:42.302
but the U.S.
finally got an income tax in

00:15:42.302 --> 00:15:49.000
1913 and at a very low level,
but this is the U.S.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.590
It ultimately became very
important.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:56.612
After World War II,
the top marginal tax bracket

00:15:56.612 --> 00:16:01.527
rose above 90%,
so it became a very significant

00:16:01.527 --> 00:16:06.537
redistributor of income.
Ultimately, it's gone way back

00:16:06.537 --> 00:16:08.545
down now;
we've reversed it,

00:16:08.545 --> 00:16:11.960
but ultimately it's a risk
management device.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.819
What it means is that if you do
very poorly, you don't pay any

00:16:16.819 --> 00:16:19.130
taxes and you get benefits.

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:28.650
We also--I might add to it--we
have a progressive income tax

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:34.185
that finances education for
everyone--universal education

00:16:34.185 --> 00:16:38.830
and other social services and
public goods.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:46.251
So, that is a risk management
device and it works despite

00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:53.539
limitations of human behavior
because it's automatic;

00:16:53.539 --> 00:16:56.600
it's imposed on you,
so nobody can forget about it.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.700
It becomes a universal risk
management device.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.344
In some sense,
it's the most important risk

00:17:02.344 --> 00:17:06.500
management device of all because
it deals at the very low level.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:12.534
Starting in around the--well,
I guess you could go back to

00:17:12.534 --> 00:17:16.557
Milton Friedman,
who was a conservative

00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:22.909
economist who started advocating
a negative income tax in the

00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:25.522
1940s.
He actually,

00:17:25.522 --> 00:17:30.779
in his 1963 book,
Capitalism and Freedom,

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:37.177
he advocated it more strongly.
That's the usual source--that

00:17:37.177 --> 00:17:43.152
we should have a negative tax on
low-income people to bring their

00:17:43.152 --> 00:17:46.980
income up to a good substantial
level;

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.559
so, that was the negative
income tax.

00:17:52.559 --> 00:17:57.569
It sounded like a very negative
tax on low income;

00:17:57.569 --> 00:18:02.387
it sounded like a very
controversial crazy idea when he

00:18:02.387 --> 00:18:07.027
launched it, but crazy ideas
have a way of eventually

00:18:07.027 --> 00:18:12.040
becoming standard.
The United States adopted--and

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.616
it is now fairly
significant--something called

00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:22.390
the Earned Income Tax Credit,
which is a negative income tax

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.490
for low-income families.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:34.989
It emerged from
thinking--EITC--Earned Income

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:38.810
Tax Credit.
If you are a family with

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:42.487
children with income very low,
like under $10,000,

00:18:42.487 --> 00:18:46.538
you'll get a substantial
negative tax--several thousand

00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:49.690
dollars--and that is risk
management.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:54.031
It means that anybody whose
income falls below very low

00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:58.694
is--it's kind of like an income
insurance scheme run by the

00:18:58.694 --> 00:19:02.909
government.
The concern about all of these

00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:06.420
schemes, however,
is moral hazard.

00:19:11.339 --> 00:19:15.583
If you have an earned income
taxed credit--it's kind of

00:19:15.583 --> 00:19:20.405
designed around moral hazard.
Instead of having welfare,

00:19:20.405 --> 00:19:25.817
welfare is a less--that's just
a gift to someone who doesn't

00:19:25.817 --> 00:19:29.670
have any job at all,
who has no income.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:35.609
Then, that moral welfare tends
to lead to a moral hazard

00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:38.382
problem.
If the government says,

00:19:38.382 --> 00:19:42.578
if you don't have a job we'll
support you, that encourages

00:19:42.578 --> 00:19:45.670
people to say,
okay I don't have a job.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:49.473
But, the earned income tax
credit is different because it's

00:19:49.473 --> 00:19:51.900
a negative tax rate on your
income.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.469
You have to have income in
order to get anything,

00:19:55.469 --> 00:19:58.369
so you have to get a job to get
EITC.

00:19:58.369 --> 00:20:01.440
The more you earn,
the more EITC,

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:07.198
up to a limit for low levels of
income--the more negative tax

00:20:07.198 --> 00:20:10.898
you get.
The thing that we're--what

00:20:10.898 --> 00:20:16.877
we're doing as time goes by is
we're getting a clearer picture

00:20:16.877 --> 00:20:22.463
of how to design risk management
contracts for the general

00:20:22.463 --> 00:20:26.239
public.
The EITC was invented in the

00:20:26.239 --> 00:20:29.905
'70s in the U.S.;
it was sponsored by Senator

00:20:29.905 --> 00:20:32.861
Russell Long.
It is now being copied around

00:20:32.861 --> 00:20:35.970
the world;
although, I guess there were

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.690
earlier antecedents,
but the U.S.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.750
was the first country to do
EITC.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:45.410
The other--I wanted just to
remind you of the different

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:49.069
kinds of risk management that
the government offers.

00:20:49.069 --> 00:21:00.420
One important part of it is
Social Security.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.640
I want to go back to the
original Social Security system;

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:11.409
it was in Germany under Otto
Von Bismarck that the first

00:21:11.409 --> 00:21:15.710
Social Security systems were
developed.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:21.065
It was considered a highly
radical idea in the 1880s

00:21:21.065 --> 00:21:24.950
when--I'll put this down in
German,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:35.974
in case some of you can
understand this--1883

00:21:35.974 --> 00:21:45.495
Krankenversicherung.
Health insurance was founded

00:21:45.495 --> 00:21:49.038
nationally in Germany,
so it was a government

00:21:49.038 --> 00:21:54.766
mandatory program;
everybody in Germany had to

00:21:54.766 --> 00:22:01.260
contribute to health insurance.
German words are very long;

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.534
they run them together;
I ran out of room to write

00:22:03.534 --> 00:22:11.327
Krankenversicherung.
In 1884, Unfallversich

00:22:11.327 --> 00:22:23.579
erung--unfall means
accident, like a fall;

00:22:23.579 --> 00:22:26.589
Versicherung means
insurance.

00:22:26.589 --> 00:22:31.953
The government created an
accident referring to workplace

00:22:31.953 --> 00:22:37.220
accident insurance and it
was--the German government had

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:43.063
it--it was an arrangement that
made it mandatory for employers

00:22:43.063 --> 00:22:48.139
to buy insurance against
injuries to people who worked

00:22:48.139 --> 00:22:55.132
there.
Then they had in 1889

00:22:55.132 --> 00:23:05.349
Altersversicherung.
This isn't supposed to be a

00:23:05.349 --> 00:23:10.046
German lesson,
but I like to put it this way

00:23:10.046 --> 00:23:15.600
because it suggests its origin.
This was old age insurance;

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.300
alter means old.

00:23:21.009 --> 00:23:24.002
So, old age insurance was
generated for the whole country

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:26.140
of Germany and,
at this point in 1889,

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.130
Germany was the only country to
have a social insurance program.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.439
Shortly after the turn of the
century, Lloyd George,

00:23:33.439 --> 00:23:35.710
who was Prime Minister of the
UK,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.230
traveled to Germany and looked
at their system and was very

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.984
much impressed and thought--he
said one thing he noticed about

00:23:44.984 --> 00:23:48.619
Germany,
there are no beggars.

00:23:48.619 --> 00:23:52.037
Normally, in London you
couldn't walk down the street

00:23:52.037 --> 00:23:56.112
without seeing somebody who was
sitting there holding out a tin

00:23:56.112 --> 00:24:00.450
cup who had no legs or mothers
with children who were orphans.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:06.184
He said, it's gone in Germany.
So, he became convinced that

00:24:06.184 --> 00:24:10.228
the UK should follow the lead.
This was copied over the whole

00:24:10.228 --> 00:24:13.000
word and it's virtually
everywhere now.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.418
Some less developed countries
haven't gotten there yet,

00:24:17.418 --> 00:24:20.200
but this is where they're
going.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.279
I wanted to quote Gustav
Schmoller, who is a German

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:27.820
economist in the 1880s.

00:24:33.319 --> 00:24:38.406
In the early twentieth century,
he wrote some memoirs about his

00:24:38.406 --> 00:24:42.589
life and the life of other
economists in Germany.

00:24:42.589 --> 00:24:47.573
He said "The triumph of
insurance in every imaginable

00:24:47.573 --> 00:24:52.103
area was one of the century's,
[meaning the nineteenth

00:24:52.103 --> 00:24:54.266
century's]
great advances in social

00:24:54.266 --> 00:24:57.114
progress.
It was an entirely logical

00:24:57.114 --> 00:25:01.444
development that insurance
should spread from the upper

00:25:01.444 --> 00:25:04.941
classes to the lower classes;
that it had to attempt as far

00:25:04.941 --> 00:25:06.580
as possible, to eliminate
poverty and that the older

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.412
charitable relief funds for the
workers were more and more

00:25:08.412 --> 00:25:10.211
constructed on the sound
principle of insurance." [Gustav

00:25:10.211 --> 00:25:11.272
Schmoller,
Charakterbilder,

00:25:11.272 --> 00:25:12.428
Leipzig, Verlag von Duncker,
1913, p.

00:25:12.428 --> 00:25:15.340
57 (Shiller's translation).
The problem with charity is

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.220
that it tends to be whimsical
and capricious.

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:24.693
If you're relying on charity to
resolve problems of poverty,

00:25:24.693 --> 00:25:31.386
it's going to be applied very
unevenly and it would be salient

00:25:31.386 --> 00:25:35.358
examples of poverty.
Like, if a child is suddenly

00:25:35.358 --> 00:25:38.036
stricken with some unusual
illness and it gets written up

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:41.886
in the newspapers,
then generous contributions

00:25:41.886 --> 00:25:47.895
would come pouring into that
child, but other children who

00:25:47.895 --> 00:25:53.045
are not so blessed get nothing.
In the United States,

00:25:53.045 --> 00:25:57.294
we were about the last country
to jump onto the bandwagon,

00:25:57.294 --> 00:26:01.170
begun in Germany--partly I
guess because the U.S.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.700
is more free enterprise in its
orientation.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.500
Maybe it doesn't like to adopt
ideas from Europe.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.039
It wasn't until the Great
Depression that the U.S.

00:26:12.039 --> 00:26:16.494
adopted
Altersversicherung and we

00:26:16.494 --> 00:26:22.319
still haven't adopted
Krankenversicherung;

00:26:22.319 --> 00:26:25.549
we still don't have a national
health insurance.

00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:28.812
We have Medicare and Medicaid,
but they don't apply to

00:26:28.812 --> 00:26:31.361
everyone.
We have about forty million

00:26:31.361 --> 00:26:34.411
uninsured Americans with no
health insurance,

00:26:34.411 --> 00:26:41.069
so we're still not there yet;
maybe we'll get there.

00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:47.885
I wanted to talk about some of
the important successes

00:26:47.885 --> 00:26:53.799
that--the Social Security System
in the U.S.

00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:58.130
is our copy of the German
system.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:04.265
Social Security started in
1935--that was about fifty years

00:27:04.265 --> 00:27:09.804
after the Germans invented it.
It's remarkable how similar the

00:27:09.804 --> 00:27:14.182
idea that we have done is and it
stays--we really have something

00:27:14.182 --> 00:27:17.380
like the 1889 German system in
place today.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:23.214
What it did is it created a
system of contributions

00:27:23.214 --> 00:27:27.065
to--right now,
when you get a job,

00:27:27.065 --> 00:27:32.900
you have to pay 6.2%--that's on
your pay stub.

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:38.500
6.2% is taken out as your
contribution to Social Security

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.799
and then your employer pays
another 6.2%.

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:47.733
So, 12.4% of your income goes
to Social Security and those are

00:27:47.733 --> 00:27:52.748
thought of as contributions to
an insurance scheme for your--it

00:27:52.748 --> 00:27:58.970
has three components.
It's called OASDI;

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:06.933
OA stands for old age,
S stands for survivors,

00:28:06.933 --> 00:28:14.190
and DI stands for disability
insurance.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:19.670
Well, they're all insurance.
You are--it's mandatory;

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.900
you are paying a lot into this
system.

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:26.440
You're paying--the fact that
your employer pays half of it is

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.374
perhaps misleading,
so it's really like 12% of your

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:31.500
income is forced to go into an
insurance scheme;

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.460
that's big.
Now, there's a cut off though.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.967
After you reach I think it's
around $95,000,

00:28:36.967 --> 00:28:38.717
[correction:
$102,000 for 2008]

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:42.526
you don't have to pay anymore,
but for most people it's 12% of

00:28:42.526 --> 00:28:45.000
their income is going to Social
Security.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.559
What do they get for it?
They get a pension when they're

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:51.832
old and it's guaranteed for the
rest of your life and these

00:28:51.832 --> 00:28:54.880
other things a lot of people
don't even know about;

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:56.759
you don't even know that you've
got them.

00:28:56.759 --> 00:28:59.559
Survivor's Insurance is a life
insurance program;

00:28:59.559 --> 00:29:05.430
this was actually added in 1939
with amendments.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:10.049
I guess maybe disability was
added at that time too.

00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:13.015
What it means is,
if you are under a certain

00:29:13.015 --> 00:29:16.049
age--I think it's 18--if your
parents die,

00:29:16.049 --> 00:29:19.265
the government will--or one of
your parents dies--the

00:29:19.265 --> 00:29:22.789
government will pay money to the
family to support you.

00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:25.680
It's life insurance offered by
the government.

00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.869
Why did the government get into
this?

00:29:27.869 --> 00:29:31.891
Well, the problem was--it's
behavioral finance again--that

00:29:31.891 --> 00:29:35.559
while wealthy people tended to
get life insurance,

00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:40.208
the general mass of people were
not because of some behavioral

00:29:40.208 --> 00:29:42.429
problem.
They just didn't see the value

00:29:42.429 --> 00:29:46.016
of it--didn't understand it.
Disability insurance means that

00:29:46.016 --> 00:29:50.158
if you work and you have an
accident, then you can no longer

00:29:50.158 --> 00:29:52.434
work;
you start collecting Social

00:29:52.434 --> 00:29:55.168
Security.
Normally, you don't get

00:29:55.168 --> 00:30:00.824
the--old age until the age 62 or
65, but disability you can get

00:30:00.824 --> 00:30:04.200
at any age if you become
disabled.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.005
It's funny, I think a lot of
people don't even know they have

00:30:08.005 --> 00:30:10.372
this.
These institutions operate so

00:30:10.372 --> 00:30:13.487
quietly, partly the
government--they called this

00:30:13.487 --> 00:30:17.000
Survivors' Insurance when they
created it in 1939.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.637
I was wondering why don't they
call it life insurance,

00:30:20.637 --> 00:30:23.120
that's what it is.
Life insurance is something

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.299
that pays the survivors of a
family member who dies.

00:30:25.299 --> 00:30:28.387
I think they didn't want to
call it life insurance because

00:30:28.387 --> 00:30:30.769
they didn't want to threaten the
industry.

00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:32.640
There's a whole life insurance
industry.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.232
The government was going it in
a big way to create a product,

00:30:36.232 --> 00:30:39.579
which was mandatory,
but they didn't want to upset

00:30:39.579 --> 00:30:43.009
the life--so they called it
something different.

00:30:43.009 --> 00:30:45.366
You can get a life insurance
salesman who will sell you life

00:30:45.366 --> 00:30:47.842
insurance and not even mention
that you've got a policy already

00:30:47.842 --> 00:30:50.700
whether you want it or not;
they would just be offering

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.260
something to add to that.

00:30:55.609 --> 00:31:03.511
What also they did starting in
the 1930s--it was originally

00:31:03.511 --> 00:31:08.279
called Aid to Dependent
Children,

00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:14.029
but they changed it to Aid to
Families with Dependent Children

00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:18.460
and that was a separate program
beyond these.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:26.087
The parents didn't have to be
disabled or old or anything like

00:31:26.087 --> 00:31:31.590
that to get this and that
started in 1935.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:35.103
That's our welfare system;
it was for parents that

00:31:35.103 --> 00:31:37.948
couldn't earn enough money--if
you have a mother,

00:31:37.948 --> 00:31:41.622
a single mother with no husband
and the husband--or the husband

00:31:41.622 --> 00:31:47.692
just can't make any money,
she would get aid for herself

00:31:47.692 --> 00:31:52.158
and the children.
That, however,

00:31:52.158 --> 00:31:58.329
was abolished in 1996 because
of moral hazard.

00:31:58.329 --> 00:32:04.473
The aid to families with
dependent children was created

00:32:04.473 --> 00:32:11.414
in 1935 with little attention to
the amount of moral hazard it

00:32:11.414 --> 00:32:17.104
might eventually create.
There grew an increasing

00:32:17.104 --> 00:32:22.683
problem of welfare dependency.
You would have families that

00:32:22.683 --> 00:32:27.536
had lived on AFDC their whole
lives and their grandparent's

00:32:27.536 --> 00:32:30.799
lives and their grandparent's
lives.

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:39.627
Public opinion turned against
that and it was in 1996 and we

00:32:39.627 --> 00:32:46.660
had a Welfare Reform Act that
abolished AFDC.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:52.546
It was a Republican bill,
but it was signed by the

00:32:52.546 --> 00:32:59.857
Democratic President Clinton.
That eliminated Federal--well,

00:32:59.857 --> 00:33:06.555
essentially they ended the
welfare program started in the

00:33:06.555 --> 00:33:12.303
Depression.
There still is some welfare,

00:33:12.303 --> 00:33:19.139
but there's a lifetime
five-year limit on actual

00:33:19.139 --> 00:33:23.161
welfare;
after you've been collecting it

00:33:23.161 --> 00:33:26.130
for five years,
you are disqualified.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:31.520
It denied welfare to immigrants
who are not citizens and it

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.539
limited food stamps to
unemployed, childless adults.

00:33:36.539 --> 00:33:43.954
I think that as we move ahead
we are becoming increasingly

00:33:43.954 --> 00:33:50.068
aware of how to design
institutions around human

00:33:50.068 --> 00:33:54.188
glitches.
So, the Welfare Reform Act--I

00:33:54.188 --> 00:33:59.045
don't know if it was the right
policy, but it was trying to

00:33:59.045 --> 00:34:02.059
eliminate a moral hazard
problem.

00:34:02.059 --> 00:34:05.229
We have instead of--we've
replaced the aid to families

00:34:05.229 --> 00:34:08.340
with dependent children with a
more generous EITC.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.250
You see that it has very
different moral hazard

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.288
implications.
To get Earned Income Tax Credit

00:34:14.288 --> 00:34:18.060
you've got to have a job and it
can't just be a token job

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:22.034
because you don't--it says the
negative tax is a function of

00:34:22.034 --> 00:34:26.524
your income.
I take this as signs of past

00:34:26.524 --> 00:34:31.659
progress that will continue in
the future.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:37.412
I wanted to talk about
bankruptcy briefly here because

00:34:37.412 --> 00:34:43.490
that is something that I
mentioned is very important risk

00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:49.893
management device and it's of
relevance right now in time of

00:34:49.893 --> 00:34:55.908
financial crises.
The United States did not have

00:34:55.908 --> 00:35:01.538
a bankruptcy law at the federal
level, generally,

00:35:01.538 --> 00:35:05.746
until 1898.
During the nineteenth century,

00:35:05.746 --> 00:35:10.624
there were repeated financial
crises that led to temporary

00:35:10.624 --> 00:35:13.232
bankruptcy laws.
What happened was,

00:35:13.232 --> 00:35:16.344
like what we're seeing right
now, there was some financial

00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:19.674
crisis and it caused people to
lose their jobs for no fault of

00:35:19.674 --> 00:35:22.349
their own and they couldn't pay
their debts.

00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:26.114
Laws back then were often very
harsh and they would send people

00:35:26.114 --> 00:35:29.402
to debtor's prison.
I think the enlightened view

00:35:29.402 --> 00:35:31.990
gradually developed--this is
crazy;

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:37.550
some person is trying hard;
there's a big financial crisis;

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:42.308
makes bad investments;
then, it can't pay debts and we

00:35:42.308 --> 00:35:45.519
put this guy in jail.
That's crazy.

00:35:45.519 --> 00:35:51.688
In fact, there should be some
other method that deals better

00:35:51.688 --> 00:35:53.570
with bankruptcy.

00:35:57.969 --> 00:36:02.820
There were numerous bankruptcy
laws but notable was the 1841

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:07.259
law, which for a temporary
period gave--this is after a

00:36:07.259 --> 00:36:10.630
financial crisis--gave a fresh
start.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:15.099
They said someone declaring
bankruptcy can wipe out all

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:20.149
debts and not go to jail and as
long as they draw their wealth

00:36:20.149 --> 00:36:25.198
down to zero they could have a
fresh start and go back to life

00:36:25.198 --> 00:36:30.115
normally.
That kind of idea has gradually

00:36:30.115 --> 00:36:36.991
been--and it's now--now it's
part of our general assumption

00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:41.769
about bankruptcies.
I mentioned that 1898 was the

00:36:41.769 --> 00:36:45.706
landmark bankruptcy law.
This is the first time that we

00:36:45.706 --> 00:36:49.838
had bankruptcy enshrined as an
institution that lasts all the

00:36:49.838 --> 00:36:51.700
time.
It's not just during financial

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:55.496
crisis;
you can at any time declare

00:36:55.496 --> 00:37:00.730
bankruptcy as a way to protect
yourself.

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:05.817
There was another landmark.
This is a landmark bankruptcy

00:37:05.817 --> 00:37:11.751
law and there was another one in
1978--another landmark

00:37:11.751 --> 00:37:16.364
bankruptcy bill,
which made it even easier,

00:37:16.364 --> 00:37:20.829
much easier for people to
declare bankruptcy.

00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:23.838
As a result,
especially after 1978,

00:37:23.838 --> 00:37:28.439
bankruptcies became very
commonly used ways to manage

00:37:28.439 --> 00:37:31.889
extreme outcomes in one's
finances.

00:37:31.889 --> 00:37:36.117
In fact, recently,
since 1978, there are typically

00:37:36.117 --> 00:37:39.223
over a million
bankruptcies--personal

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:43.189
bankruptcies--a year.
It's a little known fact that

00:37:43.189 --> 00:37:46.932
there are more bankruptcies than
divorces and you may wonder,

00:37:46.932 --> 00:37:50.659
well how can that be?
I don't hear about bankruptcies;

00:37:50.659 --> 00:37:53.300
you hear about divorces all the
time.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:56.929
I think the reason you don't
hear about bankruptcies is that

00:37:56.929 --> 00:38:00.701
nobody needs to tell you.
You don't come across saying

00:38:00.701 --> 00:38:03.190
to--you ask someone,
what's new?

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:08.010
Oh, I just declared bankruptcy.
They don't do that.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.340
They don't do that about
divorces either,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.269
but the problem with divorces
is they can't cover it up.

00:38:11.269 --> 00:38:17.172
Everybody knows you've gotten a
divorce, so we hear a lot more

00:38:17.172 --> 00:38:22.010
about them, but bankruptcies are
very important.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:28.715
The other bill that is very
important is 2005 and that

00:38:28.715 --> 00:38:35.139
reverses some of the 1978 bill.
We've been pulling back;

00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:41.876
maybe 1978 was too generous,
but I just wanted to give you

00:38:41.876 --> 00:38:46.250
some clue about what bankruptcy
is.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:50.035
If you--there are three
important kinds of bankruptcy

00:38:50.035 --> 00:38:54.039
and they refer to chapters of
the United States Code.

00:38:54.039 --> 00:38:57.848
There's Chapter 7
Bankruptcy--you should know this

00:38:57.848 --> 00:39:02.123
because half of you are going to
declare bankruptcy some

00:39:02.123 --> 00:39:05.348
day--maybe not.
We hope that you get an

00:39:05.348 --> 00:39:09.834
education in finance and few of
you will declare bankruptcy,

00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:13.940
but some of you are going to be
going through this.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:25.466
Chapter 11 and Chapter 13.
Just so you'll know in advance,

00:39:25.466 --> 00:39:31.892
before you actually do this,
Chapter 7 is the liquidation

00:39:31.892 --> 00:39:37.170
form and this is where you say,
this is it;

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:42.127
this is the fresh start story.
You give up everything you have

00:39:42.127 --> 00:39:45.882
to your creditors.
The bankruptcy court will

00:39:45.882 --> 00:39:51.590
divide it up among the creditors
and then you have a fresh start.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:57.590
It used to be in 1978 you could
do this every six years.

00:39:57.590 --> 00:40:01.518
So remember,
2005 thought 1978 was too

00:40:01.518 --> 00:40:06.720
lenient, so they moved it to
every eight years;

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.068
so, that's what you can do.
If you are in big

00:40:11.068 --> 00:40:14.734
trouble--you've gotten in more
debt than you can handle--what

00:40:14.734 --> 00:40:18.400
you have to do is go to a lawyer
and file for bankruptcy.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:23.710
Chapter 7 is often the favorite
thing because it gives you a

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:28.028
fresh start.
However, the 2005 law said that

00:40:28.028 --> 00:40:33.059
you can't do--as an
individual--you can't do Chapter

00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:38.880
7 unless your income is below
the median for your state,

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.809
so I guess you have to forget
Chapter 7.

00:40:41.809 --> 00:40:44.999
I'm assuming that most of you
will be making more than the

00:40:44.999 --> 00:40:47.349
median income for the state you
live in,

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:51.219
so cross Chapter 7--unless
you're really in a bad

00:40:51.219 --> 00:40:56.404
situation--cross Chapter 7 off.
Chapter 7 is for--Chapter

00:40:56.404 --> 00:41:00.139
11--companies can also do
Chapter 7.

00:41:00.139 --> 00:41:07.862
Chapter 11 is for companies and
it's a reorganization rather

00:41:07.862 --> 00:41:11.678
than liquidation.
For companies,

00:41:11.678 --> 00:41:16.519
it's a system to help them get
back on their feet.

00:41:16.519 --> 00:41:20.199
When a company files for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy,

00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:23.640
what they're saying is,
hey we can't pay;

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.159
we're out of money;
and we have all these people

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:28.992
coming to us that we owe money
to and we don't know who to pay

00:41:28.992 --> 00:41:31.559
first.
We just don't have enough money.

00:41:31.559 --> 00:41:36.495
It becomes a disorderly process
and so they go to the court for

00:41:36.495 --> 00:41:39.078
protection.
When a company runs out of

00:41:39.078 --> 00:41:42.533
money and it can't pay its
bills, then that can destroy the

00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:45.689
company immediately because
people who were delivering

00:41:45.689 --> 00:41:49.739
things to the company that they
need will stop delivering them.

00:41:49.739 --> 00:41:51.409
They say, I hear you're
bankrupt;

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:54.081
you're not going to pay us,
so we're going to stop

00:41:54.081 --> 00:41:56.760
delivering.
That can destroy the company.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.469
The idea of Chapter 11 is to
keep the company going so the

00:42:00.469 --> 00:42:03.919
court would impose some order
and allow the company to

00:42:03.919 --> 00:42:08.019
continue in business and to hold
off the creditors for now.

00:42:08.019 --> 00:42:11.547
It's ultimately in the
creditor's interest if the Court

00:42:11.547 --> 00:42:15.662
does this because they're better
off in getting their debts paid

00:42:15.662 --> 00:42:18.340
if the company is still making
money.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.120
Chapter 13 is something like
Chapter 11;

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:27.360
it's for individuals.
That's the one you're going to

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.010
be filing--let me put it that
way.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:36.010
Some of you will be filing for
Chapter 13 bankruptcy.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:39.404
What it is is that the
court--the bankruptcy

00:42:39.404 --> 00:42:44.220
court--will make adjustments and
a plan for you to pay off the

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:46.499
debts.
This is what we hope to see

00:42:46.499 --> 00:42:50.030
happen in increasing number of
cases during the current crisis.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.943
So, if somebody has taken out a
big mortgage,

00:42:52.943 --> 00:42:56.187
they've taken out car loans,
and they were kind of

00:42:56.187 --> 00:42:59.960
profligate and now there's a
problem and they can't pay on

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.920
all these,
they declare Chapter 13.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:08.377
They get a lawyer to represent
them and the court can adjust

00:43:08.377 --> 00:43:11.800
their debts but not eliminate
them.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.703
It says right now in Federal
Bankruptcy Law that they cannot

00:43:14.703 --> 00:43:17.607
adjust the mortgage on your
house, but they can adjust other

00:43:17.607 --> 00:43:19.901
debts.
This is something that we're

00:43:19.901 --> 00:43:23.826
talking about--the Congress is
talking about--changing because

00:43:23.826 --> 00:43:27.687
the mortgage on the house is a
big debt that bankruptcy ought

00:43:27.687 --> 00:43:32.039
to be able to adjust.
It hasn't happened yet.

00:43:32.039 --> 00:43:35.295
I wanted to mention something
else just so you understand what

00:43:35.295 --> 00:43:38.843
bankruptcy is.
There's something called

00:43:38.843 --> 00:43:42.789
informal bankruptcy.
What's the difference?

00:43:42.789 --> 00:43:48.460
With bankruptcy--bankruptcy is
for people who have enough

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:52.510
foresight to hire a lawyer and
go out.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.015
If you are having trouble
paying your bills,

00:43:56.015 --> 00:43:59.440
you know enough to go and hire
a lawyer.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.170
The lawyer might demand a
little money up front;

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:05.214
the lawyer has to be paid.
So, you should stop paying your

00:44:05.214 --> 00:44:09.374
bills and accumulate at least
$1,000 so you can go to a lawyer

00:44:09.374 --> 00:44:12.579
and start Chapter 13 bankruptcy
proceedings.

00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:18.341
A lot of people don't have the
ability to save $1,000 or to

00:44:18.341 --> 00:44:23.010
figure this out and they won't
call a lawyer.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.549
What is the common
thing--somebody is running up

00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:27.818
too much in credit card bills,
loses a job,

00:44:27.818 --> 00:44:30.790
creditors start calling--what
do you think happens?

00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:34.309
They don't get a lawyer;
guess what they do?

00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:41.010
They stop answering the
phone--very simple.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.162
I've run up all these debts,
the phone keeps ringing,

00:44:43.162 --> 00:44:45.522
and these nasty people keep
annoying me, so I just stopped

00:44:45.522 --> 00:44:47.699
using the phone.
In fact, I left my whole phone

00:44:47.699 --> 00:44:49.719
bill lapse;
I don't pay my phone bill.

00:44:49.719 --> 00:44:52.812
I don't even have a phone
anymore, so no one can come and

00:44:52.812 --> 00:44:55.960
get--they knock on my door and I
don't answer the door.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.650
What did courts do--what did
creditors do?

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:02.056
In the various states,
they can go to a state court

00:45:02.056 --> 00:45:05.666
and appeal to the court to
garnish your salary and you

00:45:05.666 --> 00:45:10.030
don't have to do anything;
you don't have to show up.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.517
They go to--they find out who
your employer is and then the

00:45:13.517 --> 00:45:16.944
State gives an order for the
employer to take money out of

00:45:16.944 --> 00:45:19.409
your paycheck to help pay your
debts.

00:45:19.409 --> 00:45:23.010
You never even figure out what
happened.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:25.487
In fact, you might not even
know it because you don't read

00:45:25.487 --> 00:45:27.922
your pay stub and now some of
your money is going through

00:45:27.922 --> 00:45:31.466
garnishment of your salary.
That happens,

00:45:31.466 --> 00:45:38.730
but see this is the reality of
bankruptcy.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.927
We are talking about another
revision of the Bankruptcy Bill

00:45:42.927 --> 00:45:46.769
because we're in a serious
crisis and maybe 2005 pulled

00:45:46.769 --> 00:45:49.806
back too much.
We keep waffling about how

00:45:49.806 --> 00:45:53.117
tight we want these,
but ultimately bankruptcy law

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:56.833
is very important in risk
management because this is big

00:45:56.833 --> 00:46:01.365
time risk management.
It has to be adjusted to deal

00:46:01.365 --> 00:46:04.809
with moral hazard and other
things.

00:46:04.809 --> 00:46:08.680
I just want to mention right
now, there's a bill being

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.186
proposed by our own Senator
Chris Dodd--here from

00:46:12.186 --> 00:46:17.870
Connecticut--and Barney Frank,
which is not a bankruptcy bill.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:21.196
It's a bill--a bailout.
They don't call it a bailout

00:46:21.196 --> 00:46:23.154
bill;
they say it's not a bailout,

00:46:23.154 --> 00:46:26.951
but I call it a bailout bill to
help people who can't pay their

00:46:26.951 --> 00:46:30.320
mortgages and they don't have to
declare bankruptcy.

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:36.613
What they want to do is empower
the Federal Housing

00:46:36.613 --> 00:46:43.536
Administration to guarantee
loans--to work out loans and

00:46:43.536 --> 00:46:50.460
guarantee them--and then an FHA
guarantee of loans.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.219
You don't have to declare
bank--you just have to go to

00:46:54.219 --> 00:46:57.340
your mortgage lender and say,
I can't pay;

00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:59.440
I'd like one of these FHA
workouts.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.679
Then, if--this hasn't happened
yet.

00:47:02.679 --> 00:47:05.791
This is a bill,
but if this bill passes,

00:47:05.791 --> 00:47:10.419
then there would be they said
maybe several hundred billion

00:47:10.419 --> 00:47:14.010
dollars of mortgages would be
guaranteed.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.833
Here's a typical story--might
be, you owe $300,000 on your

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:20.250
house--maybe that's too big.
You owe $100,000 on your house.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:24.492
They might lower that to
$90,000 and give a different

00:47:24.492 --> 00:47:29.305
payment schedule and then the
FHA will tell the bank that if

00:47:29.305 --> 00:47:34.200
you do this--to the bank--if you
make these adjustments,

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:39.634
we will guarantee the mortgage.
So, this is another--that is

00:47:39.634 --> 00:47:43.114
that the federal government will
pay back the mortgage if the

00:47:43.114 --> 00:47:45.364
individual doesn't,
so the government is getting

00:47:45.364 --> 00:47:47.972
into risk management;
they're managing the risks to

00:47:47.972 --> 00:47:49.370
the mortgage lenders.

00:47:53.079 --> 00:47:56.680
In my--I'll just mention one of
the ideas in my book,

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:00.285
Subprime Solution.
I'm thinking that these things

00:48:00.285 --> 00:48:03.699
have happened in history so many
times--we've had bankruptcy

00:48:03.699 --> 00:48:05.627
bills;
we've had bailouts of one sort

00:48:05.627 --> 00:48:08.326
of another.
They're very controversial

00:48:08.326 --> 00:48:12.106
because people say,
look there's a moral hazard

00:48:12.106 --> 00:48:14.163
problem.
If we're bailing out homeowners

00:48:14.163 --> 00:48:16.210
who didn't pay their mortgage,
isn't that a bad thing?

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:20.090
Also, we're doing it after the
fact.

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:25.323
Nobody explained this to the
borrowers that they'd be getting

00:48:25.323 --> 00:48:28.812
this bailout,
so isn't it unfair to maybe

00:48:28.812 --> 00:48:34.219
other people who didn't buy a
house who are more sensible?

00:48:34.219 --> 00:48:38.702
What I am proposing in
Subprime Solution is that

00:48:38.702 --> 00:48:43.766
we just have--these bailouts are
important and we have to make

00:48:43.766 --> 00:48:47.304
them work better.
So, I have something,

00:48:47.304 --> 00:48:50.893
which I call a continuous
workout mortgage,

00:48:50.893 --> 00:48:58.429
which we should move to;
this is my idea.

00:48:58.429 --> 00:49:02.099
So, I just mention one of the
ideas in my book.

00:49:02.099 --> 00:49:05.765
The way Dodd-Frank is proposing
is that people who are in

00:49:05.765 --> 00:49:08.450
difficulty would have a single
workout.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:12.540
It's just like a bankruptcy;
a bankruptcy is a single event

00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:16.010
and it occurs only once every
eight years.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:18.725
So, people who are in big
trouble get help from the

00:49:18.725 --> 00:49:20.952
government, but then it's a
one-time only,

00:49:20.952 --> 00:49:23.180
big event and only every eight
years.

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:31.274
Why don't we do it continuously?
What we want to do is have a

00:49:31.274 --> 00:49:38.847
mortgage so the balance or the
payments adjust automatically

00:49:38.847 --> 00:49:44.110
for changes in home prices or
incomes.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:59.059
That would make it--you get a
workout every month.

00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:01.133
Now that sounds kind of radical
and strange, but I don't see why

00:50:01.133 --> 00:50:03.939
we shouldn't do that,
especially if we can get

00:50:03.939 --> 00:50:08.892
markets for home prices and
incomes so that the lenders can

00:50:08.892 --> 00:50:11.993
hedge the risk.
I'm talking about private

00:50:11.993 --> 00:50:15.495
institutions offering mortgages
that build in the kind of

00:50:15.495 --> 00:50:19.184
workouts that we're doing on an
emergency basis from time to

00:50:19.184 --> 00:50:21.139
time.
Once you recognize that

00:50:21.139 --> 00:50:23.912
workouts are needed,
why don't we make it part of

00:50:23.912 --> 00:50:27.842
the structure in institutions?
Anyway, that's just a little

00:50:27.842 --> 00:50:30.659
story about what I'm doing in my
book.

00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:35.067
I said I would conclude this
lecture with some thoughts and I

00:50:35.067 --> 00:50:38.739
have fifteen minutes for
thoughts about finance.

00:50:38.739 --> 00:50:48.815
I wanted particularly to aim it
at people at your stage in the

00:50:48.815 --> 00:50:55.740
lifecycle, younger people,
because as I said at the

00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:01.204
beginning, there's--I think
people at your age are rightly

00:51:01.204 --> 00:51:07.881
concerned about purpose in life.
You are launching out onto a

00:51:07.881 --> 00:51:13.110
whole lifetime career.
I don't know how you feel;

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:17.543
I'm just guessing that a lot of
the things that you might be

00:51:17.543 --> 00:51:22.051
doing seem possibly meaningless
or at least not having enough

00:51:22.051 --> 00:51:27.435
meaning or purpose.
I think that's a good thing to

00:51:27.435 --> 00:51:30.594
worry about.
Most of the time you're taking

00:51:30.594 --> 00:51:33.796
a job, you're taking a job to do
some task that somebody wants

00:51:33.796 --> 00:51:36.997
done and it may be hard to see
how it figures into some global

00:51:36.997 --> 00:51:40.373
picture;
but, people want to do

00:51:40.373 --> 00:51:45.075
something that's good.
I wanted to come back,

00:51:45.075 --> 00:51:48.762
first of all,
to a theme that I mentioned in

00:51:48.762 --> 00:51:53.562
the first lecture and that
was--I think it's a remarkable

00:51:53.562 --> 00:51:56.440
book;
I'll put it on reserve;

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.360
I don't think I actually got it
on reserve yet.

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:11.531
Peter Unger is a philosopher
and his book is called Living

00:52:11.531 --> 00:52:17.770
High and Letting Die--that
was 1996.

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.756
What it--this is a book about
what we do in our lives--namely,

00:52:24.756 --> 00:52:27.489
that we tend to be wrapped up
in ourselves.

00:52:27.489 --> 00:52:32.187
There's--in advanced countries
like the U.S.,

00:52:32.187 --> 00:52:38.059
we're living pretty well,
but in other places people are

00:52:38.059 --> 00:52:42.329
starving or in desperate
situations.

00:52:42.329 --> 00:52:46.513
One of the moral dilemmas that
we seem to face is that you

00:52:46.513 --> 00:52:50.697
could save lives anytime you
want by just giving to one of

00:52:50.697 --> 00:52:53.860
the appropriate charities.
I'll write this down;

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:55.789
I said this on the first--I'm
repeating it.

00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:57.908
I said this in the first
lecture, but it's worth

00:52:57.908 --> 00:53:00.840
repeating.
On the first page of his book,

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:05.860
he has down an address to mail,
but you wouldn't mail anymore.

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:13.280
I'll put it down
again--http://ww

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:24.642
w.unicef.org--that's the United
Nations Children's

00:53:24.642 --> 00:53:36.699
Fund--support/in
dex.html--that's their website.

00:53:36.699 --> 00:53:39.887
He is saying,
why don't you put this book

00:53:39.887 --> 00:53:44.110
down right now and send a check
for $100 to UNICEF.

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:48.707
He estimates that that will
save thirty-three lives of

00:53:48.707 --> 00:53:52.153
children in the world.
I actually got on UNICEF's

00:53:52.153 --> 00:53:54.250
website this morning to check
this out.

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:59.614
They claim that they have--9.7
million children die every year

00:53:59.614 --> 00:54:04.363
for preventable causes--for
things that are preventable

00:54:04.363 --> 00:54:09.289
through vaccinations and
improved water supply and things

00:54:09.289 --> 00:54:13.659
that they do,
but they don't have enough

00:54:13.659 --> 00:54:15.974
money to do.
The reason I write this

00:54:15.974 --> 00:54:17.902
down--actually,
I don't know what you would do,

00:54:17.902 --> 00:54:20.039
but when I was reading the book
I was wondering,

00:54:20.039 --> 00:54:22.764
it's kind of shock to put this
down and think,

00:54:22.764 --> 00:54:25.550
I could save lives by just a
check for $100.

00:54:29.010 --> 00:54:30.895
I didn't do it and so I
thought--that really made an

00:54:30.895 --> 00:54:33.150
impression on me because I just
continued to read the book.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:35.558
I never--so,
finally when I reread it the

00:54:35.558 --> 00:54:39.050
third time, I got on the website
and I contributed $100.

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:44.719
Then, I have this moral dilemma;
why did I stop at $100?

00:54:44.719 --> 00:54:50.281
Because I could go way beyond
$100 and if all these people

00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:54.380
that are dying,
why am I not doing that?

00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:58.323
You start to think of
justifications and excuses that

00:54:58.323 --> 00:55:01.854
come to your mind.
Maybe you don't want to read

00:55:01.854 --> 00:55:05.524
this book because he shoots them
all down--all these

00:55:05.524 --> 00:55:11.823
justifications.
One of the justifications is

00:55:11.823 --> 00:55:15.835
futility.
You say, well these poor people

00:55:15.835 --> 00:55:19.783
in these less developed
countries--you really can't help

00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:24.090
them anyway because it'll all
get lost or the population will

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:27.680
increase and there will be more
dying people.

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.059
Anyway, he dismisses that;
you have to read it.

00:55:31.059 --> 00:55:36.598
It's a rationalization that we
don't spend too much money--too

00:55:36.598 --> 00:55:39.587
much time on.
We don't dwell on it but we

00:55:39.587 --> 00:55:42.300
assume that it's futile and so
we ignore it.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:47.268
Another one is that it's very
difficult to be a truly moral

00:55:47.268 --> 00:55:49.937
person.
I would have to give--if I

00:55:49.937 --> 00:55:53.879
really thought about what
was--the terrible things that

00:55:53.879 --> 00:55:57.164
were happening,
I would have to give 90% of my

00:55:57.164 --> 00:56:00.127
income.
That's so--I'm not going to do

00:56:00.127 --> 00:56:02.980
that, so maybe I just won't do
anything.

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:08.247
So, people make--what he
illustrates in this book is,

00:56:08.247 --> 00:56:12.906
there's a lot of casual
thinking that we use to

00:56:12.906 --> 00:56:18.983
justify--to create an illusion
of innocence that we feel that

00:56:18.983 --> 00:56:25.770
we're innocent of any wrongdoing
for not supporting the poor.

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:29.887
This is an appeal for charity.
So, maybe you will donate or

00:56:29.887 --> 00:56:32.920
you probably--some of you have
already done that.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:37.661
I wanted you to--because I
think you're launching out on

00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:41.453
careers and there's
something--there seems to

00:56:41.453 --> 00:56:45.943
be--moral dilemmas abound.
I was impressed just looking at

00:56:45.943 --> 00:56:49.320
the New York Times this
morning--the stories that

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.881
suggested moral dilemmas for
young people who are launching

00:56:52.881 --> 00:56:55.976
out on careers.
One of them--they were

00:56:55.976 --> 00:57:01.066
reporting on the Pennsylvania
primary, which incidentally you

00:57:01.066 --> 00:57:04.289
heard Hillary Clinton won 55 to
45,

00:57:04.289 --> 00:57:07.119
but that's not what I was
referring to.

00:57:07.119 --> 00:57:10.251
It was that they said the
voters thought the most

00:57:10.251 --> 00:57:12.796
important issue is the
economy--the U.S.

00:57:12.796 --> 00:57:16.320
economy--and I was thinking,
well what about Iraq?

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:20.232
And what about all the people
that we are responsible--we've

00:57:20.232 --> 00:57:23.880
created the current situation
there and people are dying

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:27.659
everyday there and we're
concerned about the economy.

00:57:27.659 --> 00:57:30.735
Somehow, it seemed to be
something--next thing on the

00:57:30.735 --> 00:57:33.516
news this morning,
Rupert Murdoch will be buying

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:36.709
Newsday,
the sixth largest regional

00:57:36.709 --> 00:57:40.289
paper in the United States for
$580 million.

00:57:40.289 --> 00:57:43.630
Somehow, there's something
bothersome about that story.

00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:49.860
This guy is super rich;
he's buying all the newspapers.

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:53.332
He's getting--I mean,
he's a finance person and he's

00:57:53.332 --> 00:57:57.418
gaining control over--people
read these newspapers as part of

00:57:57.418 --> 00:58:01.640
their recreation and relaxation
and Newsday is kind of a

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:05.547
fun paper,
but it's under control of this

00:58:05.547 --> 00:58:08.792
finance billionaire.
I don't know if that's a moral

00:58:08.792 --> 00:58:11.019
issue.
Next thing in today's

00:58:11.019 --> 00:58:15.154
paper--the U.S.
has 5% of the world population

00:58:15.154 --> 00:58:20.391
and 25% of its prison inmates,
so something is maybe wrong

00:58:20.391 --> 00:58:23.362
here.
Another thing that was in

00:58:23.362 --> 00:58:28.125
today's paper--South African
dockworkers refuse to unload a

00:58:28.125 --> 00:58:33.052
Chinese ship with weapons bound
for Robert Mugabe's regime in

00:58:33.052 --> 00:58:38.061
Zimbabwe and that the Chinese
ship may return to China without

00:58:38.061 --> 00:58:40.846
delivering.
This may be--well,

00:58:40.846 --> 00:58:45.940
who are the dockworkers?
This is not Rupert Murdoch;

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:49.961
this is humble people loading
the docks and they have a union

00:58:49.961 --> 00:58:52.909
and they said,
we're not going to do this;

00:58:52.909 --> 00:58:56.635
we're not going to support
Mugabe's brutal efforts to

00:58:56.635 --> 00:59:01.022
suppress a free election.
You start to wonder,

00:59:01.022 --> 00:59:08.625
are finance people moral or are
they--I just give some--I think

00:59:08.625 --> 00:59:13.039
that--I don't know how you
think,

00:59:13.039 --> 00:59:16.899
but when I was your age,
I somehow wanted a perfect

00:59:16.899 --> 00:59:20.450
career that was morally right
and important.

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:24.239
So, who has as perfect career?
I don't know.

00:59:24.239 --> 00:59:27.587
I don't have an answer and I'm
not going to propose an answer,

00:59:27.587 --> 00:59:30.659
but let me just consider some
names that come to mind.

00:59:30.659 --> 00:59:34.226
Bill Gates--now,
he is a businessperson who runs

00:59:34.226 --> 00:59:38.856
a tight financial ship and you
may be aware of how tight it is

00:59:38.856 --> 00:59:43.409
when you try to pirate one of
his programs or something.

00:59:43.409 --> 00:59:48.340
So, he has a reputation for
being a tough guy.

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:52.887
On the other hand,
he and Warren Buffett have set

00:59:52.887 --> 00:59:58.382
up the biggest transparently
operated charitable foundation

00:59:58.382 --> 01:00:03.119
in the world and it has $38.7
billion dollars.

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:07.910
How should we view--I wonder
how Peter Unger would view Bill

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:10.093
Gates.
He does have a--what did he

01:00:10.093 --> 01:00:13.650
spend on his house?
$35 million on his house.

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:15.365
[News acconts now put current
assessed value at around $200

01:00:15.365 --> 01:00:16.489
million.]
He does live a high style,

01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:21.900
but should he have started out
giving away 90% of his income

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:25.318
when he was your age?
He wouldn't be making any money

01:00:25.318 --> 01:00:27.260
if he did that,
so I'm just thinking about--I'm

01:00:27.260 --> 01:00:28.780
not saying what's right or
wrong,

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:33.309
but I wanted to give one other
example that comes to mind.

01:00:33.309 --> 01:00:44.480
Have you heard of this guy,
Muhammad Yunus?

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:50.704
He went to Vanderbilt
University and got a PhD in

01:00:50.704 --> 01:00:58.226
Economics in 1969 and then he
became assistant professor of

01:00:58.226 --> 01:01:04.840
economics at Middle Tennessee
State University.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:08.833
It sounds like a very ordinary
career so far--actually,

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:12.309
it's good being a PhD,
but ordinary in a way;

01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:16.900
but then, he did something very
important in 1976.

01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.312
He went back to his home
country, which was

01:01:19.312 --> 01:01:22.530
Bangladesh--one of the poorest
countries in the world.

01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:30.190
He founded a bank called the
Grameen Bank.

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:36.550
Does anyone speak Bengali here?
What does Grameen mean?

01:01:36.550 --> 01:01:41.156
There's no Bengali here.
Well, I'm told it means "of the

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:44.477
village."
What he did was create a bank

01:01:44.477 --> 01:01:49.180
that made loans to poor people;
they're called micro-finance.

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.422
So, the typical loan was made
to a young woman who was in

01:01:58.422 --> 01:02:02.617
desperate poverty and the loan
would be enough to buy some

01:02:02.617 --> 01:02:06.739
small item that would start a
business--for example,

01:02:06.739 --> 01:02:11.607
a push cart that could serve
hot food so she could then go

01:02:11.607 --> 01:02:16.559
and stand on a street corner and
sell some kind of food.

01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:22.070
That can be huge difference,
having the money to buy a food

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:27.010
cart, and can make her able to
support her family.

01:02:27.010 --> 01:02:32.295
No banks before the Grameen
Bank would do that sort of thing

01:02:32.295 --> 01:02:37.223
and they claimed that they
couldn't make money doing it,

01:02:37.223 --> 01:02:42.498
but he apparently succeeded.
So, he won the Nobel--actually,

01:02:42.498 --> 01:02:47.316
the Nobel Peace Prize went both
to Yunus and the Grameen Bank a

01:02:47.316 --> 01:02:51.638
couple years ago.
Those are examples of people

01:02:51.638 --> 01:02:55.000
who had kind of financey
careers.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.283
If you looked at Muhammad Yunus
in earlier years it might not

01:03:00.283 --> 01:03:05.389
look like a very morally,
Peter Unger-type moral career.

01:03:05.389 --> 01:03:10.491
I don't know what Peter Unger
would say about Muhammad Yunus

01:03:10.491 --> 01:03:12.355
now.
He never--we don't ever have

01:03:12.355 --> 01:03:15.046
sense that he gave away 90% of
his income to poor people,

01:03:15.046 --> 01:03:18.599
but look what he did.
So, I don't know the answer.

01:03:18.599 --> 01:03:21.994
I guess what I'm getting at is
that I don't know the answer to

01:03:21.994 --> 01:03:27.062
these moral questions,
but I think that it's kind of a

01:03:27.062 --> 01:03:33.685
mistake to think that a career
in finance is necessarily

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:36.801
immoral.
If you read Peter Unger you get

01:03:36.801 --> 01:03:40.211
the impression that just about
everyone is evading the moral

01:03:40.211 --> 01:03:43.453
issues.
Maybe we're incapable of really

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:48.007
behaving the way logical
consideration of ethics would

01:03:48.007 --> 01:03:53.741
compel us to do.
So, hardly anyone is giving 90%

01:03:53.741 --> 01:03:55.990
of their income.

01:04:02.699 --> 01:04:07.771
I don't know where that leaves
us exactly, but I guess what I

01:04:07.771 --> 01:04:12.505
want to do is leave open the
possibility that a career in

01:04:12.505 --> 01:04:16.647
something related to risk
management can be a very

01:04:16.647 --> 01:04:23.017
meaningful career path for life.
I guess it comes back to the

01:04:23.017 --> 01:04:29.782
feeling that we live in a very
risky world whose benefits are

01:04:29.782 --> 01:04:34.179
at this point shared very
unequally.

01:04:34.179 --> 01:04:39.577
I think that it's not--the
simple idea that you should be

01:04:39.577 --> 01:04:45.650
writing checks to UNICEF is not
necessarily the final answer,

01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:51.159
but what you should be doing
with your life.

01:04:51.159 --> 01:04:55.325
Somehow, what we see in these
examples--I gave both of Bill

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:59.274
Gates and Muhammad Yunus--and
I'm not setting them up as

01:04:59.274 --> 01:05:04.918
necessarily examples,
but it's that a career that

01:05:04.918 --> 01:05:13.185
develops some idea that's well
motivated can be a source of

01:05:13.185 --> 01:05:18.460
great meaning and purpose in
life.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.247
What these people do is,
it seems to me,

01:05:21.247 --> 01:05:25.250
is they develop a career with
some ultimate objective and

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:29.252
somewhere along the career it
may seem that they're doing

01:05:29.252 --> 01:05:32.039
something unimportant or
selfish,

01:05:32.039 --> 01:05:37.130
but you have to judge it in the
big context.

01:05:37.130 --> 01:05:41.400
At times, I felt annoyed with
Bill Gates when I had to pay

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.820
for--when I bought my second
laptop and I had to buy Windows

01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:50.166
again,
but I think that what we really

01:05:50.166 --> 01:05:56.315
have to do is try to think of
how--I guess one's moral

01:05:56.315 --> 01:06:03.161
imperative might be--one view is
it might be that you should

01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:09.542
develop some kind of human
capital and some kind of long

01:06:09.542 --> 01:06:17.199
run plan for how you are going
to apply your human capital.

01:06:17.199 --> 01:06:25.203
It doesn't necessarily mean
satisfying the demands of UNICEF

01:06:25.203 --> 01:06:30.179
along with way.
We are a people and we have a

01:06:30.179 --> 01:06:34.449
certain psychology.
I think we can get above our

01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:39.307
psychology to some extent and
get above the drives of our

01:06:39.307 --> 01:06:43.385
psychology in moments of
inspiration and I think

01:06:43.385 --> 01:06:47.289
developing a career can be part
of that.

01:06:47.289 --> 01:06:54.446
Anyway, I've--that was my
inspirational conclusion to

01:06:54.446 --> 01:06:57.946
this.
So, I don't know what careers

01:06:57.946 --> 01:07:01.181
you will go into,
but in the meantime,

01:07:01.181 --> 01:07:07.578
we do have two more lectures.
I doubt that Larry Summers will

01:07:07.578 --> 01:07:14.543
be giving you advice about your
careers, so I hope to see you

01:07:14.543 --> 01:07:20.000
again on Tuesday and Wednesday
of next week.

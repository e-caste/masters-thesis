00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.585
Prof: Did I tell you the
story when one of my friends was

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:07.070
offered--to buy from me?
 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.705
I was in upper Egypt and I was
traveling with a young lady,

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:14.662
and a third woman,
a little bit older,

00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:18.310
sort of was traveling alone;
it's not terribly comfortable.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.963
She asked to join us I and said
'that's fine,' so the three of

00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:25.710
us were sitting there near
Aswan,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.470
and there were two men sitting
sort of across the room.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.450
One of them dressed in clearly
Arab garb,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.830
and one dressed in a rather
modern suit,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.840
and at some point the guy in
the suit came over,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.141
introduced himself very
politely, and he was a

00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:48.470
Palestinian and the other man
was a Saudi Arabian sheik,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:55.241
and they had noticed that I had
two wives and so the sheik had

00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:58.196
wanted to know--
would like to purchase the

00:00:58.196 --> 00:01:00.759
second--the older one,
the second wife from me.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.798
Since it was the somewhat older
one, he thought I wouldn't mind

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.578
very much.
 

00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:08.269
It was a wonderful scene
because, as you know,

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.540
Palestinians are very
sophisticated;

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.161
they've been living with Jews,
who are basically Europeans,

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.720
for a very long time so they're
just like anybody else.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.530
The Saudi Arabian sheik was
obviously living,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.813
not in the modern world and
this poor Palestinian had to

00:01:25.813 --> 00:01:28.351
intermediate,
so he was very scared how I

00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:29.230
would respond.
 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.286
Would I make a scene,
would I slug him,

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:34.208
would I try to get him
arrested, or any of this sort of

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:34.750
stuff?
 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.285
Of course it was immediately
obvious to me what was going on

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:41.819
and to my two lady friends and
so we played it very cool and

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:43.848
we,
you know--please sit down,

00:01:43.848 --> 00:01:47.057
let's discuss this,
how old is the sheik,

00:01:47.057 --> 00:01:50.599
how many wives does he already
have,

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.714
how many has he divorced,
does he have any concubines in

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:56.494
addition to his wives,
how much money do you have,

00:01:56.494 --> 00:01:57.050
etc., etc.
 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.132
We had a very,
very nice polite thing and you

00:02:00.132 --> 00:02:04.546
could just see the intermediary
his face just relaxed because he

00:02:04.546 --> 00:02:07.140
was expecting something
terrible.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.979
Everybody played along and it
went off very well,

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.798
and in the middle of this the
sheik calls the intermediary

00:02:15.798 --> 00:02:19.921
over back to him,
and they talk something and out

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:23.952
comes a velvet purse given to
the Palestinian and he gives it

00:02:23.952 --> 00:02:28.050
to me as a sign of good faith on
the part of the Arabian,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.520
he wanted me to have this.
 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.288
What is it?
 

00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:34.099
A set of Muslim prayer beads,
beautiful cat's-eye stones,

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.910
many--not just a chain but
beautiful, beautiful handiwork

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.020
and probably very valuable.
 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.998
I was looking for--to bring to
class--actually last time and I

00:02:42.998 --> 00:02:44.270
can't find it right now.
 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.634
Everything worked out,
the women paid very great

00:02:47.634 --> 00:02:51.675
attention to what was going on,
and we said politely at the end

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:54.628
that we would consider and give
them an answer tomorrow.

00:02:54.628 --> 00:02:59.520
In the end she didn't want to
be bought, even though she's

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.581
obviously going to have some
good chunk of change out of it,

00:03:04.581 --> 00:03:06.468
or at least I was.
 

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:14.139
Two things will have to be
delayed because Eliezeri is not

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:19.792
here and we have to add
something to Noah's

00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:22.080
presentation.
 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.628
Let's skip that.
 

00:03:27.628 --> 00:03:32.377
Last time we were discussing
Europe and we were coming into

00:03:32.377 --> 00:03:34.256
the--
we started to discuss the

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:37.390
Middle Ages and we start with
Europe because we have the best

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.810
data.
 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.566
We have very,
very good data about lots and

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:40.780
lots of things from Europe.
 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.639
It's not so good from the rest
of the world.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.883
From about--for about 500
years, from 1200 to 1700 the

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:54.206
data, poor as the data is,
shows that population really

00:03:54.206 --> 00:03:56.610
didn't rise terribly much.
 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.639
They were in some sort of
stasis.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.310
The reasons for this we had
discussed a little bit.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.421
We talked about the plague,
and the plague lasted like 500

00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:17.559
years--
this is--remember the plague

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:32.024
hit Europe in 1347 so this table
where they have good data starts

00:04:32.024 --> 00:04:36.319
200 years later.
 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.341
The plague has been around for
200 years and still there's a

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:42.913
number of cases;
that's not individuals but

00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:46.067
different cities and places in
which there was an outbreak and

00:04:46.067 --> 00:04:49.170
we just don't have good records
of how many people died,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.021
but 1550,1600,
1650, see the plague is dying

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:57.639
out slowly and there's many,
many theories whether people

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.956
got resistance to it,
or the rats that carried it,

00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:04.439
died or were out-competed by
another species of rats.

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:08.259
Not known, but the plague did
eventually die out.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:14.759
From 1347 to 1849,
is 500 years where the plague

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.250
keeps recurring.
 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.353
That was clearly one of the
reasons why population couldn't

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:21.850
grow.
 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.310
Then there was violence,
there was constant small level

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.764
violence,
and then when the Protestant

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:32.216
Reformation happened,
the religious wars broke out

00:05:32.216 --> 00:05:38.459
and according to one of the
standard textbooks of European

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:43.060
history they ran from 1531 up to
1657,

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.877
so another 130 years of
slaughter and they rolled around

00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:48.889
different places in Europe.
 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.839
By the time they were done the
most contested--

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:56.093
southern Europe stayed
Catholic, and very northern

00:05:56.093 --> 00:06:00.144
Europe became Protestant but the
middle of Europe was strongly

00:06:00.144 --> 00:06:02.995
contested--
and so something like a third

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:06.581
to a half of everybody got
killed in this time because of

00:06:06.581 --> 00:06:07.990
the religious wars.
 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.367
This is the period that Malthus
is describing and we'll come

00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:15.560
back to Malthus--that Malthus
knew about.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.980
This is the history that he
understood and we'll come back

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.862
to what his theories were,
but the historians now agree

00:06:22.862 --> 00:06:26.230
pretty much that productivity of
the land,

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.086
especially agriculture,
because that was the main

00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:31.942
occupation,
was rising very slowly during

00:06:31.942 --> 00:06:34.598
this period,
but population is also rising

00:06:34.598 --> 00:06:38.740
very slowly during this period,
so pretty much the gains in

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.204
agricultural productivity were
balanced by the gains in

00:06:43.204 --> 00:06:47.502
population and the average
standard of living did not

00:06:47.502 --> 00:06:52.050
improve and we'll talk a good
bit more about that.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.992
Now why--so the question I mean
is pretty obvious why they were

00:06:55.992 --> 00:06:59.110
not able to improve agricultural
productivity,

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.057
why they were not able to
significantly improve any other

00:07:02.057 --> 00:07:04.060
kind of manufacturing
productivity,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.761
why they were not able to do
anything to fight these

00:07:07.761 --> 00:07:08.560
diseases.
 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.218
It comes down to,
that not only was there no

00:07:11.218 --> 00:07:14.620
scientific knowledge as we
currently understand the word

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.033
scientific,
there really wasn't any

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:23.577
particular interest in--
intellectually in the real

00:07:23.577 --> 00:07:24.360
world.
 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.829
Everything was focused on
religion and the other world,

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:33.670
so there was not a lot of
intellectual energy expended in

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.783
trying to understand what was
going on around your feet so to

00:07:37.783 --> 00:07:38.470
speak.
 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.507
Because they had all kinds of
problems that we take for

00:07:42.507 --> 00:07:44.932
granted,
all kinds of ways of dealing

00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:47.279
with the real world just were
not even--

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:50.440
were not really thought about
in any serious way.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.942
Sanitation, up until the
eighteenth century,

00:07:53.942 --> 00:07:58.504
up until the 1800s actually,
the sanitation in Europe was

00:07:58.504 --> 00:08:00.949
just absolutely atrocious.
 

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:05.259
There was no system for
disposing of human waste.

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:07.994
Nobody bothered to pay
attention to what to do with

00:08:07.994 --> 00:08:08.759
human waste.
 

00:08:08.759 --> 00:08:10.410
Feces were basically everywhere.
 

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:14.660
Wherever you went there was
someone else's feces.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.829
In the eighteenth century the
city streets everywhere had

00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:23.074
ditches down the middle of the
street and that's where the

00:08:23.074 --> 00:08:24.639
feces got dumped.
 

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:27.399
There were buckets inside the
house and some servant,

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:30.583
or the housewife would take the
bucket and dump it into these

00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:31.220
ditches.
 

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.573
They were also used as
latrines, people would just go

00:08:34.573 --> 00:08:38.379
out there and if they didn't
have a bucket in the house,

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:40.850
or if they didn't have a house,
go in and do it in the latrine.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.580
Again, in each case--I was in
Belize City in Latin--

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.328
in Central America as you know,
not that many years ago in the

00:08:50.328 --> 00:08:53.279
middle of the street there's one
big latrine,

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.639
and the stink was just
incredible.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:59.754
Now you didn't actually have
to--were not required to

00:08:59.754 --> 00:09:04.029
actually take your bucket of
feces and dump them in the

00:09:04.029 --> 00:09:06.437
street,
you could throw them out your

00:09:06.437 --> 00:09:06.840
window.
 

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.821
But eventually people did start
thinking about that,

00:09:10.821 --> 00:09:14.960
and the issue was not to dump
it on someone's head.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:20.289
In Edinburgh,
Scotland they rang bells at

00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:21.889
10:00 p.m.
 

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:25.181
at night when they figured
people should be off the street

00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:28.703
and that was the specified time
for dumping excrement out your

00:09:28.703 --> 00:09:29.340
window.
 

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.428
Some of the older of you that
were properly brought up--

00:09:31.428 --> 00:09:35.428
the young men were maybe told
that you should walk on the

00:09:35.428 --> 00:09:38.929
street side when you're
escorting a young lady.

00:09:38.929 --> 00:09:40.840
Do you know what that's for?
 

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:44.706
When stuff gets dumped out the
window it's to prevent splash

00:09:44.706 --> 00:09:47.573
from cars,
it's way earlier then cars,

00:09:47.573 --> 00:09:50.587
it was to--
so that when someone dumped

00:09:50.587 --> 00:09:56.460
stuff out the window it would--
the lady would be under some

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.220
kind of awnings there.
 

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.389
It wasn't only the common
people, the poor,

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:06.009
the uneducated that were living
in such filth,

00:10:06.009 --> 00:10:10.000
it went right up to the royalty
and we have records of this.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.038
In 1665, there was a great
plague in London,

00:10:13.038 --> 00:10:16.644
one of those that I've showed
you there and that's the one

00:10:16.644 --> 00:10:20.211
that--
written about by Robinson

00:10:20.211 --> 00:10:23.820
Crusoe author,
Daniel Dafoe.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.244
The King, Charles II,
and his court took his refuge

00:10:27.244 --> 00:10:28.820
in Oxford University.
 

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.506
Now Yale is modeled after--a
lot of Yale is modeled after

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:36.259
Oxford, so you have a good image
of what it looks like.

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:39.029
The plague was over,
it took about a year,

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:41.572
the plague was over,
they went back to London and

00:10:41.572 --> 00:10:43.798
just left whatever they left in
Oxford,

00:10:43.798 --> 00:10:46.970
and the cleaning people came in
and what did they find?

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.072
Excrement everywhere,
they described it excrement in

00:10:50.072 --> 00:10:51.592
every corner,
in chimneys,

00:10:51.592 --> 00:10:55.000
in studies, in coal houses,
in cellars, just all over the

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.730
place.
 

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.298
Now some of this information
comes from the diary of Samuel

00:11:00.298 --> 00:11:00.928
Pepys.
 

00:11:00.928 --> 00:11:03.129
How many of you are aware of
this?

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:06.837
Some of you again if you've
taken history or literature,

00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:09.399
he was the famous diarist from
that.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:12.038
He was England's first
Secretary of the Admiralty,

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:14.833
a Member of Parliament,
President of The Royal

00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:18.034
Scientific Society,
so he was not your ordinary

00:11:18.034 --> 00:11:18.918
average guy.
 

00:11:18.918 --> 00:11:22.589
He was educated,
had money and in the upper

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:24.815
classes,
but he writes that -- when he

00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.778
had to defecate in the middle of
the night--

00:11:26.778 --> 00:11:28.759
he didn't bother to go to the
privy,

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:35.450
he just deposited his feces in
the fireplace.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.070
You can see that it was a
smelly place to live in.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:45.099
Now along with no concern or no
thought about where you deposit

00:11:45.099 --> 00:11:48.956
your excrement,
the idea of keeping drinking

00:11:48.956 --> 00:11:53.018
water separate from this
excrement was not in anybody's

00:11:53.018 --> 00:11:53.620
mind.
 

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:58.139
That very often if there were
public holes or someplace where

00:11:58.139 --> 00:12:01.230
the public could go to do their
thing,

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.110
then maybe right next to it was
a drinking fountain.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:10.572
In terms of the waste in the
streets, it wasn't just feces

00:12:10.572 --> 00:12:16.808
but everything else was just
dumped into the streets.

00:12:16.808 --> 00:12:21.695
England especially had lots of
animals, Europe had animals,

00:12:21.695 --> 00:12:25.063
unlike China,
and when animals died--just

00:12:25.063 --> 00:12:28.769
left in the middle of the street
to rot.

00:12:28.769 --> 00:12:30.808
Butchers that pulled out the
entrails,

00:12:30.808 --> 00:12:32.720
the guts of the animals and
inedible parts,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.807
dump it in the street and so
the streets are just full of not

00:12:36.807 --> 00:12:40.690
only human excrement but the
waste of all the animals,

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.370
and of course the flies and
insects lay their eggs in it and

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.100
grow,
and it's very unsanitary.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:54.259
Dead people were not handled
any better than this.

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:57.692
As more people died,
the urban cemeteries got filled

00:12:57.692 --> 00:12:58.029
up.
 

00:12:58.029 --> 00:13:02.995
There was not so much space and
so they stopped burying the poor

00:13:02.995 --> 00:13:06.245
people in--
properly in cemeteries but just

00:13:06.245 --> 00:13:10.408
what they call 'poor holes,'
just large pits in which piles

00:13:10.408 --> 00:13:13.710
of bodies were just laid out
side by side,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.500
row by row, and row on top of
row and they were not closed

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.028
until they were full.
 

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:23.232
You had these pits of rotting
bodies just festering there in

00:13:23.232 --> 00:13:27.649
the middle of all the cities
that had enough people to bury.

00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:32.205
Of course the stench was just
overwhelming and the rich people

00:13:32.205 --> 00:13:35.940
were not buried in these pits
but if they were--

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.649
they could be buried in
cemeteries,

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:40.515
but if they were really
important they bought space in

00:13:40.515 --> 00:13:43.490
the church crypt or they
contributed money and got space

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.788
in the church crypt.
 

00:13:44.788 --> 00:13:49.261
Many of you have undoubtedly
gone to churches and in the

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:53.898
basement they've got these
crypts of dead people and guess

00:13:53.898 --> 00:13:54.629
what?
 

00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:59.850
They were rotting and stank,
so the churches stank.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.408
One quote is that 'they stank
out parson and

00:14:03.408 --> 00:14:08.460
congregation'--that people just
couldn't stand to be there.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:13.183
In 1742, Dr. Johnson,
who you know wrote The Life of

00:14:13.183 --> 00:14:16.796
Boswell--excuse me,
Boswell's Life of

00:14:16.796 --> 00:14:20.778
Johnson, so he's quoting
Johnson.

00:14:20.778 --> 00:14:28.176
Described London as a city,
"Which abounds with such

00:14:28.176 --> 00:14:36.629
heaps of filth as a savage would
look on with amazement."

00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:40.722
The death rate--cities were so
unhealthy from all this filth

00:14:40.722 --> 00:14:44.538
that the death rates were
enormously high and cities did

00:14:44.538 --> 00:14:46.620
not keep themselves going.
 

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.552
If left to itself a city's
population would just disappear

00:14:49.552 --> 00:14:52.330
and some estimates are that
about every generation,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.830
about a third of the
inhabitants of a city would die.

00:14:56.830 --> 00:14:59.710
I mean everybody died,
but the population left--

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.721
the city just left to itself
would go down by a third in

00:15:03.721 --> 00:15:06.633
every generation,
and the only reason that cities

00:15:06.633 --> 00:15:09.447
were able to prosper was that in
the countryside where things

00:15:09.447 --> 00:15:11.370
were healthier just because of
space,

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.368
there wasn't the demography,
there wasn't the crowding of

00:15:15.368 --> 00:15:18.509
people that constantly the
excess births,

00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:21.942
the excess population from the
countryside would keep migrating

00:15:21.942 --> 00:15:25.097
into the cities because they had
primogeniture in England,

00:15:25.097 --> 00:15:26.038
for instance.
 

00:15:26.038 --> 00:15:28.807
Only the oldest son could
inherit the land,

00:15:28.807 --> 00:15:32.892
so younger sons had to migrate
into the cities or into the army

00:15:32.892 --> 00:15:35.658
and that's what kept the cities
going.

00:15:35.658 --> 00:15:42.011
There's a constant stream of
people coming in from the

00:15:42.011 --> 00:15:43.690
countryside.
 

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.548
Now it's not only London and
the great cities,

00:15:45.548 --> 00:15:47.658
and it's not only that part of
Europe,

00:15:47.658 --> 00:15:51.090
but we have descriptions of
some of the other cities,

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.460
and one of them is currently
politically very relevant.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.934
It is Jerusalem and now all the
great Western religions claim

00:15:58.934 --> 00:16:03.335
that Jerusalem is central to
their religion and they compete

00:16:03.335 --> 00:16:06.260
viciously;
they fight viciously over

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.090
Jerusalem.
 

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.370
They all claim that they've
been interested forever in this,

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.371
but in fact,
… until Napoleon's

00:16:14.371 --> 00:16:17.778
expedition to Egypt in the
Middle East,

00:16:17.778 --> 00:16:21.596
it was totally ignored as a
physical thing from the crusades

00:16:21.596 --> 00:16:23.990
to Napoleon it was totally
ignored.

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.039
In 1840 it was a tiny town of
15,000 people;

00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:30.629
7,000 Jews;
5,000 Muslims;

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:33.320
3,000 Christians from the
records that we have.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.410
In a place like that,
presumably the seed of the

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.827
Western religions,
the feces were 50 feet deep and

00:16:41.827 --> 00:16:46.919
had been collecting since the
destruction of the second temple

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:48.340
by the Romans.
 

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.549
Before the Romans destroyed
Jerusalem there was some sort of

00:16:53.549 --> 00:16:57.878
sanitation going on,
but between then and 1840 the

00:16:57.878 --> 00:17:00.440
feces just kept going up.
 

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.970
Of course in this filth
everybody was sick.

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.430
Basically everyone had malaria,
and malaria was endemic there.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.000
When cholera came through,
which it came periodically,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.998
75% of the people would die of
it and one quote describing

00:17:13.998 --> 00:17:17.288
this,
"The sanitary condition of

00:17:17.288 --> 00:17:22.465
the city of God insure that any
pilgrim who sought to spend his

00:17:22.465 --> 00:17:27.559
last days on earth there could
look forward to fulfilling that

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:30.650
ideal with great dispatch."
 

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.220
Personal cleanliness:
this was also unknown.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.866
We have one professor of
medieval history who gives a

00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:40.795
great lecture and if he ever
gives it as a public lecture

00:17:40.795 --> 00:17:42.759
that I've seen him give.
 

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:44.868
If he ever gives it again
absolutely go.

00:17:44.868 --> 00:17:49.105
It's called '1,000 Years
Without a Bath,' so this is in

00:17:49.105 --> 00:17:52.265
Europe,
the Romans were very careful

00:17:52.265 --> 00:17:57.016
about personal cleanliness and
they built these great big

00:17:57.016 --> 00:17:57.779
baths.
 

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:02.779
… Have you visited the
baths of Caracalla in Rome;

00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:03.598
a couple of you have.
 

00:18:03.598 --> 00:18:07.362
How about Bath--the city in
England named after its baths

00:18:07.362 --> 00:18:08.368
and so forth?
 

00:18:08.368 --> 00:18:12.709
All these are Roman creations,
so the Romans very careful,

00:18:12.709 --> 00:18:16.895
as much as they could in a
place like that with personal

00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:17.808
hygiene.
 

00:18:17.808 --> 00:18:20.630
But after the fall of Rome the
morality changes,

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.407
the church takes over,
and the church wants people to

00:18:23.407 --> 00:18:26.078
concentrate on their souls not
on their bodies,

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:30.309
and washing was considered too
much of a sign of preoccupation

00:18:30.309 --> 00:18:33.838
with the body,
and especially for women.

00:18:33.838 --> 00:18:41.913
It's not good for women to pay
too much attention to their

00:18:41.913 --> 00:18:43.190
bodies.
 

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.916
Europeans at that time,
boasted and you've probably

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:49.190
heard this that they only wash
three times in their lives.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.808
How many of you have ever heard
that?

00:18:50.808 --> 00:18:52.858
Once when they're born,
once when they get married,

00:18:52.858 --> 00:18:55.640
and once when they die they get
washed,

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.867
and the rest of that--not only
didn't they wash they thought

00:18:58.867 --> 00:19:01.660
that water that you washed with
carried disease,

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:06.115
contagion, various theories and
that if you washed you would

00:19:06.115 --> 00:19:08.910
probably get sick from the
washing.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.694
The solution was not
cleanliness--the solution to the

00:19:11.694 --> 00:19:13.460
bad conditions--
but perfume,

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.460
and perfume comes up in this
era because people stank so much

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.221
that,
if they had the money,

00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:22.579
they would buy perfume.
 

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.618
Anybody know why--yes?
 

00:19:25.618 --> 00:19:30.684
Student:  Was the water
likely to make you sick because

00:19:30.684 --> 00:19:32.180
it was so dirty?
 

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.520
Prof: Good question,
was the water likely to make

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.250
them sick?
 

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.630
If they drank the water, yes.
 

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.650
If they washed in the water, no.
 

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.529
There's very little in
temperate zone water that's

00:19:43.529 --> 00:19:45.470
going to get through your skin.
 

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:48.740
In tropical zones there can be
parasites in there and they can

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.587
be dangerous,
but in Europe I'm not sort of

00:19:52.587 --> 00:19:59.078
aware of anything that washing
in the water will get you sick.

00:19:59.078 --> 00:20:02.392
Student:  On the hand if
you wash yourself and it stays

00:20:02.392 --> 00:20:05.651
on your skin and then you eat or
something could you then get

00:20:05.651 --> 00:20:06.140
sick?
 

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:08.596
Prof: Yes,
if you wash yourself,

00:20:08.596 --> 00:20:12.218
it stays on your skin and then
you eat with your unwashed

00:20:12.218 --> 00:20:14.417
hands--
well probably what was on there

00:20:14.417 --> 00:20:16.338
before you washed is going to be
worse.

00:20:16.338 --> 00:20:20.057
In general, I think nobody
washed unless something comes

00:20:20.057 --> 00:20:23.710
off--the burden of whatever's on
the skin gets less.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.278
All of these things are what we
modern people think about,

00:20:27.278 --> 00:20:30.305
but obviously,
back then, just these kind of

00:20:30.305 --> 00:20:33.963
very simple straightforward
questions were not really

00:20:33.963 --> 00:20:35.019
considered.
 

00:20:35.019 --> 00:20:37.078
People back then,
George Washington,

00:20:37.078 --> 00:20:39.548
King George wore wigs--anybody
know why?

00:20:39.548 --> 00:20:44.435
Some of you probably know why
they wear wigs--underneath the

00:20:44.435 --> 00:20:49.068
wig was--
Student:  Head lice.

00:20:49.068 --> 00:20:51.167
Prof: Lots of lice,
shaved heads,

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.029
they had lice.
 

00:20:52.029 --> 00:20:54.327
Lice was endemic,
they couldn't get rid of it,

00:20:54.327 --> 00:20:55.808
so they shaved their heads.
 

00:20:55.808 --> 00:20:58.651
I think we just saw that on
television with the John Adams

00:20:58.651 --> 00:20:59.048
story.
 

00:20:59.048 --> 00:21:02.740
Every so often--did any of you
see that TV show?

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:09.801
HBO--anyway he takes off his
wig and there he is bald,

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:13.400
that was to prevent lice.
 

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:19.336
One of the reasons--one of the
major reasons for this lack of

00:21:19.336 --> 00:21:24.578
population growth for hundreds
of years in Europe,

00:21:24.578 --> 00:21:27.569
just no idea about sanitation,
hygiene,

00:21:27.569 --> 00:21:30.308
any of this kind of stuff.
 

00:21:30.308 --> 00:21:36.048
Another aspect which you'll be
reading about is infanticide.

00:21:36.048 --> 00:21:39.800
Infanticide was a very large
factor in European demography

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.027
and the rest of the world,
as you will read about,

00:21:43.027 --> 00:21:45.660
but in Europe it was very
important.

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:52.440
There was always a level of
infanticide and--

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.789
of various sorts but in the
eighteenth and nineteenth

00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:58.108
centuries it apparently
exploded--

00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:01.259
the number of kids that were
done away with.

00:22:01.259 --> 00:22:07.267
In Milan, from 1840s to 1860s,
one third of all children born

00:22:07.267 --> 00:22:10.595
to married parents--
we're not talking about

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:14.025
unmarried situations--
were left at foundling homes

00:22:14.025 --> 00:22:18.390
and in foundling homes the death
rate was near 100%.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.585
More than half of all the
children born to working class

00:22:21.585 --> 00:22:23.910
parents were left in foundling
homes,

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.976
and almost all the illegitimate
children were abandoned and the

00:22:27.976 --> 00:22:30.575
death rates--
it was a form of infanticide,

00:22:30.575 --> 00:22:32.858
you just gave them to a
foundling home,

00:22:32.858 --> 00:22:35.321
they were taken,
basically, no care of,

00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:36.099
they died.
 

00:22:36.099 --> 00:22:38.848
It was out of sight.
 

00:22:38.848 --> 00:22:42.291
Again, not just the ordinary
ignorant person but you all know

00:22:42.291 --> 00:22:43.670
Jean-Jacques Rousseau?
 

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.173
The famous French
philosophe who wrote a

00:22:47.173 --> 00:22:50.680
lot that encouraged the American
Revolution.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.785
This is a quote from him,
"My third child was thus

00:22:54.785 --> 00:22:59.118
deposited in a foundling home
just like the first two,

00:22:59.118 --> 00:23:01.690
and I did the same with the two
following.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.028
I had five in all.
 

00:23:04.028 --> 00:23:05.890
The arrangement seemed to me so
good,

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.422
so sensible,
so appropriate that,

00:23:08.422 --> 00:23:11.348
if I did not boast of it
publicly,

00:23:11.348 --> 00:23:14.650
it was solely out of regard for
their mother."

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:19.734
There was no--here they're
abandoning these children to

00:23:19.734 --> 00:23:24.538
almost certain death and
it--there was just no moral

00:23:24.538 --> 00:23:27.930
compunction about it whatsoever.
 

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.368
Aside from absolute abandonment
to foundling homes or …

00:23:31.368 --> 00:23:33.400
just leaving them in the
streets--

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.588
you'll read about American and
England where the kids were just

00:23:36.588 --> 00:23:38.029
often left in the streets.
 

00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:43.486
Another mechanism was sending
out children to nurse with wet

00:23:43.486 --> 00:23:49.126
nurses and the death rate of wet
nurse children was enormously

00:23:49.126 --> 00:23:49.960
high.
 

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:53.627
So, if parents tried to rear
their children,

00:23:53.627 --> 00:23:57.980
the death rate was about one in
six at this time.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:04.800
In eighteenth century France
between a half and two-thirds of

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:09.690
infants that were sent out to
nurse died.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.078
Even at a higher death rate
were the so called baby farms,

00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:17.230
in the nineteenth century
Europe there were--

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.068
it's like we call them puppy
mills now,

00:24:19.068 --> 00:24:22.636
they were baby farms,
and they took in vast numbers

00:24:22.636 --> 00:24:25.420
of children presumably to wet
nurse,

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.730
but almost none of them
survived.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.336
As I showed you from these and
all kinds of reasons,

00:24:33.336 --> 00:24:37.308
about a third of children died
in infancy.

00:24:37.308 --> 00:24:42.179
The idea of being a parent and
the family idea of childrearing

00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:46.170
was completely different then we
now understand.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.112
The standard thing was a child
was born, it was almost

00:24:49.112 --> 00:24:52.386
immediately sent out to wet
nurse, someone that doesn't care

00:24:52.386 --> 00:24:53.220
about them.
 

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.711
A lot was written about wet
nurses getting drunk,

00:24:55.711 --> 00:24:57.631
having the baby in bed,
getting drunk,

00:24:57.631 --> 00:25:00.328
rolling over on the baby and
squashing the baby.

00:25:00.328 --> 00:25:04.946
Whether that was an excuse or
the real reason for the child's

00:25:04.946 --> 00:25:06.410
death is unknown.
 

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.642
They would wet nurse for a
couple of years and then those

00:25:10.642 --> 00:25:14.118
that were still alive would come
back home,

00:25:14.118 --> 00:25:19.140
maybe age two or three or
something,

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.760
and then by age seven they
would be sent back out to work

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.650
again as an apprentice
somewhere.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.535
How many have read Charles
Dickens: David

00:25:29.535 --> 00:25:32.420
Copperfield,
and Oliver Twist?

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.640
What age were they sent out to
work?

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.071
Seven.
 

00:25:35.071 --> 00:25:39.104
Seven is the standard age,
there are scenes of one of the

00:25:39.104 --> 00:25:43.065
Dicken's characters going to
work in a dye factory dying

00:25:43.065 --> 00:25:46.506
cloth,
and he comes out black every

00:25:46.506 --> 00:25:48.990
day, covered with the dye.
 

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.480
That was quite a standard thing.
 

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.406
In 1646, the rich and very
progressive town of Leyden in

00:25:57.406 --> 00:26:00.852
the Netherlands,
Lehyden was one of the most

00:26:00.852 --> 00:26:05.133
advanced places in Europe,
limited the working day for

00:26:05.133 --> 00:26:08.169
children to 14 hours,
whether the law was obeyed or

00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:11.720
not we don't know,
but children could not do that.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.320
Of course Charles Dickens is a
couple of hundred years later in

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.368
the nineteenth century.
 

00:26:15.368 --> 00:26:19.909
Apparently, in every one of his
novels, there's some scene of

00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:21.650
child labor going on.
 

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:26.035
Now I'm talking about up to the
1800s but this does not

00:26:26.035 --> 00:26:27.009
disappear.
 

00:26:27.009 --> 00:26:29.999
Now you look what Europe--the
situation Europe was in,

00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:33.440
in 1800--some of the developing
countries are currently in.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.256
So official figures from India,
the government figures,

00:26:37.256 --> 00:26:40.788
say there are 12 million child
workers in India.

00:26:40.788 --> 00:26:45.247
Opponents, activists on the
labor issue, estimate that it's

00:26:45.247 --> 00:26:49.318
closer to 60 million children in
India are working.

00:26:49.318 --> 00:26:54.923
They do have child labor laws
now in India and they prohibit

00:26:54.923 --> 00:27:00.150
children under age 14 from
working in hazardous jobs.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.146
When the scandal about Gap,
our clothing manufacture Gap

00:27:04.146 --> 00:27:07.365
came out,
the factories that were

00:27:07.365 --> 00:27:13.284
investigated had children as
young as ten years old working

00:27:13.284 --> 00:27:18.282
up to 16 hours a day making the
dungarees …

00:27:18.282 --> 00:27:20.118
that we wear.
 

00:27:20.118 --> 00:27:25.228
All of this sort of misery
leads not only to physical

00:27:25.228 --> 00:27:29.650
misery but change in attitude
toward life,

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:34.410
and death came very easily,
it was very common and so life

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.578
was cheaper.
 

00:27:35.578 --> 00:27:39.625
There's no question about it
from the literature that life

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:42.108
was cheaper then we consider
now.

00:27:42.108 --> 00:27:45.288
Because children especially
were so likely to die,

00:27:45.288 --> 00:27:48.640
as well as anyone else,
it was considered imprudent,

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.030
not wise, to be particularly
affectionate with or emotionally

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.180
entwined with any other human
being.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.627
Your husband might die
immediately, your kids might

00:27:57.627 --> 00:27:59.490
die, your wife might die.
 

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.730
And so as far as we can tell
from the writings of the period,

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.958
what we call affective
relationships,

00:28:04.958 --> 00:28:08.608
emotional relationships were
rather cool in this period,

00:28:08.608 --> 00:28:14.480
except of course violent anger
which always pops out.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.426
Going back to this,
here's all these problems,

00:28:20.426 --> 00:28:27.299
and what did people do about
some of these things?

00:28:38.279 --> 00:28:42.794
An idea of disease comes from
the Greeks and probably farther

00:28:42.794 --> 00:28:47.327
back then the Greeks,
that the body is controlled by

00:28:47.327 --> 00:28:50.829
four humors,
fluids that run around the

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:55.118
body, something like the Chi of
Oriental thought.

00:28:55.118 --> 00:28:58.460
And these four humorous must be
in balance.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.171
When you got sick the problem
was that the humors got out of

00:29:02.171 --> 00:29:02.798
balance.
 

00:29:02.798 --> 00:29:07.029
One of the things you did was
get bled.

00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:12.565
That was a standard procedure;
let the blood flow because that

00:29:12.565 --> 00:29:16.068
gets rid of the evil humors.
 

00:29:16.068 --> 00:29:18.917
George Washington was
apparently killed by an excess

00:29:18.917 --> 00:29:22.381
of bloodletting,
so when he was older he got

00:29:22.381 --> 00:29:26.650
quite sick and the doctors--
while he was sick,

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.720
bled five pints of blood out of
him and then he died.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:34.701
We take--when we go to take
blood they take one pint and

00:29:34.701 --> 00:29:37.900
they consider that sort of the
maximum safe amount for young

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:38.930
healthy people.
 

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:42.328
Here he was old and sick,
five pints, he dies.

00:29:42.328 --> 00:29:48.253
His nemesis--George Washington
in America and King George III

00:29:48.253 --> 00:29:53.288
in England--you know the saying,
mad King George?

00:29:53.288 --> 00:29:58.835
He was mad and he was mad with
a genetic disease called

00:29:58.835 --> 00:30:04.380
porphyria which affects the
hemoglobin in the blood.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.200
It caused episodic madness,
so he would be sane,

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.548
then he would be would mad,
then he would be sane,

00:30:08.548 --> 00:30:11.779
then he would be mad,
and when he was mad what did

00:30:11.779 --> 00:30:12.440
they do?
 

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.880
They bled him;
they bled him enormously.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.182
They tied him to a chair,
they did all kinds of things to

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:17.430
him.
 

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:22.941
They had no clue either how to
handle any of these diseases nor

00:30:22.941 --> 00:30:26.084
of a humane way,
no idea of a humane way to

00:30:26.084 --> 00:30:29.607
treat someone who has something
wrong with them that you have no

00:30:29.607 --> 00:30:32.068
clue what it is or what to do
about this.

00:30:32.068 --> 00:30:34.769
If you ever want to see that,
there's a great movie,

00:30:34.769 --> 00:30:37.501
The Madness of King
George, about 1995 if you

00:30:37.501 --> 00:30:43.755
ever want to--
it describes this aspect of his

00:30:43.755 --> 00:30:44.798
life.
 

00:30:44.798 --> 00:30:48.230
Leeches, another form of this
bloodletting was,

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:51.759
instead of taking a razor blade
or a blade and cutting a vein,

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:55.170
which is hard to sew up,
leeches are wonderful.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:59.180
You stick leeches on you and
the blood--

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.250
leeches suck out the blood and
we know this goes back at least

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:09.318
to the ancient Romans and it was
practiced for 2000 years,

00:31:09.318 --> 00:31:11.997
this bloodletting,
on this ancient theory of the

00:31:11.997 --> 00:31:12.509
humors.
 

00:31:12.509 --> 00:31:16.261
1860, we have data,
in the hospitals just in

00:31:16.261 --> 00:31:20.190
London, so in 1860 that was Rule
Britannia.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:24.238
England was the richest,
most educated ruler of the

00:31:24.238 --> 00:31:26.019
whole world in 1860.
 

00:31:26.019 --> 00:31:30.990
In the hospitals in one city,
London--7 million leeches were

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.578
used.
 

00:31:31.578 --> 00:31:38.118
The idea again being that until
you know what you're doing,

00:31:38.118 --> 00:31:41.573
you don't know what you're
doing and just use anything and

00:31:41.573 --> 00:31:44.612
it's all--
no evidence whatsoever that any

00:31:44.612 --> 00:31:47.650
of this ever helped anybody,
and of course we now know it

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.969
was in fact--
not only didn't it help them,

00:31:49.969 --> 00:31:51.358
it made them sicker.
 

00:31:51.358 --> 00:31:59.336
We now have sort of a rage in
America and Europe for natural

00:31:59.336 --> 00:32:04.338
medicine, and its various
versions.

00:32:04.338 --> 00:32:08.979
Well this has a very old
history and so how many know the

00:32:08.979 --> 00:32:12.115
author Wilkie Collins,
Moonstone,

00:32:12.115 --> 00:32:15.534
Woman in White,
it's one of the--they're on PBS

00:32:15.534 --> 00:32:19.400
Television all the time,
you've seen them.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:23.463
He had gout which was--what
happens is back then they ate a

00:32:23.463 --> 00:32:26.686
lot of meat, had a lot of
protein in the blood,

00:32:26.686 --> 00:32:29.490
the breakdown part,
protein is urea.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.730
If you don't excrete it fast
enough it's not very soluble.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.944
It crystallizes in your joints
and then every time you move a

00:32:35.944 --> 00:32:38.837
joint these little sharp
crystals grind in there and it

00:32:38.837 --> 00:32:42.000
makes it very hard to move and
your joints get swollen;

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.880
a very, very unpleasant disease.
 

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.288
What did they do for gout?
 

00:32:48.288 --> 00:32:52.702
Late in the 1880s they treated
gout with a poultice of cabbage

00:32:52.702 --> 00:32:56.894
leaves covered with silk,
with oiled silk,

00:32:56.894 --> 00:33:02.347
and this particular author,
Wilkie Collins wrote about it,

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:05.405
that's how we know some of the
details and it didn't give him

00:33:05.405 --> 00:33:06.680
any relief whatsoever.
 

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.440
Surprise, surprise.
 

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.647
What he did,
he turned to opium to dull the

00:33:10.647 --> 00:33:12.700
pain because opium really does
work,

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.526
it's the basis of morphine and
he probably died partly of opium

00:33:16.526 --> 00:33:20.230
poisoning because it does other
bad things to your system.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:24.316
Now continuing this story of
what happened,

00:33:24.316 --> 00:33:29.960
this all relates to death rates
in pre-scientific times.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.251
You American history buffs,
what happened to President

00:33:34.251 --> 00:33:35.630
James Garfield?
 

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:38.011
He was assassinated,
he was shot,

00:33:38.011 --> 00:33:41.587
but he wasn't really--
he was shot but he wasn't

00:33:41.587 --> 00:33:45.881
really assassinated because he
lived like for a year after he

00:33:45.881 --> 00:33:46.740
was shot.
 

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.342
So whether you call that
assassination or not,

00:33:49.342 --> 00:33:50.210
I don't know.
 

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:54.676
The bullet went in--apparently
into his back and lodged in some

00:33:54.676 --> 00:33:55.108
fat.
 

00:33:55.108 --> 00:33:58.338
Now fat is not very permeable
to anything,

00:33:58.338 --> 00:34:00.630
the bullet lodged in a lump of
fat,

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.699
the lead doesn't--the lead
poisoning from the bullet

00:34:02.699 --> 00:34:05.991
doesn't get out,
nothing much gets out so it's

00:34:05.991 --> 00:34:11.559
not a really dangerous thing to
have a bullet in a lump of fat.

00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:13.496
His doctors,
and some of them were

00:34:13.496 --> 00:34:15.692
homeopaths,
which was the big thing back

00:34:15.692 --> 00:34:20.077
then, and some were allopaths--
what those words mean you can

00:34:20.077 --> 00:34:25.300
ask me after class,
and they had opposing theories.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.659
Homeopaths thought that
whatever is wrong with you--

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:30.731
so I am telling you the
theories--whatever was wrong

00:34:30.731 --> 00:34:33.070
with you,
you should give a little bit of

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.518
the same thing and that would
cure you,

00:34:35.518 --> 00:34:37.784
and little bit meant you could
dilute it infinitely so that

00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:40.010
there's actually nothing in what
they were giving you,

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.760
maybe pure water but that was
supposed to cure you.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:45.889
Allopath was supposed to give
them something of the opposite,

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:48.329
and there's been--you can see
it in every drugstore nowadays,

00:34:48.329 --> 00:34:51.639
homeopathic remedy and what
that legally means is,

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:55.840
there's nothing in it but
that's okay.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.614
They had these opposite
theories and they kept fighting

00:34:59.614 --> 00:35:03.320
about what to do with this
President who was sick,

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.331
so what they did is,
they stuck metal rods into his

00:35:07.331 --> 00:35:12.224
wound to try to pull the bullet
out even though the bullet was

00:35:12.224 --> 00:35:16.376
doing no danger,
although sterilization--Lister

00:35:16.376 --> 00:35:19.021
had done his work--
was known already,

00:35:19.021 --> 00:35:21.190
these doctors didn't believe in
that,

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:25.909
so they stuck in these metal
rods with no sterilization.

00:35:25.909 --> 00:35:30.333
He of course got infected,
apparently not from the bullet

00:35:30.333 --> 00:35:34.440
because he lived a year,
but from the metal rods that

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.809
they kept poking into him.
 

00:35:36.809 --> 00:35:40.490
Their understanding of,
or their interest in,

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:45.427
physiology was so nil that they
insisted, for reasons that I

00:35:45.427 --> 00:35:49.110
have not found,
that he be fed rectally.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.891
They fed him beef bouillon,
egg yolks, milk,

00:35:53.891 --> 00:35:58.230
whiskey, and drops of opium
rectally.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:02.010
The problem is the rectum does
not absorb food;

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:06.465
the purpose of the rectum is to
take water out and conserve

00:36:06.465 --> 00:36:07.079
water.
 

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:10.344
They're feeding him this way,
this was the only way he was

00:36:10.344 --> 00:36:11.489
allowed to be fed.
 

00:36:11.489 --> 00:36:14.291
It's not healthy to put food in
this way and so what happens,

00:36:14.291 --> 00:36:15.599
what do you think happens?
 

00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:17.989
He loses weight;
how much does he lose?

00:36:17.989 --> 00:36:20.869
A 100 pounds from July to
September.

00:36:20.869 --> 00:36:24.000
In three months this guy loses
100 pounds.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.599
Does anybody notice this?
 

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:27.500
Does anybody pay attention to
this?

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.239
Does anybody have the
scientific cast of mind that,

00:36:30.239 --> 00:36:33.489
'well I have a theory and I'm
applying that theory,

00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:37.289
and, oh my, it's not working,
so maybe my theory is wrong.'

00:36:37.289 --> 00:36:41.659
No, that's just not the
critical scientific mindset.

00:36:41.659 --> 00:36:45.829
They knew that that was the
right thing to do and so they

00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:50.074
would not give up their theories
and basically it seems he

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:51.639
starved to death.
 

00:36:51.639 --> 00:36:56.440
They infected him and starved
him to death.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:03.925
What happens when new ideas do
come out in a pre-scientific

00:37:03.925 --> 00:37:04.699
era?
 

00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:08.077
One of the current public
health measures is you don't eat

00:37:08.077 --> 00:37:09.440
food with your hands.
 

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.139
Your mother tells you that all
the time,

00:37:11.139 --> 00:37:13.530
because you wash your hands
first which they didn't do,

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:15.840
but even then you eat with a
knife and fork,

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.710
which your mother has--or your
dishwasher has--

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:22.030
cleaned very nicely.
 

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:24.949
Europeans of course,
as you've seen from any movie,

00:37:24.949 --> 00:37:28.739
ate with their hands for many
hundreds of years,

00:37:28.739 --> 00:37:32.246
but at that time the Arabs were
much more civilized then we

00:37:32.246 --> 00:37:35.382
were;
we, the Europeans,

00:37:35.382 --> 00:37:40.628
and so in the Levant,
the middle eastern coast there,

00:37:40.628 --> 00:37:43.496
where Venice had lots of
commerce they were already

00:37:43.496 --> 00:37:47.679
eating with knives and forks--
used a fork.

00:37:47.679 --> 00:37:51.356
Well this was first introduced
into the Europe by the Duke of

00:37:51.356 --> 00:37:53.260
Venice,
the Doge of Venice,

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.402
and his wife became aware that
the Arab civilization was doing

00:37:57.402 --> 00:38:01.206
this thing of eating with forks
and she thought she would

00:38:01.206 --> 00:38:04.059
introduce it into her dinner
parties.

00:38:04.059 --> 00:38:09.449
She started having forks at her
dinner parties.

00:38:09.449 --> 00:38:16.190
And the cardinal--one of the
cardinals at that time was St.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:21.885
Peter Damien and he says
that--he was just totally

00:38:21.885 --> 00:38:24.210
opposed to this.
 

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:27.706
And the idea was that the stuff
that you eat are animals and

00:38:27.706 --> 00:38:30.594
plants,
they're God's creations,

00:38:30.594 --> 00:38:36.141
and that by using a fork she
had set herself up above God's

00:38:36.141 --> 00:38:41.047
creation and the quote is,
"To touch meat with a fork

00:38:41.047 --> 00:38:44.992
was impiously to declare that
God's creatures were not worthy

00:38:44.992 --> 00:38:47.690
of being touched by human
hands."

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:52.681
That kind of phrase was
repeated all the way into the

00:38:52.681 --> 00:38:58.539
seventeenth century and forks
came very slowly into Europe.

00:38:58.539 --> 00:39:00.000
Lightning rods.
 

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.695
When Benjamin Franklin invented
lightning rods what was most

00:39:03.695 --> 00:39:05.949
likely to get struck by
lightning?

00:39:05.949 --> 00:39:08.447
It was a church steeple,
right, because they stuck up

00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:09.889
into the sky and had points.
 

00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:12.322
As you may know,
if you take physics points

00:39:12.322 --> 00:39:14.175
attract lightning,
pointy things,

00:39:14.175 --> 00:39:17.710
so churches were always getting
lightning and burned out.

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:21.039
Benjamin Franklin invents the
lightning rod,

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:24.014
and oh my God,
the opprobrium that he came

00:39:24.014 --> 00:39:27.570
under because lightning was
obviously one of God's

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.067
creations,
that he was punishing people

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:30.518
with it.
 

00:39:30.518 --> 00:39:35.947
Now Benjamin Franklin was
interfering with God's

00:39:35.947 --> 00:39:37.449
punishment.
 

00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:40.186
Going back to the family,
which is relevant to the

00:39:40.186 --> 00:39:42.030
population more than lightning.
 

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:48.130
So one of the--of this whole
brutal society in which life is

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:52.257
very insecure,
people are very violent to each

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:54.447
other,
they're not careful with their

00:39:54.447 --> 00:39:56.079
persons or anything like that.
 

00:39:56.079 --> 00:40:03.570
Childrearing practices don't
escape this whole context in

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.380
which people lived.
 

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.960
And the traditional Christian
view in the West,

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.471
and this was strongly
reinforced by Calvinist theology

00:40:15.471 --> 00:40:19.043
after the reformation,
was that children were born

00:40:19.043 --> 00:40:20.059
with original sin.
 

00:40:20.059 --> 00:40:22.768
Original sin is the view of
human nature.

00:40:22.768 --> 00:40:25.250
What is human nature considered
to be in these times?

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:28.849
Now we think of human nature as
genes versus environment,

00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:32.704
but back then it was original
sin and children were born into

00:40:32.704 --> 00:40:33.219
sin.
 

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:37.231
The only hope of holding the
sin in check was thought to be

00:40:37.231 --> 00:40:41.175
the most ruthless repression of
child's will and its total

00:40:41.175 --> 00:40:44.289
subordination to the will of the
parents.

00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:48.155
He was subordinate to his
parents, to school masters,

00:40:48.155 --> 00:40:51.130
and to anyone with authority
over him.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:55.478
Theologians and moralists
insisted that parents ruthlessly

00:40:55.478 --> 00:40:59.521
crush the wills of young
children by physical force if

00:40:59.521 --> 00:41:00.590
necessary.
 

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:02.929
That has political
ramifications.

00:41:02.929 --> 00:41:05.699
If you're taught when you're
young,

00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:08.168
and your parents believe,
that the most moral thing is

00:41:08.168 --> 00:41:11.365
that you must be obedient,
you must not have a will of

00:41:11.365 --> 00:41:14.373
your own;
this leads you to believe that

00:41:14.373 --> 00:41:18.400
authoritarian political
structures are the normal and

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.809
right way that humans should be
governed.

00:41:21.809 --> 00:41:26.411
The American Puritans were very
much a part of this and the

00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:30.777
primary concern with respect to
childbearing of American

00:41:30.777 --> 00:41:35.380
Puritans was in making children
sin free enough to merit an

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:38.112
afterlife,
so they threatened totally

00:41:38.112 --> 00:41:41.250
healthy children by telling them
that they would soon die.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.485
Jonathan Edwards,
for whom one of the Yale

00:41:43.485 --> 00:41:46.268
Colleges is named and he was
President of Princeton,

00:41:46.268 --> 00:41:51.010
he was not President of Yale;
once I said he was I was wrong.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:54.340
He lectured a group of
children: "I know you will

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.659
die in little time.
 

00:41:55.659 --> 00:41:57.400
Some sooner than others.
 

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.219
It is not likely you will all
live to grow up."

00:42:00.219 --> 00:42:05.248
Children's storybooks,
one of the popular children's

00:42:05.248 --> 00:42:08.896
books was A Token for
Children:

00:42:08.896 --> 00:42:15.255
"If other children die,
why may not you sicken and

00:42:15.255 --> 00:42:16.570
die?"
 

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:19.159
Again, we try to protect our
children nowadays,

00:42:19.159 --> 00:42:22.545
nurturing, loving,
try to protect our children

00:42:22.545 --> 00:42:27.059
from these worries but back then
it (1) it was a reality,

00:42:27.059 --> 00:42:32.826
and (2) that reality was used
to suppress their-- what was

00:42:32.826 --> 00:42:38.490
called then their will and
subject them to enforcement by

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:40.110
the parents.
 

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:43.409
Of course in the literature
there's a--

00:42:43.409 --> 00:42:47.155
this sort of reading of history
came about 50 years ago when

00:42:47.155 --> 00:42:50.963
this was sort of noticed and
there's been a large reaction to

00:42:50.963 --> 00:42:53.233
it that no--
some parents at least were

00:42:53.233 --> 00:42:55.840
loving during this long stretch
of European history,

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:59.679
and of course,
not all parents were sort of--

00:42:59.679 --> 00:43:03.489
so brutal to their children but
some were.

00:43:03.489 --> 00:43:07.675
They were--one of the things
was to force a child into the

00:43:07.675 --> 00:43:11.788
mold, the behavioral mold that
you like and also into the

00:43:11.788 --> 00:43:13.110
physical mold.
 

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:16.059
So girls were supposed to have
narrow bodices,

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:19.380
narrow waists,
there's at least one case on

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:24.440
record where a girl was put into
an iron cage to squeeze her,

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.311
and as she grew older the cage
squeezed more and more and she

00:43:28.311 --> 00:43:32.246
couldn't breathe and she died of
suffocation from being put in

00:43:32.246 --> 00:43:35.925
this iron cage to mold her
physical body to the shape that

00:43:35.925 --> 00:43:37.989
was wanted by the parents.
 

00:43:37.989 --> 00:43:43.485
The conclusion is that life in
this pre-- modern,

00:43:43.485 --> 00:43:50.014
pre-scientific times was not
only sort of miserable in the

00:43:50.014 --> 00:43:58.030
physical sense but probably also
quite miserable in an emotional,

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.849
inward kind of sense.
 

00:43:59.849 --> 00:44:05.983
That people were not warm and
loving to each other very much

00:44:05.983 --> 00:44:11.804
but very frequently cold and
disciplining and controlling

00:44:11.804 --> 00:44:13.780
kind of people.
 

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:19.043
We have some centuries of this
period and you can go back to

00:44:19.043 --> 00:44:23.862
maybe the fall of the Roman
Empire when really learning

00:44:23.862 --> 00:44:28.949
about reality in the West kind
of stopped with the fall of

00:44:28.949 --> 00:44:32.032
Rome,
so you have more than 1,000

00:44:32.032 --> 00:44:35.612
years where sort of no
intellectual progress with

00:44:35.612 --> 00:44:37.849
respect to reality is made.
 

00:44:37.849 --> 00:44:43.090
Then things all of a sudden
start to change and we're going

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.349
to talk about that now.
 

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:51.144
Within 200 years the death rate
falls dramatically and so has

00:44:51.144 --> 00:44:54.719
the birth rate--falls
dramatically.

00:44:54.719 --> 00:44:58.679
These changes are sort of the
centerpiece of what,

00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:00.246
of course in
demography--historical

00:45:00.246 --> 00:45:02.230
demography anybody that usually
studies--

00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:04.780
is called the demographic
transition: the fall in the

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.940
death rate and the fall in the
birth rate.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.954
You'll hear this many times
because it's so basic that in

00:45:10.954 --> 00:45:14.036
these periods,
old periods the birth rate is

00:45:14.036 --> 00:45:17.119
very high, the death rate is
very high.

00:45:17.119 --> 00:45:23.175
They're about equal so
population basically grows not

00:45:23.175 --> 00:45:26.670
at all or very,
very slowly.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.599
What we're going to talk about
now in turn is first,

00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:34.242
the fall in the death rate,
and the second,

00:45:34.242 --> 00:45:40.545
then the fall in the birth
rate, and then theories that we

00:45:40.545 --> 00:45:47.398
have to explain these enormous
changes in what it means to be a

00:45:47.398 --> 00:45:49.389
human being.
 

00:45:49.389 --> 00:45:53.889
What happened--we don't know
the causes or we have many,

00:45:53.889 --> 00:45:55.199
many theories.
 

00:45:55.199 --> 00:45:57.519
Maybe we many,
many times know what the causes

00:45:57.519 --> 00:45:57.829
are.
 

00:45:57.829 --> 00:46:03.880
One of the standard textbooks
of European History says--

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:08.813
this is going back to the wars
of religion which is just before

00:46:08.813 --> 00:46:13.110
all these changes started
happening before Galileo,

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.431
for instance--"One thing
was clear, 130 years of

00:46:16.431 --> 00:46:20.009
senseless bloodletting in the
name of religion inevitably

00:46:20.009 --> 00:46:23.969
sparked off a reaction in the
minds of intelligent people.

00:46:23.969 --> 00:46:28.534
The wars of religion offered
fertile soil for the fragile

00:46:28.534 --> 00:46:30.980
seeds of reason and science.
 

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:35.235
People began to realize that
religiosity was hostile to

00:46:35.235 --> 00:46:36.889
civilization."
 

00:46:36.889 --> 00:46:39.748
Europeans say,
because of this period of sort

00:46:39.748 --> 00:46:43.255
of utter irrationality,
that the bad results of it were

00:46:43.255 --> 00:46:45.789
so immediately obvious to
everyone.

00:46:45.789 --> 00:46:49.041
Everyone was getting scared of
getting killed by the people in

00:46:49.041 --> 00:46:51.920
the neighboring town who were of
the other religion;

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:57.313
they rejected all that and were
ready for some sort of a

00:46:57.313 --> 00:47:00.650
rational attitude toward things.
 

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:08.380
The results of that we can see
were really quite dramatic.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:13.695
Here is what we can reconstruct
of life expectancy and going

00:47:13.695 --> 00:47:18.739
back 8,000 years ago where the
records are very poor,

00:47:18.739 --> 00:47:20.989
but it certainly wasn't much
better than this.

00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:25.353
And there was wavering,
and probably some slow increase

00:47:25.353 --> 00:47:27.050
in life expectancy.
 

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:31.501
This, just above 20 years of
life expectancy is what I showed

00:47:31.501 --> 00:47:35.878
you in the graph of Cisalpine
Gaul from Roman Times and what

00:47:35.878 --> 00:47:40.402
I've told you is true of Europe
during these hundreds of years

00:47:40.402 --> 00:47:43.000
that I've been talking about.
 

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.730
That stays more or less the
same with perhaps some

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:46.510
improvement.
 

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.251
It doesn't matter whether
you're looking at France-the

00:47:49.251 --> 00:47:52.199
dotted line, or you're looking
at China-the solid line.

00:47:52.199 --> 00:47:57.188
As far as we can tell they're
pretty much the same until

00:47:57.188 --> 00:48:01.083
around 1700,
all of a sudden something

00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:05.849
majorly changes and the life
expectancy goes--

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:07.449
starts going sky high.
 

00:48:07.449 --> 00:48:10.579
We're talking about not just
one of many,

00:48:10.579 --> 00:48:13.943
many things that happened in
history that you can take all

00:48:13.943 --> 00:48:17.735
kinds of history courses about,
but in terms of what it means

00:48:17.735 --> 00:48:22.157
to be a human,
you finally can stay alive

00:48:22.157 --> 00:48:25.860
beyond the age of 20 or 25.
 

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:31.976
That is such a tremendous
change in life that there's

00:48:31.976 --> 00:48:35.268
nothing else as important.
 

00:48:35.268 --> 00:48:39.686
Of course a large part of this,
to reinforce this,

00:48:39.686 --> 00:48:41.760
was infant mortality.
 

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:46.769
Look what happens,
back here it's going up and

00:48:46.769 --> 00:48:50.889
down like crazy and it's very
high.

00:48:50.889 --> 00:48:55.764
This a quarter of children and
this is European data,

00:48:55.764 --> 00:49:00.920
so this is about a fifth to a
quarter of children die as

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.389
children and it's out of
control.

00:49:04.389 --> 00:49:07.934
You can see that the epidemics
come through and then times get

00:49:07.934 --> 00:49:10.432
good, and then something else
comes through,

00:49:10.432 --> 00:49:12.989
and so it's very variable and
very high.

00:49:12.989 --> 00:49:18.065
Then it starts swooping
downward, and not only does it

00:49:18.065 --> 00:49:22.871
come down but it evens out,
that we start getting control,

00:49:22.871 --> 00:49:26.800
not only over the overall level
but all the things which cause

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.539
these wild swings in it.
 

00:49:28.539 --> 00:49:35.780
Again, an amazing change in
what it means to be human.

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:39.050
Well what is this date where
things start happening?

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:42.454
1770s we're into the
Enlightenment and you all have

00:49:42.454 --> 00:49:45.588
probably, at least in your high
school history,

00:49:45.588 --> 00:49:48.039
have heard of the
Enlightenment.

00:49:48.039 --> 00:49:53.137
And that is the big opening out
in Europe of rational discourse

00:49:53.137 --> 00:49:57.331
on almost everything,
and everything from science to

00:49:57.331 --> 00:49:58.400
politics.
 

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:02.485
Disease, for instance,
was considered divine

00:50:02.485 --> 00:50:07.998
punishment upon mankind for
their sins, that's a quote from

00:50:07.998 --> 00:50:09.329
somewhere.
 

00:50:09.329 --> 00:50:13.030
Medical research was considered
sacrilegious.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.847
Dissection of cadavers what
objected to because "If you

00:50:15.847 --> 00:50:18.523
cut the bodies into pieces
what's going to happen to them

00:50:18.523 --> 00:50:20.530
at the time of the
resurrection?"

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:24.947
There are all kinds of reasons
that you shouldn't do anything

00:50:24.947 --> 00:50:28.922
to get even the most basic
knowledge of what's inside a

00:50:28.922 --> 00:50:33.340
human body and without that you
can't make any progress.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:38.398
The major, major event in the
enlightenment is Newton's

00:50:38.398 --> 00:50:40.179
Principia.
 

00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:43.860
Newton's discussion of
something that sounds rather

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.670
abstract.
 

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:47.659
What he was worried about was
how the bodies go around in

00:50:47.659 --> 00:50:48.139
heaven.
 

00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:50.750
That's what everyone was trying
to figure out.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:54.925
You may remember Copernicus had
already said that things didn't

00:50:54.925 --> 00:50:58.695
go around the earth but they
went around the sun that was

00:50:58.695 --> 00:50:59.369
older.
 

00:50:59.369 --> 00:51:01.668
Keppler had gotten the
mathematics right,

00:51:01.668 --> 00:51:04.541
so they went around not in
circles but in ellipses,

00:51:04.541 --> 00:51:07.070
but nobody had any explanation
for this.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:10.634
It was a simple theory;
it was great regularity,

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:13.018
but no one had any idea why.
 

00:51:13.018 --> 00:51:17.601
Newton's gravitation was what
made it rational in the sense of

00:51:17.601 --> 00:51:22.034
understanding that it was just a
simple force of gravity and

00:51:22.034 --> 00:51:25.039
people don't always understand
the--

00:51:25.039 --> 00:51:29.489
you know the story of the apple
dropping on his head?

00:51:29.489 --> 00:51:33.409
The story is that gave him the
idea of gravitation.

00:51:33.409 --> 00:51:37.246
Apparently--(1) the story is
probably apocryphal totally but

00:51:37.246 --> 00:51:41.083
the import is what everyone was
trying to figure out was the

00:51:41.083 --> 00:51:42.449
heavenly motions.
 

00:51:42.449 --> 00:51:44.737
The moon around the earth,
the earth around the sun,

00:51:44.737 --> 00:51:46.980
the planets around all of these
sorts of things.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:51.364
He goes to sleep under the tree
and the apple falls on his head

00:51:51.364 --> 00:51:55.887
and he wakes up and he realizes,
'oh my God the apple fell on my

00:51:55.887 --> 00:51:59.914
head for the same reason that
the moon is held in orbit around

00:51:59.914 --> 00:52:00.840
the earth.'
 

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.170
As you know if there was no
gravity the moon would just--

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:04.976
here's the earth,
the moon goes around,

00:52:04.976 --> 00:52:07.639
you shut off gravity the moon
goes off in a straight line

00:52:07.639 --> 00:52:08.210
forever.
 

00:52:08.210 --> 00:52:10.512
That was kind of understood
already by Galileo,

00:52:10.512 --> 00:52:13.418
that things in motion will go
in a straight line unless you

00:52:13.418 --> 00:52:14.670
pull them in somehow.
 

00:52:14.670 --> 00:52:17.461
They knew that the earth--the
moon was constantly falling

00:52:17.461 --> 00:52:18.409
toward the earth.
 

00:52:18.409 --> 00:52:20.420
The earth was constantly
falling toward the sun;

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.849
all the planets were constantly
falling towards the sun.

00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:25.427
That was understood,
and they knew that apples fell

00:52:25.427 --> 00:52:28.518
to the earth but they didn't put
the two of them together.

00:52:28.518 --> 00:52:31.521
The great insight of Newton
apparently was realizing that

00:52:31.521 --> 00:52:34.469
this thing on earth that we
could observe and measure on

00:52:34.469 --> 00:52:37.753
earth,
was the same reason that the

00:52:37.753 --> 00:52:42.056
heavens worked,
and this was sort of a

00:52:42.056 --> 00:52:49.331
bombshell that led to the whole
theory of celestial mechanics

00:52:49.331 --> 00:52:56.001
and gravitation and all of
Western science really starts

00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:57.820
from this.
 

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:01.822
Within 25 years--and people
were--Newton was lionized during

00:53:01.822 --> 00:53:02.840
his lifetime.
 

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:08.119
It was realized what a
tremendous achievement this was,

00:53:08.119 --> 00:53:12.016
and the relationship to this is
not only the scientific

00:53:12.016 --> 00:53:16.275
achievement that the planets
orbited by the same force which

00:53:16.275 --> 00:53:19.773
drops an apple,
but it was previously believed

00:53:19.773 --> 00:53:23.536
that yes well events on earth
might work by some sort of

00:53:23.536 --> 00:53:26.480
physical laws,
you had Galileo working on

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:29.768
that, but heaven was ruled by
supernatural laws,

00:53:29.768 --> 00:53:31.969
and now Newton's great insight
was,

00:53:31.969 --> 00:53:33.619
no they're the same laws.
 

00:53:33.619 --> 00:53:36.150
That there's nothing special or
different about the heavens.

00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:41.210
That they work by exactly the
same laws as stones and apples

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:42.840
falling on earth.
 

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:46.606
This was really a tremendous
impetus to realize the power of

00:53:46.606 --> 00:53:50.311
rationality and so within 25
years the whole attitude about

00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:52.610
everything changes tremendously.
 

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:57.681
As the bubonic plague receded,
for reasons we don't know,

00:53:57.681 --> 00:54:02.842
that I showed you that data,
then smallpox starts becoming

00:54:02.842 --> 00:54:07.489
the leading cause of death;
one replacing the other.

00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:10.809
As opposed to what had gone on
before,

00:54:10.809 --> 00:54:12.900
which was supernatural ideas
about it,

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.699
in the 1710s very shortly after
Newton,

00:54:16.699 --> 00:54:18.880
The Royal Scientific Society
again started,

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:22.179
at this same time,
began a search program,

00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:25.670
research program to gather
information from any place in

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.289
the world on how smallpox could
be controlled or cured.

00:54:29.289 --> 00:54:32.706
Just a new kind of way of
dealing with disease that just

00:54:32.706 --> 00:54:36.000
hadn't been seen before,
and so what did they find?

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.096
They found that,
in Turkey, that they were

00:54:39.096 --> 00:54:42.344
inoculating people,
and what inoculation is,

00:54:42.344 --> 00:54:46.800
the early form--they take
someone that has the disease;

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:50.969
they take pus from the
disease--what is pus?

00:54:50.969 --> 00:54:54.784
It's white blood cells that
have eaten the virus or

00:54:54.784 --> 00:54:57.079
bacteria,
depending on whether it's

00:54:57.079 --> 00:54:59.929
plague or smallpox,
and have engulfed it and they

00:54:59.929 --> 00:55:02.599
kill the bacteria or virus,
the pathogen.

00:55:02.599 --> 00:55:05.570
You have a dead pathogen but
it's molecules are still there

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:09.253
and so you can take the pus,
inject it, just cut the skin,

00:55:09.253 --> 00:55:12.557
put it on a person,
and hopefully they're not

00:55:12.557 --> 00:55:16.280
exposed to anymore of the live
virus but the dead--

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:20.559
presumably the white blood
cells have killed the virus,

00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:25.545
and you just get their
molecules and that induces an

00:55:25.545 --> 00:55:31.018
immune reaction and you become
immune to this disease.

00:55:31.018 --> 00:55:34.976
Local governments started--I'll
tell you more about smallpox in

00:55:34.976 --> 00:55:36.380
a couple of minutes.
 

00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:42.867
In 1750s, again this very early
time, local regulations for

00:55:42.867 --> 00:55:47.119
sewage disposal are getting
started.

00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:51.465
In the 1790s the rich start
using water closets which are

00:55:51.465 --> 00:55:53.250
toilets of some sort.
 

00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:58.076
Not only do they introduce
vaccination, but 1796 they try

00:55:58.076 --> 00:55:59.800
to make it better.
 

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:02.768
They don't just say,
oh this works by some magic,

00:56:02.768 --> 00:56:05.130
they try to figure out what it
makes it better,

00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:08.628
and Jenner discovers
vaccination, which is instead of

00:56:08.628 --> 00:56:11.590
using pus from a person who had
smallpox--

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:15.974
there's a very closely related
disease called cowpox which the

00:56:15.974 --> 00:56:19.094
cow maids--
the milk maids get very

00:56:19.094 --> 00:56:21.070
frequently,
and it was noticed,

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:22.980
because they're now observing
all these things,

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.909
that these women would get sick
but most of them would recover.

00:56:25.909 --> 00:56:29.407
This was a not a lethal
disease, so instead of taking

00:56:29.407 --> 00:56:34.646
the actual smallpox virus,
which vaccination--the early

00:56:34.646 --> 00:56:37.596
inoculation--
did not always work and you

00:56:37.596 --> 00:56:39.630
sometimes did catch the disease
and died.

00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:43.081
Taking it from cowpox rather
than smallpox was less

00:56:43.081 --> 00:56:45.952
dangerous,
but since the viruses are

00:56:45.952 --> 00:56:50.612
closely related to each other a
lot of the molecules are the

00:56:50.612 --> 00:56:57.081
same and you get--
from cowpox you get immunity to

00:56:57.081 --> 00:57:04.690
smallpox and so these diseases
start going down.

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:09.902
Not only in health but it
starts the industrial

00:57:09.902 --> 00:57:15.682
revolution, in 1711 James
Newcomen invents the steam

00:57:15.682 --> 00:57:16.929
engine.
 

00:57:16.929 --> 00:57:19.981
It's a very,
very inefficient steam engine,

00:57:19.981 --> 00:57:23.762
and it's used only where you
had--can have a very big

00:57:23.762 --> 00:57:27.760
placement and it's used to pump
water out of mines.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:32.134
Coal is becoming important for
England to fuel the industrial

00:57:32.134 --> 00:57:35.851
revolution, and you have mines
that are underground,

00:57:35.851 --> 00:57:38.039
and water seeps into them.
 

00:57:38.039 --> 00:57:41.204
You've got to suck out the
water, so how do you pump it

00:57:41.204 --> 00:57:43.550
out, well he invents the steam
engine.

00:57:43.550 --> 00:57:47.289
Then James Watt figures
out--looks at it more

00:57:47.289 --> 00:57:49.797
scientifically,
more rationally,

00:57:49.797 --> 00:57:52.978
and again just like inoculation
being supplanted with

00:57:52.978 --> 00:57:55.179
vaccination they start
improving.

00:57:55.179 --> 00:57:57.293
It's not just that something
works and our ancestors did it

00:57:57.293 --> 00:57:58.860
this way and we don't know why
it works,

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.916
we don't why care it works,
we do it the same way our

00:58:00.916 --> 00:58:01.550
ancestors did.
 

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:04.860
No they keep thinking about
what they're looking at,

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.570
what they're working on,
and he improves it and in this

00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:12.449
case what James Watt did is,
after the steam comes out,

00:58:12.449 --> 00:58:16.485
he had a condenser to condense
the steam so drop the pressure

00:58:16.485 --> 00:58:19.110
on one side of the piston going
out.

00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:22.030
Just by taking the condenser
instead of--

00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:25.114
letting--having a way of
cooling the steam really

00:58:25.114 --> 00:58:28.650
improves the efficiency of a
steam engine and now with a

00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:32.378
greater efficiency you can make
a smaller steam engine that

00:58:32.378 --> 00:58:35.931
works just as well,
and you can put it on wheels

00:58:35.931 --> 00:58:39.291
and you start getting the
railroad and all kinds of

00:58:39.291 --> 00:58:42.719
smaller factories can start
using steam engines.

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:48.411
In politics,
this idea is also terribly

00:58:48.411 --> 00:58:50.210
important.
 

00:58:50.210 --> 00:58:55.380
The previous idea was that of a
hierarchical system with God

00:58:55.380 --> 00:59:00.061
appointing kings being--
ruling over nobility and then

00:59:00.061 --> 00:59:03.289
everyone else must obey up this
chain.

00:59:03.289 --> 00:59:05.989
Well what is Newton's idea?
 

00:59:05.989 --> 00:59:09.739
That everything obeys the same
law: gravity.

00:59:09.739 --> 00:59:13.840
That the sun attracts the earth;
the earth attracts the sun,

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:14.860
equally and opposite.
 

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.199
There's no difference.
 

00:59:16.199 --> 00:59:18.592
The sun does not rule the
universe, it's not better then

00:59:18.592 --> 00:59:20.679
the earth, it works by exactly
the same rules.

00:59:20.679 --> 00:59:23.099
The sun and the earth,
the earth and the moon,

00:59:23.099 --> 00:59:27.101
everything acts by the same
rules, there is no need for some

00:59:27.101 --> 00:59:30.630
sort of central sentient
coordinator of all this,

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:34.659
but each individual planet,
each individual body,

00:59:34.659 --> 00:59:38.699
all bodies, apples,
working by their own laws,

00:59:38.699 --> 00:59:41.931
by the same laws as everyone
else the universe works

00:59:41.931 --> 00:59:42.820
beautifully.
 

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.059
In fact it works as it does it
work.

00:59:45.059 --> 00:59:49.657
This idea is very consciously
taken over into politics and the

00:59:49.657 --> 00:59:53.266
idea of democracy,
again changes that each person

00:59:53.266 --> 00:59:57.164
acting under his own desires,
his own self interest,

00:59:57.164 --> 01:00:01.742
his own morality can,
by interacting in the same way

01:00:01.742 --> 01:00:04.916
the planets do,
can come out with a system that

01:00:04.916 --> 01:00:05.289
works.
 

01:00:05.289 --> 01:00:10.018
The original theorists of
democracy were very conscious of

01:00:10.018 --> 01:00:14.666
this shift in the way they
looked at the way the universe

01:00:14.666 --> 01:00:17.820
worked and very conscious of
its--

01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:20.400
their debt to Newton on that.
 

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.451
In economics,
how many of you are economics

01:00:24.451 --> 01:00:25.320
majors?
 

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.070
The bust has really taken
effect;

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:29.670
we used to have lots of
economic majors.

01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:32.289
What is Adam Smith's idea?
 

01:00:32.289 --> 01:00:36.639
The basis of modern economics
is Adam Smith's--

01:00:36.639 --> 01:00:39.827
that no you don't need a
Mercantilist government to

01:00:39.827 --> 01:00:43.025
control everything,
that if each person acts in

01:00:43.025 --> 01:00:46.619
their own self interest by their
own internal rules,

01:00:46.619 --> 01:00:51.641
then the economy will work just
wonderfully and be more

01:00:51.641 --> 01:00:52.849
productive.
 

01:00:52.849 --> 01:00:55.780
Freedom of religion is again
the same thing,

01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:59.155
freedom of conscience,
it's a similar kind of idea

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:05.815
that each person has its own--
has his own way of working

01:01:05.815 --> 01:01:15.072
things out and that does not
destroy the harmony of the

01:01:15.072 --> 01:01:17.130
universe.
 

01:01:17.130 --> 01:01:24.994
We see that this rationality
changes everything about the way

01:01:24.994 --> 01:01:26.829
humans live.
 

01:01:26.829 --> 01:01:30.320
One of its most important
effects is demography.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:34.552
That the population stops dying
and can start increasing,

01:01:34.552 --> 01:01:37.199
and this is exactly what
happens.

01:01:37.199 --> 01:01:41.326
As all this rational attitude
toward death and toward disease

01:01:41.326 --> 01:01:44.047
starts taking hold,
the death rate falls

01:01:44.047 --> 01:01:47.905
tremendously as I've shown you,
the life expectancy goes up,

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:51.460
infant mortality goes down,
and population starts

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.389
increasing tremendously.
 

01:01:53.389 --> 01:01:55.583
Most people,
at that time,

01:01:55.583 --> 01:02:00.413
believed that a big population
was a wonderful thing and

01:02:00.413 --> 01:02:03.750
they're very optimistic about
it,

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:07.090
and one of the standard ways of
judging a government,

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.590
when you saw a country that had
a lot of people in it,

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:11.309
well obviously the government
was doing something right.

01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:15.032
The king at that time was doing
something right because people

01:02:15.032 --> 01:02:16.619
were able to stay alive.
 

01:02:16.619 --> 01:02:20.594
If you saw a country with a low
population, well something was

01:02:20.594 --> 01:02:23.592
wrong, and that was not
necessarily an improper

01:02:23.592 --> 01:02:24.440
attitude.
 

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.463
Up until Malthus,
with some exceptions,

01:02:27.463 --> 01:02:31.523
it was generally the idea that
there was no limit to

01:02:31.523 --> 01:02:36.059
population, that the more the
population the merrier.

01:02:36.059 --> 01:02:44.043
Malthus came along and said,
'hmm there is a problem with

01:02:44.043 --> 01:02:52.596
population,' and he had been
watching--he collected very good

01:02:52.596 --> 01:02:53.880
data.
 

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.320
You read his stuff,
it's really wonderful to read

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.577
because it's extremely modern in
that he tells you the data he is

01:02:59.577 --> 01:03:01.190
collecting;
he analyzes it;

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:03.911
he tells you what he--what's
wrong with the data,

01:03:03.911 --> 01:03:07.371
why he believes it to a certain
extent but not beyond that and

01:03:07.371 --> 01:03:09.130
all things about the data.
 

01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:15.117
Very--he's writing is like 1798
but it reads like a modern PhD

01:03:15.117 --> 01:03:17.179
thesis, just about.
 

01:03:17.179 --> 01:03:22.309
His knowledge was the
following, and it's very simple

01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:23.789
what he said.
 

01:03:23.789 --> 01:03:27.860
He did not say--many people
thought that--

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:31.000
as previous people had often
said like Edmond Burke,

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.260
who was the father of
conservatism,

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.306
that the economic pie is
constant, there's just so much

01:03:36.306 --> 01:03:39.503
stuff out there,
and the more people you just

01:03:39.503 --> 01:03:42.289
have to divide the pie smaller
and smaller.

01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:44.199
That's one way of looking at it.
 

01:03:44.199 --> 01:03:47.782
Then it's perfectly obvious
that population is a bad thing

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:51.744
because there's fixed production
and you have more people to eat

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:53.190
up that production.
 

01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:57.673
Malthus was much smarter,
by the time he wrote in 1798

01:03:57.673 --> 01:04:01.989
the Enlightenment had started to
produce results.

01:04:01.989 --> 01:04:06.418
He could see that agricultural
production was improving year by

01:04:06.418 --> 01:04:09.034
year;
modern methods were--modern at

01:04:09.034 --> 01:04:12.840
that time--were beginning to
take over and he knew that

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.179
production rose.
 

01:04:14.179 --> 01:04:17.630
What he assumed,
and what he saw from the data

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:20.469
was that production rose
linearly,

01:04:20.469 --> 01:04:24.994
that every year there was sort
of--you could produce a little

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:27.030
bit more out of the land.
 

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:30.340
Now he said,
but what about population?

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:34.804
In population if you have 100
people and they increase by

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:39.510
let's say 50% that's 150 people,
you've gained 50 people.

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:42.931
But now from the next
generation you again grow by

01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:46.842
50%, you're starting with 150
people you have--now you're

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:48.309
adding 75 people.
 

01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:57.719
The graph--this is time,
this is agricultural product,

01:04:57.719 --> 01:05:05.177
and Malthus said this is
growing like this,

01:05:05.177 --> 01:05:12.989
which was quite reasonable for
his time.

01:05:12.989 --> 01:05:18.789
Population, no matter where it
starts grows--

01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:22.300
he called it geometrically,
we call it exponentially,

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:29.268
so if it starts that there's
just enough food for people to

01:05:29.268 --> 01:05:32.990
eat,
then it almost immediately goes

01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:35.130
above food production.
 

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:38.260
If it starts even below,
it doesn't matter;

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.460
it eventually rises--catches up
with food production and goes

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.300
beyond it.
 

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:47.465
He believed that there was no
doubt that population increases

01:05:47.465 --> 01:05:50.311
geometrically,
or exponentially as we say,

01:05:50.311 --> 01:05:53.090
that means a certain percent a
year.

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:57.840
It may increase one percent a
year or two percent a year,

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.065
or three percent a year,
but remember that's one percent

01:06:01.065 --> 01:06:03.880
of an increasing number so it's
more and more.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:08.409
Whereas, agriculture he thought
increased linearly by the same

01:06:08.409 --> 01:06:12.268
fixed amount each year,
and if that's the case you're

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.719
going to run into starvation.
 

01:06:14.719 --> 01:06:22.869
He said, since population can
always outrun productivity,

01:06:22.869 --> 01:06:26.101
eventually you get into
trouble, that whenever you

01:06:26.101 --> 01:06:30.865
increase the number of people--
if you ever--you're at some

01:06:30.865 --> 01:06:35.007
sort of stasis level,
where resources fit the

01:06:35.007 --> 01:06:36.018
population.
 

01:06:36.018 --> 01:06:40.679
But then as you get some
increase in productivity it

01:06:40.679 --> 01:06:45.250
allows a rise in population only
to match that,

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:48.822
but then the greater number of
people eat up that increase in

01:06:48.822 --> 01:06:52.039
productivity so you're right
back down to where he--

01:06:52.039 --> 01:06:54.110
you started with.
 

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:59.639
His idea was that increasing
population was not a good thing.

01:06:59.639 --> 01:07:04.579
It could not lead to any
improvement if it outran your

01:07:04.579 --> 01:07:08.492
productivity gains,
and this led to all kinds of

01:07:08.492 --> 01:07:11.554
what we now consider very
conservative and even

01:07:11.554 --> 01:07:13.750
retrogressive political ideas.
 

01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:17.070
So poor laws--he was initially
against poor laws.

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:20.650
There's no sense to keep the
poor alive because if you keep

01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:24.043
them alive they're going to
reproduce and make even more

01:07:24.043 --> 01:07:27.809
children and you're right back
to where you started from.

01:07:27.809 --> 01:07:33.400
He was a strong conservative in
that sense.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.739
He later changed his mind as he
got smarter about things.

01:07:36.739 --> 01:07:40.039
He was also aware of,
even though population could

01:07:40.039 --> 01:07:42.867
increase like this,
maybe and he was aware,

01:07:42.867 --> 01:07:46.840
that people were smart enough
to stop this in some way.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.407
He knew about various methods
of contraception,

01:07:50.407 --> 01:07:54.364
withdrawal and so forth,
and various perverse sexual

01:07:54.364 --> 01:07:55.449
practices.
 

01:07:55.449 --> 01:07:58.590
But he was so opposed to them
morally,

01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:00.806
as was everyone else in his
time, that you should not

01:08:00.806 --> 01:08:02.885
control reproduction,
that that was immoral,

01:08:02.885 --> 01:08:05.239
but he said 'people are never
going to do that.'

01:08:05.239 --> 01:08:09.527
That what happens to balance it
is not people themselves

01:08:09.527 --> 01:08:12.880
controlling this in a very
rational way,

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.909
which he thought was not
possible at that time,

01:08:15.909 --> 01:08:20.069
but famine would come in,
disease would come in,

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:22.341
and whenever your population
got too big people would get

01:08:22.341 --> 01:08:22.828
very poor.
 

01:08:22.828 --> 01:08:25.840
They were open to some disease,
the disease would wipe you out.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:30.229
You either starved directly
immediately from too much--

01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:34.670
the population getting ahead of
agriculture productivity,

01:08:34.670 --> 01:08:38.708
you either starved or you got
to so weak that diseases come

01:08:38.708 --> 01:08:40.590
through and wipe you out.
 

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:46.779
Okay we will--time is up we
will continue onward next time.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.027
Professor Paul Bloom:
We're going to begin the class

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:20.647
proper, Introduction to
Psychology, with a discussion

00:00:20.647 --> 00:00:23.821
about the brain.
And, in particular,

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:28.978
I want to lead off the class
with an idea that the Nobel

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:32.841
Prize winning biologist,
Francis Crick,

00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:36.930
described as "The Astonishing
Hypothesis."

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.410
And The Astonishing Hypothesis
is summarized like this.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.610
As he writes,
The Astonishing Hypothesis is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.597
that:
You, your joys and your

00:00:46.597 --> 00:00:49.570
sorrows, your memories and your
ambitions, your sense of

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.759
personal identity and free will
are in fact no more than the

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:56.111
behavior of a vast assembly of
nerve cells and their associated

00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:59.271
molecules.
As Lewis Carroll's Alice might

00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:02.634
have phrased it,
"you're nothing but a pack of

00:01:02.634 --> 00:01:05.849
neurons."
It is fair to describe this as

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:09.091
astonishing.
It is an odd and unnatural view

00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:13.719
and I don't actually expect
people to believe it at first.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.474
It's an open question whether
you'll believe it when this

00:01:17.474 --> 00:01:21.027
class comes to an end,
but I'd be surprised if many of

00:01:21.027 --> 00:01:23.970
you believe it now.
Most people don't.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.010
Most people,
in fact, hold a different view.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.591
Most people are dualists.
Now, dualism is a very

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:36.276
different doctrine.
It's a doctrine that can be

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:40.127
found in every religion and in
most philosophical systems

00:01:40.127 --> 00:01:43.562
throughout history.
It was very explicit in Plato,

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:46.640
for instance.
But the most articulate and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.920
well-known defender of dualism
is the philosopher Rene

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.003
Descartes,
and Rene Descartes explicitly

00:01:55.003 --> 00:01:59.604
asked a question,
"Are humans merely physical

00:01:59.604 --> 00:02:01.990
machines,
merely physical things?"

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.325
And he answered, "no."
He agreed that animals are

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:09.604
machines.
In fact, he called them "beast

00:02:09.604 --> 00:02:13.627
machines" and said animals,
nonhuman animals are merely

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:16.310
robots, but people are
different.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.004
There's a duality of people.
Like animals,

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:24.309
we possess physical material
bodies, but unlike animals,

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:29.368
what we are is not physical.
We are immaterial souls that

00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:33.061
possess physical bodies,
that have physical bodies,

00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:37.123
that reside in physical bodies,
that connect to physical

00:02:37.123 --> 00:02:39.676
bodies.
So, this is known as dualism

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:42.116
because the claim is,
for humans at least,

00:02:42.116 --> 00:02:46.255
there are two separate things;
there's our material bodies and

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:50.430
there's our immaterial minds.
Now, Descartes made two

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.972
arguments for dualism.
One argument involved

00:02:54.972 --> 00:03:00.994
observations of a human action.
So, Descartes lived in a fairly

00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:04.629
sophisticated time,
and his time did have robots.

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.469
These were not electrical
robots, of course.

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.770
They were robots powered by
hydraulics.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.485
So, Descartes would walk around
the French Royal Gardens and the

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:16.905
French Royal Gardens were set up
like a seventeenth-century

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.628
Disneyland.
They had these characters that

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:23.488
would operate according to water
flow and so if you stepped on a

00:03:23.488 --> 00:03:26.777
certain panel,
a swordsman would jump out with

00:03:26.777 --> 00:03:29.250
a sword.
If you stepped somewhere else,

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.889
a bathing beauty would cover
herself up behind some bushes.

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.750
And Descartes said,
"Boy, these machines respond in

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.151
certain ways to certain actions
so machines can do certain

00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:43.081
things and,
in fact," he says,

00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:45.761
"our bodies work that way too.
If you tap somebody on the

00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:49.770
knee, your leg will jump out.
Well, maybe that's what we are."

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.897
But Descartes said that can't
be because there are things that

00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:56.740
humans do that no machine could
ever do.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.389
Humans are not limited to
reflexive action.

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.696
Rather, humans are capable of
coordinated, creative,

00:04:04.696 --> 00:04:07.717
spontaneous things.
We can use language,

00:04:07.717 --> 00:04:09.961
for instance,
and sometimes my use of

00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:13.020
language can be reflexive.
Somebody says, "How are you?"

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.750
And I say, "I am fine.
How are you?"

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.128
But sometimes I could say what
I choose to be,

00:04:19.128 --> 00:04:21.130
"How are you?"
"Pretty damn good."

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.763
I can just choose.
And machines,

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:26.430
Descartes argued,
are incapable of that sort of

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.930
choice.
Hence, we are not mere machines.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.353
The second argument is,
of course, quite famous and

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:37.746
this was the method.
This he came to using the

00:04:37.746 --> 00:04:40.915
method of doubt.
So, he started asking himself

00:04:40.915 --> 00:04:43.449
the question,
"What can I be sure of?"

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.653
And he said,
"Well, I believe there's a God,

00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:50.079
but honestly,
I can't be sure there's a God.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:53.436
I believe I live in a rich
country but maybe I've been

00:04:53.436 --> 00:04:55.170
fooled."
He even said,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:00.248
"I believe I have had friends
and family but maybe I am being

00:05:00.248 --> 00:05:02.554
tricked.
Maybe an evil demon,

00:05:02.554 --> 00:05:04.478
for instance,
has tricked me,

00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:08.464
has deluded me into thinking I
have experiences that aren't

00:05:08.464 --> 00:05:10.198
real."
And, of course,

00:05:10.198 --> 00:05:12.939
the modern version of this is
The Matrix.

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:15.488
The idea of The Matrix is
explicitly built upon

00:05:15.488 --> 00:05:18.370
Cartesian--Descartes' worries
about an evil demon.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.879
Maybe everything you're now
experiencing is not real,

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.862
but rather is the product of
some other, perhaps malevolent,

00:05:25.862 --> 00:05:28.778
creature.
Descartes, similarly,

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:33.009
could doubt he has a body.
In fact, he noticed that madmen

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.813
sometimes believe they have
extra limbs or they believe

00:05:35.813 --> 00:05:38.981
they're of different sizes and
shapes than they really are and

00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:41.740
Descartes said,
"How do I know I'm not crazy?

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.738
Crazy people don't think
they're crazy so the fact that I

00:05:44.738 --> 00:05:47.470
don't think I'm crazy doesn't
mean I'm not crazy.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.550
How do I know," Descartes said,
"I'm not dreaming right now?"

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.163
But there is one thing,
Descartes concluded,

00:05:54.163 --> 00:05:57.080
that he cannot doubt,
and the answer is he cannot

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.390
doubt that he is himself
thinking.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.574
That would be self-refuting.
And so, Descartes used the

00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:08.832
method of doubt to say there's
something really different about

00:06:08.832 --> 00:06:13.920
having a body that's always
uncertain from having a mind.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.823
And he used this argument as a
way to support dualism,

00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:23.727
as a way to support the idea
that bodies and minds are

00:06:23.727 --> 00:06:26.077
separate.
And so he concluded,

00:06:26.077 --> 00:06:29.575
"I knew that I was a substance,
the whole essence or nature of

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:32.470
which is to think,
and that for its existence,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.852
there is no need of any place
nor does it depend on any

00:06:35.852 --> 00:06:38.404
material thing.
That is to say,

00:06:38.404 --> 00:06:43.530
the soul by which I am,
when I am, is entirely distinct

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.698
from body."
Now, I said before that this is

00:06:46.698 --> 00:06:49.842
common sense and I want to
illustrate the common sense

00:06:49.842 --> 00:06:53.894
nature of this in a few ways.
One thing is our dualism is

00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:57.712
enmeshed in our language.
So, we have a certain mode of

00:06:57.712 --> 00:07:01.438
talking about things that we own
or things that are close to us

00:07:01.438 --> 00:07:03.643
– my arm,
my heart, my child,

00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:07.949
my car – but we also extend
that to my body and my brain.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.246
We talk about owning our brains
as if we're somehow separate

00:07:12.246 --> 00:07:14.733
from them.
Our dualism shows up in

00:07:14.733 --> 00:07:17.259
intuitions about personal
identity.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.394
And what this means is that
common sense tells us that

00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:25.995
somebody can be the same person
even if their body undergoes

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:31.491
radical and profound changes.
The best examples of this are

00:07:31.491 --> 00:07:34.228
fictional.
So, we have no problem

00:07:34.228 --> 00:07:38.223
understanding a movie where
somebody goes to sleep as a

00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:41.184
teenager and wakes up as
Jennifer Garner,

00:07:41.184 --> 00:07:44.300
as an older person.
Now, nobody says,

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.872
"Oh, that's a documentary.
I believe that thoroughly true"

00:07:48.872 --> 00:07:52.970
but at the same time nobody,
no adult, no teenager,

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.908
no child ever leaves and says,
"I'm totally conceptually

00:07:55.908 --> 00:08:01.389
confused."
Rather, we follow the story.

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:05.551
We can also follow stories
which involve more profound

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:10.342
transformations as when a man
dies and is reborn into the body

00:08:10.342 --> 00:08:13.198
of a child.
Now, you might have different

00:08:13.198 --> 00:08:16.785
views around--People around this
room will have different views

00:08:16.785 --> 00:08:19.390
as to whether reincarnation
really exists,

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.769
but we can imagine it.
We could imagine a person dying

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.870
and then reemerging in another
body.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.890
This is not Hollywood invention.
One of the great short stories

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.932
of the last century begins with
a sentence by Franz Kafka:

00:08:31.932 --> 00:08:34.919
"As Gregor Samsa woke one
morning from uneasy dreams,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.470
he found himself transformed in
his bed into a gigantic insect."

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:43.515
And again, Kafka invites us to
imagine waking up into a body of

00:08:43.515 --> 00:08:47.409
a cockroach and we can.
This is also not modern.

00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:51.360
Hundreds of years before the
birth of Christ,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.927
Homer described the fate of the
companions of Odysseus who were

00:08:56.927 --> 00:09:00.250
transformed by a witch into
pigs.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.690
Actually, that's not quite
right.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.620
She didn't turn them into pigs.
She did something worse.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.809
She stuck them in the bodies of
pigs.

00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:11.833
They had the head and voice and
bristles and body of swine but

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:14.807
their minds remained unchanged
as before, so they were penned

00:09:14.807 --> 00:09:17.572
there weeping.
And we are invited to imagine

00:09:17.572 --> 00:09:21.252
the fate of again finding
ourselves in the bodies of other

00:09:21.252 --> 00:09:24.169
creatures and,
if you can imagine this,

00:09:24.169 --> 00:09:27.808
this is because you are
imagining what you are as

00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:31.220
separate from the body that you
reside in.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.629
We allow for the notion that
many people can occupy one body.

00:09:34.629 --> 00:09:37.651
This is a mainstay of some
slapstick humor including the

00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:40.068
classic movie,
All of Me--Steve Martin

00:09:40.068 --> 00:09:42.429
and Lily Tomlin – highly
recommended.

00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:46.360
But many people think this sort
of thing really happens.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.298
One analysis of multiple
personality disorder is that you

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:54.236
have many people inside a single
body fighting it out for

00:09:54.236 --> 00:09:56.632
control.
Now, we will discuss multiple

00:09:56.632 --> 00:10:00.058
personality disorder towards the
end of the semester and it turns

00:10:00.058 --> 00:10:03.110
out things are a good deal more
complicated than this,

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.298
but still my point isn't about
how it really is but how we

00:10:06.298 --> 00:10:09.121
think about it.
Common sense tells us you could

00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:12.019
have more than one person inside
a single body.

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:15.843
This shows up in a different
context involving exorcisms

00:10:15.843 --> 00:10:19.806
where many belief systems allow
for the idea that people's

00:10:19.806 --> 00:10:22.419
behavior,
particularly their evil or

00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:25.772
irrational behavior,
could be because something else

00:10:25.772 --> 00:10:31.714
has taken over their bodies.
Finally, most people around the

00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:39.396
world, all religions and most
people in most countries at most

00:10:39.396 --> 00:10:42.530
times,
believe that people can survive

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:47.523
the destruction of their bodies.
Now, cultures differ according

00:10:47.523 --> 00:10:51.415
to the fate of the body.
Some cultures have the body

00:10:51.415 --> 00:10:53.590
going to--sorry--the fate of the
soul.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.009
Some cultures have you going to
Heaven or descending to Hell.

00:10:57.009 --> 00:10:59.279
Others have you occupying
another body.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:02.625
Still, others have you
occupying an amorphous spirit

00:11:02.625 --> 00:11:04.974
world.
But what they share is the idea

00:11:04.974 --> 00:11:08.388
that what you are is separable
from this physical thing you

00:11:08.388 --> 00:11:12.740
carry around.
And the physical thing that you

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:18.129
carry around can be destroyed
while you live on.

00:11:18.129 --> 00:11:22.029
These views are particularly
common in the United States.

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:25.042
In one survey done in Chicago a
few years ago,

00:11:25.042 --> 00:11:28.457
people were asked their
religion and then were asked

00:11:28.457 --> 00:11:31.470
what would happen to them when
they died.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.257
Most people in the sample were
Christian and about 96% of

00:11:35.257 --> 00:11:38.368
Christians said,
"When I die I'm going to go to

00:11:38.368 --> 00:11:41.000
Heaven."
Some of the sample was Jewish.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.829
Now, Judaism is actually a
religion with a less than clear

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:48.742
story about the afterlife.
Still, most of the subjects who

00:11:48.742 --> 00:11:52.807
identified themselves as Jewish
said when they die they will go

00:11:52.807 --> 00:11:55.015
to Heaven.
Some of the sampled denied

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:58.299
having any religion at all--said
they have no religion at all.

00:11:58.299 --> 00:12:02.063
Still, when these people were
asked what would happen when

00:12:02.063 --> 00:12:04.506
they would die,
most of them answered,

00:12:04.506 --> 00:12:09.210
"I'm going to go to Heaven."
So, dualism is emmeshed.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.980
A lot rests on it but,
as Crick points out;

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.080
the scientific consensus now is
that dualism is wrong.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:24.269
There is no "you" separable or
separate from your body.

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:27.522
In particular,
there is no "you" separable

00:12:27.522 --> 00:12:30.852
from your brain.
To put it the way cognitive

00:12:30.852 --> 00:12:35.292
scientists and psychologists and
neuroscientists like to put it,

00:12:35.292 --> 00:12:37.899
"the mind is what the brain
does."

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:42.096
The mind reflects the workings
of the brain just like

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:46.049
computation reflects the working
of a computer.

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:49.570
Now, why would you hold such an
outrageous view?

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.610
Why would you reject dualism in
favor of this alternative?

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.980
Well, a few reasons.
One reason is dualism has

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.504
always had its problems.
For one thing,

00:12:58.504 --> 00:13:00.860
it's a profoundly unscientific
doctrine.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.752
We want to know as curious
people how children learn

00:13:04.752 --> 00:13:08.491
language, what we find
attractive or unattractive,

00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:11.850
and what's the basis for mental
illness.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:15.190
And dualism simply says,
"it's all nonphysical,

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:19.330
it's part of the ether," and
hence fails to explain it.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.951
More specifically,
dualists like Descartes

00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:27.633
struggle to explain how a
physical body connects to an

00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:30.750
immaterial soul.
What's the conduit?

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:32.370
How could this connection be
made?

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.953
After all, Descartes knew full
well that there is such a

00:13:35.953 --> 00:13:39.559
connection.
Your body obeys your commands.

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:43.419
If you bang your toe or stub
your toe you feel pain.

00:13:43.419 --> 00:13:46.401
If you drink alcohol it affects
your reasoning,

00:13:46.401 --> 00:13:49.966
but he could only wave his
hands as to how this physical

00:13:49.966 --> 00:13:53.790
thing in the world could connect
to an immaterial mind.

00:13:57.409 --> 00:14:02.023
Descartes, when he was alive,
was reasonable enough

00:14:02.023 --> 00:14:07.559
concluding that physical objects
cannot do certain things.

00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:10.797
He was reasonable enough in
concluding, for instance,

00:14:10.797 --> 00:14:14.532
as he did, that there's no way
a merely physical object could

00:14:14.532 --> 00:14:17.583
ever play a game of chess
because--and that such a

00:14:17.583 --> 00:14:21.443
capacity is beyond the capacity
of the physical world and hence

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:25.054
you have to apply--you have to
extend the explanation to an

00:14:25.054 --> 00:14:28.478
immaterial soul but now we
know--we have what scientists

00:14:28.478 --> 00:14:32.769
call an existence proof.
We know physical objects can do

00:14:32.769 --> 00:14:35.149
complicated and interesting
things.

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:38.779
We know, for instance,
machines can play chess.

00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:40.950
We know machines can manipulate
symbols.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:45.133
We know machines have limited
capacities to engage in

00:14:45.133 --> 00:14:48.110
mathematical and logical
reasoning,

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:51.837
to recognize things,
to do various forms of

00:14:51.837 --> 00:14:55.298
computations,
and this makes it at least

00:14:55.298 --> 00:14:58.760
possible that we are such
machines.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.809
So you can no longer say, "Look.
Physical things just can't do

00:15:02.809 --> 00:15:06.368
that" because we know physical
things can do a lot and this

00:15:06.368 --> 00:15:10.049
opens up the possibility that
humans are physical things,

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:13.080
in particular,
that humans are brains.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.408
Finally, there is strong
evidence that the brain is

00:15:18.408 --> 00:15:22.765
involved in mental life.
Somebody who hold a--held a

00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:26.288
dualist view that said that what
we do and what we decide and

00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:29.870
what we think and what we want
are all have nothing to do with

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.285
the physical world,
would be embarrassed by the

00:15:33.285 --> 00:15:37.371
fact that the brain seems to
correspond in intricate and

00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:40.120
elaborate ways to our mental
life.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.039
Now, this has been known for a
long time.

00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:47.335
Philosophers and psychologists
knew for a long time that

00:15:47.335 --> 00:15:50.391
getting smacked in the head
could change your mental

00:15:50.391 --> 00:15:53.088
faculties;
that diseases like syphilis

00:15:53.088 --> 00:15:57.168
could make you deranged;
that chemicals like caffeine

00:15:57.168 --> 00:16:00.370
and alcohol can affect how you
think.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:03.906
But what's new is we can now in
different ways see the direct

00:16:03.906 --> 00:16:08.017
effects of mental life.
Somebody with a severe and

00:16:08.017 --> 00:16:13.394
profound loss of mental
faculties--the deficit will be

00:16:13.394 --> 00:16:17.250
shown correspondingly in her
brain.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.131
Studies using imaging
techniques like CAT scans,

00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:24.848
PET, and fMRI,
illustrate that different parts

00:16:24.848 --> 00:16:30.299
of the brain are active during
different parts of mental life.

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:32.931
For instance,
the difference between seeing

00:16:32.931 --> 00:16:36.000
words, hearing words,
reading words and generating

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.320
words can correspond to
different aspects of what part

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:42.261
of your brain is active.
To some extent,

00:16:42.261 --> 00:16:46.223
if we put you in an fMRI
scanner and observed what you're

00:16:46.223 --> 00:16:49.741
doing in real time,
by looking at the activity

00:16:49.741 --> 00:16:54.118
patterns in your brain we can
tell whether you are thinking

00:16:54.118 --> 00:16:56.909
about music or thinking about
sex.

00:16:56.909 --> 00:17:00.995
To some extent we can tell
whether you're solving a moral

00:17:00.995 --> 00:17:05.637
dilemma versus something else.
And this is no surprise if what

00:17:05.637 --> 00:17:08.986
we are is the workings of our
physical brains,

00:17:08.986 --> 00:17:13.750
but it is extremely difficult
to explain if one is a dualist.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:18.505
Now, so what you have is--the
scientific consensus is that all

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:22.714
of mental life including
consciousness and emotions and

00:17:22.714 --> 00:17:27.470
choice and morality are the
products of brain activities.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:32.558
So, you would expect that when
you rip open the skull and look

00:17:32.558 --> 00:17:35.873
at the brain;
you'd see something glorious,

00:17:35.873 --> 00:17:40.070
you'd see – I don't know –
a big, shiny thing with glass

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.410
tubes and blinding lights and
sparks and wonderful colors.

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.820
And actually though,
the brain is just disgusting.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:54.054
It looks like an old meat loaf.
It's gray when you take it out

00:17:54.054 --> 00:17:56.805
of the head.
It's called gray matter but

00:17:56.805 --> 00:17:59.099
that's just because it's out of
the head.

00:17:59.099 --> 00:18:03.300
Inside the head it's bright red
because it's pulsing with blood.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.569
It doesn't even taste good.
Well, has anybody here ever

00:18:08.569 --> 00:18:09.460
eaten brain?

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.431
It's good with cream sauce but
everything's good with cream

00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:19.521
sauce.
So, the question is,

00:18:19.521 --> 00:18:25.660
"How can something like this
give rise to us?"

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.069
And you have to have some
sympathy for Descartes.

00:18:29.069 --> 00:18:31.485
There's another argument
Descartes could have made that's

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:33.470
a lot less subtle than the ones
he did make,

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.582
which is "That thing
responsible for free will and

00:18:37.582 --> 00:18:41.049
love and consciousness?
Ridiculous."

00:18:41.049 --> 00:18:44.050
What I want to do,
and what the goal of

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.920
neuroscience is,
is to make it less ridiculous,

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.943
to try to explain how the brain
works, how the brain can give

00:18:52.943 --> 00:18:56.327
rise to thought,
and what I want to do today is

00:18:56.327 --> 00:18:59.580
take a first stab at this
question but it's something

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.146
we'll continue to discuss
throughout the course as we talk

00:19:03.146 --> 00:19:05.900
about different aspects of
mental life.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:09.029
What I want to do though now is
provide a big picture.

00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:12.542
So, what I want to do is start
off small, with the smallest

00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:16.115
interesting part of the brain
and then get bigger and bigger

00:19:16.115 --> 00:19:19.869
and bigger – talk about how
the small part of the brain,

00:19:19.869 --> 00:19:22.161
the neurons,
the basic building blocks of

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:25.655
thought, combine to other mental
structures and into different

00:19:25.655 --> 00:19:28.920
subparts of the brain and
finally to the whole thing.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:35.167
So, one of the discoveries of
psychology is that the basic

00:19:35.167 --> 00:19:40.099
unit of the brain appears to be
the neuron.

00:19:40.099 --> 00:19:44.431
The neuron is a specific sort
of cell and the neuron has three

00:19:44.431 --> 00:19:47.910
major parts, as you could see
illustrated here.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.879
Neurons actually look quite
different from one another but

00:19:50.879 --> 00:19:54.661
this is a typical one.
There are the dendrites –

00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:59.972
these little tentacles here.
And the dendrites get signals

00:19:59.972 --> 00:20:03.309
from other neurons.
Now, these signals can be

00:20:03.309 --> 00:20:06.160
either excitatory,
which is that they raise the

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.076
likelihood the neuron will fire,
or inhibitory in that they

00:20:10.076 --> 00:20:13.299
lower the likelihood that the
neuron will fire.

00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:16.029
The cell body sums it up and
you could view it

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:19.706
arithmetically.
The excitatory signals are

00:20:19.706 --> 00:20:23.880
pluses, the inhibitory ones are
minuses.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.660
And then if you get a certain
number, plus 60 or something,

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.789
the neuron will fire and it
fires along the axon,

00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:34.651
the thing to the right.
The axon is much longer than

00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:38.104
the dendrites and,
in fact, some axons are many

00:20:38.104 --> 00:20:41.652
feet long.
There's an axon leading from

00:20:41.652 --> 00:20:45.970
your spinal cord to your big toe
for instance.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:50.099
It is so shocking the lights go
out.

00:20:50.099 --> 00:20:54.289
Surrounded--Surrounding--To
complete a mechanical metaphor

00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:58.111
that would have led Descartes to
despair-- Thank you,

00:20:58.111 --> 00:21:00.970
Koleen.
Surrounding the axon is a

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.922
myelin sheath,
which is actually just

00:21:03.922 --> 00:21:06.771
insulation.
It helps the firing work

00:21:06.771 --> 00:21:09.424
quicker.
So, here are some facts about

00:21:09.424 --> 00:21:12.122
neurons.
There are a lot of them –

00:21:12.122 --> 00:21:16.727
about one thousand billion of
them – and each neuron can be

00:21:16.727 --> 00:21:20.851
connected to around thousands,
perhaps tens of thousands,

00:21:20.851 --> 00:21:24.081
other neurons.
So, it's an extraordinarily

00:21:24.081 --> 00:21:29.140
complicated computing device.
Neurons come in three flavors.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.129
There are sensory neurons,
which take information from the

00:21:32.129 --> 00:21:34.354
world so as you see me,
for instance,

00:21:34.354 --> 00:21:38.505
there are neurons firing from
your retina sending signals to

00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:41.119
your brain.
There are motor neurons.

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:45.046
If you decide to raise your
hand, those are motor neurons

00:21:45.046 --> 00:21:49.657
telling the muscles what to do.
And there are interneurons

00:21:49.657 --> 00:21:52.535
which connect the two.
And basically,

00:21:52.535 --> 00:21:54.589
the interneurons do the
thinking.

00:21:54.589 --> 00:21:58.759
They make the connection
between sensation and action.

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:02.182
It used to be believed,
and it's the sort of thing I

00:22:02.182 --> 00:22:06.344
would--when I taught this course
many years ago I would lecture

00:22:06.344 --> 00:22:10.170
on--that neurons do not grow
back once you lose them.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.680
You never get them back.
This is actually not true.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.940
There are parts of the brain in
which neurons can re-grow.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.537
One interesting thing about
neurons is a neuron is like a

00:22:22.537 --> 00:22:25.450
gun.
It either fires or it doesn't.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.284
It's all or nothing.
If you squeeze the trigger of a

00:22:29.284 --> 00:22:33.130
gun really hard and really fast,
it doesn't fire any faster or

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.030
harder than if you just squeezed
it gently.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:41.754
Now, this seems to be strange.
How could neurons be all or

00:22:41.754 --> 00:22:45.009
nothing when sensation is very
graded?

00:22:45.009 --> 00:22:49.029
If somebody next to you pushed
on your hand--the degree of

00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:51.710
pushing--you'd be able to notice
it.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.160
It's not either pushing or not
pushing.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.634
You can--Degrees of pushing,
degrees of heat,

00:22:56.634 --> 00:22:59.482
degrees of brightness.
And the answer is,

00:22:59.482 --> 00:23:02.552
although neurons are all or
nothing, there are ways to code

00:23:02.552 --> 00:23:04.803
intensity.
So, one simple way to code

00:23:04.803 --> 00:23:07.390
intensity is the number of
neurons firing;

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.609
the more neurons the more
intense.

00:23:11.609 --> 00:23:18.242
Another way to increase
intensity is the frequency of

00:23:18.242 --> 00:23:23.650
firing.
So, I'll just use those two.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.259
The first one is the number of
neurons firing.

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:29.753
The second one is the frequency
of firing in that something is

00:23:29.753 --> 00:23:32.995
more intense if it's "bang,
bang, bang, bang,

00:23:32.995 --> 00:23:36.826
bang, bang" then "bang,
bang, bang" and these are two

00:23:36.826 --> 00:23:40.509
ways through which neurons
encode intensity.

00:23:40.509 --> 00:23:45.323
Now, neurons are connected and
they talk to one another and it

00:23:45.323 --> 00:23:49.584
used to be thought they were
tied to one another like a

00:23:49.584 --> 00:23:52.042
computer,
like you take wires and you

00:23:52.042 --> 00:23:54.801
connect wires to each other,
you wrap them around and

00:23:54.801 --> 00:23:57.646
connect them.
It turns out this isn't the

00:23:57.646 --> 00:23:59.518
case.
It turns out that neurons

00:23:59.518 --> 00:24:03.119
relate to one another chemically
in a kind of interesting way.

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:06.825
Between any neurons,
between the axon of one neuron

00:24:06.825 --> 00:24:10.529
and the dendrite of another,
there's a tiny gap.

00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:14.065
The gap could be about one
ten-thousandths of a millimeter

00:24:14.065 --> 00:24:16.489
wide.
This infinitesimal gap--and

00:24:16.489 --> 00:24:20.172
this gap is known as a
synapse--and what happens is

00:24:20.172 --> 00:24:23.339
when a neuron fires,
an axon sends chemicals

00:24:23.339 --> 00:24:27.393
shooting through the gap.
These chemicals are known as

00:24:27.393 --> 00:24:30.619
neurotransmitters and they
affect the dendrites.

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:33.960
So, neurons communicate to one
another chemically.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.569
These--Again,
the chemicals could excite the

00:24:37.569 --> 00:24:42.522
other neuron (excitatory) bring
up the chances it will fire,

00:24:42.522 --> 00:24:46.299
or inhibit the other neuron
(inhibitory).

00:24:46.299 --> 00:24:52.146
Now, neurotransmitters become
interesting because a lot of

00:24:52.146 --> 00:24:56.442
psychopharmacology,
both of the medical sort and

00:24:56.442 --> 00:25:00.039
the recreational sort,
consists of fiddling with

00:25:00.039 --> 00:25:04.248
neurotransmitters and so you
could see this through some

00:25:04.248 --> 00:25:07.607
examples.
There are two sorts of ways you

00:25:07.607 --> 00:25:10.190
could fiddle with
neurotransmitters,

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:13.290
and correspondingly two sorts
of drugs.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:16.931
There are agonists.
And what an agonist does is

00:25:16.931 --> 00:25:19.848
increases the effect of
neurotransmitters,

00:25:19.848 --> 00:25:23.406
either by making more
neurotransmitters or stopping

00:25:23.406 --> 00:25:26.109
the cleanup of
neurotransmitters,

00:25:26.109 --> 00:25:28.710
or in some cases by faking a
neurotransmitter,

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.912
by mimicking its effects.
Then, there are antagonists

00:25:31.912 --> 00:25:34.710
that slow down the amount of
neurotransmitters,

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:38.176
either because they destroy
neurotransmitters or they make

00:25:38.176 --> 00:25:41.689
it hard to create more.
Or in some cases they go to the

00:25:41.689 --> 00:25:45.251
dendrite of the neuron and they
kind of put a paste over it so

00:25:45.251 --> 00:25:47.819
that the neurotransmitters can't
connect.

00:25:47.819 --> 00:25:51.727
And it's through these clever
ways that neurons can affect

00:25:51.727 --> 00:25:53.030
your mental life.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:26:03.786
So, for instance,
there is a drug known as Curare

00:26:03.786 --> 00:26:10.397
and Curare is an antagonist.
It's a very particular sort of

00:26:10.397 --> 00:26:14.072
antagonist.
It blocks motor neurons from

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:18.415
affecting muscle fibers.
What this does then is it

00:26:18.415 --> 00:26:22.832
paralyzes you because your motor
neurons--You send the command to

00:26:22.832 --> 00:26:25.110
your arm to stand,
to lift up.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.760
It doesn't work.
You send the command to your

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.609
leg to move.
It doesn't work.

00:26:29.609 --> 00:26:33.208
The motor neurons are
deactivated and then,

00:26:33.208 --> 00:26:37.663
because the way you breathe is
through motor neurons,

00:26:37.663 --> 00:26:40.810
you then die.
There's alcohol.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.884
Alcohol is inhibitory.
Now, this may be puzzling to

00:26:44.884 --> 00:26:47.309
people.
It's mildly paradoxical because

00:26:47.309 --> 00:26:50.359
you may be thinking,
"alcohol is not inhibitory.

00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:53.285
On the contrary,
when I drink a lot of alcohol I

00:26:53.285 --> 00:26:56.460
lose my inhibitions and become a
more fun person.

00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:01.337
I become more aggressive and
more sexually vibrant and simply

00:27:01.337 --> 00:27:06.496
more beautiful.
And so in what way is alcohol

00:27:06.496 --> 00:27:11.391
inhibitory?"
Well, the answer is it inhibits

00:27:11.391 --> 00:27:15.109
the inhibitory parts of your
brain.

00:27:15.109 --> 00:27:17.677
So, you have parts of your
brain that are basically telling

00:27:17.677 --> 00:27:20.200
you now, largely in the frontal
lobes, that are--"Okay.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.790
Keep your pants on.
Don't hit me, buddy.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.918
Don't use bad words."
Alcohol relaxes,

00:27:26.918 --> 00:27:30.289
shuts down those parts of the
brain.

00:27:30.289 --> 00:27:33.820
If you take enough alcohol,
it then goes down to inhibit

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:37.543
the excitatory parts of your
brain and then you fall on the

00:27:37.543 --> 00:27:41.946
floor and pass out.
Amphetamines increase the

00:27:41.946 --> 00:27:45.270
amount of arousal.
In particular,

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.571
they increase the amount of
norepinephrine,

00:27:48.571 --> 00:27:52.738
a neurotransmitter that's
responsible for just general

00:27:52.738 --> 00:27:56.275
arousal.
And so, amphetamines include

00:27:56.275 --> 00:28:04.548
drugs like "speed" and "coke."
There are--Prozac works on

00:28:04.548 --> 00:28:08.441
serotonin.
When we discuss clinical

00:28:08.441 --> 00:28:12.109
psychology and depression we'll
learn the extent to which

00:28:12.109 --> 00:28:16.104
neurotransmitter disorders are
implicated in certain disorders

00:28:16.104 --> 00:28:20.183
like depression.
And one problem is that – for

00:28:20.183 --> 00:28:25.591
depression – is that there's
too little of a neurotransmitter

00:28:25.591 --> 00:28:30.010
known as serotonin.
Prozac makes serotonin more

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:36.029
prevalent and so in some extent
might help alleviate depression.

00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:40.055
Parkinson's disease is a
disease involving destruction of

00:28:40.055 --> 00:28:44.440
motor control and loss of motor
control, difficulty moving.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.892
And one factor in Parkinson's
is too little of a

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:50.609
neurotransmitter known as
dopamine.

00:28:50.609 --> 00:28:54.645
The drug L-DOPA increases the
supply of dopamine and so there

00:28:54.645 --> 00:28:57.807
is something to alleviate,
at least temporarily,

00:28:57.807 --> 00:29:01.319
the symptoms of Parkinson's.
So, you have neurons and

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:04.720
they're clustered together and
they fire and they communicate

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.700
to one another.
So, how does this all work to

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.960
give rise to creatures who could
do interesting things like talk

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.643
and think?
Well, again,

00:29:13.643 --> 00:29:17.326
it used to be believed that the
brain is wired up like a

00:29:17.326 --> 00:29:20.195
computer,
like a PC or a Mac or something

00:29:20.195 --> 00:29:23.059
like that, but we know this
can't be true.

00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:26.757
It can't be true because
there's two ways in which the

00:29:26.757 --> 00:29:30.771
brain is better than a computer.
For one thing,

00:29:30.771 --> 00:29:35.579
the brain is highly resistant
to damage.

00:29:35.579 --> 00:29:40.298
If you have a laptop and I
persuade you to open it up for

00:29:40.298 --> 00:29:44.594
me and I take the pliers and
kind of snip just about

00:29:44.594 --> 00:29:47.544
anywhere,
your laptop will be destroyed

00:29:47.544 --> 00:29:50.230
but the brain is actually more
resilient.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:54.044
You can take a lot of brain
damage and still preserve some

00:29:54.044 --> 00:29:57.048
mental functioning.
To some interesting sense,

00:29:57.048 --> 00:30:00.676
there's some sort of damage
resistance built in to the brain

00:30:00.676 --> 00:30:04.365
that allows different parts of
the brain to take over if some

00:30:04.365 --> 00:30:08.110
parts are damaged.
A second consideration is the

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:12.964
brain is extremely fast.
Your computer works on wires

00:30:12.964 --> 00:30:18.551
and electricity but your brain
uses tissue and tissue is

00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:22.236
extremely slow.
The paradox then is how do you

00:30:22.236 --> 00:30:25.330
create such a fast computer with
such slow stuff?

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.621
And you can't.
If the brain was wired up like

00:30:28.621 --> 00:30:31.972
a personal computer,
it would take you four hours to

00:30:31.972 --> 00:30:35.040
recognize a face but,
in fact, we could do things

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.691
extremely quickly.
So, the question then is how is

00:30:38.691 --> 00:30:41.720
the brain wired up?
And the answer is,

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.869
unlike manys,
unlike commercially generated

00:30:44.869 --> 00:30:49.220
computers, the brain works
through parallel processing,

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.480
massively parallel distributed
processing.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.371
There's a whole lot of research
and this is research,

00:30:55.371 --> 00:30:58.429
some of which takes place
outside psychology departments

00:30:58.429 --> 00:31:01.209
and in engineering departments
and computer science

00:31:01.209 --> 00:31:04.813
departments,
trying to figure out how a

00:31:04.813 --> 00:31:09.519
computer can do the same things
brains can do.

00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:13.772
And one way people do this is
they take a hint from nature and

00:31:13.772 --> 00:31:17.746
they try to construct massively
distributed networks to do

00:31:17.746 --> 00:31:21.411
aspects of reasoning.
So, there's a very simple

00:31:21.411 --> 00:31:25.138
computational network.
That is interesting because it

00:31:25.138 --> 00:31:28.858
kind of looks to some extent
like the way neurons look and

00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:31.599
this is often known as neural
networks.

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:35.538
And people who study this often
claim to be studying neural

00:31:35.538 --> 00:31:39.815
network modeling to try to build
smart machines by modeling them

00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:43.023
after brains.
And in the last 20 years or so,

00:31:43.023 --> 00:31:46.401
this has been a huge and
vibrant area of study where

00:31:46.401 --> 00:31:50.309
people are trying to wire up
machines that can do brain-like

00:31:50.309 --> 00:31:54.548
things from components that look
a lot like neurons and are wired

00:31:54.548 --> 00:31:58.867
up together as neurons are.
One consideration in all of

00:31:58.867 --> 00:32:03.384
this is that this is a very
young field and nobody knows how

00:32:03.384 --> 00:32:07.076
to do it yet.
There is no machine yet that

00:32:07.076 --> 00:32:11.393
can recognize faces or
understand sentences at the

00:32:11.393 --> 00:32:15.605
level of a two-year-old human.
There is no machine yet that

00:32:15.605 --> 00:32:18.263
can do just about anything
people can do in an interesting

00:32:18.263 --> 00:32:19.304
way.
And this is,

00:32:19.304 --> 00:32:22.219
in part, because the human
brain is wired up in an

00:32:22.219 --> 00:32:25.730
extraordinarily more complicated
way than any sort of simple

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:29.092
neural network.
This is a sort of schematic

00:32:29.092 --> 00:32:33.035
diagram – you're not
responsible for this – of

00:32:33.035 --> 00:32:37.478
parts of the visual cortex,
and the thing to realize about

00:32:37.478 --> 00:32:40.250
this is it's extraordinarily
simplified.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:43.589
So, the brain is a complicated
system.

00:32:43.589 --> 00:32:48.066
Now, so, we've talked a little
bit about the basic building

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:52.265
blocks of the brain – neurons.
We've then talked about how

00:32:52.265 --> 00:32:54.599
neurons can communicate to one
another;

00:32:54.599 --> 00:32:59.109
then, turned to how neurons are
wired up together.

00:32:59.109 --> 00:33:02.113
Now let's talk a little bit
about different parts of the

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:04.548
brain.
Now, there's some things you

00:33:04.548 --> 00:33:07.259
don't actually need your brain
to do.

00:33:07.259 --> 00:33:10.721
The study of what you don't
need your brain to do has often

00:33:10.721 --> 00:33:13.585
drawn upon this weird
methodology where--This was

00:33:13.585 --> 00:33:16.927
actually done in France a lot
where they would decapitate

00:33:16.927 --> 00:33:20.089
people and when--After they
decapitated people,

00:33:20.089 --> 00:33:23.572
psychologists would rush to the
body of the headless person and

00:33:23.572 --> 00:33:26.549
sort of just test out reflexes
and stuff like that.

00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:29.443
It's kind of gruesome but we
know there are some things you

00:33:29.443 --> 00:33:33.402
don't need your brain for.
You don't need your brain for

00:33:33.402 --> 00:33:37.291
newborn sucking,
limb flexation in withdrawal

00:33:37.291 --> 00:33:40.418
from pain.
Your limbs will pull back even

00:33:40.418 --> 00:33:43.762
if your head is gone.
Erection of the penis can be

00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:46.822
done without a brain.
Vomiting also is done without a

00:33:46.822 --> 00:33:47.380
brain.
Oh.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:52.079
I need a volunteer.
Very simple.

00:33:52.079 --> 00:33:54.940
This will not involve any
of--excellent--any of the above.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:59.204
Could you stand up just--Okay.
This is a new shirt so I want

00:33:59.204 --> 00:34:00.720
to stay away.
Just--No.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.504
This is--If you'll hold out
your hand and--one hand flat.

00:34:05.504 --> 00:34:07.639
Excellent.
That's the textbook,

00:34:07.639 --> 00:34:10.370
5th edition.
Now.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.423
Perfect.
What you'll notice is--Thank

00:34:13.423 --> 00:34:16.099
you very much.
What you'll notice is this hit

00:34:16.099 --> 00:34:20.093
and this hand went back up.
This is something automatic,

00:34:20.093 --> 00:34:22.978
instinctive,
and does not require your

00:34:22.978 --> 00:34:25.444
brain.
So your brain isn't needed for

00:34:25.444 --> 00:34:28.309
everything.
What does your brain do?

00:34:28.309 --> 00:34:31.486
Well, some things that your
brain does involve very

00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:34.901
low-level internal structures.
And these are called

00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:38.840
subcortical structures because
they're below the cortex.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.998
They're underneath the cortex.
So, for instance,

00:34:41.998 --> 00:34:44.880
what we have here is a diagram
of the brain.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:48.308
The way to read this diagram is
it's as if it were my brain and

00:34:48.308 --> 00:34:52.394
I am facing this way.
My head gets cut in half down

00:34:52.394 --> 00:34:56.180
here and then you could see the
brain.

00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:00.409
So, this is the front over here.
That's the back.

00:35:00.409 --> 00:35:02.820
Some key parts are illustrated
here.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:05.265
The medulla,
for instance,

00:35:05.265 --> 00:35:09.960
is responsible for heart rate
and respiration.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.289
It's very deep within the brain
and if it gets damaged you

00:35:13.289 --> 00:35:17.463
could--you are likely to die.
The cerebellum is responsible

00:35:17.463 --> 00:35:21.050
for body balance and muscular
coordination.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.640
And to give you,
again, a feeling for the

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.943
complexity of these systems,
the cerebellum contains

00:35:26.943 --> 00:35:29.340
approximately 30 billion
neurons.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.718
The hypothalamus is responsible
here for feeding,

00:35:33.718 --> 00:35:37.639
hunger, thirst,
and to some extent sleep.

00:35:37.639 --> 00:35:41.889
And here is the same brain
parts in close-up.

00:35:41.889 --> 00:35:47.000
Now, all of these parts of the
brains are essential and many of

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.874
them are implicated in
interesting psychological

00:35:50.874 --> 00:35:55.160
processes but where the action
is is the cortex.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.893
Isn't this beautiful?
The cortex is the outer layer

00:35:59.893 --> 00:36:02.960
and the outer layer is all
crumpled up.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.320
Do you ever wonder why your
brain looks wrinkled?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.670
That's because it's all
crumpled.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:12.976
If you took out somebody's
cortex and flattened it out,

00:36:12.976 --> 00:36:17.362
it would be two feet square,
sort of like a nice--like a

00:36:17.362 --> 00:36:21.517
rug.
And the cortex is where all the

00:36:21.517 --> 00:36:26.021
neat stuff takes place.
Fish don't have any of that,

00:36:26.021 --> 00:36:29.585
so no offense to fish but
it's--fish don't have much of a

00:36:29.585 --> 00:36:32.254
mental life.
Reptiles and birds have a

00:36:32.254 --> 00:36:36.437
little bit about it--of it--and
primates have a lot and humans

00:36:36.437 --> 00:36:40.292
have a real lot.
Eighty percent of the volume of

00:36:40.292 --> 00:36:42.679
our brain, about,
is cortex.

00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:50.780
And the cortex can be broken up
into different parts or lobes.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.572
There is the--And,
again, this is facing in

00:36:53.572 --> 00:36:56.176
profile forward.
There is the frontal lobe,

00:36:56.176 --> 00:36:59.298
easy to remember.
This part in front,

00:36:59.298 --> 00:37:03.482
the parietal lobe,
the occipital lobe,

00:37:03.482 --> 00:37:08.062
and the temporal lobe.
And one theme we're going to

00:37:08.062 --> 00:37:10.440
return to is--this is half the
brain.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.559
This is, in fact,
the left half of the brain.

00:37:15.559 --> 00:37:17.676
On the other half,
the right half,

00:37:17.676 --> 00:37:20.883
everything's duplicated with
some slight and subtle

00:37:20.883 --> 00:37:24.551
differences.
What's really weird--One really

00:37:24.551 --> 00:37:29.918
weird finding about these lobes
is that they include topological

00:37:29.918 --> 00:37:33.030
maps.
They include maps of your body.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.778
There is a cartoon which
actually illustrates a classic

00:37:36.778 --> 00:37:41.151
experiment by some physiologists
who for some reason had a dog's

00:37:41.151 --> 00:37:45.177
brain opened up and started
shocking different parts of the

00:37:45.177 --> 00:37:47.463
brain.
You could do brain surgery

00:37:47.463 --> 00:37:50.705
while fully conscious because
the brain itself has no sense

00:37:50.705 --> 00:37:53.021
organs to it.
And it turns out that the

00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:56.318
dog--When they zapped part of
its brain, its leg would kick

00:37:56.318 --> 00:37:57.973
up.
And it took Dr.

00:37:57.973 --> 00:38:02.704
Penfield at McGill University
to do the same thing with

00:38:02.704 --> 00:38:04.833
people.
So, they were doing some brain

00:38:04.833 --> 00:38:06.609
surgery.
He had a little electrical

00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:09.570
thing just on--I don't know how
he thought to do this.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:11.969
He started zapping it and
"boom."

00:38:11.969 --> 00:38:14.750
The person--Parts of their body
would move.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.810
More than that,
when he zapped other parts of

00:38:17.810 --> 00:38:21.010
the brain, people would claim to
see colors.

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:22.840
And he zapped other parts of
the brain;

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.389
people would claim to hear
sounds;

00:38:25.389 --> 00:38:29.839
and other parts of the brain,
people would claim to

00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:33.712
experience touch.
And through his research and

00:38:33.712 --> 00:38:36.987
other research,
it was found that there are

00:38:36.987 --> 00:38:41.514
maps in the brain of the body.
There is a map in the motor

00:38:41.514 --> 00:38:44.047
part of the brain,
the motor cortex,

00:38:44.047 --> 00:38:48.390
of the sort up on the left and
the sensory cortex of the sort

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.805
that you could see on the right
and if you--and you could tell

00:38:52.805 --> 00:38:56.931
what's what by opening up the
brain and shocking different

00:38:56.931 --> 00:39:01.057
parts and those parts would
correspond to the parts of the

00:39:01.057 --> 00:39:06.758
body shown in the diagram there.
Now, two things to notice about

00:39:06.758 --> 00:39:09.198
these maps.
The first is they're

00:39:09.198 --> 00:39:13.225
topographical and what this
means is that if two parts of

00:39:13.225 --> 00:39:16.750
the--two parts are close
together on the body,

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:19.469
they'll be close together on
the brain.

00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:25.669
So, your tongue is closer to
your jaw than it is to your hip

00:39:25.669 --> 00:39:29.823
in the body;
so too in both the motor cortex

00:39:29.823 --> 00:39:34.299
and the somatosensory cortex.
Also, you'll notice that the

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:37.656
size of the body part
represented in the brain does

00:39:37.656 --> 00:39:42.019
not correspond to the size of
the body part in the real world.

00:39:42.019 --> 00:39:46.792
Rather, what determines the
size in the brain is the extent

00:39:46.792 --> 00:39:51.482
to which either they have motor
command over it or sensory

00:39:51.482 --> 00:39:53.766
control.
So, there's a whole lot of

00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:55.163
sensory organs,
for instance,

00:39:55.163 --> 00:39:58.575
focused along your tongue,
and that's why that's so big,

00:39:58.575 --> 00:40:02.505
and an enormous amount on your
face but your shoulder isn't

00:40:02.505 --> 00:40:05.690
even--doesn't even make it on
there because,

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:07.823
although your shoulder might be
bigger than your tongue,

00:40:07.823 --> 00:40:11.330
there's not much going on.
In fact, if you draw a diagram

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:16.253
of a person, what their body is
corresponding to the amount of

00:40:16.253 --> 00:40:20.530
somatosensory cortex,
you get something like that.

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.320
That's your sensory body.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:32.351
Now, so, you have these maps in
your head but the thing to

00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:35.849
realize is--And these maps are
part of your cortex,

00:40:35.849 --> 00:40:40.489
but the things to realize is
that's an important part of what

00:40:40.489 --> 00:40:45.128
goes on in your brain but less
than one quarter of the cortex

00:40:45.128 --> 00:40:48.530
contains these maps or
projection areas.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:53.076
The rest is involved in
language and reasoning and moral

00:40:53.076 --> 00:40:55.546
thought and so on.
And, in fact,

00:40:55.546 --> 00:40:58.684
the proportion as you go from
rat, cat, and monkey,

00:40:58.684 --> 00:41:02.514
humans--less and less of it is
devoted to projection and there

00:41:02.514 --> 00:41:04.900
is more and more to other
things.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:11.320
So, how do we figure out what
the other parts of the brain do?

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.980
Well, there's all sorts of
methods.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:18.239
Typically, these are recent
imaging methods like CAT scan

00:41:18.239 --> 00:41:22.465
and PET scan and fMRI which,
as I said before,

00:41:22.465 --> 00:41:25.940
show parts of your brain at
work.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.964
If you want to know which part
of your brain is responsible for

00:41:30.964 --> 00:41:35.826
language, you could put somebody
into a scanner and have them

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:40.121
exposed to language or do a
linguistic task or talk or

00:41:40.121 --> 00:41:45.469
something and then see what
parts of their brain are active.

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:49.838
Another way to explore what the
brain does is to consider what

00:41:49.838 --> 00:41:54.349
happens to people when very bad
things happen to their brain.

00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:58.156
And these bad things could
happen through lesions,

00:41:58.156 --> 00:42:00.564
through tumors,
through strokes,

00:42:00.564 --> 00:42:03.229
through injury.
For the most part,

00:42:03.229 --> 00:42:06.070
neuropsychologists don't like
helmet laws.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.259
Neuropsychologists love when
motorcyclists drive without

00:42:09.259 --> 00:42:12.796
helmets because through their
horrible accidents we gain great

00:42:12.796 --> 00:42:15.000
insights into how the brain
works.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.064
And the logic is if you find
somebody--Crudely,

00:42:18.064 --> 00:42:21.862
if you find somebody with
damage to this part of the brain

00:42:21.862 --> 00:42:26.260
right here and that person can't
recognize faces for instance,

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.713
there's some reason to believe
that this part of the brain is

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:33.815
related to face recognition.
And so, from the study of brain

00:42:33.815 --> 00:42:38.567
damage and the study of--we can
gain some understanding of what

00:42:38.567 --> 00:42:43.554
different parts of the brain do.
And so, people study brain

00:42:43.554 --> 00:42:48.695
damages--brain damage that
implicates motor control such as

00:42:48.695 --> 00:42:51.416
apraxia.
And what's interesting about

00:42:51.416 --> 00:42:55.239
apraxia is it's not paralysis.
Somebody with apraxia can move,

00:42:55.239 --> 00:42:58.897
do simple movements just fine
but they can't coordinate their

00:42:58.897 --> 00:43:01.481
movements.
They can't do something like

00:43:01.481 --> 00:43:03.719
wave goodbye or light a
cigarette.

00:43:03.719 --> 00:43:07.500
There is agnosia and agnosia is
a disorder which isn't blindness

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.619
because the person could still
see perfectly well.

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:15.485
Their eyes are intact but
rather what happens in agnosia

00:43:15.485 --> 00:43:20.349
is they lose the ability to
recognize certain things.

00:43:20.349 --> 00:43:23.420
Sometimes this is described as
psychic blindness.

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.989
And so, they may get visual
agnosia and lose the ability to

00:43:26.989 --> 00:43:30.852
recognize objects.
They may get prosopagnosia and

00:43:30.852 --> 00:43:34.099
lose the ability to recognize
faces.

00:43:34.099 --> 00:43:39.280
There are disorders of sensory
neglect, some famous disorders.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.947
Again, it's not paralysis,
it's not blindness,

00:43:41.947 --> 00:43:45.327
but due to certain parts of
your--of damaged parts of your

00:43:45.327 --> 00:43:46.972
brain,
you might lose,

00:43:46.972 --> 00:43:49.850
for instance,
the idea that there's a left

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:53.289
side of your body or a left side
of the world.

00:43:53.289 --> 00:43:56.003
And these cases are so
interesting I want to devote

00:43:56.003 --> 00:43:59.041
some chunk to a class in the
next few weeks to discussing

00:43:59.041 --> 00:44:02.533
them.
There are disorders of language

00:44:02.533 --> 00:44:06.605
like aphasia.
The classic case was discovered

00:44:06.605 --> 00:44:10.974
by Paul Broca in 1861.
A patient who had damage to

00:44:10.974 --> 00:44:14.725
part of his brain and can only
say one word,

00:44:14.725 --> 00:44:17.919
"tan,"
and the person would say,

00:44:17.919 --> 00:44:22.159
"tan, tan, tan,
tan," and everything else was

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.597
gone.
There's other disorders of

00:44:24.597 --> 00:44:28.188
language such as receptive
aphasia where the person could

00:44:28.188 --> 00:44:31.844
speak very fluently but the
words don't make any sense and

00:44:31.844 --> 00:44:34.409
they can't understand anybody
else.

00:44:34.409 --> 00:44:37.309
Other disorders that we'll
discuss later on include

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:40.210
acquired psychopathy,
where damage to parts of your

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.932
brain,
particularly related to the

00:44:42.932 --> 00:44:46.423
frontal lobes,
rob you of the ability to tell

00:44:46.423 --> 00:44:49.832
right from wrong.
The final--I want to end--We're

00:44:49.832 --> 00:44:52.829
talking about neurons,
connection between neurons,

00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:55.248
how neurons are wired up,
the parts of the brain,

00:44:55.248 --> 00:44:58.873
what the different parts do.
I want to end by talking about

00:44:58.873 --> 00:45:02.255
the two halves of the brain and
ask the question,

00:45:02.255 --> 00:45:05.999
"How many minds do you have?"
Now, if you look at the

00:45:05.999 --> 00:45:09.043
brain--If you took the brain out
and held it up,

00:45:09.043 --> 00:45:12.347
it would look pretty
symmetrical, but it actually is

00:45:12.347 --> 00:45:14.821
not.
There are actual differences

00:45:14.821 --> 00:45:18.469
between the right hemisphere and
the left hemisphere.

00:45:18.469 --> 00:45:23.969
How many people here are
right-handed?

00:45:23.969 --> 00:45:28.369
How many people here are
left-handed?

00:45:28.369 --> 00:45:31.461
How many people here are sort
of complicated,

00:45:31.461 --> 00:45:34.483
ambidextrous,
don't know, "bit of the right,

00:45:34.483 --> 00:45:36.880
bit of left" people?
Okay.

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.553
Those of you who are
right-handed,

00:45:39.553 --> 00:45:43.117
which comprises about nine out
of ten people,

00:45:43.117 --> 00:45:46.519
have language in your left
hemisphere.

00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:48.758
And, in fact,
we're going to be talking about

00:45:48.758 --> 00:45:51.964
right-handed people for the most
part, making generalizations in

00:45:51.964 --> 00:45:54.836
what I'll talk about now.
Those of you who are

00:45:54.836 --> 00:45:57.210
left-handed are more
complicated.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:59.816
Some of you have language in
your right hemisphere,

00:45:59.816 --> 00:46:02.580
some in your left hemisphere,
some God knows where.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.992
It's complicated.
Now, the idea is that some

00:46:05.992 --> 00:46:09.709
things are duplicated.
So, if you were to lose half

00:46:09.709 --> 00:46:13.089
your brain, the other half can
actually do a lot but some

00:46:13.089 --> 00:46:16.770
things are more prevalent and
more powerful in one part of the

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.844
brain than the other.
And I want to show you a brief

00:46:19.844 --> 00:46:22.653
film clip from "Scientific
American" that illustrates the

00:46:22.653 --> 00:46:24.610
differences between the
hemispheres,

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:27.412
but before doing that,
I want to provide some

00:46:27.412 --> 00:46:30.909
introductory facts.
Some functions are lateralized.

00:46:30.909 --> 00:46:32.519
So, typically,
language in the left.

00:46:32.519 --> 00:46:36.207
Again, this is a right-handed
centric thing but if you're

00:46:36.207 --> 00:46:40.091
right-handed – language on the
left, math and music on the

00:46:40.091 --> 00:46:42.302
right.
There is a crossover and this

00:46:42.302 --> 00:46:45.727
is important when we think about
the studies that will follow but

00:46:45.727 --> 00:46:49.152
the crossover is that everything
you see in the left visual field

00:46:49.152 --> 00:46:51.400
goes to the right side of your
brain;

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:54.877
everything in the right visual
field goes to the left side of

00:46:54.877 --> 00:46:58.239
the brain, and similarly,
there's a crossover in action.

00:46:58.239 --> 00:47:00.293
So, your right hemisphere
controls the left side of the

00:47:00.293 --> 00:47:02.274
body.
Your left hemisphere controls

00:47:02.274 --> 00:47:05.574
the right side of the body.
Now, finally,

00:47:05.574 --> 00:47:12.907
the two halves are connected.
They're connected by this huge

00:47:12.907 --> 00:47:19.055
web called the corpus callosum.
And I'm just going to skip this

00:47:19.055 --> 00:47:23.730
because the movie illustration
will go through some of this.

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:30.506
This illustrates certain themes
that are discussed in detail in

00:47:30.506 --> 00:47:33.725
the Gray book,
concerning the lateralization

00:47:33.725 --> 00:47:37.570
of different parts of different
mental capacities,

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:39.969
some in the left hemisphere,
some in the right hemisphere.

00:47:39.969 --> 00:47:45.183
But it also serves as a useful
methodological development,

00:47:45.183 --> 00:47:50.946
which is a nice illustration as
to how looking at people who are

00:47:50.946 --> 00:47:54.641
incredibly unusual,
such as this man who had his

00:47:54.641 --> 00:47:57.483
brain bisected so his left
hemisphere and his right

00:47:57.483 --> 00:48:00.893
hemisphere don't communicate
with one another--how looking at

00:48:00.893 --> 00:48:03.231
such people,
such extreme cases,

00:48:03.231 --> 00:48:07.271
can provide us with some
understanding of how we normally

00:48:07.271 --> 00:48:09.225
do things.
And this, again,

00:48:09.225 --> 00:48:12.400
is a theme we'll return to
throughout the course.

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.632
This is generally the general
introduction of the brain that I

00:48:16.632 --> 00:48:19.631
wanted to provide,
giving the framework for what

00:48:19.631 --> 00:48:23.020
I'll be talking about later on
throughout the course so that I

00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.520
might later on make reference to
neurons or neurotransmitters or

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.354
the cortex or the left
hemisphere and you'll sort of

00:48:29.354 --> 00:48:32.076
have the background to
understand what I'm talking

00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:35.917
about.
But I want to end this first

00:48:35.917 --> 00:48:40.535
real class with a bit of
humility as to what

00:48:40.535 --> 00:48:44.510
psychologists know and don't
know.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:47.396
So, the idea behind a lot of
psychology – particularly a

00:48:47.396 --> 00:48:50.080
lot of neuroscience and
cognitive psychology – is to

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:52.460
treat the mind as an information
processor,

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:57.498
as an elaborate computer.
And so, we study different

00:48:57.498 --> 00:49:03.097
problems like recognizing faces
or language or motor control or

00:49:03.097 --> 00:49:06.096
logic.
The strategy then often is to

00:49:06.096 --> 00:49:09.488
figure out how,
what sort of program can solve

00:49:09.488 --> 00:49:12.730
these problems and then we go on
to ask,

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:18.207
"How could this program be
instantiated in the physical

00:49:18.207 --> 00:49:21.054
brain?"
So, we would solve--We study

00:49:21.054 --> 00:49:25.131
people much as we'd study a
computer from an alien planet or

00:49:25.131 --> 00:49:28.229
something.
And I think--This strategy is

00:49:28.229 --> 00:49:32.857
one I'm very enthusiastic about
but there still remains what's

00:49:32.857 --> 00:49:37.029
sometimes called the "hard
problem" of consciousness and

00:49:37.029 --> 00:49:40.140
this involves subjective
experience.

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:46.409
What's it like?
So, my computer can play chess.

00:49:46.409 --> 00:49:50.030
My computer can recognize
numbers.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:53.493
It can do math.
And maybe it does it kind of

00:49:53.493 --> 00:49:58.174
the same way that I do it but my
computer doesn't have feelings

00:49:58.174 --> 00:50:01.655
in the same sense.
These are two classic

00:50:01.655 --> 00:50:04.380
illustrations.
This is from a very old "Star

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.750
Trek" episode.
It illustrates angst.

00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:09.590
I think a starship's about to
go into the sun or something.

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:14.659
And that's my older kid,
Max, who's happy.

00:50:14.659 --> 00:50:18.018
And so the question is,
"How does a thing like that

00:50:18.018 --> 00:50:21.780
give rise to consciousness and
subjective experience?"

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:25.272
And this is a deep puzzle.
And although some psychologists

00:50:25.272 --> 00:50:29.015
and philosophers think they've
solved it, most of us are a lot

00:50:29.015 --> 00:50:32.242
more skeptical.
Most of us think we have so far

00:50:32.242 --> 00:50:35.598
to go before we can answer
questions like Huxley's

00:50:35.598 --> 00:50:37.433
question.
Huxley points out,

00:50:37.433 --> 00:50:40.306
"How it is that anything so
remarkable as a state of

00:50:40.306 --> 00:50:43.574
consciousness comes about as a
result of irritating nervous

00:50:43.574 --> 00:50:45.868
tissue,
is just as unaccountable as the

00:50:45.868 --> 00:50:48.792
appearance of the Djinn…" –
of the genie – "…when

00:50:48.792 --> 00:50:52.151
Aladdin rubs his lamp."
It seems like magic that a

00:50:52.151 --> 00:50:55.923
fleshy lump of gray,
disgusting meat can give rise

00:50:55.923 --> 00:50:59.057
to these feelings.
The second bit of humility

00:50:59.057 --> 00:51:01.742
we'll end the class on is I am
presenting here,

00:51:01.742 --> 00:51:04.719
and I'll be presenting
throughout this semester,

00:51:04.719 --> 00:51:08.380
what you can call a mechanistic
conception of mental life.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.391
I'm not going to be talking
about how beautiful it is and

00:51:10.391 --> 00:51:12.079
how wonderful it is and how
mysterious it is.

00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:14.429
Rather, I'm going to be trying
to explain it.

00:51:14.429 --> 00:51:17.654
I'm going to be trying to
explain fundamental aspects of

00:51:17.654 --> 00:51:21.289
ourselves including questions
like how do we make decisions,

00:51:21.289 --> 00:51:25.164
why do we love our children,
what happens when we fall in

00:51:25.164 --> 00:51:29.403
love, and so on.
Now, you might find this sort

00:51:29.403 --> 00:51:33.429
of project in the end to be
repellant.

00:51:33.429 --> 00:51:38.407
You might worry about how this,
well, this meshes with humanist

00:51:38.407 --> 00:51:39.905
values.
For instance,

00:51:39.905 --> 00:51:43.486
when we deal with one another
in a legal and a moral setting,

00:51:43.486 --> 00:51:46.650
we think in terms of free will
and responsibility.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:50.540
If we're driving and you cut me
off, you chose to do that.

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:54.551
It reflects badly on you.
If you save a life at risk to

00:51:54.551 --> 00:51:56.860
your own, you're--you deserve
praise.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:01.561
You did something wonderful.
It might be hard to mesh this

00:52:01.561 --> 00:52:04.845
with the conception in which all
actions are the result of

00:52:04.845 --> 00:52:06.920
neurochemical physical
processes.

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.853
It might also be hard to mesh a
notion such as the purported

00:52:10.853 --> 00:52:13.612
intrinsic value of people.
And finally,

00:52:13.612 --> 00:52:17.929
it might be hard to mesh the
mechanistic notion of the mind

00:52:17.929 --> 00:52:21.650
with the idea that people have
spiritual value.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:25.380
Faced with this tension,
there are three possibilities.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:28.512
You might choose to reject the
scientific conception of the

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.579
mind.
Many people do.

00:52:30.579 --> 00:52:33.801
You may choose to embrace
dualism, reject the idea that

00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:37.083
the brain is responsible for
mental life, and reject the

00:52:37.083 --> 00:52:39.409
promise of a scientific
psychology.

00:52:39.409 --> 00:52:42.452
Alternatively,
you might choose to embrace the

00:52:42.452 --> 00:52:46.510
scientific worldview and reject
all these humanist values.

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.912
And there are some philosophers
and psychologists who do just

00:52:49.912 --> 00:52:53.428
that, who claim that free will
and responsibility and spiritual

00:52:53.428 --> 00:52:56.150
value and intrinsic value are
all illusions;

00:52:56.150 --> 00:53:00.635
they're pre-scientific notions
that get washed away in modern

00:53:00.635 --> 00:53:04.000
science or you could try to
reconcile them.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.296
You could try to figure out how
to mesh your scientific view of

00:53:08.296 --> 00:53:11.899
the mind with these humanist
values you might want to

00:53:11.899 --> 00:53:13.857
preserve.
And this is an issue which

00:53:13.857 --> 00:53:15.810
we're going to return to
throughout the course.

00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.000
Okay.
I'll see you on Wednesday.

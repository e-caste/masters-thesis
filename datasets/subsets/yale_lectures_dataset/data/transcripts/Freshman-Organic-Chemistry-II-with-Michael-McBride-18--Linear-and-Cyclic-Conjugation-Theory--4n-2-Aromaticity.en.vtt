00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.733
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK, so last
time we started talking about 

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:08.233
conjugation, the special
properties that functional 

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:10.767
groups have when they're
adjacent to one another, in 

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:13.467
particular dienes. 

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:17.567
We talked last time about the
allyl system. 

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.900
The question is, when does
conjugation make a difference? 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.067
That is, when is it simple
enough and accurate enough to 

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:27.933
think in terms of isolated
functional groups with 

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.267
pairwise atom interactions? 

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:34.433
So we started last time with
giving experimental evidence 

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:38.500
that allyl cation, anion, and
radical are all stabilized by 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.633
something in the order 13
kilocalories per mole. 

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:44.200
And in fact the transition
states when they're allylic, 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.133
are also stabilized. 

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:50.000
And then right at the end last
time you guessed for me, 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.567
and did the right thing, to show
that the diene at the 

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:56.467
bottom is special because it's
conjugated, as opposed to the 

00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:57.833
other dienes. 

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:02.333
So the heat that's involved in
removing the double bonds is 

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:05.200
less, because it started out
more stable. 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.633
But here conjugation is worth
only about 4 kilocalories per 

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:13.100
mole evidently, compared to 13
kilocalories in allylic 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.400
situations. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.067
Another way of measuring it is
to look at how difficult it is 

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:21.333
to rotate about the single bond
between the two double 

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.167
bonds in butadiene. 

00:01:23.167 --> 00:01:26.467
So for confirmations we can have
syn, sort of like 

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:29.267
eclipsed, and anti. 

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:31.900
And in between those there's a
twisted form where the two 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.567
ends are perpendicular to one
another, and of course there's 

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:38.067
then no overlap across the
middle. 

00:01:38.067 --> 00:01:42.733
The two pi systems on the ends
are orthogonal. 

00:01:42.733 --> 00:01:45.533
So you might expect that to the
extent the conjugation is 

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.667
worth something, the interaction
of these pi 

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:51.100
things, you'd lose it in this
twisted form, because they 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.300
don't overlap. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.233
So you might expect that the
energy curve would look like 

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:57.367
that as we twist it. 

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:00.233
In fact it's more or less like
that, but there's another 

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:03.167
factor, which is up at the top
left there, you can see 

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:06.867
there's going to be repulsion
between the groups when 

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:09.167
they're syn, so that's going to
raise the 

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.767
left end of this plot. 

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.233
So that's what it actually looks
like, as determined by 

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.467
Raman spectroscopy. 

00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:20.933
So the important thing is to
look at the how big the 

00:02:20.933 --> 00:02:22.067
barrier is. 

00:02:22.067 --> 00:02:25.200
You can see the barrier is about
6 kilocalories per mole 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.700
in this case, versus about 60
kilocalories per mole for 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.700
twisting the interaction between
two p 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.567
orbitals across a single-- 

00:02:33.567 --> 00:02:36.967
across a normal double bond, an
isolated double bond. 

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:40.700
So the one between the two
double bonds is 10 times 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.067
easier to rotate than the one
that's involved in a genuine 

00:02:45.067 --> 00:02:46.100
double bond. 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.467
Even though, when you look at
it, there are just four p 

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:49.833
orbitals in a row. 

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:52.800
It's not immediately obvious
that there's anything special 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.200
about the one in the middle that
would make it easier to 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.733
rotate than the ones at the
ends, which we know 

00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:01.167
would be hard to rotate. 

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:05.400
So why is conjugation worth more
in allylic intermediates, 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.267
on the order of 13 kilocalories
per mole than it 

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:12.300
is in, where it's only a
handful, three to six 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.367
kilocalories per mole? 

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:17.333
Well, one would be tempted to
say it's because we can draw 

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:20.167
reasonable resonance structures
in the case of an 

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:21.600
allylic intermediate. 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.333
Those two at the top there are
good. 

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:25.800
They're equivalent to one
another. 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.633
The one at the bottom is bad,
because we 

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.400
have to separate charge. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.433
But that's not really a physical
theory, as we know; 

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:38.000
the resonance theory. It's a
very handy thing to remind us of

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.600
what really happens, but it's
not what really happens. 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.467
We have to look at how the
orbitals 

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:45.200
interact with one another. 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.233
So we're going to now, having
looked at some experimental 

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:52.467
evidence for the extent of
stabilization due to 

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:57.767
conjugation, we're going to look
at the theory behind it. 

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:02.433
And we're going to work in terms
of simple Hueckel MOs. 

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:06.100
The PowerPoint chooses that
particular 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.867
color to give links. 

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:14.500
If you link there, you can get a
simple-minded program to run 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.833
on your computer that'll let you
make simple Hueckel MOs. 

00:04:18.833 --> 00:04:22.733
So Erich Hueckel was a
physicist, a theorist, and not 

00:04:22.733 --> 00:04:26.133
long after Schroedinger
developed quantum mechanics, 

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:29.433
he began to apply it to some
organic-type molecules. 

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:31.600
In particular, the interaction
of p" 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.333
orbitals with one another. 

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:35.467
His brother was an organic
chemist" 

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:38.967
wrote a very influential text
book of advanced organic 

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:41.833
chemistry, and no doubt
influenced him some in this 

00:04:41.833 --> 00:04:43.467
interest. 

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:45.967
But it's a very simple-minded
theory, as you might have 

00:04:45.967 --> 00:04:53.267
expected from being so soon
after Schroedinger developed 

00:04:53.267 --> 00:04:55.600
wave mechanics. 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.233
But anyhow, these results are
due to that, and I don't think 

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.600
it's appropriate to take the
time to go into the 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.467
limitations of the theory. 

00:05:04.467 --> 00:05:08.167
But let's just take it as
qualitative guide to the way 

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:10.733
things work in quantum
mechanics. 

00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:12.900
OK, suppose we have four p"
orbitals in a row. 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.600
There's the energy of an
isolated p" orbital. 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.600
Now there are two ways to look
at butadiene. 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.367
You can look at it as a whole,
or you can look at it as two 

00:05:22.367 --> 00:05:26.167
double bonds, and see how they
interact with one another. 

00:05:26.167 --> 00:05:28.467
Let's compare those two ways of
doing it. 

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:30.267
So first let's look at it as a
whole. 

00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:33.533
You take those four p orbitals"
in a row, and you combine them 

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:38.000
to make the best possible
molecular orbital, Si1, then 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.400
the next best, then the next
best, them the next best. So 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.467
that's what they look like. 

00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:45.833
And they have what you would
anticipate in 

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:47.167
terms of nodal structure. 

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:49.267
The lowest one has no nodes,
except the 

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:50.700
node of the p orbital". 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.267
The next one has one node, two
nodes, three nodes. 

00:05:54.267 --> 00:05:57.367
But there's a little bit more to
it than that. 

00:05:57.367 --> 00:06:01.000
You notice that the best one is
big in the middle. 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.200
Why are the p orbitals" big in
the middle rather than all of 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.267
them being the same size to get
the best overall overlap? 

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:15.633
Elisa, what do you say? 

00:06:15.633 --> 00:06:16.467
STUDENT: The middle ones have
two overlaps. 

00:06:16.467 --> 00:06:19.433
PROFESSOR: Right, the ones in
the middle have two overlaps. 

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:23.067
And in fact, you can write a
simple equation that will 

00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:26.167
maximize the product of adjacent
orbitals, that is 

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:30.200
the overlap, subject to the sum
of their squares being one, 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.433
and you get that shape. 

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:33.033
Right? 

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:36.067
So to maximize the bonding-
orbital overlap, the central 

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:40.600
atomic orbitals are large in Si1
and for the same reason 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.467
they're small in Si2. 

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:43.733
Why should they be small? 

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:44.700
STUDENT: You don't have much
opposing overlap. 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:51.433
PROFESSOR: Right, because the
overlap in the middle is 

00:06:51.433 --> 00:06:53.933
hurting you now, so make it
small. 

00:06:53.933 --> 00:06:56.067
Get the overlap on the ends. 

00:06:56.067 --> 00:06:56.900
OK. 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.300
Notice incidentally, the three
and four turn out; they're not 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.667
as good as they could possibly
be, but as bad as they could 

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:05.800
possibly be. 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.133
Here the one that's in the
middle where it's 

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:09.433
favorable is small. 

00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:12.500
Here the one where it's
unfavorable is large. 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.733
That turns out to be the flip
side of -- 

00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:18.433
Do people know what flip side
is? 

00:07:18.433 --> 00:07:20.900
It occurs to me that that's
something that people might 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.267
not know anymore. 

00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:26.600
When you had vinyl records,
you'd buy a song that would 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.000
be, and there would be some
other song on the back that 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.867
wasn't very good, right? 

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.300
So you'd play the side of the
record that was the real one, 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.967
then you have the flip side,
which wasn't so great. 

00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:39.533
So the flip side of having these
be as good as possible, 

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:42.433
is those have to be as bad as
possible, the bonding and the 

00:07:42.433 --> 00:07:44.267
antibonding ones. 

00:07:44.267 --> 00:07:46.967
OK anyhow, there's a little
cultural history for you. 

00:07:46.967 --> 00:07:51.467
So we have four p" electrons,
and they go into those two 

00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:53.267
orbitals and get stabilized. 

00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:56.567
And that's the energy then, the
pi energy of the 

00:07:56.567 --> 00:07:59.967
butadiene, four p orbitals" in a
row. 

00:07:59.967 --> 00:08:01.733
Now let's look at it the other
way. 

00:08:01.733 --> 00:08:05.367
Let's see if we just look at
localized pi-bonds on each 

00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:08.400
end, how different it is. 

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.400
So we get two pi-orbitals, one
on each end, two pi stars, one 

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.467
on each end, and the four
electrons go down into the two 

00:08:16.467 --> 00:08:18.333
pi-orbitals. 

00:08:18.333 --> 00:08:21.267
And what we want to do is see
how that compares with the 

00:08:21.267 --> 00:08:23.667
delocalized orbitals on the
left. 

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:26.267
How different are they in
overall stability? 

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:27.833
Well, let's analyze it this way.

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:29.800
We know that in fact we could
mix these 

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.667
two with one another. 

00:08:30.667 --> 00:08:34.167
This is pi + pi and pi - pi. 

00:08:34.167 --> 00:08:36.533
So we're getting things that
look a little bit like this, 

00:08:36.533 --> 00:08:40.967
but they're not distorted to
optimize the overlap. 

00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:43.200
And if we-- 

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.033
this goes down, and this goes up
the same amount. 

00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:49.633
You know in truth the one that
goes up goes up a little 

00:08:49.633 --> 00:08:51.833
more than the one that goes down
goes down. 

00:08:51.833 --> 00:08:54.200
But that's part of the Hueckel
approximation, is that they go 

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.900
up and down the same amount. 

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.467
So the average is the same as
where it started, but it's a 

00:09:01.467 --> 00:09:04.333
little worse than it was on the
left when 

00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:06.367
we optimized things. 

00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:10.200
Now you can optimize things on
the right too, and see why 

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.500
it's not very important to do
this change in size. 

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.000
So here are the pi * orbitals
that we got just by 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.633
adding the two ends. 

00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:22.833
But now we can mix among these.

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:27.033
So look what happens if we mix
this one, the two nodes, with 

00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.800
the no nodes. 

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.933
We can make it so it reinforces
in the middle and 

00:09:31.933 --> 00:09:36.167
cancels on the end, and get a
thing that looks like that. 

00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:39.400
And that will make it a little
bit lower in energy to do 

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.533
that, to mix this one with this
one. 

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:45.433
We started with just isolated p
orbitals, and now we're 

00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:48.633
letting them interact with one
another, to see how much 

00:09:48.633 --> 00:09:49.867
difference it makes. 

00:09:49.867 --> 00:09:52.533
But this secondary mixing -- 

00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:56.400
the first mixing was making
these from here -- 

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.900
the secondary mixing is minor,
because the 

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.833
energy match is so bad. 

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:03.567
You don't mix very much of this
into this one to get 

00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:08.867
that, or of this into this one
to get that. 

00:10:08.867 --> 00:10:12.267
At the same time, this one can
mix with this one, and that 

00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:14.067
one will go down just a little
bit. 

00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:17.767
But notice that the amount by
which they went down is very 

00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:22.567
small, because of the bad energy
match. 

00:10:22.567 --> 00:10:25.700
But then the ones on the far
right are the same as the ones 

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.667
on the left, if we let these
interact with one another in 

00:10:29.667 --> 00:10:30.967
two stages. 

00:10:30.967 --> 00:10:34.200
But that second stage, the one
that made it big in the middle 

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.567
and small on the ends here,
didn't 

00:10:36.567 --> 00:10:38.667
account for much energy. 

00:10:38.667 --> 00:10:41.400
Because the energy match was so
bad, of the 

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.700
things we were mixing. 

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.867
And the same here. 

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:49.200
Now you might say, that it's
only about three kilocalories 

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.000
per mole, max. 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.933
That's only the barrier to
rotation of ethane; 

00:10:52.933 --> 00:10:56.467
it's not very much. 

00:10:56.467 --> 00:10:58.567
Now why did we ignore this
mixing? 

00:10:58.567 --> 00:11:01.467
Because there the energy match
is pretty good. 

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:03.800
Can anybody see why we didn't
consider that mixing? 

00:11:06.367 --> 00:11:07.600
There it might have been more
important. 

00:11:13.467 --> 00:11:16.467
What's the overlap of this with
this? 

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:21.700
Notice that despite the better
energy match, it doesn't lower 

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.500
the energy, because these are
orthogonal to one another. 

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.900
They won't mix. 

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:31.267
What is gained at two of the
positions, is lost at the 

00:11:31.267 --> 00:11:32.167
other positions. 

00:11:32.167 --> 00:11:34.967
That is, if you adjusted on the
left to be big in the 

00:11:34.967 --> 00:11:37.200
middle and small on the outside,
on the right it'll be 

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.067
just the opposite. 

00:11:38.067 --> 00:11:41.067
So you won't gain anything. 

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:44.767
So you consider only this one
mixing with that one, this one 

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:46.767
mixing with that one, and it
doesn't count for much. 

00:11:46.767 --> 00:11:50.833
That's why you don't get much
out of a diene. 

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:53.233
So, although the total energies
are nearly the same, 

00:11:53.233 --> 00:11:55.233
with and without conjugation. 

00:11:55.233 --> 00:11:58.633
That is, the total energy that
we calculate here is almost 

00:11:58.633 --> 00:12:00.833
the same as the total energy we
calculate there. 

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:04.200
There's just that few
kilocalories difference. 

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.067
But the energy of the HOMO and
the energy of the LUMO are 

00:12:08.067 --> 00:12:10.633
quite different here from what
they are here. 

00:12:10.633 --> 00:12:14.167
So if you're interested in
reactivity, then the 

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.800
conjugation makes a difference.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.867
If you're interested actually,
not in the total energy, but 

00:12:19.867 --> 00:12:23.700
the energy of the HOMO and the
energy of the LUMO, and also 

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.367
if you're interested in color. 

00:12:26.367 --> 00:12:28.600
Because if you want to take one
of these electrons with 

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:31.700
light and put it up into the
antibonding orbital, it's a 

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.933
much bigger jump here, when it's
not conjugated, than here, 

00:12:34.933 --> 00:12:35.967
when it's conjugated. 

00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:38.167
So you get a very different
color. 

00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:39.900
And we'll talk about that later.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.000
For example carotene, the stuff
that makes carrots 

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.233
orange, is a bunch of double
bonds in a row. 

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:53.267
So we see that when we mix
these, they go up and down. 

00:12:53.267 --> 00:12:54.133
Is there a limit? 

00:12:54.133 --> 00:12:57.467
If we put a whole bunch of these
pi" orbitals in a row, as 

00:12:57.467 --> 00:13:01.733
in carotene or something even
longer than that? 

00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:04.333
Do we just keep getting lower,
and lower, and lower, and 

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:06.767
lower energies for the lowest
energy? 

00:13:06.767 --> 00:13:09.500
So let's consider a few of these
and just think about it 

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.633
sort of approximately
quantitatively. 

00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:16.567
So there the chain length is two
for ethylene. 

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:20.067
And the normalized atomic
orbital size is 1 over the 

00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:21.233
square root of 2. 

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:25.100
So when we square and sum, we
get 1. 

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:31.000
So the overlap, when you have
this 1pi bond, is 1/2. 

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.633
It's 1 over the square root of 2
here, 1 over the 

00:13:33.633 --> 00:13:35.100
square root of 2 here. 

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.100
Multiply them together to see
how much they overlap. 

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:44.067
And you get 1/2 in some units. 

00:13:44.067 --> 00:13:48.333
Notice we're ignoring the
smallish influence of 

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:50.233
overlap on normalization. 

00:13:50.233 --> 00:13:52.300
Because remember when we take
overlap into account, we have 

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.067
to make them a little bit
smaller-- 

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:56.000
less than one, greater than one,
kind of thing. 

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.300
We're ignoring that, just to get
an idea of 

00:13:58.300 --> 00:13:59.900
what's going on. 

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:01.967
OK, so the overlap is 1/2. 

00:14:01.967 --> 00:14:05.500
There's only one pi bond in that
case, so we 

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.400
get 1/2 times one. 

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.000
The total overlap stabilization
is 1/2 in these 

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.767
sort of weird units. 

00:14:12.767 --> 00:14:16.000
And notice that if you compare
this with a textbook, you'll 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.833
see that they use a unit called
beta which turns out to be 

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:22.233
half as big as this unit is. 

00:14:22.233 --> 00:14:25.767
But anyhow, I think it's easy to
go through it this way. 

00:14:25.767 --> 00:14:28.033
Now suppose we have four in a
row. 

00:14:28.033 --> 00:14:30.400
Now the chain length is 4. 

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.500
The normalize size is 1 over the
square root of 4. 

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.767
So that you could square and sum
them up and get 1. 

00:14:36.767 --> 00:14:40.333
And now the overlap between each
pair of neighbors is 1 

00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:42.400
over the square root of 4 times
1 over the square root 

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.867
of 4, so it's 1/4. 

00:14:46.867 --> 00:14:49.233
And there are three such bond
interactions, 

00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:53.300
here, here, here. So there are 3
times 1/4, or 3/4. 

00:14:53.300 --> 00:15:00.333
So indeed it's more stable, that
lowest-energy orbital, 

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:03.167
the one that's approximated like
this. 

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:05.500
Now suppose we have eight in a
row. 

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.000
Now the normalized atomic
orbital size is 1 over the 

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.500
square root of 8. 

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.333
1/8 is the overlap per bond, and
there are seven 

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:16.667
bonds, so we get 7/8 as the
amount of stabilization. 

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:18.400
So it's going down, down, down,
down. 

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:22.667
And obviously each time we add a
pair, it's going to go down 

00:15:22.667 --> 00:15:24.767
more and more. 

00:15:24.767 --> 00:15:26.000
Is there a limit? 

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.267
Does it just keep going? 

00:15:34.267 --> 00:15:36.167
Obviously it'll get a little bit
better, a little bit 

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:38.667
better, but does it approach a
limit? 

00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:41.200
Can you see what it would be if
N were infinite? 

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.200
If the number of the chain
lengths were infinite? 

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:43.567
Yeah. 

00:15:43.567 --> 00:15:44.967
STUDENT: It approaches one. 

00:15:44.967 --> 00:15:48.067
PROFESSOR: It approaches one,
right? 

00:15:48.067 --> 00:15:51.000
Because if you have N, it's 1
over the square root of N. 

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.367
And there, 1/N is the overlap,
and there are N- 

00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:57.667
1 of these pairs, right? 

00:15:57.667 --> 00:16:00.967
So it's (N-1)/N, which
approaches one as N gets 

00:16:00.967 --> 00:16:02.000
very large. 

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.233
So there's a limit to how good
it can get. 

00:16:05.233 --> 00:16:09.633
And incidentally, that limit is
twice what it started out 

00:16:09.633 --> 00:16:11.033
here, here, right? 

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:13.367
It was 1/2, and it approaches 1.

00:16:13.367 --> 00:16:15.567
And incidentally we also get bad

00:16:15.567 --> 00:16:19.067
combinations, the anti-bond. 

00:16:19.067 --> 00:16:21.400
But it's exactly the opposite of
this. 

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:27.000
So the worst antibonding
combination is, the 

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.967
destabilization is twice that of
pi" star. 

00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:32.400
So these approach a limit. 

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.867
And that suggests, although it
doesn't prove, this 

00:16:35.867 --> 00:16:39.300
construction that allows you to
view what the energies of 

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.667
the orbital will be in this
simple approximation for any 

00:16:43.667 --> 00:16:44.900
length of chain. 

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.667
So you draw a semicircle. 

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:48.900
The vertical axis is the energy.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.500
Zero is a p orbital". 

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.067
Here's plus 1, minus 1. 

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:54.733
Those are the limits if you have
a very long chain. 

00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:57.967
But it turns out there's this
geometrical analogy. 

00:16:57.967 --> 00:17:01.833
That if what you do is draw this
circle, whose radius is 

00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:07.833
twice the stabilization of the
two p orbitals" in the pi" bond,

00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:10.067
and has that limit. 

00:17:10.067 --> 00:17:13.933
And then you put points along
this circle, along the 

00:17:13.933 --> 00:17:20.533
circumference, evenly spaced
along the circumference, it 

00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:23.767
turns out that the height of the
intersections, of those 

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:28.533
points, is the energy of the
various orbitals you can have. 

00:17:28.533 --> 00:17:31.400
So if you have just one p
orbital", you put it here, 

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.267
equidistant between top and
bottom. 

00:17:33.267 --> 00:17:35.667
And it has the energy 0. 

00:17:35.667 --> 00:17:38.867
So that's the energy of an
isolated p orbital". 

00:17:38.867 --> 00:17:41.033
That was definition, actually. 

00:17:41.033 --> 00:17:44.900
OK now we take ethylene, so we
put two evenly spaced points 

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.833
along here, to divide it into
three along the circumference. 

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:52.333
And now we can put into
electronics in ethylene. 

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:55.833
And that's the energy they'll
have in a pi"-orbital. 

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:58.133
It's 1/2, halfway down here. 

00:18:01.267 --> 00:18:03.400
And now we take N equals 3. 

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.700
That's the allyl system. 

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.533
Put three equally spaced dots. 

00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:11.333
And there are the energies in
the allyl radical. 

00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:14.400
Two of the three p orbitals", of
the electrons in the p 

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.900
orbitals", are in the lowest-
energy molecular orbital, and 

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.100
one is up here. 

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.733
Now, what's the stabilization? 

00:18:21.733 --> 00:18:23.900
Compared to what, right? 

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.767
Compared to what you had if you
had just the pi" bond and a 

00:18:27.767 --> 00:18:29.300
p" orbital, a radical. 

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.800
How much better is it to have
them next to one another and 

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.900
overlapping in an allyl system?

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.667
Well you can see that if you had
just the p orbital" and a 

00:18:36.667 --> 00:18:38.967
pi" bond, you'd have these
energies. 

00:18:38.967 --> 00:18:40.700
In the allyl, you have these
energies. 

00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:46.833
So that's the allylic
stabilization. 

00:18:46.833 --> 00:18:51.300
Notice the orbitals, the
electrons that got stabilized 

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.633
were the ones in the lowest
orbital. 

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:56.700
In the difference between having
them separate, and 

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.167
having them together. 

00:18:58.167 --> 00:19:01.467
And what that means is, that it
doesn't make any difference 

00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:03.800
whether you have the electron
there or not. 

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.433
If that electron is not there,
you have a cation. 

00:19:06.433 --> 00:19:09.533
If the electron is there, you
have a radical. 

00:19:09.533 --> 00:19:11.067
If there are two electrons
there, you 

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:13.300
have the allylic anion. 

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.133
But in each of those cases, the
amount of stabilization 

00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:18.400
you get is the same. 

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.933
So you got the same two-electron
stabilization 

00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:22.933
whether you have cation,
radical, or anion. 

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:30.800
And incidentally, when we look
at this one, remember that's 

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.433
just an isolated p orbital". 

00:19:32.433 --> 00:19:35.133
But in the allyl case it'll look
like this. 

00:19:35.133 --> 00:19:38.267
It's the one with one node. 

00:19:38.267 --> 00:19:40.900
Plus on one side, minus on the
other. 

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.667
But that's going to be generally
true, however long 

00:19:43.667 --> 00:19:45.533
the chain is. 

00:19:45.533 --> 00:19:48.000
If you have an odd number,
odd chain,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.867
here we had N equals 3,
but if you

00:19:49.867 --> 00:19:54.067
had N equals 5, you'd have blue,
nothing, 

00:19:54.067 --> 00:19:58.133
red, nothing, blue. 

00:19:58.133 --> 00:20:01.067
And notice that in this orbital,
there's no overlap 

00:20:01.067 --> 00:20:05.033
between occupied atomic
orbitals. 

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:06.600
They're far apart. 

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.067
So there's no interaction
between them. 

00:20:09.067 --> 00:20:11.800
Therefore their energy will be
the same as an isolated p 

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.333
orbital, in this crude
approximation. 

00:20:16.333 --> 00:20:22.300
So every odd chain is going to
have an orbital that has the 

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.933
same energy as an isolated p
orbital, that's going to have 

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:30.667
a node at every second carbon. 

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:34.733
Now suppose you have N equals 4.

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:38.267
Now you have these energies for
the four electrons, 

00:20:38.267 --> 00:20:42.800
compared to this that you'd have
if you had two p-orbitals. 

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.067
So the favorable orbital is
favored, compared to the 

00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:49.600
electrons in the pi" orbitals
when they were isolated. 

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.600
But this one is less stable. 

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.100
It's the one that's antibonding

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.467
in the middle, remember? 

00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:59.067
But this one, remember, was big
in the middle, and this 

00:20:59.067 --> 00:21:00.700
one we made small in the middle.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.867
So this one went down more than
this one went up, and the 

00:21:03.867 --> 00:21:07.367
difference is the resonance
stabilization. 

00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:08.867
But it's not as big. 

00:21:08.867 --> 00:21:12.267
The difference between these two
is not as big as how much 

00:21:12.267 --> 00:21:15.167
those lowest two got stabilized
in allyl. 

00:21:15.167 --> 00:21:18.500
So that's why conjugation is
worth more in these allylic 

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.067
intermediates, like 13
kilocalories per mole, than it 

00:21:22.067 --> 00:21:23.233
is in a diene. 

00:21:23.233 --> 00:21:25.767
Because in a diene some go up
and some go down. 

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.167
So as the conjugated chain
lengthens, more and more 

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:35.800
levels get crowded between minus
one-- 

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.833
here's the limit of the lowest
one. 

00:21:37.833 --> 00:21:38.967
There's the highest one. 

00:21:38.967 --> 00:21:40.800
And we're putting dots along
here. 

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.133
But as we put more and more,
longer and longer chain, we're 

00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:47.200
going to crowd more and more
energy levels between those 

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.333
two limits. 

00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:53.300
So that means the HOMO-LUMO gap
is going to decrease. 

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.167
So as we make it longer and
longer, you'll have this gap, 

00:21:56.167 --> 00:21:58.933
and then this gap, this gap,
this gap, this gap, this gap. 

00:21:58.933 --> 00:22:01.767
Why did I draw it like this? 

00:22:01.767 --> 00:22:03.033
Why did I use those colors? 

00:22:08.367 --> 00:22:11.867
Because as the energy gets
smaller, it absorbs longer and 

00:22:11.867 --> 00:22:13.867
longer wavelengths. 

00:22:13.867 --> 00:22:17.467
So you can tune the color of 

00:22:17.467 --> 00:22:19.200
a conjugated polyene-- 

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.533
by how long you make the chain.

00:22:20.533 --> 00:22:23.233
And we'll see examples of that
too. 

00:22:23.233 --> 00:22:25.967
It's a good thing to talk about
now, because very soon 

00:22:25.967 --> 00:22:29.367
the spring migrant birds will be
coming back to East Rock 

00:22:29.367 --> 00:22:31.567
Park in these beautiful tropical
colors they've 

00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:34.333
acquired, and most of them have
to do with that, as 

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:36.933
you'll see. 

00:22:36.933 --> 00:22:40.767
Now let's look at heats of
hydrogenation and conjugation. 

00:22:40.767 --> 00:22:43.467
So here's cyclohexane, and
here's cyclohexene. 

00:22:43.467 --> 00:22:47.767
The heat of hydrogenation, to
change this to that, is 28 

00:22:47.767 --> 00:22:48.967
kilocalories per mole. 

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:51.867
It gives off heat. 

00:22:51.867 --> 00:23:00.200
Now let's take two double bonds,
and they're conjugated. 

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.467
That turns out to remove both of
those and go 

00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:06.000
down here is 54. 

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.833
That is, the second double bond
was worth 26. 

00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:13.100
Is everybody with me on that? 

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.000
So 26 isn't as big as 28. 

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
That means this was a little bit
lower than 

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.767
we would have expected. 

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:21.967
Why? 

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:24.267
Because it's conjugated. 

00:23:24.267 --> 00:23:27.300
It's better than just two
isolated double bonds, because 

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.667
they're conjugated. 

00:23:28.667 --> 00:23:31.167
The lowest orbital went down a
little more than the 

00:23:31.167 --> 00:23:32.200
next one went up. 

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.333
That's what we just talked
about. 

00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:37.300
But that's not very much to
write home about. 

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.167
It says that conjugation is
worth about two kilocalories 

00:23:40.167 --> 00:23:42.900
per mole by this measure. 

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:46.800
Now let's put another double
bond in the ring, and tell me 

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.767
what you think that's going to
be? 

00:23:49.767 --> 00:23:51.867
What do you think the gap is
going to be here? 

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:58.100
Any ideas? 

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.600
Let's get a couple hypotheses
out there. 

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.067
Cassie, what do you say? 

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:04.933
STUDENT: Maybe 24. 

00:24:04.933 --> 00:24:07.067
PROFESSOR: Why do you say 24? 

00:24:07.067 --> 00:24:08.167
Why not 26? 

00:24:08.167 --> 00:24:09.633
STUDENT: Because 26 was less
than 28. 

00:24:13.533 --> 00:24:16.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it was a little
bit less, maybe a 

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.000
little less again. 

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.033
Another reason it could be less
again is this last double 

00:24:20.033 --> 00:24:23.500
bond interacts on two ends, not
just on one end. 

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.067
So it might get two of those
interactions. 

00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:31.667
So maybe 24, maybe 22, if it
depended on

00:24:31.667 --> 00:24:33.133
how we'd calculate that.

00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:35.967
That would predict that we'd get
about 78. 

00:24:35.967 --> 00:24:40.267
The heat of hydrogenation of
benzene to give cyclohexane 

00:24:40.267 --> 00:24:42.667
should be about 78 altogether. 

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:45.700
You know what it is
experimentally? 

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:52.500
49. 

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.667
So this conjugation in a ring,
in benzene, is 

00:24:56.667 --> 00:24:58.200
really worth a lot. 

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.400
Not just a little bit more
because you get the same thing 

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.767
on two ends, but a lot more. 

00:25:03.767 --> 00:25:06.267
It's worth about 30 kilocalories
per mole. 

00:25:06.267 --> 00:25:08.900
Here we were talking about two
kilocalories per mole. 

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:09.633
This is 30. 

00:25:09.633 --> 00:25:11.400
So this is a big deal. 

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.367
And this is such a big deal,
that it has a special name 

00:25:14.367 --> 00:25:15.400
associated with it. 

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.233
It's called aromaticity. 

00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:19.667
The name originally had to do
with the odor. 

00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:21.467
Benzene has a characteristic
odor. 

00:25:21.467 --> 00:25:24.100
And other things that have
benzene in them, that are 

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.133
volatile, have a characteristic
odor. 

00:25:26.133 --> 00:25:27.733
They were called aromatic. 

00:25:27.733 --> 00:25:30.433
But now the idea of aromaticity
is much more 

00:25:30.433 --> 00:25:33.467
associated with this special
stability, when you have a 

00:25:33.467 --> 00:25:35.000
bunch of double bonds in a ring.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:42.267
So bringing the ends of a
conjugated chain together to 

00:25:42.267 --> 00:25:49.133
form a ring gives the lowest
occupied orbital 

00:25:49.133 --> 00:25:51.533
with another bond. 

00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:53.867
We've got all these p orbitals
in a row, remember, and we 

00:25:53.867 --> 00:25:56.000
made it a little bit bigger in
the middle, a little smaller 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.167
on the end, to optimize the
overlap. 

00:25:58.167 --> 00:26:01.533
But if we bring them around, and
touch the ends, for no 

00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:06.500
additional charge we get an
extra bond here. 

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.267
A whole new pi bond. 

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:11.933
So that's much more effective
than just these little changes 

00:26:11.933 --> 00:26:15.600
that are made by adjusting the
sizes. 

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.867
So the lowest molecular orbital
now will have N of 

00:26:19.867 --> 00:26:23.933
these overlaps, rather than N-1.

00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:25.933
Are you with me on that? 

00:26:25.933 --> 00:26:30.567
When we had a chain, the number
of pairs down the chain 

00:26:30.567 --> 00:26:33.867
was one less than the number of
atoms. But if we bring them 

00:26:33.867 --> 00:26:36.100
together and let the ends touch,
then 

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.200
we get another one. 

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.267
So it's N/N. 

00:26:38.267 --> 00:26:41.967
So it goes to minus 1, the
lowest possible energy. 

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:46.567
So in a conjugated ring, the
nodes as you go around the 

00:26:46.567 --> 00:26:50.000
ring must come in an even
number. 

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.333
Let's look for example if at a
three-membered ring. 

00:26:52.333 --> 00:26:56.433
So here are three p orbitals
viewed from the top. 

00:26:56.433 --> 00:26:58.633
So there are no nodes,
obviously. 

00:26:58.633 --> 00:27:01.800
And the energy of that is going
to be minus one, on the 

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:04.867
scale we were talking about. 

00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:07.700
Each of these is 1 over the
square root of 3. 

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.133
The overlap here is 1/3. 

00:27:10.133 --> 00:27:13.000
1/3, 1/3, 1/3, totals to 1. 

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.467
Minus 1 in energy. 

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:16.600
And there are no nodes. 

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.867
But now let's suppose we want to
make a node. 

00:27:19.867 --> 00:27:24.167
But now here we have an energy
that's 1/2. 

00:27:24.167 --> 00:27:26.433
It's the same as ethylene. 

00:27:26.433 --> 00:27:30.500
But notice we can't have just
one node as you go around. 

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.100
Because if we go red to blue, we
have to go back. 

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.133
And someplace we're going to
have to have another node as 

00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:39.367
we go around there to get back
to the pink again. 

00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:41.900
You can't just have one node. 

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.000
Unless, just to look ahead a
little bit, you twist it and 

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.133
make a Moebius strip. 

00:27:48.133 --> 00:27:50.133
But that's quite a job. 

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:53.567
We'll see that it has been done,
but it's quite a job. 

00:27:53.567 --> 00:27:55.333
OK, so anyhow, the nodes come in
pairs. 

00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:56.667
So there are two like that. 

00:27:56.667 --> 00:27:59.633
But the other aspect of that --

00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:01.433
I was going to say the flip side
-- 

00:28:01.433 --> 00:28:05.367
is that you get another way of
doing the same thing. 

00:28:05.367 --> 00:28:07.467
So you can get two nodes here. 

00:28:07.467 --> 00:28:09.567
You can also get two nodes that
way. 

00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:13.733
So there are two different ways
to get two nodes. 

00:28:13.733 --> 00:28:17.000
So you have a lowest one, and
then you have a 

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.200
pair that have... 

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.700
There's one with no nodes, 

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.867
then there's a pair with two
nodes. 

00:28:23.867 --> 00:28:26.867
And they have the same energy. 

00:28:26.867 --> 00:28:31.167
So now we can look at the energy
shift that happens when 

00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:33.000
you form one of these rings. 

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.200
That is, how much is the
aromaticity worth? 

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.400
So there was butadiene, which we
did already. 

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.967
Now suppose we bring the ends
together. 

00:28:43.967 --> 00:28:47.200
There was the lowest one, and
now we have an end-to-end 

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.367
interaction. 

00:28:48.367 --> 00:28:50.833
So those interact with one
another, and obviously that's 

00:28:50.833 --> 00:28:55.500
favorable, and it'll go down in
energy Also they'll become 

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:58.500
of the same size, once you do
that, because it's no longer 

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.700
advantageous to have it big in
the middle and small on the 

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.300
ends, because there isn't an end
anymore. 

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.567
How about that one, when you
bring the two ends together 

00:29:07.567 --> 00:29:09.500
and let them touch. 

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.467
What will happen to its energy?

00:29:11.467 --> 00:29:12.800
Ellen, what do you say? 

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.100
STUDENT: Decrease 

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.400
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.367
STUDENT: Decrease 

00:29:17.367 --> 00:29:19.300
PROFESSOR: What do you mean
decrease? 

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.233
Will the energy go up or down
when you touch the two ends? 

00:29:22.233 --> 00:29:23.633
STUDENT: Down 

00:29:23.633 --> 00:29:25.467
PROFESSOR: Why do you say so? 

00:29:25.467 --> 00:29:27.667
STUDENT: Because there'll be
another bond. 

00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:29.100
PROFESSOR: There's another
interaction. 

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.700
But look at the interaction,
look at the colors. 

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:35.967
When you touch the two ends
together, when you bend it 

00:29:35.967 --> 00:29:37.467
around so this touches that. 

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.500
That's antibonding. 

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.900
That's cute, huh? 

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:48.000
OK, so that one's going to go up
in energy. 

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.667
Now how about the next one? 

00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:52.233
That one's going to be
favorable. 

00:29:52.233 --> 00:29:53.967
It'll go down in energy, and end
up the 

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:55.000
same place this was. 

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.800
Remember there was a lowest one,
and then two pairs. 

00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.467
Two which had a pair of nodes. 

00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:08.667
And the next one, that's going
to be unfavorable again. 

00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:11.267
So the structure when you bring
the ends together is 

00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:12.600
going to be different. 

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.433
And fortunately there's a
mnemonic device, a geometric 

00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:21.300
one just like this, that works
in that case as well. 

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:26.167
And notice that the shifts
alternate, down, up, down, up. 

00:30:26.167 --> 00:30:29.500
And they must do that because of
the number of nodes. 

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.467
If you have an even number of
nodes, it'll be favorable 

00:30:32.467 --> 00:30:34.733
because you'll have the same
sign on the two ends. 

00:30:34.733 --> 00:30:37.233
If you have an odd number of
nodes, it'll be unfavorable. 

00:30:37.233 --> 00:30:40.767
So it has to be that down, up,
down, up, as you go up the 

00:30:40.767 --> 00:30:45.900
scale of MOs and curl them to
touch their ends. 

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:49.933
So when you bring the ends of a
chain together, the odd 

00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:53.067
numbered MOs, 1, 3, 5, decrease
in energy. 

00:30:53.067 --> 00:30:59.300
Those are the ones with odd
numbers, therefore an even 

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:00.233
number of nodes. 

00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:03.900
Because the very lowest one, 1,
has no nodes. 

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.133
Sorry for the confusion. 

00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:10.700
While the even numbered ones
increase in energy. 

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:16.767
Thus, if you have an odd number
of occupied MOs, 

00:31:16.767 --> 00:31:21.333
there'll be more going down than
going up. 

00:31:21.333 --> 00:31:22.900
Is that clear? 

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:27.333
If you have an even number of
electron pairs, they'll be 

00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:28.267
down, then up. 

00:31:28.267 --> 00:31:29.067
That will cancel. 

00:31:29.067 --> 00:31:29.867
Down, then up. 

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:30.567
That will cancel. 

00:31:30.567 --> 00:31:31.200
Down, then up. 

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:31.800
That will cancel. 

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.467
But if you have an odd number,
if you have down, then up, 

00:31:34.467 --> 00:31:37.400
then down, there'll be more
downs than up, if you have an 

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.800
odd number of pairs of
electrons. 

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.267
So they're going to get overall
stabilization, special 

00:31:43.267 --> 00:31:47.733
stabilization, due to this
aromaticity, if you have an 

00:31:47.733 --> 00:31:51.633
odd number of electron pairs. 

00:31:51.633 --> 00:31:53.600
Of course, you also have to take
into 

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.900
account the sigma bonds. 

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.367
Because when you bend things
into a ring, you may introduce 

00:31:57.367 --> 00:31:59.367
ring strain, like in the
three-membered ring. 

00:31:59.367 --> 00:32:00.633
There's obviously that. 

00:32:00.633 --> 00:32:03.733
But as far as the pi electrons
go, there's going to be 

00:32:03.733 --> 00:32:05.700
special stability if you have an
odd 

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.000
number of electron pairs. 

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.733
And this gives rise to Hueckel's
rule, as it's called. 

00:32:11.733 --> 00:32:17.067
Which is, if you have 4n+ 2pi
electrons, that's going to 

00:32:17.067 --> 00:32:21.600
be unusually favorable in a
conjugated ring. 

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.400
Compared to what? 

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.500
Compared to a chain that's not
touching the ends. 

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.667
Linear versus ring is going to
be especially stable if you 

00:32:32.667 --> 00:32:37.167
have 4n+2pi electrons. 

00:32:37.167 --> 00:32:39.967
That means an odd number of
electron pairs. 

00:32:39.967 --> 00:32:42.467
So, more of these going down
than up, when you bring the 

00:32:42.467 --> 00:32:44.633
ends together. 

00:32:44.633 --> 00:32:46.767
And as I said, there's a circle
mnemonic. 

00:32:46.767 --> 00:32:50.500
Now remember for a chain, we had
a semi-circle mnemonic. 

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.633
For a ring you have a circle. 

00:32:53.633 --> 00:32:57.833
It's the same radius; minus 1 to
1 is the limit. 

00:32:57.833 --> 00:33:02.967
And now you inscribe a regular
polygon with a point down. 

00:33:02.967 --> 00:33:05.167
Because remember that lowest one
is always going to have 

00:33:05.167 --> 00:33:08.067
minus 1 as its energy, so the
point has got to be at the 

00:33:08.067 --> 00:33:09.967
bottom, like that. 

00:33:09.967 --> 00:33:13.400
Now we put dots on there for the
energies we're going to 

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:17.233
have. And notice after the first
one, they're going to 

00:33:17.233 --> 00:33:19.300
come in pairs. 

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.067
So if you have cyclopropenyl,
those are the energies you're 

00:33:22.067 --> 00:33:24.433
going to have, if you have two
electrons. 

00:33:24.433 --> 00:33:29.500
So the cyclopropenyl cation,
just two electrons that's the 

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.900
energy you're going to have. Had
you had the allyl, the 

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:37.500
three p orbitals in a chain
rather than in a ring, then we 

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.367
already saw you'd have that. 

00:33:39.367 --> 00:33:43.133
So now we've got strong
stabilization of two electrons 

00:33:43.133 --> 00:33:46.433
coming down from here to here. 

00:33:46.433 --> 00:33:49.733
So there's a lot of aromatic
stabilization of the 

00:33:49.733 --> 00:33:52.833
cyclopropenyl cation. 

00:33:52.833 --> 00:33:54.700
Now suppose you have the
radical, the 

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.533
cyclopropenyl radical. 

00:33:56.533 --> 00:33:58.433
Here's the allyl radical. 

00:33:58.433 --> 00:34:01.167
In the cyclopropenyl radical,
two of the electrons will be 

00:34:01.167 --> 00:34:06.333
there, but one has to be up
there, in one with two nodes. 

00:34:06.333 --> 00:34:10.100
So this one is going up more
than those are going down. 

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.967
But there are two going down
here, and one going up. 

00:34:13.967 --> 00:34:16.367
If you have the anion they're
going to be two going up and 

00:34:16.367 --> 00:34:17.633
that's bad. 

00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:24.067
You lose more here, than you
gain here. 

00:34:24.067 --> 00:34:27.033
Now remember, there's always an
MO at minus 1. 

00:34:27.033 --> 00:34:29.967
So what happens if we have
cyclobutadiene? 

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:33.233
Four p orbitals, and four
electrons. 

00:34:33.233 --> 00:34:35.167
Now there are our energies. 

00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:38.000
There are the energy levels. 

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.500
We're going to put two electrons
down here and one in 

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.567
each of those, like that. 

00:34:43.567 --> 00:34:47.467
And we're going to compare it
with normal butadiene which we 

00:34:47.467 --> 00:34:50.200
saw before has a pair here, and
a pair here. 

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.667
Notice that these go up more
than these go 

00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:55.400
down, so it's bad. 

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.867
That's antiaromatic. 

00:34:57.867 --> 00:35:01.133
This stabilization that we saw
in benziene, aromatic 

00:35:01.133 --> 00:35:03.333
stabilization, is the opposite
here. 

00:35:03.333 --> 00:35:06.500
It's bad, overall, all to put
the ends together, although 

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.467
it's good for the best orbital.

00:35:09.467 --> 00:35:11.167
And notice also that these will
be 

00:35:11.167 --> 00:35:12.600
singly-occupied orbitals. 

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.300
So they'll be a little bit like
free radicals. 

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.000
So this is going to be a very
reactive species, 

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.867
cyclobutadiene. 

00:35:20.867 --> 00:35:23.733
Now if you have benzene, you
have six, and 

00:35:23.733 --> 00:35:26.400
they look like that. 

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.967
And now we have six electrons to
put in. 

00:35:28.967 --> 00:35:31.700
And we compare it with
hexatriene, as a 

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.633
chain, which has that. 

00:35:33.633 --> 00:35:36.000
And now you notice these went
down a little. 

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.700
These went down a lot. 

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.133
These went up, but not very
much. 

00:35:40.133 --> 00:35:43.600
So this is where we got that 30
kilocalories of special 

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.067
stabilization in benzene, a
really 

00:35:46.067 --> 00:35:49.333
good example of aromatic. 

00:35:49.333 --> 00:35:53.633
So 4n+2 is the number of
electrons in a ring that will 

00:35:53.633 --> 00:35:56.600
give special stability, because
there'll be more going 

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.300
down than going up. 

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.500
Now that's interesting, and it
prompted organic chemists when 

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.300
this became -- 

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.767
although Hueckel did it in the
early 1930s, it didn't reach 

00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:11.500
the consciousness of most
organic chemists, even though 

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.867
his brother was an organic
chemist, until the 

00:36:14.867 --> 00:36:16.933
late 1950s or 1960s. 

00:36:16.933 --> 00:36:20.000
Then people started trying to
make all kinds of rings with p 

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.367
orbitals with different numbers
of electrons, and see 

00:36:23.367 --> 00:36:24.967
which ones-- could they confirm
this rule. 

00:36:24.967 --> 00:36:27.600
And indeed they did confirm it.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:32.333
But much more interesting was
how the same concept of cyclic 

00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:37.433
conjugation applies to
reactions, and to transition 

00:36:37.433 --> 00:36:41.367
states to make reactions faster
or slower. 

00:36:41.367 --> 00:36:43.767
And in that context we're going
to talk about 

00:36:43.767 --> 00:36:49.167
cyclo-additions and about
electrocyclic reactions. 

00:36:49.167 --> 00:36:51.300
But first I want to mention also

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.067
heteroaromatic compounds. 

00:36:53.067 --> 00:36:56.100
So you can have aromatic
compounds that aren't just 

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.433
carbons in the ring, like for
example nitrogen here. 

00:36:59.433 --> 00:37:01.767
Now think of the electrons on
nitrogen. 

00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:04.767
It's forming sigma bonds to
carbon on either side. 

00:37:04.767 --> 00:37:06.967
It has an unshared pair of
electrons. 

00:37:06.967 --> 00:37:09.467
But that's not part of the pi
system. 

00:37:09.467 --> 00:37:11.733
That's in the plane, right? 

00:37:11.733 --> 00:37:13.933
It's not part of the p orbitals,
which is what we're 

00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:14.933
talking about. 

00:37:14.933 --> 00:37:16.933
It's an sp2 orbital. 

00:37:16.933 --> 00:37:19.767
But there is an electron in the
p orbital. 

00:37:19.767 --> 00:37:21.300
Incidentally, this is redundant.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.867
I drew a double bond here. 

00:37:22.867 --> 00:37:27.733
I'm also counting that electron,
but it's actually 

00:37:27.733 --> 00:37:29.433
participating in that double
bond. 

00:37:29.433 --> 00:37:33.367
But I'm just showing it there so
that we can keep track of 

00:37:33.367 --> 00:37:35.133
what heteroatoms are doing. 

00:37:35.133 --> 00:37:39.767
So there's a p-electron from
each of the five carbons, a 

00:37:39.767 --> 00:37:43.233
p-electron from nitrogen, 6pi
electrons. 

00:37:43.233 --> 00:37:48.667
4n+2 where n equals 1. That's
stable; it's aromatic. 

00:37:48.667 --> 00:37:51.500
Now furan, a five-membered ring
with oxygen. 

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.300
Oxygen has two unshared pairs. 

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.967
So it has two that are in the
sigma system that are 

00:37:55.967 --> 00:37:57.767
irrelevant for our purposes. 

00:37:57.767 --> 00:38:00.167
But it also has two in the pi
system. 

00:38:00.167 --> 00:38:02.633
So now you have one from each of
the carbons in the pi 

00:38:02.633 --> 00:38:05.633
system, two from the oxygen, six
altogether. 

00:38:05.633 --> 00:38:06.100
Great. 

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:08.133
Aromatic. 

00:38:08.133 --> 00:38:09.533
Pyrrole. 

00:38:09.533 --> 00:38:14.033
Now the nitrogen has an unshared
pair in that one. 

00:38:14.033 --> 00:38:16.233
So it's got one, two, three,
four, five, six. 

00:38:16.233 --> 00:38:17.633
Good, that's aromatic too. 

00:38:17.633 --> 00:38:19.433
Unusually stable. 

00:38:19.433 --> 00:38:20.567
Imidazole. 

00:38:20.567 --> 00:38:23.000
This is a tougher one to count.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.500
One of the nitrogens has an
unshared pair 

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.567
that's in the plane. 

00:38:26.567 --> 00:38:28.867
Don't count that one. 

00:38:28.867 --> 00:38:31.767
The other one has a unshared
pair that's coming in and out 

00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:32.267
of the plane. 

00:38:32.267 --> 00:38:34.667
That's part of the pi system. 

00:38:34.667 --> 00:38:37.400
And there's a single electron on
this nitrogen, as 

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.567
there was over here. 

00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:40.600
So now we have one on each of
three 

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.267
carbons, four, five, six. 

00:38:43.267 --> 00:38:45.767
That's aromatic too, imidazole.

00:38:45.767 --> 00:38:48.567
Incidentally that structure, it
occurs in 

00:38:48.567 --> 00:38:50.333
the amino acid histidine. 

00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:55.300
And that's really interesting,
in that it is involved in 

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.800
long-range proton transfer in
enzymes. 

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:02.900
Suppose you have a proton here,
but where you need it is 

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.100
way over here. 

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:08.000
What you can do is this. 

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.467
So this hydrogen goes up, this
hydrogen goes onto the ring, 

00:39:16.467 --> 00:39:21.767
and the ring sort of looks like
it's turned over. 

00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:24.167
But a hydrogen has gotten up
where you want it, without 

00:39:24.167 --> 00:39:27.533
actually having to move the
proton all that way. 

00:39:27.533 --> 00:39:30.400
So these are all what are called
heteroaromatic 

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.033
compounds, because they have
atoms other than carbon in the 

00:39:34.033 --> 00:39:37.033
ring, but they're stable for the
same reason. 

00:39:37.033 --> 00:39:39.600
We could look at the orbitals of
furan, the one with an 

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.800
oxygen in it. 

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.333
There's the lowest- energy
orbital. 

00:39:42.333 --> 00:39:45.233
It's what you expect, p orbitals
all overlapping 

00:39:45.233 --> 00:39:48.033
favorably all around the
periphery. 

00:39:48.033 --> 00:39:50.367
No antibonding nodes. 

00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:54.067
But then there are two that have
antibonding nodes. 

00:39:54.067 --> 00:39:56.700
There's one that has an
antibonding node at the back 

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.433
and in the front here. 

00:39:58.433 --> 00:40:01.533
So it's plus on one side, minus
on the other. 

00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:04.067
And there's another one that has
an antibonding node that 

00:40:04.067 --> 00:40:05.067
goes across. 

00:40:05.067 --> 00:40:08.100
So it intersects the ring both
here and here. 

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.600
So it's plus in back, minus in
front. 

00:40:14.067 --> 00:40:20.433
And remember there are six
electrons in this. 

00:40:20.433 --> 00:40:22.267
Two here, two here, two here. 

00:40:22.267 --> 00:40:24.333
These are the antibonding
orbitals. 

00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:26.733
And they, as you can see, have
four. 

00:40:26.733 --> 00:40:30.467
Each of them has four nodes as
you go around the periphery. 

00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:33.067
So for example, here there's a
node on the oxygen, a node 

00:40:33.067 --> 00:40:35.867
between the carbons, a node
between the carbons, a node 

00:40:35.867 --> 00:40:37.067
between the carbons. 

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:39.667
Four nodes as you go around the
ring. 

00:40:39.667 --> 00:40:43.600
So these are a pair of the same
energy. 

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.700
Now if you want you can go to
that program you can get on 

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:53.667
the web, and draw crude
calculations to see 

00:40:53.667 --> 00:40:55.200
this kind of thing. 

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:58.700
So here's benzene, and here are
the energies 

00:40:58.700 --> 00:40:59.400
we're talking about. 

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:02.067
A lowest energy orbital with a
pair of electrons, and then 

00:41:02.067 --> 00:41:05.500
the next two, "degenerate," as
they're called, pair. 

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:09.167
And then antibonding, worst. 

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:11.600
Now what happens if you put a
nitrogen in the ring? 

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.033
Now the lowest energy orbital is
bigger on nitrogen, than on 

00:41:15.033 --> 00:41:17.900
the other atoms. Why? 

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.833
Anybody got an idea why it
should be bigger on nitrogen? 

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:23.333
Amy, you got an idea? 

00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:25.800
STUDENT: It's more
electronegative. 

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.167
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it has a bigger
nuclear charge; it's a 

00:41:28.167 --> 00:41:29.933
better place for the electrons
to be. 

00:41:29.933 --> 00:41:32.467
It's more electronegative, as
you say. 

00:41:32.467 --> 00:41:32.900
OK. 

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.000
And so it's lower in energy,
see, than it was here. 

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.567
It's larger on the N, and it's
lower in energy. 

00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:45.833
Now if we look at this, the next
orbital here, it has two 

00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:48.833
nodes, here and here. 

00:41:48.833 --> 00:41:50.333
Here it was in benzene. 

00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:52.967
Here it is it in the nitrogen
analog. 

00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:56.200
And notice it's the same energy,
here and here, because 

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.800
it's the same orbital. 

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.967
In fact, what it is, this is a
pi bond, here's a pi bond. 

00:42:02.967 --> 00:42:04.867
They don't interact with one
another. 

00:42:04.867 --> 00:42:06.700
So the energy is minus one. 

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.067
It's the energy of a pi bond. 

00:42:10.067 --> 00:42:11.033
And it's the same here. 

00:42:11.033 --> 00:42:13.267
And nitrogen doesn't have
anything to do with it. 

00:42:13.267 --> 00:42:16.633
But the other one, there was
another one here. 

00:42:16.633 --> 00:42:19.467
So those were identical in shape
and in energy. 

00:42:19.467 --> 00:42:21.900
But there's another one that has
the two nodes across the 

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.400
middle here, and across here. 

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.533
And now it does involve
nitrogen. 

00:42:26.533 --> 00:42:30.667
So this one is high electron
density on nitrogen, and 

00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:33.000
therefore a little bit lower
energy. 

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
So these two orbitals that we
just looked at that had two 

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.800
nodes, were the same energy
here, but 

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.067
different energy in pyridine. 

00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:44.367
One with nitrogen. 

00:42:44.367 --> 00:42:47.200
Now suppose you have 10 atoms in
a ring. 

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.067
Cyclodecapentaene. 

00:42:49.067 --> 00:42:54.967
Here are the structures, here
are the energies. 

00:42:54.967 --> 00:42:58.267
And now here's the lowest one,
same as you go all around. 

00:42:58.267 --> 00:43:04.233
The next ones have a node here,
that is, two nodes as 

00:43:04.233 --> 00:43:06.767
you go around the periphery. 

00:43:06.767 --> 00:43:09.400
But notice these, right and
left, don't interact. 

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.800
There's no orbital here. 

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.533
So this is just like butadiene,
and it's the same 

00:43:13.533 --> 00:43:15.467
energy as butadiene. 

00:43:15.467 --> 00:43:18.433
And same for this one, which has
the horizontal node. 

00:43:18.433 --> 00:43:22.167
Same energy, here, as they would
have been in butadiene. 

00:43:22.167 --> 00:43:25.000
Now the next one has four nodes
as you go around, and 

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.333
four nodes as you go around. 

00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:31.933
Now, naphthalene is two benzene

00:43:31.933 --> 00:43:34.467
rings next to one another. 

00:43:34.467 --> 00:43:38.167
How can you go from this to
naphthalene, to two 

00:43:38.167 --> 00:43:39.200
six-membered rings? 

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.667
What you can do is take the atom
that's in the middle on 

00:43:41.667 --> 00:43:44.367
the top and in the middle on the
bottom, and pull them 

00:43:44.367 --> 00:43:47.133
together so they overlap, like
this. 

00:43:50.033 --> 00:43:51.800
So then you have two benzene
rings together. 

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.900
That's naphthalene. 

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.067
Now let's look at the energies
of that and see why they come 

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:58.667
out to be the way they do. 

00:43:58.667 --> 00:44:02.300
So the very lowest one, we
brought this one to touch that 

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:05.633
one, so we introduced a new
bond. 

00:44:05.633 --> 00:44:06.900
So it got lower in energy. 

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.233
And it's big in the middle, as
you expect, because it has 

00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:14.200
more interactions. 

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.333
Now the next one. 

00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:19.700
If we take this one and draw the
top and bottom together 

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.067
like that, it makes no
difference because are no 

00:44:22.067 --> 00:44:22.767
orbitals there. 

00:44:22.767 --> 00:44:24.367
It's on a node. 

00:44:24.367 --> 00:44:28.800
So that has the same energy,
here, here, and here. 

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.200
But if we bring the top to
bottom together here, what's 

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.467
going to happen? 

00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:40.700
Noah, 

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.600
what do you say? 

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:46.067
If I touched this to this, is
that favorable or unfavorable? 

00:44:46.067 --> 00:44:48.867
STUDENT: Unfavorable. 

00:44:48.867 --> 00:44:50.267
PROFESSOR: It's unfavorable. 

00:44:50.267 --> 00:44:53.233
So the other one will go up in
energy to there. 

00:44:58.733 --> 00:45:01.400
And now, how about this one up
at the top? 

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.533
If we bring this to touch that,
makes no difference. 

00:45:04.533 --> 00:45:07.000
There's no orbital there when
you have a node. 

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.700
So that comes straight across. 

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.100
But how about if we touch this
to this? Noah? 

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.967
STUDENT: Favorable. 

00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:16.367
That's going to be favorable. So
although that one goes 

00:45:16.367 --> 00:45:17.867
straight across, the next one
goes down in energy. 

00:45:17.867 --> 00:45:21.067
So we can understand the special
stability of 

00:45:21.067 --> 00:45:23.267
naphthalene compared to
cyclodecapentaene. 

00:45:28.667 --> 00:45:32.733
And notice, not only that, but
this one which has nodes here 

00:45:32.733 --> 00:45:35.600
and here, has just isolated
pairs of 

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:36.967
overlapping p orbitals. 

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:40.633
So it's the same energy as
ethylene would be, because 

00:45:40.633 --> 00:45:41.867
it's the same interaction. 

00:45:44.667 --> 00:45:48.267
OK now can you make that
compound, cyclodecapentaene? 

00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:50.533
I'm going to quit with this one,
OK? 

00:45:50.533 --> 00:45:54.000
And in fact it was made by Heinz
Dieter Roth, who was a 

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.500
post-doc here, later. 

00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.067
But he did this in Germany with
Emanuel Vogel. 

00:46:00.067 --> 00:46:03.167
You can't make a ring that's
that big, without having 

00:46:03.167 --> 00:46:07.400
enormous carbon-carbon-carbon
angles, and have it be flat. 

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.400
But you could bend it in, like
this, except for the fact that 

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.900
those two hydrogens touch one
another. 

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:14.433
That's not good. 

00:46:14.433 --> 00:46:17.133
So one thing you could do is
just make that a bond. 

00:46:17.133 --> 00:46:19.800
And we've already talked about
that, that's naphthalene. 

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.067
That was the previous slide. 

00:46:22.067 --> 00:46:27.333
But another way is to put a
bridge across, like CH2, from 

00:46:27.333 --> 00:46:30.067
this carbon to this carbon, so
that those two atoms don't run 

00:46:30.067 --> 00:46:31.967
into one another. 

00:46:31.967 --> 00:46:35.167
That'll distort the periphery a
little bit, but it will 

00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:37.800
leave all the p orbitals around
the edge. 

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.533
So the way they made it, was to
first add dichlorocarbene 

00:46:41.533 --> 00:46:43.867
to a double bond in the middle.

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:46.467
Then remove the chlorines. 

00:46:46.467 --> 00:46:50.533
And now this thing could open
that central bond to give 

00:46:50.533 --> 00:46:54.200
this, and it does that. 

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.500
Here's a picture of what it
looks like. 

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.367
So here's the CH2 bridge across
the middle, but all 

00:46:59.367 --> 00:47:04.633
around the periphery you have 10
atoms with p orbitals. 

00:47:04.633 --> 00:47:05.967
And there's one of the orbitals.

00:47:05.967 --> 00:47:07.500
And you see that's the one that
has two 

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.100
nodes, here and here. 

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:12.267
So you have five p orbitals
here, and 

00:47:12.267 --> 00:47:15.367
five p orbitals here. 

00:47:15.367 --> 00:47:18.767
Now there's another criterion
for aromaticity, which is the 

00:47:18.767 --> 00:47:21.600
chemical shift in proton
magnetic resonance, and 

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:27.767
we'll see that next week. 

00:47:27.767 --> 00:47:31.200
"OK, so there's actually a
little more here. 

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:34.267
I hoped I'd get it, but there's
going to be like five 

00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:37.400
minutes in the next lecture
that'll also be on this exam, 

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.633
but the next stuff will not be
on the exam. 

00:47:39.633 --> 00:47:40.700
We're meeting this evening. 

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.300
I haven't checked what the room
is, but I'll email you. 

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.400
OK? 

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:45.667
Thanks."

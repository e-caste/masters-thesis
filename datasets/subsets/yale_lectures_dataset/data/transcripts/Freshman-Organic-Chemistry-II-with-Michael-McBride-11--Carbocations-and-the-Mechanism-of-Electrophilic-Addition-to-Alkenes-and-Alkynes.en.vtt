00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.333
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So the
second part of the last 

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.733
lecture introduced the idea of 

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.600
alkenes, and we were talking
about the stability of 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.667
alkenes, cis versus trans, and
the effect of substitution. 

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.833
We'll go on with that today, and
then go on to addition 

00:00:21.833 --> 00:00:24.100
mechanisms, which is a
characteristic 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.100
reactivity of alkenes. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.733
So if we look at the stabilities
of these C6 alkene 

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.700
isomers that we talked about
last time, we showed how you 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.433
can get the numbers for those
from the NIST website. 

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:48.267
It's also possible to get them
from this book by Pedley. 

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:51.967
That's the one that Professor
Wiberg, who's a big expert on 

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:56.233
this, recommended to me as a
good source. 

00:00:56.233 --> 00:01:03.467
So here's the heat of formation
of the straight 

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:08.600
chain with a double bond in the
number one position. 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.567
What does heat of formation,
what's that the 

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:13.733
heat relative to? 

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.800
The energy of this molecule
compared to what? 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.600
The heat of formation. 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.333
Rehearse from last semester. 

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.167
Mary? 

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:27.167
STUDENT: Is it the heat of
atomization to-- 

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.133
PROFESSOR: It's not the heat of
atomization. 

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.300
How do you measure such things?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.133
How do you measure the heat of a
molecule? 

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.833
STUDENT: You have to heat it
up-- 

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:36.367
PROFESSOR: Can't hear too well.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:37.200
STUDENT: You have to heat it up
until it's 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.433
really, really hot. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.367
PROFESSOR: That was the way that
you got the heat of 

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:46.833
formation of carbon atoms from
graphite, remember? 

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:52.267
But that only needed to be done
once, to get where carbon 

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:55.167
atom is relative to graphite. 

00:01:55.167 --> 00:01:58.733
Then you need to know the energy
of molecules relative 

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.267
to graphite. 

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:02.667
How do you do that? 

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:03.533
STUDENT: You want to break the
bonds in graphite and then 

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:04.767
break the bonds-- 

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:11.567
PROFESSOR: But that's a very
difficult thing to do, to 

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:12.600
break the bonds in graphite. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.333
Matt, do you have an idea? 

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.300
STUDENT: Do you combust
graphite? 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.400
PROFESSOR: You burn them. 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.600
You compare them to CO2. 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.367
So you take your molecule and
burn it, we talked about this 

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.367
last semester. 

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:26.767
You burn graphite. 

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:30.667
You also burn H2, so you can get
a hydrocarbon. 

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:34.133
What's the energy of your
compound, compared to the 

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:36.533
amount of energy that was in
hydrogen 

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:38.900
and carbon of graphite. 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.567
So anyhow, the heat of formation
is -10 or a little 

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:47.100
bit more kilocalories per mole.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.367
That means it's that much more
stable than the elements would 

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:54.767
be in their defined standard
state. 

00:02:54.767 --> 00:03:00.500
Now if you look at it for the
cis-3-hexene, the double bond 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.133
beginning on the third carbon,
it's a little bit more stable. 

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:08.900
And that doesn't surprise you,
because we've talked about 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.900
having more carbons as opposed
to hydrogens on a double- 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.233
bonded carbon 

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:19.600
makes the compound more stable.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.833
That is, that the CH bonds don't
profit as much from the 

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:30.433
change in hybridization as C-C
bonds seem to do. 

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:34.900
Now if you have the trans
isomer, it's still more stable 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.033
by about one and a half
kilocalories. 

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:38.667
I don't know whether you had a
chance to look at 

00:03:38.667 --> 00:03:39.467
the problems yet. 

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:40.200
Probably not. 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.033
They were for Wednesday. 

00:03:42.033 --> 00:03:43.633
Just look at the generalities. 

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:48.133
But you find that the trans
isomer is about one and a half 

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.667
kilocalories more stable than
the cis. 

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:52.633
Can you think of any explanation
for that? 

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:57.200
Amy? 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.333
STUDENT: Less repulsion from
the-- in cis there's repulsion 

00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.600
from the hydrogens that are on
the same side. 

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.700
PROFESSOR: The groups run into
one another, it's a steric 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.633
effect when they're cis. 

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:10.067
That's worth about one and a
half kilocalories per mole. 

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:13.600
OK, now if you make three
carbon-carbon bonds from the 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.633
double bond-- 

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:19.933
incidentally there's a table
that has those in it too in 

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:21.300
the Jones book. 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.533
If you put three carbons on the
double bond, then it's 

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.067
more stable still. 

00:04:26.067 --> 00:04:28.533
And obviously if you put four,
it's a little 

00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:30.833
bit more stable still. 

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:36.700
Now if we come back and look at
correcting for strain, 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.767
which was what we attributed the
difference between cis and 

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:46.333
trans to, we find that there's
3.6 kilocalories of molecular 

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:50.433
mechanics strain in the cis, and
2.5 in the trans. 

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:54.633
So it's what you said, Amy, that
the molecular mechanics 

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:58.933
explains it, in terms of a
steric effect. 

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:03.600
So the average then, for those
two, is about there. 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.500
And now if we make strain
corrections for the other 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.600
molecules as well, calculate the
strain by molecular 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.900
mechanics, there's 2.8
kilocalories of strain 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.500
calculated there, 2.6 and 7.7 in
the one that has four 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.067
carbons on the double bond. 

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:24.700
And now you notice something
interesting about the trend. 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.667
Once you've corrected for
strain, what do you notice? 

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:32.333
It's almost exactly linear
according to the 

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.400
number of C-C bonds. 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.167
So you gain in stability, about
two and a half 

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:43.533
kilocalories per mole every time
you substitute a C-H with 

00:05:43.533 --> 00:05:48.767
a C-C, keeping the same number
of carbons and hydrogens in 

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:51.933
the molecule, discussing isomers
of one another. 

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:55.533
Because of course it makes no
sense to compare heats of 

00:05:55.533 --> 00:05:58.000
formation of molecules that are
not 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.567
isomers of one another. 

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:04.667
You're comparing apples with
oranges. 

00:06:04.667 --> 00:06:09.000
So that could be due to this
hybridization. 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.267
It could, in part, be due to
hyperconjugation, that we 

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:17.133
talked about before, and we'll
talk a little bit 

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:19.500
more about it later. 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.533
Now let's think about the
thermochemistry involved in 

00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:26.667
alkene/HCl reactions. 

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:31.833
So here's HCl plus an alkene, to
give the addition product, 

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:36.200
where H is added to one carbon,
and Cl to the other. 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.333
So notice we've converted a
single bond and a double bond 

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:45.167
on the left into three single
bonds on the right. 

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:48.267
Is that likely to be favorable
or unfavorable? 

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:51.133
What's the energy of a double
bond compared 

00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:53.300
to two single bonds? 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.533
That's what we've done here. 

00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:04.767
You remember from our table we
looked at in the first semester?

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:07.133
Is the second bond of a double
bond worth 

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.833
as much as the first? 

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:09.333
More? 

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:10.600
Less? 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.533
STUDENT: Less. 

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:13.300
PROFESSOR: It's worth less. 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.200
So if we look back at that table
that we looked at last 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:22.733
semester and put actual numbers
to these bonds that 

00:07:22.733 --> 00:07:27.600
we've drawn here, we see that
the hydrogen chloride bond is 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.400
worth 103 kilocalories per mole.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.400
The double bond, carbon-carbon
double bond, is a 146. 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.333
So there's 249 that we're losing
in 

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:39.833
the starting material. 

00:07:39.833 --> 00:07:42.600
So how much do we gain in the
product making the three 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.200
single bonds? 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:53.700
So there's 104, and 83, and 81.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.767
So 268. 

00:07:54.767 --> 00:07:58.633
In other words, it's profitable
by 19 kilocalories 

00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:00.800
per mole to do this addition. 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.933
And we talked about this before,
when we were talking 

00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:08.067
about chain reaction addition of
HCl, or HBr, 

00:08:08.067 --> 00:08:09.367
of HI, and so on. 

00:08:09.367 --> 00:08:13.033
All of them were exothermic by
about that much. 

00:08:13.033 --> 00:08:19.200
So it's favorable by about 19
kilocalories per mole. 

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.167
Now we could also look more
specifically at these 

00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:25.567
compounds by using that data
that's in the table that we 

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.833
accessed last time from National
Institute of Science 

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:29.167
and Technology [correction:
National Institute of 

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:31.500
Standards and Technology], to
look at the actual heats of 

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:36.433
formation of these particular
molecules in the gas phase. 

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:39.867
That is, before we were just
looking at average bond 

00:08:39.867 --> 00:08:43.167
energies to get an order of
magnitude idea of what's going 

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:45.833
on, or better than an order of
magnitude. 

00:08:45.833 --> 00:08:49.000
But these now will give us the
precise values. 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.533
And where we said it was 19
before, now we see that, for 

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:56.000
this specific set of compounds,
it's 14.5. 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.167
But we were about right. 

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:58.400
It was a good guess before. 

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.400
So this reaction should go to
the right. 

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.967
But we've already talked about a
reaction 

00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:11.533
that goes to the left. 

00:09:11.533 --> 00:09:14.833
What reaction would that be, the
one that starts on the 

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:18.067
right and goes to the left? 

00:09:18.067 --> 00:09:20.200
That's the elimination reaction.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.000
An E2 reaction goes from right
to left. 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.267
What's the difference? 

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.333
If this equilibrium lies to the
right, how could we have 

00:09:31.333 --> 00:09:34.633
spent all this time in the last
quarter of the course 

00:09:34.633 --> 00:09:37.933
talking about reactions going
the other way? 

00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:39.333
Isn't that uphill in energy? 

00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:46.000
What reagent do you use to do
the elimination? 

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.200
STUDENT: Base. 

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.800
PROFESSOR: Strong base, right? 

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.833
Like hydroxide. 

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:55.900
So let's see what happens if we
put hydroxide into the mix. 

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.967
So in acid we get addition. 

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:03.333
And it's favorable by 14
kilocalories per mole, in this 

00:10:03.333 --> 00:10:04.667
particular case. 

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:08.067
But if we put hydroxide in
there, now what 

00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:09.500
will it react with? 

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.467
Well, we talked about how it
pulls off the proton at the 

00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:17.500
same time chloride leaves in the
E2 reaction. 

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.700
But if all we're doing is
studying thermochemistry, we 

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.167
could look at where it is in the
product, in the balance of 

00:10:25.167 --> 00:10:26.867
the two sides of the equation. 

00:10:26.867 --> 00:10:32.067
So what it does on the left is
take the proton away from HCl, 

00:10:32.067 --> 00:10:34.633
to give water and chloride. 

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:40.367
Now HCl is a much stronger acid
than water is. 

00:10:40.367 --> 00:10:44.467
So that's a very favorable
process, to take the proton 

00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:48.100
away from HCl, and to put it on
hydroxide. 

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:53.233
And in fact, we could find out
how different it is by looking 

00:10:53.233 --> 00:10:57.633
up in that same table the proton
affinities of OH minus 

00:10:57.633 --> 00:11:00.933
and chloride, and we find they
differ by 19 

00:11:00.933 --> 00:11:02.833
kilocalories per mole. 

00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:06.900
So adding hydroxide stabilizes
the left side of this equation 

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.800
by 19 kilocalories per mole, and
now it's favorable to go 

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.500
the other way by four and a half
kilocalories per mole. 

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400
So in base, you do elimination.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.233
You go the other way. 

00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:25.467
Now are these really the reverse
of one another? 

00:11:25.467 --> 00:11:31.933
Do we just run the machine
backwards to get elimination, 

00:11:31.933 --> 00:11:34.667
or to get addition, as compared
to the elimination we 

00:11:34.667 --> 00:11:36.067
talked about before? 

00:11:36.067 --> 00:11:39.467
Or is it a different mechanism
because the 

00:11:39.467 --> 00:11:42.067
conditions are different? 

00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:45.333
The elimination was done in the
presence of strong base. 

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:47.967
The addition is done in the
presence of acid. 

00:11:47.967 --> 00:11:52.500
So you might not be able to run
the machine backwards. 

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.833
So incidentally, here's a
problem for you to look at for 

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:57.000
Wednesday too. 

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.733
Use the pKa values for HCl and
H2O to estimate-- 

00:12:03.733 --> 00:12:08.633
here I looked it up, actually,
the proton affinities in NIST, 

00:12:08.633 --> 00:12:11.900
and got 19 kilocalories per
mole. 

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.467
But you could have done the same
thing out of your head, 

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.933
or out of a simple table. 

00:12:16.933 --> 00:12:22.167
Does anybody remember what the
pKa of HCl is? 

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:23.567
STUDENT: Maybe nine? 

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:26.000
PROFESSOR: The exam was Friday,
I realize that. 

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.967
You can scrub that now. 

00:12:27.967 --> 00:12:30.633
Anybody remember about what it
is? 

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.867
I think it's minus eight. 

00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:35.500
Isn't it? [correction: -3] 

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.867
How about the pKa of water? 

00:12:37.867 --> 00:12:39.500
STUDENT: Negative 16. 

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.767
PROFESSOR: Right, negative 16
[correction: positive 16]. 

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:45.433
So from that difference, you can
calculate what the energy 

00:12:45.433 --> 00:12:47.367
of that reaction would be. 

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.933
So try it from that difference
and see if you can do it. 

00:12:49.933 --> 00:12:52.267
That's a good exercise for you.

00:12:52.267 --> 00:12:54.367
But at any rate, we have the
question of the addition of 

00:12:54.367 --> 00:12:55.100
the mechanism. 

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:01.100
Is it the reverse of the E2 or
E1 mechanism? 

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.400
So we're going to talk about
addition to alkenes, and we've 

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.500
already done that to a certain
extent. 

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.000
We talked about the SOMO
mechanism, the free radical 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.667
chain addition of HBr, and you
remember what that is, that 

00:13:12.667 --> 00:13:18.400
the bromine atom adds to give
the more stable radical, which 

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.233
then attacks HBr, taking off the
hydrogen 

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:23.967
atom, to give the product. 

00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:28.100
It gives that product, and
there's a reference in the 

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:33.133
textbook, it gives that product,
not the one above. 

00:13:33.133 --> 00:13:35.333
And it doesn't give that one. 

00:13:35.333 --> 00:13:37.333
It's regioselective. 

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:42.700
And remember we called this
anti-Markovnikov. Markovnikov 

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.967
had the idea, as we talked about
last time, that the 

00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:50.467
carbon that has more
substituents gets more. 

00:13:50.467 --> 00:13:54.300
So if you had two methyl groups
already on one of the 

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.067
double-bonded carbons, it would
be the one that gets the 

00:13:57.067 --> 00:14:00.367
bromine, that the hydrogen goes
to the other one. 

00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:06.200
But this is anti-Markovnikov, it
does the opposite. 

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.700
So we've already talked about
that. 

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:11.633
And the key feature in the
regioselection is getting the 

00:14:11.633 --> 00:14:13.800
more stable carbon radical. 

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:20.067
But it's also conceivable that
there could be a HOMO-LUMO 

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:24.533
mechanism, a concerted one,
where the new group comes up 

00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:27.333
to the double bond, and the
partners just 

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.133
exchange like this. 

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:33.067
Suppose you had H2 to react
with, with the carbon-carbon 

00:14:33.067 --> 00:14:36.900
double bond, a very exothermic
reaction. 

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.300
So you could just shift electron
pairs like that, and 

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.467
perform the addition. 

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:46.433
Now let's look at the orbitals
that would 

00:14:46.433 --> 00:14:49.233
be involved in that. 

00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:52.733
What's the HOMO of the C-C
double bond? 

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.333
Ellen? 

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:01.267
STUDENT: Pi? 

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:02.500
PROFESSOR: Pi. 

00:15:04.267 --> 00:15:07.367
And the LUMO is pi-star. 

00:15:07.367 --> 00:15:10.500
So let's try to bring the LUMO
and the HOMO of 

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.367
the H2 down on top. 

00:15:14.367 --> 00:15:16.000
Look good to mix HOMO and LUMO?

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.067
What do you call that situation?

00:15:28.367 --> 00:15:29.833
Rahul? 

00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:31.333
STUDENT: It's out of phase? 

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:32.867
PROFESSOR: They're out of phase.

00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:35.367
In fact, there's a specific word
to talk about things that 

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:38.967
don't overlap for this symmetry
kind of reason. 

00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:40.833
Remember what it is? 

00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:42.067
They're orthogonal, Anurag says.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.933
So there's no mixing of HOMO of
one with LUMO of the other. 

00:15:47.933 --> 00:15:52.467
Of course you could shift them
so that they mix. 

00:15:52.467 --> 00:15:55.200
But then there's nothing to be
gained, because on the left, 

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.767
you're mixing filled with
filled. 

00:15:56.767 --> 00:15:57.667
That's repulsive. 

00:15:57.667 --> 00:15:59.800
And on the right, the orbitals
are empty. 

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.033
There's nothing that has
whatever energies are 

00:16:02.033 --> 00:16:03.900
available for those orbitals. 

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.300
So you can't do this reaction. 

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:10.733
You can't just bring AB single
bond down on top of a double 

00:16:10.733 --> 00:16:14.033
bond and change partners,
because the symmetry is wrong 

00:16:14.033 --> 00:16:14.800
of the orbitals. 

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.067
They won't mix that way. 

00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:18.300
You can't draw those two arrows.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.767
However, it turns out that if
you use certain catalysts, in 

00:16:22.767 --> 00:16:27.133
particular metals like platinum,
they make it 

00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:31.500
possible to do this, because the
platinum gets involved. 

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.933
It gets its orbitals involved,
and there can 

00:16:33.933 --> 00:16:35.567
be favorable overlap. 

00:16:35.567 --> 00:16:37.667
And we'll be talking about that
pretty soon. 

00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:43.167
You see it in the Jones book:
it's in chapter 10. 

00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:46.133
So that would be a concerted
reaction, where you make and 

00:16:46.133 --> 00:16:48.333
break bonds at the same time. 

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:51.533
But it's also possible to do it
stepwise. 

00:16:51.533 --> 00:16:55.233
That's why the reactions are
called electrophilic, because 

00:16:55.233 --> 00:17:02.000
you have an acid, for example
HBr, and the HOMO attacks the 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.300
sigma-star LUMO, attacks the
proton to give off bromide. 

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.233
And then the bromide can attack
the 

00:17:11.233 --> 00:17:12.533
intermediate cation. 

00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:14.833
So it's a two step reaction. 

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:19.000
So the initial reaction is the
reaction of an electrophile, 

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.400
something that wants the
electrons. 

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:26.300
A low LUMO, the sigma-star of
HBr is the reagent that reacts 

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.467
with the double bond. 

00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:33.533
And notice that that one works
for any hydrogen halide. 

00:17:33.533 --> 00:17:36.567
Remember all the hydrogen
halides were exothermic for 

00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:38.467
their addition to the double
bond. 

00:17:38.467 --> 00:17:42.633
But only HBr would work by the
top mechanism here, the SOMO, 

00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:45.833
because both steps were
exothermic to compete with 

00:17:45.833 --> 00:17:47.933
termination. 

00:17:47.933 --> 00:17:52.067
Whereas any of the hydrogen
halides will do this stepwise 

00:17:52.067 --> 00:17:54.567
electrophilic reaction. 

00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:57.867
And notice, in this case, that
it does follow 

00:17:57.867 --> 00:17:59.167
Markovnikov's rule. 

00:17:59.167 --> 00:18:00.767
It's not that one. 

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:04.800
It's the Markovnikov, where
bromide goes to the more 

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.267
substituted carbon, and it goes
there because that carbon 

00:18:08.267 --> 00:18:10.100
is more stable in the inter... 

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:15.333
that carbon cation is more
stable as an intermediate. 

00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:20.533
So that's stuff that mostly
we've mentioned before. 

00:18:20.533 --> 00:18:23.633
Now let's think about the
orbitals and where they should 

00:18:23.633 --> 00:18:24.967
get attacked. 

00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:28.400
So here's ethylene, an alkene, 

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.900
and we can look at the surface
potential to see the energy of 

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.333
a proton on the van der Waals
surface. 

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:37.600
So a proton likes to be up above
where the double bond 

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.967
is, and it doesn't like to be
around where 

00:18:39.967 --> 00:18:42.900
the hydrogens are. 

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:48.033
So this electrostatic feature of
the surface of the molecule 

00:18:48.033 --> 00:18:51.533
is important in positioning the
fragments before they 

00:18:51.533 --> 00:18:53.000
begin to react. 

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.700
But new bonding requires mixing
orbitals, not just 

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.167
positioning things
electrostatically. 

00:19:00.767 --> 00:19:04.267
So we should look at the HOMO
and the LUMO. 

00:19:04.267 --> 00:19:10.067
So the LUMO is this pi-star
orbital and the 

00:19:10.067 --> 00:19:11.400
HOMO is the pi orbital. 

00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:16.800
So the addition, as we've said,
to alkenes is 

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.367
electrophilic, it goes after the
pi 

00:19:19.367 --> 00:19:21.367
electrons, the high HOMO. 

00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:23.900
So the proton, with its low
vacant orbital, 

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.300
electrostatically likes to be up
on top. 

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.433
That's the best place to be, if
you're on the surface of 

00:19:28.433 --> 00:19:29.567
the molecule. 

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:36.400
And when it's there, it can
overlap with this pi orbital. 

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.267
So in the various textbooks you
have, you could read about 

00:19:40.267 --> 00:19:42.200
this electrophilic addition to
alkenes. 

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.400
I guarantee you there are all
these sections in there. 

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.567
One about hydrogen halide
addition by R+, by the cation 

00:19:50.567 --> 00:19:52.167
intermediate, what we just
talked about on 

00:19:52.167 --> 00:19:53.533
the previous slide. 

00:19:53.533 --> 00:19:57.300
There'll be discussion of the
regiochemistry, which end of 

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.367
the H+ adds to, to give the more
stable cation 

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:01.533
intermediate. 

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:05.733
And there'll be discussion of
hydration, where instead of 

00:20:05.733 --> 00:20:09.500
the X minus being the thing that
adds to the H+, [correction: C+]

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:14.033
it's the solvent water, the
unshared pair on oxygen can

00:20:14.033 --> 00:20:18.300
attack the cation as well, and
then lose a proton, so that it's

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:22.033
OH that goes on instead X minus.

00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:24.167
So you can be reading that in
your texts. 

00:20:24.167 --> 00:20:30.133
And this, just to show an
example, is from the lecture 

00:20:30.133 --> 00:20:33.133
that I mentioned was given by
Professor Siegel last year, 

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:37.567
where he talks about how you can
do this Markovnikov 

00:20:37.567 --> 00:20:42.133
addition, chloride going to the
more substituted, OH going 

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:45.800
to the more substituted, Br
going to the more substituted, 

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.667
when it's clean, that is when
you don't have free radical 

00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:52.200
initiators there. 

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:57.033
So all of these form by proton
first going here to get this 

00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:59.833
more stable cation intermediate.

00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:04.033
And in this case, with dilute
sulfuric acid, it was water 

00:21:04.033 --> 00:21:07.767
that came on to do this. 

00:21:07.767 --> 00:21:10.100
And that mechanism is shown
here. 

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:15.067
Incidentally, on the exam,
remember the last question was 

00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:18.467
to draw a very careful curved
arrows and everything. 

00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:22.333
I put this up, in part, to give
you fellow feeling, 

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:24.700
because we graded that very
rigorously. 

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.733
When you draw a curved arrow to
denote electron pair 

00:21:28.733 --> 00:21:31.533
shifts, where do you start the
arrow? 

00:21:31.533 --> 00:21:33.300
STUDENT: Where the electrons
are. 

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:35.933
PROFESSOR: Where the electrons
are in the starting material. 

00:21:35.933 --> 00:21:39.233
And where do you end the point
of the arrow? 

00:21:39.233 --> 00:21:40.333
STUDENT: [INTERPOSING VOICES] 

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:42.567
PROFESSOR: Where those electrons
are in the product. 

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:46.000
Sometimes they will be on an
atom, become an anion, or 

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.933
becoming an unshared pair. 

00:21:47.933 --> 00:21:50.333
Sometimes they will be between
two atoms, because you're 

00:21:50.333 --> 00:21:52.167
forming a new bond. 

00:21:52.167 --> 00:21:55.467
And if you want to be thinking
really clearly about it, you 

00:21:55.467 --> 00:21:57.433
should draw those arrows
clearly. 

00:21:57.433 --> 00:22:00.100
That's why I asked it that way
in the question. 

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.100
But notice that Professor Siegel
here, in drawing some 

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.800
of these arrows, drew it going
on to the hydrogen. 

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.767
He drew the X minus going on to
the carbon, where I would 

00:22:10.767 --> 00:22:13.500
expect you to draw this curved
arrow ending 

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.667
between X and the carbon. 

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:18.933
And to position those two things
that are going to react 

00:22:18.933 --> 00:22:22.433
with one another in your
drawing, such that they're 

00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:25.033
close enough to one another that
it makes sense to end the 

00:22:25.033 --> 00:22:28.267
arrow between them, not to have
it off here and the arrow 

00:22:28.267 --> 00:22:31.600
terminating in space, just
because it's halfway between. 

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:36.533
So that's a lesson that I hope
will become clear. 

00:22:36.533 --> 00:22:38.800
So this shows the case of water
intervening. 

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.633
So there are sections of the
book about the addition of 

00:22:44.633 --> 00:22:47.933
hydrogen halides, about
regioselectivity, about the 

00:22:47.933 --> 00:22:51.467
intermediate cations that are
involved, about cation 

00:22:51.467 --> 00:22:54.467
stability, and about cation
rearrangements. 

00:22:54.467 --> 00:22:56.933
And I'll talk about a few of
those things here, but you can 

00:22:56.933 --> 00:23:00.300
review them in your book as
well. 

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.133
First about cation stability. 

00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:03.967
I took this from the text we
used a couple of 

00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:05.433
years ago by Loudon. 

00:23:05.433 --> 00:23:08.067
So he shows primary, secondary,
and tertiary 

00:23:08.067 --> 00:23:12.867
cations, how many carbons are
substituted on them, and says 

00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:16.567
of the stability of
carbocations, that tertiary is 

00:23:16.567 --> 00:23:19.867
more stable than secondary is
more stable than primary. 

00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:22.900
This of course is the
explanation for Markovnikov 

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.133
orientation. 

00:23:25.933 --> 00:23:29.233
Now we can look at the rationale
for that, rehearse 

00:23:29.233 --> 00:23:30.067
it once again. 

00:23:30.067 --> 00:23:35.533
Hyperconjugation says its better
to have a carbon on the 

00:23:35.533 --> 00:23:38.800
carboncation with its hydrogen,
or whatever else 

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:41.700
it's bonded to, than to have
just the hydrogen. 

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:46.400
And the reason it's better is
that there's some kind of HOMO 

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.767
that's in position to have its
electrons stabilized by that 

00:23:49.767 --> 00:23:54.467
unusually low-energy LUMO, the
one associated with the 

00:23:54.467 --> 00:23:57.267
positive charge, the vacant
orbital on carbon. 

00:23:57.267 --> 00:23:59.867
And in the case of hydrogen,
there are no electrons to be 

00:23:59.867 --> 00:24:02.967
stabilized, those are orthogonal
to this But in this 

00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:07.033
case, the sigma electrons that
are in the bond, even though 

00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:10.233
they aren't particularly high,
can interact with a really 

00:24:10.233 --> 00:24:13.967
unusually low orbital, and get
some stabilization. 

00:24:13.967 --> 00:24:17.200
So we've talked about this
before, this hyperconjugation. 

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:21.433
And it could be denoted by
writing a resonance structure, 

00:24:21.433 --> 00:24:26.067
which has a double bond between
the carbons and an H+, 

00:24:26.067 --> 00:24:29.200
or R+ if it's an R group out
there. 

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.400
The other rationale for this
order of cation stability is 

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.333
bond energies. 

00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:38.300
And we've talked about this
several times, changing CH to 

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:44.433
CC bonds when you have this
especially advantageous sp 

00:24:44.433 --> 00:24:47.533
square hybridization of the
carbon. 

00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:53.067
But those are theory, and it's
different to know what the 

00:24:53.067 --> 00:24:56.900
evidence is that they actually
have that order, tertiary more 

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.433
stable than primary. 

00:24:58.433 --> 00:25:01.367
So the first part is the
rationalization. 

00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:05.233
Now we have to say where do we
actually get the evidence that 

00:25:05.233 --> 00:25:08.067
their stability is that way? 

00:25:08.067 --> 00:25:12.400
And several people on the exam,
when asked for evidence, 

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.033
provided theory, rationale like
this, rather than actual 

00:25:17.033 --> 00:25:20.667
numbers, where the evidence
comes from. 

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:25.133
So to get evidence, you have to
compare something. 

00:25:25.133 --> 00:25:31.400
So you could compare products or
transition states, that is 

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.200
you could look at reactivity. 

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.533
If you have a very unstable
cation, you would expect it to 

00:25:37.533 --> 00:25:39.533
be more reactive. 

00:25:39.533 --> 00:25:41.900
So that would be one way that
you could do it. 

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:48.033
Another way would be compare
with a starting alkene. 

00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:52.833
If it's easier to put a proton
on, that would indicate that 

00:25:52.833 --> 00:25:55.867
the cation you're leading to is
more stable. 

00:25:55.867 --> 00:26:00.400
The cation is uphill in energy
typically, but if it's a more 

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.800
stable cation, it should be
easier to form. 

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.233
So the reactions, where you
protonate the 

00:26:06.233 --> 00:26:07.467
alkene, should be easier. 

00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:11.767
Or in the reactions we were just
talking about, the SN1 

00:26:11.767 --> 00:26:15.500
substitutions, the ease of
losing the anion, in order to 

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.167
generate the leaving group that
is to say, in order to 

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:21.167
generate the carbon cation
should be easier when the 

00:26:21.167 --> 00:26:22.733
cation is more stable. 

00:26:22.733 --> 00:26:24.600
So we could do either of those.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:32.133
Or we could directly compare the
cations with one another, 

00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:35.733
to see which one is more stable.

00:26:35.733 --> 00:26:41.600
Now here's a table taken from
the textbook, which gives a 

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.833
table of the heats of formation
of carbon cations in 

00:26:46.833 --> 00:26:47.767
the gas phase. 

00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:51.667
So they're very hard to make in
the gas phase. 

00:26:51.667 --> 00:26:56.067
And it says, "secondary vinyl
cations are more stable than 

00:26:56.067 --> 00:26:58.367
primary vinyl cations." 

00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:00.167
Now what's the basis for that
here? 

00:27:03.567 --> 00:27:06.367
In the table, what's the basis
for saying that secondary 

00:27:06.367 --> 00:27:09.633
vinyl cations are more stable
than primary vinyl cations? 

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:18.567
Well we look up there and we see
a primary vinyl cation is, 

00:27:18.567 --> 00:27:23.200
in fact, the highest energy of
any of these. 

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.833
And the secondary vinyl cation
is also pretty high. 

00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:30.733
It's substituted, it's
secondary, which 

00:27:30.733 --> 00:27:31.533
should make it better. 

00:27:31.533 --> 00:27:34.233
And indeed, it is better. 

00:27:34.233 --> 00:27:37.367
So it says it's better by 54
kilocalories per 

00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:40.533
mole, in the gas phase. 

00:27:40.533 --> 00:27:45.267
Now there's a problem with using
this table in this way. 

00:27:45.267 --> 00:27:49.533
And the problem is compared to
what? 

00:27:49.533 --> 00:27:53.700
Is this really saying that a
primary vinyl cation is more 

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.833
stable than a secondary vinyl
cation? 

00:27:57.833 --> 00:27:59.100
Compared to what? 

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:06.133
These heats of formation, what
are they compared to? 

00:28:10.533 --> 00:28:15.500
So this is the energy of the
vinyl cation compared to what? 

00:28:18.267 --> 00:28:19.433
What's the heat of formation? 

00:28:19.433 --> 00:28:20.333
Helen? 

00:28:20.333 --> 00:28:22.833
STUDENT: Carbon dioxide and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] 

00:28:22.833 --> 00:28:24.600
PROFESSOR: That's the heat of
combustion. 

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.100
It could have been heat of
combustion. 

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.900
We would add something to these,
to get heat of 

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.967
combustion. 

00:28:29.967 --> 00:28:32.333
Actually what's given is the
heat of formation. 

00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:34.600
STUDENT: Compared to the carbon
and hydrogen? 

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.733
PROFESSOR: Yeah, compared to
carbon and graphite and 

00:28:36.733 --> 00:28:39.600
hydrogen and H2 gas, at standard
temperature and 

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.967
pressure and so on. 

00:28:40.967 --> 00:28:42.567
That is compared to the
elements, in 

00:28:42.567 --> 00:28:44.133
their standard states. 

00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:48.000
But notice that there are
different numbers of atoms in 

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:48.567
these things. 

00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:51.200
They're not isomers of one
another. 

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.967
So it's not that you can convert
one to the other and 

00:28:53.967 --> 00:28:58.067
say that this heat difference
shown here 

00:28:58.067 --> 00:29:00.200
takes one to the other. 

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.100
You're comparing apples and
oranges. 

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.233
They're just not the same thing.

00:29:04.233 --> 00:29:07.733
If you want to compare with
heats of formation, they have 

00:29:07.733 --> 00:29:11.000
to be things that are isomers of
one another, where you know 

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.100
their energy relative to one
another, rather than relative 

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.233
to something completely
different, different numbers 

00:29:16.233 --> 00:29:18.500
of atoms. 

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.633
So this particular table doesn't
help you at all 

00:29:21.633 --> 00:29:25.467
directly in figuring out, except
that there might be 

00:29:25.467 --> 00:29:28.133
some cases here, like this one.

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:35.167
Notice that this is C4H9, and
this one is also C4H9. 

00:29:35.167 --> 00:29:38.800
So here's a primary and a
secondary which differ by 20 

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.233
kilocalories per mole in the gas
phase. 

00:29:41.233 --> 00:29:44.500
And that really does show that
secondary is 

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:46.367
more stable than primary. 

00:29:46.367 --> 00:29:49.100
But this table definitely
doesn't show that secondary 

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.933
vinyl cations are more stable
than primary vinyl cations. 

00:29:52.933 --> 00:29:55.700
So you have to think carefully
about compared to what. 

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.567
Here you're comparing to
different numbers of atoms in 

00:29:58.567 --> 00:30:03.367
their standard states, not
relative to each other, nor 

00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:06.200
relative to their respective
starting materials or 

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.433
products, as we talked about
last time. 

00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:12.200
So this table, in general, is
irrelevant to the question of 

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.567
cation stability in the sense
that we were talking about it 

00:30:15.567 --> 00:30:18.367
in the previous slide. 

00:30:18.367 --> 00:30:22.100
Now on the other hand, in Loudon
here, Table 4.2, gives 

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:27.200
the heats of formation of
isomeric butyl cations. 

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.733
So the same atoms, they're being
compared to the same 

00:30:29.733 --> 00:30:33.000
thing, so differences between
them now do tell us the 

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.067
difference between primary,
secondary, 

00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:36.633
and tertiary cations. 

00:30:39.167 --> 00:30:42.133
They got it from the same
numbers, heats of formation. 

00:30:42.133 --> 00:30:44.700
Although, in fact, you'll find
that these numbers are 

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.333
slightly different from those in
the previous table. 

00:30:49.333 --> 00:30:53.067
Neither book says what the
source of these numbers is. 

00:30:53.067 --> 00:30:56.600
These NIST values have been
pretty carefully gone through. 

00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.600
So if push comes to shove, I
often look at those, or ask 

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.400
Professor Wiberg what the best
value is. 

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:08.633
But here you see that the
relative energy of the 

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:13.733
tertiary butyl cation is taken
as zero, the most stable. 

00:31:13.733 --> 00:31:16.867
And now the others are 16 or 32
or 37 

00:31:16.867 --> 00:31:20.067
kilocalories less stable. 

00:31:20.067 --> 00:31:23.933
So tertiary is more stable than
secondary is more stable 

00:31:23.933 --> 00:31:24.967
than primary. 

00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:28.533
And here are two different
primaries. 

00:31:28.533 --> 00:31:32.700
Now if we look at those two, we
see that going from primary 

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:38.567
to secondary is a difference of
21 kilocalories per mole. 

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:43.833
37 to 16, primary is less stable
by 21 

00:31:43.833 --> 00:31:47.267
kilocalories per mole. 

00:31:47.267 --> 00:31:52.333
Now remember that the reason for
this could be things like 

00:31:52.333 --> 00:31:56.200
hyperconjugation, or the number
of carbons bonded to 

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:01.233
the sp squared carbon, the same
factors that we talked 

00:32:01.233 --> 00:32:04.700
about in the case of alkenes,
making more substituted 

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.333
alkenes more stable. 

00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:09.200
Here more substituted cations
are more stable. 

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.700
But the difference is much
bigger here. 

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.300
21 kilocalories per mole versus
two and a half 

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.100
kilocalories per mole, from the
slope of that plot we made 

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.667
for the alkenes at the beginning
of the lecture. 

00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:24.333
So it's ever so much more
important for cations than it 

00:32:24.333 --> 00:32:28.667
is for alkenes, whatever the
factor is that's doing this. 

00:32:28.667 --> 00:32:30.733
So it could be hyperconjugation.

00:32:30.733 --> 00:32:34.333
Would you expect that to be more
stable, more important 

00:32:34.333 --> 00:32:38.300
for the cations shown here, or
for the alkenes, where the 

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.633
carbon is a carbon-carbon double
bond? 

00:32:40.633 --> 00:32:44.467
You have the same factor, that
the carbon carbon double bond 

00:32:44.467 --> 00:32:47.133
here would have a low LUMO. 

00:32:47.133 --> 00:32:50.067
This has that p orbital on
carbon. 

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:53.567
That has a pi-star orbital, a
low LUMO, and 

00:32:53.567 --> 00:32:56.367
the same deal here. 

00:32:56.367 --> 00:33:00.800
Would you expect the effect of
that mixing, HOMO-LUMO mixing 

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.733
in hyperconjugation, to be the
same as when you 

00:33:04.733 --> 00:33:06.000
have a double bond? 

00:33:11.567 --> 00:33:15.300
If one stabilization is bigger
than the other, which? 

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:20.933
So here we have the electrons in
a sigma bond. 

00:33:20.933 --> 00:33:23.033
And here we have a vacant
orbital. 

00:33:23.033 --> 00:33:26.767
In the case of the cation, we
have just a vacant p orbital. 

00:33:26.767 --> 00:33:31.667
In the case of the double bond,
we have pi-star orbital, 

00:33:31.667 --> 00:33:33.300
plus minus. 

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.200
Which one's going to give more 

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.100
stabilization of these
electrons? 

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.567
What determines it? 

00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:44.733
What determines how much
stabilization you get out of 

00:33:44.733 --> 00:33:47.367
mixing orbitals? 

00:33:47.367 --> 00:33:48.300
Megan? 

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:49.233
STUDENT: Overlap? 

00:33:49.233 --> 00:33:51.900
PROFESSOR: Overlap is one thing.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.100
So it's a p orbital on carbon in
either case here. 

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:57.833
In one case, that p orbital is
also associated 

00:33:57.833 --> 00:33:59.867
with another p orbital. 

00:33:59.867 --> 00:34:02.233
So each of them is 1 over the
square root of 2. 

00:34:02.233 --> 00:34:03.967
So it's smaller in one case. 

00:34:03.967 --> 00:34:08.867
So there indeed would be less
overlap in the case of the 

00:34:08.867 --> 00:34:11.500
carbon-carbon double bond,
rather than just a full 

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.933
fledged p orbital. 

00:34:12.933 --> 00:34:14.000
So that's one factor. 

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.567
How about another factor, Megan?

00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:16.867
STUDENT: Energy? 

00:34:16.867 --> 00:34:19.300
PROFESSOR: How about the energy
match? 

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.267
STUDENT: When you have a
positive charge 

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:23.700
it raises the energy. 

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.367
PROFESSOR: Think about that
carefully. 

00:34:26.367 --> 00:34:27.833
Say it again. 

00:34:27.833 --> 00:34:28.800
STUDENT: It lowers the energy? 

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.367
PROFESSOR: The positive charge
makes the energy fabulously 

00:34:31.367 --> 00:34:33.267
low for the cation. 

00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:37.400
The pi-star is low, compared to
sigma-star But it's not 

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.700
really all that low, compared to
the vacant orbital. 

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.867
So both on the basis of overlap,
and on the basis of 

00:34:43.867 --> 00:34:47.033
energy match, you expect a much
bigger factor for the 

00:34:47.033 --> 00:34:48.633
cation than you do for the
alkene. 

00:34:48.633 --> 00:34:50.067
And in fact, that's what you
see. 

00:34:50.067 --> 00:34:51.567
It's worth a heck of a lot more.

00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:57.500
But the bond energy factor might
be more or less similar 

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.600
between the two, because in both
cases, you're changing CH 

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.733
to C-C single bonds. 

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.967
But this is the one that should
make a really big 

00:35:04.967 --> 00:35:05.633
difference. 

00:35:05.633 --> 00:35:09.667
But there's another factor as
well, actually, which is that 

00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:11.867
these are measured in the gas
phase. 

00:35:14.433 --> 00:35:16.300
So we have this positively
charged 

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:19.233
carbon in the gas phase. 

00:35:19.233 --> 00:35:23.567
We saw, when we talked about the
ionization of water, how 

00:35:23.567 --> 00:35:29.133
much effect solvation has on the
ability to form ions. 

00:35:29.133 --> 00:35:33.367
So here we're trying to form an
ion on this carbon. 

00:35:33.367 --> 00:35:40.833
Can you see another difference
among these, about 

00:35:40.833 --> 00:35:46.467
stabilization by this positive
charge, other than 

00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:49.600
hyperconjugation and bond
energy? 

00:35:52.833 --> 00:35:53.400
Nathan? 

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.267
STUDENT: The top one's more
polarizable. 

00:35:56.267 --> 00:35:56.833
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:35:56.833 --> 00:35:59.833
The other stuff in the molecule,
the other three 

00:35:59.833 --> 00:36:04.533
carbon atoms and their
hydrogens, are polarizable. 

00:36:04.533 --> 00:36:08.000
But remember, there's a very
strong distance dependence. 

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.400
You have to be really close to
get a lot of 

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.033
advantage out of that. 

00:36:12.033 --> 00:36:16.033
So with t-butyl, you have all
the other atoms really close 

00:36:16.033 --> 00:36:21.833
to the positive charge to be
stabilized by polarization. 

00:36:21.833 --> 00:36:25.167
Here you have that one much
further away. 

00:36:25.167 --> 00:36:28.633
Here you have two of them
significantly further away. 

00:36:28.633 --> 00:36:31.200
And here you have this one
significantly further away, 

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.900
and this one off in left field.

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:38.033
So we can see that there's going
to be "intramolecular 

00:36:38.033 --> 00:36:42.267
solvation" you might call it,
but nobody else calls it that. 

00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:45.867
But this effect from
polarizability in the gas 

00:36:45.867 --> 00:36:47.800
phase is going to be very
important. 

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:52.200
But if you go into solution,
it's just the reverse. 

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:58.933
Because the primary one up here
has the positive charge 

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:00.500
very exposed. 

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.267
So neighboring molecules could
get very close to that. 

00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:09.533
So in the gas phase, it's the
atoms within the molecule that 

00:37:09.533 --> 00:37:13.200
are solvating the positive
charge, and their electrons 

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.667
being stabilized. 

00:37:14.667 --> 00:37:17.200
But if you go into regular
solution, it turns around. 

00:37:20.667 --> 00:37:25.700
So these differences in the gas
phase are much bigger than 

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.167
the effects that you would
actually see in a solution 

00:37:28.167 --> 00:37:34.267
reaction, where the primary
cations are more stabilized by 

00:37:34.267 --> 00:37:35.933
the surrounding molecules. 

00:37:35.933 --> 00:37:40.467
So for example, if you do SN1
reaction, t-butyl bromide is 

00:37:40.467 --> 00:37:45.333
only about 5 kilocalories per
mole easier to ionize than 

00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:47.067
isopropyl bromide. 

00:37:47.067 --> 00:37:49.067
That we saw in that-- 

00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:54.100
remember where methyl, ethyl,
isopropyl t-butyl. 

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.400
t-Butyl was unusually easy to
substitute, 

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.267
because it went by SN1. 

00:38:01.267 --> 00:38:05.900
But if you looked at the
isopropyl, it also was going 

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.700
partly by SN1. 

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.900
And it turns out that it's about
5 kilocalories harder 

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.300
for isopropyl. 

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:19.267
But here the difference between
t-butyl and the 

00:38:19.267 --> 00:38:20.900
isopropyl-- 

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.167
the equivalent of isopropyl-- 

00:38:24.967 --> 00:38:30.733
is 16 kilocalories per mole, or
even more. 

00:38:30.733 --> 00:38:34.967
So it's very strongly attenuated
in solution. 

00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:40.967
People often talk about gas
phase being intrinsic values 

00:38:40.967 --> 00:38:44.167
for things you can measure, like
the heats of formation of 

00:38:44.167 --> 00:38:46.367
these things, that that's the
ideal. 

00:38:46.367 --> 00:38:48.767
The reason it's ideal is you can
compare it with 

00:38:48.767 --> 00:38:50.467
calculation. 

00:38:50.467 --> 00:38:52.933
But it's not an ideal reference
if what you're 

00:38:52.933 --> 00:38:56.200
interested in is predicting
reactions in solution, where 

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.367
that solvation is going to make
a lot of difference. 

00:39:01.533 --> 00:39:07.600
Now here's addition of HCl to an
alkene. 

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.300
So is this Markovnikov or
anti-Markovnikov addition? 

00:39:20.867 --> 00:39:24.700
Natalie, do you remember what
Markovnikov and 

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.200
anti-Markovnikov means? 

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.700
STUDENT: Your anion goes to the
more substituted-- 

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.567
PROFESSOR: Does the anion, the
non-hydrogen thing, go to the 

00:39:33.567 --> 00:39:37.400
more substituted carbon in this
case? 

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.333
Yeah, it did. 

00:39:38.333 --> 00:39:39.167
And why? 

00:39:39.167 --> 00:39:42.400
Of course, what we would expect
is that it would be 

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.800
attacked, and this would give
the more substituted cation, 

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.767
rather than attacking the
central carbon, and having the 

00:39:49.767 --> 00:39:52.533
primary cation as the
intermediate. 

00:39:52.533 --> 00:39:56.733
Then chloride goes over and
forms a new bond, and you have 

00:39:56.733 --> 00:39:57.600
the product. 

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.433
So that's Markovnikov addition.

00:40:01.433 --> 00:40:04.033
However that's only 17% of the
product. 

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.767
The 83% of the product is that.

00:40:16.233 --> 00:40:18.467
Can anybody see what's funny
about that product? 

00:40:18.467 --> 00:40:22.400
Is that the anti-Markovnikov
addition? 

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:23.333
Natalie? 

00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:27.167
STUDENT: No, it's also just as
equally substituted-- 

00:40:27.167 --> 00:40:28.633
PROFESSOR: I can't hear very
well. 

00:40:28.633 --> 00:40:31.233
STUDENT: That carbon is equally
substituted as in the 

00:40:31.233 --> 00:40:32.533
first case. 

00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:34.733
PROFESSOR: Ah, the substitution
of 

00:40:34.733 --> 00:40:37.467
the carbons is different. 

00:40:37.467 --> 00:40:38.733
What has happened? 

00:40:42.033 --> 00:40:44.933
We saw this before. 

00:40:44.933 --> 00:40:45.400
Chris? 

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.833
STUDENT: A methyl shift. 

00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:48.333
PROFESSOR: A methyl has shifted.

00:40:48.333 --> 00:40:49.100
It's rearranged. 

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:54.067
In fact, what shifts is a methyl
group, but it's a 

00:40:54.067 --> 00:40:57.233
methyl with its electrons. 

00:40:57.233 --> 00:41:02.100
It's a methide shift when you're
talking about cations, 

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.333
as you will see here. 

00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:08.300
So it's shifted a methyl across,
so what's happened is 

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.800
that those electrons--it's like
hyperconjugation, that 

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.000
those sigma electrons are
stabilized by the vacant 

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.400
orbital on the carbon. 

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.267
But they're stabilized so much
that the methyl with its 

00:41:21.267 --> 00:41:23.733
electrons, with those bonding
electrons, the 

00:41:23.733 --> 00:41:25.833
methide, shifts across. 

00:41:29.733 --> 00:41:33.067
If you want to have fun,
sometimes when you draw a 

00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:35.800
rearrangement, you draw a little
loop in the arrow, 

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.100
isn't that cute? 

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:41.633
So the methide has shifted
across to give this more 

00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:44.633
stable cation, this was
secondary, this one is 

00:41:44.633 --> 00:41:50.900
tertiary, and then that gives
83% of the product. 

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.833
So what this says is that the
rearrangement, the methide 

00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:59.800
shift, competes with reaction,
with the collapse of the ions, 

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.600
chloride attacking the positive
carbon. 

00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:08.833
So both things happen, and they
have similar rates. 

00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:14.900
Now suppose you had a lot of
some other nucleophile there, 

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.933
like water. 

00:42:16.933 --> 00:42:20.400
Now the unshared pair of water
could fill the role that 

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:26.967
chloride filled here, then lose
protons, so you got H2O+, 

00:42:26.967 --> 00:42:28.500
then it loses a proton. 

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:31.600
So you can get this alcohol, or
you can get 

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.700
the rearranged alcohol. 

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.633
So the fact of this
rearrangement is, of course, 

00:42:36.633 --> 00:42:39.967
additional evidence that you had
the cation intermediate as 

00:42:39.967 --> 00:42:45.833
it was in SN1 reactions, where
the rearranged skeleton showed 

00:42:45.833 --> 00:42:47.400
that there'd been a cation
intermediate. 

00:42:51.033 --> 00:42:58.400
So when you do acid-catalyzed
hydration of a double bond, 

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:03.200
adding H and OH, you have to be
aware that there's the 

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.800
possibility of rearrangement. 

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:08.967
If the skeleton is one where you
would form one cation, but 

00:43:08.967 --> 00:43:14.133
then a methide shift, or a
hydride shift, could give a 

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:16.933
more stable one. 

00:43:16.933 --> 00:43:18.767
Now let's look at the influence
of 

00:43:18.767 --> 00:43:23.333
halogen in these cations. 

00:43:23.333 --> 00:43:29.133
So here we start with acetylene
and add HCl. 

00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:34.200
So we've started to give the
more substituted vinyl cation. 

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.533
Remember the table, it said
primary vinyl cations are less 

00:43:38.533 --> 00:43:42.767
stable than secondary vinyl
cations, even though the data 

00:43:42.767 --> 00:43:45.533
was not the appropriate data to
support that, it's 

00:43:45.533 --> 00:43:50.600
absolutely true that vinyl
cations are very hard to make. 

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.333
So this is not such an easy
process. 

00:43:53.333 --> 00:44:00.200
But then it can add chloride, so
you have this product, 

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.300
which is the Markovnikov
product. 

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.233
The proton added to the terminal
carbon to make the 

00:44:06.233 --> 00:44:09.467
more stable secondary, rather
than adding to the central 

00:44:09.467 --> 00:44:12.500
carbon to make the less stable
primary cation, so the 

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.267
chloride ends up there. 

00:44:14.267 --> 00:44:17.433
And this is perfectly
reasonable. 

00:44:17.433 --> 00:44:20.933
But it went by way of this
unstable vinyl cation. 

00:44:20.933 --> 00:44:25.233
So it turns out that this
addition, this kind of 

00:44:25.233 --> 00:44:31.833
electrophilic addition to
alkenes, is 100 to 1,000 times 

00:44:31.833 --> 00:44:35.800
slower than it-- 

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.467
to alkynes is 100 to 1,000 times
slower than to alkenes. 

00:44:40.467 --> 00:44:43.400
It's much harder to add to
triple bonds than to double 

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:47.833
bonds, because you get these
unfavorable vinyl cation 

00:44:47.833 --> 00:44:49.167
intermediates. 

00:44:49.167 --> 00:44:51.033
Well fine. 

00:44:51.033 --> 00:44:52.667
But now we have a double bond. 

00:44:56.367 --> 00:44:59.867
We have Markovnikov
regiochemistry, but if you 

00:44:59.867 --> 00:45:05.533
have excess HCl, you can add it
again, and get a second 

00:45:05.533 --> 00:45:07.200
Markovnikov addition. 

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.767
Now suppose you didn't have an
excess of HCl. 

00:45:15.767 --> 00:45:18.333
Suppose you just had one
equivalent of HCl. 

00:45:21.233 --> 00:45:24.700
What product would you expect to
get? 

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:25.500
Jack? 

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.467
STUDENT: Still that. 

00:45:26.467 --> 00:45:26.967
PROFESSOR: Pardon? 

00:45:26.967 --> 00:45:27.433
STUDENT: Still that. 

00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:28.633
PROFESSOR: Why still that? 

00:45:28.633 --> 00:45:32.367
STUDENT: Because the double bond
is easier to attack. 

00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:34.500
PROFESSOR: Ah! The double bond
is easier to attack than the 

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.500
triple bond. 

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.700
So if you didn't have enough
HCl, still this would be much 

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:40.933
more reactive than this. 

00:45:40.933 --> 00:45:44.800
After you form any of that, it
will be reacting 100 to 1,000 

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.267
times faster per molecule than
that did. 

00:45:48.267 --> 00:45:50.167
So you're still going to get
this product. 

00:45:50.167 --> 00:45:51.433
Jack's right. 

00:45:55.233 --> 00:45:59.300
Under certain conditions, these
are the yield you got. 

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.700
It was 56% and 44%. 

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.333
I suspect that if the reaction
had been carried on longer, 

00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:09.333
you would do what Jack did, well
you'd 

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:10.933
go all the way there. 

00:46:10.933 --> 00:46:14.700
But under certain conditions at
least, the reaction was 

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.600
interrupted, and that was the
product distribution. 

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.033
Now it went obviously by way of
this cation intermediate, 

00:46:23.033 --> 00:46:28.633
the second step, protonated to
give this substituted cation. 

00:46:28.633 --> 00:46:34.867
Now we have a question: is the
halogen, as a substituent, 

00:46:34.867 --> 00:46:38.267
favorable or unfavorable for
purposes 

00:46:38.267 --> 00:46:39.533
of forming the cation? 

00:46:50.433 --> 00:46:51.767
Jack help us out here. 

00:46:55.467 --> 00:46:59.167
Was this second step what you
expected to 

00:46:59.167 --> 00:47:00.500
be in terms of rate? 

00:47:05.867 --> 00:47:07.333
STUDENT: No. 

00:47:07.333 --> 00:47:09.833
PROFESSOR: Is it unusually fast
or unusually slow 

00:47:09.833 --> 00:47:13.300
compared to what you expected? 

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.800
STUDENT: Slow? 

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.300
PROFESSOR: Fast? 

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.267
Slow? 

00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:19.133
What did you say before? 

00:47:19.133 --> 00:47:21.300
This should react 100 to 1,000--

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.600
being a double bond-- 

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.667
should react 100 to 1,000 times
faster than this. 

00:47:25.667 --> 00:47:29.267
Did it react 100 to 1,000
faster? 

00:47:29.267 --> 00:47:29.700
STUDENT: No. 

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.167
PROFESSOR: No. 

00:47:30.167 --> 00:47:35.333
It didn't react any faster at
all, or roughly the same. 

00:47:35.333 --> 00:47:41.233
So for some reason this was
slowed down by some several 

00:47:41.233 --> 00:47:43.667
powers of 10. 

00:47:43.667 --> 00:47:46.300
What could've slowed it down? 

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.467
STUDENT: The chlorine could've
stabilized the cation. 

00:47:49.467 --> 00:47:52.100
PROFESSOR: Because of the
chlorine, it could be hard to 

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.733
get a cation. 

00:47:53.733 --> 00:47:55.333
Would that make sense to you? 

00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:56.300
Why? 

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.800
STUDENT: Because the chlorine
has 

00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.267
electrons that can overlap. 

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.933
PROFESSOR: The question is how
hard is it going to be to form 

00:48:04.933 --> 00:48:08.800
this cation, which we did by
putting a 

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.667
proton on that carbon. 

00:48:10.667 --> 00:48:14.367
The alkene carbon gets a proton
gets that cation. 

00:48:14.367 --> 00:48:16.733
So is it harder? 

00:48:16.733 --> 00:48:18.000
Sebastian, what do you say? 

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.200
What effect do you think the
chlorine had? 

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.700
STUDENT: The electron induction
pulls the electron 

00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:27.700
away from-- 

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.300
PROFESSOR: The sigma bond is
electron withdrawing. 

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:35.000
The electrons around the carbon
are lower in energy 

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.133
because they've been sucked away
by the chloride, so it's 

00:48:38.133 --> 00:48:41.233
harder to form the cation. 

00:48:41.233 --> 00:48:46.100
That would explain why we get
this ratio here. 

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.533
That this second step, even
though it's an alkene and 

00:48:48.533 --> 00:48:52.067
should be enormously faster, is
not any faster, because 

00:48:52.067 --> 00:48:53.767
this chlorine is slowing it down
by 

00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:55.267
pulling electrons away. 

00:48:55.267 --> 00:48:58.267
It can't provide electrons to
the proton. 

00:48:58.267 --> 00:49:00.233
Now Sebastian, keep going for
us. 

00:49:00.233 --> 00:49:01.733
How about the regiochemistry? 

00:49:04.767 --> 00:49:08.200
So the second step is slow,
that's what we were just 

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.400
talking about. 

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:14.233
How about the regiochemistry of
the second step? 

00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:18.833
That is, is it Markovnikov or
anti-Markovnikov? 

00:49:18.833 --> 00:49:23.000
That is, the proton could have
added here, to give this 

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.933
cation, or it could have added
to the central carbon to give 

00:49:26.933 --> 00:49:28.567
the other cation. 

00:49:28.567 --> 00:49:29.767
Which did it do? 

00:49:29.767 --> 00:49:32.900
Did the new chlorine go on the
more substituted or the less 

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:33.300
substituted? 

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.033
STUDENT: On the more
substituted. 

00:49:35.033 --> 00:49:36.867
PROFESSOR: On the more
substituted. 

00:49:36.867 --> 00:49:42.767
So the chlorine slows it down,
but it's still Markovnikov. 

00:49:42.767 --> 00:49:45.967
This cation is better to get
then the other cation. 

00:49:49.533 --> 00:49:53.733
STUDENT: It reacts better with
the chlorine. 

00:49:53.733 --> 00:49:57.100
PROFESSOR: Now you might say,
aha. 

00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:00.567
The choice here is between a
secondary, whatever the 

00:50:00.567 --> 00:50:02.267
chlorine is, and a primary. 

00:50:02.267 --> 00:50:04.900
And primaries are bad to get,
you don't want to protonate 

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.800
the center one, because it would
be a primary cation. 

00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:14.367
But notice here with HBr, when
it's symmetrical. 

00:50:14.367 --> 00:50:16.933
Still the two bromines go to the
same place. 

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:23.400
So that it looks like the
chlorine is welcoming the 

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.967
formation of a cation. 

00:50:25.967 --> 00:50:28.867
Or at least the bromine, in this
case, is welcoming 

00:50:28.867 --> 00:50:33.433
formation of that cation, rather
than that cation in adding 

00:50:33.433 --> 00:50:35.600
the second proton. 

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:37.067
So the answer is yes. 

00:50:40.167 --> 00:50:42.367
Is it favorable or unfavorable?

00:50:42.367 --> 00:50:45.133
It's both. 

00:50:45.133 --> 00:50:48.900
It's hard to make the cation
because of this sigma electron 

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:49.800
withdrawal. 

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:55.467
But if you form the cation,
where do you want to form it? 

00:50:55.467 --> 00:50:56.600
Next to the chlorine. 

00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:58.833
Why? 

00:50:58.833 --> 00:51:01.367
Chris, do you have an idea? 

00:51:01.367 --> 00:51:06.200
If you're forced to make a
cation, say in this case when 

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.933
you put that second bromine in,
you could've made the 

00:51:07.933 --> 00:51:10.067
cation either here or here. 

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:13.433
Both of them with respect to the
carbon would be secondary, 

00:51:13.433 --> 00:51:16.067
but this one, the one you
actually form, where the 

00:51:16.067 --> 00:51:20.367
bromide comes in has a bromine
on it. 

00:51:20.367 --> 00:51:24.933
It's hard to form it because the
sigma bonds are electron 

00:51:24.933 --> 00:51:25.567
withdrawing. 

00:51:25.567 --> 00:51:28.167
But if you form it, form it next
to the bromine. 

00:51:28.167 --> 00:51:28.800
Why? 

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.700
STUDENT: It's polarizable, so it
makes 

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.533
it even more effective. 

00:51:31.533 --> 00:51:33.167
PROFESSOR: Polarizability is a
good point. 

00:51:33.167 --> 00:51:34.933
That wasn't what I was thinking
of, 

00:51:34.933 --> 00:51:36.233
but it's a good point. 

00:51:36.233 --> 00:51:37.633
What else? 

00:51:37.633 --> 00:51:39.000
STUDENT: Lone pairs on the
halogen. 

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.100
PROFESSOR: Lone pairs on the
halogen can be stabilized by 

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:45.233
overlapping, so you get
resonance stabilization. 

00:51:45.233 --> 00:51:48.567
So if you're going to make it,
make it where you can get help 

00:51:48.567 --> 00:51:50.333
in the pi system. 

00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:51.733
So that's really, I think, 

00:51:51.733 --> 00:51:54.333
interesting about the halogens.

00:51:54.333 --> 00:51:58.067
That they could be deactivating,
but still want 

00:51:58.067 --> 00:52:00.600
to have the cation next to them,
because of the different 

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:04.333
role of the sigma electrons, and
the pi electrons. 

00:52:04.333 --> 00:52:07.233
OK, thanks for sticking around
here.

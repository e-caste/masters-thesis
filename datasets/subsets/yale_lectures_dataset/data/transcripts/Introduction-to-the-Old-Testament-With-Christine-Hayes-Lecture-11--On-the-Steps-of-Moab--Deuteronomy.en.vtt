00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.218
Professor Christine
Hayes: You may have heard

00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:07.259
that post-biblical tradition
hails Moses as ancient Israel's

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.710
first and greatest law giver;
and certainly the Bible depicts

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.759
Moses as receiving law from God
and conveying it to the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.218
Israelites.
But clearly Moses isn't the

00:00:16.218 --> 00:00:19.803
author or compiler of the legal
traditions contained in the

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:22.166
Bible.
Some of the individual laws we

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:25.416
know are found in very,
very, very Ancient Near Eastern

00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:29.330
laws: they're part of an Ancient
Near Eastern legal tradition.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.104
The collections as a whole
clearly date to a much later

00:00:32.104 --> 00:00:35.341
period of time--and we're going
to see that clearly when we talk

00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.372
about Deuteronomy today--and
they have been retrojected back

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:39.760
to the time of Moses.
 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.471
But nevertheless,
Moses is the central figure in

00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:45.586
the biblical narrative,
from Exodus all the way through

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:47.490
Numbers and into Deuteronomy.
 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.716
And he's going to serve as a
paradigm for Israel's leaders to

00:00:51.716 --> 00:00:54.856
follow.
In the biblical view no one can

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:58.980
look upon the face of God and
live, and yet Moses,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.583
who spoke with God "mouth to
mouth," the text says,

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:04.890
was an exception to this rule.
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.367
So why wasn't he permitted to
see the fulfillment of his

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:12.036
labors?
Why was he not permitted to

00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:13.829
enter the Promised Land?
 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.080
This is a question that plagued
ancient Israel,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.037
and the Bible contains the
effort of tradition to explain

00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:23.510
this great mystery,
or tragedy.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.774
When Moses asks God if he can
enter the land--that's in

00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:32.196
Deuteronomy 3:25--God refuses,
and he gives his reason in

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:35.451
Deuteronomy 32:49-52:
You shall die on the

00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:38.315
mountain that you are about to
ascend, and shall be gathered to

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:40.575
your kin,
as your brother Aaron died on

00:01:40.575 --> 00:01:42.870
Mount Hor and was gathered to
his kin;

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.633
for you both broke faith with
Me among the Israelite people,

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:49.056
at the waters of
Meribath-kadesh in the

00:01:49.056 --> 00:01:52.096
wilderness of Zin,
by failing to uphold My

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:54.730
sanctity among the Israelite
people.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.600
You may view the land from a
distance, but you shall not

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.262
enter it--the land that I am
giving to the Israelite

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:02.544
people.
So what happened at

00:02:02.544 --> 00:02:05.480
Meribath-kadesh that made God so
angry?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.795
Well you can read the story,
it's in Numbers 20,

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:09.469
the incident is described
there.

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.629
But the answer is still not
entirely clear,

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.611
it's not clear what Moses did
that was so bad as to deserve

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.447
this punishment.
Perhaps it's Moses' failure to

00:02:17.447 --> 00:02:21.001
follow God's instructions to the
letter when he is producing

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.591
water for the Israelites or
demanding water:

00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:25.759
perhaps that's what angers God.
 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.558
But one gets the impression
that the story in Numbers 20 and

00:02:29.558 --> 00:02:33.549
Deuteronomy's subsequent claim
that it was something about that

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.639
story that earned Moses God's
disapproval...

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.066
you get the impression that
these are an attempt to explain

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:43.729
what was probably a longstanding
tradition about a great leader

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.270
who died on the east side of the
river.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.645
For that to have happened,
for that death to have happened

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:50.770
the writers seem to surmise,
he must have sinned;

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.800
there must have been some
punishment for some sin.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.019
After a very poignant scene in
which God shows Moses the

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.419
Promised Land,
from a lookout point on the

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.841
east side of the Jordan River,
we then read about the death of

00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:07.455
Moses in Deuteronomy 34:
God spoke to Moses on

00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:09.893
that same day.
"Ascend this Mount Abarim,

00:03:09.893 --> 00:03:12.418
the peak Nebo,
in the land of Moab opposite

00:03:12.418 --> 00:03:14.275
Jericho,
and look at the Land of Canaan

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:15.910
which I am giving Israel for a
holding."

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.287
..
So Moses went up from the

00:03:18.287 --> 00:03:20.909
plains of Moab to Mount Nebo to
the top of Pisgah,

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:21.979
opposite Jericho.
 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.264
And God showed him all the
land, from Gilead to Dan [which

00:03:25.264 --> 00:03:27.877
is in the north],
and all of Naphtali and the

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:31.249
land of Ephraim and Manasseh,
and all of Judah [in the south]

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.692
to the outer Mediterranean Sea;
and the Negev [the southern

00:03:34.692 --> 00:03:36.926
wilderness];
and the Plain of the Valley of

00:03:36.926 --> 00:03:39.571
Jericho, the Palm City,
as far as Zoar [the end of the

00:03:39.571 --> 00:03:41.199
Dead Sea].
...

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.489
Then Moses the servant of God
died there, in the land of Moab,

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.927
as God had said,
and he buried him in the

00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:49.923
valley, in the land of
Moab...but no man knows the

00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:52.520
place of his burial,
to this day.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.815
And the people of Israel wept
for Moses in the Plains of Moab

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:59.056
for thirty days...and there
never again arose in Israel such

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:01.777
a prophet as Moses,
whom God knew face to face,

00:04:01.777 --> 00:04:05.124
none like him for all the signs
and wonders which the Lord sent

00:04:05.124 --> 00:04:08.537
him to do in the land of Egypt,
to Pharaoh, to his household

00:04:08.537 --> 00:04:11.151
and to all his land;
none like him in respect of all

00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:13.828
the mighty power and all the
great and terrible deeds which

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:15.675
Moses wrought in the sight of
all Israel.

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:18.994
[Hayes translation]
There's no other human being in

00:04:18.994 --> 00:04:21.240
the Bible who earns such a
tribute.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.281
This is unusual for the
biblical writer to speak in such

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:28.000
glowing terms of a human
character.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.380
I said that Moses becomes a
paradigmatic leader in the

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.720
biblical tradition.
 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.001
And the force of Moses as
paradigmatic leader of Israel is

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:38.765
apparent in the very first
leader to succeed him,

00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:40.089
and that is Joshua.
 

00:04:40.089 --> 00:04:44.608
Deuteronomy closes with a
transfer of authority from Moses

00:04:44.608 --> 00:04:47.568
to Joshua.
So in Deuteronomy 34:9 we read,

00:04:47.568 --> 00:04:51.325
"Now Joshua son of Nun was
filled with the spirit of wisdom

00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:54.240
because Moses had laid his hands
upon him;

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.786
and the Israelites heeded him,
doing as the Lord had commanded

00:04:57.786 --> 00:05:00.013
Moses."
And in several ways Joshua's

00:05:00.013 --> 00:05:03.420
going to turn out to be a kind
of carbon copy of Moses.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.653
Moses crosses the Reed Sea,
the waters stand in a heap,

00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:11.730
and the children of Israel
cross over on dry land.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.418
We'll see in connection with
Joshua that he crosses the

00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:16.310
Jordan River into the Promised
Land,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.805
the waters stand in a heap,
the children of Israel cross on

00:05:20.805 --> 00:05:23.439
dry land--that's in Joshua 3:13.
 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.789
After crossing,
the Israelites then celebrate

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.909
the Passover,
and that makes a strong link

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:34.791
then to the Exodus led by Moses,
also at the time of the first

00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:37.155
Passover.
Moses had a vision of God at

00:05:37.155 --> 00:05:38.199
the burning bush.
 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.938
He was told to remove his
shoes, his sandals,

00:05:40.938 --> 00:05:42.930
because he was on holy ground.
 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.211
Joshua is also going to have a
theophany--that's a

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.980
vision--after he crosses the
Jordan.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.371
He'll see a man with a drawn
sword who's the captain of the

00:05:50.371 --> 00:05:53.178
Lord's host and he tells him to
remove his shoes,

00:05:53.178 --> 00:05:54.639
he is on holy ground.
 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.882
Moses is the one to mediate a
covenant between God and Israel

00:05:58.882 --> 00:06:01.347
at Sinai.
Joshua will mediate a renewal

00:06:01.347 --> 00:06:03.850
of the covenant at a place
called Shechem.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.589
Moses sent out spies to scout
out the land;

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.779
Joshua also sent out spies to
scout out the land.

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:13.206
Moses holds out a rod during
battle in order that Israel

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.446
prevail over her enemies,
and Joshua will do the same

00:06:16.446 --> 00:06:19.214
with a javelin.
So these are all important

00:06:19.214 --> 00:06:22.688
literary parallels and they
signal the importance of Moses

00:06:22.688 --> 00:06:25.980
in Israelite tradition,
as the paradigmatic leader;

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.135
so other leaders who are
praised will be modeled on

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:31.048
Moses.
It's said of Joshua after the

00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:33.329
Israelites enter the Promised
Land, it's said,

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:36.301
"On that day the Lord exalted
Joshua in the sight of all

00:06:36.301 --> 00:06:39.705
Israel so that they revered him
all his days as they had revered

00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:41.945
Moses."
So no greater praise can be

00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:45.540
given to an Israelite leader
than to be compared to Moses.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.517
But now we're going to take a
close look at Deuteronomy and

00:06:49.517 --> 00:06:52.329
we'll pick up with Joshua on
Wednesday.

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:56.098
So Israel's wanderings in the
wilderness end on the Plains of

00:06:56.098 --> 00:06:59.490
Moab, which is on the east bank
of the Jordan River,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.589
and it's there that the book of
Deuteronomy opens.

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.841
There Moses is going to deliver
three long speeches prior to the

00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:08.060
Israelites' entry into the
Promised Land,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.918
and these three speeches
constitute the bulk of the book

00:07:12.918 --> 00:07:16.325
of Deuteronomy.
So Deuteronomy differs very

00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:20.417
much from the other four books
of the Pentateuch because in

00:07:20.417 --> 00:07:24.298
those books you have an
anonymous narrator who describes

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:28.532
Yahweh as directing his words to
Moses to then be conveyed to

00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:31.711
Israel.
Moses will speak to Israel on

00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:34.638
God's behalf.
But in Deuteronomy Moses is

00:07:34.638 --> 00:07:38.999
going to be speaking directly to
the Israelites so that the book

00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:42.459
is written almost entirely in
the first person,

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:44.329
whereas the first four books of
the Pentateuch are not;

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:46.940
they are third person anonymous
narrative, narration.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.588
Here we have the bulk of the
book in the first person:

00:07:50.588 --> 00:07:53.363
direct speech.
Now Moshe Weinfeld--I've put

00:07:53.363 --> 00:07:57.129
his name on the board as someone
who you should associate always

00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:59.878
with the book of
Deuteronomy--Moshe Weinfeld is

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:03.584
one of the leading scholars of
Deuteronomy and he describes the

00:08:03.584 --> 00:08:07.170
book as expressing ideology by
means of a programmatic speech

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.920
put into the mouth of a great
leader.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.637
That's a very common practice
in later Israelite

00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:15.296
historiography,
and he says it's happening here

00:08:15.296 --> 00:08:17.645
already.
And I'll be referring quite a

00:08:17.645 --> 00:08:20.670
bit to Weinfeld's work as we
talk about Deuteronomy.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:23.733
Deuteronomy differs from the
other books of the Pentateuch in

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:25.009
other significant ways.
 

00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:27.391
So for example,
according to the Priestly

00:08:27.391 --> 00:08:29.952
writer, Israel received its
laws, its Torah,

00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:31.620
from God at Mount Sinai.
 

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.368
But in Deuteronomy the laws
were given here on the Plains of

00:08:35.368 --> 00:08:38.926
Moab, 40 years after Sinai,
before the Israelites crossed

00:08:38.926 --> 00:08:41.422
the Jordan.
At Sinai the Israelites heard

00:08:41.422 --> 00:08:44.506
the Decalogue but the remainder
of the laws, it would seem,

00:08:44.506 --> 00:08:46.580
are delivered on the Plains of
Moab.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.214
We can look at the basic
structure of Deuteronomy in a

00:08:49.214 --> 00:08:51.649
couple of ways.
We can do a kind of literary

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:54.373
division, which I have on this
side of the board,

00:08:54.373 --> 00:08:56.019
according to the speeches.
 

00:08:56.019 --> 00:08:59.365
So to begin we have the first
speech which is a sort of

00:08:59.365 --> 00:09:02.215
introductory speech in the first
four chapters,

00:09:02.215 --> 00:09:03.639
going through 4:43.
 

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:06.764
There's an introduction that
gives us the location,

00:09:06.764 --> 00:09:09.952
where the Israelites are,
and also then Moses' first

00:09:09.952 --> 00:09:12.369
sermon.
Moses in this sermon is giving

00:09:12.369 --> 00:09:14.847
a historical review,
and the purpose of this

00:09:14.847 --> 00:09:18.078
historical review is didactic;
he wants the Israelites to

00:09:18.078 --> 00:09:20.327
learn something,
to infer something from this

00:09:20.327 --> 00:09:23.240
review of their history from
Sinai to the present day.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.740
And in that review,
as he retells the story,

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.230
which we've just been reading
about in the previous books,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:32.730
we see his selective choice of
events, we see how he's

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:36.759
describing things in a way that
underscores God's faithful,

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:39.554
loyal, fulfillment of the
covenantal promise,

00:09:39.554 --> 00:09:43.429
and he's using this to urge the
Israelites to do their part by

00:09:43.429 --> 00:09:44.889
obeying God's laws.
 

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:50.299
The second speech extends from
4:44 through 28:6.

00:09:50.299 --> 00:09:52.900
And this also contains a bit of
a historical review,

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.807
again retelling some of the
narrative of the earlier books

00:09:55.807 --> 00:09:59.020
of the Torah and again giving us
an insight into this phenomenon

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.009
of inner biblical
interpretation,

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:04.016
or parts of the Bible that
review parts elsewhere are

00:10:04.016 --> 00:10:07.485
already beginning to interpret
and present that material in a

00:10:07.485 --> 00:10:08.700
particular light.
 

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.288
But then we have a central
section of laws being presented,

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:14.225
beginning at about 12;
so this is still part of Moses'

00:10:14.225 --> 00:10:16.934
second speech,
but stretching from Deuteronomy

00:10:16.934 --> 00:10:20.198
12 through 26 we have laws,
and this is in many ways a

00:10:20.198 --> 00:10:23.059
repetition of much of the
revealed legislation we've

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:24.350
already encountered.
 

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.831
That central portion of laws,
12 through 26,

00:10:26.831 --> 00:10:29.659
is thought to be the earliest
core of the book.

00:10:29.659 --> 00:10:32.169
We're going to come back and
talk about that in a moment.

00:10:32.169 --> 00:10:35.836
Now the Greek title for this
book, which is Deuteronomy,

00:10:35.836 --> 00:10:38.153
deutero nomos,
a second law,

00:10:38.153 --> 00:10:41.406
a repetition of the law,
and that name derives from the

00:10:41.406 --> 00:10:44.841
fact that the bulk of the book
contains this legal core of

00:10:44.841 --> 00:10:47.009
material which reviews the law.
 

00:10:47.009 --> 00:10:52.059
In Chapter 27 we have a
covenant renewal ceremony.

00:10:52.059 --> 00:10:55.358
It takes place on a mountain
near Shechem after the

00:10:55.358 --> 00:10:57.799
Israelites have crossed the
Jordan.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:00.007
It describes the ceremony that
will take place,

00:11:00.007 --> 00:11:02.309
excuse me, after they have
crossed the Jordan.

00:11:02.309 --> 00:11:06.164
And from ancient Greece we know
that in the ancient world

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:08.779
settlers who would colonize a
place,

00:11:08.779 --> 00:11:11.849
particularly if they colonized
a place at divine instigation,

00:11:11.849 --> 00:11:14.406
they would perform certain
ceremonies that would be

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:17.220
accompanied by blessings and
accompanied by curses.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.695
They would write the laws on
stone pillars,

00:11:19.695 --> 00:11:22.230
they would erect an altar for
sacrifices,

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.424
they would proclaim blessings
and curses for those who obey

00:11:26.424 --> 00:11:30.620
and disobey--very similar to
what happens in chapter 27;

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.399
all of these elements appear in
chapter 27.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:38.579
Chapter 28 lists the material
rewards that will accrue to

00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:41.639
Israel if she is faithful to
God's law,

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:44.377
and the punishments if she
should disobey--and some of

00:11:44.377 --> 00:11:45.720
these are very creative.
 

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.189
But the importance of the
Deuteronomist's view of history

00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:52.349
in which Israel's fate is
totally conditioned on her

00:11:52.349 --> 00:11:56.253
obedience to the covenant--this
is something that will occupy us

00:11:56.253 --> 00:11:58.360
repeatedly at a future date.
 

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.431
I mention it here but it's
something we will need to come

00:12:01.431 --> 00:12:03.949
back to.
The third speech of Moses is in

00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:05.220
Chapters 29 and 30.
 

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.426
This speech emphasizes the
degree to which evil fortune is

00:12:09.426 --> 00:12:12.230
the responsibility of the
community.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:16.194
Moses enumerates additional
misfortunes and sufferings that

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:18.450
will befall Israel if she sins.
 

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:22.756
But he emphasizes the choice is
Israel's: God has been clear

00:12:22.756 --> 00:12:26.859
regarding what's required,
and it's not beyond Israel's

00:12:26.859 --> 00:12:29.580
reach to attain life and
prosperity.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.580
She needs to only choose.
 

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.020
And this is all set out in a
speech in Chapter 30.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.372
I'll read from verses 11 to 20:
Surely,

00:12:37.372 --> 00:12:40.876
this Instruction which I enjoin
upon you this day is not too

00:12:40.876 --> 00:12:43.490
baffling for you,
nor is it beyond reach.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.788
It is not in the heavens,
that you should say,

00:12:45.788 --> 00:12:48.801
"Who among us can go up to the
heavens and get it for us and

00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.100
impart it to us,
that we may observe it?"

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.463
Neither is it beyond the sea,
that you should say,

00:12:53.463 --> 00:12:56.454
"Who among us can cross to the
other side of the sea and get it

00:12:56.454 --> 00:12:59.100
for us and impart it to us,
that we may observe it?"

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.432
No, the thing is very close to
you, in your mouth and in your

00:13:02.432 --> 00:13:03.710
heart, to observe it.
 

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:06.883
See, I set before you this day
life and prosperity,

00:13:06.883 --> 00:13:08.279
death and adversity.
 

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:10.551
For I command you this day,
to love the Lord your God,

00:13:10.551 --> 00:13:12.779
to walk in His ways,
and to keep His commandments,

00:13:12.779 --> 00:13:14.781
His laws, and His rules,
that you may thrive and

00:13:14.781 --> 00:13:17.380
increase, and that the Lord your
God may bless you in the land

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.509
that you are about to enter and
possess.

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:22.850
Listen to the cadences of this
kind of language in Deuteronomy.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.201
We haven't heard language like
this before but it's what people

00:13:25.201 --> 00:13:27.250
often think of when they think
of biblical language.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.080
It starts here in Deuteronomy.
 

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.231
But if your heart turns
away and you give no heed,

00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:33.539
and are lured into the worship
and service of other gods,

00:13:33.539 --> 00:13:36.929
I declare to you this day that
you shall certainly perish;

00:13:36.929 --> 00:13:39.596
you shall not long endure on
the soil that you are crossing

00:13:39.596 --> 00:13:41.159
the Jordan to enter and possess.
 

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:44.262
I call heaven and earth to
witness against you this day:

00:13:44.262 --> 00:13:47.590
I have put before you life and
death, blessing and curse.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.844
Choose life--if you and your
offspring would live--by loving

00:13:50.844 --> 00:13:52.995
the Lord your God,
heeding His commands,

00:13:52.995 --> 00:13:54.539
and holding fast to Him.
 

00:13:54.539 --> 00:13:57.887
For thereby you shall have life
and shall long endure upon the

00:13:57.887 --> 00:14:00.850
soil that the Lord your God
swore to your ancestors,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.164
Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, to give to

00:14:03.164 --> 00:14:05.419
them.
So all has been given.

00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:09.159
It's simply Israel's choice to
take it or not.

00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:12.547
The last section of the book,
chapters 31 to 34,

00:14:12.547 --> 00:14:15.429
is a sort of miscellany of
appendices.

00:14:15.429 --> 00:14:18.813
There's some ancient poetry
that's found in chapter 32,

00:14:18.813 --> 00:14:21.570
which is referred to as The
Song of Moses;

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.559
scholars refer to it as The
Song of Moses.

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:27.157
We have the blessings of Moses
recorded in chapter 33,

00:14:27.157 --> 00:14:30.415
and then chapter 34 is the
story of Moses' death:

00:14:30.415 --> 00:14:32.519
I read part of that to you.
 

00:14:32.519 --> 00:14:36.900
Now centuries ago already
scholars of the Bible noted that

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.590
Deuteronomy opens with the
verse,

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:44.072
"These are the words that Moses
addressed to all Israel on the

00:14:44.072 --> 00:14:46.991
other side of the Jordan,"
that is to say the

00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:48.761
trans-Jordan,
on the other side of the

00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:50.779
Jordan.
So that line is obviously

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:54.720
written from the prospective of
someone who is inside the land,

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.951
saying Moses said that when he
was over there,

00:14:56.951 --> 00:14:58.985
outside the land,
on the other side of the

00:14:58.985 --> 00:15:00.820
Jordan--so he's looking
eastward.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.020
And so that's a line that one
would think could not be written

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.115
by Moses because Moses did not
ever enter the land and would

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:10.053
not be in a position to talk
about something being on the

00:15:10.053 --> 00:15:11.679
other side of the Jordan.
 

00:15:11.679 --> 00:15:15.286
Likewise the last chapter which
describes Moses' death and

00:15:15.286 --> 00:15:17.879
burial probably was not written
by him.

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:20.424
So as we shall see,
these and many other textual

00:15:20.424 --> 00:15:23.779
features point to the period of
composition for Deuteronomy,

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:27.039
which was many centuries after
the time that Moses would have

00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:30.680
been supposed to have lived,
if we are to assume he was a

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.259
historical character.
 

00:15:32.259 --> 00:15:35.446
And so through careful analysis
you have scholars like Moshe

00:15:35.446 --> 00:15:38.471
Weinfeld and many others--I
think Bernard Levinson is the

00:15:38.471 --> 00:15:41.171
one has written about
Deuteronomy in your Jewish

00:15:41.171 --> 00:15:43.736
Study Bible,
and that's a wonderful

00:15:43.736 --> 00:15:47.177
introduction to read there,
so I encourage you to please

00:15:47.177 --> 00:15:51.057
make sure you look at that--but
analyses of scholars like these

00:15:51.057 --> 00:15:54.373
have led them to draw the
conclusion that the original

00:15:54.373 --> 00:15:57.940
core of Deuteronomy emerged in
the eighth century,

00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.956
and this is now where my
interesting little

00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:02.500
mountain-shaped diagram is going
to come into play.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:08.143
It was probably a scroll of
laws known as the Book or the

00:16:08.143 --> 00:16:10.360
Scroll of the Torah.
 

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.591
Deuteronomy refers to itself
that way in Deuteronomy

00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:18.356
17:19-20.
And so we think it was probably

00:16:18.356 --> 00:16:21.049
something roughly equivalent to
chapters 12 to 26;

00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:22.749
maybe there was a little
introduction,

00:16:22.749 --> 00:16:23.759
a little conclusion.
 

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:28.242
And eventually these laws were
put into the framework of a

00:16:28.242 --> 00:16:31.937
speech by Moses:
maybe chapters 5 through 11 and

00:16:31.937 --> 00:16:34.604
maybe 28;
maybe that would've been in the

00:16:34.604 --> 00:16:35.929
eighth, seventh century.
 

00:16:35.929 --> 00:16:38.712
And then at some later point
several things happened,

00:16:38.712 --> 00:16:41.120
and I will say them in the
following order,

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.308
but that doesn't mean they
happened in this order,

00:16:43.308 --> 00:16:44.379
we really aren't sure.
 

00:16:44.379 --> 00:16:46.120
At some point several things
happened.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.896
You have framing chapters,
Deuteronomy 1 through 4,

00:16:48.896 --> 00:16:51.950
the sort of introductory frame
and historical review,

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.477
as well as the appendices at
the end, chapters 31 and

00:16:55.477 --> 00:16:56.970
34--those get added.
 

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.889
You also have laws being
updated, passages being

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:04.809
expanded, to reflect the
experience of exile.

00:17:04.809 --> 00:17:09.452
You'll remember that as of 586,
Jerusalem is destroyed and the

00:17:09.452 --> 00:17:12.420
Israelites are in exile in
Babylonia.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.743
Additionally at some point
Deuteronomy is appended to the

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.940
other four books of the
Pentateuch.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:21.779
Genesis through Numbers is made
to precede this.

00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:26.197
It's serving therefore as their
conclusion, and by being joined

00:17:26.197 --> 00:17:29.759
to them it confers its title as
a book of Torah,

00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:32.259
as a scroll of Torah,
to that material as well.

00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:36.730
They don't use the word "Torah"
in that way, in those books;

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.362
only Deuteronomy uses the word
Torah to speak of God's

00:17:39.362 --> 00:17:41.150
instruction or revelation
overall.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.158
So by being appended now to
Genesis through Numbers,

00:17:44.158 --> 00:17:46.872
all of this perhaps comes to be
known as Torah,

00:17:46.872 --> 00:17:49.935
as well.
And then finally during the

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:53.513
exile or sorry,
probably during the period

00:17:53.513 --> 00:17:56.510
after the exile--no,
during the exile,

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.539
down to the end of the sixth
century, Deuteronomy was

00:17:59.539 --> 00:18:02.917
incorporated into a larger
narrative history that runs from

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:05.648
Joshua through Judges,
First and Second Samuel,

00:18:05.648 --> 00:18:07.626
First and Second Kings:
that's all a unit,

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:09.750
as we'll come to see in the
next lecture.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.797
And so Deuteronomy in a way
served as an introduction to

00:18:12.797 --> 00:18:16.400
that material looking forward;
so a conclusion to the previous

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.588
four books but also an
introduction to a long narrative

00:18:19.588 --> 00:18:23.190
history that's going to run
through to the end of 2 Kings.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.276
Now there's a lot of debate
over the precise timing of these

00:18:26.276 --> 00:18:29.309
events and this process by which
this material grew and was

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:31.931
expanded,
but in the post-exilic period,

00:18:31.931 --> 00:18:33.872
at some point,
the entire unit,

00:18:33.872 --> 00:18:36.460
the Genesis through Numbers
material,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.530
Deuteronomy,
and then the lengthy historical

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.599
narrative, all the way through 2
Kings, was solidified.

00:18:43.599 --> 00:18:47.390
The Deuteronomistic history is
sort of an odd conclusion to the

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:51.181
Genesis through Numbers material
because it doesn't really have

00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:53.259
the expected narrative climax.
 

00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:56.369
You sort of expect the story to
end with the entry of the

00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:59.200
Israelites into the land,
and hopefully under Moses,

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.700
and that doesn't occur.
 

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.748
Some scholars have suggested
that deferring Israel's

00:19:04.748 --> 00:19:09.351
possession of the land to the
future may have reflected the

00:19:09.351 --> 00:19:13.729
historical experience of exile,
an experience which challenged

00:19:13.729 --> 00:19:16.927
the very idea of the possession
of the land as central to the

00:19:16.927 --> 00:19:18.579
maintenance of the covenant.
 

00:19:18.579 --> 00:19:22.232
So if you are in exile,
then perhaps a more satisfying

00:19:22.232 --> 00:19:26.160
ending is to have Israel not in
fact entering the land.

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.359
The complex process by which
Deuteronomy was formed

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:35.650
underscores the fact that modern
notions of authorship cannot be

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:38.170
applied to biblical texts.
 

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:41.316
We think of an author,
we tend to think of an author,

00:19:41.316 --> 00:19:44.765
as a discrete individual who
composes a text at a specific

00:19:44.765 --> 00:19:46.677
time,
but this isn't the way that

00:19:46.677 --> 00:19:48.803
texts came into being in the
ancient world,

00:19:48.803 --> 00:19:50.880
particularly important communal
texts.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.002
As Weinfeld points out,
the biblical authors were what

00:19:55.002 --> 00:19:58.502
we would call collectors,
compilers, revisers,

00:19:58.502 --> 00:20:02.470
editors, and interpreters of
ancient tradition.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:06.694
Ancient texts were generally
the product of many hands over

00:20:06.694 --> 00:20:09.390
the stretch of many long
centuries,

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:12.441
and during that time
modifications and

00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:15.079
recontextualizations occurred.
 

00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:19.011
And so we refer to those who
transmit and develop a text in

00:20:19.011 --> 00:20:22.335
this way as a school;
but you need to understand that

00:20:22.335 --> 00:20:25.069
we are using that in a
relatively informal way.

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:27.908
So when we talk about the
Deuteronomic School or the

00:20:27.908 --> 00:20:30.881
Deuteronomistic School,
we're really talking about the

00:20:30.881 --> 00:20:34.255
fact that we have a set of texts
that all seem to share a certain

00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:37.593
sort of ideology or orientation;
and yet we know that parts of

00:20:37.593 --> 00:20:40.220
them seem to date from very,
very different times.

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.284
And so we think of that text as
being preserved,

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:46.936
transmitted and developed by
many hands who share certain

00:20:46.936 --> 00:20:49.286
commonalities,
common ideologies,

00:20:49.286 --> 00:20:50.660
we call it a school.
 

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.111
It's not that we know of the
existence of a Deuteronomistic

00:20:53.111 --> 00:20:55.097
school, and we say,
oh, well then they must have

00:20:55.097 --> 00:20:56.070
produced this text.
 

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.039
It's the other way around.
 

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:59.993
We have a text,
and its features suggest to us

00:20:59.993 --> 00:21:03.801
a longstanding tradition of
scholarship, that preserved and

00:21:03.801 --> 00:21:06.230
transmitted the text in that
way.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.905
Same with the Priestly school:
we're speaking about the

00:21:08.905 --> 00:21:11.878
Priestly materials which clearly
have evidence of originating

00:21:11.878 --> 00:21:14.328
from the eighth,
seventh, sixth and fifth

00:21:14.328 --> 00:21:17.792
centuries, and so there must
have been a common stretch of

00:21:17.792 --> 00:21:21.195
scholarship that would have
preserved and transmitted and

00:21:21.195 --> 00:21:25.632
developed those traditions,
and we call that the Priestly

00:21:25.632 --> 00:21:27.263
school.
The legal core of

00:21:27.263 --> 00:21:30.706
Deuteronomy--so really from 5 to
26, because 5 is where some of

00:21:30.706 --> 00:21:33.426
the legal material
begins--contains first of all a

00:21:33.426 --> 00:21:36.480
somewhat expanded version of the
Ten Commandments,

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.601
you have that in Deuteronomy 5,
and then other laws,

00:21:39.601 --> 00:21:42.295
really from 12 to 26,
that resemble the legal

00:21:42.295 --> 00:21:45.294
material that's found in
Exodus--the collection of

00:21:45.294 --> 00:21:48.109
material we've called the
Covenant Code.

00:21:48.109 --> 00:21:51.285
And they also seem to bear some
relationship to the laws in

00:21:51.285 --> 00:21:52.599
Leviticus and Numbers.
 

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:54.666
But the question is,
what is the relationship

00:21:54.666 --> 00:21:57.250
between the different versions
of the legal material?

00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:00.711
Some of these laws will
parallel each other quite

00:22:00.711 --> 00:22:02.730
closely and others do not.
 

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.573
So are Deuteronomy's legal
traditions a direct response to

00:22:06.573 --> 00:22:10.079
or modification of the laws in
Exodus and Numbers,

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:13.148
or are they best understood as
just different,

00:22:13.148 --> 00:22:16.900
independent formulations of a
common legal tradition?

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.304
Weinfeld has argued that
Deuteronomy is dependent on the

00:22:20.304 --> 00:22:22.779
previous traditions of the
Pentateuch,

00:22:22.779 --> 00:22:27.097
that Deuteronomy revises and
reforms them according to new

00:22:27.097 --> 00:22:31.339
ideas: its new notion of a
centralized cultic worship,

00:22:31.339 --> 00:22:35.180
and secondly its humanitarian
spirit.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:38.580
Those are two controlling
ideologies he says that shape

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.099
its revision of pre-existing
material.

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:43.841
He specifically argues that
Deuteronomy is dependent on the

00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:46.772
E source, the source that some
scholars think is pretty hard to

00:22:46.772 --> 00:22:48.710
isolate or find in the biblical
text.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.690
But in E, Sinai is referred to
as Horeb, and in Deuteronomy

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.200
Sinai is also Horeb.
 

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:57.544
The author of Deuteronomy
limits the revelation at Sinai

00:22:57.544 --> 00:23:01.011
to the Decalogue and seems to
assert that the full law was

00:23:01.011 --> 00:23:03.991
given to Moses for the
Israelites on the plains of

00:23:03.991 --> 00:23:06.719
Moab.
In Weinfeld's view this means

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:09.275
that Deuteronomy,
with its revisions,

00:23:09.275 --> 00:23:12.394
would have been seen,
would have been presented as

00:23:12.394 --> 00:23:15.427
and would have been seen as an
updated replacement of the old

00:23:15.427 --> 00:23:18.309
Book of the Covenant,
rather than its complement.

00:23:18.309 --> 00:23:21.534
It exists side by side in our
text now, but I think in his

00:23:21.534 --> 00:23:24.759
view those who promulgated it
were understanding it as the

00:23:24.759 --> 00:23:28.380
updated replacement of the laws
of the Book of the Covenant.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.481
For the most part Deuteronomy
doesn't really contain much in

00:23:31.481 --> 00:23:32.690
the way of civil law.
 

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.044
It tends to focus on the
moral-religious

00:23:35.044 --> 00:23:38.546
prescriptions--kind of the
apodictic law in Israel--and the

00:23:38.546 --> 00:23:42.229
few civil laws that are there
tend to be reworked in line with

00:23:42.229 --> 00:23:43.980
Deuteronomy's humanity.
 

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:46.441
So, for example,
the laws of the tithe,

00:23:46.441 --> 00:23:49.549
the laws of the seventh year
release of debts,

00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:52.410
the rules for the release of
slaves, the rules for the three

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.349
festivals--these are all ancient
laws;

00:23:54.349 --> 00:23:57.192
they occur in Exodus but they
appear in Deuteronomy with

00:23:57.192 --> 00:23:59.517
modifications,
modifications about things that

00:23:59.517 --> 00:24:02.694
concern the Deuteronomists,
and some of you have discussed

00:24:02.694 --> 00:24:04.059
some of these in section.
 

00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:08.790
So in Deuteronomy the Israelite
debt slave comes out of his or

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:12.047
her servitude,
with generous gifts from the

00:24:12.047 --> 00:24:14.257
owners.
This is not something that

00:24:14.257 --> 00:24:15.250
appears in Exodus.
 

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.039
Or as another example,
Deuteronomy extends the

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:21.510
Covenant Code's prohibition
against afflicting a resident

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:23.468
alien.
In Deuteronomy there's the

00:24:23.468 --> 00:24:26.351
insistence that the Israelites
must not just refrain from

00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:28.513
afflicting them,
but must love the resident

00:24:28.513 --> 00:24:31.033
alien.
It goes so far as to provide

00:24:31.033 --> 00:24:33.755
concrete legal benefits,
food and so on,

00:24:33.755 --> 00:24:35.569
for the resident alien.
 

00:24:35.569 --> 00:24:39.839
So while the relationship of D
to some of the laws in the

00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:43.728
Covenant Code is often--not
always but often--one of

00:24:43.728 --> 00:24:46.699
revision,
the relationship between D and

00:24:46.699 --> 00:24:50.064
the laws in the Priestly source
is more difficult to

00:24:50.064 --> 00:24:52.754
characterize.
The Priestly source seems to

00:24:52.754 --> 00:24:56.140
represent an equally early set
of laws, legal traditions,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.976
that just emanated from a very
different circle and had

00:24:58.976 --> 00:25:00.079
different concerns.
 

00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:03.146
It tends to deal with sacral
topics, or if it's dealing with

00:25:03.146 --> 00:25:06.368
other topics it will deal with
the sacral implications of those

00:25:06.368 --> 00:25:09.147
topics.
Like D, P often updates and

00:25:09.147 --> 00:25:12.009
revises laws of the Covenant
Code.

00:25:12.009 --> 00:25:15.334
We can see that in the fact
that the Priestly source

00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:19.180
abolishes Israelite debt slavery
altogether and insists that

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.026
slaves must be acquired only
from the nations around Israel:

00:25:23.026 --> 00:25:26.220
no Israelite can enslave
another Israelite.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:29.828
Nevertheless Weinfeld argues
that on occasion Deuteronomy

00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:32.470
contains laws that are also
found in P,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.209
but presents them in a more
rational manner,

00:25:35.209 --> 00:25:38.140
is the word he uses,
or desacralized manner.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.388
So D's treatment,
Deuteronomy's treatment of

00:25:40.388 --> 00:25:42.845
sacrifice, we'll see in a
moment, is going to be

00:25:42.845 --> 00:25:44.779
different, for example,
from P's.

00:25:44.779 --> 00:25:47.548
They have different concerns
and different foci in their

00:25:47.548 --> 00:25:49.160
presentation of that material.
 

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.208
In any event,
many scholars through their

00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:54.127
analysis of these texts have
been led to conclude that the

00:25:54.127 --> 00:25:57.200
Deuteronomistic School updated
and revised earlier laws,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.198
particularly laws in the
Covenant Code,

00:26:00.198 --> 00:26:04.380
but sometimes also in the older
legal stratum of P;

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.130
and they did so in keeping with
the circumstances of the eighth

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:09.279
to sixth century.
 

00:26:09.279 --> 00:26:12.775
So Deuteronomy exemplifies a
phenomenon that occurs at

00:26:12.775 --> 00:26:16.468
several critical junctures in
Israel's history--and we're

00:26:16.468 --> 00:26:20.161
going to see this as we move
forward through the biblical

00:26:20.161 --> 00:26:23.524
text--and that is the
modification and re-writing of

00:26:23.524 --> 00:26:27.481
earlier laws and traditions in
the light of new circumstances

00:26:27.481 --> 00:26:31.644
and ideas.
So Deuteronomy is itself an

00:26:31.644 --> 00:26:37.650
implicit authorization of the
process of interpretation.

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.627
And the notion of canon,
or sacred canon,

00:26:40.627 --> 00:26:44.497
that's exemplified then by
biblical texts is one that

00:26:44.497 --> 00:26:48.889
allows for continued unfolding
and development of the sacred

00:26:48.889 --> 00:26:52.050
tradition.
And that's an idea that I think

00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:55.799
differs very much from modern
intuitions about the nature of

00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:59.132
sacred canons.
I think a lot of people have

00:26:59.132 --> 00:27:03.556
the intuition that a sacred
canon means that the text is

00:27:03.556 --> 00:27:05.993
fixed,
static and authoritative

00:27:05.993 --> 00:27:09.349
because it is fixed and static,
or unchanging.

00:27:09.349 --> 00:27:13.519
That's not the biblical view or
ancient view of sacred canon.

00:27:13.519 --> 00:27:17.723
Texts representing sacred
revelation were modified,

00:27:17.723 --> 00:27:21.170
they were revised,
they were rephrased,

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:24.926
they were updated and they were
interpreted in the process of

00:27:24.926 --> 00:27:26.930
transmission and preservation.
 

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.062
It was precisely because a text
or a tradition was sacred and

00:27:31.062 --> 00:27:34.644
authoritative that it was
important that it adapt and

00:27:34.644 --> 00:27:38.849
speak to new circumstances;
otherwise it would appear to be

00:27:38.849 --> 00:27:41.382
irrelevant.
So it's a very different notion

00:27:41.382 --> 00:27:44.680
of what it means for something
to be canonical and sacred,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.779
from what I think some moderns
have come to understand those

00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:50.446
terms to mean.
So what are the special

00:27:50.446 --> 00:27:55.447
circumstances and concerns that
guide Deuteronomy's revisions of

00:27:55.447 --> 00:27:58.279
tradition?
One of the primary changes--you

00:27:58.279 --> 00:28:01.705
probably heard in section as
well by now--is the emphasis on

00:28:01.705 --> 00:28:03.970
worship at a single,
central shrine.

00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:07.787
That's going to represent a
great change in Israel's

00:28:07.787 --> 00:28:09.359
religious practice.
 

00:28:09.359 --> 00:28:11.984
According to Deuteronomy the
central sanctuary will be

00:28:11.984 --> 00:28:14.757
located in a place that God
himself will choose--it's not

00:28:14.757 --> 00:28:17.629
named in Deuteronomy--or in a
place where he will cause his

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:20.253
name to dwell;
that's the other phrase that's

00:28:20.253 --> 00:28:22.088
used.
Jerusalem is never explicitly

00:28:22.088 --> 00:28:24.741
mentioned as the site in
question but Jerusalem will

00:28:24.741 --> 00:28:27.375
later,
in fact, fulfill this function,

00:28:27.375 --> 00:28:29.819
according to other biblical
texts.

00:28:29.819 --> 00:28:32.715
Now there are striking
similarities between

00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:36.989
Deuteronomy's religious program
and the major religious reforms

00:28:36.989 --> 00:28:41.470
that were carried out in the
eighth century by King Hezekiah,

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:46.107
but even more so in the seventh
century by King Josiah,

00:28:46.107 --> 00:28:48.339
around 622: King Josiah.
 

00:28:48.339 --> 00:28:52.871
This is a reform that's
reported in the book of 2 Kings,

00:28:52.871 --> 00:28:56.562
in 2 Kings 22.
This reform has long been

00:28:56.562 --> 00:29:02.352
noticed and provides scholars
with a basis for dating the core

00:29:02.352 --> 00:29:07.071
materials of Deuteronomy,
dating them to the late seventh

00:29:07.071 --> 00:29:09.588
century.
According to the story in 2

00:29:09.588 --> 00:29:13.851
Kings, during temple repairs
that were being done in the time

00:29:13.851 --> 00:29:16.894
of King Josiah,
the scroll of the Torah--that's

00:29:16.894 --> 00:29:20.424
how it's phrased--the scroll of
the Torah was found and when it

00:29:20.424 --> 00:29:23.897
was read the king was distressed
because its requirements were

00:29:23.897 --> 00:29:25.150
not being upheld.
 

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.596
Now this term,
the scroll of the Torah,

00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:28.690
as I said, does not occur in
Genesis through Numbers;

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.309
it is a phrase that occurs in
Deuteronomy, in Deuteronomy 17.

00:29:32.309 --> 00:29:38.157
Then continuing the account in
2 Kings, Josiah is said to take

00:29:38.157 --> 00:29:40.341
action.
He assembles the people,

00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:43.533
he publicly reads the scroll,
the people agree to its terms

00:29:43.533 --> 00:29:45.460
and then Josiah's reforms begin.
 

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.875
We hear that he purges the
temple of vessels that had been

00:29:48.875 --> 00:29:51.990
made for Baal and Asherah,
that were in the Temple of

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:54.609
Yahweh.
He removes all foreign elements

00:29:54.609 --> 00:29:57.075
from the cult,
he prohibits sacrifice to

00:29:57.075 --> 00:30:00.109
Yahweh anywhere but in the
central sanctuary.

00:30:00.109 --> 00:30:03.588
He destroys all of the high
places--this refers to sort of

00:30:03.588 --> 00:30:06.455
rural shrines that were
scattered throughout the

00:30:06.455 --> 00:30:09.751
countryside where local priests
and Levites might offer

00:30:09.751 --> 00:30:13.351
sacrifices for people--ritual
shrines and pillars being used

00:30:13.351 --> 00:30:16.585
in the worship of Yahweh:
these are deemed to be quite

00:30:16.585 --> 00:30:19.269
legitimate in the J and E
sources.

00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:21.746
The patriarchs are doing this
sort of thing all the time,

00:30:21.746 --> 00:30:23.559
building altars all around the
country,

00:30:23.559 --> 00:30:26.770
but it's Deuteronomy that
contains commandments to destroy

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.094
the worship, first of all the
worship of other gods but also

00:30:30.094 --> 00:30:33.529
the worship of Yahweh in high
places or in rural shrines.

00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:36.979
So this is evidence again that
what Josiah found to base his

00:30:36.979 --> 00:30:40.078
reforms on was something like
the Book of Deuteronomy:

00:30:40.078 --> 00:30:43.644
it's Deuteronomy that contains
the prohibitions of high places

00:30:43.644 --> 00:30:46.084
and so on.
After these reforms it's

00:30:46.084 --> 00:30:48.779
reported that the Passover was
celebrated.

00:30:48.779 --> 00:30:51.822
It was celebrated not as a
family observance in individual

00:30:51.822 --> 00:30:54.395
homes;
it was celebrated as a national

00:30:54.395 --> 00:30:57.510
pilgrimage festival,
celebrated by everyone in

00:30:57.510 --> 00:30:59.907
Jerusalem.
That's how its celebration is

00:30:59.907 --> 00:31:01.869
described in the Book of
Deuteronomy.

00:31:01.869 --> 00:31:04.663
It's described as a family
celebration in individual homes

00:31:04.663 --> 00:31:06.329
in the other books of the Bible.
 

00:31:06.329 --> 00:31:09.387
So again this is another basis
for the conclusion that the

00:31:09.387 --> 00:31:12.330
scroll of the law,
found by Josiah and guiding his

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.890
reforms, was something like the
legal core of Deuteronomy.

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.516
Scholars now think that that
legal core of Deuteronomy was

00:31:18.516 --> 00:31:20.130
produced in the Northern
Kingdom,

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.167
the Northern Kingdom of Israel
which fell in 722,

00:31:23.167 --> 00:31:25.766
you'll recall.
It was probably produced there

00:31:25.766 --> 00:31:28.410
in the eighth century,
and that is supported by the

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.371
fact that Deuteronomy has
affinities with the writings of

00:31:31.371 --> 00:31:34.333
some prophets we'll be looking
at later from the Northern

00:31:34.333 --> 00:31:37.534
Kingdom of the eighth century,
such as the prophet Hosea,

00:31:37.534 --> 00:31:40.069
and we'll see this when we look
at Hosea's writings.

00:31:40.069 --> 00:31:43.374
It also has affinities with the
E source, which is also

00:31:43.374 --> 00:31:45.700
connected with the Northern
Kingdom.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:49.376
In the ninth and eighth
century, the Northern Kingdom

00:31:49.376 --> 00:31:52.911
was the site of a struggle,
a struggle against Baal

00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:55.559
worship.
It was also home to certain

00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:59.424
prophets such as Elijah and
Elisha, who are known for their

00:31:59.424 --> 00:32:02.089
zealotry and their exclusive
Yahwism.

00:32:02.089 --> 00:32:05.680
So some scholars think that was
going on in the ninth/eighth

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:09.551
century in the north,
the sort of Yahweh-only party

00:32:09.551 --> 00:32:14.579
that was working hard and
struggling against Baal worship.

00:32:14.579 --> 00:32:16.996
And they think that those
Yahweh-only traditions were

00:32:16.996 --> 00:32:19.096
brought south;
after the fall of the Northern

00:32:19.096 --> 00:32:21.175
Kingdom in 722,
you have refugees coming south,

00:32:21.175 --> 00:32:23.119
they brought these traditions
with them.

00:32:23.119 --> 00:32:25.902
Some of these written materials
were put into the Temple and

00:32:25.902 --> 00:32:28.562
then about a century later,
during Josiah's time,

00:32:28.562 --> 00:32:32.009
when the Temple was being
refurbished, they were found.

00:32:32.009 --> 00:32:36.348
Possibly this material was then
worked into a larger scroll,

00:32:36.348 --> 00:32:40.246
given its Mosaic introductions
and so on, and that all

00:32:40.246 --> 00:32:42.819
contributed to Josiah's reform.
 

00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:46.724
So the centralization of the
cult also needs to be understood

00:32:46.724 --> 00:32:50.369
against the larger political
backdrop of the late seventh

00:32:50.369 --> 00:32:53.308
century.
The Assyrian threat loomed

00:32:53.308 --> 00:32:55.389
large.
You have to remember that the

00:32:55.389 --> 00:32:58.180
Northern Kingdom has already
been completely destroyed:

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.920
ten tribes exiled,
deported, and essentially lost.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.561
The Southern Kingdom managed to
escape destruction but only by

00:33:04.561 --> 00:33:06.950
paying tribute as a vassal to
Assyria.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:10.737
So Judah, the Southern Kingdom,
is a tribute-paying vassal

00:33:10.737 --> 00:33:12.930
state to the Assyrian overlord.
 

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.639
And of course there's a great
deal of Assyrian cultural

00:33:15.639 --> 00:33:18.500
influence and religious
influence in Judah as a result.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.417
So 2 Kings tells us that there
were foreign forms of worship

00:33:22.417 --> 00:33:25.140
being introduced right into the
Temple.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:28.679
Josiah's reforms have been
interpreted by some as an

00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:32.913
attempt to assert the political
and the cultural and religious

00:33:32.913 --> 00:33:34.440
autonomy of Judah.
 

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.725
Unregulated worship throughout
the land was no longer going to

00:33:38.725 --> 00:33:41.442
be acceptable;
the people were going to be

00:33:41.442 --> 00:33:44.332
united around a central,
standardized Yahweh cult,

00:33:44.332 --> 00:33:47.695
which would be purged of any
Assyrian influence or foreign

00:33:47.695 --> 00:33:50.059
influence.
And this was deemed as

00:33:50.059 --> 00:33:54.430
necessary to stand up against or
to survive the Assyrian threat.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:58.193
So it's in that context that we
can look at the very strong

00:33:58.193 --> 00:34:02.282
parallels that exist between the
Book of Deuteronomy and certain

00:34:02.282 --> 00:34:05.809
Assyrian treaties,
from the seventh century.

00:34:05.809 --> 00:34:10.148
We already talked about the
Hittite vassal treaties as a

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:14.329
model for the Israelite
covenant, when we were talking

00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:17.489
about Exodus.
But Deuteronomy is clearly

00:34:17.489 --> 00:34:21.480
dependent on another model and
that is the Assyrian vassal

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:26.217
treaty.
The best exemplars of these

00:34:26.217 --> 00:34:35.489
treaties are the treaties of the
Assyrian emperor Esarhaddon.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:40.550
He was a seventh century ruler
of Assyria, down to about 669.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:42.611
These treaties were discovered
about 50 years ago,

00:34:42.611 --> 00:34:44.756
and Moshe Weinfeld is one of
the people who's done a

00:34:44.756 --> 00:34:46.860
tremendous amount of work with
these treaties.

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:50.560
He's argued at great length
that Deuteronomy reworks the

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:54.127
second-millennium Hittite model
in accordance with the

00:34:54.127 --> 00:34:58.097
covenantal patterns that are
evident in the first-millennium

00:34:58.097 --> 00:35:00.519
vassal treaties of Esarhaddon.
 

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:04.674
We see history being used as a
motivational tool and we see

00:35:04.674 --> 00:35:08.224
laws being reinforced by curses;
and it's fascinating,

00:35:08.224 --> 00:35:11.248
if you line up some of the
curses in Esarhaddon's treaties

00:35:11.248 --> 00:35:13.848
with the curses in Deuteronomy,
there's an amazing

00:35:13.848 --> 00:35:16.500
correspondence.
Deuteronomy also includes

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.070
blessings;
the Assyrians didn't do that.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:22.399
Weinfeld notes that the
Assyrian treaties are really

00:35:22.399 --> 00:35:25.206
loyalty oaths that are imposed
upon vassals,

00:35:25.206 --> 00:35:27.230
rather than true covenants.
 

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.078
And Deuteronomy is also
something of a loyalty oath,

00:35:30.078 --> 00:35:33.262
except that the people are
pledging their loyalty to a god

00:35:33.262 --> 00:35:35.050
rather than to a human king.
 

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.470
So you have the exhortation to
love the Lord your God--and

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.934
think back to some of that
language that we heard as I read

00:35:39.934 --> 00:35:42.610
Deuteronomy 30 -- he exhortation
to love the Lord your God,

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.671
to go after God,
to fear God,

00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:48.646
to listen to the voice of God:
these are all typical of

00:35:48.646 --> 00:35:51.896
pledges of loyalty,
and they are paralleled in the

00:35:51.896 --> 00:35:54.751
Assyrian treaties where the
vassal has to love the crown

00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:56.975
prince,
he has to listen to the voice

00:35:56.975 --> 00:35:58.210
of the crown prince.
 

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.590
The same phraseologies are used.
 

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:04.991
So it is a political literary
form, but it's borrowed and it's

00:36:04.991 --> 00:36:08.603
referred to God.
The Assyrian treaties also will

00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:12.708
warn against prophets or
ecstatics or dream interpreters

00:36:12.708 --> 00:36:15.320
who will try to foment sedition.
 

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.118
If you'll notice in Deuteronomy
13 we have something quite

00:36:18.118 --> 00:36:21.211
similar: a warning against false
prophets who will try to foment

00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:23.643
sedition,
and lead the people to the

00:36:23.643 --> 00:36:25.230
worship of other gods.
 

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.398
Some scholars refer to
Deuteronomy as a kind of counter

00:36:28.398 --> 00:36:30.099
treaty, if you will,
right?

00:36:30.099 --> 00:36:33.829
A subversive document that's
trying to shift the people's

00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:36.760
loyalty from the Assyrian
overlord to God,

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.052
the true sovereign,
and it's part of a national

00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:43.369
movement.
Deuteronomy differs in style,

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:47.206
in terminology,
in outlook and in theological

00:36:47.206 --> 00:36:51.480
assumptions from the other books
of the Torah.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.439
As a series of public speeches
it adopts a highly rhetorical

00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:58.315
tone, a very...
sometimes an almost artificial

00:36:58.315 --> 00:37:01.471
style.
It's a style of a very skilled

00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:05.117
preacher almost.
It employs direct address:

00:37:05.117 --> 00:37:07.342
you, you;
sometimes in the singular,

00:37:07.342 --> 00:37:09.914
sometimes in the plural,
but Moses is constantly

00:37:09.914 --> 00:37:12.760
speaking in a very personal
tone, direct address.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.225
And there are all sorts of
hortatory phrases,

00:37:15.225 --> 00:37:18.251
phrases that exhort you:
to do this with all your heart

00:37:18.251 --> 00:37:20.435
and soul,
do this in order that it may go

00:37:20.435 --> 00:37:22.902
well with you.
The land is described as a land

00:37:22.902 --> 00:37:26.028
where milk and honey flow,
and if only you will obey the

00:37:26.028 --> 00:37:27.619
voice of Yahweh your God.
 

00:37:27.619 --> 00:37:29.880
This is the kind of language
that's used here,

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.739
and not so much in the other
books.

00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:35.973
So let's isolate now some of
the major themes of Deuteronomy,

00:37:35.973 --> 00:37:39.219
before we close our study of
the Pentateuch.

00:37:39.219 --> 00:37:42.457
First of all as I've mentioned,
the centralization of the cult:

00:37:42.457 --> 00:37:45.591
that's a key theme in the book
of Deuteronomy and it had very

00:37:45.591 --> 00:37:46.739
important effects.
 

00:37:46.739 --> 00:37:51.287
It brought Judean religion
closer to monotheism because you

00:37:51.287 --> 00:37:55.285
have the insistence of
worshiping one god in his one

00:37:55.285 --> 00:37:57.010
central sanctuary.
 

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:00.773
Sacrifice was offered only on
pilgrimage to Jerusalem,

00:38:00.773 --> 00:38:04.465
which meant that slaughter of
animals for meat in the

00:38:04.465 --> 00:38:08.369
countryside no longer has a
sacral component to it.

00:38:08.369 --> 00:38:12.130
It's just ordinary,
common, profane slaughter.

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.167
There's evidence that that
wasn't true before this reform,

00:38:15.167 --> 00:38:18.311
that if you wanted to kill an
animal for meat you had a kind

00:38:18.311 --> 00:38:20.869
of a makeshift altar out there
in the field,

00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:24.481
and you would pour out the
blood and give it back to God

00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:26.549
and so on.
You might still pour out the

00:38:26.549 --> 00:38:28.743
blood, obviously,
but there was previously a more

00:38:28.743 --> 00:38:29.840
sacral element to it.
 

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.039
Now slaughter in the
countryside was simply common,

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:34.320
profane slaughter.
 

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.286
As a result you have a lot of
rural Levites who are out of

00:38:37.286 --> 00:38:39.524
business now,
a lot of people who would have

00:38:39.524 --> 00:38:42.798
officiated at local shrines,
and they're out of business:

00:38:42.798 --> 00:38:46.302
that probably explains the fact
that Deuteronomy makes special

00:38:46.302 --> 00:38:49.519
provision for the Levites and
includes them in its...

00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:52.146
in legislation,
sort of social welfare

00:38:52.146 --> 00:38:54.504
legislation.
There are provisions that are

00:38:54.504 --> 00:38:56.952
made for the Levites,
who are not going to be able to

00:38:56.952 --> 00:38:59.400
earn their income anymore at
these local shrines.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.604
So many of them would have gone
up to Jerusalem and a real

00:39:02.604 --> 00:39:05.751
tension is going to develop
between the Jerusalem priests

00:39:05.751 --> 00:39:08.449
and this class of Levites who
are newcomers;

00:39:08.449 --> 00:39:11.560
and we'll see some of that
tension played out in some other

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.372
texts.
So centralization of the cult

00:39:13.372 --> 00:39:15.280
and that has some social
ramifications.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:19.280
We also have a greater
abstraction of the deity;

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:22.212
this is something many people
point to in the Book of

00:39:22.212 --> 00:39:25.596
Deuteronomy because Deuteronomy
and books that are related to

00:39:25.596 --> 00:39:28.754
it--those that are going to
follow--consistently refer to

00:39:28.754 --> 00:39:32.251
the sanctuary as the place where
Yahweh chose to cause his name

00:39:32.251 --> 00:39:35.610
to dwell.
God himself isn't said to dwell

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:39.016
in the temple,
nor is the temple described as

00:39:39.016 --> 00:39:41.849
a house of God.
The temple is always the

00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:43.170
dwelling of his name.
 

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:45.460
The house is built for his name.
 

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:49.215
Weinfeld asserts that this is
in order to combat the ancient

00:39:49.215 --> 00:39:52.969
popular belief that God actually
dwells in the sanctuary.

00:39:52.969 --> 00:39:55.762
Likewise to eradicate or guard
against the idea,

00:39:55.762 --> 00:39:58.079
which is implicit in earlier
sources,

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:02.287
that God sits enthroned on the
cherubim, on the cherubim,

00:40:02.287 --> 00:40:05.822
who guard his ark,
Deuteronomy emphasizes that the

00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:08.838
function of the ark is
exclusively to house the

00:40:08.838 --> 00:40:10.720
tablets,
the tablets of the covenant;

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.949
that's its purpose.
 

00:40:11.949 --> 00:40:14.760
The ark cover isn't mentioned,
the cherubim aren't mentioned.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.522
We don't have the image of this
as a throne with the ark as

00:40:17.522 --> 00:40:20.590
God's footstool.
So it seems to be a greater

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.719
abstraction of the deity.
 

00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:25.700
Some abstraction is also
apparent in the shift from

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.204
visual to aural imagery in
describing God's

00:40:28.204 --> 00:40:30.530
self-manifestations or
theophanies.

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:34.210
One hears God but one doesn't
see God, in Deuteronomy.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.758
And that's very different from
earlier texts where we're seeing

00:40:37.758 --> 00:40:40.219
a sort of a cloud encased fire
and so on.

00:40:40.219 --> 00:40:44.442
So the sanctuary is understood
to be a house of worship,

00:40:44.442 --> 00:40:47.130
as much as it is a cultic
center,

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.350
in which Israelites and
foreigners alike may deliver

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.750
prayers to God who dwells in
heaven.

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.869
So he is in heaven;
this is a place of worship.

00:40:55.869 --> 00:40:58.151
That's not to say that
sacrifice is abolished,

00:40:58.151 --> 00:41:00.585
it's not to say that sacrifice
isn't important to

00:41:00.585 --> 00:41:04.203
Deuteronomy--very far from it,
it's an essential part of God's

00:41:04.203 --> 00:41:05.730
service for Deuteronomy.
 

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:10.227
But Deuteronomy is less
interested in cultic matters and

00:41:10.227 --> 00:41:14.887
in any event when it focuses on
sacrifices it focuses on a

00:41:14.887 --> 00:41:18.239
different aspect of those
sacrifices.

00:41:18.239 --> 00:41:21.429
The sacrifices it talks about
consist primarily of offerings

00:41:21.429 --> 00:41:24.239
that are consumed by the offerer
in the sanctuary,

00:41:24.239 --> 00:41:27.065
or are shared with the
disenfranchised in some way:

00:41:27.065 --> 00:41:30.697
the Levite, the resident alien,
the orphan, the widow--portions

00:41:30.697 --> 00:41:31.780
are given to them.
 

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.607
So by emphasizing the
obligation to share the

00:41:34.607 --> 00:41:37.498
sacrificial meal with
disadvantaged members of

00:41:37.498 --> 00:41:40.164
society,
Deuteronomy almost gives the

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:43.817
impression that the primary
purpose of the sacrifice is

00:41:43.817 --> 00:41:46.161
humanitarian,
or at least personal--the

00:41:46.161 --> 00:41:49.036
fulfillment of a religious
obligation or the expression of

00:41:49.036 --> 00:41:50.550
gratitude to God and so on.
 

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.615
These are aspects of the
sacrifices that are emphasized

00:41:53.615 --> 00:41:56.507
in Deuteronomy.
Deuteronomy also emphasizes

00:41:56.507 --> 00:41:59.934
social justice and personal
ethics and neighborly

00:41:59.934 --> 00:42:03.329
responsibility.
God's own righteous behavior on

00:42:03.329 --> 00:42:06.730
behalf of the weak and the
oppressed is a model for

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.840
Israel's righteous behavior.
 

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.930
God assists the orphan,
the widow and the stranger,

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.144
and that's the basis of
Israel's injunction to assist

00:42:15.144 --> 00:42:17.378
them also.
It's the basis for the

00:42:17.378 --> 00:42:20.922
humanitarianism that I mentioned
earlier that seems to run

00:42:20.922 --> 00:42:23.969
through the laws of Deuteronomy
12 through 26.

00:42:23.969 --> 00:42:27.954
A further theme in Deuteronomy
is the fact that the covenant

00:42:27.954 --> 00:42:31.870
concept entails the idea that
each generation of Israelites

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:36.057
understand itself as having been
bound with God in the original

00:42:36.057 --> 00:42:38.862
covenant.
So in Deuteronomy 5:2-3:

00:42:38.862 --> 00:42:42.820
"The Lord our God made a
covenant with us at Horeb .

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.648
It was not with our fathers
that the Lord made this covenant

00:42:45.648 --> 00:42:48.092
but with us, the living,
every one of us who is here

00:42:48.092 --> 00:42:50.167
today."
Now this is interesting because

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:53.161
remember the generation has died
off, that saw the Exodus and

00:42:53.161 --> 00:42:55.382
Sinai, right?
So these are the children now

00:42:55.382 --> 00:42:57.786
and they're saying,
it was us, every one of us who

00:42:57.786 --> 00:42:59.976
is here today.
So every generation of Israel

00:42:59.976 --> 00:43:02.923
is to view itself as standing at
the sacred mountain to conclude

00:43:02.923 --> 00:43:05.959
a covenant with God,
and that decisive moment has to

00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:07.349
be made ever-present.
 

00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:10.522
That's a process that's
facilitated by the obligation to

00:43:10.522 --> 00:43:13.099
study, to study the laws,
to recite them daily,

00:43:13.099 --> 00:43:16.110
to teach them to your children:
these are instructions that are

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.469
contained in Deuteronomy.
 

00:43:17.469 --> 00:43:20.993
Moreover Deuteronomy 31
proclaims that every seventh

00:43:20.993 --> 00:43:25.000
year the Torah is to be read
publicly, the entire thing.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.786
And Weinfeld argues that where
many Ancient Near Eastern

00:43:28.786 --> 00:43:32.710
cultures direct the king to
write the laws for himself,

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:34.537
to read them,
it's only in Israel--he's yet

00:43:34.537 --> 00:43:37.279
to find a parallel--it's only in
Israel that the law is a manual

00:43:37.279 --> 00:43:38.889
for both the king and the
people.

00:43:38.889 --> 00:43:41.462
It's to be proclaimed and read
aloud to the people,

00:43:41.462 --> 00:43:43.519
on a regular basis,
every seven years.

00:43:43.519 --> 00:43:47.619
A further theme of Deuteronomy
is the emphasis on love.

00:43:47.619 --> 00:43:50.877
Weinfeld points out that the
Assyrian treaties stress the

00:43:50.877 --> 00:43:53.030
vassal's love for the crown
prince,

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.924
but there's never a reciprocal
love by the crown prince for the

00:43:56.924 --> 00:43:58.675
vassal.
And Deuteronomy differs in this

00:43:58.675 --> 00:44:00.710
respect.
Deuteronomy emphasizes God's

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:04.455
gracious and undeserved love of
Israel, and that's expressed in

00:44:04.455 --> 00:44:06.750
his mighty acts on Israel's
behalf.

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:10.364
The Deuteronomist makes it
clear that God's great love

00:44:10.364 --> 00:44:13.638
should awaken a reciprocal love
on Israel's part,

00:44:13.638 --> 00:44:16.462
love of God.
Love of God here really means

00:44:16.462 --> 00:44:18.504
loyalty.
The word that is used is a word

00:44:18.504 --> 00:44:19.619
that stresses loyalty.
 

00:44:19.619 --> 00:44:22.168
Love and loyalty are mere
abstractions,

00:44:22.168 --> 00:44:26.260
however, without some sort of
vehicle for their expression;

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:29.496
and the vehicle for their
expression then is God's Torah,

00:44:29.496 --> 00:44:32.502
the sum total of God's
teachings and instructions and

00:44:32.502 --> 00:44:35.756
laws and guidelines,
which are supposed to ensure

00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:38.289
long life and prosperity in the
land.

00:44:38.289 --> 00:44:41.928
That idea is found in a very
important passage known as the

00:44:41.928 --> 00:44:44.609
Shema.
This is a passage that's really

00:44:44.609 --> 00:44:47.470
a central expression of the love
of God in Israel,

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:50.500
 
 

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.106
and it's been singled out as an
essential part of the Jewish

00:44:53.106 --> 00:44:55.143
liturgy, at a very early,
early stage,

00:44:55.143 --> 00:44:57.039
and continues to this day.
 

00:44:57.039 --> 00:45:00.110
It's so called because of the
first word of the passage.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.680
It's in Deuteronomy 6,
it begins in verse 4,

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.370
and the first word is "hear,"
Shema.

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:06.850
Hear, O Israel!
 

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.679
Yahweh is our God, Yahweh alone.
 

00:45:09.679 --> 00:45:12.284
You shall love the Lord your
God with all your heart and with

00:45:12.284 --> 00:45:14.019
all your soul and with all your
might.

00:45:14.019 --> 00:45:16.539
Take to heart these
instructions with which I charge

00:45:16.539 --> 00:45:19.039
you this day.
Impress them upon your children.

00:45:19.039 --> 00:45:21.616
Recite them when you stay at
home and when you are away,

00:45:21.616 --> 00:45:23.489
when you lie down and when you
get up.

00:45:23.489 --> 00:45:26.389
Bind them as a sign on your
hand and let them serve as a

00:45:26.389 --> 00:45:29.312
symbol on your forehead;
inscribe them on the doorposts

00:45:29.312 --> 00:45:31.329
of your house and on your
gates.

00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:34.447
So love and loyalty to God is
the foundation of the Torah but

00:45:34.447 --> 00:45:36.994
Torah is the fulfillment of this
love and loyalty:

00:45:36.994 --> 00:45:40.112
studying it and observing it
and teaching it and transmitting

00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:41.827
it.
Another key idea that occurs in

00:45:41.827 --> 00:45:44.080
Deuteronomy is the idea of
Israel as the chosen people.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:47.099
 
 

00:45:47.099 --> 00:45:50.059
We find it here for the first
time.

00:45:50.059 --> 00:45:53.992
It's an expression of the
particularity of Israel and its

00:45:53.992 --> 00:45:57.087
unique relationship with God,
and that uniqueness is

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.630
expressed by this term,
bachar,

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.340
which means "to elect" or "to
choose."

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.739
This is the first time we
encounter this.

00:46:02.739 --> 00:46:07.564
Yahweh has chosen Israel in an
act of freely bestowed grace and

00:46:07.564 --> 00:46:10.210
love to be his special property.
 

00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:13.846
Deuteronomy 10:14:
Mark, the heavens to

00:46:13.846 --> 00:46:16.291
their uttermost reaches belong
to the Lord your God,

00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:17.969
the earth and all that is on
it!

00:46:17.969 --> 00:46:20.994
Yet it was to your fathers that
the Lord was drawn in His love

00:46:20.994 --> 00:46:24.039
for them, so that He chose you,
their lineal descendents,

00:46:24.039 --> 00:46:26.860
from among all peoples--as is
now the case.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.327
This idea may be rooted in the
Ancient Near Eastern political

00:46:30.327 --> 00:46:33.678
sphere in which sovereigns would
single out vassals for the

00:46:33.678 --> 00:46:37.080
status of special property;
and in fact the word used is a

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.530
word we do find in Exodus.
 

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:42.452
But Deuteronomy contains
statements of national pride,

00:46:42.452 --> 00:46:45.634
national exaltation,
and unlike the Priestly

00:46:45.634 --> 00:46:50.295
materials which portray holiness
as a future goal to be attained

00:46:50.295 --> 00:46:54.809
through the observance of God's
Torah--you shall be holy to me

00:46:54.809 --> 00:46:58.583
by doing the following
things--Deuteronomy speaks of

00:46:58.583 --> 00:47:01.822
Israel as holy now,
and thus bound to the

00:47:01.822 --> 00:47:04.476
observance of God's Torah
because of their holiness:

00:47:04.476 --> 00:47:08.090
you are a holy people to me,
therefore you should do...

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:10.656
So to put it--and this is
perhaps to put it too

00:47:10.656 --> 00:47:13.000
crudely--for P,
for the Priestly source,

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.765
holiness is a goal to be
attained through obedience to

00:47:16.765 --> 00:47:18.908
God's Torah.
For Deuteronomy,

00:47:18.908 --> 00:47:23.214
holiness is a status to be lost
through disobedience to God's

00:47:23.214 --> 00:47:25.234
Torah.
When we come back I just want

00:47:25.234 --> 00:47:28.029
to finish up with one or two
last comments about a couple of

00:47:28.029 --> 00:47:30.588
key ideas or themes in
Deuteronomy before we move on to

00:47:30.588 --> 00:47:32.862
the beginning of the
Deuteronomistic history that

00:47:32.862 --> 00:47:34.000
starts in Joshua.
 

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.915
This coming week you'll be
having midterms as part of your

00:47:37.915 --> 00:47:40.662
section meeting and in addition
at 6 p.m.

00:47:40.662 --> 00:47:44.578
tonight I'll be making the
essay question available online

00:47:44.578 --> 00:47:47.943
and if it gets to 6:01 and
there's nothing online,

00:47:47.943 --> 00:47:50.760
somebody call me real fast,
okay?

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:54.440
All right, good,
thanks, and good luck with the

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.000
exam.

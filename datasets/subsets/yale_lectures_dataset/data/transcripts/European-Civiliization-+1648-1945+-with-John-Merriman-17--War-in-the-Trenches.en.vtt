00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.490
Prof: We're going to
talk about the war today.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.800
Let's do that.
 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.915
I assume that you guys all saw
Paths of Glory,

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:12.110
so I'm going to talk about the
mutinies in a while.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.646
Jay Winter is going to talk
about essentially the Great War

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:19.460
in modern memory.
 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.260
To make a nice transition to
his lecture,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.562
I'm going to end with something
that he wrote about how reality

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:33.010
and art came together in a
terrifying way in 1918.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.410
Okay.
 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.230
Now--;comment faire
ça?

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.513
Qu'est ce qu'on va
faire?--so,

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:44.250
just a few things at the
beginning that are obvious.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.530
They're in the book.
 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.130
It didn't work out the way
Schlieffen wanted it to.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.536
The point about the invasion of
Belgium was that it brought

00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:00.679
Britain into the war.
 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.108
The Germans were counting on
the fact that it would take

00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:06.664
Britain a very,
very long time to raise an

00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:09.468
army, not a navy but an army of
any size.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.697
What they called the British
Expeditionary Force does arrive

00:01:12.697 --> 00:01:14.938
and takes its place next to the
French.

00:01:14.938 --> 00:01:17.811
But it's very small and they
don't have conscription until

00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:18.720
late in the war.
 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.897
Unlike the French,
they did not have military

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:21.640
conscription.
 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.200
Basically, to make a long story
short,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.560
in part because Germany,
as France,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.390
as everybody was worried about
the home front,

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.321
basically what happens is they
hurt their chances of pulling

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:42.667
this off by moving some
divisions to Alsace to try to

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:44.840
blunt the force there.
 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.739
Also, some more are headed off
to the eastern front,

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:51.336
because they start to realize
that the Russians are mobilizing

00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:53.209
more rapidly than they thought
they could.

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:59.851
Basically, it's possible to
argue that the Battle of the

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:04.319
Marne saves Paris and saves
France.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:08.590
Schlieffen would have gone
crazy about this.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.270
Remember, the last thing he
said supposedly in his life was,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.241
"Let the last soldier
touch the English Channel and

00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:16.240
then come down and hit
Paris."

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.092
But they turned down before
that, and the first airplanes

00:02:20.092 --> 00:02:22.568
are used as reconnaissance
planes.

00:02:22.568 --> 00:02:26.282
The pilots literally had to
carry pistols with them at the

00:02:26.282 --> 00:02:27.389
very beginning.
 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.986
They had not figured out a way
to put machine guns on that the

00:02:30.986 --> 00:02:34.288
bullets wouldn't hit the
propeller and then come back and

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:35.410
kill the pilot.
 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.340
So, all this took some doing.
 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.280
But the first planes were
reconnaissance planes.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.620
At one point in this huge
engagement featuring enormous

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.128
armies,
in the German case supplied by

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:52.160
trains going many every hour
across the Rhine,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.912
the French planes see that
there's a big gap in the German

00:02:58.912 --> 00:02:59.860
lines.
 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.938
So, they counter attack in the
famous story everybody knows.

00:03:02.938 --> 00:03:06.492
Again, what I want to insist on
is--look at where it says Battle

00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:07.340
of the Marne.
 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.139
There's a town called Lagny
there.

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.038
Now it's practically a suburb
of Paris, L-A-G-N-Y.

00:03:12.038 --> 00:03:17.068
You could hear the battle in
Paris.

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:21.158
You could hear the roll of
thunder of the guns.

00:03:21.158 --> 00:03:24.656
When you ask how the French
home front holds together so

00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:27.389
long, it's that the Germans are
so close.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.288
In 1918, they will be close
again.

00:03:29.288 --> 00:03:31.728
In 1918, they're firing this
huge gun which the British

00:03:31.728 --> 00:03:33.580
soldiers called "Big
Bertha."

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.780
It's lobbing from way,
way the hell up in the north.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.315
It's lobbing shells from behind
the German lines all the way to

00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:43.508
Paris on Easter Sunday 1918.
 

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:47.068
It hit an apartment house on
the Church of Saint Gervais,

00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:49.180
another hit an apartment house
on the Boulevard Port Royal,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.720
one on the Rue de Rivoli not
too far from our place.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.318
The Germans are so close.
 

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:59.086
But in 1914 what happens is
that literally the commander of

00:03:59.086 --> 00:04:01.229
Paris, whose name was Gallieni.
 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.939
He has a métro stop
named after him.

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.689
A lot of these guys do.
 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:08.968
He commandeers the Paris taxis.
 

00:04:08.968 --> 00:04:12.319
They are literally carrying
soldiers out to the front at the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.568
Battle of the Marne.
 

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:16.776
What happens is the Battle of
the Marne stops the German

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:19.459
advance and then the race to the
sea begins.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.680
They try to outflank each other.
 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.771
Again, to borrow a ridiculous
football analogy,

00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:25.089
but it's not so ridiculous.
 

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:26.629
It doesn't matter if you don't
follow football.

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.660
If you're trying to get around
the outside before the outside

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.221
linebacker can get there and
you're trying to turn the

00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:34.959
corner.
 

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.610
Basically, that's what they're
trying to do.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.978
Both sides are trying to turn
the corner and they end up at

00:04:39.978 --> 00:04:40.560
the sea.
 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.862
At that point,
the trenches are dug literally

00:04:44.862 --> 00:04:48.970
from the sea all the way to
Switzerland.

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.149
The war, to repeat what I said
the other day,

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:59.634
only a couple people who had
seen what was going on in the

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:04.511
Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905
could have imagined this war in

00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:09.310
which the offense was supposed
to have, as in 1870-1871,

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.769
every advantage.
 

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:15.331
Remember the French commander
said élan vital,

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:18.110
"We need the frenetic
patriotic energy.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.230
That's all we need.
 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.079
We need to attack and keep on
attacking."

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:23.189
It doesn't work out that way.
 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.290
The reason that you have all of
these millions of people killed,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.028
the flower of British youth,
the flower of every youth in

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:33.874
that period,
is because this offense war

00:05:33.874 --> 00:05:38.737
becomes a defensive struggle in
which breaking through is almost

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:40.589
literally impossible.
 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:46.949
Thus, backdrop to what you have
seen in Paths of Glory.

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.730
The weapons of the war
including the shelling,

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:57.788
most people are killed by
shells in World War I than dying

00:05:57.788 --> 00:06:00.019
in any other way.
 

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:02.555
There are new and horrible ways
of dying, flame throwers,

00:06:02.555 --> 00:06:03.778
for example,
poison gas,

00:06:03.778 --> 00:06:06.149
which is first used by the
Germans at Ypres,

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:07.579
on of the many battles of Ypres.
 

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:11.980
There are twelve battles of the
same river in northern Italy.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.088
There are several battles of
the Somme.

00:06:15.088 --> 00:06:18.976
These battles keep on
happening, because large chunks

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:22.939
of real estate are virtually
impossible to conquer.

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:27.519
So, trenches are defensive
weapons.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:31.327
One of the reasons that the
breakthrough is impossible is

00:06:31.327 --> 00:06:35.750
that when you're going to try to
break through these trenches,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.550
what they have is what they
call creeping barrages.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.069
They start trying to--and lots
of people died with what the

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:45.406
Americans call friendly
fire--they try to coordinate the

00:06:45.406 --> 00:06:49.108
shelling to go in advance of the
people going over the top and

00:06:49.108 --> 00:06:52.386
then trying to carry sixty
pounds--pick up sixty pounds

00:06:52.386 --> 00:06:55.300
some time--worth of stuff on
your back,

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.764
and go down into these horrible
craters full of all sorts of

00:06:59.764 --> 00:07:01.649
crap,
and dead floating rats,

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:04.240
and dead floating bodies of
human beings,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.560
and to try to break through.
 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.040
Then you run into machine guns.
 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.180
Machine guns which can fire
what?

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.199
I just saw this morning or last
night.

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.649
I think it's 600 rounds a
minute.

00:07:15.649 --> 00:07:19.095
The Gatling guns had first been
used in, I think,

00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:20.889
the American Civil War.
 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:22.870
But these are much more rapid
firing.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.949
They aim basically at your
knees.

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:28.250
They just sort of go back and
forth, back and forth.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.490
Then barbed wire.
 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.819
One of the things that soldiers
had to carry with them were wire

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:32.189
cutters.
 

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:34.423
Sometimes the wire cutters
weren't equal to the task of

00:07:34.423 --> 00:07:35.209
cutting the wire.
 

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:38.947
It's hard to cut wire if people
are firing machine guns at you

00:07:38.947 --> 00:07:39.560
as well.
 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.928
That's why the trenches,
which you'll see some real ones

00:07:44.928 --> 00:07:50.199
in a minute, are fairly
elaborate defensive weapons.

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:53.120
Everybody has seen the footage
of real battle.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.185
Sometimes--they've wrecked it,
but the Imperial War Museum,

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.985
which used to be much better
than it is now in London,

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:00.730
but it's really worth seeing.
 

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.528
They used to have this amazing
small clip.

00:08:02.528 --> 00:08:05.750
You see these three guys and
they're about ready to go.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.610
One guy blows his whistle to
say, "Follow me."

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.040
The first guy goes up and he
gets his head over.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:12.410
Then he's dead.
 

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:13.269
He falls back.
 

00:08:13.269 --> 00:08:14.920
The second guy goes up and he
gets a little further.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.338
Then you see his body hit.
 

00:08:16.338 --> 00:08:18.749
The third guy,
when the clip ends,

00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:20.720
is just about to get out.
 

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.180
You don't know what happens to
him, but his chances weren't

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.689
very good.
 

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:26.430
Breaking through.
 

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.113
There are debates on how
ridiculous these people like

00:08:31.113 --> 00:08:34.716
Nivelle were,
or Foch, and Joffre and the

00:08:34.716 --> 00:08:39.850
whole gang, because they keep
ordering these attacks.

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.409
"The breakthrough is going
to come next.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:42.330
We've really got them.
 

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:43.320
We're going to break
through."

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.500
But they don't break through.
 

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.039
And they don't break through.
 

00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:48.399
They can't break through.
 

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:53.950
That is background for the
mutinies.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.457
The first real breakthrough
doesn't come until March,

00:08:58.457 --> 00:09:02.100
1918, in the Ludendorff
offensive, 1918.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.370
Then they overrun their
supplies, and it kind of snaps

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:10.158
back like a rubber band and
pushes them back.

00:09:10.158 --> 00:09:11.200
The Germans,
at that point,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.519
for reasons I'll explain in a
minute, know that they're not

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.519
going to win the war.
 

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:16.070
They can't win the war.
 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.120
What's going to happen is that
when the war ends,

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.100
and more about this when we
talk about the post-war,

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.558
is that the war ends with
German troops far inside France.

00:09:24.558 --> 00:09:26.480
How do you explain that back to
the home front?

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.080
The Berlin home front has
started to collapse.

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.625
There's great deprivation,
great problems getting enough

00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:37.370
to eat.
 

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.644
And that situation,
that will make it easier,

00:09:39.644 --> 00:09:41.145
later,
for Hitler and many other

00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:43.830
little would-be Hitlers to argue
that you were winning,

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.309
but you were stabbed in the
back by the Jews,

00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:46.649
and the Communists,
and the Socialists,

00:09:46.649 --> 00:09:49.139
and the peaceniks,
and all of these people,

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:51.820
from their point of view.
 

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.369
When you do these creeping
barrages, you're indicating

00:09:55.369 --> 00:09:57.779
where the attack is going to
come.

00:09:57.779 --> 00:10:00.994
Behind the trenches the
Germans, as do the French,

00:10:00.994 --> 00:10:04.929
have railroad lines that are
used to bring in reinforcements,

00:10:04.929 --> 00:10:06.570
to bring in supplies.
 

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.159
What you do is you bring in
supplies.

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:10.340
You bring in reinforcements.
 

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:17.883
If you read a great book by
Paul Fussell called The Great

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:24.658
War in Modern Memory,
it's about the war poets.

00:10:24.658 --> 00:10:27.703
It's about Siegfried Sassoon,
and Wilfred Owen,

00:10:27.703 --> 00:10:29.159
and folks like that.
 

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:31.548
Eisenberg, I quote him.
 

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:33.730
I think one of his poems is in
the book.

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.048
That is an amazing look at the
whole thing.

00:10:37.048 --> 00:10:41.136
That's a ready-made paper
topic, to take a couple of those

00:10:41.136 --> 00:10:43.360
poems and talk about the war.
 

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:49.289
Breaking through is very,
very difficult.

00:10:49.289 --> 00:10:51.159
It's almost impossible.
 

00:10:51.159 --> 00:10:53.779
That's why you have the carnage.
 

00:10:53.779 --> 00:10:56.315
That's why you have,
as I said the very first day if

00:10:56.315 --> 00:10:58.938
you were here,
that there were more British

00:10:58.938 --> 00:11:03.024
soldiers killed or seriously
wounded in the first three days

00:11:03.024 --> 00:11:06.278
of the Battle of the Somme,
like the river,

00:11:06.278 --> 00:11:08.519
than there were Americans
killed in World War I,

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:09.909
Korea,
and Vietnam.

00:11:09.909 --> 00:11:13.379
In three days.
 

00:11:13.379 --> 00:11:16.570
The first three days.
 

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.418
You're talking about horrific
losses.

00:11:19.418 --> 00:11:22.298
You're talking about an
expectation.

00:11:22.298 --> 00:11:23.750
Try to put yourself in the same
thing.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.850
I think I have that quote in
there.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.596
Somebody said,
"You discuss your own

00:11:27.596 --> 00:11:30.259
death as if you were discussing
a lunch that you were planning

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:31.090
tomorrow."
 

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.650
Someone else said,
"I didn't want to die,

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.561
at least until I'd finished
reading The Return of the

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.288
Native."
 

00:11:35.288 --> 00:11:41.058
That, again,
is background for the mutinies.

00:11:41.058 --> 00:11:43.980
What is amazing is that--;and
again,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.830
the French situation because of
the precariousness--it's

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.094
difficult to explain how people
could have continued to fight in

00:11:50.094 --> 00:11:50.820
many ways.
 

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:53.366
Again, looking at the
Austro-Hungarian Empire where

00:11:53.366 --> 00:11:54.538
they had huge losses.
 

00:11:54.538 --> 00:11:58.495
The armies hold together,
really, until 1917 and even

00:11:58.495 --> 00:12:01.308
beyond the Austro-Hungarian
Empire.

00:12:01.308 --> 00:12:03.528
The Russian case,
too, is remarkable.

00:12:03.528 --> 00:12:08.840
The Battle of Tannenberg is
just an amazing battle in 1914.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.320
There are so many casualties
they couldn't even count them.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.538
There's so many people dead.
 

00:12:14.538 --> 00:12:15.830
There had never been a war like
this.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.918
No one had ever seen,
couldn't have imagined a war

00:12:17.918 --> 00:12:18.428
like this.
 

00:12:18.428 --> 00:12:21.071
The proximity,
also, the English had the

00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:23.778
advantage of having the channel
there.

00:12:23.778 --> 00:12:26.145
But it's one of these,
if you've been to Victoria

00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:29.005
Station, it's one of these
things they always say about the

00:12:29.005 --> 00:12:30.139
war, but it's true.
 

00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:32.409
You go to the officer's club in
Victoria Station,

00:12:32.409 --> 00:12:35.292
have a decent lunch,
knock down a couple pints of

00:12:35.292 --> 00:12:38.231
beer,
and you're on the front and can

00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:40.389
be dead by early evening.
 

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:45.600
It is said that in Kent,
where the miners,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.711
these Welsh miners in Belgium,
they tunnel under this sort of

00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:55.360
promontory that's sticking up,
that's a defensive position for

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.330
the Germans.
 

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.976
They bring in all these
munitions and they blow the

00:12:59.976 --> 00:13:00.779
thing up.
 

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.220
They blow this huge thing up.
 

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.293
In Kent supposedly it is said
that people in Kent on and near

00:13:06.293 --> 00:13:10.028
the coast of the English Channel
could actually hear the

00:13:10.028 --> 00:13:10.980
explosion.
 

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.090
The war is that close.
 

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.600
Of course, it's close in other
ways.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.970
Imagine that you lived in a
village in France or anywhere.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.964
The facteur,
or, in our case,

00:13:23.964 --> 00:13:27.899
the factrice,
the mail carrier comes.

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:31.884
What you don't want to see is
you don't want the mail carrier

00:13:31.884 --> 00:13:33.480
to come to your house.
 

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.048
You don't want mail.
 

00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:39.700
He would be carrying a telegram
saying,

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.025
"Be proud of X,
who has just died for"

00:13:43.025 --> 00:13:45.534
you fill in the
country--Turkey,

00:13:45.534 --> 00:13:48.288
Bulgaria, Romania,
France, Germany,

00:13:48.288 --> 00:13:50.970
Russia, Britain,
anywhere.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.586
So, it became a war like no
other war, with the only

00:13:55.586 --> 00:13:59.480
possible exception the Spanish
Civil War.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.506
It has given birth to really
the greatest writing about

00:14:04.506 --> 00:14:08.509
arguably any war,
certainly, in history,

00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:12.308
and arguably any events outside
of maybe the rise of Hitler and

00:14:12.308 --> 00:14:14.269
National Socialism in Germany.
 

00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:16.759
It was like that.
 

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:22.440
It really couldn't have been
any other way.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:26.129
They're still arguing over
these battles.

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:28.702
Passchendaele,
we once drove up--Passchendaele

00:14:28.702 --> 00:14:32.019
was one of these places that
they first used poison gas.

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:35.336
Now it's a lot of
lotissements,

00:14:35.336 --> 00:14:39.279
in Belgium, a lot of housing
developments.

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:40.990
I just wanted to go and see
there.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:45.549
You can't even see there where
the hell that was Passchendaele

00:14:45.549 --> 00:14:47.120
was actually there.
 

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.094
If you're going to go see these
battlefields,

00:14:50.094 --> 00:14:53.676
the one to go to is Verdun,
which I'll talk about in a

00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:54.418
minute.
 

00:14:54.418 --> 00:14:59.485
There you can go through these
forts, Douaumont and Vaux,

00:14:59.485 --> 00:15:02.019
to imagine what it's like.
 

00:15:02.019 --> 00:15:05.014
You can see some places where
they've left,

00:15:05.014 --> 00:15:06.940
in the winds,
and the mists,

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:10.149
and the terrible--of that part
of France.

00:15:10.149 --> 00:15:15.446
The one road going from Bar Le
Duc, on the sacred road,

00:15:15.446 --> 00:15:17.308
supplying Verdun.
 

00:15:17.308 --> 00:15:21.703
You still see there's one place
where they've left the guns with

00:15:21.703 --> 00:15:22.889
their bayonets.
 

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.899
There was a lot of hand-to-hand
fighting there.

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:27.235
That's the place where
Falkenhayn said,

00:15:27.235 --> 00:15:29.754
"We can afford to lose
more children,

00:15:29.754 --> 00:15:32.090
more young people,
more young men.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.139
We will simply outbleed
them."

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:38.729
He hurdles one attack after
another over most of 1916

00:15:38.729 --> 00:15:40.230
against Verdun.
 

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:44.759
That's where so many people die.
 

00:15:44.759 --> 00:15:52.692
Of course, that is the
background also for these

00:15:52.692 --> 00:15:54.549
mutinies.
 

00:15:54.549 --> 00:15:55.840
Okay.
 

00:16:06.528 --> 00:16:14.269
Here's the western front in
1915-1917.

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:17.678
You can see that it really
doesn't move at all.

00:16:17.678 --> 00:16:20.379
Again, there is Paris and there
is fighting.

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:23.571
By the way, these places like
Reims, with the beautiful

00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:26.879
cathedral which was rebuilt
thanks to the Americans after

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:27.590
the war.
 

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.328
The Carnegie family gave a lot
of money, and ordinary people

00:16:30.328 --> 00:16:31.490
rebuilt the cathedrals.
 

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.990
One of the great cathedrals
anywhere in Europe.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.038
Reims was right on the line.
 

00:16:35.038 --> 00:16:36.928
Of course, Reims just got
pounded.

00:16:36.928 --> 00:16:39.220
The whole place was just
totally devastated.

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:48.110
Arras, there's another example
up there, right on the line.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.383
I can't remember on the first
day or not if I didn't relate a

00:16:51.383 --> 00:16:56.120
story of people that we knew,
now about eight years ago,

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.399
who were actually killed
because of World War I.

00:16:58.399 --> 00:16:59.980
They were killed.
 

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.240
There's a family we knew who
were cousins of really good

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.910
friends of ours that would come
down there.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:09.029
There was a boy the age of my
daughter then.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.650
I guess he was twelve then.
 

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:16.038
We met them and we had a good
time talking to them.

00:17:16.038 --> 00:17:18.825
Then I asked how they were at
Thanksgiving when I went over at

00:17:18.825 --> 00:17:19.509
Thanksgiving.
 

00:17:19.509 --> 00:17:21.520
In France we don't celebrate
Thanksgiving,

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.140
but I had ten days,
so why not?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.480
They were dead.
 

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.483
Not the father,
but the son and the mother had

00:17:27.483 --> 00:17:29.420
been killed by World War I.
 

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.718
Their house was right in Arras
and in the basement they had a

00:17:33.718 --> 00:17:34.220
fire.
 

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:37.231
This was just a few--you were
ten years old when this

00:17:37.231 --> 00:17:37.869
happened.
 

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:39.230
This was World War I.
 

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.130
Still killing.
 

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.308
They were killed because there
was a fire in their basement.

00:17:43.308 --> 00:17:46.567
They didn't know that on the
other side of the wall were all

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:49.990
these munitions stocked right
near the front on World War I.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:51.740
The fire caught and it blew up
the house.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:55.817
The father wasn't there and
this little guy and his mother

00:17:55.817 --> 00:17:59.538
were killed, were blown up,
killed by World War I.

00:17:59.538 --> 00:18:02.460
In the 1920s there were people
killed all the time.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:05.651
Every couple of weeks--you
still see in the paper now that

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:08.842
they found a bomb in Berlin from
World War II from all the

00:18:08.842 --> 00:18:11.232
bombing,
or in Dresden and in all these

00:18:11.232 --> 00:18:12.009
other places.
 

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:14.667
In World War I,
there were constantly farmers

00:18:14.667 --> 00:18:17.390
who were blown up as they were
plowing, constantly,

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.817
as they were plowing on these
battlefields around the Chemin

00:18:20.817 --> 00:18:22.269
des Dames, for example.
 

00:18:22.269 --> 00:18:25.130
You can see the Somme there.
 

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:27.338
That's a good one to have there.
 

00:18:27.338 --> 00:18:29.680
But the Chemin des Dames is up
near there.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.348
It's north of Soissons.
 

00:18:31.348 --> 00:18:33.404
Anyway, if you go to any of
those

00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:40.259
départements,
if you go to the Marne,

00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:42.910
which is where the Somme
basically was,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.410
or in the Pas de Calais,
which is Picardie there,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:51.845
there are just fields and
fields of these cemeteries there

00:18:51.845 --> 00:18:55.660
with hundreds of thousands of
crosses.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.288
One can go on and on about
this, but there had never been

00:18:58.288 --> 00:18:59.180
anything like it.
 

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.710
So, war became the dominant
experience in the lives of

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.420
Europeans, period.
 

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:10.298
No matter how old you were,
you knew somebody who died.

00:19:10.298 --> 00:19:14.809
You had a relative who died,
period.

00:19:14.809 --> 00:19:18.054
There are in France,
where much of the fighting

00:19:18.054 --> 00:19:20.990
was--the western front fighting
was there,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.680
and in Belgium,
there are 36,000 communes,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.848
which is an administrative
unit, 36,000.

00:19:27.848 --> 00:19:33.788
Twelve out of 36,000 had nobody
killed in World War I.

00:19:33.788 --> 00:19:36.798
There are places you can go,
particularly if you're in the

00:19:36.798 --> 00:19:38.700
south of France,
where you can go.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.598
They were all taken.
 

00:19:41.598 --> 00:19:44.226
People who were skilled
workers, who could work in

00:19:44.226 --> 00:19:46.210
munitions factories,
could get out.

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.838
There were a lot of tensions
between rural and urban people,

00:19:48.838 --> 00:19:51.942
because urban people who had
rationing problems said,

00:19:51.942 --> 00:19:54.415
"Oh,
the rural people are hoarding

00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:56.960
their products"
and stuff like that.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.365
But there are places you can go
where you see these,

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:00.309
and I'm a counter.
 

00:20:00.309 --> 00:20:01.450
I count things all the time.
 

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.190
It's maddening.
 

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.180
You'll find there's one town
where seventy-four people died.

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.240
A very small town in the south
of France, in the Aveyron.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.720
There are hardly seventy-four
houses.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.368
There's a village that's quite
beautiful.

00:20:12.368 --> 00:20:15.599
It's a twelfth century church
way up in the Cévennes

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:17.548
mountains where we take
tourists.

00:20:17.548 --> 00:20:22.383
When you walk there,
the monument to the dead is

00:20:22.383 --> 00:20:24.440
inside the church.
 

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:29.268
When you show people this
beautiful Renaissance entryway,

00:20:29.268 --> 00:20:33.234
portail,
there's twelve people killed in

00:20:33.234 --> 00:20:34.269
the war.
 

00:20:34.269 --> 00:20:35.880
You cannot count.
 

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.990
There aren't twelve houses.
 

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.849
You can't count twelve houses.
 

00:20:38.849 --> 00:20:40.319
People don't live there anymore.
 

00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:41.538
Hardly anyone's there.
 

00:20:41.538 --> 00:20:44.915
We know more about the western
front and now there's some good

00:20:44.915 --> 00:20:47.130
books appearing on the eastern
front,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.515
but it's the same thing in
every country that you're

00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:48.950
talking about.
 

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:53.557
The numbers of people killed
around will make clear what the

00:20:53.557 --> 00:20:57.230
countries were that really
suffered the most.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.736
They were Germany and France,
followed by Russia,

00:21:01.736 --> 00:21:03.519
but also Britain.
 

00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:04.538
Don't forget Britain.
 

00:21:04.538 --> 00:21:07.808
Remember I said four empires
disappear?

00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:10.839
The fifth empire arguably
disappears in the end,

00:21:10.839 --> 00:21:13.420
because of dynamics caused by
the war.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.333
People in the so-called
colonies fighting for the

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:18.458
British Empire,
they began to think,

00:21:18.458 --> 00:21:21.190
"Why shouldn't we have
independence?

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:22.900
Why shouldn't we have freedom,
too?"

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.368
Of course, at the Battle of
Gallipoli,

00:21:25.368 --> 00:21:27.876
which is one of the great
tragedies of the war when

00:21:27.876 --> 00:21:30.058
Churchill,
who had ten ideas a day and

00:21:30.058 --> 00:21:33.272
nine of them were bad,
as one of his critics said,

00:21:33.272 --> 00:21:35.719
Churchill said,
"We'll take the pressure

00:21:35.719 --> 00:21:35.940
off.
 

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.808
We'll knock the Turks out of
the war."

00:21:38.808 --> 00:21:41.887
They're going to have this
impossible assault on Turkish

00:21:41.887 --> 00:21:43.118
fortified positions.
 

00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:45.808
They said, "We'll knock
them out of the war with the

00:21:45.808 --> 00:21:48.450
Australians, and the Indians,
and the New Zealanders.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:52.210
We can afford to lose them more
easily.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.868
They're not really ours."
 

00:21:53.868 --> 00:21:58.019
Of course, that still resonates
in places like New Zealand,

00:21:58.019 --> 00:22:01.308
and Australia,
and India, as well it should.

00:22:01.308 --> 00:22:03.354
Anyway, that's another
complicated story,

00:22:03.354 --> 00:22:04.990
and we have other stuff to do.
 

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.730
Read things on this.
 

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:12.460
It is a phenomenal thing.
 

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.400
Mutinies.
 

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.680
Just a little bit to the
mutinies.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.910
The Somme you can read about,
and all of that.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.150
When I used to work at
Vincennes,

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.319
in the military archives there,
because I was writing about

00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:27.240
1830 and 1848 and all that
stuff,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.311
I was reading day by day the
correspondence from various

00:22:30.311 --> 00:22:31.430
regions in France.
 

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:36.075
I was trying to find these
documents that I knew were

00:22:36.075 --> 00:22:36.788
there.
 

00:22:36.788 --> 00:22:38.640
This was when I was just
starting out.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:39.890
I wasn't much older than you
guys.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.798
I'd like to think that.
 

00:22:41.798 --> 00:22:48.442
Younger than I once was,
but anyway, whatever the song

00:22:48.442 --> 00:22:49.069
is.
 

00:22:49.069 --> 00:22:50.538
And I knew the stuff was there.
 

00:22:50.538 --> 00:22:54.058
The person that ran it was out
having sort of a torrid affair

00:22:54.058 --> 00:22:55.759
with this guy all the time.
 

00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:57.338
So, she was never there at
lunch.

00:22:57.338 --> 00:22:58.690
And she didn't know what she
was doing anyway.

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:03.192
I bribed one of the guards to
let me back in the stacks where

00:23:03.192 --> 00:23:06.720
you're not supposed to go in
French archives.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.088
But the guy was a stamp
collector and I knew that.

00:23:11.088 --> 00:23:13.078
So, I kept leaving all these
jazzy stamps on my table.

00:23:13.078 --> 00:23:14.962
Finally he said,
"Oh, those are beautiful

00:23:14.962 --> 00:23:15.339
stamps.
 

00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:16.400
"Would you like them?"
 

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.278
The next thing I knew I'm in
the back.

00:23:18.278 --> 00:23:22.259
I remember what I saw was this
huge thing of boxes.

00:23:22.259 --> 00:23:23.848
This is in the mid-1970s.
 

00:23:23.848 --> 00:23:27.170
This huge number of boxes that
were literally chained up.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.548
They were in this cage and they
were chained up,

00:23:30.548 --> 00:23:34.217
really chained up with big
locks and all that stuff,

00:23:34.217 --> 00:23:35.440
big security.
 

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.710
I said, "What's all
that?"

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:38.460
He said, "Those are the
mutiny documents.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.618
Those are the documents from
the mutinies in 1917."

00:23:41.618 --> 00:23:45.009
Now, finally,
a guy was able to get in,

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:46.939
because in France there's a
fifty-year rule and he should

00:23:46.939 --> 00:23:48.588
have been able,
fifty years after the fact,

00:23:48.588 --> 00:23:50.029
he should be able to consult
documents.

00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:55.326
This guy was finally able to
get exception to go work on

00:23:55.326 --> 00:23:57.058
these documents.
 

00:23:57.058 --> 00:23:59.258
So, the thesis that was
published is very good,

00:23:59.258 --> 00:24:01.598
by a guy called Guy Pedroncini,
whom I don't know,

00:24:01.598 --> 00:24:02.890
and it's on the mutiny.
 

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.640
Now we know about the mutinies.
 

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.497
What do we know about the
mutinies that confirms what you

00:24:10.497 --> 00:24:12.380
saw in the film?
 

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.289
Several things.
 

00:24:15.289 --> 00:24:17.798
The mutinies spread rapidly.
 

00:24:17.798 --> 00:24:20.586
They did, indeed,
begin with soldiers who were

00:24:20.586 --> 00:24:23.250
being sent the front baa-ing
like sheep,

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:25.380
as if they were being sent to a
slaughterhouse,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.618
because that's what they're
being sent to.

00:24:26.618 --> 00:24:30.520
What's the difference between a
soldier carrying sixty pounds of

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.298
equipment going to some attack
that's going to go nowhere,

00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:36.848
where his chances of being
killed are enormous,

00:24:36.848 --> 00:24:40.180
and sheep being led to a
slaughterhouse?

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:41.048
What is the difference?
 

00:24:41.048 --> 00:24:44.634
Really not much,
except you're dealing with a

00:24:44.634 --> 00:24:47.078
human being and not a sheep.
 

00:24:47.078 --> 00:24:51.358
That was a bad sign for these
officers.

00:24:51.358 --> 00:24:54.613
When the mutinies started,
there were only really four

00:24:54.613 --> 00:24:57.375
reliable divisions,
they figured at one point,

00:24:57.375 --> 00:24:59.769
between Paris and the German
lines.

00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:03.098
The incredible thing was--is
because soldiers never talk

00:25:03.098 --> 00:25:05.338
about the battle when they go
back.

00:25:05.338 --> 00:25:07.108
They don't talk about the
battle.

00:25:07.108 --> 00:25:11.880
It was impossible to
communicate what was going on.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.609
The mutinies were one of the
well-kept secrets.

00:25:15.609 --> 00:25:16.759
Nobody knew.
 

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:18.119
The Germans didn't know at the
time.

00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:19.420
Hardly anybody knew.
 

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.568
Nobody is probably too strong.
 

00:25:21.568 --> 00:25:25.771
The mutinies involved
thousands, and thousands,

00:25:25.771 --> 00:25:28.328
and thousands of soldiers.
 

00:25:28.328 --> 00:25:31.140
In some cases they elected
people to represent them.

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:36.002
In a few cases where the
officers maintained the upper

00:25:36.002 --> 00:25:39.490
hand, they summarily shot
mutineers.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:43.789
Do you say mutineers?
 

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:45.039
I don't know, people who mutiny.
 

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:46.849
I confuse these things.
 

00:25:46.849 --> 00:25:50.650
They were massive.
 

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:57.035
But they had nothing to do with
socialist, or anarchist,

00:25:57.035 --> 00:26:00.750
or pacifist propaganda at all.
 

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.059
There were attempts.
 

00:26:02.059 --> 00:26:03.150
There were congresses.
 

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:04.660
There was a congress in Sweden.
 

00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.190
There was another one in
Switzerland.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.346
The French government would not
let representatives go to those

00:26:09.346 --> 00:26:10.009
congresses.
 

00:26:10.009 --> 00:26:14.112
The first reaction in the high
command was that,

00:26:14.112 --> 00:26:19.700
"Well, the socialists are
now showing their true stripes.

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:22.618
Anarchist propaganda is
working."

00:26:22.618 --> 00:26:24.170
Look at the Bolshevik
Revolution.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.500
It had not yet happened.
 

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:28.016
That was in October,
but the Russian Revolution in

00:26:28.016 --> 00:26:29.660
February had already occurred.
 

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.269
It has nothing to do with it.
 

00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:34.477
What they objected to,
they were not defeatists at

00:26:34.477 --> 00:26:34.868
all.
 

00:26:34.868 --> 00:26:37.108
They did not want the Germans
to win the war.

00:26:37.108 --> 00:26:40.526
But they realized that they
weren't going to win the war

00:26:40.526 --> 00:26:43.880
either and that this strategy
was completely futile.

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.259
There were cases of
fraternization.

00:26:47.259 --> 00:26:48.630
They are very famous cases.
 

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:52.633
Christmas 1914,
on the front way up near

00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:57.150
Belgium, on the British side
particularly.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.731
They start yelling back and
forth, the Germans and the

00:26:59.731 --> 00:27:00.220
British.
 

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.108
They say basically,
"Screw this stuff.

00:27:02.108 --> 00:27:04.140
Why don't we take the day
off?"

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:07.839
So, the Welsh were singing
Christmas carols to the Germans

00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:11.605
and the Germans were getting
their best singers and singing

00:27:11.605 --> 00:27:12.190
back.
 

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:16.630
They actually did get together
and play a soccer game.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:19.808
They found a place that wasn't
totally chopped up and played.

00:27:19.808 --> 00:27:23.317
In 1915 on Christmas a British
soldier said,

00:27:23.317 --> 00:27:26.990
"Why don't we do the same
thing?"

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:28.578
They put him up against the
wall and shot him.

00:27:28.578 --> 00:27:31.792
There were these rumors that
were very persistent during the

00:27:31.792 --> 00:27:34.788
whole fighting on the western
front that underneath,

00:27:34.788 --> 00:27:38.579
underneath Reims--where,
after all,

00:27:38.579 --> 00:27:42.108
were all these champagne caves,
or underneath Albers.

00:27:42.108 --> 00:27:45.816
That was the town where the
statue of the Virgin Mary on the

00:27:45.816 --> 00:27:47.890
top of a church hung like this.
 

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:50.788
The Germans said if it falls
one way we're going to win.

00:27:50.788 --> 00:27:52.440
If it falls the other way,
the French are going to win.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.915
That somewhere the people who
are lucky enough to be alive

00:27:56.915 --> 00:27:58.328
were down there.
 

00:27:58.328 --> 00:28:02.955
They would come out and take
food, and they would take wine

00:28:02.955 --> 00:28:05.430
rations, and stuff like that.
 

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:10.880
They would take them back from
the dead, and they were all

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.079
partying underground.
 

00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:15.460
They were the lucky ones.
 

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.819
They were all fraternizing.
 

00:28:16.819 --> 00:28:18.380
It wasn't that case.
 

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:21.098
Still, you hear all these
stories.

00:28:21.098 --> 00:28:23.519
The great war poets sort of
saying, "Yeah,

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:28.029
this German guy and a British
guy find themselves in a crater,

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:31.932
both on the verge of death,
and they're discussing

00:28:31.932 --> 00:28:35.980
Nietzsche until somebody finally
comes and rescues them."

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.598
A lot of this may be apocryphal.
 

00:28:37.598 --> 00:28:42.548
But the mutinies had to do not
with defeatism;

00:28:42.548 --> 00:28:46.609
it had to do with the sheer
madness of it all.

00:28:46.609 --> 00:28:49.029
It was mad.
 

00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.601
And there are still historians
who are saying,

00:28:50.601 --> 00:28:52.088
"Well,
the creeping barrages,

00:28:52.088 --> 00:28:54.671
if they had made them a little
bit more organized then maybe

00:28:54.671 --> 00:28:56.509
the breakthroughs would have
come."

00:28:56.509 --> 00:29:07.390
They're still defending the
impossible after all of these

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:12.828
years--Something happened.
 

00:29:12.828 --> 00:29:17.789
I want to show you these,
please.

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:18.930
I think I'm turning it off.
 

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.400
Simon, can you--?
 

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:23.799
I am nul.
 

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:30.390
It was very dark at the Battle
of Verdun.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.819
What happens?
 

00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:36.400
Could you do this?
 

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.759
Okay.--These are real ones from
Verdun.

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:47.539
Verdun was 1916.
 

00:29:47.539 --> 00:29:49.009
It begins in February.
 

00:29:49.009 --> 00:29:52.440
It rains all the time in that
part of France.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.700
To explain the mutinies is also
to understand Verdun.

00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.470
This is a reconnaissance plane.
 

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.079
Those are craters there.
 

00:30:07.318 --> 00:30:10.799
Those are some more craters
over there.

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:13.538
That's Fort Douaumont or Vaux.
 

00:30:13.538 --> 00:30:15.182
When you go to them,
and you really should go to

00:30:15.182 --> 00:30:16.440
them, it's a long way from
Verdun.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.980
Verdun is the town that's near
there.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.492
The one I'll never forget is
when you go in and you

00:30:21.492 --> 00:30:24.240
see--after the war,
like as people do in churches,

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.278
people would come and put
plaques--the most moving one is

00:30:26.278 --> 00:30:28.650
"To my son,
since his eyes closed.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.720
Mine have not ceased to
cry."

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.559
Next one, please.
 

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:33.529
So, you'd be going in there.
 

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.450
Those are where the plaques
are, right there.

00:30:43.818 --> 00:30:47.220
In fact, that plaque that I
just said is right next to that.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:55.727
Now, you're here and they say,
"Over the top,

00:30:55.727 --> 00:30:56.779
men."
 

00:30:56.779 --> 00:31:01.690
You're trying to get on the
other side there.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.038
How are you going to do that?
 

00:31:03.038 --> 00:31:07.299
That's all barbed wire around
there.

00:31:07.299 --> 00:31:08.210
How are you going to do that?
 

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.630
You can't.
 

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.789
That's inside Vaux or Douaumont.
 

00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:19.670
Night patrol.
 

00:31:19.670 --> 00:31:22.289
Again, there's the trench.
 

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:24.670
They're attacking.
 

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:27.663
But you've got to climb over
your own barbed wire,

00:31:27.663 --> 00:31:28.028
too.
 

00:31:28.028 --> 00:31:30.161
That's barbed wire that's
protecting you from if they

00:31:30.161 --> 00:31:30.529
attack.
 

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:41.674
The casualty rates are just
absolutely phenomenal at all

00:31:41.674 --> 00:31:42.058
these.
 

00:31:42.058 --> 00:31:44.744
The casualty rates here are not
the same as the Somme,

00:31:44.744 --> 00:31:46.618
because it wasn't a massive
attack.

00:31:46.618 --> 00:31:48.358
You're defending it against the
Germans.

00:31:48.358 --> 00:31:52.796
They're taking care of some
people that have been hurt,

00:31:52.796 --> 00:31:54.848
carrying somebody back.
 

00:31:54.848 --> 00:31:58.039
The poor guy looks a little
peaked there.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:01.160
Telephones.
 

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:05.396
The Russian phone system was so
bad the Germans could hear every

00:32:05.396 --> 00:32:08.759
single word that they said on
the eastern front.

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:10.230
Next, please.
 

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.200
Well, you get the point.
 

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.269
There's the machine guns aimed
low--medical.

00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:19.430
That's fantastic to walk in
there.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:22.942
But you have to remember that a
lot of the fighting is on the

00:32:22.942 --> 00:32:24.933
outside in the mists,
and the snow,

00:32:24.933 --> 00:32:25.930
and the crap.
 

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:27.650
It's an amazing thing.
 

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:28.569
But they held.
 

00:32:28.569 --> 00:32:29.900
They held.
 

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.410
Marshall Pétain became
the hero of France.

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:36.549
He would have a later
incarnation in World War II.

00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:37.839
We'll get back to him.
 

00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:39.558
They hold.
 

00:32:39.558 --> 00:32:46.809
How are you going to run up
that hill carrying sixty pounds?

00:32:46.809 --> 00:32:49.538
There's a commune, by the way,
called Douaumont,

00:32:49.538 --> 00:32:53.300
which is the only commune out
of the 36,000 that no longer

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.260
exist because it was so battered
that there's a difference in

00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:00.430
height in these hills of fifty
and 100 feet.

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.500
It could never be rebuilt.
 

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.690
Next, please.
 

00:33:04.690 --> 00:33:07.130
We get the scene.
 

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:13.160
It's amazing how little people
knew.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.690
What they knew on the home
front,

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:17.684
and there's a very good book
edited by Jay Winter and his

00:33:17.684 --> 00:33:19.528
friend,
Jean-Louis Robert,

00:33:19.528 --> 00:33:22.439
about capital cities at war,
about London,

00:33:22.439 --> 00:33:25.190
Paris, and Berlin,
comparing the home front.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.521
It's really good stuff,
how little people knew about

00:33:28.521 --> 00:33:28.980
this.
 

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:33.824
It's like an Italian said,
"Do people really imagine

00:33:33.824 --> 00:33:36.509
that we just jump up and down
screaming â€˜Long Live

00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:37.288
Italy'?"
 

00:33:37.288 --> 00:33:42.282
One of the most amazing things
is that people in the hell,

00:33:42.282 --> 00:33:46.048
actually that more of them
didn't mutiny.

00:33:46.048 --> 00:33:49.700
That's one of the most
incredible things about the

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.190
whole bloody mess.
 

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:56.798
They died in hell,
they called it Passchendaele.

00:33:56.798 --> 00:34:01.615
That was a place where the
British gained four miles,

00:34:01.615 --> 00:34:07.265
that's about seven kilometers,
in exchange for 300,000 dead or

00:34:07.265 --> 00:34:09.210
wounded, 300,000.
 

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.967
Take a football stadium like
University of Michigan or UT

00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:14.871
Austin and fill it up three
times, and imagine that you know

00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:15.710
those people.
 

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:18.050
That's what it was like.
 

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:24.920
1917 changes everything.
 

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.043
1917 changes everything because
two key events happen,

00:34:30.043 --> 00:34:32.170
and they're obvious.
 

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.449
One is the Russian Revolution
in 1917 in February.

00:34:35.449 --> 00:34:38.510
That's A.
 

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:42.570
Then B, and this is still point
number one, is the Russian

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.280
Revolution in October.
 

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.960
It's clear that the--we'll talk
about this or you can read about

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.480
this.
 

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.672
The Kerensky provisional
government is under tremendous

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.539
pressure from the allies to stay
in the war.

00:34:53.539 --> 00:34:57.005
But it is clear that when the
Bolsheviks seize power in

00:34:57.005 --> 00:34:59.699
October 1917,
the Russians are going to get

00:34:59.699 --> 00:35:00.920
out of the war.
 

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.483
"Peace,
land, and bread"

00:35:03.483 --> 00:35:06.980
is a powerful,
powerful slogan for the Russian

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:07.989
soldiers.
 

00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:11.898
It's amazing that the Russian
soldiers didn't all go

00:35:11.898 --> 00:35:14.391
back to Vladivostok,
or to Kazakhstan,

00:35:14.391 --> 00:35:17.534
or to wherever,
that they were able to hold on

00:35:17.534 --> 00:35:18.789
as long as they did.
 

00:35:18.789 --> 00:35:20.920
That's going to change things.
 

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.280
It's at that time that the
second event happens.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.840
That is the Americans come into
the war.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.170
The Americans--outside of
places like Chicago,

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.210
and Milwaukee,
and Philadelphia maybe,

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:36.820
they had lots of Germans--most
people in the United States,

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:39.940
the tendency was to want the
allies to win,

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:45.056
to fight another day,
and the Americans were angered

00:35:45.056 --> 00:35:47.610
by the submarine warfare
campaign.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.630
In 1915, a boat called the
Lusitania was sunk.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.429
There had been warnings posted
by the German government,

00:35:53.429 --> 00:35:56.280
saying, "If you're a
passenger, don't go on that.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.650
You're going into a war
zone."

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.766
The Germans claim when the boat
was sunk that it was full of

00:36:00.766 --> 00:36:01.400
munitions.
 

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.152
The Americans and the British
said, "No,

00:36:03.152 --> 00:36:03.869
it wasn't."
 

00:36:03.869 --> 00:36:05.119
In fact, it was.
 

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:07.949
That was proved about
twenty-years-ago by divers.

00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:10.599
It sunk near Ireland and lots
of people died.

00:36:10.599 --> 00:36:16.010
The Germans know that the only
way they can win the war is the

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:20.978
unrestricted campaign of
submarine warfare to try to keep

00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:25.679
Britain from being supplied by
American supplies.

00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:29.525
Woodrow Wilson,
Princeton, who won the

00:36:29.525 --> 00:36:32.750
election, kept us out of war.
 

00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:36.797
He takes the country into war,
and eventually he can't get the

00:36:36.797 --> 00:36:40.780
Treaty of Versailles passed even
by the American isolationist

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.510
senate.
 

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:44.480
So, the Americans go to war in
1917.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.380
I took Yale alumni,
besides taking them to the

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:48.639
Épernay to drink
champagne,

00:36:48.639 --> 00:36:50.909
a lot of them wanted to go to
this a long time ago,

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:53.532
to Chateau Thierry,
which is the first place that

00:36:53.532 --> 00:36:55.320
American soldiers fought in
1917.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.360
Now, it wasn't the American
troops that made the difference.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.280
In the imaginary,
the imaginaire,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.510
in the perceptions of the
French,

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:07.179
it was the arrival of General
Pershing,

00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:12.130
who had made his career
slaughtering Mexicans in Mexico.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:17.092
The image was that the far west
was coming and these sort of

00:37:17.092 --> 00:37:21.969
gun-toting Dodge City types were
going to turn the tide.

00:37:21.969 --> 00:37:22.989
That's not what happens.
 

00:37:22.989 --> 00:37:25.759
What turns the tide is that
once the Americans are in the

00:37:25.759 --> 00:37:28.380
war, the tremendous industrial
strength of the U.S.

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.730
means the curves are going to
cross.

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:34.657
By that simply I mean the
curves that the Germans know

00:37:34.657 --> 00:37:36.590
they aren't going to win the
war.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.193
The British,
and the French,

00:37:39.193 --> 00:37:44.788
and the American high command
know they're going to win the

00:37:44.788 --> 00:37:45.559
war.
 

00:37:45.559 --> 00:37:49.646
They think they're going to win
the war in 1920 or 1921,

00:37:49.646 --> 00:37:51.949
maybe 1919, if all goes well.
 

00:37:51.949 --> 00:37:54.996
There was a quote in there
after they just had--at the cost

00:37:54.996 --> 00:37:57.780
of thousands of lives--I think
it's still in there.

00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:01.391
They had gotten a couple of
kilometers of territory back

00:38:01.391 --> 00:38:02.639
from the Germans.
 

00:38:02.639 --> 00:38:04.637
Somebody says,
"At this rate,

00:38:04.637 --> 00:38:07.362
we'll get to the Rhine in the
year 2006,"

00:38:07.362 --> 00:38:09.360
I think is what they figured.
 

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.858
The long duration,
of being in until the end,

00:38:12.858 --> 00:38:17.550
was going to be a long time,
if you were able to survive.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.869
Those are the two big events,
the curves cross.

00:38:19.869 --> 00:38:23.016
1917 is also an important year
because tanks begin to make a

00:38:23.016 --> 00:38:23.710
difference.
 

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.880
Tanks can't do anything in
these craters.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.789
They get stuck.
 

00:38:26.789 --> 00:38:30.677
Their treads just sort of spin
like a car stuck in the snow in

00:38:30.677 --> 00:38:32.400
North Haven or something.
 

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.806
They don't make any difference
until actually they can break

00:38:35.806 --> 00:38:36.730
into the open.
 

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:38.561
At that point,
then they can be a way of

00:38:38.561 --> 00:38:40.159
protecting infantry behind them.
 

00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:43.420
So, 1917 really turns it around.
 

00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:46.108
To make a long story short yet
again, in 1918,

00:38:46.108 --> 00:38:48.380
by this time,
Hindenburg and Ludendorff

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.070
basically have taken over the
government.

00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:58.420
Basically, the Second Reich is
now controlled by the military.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.913
Of course, Hindenburg has a
rather pernicious role in the

00:39:00.913 --> 00:39:01.760
long run to play.
 

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.940
He was determined to destroy
the Weimar Republic,

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.349
even though he was president.
 

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:07.929
As he in 1932 says,
"We'll bring in the Adolf.

00:39:07.929 --> 00:39:09.849
We'll bring him in as
chancellor."

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:13.742
So, Ludendorff said,
"Look, we've got to do it

00:39:13.742 --> 00:39:14.210
now.
 

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:15.440
If we don't do it now,
it's never going to

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:15.889
happen."
 

00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:19.688
So, they throw every
conceivable resource into this

00:39:19.688 --> 00:39:20.599
offensive.
 

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:22.489
They do break through.
 

00:39:22.489 --> 00:39:24.230
They do break through.
 

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.630
You can look at the maps in the
book.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.199
They get a long way.
 

00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:30.010
But then it snaps back like a
rubber band.

00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:35.103
They overrun their supplies,
as they had in 1914,

00:39:35.103 --> 00:39:38.820
in the big war offensive in
1914.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:40.480
They begin to overrun their
supplies.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.559
They get tired and then they're
pushed back.

00:39:43.559 --> 00:39:46.364
At that point,
the worst days of the

00:39:46.364 --> 00:39:49.090
bombardment of Paris have ended.
 

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:53.090
The allies are sure they're
going to win the war,

00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:56.420
and that the Germans and the
Austro-Hungarian Empire,

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.719
which is almost on the verge of
collapse,

00:39:58.719 --> 00:40:03.139
despite the sheer inefficiency
of the Italian military,

00:40:03.139 --> 00:40:06.327
they know that it's going to
collapse and that Russia's

00:40:06.327 --> 00:40:09.809
coming out of the war in the
long run did not make that much

00:40:09.809 --> 00:40:10.989
of a difference.
 

00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:14.161
The Italians are able to
stabilize the front in

00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:17.402
Austria-Hungary,
and the whole thing is going to

00:40:17.402 --> 00:40:18.300
collapse.
 

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:20.184
And the Austrian-Hungarian
Empire, the nationalities are

00:40:20.184 --> 00:40:21.179
putting forth their claims.
 

00:40:21.179 --> 00:40:26.242
Franz Joseph dies in 1916,
and it's not going to go on

00:40:26.242 --> 00:40:27.389
that long.
 

00:40:27.389 --> 00:40:31.880
Finally, on the 11^(th) of
November 1918,

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.880
in a railroad car near
Compiegne in the forest,

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.168
not very far north of Paris,
they sign on the dotted line

00:40:41.168 --> 00:40:44.099
and the armistice is declared.
 

00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:48.440
In 1940, Hitler would accept
France's surrender.

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.766
It wasn't actually the same
railroad car,

00:40:52.766 --> 00:40:57.960
but they told him it was,
also in the forest near

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.340
Compiegne in 1940.
 

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:03.320
The war ended.
 

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.420
More about this later.
 

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:16.717
Basically, France in victory is
not as strong as Germany in

00:41:16.717 --> 00:41:17.518
defeat.
 

00:41:17.518 --> 00:41:23.650
Germany is industrially a much
more prosperous country.

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:28.730
This will hang over the
negotiations at Versailles,

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.199
because the French demand that
somebody pay for the war,

00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:36.351
which France suffered more than
any other country in terms of

00:41:36.351 --> 00:41:39.190
its agricultural land being
chewed up,

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.900
the finest land in France,
etc., etc.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.219
That's going to hang over the
peace proceedings.

00:41:46.219 --> 00:41:49.862
I want to make just a few
comments before I end with Jay

00:41:49.862 --> 00:41:50.460
Winter.
 

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.130
We have five minutes left,
so I'm going to do that.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:56.400
The highest percentage of
losses was France,

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.969
with 16.8 percent of those
mobilized killed.

00:42:00.969 --> 00:42:05.090
In Germany, 15.4 percent killed.
 

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.847
But if you take those in
combat, it's twenty-two percent

00:42:08.847 --> 00:42:11.650
officers and eighteen percent
soldiers.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.456
Remember, officers weren't all
fancy generals who were sitting

00:42:14.456 --> 00:42:16.527
drinking champagne,
plotting the deaths of all

00:42:16.527 --> 00:42:17.309
these people.
 

00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:20.742
The junior officers,
and this is also the case in

00:42:20.742 --> 00:42:23.610
the British sense,
the flower of British youth

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.530
from Oxford, Cambridge,
etc., etc.,

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:26.869
they're the ones that blew the
whistle and said,

00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:28.039
"Follow me, men."
 

00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:29.739
And they jump over,
armed with only a pistol.

00:42:29.739 --> 00:42:31.369
They're toast.
 

00:42:31.369 --> 00:42:34.750
They get killed in even greater
percentages.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.458
Anyway, Serbia loses
thirty-seven percent of all its

00:42:37.458 --> 00:42:38.150
combatants.
 

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.590
They don't have as many.
 

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.710
Turkey, twenty-seven percent;
Romania, twenty-five percent;

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.369
and Bulgaria,
twenty-two percent.

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:46.539
Now, think of this.
 

00:42:46.539 --> 00:42:50.436
The war starts in early August,
1914, and it ends on the

00:42:50.436 --> 00:42:52.420
11^(th) of November,
1918.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:58.110
Every day of those years,
every day.

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:02.206
Think four years back in your
own lives, and then every day,

00:43:02.206 --> 00:43:05.610
900 Frenchmen were killed every
day, every day.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:06.920
That's a lot of telegrams.
 

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.150
"Be proud of X."
 

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:11.268
1,300 Germans were killed every
day.

00:43:11.268 --> 00:43:15.110
The death rate was higher in
World War II.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.925
Of course, in World War II,
the Soviet Union has an

00:43:17.925 --> 00:43:21.179
unbelievable death rate,
twenty-five million people die,

00:43:21.179 --> 00:43:24.166
some of them in Stalin's Gulag,
but most of them because of the

00:43:24.166 --> 00:43:24.380
war.
 

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:26.460
The death rate is higher.
 

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.032
July 1,1916,
the first day of the Battle of

00:43:30.032 --> 00:43:34.199
the Somme, 20,000 British
soldiers were killed.

00:43:34.199 --> 00:43:38.389
Not just killed and wounded,
dead in one day.

00:43:38.389 --> 00:43:43.030
They were there to go over the
top, and they're dead at the

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.510
end.
 

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:47.594
Unlike previous wars,
disease didn't play a major

00:43:47.594 --> 00:43:48.190
part.
 

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.699
Unlike, for example,
the Crimean War.

00:43:50.699 --> 00:43:54.570
Though the Blue Flu,
sometimes called the Spanish

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:58.681
Flu, as you know will kill more
people in 1918,1919,

00:43:58.681 --> 00:44:00.860
and 1920, than the war.
 

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.820
That's the pandemic.
 

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:08.708
As I said, most people die of
shells, followed by machine guns

00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:12.860
and flames, despite progress in
medicine.

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.786
Also, things like shell shock
were first identified at this

00:44:16.786 --> 00:44:18.210
time after the war.
 

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:20.929
Freud was very interested in
that, among other people.

00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:23.809
The psychological--I
wasn't--you went into the Paris

00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:27.425
Metro or the London Tube and you
saw people begging with one arm,

00:44:27.425 --> 00:44:28.949
or one leg, or no legs.
 

00:44:28.949 --> 00:44:32.878
You saw people who had also
choked out their lungs on gas or

00:44:32.878 --> 00:44:34.010
who were blind.
 

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:35.750
They were all over the place.
 

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:39.166
Europe was a country of widows,
especially in countries like

00:44:39.166 --> 00:44:42.119
Italy where widows still wore
black all the time.

00:44:42.119 --> 00:44:43.909
Europe was a country of widows.
 

00:44:43.909 --> 00:44:47.050
If you had a demographic curve,
a triangle,

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:51.498
it was like a shark had eaten a
huge bite out of the male

00:44:51.498 --> 00:44:55.550
population between eighteen and,
say, fifty-five.

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.050
The length was simply
staggering.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:01.500
The Battle of the Somme lasted
five months.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.480
Gallipoli lasted more than
eight months.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.570
Verdun, ten months.
 

00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:08.518
Ypres, in 1917, four months.
 

00:45:08.518 --> 00:45:11.141
On the Battle of the Somme,
you talk about how war

00:45:11.141 --> 00:45:14.081
influenced people's lives,
four million men participated

00:45:14.081 --> 00:45:16.489
in the Battle of the Somme,
four million.

00:45:16.489 --> 00:45:18.559
That's a phenomenal statistic.
 

00:45:18.559 --> 00:45:21.704
More than a quarter were
killed, captured,

00:45:21.704 --> 00:45:24.005
or porté
disparu,

00:45:24.005 --> 00:45:27.380
classified as disappeared,
nothing left.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:30.829
Battlefields were no longer
called the field of glory.

00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:32.349
That went.
 

00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:33.400
The language went.
 

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.219
I make an allusion to that,
which is an obvious one,

00:45:35.219 --> 00:45:36.289
at the end of what you read.
 

00:45:36.289 --> 00:45:40.429
Also, there's a brutalization
of the sense of humanity that

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:44.498
you lost because you were
dealing with so many people dead

00:45:44.498 --> 00:45:45.570
all around.
 

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.199
You were fighting for your life.
 

00:45:47.199 --> 00:45:52.260
The attitude that people had
toward other people changes,

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:56.159
and the demons of the twentieth
century--fascism above

00:45:56.159 --> 00:45:59.469
all--would be built on that
dehumanization.

00:45:59.469 --> 00:46:02.588
Difficult to imagine,
though not impossible,

00:46:02.588 --> 00:46:05.199
the Holocaust without World War
I;

00:46:05.199 --> 00:46:08.706
but given the Turks and what
they did to the Armenians,

00:46:08.706 --> 00:46:09.940
it's hard to say.
 

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:11.190
Also, atrocities.
 

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:12.260
There were atrocities.
 

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.760
Now there are a couple of good
books on atrocities.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.425
Most of the atrocities were
committed by the Germans in

00:46:16.425 --> 00:46:16.920
Belgium.
 

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:21.369
They executed 5,500 Belgian
civilians.

00:46:21.369 --> 00:46:24.579
Edith Cavell was the most
famous, the nurse.

00:46:24.579 --> 00:46:29.255
In part because German soldiers
believed that they were being

00:46:29.255 --> 00:46:33.697
picked off by civilians--is what
had happened in France in

00:46:33.697 --> 00:46:34.789
1870-1871.
 

00:46:34.789 --> 00:46:38.572
But the Russians committed
atrocities in east Prussia and

00:46:38.572 --> 00:46:39.449
in Galicia.
 

00:46:39.449 --> 00:46:41.902
The Austrians,
who had been told that the

00:46:41.902 --> 00:46:44.969
Serbs were subhuman,
committed atrocities there.

00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:46.230
There were rapes.
 

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:50.963
Rape had not yet become an arm
of combat as it would with the

00:46:50.963 --> 00:46:55.382
Russians after World War II,
but people were treated like

00:46:55.382 --> 00:46:56.329
animals.
 

00:46:56.329 --> 00:46:58.503
Hitler said in 1939,
"After all,

00:46:58.503 --> 00:47:00.920
who will remember the
Armenians?"

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:03.190
That's an incredible,
chilling thing.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:10.108
So, I want to end simply with
Jay Winter, whom you're going to

00:47:10.108 --> 00:47:14.420
meet soon, assuming I can find
this.

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.900
It's about a haunting film done
by Abel Gance.

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:21.190
It's called J'Accuse,
I Accuse.

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:23.650
It's not the same thing as
Zola's I Accuse;

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:24.750
it's another one.
 

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:26.768
Made in 1918-1919.
 

00:47:26.768 --> 00:47:30.269
The hero, Jean Diaz,
is a wounded soldier poet.

00:47:30.269 --> 00:47:32.018
He begins to lose his mind.
 

00:47:32.018 --> 00:47:35.869
He escapes from the hospital
and he reaches his village.

00:47:35.869 --> 00:47:39.489
There he summons the villagers
and he tells them of a dream.

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:42.713
It starts on a battlefield
graveyard with wooden crosses

00:47:42.713 --> 00:47:44.940
all here, and there,
and everywhere.

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.065
A huge black cloud rises above
it, and magically,

00:47:48.065 --> 00:47:50.929
ghost-like figures emerge from
the ground.

00:47:50.929 --> 00:47:54.291
They're wrapped in tattered
bandages, some limping,

00:47:54.291 --> 00:47:57.987
some blind, walking with
upraised arms stumbling blindly

00:47:57.987 --> 00:48:00.139
like Frankenstein's monster.
 

00:48:00.139 --> 00:48:02.590
They leave the battlefield and
they go home.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.960
They go from the grave to their
villages.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:09.030
And they want to see if their
sacrifices have been in vain.

00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:11.293
And they get back to their
villages and what they find is

00:48:11.293 --> 00:48:12.909
that their wives have cheated on
them.

00:48:12.909 --> 00:48:16.248
They find that people are still
ripping people off by false

00:48:16.248 --> 00:48:17.630
weights at the market.
 

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:22.280
The petty ways have continued
despite their horrific losses.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:25.969
They say, "You must mend
your ways.

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.893
We didn't go through all of
this hell so that you would

00:48:28.893 --> 00:48:30.679
continue to behave like you do.
 

00:48:30.679 --> 00:48:32.840
The world, after all,
must be a better place.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:34.130
Isn't it a better place now?
 

00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:35.099
Won't it be?"
 

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:38.081
That's the big illusion,
by the way, about 1920s and

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:38.550
1930s.
 

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:40.360
The world wasn't going to be a
better place.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.539
It wasn't at all.
 

00:48:42.539 --> 00:48:45.880
They believed their mission is
fulfilled.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.719
They go back to their graves.
 

00:48:47.719 --> 00:48:52.027
After recounting this dream,
the poet, now totally mad,

00:48:52.027 --> 00:48:56.253
accuses the sun above of
standing idly by and watching

00:48:56.253 --> 00:48:57.690
the war go on.
 

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.659
Then he dies.
 

00:48:59.659 --> 00:49:03.724
The oddest thing about this,
about how art and reality

00:49:03.724 --> 00:49:08.480
merge, is that this film was
made before the end of the war.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.574
I'll bet Gance,
the producer,

00:49:10.574 --> 00:49:15.211
got permission from the army to
have real soldiers be extras in

00:49:15.211 --> 00:49:16.260
his movie.
 

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:19.141
You can see real people,
who are not going back to the

00:49:19.141 --> 00:49:21.099
front, with their arms ripped
off.

00:49:21.099 --> 00:49:23.360
Stumps.
 

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.610
They had stumps.
 

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:27.501
Some of the people who were in
that movie went back to the

00:49:27.501 --> 00:49:28.719
front and were killed.
 

00:49:28.719 --> 00:49:31.889
They didn't survive the war.
 

00:49:31.889 --> 00:49:36.664
The war had taken a terrible
vengeance both in art,

00:49:36.664 --> 00:49:41.726
the joys of great artistic
production, but on reality,

00:49:41.726 --> 00:49:42.489
too.
 

00:49:42.489 --> 00:49:44.260
It's an incredible scene.
 

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.150
Of course, things couldn't go
back again.

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:48.369
You couldn't go back to your
village.

00:49:48.369 --> 00:49:50.110
You couldn't get off a bus at
the end,

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:54.300
and go back and fall into the
arms of your family,

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:57.572
and stand there with tears on
your cheeks as you were counting

00:49:57.572 --> 00:50:00.130
off the names of the dead,
people that you knew.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.880
Things were going to get
better, but they don't.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.519
One way of looking at the
entire period of 1914 to 1945,

00:50:07.519 --> 00:50:11.268
and Jay will talk about this,
is to view it as an entire,

00:50:11.268 --> 00:50:14.110
more horrible Thirty Years'
War,

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:16.695
because things don't get better;
they get worse,

00:50:16.695 --> 00:50:18.389
if that's even possible.
 

00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:21.522
On that light note,
I wish you a happy election.

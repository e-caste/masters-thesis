00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:07.909
Professor Robert
Shiller: Today I want to

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:13.787
talk about options.
I should just say what an

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:15.980
option is.
I'll write the word.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.486
It's a contract that has an
owner and the owner of the

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:35.362
option contract has rights to
find in the contract either to

00:00:35.362 --> 00:00:41.771
buy or sell some thing--let's
say a share of stock--at a

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:46.550
specified price and specified
date.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.360
There are two kinds;
there's a put and a call.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.009
A put option is the right to
sell.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.766
It's typically a hundred
shares, so we'll say a hundred

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:12.010
shares of a company;
let's say it's Google.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.904
The option would have--if it
was a put option and there was a

00:01:16.904 --> 00:01:21.310
price, then you would have the
right up--let me see,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:31.412
there's the exercise price,
also known as the strike,

00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:37.630
and there's the exercise date.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:53.940
I should also emphasize that
there are two kinds of options.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.782
There are American,
so called, and European,

00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:05.250
so called.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.253
It has nothing to with whether
they are in America or Europe

00:02:13.253 --> 00:02:17.066
because in Europe they trade
both American options and

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:21.597
European options and in America
they trade both American options

00:02:21.597 --> 00:02:25.658
and European options;
so, it's very unfortunate

00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:29.177
terminology.
The American--what this

00:02:29.177 --> 00:02:35.799
means--an American option means
the right to exercise the option

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.370
on any date until and including
the exercise date;

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:50.910
with European,
it's only on exercise date.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.811
That's what those words mean.
So, usually we're talking about

00:02:56.811 --> 00:03:01.828
American options.
If you have an American

00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:09.409
option--American put option--on
shares of some stock,

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.421
then you have the right anytime
you feel like it,

00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:19.641
until the exercise date,
to sell that option at the

00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:25.450
price specified in the contract,
called the exercise price.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.393
If it's European,
you have to wait until the

00:03:32.393 --> 00:03:37.349
exercise date and then you have
one day when you can do that.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:44.451
A call option is the right to
buy a share of stock or whatever

00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:49.690
it is--whatever is specified in
the option.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.009
In a traditional option,
there are two parties;

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:01.776
there's the buy of the option
and usually we present them from

00:04:01.776 --> 00:04:06.030
the perspective of the buyer of
the option.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.641
The buyer of the option pays a
price to buy the option--not to

00:04:10.641 --> 00:04:14.270
be confused with the exercise
price--and then,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.157
depending on whether it's
American or European,

00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:26.939
has until the exercise date to
exercise the option;

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.000
but, the buyer doesn't have to
do anything.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.177
You can just do nothing;
you can buy the option and if

00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:35.793
you do nothing it becomes
worthless because the only way

00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:39.542
the option ever gives you value
after you buy it is if you

00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:42.136
exercise it,
meaning you say,

00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:45.459
I will use my right to buy or
sell.

00:04:45.459 --> 00:04:53.370
The other party is the writer
of the option.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.854
Because it's a contract,
it has to be between two

00:04:56.854 --> 00:05:00.894
parties.
Somebody is on the other side

00:05:00.894 --> 00:05:10.572
and you can do either one;
you can either buy or write an

00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:16.980
option.
If you--let me make this clear;

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.973
if you write a call option,
then what you are committing

00:05:22.973 --> 00:05:28.421
yourself to do as the
writer--you sign the contract

00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:33.660
from the writer's contract,
which goes along with the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.263
buyer's contract.
Well, it provides rights to the

00:05:38.263 --> 00:05:41.171
buyer.
If you write a call option,

00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:45.513
then you--and say it's
American--then you are signing a

00:05:45.513 --> 00:05:50.097
contract --let's say it's on
stock--to deliver one hundred

00:05:50.097 --> 00:05:55.874
shares to the other guy,
the buyer, whenever that guy

00:05:55.874 --> 00:05:59.424
feels like it.
That guy will pay you the

00:05:59.424 --> 00:06:02.493
contracted price,
so it's not--it doesn't seem

00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:06.039
like much fun to be a writer of
an option because you

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.335
have--you're just sitting there
waiting for this other person to

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:15.830
make up his or her mind.
There's a benefit;

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.271
mainly, you get the money.
The buyer of the option pays

00:06:21.271 --> 00:06:26.684
you up front for providing this
right to the buyer,

00:06:26.684 --> 00:06:32.639
so writers of options write
them hoping that they expire

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.470
unexercised;
that's when they make money.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.574
If you write an option and the
buyer of the option pays you the

00:06:40.574 --> 00:06:44.680
money up front and then you
never hear from the buyer again,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.360
then you're--that's the way you
like it.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:56.044
So, you make money by writing
options and hoping that they

00:06:56.044 --> 00:07:02.100
don't get exercised.
Of course, you can write a put

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:07.250
option and that means--if you
write a put option,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.114
you are signing a contract that
says that whenever this other

00:07:12.114 --> 00:07:16.446
guy on the other side,
the buyer, decides to,

00:07:16.446 --> 00:07:22.413
that guy will sell you a
hundred shares at the specified

00:07:22.413 --> 00:07:27.012
price.
Again, you're laying yourself

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:34.382
open to, whenever this guy wants
to, you've got to receive a

00:07:34.382 --> 00:07:38.879
hundred shares and pay the
money.

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:44.201
Now, these kinds of contracts
are very old and,

00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:50.680
in fact, we had a conference
over the weekend at the Yale

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:57.736
School of Management on--it was
a very interesting--I've never

00:07:57.736 --> 00:08:02.480
experienced anything quite like
it.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.160
Maybe I should put the website
up for you to look at.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:13.811
There's a book;
it's called The Great Mirror

00:08:13.811 --> 00:08:20.016
of Folly,
written in 1720 about the stock

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:28.759
market and the Beinecke Rare
Book Library has a copy of it.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:36.610
They're very rare--about the
stock market crash of 1720.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.413
Did you know that there was a
big stock market crash in the

00:08:40.413 --> 00:08:44.276
year 1720?
What was happening in New Haven

00:08:44.276 --> 00:08:47.505
in 1720?
Well, I know one thing that was

00:08:47.505 --> 00:08:50.970
happening in 1720 in New
Haven--I'm guessing;

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.035
I'm pretty sure.
You had some pretty angry

00:08:54.035 --> 00:08:57.319
investors who lost everything in
the stock market,

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:59.531
but it couldn't have been the
U.S.

00:08:59.531 --> 00:09:02.480
stock market,
which wasn't created yet.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:12.628
The crash of 1720 was primarily
in Paris and London,

00:09:12.628 --> 00:09:19.796
also less so in Amsterdam;
those were the financial

00:09:19.796 --> 00:09:23.252
centers of the world.
So, I'm speculating there must

00:09:23.252 --> 00:09:25.710
have been someone here in New
Haven;

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:31.159
probably Yale University lost
in this crash--I don't know.

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:34.001
There must have been someone
here who lost--it was a huge and

00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:37.680
devastating stock market.
This is the first one actually;

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.241
the first stock market crash.
We had a lot of fun at this

00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:44.629
conference;
it just relates to options.

00:09:44.629 --> 00:09:50.310
I'll tell you why it relates to
options, because people were

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:54.450
writing options galore in 1720
on stocks.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:10:00.294
The book--if you search on
Great Mirror of Folly on

00:10:00.294 --> 00:10:06.549
the Web, it'll come up with our
conference and proceedings.

00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:09.866
Since this book--copyrights
expire after,

00:10:09.866 --> 00:10:14.095
well, it's a complicated
formula, but in less then a

00:10:14.095 --> 00:10:16.456
century.
So, this is all public domain,

00:10:16.456 --> 00:10:19.279
so Yale has it up on the Web
and you can read the whole book.

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:22.030
Unfortunately,
it's written in Dutch,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.690
which might deter some of you,
but it has lots of pictures.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:31.594
We had great--at this
conference, the--it was the most

00:10:31.594 --> 00:10:36.868
interdisciplinary conference
I've ever seen because we had

00:10:36.868 --> 00:10:42.538
professors from the Art History,
Comparative Literature,

00:10:42.538 --> 00:10:46.200
Finance, Economics,
and Psychology.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:51.009
We had scholars from all over
the world who knew about the

00:10:51.009 --> 00:10:55.649
year 1720, including a lot of
Dutchmen who were here.

00:10:55.649 --> 00:11:01.479
Anyway, the highlight of it
was--one highlight for me was,

00:11:01.479 --> 00:11:07.308
it had a--we saw a picture of
an option from this time--an

00:11:07.308 --> 00:11:12.320
option contract to buy stocks
from Amsterdam.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:17.371
It showed it was a printed form;
they had printed forms back

00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:18.559
then, at least in Holland they
did.

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:21.000
So, a printer had printed up
with blanks to fill in.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.391
There's a place to fill in the
exercise price and the exercise

00:11:26.391 --> 00:11:28.252
date.
I don't know whether it was

00:11:28.252 --> 00:11:30.784
American or European at the
time, but I'm sure if it was

00:11:30.784 --> 00:11:33.500
American they didn't call it an
American option in 1720.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:34.610
They didn't even call them
options.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:36.720
Of course, it's all in Dutch,
so I don't know;

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.710
it was some other word--not
options.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.248
I'm just saying this because
the-- The other interesting

00:11:45.248 --> 00:11:49.173
thing about 1720 is that they
didn't make the same distinction

00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:52.389
between investing and gambling
that we do now.

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:58.037
Right now, anyone on Wall
Street is very loathe to have

00:11:58.037 --> 00:12:02.429
any suggestion of connection
with gambling,

00:12:02.429 --> 00:12:07.985
but back then they didn't care.
So, lots of stocks would have

00:12:07.985 --> 00:12:11.842
lotteries attached or there
would be all kinds of--something

00:12:11.842 --> 00:12:14.982
called a tontine,
where a group of investors

00:12:14.982 --> 00:12:19.139
would invest in something and
then all the money would go to

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:22.690
the last one to die,
after all of them died but one.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.215
That's a sort of gambling;
I don't know what sense it

00:12:27.215 --> 00:12:33.563
makes, but they did that.
I remember an old story on--I

00:12:33.563 --> 00:12:39.009
just heard this somewhere--from
the 1920s.

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.592
Two brokers on the New York
Stock Exchange floor were

00:12:41.592 --> 00:12:44.721
talking to each other and one of
them says, "I'll be you $5 that

00:12:44.721 --> 00:12:49.822
the market's going to go up."
Then the senior man scolded him

00:12:49.822 --> 00:12:54.743
and said, "are you betting?
You will be thrown off this

00:12:54.743 --> 00:12:57.799
floor permanently if I hear that
word again."

00:12:57.799 --> 00:13:01.553
So, that attitude has
persisted--that investing should

00:13:01.553 --> 00:13:06.378
be distinguished from gambling.
I suppose there's good reason

00:13:06.378 --> 00:13:11.011
for that because gambling
instincts can take hold of us

00:13:11.011 --> 00:13:14.100
and investing has a good
purpose.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.705
Unfortunately,
our emotions can carry us away

00:13:17.705 --> 00:13:22.129
from the good purpose and
gambling is not investing.

00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:25.406
Back in 1720,
the distinction was not so

00:13:25.406 --> 00:13:30.616
clear and this event was so--it
got--the reason they called the

00:13:30.616 --> 00:13:35.489
book The Great Mirror of
Folly is that the event got

00:13:35.489 --> 00:13:38.672
totally crazy.
People were squandering their

00:13:38.672 --> 00:13:43.320
life fortunes.
I'll tell you one more story.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.002
We had a great time at this
conference because this book,

00:13:46.002 --> 00:13:48.898
Mirror of Folly,
includes plays that were

00:13:48.898 --> 00:13:53.429
written in 1720 and performed in
Amsterdam about the crash--about

00:13:53.429 --> 00:13:57.018
the stock market crash.
The organizers of this

00:13:57.018 --> 00:14:01.787
conference got some students
from Saybrook College to perform

00:14:01.787 --> 00:14:06.080
one of the plays from Great
Mirror of Folly.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.621
Is anyone here from Saybrook?
Okay, you weren't in the--I

00:14:09.621 --> 00:14:14.421
didn't see you there though.
There was a scene in the play

00:14:14.421 --> 00:14:19.652
where the young woman was being
told by her father that he

00:14:19.652 --> 00:14:24.883
intends for her to marry a very
promising young man who is

00:14:24.883 --> 00:14:29.379
speculating in stocks and will
soon be rich.

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:33.030
She is very skeptical about
being forced to marry;

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:38.519
she has somebody else in mind.
The father says that the other

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:42.250
young man is worthless;
he'll never amount to anything.

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.566
But, she stuck by her guns and
insisted that I will never marry

00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:49.629
a man who's in love with the
stock market.

00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:52.993
We don't know what happened
because it's all fictional,

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:55.859
but as we know,
the whole stock market crashed,

00:14:55.859 --> 00:14:58.600
so she was right on two counts
probably.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.250
Anyway, that's all
about--options are very old,

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:08.304
but they've emerged more
recently as very important

00:15:08.304 --> 00:15:11.431
contracts.
In particular,

00:15:11.431 --> 00:15:16.076
what they didn't have in
1720--in fact,

00:15:16.076 --> 00:15:22.678
they didn't have anywhere until
recently--is an options

00:15:22.678 --> 00:15:26.618
exchange.
The problem with a traditional

00:15:26.618 --> 00:15:30.480
option is that it's a contract
between two parties.

00:15:34.009 --> 00:15:36.674
If you write--if you buy an
option, you're at the mercy of

00:15:36.674 --> 00:15:39.831
this other person.
So, if you buy an option that

00:15:39.831 --> 00:15:43.279
was written by a broker,
as they were in 1720,

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:47.340
what if the other guy
doesn't--he just skips town;

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.339
he's gone.
You bought this option to

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:54.534
either buy or sell and then when
the date comes you can't find

00:15:54.534 --> 00:15:56.679
this guy.
So, what do you do?

00:15:56.679 --> 00:16:02.009
You obviously were cheated out
of your money.

00:16:02.009 --> 00:16:08.603
So, we created--that was a
problem until 1973,

00:16:08.603 --> 00:16:14.610
when the first options exchange
opened.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:20.572
Well, I think there may have
been ways of dealing with the

00:16:20.572 --> 00:16:25.323
problem, but not before '73.
But, this is the first options

00:16:25.323 --> 00:16:32.303
exchange--Chicago Board Options
Exchange--which was a spin off

00:16:32.303 --> 00:16:38.274
of the Chicago Board of Trade.
Now, what they did was they

00:16:38.274 --> 00:16:42.990
organized a central marketplace
for standardized options.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.624
Options used to be written for
whatever exercise date anybody

00:16:46.624 --> 00:16:52.259
wanted;
there was no standardization.

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:55.894
An options exchange is like
creating a futures market when

00:16:55.894 --> 00:16:58.700
you only had a forward market in
the past.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:04.391
They started trading options on
U.S.

00:17:04.391 --> 00:17:14.474
stocks in 1973 and they require
that the writer of a naked call

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:21.029
has to put up margin.
What is a naked call?

00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:25.664
If you write a call,
you are standing ready to sell

00:17:25.664 --> 00:17:31.319
a hundred shares to the buyer,
whenever that buyer decides--if

00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:37.749
it's American--to do that.
But you're naked if you don't

00:17:37.749 --> 00:17:42.921
own the hundred shares.
One way you can do it is,

00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:46.535
you can show that you own a
hundred shares,

00:17:46.535 --> 00:17:51.009
so there's no way that you
could fail to deliver.

00:17:51.009 --> 00:17:55.674
If you're naked,
then you are required to put up

00:17:55.674 --> 00:18:01.330
margin and the margin is an
amount that was enough so that

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:06.452
if you fail to deliver,
the CBOE could access your

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:11.808
margin account and buy the
shares on the market to sell to

00:18:11.808 --> 00:18:15.797
the buyer;
there'd be enough money to do

00:18:15.797 --> 00:18:19.323
that.
The margin requirement for the

00:18:19.323 --> 00:18:25.033
writer makes the contract secure
so that there is really no

00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:30.251
counterparty risk with options
purchased on an options

00:18:30.251 --> 00:18:33.498
exchange.
Now, there are many options

00:18:33.498 --> 00:18:37.720
exchanges, but the CBOE--I'm
just listing it--was the first.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:46.780
Now, futures exchanges sell
options on futures;

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.742
that's the same thing as an
option on a stock,

00:18:52.742 --> 00:18:55.586
but instead of a stock
contract, it's a futures

00:18:55.586 --> 00:19:01.141
contract.
That would be done at the CME

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:07.039
Group, which is a futures
exchange.

00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:12.922
That's just--we're just talking
about where you can do these

00:19:12.922 --> 00:19:18.224
things.
Did I explain the concept of

00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:25.318
options?
Maybe I should go through

00:19:25.318 --> 00:19:37.130
the--I have here a plot
illustrating a call option.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:43.006
On the vertical--on the
horizontal axis,

00:19:43.006 --> 00:19:46.170
I have stock price;

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:54.759
that's $0 a share,
$5 a share, $10 a share.

00:19:54.759 --> 00:19:58.440
I'm showing it up to $45 a
share.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:06.100
Now, I'm going to illustrate
the intrinsic value of an option

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.808
with a $20 strike price.
Now, the option would be

00:20:10.808 --> 00:20:14.048
typically for 100 shares,
but I'm going to describe it as

00:20:14.048 --> 00:20:16.420
if it were an option to buy one
share;

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.369
so, it would be 1/100th of a
typical option.

00:20:20.369 --> 00:20:26.558
This broken straight line is
what we call the intrinsic value

00:20:26.558 --> 00:20:30.890
of the option,
which is the money you could

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.809
get if you exercised it right
now.

00:20:34.809 --> 00:20:39.468
If you decided--we'll never
have intrinsic value negative

00:20:39.468 --> 00:20:45.258
because you wouldn't exercise.
So, let me explain what this

00:20:45.258 --> 00:20:48.903
means.
Suppose you own an option with

00:20:48.903 --> 00:20:54.440
an exercise price of $20 and the
price of a share is $15.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.504
What is the value of that
option today--the intrinsic

00:20:58.504 --> 00:21:02.613
value?
Well, it's nothing because the

00:21:02.613 --> 00:21:08.069
option gives me a right to buy a
share at $20,

00:21:08.069 --> 00:21:10.728
but hey, I can buy it under the
stock market for $15,

00:21:10.728 --> 00:21:13.030
so I would never exercise the
option today.

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:16.253
It would be worthless;
it would be worth minus $5 if I

00:21:16.253 --> 00:21:19.566
exercised it today because I
would be paying $20 for

00:21:19.566 --> 00:21:23.147
something I could get for $15,
but I'm not going to call it

00:21:23.147 --> 00:21:25.359
minus 5;
I'm going to call it 0 because

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:29.793
you just--you won't exercise.
If the stock price is below the

00:21:29.793 --> 00:21:32.650
exercised price,
I have a value.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:37.309
On the vertical axis is the
intrinsic of the call;

00:21:37.309 --> 00:21:40.049
I have to distinguish it
between actual value.

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:49.009
This isn't the price that is
quoted for the option;

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:52.778
this is what it would be worth
if you exercised it today if it

00:21:52.778 --> 00:21:55.990
were--the option has value
beyond its intrinsic value

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.769
because even though it's
worthless today,

00:21:58.769 --> 00:22:02.069
it might be worth something in
the future.

00:22:02.069 --> 00:22:05.247
I'll come back to that but this
is just--I'm just talking about

00:22:05.247 --> 00:22:08.458
intrinsic value.
Now, what if the stock price is

00:22:08.458 --> 00:22:11.882
$30 today.
What is the value of the

00:22:11.882 --> 00:22:16.808
option--the intrinsic value?
Well, it's going to be $10,

00:22:16.808 --> 00:22:19.625
obviously, because if you
exercise it today,

00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:23.752
you're buying the stock for $20
and you can sell it today for 30

00:22:23.752 --> 00:22:27.549
on the stock market;
so, the difference is 10.

00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:30.732
This line here--it doesn't look
like a--this is a 45º

00:22:30.732 --> 00:22:33.970
angle here--doesn't look like
it, but that's what it is.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.950
It has a slope of one.
It's very simple;

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.019
the intrinsic value for a call
is just a broken straight line;

00:22:41.019 --> 00:22:43.859
it breaks at the exercised
price.

00:22:43.859 --> 00:22:49.865
To give you a little bit more
jargon, in this region we say

00:22:49.865 --> 00:22:53.490
the option is "out of the
money."

00:22:53.490 --> 00:22:58.319
That means, exercised today,
it would be worthless.

00:22:58.319 --> 00:23:03.869
This one right here is called
"at the money."

00:23:03.869 --> 00:23:08.523
If the stock price is equal to
the exercised price,

00:23:08.523 --> 00:23:13.083
then the stock--we'd call the
option at the money,

00:23:13.083 --> 00:23:17.136
for a call.
Here, if the stock price is

00:23:17.136 --> 00:23:22.450
above the exercise price,
we say it's "in the money."

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.970
This line goes off into
infinity;

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:32.059
I just stopped it there.
That's straightforward, right?

00:23:32.059 --> 00:23:35.097
Anyway, this does illustrate
something about options that is

00:23:35.097 --> 00:23:37.619
different from anything we've
discussed before.

00:23:37.619 --> 00:23:42.019
This is a broken straight line,
not a straight line.

00:23:42.019 --> 00:23:48.773
All of our talk about
portfolios to date has been

00:23:48.773 --> 00:23:51.423
linear.
When you combine stocks,

00:23:51.423 --> 00:23:54.825
you are making your portfolio
respond linearly to the return

00:23:54.825 --> 00:23:57.420
of any one of the stocks in the
portfolio,

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.250
but this is non-linear because
we have a break;

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:10.240
that's what options do,
so it's non-linear finance.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.769
Some people are confused about
what options really are.

00:24:13.769 --> 00:24:17.143
Often people say,
well if I buy a stock option

00:24:17.143 --> 00:24:21.865
that means I can make up my mind
later whether I want to buy and

00:24:21.865 --> 00:24:24.406
sell.
So hey, I'm just getting the

00:24:24.406 --> 00:24:27.805
right to be indecisive or
to--well, think of it this

00:24:27.805 --> 00:24:31.870
way--I haven't made up my mind
whether I really want to invest

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.869
in options or not--in stocks or
not--so,

00:24:34.869 --> 00:24:37.839
I'll buy an option and that
gives me the right to buy.

00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:42.099
You could say that and a lot of
people think that way.

00:24:42.099 --> 00:24:46.765
Like, a company will think,
we're trying to decide whether

00:24:46.765 --> 00:24:50.039
we want to build this shopping
center.

00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:53.344
So, we'll buy an option on the
land underlying where we would

00:24:53.344 --> 00:24:56.539
build the shopping center and
we'll think more about it and

00:24:56.539 --> 00:25:00.009
decide whether it's a good idea
to build a shopping center.

00:25:00.009 --> 00:25:03.553
You could do that,
but there's something a little

00:25:03.553 --> 00:25:07.761
bit misleading about that
reasoning because whether or not

00:25:07.761 --> 00:25:11.009
you decide to build the shopping
center,

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:14.012
if you buy an option on the
land you will always exercise it

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:17.014
if it's in the money on the
exercise date--whether you build

00:25:17.014 --> 00:25:20.332
a shopping center or not.
Suppose you couldn't decide

00:25:20.332 --> 00:25:24.290
whether to build a shopping
center and you bought an option

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:27.430
on land and then someone comes
in and says,

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.230
well we have to make up our
mind today;

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.773
the option is exercising--is
expiring--if we don't exercise

00:25:33.773 --> 00:25:37.130
it today it's worthless.
What do you discuss at your

00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:38.969
meeting?
You don't discuss whether we're

00:25:38.969 --> 00:25:40.910
going to build the shopping
center or not;

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.210
that's irrelevant.
You discuss,

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.750
what can we sell the land for
and if we can sell it for more

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.049
than the exercise price,
we will always exercise it.

00:25:50.049 --> 00:25:56.841
So, there's no--the assumption
in finance is that all options

00:25:56.841 --> 00:26:03.519
that are in the money on the
exercise date are exercised and

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:07.551
there's no choice.
The word option might be

00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:11.020
misleading because--you could
choose to be dumb and not

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:14.039
exercise it, but that's not what
it's about.

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:17.016
On the other hand,
options really are central to

00:26:17.016 --> 00:26:19.359
our thinking about a lot of
things.

00:26:19.359 --> 00:26:22.363
I'll give you an example of an
option that you might not

00:26:22.363 --> 00:26:25.764
consider an option.
This is the option to marry

00:26:25.764 --> 00:26:29.607
somebody.
Sometimes people will complain

00:26:29.607 --> 00:26:34.619
that their boyfriend or
girlfriend cannot commit.

00:26:34.619 --> 00:26:37.859
We've been going out for three
years;

00:26:37.859 --> 00:26:43.627
it's time that we get married,
but this person--the

00:26:43.627 --> 00:26:48.009
counterparty--cannot seem to
decide.

00:26:48.009 --> 00:26:52.021
Actually, one view of it--of
that situation--could be that

00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:55.822
this person is just better
schooled in finance than the

00:26:55.822 --> 00:27:00.185
other because one principle of
finance is that you should never

00:27:00.185 --> 00:27:04.775
exercise an American call early.
I'm not this cynical about

00:27:04.775 --> 00:27:07.775
relationships;
I'm just telling you a story

00:27:07.775 --> 00:27:10.633
that comes to mind.
You'd never want to--I'll come

00:27:10.633 --> 00:27:13.890
back to that--you never want to
exercise an American call early,

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.203
so that's why there isn't an
important distinction between

00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:21.779
European and American.
Just in the case of

00:27:21.779 --> 00:27:25.483
relationships,
suppose your girlfriend or

00:27:25.483 --> 00:27:30.854
boyfriend really wants to marry
you and is still giving you

00:27:30.854 --> 00:27:33.205
time,
then you instinctively know you

00:27:33.205 --> 00:27:35.230
should wait as long--I'm saying
not really,

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:37.849
but I'm saying in terms of
theory;

00:27:37.849 --> 00:27:41.522
you should wait until the last
day when this other person says

00:27:41.522 --> 00:27:44.954
it's now or never because
there's always exercise--there's

00:27:44.954 --> 00:27:48.457
always option value.
There's always a chance--maybe

00:27:48.457 --> 00:27:51.575
that will become clearer.
I don't know if you like my

00:27:51.575 --> 00:27:53.724
analogy.
I'm not cynical about these

00:27:53.724 --> 00:27:56.750
things as some people are.
Peter?

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:02.610
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Robert

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:07.962
Shiller: This is a call
option up here,

00:28:07.962 --> 00:28:12.594
but--this is a call.
I'm going to show you a put--go

00:28:12.594 --> 00:28:14.496
ahead.
What arbitrage--

00:28:14.496 --> 00:28:18.943
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Robert

00:28:18.943 --> 00:28:24.549
Shiller: The price--I'm
going to come back to that.

00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:27.946
The price of the option will
always be above that line,

00:28:27.946 --> 00:28:31.657
so there's no arbi--there are
possible--it depends on if the

00:28:31.657 --> 00:28:34.110
price is wrong--they're
arbitraged.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:38.059
Let me come back to that.
This is a put option.

00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:42.132
This is intrinsic value for a
put option because it's the

00:28:42.132 --> 00:28:46.142
opposite of a call.
If the strike price is $20 and

00:28:46.142 --> 00:28:51.191
the stock price is selling for
$15, then you can see that it's

00:28:51.191 --> 00:28:55.660
in the money because you can
make $5 by exercising.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:59.666
You have the right to sell it
for 20 but you can buy it in the

00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:02.490
market for 15,
so you buy it for 15 and sell

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.480
it for 20;
you make $5.

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.230
On the other hand,
up here--if the stock price is

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:10.810
$30, you have the right to sell
it for $20.

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.341
Well, that's worth nothing;
I can sell it for 30 in the

00:29:14.341 --> 00:29:23.789
market.
Then what--let me jump to this;

00:29:23.789 --> 00:29:27.392
this isn't exactly the order
that I wanted to do it,

00:29:27.392 --> 00:29:31.630
but the--this has to do with
arbitrage as you were saying.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:36.670
The price in the market should
always be greater than the

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:40.630
intrinsic value,
until the exercise date--the

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:45.760
last date for an American--even
American or European,

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:53.225
but let's talk American.
This pink line is my price for

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:57.107
the option;
we'll talk about how we get

00:29:57.107 --> 00:30:00.673
that line from theory,
but price--if the--let's say,

00:30:00.673 --> 00:30:04.170
if it's an American option it's
got time to go.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:09.011
Let's say the exercise date is
not for another year and it's

00:30:09.011 --> 00:30:12.703
out of the money;
the price of a share is only

00:30:12.703 --> 00:30:15.369
$15 but the exercise price is
$20.

00:30:15.369 --> 00:30:17.637
That option is still worth
something today,

00:30:17.637 --> 00:30:19.730
right?
It's not worthless.

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:22.128
It would be worthless if you
exercised it today,

00:30:22.128 --> 00:30:24.630
but hey, you're not going to
exercise it today.

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:29.479
The reason it has value is that
the price might rise above $20

00:30:29.479 --> 00:30:34.091
sometime over the next year and
so it--you have a chance of

00:30:34.091 --> 00:30:38.226
making money on it.
That means the price of the

00:30:38.226 --> 00:30:43.351
option is always going to be
worth more than the price of the

00:30:43.351 --> 00:30:44.748
stock.
No, it's always going to be

00:30:44.748 --> 00:30:45.610
worth more than the intrinsic
value.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.791
What about at the money?
An at-the-money option--if the

00:30:49.791 --> 00:30:53.981
price of a share is 20 and the
option--and the exercise is 20,

00:30:53.981 --> 00:30:56.730
exercise it today and it's
worthless.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:01.070
It has to be valuable because
fifty-fifty chance the stock

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:05.791
price is going to go up and so
you have a good chance of making

00:31:05.791 --> 00:31:09.135
money on it.
So, it's going to be worth a

00:31:09.135 --> 00:31:14.069
lot more than this one was down
here because we're at the money.

00:31:14.069 --> 00:31:18.730
Any little jostle upward is
going to put it in the money.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.726
There's a big chance that this
will become in the money,

00:31:21.726 --> 00:31:24.160
so it has real value;
whereas, down here,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.702
the option doesn't have much
value because it would take a

00:31:27.702 --> 00:31:30.250
big price move to put it in the
money.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:34.716
Then what about up here?
Even when they're in the money

00:31:34.716 --> 00:31:38.430
they're worth more than
intrinsic value.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.529
You kind of wonder,
well why would that be?

00:31:40.529 --> 00:31:48.009
Well, it's because this thing
is better than owning the stock.

00:31:48.009 --> 00:31:51.940
Let's say, at this point,
when the stock price is 25,

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.627
I'd rather own the option than
to own a share minus $20 because

00:31:56.627 --> 00:32:00.710
the option can't fail me as much
as the share can.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.687
The share minus $20 could be
negative in value before the

00:32:04.687 --> 00:32:07.742
exercise date,
but the worst that can happen

00:32:07.742 --> 00:32:11.009
to my option is it would be
worth nothing.

00:32:11.009 --> 00:32:14.094
The arbitrage,
Peter, that you were referring

00:32:14.094 --> 00:32:18.440
to is the arbitrage--what if the
price were below this line?

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.130
Maybe that's what you were
thinking.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:23.723
What if the option price--what
if the stock price is $30 and

00:32:23.723 --> 00:32:27.446
the option is selling at $5?
If it's an American option I

00:32:27.446 --> 00:32:34.255
have an immediate arbitrage.
I buy--if it's a call option I

00:32:34.255 --> 00:32:41.376
would buy the option for $5.
I would exercise it and sell

00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:44.770
for $30 and I'll make money
instantly.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:49.626
That can't happen.
We can't have the option price

00:32:49.626 --> 00:32:56.463
selling for less than intrinsic
value, so you know just from

00:32:56.463 --> 00:33:03.880
arbitrage that that pink line is
always above the solid line.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:08.541
Moreover, there's another
arbitrage relation which I

00:33:08.541 --> 00:33:12.285
didn't show on the chart,
but if we draw a 45º

00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:15.192
line here from the origin,
that's plotting the stock price

00:33:15.192 --> 00:33:19.443
against the stock price;
it has a slope of one and it

00:33:19.443 --> 00:33:23.540
comes out of the origin.
No option can be worth--can be

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.990
priced up above that 45º
line--above here.

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.490
In other words,
an option can never sell for

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.190
more than the stock.
Does that sound obvious?

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:36.237
Why would you pay--if the share
is selling for $25,

00:33:36.237 --> 00:33:40.690
why would I pay $30 for the
right to buy at that $20?

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:45.630
Obviously it's ridiculous;
the stock itself is an option

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:49.518
to buy the share at a $0
exercise price,

00:33:49.518 --> 00:33:55.400
so it has to be worse to have a
positive exercise price.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.714
Now, I wanted to stress the
put-call parity relation and

00:34:00.714 --> 00:34:05.048
this is another arbitrage thing.
The put option

00:34:05.048 --> 00:34:09.764
price--arbitrage--the absence of
arbitrage opportunities implies

00:34:09.764 --> 00:34:14.480
that the put option price minus
the call option price equals the

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:18.597
present value of the strike
price--that's discounting it

00:34:18.597 --> 00:34:23.164
from this exercise date to the
present--plus the present value

00:34:23.164 --> 00:34:28.330
of any dividends coming between
today and the exercise date,

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:32.832
minus the price of the stock.
This has to hold because if it

00:34:32.832 --> 00:34:36.690
didn't hold, there would be an
arbitrage opportunity.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:41.139
The put--let me just show you
why.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:45.019
This diagram is supposed to
explain that.

00:34:45.019 --> 00:34:48.476
I've got here the intrinsic
value of the call,

00:34:48.476 --> 00:34:52.701
which is the yellow line,
and this is an intrinsic value

00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:55.665
of a put.
We've got them both at the same

00:34:55.665 --> 00:34:59.385
exercise price.
Then, I've shown here the stock

00:34:59.385 --> 00:35:04.262
price on the blue line;
stock price against stock price

00:35:04.262 --> 00:35:08.391
is just a 45º
line--a line with a slope of

00:35:08.391 --> 00:35:11.568
one.
Well, you notice that if I were

00:35:11.568 --> 00:35:16.008
to buy a call and write a
put--that's the same thing as

00:35:16.008 --> 00:35:20.776
shorting a put--I would have a
combined portfolio with just

00:35:20.776 --> 00:35:23.651
those two.
I would have the yellow line

00:35:23.651 --> 00:35:26.230
here and I'd have minus the pink
line here.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:30.580
I would have a parallel
straight line that looks just

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:34.010
like the stock price just
shifted down.

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:37.934
If I buy a call and short a
put--or write a put--it's the

00:35:37.934 --> 00:35:42.000
same thing as owning the stock
minus the exercise price.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.300
So, that's what we have in the
put-call parity relation,

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:49.739
so that we're taking account of
dividends.

00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:52.930
That diagram didn't show the
fact that stocks will pay--might

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.590
pay dividends between now and
the exercise date.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.950
You can see what I was just
saying.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:04.320
I've got--I said call minus put.
Well, this is put minus call,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:09.121
minus the price of stock.
I have a minus sign in front of

00:36:09.121 --> 00:36:12.443
everything here,
but it's just what that diagram

00:36:12.443 --> 00:36:14.946
shows.
What put-call parity means is

00:36:14.946 --> 00:36:18.873
that we only need a theory of
either call prices or put prices

00:36:18.873 --> 00:36:22.800
and then the other one falls
right out of put-call parity.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.856
All I need is a theory of call
prices, so we will just forget

00:36:27.856 --> 00:36:32.659
about puts and we'll just talk
about calls from now on.

00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:37.086
If I give you a problem to ask
you--what is the put price--what

00:36:37.086 --> 00:36:41.097
is the price of a put?
You would go in and calculate

00:36:41.097 --> 00:36:45.929
the price of a call and then
calculate the put option price.

00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:48.289
We'll put this on right hand of
the equation.

00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:51.883
The put price would equal the
call price plus the present

00:36:51.883 --> 00:36:54.888
value of the strike price,
plus the present value of

00:36:54.888 --> 00:36:56.870
dividends, minus the price of
the stock;

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:04.579
so, that makes it very easy.
All we have to do is worry

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:09.769
about calls.
Where am I?

00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:14.685
The question for financial
theory is, what determines this

00:37:14.685 --> 00:37:17.496
pink line?
You agree that it should be

00:37:17.496 --> 00:37:21.005
above intrinsic value.
As the option gets closer to

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:25.282
expiration--as time moves on and
the exercise date is getting

00:37:25.282 --> 00:37:29.194
closer and closer in time,
this pink line is going to go

00:37:29.194 --> 00:37:32.199
down, down, down.
On the last day,

00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:38.153
it hits the intrinsic value.
What is it before the exercise

00:37:38.153 --> 00:37:41.505
date?
I'm going to start with a

00:37:41.505 --> 00:37:47.969
theory, which illustrates how we
calculate these things.

00:37:47.969 --> 00:37:54.142
This is a theory that applies
to--so that we can understand it

00:37:54.142 --> 00:37:59.099
easily--that applies to a
strip-down situation.

00:37:59.099 --> 00:38:03.179
I'm going to derive the price
of an option under the

00:38:03.179 --> 00:38:05.980
assumption that it's very
simple.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.160
There's only one period between
now and exercise;

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:13.893
it's a European option.
We're going to exercise it in

00:38:13.893 --> 00:38:18.361
one--we have an exercise date of
one period and also under the

00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:23.048
restrictive assumption--and this
is for pedagogical purposes just

00:38:23.048 --> 00:38:26.929
to simplify option theory--that
the stock price,

00:38:26.929 --> 00:38:31.510
S, is the stock price
today.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:36.627
The stock--this stock is very
special because next period it

00:38:36.627 --> 00:38:41.301
can have only two values.
It's S times u if

00:38:41.301 --> 00:38:44.179
the stock goes up;
u stands for up.

00:38:44.179 --> 00:38:49.860
It's S times d if
the stock price goes down.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.448
What I'm saying--what's
arbitrary here is,

00:38:52.448 --> 00:38:56.046
I'm saying that there are only
two possible prices for the

00:38:56.046 --> 00:38:58.950
stock next period--Su or
Sd.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.478
That's not real world because
as you know there are all kinds

00:39:05.478 --> 00:39:07.599
of infinite number of possible
prices next period.

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:11.293
Again, this is just--I think
that we should be able to figure

00:39:11.293 --> 00:39:14.864
out what the price of a call
option on this stock should be

00:39:14.864 --> 00:39:17.900
worth.
It's very simple.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:22.175
They say it's very simple,
but the people who invented

00:39:22.175 --> 00:39:25.079
this won the Nobel Prize for
this,

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:29.331
so I won't--I don't want to
make it--this wasn't so simple

00:39:29.331 --> 00:39:32.239
in the history of financial
thinking.

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:37.030
Do you understand the situation
that we're proposing in?

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.489
It's just like--there's this
very funny stock that we

00:39:39.489 --> 00:39:42.374
know--for some reason we know
that S is the price today

00:39:42.374 --> 00:39:44.838
and next period,
when the option exercise date

00:39:44.838 --> 00:39:48.031
is, its price is either going to
be Su or it's going to

00:39:48.031 --> 00:39:51.277
be--S times u--or
it's going to be S times

00:39:51.277 --> 00:39:53.656
d.
Then, there's an interest rate

00:39:53.656 --> 00:39:57.170
and we can both borrow and lend
at this riskless interest rate.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:01.415
What should the option be worth?
In this case,

00:40:01.415 --> 00:40:07.889
I'm going to call C the
current price of the call today.

00:40:07.889 --> 00:40:10.920
Now, this is before the
exercise date,

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.671
so the price of the call is
going to be worth more than the

00:40:15.671 --> 00:40:18.756
intrinsic value.
I'm going to call

00:40:18.756 --> 00:40:23.863
C_u the value
of the call next period if the

00:40:23.863 --> 00:40:27.694
price is up and
C_d the value

00:40:27.694 --> 00:40:31.949
of the call next period if the
price is down.

00:40:31.949 --> 00:40:36.264
That's the thing that we read
off of those broken straight

00:40:36.264 --> 00:40:38.972
lines.
So, C_u would

00:40:38.972 --> 00:40:43.037
be the stock price minus--it's
the stock minus the exercise

00:40:43.037 --> 00:40:47.763
price if it's in the money.
We know that in advance because

00:40:47.763 --> 00:40:53.010
we already know what the two
possible prices are next period;

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.805
so, we already know what the
two possible option values are

00:40:55.805 --> 00:40:59.108
next period.
This is the intrinsic value if

00:40:59.108 --> 00:41:03.840
it's up and this is the
intrinsic value if it's down.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.407
We'll call E the strike
price of the exercise price of

00:41:07.407 --> 00:41:10.309
the option.
Is everything clear here?

00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:13.219
It's just such a very simple
world.

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:17.809
I'm just saying there are only
two possibilities;

00:41:17.809 --> 00:41:22.517
it's a very simple world and
there's only period between now

00:41:22.517 --> 00:41:25.389
and exercise,
so it's very simple.

00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:29.278
Now, what I'm going to
say--we're going to develop an

00:41:29.278 --> 00:41:33.988
arbitrage theory of options and
we're going to say that you want

00:41:33.988 --> 00:41:38.400
to--you'll take any profit
opportunity that's riskless.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.892
It ought to be possible to get
a riskless profit opportunity

00:41:41.892 --> 00:41:45.266
here by investing both in the
stock and the option because

00:41:45.266 --> 00:41:48.699
there are only two possible
values for the stock and you've

00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:52.853
got both a stock and an option.
There must be a riskless

00:41:52.853 --> 00:41:57.762
portfolio because the price of
the option depends only on the

00:41:57.762 --> 00:42:01.280
price of the stock on the
exercise date.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:05.780
What I'm going to do is get an
optimal hedge ratio,

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:09.019
H, that makes my
portfolio.

00:42:09.019 --> 00:42:12.954
I'm going to form a portfolio
of the stock and the option and

00:42:12.954 --> 00:42:16.561
I'm going to put them together
so that I have a riskless

00:42:16.561 --> 00:42:20.599
portfolio;
that's what I'm going to do.

00:42:20.599 --> 00:42:24.330
Out of that is going to fall a
value for the price of the

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.219
option.
This is what you want to do.

00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:31.030
We're looking for a riskless
profit opportunity.

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:35.353
Let's consider this,
we're going to write one call

00:42:35.353 --> 00:42:40.912
and buy H shares and I'm
going to pick H so that I

00:42:40.912 --> 00:42:45.171
have no risk at all.
It's easy to see how you do

00:42:45.171 --> 00:42:48.977
that because we already
know--before the exercise

00:42:48.977 --> 00:42:53.339
date--we know that if the price
goes up it will be worth

00:42:53.339 --> 00:42:57.860
uHS--my portfolio--if I
have H shares,

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.420
the H shares will be
worth uHS.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:07.472
uS is the price;
H shares will be worth

00:43:07.472 --> 00:43:13.402
uHS.
I've written one call so this

00:43:13.402 --> 00:43:21.010
would be worth uHS minus
the price of a call.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:24.011
Similarly, if the price
stock--if the stock price goes

00:43:24.011 --> 00:43:26.900
down, then this is the
value--intrinsic value of the

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.831
call,
then next period on the

00:43:29.831 --> 00:43:35.833
exercise date the portfolio will
be worth dHS minus

00:43:35.833 --> 00:43:41.214
C_D.
Let's choose H so that

00:43:41.214 --> 00:43:45.508
the two are the same.
All I have to do is set this

00:43:45.508 --> 00:43:49.841
equal to this and solve for
H and that gives me the

00:43:49.841 --> 00:43:53.407
optimal hedge ratio.
So, H is equal to

00:43:53.407 --> 00:43:57.118
C_u –
C_d,

00:43:57.118 --> 00:44:00.449
all over (u –
d) x S.

00:44:00.449 --> 00:44:06.019
Now it's very simple to get to
option pricing.

00:44:06.019 --> 00:44:11.242
If I can form this portfolio
where I have [short]

00:44:11.242 --> 00:44:17.010
one call and [long]
H shares in a portfolio,

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.026
it's a riskless portfolio,
so it has to earn the riskless

00:44:20.026 --> 00:44:23.929
rate of interest.
That's what no arbitrage

00:44:23.929 --> 00:44:27.190
assures.
It can't be possible to get a

00:44:27.190 --> 00:44:31.475
riskless portfolio that earns
either more or less than the

00:44:31.475 --> 00:44:35.534
riskless rate because if that
did happen I would have a

00:44:35.534 --> 00:44:40.346
riskless opportunity--ability to
earn more than the riskless rate

00:44:40.346 --> 00:44:45.900
with no risk.
That's contrary to arbitrage.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.532
The return on--since you
invested HS - C in the

00:44:50.532 --> 00:44:56.038
portfolio, the return on it--the
total value of it--has to equal

00:44:56.038 --> 00:45:00.233
(one plus the riskless rate)
times (HS –

00:45:00.233 --> 00:45:04.920
C).
If you substitute in for HS

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:09.773
– C,
you find out that it equals

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:12.566
this.
Substitute for H into

00:45:12.566 --> 00:45:15.599
this and you get the price of
the call today.

00:45:15.599 --> 00:45:19.969
It's simple algebra,
but there it is.

00:45:19.969 --> 00:45:24.800
So, that's the arbitrage theory
call option price.

00:45:27.809 --> 00:45:30.559
That might be less than
intuitive to you.

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:33.780
See, that was very simple
arguing that got us there.

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:37.251
We merely said,
the way to think about options

00:45:37.251 --> 00:45:41.262
is that options move with the
stock price and they're

00:45:41.262 --> 00:45:45.814
perfectly correlated with the
stock price over this interval

00:45:45.814 --> 00:45:49.902
because if the stock price goes
up you know you've got

00:45:49.902 --> 00:45:53.128
C_u.
If the stock price goes down,

00:45:53.128 --> 00:45:54.559
you know you've got
C_d.

00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:57.891
So, you have only one source of
uncertainty but you have two

00:45:57.891 --> 00:46:01.110
assets, so you can put them
together to eliminate risk.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:03.988
If you put them together that
way they have to earn the

00:46:03.988 --> 00:46:07.240
riskless rate and you just solve
for it and you get this value

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.383
for the call option.
This is the inherent insight

00:46:11.383 --> 00:46:17.722
that Black and Scholes came up
with in their classic 1973 paper

00:46:17.722 --> 00:46:21.227
on option pricing,
which I've come to,

00:46:21.227 --> 00:46:25.586
but this has to be the price of
the call option in this simple

00:46:25.586 --> 00:46:28.327
world;
otherwise, there would be

00:46:28.327 --> 00:46:30.873
arbitrage.
The interesting thing about

00:46:30.873 --> 00:46:34.300
this is that there are no
probabilities in this formula.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:39.050
What's in this formula?
I've got the riskless rate;

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:42.393
I've got intrinsic value;
I've got the difference between

00:46:42.393 --> 00:46:44.575
the price and the two
circumstances,

00:46:44.575 --> 00:46:47.070
but nothing to do with
probabilities.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:50.115
This puzzled people.
People thought,

00:46:50.115 --> 00:46:53.120
well doesn't the price of an
option have to depend on the

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.590
probability that it will come in
the money?

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:58.087
If it's an out of the money
option, don't I weigh the

00:46:58.087 --> 00:47:01.230
probability?
It's not in this formula.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:04.197
You might say,
it's implicitly in the formula

00:47:04.197 --> 00:47:07.704
because the relationship of
S to Su and

00:47:07.704 --> 00:47:10.200
Sd involves
probabilities,

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:14.199
but it's not in this formula.
Black and Scholes,

00:47:14.199 --> 00:47:20.120
in their famous paper,
used this kind of reasoning to

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:27.179
get to the standard option
contract, which--option formula.

00:47:27.179 --> 00:47:30.480
I'm not going to derive it
because the mathematics is quite

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.811
a bit more difficult,
but it's exactly the same logic

00:47:33.811 --> 00:47:37.462
that I just went through with
the binomial option pricing

00:47:37.462 --> 00:47:44.273
formula.
This is one of the most famous

00:47:44.273 --> 00:47:52.234
formulas in all of finance.
What Black-Scholes did is,

00:47:52.234 --> 00:47:57.394
under certain assumptions about
the stochastic properties of

00:47:57.394 --> 00:48:01.943
stock prices and under the
assumption of no arbitrage

00:48:01.943 --> 00:48:06.977
opportunity,
they came up with a formula

00:48:06.977 --> 00:48:14.860
that an option price should
follow if there's no arbitrage.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:20.376
I'm just going to present their
formula and then we'll think

00:48:20.376 --> 00:48:24.639
more about options.
The Black-Scholes formula--call

00:48:24.639 --> 00:48:28.537
T the time to exercise.
Before, I just said it

00:48:28.537 --> 00:48:32.748
was--when we talked binomial,
I just had--I said it was one

00:48:32.748 --> 00:48:35.392
period hence,
but now we're allowing the

00:48:35.392 --> 00:48:38.130
exercise date to be any distance
in the future.

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:43.030
So, T is the time to the
exercise date.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.855
This is for our European
option, although it's often used

00:48:46.855 --> 00:48:49.519
to apply to American options as
well.

00:48:49.519 --> 00:48:55.030
We'll call σ^(2) the
variance of the one-period price

00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:59.389
change.
N(x) is the cumulative

00:48:59.389 --> 00:49:06.489
normal distribution function,
which you can find on Excel;

00:49:06.489 --> 00:49:13.922
it's called normdist,
so I don't want to get into

00:49:13.922 --> 00:49:19.085
these details.
This is the formula that

00:49:19.085 --> 00:49:23.449
Black-Scholes won the Nobel
Prize for.

00:49:23.449 --> 00:49:27.404
Well actually,
Black died at a relatively

00:49:27.404 --> 00:49:33.180
early age from throat cancer;
he was a heavy smoker and

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:39.142
people don't do that anymore,
so that's one risk that is

00:49:39.142 --> 00:49:42.249
over.
Scholes won the Nobel Prize for

00:49:42.249 --> 00:49:46.295
this--they don't award that
posthumously--for this little

00:49:46.295 --> 00:49:49.622
formula.
It says, the price of a call is

00:49:49.622 --> 00:49:54.442
equal to the stock price times
N(d_1) minus

00:49:54.442 --> 00:49:58.690
the exercise price times
N(d_2),

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:01.487
where d_1 is
given by this expression and

00:50:01.487 --> 00:50:03.990
d_2 is given by
this expression.

00:50:07.809 --> 00:50:09.590
That might not be intuitive to
you.

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:12.537
We could spend a couple of
lectures making that more

00:50:12.537 --> 00:50:16.119
intuitive, but I'm just going to
stop with that formula now.

00:50:16.119 --> 00:50:21.116
That's the formula that I used
back here to make this pink

00:50:21.116 --> 00:50:23.862
line.
I just--I had to plug in a

00:50:23.862 --> 00:50:28.291
value for σ^(2) and
T, but I did that and I

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:32.651
used the Black-Scholes formula.
The Black-Scholes formula does

00:50:32.651 --> 00:50:38.362
what we sort of think it should.
The price of an option should

00:50:38.362 --> 00:50:44.680
be greater than the intrinsic
value everywhere,

00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:49.350
but here is the exact equation.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:56.880
This is one of the most famous
equations in finance.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.783
It might even be on your--if
you have a financial calculator

00:50:59.783 --> 00:51:01.849
you might have a key that you
can press.

00:51:01.849 --> 00:51:04.892
It's already on your laptop and
you don't even know it

00:51:04.892 --> 00:51:08.510
probably--maybe--depending on
what kind of programs you have.

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:12.961
It's easy to compute in Excel;
you just have to use this

00:51:12.961 --> 00:51:15.356
normdist.
This cumulative normal

00:51:15.356 --> 00:51:19.880
distribution function is not
something you can do by hand;

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:26.268
you have to use a--it would
involve an integral that doesn't

00:51:26.268 --> 00:51:32.440
have an analytic solution,
but you can get it on Excel.

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:42.143
Now, the critical problem with
the Black-Scholes formula,

00:51:42.143 --> 00:51:46.678
however, is getting some of
these parameters that have to go

00:51:46.678 --> 00:51:50.059
into it and the tough one is
σ^(2);

00:51:50.059 --> 00:51:52.369
most of the other things we
know.

00:51:52.369 --> 00:51:55.967
If you're trying to actually
price an option using

00:51:55.967 --> 00:51:58.830
Black-Scholes,
S, we already know

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:03.059
that's just the stock price.
E is the exercise price;

00:52:03.059 --> 00:52:05.679
we know that--that's written in
the option contract.

00:52:05.679 --> 00:52:09.230
T is the time to
expiration date;

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:10.869
we know that--that's written in
the contract.

00:52:10.869 --> 00:52:13.030
r is the riskless
interest rate;

00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:15.818
well, that's easy to
tell--that's just quoted in the

00:52:15.818 --> 00:52:18.112
market.
There's only one thing that

00:52:18.112 --> 00:52:21.050
remains that's tough and that's
σ^(2).

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:24.599
That's the variance of the
stock price.

00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:30.430
Black-Scholes says you have to
know how variable the stock

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:36.670
price is to price an option and
intuitively you can see it.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:41.909
Isn't it obvious that the more
variable the stock price the

00:52:41.909 --> 00:52:46.625
more valuable the option is?
If the variance were zero,

00:52:46.625 --> 00:52:50.944
then the option would just be
the intrinsic value because

00:52:50.944 --> 00:52:55.650
there's no chance for the stock
to do anything unexpected.

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:59.341
If it's out of the money and
the variance is zero,

00:52:59.341 --> 00:53:02.761
the option is worthless.
If it's in the money and the

00:53:02.761 --> 00:53:05.005
variance is zero,
then it's worth something,

00:53:05.005 --> 00:53:07.250
but it's only worth the
intrinsic value.

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.693
If σ^(2) is 0,
the price can't move anywhere,

00:53:10.693 --> 00:53:14.690
so there's no problem.
As σ^(2) increases,

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:18.539
the option gets more and more
valuable;

00:53:18.539 --> 00:53:21.783
if it's out of the money it's
getting more and more chance to

00:53:21.783 --> 00:53:24.539
come into the money and so
that's in the formula.

00:53:24.539 --> 00:53:29.729
The key variable in the
Black-Scholes formula is the

00:53:29.729 --> 00:53:35.020
variance of option--of the
underlying stock price;

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:40.119
that's the kicker;
that's the hard part.

00:53:40.119 --> 00:53:43.877
People who trade options use
the Black-Scholes formula,

00:53:43.877 --> 00:53:48.121
but there's a problem and the
problem is you've got to plug in

00:53:48.121 --> 00:53:52.697
a number for σ^(2).
So, what number should I plug

00:53:52.697 --> 00:53:54.232
in?
Well, you might say,

00:53:54.232 --> 00:53:57.704
let's take historical numbers.
I know pretty much what the

00:53:57.704 --> 00:53:59.909
variance of stock price changes
is;

00:53:59.909 --> 00:54:02.280
let's use the historical
variance.

00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:07.480
I wanted to show you the
historical variance of stock

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.245
prices.
I have--since I like history,

00:54:10.245 --> 00:54:14.845
I go all the way back to 1871.
What I did to compute this

00:54:14.845 --> 00:54:20.556
chart is I took the S&amp;P
composite or S&amp;P 500 Index

00:54:20.556 --> 00:54:23.751
back to 1871.
This is my spreadsheet,

00:54:23.751 --> 00:54:27.280
which is on the web under our
classroom materials.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.211
I took a six-month moving
average of six-month

00:54:32.211 --> 00:54:38.128
changes--six-month standard
deviation of the percentage

00:54:38.128 --> 00:54:42.949
price change for every month
from 1871, July,

00:54:42.949 --> 00:54:47.215
to April of 2008.
The important thing to

00:54:47.215 --> 00:54:51.895
understand here is that the
variance is not constant through

00:54:51.895 --> 00:54:54.059
time;
it moves around.

00:54:54.059 --> 00:54:57.947
There are high variance periods
for stock prices and low

00:54:57.947 --> 00:55:00.923
variance periods.
I like to look at this picture

00:55:00.923 --> 00:55:03.737
because it's interesting.
The first thing that is

00:55:03.737 --> 00:55:06.652
interesting is that,
overall, the market has been

00:55:06.652 --> 00:55:09.690
remarkably consistent for over a
hundred years.

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:14.128
The variance back in the
nineteenth century doesn't look

00:55:14.128 --> 00:55:16.970
any different;
nothing has changed in a

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:20.238
hundred and thirty years;
the market has always been

00:55:20.238 --> 00:55:22.347
volatile.
There's only one thing that

00:55:22.347 --> 00:55:25.786
jumps out at you when you look
at this picture and that's these

00:55:25.786 --> 00:55:28.684
numbers in here.
You notice those numbers in the

00:55:28.684 --> 00:55:31.557
middle?
That was the Great Depression

00:55:31.557 --> 00:55:36.682
of the 1930s and something went
really haywire in the financial

00:55:36.682 --> 00:55:40.469
markets in the Depression.
This is 1929;

00:55:40.469 --> 00:55:43.180
it wasn't so much 1929,
but remember this is a

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.530
six-month--it's a lagging six
months.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:50.699
So, where does it--maybe the
1929 crash is here somewhere.

00:55:50.699 --> 00:55:54.977
I'm not sure exactly where it
is, but something went really

00:55:54.977 --> 00:55:58.886
haywire after 1929 and the
markets got extraordinarily

00:55:58.886 --> 00:56:00.730
volatile for a while.

00:56:04.059 --> 00:56:08.138
That was a crisis period in
American history that shows up

00:56:08.138 --> 00:56:12.359
really well on this picture,
but since then nothing much has

00:56:12.359 --> 00:56:14.292
happened.
It's interesting to look

00:56:14.292 --> 00:56:15.903
recently.
This doesn't look very

00:56:15.903 --> 00:56:18.582
important;
it shows how important our

00:56:18.582 --> 00:56:23.547
lifetimes in the broad sweep of
history, but your lifetimes are

00:56:23.547 --> 00:56:28.561
from in this region right here.
The thing that's interesting is

00:56:28.561 --> 00:56:33.071
that we have been recently in a
very low volatility period for

00:56:33.071 --> 00:56:36.889
the stock market.
This is around 2003.

00:56:36.889 --> 00:56:40.655
We were in a high volatility
period in the 1990s--nothing

00:56:40.655 --> 00:56:44.719
like in the Great Depression,
but high in the '90s and then

00:56:44.719 --> 00:56:48.883
volatility just collapsed and
the markets were the deadest and

00:56:48.883 --> 00:56:52.570
dullest place to be in the
world--the stock market.

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:58.011
Partly, I think this is because
our--we were--who knows why this

00:56:58.011 --> 00:57:00.128
was.
I'm going to throw out a wild

00:57:00.128 --> 00:57:02.797
suggestion.
It's because we were distracted

00:57:02.797 --> 00:57:06.424
by the housing bubble and all
talk after the stock market

00:57:06.424 --> 00:57:08.964
peaked in 2000.
Lots of people just lost

00:57:08.964 --> 00:57:12.458
interest in the market and all
of their speculative enthusiasm

00:57:12.458 --> 00:57:15.550
was focused on housing and the
stock market was kind of

00:57:15.550 --> 00:57:17.733
forgotten.
There has to be at least an

00:57:17.733 --> 00:57:20.329
element of truth to that story,
but something has been

00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:22.721
happening lately.
Look how much volatility is

00:57:22.721 --> 00:57:25.724
shooting up now;
this is because of the world

00:57:25.724 --> 00:57:30.539
financial crisis that we're in.
If you look at this picture it

00:57:30.539 --> 00:57:34.619
doesn't look like the world
financial crisis is very

00:57:34.619 --> 00:57:39.739
important compared to historical
events so far that we've seen in

00:57:39.739 --> 00:57:43.287
the past.
Now, I want to define what we

00:57:43.287 --> 00:57:47.957
call implied volatility.
What the--you can do with the

00:57:47.957 --> 00:57:52.402
Black-Scholes formula is it
requires that you input

00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:58.179
σ^(2) to calculate what the
price of an option should be.

00:57:58.179 --> 00:58:02.123
Why don't we take what the
price of the option is and work

00:58:02.123 --> 00:58:05.998
backwards to figure out what
volatility is implied by the

00:58:05.998 --> 00:58:08.929
price.
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:58:08.929 --> 00:58:12.195
You can solve--you can turn the
Black-Scholes--the Black-Scholes

00:58:12.195 --> 00:58:15.460
formula gives the price of the
option in terms of σ^(2).

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.066
Well, I can turn it around
because I know what the market

00:58:18.066 --> 00:58:21.449
price of the option is;
they're traded on the CBOE.

00:58:21.449 --> 00:58:24.915
So, I would take the market
price of an option and turn it

00:58:24.915 --> 00:58:27.895
around and get what the implied
volatility is from

00:58:27.895 --> 00:58:31.736
Black-Scholes.
The CBOE does this for you

00:58:31.736 --> 00:58:37.758
because they trade S&amp;P 500
options and they have it on

00:58:37.758 --> 00:58:43.780
their website and its called
VIX, so I have VIX there.

00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:50.219
That's their volatility index.
The CBOE was created in 1973.

00:58:50.219 --> 00:58:53.893
Unfortunately,
the series doesn't--it goes

00:58:53.893 --> 00:58:58.193
only back to 1986,
but it's been going for a long

00:58:58.193 --> 00:59:00.635
time.
You can't get implied

00:59:00.635 --> 00:59:04.606
volatility back to 1871
because--although there were

00:59:04.606 --> 00:59:09.199
options traded back then,
there was no organized market.

00:59:09.199 --> 00:59:12.673
You can't get a consistent
series of prices of options

00:59:12.673 --> 00:59:15.556
going that far back,
so you can't get implied

00:59:15.556 --> 00:59:18.402
volatility.
Maybe you could do it if you

00:59:18.402 --> 00:59:21.993
got some records from some
broker and find some option,

00:59:21.993 --> 00:59:26.199
but it would be hard.
Our implied volatility only

00:59:26.199 --> 00:59:32.193
goes back a little over twenty
years, but the interesting thing

00:59:32.193 --> 00:59:37.896
is I have plotted here both the
implied volatility over that

00:59:37.896 --> 00:59:41.570
period and the actual
volatility.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:45.367
You see that they line up
fairly well, but this shows the

00:59:45.367 --> 00:59:48.079
strength of the Black-Scholes
formula.

00:59:48.079 --> 00:59:52.597
Black-Scholes does seem to be
pricing options well enough

00:59:52.597 --> 00:59:57.783
because the implied volatility,
while it's not perfectly

00:59:57.783 --> 01:00:03.987
exactly equal to the actual
volatility, it's close and so we

01:00:03.987 --> 01:00:08.719
can see that the formula makes
some sense.

01:00:08.719 --> 01:00:16.668
I just wanted to conclude this
lecture by talking about the

01:00:16.668 --> 01:00:24.343
effort we've made to get
single-family home price options

01:00:24.343 --> 01:00:30.510
going at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.484
As I told you,
I and some of my colleagues

01:00:33.484 --> 01:00:37.328
have been campaigning with
futures exchanges to create

01:00:37.328 --> 01:00:40.230
futures markets for home prices
and,

01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:43.774
ultimately, for commercial real
estate prices and other economic

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:46.552
variables.
We went to--we started

01:00:46.552 --> 01:00:52.383
campaigning almost twenty years
ago, but recently we have been

01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:57.353
talking with the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and they

01:00:57.353 --> 01:01:02.705
created futures markets for
single-family homes in May of

01:01:02.705 --> 01:01:07.579
2006 using the S&amp;P
Case-Shiller Indexes.

01:01:07.579 --> 01:01:12.389
That was our objective,
but when we went there the CME

01:01:12.389 --> 01:01:17.471
said, well why don't we start
options as well--options on

01:01:17.471 --> 01:01:20.530
futures.
So, we have a futures contract

01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:23.289
and they launched options on
home prices.

01:01:23.289 --> 01:01:26.768
You can see all these things on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange

01:01:26.768 --> 01:01:27.330
website.

01:01:32.099 --> 01:01:37.675
What we have now are both puts
and calls for ten U.S.

01:01:37.675 --> 01:01:39.380
cities.
Unfortunately,

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.150
they're not doing well;
they're not selling well,

01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:48.650
but they're still going and
we're hoping that we can get

01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:52.396
them to connect.
Often markets are slow at

01:01:52.396 --> 01:01:56.829
first, so I hope that that's the
story--that it's just a slow

01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:59.219
beginning.
Let me say what we have;

01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:03.868
maybe it's a good down to earth
way to illustrate the value of

01:02:03.868 --> 01:02:06.463
options.
I was telling you how to price

01:02:06.463 --> 01:02:09.519
options, but I didn't tell why
would you buy one.

01:02:09.519 --> 01:02:12.099
Well, I did tell a story at the
beginning.

01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:16.242
I talked about an investor
wanting to invest money in

01:02:16.242 --> 01:02:20.543
options and a writer hoping that
the option will expire

01:02:20.543 --> 01:02:23.809
unexercised and hoping to make
money.

01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:29.201
I didn't really go behind that
and emphasize why you would do

01:02:29.201 --> 01:02:32.812
that.
I think the example of a home

01:02:32.812 --> 01:02:36.309
price option is very easy to
see.

01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:40.335
Let's consider a situation that
someone--I don't think any of

01:02:40.335 --> 01:02:43.019
you are homeowners here at this
point;

01:02:43.019 --> 01:02:45.929
maybe some of you are--probably
not.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:50.428
But imagine--try to imagine
that you bought a house a couple

01:02:50.428 --> 01:02:54.469
years ago and now the housing
market is collapsing.

01:02:54.469 --> 01:02:57.811
You bought that house probably
on a mortgage,

01:02:57.811 --> 01:03:02.292
so you borrowed 80 to 90% or
maybe even more of the money to

01:03:02.292 --> 01:03:05.934
buy the house.
Now, the home is falling and

01:03:05.934 --> 01:03:08.860
you're thinking,
hey wait a minute.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.990
This house is worth less than
my debt and you start to get

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.574
upset.
You're thinking,

01:03:14.574 --> 01:03:17.461
well you know I'd like to move
to another city,

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:19.909
but then you realize,
I can't do it.

01:03:19.909 --> 01:03:23.862
If I sell my house,
I won't be able to pay off the

01:03:23.862 --> 01:03:27.606
mortgage;
I'll be bankrupt before I--I

01:03:27.606 --> 01:03:30.239
can't move.
This is very real.

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:33.172
In fact, economy.com,
a consulting firm,

01:03:33.172 --> 01:03:37.458
estimates that in the United
States today 10% of all homes

01:03:37.458 --> 01:03:41.703
are underwater in that sense.
The mortgage debt is greater

01:03:41.703 --> 01:03:45.168
than the value of the home and
that number is increasing

01:03:45.168 --> 01:03:47.940
everyday as home prices continue
to fall.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:52.820
Some people are very upset.
So, what can they do?

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:57.099
Well, one thing they can do or
they could have done a couple of

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.929
years ago if they had thought to
do it,

01:03:59.929 --> 01:04:04.874
they could buy a put on the
home--on homes in the city where

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:08.185
they have a house.
I put in, say,

01:04:08.185 --> 01:04:14.608
around--let's say I put in
$500,000 into a house and I'm

01:04:14.608 --> 01:04:18.929
worried that its price might
fall.

01:04:18.929 --> 01:04:23.864
Well, if you buy a house and
you buy a put on that house

01:04:23.864 --> 01:04:28.260
together, the two together
eliminate your risk.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.753
Let's think of it as just
buying a put on a house rather

01:04:31.753 --> 01:04:36.349
than on an index.
I buy the house for $500,000;

01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:41.120
I put up $400,000 and so--I put
up $100,000;

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.501
the mortgage puts up $400,000.
I'm underwater if the house

01:04:45.501 --> 01:04:48.901
drops $100,000.
I've lost--my mortgage debt

01:04:48.901 --> 01:04:53.503
exceeds my--I don't want that to
happen, so why don't I just buy

01:04:53.503 --> 01:04:58.403
a put on the house,
which is a right to sell the

01:04:58.403 --> 01:05:03.579
house at $400,000 until some
exercise date;

01:05:03.579 --> 01:05:07.739
then, I can't possibly be
underwater.

01:05:07.739 --> 01:05:11.318
If I ever decide to move or if
it's an American option,

01:05:11.318 --> 01:05:15.161
I can just--if the price of my
house is less than $400,000,

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:18.966
I'll just exercise my put.
There's no way for me to get

01:05:18.966 --> 01:05:21.891
wiped out.
In fact, I could buy a put at

01:05:21.891 --> 01:05:26.239
$450,000 and that way I would
always be sure that I'd have

01:05:26.239 --> 01:05:29.952
$50,000 left.
So, that's the idea of using

01:05:29.952 --> 01:05:32.800
options as a hedging mechanism.

01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:39.561
While I gave an example in
terms of real estate and it's

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:43.893
not widely used that way,
this same idea is used a lot by

01:05:43.893 --> 01:05:49.193
investors in other domains,
so I think options have a very

01:05:49.193 --> 01:05:54.434
real risk management purpose.
In a sense, an insurance

01:05:54.434 --> 01:05:59.700
contract is like a put option.
If I buy fire insurance on my

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:03.977
house, then it's like buying a
put option on my house,

01:06:03.977 --> 01:06:07.769
but it's only exercisable if
there's a fire.

01:06:07.769 --> 01:06:10.764
What it says is,
if my house burns down,

01:06:10.764 --> 01:06:14.910
the put option--I can sell
whatever remains at a price,

01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:18.750
which is determined by the
insurance contract;

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:23.764
it's the same as a put option.
Insurance is not fundamentally

01:06:23.764 --> 01:06:27.954
different from finance.
We've had a little trouble

01:06:27.954 --> 01:06:31.287
deciding whether we want home
equity insurance or just

01:06:31.287 --> 01:06:34.619
puts--home equity puts--so we've
created the puts.

01:06:34.619 --> 01:06:37.832
At some point,
we want to also create

01:06:37.832 --> 01:06:40.510
insurance on homes,
someday;

01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:43.190
I hope that happens.
There is no home equity

01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.860
insurance.

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:49.417
These are just different
incarnations of the same risk

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:52.661
management ideas.
The fundamental idea here in

01:06:52.661 --> 01:06:57.175
finance is that you can
create--options are examples of

01:06:57.175 --> 01:07:02.099
derivatives;
I should add that a derivative

01:07:02.099 --> 01:07:09.559
is a financial contract that
derives from another financial.

01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:13.903
So, an option is a derivative
because the price of the option

01:07:13.903 --> 01:07:18.391
in the options market depends on
the price of something else in

01:07:18.391 --> 01:07:21.070
another market--the stock
market.

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:24.710
So, our real estate options are
another example of derivative.

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:28.460
The price of the put option
depends on--in the option

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:33.219
market--depends on the price of
the house in the housing market.

01:07:33.219 --> 01:07:36.230
One of the themes in my
forthcoming book,

01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:40.446
which I'm writing right now,
is that derivatives are like

01:07:40.446 --> 01:07:43.066
insurance.
They're fundamentally important

01:07:43.066 --> 01:07:46.148
to risk management vehicles and
they could have helped prevent

01:07:46.148 --> 01:07:49.180
the subprime crisis that we're
now in if they had just gotten

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:51.313
established and more developed.

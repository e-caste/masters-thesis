00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.485
Professor Shelly Kagan:
We've been working our way

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:06.030
through Plato's arguments for
the immortality of the soul.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.499
And last time I spent a fair
bit of time working through

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.086
objections to,
not quite the last argument

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:15.249
we're going to look at,
but the penultimate argument,

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.370
in which Plato tries to argue
for the simplicity of the soul.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.922
The set of connected ideas,
you'll recall,

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:24.532
were these: that Plato wants to
suggest that in order to be

00:00:24.532 --> 00:00:26.960
destroyed you've got to have
parts;

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.770
to destroy something is to
basically take its parts apart.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.803
If he could only convince us
that the soul was simple,

00:00:33.803 --> 00:00:36.435
it would follow that it was
indestructible and,

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:39.094
hence, immortal.
He asks, what's our evidence

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:41.150
for some things being
indestructible?

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.169
What kinds of things are simple?
Well, these are--he then goes

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:48.430
on to claim--invisible things,
things that don't change.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.366
After all, changing is a matter
of the rearrangement of the

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:54.636
parts.
And so, if something can

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:58.280
change, it can't be simple.
Maybe it could be destroyed.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.049
But if we could become
convinced that the soul was not

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.713
composite, if it was something
that couldn't change,

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:06.966
then it would simple.
Perhaps then it would

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:10.152
indestructible.
And then he goes on to suggest

00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:13.499
that the invisibility of the
soul is evidence for it's being

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:16.790
changeless, and hence simple,
and hence indestructible.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.470
So that's the argument we
worked through last time.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.693
And I spent a fair bit of time
suggesting that if you pin down

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:26.848
precisely what Plato means by
invisible, the argument doesn't

00:01:26.848 --> 00:01:30.085
actually go through.
Before leaving that argument,

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:33.400
there are a couple of extra
remarks I want to make about it.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.463
First, we probably shouldn't
have been so quick to want to

00:01:38.463 --> 00:01:43.260
buy into the suggestion that the
soul is changeless.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.029
After all, if you think about
it, it seems that at least on

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:51.730
the face of it the soul does
indeed change.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.468
On one day you believe,
for example,

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:57.299
that it's hot;
on another day you believe that

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.898
it's cold.
On one day you believe that so

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:04.721
and so is a nice person;
on the next day you believe

00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:08.273
that so and so is a mean person.
You desire to learn the piano,

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:10.969
the next day you give up on
that desire.

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:13.806
Your beliefs,
your goals, your intentions,

00:02:13.806 --> 00:02:17.750
your desires--these things are
all constantly changing.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.858
And so, at least on the face of
it, it looks as though we might

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:24.016
well want to say the soul--if we
do believe there are souls--the

00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:27.801
soul is changing as well,
in terms of what thoughts and

00:02:27.801 --> 00:02:30.737
beliefs it's housing.
So we should have been

00:02:30.737 --> 00:02:33.710
skeptical in the first place of
any argument that said,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.571
based on the invisibility of
the soul, we can conclude that

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:41.981
it's changeless.
It doesn't seem to be in fact

00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:44.139
changeless.
Furthermore,

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.043
we should be,
or at least we might well be,

00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:50.500
skeptical of the claim that the
soul is simple.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.035
Indeed, Plato himself,
in other dialogues,

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:57.830
argues against the simplicity
of the soul.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.538
Now, that doesn't mean he's
right in the other dialogues,

00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:03.440
but at least suggests that we
shouldn't be so ready to assume

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.229
that sort of position is
correct.

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:07.823
In The Republic,
famously, Plato goes on to

00:03:07.823 --> 00:03:10.840
argue that the soul has at least
three different parts.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.229
There's a rational part that's
in charge of reasoning;

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.340
there's a spirited part that's
sort of like the will;

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.693
there's a part that has to do
with appetite,

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:25.280
desires for food,
drink, sex, what have you.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.560
Plato elsewhere argues the soul
is not simple at all.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.832
So perhaps it shouldn't shock
us that the argument he's

00:03:33.832 --> 00:03:38.026
sketching here for the
simplicity of the soul based on

00:03:38.026 --> 00:03:41.223
the changeless,
invisible nature of the

00:03:41.223 --> 00:03:45.714
soul--perhaps it shouldn't shock
us that that argument doesn't

00:03:45.714 --> 00:03:50.212
succeed after all.
Finally, although I gave Plato,

00:03:50.212 --> 00:03:56.023
previously, the assumption that
if only we could establish the

00:03:56.023 --> 00:04:00.431
simplicity of the soul,
it would follow that soul was

00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.029
indestructible--after all,
you couldn't break a soul by

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:07.560
tearing its pieces apart if it
didn't have pieces,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.098
if it didn't have
parts--nonetheless,

00:04:10.098 --> 00:04:14.117
I just want to register the
thought that it's not actually

00:04:14.117 --> 00:04:17.220
obvious that simples can't be
destroyed.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.965
Well, they clearly can't be
destroyed by the particular

00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:24.850
method of destruction that
involves taking them apart.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.370
If they don't have parts,
you can't take them apart.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.810
But for all that,
it still seems conceptually

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.954
possible for a simple to be
destroyed in the following

00:04:35.954 --> 00:04:40.059
sense: it goes out of existence.
After all, where did the

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:42.100
simples come from in the first
place?

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.974
Well, at least from a logical
point of view,

00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:48.985
it seems as though there's no
difficulty in imagining that at

00:04:48.985 --> 00:04:53.197
one point a given simple didn't
exist and then at the next point

00:04:53.197 --> 00:04:56.319
it popped into existence.
Well, how did that happen?

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.772
Maybe God said--God says at the
beginning of Genesis,

00:04:59.772 --> 00:05:02.680
"Let there be light."
So maybe He says,

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.608
"Let there be simples."
At a given moment they weren't

00:05:06.608 --> 00:05:08.360
there;
the next moment they were.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.884
Well, after a while maybe God
says, "Let the simples no longer

00:05:13.884 --> 00:05:16.290
exist."
Given moment there they were;

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.360
the next moment,
they no longer exist.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.215
Seems as though that idea makes
sense, and so even if we agreed

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:27.711
that the soul was simple,
even if we granted everything

00:05:27.711 --> 00:05:29.949
in Plato's argument up to this
point and said,

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.578
"the soul really is simple," it
still wouldn't follow that it's

00:05:34.578 --> 00:05:37.560
immortal.
We'd still have to worry about

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.809
the possibility that the simple
soul might simply pop out of

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:46.974
existence at a given point,
perhaps the very point when the

00:05:46.974 --> 00:05:50.789
body gets destroyed.
So I'm inclined to think that

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.104
this most recent argument of
Plato's--the argument from

00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:57.050
simplicity--no,
that's not successful either.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.351
Before leaving that argument,
there's one other piece

00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:02.463
of business I want to discuss.
This is a footnote that I put

00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:05.290
aside, a point that I put aside
previously.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.551
You'll recall that we were
worried about--The objection got

00:06:09.551 --> 00:06:13.593
raised the right way to think
about the soul is like the

00:06:13.593 --> 00:06:16.849
harmony of a harp.
And this was originally offered

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:19.757
as a counterexample to the
thought that invisible things

00:06:19.757 --> 00:06:22.300
couldn't be destroyed.
But harmony could be destroyed.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.686
It was invisible,
so invisible things could be

00:06:25.686 --> 00:06:27.340
destroyed.
But I noticed,

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.861
I mentioned that,
look, whether or not this is a

00:06:29.861 --> 00:06:32.810
problem for the argument,
it's an interesting suggestion

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.212
in its own right.
Because the suggestion that the

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:39.509
mind is to the body,
the soul is to the body,

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:42.970
like harmony is to an
instrument with strings,

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.199
seems to me to be an early
attempt to describe something

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:50.889
like the physicalist conception
of the mind.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.840
Just as harmony is something
that gets produced by a

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.326
well-tuned instrument,
the soul or the mind is

00:06:58.326 --> 00:07:02.509
something that gets produced by
a well-tuned body.

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.639
Now Plato's got some objections
to the suggestion that we should

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.720
think of the mind as the harmony
of the body.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.143
And so I want to take just a
moment and talk about those

00:07:13.143 --> 00:07:16.122
objections because,
of course, if they were

00:07:16.122 --> 00:07:20.775
compelling objections that might
well give us reason to doubt the

00:07:20.775 --> 00:07:23.477
physicalist view.
Whether or not Plato's

00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:26.086
arguments for the immortality of
the soul work,

00:07:26.086 --> 00:07:28.922
he might still have some good
arguments against the

00:07:28.922 --> 00:07:32.030
physicalist conception.
But in thinking about these

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.183
objections, it's important to
bear in mind that it's only

00:07:35.183 --> 00:07:38.450
meant--the harmony analogy is
only meant--as just that,

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.879
as an analogy.
Right?

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:45.051
The claim isn't,
or at least it shouldn't be,

00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:50.360
understood as saying literally,
"the mind is harmony."

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.898
It's rather,
the mind is like

00:07:53.898 --> 00:07:56.982
harmony;
it's the sort of thing to the

00:07:56.982 --> 00:08:01.342
body like harmony is to a harp,
something that can be produced

00:08:01.342 --> 00:08:05.129
by a well-functioning,
well-tuned physical object.

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:08.420
A well-tuned instrument can
produce melody and harmony.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.897
A well-tuned,
properly functioning body can

00:08:11.897 --> 00:08:15.339
produce mental activity.
That's the suggestion.

00:08:15.339 --> 00:08:19.235
And so even if it turns out
that there are some ways in

00:08:19.235 --> 00:08:22.410
which the mind isn't exactly
like harmony,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.800
it doesn't show us that the
physicalist view is wrong.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.550
Well, so let's quickly look at
what Plato's arguments were.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.239
First--this is,
I think, an interesting

00:08:32.239 --> 00:08:36.997
argument--Plato says,
harmony clearly cannot exist

00:08:36.997 --> 00:08:41.270
before the existence of the harp
itself.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.329
Right?
The melodiousness of the harp

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:48.810
can't exist prior to the
physical construction of the

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.482
harp.
And if mind were the sort of

00:08:51.482 --> 00:08:55.376
thing that was produced by the
proper functioning of the

00:08:55.376 --> 00:08:58.590
physical body,
then pretty obviously the mind

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.610
could not exist prior to the
creation of the physical body.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.175
However, Plato has already
argued earlier in the dialogue

00:09:07.175 --> 00:09:12.230
that the soul does exist prior
to the existence of the body.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.250
That's the argument from
recollection.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.240
If the soul exists prior to the
body, it can't be like harmony;

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.960
physicalism has clearly got to
be false.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.826
But I said that I didn't find
the argument--I tried to explain

00:09:24.826 --> 00:09:27.740
why I didn't find the argument
from recollection persuasive.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.624
I certainly do want to agree
that if we became convinced that

00:09:31.624 --> 00:09:35.250
the soul did exist prior to the
existence of the body,

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:40.116
we would certainly want to
agree that the soul is not like

00:09:40.116 --> 00:09:42.004
harmony.
But I don't think the argument

00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:42.970
from recollection succeeds.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:53.590
Plato's second objection is to
point out that harmony can vary.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:58.440
We talk about the melodiousness
of the harp.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.844
Well, it could be harmonious in
a variety of different ways and,

00:10:01.844 --> 00:10:03.520
indeed, to different degrees.

00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:12.220
Something--an instrument--could
be more or less harmonious.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.419
What it's playing can be in
greater or lesser harmony.

00:10:15.419 --> 00:10:19.940
But it doesn't seem as though
souls come in degrees.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.379
You've got a soul or you don't
have a soul.

00:10:23.379 --> 00:10:24.840
That's the argument,
that's the objection.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.350
You've got a mind or you don't
have a mind.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.998
But perhaps we should--That's
the objection,

00:10:29.998 --> 00:10:32.221
and of course if that was right
then again we might have to

00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:34.796
conclude,
well, whatever the mind is,

00:10:34.796 --> 00:10:38.179
it's not quite like harmony is
to the body.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:42.818
But I'm not so sure we should
agree that the mind can't come

00:10:42.818 --> 00:10:46.385
in degrees.
It can at least--The mental

00:10:46.385 --> 00:10:52.332
aspects can come in degrees.
We can have varying degrees of

00:10:52.332 --> 00:10:56.937
intelligence,
varying degrees of creativity,

00:10:56.937 --> 00:11:00.899
varying degrees of
reasonableness,

00:11:00.899 --> 00:11:04.850
varying degrees of ability to
communicate.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:11.105
So just as, we might say,
just as the functioning of the

00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:16.223
harp can come in varying
degrees--more or less

00:11:16.223 --> 00:11:23.047
harmony--the functioning of the
body in terms of its mind can

00:11:23.047 --> 00:11:28.067
come in varying degrees.
So that second objection

00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:30.480
doesn't seem to me very
compelling.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:35.206
Third objection,
Plato points out--Socrates

00:11:35.206 --> 00:11:41.621
points out--that the soul can be
good or it could be evil,

00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:45.165
wicked.
When the soul is good,

00:11:45.165 --> 00:11:51.140
when you've got somebody who
has got their stuff together,

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:56.799
we might speak of them as
having a harmonious soul.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:12:00.906
If the soul were to the body
like harmony is to the

00:12:00.906 --> 00:12:04.519
instrument and the soul can be
harmonious,

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:08.910
it would seem as though we'd
have to be able to talk about

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:12.158
harmony being harmonious.
So just as we can talk about

00:12:12.158 --> 00:12:14.452
the harmony of the soul,
we'd have to be able to--if the

00:12:14.452 --> 00:12:16.956
soul is like the harmony of the
body--we'd have to be able to

00:12:16.956 --> 00:12:18.750
talk about the harmony of the
harmony.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:24.169
But we don't talk about harmony
of the harmony.

00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:25.830
I'm not quite sure what to make
of this objection.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.746
This might be a point where it
would be well to remind

00:12:28.746 --> 00:12:31.993
ourselves of the fact that the
suggestion was never that the

00:12:31.993 --> 00:12:35.971
soul just literally is harmony.
It's just similar to harmony,

00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:39.438
says the physicalist,
in the way that harmony gets

00:12:39.438 --> 00:12:42.480
produced by the body--by the
instrument.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.782
In that same way,
mind or mental activity gets

00:12:45.782 --> 00:12:48.903
produced by the body.
We don't have to say that

00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:52.115
everything that's true of the
mind is true of harmony and

00:12:52.115 --> 00:12:55.327
everything that's true of
harmony is true of the body--or

00:12:55.327 --> 00:12:58.941
the mind.
Still, I think there's a bit

00:12:58.941 --> 00:13:03.460
more we can say in response to
this objection,

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:07.978
and that's this:
Just as it's true that we can

00:13:07.978 --> 00:13:13.200
talk about minds or souls being
good or wicked,

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:18.090
we can talk about different
kinds of harmony.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:23.210
There are--Certain harmonies
are sweeter than others;

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.590
some of them are more jarring
and atonal or discordant.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:35.944
Although we might not normally
talk about how harmonious the

00:13:35.944 --> 00:13:40.693
harmony is, it seems as though
harmonies can come in different

00:13:40.693 --> 00:13:44.443
sorts and different kinds.
And then, it turns out we

00:13:44.443 --> 00:13:47.724
really would have an analogy to
the mind, which can come in

00:13:47.724 --> 00:13:49.929
different sorts and different
kinds.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:54.700
So I think this third objection
isn't really compelling either.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.649
Finally, Plato raises one more
objection.

00:13:58.649 --> 00:14:02.726
He says, "Look,
the soul is capable of

00:14:02.726 --> 00:14:06.802
directing the body,
bossing it around,

00:14:06.802 --> 00:14:11.759
and indeed capable of opposing
the body."

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:14.908
You know, your body might want
that piece of chocolate cake,

00:14:14.908 --> 00:14:16.510
but your soul says,
"No, no.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:17.680
You're on a diet.
Don't eat it."

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:23.539
Right?
Your soul can oppose the body.

00:14:23.539 --> 00:14:30.179
But if the soul was just
harmony of the body,

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:37.439
how could it do that?
After all, the harmoniousness

00:14:37.439 --> 00:14:43.320
of the harp can't affect what
the harp does.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.769
All the causal interaction is
one way, as we might put it.

00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:53.195
In the case of the harp and the
musicality and the melodiousness

00:14:53.195 --> 00:14:56.986
and the harmony,
the physical state of the harp

00:14:56.986 --> 00:15:00.860
causes the melodiousness to be
the way it is.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:07.362
But the harmoniousness of the
harp, doesn't ever change or

00:15:07.362 --> 00:15:13.980
alter or direct the way the
physical object the harp is.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.481
In contrast,
not only can the body affect

00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:21.070
the soul, the soul can affect
the body.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:26.990
So that suggests it can't
really be like harmony and the

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.929
harp after all.
I think that's a pretty

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.967
interesting objection.
Since we do think,

00:15:31.967 --> 00:15:34.751
at least in the kind of
position that we've been taking

00:15:34.751 --> 00:15:37.851
for this class,
that the soul can affect the

00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:41.730
body, we might ask,
how could it be that it's--that

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.665
the physicalist view is right?
If talk about the mind is just

00:15:46.665 --> 00:15:51.019
a way of talking about what the
body can do, how can the

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:54.820
abilities of the body affect the
body itself?

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.395
I think the answer to this
objection is probably going to

00:16:04.395 --> 00:16:08.404
be something like,
what's really going on when we

00:16:08.404 --> 00:16:13.093
talk about the soul affecting
the body is that--when we say

00:16:13.093 --> 00:16:17.700
certain functions of the body
are affecting the body--that

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:22.226
certain mental functions are
affecting the body--how does

00:16:22.226 --> 00:16:26.592
this happen causally?
Well, something like the

00:16:26.592 --> 00:16:32.112
physical parts of the body that
underwrite, that lie beneath the

00:16:32.112 --> 00:16:36.423
proper functioning,
the proper mental functioning

00:16:36.423 --> 00:16:41.519
of body, those are able to alter
the other parts of the body.

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:47.179
So look, right now I'm telling
by body, "Wiggle my fingers."

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:50.190
My soul is giving instructions
to my body.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.281
How does that happen?
That's my mind giving

00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:55.279
instructions to my body.
How does that happen on the

00:16:55.279 --> 00:16:58.182
physicalist view?
Well, my mind giving

00:16:58.182 --> 00:17:02.347
instructions to my body,
"wiggle my fingers," is just

00:17:02.347 --> 00:17:07.621
one part of my body,
my brain, giving instructions

00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:14.130
to another part of my body,
the muscles in my fingers.

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:21.007
So, although we talk about the
mind altering the body,

00:17:21.007 --> 00:17:27.675
strictly what's going on there,
says the physicalist,

00:17:27.675 --> 00:17:34.151
is just one part of the body
affecting another part of the

00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:36.173
body.
Can we have something like that

00:17:36.173 --> 00:17:38.260
with a harp?
Well, maybe not.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.242
Right?
Maybe the harp's too simple a

00:17:41.242 --> 00:17:45.988
machine to have one part of it
affect another part of it in

00:17:45.988 --> 00:17:48.196
that way.
Even if that were true,

00:17:48.196 --> 00:17:51.023
that wouldn't give us reason to
reject the physicalist

00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:53.614
conception.
It would just give us reason to

00:17:53.614 --> 00:17:57.539
think the harp's not very
much like the mind and the body.

00:17:57.539 --> 00:18:01.168
It's just the beginnings of a
picture, of a physicalist

00:18:01.168 --> 00:18:04.397
picture.
Still, even if we think about

00:18:04.397 --> 00:18:08.983
the harp and musicality,
I think we can see something

00:18:08.983 --> 00:18:14.112
analogous.
Suppose I pluck a string on my

00:18:14.112 --> 00:18:21.534
harp, producing a certain note.
As we know, the vibrations of

00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:28.759
one string can set into play the
other strings vibrating as well.

00:18:28.759 --> 00:18:31.452
And so, suddenly,
what's happening in one part of

00:18:31.452 --> 00:18:34.930
the harp affects what's going on
in other parts of the harp.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:40.758
The musicality of my playing a
certain chord on the harp may

00:18:40.758 --> 00:18:45.500
create certain kinds of
overtones in the harp,

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.299
setting the harp vibrating in
various other ways.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:53.699
Well, that would be
analogous--perhaps not a precise

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:58.874
analogy, but at least a rough
analogy to what goes on when my

00:18:58.874 --> 00:19:04.136
mind affects my body--to--if one
part of my body affects other

00:19:04.136 --> 00:19:08.075
parts of my body.
So, on the one hand,

00:19:08.075 --> 00:19:13.453
I want to give Plato a fair bit
of credit for taking the

00:19:13.453 --> 00:19:19.319
physicalist view seriously
enough to try to criticize it.

00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:22.137
And since when he was writing
there weren't the kind of

00:19:22.137 --> 00:19:25.059
complicated thinking machines
that we've got nowadays,

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:28.414
it's no criticism of Plato that
he used simple machines like

00:19:28.414 --> 00:19:31.768
musical instruments to try to
think about what a physicalist

00:19:31.768 --> 00:19:35.087
picture would look like.
I want to give him credit,

00:19:35.087 --> 00:19:39.273
but I also want to suggest that
the objections that he raises to

00:19:39.273 --> 00:19:42.130
the physicalist view just don't
succeed.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.042
All right.
Now, there's one other argument

00:19:45.042 --> 00:19:47.730
that I want to consider in our
dialogue.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.184
And after the appeal to the
simplicity of the soul,

00:19:51.184 --> 00:19:54.776
there's a very long complicated
discussion about what

00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:57.539
constitutes an adequate
explanation,

00:19:57.539 --> 00:20:00.552
and Socrates gives some of his
history there and talks about

00:20:00.552 --> 00:20:03.768
what he's looking for in trying
to find adequate explanations of

00:20:03.768 --> 00:20:06.271
things.
And these passages are very,

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:10.293
very difficult and happily for
our purposes we don't really

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:13.048
need to go there.
Before the dialogue ends

00:20:13.048 --> 00:20:16.011
though, there's one further
argument, which I'll dub,

00:20:16.011 --> 00:20:18.520
"the argument from essential
properties."

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:27.177
Now again, it's important to
bear in mind as we try to make

00:20:27.177 --> 00:20:32.347
sense of this passage that Plato
is writing at a time when we

00:20:32.347 --> 00:20:34.925
don't have,
we didn't have,

00:20:34.925 --> 00:20:39.380
all the conceptual apparatus
that we have nowadays.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:45.025
We stand on his shoulders;
we've inherited some of the

00:20:45.025 --> 00:20:50.150
distinctions that he was the
first to try to put into play.

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.786
And so although,
again, he's about to--I'm about

00:20:52.786 --> 00:20:56.096
to sketch or reconstruct an
argument and claim that that the

00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:59.765
argument doesn't actually work,
this isn't really meant by way

00:20:59.765 --> 00:21:02.944
of being dismissive of Plato.
I want to give him a tremendous

00:21:02.944 --> 00:21:05.914
amount of credit.
He's trying to see his way

00:21:05.914 --> 00:21:11.200
through a morass of issues that
are still confusing to us today,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.849
though I think we can see
somewhat further than he was

00:21:13.849 --> 00:21:15.414
able to see.
At any rate,

00:21:15.414 --> 00:21:19.449
the distinction we need to
understand the final argument,

00:21:19.449 --> 00:21:23.268
is the distinction between an
essential property and a

00:21:23.268 --> 00:21:27.666
contingent property.
An essential property is a

00:21:27.666 --> 00:21:31.660
property that a given object
must have;

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.200
it always has as long as it
exists at all.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.213
A contingent property is a
property that an object may

00:21:39.213 --> 00:21:42.621
have, may happen to have its
entire existence,

00:21:42.621 --> 00:21:49.839
but could've existed without.
So my car is blue.

00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:52.990
That's a contingent property of
my car.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.490
I could take it to the paint
shop and get it painted red,

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:00.677
in which case it would be red.
It would no longer be blue,

00:22:00.677 --> 00:22:04.914
but the car would still exist.
My car is blue,

00:22:04.914 --> 00:22:10.529
but it could be red;
it could exist as a red car.

00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:13.659
And even if I never,
over the entire course of

00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:16.720
existence of my car,
never get it painted,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.545
so that from the moment it came
into creation to the moment it

00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:24.630
gets smashed it's always
blue--still,

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.853
we understand perfectly well
the idea that it could've been

00:22:28.853 --> 00:22:31.287
red.
There's nothing incompatible

00:22:31.287 --> 00:22:34.640
with the idea that this car
exists and is red.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.910
So that's an example of a
contingent property.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:43.509
And I might have a pencil,
and the pencil is whole.

00:22:43.509 --> 00:22:46.230
And I never break it,
but I could've broken it.

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:50.108
That's a contingent property,
whether the pencil is whole or

00:22:50.108 --> 00:22:52.200
broken.
I take a piece of metal;

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.550
it's a contingent property
whether it's straight or bent.

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.427
I bend it; now it's bent.
I might straighten it back out;

00:22:58.427 --> 00:23:01.450
now it's straight.
Many, many properties are

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:04.337
contingent properties.
You're happy,

00:23:04.337 --> 00:23:07.640
you're sad, you're awake,
you're asleep.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.991
But some properties,
in contrast,

00:23:10.991 --> 00:23:16.407
are essential properties.
For the particular thing that

00:23:16.407 --> 00:23:20.957
we're thinking about,
it's not possible to have that

00:23:20.957 --> 00:23:25.150
thing and not have the property
in question.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:31.210
Plato gives the example of fire
and being hot.

00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.346
Fire is hot.
That's a property that it's

00:23:35.346 --> 00:23:38.180
got, but it's not a contingent
property;

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:42.290
it's an essential property.
It's not as though some fire is

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:46.819
hot and some fire is cold or,
"Oh yes, it just happens that

00:23:46.819 --> 00:23:50.880
over the entire life of the fire
the fire is hot,

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:55.740
but we could have made it cold."
There's no such thing;

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.680
there could be no such thing as
cold fire.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:08.859
As long as you've got a bit of
fire, it's hot.

00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:13.221
Take away the heat,
you take away the fire,

00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:19.390
you destroy the fire.
You can't have cold fire.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:26.019
That's an example of an
essential property.

00:24:26.019 --> 00:24:28.622
That is to say,
Plato sees, as indeed I take it

00:24:28.622 --> 00:24:32.067
we all see at least roughly,
that there's some sort of

00:24:32.067 --> 00:24:35.422
distinction there,
and he's trying to see his way

00:24:35.422 --> 00:24:39.887
clear on these matters.
That remains a controversial

00:24:39.887 --> 00:24:44.732
question today--until today.
Are there really essential

00:24:44.732 --> 00:24:48.210
properties in the way we take
there to be?

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:51.460
If so, which properties are
essential?

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:56.743
Which ones are contingent?
Water is composed of

00:24:56.743 --> 00:25:00.150
H_2O--that's its
atomic structure.

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:02.130
Is that an essential property
of water?

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:06.464
Could you have something that
was water without being composed

00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:10.230
of H_2O--hydrogen and
oxygen in that way?

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.918
Well, some people say yes,
some people say no--but most of

00:25:12.918 --> 00:25:15.135
us we want to say,
"Oh, there's an example of an

00:25:15.135 --> 00:25:17.266
essential property.
To be water,

00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:20.580
you must have that atomic
structure."

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.740
All right.
That's the thought.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:27.471
Now, armed with this
distinction, Plato says,

00:25:27.471 --> 00:25:32.309
"Here's an essential property
for the soul.

00:25:32.309 --> 00:25:40.490
Wherever there's a soul,
it's alive."

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:46.254
Now, by "alive," I take it
Plato means it's thinking,

00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:52.106
or it's capable of thought.
Wherever you've got a soul,

00:25:52.106 --> 00:25:56.109
you've got something capable of
thought.

00:25:56.109 --> 00:26:00.163
I suppose one could try to
resist this claim of Plato's,

00:26:00.163 --> 00:26:02.890
but I find it reasonably
plausible.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:06.434
I start thinking about minds,
and I ask myself,

00:26:06.434 --> 00:26:10.750
"Could there be a mind that was
incapable of thought?"

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:14.769
Maybe not.
Maybe that's just built into

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:18.200
minds by definition.
Just like you couldn't have

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.809
something that was fire without
it being hot,

00:26:20.809 --> 00:26:24.307
you couldn't have something
that was a mind without it being

00:26:24.307 --> 00:26:26.630
capable of thought.
It's important to say the word

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:27.420
capable here.
Right?

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.140
It's not as though all minds
always are thinking.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.545
I presume there are stretches
during the night when my mind is

00:26:34.545 --> 00:26:36.640
not thinking,
not dreaming.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.788
Still, it's capable of thought
even thought it's not thinking

00:26:38.788 --> 00:26:39.290
at the time.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:45.020
But you say, "No.
Here's a mind that's not even

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.650
capable of thought."
I want to say,

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:48.831
"Then, it's just not a mind."
So all right,

00:26:48.831 --> 00:26:54.329
maybe being capable of thought
is an essential property of the

00:26:54.329 --> 00:26:56.638
mind.
Plato thinks about the mind in

00:26:56.638 --> 00:26:58.757
terms of souls,
so maybe being capable of

00:26:58.757 --> 00:27:01.299
thought is an essential property
of the soul.

00:27:01.299 --> 00:27:06.015
And I think that's what Plato
means when he suggests the mind

00:27:06.015 --> 00:27:09.630
is essential--the soul is
essentially alive.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:12.741
It's a necessary property,
as we might put it,

00:27:12.741 --> 00:27:14.678
of the soul,
that it's alive,

00:27:14.678 --> 00:27:17.851
that it's capable of thought.
So I want to say,

00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:22.670
"Not an implausible claim."
Let's give it to Socrates.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:27.881
But once we give it to
Socrates, Plato thinks now he's

00:27:27.881 --> 00:27:31.953
pretty much done.
After all, think about what it

00:27:31.953 --> 00:27:36.140
means to say that something's
got an essential property.

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.319
Fire's got the essential
property of being hot.

00:27:39.319 --> 00:27:41.680
It means there are only two
possibilities.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.054
Either you've got some fire and
it will be hot,

00:27:46.054 --> 00:27:51.000
or the fire has been destroyed,
it's been put out.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.269
Those are the only two
possibilities.

00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:56.271
You either have--If heat is an
essential property of fire,

00:27:56.271 --> 00:28:00.623
either you've got some fire and
it's hot, or the fire no longer

00:28:00.623 --> 00:28:06.553
exists, it's been put out.
There's no third possibility of

00:28:06.553 --> 00:28:10.500
a non-hot fire,
of a cold fire.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.289
So, if you've got the claim
that life's an essential

00:28:14.289 --> 00:28:17.558
property of the soul,
only two possibilities:

00:28:17.558 --> 00:28:21.569
either you've got the soul and
it's alive--to wit,

00:28:21.569 --> 00:28:30.910
it's capable of thought--or the
soul's been destroyed.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:36.950
But Plato thinks we can rule
out that other possibility.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:41.695
How?
Well, it's by thinking about

00:28:41.695 --> 00:28:45.289
this particular essential
property.

00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:49.304
There's nothing in the idea
that fire has the essential

00:28:49.304 --> 00:28:54.210
property of being hot to make us
think it couldn't be destroyed,

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.250
but there is something,
Plato thinks,

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:01.388
in the idea of being
essentially alive to rule out

00:29:01.388 --> 00:29:05.019
the possibility of its being
destroyed.

00:29:05.019 --> 00:29:09.585
In fact, as you say the very
words you begin to feel the

00:29:09.585 --> 00:29:12.740
force, the pull of Plato's
position.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:18.421
If the soul is essentially
alive, if it's necessarily

00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:23.390
alive, it's got to be alive.
It can't be destroyed.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.682
That's, I think,
at least the kind of argument

00:29:26.682 --> 00:29:33.390
that Plato means to put forward.
He does it in terms of the

00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:39.520
phrase, "deathless."
He says, I want to actually get

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:47.198
this up here on the board.
One--life is an essential

00:29:47.198 --> 00:29:51.870
property of the soul.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.106
But if you think about what
that means, it follows that the

00:30:03.106 --> 00:30:03.950
soul is deathless.

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:15.776
After all, if the soul is--If
it's essentially alive,

00:30:15.776 --> 00:30:21.549
that means it can't be dead.
So it's deathless.

00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:27.241
But after all,
anything that's deathless can't

00:30:27.241 --> 00:30:30.678
die.
So the soul cannot die,

00:30:30.678 --> 00:30:35.570
which is just to say it's
indestructible.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.950
So, soul can't be destroyed.

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:04.950
Something like this seems to be
Plato's argument.

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.641
One, life's an essential
property of the soul,

00:31:07.641 --> 00:31:11.529
but we can just summarize that
by saying the soul is deathless.

00:31:11.529 --> 00:31:15.559
But if the soul is deathless,
it can't die.

00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:18.156
If it can't die,
it can't be destroyed,

00:31:18.156 --> 00:31:24.259
it's indestructible.
So the soul can't be destroyed.

00:31:24.259 --> 00:31:26.977
Remember, once we said the soul
was alive, there were only two

00:31:26.977 --> 00:31:29.543
possibilities.
If the soul was essentially

00:31:29.543 --> 00:31:33.798
alive, either we have the soul,
it's alive, capable of thought,

00:31:33.798 --> 00:31:36.749
or it's destroyed.
But if the soul can't be

00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:40.586
destroyed, that leaves only the
possibility the soul is alive,

00:31:40.586 --> 00:31:43.079
capable of thought.
That's just what Plato thinks;

00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:48.190
the soul will always exist,
capable of thought.

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:52.250
Well, it won't shock you to
hear that I don't think this

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:56.744
argument actually works.
And I think where it goes wrong

00:31:56.744 --> 00:32:01.560
is there's a certain kind of
ambiguity in the idea of being

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.640
deathless.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:14.910
What does it mean to say that
something is deathless?

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:20.839
I think there are two possible
interpretations of that phrase.

00:32:20.839 --> 00:32:31.046
If something is deathless,
then it can't be that--well,

00:32:31.046 --> 00:32:33.659
what?
One possibility is,

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:36.780
it can't be that the soul
exists and is dead.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.710
That's one possible
interpretation.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.967
To say that something is
deathless means you'll never

00:32:54.967 --> 00:32:58.726
have a soul that exists and the
same time that it exists it's

00:32:58.726 --> 00:32:59.290
dead.

00:33:04.069 --> 00:33:12.640
But there's a second possible
interpretation of deathless.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:20.540
It can't be that the soul was
destroyed.

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:41.753
It's very easy to confuse these
two interpretations of

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:45.368
deathless, A and B.
And basically,

00:33:45.368 --> 00:33:47.420
this is what I think is going
on with Plato.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:52.543
He's running back and forth
between these two

00:33:52.543 --> 00:33:57.631
interpretations.
If life is an essential

00:33:57.631 --> 00:34:04.135
property of the soul,
then that means we will never

00:34:04.135 --> 00:34:10.248
have, as it were,
a soul in our hand that exists

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:14.378
and is dead.
Just in the same way that

00:34:14.378 --> 00:34:17.907
you'll never have a piece of
fire in your hand,

00:34:17.907 --> 00:34:20.900
as it were, that exists and is
cold.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:27.135
It can't happen.
Wherever you've got a soul,

00:34:27.135 --> 00:34:33.050
it is alive.
So it's deathless in sense

00:34:33.050 --> 00:34:38.800
number, in sense A.
Since wherever you've got a

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:43.892
soul it must be alive,
it couldn't be the case that

00:34:43.892 --> 00:34:50.090
the soul exists and is dead.
So it's deathless in sense A.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.294
But for all that,
it could still be,

00:34:53.294 --> 00:34:57.047
logically speaking,
that the soul could be

00:34:57.047 --> 00:35:01.349
destroyed, just like a fire can
be put out.

00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:05.840
We could imagine something that
couldn't be destroyed.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:11.037
Then of course it would be
deathless in sense B,

00:35:11.037 --> 00:35:15.130
a much stronger sense of
deathless.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.790
What Plato needs,
what Plato wants,

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:24.711
is to convince us that the soul
is deathless in sense B:

00:35:24.711 --> 00:35:31.710
It's true of the soul that it
can't be that it was destroyed.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:37.294
But all he's entitled to is
sense A: You'll never have a

00:35:37.294 --> 00:35:42.776
soul that exists and is dead,
because being alive is an

00:35:42.776 --> 00:35:48.018
essential property of the soul.
But the mere fact that where

00:35:48.018 --> 00:35:51.395
there's a soul it's alive,
doesn't mean the soul couldn't

00:35:51.395 --> 00:35:53.628
be destroyed.
Just like from the fact that

00:35:53.628 --> 00:35:56.211
where there's fire it's hot
doesn't mean the fire can't be

00:35:56.211 --> 00:35:56.800
destroyed.

00:36:02.869 --> 00:36:08.506
It's, I think,
pretty easy to get confused in

00:36:08.506 --> 00:36:15.483
thinking about these issues.
It's difficult to see your way

00:36:15.483 --> 00:36:21.019
clearly to these two different
notions of deathless.

00:36:21.019 --> 00:36:25.806
It's difficult to get to the
point where you can clearly use

00:36:25.806 --> 00:36:29.943
the language of essential
properties without getting

00:36:29.943 --> 00:36:33.753
screwed up.
Still, I think that's what

00:36:33.753 --> 00:36:38.349
happened here.
We grant Plato the thought that

00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:43.449
the soul has an essential
property of being alive;

00:36:43.449 --> 00:36:48.278
from this, it follows that
where there's a soul it is

00:36:48.278 --> 00:36:52.550
alive, and hence,
it's deathless in sense A.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.443
But once we start thinking
about the category,

00:36:54.443 --> 00:36:58.657
the notion of being deathless,
we're tempted to re-understand

00:36:58.657 --> 00:37:04.010
that as being deathless in sense
B, can't be destroyed.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:06.810
And that, I think,
doesn't follow.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:11.599
All right.
Where does that leave us?

00:37:11.599 --> 00:37:15.392
Plato's gone through a series
of arguments for the

00:37:15.392 --> 00:37:18.952
immortality, the
indestructibility of the soul,

00:37:18.952 --> 00:37:22.280
and I've argued that none of
them work.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.760
Some of them are worth taking
seriously.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.889
That's why we've spent the last
week or so going over them.

00:37:27.889 --> 00:37:30.897
But none of them,
as far as I can see,

00:37:30.897 --> 00:37:34.403
are successful.
And I hardly need remind you

00:37:34.403 --> 00:37:39.105
that this comes on the heels of
a previous week or two in which

00:37:39.105 --> 00:37:43.732
we talked about various other
arguments for the very existence

00:37:43.732 --> 00:37:48.496
of an immaterial soul.
And I've argued that none of

00:37:48.496 --> 00:37:53.118
those arguments work either.
As far as I can see then,

00:37:53.118 --> 00:37:57.315
the arguments that might be
offered for the existence of an

00:37:57.315 --> 00:38:01.322
immaterial soul,
let alone an immortal soul,

00:38:01.322 --> 00:38:05.759
the arguments don't succeed.
It's not that the idea of a

00:38:05.759 --> 00:38:09.079
soul is in any way silly;
it's not that it's not worth

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:11.575
thinking about.
It's that when we ask

00:38:11.575 --> 00:38:15.395
ourselves, "Do we have any good
reason to believe in an

00:38:15.395 --> 00:38:19.005
immaterial soul?"
and actually try to spell out

00:38:19.005 --> 00:38:23.243
what those reasons might be,
as we look more carefully we

00:38:23.243 --> 00:38:26.650
see the arguments are not very
compelling.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:32.570
So I'm prepared to conclude
there is no soul.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:36.250
There's no good reason to
believe in souls.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:41.370
And I so I conclude--at least
there's no good enough reason to

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:45.820
believe in souls--and so I
conclude there are none.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.486
And this is the position that
here on out I'm going to be

00:38:50.486 --> 00:38:53.570
assuming for the rest of the
class.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:57.137
I'm going to have us continue
to think about death,

00:38:57.137 --> 00:39:01.489
but now think about death from
the physicalist perspective.

00:39:01.489 --> 00:39:05.656
Given the assumption that the
body is all there is,

00:39:05.656 --> 00:39:10.489
that talk about the mind is
just a way of talking about the

00:39:10.489 --> 00:39:14.573
abilities of the body to do
certain special mental

00:39:14.573 --> 00:39:19.196
activities.
There are no extra things

00:39:19.196 --> 00:39:24.070
beyond the body,
no immaterial souls.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:28.344
Now, it wouldn't be
unreasonable at this point to

00:39:28.344 --> 00:39:31.550
accuse me of begging the
question.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.150
After all, think about what
I've done.

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:41.949
I've put all of the burden of
proof on the fan of souls.

00:39:41.949 --> 00:39:46.498
I've asked the dualist,
"Give me some reason to believe

00:39:46.498 --> 00:39:50.505
your position."
And I've said the arguments on

00:39:50.505 --> 00:39:54.110
behalf of dualism aren't very
convincing.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.402
Don't I now need,
in fairness,

00:39:55.402 --> 00:39:57.320
to do the same thing for the
physicalist?

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.913
Don't I need to turn to the
physicalist and say,

00:39:59.913 --> 00:40:03.170
"Give me some reason to believe
that physicalism is true?

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:08.539
Give me some reason to believe
souls don't exist."

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:11.337
After all, I turned to the
dualist and said,

00:40:11.337 --> 00:40:14.200
"Give me some reason to believe
in souls."

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.763
Those arguments didn't work.
Don't I now need to turn to the

00:40:17.763 --> 00:40:21.124
physicalist and say,
"Give me some reason not

00:40:21.124 --> 00:40:25.218
to believe in souls?
Prove that souls don't

00:40:25.218 --> 00:40:29.829
exist."
Isn't that fair?

00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:36.932
So let's pause and ask
ourselves, how do you go about

00:40:36.932 --> 00:40:42.260
proving that something doesn't
exist?

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:49.445
Or, to put it in a slightly
better way, when do you need to

00:40:49.445 --> 00:40:54.030
prove that something doesn't
exist?

00:40:54.030 --> 00:41:00.457
When we have examples of things
whose existence we don't believe

00:41:00.457 --> 00:41:07.090
in, how do we decide when we're
justified in disbelieving them?

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:12.774
Take something like dragons.
Let me assume that everybody in

00:41:12.774 --> 00:41:15.971
this class, in this room,
does not believe in the

00:41:15.971 --> 00:41:17.570
existence of dragons.

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:29.370
How do I prove that there
aren't any dragons?

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:33.680
I mean, there could be dragons.
Couldn't there?

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:38.030
But there aren't any.
We don't believe in dragons.

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:41.710
So don't you need to disprove
the existence of dragons before

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.900
you continue on your way of not
believing in them?

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:57.710
I imagine nobody in this room
believes in the existence of

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:03.817
Zeus, the Greek god.
How do you disprove the

00:42:03.817 --> 00:42:09.191
existence of Zeus?
Don't we have an obligation to

00:42:09.191 --> 00:42:15.789
prove that Zeus doesn't exist?
But how could you do that?

00:42:15.789 --> 00:42:20.753
Well, unsurprisingly,
I don't actually think you do

00:42:20.753 --> 00:42:25.320
have an obligation to disprove
those things.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.789
That doesn't mean you don't
have any obligations.

00:42:27.789 --> 00:42:31.010
You just have to be very
careful about what the

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.460
intellectual obligations come
to.

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:36.586
So back to dragons.
What do we need to do for

00:42:36.586 --> 00:42:40.378
dragons?
Well, the most important thing

00:42:40.378 --> 00:42:44.613
you need to do,
to justify your skepticism

00:42:44.613 --> 00:42:49.022
about dragons,
is to refute all of the

00:42:49.022 --> 00:42:55.250
arguments that might be offered
on behalf of dragons.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:43:01.198
My son's got a book about
dragons with some very nice

00:43:01.198 --> 00:43:06.123
photographs.
So, one of the things I need to

00:43:06.123 --> 00:43:11.697
do in order to justify my
skepticism about dragons is

00:43:11.697 --> 00:43:16.521
explain away the photographs,
or the drawings,

00:43:16.521 --> 00:43:21.230
or what have you.
I need to explain why it is

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:25.844
that we have pictures,
even though there really aren't

00:43:25.844 --> 00:43:28.440
any dragons.
Well, some of these are just

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.838
drawings, and people were
drawing things out of their

00:43:30.838 --> 00:43:32.702
imagination.
The things that look like

00:43:32.702 --> 00:43:35.329
photographs, nowadays with
computer generated graphics,

00:43:35.329 --> 00:43:38.414
you can make things that look
like photographs,

00:43:38.414 --> 00:43:41.967
and given Photoshop you can
make things that look like

00:43:41.967 --> 00:43:45.989
pictures of just about anything
that doesn't even exist.

00:43:45.989 --> 00:43:51.099
How do I prove there aren't any
unicorns?

00:43:51.099 --> 00:43:55.336
Well, I look at the various
reported sightings of unicorns

00:43:55.336 --> 00:43:58.643
and I try to explain them away,
"Well, you know,

00:43:58.643 --> 00:44:01.789
it's the first time people,
Europeans, saw the rhinoceros.

00:44:01.789 --> 00:44:05.500
It sort of reminded them of a
horse with a big horn.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:08.751
And maybe that's where the
reports of rhinoceros came--or

00:44:08.751 --> 00:44:11.480
the various reports of the
unicorn came from.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:16.521
The various unicorn horns that
have been offered in various

00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:21.475
collections, upon examination by
biologists turn out to be

00:44:21.475 --> 00:44:24.057
narwhal horns,
horns from whales,

00:44:24.057 --> 00:44:27.615
and so forth and so on."
You look at each bit of

00:44:27.615 --> 00:44:33.027
evidence that gets offered on
behalf of the unicorn and you

00:44:33.027 --> 00:44:37.566
debunk it.
You explain why it's not

00:44:37.566 --> 00:44:40.788
compelling.
And when you're done,

00:44:40.788 --> 00:44:44.423
you're entitled to say,
"You know, as far as I can

00:44:44.423 --> 00:44:48.743
tell, there aren't any unicorns.
As far as I can tell,

00:44:48.743 --> 00:44:53.267
there aren't any dragons."
It's not as though you've got

00:44:53.267 --> 00:44:57.963
some obligation to look in every
single cave anywhere on the

00:44:57.963 --> 00:45:01.527
surface of the Earth and say,
"Oh, no dragons in there,

00:45:01.527 --> 00:45:03.154
no dragons in there,
no dragons in there,

00:45:03.154 --> 00:45:05.400
no dragons in there,
no dragons in there."

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.503
You are pretty much justified
in being skeptical about the

00:45:10.503 --> 00:45:15.875
existence of dragons once you've
undermined the arguments for

00:45:15.875 --> 00:45:18.635
dragons.
Now, there might be something

00:45:18.635 --> 00:45:22.583
more that you could do.
In at least some cases,

00:45:22.583 --> 00:45:29.467
you can go on to argue the very
idea of the kind of thing we're

00:45:29.467 --> 00:45:34.355
talking about is impossible.
It's not just--Take dragons

00:45:34.355 --> 00:45:38.395
again;
it's not just that there's no

00:45:38.395 --> 00:45:42.820
good reason to believe in
dragons.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:47.801
The very idea of a dragon may
be scientifically incoherent,

00:45:47.801 --> 00:45:52.010
at least given the science as
we understand it.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:54.179
I mean, dragons are supposed to
breath fire.

00:45:54.179 --> 00:45:56.429
So that must mean they've got
fire in their belly.

00:45:56.429 --> 00:46:00.435
But how does the fire continue
to exist in their belly,

00:46:00.435 --> 00:46:03.807
absent--lack of oxygen?
Why isn't the fire in their

00:46:03.807 --> 00:46:06.560
belly busy burning and
destroying the membranes of

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:09.541
their stomach or whatever?
All right, you could,

00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:13.079
I suppose, try to prove that
dragons were scientifically

00:46:13.079 --> 00:46:13.980
impossible.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:21.180
And if you could,
then you'd have an extra reason

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.805
to not believe in them.
But it's not as though you have

00:46:25.805 --> 00:46:30.605
to prove that something's
impossible to be justified in

00:46:30.605 --> 00:46:35.215
not believing in it.
I don't think unicorns are

00:46:35.215 --> 00:46:38.767
impossible.
I just don't think there are

00:46:38.767 --> 00:46:41.295
any.
Surely, there could be horses

00:46:41.295 --> 00:46:45.290
with a single long horn growing
out of their forehead.

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:52.926
There just aren't any.
So armed with these ideas,

00:46:52.926 --> 00:46:56.050
come back to the discussion of
souls.

00:46:56.050 --> 00:47:00.087
Do I, as a physicalist who does
not believe in the existence of

00:47:00.087 --> 00:47:03.670
souls, immaterial entities above
and beyond the body,

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.750
do I need to disprove the
existence of souls?

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:09.830
"Well, there's no soul here,
no souls there."

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:15.216
No.
What I need to do is to take a

00:47:15.216 --> 00:47:22.022
look at each argument that gets
offered for the existence of a

00:47:22.022 --> 00:47:27.934
soul and rebut it--explain why
those arguments are not

00:47:27.934 --> 00:47:32.114
compelling.
I don't need to prove that

00:47:32.114 --> 00:47:38.505
souls are impossible.
I just need to undermine the

00:47:38.505 --> 00:47:43.461
case for souls.
If there's no good reason to

00:47:43.461 --> 00:47:47.328
believe in souls,
that actually constitutes a

00:47:47.328 --> 00:47:51.460
reason to believe there
are no souls.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:55.773
Now, if you want to,
you could go on and try to

00:47:55.773 --> 00:48:01.118
prove that souls are impossible
in the same way that maybe

00:48:01.118 --> 00:48:03.650
dragons are impossible.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:11.679
But I'm not sure that I myself
find such impossibility claims

00:48:11.679 --> 00:48:15.153
especially persuasive.
I don't believe in the

00:48:15.153 --> 00:48:19.199
existence of souls,
but that doesn't mean that I

00:48:19.199 --> 00:48:24.880
find the idea of an immaterial
entity like the soul impossible.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.922
Now, some people might say,
"Well, you know,

00:48:27.922 --> 00:48:30.469
it violates science as we know
it.

00:48:30.469 --> 00:48:35.099
It violates physics to have
there be something immaterial."

00:48:35.099 --> 00:48:39.720
But science is constantly
coming around to believe in

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:45.230
entities or properties that it
didn't believe in previously.

00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:50.558
Maybe it just hasn't gotten
around to believing in souls

00:48:50.558 --> 00:48:53.601
yet.
Or if current science rules out

00:48:53.601 --> 00:48:57.175
the possibility of souls,
maybe we should say,

00:48:57.175 --> 00:49:00.590
"So much the worse for current
science."

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:06.075
So I'm not somebody who wants
to say we can disprove the

00:49:06.075 --> 00:49:10.274
existence of souls.
I don't think we can disprove

00:49:10.274 --> 00:49:12.800
them.
I don't think the idea of a

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:16.454
soul is in any way incoherent.
There are philosophers who've

00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:19.949
thought that.
I'm not one of them.

00:49:19.949 --> 00:49:24.705
But I don't think I need to
disprove the existence of a soul

00:49:24.705 --> 00:49:28.010
to be justified in not believing
in it.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:31.727
Unicorns aren't impossible,
but for all that,

00:49:31.727 --> 00:49:35.530
I'm justified in thinking there
aren't any.

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:39.298
Why?
Because all the evidence for

00:49:39.298 --> 00:49:44.539
unicorns just doesn't add up to
very convincing case.

00:49:44.539 --> 00:49:48.481
Souls are not impossible,
but for all that,

00:49:48.481 --> 00:49:53.550
I think I'm justified in
believing there aren't any.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.832
Why?
Because when you look for

00:49:55.832 --> 00:49:58.971
the--look at the arguments that
have been offered to try to

00:49:58.971 --> 00:50:01.190
convince us of the existence of
souls,

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:04.825
those arguments just aren't
very compelling,

00:50:04.825 --> 00:50:09.105
or so it seems to me.
So, from this point on out,

00:50:09.105 --> 00:50:13.429
I'll be assuming the
physicalist view is correct,

00:50:13.429 --> 00:50:17.024
and will be thinking about the
issues of death as they'd be

00:50:17.024 --> 00:50:20.000
understood from the physicalist
point of view.

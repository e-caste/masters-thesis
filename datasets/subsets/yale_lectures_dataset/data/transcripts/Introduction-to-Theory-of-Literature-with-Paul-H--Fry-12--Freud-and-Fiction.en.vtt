00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.985
Prof: Well,
now today is obviously a kind

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:06.730
of watershed or transition in
our syllabus.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.600
You remember we began with an
emphasis on language.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.938
We then promised to move to an
emphasis on psychological

00:00:16.938 --> 00:00:21.276
matters, and finally social and
cultural determinants of

00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:22.460
literature.
 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.455
So far we have immersed
ourselves in notions to the

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:33.950
effect that thought and speech
are constituted by language or,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.767
to put it another way,
brought into being by language

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:46.816
and that thought and speech have
to be understood as inseparable

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:53.704
from their linguistic milieu--
language here being understood

00:00:53.704 --> 00:00:59.360
sometimes broadly as a structure
or a semiotic system.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.350
Now obviously our transition
from language-determined ideas

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.840
about speech,
discourse, and literature to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.513
psychologically determined ways
of thinking about discourse and

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:22.185
literature has a rather smooth
road to follow because the first

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:27.033
two authors who borrow from
Freud and understand their

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:31.241
project to a degree in
psychoanalytic terms are

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:36.547
nevertheless using what is now
for us an extremely familiar

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:38.560
vocabulary.
 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.032
That is to say,
they really do suppose that the

00:01:43.032 --> 00:01:47.700
medium of consciousness to which
we now turn--

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.674
the psyche, the relationship
between consciousness and the

00:01:51.674 --> 00:01:54.952
unconscious--
they really do suppose that

00:01:54.952 --> 00:01:57.842
this entity,
whatever it may be,

00:01:57.842 --> 00:02:03.221
can be understood in terms that
we take usefully from verbal

00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:06.140
thought and from linguistics.
 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.280
Lacan famously said,
as you'll find next week,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.397
"The unconscious is
structured like a

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:17.050
language,"
and Brooks plainly does agree.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.913
You open Brooks and you find
yourself really apart perhaps--I

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:26.938
don't know how well all of you
are acquainted with the texts of

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:27.750
Freud.
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.222
We'll say a little bit about
Beyond the Pleasure

00:02:30.222 --> 00:02:33.190
Principle, which is the
crucial text for our purposes;

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.224
but plainly apart from the
influence of and the ideas

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:41.027
borrowed from Freud,
you'll find Brooks writing on

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:44.210
what for you is pretty familiar
turf.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.404
For example,
he begins by borrowing the

00:02:47.404 --> 00:02:52.616
Russian formalist distinction in
trying to explain what fiction

00:02:52.616 --> 00:02:55.139
is between plot and story.
 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:59.104
I feel that I do ultimately
have to cave in and admit to you

00:02:59.104 --> 00:03:02.128
that the Russian words for these
concepts,

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:05.603
plot and story,
are syuzhet and

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:09.695
fabula respectively,
because Brooks keeps using

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:11.120
these terms again and again.
 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.694
I've explained my embarrassment
about using terms that I really

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:19.460
have no absolutely no idea
&gt;

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.298
of the meaning of except that
I'm told what the meaning of

00:03:22.298 --> 00:03:25.135
them is in the books that I am
reading, which are the same

00:03:25.135 --> 00:03:26.628
books that you're reading.
 

00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:28.300
In &gt;
 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.912
any case, since Brooks does
constantly use these terms,

00:03:31.912 --> 00:03:35.054
I have to overcome
embarrassment and at least at

00:03:35.054 --> 00:03:36.860
times use them myself.
 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.780
They're a little
counterintuitive,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.098
by the way, if you try to find
cognates for them in English

00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:44.788
because you'd think that
syuzhet would be

00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:47.991
"subject matter,"
in other words something much

00:03:47.991 --> 00:03:50.681
closer to what the formalists
mean in English by

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.169
"story."
 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.297
On the other hand,
you'd think that fabula

00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:56.617
might well be something like
"plot"

00:03:56.617 --> 00:03:58.650
or "fiction,"
but it is not.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:59.930
It's just the opposite.
 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.764
Syuzhet is the plot,
the way in which a story is

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:08.439
constructed,
and the fabula is the

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:16.177
subject matter or material out
of which the syuzhet is

00:04:16.177 --> 00:04:17.209
made.
 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.125
All right.
 

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:23.442
In addition to the use of the
relationship between plot and

00:04:23.442 --> 00:04:26.961
story,
we also find Brooks using terms

00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:29.976
that are now,
having read Jakobson and de

00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:33.557
Man, very familiar to us:
the terms "metaphor"

00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:35.379
and "metonymy."
 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.666
There's plainly a tendency in
modern literary theory to reduce

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:43.389
all the tropes of rhetoric to
just these two terms.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.819
When needed,
they back up a little bit and

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.776
invoke other terms,
but the basic distinction in

00:04:50.776 --> 00:04:53.305
rhetoric,
as literary theory tends to

00:04:53.305 --> 00:04:55.791
understand it,
is the distinction between

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:57.865
metaphor--
which unifies,

00:04:57.865 --> 00:05:01.480
synthesizes,
and brings together--

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.401
and metonymy,
which puts one thing next to

00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:10.564
another by a recognizable
gesture toward contiguity but

00:05:10.564 --> 00:05:16.685
which nevertheless does not make
any claim or pretension to unify

00:05:16.685 --> 00:05:21.338
or establish identity--
to insist, in short,

00:05:21.338 --> 00:05:22.560
that A is B.
 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.288
These two terms,
as I say, are understood

00:05:26.288 --> 00:05:32.067
reductively but usefully to be
the essential topics of rhetoric

00:05:32.067 --> 00:05:36.730
and appropriated by modern
theory in that way.

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.083
Now Brooks then uses these
terms in ways that should be

00:05:41.083 --> 00:05:43.259
familiar to us,
as I say.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:49.665
We have now been amply exposed
to them in reading Jakobson and

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:50.610
de Man.
 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.610
So there is a language of
language in Brooks' essay,

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.733
"Freud's Masterplot,"
despite the fact that the

00:06:00.733 --> 00:06:05.005
framework for his argument is
psychoanalytic and that he is

00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:09.572
drawing primarily on the text of
Freud's Beyond the Pleasure

00:06:09.572 --> 00:06:13.050
Principle.
So what does he take from Freud?

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.800
What interests Brooks about
Freud?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.250
He is, by the way,
a distinguished Freudian

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.870
scholar who knows everything
about Freud and is interested,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.790
in fact, by every aspect of
Freud, but for the purpose of

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.920
constructing the argument here
and in the book to which this

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.115
essay belongs,
the book called Reading for

00:06:33.115 --> 00:06:35.596
the Plot--
for the purposes of

00:06:35.596 --> 00:06:40.372
constructing that argument,
what he takes in particular

00:06:40.372 --> 00:06:45.110
from Freud is the idea of
structure: the idea that,

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.949
insofar as we can imagine Freud
anticipating Lacan--

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:52.154
Lacan himself certainly
believed that Freud anticipated

00:06:52.154 --> 00:06:54.879
him--
the idea that the unconscious

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.350
is structured like a language.
 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.060
In terms of creating fictional
plots, in terms of the nature of

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.752
fiction, which is what interests
Brooks--well,

00:07:03.752 --> 00:07:05.189
what does this mean?
 

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:09.201
Aristotle tells us that a plot
has a beginning,

00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:11.120
a middle and an end.
 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.980
"Duh!"
 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.252
of course, is our response,
and yet at the same time we

00:07:16.252 --> 00:07:20.682
can't understand a degree of
mystery in even so seemingly

00:07:20.682 --> 00:07:22.819
simple a pronouncement.
 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:24.809
A beginning,
of course--well,

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:26.870
it has to have a beginning.
 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.839
We assume that unless we're
dealing with Scheherazade,

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:33.074
it has to have an end,
but at the same time we might

00:07:33.074 --> 00:07:35.810
well ask ourselves,
why does it have a middle?

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.779
What is the function of the
middle with respect to a

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:41.569
beginning and an end?
 

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:45.529
Why does Aristotle say,
as Brooks quotes him,

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:49.670
that a plot should have a
certain magnitude?

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.740
Why shouldn't it be shorter?
 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.779
Why shouldn't it be longer?
 

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:56.154
In other words,
what is the relation of these

00:07:56.154 --> 00:07:58.995
parts,
and what in particular does the

00:07:58.995 --> 00:08:02.872
middle have to do with revealing
to us the necessary

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:07.052
connectedness of the beginning
and the end: not just any

00:08:07.052 --> 00:08:11.307
beginning or any end but a
beginning which precipitates a

00:08:11.307 --> 00:08:15.184
kind of logic,
and an end which in some way,

00:08:15.184 --> 00:08:17.769
whether tragically or
comically,

00:08:17.769 --> 00:08:21.350
satisfactorily resolves that
logic?

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.879
How does all this work?
 

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:26.855
Brooks believes that he can
understand it,

00:08:26.855 --> 00:08:31.800
as we'll try to explain,
in psychoanalytic terms.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.779
So this he gets from Freud,
and he also gets,

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:41.037
as I've already suggested,
the methodological idea that

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:45.057
one can think of the
machinations of a text in terms

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:48.288
of the distinction that Freud
makes--

00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:51.740
not in Beyond the Pleasure
Principle, but in

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.068
The Interpretation of
Dreams in the passages that

00:08:55.068 --> 00:08:58.580
you read for today's assignment
taken from that book,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.735
The Interpretation of
Dreams, about the dream

00:09:01.735 --> 00:09:02.168
work.
 

00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:07.330
It's there that Freud argues
that really the central two

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:13.428
mechanisms of the dream work are
condensation and displacement.

00:09:13.428 --> 00:09:18.697
Condensation takes the
essential symbols of the dream

00:09:18.697 --> 00:09:25.181
and distills them into a kind of
over-determined unity so that if

00:09:25.181 --> 00:09:31.259
one studies the dream work one
can see the underlying wish or

00:09:31.259 --> 00:09:36.629
desire expressed in the dream
manifest in a particular

00:09:36.629 --> 00:09:38.960
symbolic unity.
 

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.703
That's the way in which the
dream condenses,

00:09:41.703 --> 00:09:45.152
but at the same time the dream
is doing something very,

00:09:45.152 --> 00:09:48.279
very different,
and it's called displacement.

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:51.808
There the essential symbols of
the dream--

00:09:51.808 --> 00:09:54.865
that is to say,
the way in which the dream is

00:09:54.865 --> 00:09:58.200
attempting to manifest that
which it desires,

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.561
are not expressed in
themselves, but are rather

00:10:02.561 --> 00:10:07.397
displaced on to sometimes
obscurely related ideas or

00:10:07.397 --> 00:10:12.583
symbols,
images, or activities that the

00:10:12.583 --> 00:10:16.678
interpreter,
that the person trying to

00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:20.456
decode the dream,
needs to arrive at and to

00:10:20.456 --> 00:10:21.450
understand.
 

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.096
So displacement is a kind of
delay or detour of

00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:27.556
understanding,
and condensation,

00:10:27.556 --> 00:10:31.202
on the other hand,
is a kind of distillation of

00:10:31.202 --> 00:10:32.788
understanding.
 

00:10:32.788 --> 00:10:38.095
The extraordinary thing that
Freud remarks on as he studies

00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:41.500
dreams in this book--
published in 1905,

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.620
by the way--the extraordinary
thing about the way in which

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.029
dreams work is that there seems
to be a kind of coexistence or

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:52.558
simultaneity of these effects.
 

00:10:52.558 --> 00:10:58.351
The dream work simultaneously
condenses and displaces that

00:10:58.351 --> 00:11:04.448
which it is somehow or another
struggling to make manifest as

00:11:04.448 --> 00:11:06.990
its object of desire.
 

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.860
Now the first person to notice
that there might be--

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:16.488
there are a variety of people
who noticed that there might be

00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:20.268
a connection between
condensation and displacement

00:11:20.268 --> 00:11:26.203
and metaphor and metonymy,
most notably Jacques Lacan whom

00:11:26.203 --> 00:11:32.379
Brooks quotes to this effect:
that the work in everyday

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:36.172
discourse,
in what we say but also in our

00:11:36.172 --> 00:11:39.168
dreams and in what we tell our
analyst,

00:11:39.168 --> 00:11:45.470
can be understood as operating
through the medium of these two

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.399
tropes.
 

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:49.368
Condensation,
in other words,

00:11:49.368 --> 00:11:55.620
is metaphorical in its nature,
and displacement is metonymic

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.529
in its nature.
 

00:11:57.529 --> 00:12:03.054
Metonymy is the delay or
perpetual, as we gathered also

00:12:03.054 --> 00:12:07.148
from Derrida,
différance of

00:12:07.148 --> 00:12:08.990
signification.
 

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:15.652
Metaphor is the bringing
together in a statement of

00:12:15.652 --> 00:12:24.580
identity of the discourse that's
attempting to articulate itself.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:29.720
Again we see in fiction,
as Brooks argues in his essay,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:34.129
that these two rhetorical
tendencies,

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:38.308
the metaphorical and metonymic,
coexist--

00:12:38.308 --> 00:12:42.494
and of course you can hear the
implicit critique of de Man in

00:12:42.494 --> 00:12:45.476
the background--
and may or may not work in

00:12:45.476 --> 00:12:48.011
harmony,
may or may not conduce to an

00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:51.934
ultimate unity,
but nevertheless do coexist in

00:12:51.934 --> 00:12:56.761
such a way that we can
understand the unraveling of a

00:12:56.761 --> 00:13:01.961
fictional narrative as being
like the processes we see at

00:13:01.961 --> 00:13:05.490
work in the unraveling of
dreams.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:10.639
So it's these two elements that
Brooks is interested in in Freud

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:14.320
and that he primarily does take
from Freud.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.970
Now this means,
among other things,

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:21.347
that Brooks is not anything
like what we may spontaneously

00:13:21.347 --> 00:13:25.971
caricature perhaps as a
traditional psychoanalytic

00:13:25.971 --> 00:13:27.009
critic.
 

00:13:27.009 --> 00:13:30.210
Brooks is not going around
looking for Oedipus complexes

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.490
and phallic symbols.
 

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:36.019
Brooks is, as I hope you can
see, interested in very

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:39.750
different aspects of the
Freudian text,

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:45.032
and he says as much at the end
of essay on page 1171 in the

00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:49.681
right-hand column where he says:
â€¦ [T]here can be

00:13:49.681 --> 00:13:53.682
psychoanalytic criticism of the
text itself that does not become

00:13:53.682 --> 00:13:56.860
["This is what I'm
doing," he says]--

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:02.096
as has usually been the case--a
study of the psychogenesis of

00:14:02.096 --> 00:14:05.500
the text (the author's
unconscious),

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.417
the dynamics of literary
response (the reader's

00:14:09.417 --> 00:14:13.365
unconscious),
or the occult motivations of

00:14:13.365 --> 00:14:18.259
the characters (postulating an
"unconscious"

00:14:18.259 --> 00:14:19.460
for them).
 

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:22.692
In other words,
Brooks is not interested in

00:14:22.692 --> 00:14:27.389
developing a theory of the
author or a theory of character.

00:14:27.389 --> 00:14:31.356
Now I don't think he really
means to be dismissive of

00:14:31.356 --> 00:14:32.960
Freudian criticism.
 

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.062
I think he's really just
telling us that he's doing

00:14:35.062 --> 00:14:36.408
something different from that.
 

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:39.696
I would remind you in passing
that although we don't pause

00:14:39.696 --> 00:14:42.808
over traditional Freudian
criticism in this course,

00:14:42.808 --> 00:14:46.259
it can indeed be extremely
interesting: just for example,

00:14:46.259 --> 00:14:48.437
Freud's disciple,
Ernest Jones,

00:14:48.437 --> 00:14:52.721
wrote an influential study of
Shakespeare's Hamlet in

00:14:52.721 --> 00:14:57.370
which he showed famously that
Hamlet has an Oedipus complex.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:58.399
Think about the play.
 

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:01.340
You'll see that there's a good
deal in what Jones is saying;

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.870
and in fact,
famously in the history of the

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.158
staging and filming of
Shakespeare--

00:15:06.158 --> 00:15:10.110
as you probably know,
Sir Laurence Olivier took the

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.298
role of Hamlet under the
influence of Ernest Jones.

00:15:14.298 --> 00:15:17.890
In the Olivier production of
Hamlet,

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:22.509
let's just say made it
painfully clear in his relations

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:26.700
with Gertrude that he had an
Oedipus complex.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.278
Again, there were actual sort
of literary texts written

00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:34.668
directly under the influence of
Freud.

00:15:34.668 --> 00:15:37.361
One thinks of D.H. Lawrence's
Sons and Lovers,

00:15:37.361 --> 00:15:40.389
for example,
in which the central character,

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:43.279
Paul Morel,
is crippled by an Oedipus

00:15:43.279 --> 00:15:47.546
complex that he can't master and
the difficulties and

00:15:47.546 --> 00:15:51.320
complications of the plot are of
this kind.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.403
Moving closer to the present,
an important figure in literary

00:15:55.403 --> 00:15:58.668
theory whom we'll be studying in
this course,

00:15:58.668 --> 00:16:01.466
Harold Bloom,
can be understood to be

00:16:01.466 --> 00:16:05.350
developing in his theories of
theoretical text,

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.924
beginning with The Anxiety
of Influence, a

00:16:07.924 --> 00:16:10.316
theory of the author--
that is to say,

00:16:10.316 --> 00:16:15.130
a theory that is based on the
relationship between belated

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:20.025
poets and their precursors,
which is to say a relationship

00:16:20.025 --> 00:16:22.000
between sons and fathers.
 

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.830
So there is a certain pattern
in--and of course,

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.186
I invoke this pattern in
arguing that Levi-Strauss'

00:16:30.186 --> 00:16:35.153
version of the Oedipus myth
betrays his Oedipus complex in

00:16:35.153 --> 00:16:37.070
relation to Freud.
 

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:40.990
Plainly, Freudian criticism
with these sorts of

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:46.217
preoccupations is widespread,
continues sometimes to appear,

00:16:46.217 --> 00:16:51.216
and cannot simply be discounted
or ignored as an influence in

00:16:51.216 --> 00:16:55.630
the development of thinking
about literature or of the

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.629
possibilities of thinking about
literature.

00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:02.769
But the odd thing,
or maybe not so odd--

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:06.056
the interesting thing,
that is, in Brooks' work is

00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:10.147
that although the text is not
there to tell us something about

00:17:10.147 --> 00:17:14.240
its author or to tell us
something about its characters,

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.075
even though character is
important in fiction and that's

00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:19.240
what Brooks is primarily talking
about--

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.038
although it's not there to do
those things it is nevertheless,

00:17:24.038 --> 00:17:28.548
like an author or a character,
in many ways alive.

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:33.426
That is to say,
the text is there to express

00:17:33.426 --> 00:17:39.664
desire, to put in motion,
and to make manifest desire or

00:17:39.664 --> 00:17:41.140
a desire.
 

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.387
That is a rather odd thing to
think about, especially when

00:17:45.387 --> 00:17:49.785
Brooks goes so far as to say
that he has a particular desire

00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:50.680
in mind.
 

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:54.338
The text, in other words,
the structure of the text,

00:17:54.338 --> 00:18:00.692
or the way in which the text
functions is to fulfill in some

00:18:00.692 --> 00:18:05.645
way or another a desire for
reduced excitation:

00:18:05.645 --> 00:18:09.406
that is to say,
the desire which can be

00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:13.391
associated with the pleasure
principle in sexual terms and

00:18:13.391 --> 00:18:17.515
can be associated with the idea
of the death wish that Freud

00:18:17.515 --> 00:18:21.499
develops in Beyond the
Pleasure Principle that I'll

00:18:21.499 --> 00:18:25.133
be coming back to as the
reduction of excitation that

00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:27.720
would consist in being dead.
 

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.960
In these ways--and it remains
to see whether,

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.670
or to what extent,
these ways are cooperative--

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:40.740
Brooks understands the
structure, the delay,

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.234
the arabesque,
or postponement of the end one

00:18:45.234 --> 00:18:51.468
finds in the text to involve a
kind of coexistence of the sort

00:18:51.468 --> 00:18:56.984
that I have been talking about
between relations to the

00:18:56.984 --> 00:19:02.808
possibility through desire of
reducing excitation,

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:06.410
being excited,
and reducing excitation.

00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:12.339
Now obviously both dreams and
stories don't just express this

00:19:12.339 --> 00:19:15.259
desire;
they also delay it.

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:18.606
I'm sure we have all had the
experience of waking up--it's an

00:19:18.606 --> 00:19:21.230
experience, by the way,
which is an illusion;

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.715
it hasn't really been the
case--and thinking that we have

00:19:24.715 --> 00:19:27.703
been dreaming the same damn
thing all night long:

00:19:27.703 --> 00:19:30.829
in other words,
that we have just been

00:19:30.829 --> 00:19:36.042
interminably stuck in a dream
predicament which repeats itself

00:19:36.042 --> 00:19:41.769
again and again and again to the
point of absolute total tedium.

00:19:41.769 --> 00:19:45.527
Many of the dreams we have are
neither exciting nor the reverse

00:19:45.527 --> 00:19:46.798
but simply tedious.
 

00:19:46.798 --> 00:19:51.076
Whatever excitement they may
have entailed in the long run,

00:19:51.076 --> 00:19:54.690
we feel as we wake up that they
go on too long.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:20:01.422
Perhaps fiction does have this
superiority over the dream work:

00:20:01.422 --> 00:20:05.221
that its art,
that its structure,

00:20:05.221 --> 00:20:11.737
is precisely the protraction of
delay to a desired degree but

00:20:11.737 --> 00:20:15.318
not unduly beyond that degree.
 

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:22.403
But it's not just that the
middles of fiction involve these

00:20:22.403 --> 00:20:24.970
processes of delay.
 

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:29.746
It's that they seem also--and
this is one of the reasons

00:20:29.746 --> 00:20:35.130
Brooks does have recourse to
this particular text of Freud--

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:39.603
they also have the curious
tendency to revisit

00:20:39.603 --> 00:20:41.890
unpleasurable things.
 

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.411
That is to say,
it's not that--the middles of

00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:45.730
fiction are exciting.
 

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:49.933
We love to read and everything
we read is a page turner,

00:20:49.933 --> 00:20:53.549
all to the good;
but the fact is our fascination

00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:57.740
with reading isn't simply a
fascination that takes the form

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:58.970
of having fun.
 

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:03.472
In fact, so much of what we
read in fiction is distinctly

00:21:03.472 --> 00:21:04.759
unpleasurable.
 

00:21:04.759 --> 00:21:08.690
We wince away from it even as
we turn the page.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.820
One way to put it,
especially in

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:15.358
nineteenth-century realism which
particularly interests Brooks,

00:21:15.358 --> 00:21:19.369
is all these characters are
just madly making bad object

00:21:19.369 --> 00:21:20.098
choices.
 

00:21:20.098 --> 00:21:22.608
They're falling in love with
the wrong person.

00:21:22.608 --> 00:21:26.961
They're getting stuck in sticky
situations that they can't

00:21:26.961 --> 00:21:31.618
extract themselves from because
they're not mature enough,

00:21:31.618 --> 00:21:33.630
because they haven't thought
things through,

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:37.496
and because fate looms over the
possibility of making a better

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.854
choice--
however the case may be,

00:21:39.854 --> 00:21:44.381
the experiences that constitute
the middles even of the greatest

00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:48.190
and the most exciting fiction do
have a tendency,

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:52.859
if one thinks about them from a
certain remove,

00:21:52.859 --> 00:21:54.940
to be unpleasurable.
 

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.693
Why, in other words,
return to what isn't fun,

00:21:57.693 --> 00:22:01.243
to where it isn't pleasure,
and what can this possibly have

00:22:01.243 --> 00:22:03.568
to do with the pleasure
principle?

00:22:03.568 --> 00:22:06.948
Now that's precisely the
question that Freud asked

00:22:06.948 --> 00:22:10.190
himself in Beyond the
Pleasure Principle,

00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:14.868
a text which begins with a
consideration of trauma victims.

00:22:14.868 --> 00:22:18.377
It's written at the end of the
First World War,

00:22:18.377 --> 00:22:22.724
and you should understand this
text as not isolated in the

00:22:22.724 --> 00:22:25.700
preoccupation of writers in
Europe.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.935
Almost contemporary with
Beyond the Pleasure Principle

00:22:29.935 --> 00:22:34.020
are novels written in
England partly as a result of

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.635
the making public of findings of
psychologists about traumatic

00:22:38.635 --> 00:22:42.568
war victims as the war came to
its conclusion.

00:22:42.568 --> 00:22:45.604
Most of you have read
Virginia's Woolf's Mrs.

00:22:45.604 --> 00:22:49.026
Dalloway, and you
should recognize that her

00:22:49.026 --> 00:22:53.029
treatment of Septimus Smith in
Mrs. Dalloway is a

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:55.868
treatment of a traumatized war
victim.

00:22:55.868 --> 00:22:58.080
Rebecca West,
a contemporary and an

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.528
acquaintance of hers who wrote a
good many novels,

00:23:01.528 --> 00:23:04.318
wrote one in particular called
The Return of the Soldier,

00:23:04.318 --> 00:23:09.750
the protagonist of which is
also a traumatized war victim.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.753
So it was a theme of the period
and Freud's Beyond the

00:23:12.753 --> 00:23:15.490
Pleasure Principle
contributes to this theme.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:21.142
Brooks himself likes to refer
to the text of Beyond the

00:23:21.142 --> 00:23:26.098
Pleasure Principle as itself
a master plot--

00:23:26.098 --> 00:23:29.410
in other words as having a
certain fictive character.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.662
It would be,
I think, extremely instructive

00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:36.922
to read it alongside The
Return of the Soldier or

00:23:36.922 --> 00:23:37.463
Mrs.
 

00:23:37.463 --> 00:23:41.259
Dalloway for the reasons
I've mentioned.

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:41.597
Okay.
 

00:23:41.597 --> 00:23:45.317
So anyway, Freud begins by
saying, "The weird thing

00:23:45.317 --> 00:23:49.509
about these trauma victims whom
I have had in my office is that

00:23:49.509 --> 00:23:53.567
in describing their dreams and
even in their various forms of

00:23:53.567 --> 00:23:57.967
neurotic repetitive behavior,
they seem compulsively to

00:23:57.967 --> 00:24:02.519
repeat the traumatic experience
that has put them in the very

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:05.480
predicament that brought them to
me.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.808
In other words,
they don't shy away from it.

00:24:07.808 --> 00:24:11.500
They don't in any strict sense
repress it.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.170
They keep compulsively going
back to it.

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:15.578
Why is that?
 

00:24:15.578 --> 00:24:20.251
How can that possibly be a
manifestation of the only kind

00:24:20.251 --> 00:24:25.509
of drives I had ever thought
existed up until the year 1919,

00:24:25.509 --> 00:24:29.130
namely drives that we can
associate in one way or another

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.111
with pleasure--
with the pleasure principle,

00:24:32.111 --> 00:24:35.121
obviously;
with a sort of implicit

00:24:35.121 --> 00:24:41.045
sociobiological understanding
that the protraction of life is

00:24:41.045 --> 00:24:46.673
all about sexual reproduction
and that the displacement or

00:24:46.673 --> 00:24:52.596
inhibition of the direct drives
associated with that take the

00:24:52.596 --> 00:24:58.809
form of the desire to succeed,
the desire to improve oneself,

00:24:58.809 --> 00:25:03.730
and the desire to become more
complex emotionally and all the

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:04.880
rest of it?
 

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.410
All of this we can associate
with the pleasure principle.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:14.351
How does this compulsion to
return to the traumatic event in

00:25:14.351 --> 00:25:20.493
any way correspond to or submit
itself to explanation in terms

00:25:20.493 --> 00:25:24.118
of the pleasure principle?"
 

00:25:24.118 --> 00:25:28.568
So then he turns to an example
in his own home life,

00:25:28.568 --> 00:25:31.390
his little grandson,
little Hans,

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:36.679
standing in his crib throwing a
spool tied to a string out of

00:25:36.679 --> 00:25:39.479
the crib saying,
"Fort!"

00:25:39.479 --> 00:25:41.145
meaning "away,
not there,"

00:25:41.145 --> 00:25:43.288
and then reeling it back in and
saying,

00:25:43.288 --> 00:25:45.207
"Da!"
meaning "there it is

00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:46.390
again": "Fort!
 

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.295
Da!"
Why on earth is little Hans

00:25:49.295 --> 00:25:50.240
doing this?
 

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.359
Well, Freud pretty quickly
figures out that what little

00:25:53.359 --> 00:25:56.769
Hans is doing is finding a way
of expressing his frustration

00:25:56.769 --> 00:25:59.890
about the way in which his
mother leaves the room;

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:03.105
in other words,
his mother is not always there

00:26:03.105 --> 00:26:03.818
for him.
 

00:26:03.818 --> 00:26:08.410
So what is this play
accomplishing?

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.670
He's got her on a string, right?
 

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:13.453
Sure, she goes away--we have to
understand this:

00:26:13.453 --> 00:26:16.240
we know our mother goes away,
but guess what?

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:20.618
I can haul her back in,
and there she is again.

00:26:20.618 --> 00:26:26.366
This is the achievement of
mastery, as Freud puts it and as

00:26:26.366 --> 00:26:31.321
Brooks follows him,
that we can acquire through the

00:26:31.321 --> 00:26:34.890
repetition of a traumatic event.
 

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:37.338
So maybe that's the way to
think about it,

00:26:37.338 --> 00:26:41.509
but it can't just be the
achievement of mastery alone,

00:26:41.509 --> 00:26:46.323
because nothing can do away
with or undermine the fact that

00:26:46.323 --> 00:26:51.798
part of the drive involved seems
to be to return to the trauma--

00:26:51.798 --> 00:26:55.702
that is to say,
to keep putting before us the

00:26:55.702 --> 00:27:00.140
unhappy and traumatic nature of
what's involved.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:04.613
So the compulsion to repeat,
which of course manifests

00:27:04.613 --> 00:27:09.509
itself in adults in various
forms of neurotic behavior--

00:27:09.509 --> 00:27:12.739
by the way, we're all neurotic
and all of us have our little

00:27:12.739 --> 00:27:15.540
compulsions,
but it can get serious in some

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:19.721
cases--
the compulsion to repeat takes

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:22.404
the form,
Freud argues,

00:27:22.404 --> 00:27:29.028
especially if we think of it in
terms of an effort at mastery,

00:27:29.028 --> 00:27:33.098
of mastering in advance through
rehearsal,

00:27:33.098 --> 00:27:36.328
as it were, the inevitability
of death,

00:27:36.328 --> 00:27:41.167
the trauma of death which
awaits and which has been

00:27:41.167 --> 00:27:45.618
heralded by traumatic events in
one's life,

00:27:45.618 --> 00:27:47.354
a near escape:
for example,

00:27:47.354 --> 00:27:50.690
in a train accident or whatever
the case may be.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:55.344
So Freud in developing his
argument eventually comes to

00:27:55.344 --> 00:28:00.429
think that the compulsion to
repeat has something to do with

00:28:00.429 --> 00:28:05.342
a kind of repeating forward of
an event which is in itself

00:28:05.342 --> 00:28:08.788
unnarratable:
the event of death,

00:28:08.788 --> 00:28:14.118
which is of course that which
ultimately looms.

00:28:14.118 --> 00:28:19.784
Now it's in this context that
Freud begins to think about how

00:28:19.784 --> 00:28:25.448
it could be that the organism
engages itself with thoughts of

00:28:25.448 --> 00:28:26.769
this kind.
 

00:28:26.769 --> 00:28:32.710
What is this almost eager
anticipation of death?

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:37.038
He notices that in certain
biological organisms,

00:28:37.038 --> 00:28:41.615
it can be observed--this by the
way has been wildly disputed by

00:28:41.615 --> 00:28:44.420
people actually engaged in
biology,

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:50.446
but it was a useful metaphor
for the development of Freud's

00:28:50.446 --> 00:28:56.787
argument: he noticed that there
is in certain organisms a wish

00:28:56.787 --> 00:29:01.982
to return to a simpler and
earlier state of organic

00:29:01.982 --> 00:29:06.025
existence,
which is to say to return to

00:29:06.025 --> 00:29:10.900
that which isn't just what we
all look forward to but was,

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:15.611
after all, that which existed
prior to our emergence into

00:29:15.611 --> 00:29:16.200
life.
 

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.568
The relationship between the
beginning and the end that I

00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:21.734
have been intimating,
in other words,

00:29:21.734 --> 00:29:23.358
is a relation of death.
 

00:29:23.358 --> 00:29:29.190
I begin inanimate and I end
inanimate,

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:33.635
and Freud's argument is that
there is somehow in us a

00:29:33.635 --> 00:29:38.977
compulsion or a desire,
a drive, to return--like going

00:29:38.977 --> 00:29:45.523
home again or going back to the
womb to return to that inanimate

00:29:45.523 --> 00:29:46.460
state.
 

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.854
"The aim of all
life," he then says,

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:51.588
"is death."
 

00:29:51.588 --> 00:29:56.054
Well, now maybe the important
thing is to allow Brooks to

00:29:56.054 --> 00:30:00.997
comment on that so that you can
see how he makes use of Freud's

00:30:00.997 --> 00:30:05.540
idea and move us a little bit
closer to the application of

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:09.846
these ideas to the structure of
a literary plot or of a

00:30:09.846 --> 00:30:11.680
fictional plot.
 

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.267
So on page 1166 in the
right-hand margin,

00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:22.460
the beginning of the second
paragraph, Brooks says:

00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.205
We need at present to follow
Freud into his closer inquiry

00:30:26.205 --> 00:30:30.347
concerning the relation between
the compulsion to repeat and the

00:30:30.347 --> 00:30:31.400
instinctual.
 

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.618
The answer lies in "a
universal attribute of instinct

00:30:35.618 --> 00:30:38.875
and perhaps of organic life in
general,"

00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:43.539
that "an instinct is an
urge inherent in organic life to

00:30:43.539 --> 00:30:47.390
restore an earlier state of
things."

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:52.661
Building on this idea,
page 1169, the left-hand

00:30:52.661 --> 00:30:59.654
column, about halfway down:
This function [of the drives]

00:30:59.654 --> 00:31:06.644
is concerned "with the
most universal endeavor of all

00:31:06.644 --> 00:31:11.325
living substance--
namely to return to the

00:31:11.325 --> 00:31:15.078
quiescence of the inorganic
world."

00:31:15.078 --> 00:31:17.778
Kind of pleasant,
I guess, right?

00:31:17.778 --> 00:31:22.435
"The desire to return to
the quiescence of the organic

00:31:22.435 --> 00:31:23.558
world."
 

00:31:23.558 --> 00:31:29.012
The aim in this context,
in this sense--the aim of all

00:31:29.012 --> 00:31:30.660
life is death.
 

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:35.097
But there's more,
and this is why novels are

00:31:35.097 --> 00:31:38.513
long: not too long,
not too short,

00:31:38.513 --> 00:31:42.086
but of a certain length--
of a certain magnitude,

00:31:42.086 --> 00:31:43.470
as Aristotle puts it.
 

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:47.421
There is more because the
organism doesn't just want to

00:31:47.421 --> 00:31:47.859
die.
 

00:31:47.859 --> 00:31:50.368
The organism is not suicidal.
 

00:31:50.368 --> 00:31:53.196
That's a crucial mistake that
we make when we first try to

00:31:53.196 --> 00:31:55.826
come to terms with what Freud
means by "the death

00:31:55.826 --> 00:31:56.568
wish."
 

00:31:56.568 --> 00:32:01.848
The organism wants to die on
its own terms,

00:32:01.848 --> 00:32:06.241
which is why it has an
elaborate mechanism of

00:32:06.241 --> 00:32:09.027
defenses--
"the outer cortex,"

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:13.010
as Freud is always calling it--
attempting to withstand,

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.096
to process,
and to keep at arm's length the

00:32:16.096 --> 00:32:17.490
possibility of trauma.
 

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:22.432
You blame yourself as a victim
of trauma for not having the

00:32:22.432 --> 00:32:27.460
sufficient vigilance in your
outer cortex to ward it off.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.250
Part of the compulsion to
repeat is,

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:34.394
in a certain sense--part of the
hope of mastery in the

00:32:34.394 --> 00:32:39.163
compulsion to repeat is to keep
up the kind of vigilance which

00:32:39.163 --> 00:32:43.778
you failed to have in the past
and therefore fail to ward it

00:32:43.778 --> 00:32:44.558
off.
 

00:32:44.558 --> 00:32:47.940
So the organism only wishes to
die on its own terms.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:52.823
If you are reminded here by the
passage of Tynjanov that I gave

00:32:52.823 --> 00:32:56.761
you where he makes the
distinction between literary

00:32:56.761 --> 00:33:01.644
history as evolving and literary
history as modified by outside

00:33:01.644 --> 00:33:04.608
circumstances,
I think it would be a

00:33:04.608 --> 00:33:05.920
legitimate parallel.
 

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.608
What the organism,
according to Freud,

00:33:08.608 --> 00:33:12.769
wants to do is evolve toward
its dissolution,

00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:17.130
not to be modified--not,
in other words,

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:21.015
to be interfered with by
everything from external trauma

00:33:21.015 --> 00:33:22.569
to internal disease.
 

00:33:22.569 --> 00:33:23.759
It doesn't want that.
 

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:26.358
It wants to live a rich and
full life.

00:33:26.358 --> 00:33:29.009
It wants to live a life of a
certain magnitude,

00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:35.308
but with a view to achieving
the ultimate desired end,

00:33:35.308 --> 00:33:38.981
which is to return to an
inorganic state on its own

00:33:38.981 --> 00:33:39.568
terms.
 

00:33:39.568 --> 00:33:45.294
So there is this tension in the
organism between evolving to its

00:33:45.294 --> 00:33:50.019
end and being modified
prematurely toward an end,

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:53.355
a modification which in terms
of fiction would mean you

00:33:53.355 --> 00:33:55.210
wouldn't have a plot,
right?

00:33:55.210 --> 00:34:00.451
You might have a beginning,
but you would have a sudden

00:34:00.451 --> 00:34:05.887
cutting off that prevented the
arabesque of the plot from

00:34:05.887 --> 00:34:08.510
developing and arising.
 

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.429
Now what Brooks argues
following Freud is that to this

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:17.273
end,
the creating of an atmosphere

00:34:17.273 --> 00:34:21.460
in which with dignity and
integrity,

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:22.590
as it were,
&gt;

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.119
the organism can progress
toward its own end without

00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:30.175
interference,
as it were--what Brooks

00:34:30.175 --> 00:34:33.659
following Freud argues is that
in this process,

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:37.480
the pleasure principle and the
death wish cooperate.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.349
This is on page 1166,
bottom of the right-hand

00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:46.510
column, and then over to 1167,
a relatively long passage:

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:50.559
Hence Freud is able to proffer,
with a certain bravado,

00:34:50.559 --> 00:34:53.856
the formulation:
"the aim of all life is

00:34:53.856 --> 00:34:56.945
death."
We are given an evolutionary

00:34:56.945 --> 00:35:01.224
image of the organism in which
the tension created by external

00:35:01.224 --> 00:35:05.364
influences has forced living
substance to "diverge ever

00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:09.574
more widely from its original
course of life and to make ever

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:12.661
more complicated
détours before

00:35:12.661 --> 00:35:15.750
reaching its aim of death."
 

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.958
In this view,
the self-preservative instincts

00:35:18.958 --> 00:35:23.043
function to assure that the
organism shall follow its own

00:35:23.043 --> 00:35:26.065
path to death,
to ward off any ways of

00:35:26.065 --> 00:35:30.617
returning to the inorganic which
are not imminent to the organism

00:35:30.617 --> 00:35:31.329
itself.
 

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:34.077
In other words,
"the organism wishes to

00:35:34.077 --> 00:35:36.380
die only in its own
fashion."

00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.760
It must struggle against events
(dangers) which would help to

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.070
achieve its goal too rapidly--by
a kind of short-circuit.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:48.762
Again on page 1169,
left-hand column,

00:35:48.762 --> 00:35:54.815
a little bit farther down from
the passage we quoted before,

00:35:54.815 --> 00:35:58.157
Brooks says:
â€¦ [W]e could say that

00:35:58.157 --> 00:36:01.413
the repetition compulsion and
the death instinct serve the

00:36:01.413 --> 00:36:04.492
pleasure principle;
in a larger sense [though],

00:36:04.492 --> 00:36:08.068
the pleasure principle,
keeping watch on the invasion

00:36:08.068 --> 00:36:11.518
of stimuli from without and
especially from within,

00:36:11.518 --> 00:36:15.099
seeking their discharge,
serves the death instinct,

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:19.878
making sure that the organism
is permitted to return to

00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:21.030
quiescence.
 

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:27.913
It's in this way that these two
differing drives coexist and in

00:36:27.913 --> 00:36:34.574
some measure cooperate in the
developing and enriching of the

00:36:34.574 --> 00:36:38.536
good life,
and in the developing and

00:36:38.536 --> 00:36:41.110
enriching of the good plot.
 

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:45.090
An obvious problem with this
theory,

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:48.170
and Freud acknowledges this
problem in Beyond the

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:52.585
Pleasure Principle,
is that it's awfully hard

00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:55.989
to keep death and sex separate.
 

00:36:55.989 --> 00:36:59.706
In other words,
the reduction of excitation is

00:36:59.706 --> 00:37:04.909
obviously something that the
pleasure principle is all about.

00:37:04.909 --> 00:37:11.159
The purpose of sex is to reduce
excitation, to annul desire.

00:37:11.159 --> 00:37:13.340
The purpose of death,
Freud argues,

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.010
is to do the same thing.
 

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.530
Well, how can you tell the one
from the other?

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:22.320
There's a rich vein of literary
history which insists on their

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.969
interchangeability.
 

00:37:23.969 --> 00:37:27.146
We all know what "to
die" means in early modern

00:37:27.146 --> 00:37:27.599
poems.
 

00:37:27.599 --> 00:37:30.474
We all know about
"Liebestod"

00:37:30.474 --> 00:37:32.969
in "Tristan and
Isolde,"

00:37:32.969 --> 00:37:36.980
the moments of death in
literature which obviously are

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.719
sexually charged.
 

00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:45.057
There is a kind of manifest and
knowing confusion of the two in

00:37:45.057 --> 00:37:48.007
literature--
and Freud always says that the

00:37:48.007 --> 00:37:50.590
poets preceded him in everything
that he thought--

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.942
which suggests that it is
rather hard to keep these things

00:37:53.942 --> 00:37:54.590
separate.
 

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:58.123
For example,
by the way, the compulsion to

00:37:58.123 --> 00:38:01.726
repeat nasty episodes,
to revisit trauma,

00:38:01.726 --> 00:38:04.460
and to repeat the
unpleasurable--

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.329
well, that could just be called
masochism, couldn't it?

00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:10.789
It could be called something
which is a kind of pleasure and

00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:13.780
which therefore could be
subsumed under the pleasure

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.358
principle and would obviate the
need for a theory of the death

00:38:17.358 --> 00:38:20.349
drive as Freud develops it in
Beyond the Pleasure

00:38:20.349 --> 00:38:23.340
Principle. Now Freud
acknowledges this.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.719
He says that it is difficult to
make the distinction.

00:38:26.719 --> 00:38:30.751
He feels that a variety of
sorts of clinical evidence at

00:38:30.751 --> 00:38:34.637
his disposal warrant the
distinction, but it is not an

00:38:34.637 --> 00:38:35.590
easy one.
 

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:41.233
It's one that I suppose we
could continue to entertain as a

00:38:41.233 --> 00:38:46.389
kind of skepticism about this
way of understanding the

00:38:46.389 --> 00:38:52.324
compulsion to repeat as somehow
necessarily entailing a theory

00:38:52.324 --> 00:38:54.659
of the death wish.
 

00:38:54.659 --> 00:38:55.766
All right.
 

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:58.755
Now quickly,
as to the plot:

00:38:58.755 --> 00:39:03.849
desire emerges or begins as the
narratable.

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:05.190
What is the unnarratable?
 

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:11.577
The unnarratable is that
immersion in our lives such that

00:39:11.577 --> 00:39:17.280
there is no sense of form or
order or structure.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.838
Anything is unnarratable if we
don't have a sense of a

00:39:21.838 --> 00:39:26.137
beginning, a middle,
and an end to bring to bear on

00:39:26.137 --> 00:39:26.739
it.
 

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:29.143
The narratable,
in other words,

00:39:29.143 --> 00:39:31.550
must enter into a structure.
 

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.132
So the beginning,
which is meditated on by

00:39:35.132 --> 00:39:40.025
Sartre's Roquentin in La
Nausee and quoted to that

00:39:40.025 --> 00:39:45.179
effect by Brooks on the
left-hand column of page 1163--

00:39:45.179 --> 00:39:50.199
the narratable begins in this
moment of entry into that

00:39:50.199 --> 00:39:54.289
pattern of desire that launches
a fiction.

00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:58.518
We have speculated on what that
desire consists in,

00:39:58.518 --> 00:40:03.338
and so the narratable becomes a
plot and the plot operates

00:40:03.338 --> 00:40:06.833
through metaphor,
which unifies the plot,

00:40:06.833 --> 00:40:11.380
which shows the remarkable
coherence of all of its parts.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.295
A narrative theory is always
talking with some satisfaction

00:40:15.295 --> 00:40:19.750
about how there's no such thing
in fiction as irrelevant detail.

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:22.329
In other words,
nothing is there by accident.

00:40:22.329 --> 00:40:27.686
That is the metaphoric pressure
brought to bear on plotting,

00:40:27.686 --> 00:40:31.320
sort of, in the course of
composition.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.074
Everything is there for a
reason, and the reason is

00:40:35.074 --> 00:40:39.431
arguably the nature of the
underlying desire that's driving

00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:42.893
the plot forward;
but on the other hand,

00:40:42.893 --> 00:40:46.661
metonymy functions as the
principle of delay,

00:40:46.661 --> 00:40:51.199
the detour, the arabesque,
the refusal of closure;

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:56.297
the settling upon bad object
choice and other unfortunate

00:40:56.297 --> 00:40:58.690
outcomes,
the return of the

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:03.282
unpleasurable--all the things
that happen in the structure of

00:41:03.282 --> 00:41:06.420
"middles"
in literary plots.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.927
The plot finally binds material
together, and both metaphor and

00:41:10.927 --> 00:41:13.909
metonymy are arguably forms of
binding.

00:41:13.909 --> 00:41:17.704
Look at page 1166,
the right-hand column,

00:41:17.704 --> 00:41:20.739
bottom of the first paragraph.
 

00:41:20.739 --> 00:41:23.851
Brooks says:
To speak of "binding"

00:41:23.851 --> 00:41:27.324
in a literary text is thus to
speak of any of the

00:41:27.324 --> 00:41:30.260
formalizations (which,
like binding,

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.427
may be painful,
retarding) that force us to

00:41:33.427 --> 00:41:36.518
recognize sameness within
difference,

00:41:36.518 --> 00:41:40.708
or the very emergence of a
sjuÅ¾et from the material

00:41:40.708 --> 00:41:42.079
of fabula.
 

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:42.429
Okay.
 

00:41:42.429 --> 00:41:46.978
Now I want to turn to Tony
as an instance of the way in

00:41:46.978 --> 00:41:50.260
which reading for the plot can
take place.

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:55.065
I also want to mention that the
choice of these materials for

00:41:55.065 --> 00:41:59.311
today's assignment is not just a
way into questions of

00:41:59.311 --> 00:42:04.679
psychoanalysis as they bear on
literature and literary theory,

00:42:04.679 --> 00:42:07.876
but also a gesture toward
something that those of you

00:42:07.876 --> 00:42:11.382
whose favorite form of reading
is novels may wish we had a

00:42:11.382 --> 00:42:14.150
little more of in a course of
this kind--

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.329
namely narrative theory:
narratology.

00:42:16.329 --> 00:42:20.905
I commend to you the opening
pages of Brooks' essay where he

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:25.559
passes in review some of the
most important work in narrative

00:42:25.559 --> 00:42:28.920
theory,
work that I mentioned in

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:34.797
passing when I talked about
structuralism a couple of weeks

00:42:34.797 --> 00:42:38.871
back and work which,
for those of you who are

00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:42.090
interested in narrative and
narrative theory,

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.969
you may well wish to revisit.
 

00:42:43.969 --> 00:42:46.280
Roland Barthes,
Tzvetan Todorov,

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.085
and Gerard Genette are the
figures to whom Brooks is

00:42:50.085 --> 00:42:53.365
primarily expressing
indebtedness within that

00:42:53.365 --> 00:42:54.559
tradition.
 

00:42:54.559 --> 00:42:57.929
Anyway: Tony the Tow Truck.
 

00:42:57.929 --> 00:43:02.353
I would suggest that in the
context of Beyond the

00:43:02.353 --> 00:43:07.260
Pleasure Principle we could
re-title Tony the Tow Truck

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.559
as The Bumpy Road to
Maturity.

00:43:10.559 --> 00:43:13.981
It certainly has the
qualities of a picaresque

00:43:13.981 --> 00:43:14.679
fiction.
 

00:43:14.679 --> 00:43:19.226
It's on the road,
as it were, and the linearity

00:43:19.226 --> 00:43:22.362
of its plot--
the way in which the plot is

00:43:22.362 --> 00:43:25.532
like beads on a string,
which tends to be the case with

00:43:25.532 --> 00:43:28.764
picaresque fiction,
and which by the way is also a

00:43:28.764 --> 00:43:31.130
metonymic aspect of the
fiction--

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:38.989
lends the feeling of
picturesque to the narrative.

00:43:38.989 --> 00:43:43.775
Quickly to reread it--I know
that you all have it glued to

00:43:43.775 --> 00:43:48.309
your wrists, but in case you
don't, I'll reread it:

00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:50.940
I am Tony the Tow Truck.
 

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:53.679
I live in a little yellow
garage.

00:43:53.679 --> 00:43:55.849
I help cars that are stuck.
 

00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:57.969
I tow them to my garage.
 

00:43:57.969 --> 00:43:59.610
I like my job.
 

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:02.039
One day I am stuck.
 

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:04.250
Who will help Tony the Tow
Truck?

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:07.590
"I cannot help you,"
says Neato the Car.

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:09.159
"I don't want to get
dirty."

00:44:09.159 --> 00:44:13.036
"I cannot help you [see,
these are bad object choices,

00:44:13.036 --> 00:44:15.510
right?],"
says Speedy the Car.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:17.489
"I am too busy."
 

00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:19.250
I am very sad.
 

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:21.429
Then a little car pulls up.
 

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:23.309
It is my friend, Bumpy.
 

00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:25.579
Bumpy gives me a push.
 

00:44:25.579 --> 00:44:29.304
He pushes and pushes [by the
way, this text,

00:44:29.304 --> 00:44:34.239
I think, is very close to its
surface a kind of anal-phase

00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:35.280
parable.
 

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.356
In that parable,
the hero is not Tony in fact

00:44:38.356 --> 00:44:42.552
but a character with whom you
are familiar if you're familiar

00:44:42.552 --> 00:44:46.827
with South Park,
and that character is of course

00:44:46.827 --> 00:44:49.344
the one who says,
"He pushes and

00:44:49.344 --> 00:44:52.110
pushesâ€¦"]
and I am on my way."

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:54.989
[In any case that is part of
the narrative,

00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:56.771
and then:]
"Thank you,

00:44:56.771 --> 00:44:58.760
Bumpy,"
I call back.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:00.980
"You're welcome,"
says Bumpy.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.690
Now that's what I call a friend.
 

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:05.869
So that's the text of Tony
the Tow Truck.

00:45:05.869 --> 00:45:08.969
Now we've said that it's
picaresque.

00:45:08.969 --> 00:45:13.065
We can think in terms of
repetition, obviously,

00:45:13.065 --> 00:45:18.139
as the delay that sets in
between an origin and an end.

00:45:18.139 --> 00:45:21.726
We've spoken of this in this
case as--well,

00:45:21.726 --> 00:45:26.679
it's the triadic form of the
folk tale that Brooks actually

00:45:26.679 --> 00:45:31.813
mentions in his essay;
but it is, in its dilation of

00:45:31.813 --> 00:45:37.744
the relationship of beginning
and end, a way of reminding us

00:45:37.744 --> 00:45:40.760
precisely of that relation.
 

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.989
He comes from a little yellow
garage.

00:45:43.989 --> 00:45:47.302
The question is,
and a question which is perhaps

00:45:47.302 --> 00:45:50.900
part of the unnarratable,
is he going back there?

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.900
We know he's on his way,
but we don't know,

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.396
if we read it in terms of
Beyond the Pleasure

00:45:56.396 --> 00:45:59.029
Principle,
whether he's on his way back to

00:45:59.029 --> 00:46:01.150
the little yellow garage or
whether--

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:04.030
and there's a premonition of
this in being stuck,

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.768
in other words in having broken
down--

00:46:05.768 --> 00:46:08.010
whether he's on his way to the
junkyard.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.269
In either case,
the only point is that he will

00:46:11.269 --> 00:46:15.472
go to either place because the
little yellow garage is that

00:46:15.472 --> 00:46:19.373
from which he came;
in either case--little yellow

00:46:19.373 --> 00:46:23.117
garage or junkyard--
he's going to get there on his

00:46:23.117 --> 00:46:25.902
own terms,
but not as a narcissist and not

00:46:25.902 --> 00:46:29.583
as the person who begins every
sentence in the first part of

00:46:29.583 --> 00:46:31.891
the story with the word
"I,"

00:46:31.891 --> 00:46:35.010
because you can't just be an
autonomous hero.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:38.534
On your journey,
and this is also true of the

00:46:38.534 --> 00:46:41.659
study of folklore,
you need a helper.

00:46:41.659 --> 00:46:44.079
That's part of fiction.
 

00:46:44.079 --> 00:46:46.070
You need another hero.
 

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.789
You need a hero to help you,
and having that hero,

00:46:49.789 --> 00:46:53.530
encountering the other mind as
helper,

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:59.280
is what obviates the tendency,
even in a nice guy like Tony,

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.898
toward narcissism which is
manifest in the "I,"

00:47:01.898 --> 00:47:03.159
"I,"
"I"

00:47:03.159 --> 00:47:04.750
at the beginning of the story.
 

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.713
Notice that then the
"I"

00:47:06.713 --> 00:47:10.045
disappears, not completely but
wherever it reappears it's

00:47:10.045 --> 00:47:12.010
embedded rather than initial.
 

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:14.094
It is no longer,
in other words,

00:47:14.094 --> 00:47:16.920
that which drives the line in
the story.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:21.159
So the arabesque of the plot,
as I say,

00:47:21.159 --> 00:47:24.967
is a matter of encountering bad
object choices and overcoming

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:27.996
them: neatness,
busyness--choices which,

00:47:27.996 --> 00:47:30.829
by the way,
are on the surface temptations.

00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:33.130
We all want to be neat and
busy, don't we?

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.760
But somehow or another it's not
enough because the otherness,

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.663
the mutuality of regard that
this story wants to enforce as

00:47:41.663 --> 00:47:44.815
life--
as life properly lived--is not

00:47:44.815 --> 00:47:49.110
entailed in and of itself in
neatness and busyness.

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:54.559
Resolution and closure,
then, is mature object choice

00:47:54.559 --> 00:48:00.217
and in a certain sense there,
too, it's a push forward,

00:48:00.217 --> 00:48:04.409
but we don't quite know toward
what.

00:48:04.409 --> 00:48:07.934
We have to assume,
though, in the context of a

00:48:07.934 --> 00:48:12.947
reading of this kind that it's a
push toward a state in which the

00:48:12.947 --> 00:48:17.097
little yellow garage and the
unnarratable junkyard are

00:48:17.097 --> 00:48:20.309
manifest as one and the same
thing.

00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:23.447
Now as metonymy,
the delays we have been talking

00:48:23.447 --> 00:48:26.403
about,
the paratactic structure of the

00:48:26.403 --> 00:48:30.130
way in which the story is told--
all of those,

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:35.186
and the elements of repetition,
are forms that we recognize as

00:48:35.186 --> 00:48:37.309
metonymic,
but there's something beyond

00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:38.650
that at the level of theme.
 

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:40.869
This is a story about cars.
 

00:48:40.869 --> 00:48:43.980
This is a story about
mechanical objects,

00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.880
some of which move--remember
those smiling houses in the

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.275
background--
and some of which are

00:48:49.275 --> 00:48:53.059
stationary, but they're all
mechanical objects.

00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:53.940
They're all structures.
 

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.518
In other words,
they're not organic.

00:48:56.518 --> 00:49:00.898
This is a world understood from
a metonymic point of view as

00:49:00.898 --> 00:49:05.324
that which lacks organicity,
and yet at the same time the

00:49:05.324 --> 00:49:09.349
whole point of the story is
thematically metaphoric.

00:49:09.349 --> 00:49:12.706
It is to assert the common
humanity of us all:

00:49:12.706 --> 00:49:15.840
"That's what I call a
friend."

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:19.460
The whole point of so many
children's stories,

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:21.369
animal stories,
other stories like this,

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:22.659
The Little Engine that
Could,

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:27.074
and so on is to
humanize the world:

00:49:27.074 --> 00:49:32.867
to render friendly and warm and
inviting to the child the entire

00:49:32.867 --> 00:49:35.952
world,
so that Tony is not a tow

00:49:35.952 --> 00:49:40.567
truck--Tony's a human being,
and he realizes humanity in

00:49:40.567 --> 00:49:43.639
recognizing the existence of a
friend.

00:49:43.639 --> 00:49:46.239
The unity of the story,
in other words,

00:49:46.239 --> 00:49:50.105
as opposed to its metonymic
displacements through the

00:49:50.105 --> 00:49:53.713
mechanistic,
is the triumphant humanization

00:49:53.713 --> 00:49:58.699
of the mechanistic and the fact
that as we read the story,

00:49:58.699 --> 00:50:02.338
we feel that we are,
after all, not in mechanical

00:50:02.338 --> 00:50:04.690
company but in human company.
 

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:07.989
That's the effect of the story
and the way it works.

00:50:07.989 --> 00:50:09.989
In terms of the pleasure
principle then,

00:50:09.989 --> 00:50:14.030
life is best in a human
universe and in terms of--

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:16.748
well, in terms of Beyond the
Pleasure Principle,

00:50:16.748 --> 00:50:19.420
the whole point of returning
to an earlier state,

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.750
the little yellow garage or
junkyard,

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:27.199
is to avert the threat that one
being stuck will return to that

00:50:27.199 --> 00:50:31.329
junkyard prematurely or along
the wrong path.

00:50:31.329 --> 00:50:31.789
Okay.
 

00:50:31.789 --> 00:50:36.909
So next time we will turn to
the somewhat formidable task of

00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:38.820
understanding Lacan.

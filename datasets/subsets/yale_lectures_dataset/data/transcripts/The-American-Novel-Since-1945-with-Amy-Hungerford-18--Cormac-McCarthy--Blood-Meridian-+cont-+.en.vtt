00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.002
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Starting on page

00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:05.280
312, here is the little detail.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.930
This is the kid after he has
left the Glanton Gang.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.330
They've been routed by the
Yumas, and now he is on his own.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.239
He traveled about--[This
is the middle of the page.]

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:26.930
He traveled about from place to
place.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.050
He did not avoid the company of
other men.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.352
He was treated with a certain
deference as one who had got on

00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:36.710
to terms with life beyond what
his years could account for.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.499
By now he'd come by a horse and
a revolver, the rudiments of an

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:42.960
outfit.
He worked at different trades.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.678
He had a Bible that he'd found
at the mining camps and he

00:00:46.678 --> 00:00:50.730
carried this book with him,
no word of which he could read.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.288
In his dark and frugal clothes
some took him for a sort of

00:00:54.288 --> 00:00:56.910
preacher, but he was no witness
to them,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.794
neither of things at hand nor
things to come,

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:03.348
he least of any man.
It's that detail of the Bible

00:01:03.348 --> 00:01:06.312
that interests me here.
He had a Bible he'd found at

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:08.736
the mining camps,
carried this book with him,

00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:10.719
"no word of which he could
read."

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.295
Why does the kid carry a Bible,
when he is illiterate,

00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:18.140
and why does it appear at this
moment in the narrative?

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.549
These are the questions I want
to try and answer.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.121
I want to account for this
little detail through an

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:28.477
argument that will pick up the
points I made about allusion on

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:33.120
Monday and integrate those into
a different kind of argument.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.430
What does this Bible signify at
this moment?

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.310
The kid, I would guess to most
of you, seemed like,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.103
at this point,
he had become somewhat

00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:47.390
different.
Is that right?

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.466
Did you feel that,
by this point,

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:53.360
when he leaves the Glanton
Gang, he's matured in some way?

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.760
Did you feel that?
Yes?

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.220
No?
Yes.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.982
Maybe.
If you didn't,

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:06.670
you swam against McCarthy's own
prose.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.656
Remember that at a certain
point late in the novel he is no

00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:14.210
longer called the kid;
he is called the man.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.520
I'm sure most of you caught
that.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.281
What this says to us is that
McCarthy has built the structure

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.931
of the narrative along the
familiar line of the

00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:30.422
Bildungsroman,
the novel of a boy growing into

00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:33.758
a man.
It's hard to miss this when

00:02:33.758 --> 00:02:38.594
that's the character's only
name, and it changes in the

00:02:38.594 --> 00:02:41.614
middle.
This is a fairly obvious

00:02:41.614 --> 00:02:46.750
gesture towards that very
well-known narrative structure.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.759
There are other indicators,
though, that suggest a

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:55.526
transformation of the kid,
or some sort of complexity to

00:02:55.526 --> 00:03:00.309
the kid, that might be belied by
the way the narrative is

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.476
conducted.
Remember that difference I

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:07.110
pointed out on Monday between
Melville and McCarthy,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.062
between the interiority you get
through Ishmael as a narrator,

00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:13.590
the complexity of him as a
character,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.087
and the flatness of the kid.
You don't have an Ishmael

00:03:18.087 --> 00:03:21.000
character whose mind you can see
into.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.230
We don't see into the minds of
these people very often.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.022
If the Bible signifies,
as it seems to do to the people

00:03:31.022 --> 00:03:34.590
who see him and take him to be
some kind of preacher,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.902
to have some kind of wisdom,
if it suggests a development,

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:42.208
what kind of development is it?
The judge is the person who

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:46.013
gives us something to go on in
this respect,

00:03:46.013 --> 00:03:50.880
and if you look on page 299 we
can see what that is.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.486
The judge and the kid are at
odds in the desert after the

00:04:00.486 --> 00:04:05.056
rout of the gang,
and the kid is hiding with a

00:04:05.056 --> 00:04:09.378
loaded gun.
And the judge is hunting him,

00:04:09.378 --> 00:04:12.949
and he keeps calling out to the
kid.

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.710
"The priest has led you
to this boy.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.047
I know you would not hide.
I know too that you've not the

00:04:21.047 --> 00:04:24.263
heart of a common assassin.
I have passed before your gun

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.100
sights twice this hour and will
pass a third time.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.593
Why not show yourself?
No assassin," called the judge,

00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:35.228
"and no partisan either.
There is a flawed place in the

00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:38.991
fabric of your heart.
Do you think I could not know

00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:43.374
you alone were mutinous,
you alone reserved in your soul

00:04:43.374 --> 00:04:47.360
some corner of clemency for the
heathen."

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:54.139
The judge sets the kid apart
from himself and from the gang.

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.528
In this moment,
especially, we feel that the

00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:00.759
kid has some kind of moral
superiority,

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:05.130
some kind of resistance to the
violence that has been

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.660
dominating the novel up until
this time.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.692
You can see it,
also, in a late example of the

00:05:18.692 --> 00:05:21.670
judge.
He says, on 307,

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.267
when he meets up with the kid
much later when the kid is in

00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:33.954
prison (This is on 307,
about two thirds of the way

00:05:33.954 --> 00:05:35.320
down):

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.276
"Only each was called
upon to empty out his heart into

00:05:44.276 --> 00:05:47.830
the common and one did not.
Can you tell me who that was?"

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.420
"It was you," whispered the kid.
"You were the one."

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.731
[And then I'm going to skip
down a little bit.]

00:05:55.731 --> 00:06:01.449
"Our animosities were formed
and waiting before we two met,

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.449
yet even so you could have
changed it all."

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:11.253
The judge, here again,
singles out the kid as having

00:06:11.253 --> 00:06:16.604
somehow betrayed the gang,
and he suggests that--this is

00:06:16.604 --> 00:06:20.410
on the prior page--he has lied
to the authorities.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.353
But he suggests that the kid
had actually conspired with the

00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:29.626
Yumas to make it possible for
the Glanton Gang to be

00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:32.547
decimated,
that he had given them

00:06:32.547 --> 00:06:36.519
information and allowed them to
ambush the group.

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:42.170
He suggests that the kid was
actively working against the

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.180
gang in this scene.
Is this true?

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.542
Is the kid somehow special?
Does he stand apart from the

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:55.095
gang?
This is a question I want you

00:06:55.095 --> 00:06:58.510
to ponder.
Now, one very distinguished

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.473
reader of this novel,
Harold Bloom,

00:07:01.473 --> 00:07:05.996
has called the kid a hero.
There is a preface to the

00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:10.708
Modern Library Edition of this
novel where Bloom argues that

00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:15.500
the kid is the hero against the
heroic evil of the judge.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.722
And remember,
in my discussion of Milton's

00:07:18.722 --> 00:07:22.259
role as a source of allusion in
this novel,

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:27.408
what Milton's Satan brings with
him into this novel is that

00:07:27.408 --> 00:07:31.720
sense of heroic evil.
Bloom sees the kid as the

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.806
heroic good--flawed maybe,
maybe a little bit modest--but

00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:41.146
yet still the heroic good.
And Bloom actually makes a

00:07:41.146 --> 00:07:44.757
mistake that I think is quite
indicative of a mistake in

00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:48.100
reading.
That's he capitalizes "the kid."

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.831
He makes "kid" like a proper
name, capital K,

00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:55.664
Kid.
You never see it that way in

00:07:55.664 --> 00:07:59.390
the novel.
Is the kid a hero?

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:03.289
Is there moral development?
I want, now,

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:07.365
to see whether there's any case
to be made for this,

00:08:07.365 --> 00:08:12.081
and to do that I'm going to
track the kid through the middle

00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:15.614
of the novel.
There are about 75 pages in the

00:08:15.614 --> 00:08:19.601
exact center of the novel where
the kid does not appear very

00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:22.794
often.
This is also a structure that

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:28.319
pertains in Moby-Dick,
so this is again something

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:32.330
that he has partly borrowed from
Melville.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.990
When the kid does appear,
let's see what he does.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.531
This is during the time,
by the way, when they're just

00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:45.340
massacring anyone who is
breathing on the desert plain.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.124
Any peaceful tribe they come
across, they will skin anyone

00:08:50.124 --> 00:08:54.490
whose hair looks like it could
be an Indian scalp.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.650
Let's look first at 157.
This is the first place where

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:03.580
the kid is noted to appear in
this section.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:15.600
This is McGill emerging from
the burned encampment.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.426
McGill came out of the
crackling fires and stood

00:09:18.426 --> 00:09:20.399
staring bleakly at the scene
about.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:23.524
He had been skewered through
with a lance and he held the

00:09:23.524 --> 00:09:26.945
stalk of it before him.
It was fashioned from a sotol

00:09:26.945 --> 00:09:31.136
stalk and the point of an old
cavalry sword bound to the haft

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:34.000
curved out from the small of his
back.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.590
The kid waded out of the water
and approached him and the

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.220
Mexican sat down carefully on
the sand.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.529
"Get away from him," said
Glanton.

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:45.974
McGill turned to look at
Glanton and as he did so Glanton

00:09:45.974 --> 00:09:49.480
leveled his pistol and shot him
through the head.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.419
It looks like the kid is
approaching him as a kind of act

00:09:54.419 --> 00:09:57.767
of mercy.
Here is a man skewered through

00:09:57.767 --> 00:10:01.730
with a brutal weapon,
and the kid approaches him.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.002
Glanton's response is simply to
kill him, seeing him as more of

00:10:06.002 --> 00:10:08.689
a burden to the gang than
anything else,

00:10:08.689 --> 00:10:13.105
but the kid approaches.
Here, you do see a difference

00:10:13.105 --> 00:10:18.128
between the kid and Glanton,
at least in their approach to

00:10:18.128 --> 00:10:22.706
McGill.
162, a somewhat similar case

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:28.779
when Davy Brown has an arrow
through his leg.

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:34.549
Brown has asked someone to help
him push it through so he can

00:10:34.549 --> 00:10:39.550
then extract the arrow,
and everybody has refused.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.197
This is on 161.
"Boys," said Brown,

00:10:42.197 --> 00:10:45.000
"I'd doctorfy it myself but I
can't get no straight grip."

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.290
The judge looked up at him and
smiled.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.205
"Will you do us Holden?"
"No, Davy, I won't,

00:10:50.205 --> 00:10:53.679
but I tell you what I will do."
"What's that?"

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:56.857
"I'll write a policy on your
life against every mishap save

00:10:56.857 --> 00:10:58.730
the noose."
"Damn you, then."

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.654
So, they're just kind of
playing with him,

00:11:02.654 --> 00:11:06.100
and laughing at him as he
suffers.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:09.720
"Then finally the kid rose.
'I'll try her,' he said.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.275
'Good lad,' said Brown."
And they go through the process

00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:18.216
of pushing the arrow through,
and the priest chides him after

00:11:18.216 --> 00:11:21.116
this is all done.
When the kid returned to

00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:23.600
his own blanket,
the ex-priest leaned to him and

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.610
hissed at his ear,
"Fool," he said.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:29.659
"God will not love ye forever."
The kid turned to look at him.

00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:31.929
"Don't you know he'd have took
you with him?

00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:34.665
He'd have took you,
boy, like a bride to the

00:11:34.665 --> 00:11:37.547
altar."
I think what he means there is

00:11:37.547 --> 00:11:41.146
that David Brown would have
killed him, would have killed

00:11:41.146 --> 00:11:43.460
the kid if he had had the
chance,

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:50.041
somehow, in his moment of pain.
So, the kid does look,

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:55.279
again, he looks quite merciful,
in this passage.

00:11:55.279 --> 00:12:05.039
We see him on 169 at dinner
with the governor of Chiapas,

00:12:05.039 --> 00:12:09.000
Angel Trias.
This is on 169.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.445
This is a very brief mention.
"The kid in the first starched

00:12:15.445 --> 00:12:18.984
collar he'd ever owned and the
first cravat sat mute as a

00:12:18.984 --> 00:12:23.291
tailor's dummy at that board."
The ex-priest has sort of

00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:28.534
indicated with his eyes to note
that the judge and Trias are

00:12:28.534 --> 00:12:32.000
conversing in some unknown
language,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.732
a language that none of them
know, and it's as if to

00:12:34.732 --> 00:12:39.559
say--that look is as if to say,
"See there.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:43.509
He has a kind of mystical evil
about him.

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:47.209
He speaks even in these other
languages that no one can

00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:49.719
understand.
He's an otherworldly figure,"

00:12:49.719 --> 00:12:52.679
the ex-priest seems to be saying
just with his eyes.

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:56.830
The kid is just like a dummy
here.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.780
He is just a blank.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.160
On 173, this is the passage I
noted on Monday where Toadvine

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.800
and the kid are grumbling
against the judge and Glanton

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.957
because of their penchant for
massacring peaceful Indians and

00:13:15.957 --> 00:13:20.340
Toadvine puts the pistol to the
judge's head.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:25.597
There is a parallel moment in
the desert after the rout of the

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:29.389
gang when the kid does not kill
the judge;

00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:33.110
the kid has his chance and he
also does not kill the judge.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.150
So, this is another appearance
of the kid.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:37.929
They're talking together.
And, I won't read it,

00:13:37.929 --> 00:13:39.780
but you can look at it if you
like.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:46.256
That's on 173.
178, the kid instigates a bar

00:13:46.256 --> 00:13:47.100
fight.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:55.620
This is towards the middle of
the page.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.293
They're all assembled in a bar.
The kid addressed the

00:13:59.293 --> 00:14:02.469
table in his wretched Spanish
and demanded which among those

00:14:02.469 --> 00:14:04.730
sullen inebriates had spoken an
insult.

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:07.194
Before any could own it,
the first of the funeral

00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:10.274
rockets exploded in the street
as told and the entire company

00:14:10.274 --> 00:14:12.379
of Americans made for the
door.

00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:18.437
And this begins the chaos that
will eventuate in piles of

00:14:18.437 --> 00:14:23.629
bodies in this cantina as the
Americans leave.

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:31.493
And then on 204,
this is about the time that the

00:14:31.493 --> 00:14:40.950
kid returns to the narrative.
This is with Shelby.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:49.240
Remember, they've drawn lots to
see who will conduct the mercy

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.945
killing.
"Of the wounded men two were

00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:55.786
Delawares and one a Mexican.
The fourth was Dick Shelby and

00:14:55.786 --> 00:15:00.433
he alone sat watching the
preparations for departure," and

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:05.000
the kid draws the arrow,
but he does not kill Shelby.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.580
He lets Shelby die in the
desert.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.340
These moments look like a
kind of mercy,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.100
but I'm going to argue that
they are not,

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.816
in fact, instances of mercy,
that in the end they are not

00:15:20.816 --> 00:15:24.860
accountable for by any kind of
moral calculus,

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.670
that they resist that kind of
evaluation.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.321
Why?
Because every time the kid

00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:39.261
shows mercy, he shows mercy to
one of his own gang and we know

00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:43.500
what the gang goes on to do.
Right?

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.980
They simply go on killing more
people.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:54.545
So, the allegiance that he
seems to show with suffering,

00:15:54.545 --> 00:16:01.470
the mercy, is so selective that
it can't be called such,

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:07.065
and it's a kind of trick of
McCarthy's narrative to allow us

00:16:07.065 --> 00:16:12.659
to see the suffering of these
men in this kind of detail,

00:16:12.659 --> 00:16:17.660
while the suffering of all the
people they kill goes by pretty

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.266
quickly.
You do see infants being bashed

00:16:20.266 --> 00:16:23.320
together, or you see people run
through with lances.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.730
You see people's heads hacked
off;

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.823
you see many scalpings.
But there's never a moment when

00:16:28.823 --> 00:16:32.941
that's really focused on,
that we really see it and are

00:16:32.941 --> 00:16:36.220
asked to feel for that suffering
person.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.899
It's spectacular violence,
in that literal way that we

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:43.460
know that word "spectacle."

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.309
There is no moral
development.

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:53.580
Why do we think that there
should be?

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:58.509
I pointed out two reasons.
One is that the judge points

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:02.419
out, or argues that,
or advances the rhetoric that,

00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:05.860
the kid is different from all
the others.

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:09.509
That's one reason we think that.
The other reason is that he

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:13.583
transformed from "kid" to "man,"
and that old narrative of

00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:17.299
Bildungsroman suggests the
acquisition of wisdom.

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:20.972
And we associate wisdom with
moral complexity,

00:17:20.972 --> 00:17:23.910
moral sophistication,
moral depth.

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:29.524
These are things we bring to
the novel out of our immersion

00:17:29.524 --> 00:17:33.589
in a cultural tradition of such
stories.

00:17:33.589 --> 00:17:37.863
There are other reasons,
though, and I'm going to go to

00:17:37.863 --> 00:17:42.227
page 143 now.
This is the parable of the

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:45.814
traveler.
You'll recall that this is a

00:17:45.814 --> 00:17:51.133
story that the judge tells as a
kind of instructive story to the

00:17:51.133 --> 00:17:56.922
men as they're sitting around.
And the story is that there's a

00:17:56.922 --> 00:18:02.057
traveler passing through a wild
part of the mountains,

00:18:02.057 --> 00:18:06.610
and he is accosted by a man who
lives there.

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:17.839
The harness marker who lives
there invites the stranger in,

00:18:17.839 --> 00:18:24.780
and then tries to get money off
him and then finally the

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:30.460
traveler gives him a lecture on
morality.

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:35.717
In the end, as the traveler
leaves, the harness maker

00:18:35.717 --> 00:18:40.368
accosts him again,
and kills him and buries his

00:18:40.368 --> 00:18:43.864
bones.
The wife discovers this and

00:18:43.864 --> 00:18:47.269
cares for the bones of the
traveler.

00:18:47.269 --> 00:18:53.069
The son of the harness maker
becomes himself a killer of men.

00:18:53.069 --> 00:18:55.290
So, it's a little story
that we get here.

00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:05.738
The story seems to be about a
contention between good and

00:19:05.738 --> 00:19:12.138
evil, between the harness maker
who is a wild and chaotic force:

00:19:12.138 --> 00:19:17.982
he lives in the woods;
he dresses up as an Indian to

00:19:17.982 --> 00:19:23.171
perpetuate his crimes,
and he takes advantage of

00:19:23.171 --> 00:19:27.949
innocent victims.
The traveler is possessed of

00:19:27.949 --> 00:19:32.796
moral knowledge.
He can give a coherent moral

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:39.605
speech, and he is not unwilling
to exhort the harness maker

00:19:39.605 --> 00:19:45.514
towards a better life.
It seems to be all about moral

00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:51.860
contention, and the point of the
story, from the judge's point of

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.619
view, is to show that evil is an
inheritance.

00:19:56.619 --> 00:20:01.283
So, the son of the harness
maker becomes a killer of men,

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:05.529
too, but that the lack of a
father (The traveler,

00:20:05.529 --> 00:20:09.888
we find out,
had fathered a child who was as

00:20:09.888 --> 00:20:14.450
yet unborn, and so that child
when born is,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:19.329
as the judge says,
"euchered of his patrimony."

00:20:19.329 --> 00:20:24.575
This is on the bottom of 145:
"All his life he carries before

00:20:24.575 --> 00:20:30.084
him the idol of a perfection to
which he can never attain.") the

00:20:30.084 --> 00:20:35.242
absent father takes on this
quality of being a perfect model

00:20:35.242 --> 00:20:40.773
that the son can never attain.
He never learns that this man

00:20:40.773 --> 00:20:44.471
was a human being,
and therefore that he could

00:20:44.471 --> 00:20:48.910
never be the kind of ideal he
can be as a dead man.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.053
So, his point is that that
child's life is,

00:20:53.053 --> 00:20:58.098
as he says, "broken before a
frozen god and he will never

00:20:58.098 --> 00:21:02.144
find his way."
What this ending of the story

00:21:02.144 --> 00:21:06.742
doesn't tell us is that the
descendants of the traveler,

00:21:06.742 --> 00:21:11.257
of the innocent victim,
actually also become killers of

00:21:11.257 --> 00:21:14.530
men.
And we discover this at the

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:19.105
very end of the novel,
when the man makes his last

00:21:19.105 --> 00:21:23.839
kill, and this is on 323.
Remember the scene?

00:21:23.839 --> 00:21:31.038
The man is camped out outside
the village, and this group of

00:21:31.038 --> 00:21:35.797
bone pickers,
or sort of migrants in the

00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:40.808
desert come up to him,
and they're curious about the

00:21:40.808 --> 00:21:43.652
scapular of ears he wears.
I said on Monday that this

00:21:43.652 --> 00:21:45.610
belonged to Toadvine.
I was mistaken.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.619
It belongs to Davy Brown;
it belonged to David Brown.

00:21:49.619 --> 00:21:53.637
So, he's wearing Brown's
scapular of ears,

00:21:53.637 --> 00:21:57.849
and the travelers are curious
about this.

00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:02.942
And one boy in particular won't
believe him about their origin,

00:22:02.942 --> 00:22:06.720
and taunts him and sort of
calls him a liar.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.945
The group backs away.
That night, that young man

00:22:10.945 --> 00:22:14.520
comes back with his gun and he
says on 322:

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.839
"I know'd you'd be hid
out," the boy called.

00:22:21.839 --> 00:22:24.434
He [now "the man"]
pushed back the blanket and

00:22:24.434 --> 00:22:27.836
rolled onto his stomach and
cocked the pistol and leveled it

00:22:27.836 --> 00:22:31.700
at the sky where the clustered
stars were burning for eternity.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.653
He centered the foresight in
the milled groove of the frame

00:22:34.653 --> 00:22:37.759
strap and holding the piece so
he swung it through the dark of

00:22:37.759 --> 00:22:41.070
the trees with both hands to the
darker shape of the visitor.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.917
"I'm right here," he said.
The boy swung with the rifle

00:22:44.917 --> 00:22:47.637
and fired.
"You wouldn't have lived

00:22:47.637 --> 00:22:51.829
anyway," the man said.
And they come up,

00:22:51.829 --> 00:22:57.294
the boy's family or his
companions in the dawn,

00:22:57.294 --> 00:23:02.640
to get his body and they say,
top of 323:

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.359
"I know'd we'd bury him
on this prairie.

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:08.270
They come out here from
Kentucky, Mister,

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.490
this tyke and his brother,
his mama and daddy both dead.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.767
His granddaddy was killed by a
lunatic and buried in the woods

00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:20.828
like a dog." 
So, that little sentence tells

00:23:20.828 --> 00:23:26.349
us this is a descendant of the
traveler from the judge's story.

00:23:26.349 --> 00:23:30.649
That's who was killed by a
lunatic and buried in the woods

00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:34.767
like a dog.
The brother who's been killed

00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:39.960
by the kid, now the man,
tried to kill the kid.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:43.922
So, we know that he has become
a killer of men with that same

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:47.951
taste for mindless violence that
broods in the kid at the very

00:23:47.951 --> 00:23:51.977
start of the novel,
and his younger brother,

00:23:51.977 --> 00:23:56.470
about twelve,
inherits the dead boy's gun.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:01.218
So, we see that inheritance,
yet, of violence,

00:24:01.218 --> 00:24:04.274
continuing.
So, what appears to be a

00:24:04.274 --> 00:24:08.415
parable, what's told to the
group of men by the judge in the

00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:12.907
form of a parable-- invoking the
parables of the Bible which have

00:24:12.907 --> 00:24:16.946
spiritual,
moral lessons to them or

00:24:16.946 --> 00:24:23.541
can have spiritual,
moral lessons to them--that

00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:27.712
discourse is not,
in the end, a discourse that

00:24:27.712 --> 00:24:31.378
will divide killers of men from
people who are not the killers

00:24:31.378 --> 00:24:33.938
of men.
It does not help us to divide

00:24:33.938 --> 00:24:36.369
up the world between evil and
good.

00:24:36.369 --> 00:24:41.819
It does not track along those
lines that the judge's story

00:24:41.819 --> 00:24:45.835
about the kid,
that the kid is his nemesis,

00:24:45.835 --> 00:24:50.519
that the kid is the
counterforce to his evil.

00:24:50.519 --> 00:24:56.566
It does not track along
those lines, and in fact,

00:24:56.566 --> 00:25:03.660
the whole novel renders the
idea of a moral machinery moot,

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.961
and you can see that,
a little bit,

00:25:04.961 --> 00:25:07.839
too, in the epigraphs.
I won't stop on those right now.

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:11.029
The epigraphs to the novel
suggest, also,

00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:13.900
the futility of a moral
discourse.

00:25:18.309 --> 00:25:23.860
I argued on Monday that there
were two threads of tradition,

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.686
or inheritance,
or influence that McCarthy is

00:25:27.686 --> 00:25:32.522
drawing on: one historical--and
I noted Sam Chamberlain's source

00:25:32.522 --> 00:25:37.359
material from his account of his
life with the Glanton Gang--and

00:25:37.359 --> 00:25:41.120
then that whole train of
literary allusions that I

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.668
unearthed for you.
The historical is made moot in

00:25:45.668 --> 00:25:49.700
this wonderful little passage
from the judge.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:53.961
If the moral is made moot in
all these ways that I am

00:25:53.961 --> 00:25:58.304
discussing, the historical is
dismissed quite quickly,

00:25:58.304 --> 00:25:58.960
330.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.681
He says: 
"Men's memories" [This is

00:26:10.681 --> 00:26:14.580
the very last line of the page.]
"Men's memories are uncertain

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:18.287
and the past that was differs
little from the past that was

00:26:18.287 --> 00:26:20.970
not."
Think about that claim,

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.939
in the context of a historical
novel: "The past that was

00:26:24.939 --> 00:26:28.259
differs little from the past
that was not."

00:26:28.259 --> 00:26:32.585
You can read "the past that was
not" as the fictive past,

00:26:32.585 --> 00:26:36.360
the imagined past.
This claim is that the true

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.574
past has no significant
distinction from the fictive

00:26:40.574 --> 00:26:46.109
past, that men's memories are no
source of truth about the past.

00:26:46.109 --> 00:26:51.497
In this little line McCarthy
says to us, "That historical

00:26:51.497 --> 00:26:55.730
record that I was quite careful
to invoke,

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.688
that I was quite careful to
follow in some places,

00:26:59.688 --> 00:27:04.132
from which I got lots of detail
that I used in my novel:

00:27:04.132 --> 00:27:09.977
forget about that.
My novel stands on an equal

00:27:09.977 --> 00:27:15.339
plane of authority.
It gives me a platform to make

00:27:15.339 --> 00:27:19.726
equally valid claims of truth
about history and about the

00:27:19.726 --> 00:27:25.337
world."
This is a kind of grandiloquent

00:27:25.337 --> 00:27:32.190
argument for fiction as opposed
to history.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:40.733
On 309, we have another
interesting look back to the

00:27:40.733 --> 00:27:48.440
material that I was talking
about on Monday.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:52.959
This is when the kid is
dreaming about the judge while

00:27:52.959 --> 00:27:57.820
he's undergoing surgery for the
arrow wound in his leg.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:05.103
In that sleep and in
sleeps to follow the judge did

00:28:05.103 --> 00:28:07.480
visit.
Who would come other?

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.940
A great, shambling,
mutant, silent and serene.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.632
Whatever his antecedents,
he was something wholly other

00:28:16.632 --> 00:28:20.455
than their sum,
nor was there system by which

00:28:20.455 --> 00:28:24.886
to divide him back into his
origins for he would not

00:28:24.886 --> 00:28:27.647
go.
What does that mean,

00:28:27.647 --> 00:28:31.728
"There was no system by which
to divide him back into his

00:28:31.728 --> 00:28:36.210
origins for he would not go"?
What I did on Monday was

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:41.677
excavate some of the origins of
the judge as a figure in Ahab,

00:28:41.677 --> 00:28:46.262
in Milton's Satan.
This tells us--in the voice of

00:28:46.262 --> 00:28:49.686
the narrator,
this time--that you can't

00:28:49.686 --> 00:28:53.380
reduce his character to those
origins,

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:57.945
that to excavate the allusions,
or to note the literary

00:28:57.945 --> 00:29:01.920
tradition out of which such
characters arise,

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:08.356
does nothing to reduce the
singularity of McCarthy's

00:29:08.356 --> 00:29:12.912
artistic creation.
Even finding that eerily

00:29:12.912 --> 00:29:17.568
similar description of Judge
Holden in Sam Chamberlain's

00:29:17.568 --> 00:29:22.465
account,
McCarthy seems to be saying to

00:29:22.465 --> 00:29:30.000
us, doesn't reduce him to some
understandable character.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.625
That claim for the judge's
preeminence as a character is

00:29:34.625 --> 00:29:39.672
brought home to us at the very
end when the novel switches to

00:29:39.672 --> 00:29:44.550
the present tense and makes
these remarkable claims for the

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.479
judge.
And this is when they are

00:29:47.479 --> 00:29:52.086
dancing after the kid has been
killed in some horrific manner

00:29:52.086 --> 00:29:57.432
of which we're not told.
And here is the judge dancing,

00:29:57.432 --> 00:30:02.340
and you get the refrain that
"He never sleeps,

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:04.990
he says.
He says he'll never die."

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.490
He never sleeps, he says.
He says he'll never die.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.789
He bows to the fiddlers and
sashays backwards and throws

00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:13.549
back his head and laughs deep in
his throat.

00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:15.779
And he is a great favorite,
the judge.

00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:19.329
He wafts his hat and the lunar
dome of his skull passes palely

00:30:19.329 --> 00:30:22.704
under the lamps and he swings
about and takes possession of

00:30:22.704 --> 00:30:26.079
one of the fiddles and he
pirouettes and makes a pass,

00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:29.110
two passes, dancing and
fiddling at once.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:32.090
His feet are light and nimble.
He never sleeps.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.060
He says that he will never die.
He dances in light and in

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.190
shadow and he is a great
favorite.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:41.880
He never sleeps, the judge.
He is dancing, dancing.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:46.099
He says that he will never
die.

00:30:46.099 --> 00:30:50.390
The judge himself is a figure
for the artist.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.437
He's a music maker.
He's a performer,

00:30:53.437 --> 00:30:57.622
a dancer, in this passage,
but the assertion is that he

00:30:57.622 --> 00:31:00.359
will last forever.
And the only way,

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:03.951
I think, to understand that,
is to see him as a literary

00:31:03.951 --> 00:31:06.932
character.
Very self-consciously in this

00:31:06.932 --> 00:31:10.903
moment, that like Milton's
Satan, he's a character that

00:31:10.903 --> 00:31:15.898
will live in the tradition,
that will never die out in the

00:31:15.898 --> 00:31:20.410
imagination of readers.
It's a remarkably ambitious

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:23.619
claim to make for your own
character.

00:31:23.619 --> 00:31:26.413
But when you read it with that
passage I just read,

00:31:26.413 --> 00:31:29.319
about the impossibility of
dividing him back into his

00:31:29.319 --> 00:31:32.142
origins,
you begin to see McCarthy's

00:31:32.142 --> 00:31:35.569
literary ambition,
and that is to add to the

00:31:35.569 --> 00:31:41.173
tradition in a significant way.
McCarthy says about writing

00:31:41.173 --> 00:31:46.400
novels that it's not worth
doing--you cannot write a good

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.319
book--unless it's about life and
death.

00:31:50.319 --> 00:31:51.991
He dismisses,
for example,

00:31:51.991 --> 00:31:55.333
Proust and Henry James as
important writers on this

00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:59.077
ground, because they're not
writing novels about life and

00:31:59.077 --> 00:32:02.933
death.
I would argue that McCarthy

00:32:02.933 --> 00:32:10.058
needs his novel to be about life
and death because he is looking

00:32:10.058 --> 00:32:15.940
for the sound and the feel of
literary authority.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.609
In these passages,
I'm suggesting that it's a

00:32:19.609 --> 00:32:24.279
literary authority coming out of
a Miltonic tradition,

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:28.141
perhaps out of the tradition of
great American novels like

00:32:28.141 --> 00:32:30.851
Moby Dick,
but it goes much deeper

00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:34.649
than that,
and this is where I get to my

00:32:34.649 --> 00:32:39.956
original little detail of the
Bible, the illiterate kid

00:32:39.956 --> 00:32:47.513
holding the Bible.
248, we get a discussion among

00:32:47.513 --> 00:32:58.500
the men of the Bible in the
context of a discussion of war.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:02.510
This is what is said about it.

00:33:05.609 --> 00:33:08.880
This is Irving,
or, actually,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:13.319
first Black Jackson and then
Irving.

00:33:13.319 --> 00:33:16.819
"The good book says that
he that lives by the sword shall

00:33:16.819 --> 00:33:19.019
perish by the sword," said the
black.

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:21.339
The judge smiled,
his face shining with grease.

00:33:21.339 --> 00:33:23.110
"What right man would have it
any other way?"

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:26.390
he said.
"The good book does indeed

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.078
count war an evil," said Irving.
"Yet there's many a bloody tale

00:33:31.078 --> 00:33:36.100
of war inside it." 
I would argue that this is a

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.995
description of McCarthy's own
book, except there is one thing

00:33:41.995 --> 00:33:45.124
that's different.
The good book does,

00:33:45.124 --> 00:33:49.543
indeed, count war an evil.
McCarthy's novel does not fail

00:33:49.543 --> 00:33:54.887
in making us see war as evil,
because we're confronted over

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:59.309
and over again with these scenes
of violence,

00:33:59.309 --> 00:34:02.690
over and over again with its
gratuitous nature.

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:09.187
We feel the waste when that
last young boy is killed by the

00:34:09.187 --> 00:34:13.179
man.
We feel the waste of his life.

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:17.149
We feel the tragedy in
discovering that the sons of the

00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:21.413
harness maker and the sons of
the traveler both come to the

00:34:21.413 --> 00:34:24.280
same end and become killers of
men.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.608
We see that evil and,
like the Bible,

00:34:29.608 --> 00:34:35.530
there is many a bloody tale
within it.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:40.596
It does not count war an
evil, because it has not allowed

00:34:40.596 --> 00:34:45.340
a moral machinery to have a
place in this universe or in the

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:49.483
logic of the novel.
What it holds out instead is

00:34:49.483 --> 00:34:53.987
the feeling of morality,
the feeling that you could have

00:34:53.987 --> 00:34:58.492
a rhetoric that would divide the
kid from the judge in a

00:34:58.492 --> 00:35:02.655
meaningful way,
that would divide killers of

00:35:02.655 --> 00:35:07.977
men from not killers of men,
that would divide the good from

00:35:07.977 --> 00:35:12.592
the evil,
that would divide the peaceful

00:35:12.592 --> 00:35:18.126
from the warlike,
even that would divide history

00:35:18.126 --> 00:35:22.894
from fiction,
if there's something moral

00:35:22.894 --> 00:35:27.857
about the truth of history.
Why does McCarthy use the

00:35:27.857 --> 00:35:31.443
pattern and the sound of
biblical language throughout the

00:35:31.443 --> 00:35:34.469
novel?
I think this is why.

00:35:34.469 --> 00:35:38.435
Robert Alter--who,
if you've studied the Bible in

00:35:38.435 --> 00:35:42.401
any college course,
you've probably at least come

00:35:42.401 --> 00:35:48.019
to know his work--he is a great
translator of the Old Testament,

00:35:48.019 --> 00:35:52.627
and he came out recently with a
version--I think it was in

00:35:52.627 --> 00:35:56.750
2004--which he titles The
Five Books of Moses.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:02.001
It's the Pentateuch,
and it's retranslated in a very

00:36:02.001 --> 00:36:06.395
startling style.
It's trying to honor the syntax

00:36:06.395 --> 00:36:09.329
of the Hebrew,
which is paratactic,

00:36:09.329 --> 00:36:14.507
which means that it's strung
together with "ands" rather than

00:36:14.507 --> 00:36:18.563
subordinated the way that
Latinate languages are

00:36:18.563 --> 00:36:22.515
subordinated.
So, the King James Bible has,

00:36:22.515 --> 00:36:26.660
in the English tradition,
been the prestigious literary

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.475
translation of the Bible.
Alter, in 2004,

00:36:30.475 --> 00:36:36.250
tries to make the modern
equivalent of the King James

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:39.131
Bible.
And, in the introduction to

00:36:39.131 --> 00:36:42.337
that translation,
he says that what he's trying

00:36:42.337 --> 00:36:46.380
to do is to take the innovations
of writers like Stein,

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:50.227
Faulkner, and--the only one
from the late twentieth century

00:36:50.227 --> 00:36:55.757
he mentions--McCarthy,
to make a Bible that is true to

00:36:55.757 --> 00:37:00.383
the Hebrew syntax.
This citation from Alter,

00:37:00.383 --> 00:37:05.039
this foremost scholar on the
Bible and biblical translation,

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:09.415
suggests just how successful
McCarthy has been in persuading

00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:13.420
the ear that he is writing
something like scripture.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:22.150
He has persuaded Alter's ear
that this book is the equivalent

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:27.252
of Hebrew prose.
He is so successful in doing

00:37:27.252 --> 00:37:31.329
that, that he can make these
gigantic claims.

00:37:31.329 --> 00:37:37.931
And I would point you back to
the beginning of the novel,

00:37:37.931 --> 00:37:43.516
the citation of his father,
the only line we get really

00:37:43.516 --> 00:37:47.126
about the kid's father:
"His father has been a

00:37:47.126 --> 00:37:50.179
schoolmaster.
He lies in drink.

00:37:50.179 --> 00:37:54.670
He quotes from poets whose
names are now lost."

00:37:54.670 --> 00:38:00.931
It's as if McCarthy is telling
us, "I'm erasing all that past

00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:05.210
that I'm invoking from the Bible
on up,

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:10.105
from the Bible to The Iliad,
to Milton,

00:38:10.105 --> 00:38:13.260
to Wordsworth,
to Melville.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.639
I'm invoking it all,
but forget all those names.

00:38:17.639 --> 00:38:22.709
Remember just one:
the judge or,

00:38:22.709 --> 00:38:28.693
better yet, McCarthy.
That's the one that you can

00:38:28.693 --> 00:38:32.631
remember."
So, McCarthy gives us the feel

00:38:32.631 --> 00:38:36.571
of scripture,
and yet he erases all that

00:38:36.571 --> 00:38:40.309
could be the content of
scripture.

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:45.994
That's why I am interested in
the Bible in the hand of an

00:38:45.994 --> 00:38:50.613
illiterate kid.
What is the Bible in the

00:38:50.613 --> 00:38:56.296
hand of an illiterate kid but
the symbol of that kind of

00:38:56.296 --> 00:39:00.574
narrative,
the symbol that there can be an

00:39:00.574 --> 00:39:05.780
authoritative narrative about
the nature of the world,

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.442
about all of history,
about its meaning,

00:39:09.442 --> 00:39:13.762
about its structure,
a book that can compel its

00:39:13.762 --> 00:39:17.181
readers,
that can speak to life and

00:39:17.181 --> 00:39:22.647
death in the most ultimate way,
but because it's in the hand of

00:39:22.647 --> 00:39:26.349
an illiterate person it cannot
be read?

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:30.637
So, what McCarthy is saying to
us in that tiny detail,

00:39:30.637 --> 00:39:34.519
is that the Bible is important
as an artifact,

00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:38.725
as a literary artifact,
proof that such narratives can

00:39:38.725 --> 00:39:41.466
exist.
And McCarthy sets out to

00:39:41.466 --> 00:39:44.625
produce one, and,
in keeping with the

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:49.771
illiterateness of the kid,
one that has no moral content

00:39:49.771 --> 00:39:54.526
at all, has only made claims
about the material of the

00:39:54.526 --> 00:39:59.730
universe and not the spiritual
quality of the universe,

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:05.310
and that persuades entirely by
the sound of rhetoric and the

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:10.985
structures that are familiar to
us from the narratives of our

00:40:10.985 --> 00:40:14.909
tradition.
That's the ambition of the

00:40:14.909 --> 00:40:17.477
novel.
I'm actually right on time,

00:40:17.477 --> 00:40:18.943
so I will stop there.

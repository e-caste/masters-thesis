00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:08.020
Prof: Okay let's get
started.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:18.164
It occurred to me over the
break that Goldman Sachs gets

00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:21.300
some bad press.
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.470
Is there--has anybody read the
piece in Rolling Stone?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.170
Okay can--these--where are the
hand microphones?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.040
Do we have the hand microphones?
 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.038
Student:  Yeah,
Matt Taibi of Rolling Stone

00:00:43.038 --> 00:00:46.138
called Goldman Sachs a--
I might get this quote wrong,

00:00:46.138 --> 00:00:49.156
but it's something along the
lines of "A great vampire

00:00:49.156 --> 00:00:52.331
squid relentlessly jamming its
blood funnel into anything that

00:00:52.331 --> 00:00:53.840
smells like money."
 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.910
Prof: I think that's an
exact quote.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.110
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.298
Prof: We should have
tried that out on Paolo.

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:08.412
Now it also reminds me of the
passage in Richard Posner's

00:01:08.412 --> 00:01:12.183
book,
to the effect that we can no

00:01:12.183 --> 00:01:17.593
more blame the financiers for
the wreckage of the credit

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:23.299
markets than we could blame a
lion for eating a zebra,

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.159
and there's an odd
discontinuity here.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:36.553
When you look at Goldman Sachs
internally, through the eyes of

00:01:36.553 --> 00:01:44.310
one of its very senior partners,
the ethical component is big.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.471
There's a huge component about
integrity and meeting one's

00:01:51.471 --> 00:01:59.012
obligations and delivering the
highest quality product on the

00:01:59.012 --> 00:02:03.367
market,
and at the same time,

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:10.965
Goldman is vulnerable to the
view that it took inordinate

00:02:10.965 --> 00:02:18.020
advantage of the taxpayers in
the recent debacle.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.938
Now how would they defend
themselves?

00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:26.861
They would say--one thing they
would say is,

00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:29.650
"We didn't want to take
the money.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.810
Hank Paulson told us we had to
take the money,"

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.460
because the stigma which would
otherwise fall on the banks

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.090
which took the money would cause
further disruption and meltdown;

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.818
that's one thing they would say.
 

00:02:46.818 --> 00:02:51.485
Another thing--well,
have you noticed what they're

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:56.151
doing to--in the way of
charitable activities just

00:02:56.151 --> 00:02:57.199
lately?
 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.990
Anybody notice the announcement?
 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:08.788
$500 million dollars in help to
10,000 small businesses.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:16.710
Does that strike you as a big
gesture or a little gesture?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:23.560
Tal, what do you think?
 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.590
Student:  Well as a
percent of their revenues,

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.328
profits, or even just the
amount they pay out in bonuses

00:03:30.328 --> 00:03:32.486
every year,
I would say that's a very

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:33.258
little gesture.
 

00:03:33.258 --> 00:03:34.830
Prof: That's a very
little gesture.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.628
I agree.
 

00:03:36.628 --> 00:03:42.014
From a public relations point
of view, if they multiplied it

00:03:42.014 --> 00:03:47.310
by ten so it's five billion,
would it do them more good?

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.119
Them, not the world,
not the country,

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.860
them.
 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.603
Student:  I think that
adding a couple more zeroes

00:03:54.603 --> 00:03:57.690
would probably make a bit of a
difference in public opinion,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.403
but I don't know if it would
fully make up for the perceived

00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:06.878
damage that they caused in the
public's consciousness.

00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:12.034
Prof: Okay so my own
intuition is that it wouldn't do

00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:13.870
them a lot of good.
 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.129
That the public doesn't think
quantitatively,

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.831
some opinion leaders do,
but most people $500 million

00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:26.889
sounds like an awful lot of
money and five billion doesn't

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.543
sound like ten times as much,
so they're probably not far off

00:04:31.543 --> 00:04:35.940
in the number they chose if the
object is public relations,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.670
which I think it is.
 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:44.470
How many--are there people here
who think that the government

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.560
ought to compel them to give
back a bigger chunk of capital,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.427
put it out there in some
charitable way or give it back

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:57.139
to the taxpayers.
 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:01.959
Anybody of that view?
 

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:08.810
Okay so you're unanimous which
is rare in a group this size.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.699
Does that mean that you think
there's no ought to it,

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:18.120
or does it mean that the
process by which the government

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.819
would do that strikes you as not
a good one?

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:30.879
Who's got a--rescue me here
guys I'm drowning.

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.745
Student:  There is a big
difference between what you

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:34.420
should do and what the
government can make you do.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.483
I don't think that there's any
reason any large corporation

00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:39.649
should be forced to donate to
charity,

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:43.709
unless it's like a sort of ad
hoc tax randomly applied to

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:45.415
them,
and that seems like a

00:05:45.415 --> 00:05:46.810
&gt;
 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.009
and we don't want to go there.
 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.608
Prof: Okay so it
probably would violate the

00:05:52.608 --> 00:05:58.519
Constitution if we created The
Goldman Sachs Retribution Act.

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:01.240
I agree with that.
 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.338
So we're coming to the end of
the course,

00:06:06.338 --> 00:06:11.990
and what I want to do is today
to add one more case,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:17.019
one which allows us to look at
the interface between capital,

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:22.913
the environment,
and government in the TXU

00:06:22.913 --> 00:06:27.218
v.
EDF case which you've

00:06:27.218 --> 00:06:33.196
all looked at and which is
structured so that you could

00:06:33.196 --> 00:06:40.170
invest a whole week in it if you
were willing to trace out every

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.269
strand in the web page.
 

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:49.680
Then on Wednesday I'm going to
do a recap of the course,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:57.036
as if on a motorcycle,
and finish with a central case

00:06:57.036 --> 00:07:04.819
which will form the basis for
your final exam essay,

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:08.040
and since it's going to count
for 70% of the final,

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.228
I'm sure we'll have 100%
attendance during the last

00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:19.370
twenty minutes of class,
and I'll give you the reading

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.019
assignment in advance.
 

00:07:22.019 --> 00:07:26.620
It is the--Leasing the Rain,
it's the--

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.976
the reading is the William
Finnegan piece from The New

00:07:30.976 --> 00:07:34.555
Yorker about the
privatization of the water

00:07:34.555 --> 00:07:39.093
supply of Cochabamba,
Bolivia by an American

00:07:39.093 --> 00:07:42.519
corporation known as Bechtel.
 

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:47.673
And the essay question--I'll
formulate it at the end of class

00:07:47.673 --> 00:07:51.264
Wednesday,
asks you to work through that

00:07:51.264 --> 00:07:55.363
story as somebody who has
learned something about

00:07:55.363 --> 00:07:57.839
capitalism in this course.
 

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:04.725
Okay so now,
marrying the devil and the one

00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:14.399
difficulty with this case is
that it's full of acronyms,

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:18.341
and these are the most
important, or most immediately

00:08:18.341 --> 00:08:23.673
important of the acronyms,
and can anybody here quickly

00:08:23.673 --> 00:08:28.709
recite the full names of every
one of these?

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:35.000
Who wants to be a show off?
 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:41.168
I'm sure there are fifty people
who can do it.

00:08:41.168 --> 00:08:48.259
Okay I'll--let's put them into
three bins.

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:56.210
This is the most obscure,
Texas Climate Initiative,

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:02.336
and Jim Marsden who is the
video star of the case is

00:09:02.336 --> 00:09:08.658
president of that,
and he is the regional head of

00:09:08.658 --> 00:09:12.998
EDF,
The Environmental Defense Fund

00:09:12.998 --> 00:09:18.684
for Texas,
and The Natural Resources

00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:25.210
Defense Council is a--
is parallel to the EDF;

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:33.510
a little harder edge and
important--then in the gray box

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:42.417
in the middle we have the target
firms in the private equity

00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:44.379
takeover.
 

00:09:44.379 --> 00:09:51.355
It's just one firm really,
it's TXU, but the focus

00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:55.769
strategically is on TXU plus.
 

00:09:55.769 --> 00:10:02.731
It is on the expanded
generation capacity that TXU has

00:10:02.731 --> 00:10:07.881
announced,
and that expanded generation

00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:15.135
capacity is on the lower edge
from an environmental point of

00:10:15.135 --> 00:10:16.120
view.
 

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.970
It relies on conventional
technology,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:24.296
which no one thought at the
time, was the best available

00:10:24.296 --> 00:10:30.009
technology for coal-fired
generation of electric current.

00:10:30.009 --> 00:10:34.809
While we're at it,
the parts of an electric

00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:40.639
utility company are three:
generation, transmission,

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:44.070
and sales or distribution.
 

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.085
Transmission is the long lines,
and distribution is the last

00:10:49.085 --> 00:10:53.668
mile of lines,
and the financial connection,

00:10:53.668 --> 00:10:58.649
the contractual connection with
the customer.

00:10:58.649 --> 00:11:10.303
Then on the right we've got KKR
and TPG and these are both large

00:11:10.303 --> 00:11:18.259
and very aggressive private
equity firms.

00:11:18.259 --> 00:11:25.058
KKR is most famous for the
Reynolds/Nabisco,

00:11:25.058 --> 00:11:30.452
RJR Nabisco takeover,
which is characterized at

00:11:30.452 --> 00:11:37.486
length in Barbarians at the
Gate, and Texas Pacific is

00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:42.879
actually the more interesting of
the two,

00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:45.710
from the point of view of this
case.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:51.352
Is there anybody who can snap
to an obvious conclusion about

00:11:51.352 --> 00:11:54.509
the difference between the two?
 

00:11:54.509 --> 00:11:59.080
Okay we'll draw it out in a few
minutes.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:04.672
The TXU expansion 8,600
megawatts added,

00:12:04.672 --> 00:12:12.557
that's a--just under a 50%
increment to the firm's total

00:12:12.557 --> 00:12:16.000
generating capacity.
 

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.149
Ten or $11 billion dollars in
costs,

00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:27.066
somewhere between $50 billion
and $2 billion of that are

00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:31.720
budgeted to controls of
pollution,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.774
and it's pretty murky in the
case and pretty murky in fact

00:12:35.774 --> 00:12:39.916
just how much of it--
how much of the capital can be

00:12:39.916 --> 00:12:42.590
construed as pollution control.
 

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:48.403
They promise a 20% cut in
emissions--what do they mean by

00:12:48.403 --> 00:12:49.129
that?
 

00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:51.620
Who thought that one through?
 

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:56.625
20% cut in emissions,
we're going to add 47% to our

00:12:56.625 --> 00:13:01.432
total generating capacity,
and we're going to cut

00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:06.240
emissions by 20%,
what exactly is the claim?

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:12.808
Does it mean--yes.
 

00:13:12.808 --> 00:13:15.014
Student:  I'm not sure
what TXU promised exactly,

00:13:15.014 --> 00:13:16.658
but there are two ways you can
do that.

00:13:16.658 --> 00:13:20.307
You can artificially--you can
buy carbon credits and reduce

00:13:20.307 --> 00:13:23.139
your emissions,
like, technically on paper.

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:27.269
You can also retrofit some coal
plants and see--

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:31.639
so that emissions are kind of
sequestered underground,

00:13:31.639 --> 00:13:33.586
like there are certain
technologies that allow you to

00:13:33.586 --> 00:13:34.910
do that,
so that's some ways that you

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.529
can cut emissions.
 

00:13:35.529 --> 00:13:38.740
Prof: Okay.
 

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:43.187
Those are both valid points,
but I'm still a little unclear

00:13:43.187 --> 00:13:48.019
about how much soot is going to
come out the end of the pipe.

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:49.558
Yes.
 

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:54.395
Student:  I guess the
other potential difference is

00:13:54.395 --> 00:13:59.486
whether the 20% cut is in total
emissions or if it's per unit

00:13:59.486 --> 00:14:02.448
generated,
so if it's per unit generated

00:14:02.448 --> 00:14:06.058
there would still be a larger
final percentage of emissions,

00:14:06.058 --> 00:14:09.149
but it would be like less per
unit.

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:12.570
Prof: Yeah I think it
has to be normed in that way.

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:17.014
It has to be a unit rate of
emission so that these plants

00:14:17.014 --> 00:14:19.461
are,
on average, quite a lot better

00:14:19.461 --> 00:14:23.558
than the old plants,
though still not state of the

00:14:23.558 --> 00:14:29.164
art, and the claim is that we're
going to drive the aggregate

00:14:29.164 --> 00:14:33.090
emission rate per megawatt down
by 20%.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:35.580
They're using old sites.
 

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:38.116
They plan to use old sites
where they've already got a

00:14:38.116 --> 00:14:38.500
plant.
 

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:45.360
Anybody figure out why they
would say a thing like that?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:51.570
Well--yes.
 

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:54.423
Student:  If you're
building a new site it requires

00:14:54.423 --> 00:14:57.580
a lot more regulatory approval
to a green field site I guess.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:14:57.740
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.647
A green field site,
you've got a whole round of

00:15:00.647 --> 00:15:04.250
permitting, and there are a
couple of other advantages.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.136
One is that the NIMBY politics,
"not in my backyard

00:15:09.136 --> 00:15:12.870
politics,"
are over in those areas.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.677
You've already been through it,
and if you can come back to

00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:20.504
people and say,
"This is a less disruptive

00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:25.538
plant than the old one,"
that's a pretty good start,

00:15:25.538 --> 00:15:29.990
and even if people aren't much
taken by that,

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.432
if you've been--if the
management has been intelligent

00:15:34.432 --> 00:15:39.210
they will have built a network
of local relationships,

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.480
which they would have to build
anew on a green field site.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.990
Finally there's an
infrastructure reason,

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:51.280
that the transmission lines
required to transport the

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.860
current produced will already be
in place,

00:15:55.860 --> 00:16:00.480
and that's both an economic and
a political plus.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.721
Then at the end of this they
throw in a 10% discount to their

00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:07.836
customers,
and that discount is a

00:16:07.836 --> 00:16:12.528
non-sequitur in the
environmental discussion,

00:16:12.528 --> 00:16:15.308
but it's not a non-sequitur in
the actual case,

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:21.340
because TXU is in trouble on
two political fronts at once.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:29.360
It is a monopoly seller of
current and it has--

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.360
it is--it has wired the state
of Texas politically,

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.100
and there is a populist revolt
against that,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:45.460
and the populist revolt takes
the form of criticizing the

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.230
ultimate pricing at the
household level.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:52.538
Now if we look at the case from
Austin,

00:16:52.538 --> 00:16:55.798
Texas we've got all these small
things,

00:16:55.798 --> 00:16:58.460
upper right,
that are federal government,

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:04.407
and we've got all these big
things locally that are state

00:17:04.407 --> 00:17:07.170
politics and government.
 

00:17:07.170 --> 00:17:12.253
You've got Texas state
government where--how's TXU

00:17:12.253 --> 00:17:16.818
doing with Governor Perry during
all this?

00:17:16.818 --> 00:17:20.140
Is Perry a populist who wants
to beat up on them?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.920
No, they own Perry.
 

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.585
I may overstate a little but
they pretty much own Governor

00:17:28.585 --> 00:17:29.240
Perry.
 

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.997
The Texas Business for Clean
Air is a not all together

00:17:35.997 --> 00:17:43.902
surprising alliance of business
groups which are opposed to TXU

00:17:43.902 --> 00:17:47.242
on this,
on environmental grounds,

00:17:47.242 --> 00:17:50.746
sometimes for self serving
business reasons and other

00:17:50.746 --> 00:17:52.920
times,
I think, because it's what

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.940
senior management thinks is
right.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:00.567
You've got Texans for Public
Justice and they're not so much

00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:04.670
about the environment as about
the rates.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:10.902
You've got a state senator
named Troy Frazier who is making

00:18:10.902 --> 00:18:16.920
a name for himself statewide by
attacking TXU on the,

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.885
mostly on the rate side,
but he's also willing to take

00:18:21.885 --> 00:18:24.509
up the environmental side.
 

00:18:24.509 --> 00:18:27.901
You've got The Texas Climate
Initiative and the EDF,

00:18:27.901 --> 00:18:31.491
which are closely intertwined
in the personality of Jim

00:18:31.491 --> 00:18:32.289
Marston.
 

00:18:32.289 --> 00:18:34.358
What did you think of Marston?
 

00:18:34.358 --> 00:18:39.452
If you went all the way through
the case you've heard him,

00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:43.205
I don't know,
five or seven times in video,

00:18:43.205 --> 00:18:45.529
seem like an able guy?
 

00:18:45.529 --> 00:18:56.388
Thumbs up if you think that,
thumbs down if you don't think

00:18:56.388 --> 00:18:57.700
that.
 

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:07.019
Hmm...we've got ninety-five
abstentions.

00:19:07.019 --> 00:19:12.605
He's an able guy,
he's a very able guy,

00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:20.250
but he is a--he has a very soft
style of argument.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.700
He never seems to be a jump
ahead of you in the argument.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.328
He's also, in a very laid back
way,

00:19:27.328 --> 00:19:30.847
asking your opinion,
as if he hadn't really figured

00:19:30.847 --> 00:19:34.917
out where he wanted to go,
and that may be partly for our

00:19:34.917 --> 00:19:39.044
benefit because he was working
for the school of management in

00:19:39.044 --> 00:19:46.771
preparing for the case,
but it's also probably part of

00:19:46.771 --> 00:19:50.509
his natural style.
 

00:19:50.509 --> 00:19:59.632
PUCT, Public Utility Commission
of Texas, and Texas Commission

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:05.828
on Environmental Quality;
I almost missed that one myself.

00:20:05.828 --> 00:20:09.605
These are the two principle
regulatory bodies in the case

00:20:09.605 --> 00:20:12.910
and Association of Electric
Companies of Texas;

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:18.588
you can imagine who they are
and what the TXU's role is.

00:20:18.588 --> 00:21:16.634
It's a classic interest
association and then you got

00:21:16.634 --> 00:22:22.648
populist--[Video 20:35-22:50.]
Okay so any of you guys ever

00:22:22.648 --> 00:22:59.068
done a protest of that type?
 

00:22:59.068 --> 00:23:04.029
You just don't look like street
theatre types.

00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:08.019
Do you think that's effective?
 

00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:11.483
You're shaking your heads and I
think there are two sides to the

00:23:11.483 --> 00:23:12.088
question.
 

00:23:12.088 --> 00:23:18.048
Let's start in the negative
here.

00:23:18.048 --> 00:23:20.634
Student:  I mean,
I just feel as though it's not

00:23:20.634 --> 00:23:23.650
going to get the companies to
change their positions really,

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:26.819
so what's--I mean,
yes, it might stir up a little

00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:29.660
public disapproval for a couple
of days,

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:31.078
but that's not really going to
change behavior.

00:23:31.078 --> 00:23:35.551
Prof: Okay so as a
direct strategy for changing the

00:23:35.551 --> 00:23:38.769
behavior of companies,
it goes nowhere.

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:40.230
We agree.
 

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.990
Is there any other way in which
it might be of service to the

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.690
cause these people are pursuing?
 

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:51.838
Here and then here.
 

00:23:51.838 --> 00:23:54.118
Student:  If you can get
media coverage of it,

00:23:54.118 --> 00:23:56.222
it tends to have a more
dramatic effect on public

00:23:56.222 --> 00:23:56.750
opinion.
 

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.923
I was working on a political
campaign where we sent out

00:23:59.923 --> 00:24:04.323
something that was short enough,
a picture in The Washington

00:24:04.323 --> 00:24:08.750
Post, and so I at least from
personal experience,

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:11.318
think that it does have the
potential.

00:24:11.318 --> 00:24:16.051
Probably not to affect the
direct response of the people

00:24:16.051 --> 00:24:20.156
who you're calling out,
but that there can be larger

00:24:20.156 --> 00:24:23.759
implications for how other
people view the situation.

00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:28.534
Prof: Okay so the
clear--the media are the target

00:24:28.534 --> 00:24:33.480
and then who would we most
likely influence with this sort

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:34.608
of thing?
 

00:24:34.608 --> 00:24:40.059
Anybody want to elaborate
further?

00:24:40.059 --> 00:24:42.470
Yes, Sasha.
 

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.613
Student:  I think what
the companies really worry about

00:24:45.613 --> 00:24:48.448
is that they're clients are
going to be sensitive to the

00:24:48.448 --> 00:24:50.509
negative press and change
companies.

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:52.088
Prof: Absolutely.
 

00:24:52.088 --> 00:24:59.816
That's--TXU customer voter base
is part of this and both of

00:24:59.816 --> 00:25:06.018
those nouns are important,
and they are both voters and

00:25:06.018 --> 00:25:09.244
customers,
and they may not have many

00:25:09.244 --> 00:25:12.838
places to go as customers but as
voters,

00:25:12.838 --> 00:25:18.359
the perception within
regulatory and legislative

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:24.818
groups in Austin would be an
important consideration.

00:25:24.818 --> 00:25:29.921
I personally don't think that
this kind of demonstration is

00:25:29.921 --> 00:25:34.096
hugely effective,
but it does kind of raise the

00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:38.680
temperature of the issue and
make it salient to decision

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.680
makers in government.
 

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:45.890
Now in--on the--if we switch
from Austin to Washington,

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:52.640
the actors get to be different
and the EPA,

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.368
and The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission,

00:25:56.368 --> 00:26:03.486
and the key people in Congress
like Henry Waxman or Senators

00:26:03.486 --> 00:26:09.729
Bingaman and Boxer,
become big players,

00:26:09.729 --> 00:26:17.900
and the EDF and the NRDF,
Natural Resource Defense Fund,

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.048
become well staffed.
 

00:26:20.048 --> 00:26:25.269
They would each have fifty or
so staff people in Washington

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:33.060
and become a major presence,
and the question in front of

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:39.848
KKR and Texas Pacific hinges on
what?

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:43.777
Why do they--why are they
messing around with all these

00:26:43.777 --> 00:26:45.450
environmental groups?
 

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.452
It would sound like,
from a purely economic point of

00:26:49.452 --> 00:26:52.656
view,
to be a waste of time and yet

00:26:52.656 --> 00:26:57.190
from an entirely rational
economic point of view,

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:59.660
it isn't a waste of time.
 

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:05.990
Why not?
 

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.890
Well let's look--let's go to
Wall Street.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:15.451
The private equity business in
2007 there were 794 large

00:27:15.451 --> 00:27:21.180
private equity transactions
during that year,

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.781
adding up to about $800
billion, so they average about

00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:26.210
$1 billion a piece.
 

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:34.544
Explosive growth,
they're up about 450% to 500%

00:27:34.544 --> 00:27:40.715
from 2000 to 2007,
and it's a period when capital

00:27:40.715 --> 00:27:46.166
is abundant and cheap,
so the--it is in every sense

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:49.980
boom time for private equity.
 

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:58.688
The--you've got three sets of
players as seen from Wall

00:27:58.688 --> 00:28:00.140
Street.
 

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:04.630
You've got private equity
firms, the target firms,

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.858
and the business services
organizations,

00:28:07.858 --> 00:28:16.423
mainly investment banks which
catalyze transactions of this

00:28:16.423 --> 00:28:23.068
kind and the takeover of TXU is
a megadeal.

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:30.525
It is the biggest transaction
of its kind ever so it gets a

00:28:30.525 --> 00:28:37.210
lot of attention and offers to
be very profitable.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:43.040
The institutional investors,
shown upper left in the blue

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.474
box,
are limited partners in the

00:28:47.474 --> 00:28:55.710
funds created by organizations
like KKR and Texas Pacific,

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:01.984
and from their point of view,
this is one of the highest

00:29:01.984 --> 00:29:07.118
yielding asset classes in their
portfolio,

00:29:07.118 --> 00:29:11.460
and David Swenson,
for example of Yale,

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:16.085
one of the things he did with
the Yale portfolio which made it

00:29:16.085 --> 00:29:20.407
grow so much faster after he
came then it had grown at any

00:29:20.407 --> 00:29:23.288
time in the university's
history,

00:29:23.288 --> 00:29:28.887
was to shift a great deal of
capital away from publicly

00:29:28.887 --> 00:29:35.108
traded securities into private
equity funds which differ--

00:29:35.108 --> 00:29:40.240
they differ--the biggest
difference between how well

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.772
investment companies do with
stocks and bonds on the one

00:29:45.772 --> 00:29:48.856
side,
and private equity on the

00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:53.760
other, is the difference between
the smart money and average

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.509
money.
 

00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:58.383
In the stock market the
difference between very smart

00:29:58.383 --> 00:30:02.630
money and fairly dumb money is a
few percentage points.

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.657
The difference in private
equity between the smartest

00:30:06.657 --> 00:30:09.990
money and fairly dumb money is
enormous,

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:15.490
and so if an institutional
investor like Yale,

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:20.782
Harvard, or the big pension
funds, can get into private

00:30:20.782 --> 00:30:25.946
equity with smart money,
hire smart management,

00:30:25.946 --> 00:30:31.440
invest with people like Texas
Pacific and KKR,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:38.530
the opportunity to beat the
market in a big way is a very

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:44.230
ripe one and that's the heart of
this deal.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.788
Now from a sociological point
of view,

00:30:47.788 --> 00:30:56.710
the people who run these
companies are pretty far away

00:30:56.710 --> 00:31:02.826
from the green world,
which centers in major

00:31:02.826 --> 00:31:09.916
metropolitan areas,
and is populated by well to do

00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:14.857
activists,
and their 501(c)(3)

00:31:14.857 --> 00:31:21.568
corporations,
of which the ones in play today

00:31:21.568 --> 00:31:24.009
are examples.
 

00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:31.030
Now, the Pacific Group is a
little different from KKR in its

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:37.788
relationship to those groups,
because it has one key player

00:31:37.788 --> 00:31:43.230
in William Riley,
who had been the head of the

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:50.503
EPA before and who is agreeing,
and he gave--he gives Texas

00:31:50.503 --> 00:31:57.122
Pacific a relationship to this
world which KKR pretty much

00:31:57.122 --> 00:31:58.980
doesn't have.
 

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:03.217
David Bonderman,
who is one of the founders of

00:32:03.217 --> 00:32:07.453
Texas Pacific,
is Harvard educated and kind of

00:32:07.453 --> 00:32:09.618
part of this world.
 

00:32:09.618 --> 00:32:13.930
If you begin tracking
personalities in these funds,

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:20.210
Frances Beinecke,
she of Yale fame,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:27.410
is the head of Natural
Resources Defense Fund--

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.481
I don't know why I put C's
instead of F's on the end of

00:32:29.481 --> 00:32:31.400
this--
the slides.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:38.665
She's the head of that,
and a terrifically potent

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:42.238
leader,
and the reason the privileged

00:32:42.238 --> 00:32:46.710
access to do this case came to
the Yale School of Management,

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:52.180
has something to do with that
particular connection.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:58.670
There is a cultural divide
here, it is--

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:06.127
these are quite different views
of the world and if we compare

00:33:06.127 --> 00:33:13.710
501(c)(3) corporations with
regular public or not publicly--

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:17.109
publicly traded or not publicly
traded corporations,

00:33:17.109 --> 00:33:20.380
we get some sharp contrasts.
 

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:25.180
The business corporations are
pursuing profit.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:31.500
The 501(c)(3)'s are pursuing a
cause.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:38.050
The attitude to risk is far
more aggressive among the

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:39.690
businesses.
 

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:44.535
The boards are accountable to,
mainly to major investors on

00:33:44.535 --> 00:33:51.271
the business side,
and to donors on the 501(c)(3)

00:33:51.271 --> 00:33:59.910
side except that in the really
big old 501(c)(3)'s;

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:03.220
they're accountable to no one
because the donor is dead.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.430
The Carnegie Corporation,
for example,

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.070
where my wife is a chief
investment officer,

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.619
Andrew Carnegie hasn't paid any
attention to their ledgers in

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:15.472
some time,
and it actually creates an

00:34:15.472 --> 00:34:23.179
enormous amount of free play at
top management and board levels.

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:27.286
The management culture on the
business side is far more

00:34:27.286 --> 00:34:31.159
aggressive than on--
among the non-profits and top

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:36.614
management compensation in--
particularly in private equity

00:34:36.614 --> 00:34:40.630
is high and variable and Jim
would--

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:45.246
Jim pointed out to me that--Jim
Alexander pointed out to me this

00:34:45.246 --> 00:34:49.864
morning that when I say high and
variable the variability may or

00:34:49.864 --> 00:34:53.309
may not be well-tied to actual
performance.

00:34:53.309 --> 00:34:57.023
You can get a lot of
compensation for just sitting in

00:34:57.023 --> 00:35:01.309
the right chair during a bull
market and many people have.

00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:06.668
On the non-profit side it--the
compensation is relatively

00:35:06.668 --> 00:35:11.739
modest and more or less
invariant with performance.

00:35:11.739 --> 00:35:15.744
Take for instance,
Beinecke, there was a to do in

00:35:15.744 --> 00:35:19.500
this same year because somebody
published--

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:24.170
their top salaries are also
published and her salary of

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:29.400
$252,000 was published,
and there was a populist outcry.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:35.860
Now by private equity standards
that's not a lot of money.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.791
Even by not--people on the
investment side in organizations

00:35:39.791 --> 00:35:43.795
like this make three or four,
or ten times that,

00:35:43.795 --> 00:35:47.980
but the general norm in
non-profits is--

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:52.686
how many--are there people here
who plan to become

00:35:52.686 --> 00:35:54.320
non-profiteers?
 

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.960
Maybe?
 

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:01.824
Okay, well the one thing you
have to do is take a zero off

00:36:01.824 --> 00:36:05.530
when you think about
compensation.

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:11.257
More or less it's--that's about
the ratio and its considerable,

00:36:11.257 --> 00:36:16.710
so these are two very different
classes or organizations.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:23.068
Here we have Fred Krupp of The
Natural Resources and Henry

00:36:23.068 --> 00:36:29.983
Kravitz, and I'll bet not one of
you is in doubt about which is

00:36:29.983 --> 00:36:31.099
which.
 

00:36:31.099 --> 00:36:37.306
The pictures are--they get the
point across,

00:36:37.306 --> 00:36:46.112
and why on earth would people
on this side be so interested in

00:36:46.112 --> 00:36:52.320
participation from people on
this side?

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:59.190
Sasha, again.
 

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:02.025
Student:  If you ask
them to do something with the

00:37:02.025 --> 00:37:04.353
business that makes them more
money ultimately,

00:37:04.353 --> 00:37:05.670
then it's a good deal.
 

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:10.715
Prof: You nailed it,
and not one iota of direct

00:37:10.715 --> 00:37:16.239
concern for the environment is
required to back that up.

00:37:16.239 --> 00:37:18.380
Right?
 

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.440
So what's the biggest problem
about TXU?

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:26.987
Why is it--what--if you're
going to sit down and calculate

00:37:26.987 --> 00:37:32.242
the risks from KKR and Texas
Pacific's point of view of

00:37:32.242 --> 00:37:38.389
taking over this firm,
what would the main risks be?

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:42.110
They would be--would they be
that the technology will fail?

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:48.574
Would they be that consumer
demand for electric power will

00:37:48.574 --> 00:37:50.730
suddenly go away?
 

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:54.909
Would they be that a new
entrant will come in;

00:37:54.909 --> 00:37:59.708
a large new entrant will come
in, and begin to compete with

00:37:59.708 --> 00:38:00.949
lower prices?
 

00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:05.559
None of those things are
imaginable.

00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:08.139
None of those are imaginable.
 

00:38:08.139 --> 00:38:12.630
So why isn't this just a
license to print money?

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:19.373
The answer to that is that the
regulatory risk is substantial

00:38:19.373 --> 00:38:23.869
at both the federal and state
levels,

00:38:23.869 --> 00:38:27.559
much more substantial at the
federal level,

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:38.201
and that the process by which
the environmental groups would

00:38:38.201 --> 00:38:49.202
in effect bless or kosher the
transaction is a way of limiting

00:38:49.202 --> 00:38:52.630
political risk.
 

00:38:52.630 --> 00:39:00.998
The EDF is all about the cause
of the environment and their

00:39:00.998 --> 00:39:09.224
claim is that lobbying work
they've done in the years from

00:39:09.224 --> 00:39:17.304
2001 to 2008 will diminish
diesel pollution by nearly 90%

00:39:17.304 --> 00:39:21.969
by 2030,
and that's their business.

00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:31.623
Their business is to get the
government to compel companies

00:39:31.623 --> 00:39:34.619
to pollute less.
 

00:39:34.619 --> 00:39:37.449
Fred Krupp at Davos in the year
of the case,

00:39:37.449 --> 00:39:40.639
this is not in the case:
"The smartest companies

00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:44.260
can see over the horizon and
anticipate consumer demands.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.110
That's why the EDF has been
able to team with--

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.219
team up with ALCOA,
DuPont, Caterpillar,

00:39:50.219 --> 00:39:53.920
GE, Duke Energy,
BP America, and others on a

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:59.085
plan that could cut greenhouse
gas emissions by 60% to 80% by

00:39:59.085 --> 00:39:59.860
2050.
 

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.793
The plan is a jobs winner as
well as an environmental

00:40:02.793 --> 00:40:03.639
winner."
 

00:40:03.639 --> 00:40:11.048
So organizations like these are
brokers in which they cut deals

00:40:11.048 --> 00:40:16.023
with businesses,
and the businesses they cut the

00:40:16.023 --> 00:40:21.518
deals with are ones which have a
higher than average capacity to

00:40:21.518 --> 00:40:24.309
withstand tighter regulation.
 

00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:27.434
For example,
GE with Eco Imagination,

00:40:27.434 --> 00:40:29.780
you've all heard of that?
 

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:34.396
If you watch television for any
period as long as an hour you

00:40:34.396 --> 00:40:39.320
have been saturated with that
message, and why can GE do that?

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:41.239
Well why does it have to do it?
 

00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:46.686
What's GE's long-term
reputation for environmental

00:40:46.686 --> 00:40:48.018
pollution?
 

00:40:48.018 --> 00:40:51.295
It is that they filled the
Hudson River with PCB's fifty

00:40:51.295 --> 00:40:54.001
years ago,
and it's important to them to

00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:57.733
get us off that topic and to
think of them in a different

00:40:57.733 --> 00:40:58.199
way.
 

00:40:58.199 --> 00:41:01.936
Second, they compete in Europe
for the manufacture of

00:41:01.936 --> 00:41:05.820
electrically powered equipment,
and the regs in Europe are much

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.840
tighter than they are here from
an environmental point of view,

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:13.094
so they have developed a
technology to meet much higher

00:41:13.094 --> 00:41:14.039
standards.
 

00:41:14.039 --> 00:41:19.342
They've got it already in the
kit, and so from their point of

00:41:19.342 --> 00:41:24.822
view, it is actually a corporate
strategy play to encourage the

00:41:24.822 --> 00:41:27.119
feds to raise the bar.
 

00:41:27.119 --> 00:41:31.739
Cap and trade,
I'm running out of time here,

00:41:31.739 --> 00:41:37.956
cap and trade diagram--the
interesting side fact that cap

00:41:37.956 --> 00:41:42.510
and trade in the EU basically
fizzled,

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:49.894
and it fizzled because the caps
that were put on the countries

00:41:49.894 --> 00:41:57.159
were not low enough to make
people go out and buy credits.

00:41:57.159 --> 00:42:03.108
They were set in a very gentle
political way and the market for

00:42:03.108 --> 00:42:09.152
cap and trade depends on people
having to break the caps and buy

00:42:09.152 --> 00:42:16.193
credits to make up for that,
and the caps were set so high

00:42:16.193 --> 00:42:21.940
that it didn't produce the
desired effect.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.320
I don't know why that slide is
there.

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:32.320
Now let's think about outcomes.
 

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.119
We've got on the vertical
dimension,

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:37.878
Green World,
and on the horizontal dimension

00:42:37.878 --> 00:42:42.503
Green Paper,
and the four big quadrants--the

00:42:42.503 --> 00:42:48.489
four quadrants of this space
define points we could think

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:54.797
about in looking at what the
risks and possibilities of this

00:42:54.797 --> 00:42:59.929
are for these two classes of
organizations.

00:42:59.929 --> 00:43:05.074
Down here, emissions are high
and profits are low is a

00:43:05.074 --> 00:43:10.800
catastrophe on both dimensions
and the likelihood of both of

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.780
those things happening is very
small.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:22.833
The story where you have both
high emissions and high profits,

00:43:22.833 --> 00:43:30.228
this is the most worrying
category from the point of view

00:43:30.228 --> 00:43:32.210
of the EDF.
 

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:36.856
This would constitute green
washing which has become a

00:43:36.856 --> 00:43:42.380
really important epithet in the
politics of the environment,

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.873
where they're blessing
something which is a pretend

00:43:46.873 --> 00:43:52.210
benefit to the environment,
and here is the disaster from

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:56.309
the point of view of KKR and
Texas Pacific,

00:43:56.309 --> 00:44:02.981
where you have both low
emissions and low profits and do

00:44:02.981 --> 00:44:10.137
you think KKR and Texas Pacific
enter into this relationship

00:44:10.137 --> 00:44:17.173
fearing the risk that EDF and
The Natural Resources Defense

00:44:17.173 --> 00:44:22.996
Fund will encourage the
imposition of standard so

00:44:22.996 --> 00:44:28.820
Draconian that they can't make a
living?

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:34.896
Well no, they wouldn't have
chosen EDF as the lead agency if

00:44:34.896 --> 00:44:41.387
EDF were of the same temperament
as the street theatre we saw in

00:44:41.387 --> 00:44:42.829
the video.
 

00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:48.172
They chose EDF because they
think they can cut a plausible

00:44:48.172 --> 00:44:52.860
and constructive bargain with
them which leads,

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.079
not upper left but upper right
in the diagram,

00:44:56.079 --> 00:45:08.106
for emissions decrease in a
substantial degree and profits

00:45:08.106 --> 00:45:11.059
remain high.
 

00:45:11.059 --> 00:45:15.713
This slide is in the--is from
the case and it's the full

00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:20.960
inventory of exactions that Jim
Marston and EDF people consider

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.818
in looking at the case,
and they call it the blue sky

00:45:25.818 --> 00:45:28.646
concessions,
because it's perfectly clear

00:45:28.646 --> 00:45:30.969
they're not going to get all of
these,

00:45:30.969 --> 00:45:35.429
but they want some of them and
they get some of them,

00:45:35.429 --> 00:45:40.342
and they also get quite a lot
of symbolic buy in so that by

00:45:40.342 --> 00:45:44.425
the current year 2009,
KKR is offering an investment

00:45:44.425 --> 00:45:47.610
portfolio which it calls the
green portfolio,

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:52.614
and this consists not of
companies that are going to

00:45:52.614 --> 00:45:58.210
devote themselves to producing
environmental products,

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:01.690
but rather to companies which
produce other products.

00:46:01.690 --> 00:46:05.548
For example,
in Biomet, produce medical

00:46:05.548 --> 00:46:11.846
devices but where they sign onto
the proposition that they will

00:46:11.846 --> 00:46:18.550
make their production process
far greener than it was before,

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:23.500
so that I as an investor can
buy into the green fund,

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:29.251
and expect market rates of
return and think that on the

00:46:29.251 --> 00:46:35.429
side I'm doing a little bit of
good for the environment.

00:46:35.429 --> 00:46:57.822
[Video 46:37-47:08.]
Okay so--and they all went to

00:46:57.822 --> 00:47:15.190
the beach and had a swell
afternoon.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:21.630
The--okay so that's the last
case we're going to do,

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:26.427
except the one for your final,
and what I hope you'll do for

00:47:26.427 --> 00:47:30.820
Wednesday is read the Finnegan
piece with some care.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.949
He's a brilliant writer.
 

00:47:32.949 --> 00:47:36.282
I got to know him personally
when he came to write about

00:47:36.282 --> 00:47:39.070
violent kids in New Haven twenty
years ago,

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:45.331
and it's a beautifully written
piece and it's a compelling

00:47:45.331 --> 00:47:48.485
story,
and also begin reviewing your

00:47:48.485 --> 00:47:51.920
notes for the big picture flow
of the course.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:58.000

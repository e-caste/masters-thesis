00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.290
Prof: Let's get started.
 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.280
Welcome to the parents who've
made it today.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.568
Thank you for sending us your
bright people to pay our

00:00:12.568 --> 00:00:16.010
salaries and learn from us.
 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.454
We've spent most of the
semester so far figuring out

00:00:19.454 --> 00:00:22.021
what bond is,
and how quantum mechanics

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.440
works, and so on.
 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.180
But now we're trying to find
out how it really happened --

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.690
how people discovered how
chemistry in general,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.810
and organic chemistry in
particular, worked.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.830
And we started with Lavoisier.
 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.950
And now we're in the next
generation, which is Berzelius

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.850
in Sweden.
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.980
And, as we said last time,
he was important for analysis.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.890
He got good atomic weights for
fifty elements.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.670
We'll talk today about
electrolysis and dualism.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.900
He was important for his
teaching and writing.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.583
For the first half of the 19th
Century he was the main man in

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.664
chemistry;
and his notation for

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:03.270
composition that we talked about
last time, that we still use.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.738
Okay, so now we're going to
talk about atomic weights and

00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:09.340
equivalents and what was
involved there.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.817
We started this last time;
remember, showed how Gay-Lussac

00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:15.140
had an alternative to Dalton.
 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.810
There was this question about
what,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.610
even if you knew the proper
ratios of elements,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.248
what you didn't know was the
ratios of the atoms that were in

00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:26.840
them,
because you didn't know whether

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.680
an atomic weight should be
doubled or halved.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.921
So they had the question about
Silicon Chloride,

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.440
was it SiCl,
SiCl_2.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.620
SiCl_3, SiCl_4?
 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.170
So how could you possibly
settle something like this?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.465
Dalton did it by assuming that
if you had only one compound,

00:01:43.465 --> 00:01:45.360
it had to be one-to-one.
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.572
Gay-Lussac went with the
volumes of the gases that were

00:01:49.572 --> 00:01:51.779
involved,
which turned out ultimately to

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:54.072
be correct,
although it wasn't really

00:01:54.072 --> 00:01:56.790
widely accepted for about sixty
years.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.781
But there was another neat way
of doing it, depending on

00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:00.379
crystals.
 

00:02:00.379 --> 00:02:02.819
Mitscherlich,
an Austrian,

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:08.187
had this device on which you
mount a crystal and reflect

00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:11.800
light off it through a
telescope.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.080
So when you do that,
you know precisely --

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.878
if it comes right up the middle
of the telescope,

00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:20.994
you know exactly what direction
the plane of that surface of the

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:22.050
crystal is.
 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.395
So what you can do then is
rotate it by a certain number of

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:28.485
degrees,
until some other face of the

00:02:28.485 --> 00:02:32.745
crystal reflects precisely,
and then you can measure very,

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:36.120
very accurately what the angle
between those two faces is.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.420
So that was crystallography,
in those days,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.599
before X-ray.
 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.160
Okay?
 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.681
So here's his paper on
"Relating Crystal Shape to

00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:46.610
Chemical Proportions."
 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.780
They sound like not closely
related phenomena.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.240
But here's he's talking about
arsenates and phosphates.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.447
And here, the pictures he drew
-- they drew beautiful pictures

00:02:57.447 --> 00:03:00.633
of crystals in those days;
if that's all you can do,

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:01.800
you do it right.
 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.465
But he saw that those crystals
were the same shape for

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:08.370
corresponding arsenates and
phosphates,

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.342
this diammonium biarsenate and
the diammonium biphosphate.

00:03:13.342 --> 00:03:14.039
Right?
 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.060
So he measured the angles.
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.889
And here's his table of the
angles corresponding.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.128
And you can see they're very,
very close to one another.

00:03:20.128 --> 00:03:22.788
Those are the differences in
tenths of degrees.

00:03:22.788 --> 00:03:25.658
So these crystals are precisely
the same.

00:03:25.658 --> 00:03:28.800
Now what could he conclude from
that?

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.970
Anybody got an idea,
where you can go from here?

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.721
So you know that there's an
arsenate and a phosphate with

00:03:39.721 --> 00:03:42.265
the same chemical composition.
 

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:43.030
Right?
 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.810
And they give exactly the same
shape.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.125
So the things that pack
together must be exactly the

00:03:48.125 --> 00:03:48.580
same.
 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.818
So they must have the
corresponding number --

00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:52.318
however many arsenates there
are --

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:55.657
arsenic atoms there are in one,
there must be exactly the same

00:03:55.657 --> 00:03:58.008
number of phosphorous atoms in
the other.

00:03:58.008 --> 00:04:00.705
Otherwise they could not
possibly be exactly the same

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:01.120
shape.
 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.258
So now you know something.
 

00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:05.699
There was this need for
relative atomic weights.

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:06.560
Was Dalton right?
 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.590
Was water HO?
 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.224
Or was Gay-Lussac right,
that it was H_2O?

00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:10.740
Right?
 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.990
At least in this case,
this thing called isomorphism,

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.665
the same shape of the crystals,
provided definitive atomic

00:04:17.665 --> 00:04:21.019
weight ratios for at least some
of the atom pairs.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.639
So arsenic atoms must play
exactly the same role in

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:26.470
arsenates that phosphorous atoms
play in phosphates.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.516
And therefore,
if you have 100 grams of

00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:31.672
nitrogen,
oxygen and hydrogen,

00:04:31.672 --> 00:04:33.819
that combines to give these
salts,

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:38.581
with 30.64 grams of
phosphorous, or 78.11 grams of

00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:42.065
arsenic,
it must be that arsenic atom is

00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:45.418
2.55 times as heavy as the
phosphorous atom.

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:46.120
Right?
 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.470
That is, it can't be half that,
or twice that.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.841
It has to be exactly that,
because there have to be the

00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:53.819
same number to give exactly the
same shape.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:54.279
Okay?
 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.910
So there was one way of
determining this ratio.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.300
But it wasn't trivial.
 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.940
Okay?
 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.074
Now here's Berzelius's Table of
atomic and molecular weights

00:05:03.074 --> 00:05:04.189
from the year 1831.
 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:06.699
And if we zoom in on it a bit
here,

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.730
you can see he gave two columns
for the atomic weights,

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.689
one based on oxygen being 100
units,

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:16.370
and the other based on H,
with a bar across it,

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.329
being one.
 

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:20.610
Now, the bar across atoms means
that the atoms are doubled.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.120
You can have it without a bar,
which is a single atom;

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.310
or the bar across,
that means it's a doubled atom.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.918
So he had -- actually you
notice, if you can go down the

00:05:29.918 --> 00:05:32.608
column there,
that if you assume H_2 as 1,

00:05:32.608 --> 00:05:34.641
then obviously H here is a
half.

00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:35.430
Right?
 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.180
So these were the numbers he
had in 1831.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.041
And we could compare them with
what they would be nowadays,

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:45.971
if you scaled to oxygen,
as we define it now,

00:05:45.971 --> 00:05:47.170
to be 15.9994.
 

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.358
And then you see that they're
off by about 1%,

00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:51.279
up or down.
 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.569
How does that compare with what
Dalton was getting?

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:56.529
Do you remember how accurate he
was?

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.509
He was about 10%.
 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.456
So here in twenty-five years
they've gotten tenfold more

00:06:02.456 --> 00:06:05.470
accurate in what the atomic
weights are.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.370
Okay?
 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.810
Now, combustion analysis was,
and would continue to be,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.218
from the time of Lavoisier,
right through the whole

00:06:14.218 --> 00:06:18.259
nineteenth century,
the heavy carrier for organic

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:19.389
chemistry.
 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.470
Okay, here's the way Berzelius
did combustion analysis.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.415
So he started with a tube in
which he put half a gram of

00:06:27.415 --> 00:06:30.788
organic substance that was going
to be analyzed,

00:06:30.788 --> 00:06:33.300
three grams of sodium chlorate.
 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.324
Remember, that's what
Gay-Lussac used to burn things

00:06:36.324 --> 00:06:36.740
with.
 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.529
Why that rather than air?
 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:41.500
Why did Gay-Lussac use it
rather than air?

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.120
Do you remember?
 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.370
Because a lot of things
wouldn't burn in air,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.779
right?
 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.300
They would char.
 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.720
Okay, so but they used
Gay-Lussac's oxidizing agent.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.560
And fifty grams of sodium
chloride was ground up with this

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.399
stuff, just so that the reaction
wouldn't get out of hand,

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:00.220
so it wouldn't explode.
 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.509
Okay, so those were put in
there.

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:05.968
Then he heated up the neck and
drew it out, and plugged it into

00:07:05.968 --> 00:07:07.622
that bulb on the right.
 

00:07:07.622 --> 00:07:08.269
Right?
 

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:10.305
So he joined it to that bulb,
which would serve for

00:07:10.305 --> 00:07:12.802
collecting water,
which is a combustion product,

00:07:12.802 --> 00:07:14.879
and a calcium chloride drying
tube,

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.952
which would get the rest of the
water that didn't condense in

00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:19.699
the bulb.
 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:20.360
Okay?
 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.442
Then he assembled this thing
along the bottom so that the

00:07:24.442 --> 00:07:27.964
gases that came out,
after the water was removed,

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:31.060
would exit and be collected in
this bell jar,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.290
over mercury.
 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.692
And in that,
there was a bulb that floated,

00:07:34.692 --> 00:07:38.101
which held potassium hydroxide;
solid potassium hydroxide,

00:07:38.101 --> 00:07:41.497
which would absorb the CO_2,
thereby separating it from the

00:07:41.497 --> 00:07:43.490
oxygen that would come through.
 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.959
You get oxygen just by heating
sodium chlorate.

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:47.410
Okay?
 

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.346
And then he closed the top with
a piece of glove leather so that

00:07:50.346 --> 00:07:52.286
mercury,
that it was floating on,

00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:54.000
couldn't --
little drops of mercury

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.740
wouldn't get in.
 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.673
Because, as you know,
from hefting it,

00:07:56.673 --> 00:07:58.920
that would change the weight a
good deal.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.990
Okay?
 

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.620
So what he did was build a fire
and move that barrier back,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.180
so it would heat from one end
to the other,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.290
and the gases would come out
and bubble up in the bell jar,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:12.180
and fill up a good deal of the
bell jar.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:12.980
Right?
 

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.081
And notice that the tube had
been wrapped with metal to keep

00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:20.350
it from popping when it got hot
in the fire,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.942
because there'd be pressure
inside in order to bubble

00:08:22.942 --> 00:08:24.040
through the mercury.
 

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.310
Okay, so then he cools it off.
 

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.350
The gas contracts. Right?
 

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.320
The KOH absorbs CO_2.
 

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.596
So you're left with oxygen in
the bell jar,

00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:39.808
and the CO_2 is absorbed on the
potassium hydroxide.

00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:44.940
But he then -- so the mercury
rises as the gas gets absorbed.

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:47.178
But after the mercury stops
rising,

00:08:47.178 --> 00:08:50.634
he waits twelve hours to make
sure he's got all the CO_2

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:52.596
absorbed,
because it has to get through

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:53.679
the glove leather,
right?

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:54.750
So it takes quite a while.
 

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.980
It took much more than a day to
do an analysis.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.238
So after it stops rising,
he takes it apart,

00:09:01.238 --> 00:09:03.653
takes the glove leather off the
top, weighs it,

00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:05.860
and finds out how much CO_2
there was.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.330
So he's got the water and the
CO_2,_;

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:08.830
therefore the hydrogen
and the carbon.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.597
And this was a much better way
of doing it than Lavoisier's,

00:09:12.597 --> 00:09:15.982
which required three or four
people operating that big

00:09:15.982 --> 00:09:16.750
machine.
 

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.610
Okay.
 

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:23.244
Electricity was another really
important contribution from

00:09:23.244 --> 00:09:24.220
Berzelius.
 

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.000
Okay?
 

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.943
But it also was a contribution
at the Royal Institution in

00:09:29.943 --> 00:09:34.541
London where -- this is a
demonstration of N_2O at the

00:09:34.541 --> 00:09:36.450
Royal Institution.
 

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.984
But the guy holding the bellows
there is Humphry Davy,

00:09:41.984 --> 00:09:46.577
who became the head of the
Royal Institution,

00:09:46.577 --> 00:09:50.860
and was the head then of big
science.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.788
So in 1807 and '8,
he made some very important

00:09:53.788 --> 00:09:54.700
experiments.
 

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.658
It was based on the work of
Volta, who was just a little

00:09:58.658 --> 00:10:02.399
more than a decade earlier,
who had invented this thing,

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:06.282
shown on his desk here,
which was the Voltaic Pile,

00:10:06.282 --> 00:10:10.220
which was a pile of copper and
zinc discs.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.734
And when you put copper and
zinc together,

00:10:12.734 --> 00:10:14.820
you can get 1.1 volts out of
it.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.590
Okay?
 

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.288
So this was going to be big
science.

00:10:17.288 --> 00:10:21.111
So he put together twenty-four
such pairs of things,

00:10:21.111 --> 00:10:24.408
which meant he could get
twenty-six volts.

00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:26.601
Those were six inches square.
 

00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:27.129
Right?
 

00:10:27.129 --> 00:10:30.677
Then he made another -- there's
the battery, incidentally,

00:10:30.677 --> 00:10:33.789
that Berzelius had,
which is still in Stockholm.

00:10:33.789 --> 00:10:34.259
Okay?
 

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:37.995
Then he put one with 100 such
things, so he could get 110

00:10:37.995 --> 00:10:38.529
volts.
 

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:39.808
Then he made another one.
 

00:10:39.808 --> 00:10:41.399
They were only four inches
square.

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:44.908
Now 165 volts, right?
 

00:10:44.908 --> 00:10:47.940
And then he could hook them
together in series.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.678
So he could get 301 volts
across this thing.

00:10:50.678 --> 00:10:53.840
And then he tried doing
experiments with it.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.413
So this is what he said:
"I acted upon aqueous

00:10:58.413 --> 00:11:02.529
solutions of potash and
soda…."

00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:04.668
You know what potash is?
 

00:11:04.668 --> 00:11:05.139
Student: 
&gt;

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:08.442
Prof: Potassium
hydroxide, and soda is sodium

00:11:08.442 --> 00:11:09.220
hydroxide.
 

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.710
"…saturated at
common temperatures,

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.278
by the highest electrical power
I could command,

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:16.369
and which was produced by a
combination of voltaic batteries

00:11:16.369 --> 00:11:18.360
belonging to the Royal
Institution,

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.850
containing twenty-four plates
of copper and zinc,

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.168
twelve inches square,
100 plates of six inches,

00:11:23.168 --> 00:11:25.778
and 150 of four inches
square."

00:11:25.778 --> 00:11:27.668
So this is that battery I
showed you.

00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:30.923
So he put
300-and-whatever-number of volts

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:32.509
across this thing.
 

00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:35.710
"Though there was a high
intensity of action,

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.980
the water of the solution alone
was affected,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.730
and hydrogen and oxygen
disengaged with the production

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.169
of much heat and violent
effervescence."

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.389
I can believe that.
 

00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:47.419
And so he wasn't about to give
up.

00:11:47.419 --> 00:11:48.450
He tried again.
 

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:50.827
"The presence of water
appearing thus to prevent any

00:11:50.827 --> 00:11:52.548
decomposition,
I used potash"

00:11:52.548 --> 00:11:55.490
(so potassium hydroxide)
"in igneous fusion."

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:58.000
(So he put a flame to it and
melted it.)

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.081
"By means of a stream of
oxygen gas from a gasometer

00:12:01.081 --> 00:12:03.340
applied to the flame of a spirit
lamp,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.820
which was thrown on to a
platina spoon containing potash,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.470
this alkali was kept for some
minutes in a strong red heat,

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.830
and in a state of perfect
fluidity.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.452
The spoon was preserved in
communication with the positive

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:19.140
side of the battery"
I don't know how he held this

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.480
thing.
 

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.009
&gt;
 

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:23.980
"of the power of 100 of 6
inches, highly charged;

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.477
and the connection from the
negative side was made by a

00:12:27.477 --> 00:12:28.450
platina wire.
 

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.937
By this arrangement,
some brilliant phenomena were

00:12:31.937 --> 00:12:32.720
produced.
 

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.029
The potash appeared a conductor
in a high degree,

00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:36.908
and as long the communication
was preserved,

00:12:36.908 --> 00:12:40.038
a most intense light was
exhibited at the negative wire,

00:12:40.038 --> 00:12:42.619
and a column of flame,
which seemed to be owing to the

00:12:42.619 --> 00:12:44.418
development of combustible
matter,

00:12:44.418 --> 00:12:46.828
arose from the point of
contact."

00:12:46.828 --> 00:12:47.350
Right?
 

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.470
Then he did another experiment.
 

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:49.870
"A small piece of pure
potash,

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.658
which had been exposed for a
few seconds to the atmosphere,

00:12:51.658 --> 00:12:54.360
so as to give a conducting
power to the surface,

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.308
was placed upon an insulated
disc of platina,

00:12:57.308 --> 00:13:01.071
connected with the negative
side of the battery in the power

00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:04.210
of 250 of 6 and 4,
in a state of intense activity;

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:06.964
and a platina wire,
communicating with the positive

00:13:06.964 --> 00:13:10.104
side, was brought in contact
with the upper surface of the

00:13:10.104 --> 00:13:10.710
alkali.
 

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.942
…small globules having a
high metallic luster,

00:13:13.942 --> 00:13:17.115
and being precisely similar in
visible characters to

00:13:17.115 --> 00:13:18.669
quick-silver..."
 

00:13:18.669 --> 00:13:19.990
What's quick-silver?
 

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.769
Live silver, right?
 

00:13:21.769 --> 00:13:22.960
Mercury, of course.
 

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.950
Okay?
 

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.563
"…some of which
burnt with explosion and bright

00:13:26.563 --> 00:13:27.982
flame,
as soon as they were formed,

00:13:27.982 --> 00:13:29.875
and others remained,
and were merely tarnished,

00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:32.321
and finally covered with a
white film which formed on their

00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:33.080
surfaces."
 

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.529
What was this?
 

00:13:35.529 --> 00:13:40.929
He electrolyzed -- here he says
potash, potassium hydroxide.

00:13:40.929 --> 00:13:41.620
What did he get?
 

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.220
Student:  Potassium.
 

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.009
Prof: Potassium metal.
 

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:45.590
So he discovered a new element.
 

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:53.019
And from soda he got sodium;
from potash he got potassium.

00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:56.090
Okay, now this was a great
triumph for English science.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.190
But this was a period of great
rivalry, 1807 and ‘8.

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.985
The Peninsular War was going on
in Portugal, Spain,

00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:06.879
against the French;
in particular, against Napoleon.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:09.586
Now Napoleon had studied
science a certain amount as a

00:14:09.586 --> 00:14:12.090
student at the École
Militaire in Paris.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.889
In fact, he had been examined
by Laplace, Lavoisier's

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:19.658
colleague in measuring heat.
 

00:14:19.658 --> 00:14:23.950
So he wasn't about to knuckle
under to England in this.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.601
So he got his crew together,
including Gay-Lussac,

00:14:26.601 --> 00:14:29.580
and said, "Why haven't we
discovered this?"

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:31.642
And Gay-Lussac said,
"We don't have the

00:14:31.642 --> 00:14:32.408
battery."
 

00:14:32.408 --> 00:14:34.288
He says, "You've got your
battery."

00:14:34.288 --> 00:14:38.038
So this was the battery that
Gay-Lussac constructed

00:14:38.038 --> 00:14:39.090
accordingly.
 

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:42.447
* So it
consisted of 600 one-kilogram

00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:45.620
copper plates and 600
three-kilogram zinc plates.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:51.190
So he had 2.6 tons of metal and
in six different troughs here.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:53.340
And then he hooked them
together in series.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:57.840
&gt;
 

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.710
So he's now got 650 volts.
 

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.220
Now, Napoleon was interested in
science.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.918
So he came to visit the lab one
day.

00:15:04.918 --> 00:15:09.542
And there's an account of this
in the biography of Humphry

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:10.110
Davy.
 

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:13.003
"With that rapidity,
which characterized all his

00:15:13.003 --> 00:15:15.517
motions,
and before the attendants could

00:15:15.517 --> 00:15:19.102
interpose any precaution,
he thrust the extreme wires of

00:15:19.102 --> 00:15:22.558
the battery under his tongue and
received a shock,

00:15:22.558 --> 00:15:25.259
which nearly deprived him of
sensation.

00:15:25.259 --> 00:15:29.123
After recovering from its
effects, he quitted the

00:15:29.123 --> 00:15:31.572
laboratory,
without making any remark,

00:15:31.572 --> 00:15:34.730
and was never afterwards heard
to refer to the subject."

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.470
&gt;
 

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.903
Okay, so that was the end of
the French competition with

00:15:39.903 --> 00:15:40.840
Humphry Davy.
 

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:45.179
But Davy himself built one with
1000 plates;

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:47.139
so 2200 volts.
 

00:15:47.139 --> 00:15:49.759
And with this he was able to
prepare a bunch of elements.

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:52.596
In addition to sodium and
potassium, boron,

00:15:52.596 --> 00:15:56.380
magnesium, calcium and barium
were all due to Sir Humphry

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:56.990
Davy.
 

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.230
But that wasn't really the most
important thing for chemistry.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.426
It supplied more than new
elements, it supplied an idea,

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:06.912
and the idea was the organizing
principle for what was called

00:16:06.912 --> 00:16:07.610
dualism.
 

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.500
And dualism was the idea that
there were things that were

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.392
positive and things that were
negative, and they would be

00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:14.889
attracted to one another.
 

00:16:14.889 --> 00:16:18.061
Not only would they be
attracted to one another,

00:16:18.061 --> 00:16:20.220
but they could trade partners.
 

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.009
Okay?
 

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:25.197
So remember we saw last time
that the alchemists already had

00:16:25.197 --> 00:16:28.320
vitriolum cupri,
or copper sulfate.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.230
So here we saw last time was
copper sulfate.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:44.750
Let me see if I can get this
thing going here There we go.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:48.538
So there's copper sulfate,
nice and blue.

00:16:48.538 --> 00:16:51.340
Let me get the light behind,
that should be good.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.450
Okay, so we'll put some in here.
 

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:58.029
So this is copper as a positive
stuff, and sulfate as negative

00:16:58.029 --> 00:16:58.629
stuff.
 

00:16:58.629 --> 00:17:08.508
And now we'll take sodium
hydroxide, and put a little bit

00:17:08.508 --> 00:17:09.390
in.
 

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.028
So there's a precipitate.
 

00:17:12.028 --> 00:17:14.570
And actually it's much more
complicated than people thought

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:15.578
it was in those days.
 

00:17:15.578 --> 00:17:19.700
It gets quite dark blue of you
put a lot in there.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.337
But now a whitish precipitate
is going to form,

00:17:22.337 --> 00:17:24.460
which you don't see very well
here;

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:29.890
maybe it doesn't know how to
focus on that.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:36.630
So it needs something for it to
focus on.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.349
There.
 

00:17:37.349 --> 00:17:38.160
There you see the precipitate.
 

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.717
Okay, so obviously something
happened.

00:17:40.717 --> 00:17:41.269
Right?
 

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:44.431
And according to Dualism,
this is what happened.

00:17:44.431 --> 00:17:44.970
Right?
 

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.220
You mix it with caustic soda
and you have AB and CD;

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.913
positive and negative on the
left, sodium hydroxide,

00:17:50.913 --> 00:17:53.025
copper sulfate,
and they change partners,

00:17:53.025 --> 00:17:54.608
and you get a precipitate.
 

00:17:54.608 --> 00:17:57.000
So you have -- and it's
explained by electricity.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.308
And this then is what dualism
was.

00:17:59.308 --> 00:18:04.317
So, notice that this is our
family tree, you'll remember,

00:18:04.317 --> 00:18:08.071
and now we've looked at
elemental analysis,

00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:10.038
atoms and dualism.
 

00:18:10.038 --> 00:18:12.009
Notice that people are entered
into this,

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:14.250
not by when they made their
contribution,

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.650
because they made it at many
different times,

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.368
but by when they were born.
 

00:18:17.368 --> 00:18:20.108
So you can see what the
generations were.

00:18:20.108 --> 00:18:22.308
So first we had Lavoisier,
then Berzelius.

00:18:22.308 --> 00:18:25.200
And now we're into a new
generation of people who are

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.479
going to contribute when they
get to be 20,30-years-old down

00:18:28.479 --> 00:18:28.980
here.
 

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.132
So the next thing we're going
to talk about is urea and

00:18:33.132 --> 00:18:36.976
isomers, and the benzoyl
radical, and the theory of

00:18:36.976 --> 00:18:39.130
substitutions and types.
 

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.480
Okay?
 

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.861
And our players are
Jean-Baptiste André

00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:47.317
Dumas, in France,
and Liebig and Wöhler in

00:18:47.317 --> 00:18:48.220
Germany.
 

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.460
And they were all born right
around 1800;

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.119
between 1800 and 1803.
 

00:18:52.119 --> 00:18:52.900
Okay.
 

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:56.578
And here they are on the
outside of the building.

00:18:56.578 --> 00:18:58.940
So we're going to look at
Wöhler and Liebig.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.895
Now, here's Wöhler,
writing to Berzelius in Sweden

00:19:02.895 --> 00:19:04.317
--
he's going to be the next

00:19:04.317 --> 00:19:06.605
generation --
saying, "Having developed

00:19:06.605 --> 00:19:10.028
the greatest respect for you
through studying your writings,

00:19:10.028 --> 00:19:12.770
I have always thought it would
be my greatest good fortune to

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:15.557
be able to practice this science
under the direction of such a

00:19:15.557 --> 00:19:17.403
man,
which has always been my

00:19:17.403 --> 00:19:18.720
fondest desire."
 

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.859
Those who have seen such
letters will recognize that

00:19:21.859 --> 00:19:24.568
these as consistent up to the
present day.

00:19:24.568 --> 00:19:26.805
He goes on to say:
"Although I earlier had

00:19:26.805 --> 00:19:29.039
planned to become a
physician…".

00:19:29.039 --> 00:19:29.960
Okay?
 

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.788
And at the end he says,
"With the greatest

00:19:32.788 --> 00:19:36.599
respect, Friedrich Wöhler
from Frankfurt am Main."

00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:37.480
He was a great guy.
 

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.494
They carried on a
correspondence their whole

00:19:39.494 --> 00:19:41.669
lives;
it's really entertaining,

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:45.770
partly because Wöhler had
sort of a lame-ish sense of

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.930
humor and was a cartoonist.
 

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.740
So, for example,
in this letter to Berzelius in

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.519
1837 --
so this is ten years later --

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:55.790
he said,
"To see this old friend

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.451
again,
especially here ,

00:19:57.451 --> 00:19:58.900
was a real delight.
 

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.664
He was just the same old guy,
with the sole exception that he

00:20:01.664 --> 00:20:03.970
no longer wears the little
toupee swept up over his

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.630
forehead as he used to do."
 

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.528
So Wöhler drew this
cartoon in there.

00:20:08.528 --> 00:20:11.583
Okay, but what you know
Wöhler for,

00:20:11.583 --> 00:20:13.150
probably, is urea.
 

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.319
How many people have heard
about Wöhler and urea?

00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:16.848
Okay.
 

00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:20.163
But the interesting thing is
that the urea was not the main

00:20:20.163 --> 00:20:21.019
contribution.
 

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:23.057
He also invented aluminum
incidentally,

00:20:23.057 --> 00:20:24.400
or discovered aluminum.
 

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.042
But urea wasn't really the
main, for our purposes,

00:20:28.042 --> 00:20:32.578
wasn't the main contribution
from this work of Wöhler.

00:20:32.578 --> 00:20:35.652
And you'll see that there are a
couple of problems for next

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:38.405
Wednesday, and readings on the
web that support this,

00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:39.890
with original documents.
 

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.469
So he wrote in 1828 to
Berzelius: "Perhaps you

00:20:42.469 --> 00:20:45.565
still remember the experiment I
carried out in that fortunate

00:20:45.565 --> 00:20:49.202
time when I working with you,
in which I found that whenever

00:20:49.202 --> 00:20:52.088
one tries to react cyanic acid
with ammonia,

00:20:52.088 --> 00:20:55.269
a crystalline substance appears
which is inert,

00:20:55.269 --> 00:21:00.118
behaving neither like cyanate
nor like ammonia."

00:21:00.118 --> 00:21:03.346
So that's what was funny,
that it didn't behave like you

00:21:03.346 --> 00:21:05.460
would expect for ammonium
cyanate.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:08.442
So the idea was it should be a
double decomposition reaction,

00:21:08.442 --> 00:21:10.930
this dualistic thing,
where you change partners.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.920
So you start with ammonium
chloride,

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.930
silver cyanate -- that was
another way he did it --

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:19.029
and you should get ammonium
cyanate and silver chloride,

00:21:19.029 --> 00:21:19.788
which is a precipitate.
 

00:21:19.788 --> 00:21:22.118
So then you've prepared
ammonium cyanate.

00:21:22.118 --> 00:21:25.559
But you can test whether
ammonium cyanate is the

00:21:25.559 --> 00:21:27.088
salt ammonium cyanate.
 

00:21:27.088 --> 00:21:29.920
One is to see whether it has
the ammonium ion in it,

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.383
and that you can tell by
pulling the proton off and

00:21:32.383 --> 00:21:36.410
changing it back into ammonia,
which you can smell.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.358
Okay?
 

00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:39.914
But when he treated it with
sodium hydroxide,

00:21:39.914 --> 00:21:41.309
he didn't get ammonia.
 

00:21:41.309 --> 00:21:42.230
Okay?
 

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:44.566
Or you can test…
So it doesn't behave like an

00:21:44.566 --> 00:21:45.298
ammonium salt.
 

00:21:45.298 --> 00:21:48.598
Nor did it behave like a
cyanate salt.

00:21:48.598 --> 00:21:53.141
If you treat it with acid you
don't get the smell of cyanic

00:21:53.141 --> 00:21:53.690
acid.
 

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:57.298
And if you treat it with lead,
you don't get lead cyanate.

00:21:57.298 --> 00:22:03.799
So it appears not to be either
ammonia or cyanic acid anymore.

00:22:03.799 --> 00:22:04.450
Okay?
 

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.578
But what it did do,
when treated with nitric acid,

00:22:07.578 --> 00:22:10.068
was to give brilliant crystal
flakes.

00:22:10.068 --> 00:22:12.880
So the crystals were what
allowed him to identify it.

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:17.438
And he knew that you got the
same thing when you treated urea

00:22:17.438 --> 00:22:20.932
with nitric acid,
just like those from urea and

00:22:20.932 --> 00:22:21.844
nitric acid.
 

00:22:21.844 --> 00:22:22.680
Right?
 

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.859
So this raised a question.
 

00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:27.433
Berzelius wrote to Wöhler,
in reply to that:

00:22:27.433 --> 00:22:30.877
"It is a unique situation
that the salt nature so entirely

00:22:30.877 --> 00:22:32.098
disappears"
--

00:22:32.098 --> 00:22:34.880
it doesn't look like dualism
anymore --

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.970
"when the acid and the
ammonia combine,

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:40.053
one that will certainly be most
enlightening for future

00:22:40.053 --> 00:22:40.910
theory."
 

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:45.990
So might ammonium cyanate
actually be urea?

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.470
Might urea be ammonium cyanate,
with very curious properties?

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.890
So Wöhler wrote back to
Berzelius: "I recently

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.233
performed a small experiment,
appropriate to the limited time

00:22:56.233 --> 00:22:57.368
I have available"
--

00:22:57.368 --> 00:22:59.608
he was doing a lot of teaching
at this time --

00:22:59.608 --> 00:23:01.200
"which I quickly completed
and which,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.750
thank God, did not require a
single analysis."

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.210
That was what was a pain in the
neck to do.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.532
So this is the data from
Wöhler's letter,

00:23:11.532 --> 00:23:15.670
and the same thing was
published as his paper in 1828.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:17.538
So it turned out that
Dr. Prout,

00:23:17.538 --> 00:23:21.420
a physician in London,
had already analyzed urea,

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.340
and reported its composition in
terms of nitrogen,

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.278
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen;
that is, its ultimate analysis.

00:23:28.278 --> 00:23:31.180
And Wöhler,
without doing an experiment,

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:36.058
knew what the analysis should
be for ammonium cyanate,

00:23:36.058 --> 00:23:39.538
because he had Berzelius's
atomic weights.

00:23:39.538 --> 00:23:42.421
So he could calculate for a
substance of that formula what

00:23:42.421 --> 00:23:44.140
the percent by weight should be.
 

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.746
And they agreed,
as you can see,

00:23:45.746 --> 00:23:46.680
very, very well.
 

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.964
So it looked like urea and
ammonium cyanate had the same

00:23:50.964 --> 00:23:54.549
analysis, and therefore were the
same thing.

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:55.220
Okay?
 

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.650
The discrepancies were less
than 2%.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.160
Remember, the atomic weights
were only good to about 1%.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.720
Okay, so therefore these things
appear to be identical.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.598
In fact, it's interesting to
compare them with the modern

00:24:07.598 --> 00:24:09.088
values, which you see here.
 

00:24:09.088 --> 00:24:10.380
What do you notice in the first
row?

00:24:23.348 --> 00:24:25.240
When you compare the numbers in
the first row?

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.500
Russell?
 

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:27.839
Student:  It seems like
they're much the same.

00:24:27.839 --> 00:24:29.048
Prof: What's the same?
 

00:24:29.048 --> 00:24:29.920
Student: The nitrogen
and --

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.779
Prof: Which is better,
experiment or theory?

00:24:33.779 --> 00:24:34.650
Student:  They're the
same.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:35.150
Prof: What?
 

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:36.858
Student:  They're the
same.

00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:37.558
Student:  Experiment is
better.

00:24:37.558 --> 00:24:39.773
Prof: No,
no, the first is Prout's

00:24:39.773 --> 00:24:42.673
analysis, the first column;
the last column is

00:24:42.673 --> 00:24:46.281
Berzelius-Wöhler theory;
and the middle is what we think

00:24:46.281 --> 00:24:48.720
is correct, because it's based
on what we have now.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.329
What do you say?
 

00:24:49.329 --> 00:24:49.920
Student:  The experiment.
 

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.130
Prof: Ah ha!
 

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.869
so there's a good lesson for
us.

00:24:52.869 --> 00:24:53.318
Right?
 

00:24:53.318 --> 00:24:56.660
Experiment is better than
theory.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.119
But if you look more closely,
there's a much more interesting

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:00.869
story here.
 

00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:04.407
So the moral is don't dry-lab;
don't be like Lavoisier and try

00:25:04.407 --> 00:25:07.143
to make your experiments conform
to theory.

00:25:07.143 --> 00:25:07.730
Right?
 

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.028
So, because of that,
Dr. Prout has a gotten a

00:25:11.028 --> 00:25:15.680
reputation among historians of
science as a paragon of accuracy

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.382
and honesty;
the very model for lab work.

00:25:19.382 --> 00:25:19.970
Right?
 

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:22.130
Okay, but let's look more
carefully.

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:25.619
You notice, for example,
that he didn't make these

00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:27.328
things add up to 100%.
 

00:25:27.328 --> 00:25:30.064
Would you expect them to --
what would happen if it had been

00:25:30.064 --> 00:25:32.289
Lavoisier doing it,
what would they add up to?

00:25:32.289 --> 00:25:32.920
Student:  100%.
 

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.759
Prof: 100%.
 

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:34.359
Exactly.
 

00:25:34.359 --> 00:25:35.220
Here it isn't.
 

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.420
Why not?
 

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.558
Student:  Being honest.
 

00:25:37.558 --> 00:25:40.589
Prof: Because he's been
honest; maybe.

00:25:40.589 --> 00:25:41.740
&gt;
 

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:42.088
Okay.
 

00:25:42.088 --> 00:25:45.798
So notice, incidentally,
that the theory didn't add up

00:25:45.798 --> 00:25:46.568
to 100%.
 

00:25:46.568 --> 00:25:48.440
Now how do you get those
numbers?

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.618
How would Wöhler have
gotten those numbers?

00:25:50.618 --> 00:25:53.525
He decided how many atoms of
nitrogen, hydrogen,

00:25:53.525 --> 00:25:55.690
oxygen there are in the
compound.

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.545
He'd see, according to the
atomic weights,

00:25:57.545 --> 00:25:59.220
how much each of those would
weigh.

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.589
He'd add them all together.
 

00:26:00.589 --> 00:26:01.278
That would be the total.
 

00:26:01.278 --> 00:26:05.292
And then he'd divide each one
by the total to get how many

00:26:05.292 --> 00:26:06.490
percent it was.
 

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.930
Is that clear to everyone,
how you go about it?

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.000
So how do you do that and not
get it to add to 100%?

00:26:18.528 --> 00:26:21.631
Well I recalculated it,
using Berzelius's numbers,

00:26:21.631 --> 00:26:23.150
and that's what I got.
 

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.009
Now you'll notice a couple of
things here.

00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:27.480
One, here, you'll notice what?
 

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.630
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.874
Prof: That he just
truncated numbers,

00:26:32.874 --> 00:26:34.180
he didn't round them off.
 

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:34.650
Right?
 

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:38.038
So it's always going to be low;
and indeed it is low, his sum.

00:26:38.038 --> 00:26:40.978
But that's not low enough.
 

00:26:40.978 --> 00:26:41.769
Right?
 

00:26:41.769 --> 00:26:46.420
What else do you notice?
 

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.130
Angela?
 

00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:49.368
Student:  He switched
them in the last --

00:26:49.368 --> 00:26:54.890
Prof: He switched the
numbers in the last row.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:56.088
He made an error.
 

00:26:56.088 --> 00:26:59.220
But the important thing is he
didn't notice he made the error.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:03.250
He added it up and saw that it
was 99.8, and thought,

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:05.730
well what the heck,
it's 99.8.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:09.740
Because this was early days of
doing this kind of stuff.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.240
Okay?
 

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.809
Now, so we come over to
Dr. Prout.

00:27:13.809 --> 00:27:16.660
Is this experimental candor?
 

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.902
Well you find out,
if you add the numbers,

00:27:18.902 --> 00:27:20.160
it's actually 99.945.
 

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.210
&gt;
 

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:22.240
He added wrong.
 

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.778
Okay?
 

00:27:24.778 --> 00:27:27.460
And now, but those things
really agreed.

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:28.009
Right?
 

00:27:28.009 --> 00:27:30.952
Now you wonder,
how did old Dr. Prout do

00:27:30.952 --> 00:27:33.743
this, to measure it to 1 part in
5000?

00:27:33.743 --> 00:27:34.650
Right?
 

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:38.459
It turned out he measured the
volume of the gas,

00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:42.348
and what he reported was 6.3
cubic inches of gas.

00:27:42.348 --> 00:27:43.160
Right?
 

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.814
So was he just lucky that it
happened to be right to four

00:27:46.814 --> 00:27:48.250
significant figures?
 

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.318
No.
 

00:27:49.318 --> 00:27:51.358
Because that's not how he did
the experiment.

00:27:51.358 --> 00:27:53.798
What he reported was not
actually experimental.

00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:56.608
He had a theory about atomic
weights.

00:27:56.608 --> 00:27:59.700
His theory was that everything
was made of hydrogen;

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.262
which isn't so far wrong in
terms of weight,

00:28:02.262 --> 00:28:02.740
right?
 

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.970
Because a proton and a neutron
have the same weight.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.210
A proton is hydrogen.
 

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.068
So everything is the sum of
protons and neutrons;

00:28:09.068 --> 00:28:11.769
for weight, the electrons don't
count for much.

00:28:11.769 --> 00:28:12.240
Right?
 

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.298
So it's not actually such a bad
theory.

00:28:15.298 --> 00:28:17.200
So in his system,
carbon was six,

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:19.220
oxygen eight,
nitrogen fourteen;

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.318
you know, that was what integer
you multiply them by.

00:28:22.318 --> 00:28:24.268
Incidentally,
hydrogen was called

00:28:24.268 --> 00:28:26.154
protyle,
from, let's see,

00:28:26.154 --> 00:28:28.894
from (hyle prote,
which means the first

00:28:28.894 --> 00:28:29.869
substance.
 

00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:30.890
Okay?
 

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:31.828
So he had this theory.
 

00:28:31.828 --> 00:28:34.420
So what he did was do
approximate analysis,

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.711
get about what the ratio is,
figure out what the ratio

00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:40.121
should be,
in terms of small whole

00:28:40.121 --> 00:28:43.950
numbers, and then multiply them
by his atomic weights.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.290
So these numbers are not really
experimental numbers,

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.220
they're more like Lavoisier.
 

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:50.288
All right?
 

00:28:50.288 --> 00:28:53.398
So what he said was,
it was one, one,

00:28:53.398 --> 00:28:56.940
two, one, and that gives those
numbers.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.470
Okay?
 

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.107
So Prout did dry-lab by
making an approximate analysis

00:29:01.107 --> 00:29:04.019
and reporting results corrected
by his theory.

00:29:04.019 --> 00:29:06.815
And so much for the paragon of
accuracy and honesty,

00:29:06.815 --> 00:29:08.348
as far as we would see it.
 

00:29:08.348 --> 00:29:15.009
Okay, but his theory was better
than Berzelius's experiments.

00:29:15.009 --> 00:29:19.009
That's interesting.
 

00:29:19.009 --> 00:29:21.858
Okay, so now ammonium cyanate
to urea.

00:29:21.858 --> 00:29:23.959
Let's review that,
from the point of view of what

00:29:23.959 --> 00:29:25.140
we've been talking about.
 

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.970
So you have ammonium.
 

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:32.319
What makes it reactive?
 

00:29:32.319 --> 00:29:35.690
Dana?
 

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:36.390
Student:  High HOMO.
 

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.858
Prof: High HOMO or low
LUMO?

00:29:38.858 --> 00:29:40.558
Student:  High HOMO and
--

00:29:40.558 --> 00:29:41.869
Prof: It's got a
positive charge.

00:29:41.869 --> 00:29:47.170
That's one clue.
 

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.190
Anybody got an idea?
 

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.890
John?
 

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:52.259
Student:  A low LUMO.
 

00:29:52.259 --> 00:29:55.346
Prof: And what do you
suppose that low LUMO is,

00:29:55.346 --> 00:29:57.269
in terms of localized orbitals?
 

00:29:57.269 --> 00:30:01.153
We're not going to talk about
things that go over the whole

00:30:01.153 --> 00:30:01.890
molecule.
 

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.430
There's not much to deal with
here in ammonium.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.558
Yoonjoo?
 

00:30:06.558 --> 00:30:12.930
Student:  The LUMOs from
the σ*,

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.118
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:30:15.118 --> 00:30:16.920
Student:  The LUMOs from
the σ*.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.309
Prof: σ* of
N-H.

00:30:18.309 --> 00:30:20.618
Okay, so that'll be the LUMO.
 

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:23.130
How about a HOMO on the other
side?

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.529
Student: Unshared pair.
 

00:30:25.529 --> 00:30:27.920
Prof: There's a hint.
 

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:30.190
Okay, the unshared pair on
nitrogen with a negative charge.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.009
Okay?
 

00:30:31.009 --> 00:30:33.710
So we've got these,
and we can do the

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.608
make-and-break trick,
attack the σ* with

00:30:37.608 --> 00:30:37.983
that.
 

00:30:37.983 --> 00:30:38.808
Right?
 

00:30:38.808 --> 00:30:42.352
So we've gotten back to ammonia
and cyanic acid,

00:30:42.352 --> 00:30:45.818
a possible starting place for
getting there.

00:30:45.818 --> 00:30:47.903
But if you have these two
things, you could react them

00:30:47.903 --> 00:30:48.650
with one another.
 

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:52.089
What makes ammonia reactive,
NH_3?

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:52.818
Student:  The high HOMO.
 

00:30:52.818 --> 00:30:54.359
Prof: The high HOMO,
the unshared pair.

00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:56.490
And how about the cyanic acid?
 

00:31:02.788 --> 00:31:05.519
What do you see there that
looks like a functional group?

00:31:05.519 --> 00:31:08.249
Don't worry too much about how
big it has to be,

00:31:08.249 --> 00:31:10.630
just see something that looks
familiar.

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:12.913
Prof: C=O double bond,
π*,

00:31:12.913 --> 00:31:13.348
right?
 

00:31:13.348 --> 00:31:16.691
Okay, now so we can -- so one
of these can attack the other,

00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:20.088
and we can arrange them like
that and draw a curved arrow.

00:31:20.088 --> 00:31:23.640
And we could attack the C=O
double bond.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.858
But you could also attack the
C=N double bond.

00:31:26.858 --> 00:31:30.490
And, in fact,
these aren't so different,

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.435
because when you attack one,
and make an unshared-pair on

00:31:33.435 --> 00:31:34.907
the other,
in this case,

00:31:34.907 --> 00:31:37.700
for example,
that high HOMO on the nitrogen,

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:42.059
the N^-, can be stabilized by
mixing with the π* of

00:31:42.059 --> 00:31:43.005
the carbonyl.
 

00:31:43.005 --> 00:31:43.660
Right?
 

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:47.769
So you could actually draw it
either way.

00:31:47.769 --> 00:31:50.088
So it really doesn't make any
difference which way you draw

00:31:50.088 --> 00:31:51.009
it, at the beginning.
 

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:55.339
But what you can do is then
have a further reaction,

00:31:55.339 --> 00:32:00.858
the HOMO on the bottom reacting
with the σ* again;

00:32:00.858 --> 00:32:03.603
although they probably can't
line up right,

00:32:03.603 --> 00:32:04.910
within a molecule.
 

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:08.854
It's probably one molecule
attacking another molecule to do

00:32:08.854 --> 00:32:09.329
this.
 

00:32:09.329 --> 00:32:09.710
Okay?
 

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.859
And get the hydrogen transfer.
 

00:32:10.859 --> 00:32:13.660
And that is urea.
 

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.130
Okay, so there's how you go
from ammonium cyanate to urea.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.210
It's quite an easy chain of
events.

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.509
You could've done it the other
way too, like that,

00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:23.528
and you'd get this compound.
 

00:32:23.528 --> 00:32:28.058
But those molecules,
the urea and this one,

00:32:28.058 --> 00:32:30.250
can lose a proton,
go back on, lose,

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.166
go back on, one side or the
other, and ultimately you get

00:32:33.166 --> 00:32:36.055
the one that's more stable,
which is the one that has the

00:32:36.055 --> 00:32:39.232
carbon oxygen double bond;
which is a very stable

00:32:39.232 --> 00:32:43.650
grouping, as we'll learn later,
in terms of lore.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:47.344
You can actually understand it
in terms of HUMO and LUMO mixing

00:32:47.344 --> 00:32:48.000
here too.
 

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.450
But at any rate,
that's what happened.

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:53.144
So the question arises,
can ammonium cyanate exist,

00:32:53.144 --> 00:32:55.140
or does it always change?
 

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:58.568
Is there such a salt,
or does it always change to

00:32:58.568 --> 00:32:59.068
urea?
 

00:32:59.068 --> 00:33:02.565
And in fact Dunitz,
our old pal and your

00:33:02.565 --> 00:33:06.356
great-uncle,
in 1998, with Kenneth Harris,

00:33:06.356 --> 00:33:10.662
did an X-ray structure that
showed that you can have

00:33:10.662 --> 00:33:12.348
ammonium cyanate.
 

00:33:12.348 --> 00:33:15.509
This was the first time it had
ever been proved to exist.

00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:17.670
And there's what it looks like.
 

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:21.409
But notice, the nitrogens,
on the ammonia there,

00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:24.990
point toward oxygens,
not toward nitrogens.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:28.073
So it's not -- from this
arrangement, you couldn't have

00:33:28.073 --> 00:33:31.556
done that thing that we -- the
mechanism that we drew in order

00:33:31.556 --> 00:33:33.269
to get from here to there.
 

00:33:33.269 --> 00:33:40.230
Okay, so but the fact of
getting urea,

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.993
a product of animal metabolism,
from purely (as far as they

00:33:44.993 --> 00:33:49.577
were concerned inorganic things,
which is said to have done away

00:33:49.577 --> 00:33:52.890
with the idea of vitalism,
was not, from my perspective,

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.210
the most important contribution
here.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.719
Because this is what
Wöhler wrote toward the end

00:33:57.719 --> 00:34:00.499
of that paper,
in 1828: "I refrain from

00:34:00.499 --> 00:34:04.214
all considerations which so
naturally suggest themselves

00:34:04.214 --> 00:34:06.038
from this fact,"
--

00:34:06.038 --> 00:34:09.961
that is, that ammonium cyanate
and urea have the same analysis

00:34:09.961 --> 00:34:12.266
--
"especially in respect to

00:34:12.266 --> 00:34:15.675
the composition ratios of
organic substances and in

00:34:15.675 --> 00:34:19.974
respect to similar elemental and
quantitative compositions among

00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:23.179
compounds with very different
properties,

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.235
as may be supposed,
among others,

00:34:25.235 --> 00:34:27.869
of fulminic acid and cyanic
acid."

00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:31.856
We already did those;
that was a problem early on

00:34:31.856 --> 00:34:36.300
when we were drawing Lewis
structures.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.809
So two different arrangements
of the same atoms.

00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:41.518
"…and of a liquid
hydrocarbon and the olefiant

00:34:41.518 --> 00:34:42.090
gas."
 

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.876
The olefiant gas,
the gas that will "make an

00:34:44.876 --> 00:34:48.070
oil", is ethylene,
CH_2CH_2.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:51.757
But that's very similar to the
-- that's exactly the same ratio

00:34:51.757 --> 00:34:54.971
of atoms as you have in a long
hydrocarbon, if it has a

00:34:54.971 --> 00:34:56.280
double-bond in it.
 

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.335
"It must be left to
further investigation of many

00:34:59.335 --> 00:35:02.505
similar cases to decide what
general laws can be defined

00:35:02.505 --> 00:35:03.659
therefrom."
 

00:35:03.659 --> 00:35:07.052
Now this is an interesting
point, because when people have

00:35:07.052 --> 00:35:09.987
certain tools available,
they tend to think that that's

00:35:09.987 --> 00:35:11.760
all the tools that could be
available,

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.784
and therefore it gives all the
information that's possible.

00:35:15.784 --> 00:35:16.340
Right?
 

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.581
So if what you can do is
elemental analysis,

00:35:18.581 --> 00:35:21.396
you think that once you have
the ratio of the elements,

00:35:21.396 --> 00:35:23.690
you know everything about the
substance.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:27.318
But what he shows here is that
there can be different

00:35:27.318 --> 00:35:30.666
substances that have the same
elemental analysis,

00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:33.110
like urea and ammonium cyanate.
 

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:37.387
So the possibility of isomerism
showed there was more to be

00:35:37.387 --> 00:35:41.222
known than people thought,
when all they could do was

00:35:41.222 --> 00:35:42.920
elemental analysis.
 

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.664
So fulminic and cyanic acid was
very important,

00:35:46.664 --> 00:35:49.268
as we'll see in just a second.
 

00:35:49.268 --> 00:35:51.960
Now Berzelius wrote a paper
just two years later,

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.889
in 1830, "On the
Composition of Tartaric

00:35:53.889 --> 00:35:56.443
Acid" --
remember we spoke before about

00:35:56.443 --> 00:36:00.110
how pervasive tartaric acid is
in the nineteenth century in the

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.300
development of organic
chemistry--

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.429
;"and Racemic
Acid" --

00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:07.530
also called John's Acid from
the Vosges--

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:09.750
;"on the Atomic Weight
of Lead Oxide,

00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.063
together with General Remarks
on Substances that have

00:36:12.063 --> 00:36:14.340
the Same Composition but
Different Properties."

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:18.500
So he found that tartaric acid,
and this John's acid from the

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:22.173
Vosges, also called racemic
acid, had exactly the same

00:36:22.173 --> 00:36:23.976
analysis, their salts did.
 

00:36:23.976 --> 00:36:24.739
Right?
 

00:36:24.739 --> 00:36:26.579
And here, in fact,
is a picture of it.

00:36:26.579 --> 00:36:30.119
I have the actual stuff right
here.

00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:37.827
This is from a cork from a wine
bottle, and on top of it here,

00:36:37.827 --> 00:36:40.860
if we're lucky -- see.
 

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:44.891
You can see those,
and that's -- we took one of

00:36:44.891 --> 00:36:48.309
the crystals and put it on the
X-ray.

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:49.190
There's what they look like.
 

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.119
They're beautiful little
crystals.

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:53.119
And they're calcium tartrate.
 

00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:56.418
So remember,
you get -- tartaric acid grows

00:36:56.418 --> 00:37:00.110
from tartar on the walls of the
wine barrels.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:01.679
But this is what was important.
 

00:37:01.679 --> 00:37:04.393
He wanted to give a name for
this phenomenon,

00:37:04.393 --> 00:37:07.416
things that had the same
analysis but were clearly

00:37:07.416 --> 00:37:08.280
different.
 

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.684
"I thought it necessary to
choose between the words

00:37:11.684 --> 00:37:13.480
homosynthetic and isomeric.
 

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.972
The former is built from
homos,

00:37:14.972 --> 00:37:16.224
equivalent and
synthetos,

00:37:16.224 --> 00:37:17.639
put together;
the latter from

00:37:17.639 --> 00:37:19.440
isomeres,
has the same meaning,

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.311
although it only properly says
put together from the same

00:37:22.311 --> 00:37:23.090
pieces.
 

00:37:23.090 --> 00:37:26.467
The latter has the advantage
with respect to brevity and

00:37:26.467 --> 00:37:27.449
euphony."
 

00:37:27.449 --> 00:37:29.969
So it's shorter and it sounds
-- it's easier to say.

00:37:29.969 --> 00:37:33.505
So from now on we're going to
choose "isomer"

00:37:33.505 --> 00:37:35.599
to talk about this phenomenon.
 

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:38.695
"By isomeric substances,
I understand those which posses

00:37:38.695 --> 00:37:40.875
the same chemical composition
and the same

00:37:40.875 --> 00:37:42.150
atomic…."
 

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.666
By that he means molecular
weight, but different

00:37:45.666 --> 00:37:46.639
properties.
 

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:47.855
Okay, so that's where
"isomers"

00:37:47.855 --> 00:37:48.219
came from.
 

00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:50.820
So it showed there was more to
be discovered.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:53.411
There must be something about
how these pieces are put

00:37:53.411 --> 00:37:54.780
together that's different.
 

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.487
But how can you possibly find
that out, just by doing

00:37:58.487 --> 00:38:00.769
reactions and weighing things?
 

00:38:00.769 --> 00:38:01.610
Okay?
 

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:04.389
Same chemical composition but
different properties.

00:38:04.389 --> 00:38:07.396
Okay, so there's more to
chemistry than the analytical

00:38:07.396 --> 00:38:10.630
composition, which is what they
were good at measuring.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.471
Now we know the importance of
atomic arrangement,

00:38:13.471 --> 00:38:14.360
or structure.
 

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:19.949
So there are four Cs that we'll
organize things about it:

00:38:19.949 --> 00:38:22.445
Composition,
Constitution,

00:38:22.445 --> 00:38:25.940
Configuration and Conformation.
 

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.518
But you've got to be patient.
 

00:38:27.518 --> 00:38:29.230
It'll take a little while to
get there;

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:32.469
it was several more decades.
 

00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:37.813
Okay, now these isomers of HCNO
have been calculated to death in

00:38:37.813 --> 00:38:42.476
2004, and we actually did a
problem set and showed these

00:38:42.476 --> 00:38:43.750
earlier on.
 

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:44.440
But here's what they are.
 

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.920
There's cyanic acid.
 

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.771
And notice, this is the same
anion, but you pull the proton

00:38:48.771 --> 00:38:50.639
off one end and put it on the
other.

00:38:50.639 --> 00:38:54.590
It's somewhat less stable,
but they interconvert easily.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.139
Okay?
 

00:38:55.139 --> 00:38:57.190
There's the one,
when you put nitrogen in the

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.610
middle.
 

00:38:57.610 --> 00:38:58.780
It's considerably higher.
 

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.840
That's called fulminic acid.
 

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.010
And if you put the hydrogen on
the other end of that one.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.309
Now the bottom one is what
Wöhler was working with,

00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:10.309
but the top one was being
studied by the other guy,

00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:12.030
Liebig;
fulminic acid.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:14.909
And the name comes from,
which means lightening.

00:39:14.909 --> 00:39:19.614
Because like so many young
lads, Liebig enjoyed things that

00:39:19.614 --> 00:39:20.750
would blow up.
 

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:21.480
Right?
 

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:25.614
And he blew the window out of
the pharmacy where he was

00:39:25.614 --> 00:39:27.530
serving as an apprentice.
 

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:28.219
Right?
 

00:39:28.219 --> 00:39:31.994
And then he went to Gay-Lussac,
to work on silver fulminate,

00:39:31.994 --> 00:39:35.769
which is not great stuff to
work on, as people who know from

00:39:35.769 --> 00:39:37.050
fulminates know.
 

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.760
But anyhow in 1824 he was in
Paris working on that.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.130
And Gay-Lussac noticed the
paper from Wöhler on the

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:46.623
analysis of silver cyanate,
and saw that they had the same

00:39:46.623 --> 00:39:47.420
analysis.
 

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:49.730
So he got them together,
Gay-Lussac did.

00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:52.809
Now notice -- and we're going
to talk much more about the

00:39:52.809 --> 00:39:56.518
interaction of those two guys --
but notice in this portrait of

00:39:56.518 --> 00:39:59.889
Liebig that there's a device
down in the bottom right.

00:39:59.889 --> 00:40:01.679
Remember, people,
when they got their portraits

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:04.170
made, always put something they
thought was significant there.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.699
So this is what he thought was
significant.

00:40:06.699 --> 00:40:09.570
And here it is.
 

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:10.570
It's not the actual one.
 

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:16.210
This is made by our glassblower.
 

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:20.449
And you've seen it before.
 

00:40:20.449 --> 00:40:23.782
For example,
you come by this when you're

00:40:23.782 --> 00:40:25.449
hurrying to class.
 

00:40:25.449 --> 00:40:29.601
And notice right there,
same thing.

00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:30.579
Right?
 

00:40:30.579 --> 00:40:34.213
Or, if any of you are student
members of the American Chemical

00:40:34.213 --> 00:40:36.000
Society, that's on the logo.
 

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.900
Because that was the most
important device of the 19th

00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:43.860
Century for organic chemistry.
 

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.793
It's called the five-bulb
apparatus, the Fünfkugel

00:40:47.793 --> 00:40:48.760
Apparat.
 

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:49.409
Okay?
 

00:40:49.409 --> 00:40:52.590
And it was used by Liebig for
analysis.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.420
So here's how Liebig did his
analysis.

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:58.250
And you can see the five-bulb
apparatus here.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.090
So he had a tube,
much like Berzelius's,

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:04.280
in which he put burning
charcoal in there,

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.579
and he'd heat it up and
generate the gases,

00:41:06.579 --> 00:41:10.210
but on a much smaller scale
than Berzelius did.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:13.974
Okay, it came through a drying
agent, that collected the water

00:41:13.974 --> 00:41:15.268
that was a product.
 

00:41:15.268 --> 00:41:20.213
And then it came in to the
Fünfkugel Apparat,

00:41:20.213 --> 00:41:22.949
which was the CO_2 collector.
 

00:41:22.949 --> 00:41:25.516
So in here was sodium
hydroxide.

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:26.179
Right?
 

00:41:26.179 --> 00:41:29.449
And the way it worked was it
was tilted a little bit.

00:41:29.449 --> 00:41:33.545
You notice that it's propped up
here, with some pieces of wood,

00:41:33.545 --> 00:41:35.659
so that the bottom isn't flat.
 

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.460
It's tilted like this.
 

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:38.239
Okay?
 

00:41:38.239 --> 00:41:48.340
So the gas comes in.
 

00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:50.795
And because it's tilted,
it bubbles from one to the

00:41:50.795 --> 00:41:51.139
next.
 

00:41:51.139 --> 00:41:51.849
Right?
 

00:41:51.849 --> 00:41:53.280
So it mixes well and absorbs.
 

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.369
So you don't -- remember,
Lavoisier needed a couple,

00:41:55.369 --> 00:41:58.279
a guy standing there to stir
those things so that the

00:41:58.279 --> 00:42:00.349
CO_2… This was
self-collecting,

00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.909
right?
 

00:42:00.909 --> 00:42:04.750
And then at the end you cool
the thing off.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:08.579
Now notice -- what do you
notice about the bulbs here?

00:42:08.579 --> 00:42:09.159
Student:  The size.
 

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.219
Prof: They're different
sized.

00:42:10.219 --> 00:42:15.489
And you had to put it this way,
not this way.

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:17.099
Why did you have to do it this
way?

00:42:23.039 --> 00:42:24.389
Because what happened at the
end?

00:42:24.389 --> 00:42:27.119
You stopped the fire,
and it would suck back.

00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:37.679
So this had to be big enough to
hold all the liquid.

00:42:37.679 --> 00:42:39.730
This one didn't.
 

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:40.659
So they were a different size.
 

00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:43.492
You don't want to make both of
them big, because you want to

00:42:43.492 --> 00:42:44.980
keep it as light as possible.
 

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.010
It was made out of very thin
glass.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:51.860
So there's only one that still
exists, that Liebig had.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.210
So it was tilted for the reason
we said.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:58.206
And here's the original one,
which is still in Giessen,

00:42:58.206 --> 00:43:01.239
in Germany, where he was a
professor then.

00:43:01.239 --> 00:43:01.980
Right?
 

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.679
But this was a great advance
because,

00:43:04.679 --> 00:43:09.958
with this, a single student
could do three analyses in a

00:43:09.958 --> 00:43:12.471
day,
rather than Lavoisier's big

00:43:12.471 --> 00:43:15.949
machine that required four
people working forever;

00:43:15.949 --> 00:43:18.068
or Berzelius's,
which required waiting

00:43:18.068 --> 00:43:21.047
overnight for the CO_2_
to be absorbed all,

00:43:21.047 --> 00:43:21.849
and so on.
 

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:23.710
So this was the most important
thing.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:25.523
And everybody,
all the students,

00:43:25.523 --> 00:43:28.684
who wanted to be organic
chemists, went to learn how to

00:43:28.684 --> 00:43:30.090
do this, in Giessen.
 

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:32.992
So Liebig is almost everyone's
great-great-grea

00:43:32.992 --> 00:43:36.210
t-great-great-wh
atever-grandfather in chemistry.

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.849
Because all the people who went
out to teach studied how to do

00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:41.460
this with him in Giessen.
 

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.034
So here's a portrait,
a little bit later portrait,

00:43:45.034 --> 00:43:49.340
of Liebig, after he had gone to
Munich to be a big wheel.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.806
And but again he chose in his
portrait to have a picture of

00:43:52.806 --> 00:43:54.960
the Fünfkugel
Apparat.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.143
But if you look at it
carefully, you see something

00:43:57.143 --> 00:43:57.989
very interesting.
 

00:43:57.989 --> 00:44:01.710
Do you see what it is?
 

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:03.143
As far as I know,
no one ever noticed this

00:44:03.143 --> 00:44:03.460
before.
 

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:12.590
It's hooked up backwards.
 

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.329
How can he possibly have hooked
it up backwards?

00:44:15.329 --> 00:44:17.559
He must've told hundreds of
students over the years,

00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:20.052
"Look, when you put it
together, you put it this way,

00:44:20.052 --> 00:44:21.059
not this way."
 

00:44:21.059 --> 00:44:24.201
It's like which tube in a
condenser you connect to the

00:44:24.201 --> 00:44:24.556
water.
 

00:44:24.556 --> 00:44:25.090
Right?
 

00:44:25.090 --> 00:44:25.780
&gt;
 

00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.253
It's exactly the same kind of
thing.

00:44:28.253 --> 00:44:28.820
Right?
 

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:33.260
So I just think that's amazing,
that he didn't notice that.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.420
But anyhow.
 

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:38.349
There we got it backwards.
 

00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:41.085
Okay, this was his teaching
laboratory, which still exists

00:44:41.085 --> 00:44:41.710
in Giessen.
 

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:42.429
It's a museum.
 

00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:43.780
It's interesting to go there.
 

00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.496
And there's,
on the wall,

00:44:45.496 --> 00:44:48.271
there's this thing,
and it shows all of his

00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:51.512
students and grand-students and
great-grand-students who became

00:44:51.512 --> 00:44:54.989
distinguished professors,
and the ones in red are ones

00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:58.280
who got the Nobel Prize;
the ones with red on them.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.219
And you could extend it now.
 

00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:02.672
This stops in the middle of the
20th Century,

00:45:02.672 --> 00:45:05.346
and practically everyone's
descended from Liebig,

00:45:05.346 --> 00:45:06.349
including you.
 

00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:07.969
Okay?
 

00:45:07.969 --> 00:45:09.630
This is his lab.
 

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.456
And here, this is,
here's Ortigosa,

00:45:12.456 --> 00:45:15.784
from Mexico,
and he was supposed to be so

00:45:15.784 --> 00:45:20.690
good at analysis that he could
do it better than Liebig did.

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:21.690
Right?
 

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:25.340
So he's the one that got to
hold the five-bulb apparatus.

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.280
And what do you notice about it?
 

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.295
He's holding it upside down;
the potassium hydroxide would

00:45:32.295 --> 00:45:33.027
run out.
 

00:45:33.027 --> 00:45:33.760
Right?
 

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.487
And this guy is A.W. Hofmann,
who -- there's this thing of

00:45:37.487 --> 00:45:41.280
him: "A master and shining
teacher of chemistry,

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.018
a triumphant discoverer of
aniline and aniline dyes."

00:45:45.018 --> 00:45:48.983
And he also was the guy that
was really good at languages,

00:45:48.983 --> 00:45:52.389
and devised a lot of the names
we use nowadays.

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:56.369
So we'll talk about that later.
 

00:45:56.369 --> 00:45:59.478
And here in the background,
looking through a window into

00:45:59.478 --> 00:46:01.327
the lab,
is it looks to be -- I'm not

00:46:01.327 --> 00:46:04.150
sure that that's what it is --
but it looks like a bust.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.179
Does it look like a bust to you?
 

00:46:06.179 --> 00:46:09.612
And if it's a bust,
it's probably this bust,

00:46:09.612 --> 00:46:10.570
of Liebig.
 

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:11.880
So there.
 

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.869
&gt;
 

00:46:12.869 --> 00:46:14.570
It's fun to go there.
 

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:18.260
Okay, so in 1832,
Liebig and Wöhler

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.518
collaborated to develop the
radical theory.

00:46:22.518 --> 00:46:24.740
And we'll just give an
introduction to that and not go

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:25.789
all the way through it.
 

00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:28.304
So Liebig and Wöhler
remember had been introduced by

00:46:28.304 --> 00:46:28.889
Gay-Lussac.
 

00:46:28.889 --> 00:46:32.052
So they were of the same age
and doing similar kinds of

00:46:32.052 --> 00:46:32.579
things.
 

00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:38.090
So they first met in Frankfurt
in 1825.

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:40.206
And five years later,
when they were writing,

00:46:40.206 --> 00:46:43.255
they first used the familiar;
you know, like the tu in

00:46:43.255 --> 00:46:46.318
French or du in Germany,
if you're really great friends

00:46:46.318 --> 00:46:48.376
with someone,
or within the family you use

00:46:48.376 --> 00:46:48.880
that.
 

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.500
So they became great pals.
 

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.585
And in 1832,
Wöhler said:

00:46:52.585 --> 00:46:56.039
"I long to do some more
significant work.

00:46:56.039 --> 00:47:00.574
Shouldn't we try to shed some
light on the confusion about the

00:47:00.574 --> 00:47:02.360
oil of bitter almonds?
 

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.409
But where to get
material?"

00:47:04.409 --> 00:47:04.940
Right?
 

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:08.469
So Baker, J.T. Baker didn't
exist then.

00:47:08.469 --> 00:47:11.925
But if they were now,
they could just order up a

00:47:11.925 --> 00:47:13.030
bottle of it.
 

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.489
So can you smell this?
 

00:47:15.489 --> 00:47:17.980
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:19.949
Prof: Do you recognize
the odor?

00:47:19.949 --> 00:47:21.929
Pass it around carefully,
don't drop it.

00:47:21.929 --> 00:47:24.190
&gt;
 

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:27.070
It's not that bad,
but you don't want to drop it.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:31.320
See if you recognize the odor.
 

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.420
Like almonds,
the oil of bitter almonds.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:36.518
Okay?
 

00:47:36.518 --> 00:47:39.688
Okay, so in June of 1832,
just the next month,

00:47:39.688 --> 00:47:43.070
Liebig wrote to his pal
Wöhler and said,

00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:45.476
"My poor deal Wöhler,
how empty is every comfort

00:47:45.476 --> 00:47:46.659
against such a loss."
 

00:47:46.659 --> 00:47:49.409
(Because Wöhler's young
wife had just died.)

00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:51.711
"When I think how content
and happy you were during your

00:47:51.711 --> 00:47:53.264
move,
what attachment and love you

00:47:53.264 --> 00:47:55.219
had for one another…
The good wife,

00:47:55.219 --> 00:47:58.018
so young and full of life,
so irreplaceable for her

00:47:58.018 --> 00:47:59.250
parents and for you.
 

00:47:59.250 --> 00:48:00.518
Come to us, dear Wöhler.
 

00:48:00.518 --> 00:48:02.739
Although we may not be able to
give you comfort,

00:48:02.739 --> 00:48:05.289
we will perhaps be able to help
you bear your grief.

00:48:05.289 --> 00:48:08.197
Staying in Cassel at this time
would only be detrimental to

00:48:08.197 --> 00:48:08.900
your health.
 

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.940
We need to be busy with
something.

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.052
I have just been able to get
some amygdalin from Paris,

00:48:14.052 --> 00:48:16.820
and I am ordering 25 pounds of
bitter almonds.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.440
You must not travel,
you must busy yourself,

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.659
but not in Cassel.
 

00:48:20.659 --> 00:48:22.820
I haven't had the courage to
tell my wife yet."

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:23.699
&gt;
 

00:48:23.699 --> 00:48:25.242
"Come to us,
I expect you at the end of this

00:48:25.242 --> 00:48:25.659
week."
 

00:48:25.659 --> 00:48:27.791
No, what he didn't want to tell
her about was the death of

00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:28.989
Wöhler's wife,
obviously.

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:30.210
Okay.
 

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:32.349
So then in July Wöhler
says it came:

00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:35.505
"The oil of bitter almonds
has come with the books from

00:48:35.505 --> 00:48:36.039
Paris.
 

00:48:36.039 --> 00:48:38.320
I've kept half of it and am
herewith sending you the rest.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.061
I've already started all kinds
of experiments with it,

00:48:41.061 --> 00:48:43.699
without being able to obtain
any precise results.

00:48:43.699 --> 00:48:45.750
It seems to be a hard nut."
 

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:49.650
This is an example of
Wöhler's lame sense of

00:48:49.650 --> 00:48:50.300
humor.
 

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.289
He did this all the time.
 

00:48:52.289 --> 00:48:54.306
"I'm coming soon to you
and will be able to

00:48:54.306 --> 00:48:54.949
report."
 

00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:59.012
So they worked together for two
weeks on this and developed the

00:48:59.012 --> 00:49:01.831
most important theory,
on the basis of these

00:49:01.831 --> 00:49:02.880
experiments.
 

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:03.619
Wöhler returned.
 

00:49:03.619 --> 00:49:05.920
He said: "Here I am again
in my gloomy lonesomeness,

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:08.661
not knowing how to thank you
for all the love with which you

00:49:08.661 --> 00:49:10.380
took me in and kept me for so
long.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.030
How happy I was to work with
you from moment to moment.

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:17.018
Herewith I'm sending the paper
on oil of bitter almonds."

00:49:17.018 --> 00:49:20.105
So next time we'll talk about
what they did with their oil of

00:49:20.105 --> 00:49:20.980
bitter almonds.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:01.734
Prof: All right.
 

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:02.160
Let us begin,
please.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.810
We're going to get started to
stay on track for this morning.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.168
Don't forget,
of course, that we have this

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:12.390
exciting event next Tuesday,
which is our second test.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.290
There will be--I know.
 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.220
Curb your enthusiasm.
 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.127
There will be a review section
for that, indeed three of them,

00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:24.690
next Monday night as we did
last time.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.470
They'll be in room 207 of WLH
again this Monday:

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.205
seven, eight and nine
respectively,

00:00:31.205 --> 00:00:33.940
and yours truly will be there.
 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.790
We'll also have Monday
afternoon.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.416
If you want individual help,
you can come to my office and

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:42.088
one of the TAs will be covering
a run of about four or five

00:00:42.088 --> 00:00:44.668
hours there Monday afternoon
probably starting around one

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:47.170
o'clock,
and of course I'll be sending

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.166
you a prep sheet on this so that
you will know how to prepare for

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:54.350
this test just as we prepared
for the last test.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.695
The test itself will be very
similar to the first test except

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:01.475
we--
when we get to the listening

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.926
pieces,
then we will not be so much

00:01:03.926 --> 00:01:07.510
concentrating on individual
isolated aspects of melody,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.349
rhythm and harmony but these
broader questions of form.

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:11.340
What is the form?
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.099
Where are we in the form?
 

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:16.750
That's the essence of the
assignment there.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.239
We're working here with form
and it's very important.

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:24.396
It brings, I think--my guess is
in all of the listening that

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:26.581
you've been doing,
pop music, classical,

00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:28.677
whatever it is,
how many when you were

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:30.650
listening ever thought about
form?

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.290
Did you ever think about it,
any of you?

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.730
Okay.
 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.101
One person I see raised their
hand, and maybe Roger raises his

00:01:39.101 --> 00:01:42.360
hand but not too
enthusiastically.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.041
Yeah, it's the kind of thing
that you could do a lot of

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:46.680
playing and listening to music.
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.640
You could take as my
seventeen-year-old,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.790
maybe seventeen-year-old,
maybe twelve,

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.800
thirteen years of cello and I
could ask him,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.989
"What form do we have?
 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:57.000
Where are we in the form?"
 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.447
and he wouldn't really know
because he hasn't been exposed

00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:00.480
to that sort of thing.
 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.078
Well, it does help us.
 

00:02:02.078 --> 00:02:05.125
It's a whole dimension of
listening that we can plug into,

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.063
whether it's pop music and
you're dealing with verse and

00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:09.240
chorus and bridge.
 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.264
or even as we'll see today,
ostinato--in pop music

00:02:13.264 --> 00:02:16.500
or in classical music you plug
in the form.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.501
Now what are the six forms that
we are going to be plugging in

00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:23.188
here?
 

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:23.441
Hm?
 

00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:26.710
Somebody run us through our
checklist.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.919
Roger, get us started, please.
 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.871
Student: --say one or--
Prof: Yeah,

00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.360
you can say one and then you
might pass the baton.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.680
&gt;
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.818
Student: Sonata-allegro.
 

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:35.498
Prof: Okay.
 

00:02:35.498 --> 00:02:36.782
Sonata-allegro,
the most difficult,

00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:37.500
the biggest one.
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.669
We spent the most time with
that.

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:40.090
What else?
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.240
Chris.
 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.758
Student: Fugue.
 

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:42.355
Prof: Fugue.
 

00:02:42.355 --> 00:02:43.990
We spent a lot of time with
that, fairly difficult.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.800
Daniel.
 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.330
Student: Rondo.
 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.555
Prof: Rondo,
a little bit easier in the

00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:50.740
sense that you've got this one
theme that kind of bludgeons you

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.256
to--
if you get a theme and then you

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.191
get something else,
and that theme comes back and

00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:55.780
then probably something else yet
again.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.166
Then that theme comes back and
then something else again and

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.181
again,
and then theme and so on,

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:04.281
so you get the object and then
a lot of contrast but the object

00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:05.669
keeps coming back.
 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:06.610
What else?
 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.979
Have we mentioned--Chelsea.
 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:10.449
Student: Ternary.
 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:11.610
Prof: I'm sorry.
 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.050
Student: Ternary form.
 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.370
Prof: Ternary form. Yeah.
 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.435
That may be the easiest,
kind of just the A,

00:03:17.435 --> 00:03:18.569
B, A idea.
 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.330
And we're missing one, I think.
 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.598
Yeah.
 

00:03:21.598 --> 00:03:21.949
Student:
&gt;

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:22.919
Prof: Theme and
variations.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.159
Your name, please.
 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.680
Student: Kristin.
 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.629
Prof: I'm sorry?
 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.000
Student: Kristin.
 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.220
Prof: Kristin. Okay.
 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.438
Thanks very much, Kristin.
 

00:03:28.438 --> 00:03:32.840
So theme and variations is the
last one.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.108
When you go to a concert,
sometimes you can pick up the

00:03:35.108 --> 00:03:37.483
program,
and here is a cover of a

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:41.870
program that's going to serve as
the make-up for our--

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.128
the make-up concert for our
class.

00:03:45.128 --> 00:03:50.750
It's next Saturday--yes,
yeah, a week from Saturday.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.331
The Jonathan Edwards Orchestra
is going to be performing at

00:03:54.331 --> 00:03:58.098
Battell and they'll be doing the
Beethoven Eighth Symphony and

00:03:58.098 --> 00:04:01.742
when you go there you're going
to have four movements in the

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:03.718
Beethoven Eighth Symphony.
 

00:04:03.718 --> 00:04:06.074
What's a good guess as to what
form the first movement's going

00:04:06.074 --> 00:04:06.500
to be in?
 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.919
Student:
&gt;

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.101
Prof: Sonata-allegro.
 

00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:09.312
Okay.
 

00:04:09.312 --> 00:04:10.030
Sonata-allegro.
 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.478
The second movement-- Well,
it could be in a number of

00:04:12.478 --> 00:04:13.310
different forms.
 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.226
What's a good guess for what
the form of the third movement

00:04:16.226 --> 00:04:16.730
will be?
 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.230
Ternary form.
 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.964
It's going to be some kind of
minuet or perhaps scherzo--I

00:04:22.964 --> 00:04:25.651
think in this case scherzo,
trio, scherzo,

00:04:25.651 --> 00:04:26.569
that idea.
 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.964
Ternary form usually is the
third movement of these

00:04:28.964 --> 00:04:31.084
four-movement symphony--
and then the last

00:04:31.084 --> 00:04:33.350
movement--well,
we'll have to sort of come to

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.769
terms with that--
figure that one out on the fly,

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:41.089
and that's what we'll be doing
in our test on Tuesday,

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:44.230
although it will be a slow,
sort of lento fly there.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:48.040
We'll be going through it much
more slowly than just one pass.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.555
So sometimes when listening
you've got to hear the music and

00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:54.771
make some kind of educated
determination as to what the

00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:58.641
form is and then you kind,
as I say, drop this template of

00:04:58.641 --> 00:05:02.360
that particular form down in
your mind and then filter the

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.970
music thereafter through that
model,

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.379
be it the model of
sonata-allegro or the model of

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.509
fugue or the model of rondo.
 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.360
You kind of hear the piece in
that form thereafter.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.920
Questions about that?
 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.800
All right.
 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.935
If not, let's proceed with one
final form today,

00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:26.399
which is ostinato.
 

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:27.889
That's our sixth form.
 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.160
We haven't been introduced to
that.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.314
We're going to do
ostinato,

00:05:30.314 --> 00:05:32.803
but before we get to that,
I want to recap one thing

00:05:32.803 --> 00:05:36.281
having to do with theme and
variation form because it allows

00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:40.290
us to bring in some other things
that we have been talking about.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.346
So it's a good culminating
listening experience,

00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:46.533
and that is the finale of
Beethoven's "Eroica

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:47.769
Symphony."
 

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:50.240
Anybody know what--why it's
called the "Eroica

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.079
Symphony"?
 

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:54.610
Who is the hero that's
referenced there?

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:55.569
Caroline.
 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:55.910
Student: Napoleon.
 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.310
Prof: Napoleon, right.
 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.269
So Beethoven was working on
this symphony.

00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:00.720
Napoleon was the hero.
 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.100
Then he gets word from Paris
that Napoleon has had himself

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.170
crowned emperor.
 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.557
He thinks: "Oh, my God,
Napoleon's just a tyrant like

00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:10.259
all the rest of them,"
so he's furious and he

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:13.261
scratches out on his score--
and I--when you get to the

00:06:13.261 --> 00:06:15.100
Beethoven chapter of your
textbook,

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.718
look there.
 

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:18.646
There's a photograph of the
cover of the "Eroica

00:06:18.646 --> 00:06:21.012
Symphony"
and you can see the big hole

00:06:21.012 --> 00:06:24.730
where Beethoven with his knife
scratched out Napoleon's name.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.004
And then later on he goes on to
simply identify that as

00:06:28.004 --> 00:06:30.916
"Symphony for a Hero,"
the "Eroica

00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:32.069
Symphony."
 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.026
So that's what we mean by that
particular--the hero originally

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:37.389
was to be Napoleon.
 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.867
So when we finish this
exercise, when you finish this

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:42.583
course, you will have actually
been exposed to a number of

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:43.870
Beethoven's symphonies.
 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.759
We're talking about No. 3 here.
 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:46.550
We opened with No. 5.
 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.319
On the concert a week from
Saturday,

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.261
you'll have Beethoven 8 and
those of you that went to the

00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:55.464
preceding concert are not barred
from attending the one on the

00:06:55.464 --> 00:06:56.620
first of November.
 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.848
You too can get in the door
there, so you might want to go

00:06:58.848 --> 00:07:00.725
to that--
7:30 in Battell Chapel

00:07:00.725 --> 00:07:03.795
November^( )1st,
and the concert the other night

00:07:03.795 --> 00:07:07.504
we had Beethoven's Sixth so you
will have been exposed to four

00:07:07.504 --> 00:07:10.790
Beethoven symphonies here in
this course and that--

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.161
that's pretty good for a
beginning course,

00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:12.430
great.
 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.043
All right.
 

00:07:13.043 --> 00:07:16.857
So let's talk about the finale
here and it's based on--and it's

00:07:16.857 --> 00:07:17.778
kind of fun.
 

00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:20.307
It's actually more complex than
we would ever do on a test but

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:21.550
it's fun to work through it.
 

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.283
It's based on two themes,
so this is a set of variations

00:07:26.283 --> 00:07:27.920
using two themes.
 

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.319
Beethoven liked to do this.
 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.439
He did this--actually,
he did this in a slow movement

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:34.420
of &gt;.
 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.899
What's that?
 

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:37.129
What symphony is that?
 

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:38.209
Anybody remember?
 

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:38.516
Yeah.
 

00:07:38.516 --> 00:07:42.326
It was the Beethoven Sixth that
we had at the concert the other

00:07:42.326 --> 00:07:45.583
night with the woodwinds and all
&gt;

00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:47.550
&gt;
 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:48.819
and so on.
 

00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:54.279
&gt;
 

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.379
That was the second theme.
 

00:07:55.379 --> 00:08:00.422
That was kind of the second,
the B idea if you will,

00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:02.399
of the two themes.
 

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:05.250
So there in the slow movement
of Beethoven's "Sixth

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.528
Symphony"
we had a double variation,

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:10.399
and what we mean by double
variation is simply that there

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:11.680
are two themes in play.
 

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.379
So here we have the two themes.
 

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:17.290
One, the way he's constructed
here, is in the treble.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:27.230
&gt;
 

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.290
That's theme number one.
 

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.310
Here is theme number two.
 

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:47.159
&gt;
 

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:49.389
So those are the two themes.
 

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:50.470
So let's listen to some of this.
 

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.381
It's going to start out with
just a little bit of a curtain

00:08:53.381 --> 00:08:55.994
raiser so I have a curtain
raiser and then one of the

00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.200
themes will come in.
 

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.740
Which one does Beethoven start
with?

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.269
&gt;
 

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:02.970
Okay. Up goes the curtain.
 

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:19.549
&gt;
 

00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:19.840
Repeat.
 

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:26.220
&gt;
 

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.850
Continue.
 

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:36.480
&gt;
 

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:44.288
Repeat.
 

00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:44.571
Okay.
 

00:09:44.571 --> 00:09:46.259
We're going to stop it there.
 

00:09:46.259 --> 00:09:48.789
So which theme did he choose to
work with here at the outset?

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:51.440
Anybody know? Daniel?
 

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.899
Student: The bass theme.
 

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:54.013
Prof: Yeah,
the bass theme,

00:09:54.013 --> 00:09:54.789
&gt;
 

00:09:54.789 --> 00:09:56.120
and how is it being played?
 

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.110
Wasn't it a pizzicato?
 

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.779
&gt;
 

00:09:58.779 --> 00:10:00.720
So that's the bass theme.
 

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.163
All right.
 

00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:03.649
So that's in a sense--we'll
say--call it variation one.

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:05.678
Let's go on to variation two
here.

00:10:05.678 --> 00:10:07.750
Which theme does he choose to
use at this point?

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:15.009
&gt;
 

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:16.799
Repeat.
 

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:32.250
&gt;
 

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.639
And repeat.
 

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:41.629
&gt;
 

00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:42.041
Okay.
 

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.840
So which theme is he using
there?

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.320
One or two?
 

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:46.657
Yeah.
 

00:10:46.657 --> 00:10:50.505
Evgeny says two and it was
still the bass theme and it was

00:10:50.505 --> 00:10:54.355
a little bit harder to hear this
time because it was being

00:10:54.355 --> 00:10:57.259
covered up above by some
counterpoint.

00:10:57.259 --> 00:10:58.139
So we've got the theme.
 

00:10:58.139 --> 00:11:00.460
We've got counterpoint against
it.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.224
Let's go on into variation
number three and we'll see what

00:11:03.224 --> 00:11:03.710
happens.
 

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:05.279
&gt;
 

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.980
Which one here?
 

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:11.298
&gt;
 

00:11:11.298 --> 00:11:25.500
Repeat, going on,
&gt;

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.120
and repeat.
 

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:37.100
&gt;
 

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.471
So which theme this time?
 

00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:39.129
One or two?
 

00:11:39.129 --> 00:11:39.879
Student: Two.
 

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.741
Prof: Still two,
but he's moved it up into the

00:11:41.741 --> 00:11:43.937
first violins,
moved it up higher and he's got

00:11:43.937 --> 00:11:46.730
more sort of fast-running
counterpoint against it.

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.779
Let's go on to the next.
 

00:11:47.779 --> 00:11:49.950
We've got to get number one at
some point.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.019
&gt;
 

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:54.649
Hooray.
 

00:11:54.649 --> 00:12:25.250
&gt;
 

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:26.080
All right.
 

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.158
 
 

00:12:32.158 --> 00:12:35.200
What was the solo instrument
there, and how did he

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.379
orchestrate this?
 

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:38.402
Well, the first statement of
this first theme,

00:12:38.402 --> 00:12:40.110
he assigned it to a solo
instrument.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:43.490
Then in the repeat he had the
strings take it over.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.278
Then that solo instrument came
back and then on the repeat the

00:12:47.278 --> 00:12:49.080
strings took it over again.
 

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.879
So it's an interesting use of
orchestration here.

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:54.827
Let's listen to this variation
again and what is the solo

00:12:54.827 --> 00:12:56.039
instrument up on top?
 

00:12:56.039 --> 00:13:17.048
&gt;
 

00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:17.292
Okay.
 

00:13:17.292 --> 00:13:19.230
Let's pause it there just for a
second.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.440
So what's the solo instrument?
 

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.200
Student: Oboe.
 

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.340
Prof: Oboe, yeah.
 

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.419
So there's an oboe penetrating
up on high.

00:13:24.419 --> 00:13:25.820
Question up there, Roger?
 

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:31.816
Student: Can we think of
this kind of like the

00:13:31.816 --> 00:13:34.928
&gt;
 

00:13:34.928 --> 00:13:36.115
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:39.080
I wouldn't want to take that
too far though.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.232
This is sort of an isolated
event here where you do have a

00:13:42.232 --> 00:13:43.450
call and a response.
 

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.777
And it does happen just in this
one variation but it's going to

00:13:46.777 --> 00:13:48.710
be limited to this one
variation,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.731
whereas in a Bessie Smith blues
tune you would have that call

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:56.017
and response idea carried on
throughout the entire

00:13:56.017 --> 00:13:57.090
composition.
 

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.350
It's a good point though.
 

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.158
I hadn't thought of it in those
terms, but that's it exactly.

00:14:01.158 --> 00:14:05.245
You got a call by the oboe and
then a repeat of that idea maybe

00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.090
elaborated by the strings.
 

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:09.445
So here we are up here,
the solo oboe,

00:14:09.445 --> 00:14:13.326
and then we are going to have
the response now by the strings,

00:14:13.326 --> 00:14:15.110
so let's listen to that.
 

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.000
&gt;
 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.009
Here we go, strings.
 

00:14:20.009 --> 00:14:28.100
&gt;
 

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:28.288
Okay.
 

00:14:28.288 --> 00:14:30.110
We're going to pause it here
just for a second.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.009
Now something interesting
happens.

00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:35.261
When we were dealing with
sonata-allegro form we said that

00:14:35.261 --> 00:14:38.572
there were four functional types
and this really isn't just

00:14:38.572 --> 00:14:40.570
limited to sonata-allegro form.
 

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.908
There are functional types in
all kinds of music.

00:14:42.908 --> 00:14:45.890
When you go to a movie,
a cinema, a film for example,

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.815
oftentimes at the end of the
scene, they will have a

00:14:48.815 --> 00:14:51.509
fade-out, and listen to the
fade-out music.

00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:54.226
There's kind of transition
music in film music a lot of

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:54.629
times.
 

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:57.538
Then maybe we get a new scene
and it's very prominently

00:14:57.538 --> 00:15:00.018
displayed--well,
maybe we get thematic music at

00:15:00.018 --> 00:15:01.418
that particular point.
 

00:15:01.418 --> 00:15:04.490
So this idea of theme and
transition,

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.552
even development,
can occur in all different

00:15:06.552 --> 00:15:09.048
kinds of music in all different
kinds of context,

00:15:09.048 --> 00:15:12.519
but just to review that idea:
we have thematic music,

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:16.950
we have transitional music,
we have developmental music,

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.620
and again it doesn't have to be
limited to sonata-allegro form.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.833
We saw developmental music in a
section of a--of the fugue

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:26.870
called what?
 

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.926
Does anybody remember what we
called that section of the fugue

00:15:29.926 --> 00:15:31.330
that was so developmental?
 

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:32.110
Thaddeus.
 

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.590
Student: The episode.
 

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:35.791
Prof: The episode,
so there we--in the episode of

00:15:35.791 --> 00:15:40.470
the fugue we have developmental
activity and we get ending,

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:42.802
cadential, stuff virtually in
every kind of music so it's not

00:15:42.802 --> 00:15:44.279
limited just to sonata-allegro
form.

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:49.267
But the question here is what
is Beethoven writing at this

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:50.928
particular point?
 

00:15:50.928 --> 00:15:54.388
Here we are in theme and
variations but I think we're

00:15:54.388 --> 00:15:58.046
referencing one of the four
functional types of music in

00:15:58.046 --> 00:15:59.509
this next section.
 

00:15:59.509 --> 00:16:02.070
So what functional type is it?
 

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:10.149
&gt;
 

00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:10.417
Okay.
 

00:16:10.417 --> 00:16:12.399
So what was that that we just
heard?

00:16:12.399 --> 00:16:13.409
What would you guess?
 

00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:15.808
Daniel.
 

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.264
A transition.
 

00:16:17.264 --> 00:16:23.975
Yeah, he's just taking us very
simply from point A to point B

00:16:23.975 --> 00:16:26.658
&gt;
 

00:16:26.658 --> 00:16:28.700
and maybe just a little bit
idea of a cadence.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.087
Transitions usually end with a
couple of final-sounding chords

00:16:32.087 --> 00:16:34.885
there at the end,
so that's a transition and

00:16:34.885 --> 00:16:39.037
we've moved and we've moved from
here &gt;

00:16:39.037 --> 00:16:40.139
, a major key.
 

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:41.940
What would you imagine we're
going to move to?

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.149
A minor key and it's probably,
again,

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:48.408
although we don't hear it--I
don't hear it--

00:16:48.408 --> 00:16:50.746
we don't hear it,
it's probably going to be the

00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:53.948
relative minor because it's just
simpler structurally to operate

00:16:53.948 --> 00:16:54.610
that way.
 

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.437
So let's listen now to the next
variation here,

00:16:57.437 --> 00:16:59.960
but something very interesting
happens.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.528
He's referencing another form.
 

00:17:02.528 --> 00:17:06.503
He's incorporating another form
in the composition as a

00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:09.670
variation, so what is the other
form now?

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:36.319
&gt;
 

00:17:36.319 --> 00:17:38.779
Okay. Let's stop it right there.
 

00:17:38.779 --> 00:17:40.599
So what form is he referencing?
 

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:43.880
Michael?
 

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.210
Student: Yes.
 

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.748
Prof: Got it right
today.

00:17:44.748 --> 00:17:44.869
Okay.
 

00:17:44.869 --> 00:17:45.828
Student: A fugue.
 

00:17:45.828 --> 00:17:48.865
Prof: A fugue,
yeah, and we--in just one

00:17:48.865 --> 00:17:51.327
hearing is--
was a little--it'd be hard to

00:17:51.327 --> 00:17:54.458
really know what voices would
bring it in but I'll just tell

00:17:54.458 --> 00:17:54.828
you.
 

00:17:54.828 --> 00:18:01.284
Generally what he was doing
there was starting up on the top

00:18:01.284 --> 00:18:04.238
&gt;
 

00:18:04.238 --> 00:18:09.380
, okay, and then &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:14.019
and gradually coming down in
terms of range.

00:18:14.019 --> 00:18:16.538
So it was soprano,
alto, tenor and then bass.

00:18:16.538 --> 00:18:19.430
And the bass did something
interesting which sort of

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:21.808
reinforces a point we had the
other day.

00:18:21.808 --> 00:18:23.218
The fugue subject that he's
working with,

00:18:23.218 --> 00:18:24.240
&gt;
 

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.528
which by the way--
&gt;

00:18:27.528 --> 00:18:33.221
So he's kind of varying that
melody number one,

00:18:33.221 --> 00:18:36.808
&gt;
 

00:18:36.808 --> 00:18:40.154
kind of varying that melody,
but when it gets to the bass it

00:18:40.154 --> 00:18:41.799
does something interesting.
 

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:46.329
&gt;
 

00:18:46.329 --> 00:18:48.480
Why is that interesting?
 

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:54.250
&gt;
 

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:58.817
What process do we have at work
there that we talked about last

00:18:58.817 --> 00:19:00.880
time with regard to fugue?
 

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:01.990
Does anybody remember that?
 

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.380
Daniel?
 

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:04.029
Student: Inversion.
 

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:06.460
Prof: Inversion,
and I don't think I made that

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.308
point clearly enough the other
day,

00:19:08.308 --> 00:19:13.440
but any time you have
&gt;

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.940
or you could have &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.690
it's going up a minor third and
then down a second.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.690
You could go down a minor third
and then up a second.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:25.194
So you're just turning the
intervals and then kind of a

00:19:25.194 --> 00:19:26.170
mirror image there.
 

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:30.528
So here Beethoven uses a little
bit of inversion.

00:19:30.528 --> 00:19:35.023
So in the middle of this theme
and variation movement he

00:19:35.023 --> 00:19:38.538
inserts a fugue,
and a fugue inserted inside

00:19:38.538 --> 00:19:41.480
another form is called a fugato.
 

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.035
So here as the fourth,
I think fifth variation of this

00:19:46.035 --> 00:19:49.130
last movement he inserts a
fugato.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:54.240
 
 

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.931
We're going to listen to one
final variation here and we--at

00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:01.121
this point we want to
concentrate on the duration of

00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:02.058
the melody.
 

00:20:02.058 --> 00:20:07.576
We were starting out
&gt;

00:20:07.576 --> 00:20:12.960
, one, two, one,
two, in that fashion.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.109
What's Beethoven doing here?
 

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:21.140
 
 

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:25.160
&gt;
 

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.630
Here we go.
 

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:44.250
 
 

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.710
Let's pause it there just for a
second.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.994
So what's he done here to his
melody, to the duration within

00:20:49.994 --> 00:20:50.720
his melody?
 

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.150
Hm?
 

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:55.460
It's now--can you express it?
 

00:20:55.460 --> 00:21:01.088
If we were coming--
&gt;

00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:06.143
and now we're going
&gt;

00:21:06.143 --> 00:21:08.670
, what's he doing?
 

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.150
Student:
&gt;

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:11.337
Prof: Well,
come on.

00:21:11.337 --> 00:21:13.348
I just hear small,
little words out there.

00:21:13.348 --> 00:21:15.828
I--somebody--let's choose
somebody who's pretty confident

00:21:15.828 --> 00:21:17.380
and that person will yell it
out.

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:18.200
Marcos?
 

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.009
Student:
&gt;

00:21:19.009 --> 00:21:19.789
Prof: I'm sorry.
 

00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:20.470
I didn't hear that.
 

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:22.308
Student:
&gt;

00:21:22.308 --> 00:21:25.076
Prof: That's the
psychological effect of

00:21:25.076 --> 00:21:26.903
ritardando,
slowing it down,

00:21:26.903 --> 00:21:28.558
giving you a sense you're
getting to the end,

00:21:28.558 --> 00:21:30.053
but once again,
technically,

00:21:30.053 --> 00:21:32.098
that's not exactly what he's
doing.

00:21:32.098 --> 00:21:34.289
He's giving that effect by
doing something.

00:21:34.289 --> 00:21:34.970
Thaddeus.
 

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.038
Student:
&gt;

00:21:36.038 --> 00:21:37.525
Prof: Right.
 

00:21:37.525 --> 00:21:39.950
He's changing the note values.
 

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.734
He's simply doubling the note
values, and when we do that in

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:44.338
music we call that augmentation.
 

00:21:44.338 --> 00:21:48.108
Sometime, when we get to Hector
Berlioz, we'll see diminution.

00:21:48.108 --> 00:21:51.134
To give a sense of urgency to
the music, you can chop them all

00:21:51.134 --> 00:21:51.630
in half.
 

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.108
Well, here he's getting toward
the end.

00:21:53.108 --> 00:21:54.740
He wants this grand,
broad effect.

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.288
He's brought in the brasses.
 

00:21:56.288 --> 00:21:59.150
It's show time so what does he
do?

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.374
He doubles all of the note
values in theme number one so

00:22:02.374 --> 00:22:03.839
let's continue,
please.

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:36.140
&gt;
 

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.852
Okay, and then he sort of fades
out and adds a little coda at

00:22:38.852 --> 00:22:39.440
that point.
 

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.336
But that's the way we end the
Third Symphony,

00:22:42.336 --> 00:22:45.430
the "Eroica Symphony"
of Beethoven.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.272
So it's an interesting piece
because he's got a fugato in

00:22:47.272 --> 00:22:49.137
there,
he's got sections that sound

00:22:49.137 --> 00:22:51.660
like transition out of
sonata-allegro form,

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:54.098
and he's working with two
themes.

00:22:54.098 --> 00:22:57.200
Questions about that before we
move on?

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.747
All right.
 

00:22:57.747 --> 00:23:00.704
So let's put that behind us now
and go on to talk about

00:23:00.704 --> 00:23:02.019
ostinato form.
 

00:23:02.019 --> 00:23:06.181
Once again--we've been through
this many times--but what is an

00:23:06.181 --> 00:23:07.410
ostinato?
 

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.200
Okay. I know it's embarrassing.
 

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.220
It's something that happens
again and again and again,

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.787
just sort of
obsessive-compulsive disorder

00:23:16.787 --> 00:23:19.874
applied to music,
okay, obsessive-compulsive

00:23:19.874 --> 00:23:21.778
disorder applied to music.
 

00:23:21.778 --> 00:23:30.132
The most famous example of this
is probably the &lt;&lt;plays

00:23:30.132 --> 00:23:32.220
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:35.700
the Bolero of Maurice
Ravel,

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.772
so we've put that up on the
board here as our first

00:23:38.772 --> 00:23:42.232
ostinato piece,
1928, a piece in the twentieth

00:23:42.232 --> 00:23:42.808
century.
 

00:23:42.808 --> 00:23:47.537
It's ostinato in every
way in the sense that the melody

00:23:47.537 --> 00:23:52.108
keeps repeating over and over
again for fourteen minutes.

00:23:52.108 --> 00:23:55.892
The rhythm &lt;&lt;plays
drum&gt;&gt; ,

00:23:55.892 --> 00:24:00.670
that keeps going for fourteen
minutes and change,

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:05.048
depending on the tempo of the
conductor.

00:24:05.048 --> 00:24:10.517
And when we did this,
remember, you guys were

00:24:10.517 --> 00:24:16.730
providing the bass harmony
&gt;

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.060
and that's all you do for
fourteen minutes and thirty

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:19.509
seconds.
 

00:24:19.509 --> 00:24:21.731
So every aspect of
that--melody,

00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:24.598
rhythm and harmony--is
controlled by this

00:24:24.598 --> 00:24:26.750
ostinato procedure.
 

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.439
And then this example,
as mentioned,

00:24:28.439 --> 00:24:29.838
from the twentieth century.
 

00:24:29.838 --> 00:24:32.913
But the heyday of
ostinato form,

00:24:32.913 --> 00:24:36.311
well, really,
in two periods in the history

00:24:36.311 --> 00:24:39.630
of music: one,
in the Baroque period;

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.038
and two, right now.
 

00:24:43.038 --> 00:24:45.960
Because when you start
listening to your pop music--

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.853
go out there and listen to
those basses and start charting

00:24:48.853 --> 00:24:51.288
those basses and see how
repetitious they are.

00:24:51.288 --> 00:24:53.958
When Frederick Evans brought in
that piece of 'N Sync or

00:24:53.958 --> 00:24:56.867
whatever it was that he brought
in and I started listening to

00:24:56.867 --> 00:24:58.227
that I thought:
"My God,

00:24:58.227 --> 00:25:00.410
he's got a descending
tetrachord bass,

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.259
ostinato,
embedded in that."

00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:04.152
Now I'm sure Frederick didn't
sit there scratching:

00:25:04.152 --> 00:25:05.513
"Oh, yes,
there is my descending

00:25:05.513 --> 00:25:07.478
tetrachord--
chromatic descending tetrachord

00:25:07.478 --> 00:25:09.098
bass there,"
but it's in there.

00:25:09.098 --> 00:25:11.768
It's embedded in so much of
this popular music and that's

00:25:11.768 --> 00:25:14.390
kind of what we're going to
track here a little bit,

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.868
but we're going to start with
the Baroque.

00:25:16.868 --> 00:25:19.558
So we can start with--who is
the best or the--yeah,

00:25:19.558 --> 00:25:22.410
we could even say the best
composer of the Baroque.

00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.226
Well, J.S. Bach,
so let's start with an organ

00:25:25.226 --> 00:25:27.530
piece of Bach,
and we'll listen to an

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:29.259
ostinato bass.
 

00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:32.642
Generally speaking in music,
when you get an ostinato

00:25:32.642 --> 00:25:34.190
it's applied to the bass.
 

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.105
It sets up a repeating harmony
so that's what we've got here so

00:25:38.105 --> 00:25:41.010
here is a passacaglia,
just a little bit of it,

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:41.769
by Bach.
 

00:25:41.769 --> 00:26:23.180
&gt;
 

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.698
So let's pause it there,
and you can see what he's doing

00:26:26.698 --> 00:26:30.471
once he gets his bass in there,
and it's a typical eight-bar

00:26:30.471 --> 00:26:31.240
pattern.
 

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.180
It's odd how many of these
ostinato basses are in

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.470
eight-bar units.
 

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:37.890
So it's an eight-bar pattern
here with Bach.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.250
Then all he does is keep
throwing over top of that

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:45.160
different rhythmic patterns and
slightly different melodic

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.842
patterns as well,
but that bass

00:26:49.842 --> 00:26:55.210
&gt;
 

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:59.166
keeps churning away over and
over underneath in that piece

00:26:59.166 --> 00:27:01.318
for what instrument,
by Bach?

00:27:01.318 --> 00:27:04.905
Organ, big, powerful pipe
organ, that wonderful,

00:27:04.905 --> 00:27:06.278
wonderful sound.
 

00:27:06.278 --> 00:27:06.865
All right.
 

00:27:06.865 --> 00:27:09.443
So that's an introduction to
the basso

00:27:09.443 --> 00:27:11.847
ostinato,
the ostinato bass,

00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:12.608
by Bach.
 

00:27:12.608 --> 00:27:15.640
Let's turn to some music now of
Henry Purcell.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.351
Henry Purcell was an English
composer working in London at

00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:21.759
the end of the seventeenth
century.

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:24.840
He was employed by--it must
have been James the Second,

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.522
and then, I think,
William and Mary for a little

00:27:27.522 --> 00:27:27.980
bit.
 

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:32.150
So he wrote for the court and
he also wrote for the theater.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.576
And in one instance,
and it turned out to be his

00:27:34.576 --> 00:27:37.759
most famous composition,
he wrote an opera for an

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:42.160
all-girls boarding school in the
London suburb of Chelsea.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.430
I guess it's now part of
downtown London.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.007
There's a famous soccer team,
Chelsea something.

00:27:47.007 --> 00:27:47.829
I don't know.
 

00:27:47.829 --> 00:27:49.318
You see them on TV.
 

00:27:49.318 --> 00:27:53.344
So there is Henry Purcell out
at this all-girl boarding school

00:27:53.344 --> 00:27:55.720
and annually they put on a
drama,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.761
so it was kind of like the
senior class play and all of the

00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:04.012
roles were sung by women except
in this case one role was sung

00:28:04.012 --> 00:28:07.220
by a male and that was the role
of Aeneas.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.440
So we've got the famous story
of Dido and Aeneas.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:14.775
You've probably read it in
literature classes and you've

00:28:14.775 --> 00:28:17.019
probably read parts of it in
Latin.

00:28:17.019 --> 00:28:21.544
It's from Book IV and it used
to be in a really good

00:28:21.544 --> 00:28:23.940
secondary-type education.
 

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.779
When you were doing Latin and
you've had maybe six or seven

00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:31.686
years of Latin you would read
the--Virgil's Aeneid in

00:28:31.686 --> 00:28:33.210
the original Latin.
 

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.140
Anybody do that in your--wow.
 

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.380
Holy shmoly.
 

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.210
Latin is making a serious
comeback here.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:41.619
Because it's not easy.
 

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:43.400
It's not easy stuff.
 

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.327
It's traditional classical
Latin where the syntax is

00:28:47.327 --> 00:28:51.409
radically different than
medieval Latin or any kind of

00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:52.950
modern language.
 

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:54.269
Okay. Well, good for you guys.
 

00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:56.279
So you know the story.
 

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:57.490
Somebody tell me the story then.
 

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:58.960
Michael, what's the story?
 

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:08.470
Student:
&gt;

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.750
and Aeneas has to leave
&gt;

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:11.532
Prof: Okay.
 

00:29:11.532 --> 00:29:13.450
So Aeneas has to leave for
another country.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.960
It happens to be what country?
 

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.538
Student: Rome.
 

00:29:15.538 --> 00:29:16.539
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:19.984
He's got to follow his destiny
and go off and found the city of

00:29:19.984 --> 00:29:23.041
Rome and, in the vernacular,
having ditched Dido back in

00:29:23.041 --> 00:29:23.819
Carthage.
 

00:29:23.819 --> 00:29:25.609
She's not happy about this.
 

00:29:25.609 --> 00:29:27.348
She dies.
 

00:29:27.348 --> 00:29:31.298
Depending upon the theatrical
version or the original,

00:29:31.298 --> 00:29:34.560
she either stabs herself,
falls on a burning funeral pyre

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.750
or dies of a broken heart,
but this is opera so you know

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.133
that at the end of it the
soprano's got to die.

00:29:40.133 --> 00:29:40.599
Right?
 

00:29:40.599 --> 00:29:41.559
This is the way operas die.
 

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:44.038
Operas end--die, dead.
 

00:29:44.038 --> 00:29:45.957
So anyway you could do
Violetta,

00:29:45.957 --> 00:29:48.380
in Traviata--you could
do Tosca.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.722
In Tosca--we've even
seen here the Liebestod

00:29:51.722 --> 00:29:54.068
at the end of Wagner's
Tristan.

00:29:54.068 --> 00:29:58.156
Isolde dies after singing the
Liebestod--expires

00:29:58.156 --> 00:30:01.108
there--so it's a convention of
opera.

00:30:01.108 --> 00:30:04.420
And in this particular opera we
have a famous aria.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.476
It's called "Dido's
Lament" where she is

00:30:07.476 --> 00:30:11.220
lamenting the fact that she has
been abandoned by Aeneas,

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.403
and it's interesting because
it's built on an ostinato

00:30:14.403 --> 00:30:17.586
bass line and it's built on an
ostinato bass line that

00:30:17.586 --> 00:30:21.746
descends,
and this is important because

00:30:21.746 --> 00:30:26.460
it became a convention for
lamentation.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:40.920
So this is the bass line for
"Dido's Lament"

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:48.558
here &gt;
 

00:30:48.558 --> 00:30:52.089
and it just keeps recycling
over and over and over again.

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:53.740
That's the ostinato.
 

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:56.717
And then up above that we have
the lamentation,

00:30:56.717 --> 00:31:00.664
"When I am laid in earth,
may my wrongs create no trouble

00:31:00.664 --> 00:31:01.828
in thy breast.
 

00:31:01.828 --> 00:31:03.290
Remember me,
remember me,

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:03.839
but ah!
 

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:05.269
Forget my fate."
 

00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:08.942
So that's what she's singing,
so let's listen to a bit of

00:31:08.942 --> 00:31:12.748
this and before we do that we
have the term on the board up

00:31:12.748 --> 00:31:14.900
there,
"ground bass."

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.930
All that is is the English term
for ostinato bass--

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.567
ground bass,
ostinato bass,

00:31:19.567 --> 00:31:21.888
the same thing,
but it gives us the sense at

00:31:21.888 --> 00:31:24.700
least that the bass grounds;
it kind of holds together.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.480
It's the foundation for the
entire composition.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.962
So let's listen and we'll start
with the ground bass and--and

00:31:31.962 --> 00:31:34.279
then the singer will come in.
 

00:31:34.279 --> 00:32:15.859
&gt;
 

00:32:15.859 --> 00:32:18.380
Okay. Let's stop it there.
 

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.351
So that's how this plays out
and that bass keeps cycling

00:32:21.351 --> 00:32:23.890
through the duration of this
particular aria.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.326
Listening to this recording
gives us the opportunity to

00:32:27.326 --> 00:32:29.490
think about approaches to music.
 

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.413
This is a piece written at the
end of the seventeenth century

00:32:32.413 --> 00:32:35.385
and actually in this particular
recording they're playing this

00:32:35.385 --> 00:32:38.455
and singing in a way that would
be rather similar to the way the

00:32:38.455 --> 00:32:40.990
would have done it in the
seventeenth century.

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.634
They have reproductions of
seventeenth-century instruments,

00:32:44.634 --> 00:32:48.465
and the singer here is trying
to create a particular approach,

00:32:48.465 --> 00:32:50.098
vocally, to the music.
 

00:32:50.098 --> 00:32:53.647
So as we listen to this
recording one more time we're

00:32:53.647 --> 00:32:57.878
going to hear just a little bit
more of it and then we're going

00:32:57.878 --> 00:33:02.108
to ask you to compare this
recording to another recording.

00:33:02.108 --> 00:33:05.546
This would be the kind of thing
that a reviewer would do,

00:33:05.546 --> 00:33:08.430
so let's listen to a bit more
of this recording,

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.130
A we'll call it,
and then we'll move on.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:43.980
&gt;
 

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.521
All right.
 

00:33:44.521 --> 00:33:47.345
Let's pause it there,
and now we're going to go on to

00:33:47.345 --> 00:33:48.160
recording B.
 

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.413
So what's the difference here
in approach in terms of

00:33:52.413 --> 00:33:57.321
orchestra--everything--voice,
and how does recording B differ

00:33:57.321 --> 00:33:59.039
from recording A?
 

00:33:59.039 --> 00:35:01.199
&gt;
 

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.090
So maybe we'll pause it there.
 

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.849
What's your reaction to that?
 

00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:07.340
How do those two differ?
 

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.349
Hands, please. Caroline.
 

00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:12.570
Student:
&gt;

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:13.911
Prof: Okay.
 

00:35:13.911 --> 00:35:18.164
The first singer had a much
more youthful approach and you

00:35:18.164 --> 00:35:22.789
could see that as an attempt to
maybe duplicate the performance

00:35:22.789 --> 00:35:27.190
context of the original
performance in a high school--

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:30.650
a girls' school there in late
seventeenth-century London.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:34.394
More specifically,
what about the quality of that

00:35:34.394 --> 00:35:35.019
voice?
 

00:35:35.019 --> 00:35:36.559
Any thoughts?
 

00:35:36.559 --> 00:35:38.539
Roger.
 

00:35:38.539 --> 00:35:40.449
Student:
&gt;

00:35:40.449 --> 00:35:41.650
Prof: Okay.
 

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.050
Now, so we have the two
recordings.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.420
Which of the two had more
vibrato?

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.530
One or two?
 

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.320
Student: Two.
 

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.512
Prof: Two had a lot more
vibrato so that's really the big

00:35:53.512 --> 00:35:56.400
difference here,
that one was a very

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.498
well-focused voice with very
little vibrato and maybe that's

00:36:00.498 --> 00:36:03.070
what gave it this youthful
appeal.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:05.992
It's almost like the voice of a
choir boy or a choir girl for

00:36:05.992 --> 00:36:08.682
heaven's sakes,
a pre-adolescent child,

00:36:08.682 --> 00:36:13.177
but intending to make it very
pure and very clean and very

00:36:13.177 --> 00:36:14.440
well-focused.
 

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.396
The second
recording--what--that might be a

00:36:17.396 --> 00:36:21.829
recording that you would expect
to hear--a performance you would

00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:23.590
expect to hear where?
 

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:28.103
Maybe in a modern opera theater
or an opera hall,

00:36:28.103 --> 00:36:33.748
a hall designed for opera where
they've got this huge expanse

00:36:33.748 --> 00:36:36.099
that we have to fill.
 

00:36:36.099 --> 00:36:38.670
What about the orchestra?
 

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.099
Frederick.
 

00:36:41.099 --> 00:36:46.018
Student: It seems like
the second piece the bass line

00:36:46.018 --> 00:36:49.617
was more tenor,
slightly higher ostinato

00:36:49.617 --> 00:36:52.568
than the other one,
and it seemed like the

00:36:52.568 --> 00:36:55.139
repetition was a little bit
higher--

00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:57.139
Prof: You mean higher in
terms of pitch?

00:36:57.139 --> 00:36:57.929
Student: Yes.
 

00:36:57.929 --> 00:36:59.889
Prof: Frederick,
you have a very good ear.

00:36:59.889 --> 00:37:00.980
Actually, that's true.
 

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.192
There's--I don't want to get
into this, but the first

00:37:04.192 --> 00:37:07.960
recording is pitched in F-sharp,
in the old Baroque tuning.

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.150
They're trying really to be so
authentic.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:15.239
Pitch in the Baroque era was
actually lower than it is today.

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:17.460
We know that because there are
tuning forks that survived from

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:17.969
that period.
 

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:21.123
They got labeled on it A--you
play that A and it turns out to

00:37:21.123 --> 00:37:23.202
be our G-sharp,
so aficionados of this

00:37:23.202 --> 00:37:26.192
particular repertoire when they
go to perform Baroque music

00:37:26.192 --> 00:37:28.561
they're going to use
reproductions of authentic

00:37:28.561 --> 00:37:30.298
instruments,
they're going to use

00:37:30.298 --> 00:37:32.295
non-vibrato singing,
and they're going to use the

00:37:32.295 --> 00:37:32.809
lower pitch.
 

00:37:32.809 --> 00:37:36.097
I didn't plan on getting into
that but since you picked up on

00:37:36.097 --> 00:37:37.139
it, good for you.
 

00:37:37.139 --> 00:37:38.539
No, we don't have to get into
that,

00:37:38.539 --> 00:37:40.956
and to be honest with you,
the only reason I remembered

00:37:40.956 --> 00:37:43.704
that was I went to duplicate--
before coming in here today,

00:37:43.704 --> 00:37:46.289
I went to duplicate those
pitches on the piano so I'd be

00:37:46.289 --> 00:37:48.449
up to speed with this and I
realized geez,

00:37:48.449 --> 00:37:51.405
that I'd have to do this in
F-sharp and that's going to

00:37:51.405 --> 00:37:54.632
require some quick transposition
up here because I can do it

00:37:54.632 --> 00:37:57.369
quickly in G with only two flats
but F-sharp,

00:37:57.369 --> 00:37:59.130
how many sharps that I've got
there,

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:00.670
and I had to figure all of this
out,

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.250
so--but that is going on there.
 

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:03.780
That's an interesting
development, yeah.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.556
Anything else?
 

00:38:04.556 --> 00:38:06.389
What about the tempo of the
two?

00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:12.106
Size of the orchestra always
determines to some degree the

00:38:12.106 --> 00:38:12.909
tempo.
 

00:38:12.909 --> 00:38:14.159
Oscar.
 

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:15.179
Student: Slower.
 

00:38:15.179 --> 00:38:16.501
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:19.289
The second recording was much
slower.

00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:22.512
You--I was intentionally trying
to beat it up here to--and it

00:38:22.512 --> 00:38:24.340
was a very labored beat pattern.
 

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.650
It was much slower because they
had many more instruments,

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:31.360
a lot more people playing,
axiomatic--

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:34.271
the more people you have,
the longer it takes for sound

00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:36.581
to clear,
the slower your tempo will go

00:38:36.581 --> 00:38:39.847
unless you have a maniacally
dictatorial type of conductor

00:38:39.847 --> 00:38:41.510
that will really push you.
 

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.128
So it leads to--the more
people, the slower the tempo is

00:38:45.128 --> 00:38:46.050
going to go.
 

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:48.599
So what we have here is a
reproduction--

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:51.385
an attempt to reproduce an
authentic seventeenth-century

00:38:51.385 --> 00:38:53.920
performance as opposed to a
modern performance,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.980
big sound, metropolitan opera
type of sound.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:39:00.400
All right. Let's move on here.
 

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.300
One of the interesting aspect
of this--

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.110
I discovered this driving down
Whitney Avenue--

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.320
this is true--driving down
Whitney Avenue one day,

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:10.445
I must have been fishing for
ninety-one point five on my FM

00:39:10.445 --> 00:39:13.789
dial and suddenly had a seizure
or something and I didn't quite

00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:16.161
make it,
and I was listening to Elton

00:39:16.161 --> 00:39:16.518
John.
 

00:39:16.518 --> 00:39:22.018
Okay, listening to Elton John,
and what did I hear but the

00:39:22.018 --> 00:39:23.659
craziest thing.
 

00:39:23.659 --> 00:39:29.534
What I heard was this text:
It's sad, it's sad,

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:34.898
it's a sad, sad situation,
and then I heard

00:39:34.898 --> 00:39:38.219
&gt;.
 

00:39:38.219 --> 00:39:39.132
I said, "Whoa.
 

00:39:39.132 --> 00:39:40.139
Wait a minute there.
 

00:39:40.139 --> 00:39:44.250
That's the Purcell bass line.
 

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:47.780
Elton John has stolen the
Purcell bass line.

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:48.780
Arrest that man!"
 

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:48.987
No.
 

00:39:48.987 --> 00:39:52.880
We don't do this because,
as we say, these bass lines are

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.550
in the common domain.
 

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:57.333
As we have said before,
we can't sue anybody for the

00:39:57.333 --> 00:40:00.773
theft of a bass line and indeed
it was all over the place in the

00:40:00.773 --> 00:40:01.429
Baroque.
 

00:40:01.429 --> 00:40:05.820
This is a type of--it became a
kind of musical icon.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:15.320
Any time an audience would hear
&gt;

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.893
they would think death or bad
news, and actually,

00:40:19.893 --> 00:40:21.800
we still do today.
 

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.032
Isn't "Hit the Road,
Jack" based on that same

00:40:25.032 --> 00:40:26.889
kind of ostinato bass?
 

00:40:26.889 --> 00:40:29.554
But in the Baroque you could go
back to Monteverdi's

00:40:29.554 --> 00:40:31.329
"Lamento della Ninfa."
 

00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:33.436
You could go to Bach's cantata,
"Weinen,

00:40:33.436 --> 00:40:34.728
Klagen, Sorgen,
Zagen,"

00:40:34.728 --> 00:40:37.018
to whine,
kvetch, and you could go to the

00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:39.579
"Crucifixus"
in the Bach B Minor Mass.

00:40:39.579 --> 00:40:43.809
What could be more painful or
dispiriting than a crucifixion?

00:40:43.809 --> 00:40:45.889
So this was a moniker.
 

00:40:45.889 --> 00:40:49.478
It was a kind of emblem of
lamentation, whether it's in

00:40:49.478 --> 00:40:53.599
Purcell, whether it's in Bach or
whether it's in Elton John.

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:56.896
So then Elton John was to take
this and he used it not at the

00:40:56.896 --> 00:40:59.099
beginning of this piece,
"Sorry is the

00:40:59.099 --> 00:41:01.105
Saddest"--
or "Sorry is the Hardest

00:41:01.105 --> 00:41:02.000
Word to Say."
 

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.469
He didn't use it at the
beginning.

00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:05.030
He used it in the chorus.
 

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:08.092
So here we are in the chorus of
Elton John's--I think it's

00:41:08.092 --> 00:41:11.425
"Sorry is the Saddest Thing
to Say" or something like

00:41:11.425 --> 00:41:11.909
that.
 

00:41:11.909 --> 00:41:33.391
&gt;
 

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:49.690
&gt;
 

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.059
And then he goes on with the
next verse.

00:41:52.059 --> 00:41:52.429
Okay.
 

00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:56.494
So that's just one example of
the use of that particular

00:41:56.494 --> 00:41:58.268
ostinato bass.
 

00:41:58.268 --> 00:42:01.009
We actually call that a lament
bass and many--and Mozart even

00:42:01.009 --> 00:42:01.420
did it.
 

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:04.574
He wrote a violin sonata on the
occasion of his mother's death

00:42:04.574 --> 00:42:07.989
in E minor and he has that thing
just going down and descending.

00:42:07.989 --> 00:42:11.110
Basically, it's this descending
tetrachord chord here that gets

00:42:11.110 --> 00:42:12.420
filled in chromatically.
 

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:12.972
All right.
 

00:42:12.972 --> 00:42:15.518
So we've got that as an
ostinato bass.

00:42:15.518 --> 00:42:18.824
What's the most famous
ostinato bass of all

00:42:18.824 --> 00:42:20.579
time, Baroque or modern?
 

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:22.750
The Pachelbel bass.
 

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.976
Okay?
 

00:42:22.976 --> 00:42:25.929
And we've got this thing called
the "Pachelbel Canon."

00:42:25.929 --> 00:42:28.639
Do you have the Xerox for today?
 

00:42:28.639 --> 00:42:31.610
What's the "Pachelbel
Canon"?

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:34.099
Well, we've worked a little bit
with this.

00:42:34.099 --> 00:42:37.190
I think it was Listening
Exercise eight,

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:41.541
I believe, early on in the
course where we were trying to

00:42:41.541 --> 00:42:44.650
have you focus on changing
harmonies,

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:49.226
and these harmonies are just
generated by this repeating bass

00:42:49.226 --> 00:42:49.760
line.
 

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.503
There's an irony with the
"Pachelbel Canon"

00:42:53.503 --> 00:42:58.038
and that is that you never hear
the canon in the "Pachelbel

00:42:58.038 --> 00:42:59.190
Canon."
 

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.139
Why is that the case?
 

00:43:01.139 --> 00:43:06.130
It's because if you look he's
got these three canonic lines--

00:43:06.130 --> 00:43:10.590
the three staves up above--all
in the same register,

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.262
and when people record this
they always do it with the same

00:43:14.262 --> 00:43:16.469
instrument,
usually just with a violin,

00:43:16.469 --> 00:43:18.130
so we have the violins up
above,

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:21.219
three violins all playing in
the same register.

00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:23.099
You can't pick out the canon.
 

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:25.320
It just sounds like this
unfolding jumble.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:29.449
It's a very beautiful jumble
but it's indistinctive in that

00:43:29.449 --> 00:43:30.018
sense.
 

00:43:30.018 --> 00:43:32.400
Maybe if they orchestrated
oboe, flute and clarinet,

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.219
maybe we could hear the canon
better.

00:43:34.219 --> 00:43:37.572
What we hear,
of course, grinding away

00:43:37.572 --> 00:43:41.739
underneath is the
ostinato bass so let's

00:43:41.739 --> 00:43:44.730
listen to just a bit of this.
 

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:47.829
And I was struck the other day
when I went back and listened to

00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:49.280
this recording on your CDs.
 

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.644
They have put in this something
that's actually Pachelbel didn't

00:43:53.644 --> 00:43:54.199
write.
 

00:43:54.199 --> 00:43:59.822
When this starts out they just
start with a &lt;&lt;plays

00:43:59.822 --> 00:44:01.429
piano&gt;&gt;.
 

00:44:01.429 --> 00:44:03.489
What's that?
 

00:44:03.489 --> 00:44:09.389
&gt;
 

00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:12.764
It's a descending major scale
so they've just said,

00:44:12.764 --> 00:44:13.980
"All right.
 

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.150
Here's your basic tonality.
 

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:16.900
Here's your tonal grid or
whatever."

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.420
So let's listen to the bass
start out.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.237
Then we'll have this descending
scale that Pachelbel didn't

00:44:21.237 --> 00:44:24.150
write and then his canon will
start, and you can see how this

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.880
works here.
 

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.079
I've indicated A.
 

00:44:26.079 --> 00:44:28.739
A gets repeated as B comes in
and so on.

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:31.289
It's pretty straightforward how
the canon operates.

00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:41.190
&gt;
 

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:43.599
Okay. Here comes the scale now.
 

00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:53.280
&gt;
 

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:59.876
And now the canon starts:
A one, &lt;&lt;music

00:44:59.876 --> 00:45:02.369
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:45:02.369 --> 00:45:06.070
the second voice comes in,
&gt;

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.876
the first voice goes on to
present something new,

00:45:08.876 --> 00:45:09.110
B.
 

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:54.909
&gt;
 

00:45:54.909 --> 00:45:56.143
So we'll pause it here now.
 

00:45:56.143 --> 00:45:58.980
We're going to pause it here,
and it goes about four minutes.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:45:59.570
It is very beautiful.
 

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:00.731
It's lovely--lovely,
lovely, lovely,

00:46:00.731 --> 00:46:01.030
lovely.
 

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:04.869
But you know this bass line.
 

00:46:04.869 --> 00:46:05.829
Right?
 

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:07.139
&gt;
 

00:46:07.139 --> 00:46:08.889
Okay. So there's our D.
 

00:46:08.889 --> 00:46:10.219
Let's all sing it together.
 

00:46:10.219 --> 00:46:12.190
Ready, sing.
 

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:32.239
&gt;
 

00:46:32.239 --> 00:46:32.556
Okay.
 

00:46:32.556 --> 00:46:35.722
So once you get that in your
ear, you have a sense,

00:46:35.722 --> 00:46:39.268
oh, it's really in there and
that you may have heard that

00:46:39.268 --> 00:46:41.360
many different times before.
 

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.018
Now lots of people made use of
the "Pachelbel Canon"

00:46:45.018 --> 00:46:48.559
and I know of at least three
and maybe four that I've put up

00:46:48.559 --> 00:46:51.619
on the board up there and you
may know of more.

00:46:51.619 --> 00:46:57.199
Marcos sent me a YouTube clip
of a comedian.

00:46:57.199 --> 00:46:58.889
Maybe you guys have seen this.
 

00:46:58.889 --> 00:47:01.572
What was the comedian's name
who was made sort of so sick of

00:47:01.572 --> 00:47:04.391
the "Pachelbel Canon"
because every piece he picks up

00:47:04.391 --> 00:47:06.893
has got the bass line of the
"Pachelbel Canon"

00:47:06.893 --> 00:47:07.440
in it?
 

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.199
Who--what comedian was that?
 

00:47:09.199 --> 00:47:10.619
It doesn't matter.
 

00:47:10.619 --> 00:47:12.768
Okay. So those are my four.
 

00:47:12.768 --> 00:47:15.440
Anybody else know where else
they show up?

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.347
All right.
 

00:47:16.347 --> 00:47:19.885
Well, let's review,
but keep in the--oh,

00:47:19.885 --> 00:47:21.519
Thaddeus, good.
 

00:47:21.519 --> 00:47:22.849
Student: Britney Spears.
 

00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:25.369
Prof: Britney Spears has
the "Pachelbel Canon"?

00:47:25.369 --> 00:47:28.239
What a time to be alive. Wow.
 

00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:29.949
&gt;
 

00:47:29.949 --> 00:47:30.536
All right.
 

00:47:30.536 --> 00:47:32.300
Thaddeus, go get that for me.
 

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:33.360
I need this one.
 

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.969
This is gold.
 

00:47:34.969 --> 00:47:37.170
Thank you very much,
but so--but check it.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:39.822
For example,
one of the students,

00:47:39.822 --> 00:47:43.304
Daniel in here,
sent me--or gave me--and we

00:47:43.304 --> 00:47:47.119
talked about it,
and let's go to that one.

00:47:47.119 --> 00:47:54.304
The--it's--He said this may be
a knockoff of the

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:58.889
"Pachelbel Canon."
 

00:47:58.889 --> 00:48:01.380
It's called the "Taco Bell
Canon."

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.855
So let's see if the
"Pachelbel Canon"

00:48:04.855 --> 00:48:08.860
is in fact embedded in the
"Taco Bell Canon"

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:09.539
here.
 

00:48:09.539 --> 00:48:44.480
&gt;
 

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:44.938
Okay.
 

00:48:44.938 --> 00:48:47.789
So is that the Pachelbel bass?
 

00:48:47.789 --> 00:49:01.559
&gt;
 

00:49:01.559 --> 00:49:02.730
Is that the pattern you were
singing?

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:03.630
Yes or no?
 

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:04.699
How many think yes?
 

00:49:04.699 --> 00:49:05.840
Raise your right hand.
 

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.860
How many think no?
 

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.829
Raise your left hand.
 

00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:11.420
No, it ain't the
"Pachelbel Canon."

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:13.050
Is it an ostinato bass?
 

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:15.889
Yes, it's an ostinato
bass.

00:49:15.889 --> 00:49:19.309
So we could keep playing with
that.

00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:21.985
I could play you Coolio,
Blues Traveler,

00:49:21.985 --> 00:49:22.809
Vitamin C.
 

00:49:22.809 --> 00:49:27.449
Just for laughs let's do
Vitamin C.

00:49:27.449 --> 00:49:31.853
You've--and I'm sorry about
this but it's too good to pass

00:49:31.853 --> 00:49:32.239
up.
 

00:49:32.239 --> 00:49:33.769
Okay. So out you go.
 

00:49:33.769 --> 00:49:34.889
Thanks for your attention.
 

00:49:34.889 --> 00:49:39.130
&gt;
 

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:42.054

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.730
Prof: While we get
settled, in our,

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.545
as usual, gradual fashion,
I'm going to turn on one of the

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:12.770
videos involving the last two
CEOs of Polaroid,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.394
and then after that,
we'll get into our normal

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:17.200
routine.
 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:06:56.230
 
 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.759
What did you think of those
guys?

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:02.980
Did you like them?
 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:16.850
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.269
Prof: Great.
 

00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:22.350
We're going to see part of each
slide--there we go.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:28.139
We've got two cases this week,
Polaroid and Enron.

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:34.730
They are two cases of dramatic
success and then dramatic

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:35.930
failure.
 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:42.002
In understanding capitalism,
think back to everything we've

00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:43.470
done so far.
 

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:50.817
The idea of abrupt change,
of equilibrium always being

00:07:50.817 --> 00:07:55.829
dislodged,
equilibrium always disrupted,

00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:02.470
and the cardiothoracic systems
case from the end of last week

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:08.372
was exactly such a story,
and Polaroid is very much such

00:08:08.372 --> 00:08:09.180
a story.
 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.709
Enron has a darker cast to it.
 

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:21.540
It entails the darker side of
the human soul.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.843
And we'll hear about that from
Jim Alexander,

00:08:25.843 --> 00:08:29.757
who lived right through the
middle of it,

00:08:29.757 --> 00:08:31.420
on Wednesday.
 

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:42.376
This is a tracing of the sales
volume of Polaroid from 1957

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:47.288
until the firm's demise.
 

00:08:47.288 --> 00:08:53.346
One of the things you can--that
is of interest about this

00:08:53.346 --> 00:08:59.404
diagram, is that the sales at
death were not dramatically

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:02.649
below their all time peak.
 

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:11.006
So sales alone don't tell you
enough to understand what

00:09:11.006 --> 00:09:12.710
happened.
 

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:20.011
This is the stock price,
and this is--what are stock

00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:22.159
prices about?
 

00:09:22.159 --> 00:09:29.750
What are the drivers?
 

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.558
I'm not asking for anything
fancy here.

00:09:31.558 --> 00:09:34.519
What are the drivers--yes,
back left.

00:09:34.519 --> 00:09:39.279
Student:  It's expected
future dividends.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:42.702
Prof: Okay,
expected future earnings,

00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:46.923
along with some special sauce
having to do with future

00:09:46.923 --> 00:09:49.870
strategy to maintain share
price.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.710
Student:  Interest rates.
 

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.658
Prof: How would interest
rates play into this?

00:09:57.658 --> 00:10:00.556
Student:  Basically,
formulaically,

00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:04.575
the expectations--
Prof: Okay--just for

00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:09.739
those of us who are from
Illinois, spell it out a little

00:10:09.739 --> 00:10:10.960
at a time.
 

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.000
Who's from Illinois here?
 

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.788
I apologize.
 

00:10:13.788 --> 00:10:18.269
Hell, I should have said
Indiana, I'm from there.

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:20.960
Okay, spell it out for us.
 

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.264
Student:  A lower
interest rate will yield a

00:10:24.264 --> 00:10:28.096
higher stock price because there
will be less of a tradeoff

00:10:28.096 --> 00:10:31.600
between spending today and what
you get tomorrow.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.860
Prof: Well, sort of.
 

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.158
Jim do you want to help with
that?

00:10:39.158 --> 00:10:43.230
Jim Alexander:
 They really are a

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:48.970
projection of future cash flows
to the shareholders,

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.970
it's just that it used to be in
the 1950s,

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.495
1960s, and 1970s,
dividends that were the bulk of

00:10:55.495 --> 00:10:59.062
those assumptions,
and today it's a rare company

00:10:59.062 --> 00:11:02.971
that makes more than 1% or 2%
dividend yield on the stock

00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:03.600
price.
 

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.509
So really it's a projection of
earnings which is encapsulated.

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:10.744
When you look at that chart,
what you see is the typical

00:11:10.744 --> 00:11:15.364
problem with a lot of growth
stocks and that is people buying

00:11:15.364 --> 00:11:19.828
onto a whole new paradigm and
then extrapolates for decades

00:11:19.828 --> 00:11:23.909
and you end up with a stock
price that really bears no

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:26.990
resemblance to current earnings.
 

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.138
Prof: And an increase in
interest rates,

00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:31.090
how would that view--
Jim Alexander:

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.202
 That would--
an increase in--all of the

00:11:33.202 --> 00:11:35.943
things being equal--
an increase in current interest

00:11:35.943 --> 00:11:39.206
rates would lower the stock
price because you would have to

00:11:39.206 --> 00:11:42.639
be compensated for the extra
time value of money involved.

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:45.149
Prof: Thanks.
 

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:53.988
Sales, this is a curve in red
that we saw in the first slide,

00:11:53.988 --> 00:11:58.850
with long term debt superposed.
 

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:05.220
Sales reads on the left axis
and debt reads on the right.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:10.038
Anything learned from that
slide?

00:12:10.038 --> 00:12:18.418
Come on guys,
this is not a curve ball.

00:12:18.418 --> 00:12:24.150
Student:  Polaroid
didn't have any debt until

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:28.759
relatively recently in the last
second.

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:31.467
Pretty much starting during the
recession of the recession of

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:34.538
the 1980s
Prof: Was the debt

00:12:34.538 --> 00:12:39.090
likely to be important there
toward the end?

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.859
Student:  Well,
yeah, because they filed for

00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:41.320
bankruptcy.
 

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.269
Prof: They did.
 

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:46.308
And what was the precise event
that caused them to file?

00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:51.928
It's the 10Q filing in the
case, did anybody notice that?

00:12:51.928 --> 00:12:53.509
Student:  A takeover
attempt.

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:55.090
Prof: No.
 

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.820
Student: 
&gt;

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.399
Prof: Seaconch.
 

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:02.409
Student:  9/11.
 

00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:04.250
Prof: Not really.
 

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.110
It was related to 9/11.
 

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:11.292
What happened was,
they failed to make a scheduled

00:13:11.292 --> 00:13:15.817
payment on the debt and that
triggered an avalanche of

00:13:15.817 --> 00:13:20.009
adverse results,
drove the stock price close to

00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:24.480
zero,
and how does the firm end up?

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.149
What becomes of it?
 

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:33.200
It gets--sold?
 

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.428
Student:  Sold to the
private equity companies.

00:13:37.428 --> 00:13:41.078
Prof: Sold to private
equity, and how much of its

00:13:41.078 --> 00:13:44.994
value do you think is--of its
peak value is there at the end

00:13:44.994 --> 00:13:47.450
when it's sold to private
equity?

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:54.899
You don't have to give me a
number, just give me a lot/a

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:58.629
little--
Student:  I think 20%.

00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:02.096
Prof: I think less,
it sold for $265 million at

00:14:02.096 --> 00:14:03.210
that end stage.
 

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.409
Now what was the value
proposition?

00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:09.000
I guess that's a hint.
 

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.080
What would have caused
you--here is a Polaroid Pronto,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.970
which hasn't made a picture in
a lifetime,

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:24.442
what would it have cost--I
probably bought over the years

00:14:24.442 --> 00:14:27.080
three or four of these cameras.
 

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:31.620
I was never terrifically happy
with them.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.940
Any of you ever own one?
 

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.419
You're all way too
young--almost all.

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:40.994
Tell us--
Student:  Yeah,

00:14:40.994 --> 00:14:47.534
I got one as a birthday present
as a novelty for like,

00:14:47.534 --> 00:14:49.509
three months.
 

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:51.950
Prof: How old were you?
 

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:53.538
Student:  I was eight.
 

00:14:53.538 --> 00:14:56.267
Prof: So you probably
didn't have an independent

00:14:56.267 --> 00:14:57.580
account for buying film?
 

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.379
Do you have any memory of how
the film's price compared--well

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:04.620
you didn't buy the camera.
 

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.136
Student:  No,
I didn't know anything about

00:15:06.136 --> 00:15:06.580
the pricing.
 

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:08.690
I just liked that it came out
instantly.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.654
Prof: Okay,
did anyone own one at an age

00:15:11.654 --> 00:15:12.879
older than eight?
 

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:19.020
Back center--
Student:  I had my

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.710
grandmother's old one.
 

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:26.230
I was 11.
 

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.788
Prof: I can guess what
you paid for the camera.

00:15:28.788 --> 00:15:30.889
Student:  I mean it was
a hand me down,

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:33.203
and I took, like,
ten pictures,

00:15:33.203 --> 00:15:37.139
and I asked my mom to buy more
and she was like,

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:38.908
"No, we're just going to
get a disposable."

00:15:38.908 --> 00:15:43.703
Prof: Okay,
so the sales metaphor in the

00:15:43.703 --> 00:15:49.331
case, anybody remember what
analogy do they draw in the

00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:51.730
marketing strategy?
 

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.908
Student:  I think it was
razor and blade.

00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:57.830
Prof: Razor and blade,
help us understand that.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.288
Student:  Yeah,
basically the current interest

00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:01.990
of the company that sells
razors,

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.174
they're not making that much
money on the actual price of the

00:16:04.174 --> 00:16:06.215
razors,
some could argue that they can

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:07.500
even give that to you.
 

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.139
Their profit really comes from
that people have to buy blades

00:16:11.139 --> 00:16:12.840
in order to use the razor.
 

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.610
Prof: Okay, great.
 

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.114
Can we think of any other
analogies in marketing

00:16:18.114 --> 00:16:19.360
strategies?
 

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.889
Here in the alligator shirt.
 

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:24.058
Student:  Printers and
ink cartridges.

00:16:24.058 --> 00:16:25.899
Prof: Printers and
cartridges.

00:16:25.899 --> 00:16:29.360
You've noticed that the
printers sell for nothing,

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.678
and the cartridges cost your
firstborn child.

00:16:32.678 --> 00:16:39.940
It's not a bad strategy because
most of us try to minimize the

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:47.201
initial cash outlay when we buy
something and then you get hit

00:16:47.201 --> 00:16:53.509
in the back of the head by the
maintenance of it.

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:59.240
And that was the strategy for
Polaroid, and it was in some

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.960
periods a very successful
strategy.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.788
What's the value proposition?
 

00:17:06.788 --> 00:17:10.680
We get two dimensions here,
let's put them together,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.519
actually.
 

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:20.048
The quality dimension,
I think this is 1948;

00:17:20.048 --> 00:17:24.278
this is the first Polaroid
camera on the retail market.

00:17:24.278 --> 00:17:29.976
It was much too--I was nine at
the time, so I can empathize

00:17:29.976 --> 00:17:34.001
with you guys,
but I was nowhere near rich

00:17:34.001 --> 00:17:38.519
enough to purchase a Polaroid
Land camera.

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:41.858
It was a very upscale,
fancy idea.

00:17:41.858 --> 00:17:48.941
But I did see pictures made
with it, and they were sepia

00:17:48.941 --> 00:17:53.548
tone and muddy;
very low contrast.

00:17:53.548 --> 00:17:58.768
They were very bad compared
with what could be produced by

00:17:58.768 --> 00:18:01.240
conventional photography.
 

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:08.298
The question was--let's think
about three kinds of consumers,

00:18:08.298 --> 00:18:13.240
and this was largely a consumer
product.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:16.390
It had scientific and business
applications,

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.963
and industrial applications,
but from Land's point of view

00:18:20.963 --> 00:18:25.778
all the way the real darling was
the amateur photographer.

00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:35.798
Let's use indifference curves
in this space,

00:18:35.798 --> 00:18:39.140
so we've got speed on the
horizontal dimension and quality

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.836
on the vertical dimension,
and a person who says,

00:18:43.836 --> 00:18:51.190
"I'm indifferent between
all these outcomes,"

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:58.000
how would we describe that
person's preference?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.519
Student:  A professional.
 

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:01.778
If he's indifferent to speed;
there's a

00:19:01.778 --> 00:19:03.279
&gt;
 

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:04.400
of quality.
 

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.509
Prof: I'm unable to
locate you.

00:19:05.509 --> 00:19:06.140
Where are you?
 

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:06.690
Wave.
 

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.410
Oh, hi.
 

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.670
It would be a professional or
perfectionist.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:15.778
The model might be Ansel Adams,
somebody who makes wonderful

00:19:15.778 --> 00:19:21.027
pictures and is willing to wait,
and is virtually indifferent to

00:19:21.027 --> 00:19:24.108
the time dimension,
so that person is trying to

00:19:24.108 --> 00:19:26.730
climb in this direction,
indifference curve over

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:27.690
indifference curve.
 

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:36.578
This person--Tim what's this
person up too?

00:19:36.578 --> 00:19:42.680
They're trying to go out that
way as fast as they can.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.805
Student:  They're trying
to get faster and faster

00:19:47.805 --> 00:19:48.828
pictures.
 

00:19:48.828 --> 00:19:50.240
Prof: Yeah,
cheap thrills,

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.490
just like our friend back here
when he was eight.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.848
All they want is speed.
 

00:19:55.848 --> 00:19:58.233
How many customers do you think
fit either of these

00:19:58.233 --> 00:19:58.950
descriptions?
 

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:03.349
A few fit the first
description, a few fit the

00:20:03.349 --> 00:20:08.240
second description,
but most are more like this.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:11.167
They have a tradeoff,
which I've simplified with

00:20:11.167 --> 00:20:14.219
straight lines,
they probably would actually

00:20:14.219 --> 00:20:16.769
bow in toward the origin like
this,

00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:23.993
but these people want some
combination of speed and

00:20:23.993 --> 00:20:25.440
quality.
 

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:33.988
The central drive for the
Polaroid Land Camera from 1948

00:20:33.988 --> 00:20:40.720
all the way to the end,
was to do as well as possible

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:46.377
in competing for the business of
these people who were trading

00:20:46.377 --> 00:20:48.788
off the two dimensions.
 

00:20:48.788 --> 00:20:54.830
The SX-70, which was in some
ways, the high point of

00:20:54.830 --> 00:21:01.108
Polaroid's history and in other
ways the low point.

00:21:01.108 --> 00:21:04.740
Anybody remember what was wrong
with the SX-70?

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:09.450
Student:  It had battery
problems.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:13.384
Prof: It had--how--do
you remember from the case how

00:21:13.384 --> 00:21:16.029
the battery was related to the
thing?

00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:19.230
Student:  Not really.
 

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:22.982
Prof: I think Jim
Alexander and I are the only

00:21:22.982 --> 00:21:25.868
people here who ever experienced
this.

00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:30.265
The battery was included in the
film pack, and for the first

00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:34.586
couple of years they made it,
about half the batteries were

00:21:34.586 --> 00:21:35.480
no good.
 

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:39.857
If you spent a premium for the
film pack and the battery

00:21:39.857 --> 00:21:44.077
wouldn't make the camera run,
you were likely to be an

00:21:44.077 --> 00:21:45.750
unhappy customer.
 

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:50.750
They had a very high complaint
rate about that.

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:58.942
Does anybody remember what they
did to resolve the battery

00:21:58.942 --> 00:22:00.380
problem?
 

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.942
Student:  They
manufactured their own

00:22:01.942 --> 00:22:02.380
batteries.
 

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.498
Prof: Yeah,
they went into the battery

00:22:04.498 --> 00:22:07.913
manufacturing business,
which is as we'll see in a

00:22:07.913 --> 00:22:12.518
minute, is an integration move,
where they reduce their

00:22:12.518 --> 00:22:17.205
reliance on outside suppliers
but create a whole set of new

00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:21.138
problems for themselves,
because it turns out it's not

00:22:21.138 --> 00:22:23.500
very easy to manufacture
batteries well.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:29.905
The Polaroid SX-70 had gained
enormous ground on conventional

00:22:29.905 --> 00:22:34.068
photography on the quality
dimension.

00:22:34.068 --> 00:22:37.440
It was a lot better than the
old Polaroid,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:45.834
but it was still--nobody drunk
or sober would argue that the

00:22:45.834 --> 00:22:53.518
pictures produced by the
Polaroid SX-70 were as good as

00:22:53.518 --> 00:23:00.490
those produced by a conventional
single SLR,

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:06.108
single lens reflex 35mm camera
with competent processing.

00:23:06.108 --> 00:23:10.876
They were in a position where
they had a deficit on the

00:23:10.876 --> 00:23:14.231
quality side,
which they never actually

00:23:14.231 --> 00:23:15.380
overcame.
 

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.969
They did better and better on
picture quality but they never

00:23:18.969 --> 00:23:22.618
really got to where they matched
conventional photography.

00:23:22.618 --> 00:23:27.044
The--I've drawn this so that
they're on a higher indifference

00:23:27.044 --> 00:23:31.099
curve for this particular
consumer than the conventional

00:23:31.099 --> 00:23:32.278
photography.
 

00:23:32.278 --> 00:23:37.538
There were several problems
lurking in that.

00:23:37.538 --> 00:23:44.078
One of them--how could this
have happened?

00:23:44.078 --> 00:23:48.551
Without any improvement in
either the film or the camera on

00:23:48.551 --> 00:23:53.748
the conventional side,
the conventional photographic

00:23:53.748 --> 00:24:00.624
technology gained ground on the
speed dimension and a gained a

00:24:00.624 --> 00:24:02.088
lot of it.
 

00:24:02.088 --> 00:24:09.170
Student:  With the
advent of the one-hour photo.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:13.681
Prof: Okay,
so the one photo processing

00:24:13.681 --> 00:24:17.490
took three days,
or five business days,

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:21.200
and brought it down to an
errand.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.750
You drop the film off,
go have a cup of coffee,

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:29.537
come back, so that conventional
photography with no internal

00:24:29.537 --> 00:24:33.558
improvement was closing the
speed gap,

00:24:33.558 --> 00:24:39.078
and diminishing total demand
for instant photography.

00:24:39.078 --> 00:24:46.773
Now there's an incident about
this stage between Polaroid and

00:24:46.773 --> 00:24:47.799
Kodak.
 

00:24:47.799 --> 00:24:49.568
Anybody remember how that goes?
 

00:24:49.568 --> 00:24:57.048
How had--had Kodak played any
part in Polaroid's business?

00:24:57.048 --> 00:25:04.490
Any cooperative part in the
early years?

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:07.118
Student:  It
manufactured the camera.

00:25:07.118 --> 00:25:12.368
Prof: Yeah it--Kodak was
manufacturing for Polaroid.

00:25:12.368 --> 00:25:20.311
As it manufactured it learned
the secret sauce and then went

00:25:20.311 --> 00:25:25.827
into the business,
competing and competing

00:25:25.827 --> 00:25:31.086
effectively against Polaroid
with a tricked up

00:25:31.086 --> 00:25:36.230
reconfiguration of Polaroid's
technology.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.819
Polaroid responded with a
lawsuit.

00:25:40.819 --> 00:25:45.349
They won the lawsuit.
 

00:25:45.349 --> 00:25:47.990
They nonetheless got screwed.
 

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:51.088
How could that be?
 

00:25:51.088 --> 00:25:53.930
They win the--they get a
billion dollars in damages,

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:56.900
or just a little short of a
billion dollars in damages,

00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:04.598
and yet Polaroid's theft is all
but lethal to them.

00:26:04.598 --> 00:26:07.631
Student:  I think it
took them a lot of time and

00:26:07.631 --> 00:26:10.679
effort to fight that case,
and when they finally got the

00:26:10.679 --> 00:26:12.027
reward,
it wasn't as much as they

00:26:12.027 --> 00:26:12.390
expected.
 

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.647
Then there was also this
comment later that they kind of

00:26:15.647 --> 00:26:18.480
wished that Kodak had--
that they had merged with Kodak

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.265
and that didn't happen,
and that is because Kodak did

00:26:21.265 --> 00:26:22.960
not--had too much of an ego.
 

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.460
Prof: Both sides had a
lot of ego.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.410
That's a--you got it.
 

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:32.618
What was needed was an
immediate intervention.

00:26:32.618 --> 00:26:39.080
The case went on almost fifteen
years and while it was going on,

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.925
Kodak was eating into the
competitive position occupied by

00:26:44.925 --> 00:26:46.259
Polaroid.
 

00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:49.626
There's, of course,
something else going on here

00:26:49.626 --> 00:26:52.348
and that's the emergence of
digital.

00:26:52.348 --> 00:26:57.017
Digital photography,
with one important asterisk,

00:26:57.017 --> 00:26:59.058
trumped everything.
 

00:26:59.058 --> 00:27:02.869
It didn't stand still,
it traced a path,

00:27:02.869 --> 00:27:07.756
and it's still on that path of
virtually continuous

00:27:07.756 --> 00:27:09.318
improvement.
 

00:27:09.318 --> 00:27:17.728
A $200 digital camera now is as
good as a $10,000 digital camera

00:27:17.728 --> 00:27:19.730
a decade ago.
 

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:24.819
The--hands up if you use a
digital camera?

00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:27.690
Yeah, everybody.
 

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:33.711
On average my guess is that
your digital cameras are about

00:27:33.711 --> 00:27:34.980
like that?
 

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:38.890
They're tiny,
are they hard to work?

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.288
Do the batteries fail?
 

00:27:42.288 --> 00:27:47.632
There's only one thing they
don't do very well and what's

00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:48.298
that?
 

00:27:48.298 --> 00:27:50.410
Student:  Take pictures
in the dark.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.759
Prof: Well,
they actually do that better

00:27:53.759 --> 00:27:57.693
than conventional cameras,
but no camera does that very

00:27:57.693 --> 00:27:58.348
well.
 

00:27:58.348 --> 00:28:02.611
What's--my mother hates them,
why would a ninety-five year

00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:04.178
old--
Student:  They don't

00:28:04.178 --> 00:28:04.430
print.
 

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.618
Prof: They don't print.
 

00:28:05.618 --> 00:28:09.222
Her idea of a photo is
something you hold in your hands

00:28:09.222 --> 00:28:13.558
and it's not a real photo unless
she can hold it in her hands,

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:16.404
put it on the coffee table,
show it to her friends from the

00:28:16.404 --> 00:28:20.336
coffee table,
and Edwin Land actually agreed

00:28:20.336 --> 00:28:21.490
with that.
 

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:29.171
It was--part of his infatuation
with the original Polaroid idea

00:28:29.171 --> 00:28:35.258
was that you make the picture,
wave it for a minute until it

00:28:35.258 --> 00:28:37.511
dries,
and hand it to the people who

00:28:37.511 --> 00:28:38.509
are in the view.
 

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:46.337
Now we're going to go back to
the case in this informal way in

00:28:46.337 --> 00:28:50.228
just a minute,
but I'm going to talk about

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:54.238
integration here,
because vertical integration is

00:28:54.238 --> 00:28:57.500
a huge part of the Polaroid
story,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:04.028
and it's an important part of
most corporate stories.

00:29:04.028 --> 00:29:11.107
Vertical integration is
the--think of the dimension that

00:29:11.107 --> 00:29:17.798
starts with raw product ore
coming out of a mine,

00:29:17.798 --> 00:29:24.519
sugar cane coming out of a
field, bananas coming out of a

00:29:24.519 --> 00:29:26.200
rain forest.
 

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:32.029
And then there is a progression
toward a manufacturing or

00:29:32.029 --> 00:29:36.090
processing plant,
or perhaps a series of

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:38.588
manufacturing steps.
 

00:29:38.588 --> 00:29:42.684
Then the distribution of the
product to wholesalers,

00:29:42.684 --> 00:29:47.103
and from wholesalers to
retailers, and from retailers to

00:29:47.103 --> 00:29:48.868
the family picnic.
 

00:29:48.868 --> 00:29:55.130
And a full story of vertical
integration looks like this;

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.960
everything is in the corporate
box from beginning to end.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:05.568
The plus of that is obvious.
 

00:30:05.568 --> 00:30:13.016
The trouble you might have with
your suppliers is completely

00:30:13.016 --> 00:30:20.842
eliminated, and the ability to
direct the details of every step

00:30:20.842 --> 00:30:24.250
is seemingly unlimited.
 

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:29.588
The downside--there are at
least two obvious downsides.

00:30:29.588 --> 00:30:33.182
One is a lot of companies are
good at the front end without

00:30:33.182 --> 00:30:34.980
being good at the back end.
 

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.378
If they go from the front end,
from marketing a retail product

00:30:39.378 --> 00:30:43.490
all the way back to the first
steps of its production,

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:49.130
they may well screw up because
it's just not what they do well.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.759
That's one difficulty.
 

00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:55.250
Another difficulty is
governance.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:31:01.121
The management of a vertically
integrated company is a very

00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:04.628
complicated process,
and it tends,

00:31:04.628 --> 00:31:08.440
as with the railroads we saw a
week ago,

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.328
it tends to bloat the
administrative apparatus,

00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:16.369
make it have many dimensions
from top to plant floor,

00:31:16.369 --> 00:31:19.880
and presents serious challenges.
 

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:23.240
Now that's only half the story.
 

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.792
The other half of vertical
integration has to do with

00:31:26.792 --> 00:31:27.338
ideas.
 

00:31:27.338 --> 00:31:32.125
There's a--what I just talked
about has to do with physical

00:31:32.125 --> 00:31:34.190
stuff, material things.
 

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:39.098
There is also an intellectual
track or ideational track,

00:31:39.098 --> 00:31:44.151
which starts with dreams or
ideas drawn on the back of a

00:31:44.151 --> 00:31:47.615
napkin,
and then invokes science and

00:31:47.615 --> 00:31:50.607
engineering,
and design, and a marketing

00:31:50.607 --> 00:31:50.990
plan.
 

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:57.855
It is in effect the brains
behind the lower box and with

00:31:57.855 --> 00:32:03.598
Polaroid you had a fully
integrated company.

00:32:03.598 --> 00:32:05.118
Now they didn't do mines and
fields,

00:32:05.118 --> 00:32:10.664
but you had a high degree of
vertical integration in the

00:32:10.664 --> 00:32:15.353
ideas process,
and almost as high a degree of

00:32:15.353 --> 00:32:19.019
integration in the material
process.

00:32:19.019 --> 00:32:24.710
So you end up there.
 

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:32.490
Now why did this company fail?
 

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:42.769
Let's start with--I've got warm
calls.

00:32:42.769 --> 00:32:49.259
Amed, why do you think the
company failed?

00:32:49.259 --> 00:32:55.205
Student:  They failed
because of the capabilities and

00:32:55.205 --> 00:33:00.848
beliefs of the 1980s that
influenced their strategies.

00:33:00.848 --> 00:33:04.701
They couldn't--they were more
technology driven and not market

00:33:04.701 --> 00:33:07.922
driven, and reasons,
and so forth--because of senior

00:33:07.922 --> 00:33:08.868
management.
 

00:33:08.868 --> 00:33:14.220
Prof: Okay,
who was this Edwin Land guy?

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.269
Student:  A scientist
who--

00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:19.740
Prof: He was scientist.
 

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.259
When does he get his start as
an inventor?

00:33:22.259 --> 00:33:24.329
Does anybody from remember the
case?

00:33:24.329 --> 00:33:25.619
Student:  It didn't say.
 

00:33:25.619 --> 00:33:27.049
Prof: Pardon.
 

00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:28.088
Student:  Harvard.
 

00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:30.928
Prof: Harvard College,
he's an undergraduate,

00:33:30.928 --> 00:33:32.819
and he invents Polaroid
filters;

00:33:32.819 --> 00:33:35.700
clever lad.
 

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:41.648
He gets fixated,
I think, on a certain view of

00:33:41.648 --> 00:33:48.259
how you do wonderful things and
it focuses on long,

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:53.019
costly, time consuming
research.

00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:58.980
Lindsey Jackson,
anything to add to that?

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.759
Student:  About Land?
 

00:34:01.759 --> 00:34:04.170
Prof: About Land or
about the causes of failure.

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:07.506
Student:  Well,
I could just go off of

00:34:07.506 --> 00:34:11.070
Land's--it was genius what he
was able to do.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:16.289
He was so technology driven,
and he was able to create such

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:19.418
a successful company,
and at a certain point he

00:34:19.418 --> 00:34:22.400
didn't have any competition--
or no real competition--

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.050
Prof: No direct
competition.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.594
Student:  And because
this technology was driving and

00:34:26.594 --> 00:34:29.418
proved to be successful,
as the company grew older they

00:34:29.418 --> 00:34:32.460
got fixated onto something that
technology was going--

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.590
result in and drive them,
so they were hesitant change.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.869
Prof: That's terrific.
 

00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:41.818
So we combine an initial
fixation on a very

00:34:41.818 --> 00:34:46.059
intellectualized R&amp;D
process,

00:34:46.059 --> 00:34:52.510
which is very slow and mildly
contemptuous of marketing,

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:58.034
and we combine that with a
wildly successful market product

00:34:58.034 --> 00:35:03.083
which was not designed by
careful analysis of consumer

00:35:03.083 --> 00:35:05.369
indifference curves.
 

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:12.260
It was designed by Edwin Land's
passion for this product.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:15.990
He correctly guessed,
he lucked out,

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:21.641
he correctly guessed that it
would command an enormous

00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:25.052
consumer market,
and sure enough,

00:35:25.052 --> 00:35:26.440
it did.
 

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:32.860
We've got a kind of path
dependent story there.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.860
Ben Chu?
 

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:40.036
Is there anything left to talk
about on this,

00:35:40.036 --> 00:35:41.650
or are we done?
 

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:45.338
Student:  When Polaroid
was developing its newer

00:35:45.338 --> 00:35:48.275
technologies,
it's important to realize that

00:35:48.275 --> 00:35:51.760
it's not that they were stuck in
the Stone Age.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.699
They were trying to
develop--they made forays into

00:35:54.699 --> 00:35:59.007
digital imagery,
but they still were--they were

00:35:59.007 --> 00:36:05.659
still shackled by the idea of
making money with razor blades,

00:36:05.659 --> 00:36:09.824
marketing strategy,
and really making money with

00:36:09.824 --> 00:36:11.510
printing on film.
 

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:13.440
Prof: Absolutely.
 

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.393
There's a wonderful quote
toward the end of the piece you

00:36:15.393 --> 00:36:16.510
guys read, do you remember it?
 

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:24.650
Here it is.
 

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:30.594
They're talking about what a
wonderful and highly marketable

00:36:30.594 --> 00:36:37.291
device the digital camera is,
and the--this is a marketing

00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:42.130
person talking to a senior
executive,

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.929
and the senior executive's
response is,

00:36:44.929 --> 00:36:46.829
"Where's the film?
 

00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:49.289
That's where the money is."
 

00:36:49.289 --> 00:36:52.349
Of course there is no film,
and there is no money in film.

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:54.389
All the money is in the
hardware.

00:36:54.389 --> 00:37:00.007
That was a hard idea for
Polaroid's top management to

00:37:00.007 --> 00:37:05.840
square with the initial model
based on razors and razor

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.030
blades.
 

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:12.760
There's another idea that
appears in--this is one of the

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.719
papers cited at the end of the
case.

00:37:16.719 --> 00:37:19.721
There's another idea there that
may be important and it's called

00:37:19.721 --> 00:37:20.768
bounded rationality.
 

00:37:20.768 --> 00:37:26.199
Hum if bounded rationality is a
familiar concept.

00:37:26.199 --> 00:37:28.800
We should stop and talk about
it.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:33.909
Edwin Land, let's say his IQ
was 290,

00:37:33.909 --> 00:37:38.202
since they divide by age I
think he would have had to be

00:37:38.202 --> 00:37:42.496
about age three when it was
measured for that to be even

00:37:42.496 --> 00:37:47.333
logically possible,
but let's suppose he's the

00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:50.409
smartest guy in the world.
 

00:37:50.409 --> 00:37:56.460
He nonetheless thinks in
bounded rationality.

00:37:56.460 --> 00:38:00.288
What that means is in order to
get started thinking about

00:38:00.288 --> 00:38:03.911
something, you have to
explicitly or implicitly make a

00:38:03.911 --> 00:38:05.619
bunch of assumptions.
 

00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:12.320
Those assumptions are typically
arbitrary.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:17.132
You can't examine every aspect
of every assumption and ever get

00:38:17.132 --> 00:38:19.539
anything done intellectually.
 

00:38:19.539 --> 00:38:22.199
It's a true statement.
 

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:30.949
The task of managing a company
is exceedingly complex.

00:38:30.949 --> 00:38:39.980
Edwin Land and Mack Booth and
the other people--

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:45.909
you have this very messy chart
here that I took down from the

00:38:45.909 --> 00:38:49.657
case--
none of these senior executives

00:38:49.657 --> 00:38:55.289
was ultimately able to think in
a way that was effective,

00:38:55.289 --> 00:38:59.469
because the bounding
assumptions prohibited it.

00:38:59.469 --> 00:39:06.230
What's so hard about this?
 

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:13.380
What would make it hard to run
Polaroid or Ford Motor Company?

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:20.273
What--yes--
Student:  Because the

00:39:20.273 --> 00:39:24.195
assumptions that they--
Polaroid to begin with was

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.579
basically a research driven
company,

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:28.639
and the assumptions that they
were making the benchmark,

00:39:28.639 --> 00:39:31.050
was that Polaroid is a research
driven company,

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.177
which in effect,
was not correct,

00:39:33.177 --> 00:39:35.840
because as the markets were
changing,

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.608
it sapped all flexibility to be
nimble and respond to the

00:39:39.608 --> 00:39:41.090
competition instead.
 

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.210
Prof: Okay, great.
 

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.112
Is there an analogy in what
happened to them in anything

00:39:46.112 --> 00:39:48.949
about the cardiothoracic systems
case?

00:39:48.949 --> 00:39:55.847
What was the--I thought Karen
did a--Sharon did a fabulous job

00:39:55.847 --> 00:39:57.768
of teaching it.
 

00:39:57.768 --> 00:40:04.125
Why was it that the two-artery
strategy for cardiothoracic

00:40:04.125 --> 00:40:07.469
systems had to be abandoned?
 

00:40:07.469 --> 00:40:11.239
Do you remember?
 

00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:13.059
Some of you said it.
 

00:40:13.059 --> 00:40:18.074
Well it is this,
that the companies who were

00:40:18.074 --> 00:40:24.139
making the devices for
non-surgical intervention,

00:40:24.139 --> 00:40:26.340
the stints, and the little
balloons,

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:29.619
and all that stuff were what
kind of companies?

00:40:29.619 --> 00:40:33.387
Huge, well-funded companies,
which were not going to let

00:40:33.387 --> 00:40:37.635
somebody come in and take market
share without developing a new

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:39.760
step of competitive device.
 

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.154
One of the very hard things
about running a big company is

00:40:44.154 --> 00:40:49.012
that you have to be aware of all
the other players out there who

00:40:49.012 --> 00:40:52.789
may be doing something to damage
your market.

00:40:52.789 --> 00:40:57.820
They probably aren't even
trying to damage your market;

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:01.751
they are probably not even
thinking much about you,

00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:06.235
but instead trying to develop
their own boundedly rational

00:41:06.235 --> 00:41:08.280
idea of their company.
 

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:14.860
In this case Polaroid was badly
bitten,

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:22.809
both by one hour film
processing and by digitals,

00:41:22.809 --> 00:41:26.460
and in the case of the one-hour
film processing,

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:31.088
it wasn't even the processors
so much who were in competition

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:39.565
with Polaroid,
but the conventional film

00:41:39.565 --> 00:41:46.159
people, such as Kodak.
 

00:41:46.159 --> 00:41:49.980
Part of the story then is
bounded rationality;

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:54.387
part of it has to do with
drawing the wrong lessons from

00:41:54.387 --> 00:41:55.670
early success.
 

00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:00.722
Part of it has to do with
something totally irrational,

00:42:00.722 --> 00:42:05.119
which was the commitment to a
founder figure.

00:42:05.119 --> 00:42:09.284
Is it generally the case that
brilliant engineers run huge

00:42:09.284 --> 00:42:13.670
companies which produce the
products based on their ideas?

00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.679
It's not generally the case.
 

00:42:17.679 --> 00:42:22.179
I mean, we can all name cases,
but in general,

00:42:22.179 --> 00:42:29.282
the engineers who create
devices are forced out of top

00:42:29.282 --> 00:42:37.460
management and replaced by
people who are general managers.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:43.143
That's what happened at
Polaroid, but it happened too

00:42:43.143 --> 00:42:43.909
late.
 

00:42:43.909 --> 00:42:46.949
It happened much too late.
 

00:42:46.949 --> 00:42:50.500
Now if you were going to save
Polaroid,

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.338
let's say in the 1980s,
let's suppose you are Mack

00:42:55.338 --> 00:43:01.559
Booth and it's your task to give
this company the best chance of

00:43:01.559 --> 00:43:06.300
preserving its value going into
the future,

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.659
what would you do?
 

00:43:07.659 --> 00:43:11.804
What they did do was a hell of
a lot of R&amp;D on a long

00:43:11.804 --> 00:43:14.320
string of projects which failed.
 

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.242
Some of them were artistic or
engineering successes,

00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:21.550
but none of them were economic
successes.

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:27.021
Polar Vision was a disaster,
Helios was actually a really

00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:30.733
good product,
but they didn't manage to

00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:33.469
recoup their investment.
 

00:43:33.469 --> 00:43:37.219
What would you have done?
 

00:43:37.219 --> 00:43:42.550
If your--are you ready?
 

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:48.610
Student:  I'm actually
visiting.

00:43:48.610 --> 00:43:53.039
Prof: I'm going to cold
call you anyway.

00:43:53.039 --> 00:43:58.889
The nice thing is you don't
have anything at risk.

00:43:58.889 --> 00:44:04.300
Well you didn't read the case,
so that's unfair.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.371
Are you--
Student:  I am in the

00:44:08.371 --> 00:44:08.780
class.
 

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:10.518
Prof: Okay, good.
 

00:44:10.518 --> 00:44:12.369
What might you have done to
save this company?

00:44:12.369 --> 00:44:15.210
Student:  I really do
agree with what Booth said.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.554
He said that he would have
probably merged with Fuji and

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.260
kind of use the best aspects of
both,

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:21.849
because Fuji was moving
forward, hopefully digital,

00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:23.989
and they were still kind of
doing instant photography.

00:44:23.989 --> 00:44:26.239
Because one of the things that
they were still,

00:44:26.239 --> 00:44:28.219
I think, fixated upon was
instant photography,

00:44:28.219 --> 00:44:30.369
what the founder founded,
so they were--

00:44:30.369 --> 00:44:33.181
because that kind of cult,
and if they weren't really

00:44:33.181 --> 00:44:36.050
moving on towards other things
and improving on it.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:37.978
Prof: Okay,
so a merger might well have

00:44:37.978 --> 00:44:38.880
been the best play.
 

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.480
Now why would it--what would
make it hard to do?

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.942
Student:  I think it's
the culture of the company that

00:44:45.942 --> 00:44:48.003
they would--
it's the whole ego trip thing,

00:44:48.003 --> 00:44:50.041
they don't really--
kind of like they had to cheat

00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:52.568
and the vertical integration was
part of the reason they were so

00:44:52.568 --> 00:44:53.170
proud of it.
 

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.409
Prof: Oka,y so part of
it is culture.

00:44:55.409 --> 00:44:59.456
I think that debt of theirs
would have weakened their

00:44:59.456 --> 00:45:01.170
bargaining position.
 

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:08.460
Yes.
 

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.940
Student:  Rather than
mergin a company,

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.751
I think that Polaroid could
have done something along the

00:45:12.751 --> 00:45:16.050
lines of what IBM is doing now,
become a completely research

00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.005
based company,
cut out their marketing,

00:45:18.005 --> 00:45:19.530
cut out their consumer
processes,

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:22.690
and just research for Fuji,
research for,

00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.139
conduct new research designs
for other companies who are in

00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:27.389
the consumer field.
 

00:45:27.389 --> 00:45:29.610
So cut down on your vertical
integration.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.465
Prof: Okay,
that might actually--that makes

00:45:32.465 --> 00:45:33.980
a certain kind of sense.
 

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:36.980
Talk a little more and defend
the idea.

00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:39.340
Student:  Because at the
end of the day,

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.213
the whole company culture was
driven towards cutting edge

00:45:42.213 --> 00:45:42.880
research.
 

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.068
A lot of their successful
products were because they were

00:45:46.068 --> 00:45:49.311
able to invent and create
products that were successful on

00:45:49.311 --> 00:45:51.856
lines of,
not success of marketing,

00:45:51.856 --> 00:45:54.510
not successful marketing
strategies,

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:57.983
but they were able to create
products which were ahead of the

00:45:57.983 --> 00:45:59.780
curve in terms of technology.
 

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:02.907
Since the whole market,
the industry was moving towards

00:46:02.907 --> 00:46:06.193
the addition of platform,
perhaps they could become

00:46:06.193 --> 00:46:09.987
leaders of developing these
technologies with the improved

00:46:09.987 --> 00:46:12.250
digital products in the future.
 

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:15.329
Prof: Okay,
that's a very interesting

00:46:15.329 --> 00:46:16.260
suggestion.
 

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:18.190
Yes.
 

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:23.481
Student:  I still think
that the merger wouldn't go well

00:46:23.481 --> 00:46:28.175
because of the vertical
integration that Polaroid had in

00:46:28.175 --> 00:46:29.030
place.
 

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:32.788
They had huge facilities and
machines designed for peak times

00:46:32.788 --> 00:46:33.539
and sales.
 

00:46:33.539 --> 00:46:37.454
And these fixed costs would
have been a big problem for

00:46:37.454 --> 00:46:41.079
Kodak, so I think they wouldn't
merge with them.

00:46:41.079 --> 00:46:46.989
Prof: That might well be.
 

00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:51.456
I mean they might have
liquidated those through private

00:46:51.456 --> 00:46:54.268
equity and kept intact the rest.
 

00:46:54.268 --> 00:46:57.650
Student:  I think they
were specialized on the films of

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:58.260
Polaroid.
 

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.480
Prof: Yeah, okay.
 

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:03.829
Let's turn to Enron now.
 

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:08.550
Enron is another innovation
company.

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:11.769
Jim, can you come up for just a
second?

00:47:11.769 --> 00:47:14.190
I didn't warn him about this.
 

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:18.485
Jim, as I said to those of you
who were here at the beginning

00:47:18.485 --> 00:47:23.672
of shopping period,
Jim was Chief Financial Officer

00:47:23.672 --> 00:47:28.219
of Enron Global Power &amp;
Pipeline,

00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:35.010
and saw the process from the
beginning.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:39.619
He came from a long career in
investment banking before that.

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:45.846
Culture of innovation at Enron,
was it important from day one

00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:50.619
when you were arrived there as a
consultant?

00:47:50.619 --> 00:47:55.581
Jim Alexander:
 Yes, it was a culture of

00:47:55.581 --> 00:48:01.728
innovation that was impressed
upon the organization by Ken

00:48:01.728 --> 00:48:04.775
Lay,
because he was trying to avoid

00:48:04.775 --> 00:48:08.856
the mindset that was typical of
natural gas pipelines at the

00:48:08.856 --> 00:48:11.351
time,
which was very much a monopoly

00:48:11.351 --> 00:48:15.061
rate based rate of return,
it doesn't matter if you make

00:48:15.061 --> 00:48:18.706
any money kind of a mindset,
and he went way overboard in

00:48:18.706 --> 00:48:19.630
reversing that.
 

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:23.610
Prof: Okay,
was Ken Lay a famous manager,

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:27.329
and was Enron receiving prizes,
for example,

00:48:27.329 --> 00:48:29.943
from The Harvard
Business School as the best

00:48:29.943 --> 00:48:31.460
run company in the country?
 

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:34.503
Jim Alexander:
 Yes, I've always thought

00:48:34.503 --> 00:48:36.820
that--
Prof: Jim is a graduate

00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:39.576
of Yale College and HBS,
so we whipsaw him here a

00:48:39.576 --> 00:48:40.150
little.
 

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.465
Jim Alexander:
 One of those things I've

00:48:42.465 --> 00:48:45.585
always thought people ought to
do though is in terms of looking

00:48:45.585 --> 00:48:48.606
at industries in decline is to
look at plaudit's from HBS and

00:48:48.606 --> 00:48:51.929
the percent of graduates from
HBS going to a given industry.

00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:57.150
Prof: Okay,
so the case for Wednesday is

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.782
"Innovation
corrupted,"

00:49:00.782 --> 00:49:04.851
it's an HBS case,
and it was in that packet of

00:49:04.851 --> 00:49:06.650
three which you got a week ago.
 

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.090
Please read it with care.
 

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:14.610
Jim and I will do this
interrogatively;

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:17.048
we'll sit together and talk it
through, and turn to you

00:49:17.048 --> 00:49:19.353
intermittently for help in
solving Enron's dilemmas.

00:49:19.353 --> 00:49:22.108
I'd like to meet briefly with
the graduate students who are in

00:49:22.108 --> 00:49:23.599
this course at the--at now.
 

00:49:23.599 --> 00:49:29.000

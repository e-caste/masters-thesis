00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.400
Today's lecture, if you
look at the online guide,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.800
is supposed to be about
Martin Luther King,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.567
the establishment of
the Southern Christian

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:21.900
Leadership Conference,
as well as the Student

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.800
Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee.&nbsp;

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.100
And I'm going to do my absolute
best to get us to that moment.&nbsp;

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.067
We should be able to do it.&nbsp;
But because of the lost

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:31.200
lecture due to the midterm,
this is sort of my last

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.000
attempt to get us back on
schedule.&nbsp; So I want to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.200
canvass a slightly larger
period.&nbsp; Today I plan on

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.400
discussing some critical
aspects of the Montgomery

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.600
bus boycott and the
integration of Central High

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500
School in Little
Rock, events from '54,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.600
excuse me, '55, '56,'57.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.300
By doing so, it allows me to
talk about a very important

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.300
aspect of the movement that
I've made an allusion to

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.800
already once or
twice in the course,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.600
but you'll certainly see it
coming up again--time and

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.800
again over the next
few weeks of the course,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.067
and that is the issue of
respectability.&nbsp; Just as we

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:11.300
can look at the
late nineteenth

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.867
century's--century
and issues of,

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:17.300
of being civilized, of
having proper sort of normed

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.300
middle class behaviors is
very important to at least

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.300
the black
leadership elite class,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.100
being respectable, being
the right kind of person is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.900
fundamental to understanding
a lot of the civil rights

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.567
struggles.&nbsp; Now let's
look at the Montgomery bus

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:36.067
boycott.&nbsp; And I'm going to
presume that in the history

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:37.900
of the Montgomery
bus boycott and the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.200
desegregation of
Central High School,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.900
this is now American History
101 that you should have had

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.600
the gloss of it when you
were in high school.&nbsp; And

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.100
I'm sure you didn't get
much more than the gloss,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.300
and I'm sure the gloss was
wrong.&nbsp; [students laugh]&nbsp;

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.200
But what I want to do is
actually give you--you know

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.900
the mythic
narrative of these things,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.200
which is there for a reason,
and I want to give you some

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.400
background details that are
important to consider.&nbsp; So

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.667
as far as the
boycott is concerned,

00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:03.700
Montgomery bus boycott,
there's a standard history

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.767
that has become
mythic.&nbsp; Rosa Parks,

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:12.067
the tired seamstress,
refuses to give up the seat,

00:02:12.067 --> 00:02:15.500
her seat, on the bus in
Montgomery and she gets

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.867
arrested.&nbsp; Martin Luther
King comes swooping in to

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:22.000
her rescue and then rises to
the national scene with his

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.500
leadership of the
yearlong boycott,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.900
thirteen-month
boycott, that would,

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.700
that would ensue shortly
thereafter.&nbsp; I was looking

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.800
at the syllabus last night
and realized I dropped a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.300
reading for you.&nbsp; And I want
to encourage you to go back

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.600
and look at it now.&nbsp; I'm
referencing it right now.&nbsp; I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.000
believe it's pages three
fifty-two to three sixty-one

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.200
in the Manning Marable
anthology.&nbsp; It just,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.800
I just, it just slipped
out of the syllabus by

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.967
accident.&nbsp; And
in those pages,

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:48.900
you'll see Jo Ann
Gibson Robinson,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.000
a prominent black
woman in Montgomery,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.167
explain her version of
the events around the bus

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:02.500
boycott.&nbsp; Just even knowing
about Jo Ann Gibson Robinson

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.700
changes the story of the bus
boycott.&nbsp; Robinson was part

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.300
of a cadre of, of
middle-class African

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.600
American women, sort of
think of the club women from

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.700
the early, late-nineteenth
century that I talked about

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.000
a few weeks ago, who had
already organized into a

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.400
force, the Women's Political
Council.&nbsp; These were women

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.500
who were well-educated,
college educated,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.300
some of them teaching at a
local college.&nbsp; These were

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.300
sort of the elite.&nbsp; Although
they didn't nece--they

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.200
weren't rolling in money,
these were the elite in,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.100
in black Montgomery.&nbsp; The
Women's Political Council

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.300
with Jo Ann Gibson
Robinson's leadership,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.267
she's one of the
key figures in it,

00:03:45.267 --> 00:03:50.000
has already gone to the
black ministers in town and

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.200
the city government in town
about their frustration over

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.400
the way that blacks were
treated on the buses and the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.100
way they were treated in
stores downtown.&nbsp; "Economic

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.600
boycott" are the words
they're floating around.&nbsp;

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.800
They wanted to try to
develop the courage in the

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.300
black community to get a
boycott organized.&nbsp; The

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.567
Women's Political Council
keeps running into dead ends

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.700
in various places.&nbsp;
They might get a meeting,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.900
but the meeting,
frankly, where men were in a

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.900
leadership position, would
be rather condescending to

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.200
the women: "That's very
sweet of you to come in,

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.100
but, you know, we'll
take care of things now."&nbsp;

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.400
Nothing would happen.&nbsp;
Now the Women's Political

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.700
Council actually tries to
organize boycotts of the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.667
buses around
issues of crisis,

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:39.267
and this is when other
people get arrested for

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:43.867
refusing to give up their
seat.&nbsp; Now if you look at

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.400
the selection in the Marable
reading and Jo Ann Gibson

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.267
Robinson's recounting of the
bus boycott and Rosa Parks

00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:52.167
arrest, you might find
something striking.&nbsp; When I

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:53.800
was actually going back
and looking at it tonight,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.100
like, "God, how did I forget
to include this?"&nbsp; If you

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.567
scan it, as I
did several times,

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.467
for Martin
Luther King's role,

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.700
you will only see King's
name mentioned once and,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.100
quite literally, in
the second to last line,

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.800
I believe, of this reading.&nbsp;
Now this is an excerpt,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.867
granted.&nbsp; Things might have
been dropped out.&nbsp; But if

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:12.300
nothing else,
metaphorically,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.267
it's actually a very
important point.&nbsp; King was

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:19.267
not there, not engaged
in the organizing moment,

00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:22.767
early organizing
moments of the bus boycott,

00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:27.500
what would turn into the
bus boycott.&nbsp; Now why bother

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.567
telling this story?&nbsp; Just
because it's inserting a new

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:32.167
cast of characters?&nbsp; Well,
maybe that's part of it.&nbsp;

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:33.600
Maybe because it was
pointing to the role that

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.700
women played in
the movement,

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.200
had always played in the
movement.&nbsp; That's certainly

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.900
part of it as well.&nbsp;
But another part of it's

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.200
important to know, is
that the bus boycott was,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.067
its success was incumbent
upon many different

00:05:47.067 --> 00:05:48.900
factors.&nbsp; It wasn't
just King's charisma,

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.600
although we cannot ever
discount King's charisma.&nbsp;

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.467
Part of it was dealing with
an already established and

00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:58.767
organized,
politically organized,

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:01.100
black middle class, as
basically the organizing is

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.300
done through their
women.&nbsp; There's already,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.400
then, a network of
activists in place,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.600
upon which King's
charisma could be displayed,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.600
or through which.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.000
I don't know what the right
descriptor is.&nbsp; It basically

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.067
starts to muddy up the
narrative of the civil

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:20.067
rights movement, this,
this amazing moment of the

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:22.567
movement.&nbsp; But
there's more to the story,

00:06:22.567 --> 00:06:27.000
always more complicating
factors.&nbsp; Rosa Parks was

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.700
arrested, there's
no doubt about that,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.267
but it wasn't as spontaneous
as history makes it out to

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:36.267
be.&nbsp; Now Parks is
refer--referred to as the

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.400
mother of the movement,
partly because of her

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.800
indisputable character.&nbsp; She
was as proper as one could

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.600
imagine.&nbsp; She
was hardworking,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.600
she was civil, she
was law-abiding.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.600
She's the perfect
person to become a "victim,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.000
 of it were, of an insane
system.&nbsp; If you can't treat

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.400
this person
properly, there's something

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.800
fundamentally wrong with
your system.&nbsp; We know that

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.900
about Rosa Parks.&nbsp; But what
we don't know is that she'd

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.700
been trained at a civil
rights institute the summer

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.967
before she decides
to get arrested,

00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:16.567
the Highlander School
in Tennessee.&nbsp; Parks was

00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:18.967
reluctant to go, but she
had friends who were already

00:07:18.967 --> 00:07:21.000
committed to the movement
in very public ways,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.300
convinced her to come
along.&nbsp; And while there,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.300
she's meeting
with white radicals,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.800
labor activists,
Communist Party members,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.000
other black activists
from around the country,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and learning about
nonviolent civil

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
disobedience, learning about
different strategies in

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.967
which to create a crisis
for the sake of the greater

00:07:43.967 --> 00:07:49.500
good.&nbsp; So Rosa Parks, now
she's not a fire-breathing

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.600
radical.&nbsp; She's
not at the vanguard,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.600
but she is trained and she's
prepared for that moment

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.500
when it actually happens.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.800
That's dropped out of the
history.&nbsp; Another thing

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:00.800
that's dropped out
of the history is,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.367
she was not the
first woman--or person,

00:08:03.367 --> 00:08:05.200
but in this case,
woman-- to be arrested for,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.800
you know, violating
etiquette on the buses,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.467
certainly not in Montgomery,
certainly not in other

00:08:12.467 --> 00:08:13.767
places.

00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:16.867
In fact, a few weeks
before Parks was arrested,

00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:19.200
a young woman named
Claudette Colvin was

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.700
arrested in a similar
situation.&nbsp; The boycott

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.067
almost emerged, organized
by the Women's Political

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:27.700
Council, and the boycott
almost emerged revolving

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.100
around Colvin's arrest.&nbsp; She
was a straight-A student;

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.867
she seemed to be of
impeccable character.&nbsp; If

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:35.700
you're treating a
child like this,

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.700
how could you treat any--I
mean how could you claim to

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.900
be humane?&nbsp; It
turns out though,

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:48.567
that very quickly discovered
that they couldn't use her,

00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:52.000
Colvin, as a vehicle
for their boycott,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.700
because this straight-A
student of unimpeachable

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.200
character,
unmarried of course,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.800
also happened to be
pregnant.&nbsp; She was not

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.200
showing at the moment.&nbsp;
People in Montgomery,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.900
black activists, realized
right away there's no case.&nbsp;

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.600
That they, they cannot make
a case around her because of

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.800
Southern traditions that
would say that she was

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.100
immoral for her, quote,
"condition."&nbsp; And that would

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.600
have been the word that
would have been used.&nbsp; And

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.100
they knew that they could
not make a convincing case

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:26.000
if they have someone
with such failed standards,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.300
such immorality
in her system,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.400
that she'd be the worst
example for these women

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.200
activists.&nbsp; The activists
understood that being

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.867
respectable in a very narrow
band of what that means was

00:09:39.867 --> 00:09:43.967
absolutely critical.&nbsp;
Respectability is so

00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:48.200
important to the movement,
because anything that

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.600
transgressed a line of being
respectable could be used to

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.700
justify a
denial of some sort,

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.400
whether it's legal, "You
can't come to this school,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.800
 whether it's
psychological, "I can,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.400
I can limit your entire
existence in terms of

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.300
possibilities," or
whether it's physical,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.267
"I can kill you."&nbsp; Let's
just go back to Brown v.

00:10:09.267 --> 00:10:12.700
Board and the reactions
to it.&nbsp; I already told you

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.067
about Melba Beals'
experience as she's about to

00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:17.300
be raped when she's
twelve years old,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.967
but we can see in reactions
in other places in the

00:10:22.967 --> 00:10:28.700
South, systemic reactions,
the extent or the ways in

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.567
which there was a logic that
blacks had to behave just

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:36.867
right because the stakes
were so high.&nbsp; In the wake

00:10:36.867 --> 00:10:38.200
of Brown v.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:43.300
Board, in July of '54, the
White Citizens Council is

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.167
formed.&nbsp; I'm
simplifying a lot,

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:49.700
but think of it as the
upper-crust Ku Klux Klan.&nbsp;

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.100
Business
leaders, white males,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.000
prominent figures in
these Southern towns that

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.867
organized, Southern cities,
organized themselves,

00:10:56.867 --> 00:11:00.867
fund Klan activities, making
sure in a variety of ways

00:11:00.867 --> 00:11:02.900
that there would not be an
integration or destruction

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:08.500
of their social order.&nbsp;
Economic warfare happens

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.400
across the South
with, with city leaders,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.900
White Coun--White Citizens
Councils battling it out

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.800
with radicals, the
most proper radicals,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:23.000
like Jo--Jo Ann Gibson
Robinson.&nbsp; Governments start

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.400
responding.&nbsp; This
arcane little caveat in,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:35.000
in--excuse me, loss of words
here--in how governments

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.800
interact, the Doctrine of
Interposition.&nbsp; It's a weird

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.367
phrase.&nbsp; The Doctrine of
Interposition is invoked by

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:43.400
Southerners, saying that the
federal government had no

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.267
power to interfere in
states.&nbsp; This goes back to

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:48.867
1832 or something like
that.&nbsp; Completely ignored

00:11:48.867 --> 00:11:52.900
little tidbit attached
on some bill somewhere.&nbsp;

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:57.300
Southern governors and
governments start invoking

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.100
the Doctrine of
Interposition,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:04.167
saying the federal
government had no power to

00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:07.600
interfere, interfere in
states.&nbsp; Federal officials

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.967
from the South, members of
the House of Representatives

00:12:09.967 --> 00:12:12.800
and Senate, gather together
and all through the Southern

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:17.300
Manifesto, saying that
Brown was a clear abuse of

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:20.500
judicial power.&nbsp; Only
one member from a federal

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.900
delegation in the South
refused to participate,

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.000
and that's Al Gore, Sr.
from Tennessee.&nbsp; Wait,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.867
I might be blanking on
that.&nbsp; I think--Kefauver.

00:12:28.867 --> 00:12:29.867
Kefauver, yeah, thank you.

00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:32.767
and Lyndon
Johnson.&nbsp; Was it three?

00:12:32.767 --> 00:12:33.800
It was three.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.167
Well, there you go, it was
three.&nbsp; Well done.&nbsp; Where'd

00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:40.600
you learn this history?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did you take this class last

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.600
year?

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.000
No, I just wrote a
paper on postwar America.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.067
Excellent.&nbsp; Well done.

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:47.600
You were trained by
somebody well.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.700
but thank you.&nbsp; There
was--All but three of I

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.867
think maybe a
hundred people.

00:12:52.867 --> 00:12:54.700
No, there were
representatives who didn't

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.700
do it, including Rayburn.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.167
Oh, well hell, apparently I
don't know the history at

00:12:57.167 --> 00:12:58.167
all.

00:12:58.167 --> 00:13:00.600
There were other
representatives.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.667
This is why it's so
dangerous to talk to

00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:06.567
students at Yale.&nbsp; The fact
is massive--the Southern

00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:11.500
Manifesto is a declaration
that Brown doesn't carry

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.100
weight.&nbsp; There's going to
be a negative response of,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.200
of, of resistance, and
the phrase becomes known as

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.100
"massive resistance"; that
the South is going to refuse

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.200
to proceed forward with the
logic coming down from the

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:33.200
Supreme Court.&nbsp; People start
becoming targeted.&nbsp; NAACP as

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.200
an organization
becomes targeted by Southern

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.667
legislatures, saying the
NAACP had to reveal its

00:13:42.667 --> 00:13:46.567
membership list in order
to stay in business as a,

00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:50.000
as a, an organization, had
to reveal who was in its

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.300
membership.&nbsp; This is
basically a death warrant to

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.300
the organization
in some states,

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.900
and to people who were, and
to people who were members.&nbsp;

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.867
If you were known to be a
member of the NAACP and

00:13:59.867 --> 00:14:02.400
worked in
Mississippi, well, you know,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.600
the boss might decide you
don't have your job any

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.100
longer, for some other
trumped up reason.&nbsp; And it

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.700
might actually get you
killed.&nbsp; Violence takes on

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.700
gothic proportions in
Mississippi more than any

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.900
other place.&nbsp; In '55,
several black leaders urging

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.300
blacks to vote
were murdered,

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.700
one on the local
courthouse lawn.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.300
The president of a local
NAACP chapter was shot down

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.400
when he ignored the order
to remove his name from the

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:30.667
voting register.&nbsp;And then
of course there was Emmett

00:14:30.667 --> 00:14:36.167
Till, fourteen-year-old,
fourteen-year-old boy,

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:37.700
sent from Chicago to
stay with his family in

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.400
Mississippi.&nbsp; There are many
different versions of what

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.500
happens.&nbsp; The allegation is
that he whistled one day,

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.500
hanging out
with his cousins,

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.800
that he whistled at the--a
white storekeeper's wife

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.900
when she walked past.&nbsp;
Others have countered saying

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.900
he had a, he had
a stutter, and,

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.100
you know, he would often
lisp as a result.&nbsp; What

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:03.700
actually happened at
that moment is really

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.067
inconsequential.&nbsp; What
happens later is of great

00:15:07.067 --> 00:15:11.100
consequence.&nbsp; That
night he's abducted.&nbsp; He's

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.800
beaten.&nbsp; One of his eyes is
gouged out.&nbsp; He's wrapped in

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.400
barbed wire and tied to
farm equipment before being

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.067
thrown over a
bridge.&nbsp; When they find him,

00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:27.800
his body is sent
surreptitiously up to

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.300
Chicago.&nbsp; His mother insists
on having an open casket at

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.800
the Chicago funeral and the
images shock the country.&nbsp;

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:41.800
There's a clip here, that
opens up with Mose Wright,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.900
who was Emmett Till's uncle,
who makes a very famous

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.200
declaration going into
court.&nbsp; And he points out

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.067
the people who came to
get Emmett Till from him,

00:15:57.067 --> 00:15:59.300
which meant he could no
longer live in Mississippi.&nbsp;

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.800
He vacated right away in
order that he might live to

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.867
see another day.

00:16:02.867 --> 00:16:10.167
When the sheriff came and
told me they had found a

00:16:10.167 --> 00:16:14.400
body at [the Tallahatchie
River near Glendora,

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.167
Mississippi], and wanted me
to go and identify the body,

00:16:18.167 --> 00:16:19.767
which I did.

00:16:19.767 --> 00:16:25.767
And we found the body,
which it didn't have on any

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.367
clothes at all.

00:16:43.367 --> 00:16:50.000
The body was so badly
damaged that we couldn't

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
hardly just tell who he was,
but he happened to have on a

00:16:59.567 --> 00:17:06.200
ring with his initials,
and that cleared it up.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:13.567
The body was shipped home,
back north to Chicago where

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:20.200
Mamie Till Bradley insisted
on an open casket funeral,

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:26.100
"So all the world
can see," she said,

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:30.500
"what they did to my boy."

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.200
Jet magazine
showed Till's corpse,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.600
beaten, mutilated,
shot through the head.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:46.000
A generation of black people
would remember the horror of

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.500
that photo.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:54.100
I believe that the whole
United States is mourning

00:17:54.100 --> 00:18:00.100
with me, and that the death
of my son can mean something

00:18:02.967 --> 00:18:09.600
to the other unfortunate
people all over the world.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:15.600
Then for him to have died a
hero would mean more to me

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.300
than for him
just to have died.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.967
When you heard the
narrator, Julian Bond,

00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:32.500
talking about a generation
would never forget this

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.300
murder and the image that
appeared in Jetmagazine,

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.800
he wasn't exaggerating.&nbsp;
One of my former colleagues,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.900
her father's family
from, was from Louisiana,

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.800
from a rural
part of Louisiana,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:50.700
and I was--he was visiting.&nbsp;
We were having lunch

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.800
together, dinner together,
and Emmett Till came up.&nbsp; I

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.200
can't remember why.&nbsp; But
he said he was fourteen or

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.467
fifteen years old when
Emmett Till was murdered,

00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:04.400
and he knew then that he had
to leave the South as soon

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.700
as he could, and in fact,
he never went back.&nbsp; And he

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.900
said he has never forgotten,
and he knew there was no

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.000
hope for, as he put it,
"a black man in the Deep

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.200
South."&nbsp; Now there
was a court case.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.900
It was an all white,
all male jury.&nbsp; The jury

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.000
deliberates for sixty-seven
minutes.&nbsp; One juror said

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.700
later, it wouldn't have
taken so long if they hadn't

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.100
stopped to get a soda.&nbsp; And
the jury defines--finds the

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.600
defendants not guilty,
although everybody knew who

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:41.267
did it.&nbsp; January '56, one
month after Parks' arrest in

00:19:41.267 --> 00:19:44.600
Montgomery, Look magazine
publishes an interview of

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.100
the Till defendants in which
they state for the record

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.900
that they had in fact killed
him.&nbsp; Now this is the most

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:55.000
spectacular and perhaps
egregious case of violence

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.100
gone unpunished, but
there were other episodes,

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.167
and some of them happened as
a direct result of Brown.&nbsp; I

00:20:00.167 --> 00:20:02.067
already again
related to you,

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:04.067
the attempted
rape of Melba Beals,

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.700
but violence is endemic.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.200
In fact, this is one of
the great stories of the

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.300
nonviolent civil
rights movement,

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.200
is that it was horribly
violent and it's rather

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.400
shocking that it did not
become more violent at any

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.800
given moment.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:21.800
Now thinking of violence
and respectability and

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.100
narratives of the civil
rights movement leads us to

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:25.100
the Little Rock Nine.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.367
And I have to gloss over the
history very quickly for the

00:20:28.367 --> 00:20:34.700
sake of time.&nbsp; Melba Beals
goes on--the person who was

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.100
twelve years old when
someone loses his mind and

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.867
tries to attack her--goes on
to come--become one of nine

00:20:39.867 --> 00:20:44.100
teenagers who are eventually
selected by NAACP activists

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.800
to integrate Little Rock
Central High School.&nbsp; They

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.000
are focusing on Arkansas
because it seemed to be one

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.900
of the most progressive
states in the South on these

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.800
issues.&nbsp; Other parts--other
school systems in Arkansas

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.800
had actually
already integrated,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:01.000
but Central was
the most important,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.767
most visible high school
in the state.&nbsp; The nine who

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:11.200
were selected were
amazing students,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.667
academically gifted, coming
from the right families who

00:21:14.667 --> 00:21:18.100
comported themselves in the
right way.&nbsp; Otherwise they

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.900
would never have been
selected.&nbsp; Without going

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.300
over too much of the famous
integration of Central High,

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.067
I'll point out a
few things that are,

00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:29.400
that one needs to remember.&nbsp;
The students are selected to

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.500
integrate in '57.&nbsp; There's
fierce local resistance.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:35.767
The governor, Orval Faubus,
calls in the Arkansas

00:21:35.767 --> 00:21:37.467
National Guard to
prevent integration.

00:21:37.467 --> 00:21:41.067
President Eisenhower,
very unhappy about the whole

00:21:41.067 --> 00:21:46.000
scene, sends in the 101st
Airborne to force the issue,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.867
and he does it not because
he believed in integration,

00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:49.367
but because he believed in
the federal government's

00:21:49.367 --> 00:21:51.767
right to assert itself.&nbsp;
This is a states' rights

00:21:51.767 --> 00:21:56.467
versus federal rights issue
for Eisenhower.&nbsp; The troops

00:21:56.467 --> 00:21:59.900
ushered in the students
after they had already tried

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.000
to integrate the
school before,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.500
but were harassed by mobs
outside of the building.&nbsp;

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:09.767
The students--the, the
troops could go with the

00:22:09.767 --> 00:22:13.100
students up to the, the
door of the classroom,

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.500
but in the classroom,
or in the bathroom,

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:18.067
or in the cafeteria, all
hell broke loose.&nbsp; One

00:22:18.067 --> 00:22:21.200
student had lye
thrown in her face,

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.967
almost permanently blinded.&nbsp;
Students would talk like

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:26.700
being in the bathroom, and
then going to the bathroom,

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.500
and then paper towels lit on
fire being thrown overhead

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.100
when they were helpless.&nbsp;
They were attacked,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.900
books were thrown
down, food poured on them,

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.400
but they could not respond.&nbsp;
The one student who did

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.400
respond got kicked out,
at which point they said,

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.400
"One nigger down;
eight more to go,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.500
 trying to get these
students out of the school.&nbsp;

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.567
Houses were bombed,
people were shot--shot at,

00:22:58.567 --> 00:23:04.200
folks lost their jobs.&nbsp; Now
think about all this.&nbsp; What

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.100
is it that's being
asked of these children?

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:12.400
And they are children.&nbsp;
Going back to Melba Beals,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.100
there's a few items
from her diary entry,

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.800
New Year's Day in 1958, that
allow us to ask some pretty

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.067
important questions.&nbsp;
Four different items,

00:23:23.067 --> 00:23:24.800
selected from a
longer list is,

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.967
one, "to behave in a way
that pleases Mother and

00:23:26.967 --> 00:23:29.000
Grandma," two people who
were very central in her

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.067
life.&nbsp; "To keep faith
and understand more of how

00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:35.700
Gandhi behaved when his
life was really hard."

00:23:38.167 --> 00:23:39.967
"To pray daily for the
strength not to fight

00:23:39.967 --> 00:23:44.700
back."&nbsp; And the entry that,
the resolution that she,

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.900
that she put as number one,
was to "do my best to stay

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:54.367
alive until May 29th,"
the end of the school year.

00:23:54.367 --> 00:23:58.567
I mean, think about
it: NAACP activists,

00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:03.800
grown women and men, are
making sure the children

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.300
stay--are to stay in school,
despite the violence being

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.200
vet--being visited upon
them.&nbsp; And it's very fair to

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.500
ask, is it appropriate for
sixteen-year-olds to feel

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.300
the need to write in
their diaries that the most

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.167
important New Year's
resolution is to "do my best

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:26.600
to stay alive" until the end
of the school year?&nbsp;&nbsp; What

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.200
are the adults asking the
children to do for the sake

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:33.467
of the movement?&nbsp; It's a
case--it's a question that

00:24:33.467 --> 00:24:37.867
would come up quite angrily
in 1963 in the Birmingham

00:24:37.867 --> 00:24:42.200
crisis.&nbsp; Now one final note
about the school year and

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.867
Little Rock.&nbsp; What we
don't often hear about,

00:24:45.867 --> 00:24:48.100
what we basically never hear
about Central High School

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.367
history, is that
the govern--I mean,

00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:52.367
because it's a
triumphant moment,

00:24:52.367 --> 00:24:55.867
right?&nbsp; So the governor was
so upset about the public

00:24:55.867 --> 00:24:57.567
relations disaster that
accompanied the school's

00:24:57.567 --> 00:25:00.800
integration, that he decided
to shut down Little Rock

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.500
public schools
the following year.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.567
The integration
of the school,

00:25:06.567 --> 00:25:10.400
this great moment of civil
rights victory of American

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.067
exceptionalism,
lasted one year,

00:25:13.067 --> 00:25:18.800
and the public schools were
shut down.&nbsp; Why don't we

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:22.767
know this part of the
history?&nbsp; You know,

00:25:22.767 --> 00:25:25.900
there's something really
maybe too tantalizing about

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.000
these nice narratives of our
past.&nbsp; We can be ashamed of

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.100
the shortcomings of
our predecessors,

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:34.100
but by keeping the
story clean and simple,

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.100
we can also be proud that
our predecessors ultimately

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:39.600
made the right decision
and did the right things.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.300
In short, the civil rights
movement has been sanitized,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.000
because it ultimately
casts a great light on the

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.100
American
character; that, you know,

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.567
the American character
can take its lumps,

00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:56.767
learn from its mistakes and
then do great things.&nbsp; The

00:25:56.767 --> 00:25:58.900
civil rights movement has
been cast as a great moment

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.967
of American exceptionalism
when we all summoned the

00:26:01.967 --> 00:26:03.200
courage to do
the right things,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.000
regardless of our
political positions,

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.300
where we are in the
country, et cetera.&nbsp; Well,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.467
that's just one big fat
lie.&nbsp; Only a minority of

00:26:11.467 --> 00:26:15.900
folks rose to the
challenge, and accepted it,

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:20.000
and pursued it.&nbsp; Martin
Luther--Martin Luther King's

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.700
history is a case in
point as far as rising to a

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.267
challenge, and as far as
what happens when a history

00:26:27.267 --> 00:26:34.267
is sanitized profoundly.&nbsp;
King is raised in a

00:26:34.267 --> 00:26:38.467
tradition of ministers.&nbsp; His
father and grandfather run

00:26:38.467 --> 00:26:45.567
the most elite black church
in Atlanta.&nbsp; King has a

00:26:45.567 --> 00:26:50.200
rather raucous adolescence
and college years.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.100
He and his buddy go around
trying to run competitions

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.467
about, you know, who could
"deflower the most girls" in

00:26:57.467 --> 00:27:01.100
the language of the
day.&nbsp; He does receive a

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.200
religious--religious
calling,

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:05.300
however, goes off to
seminary and then gets a Ph.

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.300
D.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.467
at Boston University, a Ph.

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:08.467
D.

00:27:08.467 --> 00:27:09.700
which scholars discovered,
much to their great

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.000
disappointment,
about two decades ago,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.400
that he had plagiarized
parts of it.&nbsp; King,

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:21.467
though, these things aren't
widely known at this moment

00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:26.200
in time, '55, is seen
as a real future star,

00:27:28.467 --> 00:27:30.800
and he gets a
job in Montgomery,

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.000
heading the Dexter
Avenue Baptist Church,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.900
which is, much in the
tradition of his father and

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.467
grandfather, the most elite,
sort of upstanding and

00:27:41.467 --> 00:27:45.567
politically conservative,
quiescent church,

00:27:45.567 --> 00:27:49.300
in that particular
city.&nbsp; He's relatively newly

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:55.500
married.&nbsp; He and his wife
Coretta have a newborn.&nbsp; He

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.467
wants to settle into a nice,
quiet pulpit and do nice,

00:27:58.467 --> 00:28:02.867
quiet work.&nbsp; Well, there's
already things shifting

00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:04.500
around on the ground,
with the Women's Political

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.500
Council agitating for
an economic boycott,

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.200
trying to find a test case
to boycott the buses.&nbsp; And

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.200
the group of black ministers
in town are very important

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.900
people, and a group called
the Interdenominational

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.467
Ministerial Alliance.&nbsp; A
ton of syllables there.&nbsp; The

00:28:18.467 --> 00:28:20.400
Interdenominational
Ministerial Alliance is

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.200
feeling pressure from
Women's Political Council to

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:26.167
do something.&nbsp; King as a
minister is automatically in

00:28:26.167 --> 00:28:30.900
that group.&nbsp; And then as
things start heating up

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.400
towards what will
become Rosa Parks's moment,

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.500
King is thrust into the
limelight in a way he never

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:45.700
wanted.&nbsp; Parks gets
arrested.&nbsp; King is sent as

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.100
an emissary or sacrificial
lamb--really more of the

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.800
latter.&nbsp; The Montgomery
Improvement Association is

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:53.800
formed.&nbsp; This is going to
be the group that's going to

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.900
organize the boycotts.&nbsp; King
does not want to lead it.&nbsp;

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.200
The other ministers, who are
deeply skeptical this thing

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.567
will actually work, figure,
"King just got here.&nbsp; He's

00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:07.400
young; he'll rebound when
this thing blows apart.&nbsp;

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.100
We'll put him out front."&nbsp;
King couldn't say no.&nbsp; He

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.300
fought, fought, fought, but
he couldn't say no.&nbsp; He'd

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:17.267
already resisted the
invitation to head the local

00:29:17.267 --> 00:29:19.267
NAACP for the sake
of his children's,

00:29:19.267 --> 00:29:24.200
his child's safety.&nbsp;
Anyway, on December 5th,

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.900
the night before the
boycott's set to begin,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:30.900
King is still resisting
the urging of the ministers,

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.800
and finally relents, and
writes out some notes on a

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.800
piece of paper.&nbsp; Goes to
the pulpit with about ten,

00:29:41.267 --> 00:29:43.700
fifteen minutes to
prepare and says,

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.967
in part, the following.&nbsp;
Now the audio is,

00:29:45.967 --> 00:29:48.000
is not great, and I'll
tell you what he says,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.700
but I want you to hear the
energy of the moment during

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:55.867
the closing moments of his,
of his speech.And we are not

00:29:55.867 --> 00:30:03.200
wrong; we are not wrong
in what we are doing.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:09.200
If we are wrong, the Supreme
Court of this nation is

00:30:11.267 --> 00:30:12.267
wrong.

00:30:12.267 --> 00:30:18.600
If we are wrong, the
Constitution of the United

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.800
States is wrong.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:26.700
If we are wrong, God
Almighty is wrong.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:34.000
If we are wrong, Jesus
of Nazareth was merely a

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.900
utopian dreamer that
never came down to Earth.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:45.800
If we are wrong,
justice is a lie,

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.700
love has no meaning.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:56.067
And we are determined here
in Montgomery to work and

00:30:56.067 --> 00:31:01.200
fight until justice
runs down like water,

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:05.600
and righteousness
like a mighty stream.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.067
Oops!

00:31:07.067 --> 00:31:08.500
"If we are
wrong," he says-- "And,

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.200
and we are not wrong in what
we are doing.&nbsp; We are not

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.300
wrong.&nbsp; If we are wrong, the
Supreme Court of this nation

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.067
is wrong.

00:31:15.067 --> 00:31:17.700
If we are wrong, the
Constitution of the United

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.200
States is wrong.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.200
If we are wrong, God
Almighty is wrong.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.300
If we are wrong,
Jesus of Nazareth is,

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.400
was mer--merely a utopian
dreamer that never came down

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.300
to Earth.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:33.900
If we are wrong,
justice is a lie,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:36.167
love has no meaning.

00:31:36.167 --> 00:31:39.700
And we are determined here
in Montgomery to work and

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:42.267
fight until justice
runs down like water,

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:43.800
and righteousness
like a mighty stream."

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:50.167
You can tell, the
audience is going crazy,

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:52.467
energized by this young man
who's come out of nowhere.

00:31:54.567 --> 00:31:57.400
But think about what he's
saying here.&nbsp; He invokes God

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.600
and Jesus.&nbsp; It's what, what
one would expect of course,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.467
but he invokes in the
first part of this quote the

00:32:02.467 --> 00:32:07.900
Supreme Court and the
Constitution.&nbsp; He's evoking

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:14.667
law.&nbsp; King is not
invoking anything radical,

00:32:14.667 --> 00:32:17.500
as a matter of fact.&nbsp; He's
invoking the Supreme Court

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.400
and the Constitution.&nbsp; He's
invoking those very things

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.100
that made citizens citizens
in the United States after

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.300
all, and perhaps that is
the thing that made him so

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:32.400
radical.&nbsp; Anyway, the
movement takes off and the

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:33.700
boycott holds
together.&nbsp; It's a,

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.367
it's a remarkable history,
although it wasn't the first

00:32:36.367 --> 00:32:38.200
boycott, bus boycott.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.100
The movement holds together
for thirteen months before

00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:43.200
the Supreme Court forces
the integration of the,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:45.100
of the buses.&nbsp; These are the
same thirteen months when

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.600
massive resistance is rising
up throughout the South,

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.600
the same thirteen
months when Emmett Till is

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.000
murdered, and the same
thirteen months when the

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.900
strategy for Little Rock
becomes articulated and

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:02.967
starts to gain traction.&nbsp;
A period of astonishing

00:33:02.967 --> 00:33:05.400
change.&nbsp;Now King
rises to prominence.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.067
He's traveling all around
the country constantly

00:33:07.067 --> 00:33:10.600
raising money during the
bus boycott.&nbsp; They need

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.667
resources and money to pay
for gasoline and cars that

00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:16.200
are all shipped down to
Montgomery to make this

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.667
thing work.&nbsp; But he's not
doing it by himself.&nbsp; He's

00:33:19.667 --> 00:33:23.567
aided by two people who are
rather important.&nbsp; One is

00:33:23.567 --> 00:33:29.267
Bayard Rustin, who I've
already mentioned before.&nbsp;

00:33:29.267 --> 00:33:30.800
Earlier part in his
life, member of the Young

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.000
Communist League,
a draft resistor,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.400
someone who was arrested
on morals charges for being

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.667
caught in the back seat
of a car with another man.

00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:45.400
He's gay.&nbsp; Often recognized
as one of the great

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:49.500
organizing minds of the
freedom struggles and labor

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.900
struggles of the
twentieth century,

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.200
but because of the
politics of the day,

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.600
hampered by his
sexuality and,

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.067
and by his Communist past.&nbsp;
But Bayard Rustin is in

00:34:00.067 --> 00:34:01.500
King's corner, you
know, telling him,

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.500
"Do this, do
that.&nbsp; You know,

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:06.067
follow this particular
path."&nbsp; King is also aided

00:34:06.067 --> 00:34:08.500
by Ella Baker.&nbsp;
And by the way,

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.267
Rustin and Baker are finally
getting the attention that

00:34:10.267 --> 00:34:13.000
they deserve from, from
amazing histories that have

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.600
been written about five or
six years ago.&nbsp; Ella Baker,

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.567
a long-time activist who
worked for Unemployment

00:34:19.567 --> 00:34:22.267
Councils in the
Great Depression.

00:34:22.267 --> 00:34:24.967
Certainly was affiliating
with folks who were

00:34:24.967 --> 00:34:31.367
Communist.&nbsp; Older woman who
becomes hailed by a younger

00:34:31.367 --> 00:34:33.467
generation of activists
who are just about to become

00:34:33.467 --> 00:34:37.900
known for being one of the
most important leaders in

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.900
the movement.&nbsp; Baker
starts to work with King and

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.900
advising him as well.&nbsp;
I'll come back to them in a

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.067
moment.&nbsp; As the
boycott nears success,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.667
we see violence quite
clearly.&nbsp; King's house is

00:34:55.667 --> 00:35:01.100
bombed.&nbsp; Other people
are being shot at.&nbsp; It's a

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.167
bloody mess.&nbsp; But Rustin
sees in the success and the

00:35:05.167 --> 00:35:09.300
violence as a catalytic,
catalytic moment of

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:13.400
possibility, and that the
question becomes not so

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.300
much, "How great
was this moment?"

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.967
but, "What can we do to
capitalize upon it?&nbsp; What

00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:21.967
can we do to sustain this
organizing energy?&nbsp; There

00:35:21.967 --> 00:35:23.067
needs to be an
organization."

00:35:23.067 --> 00:35:27.067
&nbsp;And he calls on King
to bring together other

00:35:27.067 --> 00:35:28.600
leaders, and, and
essentially religious

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.700
leaders, to gather together
to think of the next steps.&nbsp;

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.367
And out of that comes
the Southern Leadership

00:35:34.367 --> 00:35:37.500
Conference, is what the plan
is at least.&nbsp; The Southern

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:40.167
Leadership Conference,
bringing together,

00:35:40.167 --> 00:35:43.400
you know, the great
leaders in the South,

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:51.000
African American, to become
organized to have sustained

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.800
change.&nbsp; Well, King makes
a decision that infuriates

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.400
Rustin, and they have a
very tense relationship in

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:07.867
general, Rustin recognizing
King's astonishing gifts as

00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:10.967
a speaker and King
recognizing Rustin's

00:36:10.967 --> 00:36:12.700
astonishing gifts as an
organizer and political

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:17.367
thinker.&nbsp; King never likes
the fact that Rustin is gay

00:36:17.367 --> 00:36:22.300
and talks condescendingly
to Rustin about it.&nbsp; Rustin

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.100
always underestimates,
in King's opinion,

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.267
the role of religion in this
movement.&nbsp; So Rustin calls

00:36:27.267 --> 00:36:29.067
it the Southern
Leadership Conference,

00:36:29.067 --> 00:36:30.800
and King changes
its name under,

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.000
with sort of fiat, to
the Southern Christian

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.500
Leadership Conference.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.300
And the SCLC, the Southern
Christian Leadership

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.500
Conference, becomes one of
the most important civil

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.100
rights
organizations for the next,

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:49.400
really for the next twenty,
thirty years.&nbsp; King's

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.567
popularity skyrockets
with the success of the bus

00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:54.300
boycott.&nbsp; He's increasingly
drawn away from the pulpit

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.700
as he travels about trying
to raise consciousness and

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.900
funds.&nbsp; And by
January of 1960,

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.067
having barely been in the
pulpit at Dexter over the

00:37:03.067 --> 00:37:06.200
previous few years,
he leaves.&nbsp; He's not

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.800
ministering to that church.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.800
The SCLC, what he now
heads--[student sneezes and

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:15.800
he coughs] excuse me,
bless you--the SCLC is now

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.467
focusing on leadership
training and citizenship

00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:25.467
education.&nbsp; Now as the
SC--SCLC emerges out of

00:37:28.667 --> 00:37:32.100
King's success,
wrapped up in his charisma,

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:36.567
it creates stress in the,
in "the system."&nbsp; You see

00:37:36.567 --> 00:37:40.067
stress often embodied in
intergroup squabbling,

00:37:40.067 --> 00:37:43.400
something you'll see a lot
throughout the 1960s.&nbsp; An

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:47.000
established organization
like the NAACP is not too

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.800
thrilled about the SCLC
arriving on the scene,

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.167
because they're competing
for the same people and the

00:37:51.167 --> 00:37:55.200
same dollars, scant
dollars.&nbsp; In fact,

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:57.300
Medgar Evers, who's the head
of the Mississippi NAACP,

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:03.467
who joins the
SCLC, this new group,

00:38:03.467 --> 00:38:07.300
was told he had to choose.&nbsp;
You either pick with SCLC or

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.500
you pick the NAACP.&nbsp; He
stays with the NAACP.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.900
Now the NAACP is already
under stress.&nbsp; I talked

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.167
about the fact that its
rolls are being opened up by

00:38:17.167 --> 00:38:20.300
Southern legislatures,
but there's also stress

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.300
internally through
people like Robert Williams,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.400
military vet from
North Carolina,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.300
who becomes fed up with
events in his town where

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.767
he's the head of the
local NAACP chapter,

00:38:31.767 --> 00:38:34.500
and calls for retaliatory
violence.&nbsp; He's kicked out

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:41.600
of the NAACP by the end of
the 1950s.&nbsp; So the NAACP is

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:45.200
struggling with
rising, percolating spots of

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.667
militancy,
people leaving the,

00:38:47.667 --> 00:38:51.167
leaving, leaving the
message behind at the NAACP.

00:38:51.167 --> 00:38:53.400
And now this new group
appears on the scene that

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:59.400
might pull away other
supporters.&nbsp; The important

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.667
thing to know I
guess from that,

00:39:02.667 --> 00:39:06.200
I suppose, is that neither
the SCLC nor the NAACP had

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.500
control over the movement.&nbsp;
No single organization could

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:12.000
claim they were the
group that was running the

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.767
movement.

00:39:13.767 --> 00:39:17.367
And while King is the most
electrifying speaker of this

00:39:17.367 --> 00:39:24.367
great narrative, he hardly
had any control over it.&nbsp; If

00:39:24.367 --> 00:39:27.167
you look to the events
of February 1st of 1960,

00:39:27.167 --> 00:39:30.300
you can see the way in which
there was a sort of wildcat

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.700
mentality about many things
happening in the movement.&nbsp;

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:36.800
On that day, in
Greensboro, North Carolina,

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.800
four men, students of
North Carolina A&amp;T,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.600
black school, head to
downtown Greensboro,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.200
not far away.&nbsp; They decide
that they're going to--sick

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.700
and tired of the treatment
they're receiving at the

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:54.300
Woolworth's, the
local five and dime,

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.800
let me think, drugstore,
convenience store.&nbsp; It's

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.300
funny, when I
began this course,

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.667
I mean when I began
teaching years ago,

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:04.500
Woolworth's were still
around.&nbsp; Ain't so much still

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:11.167
around anymore, but the, but
the history still is.&nbsp; So

00:40:11.167 --> 00:40:13.200
the men go to the lunch
counter and insist on being

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.167
served.&nbsp; They could buy
things other places in the

00:40:16.167 --> 00:40:17.400
store, but they couldn't
be served at the lunch

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.800
counter.&nbsp; The
waitress says, " I can't,

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.567
you know, I
can't help you out."

00:40:22.567 --> 00:40:24.200
And they sit
there, and they sit,

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.100
and they sit, and they sit,
taking up four seats at the

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:31.867
lunch counter.&nbsp;
It's a wildcat sit-in.

00:40:31.867 --> 00:40:34.400
It's not the first by
any stretch.&nbsp; The March on

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.100
Washington Movement had
been organizing them for

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.500
decades.&nbsp; Labor movements
have been organizing them

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.700
for decades.&nbsp; But
this time it takes off.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:42.667
You have just the
right mix of electricity,

00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:45.400
of anticipation, of
possibility and frustration

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.400
certainly.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.400
And you see across the
country sit-ins by people

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.700
your age, all
across the South.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.867
Sixty cities become
sites of sit-ins,

00:40:56.867 --> 00:41:01.600
and all of these sit-ins,
the young men and women are

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:05.967
well dressed and impeccably
mannered.&nbsp; To do anything

00:41:05.967 --> 00:41:11.700
else would invite potential
death.&nbsp; Ella Baker,

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:18.467
the person who's essentially
running the SCLC--King's the

00:41:18.467 --> 00:41:20.800
head of it, but Ella
Baker's running it,

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:26.100
ministering it--taps into
this energy and organizes a

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.667
youth conference in
Raleigh, North Carolina,

00:41:28.667 --> 00:41:34.300
in April.&nbsp; She's expecting
sort of a modest turnout.&nbsp;

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:39.300
Overwhelming turnout,
and overwhelming energy.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.900
"We, the college age
students of the day,

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.167
need to do something.&nbsp; We
are ready."&nbsp; And out of that

00:41:45.167 --> 00:41:47.500
organization grows
the Southern Nonviolent

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.700
Coordinating Committee,
otherwise known as SNCC.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.500
I said Southern, I'm
sorry.&nbsp; Student Nonviolent

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.700
Coordinating Committee,
otherwise known as SNCC.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.200
SNCC would never become the
biggest of the great civil

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.500
rights organizations,
but more than any,

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.867
any other organization, it
becomes the barometer of an

00:42:10.867 --> 00:42:13.367
evolution, of the
evolution of 1960s ideology.

00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:17.900
And SNCC will be part of, of
the narrative that I lay out

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.667
over the next two and a
half weeks of the course,

00:42:20.667 --> 00:42:23.667
because through them,
you can actually see the

00:42:23.667 --> 00:42:25.700
changes, and really
quite radical changes,

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.600
in movement ideology during
the 1960s.&nbsp; But at its

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.600
founding moment
in April in 1960,

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:41.900
SNCC is a group of
college-age individuals who

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.867
espoused
nonviolent ideology,

00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:47.867
who are
absolutely interracial,

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.900
and who wanted to be
organized through a

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:57.800
non-hierarchical
system.&nbsp; They are,

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:03.000
from the beginning, seen as
a temporary organization,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.500
literally given a corner
space in the offices of the

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.800
SCLC headquarters.&nbsp; So it
was operating under SCLC's

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.567
umbrella, SCLC thinking,
"This is a great way to get

00:43:14.567 --> 00:43:19.400
more youth involved in our
movement."&nbsp; You could even

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:20.867
look back to the founding
moment and see there's

00:43:20.867 --> 00:43:25.400
already some fissures
in the relationship,

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.667
if only because SNCC,
the Student Nonviolent

00:43:28.667 --> 00:43:30.467
Coordinating
Committee, is committed to a

00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:34.100
non-hierarchical
organ--organizing logic.&nbsp;

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:37.267
They, like Ella Baker, are
a little bit nervous in the

00:43:37.267 --> 00:43:39.700
fact that SCLC is
embodied in King,

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.600
a magnificent man, but
a far from perfect man,

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.700
but only one man, and they
wanted an organization that

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:53.700
had many leaders.&nbsp; Now
that's April 1960.&nbsp; Heading

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.800
into the fall, in October,
King was arrested in Atlanta

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.500
for violating,
violating probation,

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:10.100
on trumped-up charges, and
he's sentenced to four--I

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.400
mean, I think it was
a traffic violation.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.600
He's sentenced to four
months hard labor.&nbsp; John F.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.767
Kennedy, who is campaigning
for the presidency,

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.900
calls Coretta Scott King and
says that he will protect

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:29.367
King.&nbsp; He actually had no
way of protecting King,

00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:30.700
but in
orchestrated phone calls,

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:33.367
"I will do everything I can
to protect your husband."&nbsp;

00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:38.900
And with that, black support
for Kennedy mushrooms.&nbsp;

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:49.100
Kennedy goes on to win by a
hundred and twenty thousand

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:51.500
votes--still debates whether
those votes actually existed

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.200
or not--but he won by a
hundred and twenty thousand

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.700
votes, and it's clear
that it's African American

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.067
support, support that swung
the election his direction.&nbsp;

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:08.700
Blacks have in JFK the kind
of leader at a symbolic and

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:12.600
cultural level they have not
had since FDR started making

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.267
these gestures towards
recognizing blacks' needs

00:45:17.267 --> 00:45:21.300
some twenty-five, thirty
years earlier.&nbsp; In 1961--I'm

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:27.300
skipping a ton of details.&nbsp;
I'm trying to get up to a

00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:33.800
moment of the most
famous crisis--in 1961,

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.400
CORE, the Congress
of Racial Equality,

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.900
as I mentioned in
the last lecture,

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.800
organizes a, a new
round of freedom rides,

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:44.600
getting on buses,
integrated riders,

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.900
and crossing state lines.&nbsp;
Members of SNCC are on the

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:55.867
bus as well.&nbsp;
Students from Yale,

00:45:55.867 --> 00:45:58.767
from other places
in Connecticut,

00:45:58.767 --> 00:46:02.800
jump on these buses and head
on South.&nbsp; Once they cross

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:06.800
into the Deep South, the
buses are attacked by smoke

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:10.600
bombs, tires are slashed.&nbsp;
As people run out of the

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.100
buses to get away
from the smoke,

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.100
they're met by mobs who
beat them with their fists,

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:22.600
with metal poles.&nbsp; The buses
are torched.&nbsp; Other buses

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:26.967
are sent down.&nbsp; Eventually,
the buses arrive down in

00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:32.700
Birmingham, Alabama,
where Bull Connor,

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.500
the Commissioner
of Public Safety,

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:38.000
knows they're coming, knows
there's a mob waiting for

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.100
them at the bus station,
and does not offer police

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:46.500
protection, and
lets the students,

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:49.200
the riders, get beaten
senseless for fifteen

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.567
minutes before
letting the police come,

00:46:51.567 --> 00:46:52.900
before releasing the police.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.767
And people said, "Well, why
did you do such a thing?"&nbsp;

00:46:56.767 --> 00:46:58.800
He goes, "It
was Mother's Day.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.667
You can't take a man away
from his mother.&nbsp; You know,

00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:05.767
they needed to have time
spent with their mother.&nbsp;

00:47:05.767 --> 00:47:08.900
You know, they would get
there in time."&nbsp; There's a

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.400
dawning at this moment, with
this kind of violence and

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:16.000
recalcitrance, of a
militancy within SNCC and

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.967
the beginnings of a move
away from respectability.&nbsp;

00:47:19.967 --> 00:47:23.867
You start seeing different
agendas being articulated

00:47:23.867 --> 00:47:26.900
within different
organizations.&nbsp; The movement

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.800
is going in fits and
starts.&nbsp; Federations form

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:33.100
and break apart.&nbsp; There's
all kinds of infighting,

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:37.000
and things seemed on the
verge of collapse in Albany,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Georgia, when they go to
invoke another crisis.&nbsp; And

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.300
in Albany, Georgia, where
you have a confederation of

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.900
different civil rights
organizations coming

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.900
together, to try to
change that town,

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:54.667
they're outsmarted by
the white police.&nbsp; As the

00:47:54.667 --> 00:47:56.500
students try to start
filling up the jails to

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.200
create a crisis of
overcrowding and,

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.600
and get national
sympathy, with the jail,

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.367
no bail strategy "We'll let
ourselves be in jail.&nbsp; We

00:48:02.367 --> 00:48:04.700
won't accept bail.&nbsp; They'll
have to force us out.&nbsp; We

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.600
won't have paid any bail.&nbsp;
This will be great."&nbsp; The

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.767
police chief says, "We're
going to keep our heads and

00:48:10.767 --> 00:48:13.667
start shuttling people out
of jails to other jails."

00:48:13.667 --> 00:48:18.600
He doesn't react,
essentially.&nbsp; Nothing

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:21.100
happens.&nbsp;
Everything fizzles,

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:23.700
and there's a fear that
this movement that began,

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.167
quote, "began," in
quotes, with Brown v.

00:48:26.167 --> 00:48:28.400
Board and has these violent
reactions as you see it with

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.500
Rosa Parks, and you
see it with Emmett Till,

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:34.267
and you see it in
Central High School,

00:48:34.267 --> 00:48:36.367
the beginning of a new
sort of vibrant youth

00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:40.100
organization, it feels like
it's all going to collapse

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:44.000
in Albany, Georgia, because
the white officers realized,

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.500
"If we don't react, this
thing will go away."&nbsp; Well,

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:51.067
thank god for Bull Connor.&nbsp;
I'll let the film tell you

00:48:51.067 --> 00:48:52.667
much of that story, but
suffice it to say that

00:48:52.667 --> 00:48:55.100
Connor did more,
through his brutality,

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.700
to help win converts to
the civil rights movement,

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.100
more than anybody else
could have practically done.

00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.700
I'll pick up on that
moment, on that fact,

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.700
at the next
lecture.&nbsp; Thank you.

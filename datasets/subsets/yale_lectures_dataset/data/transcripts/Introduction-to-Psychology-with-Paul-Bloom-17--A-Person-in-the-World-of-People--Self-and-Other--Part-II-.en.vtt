00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.360
Professor Paul Bloom:
Just to review,

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.393
here's where we left off.
The discussion from last

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:24.485
lecture and for about half of
this lecture is going to be

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:28.028
social psychology.
And so, we started off by

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:32.285
talking about certain
fundamental biases in how we see

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:35.017
ourselves.
We then turned to talk about a

00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:37.718
bias and how we see other
people, the fundamental

00:00:37.718 --> 00:00:41.333
attribution error.
And now we're talking a little

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.470
bit about some aspects of how we
see other people.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.727
So, we quickly talked about
certain aspects of why we like

00:00:51.727 --> 00:00:55.570
other people including
proximity,

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.800
similarity, and attractiveness,
and where we left off was a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.750
discussion of the Matthew
effect,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.349
which is basically that good
things tend to compound.

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:07.019
If you're rich you'll get a
better education,

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:09.506
if you're smart people will
like you more,

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:13.417
if you're attractive and so on.
Nobody bring up their papers at

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:16.090
this point.
They'll collect them at the end

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.574
of class.
What I want to talk to--

00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:30.610
[laughter]
Okay, except for you.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.496
Just hand me it now.
[laughter]

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:38.523
I'm going to ask the teaching
fellows to stop anybody from

00:01:38.523 --> 00:01:41.831
approaching that area.
I want to begin by talking

00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:44.025
about [laughter]
impression formation,

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:46.220
how we form impressions of
others,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.120
and tell you a couple of
interesting things about

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.057
impression formation.
The first one is,

00:01:54.057 --> 00:02:01.530
first impressions matter a lot.
They matter a lot for different

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.667
reasons.
They might matter a lot because

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:08.253
humans have, in general,
a confirmation bias such that

00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:12.244
once you believe something other
information is then encoded

00:02:12.244 --> 00:02:15.560
along the likes to support what
you believe.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.456
So, the classic study here was
done by Kelley where a guest

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:23.152
speaker comes in and some of the
students received a bio

00:02:23.152 --> 00:02:25.840
describing the speaker as very
warm,

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.362
the other as--do not bring your
paper up if you're coming in

00:02:29.362 --> 00:02:34.139
late.
Just--at the end of class, yeah.

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.962
[laughter]
Others got a bio

00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:38.975
saying--thanks,
Erik--the speaker was rather

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.199
cold and then it turned out
later on [laughter]

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.984
when they're asked for their
impressions of the speaker

00:02:45.984 --> 00:02:50.400
people are very much biased by
what they first assumed.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.836
If I'm described to you as a
vivacious and creative person

00:02:54.836 --> 00:02:58.962
and you see me and I'm all kind
of bouncing around and

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:02.011
everything,
you could then confirm this as,

00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:04.500
"Look how vivacious and
creative he is."

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.802
If I'm described as somebody
who drinks too much,

00:03:06.802 --> 00:03:08.530
you might think he's an
alcoholic.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.363
If he's described as somebody
who's insecure and nervous,

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:16.060
you could interpret my activity
as nervous twitches.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.153
Your first impression sets a
framework from which you

00:03:19.153 --> 00:03:22.142
interpret everything else.
This was the theme of an

00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:25.283
excellent movie called Being
There starring Peter

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:27.446
Sellers.
And the running joke of the

00:03:27.446 --> 00:03:30.270
movie "Being There" was that the
main character,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.765
the character Chauncey Gardner,
somehow through accident had

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:38.270
the reputation for being a
genius but while,

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.949
in reality, he was actually
mildly retarded.

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.183
But he would go around and
people would ask him his

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:48.740
opinions on politics and he
would say things like "Well,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.593
I like being in the garden."
And because of his reputation

00:03:52.593 --> 00:03:54.500
as a genius people said,
"Wow.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.169
That's very profound.
I wonder what he means."

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.502
And--or people would talk to
him and he'd just stare at them

00:04:01.502 --> 00:04:04.721
and say--and people would
say--would be intimidated by his

00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:08.110
bold and impetuous stare when
actually he just totally didn't

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.305
know anything.
So, first impressions can shape

00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:15.169
subsequent impressions not just
when dealing with people.

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:19.767
A little while ago there was a
sniper, actually a pair of

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:24.118
snipers killing people in
Washington and the one thing

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:29.290
everybody knew about it was
there was a white van involved.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.821
It turned out there was no
white van at all but in the

00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:35.620
first incident somebody saw a
white van,

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.903
this was reported in all the
newspapers, then every other

00:04:38.903 --> 00:04:41.660
incident people started seeing
the white van.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.545
So, they started looking for
them and they started to

00:04:43.545 --> 00:04:46.228
attending--attend to them.
So, first impressions matter

00:04:46.228 --> 00:04:49.804
hugely when dealing with people
because it sets the stage for

00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:51.949
how we interpret everything
else.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.135
A second finding building on
the first is that we form

00:04:58.135 --> 00:05:02.220
impressions very fast,
very quickly,

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.290
and this is a literature known
as "thin slices."

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.982
The idea is you don't have to
see much of a person to get an

00:05:11.982 --> 00:05:15.152
impression of what they are.
The first studies done on this

00:05:15.152 --> 00:05:17.649
were actually done on teachers,
on university professors.

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.928
So, university professors have
teaching evaluations and you

00:05:20.928 --> 00:05:24.093
could use this as a rough and
ready approximation of what

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:27.796
students think of them.
So, what you do then is--the

00:05:27.796 --> 00:05:31.294
question that these people were
interested in,

00:05:31.294 --> 00:05:35.338
Rosenthal and Ambady,
two social psychologists,

00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:40.567
were how long do you have to
look at a professor to guess how

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:44.332
popular a teacher he is?
So, they showed these clips for

00:05:44.332 --> 00:05:46.101
a full class.
Do you have to see them for a

00:05:46.101 --> 00:05:48.166
full class?
Do you have to see them for two

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:51.370
classes?
Do you have to see them for a

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.454
half hour?
How long do you have to be

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:59.014
around a person to see him,
to estimate how good a lecturer

00:05:59.014 --> 00:06:02.730
that person is?
And the answer is five seconds.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.664
So, after clips of five seconds
people are pretty good at

00:06:06.664 --> 00:06:10.247
predicting what sort of
evaluations that person will

00:06:10.247 --> 00:06:14.012
have.
Remember "The Big Five," how we

00:06:14.012 --> 00:06:17.550
evaluate people on "The Big
Five?"

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.686
Well, you have a roommate and
your roommate you could evaluate

00:06:22.686 --> 00:06:25.627
on "The Big Five."
You've had a lot of experience

00:06:25.627 --> 00:06:28.537
with him or her.
How much time do you need to

00:06:28.537 --> 00:06:33.009
evaluate somebody on the five
dimensions of personality?

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:35.750
The answer is,
again, not much time at all.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.321
After very brief exposures to
people, people are very accurate

00:06:40.321 --> 00:06:43.319
at identifying them on "The Big
Five."

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:49.138
One of the more surprising
findings is--concerns sexual

00:06:49.138 --> 00:06:54.516
orientation or "gaydar."
That's not a scientific term

00:06:54.516 --> 00:06:58.290
[laughter]
but the same psychologists were

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.443
interested in studying how
quickly you can--if at all how

00:07:03.443 --> 00:07:09.610
long does it take to figure out
somebody's sexual orientation?

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.836
Now, what they did was--they
were clever psychologists so

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:18.441
they set it up in a study where
the people did not know sexual

00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:21.527
orientation was at issue.
So, for instance,

00:07:21.527 --> 00:07:24.062
they may be people like you who
filled in a form,

00:07:24.062 --> 00:07:26.702
one question along a very long
form was your sexual

00:07:26.702 --> 00:07:28.973
orientation,
and then you're sitting down

00:07:28.973 --> 00:07:31.719
being interviewed by somebody
and your interview is being

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:33.713
filmed,
and then other people are

00:07:33.713 --> 00:07:36.480
shown--who don't know you are
shown the film.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:44.025
And the finding is that people
based on thin slices are quite

00:07:44.025 --> 00:07:48.930
good at detecting sexual
orientation.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.114
Everybody's good at it,
gay people are better at it

00:07:52.114 --> 00:07:55.426
than straight people,
and, again, you don't need much

00:07:55.426 --> 00:07:57.790
time.
You just need about a second.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.300
You see somebody for about a
second, you could make a guess.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.308
You're far from always right.
In fact, you're just a bit

00:08:04.308 --> 00:08:07.186
better than chance but you are
better than chance at telling

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:09.916
sexual orientation.
So, these two facts taken

00:08:09.916 --> 00:08:13.759
together, thin slices and the
power of first impressions,

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:17.553
means that just by a brief
exposure to somebody it shapes

00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:21.889
so much of how you're going to
think about them in the future.

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:24.350
Now, we can look at this from
the other direction.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.720
We're talking about the
perceptions of other people,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.594
how we perceive other people,
but social psychologists are

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:35.635
also interested in the question
of what happens to other people

00:08:35.635 --> 00:08:38.960
as a result of being perceived
in a certain way.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.708
So, one question is,
"What would cause me to

00:08:42.708 --> 00:08:47.851
perceive somebody as intelligent
or stupid, gay or straight,

00:08:47.851 --> 00:08:51.558
anxious or level-headed?"
A second question is,

00:08:51.558 --> 00:08:54.309
"What are the effects of being
judged that way?"

00:08:54.309 --> 00:08:59.043
And psychologists have coined a
term, talk about self-fulfilling

00:08:59.043 --> 00:09:01.624
prophesies,
and the claim here more

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:05.529
specifically is what's known as
"the Pygmalion effect."

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:10.704
And the Pygmalion effect is if
I believe you have a certain

00:09:10.704 --> 00:09:15.968
characteristic this might cause
you to behave as if you have

00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:20.402
that characteristic.
The name comes from the play by

00:09:20.402 --> 00:09:23.211
George Bernard Shaw
Pygmalion,

00:09:23.211 --> 00:09:27.425
and the quote here is "The
difference between a lady and a

00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:32.009
flower girl is not how she
behaves but how she's treated.

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:35.056
I shall always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins because he

00:09:35.056 --> 00:09:37.659
always treats me as a flower
girl and always will,"

00:09:37.659 --> 00:09:41.590
made into a better known movie,
My Fair Lady.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.835
But I think that the same theme
is better exemplified in a far

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.151
better movie,
La Femme Nikita,

00:09:49.151 --> 00:09:54.057
where a cold-blooded killer is
treated with respect and

00:09:54.057 --> 00:09:59.599
affection and then she becomes a
much more warm and accessible

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:02.520
person,
and then she kills a lot of

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.249
people but that--[laughter]
but still it illustrates the

00:10:06.249 --> 00:10:09.618
point.
And this point has tons of

00:10:09.618 --> 00:10:14.086
empirical validity.
The classic experiment was by

00:10:14.086 --> 00:10:19.263
Rosenthal and Jackson where they
told teachers that some of their

00:10:19.263 --> 00:10:24.360
kids were really smart and other
kids were less--were not really

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.487
smart,
they weren't expected to show a

00:10:27.487 --> 00:10:31.313
huge jump or spurt in their IQ,
and this was of course

00:10:31.313 --> 00:10:34.174
trickery.
The children were chosen at

00:10:34.174 --> 00:10:38.311
random but the children who were
described as showing--as

00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:43.454
expected to show a jump in IQ,
in fact, did show a jump in

00:10:43.454 --> 00:10:47.259
their IQ scores and this isn't
magic.

00:10:47.259 --> 00:10:50.875
It's basically--if I am told
that you're a genius and your

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:54.111
genius is about to be in
full-flower throughout this

00:10:54.111 --> 00:10:57.600
class and it's a small class as
these classes were,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.021
I'll focus more on you,
I'll give you more of my

00:11:00.021 --> 00:11:03.284
attention.
If I'm told "not so much for

00:11:03.284 --> 00:11:06.779
you," you'll suffer relative to
him.

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:13.893
And so the Pygmalion effect
shows how our expectations can

00:11:13.893 --> 00:11:17.564
really matter.
This brings us to the

00:11:17.564 --> 00:11:22.347
final--the issue of expectations
and how we judge people is a

00:11:22.347 --> 00:11:26.891
story that could be told about
individuals but it's also a

00:11:26.891 --> 00:11:30.320
story that could be told about
groups.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.070
And this is where I want to end
this section on social

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.990
psychology by talking about
groups.

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:43.151
A lot of social psychology is
concerned with the question of

00:11:43.151 --> 00:11:47.520
how we think about human groups
and we've already discussed this

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.403
in the lecture on morality when
we talked about the human

00:11:51.403 --> 00:11:55.564
dynamic pushing us to think in
terms of "us" versus "them" as

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:59.794
shown in the Robber's Cave study
and also shown in the minimal

00:11:59.794 --> 00:12:04.509
group research by Tajfel showing
that from a motivational,

00:12:04.509 --> 00:12:08.327
emotional standpoint it's not
difficult for us to think in

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:11.139
terms of "my group" versus "your
group."

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:14.176
And this way of thinking has
real consequences for our

00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:16.124
emotional life,
our affective life,

00:12:16.124 --> 00:12:18.759
and how we choose to distribute
resources.

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:23.113
What I want to talk about here
though is a different aspect of

00:12:23.113 --> 00:12:27.488
how we think about human groups.
I want to talk a little bit

00:12:27.488 --> 00:12:32.993
about stereotypes.
Now, "stereotypes" in English

00:12:32.993 --> 00:12:38.574
often just is a bad word.
To have a stereotype is to

00:12:38.574 --> 00:12:41.529
be--is to have something wrong
with you.

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:44.019
You might say it's not good to
have stereotypes.

00:12:44.019 --> 00:12:47.539
Psychologists tend to use the
term in a broader sense.

00:12:47.539 --> 00:12:52.210
We tend to use the term to
refer to information we have

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:57.659
about categories and intuitions
we have about the typicality,

00:12:57.659 --> 00:13:01.009
our frequency of certain
features of categories.

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:05.107
And it turns out that
collecting information about

00:13:05.107 --> 00:13:08.620
categories is essential to our
survival.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:14.369
We see novel things all the
time and if we were not capable

00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:18.956
of learning and making guesses,
educated guesses,

00:13:18.956 --> 00:13:23.450
about these novel things we
would not be able to survive.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:28.539
So, when you see this object
over here you categorize it as a

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:33.629
chair and you recognize that you
could probably sit on it.

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:38.383
This apple is probably edible,
this dog probably barks and has

00:13:38.383 --> 00:13:42.669
a tail and eat me--eats me and
doesn't speak English.

00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:46.509
These are all stereotypes about
chairs and about apples and

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:49.074
about dogs.
It doesn't mean they're

00:13:49.074 --> 00:13:52.362
logically true.
This could be a vegetarian dog,

00:13:52.362 --> 00:13:54.668
a poison apple,
an explosive chair,

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:57.450
but [laughter]
they're typically true.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.631
And if you were suddenly
stripped of your ability to make

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.789
generalizations,
you'd be at a loss.

00:14:02.789 --> 00:14:04.830
You wouldn't know what to eat,
how to interact.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:09.216
So, some sort of ability to
record information and make

00:14:09.216 --> 00:14:14.008
generalizations is absolutely
essential to making it through

00:14:14.008 --> 00:14:16.803
life.
What's interesting though is we

00:14:16.803 --> 00:14:21.033
also categorize types of people.
So, we have stereotypes in our

00:14:21.033 --> 00:14:23.811
heads about men and women,
about children,

00:14:23.811 --> 00:14:26.319
adolescents or adults,
whites, blacks,

00:14:26.319 --> 00:14:31.516
Asians and so on.
Now, this is not essentially a

00:14:31.516 --> 00:14:35.840
bad thing for a couple of
reasons.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.570
First, some of these
stereotypes are positive.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.007
You might have positive
stereotypes about certain

00:14:44.007 --> 00:14:46.874
groups.
You might believe some groups

00:14:46.874 --> 00:14:49.610
are unusually creative or
intelligent.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.627
You might have a particularly
positive stereotype about your

00:14:53.627 --> 00:14:57.712
own group even if your own group
is Yale students or your own

00:14:57.712 --> 00:15:01.729
group is people from France or
your own group is people from

00:15:01.729 --> 00:15:05.090
such and so college.
You might have positive

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:07.071
stereotypes.
More importantly,

00:15:07.071 --> 00:15:10.699
we collect stereotypes about
groups of people through much

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:13.945
the same way we collect
stereotypes about categories

00:15:13.945 --> 00:15:18.861
like chairs and apples and dogs.
And so they're pretty often

00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:22.309
accurate.
When there are studies which

00:15:22.309 --> 00:15:27.487
ask people who is more likely to
be a lawyer, someone who's

00:15:27.487 --> 00:15:30.789
Jewish or someone who is
Hispanic,

00:15:30.789 --> 00:15:34.621
who is likely to be taller,
somebody from Japan or somebody

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:37.659
from Sweden, people can answer
these things.

00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:40.249
They have their stereotypes
that guide their answers,

00:15:40.249 --> 00:15:42.539
and the answers are not
arbitrary or random.

00:15:42.539 --> 00:15:46.736
Their answers are often correct
and often possessing stereotypes

00:15:46.736 --> 00:15:50.467
lets us make reasonable and
correct generalizations about

00:15:50.467 --> 00:15:54.050
the world.
That's the sort of good news

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:58.309
about stereotypes but there's
also bad news.

00:15:58.309 --> 00:16:02.985
One problem is that they're not
always accurate and there's a

00:16:02.985 --> 00:16:07.659
couple of factors that could
lead them away from accuracy.

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:10.921
One is what we talked about
before regarding first

00:16:10.921 --> 00:16:13.850
impressions, which is a
confirmation bias.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:17.773
If you believe that homosexuals
are effeminate,

00:16:17.773 --> 00:16:22.806
that gay men are effeminate,
then this is going to shape how

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:26.966
you see future gay men.
If you see an effeminate gay

00:16:26.966 --> 00:16:30.280
man, you'll probably say,
"Ah, more evidence for my

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.496
theory."
If you see a man who is not

00:16:32.496 --> 00:16:35.964
effeminate, you might ignore it
or say maybe he's not really gay

00:16:35.964 --> 00:16:38.351
after all.
If you believe black men are

00:16:38.351 --> 00:16:41.753
criminals, then when you see a
black man who is a criminal

00:16:41.753 --> 00:16:45.514
you'll chalk it down as support
but you'll pay less attention to

00:16:45.514 --> 00:16:49.036
evidence that white men are
criminals and some black men are

00:16:49.036 --> 00:16:52.357
not criminals.
You won't look at this as a

00:16:52.357 --> 00:16:55.190
scientist objectively scanning
data.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:57.960
Rather, you'll be biased in
certain ways.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.052
You'll be biased to put extra
weight on the cases that support

00:17:03.052 --> 00:17:07.059
your theory and diminish cases
that refute it.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:09.764
Furthermore,
our data is not always

00:17:09.764 --> 00:17:15.433
reliable.
So--oh, and this is actually an

00:17:15.433 --> 00:17:21.629
example of this at work.
It turns out in the world of

00:17:21.629 --> 00:17:26.371
classical music there's a
stereotype of women being simply

00:17:26.371 --> 00:17:31.029
less proficient than men:
they play smaller than men,

00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:34.035
they don't have the same force
and they have smaller

00:17:34.035 --> 00:17:37.039
techniques, they're more
temperamental and so on.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:40.177
If you asked somebody who was a
judge, the judge would say,

00:17:40.177 --> 00:17:41.810
"Look.
This is just the way things are.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.675
I'm not being biased at all."
The test of this then is to

00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:49.703
have blind auditions where
people do their auditions behind

00:17:49.703 --> 00:17:53.940
a screen so you can't tell
whether they're man or a woman,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.218
or for that matter,
white or black or Asian or

00:17:57.218 --> 00:18:00.343
whatever.
It turns out when you do that

00:18:00.343 --> 00:18:04.669
women get hired far more
suggesting that the stereotype

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:06.788
is A,
incorrect and B,

00:18:06.788 --> 00:18:12.609
has a real negative and unfair
effect on people getting hired.

00:18:12.609 --> 00:18:16.653
A second problem is – what I
was talking about immediately

00:18:16.653 --> 00:18:20.834
before this – is some of our
data are misleading so we get a

00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:24.809
lot of the information about the
world from the media.

00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:29.926
The media would include
television and movies but would

00:18:29.926 --> 00:18:34.000
also include plays and books and
stories.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.322
And to the extent these portray
an unrealistic or unfair or

00:18:38.322 --> 00:18:42.794
biased perception of the world
we could construct stereotypes

00:18:42.794 --> 00:18:47.116
that are faithful to the data
we're getting but the data is

00:18:47.116 --> 00:18:50.259
not representative.
And so people,

00:18:50.259 --> 00:18:54.005
for instance,
object to the fact that when

00:18:54.005 --> 00:18:59.396
there's Italian Americans on TV
they're often members of the

00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:04.029
Sopranos, a mobster family.
Throughout history Jews have

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:07.815
been upset at the portrayal of
Shylock in "Merchant of Venice,"

00:19:07.815 --> 00:19:11.385
not a very nice guy.
And often in response people

00:19:11.385 --> 00:19:16.104
who want to foster more positive
views will often try to--will

00:19:16.104 --> 00:19:20.436
often put in representatives
from other groups in unusual

00:19:20.436 --> 00:19:24.787
ways to make that point.
Anybody here ever see the

00:19:24.787 --> 00:19:28.750
television show Battlestar
Galactica?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.049
Okay.
Who's that?

00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:36.390
He's the star of "Battlestar
Galactica."

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:39.640
You don't know because you're
too young.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.491
In the original
"Battlestar"--[laughter]

00:19:43.491 --> 00:19:45.935
and I hate you.
[laughter]

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:50.450
In the original "Battlestar
Galactica," this was the star.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.457
This was the main character
known as "Starbuck," who got

00:19:55.457 --> 00:20:00.009
transformed into a woman in the
more recent one,

00:20:00.009 --> 00:20:03.734
a sort of example of how
portrayals are shifting in

00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:07.120
interesting ways.
There's also,

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:13.789
of course, moral problems over
stereotypes.

00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:18.783
So, it's fine to judge chairs
and apples and dogs based on the

00:20:18.783 --> 00:20:22.083
stereotypes.
It's even fine to judge breeds

00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:25.517
of dogs.
If I told you that I decided to

00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:31.271
buy a greyhound instead of a pit
bull because I wanted a dog of a

00:20:31.271 --> 00:20:35.108
gentle temperament,
nobody would scream that I'm a

00:20:35.108 --> 00:20:38.330
dog racist [laughter]
involving--and--but honestly,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:40.852
it's a stereotype.
Greyhounds are supposed to be

00:20:40.852 --> 00:20:42.799
more passive and gentle than pit
bulls.

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:45.805
I think it's a true stereotype
but it's a stereotype

00:20:45.805 --> 00:20:48.650
nonetheless.
But we have no problems when it

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.170
comes to things like breeds of
dogs with stereotypes.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.519
We have serious problems
judging people this way.

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:58.662
So, for instance,
it's a moral principle that

00:20:58.662 --> 00:21:02.948
some of us would hold to that
even if stereotypes are correct

00:21:02.948 --> 00:21:07.019
it is still immoral to apply
them in day to day life.

00:21:07.019 --> 00:21:10.380
The term for this would be
"profiling."

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:14.492
Now, it gets complicated
because there are some cases

00:21:14.492 --> 00:21:18.210
where we do allow stereotypes to
play a role.

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.614
When you all go and get
driver's licenses or when you

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:25.019
did get driver's licenses you
have to pay higher auto

00:21:25.019 --> 00:21:29.698
insurance premiums than I do.
I think this is perfectly fair

00:21:29.698 --> 00:21:34.568
because young people like you
get into a lot more accidents

00:21:34.568 --> 00:21:38.178
with your reefer and your
alcohol [laughter]

00:21:38.178 --> 00:21:41.549
and so it is--now,
some of you are saying "that's

00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:44.097
a stereotype."
And it is a stereotype but it's

00:21:44.097 --> 00:21:47.869
a statistically robust one and
nobody lines up to protest this.

00:21:47.869 --> 00:21:52.390
It's an acceptable stereotype
to make a generalization from.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.044
On the other hand,
what if insurance companies

00:21:55.044 --> 00:21:58.583
determined that people from Asia
got into more accidents than

00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:01.534
people from Europe?
Would people be equally

00:22:01.534 --> 00:22:06.040
comfortable charging people from
Asia higher rates of insurance?

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.896
Almost certainly not.
So, the issues are complicated

00:22:09.896 --> 00:22:13.278
as to what sort of
generalizations we're--are

00:22:13.278 --> 00:22:16.200
reasonable to make and what
aren't.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.593
There's also a second problem.
Stereotypes have all sorts of

00:22:21.593 --> 00:22:24.627
effects.
Now, some of them are obvious

00:22:24.627 --> 00:22:27.457
effects.
If people--for instance,

00:22:27.457 --> 00:22:32.670
if people pull you over while
you're driving because you're

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.273
black,
this could have a huge effect

00:22:35.273 --> 00:22:39.168
on how you feel welcome in this
society on race relations and so

00:22:39.168 --> 00:22:41.364
on.
But some of the effects are

00:22:41.364 --> 00:22:45.690
more subtle and more interesting
and you might not expect this.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.621
And this is some work done by
the psychologist Claude Steele

00:22:49.621 --> 00:22:53.560
and his colleagues at Stanford.
And the issue is called

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:57.472
"stereotype threat."
Imagine you have a math test

00:22:57.472 --> 00:23:00.789
and this is the front of the
math test.

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:04.240
Claude Steele made an
interesting discovery.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.336
Here is how to make black
people do worse on this math

00:23:09.336 --> 00:23:11.410
test.
It's very simple.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:19.115
The finding is that if your
race or your group has a

00:23:19.115 --> 00:23:23.035
negative stereotype associated
with it in any particular

00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:26.424
domain,
being reminded of it serves as

00:23:26.424 --> 00:23:31.633
a stereotype threat and hence
damages your performance in all

00:23:31.633 --> 00:23:34.707
sorts of domains.
If the stereotype is "your

00:23:34.707 --> 00:23:37.794
group doesn't do good in this,"
if I remind you that you're a

00:23:37.794 --> 00:23:40.470
member of that group immediately
before doing it,

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.837
your performance will drop.
Now, you know how to make women

00:23:45.837 --> 00:23:51.552
do worse on math tests too,
like that, and this has a

00:23:51.552 --> 00:23:57.169
demonstrative effect.
So, stereotypes are complicated

00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:02.646
and morally fraught things.
When people study stereotypes

00:24:02.646 --> 00:24:07.354
they often make certain
distinctions between three

00:24:07.354 --> 00:24:13.120
levels of stereotypes and this
is nicely summarized here.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.967
There's "public."
If I asked you:

00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:21.090
One of the people running for
the Democratic nominee for

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.916
president is black,
another one is female--if I

00:24:24.916 --> 00:24:28.338
asked people to raise their
hands for who thinks that

00:24:28.338 --> 00:24:32.088
because being black or because
being female they should be

00:24:32.088 --> 00:24:35.509
automatically disqualified for
being president,

00:24:35.509 --> 00:24:37.930
few of you would raise your
hands.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:42.440
Those are your public
presentations of stereotypes.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.852
Even if I was to ask you on a
sheet of paper,

00:24:44.852 --> 00:24:48.032
you might deny it because you
might be afraid that it's not

00:24:48.032 --> 00:24:50.960
anonymous.
Then there is private.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.619
Private is what you really
think but you don't tell people.

00:24:55.619 --> 00:24:59.843
Some of you--some of the
population of the United States

00:24:59.843 --> 00:25:03.989
are not going to vote for
somebody because he or she is

00:25:03.989 --> 00:25:08.750
black but they won't tell you
but they know it to be true.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:12.563
That's common sense.
What's more interesting is

00:25:12.563 --> 00:25:17.372
below even that there may be
unconscious associations that

00:25:17.372 --> 00:25:22.350
work that people don't actually
know about but affects their

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:26.350
thoughts about race,
gender and other social groups.

00:25:30.539 --> 00:25:34.259
So, here are some data about
what people publicly say.

00:25:34.259 --> 00:25:37.795
This is the proportion of
people who say they will

00:25:37.795 --> 00:25:41.980
vote--they would vote for an
African American president.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.614
What's interesting is
when--around when I was born the

00:25:45.614 --> 00:25:48.700
answer in the United States was
about half.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.996
Now, it is as close to one
hundred percent as you can get

00:25:52.996 --> 00:25:54.519
it.
Here is another one.

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:58.224
This is also public stereotypes
of blacks, proportion of white

00:25:58.224 --> 00:26:00.350
respondents endorsing each
trait.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:05.810
Now, it's infinitesimal.
These numbers are so low they

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.731
could be dismissed as people
filling in the wrong things or

00:26:10.731 --> 00:26:15.567
making jokes or just being
confused compared to [laughter]

00:26:15.567 --> 00:26:19.299
stunningly superstitious high
rankings.

00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:25.141
And so, there's been a profound
change in public presentations,

00:26:25.141 --> 00:26:29.287
public views,
on race but what about implicit

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:32.020
views?
This gets more complicated.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:35.797
Here is a simple study.
This is the sort of study that

00:26:35.797 --> 00:26:38.912
you might do here at Yale.
What you might do,

00:26:38.912 --> 00:26:41.738
for instance,
is be sitting at a computer

00:26:41.738 --> 00:26:45.555
screen and you'll be given
incomplete words to fill out

00:26:45.555 --> 00:26:49.230
like "hos-" and you have to fill
out this word.

00:26:49.230 --> 00:26:53.040
What you don't know is that
pictures of black faces or

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.210
pictures of white faces are
being flashed on the screen but

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:01.452
they're being flashed on the
screen subliminally so fast you

00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:04.400
don't even know you're seeing
them.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:09.737
Still this has an effect.
When you see black faces

00:27:09.737 --> 00:27:14.122
subjects are more likely to fill
this with words like "hostile"

00:27:14.122 --> 00:27:18.789
while whites more likely to fill
it with words like "hospital."

00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:24.128
I will now welcome you to
participate in an experiment on

00:27:24.128 --> 00:27:28.176
implicit attitudes.
This was developed by Mahzarin

00:27:28.176 --> 00:27:31.860
Banaji who used to be at Yale
and now is in an inferior

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.613
university in Boston [laughter]
and it's called implicit

00:27:35.613 --> 00:27:39.433
attitudes test and it's the
biggest psychology experiment

00:27:39.433 --> 00:27:42.549
ever done in terms of people.
I don't know.

00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:46.010
A million people have
participated in this and you

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:49.541
could just go online,
implicit.harvard.edu and then

00:27:49.541 --> 00:27:53.319
you could do it yourself.
But we'll do it now as a group.

00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:56.281
If you did it in the lab or on
your computer screen,

00:27:56.281 --> 00:27:58.430
you would do it by pushing
buttons.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.220
We'll do it by speaking.
And it's very simple.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.855
You're going to see things over
here and they're either going to

00:28:06.855 --> 00:28:10.019
be words or they're going to be
pictures.

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:15.250
If it's an African American or
a bad word, a negative word,

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.037
I want you to shout out
"right," this side,

00:28:19.037 --> 00:28:22.403
"right."
If it's a white American or a

00:28:22.403 --> 00:28:25.790
good word, I want you to shout
out "left."

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:28.472
People ready.
Try to do it as fast as

00:28:28.472 --> 00:28:30.460
possible without making any
mistakes.

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:36.967
[laughter]
Because of the very loud wrong

00:28:36.967 --> 00:28:40.290
person we're going to try that
again.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:54.740
[laughter] Are you ready?
[audience response] Good.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:29:00.660
That is "congruent," congruent
according to a theory that says

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:06.289
that people, both African
Americans and white Americans,

00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:10.009
have biases to favor white
Americans over African

00:29:10.009 --> 00:29:12.450
Americans.
How do we know by this?

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.600
Well, we compare it.
That's "congruent."

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.395
Now, it's different.
If it's a white American or a

00:29:19.395 --> 00:29:23.970
bad word, say "right."
If it's an African American or

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.830
a good word, say "left."

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.321
Okay.
For all I could tell,

00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:40.899
people did equally well but
this experiment has been done

00:29:40.899 --> 00:29:44.668
tens of thousands of times and
you could do it yourself on a

00:29:44.668 --> 00:29:47.326
computer screen.
And this is one way of doing it

00:29:47.326 --> 00:29:49.705
but they'll alternate and
they'll give you different ones

00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:53.515
to shift around and everything.
And it turns out that this

00:29:53.515 --> 00:29:58.063
version people are slower at
than the other version

00:29:58.063 --> 00:30:02.885
suggesting that their
associations run one way and not

00:30:02.885 --> 00:30:06.633
the other.
And this work has been extended

00:30:06.633 --> 00:30:10.940
for all sorts of ways looking at
for example at gender,

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:16.352
looking at the connection
between women and English and

00:30:16.352 --> 00:30:19.460
men and math,
looking at age,

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.305
attitudes towards people who
are obese versus people who are

00:30:23.305 --> 00:30:27.217
thin, attitudes towards people
who are straight versus people

00:30:27.217 --> 00:30:30.088
who are gay,
and you could go online and do

00:30:30.088 --> 00:30:33.746
these studies and it'll give you
some feeling for the sort of

00:30:33.746 --> 00:30:36.490
implicit attitudes that we have
within us.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:41.440
Well, a legitimate question is
"Who cares?"

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.958
I mean, if you do the--If you
look at the results for the

00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:48.603
study, it turns out that there
is an association as bias to

00:30:48.603 --> 00:30:52.122
view white Americans as positive
and African Americans as

00:30:52.122 --> 00:30:55.830
negative but it shows up in half
a second difference.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.982
Who cares?
Well, there's two answers to

00:30:58.982 --> 00:31:02.002
this.
One answer is there are times

00:31:02.002 --> 00:31:06.509
in your life where half a second
can matter a lot.

00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:10.592
So, studies with police
officers using reaction time in

00:31:10.592 --> 00:31:14.373
split-second choices on who to
shoot find that your

00:31:14.373 --> 00:31:18.909
stereotypical attitudes play a
huge role in who you're likely

00:31:18.909 --> 00:31:23.370
to shoot when they're holding an
object in their hand that's

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:26.398
unclear.
Also, more generally,

00:31:26.398 --> 00:31:31.161
it could be that these implicit
attitudes play a role in

00:31:31.161 --> 00:31:35.151
judgment calls.
In cases where you have a hard

00:31:35.151 --> 00:31:38.880
decision to make,
you know you're not racist.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.447
You have no explicit racist
attitudes, honestly you really

00:31:42.447 --> 00:31:46.140
don't, but the argument is that
these stereotypes can affect

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.020
your behavior in all sorts of
subtle ways.

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.482
Here is one example.
What they do is they do an

00:31:52.482 --> 00:31:55.450
experiment where somebody is in
trouble.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:32:00.370
You hear a scream from outside
either from a black person or a

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.625
white person.
In one condition you're the

00:32:03.625 --> 00:32:07.031
only person around.
In another condition there's

00:32:07.031 --> 00:32:10.819
other people around you.
Now, we know from the work in

00:32:10.819 --> 00:32:14.944
the Bystander effect that in
general which one are we more

00:32:14.944 --> 00:32:18.346
likely to help in,
when we're the only person or

00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:20.630
multiple?
"Only," exactly.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.835
And in fact,
when it's the only person just

00:32:23.835 --> 00:32:28.491
about everybody helps regardless
of the color of the person in

00:32:28.491 --> 00:32:32.612
trouble but when you're with
other people there's a big

00:32:32.612 --> 00:32:35.789
difference.
Now, again this isn't--these

00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:38.809
things are not done with members
of the KKK.

00:32:38.809 --> 00:32:43.898
They're done with the standard
university undergraduates like

00:32:43.898 --> 00:32:49.071
you and these--and if you were
in this group you wouldn't say,

00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.478
"Oh.
I didn't want to help because

00:32:51.478 --> 00:32:54.850
the person's black."
Rather, what you would say is,

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:57.960
"Well, I didn't think it was
worth helping.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.655
There were other people around.
Someone else would help," but

00:33:00.655 --> 00:33:04.304
we know by looking at it that
this difference makes a real

00:33:04.304 --> 00:33:06.387
difference.
A final study,

00:33:06.387 --> 00:33:10.713
and this was done by my
colleague who just got hired

00:33:10.713 --> 00:33:15.216
here, Jack Dovidio,
who's done some wonderful work,

00:33:15.216 --> 00:33:20.064
looked at how people judge to
hire somebody based on their

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:23.418
recommendations.
This is a little bit of a

00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:26.568
confusing thing.
The green bars are the African

00:33:26.568 --> 00:33:29.158
Americans.
The blue bars are the white

00:33:29.158 --> 00:33:31.740
Americans.
And in some cases these people

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.785
have strong recommendations.
When they have strong

00:33:34.785 --> 00:33:38.212
recommendations in 1989 you're
willing to hire everybody,

00:33:38.212 --> 00:33:40.599
and this is not a difference at
all.

00:33:40.599 --> 00:33:44.289
But when their recommendations
are so-so, when it's a judgment

00:33:44.289 --> 00:33:47.313
call, the subjects are
significantly more likely to

00:33:47.313 --> 00:33:50.579
hire the white American than the
African American.

00:33:50.579 --> 00:33:55.140
Nineteen eighty-nine was a long
time ago but the same results

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.850
showed up in 1999.
The same results also showed up

00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:03.230
about a year and a half ago.
And again, this doesn't show

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:06.809
that people are explicit
terrible racists.

00:34:06.809 --> 00:34:10.217
It does show that people
possess these stereotypes that

00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:13.309
make a difference in their
real-world behavior.

00:34:13.309 --> 00:34:17.415
A way to put this all together
is in Trish Devine's

00:34:17.415 --> 00:34:21.849
automaticity theory,
which goes something like this.

00:34:21.849 --> 00:34:24.949
The idea is that everybody
holds stereotypes.

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:27.683
These are automatically
activated when we come into

00:34:27.683 --> 00:34:31.042
contact with individuals.
In order to not act in a

00:34:31.042 --> 00:34:34.730
stereotyped fashion,
we have to consciously push

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.113
them down,
we have to consciously override

00:34:38.113 --> 00:34:41.619
them, and that's possible,
but it takes work.

00:34:41.619 --> 00:34:45.649
It takes work both at the
individual level and it takes

00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:51.377
work at the group level.
Any questions or thoughts about

00:34:51.377 --> 00:34:53.710
this?
Yes.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:35:06.324
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:35:06.324 --> 00:35:13.634
It's a good question.
These results are surprising

00:35:13.634 --> 00:35:17.630
and disturbing and I said there
is work to be done at an

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:22.062
individual and group level and
this young man challenged me to

00:35:22.062 --> 00:35:25.860
be more explicit about that.
Here is one case.

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.368
We have job searches and
sometimes job--senior job

00:35:29.368 --> 00:35:33.663
searches involve the faculty
sitting in--around in a room and

00:35:33.663 --> 00:35:37.530
tossing out names and we use
these names as a basis for

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.472
further discussion.
"Hey, I wonder--What about that

00:35:40.472 --> 00:35:42.380
person?
That person does great work."

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.948
What we do now in the
psychology department is we make

00:35:45.948 --> 00:35:50.460
a special point of trying to get
names from disadvantaged groups,

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:54.070
not with an eye towards an
affirmative action policy but

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:58.141
rather because there's a lot of
evidence suggesting that people

00:35:58.141 --> 00:36:02.015
who are just as qualified don't
come to mind unless you make

00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:05.980
some sort of procedure to do it.
Here's another example.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.991
A lot of journals do blind
reviewing now because of the

00:36:08.991 --> 00:36:12.449
evidence I talked about before
regarding sexual stereotypes,

00:36:12.449 --> 00:36:15.879
that whether it has a male name
or a female name makes a

00:36:15.879 --> 00:36:18.218
difference.
So those are not--those are

00:36:18.218 --> 00:36:21.558
group level in that they're not
saying, "You get rid of your

00:36:21.558 --> 00:36:24.051
prejudices by trying harder."
It's rather,

00:36:24.051 --> 00:36:27.575
"Let's set up a system so that
your prejudices can't work," the

00:36:27.575 --> 00:36:29.223
blind auditions,
for instance,

00:36:29.223 --> 00:36:31.440
being a beautiful example of
that.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.352
At an individual level,
your question's a harder one

00:36:34.352 --> 00:36:37.779
and I'm not exactly sure what we
could do but I think what we

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:41.149
should do is be conscious of
these things and know that it's

00:36:41.149 --> 00:36:44.040
not enough to say,
"Well, I'm explicitly not

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.873
racist so I'll give everybody a
fair shake," but to recognize we

00:36:47.873 --> 00:36:51.219
might have biases and to work
hard to overcome them,

00:36:51.219 --> 00:36:54.425
not by overcorrecting in some
random way but trying to--if

00:36:54.425 --> 00:36:57.688
you're interested for instance
in qualifications setting up

00:36:57.688 --> 00:37:00.612
some system that these
qualifications can be observed

00:37:00.612 --> 00:37:04.280
absent knowledge of race or sex.
Yeah, in back.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:10.789
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:37:10.789 --> 00:37:12.619
Yes.
The question's a good one.

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:16.963
How much of this is due to
stereotypes and how much of this

00:37:16.963 --> 00:37:20.437
is due to an own-group bias?
So, the fact that--so,

00:37:20.437 --> 00:37:23.283
the experiments as I have
described them are to some

00:37:23.283 --> 00:37:26.602
extent ambiguous.
The fact that white Americans

00:37:26.602 --> 00:37:31.236
favor white Americans over black
Americans might be because of

00:37:31.236 --> 00:37:35.869
stereotypes but they also might
be of in-group favoritism.

00:37:35.869 --> 00:37:40.360
I think the answer is that both
play a role but some of the

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:44.618
effects are due to stereotypes
above and beyond in-group

00:37:44.618 --> 00:37:47.942
favoritism.
And one reason why we know that

00:37:47.942 --> 00:37:51.920
is in studies like the IAT,
the Implicit Attitudes Test.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:56.420
African Americans show much the
same effect as white Americans.

00:37:56.420 --> 00:38:00.217
So, African Americans also are
biased against African Americans

00:38:00.217 --> 00:38:04.413
and in favor of white Americans,
showing it doesn't reduce to

00:38:04.413 --> 00:38:08.640
group favoritism though that
probably plays a big role.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.074
Okay.
I'm going to shift and spend

00:38:13.074 --> 00:38:16.950
the rest of this class on a
couple of mysteries.

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:22.400
Here's a summary.
The first one is a minor

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.311
mystery.
I think we have some progress

00:38:24.311 --> 00:38:27.216
in explaining it.
The second one is a total

00:38:27.216 --> 00:38:29.020
mystery.
The first one's sleep.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.441
Sleep is a motivation.
It is a motivation like food or

00:38:38.441 --> 00:38:42.380
drink.
It is a form of torture.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:45.230
I won't get into definitions of
what torture is but it would

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:48.081
cause somebody tremendous pain
and anguish to keep them from

00:38:48.081 --> 00:38:50.379
sleeping.
When you're really tired sleep

00:38:50.379 --> 00:38:53.940
is what you want to do like when
you're really hungry you want to

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.770
eat.
How many people here on

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:59.467
average--from the beginning of
the semester until now get on

00:38:59.467 --> 00:39:02.600
average more than eight hours of
sleep a night?

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.920
That's good.
Good.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.489
There is a sort of school of
sleep macho.

00:39:08.489 --> 00:39:12.233
A sleep macho used to be "I
only get forty-two minutes of

00:39:12.233 --> 00:39:15.819
sleep a night."
Now sleep macho is "I sleep

00:39:15.819 --> 00:39:17.986
eleven hours."
[laughter]

00:39:17.986 --> 00:39:20.970
Who gets on average more than
seven?

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:25.947
On average more than six?
Who here has been making it

00:39:25.947 --> 00:39:28.957
since the beginning of the
semester on under six hours a

00:39:28.957 --> 00:39:31.110
night?
Okay.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.801
Anybody of you that has been
getting under five hours a

00:39:33.801 --> 00:39:35.969
night?
Okay.

00:39:35.969 --> 00:39:39.700
There is big individual
differences in how much sleep

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:44.149
people need and sleep itself is
what we spend a lot of our life

00:39:44.149 --> 00:39:48.526
on but it's very hard to study
and we didn't used to know much

00:39:48.526 --> 00:39:52.615
of it because you can't ask
people what's happening during

00:39:52.615 --> 00:39:57.710
it because they're sleeping so
you need sort of clever methods.

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.380
One such clever method is an
EEG.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.993
You bring somebody in the sleep
lab, you put electrodes on their

00:40:03.993 --> 00:40:06.975
scalp and you see what
these--what sort of electrical

00:40:06.975 --> 00:40:11.798
activities you get in the brain.
Right now many of you are

00:40:11.798 --> 00:40:18.419
showing irregular beta waves
suggesting intense comprehension

00:40:18.419 --> 00:40:22.452
and great intellectual focus.
[laughter]

00:40:22.452 --> 00:40:25.217
Some of you are awake but non
attentive and your brain's

00:40:25.217 --> 00:40:27.579
giving you these large,
regular alpha waves.

00:40:27.579 --> 00:40:30.909
Some of you are sound asleep,
deep in delta.

00:40:30.909 --> 00:40:34.274
[laughter]
When you sleep you get the

00:40:34.274 --> 00:40:37.341
following stages.
You start off with a transition

00:40:37.341 --> 00:40:38.800
period when you're falling
asleep.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.616
We call that stage I.
Then you get successively

00:40:42.616 --> 00:40:46.122
deeper, II through IV,
slow, irregular,

00:40:46.122 --> 00:40:51.559
high amplitude delta waves,
and then once you reach stage

00:40:51.559 --> 00:40:56.900
IV you start going up again,
up through stage III and II.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.349
Then REM sleep emerges,
rapid eye movement sleep.

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:05.328
REM sleep is neat because your
brain looks like it's wide awake

00:41:05.328 --> 00:41:09.307
but – and I'm going to talk a
little bit more in detail about

00:41:09.307 --> 00:41:13.519
this later – you're relaxed,
your rapid eye movements occur;

00:41:13.519 --> 00:41:17.615
that's where your--the name
comes from and dreams occur and

00:41:17.615 --> 00:41:21.639
then on a good night's sleep
you've got four to five sleep

00:41:21.639 --> 00:41:26.030
cycles and it looks like this.
You start off and you go down,

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.012
down, down, and then you come
up, then you get your first REM

00:41:30.012 --> 00:41:32.228
cycle,
again, again,

00:41:32.228 --> 00:41:37.579
again, again,
again, and then you wake up.

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:41.223
So, the general takeaway
message here is that there's two

00:41:41.223 --> 00:41:45.904
types of sleep.
There is slow-wave sleep or

00:41:45.904 --> 00:41:51.367
"quiet sleep."
Your eyes drift separately and

00:41:51.367 --> 00:41:57.550
slowly you're hard to wake up.
Then there is REM sleep.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:03.481
Your brain is active as if you
were awake, your EEGs are

00:42:03.481 --> 00:42:08.658
similar to waking,
paralyzed except for the eyes,

00:42:08.658 --> 00:42:13.619
oh, men get erections and you
have dreams.

00:42:13.619 --> 00:42:17.932
One sleep researcher joked that
these two are connected because

00:42:17.932 --> 00:42:21.688
what happens is dreams fly
around through the ether and

00:42:21.688 --> 00:42:26.070
then their erections serve as
antennas so you pick them up.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:32.079
[laughter]
Don't write that down.

00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:34.961
[laughter]
Why do we sleep and why don't

00:42:34.961 --> 00:42:40.183
we--why aren't we always awake?
There's a couple of answers to

00:42:40.183 --> 00:42:43.601
this.
Probably the best answer is our

00:42:43.601 --> 00:42:49.416
body is worn out during the day
and sleep is necessary to put it

00:42:49.416 --> 00:42:53.077
back into shape.
So, when you sleep growth

00:42:53.077 --> 00:42:57.655
producing hormone goes through
the body, your brain and other

00:42:57.655 --> 00:43:02.313
organs get restored,
there are--you need less food,

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:06.670
your immune system seems to be
hard at work,

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.974
and in fact,
one answer--people always

00:43:08.974 --> 00:43:12.649
wonder what happens if you'd
stop sleeping and the answer is

00:43:12.649 --> 00:43:15.702
not one discovered in the
laboratory but it's been

00:43:15.702 --> 00:43:20.559
recorded in different cases.
If you stop sleeping you die.

00:43:20.559 --> 00:43:22.849
You don't die in some dramatic
way.

00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:27.471
You get sick and then you die,
suggesting that sleeping is

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:31.768
good to keep you healthy.
And an analogy I like to think

00:43:31.768 --> 00:43:35.634
about is that your--when you
bring your car in to repair

00:43:35.634 --> 00:43:38.820
it--for repairs,
when you're repairing your car,

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.043
the first thing you do is you
stomp it and shut off the

00:43:42.043 --> 00:43:44.633
engine.
You make it stable and at rest

00:43:44.633 --> 00:43:49.397
so you can then work on repair.
A related view is that sleep

00:43:49.397 --> 00:43:54.672
emerged to preserve energy and
keep you out of trouble at

00:43:54.672 --> 00:43:57.914
night.
And these views are of course

00:43:57.914 --> 00:44:01.279
not incompatible.
This explains why we sleep at

00:44:01.279 --> 00:44:04.780
all and this probably explains
why we sleep at night.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.970
There are sleep disorders.
I won't go through them.

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:14.264
I just list a few of them here.
They're sort of bad things that

00:44:14.264 --> 00:44:15.780
could happen to you when you're
asleep.

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.618
One particularly trendy sleep
disorder that's been discovered

00:44:19.618 --> 00:44:23.519
recently are side effects of
sleeping pills such as Ambien.

00:44:23.519 --> 00:44:27.397
So, one of the bizarre side
effects is some people with

00:44:27.397 --> 00:44:30.916
Ambien while sleeping go
downstairs, open up their

00:44:30.916 --> 00:44:34.219
refrigerator and eat huge
amounts of food.

00:44:34.219 --> 00:44:36.700
[laughter]
A more recent side effect of

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.485
Ambien that's quite serious is
some people become--have the

00:44:40.485 --> 00:44:43.880
compulsion while they're
sleeping to go driving,

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:49.956
which is not good.
[laughter]

00:44:49.956 --> 00:44:54.473
What we're really interested in
though when it comes to sleep is

00:44:54.473 --> 00:44:57.460
dreams.
So, remember Hamlet.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.750
People--you've all studied
Hamlet, "to be or not to be."

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.615
That's all I know but basically
[laughter]

00:45:04.615 --> 00:45:07.969
he was deciding--he--I wrote
this down though.

00:45:07.969 --> 00:45:12.442
He was deciding whether or not
to kill himself and so he made

00:45:12.442 --> 00:45:15.408
up two lists.
The lists of reasons to kill

00:45:15.408 --> 00:45:19.369
himself were "the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune,"

00:45:19.369 --> 00:45:24.252
"a sea of troubles," and "the
heartache in the thousand

00:45:24.252 --> 00:45:27.869
natural shocks that flesh is
heir to."

00:45:27.869 --> 00:45:32.517
He only had one argument not to
kill himself:

00:45:32.517 --> 00:45:35.738
Nightmares.
"To sleep, perchance to dream,

00:45:35.738 --> 00:45:39.373
for in that sleep of death what
dreams may come when we have

00:45:39.373 --> 00:45:42.700
shuffled off this mortal coil
might give us pause."

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:46.525
He was worried about nightmares.
Now, dreams have always

00:45:46.525 --> 00:45:49.289
fascinated people and
philosophers.

00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:51.813
If you take a philosophy
course, there'll be a couple of

00:45:51.813 --> 00:45:54.199
questions about dreams that you
will wonder about.

00:45:54.199 --> 00:45:57.480
One is "Are you dreaming right
now?"

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:01.508
So, Rene Descartes famously
wondered whether the real world

00:46:01.508 --> 00:46:04.430
doesn't exist.
Maybe right now it's just a

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.750
dream.
See also "The Matrix."

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:09.880
And can you be immoral in a
dream?

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.420
We do all sorts of things in
dreams that are bad.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.417
Are these sins?
And the great theologians and

00:46:16.417 --> 00:46:19.573
philosophers like Augustine
wondered about this,

00:46:19.573 --> 00:46:23.469
can you sin in a dream?
I will answer both questions.

00:46:23.469 --> 00:46:27.581
You are not dreaming right now,
unless you're asleep but if

00:46:27.581 --> 00:46:31.409
you're--and you can't usually be
immoral in a dream.

00:46:31.409 --> 00:46:35.309
The exceptions are lucid dreams
where you choose what to dream

00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:38.568
about, and then possibly you
could be immoral if you

00:46:38.568 --> 00:46:43.110
encourage bad habits of thought.
What do we know about dreams?

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:47.548
Well, first there's a
distinction, a distinction

00:46:47.548 --> 00:46:51.610
between real dreams versus sleep
thought.

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:56.888
So, real dreams are you're in a
submarine wrestling a chicken

00:46:56.888 --> 00:47:01.200
while your grandmother looks
disapprovingly on.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:04.942
Those are real dreams.
"Sleep thought" is the sort of

00:47:04.942 --> 00:47:09.529
thing you get typically before
you fall asleep and it's like

00:47:09.529 --> 00:47:13.939
"did I take the garbage out,
where is the garbage,

00:47:13.939 --> 00:47:18.401
did I take the garbage out?"
And so it's really just this

00:47:18.401 --> 00:47:22.289
kind of rumination and you could
do this while you're sleeping.

00:47:22.289 --> 00:47:24.405
So, if you're woken up during
slow-wave sleep you're going to

00:47:24.405 --> 00:47:25.639
be thinking "Did I take
the--yes,

00:47:25.639 --> 00:47:28.230
while I was dreaming I was
thinking about the garbage," but

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:30.989
if you're woken up during REM,
"But a monkey was eating my

00:47:30.989 --> 00:47:32.860
grandmother," and that sort of
thing.

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:35.030
[laughter]
So, there is a distinction.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:38.865
What do people dream about?
Well, we know some facts about

00:47:38.865 --> 00:47:40.579
dreams.
Everybody dreams.

00:47:40.579 --> 00:47:43.610
Not everybody remembers their
dreams.

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:47.423
If you want to remember your
dream by the way keep your

00:47:47.423 --> 00:47:50.177
dreams--keep a dream diary,
very useful,

00:47:50.177 --> 00:47:53.920
but everybody dreams three to
four times a night.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.724
That depends on how much sleep
you get but dreams leave fragile

00:47:57.724 --> 00:48:00.409
memories.
They fade quickly.

00:48:00.409 --> 00:48:03.580
This is why a dream diary or
writing up--writing your dreams

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.160
as soon as you wake up turns out
to be useful.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.707
What do people dream about?
Well, basically,

00:48:08.707 --> 00:48:12.369
the way to find that out is you
ask people and people

00:48:12.369 --> 00:48:15.891
have--psychologists and
sociologists have collected

00:48:15.891 --> 00:48:19.521
dream reports.
If you go to dreambank.net,

00:48:19.521 --> 00:48:23.679
a guy named Hill collected
50,000 dream reports;

00:48:23.679 --> 00:48:26.330
you could make some
generalizations.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:31.040
Most dreams are bad.
They're not bad,

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.161
bad, they're not nightmares,
but most dreams are from a

00:48:35.161 --> 00:48:39.816
scale of one to ten with five
and a half in the middle they're

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:43.060
on the negative side.
They report misfortunes.

00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:51.128
People in tribal societies have
dreams with more physical

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:54.250
aggression than people in
industrialized societies.

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.289
Men have more aggressive dreams
than women.

00:48:57.289 --> 00:49:00.520
Americans have more aggressive
dreams than Europeans.

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.262
Yeah.
[laughter]

00:49:03.262 --> 00:49:06.260
What do people want to dream
about?

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.929
Well, psychologist--the
findings were totally not going

00:49:08.929 --> 00:49:11.762
to surprise you.
Women want to dream about

00:49:11.762 --> 00:49:15.797
romance and adventure.
Men want to dream about sex

00:49:15.797 --> 00:49:18.208
with strangers.
[laughter]

00:49:18.208 --> 00:49:23.926
Turns out that once you get
past the hormonal blast of

00:49:23.926 --> 00:49:30.830
adolescence about 10% of dreams
have explicit sexual content.

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:34.930
What's the most common dream?
Guesses.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:36.579
Falling.
That's a good guess.

00:49:36.579 --> 00:49:40.970
Falling is among the top dreams
but falling is not the winner.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:43.850
Somebody else.
Flying?

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:47.870
Also close.
Public speaking?

00:49:47.870 --> 00:49:56.110
Good phobic dream but not it.
Naked in public, not it.

00:49:56.110 --> 00:50:02.230
[laughter] Excellent.
Being chased.

00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:06.158
Evolutionary psychologists and
cognitive neuroscientists have

00:50:06.158 --> 00:50:10.198
puzzled over this one.
It seems to be sort of a primal

00:50:10.198 --> 00:50:14.340
dream but the dream about being
chased is a biggie.

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:17.197
Has anybody here ever dreamt of
being chased that you could

00:50:17.197 --> 00:50:18.550
remember?
Yeah.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:22.699
Being chased is the big one.
Naked in public?

00:50:22.699 --> 00:50:25.100
[laughter]
Grandmother killed by a monkey?

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:35.750
[laughter] No.
So, what are dreams for?

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:39.493
There are Freudian theories
that dreams are disguised with

00:50:39.493 --> 00:50:43.632
fulfillment and other things.
There is not much support for

00:50:43.632 --> 00:50:46.518
these.
One theory which is popular is

00:50:46.518 --> 00:50:51.275
that dreams are a side effect of
memory consolidation so your

00:50:51.275 --> 00:50:53.465
body,
sort of below the neck,

00:50:53.465 --> 00:50:57.389
rebuilds itself while you're
sleeping but also what happens

00:50:57.389 --> 00:51:01.244
while you're sleeping is your
memories get played over and

00:51:01.244 --> 00:51:05.100
over again to consolidate them
into different parts of the

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:07.751
brain.
Almost--the best analogy here

00:51:07.751 --> 00:51:11.219
is backing up a computer.
Your brain backs itself up.

00:51:11.219 --> 00:51:15.202
In the course of backing itself
up, there are sort of random

00:51:15.202 --> 00:51:18.847
events flash to consciousness
and get put together in a

00:51:18.847 --> 00:51:21.670
coherent story.
From this perspective,

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:25.170
dreams serve no adaptive
function at all but rather

00:51:25.170 --> 00:51:29.728
they're epiphenomena.
They are the byproducts of

00:51:29.728 --> 00:51:35.756
another system.
Final topic is laughter and

00:51:35.756 --> 00:51:41.753
this is a true mystery.
I got interested in this--well,

00:51:41.753 --> 00:51:45.681
I got interested in this as a
developmental psychologist

00:51:45.681 --> 00:51:50.109
watching my own children laugh
and trying to figure out what it

00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:54.777
is that made them laugh.
This is my son,

00:51:54.777 --> 00:52:00.839
Zachary, pretty young but
[laughter]

00:52:00.839 --> 00:52:08.980
this is not the youngest record
of laughing.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:10.400
I found this on the web.

00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:09.236
[laughter] It's a huge puzzle.
From an evolutionary point of

00:53:09.236 --> 00:53:14.530
view, people's pursuit of sex
and food and drink and sleep are

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:18.661
not these huge mysteries,
our abilities to understand

00:53:18.661 --> 00:53:22.189
language and make sense of the
visual world and cohere in

00:53:22.189 --> 00:53:25.990
groups,
but the fact that we make this

00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:31.484
weird noise at bizarre
circumstances is a huge puzzle

00:53:31.484 --> 00:53:36.768
and typical--typically
psychologists have failed to

00:53:36.768 --> 00:53:40.880
explain this puzzle.
So, here's something;

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:44.480
here's a first guess I read in
a neuroscience textbook.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.606
"We laugh when there is
incongruity between what we

00:53:47.606 --> 00:53:50.671
expect and what we
actually--what actually happens

00:53:50.671 --> 00:53:53.110
unless the outcome is
frightening."

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.599
[laughter]
Now, this is a fair effort.

00:53:55.599 --> 00:53:59.726
It is about as wrong as
anything can be wrong in any

00:53:59.726 --> 00:54:01.598
possible way.
[laughter]

00:54:01.598 --> 00:54:05.019
The first thing is it doesn't
really explain "why?"

00:54:05.019 --> 00:54:07.822
So, why should a
non-frightening incongruity

00:54:07.822 --> 00:54:11.342
cause people to make a
distinctive loud noise consisted

00:54:11.342 --> 00:54:14.797
of staccato segments of one
fifteenth of a second each

00:54:14.797 --> 00:54:17.340
separated by a fifth of a
second?

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.932
It doesn't explain why we make
that loud noise when dealing

00:54:20.932 --> 00:54:24.534
with incongruity.
It's not the case that

00:54:24.534 --> 00:54:30.019
incongruity causes laughter.
If there was a bowl of fruit up

00:54:30.019 --> 00:54:33.934
there as you walked in,
it'd be incongruous but people

00:54:33.934 --> 00:54:38.070
wouldn't shriek with laughter
and point to the fruit.

00:54:38.070 --> 00:54:41.661
[laughter]
It's also--a lot of laughter

00:54:41.661 --> 00:54:47.143
isn't caused by incongruity so a
lot of times when we laugh

00:54:47.143 --> 00:54:52.719
there's nothing incongruous in
any deep sense about it.

00:54:52.719 --> 00:54:54.760
So, laughter is kind of a
puzzle.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:58.855
We don't know why we laugh.
We don't know what makes us

00:54:58.855 --> 00:55:00.927
laugh.
Over the last five,

00:55:00.927 --> 00:55:04.409
ten years there's been some
work done on this.

00:55:04.409 --> 00:55:08.815
A lot of the work is done by
Robert Provine who summarizes

00:55:08.815 --> 00:55:12.988
this in his excellent book
Laughter. And Provine

00:55:12.988 --> 00:55:17.316
decided to do something that
nobody in the history of the

00:55:17.316 --> 00:55:21.403
world has done.
He decided to send himself and

00:55:21.403 --> 00:55:26.329
his students to different places
including shopping malls and

00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:31.829
observe when people laughed and
write down what made them laugh.

00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:35.232
And this is the first
descriptive step to developing a

00:55:35.232 --> 00:55:39.571
theory of laughter.
And his big finding is that you

00:55:39.571 --> 00:55:44.976
could separate people--you could
separate the question of

00:55:44.976 --> 00:55:51.250
laughter from the question of a
joke or the question of humor.

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:56.553
Most of what people--what made
people laugh wasn't in any sense

00:55:56.553 --> 00:56:00.409
a joke or humorous.
So, he had over a thousand

00:56:00.409 --> 00:56:04.687
laughter-initiated situations
and here are some typical

00:56:04.687 --> 00:56:07.539
comments that initiated
laughter,

00:56:07.539 --> 00:56:11.080
sometimes uproarious laughter,
on the parts of people.

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.890
"I'll see you guys later."
"Look.

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:18.320
It's Andre."
[laughter] "Are you sure?"

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:20.640
"I know."
"How are you?"

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:25.150
"I try to lead a normal life."
It's sort of funny.

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:27.333
[laughter]
It was anyway in a context

00:56:27.333 --> 00:56:29.700
where it wasn't particularly
amusing.

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:33.809
"It wasn't you."
"We can handle this."

00:56:33.809 --> 00:56:37.214
Only ten percent of the
comments were--could be re-coded

00:56:37.214 --> 00:56:40.679
later on as people--as actually
humorous in any sense.

00:56:40.679 --> 00:56:43.974
And these included "Poor boy
looks just like his father,"

00:56:43.974 --> 00:56:46.210
[laughter]
"You smell like you've had a

00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.806
good workout,"
[laughter]

00:56:47.806 --> 00:56:50.168
"Did you find that in your
nose?", [laughter]

00:56:50.168 --> 00:56:53.678
a reference to dormitory food,
[laughter], "He has a job

00:56:53.678 --> 00:56:56.599
pulling back skin in the
operating room."

00:56:56.599 --> 00:56:59.537
[laughter]
So, Provine suggests we

00:56:59.537 --> 00:57:04.434
separate the question of
laughter and jokes and then ask

00:57:04.434 --> 00:57:09.446
what do we know about laughter?
Well, here are some basic facts

00:57:09.446 --> 00:57:12.687
that--remember we're trying to
think like evolutionary

00:57:12.687 --> 00:57:15.606
biologists here.
Humans have this universal

00:57:15.606 --> 00:57:17.206
trait.
There's no society without

00:57:17.206 --> 00:57:19.412
laughter.
It's early emerging as we saw

00:57:19.412 --> 00:57:22.120
in those clips.
So, what's it for?

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.032
What does it do?
If it's an accident,

00:57:24.032 --> 00:57:27.900
what's it an accident from?
What properties does it have?

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.400
And there are some properties
that are important to know.

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:34.350
It's social and communicative.
Why do we know that?

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:40.070
Because it's loud.
Laughter is not like hunger.

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:43.259
Hunger can be silent.
Hunger is not essentially a

00:57:43.259 --> 00:57:46.693
message to other people but when
humans – when it involves a

00:57:46.693 --> 00:57:50.070
loud noise – the reason why
we've evolved loud noises is to

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:55.021
communicate with other people.
Laughter could be viewed as a

00:57:55.021 --> 00:58:00.469
form of involuntary noisemaking
and it's contagious.

00:58:00.469 --> 00:58:03.130
That's another interesting
thing about it.

00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:08.681
One of the great discoveries in
television and movies was the

00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:13.206
invention of the laugh track.
The laugh track makes things a

00:58:13.206 --> 00:58:16.407
lot funnier because people laugh
a lot more when they're in

00:58:16.407 --> 00:58:18.879
groups.
The rim shot after a comic

00:58:18.879 --> 00:58:21.979
remark is an attempt to
simulate--sort of a

00:58:21.979 --> 00:58:26.630
pre-technological attempt to
simulate the sound of laughter.

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:31.524
Children are particularly
influenced by the contagiousness

00:58:31.524 --> 00:58:34.530
of laughter, but just in
general,

00:58:34.530 --> 00:58:38.957
if you hear somebody laughing,
like the kids you saw before,

00:58:38.957 --> 00:58:43.309
it's the sort of thing that
could easily make you laugh.

00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:47.640
Other primates do it to some
extent and then it's interesting

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:53.269
when they do it.
Monkeys laugh when they attack.

00:58:53.269 --> 00:58:58.024
When monkeys get together to
kill and eat somebody they make

00:58:58.024 --> 00:59:02.617
a kind of a laughing noise and
chimpanzees laugh when they

00:59:02.617 --> 00:59:06.854
tickle each other.
And then you'll see--And what's

00:59:06.854 --> 00:59:09.385
tickling?
Well, a fair definition of

00:59:09.385 --> 00:59:13.190
tickling is touching parts of
the body in a mock attack.

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:16.250
You sort of attack somebody and
they're laughing but if

00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:19.423
it's--but if somebody's trying
to mug you you're not "Ah,

00:59:19.423 --> 00:59:21.314
this is so funny."
[laughter]

00:59:21.314 --> 00:59:24.410
You have to realize that this
is a mock attack;

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:29.168
you're simulating attack.
So one theory is--is a signal

00:59:29.168 --> 00:59:32.750
of mock aggression and
collective aggression.

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:37.242
It's basically--it's like a
sound of some sort of mob

00:59:37.242 --> 00:59:40.231
attack.
It's mock aggression in the

00:59:40.231 --> 00:59:44.325
sense that when people laugh
they're often teasing,

00:59:44.325 --> 00:59:47.902
kidding around.
They're throwing out insults,

00:59:47.902 --> 00:59:52.107
maybe they're tickling each
other, maybe they're making fun

00:59:52.107 --> 00:59:54.755
of each other,
maybe they're making fun of

00:59:54.755 --> 00:59:57.219
themselves, and there's some
aggression to it.

00:59:57.219 --> 01:00:01.528
Most laughter is inspired by
some degree of aggression,

01:00:01.528 --> 01:00:04.719
but it's attenuated and it's
not real.

01:00:04.719 --> 01:00:07.489
And the laughter is a signal
this isn't real.

01:00:07.489 --> 01:00:11.636
And collective aggression--a
lot of mob assaults,

01:00:11.636 --> 01:00:16.129
executions, lynchings,
rapes are accompanied with the

01:00:16.129 --> 01:00:19.586
sound of laughter.
When you're in a group doing

01:00:19.586 --> 01:00:22.921
something terribly aggressive
and you are not--you don't feel

01:00:22.921 --> 01:00:26.200
like you're at risk you might
laugh and laughter is a signal

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.480
to other members of your group
as a signal of solidarity and

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.160
what you're doing together.
A different way of putting

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:36.811
it--and none of this is going to
come in with a sharp,

01:00:36.811 --> 01:00:40.144
decisive theory.
These are sort of flailing away

01:00:40.144 --> 01:00:43.998
at different ideas but another
way of doing--an older way is

01:00:43.998 --> 01:00:47.617
proposed by Plato,
who viewed laughter as a form

01:00:47.617 --> 01:00:50.329
of bonding against a common
enemy.

01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:54.730
It's a sound of group cohesion
against the common enemy.

01:00:54.730 --> 01:00:59.850
Comedians have not missed the
aggressive nature of laughter.

01:00:59.850 --> 01:01:03.457
Dave Barry writes: 
The most important humor

01:01:03.457 --> 01:01:06.531
truth of all is that to really
see the humor in a situation you

01:01:06.531 --> 01:01:09.440
have to have perspective.
Perspective is derived from two

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:11.892
ancient Greek words,
‘pers' meaning something bad

01:01:11.892 --> 01:01:14.736
that happens to someone else and
‘ective' meaning ideally

01:01:14.736 --> 01:01:16.599
somebody like Donald
Trump.

01:01:16.599 --> 01:01:19.280
[laughter]
And the idea is that it's

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:24.260
something bad happening but not
to you or to somebody you love.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:27.029
Mel Brooks puts it in somewhat
sharper terms,

01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:30.806
distinguishing between comedy
and tragedy: "Tragedy is when I

01:01:30.806 --> 01:01:33.233
cut my finger.
Comedy is when you fall in an

01:01:33.233 --> 01:01:34.170
open sewer and die."

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:43.645
[laughter]
To sum up, ingredients of humor

01:01:43.645 --> 01:01:48.050
is there has to be a target who
experiences some harm.

01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:50.200
It could be an enemy.
It could be a friend.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.835
It could be yourself.
The harm shouldn't be so

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:58.656
serious that it elicits strong
negative emotions like fear,

01:01:58.656 --> 01:02:02.305
grief or pity.
So, if a stranger slips on a

01:02:02.305 --> 01:02:07.015
banana peel and lands on his
butt, I might laugh because I'm

01:02:07.015 --> 01:02:11.111
not overcome by compassion.
If he splits his head open and

01:02:11.111 --> 01:02:14.288
there's blood everywhere,
I'm less likely to laugh unless

01:02:14.288 --> 01:02:16.891
I don't like him or something.
[laughter]

01:02:16.891 --> 01:02:21.208
And this is why the humor--why
the damage is often a certain

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:25.159
sort of damage involving things
like embarrassment,

01:02:25.159 --> 01:02:26.691
sex, scatology,
a banana peel,

01:02:26.691 --> 01:02:28.750
pie in the face,
your pants fall down or

01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:31.639
something,
where there's no real harm.

01:02:31.639 --> 01:02:35.418
So, empathy,
caring, sympathy don't kick in,

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:40.250
but instead there's the
aggression unleashed at somebody

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:44.380
and there has to be some level
of surprise.

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:49.197
This is what--this is where the
humor for that baby comes in,

01:02:49.197 --> 01:02:53.854
which is you couldn't predict
when the sound was coming and

01:02:53.854 --> 01:02:58.270
some aspect of that was what
made it so funny then,

01:02:58.270 --> 01:03:01.746
what elicited the laughter.
This is--what elicited the

01:03:01.746 --> 01:03:05.206
laughter for Zachary was
watching the classic film

01:03:05.206 --> 01:03:09.232
Winnie the Pooh and the
Blustery Day where Rabbit

01:03:09.232 --> 01:03:13.328
climbed on a high bunch of
shelves and it all came crashing

01:03:13.328 --> 01:03:16.210
down on him.
But he didn't--he wasn't dead.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:20.502
He was just kind of stunned.
[laughter]

01:03:20.502 --> 01:03:23.220
Final question for anybody
interested in laughter is,

01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:25.050
"Why can't we tickle
ourselves?"

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:28.556
Now, I've talked about laughter
on two separate occasions and on

01:03:28.556 --> 01:03:31.896
each of the occasions when I
talked in front of a large group

01:03:31.896 --> 01:03:35.070
like this somebody came up to me
afterwards and said,

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:39.445
"But I can."
[laughter]

01:03:39.445 --> 01:03:42.771
And [laughter]
I don't--and they seemed

01:03:42.771 --> 01:03:47.830
sincere but if people say,
"I can tickle myself," how many

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:52.710
people here will own up to being
able to tickle themselves?

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:55.944
One?
[laughter]

01:03:55.944 --> 01:04:00.079
It's a fascinating question why
some people can.

01:04:00.079 --> 01:04:03.547
The general story of why we
can't in general is because

01:04:03.547 --> 01:04:06.733
there's no surprise,
there's no mock aggression,

01:04:06.733 --> 01:04:10.869
and also there may be a general
deadening of self-stimulation.

01:04:10.869 --> 01:04:18.340
I'm going to end with the final
reading response.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:22.378
Think of an interesting
testable idea about either

01:04:22.378 --> 01:04:25.576
dreams or laughter.
You could go into as much

01:04:25.576 --> 01:04:29.089
detail as you want.
If you want your thing could be

01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:32.260
one sentence long but it could
be longer.

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:37.748
I will ask the teaching fellows
to each send me their one or two

01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:42.400
most interesting remarks.
I will then judge and then the

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.849
winner will win some small
prize, either of a literary or a

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:50.010
food nature.
Okay.

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:52.076
I'll see you all on Wednesday.

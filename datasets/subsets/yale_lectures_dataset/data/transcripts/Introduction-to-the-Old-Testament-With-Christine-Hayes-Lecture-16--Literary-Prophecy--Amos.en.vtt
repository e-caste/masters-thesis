00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.007
Professor Christine
Hayes: Let me just briefly

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:04.936
recap as we are moving into the
literary prophets,

00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:07.180
or the classical prophets,
they are sometimes called.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.830
It is easiest to think of them
as being associated with

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.990
particular crises in the
nation's history.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.052
We are not going to be looking
at them all, and I have picked

00:00:15.052 --> 00:00:17.860
out some of the main ones that
we will be looking at.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.000
Really, they are exemplary in a
number of different ways.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.080
So you have prophets of the
Assyrian crisis.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.860
This is when the two kingdoms
still exist.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.240
In the north prophesying in
Israel, you have Amos and Hosea.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.760
And in the south you have
Isaiah and Micah.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.119
So think of those four books
together.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.179
It will be easier to note the
differences among them if you

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:34.960
group them together.
 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.070
And we will be doing that.
 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.770
Then the prophets of the
Babylonian crisis.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.790
By this time the northern
kingdom has fallen.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.090
We are moving towards the end
of the seventh century.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.710
The Assyrian Empire has fallen
in 612.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.600
The prophet Nahum talks about
the fall of Assyria.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.600
And we move then into the very
end of the century and down to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.500
the beginning of the sixth
century, with the destruction of

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.893
Judah.
So prophets associated with

00:00:55.893 --> 00:00:59.610
that time: particularly
Jeremiah, and also Habakkuk.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.810
Then we have the prophet of the
exile, who is Ezekiel.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.719
And then the post-exilic
period, or the Restoration,

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:09.198
when the Israelites are allowed
to return to their land and we

00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:11.879
have several prophets at that
time: Haggai,

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:15.574
Zechariah, Joel and Malachi
will be the prophets we'll be

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:16.959
looking at briefly.
 

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.445
There are three long prophetic
works, and I have circled those

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:23.988
: Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel,
one associated with each of the

00:01:23.988 --> 00:01:26.836
three crises.
So again another mnemonic for

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:30.524
you is to think of them each
associated with each of those

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:33.051
major crises.
And the rest are all much

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:35.377
shorter works,
I think Obadiah being the

00:01:35.377 --> 00:01:38.300
shortest, really just a very,
very short work.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.791
There has been a long debate
over the degree to which these

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:47.050
classical or literary prophets
were harking back to long

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.774
standing Israelite traditions or
constructing norms that would

00:01:51.774 --> 00:01:57.040
later come to be viewed as long
standing Israelite traditions.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.336
Kaufman describes these
classical prophets as the

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:02.740
standard bearers of the
covenant.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.150
This is his term.
 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.966
And in his view they could be
seen as conservatives,

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:12.306
but by the same token he says
the new prophecy conceived of

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:16.422
ideas that Israelite thought of
the earlier time had not

00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:18.606
conceived.
And in this sense,

00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:20.689
Kaufman argues they are also
radical.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.808
He describes them as radical
conservatives or conservative

00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:25.778
radicals.
As a result of the radical

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.042
nature of some of their message,
the prophets had to speak with

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:30.199
great exaggeration.
 

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:32.509
And you will notice this when
you read their writing.

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.424
Great exaggeration,
a lot of dramatic imagery,

00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:36.720
dramatic features.
 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.860
They denounce the people.
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.199
They chastise the people.
 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:43.435
And as a result they were often
scoffed at or even persecuted in

00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:46.216
return.
But eventually the nation would

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:50.500
come to enshrine their words in
its ancient sacred heritage,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.679
which is testimony to the fact
that their message must have

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.914
served a crucial role at some
time in the changing political

00:02:56.914 --> 00:02:58.340
and religious reality.
 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.009
Now, we have already talked
about the Deuteronomistic

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:04.832
historiosophy,
and how it developed as an

00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:09.419
interpretation of the historical
catastrophes of 722 and 586,

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:12.565
and this interpretation made it
possible for Israelites to

00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:15.270
accept the reality of the defeat
of the nation,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.809
the defeat of Israel,
without at the same time losing

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.234
faith in God.
The defeat of Israel,

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:24.912
the exile of the nation,
was not to be taken as evidence

00:03:24.912 --> 00:03:28.389
that God was not the one supreme
Lord of history,

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.657
or that God was a faithless
God, who would abandon his

00:03:31.657 --> 00:03:33.259
covenant and his people.
 

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.988
The defeat and the exile were
interpreted to affirm precisely

00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:39.867
the opposite.
God, as the universal God,

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:42.639
could use other nations as his
tool.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.396
He could use these nations to
execute judgment on his people,

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:49.840
and he did this in an act of
faithfulness ultimately,

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.272
faithful to his covenant,
which promised punishment and

00:03:53.272 --> 00:03:57.340
chastisement for the sins of the
people, the sins of idolatry.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.083
The classical literary
prophets, Isaiah,

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:03.108
Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the 12
minor prophets,

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:07.400
follow the basic thrust of this
interpretation of events.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.474
They agree that the defeat and
the exile are evidence rather

00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:14.719
than disproof of God's universal
sovereignty,

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:18.769
and they agree that they are
God's just punishment for sin.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.972
But they are going to differ
from the Deuteronomist in two

00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:23.040
significant ways.
 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.018
First they are going to differ
in their identification of that

00:04:27.018 --> 00:04:28.353
sin.
For the prophets,

00:04:28.353 --> 00:04:31.238
it is not just idolatry for
which Israel is punished,

00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:33.180
although that is important,
too.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.369
And second of all,
they are going to differ in

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.850
their emphasis on a future
restoration and glory,

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.007
a message that we do not find
in the Deuteronomistic

00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:43.420
historian.
The individual books of the

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.884
prophets are really arranged
according to two interacting

00:04:46.884 --> 00:04:49.050
principles: size and chronology.
 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.928
So you have the first three
books, are the very large,

00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:53.339
prophetic books:
Isaiah,

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:57.028
Jeremiah, and Ezekiel in
chronological order of the three

00:04:57.028 --> 00:04:59.069
crises we have outlined here.
 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.906
And then you have the minor
prophets, and the minor

00:05:01.906 --> 00:05:04.232
prophets, again,
are roughly chronological

00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:06.230
order,
although book size also plays a

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.259
bit of a role in arranging these
materials.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.678
That was very common in the
ancient world--for size to

00:05:10.678 --> 00:05:12.639
determine the order of books in
a corpus.

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.705
We are not going to be
following the order of the

00:05:15.705 --> 00:05:19.089
canon, because it does jump
around chronologically;

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.944
first with the three large
books and then going back and

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:24.800
having some of the smaller books
of earlier prophets.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.899
We are going to be looking at
them in chronological order.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:30.434
We are going to be looking at
them against the backdrop of the

00:05:30.434 --> 00:05:32.470
historical crisis to which they
are responding.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.189
So we are going to begin with
the first of the literary

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:38.210
prophets, even though it is not
the first in the order of the

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.620
Bible, and that is Amos.
 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.629
Amos preached during a
relatively stable period of

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:43.983
time.
This was in the northern

00:05:43.983 --> 00:05:46.133
kingdom.
It was around 750 under the

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:49.139
reign of Jeroboam the Second,
not the first.

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.254
And this is at a time before
the Assyrian threat is becoming

00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:56.254
very apparent,
and Assyria's empire building

00:05:56.254 --> 00:06:00.089
ambitions--before those are
becoming very apparent.

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.076
There are many passages that
suggest that Amos was an

00:06:04.076 --> 00:06:05.610
ordinary shepherd.
 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.029
He came from a small town about
10 miles south of Jerusalem;

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.670
so he came from the southern
kingdom to prophesy in the

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.600
northern kingdom.
 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.608
He was called to Bethel,
which was one of the royal

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:18.617
sanctuaries in the northern
kingdom, to deliver his

00:06:18.617 --> 00:06:21.164
prophecies.
But despite the suggestion that

00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:24.295
he was an ordinary shepherd it
seems more likely that he was

00:06:24.295 --> 00:06:27.160
probably a fairly wealthy owner
of land and flocks.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.519
He was probably educated and
literate.

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:34.259
The northerners are said to be
very surprised by his eloquence

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:35.670
and his intelligence.
 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.281
But they did not like his
message, and ultimately he is

00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:40.990
going to be forced to go back to
the southern kingdom.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.915
The Book of Amos can be divided
structurally into four sections,

00:06:44.915 --> 00:06:47.720
which I have listed on the
board over here.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.870
You first have a set of brief
oracles of doom.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.269
These are in the first two
chapters, Amos 1 and 2.

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:56.233
And then you have a series of
three short oracles,

00:06:56.233 --> 00:06:58.290
oracles to the women of
Samaria,

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.165
an oracle to the wealthy of
Samaria and Jerusalem,

00:07:01.165 --> 00:07:03.630
and then an oracle to Israel as
a whole.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.800
These are in chapters 3-6.
 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.450
This is followed then by five
symbolic visions which receive

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.171
interpretation.
These are visions of judgment,

00:07:14.171 --> 00:07:16.235
first locusts,
then a fire,

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:20.839
then a plumb line that one uses
in building a building,

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:24.194
a basket of fruit,
and then a vision of God

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:26.910
standing by the altar at Bethel.
 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:33.410
This happens chapters 7-9,
about verse 8 and 9 .

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.970
This section,
besides the five visions,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.945
also has a little narrative
account of Amos' conflict with a

00:07:39.945 --> 00:07:44.066
priest at Bethel,
the priest Amaziah who accuses

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:47.504
Amos of treason.
And then there is a concluding

00:07:47.504 --> 00:07:51.123
epilogue in the ninth chapter
that runs for about seven or

00:07:51.123 --> 00:07:53.600
eight verses to the end of the
book.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.838
The Book of Amos is a wonderful
place to start for us because it

00:07:56.838 --> 00:07:59.922
contains many features that are
going to be typical of all of

00:07:59.922 --> 00:08:02.955
the classical prophets,
all of the literary prophets by

00:08:02.955 --> 00:08:05.279
and large.
And also this book introduces

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.600
certain major themes.
 

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.519
These will become standard
themes of prophecy with some

00:08:09.519 --> 00:08:10.980
variation here and there.
 

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.673
So by setting them out in the
Book of Amos then we can really

00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:16.276
go forward and just look at the
variations on some of those

00:08:16.276 --> 00:08:18.879
themes that are sounded by some
of the other prophets.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:21.466
So first some literary
features, and then we will talk

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:22.980
about the themes of the book.
 

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.750
In terms of literary features,
I have jotted down a few here.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:28.160
You see in the book what we
would call editorial notes.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.930
That is to say,
you have notes in the Book of

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:33.259
Amos which are in the third
person.

00:08:33.259 --> 00:08:35.769
These will very often occur at
the beginning of a book.

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:37.800
They sort of introduce or set
the stage.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.139
So we have in Amos.
 

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:41.775
"The words of Amos,
a sheep breeder from Tekoa,

00:08:41.775 --> 00:08:44.869
who prophesied concerning
Israel in the reigns of kings

00:08:44.869 --> 00:08:48.371
Uzziah of Judah and Jeroboam,
the son of Joash of Israel,

00:08:48.371 --> 00:08:50.399
two years before the
earthquake."

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:53.587
So almost all of the prophetic
books are going to contain an

00:08:53.587 --> 00:08:55.100
introduction of this type.
 

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.885
Some third-person phrase which
will identify the place and the

00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:01.690
prophet and his time.
 

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.655
There is another kind of
writing in some of these works,

00:09:05.655 --> 00:09:08.539
as well, which is in the first
person.

00:09:08.539 --> 00:09:11.930
It is not always in the third
person, but you sometimes have

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.378
first person passages in which
the prophet himself will speak

00:09:15.378 --> 00:09:18.080
about and describe something
about himself.

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.451
It's a stepping aside from the
oracular moment and speaking in

00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:24.159
some way about some experience
that he has had.

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:27.205
So we have these first person
and these third person passages

00:09:27.205 --> 00:09:29.490
that give us information about
the prophet.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.167
The third-person passages,
we surmise, may have been

00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:35.389
written by the prophet,
but they were probably written

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:39.273
by disciples or others who were
responsible for collecting the

00:09:39.273 --> 00:09:43.080
prophets' oracles,
inditing the prophet's oracles.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.659
Amos 7 is an example of this.
 

00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:50.003
In Amos 7, we find an example
of this kind of writing,

00:09:50.003 --> 00:09:53.284
again, where you have a
description of Amos in debate

00:09:53.284 --> 00:09:55.575
with a priest,
Priest Amaziah,

00:09:55.575 --> 00:09:57.500
at the Shrine of Bethel.
 

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.819
So you have the oracular
statements, but you also have

00:10:00.819 --> 00:10:04.325
these other identifying passages
as well, and descriptive

00:10:04.325 --> 00:10:07.100
passages.
This brings us then to a second

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.946
point, which is that the
prophetic books are a

00:10:09.946 --> 00:10:12.539
compilation of a variety of
materials.

00:10:12.539 --> 00:10:15.093
They consist of varied
materials that have been

00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:16.710
collected.
They have been revised.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.559
They have been supplemented.
 

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:21.577
The prophets' oracles,
which were delivered in various

00:10:21.577 --> 00:10:23.570
situations over a period of
time,

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:27.623
were apparently saved and then
compiled, again perhaps by the

00:10:27.623 --> 00:10:31.000
prophet himself,
perhaps by his disciples.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.826
We know that prophetic oracles
were written down and

00:10:33.826 --> 00:10:36.820
transmitted in other ancient
Near Eastern societies.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.330
We know this about Assyria,
for example.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.658
These were literary
compositions and the literary

00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:46.818
nature of these compositions
will account sometimes for their

00:10:46.818 --> 00:10:49.210
ordering.
Sometimes it appears that there

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:50.700
is not chronological ordering.
 

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.028
This is one of the things that
can make it so hard to read some

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.764
of the prophetic writings,
because the oracles are not

00:10:55.764 --> 00:10:58.009
necessarily in chronological
order.

00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:01.485
They are literary works,
and sometimes the prophet or

00:11:01.485 --> 00:11:05.830
the disciple or the editor would
combine principles--I'm sorry,

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:09.364
combine oracles or juxtapose
oracles according to principles

00:11:09.364 --> 00:11:12.059
other than chronology--literary
principles.

00:11:12.059 --> 00:11:14.458
So for example,
you very often find the

00:11:14.458 --> 00:11:18.056
principle of a catch word:
a prophecy or oracle that might

00:11:18.056 --> 00:11:21.970
end with a particular word in
its last line or last verse,

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:25.115
and so next to it will be a
second prophecy or oracle which

00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:27.230
echoes that word in its opening
line,

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.686
and so the two have been
brought together for literary

00:11:29.686 --> 00:11:31.193
reasons.
So Amos 3:2,

00:11:31.193 --> 00:11:36.060
reads: "You alone have I known
of all the families of the

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.864
earth."
And that is the concluding line

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:42.109
of that particular oracle,
and that verb "to know" is

00:11:42.109 --> 00:11:45.480
probably the catchword for the
oracle that follows,

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.980
because the next one opens,
"Do two people walk together

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:49.389
unless they know each other?"
 

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:52.580
So that may have suggested the
juxtaposition of those two.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.490
So we need to understand that
the prophetic books are really

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.710
little anthologies,
anthologies of oracles.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.831
They can be connected for
literary rather than substantive

00:12:00.831 --> 00:12:02.309
or chronological reasons.
 

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:04.330
You can't assume chronological
sequence.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.331
It is not like reading the
historical books of Joshua

00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:10.509
through 2 Kings.
It is very, very different.

00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:14.839
An interesting question
concerns the degree to which the

00:12:14.839 --> 00:12:19.720
prophetic books preserve the
actual oracles of the prophets.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.165
Certainly there is no doubt
that there has been revision and

00:12:23.165 --> 00:12:25.559
supplementation of the prophetic
books.

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:28.957
Not everything in the Book of
Amos is from Amos,

00:12:28.957 --> 00:12:31.097
himself.
Additions have been made to

00:12:31.097 --> 00:12:32.620
most of the prophetic books.
 

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.386
It was believed that the words
of the prophets had enduring

00:12:36.386 --> 00:12:38.717
significance.
Those who received these words

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:40.799
believed that they had enduring
significance.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:44.061
And so they were supplemented
because of the conviction that

00:12:44.061 --> 00:12:46.604
they had enduring relevance,
not despite of it,

00:12:46.604 --> 00:12:49.691
because of it.
And some scholars believe that

00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:54.013
this accounts for the oracle in
Amos 2 that prophesies the fall

00:12:54.013 --> 00:12:55.810
of Judah.
Amos is living in 750,

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:58.169
the latter half of the eighth
century, not in the sixth

00:12:58.169 --> 00:12:59.942
century.
He is living in the eighth

00:12:59.942 --> 00:13:02.057
century.
But he prophesies the fall of

00:13:02.057 --> 00:13:05.450
Judah, and most people would
assume that this is an addition

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.669
which is made to the Book of
Amos after Judah's fall.

00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:11.894
These supplementations and
additions and revisions that we

00:13:11.894 --> 00:13:14.269
will see in some of the
prophetic books,

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:17.716
and some of them are quite
obvious, were not completely

00:13:17.716 --> 00:13:20.118
promiscuous.
I don't want to give you the

00:13:20.118 --> 00:13:22.382
idea that they were,
because there are many

00:13:22.382 --> 00:13:25.399
instances in which a prophet's
words are not updated,

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:28.655
are not modified,
even though the failure to do

00:13:28.655 --> 00:13:32.476
this leaves the prophecy
woefully out of step with what

00:13:32.476 --> 00:13:34.600
actually came to be later.
 

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.917
So those kinds of
inconsistencies between a

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:40.227
prophet's words and later fact
would suggest that there was a

00:13:40.227 --> 00:13:43.980
strong tendency to preserve the
words of the prophet faithfully.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.759
So we will see both tendencies
within the literature,

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:48.629
a tendency to leave words
intact,

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:51.458
and at the same place,
a tendency to supplement or to

00:13:51.458 --> 00:13:54.879
add sections to the prophet,
the prophetic writing.

00:13:54.879 --> 00:13:58.055
A third feature that we will
see in many of the prophetic

00:13:58.055 --> 00:14:00.039
books is what we call "the
call."

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:02.559
And this is common to most of
the prophets.

00:14:02.559 --> 00:14:07.006
It is the claim to authority as
a result of having been called

00:14:07.006 --> 00:14:09.120
by God to deliver his word.
 

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.956
We talked before about
apostolic prophecy,

00:14:10.956 --> 00:14:13.643
this notion of the prophet as
someone who is sent by God with

00:14:13.643 --> 00:14:16.094
a message,
not someone who is consulted by

00:14:16.094 --> 00:14:18.330
a client to find out what God
thinks.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.272
The irresistibility of the call
is a feature of these passages,

00:14:23.272 --> 00:14:26.700
and we find it illustrated in
Amos 3:7-8,

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.312
after citing a series of
proverbs that illustrate

00:14:30.312 --> 00:14:32.570
inexorable cause and effect.
 

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.951
For example,
he says, "Does a trap spring up

00:14:34.951 --> 00:14:37.720
from the ground/Unless it has
caught something?"

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.395
And then the oracle continues,
"A lion has roared,/Who can but

00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:44.650
fear?/My Lord God has
spoken,/Who can but prophesy?"

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.690
There is this irresistible call.
 

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.486
We find metaphors used
liberally throughout the

00:14:51.486 --> 00:14:53.220
prophetic writings.
 

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.207
And Amos describes his prophecy
by means of two types of

00:14:57.207 --> 00:14:59.309
metaphors, word and vision.
 

00:14:59.309 --> 00:15:03.485
So many of the prophetic
oracles will be introduced by

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:07.740
the phrase "the word of Yahweh
came unto prophet X."

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.659
The word of Yahweh came--sort
of an image of God speaking

00:15:10.659 --> 00:15:13.110
directly to these prophets in
human language,

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.687
which is then repeated or
passed on to the audience,

00:15:16.687 --> 00:15:20.032
to the listener.
This could be understood in a

00:15:20.032 --> 00:15:22.524
literal sense.
We could take this as a

00:15:22.524 --> 00:15:23.986
metaphor.
Behind it, however,

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:26.658
is the simple idea that it is
God who is communicating to the

00:15:26.658 --> 00:15:29.285
prophet and the prophet then
communicates the message to the

00:15:29.285 --> 00:15:31.169
people.
But in addition to hearing,

00:15:31.169 --> 00:15:33.470
Amos and many of the other
prophets also see.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.524
So the word of the Lord comes,
but in other moments the

00:15:36.524 --> 00:15:39.466
prophetic oracle will be
introduced by verbs or words

00:15:39.466 --> 00:15:41.559
connected with seeing and
vision.

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:45.450
Hence the word "seer" as a
designation for a prophet also.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.329
Amos is shown visions of
various kinds,

00:15:48.329 --> 00:15:53.179
particularly those five visions
clumped in chapters 7,8 and 9.

00:15:53.179 --> 00:15:56.279
And this is true of the
prophets generally.

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:59.096
These visions might be visions
of God speaking,

00:15:59.096 --> 00:16:02.220
or visions of God performing
some kind of action.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.480
They might also be visions of
perfectly ordinary objects or

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.519
events that carry some sort of
symbolic significance.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:13.392
So we have five visions in Amos
in chapters 7-9,

00:16:13.392 --> 00:16:16.509
and some of them are visions of
ordinary objects,

00:16:16.509 --> 00:16:19.451
but those objects have some
special coded meaning or

00:16:19.451 --> 00:16:21.470
symbolic significance for
Israel.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.712
And then we have visions of
extraordinary things,

00:16:23.712 --> 00:16:25.679
as well.
So we have a locust plague.

00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:29.924
It is about to consume the crop
right after the king has taken

00:16:29.924 --> 00:16:32.360
his share, his taxes of the
crop.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.472
Not such an extraordinary
vision, but then there is a

00:16:35.472 --> 00:16:38.764
vision of a fire that consumes
the lower waters that are

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:42.000
pressed down below the earth,
and which threatens to consume

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.470
even the soil of the earth
itself.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.549
So it is an extraordinary
vision.

00:16:45.549 --> 00:16:48.895
We have a vision of a plumb
line-- the tool that is used by

00:16:48.895 --> 00:16:51.390
builders.
There is a vision of God

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:54.259
destroying worshipers in the
temple.

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:57.389
The vision in chapter 8 is an
ordinary vision.

00:16:57.389 --> 00:17:00.450
It is a vision of a basket of
summer fruit.

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.633
The Hebrew word for summer or
summer fruit is kayits

00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:08.890
and this is a pun because the
word kets means end.

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.433
So the vision of kayits
is indicating or symbolizing the

00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:14.319
kets, the end of Israel.
 

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:18.212
And these kinds of symbolic
visions will very often

00:17:18.212 --> 00:17:21.170
typically include puns of this
type.

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.200
So another point to make about
just the literary features of

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.367
prophetic writings is that they
do contain or employ a variety

00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:30.869
of literary forms.
 

00:17:30.869 --> 00:17:34.474
One commonplace form that you
will see over and over again in

00:17:34.474 --> 00:17:37.357
these writings is a form that we
call the oracle,

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:39.400
an oracle against the nations.
 

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.970
This is found in Amos.
 

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.967
It's found also in the three
large prophetic writings:

00:17:43.967 --> 00:17:45.720
Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.
 

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.654
Amos 1 and 2 contains seven of
these oracles that inveigh

00:17:49.654 --> 00:17:51.200
against the nations.
 

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.030
But Amos gives the form a new
twist.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.940
And this is what's interesting.
 

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.114
Six of the seven oracles are
directed against surrounding

00:17:58.114 --> 00:18:01.686
nations, and they are excoriated
for their inhumane treatment of

00:18:01.686 --> 00:18:04.704
others,
Israelites and non-Israelites

00:18:04.704 --> 00:18:08.750
during wars and conflicts,
as punishment for their

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.980
terrible war atrocities.
 

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.670
A divine fire is going to break
out and destroy all of their

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.609
palaces and fortified places.
 

00:18:16.609 --> 00:18:20.066
But then the twist comes,
because after these six

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:23.377
horrific oracles,
which condemn the nations for

00:18:23.377 --> 00:18:26.329
these brutal acts of atrocity in
war,

00:18:26.329 --> 00:18:29.400
Amos then turns to address his
own people.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.850
And he says the same divine
power will consume the people of

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.241
Yahweh because of the atrocities
and inhumanities that they

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.230
commit even in times of peace!
 

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.509
So the seventh,
the climactic oracle,

00:18:40.509 --> 00:18:43.866
announces that God's wrath will
be directed at Israel,

00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:47.349
and this is a very unwelcome,
unexpected statement.

00:18:47.349 --> 00:18:50.814
And you can see how he perhaps
would almost draw his audience

00:18:50.814 --> 00:18:53.065
in, you know,
with these images of their

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.259
enemies getting what they
deserve,

00:18:55.259 --> 00:18:57.767
only to then turn it around
(having drawn them in,

00:18:57.767 --> 00:19:00.786
seduced them if you will with
his words)--to turn around and

00:19:00.786 --> 00:19:03.549
then charge them with
something even worse.

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:05.498
The term "Israel" that he uses
is, of course,

00:19:05.498 --> 00:19:06.920
ambiguous.
That is one of the problems

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.140
with some of the prophetic
writings.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.088
You are never completely sure
whether they're prophesying

00:19:11.088 --> 00:19:14.380
against the northern kingdom,
Israel, or the House of

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:19.000
Israel--both kingdoms together,
the whole tribal confederation.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.340
Some passages in Amos would
suggest one.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.670
Some passages suggest the other.
 

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.865
The other thing that we find in
Amos is an oracle against Judah,

00:19:27.865 --> 00:19:29.930
against the southern kingdom.
 

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.680
This is in chapter 2.
 

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.881
It is just two lines,
verses 4 and 5,

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.410
and it is in chapter 2.
 

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.961
And many people identify that
as a later addition by an

00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:41.566
editor.
First of all,

00:19:41.566 --> 00:19:45.018
it's written in very standard,
sort of Deuteronomistic

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.293
language.
And also, if we leave it out,

00:19:47.293 --> 00:19:49.250
then we have a nice literary
pattern.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.210
We have six oracles plus one.
 

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:54.715
We have six oracles against
foreign nations,

00:19:54.715 --> 00:19:56.930
and then we have one against
Israel.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.677
And that pattern is a very
standard, literary pattern,

00:19:59.677 --> 00:20:02.788
particularly in poetic sections
of the Bible and the prophets

00:20:02.788 --> 00:20:05.069
are written in an elevated
poetic style.

00:20:05.069 --> 00:20:07.740
We very often have a six plus
one pattern.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.285
That's related to another
pattern that we also see in

00:20:10.285 --> 00:20:12.440
Amos, which is the three plus
one pattern.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.480
This is just a doubling of it,
six plus one.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.830
The three plus one pattern you
will recognize.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.789
It is quite explicit at times.
 

00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:22.247
Amos will say,
"for three transgressions of

00:20:22.247 --> 00:20:24.880
Damascus, for four,
I will not revoke it"--the

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.460
decree, the punishment.
 

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.102
A similar kind of language is
used in verse 6 for Gaza,

00:20:30.102 --> 00:20:32.867
in verse 9 for Tyre,
in verse 11 for Edom,

00:20:32.867 --> 00:20:35.970
and verse 13 for the Ammonites,
and so on.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.640
So we often have this pattern.
 

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.082
And so the suggestion by
scholars is that without that

00:20:41.082 --> 00:20:43.680
prophecy concerning the fall of
Judah,

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.834
which post-dates Amos,
you would have a nice complete

00:20:46.834 --> 00:20:48.230
six plus one pattern.
 

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.243
And this might be the sign of a
later editor updating Amos'

00:20:51.243 --> 00:20:53.737
prophecy, so that it would look
as though he had,

00:20:53.737 --> 00:20:55.920
in fact, prophesied the fall of
Judah.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.405
You have other sorts of
literary patterns and forms used

00:20:59.405 --> 00:21:00.990
in the prophetic works.
 

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.400
Some of the literary forms we
see are hymns.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.288
We see songs.
We see laments,

00:21:06.288 --> 00:21:09.682
particularly laments or
mourning for Israel as if her

00:21:09.682 --> 00:21:12.880
destruction is already a fait
accompli.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.420
You find proverbs.
 

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.967
Very often when the prophets
cite a proverb,

00:21:16.967 --> 00:21:19.930
they will turn its accepted
meaning on its head.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.449
They'll take an old proverb and
they'll apply it to some new

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:26.789
situation and give it a
radically new kind of meaning,

00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:29.519
to sort of shock and surprise
their audience.

00:21:29.519 --> 00:21:33.940
And Amos 3-8 contains a lot of
proverbs.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.673
Another literary form that we
will see, and this is an

00:21:36.673 --> 00:21:38.736
important one,
is a literary form that is

00:21:38.736 --> 00:21:40.490
called the riv,
r-i -v.

00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.907
I have it up there:
a riv,

00:21:42.907 --> 00:21:47.063
which basically means a
lawsuit, specifically a covenant

00:21:47.063 --> 00:21:50.168
lawsuit.
Many of the prophetic books

00:21:50.168 --> 00:21:54.648
feature passages in which God
basically brings a lawsuit

00:21:54.648 --> 00:21:58.056
against the people,
charging them with breach of

00:21:58.056 --> 00:22:00.539
covenant, breach of contract,
if you will.

00:22:00.539 --> 00:22:03.464
And in these passages,
you have legal metaphors being

00:22:03.464 --> 00:22:06.108
used throughout:
people testifying or witnessing

00:22:06.108 --> 00:22:09.539
against Israel--can she speak in
her defense?--and so on.

00:22:09.539 --> 00:22:11.564
So the riv,
or the covenant lawsuit is a

00:22:11.564 --> 00:22:12.619
form we will see here.
 

00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:15.740
We will also see it again when
we get to the Book of Job.

00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:19.555
So the prophetic corpus draws
on the entire range of literary

00:22:19.555 --> 00:22:23.369
forms that were available in
Israelite literary tradition,

00:22:23.369 --> 00:22:27.101
and very often gives them a
rich--and that is what give the

00:22:27.101 --> 00:22:29.609
books a very rich and varied
texture.

00:22:29.609 --> 00:22:33.459
So Amos is a model for us in
terms of its literary features,

00:22:33.459 --> 00:22:37.440
but it's also a model for us in
terms of some of the themes or

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.355
the content of the book--because
Amos will articulate certain

00:22:41.355 --> 00:22:44.487
themes that we will see
resounding throughout the

00:22:44.487 --> 00:22:46.380
prophetic literature.
 

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.779
There will be some variations
on these themes,

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:50.860
but some standard themes appear
here.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.319
So we will review those now.
 

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:55.998
Many scholars,
Kaufman among them,

00:22:55.998 --> 00:23:00.705
have noted that the literature
of the classical prophets is

00:23:00.705 --> 00:23:04.925
most clearly and strongly
characterized by a vehement

00:23:04.925 --> 00:23:09.632
denunciation of the moral decay
and social injustice of the

00:23:09.632 --> 00:23:13.076
period.
It really does not matter what

00:23:13.076 --> 00:23:15.183
period.
"Vehement denunciation" of

00:23:15.183 --> 00:23:17.920
moral decay and social
injustice, is the way the

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.259
Kaufman phrases it .
 

00:23:19.259 --> 00:23:22.210
Amos criticizes the sins of the
nation.

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.317
He is critical of everyone,
the middle class,

00:23:24.317 --> 00:23:26.519
the government,
the king, the establishment,

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:30.922
the priesthood--they're all
plagued by a superficial kind of

00:23:30.922 --> 00:23:33.054
piety.
For Amos, as for all the

00:23:33.054 --> 00:23:37.018
prophets we will be looking at,
the idea of covenant prescribes

00:23:37.018 --> 00:23:39.640
a particular relationship with
Yahweh,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.717
but not only with Yahweh:
also with one's fellow human

00:23:42.717 --> 00:23:44.740
beings.
The two are interlinked.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.856
It is a sign of closeness to
Yahweh that one is concerned for

00:23:48.856 --> 00:23:50.640
Israel's poor and needy.
 

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:54.259
The two are completely
intertwined and interlinked.

00:23:54.259 --> 00:23:56.259
And so Amos denounces the
wealthy.

00:23:56.259 --> 00:23:59.220
He denounces the powerful and
the way they treat the poor.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:02.015
I am going to be reading some
passages from Amos to illustrate

00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:03.069
some of these themes.
 

00:24:03.069 --> 00:24:07.834
So Amos 4:1-3--and listen to
the dramatic rhetoric that is

00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:11.343
used: "Hear this word,
you cows of Bashan/On the hill

00:24:11.343 --> 00:24:14.148
of Samaria"--that is the capital
of the northern kingdom,

00:24:14.148 --> 00:24:16.610
Israel:
Who defraud the poor,

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.220
Who rob the needy;
Who say to your husbands,

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.849
"Bring, and let's carouse!"
 

00:24:20.849 --> 00:24:23.310
My Lord God swears by His
holiness:

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:27.125
Behold, days are coming upon you
When you will be carried off in

00:24:27.125 --> 00:24:29.153
baskets,
And, to the last one,

00:24:29.153 --> 00:24:31.910
in fish baskets,
And taken out [of the city]--

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.730
Each one through a breach
straight ahead--

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.559
And flung on the refuse
heap.

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:39.491
It's a wonderful pun here,
because the wealthy women of

00:24:39.491 --> 00:24:41.880
Samaria are referred to as cows
of Bashan.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:46.126
Now Bashan is an area that is
very rich pastureland in the

00:24:46.126 --> 00:24:48.921
transJordan.
And also it is very common in

00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:51.638
Canaanite literature to refer to
the nobility,

00:24:51.638 --> 00:24:54.476
and even to gods,
with terms like bull or ram or

00:24:54.476 --> 00:24:56.739
cow.
These were not insulting terms,

00:24:56.739 --> 00:24:58.569
as they might be in our
culture.

00:24:58.569 --> 00:25:00.869
These were, in fact,
terms that did not offend.

00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:02.950
These were very complimentary
terms.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.929
So when he refers to the cows
of Bashan (he speaks to the

00:25:05.929 --> 00:25:09.281
women of Samaria as the cows of
Bashan) he is flattering them to

00:25:09.281 --> 00:25:12.038
begin with.
But the pun is quite wonderful

00:25:12.038 --> 00:25:15.630
because these women are going to
end up like fat cows,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.849
as slabs of meat in the
butcher's basket or in the fish

00:25:18.849 --> 00:25:20.339
basket which,
you know,

00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:23.190
is flung out on the refuse heap
once it is spoiled.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:27.397
So he takes that term "cows of
Bashan," and leads it to this

00:25:27.397 --> 00:25:33.230
horrendous end.
Amos 6:1 and 4-7.

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.598
This is another scathing attack
on the idle life of the carefree

00:25:37.598 --> 00:25:41.758
rich who ignore the plight of
the poor: woe to those "at ease

00:25:41.758 --> 00:25:43.902
in Zion."
Of course, that is the capital

00:25:43.902 --> 00:25:46.179
of the southern kingdom,
Jerusalem, and those "confident

00:25:46.179 --> 00:25:48.250
on the hill of Samaria," the
northern kingdom:

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.490
You notables of the
leading nation

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.550
On whom the House of Israel pin
their hopes;

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.550
[…]
They lie on ivory beds,

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:58.500
Lolling on their couches,
Feasting on lambs from the flock

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.210
And on calves from the stalls.
 

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.880
They hum snatches of song to
the tune of the lute--

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.170
They account themselves
musicians like David.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.309
They drink [straight]
from the wine bowls

00:26:08.309 --> 00:26:11.029
And anoint themselves with the
choicest oils--

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:13.520
But they are not concerned
about the ruin of Joseph.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.816
Assuredly, right soon
They shall head the column of

00:26:16.816 --> 00:26:18.902
exiles;
They shall lull no more at

00:26:18.902 --> 00:26:21.116
festive meals.
It is a great image of them

00:26:21.116 --> 00:26:22.470
lying about as the head of the
nation.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.230
They will be at the head of the
nation as it moves into exile!

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.836
And on an archaeological note,
I understand that in Samaria

00:26:28.836 --> 00:26:31.426
they have, in fact,
uncovered all kinds of ivory

00:26:31.426 --> 00:26:34.895
furniture and ivory coverings
that would then be attached to

00:26:34.895 --> 00:26:37.767
furniture.
So the image of them lolling on

00:26:37.767 --> 00:26:41.710
ivory couches in Samaria
apparently makes a lot of sense.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:45.056
So the moral decay,
the greed, the indulgence of

00:26:45.056 --> 00:26:48.332
the upper classes,
this is directly responsible

00:26:48.332 --> 00:26:52.177
for the social injustice that
according to the prophets

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:55.960
outrages God.
Amos 8:4-6:

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.215
Listen to this,
you who devour the needy,

00:26:58.215 --> 00:26:59.980
annihilating the poor of the
land,

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.418
saying, "If only the new moon
were over, so that we could sell

00:27:03.418 --> 00:27:04.493
grain;
the sabbath,

00:27:04.493 --> 00:27:07.352
so that we could offer wheat
for sale, using [a measure]

00:27:07.352 --> 00:27:09.328
that is too small and a shekel
[weight]

00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:12.257
that is too big,
tilting a dishonest scale,

00:27:12.257 --> 00:27:14.730
and selling grain refuse as
grain!

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.793
We will buy the poor for
silver, the needy for a pair of

00:27:17.793 --> 00:27:20.017
sandals.
The Lord swears by the pride of

00:27:20.017 --> 00:27:22.169
Jacob: I will never forget any
of [their]

00:27:22.169 --> 00:27:23.730
doings.
[See note 1]

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.137
Again, notice that they are
prone to extreme formulations

00:27:27.137 --> 00:27:30.269
and high-flown rhetoric,
and sometimes when you strip

00:27:30.269 --> 00:27:32.816
away the rhetoric,
you see that the crimes that

00:27:32.816 --> 00:27:34.920
are being denounced are not
murder,

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.470
and rape, or horrendous
physical violence.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.490
These are obvious and grievous
violations of social morality.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:46.858
Rather many scholars have
pointed out, I think Kaufman

00:27:46.858 --> 00:27:49.463
chief among them,
that the crimes that are

00:27:49.463 --> 00:27:53.340
denounced here are crimes that
are prevalent in any society in

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.604
any era.
The crimes that are denounced

00:27:55.604 --> 00:27:58.399
as being utterly unacceptable to
God, infuriating God to the

00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:00.200
point of destruction of the
nation,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.247
are the kinds of crimes we see
around us everyday,

00:28:03.247 --> 00:28:06.170
taking bribes,
improper weights and balances,

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.858
lack of charity to the poor,
indifference to the plight of

00:28:09.858 --> 00:28:12.700
the debtor.
A second theme that is pointed

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.500
out again by many scholars,
is what Kaufman calls the idea

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.500
of the primacy of morality.
 

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.243
That is to say the idea or the
doctrine that morality is not

00:28:22.243 --> 00:28:25.670
just an obligation equal in
importance to the cultic or

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:29.744
religious obligations,
but that morality is perhaps

00:28:29.744 --> 00:28:31.650
superior to the cult.
 

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:36.160
What God requires of Israel is
morality and not cultic service.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.882
Now, the prophets are all going
to have--we are going to see

00:28:38.882 --> 00:28:41.789
many different attitudes towards
the cult among the prophets.

00:28:41.789 --> 00:28:45.557
So allow that to become a more
nuanced statement as we go

00:28:45.557 --> 00:28:47.421
through.
Some are going to reject the

00:28:47.421 --> 00:28:48.570
cult of the entire nation.
 

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.777
Others will not.
So there is going to be some

00:28:50.777 --> 00:28:52.910
variation, but certainly
morality is primary.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.763
And their words could,
at times, be very harsh and

00:28:55.763 --> 00:28:56.870
very astonishing.
 

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:01.093
Amos 5:21-24.
"I loathe"--he is speaking now

00:29:01.093 --> 00:29:03.690
as God, right?
So God is speaking--God says:

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.220
"I loathe,
I spurn your festivals,

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.910
I am not appeased by your
solemn assemblies.

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.548
If you offer Me burnt
[sacrifices]

00:29:10.548 --> 00:29:13.510
or your meal [sacrifices]
I will not accept them;

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.869
I will pay no heed
To your gifts of fatlings.

00:29:16.869 --> 00:29:18.710
Spare me the sound of your
hymns,

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.170
And let Me not hear the music
of your lutes.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.670
But let justice well up like
water,

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:26.279
Righteousness like an unfailing
stream." [See note 2]

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:29.783
This is an attack on empty
piety, on the performance of

00:29:29.783 --> 00:29:32.859
rituals without any meaning,
perhaps, behind that

00:29:32.859 --> 00:29:36.246
performance, or in accompaniment
to social injustice--the two

00:29:36.246 --> 00:29:38.109
can't happen at the same time.
 

00:29:38.109 --> 00:29:40.761
And that's a theme that is
sounded repeatedly throughout

00:29:40.761 --> 00:29:41.869
prophetic literature.
 

00:29:41.869 --> 00:29:44.841
So for Amos,
and for all the prophets,

00:29:44.841 --> 00:29:46.849
injustice is sacrilege.
 

00:29:46.849 --> 00:29:50.410
The ideals of the covenant are
of utmost importance.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.998
That is why they are called the
standard bearers of the

00:29:52.998 --> 00:29:55.539
covenant, harking back to the
covenant obligations.

00:29:55.539 --> 00:29:58.247
And without these,
without the ideals of the

00:29:58.247 --> 00:30:02.024
covenant, the fulfillment of
cultic and ritual obligations in

00:30:02.024 --> 00:30:03.849
and of itself is a farce.
 

00:30:03.849 --> 00:30:06.795
That is not to say that they
would be rejected were Israel to

00:30:06.795 --> 00:30:08.170
be upholding the covenant.
 

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.680
So this rejection of the cult
depends, of course,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:15.410
on a caricature of cultic and
ritual performance.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.920
The prophets caricature it as
meaningless.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.194
They caricature it as
unconcerned with ethics or with

00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:23.839
the ideals of justice and
righteousness.

00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:27.113
But internal cultural conflicts
often do involve the

00:30:27.113 --> 00:30:30.771
caricaturing or the ridiculing
of an opponent's beliefs or

00:30:30.771 --> 00:30:33.301
practices.
But for some of the prophets

00:30:33.301 --> 00:30:35.690
rejection of the cult was quite
radical.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:39.059
That is an idea that is not yet
really fully formed in Amos.

00:30:39.059 --> 00:30:41.017
We are going to see,
again, that some of the

00:30:41.017 --> 00:30:43.930
prophets will reject the cult of
the nation, not just the cult of

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.250
the wicked, but everyone.
 

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:48.412
Even if performed properly and
by righteous persons,

00:30:48.412 --> 00:30:51.699
there will be one or two
prophets who believe the cult

00:30:51.699 --> 00:30:55.109
has no inherent value or no
absolute value for God.

00:30:55.109 --> 00:30:57.799
In some sense,
this is a view that we have

00:30:57.799 --> 00:31:01.670
already encountered in sources
devoted to the cult even in a

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.359
source like P,
the Priestly material.

00:31:04.359 --> 00:31:07.247
The Priestly material is
already moving towards the idea,

00:31:07.247 --> 00:31:10.816
or establishing the idea,
that the cult is an expression

00:31:10.816 --> 00:31:13.789
of divine favor rather than
divine need.

00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:18.461
It doesn't really have an
actual value necessarily for

00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:20.736
God.
It doesn't really affect his

00:31:20.736 --> 00:31:23.098
vitality.
It is given to humans as a

00:31:23.098 --> 00:31:25.640
ritual conduit,
as a way to attract and

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.849
maintain God's presence within
the community,

00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:33.440
or to procure atonement for
deeds or impurities that might

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.339
temporarily separate one from
God.

00:31:36.339 --> 00:31:38.871
So already in the Priestly
source, we have a very

00:31:38.871 --> 00:31:41.824
complicated notion of the
function of the for society and

00:31:41.824 --> 00:31:44.460
humanity.
So the prophetic doctrine of

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.569
the primacy of morality seems to
be a reaction against other

00:31:48.569 --> 00:31:52.301
views of cultic practice;
perhaps there were popular

00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:56.343
assumptions about the automatic
efficacy of the cult and its

00:31:56.343 --> 00:31:59.234
rites.
But Kaufman has been joined by

00:31:59.234 --> 00:32:03.253
many other scholars who argue
that the prophets raised

00:32:03.253 --> 00:32:07.500
morality to the level of an
absolute religious value,

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.850
and they did so because they
saw morality as essentially

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:14.003
divine .
The essence of God is his moral

00:32:14.003 --> 00:32:16.730
nature.
Moral attributes are the

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.799
essence of God himself.
 

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:21.941
So Kaufman notes that he who
requires justice and

00:32:21.941 --> 00:32:25.606
righteousness and compassion
from human beings is himself

00:32:25.606 --> 00:32:28.290
just and righteous and
compassionate.

00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.430
This is the prophetic view.
 

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:34.462
The moral person can
metaphorically be said to share

00:32:34.462 --> 00:32:37.381
in divinity.
This is the kind of apotheosis

00:32:37.381 --> 00:32:40.160
that you find then in the
prophetic writings,

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.871
not the idea of a
transformation into a divine

00:32:42.871 --> 00:32:45.039
being in life or even after
death,

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:50.542
but the idea that one strives
to be god-like by imitating his

00:32:50.542 --> 00:32:54.085
moral actions,
the idea again of imitatio

00:32:54.085 --> 00:32:56.572
dei.
A third feature of the

00:32:56.572 --> 00:33:00.508
prophetic writings,
this is again underscored by

00:33:00.508 --> 00:33:03.279
Kaufman,
but also many other scholars,

00:33:03.279 --> 00:33:06.978
and that is the prophets' view
of history, their particular

00:33:06.978 --> 00:33:10.722
view of history,
their interpretation of the

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:14.099
catastrophic events of 722 and
586.

00:33:14.099 --> 00:33:18.179
It is an interpretation that
centers on their elevation of

00:33:18.179 --> 00:33:22.329
morality, because the prophets
insisted that morality was a

00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:25.331
decisive,
if not the decisive factor,

00:33:25.331 --> 00:33:27.250
in the nation's history.
 

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:31.648
Israel's acceptance of God's
covenant placed certain

00:33:31.648 --> 00:33:34.839
religious and moral demands on
her.

00:33:34.839 --> 00:33:38.308
Now in the Deuteronomistic view
that we have talked about,

00:33:38.308 --> 00:33:41.960
one sin is singled out as being
historically decisive for the

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.976
nation.
Other sins are punished,

00:33:43.976 --> 00:33:46.135
absolutely.
But only one is singled out as

00:33:46.135 --> 00:33:49.207
being historically decisive for
the nation, and that is the sin

00:33:49.207 --> 00:33:51.393
of idolatry,
particularly the idolatry of

00:33:51.393 --> 00:33:53.546
the royal house.
So the Deuteronomistic

00:33:53.546 --> 00:33:56.971
historian presents the tragic
history of the two kingdoms as

00:33:56.971 --> 00:33:59.990
essentially a sequence of
idolatrous aberrations,

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.579
which were followed by
punishment.

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:06.091
And this cycle continued until
finally there had to be complete

00:34:06.091 --> 00:34:08.822
destruction.
While it is certainly true that

00:34:08.822 --> 00:34:12.137
moral sins and other religious
sins in Israel were punishable

00:34:12.137 --> 00:34:15.617
in the Deuteronomist's view,
it is really only the worship

00:34:15.617 --> 00:34:18.603
of other gods that brings about
national collapse,

00:34:18.603 --> 00:34:22.040
national exile.
And that view is exemplified in

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.909
2 Kings 17, which I have read to
you.

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:28.084
It does not mention moral sins
as leading to the collapse of

00:34:28.084 --> 00:34:30.309
the state.
It harps on idolatry.

00:34:30.309 --> 00:34:36.260
Idolatry was what provoked God
to drive the nation into exile.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.989
The view of the classical
prophets is a little different.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:42.453
Israel's history is determined
by moral factors,

00:34:42.453 --> 00:34:44.590
not just religious factors.
 

00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:47.188
So the nation is punished not
only for idolatry,

00:34:47.188 --> 00:34:48.570
but for moral failings.
 

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:49.943
And, of course,
the two are to a large degree

00:34:49.943 --> 00:34:52.295
intertwined.
But the emphasis on the moral

00:34:52.295 --> 00:34:54.210
is striking in the prophets.
 

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:58.123
And it may not be so startling
to hear that God would doom a

00:34:58.123 --> 00:35:01.306
generation or doom a nation for
grave moral sins,

00:35:01.306 --> 00:35:03.230
like murder and violence.
 

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:06.207
This is something we have
already seen in the generation

00:35:06.207 --> 00:35:08.631
of the flood.
The cities of Sodom and

00:35:08.631 --> 00:35:12.486
Gomorrah--they were destroyed
for grievous violations of

00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:15.289
morality: murder,
violence and so on.

00:35:15.289 --> 00:35:17.935
The prophets,
however, are claiming that the

00:35:17.935 --> 00:35:20.949
nation is doomed because of
commonplace wrongs,

00:35:20.949 --> 00:35:24.062
because of bribe-taking,
because of false scales and

00:35:24.062 --> 00:35:27.420
false weights that are being
used in the marketplace.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.817
These are the crimes for which
destruction of the nation and

00:35:30.817 --> 00:35:32.200
exile will take place.
 

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.300
Amos 2:6 through 8:
Thus said the Lord:

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.159
For three transgressions of
Israel,

00:35:37.159 --> 00:35:40.639
For four, I will not revoke it
[the decree of destruction]:

00:35:40.639 --> 00:35:42.889
Because they have sold for
silver

00:35:42.889 --> 00:35:45.948
Those whose cause was just
[taking bribes in a courtroom

00:35:45.948 --> 00:35:48.097
setting],
And the needy for a pair of

00:35:48.097 --> 00:35:50.199
sandals.
You who trample the heads of

00:35:50.199 --> 00:35:52.059
the poor
Into the dust of the ground,

00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:55.000
And make the humble walk a
twisted course!

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.095
So this is the first difference
really between the

00:35:58.095 --> 00:36:01.759
Deuteronomistic interpretation
of the nation's history--the

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:05.550
destruction of Israel--and the
prophetic interpretation.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.331
For the prophets,
the national catastrophes are

00:36:08.331 --> 00:36:11.173
just punishment for sin,
but not just the sin of

00:36:11.173 --> 00:36:13.416
idolatry,
for all sins no matter how

00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:16.609
petty, now matter how venial,
because all sins violate the

00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:19.863
terms of the covenant code,
which is given specially to

00:36:19.863 --> 00:36:21.432
Israel.
And the terms of the

00:36:21.432 --> 00:36:24.795
covenant--being vassals to the
sovereign Yahweh means treating

00:36:24.795 --> 00:36:28.292
co-vassals in a particular way,
and it is breach of covenant

00:36:28.292 --> 00:36:30.659
not to do that.
And, again, how much the

00:36:30.659 --> 00:36:33.539
prophets were harking back to an
older tradition,

00:36:33.539 --> 00:36:36.539
to ancient traditions about
Israel and its covenant

00:36:36.539 --> 00:36:39.952
relationship,
traditions according to which

00:36:39.952 --> 00:36:44.860
Israel's redemption and election
entailed moral obligations;

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.192
how much they were the ones to
actually generate and argue for

00:36:48.192 --> 00:36:50.760
this idea again is hotly debated
by scholars.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:53.900
It is not an issue that we need
to decide.

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:57.705
But I would note that the
primacy of morality in Israelite

00:36:57.705 --> 00:37:01.511
religion certainly dates back at
least to the times of the

00:37:01.511 --> 00:37:04.551
earliest prophets,
Amos in the eighth century for

00:37:04.551 --> 00:37:06.960
example, and may indeed have had
antecedents.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.061
It certainly didn't just arise
in the exile as some scholars

00:37:11.061 --> 00:37:12.730
would have us believe.
 

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.604
It certainly was not the
invention of the Deuteronomistic

00:37:15.604 --> 00:37:18.141
historian.
It's alive and well in some of

00:37:18.141 --> 00:37:19.869
these very early prophets.
 

00:37:19.869 --> 00:37:22.846
I am going to turn now to the
second difference between the

00:37:22.846 --> 00:37:25.412
Deuteronomistic and the
prophetic interpretation of

00:37:25.412 --> 00:37:26.489
Israel's history.
 

00:37:26.489 --> 00:37:29.715
And that is that the prophets
coupled their message of tragedy

00:37:29.715 --> 00:37:32.360
and doom with a message of hope
and consolation.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.377
And this is something that just
simply doesn't come within the

00:37:35.377 --> 00:37:38.000
purview of the Deuteronomistic
historian's writing.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.485
First let me say a little bit
about the message of doom and

00:37:41.485 --> 00:37:44.070
then the message of hope and
consolation.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.377
One of the things that's so
interesting in the classical

00:37:47.377 --> 00:37:51.226
prophets is that they give a new
content to older Israelite ideas

00:37:51.226 --> 00:37:54.909
about the end of days,
or what we call eschatology.

00:37:54.909 --> 00:37:57.229
Eschatology = an account
of the eschaton,

00:37:57.229 --> 00:37:58.690
eschaton meaning the
end.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:02.010
So eschatology is an account of
the end.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:05.006
The prophets warned that unless
they changed,

00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:08.957
the people were going to suffer
the punishment that was due

00:38:08.957 --> 00:38:10.332
them.
And, in fact,

00:38:10.332 --> 00:38:13.909
the people were very foolish to
be eagerly awaiting or eagerly

00:38:13.909 --> 00:38:17.370
expecting what was popularly
known as the Day of Yahweh,

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.340
or the Day of the Lord.
 

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.050
 
 

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:26.123
And so the prophets refer to
the Day of Yahweh as if it were

00:38:26.123 --> 00:38:29.039
a popular conception out there
in the general culture.

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:32.332
It was a popular idea at the
time that on some future

00:38:32.332 --> 00:38:36.194
occasion God would dramatically
intervene in world affairs and

00:38:36.194 --> 00:38:38.599
he would do so on Israel's
behalf.

00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:40.960
He would lead Israel in victory
over her enemies.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.780
They would be punished.
 

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:45.710
Israel would be restored to her
full and former glory.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.380
And that day,
the Day of the Lord or the Day

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:51.873
of Yahweh, in the popular mind,
was going to be a marvelous

00:38:51.873 --> 00:38:54.919
day, a day of victory for
Israel, triumph for Israel and a

00:38:54.919 --> 00:38:56.789
day of vengeance on her enemies.
 

00:38:56.789 --> 00:39:01.273
Amos 5:18 and 29,
talks about the people as

00:39:01.273 --> 00:39:04.690
desirous of the Day of Yahweh.
 

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.347
They are very confident that
this is going to be a day of

00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:09.340
light, a day of blessing,
a day of victory,

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.009
he says.
But the prophets,

00:39:11.009 --> 00:39:13.659
Amos among them,
tell a different story.

00:39:13.659 --> 00:39:16.556
According to them,
if there is no change then this

00:39:16.556 --> 00:39:20.103
Day of Yahweh is not going to be
some glorious thing that the

00:39:20.103 --> 00:39:22.349
people should be eagerly
awaiting.

00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:24.210
It's not going to be a day of
triumph for Israel.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.820
It will not be a day of
vengeance on her enemies.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.309
It's going to be a dark day of
destruction.

00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:33.048
It is going to be a day of doom
when God will finally call his

00:39:33.048 --> 00:39:34.519
own people to account.
 

00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:38.226
So this is another instance of
the way in which the prophets

00:39:38.226 --> 00:39:41.870
try to radically surprise their
audience by taking an older

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.639
concept and reversing its
meaning, changing its meaning.

00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:48.872
And here they have transformed
the popular image of the Day of

00:39:48.872 --> 00:39:51.681
Yahweh from one of national
triumph to one of national

00:39:51.681 --> 00:39:55.030
judgment.
Amos 5:18 through 20:

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.460
Ah, you who wish
For the day of the Lord!

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.540
Why should you want
The day of the Lord?

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.150
It shall be darkness, not light!
 

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:03.430
--As if a man should run from a
lion

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.340
And be attacked by a bear;
Or if he got indoors,

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.663
Should lean his hand on the wall
And be bitten by a snake![there

00:40:08.663 --> 00:40:10.849
is going to be no place to hide,
in other words}

00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:12.280
Surely the day of the Lord
shall be

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.965
Not light, but darkness,
Blackest night without a

00:40:14.965 --> 00:40:18.719
glimmer.
Or chapter 8:9 through 12:

00:40:18.719 --> 00:40:20.540
And in that day--declares
my Lord God--

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:23.937
I will make the sun set at noon,
I will darken the earth on a

00:40:23.937 --> 00:40:26.266
sunny day.
I will turn your festivals into

00:40:26.266 --> 00:40:28.510
mourning
And all your songs into dirges;

00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:30.420
I will put sackcloth on all
loins

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.819
And tonsures on every head.
 

00:40:31.819 --> 00:40:34.807
[mourning rites]
I will make it mourn as for an

00:40:34.807 --> 00:40:37.583
only child,
All of it as on a bitter

00:40:37.583 --> 00:40:40.000
day.
So again at the heart of this

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.218
idea that the Day of Yahweh is
being transformed into this day

00:40:43.218 --> 00:40:45.416
of judgment,
is the old idea that God is the

00:40:45.416 --> 00:40:46.460
God of history.
Right?

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.510
God can control the destiny of
nations.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:51.520
He can control the actions of
nations.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.780
That is not a new idea.
 

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.511
But in the past,
or not so much in the past,

00:40:55.511 --> 00:40:59.132
I suppose--it would have been
present to the prophets--the

00:40:59.132 --> 00:41:03.007
prophets were reacting against a
notion that God's involvement

00:41:03.007 --> 00:41:07.199
with other nations was always
undertaken on Israel's behalf.

00:41:07.199 --> 00:41:09.650
This is the idea they seem to
be battling.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:12.305
In other words,
they are battling the idea or

00:41:12.305 --> 00:41:15.322
the assumption that God
controlled other nations by

00:41:15.322 --> 00:41:18.942
exercising judgment on them and
punishing them and subjecting

00:41:18.942 --> 00:41:21.577
them to Israel.
And the prophets are

00:41:21.577 --> 00:41:23.150
challenging this idea.
 

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:27.030
And they are making what would
have been heard as a shocking

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.739
and extraordinary claim.
 

00:41:28.739 --> 00:41:31.027
God is, of course,
yes, a God of history,

00:41:31.027 --> 00:41:33.516
of all history.
He is concerned with all

00:41:33.516 --> 00:41:35.159
nations, not only Israel.
 

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:39.636
But his involvement with other
nations doesn't extend merely to

00:41:39.636 --> 00:41:41.079
their subjugation.
 

00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:45.113
If need be, or rather if Israel
deserves, then God will raise up

00:41:45.113 --> 00:41:46.969
another nation against her.
 

00:41:46.969 --> 00:41:49.955
So the final chapter in Amos
begins by proclaiming this idea

00:41:49.955 --> 00:41:51.119
of utter destruction.
 

00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:54.112
I will slay them all,
God says, and "not one of them

00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:55.919
shall survive."
Wherever they hide,

00:41:55.919 --> 00:41:57.240
under the earth,
in the heavens,

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.541
at the bottom of the sea,
God is going to haul them out

00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:00.990
and He is going to slay them.
 

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.480
And what about the covenant?
 

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:07.280
Isn't it a guarantee of
privilege or safety?

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.253
Again, for Amos,
its primary function is to bind

00:42:10.253 --> 00:42:14.239
the nation in a code of conduct,
and violations of that code are

00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:16.389
going to be severely punished.
 

00:42:16.389 --> 00:42:20.294
So in chapter 9 verses 7 to 8,
Amos makes the startling claim

00:42:20.294 --> 00:42:23.938
that in God's eyes Israel is
really no different from the

00:42:23.938 --> 00:42:25.500
rest of the nations.
 

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.590
He elevated her.
He can also lower her.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.766
To Me,
O Israelites,

00:42:29.766 --> 00:42:31.900
you are
Just like the Ethiopians

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.300
True, I brought Israel up
From the land of Egypt,

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.010
But also the Philistines from
Caphtor

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:39.090
And the Aramaeans from Kir.
 

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:43.180
Behold, the Lord God has His eye
Upon the sinful kingdom:

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.240
I will wipe it off
The face of the earth!

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.380
These are harsh, harsh words.
 

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.335
And you also have to remember
that Amos was living in a time

00:42:50.335 --> 00:42:52.639
of relative peace and
prosperity, about 750.

00:42:52.639 --> 00:42:55.530
National confidence is riding
high.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.878
The people of Israel were
pretty convinced that God was

00:42:57.878 --> 00:42:59.918
with them.
They weren't in any real

00:42:59.918 --> 00:43:01.690
imminent or obvious danger.
 

00:43:01.690 --> 00:43:05.672
And Amos was convinced that
despite this external appearance

00:43:05.672 --> 00:43:08.170
of health, the nation was
diseased.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.565
They were guilty of social
crimes and unfaithfulness to

00:43:10.565 --> 00:43:11.940
their covenantal obligations.
 

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.719
And so he says they are headed
down this path of destruction.

00:43:15.719 --> 00:43:20.173
Perhaps because of the optimism
of the time, Amos had to

00:43:20.173 --> 00:43:24.950
emphasize this message of doom,
because his book is a pretty

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:27.866
depressing book.
Later prophets who were

00:43:27.866 --> 00:43:30.233
speaking in a different
historical setting,

00:43:30.233 --> 00:43:32.599
in a more desperate historical
setting,

00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:38.290
would often speak words of much
more comfort and hope.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:40.030
But Amos doesn't do this.
 

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:43.239
He does indicate that his
purpose is the reformation or

00:43:43.239 --> 00:43:45.260
the reorientation of the nation.
 

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.610
He wants to awaken Israel to
the fact that change is needed.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:53.212
Amos 5:14 and 15,
"Seek good and not evil,/That

00:43:53.212 --> 00:43:58.067
you may live,/And that the Lord,
the God of Hosts,/May truly be

00:43:58.067 --> 00:44:00.260
with you,/As you think."
 

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.660
Right now you think he is with
you.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.442
He's not.
Change, so that he will

00:44:03.442 --> 00:44:04.789
truly be with you.
 

00:44:04.789 --> 00:44:08.060
"Hate evil and love good,/And
establish justice in the

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:11.023
gate;/Perhaps the Lord,
the God of Hosts,/Will be

00:44:11.023 --> 00:44:13.429
gracious to the remnant of
Joseph."

00:44:13.429 --> 00:44:16.806
The "perhaps" is important,
and it is very indicative of

00:44:16.806 --> 00:44:19.566
Amos' fatalism.
This is very much a fatalistic

00:44:19.566 --> 00:44:21.997
book.
The overriding theme of Amos'

00:44:21.997 --> 00:44:25.020
message is that punishment is
inevitable.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.500
It is pretty much inevitable.
 

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:29.768
And this is one of the reasons
that most scholars believe that

00:44:29.768 --> 00:44:34.305
the final verses of the book,
verses halfway through 8 down

00:44:34.305 --> 00:44:38.469
to 15, are a later addition by
an editor.

00:44:38.469 --> 00:44:41.411
It is an epilogue,
and it was likely added in

00:44:41.411 --> 00:44:45.421
order to relieve the gloom and
the pessimism and the fatalism

00:44:45.421 --> 00:44:49.294
of the prophet's message,
because in these verses,

00:44:49.294 --> 00:44:52.599
Amos does an almost complete
about-face.

00:44:52.599 --> 00:44:58.949
We have just finished the first
half of verse 8 in Chapter 9.

00:44:58.949 --> 00:45:02.376
So 9:8a--you have this oracle
of complete and devastating

00:45:02.376 --> 00:45:04.930
judgment: "Behold,
the Lord God has His eye/Upon

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:07.820
the sinful kingdom:/I will wipe
it off/The face of the earth."

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.173
But then, the second half of
the verse, and the beginning of

00:45:10.173 --> 00:45:11.610
this epilogue that has been
added,

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.613
immediately dilutes this:
"But, I will not wholly wipe

00:45:14.613 --> 00:45:17.219
out/The House of Jacob
--declares the Lord."

00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:21.679
It seems that an editor has
qualified this last oracle of

00:45:21.679 --> 00:45:26.140
doom, has desired to qualify
this last oracle of doom.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.270
And the editor continues,
For I will give the order

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.060
And shake the House of Israel--
Through all the nations--

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.592
As one shakes [sand] in a sieve,
And not a pebble falls to the

00:45:35.592 --> 00:45:37.160
ground.
All the sinners of My people

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.060
Shall perish by the sword,
Who boast,

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.030
"Never shall the evil
Overtake us or come near us."

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.683
In that day,
I will set up again the fallen

00:45:44.683 --> 00:45:47.090
booth of David;
I will mend its breaches and

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:48.340
set up its ruins anew.
 

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.200
I will build it firm as in the
days of old,

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:52.362
[...]
A time is coming--declares the

00:45:52.362 --> 00:45:52.900
Lord --
[...]

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.159
When the mountains shall drip
wine

00:45:55.159 --> 00:45:57.610
And all the hills shall wave
[with grain].

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.280
I will restore my people Israel.
 

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.380
They shall rebuild ruined
cities and inhabit them;

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:03.351
[...]
They shall till gardens and eat

00:46:03.351 --> 00:46:04.789
their fruits.
And I will plant them upon

00:46:04.789 --> 00:46:06.630
their soil,
Nevermore to be uprooted

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:09.791
From the soil I have given
them--said the Lord your

00:46:09.791 --> 00:46:11.238
God.
In other words,

00:46:11.238 --> 00:46:13.672
according to this epilogue,
God's punishment of Israel

00:46:13.672 --> 00:46:15.050
isn't the end of the story.
 

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.678
It is one step in a process,
and the affliction and the

00:46:17.678 --> 00:46:19.090
punishment serve a purpose.
 

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:22.420
It is to purge the dross,
to chasten Israel.

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.119
They are going to be put
through a sieve.

00:46:24.119 --> 00:46:25.849
Only the sinners will really
perish.

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:28.858
A remnant, presumably a
righteous remnant,

00:46:28.858 --> 00:46:32.968
will be permitted to survive
and in due time that remnant

00:46:32.968 --> 00:46:34.510
will be restored.
 

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.427
To summarize Amos,
and hopefully this will give us

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:40.940
then some foothold as we move
into other prophetic books,

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:45.307
we need to understand that the
Book of Amos is a set of oracles

00:46:45.307 --> 00:46:48.830
by a prophet addressing a
concrete situation in the

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.309
northern kingdom.
 

00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:54.334
It's been subject to some
additions that reflect the

00:46:54.334 --> 00:46:56.860
perspective of a later editor.
 

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:00.014
Amos' message was that sin
would be punished by God and it

00:47:00.014 --> 00:47:03.500
would be punished on a national
level--the nation would fall.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.866
When the northern kingdom fell,
it was understood to be a

00:47:06.866 --> 00:47:08.610
fulfillment of Amos' words.
 

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.897
The Assyrians were the
instruments of God's just

00:47:10.897 --> 00:47:13.962
punishment.
So his words were preserved in

00:47:13.962 --> 00:47:15.663
Judah.
After Judah fell,

00:47:15.663 --> 00:47:19.663
presumably a later editor added
a few key passages to reflect

00:47:19.663 --> 00:47:23.139
this later reality,
most significantly the oracle

00:47:23.139 --> 00:47:27.159
against Judah in chapter 2,
verses 4-5, and the epilogue in

00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:29.700
chapter 9,
verse 8b through 15,

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:34.377
which explicitly seem to refer
to the fall of the southern

00:47:34.377 --> 00:47:36.850
kingdom.
It refers to a future day when

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.050
the fallen booth of David will
be raised.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:41.641
That reflects a knowledge of
the end of Judah,

00:47:41.641 --> 00:47:43.599
the end of the Davidic
kingship.

00:47:43.599 --> 00:47:45.558
And the phrase "on that day"
which is used,

00:47:45.558 --> 00:47:48.264
is a phrase that often signals
what we feel is an editorial

00:47:48.264 --> 00:47:49.849
insertion in a prophetic book.
 

00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:53.107
It is pointing forward to some
vague future time of

00:47:53.107 --> 00:47:54.659
restoration.
Okay.

00:47:54.659 --> 00:47:59.000
On Monday, we are going to be
moving on to Hosea and Isaiah.

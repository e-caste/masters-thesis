00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.429
Professor David Swensen:
 Let me start out by

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:09.723
putting what I think is a
relatively controversial

00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:13.421
proposition on the table and
that's that this investment

00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:17.433
management business,
when stripped down to its bare

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.150
essentials, is really quite
simple.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.593
Now, why do I say that?
Well, I think if we took the

00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:29.940
group here today and divided you
up into smaller groups of four,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.197
or five, or six and asked you
to talk about what's really

00:00:35.197 --> 00:00:40.173
important in managing a
portfolio that has a very long

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:44.196
time horizon,
I think that almost all the

00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:48.420
groups would come to very
similar conclusions.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.797
If you're investing with a long
time horizon,

00:00:51.797 --> 00:00:54.560
having an equity bias makes
sense;

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.890
stocks go up in the long run.
Bob Shiller's friend,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.075
Jeremy Siegel,
wrote a book that has the very

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:04.550
simple title,
Stocks For The Long Run.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.239
Well, the book is assigned;
you all know it.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:10.449
The other thing that I think
would come out of the

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:13.790
discussions is that
diversification is important.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.884
Anybody whose read a basic
finance text,

00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:20.535
as a matter of fact,
I think anybody who thinks

00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:24.741
about investments in a common
sense fashion knows that

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:29.582
diversification is an important
fundamental tenet of portfolio

00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:32.450
management.
As a matter of fact,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.190
Harry Markowitz called
diversification a "free lunch."

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.220
We spend all our time in intro.
econ.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.136
figuring out there is no such
thing as a free lunch but

00:01:42.136 --> 00:01:45.269
Markowitz tells us that
diversification is a free lunch.

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:48.480
For any given level of return,
you can reduce--For any given

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.930
level of risk,
you can increase the return;

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.239
sounds pretty good.
That's pretty simple, right?

00:01:55.239 --> 00:02:00.048
Two tenets, an equity bias for
portfolios with a long time

00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:04.063
horizon and diversification.
Bob mentioned in his

00:02:04.063 --> 00:02:07.402
introduction that I showed up at
Yale in 1985,

00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:10.889
after having spent six years on
Wall Street,

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:16.076
and I was totally unencumbered
by any portfolio management

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:19.310
experience.
I thought that was pretty neat.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.771
Here I was, back at Yale,
with a billion dollar

00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.910
portfolio--it seemed like a lot
of money at the time--no

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.590
portfolio management experience.
What do I do?

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.593
Well, one of the things I think
is a sensible thing to do in

00:02:35.593 --> 00:02:39.580
life is look around at what
others are doing,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.533
so I looked at what colleges
and universities had done in

00:02:43.533 --> 00:02:48.702
terms of asset allocation.
Turns out that 50% of endowment

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:54.263
assets in the mid-1980s were
invested in common stocks,

00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:58.280
40% of endowment assets were in
U.S.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.439
bonds and U.S.
cash, and 10% in a smattering

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.137
of alternatives.
Well, I looked at that and I

00:03:06.137 --> 00:03:10.240
thought, this doesn't really
make a lot of sense.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.686
You have half of your assets in
one single asset class:

00:03:14.686 --> 00:03:16.629
U.S.
common stocks.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.850
You've got another 40% of your
assets in U.S.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.767
bonds and cash.
So 90% of your portfolio is in

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:30.589
domestic marketable securities
and only 10% is invested in

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:34.988
things like real estate or
venture capital or private

00:03:34.988 --> 00:03:39.810
equity--hardly enough to make a
difference in terms of the

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.683
portfolios returns.
Unencumbered by,

00:03:43.683 --> 00:03:49.436
I guess, the conventional
wisdom, we started out at Yale

00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:54.874
on a path that I think
is--fundamentally that changed

00:03:54.874 --> 00:04:00.000
the way that institutions manage
portfolios.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.006
A few years ago,
I wrote a book called

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.229
Pioneering Portfolio
Management.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.936
The reason you could put an
audacious title like

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:12.116
Pioneering Portfolio
Management on the cover of

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:17.085
the book was that we moved away
from this traditional model with

00:04:17.085 --> 00:04:21.817
50% in stocks and 40% in bonds
and cash to something that was

00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:26.550
much more equity-oriented and
much more diversified.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.996
What I'd like to do today is
talk to you about how it is that

00:04:31.996 --> 00:04:37.171
we moved from this old model to
what it is that today many

00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:40.529
institutions call the Yale
model.

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:44.811
The way that I would like to
talk about this journey that we

00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:49.310
took is by looking at the tools
that we have available to us as

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.736
investors--these tools are the
same tools that we have whether

00:04:53.736 --> 00:04:57.727
we're operating as individual
investors or institutional

00:04:57.727 --> 00:05:02.081
investors--and describe how we
employ those tools at Yale and

00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:06.579
how they led us to the portfolio
that we have today.

00:05:06.579 --> 00:05:11.540
Those three tools are asset
allocation, market timing,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.261
and security selection.
The first, asset allocation,

00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:20.430
basically deals with which
assets you have in your

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.598
portfolio and in which
proportion you hold each of

00:05:24.598 --> 00:05:28.344
those assets.
The second, market timing,

00:05:28.344 --> 00:05:32.603
deals with short-term
deviations from the long-term

00:05:32.603 --> 00:05:36.009
asset allocations that you
establish.

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:38.169
And the third,
securities selection,

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.809
speaks to how it is you manage
each of your individual asset

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.117
classes.
Are you going to hold the

00:05:44.117 --> 00:05:46.311
market portfolio,
index your assets,

00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:50.777
match the markets results?
Or are you going to manage each

00:05:50.777 --> 00:05:55.988
individual asset class actively,
trying to beat the market and

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:59.490
generate risk-adjusted excess
returns?

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.149
Let's start out with the first:
asset allocation.

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:06.164
I think it's pretty widely
known that asset allocation is

00:06:06.164 --> 00:06:10.536
far and away the most important
tool that we have available to

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:13.261
us as investors.
As a matter of fact,

00:06:13.261 --> 00:06:16.877
it's so widely believed that
asset allocation is the most

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:20.429
important tool that I think some
people have come to the

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:24.174
conclusion that it's some sort
of law of finance that asset

00:06:24.174 --> 00:06:27.079
allocation is the most important
tool.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:31.419
It turns out that it's not a
financial law that asset

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.115
allocation takes center stage;
it really is more a description

00:06:36.115 --> 00:06:40.057
of how it is that we behave.
Yale actually has a lot more

00:06:40.057 --> 00:06:44.079
than the billion dollars that we
started with in 1985.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.183
I think the estimate sheet that
I got yesterday morning said

00:06:47.183 --> 00:06:49.550
that we've got about $22.5
billion dollars;

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.033
so that's been a nice run.
If I went back to my office

00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:58.662
after speaking with you this
morning and took Yale's $22.5

00:06:58.662 --> 00:07:03.129
billion dollars and put all of
it into Google stock,

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.763
asset allocation would have
very little to say about what

00:07:06.763 --> 00:07:09.647
Yale's returns would be.
As a matter of fact,

00:07:09.647 --> 00:07:13.120
security selection would
absolutely dominate the results.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.584
The idiosyncratic behavior of
Google stock from the time that

00:07:16.584 --> 00:07:20.107
we purchase it to the time that
we sell it would define Yale's

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:21.894
returns.
Alternatively,

00:07:21.894 --> 00:07:26.350
if I went back to the office
and took Yale's $22.5 billion

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.509
dollars and decided that I was
going to day trade bond futures,

00:07:31.509 --> 00:07:35.015
security selection wouldn't
have anything to say about the

00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:36.774
returns;
asset allocation wouldn't have

00:07:36.774 --> 00:07:38.110
anything to say about the
returns.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.595
The returns would be
attributable solely to my

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:45.389
ability to market time the bond
futures market.

00:07:45.389 --> 00:07:49.459
Now, I'm not going to do either
one of those things.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:52.164
I'm not going to put Yale's
entire portfolio in Google

00:07:52.164 --> 00:07:55.379
stock, I'm not going to go back
and take Yale's entire portfolio

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:58.353
to day-trade bond futures;
in part, because it would be

00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:01.036
bad for me personally.
I think I would be fired as

00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:04.417
soon as people found out what it
was that I was doing with the

00:08:04.417 --> 00:08:07.550
portfolio and,
overwhelmingly more important,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.180
it would be bad for the
University.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:15.288
It's not a rational thing to do.
What will happen is that Yale

00:08:15.288 --> 00:08:20.458
will continue to hold a
relatively well-diversified

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:26.455
portfolio as defined by the
range of asset classes in which

00:08:26.455 --> 00:08:30.064
it invests.
When you look at each of those

00:08:30.064 --> 00:08:32.866
individual asset
classes--domestic equities,

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:35.422
foreign equities,
bonds, real assets,

00:08:35.422 --> 00:08:39.312
absolute return and private
equity--each of those individual

00:08:39.312 --> 00:08:43.136
asset classes is going to be
relatively well-diversified in

00:08:43.136 --> 00:08:46.763
terms of exposures to individual
positions or individual

00:08:46.763 --> 00:08:50.253
securities.
Because that's true,

00:08:50.253 --> 00:08:56.356
then asset allocation ends up
being the overwhelmingly

00:08:56.356 --> 00:09:02.460
important determinant of the
University's results.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.648
Because we hold relatively
stable, relatively

00:09:05.648 --> 00:09:09.706
well-diversified portfolios,
security selection turns out

00:09:09.706 --> 00:09:13.547
not to be an important
determinant of returns for most

00:09:13.547 --> 00:09:17.823
investors and market timing
turns out not to be an important

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:23.245
determinant of returns.
The last man standing is asset

00:09:23.245 --> 00:09:29.597
allocation and that tends to
drive both institutional returns

00:09:29.597 --> 00:09:33.428
and individual returns.
Roger Ibbotson,

00:09:33.428 --> 00:09:37.527
who is a colleague of Bob
Shiller's and mine at the School

00:09:37.527 --> 00:09:40.683
of Management,
has done a fair amount of work,

00:09:40.683 --> 00:09:43.863
studying the relative
importance of these sources of

00:09:43.863 --> 00:09:46.487
returns.
He's come to the conclusion

00:09:46.487 --> 00:09:50.719
that over 90% of the variability
of returns in institutional

00:09:50.719 --> 00:09:55.024
portfolios is attributable to
asset allocation and that's the

00:09:55.024 --> 00:09:59.544
number that I think most people
hear cited when they are looking

00:09:59.544 --> 00:10:03.516
at Roger Ibbotson's work.
I think one of the more

00:10:03.516 --> 00:10:07.743
interesting and even simpler
concepts that comes out of his

00:10:07.743 --> 00:10:12.043
study is that more than 100% of
returns are defined by asset

00:10:12.043 --> 00:10:15.240
allocation.
Now, how can that be true?

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.744
How can asset allocation be
responsible for more than 100%

00:10:18.744 --> 00:10:22.405
of investment returns?
Well, it can only be true if

00:10:22.405 --> 00:10:26.153
security selection and market
timing detract from

00:10:26.153 --> 00:10:29.978
institutional returns or
individual returns in the

00:10:29.978 --> 00:10:34.318
aggregate.
Of course, if think about it,

00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:38.907
as a community,
the investment community is

00:10:38.907 --> 00:10:44.480
going to lose from security
selection decisions.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.788
If security selection is a
zero-sum game,

00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:52.832
the amount by which the winner
wins equals the amount by which

00:10:52.832 --> 00:10:57.050
the loser loses--winners and
losers being defined by

00:10:57.050 --> 00:11:01.268
performance after a security
selection that has been

00:11:01.268 --> 00:11:04.108
made--well,
that sounds like a zero-sum

00:11:04.108 --> 00:11:06.102
game.
But then, if you take into

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:09.659
account that you create market
impact when you trade,

00:11:09.659 --> 00:11:13.203
that you pay commissions when
you trade and you frequently pay

00:11:13.203 --> 00:11:16.689
advisors substantial amounts of
money--whether they're mutual

00:11:16.689 --> 00:11:20.000
fund managers or institutional
fund managers--there's this

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.311
leakage from the system that
causes the active results for

00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:26.100
the community as a whole to be
negative.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.850
Absolutely the same thing is
true on the market timing front.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.161
I mean, to the extent that
you're making these short-term

00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:35.591
bets against your long-term
policy, it requires trading and

00:11:35.591 --> 00:11:39.149
trading is expensive.
It's very expensive when you

00:11:39.149 --> 00:11:42.342
take into account not only the
direct costs,

00:11:42.342 --> 00:11:46.946
but also the costs that you pay
advisors to help you make these

00:11:46.946 --> 00:11:50.234
decisions.
So, it's not surprising that

00:11:50.234 --> 00:11:55.049
asset allocation explains more
than 100% of returns and that,

00:11:55.049 --> 00:11:59.259
for the community as a whole,
market timing and security

00:11:59.259 --> 00:12:03.469
selection are costly and lower
the community's aggregate

00:12:03.469 --> 00:12:06.990
investment returns.
It's a little bit of a

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.553
digression, but one of the
things that I've witnessed over

00:12:11.553 --> 00:12:16.355
the past twenty years is that
the leakage of the--the leakage

00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:21.398
from the system in terms of the
returns that go to the owners of

00:12:21.398 --> 00:12:25.320
capital--leakage has increased
enormously.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.992
Think about the advent of hedge
funds--twenty or twenty-five

00:12:28.992 --> 00:12:32.539
years ago, hedge funds were a
blip on the radar screen.

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:37.323
Today, they're a very important
part of the fund's management

00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:40.892
framework.
Well, those hedge funds charge

00:12:40.892 --> 00:12:45.768
enormously more than what a
standard manage or marketable

00:12:45.768 --> 00:12:50.462
securities firm charges.
Well, that leakage--that 1.5%

00:12:50.462 --> 00:12:55.148
or 2% that you pay your hedge
fund manager--plus the 20% of

00:12:55.148 --> 00:12:59.107
profits really reduces the
amount of return that's

00:12:59.107 --> 00:13:02.419
available for the owners of
capital.

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:07.671
This idea that the difference
between the returns that you

00:13:07.671 --> 00:13:11.909
would get if you took your asset
allocation,

00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:15.965
implemented passively,
and the actual results that the

00:13:15.965 --> 00:13:20.402
active investors get--the gap
between those two numbers--is

00:13:20.402 --> 00:13:23.539
becoming larger and larger over
time,

00:13:23.539 --> 00:13:27.339
generating more and more
returns for the provider of

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:31.884
investment management services
and lower and lower returns for

00:13:31.884 --> 00:13:35.610
those that are hiring those
external advisors.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:41.643
To get back on track,
let's look at the basic

00:13:41.643 --> 00:13:49.732
underpinnings to this notion
that asset allocation is at the

00:13:49.732 --> 00:13:57.000
center of the investor's
decision-making process.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.675
There are two points that we
talked about--the hypothetical

00:14:01.675 --> 00:14:06.270
points that came out of the
small group discussions that I

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:11.510
suggested we might think about
at the beginning of this talk.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:16.337
First, in terms of equity bias.
Now, we're going to go back to

00:14:16.337 --> 00:14:19.090
Roger Ibbotson at the School of
Management.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:24.406
He did some path breaking work
in terms of describing capital

00:14:24.406 --> 00:14:29.279
markets returns over reasonably
long periods of time.

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:31.735
I guess you've already looked
at Stocks for the Long

00:14:31.735 --> 00:14:34.148
Run;
you've seen 200 years worth of

00:14:34.148 --> 00:14:37.406
data.
Roger Ibbotson's data goes back

00:14:37.406 --> 00:14:43.045
to 1925 and these are the actual
numbers we used when we first

00:14:43.045 --> 00:14:49.240
started doing our mean-variance
optimization in our simulations,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.840
trying to come to conclusions
about what the appropriate

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.720
allocations would be for Yale's
portfolio.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.659
I'm sure you're familiar with
the drill--you put a dollar into

00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:02.461
various asset classes,
in this case,

00:15:02.461 --> 00:15:07.370
at the end of 1925 and hold
those asset classes for,

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.009
in this case,
eighty-one years;

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:11.860
the numbers go through the end
of 2006.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.255
As you put a dollar in treasury
bills, you end up with a

00:15:15.255 --> 00:15:17.710
nineteen multiple;
that sounds pretty good.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.688
You get nineteen times your
money over eighty-one years,

00:15:20.688 --> 00:15:23.775
but then if you take into
account the inflation consumes a

00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:26.916
multiple of eleven and you're an
institution like Yale that

00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:29.289
consumes only,
after inflation returns,

00:15:29.289 --> 00:15:32.246
putting your money into
treasury bills really didn't get

00:15:32.246 --> 00:15:34.793
you very much.
Suppose you step out in the

00:15:34.793 --> 00:15:38.000
risk spectrum and put a dollar
into the bond market.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.580
Over that eighty-one year
period you would have gotten a

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.006
multiple of seventy-two.
Well, now we're talking some

00:15:44.006 --> 00:15:47.710
real after inflation returns
that can be umed.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:52.665
But, when you move from lending
money to the government--either

00:15:52.665 --> 00:15:57.701
short-term with bills or longer
term with bonds--to investing in

00:15:57.701 --> 00:16:01.747
the equity market,
there's a stunning difference

00:16:01.747 --> 00:16:05.775
in terms of the returns.
Just by putting money into a

00:16:05.775 --> 00:16:10.181
broadly diversified portfolio of
stocks you would have gotten

00:16:10.181 --> 00:16:13.961
3,077 times your money.
If you would have stepped

00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:18.226
further out of the risk spectrum
and put your money into a

00:16:18.226 --> 00:16:22.642
portfolio of small stocks you
would have gotten 15,922 times

00:16:22.642 --> 00:16:25.697
your money.
So, ownership of stocks

00:16:25.697 --> 00:16:30.219
absolutely crushes buying
bonds--almost 16,000 times your

00:16:30.219 --> 00:16:35.064
money or more than 3,000 times
your money in the stock market

00:16:35.064 --> 00:16:39.748
as opposed to 72 times your
money or 19 times your money in

00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:43.139
the bond market or the bill
market.

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:47.903
It almost makes you wonder
whether this diversification

00:16:47.903 --> 00:16:50.990
thing makes any sense.
I mean, why would you do that?

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.237
Why would you put any of your
assets in bonds if stocks are

00:16:55.237 --> 00:16:58.460
going to give you 16,000 times
your money?

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.433
That bond multiple of 72 is
just a drag on returns--what's

00:17:02.433 --> 00:17:04.442
the point?
This question,

00:17:04.442 --> 00:17:09.047
particularly in the late 1980s,
was very important to me

00:17:09.047 --> 00:17:13.234
personally because we were
trying to put together a

00:17:13.234 --> 00:17:18.425
sensible portfolio for Yale and
if that sensible portfolio just

00:17:18.425 --> 00:17:22.528
involved identifying the
high-risk asset class and

00:17:22.528 --> 00:17:27.124
putting all your assets into,
let's say, small stocks,

00:17:27.124 --> 00:17:30.662
it wouldn't take the investment
committee very long to figure

00:17:30.662 --> 00:17:33.610
out that they didn't need to pay
me to do that;

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.904
they could do that on their own.
And if they didn't need to pay

00:17:36.904 --> 00:17:40.570
me, then I wouldn't have any
income to put food on the table

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.302
for my wife and children.
So, there had to be more to it

00:17:44.302 --> 00:17:47.622
than just identifying the
high-risk asset class and

00:17:47.622 --> 00:17:50.809
putting your assets there and
letting it rip.

00:17:50.809 --> 00:17:55.313
I went back and took a closer
look at Roger Ibbotson's data

00:17:55.313 --> 00:18:00.359
and there are lots of examples
that will illustrate this point,

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:03.828
but the most dramatic occurs
around the crash in October

00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:06.493
1929.
For every dollar that you had

00:18:06.493 --> 00:18:11.170
in small stocks at the peak of
the market, by the end of 1929,

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:15.294
you lost 54% of your money.
By the end of 1930,

00:18:15.294 --> 00:18:18.750
you lost another 38% of your
money;

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:24.210
by the end of 1931,
you lost another 50%;

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:31.730
and by the end of--by June of
1932, you lost another 32%.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.717
So, for every dollar that you
had at the peak,

00:18:35.717 --> 00:18:38.730
at the trough you had $.10
left.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.532
At some point,
when your dollars were turning

00:18:42.532 --> 00:18:45.730
into dimes, you'd say,
forget this,

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.235
this is ridiculous,
it doesn't make any sense for

00:18:49.235 --> 00:18:52.230
me to own these risky small-cap
stocks.

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:57.269
And you would sell your small
stocks and put your money where?

00:18:57.269 --> 00:19:00.490
Either in treasury bonds or
treasury bills.

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.096
And of course,
that's what the overwhelming

00:19:04.096 --> 00:19:08.561
portion of the investment
community did in the 1930s,

00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:11.910
and in the 1940s,
and in the 1950s.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:16.936
As long as there was a memory
of the searing experience that

00:19:16.936 --> 00:19:22.048
people had in the equity markets
around the time of the great

00:19:22.048 --> 00:19:25.399
crash,
people reacted to it by saying,

00:19:25.399 --> 00:19:29.753
avoid this risky asset,
it doesn't make any sense for a

00:19:29.753 --> 00:19:34.752
fiduciary or for an individual
to own these risky things called

00:19:34.752 --> 00:19:37.260
stocks.
As a matter of fact,

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.266
I was looking at some of the
contemporary literature,

00:19:41.266 --> 00:19:45.065
the popular literature,
and there was an article in the

00:19:45.065 --> 00:19:47.440
Saturday Evening Post that
basically said,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.162
you shouldn't call stocks
securities--that was a

00:19:50.162 --> 00:19:53.375
ridiculous thing to call them;
they should be called

00:19:53.375 --> 00:19:55.690
insecurities because they were
so risky.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:00.250
Of course, this attitude came
at exactly the wrong time.

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:05.567
If you put a dollar into small
stocks in June of 1932,

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:10.082
by the end of 2006,
you would have had 159,000

00:20:10.082 --> 00:20:14.825
times your money.
Just at the point of maximum

00:20:14.825 --> 00:20:20.284
opportunity people were at the
point of maximum bearishness

00:20:20.284 --> 00:20:24.665
about the equity markets.
The take-aways are that an

00:20:24.665 --> 00:20:28.224
equity bias is an absolutely
sensible underpinning for

00:20:28.224 --> 00:20:30.977
investors with long time
horizons but that

00:20:30.977 --> 00:20:36.012
diversification is important.
You have to limit your exposure

00:20:36.012 --> 00:20:41.250
to risky asset classes to a
level that allows you to sustain

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:46.399
those positions even in the face
of terribly adverse market

00:20:46.399 --> 00:20:51.654
conditions.
Let's move to the second point:

00:20:51.654 --> 00:20:56.480
market timing.
I actually have a quotation

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.210
here.
A few months ago,

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.295
some former students of
mine--former colleagues of

00:21:01.295 --> 00:21:04.569
mine--gave this very nice party
at the Yale Club.

00:21:04.569 --> 00:21:09.617
I used to teach a big lecture
class when I first got to Yale

00:21:09.617 --> 00:21:14.665
in the late 1980s and my last
lecture always involved taking

00:21:14.665 --> 00:21:19.905
Keynes's General Theory,
and quoting from what I think

00:21:19.905 --> 00:21:24.474
is Keynes--is one of the most
wonderful writers about issues

00:21:24.474 --> 00:21:27.339
surrounding investment
management.

00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:30.150
This particular copy was pretty
dog-eared;

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.860
as a matter of fact,
it was a paperback copy and I

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:36.069
think it was in about eight or
ten different pieces and the

00:21:36.069 --> 00:21:38.779
people that threw this party
remembered that,

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:42.799
so they gave me it at this
celebration.

00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:46.513
It made me wonder if they were
trying to tell that I should

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:49.710
retire;
it felt like a retirement party.

00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.359
I feel like I'm way too young
to retire.

00:21:51.359 --> 00:21:54.313
But as a gift,
they gave me a first edition of

00:21:54.313 --> 00:21:58.322
Keynes's General Theory.
I was coming back to New Haven

00:21:58.322 --> 00:22:01.640
on the train afterwards and I
came across this quote.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.257
Keynes wrote that,
"The idea of wholesale shifts

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:08.798
is for various reasons
impracticable and indeed

00:22:08.798 --> 00:22:11.720
undesirable.
Most of those who attempt to

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.980
sell too late and buy too late
and do both too often,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.445
incurring heavy expenses and
developing too unsettled and

00:22:18.445 --> 00:22:21.779
speculative state of mind."
He's absolutely right.

00:22:21.779 --> 00:22:25.888
I wrote my first book--I
already talked about that,

00:22:25.888 --> 00:22:30.325
Pioneering Portfolio
Management--that deals with

00:22:30.325 --> 00:22:34.680
the challenges that face
institutional investors.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.901
Subsequently,
I wrote a book called

00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:40.495
Unconventional Success
that deals with individual

00:22:40.495 --> 00:22:43.025
investors.
In Unconventional

00:22:43.025 --> 00:22:47.628
Success, I did a study of
individual behavior in their

00:22:47.628 --> 00:22:52.231
mutual fund purchases and sales
around the collapse of the

00:22:52.231 --> 00:22:55.299
Internet bubble in March of
2000.

00:22:55.299 --> 00:22:59.873
What I did was I took the ten
best-performing Internet funds

00:22:59.873 --> 00:23:03.440
and looked at the returns from
1997 to 2002.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.488
Now this is,
I think, a surprising starting

00:23:07.488 --> 00:23:10.348
point.
If you look at the ten

00:23:10.348 --> 00:23:14.904
best-performing Internet funds
from 1997 to 2002,

00:23:14.904 --> 00:23:20.029
the time-weighted return is
1.5% per year positive,

00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:23.960
so the funds went way up and
then they went way down.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.763
But it's positive 1.5% per
year, time-weighted--that's the

00:23:26.763 --> 00:23:29.467
number that you see in the
prospectus or the number that

00:23:29.467 --> 00:23:31.730
you see in the
advertisements--so you say,

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.019
what's the big deal,
no harm no foul.

00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:37.709
Well, there's another way to
look at returns--those are the

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:41.780
dollar-weighted returns--and the
dollar-weighted returns actually

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:45.533
do a better job of describing
the experience of the group of

00:23:45.533 --> 00:23:48.650
investors that participated in
these funds.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.946
Dollar-weighted obviously takes
into account when the cash flows

00:23:52.946 --> 00:23:58.684
come in and when they go out.
When you do the dollar-weighted

00:23:58.684 --> 00:24:05.817
returns, you find out that there
was $13.7 billion invested in

00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:12.482
these funds and the investors
lost $9.9 billion out of the

00:24:12.482 --> 00:24:19.285
13.7 that they committed;
so, 72% of the money that was

00:24:19.285 --> 00:24:23.150
invested in these funds was
lost.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:27.284
Because of the way that we deal
with taxes and mutual funds,

00:24:27.284 --> 00:24:31.278
you can get a tax bill for
gains that were realized by the

00:24:31.278 --> 00:24:35.483
investment manager turning over
the portfolio even though you

00:24:35.483 --> 00:24:39.828
might not have held the shares
during the period when the gains

00:24:39.828 --> 00:24:43.143
were realized.
So, in addition to losing $9.9

00:24:43.143 --> 00:24:46.394
billion, there were capital
gains' distributions of $3.3

00:24:46.394 --> 00:24:49.882
billion dollars representing
about 24% of the money that was

00:24:49.882 --> 00:24:52.585
invested.
So, adding insult to injury,

00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:56.604
you lost 72% of the money and
then you got a tax bill for 24%

00:24:56.604 --> 00:24:59.150
of the amount that had been put
in;

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.298
not a very happy experience.
After I wrote the book,

00:25:03.298 --> 00:25:08.244
Morningstar did a much more
comprehensive study of every

00:25:08.244 --> 00:25:13.279
single one of the equity
categories that they follow.

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:17.254
There were seventeen categories
of equity mutual funds and they

00:25:17.254 --> 00:25:21.099
compared the dollar-weighted to
the time-weighted returns.

00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:25.445
In every one of those seventeen
categories, the dollar-weighted

00:25:25.445 --> 00:25:29.020
returns were less than the
time-weighted returns.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:33.407
Well, how does that happen?
The same way that these

00:25:33.407 --> 00:25:37.710
investors and the Internet tech
funds lost their money.

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.335
They bought after the funds had
gone up and they sold after they

00:25:42.335 --> 00:25:45.500
had gone down.
When you buy high and sell low

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.415
it's really hard to generate
returns, even if you do it with

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:51.869
great enthusiasm and great
volume.

00:25:51.869 --> 00:25:57.904
The Morningstar study is
incredibly damning in terms of

00:25:57.904 --> 00:26:03.940
the market timing abilities of
individual investors.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.207
Systematically,
investors are buying after

00:26:06.207 --> 00:26:08.752
things have gone up,
selling after they've gone

00:26:08.752 --> 00:26:11.473
down,
and the problem is most severe

00:26:11.473 --> 00:26:15.180
in those funds that show the
greatest volatility.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.103
The gap in what Morningstar
calls the "conservative

00:26:19.103 --> 00:26:21.849
allocation fund" is .3% per
year.

00:26:21.849 --> 00:26:25.188
Now, that's not a huge number
but, obviously,

00:26:25.188 --> 00:26:29.589
when you're hoping to beat the
market by a point or two,

00:26:29.589 --> 00:26:34.094
losing by .3% per year because
of your market timing inability

00:26:34.094 --> 00:26:36.915
is a bad thing.
But if you look at the tech

00:26:36.915 --> 00:26:39.234
fund category,
the difference between the

00:26:39.234 --> 00:26:42.307
dollar-weighted and the
time-weighted returns--this is

00:26:42.307 --> 00:26:45.090
over a ten-year period--is 13.4%
per annum;

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:48.878
that's stunning.
Compound that 13.4% over ten

00:26:48.878 --> 00:26:52.535
years and there's just an
enormous gap between those

00:26:52.535 --> 00:26:56.552
mutual fund numbers that are in
the prospectus and in the

00:26:56.552 --> 00:27:01.070
advertisement--the time-weighted
returns and the dollar-weighted

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:04.728
returns that talk about the
actual experience of the

00:27:04.728 --> 00:27:09.429
investment community.
I'm not just going to pick on

00:27:09.429 --> 00:27:13.034
individual investors,
I'm going to pick on

00:27:13.034 --> 00:27:17.539
institutional investors too.
One of the studies that I did

00:27:17.539 --> 00:27:20.055
for my first book,
Pioneering Portfolio

00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:23.142
Management,
looked at the behavior of

00:27:23.142 --> 00:27:27.345
endowments and foundations
around the crash in October

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:31.213
1987.
I used to talk about the crash

00:27:31.213 --> 00:27:37.033
in October 1987 without
explaining what it was and I do

00:27:37.033 --> 00:27:42.962
still teach a seminar in the
economics department in the

00:27:42.962 --> 00:27:45.987
Fall.
I started talking about what

00:27:45.987 --> 00:27:50.020
happened in October 1987 and I
looked around the room and I

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.636
realized that I think the
students were three or four

00:27:53.636 --> 00:27:57.738
years old in 1987 and weren't
yet reading The Wall Street

00:27:57.738 --> 00:28:01.560
Journal.
So, just to give you a little

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.836
bit of context,
the crash was really an

00:28:04.836 --> 00:28:08.812
extraordinary event.
According to my calculations it

00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:11.640
was a twenty-five standard
deviation event.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.332
One standard deviation happens
one draw out of three,

00:28:15.332 --> 00:28:19.308
two standard deviations one out
of twenty, three standard

00:28:19.308 --> 00:28:22.220
deviations is one out of one
hundred.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:28.027
An eight standard deviation
event happens once out of every

00:28:28.027 --> 00:28:32.224
six trillion trials.
You can't come up with a number

00:28:32.224 --> 00:28:35.700
to describe the twenty-five
standard deviation event;

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:40.815
it's just too large a number,
I think, for any of us to

00:28:40.815 --> 00:28:45.400
really comprehend.
In essence, this collapse in

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.397
stock prices--the one-day
collapse in stock prices--I

00:28:50.397 --> 00:28:53.045
think in the U.S.
the price was,

00:28:53.045 --> 00:28:55.324
depending on which index you
were looking at,

00:28:55.324 --> 00:28:57.190
were down 21-22% in a single
day.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:01.215
Interestingly,
most major markets around the

00:29:01.215 --> 00:29:04.960
world were off by a similar
magnitude.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.043
This one-day collapse in stock
prices was a virtual

00:29:09.043 --> 00:29:12.804
impossibility.
Of course, this was just a

00:29:12.804 --> 00:29:17.190
change in stock prices;
it wasn't related to any

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.694
fundamental change in the
economy or any fundamental

00:29:21.694 --> 00:29:26.579
change in corporate prospects.
It was just a financial event.

00:29:26.579 --> 00:29:33.130
If stock prices went down--by
the way, bond prices went up.

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:35.153
When people were selling
stocks, money had to go

00:29:35.153 --> 00:29:36.819
somewhere.
Well, it went into the bond

00:29:36.819 --> 00:29:38.734
market.
There was a huge rally in

00:29:38.734 --> 00:29:40.940
treasury bonds on October
19,1987.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:45.830
So, stocks were cheaper and
bonds were more expensive.

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:50.573
Well, what do you do?
You buy what's cheap and sell

00:29:50.573 --> 00:29:54.264
what's expensive.
But what did endowments and

00:29:54.264 --> 00:29:58.391
foundations do?
Well, if you look at the annual

00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:03.460
reports of their asset
allocation, in June of 1987,

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:06.738
their equity allocation was
higher than it had been for

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:09.838
fifteen years.
The '70s were a terrible time

00:30:09.838 --> 00:30:13.362
to invest in stocks,
a bull market had started in

00:30:13.362 --> 00:30:15.572
1982.
We were five years into this

00:30:15.572 --> 00:30:18.874
bull market and people were
getting excited about the fact

00:30:18.874 --> 00:30:22.177
that stocks were going up and
equity allocations were at a

00:30:22.177 --> 00:30:25.115
fifteen-year high.
Of course, the money had to

00:30:25.115 --> 00:30:28.030
come from somewhere,
so bond allocations were at a

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:32.660
fifteen-year low.
Fast forward to June 30,1988

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:39.418
and stock allocations had
dropped and, not only had they

00:30:39.418 --> 00:30:43.686
dropped,
they dropped by more than the

00:30:43.686 --> 00:30:49.218
decline in stock prices
associated with this collapse in

00:30:49.218 --> 00:30:53.264
October 19,1987.
Bond allocations had increased

00:30:53.264 --> 00:30:57.604
by more than could be explained
by the increase in bond prices

00:30:57.604 --> 00:31:02.399
over the course of the year.
The only conclusion that you

00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:07.670
could draw is these supposedly
sophisticated institutional

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:12.201
investors sold stocks in
November and December and

00:31:12.201 --> 00:31:17.472
January because they were
fearful and they bought bonds in

00:31:17.472 --> 00:31:21.028
October,
November, and December--maybe

00:31:21.028 --> 00:31:25.589
because they were fearful or
maybe because they were greedy.

00:31:25.589 --> 00:31:30.160
Emotion ruled the decisions,
not rational economic calculus.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:36.381
The costs were huge--not just
the immediate costs in terms of

00:31:36.381 --> 00:31:41.790
the move from stocks to bonds.
It took these institutions

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:46.774
until 1993--a full six years--to
get their bond allocation back

00:31:46.774 --> 00:31:51.920
down to where it had been prior
to the crash in October 1987.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.664
And this is in the context of
one of the greatest bull markets

00:31:54.664 --> 00:31:56.970
ever.
You certainly have to measure

00:31:56.970 --> 00:31:59.852
the bull market,
from 1982 to 2000 and some

00:31:59.852 --> 00:32:03.970
people would say that 2000 was
just a blip and we're still in

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.172
this bull market.
But regardless of how you

00:32:07.172 --> 00:32:09.812
measure it, for a full
half-dozen years,

00:32:09.812 --> 00:32:12.250
in the midst of this bull
market,

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:16.329
colleges and universities were
over-allocated to fixed income

00:32:16.329 --> 00:32:19.730
relative to where they had been
in June of 1987.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:26.150
The take-away is to avoid
market timing.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:33.966
The underlying driving force
behind market timing decisions

00:32:33.966 --> 00:32:38.865
seems to be emotional--fear,
greed, chasing

00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:41.920
performance--buying something
after it has gone up,

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.726
disappointment,
and sales after something has

00:32:45.726 --> 00:32:48.226
declined.
As opposed to rationally

00:32:48.226 --> 00:32:51.815
stepping up when something
appears relatively attractive

00:32:51.815 --> 00:32:55.273
and overweighting and then
leaning against the wind by

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:58.210
selling something that's
performed well.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.000
Final source of
returns--security selection.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.843
We've already talked about how
security selection is a zero-sum

00:33:05.843 --> 00:33:08.016
game.
The only way that somebody can

00:33:08.016 --> 00:33:11.378
overweight Ford Motor Company in
the market is to have somebody

00:33:11.378 --> 00:33:14.415
have a counter position where
they underweight Ford Motor

00:33:14.415 --> 00:33:16.510
Company;
only one of those is going to

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:18.167
be right.
It's measured by subsequent

00:33:18.167 --> 00:33:20.783
performance in the amount by
which the winner wins equals the

00:33:20.783 --> 00:33:23.618
amount by which the loser loses,
but it costs a lot to play the

00:33:23.618 --> 00:33:25.205
game.
As a matter of fact,

00:33:25.205 --> 00:33:29.114
it costs an increasing amount
to play the game when you look

00:33:29.114 --> 00:33:32.891
at the fees that are paid to
investment managers and hedge

00:33:32.891 --> 00:33:35.545
funds.
So, after taking into account

00:33:35.545 --> 00:33:38.069
the market impact,
and the commissions,

00:33:38.069 --> 00:33:40.792
and the fees,
this zero-sum game becomes a

00:33:40.792 --> 00:33:45.564
negative-sum game.
When you look at the returns

00:33:45.564 --> 00:33:51.126
for institutions,
you see exactly what it is that

00:33:51.126 --> 00:33:55.995
you'd expect.
Here's ten years worth of data

00:33:55.995 --> 00:34:00.821
from the Frank Russell
Corporation, the benchmark

00:34:00.821 --> 00:34:05.596
Wilshire 5000.
For the ten years ended June

00:34:05.596 --> 00:34:12.277
30,2005, it returned 9.9% per
year and then the average return

00:34:12.277 --> 00:34:18.630
for the actively managed equity
fund was 9.6% per year,

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:20.719
so we're back to that thirty
basis points.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:27.074
Maybe on average institutions
lose thirty basis points,

00:34:27.074 --> 00:34:32.980
but it's kind of Lake Wobegon,
where we all believe that we're

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:36.501
better than average,
so we're going to overcome that

00:34:36.501 --> 00:34:40.159
thirty basis points--that's not
such a big hurdle.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:44.647
There's a very important
phenomenon that you need to take

00:34:44.647 --> 00:34:49.455
into account when you look at
these histories of returns that

00:34:49.455 --> 00:34:52.420
are generated by active
managers.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.524
This is true whether you look
at the universe of the mutual

00:34:55.524 --> 00:34:58.842
fund managers that we might have
available to us as individuals

00:34:58.842 --> 00:35:00.930
or whether it's institutional
data,

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:06.219
such as those that I just cited;
that concept is survivorship

00:35:06.219 --> 00:35:09.108
bias.
The only numbers that appear

00:35:09.108 --> 00:35:14.177
for the trailing ten years are
numbers that are associated with

00:35:14.177 --> 00:35:17.119
firms that are still in
business.

00:35:17.119 --> 00:35:23.863
There were probably a number of
firms that, over that ten-year

00:35:23.863 --> 00:35:28.836
period, went out of business.
Now, which firms do you think

00:35:28.836 --> 00:35:31.411
went out of business?
Not the ones that are producing

00:35:31.411 --> 00:35:33.838
great results.
The problem is even more severe

00:35:33.838 --> 00:35:37.222
when you're looking at mutual
funds because there's kind of a

00:35:37.222 --> 00:35:40.550
cynical game that mutual fund
management companies play.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:44.851
If they have an underperforming
fund, sometimes they allow it to

00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:47.501
die a dignified death;
although, that doesn't happen

00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:49.229
very often.
What they usually do is they

00:35:49.229 --> 00:35:52.034
take the underperforming fund
and they merge it with one that

00:35:52.034 --> 00:35:55.149
has a better track record.
All of a sudden the

00:35:55.149 --> 00:36:00.797
underperforming fund's record
disappears and the assets are in

00:36:00.797 --> 00:36:05.705
a fund that has a better
record--a record that you can

00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:09.072
actually market.
Then when we look at the

00:36:09.072 --> 00:36:12.511
statistics, all we see are a lot
of assets in the fund that

00:36:12.511 --> 00:36:15.534
performed well and the
underperforming fund that was

00:36:15.534 --> 00:36:18.440
merged out of existence isn't
there anymore.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.130
How important is this
survivorship bias?

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:27.988
If you look at the Frank
Russell data--and I just cited

00:36:27.988 --> 00:36:34.389
ten-year returns ending June
30,2005, so that period started

00:36:34.389 --> 00:36:39.272
in 1996--well,
in 1996 there were 307 managers

00:36:39.272 --> 00:36:45.445
that reported returns.
By the time 2005 rolled around,

00:36:45.445 --> 00:36:50.504
there were only 177 managers
that reported returns,

00:36:50.504 --> 00:36:55.354
so 130 managers disappeared.
Now, more than 130 managers

00:36:55.354 --> 00:36:58.021
failed because,
in addition to survivorship

00:36:58.021 --> 00:37:01.070
bias, there's something called
backfill bias.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.758
That's when a new manager
appears subsequent to the

00:37:04.758 --> 00:37:07.340
beginning of the ten-year
period;

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.885
they'll put not only the new
numbers in, but they'll take the

00:37:12.885 --> 00:37:17.968
history of the new manager and
put that history into the

00:37:17.968 --> 00:37:21.310
database.
Which direction is that going

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.436
to move the numbers?
Well, that's going to inflate

00:37:24.436 --> 00:37:27.643
the numbers too because the only
managers that kind of raise

00:37:27.643 --> 00:37:30.684
their hand and say,
hey I've got this interesting

00:37:30.684 --> 00:37:34.118
new approach to managing
domestic equities--or whatever

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:37.679
the asset class is--are the ones
that have succeeded.

00:37:37.679 --> 00:37:42.489
You've got survivorship bias
taking out bad records and then

00:37:42.489 --> 00:37:46.320
you've got backfill bias adding
good records.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:51.721
They both cause the universe of
active management returns to

00:37:51.721 --> 00:37:57.214
appear to be better than the
reality because there's a lot in

00:37:57.214 --> 00:38:02.158
there that doesn't have anything
to do with the average

00:38:02.158 --> 00:38:04.900
experience of,
in this case,

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.451
an institutional investor.
Sometimes the numbers can be

00:38:08.451 --> 00:38:10.943
pretty dramatic;
I mean, 2000 was a year of

00:38:10.943 --> 00:38:14.196
great flux in the markets
because that's when the Internet

00:38:14.196 --> 00:38:17.933
bubble burst.
If you looked at the domestic

00:38:17.933 --> 00:38:22.898
equity return--the average
return that was posted in

00:38:22.898 --> 00:38:27.703
2000--it was -3.1%.
Then if you fast forward to

00:38:27.703 --> 00:38:33.621
2005 and look at the average
return that was posted for 2000,

00:38:33.621 --> 00:38:36.439
it was +1.2%.
So, the combination of

00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:39.876
survivorship bias and backfill
bias for that one year made 4.3

00:38:39.876 --> 00:38:44.542
percentage points difference.
As reported contemporaneously

00:38:44.542 --> 00:38:50.267
in 2000, the number was -3.1%
but if you look at the number

00:38:50.267 --> 00:38:53.880
reported for 2005,
because bad records had

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.100
disappeared and good records had
been added, all of a sudden the

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.650
average experience for that year
went up to +1.2%.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:05.760
This is incredibly important
because, when you look at this

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:10.844
number that we started out with,
saying the benchmark was 9.9

00:39:10.844 --> 00:39:16.670
but net of fees the managers on
average only lost thirty basis

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:20.703
points--or .3%--you'd say,
well that's a game I don't mind

00:39:20.703 --> 00:39:23.307
playing.
Then if you adjust for

00:39:23.307 --> 00:39:28.188
survivorship bias,
you end up concluding that the

00:39:28.188 --> 00:39:33.679
deficit wasn't .3% but the
deficit was actually 2%.

00:39:33.679 --> 00:39:36.658
In a world where,
if you could win by a

00:39:36.658 --> 00:39:40.500
percentage point or two relative
to the market,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:45.500
to have the average be minus
two full percentage points is

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.784
pretty daunting.
That's the kind of issue with

00:39:49.784 --> 00:39:54.633
survivorship bias and backfill
bias in the relatively

00:39:54.633 --> 00:39:59.110
established asset class of
domestic equities.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:03.881
The problem is even more severe
when you look at something

00:40:03.881 --> 00:40:08.150
that's relatively new,
like the hedge fund world.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:11.648
Now, why is that?
Well, if hedge funds first

00:40:11.648 --> 00:40:17.067
became mainstream maybe fifteen
years ago, then what are you

00:40:17.067 --> 00:40:22.009
looking at in terms of history?
The only history that you would

00:40:22.009 --> 00:40:25.413
have had fifteen years ago would
have been those funds that

00:40:25.413 --> 00:40:29.798
produced great returns,
so it's all identified after

00:40:29.798 --> 00:40:32.802
the fact.
At least in the domestic equity

00:40:32.802 --> 00:40:36.702
world you've got a pretty stable
base that you were looking at

00:40:36.702 --> 00:40:40.615
ten years ago,
so the survivorship bias and

00:40:40.615 --> 00:40:46.771
the backfill bias would be much,
much more of a problem in the

00:40:46.771 --> 00:40:50.898
hedge fund world.
Burt Malkiel who wrote a book

00:40:50.898 --> 00:40:54.097
called A Random Walk Down
Wall Street,

00:40:54.097 --> 00:40:58.095
which if it's not on your
reading list you ought to pick

00:40:58.095 --> 00:41:02.530
up and take a look at because
it's really fun to read but it's

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:06.614
also extremely insightful,
took a look at survivorship

00:41:06.614 --> 00:41:09.610
bias and backfill bias in the
hedge fund world.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:17.724
He looked at a group of hedge
funds that numbered 331 in 1996

00:41:17.724 --> 00:41:26.110
and by 2004, eight years later,
75% of them had disappeared.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:32.796
Looking at this particular
group, he estimated survivorship

00:41:32.796 --> 00:41:39.252
bias to be 4.4% per year and
backfill bias to be 7.3% per

00:41:39.252 --> 00:41:42.917
year.
So, we're talking about a group

00:41:42.917 --> 00:41:47.663
of funds that in aggregate
probably produced somewhere in

00:41:47.663 --> 00:41:52.494
the low teens returns and he's
got 11.7% per year combined

00:41:52.494 --> 00:41:55.969
survivorship bias and backfill
bias.

00:41:55.969 --> 00:41:59.951
Roger Ibbotson took a look at a
larger group of

00:41:59.951 --> 00:42:04.365
funds--3,500--funds over a
ten-year period and found

00:42:04.365 --> 00:42:09.471
survivorship bias at 2.9% per
year and backfill bias at 4.6%

00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:12.291
per year.
So, huge amounts of

00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:16.617
institutional funds and
individual funds are going into

00:42:16.617 --> 00:42:20.776
this hedge fund world.
You look at the returns that

00:42:20.776 --> 00:42:25.320
are reported for hedge funds in
aggregate--they're generally

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:29.710
12%, 13%, 14% per year for the
last five or ten years.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:34.467
In the case of Burt Malkiel's
data, more than 11% per year and

00:42:34.467 --> 00:42:37.510
in the case of Roger Ibbotson's
data,

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:43.281
between 7% and 8% per year of
those returns can be explained

00:42:43.281 --> 00:42:47.880
either by backfill bias or
survivorship bias.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:51.911
If you subtract those numbers
from the reported numbers,

00:42:51.911 --> 00:42:56.382
the returns that the investors
that were actually investing in

00:42:56.382 --> 00:43:00.853
the funds that are defined as
part of the universe at the time

00:43:00.853 --> 00:43:04.354
are low,
maybe mid-single digits--far

00:43:04.354 --> 00:43:09.303
less than people would expect
for the amount of risk that

00:43:09.303 --> 00:43:14.782
they're taking to be exposed to
this particular group of active

00:43:14.782 --> 00:43:18.425
managers.
The final point that I want to

00:43:18.425 --> 00:43:23.156
make with respect to security
selection actually is a little

00:43:23.156 --> 00:43:26.203
bit different.
It has to do with the degree of

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:28.792
opportunity.
This is once you've decided

00:43:28.792 --> 00:43:32.419
that you're going to be an
active manager and try and

00:43:32.419 --> 00:43:34.929
pursue market beating
strategies,

00:43:34.929 --> 00:43:37.485
how do you decide where it is
that you want to spend your time

00:43:37.485 --> 00:43:39.456
and energy?
Now, I think it's logical that

00:43:39.456 --> 00:43:42.403
if you're going to try and beat
the markets, you'd want to beat

00:43:42.403 --> 00:43:44.780
the markets where the
opportunity was greatest.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:46.070
Where's the opportunity
greatest?

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:48.755
The opportunity's greatest
where assets are least

00:43:48.755 --> 00:43:51.098
efficiently priced.
How do you figure out where

00:43:51.098 --> 00:43:52.699
things are least efficiently
priced?

00:43:52.699 --> 00:43:56.538
Well unfortunately,
financial economists don't have

00:43:56.538 --> 00:43:59.840
any direct measures of market
efficiency,

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.699
but I think there's a story
that you can tell about groups

00:44:04.699 --> 00:44:09.986
of active manager returns that
will help point you toward those

00:44:09.986 --> 00:44:14.420
asset classes that are least
efficiently priced.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:18.514
If an asset class has
constituents that are

00:44:18.514 --> 00:44:23.387
efficiently priced,
then it's very hard to generate

00:44:23.387 --> 00:44:26.248
excess returns.
As a matter of fact,

00:44:26.248 --> 00:44:28.416
if things were perfectly
efficiently priced,

00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:30.987
there wouldn't be any
opportunity to generate excess

00:44:30.987 --> 00:44:34.011
returns and if you make active
bets--if you make bets against

00:44:34.011 --> 00:44:37.440
the market--then whether you win
or lose has to do with luck.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:40.651
How are managers going to
behave in an asset class where

00:44:40.651 --> 00:44:43.663
things are efficiently priced?
Well, they're not going to make

00:44:43.663 --> 00:44:46.114
big bets, right?
If they do make big bets maybe

00:44:46.114 --> 00:44:48.850
they get lucky once,
or twice, or three times,

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.829
but ultimately their luck is
going to run out.

00:44:51.829 --> 00:44:54.233
And when their luck runs out,
they'll post bad results and

00:44:54.233 --> 00:44:56.219
get fired.
How do you stay in business?

00:44:56.219 --> 00:45:00.239
You stay in business by looking
a lot like the market.

00:45:00.239 --> 00:45:07.179
What market might be
efficiently priced?

00:45:07.179 --> 00:45:10.437
The bond markets,
in general, and the

00:45:10.437 --> 00:45:16.320
high-quality bonds in particular
are probably easiest to value.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.180
It's all about math.
The government bond,

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.550
you don't have to worry about
default.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:28.752
Generally, you don't have to
worry about optionality or call

00:45:28.752 --> 00:45:32.618
provisions and so it's math.
You're given coupon payments

00:45:32.618 --> 00:45:35.582
every six months and then,
when the bond matures,

00:45:35.582 --> 00:45:39.414
you get your money back.
So there's not a lot of room in

00:45:39.414 --> 00:45:43.604
the government bond market or
other high-quality bond markets

00:45:43.604 --> 00:45:48.144
to generate excess returns.
How about the other end of the

00:45:48.144 --> 00:45:51.325
spectrum?
The other end of the spectrum

00:45:51.325 --> 00:45:54.670
is a market that is very hard to
define.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:57.423
As a matter of fact,
there might not even be a

00:45:57.423 --> 00:46:01.217
benchmark against which you can
measure results and you'd think

00:46:01.217 --> 00:46:06.097
about the venture capital world.
How do you hug the market in

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:09.150
the venture capital world?
You can't;

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:12.984
it's very idiosyncratic.
If you're doing early-stage

00:46:12.984 --> 00:46:16.211
venture investing,
you're backing entrepreneurs

00:46:16.211 --> 00:46:20.070
and ideas and they're operating
out of their garage.

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:23.761
I mean, this romantic notion of
what goes on in Silicon Valley

00:46:23.761 --> 00:46:27.028
actually still holds true in a
lot of cases but there's

00:46:27.028 --> 00:46:30.520
absolutely no way,
as a venture capital investor,

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.690
you could index the venture
capital market.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:39.427
If you look at the behavior of
groups of active managers and

00:46:39.427 --> 00:46:44.423
the dispersion of returns,
I think it gives you some idea

00:46:44.423 --> 00:46:49.122
of what the efficiency is with
which assets in these individual

00:46:49.122 --> 00:46:53.171
assets classes are priced.
Just as I foreshadowed,

00:46:53.171 --> 00:46:57.679
if you look at the difference
between the first and third

00:46:57.679 --> 00:47:01.865
quartile in the bond
market--these are active returns

00:47:01.865 --> 00:47:05.640
over a ten-year period,
again ending June 30,2005--and

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.275
the fixed income market,
the difference between first

00:47:08.275 --> 00:47:10.909
and third quartile is a half a
percent per annum.

00:47:10.909 --> 00:47:16.840
That's an incredibly tight
distribution of returns.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:24.619
Half of the returns are within
a spread of a half-percent.

00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:28.303
Then as you move out to the
equity markets where it's harder

00:47:28.303 --> 00:47:30.800
to price things as
efficiently--large-cap

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.860
stocks--there are two-fold
percentage points,

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:37.978
first to third quartile.
Small-cap stocks are tougher to

00:47:37.978 --> 00:47:41.800
price than large-cap stocks,
so there's a 4.7% differential,

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:46.367
first to third quartile.
The hedge fund world is 7.1%

00:47:46.367 --> 00:47:51.699
first to third quartile,
real estate 9.3% per annum,

00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:55.545
leveraged buyouts 13.7% per
annum--this is over a ten-year

00:47:55.545 --> 00:47:59.188
period, so now we're starting to
talk about some pretty

00:47:59.188 --> 00:48:02.600
significant dispersion.
Of course, in the venture

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.464
capital world,
the least efficiently priced of

00:48:05.464 --> 00:48:08.257
all,
there's a 43.2% differential

00:48:08.257 --> 00:48:12.449
between the top quartile and the
bottom quartile.

00:48:12.449 --> 00:48:16.795
If I'm going to be active in
terms of managing my portfolio,

00:48:16.795 --> 00:48:20.919
should I spend my time and
energy trying to beat the bond

00:48:20.919 --> 00:48:23.023
market?
Where even if you can find

00:48:23.023 --> 00:48:25.659
somebody who's going to be a
first quartile manager,

00:48:25.659 --> 00:48:28.545
there's almost no difference
between the first quartile

00:48:28.545 --> 00:48:30.630
return and the third quartile
return.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:34.314
Or should I spend my time and
energy trying to find the top

00:48:34.314 --> 00:48:36.727
quartile bond,
top quartile real estate

00:48:36.727 --> 00:48:38.750
manager,
or buyout manager,

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.102
or venture capital manager?
I think the answer is pretty

00:48:42.102 --> 00:48:44.824
obvious.
You want to spend your time and

00:48:44.824 --> 00:48:48.493
energy pursuing the most
inefficiently priced asset

00:48:48.493 --> 00:48:52.675
classes because there's an
enormous reward for identifying

00:48:52.675 --> 00:48:56.710
the top quartile venture
capitalist and almost no reward

00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:01.920
for being in the top quartile of
the high-quality bond universe.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.906
The overall conclusions are
that, with respect to asset

00:49:05.906 --> 00:49:10.336
allocation, you want to create
an equity-oriented diversified

00:49:10.336 --> 00:49:13.566
portfolio.
With regard to market timing,

00:49:13.566 --> 00:49:17.597
you don't want to do it.
And with respect to securities

00:49:17.597 --> 00:49:21.730
selection, you want to consider
your skills and you want to

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:25.792
consider the efficiency of
markets when you're making your

00:49:25.792 --> 00:49:30.138
decisions as to whether or not
to pursue passive management or

00:49:30.138 --> 00:49:35.312
active management.
Where did this lead us in terms

00:49:35.312 --> 00:49:40.479
of Yale's portfolio?
Our current portfolio has 11%

00:49:40.479 --> 00:49:46.119
allocated to domestic equities,
15% to foreign equities,

00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:49.630
and 4% to bonds,
so traditional marketable

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:52.969
securities account for 30% of
assets.

00:49:52.969 --> 00:49:57.669
The absolute return portfolio,
which is a group of hedge funds

00:49:57.669 --> 00:50:01.368
that strive to produce
fundamentally uncorrelated

00:50:01.368 --> 00:50:04.449
returns, accounts for 23% of
assets;

00:50:04.449 --> 00:50:08.264
our real assets portfolio,
which includes timber,

00:50:08.264 --> 00:50:10.489
oil and gas,
and real estate,

00:50:10.489 --> 00:50:13.349
amounts to 28% of the
portfolio;

00:50:13.349 --> 00:50:17.216
and private equity,
which includes venture capital

00:50:17.216 --> 00:50:20.530
and leveraged buyouts,
is 19% of assets.

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:23.943
So, 70% of the portfolio is in
absolute return,

00:50:23.943 --> 00:50:25.947
real assets,
private equity,

00:50:25.947 --> 00:50:31.711
alternatives--broadly defined.
If you take this portfolio and

00:50:31.711 --> 00:50:37.653
apply the tests that we
articulated at the outset of the

00:50:37.653 --> 00:50:41.543
lecture today--equity
orientation and

00:50:41.543 --> 00:50:48.349
diversification--the portfolio
is clearly equity-oriented;

00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:52.982
96% of assets are invested in
some type of vehicle that we

00:50:52.982 --> 00:50:56.884
would expect to generate
equity-like returns over

00:50:56.884 --> 00:51:01.754
reasonably long periods of time.
In terms of diversification,

00:51:01.754 --> 00:51:05.852
there are half a dozen asset
classes with weights that range

00:51:05.852 --> 00:51:10.100
between 4% and 28%.
So, if you just came down and

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:16.010
took a look at that and compared
it to 50% in domestic stocks,

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:20.502
40% in domestic bonds and cash,
and 10% in a smattering of

00:51:20.502 --> 00:51:23.970
alternatives,
you'd say that this is really a

00:51:23.970 --> 00:51:26.113
much,
much better diversified

00:51:26.113 --> 00:51:28.980
portfolio than the one with
which we started.

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:37.369
The results have been okay.
Over the past twenty years,

00:51:37.369 --> 00:51:42.898
we've generated 15.6% per annum
return, but that headline number

00:51:42.898 --> 00:51:48.075
obviously has a lot to do with
the equity orientation of the

00:51:48.075 --> 00:51:52.551
portfolio but doesn't describe
the importance of the

00:51:52.551 --> 00:51:57.824
diversification.
We've had no down years since

00:51:57.824 --> 00:52:04.445
1987--1987 that was the crash in
October that I talked about

00:52:04.445 --> 00:52:06.854
earlier.
In that year,

00:52:06.854 --> 00:52:12.276
we were early on in terms of
diversifying the portfolio--we'd

00:52:12.276 --> 00:52:17.337
only been working on that
program for two years--and even

00:52:17.337 --> 00:52:20.062
so,
the negative return was less

00:52:20.062 --> 00:52:23.280
than 1%, so it was a modest
negative return.

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:26.819
Probably a more important test
of the portfolio was what

00:52:26.819 --> 00:52:30.809
happened around the collapse of
the Internet bubble in 2000.

00:52:30.809 --> 00:52:36.377
In the year ending June 30,2001
and 2002, returns for

00:52:36.377 --> 00:52:42.586
institutional investors were on
average negative in both of

00:52:42.586 --> 00:52:48.689
those years and actually in
every year since 1987 Yale has

00:52:48.689 --> 00:52:53.928
had positive returns.
The equity orientation drove

00:52:53.928 --> 00:52:57.955
the returns but the
diversification allowed us to

00:52:57.955 --> 00:53:01.730
deliver those returns in a
stable fashion,

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:06.230
which is incredibly important
for an institution like Yale

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:11.519
that requires a steady supply of
funds to finance its operations.

00:53:11.519 --> 00:53:15.035
When I started in 1985,
the distribution to the

00:53:15.035 --> 00:53:17.710
operating budget was $45
million.

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:23.433
That represented 10% of
revenues and that was the lowest

00:53:23.433 --> 00:53:28.532
level for the entire
century--the entire twentieth

00:53:28.532 --> 00:53:35.360
century--10% of revenues.
The amount that we're spending

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:43.489
for the year ending June 30,2008
is $843 million--that represents

00:53:43.489 --> 00:53:50.730
37% of revenues--and we're
projecting expenditures for the

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:58.161
following year of $1.15 billion.
The results have been really

00:53:58.161 --> 00:54:02.574
quite extraordinary.
My favorite way to measure the

00:54:02.574 --> 00:54:07.382
results is actually to compare
what Yale achieved with what we

00:54:07.382 --> 00:54:12.347
would have had if we would have
just experienced average returns

00:54:12.347 --> 00:54:16.497
over the past twenty years.
The difference between the

00:54:16.497 --> 00:54:20.377
average return for colleges and
universities and Yale's returns

00:54:20.377 --> 00:54:24.320
has added $14.4 billion dollars
to the University's coffers.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.800
Whether you measure it in terms
of dollars of value added or in

00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:33.719
terms of returns,
Yale has the best record among

00:54:33.719 --> 00:54:37.599
colleges and universities for
the past two decades.

00:54:37.599 --> 00:54:41.241
So with that,
I'd be happy to take any

00:54:41.241 --> 00:54:50.198
questions that you might have.
Student: [inaudible]

00:54:50.198 --> 00:55:00.739
Professor David Swensen:
The question is,

00:55:00.739 --> 00:55:05.386
if a group of Yalies started a
hedge fund, what would they have

00:55:05.386 --> 00:55:08.460
to do to convince me to invest
in them?

00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:12.825
One of the things that we've
done over the years has been

00:55:12.825 --> 00:55:17.425
open-minded about backing groups
that don't have traditional

00:55:17.425 --> 00:55:21.344
investment credentials.
If you went to a corporate

00:55:21.344 --> 00:55:25.391
pension plan or a state pension
manager, they'd have a very

00:55:25.391 --> 00:55:29.089
bureaucratic process--probably a
fifty or hundred page

00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:32.159
questionnaire that you had to
fill out,

00:55:32.159 --> 00:55:35.258
you'd have to deal with
consultants, and you'd have to

00:55:35.258 --> 00:55:38.532
have ten years or five years
worth of audited performance

00:55:38.532 --> 00:55:44.399
statistics.
We tend to think that that's

00:55:44.399 --> 00:55:53.309
not the richest pond within
which we should fish.

00:55:53.309 --> 00:55:56.648
We think that the more
interesting investment

00:55:56.648 --> 00:56:00.821
opportunities are kind of
outside of the mainstream with

00:56:00.821 --> 00:56:04.993
more entrepreneurial firms and
ones that might have less

00:56:04.993 --> 00:56:09.846
traditional backgrounds.
That said, we just don't take

00:56:09.846 --> 00:56:14.909
flyers on people that we think
have interesting resumes;

00:56:14.909 --> 00:56:20.487
we want to have a demonstrated
ability to operate in the

00:56:20.487 --> 00:56:26.166
markets that the investment
management firm is suggesting

00:56:26.166 --> 00:56:29.118
that we back.
I would say,

00:56:29.118 --> 00:56:34.542
part of what we look at are
hard quantitative factors,

00:56:34.542 --> 00:56:40.274
but probably more important
than the numbers are the soft

00:56:40.274 --> 00:56:45.610
qualitative attributes.
It's almost like what you

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:49.860
looked for in a Boy Scout or a
Girl Scout.

00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.309
You want people of high
integrity.

00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:56.760
You want people of
unimpeachable character.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:01.170
You want people that are smart,
incredibly hard-working.

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:06.122
And in the investment world,
you want somebody who's really

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:10.049
obsessed with the
markets--somebody who doesn't

00:57:10.049 --> 00:57:14.574
define winning by getting as
rich as they possibly can

00:57:14.574 --> 00:57:17.260
because,
if that's their goal,

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:21.304
there are all sorts of things
that they can do to get rich

00:57:21.304 --> 00:57:25.277
that don't have anything to do
with generating investment

00:57:25.277 --> 00:57:27.760
returns.
We want people who are

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:32.089
maniacally focused on beating
the markets, generating superior

00:57:32.089 --> 00:57:35.948
investment returns.
That's an incredibly important

00:57:35.948 --> 00:57:38.629
distinction because,
think about it,

00:57:38.629 --> 00:57:41.539
if what you want to do is get
rich,

00:57:41.539 --> 00:57:44.495
you can put together a
reasonable investment record and

00:57:44.495 --> 00:57:46.739
then raise staggering amounts of
money.

00:57:46.739 --> 00:57:49.050
Size is the enemy of
performance.

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:52.942
So that staggering amount of
money then impairs the fund

00:57:52.942 --> 00:57:57.260
managers' ability to continue
generating excellent returns,

00:57:57.260 --> 00:58:00.263
but they can stay in business
and collect the fees that they

00:58:00.263 --> 00:58:02.349
get for having this huge pile of
money.

00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:07.199
The type of manager we're
looking for is somebody who

00:58:07.199 --> 00:58:12.701
strives to generate excellent
returns and they'll frequently

00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:18.389
raise modest amounts of money
and close to new investors,

00:58:18.389 --> 00:58:22.719
measuring their success by
beating the market not by

00:58:22.719 --> 00:58:26.710
generating huge flows of fees
for themselves.

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:31.710
It's a combination of looking
at kind of objective attributes

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:36.043
and subjective characteristics
and finding people who

00:58:36.043 --> 00:58:40.710
ultimately will be good partners
for the University.

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:44.880
Student: How has Yale's
endowment dealt with the falling

00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.735
house prices?
You said, if we invest in real

00:58:47.735 --> 00:58:50.749
estate [inaudible]
Professor David Swensen:

00:58:50.749 --> 00:58:54.809
The question is how we've dealt
with decline in housing prices.

00:58:54.809 --> 00:59:00.799
We don't have really much of
any direct exposure to

00:59:00.799 --> 00:59:05.829
homebuilders or to the housing
industry.

00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:09.230
Most of our real estate
exposure is

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:15.030
institutional--acquisitions of
office buildings--largely in

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:19.630
major markets--central business
districts.

00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:24.170
So, you'd find Yale with
interests in office buildings in

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:28.627
New York, Washington D.C.,
Chicago, San Francisco,

00:59:28.627 --> 00:59:32.432
Los Angeles,
some in secondary markets as

00:59:32.432 --> 00:59:38.519
well, but predominantly in large
metropolitan downtown areas.

00:59:38.519 --> 00:59:44.351
There are also some hotel
investments, retail properties,

00:59:44.351 --> 00:59:49.349
smattering of industrial
properties--not a lot of

00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:54.727
exposure to individual houses.
The only way that we would get

00:59:54.727 --> 00:59:57.545
that occasionally would be
through some sort of

00:59:57.545 --> 01:00:01.181
lot-financing activities,
but that's not something that

01:00:01.181 --> 01:00:04.586
I've generally liked.
I don't think the housing

01:00:04.586 --> 01:00:08.479
industry, in general,
is a good place to be because

01:00:08.479 --> 01:00:11.750
of its, sometimes,
violent cyclicality.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:16.275
We did have a large,
short position in subprime

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:21.785
mortgage-backed securities,
which has paid off enormously

01:00:21.785 --> 01:00:27.393
for the University and really
helped protect assets in the

01:00:27.393 --> 01:00:31.611
past nine months or a year.
I think that,

01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:36.018
generally speaking--and Bob
Shiller can speak to this with a

01:00:36.018 --> 01:00:39.679
lot more authority than I
can--this bubble was not

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:43.340
something that should have
surprised people.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:49.385
I thought the University
positioned itself well to take

01:00:49.385 --> 01:00:55.878
advantage of this really not
surprising collapse in housing

01:00:55.878 --> 01:00:59.530
prices.
Isn't that market timing?

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:05.429
I mean, it all depends on your
perspective.

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:10.228
I think market timing,
as I've defined it,

01:01:10.228 --> 01:01:16.666
has to do with short-term
deviations from your long-term

01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:21.466
policy targets.
I mentioned that our domestic

01:01:21.466 --> 01:01:25.744
equity target was 11%.
If I came to the office next

01:01:25.744 --> 01:01:30.613
week and decided domestic stocks
were too high--I want to move

01:01:30.613 --> 01:01:35.402
that target down to 8%--in the
way that I've described market

01:01:35.402 --> 01:01:38.807
timing,
that would be a market timing

01:01:38.807 --> 01:01:42.519
move and we're very careful not
to do that.

01:01:42.519 --> 01:01:46.845
We establish these targets,
we review them once a year,

01:01:46.845 --> 01:01:49.889
we don't make changes in many
years,

01:01:49.889 --> 01:01:54.574
they're quite stable,
and when we do move them we

01:01:54.574 --> 01:01:59.650
don't move them by a lot.
That doesn't mean that we don't

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:04.527
manage the portfolio actively.
So, if we see areas that are

01:02:04.527 --> 01:02:09.403
particularly interesting,
we're more than happy to deploy

01:02:09.403 --> 01:02:14.453
capital to take advantage of
what we think are cheap assets

01:02:14.453 --> 01:02:18.632
or expensive assets.
We made a big bet against

01:02:18.632 --> 01:02:23.758
Internet stocks in 1999 and 2000
that was very profitable for the

01:02:23.758 --> 01:02:26.525
University.
As I mentioned,

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:33.215
there was a big bet that credit
spreads, both in mortgages and

01:02:33.215 --> 01:02:37.003
in corporates,
were way too narrow in the past

01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:40.725
couple of years and that--we
thought that if they were priced

01:02:40.725 --> 01:02:44.510
rationally those spreads would
widen and we put ourselves in a

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:48.748
position to profit from that.
Today, we're looking at

01:02:48.748 --> 01:02:52.449
opportunities in distressed
securities.

01:02:52.449 --> 01:02:58.097
A lot of these loans that were
made in 2005 and 2006 and early

01:02:58.097 --> 01:03:02.162
in 2007 were made at very,
very narrow spreads and there

01:03:02.162 --> 01:03:04.550
are opportunities out there to
buy bank loans,

01:03:04.550 --> 01:03:08.859
which are at the very top of
the capital structure,

01:03:08.859 --> 01:03:14.030
that we believe will be money
good for prices in the '80s.

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:18.672
If it turns out that they're
money good, you get your

01:03:18.672 --> 01:03:23.851
interest and you get $1 for
every $.85 that you invested in

01:03:23.851 --> 01:03:26.591
a few years.
If markets offer us

01:03:26.591 --> 01:03:29.560
opportunities,
we're more than happy to take

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.010
advantage of them.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:41.943
So, we will make valuation bets.
We'll look at

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:45.307
things--sectors--say they're
cheap or expensive and exploit

01:03:45.307 --> 01:03:48.654
the opportunity;
but at least in terms of how I

01:03:48.654 --> 01:03:52.170
define market timing,
it wouldn't be included in

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:56.059
that--it wouldn't be included in
that definition.

01:03:56.059 --> 01:04:06.154
Student: [inaudible]
Professor David Swensen:

01:04:06.154 --> 01:04:14.683
The first question is,
what's the beta of the Yale

01:04:14.683 --> 01:04:19.326
portfolio?
That's not a way that we really

01:04:19.326 --> 01:04:22.528
think about it,
but I do believe that the risk

01:04:22.528 --> 01:04:26.585
level of the University's
portfolio is really quite low in

01:04:26.585 --> 01:04:30.784
statistical terms--much lower
than the risk level that you'd

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:34.413
have if you had a traditional
portfolio dominated by

01:04:34.413 --> 01:04:39.185
marketable securities.
The reason it's low is that we

01:04:39.185 --> 01:04:43.717
do have, what I think is,
superior diversification and

01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:47.480
that really lowers the
University's risk.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:50.263
A lot of people look at Yale's
portfolio and say,

01:04:50.263 --> 01:04:53.625
oh it's risky because you've
got venture capital and you've

01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:56.988
got timber--we have all these
things that you might believe

01:04:56.988 --> 01:04:59.974
are individually risky,
but part of the magic of

01:04:59.974 --> 01:05:03.235
diversification is if you've got
things that are individually

01:05:03.235 --> 01:05:06.280
risky but they're not well
correlated one to another,

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.650
the overall portfolio risk
level is quite low.

01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:15.139
I believe that we have quite a
low risk portfolio.

01:05:15.139 --> 01:05:19.595
The second part of the question
dealt with the changes in our

01:05:19.595 --> 01:05:24.051
exposure to foreign assets and
that's an area that we've been

01:05:24.051 --> 01:05:27.917
very interested in.
Our foreign exposure is not

01:05:27.917 --> 01:05:31.353
limited to the marketable
security exposure,

01:05:31.353 --> 01:05:34.710
which I cited as being 15% of
the fund,

01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:37.443
but there's foreign exposure in
real estate, there's foreign

01:05:37.443 --> 01:05:40.137
exposure in leverage buyouts,
there's foreign exposure in

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:43.280
venture capital.
It's something that permeates

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.683
the portfolio and,
I think, provides really

01:05:46.683 --> 01:05:50.897
interesting investment
opportunities because a lot of

01:05:50.897 --> 01:05:55.516
the foreign markets are less
efficiently priced than those

01:05:55.516 --> 01:06:00.719
that you find in the U.S.
And I think the fact that our

01:06:00.719 --> 01:06:04.949
foreign investments are
generally denominated in

01:06:04.949 --> 01:06:10.170
currencies other than the dollar
is also attractive--a good

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:13.949
diversifying tool for the
university.

01:06:13.949 --> 01:06:19.747
Student: [inaudible]
Professor David Swensen:

01:06:19.747 --> 01:06:25.545
The question was whether we were
looking to take more short

01:06:25.545 --> 01:06:31.843
positions as the economy appears
to be moving into recession and

01:06:31.843 --> 01:06:37.841
I guess the second part of the
question was how do you remain

01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:42.239
bullish in this kind of
environment.

01:06:42.239 --> 01:06:46.475
I think the best answer to that
is a quote from one of my

01:06:46.475 --> 01:06:49.878
contemporaries,
who I think is one of the best

01:06:49.878 --> 01:06:54.528
investment managers out there.
A guy named Seth Klarman,

01:06:54.528 --> 01:06:58.186
who works at a fund in Boston
called Baupost,

01:06:58.186 --> 01:07:02.592
said that what he does is
worries top-down and invests

01:07:02.592 --> 01:07:05.331
bottom-up.
I read The Wall Street

01:07:05.331 --> 01:07:09.090
Journal every morning and I
worry about the credit crisis,

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.752
and I worry about credit cards,
and I worry about auto loans,

01:07:11.752 --> 01:07:13.349
and I worry about corporate
loans,

01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:16.292
and I worry about the solvency
of the banking system,

01:07:16.292 --> 01:07:19.801
and then I go to work and I try
and find the best opportunities

01:07:19.801 --> 01:07:24.859
that I possibly can.
So, the worrying top-down helps

01:07:24.859 --> 01:07:31.662
because you don't want to put
yourself in a position where

01:07:31.662 --> 01:07:37.630
you're going to get hurt by some
adverse macro,

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:43.451
sectoral circumstance,
but there's no way that you can

01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:50.041
take $22.5 billion dollars and
be in the markets when they're

01:07:50.041 --> 01:07:55.422
attractive and out of the
markets when they're not

01:07:55.422 --> 01:07:58.329
attractive.
So you just say,

01:07:58.329 --> 01:08:02.162
okay fine, this is the macro
circumstance that we're dealing

01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:05.800
with and we're going to do
absolutely the best job we can

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.748
identifying individual,
specific, bottom-up

01:08:09.748 --> 01:08:13.670
opportunities to deploy the
funds.

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:27.351
Student: [inaudible]
Professor David Swensen:

01:08:27.351 --> 01:08:40.325
Well, I think one of the
questions---the question is how

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:52.119
can you successfully invest in a
market where,

01:08:52.119 --> 01:08:56.180
I guess, people say you might
catch a falling knife.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:01.208
You buy something that's down
30% but it's got another 50% to

01:09:01.208 --> 01:09:05.649
go and I think it just has to do
with time horizon.

01:09:05.649 --> 01:09:08.372
Particularly if you have a
value orientation,

01:09:08.372 --> 01:09:12.995
you tend to buy things early.
If you bought them with a good,

01:09:12.995 --> 01:09:18.057
sound, fundamental investment
case and prices are down from

01:09:18.057 --> 01:09:23.173
where you made your purchase,
have enough dry powder so that

01:09:23.173 --> 01:09:27.588
you can purchase some more at
the now lower price but have

01:09:27.588 --> 01:09:32.467
enough confidence in your thesis
to be able to hold the position

01:09:32.467 --> 01:09:37.114
through the decline and wait for
the markets to recognize the

01:09:37.114 --> 01:09:41.916
value that you identified.
I think one of the most

01:09:41.916 --> 01:09:47.386
pervasive problems in the
financial markets is investment

01:09:47.386 --> 01:09:52.480
with too short a time horizon.
The fact that people look at

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:55.554
quarterly returns of mutual
funds is incredibly

01:09:55.554 --> 01:09:58.365
dysfunctional.
I mean, there's no way that you

01:09:58.365 --> 01:10:01.663
can expect somebody quarter in
and quarter out or month in and

01:10:01.663 --> 01:10:03.880
month out to produce superior
returns.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:08.920
There just aren't pricing
anomalies that are significant

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:14.144
that are going to resolve
themselves in a matter of months

01:10:14.144 --> 01:10:18.359
or weeks and so it's a silly
game to play.

01:10:18.359 --> 01:10:21.468
By extending your time horizon
to three years,

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.609
or four years,
or five years,

01:10:23.609 --> 01:10:26.984
it opens up a whole host of
investment opportunities that

01:10:26.984 --> 01:10:30.420
aren't available to people that
are playing this silly,

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:34.546
short-term game.
So, it's not a big deal to buy

01:10:34.546 --> 01:10:39.015
something at a price that you
think is attractive,

01:10:39.015 --> 01:10:42.390
have it go down 20,
or 30, or 40%;

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:45.271
that ought to be almost a
positive thing because you get a

01:10:45.271 --> 01:10:47.949
chance to add to the position of
even lower prices,

01:10:47.949 --> 01:10:51.583
as long as you're ultimately
right that sometime in the

01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:54.679
three-, or four-,
or five-year time horizon you

01:10:54.679 --> 01:10:58.649
have your investment thesis
proves out and you're ultimately

01:10:58.649 --> 01:11:01.609
able to exit the position at a
profit.

01:11:01.609 --> 01:11:08.120
Student: [inaudible]
Professor David Swensen:

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.609
The question is about housing
indexes.

01:11:12.609 --> 01:11:15.432
I'll defer those to Bob
Shiller-- I couldn't answer a

01:11:15.432 --> 01:11:17.440
question like that in front of
him.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.546
Great, thank you very much.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.650
Prof: Tuesday we ended
with the angry response in the

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.020
colonies to the passage of the
Stamp Act, 1765.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.710
I talked about--I described
Patrick Henry.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.450
We had a first--our famous
Revolution moment number one,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.820
Patrick Henry speaking out in
the Virginia House of Burgesses,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.302
talking about what he
dramatically called his colony's

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:26.584
dying liberty,
and at the very end of the

00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:30.080
lecture I mentioned that in May
of 1765,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.042
the Virginia House of Burgesses
passed some protesting

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:38.230
resolutions ultimately known as
the Virginia Resolves.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.361
I think I said Resolutions on
Tuesday and let's stick with

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.230
Resolves, the Virginia Resolves.
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.823
And the Virginia Resolves
said--There were a number of

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:48.710
different --obviously--resolves
in the Virginia Resolves.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.961
They said that the colonists
had come to Virginia with equal

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:57.809
rights to all British subjects;
that the colonial charter

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.759
confirmed that;
that Virginians had the right

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:05.108
to be governed by their own
legislature;

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:09.289
and that the Virginia
legislature had never forfeited

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.629
its right to impose taxes on the
colony of Virginia.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:14.590
I'll repeat that again.
 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.174
The Virginia Resolves,
May 1765: colonists had come to

00:01:18.174 --> 00:01:21.760
Virginia with equal rights to
all British subjects;

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.400
colonial charters confirmed
that;

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.674
Virginians had the right to be
governed by their own colonial

00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:30.483
legislature;
and the Virginia colonial

00:01:30.483 --> 00:01:35.471
legislature had not forfeited
its right to impose taxes on the

00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:37.269
colony of Virginia.
 

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:40.946
Now the House of Burgesses
passes these resolutions,

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:44.910
but in Virginia they weren't
even published in the local

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.920
newspaper.
 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.390
However, they were published in
Rhode Island.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.662
Okay.
 

00:01:49.662 --> 00:01:51.239
I really don't make this up.
 

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:54.056
I feel like you're going to
accuse me of planting Rhode

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:56.819
Island randomly throughout this
course and I'm not.

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.040
It's--Really it's there all by
itself.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.010
Rhode Island--and why Rhode
Island I can't tell you--but

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.709
indeed by happenstance,
someone in Rhode Island--It

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:05.519
circulates.
 

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:06.500
The resolves are circulating.
 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.520
People are reading them and
they're talking about them,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.325
but it's somebody in Rhode
Island who publishes the

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:14.020
Virginia Resolves in a Rhode
Island newspaper.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.193
However, what this person does
when he publishes these resolves

00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:22.098
is not only publish the ones
that were actually passed,

00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:25.288
but there are two additional
resolves that get published

00:02:25.288 --> 00:02:27.840
right alongside the ones that
were passed.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.014
These were not passed and
possibly weren't really even

00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:33.950
discussed, and they're more
radical than the other

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.910
resolutions.
 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.669
But they're put right alongside
with no differentiation,

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:42.740
and these two unpassed more
radical resolutions say,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.280
quote, "His Majesty's
liege people,

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.019
inhabitants of this colony,
are not bound to yield

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.217
obedience to any law or
ordinance whatsoever designed to

00:02:54.217 --> 00:02:57.270
impose any taxation upon
them."

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.535
Okay.
 

00:02:57.535 --> 00:03:00.455
That's a much bolder statement
than what I just said was

00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:02.580
happening in those Virginia
Resolves.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.086
And then the sort of more
radical unpassed resolution

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:08.650
number two that got published
said,

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.843
that anyone who asserted that
anyone except the Virginia

00:03:12.843 --> 00:03:16.199
Assembly could directly tax
Virginia was,

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:18.930
quote, "an enemy of this,
His Majesty's colony."

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.198
Okay.
 

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.348
Those are two really strong
statements.

00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:23.970
The Virginia House of Burgesses
did not pass those,

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.233
did not resolve those,
but they get published in Rhode

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:29.008
Island right alongside the ones
that were passed and resolved,

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.848
and so they go circulating
throughout the colonies,

00:03:31.848 --> 00:03:35.077
making Virginia look a lot more
radical than it was at that

00:03:35.077 --> 00:03:36.190
particular moment.
 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.935
So news of this sort of new
radical version of the Virginia

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:43.810
Resolves gets spread throughout
the colonies and colonies are

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.910
then inspired to pass resolves
of their own.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.038
So it's another Rhode Island
moment.

00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:54.410
However, it is Massachusetts
that first suggests united

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.199
colonial action.
 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.863
So in June of 1765,
the Massachusetts assembly

00:03:59.863 --> 00:04:04.830
sends a circular letter to all
of the colonial assemblies--

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.288
and a circular letter is kind
of what it sounds like,

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.408
a letter intended to
circulate--to all of the

00:04:10.408 --> 00:04:14.449
colonial assemblies inviting
them to meet in a congress in

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.836
New York in October of 1765,
quote, "to consider of a

00:04:18.836 --> 00:04:22.089
general and united,
dutiful, loyal and humble

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.985
representation of their
condition to His Majesty and the

00:04:25.985 --> 00:04:28.959
parliament and to implore
relief."

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:29.244
Okay.
 

00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:32.089
So it's a united response but
it's also dutiful,

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:34.404
loyal and humble,
so on the one hand the fact

00:04:34.404 --> 00:04:37.247
that there's going to be some
kind of a united colonial

00:04:37.247 --> 00:04:39.509
statement is interesting and
forceful,

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.632
but on the other hand,
dutiful, loyal,

00:04:41.632 --> 00:04:42.149
humble.
 

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:45.490
We're not -- we're not here
declaring independence here.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.572
We're just kind of imploring
relief, making a statement that,

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:51.552
'Excuse us: we are your humble
and obedient subjects and we

00:04:51.552 --> 00:04:54.079
don't really like this;
thank you very much.'

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.430
So it's that kind of a
statement.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.209
Nine colonies responded.
 

00:04:57.209 --> 00:05:00.199
New Hampshire declined to
participate.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.309
Virginia, North Carolina and
Georgia couldn't participate

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:06.473
because their governors didn't
convene their assemblies to

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.134
elect delegates,
so there were no delegates

00:05:09.134 --> 00:05:11.267
elected,
but all in all there were

00:05:11.267 --> 00:05:15.071
twenty-seven men who took part
in what came to be known as the

00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:16.255
Stamp Act Congress.
 

00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:16.879
Right?
 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.937
Easy enough to remember,
the Stamp Act Congress,

00:05:19.937 --> 00:05:22.540
which met for much of October
in 1765.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.540
Okay, the Stamp Act Congress.
 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.913
The Stamp Act Congress was
actually the first of what we're

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:34.365
going to see is a series of
extralegal organizations created

00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:38.966
outside of the regular colonial
political system to resist and

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:43.199
reform British policies --
and so it's a significant

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.819
action on the part of the
colonies.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.473
And ultimately,
the Stamp Act Congress passed a

00:05:49.473 --> 00:05:53.024
series of declarations,
and they kind of echo some of

00:05:53.024 --> 00:05:56.144
the resolutions and declarations
that had been circulating and

00:05:56.144 --> 00:05:59.062
they're going to sound not
drastically different from some

00:05:59.062 --> 00:06:01.723
of the logic that I've been
talking about in the last

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:02.850
lecture or two.
 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.108
And I'll just mention four of
the resolutions passed by the

00:06:06.108 --> 00:06:07.290
Stamp Act Congress.
 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.137
They declared that they owed
their allegiance to the crown

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:15.269
like any British subject;
they declared that they were

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:19.391
entitled to the rights and
liberties of any British

00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:22.675
subject;
they said that British subjects

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:27.120
in the colonies could not be
taxed without their consent;

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.259
and they declared that trial by
jury was the right of every

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.100
British subject in the colonies.
 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.850
So you can see their--really
their statement is saying well,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.014
we're British subjects like any
other British subject and we're

00:06:38.014 --> 00:06:40.565
demanding the rights and
liberties of other British

00:06:40.565 --> 00:06:41.230
subjects.
 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.747
Now it's important to note--the
resolutions are not saying that

00:06:45.747 --> 00:06:50.120
Parliament had no right to
regulate trade in the colonies.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.122
They're just saying that
Parliament cannot directly tax

00:06:53.122 --> 00:06:55.180
the colonies without their
consent.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.202
So again, it's a direct
statement, it's a strong

00:06:58.202 --> 00:07:00.651
statement,
but it's a respectful statement

00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:02.680
and it's not boldly sort of
altering--

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.610
at least in the minds of the
colonists--

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.019
an enormous change of policy.
 

00:07:08.019 --> 00:07:10.468
They're kind of stating what
they think the state of things

00:07:10.468 --> 00:07:10.680
is.
 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.634
So clearly the Stamp Act
Congress is a step toward

00:07:13.634 --> 00:07:16.569
colonial unity;
it's a significant step.

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.971
Now actually I want to add at
this point the answer to a

00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:23.560
question that someone asked at
the end of class on Tuesday,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.540
and he's lurking over there.
 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.552
I think that was you -- yes.
 

00:07:26.552 --> 00:07:28.110
[inaudible]
It was a really good question.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.389
I answer questions--and then I
actually answer them in class.

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.110
It was a really good question,
and the question was did anyone

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:37.646
in Parliament actually oppose
the Stamp Act and if they did

00:07:37.646 --> 00:07:39.050
what was the logic?
 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.041
It's actually a really good
question and although I knew the

00:07:41.041 --> 00:07:42.923
answer was yes,
I couldn't tell you very much

00:07:42.923 --> 00:07:45.786
detail about that yes,
so I went and did a little

00:07:45.786 --> 00:07:47.940
research and it's interesting.
 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.589
Most members of Parliament
assumed that the Stamp Act was,

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:53.029
I suppose you could say
constitutional,

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:54.980
or that it was above-board,
proper,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.610
that there was nothing wrong
with it as far as procedurally--

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.607
and most members of Parliament
assumed that the colonists would

00:08:01.607 --> 00:08:04.699
agree it's constitutional--
above-board--there's nothing

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:07.660
wrong with it as far as the fact
that it exists;

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.160
the Stamp Act is perfectly
proper.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.189
Some members of Parliament,
and not a lot but some,

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:17.067
did admit that maybe Parliament
was treading on dangerous

00:08:17.067 --> 00:08:19.428
ground,
but even these people didn't

00:08:19.428 --> 00:08:22.589
worry about the Stamp Act on
constitutional grounds.

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:23.685
They didn't say,
'Wow.

00:08:23.685 --> 00:08:25.980
I wonder if we have the right
to do this.'

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.307
Rather, they worried that maybe
the colonists were going to be

00:08:29.307 --> 00:08:32.798
unhappy because the Stamp Act
maybe would seem too burdensome.

00:08:32.798 --> 00:08:36.176
Or they worried that maybe the
colonists would think this was

00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:39.610
some kind of an aggressive
display of parliamentary power,

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:44.053
but members of Parliament were
actually not worried about this

00:08:44.053 --> 00:08:48.058
seeming as though it's something
that wasn't proper,

00:08:48.058 --> 00:08:50.294
wasn't allowable,
wasn't supposed to be done

00:08:50.294 --> 00:08:53.048
within the confines of the
British imperial system.

00:08:53.048 --> 00:08:54.594
So basically what you're seeing
here is sort of a version of

00:08:54.594 --> 00:08:56.111
what I've been saying in a
variety of different ways so far

00:08:56.111 --> 00:08:56.610
in this course.
 

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.548
I've been talking about
different mindsets developing,

00:08:59.548 --> 00:09:02.272
and both sides sort of not
necessarily understanding that

00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:04.460
there are different mindsets
evolving here.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.404
What you're seeing here is
basically members of Parliament

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:10.557
just fundamentally not seeing
that the colonists had developed

00:09:10.557 --> 00:09:13.865
a different understanding of the
workings of the British imperial

00:09:13.865 --> 00:09:15.936
system,
and those members who were

00:09:15.936 --> 00:09:18.738
worried about the act,
they were worried about it

00:09:18.738 --> 00:09:22.332
being unpopular or maybe seeming
too strong but they were not

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:25.450
worried about any larger sort of
legal rationale.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.071
As one member put it,--I
thought this was kind of a neat

00:09:28.071 --> 00:09:29.880
quote--
"We are working in the

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.028
dark and the less we do the
better."

00:09:32.028 --> 00:09:34.214
I thought that's a great quote,
because it's basically a Member

00:09:34.214 --> 00:09:35.870
of Parliament saying,
'I'm not entirely sure.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.509
We don't really know what we're
doing,

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:39.658
and we don't really know how
they're going to respond,

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:41.958
so we actually need to be
careful with what we're doing

00:09:41.958 --> 00:09:44.600
because we just don't know what
the response is going to be.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.389
They're not--They may not like
it.'

00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:49.711
There actually was only one
Member of Parliament who was a

00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:52.631
planter in the West Indies,
one guy who predicted,

00:09:52.631 --> 00:09:55.509
'I think this Stamp Act is
going to produce discord and

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:57.110
confusion in the colonies.'
 

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.524
Right?
 

00:09:57.524 --> 00:10:01.187
One guy, so probably afterwards
he was the guy saying,

00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:01.808
'Yeah.
 

00:10:01.808 --> 00:10:03.624
I told you.' [laughs]
'You should have listened to

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:03.809
me.
 

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:05.750
I told you. I knew.'
 

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.019
Okay.
 

00:10:06.019 --> 00:10:08.120
So that's the answer to that
question.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.355
It's a really good question
because I had just never looked

00:10:10.355 --> 00:10:11.548
that up in any detail before.
 

00:10:11.548 --> 00:10:11.885
Okay.
 

00:10:11.885 --> 00:10:15.860
So--So far we've largely been
talking about speechifying,

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.759
paper-pushing,
resolves, declarations,

00:10:19.759 --> 00:10:23.604
newspaper announcements,
but in Boston we're now about

00:10:23.604 --> 00:10:26.070
to see some physical resistance.
 

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.698
Because there,
some radicals decided no more

00:10:29.698 --> 00:10:31.048
words--action.
 

00:10:31.048 --> 00:10:34.514
And these Boston radicals,
as you're about to see,

00:10:34.514 --> 00:10:37.769
they deployed a long-held
colonial tradition of

00:10:37.769 --> 00:10:38.830
resistance.
 

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.730
They basically planned a mob
action.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.863
Now it's important to note that
mobs in early America weren't

00:10:45.863 --> 00:10:48.412
sort of wild,
violent, out-of-control,

00:10:48.412 --> 00:10:51.649
'oh, my gosh,
it's a riot' kind of actions.

00:10:51.649 --> 00:10:54.413
In a way they were sort of part
of the political system,

00:10:54.413 --> 00:10:57.176
something that people were
supposed to do when they felt

00:10:57.176 --> 00:10:57.830
outraged.
 

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:00.759
It was sort of a way of venting
popular protest,

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:04.440
and usually early American mobs
were pretty conservative.

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.613
They were usually focused on
protecting the good of the

00:11:07.613 --> 00:11:10.787
community from things like
unfairly high food prices or

00:11:10.787 --> 00:11:12.610
illegal business practices.
 

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.629
Normally, they weren't really
excited about tearing things

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:16.000
down.
 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.870
Normally, they involved some
marching and some yelling,

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.625
there was a lot of
effigy-burning,

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:22.220
and then people went home.
 

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.870
So early American mobs again
are almost kind of procedural.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.628
They're sort of what happens
when you're upset and you're a

00:11:28.628 --> 00:11:30.900
member of the public,
and it's not only sort of

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.961
average members of the public--
it's not only the masses taking

00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:35.678
part in these kinds of protests.
 

00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:39.066
All levels of society might
take part at one time or

00:11:39.066 --> 00:11:39.730
another.
 

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.029
So in the summer of 1765,
some Bostonians decided they're

00:11:44.029 --> 00:11:47.408
going to take advantage of this
tradition.

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:51.611
A group of Boston radicals who
eventually called themselves the

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:53.846
Sons of Liberty,
so here's yet another--Now

00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:55.961
we're starting to get to the
part of the course where these

00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:57.928
things come out of my mouth and
you're like 'ding,

00:11:57.928 --> 00:11:59.298
ding, ding, ding,
Revolutionary War moments,

00:11:59.298 --> 00:12:00.711
Sons of Liberty,' and
[inaudible]

00:12:00.711 --> 00:12:03.447
we're going to have another one
by the end of the lecture today

00:12:03.447 --> 00:12:05.080
but here's one:
Sons of Liberty,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.190
Boston.
 

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.080
So these radicals decide
they're going to take action.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.889
And the Sons of Liberty
basically are artisans and

00:12:12.889 --> 00:12:16.389
shopkeepers who want to act in
resistance to the Stamp Act.

00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:20.190
Samuel Adams--who's really more
a member of the elite,

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.153
but he nevertheless was kind of
a champion of the artisan

00:12:23.153 --> 00:12:26.070
class--
and he's among their number too.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:29.436
So let's look for a moment at
what the Sons of Liberty decide

00:12:29.436 --> 00:12:30.951
to do and how it works out.
 

00:12:30.951 --> 00:12:31.399
Okay.
 

00:12:31.399 --> 00:12:33.724
So basically,
in Boston at the time there

00:12:33.724 --> 00:12:37.210
were two really large fraternal
organizations of artisans.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.951
There was one in the north end
of Boston, there was one in the

00:12:39.951 --> 00:12:40.940
south end of Boston.
 

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.879
And the Sons of Liberty
think--well, we have these sort

00:12:43.879 --> 00:12:46.330
of organized groups like clubs
of artisans.

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.808
Why don't we enlist the aid of
one of them?

00:12:48.808 --> 00:12:50.039
They're sort of already
organized.

00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:51.658
They already have a leader.
 

00:12:51.658 --> 00:12:54.921
Maybe we could get them to help
us in some sort of organized

00:12:54.921 --> 00:12:56.690
protest against the Stamp Act.
 

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:01.124
So they appeal to the south end
group, who agrees to take part

00:13:01.124 --> 00:13:03.158
in some kind of a protest.
 

00:13:03.158 --> 00:13:05.855
So now we have this radical
group, the Sons of Liberty,

00:13:05.855 --> 00:13:08.650
who have named themselves,
so they're organized enough to

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.399
have names.
 

00:13:09.399 --> 00:13:12.620
We have an organized force of
men.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.303
And we have a focused desire to
protest against an act of

00:13:16.303 --> 00:13:17.158
Parliament.
 

00:13:17.158 --> 00:13:20.889
So this is on its way to being
a different kind of early

00:13:20.889 --> 00:13:24.960
American mob action than these
other ones might have been.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.395
Okay.
 

00:13:25.395 --> 00:13:29.673
So in Boston the poor guy who
was the stamp agent,

00:13:29.673 --> 00:13:33.950
the stamp distributor,
is named Andrew Oliver.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.023
This is the person you do not
want to be at this particular

00:13:37.023 --> 00:13:37.500
moment.
 

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:37.812
Okay.
 

00:13:37.812 --> 00:13:41.442
So Andrew Oliver is the one
who's going to be giving out or

00:13:41.442 --> 00:13:42.820
selling the stamps.
 

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.797
So obviously this group of men,
they want to do a mob action,

00:13:45.797 --> 00:13:48.029
and they decide okay,
Oliver is the target.

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:51.548
So first they go to his
dockside warehouse.

00:13:51.548 --> 00:13:54.145
They assume actually that
that's where the stamped paper

00:13:54.145 --> 00:13:55.986
is going to be,
so they just destroy the

00:13:55.986 --> 00:13:57.970
warehouse -- I mean,
like, destroy it.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:02.256
Then they go to Oliver's house
and throw rocks and basically

00:14:02.256 --> 00:14:04.220
break all of the windows.
 

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:09.129
Then they take an effigy of
Oliver and they stamp on it.

00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:09.668
Okay. That's not my pun.
 

00:14:09.668 --> 00:14:11.379
That's actually their
pun--right?

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:14.589
The Stamp Act--we're stamping
on Oliver--those wacky early

00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:17.009
Americans with their wild sense
of humor.

00:14:17.009 --> 00:14:19.389
Bad puns of early America.
 

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:20.809
That's the first of this course.
 

00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:22.889
So they stamp on Andrew Oliver.
 

00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:26.698
Oliver responds logically
enough by resigning as stamp

00:14:26.698 --> 00:14:30.580
distributor, [laughs]
which I think was a wise move.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:31.440
Okay. 'You think that?
 

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.500
Thank you very much.
 

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.178
I'm going home to my
broken-window house now.'

00:14:35.178 --> 00:14:37.038
[laughs]
'No more stamps for me.'

00:14:37.038 --> 00:14:37.302
Okay.
 

00:14:37.302 --> 00:14:39.720
Not long after that,
maybe within two weeks,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.128
that same group of men turn on
Lieutenant Governor Thomas

00:14:43.128 --> 00:14:45.846
Hutchinson,
who seemed like a friend to the

00:14:45.846 --> 00:14:46.509
Stamp Act.
 

00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:50.009
This time the mob goes to his
house and they destroy it,

00:14:50.009 --> 00:14:52.620
and I don't just mean rocks at
windows.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.080
They go to Hutchinson's house,
they smash the windows,

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.798
they break in the doors,
they smash the furniture,

00:14:59.798 --> 00:15:03.840
they cut the paintings,
they trash the clothing,

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.730
they cut down the trees in his
garden,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.153
and they're in the process of
removing the roof [laughter]

00:15:11.153 --> 00:15:13.250
when daylight stops them.
 

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.442
Okay.
 

00:15:13.442 --> 00:15:15.528
So this is--On the one hand
it's sort of a weird mob.

00:15:15.528 --> 00:15:16.284
They're like,
'excuse me.

00:15:16.284 --> 00:15:17.230
Can you pass me that hammer?
 

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.528
I've got to remove this
shingle.'

00:15:18.528 --> 00:15:20.697
They're really--
[laughs]--They're an industrious

00:15:20.697 --> 00:15:22.996
mob action,
but they're literally

00:15:22.996 --> 00:15:27.047
completely tearing apart
Hutchinson's pretty sort of

00:15:27.047 --> 00:15:29.350
spiffy mansion in protest.
 

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:32.397
Attacks on stamp distributors
in other colonies followed and

00:15:32.397 --> 00:15:34.980
there were lots of resignations
of stamp agents.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:36.870
Right? 'I'm not doing the job.
 

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.988
[laughs]
Thanks.

00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:39.330
I love my house.
 

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.070
I don't want to do this
anymore.'

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:46.432
So the result of all of this
kind of action is that by

00:15:46.432 --> 00:15:49.912
November of 1765,
when the Stamp Act is actually

00:15:49.912 --> 00:15:52.404
going to go into effect--
So first of all,

00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:55.009
the act actually hasn't gone
into effect yet.

00:15:55.009 --> 00:15:58.476
Everything I've talked about is
leading up to it actually going

00:15:58.476 --> 00:15:59.259
into effect.
 

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:02.538
So November of 1765,
it's due to go into effect but

00:16:02.538 --> 00:16:05.028
people aren't quite sure what to
do.

00:16:05.028 --> 00:16:06.166
Do we ignore it?
 

00:16:06.166 --> 00:16:09.149
Are there actually any stamp
agents left?

00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:10.861
[laughs]
Maybe we don't have to ignore

00:16:10.861 --> 00:16:12.899
it because nobody will sell
stamped paper.

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:13.623
I don't know.
 

00:16:13.623 --> 00:16:16.460
And some people did just choose
to ignore the act.

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:21.629
Others went further and decided
to boycott British goods which,

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:23.168
as we're going to see further
into this course,

00:16:23.168 --> 00:16:26.693
was sometimes a really
effective way to protest against

00:16:26.693 --> 00:16:29.910
the mother country--
basically, hit economically and

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.750
that's bound to make an impact.
 

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.706
But in the middle of all this,
Grenville's ministry fell,

00:16:35.706 --> 00:16:40.158
not because of the Stamp Act
but because of insider politics.

00:16:40.158 --> 00:16:44.190
The colonists saw this as
providential.

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:45.379
Grenville's gone.
 

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:48.912
Clearly it's a sign from
providence that we are meant to

00:16:48.912 --> 00:16:51.304
succeed here,
to come out of this looking

00:16:51.304 --> 00:16:54.240
better than things were when we
were in the middle of it.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.428
The new prime minister is the
Earl of Rockingham.

00:16:57.428 --> 00:17:02.678
Now the Earl of Rockingham had
strong connections with London

00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:03.730
merchants.
 

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.990
London merchants clearly are
people who are going to be

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.310
deeply affected by colonial
boycotting, so they want the

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:11.700
Stamp Act repealed.
 

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.138
So we've got this new Prime
Minister, the Earl of

00:17:14.138 --> 00:17:16.166
Rockingham;
he's in with the merchants who

00:17:16.166 --> 00:17:17.578
are being hurt by the boycott.
 

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:20.659
The idea now is--it would be a
fine thing if we could figure

00:17:20.659 --> 00:17:22.588
out a way to repeal the Stamp
Act,

00:17:22.588 --> 00:17:25.790
but the problem of course is
figuring out how to repeal it

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.848
without seeming weak,
while holding your ground.

00:17:28.848 --> 00:17:33.960
And Rockingham eventually did
repeal the Stamp Act in March of

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.483
1766, but to save face he
assigned blame to the wounded

00:17:38.483 --> 00:17:40.160
British economy.
 

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.740
He did not say anything about
colonial rights.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.944
He said, 'Well,
the economy is suffering and so

00:17:44.944 --> 00:17:46.480
we will repeal the Stamp Act.'
 

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.940
He also passed at the same time
the Declaratory Act--

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:54.799
the Declaratory Act--which
declared in short that

00:17:54.799 --> 00:17:58.578
Parliament could pass laws for
the colonies,

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.660
quote, "in all cases
whatsoever."

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.769
Okay, the Declaratory Act of
1766, really strong statement.

00:18:05.769 --> 00:18:08.155
It's like, 'yeah,
we're going to repeal the Stamp

00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:11.088
Act but we're going to pass this
other act that says no,

00:18:11.088 --> 00:18:14.811
we can basically pass laws for
you however we want to pass

00:18:14.811 --> 00:18:15.269
them.
 

00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:18.624
So we're not caving;
we're just sort of giving in on

00:18:18.624 --> 00:18:19.960
this one little point.'
 

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.853
Now to Britain,
the Declaratory Act asserted

00:18:22.853 --> 00:18:26.890
their control over the colonies,
their legal control over the

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.640
colonies in all cases.
 

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.413
To the colonists,
because it mentioned

00:18:31.413 --> 00:18:35.823
legislation but not taxes,
it seemed to suggest that maybe

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:39.364
they had made their point,
that Parliament is not going to

00:18:39.364 --> 00:18:40.200
assert taxation.
 

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.650
So in a way the Declaratory Act
makes things worse.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.759
It worsens ongoing
misunderstandings between

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:49.605
Parliament and the colonies--
the British not fully

00:18:49.605 --> 00:18:53.082
understanding the colonial
mindset about the workings of

00:18:53.082 --> 00:18:56.054
the empire,
the colonists not viewing their

00:18:56.054 --> 00:18:58.470
own logic as exceptional in any
way.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.690
They assume that their logic
has been understood.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:05.056
The Declaratory Act also didn't
really encourage compromise,

00:19:05.056 --> 00:19:09.275
because if you think about it,
moderates on all sides were

00:19:09.275 --> 00:19:10.460
discredited.
 

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.028
In England, the Declaratory Act
asserted Parliamentary power,

00:19:14.028 --> 00:19:16.288
so it's a strong statement of
power.

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.613
In the colonies,
radicals ruled the day,

00:19:18.613 --> 00:19:21.828
because it seemed as though
they'd made their point.

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:26.816
So as far as the colonies were
concerned, the Stamp Act crisis

00:19:26.816 --> 00:19:30.250
moved many to accept radical
leadership;

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.730
it appears to be working.
 

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:35.003
It also revealed to the
colonies the power of uniting

00:19:35.003 --> 00:19:37.900
the colonies to bring pressure
against England,

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.230
which also seemed to have
worked.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:44.175
Now once again in the middle of
all this, the Prime Minister yet

00:19:44.175 --> 00:19:45.430
again is replaced.
 

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:47.040
Clearly, this is not the time
to be a Prime Minister in

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.338
England.
 

00:19:47.338 --> 00:19:49.348
It's kind of a rocky time going
on.

00:19:49.348 --> 00:19:52.390
So--Rocky time was not meant to
be a pun.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:55.076
The Earl of Rockingham goes
down in this rocky time and

00:19:55.076 --> 00:19:56.420
Charles--I heard a groan.
 

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.275
I didn't do it on purpose.
 

00:19:57.275 --> 00:19:58.130
It just sort of happened.
 

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.671
I'm sorry.
 

00:19:58.671 --> 00:20:01.490
It's a bad pun that I take full
responsibility for.

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.538
But the Earl of Rockingham--His
ministry falls.

00:20:04.538 --> 00:20:08.858
Charles Townshend takes his
place.

00:20:08.858 --> 00:20:12.160
Charles Townshend,
the new Prime Minister--and

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:16.118
he's given the task of balancing
the budget in 1767.

00:20:16.118 --> 00:20:20.023
And like Grenville before him,
Townshend first looks to

00:20:20.023 --> 00:20:23.640
England itself and issues new
taxes in England,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.563
but again he still needs more
income and he does next turn to

00:20:27.563 --> 00:20:30.452
the colonies,
and he devises a scheme that he

00:20:30.452 --> 00:20:33.661
thinks isn't going to be too
upsetting to these sort of

00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:34.848
touchy colonials.
 

00:20:34.848 --> 00:20:37.548
He says he's going to proceed,
quote, "with great

00:20:37.548 --> 00:20:38.769
delicacy,"
right?

00:20:38.769 --> 00:20:41.069
Because it's clear now,
'they get upset over there;

00:20:41.069 --> 00:20:42.368
they get upset.
 

00:20:42.368 --> 00:20:44.260
We need to be careful,
I'm going to proceed with great

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:44.690
delicacy.'
 

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.612
He understands their
sensitivity about this whole

00:20:47.612 --> 00:20:48.828
issue of taxation.
 

00:20:48.828 --> 00:20:54.557
So he decides he's going to ask
for customs duties on items that

00:20:54.557 --> 00:20:58.559
the colonies import from
Britain, like glass,

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:01.470
silk, paper,
paint and--tea.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.599
[laughs]
You can see where we're going.

00:21:03.599 --> 00:21:06.059
But this is not an internal tax.
 

00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:07.460
This is an external tax.
 

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.220
It's not a tax on things within
the colonies.

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.920
It's not a tax on legal
documents.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.049
It's not a tax on playing cards
like the Stamp Act.

00:21:14.049 --> 00:21:15.740
It's an external tax.
 

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:17.778
It's customs duties.
 

00:21:17.778 --> 00:21:20.558
And like before,
Townshend wants the money

00:21:20.558 --> 00:21:24.490
raised by this to go to pay for
royal administration in the

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:26.758
colonies,
so also the money raised isn't

00:21:26.758 --> 00:21:29.865
going back to England;
it's going to be spent on the

00:21:29.865 --> 00:21:30.588
colonies.
 

00:21:30.588 --> 00:21:36.380
Townshend also reorganized the
customs service in the colonies,

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.970
basically tossing out old
customs agents who had been

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:44.388
bought by colonial merchants and
putting hand-picked men in their

00:21:44.388 --> 00:21:45.078
place.
 

00:21:45.078 --> 00:21:47.771
So all in all,
Townshend thought--surely these

00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:51.242
are tame enough measures that
the colonists aren't going to

00:21:51.242 --> 00:21:52.380
object to them.
 

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:52.682
Right?
 

00:21:52.682 --> 00:21:54.810
This seems as though they're
accommodating,

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.990
they're mild,
nothing very dramatic is being

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.750
done here.
 

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:03.640
These come to be known as the
Townshend Acts of 1767.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.314
And sure enough,
the initial response to the

00:22:07.314 --> 00:22:10.390
Townshend Acts is relatively
weak.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:16.200
But, colonial anger is raised
yet again by a publication by a

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.299
colonist named John Dickinson.
 

00:22:19.299 --> 00:22:20.500
He's a Pennsylvanian.
 

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.019
He's in Pennsylvania and he
writes a series of letters.

00:22:24.019 --> 00:22:27.568
First they appear in a
Pennsylvania newspaper.

00:22:27.568 --> 00:22:30.538
They're eventually published in
other colonial newspapers,

00:22:30.538 --> 00:22:33.402
and then finally they're put
together and published in a

00:22:33.402 --> 00:22:34.078
pamphlet.
 

00:22:34.078 --> 00:22:36.894
This is all in 1767--and the
pamphlet is named Letters

00:22:36.894 --> 00:22:40.011
from a Farmer in Pennsylvania to
the Inhabitants of the British

00:22:40.011 --> 00:22:43.079
Colonies. They had very
literal titles in these days;

00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:44.529
this is one of them.
 

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:45.971
John Dickinson,
Pennsylvanian,

00:22:45.971 --> 00:22:48.857
Letters from a Farmer in
Pennsylvania to the Inhabitants

00:22:48.857 --> 00:22:50.450
of the British Colonies.
 

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:54.098
Now Dickinson actually--When
you read these,

00:22:54.098 --> 00:22:56.730
he's pretty moderate in tone.
 

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:00.817
And most of what he does is he
uses past precedent to argue

00:23:00.817 --> 00:23:05.259
against the right of Parliament
to directly tax the colonies.

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:07.854
He asserts directly:
we're not talking about

00:23:07.854 --> 00:23:10.904
independence;
we're just talking about past

00:23:10.904 --> 00:23:11.720
precedent.
 

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.821
However, he also says,
and this is a quote from him,

00:23:14.821 --> 00:23:17.618
"We cannot be happy
without being free.

00:23:17.618 --> 00:23:21.640
We cannot be free without being
secure in our property.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.170
We cannot be secure in our
property,

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:26.798
if without our consent,
others may,

00:23:26.798 --> 00:23:28.699
as by right,
take it away,

00:23:28.699 --> 00:23:31.890
that taxes imposed on us by
Parliament,

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.730
do thus take it away."
 

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.089
That's really clear,
direct logic.

00:23:35.089 --> 00:23:35.420
Right?
 

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:37.490
We can't be happy without being
free.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.630
We can't be free without being
secure in our property.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.230
We can't be secure in our
property if without our consent,

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:44.511
others may take it away,
and Parliament seems to be

00:23:44.511 --> 00:23:45.380
taking it away.
 

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.569
So Dickinson isn't arguing
anything amazingly new here,

00:23:48.569 --> 00:23:51.818
but he's certainly stating it
with real clarity and real

00:23:51.818 --> 00:23:52.410
power.
 

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.358
And he also appears to be
saying, 'Well,

00:23:54.358 --> 00:23:57.558
some of that stuff we learned
from that whole Stamp Act thing?

00:23:57.558 --> 00:24:01.240
I think they apply as well to
this new Townshend Act thing.'

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.440
He appears to be drawing a
pattern.

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.815
So Letters from a Farmer in
Pennsylvania ultimately has

00:24:06.815 --> 00:24:07.480
an impact.
 

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.980
It's a strong statement.
 

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.199
Up in Boston,
there was also some writing

00:24:13.199 --> 00:24:14.358
going on.
 

00:24:14.358 --> 00:24:18.348
And there, Samuel Adams,
who was in the Massachusetts

00:24:18.348 --> 00:24:22.491
assembly, wrote a circular
letter that he sent to other

00:24:22.491 --> 00:24:23.490
colonies.
 

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.890
Yet again, another circular
letter,

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.277
and this time it's a circular
letter protesting against the

00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:32.000
Townshend Acts and it's
moderate,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.538
but it's criticizing the acts.
 

00:24:34.538 --> 00:24:37.808
It does deny--It's--We're --
'This isn't about independence,

00:24:37.808 --> 00:24:41.759
we're not trying to rebel
here'--but it does urge joint

00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:44.980
colonial resistance to the
Townshend Acts.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:48.532
Now back in England,
many people urged a lenient

00:24:48.532 --> 00:24:49.970
response to this.
 

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.089
If you think about it,
potentially,

00:24:52.089 --> 00:24:53.400
it's a scary thing.
 

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.388
You have this guy--this radical
guy in Boston--who's urging

00:24:56.388 --> 00:24:59.068
joint colonial resistance to an
act of Parliament.

00:24:59.068 --> 00:25:01.154
So as you will see,
some people get rather upset by

00:25:01.154 --> 00:25:02.240
this, but not everybody.
 

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.690
Some people say, 'Well, okay.
 

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:08.078
Let's not over-respond;
let's not overreact.'

00:25:08.078 --> 00:25:12.202
However, the British Secretary
of State, Lord Hillsborough,

00:25:12.202 --> 00:25:16.396
really saw this as organized
resistance and refused to stand

00:25:16.396 --> 00:25:17.180
for it.
 

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:22.358
So in 1768, privately
consulting with the King,

00:25:22.358 --> 00:25:25.288
so kind of doing this off on
the side,

00:25:25.288 --> 00:25:28.890
he instructed the Governor of
Massachusetts to dissolve the

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:32.490
Massachusetts assembly unless
they took back the letter.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:36.304
He also sent a letter to all
royal governors telling them to

00:25:36.304 --> 00:25:40.311
ignore the Massachusetts letter
or else he would dissolve their

00:25:40.311 --> 00:25:41.670
legislatures too.
 

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:41.952
Okay.
 

00:25:41.952 --> 00:25:45.122
That's--There's a strong
statement for you that's clearly

00:25:45.122 --> 00:25:47.838
bound to make colonists get
very, very upset.

00:25:47.838 --> 00:25:51.263
Hillsborough also,
knowing that people are going

00:25:51.263 --> 00:25:53.713
to get upset,
urged General Thomas

00:25:53.713 --> 00:25:57.632
Gage--who's commander-in-chief
of the army and at the time was

00:25:57.632 --> 00:26:01.336
posted in New York--
he urges Gage in New York to

00:26:01.336 --> 00:26:05.548
prepare his troops in case
they're needed in Boston.

00:26:05.548 --> 00:26:05.829
Okay.
 

00:26:05.829 --> 00:26:08.519
So he's anticipating there
might be a response;

00:26:08.519 --> 00:26:11.645
it would be nice to have troops
potentially ready to go to

00:26:11.645 --> 00:26:12.140
Boston.
 

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:15.460
So now, troops are being
organized,

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:18.630
there's threats about
dissolving assemblies,

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:21.915
and communication between the
colonies in the form of a

00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:24.288
circular letter is being
discouraged.

00:26:24.288 --> 00:26:26.981
So clearly, if you're a
colonist at this point,

00:26:26.981 --> 00:26:29.910
there appears to be a plan of
repression, right?

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:30.343
A plan.
 

00:26:30.343 --> 00:26:32.759
There seems to be a system of
tyranny.

00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:36.753
There seems to be some kind of
organized attack on colonial

00:26:36.753 --> 00:26:38.897
liberties,
and I'm emphasizing plan and

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:41.482
system and organized because
next week that's the direction

00:26:41.482 --> 00:26:43.490
we're going to be going with the
lectures.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:45.817
We're going to be looking at
what I call the logic of

00:26:45.817 --> 00:26:48.593
resistance, or--how does all of
this add up in the minds of the

00:26:48.593 --> 00:26:49.220
colonists?
 

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.273
What's--what are they
drawing--what conclusions are

00:26:51.273 --> 00:26:53.368
they drawing based on actions
that are happening?

00:26:53.368 --> 00:26:56.249
And as we'll see in the
lectures and in the readings for

00:26:56.249 --> 00:26:58.616
next week,
there's a lot of conclusions

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:01.509
being drawn about an actual
system of tyranny,

00:27:01.509 --> 00:27:03.906
which is a very
eighteenth-century way of kind

00:27:03.906 --> 00:27:04.920
of looking at it.
 

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.355
So colonists are wondering if
there's a sort of system of

00:27:08.355 --> 00:27:10.318
repression being put in place.
 

00:27:10.318 --> 00:27:14.058
Meanwhile, Parliament,
eventually, in 1770,

00:27:14.058 --> 00:27:19.522
repeals most of the Townshend
Acts but does preserve the tax

00:27:19.522 --> 00:27:22.214
on tea,
partly for revenue and partly

00:27:22.214 --> 00:27:25.930
to prove that they still have
the right to tax the colonies.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:28.938
So we're half-seeing revenue
raising and half-seeing an

00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:29.828
argument here.
 

00:27:29.828 --> 00:27:32.666
And probably there was an
assumption on the part of

00:27:32.666 --> 00:27:35.902
Parliament that by repealing
most of the acts things would

00:27:35.902 --> 00:27:38.959
quiet down,
but as events in Boston were

00:27:38.959 --> 00:27:42.259
about to prove this would not be
the case.

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:46.904
As we're about to see,
between 1768 and 1774,

00:27:46.904 --> 00:27:51.548
Boston really ends up taking
center stage.

00:27:51.548 --> 00:27:55.230
And thanks in part to the
actions of Samuel Adams who

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.127
really is--
you'll see today--a brilliant

00:27:58.127 --> 00:28:01.878
propagandist and a man with a
really fierce sense of his

00:28:01.878 --> 00:28:03.977
rights--
his British rights and his

00:28:03.977 --> 00:28:05.740
grievances as an English
subject.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.259
And I will add that Samuel
Adams did brew beer.

00:28:08.259 --> 00:28:08.593
Right?
 

00:28:08.593 --> 00:28:11.488
He actually is--Samuel Adams is
associated with beer,

00:28:11.488 --> 00:28:14.548
so truth in advertising,
though I have no idea if that's

00:28:14.548 --> 00:28:16.720
an accurate portrait of Sam
Adams.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.977
Student: It's Paul
Revere.

00:28:17.977 --> 00:28:18.920
Sam Adams is too ugly.
 

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.390
Prof: Sam Adams is too
ugly.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.670
[laughs] Oh, poor Sam Adams.
 

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.278
I feel very bad now.
 

00:28:24.278 --> 00:28:24.932
[laughs]
Oh.

00:28:24.932 --> 00:28:28.380
Well, he's not attractive but I
don't know if he's ugly.

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.420
I feel bad.
 

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.407
Now I'm going to have to find a
way to redeem Sam Adams in the--

00:28:32.407 --> 00:28:32.930
[laughs].
 

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.848
Thank you very much.
 

00:28:34.848 --> 00:28:37.535
No wonder I didn't think it was
entirely an accurate

00:28:37.535 --> 00:28:38.430
portrait--Okay.
 

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.420
And yet he is associated with
beer.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:40.741
Okay.
 

00:28:40.741 --> 00:28:43.519
So Sam Adams--He's going to
have a moment.

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:47.615
October of 1768,
troops actually arrive in

00:28:47.615 --> 00:28:53.211
Boston at the instigation of
Massachusetts Royal Governor

00:28:53.211 --> 00:28:57.265
Francis Bernard,
who's alarmed at the sort of

00:28:57.265 --> 00:28:59.848
radical rumblings that he's
hearing.

00:28:59.848 --> 00:29:06.460
Parliament makes things worse
by--in December of 1768--

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.633
by proposing that the
ringleaders behind that circular

00:29:08.633 --> 00:29:10.558
letter that seems like organized
resistance,

00:29:10.558 --> 00:29:13.578
that they should be brought to
trial for treason,

00:29:13.578 --> 00:29:16.960
and using an obscure law,
they say that they should be

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.640
brought to trial for treason in
England;

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.078
they should go trial in
England.

00:29:22.078 --> 00:29:22.630
Okay.
 

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.141
Again not something that's
going to make colonists really

00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:25.500
happy.
 

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.270
Not surprisingly,
when you have the next election

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.491
for the assembly in
Massachusetts in 1769,

00:29:32.491 --> 00:29:35.950
a large number of radicals get
voted in.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.710
And this new assembly passes,
logically enough,

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.220
radical resolutions again
largely the work of Samuel

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.703
Adams,
the sadly not good-looking

00:29:45.703 --> 00:29:47.681
Samuel Adams,
[laughter]

00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:52.185
who declared in these
resolutions that "no man

00:29:52.185 --> 00:29:57.016
can be justly taxed by,
or bound in conscience to obey,

00:29:57.016 --> 00:30:01.423
any law to which he has not
given his consent in person or

00:30:01.423 --> 00:30:03.818
by his representative."
 

00:30:03.818 --> 00:30:04.084
Okay.
 

00:30:04.084 --> 00:30:07.259
That's a stronger statement
than the ones we've had before.

00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:09.034
What he's saying
here--Formally,

00:30:09.034 --> 00:30:12.509
like other colonial assemblies,
the Massachusetts assembly was

00:30:12.509 --> 00:30:14.490
saying,
'well, Parliament can legislate

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.531
for us but they can't directly
tax us without our consent,' but

00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:21.260
this statement says,
'Parliament can't legislate for

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.390
us if we have no say in the
process.'

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:24.711
Bang.
 

00:30:24.711 --> 00:30:26.769
That's a very strong statement.
 

00:30:26.769 --> 00:30:31.027
So clearly there's a lot of
emotion that has been raised

00:30:31.027 --> 00:30:34.818
about what the British
administration is doing.

00:30:34.818 --> 00:30:37.740
It's being vented in radical
resolves like that.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:42.863
The arrival of troops in Boston
in 1768 ended up really focusing

00:30:42.863 --> 00:30:46.604
these feelings of grievance,
these--this anger,

00:30:46.604 --> 00:30:48.798
these sort of passions.
 

00:30:48.798 --> 00:30:52.544
You have troops being sent to
Boston at a moment where people

00:30:52.544 --> 00:30:56.602
are angry at the British;
surely enough you can see that

00:30:56.602 --> 00:31:01.109
the colonists are going to vent
their feelings towards the

00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:02.058
soldiers.
 

00:31:02.058 --> 00:31:04.700
Troops being sent to Boston
increase colonial assumptions

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:07.338
that they are being treated as
second-class citizens,

00:31:07.338 --> 00:31:10.423
as lower-class subjects,
as people who are not equal to

00:31:10.423 --> 00:31:12.880
other British subjects within
the empire.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.380
And Samuel Adams said this
really clearly in a newspaper

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.288
article written at the time.
 

00:31:18.288 --> 00:31:22.037
He wrote: "It is well
known from the first landing of

00:31:22.037 --> 00:31:25.785
the troops that the troops'
behavior was to a great degree

00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:29.795
insolent and such as looked as
if they really believed that we

00:31:29.795 --> 00:31:33.412
were a country of rebels and
that they were sent here to

00:31:33.412 --> 00:31:34.990
subdue us."
 

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.327
Right?
 

00:31:35.327 --> 00:31:38.528
Again Adams is propagandizing
so he's always saying things

00:31:38.528 --> 00:31:41.387
with a sort of extra twist,
but what he's saying is,

00:31:41.387 --> 00:31:43.952
it was very clear that when the
troops arrived they were

00:31:43.952 --> 00:31:46.750
treating us like lowly rebels
and that they were sent here to

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:47.450
subdue us.
 

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.759
Okay.
 

00:31:47.759 --> 00:31:50.479
So given all of these
feelings--fears about a

00:31:50.479 --> 00:31:54.003
tyrannical standing army that's
inside a sort of system of

00:31:54.003 --> 00:31:56.851
tyranny--
it makes sense that when these

00:31:56.851 --> 00:32:00.285
troops arrive in Boston
relations are not going to be

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:04.048
good between people in Boston
and soldiers in Boston,

00:32:04.048 --> 00:32:06.811
which brings us to yet another
sort of bell-ringing

00:32:06.811 --> 00:32:09.939
Revolutionary War moment,
a particularly noteworthy

00:32:09.939 --> 00:32:13.413
active resistance in Boston
later memorialized by clever

00:32:13.413 --> 00:32:16.509
colonial propagandists as the
Boston Massacre.

00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:16.796
Right?
 

00:32:16.796 --> 00:32:18.180
That's how we know it today.
 

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.650
They gave it--Colonists gave it
that name.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.380
It's a snappy name. Right?
 

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.010
We kept the name.
 

00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.680
We like the name.
 

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.240
It really has some zing,
makes a political point.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:30.490
So let's look for a minute here
at the details of the Boston

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.663
Massacre,
partly because they're really

00:32:32.663 --> 00:32:36.165
interesting as you'll see--
it's just a really interesting

00:32:36.165 --> 00:32:38.259
incident--
but also because I think if you

00:32:38.259 --> 00:32:40.660
look at how the colonists and
the soldiers were interacting,

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.875
it really will reveal something
about the dynamic of

00:32:43.875 --> 00:32:46.460
colonial-British relations at
the time.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:49.316
Now first off,
it's important to understand

00:32:49.316 --> 00:32:53.464
that the Boston Massacre wasn't
this little isolated moment of

00:32:53.464 --> 00:32:56.390
conflict between soldiers and
citizens.

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:01.307
Between 1768 and early 1770,
tensions were building between

00:33:01.307 --> 00:33:05.768
the colonists and the troops,
and in early 1770 there

00:33:05.768 --> 00:33:09.690
actually were a number--
several--different outbursts of

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:13.210
hostility between townspeople
and soldiers in Boston.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.817
So an example: On March 2^(nd),
Samuel Grey,

00:33:16.817 --> 00:33:20.135
a rope maker,
asked a passing soldier if he

00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:22.672
wanted a job,
and when the soldier,

00:33:22.672 --> 00:33:24.893
who was probably underpaid,
said, 'Yeah,

00:33:24.893 --> 00:33:27.759
actually I could use a second
job,' Grey laughed and said,

00:33:27.759 --> 00:33:29.759
'Good. Go clean my outhouse.'
 

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:31.828
This did not make the soldier
happy,

00:33:31.828 --> 00:33:35.890
so the soldier slugged Grey,
and Grey hit back,

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:38.134
and other people--soldiers ran
out and other colonists ran over

00:33:38.134 --> 00:33:40.319
and there was a fight--
there was a street fight.

00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:45.246
A few days later, March 5^(th),
another fight broke out when

00:33:45.246 --> 00:33:49.084
another civilian said something
insulting to another soldier and

00:33:49.084 --> 00:33:52.617
they began punching each other
and there was another street

00:33:52.617 --> 00:33:55.279
fight--
and that would be the first in

00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:58.880
a series of increasingly
agitated clashes on that day,

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.821
March 5^(th),
1770, that's going to end in

00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:02.538
gunfire.
 

00:34:02.538 --> 00:34:06.618
But obviously the Boston
Massacre is not the first moment

00:34:06.618 --> 00:34:07.640
of conflict.
 

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:10.869
Now later that evening--There's
a series of little outbursts

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:12.239
that day, March 5^(th).
 

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:16.157
Later that evening a small boy
walking out on the street began

00:34:16.157 --> 00:34:19.175
taunting a soldier,
and the soldier responded by

00:34:19.175 --> 00:34:20.590
knocking him down.
 

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.789
Well, the boy got up,
went off, found some other

00:34:23.789 --> 00:34:27.668
colonists in the street and
complained that a soldier over

00:34:27.668 --> 00:34:29.780
there had knocked him down.
 

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:29.969
Okay.
 

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.128
So in this environment that's
going to really get a lot of

00:34:32.128 --> 00:34:32.849
colonists upset.
 

00:34:32.849 --> 00:34:35.070
So a little ring of people
surrounds the kid.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:36.860
'He's knocking down a kid?
 

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.730
We need to go get the soldiers.'
 

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:39.092
Right?
 

00:34:39.092 --> 00:34:42.534
So a small group of colonists
heads off to the barracks to

00:34:42.534 --> 00:34:46.400
actually accost the soldiers,
but they're held off by guards.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.237
Soon thereafter,
someone begins ringing the bell

00:34:50.237 --> 00:34:53.902
of the Boston Meeting House--
and normally when you ring the

00:34:53.902 --> 00:34:56.170
bell of the Boston Meeting House
that's a signal for fire,

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.813
and fire is a serious thing in
a place full of wooden

00:34:58.813 --> 00:34:59.322
buildings.
 

00:34:59.322 --> 00:34:59.780
Right?
 

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.099
So if the bell is ringing that
means, 'oh, my God,

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:04.844
there's a fire'--and everyone
does what they should do when

00:35:04.844 --> 00:35:06.028
there's an alarm of fire.
 

00:35:06.028 --> 00:35:06.550
Right?
 

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:09.547
The bell goes off and dozens
and dozens and dozens of people

00:35:09.547 --> 00:35:12.190
run in to the street thinking
that there's a fire.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.190
Now from this point we have
several accounts.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:17.657
There are a number of accounts
about what happened,

00:35:17.657 --> 00:35:20.175
some of them conflict,
and we're going to be looking

00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:21.460
at two accounts today.
 

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:24.030
We're going to be looking at
one by British general Thomas

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.465
Gage, I mentioned before,
the commander-in-chief of the

00:35:26.465 --> 00:35:27.730
British army in America.
 

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.021
He's posted in New York but he
had gotten a very detailed

00:35:31.021 --> 00:35:34.429
report about what happened in
Boston from his soldiers--

00:35:34.429 --> 00:35:37.753
his officers and men--on
exactly what they think they

00:35:37.753 --> 00:35:38.650
experienced.
 

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:41.019
And then the other account is
by Samuel Adams,

00:35:41.019 --> 00:35:44.181
radical propagandist--clearly
is going to be a very different

00:35:44.181 --> 00:35:45.130
point of view.
 

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:45.525
Okay.
 

00:35:45.525 --> 00:35:50.353
So Gage sends a very detailed
report to a member of the King's

00:35:50.353 --> 00:35:55.181
cabinet in London based on what
the British soldiers in Boston

00:35:55.181 --> 00:35:56.289
told him.
 

00:35:56.289 --> 00:36:00.271
Assuming that the colonists in
general were insolent and were

00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:03.059
pushing to get more than they
deserved,

00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:06.635
Gage says in his statement,
he suspects that the entire

00:36:06.635 --> 00:36:08.159
thing was deliberate.
 

00:36:08.159 --> 00:36:10.726
He thinks that there were some
colonists who probably

00:36:10.726 --> 00:36:13.440
prearranged what happened,
armed themselves with sticks,

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.018
rocks, bricks and snowballs.
 

00:36:15.018 --> 00:36:17.224
I'm sorry, but snowballs just
never sounds like a scary weapon

00:36:17.224 --> 00:36:18.717
to me,
even though bad things happen

00:36:18.717 --> 00:36:20.221
here,
and I know I would not like to

00:36:20.221 --> 00:36:22.949
be hit with a snowball,
but it's not like a brick.

00:36:22.949 --> 00:36:24.909
But snowballs are--Everyone's
complaining about snowballs in

00:36:24.909 --> 00:36:25.840
these accounts you'll see.
 

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.960
Somehow it just makes it seem
less serious.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.300
I don't know why.
 

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.150
But anyway, he thinks it's
deliberate;

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.820
he thinks the colonists
prearranged it;

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.711
that they armed themselves with
sticks, rocks,

00:36:34.711 --> 00:36:37.563
bricks and snowballs;
planned the ringing of the bell

00:36:37.563 --> 00:36:41.210
so that Bostonians would rise up
at the signal and attack the

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.940
soldiers.
 

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:42.173
Okay.
 

00:36:42.173 --> 00:36:44.373
So this is what Gage
assumes--and here is Gage's

00:36:44.373 --> 00:36:44.889
account.
 

00:36:44.889 --> 00:36:48.557
"Many people came out of
their houses supposing a fire in

00:36:48.557 --> 00:36:50.885
the town,
and several officers on the

00:36:50.885 --> 00:36:53.739
same supposition were repairing
to their posts;

00:36:53.739 --> 00:36:56.362
but meeting with mobs were
reviled, attacked,

00:36:56.362 --> 00:36:59.880
and those who could not escape
knocked down and treated with

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.489
great inhumanity."
 

00:37:01.489 --> 00:37:01.797
Right?
 

00:37:01.797 --> 00:37:03.896
'Those crude,
nasty colonists are treating

00:37:03.896 --> 00:37:05.329
the soldiers very badly.'
 

00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:07.887
"Different mobs paraded
through the streets,

00:37:07.887 --> 00:37:10.927
passing the several barracks
and provoking the soldiers to

00:37:10.927 --> 00:37:11.619
come out.
 

00:37:11.619 --> 00:37:15.001
One body went to the main guard
where every provocation was

00:37:15.001 --> 00:37:18.150
given, without effect,
for the guard remained quiet.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.670
From thence the mob proceeded
to a sentinel"--

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.726
a single sentinel --
"posted upon the

00:37:22.726 --> 00:37:25.065
customhouse,
at a small distance from the

00:37:25.065 --> 00:37:27.469
guard,
and attacked him.

00:37:27.469 --> 00:37:29.612
He defended himself as well as
he could, calling out for

00:37:29.612 --> 00:37:30.119
help."
 

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:30.360
Okay.
 

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.331
There's one guy according to
this account,

00:37:32.331 --> 00:37:35.360
and the mob attacks the one guy
standing in front of the customs

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:35.889
house.
 

00:37:35.889 --> 00:37:38.751
"And people ran to the
guard to give information of his

00:37:38.751 --> 00:37:39.480
danger."
 

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.344
So according to Gage,
people see this one guy getting

00:37:41.344 --> 00:37:42.849
attacked by a bunch of people
and they--

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:45.931
actually colonists--run to get
other soldiers to help the one

00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:46.239
guy.
 

00:37:46.239 --> 00:37:48.972
So according to Gage's account,
they're not all crazy radicals

00:37:48.972 --> 00:37:49.510
in Boston.
 

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.768
Some of them are out there
helping us.

00:37:51.768 --> 00:37:54.710
"Captain Preston,
hearing the sentinel was in

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:57.230
danger of being
murdered"--already;

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.688
we got to murder really
fast--"he detached a

00:37:59.688 --> 00:38:02.608
sergeant and 12 men to relieve
him and soon after followed

00:38:02.608 --> 00:38:05.682
himself to prevent to prevent
any rash act on the part of the

00:38:05.682 --> 00:38:06.349
troops.
 

00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:09.402
This party as well as the
sentinel was immediately

00:38:09.402 --> 00:38:12.210
attacked,
some colonists throwing bricks,

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:13.735
stones,
pieces of ice,

00:38:13.735 --> 00:38:15.864
and snowballs"--
once again the

00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:18.657
snowballs--"at them whilst
others advanced up to their

00:38:18.657 --> 00:38:21.739
bayonets and endeavored to close
with them to use their bludgeons

00:38:21.739 --> 00:38:24.085
and clubs,
calling out to them to fire if

00:38:24.085 --> 00:38:26.713
they dared and provoking them in
a most opprobrious

00:38:26.713 --> 00:38:27.659
language."
 

00:38:27.659 --> 00:38:28.115
Right?
 

00:38:28.115 --> 00:38:31.309
Again -- 'rude colonists
behaving badly.'

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:34.827
So we have a group of soldiers
that are lined up in front of

00:38:34.827 --> 00:38:37.929
the customs house running to
protect a fellow soldier

00:38:37.929 --> 00:38:41.626
supposedly being murdered at the
hands of a crude and angry mob

00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:44.489
armed with sticks and rocks and
snowballs.

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:47.768
Okay. Let's segue over to Adams.
 

00:38:47.768 --> 00:38:50.791
Adams writes a series of
newspaper essays for the

00:38:50.791 --> 00:38:54.190
Boston Gazette describing
the same incident,

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:57.163
often quoting testimony from
the trial of the soldiers that

00:38:57.163 --> 00:38:59.469
obviously takes place after this
incident,

00:38:59.469 --> 00:39:03.746
but also obviously quoting them
and telling the story with his

00:39:03.746 --> 00:39:05.150
own radical flair.
 

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.710
Now remember here the different
reasons for these accounts.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.409
And this is actually a great
example of the importance of

00:39:11.409 --> 00:39:13.869
thinking about the nature of
historical evidence.

00:39:13.869 --> 00:39:16.815
Who things are written to and
why they're written has a

00:39:16.815 --> 00:39:19.380
lot to do with how you
interpret them.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:19.661
Right?
 

00:39:19.661 --> 00:39:22.103
You have these two documents
being written for really

00:39:22.103 --> 00:39:24.360
specific reasons to a very
specific audience.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.362
So Gage is trying to explain to
royal authorities a shooting

00:39:28.362 --> 00:39:30.670
that never should have happened.
 

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:34.710
He has to somehow justify this,
so he's appealing to the people

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.465
he sent the letter to--
whoever this royal authority

00:39:37.465 --> 00:39:39.755
was--and he has to assume that
other royal authorities are

00:39:39.755 --> 00:39:40.518
going to see it.
 

00:39:40.518 --> 00:39:43.632
He's appealing to them as
fellow sophisticated Englishmen

00:39:43.632 --> 00:39:46.634
who understand the nature of
things out in this sort of

00:39:46.634 --> 00:39:49.548
frontier colony area,
crude colonists,

00:39:49.548 --> 00:39:51.110
upset colonists.
 

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:55.230
So in a sense Gage is offering
sort of an extreme version of

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:59.349
some typical English sentiment
among--about the colonies.

00:39:59.349 --> 00:40:02.414
Adams is writing to the
colonial public and he's trying

00:40:02.414 --> 00:40:05.875
to raise a public outcry against
the soldiers and obviously by

00:40:05.875 --> 00:40:07.974
association,
against the British

00:40:07.974 --> 00:40:10.585
administration,
and clearly Adams is going to

00:40:10.585 --> 00:40:13.829
want to depict these soldiers as
cruel and tyrannical as all

00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:16.338
standing armies are,
so in a sense Adams is

00:40:16.338 --> 00:40:19.367
certainly going to be offering
an extreme version of some

00:40:19.367 --> 00:40:22.503
colonial sentiment at the time
about the soldiers and maybe

00:40:22.503 --> 00:40:25.099
about the British administration
generally.

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:25.364
Okay.
 

00:40:25.364 --> 00:40:28.597
So here is Adams' version from
the moment when the bell starts

00:40:28.597 --> 00:40:29.179
to ring.
 

00:40:29.179 --> 00:40:31.882
"The ringing of the bells
alarmed the town,

00:40:31.882 --> 00:40:35.449
it being supposed by the people
in general there was a fire.

00:40:35.449 --> 00:40:38.597
As the people came in to the
street, the boy who had been

00:40:38.597 --> 00:40:41.576
knocked down told them that the
sentry had knocked him

00:40:41.576 --> 00:40:42.420
down."
 

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.581
Okay, and I'm actually quoting
so this--you can't blame me for

00:40:44.581 --> 00:40:44.829
this.
 

00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:46.851
The boy says,
'A sentry knocked me down,'

00:40:46.851 --> 00:40:49.719
points at the solider and says,
"There's the son of a

00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:51.309
b[it]ch that knocked me
down."

00:40:51.309 --> 00:40:53.449
[laughter]
I love that that detail is in

00:40:53.449 --> 00:40:56.411
the newspaper [laughs]--and
that's another one of those

00:40:56.411 --> 00:40:58.880
things that like--they said that
in 1770?

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.960
[laughter] And they did.
 

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.500
Other people heard this and
cried, "Kill him."

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.768
[laughter] Hey.
 

00:41:08.768 --> 00:41:10.253
[laughs]
"The sentry ran to the

00:41:10.253 --> 00:41:11.905
custom-house steps,
knocked at the door,

00:41:11.905 --> 00:41:13.219
but could not get in."
 

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:14.034
'Excuse me.
 

00:41:14.034 --> 00:41:16.699
[laughs]
They're going to kill me.'

00:41:16.699 --> 00:41:19.253
He primed and loaded his gun
and leveled it and told the

00:41:19.253 --> 00:41:21.670
people to stand off,
and called to the main guard.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:24.065
"Various were the
dispositions and inclinations of

00:41:24.065 --> 00:41:25.530
the people"
at this point.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.318
"The cooler sort advised
to go home: The curious were

00:41:28.318 --> 00:41:30.130
willing to stay and see the
event,

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:31.849
and those whose feelings were
warmer,

00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:34.389
perhaps partook of the boy's
resentment."

00:41:34.389 --> 00:41:36.688
And here he's trying to justify
like--okay there were some

00:41:36.688 --> 00:41:38.947
crazy, radical guys but they
were probably upset with the

00:41:38.947 --> 00:41:39.269
boy.
 

00:41:39.269 --> 00:41:40.340
Right? They weren't angry.
 

00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.710
They were just--Of course
they'd be upset.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:44.039
The boy was attacked.
 

00:41:44.039 --> 00:41:48.315
The soldiers moved to help the
sentry standing alone before the

00:41:48.315 --> 00:41:48.730
mob.
 

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.929
Adams said the soldiers moved,
quote,

00:41:50.929 --> 00:41:53.623
with "an haughty air--
they push'd their bayonets and

00:41:53.623 --> 00:41:55.619
damn'd the people as they went
along--

00:41:55.619 --> 00:41:56.920
and when they arriv'd at their
post,

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.833
one witness who is a young
gentleman of a liberal education

00:41:59.833 --> 00:42:02.056
and an unspotted character,
[laughter]

00:42:02.056 --> 00:42:05.931
declared, that one of the
soldiers whom he particularly

00:42:05.931 --> 00:42:07.536
named,
loaded his gun,

00:42:07.536 --> 00:42:10.489
pushed him with his bayonet and
damn'd him."

00:42:10.489 --> 00:42:11.949
Ooh. Okay.
 

00:42:11.949 --> 00:42:13.409
[laughter]
So here, according to Adams,

00:42:13.409 --> 00:42:15.909
there's this rude,
imperious British soldier

00:42:15.909 --> 00:42:19.047
treating the young gentleman of
a liberal education and

00:42:19.047 --> 00:42:22.130
unspotted character [laughs]
like a lesser being.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.375
Okay.
 

00:42:22.375 --> 00:42:25.119
So now both narrators have
gotten us to the same point.

00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:26.639
We have soldiers lined up.
 

00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:28.518
They have just very visibly
loaded their guns.

00:42:28.518 --> 00:42:31.639
In front of them stands British
Captain Preston with--who is in

00:42:31.639 --> 00:42:34.860
command of the men--and in front
of Preston is an angry crowd.

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.900
So according to Gage,
at this point Preston--

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.268
soldiers behind him--crowd in
front of him--

00:42:40.268 --> 00:42:42.780
he's trying to calm the
situation down,

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.175
and supposedly he's asked,
'Are you going to ask those

00:42:45.175 --> 00:42:46.349
soldiers to fire on us?'
 

00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:49.190
and Preston says, 'Yeah.
 

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:53.099
See, the guns are behind me and
you're in front of me.

00:42:53.099 --> 00:42:54.650
No. Really.
 

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:56.447
[laughter]
It wouldn't be a good idea for

00:42:56.447 --> 00:42:58.110
them to fire now because I'll
die.'

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:58.402
Right?
 

00:42:58.402 --> 00:42:59.719
[laughter]
He's like 'No.'

00:42:59.719 --> 00:43:01.530
It's a good point I think.
 

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.436
But "all he could say had
no effect, and one of the

00:43:04.436 --> 00:43:07.289
soldiers, receiving a violent
blow, instantly fired.

00:43:07.289 --> 00:43:09.400
Captain Preston turned around
to see who fired,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.925
and received a blow upon his
arm, which was aimed at his

00:43:11.925 --> 00:43:12.900
head;
and the mob,

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.652
at first seeing no execution
done and imagining the soldiers

00:43:15.652 --> 00:43:17.659
had only fired powder to
frighten them,

00:43:17.659 --> 00:43:19.929
grew more bold and attacked
with greater violence,

00:43:19.929 --> 00:43:24.110
continually striking at the
soldiers and pelting them,

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.840
and calling out to them to
fire."

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.643
And we have Captain Preston's
description of what he heard

00:43:28.643 --> 00:43:29.480
from the crowd.
 

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.472
He says the crowd was yelling,
"Come on,

00:43:31.472 --> 00:43:32.606
you rascals,
bloody backs,

00:43:32.606 --> 00:43:33.920
lobster scoundrels."
 

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.641
[laughs]
Quite a little string of

00:43:35.641 --> 00:43:36.179
insults.
 

00:43:36.179 --> 00:43:37.929
"Fire if you dare.
 

00:43:37.929 --> 00:43:39.340
You dare not fire."
 

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:39.603
Okay.
 

00:43:39.603 --> 00:43:41.925
So Gage goes on,
"The soldiers at length

00:43:41.925 --> 00:43:43.880
perceiving their lives in
danger,

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.530
and hearing the word 'fire' all
round them,

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:48.199
three or four of them fired one
after another,

00:43:48.199 --> 00:43:50.550
and again three more in the
hurry and confusion.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:53.338
Four or five persons were
unfortunately killed"--un

00:43:53.338 --> 00:43:55.570
fortunately--"and more
wounded."

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:55.811
Okay.
 

00:43:55.811 --> 00:43:58.090
So that's basically the end of
Gage's account.

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.996
Clearly, in his account the
soldiers are under serious

00:44:00.996 --> 00:44:01.489
attack.
 

00:44:01.489 --> 00:44:03.179
Adams tells a different story.
 

00:44:03.179 --> 00:44:05.434
Adams says, 'Yes,
the crowd was yelling at the

00:44:05.434 --> 00:44:08.590
troops but they had insulted the
crowd and loaded their guns.

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.335
Yes, they had sticks but
everybody was carrying sticks

00:44:11.335 --> 00:44:14.340
these days because everyone was
scared of the soldiers,

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.065
so everyone naturally walked
around in the streets with

00:44:17.065 --> 00:44:17.570
sticks.'
 

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:19.922
Now maybe that's true,
which tells you a lot about the

00:44:19.922 --> 00:44:22.099
streets of Boston,
or maybe it's not in which case

00:44:22.099 --> 00:44:23.210
it's really creative.
 

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:24.637
[laughter]
'Yes, the crowd hit at the

00:44:24.637 --> 00:44:26.900
soldiers' guns but they were
trying to push them away.'

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.610
So Adams says it's not an
uncontrolled mob;

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:31.829
it's actually a group of people
carrying their normal,

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:33.271
everyday sticks,
[laughter]

00:44:33.271 --> 00:44:36.210
pushing in to hear Captain
Preston answer the question

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.260
about whether or not he was
going to order the troops to

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:39.869
fire.
 

00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:42.135
At this moment,
Adams says, one of the soldiers

00:44:42.135 --> 00:44:44.851
was hit by a stick,
staggered, fired his gun at the

00:44:44.851 --> 00:44:47.849
crowd upon which several
soldiers fired and says Adams,

00:44:47.849 --> 00:44:48.929
'they reloaded their guns.
 

00:44:48.929 --> 00:44:50.780
They were going to fire again.'
 

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.659
Some of the crowd moved away.
 

00:44:52.659 --> 00:44:54.887
One man went up to a soldier
and asked him to his face if he

00:44:54.887 --> 00:44:57.447
was going to fire,
and supposedly the soldier

00:44:57.447 --> 00:44:59.391
said, quote,
"Yes by the eternal

00:44:59.391 --> 00:45:01.750
God" at which point the
colonists knocked him down.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.039
[laughter]
I love all the detail.

00:45:04.039 --> 00:45:07.018
At this point Preston called
out to his men not to fire and

00:45:07.018 --> 00:45:08.748
they stopped,
and here Adams says,

00:45:08.748 --> 00:45:11.056
"I am no Soldier,
and never desired to be one:

00:45:11.056 --> 00:45:13.661
but I appeal to those who are,
whether the words,

00:45:13.661 --> 00:45:17.429
'Don't fire,' are words of
command in the British army;

00:45:17.429 --> 00:45:20.010
and whether there is not some
other word which Soldiers are

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:22.324
taught to understand,
more proper to be given on such

00:45:22.324 --> 00:45:23.170
an occasion ...
 

00:45:23.170 --> 00:45:25.130
which would have prevented such
rashness."

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.507
So here he's saying,
'The guy didn't even call out

00:45:27.507 --> 00:45:28.139
cease fire.
 

00:45:28.139 --> 00:45:31.610
He said, 'Don't. Stop.''
[laughs] Great.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:32.489
Thank you, Captain Preston.
 

00:45:32.489 --> 00:45:34.920
And then Adams describes the
people who died.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:37.565
He makes special note of the
fact that Grey,

00:45:37.565 --> 00:45:41.257
the rope maker who insulted the
sentry by asking him to clean

00:45:41.257 --> 00:45:43.780
the outhouse,
is killed in the clash.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:45.619
Coincidence or murder?
 

00:45:45.619 --> 00:45:49.019
[laughter] Adams is good.
 

00:45:49.019 --> 00:45:50.090
Right?
 

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:52.628
And so here Adams is tossing
out the suggestion that maybe

00:45:52.628 --> 00:45:55.121
the troops were just looking for
an excuse to fire on the

00:45:55.121 --> 00:45:56.989
townspeople--
and then really get that nasty

00:45:56.989 --> 00:45:59.280
Grey--
plotting maybe.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.980
And the British too,
as you've heard,

00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:03.577
are wondering if maybe this is
a plot on the part of the

00:46:03.577 --> 00:46:04.239
colonists.
 

00:46:04.239 --> 00:46:07.059
Maybe they're actually just
trying to rob the customs house

00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:09.880
and this whole thing was an
elaborate ploy by the colonists

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:12.360
just to rob the customs house
behind the guard.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.719
So you can really see from
these two accounts,

00:46:14.719 --> 00:46:17.409
and from the details contained
within them,

00:46:17.409 --> 00:46:20.581
the animosity and the sense of
alienation between the colonists

00:46:20.581 --> 00:46:23.952
and the soldiers on both sides,
and you can also see really

00:46:23.952 --> 00:46:27.643
dramatically the fears on both
sides that there's some kind of

00:46:27.643 --> 00:46:29.541
a plot;
there's some kind of a plot of

00:46:29.541 --> 00:46:31.780
resistance or tyranny,
depending on which side you're

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:32.039
on.
 

00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:35.186
Somehow this is organized and
it's not good and it has to be

00:46:35.186 --> 00:46:38.119
stopped--and both sides have
come to that same point.

00:46:38.119 --> 00:46:41.114
And I will stop there and we
will continue next week on to

00:46:41.114 --> 00:46:42.480
the logic of resistance.
 

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:48.000

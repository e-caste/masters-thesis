00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.500
Today I want to continue
talking about tobacco.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.951
Because tobacco law is a
paradigm for many other problems

00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:10.299
that we've discussed,
but also demonstrates

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:15.552
difficulties of managing the
relationship between freedom of

00:00:15.552 --> 00:00:20.126
choice and freedom of speech,
as well as managing certain

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:22.370
kinds of hazards in the
environment.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.379
And I wanted to refresh your
memory about this idea that this

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.322
industry evolved with the clear
recognition that the product

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:34.331
that they were selling was not
aesthetically appealing on its

00:00:34.331 --> 00:00:35.000
own.
 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.904
So the idea that you would have
to create a cultural preference

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.360
for the product is really
intriguing.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.436
Think about if you were a
corporate leader and you were

00:00:44.436 --> 00:00:47.798
trying to figure out how to
invest your finances to increase

00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:50.650
your sales,
increase your profitability.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.789
Well, you'd wonder about what
forms of advertising you could

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:55.210
use.
 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.911
You'd think carefully about the
way that you would characterize

00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:01.359
hazards as opposed to product
benefits.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.659
And you probably would think
very heavily,

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.969
very carefully about the way
that you would conduct your own

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:07.700
research.
 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.328
And I wanted to reemphasize a
couple of points here.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:15.024
And one is the way that
advertising had been targeted

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:19.144
particularly to those that were
most vulnerable to adopting

00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:22.989
cigarette products,
tobacco products in the early

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:25.197
teens,
really between the ages of

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:27.250
twelve and fifteen years of age.
 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.247
And I also want to bring to
your attention one target of

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:34.663
advertising that I didn't
discuss the other day,

00:01:34.663 --> 00:01:36.480
which is interesting.
 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.105
There is an overlap obviously
between the intensity of

00:01:40.105 --> 00:01:44.072
physical activity among the
young, so that the youngest are

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:45.920
most physically active.
 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.665
And those that participate in
sports became figures that

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:53.410
promoted tobacco use in a
variety of different media.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.061
There was a concentration,
not just to target women and

00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:59.968
ethnic groups,
but also exceptional athletes

00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:02.468
in a variety of different
sports.

00:02:02.468 --> 00:02:04.105
So claims that "They don't
get your wind,"

00:02:04.105 --> 00:02:06.256
as an example,
appeared in Popular

00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:09.468
Mechanics more than half a
century ago.

00:02:09.468 --> 00:02:12.949
I also did not talk about other
kinds of tobacco products,

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:16.540
and it was curious,
because I had a class several

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.030
years ago with perhaps four or
five baseball team players.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.633
And I got to understand that
chewing tobacco is not uncommon

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.590
at all among baseball players.
 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.276
And there's very little
understanding about the chemical

00:02:30.276 --> 00:02:33.492
content or the relative risk of
tobacco products,

00:02:33.492 --> 00:02:36.508
cigarettes as opposed to
smoking tobacco.

00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:42.340
So just to provide a quick
background set of statistics,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.633
the National Cancer Institute
has a site that reviews the

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:48.455
presence of twenty-eight
different carcinogens in

00:02:48.455 --> 00:02:49.750
smokeless tobacco.
 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.771
And one dose of smokeless
tobacco, depending upon the size

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.741
that you pull out of the can,
has three to four times the

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:56.750
nicotine level.
 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.192
So that those that are chewing
tobacco absorb far more nicotine

00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:03.745
and it can be measured at higher
concentrations in the blood than

00:03:03.745 --> 00:03:05.300
if you have a cigarette.
 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.223
And it's now used by almost
eight million people in the

00:03:08.223 --> 00:03:09.090
United States.
 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.777
It's also recognized to
increase risk of oral cancer

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:19.662
that can cause bone degeneration
and different other illnesses of

00:03:19.662 --> 00:03:22.419
the nasopharyngeal cavity.
 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.222
I also did not talk much about
specific advertising targeted to

00:03:27.222 --> 00:03:28.229
young kids.
 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:32.449
But the idea that Big League
Chew chewing gum,

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.050
for example,
would allow a kid to think that

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.075
they were behaving like a Major
Leaguer by chewing bubble gum

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:45.180
the way that the Major Leaguers
chew tobacco.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.532
And also, the sale of
cigarettes in candy form to

00:03:50.532 --> 00:03:51.758
children.
 

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:54.590
These are still marketed in the
United States today.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.673
One other fact that I didn't
discuss is the idea of freedom

00:03:58.673 --> 00:04:02.685
of choice relative to children
growing up in families that

00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:03.460
smoked.
 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.133
I grew up in a family that
smoked, and just have vivid

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:10.808
memories of being in the
backseat of a car filled with

00:04:10.808 --> 00:04:14.554
smoke or sitting around the
kitchen table where parents

00:04:14.554 --> 00:04:19.199
smoked and perhaps some of you
have had that same experience.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.254
The estimate today is about
twenty-five percent of kids

00:04:22.254 --> 00:04:25.591
between the ages of three and
eleven grew up with one smoker

00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:26.778
in the household.
 

00:04:26.778 --> 00:04:30.593
So thinking about the freedom
of choice argument on the part

00:04:30.593 --> 00:04:34.728
of the industry relative to this
population poses some particular

00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:35.569
problems.
 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.846
And I left you the other day
talking about the efforts on the

00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:43.410
part of the industry to
understand nicotine and the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.620
human response to nicotine.
 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.505
And I want you to think about
this a little bit more

00:04:47.505 --> 00:04:47.949
carefully.
 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.749
So this general counsel to
Brown and Williamson back in

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:56.673
1963,
so almost fifty years ago,

00:04:56.673 --> 00:04:59.468
claimed,
"Well, we are then in the

00:04:59.468 --> 00:05:04.528
business of selling nicotine,
an addictive drug."

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:06.649
Beyond nicotine,
by the way, there are many

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:08.970
other hazardous chemicals in
tobacco smoke,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.684
and I'm not going to spend any
more time on this than to let

00:05:12.684 --> 00:05:16.021
you know that dozens of
compounds are really very well

00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:19.168
recognized and they are the
targets of a variety of

00:05:19.168 --> 00:05:21.939
different types of environmental
laws.

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:27.269
So these chemicals are tightly
restricted under the Safe

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:30.853
Drinking Water Act,
the Clean Air Act,

00:05:30.853 --> 00:05:34.730
the hazardous pollutant
regulations.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.973
So that the idea that they
would escape regulatory

00:05:37.973 --> 00:05:42.009
attention in a tobacco product
where the dose would be so much

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:46.113
higher than you would get if you
were exposed to outdoor air to

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:49.819
low levels in drinking water is
really a very interesting

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:50.879
thought.
 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.444
Now, David Kessler,
who wrote Question of

00:05:53.444 --> 00:05:56.233
Intent,
when he spoke in this lecture,

00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:59.817
knew of my interest and the
research I was then doing on

00:05:59.817 --> 00:06:00.730
pesticides.
 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.857
And he pointed me to an expert
in Switzerland,

00:06:03.857 --> 00:06:07.540
who had pulled together
information on pesticides used

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.139
to produce tobacco.
 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.213
So nobody had ever looked at
the number of chemicals that

00:06:12.213 --> 00:06:15.122
were allowed for use or what
happened to them when the

00:06:15.122 --> 00:06:16.550
tobacco itself burned.
 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.988
So it turned out that there are
about 101 different pesticides

00:06:20.988 --> 00:06:22.300
used on tobacco.
 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.555
And when they are burned,
some concentrations make their

00:06:25.555 --> 00:06:28.160
way into indoor air,
but others transform.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.007
So that the mixture of known
carcinogens that are not

00:06:32.007 --> 00:06:36.151
pesticides with these pesticide
metabolites or combustion

00:06:36.151 --> 00:06:39.851
by-products is really quite a
remarkable mixture of

00:06:39.851 --> 00:06:41.110
substances.
 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.911
Now another idea that Kessler
had that I've taken up in a

00:06:44.911 --> 00:06:48.779
variety of different research
projects has been to explore

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.242
patents as a way of
understanding what a corporation

00:06:52.242 --> 00:06:55.976
knew about a product and when
they knew it and how their

00:06:55.976 --> 00:06:59.778
advertising matched up with
their background knowledge of

00:06:59.778 --> 00:07:02.290
benefit as opposed to risk.
 

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.747
So if you look at some of these
patent examples that the Food

00:07:06.747 --> 00:07:11.129
and Drug Administration was able
to conduct research on,

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:15.870
you find that back as early as
the 1960s and through the '70s,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:20.096
'80s, and 1990s,
the companies were conducting

00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:23.949
intensive research on nicotine
content.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.709
So if you take a look at the
first patent description.

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:31.214
And increased nicotine content
in the tobacco smoke by use of a

00:07:31.214 --> 00:07:33.759
nicotine-ion exchange placed in
the filter.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:35.180
What?
 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.329
Placed in the filter?
 

00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:38.458
I thought filters were supposed
to take out particles or

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.310
dangerous chemicals.
 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.529
So they were thinking that they
might even add the nicotine to

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:44.430
the filter.
 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.682
The second, increase nicotine
content in the smoke of a

00:07:47.682 --> 00:07:51.057
tobacco product by adding
nicotine to carbon black in the

00:07:51.057 --> 00:07:51.720
filter.
 

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.680
The next, add tobacco extract
containing nicotine to the

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:55.920
filter of cigarettes.
 

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.889
The next one,
create a device to deliver

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:03.838
increased nicotine by applying
nicotine solution to the filter.

00:08:03.838 --> 00:08:05.608
And finally,
on this sheet,

00:08:05.608 --> 00:08:09.079
method of producing a wrapper
for a smoking rod,

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:12.995
a cigarette,
which has a screen printed on

00:08:12.995 --> 00:08:14.668
it,
among other things,

00:08:14.668 --> 00:08:17.500
a physiologically active agent
such as nicotine.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.560
So thinking about adding ink to
the paper,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:27.000
thinking about adding liquids
and vapors to the filters,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.050
as well as the example that I
described the other day,

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.264
increasing the ammonia content
in the tobacco that would free

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.600
up more nicotine.
 

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.650
So all with an idea to
manipulate the dose that the

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.909
individual would get per
cigarette.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.428
The list goes on.
 

00:08:43.428 --> 00:08:49.620
And the idea of putting other
additives in that would make

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.529
high nicotine content less
harsh,

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:57.273
because nicotine can be very
irritating to the throat and the

00:08:57.273 --> 00:08:57.710
nose.
 

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.687
And also lowering the ratio of
particulate matter of nicotine

00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:04.739
and smoke using internal heat
sinks and special

00:09:04.739 --> 00:09:07.058
nicotine-containing absorbents.
 

00:09:07.058 --> 00:09:10.751
So the cigarette product
itself, many have the idea that

00:09:10.751 --> 00:09:12.230
it's simply tobacco.
 

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.450
It's not at all.
 

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.289
It's a very interesting
combination of different

00:09:16.289 --> 00:09:18.889
technologies,
all designed to manipulate the

00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:21.668
chemical mixture that the smoker
receives.

00:09:21.668 --> 00:09:25.972
And as this research was going
on, the slide that I showed you

00:09:25.972 --> 00:09:30.275
the other day kind of reinforces
that this knowledge was being

00:09:30.275 --> 00:09:34.437
incorporated in a manner that
allowed them to figure out how

00:09:34.437 --> 00:09:38.740
to increase the nicotine content
in cigarettes during the same

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.798
period.
 

00:09:39.798 --> 00:09:46.815
There was an interesting
article that was published in

00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:54.360
1998 by a researcher in the
Tobacco Control Journal.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.940
And it references a memo
that was quoted in that journal.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:00.919
"We are searching
explicitly for a socially

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:04.660
acceptable addictive product
involving a pattern of repeated

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:06.995
consumption,
a product which is likely to

00:10:06.995 --> 00:10:09.807
involve repeated handling,
the essential constituent is

00:10:09.807 --> 00:10:13.370
most likely to be nicotine or a
direct substitute for it."

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:18.014
So this is all just to say that
as these debates were going on

00:10:18.014 --> 00:10:22.508
inside Congress over whether or
not nicotine is an addictive

00:10:22.508 --> 00:10:25.308
drug,
there is a video that I'll put

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:28.980
up on the website for you that
shows all of the tobacco

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.672
executives,
the major corporate executives,

00:10:31.672 --> 00:10:33.129
appearing before Congress.
 

00:10:33.129 --> 00:10:38.172
And one Congressman asked them,
Henry Waxman from California,

00:10:38.172 --> 00:10:41.619
"Gentlemen,
is tobacco or is nicotine

00:10:41.619 --> 00:10:43.298
addictive?"
 

00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:45.534
And each one of them went down
the row, "No,

00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:46.840
it is not addictive."
 

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.565
And this was well after this
research had been published and

00:10:51.565 --> 00:10:54.850
well after this memorandum was
written.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:59.500
So that a central debate in the
management of the technology has

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.379
been over the management of
nicotine.

00:11:02.379 --> 00:11:07.360
Now, by the late 1990s,
major medical organizations

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:13.038
around the world had concluded
that nicotine is addictive,

00:11:13.038 --> 00:11:15.230
including the U.S.
 

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.720
Surgeon General,
the World Health Organization,

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.370
et cetera.
 

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:22.428
So that this eventually
prompted Kessler,

00:11:22.428 --> 00:11:24.957
once he had all of this
information derived from

00:11:24.957 --> 00:11:27.399
patents,
but also derived from National

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:30.546
Institute of Health
independently-conducted research

00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:34.246
and recognizing that there was
much research that had gone on

00:11:34.246 --> 00:11:37.763
in these companies that was
disclosed to the Food and Drug

00:11:37.763 --> 00:11:39.120
Administration.
 

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.029
They developed their proposal.
 

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:44.447
And this proposal is pretty
well laid out in the question of

00:11:44.447 --> 00:11:44.970
intent.
 

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.361
And it included a ban on
cartoon graphics,

00:11:47.361 --> 00:11:51.038
particularly with an eye to the
Joe Camel ad that I showed you a

00:11:51.038 --> 00:11:52.029
few days ago.
 

00:11:52.029 --> 00:11:54.740
Text only is allowed in the
advertising,

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.360
banning brand names on hats,
t-shirts,

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.076
and other products,
they targeted event

00:12:01.076 --> 00:12:04.239
sponsorship,
requiring corporate names but

00:12:04.239 --> 00:12:07.366
not product names,
eliminating vending machines,

00:12:07.366 --> 00:12:09.437
free samples,
and mail order,

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.710
and eliminating self-service in
stores,

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:18.263
and suspending licenses to sell
to those who did not restrict

00:12:18.263 --> 00:12:19.928
sales to minors.
 

00:12:19.928 --> 00:12:23.677
So the history of this FDA rule
is I think very interesting and

00:12:23.677 --> 00:12:27.062
will lead to what I think of as
one of the more important

00:12:27.062 --> 00:12:30.388
success stories in the late
twentieth century that swirl

00:12:30.388 --> 00:12:33.168
around these environmental
health cases.

00:12:33.168 --> 00:12:38.816
The FDA rule proposed in August
of 1996 by President Clinton at

00:12:38.816 --> 00:12:43.369
Kessler's urging was announced
by the Food and Drug

00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:45.100
Administration.
 

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.827
The tobacco industry,
within a matter of a couple of

00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:51.056
months,
filed a lawsuit against the FDA

00:12:51.056 --> 00:12:53.758
rule arguing that the Food and
Drug Administration had no

00:12:53.758 --> 00:12:56.220
authority over tobacco products
under the Food,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:00.118
Drug, and Cosmetic Act,
basically that tobacco products

00:13:00.118 --> 00:13:04.384
were not a drug,
that the cigarettes or the

00:13:04.384 --> 00:13:08.840
cigars were not a drug delivery
device.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:13.745
And they also argued that FDA's
rules on marketing restrictions

00:13:13.745 --> 00:13:16.200
violated the First Amendment.
 

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.327
So we had the right to make
claims about our product and to

00:13:20.327 --> 00:13:21.038
sell it.
 

00:13:21.038 --> 00:13:24.899
The major plaintiffs in the
case included these

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:26.158
corporations.
 

00:13:26.158 --> 00:13:29.799
And as a sideshow,
which is a bit interesting,

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:32.956
back in 1997,
John McCain introduced the

00:13:32.956 --> 00:13:35.950
Universal Tobacco Settlement
Act.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:41.727
And the Senate passed a revised
version of the McCain bill that

00:13:41.727 --> 00:13:45.548
included many elements of the
FDA rule.

00:13:45.548 --> 00:13:48.879
So rather than the government
agency,

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:51.034
the Food and Drug
Administration just adopting

00:13:51.034 --> 00:13:53.908
these regulations without going
specifically to Congress,

00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:57.154
the McCain strategy was,
well let's try to push this

00:13:57.154 --> 00:14:00.080
through Congress and see how far
we can get.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.350
But it was defeated in the
Senate just about a year later.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.879
The U.S.
 

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:10.307
Court of Appeals ruled in a
two-to-one vote that FDA had no

00:14:10.307 --> 00:14:14.048
authority to regulate tobacco
products in 1999.

00:14:14.048 --> 00:14:16.879
Because it ruled that FDA had
no authority,

00:14:16.879 --> 00:14:21.769
the Fourth Circuit did not rule
on whether or not FDA's rules or

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:25.960
marketing restrictions violated
the First Amendment.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.984
And just as a background,
because we haven't spent much

00:14:28.984 --> 00:14:32.120
time on the overall structure of
the judicial system,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.370
there are ninety-four federal
district courts in the U.S.,

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.889
there are ten regional
appellate courts.

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:41.476
And then obviously one Supreme
Court with one justice and eight

00:14:41.476 --> 00:14:42.230
associates.
 

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.719
Now in part because of
recognition of the medical costs

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:51.292
associated with treating people
that had tobacco-related

00:14:51.292 --> 00:14:55.140
illnesses,
attorneys general from more

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:00.440
than forty states got together
and launched a lawsuit.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.028
And this eventually was settled.
 

00:15:03.028 --> 00:15:04.957
It was called the Master
Settlement Agreement with the

00:15:04.957 --> 00:15:05.649
Tobacco Industry.
 

00:15:05.649 --> 00:15:10.857
And as you may or may not know,
most lawsuits don't make their

00:15:10.857 --> 00:15:13.419
way to a trial or to a jury.
 

00:15:13.419 --> 00:15:14.960
Most are settled.
 

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.179
And in this case,
in 1998, the attorneys general

00:15:18.179 --> 00:15:22.222
from forty-six states signed
this agreement with four of the

00:15:22.222 --> 00:15:25.097
biggest companies,
tobacco companies,

00:15:25.097 --> 00:15:26.178
in the nation.
 

00:15:26.178 --> 00:15:30.215
And it prohibited tobacco
advertising that targeted kids

00:15:30.215 --> 00:15:32.928
younger than eighteen years of
age.

00:15:32.928 --> 00:15:35.917
So, once again,
this is kind of an interesting

00:15:35.917 --> 00:15:39.567
story that kids play an
important role in the history of

00:15:39.567 --> 00:15:41.360
the product regulation.
 

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.908
So what were key elements of
this settlement?

00:15:44.908 --> 00:15:49.485
Well, first that tobacco
companies could not use cartoon

00:15:49.485 --> 00:15:54.147
characters, that tobacco
companies could not target youth

00:15:54.147 --> 00:15:56.808
in advertising or promotion.
 

00:15:56.808 --> 00:16:00.317
Tobacco companies could not
sponsor concerts or other events

00:16:00.317 --> 00:16:02.399
with significant youth
audiences.

00:16:02.399 --> 00:16:06.433
And tobacco brand names cannot
be advertised at stadiums and

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:07.048
arenas.
 

00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:12.345
So here you see three different
institutional arenas basically

00:16:12.345 --> 00:16:14.950
considering the same issues.
 

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:20.250
You see the Food and Drug
Administration attempting to

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.750
regulate by adopting
regulations.

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:27.518
And you find the attorneys
general using litigation as a

00:16:27.518 --> 00:16:31.217
way of forcing settlement so
that you get the companies

00:16:31.217 --> 00:16:35.740
themselves to agree that they're
not going to do these things.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.596
That's a very different
approach than having FDA tell

00:16:38.596 --> 00:16:40.740
them that they can't do those
things.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.658
And then you have the McCain
initiative in Congress.

00:16:43.658 --> 00:16:47.986
So the curious thing about this
is that you can think about a

00:16:47.986 --> 00:16:51.666
variety of different
institutional targets for legal

00:16:51.666 --> 00:16:52.460
reform.
 

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.340
Should you target the federal
government?

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.548
Should you target a federal
regulatory agency trying to get

00:16:59.548 --> 00:17:01.870
them to adopt new regulations?
 

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.220
Or should you use the judicial
system.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.699
So that in this case,
all three institutional venues

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:10.720
were being exercised.
 

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.960
I also wanted to pose another
problem to you.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.865
And that is that like other
types of environmental problems,

00:17:18.865 --> 00:17:21.526
there are certain groups in
society that are at special

00:17:21.526 --> 00:17:21.970
risk.
 

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:31.490
And in this case the Americans
with Disabilities Act was used

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:39.583
to eliminate or limit
environmental tobacco smoke in

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:42.440
the workplace.
 

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.089
And it requires that an
employer make a reasonable

00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:48.173
accommodation to the known
disabilities of an employee who

00:17:48.173 --> 00:17:49.848
requests the accommodation.
 

00:17:49.848 --> 00:17:54.250
So that workers used the
Americans with Disabilities Act

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.410
effectively to clear up the air
within workplaces.

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.905
Another settlement proved
interesting, an occupational

00:18:01.905 --> 00:18:03.160
question as well.
 

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:06.743
The airline flight attendants
were concerned about their

00:18:06.743 --> 00:18:09.088
intense exposure to tobacco
smoke.

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:12.436
And you're probably too young
to remember flying when

00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:15.269
cigarette smoking was allowed on
aircraft.

00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:18.827
But the distinction between the
smoking and the no smoking zone

00:18:18.827 --> 00:18:20.318
was simply a row number.
 

00:18:20.318 --> 00:18:24.932
So row number twenty-three and
forward might allow smoking and

00:18:24.932 --> 00:18:28.259
row number twenty-four and back
would not.

00:18:28.259 --> 00:18:31.938
So you could very easily be
sitting next to somebody

00:18:31.938 --> 00:18:32.660
smoking.
 

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.115
And the air inside the cabin is
controlled by the pilot who

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:40.420
decides on what the refresh rate
will be.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.381
It's called bleed air that
comes off of the engines and

00:18:43.381 --> 00:18:45.519
circulates back through the
aircraft.

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:48.815
So that at high altitudes,
the temperature is really low

00:18:48.815 --> 00:18:52.349
so that it means that they have
to expend more fuel the more

00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:55.585
they recycle or refresh the
quality of the air from the

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:59.660
outside to heat it back up to a
comfortable cabin temperature.

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.910
So there's a tendency not to
refresh that air.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.258
There was an interesting case
just a couple of months ago

00:19:05.258 --> 00:19:08.727
about an airliner that had a
fuel leak that had seeped into

00:19:08.727 --> 00:19:12.374
that bleed air and passengers
claimed that they were quite ill

00:19:12.374 --> 00:19:14.951
once they landed,
including many of the flight

00:19:14.951 --> 00:19:15.440
attendants.
 

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.505
So let's take a look at the
Food and Drug Administration

00:19:19.505 --> 00:19:23.126
case versus Brown &amp;
Williamson and the Supreme

00:19:23.126 --> 00:19:26.750
Court ruling on March of 2000
that was issued in a

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.818
five-to-four decision.
 

00:19:28.818 --> 00:19:31.977
This was interesting,
because it basically concluded

00:19:31.977 --> 00:19:35.506
that existing law does not
provide FDA with authority over

00:19:35.506 --> 00:19:37.548
tobacco or tobacco marketing.
 

00:19:37.548 --> 00:19:41.950
They claimed that FDA
consistently stated before 1995

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.588
that it lacked jurisdiction over
tobacco.

00:19:45.588 --> 00:19:48.242
So the shift in the
administrator of the Food and

00:19:48.242 --> 00:19:50.343
Drug Administration,
they were arguing,

00:19:50.343 --> 00:19:53.660
was the only reason that they
were taking this issue on.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.301
And the Congress had enacted
several tobacco-specific

00:19:57.301 --> 00:20:01.714
statutes that fully demonstrated
that they had not intended that

00:20:01.714 --> 00:20:05.989
these regulations proposed by
the Food and Drug Administration

00:20:05.989 --> 00:20:07.180
be adopted.
 

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.202
So Congress considered and
rejected many bills that would

00:20:10.202 --> 00:20:12.308
have given the agency that
authority.

00:20:12.308 --> 00:20:15.721
So the argument that the
Supreme Court bought was that

00:20:15.721 --> 00:20:19.650
this was a matter that should
have been dealt with in Congress

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.825
specifically,
but Congress chose not to deal

00:20:22.825 --> 00:20:23.430
with it.
 

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:26.910
So what if you look more
carefully at it?

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:28.604
Well what if you ask the
question, well,

00:20:28.604 --> 00:20:30.819
should it be considered to be a
drug under the Food,

00:20:30.819 --> 00:20:31.950
Drug and Cosmetic Act?
 

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:37.596
And you might read the
statement by an RJ Reynolds

00:20:37.596 --> 00:20:38.980
executive.
 

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:41.309
"In a sense,
the tobacco industry may be

00:20:41.309 --> 00:20:43.269
thought of as being a
specialized,

00:20:43.269 --> 00:20:46.041
highly ritualized and stylized
segment of the pharmaceutical

00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:46.558
industry.
 

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:49.449
Tobacco products uniquely
contain and delivery nicotine,

00:20:49.449 --> 00:20:52.548
a potent drug with a variety of
physiological effects,"

00:20:52.548 --> 00:20:53.809
and say case closed.
 

00:20:53.809 --> 00:20:55.538
You know, the evidence is clear.
 

00:20:55.538 --> 00:20:59.455
They even believe themselves
that tobacco products should be

00:20:59.455 --> 00:21:01.778
classified or are a type of
drug.

00:21:01.778 --> 00:21:04.071
Well, the decision,
as the Supreme Court

00:21:04.071 --> 00:21:06.570
interpreted it,
and don't forget that this was

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.949
a five-to-four decision,
which is interesting,

00:21:08.949 --> 00:21:12.285
because the dissenting opinions
are something that you probably

00:21:12.285 --> 00:21:13.200
have not read.
 

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.189
But I commend to you the
opinion of Steven Breyer,

00:21:17.189 --> 00:21:20.690
which I think is perhaps the
most cogent.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:25.395
So that the definition of a
drug turned out to be dependent

00:21:25.395 --> 00:21:29.695
in turn about whether or not
there was an identifiable

00:21:29.695 --> 00:21:30.670
benefit.
 

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:34.125
So, and I'm going to quote:
"Various provisions in the

00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:36.690
Act require the agency to
determine that at least for some

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.836
consumers,
the product's therapeutic

00:21:38.836 --> 00:21:42.595
benefits outweigh the risks of
illness or serious injury...This

00:21:42.595 --> 00:21:45.567
the FDA cannot do,
because tobacco products are

00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:48.259
unsafe for obtaining any
therapeutic benefit.

00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:51.453
The inescapable conclusion is
that there is no room for

00:21:51.453 --> 00:21:53.819
tobacco products within the
FDCA's, Food,

00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:56.660
Drug, and Cosmetic Act's,
regulatory scheme.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.076
If they cannot be used safely
for any therapeutic purpose and

00:22:00.076 --> 00:22:03.363
yet they cannot be banned,
they simply do not fit"

00:22:03.363 --> 00:22:05.990
the legal scheme that Congress
had intended.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.233
And Sandra Day O'Connor wrote
this opinion:

00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:11.440
"The agency has amply
demonstrated that tobacco use,

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:13.170
particularly among children and
adolescents,

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:15.909
poses perhaps the single most
significant threat to public

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:17.640
health in the United
States."

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.434
Yet, "we believe that
Congress has clearly precluded

00:22:20.434 --> 00:22:22.931
FDA from asserting jurisdiction
to regulate tobacco

00:22:22.931 --> 00:22:23.880
products."
 

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.589
Now many people heard about
this decision and they assumed

00:22:27.589 --> 00:22:30.650
that the Supreme Court was off
their rocker,

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:34.843
that they really were
concluding something that was

00:22:34.843 --> 00:22:36.940
not morally defensible.
 

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.547
But their job is not to
conclude what is morally

00:22:40.547 --> 00:22:43.308
appropriate or morally
defensible.

00:22:43.308 --> 00:22:47.894
Their job is to determine
whether or not an agency action

00:22:47.894 --> 00:22:52.970
in this case complied with the
intent and letter of the law.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.632
So that it's important to
recognize that these are debates

00:22:56.632 --> 00:22:59.009
about the nature and the
language,

00:22:59.009 --> 00:23:02.303
the very specific language and
definitions contained in the

00:23:02.303 --> 00:23:05.256
statutes that provide the
authorizing language to the

00:23:05.256 --> 00:23:07.826
administrative agency,
such as the Food and Drug

00:23:07.826 --> 00:23:08.490
Administration.
 

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.243
So that continuing with this
opinion: "Congress has

00:23:12.243 --> 00:23:14.769
foreclosed a ban on such
products,

00:23:14.769 --> 00:23:17.159
choosing instead to create a
distinct regulatory scheme

00:23:17.159 --> 00:23:19.681
focusing on the labeling and
advertising of cigarettes and

00:23:19.681 --> 00:23:20.920
smokeless tobacco."
 

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.855
Compared to pesticides,
where they created a scheme

00:23:24.855 --> 00:23:29.355
that now stands that the agency,
in that case the Environmental

00:23:29.355 --> 00:23:32.394
Protection Agency,
has to make a formal finding of

00:23:32.394 --> 00:23:34.390
reasonable certainty of no harm.
 

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:35.809
Not in this case.
 

00:23:35.809 --> 00:23:37.779
Not in this case at all.
 

00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:40.910
So that the focus on labeling
and advertising,

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.740
rather than on risk assessment
or risk minimization,

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.021
is a very different approach to
managing a product or a

00:23:48.021 --> 00:23:50.558
technology in the marketplace.
 

00:23:50.558 --> 00:23:53.500
So its express policy is to
protect commerce and the

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.904
national economy while informing
consumers about any adverse

00:23:56.904 --> 00:23:58.000
health effects.
 

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.978
Now, one might argue as well,
well, how did the tobacco

00:24:00.978 --> 00:24:03.348
industry get away with this
legal regime?

00:24:03.348 --> 00:24:07.650
How were they so successful in
escaping regulation?

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.509
It's almost the ideal situation.
 

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:14.273
So that they have the sense of
being regulated because of the

00:24:14.273 --> 00:24:18.380
advertising controls,
but they have virtual freedom

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.778
to manipulate the chemical
composition of their products.

00:24:22.778 --> 00:24:24.358
So that if I were a tobacco
executive,

00:24:24.358 --> 00:24:27.489
I would think that legal regime
is pretty good and I would

00:24:27.489 --> 00:24:30.782
definitely defend against any
change in the legal regime that

00:24:30.782 --> 00:24:34.241
would increase the authority of
the Food and Drug Administration

00:24:34.241 --> 00:24:35.890
on the part of Congress.
 

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:41.670
So Justice Breyer's dissent on
FDA's authority is interesting.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:44.154
So: "According to the FDA,
only 2.5 percent of smokers

00:24:44.154 --> 00:24:46.190
successfully stop smoking each
year,

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.892
even though seventy percent say
they want to quit and

00:24:48.892 --> 00:24:51.904
thirty-four percent actually
make an attempt to do so...The

00:24:51.904 --> 00:24:54.815
fact that only a handful of
those who try to quit smoking

00:24:54.815 --> 00:24:57.568
actually succeed illustrates a
certain reality.

00:24:57.568 --> 00:25:00.794
The reality that the nicotine
in cigarettes creates a powerful

00:25:00.794 --> 00:25:04.070
physiological addiction flowing
from chemically-induced changes

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.084
in the brain...The FDA found
that the makers of cigarettes

00:25:07.084 --> 00:25:10.397
intend these physical effects,
hence nicotine is a drug,

00:25:10.397 --> 00:25:13.442
the cigarette that delivers the
nicotine to the body is a

00:25:13.442 --> 00:25:15.428
device,
and the FDCA's language,

00:25:15.428 --> 00:25:17.568
read in light of its basic
purpose,

00:25:17.568 --> 00:25:20.157
permits the Food and Drug
Administration to assert the

00:25:20.157 --> 00:25:22.598
disease-preventing jurisdiction
that the agency now

00:25:22.598 --> 00:25:23.430
claims."
 

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.532
So the issue seemed like it was
over until the Obama

00:25:27.532 --> 00:25:32.520
administration came into power
and all of these provisions that

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.865
had been in the proposed
regulations on the part of the

00:25:36.865 --> 00:25:41.532
Food and Drug Administration
made their way into bills that

00:25:41.532 --> 00:25:46.200
were introduced to the House and
the Senate that eventually

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.625
became the Family Smoking
Prevention and Tobacco Control

00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:53.200
Act in June of 2009.
 

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:59.029
So this bill adopted by
Congress amends the Food,

00:25:59.029 --> 00:26:02.088
Drug, and Cosmetic Act to grant
the Food and Drug Administration

00:26:02.088 --> 00:26:04.078
authority to regulate the
advertising,

00:26:04.078 --> 00:26:06.410
marketing, and manufacturing of
tobacco products.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.250
What does it do?
 

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.759
Well, it restricts tobacco
marketing and sales to youth.

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:15.420
It bans all outdoor advertising
within 1,000 feet of schools.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:20.553
It bans free giveaways of any
non-tobacco items with the

00:26:20.553 --> 00:26:23.538
purchase of a tobacco product.
 

00:26:23.538 --> 00:26:26.311
It bans the sponsorship of
sporting events and

00:26:26.311 --> 00:26:27.730
entertainment events.
 

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.654
It limits to black and white
text only advertising in

00:26:30.654 --> 00:26:33.919
publications with significant
teen readership and restricts

00:26:33.919 --> 00:26:36.394
vending machines and
self-service displays to

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:37.970
adult-only facilities.
 

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:41.952
And it continues to require
retailers to verify age for all

00:26:41.952 --> 00:26:43.670
over-the-counter sales.
 

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:48.240
By the way, I didn't mention a
point that I meant to earlier.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.348
You know, we had talked about
preemption before.

00:26:50.348 --> 00:26:53.594
And under the different
statutes that we've looked at

00:26:53.594 --> 00:26:56.776
when would the federal
government preempt or prevent

00:26:56.776 --> 00:27:00.269
states from adopting different
kinds of regulations?

00:27:00.269 --> 00:27:03.886
Well preemption turns out to be
an important component in this

00:27:03.886 --> 00:27:07.088
case as well with respect to the
tobacco settlement.

00:27:07.088 --> 00:27:12.137
Now the tobacco settlement was
not law that was formed by

00:27:12.137 --> 00:27:13.038
statute.
 

00:27:13.038 --> 00:27:16.098
It was not formed by
regulation, it was formed by

00:27:16.098 --> 00:27:19.666
agreement between attorneys
general of the states and the

00:27:19.666 --> 00:27:21.068
tobacco companies.
 

00:27:21.068 --> 00:27:25.355
But the states started to
enforce the provisions of that

00:27:25.355 --> 00:27:29.328
settlement that brought the
questions into court.

00:27:29.328 --> 00:27:32.403
And some states,
such as Massachusetts and

00:27:32.403 --> 00:27:36.980
California, proposed advertising
that was distinctive and more

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.180
restrictive.
 

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.141
Outdoor advertising bans so
that no billboards could be

00:27:41.141 --> 00:27:43.991
located within 1,000 feet of a
school in the state of

00:27:43.991 --> 00:27:44.980
Massachusetts.
 

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:49.940
Similar kinds of legislation in
a variety of different states.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.755
So that the Supreme Court
considered this in the 2000

00:27:54.755 --> 00:27:59.384
decision and it basically
reinforced the preemption

00:27:59.384 --> 00:28:05.220
provision that was part of a
variety of different statutes.

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.749
So that the court found that
preemption would prevent

00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:12.442
Massachusetts,
California, and other states

00:28:12.442 --> 00:28:14.778
from adopting more rigorous
advertising restrictions.

00:28:14.778 --> 00:28:16.808
It's just kind of an
interesting point,

00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:20.845
how the attorneys general could
draw the settlement issue back

00:28:20.845 --> 00:28:24.482
into court and then it would
capture the Supreme Court's

00:28:24.482 --> 00:28:25.410
attention.
 

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.365
So that basically,
you see the language being

00:28:28.365 --> 00:28:31.924
moved from the Food and Drug
Administration's proposed

00:28:31.924 --> 00:28:34.680
regulations into statutory
language,

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.980
and this was blessed by
Congress.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.911
It provides FDA with authority
to develop regulations that

00:28:40.911 --> 00:28:44.498
restrict advertising and
promotion to the full extent

00:28:44.498 --> 00:28:48.567
permitted by amendment to the
Constitution and it requires a

00:28:48.567 --> 00:28:52.499
detailed disclosure of tobacco
product ingredients for the

00:28:52.499 --> 00:28:53.808
first time.
 

00:28:53.808 --> 00:28:58.919
So the tobacco companies have
to disclose not just chemicals

00:28:58.919 --> 00:29:03.656
used for the growing of tobacco,
but the chemicals in the

00:29:03.656 --> 00:29:06.528
tobacco plants themselves,
whether or not they're

00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:09.042
genetically modified,
and what kinds of additives

00:29:09.042 --> 00:29:11.622
they placed,
not just in the tobacco but in

00:29:11.622 --> 00:29:13.548
the filter as well as the paper.
 

00:29:13.548 --> 00:29:19.942
It also requires the FDA to
require changes to tobacco that

00:29:19.942 --> 00:29:23.250
would protect public health.
 

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:27.651
So public health now is a
decision-making standard that

00:29:27.651 --> 00:29:32.213
has to be viewed and treated
with every decision that FDA

00:29:32.213 --> 00:29:33.029
makes.
 

00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:39.266
Oh, and one critical aspect of
this new statute is that FDA is

00:29:39.266 --> 00:29:42.786
now allowed,
granted the authority to reduce

00:29:42.786 --> 00:29:46.501
nicotine content or to ban
ingredients that it believes are

00:29:46.501 --> 00:29:49.076
hazardous,
but it's not allowed to require

00:29:49.076 --> 00:29:52.160
the reduction of nicotine to
zero or to ban any particular

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.342
class of products,
say cigars or chewing tobacco

00:29:56.342 --> 00:29:57.890
as an example.
 

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:01.497
It also controlled,
gives, FDA the authority to

00:30:01.497 --> 00:30:06.201
control reduced-harm products so
that the descriptors such as

00:30:06.201 --> 00:30:09.025
"light"
or "mild"

00:30:09.025 --> 00:30:12.554
or "low"
on labels or in advertising

00:30:12.554 --> 00:30:17.259
will now become subject to the
review of the agency.

00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:21.981
You'll remember that the light
products that I showed you last

00:30:21.981 --> 00:30:26.472
Tuesday had higher nicotine
content in them than the normal

00:30:26.472 --> 00:30:27.480
products.
 

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.915
And it requires larger and more
specific health warnings to

00:30:30.915 --> 00:30:34.588
cover the top fifty percent of
the front and rear panels of the

00:30:34.588 --> 00:30:35.298
package.
 

00:30:35.298 --> 00:30:39.161
And it directs the FDA to issue
a rule requiring graphic

00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:42.250
warnings on labels within a year
from now.

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.534
So recall the Canadian
government's tobacco labeling

00:30:46.534 --> 00:30:48.970
requirements as an example.
 

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:53.541
Curiously, they also transfer
the costs of all regulation back

00:30:53.541 --> 00:30:57.815
to the companies so that all
tobacco-related Food and Drug

00:30:57.815 --> 00:31:01.863
Administration costs now have to
be allocated among the

00:31:01.863 --> 00:31:05.986
manufacturers of cigarette
tobacco and smokeless tobacco

00:31:05.986 --> 00:31:08.460
products sold in the U.S.
 

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.838
based upon their different
shares of the marketplace.

00:31:11.838 --> 00:31:15.510
So in this interim time between
when the Food and Drug

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:19.390
Administration was found by the
Supreme Court not to have

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.269
authority to move forward on
tobacco and when in 2009 the

00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:26.039
Congress adopted the new
statute,

00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:27.480
what was happening?
 

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.699
Well, states became very active
in their own tobacco control

00:31:30.699 --> 00:31:31.298
programs.
 

00:31:31.298 --> 00:31:34.798
And these programs turned out
to be really remarkable social

00:31:34.798 --> 00:31:35.630
experiments.
 

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.769
They turned out to be quite
effective.

00:31:37.769 --> 00:31:39.833
In California,
adult smoking dropped from

00:31:39.833 --> 00:31:42.929
twenty-six percent to eighteen
percent in about an eight-year

00:31:42.929 --> 00:31:45.868
period following a variety of
educational campaigns,

00:31:45.868 --> 00:31:49.250
public service announcements,
school programs.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:54.296
So that Massachusetts similarly
found a thirty-one percent

00:31:54.296 --> 00:31:57.130
decline between 1992 and 1999.
 

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.490
In Oregon, tobacco use fell
eleven percent.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.179
In Florida in one year,
teen smoking had gone down the

00:32:05.179 --> 00:32:08.098
fastest that it had since 1980.
 

00:32:08.098 --> 00:32:10.910
The key elements have been mass
media campaigns,

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:14.498
smoking bans and restrictions,
particularly in public places,

00:32:14.498 --> 00:32:16.890
in buildings as well as
restaurants.

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.375
Price increases,
they found that tobacco

00:32:20.375 --> 00:32:25.380
adoption rates were extremely
sensitive to tax levels.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.766
So in the states that had the
most elevated taxes,

00:32:27.766 --> 00:32:29.519
you had the lowest adoption
rates.

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:34.608
In states that had the highest
intensity of bans on place-based

00:32:34.608 --> 00:32:37.809
restrictions,
restrictions in buildings,

00:32:37.809 --> 00:32:41.338
they had the highest rates of
quitting.

00:32:41.338 --> 00:32:45.351
So that price sensitivity
turned out to be a really

00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:48.400
important component of the
strategy.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.971
And they also found that
different types of physician

00:32:51.971 --> 00:32:54.948
interventions--
nicotine patches--were much

00:32:54.948 --> 00:32:58.565
more effective when they were
combined with these other

00:32:58.565 --> 00:33:02.250
educational programs than they
had earlier believed.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:06.460
So basically another lesson
here is that mass media works.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.501
And remember the 1967 Fairness
Doctrine campaign that itself

00:33:11.501 --> 00:33:15.519
resulted in a significant
decline in smoking.

00:33:15.519 --> 00:33:18.650
In California,
the media campaign reduced

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:23.189
sales of cigarettes by 232
million packs in only a two-year

00:33:23.189 --> 00:33:24.048
period.
 

00:33:24.048 --> 00:33:27.265
And when media spending dropped
from sixteen million to six

00:33:27.265 --> 00:33:29.759
million, the program became less
effective.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:34.048
So that education is really
important and it works.

00:33:34.048 --> 00:33:39.048
Well, I want to step back from
this case and I want you to

00:33:39.048 --> 00:33:43.519
think about how this history
should be conceived.

00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:46.430
Should you be thinking about
this as a success story?

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.954
Should you be thinking about
this as offering other lessons

00:33:49.954 --> 00:33:52.630
for other kinds of environmental
problems?

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:56.740
And I've got a number of
students that went to Copenhagen

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.777
in December and came back
throwing their hands up in the

00:34:00.777 --> 00:34:04.740
air not knowing really what
happened and feeling rather

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:09.438
disillusioned with the inability
of nations to decide to agree on

00:34:09.438 --> 00:34:13.695
what level of carbon in the
atmosphere should be allowed or

00:34:13.695 --> 00:34:17.364
what the rate of use of
alternative forms of energy

00:34:17.364 --> 00:34:18.980
should be.
 

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.422
And this history,
as well as the other histories

00:34:21.422 --> 00:34:24.592
that I've showed you that you've
read about through the term I

00:34:24.592 --> 00:34:27.657
think should give you some sense
that legal reform is a long

00:34:27.657 --> 00:34:28.230
road.
 

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.626
It demands education,
it demands a shift in values

00:34:32.626 --> 00:34:37.922
and it demands willingness on
the part of those that are the

00:34:37.922 --> 00:34:39.728
culprits,
so to speak,

00:34:39.728 --> 00:34:42.612
the people that are behaving in
a way that adversely effects the

00:34:42.612 --> 00:34:43.300
environment.
 

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.434
It requires them to internalize
the values that are imbedded in

00:34:46.434 --> 00:34:48.659
the law, otherwise it's not
going to work.

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:54.074
So I view this as one of the
greatest examples we've got

00:34:54.074 --> 00:35:00.275
about how science had moved out
of the tobacco industry into the

00:35:00.275 --> 00:35:04.510
public sector funded by the
government.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.766
A very different view evolved
of what was risky and what was

00:35:08.766 --> 00:35:09.199
not.
 

00:35:09.199 --> 00:35:12.157
A different quality of
knowledge developed about the

00:35:12.157 --> 00:35:13.840
nature of the health risks.
 

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.978
And it eventually led the
public to realize that this was

00:35:17.978 --> 00:35:20.639
a technology,
this was a product that

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:23.449
demanded greater public
attention.

00:35:23.449 --> 00:35:25.735
And you can think of the
parallels between nuclear

00:35:25.735 --> 00:35:27.880
weapons testing,
think of the parallels between

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.579
pesticides.
 

00:35:28.579 --> 00:35:31.170
So once again, I'm not Dr.
 

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.842
Doom and Gloom,
I'm showing you examples in

00:35:33.842 --> 00:35:37.789
history that I think are really
remarkable success stories,

00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:39.360
such as the Limited Test Ban
Treaty,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.889
the Food Quality Protection
Act, and in this case,

00:35:42.889 --> 00:35:44.768
the statute that was just
passed.

00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:50.360
Now when you discuss this in
your sections this week,

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.050
you probably will think about
different strategies that might

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:57.619
be applied to control tobacco
and how the freedom to choose

00:35:57.619 --> 00:35:59.280
should best be limited.
 

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.929
So I'm going to do my own
little survey here.

00:36:01.929 --> 00:36:06.043
How many people here think that
the control of advertising is an

00:36:06.043 --> 00:36:09.766
appropriate way to control
tobacco products and associated

00:36:09.766 --> 00:36:10.420
risks?
 

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.094
How many people feel that
individuals ought to have the

00:36:14.094 --> 00:36:18.110
right to choose whether or not
they use tobacco products?

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:23.353
How many people feel that
tobacco products should be

00:36:23.353 --> 00:36:24.280
banned?
 

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.907
Well, I'd say maybe eight to
ten percent of you think that

00:36:28.907 --> 00:36:31.829
tobacco products should be
banned.

00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:34.530
There's remarkable consistency
year to year.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:37.159
I've asked this question for
the past decade in this class.

00:36:37.159 --> 00:36:39.980
And the number of people that
believe that,

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.420
for example,
DDT or other hazardous air

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:49.125
pollutants or pesticides should
be banned is normally far higher

00:36:49.125 --> 00:36:51.570
than it is for tobacco.
 

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.369
So explaining why that is is
really quite interesting.

00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:57.393
And I think that the
advertising schemes that I

00:36:57.393 --> 00:37:01.206
displayed to you over the past
couple of lectures play some

00:37:01.206 --> 00:37:05.282
role in having shaped cultural
attitudes and acceptance of this

00:37:05.282 --> 00:37:09.030
technology in ways that really
is quite remarkable.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.217
Now, I want you to think about
the nature of the politics too,

00:37:12.217 --> 00:37:14.360
in the last few minutes of the
lecture.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.278
What do you know,
what could you say about the

00:37:17.278 --> 00:37:21.106
forms of argument that we've
seen across the different cases

00:37:21.106 --> 00:37:22.730
that we've looked at?
 

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:25.239
How are they consistent and how
are they different?

00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:28.737
Well first, I'd like you to
take a look at some of the key

00:37:28.737 --> 00:37:31.070
industry arguments that we've
seen,

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:35.541
where the promoter of the
product, the promoter of the

00:37:35.541 --> 00:37:38.710
service,
the promoter of the technology,

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:42.394
the promoter of national
security in the case of the

00:37:42.394 --> 00:37:46.369
weapons testing or the War Games
testing in Vieques.

00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:49.389
They emphasize the benefit of
the product or technology or the

00:37:49.389 --> 00:37:52.012
social demand for it as the
logic for why it should be

00:37:52.012 --> 00:37:53.199
allowed to continue.
 

00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:56.914
They argue that evidence is
insufficient to justify

00:37:56.914 --> 00:37:57.880
regulation.
 

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.630
They play the good scientist.
 

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:03.302
They develop the science
in-house and then present their

00:38:03.302 --> 00:38:06.440
interpretations of it to the
regulatory body.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:11.150
The industry or proponent would
trivialize claims of hazards and

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.739
compare the hazards always to
natural hazards.

00:38:14.739 --> 00:38:18.539
Like, we experience risks from
flying across the country from

00:38:18.539 --> 00:38:19.300
radiation.
 

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.981
So the radionuclides in our
milk are relatively

00:38:23.981 --> 00:38:25.610
insignificant.
 

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:29.443
So figure out ways of
trivializing risk by using

00:38:29.443 --> 00:38:31.239
comparative metrics.
 

00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:32.469
Exposure.
 

00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:37.054
You find consistently across
these cases that exposure is

00:38:37.054 --> 00:38:40.739
often averaged among different
populations.

00:38:40.739 --> 00:38:44.768
It's averaged over time,
it's averaged over space,

00:38:44.768 --> 00:38:47.400
it's averaged demographically.
 

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.610
And this act of averaging,
when you have a really--

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.699
the image is really one of
pockets of risk,

00:38:55.699 --> 00:38:59.530
the averaging is going to
compress peoples' perception of

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:01.719
and the magnitude of the risk.
 

00:39:01.719 --> 00:39:04.949
So paying attention to the
distribution of risk has been

00:39:04.949 --> 00:39:08.179
very important to legal reform
in all of these cases.

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.809
Age restrictions also.
 

00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:13.385
The role of kids,
the concern of society for the

00:39:13.385 --> 00:39:15.025
very young,
for the fetus,

00:39:15.025 --> 00:39:16.630
for the kids,
for future generations,

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:22.012
this is an appeal on the part
of consumers that is often quite

00:39:22.012 --> 00:39:26.690
effective and leads industry to
still fight a ban,

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:30.789
like to fight prohibition,
but to accept age restrictions,

00:39:30.789 --> 00:39:33.532
to accept labeling,
to accept training requirements

00:39:33.532 --> 00:39:35.070
or licensing requirements.
 

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.518
So the strategy,
if you are the corporate

00:39:37.518 --> 00:39:39.601
executive, is to well,
fight those,

00:39:39.601 --> 00:39:43.460
but to accept them instead of
taking a product prohibition.

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.670
Registration is a property
right.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.476
They will always fight that if
you take away the right to do

00:39:49.476 --> 00:39:52.380
what they did in the past that
you have to compensate for them

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.760
under the Fifth Amendment of the
Constitution.

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:58.391
So treat your registration,
treat your past freedom to

00:39:58.391 --> 00:40:02.434
sell, your freedom to choose,
as a property right and demand

00:40:02.434 --> 00:40:03.599
compensation.
 

00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:06.706
And courts have traditionally
responded favorably to these

00:40:06.706 --> 00:40:07.360
arguments.
 

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.954
Patent life,
push for the longest patent

00:40:10.954 --> 00:40:12.800
life that you can.
 

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.239
And you basically want to fight
regulation until the end of your

00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:18.315
patent life,
which at that time,

00:40:18.315 --> 00:40:21.465
the product becomes generic,
it can be picked up by other

00:40:21.465 --> 00:40:22.050
corporations.
 

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:24.679
You find this with pesticides,
you find this with drugs.

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:27.182
So that the industry will fight
to keep the product in the

00:40:27.182 --> 00:40:29.159
marketplace until the end of
that patent life,

00:40:29.159 --> 00:40:30.829
which is now a twenty-year
period.

00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:34.405
And you often find litigation
effective in delaying

00:40:34.405 --> 00:40:37.480
prohibitions for fifteen to
twenty years.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.789
So it's a very effective
strategy.

00:40:38.789 --> 00:40:41.889
And often--if you've invested
say a hundred million dollars,

00:40:41.889 --> 00:40:44.483
there was one pesticide that I
worked on where a hundred

00:40:44.483 --> 00:40:47.452
million dollars was invested in
this chemical to bring it to the

00:40:47.452 --> 00:40:50.202
marketplace and to study it--
if you've invested that amount

00:40:50.202 --> 00:40:52.250
of money,
it often takes you to

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:56.545
seventy-five percent of the
patent life to start to get a

00:40:56.545 --> 00:40:58.768
return on that investment.
 

00:40:58.768 --> 00:41:00.719
So the profitability for new
drug,

00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:04.780
the profitability for a new
expensive technology,

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.960
expensive to bring to the
marketplace,

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:09.630
it often doesn't pay off until
that last five-year period.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.989
So that's a guarantee that
you're going to have a legal

00:41:11.989 --> 00:41:12.340
fight.
 

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.518
Strategically regulate rather
than ban.

00:41:15.518 --> 00:41:20.172
Argue that well,
can I use the product in this

00:41:20.172 --> 00:41:22.550
way but not that way?
 

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:26.860
Can I continue to sell the
tobacco in cigarettes if not

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:27.579
cigars?
 

00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:31.900
Could I continue to use a
pesticide outdoors if you ban it

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:32.659
indoors?
 

00:41:32.659 --> 00:41:36.311
So try to maintain market share
anyway that you can,

00:41:36.311 --> 00:41:39.750
and if you can't,
if they decide no it's going to

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:42.400
be banned, then let us export
it.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.000
Please let us export it to
other nations.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.938
Substitutes,
don't compare us among

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:49.150
competitors.
 

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.494
Make sure that you focus
exclusively on our product

00:41:52.494 --> 00:41:56.534
because we don't want the risk,
the threat, the environmental

00:41:56.534 --> 00:42:00.244
damage from our product to be
thought of an in an additive way

00:42:00.244 --> 00:42:02.070
with competitors' products.
 

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:05.710
Another logic is comparative
risk.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:09.960
Well, the risk associated with
our product or our behavior or

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.139
our technology is really minimal
compared to the risk of not

00:42:14.139 --> 00:42:17.610
using the latest safety
technology in a car,

00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:21.420
trying to launch a suicide
prevention program,

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.360
a drug control program,
etcetera.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.291
Finally, self-study,
self-monitoring and

00:42:27.291 --> 00:42:28.570
self-reporting.
 

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.550
Let us do the studies and then
provide you with the data.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.429
Don't set up an independent
organization to do that.

00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:40.391
So let us report not only on
the nature of the danger but

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:44.494
also on its distribution and
what its cost to society might

00:42:44.494 --> 00:42:44.989
be.
 

00:42:44.989 --> 00:42:48.869
Now how about the environmental
and consumer groups' arguments?

00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:50.480
How would they respond?
 

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.639
Well, their response has been
pretty consistent.

00:42:53.639 --> 00:42:57.188
Let's shift the burden of proof
back to the private sector to

00:42:57.188 --> 00:42:58.429
demonstrate safety.
 

00:42:58.429 --> 00:43:02.052
Why should the public have the
burden to demonstrate danger in

00:43:02.052 --> 00:43:03.300
all of these cases?
 

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.300
It takes too long and you often
can't demonstrate danger.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:12.737
So let's have the expense,
the time and the burden to rest

00:43:12.737 --> 00:43:15.449
on the private sector.
 

00:43:15.449 --> 00:43:18.731
Second, they'll argue that
evidence is insufficient to

00:43:18.731 --> 00:43:20.280
justify finding safety.
 

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.228
So they will delay for the same
reasons that industry would

00:43:23.228 --> 00:43:26.128
delay, saying that the evidence
is insufficient to justify

00:43:26.128 --> 00:43:27.400
increased regulation.
 

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:33.114
But if this burden of proof is
switched, it's basically

00:43:33.114 --> 00:43:39.360
providing a mirror image to the
former regulatory regime.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.699
Susceptibility.
 

00:43:40.699 --> 00:43:43.659
Think about how susceptibility
varies in the population.

00:43:43.659 --> 00:43:47.503
Again, all the cases that we've
looked at in the course so far

00:43:47.503 --> 00:43:50.655
have involved those that are
especially vulnerable,

00:43:50.655 --> 00:43:53.050
those that are especially
exposed.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:58.139
So look at exposure patterns
and how they vary by age class.

00:43:58.139 --> 00:44:00.340
Look at variability by
ethnicity.

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.940
Look at differences in use
patterns or behavior among

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.398
different ethnic groups,
perhaps in different seasons,

00:44:07.398 --> 00:44:09.809
perhaps in different parts of
the country,

00:44:09.809 --> 00:44:13.778
so that looking at variability
and how that plays out in how

00:44:13.778 --> 00:44:17.817
goods and bads are distributed
is really important to all the

00:44:17.817 --> 00:44:18.489
cases.
 

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.369
Think about mixtures.
 

00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:24.016
Don't just regulate single
products or single compounds,

00:44:24.016 --> 00:44:27.199
but think about regulating the
entire mixture.

00:44:27.199 --> 00:44:30.130
We've seen that with respect to
diesel exhaust.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:32.389
Tobacco smoke is another good
example.

00:44:32.389 --> 00:44:35.125
It's the mixture that's being
regulated, not the individual

00:44:35.125 --> 00:44:37.199
component, with the exception of
nicotine.

00:44:37.199 --> 00:44:39.099
Aggregated exposure.
 

00:44:39.099 --> 00:44:42.452
So think about where you might
get exposed to the same kind of

00:44:42.452 --> 00:44:44.760
threat from a variety of
different sources,

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.739
from air, from water from
foods.

00:44:46.739 --> 00:44:49.070
Think about the pace of review.
 

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:54.871
Make sure that if you give an
agency a burden to transform an

00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:59.900
industrial sector from being
risky to being safe,

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:02.949
what's the pace of review that
you're going to demand?

00:45:02.949 --> 00:45:04.829
How long are you going to give
them?

00:45:04.829 --> 00:45:08.088
And remember the idea of a new
technology that would change

00:45:08.088 --> 00:45:10.559
vehicle emissions under the
Clean Air Act?

00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:14.132
That requires a four-year
period that the industry has to

00:45:14.132 --> 00:45:16.182
retool,
to think about how they're

00:45:16.182 --> 00:45:19.389
going to redesign their engines
to meet that new standard.

00:45:19.389 --> 00:45:22.650
So restricted use and label
changes and ecological

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:26.710
restrictions are often critical
arguments of environmental and

00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:31.780
consumer use,
consumer protection groups.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.902
And environmental testing,
make certain that the

00:45:34.902 --> 00:45:38.289
environmental testing is
independently conducted.

00:45:38.289 --> 00:45:45.440
Finally are the most exposed,
also the most susceptible?

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.871
Try to figure out how to adjust
the legal regime if you can to

00:45:48.871 --> 00:45:52.530
protect those that are exposed
and those that are most at risk.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:56.143
And can you do that in a way
that would allow continued use

00:45:56.143 --> 00:45:57.389
of the technology?
 

00:45:57.389 --> 00:46:02.255
So can you protect kids from
tobacco in a way that would

00:46:02.255 --> 00:46:07.652
provide sufficient respect for
the value that we assign to the

00:46:07.652 --> 00:46:09.599
freedom to choose?
 

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:12.853
And finally,
oppose federal preemption of

00:46:12.853 --> 00:46:15.050
state and local controls.
 

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:19.871
So environmental groups will
commonly oppose preemption

00:46:19.871 --> 00:46:24.070
because they want 1,000
regulations to bloom.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:26.876
They want California to have
the opportunity to adopt more

00:46:26.876 --> 00:46:30.074
rigorous regulations,
because California's population

00:46:30.074 --> 00:46:33.715
and consumer market share is so
extraordinarily high as a

00:46:33.715 --> 00:46:36.777
percentage of the U.S.,
what happens in California is

00:46:36.777 --> 00:46:38.489
going to happen in the United
States.

00:46:38.489 --> 00:46:40.989
And what happens in the United
States is going to happen

00:46:40.989 --> 00:46:41.400
abroad.
 

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.186
So if you restrict the ability
of a lower level of government

00:46:45.186 --> 00:46:49.324
to adopt these regulations,
then you are not going to have

00:46:49.324 --> 00:46:53.590
the innovation in legal reform
that you otherwise might.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:58.985
So I'll leave you with these
ideas to think about how you

00:46:58.985 --> 00:47:03.715
might conduct these comparisons,
and also how you might take

00:47:03.715 --> 00:47:06.829
some of these strategies to the
problems that you care about.

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:10.068
So I'm going to break here and
I think that we are all set to

00:47:10.068 --> 00:47:12.967
give the exams back,
so if you could perhaps spread

00:47:12.967 --> 00:47:16.280
yourselves out across the front
so not everybody comes to the

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.590
same place,
that would be terrific.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:24.000

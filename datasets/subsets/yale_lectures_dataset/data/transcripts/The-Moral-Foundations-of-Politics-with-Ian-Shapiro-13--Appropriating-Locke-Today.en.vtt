00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.190
Prof: An important
transition today.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.549
We're going to start talking
about the social contract

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.310
tradition.
 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.720
We've come a long way.
 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.427
It's still only February,
but you've really worked

00:00:12.427 --> 00:00:16.286
through two of the major
Enlightenment traditions of

00:00:16.286 --> 00:00:19.010
thinking about political theory.
 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.737
To get into the social contract
tradition we have to go back

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:26.492
again to Locke,
who is a kind of hovering

00:00:26.492 --> 00:00:28.540
presence throughout the whole
course,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.220
and Locke's idea of
workmanship, which we thought

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.820
about mainly in relation to
creation of objects of value,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.414
the theory of property in
Locke, and how that plays itself

00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:46.249
out in the labor theory of value
developed by Marx that we've

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.650
been talking about for some time
over the past couple of weeks.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:59.840
Well, alongside the economics
of workmanship,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.170
if you like,
that goes back to Locke,

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.512
there's a politics of
workmanship, because just as we

00:01:06.512 --> 00:01:10.019
own what we make in the material
sense,

00:01:10.019 --> 00:01:11.933
in Locke's story,
we also own the political

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.299
institutions that we create.
 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:19.239
And if you cast your minds back
to the early lectures I gave on

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:25.084
the Enlightenment project a big
part of that claim was that we

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:30.834
could have maker's knowledge of
the political institutions we

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:36.486
create just as we have maker's
knowledge of the economic and

00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:40.319
social relations that we create.
 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.683
And not only do we have maker's
knowledge so we can have this

00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:46.766
kind of certainty the early
Enlightenment theorists were

00:01:46.766 --> 00:01:50.006
looking for,
but we also have maker's

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.959
authority over what we create.
 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:59.959
Remember I told you that Locke
was engaged in this debate with

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:05.010
other natural law theorists in
the 1660s,

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.710
where the big question was
whether or not God is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.008
omnipotent.
 

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:14.469
And the question was that if
you said God is omnipotent it

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.445
seemed to threaten the
timelessness of natural law

00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:20.300
because he'd be in a position to
change it.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.640
On the other hand,
if you said that God does not

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.551
have the power to change natural
law that seemed to undermine his

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.030
omnipotence.
 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.883
So either the timelessness of
natural law or the omnipotence

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:39.280
of God, but it seemed like you
couldn't have both.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.240
And Locke wrestled with this
question his whole life,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.472
but in the end came down on
what's sometimes called the

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:49.574
voluntarist side,
the will-dependent side,

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:53.220
the side which got him into the
whole workmanship ideal.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.048
So we know what we make and we
own what we make because God

00:02:59.048 --> 00:03:05.379
gave us the capacity to be able
to operate as miniature gods and

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:11.408
to operate in a god-like fashion
creating institutions,

00:03:11.408 --> 00:03:15.296
and economic relationships,
and social relationships over

00:03:15.296 --> 00:03:19.878
which we have the same kind of
control with the caveat that we,

00:03:19.878 --> 00:03:24.615
as God's property,
were bound by God's wishes

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:28.490
which appear to us as natural
law.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.120
Whereas, in the things we
create, so long as we don't

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.395
violate those constraints,
us as God's creatures,

00:03:37.395 --> 00:03:39.800
we can do what we like.
 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.268
And that is the idea that
informs Locke's argument in

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:48.050
The Second Treatise where
he says,

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.206
to remind you,
there's no earthly authority

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:55.643
that can settle disputes about
natural law and so it's every

00:03:55.643 --> 00:04:00.080
person for themself if there
really is a disagreement,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.610
and I'll come back to the
implications of that more fully

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.930
later when we talk about
majority rule.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.659
But the most important point to
take away for right now is that

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.314
we are constrained by natural
law in the natural law tradition

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:22.259
because we're God's property,
and he has maker's knowledge

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.845
over his creation which we are,
but with the constraint or with

00:04:28.845 --> 00:04:35.000
the caveat that he rejects the
traditional idea--

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.093
he was arguing against Filmer
and others about that there's

00:04:37.093 --> 00:04:39.029
anybody,
whether it's the Pope,

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.261
or the King,
or anybody else,

00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:46.033
who has the right to say what
natural law means in the case of

00:04:46.033 --> 00:04:47.050
a dispute.
 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.629
And that's the beginning of
modern individualism for Locke;

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.290
that we're miniature gods on
the one hand,

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.190
and yes, we're constrained by
natural law,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.009
but it's not much of a
constraint, really,

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.701
because we're the ones who get
to say what natural law means in

00:05:05.701 --> 00:05:08.088
a disputed circumstance.
 

00:05:08.088 --> 00:05:14.208
So the individual comes into
the center of thinking about

00:05:14.208 --> 00:05:15.410
politics.
 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.569
Now, Nozick,
Robert Nozick,

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:25.738
is the person we're going to
use to ease our way into modern

00:05:25.738 --> 00:05:29.019
social contract theory.
 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:33.211
In a way it's an odd choice
because Nozick is actually a

00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:36.607
critic of John Rawls,
who we're going to read next,

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:39.903
and probably wouldn't have even
written the book that he wrote

00:05:39.903 --> 00:05:43.470
but for the existence of Rawls's
book to which he was reacting.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.360
But I'm choosing to do Nozick
first for pedagogical reasons.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.562
One is because Nozick
explicitly builds off a Lockean

00:05:52.562 --> 00:05:56.230
set of intuitions,
and secondly because his

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.911
formulation of the social
contract is another variation of

00:06:00.911 --> 00:06:05.755
the rights-utility synthesis
that we looked at in connection

00:06:05.755 --> 00:06:09.372
with Mill,
but it's one that purports to

00:06:09.372 --> 00:06:13.819
solve the main problem that we
were left with in Mill,

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.060
which is the Marxian critique
of markets.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:24.000
If you recall from the end of
our discussion of Marx,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.630
we said that one of the things
that is left untouched by all

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.341
the problems with Marx is Marx's
critique of markets from the

00:06:33.341 --> 00:06:37.543
standpoint of the status quo,
the starting point's problem,

00:06:37.543 --> 00:06:39.449
the garbage-in/garbage-out
problem.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.129
That if you have an unjust
status quo,

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.009
and then a lot of market
transactions,

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.343
all those transactions are
going to be infected by the

00:06:50.343 --> 00:06:53.050
injustice that goes into the
status quo,

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.009
If the corn dealer really is a
starver of the poor,

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:00.459
to use Mill's example in the
chapter on free speech,

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:06.009
Nozick thinks he has an answer
to that.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.663
Nozick thinks that he has a
reformulation of the

00:07:10.663 --> 00:07:16.009
rights-utility synthesis that
answers that problem,

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:20.673
and we'll only get to how he
thinks he answers that problem

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:23.817
next Monday,
but he thinks that he has an

00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:26.461
answer,
and in fact it's a brilliant

00:07:26.461 --> 00:07:27.040
answer.
 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.555
And even those of you who don't
like that answer are going to

00:07:31.555 --> 00:07:35.620
find it very difficult to
respond to Nozick's point.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:41.867
But before getting into the
details of Nozick's argument I

00:07:41.867 --> 00:07:47.898
think it's worth just pausing
for a minute to notice two

00:07:47.898 --> 00:07:53.379
problems that any social
contract theory has,

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:58.312
and has long been known to
have, which anybody who tries to

00:07:58.312 --> 00:08:03.160
come up with a social contract
theory has to deal with.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.199
It's long been known,
first of all,

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:11.889
that because there never was an
actual social contract,

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:17.310
that assumptions you make about
natural man tend to be loaded

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.730
with assumptions about human
beings from your own society.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.225
This critique is maybe not as
old as the hills,

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:30.860
but it's certainly as old as
Rousseau's critique of Hobbes.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.629
Writing in the eighteenth
century, Rousseau said,

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:38.029
the problem with Hobbes'
Leviathan,

00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:41.534
which is another version of the
social contract that we're not

00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:44.498
reading in this course--
Rousseau said the problem with

00:08:44.498 --> 00:08:47.287
Leviathan is that Hobbes
takes assumptions from the

00:08:47.287 --> 00:08:50.375
people of his own day,
and attributes them to natural

00:08:50.375 --> 00:08:53.378
man,
projects them on to the idea of

00:08:53.378 --> 00:08:55.779
natural man,
and you can't do that.

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:59.847
And so Rousseau's own version
of the social contract is much

00:08:59.847 --> 00:09:01.090
more historical.
 

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:07.274
It attempts to take account of
the evolution of people from

00:09:07.274 --> 00:09:13.245
some kind of almost pre-human
condition to a condition in

00:09:13.245 --> 00:09:18.788
which social and political
relationships evolve.

00:09:18.788 --> 00:09:25.638
But this claim is made time and
again when people talk about the

00:09:25.638 --> 00:09:32.269
social contract as moving from a
condition of pre-natural,

00:09:32.269 --> 00:09:36.980
pre-political man to a social
and political condition people

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.619
say,
"Well, the problem with it

00:09:39.619 --> 00:09:42.370
is Rousseau's problem with
Hobbes."

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:47.759
That what people in fact do is
take a set of assumptions about

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:52.532
human beings that are the
product of the society that's

00:09:52.532 --> 00:09:57.038
been created and attribute them
to natural man.

00:09:57.038 --> 00:10:00.881
And so you get this problem
that what you put into it

00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:05.462
is--it's a different but related
kind of garbage-in/garbage-out

00:10:05.462 --> 00:10:06.350
problem.
 

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:13.410
The assumptions you make about
human nature are taken from the

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:21.298
society you want to justify,
and then you present them as

00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:27.750
though they were features of
pre-social,

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.320
if you like, human nature.
 

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.379
And so the argument goes.
 

00:10:32.379 --> 00:10:36.849
What we now know from 200 years
of anthropology is that actually

00:10:36.849 --> 00:10:38.408
Aristotle was right.
 

00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:44.048
There never was a pre-social
condition.

00:10:44.048 --> 00:10:47.186
Human beings are naturally
social creatures and you can't

00:10:47.186 --> 00:10:50.769
analyze them apart from their
social and cultural environment.

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:52.090
You just can't do it.
 

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:59.008
Anything you try to do in that
general direction will be--it

00:10:59.008 --> 00:11:03.230
will obscure more than it
reveals.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.830
You'll end up with tendentious
assumptions about human nature

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.658
that will allow you to derive
the conclusions that you want,

00:11:12.658 --> 00:11:16.038
but at the end of the day this
is only going to persuade the

00:11:16.038 --> 00:11:19.187
people who agreed with you
before you began and it's not

00:11:19.187 --> 00:11:23.350
going to convince the skeptics,
so what's the point?

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:29.169
So this is one problem that has
long been known to attend social

00:11:29.169 --> 00:11:33.513
contract theory,
and anybody who's going to roll

00:11:33.513 --> 00:11:36.470
one out has to deal with it.
 

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.702
And what you find with the
modern social contract theorists

00:11:41.702 --> 00:11:45.038
like Nozick and Rawls is they
say,

00:11:45.038 --> 00:11:48.211
"Granted,
we don't disagree that there

00:11:48.211 --> 00:11:50.928
never was a social
contract."

00:11:50.928 --> 00:11:53.759
And indeed, even if you look at
the--

00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:58.082
those of you who are students
of American history will know

00:11:58.082 --> 00:12:02.556
even if you look at the social
contract that came the closest

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:07.028
to being an actual social
contract to create a society,

00:12:07.028 --> 00:12:08.960
namely the creation of the
American Republic,

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.947
even there if you look it
didn't come about as the result

00:12:13.947 --> 00:12:15.548
of an agreement.
 

00:12:15.548 --> 00:12:21.311
The Federal Constitution was
put in place in violation of the

00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:24.000
Articles of Confederation.
 

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.984
It was largely imposed by the
Federalist forces who were

00:12:27.984 --> 00:12:30.447
stronger than the
anti-Federalists,

00:12:30.447 --> 00:12:32.908
than the Confederation forces.
 

00:12:32.908 --> 00:12:38.970
So even the American example,
which is the one that inspires

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.490
Nozick's book,
is not a case of a creation of

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.009
a society from whole cloth by
agreement;

00:12:48.009 --> 00:12:49.972
it's neither out of whole cloth
because there were already

00:12:49.972 --> 00:12:51.490
social and political
arrangements before,

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:56.405
and it's not really by
agreement because it was imposed

00:12:56.405 --> 00:13:01.048
on those who didn't want it
pretty much by force.

00:13:01.048 --> 00:13:04.924
We'll come back to the extent
to which it was imposed later,

00:13:04.924 --> 00:13:06.830
but the basic fact remains.
 

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.610
Nozick knows all of that.
 

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.710
He's not a fool,
and he's not ignorant,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.613
but he says,
"Let's suppose society

00:13:16.613 --> 00:13:22.019
could be created by unanimous
agreement,

00:13:22.019 --> 00:13:26.700
could be created by consent,
what would it look like?"

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.405
And we're not saying
pre-political,

00:13:29.405 --> 00:13:32.908
pre-social beings,
people like you and me.

00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:40.154
If we were in a situation where
there was no state what kind of

00:13:40.154 --> 00:13:44.009
state, if any,
would we create?

00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:47.474
And we'll see when we come to
do John Rawls,

00:13:47.474 --> 00:13:51.019
after the break,
he has the same approach.

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:57.038
People often get Rawls and
Nozick wrong.

00:13:57.038 --> 00:14:00.034
They're not saying,
"We can imagine what

00:14:00.034 --> 00:14:04.187
people would be like if a state
didn't exist in the sense that

00:14:04.187 --> 00:14:08.519
Hobbes did and Locke did,
and Rousseau criticized them

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:09.908
for doing."
 

00:14:09.908 --> 00:14:16.009
Rather he's saying,
"You and me,

00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:18.630
considering ourselves as we
are, if the state didn't exist

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.610
what kind of state would we
create?"

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.970
We know it's a thought
experiment.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.649
We know it's a hypothetical
exercise;

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:29.370
nonetheless,
if we can answer that question,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.770
it gives us a standard by which
we can compare existing

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:38.254
institutions that didn't come
about in that way from the

00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:42.330
standpoint of this normative
ideal of consent.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.039
What would people have chosen,
even though they never did

00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:48.269
choose it,
tells us something about

00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:53.442
existing institutions,
namely those that are closer to

00:14:53.442 --> 00:14:57.009
what people would have chosen
are better,

00:14:57.009 --> 00:15:00.342
and those that are further from
what people would have chosen

00:15:00.342 --> 00:15:01.009
are worse.
 

00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:03.927
So it's the search for a
normative ideal based on a

00:15:03.927 --> 00:15:05.330
hypothetical contract.
 

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:09.210
Whereas, Hobbes and Locke
thought the state of nature was

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:13.091
a condition that had actually
existed in the world and to

00:15:13.091 --> 00:15:15.168
which people could return.
 

00:15:15.168 --> 00:15:18.796
Hobbes thought England,
during the Civil War,

00:15:18.796 --> 00:15:22.009
actually went into a state of
nature.

00:15:22.009 --> 00:15:25.148
Locke thought much of North
America, in the seventeenth

00:15:25.148 --> 00:15:27.240
century, was in a state of
nature.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.480
So it's a very different
exercise in that sense.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:33.019
It's a hypothetical social
contract,

00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:35.878
not an actual one,
designed to generate a

00:15:35.878 --> 00:15:39.446
normative standard,
a standard for evaluating

00:15:39.446 --> 00:15:43.120
institutions as they exist in
the real world.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.210
That's all.
 

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.580
So that's the first thing.
 

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.572
You have to have an answer to
this there-never-was-

00:15:49.572 --> 00:15:53.419
a-social-contract critique,
and the answer of the modern

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:57.559
social contract theorists is,
"Yes, we know,

00:15:57.559 --> 00:16:02.778
but it's still a useful
hypothetical exercise."

00:16:02.778 --> 00:16:08.371
The other problem that anyone
rolling out a social contract

00:16:08.371 --> 00:16:14.061
theory has to address is that
nobody really buys natural law

00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:20.038
arguments in the way that was
often hoped that they would.

00:16:20.038 --> 00:16:24.653
Now, it's important to get
clear about this because what we

00:16:24.653 --> 00:16:29.028
don't want to do is to buy into
a rather simplistic,

00:16:29.028 --> 00:16:33.955
comic strip version of the
history of ideas that sometimes

00:16:33.955 --> 00:16:36.029
shows up in textbooks.
 

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:39.457
The comic strip version goes
something like this:

00:16:39.457 --> 00:16:42.429
well,
there used to be natural law

00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:47.061
theory and that solved the
problem of how we get higher

00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:50.918
values for judging existing
institutions,

00:16:50.918 --> 00:16:55.899
but then along came the decline
of natural law and secularism,

00:16:55.899 --> 00:17:01.996
and we lost belief in natural
law, and so now everything is a

00:17:01.996 --> 00:17:04.028
sea of relativism.
 

00:17:04.028 --> 00:17:07.710
Once you start down that path
you wind up with Stevenson.

00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:10.252
You wind up,
remember, emotivism and all

00:17:10.252 --> 00:17:10.710
that?
 

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.028
We talked about it in relation
to Mill.

00:17:14.028 --> 00:17:17.555
Once you start down the path of
rejecting natural law you're

00:17:17.555 --> 00:17:21.140
going to wind up with extreme
relativism and subjectivism.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.171
You're going to wind up with
the idea that everybody's moral

00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:30.180
judgment is just as good as
everybody else's.

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.895
And the problem with natural
law theory is it's a throwback

00:17:33.895 --> 00:17:37.098
to this era when people believed
in natural law.

00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:43.548
And so now people don't,
and that's the problem.

00:17:43.548 --> 00:17:47.711
And so how can you generate a
natural law theory when most

00:17:47.711 --> 00:17:51.069
people don't accept the idea of
natural law?

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:55.029
That's the cartoon strip story.
 

00:17:55.029 --> 00:18:00.009
And the cartoon strip story has
one very big problem with it,

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:03.156
which you are in a position to
know about because of what we've

00:18:03.156 --> 00:18:04.630
read with respect to Locke.
 

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:10.119
Namely, that there never was
agreement on what natural law

00:18:10.119 --> 00:18:11.180
required.
 

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.423
I talked to you about the
disagreement between those who

00:18:15.423 --> 00:18:19.974
favored the timeless universal
conception of natural law and

00:18:19.974 --> 00:18:24.373
those who favored the so-called
voluntarist or workmanship

00:18:24.373 --> 00:18:26.920
theory that Locke embraced.
 

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.940
But actually that's only the
tip of the iceberg.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.596
You go and read a book like
Richard Tuck's book on medieval

00:18:34.596 --> 00:18:39.174
natural law theory and what
you'll discover is that in the

00:18:39.174 --> 00:18:42.007
fifteenth,
sixteenth, seventeenth

00:18:42.007 --> 00:18:46.666
centuries the disagreements that
they had within the natural law

00:18:46.666 --> 00:18:50.586
tradition about politics were
just as extensive as the

00:18:50.586 --> 00:18:53.250
disagreements we have to today.
 

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:58.436
That is to say you could find
people defending everything from

00:18:58.436 --> 00:19:02.009
what we think of today as the
far left,

00:19:02.009 --> 00:19:06.825
to everything that we think of
today as the far right within

00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:10.088
the idiom of a natural law
vocabulary.

00:19:10.088 --> 00:19:13.019
But there wasn't less
disagreement.

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:15.298
There wasn't less political
disagreement.

00:19:15.298 --> 00:19:19.082
There were huge political
disagreements that led to

00:19:19.082 --> 00:19:22.712
enormous--to civil wars,
to religious wars in the

00:19:22.712 --> 00:19:25.740
sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:32.296
So the notion that appealing to
natural law is some sort of

00:19:32.296 --> 00:19:34.954
panacea,
and that the problem is that

00:19:34.954 --> 00:19:38.240
the world we've lost is a world
in which there was natural law,

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:43.190
doesn't get us anywhere because
we know that natural law,

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:49.009
whatever its virtues and
deficiencies,

00:19:49.009 --> 00:19:52.230
is not something that can solve
political disagreements.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.780
As I said, there was a natural
law theory that was compatible

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:00.650
with every political position
you could imagine,

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:04.750
and many that you couldn't
imagine which existed.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:09.784
If you want examples of that go
and read Christopher Hill's book

00:20:09.784 --> 00:20:13.460
called The World Turned
Upside Down,

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.051
which is a book about ideas and
political movements that got

00:20:18.051 --> 00:20:21.009
nowhere in the seventeenth
century,

00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:26.211
and you'll see that natural law
could be lined up with any

00:20:26.211 --> 00:20:29.680
politics you could possibly
imagine.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:35.346
We don't want to say that the
problem is that natural law used

00:20:35.346 --> 00:20:40.549
to constrain and now it doesn't
because people agreed;

00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:42.150
we know that they didn't.
 

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:45.056
Nonetheless,
that still leaves the

00:20:45.056 --> 00:20:50.604
analytical problem that if there
are going to be any constraints

00:20:50.604 --> 00:20:54.480
on what it is that people can
agree to,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:21:01.490
that are not simply the result
of what we have found in the

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.670
world,
they must come from somewhere.

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:10.622
And if you're going to roll out
a natural law theory that

00:21:10.622 --> 00:21:16.016
doesn't depend upon natural law,
you've got to find some other

00:21:16.016 --> 00:21:18.670
basis for doing it,
right?

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:23.548
I mean, just to give you one
more example to underscore this,

00:21:23.548 --> 00:21:31.380
we saw that the inequalities
among people--

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.410
we talked about this some and
we're going to talk about it

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:36.430
more in connection with John
Rawls--

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.983
they're a big problem for us
because why should some people

00:21:40.983 --> 00:21:45.382
get more than others just
because they're smarter or more

00:21:45.382 --> 00:21:48.210
hard-working than others,
right?

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:53.136
If you're a Lockean there's no
problem with that proposition

00:21:53.136 --> 00:21:57.896
because if some people are more
able to create wealth than

00:21:57.896 --> 00:22:02.490
others it must have been part of
God's plan, right?

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.798
But once you secularize
workmanship and chop off the

00:22:06.798 --> 00:22:10.009
idea of natural law and God's
plan,

00:22:10.009 --> 00:22:11.902
and all that,
then you get into the sorts of

00:22:11.902 --> 00:22:14.499
problems we got into when we
were dealing with Marx's theory

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:15.380
of exploitation.
 

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.038
Remember when we introduced the
stay-at-home spouse,

00:22:19.038 --> 00:22:24.930
and the contributions of Sunday
school teachers or anybody else

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:30.440
to the creation of value we got
this over determined set of

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.808
entitlements that didn't lead us
anywhere.

00:22:34.808 --> 00:22:42.921
So once you secularize
workmanship it seems to lead

00:22:42.921 --> 00:22:45.029
everywhere.
 

00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:47.583
If you no longer have the
constraint that Locke had,

00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:50.587
well what we see where must be
God's plan because this is how

00:22:50.587 --> 00:22:52.798
he created it;
so what are you going to use

00:22:52.798 --> 00:22:53.220
instead?
 

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.490
That's the question.
 

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.598
What are you going to use
instead of natural law?

00:22:58.598 --> 00:23:05.738
And the modern social contract
theorists appeal to a nineteenth

00:23:05.738 --> 00:23:11.608
century German philosopher
called Immanuel Kant,

00:23:11.608 --> 00:23:20.464
eighteenth and nineteenth
century thinker who came up with

00:23:20.464 --> 00:23:26.990
an idea that stands in for
natural law,

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:32.868
and that is the idea of--wait
for it;

00:23:32.868 --> 00:23:38.112
I told you people don't like to
say in words of one syllable

00:23:38.112 --> 00:23:41.400
what can be said in words of
five--

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.410
universalizability,
universalizability,

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.150
nine-syllable word.
 

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:51.333
And the basic intuition here is
the following:

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:56.306
the basic intuition is,
if you could choose something

00:23:56.306 --> 00:23:59.480
from every conceivable
standpoint,

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:05.548
then it has the force of a
moral law.

00:24:05.548 --> 00:24:10.325
Anyone know what the
philosophical term for this was

00:24:10.325 --> 00:24:15.099
that Kant came up with,
anyone who took a philosophy

00:24:15.099 --> 00:24:16.130
course?
 

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.413
Student: Categorical
imperative.

00:24:19.413 --> 00:24:24.500
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Categorical imperative.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:31.019
Well, what was the categorical
imperative contrasted with?

00:24:31.019 --> 00:24:38.240
Somebody? Anyone know?
 

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.200
No reason that you should.
 

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.316
The categorical imperative was
contrasted with the hypothetical

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:45.180
imperative.
 

00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:49.000
And the idea of a hypothetical
imperative was if/then.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.854
So if you want your society to
thrive don't create big

00:24:52.854 --> 00:24:53.798
government.
 

00:24:53.798 --> 00:24:55.868
That's a hypothetical
imperative.

00:24:55.868 --> 00:24:59.962
Categorical imperative is,
don't create big government

00:24:59.962 --> 00:25:02.278
ever under any circumstance.
 

00:25:02.278 --> 00:25:10.270
So the idea of a categorical
imperative is that it's not

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:16.519
dependent on an if/then
statement, right?

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:25.009
So that's the notion behind
Kant's ethics;

00:25:25.009 --> 00:25:27.410
that we should look for
propositions that we would

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.368
affirm regardless of the
consequences.

00:25:29.368 --> 00:25:32.509
That's the notion of a
categorical imperative.

00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:35.378
Now Rawls goes into this in
some detail of what its

00:25:35.378 --> 00:25:38.249
implications are for
contemporary political theory,

00:25:38.249 --> 00:25:40.890
and we'll talk about that after
the break.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.328
Nozick just takes it for
granted, and one of the reasons

00:25:44.328 --> 00:25:47.955
I'm starting with Nozick is I
don't really want to dig into

00:25:47.955 --> 00:25:51.833
the question yet of whether and
to what extent Kant's ideas are

00:25:51.833 --> 00:25:54.460
applicable to contemporary
politics.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:58.352
Nozick says,
"Let's just try them out

00:25:58.352 --> 00:26:01.009
and see,"
basically,

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:03.440
so one of his slogans is,
"Kantianism for people,

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.990
utilitarianism for
animals,"

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.630
right?
 

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:10.734
And the notion here is for
human beings this idea of

00:26:10.734 --> 00:26:15.644
respecting principles that can
be affirmed from every point of

00:26:15.644 --> 00:26:19.144
view,
that's going to replace natural

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:19.578
law.
 

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:25.494
That's the move that Nozick
makes, and it's the move that

00:26:25.494 --> 00:26:27.818
Rawls makes as well.
 

00:26:27.818 --> 00:26:32.634
Does anyone happen to know what
the famous categorical

00:26:32.634 --> 00:26:37.009
imperative was,
the example that Kant gave of

00:26:37.009 --> 00:26:41.736
something that rises to this
level of a categorical

00:26:41.736 --> 00:26:43.058
imperative?
 

00:26:43.058 --> 00:26:45.269
It isn't just merely
hypothetical.

00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:48.990
 
 

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.701
Well, the example he gave was,
"Always treat others as

00:26:52.701 --> 00:26:55.900
ends in themselves,
not merely as means to your own

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.858
ends."
 

00:26:56.858 --> 00:27:03.295
The bumper sticker for this is
autonomy, "Respect people's

00:27:03.295 --> 00:27:05.058
autonomy."
 

00:27:05.058 --> 00:27:09.496
This is our rights piece of the
rights-utility synthesis,

00:27:09.496 --> 00:27:10.130
right?
 

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:15.467
And Kant's view was that is a
proposition everybody would

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:19.946
affirm regardless of the
empirical consequences,

00:27:19.946 --> 00:27:23.568
regardless of what effects it
has.

00:27:23.568 --> 00:27:26.971
You'll always say that,
no matter who you are,

00:27:26.971 --> 00:27:31.356
that we should respect the
autonomy of others understood in

00:27:31.356 --> 00:27:32.338
this way.
 

00:27:32.338 --> 00:27:38.019
Yes, we all have to use one
another to some extent.

00:27:38.019 --> 00:27:40.624
He doesn't say,
"Never use people as means

00:27:40.624 --> 00:27:43.143
to your own ends";
he says, "Never use people

00:27:43.143 --> 00:27:44.710
exclusively as means to your own
end."

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.856
So that's his example,
and that's what Nozick takes

00:27:48.856 --> 00:27:53.586
over in his conception of
individual liberty which he puts

00:27:53.586 --> 00:27:57.900
out there right at the beginning
of Anarchy,

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.970
State, and Utopia,
when he says,

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.969
"There is no social entity
with a good that undergoes some

00:28:03.969 --> 00:28:05.838
sacrifice for its own good.
 

00:28:05.838 --> 00:28:09.728
There are only individual
people, different individual

00:28:09.728 --> 00:28:12.808
people, with their own
individual lives.

00:28:12.808 --> 00:28:16.023
Using one of these people for
the benefit of others,

00:28:16.023 --> 00:28:18.230
uses him and benefits the
others.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.798
Nothing more."
 

00:28:20.798 --> 00:28:25.797
So there's a strong libertarian
stance identified with this

00:28:25.797 --> 00:28:30.450
Kantian notion of respecting the
autonomy of others.

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:34.825
We can't use people for some
greater good because then we're

00:28:34.825 --> 00:28:35.788
using them.
 

00:28:35.788 --> 00:28:42.191
We're violating their rights,
and this is where Nozick is

00:28:42.191 --> 00:28:43.220
headed.
 

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:47.019
And what he does is disarmingly
simple,

00:28:47.019 --> 00:28:52.097
and easily dismissed,
and you make a mistake if you

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:58.090
dismiss him because you'll not
see what turns on some of his

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:04.490
claims that turns out to be very
interesting and important.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:10.623
So what he does is,
he says, "Let's imagine

00:29:10.623 --> 00:29:14.798
there was no government."
 

00:29:14.798 --> 00:29:16.430
We're not talking about
primitive people.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:17.880
We're talking about people like
you and me.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:22.450
Let's imagine there was no
government.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.250
What would happen?
 

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:29.529
What would people do if there
was no government?

00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:34.130
 
 

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:41.164
And Nozick is aware that you
could make different assumptions

00:29:41.164 --> 00:29:42.690
about that.
 

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.084
Like Hobbes makes the
assumption in Leviathan

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:50.210
that people will be so afraid of
one another that they will try

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.539
and kill everybody around them.
 

00:29:52.539 --> 00:29:56.009
Then you'll get civil war.
 

00:29:56.009 --> 00:30:00.090
The fear that others are going
to do something to you will be

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.376
so great that unless you impose
an authoritarian state on people

00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:07.028
they're going to have a civil
war,

00:30:07.028 --> 00:30:09.680
and there's no other
possibility.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.730
And so by making the state of
nature very benevolent Locke

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.009
thinks he's going a different
way,

00:30:18.009 --> 00:30:21.535
because by making it malign
it's easy for Hobbes to justify

00:30:21.535 --> 00:30:24.717
authoritarianism;
the state of nature is so

00:30:24.717 --> 00:30:29.421
terrible that anyone would put
with an authoritarian system

00:30:29.421 --> 00:30:34.450
rather than the civil war in
which life is "solitary,

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:36.580
poor, nasty,
brutish and short,"

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.890
as Hobbes put it in
Leviathan.

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.029
So Nozick says,
"Let's not do that.

00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:44.534
Let's go with Locke,
and let's make the state of

00:30:44.534 --> 00:30:47.730
nature relatively benign because
it'll make our argument more

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:48.848
convincing."
 

00:30:48.848 --> 00:30:54.526
It'll make our argument more
convincing because if you make

00:30:54.526 --> 00:31:00.298
the state of nature relatively
benign it's harder to justify

00:31:00.298 --> 00:31:03.038
the creation of a state.
 

00:31:03.038 --> 00:31:06.362
And we want to make it hard for
ourselves to justify the

00:31:06.362 --> 00:31:09.986
creation of a state because then
it'll make our argument more

00:31:09.986 --> 00:31:12.038
convincing to skeptics,
right?

00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:14.796
So we want to make this
intellectual problem as hard for

00:31:14.796 --> 00:31:16.348
ourselves as we possibly can.
 

00:31:16.348 --> 00:31:20.130
Now there's something of an
intellectual slight-of-hand

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.420
going on in this that I'm going
to come back to,

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.009
but I'll just flag for right
now.

00:31:26.009 --> 00:31:29.616
And the way he sets it up,
he says, "Let's make it

00:31:29.616 --> 00:31:32.490
hard to derive the idea of a
state."

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.810
So he says, "Imagine a
world in which there's no

00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.390
government."
 

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:45.380
It's a hard thing for us to do.
 

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:52.083
Just to make this real;
do you know when police were

00:31:52.083 --> 00:31:52.670
created?
 

00:31:52.670 --> 00:32:00.420
The first police force was
created in Britain before here.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.303
No reason you should,
1830 Prime Minister Peel

00:32:04.303 --> 00:32:08.531
created the--the first police
were called Peelers,

00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:11.380
named for the Prime Minister.
 

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.778
But imagine,
just you think about it.

00:32:13.778 --> 00:32:17.068
Think about living in a world
where there were no police.

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:22.113
I mean, it'd be a very,
very different world,

00:32:22.113 --> 00:32:23.028
right?
 

00:32:23.028 --> 00:32:28.240
Think about the ways in which
just in a day in New Haven,

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:33.339
the number of things that go on
that are somehow affected by the

00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:35.769
hovering presence of police.
 

00:32:35.769 --> 00:32:39.808
And so Nozick wants you to do
that in a more radical way.

00:32:39.808 --> 00:32:43.358
What would happen if there was
no government?

00:32:43.358 --> 00:32:57.650
Well, it wouldn't be a very
efficient circumstance.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.009
 
 

00:33:01.009 --> 00:33:05.278
Even if we don't think that
everyone would be out chopping

00:33:05.278 --> 00:33:09.546
one another to pieces with
machetes it still wouldn't be a

00:33:09.546 --> 00:33:14.262
very efficient situation because
everybody would be the enforcer

00:33:14.262 --> 00:33:16.660
of natural law themselves.
 

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:19.298
This is the Lockean story,
as you know.

00:33:19.298 --> 00:33:28.746
So if I were in here lecturing
to you, I'd have to worry maybe

00:33:28.746 --> 00:33:36.798
somebody's grabbing my car and
making off with it.

00:33:36.798 --> 00:33:42.891
So I would have to find some
way to protect my car while I

00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:47.190
was in here doing this,
and maybe I could do it,

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.990
but it's going to be a very
inefficient thing for me to do.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:54.900
And so how am I going to do
that?

00:33:54.900 --> 00:34:01.460
How is life going to go on if
people can't even know that

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:06.380
their property is going to be
protected?

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:11.079
Well, they're going to form
protective associations.

00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:16.293
I'm going to say to some
colleague, "I'll tell you

00:34:16.293 --> 00:34:16.969
what.
 

00:34:16.969 --> 00:34:21.472
You watch my car on Mondays and
Wednesdays while I'm lecturing

00:34:21.472 --> 00:34:25.827
and I'll watch your car,"
a sort of block watch kind of

00:34:25.827 --> 00:34:27.010
idea, right?
 

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.844
People are going to form
associations to protect

00:34:29.844 --> 00:34:33.585
themselves and to protect their
property because in the absence

00:34:33.585 --> 00:34:37.536
of that,
it's a very inefficient,

00:34:37.536 --> 00:34:41.099
highly inefficient system.
 

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:52.684
So you would imagine there
would basically be like block

00:34:52.684 --> 00:34:56.313
watch,
but even that would be not

00:34:56.313 --> 00:34:59.380
particularly efficient because
the truth is,

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:03.043
not only do I not want to watch
my car on Mondays and

00:35:03.043 --> 00:35:05.608
Wednesdays,
I don't really want to watch

00:35:05.608 --> 00:35:08.541
somebody else's car on Tuesdays
and Thursdays either,

00:35:08.541 --> 00:35:09.050
right?
 

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:14.900
So what would happen is we
would start to have a division

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.050
of labor.
 

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:20.922
We would start to have a
situation in which we paid

00:35:20.922 --> 00:35:26.090
somebody to watch cars,
and they would be sort of like

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.039
little militias.
 

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:37.789
They would be businesses that
sold protection.

00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:43.529
And so you could imagine a
group of us joining one

00:35:43.529 --> 00:35:48.800
association that promises to
protect cars,

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.447
but others would join a
different association that

00:35:53.447 --> 00:35:56.010
promised to protect cars.
 

00:35:56.010 --> 00:36:01.445
So we'd have the New Haven
business that sells car

00:36:01.445 --> 00:36:03.728
protection,
but we'd have the Hamden one,

00:36:03.728 --> 00:36:07.099
and we'd have the Orange one,
and there would be these

00:36:07.099 --> 00:36:13.469
different businesses selling
protection for people's cars.

00:36:13.469 --> 00:36:18.121
But, and this is one of
Nozick's most important

00:36:18.121 --> 00:36:23.179
analytical claims with
application to politics,

00:36:23.179 --> 00:36:27.139
he says, "The thing about
coercive force--

00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:32.960
protection--is that it's a
natural monopoly."

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:37.500
 
 

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.949
What do you think he might mean
by that, anyone?

00:36:42.949 --> 00:36:46.603
It's bringing an economist
category to think about a

00:36:46.603 --> 00:36:50.114
non-economic topic,
but what do you think he might

00:36:50.114 --> 00:36:50.760
mean?
 

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.519
Anyone want to try this?
 

00:36:54.519 --> 00:36:56.059
It might seem puzzling.
 

00:36:56.059 --> 00:37:01.929
 
 

00:37:01.929 --> 00:37:06.043
Think about a country in which
there are many militias like

00:37:06.043 --> 00:37:10.442
Lebanon in the 1980s or Russia
after the collapse of the Soviet

00:37:10.442 --> 00:37:14.768
Union where you've got these
organized crime syndicates,

00:37:14.768 --> 00:37:17.550
more or less,
or Chicago, for that matter,

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.280
during the heyday of organized
crime.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:24.710
What happens when you have
multiple entities selling

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:25.840
protection?
 

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:31.730
 
 

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:40.219
Yeah, take the microphone.
 

00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:41.550
Student: They start fighting
with each other.

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:44.059
Professor Ian Shapiro:
They start fighting with each

00:37:44.059 --> 00:37:44.699
other, why?
 

00:37:44.699 --> 00:37:46.677
You're dead right,
but why do they fight with each

00:37:46.677 --> 00:37:47.000
other?
 

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.650
Student: It's like fighting
over territory in a way.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.989
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Territory, what else?

00:37:50.989 --> 00:37:53.405
Student: If one member gets in
a fight with a member from a

00:37:53.405 --> 00:37:55.864
different group they have to
protect that member and so does

00:37:55.864 --> 00:37:58.224
the other group,
so they have no other choice

00:37:58.224 --> 00:37:59.550
but to fight each other.
 

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:00.980
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Exactly right.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.931
I mean, you just go and watch a
movie like the Godfather,

00:38:04.931 --> 00:38:07.896
or Goodfellas,
or any of those and you know

00:38:07.896 --> 00:38:09.590
what the dynamic is.
 

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:12.130
I say to you,
"You pay me protection

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:15.367
money and I'll make sure you're
taken care of,"

00:38:15.367 --> 00:38:19.559
but then some bigger thug comes
around the next day and says,

00:38:19.559 --> 00:38:23.050
"You might think Shapiro
can protect you,

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:27.273
but what do you think that wimp
on the Yale faculty can do for

00:38:27.273 --> 00:38:27.690
you?
 

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:29.400
Forget about it.
 

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.880
You're going to pay me,
and what's more you're going to

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.030
pay me much more."
 

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:36.469
And so that's going to go on,
and how will it end?

00:38:36.469 --> 00:38:38.762
Generally what happens?
 

00:38:38.762 --> 00:38:39.260
Yeah?
 

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.849
Student:
&gt;

00:38:42.849 --> 00:38:45.181
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Exactly.

00:38:45.181 --> 00:38:49.610
In civil wars somebody wins,
usually, or else they drag on

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:52.719
but eventually somebody wins,
right?

00:38:52.719 --> 00:38:56.250
That's the claim about a
natural monopoly force.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:03.382
For coercive force to be a
good, it has to be exercised as

00:39:03.382 --> 00:39:05.010
a monopoly.
 

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:09.826
For coercive force to be a
good, it has to be exercised as

00:39:09.826 --> 00:39:12.391
a monopoly,
and that's one claim Nozick

00:39:12.391 --> 00:39:15.300
wants to make,
and the other one,

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:21.233
which is just as important is,
"It is the only natural

00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:22.500
monopoly."
 

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.840
Coercive force is a natural
monopoly,

00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:29.498
where we unpack that to say,
"In order for it be a

00:39:29.498 --> 00:39:32.106
good,
it has to be exercised as a

00:39:32.106 --> 00:39:37.505
monopoly,
and there's no other natural

00:39:37.505 --> 00:39:40.110
monopoly."
 

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:45.940
 
 

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:50.840
This morning when I was coming
in, Glenn Beck was complaining.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.710
How many of you know who Glenn
Beck is?

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.179
Yeah.
 

00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:58.960
Who's Glenn Beck?
 

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.659
Somebody want to tell us,
who's Glenn Beck?

00:40:01.659 --> 00:40:06.449
 
 

00:40:06.449 --> 00:40:09.969
Anybody? Yeah?
 

00:40:09.969 --> 00:40:12.751
Student: He's a conservative
talk show host and just a social

00:40:12.751 --> 00:40:13.909
commentator in general.
 

00:40:13.909 --> 00:40:17.398
Professor Ian Shapiro:
He's a conservative talk show

00:40:17.398 --> 00:40:21.092
host and social commentator who
sees himself as kind of

00:40:21.092 --> 00:40:24.989
disciplining the Republican
Party to keep it close to what

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:28.751
he sees as conservative
principles that are defined in a

00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:31.010
strongly libertarian way.
 

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.199
And so what was his complaint
this morning?

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:40.733
His complaint was that Mike
Huckabee had Michelle Obama on

00:40:40.733 --> 00:40:44.518
his show,
or did some event with Michelle

00:40:44.518 --> 00:40:47.367
Obama,
agreeing with Michelle Obama

00:40:47.367 --> 00:40:50.710
that obesity is a big problem in
America.

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:55.293
And he said,
"How dare Mike Huckabee do

00:40:55.293 --> 00:40:56.039
that?
 

00:40:56.039 --> 00:40:59.126
Of course obesity is a big
problem in America,

00:40:59.126 --> 00:41:03.311
but that doesn't mean it's an
invitation for the government to

00:41:03.311 --> 00:41:05.849
get involved in stopping
obesity.

00:41:05.849 --> 00:41:08.768
The government should only do
one thing;

00:41:08.768 --> 00:41:13.309
protect us from the bad
guys."

00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:17.898
In that sense he was--he's
probably never heard of Nozick

00:41:17.898 --> 00:41:23.925
and all of Nozick's argument,
but he was embracing this idea

00:41:23.925 --> 00:41:29.599
that coercive force is the only
natural monopoly.

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:37.398
So Nozick wants to say,
if we go back into our thought

00:41:37.398 --> 00:41:40.773
experiment,
he wants to say,

00:41:40.773 --> 00:41:45.695
"Because coercive force is
a natural monopoly somebody's

00:41:45.695 --> 00:41:47.010
going to win.
 

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:51.668
They're going to either buy up
the other protective

00:41:51.668 --> 00:41:55.920
associations,
or defeat them,

00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:02.730
wipe them out,
or marginalize them,

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:07.849
make them irrelevant by being
so much more powerful that

00:42:07.849 --> 00:42:10.829
nobody pays attention to them.
 

00:42:10.829 --> 00:42:16.253
So in effect you're then going
to have one dominant protective

00:42:16.253 --> 00:42:18.119
association, right?
 

00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:28.760
 
 

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:34.815
Once you have one dominant
protective association it's

00:42:34.815 --> 00:42:39.730
something pretty much like a
government,

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.059
 
 

00:42:43.059 --> 00:42:48.474
but still there are going to be
some people who don't recognize

00:42:48.474 --> 00:42:50.925
it,
and these are the people that

00:42:50.925 --> 00:42:52.719
Nozick calls independents.
 

00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:59.070
 
 

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.545
And Nozick spends a lot of time
discussing these people,

00:43:02.545 --> 00:43:05.010
and you might think,
"Why?"

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:09.487
There's this very long and
difficult to understand chapter

00:43:09.487 --> 00:43:13.809
on the incorporation of
independents into his system.

00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:17.943
And you will find it confusing
to read and you'll think there's

00:43:17.943 --> 00:43:21.409
something wrong with you that
you can't follow it.

00:43:21.409 --> 00:43:25.945
Actually even though most of
what Nozick writes is extremely

00:43:25.945 --> 00:43:30.097
clear, the confusion is
Nozick's, so you shouldn't beat

00:43:30.097 --> 00:43:32.018
yourself up too much.
 

00:43:32.018 --> 00:43:35.492
And I'm going to unpack it in
more detail on Wednesday what

00:43:35.492 --> 00:43:39.474
he's saying and why it matters,
but this is the basic

00:43:39.474 --> 00:43:45.309
intuition: he has to worry about
independents for two reasons.

00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:50.614
One is just to complete his
account of how a government

00:43:50.614 --> 00:43:54.873
would form,
but the other one is normative

00:43:54.873 --> 00:44:01.023
because remember that the social
contract argument depends on the

00:44:01.023 --> 00:44:02.849
idea of consent.
 

00:44:02.849 --> 00:44:06.007
Remember we said the
utilitarian tradition is

00:44:06.007 --> 00:44:09.853
maximizing happiness,
the Marxian tradition is about

00:44:09.853 --> 00:44:13.746
ending exploitation,
the social contract tradition

00:44:13.746 --> 00:44:18.260
is about consent as the basis
for political legitimacy.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:23.896
So even if the whole story
about force being a natural

00:44:23.896 --> 00:44:30.809
monopoly is correct there are
still going to be sort of loony,

00:44:30.809 --> 00:44:34.659
principled anarchists out
there, who don't recognize the

00:44:34.659 --> 00:44:39.530
legitimacy of the state,
you have to worry about.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:45.016
Nozick, writing in 1974,
isn't thinking about the sorts

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:51.010
of people we're thinking about
today in this connection,

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:55.019
and so he talks about some
anarchist wandering around who

00:44:55.019 --> 00:44:57.670
wants to protect their own
rights,

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:02.893
and it has something of a
contrived quality to it in his

00:45:02.893 --> 00:45:04.130
discussion.
 

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:07.240
But think about,
when you read

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:12.391
"Independent,"
think Osama bin Laden or

00:45:12.391 --> 00:45:18.722
Mr. Stack who flew his plane
into the IRS building the other

00:45:18.722 --> 00:45:20.510
day;
these are Nozick's

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:21.289
independents,
these people.

00:45:21.289 --> 00:45:26.286
They say, "We don't
recognize the legitimacy of your

00:45:26.286 --> 00:45:27.000
state.
 

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.340
We don't recognize your
protective association.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:38.190
We're not going to accept
it."

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:44.795
These people are a big problem
for Nozick, as I said both as a

00:45:44.795 --> 00:45:49.018
sort of empirical theoretical
matter;

00:45:49.018 --> 00:45:52.213
he's saying what would happen
with these people,

00:45:52.213 --> 00:45:55.000
but then as a normative matter
as well.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:01.449
So what is his point about
compensation and all of that?

00:46:01.449 --> 00:46:04.559
I'm going to dig into that on
Wednesday.

00:46:04.559 --> 00:46:08.597
I'm just going to tell you now,
briefly, because we're out of

00:46:08.597 --> 00:46:10.010
time, what happens.
 

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.889
He's going to basically say,
"These people are going to

00:46:12.889 --> 00:46:15.329
be forcibly incorporated into
the social order,

00:46:15.329 --> 00:46:20.259
and the theory of compensation
is an account of what makes that

00:46:20.259 --> 00:46:23.358
forcible incorporation
legitimate,"

00:46:23.358 --> 00:46:26.539
and I'll dig into that on
Wednesday.

00:46:26.539 --> 00:46:29.550
 
 

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.409
We're out of time now,
so we'll pick up with that

00:46:32.409 --> 00:46:33.900
right at the beginning.
 

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.090
Cheers.
 

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:40.000

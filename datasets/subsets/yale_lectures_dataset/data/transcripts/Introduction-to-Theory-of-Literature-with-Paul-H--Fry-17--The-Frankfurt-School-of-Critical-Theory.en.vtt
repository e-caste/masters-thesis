00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.141
Prof: As we get into
social perspectives on

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:09.995
literature and art,
you may ask yourself out of

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:14.267
idle curiosity,
or perhaps even peevishly,

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:15.620
"Why Marx?
 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.500
Why so much Marx?
 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.641
Why is it Marx who seems to
stand behind the idea that the

00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:27.962
social criticism of art is the
best and most relevant way to

00:00:27.962 --> 00:00:31.480
approach this subject
matter?"

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.342
Well, it's because whatever the
outcome of Marxist thought may

00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:43.559
have proven to be historically,
it's nevertheless the case to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.050
this day that the most
devastating critique of existing

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.830
ideas about things,
of states of affairs that,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.979
as it were,
meander along without too much

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.121
self-consciousness,
remains the Marxist one,

00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:03.109
together perhaps with the
Freudian one.

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.170
When we turn to Jameson next
time,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.832
we'll see that in both
cases--and we'll be working a

00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:11.878
little bit with this today,
too, when we turn to

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:16.537
Benjamin--we'll see that in both
cases it has to do with the way

00:01:16.537 --> 00:01:21.122
in which we are brought up short
by the kind of criticism which

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:25.558
argues that somehow standing
behind our conception of reality

00:01:25.558 --> 00:01:29.700
and our understanding of our
place in the world,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.330
there is one form or another of
the "unconscious."

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.419
We have, arguably,
in this course in literary

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:45.090
theory first taken up notions of
a linguistic unconscious,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.260
or in any case linguistic
preconditioning,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.680
then taken up notions of a
psychoanalytic unconscious;

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.045
and now, in the very title of
Jameson's book from which we'll

00:01:58.045 --> 00:02:01.608
be considering an excerpt in the
next lecture,

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:06.670
we have the notion of the
political unconscious.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.122
There are other ways of
effecting a social criticism of

00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:14.000
literature and art.
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.866
From the right,
there is an extraordinary book

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:22.318
by Leo Strauss on Aristophanes,
together with his great

00:02:22.318 --> 00:02:26.240
readings of the traditional
texts of political philosophy.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.603
There is, of course,
a very strong liberal

00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:33.036
tradition of criticism,
particularly in the public

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:36.610
sphere, in the journalism of the
public sphere.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.191
Perhaps the most notable
proponent of a liberal criticism

00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:45.772
of art undertaken from a social
point of view is the work

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:50.437
collected in Lionel Trilling's
The Literal- The Liberal

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:51.910
Imagination.
 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.075
So there are options,
but by far the most pervasive

00:02:57.075 --> 00:03:02.050
mode of social critique in
literary theory and in the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.983
modern history of thinking about
literature remains the Marxist

00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:08.938
one.
 

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:14.430
As much as we can be in working
through these materials,

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.021
our concern is of course
primarily with Marxist

00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:20.520
aesthetics.
 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:28.312
What are the options for a
Marxist critic in aesthetic

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:29.490
terms?
 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.318
That's, of course,
what we're going to be taking

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:40.174
up in a moment and also when we
turn to Fredric Jameson on

00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:41.508
Thursday.
 

00:03:41.508 --> 00:03:44.598
In the meantime,
what about Marx?

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:48.925
I think I can take it for
granted in a course of this kind

00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:53.252
that most of you have some
familiarity with the history of

00:03:53.252 --> 00:03:55.910
ideas and with Western culture.
 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.725
I think I can take it for
granted that most of you have

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:05.454
some notion, just as you have
some notion about Freud,

00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:08.128
of what Marx is all about.
 

00:04:08.128 --> 00:04:12.942
Of particular importance for
the kinds of criticism we

00:04:12.942 --> 00:04:17.391
undertake to read in this moment
of the course is,

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:20.660
of course, the idea of
ideology.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.310
Now ideology in the writings of
both Marx and Engels,

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.817
and in all the complex history
of the writings that have

00:04:29.817 --> 00:04:33.420
succeeded them--
they were "founders of

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.690
discursivity"
and there has been great debate

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.274
within the Marxist tradition!--
"ideology"

00:04:40.274 --> 00:04:43.824
is a term about which there has
never been wholehearted

00:04:43.824 --> 00:04:44.680
agreement.
 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.702
Primarily, the disagreement
concerning ideology in this

00:04:49.702 --> 00:04:55.470
tradition has to do with whether
or not ideology ought properly

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.307
to be ascribed to conscious as
well as to unconscious

00:05:00.307 --> 00:05:03.750
preconceptions about the world.
 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.194
In other words,
if I know really to the core

00:05:07.194 --> 00:05:11.680
perfectly well that the moon is
made of green cheese--

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.379
I can prove it,
I have no doubt about it,

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:19.740
and it's not something that I'm
unaware that I think--

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.009
but if at the same time,
if my opinion,

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:28.406
my belief, my expression of
fact to the effect that the moon

00:05:28.406 --> 00:05:33.694
is made of green cheese,
can be demystified as ideology,

00:05:33.694 --> 00:05:36.230
the question is:
well,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.552
is it still ideology if I'm
quite conscious

00:05:38.552 --> 00:05:39.879
&gt;
 

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.413
of knowing that the moon is
made of green cheese and

00:05:43.413 --> 00:05:45.839
prepared to defend my
position?--

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:49.720
just as a kind of belated
aristocrat,

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.622
prepared to defend the idea
that hierarchy and privilege is

00:05:55.622 --> 00:06:00.103
appropriate in society,
is perfectly conscious that

00:06:00.103 --> 00:06:04.177
this is an unpopular idea but
nevertheless fully committed to

00:06:04.177 --> 00:06:06.350
it and prepared to defend it?
 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.497
The question sometimes in
Marxism is, "Is this still

00:06:11.497 --> 00:06:13.060
ideology?"
 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.814
Particularly in the writings of
Engels, perhaps more than in the

00:06:16.814 --> 00:06:19.437
writings of Marx,
the answer by and large is,

00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:20.750
"It is."
 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.961
Ideology is essentially the
belief that perspective is

00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:27.899
truth.
 

00:06:27.899 --> 00:06:31.949
That is to say,
that the way in which things

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:37.600
appear from the material and
economically grounded standpoint

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.910
of my own consciousness is not
just the way they appear to me,

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.209
but the way they actually are.
 

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:52.016
Now this is a mode of belief
which in various historical

00:06:52.016 --> 00:06:57.086
periods, according to Marx,
has characterized each dominant

00:06:57.086 --> 00:06:58.660
class in turn.
 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.478
With the rise of capitalism,
the evolution of capitalism

00:07:03.478 --> 00:07:06.810
into what's called late
capitalism,

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.781
of course this ideology is
primarily what's called

00:07:10.781 --> 00:07:13.778
"the bourgeois
ideology."

00:07:13.778 --> 00:07:17.976
In other words,
the idea that the various

00:07:17.976 --> 00:07:22.098
premises on which bourgeois,
middle class,

00:07:22.098 --> 00:07:25.637
existence is based--the
premises that have allowed for

00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:29.579
the rise and appropriation of
power of the middle class;

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:32.819
the idea, for example,
of the work ethic;

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:37.798
the idea of family;
the idea of certain forms of

00:07:37.798 --> 00:07:41.079
moral behavior--
all of this is

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:46.252
"ideological"
insofar as it is supposed to be

00:07:46.252 --> 00:07:52.093
valid and equally the case for
all in all circumstances at all

00:07:52.093 --> 00:07:55.829
historical times:
in other words,

00:07:55.829 --> 00:08:02.939
the belief that what I see the
world to be is just universally

00:08:02.939 --> 00:08:05.620
the way the world is.
 

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.029
That is the general
characterization of ideology.

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:13.028
Now we've seen this, of course.
 

00:08:13.028 --> 00:08:16.317
We began the course with the
quotation from Marx,

00:08:16.317 --> 00:08:20.430
from Marx's Kapital,
on commodity fetishism.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.675
We've seen this in the way in
which it is just spontaneously

00:08:25.675 --> 00:08:29.362
supposed reflexively,
without reflection,

00:08:29.362 --> 00:08:34.019
that the labor properties of
something that's produced--

00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:37.692
that is to say the value that
can accrue to it because of the

00:08:37.692 --> 00:08:40.080
amount of labor that's gone into
it--

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.792
is actually something that
inheres in the product itself of

00:08:45.792 --> 00:08:46.580
labor.
 

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.279
This, of course,
applies as well to art,

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:52.695
and it's something that
Benjamin is fully aware of

00:08:52.695 --> 00:08:56.529
alluding to when he talks about
"the aura."

00:08:56.529 --> 00:09:01.110
If I forget that art is
produced--

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.379
that a certain quantum of
labor, in other words,

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:10.110
has gone into the emergence of
the work of art--

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.898
and if I simply,
in rapt contemplative

00:09:13.898 --> 00:09:17.746
attention,
address myself to the work of

00:09:17.746 --> 00:09:22.349
art itself as though it had
objective value apart from

00:09:22.349 --> 00:09:26.660
having been produced,
in a mode of production,

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.764
then what I'm doing is
"commodifying"

00:09:30.764 --> 00:09:32.460
the work of art.
 

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.769
From Benjamin's point of view,
in other words,

00:09:34.769 --> 00:09:39.690
to be seduced by the aura of
the work of art is,

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.057
in a certain sense,
to experience the work of art

00:09:44.057 --> 00:09:46.879
ideologically as a commodity.
 

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:47.870
All right.
 

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:53.686
Now returning then to the whole
question of the aesthetic

00:09:53.686 --> 00:09:59.503
objectives of Marxist criticism,
there are basically four

00:09:59.503 --> 00:10:00.750
options.
 

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:04.164
In other words,
Marxist criticism has not

00:10:04.164 --> 00:10:09.470
consistently agreed--
particularly in its more

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:15.272
sophisticated versions--
about what the aesthetic of art

00:10:15.272 --> 00:10:16.918
ought actually to be.
 

00:10:16.918 --> 00:10:21.370
In other words,
how should art reflect society?

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:24.960
How should it constitute a
critique of society?

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.700
How should it predict an ideal,
emergent, utopian society?

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.042
All of these questions are
questions of aesthetics,

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:40.730
because the way in which art
does express the social is

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.990
necessarily aesthetic.
 

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:44.659
It's done through form.
 

00:10:44.659 --> 00:10:46.360
It's done through genre.
 

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.899
It's done as a matter of style.
 

00:10:48.899 --> 00:10:52.956
It's done ultimately,
as the Marxists would say,

00:10:52.956 --> 00:10:56.149
in this or that mode of
production.

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:01.206
All of these mediations of what
you might call the expression of

00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:04.745
society,
then, are understood as the

00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:10.846
aesthetic in Marxist thought and
need to be understood in terms

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:13.110
of possible options.
 

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.745
The aesthetic of Marx and
Engels themselves was realist,

00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:21.961
but it was a kind of realism
that was really rather

00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:23.480
sophisticated.
 

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.171
When aspiring writers,
already with the idea that they

00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:31.490
ought to be writing for the
advancement of the proletariat,

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.389
would write Engels--I'm
thinking of Ferdinand Lassalle,

00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:38.874
Mina Kautsky,
other people--would send Engels

00:11:38.874 --> 00:11:43.389
manuscripts of their sort of
"socialist realist"

00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:45.740
novels,
Engels hated them.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.123
He &gt;
 

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.500
just couldn't stand that kind
of literature,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.769
and he said in effect,
No, no, no, no.

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:56.649
You don't have to glorify the
proletariat.

00:11:56.649 --> 00:12:01.440
You don't have to project a
future in this way.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.317
What you want to do is see,
in a way that exposes it,

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:11.158
the social dynamic as it
exists.

00:12:11.158 --> 00:12:14.847
What you want to do is
understand the world

00:12:14.847 --> 00:12:19.326
realistically but not
tendentiously--that is to say,

00:12:19.326 --> 00:12:22.399
not from an open point of view.
 

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:27.441
Engels' literary hero was
Balzac, who was a royalist

00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:31.000
reactionary but who
nevertheless,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.404
in Engels' view,
was so brilliant in evoking

00:12:35.404 --> 00:12:40.220
society in all of its manifold
complexities,

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.029
particularly in the complexity
of its class structure,

00:12:44.029 --> 00:12:50.268
that this was the appropriate
model for people hoping to

00:12:50.268 --> 00:12:55.259
engage in the business of
realist writing.

00:12:55.259 --> 00:12:58.796
Now this was a mode of thought
that prevailed largely in

00:12:58.796 --> 00:13:01.690
Marxism through its early
energetic years,

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.379
including the early energetic
years of the Revolution itself.

00:13:06.379 --> 00:13:11.389
In 1927, the literary
philosopher Georg Lukacs,

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:15.440
L-u-k-a-c-s,
who had been a kind of Hegelian

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:19.796
theorist of literature--
he'd written a very brilliant

00:13:19.796 --> 00:13:23.804
book called The Theory of the
Novel before he turned to

00:13:23.804 --> 00:13:26.150
Marxist thought--
in 1927 still,

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:30.500
and notice that this is the
same year in which Eichenbaum is

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:34.996
writing his "Theory of the
Formal Method" and

00:13:34.996 --> 00:13:38.830
the same year in which Benjamin
visits Moscow--

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.551
in other words,
a period of real continued

00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:48.177
social and intellectual ferment
within the framework of Marxist

00:13:48.177 --> 00:13:51.865
government--
in 1927 he wrote a book called

00:13:51.865 --> 00:13:56.128
The Historical Novel.
This book reads as though it

00:13:56.128 --> 00:13:58.519
were taken from Engels' letters.
 

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:03.984
It's partly an attack on what
Lukacs took to be the sort of

00:14:03.984 --> 00:14:09.635
narcissistic inwardness of High
Modernism, particularly Joyce

00:14:09.635 --> 00:14:11.048
and Proust.
 

00:14:11.048 --> 00:14:14.950
It's a tendentious attack and
certainly subject to criticism

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.668
on all sorts of grounds.
 

00:14:16.668 --> 00:14:19.950
It's partly that,
but it's also argued just in

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:23.960
the way that Engels championed
Balzac in his letters.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.460
It's a book that champions the
novels of Sir Walter Scott.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.178
Scott, too, was a political
reactionary,

00:14:32.178 --> 00:14:37.144
a Tory, but one whose great
dialectical balances in his

00:14:37.144 --> 00:14:40.730
novels between highland and
lowland,

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.629
feudal and mercantile,
Scotland and England--

00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:50.269
whose balances of an old social
order with an emerging social

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:55.437
order Lukacs took to be perfect
exemplifications of what

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:59.946
realism,
of seeing class relations as

00:14:59.946 --> 00:15:02.879
they really are,
can do.

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:09.291
So this is the tradition of
realist aesthetics in Marxist

00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:15.110
criticism,
but then as--really dating from

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.513
1927,
precisely with the rise of

00:15:18.513 --> 00:15:23.690
Stalin--things began to change,
at least in the Soviet sphere,

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.750
the original ideas of all these
people who used to write to

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.535
Engels--
Mina Kautsky,

00:15:29.535 --> 00:15:32.899
Ferdinand Lassalle,
writers of that kind--

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:36.230
began to prevail in Soviet
thought.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:42.673
There was a literary critic
named Zhnadov who articulated a

00:15:42.673 --> 00:15:46.230
doctrine of socialist realism.
 

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:51.226
Even Marxist critics themselves
in those days devised a sort of

00:15:51.226 --> 00:15:55.740
joke about the sort of novel
that Zhnadov had in mind.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.240
You probably know the joke:
Boy meets tractor,

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:03.331
boy loses tractor,
boy goes to the city to find

00:16:03.331 --> 00:16:05.447
tractor,
finds tractor,

00:16:05.447 --> 00:16:09.268
continues to be in love,
takes tractor back to the

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:12.139
countryside and lives happily
ever after.

00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:15.523
This fundamental plot,
obviously a variant on the

00:16:15.523 --> 00:16:18.907
marriage plot that very much
engaged also in what

00:16:18.907 --> 00:16:20.740
&gt;
 

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.020
Benjamin would call "the
mechanical aspect of

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.210
reproduction"--
&gt;

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.610
&gt;
 

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:33.712
this sort of plot as the
characteristic plot of socialist

00:16:33.712 --> 00:16:37.450
realism began to take hold
officially,

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:42.168
so that in 1934 the Soviet
culture minister,

00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:46.846
Bukharin, convened an
International Soviet Writers

00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:52.384
Conference in which it was
simply decreed from on high that

00:16:52.384 --> 00:16:58.590
henceforth literary practice
would consist in the promotion,

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:02.690
of an exemplification of,
socialist realism.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:06.303
This continued really right up
until the fall of the Iron

00:17:06.303 --> 00:17:10.192
Curtain in 1989,
since until then there really

00:17:10.192 --> 00:17:15.520
was a form of censorship abroad
in Soviet and Soviet sphere

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:20.390
societies to the effect that
literature was subject to

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.472
challenge,
possibly to suppression,

00:17:24.472 --> 00:17:29.808
if it didn't adhere to
socialist realist tenets.

00:17:29.808 --> 00:17:33.997
So those are the forms of
realism that I think are most

00:17:33.997 --> 00:17:38.960
often identified with Marxist
criticism and its possibilities;

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.734
but as a matter of fact,
probably the most dynamic

00:17:42.734 --> 00:17:47.435
criticism since Lukacs of the
twentieth century has recognized

00:17:47.435 --> 00:17:51.779
that realism is something that,
after all, from a Marxist

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:55.737
perspective can easily be shown
to have been commandeered by the

00:17:55.737 --> 00:17:56.680
bourgeoisie.
 

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.930
Who else "tells it like it
is"?

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:04.368
Who else insists that reality
is just one drink below par?

00:18:04.368 --> 00:18:09.430
Who else insists that he or she
is a realist?--

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:14.309
other than the characteristic
sort of middle class person who

00:18:14.309 --> 00:18:17.318
tells you that they've been
there,

00:18:17.318 --> 00:18:20.838
done that and know everything
that there is to know?

00:18:20.838 --> 00:18:24.317
The middle class in other
words, from the standpoint of

00:18:24.317 --> 00:18:26.700
much Marxist thought since
Lukacs,

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.268
has commandeered for
itself--just as it commandeers

00:18:30.268 --> 00:18:34.922
everything else for itself--
has commandeered for itself the

00:18:34.922 --> 00:18:38.568
idea of realism which has
therefore become,

00:18:38.568 --> 00:18:42.838
in these views,
outmoded aesthetically.

00:18:42.838 --> 00:18:47.298
Now Benjamin is himself acutely
conscious of this problem,

00:18:47.298 --> 00:18:54.493
and he insists that realism in
a variety of ways is a kind of

00:18:54.493 --> 00:19:00.250
late capitalist form of
commodifying the aura.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:05.932
It is the last gasp of
bourgeois art in a variety of

00:19:05.932 --> 00:19:08.828
ways, he says hopefully.
 

00:19:08.828 --> 00:19:13.083
It needs to be counteracted
with what he takes to be a

00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:18.220
participatory aesthetic:
an aesthetic of the fragment,

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:25.190
an aesthetic of intermittent
attention of participation,

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.146
which does not,
nevertheless,

00:19:28.146 --> 00:19:34.482
in any way involve a sense of
persistently contemplating that

00:19:34.482 --> 00:19:39.306
which is real,
but emphasizes rather the idea

00:19:39.306 --> 00:19:44.565
that one is oneself in a
communal spirit engaged with the

00:19:44.565 --> 00:19:49.823
very mode of production of the
work of art and somehow or

00:19:49.823 --> 00:19:52.640
another involved in that.
 

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.348
That's what we'll come back to
when we turn to Benjamin's

00:19:56.348 --> 00:19:58.470
"Work of Art"
essay.

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:03.020
Perhaps the most unusual
aesthetic move for a Marxist

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:07.308
critic is the one that you will
find in Adorno.

00:20:07.308 --> 00:20:12.701
Adorno was devoted to precisely
what Lukacs had attacked in

00:20:12.701 --> 00:20:17.627
The Historical Novel,
namely the High Modernist

00:20:17.627 --> 00:20:18.930
aesthetic.
 

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.670
He admired Beckett in
literature.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.660
He admired Schoenberg,
Berg, and Webern in music.

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.178
Adorno was by training a
musicologist,

00:20:29.178 --> 00:20:34.219
and he devoted much of his
writing career to producing

00:20:34.219 --> 00:20:39.828
essays and treatises on music
and the history of music.

00:20:39.828 --> 00:20:44.150
These were heroes in Adorno's
pantheon,

00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.313
and of course,
the question arises:

00:20:46.313 --> 00:20:50.259
how can these people who have
nothing to say about society,

00:20:50.259 --> 00:20:53.338
who are totally preoccupied
with form,

00:20:53.338 --> 00:20:56.769
and who seem to be indifferent
to the whole course of history--

00:20:56.769 --> 00:21:01.808
how can these people be the
aesthetic heroes of a Marxist

00:21:01.808 --> 00:21:02.618
critic?
 

00:21:02.618 --> 00:21:07.237
This is something you see much
more clearly in the "Fetish

00:21:07.237 --> 00:21:09.098
Character"
essay,

00:21:09.098 --> 00:21:12.526
from which I've given you the
two excerpts which I hope you

00:21:12.526 --> 00:21:12.940
have.
 

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:17.868
I want to pause over them
because I think Adorno's essay--

00:21:17.868 --> 00:21:21.578
while perhaps a little
quixotic, because after all,

00:21:21.578 --> 00:21:26.108
who ever could profit from a
concept of this kind?--

00:21:26.108 --> 00:21:31.480
Adorno's essay is nevertheless
rather brilliant in its

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.130
distinction between the
totality,

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.888
or wholeness,
that's offered to you by

00:21:38.888 --> 00:21:44.681
artistic form and the mere
totalization or totalitarianism

00:21:44.681 --> 00:21:51.490
that's offered to you by modern
hegemonic forms of government--

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:57.130
whether truly totalitarian or
insidiously totalitarian like,

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.025
for example,
the "culture

00:21:59.025 --> 00:22:01.836
industry"
to which he devotes the essay

00:22:01.836 --> 00:22:03.210
that you've read.
 

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.588
So this is what Adorno says in
these two passages.

00:22:06.588 --> 00:22:11.859
He's talking about the way in
which people in the culture

00:22:11.859 --> 00:22:17.599
industry who appreciate music
are completely victimized by the

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:22.483
coloratura local effect,
what you might call--this is a

00:22:22.483 --> 00:22:26.539
conductor whom Adorno hated--
the Toscanini effect:

00:22:26.539 --> 00:22:31.608
that flourishing of a
particular moment in a concerto,

00:22:31.608 --> 00:22:36.318
the riding it into the ground
at the expense of the whole,

00:22:36.318 --> 00:22:41.525
and everything that has what
Adorno elsewhere calls

00:22:41.525 --> 00:22:45.170
"lip-smacking
euphony";

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.660
in other words,
a kind of cultivation of

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:53.583
perfection of local sound,
as opposed to an awareness of

00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:55.910
the total composition.
 

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.710
So he says in the first
passage:

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:02.391
The delight in the moment and
the gay façade become an

00:23:02.391 --> 00:23:06.760
excuse for absolving the
listener from the thought of the

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.122
whole,
whose claim is comprised in

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:11.788
proper listening.
 

00:23:11.788 --> 00:23:17.567
The listener is converted along
his line of least resistance

00:23:17.567 --> 00:23:22.461
[because after all,
it's so beautiful to listen to]

00:23:22.461 --> 00:23:25.890
into the acquiescent purchaser.
 

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:29.923
No longer do the partial
moments serve as a critique of

00:23:29.923 --> 00:23:33.358
the whole as they sometimes do
in Modernism.

00:23:33.358 --> 00:23:35.421
[Dissonance,
in other words,

00:23:35.421 --> 00:23:40.154
is in and of itself a critique
of that overarching harmony with

00:23:40.154 --> 00:23:43.210
which we associate wholeness,
right?

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:46.280
So there's a real sense in
which the parts can be

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.056
understood as a critique of the
whole without challenging or

00:23:50.056 --> 00:23:53.192
breaking down the whole.]
No longer do the partial

00:23:53.192 --> 00:23:56.200
moments serve as a critique of
the whole.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:02.107
Instead they suspend the
critique which the successful

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:07.682
aesthetic totality exerts
against the flawed one of

00:24:07.682 --> 00:24:09.019
society.
 

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:13.844
In other words,
nothing can criticize the

00:24:13.844 --> 00:24:20.719
inauthenticity of the bad
totalities of society except the

00:24:20.719 --> 00:24:27.472
authenticity of a genuine
achieved wholeness in a work of

00:24:27.472 --> 00:24:28.680
art.
 

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:34.078
The difference between these
senses of the whole is precisely

00:24:34.078 --> 00:24:38.848
the zone of critique which in
Adorno's view might--

00:24:38.848 --> 00:24:46.079
just might--awaken the victim
of the culture industry from the

00:24:46.079 --> 00:24:51.769
slumbers of happy conformism and
acquiescence.

00:24:51.769 --> 00:24:56.180
Now in the second passage,
just to reinforce this:

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.348
Great Modernist composers like
Berg,

00:24:58.348 --> 00:25:01.643
Schoenberg and Webern are
called individualists by other

00:25:01.643 --> 00:25:06.749
Marxist critics [in other words,
by people like Lukacs who don't

00:25:06.749 --> 00:25:11.505
like what Lukacs would call
"fetishization of

00:25:11.505 --> 00:25:16.843
form," reification of form
at the expense of social

00:25:16.843 --> 00:25:21.945
reference and expression],
and yet their work is nothing

00:25:21.945 --> 00:25:25.319
but a single dialogue with the
powers that destroy

00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:28.740
individuality,
powers whose formless shadows

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.298
fall gigantically on their
music.

00:25:31.298 --> 00:25:34.480
In music, too,
collective powers are

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.480
liquidating an individuality
past saving,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:42.884
but against them only
individuals are capable of

00:25:42.884 --> 00:25:47.759
consciously representing the
aims of collectivity.

00:25:47.759 --> 00:25:52.308
In other words,
the totality--the achieved,

00:25:52.308 --> 00:25:56.575
successful, authentic
totality--of the work of art

00:25:56.575 --> 00:26:01.188
models the totality of a
collective state in ways that

00:26:01.188 --> 00:26:06.585
none of the false totalities of
current hegemonies can possibly

00:26:06.585 --> 00:26:09.108
do or even approximate.
 

00:26:09.108 --> 00:26:12.294
In other words,
there is an implicit

00:26:12.294 --> 00:26:16.568
politics--in Adorno's
argument--in pure form.

00:26:16.568 --> 00:26:22.805
The achievement of pure form,
which is after all a collection

00:26:22.805 --> 00:26:27.481
of parts, is an implicit
politics modeling the

00:26:27.481 --> 00:26:31.640
achievement of a collective
society.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.410
So that is the argument of
Adorno.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:35.529
It's a fascinating one.
 

00:26:35.529 --> 00:26:40.141
As I say, it's perhaps somewhat
quixotic because it's kind of

00:26:40.141 --> 00:26:44.598
hard to imagine anyone actually
listening to Schoenberg and

00:26:44.598 --> 00:26:46.288
saying, "Gee.
 

00:26:46.288 --> 00:26:47.900
Maybe I should be a
communist."

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.038
&gt;
 

00:26:51.038 --> 00:26:54.200
Actually putting this to work,
in other words,

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.588
entails a certain amount of
difficulty,

00:26:57.588 --> 00:27:00.460
but at the same time,
intellectually,

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:04.008
it seems to me to be a
fascinating turn of thought and

00:27:04.008 --> 00:27:06.818
one that certainly does give one
pause,

00:27:06.818 --> 00:27:11.788
if only because Marxist
criticism is so often engaged in

00:27:11.788 --> 00:27:17.210
a critique of what it takes to
be the mainstream aesthetic of

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:20.988
Western civilization,
which is a kind of

00:27:20.988 --> 00:27:23.210
fetishization of wholeness.
 

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.522
Think of the New Criticism,
the unity of the poem,

00:27:27.522 --> 00:27:32.190
the discrete ontological object
as a unified whole.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.455
This is, of course,
commonplace in being attacked

00:27:36.455 --> 00:27:40.375
by Marxist criticism,
and it's very interesting to

00:27:40.375 --> 00:27:44.451
see a figure like Adorno,
a champion of this very

00:27:44.451 --> 00:27:49.769
wholeness, who sees it as a
model not of narcissistic

00:27:49.769 --> 00:27:54.150
individuality,
but rather of collectivity.

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:54.798
All right.
 

00:27:54.798 --> 00:27:58.288
Finally--and I won't pause much
over this because it's going to

00:27:58.288 --> 00:28:00.538
be the subject of Thursday's
lecture--

00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:07.190
the last aesthetic option for
Marxism is a surprising one.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:12.092
It actually goes back to a book
by Ernst Bloch called The

00:28:12.092 --> 00:28:17.244
Principle of Hope, in
which Bloch essentially argues

00:28:17.244 --> 00:28:20.318
that in the world as we have
it--

00:28:20.318 --> 00:28:24.170
in other words,
the grinding down of hope,

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:29.184
the grinding down of
possibility for all in late

00:28:29.184 --> 00:28:33.464
capitalism--
there is no longer any hope

00:28:33.464 --> 00:28:34.598
available.
 

00:28:34.598 --> 00:28:40.180
This is a kind of gloomy
prognosis with which Bloch

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:45.650
counters the idea that
especially in folk art,

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:51.240
folkways, oral culture and in
popular culture--

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.093
in other words,
in the expressions of longing

00:28:55.093 --> 00:29:00.608
one finds in the work of the
dispossessed and the oppressed--

00:29:00.608 --> 00:29:05.380
there is a kind of utopianism,
a romance,

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.538
and a sense not so much of
wishing for something past,

00:29:09.538 --> 00:29:13.548
even though it seems to take
the form of nostalgia,

00:29:13.548 --> 00:29:18.048
but rather a projection of a
possibility on the future which

00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:21.250
is simply unavailable in the
real world.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.019
Of course, the best example I
can think of is "The Big

00:29:25.019 --> 00:29:26.838
Rock Candy Mountain."
 

00:29:26.838 --> 00:29:31.296
This is a song sung by people
on chain gangs about liquor

00:29:31.296 --> 00:29:35.275
running down the sides of
mountains in rivulets and

00:29:35.275 --> 00:29:38.140
everything just as it should be.
 

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.664
"The Big Rock Candy
Mountain,"

00:29:39.664 --> 00:29:43.211
in other words,
is a perfect example of the

00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:49.630
"principle of hope"
as Ernst Bloch understands it.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.060
This is something that's picked
up and taken very seriously by

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:56.553
Fredric Jameson,
not so much in the excerpt from

00:29:56.553 --> 00:30:01.086
The Political Unconscious
that you'll be reading for

00:30:01.086 --> 00:30:05.307
the lecture but in an earlier
part of that introductory

00:30:05.307 --> 00:30:09.684
chapter in which he talks about
the importance of romance

00:30:09.684 --> 00:30:13.750
replacing the bankrupt aesthetic
of realism--

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:17.406
the aesthetic of realism that
has been appropriated by the

00:30:17.406 --> 00:30:20.806
bourgeoisie--
and as expressing in a

00:30:20.806 --> 00:30:27.228
seemingly hopeless world the
hopes of the oppressed and the

00:30:27.228 --> 00:30:29.000
dispossessed.
 

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.672
So this too,
the idea of romance,

00:30:32.672 --> 00:30:39.883
the idea of utopian evocation,
is a last, viable aesthetic for

00:30:39.883 --> 00:30:45.075
a certain turn of Marxist
thought which has been

00:30:45.075 --> 00:30:51.150
interesting and productive in
the twentieth century.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:51.808
All right.
 

00:30:51.808 --> 00:30:56.082
So today we take our numbers
two and three,

00:30:56.082 --> 00:31:01.779
the participatory aesthetic of
Benjamin and the Modernist

00:31:01.779 --> 00:31:04.118
totality of Adorno.
 

00:31:04.118 --> 00:31:10.160
We see the way in which they
conflict with each other.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.644
Now in some ways I wish we were
still reading the "Fetish

00:31:13.644 --> 00:31:16.273
Character"
essay because it has more to do

00:31:16.273 --> 00:31:19.874
with aesthetics than the excerpt
you have in your book by Adorno

00:31:19.874 --> 00:31:23.358
and Horkheimer called "The
Culture Industry";

00:31:23.358 --> 00:31:25.703
but "The Culture
Industry,"

00:31:25.703 --> 00:31:26.994
too,
is a response,

00:31:26.994 --> 00:31:29.798
as was the "Fetish
Character in Music"

00:31:29.798 --> 00:31:33.663
which was published 1938,
to Benjamin's "Work of Art

00:31:33.663 --> 00:31:36.759
in the Age of Mechanical
Reproduction."

00:31:36.759 --> 00:31:41.080
Adorno was a close friend of
Benjamin's and exchanged letters

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.328
about Benjamin's "Work of
Art" essay with him--

00:31:45.328 --> 00:31:48.338
letters, by the way,
which were republished in

00:31:48.338 --> 00:31:50.880
The New Left Review of
1973,

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.740
for those of you who are
interested in looking at them,

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:57.740
because this is another source
of ways of seeing how Benjamin

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.660
and Adorno were in conflict over
this matter.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:06.323
Adorno and Benjamin,
as I say, were very close

00:32:06.323 --> 00:32:07.358
friends.
 

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:14.174
Benjamin was only for a
relatively brief period in the

00:32:14.174 --> 00:32:17.390
1930s a Marxist critic.
 

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:22.273
He had hitherto been much more
interested in cabalistic

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:27.519
literature and in the Hegelian
tradition of philosophy,

00:32:27.519 --> 00:32:32.788
and even in the 1930s he was
famously torn between two

00:32:32.788 --> 00:32:34.380
possibilities.
 

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:38.328
He had visited Moscow in 1926,
'27.

00:32:38.328 --> 00:32:42.077
He had become interested in
what was still,

00:32:42.077 --> 00:32:46.987
after all, as I've said,
a vibrant culture in the Soviet

00:32:46.987 --> 00:32:47.880
world.
 

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.949
At the same time,
he had become very close

00:32:50.949 --> 00:32:54.915
friends with the Marxist
playwright Bertolt Brecht and

00:32:54.915 --> 00:32:58.660
had fallen also very much under
his influence.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:02.868
But another very close friend,
a friend equally influential,

00:33:02.868 --> 00:33:06.828
was the Jewish theologian
Gershom Scholem,

00:33:06.828 --> 00:33:12.288
who had emigrated to Jerusalem,
who was a Zionist,

00:33:12.288 --> 00:33:18.808
and who wanted Benjamin to join
him studying the Torah in

00:33:18.808 --> 00:33:24.980
Jerusalem and to engage himself
in that community,

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:29.982
as opposed to the sort of
international Marxist community

00:33:29.982 --> 00:33:34.450
toward which Benjamin was
perhaps more leaning,

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:38.400
especially owing to his
friendship with Brecht.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.337
So even in the 1930s,
even in the period when

00:33:41.337 --> 00:33:45.211
Benjamin wrote his "Work of
Art" essay and also a

00:33:45.211 --> 00:33:48.365
shorter,
even more tendentious essay

00:33:48.365 --> 00:33:51.836
called "The Author as
Producer,"

00:33:51.836 --> 00:33:54.470
1936,
an essay in which he actually

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.534
takes up at length something he
mentions in passing in "The

00:33:58.534 --> 00:34:00.338
Work of Art"
essay--

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:03.098
that is to say,
the way in which in Russia

00:34:03.098 --> 00:34:07.271
everybody is judged not just for
being able to do a job but for

00:34:07.271 --> 00:34:10.099
being able to talk about doing a
job,

00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:12.489
to be able to write it up,
to describe it,

00:34:12.489 --> 00:34:16.353
to write a brochure about it,
to write a letter to the paper

00:34:16.353 --> 00:34:18.806
about it,
and in other words to

00:34:18.806 --> 00:34:23.728
participate, to be engaged not
just in the labor force but also

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:28.331
in reflections on the labor
force in a way that really does

00:34:28.331 --> 00:34:32.617
mean that everyone can be an
author and also that every

00:34:32.617 --> 00:34:35.679
author is a producer--
that is to say,

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:39.751
engaged in writing,
which is part and parcel of the

00:34:39.751 --> 00:34:44.219
productions of labor,
all of this was a focus of

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:47.056
Benjamin's--
at the same time,

00:34:47.056 --> 00:34:51.594
even within this focus,
part of him is being torn in

00:34:51.594 --> 00:34:53.090
another direction.
 

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:57.103
No one can for a minute,
in reading the "Work of

00:34:57.103 --> 00:35:00.724
Art" essay,
fail to notice that Benjamin

00:35:00.724 --> 00:35:04.960
evinces tremendous nostalgia for
the "aura."

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:10.005
It's not an easy thing for
Benjamin to say we have to tear

00:35:10.005 --> 00:35:14.963
down the aura and replace it
with a kind of participatory

00:35:14.963 --> 00:35:19.478
mode that engages with and is
involved in mechanical

00:35:19.478 --> 00:35:21.159
reproduction.
 

00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:25.052
I don't know:
when I was a student I worked

00:35:25.052 --> 00:35:28.690
on and off--
I did this for years--in an art

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:33.070
supply and picture framing store
on the Berkeley campus,

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:37.016
and of course,
every student needed a picture

00:35:37.016 --> 00:35:41.141
to put in his room;
so we had huge stacks of Van

00:35:41.141 --> 00:35:45.626
Gogh's Sunflowers and
Matisse's Dancers and

00:35:45.626 --> 00:35:48.541
certain other paintings,
all of them

00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:50.768
eighteen-by-twenty-four,
which we called

00:35:50.768 --> 00:35:52.130
"brushstroke prints."
 

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.739
They were mounted on cardboard,
and a huge--

00:35:54.739 --> 00:35:58.425
whhhhoooom!--cookie-cutter of
some kind would come down on top

00:35:58.425 --> 00:36:01.393
of them,
actually laminating into the

00:36:01.393 --> 00:36:04.518
print the appearance of
brushstrokes.

00:36:04.518 --> 00:36:07.068
These things,
if you squinted at the

00:36:07.068 --> 00:36:11.800
beginning of a semester you saw
the stack going down like this.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.460
[Gestures.]
Then before you knew it,

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.440
the stacks were gone,
and so you knew for a fact,

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.070
because you knew how many
prints were in that stack,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:25.067
that 240 students' rooms were
festooned with Van Gogh's

00:36:25.067 --> 00:36:29.510
Sunflowers and
&gt;

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.579
&gt;
 

00:36:30.579 --> 00:36:32.210
Matisse's Dancers.
 

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:35.266
You said to yourself,
This is the fruit of mechanical

00:36:35.266 --> 00:36:36.150
reproduction?
 

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:42.304
You asked yourself,
again, Just what is the value

00:36:42.304 --> 00:36:45.639
of this as an aesthetic?
 

00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:47.518
Yeah, it takes it out of the
museum.

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:51.858
Yeah, it means that nobody has
to pay fifty bucks in order to

00:36:51.858 --> 00:36:55.909
wait in a long line in order to
get a peep at the Mona

00:36:55.909 --> 00:36:56.849
Lisa.
 

00:36:56.849 --> 00:37:00.070
Yeah, it really does bring it
home to the people,

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:04.951
but how and in what way and at
the expense of what genuine

00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:09.206
knowledge of art history,
and even of Van Gogh and

00:37:09.206 --> 00:37:11.840
Matisse, does the
fetishization--

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.684
because it is,
after all,

00:37:12.684 --> 00:37:13.530
&gt;
 

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.050
fetishization--of these little
mechanically reproduced

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.110
brushstroke prints amount to?
 

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.539
Obviously, this introduces
complications,

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:24.380
and they're complications--the
whole point of my anecdote--

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:28.222
they're complications of which
Benjamin is far from being

00:37:28.222 --> 00:37:28.909
unaware.
 

00:37:28.909 --> 00:37:34.449
He knows extremely well that,
after all, the greatest threat

00:37:34.449 --> 00:37:39.800
to an aesthetic of the kind he
propounds is that it can be

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.429
commandeered by capital.
 

00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:44.320
Of course, I'm getting ahead of
myself,

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.887
because that's precisely what
Adorno says in opposition to

00:37:48.887 --> 00:37:51.661
him,
but in the meantime that was

00:37:51.661 --> 00:37:54.820
the situation of Benjamin in the
1930s.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.110
Adorno, in the meantime,
had gone to the United States.

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.239
Benjamin was living in Paris
ever since 1933.

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:05.610
Adorno had gone to the United
States, which he hated.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:11.657
The gloom of Adorno's view of
the world is not so much the

00:38:11.657 --> 00:38:18.130
result of his experience of the
weak forms of democracy in the

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:22.268
Weimar Republic,
sort of ominous as those

00:38:22.268 --> 00:38:25.655
experiences were;
not even perhaps so much the

00:38:25.655 --> 00:38:28.661
rise of Nazism,
because like Benjamin he was

00:38:28.661 --> 00:38:30.130
able to flee that.
 

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:34.329
The gloom that he felt and the
gloom that pervades his writing,

00:38:34.329 --> 00:38:38.289
which after all starts in the
mid 1940s,

00:38:38.289 --> 00:38:42.420
is the result of his exposure
to American culture.

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.809
He simply could not stand us or
our culture.

00:38:46.809 --> 00:38:48.820
He couldn't stand
"jazz."

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.672
Remember this was not yet the
age of bebop,

00:38:51.672 --> 00:38:55.610
and I've always felt that maybe
if Adorno had hung around a

00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:58.869
little longer he could have been
reconciled.

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:03.860
It was no longer the jazz of
the aptly named conductor Paul

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.409
Whiteman.
 

00:39:05.409 --> 00:39:12.030
It was jazz that was somewhat
more serious.

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:13.840
He couldn't stand the movies.
 

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:17.460
I have just been,
for purposes I won't go into,

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.275
watching a film called
"Broadway Melody of

00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:26.420
1940" with Fred Astaire and
Eleanor Powell tap dancing.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.447
Fred Astaire and his sidekick,
George Murphy,

00:39:30.447 --> 00:39:35.389
are grabbed out of obscurity in
order to be the leading

00:39:35.389 --> 00:39:38.320
gentlemen of Eleanor Powell.
 

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.570
It's a perfect sort of Samuel
Smiles success story,

00:39:41.570 --> 00:39:45.534
replete with the necessity of
occasional self-sacrifice on the

00:39:45.534 --> 00:39:47.159
part of both of them.
 

00:39:47.159 --> 00:39:51.739
It is made for the wrath of
Adorno, this film.

00:39:51.739 --> 00:39:54.090
&gt;
 

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:58.467
It's nevertheless,
in ways that Adorno could not

00:39:58.467 --> 00:40:02.659
possibly ever come to feel,
quite charming.

00:40:02.659 --> 00:40:07.409
But Adorno wanted no part of
American culture.

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:12.398
He was in anticipation of that
whole trend of American

00:40:12.398 --> 00:40:17.954
sociology obsessed with the way
in which American society is

00:40:17.954 --> 00:40:20.590
dominated by conformism.
 

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.260
He takes this to be the effect,
the result,

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:28.396
of the pervasive,
oppressive thumb of the culture

00:40:28.396 --> 00:40:30.985
industry,
so that our very

00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:34.331
eccentricities,
our very quirks and little

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:37.393
originalities,
all of them are assessed

00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:39.719
carefully by the culture
industry.

00:40:39.719 --> 00:40:43.500
A niche is found for them,
and the next thing you know,

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.440
we're suborned just like
everybody else.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:52.143
There is for Adorno no sideways
escape from the monolithic,

00:40:52.143 --> 00:40:57.161
ubiquitous surveillance and
dominance of the culture

00:40:57.161 --> 00:40:58.440
industry.
 

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:01.809
All right.
 

00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:06.097
Now the "Work of Art in
the Age of Mechanical

00:41:06.097 --> 00:41:10.297
Reproduction"
is influenced obviously by the

00:41:10.297 --> 00:41:15.284
promise of Russian art before
1934: the films of Vertov in

00:41:15.284 --> 00:41:19.353
particular,
and other ways in which it's

00:41:19.353 --> 00:41:24.695
possible for Benjamin to say
that the spectator really can be

00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:26.210
a participant.
 

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:32.894
It's possible for Benjamin to
say that in such contexts it's a

00:41:32.894 --> 00:41:39.690
good thing that the pedastaled
aura of the work of art has been

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:44.965
successfully torn down,
that we no longer stand in

00:41:44.965 --> 00:41:49.634
rapturous attention and in
contemplative postures before

00:41:49.634 --> 00:41:54.726
works of art but that we reach
out to them and they reach out

00:41:54.726 --> 00:41:55.659
to us.
 

00:41:55.659 --> 00:41:58.599
We meet halfway and we become
engaged with them;

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:00.369
we become part of them.
 

00:42:00.369 --> 00:42:03.000
Now how does this work in this
essay?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.987
Primarily through the insertion
of the labor function of the

00:42:09.987 --> 00:42:14.369
apparatus in the represented
field.

00:42:14.369 --> 00:42:19.389
Now this is a complicated idea
that Benjamin develops in

00:42:19.389 --> 00:42:20.760
various ways.
 

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:25.760
What he means by this is that
the spectator sees the object,

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.079
sees whatever the field in
question is,

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:32.820
from the perspective of the
mode of production--

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.164
that is to say,
the spectator participates by

00:42:37.164 --> 00:42:41.409
joining the process of
production.

00:42:41.409 --> 00:42:46.130
Most obviously this means that
when I watch a film,

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.623
I see the film,
necessarily of course,

00:42:49.623 --> 00:42:53.590
from the standpoint of the
camera eye;

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:58.429
my eye, in other words,
joins that of the camera.

00:42:58.429 --> 00:43:01.268
Very interesting that in Berlin
in the 1930s,

00:43:01.268 --> 00:43:05.324
Christopher Isherwood in his
Berlin Stories wrote one

00:43:05.324 --> 00:43:09.172
story called "I Am a
Camera" that took place in

00:43:09.172 --> 00:43:09.929
Berlin.
 

00:43:09.929 --> 00:43:13.362
I have often thought there's
some sort of symbiosis between

00:43:13.362 --> 00:43:16.498
the notion of "I Am a
Camera" in Christopher

00:43:16.498 --> 00:43:19.989
Isherwood and the way in which
it may be appropriated--

00:43:19.989 --> 00:43:22.679
or it may simply be a happy
coincidence--

00:43:22.679 --> 00:43:25.030
in the work of Benjamin.
 

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.630
But in a certain sense for
Benjamin, the spectator,

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:32.231
in order to be a participant,
is the camera,

00:43:32.231 --> 00:43:35.039
is in other words the camera's
eye.

00:43:35.039 --> 00:43:36.530
What is the consequence of this?
 

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:39.411
Well, the spectator is,
in a certain sense,

00:43:39.411 --> 00:43:41.059
then, a critic.
 

00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:44.817
Benjamin keeps comparing the
eye of the camera with a

00:43:44.817 --> 00:43:46.190
"test."
 

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:49.829
He even compares it with the
vocational aptitude test.

00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:54.233
It's as though what in the
theater would count as an

00:43:54.233 --> 00:43:56.766
audition--
I appear before the director,

00:43:56.766 --> 00:43:58.780
I recite certain lines of the
script,

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:02.797
and I'm either told to come
back another day or I'm given

00:44:02.797 --> 00:44:05.719
the part--
it's as though to substitute

00:44:05.719 --> 00:44:10.132
what counts as an audition with
the perpetual audition of the

00:44:10.132 --> 00:44:14.213
film actor before the camera,
because after all,

00:44:14.213 --> 00:44:19.820
there is the camera recording
what the film actor is doing--

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.690
not this camera up here,
by the way--

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.664
but ordinarily,
the camera has the option of

00:44:24.664 --> 00:44:27.710
later on throwing out what isn't
any good.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:28.380
&gt;
 

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.224
Would that they [gestures to
film crew]

00:44:31.224 --> 00:44:34.070
could, but the film camera can
edit.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.929
The film camera is part of an
editing "process,

00:44:36.929 --> 00:44:41.554
so that the actor in front of
the camera is perpetually being

00:44:41.554 --> 00:44:46.255
tested and auditioned in just
the way that you might be tested

00:44:46.255 --> 00:44:50.648
or auditioned if you took a
vocational aptitude test for a

00:44:50.648 --> 00:44:51.420
job.
 

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:54.612
That's Benjamin's point,
and what he means to say is

00:44:54.612 --> 00:44:58.431
that if the spectator then takes
the camera's eye position the

00:44:58.431 --> 00:45:01.322
spectator,
him- or herself then becomes a

00:45:01.322 --> 00:45:04.039
critic,
like a sports fan.

00:45:04.039 --> 00:45:08.610
Benjamin doesn't pretend for a
moment that to become a critic

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:12.420
of this kind is to be a good
critic--not at all.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.802
Benjamin agrees with people who
say, "Well,

00:45:14.802 --> 00:45:16.780
we go to the movies when we're
tired.

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.630
All we want is to be
entertained."

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:21.889
In fact, we are
distracted.

00:45:21.889 --> 00:45:25.268
We are critics,
as Benjamin argues,

00:45:25.268 --> 00:45:28.050
in a state of distraction.
 

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.219
The German word is
Zerstreutheit.

00:45:30.219 --> 00:45:32.079
We are zerstreut.
 

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:34.625
We are perpetually,
in other words,

00:45:34.625 --> 00:45:39.117
not quite paying attention even
while at the same time we are

00:45:39.117 --> 00:45:43.010
seeing things from the
camera-eye point of view.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:45.965
To see things from the camera--
I'll come back to distraction in

00:45:45.965 --> 00:45:48.929
a minute--
from the camera-eye point of

00:45:48.929 --> 00:45:53.469
view is a position of privilege
because it exposes,

00:45:53.469 --> 00:45:56.018
as Benjamin tells us again and
again,

00:45:56.018 --> 00:46:01.268
things about reality that we
wouldn't otherwise notice.

00:46:01.268 --> 00:46:05.092
The camera is capable of slow
motion, and it's capable of

00:46:05.092 --> 00:46:08.710
angles of incidence that we
couldn't otherwise see.

00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:11.760
It's capable of all kinds of
effects.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.018
Let me enumerate them.
 

00:46:13.018 --> 00:46:19.735
I think it's on page 1235 at
the top of the left-hand column:

00:46:19.735 --> 00:46:24.550
"â€¦photographic
reproduction,

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.804
with the aid of certain
processes, such as enlargement

00:46:27.804 --> 00:46:32.032
or slow motion,
can capture images which escape

00:46:32.032 --> 00:46:34.250
natural vision."
 

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:38.380
Then on page 1245,
he gives this process a name.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.764
He says, "The camera
introduces us to unconscious

00:46:42.764 --> 00:46:46.737
optics just as does
psychoanalysis to unconscious

00:46:46.737 --> 00:46:48.309
impulses."
 

00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:51.597
In other words,
the camera's-eye point of view

00:46:51.597 --> 00:46:53.789
is a privileged perspective.
 

00:46:53.789 --> 00:46:57.280
It does show us things as they
are or,

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.840
perhaps if not as they are,
at least it reminds us that

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.664
things as we see them with the
naked eye aren't necessarily

00:47:04.664 --> 00:47:06.510
"as they are."
 

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:10.594
It's not, perhaps,
so much a notion of privileging

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:15.179
what the camera sees as real
over against what I see.

00:47:15.179 --> 00:47:18.730
It's a question of the camera
reminding us--

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:22.000
demystifying our ideology,
in short--

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.349
reminding us that things as we
see them aren't necessarily the

00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:28.840
way things are.
 

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.639
The camera, too,
may have its bias.

00:47:31.639 --> 00:47:35.469
Slow motion is an obvious bias,
speed-up is an obvious bias;

00:47:35.469 --> 00:47:41.996
but the speed at which we see
things may be a bias,

00:47:41.996 --> 00:47:42.780
too.
 

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.550
It's not that the
psychoanalytic unconscious is

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:48.190
telling the truth.
 

00:47:48.190 --> 00:47:49.889
Dreams are crazy, right?
 

00:47:49.889 --> 00:47:50.789
&gt;
 

00:47:50.789 --> 00:47:52.119
That's the whole point of
dreams.

00:47:52.119 --> 00:47:57.106
It's not that it's reality over
against a mystified world seen

00:47:57.106 --> 00:47:58.659
in consciousness.
 

00:47:58.659 --> 00:48:01.994
It's a challenge to
consciousness by the world

00:48:01.994 --> 00:48:06.070
evoked in the unconscious,
not a question of what's real

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:07.849
and what isn't real.
 

00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:10.349
Well, it's the same with the
camera's-eye point of view,

00:48:10.349 --> 00:48:14.869
and it's all of this which,
in a certain sense,

00:48:14.869 --> 00:48:20.396
awakens the spectator from the
complacency of supposing his or

00:48:20.396 --> 00:48:23.840
her own perspective to be the
truth.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.755
At the same time,
admittedly the spectator is

00:48:26.755 --> 00:48:29.670
distracted--remember
Zerstreutheit.

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.119
Well, what then?
 

00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:35.809
The point is this:
there is a kind of dialectic

00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:40.501
between distraction and shock
which is crucial,

00:48:40.501 --> 00:48:44.376
Benjamin thinks,
to a genuine aesthetic

00:48:44.376 --> 00:48:46.110
revelation.
 

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:49.860
Perhaps the best analogy is
with Saul on the road to

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.670
Damascus.
 

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:53.927
You know how the story goes:
Saul is trotting along on his

00:48:53.927 --> 00:48:56.329
horse and not paying a lot of
attention.

00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:57.856
He's distracted,
daydreaming,

00:48:57.856 --> 00:48:59.219
whatever, and whhoooop!
 

00:48:59.219 --> 00:49:01.750
All of a sudden he falls off
his horse, right?

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.458
That's a shock,
and it's such a shock that he's

00:49:04.458 --> 00:49:07.817
converted to Christianity,
and he stands up and he brushes

00:49:07.817 --> 00:49:10.409
himself off and his name is
Paul, right?

00:49:10.409 --> 00:49:15.268
He's a completely different
person as a result.

00:49:15.268 --> 00:49:17.530
This couldn't have happened,
in other words,

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.159
if he hadn't been distracted.
 

00:49:19.159 --> 00:49:20.019
Right?
 

00:49:20.019 --> 00:49:22.110
That's Benjamin's point.
 

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:26.983
Distraction is the atmosphere
or medium in which the shock of

00:49:26.983 --> 00:49:31.289
revelation can take place,
and that's the advantage of

00:49:31.289 --> 00:49:32.590
distraction.
 

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:36.349
He gives a wonderful example of
the way in which we do receive

00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:40.233
works of art in distraction even
if we're the kind of person who

00:49:40.233 --> 00:49:43.869
does pay a lot of attention when
they go to the movies.

00:49:43.869 --> 00:49:46.329
"Oh, that's not me,"
we say.

00:49:46.329 --> 00:49:48.802
Nevertheless,
there is one way in which all

00:49:48.802 --> 00:49:51.864
of us receive works of art in a
state of distraction,

00:49:51.864 --> 00:49:54.690
and that's in our reception of
architecture.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.630
We pass through architecture.
 

00:49:57.630 --> 00:50:00.590
I work in the British Art
Center every day.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:03.952
I have long since ceased to pay
any attention to the British Art

00:50:03.952 --> 00:50:05.179
Center as a building.
 

00:50:05.179 --> 00:50:08.420
I receive the British Art
Center, in other words,

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:12.268
in a state of distraction,
but that doesn't mean that it's

00:50:12.268 --> 00:50:14.969
not part of my aesthetic
experience.

00:50:14.969 --> 00:50:19.831
It does, however,
show that the aesthetic and the

00:50:19.831 --> 00:50:25.201
ways in which we process the
forms of the world can be

00:50:25.201 --> 00:50:31.280
assimilated in more than one
kind of state of attention.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.994
It is in one's bones,
in a certain sense,

00:50:34.994 --> 00:50:38.967
to receive architecture;
and yet at the same time,

00:50:38.967 --> 00:50:42.833
unless we are sort of tourists
gaping in front of the Taj Mahal

00:50:42.833 --> 00:50:45.389
with a camera or something like
that--

00:50:45.389 --> 00:50:47.909
and Benjamin does take that
into account--

00:50:47.909 --> 00:50:51.190
unless we are in that
particular mode,

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:56.110
we receive the forms of our
dwellings in a state of what you

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:59.280
might call constructive
distraction.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.356
All of that goes into
Benjamin's aesthetic of

00:51:03.356 --> 00:51:04.840
participation.
 

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.929
Now I am out of time.
 

00:51:06.929 --> 00:51:10.760
Perhaps I have said just about
as much about Adorno as I need

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.681
to say,
although admittedly I haven't

00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:14.760
said much about the
"Culture Industry"

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.159
essay.
 

00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:19.682
Maybe I'll come back to that
briefly before launching into

00:51:19.682 --> 00:51:21.429
Jameson on Thursday.
 

00:51:21.429 --> 00:51:24.740
On Tuesday of next week,
we'll be talking about the New

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.599
Historicism.
 

00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:29.335
Then we'll bring Tony back and
we'll go through all of these

00:51:29.335 --> 00:51:33.134
various perspectives that we
will have been rehearsing to see

00:51:33.134 --> 00:51:36.300
what we can do with them when we
read Tony.

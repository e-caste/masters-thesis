00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.623
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, this week we're going

00:00:17.623 --> 00:00:22.800
to talk about biomechanics and
the reading is Chapter 10.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.057
I think on your syllabus it
says Chapter 10 and 13 but we're

00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:29.260
really only going to talk about
Chapter 10 during class.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.249
Then, our section on Thursday
will also involve two aspects of

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:35.251
biomechanics,
talking about materials

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.960
properties, which is what I'm
going to focus on in the lecture

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.016
today,
and thinking about some

00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:43.388
elementary gait analysis;
gait, G-A-I-T,

00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:50.023
or how humans walk and run and
the mechanics of that particular

00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:54.148
kind of motion.
This is like many of the

00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:57.682
other topics that we've covered
in the course,

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:00.271
a very big subject.
Some of you,

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.288
I have no doubt,
are going to go onto study

00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:08.000
biomechanics in greater detail.
I've picked a couple of things

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.768
that I thought were interesting
to sort of teach you sort of the

00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:18.125
elements of mechanics,
how do I use physics to think

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:24.578
about biological materials,
and how organisms live in a

00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:29.014
physical world.
Today we're going to talk about

00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:32.920
properties of biological
materials, and in particular,

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.090
two properties elasticity and
viscosity.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.284
We'll talk about how most real
biological materials,

00:01:40.284 --> 00:01:44.150
your skin, your brain,
the gel that makes up the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.250
interior portion of your eye
have both of those qualities.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.179
They're both viscous and
elastic, and they exhibit

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:54.629
something that we call
viscoelasticity.

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:57.696
By the end of the lecture
today you should a little bit

00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:00.922
about what viscoelasticity is
and how materials that have that

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:04.974
property behave,
and most biological materials

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:09.039
have that property.
Then on Thursday we're going to

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.748
talk about locomotion:
how do animals move,

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:14.069
in particular how do humans
move.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.590
We'll talk about three kinds of
motion.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.561
The most interesting one may be
flying that humans don't do

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:24.395
unaided but it's interesting to
think about how flight is

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:27.340
possible from a mechanical
perspective.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.926
How do organisms release
themselves from the

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:35.430
gravitational field and learn
how to move in flight?

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.321
We'll talk about swimming,
and we'll talk about running or

00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:44.922
walking.
First the mechanical

00:02:44.922 --> 00:02:48.113
properties of biological
materials and these are the two

00:02:48.113 --> 00:02:51.710
questions that I want to focus
on during the lecture today,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.851
and the two questions that you
should be able to answer by the

00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:56.810
end.
What is elasticity?

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.060
How would I measure elasticity?
How would I quantify elasticity?

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.509
There might be other ways to
think about that question,

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.585
and what is viscoelasticity?
How do viscoelastic materials

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:10.854
differ from elastic materials?
How does that make them

00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:16.889
different in biological--when
they're part of a biological

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.397
organism?
We're going to think about

00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:24.799
this simple experiment that's
shown schematically on the top

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.745
here in Panel A of this diagram.
We assume we have some

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:32.265
material, and this could be
anything, but let's think about

00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:36.722
it in the simplest possible way.
It's some uniform material,

00:03:36.722 --> 00:03:40.942
at least initially.
Maybe it's steel,

00:03:40.942 --> 00:03:44.900
maybe its rubber,
plastic;

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.368
maybe it's some biological
material like a muscle or some

00:03:49.368 --> 00:03:52.560
other kind of tissue,
skin, an artery.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.390
Let's just think about rubber
for the beginning,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.466
maybe even a rubber band.
You hang the rubber band from

00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:06.979
some solid support that's
unmovable like the ceiling here.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:10.008
So, we have some way of
affixing this solid material to

00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:13.710
the ceiling, and we can measure
some properties of the material,

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.229
mechanical properties of the
material.

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:17.852
For example,
it has a length and it has

00:04:17.852 --> 00:04:21.309
cross-sectional area.
When we do mechanical

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:25.123
testing we're trying to
understand how that material

00:04:25.123 --> 00:04:28.040
behaves when it's exposed to
forces,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.213
when it's exposed to forces it
encounters in the physical

00:04:32.213 --> 00:04:36.008
world.
We want to set up an experiment

00:04:36.008 --> 00:04:41.993
where we can apply a force
uniformly and measure the result

00:04:41.993 --> 00:04:46.019
of that force simply.
The experiment I show here is

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:49.172
just to hang a weight on that
material that's suspended from

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:51.629
the ceiling, that rubber band,
for example.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.751
I hang a weight on it,
and so that weight applies some

00:04:55.751 --> 00:05:00.495
force to the material because
gravity is going to pull it down

00:05:00.495 --> 00:05:03.449
with some force based on its
mass.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.850
For most materials,
certainly for rubber bands,

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.930
if I put them on the--affix
them to the ceiling that way and

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.070
attach the weight,
what would happen?

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.288
They would lengthen;
they'd get longer because

00:05:14.288 --> 00:05:18.816
they're exposed to that weight.
I've applied a force and

00:05:18.816 --> 00:05:24.510
I've experienced a deformation.
I've applied a force and the

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.163
material has deformed.
I'm going to quantify that,

00:05:28.163 --> 00:05:32.033
and I can quantify that fairly
easily because I chose a simple

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:35.650
material that had a constant
cross-sectional area from the

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.798
top to the bottom.
I'm going to assume that that

00:05:38.798 --> 00:05:41.768
cross-sectional area doesn't
change when it deforms,

00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:45.030
but I hang the weight on it and
the length increases.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.819
The length is now L + Î”L.
I can quantify the deformation

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:55.259
here by defining a property
called strain.

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.962
The strain is just the change
in length divided by the total

00:05:59.962 --> 00:06:03.099
length.
Now, important what length we

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.855
use here, and we're going to use
the initial length as the

00:06:07.855 --> 00:06:12.050
length.
So, the strain is the change in

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:18.230
length divided by the length in
the unstressed position,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.833
in the unstressed orientation,
unstressed condition,

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:27.579
that's the right word.
Does that make sense?

00:06:27.579 --> 00:06:30.632
This is a measure of how
much it deforms and we're going

00:06:30.632 --> 00:06:33.839
to define the stress and stress
is just force per unit area.

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:36.784
You can imagine if I hang the
same weight on this material,

00:06:36.784 --> 00:06:39.829
if it's as material that has a
large cross-sectional area,

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.634
it's very thick,
or it's a material that's very

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:46.171
thin, then its deformation is
going to be different because

00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:49.463
that force is going to be
distributed over either a big

00:06:49.463 --> 00:06:53.194
area or a small area.
So, the stress is just equal to

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:56.490
the force per area,
and we're going to assume that

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.660
we arranged it in some way that
it's uniform over the area.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.794
So the experiment makes sense?
Hang it from the ceiling,

00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:08.389
suspended, one end is held
rigid, I put a weight on it,

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:12.116
I watch it deform,
I measure the deformation that

00:07:12.116 --> 00:07:15.610
occurs as a result of applying
that stress.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.972
Now, to analyze how this
material behaves under different

00:07:20.972 --> 00:07:24.678
stress conditions.
So, I might want to know how

00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:28.311
does the muscle of my thigh
behave when it experiences

00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:32.878
different kinds of deformations.
What stress builds up when I

00:07:32.878 --> 00:07:34.968
stretch it out,
for example,

00:07:34.968 --> 00:07:39.149
because I'm interested in the
mechanics of running.

00:07:39.149 --> 00:07:42.444
What I want to know is,
"What is the deformation that

00:07:42.444 --> 00:07:46.183
occurs in this particular muscle
when I've applied different

00:07:46.183 --> 00:07:48.779
forces,
or different stresses to it?"

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:52.149
The way that I would measure
that is by just applying

00:07:52.149 --> 00:07:54.836
different forces.
Start with a small force,

00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:57.050
add a larger force,
add a larger force,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:59.847
and then measure the
deformation at each of those

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:02.856
conditions.
If I did that I could plot,

00:08:02.856 --> 00:08:06.240
on this diagram here,
stress versus strain.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.988
Now, the strain,
remember, just Î”L/L,

00:08:11.988 --> 00:08:14.540
the stress just the force
divided by the area.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.479
I would get different points on
this curve and each one would

00:08:18.479 --> 00:08:22.616
represent a different experiment
where I added a different force

00:08:22.616 --> 00:08:25.899
and eventually I could draw a
line through it.

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:28.722
Now, think back again to
the first example I said,

00:08:28.722 --> 00:08:30.959
this simple example,
just a rubber band.

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:32.837
If you did this experiment with
a rubber band,

00:08:32.837 --> 00:08:35.090
you hung different forces on
it, what would you see?

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.546
As you put more weight on,
the rubber band would stretch

00:08:39.546 --> 00:08:43.192
more and more,
and more so the strain would go

00:08:43.192 --> 00:08:46.516
up.
In fact, up to a certain amount

00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:51.763
of force, if I measured the
strain that results from forces,

00:08:51.763 --> 00:08:56.202
I would get a straight line.
I could plot stress versus

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.789
strain and I would get a
straight line.

00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:04.536
That--a material that behaves
that way is called an elastic

00:09:04.536 --> 00:09:08.399
material, that's an elastic
material.

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:11.709
A perfect elastic material,
I could apply those forces,

00:09:11.709 --> 00:09:14.773
it would stretch out,
and if I took the forces away

00:09:14.773 --> 00:09:18.855
it would go right back up again.
At the end of the experiment of

00:09:18.855 --> 00:09:21.639
adding more weight,
then taking the weight off,

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:25.269
the material would be exactly
the same as how it started.

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:28.679
That's an elastic material
that's perfectly reversible,

00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:31.963
a perfect elastic material.
Now, I could tell you

00:09:31.963 --> 00:09:35.334
everything you need to know
about the elastic properties of

00:09:35.334 --> 00:09:39.169
that material by giving you one
number, the slope of this line.

00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:41.922
Because once you knew the slope
of this line,

00:09:41.922 --> 00:09:45.488
you could draw the curve that
represents all of its stress

00:09:45.488 --> 00:09:48.169
strain behavior.
Instead of someone else having

00:09:48.169 --> 00:09:50.789
to do this experiment again,
you could just tell them,

00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:55.820
"Oh for those rubber bands I
measured the elasticity and the

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.679
elasticity or the slope of this
line is some number E."

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:06.027
This letter "E" is called the
elastic modulus or the Young's

00:10:06.027 --> 00:10:10.740
modulus and it's a
characteristic of the material.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.604
For this material in this
particular geometry,

00:10:13.604 --> 00:10:17.150
that's the elastic modulus.
Someone who knew that would

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.985
know how to predict how that
material behaves,

00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:24.080
at least under the conditions
in which you did the experiment.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:26.825
Does that make sense?
Now, if you've studied

00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:29.272
physics in the past,
I assume most of you have in

00:10:29.272 --> 00:10:32.740
high school, then you've thought
about perfect elastic materials.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:38.870
What did you call a perfect
elastic material in physics?

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:44.278
Anybody remember studying a
perfect elastic material in

00:10:44.278 --> 00:10:47.044
physics?
A spring, that's exactly what a

00:10:47.044 --> 00:10:49.333
spring is.
When you talked about springs,

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:52.162
you talked about a spring
constant, which was how to

00:10:52.162 --> 00:10:54.269
relate the force to the
elongation.

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:57.042
This is exactly the same thing
but it's sort of described in a

00:10:57.042 --> 00:10:59.814
different way because now you're
talking about a real material

00:10:59.814 --> 00:11:03.779
that has cross-sectional area,
not an imaginary spring.

00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:07.002
When you thought about springs
and spring constants,

00:11:07.002 --> 00:11:10.730
you were thinking about this
exact same physical process.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.610
We're just describing it in a
different way now.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:16.729
In fact, by the end of the
lecture we'll come back to

00:11:16.729 --> 00:11:21.323
thinking about springs as a way
of idealizing or describing

00:11:21.323 --> 00:11:24.730
materials that have complex
properties.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.753
The spring,
the imaginary object that you

00:11:27.753 --> 00:11:31.463
talked about in physics is just
an idealization of real

00:11:31.463 --> 00:11:35.518
materials and how they really
behave when forces are applied

00:11:35.518 --> 00:11:38.761
to them.
If you continue to add force,

00:11:38.761 --> 00:11:42.853
then at some point the
material's not going to behave

00:11:42.853 --> 00:11:47.213
perfectly elastically anymore.
You'll see that because it's

00:11:47.213 --> 00:11:50.110
not a straight line anymore,
it's not linear.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:53.251
It still might be elastic but
it's not linearly elastic so you

00:11:53.251 --> 00:11:55.620
can't describe it by just the
slope anymore.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.992
At some point,
for any material,

00:11:57.992 --> 00:12:01.820
you could enough weight that
it's going to fail.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.137
You could define the stress at
failure, when the material

00:12:06.137 --> 00:12:09.619
physically breaks,
or the strain at failure when

00:12:09.619 --> 00:12:13.230
it physically doesn't function
as a material anymore;

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.600
for the rubber band you add so
much force that it breaks.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:21.317
There's some weird behavior
that starts to happen when it's

00:12:21.317 --> 00:12:23.980
in that mode of starting to
fail,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.866
in that some of the assumptions
that we made don't hold any

00:12:27.866 --> 00:12:29.084
longer.
For example,

00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:31.800
the assumption that the
cross-sectional area stays the

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.696
same.
If you stretch out a rubber

00:12:33.696 --> 00:12:36.888
band, if you stretch it so,
so, so much the cross-sectional

00:12:36.888 --> 00:12:39.639
area is going to start to cave
in at one point,

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:43.039
not along the whole rubber band
but at some point.

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:48.569
So, it doesn't even behave in
the way that stress continuously

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:53.736
goes up with strain anymore,
and that's because of the way

00:12:53.736 --> 00:12:57.156
we've defined it.
The simple experiment makes

00:12:57.156 --> 00:12:58.642
sense.
Let's imagine,

00:12:58.642 --> 00:13:02.104
then, that we're doing this
experiment where we've got the

00:13:02.104 --> 00:13:04.289
material attached to the
ceiling.

00:13:04.289 --> 00:13:07.737
It's a rubber band,
still, and we're adding weight

00:13:07.737 --> 00:13:10.023
to it.
One way to think about that is

00:13:10.023 --> 00:13:13.126
that we're going the point zero,
the totally unstressed

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.539
material, and we're adding more
weight.

00:13:15.539 --> 00:13:19.471
We're going up towards Point A
here, and so we're moving

00:13:19.471 --> 00:13:23.831
towards Point A by adding more
weight to the material and it's

00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:26.399
stretching out.
As we're adding more weight,

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:30.371
we're applying more stress;
we're experiencing or observing

00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:33.477
more strain.
If you go up to Point A,

00:13:33.477 --> 00:13:38.507
I can come back down from Point
A by taking the weights off and

00:13:38.507 --> 00:13:43.375
the material will follow exactly
the same path back along the

00:13:43.375 --> 00:13:47.366
same stress strain curve.
I could stretch the material,

00:13:47.366 --> 00:13:49.997
I could return the material to
its original state,

00:13:49.997 --> 00:13:52.306
I could stretch it,
I could return it to its

00:13:52.306 --> 00:13:55.569
original state.
That's a reversible elastic

00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:58.317
material.
At the beginning it has one

00:13:58.317 --> 00:14:02.480
property, you stretch it out,
you let it come back and it's

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.279
the same as it was at the
beginning.

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:07.269
That's a perfectly elastic
material.

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:10.124
If you overstretch a
material, that is,

00:14:10.124 --> 00:14:14.134
you go instead of Point B you
add so much weight--instead of

00:14:14.134 --> 00:14:18.279
Point A you add so much weight
that you go up to Point B.

00:14:18.279 --> 00:14:22.014
When you take the weight off it
might now follow the same stress

00:14:22.014 --> 00:14:24.090
strain behavior coming back
down.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.889
In this case,
it follows this different

00:14:26.889 --> 00:14:30.850
curve, the dotted line here.
Now, what does that mean?

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:34.087
What would you really have
observed when you did this

00:14:34.087 --> 00:14:37.200
experiment that ended up being
plotted this way?

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.828
I was adding weight,
I was stretching out the

00:14:39.828 --> 00:14:43.593
material, and I stretched it so
much that I actually changed the

00:14:43.593 --> 00:14:46.409
material.
It can't go back to its

00:14:46.409 --> 00:14:51.198
original shape anymore,
but when I take the weight off,

00:14:51.198 --> 00:14:56.060
it's permanently deformed.
When I take the weight off it

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:01.035
follows this line back and even
at zero stress it still has some

00:15:01.035 --> 00:15:04.099
deformation,
meaning it's longer than it was

00:15:04.099 --> 00:15:06.924
when I started.
You've had this experience with

00:15:06.924 --> 00:15:09.732
rubber bands or balloons.
If you play with it enough,

00:15:09.732 --> 00:15:11.124
you stretch it,
you stretch it,

00:15:11.124 --> 00:15:13.630
you really stretch it and now
it doesn't go back to its

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:16.139
original shape anymore,
and if you look at the rubber

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:17.639
band it physically looks
different.

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:20.539
There might be a part that's
narrower or the texture of it

00:15:20.539 --> 00:15:23.490
looks different because it's
stretched in one direction.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:28.058
You physically deformed the
material beyond its elastic

00:15:28.058 --> 00:15:33.100
limit, and you've created what's
called a plastic deformation.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.559
You've changed the material so
it's not the same anymore.

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:42.802
That's going beyond the elastic
limit, which in this case might

00:15:42.802 --> 00:15:46.840
be A, and you've created not
just an elastic deformation but

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.080
a plastic deformation.
That material's now forever

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.487
changed.
Maybe there some ways that you

00:15:53.487 --> 00:15:55.340
can get it back,
but probably not.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.769
It's like--does anybody have a
Slinky?

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:02.228
That's a 60's toy,
you didn't play with Slinky's

00:16:02.228 --> 00:16:05.460
but maybe you had.
They used to wire and you could

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.583
cut yourself on them and now
they're plastic but they're

00:16:08.583 --> 00:16:11.650
these--I need a nod that
somebody else besides me knows

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.257
what a Slinky is.
You're supposed to be able to

00:16:14.257 --> 00:16:17.159
make it walk down the stairs but
it doesn't ever really work.

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:19.487
If you take a Slinky you can
stretch it out and it'll go

00:16:19.487 --> 00:16:21.179
back, stretch it out and it goes
back,

00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:23.510
but what if you have your
brother or your sister grab it

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.289
and you pull it all the across
the room.

00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:29.960
The material gets physically
deformed, it doesn't go back any

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.929
longer, that's a plastic
deformation of a Slinky.

00:16:33.929 --> 00:16:37.817
Phone cords the same way,
so you have a lot of experience

00:16:37.817 --> 00:16:41.522
with this in your real life.
You've used a phone that has a

00:16:41.522 --> 00:16:45.429
wire on it, right?
Coil--If we're just talking

00:16:45.429 --> 00:16:50.445
about elastic materials,
that means materials that have

00:16:50.445 --> 00:16:55.647
the property of elasticity and
they haven't been deformed

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:59.665
beyond their elastic limit,
then I can stretch them,

00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:01.015
they'll come back,
stretch them,

00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:03.629
come back, and I can do that as
many times as I want and I'll

00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:07.987
always get the same material.
You could classify materials

00:17:07.987 --> 00:17:12.509
that are elastic into different
properties.

00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:15.672
Now, we're not just thinking
about rubber bands but we're

00:17:15.672 --> 00:17:19.501
thinking about every material.
Most materials have some

00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:24.217
elasticity and over a certain
range of stresses they will

00:17:24.217 --> 00:17:27.440
deform elastically.
Steel deforms elastically,

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.390
you don't think about it doing
that.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.473
You've got to apply really high
stresses in order for it to

00:17:32.473 --> 00:17:34.599
deform but it does deform
elastically.

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:37.890
Wood does under some
conditions, bones do;

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.650
all materials do under at least
some range of stress conditions.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:46.603
Some are going to be what's
called more compliant,

00:17:46.603 --> 00:17:50.408
that is they're--at a given
stress, at a given force

00:17:50.408 --> 00:17:54.298
application they deform more.
That's a compliant material,

00:17:54.298 --> 00:17:56.440
one that's very stretchy or
very elastic.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:00.619
Or stiff, one that doesn't
deform very much when a stress

00:18:00.619 --> 00:18:04.649
is applied, that's a stiffer
material, a less compliant

00:18:04.649 --> 00:18:08.264
material.
Or brittle, that is deforms

00:18:08.264 --> 00:18:13.750
even less and will break rather
than stretch very much.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:18.881
You could define different
classes of materials based on

00:18:18.881 --> 00:18:23.136
this property of elasticity.
That's one part of what I

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:26.200
wanted you to understand today,
'What's an elastic material,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.523
how would I characterize it,
and what does it mean to be an

00:18:29.523 --> 00:18:32.404
elastic material?'
The second thing I want to

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:36.407
think about is viscosity.
Viscosity is a property that we

00:18:36.407 --> 00:18:40.712
associate with fluids.
We've talked about viscosity,

00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:45.504
we talked about the viscosity
of blood flowing through

00:18:45.504 --> 00:18:47.472
arteries,
for example,

00:18:47.472 --> 00:18:51.960
and how viscosity contributed
to the resistance of a vessel.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.450
It's in that relationship
between pressure drop and flow.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:19:01.953
Well, let's think about another
experiment where we have a fluid

00:19:01.953 --> 00:19:05.359
and we want to measure its
viscosity.

00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:09.273
That is, we want to measure
what's its resistance to flow of

00:19:09.273 --> 00:19:10.968
the fluid?
A way to do that

00:19:10.968 --> 00:19:13.261
experiment, and it turns out
that there's a lot more

00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:16.231
practical ways than this,
but here's one way to do the

00:19:16.231 --> 00:19:18.860
experiment is to take a table
like this one,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.162
a solid surface that's not
going to move and spread the

00:19:22.162 --> 00:19:25.642
liquid all over the surface.
Now, let's forget for a minute

00:19:25.642 --> 00:19:28.568
about the fact that this table
is only so wide and so fluid's

00:19:28.568 --> 00:19:31.932
going to flow off the edges,
and let's assume that I could

00:19:31.932 --> 00:19:35.000
put a layer of fluid on here and
it would stay.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.221
Then, I could put another
desktop on top of it,

00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:44.269
so what I've created is a space
between two desktops,

00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:48.392
one of which is fixed to the
floor so it won't move and the

00:19:48.392 --> 00:19:52.160
other which is floating on top
of a layer of fluid.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.576
Does this make sense?
So, now you could imagine

00:19:55.576 --> 00:19:57.755
if you could that,
if I had a layer of fluid here

00:19:57.755 --> 00:19:59.480
and another desktop sitting on
top,

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.815
I could apply a force this way
parallel to the surface and the

00:20:04.815 --> 00:20:09.004
thing would move easily.
If it was water it would move

00:20:09.004 --> 00:20:12.899
very easily, if it was alcohol
the fluid, it would move very

00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:16.134
easily.
If it was molasses it would

00:20:16.134 --> 00:20:21.569
move but I'd have to apply more
force in order to move the

00:20:21.569 --> 00:20:25.859
desktop on the surface,
but I could do it.

00:20:25.859 --> 00:20:29.158
What you're really doing in
that experiment I just described

00:20:29.158 --> 00:20:32.177
is the same thing as the
experiment we did when we hung

00:20:32.177 --> 00:20:35.140
the rubber band from the top of
the ceiling here,

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:39.950
is that I've applied a force
and I've measured a deformation.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.700
Now, the force and the
deformation are different in

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.200
this case because now I'm
applying a force not in tension,

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.237
before I was talking about only
applying forces in tension to

00:20:53.237 --> 00:20:56.680
create a tension force in the
material.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.559
Now, I'm applying a force in
shear.

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:04.718
I'm trying to move one plate
relative to another plate and

00:21:04.718 --> 00:21:08.950
I'm trying to move them across
each other so that's a shear

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.229
force.
The deformation is not a

00:21:12.229 --> 00:21:17.966
deformation like it increases in
length, the deformation is that

00:21:17.966 --> 00:21:22.609
the wall on top moves and it
moves continuously.

00:21:22.609 --> 00:21:26.331
Imagine if I start to apply--I
have this setup here,

00:21:26.331 --> 00:21:29.470
the desktop is on top of the
layer fluid,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:35.111
on top of the desktop below,
and I somehow apply a constant

00:21:35.111 --> 00:21:38.831
force to that top plate,
that top desktop,

00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:42.967
it's going to continue to move
as long as I apply a constant

00:21:42.967 --> 00:21:46.332
force it'll move,
it'll move, it'll move,

00:21:46.332 --> 00:21:49.660
eventually I'd fall off the
desk here.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:57.259
What's created is not a strain,
what's created is a velocity.

00:21:57.259 --> 00:22:02.830
The top plate is going to move,
and if I apply a constant

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:09.097
force, a constant shearing force
to the top plate I will measure

00:22:09.097 --> 00:22:13.359
a velocity.
Does that make sense?

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:19.087
What's really happening in
the fluid here is that within

00:22:19.087 --> 00:22:24.329
this fluid, when I apply the
force on the top plate,

00:22:24.329 --> 00:22:27.907
the molecules of fluid that are
right next to the top--let me

00:22:27.907 --> 00:22:31.723
call it a plate now instead of a
desktop because that's a shorter

00:22:31.723 --> 00:22:33.618
word,
that molecules of fluid that

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:36.480
are right next to this top
plate, when I start to move it,

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.309
they move along with the top
plate.

00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:42.341
Those molecules of fluid
experience some friction with

00:22:42.341 --> 00:22:44.800
the top plate,
and when I move the top plate

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.500
they move along with.
The molecules of fluid that are

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.089
just below that also want to
move along with it,

00:22:52.089 --> 00:22:56.604
because there's some friction
between the molecules inside the

00:22:56.604 --> 00:22:59.805
liquid.
There's some friction but it's

00:22:59.805 --> 00:23:02.509
not perfect friction,
it slips.

00:23:02.509 --> 00:23:08.250
Viscosity is a measure of how
slippy the fluid is;

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:12.360
different layers of fluid,
how easily they slide by one

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.923
another when they're sheared.
Water, because it has a low

00:23:16.923 --> 00:23:21.402
viscosity, compared to molasses,
those layers of water are going

00:23:21.402 --> 00:23:24.690
to move easily over one another,
whereas in molasses,

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:27.130
there's more friction between
the layers and so it's harder to

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:27.450
move.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.996
In either case,
what will happen is that when I

00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:36.633
apply the force,
the packets of fluid up near

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:39.930
the top are going to move along
with the top plate,

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.368
the ones a little below it are
going to move a little slower,

00:23:42.368 --> 00:23:44.970
the ones below it are going to
move a little slower than that,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.995
slower than that,
slower than that,

00:23:46.995 --> 00:23:50.748
slower than that until the ones
at the very bottom don't move at

00:23:50.748 --> 00:23:54.799
all because they're experiencing
friction from the bottom plate.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:58.402
If I could look microscopically
at what happens when I shear

00:23:58.402 --> 00:24:02.127
this top plate over the bottom
plate within the layer of fluid

00:24:02.127 --> 00:24:04.702
between,
I've created a velocity

00:24:04.702 --> 00:24:09.188
gradient where the fluid is
moving very fast near the top

00:24:09.188 --> 00:24:11.712
plate,
slower in the middle,

00:24:11.712 --> 00:24:16.089
and not at all at the surface
of the bottom plate.

00:24:16.089 --> 00:24:21.493
By doing this I can measure the
force that's required in order

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:24.859
to establish that velocity
gradient.

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:29.878
I'm going to make the same
kind of plot here that I made in

00:24:29.878 --> 00:24:33.439
stress versus strain for an
elastic material,

00:24:33.439 --> 00:24:36.920
but I'm going to plot different
things.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.589
Instead of stress--tensile
stress I'm going to plot shear

00:24:41.589 --> 00:24:46.508
stress, and that is the amount
of force that I've applied on

00:24:46.508 --> 00:24:50.678
this wall in order to get it to
move divided by the

00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:53.930
cross-sectional area of the
wall.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.349
It's the amount of force I had
to apply in order to set this

00:24:57.349 --> 00:25:01.000
thing in constant motion divided
by its cross-sectional area.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.029
What I'm going to plot down
here is the rate of deformation.

00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:10.247
Because there is no limit to
the deformation here,

00:25:10.247 --> 00:25:15.670
as long as I apply the force
it's going to continue to slide.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.043
I can't measure the strain
because it will continuously

00:25:19.043 --> 00:25:22.409
deform, there's no end to it.
What I can measure,

00:25:22.409 --> 00:25:25.871
instead, is the maximum
velocity divided by the

00:25:25.871 --> 00:25:30.462
thickness, the gap between the
two walls, or the height of the

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:35.500
fluid.
This velocity divided by height

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:41.070
is a measure of the rate of
deformation.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:46.430
Does that make sense?
Kind of the same thing;

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:49.000
I did an experiment set up a
different way,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.569
applied a force,
measured a deformation.

00:25:51.569 --> 00:25:54.130
In this case,
shear stress and rate of

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.498
deformation.
What I'd find here is that over

00:25:57.498 --> 00:26:01.211
a certain length--over a certain
range of forces,

00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:05.380
I would get a straight line.
The slope of that line is this

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.854
property called the viscosity.
For fluids that have a high

00:26:09.854 --> 00:26:15.438
viscosity like molasses or
honey, I have to apply a lot of

00:26:15.438 --> 00:26:20.140
force in order to achieve a
certain velocity.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:22.779
For fluids that are less
viscous, like water,

00:26:22.779 --> 00:26:26.259
I don't need to apply so much
force in order to change that

00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:30.470
same velocity,
in order to achieve that same

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:33.230
velocity.
Does this make sense?

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.589
Here's another kind of
material, and there are

00:26:35.589 --> 00:26:38.525
biological materials that behave
this way, their mechanics are

00:26:38.525 --> 00:26:40.560
like this;
blood is one of them.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.195
Blood is a viscous material.
If I put blood between this

00:26:44.195 --> 00:26:48.443
here and I did this experiment,
I would see roughly this

00:26:48.443 --> 00:26:51.215
behavior.
As I increase the force I

00:26:51.215 --> 00:26:54.834
increase the velocity,
and it's linear and I could

00:26:54.834 --> 00:26:58.972
measure the viscosity.
Now, it turns out that blood is

00:26:58.972 --> 00:27:02.521
a little bit different,
in that it turns out that

00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:07.254
unlike water if I apply even the
smallest force the plate's going

00:27:07.254 --> 00:27:10.359
to move when it's water between
here.

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:13.369
If it was blood,
it turns out that for small

00:27:13.369 --> 00:27:17.569
forces it doesn't move at all,
that I have to apply a certain

00:27:17.569 --> 00:27:20.859
amount of force in order to get
it to move.

00:27:20.859 --> 00:27:25.262
Why do you think it would
be different for blood than for

00:27:25.262 --> 00:27:27.387
water?
What can you imagine that's

00:27:27.387 --> 00:27:30.748
different for blood that creates
this situation that at very

00:27:30.748 --> 00:27:32.970
small forces it doesn't move at
all,

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:38.029
but it has some yield force or
yield stress that one has to get

00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:41.130
over in order to start it in
motion.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.500
What's different about blood
than water?

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.025
It's thicker than water,
you know that from the Bible,

00:27:49.025 --> 00:27:52.285
isn't that right?
Blood is thicker than water,

00:27:52.285 --> 00:27:54.573
I don't even know.
Justin?Student:

00:27:54.573 --> 00:27:56.546
Large molecules in red blood
cells.Professor Mark

00:27:56.546 --> 00:27:58.700
Saltzman: It has large
molecules and red blood cells,

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:02.242
and has red blood cells at a
fairly high volume fraction,

00:28:02.242 --> 00:28:05.761
about 50% is blood cells.
It turns out that to get those

00:28:05.761 --> 00:28:08.780
blood cells rolling,
to get them moving out of each

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:11.799
other's way requires a certain
amount of force.

00:28:11.799 --> 00:28:14.831
In fact, when blood is
stagnant, even if it's

00:28:14.831 --> 00:28:17.863
anti-coagulated,
the blood cells tend to form

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:21.240
structures where they align with
one another,

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.180
and so it's hard to get that
moving.

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:30.257
For most of its--for most of
the shear stresses that are

00:28:30.257 --> 00:28:35.190
biologically important,
blood behaves as a viscous

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.529
liquid, it's about three times
as viscous as water.

00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:45.867
So that's viscosity,
so you know about elasticity

00:28:45.867 --> 00:28:50.008
and viscosity.
Let's go back now to the

00:28:50.008 --> 00:28:54.355
material I talked about at the
beginning and let's assume now

00:28:54.355 --> 00:28:58.629
that it's not a perfect elastic
material but it's a material

00:28:58.629 --> 00:29:03.528
that is different than that.
Let's do the experiment in a

00:29:03.528 --> 00:29:07.829
different way or look at it in a
different way,

00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:10.999
where I'm still hanging the
material from the ceiling and

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:12.980
I'm still applying a force to
it,

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.787
and I'm asking how it deforms.
Now instead of just looking at

00:29:16.787 --> 00:29:20.474
its total deformation I want to
look at how the deformation

00:29:20.474 --> 00:29:24.144
changes over time.
Time is an important variable

00:29:24.144 --> 00:29:28.013
in most biological processes.
You care not only about how

00:29:28.013 --> 00:29:30.327
much deformation I get when I
apply a force,

00:29:30.327 --> 00:29:33.609
but you care about how quickly
I achieve that deformation,

00:29:33.609 --> 00:29:38.332
and how quickly materials can
physically move when forces are

00:29:38.332 --> 00:29:40.311
applied.
If this is a perfect

00:29:40.311 --> 00:29:43.190
elastic material like a rubber
band or like the springs you

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.395
learned about in physics,
when I apply a force here,

00:29:46.395 --> 00:29:49.120
it instantaneously changes its
length.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.240
Deformations are instantaneous;
they take no time at all for a

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.601
perfect elastic material.
How much would the deformation

00:29:55.601 --> 00:29:57.430
occur?
Well it would depend on the

00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.461
elasticity, but as soon as I
added that force it's going to

00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:03.335
stretch out--bang--to that
length and it's going to stay

00:30:03.335 --> 00:30:05.486
there.
You know real materials don't

00:30:05.486 --> 00:30:08.529
behave like this but our prefect
elastic material does.

00:30:08.529 --> 00:30:11.086
If the material is
viscoelastic,

00:30:11.086 --> 00:30:15.787
meaning it has properties of
both elasticity and viscosity

00:30:15.787 --> 00:30:19.085
like a muscle,
say, like the fluid that's

00:30:19.085 --> 00:30:23.278
inside your eye.
If I apply a force it's going

00:30:23.278 --> 00:30:26.230
to exhibit two different
behaviors.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.147
First it's going to elongate
instantaneously just like the

00:30:30.147 --> 00:30:34.339
perfect elastic material would
and then it's going to continue

00:30:34.339 --> 00:30:37.777
to elongate slowly.
It's going to continue to

00:30:37.777 --> 00:30:40.056
elongate.
I've shown that here,

00:30:40.056 --> 00:30:43.569
if I look at the length versus
time it's going to

00:30:43.569 --> 00:30:48.034
instantaneously elongate to some
extent and then it's going to

00:30:48.034 --> 00:30:51.654
slowly keep deforming.
Now, that behavior,

00:30:51.654 --> 00:30:55.942
where I apply a force and it
goes initially out to here looks

00:30:55.942 --> 00:30:58.978
like elastic material;
the behavior where it

00:30:58.978 --> 00:31:02.665
continually starts--continues to
stretch out over time and gets

00:31:02.665 --> 00:31:05.685
longer,
and longer, and longer that

00:31:05.685 --> 00:31:10.423
looks like a viscous material.
That's how a viscous material

00:31:10.423 --> 00:31:12.782
would behave,
I apply a force and it

00:31:12.782 --> 00:31:15.410
continuously deforms with some
rate.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.703
This material is behaving like
an elastic solid and like a

00:31:20.703 --> 00:31:22.839
viscous liquid,
both.

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:25.166
It's what we call a
viscoelastic material,

00:31:25.166 --> 00:31:28.059
and most biological materials
have that property.

00:31:28.059 --> 00:31:31.498
They have some viscosity that
is they deform continuously

00:31:31.498 --> 00:31:34.869
under stress.
They have some elasticity,

00:31:34.869 --> 00:31:38.450
they deform elastically under
stress.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:42.978
Another way to do this
experiment would be not to hang

00:31:42.978 --> 00:31:47.109
a weight and then measure what
deformation occurs,

00:31:47.109 --> 00:31:50.677
but to instead do the
experiment as is shown in this

00:31:50.677 --> 00:31:53.614
diagram here,
which is stretch the material

00:31:53.614 --> 00:31:57.601
out suddenly and then measure
the force that's required to

00:31:57.601 --> 00:32:00.603
hold this apart.
For an elastic material,

00:32:00.603 --> 00:32:04.127
you'd get the same result.
If you apply a strain,

00:32:04.127 --> 00:32:09.416
that is, I just pull this up to
some length, it's going to take

00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:13.096
some force to do that.
All the force gets applied

00:32:13.096 --> 00:32:16.666
instantaneously and then after
that I just maintain the force

00:32:16.666 --> 00:32:20.308
and I hold the material there.
For a viscoelastic material it

00:32:20.308 --> 00:32:22.993
behaves differently,
in that its initial response

00:32:22.993 --> 00:32:26.916
will be like an elastic solid.
It will--you stretch it out to

00:32:26.916 --> 00:32:30.930
its strain and it's going to
take the same force to open it

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.630
up, to stretch it out,
to deform it.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:38.293
Then, the materials going to
relax and start to flow which

00:32:38.293 --> 00:32:43.447
would--what you would measure is
that the force required to hold

00:32:43.447 --> 00:32:48.519
it at this deformation starts to
drop over time as the material

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:53.755
itself rearranges and deforms in
order to accommodate that strain

00:32:53.755 --> 00:32:57.390
that you've put in it.
Does that make sense?

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.144
Two ways to do the
experiment, two different ways

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:03.580
of looking at viscoelasticity.
One is you apply a force and

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.061
now you can see continuous
deformation, the other is that

00:33:07.061 --> 00:33:10.853
you apply a deformation and you
see a change in force required

00:33:10.853 --> 00:33:13.340
to hold that deformation over
time.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:21.423
It turns out that not all
viscoelastic materials exhibit

00:33:21.423 --> 00:33:24.905
the same behavior but there's a
range of viscoelastic

00:33:24.905 --> 00:33:28.811
properties.
Some viscoelastic materials

00:33:28.811 --> 00:33:35.365
behave more like elastic solids,
some behave more like viscous

00:33:35.365 --> 00:33:40.630
liquids, and some behave
somewhere in between.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:45.069
Physicists have figured out
ways, models that they can use

00:33:45.069 --> 00:33:48.339
to explain how viscous materials
behave.

00:33:48.339 --> 00:33:51.354
You could imagine that this
would be important in biomedical

00:33:51.354 --> 00:33:53.005
engineering.
For example,

00:33:53.005 --> 00:33:57.607
if I want to understand how the
leg works, then an important

00:33:57.607 --> 00:34:02.130
part of how the leg works as a
machine is understanding the

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:08.069
properties of the leg muscles.
How they deform under stress

00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:12.882
and how, when stresses are
applied to them,

00:34:12.882 --> 00:34:18.305
how that changes their shape.
That's essential for if a

00:34:18.305 --> 00:34:22.449
muscle is going to contract and
apply a force to your leg,

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:26.896
then you need to know how the
strain or deformation of that

00:34:26.896 --> 00:34:30.730
muscle relates to its ability to
create a force,

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.420
to pick up the leg for example,
or to move it.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:40.239
I'd like some way to
describe that mathematically.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:44.748
I'd like some way to describe
the stress strain behavior of

00:34:44.748 --> 00:34:48.480
complicated biological materials
like muscles.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.467
One way to do that is to build
models based on elements that I

00:34:53.467 --> 00:34:58.019
understand.
So, I understand the spring.

00:34:58.019 --> 00:35:01.321
I understand the spring and if
it was a perfect--if the muscle

00:35:01.321 --> 00:35:04.406
was a perfect elastic material I
could describe all of its

00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:07.599
behavior by its spring constant
or its elastic modulus.

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:10.736
I would know everything about
its stress-strain behavior,

00:35:10.736 --> 00:35:14.041
but muscles don't behave like
strings because they have some

00:35:14.041 --> 00:35:18.228
viscous properties.
What's a simple example of

00:35:18.228 --> 00:35:22.565
a viscous material?
Well, I gave you this example

00:35:22.565 --> 00:35:26.380
of the plate sliding over the
layer of fluid.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:30.270
Well, there's another model
that physicist's use to describe

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:33.369
viscous materials and maybe
you've seen this,

00:35:33.369 --> 00:35:35.949
it's an element that you don't
really encounter in life.

00:35:35.949 --> 00:35:38.718
You encounter things like
springs, but you don't encounter

00:35:38.718 --> 00:35:41.830
things like dashpots very often.
That's what this is called;

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:45.849
this is a dashpot.
A dashpot is an idealized

00:35:45.849 --> 00:35:49.420
physical model of a viscous
liquid.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.339
One way to imagine it is that
it's a cylinder,

00:35:53.339 --> 00:35:58.130
the black cylinder here,
inside of a hollow cylinder.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:03.200
So, it's a cylinder inside of a
hollow cylinder and there's some

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.869
friction between the outside
wall of the black cylinder and

00:36:07.869 --> 00:36:11.329
the inside wall of the hollow
cylinder.

00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:16.091
There's some well-behaved,
well-known friction between the

00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:20.853
inside of the hollow cylinder
and the outside of the inner

00:36:20.853 --> 00:36:23.509
cylinder.
Now--then if I apply a

00:36:23.509 --> 00:36:26.828
force, apply a force down here
in that direction to this

00:36:26.828 --> 00:36:31.017
dashpot what's going to happen?
The inner cylinder is going to

00:36:31.017 --> 00:36:34.794
slide over the outer cylinder,
slide through the outer

00:36:34.794 --> 00:36:37.258
cylinder.
For a constant force,

00:36:37.258 --> 00:36:40.399
since this is a
well-behaved--the friction

00:36:40.399 --> 00:36:44.000
between here is well-known and
well-behaved,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.417
it's going to just slide with a
uniform velocity the inner

00:36:48.417 --> 00:36:51.130
cylinder over the outer
cylinder.

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:54.004
Does that make sense?
So, this dashpot is an

00:36:54.004 --> 00:36:58.119
idealized physical model for how
a viscous liquid behaves.

00:36:58.119 --> 00:37:03.059
I apply a force and it
continuously deforms.

00:37:03.059 --> 00:37:05.814
Now, it's better as a thought
experiment than a real

00:37:05.814 --> 00:37:08.623
experiment because you can
imagine making things that

00:37:08.623 --> 00:37:11.673
behave like real springs.
Real dashpots would be hard to

00:37:11.673 --> 00:37:12.730
make.
Why?

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.311
Because eventually no matter
how long your outer cylinder

00:37:15.311 --> 00:37:17.110
was, you'd eventually come out
of it.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.543
A real dashpot,
if it's going to deform for a

00:37:19.543 --> 00:37:22.530
long time, would have to be
infinitely long as well,

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.326
so it's better as a thought
experiment than a real thing to

00:37:25.326 --> 00:37:27.400
build but you get the thought
experiment,

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.776
right?
I have a spring here,

00:37:29.776 --> 00:37:31.719
how will it behave when I force
on it?

00:37:31.719 --> 00:37:34.625
It's going to deform
instantaneously to a certain

00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:36.652
length.
The length will depend on the

00:37:36.652 --> 00:37:37.605
force.
The dashpot,

00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:39.739
I apply a force to it,
how will it behave?

00:37:39.739 --> 00:37:44.536
It's going to slowly deform
over time, continuously with a

00:37:44.536 --> 00:37:48.659
constant rate but it will never
stop deforming.

00:37:48.659 --> 00:37:53.773
What would happen if I put a
spring and a dashpot together

00:37:53.773 --> 00:37:56.989
like this?
That is, I have a solid wall

00:37:56.989 --> 00:38:01.496
here, I first attach a spring,
and I attach a dashpot to the

00:38:01.496 --> 00:38:05.490
spring, and now I apply a force.
Well, this spring-dashpot

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.973
combination is going to have
elastic properties,

00:38:07.973 --> 00:38:10.139
it's going to have viscous
properties,

00:38:10.139 --> 00:38:12.239
but it's going to behave in a
certain way.

00:38:12.239 --> 00:38:15.413
When I apply the force,
the force is going to be

00:38:15.413 --> 00:38:18.090
applied over the whole structure
at once.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:27.040
The spring is going to fully
experience that force and it's

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.592
going to stretch out.
Then, the dashpot is also going

00:38:32.592 --> 00:38:36.340
to experience that force and
it's slowly going to deform.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:38.700
What I would observe
experimentally,

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.139
if I could build this spring
dashpot combination,

00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:47.346
is I'd see an initial
deformation and then continuous

00:38:47.346 --> 00:38:51.617
deformation after that.
This is an example of one kind

00:38:51.617 --> 00:38:54.376
of viscoelastic behavior.
If I took my muscle,

00:38:54.376 --> 00:38:58.057
and I did measurements on it,
and I found experimentally that

00:38:58.057 --> 00:39:01.018
it behaved like this,
then I would say,

00:39:01.018 --> 00:39:05.833
'Oh I can describe how the
muscle behaves by this simple

00:39:05.833 --> 00:39:09.949
thought experiment,
this simple mathematical

00:39:09.949 --> 00:39:15.150
construct of a spring and a
dashpot connected together.'

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:18.524
Does that make sense?
Well that's not the only

00:39:18.524 --> 00:39:21.281
way that you could create a
viscous--that you could create

00:39:21.281 --> 00:39:23.119
an imaginary viscoelastic
material.

00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:26.831
I could also attach the spring
and the dashpot in series,

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:30.940
that is, attach both the spring
and the dashpot to the wall,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:34.742
have a little strut connecting
them, and then apply the force

00:39:34.742 --> 00:39:35.440
that way.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:43.469
How would this material behave?
It would behave differently

00:39:43.469 --> 00:39:45.864
because when the force is
applied the spring,

00:39:45.864 --> 00:39:48.150
would like to stretch out but
it can't.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:52.729
It can't because it's
constrained by the dashpot which

00:39:52.729 --> 00:39:56.405
only deforms slowly.
The spring would like to

00:39:56.405 --> 00:40:00.398
deform, would like to take all
of the force and deform,

00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:04.540
but it can't because the
dashpot physically takes time to

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.909
move.
It can only deform at some rate.

00:40:06.909 --> 00:40:12.651
In the initial period the
dashpot is taking all of the

00:40:12.651 --> 00:40:19.260
force and what you would see
initially is slow deformation.

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:24.257
Now, while the dashpot would
like to keep deforming forever,

00:40:24.257 --> 00:40:29.170
this thing can't because the
spring has a limit to how much

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:33.548
it can stretch.
When you get up to the elastic

00:40:33.548 --> 00:40:37.609
limit of the spring,
or the elasticity of the

00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:43.239
spring, the spring is going to
be taking all of the force.

00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:46.530
The dashpot,
then, will have no force on it,

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:51.006
and it will stop deforming.
A viscoelastic material

00:40:51.006 --> 00:40:56.019
that behaved like a spring and a
dashpot in series would have

00:40:56.019 --> 00:40:59.283
this behavior.
It would not have any initial

00:40:59.283 --> 00:41:02.355
deformation.
It would deform slowly at first

00:41:02.355 --> 00:41:06.340
and then it would reach some
maximum deformation like an

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:09.455
elastic solid,
but it would be evolving over

00:41:09.455 --> 00:41:10.180
time.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:16.170
Does this make sense?
Now, these are two simple

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:20.139
models of materials that have
viscous and elastic properties.

00:41:20.139 --> 00:41:23.144
I could measure real materials
and I could see,

00:41:23.144 --> 00:41:26.736
'Well, do they act more like
this, do they act more like

00:41:26.736 --> 00:41:29.139
this?'
I could use these thought

00:41:29.139 --> 00:41:32.570
constructs in order to describe
those materials.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:35.679
I could learn about how the
materials behave under unusual

00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:38.297
conditions that way,
I could start to predict how

00:41:38.297 --> 00:41:41.080
they behave.
It turns out that most real

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:44.655
viscoelastic materials don't
obey either this model or this

00:41:44.655 --> 00:41:47.489
model, but you can build more
complex ones.

00:41:47.489 --> 00:41:50.632
You could imagine having a
spring and dashpot on this side

00:41:50.632 --> 00:41:53.720
and just a dashpot over here,
or you could imagine having

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.638
three elements in a series.
You could imagine all sorts of

00:41:57.638 --> 00:42:01.539
different ways of putting
viscous elements and elastic

00:42:01.539 --> 00:42:05.440
elements together to define an
imaginary material.

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.460
You could then predict how that
imaginary material is going to

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.480
behave and you could see how
close it is to real materials.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.419
What I want you to remember
from this is a couple of

00:42:15.419 --> 00:42:17.809
different things.
One, we talked about elasticity

00:42:17.809 --> 00:42:20.472
at the beginning,
how do purely elastic materials

00:42:20.472 --> 00:42:23.576
behave, you know that.
How do purely viscous materials

00:42:23.576 --> 00:42:25.130
behave?
You understand that.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.053
Real materials,
real biological materials

00:42:28.053 --> 00:42:31.417
have--are viscoelastic.
They have both elastic and

00:42:31.417 --> 00:42:34.197
viscous property,
but that doesn't mean just one

00:42:34.197 --> 00:42:36.910
thing.
That can mean a whole range of

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.815
behaviors.
It's possible in some cases to

00:42:39.815 --> 00:42:43.605
define that whole range of
behaviors by building simple

00:42:43.605 --> 00:42:47.886
thought experiments or simple
models like these spring-dashpot

00:42:47.886 --> 00:42:50.192
combinations.
In general, the

00:42:50.192 --> 00:42:54.084
viscoelastic--real viscoelastic
materials we see are more

00:42:54.084 --> 00:42:58.462
complex than any of the--we have
more complex behaviors than any

00:42:58.462 --> 00:43:01.590
of the idealized models we put
together,

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.430
although sometimes they come
very close.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:08.090
Questions?

00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:15.265
If you looked for the
homework assignment over the

00:43:15.265 --> 00:43:18.409
weekend, and then you look at it
today, or yesterday,

00:43:18.409 --> 00:43:20.950
you will have noticed that it
changed.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:24.251
It became simpler.
I decided that first I had a

00:43:24.251 --> 00:43:26.639
homework assignment that had two
parts.

00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:31.570
The first part of it was to
write an introductory paragraph

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:36.670
for your paper and an outline
for the rest and turn it in.

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:40.569
Then, there was some problems
related to the material for this

00:43:40.569 --> 00:43:43.475
week from Chapter 10.
What I decided to do instead

00:43:43.475 --> 00:43:46.038
was ask you just to focus on
your papers this week,

00:43:46.038 --> 00:43:48.653
and just turn in that
introductory paragraph and the

00:43:48.653 --> 00:43:50.969
outline.
That's all the homework for

00:43:50.969 --> 00:43:54.634
this week, and then we'll put
off the homework assignments on

00:43:54.634 --> 00:43:56.952
this topic,
and what we'll talk about

00:43:56.952 --> 00:43:59.760
Thursday that won't be due until
next Thursday.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.542
I'd like for you to really
focus on your research papers

00:44:02.542 --> 00:44:04.300
this week.
We'll come back and we'll do

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:07.156
the homework set next week.
Then, the week after that there

00:44:07.156 --> 00:44:10.238
won't be any homework except
just to finish your research

00:44:10.238 --> 00:44:12.989
papers and that will be the week
that it's due.

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:16.694
I just wanted you to keep that
in mind, because I know that

00:44:16.694 --> 00:44:20.590
timing and balancing all of your
responsibilities to different

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:23.719
courses is critical at this time
of the year.

00:44:23.719 --> 00:44:28.511
Questions about that or about
what I talked about at the

00:44:28.511 --> 00:44:33.390
beginning: instructions for the
paper, peer-reviewing?

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.256
Good, see you on Thursday.

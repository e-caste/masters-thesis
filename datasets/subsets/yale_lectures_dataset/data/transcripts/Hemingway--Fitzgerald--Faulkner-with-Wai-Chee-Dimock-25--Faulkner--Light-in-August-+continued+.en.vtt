00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.267
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: Last time,
on Tuesday,

00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:15.067
we were talking about
the use of

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:18.300
the word "nigger" by
various people--

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.500
in context, sometimes trying to
be trivializing, sometimes

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.867
obviously agonized, but trying
to disguise that fact.

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:31.700
But sometimes by one's
neighbors,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.733
sometimes by oneself.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:39.500
But always in kind of
a nontrivial usage.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.933
So today, we're turning to the
other side of the phenomenon

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:48.500
and thinking about what it
means to inhabit that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.767
adjective, "nigger" --

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:55.733
what it means to embrace
that as one's identity.

00:00:55.733 --> 00:01:00.167
At least the Joe Christmas part
of the story of Light in

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:04.600
August is really about what it
means for somebody to choose

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600
to be black.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.267
So it's very important to
recognize that this is a

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.767
volitional act.

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:14.067
It is a decision, active
conscious decision.

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:19.200
But in that sense, it's also
about someone poised on two

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.167
contrary possibilities.

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:25.000
Joe Christmas could be either
black or he could be white.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.667
So the either or possibility
is something that actually

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.900
becomes quite important
in American literature

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.200
outside of Faulkner .

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.033
So I just wanted to talk about
one other book published very

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:40.033
close to Light in August
by Nella Larsen.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:45.500
As we can see, Nella Larsen
herself is someone who could

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.467
go either way.

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:51.100
She's classified as African
American, because of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.233
the one drop rule.

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:55.733
So if you have the slightest
bit of African American

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.567
heritage, it classifies
as black.

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:00.133
So she's a black writer.

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.800
But she really could
be anything.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.933
And in fact, she disappeared
in mid career and just

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:11.400
completely vanished
from public, until

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.300
she was found dead.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.200
And there was a lot of surmises
that actually she was

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.667
passing all those years
when she disappeared.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:23.733
And she wrote a novel called
Passing about two black women,

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:27.600
one choosing to be married to
someone who's identifiably

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.133
black, and the other choosing to
pass as a white woman, but

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:36.500
not succeeding, at least
not being very

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.733
happy with that decision.

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:44.400
So Passing, this was published
in 1929, so very close to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.267
Light in August. And as we can
see from the book cover, it's

00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:53.600
really about the choice of
someone who looks completely

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.300
white who is classified as
black, but who chooses to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.567
behave as a white person, live
the life of a white person.

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:12.500
So in Faulkner, what, when you
see is also a kind of passing.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.367
So let's not forget that
actually it's very much

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:20.800
similar to the dynamics in
Nella Larsen's Passing.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.433
It is someone-- a man--

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:27.600
who looks as white as the woman
here, who actually is

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.233
initially classified as white,
but then chooses, in spite of

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:36.200
his outward appearance,
to embrace the

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.367
life of a black man.

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:42.100
So it is passing in the
opposite direction.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.900
It is self-blackening, a white
person blackening himself.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.933
There's no way he can blacken
his interior.

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:54.733
But at least he can try to
blacken his inside, try to

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:59.267
blacken his emotions, his choice
of companions and all

00:03:59.267 --> 00:03:59.800
the rest of it.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.900
So this is what Joe Christmas
decides to do when he starts

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.333
on this run down this long
street that goes from the

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:12.100
south to Chicago to the north.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.700
And endless for 15 years
he's on this street.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.133
And that's what happens to
him when he's on this

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.700
15 year-long street.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.100
"He lived with negroes, shunning
white people, He ate

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.167
with them, slept with them,
belligerent, unpredictable,

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.900
uncommunicative.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.867
He now lives as man and wife
with a woman who resembled an

00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:36.633
ebony carving.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:40.300
At night he would lie in bed
beside her, sleepless,

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.733
beginning to breathe
deep and hard.

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:47.000
He would do it deliberately,
feeling, even watching, his

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.467
white chest arch deeper and
deeper within his ribcage,

00:04:51.467 --> 00:04:55.667
trying to breathe into himself
the dark odor, the dark and

00:04:55.667 --> 00:05:01.833
inscrutable thinking and being
of negroes, with each

00:05:01.833 --> 00:05:05.500
suspiration trying to expel from
himself the white blood

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.900
and the white thinking
and being.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.933
And all the while his nostrils
at the odor which he was

00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:17.800
trying to make his own would
whiten and tauten, his whole

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.100
being writhe and strain with
physical outrage and spiritual

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.733
denial."

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:28.567
So this is an incredible
instance of self-blackening,

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:34.400
somebody who doesn't have to
be black choosing against

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.033
everything in him--

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:41.467
his sense of smell, sense of
sight, his sense of touch,

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:42.400
everything--

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.500
against everything in him, even
though every inch of him

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.933
is revolting against being
classified as black and

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:53.067
associating with blacks.

00:05:53.067 --> 00:05:54.500
That's what he chooses to do.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.200
So it's a very, very
complicated kind of

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.067
psychology.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:02.167
Usually when somebody identifies
with someone, they

00:06:02.167 --> 00:06:05.133
usually, obviously, identify
with us because they really

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:06.700
like that identity.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.400
But in this case, it's absolute
loathing of being

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.300
black, and at the same time,
deciding to be black himself.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.900
So this is a much more complex
psychology that we've seen in

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.633
this novel.

00:06:21.633 --> 00:06:24.467
And I think to understand
this, I think we need to

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:29.067
borrow the terminology from
someone who talks about what

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:35.367
he calls double-consciousness,
So this is W. E. B. Du Bois, a

00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:40.867
very important thinker and
activist from the nineteenth

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:43.933
to basically twentieth
century.

00:06:43.933 --> 00:06:47.833
And he wrote a book called The
Souls of Black Folk, which as

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:51.700
you probably forgot, came out
a while before Light in

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.300
August.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.000
And this is what he
says about blacks.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.367
Let's not forget he's talking
about blacks,

00:06:57.367 --> 00:07:00.133
people who look black.

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:03.067
This is what he says about
the kind of complicated

00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:05.633
consciousness that
blacks have.

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:10.433
"It is a peculiar sensation,
this double-consciousness,

00:07:10.433 --> 00:07:14.767
this sense of always looking at
one's self through the eyes

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:20.067
of others, of measuring one's
soul by a tape of the world

00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:23.933
that looks on in amused
contempt and pity.

00:07:23.933 --> 00:07:26.367
One ever feels his twoness--

00:07:26.367 --> 00:07:31.533
an American, a negro; two
souls, two thoughts, two

00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:37.167
unreconciled strivings, two
warring ideals in one dark

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:41.100
body."

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.367
Keep looking at this person.

00:07:43.367 --> 00:07:48.800
A person who looks black has no
choice but to inhabit this

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.967
double-consciousness, both to
be aware of oneself, as

00:07:52.967 --> 00:07:57.367
oneself, having a completely
internal relation to oneself.

00:07:57.367 --> 00:08:01.033
But at the same time, having
another's views superimposed

00:08:01.033 --> 00:08:04.467
upon oneself, because of
the way other people

00:08:04.467 --> 00:08:06.567
are looking at you.

00:08:06.567 --> 00:08:12.067
So it is this doubleness, one is
looking at oneself through

00:08:12.067 --> 00:08:15.633
involuntarily through the
eyes of other people.

00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:20.000
But we shouldn't forget that, in
fact, Joe Christmas doesn't

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.800
look like a black man.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.567
He looks like the male
counterpart to this white

00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:24.933
looking woman.

00:08:24.933 --> 00:08:28.833
So it's even more complicated
that what Du Bois is

00:08:28.833 --> 00:08:29.500
suggesting.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.367
It's not the
double-consciousness of an

00:08:32.367 --> 00:08:36.867
obviously black man, but the
double-consciousness of a

00:08:36.867 --> 00:08:41.233
white looking person, who even
though he is repelled by the

00:08:41.233 --> 00:08:44.600
blackness, nonetheless
embraces blackness.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.967
So it is just
double-consciousness redoubled

00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:53.700
in terms of this degree
of complexity.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.200
And today, I'd like to talk
about this kind of redoubled

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.800
double-consciousness
in Faulkner along

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.167
three lines of inquiry.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:05.967
One is obviously the importance
of the light and

00:09:05.967 --> 00:09:10.733
shadow, which is epitomized,
dramatized in the title.

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:13.133
The other is something that
we've sort of been talking

00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:16.333
about, the relation between a
single individual and then

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:19.900
kind of the population of
group or multitude.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.367
Today, that's what I'd
like to introduce.

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:25.533
And then something that we've
been talking about all the way

00:09:25.533 --> 00:09:30.967
through about the question of
genre and balance between

00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:32.300
comedy and tragedy.

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:40.667
Also given this configuration,
I'd like to look at three

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:41.700
characters--

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.433
basically the two ends of the
spectrum and a mid point.

00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:47.867
I think that you know which two
ends of the spectrum would

00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:52.300
be, would be Joe Christmas and
Lena Grove, one tragic figure

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.267
and the other a comic figure.

00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:57.700
And between the two of them, I
would like to put now a third

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.333
figure, which is the
Reverend Hightower.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:03.067
We've been talking about
Reverend Hightower in various

00:10:03.067 --> 00:10:06.600
contexts, but I'd like to bring
him to bear now on the

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.767
two obvious protagonists
of Light in August.

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:14.967
But first starting with Joe
Christmas, I'd like to talk

00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:16.433
about three moments--

00:10:16.433 --> 00:10:20.567
actually, there's more than
three-- but three clusters of

00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:25.500
moments revolving around the
act of striking a match.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:31.333
It is so obviously a pattern,
a symbolic pattern revolving

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:34.633
around that act that I think is
really worth thinking about

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:39.333
the three of them in sequence
and in the interrelations.

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:45.700
So the first instance of
striking a match is when he's

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.300
contemplating killing Joanna.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:53.100
"So Christmas lit the cigarette
and snapped the

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.633
match toward the open
door, watching the

00:10:56.633 --> 00:10:59.833
flame vanish in midair.

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:03.833
Then he was listening for the
light, trivial sound which the

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:08.000
dead match would make when
it struck the floor.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.967
And then it seemed to him
that he heard it.

00:11:10.967 --> 00:11:15.233
Then it seemed to him, sitting
on a cot in a dark room, that

00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:19.933
he was hearing a myriad sounds
of no greater volume--

00:11:19.933 --> 00:11:25.433
voices, murmurs, whispers, of
trees, darkness, earth,

00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:30.200
people, his own voice, other
voices evocative of names and

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.467
times and places--

00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:35.367
which he had been conscious of
all his life without knowing

00:11:35.367 --> 00:11:41.733
it, which were his life,
thinking God perhaps and me

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:43.500
not knowing that too.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.200
He could see it like a printed
sentence, fullborn and already

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:54.900
dead God loves me too like the
faded and weathered letters of

00:11:54.900 --> 00:12:00.833
last year's billboard,
God loves me too."

00:12:00.833 --> 00:12:03.833
So it is just an incredible
passage.

00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:06.533
And I just want to say some
obvious things about it and

00:12:06.533 --> 00:12:08.400
then come back to it.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.800
But there's the striking of the
match and then the dying

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.633
out of the match, so literally,

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:16.100
the light dying out.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.067
But what is also interesting is
that actually as the light

00:12:19.067 --> 00:12:25.133
dies out, then it becomes a
completely auditory moment.

00:12:25.133 --> 00:12:29.767
It's all about the sounds that
come to Joe Christmas, the

00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:32.033
voices he hears.

00:12:32.033 --> 00:12:37.467
The light, the visual tableau
completely gives way to an

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:40.733
auditory soundscape,
basically.

00:12:40.733 --> 00:12:44.500
And then there's this
weird kind of

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.833
emergence of his own theology.

00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:54.533
We've been talking about the
importance of Calvin last time

00:12:54.533 --> 00:12:57.867
and the play, the repetition of
the name Calvin in Light in

00:12:57.867 --> 00:13:03.100
August. And here is this obvious
invocation of his

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.200
relation to God and what it
means to repeat that line,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.733
"God loves me too."

00:13:07.733 --> 00:13:10.067
So I just wanted to point out
these obvious things.

00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:13.567
But because this is the last
class, I thought that it would

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:17.267
be good to bring back the
other two authors.

00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:22.533
So just to the obvious detail
of God appearing on the

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:25.567
billboard, we actually have seen
exactly this before in

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:27.033
The Great Gatsby.

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:30.767
"and I said, 'God knows what
you've been doing, everything

00:13:30.767 --> 00:13:31.333
you've been doing.'" --

00:13:31.333 --> 00:13:37.933
This is Michaelis talking
to George Wilson,

00:13:37.933 --> 00:13:41.333
Myrtle's husband --

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:46.333
"Standing behind him Michaelis
saw with a shock that he was

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:50.933
looking at the eyes of Doctor
TJ Eckleburg which had just

00:13:50.933 --> 00:13:54.867
emerged pale and enormous from
the dissolving night."

00:13:54.867 --> 00:14:00.167
So this is George Wilson at the
moment when he's starting

00:14:00.167 --> 00:14:04.967
out on his quest to kill the
killer, the person who he

00:14:04.967 --> 00:14:07.367
thinks kills his wife.

00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:11.733
And pointing to this God
on the billboard as the

00:14:11.733 --> 00:14:15.900
authority, invoking that
authority to justify the

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.267
mission that he's
just beginning.

00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:21.600
The other way in which
Fitzgerald would also come

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.867
into play is obviously the
dynamic mix between the visual

00:14:24.867 --> 00:14:26.133
and the auditory.

00:14:26.133 --> 00:14:28.733
So this is something that we
talked about before about

00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:29.533
Daisy's voice.

00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:33.133
"For a moment the last sunshine
fell with romantic

00:14:33.133 --> 00:14:37.133
affection upon her glowing face;
her voice compelled me

00:14:37.133 --> 00:14:39.800
forward breathlessly
as I listened--

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.400
then the glow faded, each light
deserting her with a

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.500
lingering regret, like children
leaving a pleasant

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.667
street at dusk."

00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:49.900
So the quality of voice
described in

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.933
terms of a visual image.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:56.900
And finally, The Great Gatsby,
and the great self-made man in

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.200
American literature, but
described by Fitzgerald as a

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.100
quasi-religious self-making.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.967
"The truth was that Jay Gatsby
of West Egg, Long Island,

00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:11.567
sprang from his Platonic
conception of himself.

00:15:11.567 --> 00:15:13.533
He was a son of God--

00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:17.100
a phrase, which, if it means
anything, means just that--

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.367
that he must be about his
Father's business, the service

00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:24.333
of a vast, vulgar and
meretricious beauty.

00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:28.867
So he invented just the sort of
Jay Gatsby that a seventeen

00:15:28.867 --> 00:15:32.567
year-old boy would be likely
to invent, and to this

00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:35.000
conception he was faithful
to the end."

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.800
So it is very hard to ignore the
centrality of religion in

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.367
both The Great Gatsby and in
Light in August. In the case

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:49.200
of The Great Gatsby, the
religious language is really

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.667
used to underwrite a special
kind of self-making.

00:15:53.667 --> 00:15:58.167
What it means to be a son of God
in the twentieth century

00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:00.400
and in the debased
environment.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:06.500
And that's the kind of
self-making that Fitzgerald is

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.867
talking of, relatively
non-racialized, even though

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:13.367
we've seen that there's a little
bit of race in The

00:16:13.367 --> 00:16:14.533
Great Gatsby as well.

00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:21.367
So against that example from
Fitzgerald, let's look one

00:16:21.367 --> 00:16:26.233
more time at what Faulkner is
doing with exactly that

00:16:26.233 --> 00:16:29.000
configuration, the billboard,
the interplay between the

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.500
visual and the auditory and
some invocation of God.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:41.633
It seems that when the light
dies out, our only relation to

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:44.767
light is by way of
a dead match--

00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:47.433
a dead match and then
it hits the ground.

00:16:47.433 --> 00:16:50.133
And then the light goes
out completely.

00:16:50.133 --> 00:16:54.600
And instead what we get
is all these sounds

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.500
that come to Joe Christmas.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:02.500
And he becomes an involuntary,
strictly passive recipient of

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.667
sounds that come to him.

00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:06.700
And that it really
is the central

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.500
function of Joe Christmas.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:13.900
We've talked before about how
passive he is, that he's less

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.500
an actor than a recipient of
either the goodwill, or in

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.967
this case, the ill-will coming
from other people.

00:17:21.967 --> 00:17:30.267
So he really is a blank slate,
which other people, the entire

00:17:30.267 --> 00:17:35.133
community, can write the
collective signature.

00:17:35.133 --> 00:17:37.033
He really is the bearer.

00:17:37.033 --> 00:17:40.500
And it's not a very good
metaphor, considering that

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.667
we're looking at an
auditory image.

00:17:42.667 --> 00:17:48.033
But just to switch to visual
image briefly, he's the bearer

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:51.567
of the collective signature
of that community.

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:57.700
So the transition from light to
darkness in this moment and

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:03.200
transition from input coming
into the eye and the input

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.800
coming through the ear is the
increasing of a dramatized

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.967
passivity of Joe Christmas.

00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:13.600
That he's really completely a
blank page that everyone else

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.400
writes the deeds on to.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:19.000
But there's this further
complication, because this is

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.167
a racialized landscape.

00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:27.700
It seems to give us a racialized
version of a

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.200
Calvinist theology that we
talked about last time.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.067
So I just want to think about
what it means that the first

00:18:35.067 --> 00:18:41.500
italicized cluster was "God
perhaps and me not knowing

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.867
that too," and then "God loves
me too," repeated twice.

00:18:44.867 --> 00:18:49.100
It's almost as if the only thing
Joe Christmas is sure

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.167
about is that God loves
other people.

00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:55.933
That is an undisputed
statement.

00:18:55.933 --> 00:18:58.800
So God loves other people.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.367
Maybe God loves everyone else.

00:19:01.367 --> 00:19:05.367
Maybe he loves me too.

00:19:05.367 --> 00:19:12.000
So there can't be a more
devastating self-reflection,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.933
speculation about yourself
is that everyone

00:19:17.933 --> 00:19:19.900
else come before you.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:23.800
Basically, you are an
afterthought, and maybe not

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.167
even an afterthought
in God's mind.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:33.200
And even if it's an
afterthought, it is written on

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.633
God's consciousness.

00:19:34.633 --> 00:19:38.900
It's written like those faded
and weathered letters of last

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:44.300
year's billboard, that
unimportant, that

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.800
negligible to God.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:51.667
So it definitely is an
interesting racialized

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:54.467
variation on predestination.

00:19:54.467 --> 00:19:57.867
So just it's worth going back to
Calvin for that reason and

00:19:57.867 --> 00:20:02.467
see why it actually lends itself
so readily to this

00:20:02.467 --> 00:20:06.500
particular negative kind
of racialization.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:09.267
Last time we talked about
original sin and so on, so

00:20:09.267 --> 00:20:15.333
this another very famous
statement coming from Calvin

00:20:15.333 --> 00:20:17.667
on predestination.

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:21.433
And there's nobody more upfront
than Calvin about

00:20:21.433 --> 00:20:23.667
predestination and
what it means.

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:29.833
"By an eternal and immutable
counsel God has once for all

00:20:29.833 --> 00:20:35.233
determined those who he would
admit to salvation and those

00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:38.933
whom He would condemn
to destruction.

00:20:38.933 --> 00:20:45.300
To those whom He devotes to
condemnation, the gate of life

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:51.600
is closed by a just
irreprehensible, but

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.567
incomprehensible judgement."

00:20:54.567 --> 00:21:01.600
So "the gate of life is closed
by a just and irreprehensible,

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.467
but incomprehensible judgment."
There's no way you

00:21:05.467 --> 00:21:07.967
can quarrel with God.

00:21:07.967 --> 00:21:09.433
It's his decision.

00:21:09.433 --> 00:21:12.967
He decides that you're going
to be condemned.

00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:14.800
It doesn't make any sense
to you, obviously,

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.033
if you're the condemned.

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:18.900
You can't make any
sense of it.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.500
It's completely
incomprehensible.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.500
But at the same time, if you're
a Calvinist you also

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.133
have to believe that
is irreprehensible.

00:21:25.133 --> 00:21:29.633
That God has every right to
condemn you, even though from

00:21:29.633 --> 00:21:32.200
your point of view, it seems
completely arbitrary.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:38.000
So that really is the meaning
of predestination in a

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.667
particular interpretation of a
racialized context is that to

00:21:42.667 --> 00:21:48.200
be black is to be predestined in
that particular way, always

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.400
to come second, always to be
an afterthought, and maybe

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.867
even less than an afterthought
in the mind of God.

00:21:55.867 --> 00:21:59.767
And that is what Joe Christmas
metaphorically as well as

00:21:59.767 --> 00:22:03.533
pragmatically chooses to, given
his own sense of being

00:22:03.533 --> 00:22:06.500
so negligible in the world.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.967
So that would be one
interpretation of why he

00:22:09.967 --> 00:22:12.000
chooses to blacken himself,
even though he

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.733
doesn't have to.

00:22:13.733 --> 00:22:16.700
So this Faulkner's version
of predestination, the

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:20.033
self-blackening of a
white-looking man.

00:22:20.033 --> 00:22:25.533
It completely honors logic of
the gate of life being closed

00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:29.533
by a just and irreprehensible,
but incomprehensible judgment.

00:22:29.533 --> 00:22:32.200
And it's always under
the shadow of race.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.467
So I would say that the part
of Light in August that is

00:22:35.467 --> 00:22:38.400
associated with Joe Christmas
is very much

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.900
the regime of shadows.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.800
And Faulkner's actually quite
heavy-handed about how often--

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.567
we've said the original
title of Light in

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.467
August was Dark House.

00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:53.633
It could also be The Shadows of
August because so much of

00:22:53.633 --> 00:22:56.967
the book is really
about shadows.

00:22:56.967 --> 00:23:00.967
And the shadows tend to
emerge in context

00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:01.900
of striking a match.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.800
So let's go on to the next
moment, next episode of Joe

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:13.233
Christmas striking a match,
lighting a lamp.

00:23:13.233 --> 00:23:18.333
This is the moment after the
dialogue that we looked at

00:23:18.333 --> 00:23:22.567
last time of Joanna offering
to send him to study with a

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:25.200
black lawyer and turning over
all her funds to him.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.400
And then the next thing that she
asks him to do is to kneel

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.100
with her and pray.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.400
So this is all in
that context.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.300
"'Light the lamp,' she said.

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.900
'It won't need any
light,' he said.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.467
'Light the lamp.'
'No,' he said.

00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:41.300
He stood over the bed.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.500
He held the razor in his hand.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:47.367
But it was not open yet.

00:23:47.367 --> 00:23:51.367
But she did not speak again and
then his body seemed to

00:23:51.367 --> 00:23:53.300
walk away from him.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:58.567
It went to the table and his
hands laid the razor on the

00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:02.000
table and found the lamp
and struck the match."

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.333
So very heavy-handed alienation
of Joe Christmas

00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:08.500
from his body.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.433
It's not Joe Christmas that's
doing the walking.

00:24:12.433 --> 00:24:14.900
His body seemed to walk
away from him.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.533
It's not Joe Christmas who's
laying the razor on the table.

00:24:19.533 --> 00:24:22.733
It's his hands that is doing
it and his hands that is

00:24:22.733 --> 00:24:24.100
striking the match to
light the lamp.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:28.367
So it's just the action coming
strictly just from the

00:24:28.367 --> 00:24:32.100
fragmented body parts.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.700
So just highlighting the utter
passivity of Joe Christmas

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.767
himself, is as if his individual
fragmented body

00:24:38.767 --> 00:24:43.433
parts have agency, but not
Joe Christmas as a whole.

00:24:43.433 --> 00:24:47.733
The consequence of lighting
this lamp is this.

00:24:47.733 --> 00:24:50.867
This is what we see when
the lamp is lit.

00:24:50.867 --> 00:24:53.967
He actually see something
else that casts a

00:24:53.967 --> 00:24:55.800
shadow on the wall.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:01.700
"It held an old style, single
action cap-and-ball revolver

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.067
almost as long and heavier
than a small rifle.

00:25:06.067 --> 00:25:10.633
But the shadow of it and of her
arm and hand on the wall

00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:15.933
did not waver at all, the shadow
of both monstrous, the

00:25:15.933 --> 00:25:19.900
cocked hammer monstrous,
back-hooked and viciously

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.867
poised like the arched head
of a snake; it did

00:25:23.867 --> 00:25:24.667
not waver at all.

00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:27.067
And her eyes did not
waver at all.

00:25:27.067 --> 00:25:30.200
They were as still as
the round black ring

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.800
of the pistol muzzle.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.433
But there was no heat
in them, no fury.

00:25:34.433 --> 00:25:36.300
But he was not watching them.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.367
He was watching the shadowed
pistol on the wall; he was

00:25:39.367 --> 00:25:43.667
watching the cocked shadow of
the hammer flicked away."

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:46.133
It's almost as if it's
irrelevant, but it's

00:25:46.133 --> 00:25:47.100
actually going on.

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.033
The most important thing
is the play of that

00:25:49.033 --> 00:25:49.933
shadow on the wall.

00:25:49.933 --> 00:25:53.900
But we do know that the shadow
is produced by that revolver.

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:57.800
But here we have actually the
symmetry of weaponry.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:01.100
So Joe Christmas has come
fully equipped.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.233
He has the razor in his hand,
even though it's not open.

00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:08.467
And Joanna has the revolver
all ready.

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:10.733
And she thinks that
it's ready to go.

00:26:10.733 --> 00:26:13.800
And that's what Joe Christmas
is seeing.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:20.033
So this is the outcome of that
particular relationship that

00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:23.467
is completely under the
shadow of race.

00:26:23.467 --> 00:26:28.433
So we know Joanna would call
him, "Nigger, nigger," or

00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:32.233
"Negro, negro, negro." That
relationship is completely

00:26:32.233 --> 00:26:33.867
under the shadow of race.

00:26:33.867 --> 00:26:36.400
And this is actually the earlier
moment where she talks

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.767
about race as a curse,
as an eternal curse.

00:26:40.767 --> 00:26:43.600
It's the equivalent of
predestination in America.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.333
"But after that I seemed to see
them for the first time

00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:51.000
not as people, but as a thing,
a shadow in which I lived, we

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.900
lived, all white people,
all other people.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.000
I thought of all the children
coming forever and ever into

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.200
the world, white, with the black
shadow already falling

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.600
upon them before they
drew breath.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.333
And I seemed to see the black
shadow in the shape of a

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:06.433
cross."

00:27:06.433 --> 00:27:08.933
I'm not even going to read
you the whole thing.

00:27:08.933 --> 00:27:10.367
You guys remember
this passage.

00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:14.900
It is very much the invocation
of the black shadow as the

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.767
modern incarnation
of the Calvinist

00:27:16.767 --> 00:27:19.467
doctrine of original sin.

00:27:19.467 --> 00:27:25.033
And a curse that falls upon you
before you are even born.

00:27:25.033 --> 00:27:27.100
When you're a baby, before
you've done anything, even

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.067
before when you're in the
mother's womb that shadow is

00:27:30.067 --> 00:27:31.500
already falling upon you.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.200
So it's a very, very
extreme version of

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.133
the Calvinist theology.

00:27:38.133 --> 00:27:42.567
And right here, we also see it
not only as theology, but as

00:27:42.567 --> 00:27:47.400
dramatic action as the shadow
of that pistol on the wall.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.733
And we now know the final
moment of Joe Christmas

00:27:52.733 --> 00:27:55.200
striking the match.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.067
"Then he paused, and he struck
a match and examined the

00:27:59.067 --> 00:28:02.467
pistol in the puny
dying glare.

00:28:02.467 --> 00:28:06.900
The match burned down and went
out, yet he still seemed to

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:12.133
see the ancient thing with its
two loaded chambers; the one

00:28:12.133 --> 00:28:15.900
upon which the hammer had
already fallen and which had

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.467
not exploded, and the other upon
which no hammer had yet

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:24.133
fallen but upon which a hammer
had been planned to fall.

00:28:24.133 --> 00:28:26.200
'For her and for me,' he said.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.267
His arm came back, and threw.

00:28:28.267 --> 00:28:32.733
He heard the pistol crash once
through the undergrowth.

00:28:32.733 --> 00:28:35.567
Then there was no sound again.

00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:37.233
'For her and for me.'"

00:28:37.233 --> 00:28:43.800
So this is basically the
tragic love in Light in

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.800
August. That there's
no denying the

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:48.100
importance of tragedy.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.033
It depends on how much weight we
assign to the Joe Christmas

00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:57.300
Joanna Burden section
of the novel.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:03.467
If we were to give primacy
to that section, then the

00:29:03.467 --> 00:29:05.000
symmetry of weapons--

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.633
the razor and the pistol, both
chambers loaded in Joanna's

00:29:11.633 --> 00:29:14.167
pistol-- she really
means for the two

00:29:14.167 --> 00:29:16.033
of them to die together.

00:29:16.033 --> 00:29:20.500
This is the appropriate end for
a tragic narrative, even

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.233
though Joe Christmas doesn't
die at the end.

00:29:23.233 --> 00:29:27.400
Nonetheless, the stage is really
set for that particular

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.400
tragic outcome.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.133
So there's really not
a whole lot more.

00:29:33.133 --> 00:29:35.167
It couldn't be any
other outcome.

00:29:35.167 --> 00:29:40.533
There could be no other ending
for Joe Christmas and Joanna.

00:29:40.533 --> 00:29:44.033
Either one of them had to die or
the two of them had to die.

00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:48.933
But Faulkner can't really think
of any other ending for

00:29:48.933 --> 00:29:50.200
the two of them.

00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:55.533
But thank God they're not the
only ones in Light in August.

00:29:55.533 --> 00:30:01.200
So we're beginning to move to
someone, towards the other

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.233
side of the spectrum.

00:30:03.233 --> 00:30:05.867
And actually a very interesting
transitional

00:30:05.867 --> 00:30:10.533
figure of someone who's at
midpoint between Joe Christmas

00:30:10.533 --> 00:30:13.300
and Lena Grove is Hightower.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.700
And actually the image of the
light and shadow and kind of

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.900
contrast between light and
shadow is also the visual

00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:27.200
landscape in which Hightower
is situated.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:32.033
So this is the moment when Byron
Bunch and Joe Christmas

00:30:32.033 --> 00:30:33.933
grandparents-- at this
point we sort of know

00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:36.433
that they are related.

00:30:36.433 --> 00:30:42.467
But basically Byron Bunch going
to Hightower and begging

00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:47.633
him to tell a lie so that Joe
Christmas can have an alibi.

00:30:47.633 --> 00:30:51.167
So Byron says it's really your
word against Joe Brown's.

00:30:51.167 --> 00:30:55.467
If you would just say that he
was with you that night, that

00:30:55.467 --> 00:30:58.233
will be better, stronger
evidence than anything coming

00:30:58.233 --> 00:30:59.867
from Joe Brown.

00:30:59.867 --> 00:31:04.733
So Hightower could have told a
lie, and the lynching wouldn't

00:31:04.733 --> 00:31:05.500
have happened.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.967
But this is what he does.

00:31:07.967 --> 00:31:11.800
"Because now Hightower is
shouting, 'I won't do it!

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.133
I won't!' with his hands raised
and clenched, his face

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:20.200
sweating, his lip lifted upon
his clenched and rotting teeth

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.467
from about which the long
sagging of flabby and

00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:26.433
puttycolored flesh falls away.

00:31:26.433 --> 00:31:29.600
Suddenly his voice rises higher
yet. 'Get out!' he

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.033
screams. 'Get out of my house!

00:31:31.033 --> 00:31:34.500
Get out of my house!' Then he
falls forward on to the desk,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:39.267
his face between his extended
arms and his clenched first.

00:31:39.267 --> 00:31:43.600
As, the two old people moving
ahead of him, Byron looks back

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.300
from the door, he sees that
Hightower has not moved, his

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:52.233
bald had and his expanded
clenchfisted arms lying full

00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:57.133
in the pool of light from
the shaded lamp."

00:31:57.133 --> 00:32:01.100
So this particular visual image
suggests that Hightower

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.100
is completely poised between
light and shadow.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.167
There's light that is coming
from a shaded lamp.

00:32:08.167 --> 00:32:11.967
And he's given an opportunity
actually to do something

00:32:11.967 --> 00:32:13.833
significant in the world.

00:32:13.833 --> 00:32:16.833
To have saved Joe Christmas
would have been a significant

00:32:16.833 --> 00:32:20.267
deed in the life of someone who
actually has not done a

00:32:20.267 --> 00:32:22.400
lot of significant things.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.967
His life could have been much
more consequential, and in

00:32:27.967 --> 00:32:30.733
fact, hasn't been all
that consequential.

00:32:30.733 --> 00:32:32.933
So saving Joe Christmas
would have been a

00:32:32.933 --> 00:32:35.333
consequential action.

00:32:35.333 --> 00:32:39.300
But Hightower just cannot bring
himself to do it for all

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:39.800
kinds of reasons.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:44.867
So we can speculate on why
he chooses not to do it.

00:32:44.867 --> 00:32:49.667
But that is a moment when his
voice is very high as

00:32:49.667 --> 00:32:52.033
befitting his name, Hightower.

00:32:52.033 --> 00:32:57.267
But what that very high voice is
doing is turning away this

00:32:57.267 --> 00:32:58.533
opportunity.

00:32:58.533 --> 00:33:00.867
I think that all of us would
have different decisions

00:33:00.867 --> 00:33:02.600
whether or not to lie
at that moment.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.933
His decision is not to lie and
to allow the violence to

00:33:05.933 --> 00:33:08.900
erupt, as everyone can see
that it's about to.

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.967
So this is the moment when he's
sort of in this light

00:33:15.967 --> 00:33:17.967
from the poor light of
the shaded lamp.

00:33:17.967 --> 00:33:22.433
But there's another possibility
for Hightower that

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:25.400
comes actually only five
pages after that.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:29.600
So Faulkner actually, I would
say, is quite gentle towards

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:35.000
Hightower in terms of the final
place given to him in

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.833
the story, in the novel.

00:33:37.833 --> 00:33:40.767
So we know that once before
Hightower's had

00:33:40.767 --> 00:33:42.333
tried deliver a baby.

00:33:42.333 --> 00:33:48.067
So we have a black woman, and
the doctor's supposed to come,

00:33:48.067 --> 00:33:49.367
and the doctor arrives
too late.

00:33:49.367 --> 00:33:52.800
So Hightower delivers the baby,
and the baby is dead.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.067
And then rumors go all around
town that the baby

00:33:55.067 --> 00:33:56.467
is his and so on.

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:59.067
So it turns out that he actually
get a second chance

00:33:59.067 --> 00:34:00.300
to deliver a baby.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.933
And of course, we know
whose baby it is.

00:34:02.933 --> 00:34:06.633
But he gets to deliver the baby,
because the doctor also

00:34:06.633 --> 00:34:10.367
arrives too late
a second time.

00:34:10.367 --> 00:34:14.733
"The doctor arrived too
late this time, also.

00:34:14.733 --> 00:34:17.600
Byron had to wait for
him to dress" --

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.333
Byron's sent to fetch
the doctor --

00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:21.367
"Byron had to wait
for him to dress.

00:34:21.367 --> 00:34:24.100
He was an oldish man now
and fussy, and somewhat

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.700
disgruntled at having been
awakened at this hour.

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.433
Then he had to hunt for the
switch key to his car, which

00:34:30.433 --> 00:34:33.800
he kept in a small metal strong
box, the key to which

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.833
in turn he could not
find at once...

00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:39.433
So when they reached the cabin
at last, the east was

00:34:39.433 --> 00:34:43.767
primrosecolor and there was
already a hint of the swift

00:34:43.767 --> 00:34:45.967
sun of summer.

00:34:45.967 --> 00:34:50.733
And again the two men, both
older now, met a door of a

00:34:50.733 --> 00:34:55.533
one-room cabin, the professional
having lost again

00:34:55.533 --> 00:34:59.400
to the amateur, for as he
entered the door, the doctor

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:02.600
heard the infant cry."

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:08.600
So it is crucial that this is a
repetition, this is a replay

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.400
of an earlier scenario that
Faulkner ends on is this over

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.767
again, if it's a second
time or it's too

00:35:14.767 --> 00:35:16.200
late this time also.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.967
Also and again.

00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:22.233
So it turns out that actually
the second time around makes

00:35:22.233 --> 00:35:24.000
all the difference
in the world.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.900
Because at this time Hightower
is able to deliver the baby

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:31.400
successfully.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.100
This is actually the
consequential action that he

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.167
manages to do, that
is granted him.

00:35:38.167 --> 00:35:44.200
He's not granted the whatever,
the bravery, or I don't even

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.467
know what word to use if
he had chosen to lie.

00:35:48.467 --> 00:35:53.133
He's not granted that, whatever,
mental ability or

00:35:53.133 --> 00:35:59.300
mental toughness to lie
for Joe Christmas.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:03.567
But he is granted something
that actually is both more

00:36:03.567 --> 00:36:07.467
uncontroversial and with an
obviously benign outcome--

00:36:07.467 --> 00:36:11.533
to deliver a baby when the
professional doctor is too

00:36:11.533 --> 00:36:13.567
late this time too.

00:36:13.567 --> 00:36:17.867
So it turns out Faulkner is
giving us, not only-- and then

00:36:17.867 --> 00:36:19.700
that is why the
double-consciousness is

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.433
redoubled or maybe redoubled
again in Light in August is

00:36:24.433 --> 00:36:29.867
that there are two meanings
to being second.

00:36:29.867 --> 00:36:35.800
In Joe Christmas' usage, "God
loves me too," being second

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.100
means that basically
you are nobody.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:40.167
That you are nothing.

00:36:40.167 --> 00:36:42.167
That you count for
nothing at all.

00:36:42.167 --> 00:36:44.867
You're always going to
be an afterthought.

00:36:44.867 --> 00:36:49.400
"God loves me too." That's what
being second-- it means

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:52.333
losing out and not even having
the dignity of losing out.

00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:56.300
Just meaning being a
non-contender really, in a

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.667
field where everyone else is
going to be ahead of you.

00:36:59.667 --> 00:37:05.433
Being a non-contender is what
being second, having the word

00:37:05.433 --> 00:37:08.167
"too" attached to you.

00:37:08.167 --> 00:37:13.167
But that's not the only meaning
of "too" or in the

00:37:13.167 --> 00:37:17.900
variation, "also." So the second
time we see that in the

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:22.600
case of Hightower, "the doctor
arrived too late this time

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:28.300
also," second actually means
a second chance.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:33.867
That you messed up the first
time around-- or it wasn't so

00:37:33.867 --> 00:37:35.067
much messing up.

00:37:35.067 --> 00:37:38.600
Some babies are just
born dead.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:41.967
But I think there was
some messing up.

00:37:41.967 --> 00:37:43.467
It wasn't a satisfied outcome.

00:37:43.467 --> 00:37:46.400
It wasn't an acceptable outcome
to most people.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.733
So you messed up the first time
around, you get a second

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:52.333
chance to do it one more time.

00:37:52.333 --> 00:37:57.200
So being second actually
completely supports that

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.067
second usage.

00:37:59.067 --> 00:38:03.433
And that is why, to my mind,
Hightower is such an important

00:38:03.433 --> 00:38:10.233
midpoint between Joe Christmas
and Lena Grove is that he is

00:38:10.233 --> 00:38:18.433
actually taking us halfway in
the direction of a much more

00:38:18.433 --> 00:38:22.600
affirmative view of what is
possible, a much more

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.067
affirmative view of the world.

00:38:26.067 --> 00:38:29.933
But it is important to recognize
that is actually a

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:33.067
completely accidental
development.

00:38:33.067 --> 00:38:40.033
There's no reason, no logical
reason why the doctor should

00:38:40.033 --> 00:38:40.833
arrive too late.

00:38:40.833 --> 00:38:42.433
It's only because the doctor
arrives too late that

00:38:42.433 --> 00:38:44.233
Hightower gets to deliver
the baby.

00:38:44.233 --> 00:38:46.600
The doctor arrives too late
because he's old and didn't

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.033
want to be awakened up in the
middle of the night, can't

00:38:49.033 --> 00:38:50.833
find his key to the car.

00:38:50.833 --> 00:38:55.700
All these accidental
developments contribute to--

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.400
and the doctor, other than the
fact that he's appeared once

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.200
before, he really is an absolute
stranger to the

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:04.033
novel, he's such a marginal
character.

00:39:04.033 --> 00:39:10.233
So the second chance coming to
Hightower comes to him by

00:39:10.233 --> 00:39:14.500
virtue of the pregnancy and
the childbirth of a total

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:20.533
stranger, Lena Grove, and the
accidental lateness of another

00:39:20.533 --> 00:39:23.333
accidental person, the doctor.

00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:31.900
So we're beginning to get into
an arena where it's really not

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:38.700
Hightower's action alone, but
the combined action of all

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:43.467
these other people, many of
whom are strangers to him.

00:39:43.467 --> 00:39:46.933
It is the combined action of all
these people that produce

00:39:46.933 --> 00:39:47.367
an outcome.

00:39:47.367 --> 00:39:51.500
So this is a moment to introduce
some theoretical

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.600
speculation on this point.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.800
And James Surowiecki is a staff

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.267
writer for The New Yorker.

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:08.133
But five, ten years ago, he
wrote a book called The Wisdom

00:40:08.133 --> 00:40:10.467
of Crowds, which actually
got a lot of attention

00:40:10.467 --> 00:40:11.733
when it came out.

00:40:11.733 --> 00:40:20.333
And his basic argument is that
the collective decision or

00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:24.333
just the collective conjecture,
when there's a

00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:27.600
shortage of information, the
collective conjecture, the

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.633
collective guesswork, the
aggregation of guesses from a

00:40:31.633 --> 00:40:35.467
lot of people, that aggregation
is always going to

00:40:35.467 --> 00:40:40.400
be closer to the truth than the
single guess of a single

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:40.933
individual.

00:40:40.933 --> 00:40:42.500
So it's actually a kind
of a complicated

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.900
mathematical argument.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.433
It's about the aggregation of
conjecture being better,

00:40:49.433 --> 00:40:51.967
having a much higher
likelihood of being

00:40:51.967 --> 00:40:53.133
closer to the truth.

00:40:53.133 --> 00:40:55.933
So even though it doesn't talk
about statistic, actually it's

00:40:55.933 --> 00:41:00.767
very statistical in its mode of
thinking, that it's about

00:41:00.767 --> 00:41:03.300
chances and likelihood
and so on.

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:08.200
The other book that is also
relevant and actually has the

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:13.300
title Multitude is by Michael
Hardt and Antonio Negri.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.800
It's a proven view with the
first substance of that

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.600
argument, but just one--

00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:21.667
It's really not about what
we're talking about.

00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:25.267
But there is one line that is
relevant to what we've been

00:41:25.267 --> 00:41:29.667
talking about, which is about
the thinking about what the

00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:34.633
meaning multitude could have.
For them multitude, is "the

00:41:34.633 --> 00:41:38.000
cooperative convergence
of subjects. . .

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.067
Only the multitude through its
practical experimentation will

00:41:43.067 --> 00:41:48.367
offer the models and determine
when and how the possible

00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:49.900
becomes the real."

00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:56.933
So it has some resemblance to
this Surowiecki argument,

00:41:56.933 --> 00:41:59.500
which is that it is about
how the possible

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.733
can become the real.

00:42:00.733 --> 00:42:04.167
And it turns out that the
collective conjecture, the

00:42:04.167 --> 00:42:09.900
aggregation of individual
guesswork, or the aggregation

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:15.767
of action from a lot people
would put us in closer contact

00:42:15.767 --> 00:42:20.167
to how the possible can
become the real.

00:42:20.167 --> 00:42:24.400
So these are the two sort of
contemporary lines of thinking

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.800
about groups and about human
populations as opposed to

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.000
human individuals as the
agents of history.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.267
It turns out that actually
there's also a nineteenth

00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:38.867
century precedent
for Faulkner.

00:42:38.867 --> 00:42:42.967
And we're so used to thinking
of The Scarlet Letter of a

00:42:42.967 --> 00:42:45.433
condemnation as the bigotry
of Puritans.

00:42:45.433 --> 00:42:48.100
But let's not forget actually
that Hawthorne's a very

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:51.567
important statement about
multitude that runs completely

00:42:51.567 --> 00:42:56.700
contrary to our stereotypical
vision of Puritans.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:00.733
"When an uninstructed multitude
attempts to see with

00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:05.367
its eyes, it is exceedingly
apt to be deceived.

00:43:05.367 --> 00:43:10.200
When, however, it forms its
judgment, as it usually does,

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.167
on the intuitions of its great
and warm heart, the

00:43:14.167 --> 00:43:19.167
conclusions thus attained are
often so profound and so

00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:23.233
unerring as to possess the
character of truths

00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:26.233
supernaturally revealed."

00:43:26.233 --> 00:43:29.567
It's astonishing statement from
The Scarlet Letter saying

00:43:29.567 --> 00:43:34.600
that in fact that the great
and warm heart is not the

00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.533
attribute of a single
individual.

00:43:37.533 --> 00:43:42.867
That in fact, the human heart
in its individual embodiment

00:43:42.867 --> 00:43:45.867
is likely to have lots and
lots of shadows in it.

00:43:45.867 --> 00:43:51.400
And the only way that those
shadows can be relatively

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.800
deactivated is when we
think and aggregate.

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.700
I think it's a really
interesting theory.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:01.167
Just offering it to you
as a possibility.

00:44:01.167 --> 00:44:05.667
But I do think that this is what
Faulkner thinks in the

00:44:05.667 --> 00:44:10.400
use total strangers, doctors,
people who have no relation to

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.867
one another in Light in August.
So basically, his

00:44:13.867 --> 00:44:17.400
notion of the multitude is that
it's randomized, it's

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.400
statistical, it's populational,
it's chancy.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.267
And this is the moment, and I
think this is the extreme

00:44:26.267 --> 00:44:30.333
moment in Light in August right
before the killing,

00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:31.767
actually, of Joe Christmas.

00:44:31.767 --> 00:44:35.867
This, essentially what we get,
is -- utterly doesn't go with

00:44:35.867 --> 00:44:38.067
the deed that follows,
but this is what

00:44:38.067 --> 00:44:39.300
Faulkner gives us.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.900
"In the lambent suspension of
August into which night is

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:45.733
about to fully come, it seems
to engender and surround

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:48.367
itself with a faint
glow like a halo.

00:44:48.367 --> 00:44:50.933
The halo is full of faces.

00:44:50.933 --> 00:44:54.800
The faces are not shaped with
suffering, not shaped with

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.833
anything, not horror, pain,
or even reproach.

00:44:57.833 --> 00:45:02.367
They are peaceful, as though
they have escaped an

00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:04.367
apotheosis; his own
is among them."

00:45:04.367 --> 00:45:06.500
So I don't need to talk
any more about that.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.167
Just that the halo is not the
halo around a single face.

00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:13.933
It is full of faces.

00:45:13.933 --> 00:45:19.733
And that's the reason why he
goes right back to how he

00:45:19.733 --> 00:45:23.700
starts up, by talking about
the kindness of strangers.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:28.767
And this kindness of strangers
is not even ironized by

00:45:28.767 --> 00:45:33.333
everything that has happened in
between page one of Light

00:45:33.333 --> 00:45:38.300
in August and the last pages
of Light in August. The

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:42.533
kindness of strangers, yes, it
has to recognize and take into

00:45:42.533 --> 00:45:46.333
account and fully acknowledge
and put in the foreground the

00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:47.867
cruelty of one's neighbors.

00:45:47.867 --> 00:45:48.833
No question about it.

00:45:48.833 --> 00:45:50.867
It has to encompass
all of that.

00:45:50.867 --> 00:45:53.467
But the kindness of
strangers remains.

00:45:53.467 --> 00:45:59.067
So he's totally happy to bring
in a person never before

00:45:59.067 --> 00:46:01.700
mentioned in Light in
August in the last

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:03.067
pages of the novel.

00:46:03.067 --> 00:46:06.067
"There lives in the eastern part
of the state a furniture

00:46:06.067 --> 00:46:09.367
repairer and dealer who recently
made a trip into

00:46:09.367 --> 00:46:12.300
Tennessee to get some old pieces
of furniture which he

00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.500
had bought by correspondence."

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:18.400
A completely extraneous detail
at the end of the novel.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.900
And the reason this furniture
dealer is in the picture

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.967
suddenly is that he's there to
witness this ongoing courtship

00:46:26.967 --> 00:46:32.700
between Lena Grove
and Byron Bunch.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:37.333
So let's see what Faulkner
thinks about marriage.

00:46:37.333 --> 00:46:41.600
And it turns out that he
actually has given some

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:42.667
thought to his rival.

00:46:42.667 --> 00:46:48.500
The relation between the two of
them is not always cordial.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.133
So it is Faulkner writing
to Malcolm Cowley.

00:46:51.133 --> 00:46:52.367
"I'll write to Hemingway.

00:46:52.367 --> 00:46:55.133
Poor bloke to have to marry
three times to find out that

00:46:55.133 --> 00:46:56.533
marriage is a failure...

00:46:56.533 --> 00:47:00.533
Apparently man can be cured of
drugs, gambling, biting his

00:47:00.533 --> 00:47:03.900
nails and picking his nose,
but not of marrying."

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.933
Saying this is what we're
addicted to is marriage.

00:47:06.933 --> 00:47:10.800
It doesn't matter if you fail
1,000 times, you still want to

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.967
get married.

00:47:11.967 --> 00:47:17.233
So given the fact, this totally
clear-eyed evaluation

00:47:17.233 --> 00:47:19.533
of the outcome of marriage, but
also the fact that it's

00:47:19.533 --> 00:47:24.633
just going to be an ongoing
addiction, we should not be

00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:27.967
surprised by what comes of it at
the end of Light in August.

00:47:27.967 --> 00:47:31.000
When we're talking about
Hemingway I want to remind you

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.833
that we've seen this kind
of structure before.

00:47:33.833 --> 00:47:37.400
The ending of For Whom the Bell
Tolls, "He lay flat on

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:40.733
the brown, pine-needled floor of
the forest, his chin on his

00:47:40.733 --> 00:47:43.367
folded arms." Beginning of the
novel, end of novel, "He could

00:47:43.367 --> 00:47:46.367
feel his heart beating against
the pine-needled floor of the

00:47:46.367 --> 00:47:48.567
forest."

00:47:48.567 --> 00:47:52.233
Light in August, at the
beginning and ending.

00:47:52.233 --> 00:47:55.900
Beginning, "although I have not
been quite a month on the

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.900
road, I'm already in
Mississippi." And ending of

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:02.000
Light in August, "Here we ain't
been coming from Alabama

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.200
for two months, and now it's
already Tennessee.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.733
So it is Lena Grove counting on
the kindness of strangers

00:48:10.733 --> 00:48:15.467
and counting on the statistical
fact that to every

00:48:15.467 --> 00:48:19.867
Lucas Birch, there will was
always be a Byron Bunch.

00:48:19.867 --> 00:48:22.433
Because marriage is
an addiction.

00:48:22.433 --> 00:48:25.233
So that's why it is comedy.

00:48:25.233 --> 00:48:27.233
Thank you very much.

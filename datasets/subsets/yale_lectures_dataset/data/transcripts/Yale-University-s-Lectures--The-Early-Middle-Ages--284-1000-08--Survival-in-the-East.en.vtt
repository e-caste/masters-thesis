00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:02.933
PAUL FREEDMAN: Alright, so
today the question

00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:06.900
we're going to deal with is
the survival of the Roman

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.000
Empire in the East. Why did
the Empire, based in

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.233
Constantinople, survive,
whereas, as we saw last week,

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:20.233
the Western Empire based,
nominally, in Rome-- at times

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.000
in Milan, at times
in Ravenna--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.433
collapsed in the
fifth century?

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.367
We're going to take a long view
of survival in the East -

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.467
that is, from the
fifth century to

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.900
the mid-ninth century.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.600
After the mid-ninth century,
the Eastern Roman Empire

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.000
flourishes and has a period,
that we will discuss in a few

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.867
weeks, of great splendor
and prosperity.

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:50.833
But this long view is justified
by the fact that for

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:57.267
400 years, or so, this Eastern
Roman Empire faced tremendous

00:00:57.267 --> 00:01:03.867
threats of invasion, sieges,
difficulties dealing with all

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:08.033
sorts of nations and peoples,
and, at the same time,

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.000
internal division, because
of religious controversy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.567
Or what the people who
won, called heresies.

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:18.133
I remind you that while we
call it the Eastern Roman

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:22.033
Empire or the Byzantine Empire,
they called themselves

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:28.067
the Roman Empire no adjective,
no qualification.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:31.033
They were the successor to--

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.700
and if they were the only
successor, tough luck--

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.967
the empire of Augustus, the
empire of Diocletian, the

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:42.200
empire of Constantine.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.133
In their base, before the
seventh century, they were, as

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:53.767
you see on the map.

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:56.500
The map really shows them, more
or less, at their height.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.967
Eastern Roman Empire-- notice
that it goes as far as Spain

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:04.767
in the Mediterranean.

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:08.033
This was the accomplishment of
Justinian, and emperor of the

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:13.200
sixth century, whose reign
marks a kind of apogee, a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.067
height of power of this
empire, within in

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:19.800
this period of crisis.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.467
So while I'm saying that we are
dealing with about four

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:28.400
century's worth of sieges and
crises, there is this period

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.833
in the sixth century, in the
reign of Justinian, who

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:39.900
represents a kind of brief, but
very important, reconquest

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.667
of the West. And that's partly
what you're seeing, at least

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:47.767
the leftovers of it, in this
map, that shows you the

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.833
Byzantine or Eastern Roman
Empire in the year 600,

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:51.967
extending--

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:57.167
including Spain, North Africa,
the coast of what's now Libya,

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:01.600
Egypt, the Mediterranean
Middle East--

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.933
that is modern Israel,
Syria, Lebanon--

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:07.600
Anatolia--

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.733
that is to say Asia Minor,
modern Turkey--

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:15.867
and the Balkans, Greece,
and the Aegean Islands.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:19.933
This empire was held together
by Constantinople, which, as

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:23.233
you see, and as we've already
spoken about, is strategically

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:26.967
placed to control access between
Europe and Asia,

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:31.867
across the Bosporus Straits,
and also between the Black

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:36.867
Sea, which is the access point
to Central Asia and the

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:39.333
Mediterranean Sea.

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:43.667
This city, modern Istanbul,
still has the walls built by

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:47.233
Theodosius II, in the
early fifth century.

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:49.400
The so-called Theodosian
Walls--

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.067
rather nastily restored
recently--

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:59.200
are an incredible monument,
still, in their ruined state,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.767
to the power of Constantinople,
as they were

00:04:04.767 --> 00:04:07.200
built on the landward side.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.333
Constantinople--

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:11.933
very difficult to attack from
the sea, and, because of the

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:15.000
walls, very difficult to
attack from the land.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.667
Until very recently, that is, I
would say, until the 1980s,

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:23.833
the Theodosian walls were
not reached by the urban

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.500
agglomeration of Istanbul.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.433
That is, they were so big and so
far from the main center of

00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:35.033
the city, that only in recent
decades has Istanbul, which is

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:38.567
one of the fastest growing and
most prosperous cities in the

00:04:38.567 --> 00:04:43.467
region, has the city leapfrogged
over the walls,

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:46.733
and the walls are now in
the kind of midst of a

00:04:46.733 --> 00:04:48.333
new part of the city.

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:51.300
Nevertheless, extremely
impressive accomplishment.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.433
And the period we're dealing
with is mostly sieges of

00:04:56.433 --> 00:04:59.467
Constantinople and heresies.

00:04:59.467 --> 00:05:02.800
And if you just hold that in
your mind, this, somewhat,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.433
"one event after another, that
I never heard of," quality,

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:09.300
that this will have, I think
will be, if not alleviated, at

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.167
least rendered comprehensible.

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:13.000
Before we go on, let
me just say a

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.100
few words about Procopius.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.100
Who has read the Secret
History before?

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.533
OK.

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:21.833
So not too much.

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:23.200
You should have started it.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.233
I should've warned you.

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:31.000
It has disturbing, even weirdly
pornographic parts.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.467
It is a diatribe against
the Emperor Justinian.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:37.767
I don't think I'm giving
anything away by saying that

00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:40.400
Procopius' theory about
Justinian is that he's a

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.033
demon, a devil, a representative
of hell.

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:46.567
What makes this text
interesting, is it's an

00:05:46.567 --> 00:05:50.500
intimate portrayal, even if it
may not be an accurate one.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.667
But we will pay a certain
price-- we are willing to pay

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:57.900
a certain price for intimacy,
for immediacy, for the sense

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.167
of an extremely sinister
court.

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:04.333
It's a little bit like reading
about Stalin, or some other

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:08.800
capricious, extremely powerful,
hard-working, but

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.267
bloodthirsty ruler.

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:15.800
I think what you have to ask
yourself is, how could a ruler

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.200
of this particular time and
polity, not be bloodthirsty?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.700
What seems to be Procopius'
problem?

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.967
And we'll elucidate some
answers on Wednesday.

00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:31.600
Procopius, in part, is
interesting, because all of

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.033
this other works are lavish in
their praise of Justinian.

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:39.867
This is an historian who
knows nothing between

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:45.800
panegyric and diatribe.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.500
Nothing between lavish servile
praise and the harshest

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.433
imaginable criticism.

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:55.967
The two go together.

00:06:55.967 --> 00:07:00.800
The two are phenomena, again,
all of absolutist courts from

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:07.200
that of Louis XIV to that of
twentieth century dictators.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.833
The same kind of enforced praise
can create a kind of

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:16.900
humiliation and rage that comes
out in other forms.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.267
A Secret History had to be
secret, because had the

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:24.500
authorities read a few words of
this, Procopius would have

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.000
not died in bed, as,
indeed, he did.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.300
We know this from one manuscript
in the Vatican

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.833
found in the seventeenth
century.

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:33.300
OK.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.133
So that's my introduction
to Procopius.

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:39.333
When we talk about survival of
the East, we're talking about

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:42.233
survival under several
different kinds of

00:07:42.233 --> 00:07:43.167
circumstances.

00:07:43.167 --> 00:07:49.500
So our first concern is, how did
the East survive the fifth

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:55.733
century, which destroyed the
Western Roman Empire?

00:07:55.733 --> 00:07:57.400
Part of the answer
is geography.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:02.000
The East was easier to defend,
especially, as I've just said,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.333
the position of Constantinople,
both as an

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:10.967
impregnable site and as a
commercial city with very,

00:08:10.967 --> 00:08:15.633
very extensive trade, and as a
base to defend the two core

00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:18.067
territories of the Empire.

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:21.733
By core territories, I mean
that, really, the essential

00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:24.800
parts of this empire, which
are the Balkans--

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.300
including Greece under that
rubric, for the moment--

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.400
and Asia Minor.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.033
And, of course, Constantinople
is ideally placed to protect

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:35.300
both of them.

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.467
Other advantages of the
East over the West--

00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:43.600
a bit richer, more urbanized,
produced more taxable revenues

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.800
than the West. It's army
didn't fall apart.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.400
It's civilian structure of

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.200
administration remained intact.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.033
With the exception of Justinian,
very few these

00:08:57.033 --> 00:09:00.867
emperors are that outstanding
in their abilities.

00:09:00.867 --> 00:09:05.800
But their subordinates were very
capable, the government

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:13.733
worked well, and the East
survived a number of powerful

00:09:13.733 --> 00:09:15.167
threats from the outside.

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:20.100
"From the outside" meaning it
had the same problem as the

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.500
Roman Empire, in an, admittedly,
smaller and more

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.400
defensible space.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.500
It had an eastern frontier and
it had a northern frontier,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.033
both of which were fragile.

00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:34.767
The eastern frontier
with Persia--

00:09:34.767 --> 00:09:37.000
we already talked about them--

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.733
and the Northern frontier, along
the Danube River, more

00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:44.600
or less, with all sorts of
different peoples, from the

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.133
Avars, Slavs, Bulgars, all
sorts of nations that

00:09:50.133 --> 00:09:52.600
would attack it.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.200
It also had the disadvantage of
internal religious dissent.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.633
And we're going to be talking
more about this.

00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:06.567
These problems, eventually, did
affect the East adversely.

00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:11.467
It would have a period of pretty
radical decline, not so

00:10:11.467 --> 00:10:17.500
different from that of the West.
Beginning in the seventh

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:22.833
century, this decline can be
seen in the abandonment of

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:26.800
many cities, or their much
smaller population--

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:29.300
we've already seen that as
a feature of the West--

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:30.967
in the loss of territory.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.333
We're going to be talking
about Islam

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:37.167
and the Arab conquests.

00:10:37.167 --> 00:10:40.200
But they begin in the seventh
century, and, very quickly,

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.267
result in the loss, from the
Byzantine point of view, of

00:10:45.267 --> 00:10:54.567
Egypt and the Mediterranean
Near East.

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:57.067
But unlike the West, the
Byzantine, or East Roman

00:10:57.067 --> 00:11:00.233
government, never collapsed in
the face of these threats.

00:11:00.233 --> 00:11:04.500
Although, it is a kind of period
of cultural decline.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.200
Certainly, a period of military
defeats, of sieges,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.067
of political problems, and
of religious dissent.

00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:13.633
Nevertheless, the Empire
would survive.

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:21.633
In general, during this period,
what unites these 400

00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:24.633
years-- we're talking about,
roughly, 450 to 850--

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:29.900
is the ability of the empire
to resist invasions, its

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.100
willingness to accept the loss
of certain provinces, while

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:43.567
protecting others, and its
domination of Constantinople

00:11:43.567 --> 00:11:44.667
over its region.

00:11:44.667 --> 00:11:47.067
At the opening of our period,
cities like Alexandria and

00:11:47.067 --> 00:11:49.800
Antioch are extremely
important.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.933
Their importance within the
Byzantine Empire declines.

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:59.300
But in order to understand
that some of the internal

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.067
problems, we're going to have
to talk about heresies.

00:12:03.067 --> 00:12:05.433
I think I already apologized
for having to talk about

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:06.767
heresies, and I think I already

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:10.500
explained why it's important.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.300
Questions, remarks,
denunciations?

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.933
OK.

00:12:16.933 --> 00:12:20.533
Representatives of the
iconoclast defense fund want

00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:22.867
to claim equal time?

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:24.133
OK.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.667
This is just a selection
of heresies, right?

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:33.767
I mean, it's the proverbial
tip of the iceberg, the

00:12:33.767 --> 00:12:38.667
proverbial icing on the
cake, the proverbial--

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:40.267
what do you call it--

00:12:40.267 --> 00:12:42.900
crust on the chocolate
pudding.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:48.000
But having said that, these
two are what are called

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.800
Christological controversies.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:57.100
They're about the nature of
Christ. The relationship of

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.267
his human to divine nature.

00:13:00.267 --> 00:13:03.933
And, grossly, to oversimplify,
the Nestorians emphasize

00:13:03.933 --> 00:13:07.500
Christ's divine nature, and
the Monophysites, Christ's

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:07.933
human nature.

00:13:07.933 --> 00:13:08.100
[correction: the nestorians
emphasize Christ's human

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.067
nature; the Monophysites
His divine nature].

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:13.800
The beginning of this
controversy is with the

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:19.467
Nestorians, named after the
patriarch, Nestorius, the

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:22.433
bishop, Patriarch of
Constantinople.

00:13:32.633 --> 00:13:37.800
Nestorius seemed to teach --
and he's patriarch in the

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.333
420s, and the stories
would be deposed

00:13:42.333 --> 00:13:44.833
in for 431, as patriarch.

00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:52.600
His followers seemed to teach
that Christ was fully human

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.767
and that his divine nature was
either separate from is human

00:13:55.767 --> 00:14:04.433
nature, or it was nonexistent
or irrelevant.

00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:08.400
I should remind you that the
problem is posed by Christ

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:12.967
being God, and yet, being
crucified and

00:14:12.967 --> 00:14:14.700
suffering and dying.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:21.633
So this is a problem that,
logically, arises out of an

00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:27.400
understanding of who Christ is
and what he does for humanity.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.733
Nestorius was deposed by the
Third Ecumenical Council of

00:14:33.733 --> 00:14:35.000
Constantinople--

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.067
I'm sorry, the Third Ecumenical
Council, which

00:14:39.067 --> 00:14:46.567
meets in Ephesus, on the western
shore of Asia Minor.

00:14:46.567 --> 00:14:48.600
Council of Ephesus, Ecumenical
Council-- the

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.567
third one in 431.

00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:54.733
The first two had dealt
with Arianism.

00:14:54.733 --> 00:14:57.733
I remind you that Arianism is
a different problem, because

00:14:57.733 --> 00:15:00.067
it deals not with the nature
of Christ, but the

00:15:00.067 --> 00:15:03.300
relationship of Christ
to God the Father.

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.667
Here, we're now just
concentrating on Christ. The

00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:10.767
Monophysites, in opposing the
Nestorians, naturally

00:15:10.767 --> 00:15:15.100
emphasized Christ's divine
nature, as the Nestorians had,

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.733
in their opinion,

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:20.800
overemphasized the human nature.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.533
But from the point of view of
the group that we can call

00:15:25.533 --> 00:15:28.967
Orthodox, the people who
believe neither in

00:15:28.967 --> 00:15:32.900
Nestorianism nor Monophysitism,
both sides were

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:33.933
extremists.

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:37.833
The Monophysites over did
Christ's divine natures.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:48.500
If the Nestorians taught that
Christ had two nature's, a

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.900
kind of fully human one and a
fully divine one, that were

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.933
separate, the Monophysites
seemed to be teaching, or did

00:15:59.933 --> 00:16:04.967
teach, that Christ had
one nature, and that,

00:16:04.967 --> 00:16:07.267
essentially, divine.

00:16:07.267 --> 00:16:14.267
The relationship of the human
and divine natures in

00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:18.100
Monophysitism was denounced by
their opponents as if you

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.567
threw a bucket of water
into the ocean.

00:16:20.567 --> 00:16:23.267
The bucket of water representing
the human part.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:32.533
What's at stake in this, and
why it's important, is how

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:36.233
Christ saves people.

00:16:36.233 --> 00:16:41.933
If he is too human, then he's
just a human, elevated by God,

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:45.967
like some kind of ancient-world
hero.

00:16:45.967 --> 00:16:49.433
And he doesn't seem, then, to
have the power to save people

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:53.767
from the devil, hell, original
sin, all of these terrible

00:16:53.767 --> 00:16:59.367
things that God has saved the
followers of Christ from.

00:16:59.367 --> 00:17:03.933
If he's divine, completely
divine, then what's the point

00:17:03.933 --> 00:17:07.033
of distinguishing him
from God the Father?

00:17:07.033 --> 00:17:11.300
And then, how did he suffer
on the cross?

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.600
Was his suffering real?

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.500
Can God, with no human
elements, suffer?

00:17:24.967 --> 00:17:28.167
Questions about this so far?

00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:30.233
We understand the difference,
then?

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:32.800
And we, sort of, understand
what's at stake?

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.000
Sort of, because maybe
we are thinking--

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.600
I hope not, because you're not
in a medieval frame of mind,

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.367
if you're thinking this--

00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:43.533
You may be thinking, though,
none the less, "Well, why

00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:49.300
don't they just agree to
disagree?" Or something like,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.433
"Hey, you can believe in one
nature, I'll believe in two."

00:17:54.433 --> 00:17:57.367
Or, "You can believe in two
separate natures, I'll believe

00:17:57.367 --> 00:18:01.633
in two natures coexisting.

00:18:01.633 --> 00:18:09.533
And God will reward your
good intentions."

00:18:09.533 --> 00:18:13.267
That's really the problem, is
that we live in a society in

00:18:13.267 --> 00:18:17.300
which, at least, so
we may think.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:22.867
enlightened people don't really
impose their beliefs,

00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:24.833
in detail, on others.

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:31.033
We're not really interested
in theology that much.

00:18:31.033 --> 00:18:37.167
But the Bible, I've got to
admit, does say that it is

00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:39.967
important to have the
right belief.

00:18:39.967 --> 00:18:43.267
The Bible, particularly, but
not exclusively, the Old

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:46.633
Testament, is very bad on
rewarding good intentions.

00:18:50.567 --> 00:18:55.600
The further back you go in the
Bible, the less are good

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.533
intentions rewarded.

00:18:57.533 --> 00:18:59.533
Lot's wife was told
not to look back.

00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:00.267
She looked back.

00:19:00.267 --> 00:19:01.567
She was turned into
a pillar of salt.

00:19:01.567 --> 00:19:05.533
Nobody said, "Oh, OK, you didn't
mean to look back" or

00:19:05.533 --> 00:19:07.700
you know, "human weakness."
That's just it.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.667
Or the guy--

00:19:08.667 --> 00:19:11.167
now I'm betraying
my ignorance--

00:19:11.167 --> 00:19:16.900
who stumbles as they're carrying
the tabernacle back

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.000
to Jerusalem, from captivity
with the Philistines.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.167
Is it Usiah?

00:19:22.167 --> 00:19:24.400
Well, anyway, I shouldn't
get started on things

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.433
I'm not sure of.

00:19:25.433 --> 00:19:30.433
But the guy stumbles, and
God strikes him dead.

00:19:30.433 --> 00:19:32.300
He stumbled.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:35.600
Nobody asks him, "Oh, I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.067
stumble," or "a little rabbit
ran in front of me." He

00:19:39.067 --> 00:19:42.667
stumbles: he dies: that's it.

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:45.667
God wants you to understand
what's going on.

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:48.600
Insofar as you don't
make errors.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.133
Therefore, the right
understanding of Christ's

00:19:51.133 --> 00:19:52.933
nature is important.

00:19:52.933 --> 00:19:59.233
It's not just a matter of
convincing other people that

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:02.967
one band is better than another,
or one kind of game

00:20:02.967 --> 00:20:06.033
is better another, or one team
is better than another.

00:20:06.033 --> 00:20:09.333
It is crucial.

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:17.300
Gregory of Nyssa, himself a
theologian, writes, about 500

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:24.533
AD or so, that the mood of
theological controversy is so

00:20:24.533 --> 00:20:30.267
great, that if you go into a
shop, and you ask about your

00:20:30.267 --> 00:20:34.733
change, he says, the shopkeeper
philosophizes about

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:37.500
the begotten and
the unbegotten.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.500
If you inquire about a loaf of
bread, the baker will reply,

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.933
that the Son is inferior, and
the Father is superior.

00:20:43.933 --> 00:20:47.000
And if you ask if your bath is
ready, the attendant says that

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.167
the sun is made out
of nothing.

00:20:49.167 --> 00:20:53.700
Now, all of this is a satiric
remark about the way in which

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.033
ordinary people are caught up in
this religious controversy.

00:20:57.033 --> 00:20:59.333
It is not, exclusively,
a matter of

00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:02.900
intellectuals or clergy.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:05.567
But it's a political problem as
well, and that's the reason

00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:09.000
that it really preoccupies us.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.600
In the Council of Chalcedon
in 451-454.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:24.800
So Ephesus, 431, Chalcedon,
451 to 454.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.900
Chalcedon, also on the other
side of Constantinople on the

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.967
Asian side of what's
now Turkey.

00:21:32.967 --> 00:21:40.500
The Council of Chalcedon
denounced the Monophysites.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:46.033
It basically says that Christ
has two natures.

00:21:46.033 --> 00:21:49.567
They are both perfect,
they are indivisible,

00:21:49.567 --> 00:21:51.533
but they are separate.

00:21:51.533 --> 00:21:55.900
Two natures, one person,
one hypostasis.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.233
A "hypostasis" is a thing that
exists in its own right.

00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:11.600
This solution was suggested
by Rome, by the pope.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.467
The same Pope Leo
the Great, who'd

00:22:13.467 --> 00:22:14.800
negotiated with the Huns.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.667
The West had the advantage of
not experiencing these kinds

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:23.133
of controversies.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:28.333
And so Constantinople,
far more powerful

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:30.867
than Rome in the 450s--

00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:32.967
Rome, about to collapse
completely--

00:22:32.967 --> 00:22:37.500
nevertheless, is beholden to
Rome for, at least what would

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.833
be the majority solution, to the
problem of Monophysitism.

00:22:41.833 --> 00:22:46.067
Of course, actually, it's not
a solution, because not

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:49.900
everybody acknowledges the
Council of Chalcedon.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:56.300
It provokes a split.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.467
The Patriarch of Alexandria
would be the leader of those

00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:09.767
resisting the Council, and
Egypt, Syria, and, to some

00:23:09.767 --> 00:23:15.133
extent, Lebanon and Palestine,
would be Monophysite,

00:23:15.133 --> 00:23:16.367
steadfastly.

00:23:18.667 --> 00:23:22.567
Indeed, the survivors of
the Monophysites--

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:28.233
that is the modern-day
representatives of this part

00:23:28.233 --> 00:23:29.067
of Christianity--

00:23:29.067 --> 00:23:33.267
are the Copts, in Egypt, who
form ten percent of the

00:23:33.267 --> 00:23:35.133
population--

00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:38.367
Christian Monophysites--

00:23:38.367 --> 00:23:42.767
and the Christians of Ethiopia,
who form a little

00:23:42.767 --> 00:23:45.800
more than fifty percent of the
population of Ethiopia.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:50.800
The so-called Coptic Christians
are the descendants

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.767
of the Monophysites.

00:23:51.767 --> 00:23:55.933
The Nestorians also have some
scattered followers in the

00:23:55.933 --> 00:23:57.133
modern world.

00:23:57.133 --> 00:23:59.967
They were very strong
in Central Asia.

00:23:59.967 --> 00:24:03.700
And if you've studied things
like the voyages of Marco Polo

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.367
and other Western travelers in
the thirteenth century, the

00:24:07.367 --> 00:24:11.067
people who interpret for them,
who help them, who acquaint

00:24:11.067 --> 00:24:15.900
them with central Asia and the
Chinese Mongol Empire, are

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.200
Nestorians.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.400
But we're going to leave them
out, because they're not a

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.633
political problem for the
Byzantine Empire.

00:24:21.633 --> 00:24:24.000
They're, pretty much, exiled.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.900
The Copts are an internal
problem.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.600
And the Monophysites, or
Copts, do not like the

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.500
Orthodox, the Byzantine
Emperors.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.267
The Byzantine Emperors try
to compromise with them.

00:24:40.633 --> 00:24:43.600
And I'll mention a couple
of these compromises.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:59.267
The Emperor Zeno, from 474 to
491, issued a document called

00:24:59.267 --> 00:25:00.600
the Henotikon.

00:25:05.767 --> 00:25:08.300
We're back to emperors.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.967
As with-- we saw as far back
as Constantine, emperors

00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:14.000
trying to intervene
to solve religious

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
controversies, right?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.133
The Henotikon says, one of the
Trinity was incarnate, and

00:25:22.133 --> 00:25:25.833
we're not going to discuss
it anymore.

00:25:25.833 --> 00:25:29.967
So first, it says this rather
noncommittal statement: "One

00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:35.733
of the Trinity was incarnate."
And then it also outlaws any

00:25:35.733 --> 00:25:39.200
further discussion.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.500
Nobody liked this.

00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:47.800
Zeno was succeeded by
Anastasius, who was a

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.033
Monophysite.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.200
And then, as we'll see, the
great emperor of the sixth

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.433
century, Justinian, who we're
going to be looking at much

00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:09.267
more closely, was a fierce
anti-Monophysite or

00:26:09.267 --> 00:26:11.600
Chalcedonian, Orthodox.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.033
But his wife was, sort
of, semi-Monophysite.

00:26:15.033 --> 00:26:17.000
This may have been politic.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.833
Since they were both effective
rulers, the people who were

00:26:20.833 --> 00:26:24.300
Monophysite could orient
themselves to Theodora, the

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.100
Empress, and the Orthodox,
to Justinian.

00:26:30.933 --> 00:26:38.067
Ultimately, this problem would
be quote, "solved," because

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:42.333
the Arab Muslim invasion of the
seventh century would take

00:26:42.333 --> 00:26:44.133
over the Monophysite
territories.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.600
Again, I hope I'm not giving
away a secret, by saying that

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:58.967
the most striking, sweeping,
and dramatic event of

00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:04.800
Mediterranean world or of the
Eurasian land mass, of the

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.167
period that we're dealing
with, arguably,

00:27:07.167 --> 00:27:10.533
is the rise of Islam.

00:27:10.533 --> 00:27:18.467
Mohammed's Hegira is
in the 632-633--

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:19.633
I can't remember.

00:27:19.633 --> 00:27:22.000
Anybody know, off hand?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.400
Anyone want to look
it up, off hand?

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.100
H-E-G-I-R-A.

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.600
Student: 622.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.100
PROFESSOR: 622.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.967
622.

00:27:29.967 --> 00:27:38.567
By 660, Egypt, Syria, Palestine,
Lebanon have fallen

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:42.433
to Muslim rule.

00:27:42.433 --> 00:27:48.833
And they are extending their
power as far west as North

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:52.833
Africa and as far east
as Afghanistan.

00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:55.600
How this happens, why this
happens, is the subject for

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.933
discussion a little later.

00:27:56.933 --> 00:28:02.167
But again, if you refer to the
map in 600, this is before the

00:28:02.167 --> 00:28:03.367
Islamic takeover.

00:28:03.367 --> 00:28:06.800
And again, if you look further
east, the Eastern Roman Empire

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.167
consists of all these parts,
many of which are about to be

00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:11.400
taken away from it.

00:28:15.567 --> 00:28:19.267
And the parts that were taken
away from it were pretty much

00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:21.200
the Monophysite parts.

00:28:26.767 --> 00:28:32.067
So the fifth century is the
story of the survival of the

00:28:32.067 --> 00:28:35.533
Eastern Roman Empire, despite
these religious controversies.

00:28:35.533 --> 00:28:37.867
The early sixth century, which
we'll talk about in more

00:28:37.867 --> 00:28:43.800
detail, is the story of the
expansion of the Empire to

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.867
make a stab at reuniting, by
conquering the West, what had

00:28:47.867 --> 00:28:51.600
been the single Roman Empire.

00:28:56.267 --> 00:29:03.633
Justinian's empire was
overextended at least in

00:29:03.633 --> 00:29:04.967
retrospect.

00:29:04.967 --> 00:29:10.067
This is a reconquest that, at
least, consultants from a

00:29:10.067 --> 00:29:12.867
later generation would have
said was a mistake, an

00:29:12.867 --> 00:29:23.800
overexpansion Initially, the
main enemy of the Byzantine

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.567
Empire, after Justinian--

00:29:25.567 --> 00:29:29.100
so in the late sixth century,
early seven century--

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.367
would be Persia.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.333
But also, at the same time,
the Byzantine Empire would

00:29:40.333 --> 00:29:45.667
start experiencing Danubian
frontier incursions, attacks

00:29:45.667 --> 00:29:46.900
from the Balkans.

00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:50.667
And here again, as
I said, it's all

00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:53.467
invaders and heresies.

00:29:53.467 --> 00:29:58.300
Invasions from Slavs and Avars
in the Balkans, and the

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.100
Persians

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:17.300
in the East. OK.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:26.167
In 591, a revolution toppled
the Persian ruler, who,

00:30:26.167 --> 00:30:30.267
peculiarly enough, fled to
Byzantium for refuge, where

00:30:30.267 --> 00:30:38.967
the Emperor Maurice helped
him gain his throne back.

00:30:38.967 --> 00:30:43.533
In 591, there was a peace
between Persia and Byzantium,

00:30:43.533 --> 00:30:47.833
and Byzantium seemed to have
come out of this terrible

00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:51.000
period of warfare of the
late sixth century.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.200
This allowed Maurice to turn
his attention to his other

00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:02.400
front, his Western- Northern
front, where the Avars were a

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.267
tremendous threat to him.

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:10.167
The Avars, a central Asiatic
people, who come in through

00:31:10.167 --> 00:31:11.900
Central Asia into the Balkans.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:16.667
And they carry with them, to
some extent, the Slavs. The

00:31:16.667 --> 00:31:19.667
conventional portrayal used to
be that the Avars sort of lead

00:31:19.667 --> 00:31:22.733
the Slavs; the latter
are kind of passive.

00:31:22.733 --> 00:31:25.900
It's a little more complicated
than that.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:31.867
The Avars had taken the great
cities of the Balkans.

00:31:31.867 --> 00:31:36.433
And in 492, Maurice turns to
deal with them, to push them

00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:37.900
back against the Danube.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:44.067
His army rebels against
him, and he's

00:31:44.067 --> 00:31:45.333
overthrown and killed.

00:31:48.333 --> 00:31:52.033
The beginning of the seventh
century is the period of the

00:31:52.033 --> 00:31:55.667
maximum danger of Byzantium.

00:31:55.667 --> 00:32:00.233
It lasts, with intermittent
flashes, from 602, the

00:32:00.233 --> 00:32:04.100
overthrow of Maurice, to
717, the Arab Siege of

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:05.333
Constantinople.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:15.467
Immediately, this new emperor,
Phocas, is attacked by Persia.

00:32:15.467 --> 00:32:19.400
The Persian King claiming to
revenge the murder of his

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.933
benefactor, but, in fact, simply
reopening the war with

00:32:22.933 --> 00:32:24.200
Constantinople.

00:32:27.967 --> 00:32:44.400
In 608-609, the Persians and the
Avars are allied, and the

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.200
Persians are really
on the march.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.733
By 617, they have taken Egypt,
they have taken Syria, they

00:32:50.733 --> 00:32:54.800
have taken in Jerusalem, and
the relic of the Holy Cross

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.500
has been taken back to
the Persian capital.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:08.700
The emperor, at this time,
Heraclius, whom Wickham is not

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.000
very impressed by, admittedly.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.800
Heraclius leads a resistance,
as does the patriarch, to a

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:23.300
siege that is on both sides of
the city of Constantinople.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.633
On the one side, the land side,
the Theodosian Walls,

00:33:26.633 --> 00:33:30.267
are the Avars and the Slavs
on the Bosporus.

00:33:30.267 --> 00:33:33.633
Across the city, on the
Asian side of the

00:33:33.633 --> 00:33:36.100
Bosporus, are the Persians.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:41.300
And what Heraclius does, is to
confide the city in the care

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:45.633
of the patriarch, and go
off and attack the

00:33:45.633 --> 00:33:48.633
Persians from the rear.

00:33:48.633 --> 00:33:51.967
The patriarch defends the city,
not only by organizing

00:33:51.967 --> 00:33:56.500
the army, but by putting
wonder-working icons on the

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.667
walls, to face the enemy.

00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:04.200
An icon is a painting
of a sacred figure.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.000
So then, it is not a statue,
but a painting.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:14.233
And it portrays a saint or Mary
or Christ. And in what

00:34:14.233 --> 00:34:17.667
has come to be called the
Orthodox tradition, these

00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:23.200
remain today, a figure of the
church, a very distinct kind

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:29.800
of aspect of the piety
of the East.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.800
The Church -- patriarch ordered
that the Church melt

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:36.167
down all of the treasures that
had been given to it, to

00:34:36.167 --> 00:34:38.667
decorate it, in order
to pay for troops.

00:34:41.467 --> 00:34:47.267
So the combination of the icons,
the money, the spirit

00:34:47.267 --> 00:34:54.033
of the populous, and military
means were able to withstand

00:34:54.033 --> 00:34:56.667
this prolonged siege--

00:34:56.667 --> 00:34:59.833
at times a double siege-- of the
Persians on one side, the

00:34:59.833 --> 00:35:03.067
Avars and the Slavs
on the other side.

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:07.267
After many years of fighting
in the East, Heraclius

00:35:07.267 --> 00:35:10.233
succeeded in overthrowing
the Persians.

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:16.567
At the battle of Nineveh
in 627--

00:35:16.567 --> 00:35:19.100
this is a seventeen-year
war or so.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.000
I'm sorry, Nineveh--

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
E-H.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.900
Heraclius defeats the Persians,
and the Persian

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.200
Empire is virtually crippled.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.500
627--

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:49.233
Byzantium would have seemed to
of have been triumphant.

00:35:49.233 --> 00:35:53.200
The first Arab attacks, however,
were in 634, twelve

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.233
years after Mohammed's Hegira.

00:35:59.133 --> 00:36:04.500
By 636, Syria had been taken;
by 638 Jerusalem had been

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.300
taken; and the True
Cross, again--

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:11.100
in this case, we lose
sight of it.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.600
Persia, itself, would
collapse in 640 and

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.067
pass under Arab rule.

00:36:23.167 --> 00:36:29.833
Egypt would fall in 645.

00:36:29.833 --> 00:36:34.533
What's left of the
Empire, then, is

00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:37.700
the Balkans and Anatolia--

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:42.100
some Armenian, some
Slavic elements.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:47.933
So weak is this empire, so beset
by enemies, does it seem

00:36:47.933 --> 00:36:53.333
to be, that a successor of
Heraclius, the emperor

00:36:53.333 --> 00:37:03.300
Constans II, moved the capital
to Sicily, to the West.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:07.167
Constans II ruled
from Syracuse--

00:37:07.167 --> 00:37:09.667
Syracuse, Sicily, obviously--

00:37:09.667 --> 00:37:10.933
the original Syracuse.

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.900
He would be the last emperor
to visit Rome.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:24.833
And he was, actually,
the first since 476.

00:37:24.833 --> 00:37:29.767
So in 662, when he moved the
capital to Sicily, we have the

00:37:29.767 --> 00:37:35.500
spectacle of a kind of ghost
emperor visiting a ghost city.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:41.967
Visit of Constans II to Rome,
and the severe crisis of the

00:37:41.967 --> 00:37:46.967
Eastern Empire beset, as it was
now, particularly, but not

00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:49.167
exclusively, by the Arabs.

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:52.733
And indeed, in 674, the Arab
fleet appeared off

00:37:52.733 --> 00:37:55.500
Constantinople.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:00.567
In 678, we hear, for the first
time, of the weapon of the

00:38:00.567 --> 00:38:04.800
Greeks against the
Arab fleets--

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.500
a weapon called "Greek fire."

00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:10.667
Greek fire is some kind
of flaming projectile.

00:38:10.667 --> 00:38:13.900
In other words, something that
you can shoot with a catapult,

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:16.267
or some other propulsion
device, that

00:38:16.267 --> 00:38:18.267
will burst into flame.

00:38:18.267 --> 00:38:21.200
Obviously, you can't launch it
if it's already burning.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.233
You have to have something
that--This is the essence of

00:38:28.233 --> 00:38:30.167
basic bomb throwing--

00:38:30.167 --> 00:38:37.267
you have to have something that
will explode on impact.

00:38:37.267 --> 00:38:42.267
The Greek fire was,
particularly, effective on

00:38:42.267 --> 00:38:44.633
wooden ships and on
rigging and sails.

00:38:44.633 --> 00:38:47.267
It would set the
ships on fire.

00:38:47.267 --> 00:38:51.367
And it's a weapon that seems to
have been unique, at least

00:38:51.367 --> 00:38:52.900
for awhile, to the Byzantines

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:56.533
But, parenthetically, how was it
that the Arabs have a navy,

00:38:56.533 --> 00:38:57.867
in the first place?

00:38:57.867 --> 00:39:01.733
These people, who decades
before, had never seen a river

00:39:01.733 --> 00:39:06.867
that flowed all year long, who
had no experience with the

00:39:06.867 --> 00:39:09.933
sea, for whom the desert
was the sea.

00:39:09.933 --> 00:39:13.667
It is an example of this kind
of very rapid adaptability

00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:15.433
that we'll emphasize,
when we come to talk

00:39:15.433 --> 00:39:16.900
about the Islamic invasion.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.100
The East did survive
even this attack.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.433
The seventh century--
we will be dealing

00:39:27.433 --> 00:39:28.600
with in more detail--

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:30.567
is a crucial turning point.

00:39:30.567 --> 00:39:33.600
By this time, the Eastern Roman
Empire we're talking

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:39.367
about as the East is pretty
much a Greek empire.

00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:44.033
Justinian would be the last
emperor to speak Latin.

00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:48.200
And the truncation of the
empire, with the loss of Egypt

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.433
and the Near East, means that
it is pretty much a Greek

00:39:52.433 --> 00:39:57.300
empire and, also, pretty much
an Orthodox empire.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:01.500
Orthodoxy is the Christian
faith that stands between

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.567
Nestorianism and
Monophysitism.

00:40:04.567 --> 00:40:07.867
For the time, the Orthodox
world, in the East, and the

00:40:07.867 --> 00:40:10.667
Catholic world, in the
West, are the same.

00:40:10.667 --> 00:40:13.967
Their official break won't
come until 1054.

00:40:13.967 --> 00:40:19.267
And as you know, to this day,
the Orthodox churches of

00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:25.500
Russia, Greece, and so forth,
look very different.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:30.500
And they also have certain
doctrinal differences with the

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:33.933
West. And that's not our
subject, for the time being.

00:40:33.933 --> 00:40:36.933
We do have, however, before
the close of business, one

00:40:36.933 --> 00:40:38.000
more heresy.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.467
A heresy that starts to divide
the Byzantine Empire in the

00:40:42.467 --> 00:40:47.067
late seventh century, and
that is iconoclasm.

00:40:47.067 --> 00:40:51.067
Iconoclasm, which Wickham talks
about in some detail,

00:40:51.067 --> 00:40:54.100
and which he tells us
to take seriously.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:59.067
What he means by that, is that
iconoclasm seems to be

00:40:59.067 --> 00:41:02.500
something that must not be about
what it seems to be.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.667
It's got to be about
something else.

00:41:06.667 --> 00:41:11.300
Iconoclasm is the belief that
images, like icons, in

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.033
particular, are dangerous.

00:41:14.033 --> 00:41:18.167
And that they lead to
inappropriate worship of the

00:41:18.167 --> 00:41:20.567
image, rather than what
the image symbolizes.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:31.033
So the iconoclasts believe in
banning images of persons.

00:41:31.033 --> 00:41:37.400
A cross is fine but not
a picture of a saint.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.533
Even, in some circles,
pictures of

00:41:39.533 --> 00:41:42.000
Christ would be suspect.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.833
The danger of this reverence
paid to icons, is that the

00:41:46.833 --> 00:41:52.000
icons then, becomes a sacred
thing in itself, and you've

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.433
fallen into idolatry.

00:41:53.433 --> 00:41:58.467
You're worshipping multiple
representatives of the divine.

00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:05.767
Now it certainly seems logical
that this must have something

00:42:05.767 --> 00:42:07.867
to do with Islam.

00:42:07.867 --> 00:42:16.433
Because Islam, in its most
monotheist manifestations,

00:42:16.433 --> 00:42:23.600
frowns on and bans the
representation of purportedly

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.133
divine figures.

00:42:25.133 --> 00:42:29.533
And it, indeed, doesn't like
figural representation at all,

00:42:29.533 --> 00:42:31.600
in decoration of
sacred spaces.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.300
Lest this be interpreted as
exalting figures, even the

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.567
Prophet -- especially
the Prophet himself.

00:42:44.567 --> 00:42:49.667
There are no pictures of
Muhammad for home consumption,

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:51.033
for mosque display.

00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:56.733
And so it seems logical that
this is a response to

00:42:56.733 --> 00:43:03.600
criticism from Islam, that
Christianity is really not

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.100
monotheist, that it's a form of
idolatry, because it has so

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:07.833
many sacred figures.

00:43:07.833 --> 00:43:10.767
And that the success of Islam
and the success of the Arabs

00:43:10.767 --> 00:43:16.533
against Byzantium, might be
caused by the abandonment of

00:43:16.533 --> 00:43:17.900
monotheism--

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.433
the abandonment of the worship
of one god and the

00:43:21.433 --> 00:43:23.200
proliferation of
multiple gods.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:26.100
The problem is that there's
no real evidence of this.

00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:34.667
And you don't have to
have Islam to force

00:43:34.667 --> 00:43:36.167
this kind of thing.

00:43:36.167 --> 00:43:40.667
If you look around the churches
of much of Northern

00:43:40.667 --> 00:43:45.233
Europe, you will see statues
that have been decapitated by

00:43:45.233 --> 00:43:50.000
Protestants, in the sixteenth
and seventeenth century, or

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.133
stained glass that was destroyed
by Protestants.

00:43:54.133 --> 00:43:58.633
Protestantism is iconoclastic in
many of its forms, in that

00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:02.167
it believed that the Catholic
Church was superstitious, paid

00:44:02.167 --> 00:44:05.900
reverence to all of these saints
and human figures, and

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:11.000
forgot, in the process, to
concentrate on the single God.

00:44:13.967 --> 00:44:19.333
Iconoclasm is a crisis
of the empire.

00:44:19.333 --> 00:44:24.700
It is also, like these other
heresies, a recurrence of this

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.733
problem of how to represent the
connection between God and

00:44:28.733 --> 00:44:30.000
human beings.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.667
What connects the divine
with the humans?

00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:36.000
Are there intermediaries?

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.233
Is Christ an intermediary,
or is he God?

00:44:39.233 --> 00:44:43.433
And if he's God, how is
there intermediation?

00:44:43.433 --> 00:44:44.767
Why does God care about us?

00:44:44.767 --> 00:44:46.467
How does God care about us?

00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:50.933
How many ways are there
to approach him?

00:44:55.933 --> 00:44:58.833
It took until 843 to settle
this controversy.

00:44:58.833 --> 00:45:01.467
It had many periods of
settlement and then a

00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:03.533
recrudescence.

00:45:03.533 --> 00:45:05.833
It's a controversy that lasts,
then, something on the order

00:45:05.833 --> 00:45:08.733
of 150, 160 years.

00:45:08.733 --> 00:45:10.400
At times, it divides the Empire

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.700
completely, at times not.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.133
It tends to be supported
by the emperor.

00:45:16.133 --> 00:45:17.500
If the emperor isn't

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.167
iconoclastic, it tends to wane.

00:45:20.167 --> 00:45:22.600
It's supported by the emperors,
partly, as a way of

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:27.467
trying to unify and mobilize the
Empire around the figure

00:45:27.467 --> 00:45:30.667
of the emperor, instead of
dissipating the energies

00:45:30.667 --> 00:45:35.533
around the various
saintly figures.

00:45:35.533 --> 00:45:39.433
So where are we, with this
empire, that seems to consist

00:45:39.433 --> 00:45:45.767
of only sieges and barbarian
peoples and heresies?

00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:49.767
In the ninth century, it would
seem that the cities, with the

00:45:49.767 --> 00:45:53.900
exception of Constantinople
itself, had declined to become

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.567
little more than fortresses.

00:45:56.567 --> 00:45:59.567
We seem to be at the end of
classical antiquity, in some

00:45:59.567 --> 00:46:02.433
fundamental way, of that
society built around

00:46:02.433 --> 00:46:05.167
Mediterranean cities.

00:46:05.167 --> 00:46:09.800
Society even here, as in
the West, is rural.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.600
There's not a whole
lot of trade.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.100
There still are libraries, with
books in them, but they

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.867
don't seem to be
read very much.

00:46:16.867 --> 00:46:20.300
We have very few texts
from this era.

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:23.900
It's a militarized society.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:25.800
It's an intensely
religious one.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.000
There's very little secular
literature--

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.600
really at the end of Greco-Roman
Pagan knowledge.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:41.800
As it happens, however, this
period would usher in an era

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:48.100
of surprising, at least in
retrospect, prosperity for the

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.833
Byzantine Empire.

00:46:50.833 --> 00:46:53.400
And we will be talking
about that later.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.000
On Wednesday, we're going
to discuss the reign of

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.033
Justinian, through Procopius,
as a thing, in itself.

00:47:02.033 --> 00:47:05.400
And then, we will turn to the
post-Roman world of the West,

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:07.733
subsequently.

00:47:07.733 --> 00:47:08.967
Thanks very much.

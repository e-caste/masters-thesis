00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.250
Prof: Today we are going
to look at three cantos.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.791
They are connected in a number
of interesting ways:

00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:16.260
Cantos IX, X,
and XI.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.510
They describe--they focus on
the pilgrim and the guide,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.720
Virgil, being--approaching the
city of Dis.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.830
So we are moving--they are
moving and we with them,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.690
away from the area of
incontinence,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.169
which is the section of
Inferno we read through

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:42.620
from Canto V to Canto VIII.
 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.182
They are approaching the gates
of the city of Dis in Canto IX

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:52.633
and the pilgrim experiences a
serious impediment,

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.600
an impasse, we will call it.
 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.230
He cannot go any further.
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.914
The guidance of Virgil fails
him and we are going to examine

00:01:01.914 --> 00:01:05.724
why it fails him and what is the
problem that the pilgrim will

00:01:05.724 --> 00:01:06.849
have to solve.
 

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:09.828
Once he is in canto--within the
city of Dis,

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:15.489
the first sinners he meets are
the so-called heretics,

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:19.040
heresiarchs,
among whom--chief among whom is

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.739
really Epicurus,
the Epicureans,

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:26.256
and in many ways you understand
already that link between the

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:28.590
city and these philosophers.
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
Let me just add one thing so
you have--

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.372
the idea is a bit clearer:
Dante acknowledges in this

00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:39.592
philosophical text that he
writes called the Banquet

00:01:39.592 --> 00:01:41.920
three schools of philosophy.
 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.929
The so-called academics or
Aristotelians,

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:50.340
then the Stoics,
and the third Epicureans;

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.387
now he handles--he just
examines who these Epicureans

00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:58.900
are and for him they appear as
those who are guilty of some

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.185
form of pride,
if you wish,

00:02:01.185 --> 00:02:04.406
intellectual pride,
since heresy is a question of

00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:08.229
intellect and not of will,
we'll talk about that.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.580
They deny the immortality of
the soul, and in fact,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.599
it's really a problem to figure
out why should Dante think of

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.408
them as sinners at all.
 

00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:23.229
In antiquity they were viewed
as one more school of opinion,

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.438
a philosophical opinion:
my mind does not convince me,

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:29.919
my reason does not find it
convincing the belief in the

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.530
immorality of the soul.
 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.658
Why should I be punished?
 

00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:37.637
It's intellect,
since the logic of Dante's own

00:02:37.637 --> 00:02:43.609
idea of sinfulness is that the
will has to be involved,

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.139
the will is at the center of
the habit to sin.

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.873
We'll talk about this,
then in Canto XI,

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:56.128
there really is no great
action.

00:02:56.128 --> 00:03:02.567
Dante goes on explaining the
so-called topography of evil,

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:07.650
goes on explaining the
arrangement of sins.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.280
What is the principle of
construction of Inferno?

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.270
There now he turns to
Aristotle, we'll turn to

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.860
Aristotle's Ethics first
of all as the plan,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.043
as the model to--for the
arrangement of sins and then

00:03:21.043 --> 00:03:24.409
also we shall see in a very
interesting way he will turn

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.954
to--
he will allude to his

00:03:26.954 --> 00:03:28.520
Physics.
 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.937
You see he goes on talking
about--from a personal problem

00:03:33.937 --> 00:03:38.098
which we have to understand in
Canto IX,

00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:40.633
the crisis of,
then the questions of the

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:43.560
intellect and its relationship
to the will;

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.772
and then in Canto XI this idea
of what are the dispositions to

00:03:47.772 --> 00:03:51.710
sinfulness and we shall see--and
the turn to Aristotle.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:58.485
Let me go back to--now looking
at exactly the crisis of Canto

00:03:58.485 --> 00:04:03.229
IX, Dante's progressing in this
journey.

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:08.825
He reaches the gate of Dis and
now--this is around lines 40 and

00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:09.908
following.
 

00:04:09.908 --> 00:04:13.978
Three Furies,
the so-called three Erinyes of

00:04:13.978 --> 00:04:17.196
Greek mythology:
Alecto, Tesiphone,

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:18.709
and Megaera.
 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.870
They appear and they stop him.
 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.704
They say you cannot go into the
city, a city described very much

00:04:26.704 --> 00:04:27.649
as a medieval city.
 

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:37.220
In fact, it's a kind of swamp
for reasons that we--

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.314
having nothing to do with
really ecology but the idea that

00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:43.463
medieval cities were built near
swamps because the land was

00:04:43.463 --> 00:04:46.829
always more malleable and there
was water clearly in the--

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:51.607
that's not the reason for Dante
but the reason for the certain

00:04:51.607 --> 00:04:54.740
ways of understanding medieval
cities.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.016
The three Furies,
Alecto, Tisiphone,

00:04:58.016 --> 00:05:03.822
and Megaera will stop and they
call on Medusa who doesn't come,

00:05:03.822 --> 00:05:06.350
but they summon Medusa.
 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.829
That's why they say,
"let Medusa come."

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:12.723
They threaten the pilgrim,
with the sight of the Medusa,

00:05:12.723 --> 00:05:15.769
"let Medusa come,"
she isn't here,

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:16.689
I repeat.
 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.959
This is--if you had to
translate it into let's say from

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:25.069
English into Italian you would
use a subjunctive,

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.430
"may she come,
I wish she came,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.059
we wish she came,
let her come and we will turn

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:32.259
him to stone."
 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:34.569
That's the threat.
 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.600
A threat of petrifaction,
because according to the myth,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.920
and if you don't know all of it
for instance,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.139
you may have seen a movie about
the Medusa,

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.589
if you look at the--if you gaze
at the face of the Medusa,

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:53.028
one who gazes at the head of
the Medusa who was a great

00:05:53.028 --> 00:05:56.379
virginal beauty,
a vestal in the Temple of

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:58.670
Neptune, according to the myth.
 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.855
It was violated by Neptune and
Minerva takes revenge on her by

00:06:02.855 --> 00:06:06.836
metamorphosing her into this
ugly repulsive figure with her

00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:10.680
hair turned into snakes and yet
she has this power,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.839
this magic power of turning all
the onlookers into stone.

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.430
That's the threat.
 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.769
"Let Medusa come and we
will turn him to stone they all

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:21.959
cried looking down.
 

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:26.257
We avenged ill,
the assault of Theseus,"

00:06:26.257 --> 00:06:32.019
Theseus who also violated the
boundaries of Hell to free the

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:34.300
Eurytus,
another little story that there

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.939
were--
Theseus was successful in the

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:38.850
liberation of Eurytus.
 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:49.649
The drama involving the pilgrim
directly, this is a menace on

00:06:49.649 --> 00:06:50.730
him.
 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.639
"Turn thy back,"
this is Virgil who intervenes,

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.884
"and keep thine eyes shut,
for should the Gorgon"

00:06:57.884 --> 00:07:01.355
the Medusa,
"show herself and thou see

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:04.759
her there would be no returning
above."

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:07.069
And now that's the turn.
 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:09.319
Listen to this:
"My Master said this,

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:13.827
and himself turned me round
and, not trusting to my own

00:07:13.827 --> 00:07:17.415
hands,
covered my face with his own

00:07:17.415 --> 00:07:18.629
also."
 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:23.877
The poet interrupts the
narrative and talks to us as a

00:07:23.877 --> 00:07:24.569
poet.
 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:28.870
This is the first so-called
address to the reader.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.259
I will talk about this little
technical detail.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:33.687
That is to say,
this is no longer part of the

00:07:33.687 --> 00:07:36.014
action,
now it's no longer the pilgrim,

00:07:36.014 --> 00:07:39.196
the story of the pilgrim,
but the poet who is sitting in

00:07:39.196 --> 00:07:41.910
his study and who says,
"you who are of good

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.069
understanding,"
the Italian says,

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:46.220
"you who have healthy
intellect,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.250
who you have a good an
understanding,

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.355
note the teaching that is
hidden under the veil of the

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.060
strange lines."
 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.906
The poet assuming authority
turns to us readers,

00:07:57.906 --> 00:08:01.427
and in a sense,
he needs readers so that his

00:08:01.427 --> 00:08:05.439
authority can be constituted and
he warns us.

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:09.750
He admonishes us,
to engage in what clearly

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.959
appears is as an allegorical
operation.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.954
We have to read,
and the language is the

00:08:15.954 --> 00:08:17.129
language of allegory.
 

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:21.607
We have to know how to read
underneath the veil of language,

00:08:21.607 --> 00:08:24.870
there's something hidden
underneath this.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.709
What is the allegory about?
 

00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:32.139
Let me just give you more about
the story of the myth of the

00:08:32.139 --> 00:08:34.690
Medusa,
so you will see the relevance

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:39.955
maybe of that myth and the--
what I left out of the myth to

00:08:39.955 --> 00:08:41.408
this scene.
 

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:43.780
As you know,
the Medusa will be conquered,

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.879
will be defeated.
 

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:51.591
She will be defeated by the
poet, by Perseus who--it's the

00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:56.418
origin of Pegasus,
the horse of poetry.

00:08:56.418 --> 00:08:59.004
Pegasus--I'm sorry,
Perseus who,

00:08:59.004 --> 00:09:03.787
using the shield of Minerva--
the shield Minerva had given

00:09:03.787 --> 00:09:07.320
him--and by looking not at
Medusa directly,

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.177
at her face directly,
but at a reflected image in

00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:12.013
this shield,
in a mirror,

00:09:12.013 --> 00:09:16.629
the shield of Minerva,
manages to see her and will

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:21.080
kill, he will slay the Medusa in
the story.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.466
Within the Ovidian narrative,
this is clearly a means to

00:09:25.466 --> 00:09:30.333
evoke for us the need for a kind
of--not a direct vision but a

00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:31.928
mediated vision.
 

00:09:31.928 --> 00:09:34.721
That is to say,
through the mediation of poetry

00:09:34.721 --> 00:09:36.643
for us,
for the mediation of--I'll come

00:09:36.643 --> 00:09:39.678
back to the scene in a moment,
but through the mediation of

00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:42.320
the shield can Perseus really
take flight,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.149
kill and then take flight on
the back of Pegasus.

00:09:46.149 --> 00:09:48.879
For us, the shield of Minerva
is the text,

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:52.570
because at this point there is
a sort of direct--

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:58.782
let's say, divergence between
what the pilgrim is enjoined to

00:09:58.782 --> 00:09:59.298
do.
 

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:02.168
Virgil says to him,
"don't look,

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:05.019
shut your eyes,"
and not trusting the pilgrim,

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:08.525
either his quickness,
he must have been awed by this

00:10:08.525 --> 00:10:10.423
situation--
such a situation he doesn't

00:10:10.423 --> 00:10:10.870
understand.
 

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:15.600
He covers, Virgil covers,
the pilgrim's own eyes.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.389
In turn, the poet addresses us
and tells us to open our eyes.

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:22.418
You open your eyes and look.
 

00:10:22.418 --> 00:10:25.700
You can because you have the
shield of Minerva.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:30.409
You have this textual mediation
that will allow you to escape

00:10:30.409 --> 00:10:33.629
the direct threat and glance of
Medusa.

00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:38.669
So you do know that the story
Mercury, who is the messenger,

00:10:38.669 --> 00:10:42.600
that clearly--the figure of the
interpreter.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.735
That's what the messenger
means, the bearer of messages,

00:10:46.735 --> 00:10:48.389
the bearer of words.
 

00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:53.508
He comes and manages to make a
breach within the wall of the

00:10:53.508 --> 00:10:58.019
city and the pilgrim and the
guide can continue their

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:59.059
descent.
 

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.610
This is really the story.
 

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.759
What is happening?
 

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:05.169
What--how do I--can we explain?
 

00:11:05.169 --> 00:11:06.629
What is this allegory?
 

00:11:06.629 --> 00:11:09.669
Let me say a few things so that
you can understand the whole

00:11:09.669 --> 00:11:11.009
technique of allegories.
 

00:11:11.009 --> 00:11:12.330
Whenever you read the Divine
Comedy,

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.178
probably much more than I would
ever do,

00:11:15.178 --> 00:11:19.120
other scholars will tell you
that the Divine Comedy is

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.570
a vision,
which it is,

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.269
and that it's allegorical which
at times it is,

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:26.697
and the allegory is supposed to
explain everything that the

00:11:26.697 --> 00:11:29.178
pilgrim finds himself lost in
the woods.

00:11:29.178 --> 00:11:31.340
That's not the woods--to me
it's the woods,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.857
but they say it's a state of
sin in a way and there he meets

00:11:36.857 --> 00:11:40.320
three beasts that stand for
pride,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.328
and wrath, and what not;
they're three beasts and they

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.678
may stand for other things.
 

00:11:44.678 --> 00:11:47.297
The significance of that
initial landscape,

00:11:47.297 --> 00:11:50.724
as you may recall when we
talked about that scene is not

00:11:50.724 --> 00:11:53.840
all that clear and that's part
of the problem.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.447
That's what I call the land of
unlikeness within which the

00:11:57.447 --> 00:11:59.220
pilgrim will find himself.
 

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:04.548
The inability to join together
signs and their significations,

00:12:04.548 --> 00:12:07.581
the awareness that there are no
signs which are so

00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:10.984
self-transparent as to be
understood or de-codified in a

00:12:10.984 --> 00:12:12.159
particular way.
 

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:14.048
What is this idea of allegory?
 

00:12:14.048 --> 00:12:17.517
Dante here is clearly
asking--telling us that it is an

00:12:17.517 --> 00:12:18.759
allegory at work.
 

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:23.558
'You readers have good
understanding of healthy minds

00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:28.635
look, open your eyes and look
underneath the veil of the

00:12:28.635 --> 00:12:30.389
strange verse.'
 

00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:32.090
Why are they so strange?
 

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:32.950
What's so strange?
 

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.120
What is the story?
 

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.090
What's going on here?
 

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.730
What is allegory first of all?
 

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:40.961
Allegory, as you know,
the word means to speak

00:12:40.961 --> 00:12:42.090
otherwise.
 

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.844
It's a figure but it
related--but not quite,

00:12:45.844 --> 00:12:50.732
to enigmas within the manuals,
the primers of--rhetorical

00:12:50.732 --> 00:12:54.750
primers from medieval and
classical times.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:58.042
Enigmas, irony,
when you say one thing and you

00:12:58.042 --> 00:13:00.163
mean another,
but to say this,

00:13:00.163 --> 00:13:04.918
is to say very little because
Dante has been very thoughtful.

00:13:04.918 --> 00:13:09.211
He has been probing this issue
very deeply, and in a couple of

00:13:09.211 --> 00:13:10.759
places in his works.
 

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:13.985
In the Letter to Cangrande that
he writes, about which I will

00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:17.210
talk later--it's a letter that
he sends as an introduction to

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:19.629
the first ten cantos of
Paradise,

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:23.508
Cangrande being the lord of
Verona where Dante had lived for

00:13:23.508 --> 00:13:24.100
awhile.
 

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:28.279
And also in the Banquet,
this philosophical text where

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:31.693
he explores the idea of
what--how a meaning can be

00:13:31.693 --> 00:13:32.740
arrived at.
 

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.139
I have a statement.
 

00:13:34.139 --> 00:13:37.922
How can I go on drawing a
particular significance,

00:13:37.922 --> 00:13:41.860
or more than one significance
out of a statement?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.820
He distinguishes two types of
allegory.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:49.470
And there is a so-called
allegory of poets and allegory

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:51.250
of theologians.
 

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:54.379
How does he distinguish them?
 

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:56.740
How would he ask us to
distinguish between them?

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.467
The allegory of poets is an
allegory where the literal in

00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:05.860
which, the literal sense is a
fable, is a fiction.

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:11.897
To say, that's the example he
gives, Orpheus by the power of

00:14:11.897 --> 00:14:17.730
his language moved stones,
that's an allegory of poets.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:23.186
It really means that the power
of the voice of the poet manages

00:14:23.186 --> 00:14:27.586
maybe to edify cities,
whether we need poetic myths

00:14:27.586 --> 00:14:30.580
for the edification of a city.
 

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.350
That's understandable.
 

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.716
Or to say Orpheus,
that by the power of his words,

00:14:35.716 --> 00:14:36.678
tamed lions.
 

00:14:36.678 --> 00:14:40.259
It's to say that whatever
ferociousness we may have inside

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:43.087
us can partly be tamed by the
music, the song,

00:14:43.087 --> 00:14:44.909
the poetry, and so forth.
 

00:14:44.909 --> 00:14:46.970
That's the allegory of poets.
 

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.980
The literal sense is a fiction.
 

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.480
To say that it's an allegory of
theologians is completely

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.230
different.
 

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:57.711
The example that Dante gives is
taken--sends us to Exodus,

00:14:57.711 --> 00:15:00.149
the biblical story of Exodus.
 

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.482
You all know,
I take, what the biblical story

00:15:02.482 --> 00:15:04.178
is, so once again movies help.
 

00:15:04.178 --> 00:15:07.905
The biblical story of Exodus,
the story where the Jews

00:15:07.905 --> 00:15:10.746
abandon,
leave the bondage,

00:15:10.746 --> 00:15:16.327
the slavery of Egypt,
go through the desert and reach

00:15:16.327 --> 00:15:18.129
the Promised Land.
 

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:22.129
This is happening historically,
it's true.

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:25.668
This is not a fiction,
this is--the Red Sea did open

00:15:25.668 --> 00:15:28.861
up and the Jews could pass
through the Red Sea,

00:15:28.861 --> 00:15:31.428
could cross the Red Sea that
way.

00:15:31.428 --> 00:15:34.446
This is history and in the
allegory of theologians,

00:15:34.446 --> 00:15:36.799
the literal level must be
historical.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:38.179
It must be an event.
 

00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:40.548
So this is the distinction.
 

00:15:40.548 --> 00:15:43.698
Of course, the question is what
kind of allegories are used

00:15:43.698 --> 00:15:44.080
here?
 

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.418
We'll come to that in a moment,
but keep that in mind.

00:15:47.418 --> 00:15:52.240
This is--I hope--it's more than
of archaeological interest.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.897
Within the allegory of
theologians, they distinguish

00:15:55.897 --> 00:15:59.697
four levels of exegesis,
exegesis being a word meaning

00:15:59.697 --> 00:16:01.058
interpretation.
 

00:16:01.058 --> 00:16:02.474
Four levels:
the literal,

00:16:02.474 --> 00:16:03.298
the moral...
 

00:16:03.298 --> 00:16:06.259
An allegory is telling you what
to do, teaching you.

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:08.899
It has an ethics involved:
that you read and there is an

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:10.340
ethics when you are reading.
 

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.808
You have more or less a text.
 

00:16:11.808 --> 00:16:15.024
It's time to direct your will
or tell you what you should be

00:16:15.024 --> 00:16:15.460
doing.
 

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.479
A tropological telling you
what--tropological meaning what

00:16:18.479 --> 00:16:21.605
does it mean in terms of your
whole life, not just an action

00:16:21.605 --> 00:16:22.928
in a particular case.
 

00:16:22.928 --> 00:16:25.990
And then the so-called
analogical or eschatological.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:30.538
So that the story of the Jews
crossing the wilderness and

00:16:30.538 --> 00:16:35.090
going to the Jerusalem means
having a kind of a spiritual

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.671
conversion,
moral conversion,

00:16:37.671 --> 00:16:41.970
means that this is really the
way that life ought to go.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.720
You go from sin to glory or the
peace of the city,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.928
and then anagogically,
this is the story of the soul.

00:16:49.928 --> 00:16:53.600
It prefigures what the soul
ought to be.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.437
In the case of the allegory of
poets you only have two levels,

00:16:56.437 --> 00:16:57.740
the literal and the moral.
 

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.015
There are a lot of difficulties
with this way of distinguishing

00:17:02.015 --> 00:17:05.395
between the two types of
allegory because both the

00:17:05.395 --> 00:17:09.190
allegory of theologians and the
allegory of poets,

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.568
even if the allegory of
theologians refers to events,

00:17:13.568 --> 00:17:16.250
it's still words that we are
reading.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.825
There is a way in which Dante
seems to at one point dodge the

00:17:20.825 --> 00:17:25.096
whole thing of how can you
really distinguish between the

00:17:25.096 --> 00:17:27.290
two modes--
the rhetorical

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.368
modes--independently one from
the other.

00:17:30.368 --> 00:17:34.569
And actually he goes on saying,
really, the difference is in

00:17:34.569 --> 00:17:36.920
how you take the literal sense.
 

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.597
In the kind of act of faith
that you may have,

00:17:39.597 --> 00:17:42.990
that the literal sense--that
the Bible is the word of God,

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.490
then you are reading it
theologically.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:47.458
But if you decide,
and one might,

00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:51.148
to say that the Bible is really
a collection of extraordinary

00:17:51.148 --> 00:17:54.372
poetic stories,
then you are reading according

00:17:54.372 --> 00:17:56.098
to the allegory of poets.
 

00:17:56.098 --> 00:17:59.950
How is Dante circumventing this
whole issue?

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.450
He's circumventing the whole
issue by saying,

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.558
my story may well be taken as a
story of allegory of poets,

00:18:06.558 --> 00:18:10.729
but it's also an allegory of
theologians because the literal

00:18:10.729 --> 00:18:11.789
sense is 'I.'
 

00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:15.460
The historical sense is in me.
 

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.935
I am the historical cipher
moving through these

00:18:18.935 --> 00:18:20.940
experiences,
and therefore,

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.358
it is my life that they will
give a particular sense,

00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:29.308
a particular truth value,
to whatever poetic fable I may

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:30.568
be relating.
 

00:18:30.568 --> 00:18:33.549
We only have taken care of one
little problem here,

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:36.589
very external to the story,
the allegory of poets or

00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:38.259
allegory of theologians.
 

00:18:38.259 --> 00:18:42.809
It's time to decide that this
is what is going on here,

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:47.950
but, how are we to understand
this threat of petrification.

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:50.105
And you cannot really
understand it,

00:18:50.105 --> 00:18:51.769
but I'm here to tell you.
 

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:55.426
You cannot really understand it
on your own, so you have to

00:18:55.426 --> 00:18:56.500
trust my words.
 

00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:02.019
The fact is that Dante had
written in his youth a number of

00:19:02.019 --> 00:19:05.348
poems for a so-called Lady
Stone.

00:19:05.348 --> 00:19:07.460
In Italian, it's not as bad as
that,

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:11.368
though 'stone' could be a good
word in English,

00:19:11.368 --> 00:19:14.529
Donna
Petra--petra meaning

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.990
stone,
and the passion--it's a

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.298
description of a love that was
unrequited,

00:19:20.298 --> 00:19:24.115
but a passion for this woman
was such that he felt that his

00:19:24.115 --> 00:19:28.190
intellect would be petrified,
that he could be--in other

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.920
words he was unable to go
anywhere.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.500
It's a statement of despair,
if you wish,

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:38.137
whenever you have this sense of
a death that is going to take

00:19:38.137 --> 00:19:42.390
over and you are going to be
paralyzed in your will,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.910
then this is a petrification.
 

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.058
This is what I think is
happening here.

00:19:47.058 --> 00:19:49.426
Dante is engaged in
retrospection,

00:19:49.426 --> 00:19:53.730
to an experience of his past,
and that experience of his past

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:57.390
is now ahead of him threatening
him once again.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:20:00.348
He has to cleanse himself,
he has to move beyond it,

00:20:00.348 --> 00:20:04.150
but to explain better this idea
of the closing of the eyes--

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:07.067
this is why Medusa,
though he talks of Medusa there

00:20:07.067 --> 00:20:09.519
and this lady Petra is a kind of
Medusa.

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:15.021
Let me give you--read a little
scene from--that I think really

00:20:15.021 --> 00:20:20.163
explains what's going on and
prepare us to move forward to

00:20:20.163 --> 00:20:22.690
the next canto,
Canto X.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.288
It's a little scene from the
Confessions of Augustine.

00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:30.342
As you know,
a book that Dante knew very

00:20:30.342 --> 00:20:30.890
well.
 

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:37.718
Dante even goes on quoting it
at very strategic places,

00:20:37.718 --> 00:20:44.421
so there's not issue of
bringing it in gratuitously to

00:20:44.421 --> 00:20:47.328
explain this scene.
 

00:20:47.328 --> 00:20:52.936
It's actually direct--it could
be viewed--forgive the reversal,

00:20:52.936 --> 00:20:58.273
but this would be viewed as a
gloss on what Dante will go on

00:20:58.273 --> 00:20:59.358
writing.
 

00:20:59.358 --> 00:21:01.318
The Confessions is
written with--

00:21:01.318 --> 00:21:04.694
it's an intellectual
autobiography:

00:21:04.694 --> 00:21:10.453
the story of a young man who
will go on being fascinated by

00:21:10.453 --> 00:21:13.828
various schools of philosophy.
 

00:21:13.828 --> 00:21:18.358
He's a Manichean,
and then he will turn into a

00:21:18.358 --> 00:21:22.890
neo-Platonist,
goes on--is very flattered by a

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.910
skeptical, rhetorical way.
 

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.981
He's a professor of rhetoric--a
rhetorical way of dealing with

00:21:30.981 --> 00:21:33.808
values and the world around him.
 

00:21:33.808 --> 00:21:36.815
And then in Book IX,
he'll go on telling the story

00:21:36.815 --> 00:21:40.065
in the garden of Milan,
the famous story under the fig

00:21:40.065 --> 00:21:41.660
tree, very emblematic.
 

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.902
We could talk about these
things, about why the fig tree

00:21:44.902 --> 00:21:48.085
in Milan, which leads many
scholars to go on wondering,

00:21:48.085 --> 00:21:50.089
were there fig trees in Milan?
 

00:21:50.089 --> 00:21:52.210
Isn't the climate too cold?
 

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:56.077
You need really the southern
climes for that kind of thing,

00:21:56.077 --> 00:21:59.680
forgetting that the fig tree is
always in the Bible.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.959
It appears as the tree under
which the prophets go and rest

00:22:03.959 --> 00:22:07.942
in the mistaken belief that
everything is over and that

00:22:07.942 --> 00:22:11.190
somehow a time for complacency
may come.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.608
They're denouncing it of course.
 

00:22:12.608 --> 00:22:14.890
This is all done in a mode
denunciation,

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.240
and that's exactly where
Augustine puts himself,

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:22.796
under the fig tree and there he
goes on experiencing a

00:22:22.796 --> 00:22:25.461
particular drama by reading St.
 

00:22:25.461 --> 00:22:26.578
Paul, etc.
 

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:30.303
Throughout this text,
though this is about

00:22:30.303 --> 00:22:33.210
neo-Platonists and Manicheans.
 

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.078
As you know Augustine--as you
probably know,

00:22:37.078 --> 00:22:39.578
Augustine goes on reflecting
about his love of shows,

00:22:39.578 --> 00:22:42.720
the biggest one of them,
at the beginning of Book III,

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.068
is his love of theatre and his
critique of the theatre.

00:22:46.068 --> 00:22:50.164
Now, why do I go to the theatre
and how do I explain the fact

00:22:50.164 --> 00:22:53.784
that there may be some
well-meaning young man who sees

00:22:53.784 --> 00:22:57.880
the maid in distress and jumps
on the scene to free her.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.496
And he goes on talking about
how can I be a spectator,

00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:04.088
what does it mean to be a
spectator?

00:23:04.088 --> 00:23:06.568
What does it mean to be
involved?

00:23:06.568 --> 00:23:07.880
And then there is another
little scene.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.556
A friend of his,
Alypius--Alypius is a Greek

00:23:12.556 --> 00:23:17.450
intellectual in the best sense
of the word.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.258
A man who believes in
self-mastery,

00:23:21.258 --> 00:23:27.306
in intellectual self-mastery,
a young man who witnesses

00:23:27.306 --> 00:23:30.890
Augustine's own experiences.
 

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.318
In narratives you always have
Sancho accompany Don Quixote;

00:23:35.318 --> 00:23:38.808
there's always the other,
more or less skeptical,

00:23:38.808 --> 00:23:42.704
who gives authenticity and who
exactly will go on making claims

00:23:42.704 --> 00:23:46.663
for the truth value of what the
narrator or the protagonist will

00:23:46.663 --> 00:23:48.109
go on experiencing.
 

00:23:48.109 --> 00:23:49.578
His name is Alypius.
 

00:23:49.578 --> 00:23:53.180
Alypius will eventually rejoin
him.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:53.970
He's in Carthage.
 

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.250
They grew up together.
 

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.509
Augustine and he grew up
together.

00:23:56.509 --> 00:23:58.480
Augustine goes to Rome.
 

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.154
Alypius will rejoin him in
Rome, and they go on from there,

00:24:02.154 --> 00:24:03.930
eventually going to Milan.
 

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.250
When in Rome,
Alypius does what nobody--

00:24:06.250 --> 00:24:09.300
we would all do,
first thing he wants to do is

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:13.098
to go and watch the games played
at the amphitheatre,

00:24:13.098 --> 00:24:16.573
at the Colosseum and the games
are horrifying games to

00:24:16.573 --> 00:24:17.358
Augustine.
 

00:24:17.358 --> 00:24:19.548
He says, how can an
intellectual such as you,

00:24:19.548 --> 00:24:23.750
want to go to the games where
actually human beings are being

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:27.313
thrown,
for the delight of the crowds,

00:24:27.313 --> 00:24:30.940
are being thrown to beasts,
to lions.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:35.808
Alypius, of course,
he tries to justify himself.

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:38.058
I really want to go,
but exactly because,

00:24:38.058 --> 00:24:40.769
he'll say, but I really do,
because I'll read you the whole

00:24:40.769 --> 00:24:43.338
passage: 'I will go but because
I'm an intellectual,

00:24:43.338 --> 00:24:47.885
I promise that at the crucial
moment when the sign is given

00:24:47.885 --> 00:24:52.432
for the animal to devour the
human being lying there I will

00:24:52.432 --> 00:24:53.529
not watch.
 

00:24:53.529 --> 00:24:57.625
I will--I'm going to turn my
eyes away and I will shut my

00:24:57.625 --> 00:24:58.210
eyes.'
 

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.750
Let's see what happens.
 

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.559
This is from Book VI,
Chapter VIII.

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:04.778
It's a great little story.
 

00:25:04.778 --> 00:25:08.432
By the way, a scholar of
romance philology who used to

00:25:08.432 --> 00:25:12.430
teach here many years ago by the
name of Eric Auerbach,

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:16.190
a great Dante scholar and he
wrote this book called,

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.190
Mimesis,
he reflects on this scene,

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:20.868
not connecting it with Dante,
but it doesn't matter.

00:25:20.868 --> 00:25:25.175
I read it first in his book and
says, this is really--it's a

00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:29.410
little scene that marks the end
of Hellenic rationalism.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.607
Let's read this;
it's interesting just because

00:25:31.607 --> 00:25:34.442
of that, and then we'll see how
we could apply it to Dante.

00:25:34.442 --> 00:25:35.808
I think it's very clear.
 

00:25:35.808 --> 00:25:40.265
"He had gone to Rome to
study law,"

00:25:40.265 --> 00:25:44.455
this is Alypius,
"and there he was carried

00:25:44.455 --> 00:25:48.461
away incredibly with an
incredible eagerness after the

00:25:48.461 --> 00:25:50.200
shows of gladiators.
 

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.759
For being utterly adverse to
and detesting such spectacles,

00:25:55.759 --> 00:25:59.218
he was one day by chance met by
diverse of his acquaintances and

00:25:59.218 --> 00:26:02.401
fellow students coming from
dinner and they with a familiar

00:26:02.401 --> 00:26:05.046
violence,
hailed him vehemently refusing

00:26:05.046 --> 00:26:08.298
and resisting into the
amphitheatre during this cruel

00:26:08.298 --> 00:26:09.548
and deadly shows.
 

00:26:09.548 --> 00:26:13.134
He thus protesting,
'Though you hail my body to

00:26:13.134 --> 00:26:17.315
that place,' this is Alypius,
"And there set me,

00:26:17.315 --> 00:26:21.420
can you force me also to turn
my mind or my eyes to those

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.078
shows?
 

00:26:22.078 --> 00:26:26.987
I shall then be absent while
present and so shall overcome

00:26:26.987 --> 00:26:28.710
both you and them.
 

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.699
They, hearing this,
led him on, nevertheless,

00:26:31.699 --> 00:26:35.912
desirous per chance to try that
very thing, whether he could do

00:26:35.912 --> 00:26:37.338
as he said."
 

00:26:37.338 --> 00:26:41.512
"When they will come
thither and had taken their

00:26:41.512 --> 00:26:46.087
places as they could,
the whole place kindled with

00:26:46.087 --> 00:26:49.175
that savage pastime,
but he,"

00:26:49.175 --> 00:26:52.970
Alypius, "closing the
passage of his eyes,

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.259
forbade his mind to range
abroad of such evil,

00:26:56.259 --> 00:26:59.390
and would he had stopped his
ears also.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:03.791
For in the fight when one fell,
a mighty cry of the whole

00:27:03.791 --> 00:27:07.814
people striking him,
strongly overcome by curiosity

00:27:07.814 --> 00:27:11.578
and as prepared to despise and
be superior to it,

00:27:11.578 --> 00:27:14.061
whatever it were,
even when seen,

00:27:14.061 --> 00:27:18.482
he opened his eyes and was
stricken with a deeper wound in

00:27:18.482 --> 00:27:21.506
his soul,
than the other whom he desired

00:27:21.506 --> 00:27:23.250
to behold was in his body.
 

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.527
And he fell more miserably than
he upon whose fall that mighty

00:27:27.527 --> 00:27:30.971
noise was raised,
which entered through his ears

00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:35.124
and unlocked his eyes to make
way for the striking and beating

00:27:35.124 --> 00:27:36.348
down of a soul.
 

00:27:36.348 --> 00:27:40.105
Bold rather than resolute,
and the weaker in that it had

00:27:40.105 --> 00:27:44.134
presumed on itself which ought
to have relied on Thee for so

00:27:44.134 --> 00:27:46.368
soon the--
" the whole confession is

00:27:46.368 --> 00:27:48.561
addressed to God,
for it's a confession,

00:27:48.561 --> 00:27:52.079
a witnessing to God so in case
you are confused about the

00:27:52.079 --> 00:27:52.960
references.
 

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.630
"For so soon as he saw
that blood,

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:01.568
he therewith drank down
savageness,

00:28:01.568 --> 00:28:06.315
not turned away,
but fixed his eye drinking in

00:28:06.315 --> 00:28:09.964
frenzy,
unawares and was delighted with

00:28:09.964 --> 00:28:14.568
that guilty fight and
intoxicated with bloody pastime.

00:28:14.568 --> 00:28:19.243
Nor was he now the man he came,
but one of the throng he came

00:28:19.243 --> 00:28:19.788
unto.
 

00:28:19.788 --> 00:28:23.880
Yea, a true associate of theirs
that brought him thither.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.690
Why say more?
 

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:31.547
He beheld, shouted,
kindled, carried thence with

00:28:31.547 --> 00:28:34.230
him,
the madness which should goad

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.098
him to return not only with them
who first drew him thither,

00:28:38.098 --> 00:28:40.910
but also before them,
yea and to join others.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:45.065
Yet, thence it did start with a
most strong, a most merciful

00:28:45.065 --> 00:28:48.939
hand, pluck him and taught him
to have confidence not in

00:28:48.939 --> 00:28:50.630
himself but in Thee.
 

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.200
But this was after,"
and that's really the story.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.298
What is the meaning of this
story?

00:28:55.298 --> 00:29:00.368
In the Confessions,
I think that Augustine is very

00:29:00.368 --> 00:29:05.440
clear: the failure of the mind
to master its own will.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.598
It's about the crisis.
 

00:29:06.598 --> 00:29:09.259
It's about the weakness of the
will to begin with,

00:29:09.259 --> 00:29:14.394
but it's also the pride:
the belief that one can rise

00:29:14.394 --> 00:29:19.923
above the contingency of
temptations and be in control of

00:29:19.923 --> 00:29:21.108
oneself.
 

00:29:21.108 --> 00:29:25.732
And yet, it's a story of a
temptation which he,

00:29:25.732 --> 00:29:28.848
Alypius, cannot quite resist.
 

00:29:28.848 --> 00:29:32.328
I think that this is exactly
what's happening in Canto IX.

00:29:32.328 --> 00:29:36.558
Dante's dramatizing not only
the failure of the intellect;

00:29:36.558 --> 00:29:40.093
he's already been talking about
the early part of the canto,

00:29:40.093 --> 00:29:42.308
the failure of Virgil to guide
him.

00:29:42.308 --> 00:29:46.544
He's discussing now the failure
of his will, at least seen

00:29:46.544 --> 00:29:50.928
in--as an event of the past but
clearly is seen as something

00:29:50.928 --> 00:29:53.380
that can happen to him again.
 

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:59.723
The passage to the city can
take place after this scene and

00:29:59.723 --> 00:30:06.506
now he enters into the City of
Dis and against the walls of the

00:30:06.506 --> 00:30:10.857
city,
he finds the Epicureans--again,

00:30:10.857 --> 00:30:16.640
those who do not believe in the
mortality of the soul.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.750
Let me just read in Canto X
some passages.

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.790
By the way, each Canto X of
the Divine Comedy,

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.125
they're really are all cantos
intimately related with each

00:30:26.125 --> 00:30:26.710
other.
 

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.155
So if you were looking for a
paper you want to connect Canto

00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:31.592
X of Inferno,
Canto X of Purgatorio,

00:30:31.592 --> 00:30:35.400
and Canto X of Paradise,
I would encourage you to do so.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.868
Let me just read a few lines.
 

00:30:37.868 --> 00:30:44.638
Dante asks who these souls are
and the answer he gets is this

00:30:44.638 --> 00:30:48.519
line 12,
"All will be shut in when

00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:51.510
they return from
Jehoshaphat,"

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:54.680
which is the valley in
Jerusalem;

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:59.857
in the valley,
into the valley of Jerusalem

00:30:59.857 --> 00:31:06.762
where, according to the law,
the resurrection of the dead

00:31:06.762 --> 00:31:09.230
will take place.
 

00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.269
That's where they would be
meeting.

00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:14.151
It's interesting then,
that there is this contrast in

00:31:14.151 --> 00:31:16.700
the canto between the so-called
Epicureans,

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.338
who do not believe in their
immortality of the soul,

00:31:20.338 --> 00:31:23.977
and clearly,
this view, this opposition as

00:31:23.977 --> 00:31:26.909
one could call it,
between Athens,

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:29.690
very classical,
Athens, and Jerusalem.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:33.759
You may have heard of this,
the city of Athens by the way,

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:37.261
the word itself means
immortality, the immortality of

00:31:37.261 --> 00:31:40.288
athanatos,
the immortality of wisdom.

00:31:40.288 --> 00:31:45.868
Wisdom survives,
but not the people.

00:31:45.868 --> 00:31:50.590
There is a kind of--the kind of
contrast between the two cities,

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.140
very old, very ancient
contrast.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.165
And now we have in this part,
Epicurus and all his followers,

00:31:57.165 --> 00:31:59.180
what we call the Epicureans.
 

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:03.913
Let me just gloss the
Epicureans a little bit further

00:32:03.913 --> 00:32:06.278
from--than I did before.
 

00:32:06.278 --> 00:32:10.183
There are two types--in the
mythography of the Epicureans,

00:32:10.183 --> 00:32:12.650
there are two types of
Epicureans.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:14.558
Whenever we think about the
Epicureans,

00:32:14.558 --> 00:32:17.420
we think about those,
the vulgar Epicureans,

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:21.140
those who think about--worship
their stomach,

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.150
the pleasures of food,
an Epicurean in that sense.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.647
I think that Dante has
dramatized that kind of

00:32:28.647 --> 00:32:31.680
Epicurean in Canto VI when he
meets,

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.836
remember Ciacco,
whose name means

00:32:33.836 --> 00:32:35.048
"pig."
 

00:32:35.048 --> 00:32:38.478
In fact we talked about the
hogs of Epicurus,

00:32:38.478 --> 00:32:40.269
the herd of Epicurus.
 

00:32:40.269 --> 00:32:42.788
But then there is the noble
version of the Epicureans,

00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:45.085
the canto here,
in Canto X those who are

00:32:45.085 --> 00:32:47.440
interested in intellectual
pleasures,

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.069
the pleasures of conversations,
the pleasures of friendship,

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:53.588
the pleasures of meditation.
 

00:32:53.588 --> 00:32:57.798
And they are those who do
not--who remove themselves to

00:32:57.798 --> 00:33:01.194
the garden,
do not seem to really care much

00:33:01.194 --> 00:33:05.432
about what happens around them,
because in the belief that they

00:33:05.432 --> 00:33:08.781
should really take--
cultivate their soul and

00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:12.910
cultivate their own pursuits,
take care of their own pursuits.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:14.608
That's what we are having here.
 

00:33:14.608 --> 00:33:18.144
These are the noble,
philosophical Epicureans,

00:33:18.144 --> 00:33:22.150
not the vulgar sort that
believe in the supremacy of

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:23.798
bodily pleasures.
 

00:33:23.798 --> 00:33:26.914
Nonetheless,
pleasure is the aim of an

00:33:26.914 --> 00:33:29.608
Epicurean ethics,
my pleasure.

00:33:29.608 --> 00:33:33.564
This continues,
"in this part Epicurus and

00:33:33.564 --> 00:33:37.351
all his followers,
who make the soul die with the

00:33:37.351 --> 00:33:39.730
body have their burial
place."

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:44.184
How fitting,
how fitting is the punishment

00:33:44.184 --> 00:33:47.118
for this crime,
this sin.

00:33:47.118 --> 00:33:50.874
It's perfect because these
people never really believed in

00:33:50.874 --> 00:33:55.088
the immortality of the soul and
they are condemned to be dead.

00:33:55.088 --> 00:34:00.337
That's what they think and they
dwell literally in sarcophagus,

00:34:00.337 --> 00:34:02.539
in sarcophagi,
entombed.

00:34:02.539 --> 00:34:04.910
That's how they appear.
 

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.940
There is another little detail
I have given you--

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.480
sometimes we may wonder about
the appropriateness of a sin,

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.260
of a punishment for a
particular sin,

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.117
but here we have no reason to
really be surprised at all by

00:34:19.117 --> 00:34:23.389
this kind of destiny reserved
for the Epicureans.

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:25.070
"But for thy question to
me,

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:27.380
thou shalt soon have
satisfaction from within there,

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.849
and for the desire too about
which thou art silent."

00:34:29.849 --> 00:34:32.159
Then they're interrupted.
 

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.987
All of a sudden,
now Dante's once again

00:34:34.987 --> 00:34:38.228
involved,
and what's here primarily is no

00:34:38.228 --> 00:34:41.639
longer the question of
immorality of souls,

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:47.911
but how the political aspect,
the political implications of

00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:53.777
this kind of belief,
of believing in immorality of

00:34:53.777 --> 00:34:57.552
the soul,
how is this refracted onto the

00:34:57.552 --> 00:34:59.880
political scene as it were?
 

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.097
Again, therefore,
this is almost a Platonic

00:35:03.097 --> 00:35:05.815
conceit,
the relationship now between no

00:35:05.815 --> 00:35:09.523
longer bodies and cities,
as we saw in Inferno VI,

00:35:09.523 --> 00:35:11.130
but here soul and city.
 

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:13.210
Is this a soulless city?
 

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.570
What happens?
 

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.269
How do we experience it?
 

00:35:16.269 --> 00:35:17.409
How livable?
 

00:35:17.409 --> 00:35:22.065
Which is--I mean it is also a
pun, how livable is this kind of

00:35:22.065 --> 00:35:22.599
city?
 

00:35:22.599 --> 00:35:25.233
What happens and what is
the--what are the

00:35:25.233 --> 00:35:28.639
relationship--what is the
relationship between various

00:35:28.639 --> 00:35:29.409
figures?
 

00:35:29.409 --> 00:35:33.702
Dante singles out two people,
one a Guelf and one a

00:35:33.702 --> 00:35:34.820
Ghibelline.
 

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.833
We are in the middle of the
civil war of Florence once

00:35:38.833 --> 00:35:39.440
again.
 

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.260
It's going to be Farinata,
a Ghibelline and Cavalcanti,

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.789
the father, the old man,
who is a Guelf.

00:35:49.789 --> 00:35:52.534
By the way, they're also
related to each other because

00:35:52.534 --> 00:35:55.298
Cavalcanti's son,
Dante's best friend--you

00:35:55.298 --> 00:35:59.119
remember he dedicates his
Vita nuova to him,

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:02.809
he calls him 'my first friend
Guido Cavalcanti'--

00:36:02.809 --> 00:36:05.400
had married the daughter of
Farinata.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.293
They stand there in their tombs
ignoring each other and each

00:36:09.293 --> 00:36:12.396
ignoring the pangs,
worries, and perplexities of

00:36:12.396 --> 00:36:13.320
the other.
 

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.130
It's a little picture of what
we call "any city."

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.760
This is the city in the beyond
where everybody's squabbling.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.777
Nobody's paying attention to
anybody else,

00:36:24.777 --> 00:36:28.090
and everybody believes that
one's own passion,

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:32.139
one's own concern is really
paramount and foremost.

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:34.429
There's nothing that can come
near to it,

00:36:34.429 --> 00:36:39.675
so it's all--it's a canto that
interestingly enough is marked

00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:42.909
by interruptions:
one is speaking,

00:36:42.909 --> 00:36:45.429
the other says forget it,
I got to talk now it's my turn.

00:36:45.429 --> 00:36:50.534
And so it is the--it is a
little vignette of Florence in

00:36:50.534 --> 00:36:55.175
the year 1300 probably,
or later but 1300 is a good

00:36:55.175 --> 00:36:56.659
date for us.
 

00:36:56.659 --> 00:36:58.617
So, he's interrupted,
Virgil and Dante are

00:36:58.617 --> 00:37:01.855
interrupted by someone who says,
"'O Tuscan who makest thy

00:37:01.855 --> 00:37:05.090
way alive through the city of
fire and speakest so modestly,

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:10.443
may it please thee to stop at
this point: thy tongue shows

00:37:10.443 --> 00:37:15.139
thee native of that noble
fatherland to which I was

00:37:15.139 --> 00:37:17.300
perhaps too harsh.'
 

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.548
Suddenly this sound issued from
one of the chests,"

00:37:19.548 --> 00:37:20.039
and so on.
 

00:37:20.039 --> 00:37:22.693
So they go on,
"Turn round,

00:37:22.693 --> 00:37:27.744
what ails thee?"--says
Virgil--"See there Farinata

00:37:27.744 --> 00:37:31.590
who has risen erect;
from the middle up thou shalt

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.260
see his full height."
 

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:36.659
He appears from the navel up in
the tomb.

00:37:36.659 --> 00:37:38.579
Now, a little historical detail.
 

00:37:38.579 --> 00:37:44.340
There used to be in Rome,
a church is still there,

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.550
but it was already there in the
year 1300,

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:52.467
when Dante went on an embassy
to Rome: the church so-called of

00:37:52.467 --> 00:37:55.449
the Holy Cross in Jerusalem
which,

00:37:55.449 --> 00:37:57.860
according to the legend,
was built with material,

00:37:57.860 --> 00:38:02.121
with stones from Jerusalem that
had been brought to Rome by

00:38:02.121 --> 00:38:04.400
Constantine's mother,
Helena.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:09.224
In the basement of that church,
which would be opened only once

00:38:09.224 --> 00:38:13.797
a year around the Easter season,
there would be a mosaic

00:38:13.797 --> 00:38:17.090
showing--and you can say it
would only--

00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:22.579
on Good Friday that the--that
basement would be open.

00:38:22.579 --> 00:38:25.610
And that mosaic,
it's no longer there so I

00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:28.420
cannot--I'm not encouraging
tourism;

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.639
it's just I'm giving you a
little detail.

00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:36.219
There used to be a mosaic of
the rising Christ from--

00:38:36.219 --> 00:38:40.918
shown from the navel up and
it's clear here that the

00:38:40.918 --> 00:38:46.077
representation of Farinata
showing himself from the navel

00:38:46.077 --> 00:38:52.159
up is meant as a caricature of
the belief in the Resurrection.

00:38:52.159 --> 00:38:54.141
There are two--this is the
really--of the story of a man

00:38:54.141 --> 00:38:55.690
who doesn't believe in the
Resurrection,

00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.199
and iconographically Dante will
go on focusing,

00:39:00.199 --> 00:39:02.260
insisting on this--on the
counter.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.460
This man doesn't believe in the
Resurrection.

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.342
That is another possibility of
looking at it so there is a--the

00:39:09.342 --> 00:39:13.440
description is clearly meant to
evoke all of that.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.996
There is a great exchange
between them:

00:39:15.996 --> 00:39:20.003
who defeated whom,
the continuous battles between

00:39:20.003 --> 00:39:25.018
Guelfs and Ghibellines and Dante
claims that his own family

00:39:25.018 --> 00:39:29.429
managed to take good revenge
when the time came.

00:39:29.429 --> 00:39:32.784
And clearly the implication is
that more revenge,

00:39:32.784 --> 00:39:35.719
since Dante has been,
will be necessary.

00:39:35.719 --> 00:39:43.846
They're interrupted by the
sight of--by the old man

00:39:43.846 --> 00:39:45.960
Cavalcanti.
 

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:51.916
Look at what the story of the
canto is: Farinata worries about

00:39:51.916 --> 00:39:57.467
his ancestors;
Cavalcanti worries about his

00:39:57.467 --> 00:39:58.179
son.
 

00:39:58.179 --> 00:40:02.010
So these are the Epicureans who
have a sense of continuity

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.943
somehow,
a sense of dynastic continuity:

00:40:04.943 --> 00:40:09.050
all within the immanence of
personal concerns and family.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:14.532
So they go--they move beyond
the fragmentations of self from

00:40:14.532 --> 00:40:15.739
the others.
 

00:40:15.739 --> 00:40:18.628
They seem to have a kind of
extended idea of themselves,

00:40:18.628 --> 00:40:21.360
in spite of themselves,
in spite of their beliefs.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:24.500
This is what happens,
an extraordinary scene:

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.570
"Then rose to sight,"
line 55 and following,

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.530
"beside him a shade
showing as far as the chin;

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.179
I think he had lifted himself
on his knees.

00:40:35.179 --> 00:40:39.105
He looked round about me as if
he had a desire to see whether

00:40:39.105 --> 00:40:43.052
someone was with me,
but when his expectation was

00:40:43.052 --> 00:40:48.369
all quenched he said,
weeping: 'If thou goest through

00:40:48.369 --> 00:40:52.639
this blind prison by height of
genius,

00:40:52.639 --> 00:40:54.630
where is my son?
 

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:57.889
Why is he not with thee?"
 

00:40:57.889 --> 00:41:00.947
The reference clearly is to
Dante's best friend,

00:41:00.947 --> 00:41:05.110
to Guido, whose name also means
that he should be guiding him.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:08.750
Maybe the old man--the old
father was hoping that the son,

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:12.572
according to his name,
could really be leading the

00:41:12.572 --> 00:41:16.615
younger poet,
as he had led him in his early

00:41:16.615 --> 00:41:19.599
poetic experiments in Florence.
 

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:21.750
And then he answers,
he's disappointed,

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:24.179
and Dante answers,
I answered him,

00:41:24.179 --> 00:41:28.440
"I come not of myself,
he," doesn't even mention

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:30.188
him,
meaning Virgil,

00:41:30.188 --> 00:41:34.295
"he that waits yonder is
leading me,"

00:41:34.295 --> 00:41:38.849
so this is the pun on
"guido"--

00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:42.739
"through here perhaps
to..."

00:41:42.739 --> 00:41:44.329
That's very unclear.
 

00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:46.242
The text here,
my translation is "to

00:41:46.242 --> 00:41:48.871
her" and so does yours,
but many other translations

00:41:48.871 --> 00:41:50.639
probably say something
different.

00:41:50.639 --> 00:41:55.938
I would say "to one,
your Guido held in

00:41:55.938 --> 00:41:57.909
disdain."
 

00:41:57.909 --> 00:42:00.458
It's unclear because the
"her"

00:42:00.458 --> 00:42:04.052
would mean he's leading me,
Virgil leads me to Beatrice,

00:42:04.052 --> 00:42:06.079
whom Guido held in disdain.
 

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:09.059
Why would Guido hold Beatrice
in disdain?

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:11.340
Is this really the story of the
Vita nuova?

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.199
The antagonism between Guido
and Beatrice?

00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:18.429
There's nothing that really
suggests all of that.

00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:22.777
"To one"
would be to God or to some aim

00:42:22.777 --> 00:42:27.849
that Guido held in disdain,
we'll see what that means.

00:42:27.849 --> 00:42:29.978
"His words,
and the nature of his

00:42:29.978 --> 00:42:33.543
punishment had already told me
his name, so that I replied thus

00:42:33.543 --> 00:42:34.119
fully.
 

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:38.681
Suddenly erect,
he cried, 'How saidst thou 'he

00:42:38.681 --> 00:42:40.099
held'?"
 

00:42:40.099 --> 00:42:46.949
That's--Dante uses the past
preterite, "he held."

00:42:46.949 --> 00:42:50.266
The old man,
infers because of the use of

00:42:50.266 --> 00:42:54.248
the past preterite,
that his son is already dead:

00:42:54.248 --> 00:42:56.820
a mistake, an equivocation.
 

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.570
"He held?
 

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:00.090
Lives he not still?
 

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.159
Strikes not the sweet light on
his eyes?'

00:43:03.159 --> 00:43:07.483
When he perceived that I made
some delay before replying he

00:43:07.483 --> 00:43:10.840
fell back again and was seen no
more."

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.820
Farinata is unconcerned.
 

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.599
He goes on saying,
well yeah you drove us back but

00:43:16.599 --> 00:43:19.898
we drove you back,
brings the subject to the

00:43:19.898 --> 00:43:22.385
political--
strictly to the war between

00:43:22.385 --> 00:43:25.389
Guelfs and Ghibellines so that
we really have to ask--

00:43:25.389 --> 00:43:27.309
Dante goes on saying,
please before leaving,

00:43:27.309 --> 00:43:30.300
reassure the old man that his
son is still alive,

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:35.260
because by the year of the
journey Dante--

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.809
Guido was supposed to be alive.
 

00:43:36.809 --> 00:43:39.268
Though he will die very quickly
afterwards.

00:43:39.268 --> 00:43:42.949
What is this story of political
disarray of Florence?

00:43:42.949 --> 00:43:49.021
And the story of the memory of
Dante's friend with whom he had

00:43:49.021 --> 00:43:53.599
just--the friendship was
just--had finished.

00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:54.690
The friendship was over.
 

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:58.358
Dante, for those of you who are
interested in the biography of

00:43:58.358 --> 00:44:01.505
the poet--
one of the early and toughest

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:06.775
decisions he had to make was to
banish Guido Cavalcanti from the

00:44:06.775 --> 00:44:11.376
city because he thought that
Guido was the cause of some

00:44:11.376 --> 00:44:13.719
unrest within the city.
 

00:44:13.719 --> 00:44:17.079
Guido went into exile and never
made it back.

00:44:17.079 --> 00:44:23.353
He died three months later in
the swamps of near--of Liguria,

00:44:23.353 --> 00:44:26.699
a little bit north of Tuscany.
 

00:44:26.699 --> 00:44:30.101
Dante lives in many ways with a
kind of guilt,

00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:32.219
personal guilt,
I suppose.

00:44:32.219 --> 00:44:35.963
He won't talk about it openly
about the--what had been

00:44:35.963 --> 00:44:37.730
happening between them.
 

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.929
What is--how are we trying to
understand this scene?

00:44:40.929 --> 00:44:44.969
Let me just give you some
details about-- some other

00:44:44.969 --> 00:44:47.110
details about this canto.
 

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.411
"If you go through this
blind prison by height of

00:44:49.411 --> 00:44:50.150
genius..."
 

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:51.570
There's a little bit of irony
there.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.090
Cavalcanti clearly does not
understand,

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.996
nor can he understand,
that Dante's journey in the

00:44:56.996 --> 00:44:59.429
beyond is not due to height of
genius,

00:44:59.429 --> 00:45:02.465
but these are the philosophers
and he has a kind of

00:45:02.465 --> 00:45:06.108
philosophical idea about how
certain experiences are going to

00:45:06.108 --> 00:45:07.079
be possible.
 

00:45:07.079 --> 00:45:10.150
"Why is not my son with
you?" Etc.

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.699
"I come not of myself;
he that ...

00:45:12.699 --> 00:45:16.780
to one whom your Guido held in
disdain."

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:20.730
Well, what has happened here?
 

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.969
Who is Guido really?
 

00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:25.710
Guido is what we call an
Averroist.

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:28.050
Did you ever hear the term,
Averroist?

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:29.170
Probably not.
 

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:33.079
Averroes, Dante actually
mentions him in Limbo.

00:45:33.079 --> 00:45:36.356
He was an Arab philosopher and
a famous commentator of

00:45:36.356 --> 00:45:37.099
Aristotle.
 

00:45:37.099 --> 00:45:41.349
And of all the texts,
he commented just as now,

00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:44.887
in the Middle Ages they would
be reading the great classics of

00:45:44.887 --> 00:45:47.179
philosophy,
especially very difficult text

00:45:47.179 --> 00:45:49.467
such as the--
On the Soul of Aristotle

00:45:49.467 --> 00:45:52.420
with--
following the commentators.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.268
Averroes was known as the
"Great Commentator."

00:45:54.268 --> 00:45:59.530
He was the great commentator of
Aristotle's On the Soul.

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:04.085
And he argues that Aristotle
does not believe in the

00:46:04.085 --> 00:46:06.409
immortality of the soul.
 

00:46:06.409 --> 00:46:09.643
That's the argument that he's
going to be challenged by

00:46:09.643 --> 00:46:13.885
Aquinas and by many others,
but that's the primary--Guido

00:46:13.885 --> 00:46:18.860
Cavalcanti follows Averroes'
understanding about the soul.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.346
The one who is here,
a heretic so to speak,

00:46:22.346 --> 00:46:26.413
is not just the old man,
but also Guido Cavalcanti

00:46:26.413 --> 00:46:27.409
himself.
 

00:46:27.409 --> 00:46:31.806
At this point,
before I go any further telling

00:46:31.806 --> 00:46:35.909
you more about the who is an
Averroist,

00:46:35.909 --> 00:46:37.230
what does it mean to be an
Averroist,

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.110
I really have to raise a point
with you.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:41.070
What does heresy mean?
 

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:46.061
Because I did indicate that in
antiquity it was never really

00:46:46.061 --> 00:46:50.630
thought of as a sin because it's
a question of mind.

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:53.358
The word comes from the Greek
haeresis,

00:46:53.358 --> 00:46:55.300
meaning "to choose."
 

00:46:55.300 --> 00:47:00.273
One who is a heretic is someone
who makes a particular

00:47:00.273 --> 00:47:02.340
intellectual choice.
 

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:08.362
To be viewed as a sinner,
you have to also indicate some

00:47:08.362 --> 00:47:11.994
kind,
an element of pride behind a

00:47:11.994 --> 00:47:17.211
particular belief and so Guido
is held responsible for

00:47:17.211 --> 00:47:20.275
spreading,
disseminating this idea of

00:47:20.275 --> 00:47:20.989
Averroism.
 

00:47:20.989 --> 00:47:22.280
What is then Averroism?
 

00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.960
Well one of the ideas that
Averroes says is that we--

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.829
in the commentary On the
Soul--

00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:36.550
that we human beings are not
even capable,

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:39.659
intrinsically capable of
thinking.

00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:45.039
That we are made--remember the
famous structure?

00:47:45.039 --> 00:47:46.539
The diagram about the soul?
 

00:47:46.539 --> 00:47:51.880
That we are a concupiscent
entities and sensitive entities.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:56.309
We're also rational entities,
but rationality occurs to us

00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:57.630
intermittently.
 

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.960
Thoughts, we even say that in
English, 'a thought came to me.'

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.726
That reminds me the best way of
understanding Averroism:

00:48:05.726 --> 00:48:09.639
we don't think all the time,
occasionally thought comes to

00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:11.860
us, and there's no way that
really.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:15.898
And when we think we are really
existing in a sort of break,

00:48:15.898 --> 00:48:18.909
a discontinuity from the world
of feeling.

00:48:18.909 --> 00:48:22.161
So there's a fairly tragic
understanding,

00:48:22.161 --> 00:48:26.793
making human beings the object
of thought, not subjects of

00:48:26.793 --> 00:48:27.768
thought.
 

00:48:27.768 --> 00:48:30.840
We are not agents capable of
producing thoughts,

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:35.753
thoughts come to us and also
tragic because it sort of

00:48:35.753 --> 00:48:40.295
presents a break between the
sensitive part of our

00:48:40.295 --> 00:48:45.210
experiences and the rational
part of experiences.

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:48.769
We live like animals more often
than not: we eat,

00:48:48.769 --> 00:48:51.070
we drink, we sleep and so on.
 

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:54.349
Then occasionally we manage to
disengage ourselves from all of

00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:56.768
this and capable of
contemplative thoughts.

00:48:56.768 --> 00:49:00.021
At that point we no longer
really live we are just--we are

00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:03.389
abstracted from ourselves,
we are removed from ourselves.

00:49:03.389 --> 00:49:05.590
Not only Guido believed in
these ideas,

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:09.445
these ideas shape one of the
most beautiful poems written at

00:49:09.445 --> 00:49:12.650
the time of Dante by Guido
Cavalcanti himself,

00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:15.920
and the poem is called,
A Lady Asks Me.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.409
I want to tell you what the
poem is about.

00:49:17.409 --> 00:49:21.034
It's a poem where there's a
fiction: the poet Guido

00:49:21.034 --> 00:49:25.094
Cavalcanti imagines that a
woman, which may have been the

00:49:25.094 --> 00:49:27.559
case, asks him to define love.
 

00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:31.047
You poets are always talking
about love, and I don't

00:49:31.047 --> 00:49:34.876
understand what you mean by
love, and nor do I understand

00:49:34.876 --> 00:49:36.860
what the effects of love.
 

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.559
And he writes a song,
this long song,

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:42.195
saying that love--a lady asks
me to talk about the nature of

00:49:42.195 --> 00:49:43.985
love,
the function of love,

00:49:43.985 --> 00:49:45.530
and the effects of love.
 

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:47.391
And he goes on almost
scholastically,

00:49:47.391 --> 00:49:49.150
taking one case after the
other.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.603
He begins by saying,
in the exposition,

00:49:52.603 --> 00:49:56.512
that love is a passion that
comes from Mars,

00:49:56.512 --> 00:49:58.239
not from Venus.
 

00:49:58.239 --> 00:50:02.117
That is to say,
the nature of love is always to

00:50:02.117 --> 00:50:05.742
be one of conflict and one of
war and chaos,

00:50:05.742 --> 00:50:09.619
not one of an order,
the benevolent Venus.

00:50:09.619 --> 00:50:14.365
He goes on too saying that
it's--it induces death and it's

00:50:14.365 --> 00:50:17.780
characterized by deliriums of
the mind.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:22.070
It's a very clearly,
grim idea of love.

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:27.608
What Dante's doing in this
Canto X is connecting Guido's

00:50:27.608 --> 00:50:32.239
ideas of love and the politics
of civil war.

00:50:32.239 --> 00:50:36.431
He finds that there is a strict
necessary connection,

00:50:36.431 --> 00:50:41.509
a necessary correlation between
the thinking about love of Guido

00:50:41.509 --> 00:50:44.329
Cavalcanti, whom Dante opposes.
 

00:50:44.329 --> 00:50:46.309
As you know from the Vita
nuova,

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:49.353
he believes that Beatrice can
indeed be someone who can lead

00:50:49.353 --> 00:50:51.518
him to God and to the knowledge
of God,

00:50:51.518 --> 00:50:55.260
in the persuasion that it is
not by truth that you come to

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:56.768
the knowledge of God.
 

00:50:56.768 --> 00:50:59.012
If you cannot come to the
knowledge of God by truth,

00:50:59.012 --> 00:51:01.079
then how do you come to the
knowledge of God?

00:51:01.079 --> 00:51:06.072
By love, by thinking about
love: that's the way of the

00:51:06.072 --> 00:51:06.920
ascent.
 

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.981
On the other hand,
Dante will have this idea that

00:51:10.981 --> 00:51:14.777
the political--
that the order of civil--that

00:51:14.777 --> 00:51:17.585
this disorder,
the civil disorder,

00:51:17.585 --> 00:51:22.342
the civil war is nothing else
than the phenomenon of a theory

00:51:22.342 --> 00:51:26.730
put forth by the Averroist,
by Guido Cavalcanti.

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:31.164
This is really what I think the
double focus of this canto:

00:51:31.164 --> 00:51:35.139
love and politics and the
connection between them.

00:51:35.139 --> 00:51:39.523
A connection which,
by the way, the Averroists whom

00:51:39.523 --> 00:51:43.030
Dante links with the Epicureans,
deny.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.632
But he's making this
connection, imaginatively,

00:51:45.632 --> 00:51:48.630
a connection denied by the
philosophers themselves.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:53.079
With Canto XI and--Dante will
go on.

00:51:53.079 --> 00:51:55.650
We have a few minutes and I can
talk about this.

00:51:55.650 --> 00:52:00.900
Dante, as I said,
explains the order of--on the

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:05.579
face of it, the juxtaposition is
clear.

00:52:05.579 --> 00:52:10.342
To the disorder of the city,
we are now going to have a

00:52:10.342 --> 00:52:14.753
reflection, a rational
reflection on the order that

00:52:14.753 --> 00:52:17.400
sustains the City of Hell.
 

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:21.849
If there is any disordered
place, it is as if there's a

00:52:21.849 --> 00:52:24.900
logic even to the disorder of
evil.

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:31.306
And the idea is that there is a
tripartite division to Hell,

00:52:31.306 --> 00:52:33.369
the plan of Hell.
 

00:52:33.369 --> 00:52:37.634
All of the sins are divided
into three parts,

00:52:37.634 --> 00:52:42.188
sins of incontinence that we
saw from Canto III,

00:52:42.188 --> 00:52:45.289
IV, V, actually to Canto IX.
 

00:52:45.289 --> 00:52:49.914
The middle area which is called
the area of violence and then

00:52:49.914 --> 00:52:52.690
the third area,
the sins of fraud.

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:57.601
And Dante calls fraud the sin
peculiar to human beings because

00:52:57.601 --> 00:53:01.860
it's not just a sin of the will,
but there is also the

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:05.257
premeditation of the mind,
the complicity of the mind,

00:53:05.257 --> 00:53:08.268
the sense of fraud which is
also a sense of treachery.

00:53:08.268 --> 00:53:14.536
Dante sees the conjunction of
will and, at the same time,

00:53:14.536 --> 00:53:20.579
the order of reason in the
performance of that evil.

00:53:20.579 --> 00:53:27.550
The canto comes to--ends with a
question.

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:30.398
Dante says that this is all
from the Ethics of

00:53:30.398 --> 00:53:32.369
Aristotle and then Dante
wonders,

00:53:32.369 --> 00:53:36.833
look, he'll say,
lines 90: "Oh Sun that

00:53:36.833 --> 00:53:41.715
healest all troubled sight,
so dost thou satisfy me with a

00:53:41.715 --> 00:53:45.128
resolving of my doubts that it
is no less grateful to me to

00:53:45.128 --> 00:53:46.599
question than to know.
 

00:53:46.599 --> 00:53:50.579
Turn back again a little',
I said,' to the point."

00:53:50.579 --> 00:53:52.679
You know he's been explaining
everything;

00:53:52.679 --> 00:53:54.829
actually he didn't explain
everything.

00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:58.831
He never explained heresy,
which we took some time to talk

00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:01.500
about and he never really
explains--

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.626
Dante tells him,
you never really say anything

00:54:03.626 --> 00:54:04.289
about usury.
 

00:54:04.289 --> 00:54:07.496
The point that's,
"the usury offends Divine

00:54:07.496 --> 00:54:10.090
Goodness, and loose that
knot."

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.889
Why is usury--what is usury
exactly?

00:54:12.889 --> 00:54:17.429
The question is why does Dante
ask this question of usury?

00:54:17.429 --> 00:54:19.250
How does he answer it?
 

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:21.300
We can understand why he asks
about it.

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:24.050
How does he answer what usury
is?

00:54:24.050 --> 00:54:28.210
Let me just read this passage
lines 98 and following:

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.862
"'Philosophy,
for one who understands,' he

00:54:31.862 --> 00:54:35.027
said to me,
'notes, not in one place only,

00:54:35.027 --> 00:54:39.150
how nature takes her course
from the divine mind and its

00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:41.572
art,
and if thou note well thy

00:54:41.572 --> 00:54:45.219
Physics,"
another text of Aristotle,

00:54:45.219 --> 00:54:49.139
the Ethics is mentioned
for us,

00:54:49.139 --> 00:54:51.552
now the Physics,
"thou wilt find not many

00:54:51.552 --> 00:54:53.405
pages on,
that your art,

00:54:53.405 --> 00:54:57.851
as far as it can,
follows nature as the pupil the

00:54:57.851 --> 00:55:00.753
master,
so that your art is to God,

00:55:00.753 --> 00:55:02.570
as it were, a grandchild.
 

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:05.275
By these two,
if you recall to mind

00:55:05.275 --> 00:55:08.817
Genesis,
near the beginning,"

00:55:08.817 --> 00:55:12.815
the biblical book of Genesis,
"it behoves mankind to

00:55:12.815 --> 00:55:15.179
gain their livelihood and their
advancement,

00:55:15.179 --> 00:55:19.090
and because the usurer takes
another way he despises nature,

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:21.650
both in herself and in her
follower,

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:25.099
setting his hope elsewhere.
 

00:55:25.099 --> 00:55:27.619
But now follow me,
for I would go;

00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:30.972
the Fishes are quivering on the
horizon and all the Wain lies

00:55:30.972 --> 00:55:33.934
over Caurus and farther on there
is the descent of the

00:55:33.934 --> 00:55:37.702
cliff.'"
To explain the sin of usury,

00:55:37.702 --> 00:55:41.059
Dante puts forth a theory of
art.

00:55:41.059 --> 00:55:46.722
That's what's happening,
as if usury were a violation of

00:55:46.722 --> 00:55:47.340
art.
 

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:48.690
How does he understand art?
 

00:55:48.690 --> 00:55:51.449
Art, what is art?
 

00:55:51.449 --> 00:55:55.521
He understands art as work,
that's the best way to explain

00:55:55.521 --> 00:55:55.880
it.
 

00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:00.059
Talking about the beginning of
Genesis when a human being--

00:56:00.059 --> 00:56:03.677
when Adam was thrown out of the
Garden of Eden and was told that

00:56:03.677 --> 00:56:06.625
in order to recover,
retrieve the garden,

00:56:06.625 --> 00:56:10.481
he had to go back to work,
that work becomes an

00:56:10.481 --> 00:56:12.619
ascetic--not a punishment.
 

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:16.300
Here Dante doesn't see work as
a punishment,

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:21.606
but an ascetic exercise whereby
one can regain or transform the

00:56:21.606 --> 00:56:24.090
wilderness into paradise.
 

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:27.661
That's really the idea,
but I think there is more that

00:56:27.661 --> 00:56:30.289
is happening here in this
connection.

00:56:30.289 --> 00:56:33.639
This is the general thrust of
the canto.

00:56:33.639 --> 00:56:35.059
What is art in the Middle Ages?
 

00:56:35.059 --> 00:56:37.416
You may want to know because
first of all,

00:56:37.416 --> 00:56:40.059
I did say that there is a
general coherence.

00:56:40.059 --> 00:56:43.873
You remember those were my
initial words when I started

00:56:43.873 --> 00:56:46.840
today's class from Canto IX to
Canto XI?

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.960
Art is understood by the
Scholastics as a virtue of the

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:56.036
practical intellect,
in the order of making,

00:56:56.036 --> 00:56:59.829
a virtue of the practical
intellect.

00:56:59.829 --> 00:57:02.039
You may go, what is this
practical intellect?

00:57:02.039 --> 00:57:03.340
How many intellects do we have?
 

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.789
Well there's a speculative
intellect.

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:08.577
When Dante talks about the
immortality of the soul and

00:57:08.577 --> 00:57:11.679
those who do not believe in the
immortality of the soul,

00:57:11.679 --> 00:57:13.940
that's a question of the
speculative intellect.

00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:18.894
If I went on thinking about
God, suppose that I had this

00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:22.768
weakness of mine to think about
justice,

00:57:22.768 --> 00:57:25.027
for instance,
an abstract of idea,

00:57:25.027 --> 00:57:27.063
justice,
not particular cases of

00:57:27.063 --> 00:57:30.353
justice, then I'm involved in an
exercise of the speculative

00:57:30.353 --> 00:57:31.079
intellect.
 

00:57:31.079 --> 00:57:36.139
He ends the canto with the
practical intellect,

00:57:36.139 --> 00:57:40.632
an emphasis on the practical
intellect is the mind that

00:57:40.632 --> 00:57:45.559
worries about doing or making,
and they are not the same thing.

00:57:45.559 --> 00:57:46.579
What is the difference?
 

00:57:46.579 --> 00:57:49.974
To say that there is a practice
intellect in the order of doing

00:57:49.974 --> 00:57:52.820
would be to worry about when you
talk about prudence:

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:57.188
a virtue of doing,
because it's not the artisan's

00:57:57.188 --> 00:57:57.809
work.
 

00:57:57.809 --> 00:58:01.110
To say that it's a virtue of
practical intellect in the order

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:04.355
of making, it means that the
work of art is a thing that one

00:58:04.355 --> 00:58:05.179
elaborates.
 

00:58:05.179 --> 00:58:09.119
From this point of view,
the issue is never really one

00:58:09.119 --> 00:58:12.389
of--does it tell the truth about
whatever.

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:16.096
It has its own thingness;
it's a thing,

00:58:16.096 --> 00:58:19.677
the work of art is something
made and therefore as made,

00:58:19.677 --> 00:58:22.476
it has its own reality;
it has its own laws;

00:58:22.476 --> 00:58:24.170
it has its own rigor.
 

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.820
That's one thing.
 

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:30.304
It's work, but look at all the
images that Dante is using to

00:58:30.304 --> 00:58:32.280
reflect on this problem.
 

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.460
"Philosophy,
for one who understands,' he

00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:36.913
said to me,
'notes, not in one place only,

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:40.460
how nature takes a course from
the divine mind and its art.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:44.760
And if thou know well thy
Physics,"

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.780
which is it's a theory of
nature really,

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:52.125
it's a theory of motion,
it's a theory of how things

00:58:52.125 --> 00:58:54.706
grow,
how things are born,

00:58:54.706 --> 00:59:00.226
grow, and perish,
"thou will find not many

00:59:00.226 --> 00:59:03.402
pages on,
that your art as far it can,

00:59:03.402 --> 00:59:06.070
follows nature as the pupil the
master,

00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:08.590
so your art is to God as it
were a grandchild."

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:12.141
I just want to talk about these
metaphors here to make you

00:59:12.141 --> 00:59:15.320
understand what Dante--how Dante
understands art.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:18.425
On the face of it,
he's saying that art must be an

00:59:18.425 --> 00:59:19.820
imitation of nature.
 

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:21.969
You have followed nature.
 

00:59:21.969 --> 00:59:26.579
Does Dante then have a mimetic
idea of art?

00:59:26.579 --> 00:59:32.079
Not at all, not at all,
because look at the metaphors

00:59:32.079 --> 00:59:35.039
he's using: two metaphors.
 

00:59:35.039 --> 00:59:38.570
"Your art,
as far as it can,

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:42.800
follows nature as the pupil the
master,

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:47.211
so that your art is to God as
it were a grandchild"

00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:51.920
because art follows nature,
nature is the child of God,

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.302
so art is a grandchild,
but it's an image of fecundity

00:59:57.302 --> 00:59:58.929
and fertility.
 

00:59:58.929 --> 01:00:02.726
You can understand why Dante
opposes art, finally,

01:00:02.726 --> 01:00:03.579
to usury.
 

01:00:03.579 --> 01:00:07.496
Usury is viewed as the activity
that is sterile,

01:00:07.496 --> 01:00:10.913
an activity that produces
what's symbolic,

01:00:10.913 --> 01:00:12.829
money out of money.
 

01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:15.860
So it's a symbolic kind of
operation;

01:00:15.860 --> 01:00:19.059
as opposed to it,
Dante--opposes to it,

01:00:19.059 --> 01:00:22.369
Dante casts the virtue of art
as work,

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:25.300
but one of production,
one of generation:

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.940
the "grandchild"
of God.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.650
Art is the grandchild of God.
 

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:31.219
Then there is this other
metaphor,

01:00:31.219 --> 01:00:34.463
"as the pupil follows the
master,"

01:00:34.463 --> 01:00:37.329
which is not a gratuitous
metaphor,

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:39.079
because after all within the
context,

01:00:39.079 --> 01:00:41.739
here Dante has Virgil who is
teaching him,

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:45.070
so there is almost a kind of
flattery, if you wish.

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:48.250
One little detail,
he's flattering the

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:49.539
relationship.
 

01:00:49.539 --> 01:00:52.570
He acknowledges his
discipleship to Virgil,

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:56.612
which he does all the time,
but it implies the educational

01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:59.717
aspect of art,
in the most etymological sense

01:00:59.717 --> 01:01:00.539
of the term.
 

01:01:00.539 --> 01:01:04.800
Art educates,
in the sense that it leads us

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.773
out of a particular state of
barbarity, ignorance,

01:01:09.773 --> 01:01:11.599
darkness, etc.
 

01:01:11.599 --> 01:01:16.596
So it has an educational and a
non-mimetic role,

01:01:16.596 --> 01:01:21.806
because art imitates the
productive rhythms of the

01:01:21.806 --> 01:01:23.719
natural world.
 

01:01:23.719 --> 01:01:28.914
Dante views an art that is open
to beginnings,

01:01:28.914 --> 01:01:30.070
to life.
 

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:33.369
This is the meaning of Genesis,
the idea of Genesis,

01:01:33.369 --> 01:01:36.369
an art that always--that is
original,

01:01:36.369 --> 01:01:39.889
but not in a romantic sense of
originality,

01:01:39.889 --> 01:01:44.670
but an art that leads us back
to the thought of origins.

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:49.565
The thought of how things come
into being because only then,

01:01:49.565 --> 01:01:53.050
do we understand how--what the
ends are.

01:01:53.050 --> 01:01:56.369
To understand the ends,
we got to know something about

01:01:56.369 --> 01:01:59.063
the beginnings,
about the seeds that make us

01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:01.570
whatever it is that we think we
are.

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:06.039
We have gone then from Canto IX
to Canto XI,

01:02:06.039 --> 01:02:09.268
from concerns about the pride
of the mind,

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:16.045
which we could even call the
wound of the intellect and the

01:02:16.045 --> 01:02:21.166
weakness of the will,
to the view that really is no

01:02:21.166 --> 01:02:26.123
distinction between an Epicurean
thinking about oneself and the

01:02:26.123 --> 01:02:30.199
state and distinct from some
kind of theorizing.

01:02:30.199 --> 01:02:36.090
Dante sees a connection between
them, to finally an idea of art.

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:41.829
And I think that this idea of
art is also for Dante remedial

01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:46.110
for the evils that--to which we
are prone.

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:50.380
Dante thinks that should we
apply to ourselves the same kind

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:55.230
of care and rigor with which an
artist produces the work of art,

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:59.025
then what we call the
cultivation of the soul may

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:01.320
indeed begin to take place.
 

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:07.460
Art--Dante's attention to art
is part of this ascetic

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.760
exercise.
 

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.070
Let me finish here and we'll
give another few minutes--

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:16.018
I touched on a number of issues
and I'm anxious to hear your

01:03:16.018 --> 01:03:19.023
perplexities,
questions, comments,

01:03:19.023 --> 01:03:21.250
suggestions,
whatever.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:26.789
Yes?
 

01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:29.195
Student:  With the
heretics, he makes it so clear

01:03:29.195 --> 01:03:31.166
that they sin,
because it's both intellect and

01:03:31.166 --> 01:03:31.559
will.
 

01:03:31.559 --> 01:03:34.963
It's because--with the heretics
he makes it clear that they sin

01:03:34.963 --> 01:03:37.050
both because of intellect and
will,

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:39.550
it's not just because they're
thinking something false.

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:42.485
Prof: The question is,
with the heretics that we are

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.320
not really dealing only with the
question of thought,

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.952
or it's a freedom of thought,
but it deals with the fact the

01:03:50.952 --> 01:03:56.273
heretics are engaged in act of--
acts of intellect which are

01:03:56.273 --> 01:03:59.809
supported or shaped by also acts
of the will;

01:03:59.809 --> 01:04:01.929
that was exactly what I
maintained.

01:04:01.929 --> 01:04:04.052
Student:  Then that
makes sense, but then does he

01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:05.559
ever really try and explain to
them--

01:04:05.559 --> 01:04:08.454
I mean everyone wonders about
the virtuous paintings and why

01:04:08.454 --> 01:04:10.733
they're there,
and it seems that theirs is

01:04:10.733 --> 01:04:13.891
just a failure of intellect and
there's really no failure of

01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:14.320
will.
 

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:17.880
Prof: For the--for Dante
you mean?

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:18.429
Student:  Yes.
 

01:04:18.429 --> 01:04:20.489
Prof: The question is
about the pagans,

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:24.590
does Dante think that theirs is
not just the failure--

01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:26.938
if I understood the question,
the failure of the intellect

01:04:26.938 --> 01:04:28.380
but also the failure of the
will.

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.268
Yes, I think that this is the
case.

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:35.539
We shall see a number of pagans
where probably we can

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:39.317
highlight--we can see
highlighted some of these

01:04:39.317 --> 01:04:41.369
concerns that he has.
 

01:04:41.369 --> 01:04:47.902
Concerns--you will read Ulysses
who is represented as engaged in

01:04:47.902 --> 01:04:53.190
a flight of the mind,
the wings of the intellect.

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:56.777
You know they are wings of
desire, Platonic wings of

01:04:56.777 --> 01:04:57.409
desire.
 

01:04:57.409 --> 01:05:02.052
And then Francesca,
Canto V, remember she is like a

01:05:02.052 --> 01:05:06.137
dove, etc., called by desire,
the open wings,

01:05:06.137 --> 01:05:09.110
clearly the wings of desire.
 

01:05:09.110 --> 01:05:13.588
And then in the case of
Ulysses, you're going to have

01:05:13.588 --> 01:05:18.414
the wings of the intellect,
the mind that tries to reach,

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:20.739
the flight of the mind.
 

01:05:20.739 --> 01:05:27.090
He too, appears as a
rhetorician.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.842
That is to say,
it would seem that we like to

01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:33.409
believe that there is a
distinction between let's say,

01:05:33.409 --> 01:05:36.980
a metaphysical,
it's a little bit physics,

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:40.869
as a kind of metaphysical
intellectual flight and Dante's

01:05:40.869 --> 01:05:44.588
always saying,
look, is always trying to probe

01:05:44.588 --> 01:05:50.034
the presence of passions,
the rhetorical aspect of the

01:05:50.034 --> 01:05:56.909
claims to reach the truth,
or the plain of truth.

01:05:56.909 --> 01:05:59.889
Yes, am I answering your
question?

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:02.413
Student:  Yes,
I mean it's also just they were

01:06:02.413 --> 01:06:04.942
put there because they did--
Christ hadn't come yet,

01:06:04.942 --> 01:06:06.760
which is why they were still in
Hell,

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.860
why Virgil came to Hell?
 

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.510
I'm just wondering is that
like--

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:13.639
Prof: Okay, good.
 

01:06:13.639 --> 01:06:18.639
I have been missing the mark in
answering and the question

01:06:18.639 --> 01:06:21.784
really is how--
are the pagans in Hell because

01:06:21.784 --> 01:06:25.039
Christ had not yet come and in
what way did they violate--

01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:27.512
Student:  That just
seems the failure of intellect

01:06:27.512 --> 01:06:28.987
rather than--
Prof: The failure of

01:06:28.987 --> 01:06:29.300
intellect?
 

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.650
No, the answer is no.
 

01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:35.851
Let me give you a general idea
of why it's no,

01:06:35.851 --> 01:06:38.559
and then a particular idea.
 

01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:42.036
First of all,
generally, if Dante were to

01:06:42.036 --> 01:06:44.992
judge and he does,
judge the world,

01:06:44.992 --> 01:06:49.860
the culture of let's say
Greek--the classical world.

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.210
He puts most of it in Limbo.
 

01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:55.300
That's a judgment,
saying you're really marginal,

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.619
you're really liminal to my
story.

01:06:57.619 --> 01:07:01.456
That's what he's saying,
though in Paradise he will go

01:07:01.456 --> 01:07:06.016
out of the way to reclaim Plato,
Aristotle, and all the possible

01:07:06.016 --> 01:07:07.320
Aristotelians.
 

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.126
If he were to do that from a
perspective which is outside,

01:07:12.126 --> 01:07:16.090
he really would be a boring
poet, in my view.

01:07:16.090 --> 01:07:19.599
You don't believe in the
immortality of the soul,

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:22.159
as if he were saying to
Epicurus.

01:07:22.159 --> 01:07:26.461
I do, you are a fool and
therefore I am saved and you--I

01:07:26.461 --> 01:07:27.869
put you in Hell.
 

01:07:27.869 --> 01:07:32.539
That's really not worthy of a
great mind,

01:07:32.539 --> 01:07:34.800
because one can imagine
Epicurus saying,

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.429
well you are the fool and you
think you are saved,

01:07:36.429 --> 01:07:38.601
I know what I have been doing.
 

01:07:38.601 --> 01:07:40.050
You can take sides.
 

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:42.994
Dante never does that,
what he does do is take the

01:07:42.994 --> 01:07:45.400
perspective of the sinners
themselves.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.322
Let them talk and gives them a
rope with which they hang

01:07:49.322 --> 01:07:50.250
themselves.
 

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:53.932
That's really what's happening,
that's the best way to present

01:07:53.932 --> 01:07:54.900
this argument.
 

01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.164
He's not judging the pagans,
now I'm coming straight to your

01:07:58.164 --> 01:08:00.543
question,
he's not judging the pagans

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:04.159
from a Christian standpoint
alone that is outside of it.

01:08:04.159 --> 01:08:08.686
For a number of reasons,
because he believes actually

01:08:08.686 --> 01:08:13.300
that whatever--that the pagans
are adumbrations of the

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:16.868
Christian view,
the Christian vision.

01:08:16.868 --> 01:08:18.953
They are not just
"other"

01:08:18.953 --> 01:08:21.038
to be rejected,
on the contrary.

01:08:21.038 --> 01:08:24.935
And then in particular I can
say, that Dante will go on

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:27.750
praising some pagans among the
saved.

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:32.868
He even praises one figure the
so-called Ripheus,

01:08:32.868 --> 01:08:36.800
who was only mentioned once,
and we know nothing about him,

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:41.130
a Roman who was a sailor
in--with Aeneas,

01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:47.029
and only because Virgil refers
to him as justus Ripheus,

01:08:47.029 --> 01:08:49.618
the just Ripheus,
which is, to me,

01:08:49.618 --> 01:08:53.862
a way which Dante says,
not just the kings but every

01:08:53.862 --> 01:08:58.563
simple,
humble worker can also be

01:08:58.563 --> 01:09:02.456
saved, Trajan,
the emperor Trajan and so on

01:09:02.456 --> 01:09:03.840
and a number of other cases.
 

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.345
In the case of Virgil,
I'm not going to go there

01:09:07.345 --> 01:09:11.823
because I'm going to be on TV
for the next six months I don't

01:09:11.823 --> 01:09:14.417
know,
because reams of books have

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:17.840
been written by people who wish
to see him saved.

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:21.662
I mean that's such a good guy
throughout Inferno and

01:09:21.662 --> 01:09:25.420
Purgatorio and the people
who go on arguing that he

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:27.198
might--he may be saved.
 

01:09:27.198 --> 01:09:31.054
One thing we know is that he
comes as far as the Garden of

01:09:31.054 --> 01:09:34.569
Eden and just as Beatrice is
going to arrive then the

01:09:34.569 --> 01:09:36.250
pilgrim,
the lover now,

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:38.880
Dante trembles at the idea that
here she is,

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:44.345
the destination of his journey,
and he needs the help of

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:45.238
Virgil.
 

01:09:45.238 --> 01:09:48.090
He turns around and his eyes
will never see him again.

01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:50.132
He had vanished,
so we know that,

01:09:50.132 --> 01:09:54.027
there is a kind--that seems to
be the limitation of how far he

01:09:54.027 --> 01:09:54.729
can go.
 

01:09:54.729 --> 01:09:59.824
To say this is really to say
very little, because within

01:09:59.824 --> 01:10:03.439
Dante's cosmos,
Dante has an idea of the

01:10:03.439 --> 01:10:05.569
curvature of space.
 

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:07.359
This is the sphere.
 

01:10:07.359 --> 01:10:13.421
A redemption means that all
things will go back to the

01:10:13.421 --> 01:10:16.627
beginning,
that's what happens,

01:10:16.627 --> 01:10:19.550
so only from that point of
view,

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:24.130
we don't have a lot of thematic
reflections about this aspect,

01:10:24.130 --> 01:10:26.680
who is going to be saved at the
end of that, who knows.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:30.367
The whole question is the
unfathomable quality of God's

01:10:30.367 --> 01:10:31.050
justice.
 

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:34.890
Dante wonders though,
we're talking about Christ and

01:10:34.890 --> 01:10:39.032
Christ, and what about the
in--those living in--near the

01:10:39.032 --> 01:10:40.840
banks of the Hindus?
 

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.340
They never heard the name of
Christ?

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.658
Are they going to be saved?
 

01:10:43.658 --> 01:10:46.340
They are just,
can they be condemned?

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.590
These are questions that he
will not answer.

01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:50.720
He raises these questions in
Paradise.

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.810
You're a little bit impatient I
say but that's--

01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:56.850
I think that from the point of
view of eschatology,

01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:00.622
he must have an idea
of--otherwise Redemption has

01:11:00.622 --> 01:11:01.328
failed.
 

01:11:01.328 --> 01:11:04.751
If some people are damned then
there is no Redemption,

01:11:04.751 --> 01:11:06.430
you see what I'm saying?
 

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:12.067
The measure in which evil--if
you get into this metaphysical

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:17.130
framework,
if there is going to be

01:11:17.130 --> 01:11:23.149
residues of sin,
then there is also residue of

01:11:23.149 --> 01:11:24.300
injustice.
 

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:27.710
I don't know that I answered
your question.

01:11:27.710 --> 01:11:33.210
I think I did but--Yes?
 

01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:34.578
Student:  Thinking about
the Medusa,

01:11:34.578 --> 01:11:37.630
I understand the idea of Medusa
as an allegory for the mediation

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:40.240
of poetry,
but is it also a connection

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:44.788
between the figure of the woman
and the act of petrification?

01:11:44.788 --> 01:11:48.403
Thinking about the Donna Petra,
I'm wondering if Dante's also

01:11:48.403 --> 01:11:51.774
saying something about the
dangers of love or the dangers

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.100
of misplaced love.
 

01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.920
Prof: Thank you.
 

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.905
The question is about the story
of the Medusa and the part about

01:11:59.905 --> 01:12:04.260
the mediation of poetry to
conquer Medusa is clear,

01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:10.788
but the question also wonders
whether this has to do with,

01:12:10.788 --> 01:12:12.650
first of all,
the fact that the Medusa is a

01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:16.551
woman,
and also that petrification is

01:12:16.551 --> 01:12:20.869
the petrification of misplaced
love.

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:22.529
Is that an accurate paraphrase?
 

01:12:22.529 --> 01:12:23.078
Student: 
&gt;

01:12:23.078 --> 01:12:25.412
Prof: Okay,
the answer is that's a great

01:12:25.412 --> 01:12:25.970
question.
 

01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:32.176
I sense there your awareness of
the Freudian reading of the myth

01:12:32.176 --> 01:12:37.444
of the Medusa as castration,
as indeed a kind of

01:12:37.444 --> 01:12:42.796
literalization of the threat,
at least, not castration but

01:12:42.796 --> 01:12:46.578
the threat of castration on the
male from the point of view of

01:12:46.578 --> 01:12:47.198
Medusa.
 

01:12:47.198 --> 01:12:53.060
I will take the second part of
your remark to explain also the

01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:54.310
first part.
 

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:57.229
I think that this is a question
of misdirected love,

01:12:57.229 --> 01:13:02.045
but what Dante has seen--I
would urge you to go and read

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:08.430
the poems about this lady Petra,
the lady of stone--because they

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:15.181
are poems where Dante literally
engages in fantasies of violence

01:13:15.181 --> 01:13:16.788
against her.
 

01:13:16.788 --> 01:13:21.307
If I could get my hands on her
with a passion,

01:13:21.307 --> 01:13:26.930
unrequited makes him--it's
almost like a sort of sadistic

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:29.140
coloring about it.
 

01:13:29.140 --> 01:13:31.399
I think it's clearly
misdirected love.

01:13:31.399 --> 01:13:37.364
What he understands though is
the kind of death that that sort

01:13:37.364 --> 01:13:41.180
of desperate love has brought to
him.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:44.380
You call that--you can view
that death as the fear of

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.180
castration.
 

01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:49.726
I think it's an extreme version
of that, so I would agree with

01:13:49.726 --> 01:13:52.560
what I hear is behind your
question.

01:13:55.989 --> 01:13:56.439
Yes?
 

01:13:56.439 --> 01:14:00.599
Student:  So why does he
draw us into that allegory of

01:14:00.599 --> 01:14:02.538
Medusa and petrified love?
 

01:14:02.538 --> 01:14:05.594
Prof: Well he-- I--you
mean if it's--the question is

01:14:05.594 --> 01:14:08.805
why does he draw us into that
allegory if it's about petrified

01:14:08.805 --> 01:14:09.279
love?
 

01:14:09.279 --> 01:14:12.680
Right, this is the question and
I presume--

01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:14.130
I don't want to explain your
question,

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:17.619
I have to answer your question,
but I presume that your

01:14:17.619 --> 01:14:22.760
question stems from your--
this kind of concern you have.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.578
If it's such a private story,
why us?

01:14:25.578 --> 01:14:27.880
In what way are we involved in
that?

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.470
This is his story, right?
 

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:32.569
The answer that I could give is
yes,

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:36.353
this is--can be seen as Dante's
own confession and the

01:14:36.353 --> 01:14:40.850
confession and that's why I read
the passage from Augustine,

01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:43.006
from Augustine's own
Confessions:

01:14:43.006 --> 01:14:45.658
a confession that can also be
exemplary to us.

01:14:45.658 --> 01:14:49.639
And because he thinks,
I think, that there are no

01:14:49.639 --> 01:14:54.033
experiences that are irreducibly
private and therefore

01:14:54.033 --> 01:14:55.359
unshareable.
 

01:14:55.359 --> 01:14:59.421
It's part of the concern of
this writing--of this writer,

01:14:59.421 --> 01:15:03.627
that anything that will happen
to him we are--I have to say

01:15:03.627 --> 01:15:04.279
this.
 

01:15:04.279 --> 01:15:08.872
We are going to find moments
when he tells us its night

01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:13.381
dreams, pretty heavy night
dreams, but treated with an

01:15:13.381 --> 01:15:16.189
extraordinary,
I think, care.

01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:19.680
We are going to have his--we
are going to enter into his

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.170
psyche, why part of--way of
entering into his psyche?

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:28.578
Because he has to understand
not only how shareable his

01:15:28.578 --> 01:15:32.885
experience is,
but also, what is the root of

01:15:32.885 --> 01:15:35.890
the way we make decisions?
 

01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:40.899
Do--can we really be ever all
the time vigilant?

01:15:40.899 --> 01:15:42.060
This is in the case of the
dream.

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:46.439
Am I responsible if I perceive
the world in a certain way?

01:15:46.439 --> 01:15:49.930
Am I responsible if dreams come
to me in a certain way?

01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:52.368
Then, am I accountable for this
kind of dreams?

01:15:52.368 --> 01:15:57.159
The concern is always that of
trying to delimit an area where

01:15:57.159 --> 01:16:01.470
there is some common ground
between his experiences and

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:05.274
ours,
and that's the transaction of

01:16:05.274 --> 01:16:06.310
allegory.
 

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.529
Yes?
 

01:16:12.529 --> 01:16:14.038
Student:  At the end of
Canto IX,

01:16:14.038 --> 01:16:17.363
I don't know if it's
significant, but Dante turns to

01:16:17.363 --> 01:16:20.100
the right as he enters the City
of Dis,

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.898
did you find that significant
just going back to what we

01:16:22.898 --> 01:16:24.170
talked about last time?
 

01:16:24.170 --> 01:16:27.560
Prof: Of course,
this is fantastic.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:34.051
The question is I have been
talking about the fact that in

01:16:34.051 --> 01:16:38.720
Inferno Dante goes to the
left,

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:42.738
seems to--which I also said
though that that is really very

01:16:42.738 --> 01:16:47.404
difficult to visualize,
so we say counter-clockwise or

01:16:47.404 --> 01:16:50.832
clockwise,
that his descent is clockwise

01:16:50.832 --> 01:16:52.328
in Inferno.
 

01:16:52.328 --> 01:16:57.149
And yet, I'm so grateful to you
for noticing this.

01:16:57.149 --> 01:17:00.969
Here in Inferno IX,
Dante actually goes out of the

01:17:00.969 --> 01:17:04.380
way to say that he turned to the
right and the--

01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:08.024
I don't have a position of my
own on this but there will also

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:11.257
be--
well this is to emphasize that

01:17:11.257 --> 01:17:16.038
heresy is primarily the disease
of the intellect.

01:17:16.038 --> 01:17:19.190
You remember that I specified
that there is the will and the

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:21.806
intellect, and the will is
always the left and the

01:17:21.806 --> 01:17:23.250
intellect is the right.
 

01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:30.037
I think that Dante is--this is
the point where Dante is

01:17:30.037 --> 01:17:31.420
sleeping.
 

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:35.136
It happened to Homer
occasionally to fall asleep and

01:17:35.136 --> 01:17:39.510
this is the only time that you
have caught him dozing off.

01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:42.000
Thank you so much we'll see you
next time.

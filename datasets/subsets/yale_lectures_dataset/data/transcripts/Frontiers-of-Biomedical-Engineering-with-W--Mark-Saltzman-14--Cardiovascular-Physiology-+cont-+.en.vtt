00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.430
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, we're going to continue

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.620
the discussion of cardiovascular
physiology today.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.071
In particular,
pay attention to the heart and

00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:22.802
its role in creating the
pressure that moves blood

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:24.920
throughout the circulatory
system.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.923
I'm going to take a step back
and let's review what we talked

00:00:28.923 --> 00:00:32.125
about at the end,
and then we'll get into the new

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:33.660
material for today.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.700
The heart is an element of
the circulatory system.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.657
It's a critical element,
obviously and it--you can show

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:48.619
it, as in this picture,
in the center of the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:51.894
circulatory system where its
role is to supply the pressure

00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:55.000
drop that moves blood through
what's called the systemic

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.597
circulation,
or the circulation to all of

00:00:57.597 --> 00:01:00.755
the tissues in the body,
the circulation of oxygen rich

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:04.439
blood to all the tissues in the
body flowing from the aorta,

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.951
through arteries,
through arterioles,

00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:09.602
capillaries,
collecting venules back to

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.950
veins,
back to the heart.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.733
The second circulatory system,
the pulmonary circulatory

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.209
system, which sends
de-oxygenated,

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.401
or oxygen-poor blood,
through the lungs,

00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:24.920
through the pulmonary artery,
arterioles,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.466
capillaries,
veins, back through the

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:33.230
pulmonary vein to the left side
of the heart.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.299
One can think about the heart
as two functioning units that

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.642
are coupled in some way.
We're going to see that they're

00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:46.745
coupled in almost every way.
They're coupled because the

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:50.150
output from one side of the
heart is the input to the other

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.127
side.
The output from the left side

00:01:52.127 --> 00:01:55.142
of the heart goes through this
circuit and then back to the

00:01:55.142 --> 00:01:57.230
right side.
The output from the right side

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.770
goes through this circuit and
then back to the left side,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.839
and so they're coupled.
They're also coupled because

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:05.943
it's one organ,
and so when this organ performs

00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:08.439
its function which is
contraction,

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:13.045
these things are happening
simultaneously because it's one

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:16.520
individual organ that's
accomplishing it.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.197
We talked briefly about the
anatomy of the heart and I

00:02:20.197 --> 00:02:22.520
brought a model of the heart
here,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.179
larger than actual size but
with an--so it's not like a real

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.731
heart in that way.
It's also not like a real heart

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:30.889
because you can open it up and
take a look inside.

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.883
I'm going to bring this to
section if you want to look at

00:02:33.883 --> 00:02:36.610
it or you can come up and look
at it after class.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.539
To illustrate some of the
features that are shown in this

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.978
cartoon, that there's a
difference in the muscular

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:47.250
walls.
That the left side of the heart

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.307
has a thicker muscle than the
right side of the heart and that

00:02:52.307 --> 00:02:56.370
there are vessels on the surface
of the heart,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.190
so vessels that come off of the
aorta, for example,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.743
the red vessels here that serve
the myocardium or the surface of

00:03:02.743 --> 00:03:05.000
the heart and supply it with
oxygen.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.552
That the right and left side of
the heart is divided into two

00:03:07.552 --> 00:03:10.225
chambers.
On the left side there's the

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:13.691
left ventricle,
and the left atrium above it,

00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:17.000
right ventricle,
right atrium above it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.190
If we look inside there are
valves that guard the entrances

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.499
between these compartments.
There's a valve in going from

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:30.441
the right atrium to the right
ventricle--I'm just going to put

00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:35.545
all the names up on the--there's
a valve in going from the right

00:03:35.545 --> 00:03:40.406
atrium to the right ventricle
and that's called the tricuspid

00:03:40.406 --> 00:03:43.220
valve.
There's a valve in going from

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.558
the right ventricle into the
pulmonary artery and that's

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:50.512
called the pulmonary valve.
You can't see it very well here

00:03:50.512 --> 00:03:53.509
but it's up here.
There's a valve in going from

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:57.029
the left atrium into the left
ventricle and that's call the

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:59.503
mitral valve,
and a valve in going from the

00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:02.770
left atrium into the aorta and
that's called the aortic valve.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.187
There's four valves that are
important and they guard the

00:04:06.187 --> 00:04:08.741
entrances.
One of the key things we're

00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:12.720
going to talk about today is the
function of these valves in

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.822
producing a flow.
You know that the heart

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:19.521
functions, it creates pressure
by beating, by contracting,

00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:22.331
it beats.
How is pressure generated when

00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:25.328
that happens?
You know that blood moves,

00:04:25.328 --> 00:04:28.480
blood flows because of a
pressure drop.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.003
We talked last time about the
relationship between a pressure

00:04:33.003 --> 00:04:35.682
drop and a flow.
Whenever there's a pressure

00:04:35.682 --> 00:04:38.816
drop if there is the possibility
of flow, there's some resistance

00:04:38.816 --> 00:04:41.261
to that flow,
and a certain amount of flow is

00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.460
created which depends on the
resistance.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.819
Resistance goes up;
flow goes down for a fixed

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.949
pressure drop.
Resistance goes down;

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.850
flow goes up for a fixed
pressure drop.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.139
The pressure drop is what
creates the flow.

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.810
You also know that pressure
varies with volume.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.517
If I have a container that
contains a liquid or a gas and I

00:05:02.517 --> 00:05:06.820
compress the container the
pressure goes up inside.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.428
Why is that?
Why does pressure go up as

00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:13.511
volume goes down?
The most simple system to think

00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:19.850
about is an ideal gas.
Ideal gas: PV = nRT;

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:27.750
an ideal gas pressure times the
volume = nRT.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.245
If temperature,
the gas constant,

00:05:30.245 --> 00:05:34.848
and the number of molecules are
constant, then when pressure

00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:38.690
goes up volume has to go down;
volume goes down,

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.790
pressure goes up.
Why is that?

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:41.780
What's happening inside?

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:49.848
Brian?Student:
Normal activity can delay

00:05:49.848 --> 00:05:54.171
[inaudible].Professor
Mark Saltzman: Right,

00:05:54.171 --> 00:05:56.378
exactly.
The molecules are closer

00:05:56.378 --> 00:05:59.552
together, they're closer to the
walls, the force of pressure is

00:05:59.552 --> 00:06:02.470
created by collisions of the
molecules with the walls.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.306
This is a very simple
description obviously,

00:06:04.306 --> 00:06:06.442
but you can imagine as the
volume goes down and the

00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:10.192
pressure goes up,
more molecules bouncing against

00:06:10.192 --> 00:06:14.500
the walls and creating pressure.
Same thing happens in a liquid;

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.481
only in a liquid the change is
not so dramatic as in an ideal

00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:20.054
gas.
In general, liquids are

00:06:20.054 --> 00:06:23.115
considered to be incompressible.
You're not pushing their

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:26.382
molecules closer together so
much because it's a condensed

00:06:26.382 --> 00:06:30.050
fluid, but pressure still varies
with volume in the same way.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.301
You can't describe it by this
equation anymore because this

00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:37.629
only applies for ideal gases,
but the same thing is true that

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:41.806
when volume goes down--the
volume and the number of

00:06:41.806 --> 00:06:45.899
molecules is fixed--then the
pressure goes up.

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:48.319
Another way of thinking
about it that is far less

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.740
scientific is--because
everybody's seen Star Wars,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:57.151
not the later imitation Star
Wars but the first one where

00:06:57.151 --> 00:07:02.189
Luke Skywalker gets trapped with
somebody.

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:05.523
I forget even--in this room,
in this garbage dump,

00:07:05.523 --> 00:07:09.801
and the walls start coming in.
As the walls start coming in,

00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:13.279
he gets more and more urgent
about getting out.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.383
His pressure is going up as the
volume is going down and the

00:07:16.383 --> 00:07:19.593
pressure to get out gets higher
and higher, it's the same kind

00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:22.656
of thing here.
Volume is decreasing,

00:07:22.656 --> 00:07:26.261
pressure goes up.
When the heart beats or

00:07:26.261 --> 00:07:30.389
contracts it decreases the
volume of these chambers.

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:34.051
When the muscle contracts it
decreases the volume of the

00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:37.411
chambers inside;
the volume of the chambers goes

00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:41.666
down and there is blood inside
and that blood gets squeezed as

00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:45.990
the pressure--as the volume goes
down the pressure goes up.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.760
That's how pressure is
generated.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.009
Why do you need valves?
Why are valves important in the

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:57.080
function of the heart?
I already alluded to the fact

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.687
that your heart cannot function
properly without valves that are

00:08:01.687 --> 00:08:06.240
acting correctly.
Why do you need a valve?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.879
Well, imagine that you had a
simpler system than your heart.

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:13.764
You had a balloon that was
attached to a garden hose and

00:08:13.764 --> 00:08:16.589
the whole thing was filled with
water.

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:20.419
If I decrease the volume of the
balloon, the pressure in the

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:23.860
balloon goes up and water goes
out the garden hose;

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:30.139
if I decrease the volume.
What if I expand it again?

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:33.866
Well, then the pressure goes
down inside the garden hose and

00:08:33.866 --> 00:08:36.139
all the water gets sucked back
in.

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:38.563
You can imagine if you had a
water hose that--or a garden

00:08:38.563 --> 00:08:41.073
hose that was hooked up to a
reservoir and a balloon on one

00:08:41.073 --> 00:08:42.599
end,
and you inflated it,

00:08:42.599 --> 00:08:44.250
and deflated it,
inflated it,

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.963
and deflated it,
you'd be pushing water out and

00:08:46.963 --> 00:08:50.620
pulling it in and it would go
back and forth in this way.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.048
If you're increasing and
decreasing the volume by the

00:08:54.048 --> 00:08:58.268
same amount you'd be pushing out
a volume of water and pulling it

00:08:58.268 --> 00:09:01.278
back in.
Now that's a kind of a flow

00:09:01.278 --> 00:09:05.785
but it's not the continuous one
directional kind of flow that we

00:09:05.785 --> 00:09:09.650
have in our circulatory systems.
That would be a--you could

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.320
imagine a circulatory system
that's based on that,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.080
where you have a heart that
pushes blood out and then sucks

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.840
it back in, and then pushes it
out and sucks it back in,

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.909
but that's not the way that the
human heart functions.

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:26.734
In order to get blood flowing
in one direction you push the

00:09:26.734 --> 00:09:30.641
blood out, you close a gate,
and then when you're

00:09:30.641 --> 00:09:34.169
re-inflating the heart the blood
can't come back.

00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:39.611
The function of these valves is
to prevent that reverse flow of

00:09:39.611 --> 00:09:44.964
blood back into the heart when
it's relaxing or increasing its

00:09:44.964 --> 00:09:47.933
volume.
The basic function of the heart

00:09:47.933 --> 00:09:50.194
is to contract,
decrease its volume,

00:09:50.194 --> 00:09:53.265
increase the pressure,
blood goes out,

00:09:53.265 --> 00:09:58.505
valve closes preventing blood
from coming back into the

00:09:58.505 --> 00:10:02.289
chamber that just ejected the
blood.

00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:05.873
Then, that chamber relaxes and
goes back to its original

00:10:05.873 --> 00:10:06.460
volume.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:12.530
That's the basic function of
the heart and we're going to

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.700
spend the rest of the time
talking about the details of how

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.377
that happens.
It's clear why valves are a

00:10:18.377 --> 00:10:20.320
necessary part of that cycle.

00:10:24.789 --> 00:10:27.070
Pressure varies throughout
the circulatory system.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:29.502
If pressure is indeed generated
in the heart,

00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:31.603
as I've said,
then you would expect the

00:10:31.603 --> 00:10:34.976
highest pressures to be in the
regions that are closest to the

00:10:34.976 --> 00:10:37.570
heart.
If I measured pressure in the

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.629
aorta, and we talked about this
last time, you would find that

00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:45.002
pressure varies with time.
Because pressure is going up

00:10:45.002 --> 00:10:47.577
and down in the heart,
that oscillation in pressure

00:10:47.577 --> 00:10:50.822
with heartbeat gets transmitted
into the aorta as well and we'll

00:10:50.822 --> 00:10:53.139
talk in a minute about why that
happens.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:57.497
If you looked over time an
average pressure in the aorta

00:10:57.497 --> 00:11:02.002
would be somewhere between 120
and 80 mmHg, so let's just call

00:11:02.002 --> 00:11:05.950
it 90 here.
The pressure in the aorta is 90.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:10.008
If you think about the whole
circuit, this blood has to flow

00:11:10.008 --> 00:11:12.416
from the aorta,
through the systemic

00:11:12.416 --> 00:11:15.649
circulation and back into the
right atrium.

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:19.327
In the right atrium it's at the
end of its journey and that

00:11:19.327 --> 00:11:21.610
pressure there is approximately
0.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.720
The pressure drop that's
driving blood through the

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.570
systemic circulatory system is
ΔP of 90-0.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.263
The pressure that's generated
here gets used completely in

00:11:39.263 --> 00:11:42.736
driving the flow around.
If I looked at intermediate

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:46.586
positions I'd find that if I
looked in the arterioles the

00:11:46.586 --> 00:11:51.131
pressure is about 35 mmHg,
so the pressure dropped from

00:11:51.131 --> 00:11:55.654
here to here is 55 mmHg.
The pressure drop from the

00:11:55.654 --> 00:11:59.279
arterioles to the venules is
about 20 mmHg,

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:04.286
and from the venules back to
the right atrium is 15-0 or 15

00:12:04.286 --> 00:12:05.150
mmHg.

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:11.490
Pressure drops throughout
the circulatory system.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:15.450
If you look on the pulmonary
side, you'll find the same

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.409
phenomenon, but in general,
the pressures are lower.

00:12:19.409 --> 00:12:23.452
The pressure in the pulmonary
artery is only about 15 mmHg,

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:27.286
dropping to about 6 mmHg in the
capillaries where oxygen

00:12:27.286 --> 00:12:32.150
exchange occurs,
dropping back to 0 when you get

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:36.298
to the left atrium.
What does that tell you about

00:12:36.298 --> 00:12:39.522
the pulmonary circulation
compared to the systemic

00:12:39.522 --> 00:12:42.543
circulation?
The pressure drop across the

00:12:42.543 --> 00:12:46.321
systemic circulation is 90 mmHg,
across the pulmonary

00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:50.710
circulation is 15 mmHg,
what does that tell you about

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.366
the pulmonary circulation in
comparison to the systemic

00:12:55.366 --> 00:12:57.687
circulation?
Justin?Student: The

00:12:57.687 --> 00:12:59.022
flow isn't as
fast.Professor Mark

00:12:59.022 --> 00:13:00.290
Saltzman: Flow is not as
fast.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.780
Is that true?

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:11.400
What do you think?

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.260
What's the flow through the
aorta?

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:24.549
It's 5L/min and I think that
was a good answer.

00:13:24.549 --> 00:13:27.465
The flow might be not as fast
because there's not as much of a

00:13:27.465 --> 00:13:30.161
pressure drop,
but we know because this is an

00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:33.186
interconnected system,
that the flow is actually

00:13:33.186 --> 00:13:36.727
5L/min at every cross--every
location in the circulatory

00:13:36.727 --> 00:13:38.856
system.
It's a continuous circuit,

00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:41.100
so the flow has to be the same
everywhere.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.515
Justin's answer was one
possibility and it's a good one,

00:13:46.515 --> 00:13:50.029
but that doesn't work in this
connected kind of a system.

00:13:50.029 --> 00:13:52.480
Then if the flow is the same
what has to be different?

00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:58.312
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Mark Saltzman:

00:13:58.312 --> 00:14:00.024
I'm sorry,
Naomi.Student: It's

00:14:00.024 --> 00:14:01.624
pulse generated,
it's not as fast and doesn't

00:14:01.624 --> 00:14:03.085
have to go to the rest of the
body.Professor Mark

00:14:03.085 --> 00:14:04.759
Saltzman: It doesn't have to
go to the rest of the body,

00:14:04.759 --> 00:14:06.659
so it doesn't have to generate
as much pressure.

00:14:06.659 --> 00:14:10.989
You're on the right track,
so what does that tell you in

00:14:10.989 --> 00:14:15.870
terms of the numbers you were
dealing with on your homework?

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.460
Which system has a higher
resistance?

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.552
The systemic system has a
higher resistance because it

00:14:25.552 --> 00:14:29.309
takes a higher pressure drop in
order to create the same flow.

00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:32.735
The systemic circulation has a
higher resistance than the

00:14:32.735 --> 00:14:35.916
pulmonary circulation--high
resistance, high pressure

00:14:35.916 --> 00:14:37.797
circuit;
low resistance,

00:14:37.797 --> 00:14:41.108
low pressure circuit.
There's consequences of

00:14:41.108 --> 00:14:42.970
that.
It sort of makes sense now that

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:45.632
you've done your homework
problem for this week that the

00:14:45.632 --> 00:14:48.537
resistance through the pulmonary
system would be less because

00:14:48.537 --> 00:14:50.570
it--you don't have so far too
travel.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.825
The blood doesn't have so far
to travel so the length is much

00:14:53.825 --> 00:14:56.429
less, you don't have to push the
blood as far,

00:14:56.429 --> 00:15:00.158
it doesn't have to go up to
your head and down to your toes

00:15:00.158 --> 00:15:03.665
and so less overall resistance.
Because it has less resistance

00:15:03.665 --> 00:15:05.419
you don't need as much pressure
drop.

00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:09.136
Because you don't need as much
pressure drop you don't need as

00:15:09.136 --> 00:15:11.937
much muscle.
I don't need to generate as

00:15:11.937 --> 00:15:14.967
high a pressure,
so the right side has less

00:15:14.967 --> 00:15:18.777
muscle mass than the left side.
The reason for more muscle mass

00:15:18.777 --> 00:15:21.405
on the left is to create the
higher pressure that's needed to

00:15:21.405 --> 00:15:23.070
drive this high resistance
circuit.

00:15:28.649 --> 00:15:32.116
This diagram shows you the
events in what's called the

00:15:32.116 --> 00:15:35.368
cardiac cycle.
The cardiac cycle is this

00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:41.201
rhythmic movement that we call a
heartbeat, and it goes through a

00:15:41.201 --> 00:15:44.198
very systematic cycle.
It's a cycle,

00:15:44.198 --> 00:15:46.409
so you could start and end it
anywhere.

00:15:46.409 --> 00:15:49.922
We're going to start in this
region of the cycle that's

00:15:49.922 --> 00:15:53.239
called late diastole,
and diastole is the relaxation

00:15:53.239 --> 00:15:55.859
phase.
Diastole is the relaxation

00:15:55.859 --> 00:15:59.250
phase;
systole is the contraction

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:02.243
phase.
In late diastole that's the

00:16:02.243 --> 00:16:06.606
moment right before the beat
starts or the contraction

00:16:06.606 --> 00:16:08.448
starts.
In late diastole,

00:16:08.448 --> 00:16:11.921
look at the situation here,
there's blood flowing back into

00:16:11.921 --> 00:16:14.148
the atria,
coming from the circulation

00:16:14.148 --> 00:16:17.419
that's driven by the pressure
created by the last heartbeat.

00:16:17.419 --> 00:16:25.370
There's some blood moving from
the atrium into the ventricle.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:30.299
That's true because this valve,
the mitral valve is open;

00:16:30.299 --> 00:16:33.729
the mitral valve is open so
blood is flowing back to the

00:16:33.729 --> 00:16:36.660
left atrium and back into the
left ventricle.

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:41.278
The heart is relaxed;
it's passively flowing into the

00:16:41.278 --> 00:16:43.880
heart.
At the beginning of

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.839
contraction--another word for
contraction is systole,

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:51.950
diastole/systole--now the heart
starts to contract,

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:54.529
but one region of the heart
starts to contract first.

00:16:54.529 --> 00:16:57.163
The contraction occurs in an
orderly fashion,

00:16:57.163 --> 00:17:00.334
it starts in the atria and it
moves to the ventricles,

00:17:00.334 --> 00:17:04.081
first the atrium contract.
If you look at this they're not

00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:06.787
very muscular,
they have muscles but they're

00:17:06.787 --> 00:17:11.088
not anything like the ventricle.
You can think of it as a weaker

00:17:11.088 --> 00:17:15.224
muscle than the ventricle is.
It contracts first and when it

00:17:15.224 --> 00:17:19.681
contracts the volume decreases.
It increases the pressure

00:17:19.681 --> 00:17:23.838
inside the atrium,
and more blood starts flowing

00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:27.200
from the atrium into the
ventricle.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.845
What happens?
This contraction decreases the

00:17:29.845 --> 00:17:33.026
volume, increases the pressure,
increases the pressure drop

00:17:33.026 --> 00:17:35.220
between the atrium and the
ventricle,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.819
and more blood gets--flows into
the ventricle.

00:17:39.819 --> 00:17:41.869
Now the contraction moves
to the ventricle.

00:17:41.869 --> 00:17:44.587
The ventricle starts to
contract, and when it contracts

00:17:44.587 --> 00:17:46.500
the pressure starts going up
inside.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:50.289
When the pressure goes up
inside the mitral valve closes.

00:17:50.289 --> 00:17:54.996
That's important because you
don't want blood to flow back

00:17:54.996 --> 00:17:58.546
into the atrium,
and back into the pulmonary

00:17:58.546 --> 00:18:01.600
vein.
The mitral valve closes and

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.306
this contraction starts in a
period called isovolumetric

00:18:06.306 --> 00:18:09.339
contraction.
This isovolumetric contraction

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:12.490
means that both of the
entrances, both the entrance and

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.940
the exit into the ventricle are
closed.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:19.002
The mitral valve is closed,
the aortic value is closed,

00:18:19.002 --> 00:18:22.914
contraction is proceeding,
so the volume is trying to

00:18:22.914 --> 00:18:27.410
decrease but it can't.
,The pressure goes up during

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:32.400
contraction to the point where
the aortic valve opens.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:40.214
This is pressurized blood which
is ejected through the aorta,

00:18:40.214 --> 00:18:45.896
flow through the aorta,
and then the aortic valve

00:18:45.896 --> 00:18:49.779
closes again when diastole is
complete.

00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:52.835
Just focus on what's
happening on the left side,

00:18:52.835 --> 00:18:56.131
the right side is doing the
same thing but just at lower

00:18:56.131 --> 00:18:58.360
pressures.
Systole begins,

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.717
atria contracts,
blood flows into the ventricle,

00:19:02.717 --> 00:19:06.648
ventricle contracts,
both the doors are closed,

00:19:06.648 --> 00:19:09.759
the valves are closed,
pressure gets higher.

00:19:09.759 --> 00:19:14.898
Then, eventually the aortic
valve opens, and you get this

00:19:14.898 --> 00:19:20.037
event called ventricular
ejection where a volume of blood

00:19:20.037 --> 00:19:24.349
bursts out of the ventricle into
the aorta.

00:19:24.349 --> 00:19:28.000
The aortic valve closes again
and the cycle repeats itself.

00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:37.209
This is a schematic diagram to
show you sort of the sequence of

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:41.703
events, contraction and valve
activity that lead to the

00:19:41.703 --> 00:19:45.987
forward surge of blood.
The amount of blood that is

00:19:45.987 --> 00:19:50.365
ejected from the left ventricle
on each cycle is called the

00:19:50.365 --> 00:19:54.211
ejection volume.
If you took the ejection volume

00:19:54.211 --> 00:19:59.190
and multiplied it by the heart
rate you get the cardiac output.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:06.035
The ejection volume or the
volume of blood that's ejected

00:20:06.035 --> 00:20:13.224
from the ventricle on each beat
times the heart rate is equal to

00:20:13.224 --> 00:20:17.559
the cardiac output (EV * HR =
CO).

00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:22.549
You know this is
five--approximately at rest,

00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:25.696
5L/min.
If you assume that your cardiac

00:20:25.696 --> 00:20:29.743
output while you're sitting
there is 5L/min and you put your

00:20:29.743 --> 00:20:33.309
finger on your pulse and measure
your heart rate,

00:20:33.309 --> 00:20:36.468
then you could calculate
approximately how much blood is

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:39.340
being ejected from the ventricle
with each beat.

00:20:46.049 --> 00:20:49.071
Let's think about that same
kind of thing in more detail

00:20:49.071 --> 00:20:52.092
where we really track the
pressures because it turns out

00:20:52.092 --> 00:20:55.553
that following the pressures and
thinking about what's happening

00:20:55.553 --> 00:20:58.794
in the chambers and the valves
you can get a fairly complete

00:20:58.794 --> 00:21:02.200
picture of the physics of how
cardiac ejection occurs.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.123
This diagram is--it's in
the Power Points and--but it's a

00:21:07.123 --> 00:21:11.882
little hard to see I think on
the projection so I redrew it

00:21:11.882 --> 00:21:16.804
down here in color.
What it shows is pressure from

00:21:16.804 --> 00:21:22.569
0 to 120 as a function of time
during the cardiac cycle.

00:21:22.569 --> 00:21:27.482
I didn't write any time units
on here but this is time

00:21:27.482 --> 00:21:30.909
progressing.
This shows you two beats of the

00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:34.608
heart.
The most prominent thing that

00:21:34.608 --> 00:21:41.267
you notice is the green line
here which shows pressure in the

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:44.270
ventricle.
Which ventricle am I showing?

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.606
How would you tell?
I said they're both roughly the

00:21:53.606 --> 00:21:56.415
same, but how would you tell if
you this was the left or the

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:57.320
right ventricle?

00:22:05.819 --> 00:22:08.940
The total pressure,
and the pressure is high so

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:13.079
this must be the left ventricle
because it's reaching about 90

00:22:13.079 --> 00:22:14.922
mmHg,
the pressure you need to drive

00:22:14.922 --> 00:22:17.989
the systemic circulation.
This is indeed the left

00:22:17.989 --> 00:22:21.119
ventricle and it's the left
atrium.

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:24.302
You could have also noticed
this is the aorta I'm going to

00:22:24.302 --> 00:22:26.702
show you here,
so if I'm showing the unit it

00:22:26.702 --> 00:22:28.880
must be the left side of the
heart.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.019
The first thing you notice
is this big bump in pressure;

00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:34.359
this is the trace for the
ventricle.

00:22:34.359 --> 00:22:37.416
If I had a pressure sensor in
the ventricle and I was

00:22:37.416 --> 00:22:40.650
measuring how pressure changed
as a function of time,

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.259
I would measure what you see on
this green line here.

00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:49.744
Pressure starts off fairly low
and then goes up to 120 mmHg,

00:22:49.744 --> 00:22:54.141
and goes back down again,
up to 120 mmHg,

00:22:54.141 --> 00:22:57.107
down again.
This is the trace for the

00:22:57.107 --> 00:23:00.068
atrium on the bottom here.
You'll notice that the pressure

00:23:00.068 --> 00:23:03.096
in the atrium doesn't go through
these big excursions that the

00:23:03.096 --> 00:23:06.407
ventricle does.
That's because the atrium is

00:23:06.407 --> 00:23:10.270
not a powerful pump.
It's not a powerful muscle,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.522
and so it only generates a
little bit of pressure when it

00:23:14.522 --> 00:23:17.108
contracts.
The role of the atrium is to

00:23:17.108 --> 00:23:20.475
contract to basically fill up
the ventricle so that when the

00:23:20.475 --> 00:23:23.329
ventricle goes through its
massive contraction,

00:23:23.329 --> 00:23:26.869
it's as full of blood as it can
be.

00:23:26.869 --> 00:23:31.000
The atrium gives a little
beat in order to push whatever

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.519
blood is in it into the
ventricle.

00:23:33.519 --> 00:23:37.179
It doesn't have to go very far
so you don't need so much

00:23:37.179 --> 00:23:40.572
pressure, and fill up the
ventricle so that when the

00:23:40.572 --> 00:23:44.231
ventricle contracts you get as
much ejection of blood as

00:23:44.231 --> 00:23:47.230
possible,
the biggest volume ejected

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.928
possible.
If I looked at the difference

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:53.319
in pressures between the atrium
and the ventricle,

00:23:53.319 --> 00:23:57.287
at this point here,
and this point here where I'm

00:23:57.287 --> 00:24:01.831
starting is late in diastole,
remember what was happening

00:24:01.831 --> 00:24:06.380
late in diastole was that blood
is flowing from the left atrium

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.490
into the left ventricle and the
mitral valve is open.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.547
That's what you see here,
the pressure is slightly higher

00:24:13.547 --> 00:24:15.950
in the atrium than it is in the
ventricle.

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.901
If I looked at the pressure
drop at this point ΔP it's

00:24:19.901 --> 00:24:23.988
higher in the atrium than it is
in the ventricle and blood is

00:24:23.988 --> 00:24:29.882
naturally flowing that way.
That only happens if the mitral

00:24:29.882 --> 00:24:34.640
valve is open and it is at this
point;

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.450
the mitral valve is open during
diastole.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.035
The atrium contracts,
you see the little bump of

00:24:42.035 --> 00:24:45.902
pressure created by the atrium
contraction, and then the

00:24:45.902 --> 00:24:49.905
ventricle contracts.
This is the start of systole

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:54.289
right here, where the
contraction of the atrium starts

00:24:54.289 --> 00:24:57.350
is the beginning of the
heartbeat.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.712
What happens?
The atrium contracts,

00:24:59.712 --> 00:25:02.509
pressure stays higher in atrium
than it is in the ventricle.

00:25:02.509 --> 00:25:05.881
So, blood is flowing from the
atrium into the ventricle,

00:25:05.881 --> 00:25:09.559
and then all of a sudden the
ventricle starts contracting.

00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:12.389
The ventricle has a bigger
contraction, more muscle,

00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:14.720
so it's going to generate more
pressure.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.003
At some point very shortly
after it starts to contract,

00:25:19.003 --> 00:25:23.842
the pressure in the ventricle
becomes higher than the pressure

00:25:23.842 --> 00:25:26.890
in the atrium.
When the pressure in the

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:30.670
ventricle becomes higher than
the pressure in the atrium,

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:33.369
the valve between them,
the mitral valve,

00:25:33.369 --> 00:25:36.111
closes.
It closes strictly due to the

00:25:36.111 --> 00:25:40.173
fact--it closes for a number of
reasons but one of the reasons

00:25:40.173 --> 00:25:43.836
it closes is because there's
more pressure here now then

00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:46.900
there is here and it slams the
door shut.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.875
It's a one way valve;
when pressure becomes higher in

00:25:49.875 --> 00:25:53.220
the ventricle than the atrium,
the valve closes.

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.398
At this point here,
where the lines cross,

00:25:56.398 --> 00:25:58.870
this is the mitral valve
closing.

00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:11.410
What's happening at the
other--at the exit?

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:14.710
Well the aorta is this--the
pressure in the aorta is this

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.254
orange line here.
The pressure in the aorta is

00:26:17.254 --> 00:26:18.675
high.
Why is the pressure in the

00:26:18.675 --> 00:26:21.867
aorta high?
Because it was filled up with

00:26:21.867 --> 00:26:27.408
blood from the last heartbeat,
it was--this blood was ejected

00:26:27.408 --> 00:26:32.884
into the aorta at high pressure,
that pressure stays there from

00:26:32.884 --> 00:26:36.250
the last heartbeat.
Now, why does it do that?

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:41.319
Because the aortic valve is
closed;

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:48.529
during diastole the aortic
valve is closed.

00:26:48.529 --> 00:26:52.853
That means that the pressure
that was generated stays high in

00:26:52.853 --> 00:26:56.240
the aorta, even as the ventricle
is relaxing.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.137
The blood can't get sucked back
from the aorta into the

00:26:59.137 --> 00:27:02.410
ventricle because at this point
the aortic valve is closed.

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:18.420
When the mitral valve closes,
the aortic valve is already

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.680
closed, that means the ventricle
is sealed off.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.948
That's what I showed you in the
diagram here right after atrial

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:32.851
systole.
Both valves are closed and the

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:36.506
ventricle is contracting.
Because both valves are closed

00:27:36.506 --> 00:27:40.406
and the ventricle is contracting
we have the Luke Skywalker

00:27:40.406 --> 00:27:43.410
situation,
where pressure starts to rise

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.350
dramatically inside the closed
chamber.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:53.254
Eventually that pressure is
going to rise enough that the

00:27:53.254 --> 00:27:56.687
pressure in the ventricle
crosses over the pressure in the

00:27:56.687 --> 00:27:57.290
aorta.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:09.312
At this point what happens?
The aortic valve opens and

00:28:09.312 --> 00:28:18.990
blood can be ejected from the
ventricle into the aorta.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.665
Now, that's the only path for
the blood to go because the

00:28:22.665 --> 00:28:26.082
mitral valve is still closed.
The mitral valve is still

00:28:26.082 --> 00:28:29.234
closed because the pressure in
the ventricle is still much

00:28:29.234 --> 00:28:32.565
higher than it is in the atrium.
What this diagram shows you is

00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:35.622
a couple of different things.
It shows you pressure in each

00:28:35.622 --> 00:28:37.916
of the chambers,
think about the chamber,

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:40.210
the atrium, the ventricle,
the aorta.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:44.163
Depending on where one pressure
sits with respect to the other,

00:28:44.163 --> 00:28:47.352
if the pressure in the
ventricle is higher than the

00:28:47.352 --> 00:28:51.869
pressure in the aorta,
then the aortic valve is open.

00:28:51.869 --> 00:28:54.917
If it's the other way the
aortic valve is closed,

00:28:54.917 --> 00:28:58.410
and the same thing with the
ventricle and the atrium.

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:01.880
The aortic valve opens
here, contraction continues.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:05.181
This is the active phase of
ejection, which is shown in the

00:29:05.181 --> 00:29:07.230
diagram here,
mitral valve closed,

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.500
aortic valve open,
pressure high here,

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:13.108
pressure lower here.
So, blood is ejected from the

00:29:13.108 --> 00:29:16.533
heart, the muscle eventually
starts to relax,

00:29:16.533 --> 00:29:21.049
contraction is complete,
the ventricle starts relaxing.

00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:27.211
When the ventricular pressure
passes through this point and

00:29:27.211 --> 00:29:34.010
drops below the aortic pressure,
then the aortic valve closes.

00:29:39.059 --> 00:29:41.839
When the ventricular
pressure--the ventricle

00:29:41.839 --> 00:29:45.006
continues to relax,
eventually it falls even below

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:51.744
the pressure in the atrium,
and the mitral valve opens and

00:29:51.744 --> 00:30:00.740
the ventricle begins refilling
for the next contraction.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:08.214
Does this make sense?
This diagram--If you

00:30:08.214 --> 00:30:12.102
understand this diagram then you
understand the biophysics of

00:30:12.102 --> 00:30:15.730
pressure generation and flow
generation by the heart.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.516
It's a little bit hard to grasp
all at once, but if you walk

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:21.255
through it in the way that I
showed you then I think you'll

00:30:21.255 --> 00:30:24.749
begin to understand it.
Another way to understand it is

00:30:24.749 --> 00:30:28.658
to look at this diagram.
I've shown it a little bit more

00:30:28.658 --> 00:30:31.255
clearly here,
the mitral valve closing,

00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:34.126
aortic valve opening,
aortic valve closing,

00:30:34.126 --> 00:30:38.583
mitral valve reopening.
If you can follow the pressures

00:30:38.583 --> 00:30:43.341
and keep this diagram in mind,
why those valves open at the

00:30:43.341 --> 00:30:47.912
times they do makes sense.
The fact that they open in the

00:30:47.912 --> 00:30:52.516
sequence they do allow the heart
to undergo a cyclic contraction

00:30:52.516 --> 00:30:57.120
and relaxation which results in
a net forward flow of blood.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:06.331
This shows just where the
active contraction of systole

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:11.445
and diastole fall on this curve.
Systole begins when the atrium

00:31:11.445 --> 00:31:13.803
begins to contract,
atrium contracts,

00:31:13.803 --> 00:31:16.778
ventricle contracts,
systole ends here,

00:31:16.778 --> 00:31:21.430
and the ventricle starts to
relax at that point and that's

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:23.728
diastole.
Early diastole,

00:31:23.728 --> 00:31:27.682
the ventricle is still
relaxing, late diastole

00:31:27.682 --> 00:31:33.569
everything is fully relaxed and
prepared for the next heartbeat.

00:31:33.569 --> 00:31:35.250
What's the time of this whole
sequence?

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.360
Well, how fast--what's a heart
rate?

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:44.030
60 to 70 beats per minute;
so this whole sequence here

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:48.880
takes about a second.
Athletes, it's well known,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.060
training can decrease your
heart rate.

00:31:52.060 --> 00:32:00.689
What does that tell you?
Do athletes need less blood

00:32:00.689 --> 00:32:03.515
flow?
No, they need about the same

00:32:03.515 --> 00:32:06.859
blood flow but they have a
higher ejection volume.

00:32:06.859 --> 00:32:10.039
Their heart is operating very
efficiently;

00:32:10.039 --> 00:32:14.217
ejecting more volume per beat
and so they need less beats to

00:32:14.217 --> 00:32:16.200
supply the cardiac output.

00:32:21.069 --> 00:32:23.945
There are other changes
that occur during training as

00:32:23.945 --> 00:32:26.871
well, that's not the only thing,
but that's one thing that

00:32:26.871 --> 00:32:29.156
certainly occurs.
As you become more

00:32:29.156 --> 00:32:32.843
cardiovascular--as your
cardiovascular fitness increases

00:32:32.843 --> 00:32:36.329
you can--what happens when you
start to exercise?

00:32:36.329 --> 00:32:38.069
Two things happen when you
start to exercise.

00:32:38.069 --> 00:32:41.775
One is your heart rate goes up,
the second is your heart starts

00:32:41.775 --> 00:32:45.954
beating with more force,
so both the heart rate and the

00:32:45.954 --> 00:32:51.380
ejection volume go up in order
to create more cardiac output.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:55.415
A conditioned athlete will be
able to do both of those very

00:32:55.415 --> 00:32:57.898
efficiently.
They can create a higher

00:32:57.898 --> 00:33:00.789
cardiac output with less work
from the heart.

00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:03.644
That's why with conditioning
and training,

00:33:03.644 --> 00:33:07.681
you can start to be more--your
performance will be enhanced

00:33:07.681 --> 00:33:11.650
even though your heart rate
might not go up as someone who

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.460
is out of condition.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.750
This is just another
picture of the cardiac cycle

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:24.240
where now I've sort of combined
everything together.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:28.474
You can see this pressure curve
here, the pressure curve for the

00:33:28.474 --> 00:33:31.495
aorta, for the ventricle,
for the atrium,

00:33:31.495 --> 00:33:36.235
and you can visually correlate
that with what's happening in

00:33:36.235 --> 00:33:38.291
each event.
Late diastole,

00:33:38.291 --> 00:33:42.417
all the muscles are relaxed and
blood is passively flowing back

00:33:42.417 --> 00:33:46.543
into the left atrium and through
the mitral valve which is open

00:33:46.543 --> 00:33:50.695
to the left ventricle.
When contraction begins,

00:33:50.695 --> 00:33:55.014
first in the atrium,
blood is pumped into the

00:33:55.014 --> 00:33:58.572
ventricle.
The role of atrial contraction

00:33:58.572 --> 00:34:02.910
is roughly to fill up the
ventricle as much as possible.

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:06.784
When the ventricle starts to
contract, pressure in the

00:34:06.784 --> 00:34:10.001
ventricle rises above pressure
in the atrium,

00:34:10.001 --> 00:34:12.780
causing the mitral valve to
close.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:15.259
The aortic valve is already
closed, so now you have a closed

00:34:15.259 --> 00:34:18.040
chamber here.
This contraction is an

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.755
isovolumetric contraction,
fixed volume of blood trying to

00:34:22.755 --> 00:34:28.050
increase--the heart is working
to try to decrease the volume,

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:30.300
it can't, so the pressure goes
up.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.565
When the pressure goes up above
what it is in the aorta,

00:34:33.565 --> 00:34:36.897
the aortic valve opens,
blood is ejected,

00:34:36.897 --> 00:34:43.090
the muscle starts to relax,
and the aortic valve closes.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.472
Now this is key;
if your aortic valve didn't

00:34:45.472 --> 00:34:47.030
close what would happen here?

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.681
You'd pull in that blood that
you just ejected into the aorta,

00:34:53.681 --> 00:34:55.989
you'd pull it back into the
ventricle.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.841
A little bit does come back
because the valve doesn't close

00:34:58.841 --> 00:35:02.825
immediately;
a little bit does come back but

00:35:02.825 --> 00:35:06.171
not very much.
When physicians are

00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:10.891
listening to your heart one of
the things they're listening for

00:35:10.891 --> 00:35:15.840
is sounds that aren't normally
present in a functioning heart.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.901
Those sounds often have to do
with valves that are not

00:35:18.901 --> 00:35:22.193
functioning properly.
If during late systole,

00:35:22.193 --> 00:35:26.804
right after systole is over,
if they hear a 'whoosh' of

00:35:26.804 --> 00:35:30.624
blood when they shouldn't,
that might be because your

00:35:30.624 --> 00:35:33.778
aortic valve isn't functioning
properly and blood is whooshing

00:35:33.778 --> 00:35:36.260
back into the ventricle when it
shouldn't be.

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:42.233
Same thing with the mitral
valve, if they hear a noise at

00:35:42.233 --> 00:35:47.918
this point in the cardiac cycle,
that might be a flow of blood

00:35:47.918 --> 00:35:52.107
back from the ventricle into the
atrium when it shouldn't be

00:35:52.107 --> 00:35:54.425
happening,
that might be because your

00:35:54.425 --> 00:35:56.679
mitral valve is not functioning
properly.

00:35:56.679 --> 00:36:01.283
That's what physicians are
listening for when they listen

00:36:01.283 --> 00:36:04.489
to your chest during a physical
exam.

00:36:04.489 --> 00:36:07.238
Wilma?Student: What
causes the pressure in the left

00:36:07.238 --> 00:36:09.446
atrium to rise a little bit
after the mitral valve

00:36:09.446 --> 00:36:11.789
closes?Professor Mark
Saltzman: Here?

00:36:11.789 --> 00:36:15.438
So, what causes this little
blip of pressure here after the

00:36:15.438 --> 00:36:17.640
mitral valve closes do you
think?

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.431
Well, it probably happens just
because you're getting this

00:36:24.431 --> 00:36:27.244
massive contraction in the
ventricle that's right

00:36:27.244 --> 00:36:30.099
underneath it.
There's some change in volume

00:36:30.099 --> 00:36:33.575
here as well even though the
atrial contraction is almost

00:36:33.575 --> 00:36:36.379
complete.
Tou're also getting sort of a

00:36:36.379 --> 00:36:40.783
bystander effect from this very
large contraction down here and

00:36:40.783 --> 00:36:44.761
so that is--follows very closely
the pressure rise in the

00:36:44.761 --> 00:36:48.100
ventricle and is just a
byproduct of that.

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.530
Other questions?

00:36:58.889 --> 00:37:01.425
What I want to talk
about--so that's the end of the

00:37:01.425 --> 00:37:04.149
material that's covered on your
mid-term exam which is next

00:37:04.149 --> 00:37:07.142
Thursday.
What I want to talk about next

00:37:07.142 --> 00:37:11.510
week is--on Tuesday--is the
cardiac conduction system.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:17.490
I think you can see now that
for this orderly sequence of

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:23.150
events to occur it has to be
regulated in some way.

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:27.138
The proper function of your
heart requires all these things

00:37:27.138 --> 00:37:29.820
to occur in a very specific
sequence.

00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:35.504
The atrium has to contract
before the ventricle and in

00:37:35.504 --> 00:37:40.545
order for this logical
progression of pressures,

00:37:40.545 --> 00:37:45.050
proper functioning of the
valves, etc.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:48.158
Well, it's the cardiac
conduction system or this

00:37:48.158 --> 00:37:51.814
specialized system that moves
electrical impulses through the

00:37:51.814 --> 00:37:55.532
heart that is responsible for
coordinating the function of the

00:37:55.532 --> 00:37:59.664
heart on the heartbeat.
The cardiac conduction system

00:37:59.664 --> 00:38:04.639
is an electrical system where
impulses are carried through the

00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:09.756
substance of the heart.
Now, heart tissue is muscular

00:38:09.756 --> 00:38:14.510
tissue, it's also electrically
active tissue.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.991
Each of the cells are capable
of undergoing an action

00:38:17.991 --> 00:38:21.340
potential just like action
potentials in nerves.

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:25.299
The action potential in a
muscle cell is not strictly

00:38:25.299 --> 00:38:29.030
informational like it is in the
nervous system.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.633
An action potential was the way
that an electrical signal got

00:38:31.633 --> 00:38:33.889
propagated from one end of the
nerve to the other.

00:38:33.889 --> 00:38:37.350
In muscle cells electrical
signals get propagated from one

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:40.300
muscle cell to another,
but another thing happens.

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.129
This electrical signal also
activates the contraction

00:38:44.129 --> 00:38:47.929
mechanism inside cells.
As they're passing the

00:38:47.929 --> 00:38:53.630
electrical signal they're also
getting the message to contract.

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.755
Electrical activity in muscle
cells is linked to contraction

00:38:57.755 --> 00:39:01.601
and so as this electrical
activity passes over the heart

00:39:01.601 --> 00:39:04.807
in an orderly fashion,
because of the cardiac

00:39:04.807 --> 00:39:07.583
conduction system,
as it passes in an orderly

00:39:07.583 --> 00:39:10.170
fashion over the surface of the
heart,

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:13.907
as you'll see next time,
I'm showing it this way,

00:39:13.907 --> 00:39:18.658
this is the way the electrical
signal passes from right atrium

00:39:18.658 --> 00:39:22.896
down through left ventricle.
As it passes in that orderly

00:39:22.896 --> 00:39:26.701
way the muscles are activated to
contract in an orderly way as

00:39:26.701 --> 00:39:29.069
well,
I'd like you to review for next

00:39:29.069 --> 00:39:32.628
time what we talked about in
terms of action potentials that

00:39:32.628 --> 00:39:36.367
are in Chapter 6 because we're
going to talk about those in the

00:39:36.367 --> 00:39:38.660
context of a heart for next
time.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:44.429
Questions?
I'll see you this

00:39:44.429 --> 00:39:45.429
afternoon.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.215
Professor David
Blight:

00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:15.284
Good morning.
I'm going to talk today about

00:00:15.284 --> 00:00:18.067
turning points,
and on Thursday about turning

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:21.800
points, and beyond that,
probably, about turning points.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.536
But let me lay out right now my
own sort of selective list,

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:30.946
short list, of the most
important turning points in the

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:34.355
Civil War;
make the list and then we will

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:35.790
come back to them.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.852
Now this is any military
historian's, or any Civil War

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:46.200
historian's guess,
of course.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.115
But there's no question that
the Antietam campaign of 1862 is

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:55.949
a major turning point in the
Civil War, and I'll select that

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.315
as my first.
There are things happening

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:03.901
before that that are terribly
important, like the saving of

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:07.610
Richmond,
against McClelland's Peninsula

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.739
Campaign in June and July of
'62.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:14.053
But it is this first invasion
of the North by Robert E.

00:01:14.053 --> 00:01:17.121
Lee, culminating in the
bloodiest single day of the

00:01:17.121 --> 00:01:19.387
Civil War;
over 5000 dead,

00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:24.736
23,000 casualties in eight
hours, on fields along a little

00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:30.553
creek in southwestern Maryland
that not only stopped this first

00:01:30.553 --> 00:01:36.277
major invasion of the North and
this threat of a southern army

00:01:36.277 --> 00:01:39.867
to northern soil,
northern resources,

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:43.245
and northern cities,
but it of course resulted in

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:45.989
Lincoln's Emancipation
Proclamation,

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:50.880
which transformed the purpose
of the war on both sides;

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.921
back to that in a second.
The second major turning point

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:58.739
in the war, militarily,
I'd argue, as most people do,

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:04.022
was the Battle of Gettysburg in
July of 1863 and the day after

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:07.400
the three days' battle at
Gettysburg.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.310
The bloodiest encounter of the
entire war, if you add up the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.971
three days' casualties of almost
56,000 dead and wounded,

00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:21.799
in three days--that battle,
of course, stopped Lee's second

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.677
invasion of the North,
and we'll come to that in a

00:02:25.677 --> 00:02:30.461
moment, at least in brief terms.
On the day after Pickett's

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:35.910
Charge at Gettysburg on the
4^(th) of July 1863,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.216
the kind of citadel river town
or city of Vicksburg,

00:02:43.216 --> 00:02:48.229
Mississippi fell to Union
forces,

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.099
after a siege of nearly six
months.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.084
When Grant took Vicksburg on
the 4^(th) of July in 1863,

00:02:56.084 --> 00:03:00.888
it virtually opened up the
entire Mississippi River to

00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:05.161
Union control;
it cut geographically the

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:09.174
Confederacy in half;
it isolated Arkansas,

00:03:09.174 --> 00:03:13.789
Louisiana and Texas from the
rest of the Confederacy.

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:18.587
It was without a question,
at least in the long-term,

00:03:18.587 --> 00:03:23.199
a decisive turning point in the
war in the West.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:28.892
A third major turning point,
I'd argue, is the Fall of

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:34.818
Atlanta in September 1864;
and we'll come that later on,

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:39.226
after the break.
A fourth major turning point in

00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:43.750
the war, politically,
without any question I think,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.506
is the Election of 1864,
the only time in modern history

00:03:48.506 --> 00:03:53.522
that a republic attempted to
hold a general election in the

00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:57.759
midst of civil war and succeeded
in doing it.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:02.745
The re-election of Lincoln in
1864 was absolutely crucial to

00:04:02.745 --> 00:04:06.210
the prosecution of the war to
the ends,

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.832
the Lincoln administration at
least, by then,

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:13.637
had determined to fight it.
But without the fall of

00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:16.165
Atlanta, the first week of
September 1864,

00:04:16.165 --> 00:04:19.493
it's not at all clear Lincoln
would've been re-elected,

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:22.580
and more on that later.
And then fifth,

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.301
you could argue,
I would argue,

00:04:25.301 --> 00:04:30.199
the greatest single turning
point in the Civil War,

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:36.484
deeply related to these
military battlefront affairs,

00:04:36.484 --> 00:04:40.912
is emancipation.
The emancipation of 4.2 million

00:04:40.912 --> 00:04:44.690
American slaves in the midst of
eventually all-out,

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.536
near total war by the North on
the South, to destroy southern

00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:55.429
society and its institutions,
transformed American history,

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:59.519
more than just transforming a
war.

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:03.738
That's the theme of this
lecture and Thursday's lecture,

00:05:03.738 --> 00:05:08.871
and even to some extent beyond.
It is those results beyond the

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:14.420
battlefield that ultimately it
is our obligation to understand.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.208
It's important,
it's an obligation to

00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:22.009
understand why the Battle of
Antietam turned the way it did,

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.957
and it's an obligation to
understand why Lee is invading

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:28.367
the North a second time in 1863,
and why that encounter at

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:30.779
Gettysburg turned out the way it
did.

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.108
But by then it is a war being
fought for something very

00:05:35.108 --> 00:05:39.197
different, and much,
much larger than it had been at

00:05:39.197 --> 00:05:43.063
the outset.
One way into this story is a

00:05:43.063 --> 00:05:48.486
very simple quotation in one of
those interviews held with

00:05:48.486 --> 00:05:54.670
former slaves in the WPA Oral
History Narratives in the 1930s.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.938
These were the interviews,
over 3000 of them done with

00:05:57.938 --> 00:06:01.638
ex-slaves, many of them in their
eighties, some even in their

00:06:01.638 --> 00:06:06.276
nineties.
A guy named Cornelius Garner

00:06:06.276 --> 00:06:11.209
was interviewed in 1937,
at age 91.

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:15.256
He was asked if he had fought
in the Civil War,

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:19.040
and Cornelius replied to his
interviewer,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.730
who was a black interviewer in
this case, "Did I fight in the

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.718
War?
Well if I hadn't you wouldn't

00:06:27.718 --> 00:06:32.449
be sittin' there writin' at me
today."

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:36.680
He then went on to describe a
corner of his native Norfolk,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.765
Virginia where slave auctions
used to be conducted on New

00:06:40.765 --> 00:06:43.743
Year's Day.
"That day, New Year's Day,"

00:06:43.743 --> 00:06:47.580
said Garner, should be kept by
all the colored people.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.490
That is the day of freedom.
And they ought to remember

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.423
Frederick Douglass too.
Frederick Douglass told Abe

00:06:56.423 --> 00:07:00.170
Lincoln, 'Give the black man
guns and let him fight.'

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.500
And Abe Lincoln say,
'If I give him a gun,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.620
when it come to battle he might
run.'

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.268
And Frederick Douglass say,
'Try him, and you'll win the

00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:15.385
war.'
And Abe said,

00:07:15.385 --> 00:07:18.670
'All right, I'll try him.'"

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:28.786
Now that's a simplistic,
homespun explanation for how

00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:33.286
emancipation came about.
Over 180,000 African-Americans

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:39.136
will end up in the Union armies.
But old Cornelius wasn't

00:07:39.136 --> 00:07:45.437
entirely wrong.
All right, back to Virginia,

00:07:45.437 --> 00:07:46.510
in 1862.

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:54.790
I'll put the outline back up if
we need it.

00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:08.076
I don't know if you can see all
of that but I hope you can see

00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:11.360
some of it.
I left you with McClellan's

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.370
army on the peninsula having
been defeated.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.211
I thought I'd show you a couple
of magnificent Mathew Brady

00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:22.053
photographs.
Photography,

00:08:22.053 --> 00:08:24.410
of course, had finally come
into its own.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.354
The Civil War would be the
first major event in world

00:08:27.354 --> 00:08:29.959
history to be photographed on a
large scale,

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:32.202
and it's in part what made Ken
Burns's film possible,

00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:34.618
especially the use of that
camera they now that have that

00:08:34.618 --> 00:08:36.429
can go into an old daguerreotype
type,

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.805
which isn't any bigger than
this, and make it seem like a

00:08:39.805 --> 00:08:40.830
giant panorama.

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:50.660
This is a photograph taken
behind Union troops overlooking

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.639
the Cumberland River in May
1862;

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:59.342
that's before the Battle of the
Seven Days, that's during the

00:08:59.342 --> 00:09:02.870
march by McClellan's army up the
peninsula.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:08.268
I don't how well you can see
that but that's an absolutely

00:09:08.268 --> 00:09:13.666
stunning photograph of a Union
wagon train on one of these

00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:17.774
makeshift bridges.
They would build these things

00:09:17.774 --> 00:09:20.358
in a few hours,
over all these rivers,

00:09:20.358 --> 00:09:23.779
which in May of 1862 were
flooding constantly.

00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:31.159
It's Union troops crossing the
Chickahominy River,

00:09:31.159 --> 00:09:36.279
just east of Richmond,
May 1862.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:40.094
Now, what happened next of
course was--and this is where I

00:09:40.094 --> 00:09:43.841
left you--was Lee's fateful
decision to not stay and just

00:09:43.841 --> 00:09:47.042
defend Richmond;
so not just leave the war in

00:09:47.042 --> 00:09:50.057
Central Virginia.
Having defeated or held back

00:09:50.057 --> 00:09:52.977
McClellan's army,
and with a certain degree of

00:09:52.977 --> 00:09:56.611
confidence that McClellan
probably would be McClellan and

00:09:56.611 --> 00:10:00.120
not move,
he decided to invade the North.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.444
Now there were all these
high-level councils of war in

00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:07.019
Richmond between Jefferson
Davis, Lee and his generals.

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:10.059
There were arguments for and
against it.

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:12.991
But Lee won the day,
and the argument,

00:10:12.991 --> 00:10:17.667
and he went west behind the
Blue Ridge mountains and invaded

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:22.580
the North through the upper part
of the Shenandoah Valley,

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:26.479
the goal of which was to not
attack Washington,

00:10:26.479 --> 00:10:31.480
D.C., by any means--I think I
have a better map possibly;

00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:40.902
yes, maybe that helps a little
better--not to attack Washington

00:10:40.902 --> 00:10:45.059
or necessarily to even threaten
Philadelphia directly.

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:48.200
Lee had no intention of taking
over any northern cities.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.509
He couldn't do that.
He didn't have the resources.

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:51.270
He didn't have an army big
enough.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:56.394
How would he have occupied them?
But what he most wanted to do,

00:10:56.394 --> 00:10:58.978
the aim of this invasion,
was wanting to take the war out

00:10:58.978 --> 00:11:02.962
of ravaged Virginia;
to threaten northern cities,

00:11:02.962 --> 00:11:05.990
especially the U.S.
capital;

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.982
to try to bring about--and
Great Britain was on the brink

00:11:09.982 --> 00:11:14.260
of this, and I'll come back to
that foreign policy diplomatic

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.396
story a bit later--but Great
Britain was truly on the brink

00:11:18.396 --> 00:11:21.356
of near recognition,
at least a kind of

00:11:21.356 --> 00:11:24.797
quasi-recognition of the
Confederacy, and the theory here

00:11:24.797 --> 00:11:27.931
was that if the Confederate
forces could win a major

00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:30.840
victory,
somewhere on northern soil,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.888
get into Pennsylvania,
do it twice over,

00:11:33.888 --> 00:11:37.554
live off the land,
possibly even force the

00:11:37.554 --> 00:11:41.973
evacuation of the U.S.
capital, that news of that in

00:11:41.973 --> 00:11:46.678
Great Britain might bring about
British recognition of the

00:11:46.678 --> 00:11:50.309
Confederacy as the legitimate
government,

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:56.148
and especially give the
Confederacy access to its navy,

00:11:56.148 --> 00:12:01.230
if not even the possibility of
ground forces.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:05.970
And by the way,
a British force had already

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:12.177
been sent to Canada in early
1862 for the possibility of

00:12:12.177 --> 00:12:17.029
intervention in the American
Civil War.

00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:18.928
Now, there was also a theory
here at work that is going to be

00:12:18.928 --> 00:12:20.087
dead wrong.
Lee believed,

00:12:20.087 --> 00:12:22.962
as did other Confederate
leaders, that in Maryland,

00:12:22.962 --> 00:12:25.684
in particular,
there was a great deal of

00:12:25.684 --> 00:12:29.383
Confederate sympathy and
sentiment, and a lot of young

00:12:29.383 --> 00:12:31.453
Maryland men,
the theory was,

00:12:31.453 --> 00:12:35.141
eager to join the Confederate
forces if they could just get

00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:38.037
out of Maryland.
And that marching Confederate

00:12:38.037 --> 00:12:42.759
Army was going to attract them;
at least that was the theory.

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:49.990
The problem was when young men
actually saw that Confederate

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:55.123
Army, they were appalled,
because that Confederate Army

00:12:55.123 --> 00:12:59.022
that invaded across the Potomac
River--they crossed the Potomac

00:12:59.022 --> 00:13:03.534
on September 4 and September 5,
1862--was an army that had

00:13:03.534 --> 00:13:08.010
apparently remarkable,
almost miraculous morale;

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:12.103
they were winners.
They had just defeated a Union

00:13:12.103 --> 00:13:15.608
Army with McClellan's whole
force still back on the

00:13:15.608 --> 00:13:18.576
peninsula.
The 40 to 50,000 Union troops

00:13:18.576 --> 00:13:21.909
still guarding Washington,
DC were decisively,

00:13:21.909 --> 00:13:25.603
horribly defeated in the Battle
of Second Manassas,

00:13:25.603 --> 00:13:30.210
the last two days of August,
the 29^(th) and 30^(th) of 1862.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.734
That Union Army retreated once
again--fought on the same fields

00:13:34.734 --> 00:13:37.142
as First Bull Run,
thirteen months

00:13:37.142 --> 00:13:40.279
earlier--retreated into
Washington, DC.

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:44.134
Washington, DC,
on September 1^(st) 1862,

00:13:44.134 --> 00:13:47.409
was like a giant field
hospital.

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:50.689
There were some 3 to 4,000
wounded Union soldiers all over

00:13:50.689 --> 00:13:53.314
the streets of Washington,
a broken army,

00:13:53.314 --> 00:13:56.720
with McClellan's army now
retreating back up the

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:01.212
Chesapeake and the Potomac and
this huge flotilla trying to get

00:14:01.212 --> 00:14:05.559
to Washington in case Lee
actually attacked Washington.

00:14:05.559 --> 00:14:10.847
But the army Lee had was
starving, they weren't very well

00:14:10.847 --> 00:14:14.529
fed, and they weren't very well
clad.

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:18.714
Here's one description of a
young Marylander who saw the

00:14:18.714 --> 00:14:22.320
Confederate Army.
He said it was nothing but,

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.374
quote, "a set of ragamuffins.
It seemed as if every cornfield

00:14:27.374 --> 00:14:31.400
in Maryland had been robbed of
its scarecrows.

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:36.376
None had any underclothing.
My costume consisted of a

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:40.130
ragged pair of trousers,"--this
guy apparently joined--"a

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.290
stained dirty jacket,
an old slouch hat,

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:48.027
the brim pinned up with a
thorn, a begrimed blanket over

00:14:48.027 --> 00:14:50.746
my shoulder,
a grease-smeared cotton

00:14:50.746 --> 00:14:54.469
haversack full of apples and
corn, a cartridge box full and a

00:14:54.469 --> 00:14:56.750
musket.
I was barefooted.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.429
I had a stone bruise on each
foot.

00:14:59.429 --> 00:15:04.347
There was no one there who
would not have been run in by

00:15:04.347 --> 00:15:09.889
the police had he appeared on
the streets of a normal city."

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:12.824
And there's plenty of testimony
in the record,

00:15:12.824 --> 00:15:16.607
though a lot of young Maryland
men came out to see this now

00:15:16.607 --> 00:15:19.802
famous army of Robert E.
Lee, took one look or one

00:15:19.802 --> 00:15:23.519
smell, as one put it,
and went back to their farms.

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:28.230
Lee will get almost no real
recruits, out of Maryland.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:34.938
What they will do in Maryland,
however, is capture several

00:15:34.938 --> 00:15:40.116
hundred slaves and return them,
or take them,

00:15:40.116 --> 00:15:42.000
to Virginia.

00:15:45.009 --> 00:15:47.169
They're going to do the same
thing in 1863 in the Gettysburg

00:15:47.169 --> 00:15:48.450
campaign on an even larger
scale.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:56.049
Kidnapping was also part of the
Confederate army's job.

00:15:56.049 --> 00:16:01.902
Now, the battle would not have
occurred at Antietam except for

00:16:01.902 --> 00:16:05.740
the famous--and it's true--lost
order.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:09.269
Here's what happened.
Lee went into Maryland.

00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:11.870
The Union Army is all around
Washington, D.C.;

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.683
there's really no army up in
Maryland to stop him,

00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:18.376
yet.
He divided his army in three

00:16:18.376 --> 00:16:20.920
parts, three corps,
about 20,000,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.990
roughly, men each.
And they were spread out around

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:28.938
Maryland about twenty miles
apart, over a sixty-mile

00:16:28.938 --> 00:16:31.976
stretch.
Stonewall Jackson's corps was

00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:35.171
sent to Harpers Ferry.
The other two corps,

00:16:35.171 --> 00:16:38.605
they were separated,
at least by twenty miles in

00:16:38.605 --> 00:16:42.039
between them,
these three parts of his army.

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:46.355
One of the cardinal rules of
the old manuals they were taught

00:16:46.355 --> 00:16:49.740
in at West Point was,
quote, in the old,

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.642
in Henri Jomini's Military
Manual of Conduct,

00:16:54.642 --> 00:16:58.000
it said,
"never divide your forces in

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.320
the presence of the enemy."
It's exactly what Lee had done.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.689
The problem was that the Union
command was about to find out

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:10.709
quickly.
Lee wrapped orders around three

00:17:10.709 --> 00:17:14.974
cigars, sent his courier out to
the three corps commanders,

00:17:14.974 --> 00:17:19.460
over the course of more than a
day, to deliver the orders.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.160
But the orders were lost,
and they were found by a

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.861
private in an Indiana regiment
whose name was B.W.

00:17:26.861 --> 00:17:31.166
Mitchell-- the 27^(th) Indiana
Volunteers to be exact--who

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:34.490
picked up this bundle of three
cigars,

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.557
with paper wrapped around it,
and he read the orders,

00:17:37.557 --> 00:17:39.457
and at the bottom it said,
"R.

00:17:39.457 --> 00:17:41.937
E.
Lee." And he apparently said

00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:45.160
something like,
"I've heard of him."

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.141
And Lee was already a kind of
budding legend because of the

00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:53.920
Seven Days and because of Second
Manassas.

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:57.174
And he gave it to his colonel
who gave it to his

00:17:57.174 --> 00:18:01.190
brigadier-general who quickly
gave it to other generals.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:08.339
Lincoln had little choice but
to put McClellan back in charge.

00:18:08.339 --> 00:18:11.657
His commander at Second
Manassas had been a general

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:14.244
named John Pope,
who had been thoroughly

00:18:14.244 --> 00:18:17.230
defeated and had had a nervous
breakdown;

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.047
seriously, he had a mental
breakdown during the Second

00:18:21.047 --> 00:18:24.359
Manassas battle,
and Pope was out of action,

00:18:24.359 --> 00:18:27.884
to say the least,
and he would've been put out of

00:18:27.884 --> 00:18:30.965
action anyway.
So Lincoln puts McClellan back

00:18:30.965 --> 00:18:34.838
in command, in Washington D.C.,
and within hours McClellan was

00:18:34.838 --> 00:18:38.470
delivered Lee's orders,
just as though there had been a

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:44.146
fourth cigar for McClellan.
McClellan looked at these

00:18:44.146 --> 00:18:47.082
orders;
but they were discovered,

00:18:47.082 --> 00:18:50.400
by the way, on the 13^(th) of
September of 1862.

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.910
McClellan read them by that
night.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.851
The orders were basically to
have all parts of Lee's Army

00:18:57.851 --> 00:19:03.355
concentrate, rather slowly,
but concentrate toward the area

00:19:03.355 --> 00:19:07.440
of Sharpsburg,
Maryland, which is right here

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.922
along Antietam Creek.
Sharpsburg is a little town,

00:19:12.922 --> 00:19:17.239
Antietam's a little river.
But they were to congregate

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.380
there within the next,
oh, three to four days.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.509
McClellan now has at his
command about 90,000 troops.

00:19:24.509 --> 00:19:29.432
If he marched them quickly he
had the opportunity to defeat

00:19:29.432 --> 00:19:35.430
Lee's Army in parts.
But McClellan was McClellan.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:40.421
He sat on the lost order for
about two days before he decided

00:19:40.421 --> 00:19:44.829
(1) whether to believe it,
(2) what to do about it.

00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:48.507
Lee quickly discovered that his
orders never reached his

00:19:48.507 --> 00:19:51.761
commanders and he worried,
he sent out new orders to

00:19:51.761 --> 00:19:54.470
concentrate as fast as possible
near Sharpsburg.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:59.119
McClellan finally moved slowly
from the camps around

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:02.309
Washington, up toward
Sharpsburg.

00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:06.756
They encountered each other at
a place called South Mountain at

00:20:06.756 --> 00:20:10.630
the end of the day of the
15^(th) of September 1862,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.049
and a battle of a sort was
fought there.

00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:16.789
It was only a rearguard sort of
thing.

00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:19.956
Lee retreated out of the South
Mountain pass,

00:20:19.956 --> 00:20:23.267
down into this little valley
around Sharpsburg,

00:20:23.267 --> 00:20:27.009
Maryland, which is just above
the Potomac River.

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:30.181
Now Lee was taking a tremendous
risk here, because one of those

00:20:30.181 --> 00:20:33.200
other rules they'd been taught
was never engage an enemy,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:37.400
at least in full force,
with a major river behind you.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.900
But that's exactly what
happened.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.666
They fought the Battle of
Antietam on September 17,1862,

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:47.021
as I already said,
the bloodiest single day of the

00:20:47.021 --> 00:20:50.282
Civil War.
They fought in cornfields,

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:55.331
they fought across open fields,
they fought along a sunken

00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:57.619
road,
they fought along a famous

00:20:57.619 --> 00:21:00.109
bridge now known as the Burnside
Bridge.

00:21:00.109 --> 00:21:03.910
I have a couple of photographs
to show you.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:09.576
They fought along what's known
as the Hagerstown Road,

00:21:09.576 --> 00:21:15.778
along which 48 hours after the
battle one of Mathew Brady's

00:21:15.778 --> 00:21:20.589
photographers took this awful
photograph.

00:21:20.589 --> 00:21:24.730
These are Confederate dead
along that road.

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:28.510
There are many,
many photographs taken at

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:32.452
Antietam.
This is another one of Union

00:21:32.452 --> 00:21:37.738
dead lined up for burial,
a line of dead probably 75

00:21:37.738 --> 00:21:39.190
yards long.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:51.881
Antietam was in no way
necessarily a decisive or

00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:57.779
strategic victory for either
side.

00:21:57.779 --> 00:22:01.630
I want you to see this
photograph because of its irony.

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:03.390
You've probably seen this one
before.

00:22:07.039 --> 00:22:09.576
At the end of the day at
Antietam there were about 23,000

00:22:09.576 --> 00:22:11.569
casualties on both sides,
over 5,000 dead.

00:22:11.569 --> 00:22:16.149
And you may remember back on
9/11, in the immediate aftermath

00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:20.806
of 9/11, the estimates were over
5,000 dead at the World Trade

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:25.004
Center and people were comparing
this to Antietam as the

00:22:25.004 --> 00:22:29.049
bloodiest day of sacrifice in
American history.

00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:31.740
It turned out not to be the
case;

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:35.937
nevertheless.
What happened in the wake of

00:22:35.937 --> 00:22:41.349
Antietam was that Lee's invasion
of the North had been stopped.

00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:46.305
Now McClellan missed a
tremendous opportunity to press

00:22:46.305 --> 00:22:49.214
the day.
This has always been a debate

00:22:49.214 --> 00:22:52.141
among military historians,
and you can read,

00:22:52.141 --> 00:22:55.750
oh God, hundreds of pages on
this, if you care to.

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:00.706
It's always been a debate as to
whether if McClellan had

00:23:00.706 --> 00:23:05.932
followed this up could he have
literally crushed Lee's army

00:23:05.932 --> 00:23:11.430
with the Potomac at his back and
in effect ended the war?

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.622
There surely was that
possibility but the day at

00:23:14.622 --> 00:23:18.765
Antietam had been so devastating
to both forces that McClellan

00:23:18.765 --> 00:23:24.128
did not move;
in fact, he did not move for

00:23:24.128 --> 00:23:26.535
days.
It's also true though that

00:23:26.535 --> 00:23:30.009
McClellan kept in reserve at
Antietam, and it was this act,

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:34.804
I think, more than anything
else, that got Lincoln finally

00:23:34.804 --> 00:23:39.009
to go out there by October 3 and
fire McClellan.

00:23:39.009 --> 00:23:42.949
McClellan kept about 20,000 of
his troops in reserve at

00:23:42.949 --> 00:23:46.670
Antietam, always fearing that he
was outnumbered;

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:52.615
he didn't use them.
And in a military sense had

00:23:52.615 --> 00:23:57.256
someone like Grant been in
charge at Antietam,

00:23:57.256 --> 00:24:03.033
it is entirely possible Lee
would've been defeated and at

00:24:03.033 --> 00:24:09.890
least the war in the East ended.
But that was not the case.

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:14.930
Lee retreated back into
Virginia to fight again.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.436
This is a Mathew Brady
photograph, taken of Lincoln

00:24:18.436 --> 00:24:21.530
meeting with McClellan.
This is McClellan right here.

00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:27.447
There's also a famous photo of
them sitting in that same tent

00:24:27.447 --> 00:24:31.549
you may have seen;
Burns uses it in the series.

00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:36.297
It was in this meeting that
Lincoln went out to meet with

00:24:36.297 --> 00:24:41.379
McClellan to urge him to move,
to push into northern Virginia,

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:44.437
to push after Lee's Army in
early autumn,

00:24:44.437 --> 00:24:49.452
while the weather was so good.
And McClellan did not move,

00:24:49.452 --> 00:24:53.700
and a couple of days after that
he was fired;

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.870
and fired for good.

00:24:58.039 --> 00:25:00.809
Although McClellan will not
leave history of course,

00:25:00.809 --> 00:25:04.012
he will come back to be the
Democratic Party's candidate for

00:25:04.012 --> 00:25:06.509
president in 1864 against
Abraham Lincoln.

00:25:06.509 --> 00:25:10.853
Now it is, of course,
in the wake of Antietam that

00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:15.019
Lincoln issued his Emancipation
Proclamation.

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:26.179
Let me turn to that now and
explain why and how emancipation

00:25:26.179 --> 00:25:37.244
became the new cause of the war.
Now, let's discuss Lincoln for

00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:41.383
a moment, first.
The biggest problem with

00:25:41.383 --> 00:25:45.355
Abraham Lincoln has always been
not--that is in how we interpret

00:25:45.355 --> 00:25:48.067
him and treat him,
understand him,

00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:51.119
use him, which we do
constantly.

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:54.160
Every president,
every American politician,

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.563
as David Donald once said
famously in the 1950s,

00:25:57.563 --> 00:26:00.170
"has to get right with
Lincoln."

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.830
Everybody uses him.
We twist him all inside out and

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.849
make him say whatever we want
him to say.

00:26:05.849 --> 00:26:10.108
And there's no other American
in our history who has been

00:26:10.108 --> 00:26:14.367
given credit for more apocryphal
quotations, than Abraham

00:26:14.367 --> 00:26:16.943
Lincoln.
A little later in the course

00:26:16.943 --> 00:26:20.032
I'll use a few of them,
at the end of--when we get to

00:26:20.032 --> 00:26:23.477
the end of the war.
But the problem with Lincoln is

00:26:23.477 --> 00:26:26.923
indeed his ambiguity,
the reality of his historical

00:26:26.923 --> 00:26:29.830
ambiguity.
There is a puzzling dualism

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.048
about him.
There are two,

00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:36.244
at least two,
seeming incompatible legends,

00:26:36.244 --> 00:26:40.039
if you want,
about Abraham Lincoln.

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:43.566
One has him as the kind of
awkward, amiable,

00:26:43.566 --> 00:26:45.863
storytelling,
rail splitting,

00:26:45.863 --> 00:26:50.550
frontier folk hero,
everybody's favorite homespun,

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:55.779
granddaddy with a corncob pipe,
who might just tell you a

00:26:55.779 --> 00:27:00.400
little raunchy story,
and have you chuckling;

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.543
he's kind of fun.
The other though is the

00:27:06.543 --> 00:27:10.176
towering political genius,
the moral leader,

00:27:10.176 --> 00:27:14.908
the shaper of a nation's
destiny, savior of the Union and

00:27:14.908 --> 00:27:20.183
the Great Emancipator.
He never quite asked for any of

00:27:20.183 --> 00:27:24.009
those.
Everybody needs to claim him

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:26.781
though.
There's a brilliant essay on

00:27:26.781 --> 00:27:29.589
this by an historian named Scott
Sandage.

00:27:29.589 --> 00:27:32.211
It came out about ten years
ago, it's called "A Marble House

00:27:32.211 --> 00:27:34.187
Divided."
It's all about the Lincoln

00:27:34.187 --> 00:27:35.725
Memorial.
A lot of you you've probably

00:27:35.725 --> 00:27:38.470
been to the Lincoln Memorial.
It is America's secular temple.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:42.501
Everybody uses it.
The Ku Klux Klan has held

00:27:42.501 --> 00:27:46.443
rallies at Lincoln's temple.
Martin Luther King gave the

00:27:46.443 --> 00:27:48.789
Dream speech at Lincoln's
temple.

00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:53.710
It's been used by every extreme
of American political culture.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.025
If you want to claim the
nation's attention,

00:27:57.025 --> 00:28:00.341
go to the nation's temple and
claim old Abe,

00:28:00.341 --> 00:28:03.544
up behind you.
He was never very open about

00:28:03.544 --> 00:28:05.942
himself, never wrote an
autobiography,

00:28:05.942 --> 00:28:09.053
didn't write many
autobiographical sentences as a

00:28:09.053 --> 00:28:13.556
matter of fact;
didn't live long enough to do

00:28:13.556 --> 00:28:17.589
that.
He was never an abolitionist.

00:28:17.589 --> 00:28:20.985
He actually had a lot of
personal contempt for radical

00:28:20.985 --> 00:28:24.386
abolitionists.
He didn't like a lot of their

00:28:24.386 --> 00:28:29.220
arguments and he didn't like
their tactics and strategies.

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.405
He was a genius with language;
no, no, there's no question

00:28:32.405 --> 00:28:35.668
about that.
We've never had a president who

00:28:35.668 --> 00:28:39.382
could use words,
who could find the music of

00:28:39.382 --> 00:28:43.761
words, like Lincoln.
He wrote every word and every

00:28:43.761 --> 00:28:48.461
sentence of every one of his
speeches and every one of his

00:28:48.461 --> 00:28:52.512
great public letters.
Jim McPherson even went so far

00:28:52.512 --> 00:28:56.451
as to write an article saying
how Lincoln won the war with

00:28:56.451 --> 00:28:59.923
metaphors.
I don't know whether a metaphor

00:28:59.923 --> 00:29:03.798
can win you a war.
Strongest battalions might be a

00:29:03.798 --> 00:29:06.320
little more important in the
end.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.936
Who knows?
Is he the symbol,

00:29:11.936 --> 00:29:15.679
though, of the man who held
back emancipation as a white

00:29:15.679 --> 00:29:18.788
supremacist,
or is he the symbol of the man

00:29:18.788 --> 00:29:22.340
who outgrew his prejudices,
and those of his time,

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:26.630
to become the emancipator?
Or was he just a shrewd

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:30.741
politician, kind of finding the
middle ground and seeing how the

00:29:30.741 --> 00:29:34.395
wind was going to blow if he
tried this or if he threw up

00:29:34.395 --> 00:29:37.650
that balloon,
or if he tried that?

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:46.079
Now there are many ways to
reflect on Lincoln.

00:29:46.079 --> 00:29:49.592
My own favorite expression
about him--and there are

00:29:49.592 --> 00:29:53.527
thousands of these--but my own
favorite comes from W.E.B.

00:29:53.527 --> 00:29:57.461
DuBois, the great black scholar
of the twentieth century,

00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:01.255
who I think really captured all
sides of Lincoln in one

00:30:01.255 --> 00:30:03.364
quotation.
This was DuBois,

00:30:03.364 --> 00:30:06.265
in an editorial he wrote in
1922 in The Crisis

00:30:06.265 --> 00:30:08.808
magazine.
He wrote it at the time of the

00:30:08.808 --> 00:30:10.789
unveiling of the Lincoln
Memorial.

00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:15.441
He also wrote it at a time when
he was fed up with all of the

00:30:15.441 --> 00:30:18.929
national honoring and
celebration of Robert E.

00:30:18.929 --> 00:30:20.610
Lee.
So it may have--that

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.836
celebration of Lee,
which disgusted DuBois,

00:30:22.836 --> 00:30:25.539
maybe had had something to do
with how he wrote this

00:30:25.539 --> 00:30:30.357
expression about Lincoln.
But this is DuBois on Lincoln,

00:30:30.357 --> 00:30:35.307
quote: "I love him,
not because he was perfect,

00:30:35.307 --> 00:30:41.009
but because he was not perfect,
and yet triumphed.

00:30:41.009 --> 00:30:44.130
There was something left so
that at the crisis he was big

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:47.160
enough to be inconsistent,
cruel, merciful,

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.929
peace loving,
a fighter, despising negroes

00:30:50.929 --> 00:30:56.015
and letting them fight,
and vote, protecting slavery

00:30:56.015 --> 00:31:00.514
and freeing slaves.
He was a man,

00:31:00.514 --> 00:31:07.049
a big, inconsistent,
brave man."

00:31:07.049 --> 00:31:10.667
I'd argue, my friends,
that the most important thing

00:31:10.667 --> 00:31:14.427
you can grasp about Abraham
Lincoln is that he had the

00:31:14.427 --> 00:31:18.348
capacity for growth.
He was big enough to be

00:31:18.348 --> 00:31:22.109
inconsistent,
or as Emerson once put it,

00:31:22.109 --> 00:31:26.450
consistency's a hobgoblin of
simple minds.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:30.113
Remember all that language
about flip-flopping in the 2004

00:31:30.113 --> 00:31:32.130
election?
One of the candidates was

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.750
alleged to have been a
flip-flopper all the time.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.825
Well, if Abraham Lincoln hadn't
been a flip-flopper we wouldn't

00:31:37.825 --> 00:31:39.860
have had the Emancipation
Proclamation.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.471
So here's to flip-flopping.
[laughter]

00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:47.779
Lincoln's early record on
slavery is interesting.

00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:51.833
As early as 1837 he was one of
only two representatives in the

00:31:51.833 --> 00:31:55.687
Illinois Legislature to vote
against a resolution declaring

00:31:55.687 --> 00:31:59.963
the right of slave ownership;
he was twenty-eight years-old

00:31:59.963 --> 00:32:02.900
at that time.
He has one two-year term in the

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.733
House of Representatives.
During that term,

00:32:05.733 --> 00:32:09.586
which was the Mexican War,
he found himself appalled at

00:32:09.586 --> 00:32:12.940
the slave trade in the District
of Columbia.

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.184
You could go visit slave
auctions, as I've said before,

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:19.308
I think, two or three blocks
down the street from the

00:32:19.308 --> 00:32:21.891
capitol.
He called that slave market,

00:32:21.891 --> 00:32:25.879
quote, "a sort of Negro livery
stable where droves of Negroes

00:32:25.879 --> 00:32:28.589
are collected,
temporarily kept and finally

00:32:28.589 --> 00:32:31.409
taken to Southern markets,
precisely like droves of

00:32:31.409 --> 00:32:34.784
horses."
He also said during that same

00:32:34.784 --> 00:32:39.913
term, "If the Negro is a man,
why then my ancient faith

00:32:39.913 --> 00:32:45.516
teaches me that all men are
created equal and that there can

00:32:45.516 --> 00:32:51.500
be no moral right in connection
with one man's making a slave of

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.667
another."
At the same time Lincoln though

00:32:54.667 --> 00:32:58.440
was a Henry Clay Whig.
He was a supporter of the

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:02.624
Compromise of 1850.
He believed in compensation to

00:33:02.624 --> 00:33:06.412
slave owners as a way,
a hope, of setting up some kind

00:33:06.412 --> 00:33:09.999
of gradual emancipation plan.
And he believed,

00:33:09.999 --> 00:33:14.710
as Henry Clay had founded it,
in this idea--at least he did

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.039
for awhile--this idea of
colonization,

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:24.146
of sending blacks either to
Africa or to the Caribbean or to

00:33:24.146 --> 00:33:27.876
Central America.
I don't have time to stop on

00:33:27.876 --> 00:33:32.009
those fabulous Lincoln-Douglas
debates where you can find every

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:35.700
extreme of Abraham Lincoln.
I was once given an assignment

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:38.009
in a junior seminar as an
undergraduate.

00:33:38.009 --> 00:33:41.268
Old Fred Williams at Michigan
State sent us to the Lincoln

00:33:41.268 --> 00:33:44.754
Collected Papers and he said,
"Your assignment is to come

00:33:44.754 --> 00:33:47.991
back with one passage
demonstrating that Lincoln was

00:33:47.991 --> 00:33:51.737
anti-slavery and believed in
emancipation and come back with

00:33:51.737 --> 00:33:55.420
one passage showing that he was
a white supremacist."

00:33:55.420 --> 00:34:02.325
Now, growing up a Lincoln
lover, and I thought "oh,

00:34:02.325 --> 00:34:06.167
dear."
That's like you've been raised

00:34:06.167 --> 00:34:10.730
in a certain religion and
somebody says go read the

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:16.570
Bhagavad-Gita or read the Koran
or study Buddhism for awhile.

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:20.849
I did that too for awhile;
I didn't learn much but--.

00:34:20.849 --> 00:34:24.717
[Laughter]
And sure enough you can find

00:34:24.717 --> 00:34:30.010
all those extremes in the
Lincoln-Douglas debates.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.282
We also know,
of course, that he was a free

00:34:32.282 --> 00:34:34.610
soiler and he's most famous in
the South,

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.605
of course, for that language of
"putting slavery on a course of

00:34:37.605 --> 00:34:40.070
ultimate extinction" in the
House Divided speech,

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:44.668
and elsewhere.
But once the war came,

00:34:44.668 --> 00:34:50.512
the imperative about what to do
about slavery was a huge and

00:34:50.512 --> 00:34:54.869
delicate and terrible political
question.

00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:58.246
And this is the Lincoln that
will be forever debated and

00:34:58.246 --> 00:35:02.052
it'll be debated next year like
it's never been debated because

00:35:02.052 --> 00:35:05.059
it's the bicentennial of his
birth next year,

00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:07.881
and as I've warned you,
it will be raining Lincoln

00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:10.760
books and you will have to dodge
them next year.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.195
[Laughter]
Now, after the war broke out

00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:19.349
immediately some slaves began to
come into Union lines.

00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:24.364
The first were at a fort in
Florida, and then as early as

00:35:24.364 --> 00:35:29.289
May 1861, some slaves began to
come into Union lines,

00:35:29.289 --> 00:35:34.860
handfuls, near Fortress Monroe
in Virginia.

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.821
And there was a Union commander
there, a political general,

00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:41.074
a former Democrat,
before the war,

00:35:41.074 --> 00:35:43.260
and anything but an
abolitionist,

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.992
Benjamin F.
Butler, who nevertheless when

00:35:45.992 --> 00:35:49.679
these slaves came into his
lines, he realized,

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:52.664
no, wait a second,
the Confederates are over there

00:35:52.664 --> 00:35:55.769
using these people to build
their fortifications,

00:35:55.769 --> 00:36:00.110
maybe we could use them to
build our fortifications.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:05.989
So why don't we confiscate them
and call them contraband of war?

00:36:05.989 --> 00:36:13.010
They're property under the law,
call them contraband.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.346
And the name stuck,
of course, and that name will

00:36:15.346 --> 00:36:18.120
end up in poetry and in song,
and even in a law or two;

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:25.674
contraband property.
But, at the outset of the war,

00:36:25.674 --> 00:36:31.039
in the summer of '61,
fall, winter of '61/'62,

00:36:31.039 --> 00:36:34.175
into the spring of '62,
the first year of the war,

00:36:34.175 --> 00:36:37.695
the official policy of the
Lincoln administration and of

00:36:37.695 --> 00:36:40.492
the Union forces,
across the land,

00:36:40.492 --> 00:36:45.030
the official policy,
was called denial of asylum.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:49.032
It meant that any slave who
escaped into Union lines,

00:36:49.032 --> 00:36:53.111
the officer in charge and
command of that unit had the

00:36:53.111 --> 00:36:57.190
responsibility to return that
slave to his owner,

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:02.695
if the owner--this was the
impossible kicker--if the owner

00:37:02.695 --> 00:37:06.780
was loyal to the Union.
If that owner was not loyal to

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:09.900
the Union and was in the
Confederate army or something,

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.630
then yes, you could admit that
slave to your lines as

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:18.412
contraband of war.
Now, of course if this had only

00:37:18.412 --> 00:37:22.021
been a trickle of people here
and there, coming into Union

00:37:22.021 --> 00:37:24.680
lines, possibly this could be
enforced.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.521
But it wasn't enforceable.
How's that Union commander

00:37:29.521 --> 00:37:35.084
going to go out and figure out,
hey, mister enslaved person,

00:37:35.084 --> 00:37:39.610
is your owner loyal or disloyal
to the Union?

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:45.006
That slave is probably going to
say, "He's a Confederate,

00:37:45.006 --> 00:37:51.039
what do you think?"
And, of course, most were.

00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:55.665
Now, Congress took the lead
before Lincoln ever wrote an

00:37:55.665 --> 00:37:59.049
Emancipation Proclamation,
although Lincoln was thinking

00:37:59.049 --> 00:38:01.320
about this and working on this
all through that summer of 1862.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:07.928
Congress took the lead.
Now this was a Congress,

00:38:07.928 --> 00:38:10.110
remember, that is now dominated
by the Republican Party.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:14.039
You got eleven southern states
out of the Union.

00:38:14.039 --> 00:38:15.998
They don't have any senators,
they don't even have members in

00:38:15.998 --> 00:38:18.878
the House of Representatives.
This is a northern Republican

00:38:18.878 --> 00:38:23.133
majority, significant majority.
Now, they're going to run into

00:38:23.133 --> 00:38:27.010
trouble in the fall
congressional elections of 1862,

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:29.627
and they're going to lose some
of those seats because of what

00:38:29.627 --> 00:38:31.539
they're doing now.
Congress took the lead;

00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:36.124
it passed an Article of War in
March of 1862 which said that

00:38:36.124 --> 00:38:40.010
fugitive slaves must be admitted
to Union camps.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.626
It didn't say what their status
would be, it didn't define

00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:43.406
anybody.
It left their legal status

00:38:43.406 --> 00:38:46.140
vague.
It just said any escaped slave

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:49.741
must now be admitted.
Now, the reason they did that

00:38:49.741 --> 00:38:53.915
is because this denial of asylum
policy had caused chaos in a lot

00:38:53.915 --> 00:38:57.030
of Union units.
A brief example.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.751
Remember this guy Charles
Brewster whose letters I read

00:38:59.751 --> 00:39:02.655
from the other day;
this guy from Massachusetts

00:39:02.655 --> 00:39:04.980
whose letters I edited and so
on?

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.990
Well Charlie Brewster,
this racist from Northampton,

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.900
Massachusetts,
28-years-old by now,

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:18.225
nevertheless in the late fall
of 1861, he took a runaway slave

00:39:18.225 --> 00:39:22.269
who was 17-years-old and named
David,

00:39:22.269 --> 00:39:29.829
into his personal care--he made
him his personal servant.

00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:33.219
This is after Brewster got his
commission as an officer.

00:39:33.219 --> 00:39:35.876
He even wrote home to his
sister, several times,

00:39:35.876 --> 00:39:38.081
asking his sister to send
stocking caps,

00:39:38.081 --> 00:39:42.156
socks, an old pair of pants.
He even named the shirts that

00:39:42.156 --> 00:39:46.432
he wanted to put on his David;
it was as though he was

00:39:46.432 --> 00:39:50.965
dressing him.
And Brewster was determined

00:39:50.965 --> 00:39:56.010
never to send that kid back to
slavery.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.519
But down came the orders,
by January, early February

00:39:59.519 --> 00:40:03.374
1862, that all fugitive slaves
within their camps must be

00:40:03.374 --> 00:40:07.013
returned to their owners,
if those owners came to the

00:40:07.013 --> 00:40:12.039
Union lines to retrieve them.
And the fugitive named David

00:40:12.039 --> 00:40:16.039
had his owner waiting at the
camp.

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:17.711
There was a near mutiny in the
10^(th) Massachusetts,

00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:20.229
which was Brewster's regiment,
between those soldiers who

00:40:20.229 --> 00:40:23.380
wanted to protect these fugitive
slaves and free them,

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.340
in effect, and those who did
not.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.539
And this went on in hundreds of
regiments.

00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:32.400
Brewster was threatened with
court martial and being run out

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:36.130
of the Army if he didn't give
back this fugitive slave.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:40.813
His compromise was that he took
this young David out into the

00:40:40.813 --> 00:40:43.545
woods and he said,
"Get out of here,

00:40:43.545 --> 00:40:45.980
run.
I'll just tell them you ran

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:51.969
away."
And that's what he did.

00:40:51.969 --> 00:40:55.077
By that spring,
Congress decided any fugitive

00:40:55.077 --> 00:40:58.750
slave who escapes to Union lines
must be accepted.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.474
In April of 1862,
Congress, on the 16^(th) of

00:41:02.474 --> 00:41:07.045
April--and this was a very
significant law--they passed

00:41:07.045 --> 00:41:10.331
abolition,
the end of slavery in the

00:41:10.331 --> 00:41:15.377
District of Columbia.
They gave $300 per slave in

00:41:15.377 --> 00:41:22.010
compensation to those owners of
slaves in the district.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:26.420
The District of Columbia in
1862 had 3,100 slaves.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:31.604
They also put up,
I think the figure was about

00:41:31.604 --> 00:41:37.594
$300,000.00 in that bill,
where they provided for the

00:41:37.594 --> 00:41:44.852
possible colonization of blacks
voluntarily to foreign countries

00:41:44.852 --> 00:41:50.482
as a result of emancipation,
a policy the Lincoln

00:41:50.482 --> 00:41:53.480
administration now was
supporting.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:59.289
Then third, in June of '62,
Congress, by majority vote,

00:41:59.289 --> 00:42:05.421
sort of threw a great deal of
American history on the dust

00:42:05.421 --> 00:42:11.123
heap and they abolished slavery
forever in the Western

00:42:11.123 --> 00:42:14.413
Territories;
arguably the single most

00:42:14.413 --> 00:42:16.329
important cause of the Civil
War.

00:42:16.329 --> 00:42:18.892
A stroke of the pen,
in June of '62,

00:42:18.892 --> 00:42:22.188
they ended slavery,
in spite of the Dred Scott

00:42:22.188 --> 00:42:24.375
decision.
Now, remember what the Dred

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:28.382
Scott decision had said.
Here was Congress passing a law

00:42:28.382 --> 00:42:33.000
in direct opposition to a
Supreme Court decision.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.297
It's an argument for not having
too many civil wars,

00:42:36.297 --> 00:42:40.113
you see, because Congress might
end up doing anything in the

00:42:40.113 --> 00:42:46.039
midst of a civil war,
and they surely did here.

00:42:46.039 --> 00:42:49.159
And then finally,
on July 17,1862,

00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:55.019
Congress passed what was called
the Second Confiscation Act.

00:42:55.019 --> 00:42:58.057
There'd been a First
Confiscation Act passed back in

00:42:58.057 --> 00:43:00.885
August of '61.
Even in the First Confiscation

00:43:00.885 --> 00:43:03.822
Act--and by the way,
these were acts authorizing

00:43:03.822 --> 00:43:07.010
Union forces to confiscate
Confederate property.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:11.489
Even in the First Confiscation
Act, back in August of 1861,

00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:14.269
slaves were mentioned as
property;

00:43:14.269 --> 00:43:19.010
their status was still very
vague.

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.303
But in the Second Confiscation
Act, July '62,

00:43:22.303 --> 00:43:25.745
the law explicitly freed slaves
of all persons,

00:43:25.745 --> 00:43:28.440
quote, "in rebellion,"
anywhere;

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:33.230
any slave of anyone supporting
the Confederacy.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.961
It did everything the
Emancipation Proclamation will

00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:39.261
later do and then some.
It was in some ways more

00:43:39.261 --> 00:43:43.511
extensive because it included
all parts of the South,

00:43:43.511 --> 00:43:48.251
including those Border States
that had not seceded from the

00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:51.285
Union.
Now, with Congress already

00:43:51.285 --> 00:43:55.885
having done these things,
by July of '62--and by the way,

00:43:55.885 --> 00:43:59.252
this is all during the
Peninsula Campaign,

00:43:59.252 --> 00:44:03.154
down in Virginia.
The Second Confiscation Act was

00:44:03.154 --> 00:44:06.869
passed in the immediate wake of
the Seven Days battle.

00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:09.289
Lee is deciding to invade the
North.

00:44:09.289 --> 00:44:13.332
Lincoln, as you may know the
story--if you've read Team of

00:44:13.332 --> 00:44:17.509
Rivals by Doris Goodwin you
know it-- would hang out at the

00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:20.690
War Department.
He'd go there for some solitude.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.010
He had a private little office
there.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:26.564
He began to draft an
Emancipation Proclamation as a

00:44:26.564 --> 00:44:29.680
legal brief, a legal document,
and he kept it in a locked door

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:33.315
of a desk at the War Department.
Supposedly there was one or two

00:44:33.315 --> 00:44:37.269
guards that knew about it;
I'm not sure about that.

00:44:37.269 --> 00:44:41.465
But he was beginning to draft
an Emancipation Proclamation

00:44:41.465 --> 00:44:45.440
probably as early as June,
certainly by July of '62.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.670
The pressure now mounted from
every direction.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:56.394
He secretly held meetings with
a delegation of Delaware,

00:44:56.394 --> 00:45:02.567
and a delegation from Kentucky,
trying to convince them to

00:45:02.567 --> 00:45:06.678
institute gradual emancipation
plans over time with

00:45:06.678 --> 00:45:11.365
compensation to slave owners
that would free slaves over a

00:45:11.365 --> 00:45:14.033
35-year period.
This was Lincoln the

00:45:14.033 --> 00:45:16.797
gradualist, this was Lincoln
trying to condition public

00:45:16.797 --> 00:45:20.253
opinion.
Delaware at that point only had

00:45:20.253 --> 00:45:22.742
1,800 slaves.
There were far more slaves in

00:45:22.742 --> 00:45:25.230
the District of Columbia than
there were in all of Delaware.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:29.256
But the Delaware delegation
that came to the White House to

00:45:29.256 --> 00:45:32.449
meet with Lincoln told him
unequivocally no,

00:45:32.449 --> 00:45:41.090
they weren't going to touch
slavery for fear of what it

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:45.869
might ignite.
Lincoln waited and waited.

00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:48.047
He was attacked by Horace
Greeley in the New York

00:45:48.047 --> 00:45:49.500
Herald Tribune,
as you know.

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:56.050
Read the famous Greeley letter
in the Johnson Collection.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:58.329
This is the famous passage in
August of '62 where Lincoln

00:45:58.329 --> 00:46:00.650
said, "I will save the Union by
freeing all the slaves;

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.730
or I will save the Union by
freeing none of the slaves.

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:07.340
My aim in the end is to save
the Union."

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.885
But read that entire letter,
not just that quote,

00:46:11.885 --> 00:46:16.756
I'm going to leave that to you;
read the entire letter,

00:46:16.756 --> 00:46:21.389
because he's actually honest on
both sides of the semicolon.

00:46:21.389 --> 00:46:27.199
Look for his semicolon,
and judge both sides.

00:46:27.199 --> 00:46:33.030
He's a crafty cat,
you got to read him closely.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:37.610
Lincoln needed a battlefield
victory, he needed some kind of

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:41.570
battlefield success,
and he gets that of course with

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:44.732
Antietam.
In the wake of Antietam,

00:46:44.732 --> 00:46:48.588
five days afterwards,
22^(nd) September '62,

00:46:48.588 --> 00:46:53.969
Lincoln issued the preliminary
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:46:53.969 --> 00:46:56.982
That preliminary Emancipation
Proclamation said that slaves in

00:46:56.982 --> 00:47:01.134
the United States,
in the states in rebellion,

00:47:01.134 --> 00:47:05.120
would be freed on January
1^(st).

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:12.702
There was a carrot and a stick.
The stick was emancipation and

00:47:12.702 --> 00:47:17.010
conquest, if the Union forces
could ever do it;

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.678
and the carrot was in effect he
invited the Confederate states

00:47:19.678 --> 00:47:22.988
to throw down their arms,
give up the war,

00:47:22.988 --> 00:47:28.710
come back to the Union,
by January 1^(st).

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:33.080
They're not going to do it,
of course, but he was hoping;

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:37.910
or was he hoping?
I'm going to leave you with

00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:41.104
this.
Back in Virginia there was a

00:47:41.104 --> 00:47:44.460
young slave, twenty-two
years-old.

00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:48.848
His name was John Washington.
He'd grown up Fredericksburg,

00:47:48.848 --> 00:47:51.683
Virginia.
Had a white father whom he

00:47:51.683 --> 00:47:54.579
never knew, a slave mother named
Sarah.

00:47:54.579 --> 00:47:57.570
She taught him to read and
write.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:00.369
He grows up an urban slave with
lots of skills,

00:48:00.369 --> 00:48:03.289
highly valued,
probably a brilliant young man.

00:48:03.289 --> 00:48:06.922
He got hired out five times in
the late 1850s and the first

00:48:06.922 --> 00:48:10.585
year of the war.
He married his sweetheart in

00:48:10.585 --> 00:48:14.570
January 1862 in the African
Baptist Church in

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:18.653
Fredericksburg.
And he chose his moment of

00:48:18.653 --> 00:48:23.844
escape at the first appearance
of Union forces along the

00:48:23.844 --> 00:48:28.845
Rappahannock River in
Fredericksburg on the 18^(th) of

00:48:28.845 --> 00:48:32.193
April, 1862.
He left a narrative that he

00:48:32.193 --> 00:48:36.067
wrote after the war that I had
the great good fortune to have

00:48:36.067 --> 00:48:39.683
lopped in my lap and have
recently published a book about

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:42.334
it.
And in that narrative he tells

00:48:42.334 --> 00:48:45.750
this remarkable story of the day
of his escape.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:49.560
He even drew a map of
Fredericksburg of the day of his

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:54.018
escape, including a glossary of
sixteen sites and buildings and

00:48:54.018 --> 00:48:58.698
crossroads on that map,
as though he wanted the world

00:48:58.698 --> 00:49:01.909
to see as well as hear his
story.

00:49:01.909 --> 00:49:04.999
And John tells this story--he's
twenty-two years-old--he tells

00:49:04.999 --> 00:49:07.937
the story of all the white
people evacuating Fredericksburg

00:49:07.937 --> 00:49:09.001
and his mistress,
Mrs.

00:49:09.001 --> 00:49:11.786
Tolliver, is literally packing
her china and her silver,

00:49:11.786 --> 00:49:14.268
and she says one day,
"Now John, you'll be with us

00:49:14.268 --> 00:49:16.700
tomorrow, you'll be with us
tomorrow."

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:19.036
She's assuming his loyalty.
And he says,

00:49:19.036 --> 00:49:22.057
"Yes Misses,
yes Misses, I'll be with you

00:49:22.057 --> 00:49:24.545
tomorrow."
And then his next scene is he's

00:49:24.545 --> 00:49:27.070
got a hotel where he's been
hired out as a steward,

00:49:27.070 --> 00:49:29.989
almost like an assistant
manager, and he describes all

00:49:29.989 --> 00:49:33.293
the white people fleeing the
hotel and fleeing the streets of

00:49:33.293 --> 00:49:35.754
Fredericksburg,
and he says he took the twelve

00:49:35.754 --> 00:49:38.584
workers up on the roof of the
hotel--and the hotel was called

00:49:38.584 --> 00:49:43.050
The Shakespeare,
I kid you not.

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:46.302
He takes all the black workers
up on the roof of the hotel

00:49:46.302 --> 00:49:49.670
where they could see across the
river and see what he called

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.010
"the gleam of the Yankees'
bayonets."

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.521
And then he brought them all
back down into the kitchen and

00:49:56.521 --> 00:50:00.256
he poured a round of drinks,
and he held a toast,

00:50:00.256 --> 00:50:03.289
and the toast was "To the
Yankees."

00:50:03.289 --> 00:50:05.750
And then he instructed his
fellow workers,

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:08.651
he said, to get out of there.
"But," he said,

00:50:08.651 --> 00:50:11.289
"don't get too far from the
Yankees."

00:50:11.289 --> 00:50:14.826
And then John Washington walked
two blocks down to the river,

00:50:14.826 --> 00:50:18.010
he witnessed the formal
surrender of Fredericksburg,

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:20.778
he saw the bridges being burned
by the Confederate forces,

00:50:20.778 --> 00:50:22.429
and he walked one mile up
river,

00:50:22.429 --> 00:50:26.010
and he said he crossed the
river at Fickland's Mill;

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.710
and the old stone ruins of that
mill are still there.

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:32.019
So I know exactly where he
crossed the river.

00:50:32.019 --> 00:50:35.864
He got into a rowboat,
he crossed, and that night he

00:50:35.864 --> 00:50:40.010
slept in the camp of the 30^(th)
New York Volunteers.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:44.246
A captain in that regiment
named Ladd, l-a-d-d,

00:50:44.246 --> 00:50:47.010
formally freed him,
he said,

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.799
based on the law that had just
been passed by Congress

00:50:49.799 --> 00:50:52.010
forty-eight hours earlier in
Washington,

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:58.010
freeing the slaves in the
District of Columbia.

00:50:58.010 --> 00:51:01.719
John Washington spent the rest
of that summer as a camp hand

00:51:01.719 --> 00:51:05.302
and a guide for the Union Army,
all the way through Second

00:51:05.302 --> 00:51:07.385
Manassas.
He dated his arrival in

00:51:07.385 --> 00:51:11.162
Washington, D.C.
as part of the first great wave

00:51:11.162 --> 00:51:15.380
of freedmen into the capital,
as September 1.

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:19.242
And by the following year I
found him in a City Directory

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:23.035
record, living at his first
address on 19^(th) Street in

00:51:23.035 --> 00:51:25.690
Washington.
He had his wife,

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:30.552
his newborn child,
his mother and his 68-year-old

00:51:30.552 --> 00:51:34.300
grandmother living there with
him.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:39.232
Apart from, beneath,
next to, underneath this great

00:51:39.232 --> 00:51:45.152
military and political story,
thousands and thousands of John

00:51:45.152 --> 00:51:49.000
Washingtons are freeing
themselves.

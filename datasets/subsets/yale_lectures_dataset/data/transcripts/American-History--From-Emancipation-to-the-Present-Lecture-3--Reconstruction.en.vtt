00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.300
"I know the nigger.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.667
The employer must have
some sort of punishment.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.667
I don't care what it is,
if you'll let me tie him

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.800
down by the thumbs, or
keep him on bread and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.900
water, that will do.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.600
&nbsp;All I want is just to
have it so that when I get

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.900
the niggers onto my place,
and the work has begun,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.900
they can't sit down and
look me square in the face

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.400
and do nothing."

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.800
Mississippi planter
to a Freedman's Bureau

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
official.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.600
The language is
what the language is.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.300
"Let me find some way or
give me some way that I

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.400
can punish these people so
they'll do the work that I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.700
need them to do."&nbsp; We
can see in this quote how

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.300
politics, labor, and
free will are intertwined.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.300
These are the
themes for this week,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.700
this week being beginning
of the second week of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.300
lectures, although
we're meeting on Friday.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.767
We'll be looking at
the way politics,

00:01:16.767 --> 00:01:19.900
and labor, and free
will are in the mix,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.267
as it were, throughout
this particular era.

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.167
We're moving this week
from the very end of the

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:35.667
Civil War, 1865
to about 1877.

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:37.900
Well, at least
for this lecture,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.767
excuse me, the period
known as Reconstruction.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.800
Now when thinking
about Reconstruction,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.967
the general attempt by
the Union or by the United

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:52.600
States to bring the
Union back together,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.900
when we think
about Reconstruction,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.200
it's really important
to understand that we're

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.300
talking about an
evolving set of ideas,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.267
an evolving set of
political strategies.

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.100
Now I'm simplifying
things when I say it,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.200
there's no doubt about
it, but there is a real

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.600
element of improvisation
during this era,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.100
an experimentation
as the country,

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.767
at the federal level to
the most local level,

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.500
is trying to figure out
how to heal the wounds of

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.500
division.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.400
I want to map out for you
the basic chronology of

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.367
this era and
then we'll be,

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:32.400
I'll be moving forward in
this chronology and then

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.767
working backwards
again back to 1865.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.500
So November of 1864,
Lincoln's reelected.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:48.700
By April of 1865
he's assassinated.

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:54.500
Before he dies, however,
and after his reelection,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.300
he starts working on plans
to complete emancipation.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.900
He had already made
the proclamation,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.100
the
Emancipation Proclamation,

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.600
in 1863, but he was
concerned that after the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.600
war there might be
attempts to see or to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.100
interpret the Emancipation
Proclamation as merely a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.700
wartime resolution and
not something permanent.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.300
And for Lincoln the
die has been cast now.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.500
He's got to find a way
to make emancipation

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.500
permanent.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.667
And so he starts working
with Congress and other

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:28.767
individuals for the
passage of what would

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:30.067
become the Thirteenth
Amendment for the

00:03:30.067 --> 00:03:33.400
Constitution--to
the Constitution.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.500
The first of three
so-called Reconstruction

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.800
Amendments.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.800
The Thirteenth Amendment
abolishes slavery.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.200
Again, making sure
that the Emancipation

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.067
Proclamation is more than
just a wartime measure,

00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:49.700
that it would emancipate
those people who are

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.767
legally still kept
as slaves after the

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:53.767
Emancipation Proclamation.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.500
So looking
directly at this slide,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.900
you're going to see
Lincoln's assassinated in

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.900
1865.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.200
Excuse me.&nbsp; At
the end of 1865,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.400
The Thirteenth Amendment
abolishing slavery is

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.467
passed.

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:10.867
You enter into
phase of Presidential

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:14.067
Reconstruction followed
by Radical Reconstruction.

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:16.300
Then you have the two
other Reconstruction

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.200
Amendments,
the Fourteenth,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.900
establishing the
lines of citizenship and

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.467
guaranteeing due process,
the Fifteenth Amendment,

00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:30.300
guaranteeing the right
to vote that would not be

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.600
mitigated based on
your race or previous

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.700
servitude, and by 1877,
withdrawal of Northern

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.400
troops, the end of
the Reconstruction.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.667
I want you to get this
down in your notes so you

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:42.567
understand the chronology
that I'll be going back

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:46.100
over for the rest of
this particular lecture.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.567
So Lincoln's reelected,
he's building a plan,

00:04:56.567 --> 00:04:58.167
advocating a plan
that would turn into the

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:01.400
Thirteenth Amendment,
calling for a complete end

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400
of slavery in
the United States.

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:08.167
Things aren't looking
good for the South.

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:09.600
It seems that the North
is going to win the Civil

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.700
War.&nbsp; Even before
Lincoln's assassinated,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.100
he seems pretty certain
that's going to be the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.000
case.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.800
And so several
central questions,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.600
now that the tide has
turned in this way,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.100
simply have to
be addressed.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.800
And these are the
questions that are really

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.000
the--I'll be spending
the lecture addressing.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.200
And the questions might
seem kind of strange to

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.267
you, but as you'll see,
they're rather relevant to

00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:42.100
the ways in which whites
and blacks are responding

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.900
to this new era
in US history.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.467
"What does one do with
blacks now they've been

00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:48.467
emancipated?

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:49.800
How will they
be controlled?"

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.900
I use that language
very intentionally.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.000
"Who will do the work and
how will the South survive

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.700
the upheaval?"

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.700
What I want to do--this is
an incredibly complicated

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.500
era, and I've always been
struggling with the right

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.700
way to tell this story.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.067
What I want to do for
the rest of the lecture is

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:13.300
tell the narrative mainly
from a standpoint of high

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:18.400
politics, electoral,
formal processes and

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.967
legislatures,
for instance,

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:24.000
and then I want to go back
over the same time period

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.100
looking at the
social history,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.200
what's sort of
happening on the ground.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200
So it's giving
you the heads up,

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.000
we'll be looping back
over--going back to 1865

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.100
and starting
over in a sense,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.167
looking at these different
narratives to address

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:39.200
these questions.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.267
"What do you
do with blacks,

00:06:40.267 --> 00:06:41.600
how are they going
to be controlled,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.700
who will do the work, and
will the South survive the

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.200
upheaval?"

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.900
Now before
Lincoln is killed,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.000
he starts trying very
aggressively to figure out

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.267
the best way to reunite
the country after the war.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.200
He proposes a
ten percent plan.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.967
It's called the
Ten Percent Plan.

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:05.700
And it is a--the elements
of the plan involve a

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.700
pardon to all Southerners,
except for Confederate

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.767
leaders, they
could not be excused.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:15.867
A pardon would be given to
all Southerners who took

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:19.800
an oath of loyalty to
the Union and supported

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800
emancipation.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.067
Once ten percent of
a state population,

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:24.300
we're talking white males,
once ten percent of the

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.300
state population
agrees to this idea,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.300
signs this loyalty oath,
a new government could be

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.300
formed.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:44.300
Anti-slavery activists,
Congressional radicals,

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:50.100
people who are just
staunch supporters of the

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.300
Union efforts saying,
"This is way too lenient,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.467
we have spilled too much
blood just to say if ten

00:07:56.467 --> 00:07:58.600
percent of the South
goes along with this plan,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.467
everything will
be forgiven."

00:08:00.467 --> 00:08:05.600
The plan goes nowhere, and
Lincoln is assassinated.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.500
Andrew Johnson takes
office and develops a plan

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:16.900
and a series of measures
that taken together are

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.700
captured in what we
call "Presidential

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.700
Reconstruction."

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:23.900
The basic terms
of Presidential

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.567
Reconstruction say that a
general pardon is given to

00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:31.400
the white South, except
for Confederate leaders,

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.067
just like Lincoln's
plan, but Johnson's is

00:08:34.067 --> 00:08:35.200
different.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.267
He says, "We will
pardon everyone except for

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:42.167
Confederate leaders
and wealthy planters."

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:44.700
Johnson was a
man of the people,

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.567
coming from farming
roots, working very hard,

00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:52.000
and saw that
moneyed land-owners,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.900
plantation-owners, were a
real source of many of the

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.867
problems in the South.

00:08:58.867 --> 00:09:00.000
So the pardon to
the white South,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.367
except for Confederate
leaders and wealthy

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:05.567
planters, required
the end of slavery,

00:09:05.567 --> 00:09:07.800
and then it would let
the South set up its own

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800
governments.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.800
And the thinking was
that the white yeoman

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.300
farmers--since
the white planters,

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.667
the wealthy planters,
would not be allowed to be

00:09:15.667 --> 00:09:17.567
the leaders--that
white yeoman farmers,

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:20.200
people working sort of
hand-to-mouth and scraping

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:24.367
by, they would be the one
who would take control of

00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:26.600
these governments and
restructure the society

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.400
more along sort
of, I would say,

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.700
agrarian class
sympathetic lines.

00:09:34.967 --> 00:09:37.100
Plan moves forward, and
Johnson could not have

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.200
been more wrong
about what would happen.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.867
He thought that there
would be a new egalitarian

00:09:40.867 --> 00:09:43.800
ethos in the South, and
what happened is that once

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.500
the whites
take over office,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.300
they begin to answer the
set of questions I posed

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.800
at the
beginning of the class,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.600
in terms of what
to do with blacks,

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.400
with a rather
curious set of answers.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.000
They enacted the
so-called "Black Codes."

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.967
I'm going to skip over
the Black Codes for the

00:10:02.967 --> 00:10:04.767
moment, save that for the
social history part of the

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:05.767
lecture.

00:10:05.767 --> 00:10:06.900
But they enact
the Black Codes.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.067
The answer under Johnson
that the white governments

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:15.167
in the South provide does
not look a whole bunch

00:10:15.167 --> 00:10:17.800
better than slavery for
many African Americans.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.700
The
Republicans in Congress,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:27.400
people who've been staunch
anti-slavery advocates,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.700
are horrified at
Johnson's plan.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.800
Lincoln's was
way too lenient,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.000
Johnson's was stricter,
but it didn't change the

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.500
social order,
as it turns out.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.167
And so Congress, the
Republicans in Congress,

00:10:40.167 --> 00:10:42.200
they now
control the Congress,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:48.400
sets about fighting
Johnson at every turn.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.600
Johnson has a plan,
Congress overrules it.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:55.267
Johnson vetoes
Congress's decision,

00:10:55.267 --> 00:10:57.367
Congress beats
back the veto.

00:10:57.367 --> 00:10:59.300
I mean, the government is
just locked in this battle

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:03.500
at the federal level on
all manner of issues.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.600
During this period of
federal inside battling,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.867
I suppose one
could call it,

00:11:10.867 --> 00:11:13.567
Republican-controlled
Congress pushes through

00:11:13.567 --> 00:11:17.500
the first Civil
Rights Act in 1866,

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500
it pushes through the
Fourteenth Amendment

00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:23.900
delineating the terms
of citizenship and due

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:24.900
process.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.900
Due process is something
you'll be hearing--being

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.200
incredibly important for
freedom struggles as we

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200
move forward
in this class.

00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:36.367
And threatened--the
Congress threatens South's

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:39.300
representation in Congress
if blacks were denied the

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.300
right to vote.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.900
Southern states, seeing
the handwriting on the

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.600
wall about the fact
that Republican-controlled

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.300
Congress, which is a
Northern Congress,

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.300
sees these terms and
just rejects them.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:03.800
Congress gets tough and
ushers in a series of

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.200
reforms that become
known as "Radical

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.667
Reconstruction"
or "Congressional

00:12:07.667 --> 00:12:09.300
Reconstruction," they
are the same thing.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.767
Congressional
Reconstruction and Radical

00:12:10.767 --> 00:12:11.767
Reconstruction.

00:12:11.767 --> 00:12:13.867
Bless you.

00:12:13.867 --> 00:12:17.900
So Johnson has a chance
to make a difference in

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:18.900
Reconstruction.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.867
From 1865, with
Lincoln's assassination,

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:24.667
to 1867, that two
years of experimentation.

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:25.767
Congress says,
"Forget about it,

00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:28.167
we're taking
control here,

00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:30.900
--through sheer
numbers--and enters the

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.300
longest phase of
Reconstruction,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.800
Congressional/Radical
Reconstruction,

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.667
from 1867 to 1877.

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:41.300
And it is a
radical change.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.700
Under this new
Reconstruction plan,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.667
the South is divided into
five military districts.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.300
These districts are
controlled by Northern and

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.300
Republican governments.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.500
There is quite literally a
military occupation of the

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.200
South by federal troops.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.200
Congress pushes through
the Fifteenth Amendment in

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:18.800
1870, guaranteeing blacks,
and this is black males,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.300
please understand,
guaranteeing them the

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.300
right to vote.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.667
If you'd been a
slave, it doesn't matter.

00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:27.100
If you're black,
it doesn't matter.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.567
You have the
right to vote.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.467
After this
amendment passes,

00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:39.800
you start seeing a period
in the eras of different

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.967
Reconstructions, of
incredible positive change

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:46.700
for many African
Americans--not all,

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.800
but many.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.067
And that change often
comes through--you can

00:13:51.067 --> 00:13:55.800
mark it by the
dramatic increase (well,

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.600
increasing from zero to
anything is dramatic,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.500
I suppose) but the
dramatic increase of

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.600
blacks holding office.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.767
You start seeing black
men holding office at the

00:14:06.767 --> 00:14:11.400
local level, being elected
to maybe a town council

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.800
let's say, in some places
being elected the local

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.467
sheriff, which is
really quite astonishing,

00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:18.067
through state governments
and into the federal

00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:19.900
government.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.700
In Congress, and in the
House of Representatives,

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:29.400
and in the Senate.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.167
The change in
representation,

00:14:31.167 --> 00:14:34.267
that there are blacks in
government at all levels,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.500
is astonishing
on many levels.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.767
What is even
more astonishing,

00:14:41.767 --> 00:14:44.967
I'll repeat this fact in
about ten weeks or eleven

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:50.600
weeks, is that the number
of black elected officials

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.700
in the federal government,
House of Representatives

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:59.200
and Senate,
blossoms during this era,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.200
at the end of
Reconstruction,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.867
which I'll start talking
about in the next lecture,

00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:04.900
that those numbers
start to evaporate,

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.000
and the numbers do not
return as far as federal

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.367
representation of blacks
coming from the Southern

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:14.700
states, it does not return
until Bill Clinton is

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.100
elected President.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.300
This is a radical change,
and it is so radical it

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.000
could not be
sustained, as we'll see.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.900
But for the moment,
in 1870 through 1877,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.700
at the level of politics,
electoral politics,

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.300
it seems there is a real
opportunity for change as

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.900
far as
representation--the local,

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.900
the state, the
federal level.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.667
All of these
changes, federal

00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:48.000
occupation--military
occupation of the South,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.400
setting very aggressive
terms about how the

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:55.567
Southern governments could
be reformed and readmitted

00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:57.300
to the Union, having
blacks hold elected

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.800
office, all of these
changes tear at the social

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.800
fabric of the South.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.800
What I want to do for
the next bit is to start

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.100
looking at these changes
sort of on the ground.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.300
Trying to help us
understand the ways in

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:23.300
which things had shifted
fundamentally for whites

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:28.600
and African Americans at
the moment of the end of

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.600
the Civil War.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.800
Now as I alluded
earlier to the question,

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.867
"What are you going
to do with blacks?,

00:16:36.867 --> 00:16:41.667
 the central question of
the era is what one does

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.900
with blacks springs out
of the fact that freedom

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.500
meant different things
to different people.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.000
Freedom meant
liberation for blacks,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.167
and that part is
obvious certainly.

00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:59.067
For whites, at that
moment of liberation,

00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:01.000
those who had
slaves from small,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
you know, small
slaveholding households,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.800
two or three
slaves to plantations,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.800
it means an
immediate loss of labor.

00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:11.700
For blacks and whites it
means an immediate sense

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.500
of profound instability
in the social fabric.

00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:23.200
In a very curious way, it
means for blacks in more

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.100
dangerous
situations--dangerous

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.100
moment.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.100
Slaves' bodies...

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:33.100
It's all right.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp;
Slaves' bodies had value,

00:17:39.967 --> 00:17:40.967
literal value.

00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:42.967
You were property.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.000
If you did something--if
someone thinks you did

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.500
something wrong, black
person offends a white

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:55.867
person's sensibilities,
and a white person decides

00:17:55.867 --> 00:18:00.900
to strike me, hit me,
hurt my body or something,

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.567
that white person has
damaged property that

00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:05.100
belongs to somebody
else and they had to make

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.500
restitution.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.867
After the end of
the Civil War,

00:18:09.867 --> 00:18:14.200
black bodies were, from
a financial standpoint,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.800
they had no value.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.367
Now I remember actually
making this statement

00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:22.767
during a public lecture at
a library during a series

00:18:22.767 --> 00:18:25.800
of lectures in San Diego
and someone got very upset

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.800
with me: "Everybody
has value!"&nbsp; I mean yes,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.600
everybody does have value,
but I'm talking of literal

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.300
dollars and cents.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.500
Black bodies don't have
value after the moment,

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.067
the end of slavery, and
you can do what you want

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:41.067
to with them.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.000
Freedom, you can't
discount it's important

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.267
for African Americans,
the moment of liberation.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.400
But profound instability
you can't ignore either.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.400
Now since the Southern
economy is devastated

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.400
after the war, during
the war and after the war,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.067
since there's the loss of
labor that is profound,

00:19:03.067 --> 00:19:06.700
white planters want a
quick return to plantation

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.300
labor, you got to get
crops in from the field.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.200
And they understood
that we don't have slaves

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.767
anymore, but there's got
to be a way to get gang

00:19:13.767 --> 00:19:17.600
labor reorganized,
have an overseer.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.800
At the same time
black--white planters want

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.100
this, blacks who have
been working on these

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.200
plantations for example,
they've got to find a way

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.900
to put food on
their table,

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.700
but they want to
have economic autonomy,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.500
be it land ownership.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.500
They want to have
their own farms.

00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:40.667
White farm-owners want
blacks to sign labor

00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:42.467
contracts to commit
themselves to work on the

00:19:42.467 --> 00:19:43.967
farms.

00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:46.000
Blacks reject this saying
they expect the federal

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
government to
help them out.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.400
They expect the federal
government to redistribute

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.400
land.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.700
So you have these
really intense conflicting

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.500
expectations that are
directly related to

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.300
conflicting senses of
what freedom meant.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:05.300
And if you look at some of
these items on the screen

00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:11.400
here, I'll start
talking about them,

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.300
you'll start seeing where
these expectations come

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.700
from and why they
would be so conflicted and

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:18.700
complicated.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.900
Now we're back in 1865.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.400
Johnson is the president
and he wants to see the

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.600
Southern economy back on
track and wants blacks

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.667
back to work immediately.

00:20:30.667 --> 00:20:32.667
The question is
how to do it.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.300
He allows Southern
governments to reestablish

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:38.167
themselves
under Presidential

00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:41.500
Reconstruction guidelines,
and once they do,

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.800
a lot of these
white governments start

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.800
answering the question
what to do with blacks and

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.200
establish Black Codes.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:55.067
Now Black Codes were a
series of state-level laws

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:56.600
aimed at answering the
question what to do with

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.600
this newly
freed population.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.400
There was one--there
wasn't a single set of

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:08.100
Black Codes, they
ranged broadly.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.500
Some are more
strict than others,

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.067
but they are,
just taken together,

00:21:14.067 --> 00:21:18.400
a series of legal concepts
that are seeking to create

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.300
a new labor system that
essentially put blacks

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.700
back to work.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.400
Now you look at the codes,
you'll see they authorize

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.400
blacks to
acquire property,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.467
something blacks
certainly wanted.

00:21:31.467 --> 00:21:33.000
It authorized
blacks to marry,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.067
something they were not
allowed to do when they

00:21:35.067 --> 00:21:37.267
were slaves.

00:21:37.267 --> 00:21:40.800
It authorized blacks
to make contracts,

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:44.267
sue and be sued, testify
in court against other

00:21:44.267 --> 00:21:46.100
blacks, mind you.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:49.167
All of these things are
essentially brand new,

00:21:49.167 --> 00:21:51.700
so the Black
Codes on the surface,

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.367
at first glance, seemed to
be a way of trying to give

00:21:55.367 --> 00:21:57.100
blacks some citizenship
rights they didn't have

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.200
before.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.000
But look a
little more closely,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
you'll also see many other
guidelines that make it

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.000
clear that the Black
Codes are about labor

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.500
stabilization.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.000
Now I'm lumping all of
these things together

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
here.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.800
Some state codes required
all blacks to have an

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.200
annual proof of
one-year labor contracts.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.667
Basically you had
to sign up saying,

00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:25.900
"I'm going to work
this plot of land at this

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.200
plantation, I'm going to
work in this shop for the

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.700
next year, and
I won't leave."

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.700
If you leave the job,
you sign that contract,

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.367
you leave the job
before the year is up,

00:22:36.367 --> 00:22:38.200
you will lose all wages
that you had earned up to

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:40.700
that point.

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.600
And you might be subject
to arrest by a white

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.167
citizen.

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:47.800
And notice, I'm not
talking about the white

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.200
Chief of Police or Deputy,
you'd be arrested by a

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.800
white person walking
down the street who says,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.167
"You know, you're not
working the way you should

00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:53.167
be working.

00:22:53.167 --> 00:22:55.000
You clearly should be
on that labor contract,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
and what are
you doing here?"

00:23:02.467 --> 00:23:05.400
Some Black Codes would say
that blacks couldn't steal

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.667
labor or else they risked
a five hundred dollar

00:23:09.667 --> 00:23:11.900
fine, I mean a ridiculous
amount of money.

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.467
Now stealing labor, that
could be interpreted as

00:23:14.467 --> 00:23:16.267
not working hard enough.

00:23:16.267 --> 00:23:19.467
Or that could be
interpreted as when you're

00:23:19.467 --> 00:23:21.500
working this plot of land,
saving a little bit of

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.500
that part for yourself.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.100
Not maximizing the
return on the investment,

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.167
essentially, that white
property-owners had made.

00:23:31.167 --> 00:23:32.600
If you steal labor
you could be fined five

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.800
hundred dollars.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.667
In other states blacks
were forbidden to rent

00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:39.300
land in urban areas.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.000
The notion was if you have
them closer to a city,

00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:47.800
you might have critical
masses developing of

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.400
African Americans who
are property owners,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.100
or at least renters.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.200
They might be able to
develop their own economic

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.000
opportunities
through informal networks,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.300
essentially allowing
blacks to rent property in

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.067
towns gave them
too much autonomy,

00:24:02.067 --> 00:24:03.800
the fear was.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:08.267
Black Codes forced
black women back on farms.

00:24:08.267 --> 00:24:11.467
This way they would not
be seen in public spaces.

00:24:11.467 --> 00:24:12.900
This was all for the
good of the woman,

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.900
this is for
the black women,

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:15.800
they should really be in
their natural habitat.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.200
This would've been the
language of the day,

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.200
by the way.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.200
Black Codes
regulated sexual behavior.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.000
You could not
dress a certain way,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.267
you could not be out
at a certain hour.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.300
Black Codes would
address vagrancy,

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:37.867
idleness, rude
gestures, mischief,

00:24:37.867 --> 00:24:41.200
preaching the Gospel
without a license and so

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200
on.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.067
I mean, incredibly vague.

00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:46.767
If you're just
kind of hanging out,

00:24:46.767 --> 00:24:49.567
you could be in
violation of a Black Code.

00:24:49.567 --> 00:24:54.200
If you're up to no
good, being mischievous,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.600
violation of a Black Code.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.400
And all of these
could lead to fines or

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.600
involuntary
plantation labor.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.000
Black Codes forced
apprenticeships on black

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.300
minors--black
young people,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:14.200
not miners, minors.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.000
They would have to
work without wages.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.300
It's mainly orphans or
children of poor parents.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.767
Many of the Black
Codes said that they

00:25:22.767 --> 00:25:27.100
could--blacks could
not hunt or own weapons.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.600
This is a very
important limitation,

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:32.567
because in the
rural South,

00:25:32.567 --> 00:25:33.567
you shot your food.

00:25:33.567 --> 00:25:37.100
But the idea was, "If we
start giving blacks guns,

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:41.367
they may not shoot
food, they may shoot us."

00:25:41.367 --> 00:25:43.900
So blacks can't
hunt or own weapons.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:45.567
So you take all
these things together,

00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:48.400
and again, I've lumped
many different state's

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.800
Black Codes here, it's
clear that while everyone

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.600
wants the Southern
economy back on track,

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.167
I mean everybody does,
there's no rational way of

00:25:58.167 --> 00:26:01.400
justifying doing it
via the Black Codes.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.600
And so fairly soon after
their being established,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.200
sometimes in
less than a year,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.100
these Black Codes are
declared illegal and are

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.100
eliminated.

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.467
So we're talking about a
very--a brief moment in

00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:13.467
time.

00:26:13.467 --> 00:26:14.500
This sort of underscores
the notion of we're at a

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.500
period of improvisation
and experimentation,

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.900
"We'll try this until
we're told it doesn't work

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.900
any longer."

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.300
In the place of
the Black Codes,

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:27.700
a new labor
system develops.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.700
This one was much
more focused--much more

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.767
explicitly focused upon
labor instead of all the

00:26:31.767 --> 00:26:35.400
morality issues that you
see in the Black Codes.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.667
And this new labor system,
that becomes incredibly

00:26:37.667 --> 00:26:38.867
successful for
what it was,

00:26:38.867 --> 00:26:40.867
is called sharecropping.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.000
Sharecropping
revolves around credit.

00:26:49.167 --> 00:26:52.567
The whites own the
land, the tools,

00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:56.800
the seed, but they
didn't own the labor.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.800
That's what
blacks controlled.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.600
So blacks could
use the land,

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.800
the tools, and the seed,
but they did not get paid

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.600
in cash.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.700
Instead they would rent
the white's property and

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.700
their tools, etcetera.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.200
And in order to
get the seed,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.267
they'd have to go to the
company store for their

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:19.200
purchases.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.800
And the store would be
sort of like Durfee's,

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.500
you know,
exorbitantly priced.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.867
So, you know, if a bag of
seed on the market--I'm

00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:27.867
making up the
numbers here,

00:27:27.867 --> 00:27:29.700
might have
cost one dollar,

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.500
at the company
store maybe it's three,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.967
three credits,
three units,

00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:35.600
or something like that.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.700
So sharecroppers
would pay for their food,

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.267
their seed, etcetera
with their shares,

00:27:40.267 --> 00:27:42.700
their portions of the crop
that they were growing and

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:45.400
later harvesting
for the landowner.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.300
At the end of the year
when the crop in question,

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.400
let's just say
it's cotton,

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.400
which it would've been for
a tremendous amount of the

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.667
system, when the
cotton is taken to market,

00:27:55.667 --> 00:27:59.700
the cotton that black
sharecroppers had planted

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.200
and harvested, they
would not be able to go to

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.300
market with
the cotton crop.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.400
The landowner
would go there,

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:16.100
or his business manager,
and he'd sell the cotton

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.100
at the market rate.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:22.367
Then he would come back
and make a declaration of

00:28:22.367 --> 00:28:25.367
how much he was
able to get for this,

00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:26.700
settle the accounts
privately with the

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.300
landowner, and the
landowner and labor then

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.300
settled their accounts.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:32.300
And then a funny
thing happened.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:35.100
Almost inevitably, at
the end of the year,

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.267
after the planting cycle,
when the crop came--was

00:28:38.267 --> 00:28:39.900
sent to market--and they
came back with the money

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.600
for it, they
looked at the balances,

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.100
and blacks owed money
to the sharecropper,

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.100
Every year.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.700
Let's just say,
again making up numbers,

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.500
that if I'm a sharecropper
and I spent a thousand

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.800
dollars at the company
store to buy all the--rent

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.667
the equipment or buy the
seeds or whatnot for my

00:28:56.667 --> 00:29:00.467
plot of land, I get
this amazing crop,

00:29:00.467 --> 00:29:02.600
it goes off to
market, come back,

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.667
and the guy said
"You know what?

00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:06.967
I was only able to get
nine hundred dollars."

00:29:06.967 --> 00:29:09.400
I now owe a hundred
dollars to the landowner.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.800
What this meant
was I'm stuck,

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:17.867
because it is illegal to
skip out on your debts.

00:29:17.867 --> 00:29:21.300
So the sharecroppers are
required to go back to

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:24.067
work for the same person
in an attempt to eliminate

00:29:24.067 --> 00:29:25.500
the debt.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.100
So you have another--and
the cycle just keeps

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.000
repeating itself, you
never get out of debt,

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000
you're always
working the land.

00:29:35.067 --> 00:29:37.067
What this meant
is that, you know,

00:29:37.067 --> 00:29:39.700
maybe you aren't being
whipped by an overseer,

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.200
but you are in
perpetual servitude,

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.300
as far as your labor
and debt is concerned,

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.800
to the landowner.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.067
You can't escape it.

00:29:49.067 --> 00:29:50.700
Sharecropping
works like a charm.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:54.900
It really begins in
earnest in the mid-1860s

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:59.900
or the later 1860s, it is
still popular in the South

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.267
through the 1940s.&nbsp;
Only with systematic

00:30:03.267 --> 00:30:07.800
mechanization of farms
do you have sharecroppers

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.000
being relieved of that
particular economic cycle.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.967
So white attempts to
answer the question of

00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:18.200
what one could do to
get blacks back to work,

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.967
revolved around
various attempts,

00:30:19.967 --> 00:30:21.100
whether it's through
the Black Codes or the

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.900
sharecropping system, they
revolved around various

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.967
attempts to get--to
recreate slavery,

00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:30.500
but with a different name
and a slightly different

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.500
nature.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.900
As I mentioned
before, black--I mean,

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.167
thinking about
freedom from the black's

00:30:37.167 --> 00:30:40.100
perspective also
meant labor instability.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:44.067
This is why the Black
Codes are so draconian,

00:30:44.067 --> 00:30:45.900
this is why there's
such emphasis on you can't

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:46.900
escape debt.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.900
This was a way to
control blacks.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.300
Now remember,
blacks had expectations,

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.367
too, after the
Civil War was over.

00:30:57.367 --> 00:30:58.967
They wanted their freedom,
they got their freedom in

00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:00.667
the literal sense, there's
no doubt about that.

00:31:00.667 --> 00:31:04.267
But there were also
expectations about land

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:08.200
ownership, that they would
have land they could work

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.567
themselves, and there were
expectations the federal

00:31:10.567 --> 00:31:13.100
government would be the
entity to help blacks

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:20.200
navigate their arrival to
full citizenship rights

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.767
and property ownership.

00:31:21.767 --> 00:31:27.267
And these expectations
grow out of the Bureau of

00:31:27.267 --> 00:31:30.300
Refugees, Freedmen
and Abandoned Lands,

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.300
and out of Field Order 15.

00:31:34.467 --> 00:31:36.200
The Bureau is established,
The Field Order's

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.700
enunciated,
Black Codes enacted,

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.900
all at the same moment,
so these are overlapping

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.900
narratives.

00:31:45.167 --> 00:31:47.700
Expectations about
land, access to it,

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.400
grows from Union General
Sherman's seemingly

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.400
apocalyptic
March to the Sea,

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.000
in which he burned his
way through and across the

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.400
South, and while doing so
issued the famous Field

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.167
Order 15, which declared
that in part--declared in

00:32:05.167 --> 00:32:07.400
part that coastal
land between Charleston,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.600
South Carolina,
and Jacksonville,

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:14.500
Florida, was from this
point on for blacks.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.700
If Congress had
accepted this promise,

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:17.900
or acted upon
this promise,

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:22.300
excuse me, it would've
given over land to roughly

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.367
about two hundred thousand
African Americans.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:32.100
The Field Order,
declared in 1865,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.300
doesn't redistribute
land, but there is the

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:38.867
expectation that the
government is going to do

00:32:38.867 --> 00:32:42.167
so through the likes
of violence perhaps,

00:32:42.167 --> 00:32:46.100
with General Sherman, or
through an orderly attempt

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.567
at giving assistance, and
that's through the Bureau

00:32:48.567 --> 00:32:50.600
of Freed Refugees,
Freedmen and Abandoned

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.900
Lands, more often known
as the Freedmen's Bureau.

00:32:55.567 --> 00:32:57.600
The Freedmen's Bureau
was established in March,

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.700
1865.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.200
It takes a while to get
itself up and running.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.600
It's organized under the
General--Union General

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.600
Otis O.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.867
Howard--that's why Howard
University's named after

00:33:06.867 --> 00:33:11.000
this man, he gave his
land to the university.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.667
The Freedmen's Bureau
had the task of providing

00:33:13.667 --> 00:33:17.900
food, shelter, and medical
aid for the destitute.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.400
That's blacks as
well as whites.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.000
It had the duty of
providing education for

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
freed people.

00:33:30.867 --> 00:33:33.500
To say that there was an
educational system for

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:35.867
blacks is ludicrous up
to this moment in time.

00:33:35.867 --> 00:33:39.800
It's also kind of
ludicrous after the fact,

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:42.500
but they were
working on it.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.000
The Freedmen's Bureau
establishes free labor

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.867
arrangements in
former plantation areas.

00:33:47.867 --> 00:33:54.100
Essentially it's charged
with trying to help blacks

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.100
develop an economic system
where they could sign to

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.500
do work and contract, but
they had freedom in doing

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.500
so.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.000
And the Freedmen's Bureau
is charged with securing

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.100
justice for blacks
in legal proceedings.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.567
The Freedmen's Bureau
record on this front is

00:34:13.567 --> 00:34:15.567
mixed at best.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.300
You know from Field Order
15 that it's the potential

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:21.167
of returning or giving
all this land to blacks

00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:22.300
doesn't really happen.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.067
Freedmen's Bureau,
they're talking about,

00:34:24.067 --> 00:34:26.100
you know, famous
"Forty Acres and a Mule"

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:28.600
ideology.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:31.867
The Freedmen's
Bureau is in control of,

00:34:31.867 --> 00:34:34.100
at one point, eight
hundred and fifty thousand

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:39.200
acres of property,
that instead of being

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.200
transferred to poor
whites and to blacks,

00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:44.300
is transferred back to the
original property owners.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:47.800
So these white planters
lost their land in the

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.000
war, and after
some sorting out,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
they got their
land right back.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.200
The notion of establishing
wage labor contracts,

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.467
that blacks are not going
to be working for a year

00:34:58.467 --> 00:35:00.467
like in the sharecropping
system that would've

00:35:00.467 --> 00:35:06.100
developed, but they
would be paid wages,

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:07.867
doesn't work.

00:35:07.867 --> 00:35:10.100
So the Freedmen's Bureau
doesn't distribute land

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.300
like it promised it would,
fails in establishing wage

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.300
labor contracts.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.767
But it does do something
really remarkable in that

00:35:18.767 --> 00:35:21.100
it starts
establishing schools.

00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.067
Now again, these schools
would not be on par with

00:35:23.067 --> 00:35:27.300
white schools,
not by a long shot.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:28.700
But again, when
you start from zero,

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.700
any change is a
radical change.

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.200
So from 1865, the
moment it was founded,

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.600
to 1869, three thousand
new schools for blacks,

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.800
these are
shacks essentially,

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.800
are established.

00:35:48.567 --> 00:35:50.667
So the Freedmen's Bureau
seems to at least on one

00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:52.700
level be doing
something right,

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.900
making a real change.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:00.300
But by 1872,
it's gone as well.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.300
It collapses.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.600
So it leaves us
with a mixed record.

00:36:07.967 --> 00:36:11.200
The record of
Radical Reconstruction,

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.800
in fact, for much of
the 1870s is mixed.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.367
The North is growing
increasingly weary of

00:36:18.367 --> 00:36:21.800
Southern intransigents,
incredible resistance to

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.900
these kinds of changes.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:28.867
Southerners are tired of
the Northern presence and

00:36:28.867 --> 00:36:31.600
were angry at having
new state constitutions

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.100
written under
Republican-controlled

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.200
governments that, as far
as white Southerners were

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:39.267
concerned, gave away way
too much in terms of the

00:36:39.267 --> 00:36:41.300
rights and
citizenships to black men.

00:36:45.867 --> 00:36:49.067
This period of
sorting out,

00:36:49.067 --> 00:36:54.200
of radical changes at the
electoral level that are

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.800
highly positive for
African Americans,

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:00.500
there's no debating that,
that are of mixed success

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.600
on the ground for the
great majority of African

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.400
Americans--but clearly
it's better to be free

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.500
than slave, despite
all the dangers that are

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.867
incumbent with it.

00:37:09.867 --> 00:37:14.000
It is a period of
incredible stress,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.200
and resentment, and of
different ways in which

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:19.967
whites try to
assert control.

00:37:19.967 --> 00:37:23.900
"What are we going to
do with these blacks?

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.700
Who's going to
control them?"

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.967
One of the first answers
was the establishment of

00:37:28.967 --> 00:37:32.567
the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan,
established in Tennessee

00:37:32.567 --> 00:37:34.600
in 1866.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.500
You didn't need the Klan
prior to emancipation,

00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:40.967
but as far as many
whites were concerned,

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:44.867
you needed something
like the Klan after.

00:37:44.867 --> 00:37:47.600
Klan members would go
after white Northerners

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.467
who were holding
elected office,

00:37:50.467 --> 00:37:52.967
would threaten them
with assassination and

00:37:52.967 --> 00:37:55.700
assassinate some of
them, would go after,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.567
you know, Jews
and Catholics,

00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:00.567
and certainly went
after blacks as well.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.967
Klan forms in 1866, but
remember this is a period

00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:09.200
of military presence from
the North and the South,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.367
and under General Grant,
the Klan is wiped out

00:38:13.367 --> 00:38:15.367
within two years.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.500
For a while.

00:38:19.667 --> 00:38:23.367
But even though the
Klan is wiped out,

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:25.867
you can see
through this era,

00:38:25.867 --> 00:38:31.800
1865 to 1877, rising
tides of resentment,

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.667
chaffing by
white Southerners,

00:38:33.667 --> 00:38:38.567
rising tides of--I
guess one might just say

00:38:38.567 --> 00:38:40.600
impatience by black
Americans in "When are we

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.600
going to have
real change?"

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.500
And real change did come,
but not in the way that

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.500
African
Americans had hoped.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.900
In 1876, it's the
presidential election,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.300
the two men left standing
are Samuel Tilden,

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.867
the Democrat,
and Rutherford B.

00:38:55.867 --> 00:38:57.667
Hayes, Republican.

00:38:57.667 --> 00:38:59.667
Tilden wins the
popular vote,

00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:02.600
but not-- the electoral
vote was unclear because

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.767
the results from the
Southern states were so

00:39:04.767 --> 00:39:07.700
contested.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.667
Sounds like recent
history in fact.

00:39:10.667 --> 00:39:12.567
A compromise
though is reached,

00:39:12.567 --> 00:39:14.967
that Hayes,
the Republican,

00:39:14.967 --> 00:39:17.100
would secure
the Presidency,

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:19.300
but only if he promised
to withdraw federal troops

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.267
from the North--excuse me,
from the South--end the

00:39:23.267 --> 00:39:25.600
military occupation, let
the Southern states all

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.800
come back into the Union.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.967
Hayes accepts the
deal--the North again was

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:32.467
exhausted by
all the struggle.

00:39:32.467 --> 00:39:35.367
And with this famous
compromise of 1877,

00:39:35.367 --> 00:39:37.367
Reconstruction ends.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.100
Now with the end
of Reconstruction,

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.700
we get a new period of
American life generally

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.267
referred to as
"Redemption."

00:39:44.267 --> 00:39:47.100
When the white
South shall rise again,

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.400
they will
redeem themselves.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.267
And I'll be talking about
Redemption in the next

00:39:51.267 --> 00:39:52.267
lecture.

00:39:52.267 --> 00:39:57.200
But I want to turn now
from a moment of high

00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.800
politics--or discussion
of high politics and a

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.500
discussion of
social history,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:05.567
sort of life
on the ground,

00:40:05.567 --> 00:40:11.067
to take a moment to
look at some other types

00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:15.500
of--some primary sources
that helps us understand

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:18.267
what I'll just call the
political culture of the

00:40:18.267 --> 00:40:20.267
moment.

00:40:23.567 --> 00:40:29.500
Very famous image,
"What miscegenation is.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.500
What we are to expect
now that Mr. Lincoln is

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.500
reelected."

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.200
Talking 1864 now.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.767
I mentioned in
the first lecture,

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:41.167
you know, nation states
declaring their cultures,

00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:43.100
and the ideologies,
and their myths on their

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.300
currency.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.667
Well, you can see it as
well in political posters,

00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:48.200
certainly
political cartoons.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:54.200
And this is a--represents
a kind of theme we're

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.400
going to see a fair
amount in this course.

00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.500
Just like the currency of
exalted white womanhood.&nbsp;

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.900
And in this
case, a caricature,

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.700
a very dark-skinned
caricature of an African

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.700
American man.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.367
Caricature as
being of black males,

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:13.700
as you probably already
know and will certainly

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:19.267
know more, very alive and
well during this period

00:41:19.267 --> 00:41:21.500
and certainly even to
today in different ways,

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.500
something we'll talk about
later on in the course.

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.767
But a broadside talking
about "This is what we're

00:41:27.767 --> 00:41:31.500
going to expect now that
Lincoln's been reelected.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.667
All hope's been lost.

00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:37.400
White women and black men
will connect in this sort

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:38.900
of way."

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:41.100
Now this one I think is
interesting 'cause often

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.700
the notion is that black
men are assaulting white

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.967
women, but in this
case, you have--her arm is

00:41:45.967 --> 00:41:48.867
wrapped around, not
in seeming protest.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.467
Be that as it may, the
notion of black and white

00:41:53.467 --> 00:41:56.100
mingling in this sort of
way was a profound threat.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.667
This is 1864.

00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:02.367
Now I talked about the
Freedmen's Bureau and the

00:42:02.367 --> 00:42:04.000
work that it was
assigned to do.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.800
It's there to establish
wage labor contracts,

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.500
and try to help navigate
land redistribution,

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.400
it seemed at first, and
try to help provide basic

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.300
assistance and education
to African Americans.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.600
Well, on the political
campaigns in 1866,

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:21.067
after the
Freedmen's Bureau has been

00:42:21.067 --> 00:42:24.367
established,
you start seeing

00:42:24.367 --> 00:42:27.267
representations--again
another very famous

00:42:27.267 --> 00:42:31.100
poster--representations
of what Reconstruction

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:34.200
actually means, the
Freedmen's Bureau,

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.567
or what--excuse me, the
Freedmen's Bureau means.

00:42:36.567 --> 00:42:38.500
"The Freedmen's Bureau, an
agency to keep the Negro

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.600
in idleness at the
expense of the white man,

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:44.100
twice vetoed by the
President and made a law

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.400
by Congress.

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.000
Support Congress and
you support the Negro.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.100
Sustain the President
and you protect the white

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.500
man."

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:56.000
Another caricature of
an African American in

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.500
tatters, 'cause he doesn't
really need to be dressed;

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.467
he doesn't really
care, barefoot,

00:43:00.467 --> 00:43:02.367
idle, happy as can be.

00:43:02.367 --> 00:43:07.067
The white man looking
on, working very hard,

00:43:07.067 --> 00:43:09.400
trying to earn his
keep, do the right thing.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.500
Now, aside from this being
a very famous poster,

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.567
sort of capturing the
sentiment or resentment

00:43:19.567 --> 00:43:22.067
about the Freedmen's
Bureau being there to

00:43:22.067 --> 00:43:25.200
assist the lazy
African American,

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:29.000
this is also important
to highlight the ways in

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.567
which these narratives
appear in surprising

00:43:31.567 --> 00:43:32.967
places and
ways, or at least,

00:43:32.967 --> 00:43:36.200
ways that we today might
think are surprising.

00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:40.000
This is a campaign
ad, not in Alabama,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
not in Mississippi,
but in Pennsylvania.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:50.300
It's an ad regarding an
election in 1866 pitting

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:59.500
John Geary, Republican,
against Hiester Clymer for

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.900
the governorship
of Pennsylvania.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.400
Clymer's
saying, the Democrat,

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.900
is saying, "If
you support Geary,

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.900
you're supporting this.

00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:20.467
Black idleness."

00:44:20.467 --> 00:44:24.600
From the same
campaign--and this is

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.600
dramatic I think,
pretty dramatic as well,

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.867
but you see the notion of
caricature and ideals of

00:44:30.867 --> 00:44:32.700
white beauty but in a
different sort of way in

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.700
the same campaign,
another broadside.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.400
Pretty direct here.

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.100
Clymer's platform is
for the white man.

00:44:44.367 --> 00:44:46.367
Geary's platform
is for the negro.

00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:51.900
Read the platforms.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:54.267
Again, if you're
supporting Geary,

00:44:54.267 --> 00:44:57.200
represented here by the
grotesque representation

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.600
of a black male, if
you're representing Geary,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.167
you're representing all
of those things that are

00:45:01.167 --> 00:45:03.967
wrong about
excess, idleness,

00:45:06.167 --> 00:45:09.600
illiteracy,
sexual aggression,

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.400
all of these things that
are associated with black

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.800
male,
especially in this case,

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.667
black male behavior.

00:45:14.667 --> 00:45:18.400
If you support Clymer,
you support someone who's

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.200
educated, who's refined,
who's disciplined.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.200
So we go from this
image, which is sort of a

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.900
grotesquery, very busy,
lots of different texts

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:36.967
and representations, to
this one that's cleaner as

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:41.567
it were, more upfront
about its representations,

00:45:41.567 --> 00:45:42.567
to in
1868--these are typical,

00:45:42.567 --> 00:45:46.300
these are not exceptional
advertisements--in 1868 in

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:51.067
the Presidential,
Democratic Presidential

00:45:51.067 --> 00:45:56.300
Primary, New York Governor
Horatio Seymour who was

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:57.900
the Governor of the state
during the New York City

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:04.500
draft riots and who
did not pursue the draft

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.667
rioters, the Irish who
burned parts of the city

00:46:07.667 --> 00:46:09.400
and attacked and killed
people and attacked the

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.667
military, he
didn't punish them,

00:46:12.667 --> 00:46:14.667
which--and he's a
Republican now,

00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:17.100
and people thought that he
was a traitor to the Union

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:19.600
army---or to the
Union--in support of the

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.867
Confederacy.

00:46:21.867 --> 00:46:25.267
Anyway, New York Governor
Horatio Seymour is running

00:46:25.267 --> 00:46:28.300
with Francis Blair
from Missouri for the

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.800
Democratic nomination.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.500
And they announce
their ticket...

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.900
couldn't be more simple.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:39.400
Our motto, "This is a
white man's country,

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.500
let white men rule."

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:47.967
So you see a range of
images here that have been

00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:50.067
popularly distributed.

00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:55.300
Pennsylvania
race for Governor,

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:59.100
presidential primary,
again a northern governor,

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.500
in this case represented
on the presidential part

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:04.100
of the ticket.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.500
A language, a
visual language,

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.800
and sometimes
just flat-out words,

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:13.667
of course, making it
clear that this era of

00:47:13.667 --> 00:47:15.900
transition is
not an easy one,

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:17.900
that there's intransigence
in all different corners

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.267
and all different
regions from different

00:47:19.267 --> 00:47:21.267
perspectives.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.567
And if you're thinking I'm
over-reading these things,

00:47:25.567 --> 00:47:29.667
let me just show this last
image that sends a message

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.300
to Northerners who are
coming down to save the

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.167
South, take
over the South,

00:47:36.167 --> 00:47:37.167
occupy the
South--carpetbaggers,

00:47:37.167 --> 00:47:41.600
people who would load up
their things in a bag from

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.500
the North, come down to
the South and set up a

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:45.100
government, set up
a business and take

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:46.900
advantage of
Southern resources,

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:49.067
certainly a
lot of them did.

00:47:49.067 --> 00:47:51.667
The South had an
answer for these people,

00:47:51.667 --> 00:47:53.000
and you would
see posters up on,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.667
you know, plastered onto a
tree or a wall that would

00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:57.667
simply say this.

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.700
This is the nature of
this visual conversation,

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:05.700
if you will, of
this moment in time;

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.500
a period of
tremendous sorting out,

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.000
a period it seems of
incredible possibility and

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:14.700
hope, as far as the
elected realm is concerned

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:16.900
for African Americans,
a period much more

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.200
complicated on the ground
for African Americans and

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:24.067
for poor whites certainly,
a period of growing or

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:27.467
sustaining intransigence
by white elected officials

00:48:27.467 --> 00:48:30.867
in the South, and a
period where white elected

00:48:30.867 --> 00:48:33.800
officials in the North
aren't quite certain about

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:38.500
this whole period, this
whole idea of trying to

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.700
reconstruct the
Union along these terms.

00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.800
The answers that I posed
at the beginning of the

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.700
class were answered--the
questions I posed at the

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:47.700
beginning of the class
were answered through

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.700
these narratives.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.400
And we'll see some more
answers when we resume

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.467
class the next session
and talk about Redemption.

00:48:53.467 --> 00:48:55.467
Thank you.

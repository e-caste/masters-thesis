00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.494
Student:  Okay,
so today Professor Rae is not

00:00:03.494 --> 00:00:05.828
going to be here and so we're
going to watch two videos

00:00:05.828 --> 00:00:08.129
instead,
one of him and second one is of

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:10.990
Paul Collier talking a little
bit about his book,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.320
but also about recent research
that he's done,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.610
especially on governments and
commodities.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.499
We're going to start with the
first video and then go straight

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:31.900
into the Paul Collier video;
so enjoy.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.300
Prof: Hi there.
 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.110
As you know I'm in Washington
today,

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.731
and Jim Alexander has been kind
enough to preside over the

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:47.431
Monday class,
and I want to get in twenty

00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:53.675
minutes or so of background
thoughts taking us from the

00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:58.818
SELCO case,
where the question was how to

00:00:58.818 --> 00:01:04.694
organize the distribution of
distributed electrical

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:10.218
generating to bottom billion
areas of India.

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:14.885
From that very specific set of
questions to the much larger

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:19.714
question about understanding the
plight of the world's bottom

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:23.269
billion,
and the available strategies

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:26.319
for trying to be helpful to
them.

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:32.280
The main text for this class
and the next is Paul Collier's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.566
Bottom Billion,
which is, while not a page

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:42.060
turning thriller like White
Tiger,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.601
is a very solid,
serious, and substantial piece

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:52.524
of scholarship by somebody who
has been engaged both with the

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:56.769
best of growth economics as a
scholar,

00:01:56.769 --> 00:02:01.010
and with the practical work of
the World Bank,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.670
where he was head of research
for a good long time.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.973
The default assumption in
thinking about the bottom

00:02:09.973 --> 00:02:17.537
billion is to begin with the
world demographic transition and

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:25.353
the thought that most of these
people are the products of stage

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:30.270
two and stage three
demographies;

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.910
where birthrates were vastly
higher than death rates,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.020
and so you had a huge surge in
population and you found--

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.568
and many people in those
societies found themselves in

00:02:45.568 --> 00:02:50.805
the same predicament as the
protagonist in White

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:56.983
Tiger, as being one of way
too many candidates for every

00:02:56.983 --> 00:03:02.008
job and having little or no
market power,

00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:07.080
and consequently,
little or no income.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.971
Collier's take is to say,
"Well let's just grow

00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:14.818
incomes."
 

00:03:14.818 --> 00:03:19.549
It's not a bad approach,
and he's perfectly aware of the

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.878
objections I'm going to make to
it in the next few minutes,

00:03:24.878 --> 00:03:29.229
but let's just catalog what it
means.

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:37.056
The gross domestic product is
at once too broad and too

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:45.318
narrow, as a measure of value
generated by the economy.

00:03:45.318 --> 00:03:53.883
For example,
if a housekeeper and her

00:03:53.883 --> 00:04:00.126
employer,
or his, marry one another and

00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:07.366
he or she continues to keep the
house but now on the basis of a

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:13.789
spousal relationship the cash
goes away and the value is

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:18.463
deducted from the GDP,
while in fact,

00:04:18.463 --> 00:04:21.069
nothing has much changed.
 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:28.502
Or suppose a crime wave hits a
society and enormous damage is

00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:34.449
done to property by crime,
it requires repair;

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.819
those repairs get recorded in
GDP and can easily be mistaken

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.598
for an improvement in the
condition of people living

00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:43.339
there.
 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:48.589
Further, people buy better
locks, video cameras,

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:53.059
perhaps even weapons,
and those too are recorded as

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.060
improvements,
when in fact they really aren't

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.769
improvements.
 

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:58.490
Or take disease.
 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:06.175
A--one society is relatively
healthy and has relatively lower

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:11.829
medical expenses than the other,
yet the second,

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:15.028
the one with the high medical
expenses,

00:05:15.028 --> 00:05:17.759
would be accounted as better
off.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:24.600
Finally, to get just how
mechanical this measure is,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:29.769
if for any reason we were
prepared,

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:33.355
the government say,
was prepared to pay people to

00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:37.689
dig holes and then fill them
back up with the same dirt and

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:44.389
pay them a salary for that,
we would have increased GDP.

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.949
Those are ways in which the
measure is too inclusive.

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.680
There are others ways in which
it is not inclusive enough.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.608
It doesn't include--the saying
"The best things in life

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:02.283
are free,"
well that may not be entirely

00:06:02.283 --> 00:06:05.029
true,
but some of the good things in

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:08.740
life are free,
and those need to be measured

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.100
in an accounting of how well off
a society is.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.377
The leading substitute measured
these days for GDP per capita is

00:06:18.377 --> 00:06:23.322
the human development index as
put forward by the World Bank

00:06:23.322 --> 00:06:28.461
and parallel institutions,
which gives--which takes GDP

00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:31.910
per capita as one part of the
story,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.764
adds to it longevity,
and then supplements that by

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:42.511
adding a measure of education so
you get a somewhat broader

00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:47.959
measure that captures the surge
we see in Hans Rosling's

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:52.913
wonderful data animation as
lives become longer and

00:06:52.913 --> 00:06:55.589
prosperity greater.
 

00:06:55.589 --> 00:07:00.500
So one thing to do is just
tinker with the measure.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:08.240
There's a second set of issues
that have to do with the value

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.790
of income.
 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.579
I've got some childlike
drawings here to share with you.

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:22.004
If we represent the dollar
income of Mr. A on the

00:07:22.004 --> 00:07:26.019
horizontal axis and of Ms.
 

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:30.233
B on the vertical axis,
then GDP for these two people

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:34.769
is calculated just by adding the
one to the other with no

00:07:34.769 --> 00:07:38.660
attention to the distribution
between them,

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.668
so that all the points on this
indifference curve would

00:07:42.668 --> 00:07:46.009
correspond to the same GDP as
one another,

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:49.076
and all the points on this
indifference curve would

00:07:49.076 --> 00:07:50.610
likewise so correspond.
 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.172
Well that's okay,
there's nothing wrong with

00:07:55.172 --> 00:08:01.218
that, except if you want to
infer from it the value shared

00:08:01.218 --> 00:08:05.569
by A and B in the use of that
income.

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:14.920
A generally accepted hypothesis
is that the value of income,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.470
and economists would use a term
utility,

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.795
let me just stick with
value--the value of income first

00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:25.480
increases and then decreases at
the margin,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.389
so that you get an S shaped
curve like this.

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:32.250
On the horizontal axis we have
how much income people get,

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.450
and on the vertical axis how
much value they derive from it.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.061
Now imagine down here around
point A where people have

00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:45.759
precious little income,
so little that they cannot feed

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:48.980
and clothe, and lodge
themselves.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:55.159
Well think of a setting like an
American city and imagine

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:59.022
doubling your income,
annual income,

00:08:59.022 --> 00:09:01.230
from $25 to $50.
 

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.649
Well that would move you a
little ways along the horizontal

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:10.375
axis but it wouldn't lift you up
the vertical axis because it's

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:15.024
not going to make a difference
until you get to some threshold

00:09:15.024 --> 00:09:19.673
where you actually begin to get
increasing returns from rising

00:09:19.673 --> 00:09:23.729
incomes,
as in the zone I've labeled B

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:24.298
here.
 

00:09:24.298 --> 00:09:32.288
Then eventually incomes like
Richard Medley,

00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:35.259
whom we met a month ago or
Paolo Zanonni,

00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:37.168
who we'll meet in a couple of
weeks,

00:09:37.168 --> 00:09:44.205
at their incomes the--so wide a
range of material needs are

00:09:44.205 --> 00:09:50.875
already satisfied that the
marginal dollar gets less and

00:09:50.875 --> 00:09:53.058
less valuable.
 

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:57.971
The implication of this for the
relationship between GDP per

00:09:57.971 --> 00:10:02.799
capita on the one side and a
judgment of how well a society

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:06.379
is doing on the other is that
there's--

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:11.846
we should probably have some
egalitarian bias in the way we

00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:14.110
interpret the numbers.
 

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:20.480
Where most people get to the
level that I'm pointing at here,

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:24.320
where the diminution of
marginal value really sets in,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.780
where most people get to that,
that's kind of where you want

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.087
to be,
and Collier's emphasis on the

00:10:31.087 --> 00:10:34.250
bottom billion responds to that.
 

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.166
The SELCO project,
for example,

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:43.150
which we saw a moment--
saw--well actually I'm speaking

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:47.321
just an hour after class,
which we saw in Wednesday's

00:10:47.321 --> 00:10:53.158
class, is aimed at trying to
bring people up that steep part

00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:57.221
of the curve,
maybe not very far but a little

00:10:57.221 --> 00:11:00.628
ways,
by judiciously providing the

00:11:00.628 --> 00:11:07.186
opportunity to purchase electric
light or electric power for such

00:11:07.186 --> 00:11:12.717
other purposes as running a
sewing machine or preparing

00:11:12.717 --> 00:11:16.100
goods of some kind for sale.
 

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:22.705
The common sense response to
this S curve is to pay special

00:11:22.705 --> 00:11:29.879
attention to people who are near
its bottom and try to find ways

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:35.120
to help them push themselves up
the curve.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:44.980
Now as a sidebar let me just
mention John Rawls,

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:52.408
who published in 1971 a classic
book,

00:11:52.408 --> 00:11:54.720
a book that will be read
hundreds of years from now,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.879
I imagine, called A Theory
Of Justice,

00:11:57.879 --> 00:12:03.274
and Rawls asked people to
imagine that they were behind

00:12:03.274 --> 00:12:07.070
what he called a veil of
ignorance,

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.150
and the idea of the veil of
ignorance is roughly that you

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.120
have no idea who you are.
 

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.826
It's a little like Adam Smith's
device in Theory Of Mortal

00:12:17.826 --> 00:12:19.158
Sentiments.
 

00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:23.509
But the question is,
if you had no idea who you were

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:28.370
before we set up the basic
institutions for a country,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:32.240
or for the world if we think of
it on a global scale,

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.735
what would be your way of
structuring alternative

00:12:37.735 --> 00:12:44.491
arrangements so that you could
find one that you thought was

00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:47.947
best from--
for you from behind this veil

00:12:47.947 --> 00:12:51.481
of ignorance and on which you
could agree with everyone else

00:12:51.481 --> 00:12:52.918
behind the same veil?
 

00:12:52.918 --> 00:13:00.652
His idea, stated way too
simply, is that you should

00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:08.693
maximize the welfare of the
least advantaged group in

00:13:08.693 --> 00:13:10.548
society.
 

00:13:10.548 --> 00:13:13.840
The intuition is that that
group would be unskilled labor;

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.155
and that doesn't mean that you
should knock down inequalities

00:13:20.155 --> 00:13:21.629
necessarily.
 

00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:29.000
Indeed, if allowing bankers,
engineers,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.250
and entrepreneurs to reap
substantial and very unequal

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:39.799
benefits from their work will
ultimately read down to the

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:44.259
benefit of this unskilled labor
stratum,

00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:46.558
then that's great.
 

00:13:46.558 --> 00:13:55.125
A Rawlsian picture of the
indifference curves which before

00:13:55.125 --> 00:14:02.639
utilitarianism just run at minus
45º here,

00:14:02.639 --> 00:14:07.649
Rawls' are L shaped,
and so if we're here,

00:14:07.649 --> 00:14:11.889
so that this person is way
better off than this person,

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:14.668
we try to move to a higher
indifference curve from the

00:14:14.668 --> 00:14:17.080
point of view of the less
advantaged person;

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:20.450
and symmetrically here we try
to move in this direction,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:24.428
so that the L shaped
indifference curves,

00:14:24.428 --> 00:14:27.946
if there were just two people
in the society would drive us to

00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:31.182
seek the highest one,
and it would have a powerful

00:14:31.182 --> 00:14:35.072
middle-of-the-road bias to it,
but it wouldn't have so

00:14:35.072 --> 00:14:39.077
powerful an egalitarian kick
that it would knock down

00:14:39.077 --> 00:14:43.855
equality to an extent which hurt
even the less skilled parts of

00:14:43.855 --> 00:14:45.320
the workforce.
 

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.033
Societies--and we know
societies that have reached that

00:14:51.033 --> 00:14:57.379
level, in my judgment Castro's
Cuba is just such a case and I

00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:00.653
know it fairly well;
North Korea,

00:15:00.653 --> 00:15:04.080
which I know much less well,
appears to be such a case.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.668
Okay so that's all by way of
background,

00:15:08.668 --> 00:15:15.027
and now I just want to talk
rather briefly about the

00:15:15.027 --> 00:15:21.259
introductory series of traps in
Collier's book,

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:27.160
and the traps are his way of
summarizing things that can go

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:33.369
very wrong for a country and put
it way behind the rest of the

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:36.320
world in economic growth.
 

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.952
Now as background,
Collier is really thinking

00:15:39.952 --> 00:15:43.668
about what we would call
"emerging market

00:15:43.668 --> 00:15:45.320
countries."
 

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.316
He's not thinking about
Germany, Japan,

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:51.840
Canada, or the states.
 

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:56.678
He's thinking about India,
Bangladesh,

00:15:56.678 --> 00:16:04.798
Kenya, Zimbabwe,
Bolivia, and Mexico,

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:11.822
countries which are just
finishing the world demographic

00:16:11.822 --> 00:16:15.995
transition,
and are relatively late

00:16:15.995 --> 00:16:21.389
entrants as full players in
capitalist development.

00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:26.611
The majority of them--and
Collier gives very little stress

00:16:26.611 --> 00:16:29.658
to this,
and he probably should give

00:16:29.658 --> 00:16:33.886
more--the majority of these
countries were colonial sites

00:16:33.886 --> 00:16:39.743
for European powers,
and India is just such a case,

00:16:39.743 --> 00:16:43.139
for example--
and the British Empire was

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:43.720
enormous.
 

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.580
Other countries were subject to
the Dutch,

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.320
the French, and other--and the
Spanish,

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.990
and the Spanish actually are
quite important,

00:16:54.990 --> 00:17:01.470
European powers which treated
them as subordinate economies

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:07.615
and structured their governments
to the advantage of the

00:17:07.615 --> 00:17:10.410
metropolitan country.
 

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:16.573
Trap one may be,
be a colonial site,

00:17:16.573 --> 00:17:20.798
and be set back by it.
 

00:17:20.798 --> 00:17:23.654
The other side to that story is
that the colonial powers

00:17:23.654 --> 00:17:25.680
sometimes left something good
behind.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:32.910
The extraordinary quality of
technical education in India,

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:39.526
for example,
is in part an outgrowth of

00:17:39.526 --> 00:17:48.231
British education and the
systematic inculcation of

00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:53.630
British educational values.
 

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:56.465
Wouldn't want to go too far
stressing that,

00:17:56.465 --> 00:17:58.289
but it's there somewhere.
 

00:17:58.289 --> 00:18:07.017
Okay so the Collier traps;
the first one is what he calls

00:18:07.017 --> 00:18:11.990
a conflict trap,
and according to him 73% of the

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:19.549
bottom billion live in countries
which are now in civil wars or

00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:23.940
have recently been in civil
wars.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:32.287
That's a stunning number,
and the world which occupies

00:18:32.287 --> 00:18:39.058
the front page of every major
newspaper--

00:18:39.058 --> 00:18:47.163
Somalia, Iraq,
the incredible mess in

00:18:47.163 --> 00:18:53.848
Afghanistan,
many other less dramatic cases,

00:18:53.848 --> 00:19:00.361
these are all countries where
civil strife has defined life to

00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:07.298
a considerable degree in let's
say the last twenty-five years.

00:19:07.298 --> 00:19:13.980
Well the--Collier spends some
time asking the causes of that.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:19.663
He rejects the common sense
popular explanation is ethnic

00:19:19.663 --> 00:19:20.778
conflict.
 

00:19:20.778 --> 00:19:25.565
He says that ethnic conflict is
actually quite a lot less

00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:28.298
important than simple poverty.
 

00:19:28.298 --> 00:19:35.308
That countries with very low
GDP per capita are greatly--

00:19:35.308 --> 00:19:40.796
at much greater risk of civil
war than countries with higher

00:19:40.796 --> 00:19:46.088
GDP per capita,
and that countries with growing

00:19:46.088 --> 00:19:51.808
GDP are more secure than those
with static GDP,

00:19:51.808 --> 00:19:54.990
particularly static GDP at a
low level.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.253
Not much news in that but it's
actually very important because

00:19:59.253 --> 00:20:03.098
if you think about the logic of
capital development--

00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:07.788
capitalist development,
and you take either the Coase

00:20:07.788 --> 00:20:13.828
Theorem or de Soto's development
of the Coase Theorem seriously,

00:20:13.828 --> 00:20:20.160
which I do and I urge you to,
it's built on the foundation of

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:24.170
the Westphalia nation state
system,

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.196
which came into being in the
middle of the seventeenth

00:20:26.196 --> 00:20:26.578
century.
 

00:20:26.578 --> 00:20:30.796
Where civil wars are still in
progress that system isn't

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:34.710
there;
a civil war is indicative of a

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.753
failed state,
and a failed state can't

00:20:38.753 --> 00:20:44.040
perform the capitalizing
functions of government which

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.930
are so central to the story de
Soto tells us,

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.940
and about which I think he is
very right.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:21:03.900
The palliatives for this are
not obvious.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:09.317
One thing we've pretty much
learned is that third party

00:21:09.317 --> 00:21:13.429
interventions in civil wars,
by and large,

00:21:13.429 --> 00:21:16.640
are not terribly successful.
 

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.000
The second of his traps is the
natural resource trap,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.269
where the standard case would
be oil,

00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:30.311
but it could be any other
commodity that is exported at

00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:35.378
great value with--
and which can be harvested and

00:21:35.378 --> 00:21:40.567
processed and shipped without
developing a huge economic

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:46.413
infrastructure,
or a nimbly functioning

00:21:46.413 --> 00:21:49.410
internal market.
 

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:56.779
The gist of this one hinges on
what he calls Dutch disease and

00:21:56.779 --> 00:22:04.151
the idea here is that when the
Dutch began to export North Sea

00:22:04.151 --> 00:22:11.140
oil at great profit to their--
to the value of their currency

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:16.708
the inflation in the value of
the currency made their other

00:22:16.708 --> 00:22:22.565
export products less and less
competitive and caused a kind of

00:22:22.565 --> 00:22:25.349
lethargy in the country.
 

00:22:25.349 --> 00:22:26.769
That's one piece of it.
 

00:22:26.769 --> 00:22:32.237
The other piece,
which I think is actually more

00:22:32.237 --> 00:22:39.367
important, has to do with the
relationship between democratic

00:22:39.367 --> 00:22:44.358
rule and oil or other export
products.

00:22:44.358 --> 00:22:48.621
If you'll look carefully at
page forty-three of Collier's

00:22:48.621 --> 00:22:51.742
book,
he tells a story which is

00:22:51.742 --> 00:22:54.617
actually,
it's a fairly subtle story and

00:22:54.617 --> 00:22:59.057
I think it's a true story,
and the gist of it is that

00:22:59.057 --> 00:23:05.065
where an economy functions
largely by exporting something

00:23:05.065 --> 00:23:09.505
like oil,
that the impact of democratic

00:23:09.505 --> 00:23:15.700
government on the economy is to
reduce the rate of growth.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:23.442
Whereas, in economies where
that form of export production

00:23:23.442 --> 00:23:29.253
is not important,
democratic government and the

00:23:29.253 --> 00:23:34.801
rule of law relates to an
increasing rate of economic

00:23:34.801 --> 00:23:35.868
growth.
 

00:23:35.868 --> 00:23:41.811
His slightly smart aleck term
for this is survival of the

00:23:41.811 --> 00:23:48.096
fattest,
and if you look at the behavior

00:23:48.096 --> 00:23:55.325
of classic oil states,
they seem to respond to this

00:23:55.325 --> 00:24:01.391
and once you have an
authoritarian government with an

00:24:01.391 --> 00:24:07.338
oil export economy much of what
happens is ugly.

00:24:07.338 --> 00:24:14.390
A good part of the ugliness we
see in Russia these days,

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.338
for example,
is made possible,

00:24:17.338 --> 00:24:23.075
some might say inevitable,
by its powerful export

00:24:23.075 --> 00:24:28.140
resources in petroleum and
natural gas.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:36.125
The land lock trap,
and here the classic case that

00:24:36.125 --> 00:24:45.208
will concern us will be Bolivia,
where we'll do a case two weeks

00:24:45.208 --> 00:24:51.528
from now about trying to improve
water resources in a major

00:24:51.528 --> 00:24:57.365
Bolivian city,
and being land locked is a bad

00:24:57.365 --> 00:24:58.269
thing.
 

00:24:58.269 --> 00:25:03.255
It's not hard to capture the
intuition of that because

00:25:03.255 --> 00:25:08.804
commerce with distant states
historically is largely done by

00:25:08.804 --> 00:25:14.730
marine transportation and absent
ports of your own you depend on

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:19.818
ports of other countries,
so that, for example,

00:25:19.818 --> 00:25:24.769
Switzerland depends on Italian
and German ports,

00:25:24.769 --> 00:25:33.838
and Uganda or Rwanda would
depend on Kenyan ports,

00:25:33.838 --> 00:25:40.997
and it's probably a better idea
to depend on port systems like

00:25:40.997 --> 00:25:44.497
those of Italy,
or Germany, than like those of

00:25:44.497 --> 00:25:46.440
Kenya because they're far more
developed.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.990
But there's another side to
this story,

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:55.160
which is that,
as Collier points out,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.488
having rich countries for
neighbors means you have large

00:25:59.488 --> 00:26:03.578
markets which don't require
ocean going shipping,

00:26:03.578 --> 00:26:09.135
so that, for example,
Germany and Italy are not just

00:26:09.135 --> 00:26:15.237
in the way of exports from
Switzerland but become markets

00:26:15.237 --> 00:26:21.230
for those exports and breed a
great deal of wealth.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:27.847
Indeed Collier shows that a 1%
increase in GDP per capita in a

00:26:27.847 --> 00:26:34.140
neighboring state correlates
generally with about .4% of an

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:39.240
increase in GDP in the land
locked country.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.960
We're almost done here.
 

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:51.019
The last one is bad states are
really bad for economies.

00:26:51.019 --> 00:26:53.750
This one is a no-brainer.
 

00:26:53.750 --> 00:27:00.098
There are two main ways for
states to be bad.

00:27:00.098 --> 00:27:07.670
By being weak and unable to
enforce the rule of law,

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:13.720
tune into tonight's 6:30 world
news,

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:20.727
and I prophesy five days in
advance that there will be an

00:27:20.727 --> 00:27:27.108
account of death and destruction
in Afghanistan,

00:27:27.108 --> 00:27:33.325
where the Taliban challenged
the state for control of

00:27:33.325 --> 00:27:40.734
territory and our soldiers try
to bring a degree of order under

00:27:40.734 --> 00:27:45.866
almost impossible conditions;
so weak states,

00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:49.430
failed states,
the famous case of Somalia with

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.358
its pirates would be another
case.

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:58.148
Iraq after the--after our
intervention was for a period a

00:27:58.148 --> 00:28:04.662
failed state and it gives every
indication of remaining either a

00:28:04.662 --> 00:28:11.597
failed state or a--
why don't I not prophesy about

00:28:11.597 --> 00:28:14.016
Iraq;
I don't need to have a dog in

00:28:14.016 --> 00:28:14.640
that fight.
 

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:20.230
The other bad government story
is kleptocracy,

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.990
and where the government or the
elites at the top of the

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:30.530
government use it as a means for
collecting rent from the rest of

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:31.568
society.
 

00:28:31.568 --> 00:28:35.837
It is extraordinarily
destructive to the economy

00:28:35.837 --> 00:28:41.377
because it takes away all the
conditions which allow people to

00:28:41.377 --> 00:28:46.282
make investments and execute
business projects and sell

00:28:46.282 --> 00:28:51.096
products in a sufficiently
predictable way to grow the

00:28:51.096 --> 00:28:52.548
economy.
 

00:28:52.548 --> 00:29:00.179
The other clip you're about to
see is Paul Collier himself in a

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:05.344
TED talk explaining,
no doubt better than I can,

00:29:05.344 --> 00:29:09.838
what it is that The Bottom
Billion is about.

00:29:09.838 --> 00:29:48.920
I look forward to seeing you on
Wednesday.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.537
Paul Collier:
 So can we dare to be

00:29:50.537 --> 00:29:51.048
optimistic?
 

00:29:51.048 --> 00:29:54.653
Well the thesis of The
Bottom Billion is that a

00:29:54.653 --> 00:29:58.196
billion people have been stuck
living in economies that have

00:29:58.196 --> 00:30:02.808
been stagnate for forty years,
and hence, diverging from the

00:30:02.808 --> 00:30:04.278
rest of mankind.
 

00:30:04.278 --> 00:30:07.440
So the real question to pose is
not "can we be

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.157
optimistic,"
it's "how can we give

00:30:10.157 --> 00:30:13.130
credible hope to that billion
people?"

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.531
That, to my mind,
is the fundamental challenge

00:30:16.531 --> 00:30:18.118
now of development.
 

00:30:18.118 --> 00:30:23.630
What I'm going to offer you is
a recipe,

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.663
a combination,
of the two forces that changed

00:30:26.663 --> 00:30:30.005
the world for good,
which is the alliance of

00:30:30.005 --> 00:30:33.200
compassion and enlightened self
interest.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:39.542
Compassion because a billion
people are living in societies

00:30:39.542 --> 00:30:43.700
that have not offered credible
hope.

00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:47.430
That is a human tragedy.
 

00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:51.520
Enlightened self interest
because if that economic

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.529
divergence continues for another
forty years,

00:30:55.529 --> 00:31:01.358
combined with social
integration globally,

00:31:01.358 --> 00:31:04.500
it will build a nightmare for
our children.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.688
We need compassion to get
ourselves started,

00:31:08.688 --> 00:31:14.240
and enlightened self interest
to get ourselves serious.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.130
That's the alliance that
changes the world.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.248
So what does it mean to get
serious about providing hope for

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:25.069
the bottom billion?
 

00:31:25.069 --> 00:31:27.690
What can we actually do?
 

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:33.825
Well a good guide is to think
what did we do last time the

00:31:33.825 --> 00:31:40.282
rich world got serious about
developing another region of the

00:31:40.282 --> 00:31:41.358
world?
 

00:31:41.358 --> 00:31:43.443
That gives us,
it turns out,

00:31:43.443 --> 00:31:46.840
quite a good clue,
except you have to go back

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.538
quite a long time.
 

00:31:48.538 --> 00:31:53.148
The last time the rich world
got serious about developing

00:31:53.148 --> 00:31:56.358
another region was in the late
1940s.

00:31:56.358 --> 00:32:01.969
The rich world is you,
America, and the region that

00:32:01.969 --> 00:32:07.130
needed to be developed was my
world, Europe.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.220
It was post-war Europe.
 

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.680
Why did America get serious?
 

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:17.078
It wasn't just compassion for
Europe, though there was that.

00:32:17.078 --> 00:32:22.480
It was you knew you had to,
because in the late 1940s,

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:26.007
country after country in
central Europe was falling into

00:32:26.007 --> 00:32:29.781
the Soviet block,
and so you knew you had no

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:30.548
choice.
 

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:33.930
Europe had to be dragged into
economic development.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:37.390
What did you do last time you
got serious?

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:41.272
Well yes, you had a big aid
program, thank you very much,

00:32:41.272 --> 00:32:44.393
that was Marshall Aid,
we need to do it again,

00:32:44.393 --> 00:32:46.890
and aid is part of the
solution.

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:48.788
But what else did you do?
 

00:32:48.788 --> 00:32:54.868
Well you tore up your trade
policy and totally reversed it.

00:32:54.868 --> 00:32:58.830
Before the war,
America had been highly

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:03.404
protectionist;
after the war you opened your

00:33:03.404 --> 00:33:06.583
markets to Europe,
you dragged Europe into the

00:33:06.583 --> 00:33:08.701
then global economy,
which was your economy,

00:33:08.701 --> 00:33:11.580
and you institutionalized that
trade globalization through

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.358
founding the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade;

00:33:14.358 --> 00:33:17.309
so total reversal of trade
policy.

00:33:17.309 --> 00:33:19.440
Did you do anything else?
 

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.220
Yes, you totally reversed your
security policy.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:26.130
Before the war your security
policy had been isolationist;

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.790
after the war,
you tear that up,

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.598
you put 100,000 troops in
Europe for over forty years;

00:33:33.598 --> 00:33:37.619
so total reversal of security
policy.

00:33:37.619 --> 00:33:39.000
Anything else?
 

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.538
Yes, you tear up the eleventh
commandment: national

00:33:43.538 --> 00:33:44.808
sovereignty.
 

00:33:44.808 --> 00:33:48.583
Before the war you treated
national sovereignty as so

00:33:48.583 --> 00:33:53.009
sacrosanct that you weren't even
willing to join the League of

00:33:53.009 --> 00:33:54.886
Nations;
after the war,

00:33:54.886 --> 00:33:58.593
you found the United Nations,
you found the Organization for

00:33:58.593 --> 00:34:00.509
Economic Cooperation and
Development,

00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:03.925
you found the IMF,
you encouraged Europe to create

00:34:03.925 --> 00:34:07.508
the European Community;
all systems for mutual

00:34:07.508 --> 00:34:09.179
government support.
 

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:16.264
That is still the waterfront of
effective policies--aid,

00:34:16.264 --> 00:34:20.130
trade, security,
governance.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.048
Of course the details of policy
are going to be different

00:34:23.048 --> 00:34:25.030
because the challenge is
different,

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.961
it's not rebuilding Europe,
and it's reversing the

00:34:28.961 --> 00:34:34.260
divergence of the bottom billion
so that they actually catch up.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.969
Is that easier or harder?
 

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:41.659
We need to be at least as
serious as we were then.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:47.900
Now today I'm going to take
just one of those four,

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.079
I'm going to take the one that
sounds the weakest,

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:54.699
the one that's just motherhood
and apple pie:

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:57.025
governance;
mutual systems of support for

00:34:57.025 --> 00:35:00.065
governance,
and I'm going to show you one

00:35:00.065 --> 00:35:04.079
idea and how we could do
something to strengthen

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:07.974
governance,
and I'm going to show that that

00:35:07.974 --> 00:35:10.420
is enormously important now.
 

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:17.809
The opportunity we're going to
look to is a genuine basis for

00:35:17.809 --> 00:35:23.846
optimism about the bottom
billion, and that is the

00:35:23.846 --> 00:35:26.309
commodity booms.
 

00:35:26.309 --> 00:35:31.596
The commodity booms are pumping
unprecedented amounts of money

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:36.449
into many, though not all,
of the countries of the bottom

00:35:36.449 --> 00:35:37.489
billion.
 

00:35:37.489 --> 00:35:42.623
Partly they're pumping money in
because commodity prices are

00:35:42.623 --> 00:35:47.804
high, but it's not just that;
there's also a range of new

00:35:47.804 --> 00:35:49.000
discoveries.
 

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.505
Uganda has just discovered oil
at about the most disastrous

00:35:53.505 --> 00:35:55.059
location on earth.
 

00:35:55.059 --> 00:35:59.809
Ghana's discovered oil;
Guinea has got a huge new

00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:03.380
exploitation of iron ore coming
out of the ground;

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.820
so a mass of new discoveries.
 

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:11.175
Between them,
these new revenue flows dwarf

00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:11.940
aid.
 

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.489
Just to give you one example,
and gold ore alone is getting

00:36:16.489 --> 00:36:19.940
$50 billion dollars a year in
oil revenue.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.322
The entire aid flows to the
sixty countries of the bottom

00:36:23.322 --> 00:36:25.619
billion last year were $34
billion,

00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:29.831
so the flow of resources from
the commodity booms to the

00:36:29.831 --> 00:36:32.820
bottom billion are without
precedent.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.429
There's the optimism.
 

00:36:36.429 --> 00:36:41.309
The question is how is it going
to help their development?

00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:44.639
It's a huge opportunity for
transformation of development.

00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:46.320
Will it be taken?
 

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.027
So here comes a bit of science,
and this is a bit of science

00:36:50.027 --> 00:36:53.610
I've done since The Bottom
Billion, so it's new.

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:57.570
I've looked to see what is the
relationship between higher

00:36:57.570 --> 00:37:01.322
commodity prices of exports and
the growth of commodity

00:37:01.322 --> 00:37:04.800
exporting countries,
and I've looked globally.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.168
I've taken all the countries in
the world for the last forty

00:37:07.168 --> 00:37:09.195
years,
and looked to see what the

00:37:09.195 --> 00:37:14.563
relationship is,
and so the short run--the first

00:37:14.563 --> 00:37:19.320
five to seven years is just
great.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:22.980
In fact its hunky dory,
everything goes up.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:27.590
You get more money because your
terms of trade have improved,

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:31.202
but also that drives up output
across the board,

00:37:31.202 --> 00:37:33.969
so GDP goes up a lot,
fantastic.

00:37:33.969 --> 00:37:35.469
That's the short run.
 

00:37:35.469 --> 00:37:37.909
How about the long run?
 

00:37:37.909 --> 00:37:43.347
Come back fifteen years
later--well the short run it's

00:37:43.347 --> 00:37:48.480
hunky dory, but the long run
it's humpty dumpty.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:52.045
You go up in the short run,
but then most societies

00:37:52.045 --> 00:37:56.469
historically have ended up worse
than if they'd had no booms at

00:37:56.469 --> 00:37:57.039
all.
 

00:37:57.039 --> 00:38:01.099
That is not a forecast about
how commodity prices go,

00:38:01.099 --> 00:38:03.179
it's a forecast of the
consequences,

00:38:03.179 --> 00:38:08.449
the long-term consequences for
growth of an increase in prices.

00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:11.429
What goes wrong?
 

00:38:11.429 --> 00:38:14.289
Why is there this resource
curse, as it's called?

00:38:14.289 --> 00:38:18.079
Again, I looked at that,
and it turns out that the

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:21.559
critical issue is the level of
goverannce,

00:38:21.559 --> 00:38:25.581
the initial level of economic
governance when the resource

00:38:25.581 --> 00:38:26.639
booms accrue.
 

00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:29.474
In fact, if you've got good
enough governance,

00:38:29.474 --> 00:38:31.239
there is no resource boom.
 

00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:35.043
You go up in the short term and
then you go up even more in the

00:38:35.043 --> 00:38:35.780
long term.
 

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.063
That's Norway,
the richest country in Europe,

00:38:38.063 --> 00:38:39.829
it's Australia,
and it's Canada.

00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:44.411
The resource curse is entirely
confined to countries below a

00:38:44.411 --> 00:38:46.429
threshold of governance.
 

00:38:46.429 --> 00:38:49.695
They still go up in the short
run, that's what we see across

00:38:49.695 --> 00:38:51.800
in the bottom billion at the
moment;

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.550
the best growth rates they've
had ever.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:59.320
The question is whether the
short run will persist.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:03.751
We've got governments
historically over the last forty

00:39:03.751 --> 00:39:05.530
years;
it hasn't.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:09.001
There's countries like Nigeria,
which are worse off than if

00:39:09.001 --> 00:39:10.380
they'd never had oil.
 

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:15.945
There's a threshold level above
which you go up in the long

00:39:15.945 --> 00:39:21.126
term, below which you go down,
just a benchmark of that

00:39:21.126 --> 00:39:22.469
threshold.
 

00:39:22.469 --> 00:39:26.659
It's about the governance level
of Portugal in the mid-1980s.

00:39:26.659 --> 00:39:30.612
The question is,
is the bottom billion above or

00:39:30.612 --> 00:39:32.590
below that threshold?
 

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:37.539
Now there's one big change
since the commodity booms of the

00:39:37.539 --> 00:39:41.380
1970s, and that is the spread of
democracy.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.764
I thought maybe that is the
thing which has transformed

00:39:44.764 --> 00:39:46.960
governance in the bottom
billion.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.603
Maybe we can be more optimistic
because of the spread of

00:39:49.603 --> 00:39:50.179
democracy.
 

00:39:50.179 --> 00:39:51.570
So I looked.
 

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:56.416
Democracy does have significant
effects, and unfortunately,

00:39:56.416 --> 00:39:57.920
they're adverse.
 

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.434
Democracies make even more of a
mess of these resource booms

00:40:02.434 --> 00:40:03.889
than autocracies.
 

00:40:03.889 --> 00:40:07.110
At that stage I just wanted to
abandon the research,

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:11.452
but it turns out that democracy
is a little bit more complicated

00:40:11.452 --> 00:40:14.340
than that,
because there are two distinct

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:15.800
aspects of democracy.
 

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.239
There's electoral competition,
which determines how you

00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:21.532
acquire power,
and there's checks and

00:40:21.532 --> 00:40:24.590
balances, which determine how
you use power.

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:28.706
It turns out that electoral
competition is the thing that's

00:40:28.706 --> 00:40:33.344
doing the damage with democracy,
whereas strong checks and

00:40:33.344 --> 00:40:36.449
balances makes resource booms
good.

00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:39.762
And so what the countries of
the bottom billion need is very

00:40:39.762 --> 00:40:41.389
strong checks and balances.
 

00:40:41.389 --> 00:40:45.342
They haven't got them;
they got instant democracy in

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:48.760
the 1990s, elections without
checks and balances.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.804
How can we help improve
governments and introduce checks

00:40:53.804 --> 00:40:55.179
and balances?
 

00:40:55.179 --> 00:40:57.697
In all of the societies of the
bottom billion,

00:40:57.697 --> 00:41:00.268
there are intense struggles to
do just that.

00:41:00.268 --> 00:41:05.644
The simple proposal is that we
should have some international

00:41:05.644 --> 00:41:08.490
standards,
which will be voluntary,

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:12.695
that we should spell out the
key decision points that need to

00:41:12.695 --> 00:41:17.110
be taken in order for it to
harness these resource revenues.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.733
We know these international
standards work because we've

00:41:20.733 --> 00:41:21.920
already got one.
 

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.235
It's called the Extractive
Industries Transparency

00:41:24.235 --> 00:41:24.849
Initiative.
 

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:29.097
That is the very simple idea
that governments should report

00:41:29.097 --> 00:41:32.320
to their citizens what revenues
they have.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:37.494
No sooner was it proposed than
reformers in Nigeria adopted it,

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:41.920
pushed it, and published the
revenues in the paper.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.376
Nigerian newspaper circulation
spiked, people wanted to know

00:41:45.376 --> 00:41:48.659
what their government was
getting in terms of revenue.

00:41:48.659 --> 00:41:50.909
We know it works.
 

00:41:50.909 --> 00:41:55.690
What would the content be of
these international standards?

00:41:55.690 --> 00:42:01.110
I can't go through all of them,
but I'll give you an example.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:05.840
The first is how to take the
resources out of the ground.

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:08.824
The economic process is taking
the resources out of the ground

00:42:08.824 --> 00:42:10.880
and putting assets on top of the
ground.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.713
The first step in that is
selling the rights to resource

00:42:14.713 --> 00:42:15.619
extraction.
 

00:42:15.619 --> 00:42:18.967
You know how rights to resource
extraction are being sold at the

00:42:18.967 --> 00:42:22.050
moment, how they've been sold
over the last forty years?

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:25.820
A company flies in,
does a deal with the minister,

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.806
and that's great for the
company and it's quite often

00:42:28.806 --> 00:42:32.668
great for the minister,
and it's not great for the

00:42:32.668 --> 00:42:33.489
country.
 

00:42:33.489 --> 00:42:37.126
There's a very simple
institutional technology which

00:42:37.126 --> 00:42:40.192
can transform that,
and it's called verified

00:42:40.192 --> 00:42:41.119
auctions.
 

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:49.730
The public agency with the
greatest expertise on earth is,

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:51.639
of course, the treasury,
that is the British Treasury,

00:42:51.639 --> 00:42:54.744
and the British Treasury
decided that it would sell the

00:42:54.744 --> 00:42:57.851
rights to third generation
mobile phones by working out

00:42:57.851 --> 00:42:59.750
what those rights were worth.
 

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.690
It worked out they were worth 2
billion pounds.

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.478
Just in time,
a set of economists got there

00:43:05.478 --> 00:43:08.199
and said, "Why not try an
auction?

00:43:08.199 --> 00:43:09.690
It'll reveal the value."
 

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:12.800
It went for 20 billion pounds
through auction.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.793
If the British Treasury can be
out by a factor of ten,

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:19.072
think what the ministry of
finance in Sierra Leone is going

00:43:19.072 --> 00:43:19.920
to be like.
 

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.010
When I put that out to the
president of Sierra Leone,

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:26.300
the next day he asked the World
Bank to send him a team to give

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.369
expertise on how to conduct
auctions.

00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:32.829
There are five such decision
points;

00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:35.409
each one needs an international
standard.

00:43:35.409 --> 00:43:40.650
If we could do it,
we would change the world.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:44.485
We would be helping the
reformers in these societies who

00:43:44.485 --> 00:43:46.440
are struggling for change.
 

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:49.070
That's our modest role.
 

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:52.632
We cannot change these
societies, but we can help the

00:43:52.632 --> 00:43:56.340
people in these societies,
who are struggling and usually

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.440
failing because the odds are so
stacked against them.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:05.579
Yet, we've not got these rules.
 

00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:09.173
If you think about it,
the cost of promulgating

00:44:09.173 --> 00:44:12.300
international rules is zilch,
nothing.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.500
Why on earth are they not there?
 

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:20.543
I realized that the reason
they're not there is that until

00:44:20.543 --> 00:44:25.322
we have a critical mass of
informed citizens in our own

00:44:25.322 --> 00:44:29.567
societies,
politicians will get away with

00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:33.501
gestures;
that unless we have an informed

00:44:33.501 --> 00:44:38.563
society what politicians do,
especially in relation to

00:44:38.563 --> 00:44:43.434
Africa, is gestures,
things that look good but don't

00:44:43.434 --> 00:44:44.389
work.
 

00:44:44.389 --> 00:44:48.724
So I realized we had to go
through the business of building

00:44:48.724 --> 00:44:50.518
an informed citizenry.
 

00:44:50.518 --> 00:44:54.018
That's why I broke all the
professional rules of conduct

00:44:54.018 --> 00:44:57.836
for an economist and I wrote an
economics book that you could

00:44:57.836 --> 00:44:59.110
read on a beach.
 

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:04.474
However, I have to say,
the process of communication

00:45:04.474 --> 00:45:10.784
does not come naturally to me,
this is why I'm on this stage,

00:45:10.784 --> 00:45:13.099
but it's alarming.
 

00:45:13.099 --> 00:45:18.760
I grew up in a culture of
self-effacement.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:26.199
My wife showed me a blog
comment on one of my last talks,

00:45:26.199 --> 00:45:30.550
and the blog comment said,
"Collier is not

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:35.668
charismatic,
but his arguments are

00:45:35.668 --> 00:45:38.840
compelling."
 

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:48.128
If you agree with that
sentiment and if you agree that

00:45:48.128 --> 00:45:56.014
we need a critical mass of
informed citizenry,

00:45:56.014 --> 00:46:02.500
you will realize that I need
you.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:05.150
Please become ambassadors.
 

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:11.619
Thank you.
 

00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:13.393
Jim Alexander:
 Professor Rae will be back

00:46:13.393 --> 00:46:14.800
on Wednesday and we'll see you
then.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:20.000

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.046
Prof: I'm going to talk
about some of my favorite people

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:05.430
today.
 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.120
Over the weekend I was at a
memorial service and a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.715
conference in honor of my late
mentor, the great historian and

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:16.050
sociologist, Charles Tilly.
 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.333
When I first knew him,
which was a long time ago,

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:22.070
he was working on collective
violence.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.380
He's someone in his career who
published literally fifty-one

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.049
books and over 600 articles,
but above all was a generous

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:31.530
mentor to a whole bunch of
people,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.510
including yours truly.
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.220
He was working on collective
violence.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.248
He once told me--in fact,
I couldn't find exactly where

00:00:41.248 --> 00:00:45.260
he wrote this,
if he did--he once told me,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.640
and I mentioned this the first
day,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.490
"It's bitter hard to write
the history of remainders."

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.221
Some of the people I'm going to
talk about today didn't see

00:00:57.221 --> 00:00:59.730
themselves as remainders in
history,

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.109
but they're people who didn't
quite fit in,

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:09.216
and were really overwhelmed and
ultimately defeated by the

00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:13.489
economic, social,
and political processes.

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:17.022
If one of the themes of the
course and of any course,

00:01:17.022 --> 00:01:20.269
really, I suppose,
that deals with the modern

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:23.867
world experience,
especially in this day of

00:01:23.867 --> 00:01:27.244
globalization,
is the dynamic duo of

00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:32.560
capitalism or large-scale
economic change and the state,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.539
you're going to see that today
in some of the folks that I'm

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:38.890
talking about.
 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.852
I once used the example of
trying to get you to imagine

00:01:43.852 --> 00:01:48.907
parachuting over the European
continent over a very slow

00:01:48.907 --> 00:01:50.010
descent.
 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.311
Let's say now from maybe
mid-sixteenth century until

00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.910
mid-nineteenth century.
 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.370
If you could see every incident
of collective violence,

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.976
of political protest,
popular protest that

00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:15.055
occurred--and all protest is
ultimately political--by far the

00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:20.020
most prevalent would have been
the grain riot.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.395
This itself is terribly
significant and so is its

00:02:24.395 --> 00:02:28.224
disappearance,
given what I just said about

00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:32.419
the state and large-scale
economic change.

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:38.044
Another way to imagine this is
if you had a Richter Scale that

00:02:38.044 --> 00:02:44.038
moved or that registered every
incident of collective violence.

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:48.056
Tilly and his whole team were
counting up every single

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:52.681
incident of collective violence
that they could find in Europe

00:02:52.681 --> 00:02:57.038
between mid-eighteenth century,
in terms of his study,

00:02:57.038 --> 00:02:59.889
or even earlier than that,
and 1936.

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:03.081
They would come to the same
conclusion that you would,

00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:06.576
were you floating over this
great continent for that period

00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:07.300
of time.
 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.167
What I'm going to do today is
sort of a trilogy,

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:13.280
talk about three things,
and they're all related.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.659
First, grain riots.
 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.810
Second the swing movement,
Captain Swing,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.348
drawing on the classic book a
long time ago of Eric Hobsbawm

00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:27.646
and George RudÃ©,
two truly great historians

00:03:27.646 --> 00:03:28.848
along with Tilly.
 

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:33.324
Third, talk about something
that I did, the Demoiselles of

00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:37.014
the AriÃ¨ge,
and I'll make that clear in a

00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:37.800
while.
 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.250
All three fit together,
I think, very nicely.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.710
One of the underlying themes,
which you'll see,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.072
is that popular protest and
collective violence attached to

00:03:51.072 --> 00:03:53.628
popular protest is not random.
 

00:03:53.628 --> 00:03:59.610
It can be spontaneous,
but it's not illogical.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.342
There's a logic to popular
protest right through the ages

00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:06.943
in the early-modern period as
well as in the nineteenth

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:10.954
century,
and ordinary people put forth

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:16.050
their demands by protesting and,
in doing so,

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.870
hope to affect change,
to appeal to authorities who

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.329
hopefully will do the right
thing,

00:04:23.329 --> 00:04:31.281
often imagining a world in the
past where a sense of justice

00:04:31.281 --> 00:04:32.899
prevailed.
 

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:36.971
In terms of grain riots I'll
talk about the just price,

00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:39.310
because they talked about it.
 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.089
Having said that,
let me enter the world of grain

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:47.220
riots.
 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.190
I'll give you some examples.
 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.824
This is from Spain,
1856, with the pretext of the

00:04:54.824 --> 00:04:58.079
high price of bread and for lack
of work.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:02.093
The workers of Valladolid and
Burgos rose and burned flour

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.910
stores, mills,
and inspection offices.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.848
The civil governor intervened
to put down the rising,

00:05:07.848 --> 00:05:11.238
but the rebels overwhelmed him
and attacked the chiefs of his

00:05:11.238 --> 00:05:11.860
forces.
 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.160
The sacking and burning
continued.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.930
Most likely,
as a consequence of the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.509
spreading of news of the
incident, disturbances also

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:21.040
spread to the countryside and to
other cities.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.711
The governor of Palencia tried
to hold back the uprising in his

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:27.850
city, but he had to retreat
before a hissing crowd.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.331
In Benavente,
Rioseco, and along the Castille

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:35.589
Canal, the disorders recurred.
 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:38.927
They had the characteristics of
the old type of rebellion aimed

00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:41.726
at spectators and hoarders,
among whom the masters of

00:05:41.726 --> 00:05:43.180
workshops were counted.
 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.848
In their hatred,
the insurgents set fire to

00:05:45.848 --> 00:05:48.629
shops and storehouses with the
cry of,

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:51.067
"cheap bread,
cheap bread,"

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:54.389
and attacked the boats that
served for the transport of

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:58.081
grain as well as putting the
torch to grain not yet harvested

00:05:58.081 --> 00:05:59.250
in the fields.
 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.550
If you back up almost a century
ago in France,

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.600
if you look at the memoirs of a
royal official from May 3,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.394
1775: "The musketeers,
who had been warned the day

00:06:14.394 --> 00:06:16.149
before,
hurried to the markets.

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:19.031
The fleeing rioters overturned
baskets full of bread and

00:06:19.031 --> 00:06:20.709
blocked the way to the horses.
 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:21.709
It was 9:00 a.m.
 

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.954
The watch was supposed to be
getting its orders at that hour

00:06:24.954 --> 00:06:28.199
and the people had already gone
to the bakers and seized the

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.069
bread they found in the shops.
 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.209
That pillage had a special
character.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:36.519
People did it without violence.
 

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:40.521
The shops of the bakers were
emptied and those of the pastry

00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:44.863
makers and the dealers and other
foods which were equally exposed

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.899
were left untouched."
 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:50.896
Or 1816 in England,
East Anglia:

00:06:50.896 --> 00:06:54.896
in early summer a surprise came
that the agricultural laborers

00:06:54.896 --> 00:06:58.964
(who we will come back to hear
about in a little while) of East

00:06:58.964 --> 00:07:01.259
Anglia had come out in revolt.
 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:06.740
Conditions had worsened since
the end of the Napoleonic war

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.220
and riots and disturbances were
everywhere in the towns.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:18.432
The point is that I could give
you examples from virtually

00:07:18.432 --> 00:07:24.754
every country over a very long
period of time and the grain

00:07:24.754 --> 00:07:27.370
riot would dominate.
 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.819
This is France-based,
but it's true of almost

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:32.326
everywhere--again,
do not write this down--men

00:07:32.326 --> 00:07:35.389
fight for food in the following
years particularly.

00:07:35.389 --> 00:07:38.894
They come in waves,
1693-94,1698,

00:07:38.894 --> 00:07:43.440
1709-10,
1728,1739-40,1749, 1752,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.021
1768,1770,
1775 a big one,

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:52.973
1785,1788-89,1793,
1799,1811-12,181

00:07:52.973 --> 00:08:00.259
6-17,1829-30,1839-40,
1846-47,1853-54,

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:03.079
and then never again.
 

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:06.930
By never again,
I mean in France never again

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:12.312
and slowly the grain riot
disappears as a form of

00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:16.839
political protest,
of collective violence or

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:20.500
collective nonviolence,
depending on the case.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.300
That's the big question.
 

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.910
What's going on here?
 

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.074
Popular protest is a way of
finding out what's going on when

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:30.629
you look at all this stuff.
 

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:33.942
Why do the grain riots
disappear as a form of

00:08:33.942 --> 00:08:35.600
collective violence?
 

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.048
Why?
 

00:08:37.048 --> 00:08:39.908
Here's a placard,
that is a poster,

00:08:39.908 --> 00:08:45.289
scrawled in the town of Vaville
in the West of France in 1709.

00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:46.860
"We are dying of hunger.
 

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.100
We must absolutely order you to
set prices on bread and grain or

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.870
else we will break from our
homes like enraged lions,

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.538
weapons in one hand,
fire in the other."

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:01.769
Arson--fire,
by the way, is one of those my

00:09:01.769 --> 00:09:06.000
friend, Jim Scott at Yale,
calls weapons of the weak.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.291
A match to a harvest or a roof
of a chaumiÃ¨re,

00:09:12.291 --> 00:09:17.730
a thatched cottage,
can do some serious mischief.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.774
What these grain rioters want
to do, very ordinary people,

00:09:21.774 --> 00:09:24.328
men and particularly
women--remember,

00:09:24.328 --> 00:09:28.019
women are responsible for the
household economy.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:30.500
Also young people and also
children.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.090
What they want to do is they're
putting forth claims.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:37.970
They want the government,
the monarchies,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.620
the administrators,
the officials,

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.538
the intendants,
the governors,

00:09:42.538 --> 00:09:48.500
the sheriffs in England to set
the price of bread,

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.600
as Maximilien Robespierre and
the Jacobins had wanted them to.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.750
Why?
 

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.899
To set the price of bread.
 

00:09:55.899 --> 00:10:01.461
To keep the price of bread low
so that everybody would have

00:10:01.461 --> 00:10:03.860
access to buying bread.
 

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.019
Bread--literally,
that commodity,

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:10.878
whether dark bread in the
poorer regions of central Europe

00:10:10.878 --> 00:10:14.804
or in the south of France or in
parts of Spain and southern

00:10:14.804 --> 00:10:16.399
Italy,
or white bread,

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:19.129
which is more associated with
more prosperous peasants,

00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:25.029
represented more than half of
the expenses of ordinary people,

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:27.080
not just food but bread.
 

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.110
Bread is what people ate.
 

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.904
Black bread in the poorer areas;
white bread in the wealthier

00:10:32.904 --> 00:10:35.220
areas, to make a generalization.
 

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.139
There were all different kinds
of bread.

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.769
Here's how I can approach this.
 

00:10:40.769 --> 00:10:44.139
In the town of Liege,
which is in Wallonia,

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:48.710
that is in what's now eastern
Belgium, Liege,

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.490
famous for its cork among other
things,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.440
and now part of the rust belt
of eastern Belgium,

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.259
they had a municipal statute,
that is a municipal regulation,

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:01.250
from about the fourteenth
century.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.580
The date 1317 sticks in my mind
somewhere.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.120
I must have read that decades
ago.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.142
It said that on market day
merchants from other places

00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:17.017
would not be allowed in to buy
grain until the third day of the

00:11:17.017 --> 00:11:18.058
market.
 

00:11:18.058 --> 00:11:21.461
By the way, the term for
merchants they used were

00:11:21.461 --> 00:11:24.933
engrosseurs,
which has a sense in French of

00:11:24.933 --> 00:11:28.620
a bunch of people who would make
themselves fat.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:29.418
Why?
 

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:32.471
Because they could afford to
buy bread at the price that

00:11:32.471 --> 00:11:33.970
nobody else could afford.
 

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.054
They wouldn't be allowed in
until the third day of the

00:11:37.054 --> 00:11:37.580
market.
 

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.774
But, of course,
that's not what happens through

00:11:40.774 --> 00:11:42.649
most of European history.
 

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:47.054
The pressure from these crowds,
the logic of these crowds is to

00:11:47.054 --> 00:11:51.394
force municipal authorities in
the name of order--but perhaps,

00:11:51.394 --> 00:11:54.553
who knows,
in the name of justice--to set

00:11:54.553 --> 00:11:58.447
a price of bread so that
everybody could have a shot at

00:11:58.447 --> 00:11:58.879
it.
 

00:11:58.879 --> 00:12:02.443
As some wag once put,
criticizing this kind of social

00:12:02.443 --> 00:12:05.827
history, "Well,
it's pretty obvious that grain

00:12:05.827 --> 00:12:10.291
riots occur on market days in
areas in which there is grain

00:12:10.291 --> 00:12:13.370
being exported out of a
region."

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:16.690
But that is precisely the point.
 

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:22.370
The peasants or townspeople
don't riot.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:26.118
Ordinary people don't riot
necessarily when the price of

00:12:26.118 --> 00:12:28.639
grain reaches its absolute
maximum.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:34.726
When they riot,
they seize grain or they

00:12:34.726 --> 00:12:38.599
pillage shops,
at the moment

00:12:38.599 --> 00:12:42.475
when--particularly when they see
grain being taken out of the

00:12:42.475 --> 00:12:47.024
community,
removed from their sense of

00:12:47.024 --> 00:12:55.529
moral authority over something
upon which they depend to live.

00:12:55.529 --> 00:12:58.943
Women, as I said before,
played the major role in grain

00:12:58.943 --> 00:12:59.450
riots.
 

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.240
Why?
 

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.230
Because they're responsible for
the household economy.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.658
Right through this whole period
there's a familiar scenario.

00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:11.590
People pour into town for
market day.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:15.505
They see the stagecoaches,
the diligences,

00:13:15.505 --> 00:13:19.830
the wagons carting the grain
away and they stop it.

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.289
They stop it.
 

00:13:21.289 --> 00:13:23.730
It's the same format everywhere.
 

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:26.163
It's as if you had some sort of
Internet, or CNN,

00:13:26.163 --> 00:13:29.105
or something like that telling
people, "Here's how you

00:13:29.105 --> 00:13:30.168
grain riot."
 

00:13:30.168 --> 00:13:33.674
But they don't rip off the
grain and they don't rip off,

00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:37.436
as the one example I gave you,
fancy pastries and stuff like

00:13:37.436 --> 00:13:38.009
that.
 

00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:45.270
They take the grain often to a
communal piece of property,

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:52.149
such as the commons or the
shed, the covered market.

00:13:52.149 --> 00:13:54.924
Some of the most fantastic
examples are in the south of

00:13:54.924 --> 00:13:56.928
France, but all sorts of places,
too.

00:13:56.928 --> 00:14:03.975
They sell the grain to ordinary
people at what they consider to

00:14:03.975 --> 00:14:06.250
be the just price.
 

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.509
They use that expression,
"the just price."

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:16.793
There's a sense of moral
outrage that some forces they

00:14:16.793 --> 00:14:23.668
can't control are taking away
what they need to survive.

00:14:23.668 --> 00:14:28.317
In 1789, a year you know,
what's the big collective

00:14:28.317 --> 00:14:29.990
action in Paris?
 

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.759
It's the seizing of the
Bastille, of course,

00:14:32.759 --> 00:14:37.538
but above all it's the attack
on the customs barriers,

00:14:37.538 --> 00:14:41.740
the tax offices that ring
Paris,

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.580
which forced the price of food,
grain, bread,

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.149
everything up higher.
 

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:53.263
They attacked them as a symbol
of what they considered to be an

00:14:53.263 --> 00:14:59.475
unfair economy that's depriving
them of the right to have enough

00:14:59.475 --> 00:15:00.558
to eat.
 

00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:05.125
So, these wagons that are
carrying grain away,

00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:07.558
who's in these wagons?
 

00:15:07.558 --> 00:15:09.899
Who are these folks and what
are they doing?

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:14.740
They're merchants and they know
that when they're buying up

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.580
grain, where are they taking it?
 

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.729
They're taking it to Berlin,
or Stuttgart,

00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:25.270
or Munich, or to Milan,
or to Paris,

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:26.789
or to Lyon.
 

00:15:26.789 --> 00:15:28.210
Why?
 

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.936
Because that grain will command
even a higher price there,

00:15:31.936 --> 00:15:34.288
where you've got all these
people.

00:15:34.288 --> 00:15:38.970
What is the interest of
monarchies and other forms of

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.038
tyranny, if you will?
 

00:15:41.038 --> 00:15:44.629
It's their interest to feed the
cities first.

00:15:44.629 --> 00:15:48.178
The growth of cities,
the growth of bureaucracies,

00:15:48.178 --> 00:15:52.765
of the state,
the growth of garrisons who

00:15:52.765 --> 00:16:00.230
have to be fed increases the
pressure on grain in times of

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.720
harvest failure.
 

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.303
Grain riots not only have the
timing of markets when grain is

00:16:06.303 --> 00:16:09.826
leaving the town,
but obviously the subtext is

00:16:09.826 --> 00:16:13.980
that in times of these cyclical
harvest failures.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.460
The harvest fails.
 

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.120
Credit is withdrawn.
 

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.080
The price of bread goes up and
the riots start.

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.357
If you look at where the riots
start in any of these countries

00:16:23.357 --> 00:16:27.216
that I've talked about,
it's in response to grain being

00:16:27.216 --> 00:16:32.616
taken out of rural regions and
being taken to cities to get

00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:34.200
higher prices.
 

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.062
You've got the merchant on the
wagon, too, and you've probably

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:37.860
got his driver.
 

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.500
Who else do you have there,
increasingly?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:45.210
You've got the Guarda Civila in
Spain,

00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:50.370
or you've got various police in
the Italian estates,

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:53.769
or you've got the tough,
hardened Berlin police,

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:57.538
or the Prussian army,
or you've got the

00:16:57.538 --> 00:16:58.892
gendarmes or the
marÃ©ch

00:16:58.892 --> 00:17:01.270
aussÃ©e,
as they called them in the

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.984
eighteenth century,
or the gendarmes in the

00:17:03.984 --> 00:17:04.858
nineteenth century.
 

00:17:04.858 --> 00:17:08.348
Here again is a way of looking
at this theme.

00:17:08.348 --> 00:17:13.009
The state and capitalism are on
the wagon here.

00:17:13.009 --> 00:17:17.217
You've got the merchant and
you've got the police guarding

00:17:17.217 --> 00:17:17.660
him.
 

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:23.730
That's the dynamic duo of
change over the long run.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:30.390
To be sure, people who have big
plots of land in Pomerania,

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:35.517
or in northern Italy,
or in the Beauce south of

00:17:35.517 --> 00:17:37.519
Paris,
around Chartres,

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:42.152
or someplace like that,
these people are not out grain

00:17:42.152 --> 00:17:43.170
rioting.
 

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.119
What are they doing?
 

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:45.160
They're hoarding.
 

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.759
They're waiting until the price
of grain even goes higher.

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:52.248
That's why a form of popular
protest, of collective action

00:17:52.248 --> 00:17:56.578
throughout this whole period are
attacks on hoarders.

00:17:56.578 --> 00:17:58.450
1789--you read about it in the
book.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.201
The famine plot,
the idea that wealthy

00:18:02.201 --> 00:18:05.866
aristocrats are trying to starve
out the poor to get their way

00:18:05.866 --> 00:18:10.309
and that hoarders have huge,
just sacks of grain,

00:18:10.309 --> 00:18:14.960
which they often did,
in their chateaus.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.886
They're holding it from the
market and laissez faire says,

00:18:17.886 --> 00:18:20.250
"Let the market decide the
price."

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.289
"Okay, let's keep that
stuff back.

00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:23.069
People will go hungry.
 

00:18:23.069 --> 00:18:24.328
Too damn bad for them.
 

00:18:24.328 --> 00:18:26.769
They should have more
money."

00:18:26.769 --> 00:18:32.730
Over and over and over again in
all of these places the grain

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:38.095
riot is the most important form
of collective violence,

00:18:38.095 --> 00:18:40.380
of popular protest.
 

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.910
Then it just disappears.
 

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.005
Again, France is the most
studied, but it disappears

00:18:47.005 --> 00:18:48.279
earlier in Britain.
 

00:18:48.279 --> 00:18:49.390
You'll know why already.
 

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.470
You already know.
 

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.420
I'll tell you again in a minute.
 

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.740
There ain't no peasants left in
Britain.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.170
In France, the last wave is
1855.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.644
Now, there are protests at the
end of the nineteenth century

00:19:02.644 --> 00:19:04.528
against the high cost of food.
 

00:19:04.528 --> 00:19:09.705
One shouldn't imagine people
surrounding the Stop N Shop and

00:19:09.705 --> 00:19:14.883
blocking it with their little
pushcarts that they're putting

00:19:14.883 --> 00:19:19.123
their frozen food into,
but they're the equivalents of

00:19:19.123 --> 00:19:19.480
that.
 

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.710
There are protests against the
high cost of food.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.410
Food still is an important
dynamic in protests.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.663
In World War II,
for example,

00:19:27.663 --> 00:19:31.928
irritation about the rich doing
even better than ever,

00:19:31.928 --> 00:19:35.630
and rationing cards and all
that business.

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:41.195
But the grain riot simply
disappears as a form of popular

00:19:41.195 --> 00:19:43.980
protest in Europe,
period.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.393
It doesn't mean that bread
wouldn't be terribly important

00:19:46.393 --> 00:19:47.599
in the Russian Revolution.
 

00:19:47.599 --> 00:19:48.538
It does.
 

00:19:48.538 --> 00:19:55.960
There are riots in Russia
against the high price of bread.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:01.356
But the classic beginning in
Western Europe and moving east,

00:20:01.356 --> 00:20:05.896
the classic,
the quintessentially popular

00:20:05.896 --> 00:20:10.226
domain of protest,
expression of popular protest

00:20:10.226 --> 00:20:12.079
just disappears,
period,

00:20:12.079 --> 00:20:13.819
point.
 

00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:15.730
Why?
 

00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:17.990
The battle's been won.
 

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:21.060
The merchants,
the police, the

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.720
gendarmes,
the troops, they're already

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.778
there.
 

00:20:26.778 --> 00:20:31.826
Beginning again west to Eastern
Europe, you've got the

00:20:31.826 --> 00:20:37.920
depopulation of marginal rural
property, marginal rural lands.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.823
People can't make it anymore
producing little bits of this

00:20:43.823 --> 00:20:48.277
and that and they plunge
themselves into the

00:20:48.277 --> 00:20:53.868
ever-increasing urban world in
order to find work.

00:20:53.868 --> 00:20:57.034
And, so, if you look at what
people protest over,

00:20:57.034 --> 00:20:59.538
we can see this big economic
change.

00:20:59.538 --> 00:21:02.569
The nineteenth century just
transforms the way people live.

00:21:02.569 --> 00:21:03.269
This is for sure.
 

00:21:03.269 --> 00:21:05.720
The nineteenth century didn't
invent consumer culture.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.194
We already know,
Jan deVries has just published

00:21:08.194 --> 00:21:11.738
within the last month or two
just a brilliant book showing

00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:15.469
that ordinary families made all
sorts of sacrifices to try to

00:21:15.469 --> 00:21:19.075
improve their lives beginning
the middle of the seventeenth

00:21:19.075 --> 00:21:21.743
century,
participating in this consumer

00:21:21.743 --> 00:21:23.809
culture, buying soap,
buying forks,

00:21:23.809 --> 00:21:25.470
and that kind of thing.
 

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.374
But these big-time economic
changes, the nineteenth century

00:21:29.374 --> 00:21:32.269
is the crucial period in the
whole thing.

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:38.329
The disappearance of the grain
riot as a form of popular

00:21:38.329 --> 00:21:44.058
protest is a fantastic
demonstration of that fact.

00:21:44.058 --> 00:21:46.972
You don't want to complicate
the thing or undermine the

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.940
validity of what I've said by
imagining, "Well,

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.960
that's all pre-modern,
this kind of protest.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.188
Then we've got modern protest
and more strikes and all

00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:55.980
that."
 

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:58.548
It's true that there are more
strikes and strikes become

00:21:58.548 --> 00:22:00.650
another classic form of
political protest,

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.130
but the world of the nineteenth
century was changing.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:08.586
The big losers in all of this
are rural people,

00:22:08.586 --> 00:22:12.751
rural laborers,
peasants who simply couldn't

00:22:12.751 --> 00:22:17.789
make a go of it and their world
was transformed.

00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:21.710
That's part one of this trilogy.
 

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:26.118
Secondly, let's look at the
Swing Movement.

00:22:26.118 --> 00:22:31.423
These next two things I'm going
to talk about take place really

00:22:31.423 --> 00:22:33.049
at the same time.
 

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:35.509
That's not a coincidence.
 

00:22:35.509 --> 00:22:37.318
It's not a coincidence at all.
 

00:22:37.318 --> 00:22:39.538
The first story is that of
Captain Swing.

00:22:39.538 --> 00:22:43.500
I alluded to this the very
first day, those of you who were

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:43.980
here.
 

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:48.500
It was in 1829-30.
 

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.380
Those are the big years.
 

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:54.538
The Demoiselles of the
AriÃ¨ge comes at just the

00:22:54.538 --> 00:22:55.480
same time.
 

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.359
They are similar and
fascinating.

00:22:57.359 --> 00:22:58.329
I think they're fascinating.
 

00:22:58.329 --> 00:23:00.150
I hope you will, too.
 

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:03.000
They have so much in common
with each other and with what

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.578
I've just been talking about.
 

00:23:04.578 --> 00:23:10.463
It's not about winners and
losers in the brave new economy

00:23:10.463 --> 00:23:16.760
of high-powered capitalism and
all its incarnations in Europe,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.618
big and small.
 

00:23:18.618 --> 00:23:23.804
We see the faces,
the remainders of this kind of

00:23:23.804 --> 00:23:25.788
economic change.
 

00:23:25.788 --> 00:23:32.808
Again, the people who worked on
Captain Swing were George

00:23:32.808 --> 00:23:36.819
RudÃ© and Eric Hobsbawm.
 

00:23:36.819 --> 00:23:39.660
How do I put this?
 

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:47.976
There was a real person called
Ned Ludd in about 1816-17 in

00:23:47.976 --> 00:23:49.410
England.
 

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.940
The English word Luddite is
someone who's a machine breaker.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.950
Luddism is machine breaking.
 

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:01.215
You break machines because
machines are putting you out of

00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:01.740
work.
 

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.828
You're a handloom weaver.
 

00:24:03.828 --> 00:24:06.788
There are famous cases in
Silesia in Germany.

00:24:06.788 --> 00:24:10.595
Then machines for glassworks
and then later in the century,

00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:14.269
things I talked about last
time, were putting them out of

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.859
work.
 

00:24:14.859 --> 00:24:18.180
Ned Ludd busted up machines.
 

00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:21.990
He broke machines.
 

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:26.910
1829 was an awful economic year
everywhere in Europe.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:32.250
A freezing winter and real
hunger in Britain.

00:24:32.250 --> 00:24:33.308
That's my example.
 

00:24:33.308 --> 00:24:35.569
It's from Britain,
from England specifically,

00:24:35.569 --> 00:24:38.190
from the south of England even
more specifically.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:42.527
They found people who were
starved to death in the fields

00:24:42.527 --> 00:24:47.019
with only dandelions in their
stomachs with nothing else to

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:47.640
eat.
 

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.740
If you were a Frenchman,
or a German,

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:59.057
or a northern Italian,
and you went to England in 1829

00:24:59.057 --> 00:25:01.881
or 1830,
if you did the reverse of the

00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:04.655
Arthur Young track--Arthur Young
was always wandering through

00:25:04.655 --> 00:25:07.337
France and discovering people he
thought were sixty-five or

00:25:07.337 --> 00:25:07.940
seventy.
 

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.019
It turned out they were
twenty-nine.

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:13.259
They were so battered and
beaten down by hardship.

00:25:13.259 --> 00:25:17.434
There's famous case of a woman
he met in Champagne near Reims

00:25:17.434 --> 00:25:18.480
of that case.
 

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.406
Arthur Young saw all of these
peasants in Europe,

00:25:22.406 --> 00:25:27.397
but the counterpart of Arthur
Young, people from the continent

00:25:27.397 --> 00:25:30.180
going to England,
were amazed.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:34.460
There weren't any more
peasants, virtually no peasants.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.592
You'd find a peasant as a small
property owner existentially

00:25:37.592 --> 00:25:40.181
committed to the land,
that's a little bit overly

00:25:40.181 --> 00:25:43.219
fancy,
but dependent upon a lopin

00:25:43.219 --> 00:25:46.920
de terre,
a small piece of land,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.848
for family survival,
the household economy.

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:52.930
There weren't any more peasants
left in England.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.940
There were gentry,
including big property owners

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.078
who were masters of all that
they saw before them,

00:25:59.078 --> 00:26:02.410
in the portraits they had
painted of themselves.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.848
You had gentry.
 

00:26:03.848 --> 00:26:08.788
You had yeomen who were sort of
smaller versions of gentry.

00:26:08.788 --> 00:26:13.868
You had middle-rank property
owners and this sort of thing.

00:26:13.868 --> 00:26:16.778
You had wealthy people from the
city wanting to live in an

00:26:16.778 --> 00:26:19.740
aristocratic way buying as much
land as they could take.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.752
There was no place in Europe in
which such a small percentage of

00:26:22.752 --> 00:26:24.808
the population owned so much of
the land.

00:26:24.808 --> 00:26:29.309
That's still true today in
Britain.

00:26:29.309 --> 00:26:31.160
But there weren't any peasants.
 

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:31.740
Why?
 

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.490
Because the big fish had eaten
the smaller fish.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:37.049
And because,
beginning in the sixteenth

00:26:37.049 --> 00:26:39.259
century,
the enclosure movement,

00:26:39.259 --> 00:26:41.019
which you've read about,
I think,

00:26:41.019 --> 00:26:45.130
meant that basically,
no surprise,

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.618
the big guys get the law on
their side.

00:26:47.618 --> 00:26:52.323
Parliament passes thousands of
acts of enclosure which allow

00:26:52.323 --> 00:26:56.308
people to enclose and divide up
the common land.

00:26:56.308 --> 00:27:01.009
The big fish eat the smaller
fish and the peasantry is

00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:02.960
basically destroyed.
 

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.768
What you have,
as I said before in another

00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:06.797
context, in England,
is you've got all sorts of

00:27:06.797 --> 00:27:07.680
textile workers.
 

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.519
You've got all sorts of
governesses and domestic

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:15.034
workers, and you have hundreds
of thousands,

00:27:15.034 --> 00:27:18.140
millions of agricultural
laborers.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.759
You have agricultural laborers
in other countries,

00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:21.078
too.
 

00:27:21.078 --> 00:27:23.420
But you also have small
property owners.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.578
There's hardly any of those
folks left in England.

00:27:25.578 --> 00:27:31.932
To return to the story,
in 1829 ordinary people start

00:27:31.932 --> 00:27:37.920
participating in protest and
collective action.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.338
They start threatening,
and smashing,

00:27:42.338 --> 00:27:46.390
and burning threshing machines.
 

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.548
Why threshing machines?
 

00:27:48.548 --> 00:27:52.358
Because threshing machines are
taking their work.

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:55.170
The way they survive is during
harvest they go from place to

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.740
place working,
the way people still do in the

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.970
wine harvest in the south of
France,

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.450
working from place to place
bringing in the harvest,

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.130
prosperous agricultural land in
the south of England.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:07.430
This is how they get by.
 

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.858
They don't live very well.
 

00:28:08.858 --> 00:28:09.990
They don't do very well,
but they're lodged.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.890
They're fed.
 

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.140
They have a crummy place to
sleep, but they can do okay.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:19.094
Then the big guys,
the big farmers start buying

00:28:19.094 --> 00:28:20.900
threshing machines.
 

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.920
The threshing machines do the
work of these people.

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.236
Next time they guys come along
in groups of ten,

00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:28.354
twenty, thirty,
families, pals,

00:28:28.354 --> 00:28:32.799
friends, they come around and
say, "It's harvest time.

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:35.740
Here we are.
 

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.000
Nous voilÃ ."
 

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.700
"Sorry, ol' chap.
 

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.259
We don't need you.
 

00:28:41.259 --> 00:28:43.410
Maybe a couple of you,
but we don't need you.

00:28:43.410 --> 00:28:45.440
We've got these machines.
 

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.450
They do the job that you used
to do.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.088
We don't have a problem with
them working hard all the time.

00:28:51.088 --> 00:28:54.259
The machines work all the time
at our command.

00:28:54.259 --> 00:28:56.950
See ya!"
 

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:58.539
Are they mad?
 

00:28:58.539 --> 00:28:59.740
They're furious.
 

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.348
They start burning these
machines.

00:29:02.348 --> 00:29:06.153
They start smashing down the
gates and going in and burning

00:29:06.153 --> 00:29:07.269
these machines.
 

00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:12.417
Then they started to find
posters that had been written,

00:29:12.417 --> 00:29:16.442
scrawled posters,
sometimes barely literate,

00:29:16.442 --> 00:29:20.750
because this wasn't a literate
population.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.811
They begin to talk about a
mythical-like figure like Ned

00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:27.618
Ludd, except this wasn't a real
one.

00:29:27.618 --> 00:29:31.278
My favorite--I had this former
girlfriend a long time ago at

00:29:31.278 --> 00:29:34.007
Mighty Michigan,
and we were going to write a

00:29:34.007 --> 00:29:35.619
screenplay about this.
 

00:29:35.619 --> 00:29:38.358
We never did.
 

00:29:38.358 --> 00:29:40.686
One of them said,
they all said,

00:29:40.686 --> 00:29:44.517
"If you don't get rid of
the threshing machine,

00:29:44.517 --> 00:29:46.470
your agony will begin.
 

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.049
We will destroy your machines.
 

00:29:49.049 --> 00:29:50.650
We will burn you out."
 

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:57.314
But the best that I ever saw
was, "Revenge for thee is

00:29:57.314 --> 00:30:03.519
on the wing from thy determined
Captain Swing."

00:30:03.519 --> 00:30:06.068
Who was Captain Swing?
 

00:30:06.068 --> 00:30:08.740
He was a sense of popular
justice.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.849
He was what used to be called
the moral economy.

00:30:12.849 --> 00:30:14.869
He did not exist.
 

00:30:14.869 --> 00:30:15.589
He should have.
 

00:30:15.589 --> 00:30:19.089
He still should exist.
 

00:30:19.089 --> 00:30:20.920
He did not exist.
 

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.715
But Captain Swing gave this
kind of paramilitary sense to

00:30:25.715 --> 00:30:27.430
"We are many.
 

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.069
We are correct.
 

00:30:29.069 --> 00:30:30.140
We are right.
 

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.710
We have God on our side.
 

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.420
We are organized.
 

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:36.710
We will win."
 

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:40.700
The subtext is that "Maybe
we better negotiate and see.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.599
Maybe you keep a few machines
around, but we want our jobs

00:30:44.599 --> 00:30:45.490
back."
 

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.660
Captain Swing was everywhere.
 

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.619
He was in Kent.
 

00:30:50.619 --> 00:30:52.089
He was in Cambridgeshire.
 

00:30:52.089 --> 00:30:53.079
He was in Devon.
 

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:54.828
He was in Wiltshire.
 

00:30:54.828 --> 00:30:58.865
He didn't exist,
but he was everywhere,

00:30:58.865 --> 00:31:02.900
at least in the popular
imagination.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.970
By the way, the Captain Swing
folks had some allies.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:12.349
They were the smaller farmers
who couldn't afford the big-time

00:31:12.349 --> 00:31:14.769
threshing machines,
and they thought,

00:31:14.769 --> 00:31:18.946
"Maybe if they burn the
machines of my ravenous

00:31:18.946 --> 00:31:20.884
neighbor,
that wouldn't be the worst

00:31:20.884 --> 00:31:21.838
thing in the world."
 

00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:26.039
So, they get moral support from
folks like that.

00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:27.599
They spread.
 

00:31:27.599 --> 00:31:30.759
They're in all sorts of places.
 

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:32.089
Do they win?
 

00:31:32.089 --> 00:31:34.069
Are you kidding?
 

00:31:34.069 --> 00:31:35.920
They lose.
 

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.165
The sheriff comes in a country
that only had a police force

00:31:40.165 --> 00:31:44.192
starting in 1829 in London,
that didn't like the idea of

00:31:44.192 --> 00:31:45.730
uniformed armies.
 

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:49.608
That was something the French
and the Spanish had.

00:31:49.608 --> 00:31:53.910
They bring their military
contingents and they beat the

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:56.059
hell out of these people.
 

00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:58.108
They put them on trial.
 

00:31:58.108 --> 00:32:02.140
They hang some of them,
not all that many.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:08.578
They sent lots of them to
Tasmania or to Australia.

00:32:08.578 --> 00:32:10.926
"We all live in a convict
colony,"

00:32:10.926 --> 00:32:14.038
as they sometimes sing in
Australia whenever they play the

00:32:14.038 --> 00:32:16.384
"poms,"
as they sometimes call the

00:32:16.384 --> 00:32:17.150
British.
 

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:21.019
They send them a long,
long way and they defeat them.

00:32:21.019 --> 00:32:23.279
It's bitter hard to write the
history of remainders.

00:32:23.279 --> 00:32:24.880
It's fun, though, too.
 

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.640
It's fun.
 

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.680
Captain Swing disappears.
 

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.420
The big guys win.
 

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.368
Enclosure keeps rolling along.
 

00:32:38.368 --> 00:32:40.829
Tens of thousands of people are
on the road.

00:32:40.829 --> 00:32:42.690
Oh, they get a little victory.
 

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:48.026
The poor law of 1832 was
probably influenced by this

00:32:48.026 --> 00:32:54.410
perceived threat of popular
people voting with their feet,

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.930
threatening but also
negotiating, cajoling,

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:02.946
trying to imagine a time in the
past when everybody had a shot

00:33:02.946 --> 00:33:04.838
at doing well enough.
 

00:33:04.838 --> 00:33:08.823
The same thing as the grain
riots, imagining a time when

00:33:08.823 --> 00:33:11.720
there was a just price for
everything.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:14.740
Captain Swing was really part
of that.

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.361
Obviously, I find what they did
thrilling, but I probably

00:33:18.361 --> 00:33:19.720
shouldn't say that.
 

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:24.653
And, of course,
they probably had a lot of time

00:33:24.653 --> 00:33:28.653
to think about what they did on
that extraordinarily long trip

00:33:28.653 --> 00:33:31.318
to Port Arthur,
not the Port Arthur in Asia,

00:33:31.318 --> 00:33:35.058
but the Port Arthur in
Tasmania,

00:33:35.058 --> 00:33:40.049
or to what would become New
South Wales or Victoria in

00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:41.180
Australia.
 

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.348
But Captain Swing disappears.
 

00:33:44.348 --> 00:33:48.779
He never existed,
but he sure should have.

00:33:48.779 --> 00:33:54.660
A long time ago,
when I was starting out,

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:59.544
I was working in the archives
in Vincennes on the edge of

00:33:59.544 --> 00:34:01.833
Paris,
the military archives in the

00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:03.230
big Chateau de Vincennes.
 

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:08.353
I was working on other stuff
and I kept finding these

00:34:08.353 --> 00:34:14.070
incidents that were occurring at
precisely the same time as

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.829
Captain Swing,
1829-30,

00:34:16.829 --> 00:34:19.340
not in England but in France.
 

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:29.630
I kept finding these reports
from a part of--;I didn't bring

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:37.480
a map and I can't draw worth a
damn either.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.550
Imagine la belle France.
 

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.050
Nice, huh?
 

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:46.170
Mountains.
 

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.260
Toulouse here.
 

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.570
Bordeaux down here,
voilÃ .

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.077
I kept finding in a department
called the AriÃ¨ge,

00:34:56.077 --> 00:34:59.840
the mountainous department,
I kept finding these reports.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.300
The capital is Foix,
but that's in the plain,

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:02.860
kind of.
 

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.360
Then you go up in the mountains.
 

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.750
You've got real serious
mountains.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:08.059
Now people drive through those
mountains to get to Andorra,

00:35:08.059 --> 00:35:09.534
to buy cheaper pastis,
and cigarettes,

00:35:09.534 --> 00:35:10.610
and that kind of thing.
 

00:35:10.610 --> 00:35:12.030
It's very beautiful there.
 

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.019
It's also full now of people
from 1968 who went off and

00:35:15.019 --> 00:35:17.179
formed communes in the
AriÃ¨ge.

00:35:17.179 --> 00:35:19.559
Sometimes you'll see some of
them staggering around there.

00:35:19.559 --> 00:35:24.123
I kept finding reports from the
police or from the

00:35:24.123 --> 00:35:27.010
gendarmes,
above all,

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:33.911
or from mayors saying that men
dressed as women were coming

00:35:33.911 --> 00:35:40.219
down the mountain in the mists,
and fog, and snow,

00:35:40.219 --> 00:35:44.860
armed with pitchforks,
armed with rifles and were

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:50.739
chasing away two groups of
people: charbonniers,

00:35:50.739 --> 00:35:56.981
charcoal burners--forest people
cutting down trees--and forest

00:35:56.981 --> 00:36:02.713
guards--those people guarding
the forests employed by the

00:36:02.713 --> 00:36:04.992
state,
employed by the rural

00:36:04.992 --> 00:36:07.465
bourgeoisie,
or people living in Foix or

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:10.559
Toulouse who owned a lot of land
in the forest,

00:36:10.559 --> 00:36:18.407
or by communes if the forests
were communally owned to try to

00:36:18.407 --> 00:36:21.940
keep out ordinary people.
 

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.657
These people were coming down
the mountain and taking shots at

00:36:26.657 --> 00:36:29.829
them and yelling nasty things to
them,

00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:34.039
threatening them with
pitchforks and trying to drive

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:35.030
them away.
 

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:39.512
And then, they would find notes
saying, "If the forest

00:36:39.512 --> 00:36:43.916
guards and the charcoal burners
come back, your agony will

00:36:43.916 --> 00:36:44.690
begin.
 

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.731
Signed Jean,
Lieutenant of the

00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:49.829
Demoiselles."
 

00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:55.880
A demoiselle in French is
obviously a young woman.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.898
These became known as the
Demoiselles of the

00:36:57.898 --> 00:36:58.650
AriÃ¨ge.
 

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:05.025
I found so many of these in
1829,1830, 1831,

00:37:05.025 --> 00:37:09.623
a few in 1848,
a couple in 1872,

00:37:09.623 --> 00:37:12.590
and never again.
 

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:15.380
Who were these people and what
were they doing?

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:18.193
What they wanted,
again think of Captain Swing

00:37:18.193 --> 00:37:21.882
and think of the grain riots,
what they wanted was access to

00:37:21.882 --> 00:37:22.820
the forest.
 

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.530
They'd always had access to the
forest.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.800
It's cold in the AriÃ¨ge.
 

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.175
You need wood that's gleaned
from the forest to make fire to

00:37:32.175 --> 00:37:33.139
stay alive.
 

00:37:33.139 --> 00:37:36.360
You need berries, roots to eat.
 

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.090
You need places to pasture your
animals,

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.929
pigs which eat right down
through the root,

00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:49.835
goats like we have in our
village in ArdÃ¨che,

00:37:49.835 --> 00:37:51.110
or sheep.
 

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.559
If they're really rich maybe
cows, but that didn't happen

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:55.670
very much there.
 

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:57.199
The rich guys owned the cows.
 

00:37:57.199 --> 00:37:59.289
The peasants didn't own the
cows.

00:37:59.289 --> 00:38:02.458
They'd always,
for centuries as they well

00:38:02.458 --> 00:38:05.550
remembered, had access to the
forest.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.030
Why did they lose access to the
forests?

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:10.030
They're looking back at an
imaginary time.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.139
It wasn't imaginary.
 

00:38:11.139 --> 00:38:12.360
They always had had access.
 

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.780
There was lots of forest--the
whole place.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.545
Deforestation is a big problem
in France since the seventeenth

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:18.679
and eighteenth century.
 

00:38:18.679 --> 00:38:21.579
But the Pyrenees have many
forests, many mountains.

00:38:21.579 --> 00:38:24.420
They'd always been able to go
there as they wanted.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:28.577
They didn't own the forest,
but use and property were not

00:38:28.577 --> 00:38:31.768
categories that meant anything
to anyone.

00:38:31.768 --> 00:38:33.530
They're told they can't go
there anymore.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:36.804
Some of them go to churches and
they're looking for deeds that

00:38:36.804 --> 00:38:40.027
would have given people of those
villages rights to be in the

00:38:40.027 --> 00:38:41.369
forest centuries ago.
 

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:42.239
No.
 

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:44.389
They don't find them.
 

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:47.447
So, why can't they go in the
forest anymore to pasture their

00:38:47.447 --> 00:38:50.610
miserable animals or to find
something to eat or some fuel?

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.159
Why can't they do that anymore?
 

00:38:52.159 --> 00:38:53.820
Aha!
 

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:57.010
We're talking capitalism in the
state.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:58.599
The price of wood has increased.
 

00:38:58.599 --> 00:38:59.510
Why?
 

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:03.831
The metallurgical industry,
what they call Catalan,

00:39:03.831 --> 00:39:07.463
as in Catalonia,
forges small metallurgical

00:39:07.463 --> 00:39:08.760
industries.
 

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.059
The price of wood goes up.
 

00:39:10.059 --> 00:39:12.300
Suddenly the people that own
the forest say,

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.809
"Hey baby,
we don't want those peasants

00:39:14.809 --> 00:39:17.610
and their animals in the forest
anymore."

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.518
They start hiring forest guards.
 

00:39:20.518 --> 00:39:23.929
They start hiring charcoal
burners,

00:39:23.929 --> 00:39:26.601
the charbonniers,
who are chopping down the

00:39:26.601 --> 00:39:28.510
trees,
slicing them up,

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:31.639
as people still do in the Jura,
or in the Black Forest,

00:39:31.639 --> 00:39:34.400
or do anywhere that you can
think of in Europe.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:40.306
In Oregon, where I'm from,
logging was a good way to make

00:39:40.306 --> 00:39:41.150
money.
 

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:43.389
I never did it,
but when you're in college.

00:39:43.389 --> 00:39:45.650
And, so, the wood is leaving
the forests.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.132
People are getting even richer
and the peasants are out of

00:39:49.132 --> 00:39:49.559
luck.
 

00:39:49.559 --> 00:39:51.110
Why are they out of luck?
 

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.802
Because what the big-money
people do that own the forest is

00:39:54.802 --> 00:39:57.795
they do exactly what the wealthy
did in England,

00:39:57.795 --> 00:39:59.260
the big landowners.
 

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.429
They get the law on their side.
 

00:40:00.429 --> 00:40:01.849
What a surprise.
 

00:40:01.849 --> 00:40:03.789
They have their lobbyists.
 

00:40:03.789 --> 00:40:04.929
They get the law on their side.
 

00:40:04.929 --> 00:40:11.070
They pass a new forest code in
1827 that keeps ordinary people

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:16.809
out of the forests to which they
had always had access.

00:40:16.809 --> 00:40:18.360
They always had access.
 

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.849
They can't go there anymore.
 

00:40:19.849 --> 00:40:23.619
They go up there and they find
armed guards there.

00:40:23.619 --> 00:40:28.579
They are many and the guards
are few and they scare the hell

00:40:28.579 --> 00:40:31.860
out of them and they drive them
away.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.788
The mayors of these little
villages, Massat--I love to go

00:40:35.788 --> 00:40:36.349
there.
 

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:38.130
I've written about it.
 

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:39.449
Massat was one of the mayors.
 

00:40:39.449 --> 00:40:40.670
He's in a difficult position.
 

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.106
He knows damn well who is
causing the troubles,

00:40:43.106 --> 00:40:44.960
les troubles,
in the forests,

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.239
but he's got to live with these
people.

00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:50.429
He isn't going to be telling on
anybody.

00:40:50.429 --> 00:40:51.610
I followed this through.
 

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:56.811
I read this and wrote something
about it in a book I did a long

00:40:56.811 --> 00:41:01.510
time ago called 1830 in
France, an edited book.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:05.619
So, what happens?
 

00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:08.530
Who is Jeanne,
Lieutenant of the Demoiselles?

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:09.289
Jeanne.
 

00:41:09.289 --> 00:41:10.289
Who is she?
 

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:12.349
She didn't exist either.
 

00:41:12.349 --> 00:41:14.880
She's exactly like Captain
Swing.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.039
She says, "We are many.
 

00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:18.539
We are right.
 

00:41:18.539 --> 00:41:21.400
We have justice on our
side."

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.889
By the way, these people did
not speak French.

00:41:23.889 --> 00:41:26.945
It was hard for them to find
somebody to write in French

00:41:26.945 --> 00:41:29.835
"Your agony will
begin," because they don't

00:41:29.835 --> 00:41:30.780
speak French.
 

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.068
They spoke a patois that's very
much influenced by Spanish

00:41:35.068 --> 00:41:39.510
that's not even really like
Catalan and certainly nothing to

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:40.940
do with Basque.
 

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.547
It doesn't have anything to do
with anything except vaguely

00:41:44.547 --> 00:41:46.039
Hungarian and Finnish.
 

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:48.951
They write these things and
they said that Jeanne,

00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:51.981
the Lieutenant of the
Demoiselles will toast you one

00:41:51.981 --> 00:41:54.300
day if you don't leave the
forests.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:57.608
What they want is they want the
government to restore their

00:41:57.608 --> 00:41:58.920
rights in the forest.
 

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.010
Does the government do that?
 

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:00.719
Are you kidding?
 

00:42:00.719 --> 00:42:01.969
Of course they don't.
 

00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:04.454
Now, 1830 comes along,
"revolution,

00:42:04.454 --> 00:42:06.621
liberty, fraternity,
equality, red,

00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:08.280
white, and blue."
 

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.099
What do they do?
 

00:42:09.099 --> 00:42:11.996
They say, "Well,
this liberty must mean that we

00:42:11.996 --> 00:42:14.610
can have our forests back,
doesn't it?"

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:18.318
One of the interesting things
about this is they become

00:42:18.318 --> 00:42:20.789
petitioners just for a little
bit.

00:42:20.789 --> 00:42:23.284
They get people who can write
French to petition saying,

00:42:23.284 --> 00:42:25.280
"We hear about this
liberty in Paris.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.059
That surely is our forests,
isn't it?"

00:42:28.059 --> 00:42:28.909
Un-uh.
 

00:42:28.909 --> 00:42:30.449
The government says,
"Oh, no.

00:42:30.449 --> 00:42:34.255
The Forest Code of 1827 is
evermore in use and you can't

00:42:34.255 --> 00:42:36.610
have access to the forest."
 

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:39.260
The forest guards return.
 

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:43.695
The forest guards return to the
forest, but so do the

00:42:43.695 --> 00:42:44.889
demoiselles.
 

00:42:44.889 --> 00:42:48.639
They begin to dress up as women
again.

00:42:48.639 --> 00:42:50.849
They lose.
 

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:52.530
What a surprise.
 

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:54.190
They're driven away.
 

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.010
Why do they dress up as women?
 

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:02.039
One thing they do,
mocking the charcoal workers

00:43:02.039 --> 00:43:08.710
also, they put charcoal on their
face and they wear sheets.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:11.590
They try to make them look like
dresses.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:14.039
Why as women?
 

00:43:14.039 --> 00:43:15.670
It's more than a disguise.
 

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:18.840
What it is is an enraged
carnival.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.699
If you think of carnival,
think of Mardi Gras,

00:43:22.699 --> 00:43:29.570
anywhere in Christian Europe,
what you do during carnival,

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.436
look at the floats in New
Orleans when everybody's getting

00:43:32.436 --> 00:43:34.599
wasted and dressing up in
various things.

00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:39.844
The old version of that was
that you dressed up like you're

00:43:39.844 --> 00:43:41.018
exploiters.
 

00:43:41.018 --> 00:43:44.561
The three or four days you
could mock the judge who handed

00:43:44.561 --> 00:43:45.989
out unfair sentences.
 

00:43:45.989 --> 00:43:51.117
You could mock the big fat
noble who had seigneurial rights

00:43:51.117 --> 00:43:52.090
over you.
 

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:54.184
You could mock the
gendarmes,

00:43:54.184 --> 00:43:56.340
who you thought treated you
badly.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.239
You could pretend.
 

00:43:57.239 --> 00:44:01.840
It was a carnival,
but an enraged carnival.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:06.380
During carnival you stand the
world on its head.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.215
What you did in this case is
you dressed up as women,

00:44:09.215 --> 00:44:11.670
reversing reality from their
point of view.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.110
This enraged carnival is
intended,

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:16.130
rather like the
charivari,

00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:21.456
the shivaree in English,
in which you pound on pots and

00:44:21.456 --> 00:44:25.530
pans outside the house of a
couple or a woman,

00:44:25.530 --> 00:44:28.126
for example,
who has married somebody from

00:44:28.126 --> 00:44:28.800
another village.
 

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:32.128
You try to set things right
again by pounding and calling

00:44:32.128 --> 00:44:35.755
attention to a misdeed that has
violated the communal sense of

00:44:35.755 --> 00:44:36.469
justice.
 

00:44:36.469 --> 00:44:38.039
That's what these people are
doing.

00:44:38.039 --> 00:44:40.530
They're saying,
"Respect us.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:42.059
Respect justice."
 

00:44:42.059 --> 00:44:43.730
And, so, they're dressing up
like women.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.429
They're standing the world on
its head.

00:44:45.429 --> 00:44:49.059
It's an enraged,
deadly serious carnival.

00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:52.847
They'll shoot at these people
and beat the hell out of them

00:44:52.847 --> 00:44:54.349
when they catch them.
 

00:44:54.349 --> 00:45:01.021
So, Jean, the lieutenant of the
demoiselles, represents justice

00:45:01.021 --> 00:45:06.940
and this kind of acting out of
this enraged carnival.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:10.780
It's more than a disguise.
 

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:11.980
But they don't win.
 

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.230
Captain Swing doesn't win,
either.

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.500
They're arrested.
 

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.409
They're put on trial.
 

00:45:17.409 --> 00:45:20.929
Some of them are put in jail.
 

00:45:20.929 --> 00:45:25.693
But in the end,
they come back at the end of

00:45:25.693 --> 00:45:30.568
1830,1831, some in 1832,
if I remember right,

00:45:30.568 --> 00:45:36.110
1848 they're back,
1872, but then never again.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:39.902
The AriÃ¨ge as a
department depopulates rapidly

00:45:39.902 --> 00:45:43.329
in the second half of the
nineteenth century.

00:45:43.329 --> 00:45:46.579
These people can't make it in
the forest anymore.

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:48.989
They can't go into the forest
anymore.

00:45:48.989 --> 00:45:52.179
They can't survive with their
little plots of land.

00:45:52.179 --> 00:45:53.260
So, they bail out.
 

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:54.550
They get out.
 

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:57.889
Their great, great,
great grandchildren,

00:45:57.889 --> 00:46:00.090
many of them work in the
aÃ©rospatiale,

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:05.050
the aircraft factories in
Toulouse,

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.630
or go to Bordeaux,
or go to Paris,

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:11.239
or go to Agen,
or end up somewhere else.

00:46:11.239 --> 00:46:14.768
The demoiselles,
like Captain Swing,

00:46:14.768 --> 00:46:19.820
like these grain rioters in all
of these countries,

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:24.670
in Spain, in Britain,
in Prussia, everywhere,

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:29.677
these are the remnants of what
people viewed as a traditional

00:46:29.677 --> 00:46:34.434
way of doing things that at
least was infused with a sense

00:46:34.434 --> 00:46:38.809
of the proper,
a sense of popular justice.

00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:43.010
The demoiselles tried to stand
the world on its head during

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.052
carnival,
and tried to get people to do

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:49.250
the right thing,
to return the forests to them,

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:54.086
to get the threshing machines
the hell out of the big farms in

00:46:54.086 --> 00:46:57.826
Kent and other places,
restore grain and bread to a

00:46:57.826 --> 00:47:01.338
reasonable price so everybody
could have a shot at buying

00:47:01.338 --> 00:47:01.840
some.
 

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.755
But in the end,
they lose out to this dynamic

00:47:05.755 --> 00:47:10.739
duo, this more powerful duo,
the state and capitalism.

00:47:10.739 --> 00:47:15.760
It's bitter hard to write the
history of remainders.

00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.533
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So we were talking 
about green chemistry. 

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.600
Today we'll talk about one
aspect, the Mitsunobu 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.333
reaction, and then get on to
acids and acid derivatives. 

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:15.100
And then we'll do that again
next lecture, more about acid 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.533
derivatives, condensations, and
some stuff about 

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:23.000
carbohydrates, and then the last
two lectures. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.867
Now, remember when we were
talking about green chemistry, 

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:27.100
there were some new processes
that were desired. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.400
There were old processes that
need improvement, and new 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.167
processes that need to be
developed, according to the 

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:40.133
wishes of the pharmaceutical
industry. 

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:44.400
Remember, there were six votes
for aromatic cross-coupling I 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.700
mentioned right at the end last
time. 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.433
That's how to put two benzene
rings or other aromatic rings 

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.367
together, without using
haloaromatics. 

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:57.400
We haven't talked about those
reactions, but that's their 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.867
top desire. 

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:04.333
Then how to use aldehydes or
ketones plus ammonia and 

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:06.667
reduction to give a chiral
amine. 

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:10.933
Now, notice how many of these
things have to do with getting 

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.967
a single enantiomer, because
that's so important in drugs, 

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:15.700
to have a single enantiomer. 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.900
And this, notice what they want
here is to 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.033
do what nature does. 

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:22.900
We talked before about making
glutamic acid by what's called 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.900
reductive amination, where you
have a reducing agent, NADH. 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.400
You make the imine and then
reduce it. 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.833
So four of the six
pharmaceutical companies said 

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:36.700
that was something they would
really like to be able to do. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.967
Or asymmetric hydrogenation of
olefins 

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:41.633
and enamines or imines. 

00:01:41.633 --> 00:01:44.067
And notice, this is
hydrogenation of an imine, 

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:45.667
this very reaction here. 

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:47.533
But what they want is
asymmetric. 

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:51.067
That is, the ability to make a
single enantiomer so you don't 

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:55.467
have to throw half the stuff
away and do a separation. 

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:58.567
Four voted for a greener
fluorination method. 

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:02.533
A lot of drugs have fluorine in
them, and the reagents that 

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:06.667
put those in are often pretty
vigorous ones. 

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:10.367
Nitrogen chemistry, avoiding
azides, and three, avoiding 

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:13.533
hydrazine, which is very
poisonous. 

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.367
Asymmetric hydramination. 

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.233
Again, asymmetric. 

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:19.333
Greener electrophilic nitration.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.733
We talked about electrophilic
aromatic 

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:24.033
substitution, nitration. 

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.833
But what they want is a greener
way to do it. 

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.767
And the final one is asymmetric
addition of HCN. 

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:34.300
Notice, incidentally, that four
of these eight-- half of 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.767
them-- have to do with
asymmetric synthesis, making 

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:38.900
chiral things. 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.467
And notice that six of them, six
of the eight, have to do 

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:44.733
with nitrogen. 

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:50.800
Now at the end last time, we
were talking about the other 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.700
table, the one of processes that
need improving. 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.600
And in particular, something
that seems surprising to many 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.433
chemists is O activation for
nucleophilic substitution. 

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:03.933
We've talked about that so long,
getting a halogen or a 

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:09.367
tosylate that can be
substituted, but they want 

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:10.967
something that's better than
that. 

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:13.933
And noticed that three voted for
a safer and more 

00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:16.233
environmental Mitsunobu
reaction. 

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:19.067
So let's see what the Mitsunobu
reaction is. 

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:23.900
And you'll see that it is a type
of that second case, 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.167
activation of OH for
nucleophilic substitution. 

00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:29.900
So there's a picture of
Mitsunobu. 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.200
And in the 1960s, he invented
this reaction with a great 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.533
leaving group. 

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:39.433
The OP plus Ph1-3 leaving group.

00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:42.800
And so if you bring in a
nucleophile, bingo! 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.733
It's a very clean substitution
reaction, that is clean in the 

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:50.467
sense that it gives a high
yield. 

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:53.567
And it's very general. 

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:57.767
Any nucleophile will work, it
seems, if it has a pKa, if 

00:03:57.767 --> 00:04:00.167
it's more acidic, than 15. 

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:04.067
For example, a carboxylate can
get an R put on it, or the 

00:04:04.067 --> 00:04:10.533
phosphoric acid, or the imide,
or N3 minus, or most 

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:13.633
significantly, active methylene
compounds. 

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:18.800
So let's see what that means,
active methylene compound. 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.133
So here's a specific example
taken from Mitsunobu's paper 

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.333
in the journal Synthesis to make

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:27.800
(S)-(-)-methylsuccinic acid. 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.933
So it's an asymmetric synthesis
to make it, and it 

00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:34.133
starts with a chiral starting
material, 

00:04:34.133 --> 00:04:36.633
(S)-(-)-ethyl lactate. 

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:40.500
So the idea is to make the OH
into a leaving group, so let's 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.833
read through his thing and see
how he does it. 

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:46.267
He uses the reagents 1 and 2. 

00:04:46.267 --> 00:04:50.400
Now, 1 is triphenylphosphine,
and 2 is a compound whose 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.067
acronym is DEAD, and we'll see
later what-- it's diethyl 

00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:57.067
azodicarboxylate. 

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:58.400
So we'll see how that works. 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.933
But at any rate-- those two in
the next slide-- 

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:04.633
but for now, let's just take
that that makes that leaving 

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:09.533
group, puts the triphenyl
phosphorus on the oxygen, with 

00:05:09.533 --> 00:05:10.800
a plus charge. 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.867
So now we've got a good leaving
group, and we want a 

00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:15.200
nucleophile to displace it. 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.600
And the nucleophile they use in
this example is ethyl 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.433
cyanoacetate. 

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:26.600
So it's the ethyl ester of
acetic acid, but the carbon 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.400
has a cyano on it. 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.433
And that makes it an active
methylene compound. 

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:36.233
And the reason is it has a pKa
of 13. 

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:39.100
It's pretty acidic for a CH
bond. 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.733
Now the reason, of course, is
what you get, is an enolate, 

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:43.967
because there's an alpha
carbonyl. 

00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:47.500
It's alpha to a carbonyl, but
it's also alpha to the CN 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.267
triple bond. 

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:52.933
So it's doubly activated by low
LUMOs next door. 

00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:55.733
So it easily makes that anion. 

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:59.300
So this then can be a
nucleophile that will displace 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.500
on the carbon. 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.033
So it's going to come across and
invert the carbon and make 

00:06:06.033 --> 00:06:06.733
the new bond. 

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:09.700
And that's the first product
they want: diethyl 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.200
2-cyano-3-methyl succinate. 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.733
Now, notice they say the yield
is pretty good, 

00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:19.533
61%, right? 

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:23.333
And notice especially that the
conditions are very mild. 

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:26.700
These reactions started at minus
20 degrees and then just 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.833
warmed to room temperature. 

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:30.233
It's not something that needs a
lot of heating. 

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:33.667
On the other hand, they had to
isolate it by preparative 

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:35.567
layer chromatography. 

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:40.933
So that's not an easy thing to
do on a large-ish scale. 

00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:45.400
So that's certainly a painful
thing to do, to try to get-- 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.600
it tends to be insoluble so you
can filter it off. 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.933
But to get the last bits of it
out, you have to do this layer 

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.133
chromatography. 

00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:54.733
So that's certainly not so
great. 

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:01.333
Notice that it says, ultimately
the optical purity 

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:04.600
is greater than 99%. 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.633
Now, this reaction is indeed
very, very clean inversion. 

00:07:08.633 --> 00:07:11.867
So that's one of the hallmarks
of the Mitsunobu reaction. 

00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:16.833
But, in fact, it's not proved by
that 99% purity, because 

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:20.267
you notice, at the end it was
recrystallized. 

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:22.500
The product is recrystallized. 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.000
So even if there was a little
bit of the wrong enantiomer in 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.633
there, when you crystallize it,
you'd get only the right 

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:31.900
enantiomer, in purifying it that
way. 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.567
So this doesn't prove it, but
it's true that it gives very, 

00:07:34.567 --> 00:07:36.833
very clean inversion, and that's
one of its main 

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.267
advantages. 

00:07:38.267 --> 00:07:38.533
OK. 

00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:40.900
But notice, incidentally, that
this isn't the 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.967
product they wanted. 

00:07:41.967 --> 00:07:44.767
This is an intermediate. 

00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:48.933
And notice that there are two
chiral centers. 

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:54.233
This one, which was 99%
inverted, and this one, which 

00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:58.000
came from the anion that did the
attacking, the active 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.433
methylene compound. 

00:07:59.433 --> 00:08:01.000
And there's no reason that that
should 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.933
be only one, right? 

00:08:02.933 --> 00:08:06.267
It could have inverted at this
stage of the anion. 

00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:09.400
That is, the anion would have
been planar because of the 

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.067
conjugation with the double
bonds next door. 

00:08:15.067 --> 00:08:17.933
So wouldn't that lower the
yield? 

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:21.033
No, because of the product
they're finally going to. 

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.333
And you'll see how that is. 

00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:25.700
They hydrolyze this intermediate
to (S)-(-)-methylsuccinic 

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.500
acid, which you notice is what
it is they're 

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.267
trying to make up at the top. 

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:34.267
So they were able to convert the
ester to an acid, the 

00:08:34.267 --> 00:08:37.000
other ester to an acid. 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.333
That's the reverse of a Fischer

00:08:39.333 --> 00:08:41.767
esterification, acid and water.

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:46.300
And the CN triple bond also
hydrolyzes to an acid, 

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.767
although it takes more work. 

00:08:47.767 --> 00:08:51.733
It was heated under reflux for
16 hours, but that converted 

00:08:51.733 --> 00:08:55.533
that one to an acid. And now you
notice this carbon isn't 

00:08:55.533 --> 00:08:58.767
chiral anymore, because it's got
two acid groups. 

00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:02.267
And even more than that, it
turns out that when you have a 

00:09:02.267 --> 00:09:05.167
situation like that, it
decarboxylates. 

00:09:05.167 --> 00:09:09.067
It loses the CO2, and the H
comes on here. 

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:10.900
So again, it's not a chiral
carbon. 

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.700
So this is the product, and the
ultimate 

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.900
yield was 29% overall. 

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:22.867
So that's not 100% reaction, but
it's very, very clean, in 

00:09:22.867 --> 00:09:28.500
terms of the product being
stereochemically pure. 

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.167
And the purity, the
stereochemical purity, the 

00:09:32.167 --> 00:09:35.733
inversion, is sometimes used by
synthetic chemists when 

00:09:35.733 --> 00:09:38.833
they design a complicated
synthesis and they make an 

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:41.433
alcohol, but it turns out not to
be the 

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:43.067
one they want, right? 

00:09:43.067 --> 00:09:44.867
It's the wrong enantiomer. 

00:09:44.867 --> 00:09:47.500
So then they use a version of
this reaction called the 

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.300
Mitsunobu Inversion. 

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.967
So for example, suppose they
made this (S)-configured 

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:57.000
alcohol, but what they really
wanted was the ()R. So what you

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.033
need to do is make that OH into
a leaving group and bring 

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:04.200
an oxygen in from the backside
to make the other one. 

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:09.533
So they can do this, to correct
the synthetic “mistake”, by

00:10:09.533 --> 00:10:15.600
using these reagents
triphenylphosphine and DEAD

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.667
and acetic acids. 

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:20.033
So the acetic acid is something
that's more acidic 

00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:23.967
than pKa 15. 

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:26.633
It's got pKa 5, so it'll do the
trick. 

00:10:26.633 --> 00:10:29.300
So you mix these things
together, do the reaction, and 

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.167
it makes the acetate in the
back. 

00:10:31.167 --> 00:10:33.833
And now that's the ester of the
alcohol you want, so all 

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.433
you have to do is treat it with
acid[correction: base] and get 

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:38.833
the inverted alcohol. 

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:41.133
Now, how does this activation
work? 

00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:44.867
How do you do this in order to
get the great leaving group? 

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:47.633
Well, you react
triphenylphosphine 

00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:49.467
with HOR to do that. 

00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:51.467
But they won't interact
directly. 

00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:54.567
That's, notice, -3, and in the 

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:56.167
product it's -1, 

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:58.700
so you're going to need an
oxidizing agent 

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.567
in order to go there. 

00:10:59.567 --> 00:11:03.467
And that oxidizing agent is this
compound 

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:04.833
number 1 up here. 

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.000
Diethyl-- 

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.567
so it's an ethyl ester on both
ends, notice it's 

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:09.500
symmetrical-- 

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.400
azodicarboxylate, DEAD. 

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.133
Now, this is sort of a
complicated scheme. 

00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:23.600
And it's balanced just right so
the correct nucleophile 

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.433
will attack at each step. 

00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:28.167
There are three nucleophiles
that are involved. 

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:32.200
There's the phosphorus unshared
pair. 

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:36.433
There's the unshared pair on an
oxygen of the alcohol. 

00:11:36.433 --> 00:11:40.767
And there's X minus that was
formed from the acid that you 

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.067
put in, which is ultimately the
thing that's going to do 

00:11:43.067 --> 00:11:43.967
the displacing. 

00:11:43.967 --> 00:11:46.167
That's the nucleophile that
comes in. 

00:11:46.167 --> 00:11:49.467
So you don't want the wrong
nucleophile to be operating at 

00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:51.300
any given time. 

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:51.600
OK. 

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.167
So first, the unshared pair on
phosphorus attacks the double 

00:11:55.167 --> 00:11:58.933
bond on nitrogen, which will put
a charge on this nitrogen 

00:11:58.933 --> 00:12:01.233
here when these electrons go on
there. 

00:12:01.233 --> 00:12:03.833
What's good about having the
charge on that nitrogen? 

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.100
Why would that be better than
adding to any old 

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.600
N=N? 

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.667
STUDENT: Resonance? 

00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:20.133
PROFESSOR: Yeah. It's got the
resonance with the carbonyl, so

00:12:20.133 --> 00:12:24.033
it's going to make this allylic system here. 

00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:24.400
OK. 

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.233
So that comes in. 

00:12:27.233 --> 00:12:31.833
And now this HX is one of these
things that has a pKa 

00:12:31.833 --> 00:12:33.533
less than 15. 

00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:40.233
So it's able, then, to protonate
this-- 

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:43.800
Remember, this is a fairly
stable anion, but it's not as 

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.067
stable as X minus. 

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:48.067
It doesn't have that low a pKa.

00:12:48.067 --> 00:12:51.367
So this one's able to protonate
here. 

00:12:51.367 --> 00:12:56.767
Now, notice, if X attacked-- 

00:12:56.767 --> 00:13:01.167
X is the anion of a pretty good
acid. 

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.167
You could imagine that attacking
the phosphorus to 

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:06.600
make a fifth bond to phosphorus.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:06.867
Right? 

00:13:06.867 --> 00:13:09.067
Phosphorus has vacant
d-orbitals. 

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:12.567
But if it did, it would come off
again, because it's a much 

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:17.267
better anion than the anion
formed if you broke the 

00:13:17.267 --> 00:13:19.133
phosphorus-nitrogen bond. 

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:22.767
So this is an example of it
being tuned just right. 

00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:26.900
So if the X came on it, would
just come off again. 

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:33.000
But if the unshared pair of
oxygen goes on, then you would 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.233
get the bond formed like this. 

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:41.333
And now that would come off
again. 

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:45.200
The protonated oxygen is a
stronger acid 

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.033
than this would be. 

00:13:47.033 --> 00:13:54.433
But if it loses the proton, then
this one is now a better 

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:58.467
leaving group, especially if it
gets protonated. 

00:13:58.467 --> 00:14:03.800
So now we've made this thing
here. 

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.933
We've made the oxygen into a
leaving group. 

00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:11.200
And notice, at the same time,
the nitrogen-nitrogen, which 

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.200
originally was a double bond,
now has two hydrogens on it. 

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.500
So it got reduced, right? 

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.133
That is, it was the oxidizing
agent that

00:14:21.133 --> 00:14:23.833
allowed this to happen. 

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:27.300
And now X minus is able to do
the nucleophilic substitution, 

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.433
and that's how the Mitsunobu
activation happens. 

00:14:32.433 --> 00:14:36.433
And notice that this last one
here, then, is irreversible. 

00:14:36.433 --> 00:14:39.533
Once you put the X on, this is
not a good nucleophile. 

00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:40.767
It's not going to come back on.

00:14:40.767 --> 00:14:45.233
So this is a high yield process,
when you do that one. 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.600
But the problem is that complete
separation required 

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.467
chromatography. 

00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:53.500
That was bad about it. 

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:56.667
And at least this aspect of it
has been improved. 

00:14:56.667 --> 00:14:59.100
And it's an interesting way in
which it's been improved. 

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.133
Instead of using triphenyl
phosphine, the benzene rings 

00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:06.567
of the triphenyl phosphine, some
of them, are attached to 

00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:09.733
a polymer, right, like that. 

00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:12.900
So that means if you have a
polymer bead that holds this 

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.767
reagent, at the end, you don't
have to do the chromatography 

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:19.733
in order to separate your
product from the triphenyl 

00:15:19.733 --> 00:15:21.167
phosphine oxide. 

00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:23.600
You just have to filter it,
because it's attached to a 

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:24.867
solid polymer. 

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.733
But what disturbs the green
chemists about this otherwise 

00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:37.233
handy reaction is that your goal
is to eliminate water 

00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:41.067
between HX and ROH. 

00:15:41.067 --> 00:15:48.000
But in order to do that, you
generate byproducts that have 

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.300
a molecular weight of 450. 

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.500
So this is what's called atom
inefficient. 

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.600
You generate lots of waste for
the way to the 

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.500
molecule you generate. 

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.933
Now, we're going to be talking
about oxidation of aldehydes 

00:16:02.933 --> 00:16:03.567
and alcohols. 

00:16:03.567 --> 00:16:05.800
We have talked about some of
them already. 

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.633
But it's nice to do those in a
green way, too. 

00:16:08.633 --> 00:16:11.267
And in fact, we already talked
about such a 

00:16:11.267 --> 00:16:12.667
reaction last semester. 

00:16:12.667 --> 00:16:18.533
It was one of the first
oxidations of an aldehyde that 

00:16:18.533 --> 00:16:21.133
was studied, which was the oil
of bitter almonds. 

00:16:21.133 --> 00:16:22.800
You remember what was special
about this sample? 

00:16:25.933 --> 00:16:28.833
When you turned it over, it
turned out that this aldehyde 

00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:30.567
was in fact mostly solid. 

00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:36.467
It had converted spontaneously
to benzoic acid without adding 

00:16:36.467 --> 00:16:40.733
any chromium, manganese, or
anything like that. 

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:44.967
You got benzoic acid just by
reacting it with oxygen. 

00:16:44.967 --> 00:16:51.500
So there could hardly be a
cleaner, greener process. 

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:55.733
So the air oxidation of
benzaldehyde is a process that 

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:57.367
I think we've mentioned before,
but I'll 

00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:59.033
talk about it again. 

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:02.300
So it's a free-radical chain
reaction. 

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.667
You have some radical which
pulls the hydrogen away from 

00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:10.433
the aldehyde, which generates
this acyl radical. 

00:17:10.433 --> 00:17:14.367
But the acyl radical can now
attack oxygen to form a new 

00:17:14.367 --> 00:17:18.333
bond, and a single bond to
oxygen, which itself is now a 

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:24.000
radical, which is the X. So X
comes back and takes the 

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.633
hydrogen from the other, and the
product, then, is not 

00:17:27.633 --> 00:17:32.967
benzoic acid, but peroxybenzoic
acid. 

00:17:32.967 --> 00:17:36.767
So that's what you would expect
to get at first. 

00:17:36.767 --> 00:17:42.033
But in fact, it might be fun for
you just to review free 

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:46.033
radical chain reactions by
writing this thing in one of 

00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:49.300
those cyclic diagrams as to what
comes in, where the 

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:50.767
radicals are, what comes out. 

00:17:50.767 --> 00:17:53.767
That would be a good exercise. 

00:17:53.767 --> 00:17:56.133
So this is the initial product.

00:17:56.133 --> 00:17:58.933
But this itself as an oxidizing
agent. 

00:17:58.933 --> 00:18:02.500
It's got this weak oxygen-oxygen
bond, a low 

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.667
LUMO, which is a little bit like
using a 

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:09.567
halogen-halogen bond. 

00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:11.900
So it also is like an alcohol. 

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.800
So it can form a hemiketal by
attacking the carbonyl. 

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.833
So here's the group that
attacked, here's the new bond, 

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:20.800
and we have OH. 

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.267
So it's like a hemiketal, except
it's peroxy. 

00:18:24.267 --> 00:18:29.567
And now notice that it's
converted what would have been 

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:32.933
an OH into an O with a leaving
group. 

00:18:32.933 --> 00:18:36.300
If this had just been a regular
old hydrate of the 

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.933
aldehyde, there would be OH
here. 

00:18:37.933 --> 00:18:39.933
But now we have O with a leaving
group. 

00:18:39.933 --> 00:18:43.700
So a base can pull off the
proton, the electrons come in 

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.667
to make a double bond, these
leave, and now you have 

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:51.367
benzoic acid and benzoate, which
is a base that can do 

00:18:51.367 --> 00:18:54.000
that reaction next time. 

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.300
So what could be a more
efficient reaction? 

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:59.867
All you do is expose
benzaldehyde to oxygen, and it 

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:01.867
becomes benzoic acid. 

00:19:01.867 --> 00:19:06.433
So there's a very green
oxidation reaction. 

00:19:06.433 --> 00:19:10.800
You can see Section 18.12, which
talks about this. 

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.067
But last year when I was talking
about this subject, we 

00:19:14.067 --> 00:19:18.167
had a seminar from a professor
at Weizmann Institute, David 

00:19:18.167 --> 00:19:22.467
Milstein, who talked about
devising catalysts for greener 

00:19:22.467 --> 00:19:23.267
operations. 

00:19:23.267 --> 00:19:25.733
And I thought this one was a
very interesting one. 

00:19:25.733 --> 00:19:29.233
So this is a ruthenium catalyst,
and it has on it 

00:19:29.233 --> 00:19:33.900
carbon monoxide and hydrogen,
and then this funny ligand. 

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.500
It's a pyridine, benzene with
the nitrogen in it, with 

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:43.800
two groups, CH2 here, CH2, and
it has a nitrogen, diethylamine,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.100
on this end, and
di-t-butylphosphine 

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.267
on the other end. 

00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:51.667
So it has three things with
unshared pairs, phosphorus, 

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:55.800
nitrogen, and nitrogen, that can
mix with the orbitals of 

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.700
the ruthenium to make this
complex. 

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:04.200
Now, I've colored two of the
hydrogens here green, because 

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.500
they can come off. 

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:10.233
You could lose H2, having lost
those two hydrogens, notice, 

00:20:10.233 --> 00:20:14.467
or you can add H2 and come back
again. 

00:20:14.467 --> 00:20:17.533
Now, how does that happen? 

00:20:17.533 --> 00:20:21.933
Well, notice that this stuff
here, the nitrogen plus charge 

00:20:21.933 --> 00:20:26.400
with an extra bond here, going
to this kind of ring, is a 

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.233
little bit reminiscent of what
we saw before with 

00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:32.733
NAD plus and NADH. 

00:20:32.733 --> 00:20:36.633
That this is a nucleophilic
aromatic substitution, the 

00:20:36.633 --> 00:20:37.333
start of it. 

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:39.967
So the H minus adds here. 

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:41.967
These go on to the nitrogen. 

00:20:41.967 --> 00:20:45.267
So you have a ring like that
one, and H attached. 

00:20:45.267 --> 00:20:47.967
But the H minus can come off
again, and be given to 

00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:48.967
something else. 

00:20:48.967 --> 00:20:52.200
So this is closely balanced,
right? 

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.200
This one has the advantage of
being aromatic. 

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.933
This one has the advantage of
having a new bond, and not 

00:20:57.933 --> 00:20:59.833
being charged. 

00:20:59.833 --> 00:21:02.533
So being closely balanced, it
can go back and forth. 

00:21:02.533 --> 00:21:06.300
So the same way that NADH in
nature can function as both an 

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.967
oxidizing and a reducing agent,
going one way or 

00:21:08.967 --> 00:21:11.633
another, you could imagine that
a thing like this can go 

00:21:11.633 --> 00:21:12.967
back and forth. 

00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:17.133
So lose the H plus and go back,
as far as the stability 

00:21:17.133 --> 00:21:18.167
in this part of it goes. 

00:21:18.167 --> 00:21:19.867
But there's a problem. 

00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:22.700
The H could be thought of as H
minus, because 

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.233
it's bonded to a metal. 

00:21:25.233 --> 00:21:27.967
So the electrons are mostly on
the more 

00:21:27.967 --> 00:21:29.933
electronegative hydrogen. 

00:21:29.933 --> 00:21:34.433
But it can't reach to that
position, so you can't do that 

00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:36.933
kind of thing. 

00:21:36.933 --> 00:21:40.500
But what it can reach is the
hydrogen here, if we change 

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:43.933
the conformation of the thing a
little bit. 

00:21:43.933 --> 00:21:48.500
So you can imagine that the
hydride attacks this hydrogen, 

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.133
which loses these electrons to
make that bond. 

00:21:53.133 --> 00:21:56.400
And that's helped by the fact
that these electrons then get 

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.867
stabilized by moving on to the
positive nitrogen. 

00:21:59.867 --> 00:22:00.500
Right? 

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.133
So this type of effect is what
allows this to go back and 

00:22:05.133 --> 00:22:06.633
forth in either direction. 

00:22:06.633 --> 00:22:09.833
But we're most interested in the
direction going up. 

00:22:09.833 --> 00:22:14.767
So let's redraw that thing and
look at what happens if 

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:15.767
there's an alcohol. 

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:19.800
So an alcohol comes in, and its
unshared pair makes a bond 

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.567
to the ruthenium, and now it's O
plus. 

00:22:24.567 --> 00:22:29.100
Now we can have the hydride-- 

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.633
notice it's H-- 

00:22:31.633 --> 00:22:33.667
Wait a second, have I done the
right thing here? 

00:22:33.667 --> 00:22:34.667
Oh no. 

00:22:34.667 --> 00:22:37.233
What we're doing is using the
unshared pair of nitrogen. 

00:22:37.233 --> 00:22:38.700
This is not like hydride. 

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.867
I said the wrong thing. 

00:22:39.867 --> 00:22:40.933
This is a proton. 

00:22:40.933 --> 00:22:43.467
The electrons are going away
from this hydrogen. 

00:22:43.467 --> 00:22:47.567
So the proton is able to go on
here, to 

00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:49.267
generate the N plus again. 

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.933
And now notice, at the same
time, that that alcohol that 

00:22:55.933 --> 00:23:00.100
came on had two H's that I drew
explicitly. 

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.133
The one down here is the one I'm
interested in, because 

00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:06.267
it's near the ruthenium. 

00:23:06.267 --> 00:23:10.467
And now if this were O minus-- 

00:23:10.467 --> 00:23:13.833
and notice, in a sense, it is O
minus, because it's bonded 

00:23:13.833 --> 00:23:15.700
to a metal-- 

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.000
then the electrons of the O
minus, these electrons, can 

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.700
make a double bond here, giving
hydride. 

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.333
A hydride can attack the
ruthenium. 

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.267
Like that. 

00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:32.233
So notice what the product of
this is, then. 

00:23:32.233 --> 00:23:37.467
At the top, we get a carbonyl
group, and the thing we have 

00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:42.500
at the bottom is this, which can
start the whole process 

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.400
over again by giving off H2. 

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.033
So what has this whole catalytic
cycle accomplished? 

00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:54.400
You've brought in an alcohol,
and you removed from it these 

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.333
two hydrogens as H2. 

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:05.833
So it's an oxidation of the
alcohol, not by bringing in 

00:24:05.833 --> 00:24:09.133
oxygen and making water, but by
giving off H2. 

00:24:11.933 --> 00:24:16.200
So now in this particular
reaction, there's another 

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.833
oxidation removing H2 from a
different alcohol. 

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:24.300
Notice the product is an
aldehyde, but in water it will 

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.700
form a diol. 

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.267
So it could be the alcohol that
comes in, and you remove 

00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:36.133
another H2 from it, which gives
then a carboxylic acid. 

00:24:36.133 --> 00:24:43.667
Plus you're oxidizing another
alcohol, and have CO coupling, 

00:24:43.667 --> 00:24:45.767
and you get-- 

00:24:45.767 --> 00:24:47.000
Have I done this right? 

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:52.833
I think I counted wrong here. 

00:24:52.833 --> 00:24:55.367
I think I wrote this wrong. 

00:24:55.367 --> 00:24:57.200
I don't think you oxidize that
alcohol. 

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.467
But at any rate, it couples to
give the ester. 

00:24:59.467 --> 00:25:02.633
I think that should be two H2s
there. 

00:25:02.633 --> 00:25:05.933
I'll correct that. 

00:25:05.933 --> 00:25:08.533
But this happens in the presence
of this catalyst with 

00:25:08.533 --> 00:25:10.833
no other activation. 

00:25:10.833 --> 00:25:14.433
So what comes in is the alcohol,
what comes out is two 

00:25:14.433 --> 00:25:17.233
moles of hydrogen and the ester.

00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:17.533
Right? 

00:25:17.533 --> 00:25:20.933
A very clean process. 

00:25:20.933 --> 00:25:26.167
So here's a table taken from
Milstein's paper, and you can 

00:25:26.167 --> 00:25:30.433
see, with several different
alcohols, he was able to get 

00:25:30.433 --> 00:25:34.967
high conversions, higher than
90, up to 99%, very high 

00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:37.633
yields of the ester, and only a
little bit of the aldehyde. 

00:25:37.633 --> 00:25:38.867
Most of it got oxidized. 

00:25:41.533 --> 00:25:43.567
Let's look at the
thermochemistry of this. 

00:25:43.567 --> 00:25:46.433
And again, I think that should
be two H2s. 

00:25:46.433 --> 00:25:50.533
So if you look at the heat of
formation of ethanol and the 

00:25:50.533 --> 00:25:54.800
heat of formation of the ester
that's the product from that, 

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.867
and hydrogen has a free energy
of zero, so the two hydrogens 

00:25:59.867 --> 00:26:00.900
don't count. 

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:05.567
But if we add it together, this
reaction is endothermic 

00:26:05.567 --> 00:26:08.233
by seventeen kilocalories per
mole. 

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:09.500
So it's way uphill. 

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.833
You'd think the equilibrium
constant would be very 

00:26:11.833 --> 00:26:13.233
unfavorable. 

00:26:13.233 --> 00:26:17.667
What makes it possible for this
to happen catalytically? 

00:26:17.667 --> 00:26:20.933
We're not putting in something
that's a strong reagent that 

00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:23.500
makes one of these very
reactive, and then it can 

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.000
react with the other things. 

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.167
We're just putting the alcohol
in. 

00:26:27.167 --> 00:26:30.333
And to have the alcohol come in,
and ester come out, and 

00:26:30.333 --> 00:26:35.033
everything stay the same
otherwise with the catalyst, 

00:26:35.033 --> 00:26:38.267
you have to go uphill in energy
by 17 kilocalories per 

00:26:38.267 --> 00:26:39.967
mole, which sounds very tough. 

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:44.433
But there are two things that
make this good. 

00:26:50.367 --> 00:26:55.433
You start with two molecules,
and you form three molecules. 

00:26:55.433 --> 00:26:57.367
Two H2 and the ester. 

00:26:57.367 --> 00:27:00.467
Again, I counted wrong here. 

00:27:00.467 --> 00:27:03.067
So by making more molecules, you
make 

00:27:03.067 --> 00:27:05.133
more entropy available. 

00:27:05.133 --> 00:27:08.200
And furthermore, this is
especially helped because you 

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.833
make those two hydrogen gas
molecules, and you can remove 

00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:14.333
those from the solution. 

00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:16.600
So notice how this was done. 

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.467
It was done, in one case, under
a flow of argon to sweep 

00:27:20.467 --> 00:27:22.233
the hydrogen gas out. 

00:27:22.233 --> 00:27:26.200
And in the other case, the
toluene solution was refluxed, 

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:30.000
which again, the solvent pushes
the other gas out. 

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.900
So at low pressure of hydrogen,
it's possible to do 

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.133
this spontaneously. 

00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:41.033
So that's an important type of
analysis to do on a catalytic 

00:27:41.033 --> 00:27:45.300
cycle that you've proposed, as
to whether, in fact, it could 

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.067
be thermodynamically allowed. 

00:27:48.067 --> 00:27:51.700
They also were able to make
amines that way, starting with 

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:57.067
alcohols make an imine by
reacting with ammonia. 

00:27:57.067 --> 00:28:00.100
So alcohol plus ammonia gives an
amine. 

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.033
And also, incidentally, an
imine. 

00:28:03.033 --> 00:28:05.333
So probably, it's the same kind
of thing as before. 

00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:09.100
The alcohol gets oxidized to an
aldehyde, but in the 

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.433
presence of the nitrogen, it
forms the imine, the CN double 

00:28:12.433 --> 00:28:18.267
bond, and then that gets reduced
by the hydrogen that's 

00:28:18.267 --> 00:28:21.133
there in order to give the
amine. 

00:28:21.133 --> 00:28:24.467
But again, these are very high
yield reactions. 

00:28:30.533 --> 00:28:34.133
When you look at a synthetic
paper and a table in it, it's 

00:28:34.133 --> 00:28:37.367
important to look at two
different kinds of yields. 

00:28:37.367 --> 00:28:40.533
The normal yields given here are
an analyzed by gas 

00:28:40.533 --> 00:28:43.500
chromatography to figure out how
much was in there. 

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.833
But what you're really
interested in is what you can 

00:28:45.833 --> 00:28:48.500
put in a bottle as a pure form,
right? 

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.267
So the yields in parentheses are
isolated products. 

00:28:51.267 --> 00:28:57.300
So sometimes they're very good,
compared to the gas 

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:58.500
chromatography yield. 

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.333
But in this particular case,
it's hard to separate, and you 

00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:04.933
only get half as much out to
sell to your neighbor as you 

00:29:04.933 --> 00:29:08.867
had analyzed by GC. 

00:29:08.867 --> 00:29:11.833
So you can also make imines and
amides and so on with 

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:12.567
these catalysts. 

00:29:12.567 --> 00:29:15.567
So that's an interesting
development which seems to 

00:29:15.567 --> 00:29:18.533
address, if not to solve
perhaps, some of these 

00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:21.400
problems that the pharmaceutical
industry 

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.967
identified. 

00:29:23.967 --> 00:29:26.867
Now, we've been talking in these
last examples of green 

00:29:26.867 --> 00:29:29.767
chemistry about acids and acid
derivatives. 

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:33.267
So let's talk about them a
little more systematically. 

00:29:33.267 --> 00:29:38.267
First, the acidity of our CO2H,
of a carboxylic acid. 

00:29:38.267 --> 00:29:42.533
You remember that the pKa of a
normal carboxylic acid is 

00:29:42.533 --> 00:29:46.833
between 4 and 5, like butyric
acid is 4.8. 

00:29:46.833 --> 00:29:48.433
Now let's look at the effect of
putting 

00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:50.067
a chlorine in there. 

00:29:50.067 --> 00:29:53.467
So if you put the chlorine in on
the terminal carbon, it 

00:29:53.467 --> 00:29:57.100
hardly changes the pKa at all,
just by 0.3 units. 

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.933
If you move it a little bit
closer to the carboxylic acid, 

00:29:59.933 --> 00:30:03.667
it's 4.1, and if you move it as
close as possible to the 

00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:06.433
carboxylic acid, now it makes a
real difference. 

00:30:06.433 --> 00:30:07.933
2.8. 

00:30:07.933 --> 00:30:10.867
What is it that the chlorine is
doing? 

00:30:14.933 --> 00:30:16.267
STUDENT: It's electron
withdrawing? 

00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:17.467
PROFESSOR: So it's electron
withdrawing. 

00:30:17.467 --> 00:30:19.333
And how does that help? 

00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:21.167
STUDENT: It makes the H come
off. 

00:30:21.167 --> 00:30:25.100
PROFESSOR: And how does it make
the H come off? 

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.467
STUDENT: By reducing the bond
strength. 

00:30:27.467 --> 00:30:29.067
PROFESSOR: Why does it reduce
the bond strength? 

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.733
You know, actually, I bet that's
not true. 

00:30:34.733 --> 00:30:37.300
I bet it doesn't reduce the bond
strength. 

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.600
The bond strength is the kind of
thing that Professor 

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.333
Ellison talked about last time.

00:30:41.333 --> 00:30:44.033
Breaking a bond to give two-- 

00:30:44.033 --> 00:30:45.200
people laugh already. 

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.433
I just mentioned his name, and
they laugh. 

00:30:48.433 --> 00:30:48.867
OK? 

00:30:48.867 --> 00:30:51.267
You break the body and you get
two free-radicals. 

00:30:51.267 --> 00:30:54.367
I don't know the results, but my
strong suspicion is that 

00:30:54.367 --> 00:30:57.267
chlorine hardly affects that at
all. 

00:30:57.267 --> 00:31:01.133
What it affects is dissociation
as an acid. 

00:31:01.133 --> 00:31:02.833
So what is it that the chlorine
is stabilizing? 

00:31:06.067 --> 00:31:07.300
STUDENT: The LUMO? 

00:31:09.367 --> 00:31:11.633
PROFESSOR: It affects the anion,
right? 

00:31:11.633 --> 00:31:16.033
So the electron withdrawal by
the chlorine makes the 

00:31:16.033 --> 00:31:19.467
nearby region of the molecule a
better place to put more 

00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:22.300
electrons, as in the anion
rather 

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.900
than the neutral molecule. 

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.500
So this inductive effect of the
chlorine works, but only 

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.967
in the vicinity of the chlorine.

00:31:28.967 --> 00:31:30.733
It dies away as you get further
and 

00:31:30.733 --> 00:31:32.367
further from the chlorine. 

00:31:32.367 --> 00:31:35.800
So this is so-called inductive
effect. 

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.033
And it's not very big if you're
far away, but if you 

00:31:38.033 --> 00:31:41.467
get pretty close, it can be big.

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:46.167
Now let's just see this
inductive effect, if it could 

00:31:46.167 --> 00:31:49.433
be quantitatively reasonable. 

00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:53.767
If the withdrawal by the
chlorine stabilizes the 

00:31:53.767 --> 00:31:58.967
negative charge by a certain
amount of energy, then the 

00:31:58.967 --> 00:32:06.033
equilibrium becomes easier by
that amount of energy, and 

00:32:06.033 --> 00:32:11.533
that energy difference would
appear in the exponent for the 

00:32:11.533 --> 00:32:12.467
equilibrium constant. 

00:32:12.467 --> 00:32:15.267
Remember, 10 to the 2/3 delta H.

00:32:15.267 --> 00:32:20.633
So it would make a certain
energy effect in the exponent, 

00:32:20.633 --> 00:32:24.467
and if you put two of them in,
you'd make twice that change 

00:32:24.467 --> 00:32:27.867
in the exponent, if it were
simple. 

00:32:27.867 --> 00:32:31.233
And that means results would be
multiplicative, because 

00:32:31.233 --> 00:32:34.167
when you add things in an
exponent, that means you 

00:32:34.167 --> 00:32:35.400
multiply the numbers. 

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:37.900
OK. 

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:43.900
So let's look at acetic acid,
chloroacetic acid, dichloro 

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.767
and trichloroacetic acid, and
see whether this inductive 

00:32:47.767 --> 00:32:53.500
effect of the chlorine is
additive in energy, therefore 

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.767
multiplicative in equilibrium
constant. 

00:32:57.767 --> 00:33:01.933
Or if you do the log of the
equilibrium constant, then it 

00:33:01.933 --> 00:33:05.133
would be additive, because it's
up in the exponent. 

00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:07.833
So notice, here it's 4.8. 

00:33:07.833 --> 00:33:09.367
Same as here. 

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:12.200
Here it's 2.9, same as here. 

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.433
So it's the same kind of effect.

00:33:16.133 --> 00:33:19.833
But let's look at the values
here, not at the values 

00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:21.367
themselves, but at the
difference. 

00:33:21.367 --> 00:33:24.167
How much difference did that
first chlorine make? 

00:33:24.167 --> 00:33:28.200
It made a difference of 1.9 pKa
units. 

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.933
Now, if the second one had the
same effect on the energy of 

00:33:31.933 --> 00:33:34.933
an anion, that would also be
1.9. 

00:33:34.933 --> 00:33:36.500
It's actually 1.6. 

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.767
Not quite as big. 

00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:41.567
And the third one hardly makes
any difference at all. 

00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:42.933
It's only 0.6. 

00:33:42.933 --> 00:33:47.467
I mean, it's substantial, but
it's not anything like the 

00:33:47.467 --> 00:33:48.633
first ones. 

00:33:48.633 --> 00:33:52.067
And the reason is that once the
anion is already 

00:33:52.067 --> 00:33:55.400
stabilized, it gets harder and
harder to 

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.267
withdraw subsequent electrons. 

00:33:57.267 --> 00:34:00.567
One chlorine withdraws a certain
amount. 

00:34:00.567 --> 00:34:03.500
The next chlorine doesn't have
as much to withdraw, so it 

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.733
can't do quite as good a job. 

00:34:04.733 --> 00:34:08.733
The third one does a much poorer
job. 

00:34:08.733 --> 00:34:12.633
But fluorine is better than
chlorine, and trifluoroacetic 

00:34:12.633 --> 00:34:14.300
acid is quite a strong acid. 

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.300
It's got a negative pKa. 

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.733
So that's the inductive effect.

00:34:19.733 --> 00:34:23.533
And now we might wonder, what is
it that makes the 

00:34:23.533 --> 00:34:27.800
carboxylic acid acidic
altogether, ignoring these 

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.500
additional inductive effects? 

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:36.533
So Paul Rablen from Swarthmore
College published a paper in 

00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:38.967
the Journal of the American
Chemical Society in 2000 that 

00:34:38.967 --> 00:34:41.233
had an interesting analysis of
this. 

00:34:41.233 --> 00:34:47.667
And I put it on because
Professor Ellison is such a 

00:34:47.667 --> 00:34:50.967
big advocate of resonance
structures, as you saw last 

00:34:50.967 --> 00:34:53.833
time, rather than molecular
orbital theory. 

00:34:53.833 --> 00:34:56.467
So this is an interesting
analysis, in terms of 

00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:58.133
resonance structures. 

00:34:58.133 --> 00:35:03.467
Now, what he did is do very good
calculations, but 

00:35:03.467 --> 00:35:08.067
calculations in the gas phase,
not in a solvent, of what the 

00:35:08.067 --> 00:35:10.733
equilibrium constant should be,
or what the energy 

00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:13.467
involved should be in
transferring a proton from an 

00:35:13.467 --> 00:35:18.333
alcohol to a carboxylic acid. 

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:20.867
So you get the anion of the
alcohol, and the protonated 

00:35:20.867 --> 00:35:22.467
carboxylic acid. 

00:35:22.467 --> 00:35:26.833
And now, the carboxylic acids
are called acids because they 

00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.733
give their protons to bases. 

00:35:28.733 --> 00:35:31.100
So this reaction lies to the
left. 

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.800
And to go to the right is uphill
by almost 28 

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.000
kilocalories per mole in the gas
phase. 

00:35:39.433 --> 00:35:42.400
Now, the difference in pKa, the
pKa of an 

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.833
alcohol is about 16. 

00:35:43.833 --> 00:35:47.600
The pKa of a carboxylic acid is
about 5. 

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.967
So the difference in pKa is
about 11. 

00:35:51.967 --> 00:35:54.433
Therefore, you would expect the
equilibrium constant at 

00:35:54.433 --> 00:35:57.967
room temperature to be about 4/3
of that. 

00:35:57.967 --> 00:36:02.200
So it should be about 15
kilocalories per mole. 

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:07.100
But notice that pKas are defined
in water, so it must 

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:11.333
be that the solvent makes an
enormous effect, right? 

00:36:11.333 --> 00:36:16.700
It reduces this to about half of
its value, from close to 30 

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.933
to 15, by making it easier to go
to the right. 

00:36:20.933 --> 00:36:23.700
Only 15 kilocalories uphill,
instead of 30 

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.300
kilocalories uphill. 

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.100
Why? 

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.333
It could be because this one has
a much more concentrated 

00:36:29.333 --> 00:36:33.267
negative charge, so it gets more
effectively solvated by 

00:36:33.267 --> 00:36:36.167
the water, compared to this one,
which helps drive the 

00:36:36.167 --> 00:36:37.500
reaction on the left. 

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.033
But anyhow, that's a secondary
consideration, because we're 

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:43.933
just looking, as Rablen did, at
the 

00:36:43.933 --> 00:36:46.433
molecules in the gas phase. 

00:36:46.433 --> 00:36:46.767
OK. 

00:36:46.767 --> 00:36:51.133
So it's 28 kilocalories uphill
to do that. 

00:36:51.133 --> 00:36:52.567
Now, what's the reason? 

00:36:52.567 --> 00:36:54.400
Why does it want to go that way?

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.267
Well, we're tempted to say
resonance. 

00:36:58.267 --> 00:37:01.067
That's certainly what Ellison
would have said. 

00:37:01.067 --> 00:37:04.167
You have two resonance
structures of this anion, and 

00:37:04.167 --> 00:37:06.533
only one resonance structure
that's 

00:37:06.533 --> 00:37:09.667
reasonable on the right. 

00:37:09.667 --> 00:37:13.733
Can you think of any other
reason that it might be good 

00:37:13.733 --> 00:37:16.500
to go to the left? 

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:21.433
Anything else that makes that a
better anion, compared to 

00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:23.200
this anion other than resonance?

00:37:26.333 --> 00:37:27.033
Any idea? 

00:37:27.033 --> 00:37:28.100
These are Hs's. 

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.700
Incidentally. 

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.000
CH3. 

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.233
And here's HCOO minus. 

00:37:35.233 --> 00:37:37.767
If resonance weren't a factor,
would you expect 

00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:39.633
these to be the same? 

00:37:39.633 --> 00:37:40.900
Would you expect the equilibrium

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.133
constant to be one? 

00:37:45.767 --> 00:37:46.667
Amy? 

00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:52.633
STUDENT: Well, no, because the
pi* is helping out. 

00:37:52.633 --> 00:37:52.967
PROFESSOR: Yeah. 

00:37:52.967 --> 00:37:56.933
The pi-star helping out is the
molecular orbital way of 

00:37:56.933 --> 00:37:58.967
saying there's resonance. 

00:37:58.967 --> 00:38:00.133
That's how they do it. 

00:38:00.133 --> 00:38:02.200
So that, in fact, is the same
thing. 

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.600
But is there anything else that
would tend to 

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.667
make it go that way? 

00:38:07.667 --> 00:38:09.667
STUDENT: Having the other oxygen
up there? 

00:38:09.667 --> 00:38:11.800
PROFESSOR: And how would the
oxygen help? 

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.633
STUDENT: Inductive effect? 

00:38:12.633 --> 00:38:13.933
PROFESSOR: So it could be an
inductive effect. 

00:38:13.933 --> 00:38:17.933
But notice this oxygen is closer
than the chlorine that 

00:38:17.933 --> 00:38:19.867
was making the difference
before. 

00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:23.033
The chlorine was out on the next
carbon. 

00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:25.133
So you could also have an
inductive 

00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:27.067
effect due to the oxygen. 

00:38:27.067 --> 00:38:30.633
Now, notice that it's a double
bond. 

00:38:30.633 --> 00:38:33.300
So it's an interesting question
whether you count the 

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:35.067
oxygen once or count it twice. 

00:38:38.533 --> 00:38:43.500
So for purposes of this paper,
Rablen hypothesized that you 

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.767
count the oxygen twice. 

00:38:46.767 --> 00:38:50.800
So now we have resonance and
inductive effects, and we can 

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.233
do some numerology about these,
about how important 

00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:57.133
resonance structures are. 

00:38:57.133 --> 00:38:57.500
OK. 

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:02.133
So notice that this 27.0
kilocalories is due to loss of 

00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:07.033
resonance and to loss of two
inductive effects for oxygen, 

00:39:07.033 --> 00:39:09.967
if you're supposed to count it
twice with the double bond. 

00:39:09.967 --> 00:39:13.700
Now, let's look at this one,
where instead of using 

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.167
alcohol, we used the ketone and
a 

00:39:16.167 --> 00:39:17.967
protonated acid here. 

00:39:17.967 --> 00:39:21.267
So instead of the anion, it's
protonated now. 

00:39:21.267 --> 00:39:24.700
And now we transfer the proton
from here to the ketone-- 

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.033
or it's the aldehyde, actually.

00:39:26.033 --> 00:39:28.133
these are hydrogens. 

00:39:28.133 --> 00:39:29.900
So we make the protonated ketone
and 

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:32.000
the carboxylic acid. 

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.933
Now, here the reaction lies to
the right. 

00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:41.100
It's exothermic by 6.2
kilocalories per 

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.567
mole in the gas phase. 

00:39:42.567 --> 00:39:44.900
Now, which side would resonance
favor? 

00:39:49.233 --> 00:39:50.467
Debbie, can you help us out? 

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:57.300
Would you draw resonance
structures of this? 

00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:57.333
STUDENT: You could. 

00:39:57.333 --> 00:39:58.100
PROFESSOR: You could. 

00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:01.300
You could use the unshared pair
on the OH, and it would 

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:03.067
be stabilized by the pi*, 

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:06.067
but that would require
separation of charge, and 

00:40:06.067 --> 00:40:09.633
Ellison told us we don't want to
do that. 

00:40:09.633 --> 00:40:10.600
How about on the left? 

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.967
Any resonance structures there?

00:40:13.967 --> 00:40:15.233
STUDENT: Yes. 

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.367
Because of the positive charge?

00:40:18.367 --> 00:40:19.567
PROFESSOR: Speak up. 

00:40:19.567 --> 00:40:22.267
STUDENT: Because of the positive
charge. 

00:40:22.267 --> 00:40:24.133
PROFESSOR: Now you could draw a
double bond here 

00:40:24.133 --> 00:40:26.333
and a single bond there and put
the charge on the bottom. 

00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:27.733
And you're not separating
charge, you're 

00:40:27.733 --> 00:40:29.067
just moving the charge. 

00:40:29.067 --> 00:40:31.200
So here you have good resonance.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.967
Here on the right you don't have
reasonable resonance. 

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:39.400
On this one you had resonance on
the left 

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.700
and not on the right. 

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.433
So now-- 

00:40:43.433 --> 00:40:44.067
or no, pardon. 

00:40:44.067 --> 00:40:46.500
In both cases, we had resonance
on the left. 

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:46.767
OK. 

00:40:46.767 --> 00:40:51.767
So resonance is going to favor
the left and cause you to go 

00:40:51.767 --> 00:40:53.433
uphill, in either case. 

00:40:56.100 --> 00:41:00.400
Now, how about the inductive
effect? 

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.667
How about the oxygen? 

00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:04.000
Let's try somebody else here. 

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.367
Chris, which side is favored by
the inductive effect? 

00:41:08.367 --> 00:41:12.300
In the top, the inductive effect
favored the left, 

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:16.533
because we had two bonds to
oxygen withdrawing electrons, 

00:41:16.533 --> 00:41:19.500
stabilizing in the anion, right?

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.667
Now how about in this case, when
we have two bonds here? 

00:41:22.667 --> 00:41:23.900
STUDENT: Favors the right. 

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.300
PROFESSOR: If it stabilizes the
anion, the 

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:32.700
argument is, it destabilizes the
cation. 

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.433
So it's the same deal. 

00:41:34.433 --> 00:41:41.000
Except now... the same resonance
that would cause it to go 

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.600
uphill to the right, but the
oxygen now makes it 

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.000
go down[correction: up] to the
left. 

00:41:48.533 --> 00:41:52.167
Now, how many oxygens did we
have? 

00:41:52.167 --> 00:41:55.167
This time the difference between
this and this 

00:41:55.167 --> 00:41:56.400
is just this bond. 

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.300
So it's not a question of
counting one or two. 

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.933
There's only one bond there. 

00:42:02.933 --> 00:42:06.867
So that's one inductive effect
of oxygen. 

00:42:06.867 --> 00:42:11.333
Now we have two equations and
two unknowns. 

00:42:11.333 --> 00:42:14.100
We have the resonance effect,
which is the same direction in 

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:18.933
both cases, and the inductive
effect, which is in opposite 

00:42:18.933 --> 00:42:22.400
directions and twice as strong,
in one case. 

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.700
So if we take the difference of
these two, minus this one, 

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:33.700
we get plus 34.1 is three of the
oxygen inductive effect. 

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:38.633
So the oxygen inductive effect
is 11.4 kilocalories per mole. 

00:42:38.633 --> 00:42:41.833
And once we have that, we can
plug back in to see how big 

00:42:41.833 --> 00:42:44.667
the resonance effect is. 

00:42:44.667 --> 00:42:45.900
It's 4.8. 

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.667
And now, from this point of
view, if we look in the top 

00:42:53.667 --> 00:42:59.167
case of that 30 kilocalories per
mole going uphill, only 5 

00:42:59.167 --> 00:43:01.733
of it was due to resonance. 

00:43:01.733 --> 00:43:04.633
By far and away, the dominant
effect is 

00:43:04.633 --> 00:43:06.667
the inductive effect. 

00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:10.267
Only 20% of the special acidity
of the carboxylic acid 

00:43:10.267 --> 00:43:14.933
is due to resonance from this
viewpoint. 

00:43:14.933 --> 00:43:16.700
Now, you may buy this resonance

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.467
argument, and you may not. 

00:43:18.467 --> 00:43:20.633
I'm personally skeptical. 

00:43:20.633 --> 00:43:24.533
But one way or the other, it
would be good to check it. 

00:43:24.533 --> 00:43:27.467
So Rablen checked it. 

00:43:27.467 --> 00:43:31.233
He did this one with carbonic
acid, the 

00:43:31.233 --> 00:43:33.367
anion of carbonic acid. 

00:43:33.367 --> 00:43:36.867
And now that's plus 37.3. 

00:43:36.867 --> 00:43:38.367
Now, what does it involve? 

00:43:38.367 --> 00:43:42.767
Here's the anion, which is
stabilized by resonance, as 

00:43:42.767 --> 00:43:45.600
this one was. 

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.900
And there's no resonance
involved in this one, because 

00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:49.167
it has the hydrogen on it. 

00:43:53.033 --> 00:43:55.367
So it has resonance, the same as
the others. 

00:43:55.367 --> 00:43:56.733
How about inductive effect? 

00:43:59.333 --> 00:44:03.767
Compared to this, how many
oxygens are 

00:44:03.767 --> 00:44:06.633
stabilizg in this O minus? 

00:44:06.633 --> 00:44:08.000
Matt? 

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.433
STUDENT: I can count three. 

00:44:09.433 --> 00:44:09.933
PROFESSOR: Count three. 

00:44:09.933 --> 00:44:12.633
If you count double bond twice,
which is the rules he 

00:44:12.633 --> 00:44:15.267
set, then you have three. 

00:44:15.267 --> 00:44:19.233
So that's O inductive times
three. 

00:44:19.233 --> 00:44:20.833
Now let's put that together. 

00:44:20.833 --> 00:44:23.200
So we have O inductive times 3.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:26.700
That's 34.2. 

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:32.733
And the resonance is 4.8, is 39.

00:44:32.733 --> 00:44:34.933
Not bad. 

00:44:34.933 --> 00:44:37.267
So we can try another one. 

00:44:37.267 --> 00:44:41.933
Here we do the analog of what we
did here, put a proton on. 

00:44:41.933 --> 00:44:47.667
And now we have no resonance on
the right. 

00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:50.033
We have resonance on the left. 

00:44:50.033 --> 00:44:54.633
How many resonance structures in
addition to 

00:44:54.633 --> 00:44:55.933
the original structure? 

00:44:55.933 --> 00:45:04.867
STUDENT: Two? 

00:45:04.867 --> 00:45:06.867
PROFESSOR: Chris? You can draw
the double bond here. 

00:45:06.867 --> 00:45:08.600
That's what we did in that case.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.967
But you can also draw the double
bond over here. 

00:45:12.967 --> 00:45:16.667
So there should be resonance
times two. 

00:45:16.667 --> 00:45:21.833
And that should favor the left,
make it uphill. 

00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:25.433
But also, you're going to have
oxygens destabilizing this 

00:45:25.433 --> 00:45:30.233
cation, two oxygens
destabilizing that cation. 

00:45:30.233 --> 00:45:32.767
And if you put those together,
it's minus 13.2, 

00:45:32.767 --> 00:45:37.033
and observed is 11. 

00:45:37.033 --> 00:45:41.767
So there are people who think
this, right? 

00:45:41.767 --> 00:45:45.200
I personally don't like this
kind of argument so much, 

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.133
because I don't think it comes
down to really the 

00:45:47.133 --> 00:45:47.967
physics of the thing. 

00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:51.467
It comes to whether you count a
double bond as two bonds and 

00:45:51.467 --> 00:45:52.467
things like that. 

00:45:52.467 --> 00:45:55.067
Which, it works out. 

00:45:55.067 --> 00:45:57.367
So there are people who talk
about this thing. 

00:45:57.367 --> 00:46:00.700
And from that point of view,
resonance isn't as important 

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:05.500
to making acids acidic as
inductive effect is. 

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.233
So the inductive effect is
certainly important. 

00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:11.133
Now, making acids by oxidation
and reduction. 

00:46:11.133 --> 00:46:13.567
And we've talked about these
things. 

00:46:13.567 --> 00:46:16.833
Oxidizing an alcohol with
chromium, oxidizing-- 

00:46:16.833 --> 00:46:19.667
and remember, on the way, you
get an aldehyde, so you can 

00:46:19.667 --> 00:46:21.033
also oxidize aldehydes. 

00:46:21.033 --> 00:46:22.533
And you can do it with chromium.

00:46:22.533 --> 00:46:25.400
I put potassium permanganate in
here. 

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.567
We also talked about oxidizing
double bonds with ozone and 

00:46:28.567 --> 00:46:32.200
then hydrogen peroxide to get
carboxylic acids. 

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:35.700
There's one different type of
oxidation that we haven't 

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.900
talked about yet which is
mentioned in the Jones 

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:44.667
textbook here, which is alkyl
groups attached to a benzene 

00:46:44.667 --> 00:46:48.900
ring can be oxidized by
permanganate at 100 degrees to 

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.367
make carboxylic acids, as well.

00:46:52.367 --> 00:46:58.333
Now, you can also make
carboxylic acids by reduction. 

00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:02.833
Of course, the carbon in a
carboxylic acid is pretty much 

00:47:02.833 --> 00:47:04.700
oxidized, right? 

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:10.700
But there are more oxidized
things, like CO2. 

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:14.867
So if you had CO2, what would
you react it with in order to 

00:47:14.867 --> 00:47:18.867
form a carbon-carbon bond to
make a carboxylic acid? 

00:47:22.667 --> 00:47:25.033
What kind of reagent? 

00:47:25.033 --> 00:47:28.500
What would attack the carbon of
CO2? 

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.767
High HOMO or low LUMO? 

00:47:33.233 --> 00:47:36.300
What would make CO2 double bond
double bond? 

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.533
What would make it reactive? 

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.400
Suppose it were just a single
double bond. 

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.533
What makes it reactive? 

00:47:45.533 --> 00:47:46.967
The pi*, right? 

00:47:46.967 --> 00:47:48.033
The low LUMO. 

00:47:48.033 --> 00:47:50.167
So you want a high HOMO. 

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:52.867
It's like the things we talked
about with alcohols, right, 

00:47:52.867 --> 00:47:57.233
where you could have a ketone,
react it with R minus, react 

00:47:57.233 --> 00:48:00.867
it with H minus, to go on, and
in this case that would be a 

00:48:00.867 --> 00:48:04.067
reduction of the central carbon,
and would form a 

00:48:04.067 --> 00:48:05.533
carboxylic acid. 

00:48:05.533 --> 00:48:09.133
So you can do that kind of
thing, too. 

00:48:09.133 --> 00:48:14.300
You can also react carboxylic
acids with alkyl lithium, or 

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.100
hydride compounds. 

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:19.633
So for example, you could react
a generic carboxylic 

00:48:19.633 --> 00:48:21.533
acid here with alkyl lithium. 

00:48:21.533 --> 00:48:23.033
What do you think the product
is? 

00:48:28.667 --> 00:48:30.733
Alkyl lithium is like R minus,
right? 

00:48:30.733 --> 00:48:35.433
It's a high HOMO on the R, the R
lithium bond. 

00:48:35.433 --> 00:48:37.367
So what will it attack? 

00:48:40.533 --> 00:48:41.633
Mary? 

00:48:41.633 --> 00:48:44.567
STUDENT: Is it addition at the
carbon? 

00:48:44.567 --> 00:48:45.667
PROFESSOR: Addition to what? 

00:48:45.667 --> 00:48:47.233
STUDENT: To the carbony pi*. 

00:48:47.233 --> 00:48:48.367
PROFESSOR: To the cabonyl right.

00:48:48.367 --> 00:48:51.867
That's what I was trying to
trick you into saying. 

00:48:51.867 --> 00:48:58.000
In fact it reacts in another
way. What else does a high HOMO

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.133
do, besides make something a
nucleophile? 

00:49:03.133 --> 00:49:06.900
It makes it a base. And here we
have and acid. 

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:10.800
So in fact the easy thing to
react with is the proton. 

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.467
That's easier to access than the
carbonyl 

00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:17.467
Oops! I'm sorry I've talked too
long. 

00:49:17.467 --> 00:49:20.467
Thanks for your patience.

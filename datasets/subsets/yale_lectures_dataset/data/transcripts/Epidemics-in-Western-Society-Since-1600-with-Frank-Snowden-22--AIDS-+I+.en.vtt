00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.090
Prof: Our subject this
morning,

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.350
and next time,
is the AIDS pandemic,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.730
and I'll start this morning
dealing--

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.937
in a sense by popular demand,
because I know from visiting

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:20.775
sections that people were
particularly concerned with

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:25.203
bringing this study up to date
and talking about where we are

00:00:25.203 --> 00:00:26.680
at the moment.
 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.932
So, I'll be concentrating
largely on the global pandemic

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.320
and where we are today.
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.773
Then next time we'll look more
conventionally at the history of

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:44.890
the AIDS epidemic,
focusing on this country and

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.510
the experience of the United
States--

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.230
is how I'm proposing to do it.
 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.361
We'll start with the sort of
run through of things that you

00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:59.223
probably know very well,
but that we really ought to

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:03.061
discuss a bit as background--
the nature of the disease,

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.620
its course in the body and its
symptoms--

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.983
and then we'll move on to the
epidemiology of where the

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:15.786
pandemic is today,
and some of both the worrying

00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:22.561
aspects about this pandemic,
and also a couple of the rays

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.938
of hope,
that of progress that has been

00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:28.611
made,
especially in the last couple

00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:29.360
of years.
 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.269
So, that's where we're headed
this morning.

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:37.873
First of all,
in terms of the disease--you

00:01:37.873 --> 00:01:42.251
know already,
because we've talked about

00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:46.629
viruses--in this case a
retrovirus.

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:53.328
Here we have a slide,
a schematic picture of the HIV

00:01:53.328 --> 00:01:54.379
virus.
 

00:01:54.379 --> 00:02:02.115
You know about it;
that it's a core containing two

00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:08.213
strands of genetic material,
RNA, encased in a membrane,

00:02:08.213 --> 00:02:12.758
with two glycoproteins on the
surface.

00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:18.122
The glycoproteins,
particularly this one,

00:02:18.122 --> 00:02:25.498
120, is crucial for allowing
the virus to target certain

00:02:25.498 --> 00:02:26.840
cells.
 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.078
In the case of this virus,
it targets the T4 cells in the

00:02:33.078 --> 00:02:36.116
body,
which are the ones that

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:41.906
regulate antibodies and are the
regulators of the body's immune

00:02:41.906 --> 00:02:42.840
system.
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.680
Well, once attached to the T4
cell, the RNA penetrates the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.639
host cell, and for a time it's
inactive, even for years.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.770
There then occurs a trigger,
or detonator,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.840
which may be--this is a little
speculative--

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.520
an infection that activates the
T4 cells,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.885
and then the RNA is converted
into DNA that penetrates the

00:03:13.885 --> 00:03:19.818
chromosomes of the host cell and
turns it into a factory for the

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:25.280
reproduction of the virus and
the killing of the cell.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.818
So, the retrovirus is an
absolute parasite.

00:03:29.818 --> 00:03:35.644
It takes over the controls of
living T cells and turns them

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:39.258
into factories to reproduce
virus.

00:03:39.258 --> 00:03:43.180
Now, this we can see also in a
picture.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:53.514
This is a slide of an infected
T cell, and this is an image of

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:57.750
a cell reproducing HIV.
 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.024
And finally let me show you,
this is a picture of an HIV

00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:08.930
particle budding from an
infected T cell.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.550
This is how the--part of the
mechanism of the disease.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.396
And let's talk about what
happens to the body in terms of

00:04:18.396 --> 00:04:19.350
symptoms.
 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.449
First there's an incubation
period of some six to eight

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.740
weeks, after which there occurs
the primary infection.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.226
Symptoms at that stage,
in the majority of cases,

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:37.478
are flu-like;
that is to say fever,

00:04:37.478 --> 00:04:41.112
night sweats,
muscular aches and pains,

00:04:41.112 --> 00:04:45.882
fatigue, swollen lymph nodes,
headache, sore throat,

00:04:45.882 --> 00:04:50.399
sometimes diarrhea,
sometimes a rash.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:54.214
Then the symptoms disappear
after a few weeks,

00:04:54.214 --> 00:04:59.218
and in many cases there's a
prolonged period that's entirely

00:04:59.218 --> 00:05:00.660
asymptomatic.
 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.509
This is a period of latency,
which can last months,

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.699
and has been known to last even
as long as ten years or more,

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.800
the time being entirely
unpredictable.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.649
But during this period,
the virus continues to multiply

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:23.689
and destroy the cells of the
immune system.

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.723
Then there comes the period of
active AIDS, where there are

00:05:29.723 --> 00:05:35.446
direct lesions caused by the
retrovirus, carried in some

00:05:35.446 --> 00:05:37.839
cases to the brain.
 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:43.305
Sometimes there's neurological
damage, known as AIDS dementia,

00:05:43.305 --> 00:05:47.964
or loss of motor control,
memory, sometimes reasoning

00:05:47.964 --> 00:05:48.860
power.
 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.389
But the characteristic,
as you know,

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.509
of AIDS, different from most
infections,

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.649
is that it's not the symptoms
that it causes itself,

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:06.281
but rather its ability to give
rise to opportunistic infections

00:06:06.281 --> 00:06:10.370
by switching off the body's
immune system,

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.701
making it vulnerable to an
exotic variety of infections

00:06:14.701 --> 00:06:17.509
that the body is unable to
fight.

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:21.209
This is immunosuppression.
 

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:26.874
Later in the disease,
the victim experiences weight

00:06:26.874 --> 00:06:31.632
loss, lethargy,
recurrent yeast infections,

00:06:31.632 --> 00:06:36.730
rashes or sores,
fevers and night sweats.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.742
Active AIDS develops when a
patient has fewer,

00:06:41.742 --> 00:06:47.759
with HIV, than 200 T cells per
micro liter of blood.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:52.230
The normal count is 800 to 1200.
 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.564
From this point,
the average untreated--and I

00:06:56.564 --> 00:07:02.572
stress untreated--AIDS patient
has about two or three years to

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:03.459
live.
 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:09.057
Sometimes other symptoms
develop: difficulty swallowing,

00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:13.331
loss of memory,
cough, shortness of breath,

00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:18.319
sometimes seizure,
nausea or impaired vision.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:24.781
But death is usually caused by
a whole array of opportunistic

00:07:24.781 --> 00:07:29.125
infections,
with names familiar to you,

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:33.314
like candidiasis,
pneumocystis carinii

00:07:33.314 --> 00:07:36.401
pneumonia,
Kaposi's sarcoma,

00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:41.620
cytomegalovirus,
cryptococcal meningitis;

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:46.519
but above all tuberculosis,
which is the most important of

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:49.959
the opportunistic infections of
AIDS,

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:53.286
and globally,
at least, the most common

00:07:53.286 --> 00:07:55.649
immediate cause of death.
 

00:07:55.649 --> 00:07:58.980
Note this characteristic of
AIDS.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.175
Its course is not just the
direct result of the virus

00:08:03.175 --> 00:08:07.812
itself on the body,
but those pathologies which are

00:08:07.812 --> 00:08:12.797
substratum are combined with
those of a series of other

00:08:12.797 --> 00:08:16.860
diseases superimposed on the
AIDS virus,

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.761
because of the progressive
destruction of the immune

00:08:20.761 --> 00:08:21.449
system.
 

00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:27.101
And note how well adapted the
virus is to its ecological niche

00:08:27.101 --> 00:08:29.509
in the human population.
 

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:34.293
It's a lethal disease,
but one that avoids killing its

00:08:34.293 --> 00:08:36.009
host too quickly.
 

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:40.681
A major evolutionary advantage
begins with a lengthy

00:08:40.681 --> 00:08:46.437
asymptomatic latent period,
as HIV, when it's contagious,

00:08:46.437 --> 00:08:52.035
but the infective patient
almost certainly doesn't know

00:08:52.035 --> 00:08:57.740
that he or she harbors the virus
in his or her body.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.399
And then full-blown AIDS can
last for long years,

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:06.669
while again the patient remains
infective.

00:09:06.669 --> 00:09:09.629
Well, what about transmission?
 

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:14.230
Transmission can occur in a
variety of ways.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:17.350
As you know,
it's transmitted sexually.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:19.850
Everyone knows that.
 

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.581
We need to remember there was a
myth about AIDS,

00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:28.264
in the outset in this country
in the '80s, that it was a gay

00:09:28.264 --> 00:09:31.440
plague, that it spread
homosexually.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:36.595
And you all know about the
Moral Majority and Reverend

00:09:36.595 --> 00:09:40.485
Jerry Falwell,
who welcomed AIDS as God's

00:09:40.485 --> 00:09:43.889
sword to destroy homosexuality.
 

00:09:43.889 --> 00:09:48.489
Apart from blasphemy,
and the arrogance of a claim to

00:09:48.489 --> 00:09:52.426
know God's will,
what's most striking about

00:09:52.426 --> 00:09:57.200
Falwell's comment is his
complete ignorance of the facts

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.850
of epidemiology.
 

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:02.623
The virus is present in bodily
fluids: blood,

00:10:02.623 --> 00:10:06.139
semen, vaginal secretions,
breast milk.

00:10:06.139 --> 00:10:10.850
So, one means is certainly
sexual intercourse;

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.947
especially intercourse
involving an infected partner

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:19.768
where there are lesions that
allow the virus to penetrate the

00:10:19.768 --> 00:10:22.580
skin and enter the bloodstream.
 

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.110
Hence sex, heterosexual or
homosexual,

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.948
where there's a pre-existing
venereal infection such as

00:10:31.948 --> 00:10:35.491
herpes,
is particularly dangerous,

00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:41.470
or sex that causes abrasions,
such as anal intercourse.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:47.360
The risk factor is not
homosexuality but promiscuity,

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.341
by which I would define as sex
outside the context of a loving

00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:56.192
relationship,
whether heterosexual or

00:10:56.192 --> 00:10:57.519
homosexual.
 

00:10:57.519 --> 00:11:01.251
In Africa today,
it has been established

00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:06.995
epidemiologically that multiple
partner sex behaviors account

00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:10.918
for two-thirds of all new
infections.

00:11:10.918 --> 00:11:16.072
But AIDS can be transmitted in
other ways, despite what Jerry

00:11:16.072 --> 00:11:17.360
Falwell said.
 

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.479
It can be transmitted through
the blood by shared needles and

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:26.490
syringes, for example,
needles that haven't been

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.048
sterilized but are shared.
 

00:11:29.048 --> 00:11:32.480
One thinks of injecting drug
users.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:37.480
One can think also of patients
in resource poor health systems,

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.240
in which needles are scarce and
not routinely sterilized.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:46.029
One can think also of unsafe
blood supplies;

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:50.933
blood that isn't screened,
and is supplied to people by

00:11:50.933 --> 00:11:55.998
people who are remunerated,
thereby making every

00:11:55.998 --> 00:12:00.908
transfusion a risk for HIV
transmission,

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:06.778
for patients who have surgery,
or for hemophiliacs.

00:12:06.778 --> 00:12:10.889
Another factor,
of course, is the sex industry,

00:12:10.889 --> 00:12:15.892
where the disease spreads
rampantly among sex workers and

00:12:15.892 --> 00:12:17.500
their clients.
 

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.267
And then there's vertical
transmission,

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:24.440
a real shock to Jerry Falwell.
 

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:30.100
The disease can be transmitted
transplacentally from mother to

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.740
fetus, or from mother to infant
via breast milk.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:39.450
This is one of the drivers of
the present day pandemic.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:45.850
In 2008, the latest statistics,
children constituted just under

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.980
twenty percent of all new
infections,

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:55.570
and nearly the same percentage
of AIDS-related mortality.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.658
Well what about the
epidemiology of this pandemic?

00:13:00.658 --> 00:13:05.908
We're now a quarter of a
century into the global AIDS

00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:07.019
epidemic.
 

00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:11.712
And I would argue that AIDS is
a good example of one of the

00:13:11.712 --> 00:13:16.081
themes with which we began our
course: whether epidemic

00:13:16.081 --> 00:13:20.288
diseases are part of the big
picture of history.

00:13:20.288 --> 00:13:23.058
I would argue that you wouldn't
be able,

00:13:23.058 --> 00:13:26.663
in the future,
to write the history of the

00:13:26.663 --> 00:13:31.940
late-twentieth and twenty-first
centuries without devoting an

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:37.038
ample space to the AIDS pandemic
and its consequences.

00:13:37.038 --> 00:13:41.240
From the standpoint of the
industrial world--

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:45.274
Western Europe,
North America--some people have

00:13:45.274 --> 00:13:50.799
a comforting illusion that the
emergency has been controlled;

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:52.418
for a couple of reasons.
 

00:13:52.418 --> 00:13:57.101
One is the fact that the number
of cases in the developed world

00:13:57.101 --> 00:14:00.495
has leveled off;
except that in the last few

00:14:00.495 --> 00:14:03.664
years there have been some
troubling signs,

00:14:03.664 --> 00:14:07.058
including right here in the
United States.

00:14:07.058 --> 00:14:10.618
And secondly,
there's been the development of

00:14:10.618 --> 00:14:14.743
expensive drug cocktails that
have reduced mortality

00:14:14.743 --> 00:14:18.974
significantly,
with many patients experiencing

00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:21.928
the disease as a chronic
illness.

00:14:21.928 --> 00:14:27.019
But we need to be very careful
about complacency.

00:14:27.019 --> 00:14:31.748
There are only seven countries
in the world that have more

00:14:31.748 --> 00:14:35.730
cases of HIV infection than the
United States.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:42.221
In 2006, there were 1.2 million
people living with HIV in the

00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:47.089
United States,
and the number is not declining

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:48.279
at all.
 

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:51.942
Furthermore,
we need to remember that living

00:14:51.942 --> 00:14:57.480
with HIV as a chronic disease is
itself enormously problematic.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.340
It means an expensive and
complicated regimen of pills,

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:07.019
and the medication itself is
toxic and has unpleasant

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:08.548
side-effects.
 

00:15:08.548 --> 00:15:14.080
The evidence seems to suggest
too that patients with HIV-AIDS,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.412
under treatment,
experience nevertheless a

00:15:17.412 --> 00:15:21.639
significantly higher incidence
of other diseases,

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:26.139
and that they die at a
significantly lower age.

00:15:26.139 --> 00:15:32.755
And then very disturbingly,
since 2004 there's been a real

00:15:32.755 --> 00:15:39.490
spike in HIV infections among
men who have sex with men.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:45.450
Meanwhile, worldwide the
pandemic continues.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.894
In the words of the UNAIDS
Report for 2008,

00:15:49.894 --> 00:15:54.340
it was continuing at a
staggering level.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:58.937
At the end of 2007,
the World Health Organization

00:15:58.937 --> 00:16:04.303
reported globally that 33
million people were affected by

00:16:04.303 --> 00:16:08.568
HIV/AIDS;
that there were 4.5 million new

00:16:08.568 --> 00:16:14.121
infections during that year,
and during that dreadful year

00:16:14.121 --> 00:16:17.240
nearly 3 million AIDS deaths.
 

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:22.658
That's something like 8,200
people a day.

00:16:22.658 --> 00:16:29.070
2006 also witnessed 4.3 million
new infections.

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:34.428
In 2007 and '08,
the number of deaths decreased,

00:16:34.428 --> 00:16:39.210
and that was partly due to the
increased access to therapy,

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:44.620
antiretroviral therapy,
that lowered mortality.

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:50.279
In 2010, for the first time,
UNAIDS suggested some reasons

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:54.152
for optimism,
but optimism of a strictly

00:16:54.152 --> 00:16:55.840
limited kind.
 

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.761
Not that progress was being
made to controlling and

00:16:59.761 --> 00:17:03.683
decreasing the epidemic,
but that it seemed to have

00:17:03.683 --> 00:17:04.940
leveled off.
 

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:10.964
That was one of the hopeful
stories of the UN Report of this

00:17:10.964 --> 00:17:11.680
year.
 

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:16.326
It remains true though that
most people in resource-poor

00:17:16.326 --> 00:17:21.650
countries who need retroviral
therapy still don't receive it.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.990
But let's look at some of the
graphs.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:32.714
This was HIV at the end of
2005, and it shows the total of

00:17:32.714 --> 00:17:37.730
40.3 million people with
HIV/AIDS,

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:45.765
and below that it shows the
numbers of newly infected people

00:17:45.765 --> 00:17:51.348
and the number of AIDS deaths
for 2005.

00:17:51.348 --> 00:17:58.875
And this gives you some idea of
the dramatic inequality of the

00:17:58.875 --> 00:18:05.584
burden of HIV/AIDS,
that it's enormously a burden

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:12.349
in Sub-Saharan Africa,
which has more than half of the

00:18:12.349 --> 00:18:17.038
total number of AIDS people in
the world.

00:18:17.038 --> 00:18:21.678
Or let's look at this picture,
which just gives a clear

00:18:21.678 --> 00:18:25.800
indication of where the
epicenter of the AIDS is,

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:31.441
which is in Southern Africa;
countries such as Botswana,

00:18:31.441 --> 00:18:35.832
Lesotho, Swaziland,
Namibia, South Africa,

00:18:35.832 --> 00:18:39.259
Zimbabwe, Angola,
Mozambique.

00:18:39.259 --> 00:18:44.707
There the WHO reported in 2006,
and again in 2008,

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:50.933
that the epidemic was still
rampant, that the trend still

00:18:50.933 --> 00:18:53.380
offers no comfort.
 

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.807
And in the sub-region as a
whole, life expectancy has

00:18:57.807 --> 00:19:00.701
actually declined,
because of AIDS,

00:19:00.701 --> 00:19:05.851
to below fifty;
plunging to levels not seen

00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:08.990
indeed since the 1950s.
 

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:14.910
Swaziland and Botswana have the
unhappy distinction of having

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.348
the world's highest prevalence
of HIV/AIDS.

00:19:19.348 --> 00:19:22.990
And here you see the worst-case
scenario.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.613
Twenty-six percent of people
are infected with HIV,

00:19:27.613 --> 00:19:32.605
the highest levels ever
recorded, as are twenty percent

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:34.640
of pregnant women.
 

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.384
Those are rates of prevalence
that the Center for Disease

00:19:39.384 --> 00:19:42.858
Control once thought to be
impossible,

00:19:42.858 --> 00:19:49.068
and life expectancy at birth
dropped below forty years in

00:19:49.068 --> 00:19:52.838
several countries in the region.
 

00:19:52.838 --> 00:19:56.509
With nearly 6 million people
living with HIV,

00:19:56.509 --> 00:20:01.775
in 2008, South Africa has the
sad record of possessing the

00:20:01.775 --> 00:20:07.039
largest HIV epidemic in the
world in absolute numbers,

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.960
not though per capita.
 

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:15.914
Now, epidemiologically it now
seems that there are two great

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:20.660
divergent patterns in this
terrible epidemic.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:25.118
In the industrial world,
it's primarily an affliction of

00:20:25.118 --> 00:20:26.660
high-risk groups.
 

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.419
We'll talk about them in a
moment: men who have sex with

00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:32.160
men;
sex workers;

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.808
injecting drug users.
 

00:20:37.808 --> 00:20:41.807
This is what the World Health
Organization calls

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:44.701
"concentrated
epidemics,"

00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:48.019
in which the pandemic is
confined,

00:20:48.019 --> 00:20:52.140
above overwhelmingly,
to certain high-risk groups.

00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:55.970
But there's a second and more
devastating pattern,

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.509
clearly evident in southern
Africa,

00:20:59.509 --> 00:21:03.710
where HIV/AIDS is a leading
cause of death,

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.759
and where transmission among
high-risk groups certainly

00:21:07.759 --> 00:21:10.714
occurs,
but it's overwhelmed by

00:21:10.714 --> 00:21:14.548
transmission in the general
population.

00:21:14.548 --> 00:21:20.257
There transmission is primarily
through heterosexual sex,

00:21:20.257 --> 00:21:25.660
and significantly more women
are infected than men.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.074
And it's also true,
as I've said,

00:21:28.074 --> 00:21:31.470
that transmission occurs on a
large scale,

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:34.608
vertically from mother to
unborn child,

00:21:34.608 --> 00:21:39.141
so that significant numbers of
children are born with

00:21:39.141 --> 00:21:40.710
congenital AIDS.
 

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.259
Why women?
 

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:47.782
And this is again one of the
themes of our course,

00:21:47.782 --> 00:21:51.936
and I'll be dealing in part
here with poverty,

00:21:51.936 --> 00:21:55.630
and not just poverty but
inequality.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.558
Women, in part,
because of biology.

00:21:58.558 --> 00:22:03.501
The disease is more easily
transmitted from men to women

00:22:03.501 --> 00:22:05.118
than vice-versa.
 

00:22:05.118 --> 00:22:09.136
It's also true,
clearly true in Sub-Saharan

00:22:09.136 --> 00:22:14.303
Africa, that sexual activity
tends to start earlier for

00:22:14.303 --> 00:22:15.259
women.
 

00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:20.500
Young women in many parts of
Sub-Saharan Africa also

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:25.328
frequently have sex with much
older partners.

00:22:25.328 --> 00:22:30.880
Sexual inequality also fuels
the sex industry,

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:38.410
as does--the epidemic is primed
also by violence against women,

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:43.538
and often the inability of
women in many situations to

00:22:43.538 --> 00:22:46.538
negotiate safe sex practices.
 

00:22:46.538 --> 00:22:50.739
In many parts of the world
girls are simply severely

00:22:50.739 --> 00:22:54.608
discriminated against in terms
of education,

00:22:54.608 --> 00:22:58.971
and therefore do not acquire
sex education and knowledge

00:22:58.971 --> 00:23:03.492
necessary to take effective
measures to protect themselves

00:23:03.492 --> 00:23:06.269
and control their reproduction.
 

00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:11.181
Girls who have not received
primary school education are

00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:16.449
twice as likely to be infected
with HIV as those with higher

00:23:16.449 --> 00:23:18.950
educational attainments.
 

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:23.128
And as I said,
violence against women is a

00:23:23.128 --> 00:23:26.288
major factor in the epidemic.
 

00:23:26.288 --> 00:23:31.115
It's also true that we need to
mention cultural norms in these

00:23:31.115 --> 00:23:34.835
areas where notions of
masculinity are important

00:23:34.835 --> 00:23:39.582
determinants of male behavior
patterns that increase the risk

00:23:39.582 --> 00:23:43.601
of AIDS;
the idea that it's meritorious

00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:48.940
to have multiple partners,
and unmanly to use condoms.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:53.411
Well, this is an epidemic that
can serve also as a review for

00:23:53.411 --> 00:23:56.019
some of the themes of our
course.

00:23:56.019 --> 00:24:00.868
We see this epidemic being
primed by a number of factors

00:24:00.868 --> 00:24:06.160
that by now are familiar to you,
in comparative discourse.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.568
There's a clear link with
poverty.

00:24:09.568 --> 00:24:13.945
The countries with uncontrolled
epidemics are among the poorest

00:24:13.945 --> 00:24:18.640
nations in the world,
and poverty is directly linked

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.140
with the epidemiology of
HIV/AIDS.

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:26.117
Poverty prevents national
governments from building

00:24:26.117 --> 00:24:30.018
effective public health
structures, or educational

00:24:30.018 --> 00:24:31.608
infrastructures.
 

00:24:31.608 --> 00:24:35.733
And studies of sectors most at
risk from the epidemic in

00:24:35.733 --> 00:24:39.525
southern Africa--
that is, sexually active young

00:24:39.525 --> 00:24:43.390
people in the fifteen to
twenty-five age group--

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:48.204
those studies reveal that large
numbers of people of that age

00:24:48.204 --> 00:24:52.619
group still do not have an
accurate understanding of the

00:24:52.619 --> 00:24:55.509
mechanisms of AIDS transmission.
 

00:24:55.509 --> 00:25:00.070
Local studies also show in some
places the disturbingly large

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.338
numbers of sexually active young
people--

00:25:03.338 --> 00:25:06.818
twenty-five percent have been
discovered in places--

00:25:06.818 --> 00:25:12.670
still have no idea of what a
condom is.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:18.255
Poverty prevents people from
having access to means to defend

00:25:18.255 --> 00:25:23.096
themselves: education,
medical care and treatment for

00:25:23.096 --> 00:25:25.608
those already infected.
 

00:25:25.608 --> 00:25:29.788
It drives recruitment into the
sex industry,

00:25:29.788 --> 00:25:33.578
another major driver of the
pandemic.

00:25:33.578 --> 00:25:38.868
It leads to unemployment,
demoralization and alienation;

00:25:38.868 --> 00:25:44.767
all of which fuel high-risk
behavior, including intravenous

00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:51.578
drug use, and that in turn leads
to further unsafe sex practices.

00:25:51.578 --> 00:25:54.605
Then there's the social and
economic impact,

00:25:54.605 --> 00:25:58.193
which is maximized by the age
profile of the victims

00:25:58.193 --> 00:26:02.188
themselves;
that is, young men and women in

00:26:02.188 --> 00:26:06.737
the prime of life,
who should be the mainstays of

00:26:06.737 --> 00:26:09.769
families and their economies.
 

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:15.117
In some places poverty even
destroys the effects of sex

00:26:15.117 --> 00:26:17.000
education itself.
 

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.430
In Uganda, for example,
the newspaper the Uganda

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:25.269
Monitor,
reported two years ago that

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:30.938
condoms remained so far beyond
the means of many people that a

00:26:30.938 --> 00:26:36.980
widespread practice was to boil
them after use and reuse them.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.788
Then another theme in our
course.

00:26:39.788 --> 00:26:44.009
We've talked about urbanization
and its role with certain

00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:48.167
diseases;
not all, malaria was clearly

00:26:48.167 --> 00:26:50.068
very different.
 

00:26:50.068 --> 00:26:53.950
But it's no coincidence that
southern Africa,

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:58.769
where the pandemic is rampant,
is also rapidly,

00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:03.877
rapidly urbanizing,
and that indeed twenty percent

00:27:03.877 --> 00:27:09.923
of the global burden of HIV/AIDS
falls on fifteen cities in

00:27:09.923 --> 00:27:12.009
southern Africa.
 

00:27:12.009 --> 00:27:16.790
Another theme of our course is
represented by AIDS,

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:21.000
and that's the impact of
conflict and war.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.226
The movement of troops once
again has proved to be ideal for

00:27:26.226 --> 00:27:31.009
sexually transmitted diseases,
and for prostitution.

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:34.671
And the spread of other
STDs--syphilis,

00:27:34.671 --> 00:27:40.548
gonorrhea and herpes--actually
furthers the spread of AIDS.

00:27:40.548 --> 00:27:46.086
The lesions that they cause,
like genital ulcers,

00:27:46.086 --> 00:27:52.430
provide ideal portals for entry
of HIV into the body.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:56.460
Trade and modern means of
transport have been important.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:01.992
One can't understand the AIDS
epidemic without roads,

00:28:01.992 --> 00:28:04.759
railroads, the airplane.
 

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:09.048
Societal neglect is a theme
we've talked about,

00:28:09.048 --> 00:28:13.672
and national governments,
in some cases nations that are

00:28:13.672 --> 00:28:18.462
poor and under-developed and
have virtual status as almost

00:28:18.462 --> 00:28:22.051
failed states,
have been incapable of taking

00:28:22.051 --> 00:28:26.721
major initiatives on their own,
in terms of improving the

00:28:26.721 --> 00:28:29.509
health of their populations.
 

00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:34.348
But in some cases they also
have other priorities.

00:28:34.348 --> 00:28:38.910
There's the siren song of
military spending.

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:40.769
There's corruption.
 

00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:44.566
Or let's take the case of the
former president of South

00:28:44.566 --> 00:28:47.953
Africa,
Mbeki, who refused to take

00:28:47.953 --> 00:28:53.574
science seriously,
and rejected the idea that the

00:28:53.574 --> 00:28:56.298
HIV virus causes AIDS.
 

00:28:56.298 --> 00:29:01.670
He called on people not to use
condoms, but simply to drink a

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:07.220
mixture of olive oil and garlic
as a prophylactic of choice.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:13.143
So, there's been a current of
AIDS dissidents who reject the

00:29:13.143 --> 00:29:17.259
link between the virus and the
disease.

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:22.920
Fortunately,
that situation has changed.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.621
Then there's stigmatization,
which is a cause of the spread

00:29:27.621 --> 00:29:29.078
of the epidemic.
 

00:29:29.078 --> 00:29:33.670
It causes people at risk not to
seek medical attention,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:38.406
and that in turn undermines
surveillance and active

00:29:38.406 --> 00:29:43.240
understanding of the
epidemiology of the disease.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:49.111
And the inequality of women who
are stigmatized has a number of

00:29:49.111 --> 00:29:52.519
structural consequences:
that is,

00:29:52.519 --> 00:29:58.130
in terms of inheritance laws
that disenfranchise them;

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.700
unequal jobs in the economy;
violence;

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:08.541
early sexual debut;
and large-spread practices of

00:30:08.541 --> 00:30:13.970
what UNAIDS calls
"transactional sex."

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:19.373
In Kenya, for example,
teenage girls are three times

00:30:19.373 --> 00:30:26.259
more likely to be infected with
HIV than boys of the same age,

00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:28.859
and the differential,
instead of decreasing,

00:30:28.859 --> 00:30:32.670
increases with age.
 

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:42.150
There's also the displacement
of people, and HIV/AIDS thrives

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:48.313
on migrant labor,
on disrupted families,

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:51.788
on refugee status.
 

00:30:51.788 --> 00:30:55.170
And in industries where
migrants live,

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.375
for example,
among miners,

00:30:57.375 --> 00:31:03.019
in compounds at vast distances
from their homes and families,

00:31:03.019 --> 00:31:09.130
a situation that leads to the
thriving of commercial sex.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:14.940
Mobile populations are at high
risk of infection.

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:20.519
And then one of the vicious
factors of HIV/AIDS is the

00:31:20.519 --> 00:31:26.094
burden of the disease itself,
which causes the burden of

00:31:26.094 --> 00:31:30.105
poverty to increase,
and poverty furthers the

00:31:30.105 --> 00:31:31.000
epidemic.
 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.842
AIDS then leads to a vicious
downward spiral in which poverty

00:31:35.842 --> 00:31:39.069
creates favorable conditions for
AIDS.

00:31:39.069 --> 00:31:42.200
AIDS breeds poverty, and so on.
 

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:46.529
In the words of the UNAIDS
Report for 2008:

00:31:46.529 --> 00:31:52.818
"HIV causes a greater loss
of productivity than any other

00:31:52.818 --> 00:31:56.798
disease,
and is likely to push an

00:31:56.798 --> 00:32:02.740
additional 6 million households
into poverty by 2015.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:07.663
HIV has inflicted the single
greatest reversal in human

00:32:07.663 --> 00:32:11.130
development in modern
history."

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.640
That was the UN Report.
 

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.500
And then there is
super-infection;

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:22.950
that is, multiple infections
with different strains of AIDS.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:28.336
And one of the most tragic
factors of all is the phenomenon

00:32:28.336 --> 00:32:30.009
of AIDS orphans.
 

00:32:30.009 --> 00:32:37.279
The WHO reports staggering
numbers of them.

00:32:37.279 --> 00:32:42.440
It terms it "a crisis of
gargantuan proportions."

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:48.088
Already in Sub-Saharan Africa,
11 million children under

00:32:48.088 --> 00:32:52.607
fifteen are orphans;
a number that's expected,

00:32:52.607 --> 00:32:57.577
given current and projected
prevalence of HIV infection,

00:32:57.577 --> 00:33:03.269
to reach the staggering figure
of 25 million in a few years.

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:07.205
In the worst infected cases,
it could be,

00:33:07.205 --> 00:33:13.210
if this actually materializes,
that one child in five could be

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.078
an AIDS orphan.
 

00:33:15.078 --> 00:33:21.269
What are the effects of this
dreadful pandemic on societies?

00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:26.638
Again we see that this
functions almost as a review of

00:33:26.638 --> 00:33:28.970
themes of our course.
 

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:33.633
Clearly no one would be able to
write the history of the present

00:33:33.633 --> 00:33:37.704
moment in southern Africa
without giving a central place

00:33:37.704 --> 00:33:38.890
to HIV/AIDS.
 

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:43.868
HIV/AIDS prevents education and
literacy.

00:33:43.868 --> 00:33:48.766
At the heart of the epidemic in
Botswana is the fact that the

00:33:48.766 --> 00:33:52.929
disease kills teachers more
rapidly than they can be

00:33:52.929 --> 00:33:55.637
replaced;
that poor families,

00:33:55.637 --> 00:34:00.582
with a member ill from AIDS,
can't afford to send children

00:34:00.582 --> 00:34:01.710
to school.
 

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:05.650
The fact that it destroys
healthcare systems.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:10.887
In many countries in southern
Africa fifty percent of all

00:34:10.887 --> 00:34:14.630
hospitalizations are due to
HIV/AIDS,

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:20.384
and nearly all other healthcare
interventions and programs have

00:34:20.384 --> 00:34:24.840
therefore been erased or
radically downscaled.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:29.650
It destroys productivity and
creates a crippling burden of

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.389
disease,
destroys families and

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:36.438
communities, thereby trapping
whole countries in

00:34:36.438 --> 00:34:40.659
underdevelopment and
international dependency.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:46.130
It destroys civil society and
undermines democracy.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:51.012
It's the substratum for a
lethal epidemic that follows in

00:34:51.012 --> 00:34:53.835
its wake,
the reemergence of

00:34:53.835 --> 00:34:57.585
tuberculosis,
the classic opportunistic

00:34:57.585 --> 00:35:01.039
infection complicating HIV/AIDS.
 

00:35:01.039 --> 00:35:06.226
And TB is rising at a rate of
six percent per annum in

00:35:06.226 --> 00:35:10.824
southern Africa,
where 2 million cases of TB are

00:35:10.824 --> 00:35:12.880
diagnosed a year.
 

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.320
Businesses find that they're
crippled.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.610
There are high rates of
absenteeism.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:24.159
There's a real shortage of
skilled workers available.

00:35:24.159 --> 00:35:28.300
There are high rates of
turnover, and it's extremely

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.980
expensive to train new workers.
 

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:34.550
And, of course,
the rocketing healthcare

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.929
expenses that they face.
 

00:35:36.929 --> 00:35:40.940
There's a major cultural impact
on societies.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:47.905
Clearly this undermines any
confident sense that a society

00:35:47.905 --> 00:35:50.349
is protecting one.
 

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:53.630
There's a demographic impact.
 

00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:58.838
We've already seen the way in
which HIV/AIDS is altering the

00:35:58.838 --> 00:36:03.253
age structure of whole
populations and transforming

00:36:03.253 --> 00:36:05.018
life expectancy.
 

00:36:05.018 --> 00:36:09.577
And there's even the
possibility of failed states as

00:36:09.577 --> 00:36:14.527
a direct result of disease,
with enormous implications for

00:36:14.527 --> 00:36:17.679
security,
political stability and

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:18.789
democracy.
 

00:36:18.789 --> 00:36:24.755
But this last fact
paradoxically has also opened a

00:36:24.755 --> 00:36:26.460
ray of hope.
 

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:32.552
The realization that I last
mentioned affected the national

00:36:32.552 --> 00:36:37.070
security estimate of our own
government,

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:42.143
which reckoned that in fact
HIV/AIDS was a major threat to

00:36:42.143 --> 00:36:45.349
the security of the United
States;

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:51.233
the first time that disease was
recognized by the CIA and the

00:36:51.233 --> 00:36:55.940
security community as a threat
to our country.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.440
And this was reinforced by
studies by, for example,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.510
the RAND Corporation.
 

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:07.786
The result of this realization,
that we are indeed a global

00:37:07.786 --> 00:37:11.257
community,
and that what's happening in

00:37:11.257 --> 00:37:16.485
Southern Africa and other places
is of enormous impact throughout

00:37:16.485 --> 00:37:21.269
the world,
led to a massive investment of

00:37:21.269 --> 00:37:22.119
funds.
 

00:37:22.119 --> 00:37:28.286
And I'd most like to mention
PEPFAR, the President's

00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:34.815
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief,
that was established by

00:37:34.815 --> 00:37:38.079
President Bush in 2004.
 

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:43.146
It now targets fifteen
countries, has been extended

00:37:43.146 --> 00:37:47.130
under President Obama,
and those countries are

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:49.400
primarily, though not
exclusively,

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.610
in southern Africa.
 

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:56.519
Initially it was fifteen
billion dollars over several

00:37:56.519 --> 00:38:00.340
years,
and has been renewed since,

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:06.059
and it became the largest
commitment of funding to an

00:38:06.059 --> 00:38:11.010
international health effort ever
recorded.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:16.416
This has led with the--there's
also funds through the Gates

00:38:16.416 --> 00:38:20.889
Foundation particularly directed
at research,

00:38:20.889 --> 00:38:25.010
and through the Global Fund for
HIV/AIDS,

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.010
Malaria and Tuberculosis.
 

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.909
One of the conclusions is that
there's been--

00:38:31.909 --> 00:38:35.750
that we could reach--is that in
the last years,

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:40.971
under this massive new
investment of effort and

00:38:40.971 --> 00:38:45.143
funding,
that the world health community

00:38:45.143 --> 00:38:49.954
is developing much more
sophisticated strategies for

00:38:49.954 --> 00:38:54.869
dealing with this epidemic,
that it has much more data and

00:38:54.869 --> 00:38:57.400
information,
and that it's learned a number

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.909
of important,
indeed vital, lessons.

00:38:59.909 --> 00:39:04.679
What are some of the
conclusions that provide us with

00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:07.340
at least a measure of hope?
 

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:12.644
One of them is that in
campaigns against this disease,

00:39:12.644 --> 00:39:16.550
one size definitely does not
fit all.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:20.643
And here we see another theme
of our course,

00:39:20.643 --> 00:39:24.547
that information,
hard data, is absolutely

00:39:24.547 --> 00:39:29.500
crucial to any effective public
health strategy.

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:34.820
Public health needs to be based
on a solid basis of information,

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:39.777
and in this case we see a rapid
up-scaling of testing and

00:39:39.777 --> 00:39:45.177
surveillance as one of the key
components of the global effort

00:39:45.177 --> 00:39:47.480
to combat the disease.
 

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.295
That's necessary because it
establishes the clear idea that

00:39:52.295 --> 00:39:57.860
the epidemiology of this disease
in each society is distinctive,

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.512
and that in turn enables the
campaign to concentrate

00:40:02.512 --> 00:40:05.659
resources,
to change tactics,

00:40:05.659 --> 00:40:12.300
depending on the actual results
of the interventions so far.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.744
So, you need to be able to,
in order to have sound public

00:40:15.744 --> 00:40:18.639
health,
scientifically to assess what

00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:22.677
you've done to date,
and to change course if it's

00:40:22.677 --> 00:40:24.489
not working properly.
 

00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:29.539
One of the hopeful signs in the
AIDS pandemic is that the

00:40:29.539 --> 00:40:34.320
campaign has become more
sophisticated and focused.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.610
It has been realized that
strategies that fit one phase in

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:42.976
the history of the epidemic may
not be effective at another

00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:43.730
stage.
 

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:48.791
And, so, the response has
continually to be updated and

00:40:48.791 --> 00:40:49.730
adapted.
 

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:55.204
The priority now is to clearly
identify high burden areas as a

00:40:55.204 --> 00:41:00.320
priority, and to saturate them
with prevention efforts.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.989
The slogan of PEPFAR,
for this reason,

00:41:03.989 --> 00:41:07.559
is "Know Your
Epidemic."

00:41:07.559 --> 00:41:09.706
In the past,
for example,

00:41:09.706 --> 00:41:14.630
anti-AIDS programs failed to
target married couples,

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.250
and people in long-term
relationships,

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:23.965
couples in which one partner in
particular is HIV-positive while

00:41:23.965 --> 00:41:27.664
the other is not;
in the jargon of the World

00:41:27.664 --> 00:41:31.690
Health Organization,
"discordant couples."

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:34.947
Another lesson,
that the commitment cannot be

00:41:34.947 --> 00:41:39.010
short-term;
that it must be sustained.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:43.954
That short-term interventions
that are then scaled back can be

00:41:43.954 --> 00:41:46.630
useless and counter-productive.
 

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:52.679
A good illustration is Uganda,
which a few years ago was one

00:41:52.679 --> 00:41:55.960
of the bright spots in Africa.
 

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.750
When the government invested
heavily in sex education,

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.342
in the provision of condoms,
and the fostering of new and

00:42:03.342 --> 00:42:06.737
healthy sexual behaviors,
the results were highly

00:42:06.737 --> 00:42:10.219
successful,
until funding was scaled back

00:42:10.219 --> 00:42:12.889
in favor of other priorities.
 

00:42:12.889 --> 00:42:15.967
And since then,
the epidemic in Uganda has

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:18.070
resurged with a vengeance.
 

00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:22.119
And one could say something
similar about Thailand.

00:42:22.119 --> 00:42:23.909
There are also new strategies.
 

00:42:23.909 --> 00:42:26.420
Let me give you a couple of
examples.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:32.652
One is the need to abolish the
distinction, in this pandemic,

00:42:32.652 --> 00:42:38.469
between prevention and
treatment as a false dichotomy.

00:42:38.469 --> 00:42:43.019
Because treatment with
antiretroviral therapy is in

00:42:43.019 --> 00:42:47.480
fact a valid and essential
preventive strategy.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:50.891
In particular,
antiretroviral therapy

00:42:50.891 --> 00:42:56.483
radically lowers the incidence
of vertical transmission from

00:42:56.483 --> 00:42:58.380
mother to child.
 

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:03.150
It's also true that
antiretroviral treatment lowers

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.586
the viral load,
and therefore reduces

00:43:06.586 --> 00:43:08.210
transmission.
 

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:12.916
Antiretroviral therapy is a
prophylactic because it prolongs

00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:16.827
the life of parents,
thereby decreasing the number

00:43:16.827 --> 00:43:19.940
of orphans and vulnerable
children;

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.815
the very people who fuel the
sex industry and are most likely

00:43:24.815 --> 00:43:28.960
to indulge in unsafe sex
practices because they lack

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.731
education,
resources and access to medical

00:43:33.731 --> 00:43:34.420
care.
 

00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:39.088
PEPFAR has concentrated
recently on making generic

00:43:39.088 --> 00:43:44.710
antiretroviral therapies
available in focused countries,

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:48.110
at an affordable price,
and the FDA,

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.157
in this country,
has established fast-track

00:43:52.157 --> 00:43:56.590
approval to allow
antiretrovirals to be rapidly

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:59.000
reviewed and cleared.
 

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.690
By the end of 2008,
antiretroviral therapy had been

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:08.099
extended to 10 million people
with HIV/AIDS,

00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:13.929
and especially to pregnant
women who are HIV-positive.

00:44:13.929 --> 00:44:16.268
Another hopeful sign.
 

00:44:16.268 --> 00:44:20.663
At first, PEPFAR was
ideologically motivated,

00:44:20.663 --> 00:44:26.253
and stipulated that one-third
of its funding had to go to

00:44:26.253 --> 00:44:29.250
abstinence-only education.
 

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:32.873
But this has been demonstrated
by results to be

00:44:32.873 --> 00:44:37.050
counterproductive and so has
largely been dropped,

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:42.355
and funding has been redirected
toward other aspects of the

00:44:42.355 --> 00:44:43.268
program.
 

00:44:43.268 --> 00:44:48.150
Another stress has been on
gender inequality.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:52.625
And here I want to stress that
it's not only poverty but

00:44:52.625 --> 00:44:56.449
inequality that drives this
epidemic forward.

00:44:56.449 --> 00:45:02.773
Let me give you the example of
Swaziland, which is at the

00:45:02.773 --> 00:45:06.050
epicenter of this pandemic.
 

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:10.690
One third of women in the
eighteen-to-twenty-four age

00:45:10.690 --> 00:45:15.333
group were found to have
experienced sexual violence,

00:45:15.333 --> 00:45:19.440
as had one quarter of girls
under fifteen.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.929
So, providing education and
re-education,

00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:28.771
stressing the dangers of power
differentials in intimate

00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:31.856
relationships,
has been important in

00:45:31.856 --> 00:45:36.463
demonstrating the devastating
consequences of sexual

00:45:36.463 --> 00:45:39.996
entitlement,
and also offering adolescent

00:45:39.996 --> 00:45:44.391
women vocational training so
that they would have the skills

00:45:44.391 --> 00:45:49.074
necessary in the marketplace,
and hence the economic

00:45:49.074 --> 00:45:55.139
independence that was a major
determinant of public health.

00:45:55.139 --> 00:45:59.635
Until recent years,
HIV/AIDS programs avoided what

00:45:59.635 --> 00:46:05.235
might be called socioeconomic
and cultural determinants of the

00:46:05.235 --> 00:46:08.652
pandemic,
concentrating on generic

00:46:08.652 --> 00:46:11.742
awareness,
but not confronting the

00:46:11.742 --> 00:46:16.489
specifics of local situations
that fuel the epidemic.

00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:21.981
Let me give you an example of
targeting specific high-burden

00:46:21.981 --> 00:46:23.750
groups and areas.
 

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:27.815
One of them has been in recent
years the targeting of

00:46:27.815 --> 00:46:31.972
intravenous drug users,
and removing ideological

00:46:31.972 --> 00:46:37.367
blinkers, and simply talking in
terms of epidemiology and hard

00:46:37.367 --> 00:46:41.422
science,
leading to such innovations as

00:46:41.422 --> 00:46:46.010
needle exchange programs to make
blood safe,

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:50.822
and indeed in a couple of
countries to opioid substitution

00:46:50.822 --> 00:46:55.047
treatments to remove,
or at least to downscale,

00:46:55.047 --> 00:46:59.922
heroin addiction,
thereby once again lowering the

00:46:59.922 --> 00:47:02.300
rates of transmission.
 

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:07.463
Another major intervention has
been on establishing safe blood

00:47:07.463 --> 00:47:11.099
supplies,
combating what we might call

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:14.750
the medical transmission of
HIV/AIDS,

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:17.750
through the establishment of
laboratories,

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:22.599
when with them the screening of
all blood and the recruitment of

00:47:22.599 --> 00:47:26.447
donors from low-risk sectors of
the population on a

00:47:26.447 --> 00:47:28.449
non-remunerated basis.
 

00:47:28.449 --> 00:47:33.971
Or there's been the awareness
of the utility of male

00:47:33.971 --> 00:47:40.250
circumcision as a prophylactic
measure in this pandemic.

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:46.429
Let me then just contrast the
situation in Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:47:46.429 --> 00:47:49.539
where the epidemic is,
in the population,

00:47:49.539 --> 00:47:54.505
the general population,
with a couple of other worrying

00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:59.565
places in the world--
and I'll end then on a slightly

00:47:59.565 --> 00:48:04.351
more somber note--
some places that are currently

00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:08.630
sources of concern,
outside of Africa.

00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:13.092
There's Eastern Europe,
and the former areas of the

00:48:13.092 --> 00:48:16.842
Soviet Union,
where UNAIDS has talked about

00:48:16.842 --> 00:48:21.929
an emerging epidemic,
unlike that of Southern Africa.

00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:24.780
The epidemic has a different
profile.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:29.161
It's a concentrated epidemic,
showing prevalence among

00:48:29.161 --> 00:48:33.130
high-risk groups,
like intravenous drug users.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:37.070
In Saint Petersburg,
thirty percent of intravenous

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:40.449
drug users are under
nineteen-years-of-age,

00:48:40.449 --> 00:48:43.909
and the sharing of needles is
the norm.

00:48:43.909 --> 00:48:47.210
And it's also driven by the sex
industry,

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:51.530
and by the collapse of the
healthcare system,

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:57.043
and fueled also by some
religious attitudes which scorn

00:48:57.043 --> 00:49:01.130
sex education and the use of
condoms,

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:04.724
or devote resources to a
practice of abstinence

00:49:04.724 --> 00:49:08.317
education,
which has demonstrably not

00:49:08.317 --> 00:49:09.110
worked.
 

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:12.260
Or there's East Asia and the
Pacific;

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:15.581
again, injecting drug use,
sex industry,

00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:20.434
low condom use and sexual
tourism, all of these being risk

00:49:20.434 --> 00:49:23.159
factors that are cumulative.
 

00:49:23.159 --> 00:49:27.661
I'll conclude just with a
couple of worrying points about

00:49:27.661 --> 00:49:29.110
our own country.
 

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:34.639
The outbreak began in the '80s,
as far as we know,

00:49:34.639 --> 00:49:40.059
peaked around 1993,
and then declined steeply until

00:49:40.059 --> 00:49:46.030
approximately the year 2001,
since which time there's been

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:50.157
an upturn;
and a surprising degree of

00:49:50.157 --> 00:49:53.659
misinformation has abounded.
 

00:49:53.659 --> 00:49:57.965
New infections,
we can see, demonstrate that

00:49:57.965 --> 00:50:01.670
the epidemic has been
transformed,

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:06.331
and the epidemic in the United
States is totally unlike what's

00:50:06.331 --> 00:50:08.699
happening in Southern Africa.
 

00:50:08.699 --> 00:50:13.230
New infections are
overwhelmingly among men;

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:19.909
718,000 males affected and
160,000 women.

00:50:19.909 --> 00:50:23.228
And it tends to be among
concentrated groups:

00:50:23.228 --> 00:50:26.409
men who have sex with men;
drug users;

00:50:26.409 --> 00:50:30.050
and ethnic
minorities--African-Americans,

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:34.782
who have half of the new cases
in the last few years,

00:50:34.782 --> 00:50:36.420
and Hispanics.
 

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:38.510
A transformation occurred.
 

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:43.784
AIDS in the 1980s was primarily
a disease among the white

00:50:43.784 --> 00:50:45.010
population.
 

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:49.536
It has since declined among
whites, and spread disturbingly

00:50:49.536 --> 00:50:53.063
among minorities;
African-Americans,

00:50:53.063 --> 00:50:55.559
Hispanics and Asians.
 

00:50:55.559 --> 00:50:58.817
So, at that point I'll refer
you to Wednesday,

00:50:58.817 --> 00:51:03.159
when we'll talk about the
United States in greater detail.

00:51:03.159 --> 00:51:06.471
And I'll just conclude,
since I've run out of time,

00:51:06.471 --> 00:51:10.710
by saying that the pandemic at
the moment is extremely active.

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:14.463
The most hopeful thing I could
say to you is not that it's

00:51:14.463 --> 00:51:17.099
being controlled,
but that it seems to be

00:51:17.099 --> 00:51:20.335
globally stabilized;
but there are a number of

00:51:20.335 --> 00:51:24.179
really worrying places in the
world, and some very worrying

00:51:24.179 --> 00:51:25.239
developments.
 

00:51:25.239 --> 00:51:30.000

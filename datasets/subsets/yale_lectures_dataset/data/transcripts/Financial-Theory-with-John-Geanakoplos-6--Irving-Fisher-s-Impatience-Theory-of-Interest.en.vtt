00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.554
Prof: All right,
so we spent a long time

00:00:03.554 --> 00:00:06.946
reviewing general equilibrium
and we've now switched to

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:09.353
finance,
and you're hopefully going to

00:00:09.353 --> 00:00:12.661
see that the principles of
finance emerge very quickly from

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:15.000
the principles of general
equilibrium.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.149
So that although it seems it
was a long interlude we've

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.240
actually learned a lot about the
financial economy.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.963
So I'm going to continue with
the example that we started with

00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:25.940
the last time.
 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.200
So we have a financial economy.
 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.090
So in a financial economy--what
is a financial economy?

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.201
On this top board the financial
economy is defined by lots of

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:39.950
people in the economy and their
utilities.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.075
So here we have for simplicity
two kinds of people A and B with

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:47.403
utilities given by the log
X_1 1 half log

00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:49.200
X_2 etcetera.
 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.061
It's also people know today
what their endowments are and

00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:57.130
they have some idea of what
they're going to be tomorrow.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.115
They're labor powered today and
they're going to be able to work

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:00.969
again next year.
 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.453
So the labor endowments are
given by (1,1) for A,

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:08.510
and (1,0) for B.
 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.186
And then they also know that
there are two stocks in the

00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:13.766
economy and they have to
anticipate what the dividends

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:14.739
are going to be.
 

00:01:14.739 --> 00:01:17.340
And as Fisher said,
the main value of assets is

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.450
that they give you something,
they produce something.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.822
In this case they're going to
be dividends and beta's

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:25.349
producing dividends of 2,
and alpha is producing a

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:29.331
dividend of 1 next period,
and then the ownership of

00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:30.140
shares.
 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.971
So that's the beginning of the
economy and we want to define

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:37.152
from that equilibrium which
involves: what are the

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:39.750
contemporaneous prices going to
be,

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.364
that's Q for contemporaneous,
what are the prices of the

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:45.535
stocks going to be,
and who's going to hold which

00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:50.120
portfolio of assets of stocks,
and who's going to consume what.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.590
And so Fisher said that's a
very complicated problem.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.012
You can simplify it by looking
at a general equilibrium problem

00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:00.578
which is much shorter to
describe.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:03.408
And so the general equilibrium
economy is going to be a much

00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:04.078
simpler one.
 

00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:08.590
It's going to consist of U^(A)
and U^(B) the same as before,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.770
and E-hat^(A)_1,
the endowments,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.147
E-hat^(A)_2 and
(E-hat^(B)_1

00:02:18.147 --> 00:02:21.008
E-hat^(B)_2).
 

00:02:21.008 --> 00:02:27.307
So we've left out half the
variables up there and we define

00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:32.520
E-hat^(A)_1 =
E^(A)_1 = 1 and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.060
E-hat^(B)_1 =
E^(B)_1 = 1,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.355
but E-hat^(A)_2 (this
is the Fisher insight) =

00:02:44.355 --> 00:02:50.882
E^(A)_2 what A owns of
the payoffs of the future

00:02:50.882 --> 00:02:54.391
dividends,
[theta-bar^(A)_alpha

00:02:54.391 --> 00:02:57.977
times D^(alpha)_2 plus
theta-bar^(A)_beta

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.830
times]
D^(beta)_2.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.840
Since A owns half of the alpha
stock,

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.258
sorry, all of the alpha stock
and half of the beta stock,

00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:09.930
his endowment is 1,
his original thing,

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.449
plus what the stock is going to
produce,

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.878
and after all he's the owner.
 

00:03:12.878 --> 00:03:23.408
So he's going to get all of 1 a
half of 2 which is = 3.

00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:25.710
I took more space than I
thought.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.864
And so similarly
E-hat^(B)_2 is going

00:03:30.864 --> 00:03:34.449
to be 1 a half of 2 which = 2.
 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:44.483
So here endowments are this and
also let's just write it here,

00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:50.568
E-hat^(A)_2 = 3,
so this.

00:03:50.568 --> 00:03:53.598
So Fisher said we start with a
financial equilibrium,

00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:57.282
we can switch to the economic
equilibrium and solve this

00:03:57.282 --> 00:03:59.146
problem,
and having solved that one go

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:00.818
back and figure out how to solve
this one.

00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:02.990
And you remember what the
prices were.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.777
They turned out to be
q_1--I might as well

00:04:06.777 --> 00:04:09.750
write it up there what the
prices we had,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.788
we solved.
 

00:04:10.788 --> 00:04:13.169
We said first of all Fisher has
no theory for the

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.409
contemporaneous prices.
 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.160
It's all relative prices.
 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.350
I'm going to write that.
 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.220
Relative prices,
is all we can ever figure out.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.139
Someone might always come along
and change dollars to cents.

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.519
When I was a little boy in
France,

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:27.795
on vacation,
they suddenly announced that

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:29.899
the franc was going to be
divided--

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:33.690
everything that was a hundred
francs would now be one franc.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.228
They just redefined the
currency, so that might always

00:04:36.228 --> 00:04:36.660
happen.
 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.997
So you have to have some theory
of money and whether the

00:04:38.997 --> 00:04:41.759
government's going to do that to
figure out the nominal prices.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:47.110
So contemporaneous prices he
says are 1,1.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.187
All right, but having realized
that if there are many goods at

00:04:50.187 --> 00:04:52.709
time 1 he could figure out the
relative prices,

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.644
but with only 1 good at time
one who's to say whether we're

00:04:55.644 --> 00:04:57.670
measuring dollars or francs or
cents,

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.553
we'll just call it 1,
and the same thing's going to

00:04:59.553 --> 00:05:00.269
happen next year.
 

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:02.536
Who knows whether it's dollars
or cents or francs so we're

00:05:02.536 --> 00:05:03.610
going to call it 1 again.
 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.470
But after that he figured
everything out.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.110
This turned out to be a price
of a third,

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.153
this turned out to be a price
of 2 thirds and we figured out

00:05:14.153 --> 00:05:17.759
all the consumptions,
which I've forgotten, of course.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:24.392
But anyway they were--who knows
what they were,

00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:28.720
not that it's too important.
 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.740
All right, well I forgot what
they were.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.339
Anyway, he figured out all the
consumptions.

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:38.769
I think they were--actually I
sort of remember them.

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:39.440
Well, let's say I don't.
 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.860
Anyway, he figured out all the
consumptions.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.839
Does anyone remember what they
were?

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:58.113
All right, I will look them up,
4 thirds 2,2 thirds 2,

00:05:58.113 --> 00:06:08.750
so they were 4 thirds and 2,
and 2 thirds and 2.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.420
He figured out in equilibrium,
and how did he do it--because

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.689
he solved over here first.
 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:14.370
We would have solved--he didn't
do this exact problem,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.129
but he would have solved over
here and we would have found

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.288
with P_1 = 1,
P_2 = a third,

00:06:20.288 --> 00:06:24.009
and sure enough
X^(A)_1 = 4 thirds,

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.915
X^(A)_2 = 2,
and X^(B)_1 = 2

00:06:28.915 --> 00:06:32.639
thirds,
and X^(B)_2 = 2.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.240
So Fisher said start with the
financial economy,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.329
figure out what the reduced
general equilibrium is,

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:42.935
solve for this equilibrium,
and go back and figure out what

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.300
the financial equilibrium should
be.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.420
All right, so I want to now
examine what we've done.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.740
And we did that the end of last
class.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.680
You had to do it in a problem
set.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.579
And you notice that the only
difference between this and that

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.422
is,
the general equilibrium throws

00:06:55.422 --> 00:06:58.269
away a lot of irrelevant
information because Fisher said

00:06:58.269 --> 00:06:59.459
people are rational.
 

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:02.483
They look through the veil of
all the gibberish of who owns

00:07:02.483 --> 00:07:05.447
the company and stuff like that,
and they're just anticipating

00:07:05.447 --> 00:07:06.939
what the company is going to
produce.

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:09.845
They don't really care about
whether there's a man running

00:07:09.845 --> 00:07:12.029
the company,
or a woman running the company,

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:14.550
or whether she's got an MBA
from Harvard or from Yale.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.730
None of this is relevant,
what the business plan is.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.511
All they care about is what's
going to actually happen in the

00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:20.790
end.
 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.084
So if you think they're going
to anticipate that correctly you

00:07:23.084 --> 00:07:24.889
don't need to worry about all
the other stuff.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.081
So looking through the veil you
can always reduce the financial

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.720
equilibrium to a general
equilibrium.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.440
Now, I want to go back and
reexamine all that logic.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:44.040
So what's the first step in
what Fisher did?

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:50.949
And this is the idea of no
arbitrage.

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.980
So Fisher said people look
through the veil of things.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.437
They understand stuff and you
can count on their understanding

00:07:58.437 --> 00:08:00.990
to guide your understanding of
the economy.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.180
So if you know that
pi_alpha--

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:10.189
(this is a big
pi)--pi_alpha = a

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:12.497
third,
so Fisher says well,

00:08:12.497 --> 00:08:16.238
you don't have to solve for the
whole equilibrium to figure out

00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:17.990
what pi_beta is.
 

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.769
What would pi_beta be?
 

00:08:19.769 --> 00:08:23.934
Well, Fisher would have said
stock beta always pays off

00:08:23.934 --> 00:08:26.709
exactly what stock alpha pays
off.

00:08:26.709 --> 00:08:29.983
So if these people are rational
they're not going to allow for

00:08:29.983 --> 00:08:30.790
an arbitrage.
 

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:35.167
So arbitrage means if there are
two assets or two things that

00:08:35.167 --> 00:08:38.378
are identical,
they have to sell for the same

00:08:38.378 --> 00:08:40.639
price--that's no arbitrage.
 

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:43.759
If they sold for a different
price there'd be an arbitrage.

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:46.769
You'd sell the more expensive
one and buy the cheaper one,

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:49.629
and so you'd have accomplished
a perfect tradeoff,

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:51.750
but you'd have gotten the
difference of money.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.077
So since pi_alpha is
1 third, pi_beta has

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.519
to equal 2 thirds.
 

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:01.153
That's the first,
most important principle of

00:09:01.153 --> 00:09:05.679
finance that Fisher introduced;
the idea of no arbitrage and

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:08.058
making deductions for no
arbitrage,

00:09:08.058 --> 00:09:11.701
so most of finance is actually
being more and more clever about

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:13.168
how to do no arbitrage.
 

00:09:13.168 --> 00:09:16.888
Over half of this course is
going to be, let's look at

00:09:16.888 --> 00:09:21.096
situations where at first glance
there doesn't seem to be any

00:09:21.096 --> 00:09:22.080
arbitrage.
 

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.837
Then you realize if you're
clever enough you'll recognize

00:09:24.837 --> 00:09:27.399
an arbitrage and be able to
figure out all the prices

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:30.649
without having to know all the
utilities and everything else--

00:09:30.649 --> 00:09:34.721
so one of the main goals of
finance is to explain asset

00:09:34.721 --> 00:09:35.399
prices.
 

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:38.529
You can see how no arbitrage is
going to help do that,

00:09:38.529 --> 00:09:41.980
because if you knew what some
of the asset prices were you

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.279
could deduce what the rest might
be.

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:48.158
So that's the first thing
Fisher did, and he's used this

00:09:48.158 --> 00:09:51.049
fact in connecting these two
economies.

00:09:51.049 --> 00:09:53.110
So that's the first thing.
 

00:09:53.110 --> 00:10:01.080
Now, that principle can be used
over and over again.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:12.216
Another application of it,
let's suppose that we

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:26.668
introduced a nominal bond with
payoff 1 dollar in period 2.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:31.715
And suppose,
as before, that q_1 =

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:37.230
q_2 = 1,
as we've already supposed.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:50.162
So then by definition the price
of this bond is equal to 1 over

00:10:50.162 --> 00:10:59.340
1 i, where i is the nominal
interest rate.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.129
Why is that?
 

00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:02.399
Because you're going to get a
dollar next year.

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:05.532
If the price is less than a
dollar this year you're turning

00:11:05.532 --> 00:11:08.394
something less than a dollar
into something equal to a

00:11:08.394 --> 00:11:08.990
dollar.
 

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.971
You're multiplying today's
price by 1 i to get tomorrows

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:14.278
price,
so the rate of return is 1 i,

00:11:14.278 --> 00:11:17.980
taking whatever you put in
today and getting 1 i tomorrow.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.668
So what is 1 i?
 

00:11:21.668 --> 00:11:29.590
So by no arbitrage we can
figure out what 1 i must be.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:40.037
So 1 dollar today can go into 3
units of stock alpha,

00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:50.684
which goes into 3 units of
X_2 as dividends,

00:11:50.684 --> 00:11:56.110
which equals 3 dollars.
 

00:11:56.110 --> 00:12:00.788
So you take 1 dollar today by
buying stock alpha you can get 3

00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:04.009
units of it since its price is a
third,

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:10.724
and since stock alpha pays one
unit of output next period you

00:12:10.724 --> 00:12:17.548
know that 1 dollar today gives
you 3 units of stock alpha,

00:12:17.548 --> 00:12:21.102
which gives you 3 units of good
2 as the output and at price 1

00:12:21.102 --> 00:12:24.250
dollar tomorrow you've
anticipated that's 3 dollars.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.024
So by buying stock alpha you
can put in a dollar and get out

00:12:27.024 --> 00:12:27.590
3 dollars.
 

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:34.996
So it means that 1 i = 3,
which means the interest rate

00:12:34.996 --> 00:12:37.330
is 200 percent.
 

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.000
So that's a second thing you
can deduce from that.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.273
So notice that by looking at
part of the equilibrium here we

00:12:45.273 --> 00:12:48.269
can figure out a lot of the rest
of the equilibrium.

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:52.048
So what's another application?
 

00:12:52.048 --> 00:13:03.942
Well, Fisher said define the
real interest rate as number of

00:13:03.942 --> 00:13:13.620
goods today goes into number of
good tomorrow.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:19.950
So this will be,
1 r equals that.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.120
The number of goods today and
how many good tomorrow do you

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:23.450
get?
 

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:24.850
So how can you do that?
 

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:34.883
Well, 1 good today,
1 unit of X_1 is 1

00:13:34.883 --> 00:13:39.580
dollar today,
right?

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.326
If you had one apple today you
could sell it for q_1

00:13:43.326 --> 00:13:45.615
times 1 apple,
which is q_1 times 1,

00:13:45.615 --> 00:13:48.758
which is 1 times 1,
which is 1 dollar today,

00:13:48.758 --> 00:13:55.301
which you can get 3 units,
3 shares, 3 units of stock

00:13:55.301 --> 00:14:02.580
alpha, which gives you 3 units
of X_2.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:07.354
So 1 unit of X_1
today turns into 3 units of

00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:11.317
X_2,
so therefore 1 r = 3 implies r

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:12.940
= 200 percent.
 

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.480
So that's the real rate of
interest.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.025
So one of the tricks in going
from here to here was to say

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:20.750
that Fisher realized that people
are going to look through all

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:23.163
the gibberish of money and
they're going to think about

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:25.842
what apples are they giving up
today and what apples are they

00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:26.960
getting tomorrow.
 

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:32.164
They're not going to be
confused by all the holding of

00:14:32.164 --> 00:14:34.129
assets in between.
 

00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:37.629
All right, so let's just make
it a little bit more

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:38.629
complicated.
 

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:47.823
Suppose we started with
q_1 = 1,

00:14:47.823 --> 00:14:52.308
q_2 = 2.
 

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:56.961
Now, I told you that
equilibrium--Fisher says there's

00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:59.200
always a normalization.
 

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.009
Walras originally had the
normalization in one period.

00:15:02.009 --> 00:15:04.230
There's a one period model in
general equilibrium.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.678
In multi-period models there's
a normalization every period.

00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:10.345
Every period there's a choice
of whether you're dealing with

00:15:10.345 --> 00:15:11.745
dollars, or francs,
or centimes,

00:15:11.745 --> 00:15:13.235
or how many,
and so there's a free

00:15:13.235 --> 00:15:14.139
normalization.
 

00:15:14.139 --> 00:15:17.230
So let's take q_1 = 1
and q_2 = 2.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.778
Well, what does that mean?
 

00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:24.091
That means that inflation 1
(let's call it growth of money)

00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:29.220
g--i, I've already used for the
nominal interest rate.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:33.320
So, 1 g is going to be 2 over 1
or just 2.

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:44.480
So inflation = 100 percent.
 

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.190
So what's pi_alpha
going to be?

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:51.019
I've done my work.
 

00:15:51.019 --> 00:15:53.077
Now the rest I'm going to just
ask you for the rest of the

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:53.440
numbers.
 

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.350
What's pi_alpha?
 

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.847
So if I re-solved equilibrium
taking q_1 = 1 and

00:16:00.847 --> 00:16:04.469
q_2 = 2 all that's
kind of money stuff so it's not

00:16:04.469 --> 00:16:07.168
going to change what happens
over there.

00:16:07.168 --> 00:16:09.057
You're going to get the same
equilibrium over there and

00:16:09.057 --> 00:16:10.418
you're going to go back to over
here.

00:16:10.418 --> 00:16:21.049
So what's pi_alpha
going to be?

00:16:21.049 --> 00:16:24.370
Ah-ha!
 

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.178
Suppose we knew we were in the
same real economy.

00:16:27.178 --> 00:16:30.044
There's nothing changed about
utilities, endowments of goods,

00:16:30.044 --> 00:16:31.428
productivity of the stocks.
 

00:16:31.428 --> 00:16:34.440
All we know is that inflation's
going to be higher now.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.460
So what do you think would
happen in the new equilibrium?

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:47.259
What's going to happen to the
price of stocks today?

00:16:47.259 --> 00:16:48.548
Yes?
 

00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:51.259
Student: Is it just 2
dollars?

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:53.379
Prof: Price of stock
alpha.

00:16:53.379 --> 00:16:54.320
What was it before?
 

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.798
Student:
&gt;

00:16:56.798 --> 00:16:58.139
Prof: So what was it
before?

00:16:58.139 --> 00:16:59.288
Student: 1 third.
 

00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:06.368
Prof: Yeah,
1 third, so it's still 1 third.

00:17:06.368 --> 00:17:10.053
This is a big mystery in
finance, a big question in

00:17:10.053 --> 00:17:10.789
finance.
 

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:13.470
So you see why it's puzzling.
 

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:15.900
You didn't get the answer right
off, although she did.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.608
So you just have to think about
it a second.

00:17:17.608 --> 00:17:21.165
If you really thought that
people when they were buying and

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:25.028
selling only bought a stock
because they said to themselves,

00:17:25.028 --> 00:17:27.568
"How many apples am I
going to get out of this stock?

00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:30.109
I don't care about dollars and
centimes and francs.

00:17:30.109 --> 00:17:30.970
I'm not going to eat that.
 

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.865
I'm going to eat the apples,
and maybe I get the apples and

00:17:33.865 --> 00:17:36.961
sell them and eat pears instead,
but I care about the goods I'm

00:17:36.961 --> 00:17:37.808
going to get.
 

00:17:37.808 --> 00:17:39.328
So I looked through all the
veil."

00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:43.632
I should recognize that the
stock, although it's now going

00:17:43.632 --> 00:17:47.028
to pay twice as many dollars as
it did before,

00:17:47.028 --> 00:17:49.670
so it's going to pay 2 dollars.
 

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.289
That's how someone guessed 2.
 

00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:52.400
Someone said 2.
 

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.318
So how did he get 2?
 

00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:55.190
I didn't even realize how he
came up with the number 2.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:56.980
He came up with the number 2
because he said,

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.710
well the stock is paying 1
apple tomorrow,

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.797
the price of apples is now 2,
so it's paying 2 dollars

00:18:03.797 --> 00:18:07.500
tomorrow so maybe its price
today should be 2.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.368
But no, that isn't how much the
stock is worth.

00:18:09.368 --> 00:18:14.604
The stock is worth solving for
this general equilibrium supply

00:18:14.604 --> 00:18:15.720
and demand.
 

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.528
We already calculated before
that the stock was a third,

00:18:18.528 --> 00:18:23.105
so the price of the stock is
going to stay a third because

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:26.720
the apples it pays tomorrow
hasn't changed.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.470
It's still the same one apple.
 

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.059
Now, how did we know the stock
was priced at a third before?

00:18:32.059 --> 00:18:34.910
What was the stock in general?
 

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.759
What's the price of the stock?
 

00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:39.787
The price of stock,
remember, is how did we get it

00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:41.578
by going from here to here?
 

00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:46.442
We said it's going to equal the
price of the stock divided by

00:18:46.442 --> 00:18:47.740
P_1.
 

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:51.328
Now, the stock is only paying a
certain number of goods.

00:18:51.328 --> 00:19:10.501
The price of the stock today is
going to equal the present value

00:19:10.501 --> 00:19:20.849
1 over (1 r) times its dividend.
 

00:19:20.849 --> 00:19:23.480
I'll write it this way.
 

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.000
The price of the stock is
P_2 times this.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.170
Let's just write this.
 

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.880
What would Fisher say?
 

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.823
How did we get the price of the
stock from going from here to

00:19:34.823 --> 00:19:35.400
here?
 

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:47.404
We got the price of the stock
by saying the stock pays off one

00:19:47.404 --> 00:19:53.373
good tomorrow,
but one good tomorrow is only

00:19:53.373 --> 00:20:00.204
worth a third of one good today,
so therefore the value of the

00:20:00.204 --> 00:20:06.680
stock is only equal to a third
times 1 = 1 third.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:30.848
So assuming P_1 = 1
that's what Fisher would say.

00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:37.957
Assuming P_1 is 1 you
figure out how many units of

00:20:37.957 --> 00:20:41.210
today's good is it worth.
 

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.960
Now, if P_1 isn't 1
then what do you do?

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.032
Suppose P_1 were 5
and P_2 were--or

00:20:47.032 --> 00:20:49.878
P_1 is 6,
let's say, and P_2 is

00:20:49.878 --> 00:20:51.529
2 then what would you do?
 

00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:59.058
You'd have to say P_1
times pi_alpha =

00:20:59.058 --> 00:21:02.230
D^(alpha)_2.
 

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:08.073
So if you multiplied all the
prices by--am I putting the

00:21:08.073 --> 00:21:12.960
P_1 down at the bottom
or the top?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:17.519
If you multiply out all the
prices by 3, just leave it like

00:21:17.519 --> 00:21:18.068
this.
 

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:19.663
We'll say if pi_alpha
= P_2 times

00:21:19.663 --> 00:21:20.400
D^(alpha)_2.
 

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.858
If you measure it in terms of
goods, that's how you do it.

00:21:25.858 --> 00:21:31.891
So if you take this,
this is also equal to 1 over

00:21:31.891 --> 00:21:38.803
P_1 divided by
P_2 (if P_1

00:21:38.803 --> 00:21:42.627
is 1,
assuming P_1 is 1)

00:21:42.627 --> 00:21:48.517
times D^(alpha)_2,
which is 1 over (1 r) times

00:21:48.517 --> 00:21:51.190
D^(alpha)_2.
 

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:55.568
So Fisher said--so here's his
famous equation.

00:21:55.568 --> 00:21:58.608
Fisher said the way to figure
out the value of a stock,

00:21:58.608 --> 00:22:00.318
if you solve that problem over
here,

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:04.630
is to look at its dividends and
discount them by the real rate

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.171
of interest--
1 unit of output tomorrow,

00:22:07.171 --> 00:22:10.473
since the value of an apple
tomorrow is only a third of the

00:22:10.473 --> 00:22:12.068
value of an output today.
 

00:22:12.068 --> 00:22:20.117
Remember the interest rate 1 r,
the real interest rate,

00:22:20.117 --> 00:22:26.230
is equal to the ratio of the
two goods.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.445
So P_1 over
P_2 is just 1 r,

00:22:29.445 --> 00:22:32.318
1 r is P_1 over
P_2.

00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:36.045
I'm making some things simple
seem more complicated,

00:22:36.045 --> 00:22:36.630
sorry.
 

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.880
So let's just say it again.
 

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.700
When we solved that equilibrium
over there we figured out that

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.769
P_2 is only a third of
P_1.

00:22:44.769 --> 00:22:47.720
When people think today how
much would I give up of apples

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.773
today to get an apple next year
they don't think apples next

00:22:50.773 --> 00:22:53.568
year are worth nearly as much as
apples this year.

00:22:53.568 --> 00:22:57.268
So they'd only give up a third
of an apple this year to get an

00:22:57.268 --> 00:22:58.358
apple next year.
 

00:22:58.358 --> 00:23:01.326
P_2 is the amount you
give up today to get an apple

00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:02.759
next year, so it's a third.
 

00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:05.150
Another way of saying that,
if P_1 is 1,

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.435
is that the real interest rate,
the tradeoff between apples

00:23:08.435 --> 00:23:11.383
tomorrow and apples today which
is P_1 over

00:23:11.383 --> 00:23:14.750
P_2,
because 1 apple today can give

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.973
you three apples tomorrow,
so P_1 over

00:23:17.973 --> 00:23:21.910
P_2 is 3,
so 1 r is three.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.191
So the apple tomorrow is worth
P_2 times the

00:23:26.191 --> 00:23:27.078
dividend.
 

00:23:27.078 --> 00:23:30.838
That's just 1 over (1 r) times
the dividend.

00:23:30.838 --> 00:23:36.018
So the value of a stock is the
real dividends it's paying in

00:23:36.018 --> 00:23:40.670
the future discounted by the
real rate of interest.

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:42.848
You're turning tomorrow's next
year's goods,

00:23:42.848 --> 00:23:46.019
finding the equivalent in terms
of this year's goods,

00:23:46.019 --> 00:23:48.762
and the ratio of those two
prices is the real rate of

00:23:48.762 --> 00:23:51.190
interest and so that's how you
would get it.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:56.428
So another way of saying the
same thing is you could turn

00:23:56.428 --> 00:23:59.890
cash next year into cash this
year.

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:06.817
So assuming q_1 is 1,
another way of saying that is 1

00:24:06.817 --> 00:24:11.397
over 1 i times
D^(alpha)_2 times

00:24:11.397 --> 00:24:13.410
q_2.
 

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:18.663
So you take the nominal rate of
interest times the money that's

00:24:18.663 --> 00:24:21.654
being produced,
because the nominal rate of

00:24:21.654 --> 00:24:24.967
interest says how do you trade
off a dollar today for a dollar

00:24:24.967 --> 00:24:25.890
in the future?
 

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.637
So a dollar in the future isn't
worth, usually,

00:24:29.637 --> 00:24:34.118
as much as a dollar today so
you have to discount it.

00:24:34.118 --> 00:24:37.011
So a certain number of dollars
in the future are worth less

00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:37.808
dollars today.
 

00:24:37.808 --> 00:24:40.692
So you take the payoff of
dollars in the future discounted

00:24:40.692 --> 00:24:43.779
by the nominal rate of interest
and you get today's price,

00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:48.736
or you take the real dividends
in the future discounted by the

00:24:48.736 --> 00:24:52.798
real rate of interest and you
get today's price.

00:24:52.798 --> 00:24:56.607
So both those things are an
application of the principle of

00:24:56.607 --> 00:24:59.298
no arbitrage,
looking through the veil.

00:24:59.298 --> 00:25:01.660
So what would the nominal
interest rate be in this case?

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.858
In this case you see,
how did I know that P^(alpha)

00:25:03.858 --> 00:25:04.740
was still a third?
 

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.009
Because the real interest rate
hasn't changed,

00:25:07.009 --> 00:25:08.269
it's still 200 percent.
 

00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:12.218
So D^(alpha)_2 is 1
and I'm still multiplying by 1

00:25:12.218 --> 00:25:16.298
third, so I'm still getting a
third for the price of alpha.

00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:19.140
So that's how she knew that the
answer should stay a third

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.130
because she knew nothing real
had changed in the economy,

00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:23.980
therefore the real interest
rate couldn't have changed,

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.990
therefore the price of the
stock still had to be the same.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.721
So how could we have used this
[clarification:

00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:30.759
another formula]
formula?

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:32.640
We have to know what the
nominal interest rate is.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.980
So what is the nominal interest
rate?

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:39.865
If you put in a dollar today
how many dollars can you get out

00:25:39.865 --> 00:25:43.105
in the future in this new
economy where there's 100

00:25:43.105 --> 00:25:44.529
percent inflation?
 

00:25:44.529 --> 00:25:46.430
Yes?
 

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.769
Student: 500 percent
inflation.

00:25:48.769 --> 00:25:50.630
Prof: So that's right,
now how did he do that?

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:52.000
Because let's just do it.
 

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.318
You take 1 dollar today at
price q_1 = 1.

00:25:56.318 --> 00:26:00.921
You can buy 3 units of alpha
still, because its price is

00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:04.685
still a third,
and that tells you that you get

00:26:04.685 --> 00:26:08.868
3 units of X_2,
that's the dividend.

00:26:08.868 --> 00:26:12.598
Of 3 units of alpha each share
of alpha pays 1,

00:26:12.598 --> 00:26:16.048
right, 1 apple,
so now you get 3 apples,

00:26:16.048 --> 00:26:20.559
but that's equal to 3 times 2
because the price is 2,

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:25.160
= 6 dollars tomorrow.
 

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.890
So you've turned 1 dollar into
6 dollars.

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:35.046
So 1 i = 6 over 1 implies i =
500 percent, just exactly what

00:26:35.046 --> 00:26:36.259
he said.
 

00:26:36.259 --> 00:26:42.906
So to say that just more simply
the real rate of interest 1 r,

00:26:42.906 --> 00:26:48.355
this is the most famous
equation Fisher ever wrote,

00:26:48.355 --> 00:26:51.190
is 1 i divided by 1 g.
 

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:53.848
So this is called the Fisher
Equation.

00:26:53.848 --> 00:26:58.157
His two famous equations are
this, this is called the Fisher

00:26:58.157 --> 00:27:00.858
Equation and this which is
called--

00:27:00.858 --> 00:27:09.773
these two things which are the
same are called the Fundamental

00:27:09.773 --> 00:27:13.720
Theorem of Asset Pricing.
 

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.568
So why is this theorem true?
 

00:27:15.568 --> 00:27:18.608
The real rate of interest
trades off apples today for

00:27:18.608 --> 00:27:20.644
apples tomorrow,
the real rate of interest,

00:27:20.644 --> 00:27:21.890
apples today for apples
tomorrow,

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.359
so we had 1 apple giving you 3
apples.

00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:26.068
That's why r was 200 percent.
 

00:27:26.068 --> 00:27:30.880
Well, if inflation is 100
percent, so this is 2,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.769
1 apple today gives you 3
apples in the future,

00:27:34.769 --> 00:27:37.848
but that means 1 apple today
gives you 1 dollar,

00:27:37.848 --> 00:27:41.002
is one apple today gives you 3
apples or 6 dollars in the

00:27:41.002 --> 00:27:41.509
future.
 

00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:45.497
So 3 times 2,
so if this is equal to 3 and

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:51.330
inflation's 100 percent so this
is equal to 2 then what's the

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.859
fair rate of interest?
 

00:27:53.859 --> 00:27:55.078
What will the banks give you?
 

00:27:55.078 --> 00:27:57.936
Well, any banker can take a
dollar, buy a stock,

00:27:57.936 --> 00:28:01.279
turn it into 3 units of
dividends and then sell it for 2

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:03.528
dollars apiece and get 6
dollars.

00:28:03.528 --> 00:28:06.278
And so a banker can take a
dollar and turn it to 6,

00:28:06.278 --> 00:28:09.134
so competition will force the
bankers to give you 6 dollars

00:28:09.134 --> 00:28:11.548
for every 1 dollar you give it,
next period.

00:28:11.548 --> 00:28:17.365
So the interest rate has to be
1 i = 3 times 2,

00:28:17.365 --> 00:28:18.250
or 6.
 

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:22.344
So the real rate of interest is
the nominal rate of interest

00:28:22.344 --> 00:28:23.940
divided by inflation.
 

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:29.798
So that's one subtle,
but once you realize it,

00:28:29.798 --> 00:28:33.897
obvious implication of thinking
people are rational and make

00:28:33.897 --> 00:28:37.509
sort of simple calculations
looking at the future.

00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:40.480
And a consequence of that is
the price of assets,

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.861
or you look at the cash that
comes out in the future

00:28:42.861 --> 00:28:44.868
discounted by the nominal
interest rate,

00:28:44.868 --> 00:28:47.625
or you look at the real goods
that come out in the future and

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:49.509
discount it by the real interest
rate,

00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:53.338
and it's all the same thing.
 

00:28:53.338 --> 00:28:57.412
So does anybody know what the
inflation is today,

00:28:57.412 --> 00:29:01.400
or what the nominal interest
rates are today?

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.067
So i is the nominal interest
rate, the amount of interest you

00:29:05.067 --> 00:29:08.980
put in the bank and what they'll
pay you at the end of a year.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.962
So we're going to--next class
we're going to find out the

00:29:11.962 --> 00:29:14.146
exact numbers,
but what do you think it is

00:29:14.146 --> 00:29:14.680
about?
 

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:19.609
Does anyone have any idea?
 

00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:20.579
Take a wild guess.
 

00:29:20.579 --> 00:29:22.630
Is it 10 percent, 5 percent?
 

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:24.210
Yep?
 

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:26.034
Student: I think the
inflation is usually around 3

00:29:26.034 --> 00:29:26.358
percent.
 

00:29:26.358 --> 00:29:28.788
Prof: Usually,
and do you think it's higher or

00:29:28.788 --> 00:29:30.190
lower than usual now-a-days?
 

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.049
Student: It's probably
lower.

00:29:31.049 --> 00:29:32.288
Prof: That's good.
 

00:29:32.288 --> 00:29:34.769
So let's say it's around 2
percent.

00:29:34.769 --> 00:29:38.525
So that means this is 1.02 and
what do you think the nominal

00:29:38.525 --> 00:29:39.990
interest rate is now?
 

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.049
Student: 1 percent.
 

00:29:42.049 --> 00:29:42.578
Prof: Who said that?
 

00:29:42.578 --> 00:29:46.420
That's a good--1 percent,
that's about right.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.470
So what is the real rate of
interest now?

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.150
Student:
&gt;

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:51.710
Prof: What?
 

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.710
Student:
&gt;

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:56.519
Prof: Well,
1 r is less than 1.

00:29:56.519 --> 00:30:02.358
So 1 r is around .99.
 

00:30:02.358 --> 00:30:04.914
So the real rate of interest is
actually like negative 1

00:30:04.914 --> 00:30:05.380
percent.
 

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.298
How did that happen?
 

00:30:06.298 --> 00:30:09.915
Do you think it's standard to
have the real interest rate be

00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:10.529
under 0?
 

00:30:10.529 --> 00:30:13.140
So why is it under 0?
 

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.349
What's going on now that would
make that happen?

00:30:15.349 --> 00:30:16.450
Yep?
 

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.071
Student: The Federal
Reserve wants to stimulate

00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:18.470
investment.
 

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.900
Prof: Ah ha!
 

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.818
The Federal Reserve has cut the
interest rate,

00:30:21.818 --> 00:30:25.980
the nominal interest rate that
it lends at to close to 0,

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.231
let's say to 1 percent on the 1
year bond to 0 on the 3 month

00:30:30.231 --> 00:30:30.798
thing.
 

00:30:30.798 --> 00:30:33.385
So the reason they're saying
they're doing that is to

00:30:33.385 --> 00:30:34.529
stimulate investment.
 

00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:36.923
That's what they teach you in
macro, Keynesian,

00:30:36.923 --> 00:30:38.118
stimulate investment.
 

00:30:38.118 --> 00:30:40.330
We're going to find out that
that's not the reason they're

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.029
doing it at all.
 

00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:43.932
The reason the Federal Reserve
is cutting the interest rate to

00:30:43.932 --> 00:30:46.357
almost zero is to just give
money away to the banks,

00:30:46.357 --> 00:30:47.308
and why it that?
 

00:30:47.308 --> 00:30:49.646
Well, when you put your money
and deposit it in the bank

00:30:49.646 --> 00:30:51.220
you're getting almost no
interest,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.378
so the banks,
the big banks have got all

00:30:53.378 --> 00:30:56.368
these deposits and people don't
change what they do.

00:30:56.368 --> 00:30:58.970
They just leave their money in
the banks getting no interest.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.535
So the banks have the money for
free and they can make money

00:31:02.535 --> 00:31:03.140
with it.
 

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.960
So normally they'd have to pay
3 percent interest or something

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.808
and that would be expensive for
them,

00:31:07.808 --> 00:31:10.569
and that expense is a big part
of their expenses,

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:12.308
they don't have it anymore.
 

00:31:12.308 --> 00:31:14.166
So we're going to come back to
that what's really going on

00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.338
today, but that's what's going
on.

00:31:15.338 --> 00:31:18.846
But anyway, the point is the
nominal interest rate is somehow

00:31:18.846 --> 00:31:20.250
controlled by the Fed.
 

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.730
That's why we don't have a
theory of it.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:23.509
We're not going to do macro in
this course.

00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:26.618
So Fisher doesn't have a theory
of the nominal interest rate,

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:28.788
of inflation,
but he does tell you,

00:31:28.788 --> 00:31:32.259
given inflation and the nominal
interest rate,

00:31:32.259 --> 00:31:34.440
that's determining a real
interest rate,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.769
and people should look through
that.

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:39.057
So now they should say,
this is sort of the Keynesian

00:31:39.057 --> 00:31:41.155
part,
they should realize that

00:31:41.155 --> 00:31:45.595
actually an apple today if you
just sort of put it in the bank

00:31:45.595 --> 00:31:49.887
you get less than an apple in
the future so you should spend

00:31:49.887 --> 00:31:52.288
it and do something with it.
 

00:31:52.288 --> 00:31:54.702
That's the Keynesian idea,
so people--why fritter away

00:31:54.702 --> 00:31:56.660
part of your apple,
do something with it.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.845
That's why it's supposed to
stimulate demand and activity

00:31:59.845 --> 00:32:00.298
today.
 

00:32:00.298 --> 00:32:03.239
So the point is,
that's how you calculate the

00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:06.778
real rate of interest and
shockingly it's negative and

00:32:06.778 --> 00:32:10.009
it's hardly ever negative,
but it can be negative.

00:32:10.009 --> 00:32:17.288
Are there any questions about
this no arbitrage business?

00:32:17.288 --> 00:32:45.068
All right, so let's do one more
trick here, a Fisher thing.

00:32:45.068 --> 00:32:52.252
So let's go back to the
equilibrium with q_1 =

00:32:52.252 --> 00:32:55.650
1 and q_2 = 1.
 

00:32:55.650 --> 00:33:05.734
Suppose China offered to lend
money, lend us dollars at a 0

00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:09.039
percent interest?
 

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:14.730
Would that be a great deal?
 

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:24.759
Would people rush to do that?
 

00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:31.240
This is the equilibrium we
solved over here already.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.230
So is that a great deal?
 

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:33.490
Would that upset the
equilibrium?

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.430
Would anyone bother to take the
Chinese deal if they lent at 0

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.839
percent interest,
they were offering to do that?

00:33:38.839 --> 00:33:48.539
 
 

00:33:48.539 --> 00:33:49.880
What?
 

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.650
Student: No.
 

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.789
Professor John Geanakoplos:
They wouldn't take it?

00:33:54.789 --> 00:33:56.140
We're back here.
 

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.115
What's the nominal interest
rate in this economy?.

00:33:59.115 --> 00:34:01.000
Student: 200 percent.
 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.808
Professor John Geanakoplos:
200 percent interest,

00:34:02.808 --> 00:34:05.390
so if you want to borrow in
this economy from another

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:08.219
American you have to give the
guy 200 percent interest.

00:34:08.219 --> 00:34:10.447
Here the Chinese are offering
to lend you at 0 percent

00:34:10.447 --> 00:34:10.909
interest.
 

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:14.480
So, yes, everyone would rush to
take the thing and that would

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.989
have a big effect on what the
equilibrium was if the Chinese

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:21.679
were willing to lend money at
such a low rate of interest.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:23.900
Let's try another question.
 

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:33.554
Suppose you invented a
technology, new technology,

00:34:33.554 --> 00:34:41.829
new technology turns 1 unit,
1 apple today,

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:47.150
into 2 apples tomorrow.
 

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:50.159
Is this something people would
rush to do or not?

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.262
Suppose some inventor figured
out how to do that,

00:34:53.262 --> 00:34:54.880
would he rush to do it?
 

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.269
Could it be used to help the
economy?

00:34:57.269 --> 00:34:58.789
So let's put it this way.
 

00:34:58.789 --> 00:35:12.313
Could this new technology be
used to make a Pareto

00:35:12.313 --> 00:35:22.250
improvement, everybody better
off?

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.429
Yep?
 

00:35:23.429 --> 00:35:27.710
Student: That's no,
because an apple tomorrow is

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.960
worth less than half of an apple
today.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.684
It's worth a third of an apple
today, so no one would want to

00:35:36.684 --> 00:35:37.639
do that.
 

00:35:37.639 --> 00:35:40.228
Professor John Geanakoplos:
So that's exactly the right

00:35:40.228 --> 00:35:40.659
answer.
 

00:35:40.659 --> 00:35:41.809
Actually you're answering two
questions.

00:35:41.809 --> 00:35:43.010
I asked two questions.
 

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:46.514
One is could it be used to help
the economy, make everybody

00:35:46.514 --> 00:35:47.300
better off?
 

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.740
If a social planner was in
charge of things and the Chinese

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.268
invented this new technology,
or some American in Alaska

00:35:54.268 --> 00:35:57.838
invented this new technology
should the government use the

00:35:57.838 --> 00:36:01.534
technology and could it use the
technology to make everybody

00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:04.309
better off,
and the answer to that is no.

00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:07.083
And then the answer to a second
question is--suppose the guy in

00:36:07.083 --> 00:36:08.469
Alaska discovered it himself.
 

00:36:08.469 --> 00:36:11.759
He couldn't care less about the
Pareto improvement and helping

00:36:11.759 --> 00:36:14.510
other guys or the American
planners or anything,

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.670
he just wanted to make a profit
for himself.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.820
Would he make a profit?
 

00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:22.789
The answer is no,
because the real prices,

00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:26.235
Fisher would say,
are 1 and a third and no matter

00:36:26.235 --> 00:36:29.610
how you look at it the interest
rate is 200--

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:32.460
he's losing money,
because he's giving something

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.797
up that's worth 1 and he's
getting something that's only

00:36:35.797 --> 00:36:36.949
worth 2 thirds.
 

00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:38.429
So he'd be losing money to do
it.

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:39.480
He'd lose money.
 

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.510
So we could prove that even.
 

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:48.260
So the answer is no.
 

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:51.699
That's the first question,
and nobody would do it anyway.

00:36:51.699 --> 00:37:04.072
And fortunately nobody would
choose to do it--choose to use

00:37:04.072 --> 00:37:10.260
it--because it loses money.
 

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.000
So those are two separate
questions.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.289
Could it be used and would any
individual choose to do it?

00:37:16.289 --> 00:37:18.507
Would it be good for the
society and would any individual

00:37:18.507 --> 00:37:19.219
choose to do it?
 

00:37:19.219 --> 00:37:21.059
The answers happen to agree
here.

00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:23.768
So why can't it be used as a
Pareto improvement?

00:37:23.768 --> 00:37:27.849
What's the proof of this that
it can't be?

00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:28.809
The answer's no.
 

00:37:28.809 --> 00:37:31.750
What's the proof?
 

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.760
Well, the proof is that if it
did,

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:43.414
if in the end it led to an
allocation

00:37:43.414 --> 00:37:49.690
X-hat^(A)_1,
let's call it X-tilde

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.791
^(A)_1,
X-tilde^(A)_2,

00:37:52.791 --> 00:38:00.934
and Xtilde^(B)_1,
Xtilde^(B)_2 that

00:38:00.934 --> 00:38:06.179
made everyone better off.
 

00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:08.789
Then, well, we give their old
proof.

00:38:08.789 --> 00:38:09.559
Then what?
 

00:38:09.559 --> 00:38:12.940
It means that P_1
Xtilde^(A)_1

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:16.043
P_2
Xtilde^(A)_2 is bigger

00:38:16.043 --> 00:38:17.010
than what?
 

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:20.039
P_1^(
)E-hat^(A)_1--

00:38:20.039 --> 00:38:25.202
(all right, that's what you
have in the Fisher economy)

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:30.079
P_2 E-hat^(A)2 and
similarly P_1

00:38:30.079 --> 00:38:33.521
X-tilde^(B)_1
P_2

00:38:33.521 --> 00:38:38.398
X-tilde^(B)_2 is
bigger than P_1

00:38:38.398 --> 00:38:41.650
E-hat^(B)_1
P_2

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:44.710
E-hat^(B)_2.
 

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:47.320
So why is that?
 

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:50.599
Because in this Fisher economy,
the general equilibrium--

00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:53.688
if this allocation really made
A better off than what he's

00:38:53.688 --> 00:38:55.788
gotten,
than 4 third and 2,

00:38:55.788 --> 00:38:57.840
he would have chosen it.
 

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.418
And B, she would have chosen
her thing if it was better than

00:39:01.418 --> 00:39:02.449
2 thirds and 2.
 

00:39:02.449 --> 00:39:04.838
So clearly they must have been
too expensive for those two to

00:39:04.838 --> 00:39:06.947
choose because they were
rationally choosing the right

00:39:06.947 --> 00:39:08.500
thing given what they could
afford.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.980
So then you just add the stuff
up.

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:22.117
You add and you find that total
consumption value is bigger than

00:39:22.117 --> 00:39:25.980
total endowment value.
 

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:29.273
That's in the Fisher economy,
but we've changed the Fisher

00:39:29.273 --> 00:39:32.855
economy because now we've added
this technology which took away

00:39:32.855 --> 00:39:36.380
some of the first good and made
it into the second good,

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.590
but that technology just lost
money,

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:50.519
which is bigger than total
value in new technology economy,

00:39:50.519 --> 00:39:50.920
right?
 

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.690
And so that's a contradiction
because the consumption of this,

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.286
however the new technology got
used in the end the total

00:39:58.286 --> 00:40:01.213
consumption of the people had to
be the total of what there was

00:40:01.213 --> 00:40:03.150
and what was produced in the
economy.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.596
The value after the new
technology is introduced in that

00:40:06.596 --> 00:40:10.670
new economy has only gone down
compared to the Fisher economy,

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:14.045
and the Fisher economy value of
endowments must have been less

00:40:14.045 --> 00:40:16.150
than this brilliant new
allocation,

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:19.300
and that's a contradiction
because this new allocation has

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.396
to add up to the stuff that's
there in the new technology

00:40:22.396 --> 00:40:23.059
economy.
 

00:40:23.059 --> 00:40:26.853
So that's how we know that no
new technology could possibly

00:40:26.853 --> 00:40:31.507
make everybody better off,
and we know trivially it makes

00:40:31.507 --> 00:40:36.469
everyone better off if and only
if it makes a profit.

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:39.945
So if and only if it makes a
profit can it be used to make

00:40:39.945 --> 00:40:42.427
everybody better off,
and amazingly,

00:40:42.427 --> 00:40:45.679
in a free market economy,
people are going to use it if

00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:47.059
and only if it makes a profit.
 

00:40:47.059 --> 00:40:49.539
So they're going to use it if
and only if it's a good thing

00:40:49.539 --> 00:40:50.309
for the economy.
 

00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:53.246
So that's the basic
laissez-faire argument--that

00:40:53.246 --> 00:40:55.809
there are new discoveries all
the time.

00:40:55.809 --> 00:40:58.530
Every other day somebody's
thinking of something new.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.000
Are we going to use it?
 

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.619
Should we use it?
 

00:41:00.619 --> 00:41:03.280
Is it something we need to read
about in the papers and use?

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:06.130
Well, there are a whole bunch
of people,

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.510
the discoverers themselves
they're going to talk to their

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:10.373
business friends,
and they're going to say,

00:41:10.373 --> 00:41:12.601
"Do you want to lend me
the money to get this thing

00:41:12.601 --> 00:41:14.831
going," and all of them are
going to do this profit

00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:15.518
calculation.
 

00:41:15.518 --> 00:41:18.335
If they decide it loses money
they're not going to do it,

00:41:18.335 --> 00:41:21.000
and thank god for that because
it couldn't have helped

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.659
everybody if they did use it.
 

00:41:22.659 --> 00:41:25.690
So that's the main lesson of
laissez-faire.

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:30.440
So let me just put this in
perspective a little bit.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:35.715
In the old Russian economy of
the 1930s and '40s there was no

00:41:35.715 --> 00:41:39.074
profit system,
so the central planner had to

00:41:39.074 --> 00:41:41.527
figure out,
should a new invention be used

00:41:41.527 --> 00:41:41.960
or not.
 

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.333
So every time there's a new
invention a committee had to get

00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:46.748
together, of central planners
and decide whether to use it or

00:41:46.748 --> 00:41:47.070
not.
 

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:50.480
And there's a famous guy named
Kantorovich who was in charge of

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.360
a lot of that.
 

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:54.420
He won the Nobel Prize in
economics.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.826
He shared it with a Yale
economist named Koopmans and so

00:41:57.826 --> 00:42:00.489
Kantorovich told this very
amusing story.

00:42:00.489 --> 00:42:02.929
He said that there were two
central planning bureaus.

00:42:02.929 --> 00:42:05.427
One was in charge of
allocations and one was in

00:42:05.427 --> 00:42:06.460
charge of prices.
 

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.518
One had to set the prices.
 

00:42:07.518 --> 00:42:09.070
The other had to set the
allocations.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:12.193
And of course the whole message
here is that you have to combine

00:42:12.193 --> 00:42:12.590
these.
 

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:14.992
You don't know whether it's
worthwhile to change the

00:42:14.992 --> 00:42:17.489
allocation until you know
whether the new technology's

00:42:17.489 --> 00:42:20.295
going to make a profit or not,
and here they had the two

00:42:20.295 --> 00:42:21.130
things separated.
 

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:23.697
They were telling people what
to do before knowing whether

00:42:23.697 --> 00:42:26.222
they made a profit or not
because they didn't have prices

00:42:26.222 --> 00:42:27.980
because there weren't free
markets.

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:32.545
So the bottom line of the
Fisher story is that you take

00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:35.760
this complicated financial
economy,

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:38.476
you reduce it to something very
simple that you learned how to

00:42:38.476 --> 00:42:40.750
do in your freshman year or your
sophomore year,

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.987
solve that, and you go back to
this and you can understand a

00:42:43.987 --> 00:42:45.360
lot about this economy.
 

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.326
That's something that most
people didn't realize at the

00:42:48.326 --> 00:42:50.250
time and still don't realize
now.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.409
So you ask a typical person if
there's inflation,

00:42:52.409 --> 00:42:56.619
that means the dividends next
year is going to be higher,

00:42:56.619 --> 00:42:59.119
is that going to raise the
value of the stock today?

00:42:59.119 --> 00:43:01.331
Just like he said,
"Yes of course because it

00:43:01.331 --> 00:43:03.960
makes the price of the dividends
higher tomorrow."

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:06.621
Fisher would say no,
it doesn't change anything real

00:43:06.621 --> 00:43:07.510
in the economy.
 

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.496
If there's more inflation there
will be a higher nominal

00:43:10.496 --> 00:43:13.210
interest rate,
so discounted by the higher

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.922
interest rate payoffs of the
stock will give you the same

00:43:16.922 --> 00:43:18.579
stock price as before.
 

00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:22.429
So we're going to do a thousand
examples of this,

00:43:22.429 --> 00:43:25.719
but are there any questions
about this?

00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:27.219
Yes?
 

00:43:27.219 --> 00:43:28.916
Student: Can you just
review your arguments at the

00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:29.036
end?
 

00:43:29.036 --> 00:43:30.369
I'm just having a very hard
time reading.

00:43:30.369 --> 00:43:32.000
Prof: Yeah, sorry.
 

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.059
I don't know if this is in the
way, by the way.

00:43:36.059 --> 00:43:39.050
So this is the argument we gave
a few classes ago.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.179
I forgot when.
 

00:43:40.179 --> 00:43:44.146
We said, how do you know that a
final allocation that emerges as

00:43:44.146 --> 00:43:47.170
a competitive equilibrium is
Pareto efficient?

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:50.110
And the argument was if you can
do better--

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:52.010
that means, make everybody
better off--

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:54.268
then each person,
if you look at the value of

00:43:54.268 --> 00:43:57.402
what they're getting under the
new regime it must be more than

00:43:57.402 --> 00:44:00.534
the value of their endowments
otherwise they would have chosen

00:44:00.534 --> 00:44:02.639
the new regime and nobody chose
it.

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:06.775
That means everybody would have
had to pay more for this new

00:44:06.775 --> 00:44:10.630
regime allocation than the value
of their endowments.

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:13.309
So this is more than that for
person A,

00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:16.172
and person B's consumption is
more than the value of this

00:44:16.172 --> 00:44:18.675
endowments,
his extended endowments in the

00:44:18.675 --> 00:44:20.880
Fisher thing under this new
regime,

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:22.590
than the value of his
endowments.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:23.369
You're following that?
 

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:24.039
Student: Yeah.
 

00:44:24.039 --> 00:44:27.619
Prof: Then the next step
was to add all this up.

00:44:27.619 --> 00:44:31.422
Now notice, however the new
technology affects the world,

00:44:31.422 --> 00:44:35.090
obviously people can only eat
what's being produced.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.952
Everything that's being
produced is part of somebody's

00:44:37.952 --> 00:44:38.599
endowment.
 

00:44:38.599 --> 00:44:41.117
So if the new technology,
if Mr. A invents the new

00:44:41.117 --> 00:44:43.882
technology,
he gives up some of his good at

00:44:43.882 --> 00:44:46.579
time 1 to get more of the good
at time 2,

00:44:46.579 --> 00:44:48.742
so his endowment has
changed--but he's got a new

00:44:48.742 --> 00:44:50.880
endowment,
but it's still his endowment.

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.195
So whatever the new allocation
is it has to add up to the new

00:44:54.195 --> 00:44:54.860
endowment.
 

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:58.105
Now, I haven't even bothered to
write down the new endowment,

00:44:58.105 --> 00:45:00.539
but I know the value of that
new endowment.

00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:03.543
Whatever it is,
it's going to be less than the

00:45:03.543 --> 00:45:07.081
value of the old endowment,
because the new technology

00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:08.150
loses money.
 

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:13.382
So the contradiction is the
value of the new endowment after

00:45:13.382 --> 00:45:17.501
the technology is used,
at the old equilibrium prices,

00:45:17.501 --> 00:45:20.760
is lower than the value of the
old endowment at the old

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.090
equilibrium prices.
 

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:26.164
But that, since it's true for
every person in the aggregate,

00:45:26.164 --> 00:45:30.309
that's less than the value of
this new regime consumption.

00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:33.074
And that's a contradiction
because the new regime

00:45:33.074 --> 00:45:35.306
consumption,
that's all this stuff,

00:45:35.306 --> 00:45:38.907
has to equal exactly the total
endowments in the economy to

00:45:38.907 --> 00:45:41.579
begin with,
and that's the contradiction.

00:45:41.579 --> 00:45:43.559
So you can't make everybody
better off.

00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:47.329
That simple argument,
which as I said,

00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:49.878
my advisor Ken Arrow,
another guy at Yale named

00:45:49.878 --> 00:45:51.902
Gerard Debreu--
both of them were working at

00:45:51.902 --> 00:45:53.679
the Cowles Foundation which is
part of Yale--

00:45:53.679 --> 00:45:57.731
that proof that they gave is
the simplest and most important

00:45:57.731 --> 00:45:59.860
argument in all of economics.
 

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:05.489
So we get as a conclusion that,
putting it another way,

00:46:05.489 --> 00:46:19.023
that owners of firms should
maximize the value of their

00:46:19.023 --> 00:46:32.454
firms,
the stock market value of their

00:46:32.454 --> 00:46:36.766
firms,
and thank God they do because

00:46:36.766 --> 00:46:39.617
if they find some new way of
producing that's going to lose

00:46:39.617 --> 00:46:42.518
money it's going to make the
stock market value go down.

00:46:42.518 --> 00:46:45.420
Remember the stock market value
is just the same calculation,

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:47.739
the value of all the output
they're producing.

00:46:47.739 --> 00:46:50.538
If they find some way of losing
money and they try to use it

00:46:50.538 --> 00:46:52.719
it'll make their stock market
value go down.

00:46:52.719 --> 00:46:56.565
That's why they're not going to
do it, and thank God for that

00:46:56.565 --> 00:47:00.409
because it'd be a bad thing for
society if they did do it.

00:47:00.409 --> 00:47:01.489
Yes?
 

00:47:01.489 --> 00:47:03.659
Student: Well,
it seems to me this proof is

00:47:03.659 --> 00:47:06.048
logically flawed because you're
assuming that after the

00:47:06.048 --> 00:47:08.750
inception of a technology the
prices are left unchanged,

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:10.050
but that might not be true.
 

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:14.119
Shouldn't you have some
argument for the prices not

00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:18.110
changing after the inception of
the technology?

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:19.878
Prof: This is a very
bold question,

00:47:19.878 --> 00:47:21.518
telling me that it's a flawed
proof.

00:47:21.518 --> 00:47:24.699
I want to commend you for your
courage.

00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:28.197
As it happens,
however, you've asked the same

00:47:28.197 --> 00:47:32.887
question that somebody asked a
class or two--which is a very

00:47:32.887 --> 00:47:34.320
good question.
 

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.875
So the answer is no,
I shouldn't have changed the

00:47:36.875 --> 00:47:39.590
prices and that's exactly the
point of the proof.

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:44.090
So, yes it's true that after
the new technology is introduced

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:46.780
the prices changes,
everything changes,

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:49.849
but we don't have to worry
about all that complication.

00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:52.922
After all the changes there's
going to be some final

00:47:52.922 --> 00:47:55.936
allocation of goods that
supposedly makes everybody

00:47:55.936 --> 00:47:56.840
better off.
 

00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:58.820
So I can ask the hypothetical
question.

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.177
Would this new allocation to A
at the old prices be something

00:48:03.177 --> 00:48:07.099
he could have afforded,
and the answer must be no...

00:48:07.099 --> 00:48:07.809
Student: All right,
I've got it.

00:48:07.809 --> 00:48:08.420
Prof: Well,
let me just finish.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.333
You see the answer to your
question, but I'm going to say

00:48:11.333 --> 00:48:13.829
it out because it's a very
important question.

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:16.909
The proof is clever precisely
because of what you're asking.

00:48:16.909 --> 00:48:19.579
You have to do something that
you wouldn't have thought of.

00:48:19.579 --> 00:48:22.489
You have this new economy,
and new allocation,

00:48:22.489 --> 00:48:25.541
and new prices,
but the proof says let's do the

00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:29.590
hypothetical thing of looking at
the new allocation at the old

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:30.320
prices.
 

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.326
At the old prices A couldn't
have afforded this new

00:48:33.326 --> 00:48:36.875
allocation because if he could
have, he would have bought it

00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:39.039
because it makes him better off.
 

00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:42.722
So at the old prices A couldn't
have afforded this new regime

00:48:42.722 --> 00:48:43.518
allocation.
 

00:48:43.518 --> 00:48:45.512
Similarly B,
at the old prices,

00:48:45.512 --> 00:48:48.500
couldn't afford this new regime
allocation.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.090
So at the old prices everybody
would have to be spending more

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:55.141
on the new regime allocation
than the value of their

00:48:55.141 --> 00:48:55.980
endowment.
 

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.532
That means at the old prices,
the total in the whole

00:48:59.532 --> 00:49:02.030
society--
by adding it up--of the

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:06.695
expenditures on the new regime
consumptions must be bigger than

00:49:06.695 --> 00:49:09.780
the total value of the old
endowments.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.960
Now that was the contradiction
why at the old endowments

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:14.340
without production you couldn't
make everybody better off.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.849
We'd already have a
contradiction.

00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:17.389
Now we add one more step.
 

00:49:17.389 --> 00:49:23.079
We've got this new technology
that changed the old endowments.

00:49:23.079 --> 00:49:25.451
It changed the old endowments,
but however it changed it we

00:49:25.451 --> 00:49:27.250
don't have to keep track of how
it did it.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.090
It makes the value of the total
endowments even less than it was

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.929
before, so we actually get a
worse contradiction than before.

00:49:32.929 --> 00:49:37.119
So it was a good question,
so I thank you for the

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:38.079
question.
 

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:40.769
Any other questions?
 

00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:41.789
Yes?
 

00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:42.909
Student: Can you raise
the board a little bit?

00:49:42.909 --> 00:49:44.585
Prof: Yes,
I can raise which board,

00:49:44.585 --> 00:49:45.199
not this one?
 

00:49:45.199 --> 00:49:46.590
Student: Yes, that one.
 

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:49.210
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.250
Well, sorry.
 

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:52.800
Student: Oh.
 

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:58.802
Prof: So the bottom line
here is that--let me just

00:49:58.802 --> 00:50:00.090
summarize.
 

00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:04.920
We've spent four classes on
reviewing standard intermediate

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.420
micro and macro.
 

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.581
People never talk about that
stuff when they do

00:50:09.581 --> 00:50:12.949
financial--finance courses,
in typical courses.

00:50:12.949 --> 00:50:15.697
However, Irving Fisher,
the inventor of half of

00:50:15.697 --> 00:50:17.550
finance, that's how he began.
 

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:20.186
And it's going to turn out now,
especially in light of this

00:50:20.186 --> 00:50:22.463
last crisis,
that the best way to understand

00:50:22.463 --> 00:50:25.860
what's going on is to go back to
the original underlying economy.

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.413
So Fisher said you can always
take--we haven't introduced

00:50:28.413 --> 00:50:29.280
risk, by the way.
 

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.340
When that happens things are
going to get more complicated.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:32.719
Fisher couldn't deal with risk.
 

00:50:32.719 --> 00:50:35.467
So without risk,
where everybody's anticipating

00:50:35.467 --> 00:50:39.018
the dividends in the future,
that means that you can always

00:50:39.018 --> 00:50:42.590
reduce a financial economy up
there to a general equilibrium,

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:45.460
which you've been taught before
you got to this course,

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.309
most of you, how to solve.
 

00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:50.344
And now that solution to that
problem with marginal utility

00:50:50.344 --> 00:50:53.641
and Pareto efficiency that tells
us an enormous amount about how

00:50:53.641 --> 00:50:55.840
the stock market and everything
works.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.106
It tells us that the value of
every stock is just the

00:50:59.106 --> 00:51:02.246
discounted real dividends,
discounted at the real rate of

00:51:02.246 --> 00:51:05.081
interest,
or the discounted nominal

00:51:05.081 --> 00:51:08.704
payoffs, cash flows,
discounted at the nominal rate

00:51:08.704 --> 00:51:09.380
of interest.
 

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:13.657
And it tells us that the real
rate of interest is the nominal

00:51:13.657 --> 00:51:16.510
rate divided by the rate of
inflation.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:19.422
And it tells us that it's a
good thing all these owners of

00:51:19.422 --> 00:51:22.030
companies are maximizing profits
or share value,

00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:25.380
which is the same thing,
and that's helping society.

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:28.090
So that's the lesson.
 

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:30.684
A lot of that stuff is going to
change a little bit,

00:51:30.684 --> 00:51:32.110
but that's the basic idea.
 

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.809
So finally let's get to the
point.

00:51:34.809 --> 00:51:40.739
For 2,000 years the public was
confused about interest.

00:51:40.739 --> 00:51:43.652
They said--Aristotle,
one of the greatest geniuses of

00:51:43.652 --> 00:51:46.679
all times, he thought interest
was an unnatural act.

00:51:46.679 --> 00:51:49.606
It was horrible even though,
of course, lots of people in

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.280
Greece were charging interest.
 

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:57.179
Delos, the Delphic oracle was
charging interest,

00:51:57.179 --> 00:51:59.568
would lend money at interest,
and Aristotle and everybody was

00:51:59.568 --> 00:52:01.480
talking about the Delphic oracle
all the time.

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:02.510
They weren't even paying
attention.

00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.831
The Delphic oracle was charging
interest and they were saying

00:52:04.831 --> 00:52:05.800
it's totally unnatural.
 

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:11.219
So three religions all thought
interest was a terrible thing.

00:52:11.219 --> 00:52:14.271
They all thought the just price
was--the nominal rate of

00:52:14.271 --> 00:52:16.934
interest should be 0,
but what Fisher says is the

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:19.320
nominal rate of interest is
irrelevant.

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.699
Nobody cares about the nominal
rate of interest.

00:52:21.699 --> 00:52:24.719
They look at apples today and
apples next year.

00:52:24.719 --> 00:52:26.599
The money and stuff just gets
in the way.

00:52:26.599 --> 00:52:29.554
It's the real rate of interest
that you care about,

00:52:29.554 --> 00:52:33.099
and the real rate of interest
doesn't have to be positive.

00:52:33.099 --> 00:52:35.480
It could be negative like it is
today.

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.132
The real rate of interest,
what are the determinants

00:52:39.132 --> 00:52:43.286
usually of the real rate of
interest if the Federal Reserve

00:52:43.286 --> 00:52:46.010
isn't mucking around with
things,

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:48.838
the real rate of interest is
obtained by solving for

00:52:48.838 --> 00:52:52.054
P_1 and P_2
in this general equilibrium

00:52:52.054 --> 00:52:52.610
model.
 

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:56.909
So what would change the real
rate of interest?

00:52:56.909 --> 00:52:59.349
All you have are the utilities
and the endowments.

00:52:59.349 --> 00:53:01.380
So here's the economy.
 

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:03.659
What would change the real rate
of interest?

00:53:03.659 --> 00:53:08.400
So the first thing Fisher says
is impatience.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.673
So in fact one of his most
famous articles is called an

00:53:11.673 --> 00:53:14.827
Impatience Theory of Interest,
so let's call it that,

00:53:14.827 --> 00:53:16.889
Impatience Theory of Interest.
 

00:53:16.889 --> 00:53:20.940
So Fisher said that in his view
people are impatient.

00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:21.739
Why?
 

00:53:21.739 --> 00:53:24.079
That means an apple today they
thought was more valuable that

00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:24.900
an apple next year.
 

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:25.650
Why?
 

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:30.315
Because of the poor
imagination, it was easy to

00:53:30.315 --> 00:53:34.070
think about eating the apple
today.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:36.568
You can just hold it in your
hand and it's so close,

00:53:36.568 --> 00:53:39.065
but to think about eating it in
a year requires some

00:53:39.065 --> 00:53:39.849
imagination.
 

00:53:39.849 --> 00:53:42.806
They had poor imagination,
and secondly,

00:53:42.806 --> 00:53:45.690
the second main reason is
mortality.

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:51.349
They might die between today
and next year.

00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:52.730
So those are the two main
reasons.

00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:54.527
He gives a bunch of others,
which I'm going to mention

00:53:54.527 --> 00:53:55.967
shortly,
but these are the two most

00:53:55.967 --> 00:53:58.177
interesting ones,
poverty of imagination and the

00:53:58.177 --> 00:54:00.130
fact that you just might die in
between.

00:54:00.130 --> 00:54:00.929
So what does it mean?
 

00:54:00.929 --> 00:54:03.179
An apple next year is not a
sure thing.

00:54:03.179 --> 00:54:05.510
There is the Impatience Theory
of Interest.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:09.719
So he said that's why it makes
sense to have this guy A as

00:54:09.719 --> 00:54:14.150
impatient because he values the
apple today more than a value

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:15.110
tomorrow.
 

00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:18.018
He's got this discount rate,
a half here.

00:54:18.018 --> 00:54:22.480
B's not impatient because the
discount factor is one.

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.693
So he put a discount
factor--actually Fisher didn't

00:54:26.693 --> 00:54:31.472
quite have a discount factor,
he had a more general thing,

00:54:31.472 --> 00:54:36.010
so Samuelson was the one who
introduced the discount factor.

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:38.240
It doesn't matter,
but anyway so a discount factor

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.610
to capture Fisher's idea that
the good next year,

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:44.721
the same apple next year is not
worth as much to A as an apple

00:54:44.721 --> 00:54:45.530
this year.
 

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:51.460
So suppose I change a half to a
third?

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:56.039
What will happen to the real
rate of interest?

00:54:56.039 --> 00:55:03.018
So that makes people more
impatient.

00:55:03.018 --> 00:55:06.920
Why does it make them more
impatient, because now they care

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.409
even less about the good next
year.

00:55:09.409 --> 00:55:10.389
So when did this happen?
 

00:55:10.389 --> 00:55:13.190
In the Reagan years,
the now generation,

00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:16.349
everybody talked about the now
generation.

00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:17.789
People are getting more
impatient.

00:55:17.789 --> 00:55:21.788
So what happens to the real
rate of interest when people get

00:55:21.788 --> 00:55:22.940
more impatient?
 

00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:24.289
Does it go up or down?
 

00:55:24.289 --> 00:55:27.079
Student: It goes up.
 

00:55:27.079 --> 00:55:28.449
Prof: So why does it go
up?

00:55:28.449 --> 00:55:31.099
That's correct.
 

00:55:31.099 --> 00:55:34.853
Student: Because there
needs to be more of an incentive

00:55:34.853 --> 00:55:35.469
to save.
 

00:55:35.469 --> 00:55:39.949
Prof: Right,
but now Fisher would say that a

00:55:39.949 --> 00:55:43.503
little bit more--
he would say it a little more

00:55:43.503 --> 00:55:45.639
formally,
but that's exactly right.

00:55:45.639 --> 00:55:48.184
In order to get anybody to
save, because they want the

00:55:48.184 --> 00:55:51.161
stuff now, you're going to have
to give them a higher real rate

00:55:51.161 --> 00:55:51.929
of interest.
 

00:55:51.929 --> 00:55:53.389
That's exactly right.
 

00:55:53.389 --> 00:55:55.262
So how could you say it in this
economy?

00:55:55.262 --> 00:55:57.393
[next slower]
Remember in this economy,

00:55:57.393 --> 00:56:00.449
this Cobb-Douglas economy,
you could prove it formally.

00:56:00.449 --> 00:56:04.954
You know that if P_2
(let's say) = 1 and we're

00:56:04.954 --> 00:56:08.804
solving for P_1 and
here's the supply,

00:56:08.804 --> 00:56:12.489
this is X_1,
and here's demand.

00:56:12.489 --> 00:56:21.673
So remember X^(A)_1
is going to be something like

00:56:21.673 --> 00:56:31.492
P_1 E^(A)_1
P_2 E^(A)_2

00:56:31.492 --> 00:56:37.510
times 1 over 1 delta where
delta--

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:40.059
what's called delta,
the discount.

00:56:40.059 --> 00:56:43.369
Let's call this delta,
so the discount.

00:56:43.369 --> 00:56:47.730
So to get these to add up to 1
I take 1 delta.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:51.431
So the weight on this thing is
1 over 1 delta times this

00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:53.250
divided by P_1.
 

00:56:53.250 --> 00:57:01.367
So if P_2 is 1 then
this is just equal to 1 over 1

00:57:01.367 --> 00:57:09.074
delta times (E^(A)_1 1
over P_1 times

00:57:09.074 --> 00:57:12.239
E^(A)_2).
 

00:57:12.239 --> 00:57:17.000
So clearly the demand goes down
as P_1 goes--

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.840
as P_2--this is
P_1,

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:22.112
so P_2 = 1,
so if I divide by

00:57:22.112 --> 00:57:23.853
P_1,
P_1 over

00:57:23.853 --> 00:57:24.860
P_1 goes away.
 

00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:26.313
Then I have P_2 over
P_1,

00:57:26.313 --> 00:57:27.735
and if P_2 is 1
that's just 1 over

00:57:27.735 --> 00:57:28.329
P_1.
 

00:57:28.329 --> 00:57:32.269
So obviously as P_1
goes up your demand goes down.

00:57:32.269 --> 00:57:33.340
That's just what you'd expect.
 

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.451
So P_1 goes down the
demand goes up,

00:57:36.451 --> 00:57:39.768
or P_1 goes up the
demand goes down.

00:57:39.768 --> 00:57:43.927
So anyway, if you add up
Cobb-Douglas people it always is

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:44.820
like that.
 

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:48.333
The demand for any good goes up
as the price goes down,

00:57:48.333 --> 00:57:50.219
if its own price goes down.
 

00:57:50.219 --> 00:57:53.835
So if you change delta,
if you make delta smaller,

00:57:53.835 --> 00:57:57.967
that's going to raise demand
for A_1 at the old

00:57:57.967 --> 00:57:58.780
prices.
 

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:01.530
Why?
 

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:05.539
At old equilibrium prices,
the same trick as before,

00:58:05.539 --> 00:58:09.550
at old equilibrium prices
what's going to happen?

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:19.802
Delta goes down like we just
said, implies X^(A)_1

00:58:19.802 --> 00:58:21.539
goes up.
 

00:58:21.539 --> 00:58:31.048
So the guy's demanding more
now, but if he's demanding more

00:58:31.048 --> 00:58:37.733
at the old equilibrium prices--
so at the old equilibrium

00:58:37.733 --> 00:58:40.842
prices he's demanding more so
the only way to clear the market

00:58:40.842 --> 00:58:42.320
is to raise P_1.
 

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:47.260
Implies P_1 must go
up to clear the market.

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:50.230
So this is a formal proof of
what he just said.

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:52.239
So the common sense maybe is
enough for you.

00:58:52.239 --> 00:58:54.969
If you care less about the
future to get anybody to save

00:58:54.969 --> 00:58:57.449
you're going to have to raise
the interest rate.

00:58:57.449 --> 00:59:01.228
To say it formally if we solve
for equilibrium with a lower

00:59:01.228 --> 00:59:03.768
delta at the old equilibrium
prices,

00:59:03.768 --> 00:59:07.355
this guy at the old prices,
A would now shift and try to

00:59:07.355 --> 00:59:08.920
demand more of good 1.
 

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.039
But if he demanded more of good
1 that would mean too much

00:59:12.039 --> 00:59:14.487
demand for good 1,
and the only way to clear the

00:59:14.487 --> 00:59:16.860
price of good 1 is to raise the
price P_1.

00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:19.090
But if you raise P_1
holding P_2 fixed

00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:20.969
that's just P_1 over
P_2,

00:59:20.969 --> 00:59:23.400
so the interest rate,
so the interest rate has to go

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:23.639
up.
 

00:59:23.639 --> 00:59:26.630
So that's your argument made
formal.

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:29.099
So that's his Impatience Theory.
 

00:59:29.099 --> 00:59:32.449
That's the main determinant of
interest according to Fisher.

00:59:32.449 --> 00:59:34.730
What's the second one?
 

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:44.375
He says suppose people are more
optimistic about

00:59:44.375 --> 00:59:48.480
E^(i)_2?
 

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.585
Everybody thinks the world's
going to be much better next

00:59:50.585 --> 00:59:50.849
year.
 

00:59:50.849 --> 00:59:52.530
We're going to have more
endowments.

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:58.722
What do you think is going to
happen to the interest rate,

00:59:58.722 --> 01:00:03.070
the real interest rate,
somebody else?

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:06.320
Student: It'll decrease.
 

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.019
Prof: It'll what?
 

01:00:07.019 --> 01:00:07.789
Student: Decrease.
 

01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:10.849
Prof: Decrease, why?
 

01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:15.628
Student: Because you're
expecting things to be better

01:00:15.628 --> 01:00:17.653
&gt;
 

01:00:17.653 --> 01:00:20.489
signifies people will save
less.

01:00:20.489 --> 01:00:27.018
Prof: To save less or to
save more?

01:00:27.018 --> 01:00:29.079
So let's think of good
X_1.

01:00:29.079 --> 01:00:32.764
If people thought they were
going to be richer at the old

01:00:32.764 --> 01:00:36.911
prices what would they do today
for X_1 demand more or

01:00:36.911 --> 01:00:37.900
less today?
 

01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:40.329
Student: The rate would
go up, right?

01:00:40.329 --> 01:00:41.980
Prof: Yeah,
the right answer is up.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:44.420
He said down,
but let's just figure out why.

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.768
Student: They demand
more &gt;

01:00:47.768 --> 01:00:50.851
Prof: So the reason I
gave the formal argument is

01:00:50.851 --> 01:00:52.869
because you can get confused
here.

01:00:52.869 --> 01:00:55.679
So let's just do the intuitive
one.

01:00:55.679 --> 01:00:57.907
So you had the idea back there
of the intuitive one,

01:00:57.907 --> 01:01:00.092
you just got it backward,
but you were on the right

01:01:00.092 --> 01:01:00.530
track.
 

01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:03.985
The point is there's going to
be so much stuff around for

01:01:03.985 --> 01:01:07.565
people to eat tomorrow,
you've got to get them to want

01:01:07.565 --> 01:01:10.070
to eat all that extra stuff
tomorrow.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:12.382
So you have to give them an
incentive to want to eat all

01:01:12.382 --> 01:01:14.483
that extra stuff tomorrow,
so you have to raise the

01:01:14.483 --> 01:01:15.829
interest rate,
not lower it.

01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:17.489
So you had the right idea,
the wrong conclusion.

01:01:17.489 --> 01:01:20.528
Now, how can you actually give
a formal proof of that so you

01:01:20.528 --> 01:01:21.920
know you're not confused?
 

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.880
Again, like his question,
at the old prices what's going

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.050
to happen to the demand for
X_1?

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:31.588
At the old prices,
since you're going to be so

01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:33.699
rich in the future,
you think you're just

01:01:33.699 --> 01:01:35.922
incredibly rich now,
so of course you're going to

01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:36.860
consume more today.
 

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.780
So there's going to be more
demand today and the endowment

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.960
today hasn't changed.
 

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:43.329
So there's going to be more
demand today with the same

01:01:43.329 --> 01:01:45.827
endowment today,
so therefore in order to clear

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:49.068
the market today you're going to
have to raise P_1

01:01:49.068 --> 01:01:52.639
relative to P_2 so the
interest rate's got to go up.

01:01:52.639 --> 01:01:55.349
So is that clear?
 

01:01:55.349 --> 01:02:00.400
It's a little surprising,
so let me say that again.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.659
If you increase the endowments
tomorrow the supply today of

01:02:04.659 --> 01:02:08.699
goods hasn't changed,
but people are richer tomorrow.

01:02:08.699 --> 01:02:11.360
So clearly they're going to
consume this fraction of their

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:11.780
wealth.
 

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.768
Their wealth is up.
 

01:02:12.768 --> 01:02:15.244
You tell anybody,
"You're going to be rich

01:02:15.244 --> 01:02:15.889
next year.
 

01:02:15.889 --> 01:02:17.916
You're going to be worth a
fortune,"

01:02:17.916 --> 01:02:19.795
the normal person,
Cobb-Douglas person,

01:02:19.795 --> 01:02:22.163
is going to consume more stuff
today anticipating that he's

01:02:22.163 --> 01:02:23.469
going to be so rich tomorrow.
 

01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:25.940
He's going to borrow against
tomorrow's wealth.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.985
And so therefore,
in order to clear today's

01:02:27.985 --> 01:02:30.030
market where the supply hasn't
changed,

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:33.085
with all these people trying
eat more today you have to raise

01:02:33.085 --> 01:02:34.969
today's price relative to
tomorrow.

01:02:34.969 --> 01:02:37.650
That's, raise the real interest
rate.

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:42.380
So what's a third example?
 

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.940
This is Fisher's most famous
one.

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:52.168
Suppose you transfer money,
transfer wealth,

01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:55.530
from poor to rich.
 

01:02:55.530 --> 01:03:02.380
What would happen?
 

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.869
We have to make an extra
assumption here.

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:08.510
Fisher felt that the people who
were rich were rich because they

01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:09.139
were patient.
 

01:03:09.139 --> 01:03:12.230
They could charge interest and
get lots of money.

01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:15.686
So if you change wealth you
take away some money from the

01:03:15.686 --> 01:03:16.119
poor.
 

01:03:16.119 --> 01:03:20.242
That's what's happened in the
American economy over the last

01:03:20.242 --> 01:03:21.429
15 or 20 years.
 

01:03:21.429 --> 01:03:23.822
The rich have gotten richer and
the poor are pretty much back

01:03:23.822 --> 01:03:24.820
where they were before.
 

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:27.889
So suppose the rich get rich at
the expense of the poor?

01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:33.239
What's that going to do to the
real rate of interest?

01:03:33.239 --> 01:03:34.469
I'll--hang on a second.
 

01:03:34.469 --> 01:03:35.369
Yep?
 

01:03:35.369 --> 01:03:36.679
Student: That would make
it lower.

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:37.530
Prof: That's going to
lower it.

01:03:37.530 --> 01:03:38.250
Why is that?
 

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:45.099
Student:
&gt;

01:03:45.099 --> 01:03:48.878
Prof: So there's an
intuitive way of saying it which

01:03:48.878 --> 01:03:52.344
is his which is that the rich,
because they're patient,

01:03:52.344 --> 01:03:53.768
are probably the lenders.
 

01:03:53.768 --> 01:03:57.873
Now they're even more willing
to lend and so the interest rate

01:03:57.873 --> 01:04:01.440
has to go down to get these
other people to borrow.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.317
A formal way of saying it is
that if you transfer money from

01:04:06.317 --> 01:04:08.467
the rich [correction:
poor]

01:04:08.467 --> 01:04:10.864
to the poor [correction:
rich]

01:04:10.864 --> 01:04:15.563
that means the poor guys--
the rich guys always consume a

01:04:15.563 --> 01:04:19.809
higher proportion in the future
because they're more patient.

01:04:19.809 --> 01:04:22.449
So a more patient guy will
consume more in the future.

01:04:22.449 --> 01:04:27.811
So if you take away wealth from
an impatient guy and give it to

01:04:27.811 --> 01:04:31.789
a patient guy you're going to
increase the--

01:04:31.789 --> 01:04:39.768
the economy's going to be more
in the hands of the patient

01:04:39.768 --> 01:04:42.902
people,
and so the patient people--the

01:04:42.902 --> 01:04:44.289
mix is going to change.
 

01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:47.106
People on average are more
patient than they were before so

01:04:47.106 --> 01:04:49.731
on average in the economy
they're going to consume less

01:04:49.731 --> 01:04:52.695
than they were of today's good
and so the shift is going to be

01:04:52.695 --> 01:04:54.219
in this direction,
right?

01:04:54.219 --> 01:04:57.550
Because you've made people,
a lot of them impatient,

01:04:57.550 --> 01:05:00.128
a lot of patient,
you've increased the patient

01:05:00.128 --> 01:05:02.480
ones and decreased the impatient
ones,

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.481
so in balance you're going to
decrease demand today because it

01:05:05.481 --> 01:05:08.088
was the impatient ones who
wanted to eat today and the

01:05:08.088 --> 01:05:09.860
other guys were willing to wait.
 

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:13.135
Now the guys who aren't willing
to wait these guys don't have

01:05:13.135 --> 01:05:13.789
any money.
 

01:05:13.789 --> 01:05:16.385
They're the ones doing all the
consuming today and now they

01:05:16.385 --> 01:05:18.711
can't afford to do much
consuming, so you're going to

01:05:18.711 --> 01:05:20.010
reduce consumption today.
 

01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:22.467
So to get the market to clear
again you have to lower the

01:05:22.467 --> 01:05:23.610
interest rate this time.
 

01:05:23.610 --> 01:05:27.070
So those are three famous
conclusions of Fisher,

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:29.949
more impatient people,
higher interest rate,

01:05:29.949 --> 01:05:33.760
more optimistic about the
future, higher interest rate,

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.059
transfers from the poor to the
rich lower interest rate.

01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:41.380
So what happens to the stock
market in this case?

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.369
Suppose people are more
impatient.

01:05:43.369 --> 01:05:45.929
Does the stock market go up or
down?

01:05:45.929 --> 01:05:51.530
Student: Down.
 

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:55.606
Prof: Down,
because the stock market price

01:05:55.606 --> 01:05:59.090
is just this,
the real interest rate times

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:00.619
the dividends.
 

01:06:00.619 --> 01:06:03.722
So I haven't told you the
dividends changed,

01:06:03.722 --> 01:06:07.907
so if the dividends are the
same and the real interest rate

01:06:07.907 --> 01:06:11.300
has gone up the stock market has
gone down.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.630
Suppose people are more
optimistic about the future,

01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:17.112
so not about the stocks
producing more,

01:06:17.112 --> 01:06:20.639
but about whether there's more
stuff in the world?

01:06:20.639 --> 01:06:23.760
Their own endowments will be
bigger.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.570
The stock market is going to go
down.

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:28.925
That ones a little subtler
because they could be optimistic

01:06:28.925 --> 01:06:32.110
about the stocks producing more,
so that's ambiguous.

01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:33.050
So let's do the third.
 

01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:36.115
Suppose you transfer wealth
from the poor to the rich,

01:06:36.115 --> 01:06:38.719
what's going to happen to the
stock market?

01:06:38.719 --> 01:06:39.340
It's going to go up.
 

01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.030
So what happened in the last 20
years?

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:43.170
The rich got richer,
the poor got poorer,

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:46.110
the interest rates got lower
and lower and the stock market

01:06:46.110 --> 01:06:48.900
got higher and higher just as
Fisher would have said.

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:55.275
So I want to now end with just
Fisher and Shakespeare,

01:06:55.275 --> 01:07:01.050
so I'm going to go over just a
couple minutes.

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:12.199
Maybe I'll have to start with
Shakespeare.

01:07:12.199 --> 01:07:15.579
So Fisher's theory of interest,
as I said,

01:07:15.579 --> 01:07:23.170
was making sense of thousands
of years of confusion,

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:27.050
so the idea is that interest is
nothing other--

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:28.260
you shouldn't think of nominal
interest.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.789
People look through all that.
 

01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:32.539
They look at the real rate of
interest and the real rate of

01:07:32.539 --> 01:07:35.384
interest is just the ratio of
two prices just like everything

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:39.019
else in equilibrium,
so therefore there is no such

01:07:39.019 --> 01:07:42.068
thing as--
it's an important price like

01:07:42.068 --> 01:07:44.913
anything else,
but maybe I forgot to say it,

01:07:44.913 --> 01:07:47.110
there's no such thing as a just
price.

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.733
The price, in fact,
that equilibrium finds is the

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:52.958
best price because that's the
price that's going to lead new

01:07:52.958 --> 01:07:55.802
firms and inventors to use
technologies that help the

01:07:55.802 --> 01:07:58.644
economy as opposed to hurting
the economy and wasting

01:07:58.644 --> 01:07:59.630
resources.
 

01:07:59.630 --> 01:08:02.384
So the price that the market
finds is the just price and the

01:08:02.384 --> 01:08:04.952
real rate of interest is the
right real rate of interest

01:08:04.952 --> 01:08:07.425
provided that people are
rational and see through this

01:08:07.425 --> 01:08:07.940
veil.
 

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:11.173
So, why is it that the real
rate of interest is typically

01:08:11.173 --> 01:08:11.809
positive?
 

01:08:11.809 --> 01:08:15.896
Well, it's because,
as I said, people are impatient

01:08:15.896 --> 01:08:18.350
and these different reasons.
 

01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:21.007
Now Fisher said one other
reason that screws up the real

01:08:21.007 --> 01:08:23.472
rate of interest is people
sometimes get confused by

01:08:23.472 --> 01:08:24.149
inflation.
 

01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:25.310
So this is an aside.
 

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:29.779
He said that all contracts
should be inflation indexed,

01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:34.134
and he forced his Yale
secretary and his secretaries at

01:08:34.134 --> 01:08:37.439
his company to change their
contracts--

01:08:37.439 --> 01:08:38.720
I guess his Yale secretary is
probably wrong,

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.770
the secretaries at his
business, Remington,

01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:46.757
he forced them to accept deals
where their wage was indexed to

01:08:46.757 --> 01:08:47.738
inflation.
 

01:08:47.738 --> 01:08:49.956
And of course the Great
Depression happened and all of

01:08:49.956 --> 01:08:53.457
the prices collapsed,
and so all his secretaries got

01:08:53.457 --> 01:08:58.457
less money out of the deal so he
wasn't too popular with them

01:08:58.457 --> 01:08:59.288
either.
 

01:08:59.288 --> 01:09:02.880
He says impatience is a
fundamental attribute of human

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:03.488
nature.
 

01:09:03.488 --> 01:09:05.490
As long as people like things
today rather than tomorrow

01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:06.618
there's going to be interest.
 

01:09:06.618 --> 01:09:09.440
So interest is,
as it were, impatience

01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.261
crystallized into a market rate,
and the reasons for impatience

01:09:14.261 --> 01:09:16.854
are this foresight,
lack of foresight,

01:09:16.854 --> 01:09:20.472
possibility of dying and then
he talks about self control and

01:09:20.472 --> 01:09:23.261
stuff like that,
the greater the foresight,

01:09:23.261 --> 01:09:23.868
etcetera.
 

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:27.492
Now he has this racist view of
the world, which I think is

01:09:27.492 --> 01:09:28.698
worth mentioning.
 

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:33.201
So he compares the Scotch and
the Irish, so the Scotch are

01:09:33.201 --> 01:09:37.938
patient, the Irish are totally
impatient, no self-control and

01:09:37.938 --> 01:09:40.149
it gets worse and worse.
 

01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:41.279
I can't show you all of this.
 

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:44.693
So Holland, Scotland,
England, France these are all

01:09:44.693 --> 01:09:47.560
the places his family was
probably from.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.590
They're incredibly patient.
 

01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:49.198
They're wonderful.
 

01:09:49.198 --> 01:09:51.782
They've got low rates of
interest, incredibly thrifty

01:09:51.782 --> 01:09:52.229
people.
 

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:54.720
Then you look at all these
other dreadful people,

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.500
Chinese, Indians,
Blacks, Java Southerners,

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:02.067
American Indians and then
Greeks and Italians he mentions

01:10:02.067 --> 01:10:03.742
later,
hopeless, high rates of

01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:05.500
interest, incredibly impatient.
 

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:09.573
So anyway, the patient
accumulate wealth and by waiting

01:10:09.573 --> 01:10:12.970
and lending they make production
possible,

01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:15.295
because the people with all the
good ideas where are they going

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:16.420
to get the money to produce?
 

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:19.234
They're going to get it out of
the patient people who are

01:10:19.234 --> 01:10:20.140
willing to wait.
 

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:23.533
If you can wait should I talk
for five more minutes or do you

01:10:23.533 --> 01:10:24.270
need to go?
 

01:10:24.270 --> 01:10:26.698
I was going to do my--maybe I
should let you go.

01:10:26.698 --> 01:10:28.359
Anyway, so what I was going to
say last,

01:10:28.359 --> 01:10:31.073
I won't say it,
is that Shakespeare anticipated

01:10:31.073 --> 01:10:34.317
all of Fisher's Impatience
Theory of Interest and went a

01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.319
step further.
 

01:10:35.319 --> 01:10:37.305
He said, "Well,
that's great but you should

01:10:37.305 --> 01:10:39.800
take into account that people
won't keep their promises,

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:42.310
and if they don't keep their
promises you need collateral,

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:44.863
and if you need collateral
that's going to change a lot of

01:10:44.863 --> 01:10:47.238
stuff," and Shakespeare
already had a lot of that

01:10:47.238 --> 01:10:48.869
figured out,
and most of this course is

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:50.457
going to be about,
believe it or not,

01:10:50.457 --> 01:10:53.364
what Shakespeare had to say
about the rate of interest and

01:10:53.364 --> 01:10:54.079
collateral.
 

01:10:54.079 --> 01:10:55.600
Okay, next time.
 

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:01.000

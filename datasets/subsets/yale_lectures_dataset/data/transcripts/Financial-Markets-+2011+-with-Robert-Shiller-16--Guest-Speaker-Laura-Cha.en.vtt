00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:09.000
All right, I'm very pleased to
have today Laura Cha, who is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.400
connected to us electronically,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.033
live from Hong Kong.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:15.900
It's 9 pm in Hong Kong.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:23.333
Well, we've already talked about
Laura, she's one of the

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:27.933
most distinguished executives
in Asia.

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.400
She is on the Executive
Council of Hong Kong.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.200
She's a director at HSBC, she's
served on the China

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.133
Security's Regulatory
Commission, and recently at

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:46.767
the National People's Congress
of China, which is a

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:49.267
remarkable set of
achievements for

00:00:49.267 --> 00:00:53.200
someone, for any one person.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.600
And I understand, that she is
the first Hong Kong citizen to

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.933
serve in the government of
the People's Republic.

00:01:06.467 --> 00:01:11.467
But I guess, the really big
thing that comes to my mind

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.633
is, that HSBC is one of the
most important and biggest

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:18.067
banks in the world.

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:21.467
And I looked it up and I found
that five branch offices of

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:27.567
HSBC are within a few
miles of right here.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.400
Anyway, Laura --

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.267
I'm looking at you there --

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:38.567
why don't you introduce
yourself, talk about what you

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:42.400
do, and what your thoughts are
about the financial situation,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.767
and then we will turn it
over to questions.

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:48.433
LAURA CHA: OK.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:51.400
First of all, good morning
to you all.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.200
Thank you, Bob, for inviting me
here, via electronically.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.233
It is my honor too have the
opportunity to talk to you.

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:06.633
When I was invited to give
this talk, I went on the

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:10.800
internet and saw that your
course syllabus is very

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.367
comprehensive, and I would
imagine that at the end of the

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:19.533
course you would have covered or
will cover just about every

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:22.633
aspect of the financial
markets.

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:25.567
And you will have a good idea of
the function of the markets

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:28.100
and how it works.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.633
What I want to do in the next 20
minutes or so, is really to

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:36.233
give you an overview of what
it is like to work in the

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:40.467
financial markets, to have a job
in the financial market,

00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:44.700
and perhaps, eventually, you may
want to have a career in

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.800
financial services.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.233
And then, after that I would
be happy to answer any

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.933
questions that Bob, you,
or anyone of you want

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:57.733
to raise with me.

00:02:57.733 --> 00:03:02.367
I think, when one talks about
a career or job in the

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:04.733
financial services,
one tends to think

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:06.867
about the private sector.

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:11.367
The banks, the investment banks,
the fund management

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:18.500
companies, and, of course, the
trading, the traders, both in

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.100
terms of stocks, futures,
options.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.400
Of course, in the last decade,
hedge funds, private equity.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.067
There's no question
that the private

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:31.400
sector is very exciting.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.467
There's no question that a job
or career in financial

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:41.133
services in the private sector
is, by the most of any

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:44.200
standard, is very financially
rewarding.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.867
But what I really want to talk
to you about, is the other

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:51.267
side of the financial markets,
which is the public sector

00:03:51.267 --> 00:03:56.567
side, and I want to share with
you my own experience in the

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:58.700
public sector.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.833
When one talks about financial
services, as I mentioned, we

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:04.467
talk about the banks -- the
intermediaries, what we call

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:05.233
the intermediaries --

00:04:05.233 --> 00:04:07.367
the practitioners, people
who practice in

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.567
the financial market.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:12.267
If you are a college graduate,
typically, if you go to one of

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:16.800
these firms, you start out
as a research assistant.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.933
You do research.

00:04:18.933 --> 00:04:22.700
If you are in a bank you will
learn to read, how to

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.900
interpret balance sheets.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.333
How to decide, when people come
to you for loans, how you

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:35.067
evaluate them, and what is the
creditworthiness of the

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:37.033
potential client, whether
you should or

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:38.667
should not lend money.

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.333
If you go to work for a private
equity firm, you do

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.033
the same kind of research,
except

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.700
that it's for companies.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.567
You will help the firm decide
whether a particular

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:54.867
transaction is worthy
to take on.

00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:57.500
And in between, of course,
there are all kinds of

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:04.200
financial mechanisms, or tools,
products, as one would

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.067
say, that you devise, that the
markets devise to facilitate

00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:09.833
these financial services.

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:14.467
And those have been covered in
your course, I can see that.

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:18.167
But, as I mentioned, the other
side of the financial

00:05:18.167 --> 00:05:20.567
services, the other side of
the financial market, is

00:05:20.567 --> 00:05:22.200
really the regulators.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.633
The public sector side,
the policy makers, the

00:05:26.633 --> 00:05:31.267
standard-setters, bodies such
as the Financial Accounting

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:33.400
Standards Board.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.367
And all of these are the other
part of the equation, which

00:05:37.367 --> 00:05:41.033
help to make the financial
market function well.

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:45.967
And it is important for the
public sector to have equally

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:47.767
bright students.

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:52.767
I think, some of us get
a little worried.

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:55.633
In the last decade, a lot of the
bright students, who want

00:05:55.633 --> 00:05:57.600
to go into financial
services, all go

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.433
into the private sector.

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:02.033
The public sector is important,
because the

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:06.133
regulators and policy setters
help ensure that the market

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:09.667
functions in an orderly
fashion.

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:12.433
We want to make clear as
regulators and policy setters

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:17.333
-- we want to make sure that the
market not only functions

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:19.067
properly --

00:06:19.067 --> 00:06:22.900
that the playing field is level,
that the rules are

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.100
clear, so that financial
service, and finance, can

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.200
indeed perform its function
in society.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.567
And that's where, in the U.S.,
when we have the SEC, the

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:41.933
CFTC, the Fed, and of course
the exchanges, and, not to

00:06:41.933 --> 00:06:44.333
mention, the Department of
Justice, the State Attorney

00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:47.200
General's Office, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.700
What the public sector does,
is really to make sure that

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.833
people in the private sector,
in the banks, in the

00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:57.667
investment banks, in the fund
management, and so on, they

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:02.167
behave properly, so that the
investors are treated fairly

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:03.300
and equally.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.333
So that everyone is entitled or
is given in the same kind

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:14.433
of information, so that no one
particular group has an

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:16.500
advantage over the
other group.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.867
And that's where investor
protection comes in, corporate

00:07:19.867 --> 00:07:21.400
governance comes in.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.500
And I myself --

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:28.767
my career has largely been in
the public sector side.

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:31.500
Although I started out
as a lawyer --

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.867
I was trained as a lawyer and
I practiced as a lawyer for

00:07:35.867 --> 00:07:40.933
seven, eight years in Foreign
Direct Investment into China

00:07:40.933 --> 00:07:42.100
in the '80s.

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.467
And I dealt with a lot of
multinationals on the

00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:50.433
corporate side, on
the finance side.

00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:56.267
My foray into the public sector
as a regulator came out

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:56.733
of the blue.

00:07:56.733 --> 00:08:02.400
I was headhunted to join the
newly found Securities and

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.067
Futures Commission
in Hong Kong.

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.033
That was 1990.

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:11.567
And I thought, I would do it for
a couple years, learn to

00:08:11.567 --> 00:08:14.333
broaden my horizon, and see what
it is like to be in the

00:08:14.333 --> 00:08:15.967
public sector.

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:20.667
And I enjoyed what I did,
and I stayed 10 years.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:24.133
And then, I was made an offer by
the central government, and

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:29.133
I went to work for the Chinese
regulator for almost four

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:33.867
years, and became the first
person outside of Mainland

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:35.567
China to join the Chinese
government.

00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:42.867
So, I had a total of 14 years of
experience as a regulator.

00:08:42.867 --> 00:08:46.533
And I have to say that it has
been hugely gratifying,

00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:52.467
because as a regulator and a
policy setter I was able to

00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:56.333
facilitate the development
of markets in Hong Kong.

00:08:56.333 --> 00:09:00.567
In the early days, Hong
Kong was a --

00:09:00.567 --> 00:09:03.200
in the early days, I mean in
the '70s and the '80s --

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.433
Hong Kong was largely
a local market.

00:09:07.433 --> 00:09:11.000
The international players like
Goldman Sachs and Morgan

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.900
Stanley, they came and they
went, they took a look and

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:18.433
decided the Hong Kong market
was too small for them.

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:25.633
All that took a change in
1992, when the Chinese

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:29.433
government decided that they
want to use the Hong Kong

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:38.033
market as a way to help
transform or reform the

00:09:38.033 --> 00:09:40.067
state-owned enterprises.

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:43.800
And by that time, I was already
at the Securities and

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.167
Futures Commission of Hong
Kong and because of my

00:09:46.167 --> 00:09:50.367
experience working in the
Chinese market in the '80s, I

00:09:50.367 --> 00:09:53.433
became the only person who was
the familiar enough with the

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:58.300
Chinese market to take on that
responsibility of really

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.667
designing a structure for
state-owned enterprises in

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:07.667
China to become listed companies
in Hong Kong.

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:11.233
And it was ground
breaking work.

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:14.533
At the time, we knew that
it was very important.

00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:20.333
We didn't know how important
it would become later on.

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:24.867
Some 20 years later, the Hong
Kong market now is a totally

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:26.333
international market.

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:35.067
All the big players are here,
and more than half of our

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:40.733
market capitalization comes
from Chinese enterprises.

00:10:40.733 --> 00:10:45.167
More than half of the turnover
on our stock exchange are from

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:48.733
Chinese related companies,
Chinese companies directly or

00:10:48.733 --> 00:10:53.533
what we call ''red chips.'' So,
the coming of the Chinese

00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:58.300
enterprises to Hong Kong really
transformed not only to

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.367
state-owned enterprises in
China, but also the nature and

00:11:03.367 --> 00:11:06.433
stature of the Hong
Kong market.

00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:10.800
I think today most people will
recognize that Hong Kong is an

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.867
important financial center.

00:11:12.867 --> 00:11:16.800
And I would say that, without
the Chinese enterprises, we

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.367
would still have been a very
local market, because our

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:23.733
economy itself, Hong
Kong's economy, has

00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:24.767
not been that big.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:29.133
It really is what had happened
in China that has propelled

00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:30.600
our change.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.067
And as a regulator, I was
fortunate to have that

00:11:34.067 --> 00:11:39.000
opportunity and to help
structure the market and

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.833
spearhead changes.

00:11:40.833 --> 00:11:45.833
The other thing that I did as a
regulator in Hong Kong was,

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:52.867
in the late '90s, '98, '99, and
2000, there was a wave of

00:11:52.867 --> 00:11:55.000
demutualizations of
stock exchanges

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.567
throughout the world.

00:11:56.567 --> 00:12:00.467
And I helped demutualize the
stock and futures exchange in

00:12:00.467 --> 00:12:03.567
Hong Kong, merged them together,
together with our

00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:06.633
clearinghouse, and
we became --

00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:09.900
the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
became a listed company.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:14.833
Today, as an exchange, it has
the largest market cap in the

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:18.033
world, more than the New York
Stock Exchange and the London

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:20.600
Stock Exchange.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.100
And then, when I went to China,
the market was in the

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.667
nascent state, bearing in
mind it was a socialist,

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:31.267
communist-socialist, country.

00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:34.967
Capitalism was the new thing and
stock market was an even

00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:37.967
newer thing in 1991.

00:12:37.967 --> 00:12:42.300
So, I kind of witnessed, and
then later on was fortunate

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.633
enough, when I went to work in
the Chinese government, to

00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:49.533
participate in that grow
of the Chinese market.

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:53.867
And what I did in my almost
four years as a Chinese

00:12:53.867 --> 00:12:58.200
regulator was to promote
corporate governance.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.733
I introduced quarterly
reporting, the requirement of

00:13:01.733 --> 00:13:05.800
independence of executive
directors, and it

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800
was exciting times.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.133
What I want to say really
is the public sector

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:15.200
work that would --

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.367
at least for me, I felt that
I was making a difference.

00:13:18.367 --> 00:13:26.633
I was able to help the market
change, and if things were not

00:13:26.633 --> 00:13:34.600
right, I felt that I had the
ability to make things right,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.167
to make things correct.

00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:38.667
Not always successful,
I have to say.

00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:42.800
But what I want to really
impress upon you all is that,

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:46.967
while the private sector work
in the financial services is

00:13:46.967 --> 00:13:50.333
extremely financially rewarding,
in the public

00:13:50.333 --> 00:13:55.533
sector it's less so, but on a
different level, I think the

00:13:55.533 --> 00:13:59.000
policymakers do perform
a social good.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And the good thing about the
United States is, there is a

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.733
lot of interchange between the
public and private sectors.

00:14:07.733 --> 00:14:11.100
People do move from the private
sector to the public

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.867
sector, and back again.

00:14:13.867 --> 00:14:17.667
I think that's what makes the
U.S. market vibrant, among

00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:18.933
other things.

00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:23.100
And I think, it is a tradition
that many other countries and

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.133
jurisdictions want to emulate.

00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:29.067
Namely, the people, who have
been in the private sector,

00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:34.867
who have the market experience
needed in the public sector.

00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:37.400
In other words, you cannot have
regulators, who have very

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.067
little knowledge of how
the market works.

00:14:41.067 --> 00:14:43.200
At the same time, those people,
who have been in the

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:49.633
public sector, have kind of
instilled on them the

00:14:49.633 --> 00:14:54.400
discipline of an orderly market,
doing the right thing

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.267
for the market.

00:14:55.267 --> 00:14:59.333
And that, when you have it
transplanted or being brought

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:02.767
back into the private sector,
it is also a good

00:15:02.767 --> 00:15:03.967
thing for the --

00:15:03.967 --> 00:15:07.133
and healthy for the
market as well.

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:11.300
The other thing that I want to
really talk about, other than

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.100
the public sector work, and as
a career choice or a job

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:22.300
choice in the financial
services, is really the

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:26.833
globalized nature of the
markets these days.

00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:30.733
I think, in my days, when I was
going to college and law

00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:36.167
school in the United States, the
U.S. was, and I don't mean

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:41.367
to say that it is no longer,
everybody looked to the U.S.

00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:45.433
to be the center of the world.

00:15:45.433 --> 00:15:48.267
Particularly in financial
services, everything happened

00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:52.167
in the U.S., and to a large
extent it still does, but I

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:55.100
think the world outside
the U.S. has

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.833
undergone a lot of changes.

00:15:56.833 --> 00:16:02.200
A globalized market means, that
today young people will

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.267
find equally interesting and
exciting work opportunities in

00:16:06.267 --> 00:16:09.533
financial services outside
of the United States.

00:16:09.533 --> 00:16:14.167
I think in my days, in the '80s,
certainly people, when

00:16:14.167 --> 00:16:17.367
they say they want to work
outside the U.S., it would be

00:16:17.367 --> 00:16:23.767
in a mature market like Europe,
the U.K. or Japan.

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:27.833
I think, increasingly more
so in the last decade,

00:16:27.833 --> 00:16:31.433
opportunities in Asia and Latin
American in financial

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:35.967
services have become
very exciting for

00:16:35.967 --> 00:16:38.267
young graduates anywhere.

00:16:38.267 --> 00:16:43.467
And I would say, if you are
equipped as a young graduate

00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:47.067
and you wanted a career in
financial services, I think

00:16:47.067 --> 00:16:51.967
you should not rule out the
possibility of working in a

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:55.967
foreign country, in the emerging
market in particular.

00:16:55.967 --> 00:17:01.767
I think, in an emerging market
you will learn, in a way,

00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:04.767
faster, because you would be
given more opportunities, more

00:17:04.767 --> 00:17:08.400
responsibility, at
an early age.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.300
Your learning curve
will be steeper.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:17.167
And it is also interesting, as
well as frustrating, I have to

00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:21.467
say, working in a developing
market.

00:17:21.467 --> 00:17:23.567
There are things that you think
that you can do, and

00:17:23.567 --> 00:17:27.767
then there are things, that the
rules are not as clear,

00:17:27.767 --> 00:17:31.400
and the environment and the
people around you are not as

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.300
sophisticated or educated
as you are.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.233
But I think, in today's world,
the globalized market means

00:17:40.233 --> 00:17:44.067
that the opportunities are
everywhere, and I think

00:17:44.067 --> 00:17:48.200
particularly the emerging
markets will offer a lot of

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.367
opportunities.

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:54.933
Bob, I don't know whether this
is enough as an introduction

00:17:54.933 --> 00:17:57.533
for us to carry on discussion,
or how do

00:17:57.533 --> 00:17:59.967
you think about that?

00:17:59.967 --> 00:18:01.033
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Yes, very good.

00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:03.567
I'll turn and face the class.

00:18:03.567 --> 00:18:07.433
I can't see you very well,
but I thought it was very

00:18:07.433 --> 00:18:10.867
interesting hearing
your comments.

00:18:10.867 --> 00:18:15.367
What particularly struck me
was your emphasis on the

00:18:15.367 --> 00:18:17.167
public sector and about
regulators.

00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:21.500
And it reminds me --

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.167
I visited the SEC once,
recently, in the U.S., and I

00:18:25.167 --> 00:18:28.333
had lunch with people there,
in Washington.

00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:30.633
And I found that a lot of them
had worked in the private

00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:34.333
sector in the past, and I was
starting to wonder they

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:36.600
must've taken a big pay cut.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.000
Why are you here at the SEC?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
It crossed my mind, maybe
they're losers, maybe they

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.600
didn't make it in Wall
Street, they can't --

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.967
but when I talked with them,
I got a different idea.

00:18:48.967 --> 00:18:53.200
Maybe they're here, because
they find all aspects of

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:57.500
finance exciting, and maybe the
purpose of life isn't to

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.300
make a huge amount of money.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.300
So, I wonder if you agree
with my assessment.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:07.667
I mean, why do people work in
the public sector anyway, if

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:08.333
pay is lower?

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:12.100
And that's a very open and big
question, maybe you have a

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.167
response to that.

00:19:15.167 --> 00:19:21.133
LAURA CHA: I think, there are a
couple of reasons for that.

00:19:21.133 --> 00:19:26.667
I think, one, that a career
in the public

00:19:26.667 --> 00:19:29.000
sector need not be permanent.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.667
You can work in the public
sector for a number of years,

00:19:31.667 --> 00:19:34.367
and then go out into the
private sectors.

00:19:34.367 --> 00:19:38.767
And your public sector
experience is hugely

00:19:38.767 --> 00:19:42.067
marketable, if we could
use that term.

00:19:42.067 --> 00:19:45.067
I know that, particularly
in the U.S., if you had

00:19:45.067 --> 00:19:49.233
experience with the CFTC
and the SEC or the Fed

00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:50.100
you are very --

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.467
I mean, provided that you're
not really just in the

00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:56.733
technical aspect and you are
in the broad policy aspect.

00:19:56.733 --> 00:20:00.400
I think that you have a very
marketable skill that people

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:04.667
in the private sector don't
necessarily have. If you

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:07.567
change jobs in the private
sector, one bank and another,

00:20:07.567 --> 00:20:11.333
one private equity and another
hedge fund, they would be more

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:14.167
or less the same, but I think
in the public sector that's

00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:15.567
where the difference is.

00:20:15.567 --> 00:20:16.633
That's one.

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:20.200
The practical aspect
is, of course, it

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.533
is more steady work.

00:20:24.633 --> 00:20:25.900
The financial --

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.767
how should I say?

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:31.033
Yes, the financial reward is
huge in the private sector but

00:20:31.033 --> 00:20:34.800
also it is subject
to a cyclical --

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.867
when the market is down, there
are massive layoffs.

00:20:38.867 --> 00:20:42.333
And the public sector is
a little more steady.

00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:46.600
So, I think it could
be a different

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:48.567
phase in one's career.

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:51.567
A certain phase you might want
to have a more steady --

00:20:51.567 --> 00:20:54.833
or you want to accumulate enough
experience before you

00:20:54.833 --> 00:20:57.433
go out into the private
sector, or vice versa.

00:20:57.433 --> 00:21:01.233
And I have seen, among my
friends, among the regulators,

00:21:01.233 --> 00:21:04.833
some people felt that they have
made enough money, enough

00:21:04.833 --> 00:21:08.167
is a relative term, they make
enough in the private sector

00:21:08.167 --> 00:21:12.167
and they want to go in the
public sector for a few years.

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:14.267
I think that's also one
of the reasons.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.567
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Listening to what you said, it

00:21:19.567 --> 00:21:24.100
seems to me, in some sense,
working in the public sector

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.033
is an opportunity but also
maybe a mission.

00:21:28.033 --> 00:21:32.233
When I'm thinking of what you
helped achieve for China, I

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:35.667
think it's a really important
mission in that you are

00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:39.400
getting the financial markets
working right.

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.700
And the things you talked
about, like independent

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.100
directors on Chinese companies,
is a way of

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.667
combating the problem of
corruption -- you didn't use

00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:50.100
the word corruption, maybe
that's too strong of a word.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.233
But when things aren't
up an up.

00:21:52.233 --> 00:21:55.267
And I thought that part of the
motivation that maybe --

00:21:55.267 --> 00:21:58.200
I'm sure you have, and maybe
you can confirm this, it's

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.800
just a sense of being part of
history and part of making

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.233
things right.

00:22:03.233 --> 00:22:05.567
LAURA CHA: Yes.

00:22:05.567 --> 00:22:07.367
I think, absolutely.

00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:11.733
When I became a regulator, I
thought it was just going to

00:22:11.733 --> 00:22:13.067
be two, three years.

00:22:13.067 --> 00:22:17.767
I was going to broaden my
horizon, and it would help my

00:22:17.767 --> 00:22:21.500
career in the law, and then
just one thing led to the

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:25.067
other, and I found that
it was extremely --

00:22:25.067 --> 00:22:26.000
how should I say?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.300
It was very gratifying for me
to be in a position, where I

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.267
feel that I was really
participating in the

00:22:33.267 --> 00:22:36.933
development of a market.

00:22:36.933 --> 00:22:41.100
I'm sure, colleagues in the SEC
and CFTC feel the same way

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.367
in a different manner, because
obviously the U.S. market is

00:22:44.367 --> 00:22:45.333
at a different stage.

00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:48.967
And even among the regulators,
there are the people, who are

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:52.833
in enforcement, where they try
to catch the bad guys, the

00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:56.100
insider dealing cases that
we see nowadays.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.300
Those on the enforcement --

00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:01.033
and of course the Department
of Justice, the Attorney

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:02.300
General's Office --

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:08.267
those people also feel that
there is a mission.

00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:12.000
I think that's also a very
important aspect of a

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.367
financial market.

00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:17.000
I just don't want young people
nowadays to think of financial

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.467
services as purely in
the private sector.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.800
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Another of our outside

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.900
speakers in this course this
semester was Hank Greenberg,

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:36.500
who actually succeeded C.V.
Starr as the founder of what

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:39.800
was then the world's biggest
insurance company AIG.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:45.200
And one of the things that he
told us was, how did AIG get

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.567
so successful?

00:23:46.567 --> 00:23:52.000
Part of it was, because it
embraced the emerging world,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.667
even when it wasn't
popular to do so.

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:55.800
AIG was founded in --

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.333
I think it was Beijing
or Shanghai

00:23:57.333 --> 00:24:01.067
maybe, a long time ago.

00:24:01.067 --> 00:24:05.700
And I thought that maybe he
and you have a similar --

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:11.000
it seems like the emerging world
is obviously more and

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.100
more a part of our economy
and will continue to be.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.200
And that business being
connected --

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.033
we are getting more and more

00:24:22.033 --> 00:24:24.500
international, as you were saying.

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.100
It kind of makes for
a different life.

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.000
One thing that AIG --

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.967
and Hank Greenberg emphasized
to us is, that he has a life

00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:33.800
of diplomacy in some sense.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:40.267
He became a diplomat, or like
an ambassador from the

00:24:40.267 --> 00:24:43.400
business community, because to
work with all these different

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.500
countries requires a certain
sense of mission and purpose

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.533
and skills.

00:24:50.533 --> 00:24:55.767
And I don't know if this is a
well-framed question, but it

00:24:55.767 --> 00:24:59.133
seems like what you were saying
implies an interesting

00:24:59.133 --> 00:25:05.067
career in the emerging world and
a career that involves a

00:25:05.067 --> 00:25:09.533
broad scope of skills, not just
narrow finance skills.

00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:11.733
Does that prompt you?

00:25:11.733 --> 00:25:13.000
LAURA CHA: Yes.

00:25:14.833 --> 00:25:17.800
I very much agree with Hank
Greenberg's view.

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:23.067
I think, when you work in an
emerging market or you work in

00:25:23.067 --> 00:25:27.300
emerging markets, you develop
a different set of skills.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:32.500
And I think, in today's
globalized world there are

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:37.700
more and more multicultural,
global professionals.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.033
I think, we're talking about
20, 30 years ago, U.S.

00:25:42.033 --> 00:25:46.100
expatriates, for that matter,
any other expatriates from the

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.867
U.K., for example, would go out
to the emerging market.

00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:54.400
And people kind of use it as a
stint, you work for five, six

00:25:54.400 --> 00:26:00.600
years, and you go back to your
homeland, and your roots will

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.467
be in your homeland.

00:26:02.467 --> 00:26:04.467
Which is perfectly fine.

00:26:04.467 --> 00:26:06.433
And that's what most
people do.

00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:10.267
But I think in the last decade,
I have seen and I have

00:26:10.267 --> 00:26:12.900
come across more and more young
professionals who --

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.600
because of the education and
because of the background what

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.733
I would call global
professionals.

00:26:23.733 --> 00:26:28.100
They're multicultural, many of
them are multilingual, and

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.833
they will move job to job
in the overseas market.

00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:38.733
And people look upon it
as life's adventure.

00:26:38.733 --> 00:26:42.267
You live in a country for five,
six years, and then you

00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:45.367
move on, and the skills that
you acquire along the way

00:26:45.367 --> 00:26:47.967
really enrich yourself.

00:26:47.967 --> 00:26:51.567
Enrich oneself, and eventually,
if you do go back

00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:55.033
or not go back to your homeland,
it is some skill

00:26:55.033 --> 00:26:58.300
that will stay with you and
change your perspective.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.033
And I think that kind of skill
is becoming increasingly

00:27:02.033 --> 00:27:06.033
important, when we have more
and more cross-border

00:27:06.033 --> 00:27:09.867
transactions, and globalized
markets, where, when something

00:27:09.867 --> 00:27:13.233
happens in one market,
it has an effect

00:27:13.233 --> 00:27:14.600
way beyond the borders.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.800
And that's what we're seeing
more and more nowadays.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.733
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
I was going to ask

00:27:21.733 --> 00:27:23.300
the class for questions.

00:27:30.167 --> 00:27:32.200
While you're thinking for a
moment, let me ask one more

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.100
question of you.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:34.567
LAURA CHA: Sure.

00:27:34.567 --> 00:27:38.433
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: I
just wondered about HSBC,

00:27:38.433 --> 00:27:45.067
which is of another bank, like
AIG, it originated in Hong

00:27:45.067 --> 00:27:51.167
Kong and Shanghai, but it has
become such a world force.

00:27:51.167 --> 00:27:54.000
And I kind of wondered,
when did that happen,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.100
how did that happen?

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.900
Can you give us a nutshell,
because it doesn't happen to

00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.667
every Asian bank.

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:07.400
LAURA CHA: HSBC started in Hong
Kong in 1865, and within

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.300
a few months the Shanghai
branch was

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.333
set up the same year.

00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:18.667
So, we've been here
160 years or so.

00:28:18.667 --> 00:28:21.733
Originally it was trading --

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:23.533
dealing with trade finance
and so on.

00:28:23.533 --> 00:28:25.600
And it became the largest
bank in Hong

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.867
Kong over many decades.

00:28:27.867 --> 00:28:33.600
And the international push
really started in the early

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:41.933
'90s, when HSBC started
acquiring different banks.

00:28:41.933 --> 00:28:46.833
It acquired the Marine Midland
Bank in the U.S., and it

00:28:46.833 --> 00:28:52.333
acquired the Midland Bank in the
U.K. And from a bank, from

00:28:52.333 --> 00:28:56.600
a financial institution, which
was largely local in Hong Kong

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:04.100
with businesses in Asia, it
became an international

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:07.767
organization by acquisition.

00:29:07.767 --> 00:29:12.900
So, the head office moved from
Hong Kong to London, I think,

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:19.033
around '92, '93, when HSBC
acquired the Midland Bank in

00:29:19.033 --> 00:29:24.167
the U.K., and the Bank of
England required the HSBC to

00:29:24.167 --> 00:29:28.000
have the domicile in London
to be regulated

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.167
by the Bank of England.

00:29:30.167 --> 00:29:35.533
Since the '90s, the HSBC had
acquired one of the largest

00:29:35.533 --> 00:29:41.733
banks in France called CCF, it's
now called HSBC France.

00:29:41.733 --> 00:29:47.433
It has acquired Bank of Bermuda
in Bermuda, and it has

00:29:47.433 --> 00:29:48.800
made a lot of acquisitions.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.233
Of course, the most famous, or
infamous, acquisition in the

00:29:52.233 --> 00:29:57.667
U.S. was Household Finance
about 10 years -- less

00:29:57.667 --> 00:29:59.167
than 10 years ago.

00:29:59.167 --> 00:30:02.800
So, HSBC became an international
financial

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.567
institution really in
the last, I would

00:30:05.567 --> 00:30:08.067
say, 15 to 20 years.

00:30:08.067 --> 00:30:18.367
Now, today, 1/3 of our profit
comes from Hong Kong, 1/3

00:30:18.367 --> 00:30:23.367
comes from the rest of Asia,
25% or so from the U.K. and

00:30:23.367 --> 00:30:28.667
Europe, the U.S. is
about 6% and Latin

00:30:28.667 --> 00:30:31.367
America is about 9% roughly.

00:30:31.367 --> 00:30:39.133
So, Asia is a hugely important
market for HSBC, and the

00:30:39.133 --> 00:30:42.200
acronym is Hong Kong and
Shanghai Banking Corporation,

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:48.000
which was the original name when
we were set up in 1865.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.467
So, we do not have a controlling
shareholder, we

00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:55.833
are truly diversified in
our shareholder base.

00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:59.067
A larger shareholder holds
no more than 3% to 4%.

00:30:59.067 --> 00:31:02.200
It is an institutional investor,
so they represent

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.300
many smaller investors.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:07.633
So, it is really run by the
management, professional

00:31:07.633 --> 00:31:10.800
management, and it has done a,
I would have to say, a very

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.133
good job in the last
two decades.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.633
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
OK, any other --

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.267
STUDENT: Hi, thank
you for coming.

00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:32.633
I was just curious, a lot of
people have mentioned that the

00:31:32.633 --> 00:31:36.333
lack of regulation and
enforcement of contracts is a

00:31:36.333 --> 00:31:38.100
main barrier to foreign
investment

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.067
in Asian bond markets.

00:31:40.067 --> 00:31:43.467
How do you think China will
address this, and what are the

00:31:43.467 --> 00:31:46.400
primary differences in the
regulation between China and

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.467
the United States?

00:31:49.467 --> 00:31:52.867
LAURA CHA: Can you say
your question again?

00:31:52.867 --> 00:31:54.067
I didn't catch it.

00:31:54.067 --> 00:31:57.900
I only heard regulation,
can you tell me

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.500
your question again?

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.300
STUDENT: Yes.

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.900
Many people have mentioned that
the lack of regulation

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:07.800
and enforcement of contracts is
a main barrier to foreign

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.400
investment in Asian
bond markets.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.400
How do you think China
will address this?

00:32:16.067 --> 00:32:19.733
LAURA CHA: How do
I think what?

00:32:19.733 --> 00:32:23.167
STUDENT: How will China
address this issue?

00:32:23.167 --> 00:32:25.467
The lack of regulation.

00:32:25.467 --> 00:32:30.467
LAURA CHA: Right, I think China
does not have a lack of

00:32:30.467 --> 00:32:32.433
regulation.

00:32:32.433 --> 00:32:34.767
There are lots of regulations
in China.

00:32:34.767 --> 00:32:37.333
What I would say is, that
there has to be better

00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:41.733
application and enforcement of
regulations, rather than

00:32:41.733 --> 00:32:45.833
periodic and not consistent
regulation.

00:32:45.833 --> 00:32:48.867
I think one of the most
important things for the

00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:52.233
market in terms of regulation
is, that they have to be

00:32:52.233 --> 00:32:56.267
clear, they have to be
consistently applied, and they

00:32:56.267 --> 00:32:58.467
have to be fair.

00:32:58.467 --> 00:33:04.067
It is not a lack of regulation
that is the major problem.

00:33:04.067 --> 00:33:09.867
I think, as in many emerging
markets, China is still trying

00:33:09.867 --> 00:33:14.300
to cope with the issue of
stringent enforcement.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.767
And I think, the regulators in
China recognize that there's a

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:22.133
lot that they need to do
better in terms of

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.933
enforcement.

00:33:23.933 --> 00:33:27.400
And the problem that I see
in China is, that it is

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.533
developing so fast, the market
is way ahead, developing

00:33:32.533 --> 00:33:38.433
faster and quicker and bigger
than the government and the

00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:39.967
regulators have anticipated.

00:33:39.967 --> 00:33:44.967
If we put ourselves back in
the U.S in, let's say the

00:33:44.967 --> 00:33:48.533
crash of the late '20s, and
when the SEC was set up in

00:33:48.533 --> 00:33:54.733
1934, I would say, China is
probably slightly better than

00:33:54.733 --> 00:33:56.900
the U.S. in those days.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.067
But if we compare with the
development of the U.S. market

00:34:01.067 --> 00:34:05.533
in the last five decades or so,
of course, the U.S. has

00:34:05.533 --> 00:34:09.700
developed a lot more, and China
does not have the luxury

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:12.700
to wait 50 years for
its rules and

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.967
enforcement culture to develop.

00:34:14.967 --> 00:34:16.967
And it is catching up.

00:34:16.967 --> 00:34:20.067
Whether the lack of regulation
is therefore an impediment to

00:34:20.067 --> 00:34:23.600
foreign investment, I think
you'll have to look at it from

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.433
several angles.

00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:31.000
China to date is the largest
recipient of foreign direct

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.100
investments, so, in a way, if
the conditions in China are so

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.533
bad, it would not have attracted
so much foreign

00:34:38.533 --> 00:34:39.867
direct investment.

00:34:39.867 --> 00:34:44.033
I'm not saying that the
environment in China is really

00:34:44.033 --> 00:34:47.167
top notch, compared with the
developed markets, but there

00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:50.367
are probably enough
opportunities, and people do

00:34:50.367 --> 00:34:54.167
make enough money, so that it
is by statistics the largest

00:34:54.167 --> 00:34:56.200
recipient of foreign
direct investment.

00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:03.000
And that is a fact compiled
by international agencies.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
So, I don't think that it has
been an impediment, it is an

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.600
impediment when we talk about
individual cases, it is far

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.867
from satisfactory.

00:35:14.267 --> 00:35:15.400
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Can I just

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.367
interject a question there?

00:35:17.367 --> 00:35:20.733
Some people say that the SEC in
the United States could use

00:35:20.733 --> 00:35:23.500
much more resources.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.500
Does China give enough resources
to enforcement?

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.167
It seems to me that there is a
problem in emerging countries,

00:35:31.167 --> 00:35:34.133
or everywhere, that
it's expensive.

00:35:34.133 --> 00:35:37.700
And the country has a budget,
right, which is still

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:38.867
attracted to other things.

00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:44.067
So, do you think that China
devotes enough resources to

00:35:44.067 --> 00:35:45.600
enforcement?

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.300
LAURA CHA: I think that every
regulator would tell you, that

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.200
they need more resources
as far as

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.267
enforcement is concerned.

00:35:53.267 --> 00:35:57.600
I think China could certainly
do with more.

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:04.067
I think one aspect is that you
have to have enough people to

00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:05.733
carry out enforcement.

00:36:05.733 --> 00:36:09.000
And it is trying to catch up.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.900
And, as I said, because the
market is developing so fast,

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.800
that the regulators are always
trying to play catch up, and

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.200
that is not ideal.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.467
I think the SEC could do with
more resources, I would

00:36:23.467 --> 00:36:25.533
absolutely agree with that.

00:36:25.533 --> 00:36:31.500
Any regulators you go to, they
always felt that the

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:33.133
under-resourced aspect
is the enforcement.

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.033
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Other questions?

00:36:40.033 --> 00:36:41.300
Right here.

00:36:43.133 --> 00:36:45.800
STUDENT: I was wondering, if you
think that there are any

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.800
impediments to development in
the Chinese or Hong Kong

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.700
markets based on the government
of China.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.000
You mentioned earlier that
there was a communist

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.400
tradition, and that a lot of the
businesses that you worked

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.267
with were state-oriented
or state-owned.

00:37:01.267 --> 00:37:02.967
So, I was wondering, if you
think that that will have to

00:37:02.967 --> 00:37:07.100
change in the future, or if the
market will change or in

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.033
some way adapt to allow
those to continue to

00:37:10.033 --> 00:37:12.933
operate as they do now?

00:37:12.933 --> 00:37:17.000
LAURA CHA: Do you mean the
state-owned enterprises?

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.300
When you say impediment,
what you mean by that?

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:26.033
STUDENT: You mentioned that
there was a tradition of

00:37:26.033 --> 00:37:30.000
communism and state-owned
enterprises, that a lot of the

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.633
businesses were a little bit
weary of a capitalist system,

00:37:33.633 --> 00:37:36.667
and that you played a pivotal
role in introducing that idea

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:38.200
and really implementing it.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:42.667
Do you think that type of
change will continue?

00:37:42.667 --> 00:37:43.967
LAURA CHA: Very much so.

00:37:43.967 --> 00:37:48.333
I think capitalism has taken
deep root in China already.

00:37:48.333 --> 00:37:51.400
If you go to China nowadays,
the state-owned enterprises

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.800
very much operate as any
other enterprises.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:59.033
The difference is that the
controlling shareholder is the

00:37:59.033 --> 00:38:04.033
state, is some sort of
government entity.

00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:07.700
But it operates, if you look
at some of the larger

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:14.333
state-owned enterprises, like
China Mobile, Petrol China,

00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:16.067
China Telecom --

00:38:16.067 --> 00:38:17.933
they are still state-owned
enterprises, no question,

00:38:17.933 --> 00:38:20.200
because their majority
shareholder, their controlling

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.933
shareholder, is the state,
but they operate in

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.767
a commercial way.

00:38:24.767 --> 00:38:31.800
Of course, some people would
say that there are policy

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.967
preferences, advantages, to
being state-owned enterprises.

00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:38.633
But I think, by and large, now
the state-owned enterprises,

00:38:38.633 --> 00:38:41.967
particularly those that are
listed on the exchange and

00:38:41.967 --> 00:38:45.533
some of those are listed in the
U.S. market as well, they

00:38:45.533 --> 00:38:49.033
do have to operate in a
completely commercial manner.

00:38:49.033 --> 00:38:50.733
They have shareholders
to answer to

00:38:50.733 --> 00:38:51.700
other than the state.

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.600
They have minority shareholders,
who are public

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.200
shareholders, and I think that's
where the discipline

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.767
comes in, the market discipline
comes in.

00:38:58.767 --> 00:39:04.033
So, when you say, whether any
change will take place, change

00:39:04.033 --> 00:39:06.900
has already taken place and will
continue to take place.

00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:11.567
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
Is there another --

00:39:14.033 --> 00:39:15.533
Let me just add something.

00:39:15.533 --> 00:39:19.400
It occurs to me that, at least
in the U.S., there has been a

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:24.433
policy going back to the 1930s
of trying to encourage little,

00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:25.833
start-up companies.

00:39:25.833 --> 00:39:28.533
We created the Small Business
Administration, which

00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:32.967
subsidizes -- the idea has been
that big things grow out

00:39:32.967 --> 00:39:34.767
of small beginnings.

00:39:34.767 --> 00:39:38.767
I wonder if you could
comment on China.

00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:46.367
Does China support young
start-ups adequately?

00:39:46.367 --> 00:39:48.133
LAURA CHA: It does.

00:39:48.133 --> 00:39:51.100
It has been now two years, since
the Growth Enterprise

00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:54.867
Board has been set up in the
Shenzhen Stock Exchange, what

00:39:54.867 --> 00:40:03.100
we call the ''gem board.'' And
it has lower listing criteria,

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:08.200
and that is more or less a
''buyers beware'' market.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:11.867
I mean, it is like any other
''buyers beware'' market, it's

00:40:11.867 --> 00:40:19.100
fraught with a number of high
profile, high PE companies,

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:24.033
which may or may not develop
into something more concrete.

00:40:24.033 --> 00:40:29.133
But I think the idea is to use
the capital market to nurture

00:40:29.133 --> 00:40:32.700
the small business, that's the
growth enterprise market.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.500
Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which
is across the border from Hong

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.133
Kong, also has a --

00:40:38.133 --> 00:40:42.167
part of it's board is called
Small-Medium Enterprise Board.

00:40:42.167 --> 00:40:45.167
So, if you are not a growth
company but you are a small-

00:40:45.167 --> 00:40:47.700
or medium-sized company,
then you are listed

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.000
on this other board.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.900
So, there are two specific
boards addressing exactly the

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.567
question you raised, namely to
nurture the smaller companies.

00:41:12.967 --> 00:41:17.400
STUDENT: Hi, could you give a
couple of examples, maybe, of

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.100
the skills you learned in the
public sector that helped you,

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:26.900
now working at HSBC, or maybe a
situation, where, because of

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.700
what you learned in the public
sector, you had a better

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.300
decision making?

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.833
LAURA CHA: That's
a good question.

00:41:34.833 --> 00:41:41.667
I think, what I took away most
from my years as a regulator

00:41:41.667 --> 00:41:47.600
is really to look at an issue
from the macro level.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.467
I think in the private sector,
when you are given a problem,

00:41:51.467 --> 00:41:55.133
when you are, let's say, in a
private firm, in a bank, or a

00:41:55.133 --> 00:42:00.600
law firm, or any professional
firm, you're given a set of

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:04.933
problems, perhaps a client has
a certain problem, and your

00:42:04.933 --> 00:42:07.500
role is to help solve
that problem.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:13.067
And within the contacts of that
client alone, and in the

00:42:13.067 --> 00:42:14.800
confined of that problem.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:21.400
And most of the time, you help
the client to overcome some

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.567
either legal issues or other
commercial issues, so that the

00:42:25.567 --> 00:42:28.300
client can get to where
he wants to go.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:33.067
Whether it's acquisition or
merger or disposal, et cetera.

00:42:33.067 --> 00:42:37.267
In the public sector as a
regulator, how you learn to

00:42:37.267 --> 00:42:41.700
look at the issue that is
presented to you from a more

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:46.500
macro level in the sense that,
how does this particular issue

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.933
impact on the market
as a whole?

00:42:49.933 --> 00:42:58.100
I'll give you an example: A
group of companies in Hong

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.867
Kong came to the regulator in
Hong Kong and asked for

00:43:01.867 --> 00:43:03.667
certain exemptions.

00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:08.767
The reasons that they put
forward are quite cogent and

00:43:08.767 --> 00:43:11.767
not unreasonable from the
client's point of view, from

00:43:11.767 --> 00:43:14.300
the company's point of view.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:18.633
Now, if I were in my role as a
lawyer, I would fight very

00:43:18.633 --> 00:43:22.167
hard for the client to get
that exemption, but as a

00:43:22.167 --> 00:43:24.900
regulator I have to look
at what does this --

00:43:27.633 --> 00:43:30.800
if I give the exemption
what kind of knock-on

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.733
effect will it have?

00:43:31.733 --> 00:43:34.467
Will it set a precedent?

00:43:34.467 --> 00:43:36.067
And is it a good precedent?

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:38.300
Or is it not a good precedent?

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:42.100
If it is a good precedent, then
it should not be just

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:44.267
given to this one particular
company.

00:43:44.267 --> 00:43:48.533
Then, perhaps rules should be
amended in such a way, that

00:43:48.533 --> 00:43:51.800
what this client, what this
particular group of company

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.900
wants, should be given
to everyone who wants

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:59.300
to apply for it.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:02.767
But if it is not, and if it is
just purely for the benefit of

00:44:02.767 --> 00:44:06.533
this one particular group of
company, then you really

00:44:06.533 --> 00:44:10.367
should not give in to
that exemption.

00:44:10.367 --> 00:44:13.833
And you have to recognize
that there are different

00:44:13.833 --> 00:44:17.267
considerations, such as the size
of the group, the impact

00:44:17.267 --> 00:44:21.233
that it may have on the
market, et cetera.

00:44:21.233 --> 00:44:24.767
So, the skills that one learns
as a regulator is really to

00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:29.000
look at the problem presented
you from a more --

00:44:32.967 --> 00:44:39.067
at a higher level, you look at
the entire scenario and how

00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:42.067
this piece would fit into a
bigger picture, whereas in the

00:44:42.067 --> 00:44:44.000
private sector you
don't need to.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.167
And how it's helpful to me now,
in my current position,

00:44:48.167 --> 00:44:55.200
is that I am able, I think,
to interpret policy and to

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.467
anticipate policy, because I
could see that certain things

00:44:59.467 --> 00:45:04.367
are happening a certain way that
those are the issues that

00:45:04.367 --> 00:45:06.967
the regulators are likely
to address.

00:45:06.967 --> 00:45:09.833
And therefore, from the private
sector we should be

00:45:09.833 --> 00:45:13.833
prepared for the changes
that will take place.

00:45:13.833 --> 00:45:15.400
So, that's in a very
abstract way.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.067
I can't quote you exact examples
for obvious reasons,

00:45:19.067 --> 00:45:21.100
but that is --

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:25.900
In a nutshell, I certainly find
it helped me as a person

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:33.833
to look at matters from a
broader point of view.

00:45:43.067 --> 00:45:44.600
STUDENT: Hi, thank you.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.400
You spoke about the

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.967
demutualization of stock exchanges.

00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:52.000
And one of the outcomes you're
seeing of that is the mergers

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.467
and acquisitions of stock
exchanges themselves.

00:45:54.467 --> 00:45:57.067
And I think, in the last one
year itself we've seen a whole

00:45:57.067 --> 00:45:59.300
bunch of very interesting
deals, Singapore and

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.067
Australia, New York and Deutsche
Boerse, et cetera.

00:46:02.067 --> 00:46:04.667
And one of the one's that really
caught my attention was

00:46:04.667 --> 00:46:07.467
the Shanghai-Brazil link-up.

00:46:07.467 --> 00:46:10.600
So, perhaps I want to hear your
views on, do you think

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:15.467
this wave of tie-ups is going
to carry on, and if so, what

00:46:15.467 --> 00:46:19.000
form do you think it will take
in the coming years?

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.100
LAURA CHA: I think in that last
decade, the exchanges

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:28.233
around the world have
really taken on --

00:46:28.233 --> 00:46:32.633
or more than a decade
now, the landscape

00:46:32.633 --> 00:46:33.933
has completely changed.

00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:37.033
It used to be, an exchange
is kind of

00:46:37.033 --> 00:46:39.133
like a national symbol.

00:46:39.133 --> 00:46:43.400
Each nation has it's own
exchange, and that is almost

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.700
like a national --

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.433
how should I say?

00:46:46.433 --> 00:46:50.100
It's a utility that cannot
be taken over

00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.000
by a foreign country.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.500
We saw that went by the wayside,
when the New York

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:05.167
Stock Exchange acquired
Euronext, and of course NASDAQ

00:47:05.167 --> 00:47:09.000
have alliances, and just
different ways.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.700
And now we're into a second
phase, where these already

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:17.100
consolidated and aligned
exchanges are forming even

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:20.067
more consolidation.

00:47:20.067 --> 00:47:22.000
That may or may not happen,
there's a lot

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.267
of talk about it.

00:47:23.267 --> 00:47:32.000
And I think, what drives this
latest wave of exchange

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.733
acquisitions and alliances are
really the easy end, the

00:47:37.733 --> 00:47:42.400
electronic networks, that are
driving the cost of trading

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.433
down, that leave the larger
exchanges like the NYSE --

00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:51.300
a lot of the volume has gone
to the easy end, and they

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:56.033
really have to align with others
to get the business up.

00:47:56.033 --> 00:47:58.833
The other is products.

00:47:58.833 --> 00:48:05.200
I think the merger of exchanges
will only make sense

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:10.300
when there are mutually
complimentary products.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.467
And geography also
makes sense.

00:48:13.467 --> 00:48:16.467
And how will I see
the outcome?

00:48:16.467 --> 00:48:24.367
I think, many markets still look
upon their exchange as a

00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:27.133
national symbol and they do not
necessarily want -- it's

00:48:27.133 --> 00:48:31.200
more a matter of the local
politicians' sentiment, rather

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.867
than looking at the commercial
side and looking at the

00:48:33.867 --> 00:48:35.500
political side.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.400
Someone once told me about this
Singapore and Australian

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.800
stock exchange --

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.933
the pending merger that
has been announced --

00:48:43.933 --> 00:48:46.100
I don't have the latest, I don't
know whether it's going

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:47.533
to go through.

00:48:47.533 --> 00:48:51.400
Somebody in Australia told me,
well, it is almost like Qantas

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.400
being taken over by Singapore
Airlines.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.667
In the commercial world, well,
if that makes sense, why not?

00:48:59.667 --> 00:49:03.300
But I think, there is still a
lot of sentiment that a stock

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:06.000
exchange is something
very national.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.200
So, I don't know how that will
play out, because all these

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.400
mergers are subject to the
votes of the local

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.667
politicians.

00:49:13.667 --> 00:49:16.667
And so, they may have different
considerations than

00:49:16.667 --> 00:49:18.400
just purely the commercial
side.

00:49:23.333 --> 00:49:24.600
STUDENT: Hello.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.700
Hi.

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.133
Thank you for your time.

00:49:28.133 --> 00:49:31.233
I have sort of a two-part
question.

00:49:31.233 --> 00:49:36.200
The first part, in regards to
all these Chinese companies

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:42.167
that are registered overseas,
that sort of complicates the

00:49:42.167 --> 00:49:44.800
regulations, so I was wondering,
if you could talk

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.733
about Chinese companies being
registered overseas and being

00:49:49.733 --> 00:49:52.733
listed in overseas exchanges.

00:49:52.733 --> 00:49:57.367
And the second part, the
question is, I've heard, at

00:49:57.367 --> 00:50:00.333
least I've read that there's a
new international board that's

00:50:00.333 --> 00:50:02.833
being set up in China to
encourage these companies to

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.833
come back to mainland
China or Hong Kong.

00:50:04.833 --> 00:50:10.167
So, I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about

00:50:10.167 --> 00:50:13.967
how it's going to be shaped,
some of it's challenges, and

00:50:13.967 --> 00:50:16.100
what do you think would be most
important for success?

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.533
LAURA CHA: OK.

00:50:17.533 --> 00:50:19.867
The first part of your question,
Chinese companies

00:50:19.867 --> 00:50:23.600
that are registered overseas
and listed overseas.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.900
There is no rule that forbids
Chinese companies to be

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.000
registered anywhere.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.133
I think, let's say a company
in China, they can elect to

00:50:34.133 --> 00:50:37.767
register themselves in Hong
Kong, in Bermuda, Cayman

00:50:37.767 --> 00:50:41.267
Islands, wherever,
U.S., Delaware.

00:50:41.267 --> 00:50:46.100
And the matter of listing is
really up to the issuer

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:49.800
itself, if they decided that a
listing in the U.S., whether

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.833
it's NASDAQ or the NYSE, makes
sense, that's where they would

00:50:52.833 --> 00:50:56.567
list. And once they are listed,
they are subject to

00:50:56.567 --> 00:50:59.900
the rules and regulations of
the SEC just like anybody

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.633
else, just like any of the
other foreign companies.

00:51:03.633 --> 00:51:09.833
So, I think the place of listing
really determines the

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:12.567
kind of rules that would be
applied to that company.

00:51:12.567 --> 00:51:16.200
Once a company is listed, let's
say on the New York

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:18.600
Stock Exchange, then the U.S.
rules will come in, and

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:24.100
whether it is a Chinese company
is kind of irrelevant.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.367
It will have to be complying
with the U.S. rules just like

00:51:27.367 --> 00:51:29.200
everybody else.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.133
So, that's the first part of
your question, I don't know

00:51:31.133 --> 00:51:35.133
whether that answers it.

00:51:35.133 --> 00:51:36.800
The second part of your
question, about the

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.233
international board
in Shanghai.

00:51:39.233 --> 00:51:43.033
Yes, there has been a lot of
talk about the Shanghai Stock

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:46.567
Exchange setting up an
international board.

00:51:46.567 --> 00:51:52.000
Meaning a board, where companies
registered outside

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.233
of China such as the red chips,
which are not listed in

00:51:55.233 --> 00:51:59.000
China, would return to the
Shanghai Stock Exchange.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.200
Because they are not registered
in China, they are

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.200
therefore not a Chinese company,
they are therefore

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.233
kind of like a foreign
company, because they

00:52:06.233 --> 00:52:10.367
registered in Hong Kong or
Bermuda or wherever.

00:52:10.367 --> 00:52:14.000
The idea of the international
board is to attract not only

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.133
these types of Chinese companies
that have been

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:19.800
registered outside, but for
companies, that are

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:25.400
multinationals, that are already
listed in the outside

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.333
market, to be inside China.

00:52:28.333 --> 00:52:36.800
And the major reason that I can
discern is, one, to give

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:41.400
the Chinese investor a wider
variety of products.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:46.300
Because the renminbi is still
a non-convertible currency,

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:50.867
the vast majority of Chinese
investors can only invest in

00:52:50.867 --> 00:52:54.267
the domestic market, only in the
Chinese companies that are

00:52:54.267 --> 00:52:57.433
listed there.

00:52:57.433 --> 00:53:01.733
They cannot easily invest in,
let's say Microsoft, HSBC,

00:53:01.733 --> 00:53:05.733
IBM, General Motors,
et cetera.

00:53:05.733 --> 00:53:08.400
So, I think the Chinese
government has thought, well,

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:13.133
maybe we can bring some of the
companies to China, for these

00:53:13.133 --> 00:53:17.500
companies to raise capital and
issue shares in China, so that

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.700
the Chinese investors will
be able to asses it.

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:27.367
The second part is really to
raise the profile and the

00:53:27.367 --> 00:53:31.600
standard of the Shanghai
Stock Exchange.

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.900
The Shanghai Stock Exchange
has ambition to be an

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.333
international financial
center.

00:53:38.233 --> 00:53:41.467
Domestic documents have said
that they should be developed

00:53:41.467 --> 00:53:43.033
into an international financial

00:53:43.033 --> 00:53:45.733
center by the year 2020.

00:53:45.733 --> 00:53:49.567
And one of roots of reaching
that goal is to have an

00:53:49.567 --> 00:53:53.333
international board for
international companies, and

00:53:53.333 --> 00:53:56.800
that is, what, I think, the
Shanghai government and the

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.700
Shanghai Stock Exchange
are setting out to do.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:05.233
But to date, the rules have
not yet been promulgated.

00:54:05.233 --> 00:54:07.867
We don't know when it will.

00:54:07.867 --> 00:54:11.500
I was a delegate to the National
People's Congress,

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.533
and we met in March
[addition: 2011],

00:54:14.533 --> 00:54:17.500
earlier this month, and there's
no discussion or

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.800
timetable that has been set.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:21.633
Many people think, it would
be a good thing.

00:54:21.633 --> 00:54:25.633
Some people inside China think
that it will not be such a

00:54:25.633 --> 00:54:30.533
good thing, because it will
divert the savings to foreign

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:33.300
companies, but I think most
people think that it will be a

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.833
good thing for China.

00:54:35.833 --> 00:54:38.867
So, I don't know whether that
answers your question.

00:54:38.867 --> 00:54:41.300
Do you have a second part
to the second question?

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:44.200
I might have missed it.

00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.133
STUDENT: No, I think that really
answered my question.

00:54:46.133 --> 00:54:48.833
But the first part, actually
the reason why I asked the

00:54:48.833 --> 00:54:53.700
first part of the questions
was, because a lot of the

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.933
recent frauds that came up
happened or were discovered,

00:54:57.933 --> 00:55:00.000
because a lot of Chinese
companies registering with the

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.433
New York Stock Exchange had a
filing with the SEC, whereas

00:55:04.433 --> 00:55:07.800
they also have a filing for
their own government, the

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.200
Chinese government.

00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.267
And then these filings for their
annual reports, their

00:55:12.267 --> 00:55:14.400
numbers, would not match.

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.233
And I just thought, there
would be some kind of

00:55:17.233 --> 00:55:21.667
complications in terms of
regulation, when the

00:55:21.667 --> 00:55:24.667
government's regulating
these companies.

00:55:24.667 --> 00:55:30.033
LAURA CHA: I think that,
whenever a company is listed

00:55:30.033 --> 00:55:34.933
on a foreign market, it is
subject to the full rules and

00:55:34.933 --> 00:55:38.567
regulations of that market.

00:55:38.567 --> 00:55:40.500
There is no if's and but's.

00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:45.400
I think, the U.S. authority
would take action against any

00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:47.800
fraud or misstatement.

00:55:57.467 --> 00:55:58.733
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
OK, right here.

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:07.000
STUDENT: What type of law did
you study, and how difficult

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.033
did you find the transition from
the legal world to the

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:12.800
business world?

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:19.700
LAURA CHA: In law school, I
took a lot of courses in

00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:24.467
corporate law, tax,
corporate finance.

00:56:24.467 --> 00:56:27.933
I think the business world
always interested me and the

00:56:27.933 --> 00:56:30.667
transition from law to --

00:56:30.667 --> 00:56:34.167
I think it was a
two-step thing.

00:56:34.167 --> 00:56:36.933
I was a lawyer, and then I was
a regulator, and then I am

00:56:36.933 --> 00:56:40.400
completely in the private
sector now.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.867
So, the transition from a lawyer
to a regulator wasn't

00:56:42.867 --> 00:56:45.467
that difficult.

00:56:45.467 --> 00:56:49.700
I remember distinctly that,
when I moved over to the

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:53.433
Securities and Futures
Commission, what I wasn't used

00:56:53.433 --> 00:56:56.567
to was, I always wanted to
correct every document that

00:56:56.567 --> 00:56:58.333
came before me, I wanted
to improve it.

00:56:58.333 --> 00:57:00.067
I mean, it was just
the lawyer in me.

00:57:00.067 --> 00:57:04.833
I wanted to make it written
better, clearer, et cetera.

00:57:04.833 --> 00:57:09.333
And then, I had to kind of
restrain myself, because I

00:57:09.333 --> 00:57:15.367
wasn't there to correct and make
a presentable document,

00:57:15.367 --> 00:57:18.233
but to really solve
the problems.

00:57:18.233 --> 00:57:21.867
And then, having been a
regulator and mostly really

00:57:21.867 --> 00:57:25.067
regulating the corporate world,
I became quite familiar

00:57:25.067 --> 00:57:28.300
with the corporate
finance side.

00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.533
And when I was at the securities
and futures

00:57:30.533 --> 00:57:33.667
commission in Hong Kong, I was
the head of the corporate

00:57:33.667 --> 00:57:36.533
finance division for five years,
and during that five

00:57:36.533 --> 00:57:40.833
years I came across all kinds
of corporate transactions.

00:57:40.833 --> 00:57:43.800
Mergers and acquisitions,
takeovers, and of course the

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:52.167
IPOs, so that kind of helped
me in where I am today.

00:57:52.167 --> 00:57:55.433
I wouldn't really call me a
banker per se, because I'm not

00:57:55.433 --> 00:57:59.133
in the operation side, I'm on
the board, and I provide

00:57:59.133 --> 00:58:06.400
advisory service to HSBC, but
I'm not really operating as a

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.300
banker per se.

00:58:08.300 --> 00:58:11.733
So, I would say it wasn't
difficult, it was an

00:58:11.733 --> 00:58:13.267
evolution type of --

00:58:13.267 --> 00:58:15.633
throughout my career from
one thing to the next.

00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:23.967
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:58:23.967 --> 00:58:28.467
STUDENT: Hi, I was wondering,
having worked on the

00:58:28.467 --> 00:58:30.567
regulation side and, now
working for the private

00:58:30.567 --> 00:58:32.800
sector, I think that puts you
in a unique position to

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:35.967
determine what the impact of
internationalization of

00:58:35.967 --> 00:58:38.933
regulation will have on the
financial services sector.

00:58:38.933 --> 00:58:41.900
So more specifically, what do
you think the regulatory

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:44.067
impact of Basel III will be?

00:58:44.067 --> 00:58:46.033
Because a lot of private sector
individuals have come

00:58:46.033 --> 00:58:48.500
out and said that some of the
requirements, in terms of the

00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.067
capital adequacy requirements
and so on,

00:58:50.067 --> 00:58:52.900
have been very harsh.

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:56.300
So, first of all, I guess, how
do you think it'll be phased

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:59.933
in and, second of all, do you
think it's the appropriate

00:58:59.933 --> 00:59:01.200
level of regulation?

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.133
LAURA CHA: Basel III,
I think, it is

00:59:06.133 --> 00:59:08.133
very costly to implement.

00:59:08.133 --> 00:59:14.133
I think, the banks have largely
accepted that more

00:59:14.133 --> 00:59:17.633
stringent regulations will have
to come our way because

00:59:17.633 --> 00:59:21.833
of the financial crisis
of the last two years.

00:59:21.833 --> 00:59:25.700
But not all banks are alike, and
certainly at HSBC we felt

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.633
that we have been thrown in with
the rest of them, whereas

00:59:28.633 --> 00:59:32.667
we had not taken any government
money and we have

00:59:32.667 --> 00:59:35.167
done reasonably well, we have
weathered the crisis

00:59:35.167 --> 00:59:36.400
reasonably well.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:41.767
But having said that, I think
one has to accept that,

00:59:41.767 --> 00:59:45.200
whenever there's a crisis,
regulation will come in more

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.400
stringently, and the pendulum
will tend to

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.867
swing too far one way.

00:59:49.867 --> 00:59:52.300
And then gradually, the pendulum
will come -- in the

00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:56.133
boom market, then the pendulum
will swing back, and then it

00:59:56.133 --> 00:59:58.467
would be too lax, and then
another crisis will happen,

00:59:58.467 --> 00:59:59.767
and then more rules
will come in.

00:59:59.767 --> 01:00:03.133
It has always been like that, if
you look at the history of

01:00:03.133 --> 01:00:07.667
any market, they always
swung to the extreme.

01:00:07.667 --> 01:00:11.933
Sarbanes-Oxley, I think,
is a good example.

01:00:11.933 --> 01:00:14.333
Sarbanes-Oxley came about, I
don't need to tell you, as a

01:00:14.333 --> 01:00:16.600
result of the Enron crisis.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:20.167
And of course the last crisis,
which was the subprime crisis,

01:00:20.167 --> 01:00:21.433
was nothing like Enron.

01:00:23.867 --> 01:00:26.167
When I was a regulator, we
always said, we're always

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:28.967
correcting yesterday's problems.
When a scandal

01:00:28.967 --> 01:00:31.833
happens, when a crisis happens,
we think of rules to

01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:36.467
address what had gone wrong,
but the next time something

01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:38.533
happens it's not going to
happen the same way.

01:00:38.533 --> 01:00:42.267
You are preventing the old
problem from repeating itself,

01:00:42.267 --> 01:00:44.800
but the new problem will
be entirely different.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.267
So, that's just the
way things are.

01:00:49.267 --> 01:00:52.867
And that's the other reason, why
I think some of the young

01:00:52.867 --> 01:00:55.233
and bright students should
not always be

01:00:55.233 --> 01:00:56.100
in the private sector.

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.767
The public sector needs
a balance of that.

01:00:58.767 --> 01:01:02.267
And then, as far as
international regulations are

01:01:02.267 --> 01:01:04.967
concerned, the regulators have
talked for a long time about

01:01:04.967 --> 01:01:06.967
harmonization of standards.

01:01:06.967 --> 01:01:11.333
I don't think it will happen,
because different regulators,

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:16.000
different national regulators,
have their own priorities, and

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.600
they don't always have
the same priorities.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:24.567
And the best example is really
the Financial Stability Board,

01:01:24.567 --> 01:01:28.733
which came out of the last
Asian financial crisis.

01:01:28.733 --> 01:01:32.300
It was called Financial
Stability Forum, it is now a

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:37.233
Financial Stability Board, and
the idea is to ensure that

01:01:37.233 --> 01:01:40.667
there is financial stability
globally, but that

01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:41.967
takes a lot of work.

01:01:41.967 --> 01:01:48.633
I think, the G-20 is trying very
hard, and of course the

01:01:48.633 --> 01:01:52.800
regulatory agencies as well as
all the central bankers are

01:01:52.800 --> 01:02:01.133
now hopefully in a better
cooperative mood, but I think

01:02:01.133 --> 01:02:04.767
to have one set of international
and harmonized

01:02:04.767 --> 01:02:08.333
standards is very hard.

01:02:08.333 --> 01:02:11.200
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: OK,
I think we're out of time.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.667
Laura, I just want
to thank you.

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:17.267
I think this was very good.

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:21.000
Hearing the details of your
career, and hearing all the

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.633
different things you've done in
both the public and private

01:02:23.633 --> 01:02:27.567
sector reminds me of --

01:02:27.567 --> 01:02:31.033
we're going through a period
of development of the world

01:02:31.033 --> 01:02:34.900
and expansion, and somebody has
to get the details right.

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:39.133
And I'm very impressed that you
are one of those people

01:02:39.133 --> 01:02:40.800
who's making things work.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.000
So, I'm glad that you were able
to convey these thoughts

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
to our students here today,
and thank you very much.

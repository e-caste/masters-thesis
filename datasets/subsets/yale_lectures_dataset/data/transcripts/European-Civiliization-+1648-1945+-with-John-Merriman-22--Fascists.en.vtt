00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.990
Prof: I assume you saw
Triumph of the Will.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.281
I think I mentioned the other
day Leni Riefenstahl only died

00:00:08.281 --> 00:00:11.420
about four years ago,
at age 102.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.723
She did interviews,
and just looked back on that

00:00:16.723 --> 00:00:22.477
regime as, she was a
professional and she did a good

00:00:22.477 --> 00:00:23.380
job.
 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.664
Her employers,
in this case Adolf Hitler,

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:27.320
were pleased with her work.
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.230
What's interesting about the
film,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.064
among the many things,
and some of the themes I'll

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.790
touch on and you're reading
about,

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.993
is that it's a combination of
the kind of medieval and the

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:37.780
very modern.
 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.980
Hitler, like Mussolini,
used modern technology.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.180
Germans who could barely afford
to eat had radios,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.969
and listened to speeches of the
Fuhrer, and it was the same

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.190
thing in Italy with Mussolini.
 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.160
While you saw the images of
kind of medieval Nuremburg,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.700
which no longer exists,
medieval Nuremburg,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.274
or not much of it,
and the kind of modern

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:05.579
technology and the whole thing.
 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.349
Hitler liked airplanes.
 

00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:10.242
He liked to fly around,
and for all of the kind of

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:14.516
images of the German warriors,
kind of a medieval person

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:19.569
diving in frozen Pomeranian
ponds and things like that,

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:24.790
the modern is apparent, too.
 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.974
If you want,
the most chilling example of

00:01:27.974 --> 00:01:32.992
the modern would be the assembly
line, the transformation of the

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.780
assembly line into mass murder.
 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.390
The assembly line in the death
camps.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.830
Has anyone here been to
Auschwitz?

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.120
I've been to Auschwitz-Birkenau.
 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.893
I've been to Dachau,
also, a long,

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:50.420
long time ago,
but Auschwitz fairly recently.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.435
One of the most chilling things
about Auschwitz,

00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:58.364
actually, the sheer--it's just
beyond anything,

00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:01.438
but it's the commandant's
house.

00:02:01.438 --> 00:02:04.700
The commandant's house has
little swings out behind it.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.459
That's where the commandant
lived.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.658
His wife said this was the
happiest time of their lives.

00:02:08.658 --> 00:02:12.586
The little children were
playing in the garden on the

00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:17.120
swings, and there's a big wall
there, but not a huge wall.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.192
The crematoriums are on the
other side in that part,

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:22.389
at Auschwitz.
 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.400
Birkenau s a couple kilometers
away.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.288
Life went on in that way as
this sort of assembly line--mass

00:02:31.288 --> 00:02:35.979
murderers of millions and
millions of people.

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:41.230
Hungarian Jews outnumbered
Polish Jews exterminated at

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.610
Auschwitz just barely.
 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.629
That's because at the end of
the war the Hungarians were

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.310
sending these huge trainloads of
people to be exterminated there.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.848
Anyway, I want today to talk
about Adolf Hitler.

00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:59.181
I will bring into this some of
the themes that you're reading

00:02:59.181 --> 00:02:59.758
about.
 

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:02.400
Just two things at the
beginning.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.219
Obviously, National Socialism
was one variant,

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:12.468
certainly the most horrible
variant of fascism.

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:17.258
You can put Franco into that
mix.

00:03:17.258 --> 00:03:24.229
There was rightwing
authoritarian rule everywhere.

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:27.990
Secondly, like World War I,
there's no other period of

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.176
history that has such great
literature, at least in English,

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:33.098
about it.
 

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:39.158
There's a wonderful trilogy by
Richard Evans on Hitler and the

00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:43.431
Nazis to 1933,
and the second volume is 1933

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.710
to the war, September 1,1939.
 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.710
The third is 1939 to the end,
to the bunker.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.539
There are many biographies of
Hitler.

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:56.229
I've read about three of them.
 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.008
But the best by far is Ian
Kershaw's two volumes.

00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:04.223
It's very long,
and I'll be drawing on that in

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:04.879
part.
 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.400
Let's get going on that.
 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:16.199
There's a photo that's not in
the book, but there's a photo of

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.319
Hitler reviewing his guys.
 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:25.117
That particular photo,
which was taken about 1927,

00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:27.720
was on a huge field.
 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.639
You see Hitler reviewing his
guys there.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.584
What people don't realize is
that picture was taken from a

00:04:34.584 --> 00:04:37.836
huge--;there are lots of other
people out there,

00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:40.120
little groups like the Nazis.
 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.459
It might have been a little
earlier.

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:44.470
They, too, have their leader,
their Fuhrer.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.194
Hitler ends up,
the National Socialists end up

00:04:47.194 --> 00:04:49.800
winning, but they weren't the
only group.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.932
I'm not a believer in the
"great person"

00:04:53.932 --> 00:04:55.449
view of history.
 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.440
Hitler did not make the Nazis.
 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.949
World War I created the Nazis.
 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.547
A lot of the racism,
a lot of the idea of hygienics,

00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:08.074
racial purification,
and all of that was out there,

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:11.250
as you know and I've tried to
make clear.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.255
But if it wouldn't have been
Hitler, there would have been

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:13.819
somebody else.
 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.069
In 1933, when Hitler becomes
chancellor,

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:20.120
when the other rights,
there are many rights,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.386
but when Von Papen says,
"We've got them boxed in

00:05:22.386 --> 00:05:22.569
now.
 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:25.810
We can use Hitler for our own
goals."

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.569
How incredibly naÃ¯ve that
was.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:35.879
The Nazis must be seen in the
context of World War I.

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:39.723
They must be seen in the
context of the poisoning of the

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:42.519
political atmosphere between the
wars.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:49.709
In 1876, Alois
Schickelgruber--I didn't write

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:54.918
it on the board;
I sent this stuff around to you

00:05:54.918 --> 00:05:58.576
today, a lot of it,
but Schicklgruber is not on the

00:05:58.576 --> 00:06:01.649
list--changed his name to Alois
Hitler.

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:06.177
It was a peasant family in
lower Australia--lower

00:06:06.177 --> 00:06:07.310
Australia?
 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.399
Lower Austria!--bordering on
Bohemia.

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:11.579
I've been to lower Australia.
 

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:12.800
I've been to lower Austria, too.
 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.740
But anyway, bordering on
Bohemia.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.947
Thus, the family's dislike of
Czechs, and Hitler's particular

00:06:18.947 --> 00:06:20.350
dislike of Czechs.
 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.600
But he disliked everybody
outside of Germans.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.629
His father was
"illegitimate,"

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:29.903
and ended up with the name of
his mother's long-deceased

00:06:29.903 --> 00:06:35.879
wife's father,
Georg Heidler,

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:39.290
which in 1876 became Hitler,
as I said.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.244
There was a rumor even during
the 1920s that Hitler's

00:06:43.244 --> 00:06:47.274
grandfather was Jewish,
and these rumors circulated in

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:49.100
Munich in the 1920s.
 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.601
Hitler was born in
Braunau-am-Inn on the border of

00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:55.889
Germany, that is the
Austrian-German border.

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:01.242
This was important in his
obsession with uniting the two

00:07:01.242 --> 00:07:02.410
countries.
 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.386
His father was a customs
official, comfortable kind of

00:07:07.386 --> 00:07:09.639
lower-class existence.
 

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.930
But it was not a happy family
at all.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:17.351
His father was strict,
pompous, proud of his minimal

00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:22.120
status, extremely pedantic,
and had a violent temper.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.666
He took care of bees with more
loving attention than he took

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:26.930
care of his family.
 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.850
He managed the family with
efficiency, but without love.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.122
Hitler's mother is described by
Ian Kershaw as a simple,

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.043
modest, kindly woman,
who went to church and was

00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:41.339
devoted to her two surviving
children,

00:07:41.339 --> 00:07:43.379
Adolf and Paula.
 

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:47.269
She smothered them with
protectiveness.

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:50.401
Adolf Hitler feared but did not
love his father,

00:07:50.401 --> 00:07:54.333
but this does not explain the
murderous results of the whole

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:55.000
thing.
 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.600
Civil servants get moved
around, customs people.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.302
The family moved to Linz,
L-I-N-Z, in Austria,

00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:05.182
which was a hotbed of
anti-Semitism,

00:08:05.182 --> 00:08:06.170
in 1895.
 

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.709
Hitler began his schooling at
age six.

00:08:08.709 --> 00:08:13.927
He viewed Linz as his hometown,
and, in not a terribly too

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:17.130
happy early life,
looked back almost

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.610
nostalgically upon living in
Linz.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.649
He did not pick up his
anti-Semitism in Linz.

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:28.255
He started secretary schooling
in 1900, but he was

00:08:28.255 --> 00:08:31.790
unsatisfactory in math and in
natural history.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.779
He didn't like his teachers.
 

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:38.306
He was, in principle,
respectful, but he thought

00:08:38.306 --> 00:08:41.100
himself above many of them.
 

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.190
He was badly adjusted.
 

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.259
His father wanted him to be a
civil servant.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:49.313
He wanted him to follow and be
the next in line of the Hitler

00:08:49.313 --> 00:08:50.178
civil servants.
 

00:08:50.178 --> 00:08:53.440
But Adolf, as you know,
resisted.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.330
He wanted to be an artist.
 

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.341
His father said,
"You will not be an artist

00:08:58.341 --> 00:09:00.330
as long as I am living."
 

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:04.398
Linz was--besides being a
hotbed of anti-Semitism,

00:09:04.398 --> 00:09:07.720
it was a hotbed of German
nationalism.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.614
Not just Austrian
German-speaking nationalism,

00:09:10.614 --> 00:09:12.928
but German in general
nationalism.

00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:17.792
His father died in 1903 and
then Hitler hit the academic

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:18.500
skids.
 

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.918
He failed in math.
 

00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:23.827
He moved to another school
fifty-miles-away in a place

00:09:23.827 --> 00:09:26.850
called Steyr,
but it wasn't any better.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.710
Then he took up this sort of
idle existence.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.029
He painted.
 

00:09:33.029 --> 00:09:34.090
He read poetry.
 

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.000
He attended the theater.
 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.139
That was one of his great loves
in Linz, 1905-1907.

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:45.309
He had one friend,
August Kubizek,

00:09:45.309 --> 00:09:48.769
who was the son of an
upholsterer.

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:51.298
Hitler dominated.
 

00:09:51.298 --> 00:09:53.850
He needed somebody to listen to
him.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.744
Kubizek was exposed,
and I suppose willingly,

00:09:58.744 --> 00:10:03.192
to Hitler's diatribes,
his pontification,

00:10:03.192 --> 00:10:08.308
his monologues about virtually
everything.

00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:11.049
He was the classic kind of
know-it-all.

00:10:11.049 --> 00:10:14.850
He was pale, thin.
 

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:19.658
He had that little mustache
that would become bigger.

00:10:19.658 --> 00:10:21.590
He wore a black coat and a dark
hat.

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.250
He carried a black cane with a
pretentious ivory handle.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.024
His great passion was
Wagner--Those of you who know

00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:37.135
about music know that Wagner was
a raving anti-Semite--as well as

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:41.897
art and architecture,
about which he claimed to know

00:10:41.897 --> 00:10:42.960
a great deal.
 

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.109
He wanted to begin his artistic
career at the academy in Vienna,

00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:52.850
and his mother had fallen ill
with cancer and soon died.

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.408
She died in 1907.
 

00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:57.105
This struck him as a "bolt
out of the blue,"

00:10:57.105 --> 00:10:57.918
he remembered.
 

00:10:57.918 --> 00:11:01.985
He applied for the academy in
Vienna, and, to his horror,

00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:03.509
he was turned down.
 

00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:05.964
He went to Vienna anyway in
February 1908,

00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:07.879
hoping to become an architect.
 

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:11.105
He said later,
"I owe it to that period

00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:13.278
that I grew hardened."
 

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:18.549
He lived in Vienna from
February 1908 until May 1913.

00:11:18.549 --> 00:11:24.070
He said later, after the war,
during his political ascent,

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.061
that it was during that period
that "my eyes were opened

00:11:28.061 --> 00:11:31.919
to the two menaces of which I
had previously scarcely known

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:35.178
the names"--Marxism and
Jewry, the Jews.

00:11:35.178 --> 00:11:41.908
This appears in Mein
Kampf, My Struggle,

00:11:41.908 --> 00:11:46.639
which he wrote when he was in
Landsberg prison not far from

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:51.615
Munich--I even visited the cell
once--after the ill-fated Beer

00:11:51.615 --> 00:11:54.389
Hall Putsch in Munich in 1923.
 

00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:57.658
This was out of retrospect.
 

00:11:57.658 --> 00:12:02.701
There is really no evidence
that he had become a raging

00:12:02.701 --> 00:12:05.129
anti-Semite before 1914.
 

00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:09.908
Yet, anti-Semitism was so
prevalent in Austria.

00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:14.003
Karl Lueger,
who was the mayor of Vienna,

00:12:14.003 --> 00:12:19.323
whom I mentioned before,
was one of the worst in that

00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:20.450
period.
 

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.720
I've given this chilling quote
before, but I'll say it again.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.582
He's the one who said,
"I decide who is a

00:12:25.582 --> 00:12:26.080
Jew."
 

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:33.004
The liberalism that had been in
Vienna in the earlier period was

00:12:33.004 --> 00:12:38.390
hardened, like Hitler,
became hardened into just a

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.700
vast intolerance.
 

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.061
But at the time he said that
these two menaces were known to

00:12:45.061 --> 00:12:46.908
him, he was struggling.
 

00:12:46.908 --> 00:12:53.850
He wanted to be the man in
leadership of the German Reich.

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.200
In saying this,
if you believe Kershaw,

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:02.490
and I do on this and on much
more, this was a fabrication.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.725
The anti-Marxist,
the anti-socialist and

00:13:05.725 --> 00:13:10.288
subsequent anti-communist after
1917, that was there.

00:13:10.288 --> 00:13:14.090
His long diatribes in this sort
of shabby rooming house,

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.538
where they would sit around,
and finally you can imagine one

00:13:16.538 --> 00:13:18.820
by one people just getting tired
of listening to Adolf,

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.840
and going up to their miserable
little rooms to get some sleep,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.899
were against the socialists.
 

00:13:23.899 --> 00:13:27.684
The Austrian socialists,
like their German SPD

00:13:27.684 --> 00:13:31.134
counterparts,
had long marches through the

00:13:31.134 --> 00:13:35.004
streets of Vienna on behalf of
workers' rights,

00:13:35.004 --> 00:13:36.350
etc., etc.
 

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:42.538
Hitler would stand on the porch
of this rooming house and simply

00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:45.288
hate them as they went by.
 

00:13:45.288 --> 00:13:52.210
Yet, Vienna was a huge melting
pot of this enormous empire.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.735
There are all sorts of people
besides German speakers who

00:13:55.735 --> 00:13:56.870
lived in Vienna.
 

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:02.860
Many of the German speakers
were Jews, Freud among them.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:10.919
I've been to Freud's almost
bizarrely recreated office there

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:12.558
in Vienna.
 

00:14:12.558 --> 00:14:17.190
The Jewish population was about
two percent of the population.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.269
In 1910 it was 175,000 people
in Vienna.

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:26.778
Then it grew to 8.6 percent of
the population.

00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:35.472
Later, in Hitler's thundering
speeches, over-the-top speeches,

00:14:35.472 --> 00:14:42.884
he saw Jews as capitalist
exploiters of true Germans,

00:14:42.884 --> 00:14:44.879
etc., etc.
 

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:51.419
This came later.
 

00:14:51.419 --> 00:14:54.788
Lueger, by the way,
anticipated Hitler and lots of

00:14:54.788 --> 00:14:58.033
other people by saying in 1890
that "the Jewish

00:14:58.033 --> 00:15:00.831
problem"
would be solved if all the Jews

00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:03.950
were placed on a large ship and
sunk at sea.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:09.370
When Adolf Hitler lived with
Kubizek in this rooming house,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:14.884
and went to the theatre with
him, he was not yet thinking of

00:15:14.884 --> 00:15:16.100
politics.
 

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.340
What he wanted to do was become
this famous artist.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.234
It is true that he painted
postcards for tourists,

00:15:22.234 --> 00:15:25.970
which he sold to kind of keep
himself afloat.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.417
Kubizek was a piano player,
so in the room was two beds and

00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:31.320
a piano and that was about it.
 

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.855
Sometimes you could imagine
Kubizek playing the piano just

00:15:34.855 --> 00:15:36.529
to try to tune out Adolf.
 

00:15:36.529 --> 00:15:38.200
But he was rather loyal to him.
 

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.158
Hitler began to write a play.
 

00:15:40.158 --> 00:15:42.793
He went to the theatre,
as I said, and he got a little

00:15:42.793 --> 00:15:45.179
bit of inherited money after his
parents died.

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:48.308
He had little interest in women.
 

00:15:48.308 --> 00:15:51.317
Of course, one of the sort of
prevalent rumors is that he was

00:15:51.317 --> 00:15:54.600
impotent,
though as you all know surely,

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.009
he would marry Eva Braun in the
bunker,

00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:02.720
before they took cyanide pills
and killed themselves,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.678
as the Russian tanks could
almost be heard rumbling above.

00:16:06.678 --> 00:16:13.600
We know of no sexual experience
that he had.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.557
He described the ideal woman as
a "cute,

00:16:16.557 --> 00:16:19.177
cuddly, naÃ¯ve little
thing, tender,

00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:21.059
sweet, and stupid."
 

00:16:21.059 --> 00:16:26.504
Of course, like Mussolini,
who was a notorious philanderer

00:16:26.504 --> 00:16:31.190
and used to brag tirelessly
about his sexual exploits,

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:36.087
both Hitler and Mussolini
believed that a woman's place

00:16:36.087 --> 00:16:41.440
was in the home turning out baby
boy soldiers and not in the

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.710
factories.
 

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.034
Of course, one of the ironies
is during the Second World War

00:16:46.034 --> 00:16:49.022
that women are increasingly
doing jobs that Hitler and

00:16:49.022 --> 00:16:51.389
Mussolini thought were
inappropriate,

00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:54.038
simply because the men were
dead.

00:16:54.038 --> 00:16:58.900
Anyway, he was prudish,
seemingly repelled by sex,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:01.678
although fascinated by it.
 

00:17:01.678 --> 00:17:06.971
One of the points that Kershaw
makes is that Kubizek's

00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:11.356
recollections,
along with that of Hitler's

00:17:11.356 --> 00:17:14.971
sister, Paula,
give us a sense of some of the

00:17:14.971 --> 00:17:18.614
things that would remain
characteristic of Hitler until

00:17:18.614 --> 00:17:20.299
his much-deserved end.
 

00:17:20.299 --> 00:17:23.299
Basically, he was lazy.
 

00:17:23.299 --> 00:17:28.338
He was manic at times.
 

00:17:28.338 --> 00:17:31.098
There would be these bursts of
wild enthusiasm for something.

00:17:31.098 --> 00:17:35.170
During the war he would demand
that the generals place maps in

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.106
front of him,
and he would make the decisions

00:17:38.106 --> 00:17:40.509
as the generals secretly moaned.
 

00:17:40.509 --> 00:17:43.979
He considered himself an expert
in military affairs,

00:17:43.979 --> 00:17:44.660
as well.
 

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.242
There was a pathological sense
of reality and a sense of

00:17:49.242 --> 00:17:53.298
proportion,
and a vindictiveness that,

00:17:53.298 --> 00:17:56.210
as most of you that have
followed this at all would know,

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.935
kept the Russian invasion,
stalled it as he punished the

00:17:59.935 --> 00:18:03.037
Yugoslavs,
poured troops into Yugoslavia

00:18:03.037 --> 00:18:07.674
to slaughter people,
and then delayed the famous

00:18:07.674 --> 00:18:12.710
invasion of the Soviet Union on
June 22^(nd).

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.660
I was in Kiev once and the
bells were all ringing.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:23.236
I realized that was the same
time that the German planes had

00:18:23.236 --> 00:18:25.019
first arrived.
 

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:28.539
His intolerance,
his flashes of anger,

00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:32.076
his tediousness,
his sense of predestined

00:18:32.076 --> 00:18:35.144
greatness,
it was all there in the shabby

00:18:35.144 --> 00:18:41.117
little rooming house,
the sense of frustration that

00:18:41.117 --> 00:18:45.700
his genius wasn't recognized.
 

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.940
But there is no evidence of
tirades against Jews.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.049
That would come later.
 

00:18:55.049 --> 00:18:59.289
Another friend of his,
a guy called Hanisch,

00:18:59.289 --> 00:19:05.323
about whom I know nothing,
said after Kubizek had

00:19:05.323 --> 00:19:10.192
disappeared from Vienna,
"In those days Hitler was

00:19:10.192 --> 00:19:11.529
by no means a Jew hater.
 

00:19:11.529 --> 00:19:14.318
He became one afterwards."
 

00:19:14.318 --> 00:19:20.903
In the words of Kershaw,
the First World War made Hitler

00:19:20.903 --> 00:19:22.220
possible.
 

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.532
In 1920 he said,
for the first time in print,

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:30.650
"Jews are to be
exterminated."

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:35.193
This is after the foundation of
the German Workers' Party,

00:19:35.193 --> 00:19:36.470
early in 1919.
 

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:42.960
Of course, it's that party that
would become the Nazis.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.332
There is a picture that may be
doctored--and that apparently is

00:19:47.332 --> 00:19:49.730
no longer in the second edition.
 

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.470
It should be.
 

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.680
It was in the first edition--of
the war starting in Munich.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.609
I think I have mentioned this
before.

00:19:56.609 --> 00:19:58.059
It's a crowd scene.
 

00:19:58.059 --> 00:20:01.240
The war has been announced.
 

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.704
The war is not in Munich,
but all these people are around

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:07.490
the town hall,
and they are just exuberant.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:11.026
You can see the smiling Hitler
beaming, happy,

00:20:11.026 --> 00:20:11.970
fulfilled.
 

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:16.309
He's going to fight for German
nationalism.

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:18.049
He did fight in the war.
 

00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:19.900
He was one of the guys.
 

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.319
He was a comrade.
 

00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:25.089
He was wounded twice.
 

00:20:25.089 --> 00:20:27.288
He was a runner in the war.
 

00:20:27.288 --> 00:20:32.263
He carried messages from
officers to the trenches,

00:20:32.263 --> 00:20:37.339
and then he--not literally ran
but carried them.

00:20:37.339 --> 00:20:38.970
They called them runners.
 

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:44.420
After the war he emerges,
as do troops demobilized in

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:48.718
every country,
facing the challenges of an

00:20:48.718 --> 00:20:50.920
uncertain future.
 

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.324
Nowhere was that future
arguably more uncertain than in

00:20:55.324 --> 00:20:56.140
Germany.
 

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:03.179
Not all veterans of the fight
of the German war cause in World

00:21:03.179 --> 00:21:07.450
War I turned to far-right
politics.

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.301
The SPD, the Socialist Veterans
Organization,

00:21:11.301 --> 00:21:13.930
was the largest of them all.
 

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:18.765
Yet, there are just enormous
continuities between those

00:21:18.765 --> 00:21:24.048
German soldiers who returned
from the war with their weapons

00:21:24.048 --> 00:21:27.990
in their houses joining the Free
Corps,

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:29.339
the Freikorps.
 

00:21:29.339 --> 00:21:30.740
They kept on marching.
 

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.528
They kept on training in their
basements.

00:21:32.528 --> 00:21:36.314
They would come back and
therefore be exposed to all of

00:21:36.314 --> 00:21:39.327
these currents,
the sense of betrayal again,

00:21:39.327 --> 00:21:41.009
as I've said before.
 

00:21:41.009 --> 00:21:42.279
This is the third time.
 

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:45.827
How do you explain to the folks
back home that you've lost the

00:21:45.827 --> 00:21:48.618
war when your troops are way
inside of France?

00:21:48.618 --> 00:21:50.599
They're not perched on the
frontier.

00:21:50.599 --> 00:21:51.700
They're way inside.
 

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.609
So, it's got to be somebody's
fault.

00:21:53.609 --> 00:21:55.880
Whose fault is it?
 

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.559
It's the Jews.
 

00:21:57.559 --> 00:21:59.619
It's the socialists.
 

00:21:59.619 --> 00:22:03.230
And it's the Weimar Republic.
 

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:05.490
These themes come together.
 

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.480
That's a constant theme.
 

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.074
Hitler believed if you told
people the same lies over,

00:22:12.074 --> 00:22:16.930
and over, and over again that
they would believe them.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:18.568
This happens in our country,
too.

00:22:18.568 --> 00:22:23.240
In Hitler's case the lies were
even more pernicious.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:29.423
The revisionism becomes an
official policy of all of these

00:22:29.423 --> 00:22:33.220
rightwing groups,
of all of them.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.307
The thing that's really just
incredible is that the people

00:22:36.307 --> 00:22:39.339
had memories of Hitler--when you
see pictures of him,

00:22:39.339 --> 00:22:42.240
this kind of pauvre type,
you would say in French,

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:46.509
this kind of sad sack wearing
ill-fitting clothes,

00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:50.250
did not have friends.
 

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.230
Kubizek had disappeared.
 

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:55.048
I have no idea what happened to
him.

00:22:55.048 --> 00:22:59.653
He had big hopes for himself
that could never possibly be

00:22:59.653 --> 00:23:00.640
fulfilled.
 

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.894
The idea of this--those of you
who have partied in Munich on

00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:07.420
the tour, or something like
that.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:12.269
I partied in Munich when I was
twenty-years-old.

00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:13.500
We went to these places.
 

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.747
But when you go into these big
places like the

00:23:16.747 --> 00:23:19.922
HofbrÃ¤uhaus,
which was one of the worst,

00:23:19.922 --> 00:23:23.528
and these other places,
it is hard to imagine.

00:23:23.528 --> 00:23:25.650
This is where the rightwing
groups met.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.430
All of a sudden,
this kind of sad sack guy,

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:32.759
who'd jump or be lifted on a
table.

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:34.750
He wasn't terribly athletic.
 

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:41.104
Suddenly, he has people
listening to every word that he

00:23:41.104 --> 00:23:44.400
said for hours,
for hours.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.093
Those speeches,
if you ever heard speeches,

00:23:47.093 --> 00:23:50.299
if your German is really
good--mine is terrible.

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:51.500
It barely exists.
 

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.150
People would listen on the
radio.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:24:01.079
He would build up with this
crescendo announcing the will to

00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:05.309
power, my struggle,
our struggle,

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:08.578
the German people's struggle,
those who have destroyed us,

00:24:08.578 --> 00:24:11.823
those who signed on the dotted
line of the war guilt clause

00:24:11.823 --> 00:24:14.058
that said that Germany started
it all.

00:24:14.058 --> 00:24:17.367
"We will get them
back," he says in 1925,

00:24:17.367 --> 00:24:19.950
when Mein Kampf was
published.

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.309
Isn't it 1925?
 

00:24:21.309 --> 00:24:22.078
I think it's 1925.
 

00:24:22.078 --> 00:24:23.838
He says, "We will kill the
Jews."

00:24:23.838 --> 00:24:28.750
He says "We will expand
elbow room, living space."

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.529
We will expand to the east.
 

00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:32.740
He says this.
 

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.170
You could buy copies of Mein
Kampf in Manhattan.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.920
You could buy copies of it in
Melbourne.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.690
You could buy copies of it
anywhere.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.529
It was translated into a
variety of languages.

00:24:44.529 --> 00:24:47.848
It was all there from the
beginning.

00:24:47.848 --> 00:24:54.170
The consistency in what Hitler
was telling was there all the

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.670
way through.
 

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:57.460
It was there all the way
through.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:02.252
The concrete plans for the
extermination of the Jews,

00:25:02.252 --> 00:25:06.769
as well as the gypsies,
and of gay people as well,

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:10.548
these concrete plans will come
later.

00:25:10.548 --> 00:25:16.076
Dachau in 1933 was built with
Himmler in charge,

00:25:16.076 --> 00:25:22.663
primarily to put communists in
Dachau, and many Jews were

00:25:22.663 --> 00:25:27.250
communists, and later other
people.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.410
I went to Dachau when I was
your age.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:33.771
I remember seeing an old guy
working in the fields right

00:25:33.771 --> 00:25:35.279
outside the wall.
 

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:39.765
He was old enough that that guy
owned that farm back during the

00:25:39.765 --> 00:25:40.200
war.
 

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.440
People knew.
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.650
I'll come back to that in a
minute.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:43.509
They knew.
 

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:46.317
You try to think,
"What did he think when he

00:25:46.317 --> 00:25:47.779
saw the people come in?
 

00:25:47.779 --> 00:25:50.299
What did he think when the
smoke rose?

00:25:50.299 --> 00:25:51.819
What did he think?"
 

00:25:51.819 --> 00:25:53.338
They knew.
 

00:25:53.338 --> 00:25:57.118
They knew and they didn't care,
point.

00:25:57.118 --> 00:26:02.609
If Hitler's themes barely
changed, it raises some very

00:26:02.609 --> 00:26:04.890
important questions.
 

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.750
Who first supported Hitler?
 

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.115
Hitler's support--and I do
write about this a little

00:26:12.115 --> 00:26:16.338
bit--the role of the economic
crisis cannot be underestimated.

00:26:16.338 --> 00:26:19.669
The inflation statistics you
will not want to commit to

00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:21.950
memory, but those are
unbelievable.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:27.238
The only case that I know that
is vaguely like that is Zimbabwe

00:26:27.238 --> 00:26:29.200
in the Mugabe period.
 

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:33.088
This is even worse,
if that is possible.

00:26:33.088 --> 00:26:36.659
Middle-class people who had to
pawn armoires,

00:26:36.659 --> 00:26:40.309
chests, drawers,
silver that had been in their

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:44.608
family for years,
in order to have enough to eat.

00:26:44.608 --> 00:26:46.356
They wouldn't forget,
and they blamed,

00:26:46.356 --> 00:26:47.160
and they hated.
 

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.250
"It's the fault of the
allies.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.769
It's the fault of the Jews.
 

00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:52.410
It's the fault of the
Socialists.

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.069
It's the fault of the
Communists.

00:26:54.069 --> 00:26:56.269
It's the fault of Weimar."
 

00:26:56.269 --> 00:27:02.140
They first flock to Hitler,
the middle classes do.

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:04.877
If this sounds like an orthodox
Marxist interpretation,

00:27:04.877 --> 00:27:07.818
that's what the orthodox
Marxists say and they're right.

00:27:07.818 --> 00:27:13.788
Big business did not flock to
Hitler.

00:27:13.788 --> 00:27:19.240
Big business wanted the
destruction of Weimar.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.788
They helped make Hitler
possible.

00:27:20.788 --> 00:27:24.819
Only one big businessman gave
Hitler a lot of money.

00:27:24.819 --> 00:27:26.220
He got a lot of small donations.
 

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.491
But pretty soon he gets
introduced to the right people,

00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:31.250
the right cocktail parties.
 

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:33.099
They thought he was vulgar.
 

00:27:33.099 --> 00:27:34.759
Quick story.
 

00:27:34.759 --> 00:27:37.348
I had a colleague who died
decades ago.

00:27:37.348 --> 00:27:39.118
He was very nice to me when I
came here.

00:27:39.118 --> 00:27:42.779
He was a German diplomatic
historian called Hans Gatzke.

00:27:42.779 --> 00:27:46.190
He wasn't Jewish and he wasn't
a communist, that's for sure.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:50.546
He left Germany in the
mid-1930s because he didn't like

00:27:50.546 --> 00:27:52.160
what was going on.
 

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.038
He didn't like what was going
on.

00:27:54.038 --> 00:27:58.838
He got a job translating for
the Canadian Olympic team.

00:27:58.838 --> 00:28:01.746
I said to him once,
"Did you ever see

00:28:01.746 --> 00:28:02.809
Hitler?"
 

00:28:02.809 --> 00:28:04.130
He said, "Yes."
 

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:07.118
He was under a stadium in
Berlin.

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:10.890
Like any big stadium,
you've got space underneath.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:12.798
A lot of places have batting
cages.

00:28:12.798 --> 00:28:15.420
Sometimes there's a baseball
stadium or something like that.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.640
He was down there.
 

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.650
He was supposed to meet the
Canadian Olympic team.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.362
All of a sudden he heard this
enormous roar of machinery,

00:28:23.362 --> 00:28:26.608
as machine gun carrying
vehicles are coming in.

00:28:26.608 --> 00:28:29.286
By incredible coincidence,
he had a couple pillars here,

00:28:29.286 --> 00:28:32.058
and just about where Leslie is,
there was Adolf Hitler.

00:28:32.058 --> 00:28:35.336
He was scared,
because there were machine

00:28:35.336 --> 00:28:35.910
guns.
 

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:37.160
He stood there frozen.
 

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.480
Would they gun him down? No.
 

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.640
He just was standing there.
 

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.529
I said, "What did you
think?

00:28:45.529 --> 00:28:49.127
You are fifteen yards away from
Adolf Hitler,

00:28:49.127 --> 00:28:51.009
less than that."
 

00:28:51.009 --> 00:28:54.069
He said, "I had a weird
reaction.

00:28:54.069 --> 00:28:55.440
He was vulgar.
 

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.750
He was an Austrian corporal.
 

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:02.940
He sneezed and he blew his nose
on his sleeve."

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.700
That's what Gatzke remembered.
 

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.058
Big business--Gatzke was a
moderate political.

00:29:09.058 --> 00:29:15.519
He believed in the Weimar
Republic.

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:18.064
He was a very good guy,
a very kind of aristocratic

00:29:18.064 --> 00:29:18.369
guy.
 

00:29:18.369 --> 00:29:19.950
He was a Rhinelander.
 

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.872
His reaction was the same as
big business,

00:29:22.872 --> 00:29:26.578
except that big business wanted
to destroy Weimar.

00:29:26.578 --> 00:29:29.039
The reaction was that Hitler
was a commoner.

00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:30.078
He's vulgar.
 

00:29:30.078 --> 00:29:33.509
"We've got him locked
in," they said in 1933.

00:29:33.509 --> 00:29:34.769
"We've got him boxed in.
 

00:29:34.769 --> 00:29:37.179
We can use him to our advantage
and then have a military

00:29:37.179 --> 00:29:38.098
dictatorship."
 

00:29:38.098 --> 00:29:40.690
When von Stauffenberg tries to
kill Hitler,

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.577
and puts a bomb under the table
that blows up but doesn't kill

00:29:43.577 --> 00:29:44.950
Hitler because a big,
old,

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:49.858
German wooden barrier the table
stood on,

00:29:49.858 --> 00:29:52.720
he wasn't trying to bring
parliamentary regime back to

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.259
Germany.
 

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:54.890
He wanted a military
dictatorship.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:30:00.095
Hitler was supported by the
middle classes

00:30:00.095 --> 00:30:04.920
disproportionately at the
beginning.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.477
But in all classes people
supported him,

00:30:08.477 --> 00:30:10.119
workers less so.
 

00:30:10.119 --> 00:30:12.609
But they break in 1933.
 

00:30:12.609 --> 00:30:13.890
They destroy the unions.
 

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:16.118
They destroy the Communist
Party.

00:30:16.118 --> 00:30:19.041
They use the Reichstag fire,
which is actually set by the

00:30:19.041 --> 00:30:21.130
guy probably now we think,
the Dutch guy,

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.799
whom I write about in there.
 

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:24.660
They destroy the unions.
 

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.598
They destroy the possibility of
resistance.

00:30:26.598 --> 00:30:29.682
But lots of workers were there,
sieg heil,

00:30:29.682 --> 00:30:32.380
too, but less so than the other
classes.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.700
What about religion?
 

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.099
Hitler was a southerner.
 

00:30:36.099 --> 00:30:37.960
He never liked Berlin at all.
 

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:42.730
He wanted to raze it and then
this sort of art deco monument

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.509
of his own planning.
 

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:46.720
He was a southern guy.
 

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.373
One of the places where he
first does very well is

00:30:49.373 --> 00:30:51.971
Schleswig-Holstein,
part of it used to be Danish,

00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:53.759
and it is totally Protestant.
 

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:58.173
The Catholic Church rings the
bell and reads what Hitler wants

00:30:58.173 --> 00:30:59.910
read from the sermons.
 

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:08.450
They were happy to have Hitler
there, as are the Protestants.

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.788
There's no doubt about that.
 

00:31:11.788 --> 00:31:16.440
Fascism is in the air all over
the place.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:22.690
The main elements of fascism
that I list in that book,

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.343
if you think about them,
they all apply to Hitler and to

00:31:25.343 --> 00:31:27.554
the people who followed him:
anti-communist,

00:31:27.554 --> 00:31:29.200
anti-socialist,
anti-Weimar,

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.450
the role of the economic crisis
with long,

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:34.750
long memories,
and hating the allies,

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.048
and hating the Jews,
and hating the Socialists.

00:31:37.048 --> 00:31:42.580
The Nazis and other fascist
groups are better at saying whom

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.519
they were against than what they
wanted.

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:50.279
What they want is
ultra-nationalism.

00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:52.673
What they want is a
totalitarian state and the

00:31:52.673 --> 00:31:54.589
destruction of parliamentary
rule.

00:31:54.589 --> 00:31:56.400
What they want is a dictator.
 

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.868
They want a caudillo,
as Franco was.

00:31:59.868 --> 00:32:03.259
They want a duce,
as Mussolini called himself.

00:32:03.259 --> 00:32:04.700
They want a fÃ¼hrer.
 

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.196
They want a leader who
incarnates in that mystical

00:32:08.196 --> 00:32:12.263
body, as they would view it,
the aspirations of the German

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:13.048
people.
 

00:32:13.048 --> 00:32:17.380
Part of who you were is who you
were excluding.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.470
You have a vÃ¶lkisch
community,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.410
in the perverse biological
racism of these people,

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:26.000
and other people who aren't in
it,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:26.920
too bad for them.
 

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.813
If they are "work
shy," Germans who don't

00:32:28.813 --> 00:32:31.635
want to work,
then they're not really part of

00:32:31.635 --> 00:32:34.210
the vÃ¶lkisch
community.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.920
"I decide who's a Jew and
who isn't."

00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.858
That's what Lueger said.
 

00:32:36.858 --> 00:32:38.644
Hitler says,
and this is the horror of it

00:32:38.644 --> 00:32:41.318
all, "We decide who will
live and who will die."

00:32:41.318 --> 00:32:44.548
They're using euthanasia as a
tool to kill people who are

00:32:44.548 --> 00:32:47.373
mentally handicapped,
and even some people who are

00:32:47.373 --> 00:32:48.930
physically handicapped.
 

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:50.151
Pretty soon,
in the late 1930s,

00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:51.656
the Germans say,
"Wait, these are

00:32:51.656 --> 00:32:52.390
Germans."
 

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.689
If they're Jews who may be
Germans, we don't consider them

00:32:55.689 --> 00:32:56.210
German.
 

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:57.339
That's okay.
 

00:32:57.339 --> 00:32:58.220
Get rid of them.
 

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.328
They pull back on that.
 

00:33:00.328 --> 00:33:05.614
But that's there from the
beginning, ultra nationalistic,

00:33:05.614 --> 00:33:08.539
ultra antiparliamentarianism.
 

00:33:08.539 --> 00:33:10.338
You want the guy.
 

00:33:10.338 --> 00:33:13.316
He's going to represent you and
he's going to tell you what to

00:33:13.316 --> 00:33:13.559
do.
 

00:33:13.559 --> 00:33:16.509
The terror is there.
 

00:33:16.509 --> 00:33:18.009
The violence is there.
 

00:33:18.009 --> 00:33:19.308
The Gestapo.
 

00:33:19.308 --> 00:33:23.420
There are hundreds of thousands
of denunciations.

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.586
If you denounce somebody,
you could be sending them to

00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:26.650
torture and their death.
 

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.868
There's no question about that.
 

00:33:28.868 --> 00:33:30.788
There are denunciations all the
time.

00:33:30.788 --> 00:33:32.608
"Hey, my neighbor,
I think he's Jewish.

00:33:32.608 --> 00:33:35.558
I know my neighbor down the
hall.

00:33:35.558 --> 00:33:39.714
I know he was a big guy in the
German Socialist Party,

00:33:39.714 --> 00:33:40.500
the SPD.
 

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:43.849
I know that the butcher around
the street, I might want his

00:33:43.849 --> 00:33:45.930
store, because I'm a butcher,
too.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.730
I know he was a communist
activist until 1933."

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:50.980
You see denunciations.
 

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.900
they've got them all the time.
 

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.160
They've got them all the time.
 

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.376
Here's a quote,
somebody describing one of the

00:33:57.376 --> 00:34:02.590
Gestapo offices and the
bureaucratization of terror:

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:08.798
"Grimy corridors,
offices furnished with Spartan

00:34:08.798 --> 00:34:12.230
simplicity, threats,
kicks,

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.907
troops chasing chained men up
and down the reaches of the

00:34:14.907 --> 00:34:17.219
building, shouting,
rows of girls and women

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:20.179
standing with their noses and
toes against the wall,

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.311
overflowing ashtrays,
portraits of Hitler and his

00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:24.750
aids,
the smell of coffee,

00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:27.507
smartly-dressed girls working
at a high speed behind

00:34:27.507 --> 00:34:29.764
typewriters,
girls seemingly indifferent to

00:34:29.764 --> 00:34:31.449
the squalor and agony about
them,

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:33.920
stacks of confiscated
publications,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.170
printing machines,
books and pictures,

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:40.230
and Gestapo agents asleep on
the tables."

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:44.159
Nobody had any illusion about
what was going on.

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.750
They didn't just rule through
terror.

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:51.539
The SS, by the way,
everybody knows about the SS.

00:34:51.539 --> 00:34:53.179
They destroy the SA.
 

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.257
Ernst RÃ¶hm challenges
Hitler, and in the Night of the

00:34:56.257 --> 00:34:58.309
Long Knives, they wipe them all
out.

00:34:58.309 --> 00:35:02.340
The SS was a form of sort of
social mobility for people.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.429
These young guys come back
after the war.

00:35:04.429 --> 00:35:05.469
There was no work.
 

00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:08.518
Pretty soon in the 1920s--the
SS, you've got a uniform.

00:35:08.518 --> 00:35:11.556
You can go beat the hell out of
communists, Jews,

00:35:11.556 --> 00:35:14.909
or anyone else and there's
no--the judges are all Nazi

00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:17.630
sympathizers or rightwing
sympathizers.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.329
They were all trained in the
Empire.

00:35:19.329 --> 00:35:23.724
You can kill somebody and
you'll be out of jail in a very

00:35:23.724 --> 00:35:25.530
short matter of time.
 

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:32.969
You're working with impunity,
especially in Prussia where

00:35:32.969 --> 00:35:39.079
GÃ¶ring is the minister of
the interior.

00:35:39.079 --> 00:35:40.429
It is all routinized.
 

00:35:40.429 --> 00:35:42.050
It is all there.
 

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.550
They don't rule just through
terror.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:49.179
That's what I did not emphasize
enough in what you've read.

00:35:49.179 --> 00:35:51.179
It's going to be in the next
edition.

00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:54.530
Hitler promises order.
 

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:59.920
Order is zero tolerance on
petty crime, for example.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:04.346
They have police who are called
the Kripo (appropriately enough,

00:36:04.346 --> 00:36:07.016
in the English
translation--;pronounced

00:36:07.016 --> 00:36:07.929
creap-o).
 

00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:10.280
They are sort of your basic
police.

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.791
They are not the Gestapo.
 

00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:14.275
They go out,
and people who are lounging

00:36:14.275 --> 00:36:15.971
about,
who are "work shy,"

00:36:15.971 --> 00:36:18.230
that's a dangerous thing to be,
"work shy."

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.425
Petty criminals,
people who are hungry,

00:36:20.425 --> 00:36:23.775
who are stealing apples off of
fruit stands and things like

00:36:23.775 --> 00:36:26.260
that, they go out and make war
on them.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:30.420
The German population nods
enthusiastically,

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.550
overall, as a whole.
 

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.579
The war on crimes is something
they like.

00:36:35.579 --> 00:36:37.110
Also, there's the economy.
 

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:41.320
Hitler got credit from many
German people for having revived

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.820
the German economy.
 

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.989
How does he do that?
 

00:36:43.989 --> 00:36:47.213
He does it by violating the
statutes of the Treaty of

00:36:47.213 --> 00:36:48.019
Versailles.
 

00:36:48.019 --> 00:36:49.760
They're preparing for war.
 

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.030
He's preparing for war all the
way through.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.476
If the Rhineland occupation,
the French and the Belgians had

00:36:55.476 --> 00:36:57.931
put up a fuss,
it's possible that the whole

00:36:57.931 --> 00:37:00.269
thing could have been stopped
there.

00:37:00.269 --> 00:37:01.610
It's possible.
 

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.800
The generals are saying,
"Mein Fuhrer,

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:10.829
we're not really ready yet for
war," while he is freezing

00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:14.438
his opponents,
and they capitulate at one time

00:37:14.438 --> 00:37:16.722
after another,
and the famous story of Neville

00:37:16.722 --> 00:37:18.822
Chamberlain,
who'd returned bringing peace

00:37:18.822 --> 00:37:21.329
in his time after having sold
out Czechoslovakia.

00:37:21.329 --> 00:37:24.570
But the German economy does
revive.

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:28.648
There are still huge gaps
between the wealthy and people

00:37:28.648 --> 00:37:31.320
who aren't wealthy,
enormous gaps.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.404
But the German economy does
revive because of the same thing

00:37:34.404 --> 00:37:37.331
that happens in the United
States in World War II--you're

00:37:37.331 --> 00:37:40.349
turning out,
transforming the war economy.

00:37:40.349 --> 00:37:41.719
That's exactly what happens.
 

00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:42.849
He takes credit for this.
 

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:44.630
There are a lot of flashy
gestures.

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.619
The VW--I went around Europe in
a VW with a couple of my

00:37:47.619 --> 00:37:49.956
friends, sleeping on beaches,
the little VW,

00:37:49.956 --> 00:37:50.989
the Volkswagen.
 

00:37:50.989 --> 00:37:52.980
But only one of them was ever
produced.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.581
He promises the German people a
Volkswagen, but only one model

00:37:56.581 --> 00:37:59.239
ever comes off,
for the press and all that.

00:37:59.239 --> 00:38:00.320
The Autobahn.
 

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.389
They're going to have routes,
autobahns all over.

00:38:02.389 --> 00:38:05.445
Now there are in Germany and
people driving 500 miles an hour

00:38:05.445 --> 00:38:06.260
with impunity.
 

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:13.612
There are only 500 or miles of
autobahn done by the time he's

00:38:13.612 --> 00:38:14.960
finished.
 

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.360
Strength through joy.
 

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.146
He announces a program that the
Germans who have never been on

00:38:19.146 --> 00:38:21.980
vacation, ordinary working-class
Germans can go on vacation.

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.590
Some people did go on vacation.
 

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:27.967
They all get drunk on cruise
boats all over the place,

00:38:27.967 --> 00:38:30.530
but hardly anyone gets to go.
 

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:32.630
But he gets credit for it.
 

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.349
He seemed to be producing.
 

00:38:34.349 --> 00:38:36.130
He seemed to be producing.
 

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.719
And, in a country in which
anti-Semitism,

00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:42.847
despite the fact that Jews were
terribly assimilated,

00:38:42.847 --> 00:38:45.798
was endemic,
they liked the fact the Jews

00:38:45.798 --> 00:38:46.929
are disappearing.
 

00:38:46.929 --> 00:38:49.449
They like it and they know it.
 

00:38:49.449 --> 00:38:52.972
It's sheer nonsense to think
that people didn't know what was

00:38:52.972 --> 00:38:53.619
going on.
 

00:38:53.619 --> 00:38:56.739
These trials are put in the
papers all the time.

00:38:56.739 --> 00:38:57.960
"So-and-so has been
condemned,

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:01.440
being sent away to Dachau
because of anti-state behavior,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.690
anti-German behavior,"
you name it.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:04.659
People know.
 

00:39:04.659 --> 00:39:05.760
They have no doubts about it.
 

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.239
Where do they think the trains
are going?

00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:08.829
They can kind of imagine.
 

00:39:08.829 --> 00:39:12.329
Where are these people coming
from?

00:39:12.329 --> 00:39:14.360
When all the Polish workers are
coming in,

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.559
being brought in as sort of
slave labor,

00:39:16.559 --> 00:39:18.449
the ones who haven't been
destroyed,

00:39:18.449 --> 00:39:20.929
when they're coming to work in
the factories,

00:39:20.929 --> 00:39:22.829
where do these people think
their families were?

00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:24.119
They're all dead.
 

00:39:24.119 --> 00:39:27.199
That's why Ordinary Men
is such a chilling book.

00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:31.061
How these people,
this police officer brigade in

00:39:31.061 --> 00:39:33.297
Hamburg,
how these people can put

00:39:33.297 --> 00:39:36.807
bullets in the backs of heads of
old ladies and little children

00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:38.960
in the killing fields around
Lodz,

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.510
or anywhere else in Poland,
is just an extraordinary story.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:42.449
People knew.
 

00:39:42.449 --> 00:39:43.780
Not everybody knew,
but they knew.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:45.210
They knew.
 

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:48.800
For people who wanted order,
this was their idea.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.119
This was the racial idea of
order.

00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:51.309
The universities.
 

00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:52.389
What happens to the
universities?

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:54.489
Certain fields do real well.
 

00:39:54.489 --> 00:39:55.730
Racial hygiene.
 

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.019
They establish chairs in racial
hygiene.

00:39:58.019 --> 00:39:59.570
German folklore.
 

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:01.739
They establish chairs in German
folklore.

00:40:01.739 --> 00:40:03.929
Physics does very well,
for obvious reasons.

00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:05.610
Physics equals rockets.
 

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:08.914
Military history,
chairs in military history,

00:40:08.914 --> 00:40:12.972
chairs in German history,
chairs particularly in German

00:40:12.972 --> 00:40:14.550
medieval history.
 

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:18.161
But anything else,
your basic history,

00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:21.088
German literature,
for example,

00:40:21.088 --> 00:40:23.530
doesn't do very well.
 

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.757
There was a famous headline
that is in the book saluting the

00:40:27.757 --> 00:40:31.340
fact that there were fewer
visits to libraries,

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.692
and people were checking out
books in far fewer numbers than

00:40:33.692 --> 00:40:34.409
they did before.
 

00:40:34.409 --> 00:40:36.510
How do they pull this off?
 

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.920
They pull it off through the
atomization of society.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.655
There's a really wonderful book
called The Nazi Seizure of

00:40:43.655 --> 00:40:47.452
Power, written by William
Sheridan Allen about a town near

00:40:47.452 --> 00:40:48.199
Hanover.
 

00:40:48.199 --> 00:40:50.039
He changes the name of the town.
 

00:40:50.039 --> 00:40:53.400
People were so proud of that
book in the 1960s.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.721
In the 1970s they put stacks of
them and said,

00:40:55.721 --> 00:40:56.650
"That's us.
 

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.530
That's us who were beating up
the Jews.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.070
That's us who were beating up
the communists.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.480
We are so proud."
 

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.429
It's a very good book.
 

00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:09.380
There's another good book by
Rudy Koshar, a friend of mine at

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:12.268
Wisconsin on the town of
Marburg.

00:41:12.268 --> 00:41:15.059
What they do is they get Nazis
into every voluntary

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:17.849
association, basically,
and they take them over.

00:41:17.849 --> 00:41:21.092
What you have is the
atomization of society,

00:41:21.092 --> 00:41:25.389
what Ian Kershaw calls
"going to the Fuhrer."

00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:28.469
The only thing left is the
family.

00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:31.699
You protect yourself and the
family, or you thrive in the

00:41:31.699 --> 00:41:33.719
family, but you're in the
family.

00:41:33.719 --> 00:41:37.050
Your children are in Hitler
youth.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:43.090
There is no possible organized
way of opposition.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:44.920
Soccer clubs,
football clubs,

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.449
everything is part of the
atomization because it's been

00:41:48.449 --> 00:41:50.280
taken over by the Nazis.
 

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.949
There is almost no resistance
in Germany.

00:41:52.949 --> 00:41:54.610
I'll talk a little bit about
this next time.

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:57.789
This was a regime that is
capable,

00:41:57.789 --> 00:42:00.692
as they did in Dusseldorf,
of hanging sixteen-year-old

00:42:00.692 --> 00:42:03.489
boys because they listened to
Benny Goodman,

00:42:03.489 --> 00:42:04.920
or were considered to be
slackers,

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.000
or "work shy."
 

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.920
There's that phrase again.
 

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:14.335
This atomization of German
society makes all of this

00:42:14.335 --> 00:42:15.719
possible.
 

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:18.489
When Stauffenberg places his
bomb,

00:42:18.489 --> 00:42:20.500
and the thing blows up and it
doesn't kill Hitler,

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:23.086
Hitler amused himself and his
friends by--all of the people

00:42:23.086 --> 00:42:25.139
and all of the families of
people involved,

00:42:25.139 --> 00:42:29.409
they filmed them being slowly
strangled with wire.

00:42:29.409 --> 00:42:31.860
They laughed as they watched
the film.

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.599
The most chilling thing,
even more than that,

00:42:34.599 --> 00:42:37.737
is that Germans pour into the
street in thirty or forty

00:42:37.737 --> 00:42:40.545
different cities,
as bombs have been raining down

00:42:40.545 --> 00:42:41.289
all the time.
 

00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:42.829
They thank God.
 

00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:44.969
Mein Gott,
you saved our Fuhrer!

00:42:44.969 --> 00:42:49.159
That's extraordinarily
difficult to explain.

00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:52.735
By 1944, the armies are full of
old men and boys,

00:42:52.735 --> 00:42:55.940
because basically everybody
else is dead.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:58.460
They keep fighting.
 

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.820
They fight with astonishing,
foolish courage,

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:05.099
until the bitter end.
 

00:43:05.099 --> 00:43:08.487
They believed,
not everybody believed,

00:43:08.487 --> 00:43:10.869
there will be a revival.
 

00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:15.612
Even the German Federal
Republic was just replete with

00:43:15.612 --> 00:43:21.070
very proud former Nazis who take
hugely important positions in

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:22.949
power after that.
 

00:43:22.949 --> 00:43:26.128
Of course, the good old
Americans help a lot of these

00:43:26.128 --> 00:43:29.920
Nazi war criminals escape to
Paraguay and places like that,

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.534
in exchange for information
about communist movements and

00:43:33.534 --> 00:43:34.889
that sort of thing.
 

00:43:34.889 --> 00:43:35.760
They believed.
 

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:36.800
They believed.
 

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.646
Not everybody believed,
but that's one of the scariest

00:43:40.646 --> 00:43:44.782
things about the whole thing,
that it was sieg heil

00:43:44.782 --> 00:43:46.090
until the end.
 

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.166
Again, not for everybody,
not for everybody,

00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:52.099
but for some social classes and
others.

00:43:52.099 --> 00:43:55.599
You find this in other
countries, and I'll talk a

00:43:55.599 --> 00:43:59.757
little bit about that when--I
guess I'll talk mostly about

00:43:59.757 --> 00:44:01.289
France next time.
 

00:44:07.289 --> 00:44:13.469
Hitler gives the German people
what they want.

00:44:13.469 --> 00:44:17.829
His prestige,
every time he stands down the

00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:22.429
British and the French,
every time that he pulls this

00:44:22.429 --> 00:44:25.159
off--the occupation of the
Rhineland,

00:44:25.159 --> 00:44:31.489
the absorption of the Sudeten
part of Bohemia,

00:44:31.489 --> 00:44:33.130
and then they just take over
the whole country,

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:36.119
the Anschluss--where he's
greeted enthusiastically by the

00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:36.599
crowds.
 

00:44:36.599 --> 00:44:40.110
You can see these photos of the
adoring Viennese crowds.

00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:45.750
Where was the Vienna of calm
concerts?

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.320
It became the Vienna of Wagner.
 

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.349
It became the Vienna of
saluting Hitler and then going

00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:54.239
out and beating up and killing
Jews.

00:44:54.239 --> 00:45:01.199
Something like 100 Jews are
murdered in Vienna when Hitler

00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:04.130
arrives, to celebrate.
 

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:07.690
They, too, believed.
 

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:10.686
One of the dark secrets was the
Nazi past of the former

00:45:10.686 --> 00:45:13.849
Secretary General of the United
Nations, Kurt Waldheim.

00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:18.010
All this came out before most
of you were reading newspapers.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:20.539
Some of you were reading them
back then.

00:45:20.539 --> 00:45:23.000
It was about fifteen years ago,
or something like that.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.949
The people knew.
 

00:45:26.949 --> 00:45:32.460
Those are really the big points
that I wanted to make.

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:37.625
When you were reading,
German women or German men

00:45:37.625 --> 00:45:41.422
waiting to get their hair done,
when you read a popular

00:45:41.422 --> 00:45:46.052
newspaper or popular magazine,
all of which had articles about

00:45:46.052 --> 00:45:48.014
Hitler,
and this sort of entourage and

00:45:48.014 --> 00:45:50.710
all that,
and you read a cheery headline,

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.699
such as "Gas Masks for
Children Now Readied."

00:45:53.699 --> 00:45:58.670
You sort of nodded and said,
"We'll be ready for the

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.179
struggle."
 

00:46:00.179 --> 00:46:05.195
What happened was Hitler's
book, Mein Kampf, became

00:46:05.195 --> 00:46:10.829
perceived of and adopted by the
majority of people in Germany.

00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:17.003
Tragically enough,
they remain with Adolf Hitler

00:46:17.003 --> 00:46:23.309
and the Nazis until the very,
very bitter end.

00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:27.753
Of course, it's important to
see the context is that in all

00:46:27.753 --> 00:46:30.795
of these places,
whether you're talking about

00:46:30.795 --> 00:46:32.715
Brussels,
whether you're talking about

00:46:32.715 --> 00:46:36.614
Amsterdam,
whether you're talking about

00:46:36.614 --> 00:46:39.867
Prague,
anyplace you're talking about

00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:42.846
in Europe,
or Oswald Mosley strutting

00:46:42.846 --> 00:46:47.159
through Hyde Park with his
little Naziling followers.

00:46:47.159 --> 00:46:50.570
Hitler was just the most
violent,

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:54.360
the most egregious,
the most horrible,

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:57.925
the most tragic example of what
was a general phenomenon

00:46:57.925 --> 00:47:02.842
throughout the entire period,
at different degrees of success

00:47:02.842 --> 00:47:05.409
during the 1920s and 1930s.
 

00:47:05.409 --> 00:47:11.409
The war that began in 1914
basically does not end,

00:47:11.409 --> 00:47:19.630
at least in Europe,
until the defeat finally of

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:23.889
Germany,
and the death of Adolf Hitler,

00:47:23.889 --> 00:47:25.780
still at a relatively young
age,

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.446
in the bunker in Berlin.

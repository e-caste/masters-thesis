00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.298
I quoted to you at length from
the Tudor Homily on Obedience

00:00:06.298 --> 00:00:11.020
first published in 1547 with
its stress on hierarchy,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.017
degree, order,
subordination,

00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:15.730
and obedience.
 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.163
And yet as you know within two
years of the publication of that

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:24.668
homily in 1547 there was a wave
of peasant protest in 1549 right

00:00:24.668 --> 00:00:29.460
across the south of England and
open rebellion in East Anglia,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.780
Kett's Rebellion.
 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.373
This was a society in which the
common people below the level of

00:00:37.373 --> 00:00:41.901
the 'middling sort',
the leaders of village society,

00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:44.920
had no formal political voice.
 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.080
They were, as Sir Thomas Smith
put it,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.184
"to be ruled over and not
to rule others,"

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:55.691
and yet not infrequently we
find those same common people

00:00:55.691 --> 00:01:00.520
raising their voices in protest
and sometimes in demand.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.704
It was a society in which the
gentry rulers regarded their

00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:08.670
social inferiors with a great
deal of condescension.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.665
The language they used to
describe them says it all:

00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:13.838
the "meaner sort of
people,"

00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:16.775
"the clowns,"
"the ruder sort,"

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.480
"the rabble."
 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.280
And they expected their
deference.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.836
Men were expected to uncover
their heads before their social

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:26.973
superiors,
do them "hat honor,"

00:01:26.973 --> 00:01:31.302
as it was called,
women were expected to bob a

00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:34.780
curtsy,
and yet this condescension on

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.012
the part of the gentry was
tinged with anxiety and an

00:01:39.012 --> 00:01:41.780
expectation of insubordination.
 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.224
As one of them,
Sir John Oglander,

00:01:44.224 --> 00:01:48.522
put it, "the common people
are always apt to rebel and

00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:51.560
mutiny upon the least
occasion."

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.180
Well, how can one reconcile all
of these paradoxes?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.379
Well, maybe the answer is in
fact simple enough.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:03.218
Deference and obedience was the
norm,

00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:08.509
it was instilled by precept,
it was learned by repeated

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.895
daily experience,
and yet periodically it could

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:16.408
perhaps be destabilized by
circumstances;

00:02:16.408 --> 00:02:20.663
a famine perhaps,
a particularly callous example

00:02:20.663 --> 00:02:23.560
of exploitation by a landlord.
 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.210
Things like that could perhaps
render people desperate,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.360
leading them to rise in a
convulsive spasm of anger and

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.699
despair,
and when that happened all good

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:38.580
order could be threatened by the
mob,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.531
what the gentry called the
"many-headed monster,"

00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:44.764
the common people,
"the beast with many

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:45.889
heads."
 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.220
Well, it's a powerful image and
not without historical

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.573
foundation,
and yet to characterize all or

00:02:52.573 --> 00:02:56.942
even most forms of popular
disturbance in early modern

00:02:56.942 --> 00:03:00.900
England in this way is
profoundly misleading.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.829
A generation of research on
popular protest has shown just

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.378
how inadequate that stereotype
is,

00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:10.854
and the resulting shift of
perception amongst historians is

00:03:10.854 --> 00:03:13.730
reflected in the kind of
language they now use to

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.288
describe these things.
 

00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:18.098
People nowadays talk little
about 'the mob';

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:21.038
they talk more about 'the
crowd'.

00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:25.646
They talk less about 'revolt'
and more about 'protest and

00:03:25.646 --> 00:03:26.800
resistance'.
 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.722
We've moved from the study of
'riots' to the study of what

00:03:31.722 --> 00:03:35.348
people term 'popular political
culture'.

00:03:35.348 --> 00:03:38.500
Now whether that term is fully
justified we'll see,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.193
but the evidence at least
reveals that the common people

00:03:42.193 --> 00:03:46.155
were neither unconditionally
deferential to their rulers nor

00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:49.782
on the other hand were they
secretly alienated from the

00:03:49.782 --> 00:03:53.611
existing social order,
but rather, as one laboring man

00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:57.133
from Northamptonshire in the
English Midlands put it on one

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:00.330
of these occasions,
they could--to quote him,

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.437
they could "tell well
enough how to devise a means to

00:04:04.437 --> 00:04:06.240
help themselves."
 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.877
And they could do that within
the parameters of the prevailing

00:04:11.877 --> 00:04:16.961
structures of power and
authority within which they were

00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:21.954
obliged to work because as yet
no one had suggested any

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:24.449
possible alternative.
 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.901
Popular protest has been well
described by John Walter as

00:04:27.901 --> 00:04:30.738
being in the first instance a
"politics of

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:33.759
subsistence,"
a politics of subsistence.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.389
Its most immediate objectives
were frequently the defense or

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.639
the amelioration of a
threatening economic situation.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.649
The most obvious case of that
was in the case of food riots.

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:53.259
These tended to occur in years
of dearth;

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.887
bad harvest years when grain
was in short supply and the

00:04:56.887 --> 00:05:03.358
prices of food rocketed,
years like 1587,1594 to '7,1622

00:05:03.358 --> 00:05:10.600
to '3,
1631,1647 to '8, and so on.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.538
These riots also occurred in
years of industrial depression

00:05:14.538 --> 00:05:18.682
when rural industrial workers in
particular who were dependent

00:05:18.682 --> 00:05:22.553
upon the market for most of
their food supplies found that

00:05:22.553 --> 00:05:26.358
they lacked the income to supply
themselves because their

00:05:26.358 --> 00:05:30.569
employers were no longer able to
put out work to them.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.809
The 1620s saw some very bad
industrial depressions of that

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:35.329
kind.
 

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:38.853
Well, either circumstance,
a bad harvest or a year of

00:05:38.853 --> 00:05:42.500
industrial slump,
could produce a sudden and

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.697
catastrophic decline in what
economists refer to as people's

00:05:47.697 --> 00:05:51.310
'exchange entitlements' as
consumers,

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.560
or in plain English,
they were unable to afford the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.600
food that they needed.
 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.338
Agrarian disturbances were
rather less predictable,

00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:05.420
but they occurred sporadically
and occasionally in areas,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.209
or individual communities,
where the manorial tenants,

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:11.569
or the local population more
generally,

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:16.473
were confronted with changes
which threatened to undermine

00:06:16.473 --> 00:06:21.810
the viability of particular
patterns of local rural economy.

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.461
So, in 1536,
as you know,

00:06:23.461 --> 00:06:27.317
part of the causes of the
Pilgrimage of Grace rising were

00:06:27.317 --> 00:06:31.653
protests against the pushing up
of entry fines for land in parts

00:06:31.653 --> 00:06:33.720
of northwestern England.
 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.732
In 1549, Kett's Rebellion was
rooted in protests against the

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:42.470
exploitation of landlords'
grazing rights.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.810
But above all in the late
sixteenth and early seventeenth

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.853
centuries the grievance which
motivated protests was

00:06:48.853 --> 00:06:51.862
enclosure;
enclosure of the land which

00:06:51.862 --> 00:06:55.000
extinguished rights of common
pasture;

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.319
pasture rights which were
particularly valued.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.874
So, for example,
in the small town of

00:06:59.874 --> 00:07:02.819
Berkhamstead,
which is just to the north-west

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.329
of London in the county of
Hertfordshire,

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:10.882
in 1618, several villages
existed around a very large area

00:07:10.882 --> 00:07:17.115
of common land on which they all
had rights to graze their cattle

00:07:17.115 --> 00:07:20.391
and sheep;
they had rights to put their

00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:24.492
pigs into the woodland;
they had rights to gather fuel

00:07:24.492 --> 00:07:29.088
and wild fruits and to capture
small animals for the pot,

00:07:29.088 --> 00:07:31.139
rabbits in particular.
 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:34.163
The loss of all that,
when attempts were made to

00:07:34.163 --> 00:07:37.939
enclose Berkhamstead common,
were deeply resented,

00:07:37.939 --> 00:07:41.752
and that's the kind of
situation that so often

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:42.769
occurred.
 

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:47.069
Now situations of that kind
occurred sporadically though

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:50.120
sometimes they also came in
clusters.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.485
In 1607, there was a wave of
enclosures in villages where the

00:07:54.485 --> 00:07:57.250
three counties of
Northamptonshire,

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:01.071
Warwickshire,
and Leicestershire met in the

00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:02.800
Midlands up here.
 

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.139
That was known as the 'Midland
Rising' because there was a kind

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:10.430
of scattering of riots across
the whole area.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:14.661
Or again in 1628 to 1632 there
occurred what's known as the

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:19.329
'Western Rising' in the forested
areas of the west of England.

00:08:19.329 --> 00:08:22.367
Those areas were being
disafforested and cleared and

00:08:22.367 --> 00:08:24.689
the land turned into enclosed
farms,

00:08:24.689 --> 00:08:28.288
and much resistance sprang up
amongst those who had formerly

00:08:28.288 --> 00:08:30.790
enjoyed common rights in the
woodlands.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.070
And finally in the--from the
1630s,

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.840
in response to the drainage of
the Fenlands of eastern England

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.687
and the allocation of reclaimed
land in enclosed farms to those

00:08:43.687 --> 00:08:46.659
who invested in that
improvement,

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.950
there was a wave of resistance.
 

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.624
The people of the Fens to the
south of the Wash and in

00:08:52.624 --> 00:08:56.192
Lincolnshire lost,
as a result of the drainage,

00:08:56.192 --> 00:08:59.509
their grazing rights,
their fishing rights,

00:08:59.509 --> 00:09:04.003
their wildfowling rights,
the rights to gather rushes and

00:09:04.003 --> 00:09:08.197
turf for thatch or fuel,
and they bitterly resisted

00:09:08.197 --> 00:09:13.109
these changes in the so-called
'Fenland Riots' which actually

00:09:13.109 --> 00:09:16.220
sputtered on for over thirty
years.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.629
Okay.
 

00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:22.750
So we're dealing primarily with
forms of protest against,

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:27.134
or forms of resistance to,
circumstances which had a

00:09:27.134 --> 00:09:31.692
detrimental effect upon the
household economies of the

00:09:31.692 --> 00:09:35.220
inhabitants of particular
districts,

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.263
and those circumstances were
felt at one time or another all

00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:42.399
over England and Wales.
 

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:45.871
But there was also rather more
to it than that,

00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:50.250
although it took historians
quite a while to appreciate the

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:50.928
fact.
 

00:09:50.928 --> 00:09:55.046
When people first started
looking closely at the records

00:09:55.046 --> 00:09:58.190
which survive relating to these
events,

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.490
the most immediately striking
thing about the evidence was

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.456
that these risings,
revolts, or riots were in fact

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:12.746
relatively restrained and
relatively purposefully

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:14.070
directed.
 

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:18.299
Perhaps we'd been misled by the
very term "riot,"

00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:21.874
which was often used to
describe them in the legal

00:10:21.874 --> 00:10:22.750
records.
 

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:28.152
That word of course conjures up
an image of lurid breakdown of

00:10:28.152 --> 00:10:31.296
order,
but in fact in English law a

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:36.072
riot was simply an unlawful act
committed by three or more

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:39.759
people who had assembled for the
purpose.

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:42.594
As a result,
the reality of those events

00:10:42.594 --> 00:10:46.227
which are described
conventionally as 'riots' could

00:10:46.227 --> 00:10:50.589
be much less harrowing than the
image which the term tends to

00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:52.769
conjure up in our minds.
 

00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:56.658
So, take food riots for example.
 

00:10:56.658 --> 00:10:59.501
First of all,
they were by no means an

00:10:59.501 --> 00:11:03.265
automatic response to the
existence of a dearth or

00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:04.879
scarcity of food.
 

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:11.110
They were in fact relatively
few even in pretty bad years.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.149
Their form was also relatively
restrained.

00:11:14.149 --> 00:11:18.900
Crowds didn't simply seize food
from anyone who had a stock of

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:22.464
food to be seized;
the gentry or big farmers with

00:11:22.464 --> 00:11:24.668
well-stocked barns,
for example.

00:11:24.668 --> 00:11:28.532
In fact, food riots were almost
exclusively directed at

00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:30.750
middlemen in the grain trade.
 

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.678
They were almost entirely
directed against corn dealers.

00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:42.782
Again, crowds involved in these
riots rarely stole food and took

00:11:42.782 --> 00:11:43.908
it away.
 

00:11:43.908 --> 00:11:48.245
More likely they involved the
stopping of middlemen who were

00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:52.434
transporting grain which they
had bought up in bulk in the

00:11:52.434 --> 00:11:56.990
market and forcing them to sell
it to the crowd at prices below

00:11:56.990 --> 00:12:01.799
the inflated market rate;
that's to say at prices which

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:05.288
local people thought they could
afford.

00:12:05.288 --> 00:12:09.205
And finally they very rarely
involved violence against

00:12:09.205 --> 00:12:09.870
people.
 

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.750
Quite often food riots
involved, or were even led by,

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.326
women who could be quite
violent in their language and

00:12:17.326 --> 00:12:20.428
their threats but rarely
physically violent.

00:12:20.428 --> 00:12:24.269
The object was to prevent the
removal of grain,

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:28.518
to keep it in the area,
and to force those who had it

00:12:28.518 --> 00:12:33.726
to sell it to local people,
rather than to attack them

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:35.000
personally.
 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.719
So essentially it appears to be
the case that these were

00:12:39.719 --> 00:12:45.125
protests against dysfunctions in
the developing internal traffic

00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:46.668
in foodstuffs.
 

00:12:46.668 --> 00:12:48.971
Such a trade,
especially in grain,

00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:52.530
was essential to supply
England's growing cities and

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:56.578
those areas of the countryside
which are often described as

00:12:56.578 --> 00:13:00.626
'dependent areas' which didn't
produce enough grain for the

00:13:00.626 --> 00:13:02.928
local population's needs.
 

00:13:02.928 --> 00:13:07.111
But the system of internal
trade which was developing was

00:13:07.111 --> 00:13:11.219
not yet sufficiently well
developed to iron out regional

00:13:11.219 --> 00:13:15.625
inequalities in the supply of
foodstuffs which was available

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:19.576
in bad years,
and in addition that system

00:13:19.576 --> 00:13:24.580
offered opportunities or
temptations to evade the law.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:28.924
The law stated that the poor
should always be served first in

00:13:28.924 --> 00:13:32.029
the market,
at prices which were agreed by

00:13:32.029 --> 00:13:34.538
the market officers as
reasonable,

00:13:34.538 --> 00:13:39.456
before large-scale commercial
dealers were allowed to

00:13:39.456 --> 00:13:40.779
participate.
 

00:13:40.779 --> 00:13:42.700
Yet that law was frequently
flouted.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.399
In Hertfordshire for example to
the north of London,

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:49.306
in 1598 the local justices had
to deal with the major problem

00:13:49.306 --> 00:13:53.408
of large-scale dealers who were
supplying the London food market

00:13:53.408 --> 00:13:57.639
intercepting grain before it
ever came to the local markets,

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:01.465
buying it on the road and
removing it immediately to

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:02.139
London.
 

00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:05.985
Problems of that kind could
provoke a great deal of local

00:14:05.985 --> 00:14:06.879
resentment.
 

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:10.831
And this kind of situation
helps to explain the geography

00:14:10.831 --> 00:14:11.960
of food riots.
 

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:16.533
They tended to take place in or
near market towns in heavily

00:14:16.533 --> 00:14:20.798
populated areas with many
consumers dependent upon those

00:14:20.798 --> 00:14:21.730
markets.
 

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:25.682
They took place in or around
market towns of food-exporting

00:14:25.682 --> 00:14:29.361
areas where the local poor
witnessed commercial dealers

00:14:29.361 --> 00:14:33.519
buying up supplies at prices
which they couldn't afford,

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:36.178
in order to ship the grain
elsewhere.

00:14:36.178 --> 00:14:40.823
And they occurred in areas that
such dealers passed through on

00:14:40.823 --> 00:14:43.490
their way to major urban
markets.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.624
In particular,
one finds a lot of food rioting

00:14:46.624 --> 00:14:49.548
in the market catchment area of
London,

00:14:49.548 --> 00:14:52.570
in the southeast,
and in the southwest around the

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:56.841
great city of Bristol;
similarly to a lesser degree

00:14:56.841 --> 00:14:59.899
around Norwich in East Anglia.
 

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:05.881
So these actions were aimed at
rectifying quite specific forms

00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:09.615
of local grievance,
a sense amongst local

00:15:09.615 --> 00:15:14.190
populations that they were being
exploited by middlemen in the

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.139
grain trade and abused.
 

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:20.543
Where there was no such
grievance the poor seemed simply

00:15:20.543 --> 00:15:25.586
to have tightened their belts in
bad years or even in some parts

00:15:25.586 --> 00:15:29.908
of the north and far west to
have starved quietly.

00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:33.476
And those of them who did take
action usually did it in a

00:15:33.476 --> 00:15:36.985
fairly purposeful manner,
focusing on achieving a

00:15:36.985 --> 00:15:40.534
specific end--
supplying their own needs at

00:15:40.534 --> 00:15:43.220
prices that they could afford.
 

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:48.056
Defending, one could say in the
jargon, their 'exchange

00:15:48.056 --> 00:15:49.490
entitlements'.
 

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:53.003
Well, similarly,
agrarian disturbances present a

00:15:53.003 --> 00:15:57.039
less lurid picture than the one
conjured up by the word

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:58.610
"riot."
 

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:02.879
They certainly often involved
large crowds of people who had

00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:06.210
assembled together to prevent an
enclosure,

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:09.325
or to reverse it,
or to prevent the drainage of

00:16:09.325 --> 00:16:11.960
Fenland,
or to reverse it, and so forth;

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.817
knocking down hedges and
fences, blocking drainage works

00:16:15.817 --> 00:16:16.870
and so forth.
 

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.990
But they were also relatively
orderly.

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:25.808
Surprisingly often agrarian
riots were announced in advance.

00:16:25.808 --> 00:16:29.768
They were even sometimes
preceded by meetings in the

00:16:29.768 --> 00:16:33.960
local manor court or in the
church at which the tenants

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.600
would agree upon their action.
 

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.580
In one village for example
called Ryton,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.649
R-y-t-o-n, up in the northeast
of England,

00:16:42.649 --> 00:16:47.666
in 1607, the manor court
actually required all tenants to

00:16:47.666 --> 00:16:53.311
turn up with a spade or an ax in
order to take down an enclosure

00:16:53.311 --> 00:16:55.730
to which they objected.
 

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:59.952
They even laid it down in the
manor court, as a bylaw,

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:04.576
that any tenant who failed to
turn up to take part would be

00:17:04.576 --> 00:17:06.170
fined six pence.
 

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.137
Sometimes these actions were
initiated having been agreed

00:17:10.137 --> 00:17:13.964
upon by a public signal,
quite often the tolling of the

00:17:13.964 --> 00:17:15.170
church bells.
 

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:19.609
They frequently involved the
gathering of whole communities:

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.318
men, women, and children
together.

00:17:22.318 --> 00:17:25.788
Sometimes they were led by
local notables.

00:17:25.788 --> 00:17:28.838
Sometimes the minister of the
parish might be the leader.

00:17:28.838 --> 00:17:32.944
Sometimes they were led by
parish or manorial officers,

00:17:32.944 --> 00:17:35.529
or members of the manorial
jury.

00:17:35.529 --> 00:17:39.734
Sometimes they even enjoyed the
tacit support of sympathetic

00:17:39.734 --> 00:17:43.056
local gentlemen,
who might themselves be losing

00:17:43.056 --> 00:17:46.990
out from a particular enclosure
and were content to encourage

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.955
some action against it,
even though they rarely took

00:17:50.955 --> 00:17:52.288
part themselves.
 

00:17:52.288 --> 00:17:56.298
One of the reasons that Oliver
Cromwell was so popular in

00:17:56.298 --> 00:17:59.961
eastern England,
in the Fenlands that he came

00:17:59.961 --> 00:18:04.974
from, was the fact that in 1628
he had defended the rioters in

00:18:04.974 --> 00:18:09.906
the Fens in Parliament against
the innovations that they were

00:18:09.906 --> 00:18:11.880
protesting against.
 

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.317
He was known as the "Lord
of the Fens"

00:18:14.317 --> 00:18:16.028
for his popularity in the area.
 

00:18:16.028 --> 00:18:22.058
It didn't hurt when he later
recruited his regiments there.

00:18:22.058 --> 00:18:27.400
Riots often involved a strong
element of ritual.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:32.365
Frequently, they involved the
ritual removal of a fence or a

00:18:32.365 --> 00:18:33.038
hedge.
 

00:18:33.038 --> 00:18:37.657
Sometimes those who pulled down
fences or hedges did it two at a

00:18:37.657 --> 00:18:41.250
time to avoid the legal
definition of a riot as an

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.990
illegal act committed by three
or more persons.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.923
Sometimes the youth,
or the women of the community,

00:18:48.923 --> 00:18:53.250
were to the fore in this action
in order to evade severe

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:54.430
punishment.
 

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.660
It was thought that they would
be held less culpable.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.109
Sometimes hedges were pulled
down by men dressed as women,

00:19:02.109 --> 00:19:06.481
and this transvestite element
in the ritual of rioting is

00:19:06.481 --> 00:19:08.200
quite fascinating.
 

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.348
It perhaps symbolized a world
turned upside down.

00:19:12.348 --> 00:19:16.133
No one could have deceived
themselves that these were

00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:17.369
actually women.
 

00:19:17.369 --> 00:19:19.089
They had beards for a start.
 

00:19:19.089 --> 00:19:19.640
&gt;
 

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:24.498
But they dressed as women
sometimes, perhaps symbolizing a

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:26.798
world turned upside down.
 

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:30.835
Fences and hedges once they
were destroyed were sometimes

00:19:30.835 --> 00:19:34.150
sawn up and burned,
or even ritually buried.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:39.307
Sometimes the land returned
into tillage was ritually plowed

00:19:39.307 --> 00:19:43.940
to symbolize its return to the
manorial community,

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.969
or sometimes where it was
common pasture which was being

00:19:46.969 --> 00:19:50.001
defended,
animals were put back onto it

00:19:50.001 --> 00:19:54.746
by the villagers in order to
symbolize their reclamation of

00:19:54.746 --> 00:19:56.710
their common pasture.
 

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.707
And quite often all of this
might be accompanied by a rather

00:20:00.707 --> 00:20:02.130
festive atmosphere.
 

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.679
Cakes and ale were frequently
prepared to be enjoyed

00:20:06.679 --> 00:20:09.980
afterwards, often around a
bonfire.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.809
Music sometimes accompanied the
proceeding.

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:14.618
There might be dancing.
 

00:20:14.618 --> 00:20:18.412
In the Fenlands they enjoyed a
game which was known as

00:20:18.412 --> 00:20:20.630
"Fenland football."
 

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.924
This was the original form of
football in which large crowds

00:20:23.924 --> 00:20:27.054
of young men simply chased
across the countryside kicking

00:20:27.054 --> 00:20:28.730
an inflated pig's bladder.
 

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.890
In the Fenland when they got
together for Fenland football,

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:35.326
they kicked it across the
countryside and destroyed every

00:20:35.326 --> 00:20:38.946
drainage ditch that they passed
in the course of chasing the

00:20:38.946 --> 00:20:39.500
ball.
 

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:45.114
It's interesting also that
these actions often took place

00:20:45.114 --> 00:20:47.220
upon festival days.
 

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.308
The rising in the Midlands in
1607 started on May Day.

00:20:52.308 --> 00:20:56.380
Shrove Tuesday in February was
often a popular date.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.509
It was a time known for village
games which involved rituals of

00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:04.038
inversion, turning the world
upside down for a day.

00:21:04.038 --> 00:21:07.400
Another popular occasion was
Rogation Day,

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.945
the day on which people
perambulated the boundaries of

00:21:09.945 --> 00:21:12.058
the parish to note the parish
boundaries,

00:21:12.058 --> 00:21:15.598
and that's something I'll
return to.

00:21:15.598 --> 00:21:20.853
And again, agrarian risings of
this kind very rarely involved

00:21:20.853 --> 00:21:23.130
violence against people.
 

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.038
The crowds might appear very
threatening.

00:21:25.038 --> 00:21:29.098
There were rarely any injuries
to individuals.

00:21:29.098 --> 00:21:35.808
Indeed, those against whom the
crowd were rioting or protesting

00:21:35.808 --> 00:21:39.380
very often kept out of the way.
 

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:45.292
So what we're dealing with are
occasions which were often very

00:21:45.292 --> 00:21:49.848
highly targeted and very
purposeful affairs,

00:21:49.848 --> 00:21:55.439
rather than outbreaks of
anarchy and unrestrained

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:56.720
violence.
 

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.663
It's equally evident that they
were expressive of a kind of

00:22:02.663 --> 00:22:05.909
moral order,
which involved not just defense

00:22:05.909 --> 00:22:08.390
of the material interests of the
community,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:13.570
important as that was,
but expressed also a set of

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:15.578
values: what E.P.
 

00:22:15.578 --> 00:22:19.481
Thompson in a famous phrase
described as the "moral

00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:23.314
economy of the crowd,"
by which he meant a popular

00:22:23.314 --> 00:22:27.287
consensus about the nature of
legitimate and illegitimate

00:22:27.287 --> 00:22:31.791
practices in economic life,
involving notions of the proper

00:22:31.791 --> 00:22:35.910
behavior expected from different
sections of the community,

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:42.522
and asserting notions of
certain popular rights in the

00:22:42.522 --> 00:22:44.769
economic sphere.
 

00:22:44.769 --> 00:22:50.017
Rioters do indeed very often
seem to have been infused with a

00:22:50.017 --> 00:22:54.038
strong sense of the rectitude of
their acts.

00:22:54.038 --> 00:23:01.058
They were sustained in that by
certain legitimizing ideas.

00:23:01.058 --> 00:23:05.534
As one might expect,
in agrarian disturbances the

00:23:05.534 --> 00:23:09.730
vital legitimizing idea was that
of custom.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:12.598
As you know,
in any individual manor,

00:23:12.598 --> 00:23:17.847
custom constituted a kind of
local lived-in environment of

00:23:17.847 --> 00:23:21.548
norms and usages,
a collection of rights which

00:23:21.548 --> 00:23:25.666
people believed to have existed
"time out of mind to which

00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:28.654
the memory of no man is to the
contrary,"

00:23:28.654 --> 00:23:34.000
in the phrase they often used;
"time out of mind."

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.615
And to that extent custom
provided a powerful legitimating

00:23:38.615 --> 00:23:41.529
rhetoric for actions of this
kind.

00:23:41.529 --> 00:23:44.525
For example,
in 1630 when the tenants of one

00:23:44.525 --> 00:23:48.425
manor in the southwest of
England defended their claim to

00:23:48.425 --> 00:23:52.467
pasture rights in the forests
they were able to produce ten

00:23:52.467 --> 00:23:56.160
witnesses whose average age was
seventy-eight,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.650
quite extraordinarily old
people for this period,

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.733
who testified to the existence
of their customs in the

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:06.109
woodlands during their own long
lives and in those of their

00:24:06.109 --> 00:24:08.380
fathers and of their
grandfathers,

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.078
as they had been told when they
were children.

00:24:13.078 --> 00:24:16.624
But in the changing
circumstances of the sixteenth

00:24:16.624 --> 00:24:21.181
and early seventeenth centuries
custom had become not only a set

00:24:21.181 --> 00:24:25.160
of long-established rights and
practices but also,

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:30.199
in a time of change,
a potential arena of conflict

00:24:30.199 --> 00:24:33.490
between landlords and tenants.
 

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:37.471
If the tenants were trying to
defend what they took to be the

00:24:37.471 --> 00:24:41.453
antiquity and reasonableness of
customs which protected their

00:24:41.453 --> 00:24:45.240
interests,
many landlords were anxious to

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.983
explode those claims,
or to persuade people,

00:24:48.983 --> 00:24:53.881
or to pressurize people,
into removing customs which

00:24:53.881 --> 00:25:00.440
inhibited what they saw as
'improvement' of their estates.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.880
With that kind of conflict of
interests,

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.791
when push came to shove the
notion of the sanctity and

00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:13.169
wisdom of custom strengthened
the arm of those who tried to

00:25:13.169 --> 00:25:18.452
resist claims against local
customs which were detrimental

00:25:18.452 --> 00:25:20.769
to their interests.
 

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:24.526
In the case of enclosure,
they saw themselves also as

00:25:24.526 --> 00:25:28.932
resisting a kind of innovation
which had been declared illegal

00:25:28.932 --> 00:25:33.048
by various statutes throughout
the sixteenth century.

00:25:33.048 --> 00:25:36.858
The laws against enclosure in
fact were repealed in 1624,

00:25:36.858 --> 00:25:40.991
but the fact that enclosure had
for long been declared illegal

00:25:40.991 --> 00:25:45.530
by Parliament was remembered,
and that again gave a sense of

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:46.480
legitimacy.
 

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.950
And some rioters could even
claim a higher authority.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:55.287
As I mentioned,
very often enclosure riots took

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:57.548
place on Rogation Day.
 

00:25:57.548 --> 00:26:01.145
That was the day when
traditionally the older members

00:26:01.145 --> 00:26:04.881
of the village community
gathered together with some of

00:26:04.881 --> 00:26:08.522
the youngest members,
in particular young boys,

00:26:08.522 --> 00:26:11.400
to walk the boundaries of the
parish,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.190
to 'beat the bounds' as it was
called.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:19.521
The Church of England even had
a special homily for Rogation

00:26:19.521 --> 00:26:22.460
Day and it had some significant
texts.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:27.348
One of them was Deuteronomy
27:17: "cursed be he that

00:26:27.348 --> 00:26:30.778
removes his neighbor's
landmark."

00:26:30.778 --> 00:26:35.391
Another was Proverbs 22:28:
"remove not the ancient

00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:39.078
landmark which thy fathers have
set."

00:26:39.078 --> 00:26:42.969
The rituals of walking the
boundaries of the parish were

00:26:42.969 --> 00:26:46.577
all about such landmarks,
they were all about such

00:26:46.577 --> 00:26:49.632
boundaries,
such common territories and

00:26:49.632 --> 00:26:52.401
their sanctity,
and they tried to impress upon

00:26:52.401 --> 00:26:54.690
the young boys who were part of
the procession,

00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:56.720
where exactly the boundaries
were.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.868
There were various rituals
involved in this.

00:26:58.868 --> 00:27:01.967
If a boundary involved a
stream, then one of the boys

00:27:01.967 --> 00:27:05.900
might be thrown in the stream to
help him remember where it was.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:06.588
&gt;
 

00:27:06.588 --> 00:27:09.765
It was common if there were
boundary stones to get one of

00:27:09.765 --> 00:27:13.053
the boys to touch the stone with
his finger after which the

00:27:13.053 --> 00:27:16.511
finger was twisted by one of the
older men to give him a sharp

00:27:16.511 --> 00:27:17.930
pain to remind him.
 

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.837
One village practiced sitting
little boys on the stones with

00:27:21.837 --> 00:27:23.230
their bare bottoms.
 

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:27.298
They sometimes even struck a
child at particular boundary

00:27:27.298 --> 00:27:30.640
spots so that they would
remember the place.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.068
It was all part of the ritual.
 

00:27:34.068 --> 00:27:38.433
If such occasions sometimes
ended with purposeful attacks

00:27:38.433 --> 00:27:42.798
upon new-fangled boundaries
which had been erected in the

00:27:42.798 --> 00:27:47.317
form of enclosure and which
excluded local inhabitants from

00:27:47.317 --> 00:27:51.586
formerly common land,
then they may very well have

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:56.058
had a sense of divine approval
for what they did in defending

00:27:56.058 --> 00:27:57.548
their boundaries.
 

00:27:57.548 --> 00:28:01.623
As for food rioters,
they had a strong enough sense

00:28:01.623 --> 00:28:06.920
of their own right to have food
available at reasonable prices.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.242
When she was asked what had
motivated her to take part in

00:28:11.242 --> 00:28:14.640
the stopping of a grain shipment
in 1629,

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.778
one woman from Essex said it
was, to quote her,

00:28:18.778 --> 00:28:23.288
"the cry of the country
and my own want";

00:28:23.288 --> 00:28:27.509
"the cry of the country
and my own want."

00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:31.377
Grain rioters could also claim,
with some justification,

00:28:31.377 --> 00:28:33.700
to be merely enforcing the law.
 

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.902
They could see themselves as
engaging in a kind of mass

00:28:37.902 --> 00:28:41.872
citizen's arrest of grain
dealers who were breaching

00:28:41.872 --> 00:28:45.882
market regulations,
or they could see themselves as

00:28:45.882 --> 00:28:49.683
enforcing the regulations
supposed to be put into effect

00:28:49.683 --> 00:28:53.761
in times of scarcity which the
local magistrates should have

00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:54.730
enforced.
 

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:59.651
And frequently grain riots
broke out where the magistrates

00:28:59.651 --> 00:29:01.808
had been slow to do so.
 

00:29:01.808 --> 00:29:08.073
So then, rioting crowds had an
empowering sense of the

00:29:08.073 --> 00:29:11.500
rectitude of their actions.
 

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:16.458
But of course they weren't
simply disinterested upholders

00:29:16.458 --> 00:29:18.230
of custom and law.
 

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:22.635
They were also defending their
own interests,

00:29:22.635 --> 00:29:28.845
and in that endeavor riot was a
tactic in a kind of negotiation

00:29:28.845 --> 00:29:31.548
with local authorities.
 

00:29:31.548 --> 00:29:36.730
Very often food riots were
preceded by petitioning;

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.654
petitioning the local
magistrates to act to relieve

00:29:40.654 --> 00:29:45.210
distress and to put into
operation scarcity regulations.

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.130
It was commonly the case,
as I've already observed,

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.622
that such riots came after
weeks of deteriorating

00:29:52.622 --> 00:29:58.329
circumstances during which the
local magistrates had been slow

00:29:58.329 --> 00:29:59.358
to act.
 

00:29:59.358 --> 00:30:05.057
Hence, you could see riots as
being in some sense a kind of

00:30:05.057 --> 00:30:09.970
"petitioning in strength
and in deed."

00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:16.810
Agrarian riots were often in a
similar way a particular stage

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:21.598
in a process of dispute and
negotiation.

00:30:21.598 --> 00:30:24.249
That might include,
for example,

00:30:24.249 --> 00:30:29.036
initial appeals to people who
had set in motion enclosure

00:30:29.036 --> 00:30:32.368
schemes to desist and give them
up.

00:30:32.368 --> 00:30:34.509
The appeal might come from a
local minister.

00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:37.519
It might come from sympathetic
local gentlemen.

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:39.670
It might come from the women of
the parish.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.160
It might come from the manorial
jury.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.902
If that failed,
then there were a number of

00:30:45.902 --> 00:30:49.688
informal sanctions which could
be taken to try to put moral

00:30:49.688 --> 00:30:53.410
pressure upon those who were
engaged in an enclosure.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.980
So for example,
in 1616 in a village called

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.990
Over Compton,
which is in Dorset down in the

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:04.333
southwest,
a local enclosing landlord who

00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:09.203
was called Andrew Abington found
a paper stuck on the church door

00:31:09.203 --> 00:31:12.019
when he came to church one
Sunday.

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:15.904
The paper read,
"Here be Andrew Abington's

00:31:15.904 --> 00:31:18.862
Commandments,"
and it followed:

00:31:18.862 --> 00:31:21.650
"Thou shalt do no right.
 

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:26.789
Thou shalt catch what thou
canst.

00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:29.278
Thou shalt pay no man.
 

00:31:29.278 --> 00:31:32.970
Thou shalt bear false witness
against thy neighbors.

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:37.134
Thou shalt deny thine own
hand," that is deny

00:31:37.134 --> 00:31:38.578
responsibility.
 

00:31:38.578 --> 00:31:41.440
And shortly afterwards,
Andrew Abington's Commandments,

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.680
having embarrassed him at the
church door,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.517
had been set to music and were
being sung around the local ale

00:31:48.517 --> 00:31:51.608
houses as an effort to humiliate
him.

00:31:51.608 --> 00:31:54.900
Or again there could be
anonymous threats.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:58.344
One landlord in Warwickshire in
1607 received an anonymous

00:31:58.344 --> 00:32:01.969
letter threatening that action
would be taken if he proceeded

00:32:01.969 --> 00:32:05.722
with the enclosure,
and the letter was signed

00:32:05.722 --> 00:32:12.828
"Thomas Unhedgeall";
Thomas Unhedgeall.

00:32:12.828 --> 00:32:17.922
Another form of action
frequently taken was to initiate

00:32:17.922 --> 00:32:18.960
lawsuits.
 

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:22.096
Sometimes tenants would get
together and pool their

00:32:22.096 --> 00:32:24.920
resources in a common fund to
bring a case.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.788
At Neroche Forest in Somerset
in the west country,

00:32:27.788 --> 00:32:30.394
for example,
tenants anxious to defend the

00:32:30.394 --> 00:32:33.382
woodlands "put their purses
together,"

00:32:33.382 --> 00:32:35.626
as it was put,
on the advice of the

00:32:35.626 --> 00:32:38.170
sympathetic steward of another
local gentleman,

00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:42.140
who gave them that advice after
an open meeting,

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.893
and then with their common
purse they hired a lawyer to

00:32:45.893 --> 00:32:49.160
bring a case to try to prevent
the enclosure.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:55.218
When a riot came it was often
also a deliberate tactic to get

00:32:55.218 --> 00:33:00.470
the case heard in an
authoritative central court,

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:05.650
especially the Court of Star
Chamber meeting in Westminster.

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:08.880
The Court of Star Chamber,
as one of the highest courts in

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:11.800
the land,
was staffed with councillors

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:16.284
who were often reasonably
sympathetic to the interests of

00:33:16.284 --> 00:33:21.007
the local tenantry and who might
further their case or force

00:33:21.007 --> 00:33:25.890
arbitration in the interests of
preserving public order.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:29.684
A riot, which could provoke a
landlord to bring a case in Star

00:33:29.684 --> 00:33:32.740
Chamber,
was an excellent way of having

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:37.720
local grievances heard before an
authoritative forum and had the

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.462
additional advantage of getting
it done at the expense of the

00:33:42.462 --> 00:33:45.230
landlord who brought the case.
 

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:50.394
So there's a tactical element
in many enclosure riots and

00:33:50.394 --> 00:33:54.728
that's, of course,
an important reason for their

00:33:54.728 --> 00:33:56.848
relative restraint.
 

00:33:56.848 --> 00:34:00.999
They were a way of calling the
authorities' attention to

00:34:00.999 --> 00:34:04.935
grievances;
a way of putting pressure on

00:34:04.935 --> 00:34:10.849
the authorities to act and to
remedy these discontents.

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:14.329
And surprisingly often it
worked.

00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:17.936
Magistrates did put emergency
dearth regulations into

00:34:17.936 --> 00:34:20.920
operation in the aftermath of
food riots.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:26.586
Punishments of food riots were
usually relatively few and

00:34:26.586 --> 00:34:28.510
relatively light.
 

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:33.489
Or again Star Chamber or other
central courts quite frequently

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:38.143
ordered the settlement of
particular disputes by a process

00:34:38.143 --> 00:34:42.880
of arbitration and sometimes
indeed they even found for the

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:46.800
tenants and forbade the planned
enclosure.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:51.835
But, if action on the part of
local people was not restrained

00:34:51.835 --> 00:34:55.949
in that way it could be a very
different story.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:35:00.572
At Maldon on the coast of Essex
in 1629 for example,

00:35:00.572 --> 00:35:03.110
there were two food riots.
 

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:07.690
The first of them ended in the
authorities taking action to put

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:12.199
scarcity regulations into effect
and punishing very few people

00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:14.860
and punishing them only lightly.
 

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.454
When a second riot took place,
the authorities lost their

00:35:18.454 --> 00:35:19.159
patience.
 

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:23.427
A special commission was sent
down from Westminster which

00:35:23.427 --> 00:35:27.313
tried those involved as
ringleaders in the riots and

00:35:27.313 --> 00:35:31.012
hanged four of them,
including the leader of the

00:35:31.012 --> 00:35:34.226
Maldon riots,
Ann Carter, who was known to

00:35:34.226 --> 00:35:36.760
her followers as 'Captain Ann'.
 

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.014
Or again in the Midlands in
1607 the spread of rioting

00:35:41.014 --> 00:35:46.074
against enclosure from parish to
parish was eventually deemed by

00:35:46.074 --> 00:35:50.570
the authorities to be so
threatening that they defined it

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.059
as treasonable rebellion.
 

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:58.190
Martial law was declared and
the rising was put down with

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:02.762
another crop of executions,
including the execution of the

00:36:02.762 --> 00:36:04.360
leader,
John Reynolds,

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.590
known to his followers as
'Captain Pouch'.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:11.367
He got that name because he had
a leather pouch in which he

00:36:11.367 --> 00:36:15.469
claimed to have authority from
the king to oppose enclosures.

00:36:15.469 --> 00:36:19.730
When he was taken,
it was found that his pouch

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:23.989
contained his lunch,
some bread and cheese.

00:36:23.989 --> 00:36:27.371
Interestingly,
in the new Oxford Dictionary

00:36:27.371 --> 00:36:32.184
of National Biography you'll
find both Ann Carter and Captain

00:36:32.184 --> 00:36:36.920
Pouch included amongst the
dignitaries of national history.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:42.094
The--our sense of the past has
broadened wide enough to include

00:36:42.094 --> 00:36:46.099
people who previously would have
had no place.

00:36:46.099 --> 00:36:49.817
Well, that kind of outcome,
if things were deemed to have

00:36:49.817 --> 00:36:53.235
gone too far,
could very sharply remind the

00:36:53.235 --> 00:36:57.213
common people only too
graphically of who ruled in

00:36:57.213 --> 00:37:00.949
sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century England.

00:37:00.949 --> 00:37:06.353
And that kind of flat
repression of discontent was

00:37:06.353 --> 00:37:12.639
usually a sign that the
authorities had become nervous.

00:37:12.639 --> 00:37:16.699
And it raises a further point.
 

00:37:16.699 --> 00:37:20.882
The usual focus in the
literature upon the relative

00:37:20.882 --> 00:37:25.483
order and the rationality and
the tactical good sense of

00:37:25.483 --> 00:37:29.219
popular protest,
and on the usual moderation of

00:37:29.219 --> 00:37:31.989
response on the part of the
authorities,

00:37:31.989 --> 00:37:33.619
all of this is true.
 

00:37:33.619 --> 00:37:37.434
And yet it runs the risk of
making it all seem a little bit

00:37:37.434 --> 00:37:39.869
too neat, a little bit too
orderly.

00:37:39.869 --> 00:37:44.126
I think we have to remember
also that there was a good deal

00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:46.769
of danger in all of this
activity;

00:37:46.769 --> 00:37:50.429
sometimes quite serious danger.
 

00:37:50.429 --> 00:37:55.521
One mustn't forget that the
participants in many of these

00:37:55.521 --> 00:38:00.340
actions were very anxious and
sometimes very angry.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:05.172
We mustn't forget that
sometimes what began as a

00:38:05.172 --> 00:38:09.492
specific, localized,
limited, protest could

00:38:09.492 --> 00:38:10.829
escalate.
 

00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:14.349
The outstanding example is
Kett's Rebellion in 1549,

00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:19.467
which began as an enclosure
riot and ended of course with

00:38:19.467 --> 00:38:23.579
open rebellion and indeed a
pitched battle.

00:38:23.579 --> 00:38:26.380
That was very exceptional.
 

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:31.469
Nonetheless,
that possibility did exist.

00:38:31.469 --> 00:38:36.918
The point is that as a tactic
of protest and as a tactic of

00:38:36.918 --> 00:38:41.240
negotiation with rulers,
riot could be a rather

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.530
dangerous game of brinkmanship.
 

00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:48.829
The authorities for their part
had to try to contain it.

00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:50.780
They were expected to respond.
 

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.876
They had to retain their
authority and their credibility

00:38:54.876 --> 00:38:57.929
by responding in the right kind
of way.

00:38:57.929 --> 00:39:03.070
The crowd for its part often
pushed and menaced,

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:09.306
but it had to avoid going too
far if it was not to provoke

00:39:09.306 --> 00:39:12.590
pretty severe retaliation.
 

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.648
Acts of insubordination had to
be tricked out with the

00:39:15.648 --> 00:39:18.420
appearance of ultimate deference
to authority.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:23.369
The responses of concession and
conciliation which the

00:39:23.369 --> 00:39:28.597
authorities made had to retain
the appearance of gracious

00:39:28.597 --> 00:39:32.239
magnanimity on the part of
rulers,

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:34.480
concerned rulers.
 

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.639
That was the best way to save
their face.

00:39:38.639 --> 00:39:42.784
It seems to be the case that
for the most part this delicate

00:39:42.784 --> 00:39:45.427
line was held,
which is, in a way,

00:39:45.427 --> 00:39:49.393
a tribute on the one hand to
the skill with which the

00:39:49.393 --> 00:39:53.739
leadership of the crowds
conducted their actions and,

00:39:53.739 --> 00:39:57.606
on the other hand,
the skill with which many of

00:39:57.606 --> 00:40:02.398
the magistrates tried to defuse
what were potentially very

00:40:02.398 --> 00:40:04.500
explosive situations.
 

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.527
But of course that doesn't
necessarily mean that the

00:40:07.527 --> 00:40:11.206
protestors were sincere in the
postures of deference which they

00:40:11.206 --> 00:40:14.530
might adopt in the face of
authority when they negotiated

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.746
with them,
and it certainly doesn't mean

00:40:17.746 --> 00:40:23.596
that popular protest was,
as some historians have argued,

00:40:23.596 --> 00:40:26.780
essentially un-political.
 

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:31.581
When people describe these
actions as un-political what

00:40:31.581 --> 00:40:36.739
they seem to mean is that they
involved no challenge to the

00:40:36.739 --> 00:40:41.654
authority of the state,
and that they were not

00:40:41.654 --> 00:40:47.713
indicative of any revolutionary
attempt to overthrow the

00:40:47.713 --> 00:40:50.800
established social order.
 

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.409
Well, of course they didn't!
 

00:40:54.409 --> 00:40:59.534
Even the most determined of
protestors had no alternative

00:40:59.534 --> 00:41:04.570
model of the social and
political order to appeal to.

00:41:04.570 --> 00:41:07.070
There are no conceptions of
equal rights.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:11.070
There are no conceptions of
democracy.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.976
They had to work within the
structures of power and

00:41:13.976 --> 00:41:17.289
authority in a hierarchical
society as they found them.

00:41:17.289 --> 00:41:21.099
Their objectives were
necessarily limited.

00:41:21.099 --> 00:41:24.907
But that doesn't mean that
their objectives were not

00:41:24.907 --> 00:41:29.239
'political' in the sense that
they were attempting to exert

00:41:29.239 --> 00:41:32.750
some influence on how power was
exercised,

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:37.704
influence on how power was
exercised within their local

00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:38.989
communities.
 

00:41:38.989 --> 00:41:41.518
These forms of popular protest
one could say,

00:41:41.518 --> 00:41:45.887
in that sense,
were quintessentially political

00:41:45.887 --> 00:41:51.614
in the sense that they advanced
claims by local people to be

00:41:51.614 --> 00:41:55.309
considered;
that they advanced claims to

00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:58.682
certain rights--
to eat, to enjoy the

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:04.722
common--rights which they were
very aware of even in a social

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:10.360
system that permitted them no
formal political voice.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:15.728
They could still have some say
in defining the terms of their

00:42:15.728 --> 00:42:21.367
subordinate place in society and
they could achieve limited ends

00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:22.800
in doing so.
 

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:25.389
That matters a great deal.
 

00:42:25.389 --> 00:42:29.137
It matters a great deal because
it prevented their complete

00:42:29.137 --> 00:42:33.012
alienation from the existing
social order and encouraged them

00:42:33.012 --> 00:42:36.050
to seek justice where they felt
aggrieved,

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:41.657
rather than simply exacting
from time to time a desperate

00:42:41.657 --> 00:42:45.530
and bloody revenge--
and that mattered.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:52.081
It could matter a great deal in
particular when the country fell

00:42:52.081 --> 00:42:55.929
into political crisis in the
1640s.

00:42:55.929 --> 00:42:58.173
And finally,
one last point:

00:42:58.173 --> 00:43:03.659
the historians who write about
popular protest very often have,

00:43:03.659 --> 00:43:09.101
towards the end of their
studies, a somewhat elegiac

00:43:09.101 --> 00:43:09.849
tone.
 

00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:16.061
That's because in the long run
the defenders of the customary

00:43:16.061 --> 00:43:18.340
agrarian order lost.
 

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.949
They lost because the world
that they--that they were trying

00:43:22.949 --> 00:43:27.090
to defend was gradually
dissolving all around them.

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:29.800
By the late seventeenth and
early eighteenth centuries,

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:34.306
the resistance of manorial
communities to agrarian change

00:43:34.306 --> 00:43:37.963
was very largely over,
because such manorial

00:43:37.963 --> 00:43:40.780
communities hardly existed
anymore.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:44.871
Communities of tenants with a
collective interest in the

00:43:44.871 --> 00:43:48.887
customs of the manor had
gradually given way to a rural

00:43:48.887 --> 00:43:54.458
society consisting of landlords,
large-scale commercial farmers,

00:43:54.458 --> 00:43:59.550
and landless agricultural
laborers who possessed very few

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.369
rights to defend.
 

00:44:01.369 --> 00:44:05.103
But, if that was the case,
the tradition of protest

00:44:05.103 --> 00:44:09.659
established in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries did not

00:44:09.659 --> 00:44:10.929
entirely die.
 

00:44:10.929 --> 00:44:13.389
Grain riots certainly continued.
 

00:44:13.389 --> 00:44:18.059
They faded out only in the
nineteenth century when greater

00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:22.809
agricultural productivity and
modern railway transportation

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:27.070
finally ironed out and
alleviated the inequalities of

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:31.739
supply which had once provoked
those local actions.

00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:35.021
And as for the defense of
custom one could say,

00:44:35.021 --> 00:44:39.014
I think, that aspects of it
were transferred into another

00:44:39.014 --> 00:44:39.800
sphere.
 

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.643
Custom might be in retreat in
rural England,

00:44:43.643 --> 00:44:48.827
but in the emerging world of
industrial England a new world

00:44:48.827 --> 00:44:51.420
of custom was being born.
 

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.279
It was being born amongst the
skilled journeyman workers of

00:44:55.279 --> 00:44:58.360
the urban trades,
amongst rural weavers,

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:02.210
amongst coal miners,
and seamen in the growing

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.469
merchant navy.
 

00:45:03.469 --> 00:45:07.996
In all of these spheres new
customs, the customs of the

00:45:07.996 --> 00:45:10.679
trade, were being established.
 

00:45:10.679 --> 00:45:13.860
And they involved,
rather like the older agrarian

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.416
customs,
certain established

00:45:16.416 --> 00:45:21.608
expectations and practices:
expectations regarding fair

00:45:21.608 --> 00:45:24.628
wages,
decent working conditions,

00:45:24.628 --> 00:45:29.378
the proper relationship which
should exist between master and

00:45:29.378 --> 00:45:30.329
employee.
 

00:45:30.329 --> 00:45:32.965
These people,
increasingly numerous in the

00:45:32.965 --> 00:45:35.731
seventeenth century,
were the products of an

00:45:35.731 --> 00:45:38.239
emergent capitalist market
economy.

00:45:38.239 --> 00:45:39.650
They were its children.
 

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:42.289
They didn't oppose it as such.
 

00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:46.927
But they tried to place their
own limitations on the demands

00:45:46.927 --> 00:45:50.909
which it made upon them,
as best they could,

00:45:50.909 --> 00:45:55.710
defending their own place
within its structures.

00:45:55.710 --> 00:45:59.646
I'm speaking of course of the
emergence of the earliest forms

00:45:59.646 --> 00:46:03.320
of labor organization which you
find emerging amongst the

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.798
journeymen and manufacturing
workers of the industrial

00:46:06.798 --> 00:46:10.079
districts from the late
seventeenth century.

00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:13.739
The context had changed,
but the essence of the

00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:18.514
tradition could be said to have
continued in new ways for new

00:46:18.514 --> 00:46:19.309
times.
 

00:46:19.309 --> 00:46:25.206
The age of the manor was
ending, but the age of organized

00:46:25.206 --> 00:46:28.050
labor was just beginning.
 

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:33.000

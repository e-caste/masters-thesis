00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.450
Prof: So I got an
interesting email this weekend

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.940
from two of your buddies,
Jerry Wang and Emma Alexander.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:20.830
The title of the email is this.
 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.147
It says Casaplanka,
so I already know these guys

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:28.410
are up to no good.
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.830
And the question is the
following.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.624
They said, "You've written
a wave function ψ(x) and

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:37.000
A(p).
 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.077
There seems to be no reference
of time, so where is time in

00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:44.100
this," and they couldn't
stop there.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.070
That would be a good place to
stop but they went on to say,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.637
"Are you saying the ψ
is just a ψ

00:00:50.637 --> 00:00:52.540
as time goes by?"
 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.110
So that's the kind of stuff
that appeals to me,

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.060
so I don't care if you don't
learn any quantum mechanics,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.590
but if you can do this kind of
stuff I'm not worried about you.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.796
But now I have to give a
serious answer to that serious

00:01:05.796 --> 00:01:08.186
question,
which I sort of mentioned

00:01:08.186 --> 00:01:12.144
before, which is that everything
I've done so far is for one

00:01:12.144 --> 00:01:13.420
instant in time.
 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.340
I hope I made it very clear.
 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.000
So here's the analogy.
 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.232
If someone comes to you and
says, "Tell me all about

00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:20.110
Newtonian mechanics.
 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.840
How does it work?
 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.360
What's the scheme like?"
 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.849
You say, "At any instant
someone has to give you the x

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.494
and p of that particle at that
time," and that's all you

00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:32.810
need to know.
 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.849
That's all you can ask and
that's all you need to know.

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.699
Everything about that one
particle is completely given by

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:39.730
this x and p.
 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.060
That is called a state.
 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.789
That's the complete description
of any system is called at

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.992
state,
and a state in classical

00:01:47.992 --> 00:01:52.427
mechanics for one particle in
one dimension is just a pair of

00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:53.239
numbers.
 

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:57.614
It's a state because given that
I can predict the future for

00:01:57.614 --> 00:01:58.060
you.
 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.596
I can predict the future
because if I knew the initial

00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:04.000
momentum, namely initial
velocity.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.292
I know how fast the guy is
moving, and I know where it is

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:08.408
at the initial x.
 

00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:12.370
A tiny amount of time later
it'll be at x vt,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.348
but t is very small.
 

00:02:14.348 --> 00:02:18.449
Then since I know the
acceleration from Newton's Laws,

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:20.438
which is rate of change of
velocity,

00:02:20.438 --> 00:02:24.311
if I knew the initial velocity
or initial momentum I can get

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.280
the momentum a little later.
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.840
Then in that manner I can inch
forward in time.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.902
So you need Newton's Laws,
and Newton's Laws tell you,

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:36.045
if you like,
rate of change of momentum is

00:02:36.045 --> 00:02:37.120
the force.
 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.241
So if you like you can write
this mdx/dt squared is the

00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:44.150
force.
 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.807
So this part is called dynamics
and this part is called

00:02:48.807 --> 00:02:49.930
kinematics.
 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.330
So dynamics is how do things
change with time?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.348
Kinematics is what do you need
to know about the particle?

00:02:56.348 --> 00:02:59.729
In the quantum version of this
if you say,

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:03.712
"What constitutes complete
knowledge of the

00:03:03.712 --> 00:03:07.358
particle?,"
the answer is this function

00:03:07.358 --> 00:03:08.460
ψ(x).
 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.675
If you knew this function you
know all that there is to know

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:12.819
about the particle.
 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.479
We're not saying it's real.
 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:18.330
It can be complex.
 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.052
Then you can ask,
"If you knew the ψ

00:03:21.052 --> 00:03:24.210
at one time what's it going to
be later on?"

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.169
That's the analog of this one.
 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:27.990
So I have not come to that yet.
 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.970
So this is a pretty long story.
 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.378
It takes so long just to tell
you what to do at one time.

00:03:36.378 --> 00:03:40.479
Then I'm going to tell you how
to go from now to later.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.263
In Newtonian mechanics it's
just a one-word answer,

00:03:44.263 --> 00:03:46.758
x and p now is the whole story.
 

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:50.729
So anyway, since we've got four
lectures including today I will,

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.572
of course, tell you before it's
all over what is the analog of

00:03:54.572 --> 00:03:55.139
this.
 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.949
Namely I'll tell you a formula
for dψ/dt.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.879
How does ψ change with time?
 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.658
So let's summarize what we know.
 

00:04:02.658 --> 00:04:06.516
I want to do this every class
so that it gets into your

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:07.158
system.
 

00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:10.599
If it is true that ψ(x)
tells me everything I need to

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.120
know let's ask questions of this
ψ.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.939
We can say, "Where is the
particle?"

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:18.110
So there is some ψ.
 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.666
You're told then the
probability that you will find

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:22.560
it somewhere is the absolute
value.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.290
Probability density is
proportional to ψ^(2).

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.810
So it doesn't tell you where
the particle is.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.389
It gives you the odds,
and the odds are this.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.519
Then you can say,
"Okay, x is just one of

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.129
the variables of interest to me.
 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.819
How about momentum?
 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.738
If I measure momentum what
answers will I get,

00:04:41.738 --> 00:04:45.370
and what are the odds for the
different answers?"

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.870
That question has a longer
answer and it goes as follows.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.670
Take the ψ
that's given to you,

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.415
and write is as a sum with some
coefficients of functions that I

00:04:58.415 --> 00:05:02.920
call ψ_p(x),
but I will tell you what they

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.319
are.
 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:11.500
They are e^(ipx/ℏ) by square
root of L.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.536
Then I said,
"If you manage to write

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:15.879
the ψ that's given to you in
this form,

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:18.699
summing over all the allowed
values of p,

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.466
then the probability that you
will get one of those allowed

00:05:24.466 --> 00:05:28.942
values is equal to the absolute
square of that

00:05:28.942 --> 00:05:31.129
coefficient."
 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.038
And then final question can be,
"How do I know what

00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:38.377
A(p) is given some
function ψ?,"

00:05:38.377 --> 00:05:42.571
and the answer is A(p)
is the integral of the complex

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:45.129
conjugate of this ψ(x) dx.
 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.050
In our case it was a ring of
length L.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.735
Then it's 0 to L,
otherwise it's whatever your

00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:51.769
allowed region is.
 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:52.600
Yep?
 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.964
Student:  Can you
explain ________ one more time

00:05:54.964 --> 00:05:55.360
what...
 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.810
Prof: What this guy
means?

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.440
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.939
Prof: So let me give an
example.

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:07.182
Suppose ψ
of p was cosine

00:06:07.182 --> 00:06:11.399
4Πx over L?
 

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:20.535
Then that looks like
e^(4Πix/L) e^(-4Πix/L)

00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:23.389
divided by 2.
 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:30.879
Let me put the 2 here,
put the 2 here.

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.488
Then my ψ
is not quite in the standard

00:06:33.488 --> 00:06:36.670
form because I don't have the
square root of Ls.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:42.637
So let me put a square root of
L here, a square root of L here

00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:45.279
and also put one outside.
 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:53.850
So my ψ looks like a square
root of L.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.069
Let me see.
 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:57.009
Oh, I know what the problem is.
 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:02.846
This ψ is not normalized
because the rule is if you

00:07:02.846 --> 00:07:04.857
don't--
first let's say it's not

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:07.026
normalized,
so don't worry about any of

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:07.920
these numbers.
 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.836
Can you see that it's made up
of two such functions with equal

00:07:13.836 --> 00:07:14.709
weight?
 

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:17.560
That means if you measure the
momentum you'll only get the

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.259
answer corresponding to what's
here and what's here.

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:26.567
If you compare it to
e^(ipx/ℏ) you can see the p

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:33.389
that goes here is really
4Πâ„ /L or -4Πâ„ /L.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:41.887
So a particle in this state can
have only two values of momentum

00:07:41.887 --> 00:07:46.639
if you measure it,
and the probability for the two

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.538
you can see by symmetry must be
50/50 for each because they come

00:07:50.538 --> 00:07:51.839
with equal weight.
 

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.029
But if you don't want to do
that you can,

00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:56.985
if you like, like this ψ,
normalize it,

00:07:56.985 --> 00:07:59.583
and then we square it,
integrate it and put a number

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:02.019
in front so it comes out to have
length 1.

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:05.209
Then the coefficients here
directly when squared will give

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:06.329
you probabilities.
 

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:06.980
Yes?
 

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.620
Oh, a lot of questions.
 

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.829
Yeah?
 

00:08:08.829 --> 00:08:13.413
Student:  So
A_p has to be a real

00:08:13.413 --> 00:08:14.910
number, right?
 

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.439
Prof: No.
 

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:18.949
A_p does not have to
be a real number just like

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:22.709
ψ(x) does not have to be a
real number A_p--

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:26.259
because I'm taking the absolute
value of A^(2).

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:29.586
So even if it's a complex
number the absolute value of A

00:08:29.586 --> 00:08:32.429
will always come out to be real
and positive.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:37.580
Is that your question?
 

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.120
See A_p is not a
probability.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.383
The absolute value squared of
A_p is a probability

00:08:43.383 --> 00:08:45.428
which, of course,
must be positive.

00:08:45.428 --> 00:08:49.041
But A does not have to be
positive, does not have to be

00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:49.509
real.
 

00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:50.798
Yeah?
 

00:08:50.798 --> 00:08:59.508
Student:  You said
A_p like the integral

00:08:59.508 --> 00:09:08.216
if you're multiplying ψ*
times ψ would that be in

00:09:08.216 --> 00:09:10.860
real numbers?
 

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.350
Prof: You should be very
careful.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.928
Student:  Really?
 

00:09:12.928 --> 00:09:17.182
Prof: A particular ψ
times that same ψ* is a

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:18.870
real positive number.
 

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.528
This is not the same function.
 

00:09:20.528 --> 00:09:23.424
I think I remember now from
previous years that students

00:09:23.424 --> 00:09:24.899
will get confused on this.
 

00:09:24.899 --> 00:09:29.845
This ψ(x) is the function
that was given to me of which it

00:09:29.845 --> 00:09:32.102
was asked,
"If I measure momentum

00:09:32.102 --> 00:09:33.440
what answer will I get?"
 

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.500
This ψ_p is not
the function that was given to

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.759
me.
 

00:09:36.759 --> 00:09:39.981
This is another function that
describes a particle whose

00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:40.918
momentum is p.
 

00:09:40.918 --> 00:09:44.777
So you've got to multiply that
function with the given function

00:09:44.777 --> 00:09:46.519
to get these coefficients.
 

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:48.515
So you can change your mind and
say, "Oh,

00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:50.070
I'm not interested in that
ψ.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.110
I want to know the answer to
that ψ."

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.850
Well, you take that ψ
and put it here.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.289
These guys will not change.
 

00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:57.259
Yeah?
 

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:58.649
Student:  I'm sort of
confused.

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:01.854
Right next to what you were
explaining you have written

00:10:01.854 --> 00:10:03.159
ψ of p.
 

00:10:03.159 --> 00:10:04.039
Prof: Oh, I'm sorry.
 

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:05.048
No, no, no.
 

00:10:05.048 --> 00:10:06.529
You have every right to be
confused.

00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:07.460
I did not mean that.
 

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.830
This is ψ of x.
 

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.423
Student:  And is that
just ψ of x or that

00:10:12.423 --> 00:10:13.590
a ψ_p also?
 

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:14.710
Prof: Here?
 

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.379
Student:  That's just
the ψ of x...

00:10:16.379 --> 00:10:17.293
Prof: Yes,
this is ψ

00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:17.779
of x.
 

00:10:17.779 --> 00:10:18.740
Student:  Okay.
 

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.658
Prof: This
ψ(x)--well,

00:10:20.658 --> 00:10:23.600
if I'm more disciplined,
I can do that for you.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.860
Maybe I should do it one more
time.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.350
It doesn't hurt.
 

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:34.129
So let's so let's say ψ(x)
is cosine 4Πx/L.

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:38.304
Now first job is to rescale the
ψ so that if you square it

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.288
and integrate it you get 1.
 

00:10:40.288 --> 00:10:45.129
I know the answer to that is
square root of 2/L.

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:45.798
You can check that.
 

00:10:45.798 --> 00:10:49.135
If you take this guy and you
square it and integrate it it'll

00:10:49.135 --> 00:10:51.750
work because the square of this
will be 2/L,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.330
and the average value of cosign
squared is half.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.509
And we integrate it from 0 to L
it will cancel.

00:10:56.509 --> 00:10:57.798
You'll get 1.
 

00:10:57.798 --> 00:11:04.248
If you do this particular
function then all you have to do

00:11:04.248 --> 00:11:10.307
is write this in terms of--
first write this one,

00:11:10.307 --> 00:11:16.792
4Πix/L divided by 2
e^(-4Πix/L) divided by 2

00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:23.408
because exponential is cosine
θ is e iθ

00:11:23.408 --> 00:11:27.509
e to the -iθ
over 2.

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:35.990
Now I'm going to write this as
1/√2 times e^(4Πix/L)

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:42.350
divided by square root of L
e^(-4ΠIx/L).

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.879
Divided by square root of L.
 

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:49.159
I'm just manipulating the
function that was given to me.

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:51.019
Why do I like this form?
 

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:56.229
Because this is of the form I
wanted, A of p times ψ(p)

00:11:56.229 --> 00:12:00.629
where ψ(p) I this and that's
also ψ(p).

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:05.120
It's a normalized function
associated with momentum p.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:11.488
By comparing this you can see
that A is equal to 1 over square

00:12:11.488 --> 00:12:17.346
root of 2 for p = 4Πâ„ /L,
and A's also equal to

00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:21.179
1/√2 for p = -4Πâ„ /L.
 

00:12:21.179 --> 00:12:23.330
How do I know what p is?
 

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:27.740
States of definite momentum
look like e^(ipx/ℏ).

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:34.567
So whatever multiplies ix/ℏ
is the momentum that you can see

00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:36.360
it's 4Πâ„ .
 

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.029
You see what I'm saying?
 

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:41.200
If you want to put an ℏ down
here and put it on the top and

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.730
make the comparison.
 

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.840
So these are the only two
values for momentum.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.909
So this is a state which is
simultaneously in the state of

00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:55.379
momentum 4Πâ„ /L,
and -4Πâ„ /L.

00:12:55.379 --> 00:12:57.190
It has no definite momentum yet.
 

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:00.951
If you measure it then you can
get this answer with probability

00:13:00.951 --> 00:13:03.798
1 over root 2 squared,
which is 1 half,

00:13:03.798 --> 00:13:08.620
or you can get this answer 1
over root 2 squared which is 1

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.360
half and no probability for
anything else.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.220
You cannot get any other value.
 

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.279
See, normally when you take a
ψ(x),

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:21.248
a generic ψ(x) that I draw,
it typically has some non-zero

00:13:21.248 --> 00:13:24.070
value in all of space,
so you can find it anywhere.

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.442
But this guy has only two
values of p in the sum and only

00:13:27.442 --> 00:13:28.950
those will be possible.
 

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.240
Yeah?
 

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.130
Student:  ________
you're drawing ℏ over there

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:33.720
________.
 

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.669
Prof: This guy here?
 

00:13:34.669 --> 00:13:35.269
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:37.129
Prof: Yes,
I borrowed an ℏ,

00:13:37.129 --> 00:13:40.370
put it on top and bottom so you
can compare the expression.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:44.330
I'm just saying compare,
if you want without these ℏs,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.650
compare this expression to that
and you can see p is equal to

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:49.298
this.
 

00:13:49.298 --> 00:13:52.703
Now this problem was simple in
the sense that you didn't have

00:13:52.703 --> 00:13:55.761
to do that integral,
but last time before end of

00:13:55.761 --> 00:13:58.230
class I took the following
function,

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:05.538
ψ(x) =
e^(−α|x|).

00:14:05.538 --> 00:14:11.369
On a ring the function looked
like this, falling very rapidly

00:14:11.369 --> 00:14:16.809
and dying within a width roughly
Δx = 1/α.

00:14:16.809 --> 00:14:21.190
Beyond that it is gone.
 

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:25.441
Then if you square that and
normalize it in the circle you

00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:28.500
find this is the correct
normalization.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.833
In other words,
if you took this ψ

00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:33.798
and you square and integrate it
you'll get 1.

00:14:33.798 --> 00:14:37.563
If you're very,
very careful it is not strictly

00:14:37.563 --> 00:14:42.147
1 because this function the x
goes from −L/2 to L/2

00:14:42.147 --> 00:14:46.812
whereas in the integral I took
it to go from minus to plus

00:14:46.812 --> 00:14:48.038
infinity.
 

00:14:48.038 --> 00:14:50.629
That's because this function is
falling so rapidly.

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:53.649
The function is falling so
rapidly you don't care if you

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:55.788
cut if off at L/2 or go to
infinity,

00:14:55.788 --> 00:14:57.460
so I did that to simplify the
math,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.649
but the idea is the same.
 

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:05.645
Then if you want to know what's
the probability to get some

00:15:05.645 --> 00:15:11.642
number p you've got to take A of
p a square root of α

00:15:11.642 --> 00:15:17.948
times e^(ipx/â„ ) square root
of L times e^(−α|x|)

00:15:17.948 --> 00:15:18.879
dx.
 

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:20.298
You understand that?
 

00:15:20.298 --> 00:15:24.677
This is the ψ
with the root α

00:15:24.677 --> 00:15:25.600
in it.
 

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.169
That's my ψ.
 

00:15:27.169 --> 00:15:36.000
That's my ψ_p*(x).
 

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.743
If you come to me with a new
function tomorrow,

00:15:38.743 --> 00:15:41.129
I don't know,
maybe a function that looks

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:44.350
like this, a constant in some
region and 0 beyond.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.048
We'll put that function here
and do these integrals.

00:15:47.048 --> 00:15:49.570
You'll get a different set of A
of p's.

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:53.789
So for every function ψ(x)
that's a set of A_p's

00:15:53.789 --> 00:15:56.419
that you find by doing the
integral.

00:15:56.419 --> 00:15:57.639
Yeah?
 

00:15:57.639 --> 00:16:03.418
Student:  So if you
measure the momentum and you get

00:16:03.418 --> 00:16:08.298
one of those answers so it
becomes that answer?

00:16:08.298 --> 00:16:08.937
Prof: Right.
 

00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:09.908
So I'm coming to that point.
 

00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:13.178
So the second thing is another
postulate.

00:16:13.178 --> 00:16:15.678
In the end I'll give you the
list of postulates.

00:16:15.678 --> 00:16:20.198
And the postulate says that if
you measure the momentum you'll

00:16:20.198 --> 00:16:24.792
get only those values for which
the corresponding A_p

00:16:24.792 --> 00:16:27.625
is not 0,
and the ones for which it is

00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:30.831
not 0 the probability for
getting the number is the

00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:33.908
absolute value squared of that
A_p.

00:16:33.908 --> 00:16:38.865
And right after the measurement
the wave function will change

00:16:38.865 --> 00:16:43.325
from this sum over all kinds of
momenta to the one term

00:16:43.325 --> 00:16:46.960
corresponding to the one answer
you got.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.450
You understand that?
 

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.471
So in this simple example there
are only two values for

00:16:52.471 --> 00:16:53.870
p you can get.
 

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.840
No other values are possible.
 

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.110
They're all theoretically
allowed.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:59.380
For example,
6Πâ„ /L is a perfectly

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.817
allowed momentum in that ring
because it corresponds to a

00:17:02.817 --> 00:17:05.723
periodic function,
but that's not contained in

00:17:05.723 --> 00:17:07.440
this particular wave function.
 

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.141
This wave function is built out
of only two of them,

00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:15.460
namely 4Πâ„ /L and
-4Πâ„ /L.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:20.368
Once you measure it suppose you
got -4ℏ/L.

00:17:20.368 --> 00:17:23.510
The whole wave function,
which I had here in the simple

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.490
example, has got only two terms.
 

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.944
This part will simply
disappear, and the function

00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:33.380
after the measurement will be
this.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:36.068
The rough logic is that if I
measure momentum,

00:17:36.068 --> 00:17:38.978
and I got an answer,
that's got to mean something in

00:17:38.978 --> 00:17:42.400
any real sense that that is the
momentum of the particle,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.108
therefore it has to be true if
I immediately remeasure it.

00:17:46.108 --> 00:17:49.326
Immediately remeasure momentum,
and I want to get exactly the

00:17:49.326 --> 00:17:51.731
same answer,
that means the function after

00:17:51.731 --> 00:17:55.046
the first measurement should
contain only one momentum in its

00:17:55.046 --> 00:17:59.656
expansion,
so it'll reduce to that one

00:17:59.656 --> 00:18:00.509
term.
 

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:01.720
Yep?
 

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.006
Student:  Is there a
difference between ψ(x) and

00:18:04.006 --> 00:18:06.450
negative ψ(x) because it
seems like everything's just...

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.568
Prof: That is correct.
 

00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:13.490
I think I also explained the
other day that in quantum theory

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:19.213
ψ(x) and say 92i
times ψ(x) are treated as

00:18:19.213 --> 00:18:25.036
physically equivalent because
they contain the same relative

00:18:25.036 --> 00:18:27.009
probabilities.
 

00:18:27.009 --> 00:18:30.655
Of course if ψ(x) had been
properly normalized to 1 this

00:18:30.655 --> 00:18:32.818
guy would not be normalized to
1.

00:18:32.818 --> 00:18:35.606
It's as if you live in a world
where all you care about is the

00:18:35.606 --> 00:18:37.846
direction of the vector,
but not the length of the

00:18:37.846 --> 00:18:38.349
vector.
 

00:18:38.349 --> 00:18:39.930
We don't live in such a world.
 

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.474
If you say, "Where is Stop
&amp; Shop,"

00:18:41.474 --> 00:18:42.863
you say,
"Well, go in that

00:18:42.863 --> 00:18:45.068
direction,"
and you're not told how far,

00:18:45.068 --> 00:18:46.980
well, you're missing some
information.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.318
Imagine a world where all you
need to know is which way to go.

00:18:51.318 --> 00:18:53.304
In fact, maybe if you go to
some town and ask people where

00:18:53.304 --> 00:18:55.141
is something they'll say,
"Go in that

00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:57.509
direction,"
that's useful information.

00:18:57.509 --> 00:18:59.983
It's as if the direction is the
only thing that matters,

00:18:59.983 --> 00:19:01.380
not the length of the vector.
 

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.076
The analogous thing here is if
you multiply the function by any

00:19:05.076 --> 00:19:07.578
number you don't change the
information.

00:19:07.578 --> 00:19:10.440
They're all considered as the
same state.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.291
And I told you from this huge
family of functions all

00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:16.308
describing the same state I will
pick that function,

00:19:16.308 --> 00:19:23.640
that member whose square
integral happens to be 1.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.660
Yep?
 

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.050
Student:  So after the
wave function breaks down how

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.648
long do you have to wait for the
wave function to rematerialize,

00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:30.348
or does it...
 

00:19:30.348 --> 00:19:31.298
Prof: Oh,
it's not break down.

00:19:31.298 --> 00:19:42.450
It's another wave function
because e^(ipx/ℏ),

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.040
which is ψ(p),
this guy is as much a wave

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.960
function as any other ψ(x)
you write down.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.920
So these are not different
creatures.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.250
It's like saying the following.
 

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:54.980
I think the analogy may be
helpful to you.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.318
It may not be.
 

00:19:56.318 --> 00:19:59.337
ψ is like some vector in
three dimensions,

00:19:59.337 --> 00:20:02.759
and you know there are these
three unit vectors,

00:20:02.759 --> 00:20:06.795
i, j and
k, and you can write the

00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:09.839
vector as some
V_x times

00:20:09.839 --> 00:20:13.114
i V_y
times j

00:20:13.114 --> 00:20:16.160
V_z times
k where

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:20.042
V_y =
V⋅j

00:20:20.042 --> 00:20:21.490
etcetera.
 

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:24.894
Think of ψ
as a vector and each of these

00:20:24.894 --> 00:20:29.170
directions is corresponding to a
possible momentum,

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.076
and you want to expand that
vector in terms of these

00:20:31.076 --> 00:20:31.450
vectors.
 

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:34.650
This is ψ_p for
p = p_1.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.296
This is ψ_p for
p = p_2 and so

00:20:38.296 --> 00:20:38.598
on.
 

00:20:38.598 --> 00:20:41.255
So it's how much of the vector
is in each direction that

00:20:41.255 --> 00:20:43.573
determines the likelihood you'll
get that answer,

00:20:43.573 --> 00:20:45.068
that answer or that answer.
 

00:20:45.068 --> 00:20:47.882
But right after the
measurement, if you've caught it

00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:50.148
in this direction,
the entire vector,

00:20:50.148 --> 00:20:53.478
only the component of the
vector in the direction where

00:20:53.478 --> 00:20:55.390
you got your answer remains.
 

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:57.259
The rest of it gets chopped out.
 

00:20:57.259 --> 00:20:59.990
It's really like Polaroid
glasses.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:03.443
If you've got Polaroid glasses
light can come in polarized this

00:21:03.443 --> 00:21:06.681
way or polarized that way,
but once it goes through the

00:21:06.681 --> 00:21:10.271
glass it's polarized only in the
one direction corresponding to

00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:12.009
the way the polaroid works.
 

00:21:12.009 --> 00:21:15.255
If it filters light with the e
field going this way the light

00:21:15.255 --> 00:21:17.690
on the other side will have only
up and up.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:20.618
So measurement is like a
filtering process.

00:21:20.618 --> 00:21:26.067
It filters out of the sum over
many terms the one term which

00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:29.759
corresponds to the one answer
you got.

00:21:29.759 --> 00:21:33.381
So I don't mind telling this to
you any number of times,

00:21:33.381 --> 00:21:36.740
but that is the way that
quantum mechanics works.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:41.166
Similarly, if you're chosen to
measure position starting with

00:21:41.166 --> 00:21:44.199
this ψ,
and you found the guy here,

00:21:44.199 --> 00:21:46.820
once you found it--
see, before you found it the

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.838
odds may vary like this.
 

00:21:47.838 --> 00:21:50.622
Once you found it it's there,
and if you remeasure it

00:21:50.622 --> 00:21:53.029
infinitesimally later it'd
better be there.

00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:57.203
So the only function which has
the property is the big spike at

00:21:57.203 --> 00:21:58.818
wherever you found it.
 

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:02.440
That's called a collapsible of
the wave function.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.578
The real difference is the
following.

00:22:05.578 --> 00:22:08.082
I gave you an example of
somebody tracking me to see

00:22:08.082 --> 00:22:08.720
where I am.
 

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.476
I drew a probability graph,
and the probability graph may

00:22:13.476 --> 00:22:14.920
look like this.
 

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.025
And if you caught me here,
if someone says,

00:22:17.025 --> 00:22:19.078
"Where will I find him
next?"

00:22:19.078 --> 00:22:22.948
The answer is right there
because the probability has

00:22:22.948 --> 00:22:27.190
collapsed from being anywhere to
where we just saw him.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.921
The only difference between me
and the quantum particle is if

00:22:31.921 --> 00:22:34.759
you got me here I really was
here.

00:22:34.759 --> 00:22:37.769
You couldn't have gotten me
anywhere else at that right now.

00:22:37.769 --> 00:22:40.890
Can anybody find me anywhere
else except right now here?

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.338
You cannot.
 

00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:44.970
That's because my location's
being constantly measured.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:48.238
Photons are bouncing off to see
where I am, so my measurement is

00:22:48.238 --> 00:22:49.380
constantly measured.
 

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.603
A quantum particle with a
function like this,

00:22:52.603 --> 00:22:56.118
which is then found here,
was not really here.

00:22:56.118 --> 00:22:58.775
It was in this state of limbo
which has no analog in which it

00:22:58.775 --> 00:22:59.970
could have been anywhere.
 

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.528
It's the act of measuring it
that nailed it to there,

00:23:02.528 --> 00:23:05.384
but then right after that if
you measure it we expect it to

00:23:05.384 --> 00:23:06.318
be still there.
 

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:07.946
Now the time over which you can
do that is

00:23:07.946 --> 00:23:08.940
infinitesimal.
 

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.970
If you wait long enough the
wave function will change;

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.701
I will tell you the laws for
the dynamics that will tell you

00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:17.605
how it will change,
but we all believe that if a

00:23:17.605 --> 00:23:21.445
measurement is immediately
repeated for that same variable

00:23:21.445 --> 00:23:23.670
we should get the same answer.
 

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:27.695
Need not be,
it could have been even worse,

00:23:27.695 --> 00:23:30.858
but at least that much is true.
 

00:23:30.858 --> 00:23:34.230
So it's not going to get any
more familiar.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:37.680
It's a strange thing,
but hopefully you will know

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.190
what the rules are.
 

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.612
When I said no one understands
quantum mechanics what I meant

00:23:42.612 --> 00:23:45.180
was, of course,
by now you know the recipe.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.515
It doesn't mean you like it,
or it doesn't mean it looks

00:23:47.515 --> 00:23:48.788
like anything in daily life.
 

00:23:48.788 --> 00:23:51.703
Things in daily life they have
a location before you measure

00:23:51.703 --> 00:23:54.568
it, while you measure it and
right after you measure it.

00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:57.390
They're always in one place
doing one thing.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:01.722
Only in the quantum world they
can be in many places at the

00:24:01.722 --> 00:24:02.618
same time.
 

00:24:02.618 --> 00:24:05.067
But you should be very careful
if this is a wave function for

00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:05.640
an electron.
 

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.529
The charge of the electron is
not spread out.

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:09.019
I told you that.
 

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:12.650
An electron is one little guy
you'll only catch in one place.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:15.730
It's the wave function that's
spread out.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:19.038
Anyway, I think what'll happen
is you will have to do a lot of

00:24:19.038 --> 00:24:20.849
problems,
and you will have to talk to a

00:24:20.849 --> 00:24:23.192
lot of people,
and you have to read a lot of

00:24:23.192 --> 00:24:23.608
stuff.
 

00:24:23.608 --> 00:24:26.455
You can teach quantum mechanics
for a whole semester,

00:24:26.455 --> 00:24:28.700
sometimes I taught it for a
whole year.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.650
There's more and more stuff.
 

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.230
I want you at least to know how
it works.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.335
In real life when you go
forward I don't think you need

00:24:37.335 --> 00:24:38.140
all of this.
 

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.958
If you go into physics,
or something,

00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:41.877
or chemistry,
they'll teach you quantum

00:24:41.877 --> 00:24:43.949
mechanics again,
but I wanted people doing

00:24:43.949 --> 00:24:46.634
something else;
they are the people I want to

00:24:46.634 --> 00:24:47.700
send a message to.
 

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.220
Is here's a part of the world.
 

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.964
If you ever hear the word
quantum, where does the word

00:24:51.964 --> 00:24:53.259
quantization come from?
 

00:24:53.259 --> 00:24:55.259
What's the funny business in
the microscopic world?

00:24:55.259 --> 00:24:58.009
I want you to have a felling
for how that works.

00:24:58.009 --> 00:25:00.221
And I claim that the
mathematics you need is not very

00:25:00.221 --> 00:25:00.519
much.
 

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:05.288
You should know how to do
integrals, and you should know

00:25:05.288 --> 00:25:07.890
what e^(iθ) is.
 

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:11.805
So the postulates right now are
the state has given me a

00:25:11.805 --> 00:25:13.868
function ψ
of x.

00:25:13.868 --> 00:25:17.455
State of momentum,
definite momentum looks like

00:25:17.455 --> 00:25:20.565
this,
and if you want the odds for

00:25:20.565 --> 00:25:25.978
any particular momentum expand
it in this fashion which is the

00:25:25.978 --> 00:25:31.568
same as A of p
ψ_p of x,

00:25:31.568 --> 00:25:33.509
but A of p,
again, is that integral.

00:25:33.509 --> 00:25:35.670
I don't want to write it over.
 

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:37.980
Then if you measure p
you'll get one of the answers

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.413
with the probability given by
the square of the corresponding

00:25:40.413 --> 00:25:43.250
number,
and right after the measurement

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.068
the function collapses.
 

00:25:45.068 --> 00:25:48.180
So it always collapses to
whatever variable you measure.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:49.960
Yes, another question?
 

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.960
Student:  It looks like
the opposite.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.648
If you collapse it and you
measure x then what

00:25:55.648 --> 00:25:57.210
happens to p?
 

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:57.730
Prof: Very good.
 

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.588
His question was,
"If you collapse it to

00:26:00.588 --> 00:26:03.319
x what happens to
p?"

00:26:03.319 --> 00:26:03.940
I'm glad you asked.
 

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.039
I mean, that is the real
problem.

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:07.108
You had the same question?
 

00:26:07.108 --> 00:26:07.596
Student:  No.
 

00:26:07.596 --> 00:26:09.079
I was going to say well don't
you not know about p?

00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:09.750
Prof: That is correct.
 

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:13.430
So I will repeat what she said,
and I'll repeat what you said.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.758
I want to have this discussion
with you guys because it's very

00:26:16.758 --> 00:26:19.759
important because everyone's
thinking the same thing.

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:23.021
If I first take a generic
ψ, so I want everyone to

00:26:23.021 --> 00:26:26.900
know what the answer's going to
be to any of these questions.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.410
So I take this ψ
somebody prepared for me.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.138
Let's not worry about how that
person knew this is ψ,

00:26:32.138 --> 00:26:32.868
you're given.
 

00:26:32.868 --> 00:26:35.890
The electron is in this stage
ψ.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:39.132
If you measure x,
and you got x equal to

00:26:39.132 --> 00:26:42.680
this point the function,
of course, becomes a big spike.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.661
This spike in principle should
be infinitesimally thin,

00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:46.710
but I don't care.
 

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.970
Let this be the width of a
proton.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.693
If after that you say,
"What momentum will I

00:26:52.693 --> 00:26:55.420
get," well,
you know what you have to do.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.267
You've got to write spike
function equal to sum over these

00:26:59.267 --> 00:27:00.548
functions, right?
 

00:27:00.548 --> 00:27:02.925
You've got to take the integral
of the spike with this

00:27:02.925 --> 00:27:04.538
exponential and do that
integral,

00:27:04.538 --> 00:27:06.785
and you'll get a bunch of
numbers A of p for

00:27:06.785 --> 00:27:07.769
all values of p.
 

00:27:07.769 --> 00:27:11.965
And then if you measure
momentum, and you got the one

00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:15.920
corresponding to p =
6Πâ„ /L,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.709
the state which contains many,
many things will reduce to the

00:27:19.709 --> 00:27:23.308
one term corresponding to
p = 6Πâ„ /L.

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:26.817
If you plot that function it
will be some oscillatory

00:27:26.817 --> 00:27:27.558
function.
 

00:27:27.558 --> 00:27:31.266
The real part and imaginary
part will both oscillate with

00:27:31.266 --> 00:27:33.650
some wavelength given by
p.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.828
Be very careful.
 

00:27:34.828 --> 00:27:36.960
This is not the absolute value
of ψ.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.859
It's the real or imaginary part.
 

00:27:38.859 --> 00:27:40.450
They're both sines and cosines.
 

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:44.680
Absolute value will be flat.
 

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.058
So it'll go from a particle of
known location to a particle

00:27:48.058 --> 00:27:51.089
whose probability's completely
flat on the circle.

00:27:51.089 --> 00:27:52.220
You understand?
 

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:57.209
The wave function can look like
6Πi/L square root of

00:27:57.209 --> 00:28:00.400
L right after the
measurement.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.650
Let's call is ψ_6.
 

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.773
The absolute value of ψ
is a constant,

00:28:05.773 --> 00:28:08.821
but the real and imaginary
parts of ψ

00:28:08.821 --> 00:28:11.490
oscillate with some wavelength.
 

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.080
So right after the measurement
of momentum you don't know where

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.744
the guy is, and you say,
"Let me find this

00:28:17.744 --> 00:28:18.730
fellow."
 

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.865
You catch it somewhere then
it's a spike at that point,

00:28:21.865 --> 00:28:24.710
but then you have no guarantee
on the momentum.

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.748
So you can never produce for me
something of perfectly well

00:28:27.748 --> 00:28:30.838
defined position and momentum
because once you squeeze it in

00:28:30.838 --> 00:28:33.038
x it gets broad it in
p.

00:28:33.038 --> 00:28:36.029
Once you squeeze it in p
it gets broad in x.

00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:39.180
This is really mathematical
property of Fourier analysis,

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.589
that functions which are very
narrow in x when you do

00:28:41.589 --> 00:28:46.720
the Fourier expansion have many,
many wavelengths in them.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.493
And likewise,
a function with a very well

00:28:50.493 --> 00:28:54.364
defined wavelength,
because it's a complex

00:28:54.364 --> 00:28:58.798
exponential, has a magnitude
which is flat.

00:28:58.798 --> 00:29:03.410
So now I'm going to ask the
following question.

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.320
So when I did ψ(x)
the probability for x was

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.308
very easy, squared the ψ.
 

00:29:09.308 --> 00:29:11.048
When I said,
"Okay, I want to look at

00:29:11.048 --> 00:29:12.659
momentum,"
the answer was long and

00:29:12.659 --> 00:29:14.708
complicated,
namely, take these exponential

00:29:14.708 --> 00:29:15.963
functions,
write the ψ

00:29:15.963 --> 00:29:19.210
in terms of those,
find the coefficient, etcetera.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.358
Now I can say I want some other
variable I'm interested in.

00:29:23.358 --> 00:29:26.930
I want to know what happens if
I measure energy.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.220
Energy is a very,
very important variable.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.906
It's very, very important
because it turns out that if a

00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:37.460
particle starts out in a state
of definite energy,

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:42.509
I will show that to you later,
it remains in that state.

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:45.410
That's the only state that will
remain the way it is.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.438
If you start in a state of
definite momentum two seconds

00:29:48.438 --> 00:29:51.742
later it can have a different
momentum or it can be a mixture

00:29:51.742 --> 00:29:53.118
of different momenta.
 

00:29:53.118 --> 00:29:55.756
But if it starts in the state
of definite energy it will

00:29:55.756 --> 00:29:56.619
remain that way.
 

00:29:56.619 --> 00:29:57.420
That's not obvious.
 

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.930
I'm going to prove that to you
later.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.990
That's why it's very important.
 

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:03.465
So most atoms are in a state of
definite energy and they can

00:30:03.465 --> 00:30:06.241
stay that way forever,
but once in a while when

00:30:06.241 --> 00:30:09.497
they're tickled by something
they will either absorb light or

00:30:09.497 --> 00:30:10.799
they will emit light.
 

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:12.380
So we draw a picture like this.
 

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.535
We will see that the allowed
energies of the systems are some

00:30:15.535 --> 00:30:16.430
special values.
 

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.578
Not every value's allowed.
 

00:30:18.578 --> 00:30:22.761
And this can be called
n=1, n=2,

00:30:22.761 --> 00:30:24.900
n=3, etcetera.
 

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:26.885
And an atom,
for example,

00:30:26.885 --> 00:30:31.190
can sometimes jump from doing
that to doing that,

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.203
and in that process it will
emit an energy which is

00:30:35.203 --> 00:30:39.380
E(n=3) −
E(n=1).

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.736
That difference of energy will
come in the form of a photon and

00:30:43.736 --> 00:30:47.180
the energy of the photon is
â„ ω,

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:50.659
or if you like,
2Πâ„ f where f

00:30:50.659 --> 00:30:53.890
is what you and I call
frequency.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.328
And from the frequency you can
find the wavelength.

00:30:56.328 --> 00:31:00.625
The wavelength is just the
velocity of light divided by

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:01.578
frequency.
 

00:31:01.578 --> 00:31:04.866
So an atom will have only
certain allowed energies and

00:31:04.866 --> 00:31:08.711
when it jumps form one allowed
energy to another allowed energy

00:31:08.711 --> 00:31:11.380
it will emit a photon whose
frequency--

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.431
in fact, you should probably
call this frequency

00:31:14.431 --> 00:31:18.326
f_31 meaning
what I get when I jump from the

00:31:18.326 --> 00:31:19.818
level 3 to level 1.
 

00:31:19.818 --> 00:31:23.534
Similarly, if you shine light
on this atom it won't take any

00:31:23.534 --> 00:31:24.288
frequency.
 

00:31:24.288 --> 00:31:27.590
It'll only take those
frequencies that connect it from

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.519
one allowed energy to another
allowed energy.

00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:32.980
That's the fingerprint of the
atom.

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:36.950
Both emission and absorption
betray the atom.

00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:39.521
That's how we know what atoms
there are in this star,

00:31:39.521 --> 00:31:41.650
or that star,
or what the composition is.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:45.614
No one's gone to any of these
stars, but we know because of

00:31:45.614 --> 00:31:48.758
the light they emit,
and it's all controlled by

00:31:48.758 --> 00:31:49.509
energy.
 

00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:53.221
So the question I'm going to
ask is here's the function

00:31:53.221 --> 00:31:54.460
ψ(x).
 

00:31:54.460 --> 00:32:00.343
Someone gave it to me in some
context, and I say if I measure

00:32:00.343 --> 00:32:05.049
the energy of this particle what
are the answers,

00:32:05.049 --> 00:32:07.598
and what are the odds?
 

00:32:07.598 --> 00:32:10.160
So how do you think that will
play out?

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.980
You have to make a guess.
 

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.767
Suppose you're inventing
quantum mechanics and someone

00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:17.765
says, "What do you think is
going to be the deal with

00:32:17.765 --> 00:32:18.660
energy?"
 

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:23.759
You know what the scenario
might look like?

00:32:23.759 --> 00:32:24.720
You can take a guess.
 

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.732
I mean, as I told you many
times I don't expect you to

00:32:27.732 --> 00:32:31.201
invent quantum mechanics on the
fly, but you should be able to

00:32:31.201 --> 00:32:31.769
guess.
 

00:32:31.769 --> 00:32:36.470
What form do you think the
answer will take?

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.000
You want to guess?
 

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.349
Student:  ________
they'll be ________?

00:32:40.349 --> 00:32:42.923
Prof: Okay,
but if I want to know what

00:32:42.923 --> 00:32:47.858
energies I can get and with what
odds in analogy with momentum

00:32:47.858 --> 00:32:50.529
what do you think will happen?
 

00:32:50.529 --> 00:32:51.400
Yep?
 

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.450
Student:  Would you use
the formula p^(2)/2m?

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.650
Prof: He said use
p^(2)/2m.

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:57.818
That's a good answer.
 

00:32:57.818 --> 00:33:03.108
His answer was we know that the
energy is equal to 1 half m v

00:33:03.108 --> 00:33:06.988
squared which I can write as
p^(2)/2m,

00:33:06.988 --> 00:33:07.868
right?
 

00:33:07.868 --> 00:33:10.984
So you're saying if I measure
the momentum and I got a certain

00:33:10.984 --> 00:33:12.518
answer, well,
the energy's that

00:33:12.518 --> 00:33:13.538
p^(2)/2m.
 

00:33:13.538 --> 00:33:18.394
That's actually correct except
the energy of a particle is not

00:33:18.394 --> 00:33:21.019
always just the kinetic energy.
 

00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:23.430
For a free particle this is the
kinetic energy.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:28.018
For a particle moving in a
potential you know that you have

00:33:28.018 --> 00:33:29.680
to add V(x).
 

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.380
That is the total energy.
 

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.838
Now that's when we have a
problem.

00:33:37.838 --> 00:33:40.424
In classical mechanics once I
measure the x and

00:33:40.424 --> 00:33:43.547
p of the particle I don't
have to make another measurement

00:33:43.547 --> 00:33:44.230
of energy.
 

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.368
Do you understand that?
 

00:33:45.368 --> 00:33:49.210
I just plug the values I got
into this formula.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:51.328
For example,
particle connected to a spring

00:33:51.328 --> 00:33:53.246
V is
½kx^(2) where

00:33:53.246 --> 00:33:55.769
k is the force constant
of the spring,

00:33:55.769 --> 00:33:58.900
and the kinetic energy's always
p^(2)/2m.

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.980
Say if I measured p and
I got some number,

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.451
and measured x I got
some number, I can put that in

00:34:03.451 --> 00:34:04.970
the formula and get the energy.
 

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:07.950
You don't have to do another
energy measurement.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:09.943
And you don't have to do an
angular momentum measurement

00:34:09.943 --> 00:34:10.268
either.
 

00:34:10.268 --> 00:34:12.579
In higher dimensions angular
momentum is

00:34:12.579 --> 00:34:15.708
r x p,
and if you already measured the

00:34:15.708 --> 00:34:19.204
position and you measured the
momentum just take the cross

00:34:19.204 --> 00:34:19.940
product.
 

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.228
So in classical mechanics you
only need to measure x

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:24.079
and p.
 

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:27.349
In quantum mechanics he made a
pretty good guess that if you

00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:29.789
measured p,
the p^(2)/2m is the

00:34:29.789 --> 00:34:30.400
energy.
 

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.469
That is true if the particle is
not in a potential.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:38.641
But if the particle is in a
potential can you tell me how to

00:34:38.641 --> 00:34:41.400
compute p^(2)/2m 
V(x)?

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.713
You realize you cannot really
compute it because if you knew

00:34:44.713 --> 00:34:47.690
the p exactly you have no
idea where it is,

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.766
and if you knew the x exactly
you don't know what the momentum

00:34:50.766 --> 00:34:51.018
is.
 

00:34:51.018 --> 00:34:53.887
Maybe you know a little bit of
both, but still,

00:34:53.887 --> 00:34:56.320
how are you going to find the
energy?

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:01.670
So the answer is you have to do
a separate energy measurement.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.547
You cannot infer that from x
and p,

00:35:03.547 --> 00:35:05.974
because first of all you cannot
even get a pair of x and

00:35:05.974 --> 00:35:07.110
p at a given time.
 

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:08.829
I hope I convinced you.
 

00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:10.750
You measure this guy you screw
up that guy.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.969
Measure that one you mess up
this one.

00:35:12.969 --> 00:35:15.365
You can never get a state of
well defined x and

00:35:15.365 --> 00:35:16.179
p anyway.
 

00:35:16.179 --> 00:35:20.800
So the way to find energy is to
do a whole other calculation.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.226
So I will tell you what the
answer is, and hopefully you

00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:28.213
will realize it's not completely
different from the recipe we had

00:35:28.213 --> 00:35:28.900
before.
 

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:31.911
I'm going to give you a rule
for the functions which

00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:35.277
correspond to a state in which
the particle has a definite

00:35:35.277 --> 00:35:36.460
energy E.
 

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.518
Let's not worry about how you
get it, some function.

00:35:41.518 --> 00:35:45.961
You find all those functions,
or you're given all those

00:35:45.961 --> 00:35:50.570
functions, then can you imagine
what will happen next?

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:55.748
If I give you all those
functions what do you think the

00:35:55.748 --> 00:35:57.860
rule is going to be?
 

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:58.659
Yep?
 

00:35:58.659 --> 00:36:01.775
Student:  You separate
it into a sum of all the

00:36:01.775 --> 00:36:03.480
energies with coefficients.
 

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.369
Prof: Very good.
 

00:36:04.369 --> 00:36:05.460
Let me repeat what she said.
 

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.423
I hope at least some of you
were thinking about the same

00:36:08.423 --> 00:36:08.909
answer.
 

00:36:08.909 --> 00:36:12.179
Her answer is take the function
ψ,

00:36:12.179 --> 00:36:14.538
write it in terms of these
functions ψ

00:36:14.538 --> 00:36:18.103
E of x with some
coefficient A_E

00:36:18.103 --> 00:36:21.210
summing this over the allowed
values of E,

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.599
whatever they may be.
 

00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:27.644
And now that you said that what
do you think

00:36:27.644 --> 00:36:31.469
A_E is going to
be in a given case?

00:36:31.469 --> 00:36:32.550
Would you like to continue?
 

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:37.230
Student:  It's going to
be the integral or the wave

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.530
function ________________.
 

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:50.909
Prof: That's right.
 

00:36:50.909 --> 00:36:52.429
That is correct.
 

00:36:52.429 --> 00:36:54.813
The recipe's almost complete
except you don't know what these

00:36:54.813 --> 00:36:57.164
functions are,
but if you knew these functions

00:36:57.164 --> 00:36:59.268
you have to write the given
function,

00:36:59.268 --> 00:37:01.619
given wave function,
as a sum of these functions

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:03.320
with some suitable coefficients.
 

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.760
Coefficients are found by the
same rule,

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.708
and then the probability that
you'll find an energy E

00:37:09.708 --> 00:37:11.141
is,
again,

00:37:11.141 --> 00:37:20.943
A_E^(2). And
everything else will be also

00:37:20.943 --> 00:37:22.320
true.
 

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.143
Once you measure energy you've
got energy corresponding to

00:37:25.143 --> 00:37:27.471
E_1,
or E_2 or

00:37:27.471 --> 00:37:28.710
E_3.
 

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.331
Let's say you've got
E_3,

00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:31.400
the third possible value.
 

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:35.510
The whole wave function will
collapse from being a sum over

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:39.550
many things to just this one
guy, E_3.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:40.530
The collapse is the same.
 

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.530
The probability rule is the
same.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.172
The only thing you don't know
is who are these functions ψ

00:37:46.172 --> 00:37:47.010
of E?
 

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.260
You understand?
 

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:51.280
So, again, the analogy's the
following.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.469
There is a vector that we call
ψ.

00:37:55.469 --> 00:37:57.170
Sometimes you want to write it
in terms of

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.809
i, j,
and k.

00:37:59.809 --> 00:38:00.800
They are like the A(p).
 

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.137
Sometimes you may pick three
other mutually perpendicular

00:38:04.137 --> 00:38:06.880
vectors, i',
j' and k'.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.268
And if you know those
coefficients you'll get the

00:38:09.268 --> 00:38:11.159
probability for some other
variable.

00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:14.677
So you're expanding the same
function over and over in many

00:38:14.677 --> 00:38:18.619
possible ways depending on what
variable is of interest to you.

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:21.809
If it's momentum you expand it
in terms of exponential ipx of

00:38:21.809 --> 00:38:22.130
ℏ.
 

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:28.150
If it's energy you expand it in
terms of these functions.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.981
So the question is what is the
recipe going to be for these

00:38:31.981 --> 00:38:34.889
functions ψ_E of
x.

00:38:34.889 --> 00:38:38.219
By what means do I find them?
 

00:38:38.219 --> 00:38:40.684
Now you're getting more and
more and more recipes every day,

00:38:40.684 --> 00:38:42.230
but it's going to stop pretty
soon.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.500
This is about the last of the
recipes.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:48.795
Even this recipe I'll tell you
how to get from a master recipe,

00:38:48.795 --> 00:38:52.815
so it's not that many recipes,
but I have to reveal that to

00:38:52.815 --> 00:38:54.340
you one at a time.
 

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.255
Now you can say,
"Okay, what function do

00:38:57.255 --> 00:39:01.300
you want me to use for every
energy, what is this function?

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:07.722
After all, when it was momentum
you came right out and gave this

00:39:07.722 --> 00:39:08.639
answer.
 

00:39:08.639 --> 00:39:12.465
Why don't you do the same thing
here," and that's a problem

00:39:12.465 --> 00:39:12.889
here.
 

00:39:12.889 --> 00:39:15.628
The problem is the energy of a
particle depends on what

00:39:15.628 --> 00:39:18.672
potential it is in because it's
got a kinetic and a potential

00:39:18.672 --> 00:39:21.016
part,
so I cannot give you a

00:39:21.016 --> 00:39:25.190
universal answer for
ψ_E(x).

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:28.903
I will have to first ask you;
"Tell me the potential the

00:39:28.903 --> 00:39:30.320
particle is in."
 

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:33.619
Once I know the potential I
will give you the recipe.

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:37.148
Imagine the potential has been
given to me, for example,

00:39:37.148 --> 00:39:40.356
½kx^(2),
or it could be a particle in

00:39:40.356 --> 00:39:41.960
what's called a well.
 

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:45.260
You make a hole in the ground
or you build a little barrier.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.309
That's a possible potential.
 

00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:50.760
You can have a potential that
looks like harmonic isolator.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.059
That's a possible potential.
 

00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:57.239
You can have an electron and a
hydrogen atom -1/r.

00:39:57.239 --> 00:39:58.650
That's a possible potential.
 

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.195
There are many-potentials,
and the answer's going to vary

00:40:01.195 --> 00:40:01.969
on the problem.
 

00:40:01.969 --> 00:40:05.949
There's no universal answer for
the energy functions.

00:40:05.949 --> 00:40:08.791
You tell me what the electron's
doing, what field it is in,

00:40:08.791 --> 00:40:10.309
what field of force it is in.
 

00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:12.782
Then for each field of force,
or for each potential,

00:40:12.782 --> 00:40:14.190
there's a different answer.
 

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.860
And here is the master formula.
 

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.119
This is the great
Schr�dinger equation.

00:40:20.119 --> 00:40:22.230
So the answer looks like this.
 

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:26.360
The function ψ_E
obeys the following equation,

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:35.251
-â„ ^(2)/2m times
the second derivative of ψ

00:40:35.251 --> 00:40:41.666
V(x) times
ψ(x) is equal to

00:40:41.666 --> 00:40:46.769
E times ψ(x).
 

00:40:46.769 --> 00:40:47.849
Do not worry.
 

00:40:47.849 --> 00:40:49.929
I will see you through this
equation.

00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:52.166
Everything you need to know I
will tell you,

00:40:52.166 --> 00:40:55.130
but you should not be afraid of
what the equation says.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:58.199
It says those functions that
are allowed corresponding to

00:40:58.199 --> 00:41:01.378
definite energy will have the
property that if you took the

00:41:01.378 --> 00:41:04.199
second derivative,
multiplied it by this number,

00:41:04.199 --> 00:41:07.210
add it to that V(x)
times ψ_E you'll

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:08.340
get some function.
 

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:14.346
That function should be some
number times the very same

00:41:14.346 --> 00:41:15.570
function.
 

00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:18.552
If you can find me those
functions then you will find out

00:41:18.552 --> 00:41:21.161
when I will show you
mathematically that there are

00:41:21.161 --> 00:41:24.231
many solutions to the equation,
but they don't occur for every

00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:24.539
energy.
 

00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:27.757
Only some energies are allowed,
and the energies are usually

00:41:27.757 --> 00:41:29.719
labeled by some integer
n,

00:41:29.719 --> 00:41:31.619
and for every n,
1,2, 3,4,

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:33.905
you'll get a bunch of energies,
ψ_E1,

00:41:33.905 --> 00:41:35.688
ψ _E2,
ψ_E3,

00:41:35.688 --> 00:41:37.610
3, and you write those
functions down.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.530
Then you can do everything
thing I said.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.590
But the only thing is here you
have to do some hard work.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:46.244
Whereas for momentum I gave you
that and for a state of definite

00:41:46.244 --> 00:41:49.318
positions x = x_0
I told you spike at

00:41:49.318 --> 00:41:50.769
x_0.
 

00:41:50.769 --> 00:41:53.800
You didn't have to do much work.
 

00:41:53.800 --> 00:42:02.693
For this you have to solve an
equation before you an even

00:42:02.693 --> 00:42:08.730
start, but we'll see how to do
that.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:15.596
So the first problem I want to
solve is the problem where there

00:42:15.596 --> 00:42:17.590
is no potential.
 

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:21.900
That is called a free particle.
 

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.860
A free particle is one for
which V is 0.

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:31.753
And let me imagine it's living
on this line,

00:42:31.753 --> 00:42:39.449
the circle of length
2ΠR = L.

00:42:39.449 --> 00:42:41.985
Oh, by the way,
I should mention something

00:42:41.985 --> 00:42:42.420
else.
 

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:46.052
In terms of all the postulates
you notice I never mentioned the

00:42:46.052 --> 00:42:49.480
uncertainty principle today,
ΔxΔp should

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.929
be bigger than ℏ.
 

00:42:50.929 --> 00:42:54.130
I didn't mention it as a
postulate because once you tell

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.213
me ψ is given by wave
function and that states are

00:42:57.213 --> 00:43:00.530
definite momentum have definite
wavelength it follows from

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.905
mathematics that you cannot have
a function of well defined

00:43:03.905 --> 00:43:07.340
periodicity and wavelength also
localized in space.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.239
It's a mathematical consequence.
 

00:43:09.239 --> 00:43:12.980
Similarly, who told me that I
can expand every given ψ

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.079
as a sum over these functions?
 

00:43:15.079 --> 00:43:18.501
There's a very general
mathematical theorem that tells

00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:22.054
you in what situations you can
actually expand any given

00:43:22.054 --> 00:43:24.960
function in terms of a set of
functions,

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.295
namely are they like unit
vector i,

00:43:27.295 --> 00:43:28.719
j and k.?
 

00:43:28.719 --> 00:43:31.226
Suppose I had only i and
j and I don't have

00:43:31.226 --> 00:43:31.719
k.
 

00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:35.010
I cannot expand ever vector in
3D using i and j.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.724
So you've got to make sure
you've got enough basis

00:43:37.724 --> 00:43:40.936
functions and the theory tells
you that if you find all the

00:43:40.936 --> 00:43:43.929
solutions to that equation
together they can expand any

00:43:43.929 --> 00:43:44.760
function.
 

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.809
Similarly the rule for
expansion is also not arbitrary.

00:43:47.809 --> 00:43:48.679
It all comes from that.
 

00:43:48.679 --> 00:43:50.896
It's a very,
very beautiful theory of the

00:43:50.896 --> 00:43:53.059
mathematics behind quantum
mechanics.

00:43:53.059 --> 00:43:56.527
If you learn linear algebra one
day, or if you've already

00:43:56.527 --> 00:43:58.880
learned it, it's all linear
algebra.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:03.007
So every great discovery in
physics is accompanied by some

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:05.179
mathematical stuff you need.
 

00:44:05.179 --> 00:44:07.730
Like all of Newtonian mechanics
requires calculus.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.389
Without calculus you cannot do
Newtonian mechanics.

00:44:10.389 --> 00:44:14.764
Maxwell's theory for
electromagnetism requires vector

00:44:14.764 --> 00:44:15.690
calculus.
 

00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.710
Einstein's non-relativistic
theory doesn't require anything;

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.467
it's algebra,
but the general theory requires

00:44:21.467 --> 00:44:25.228
what's called tensor calculus,
and quantum mechanics requires

00:44:25.228 --> 00:44:26.420
linear algebra.
 

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.440
And string theory we don't know
what it requires.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:30.980
People are still discovering
new mathematics.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.440
But it's very true that very
often new mathematics is needed

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.610
to express the new laws of
physics.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.556
And if you don't know the laws
you may find out you're not able

00:44:39.556 --> 00:44:40.460
to write it down.
 

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:41.739
If you didn't know what a
gradient was,

00:44:41.739 --> 00:44:43.809
or if you did not know what a
curl is,

00:44:43.809 --> 00:44:47.876
and so on, then you cannot
write down the laws of

00:44:47.876 --> 00:44:50.250
electricity and magnetism.
 

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.199
So we have to solve this
equation,

00:44:53.199 --> 00:44:55.536
and I'm going to solve it for
the easiest problem in the

00:44:55.536 --> 00:44:57.889
world,
a particle moving on a ring of

00:44:57.889 --> 00:45:00.650
length L with no
potential energy.

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:02.679
So what does that equation look
like?

00:45:02.679 --> 00:45:12.773
It says -â„ ;/2m
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2) no

00:45:12.773 --> 00:45:24.280
potential = E times
ψ_E(x).

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:26.849
So let me rearrange the
equation so it looks like this,

00:45:26.849 --> 00:45:35.052
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2)
k^(2)ψ

00:45:35.052 --> 00:45:44.108
= 0 where k^(2) is
defined to be 2mE/ℏ^(2)

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:48.039
= k^(2).
 

00:45:48.039 --> 00:45:51.711
All I've done is just taken
everything to one side and

00:45:51.711 --> 00:45:55.315
multiplied everything by
2m/ℏ^(2) and called

00:45:55.315 --> 00:45:57.880
that combination as
k^(2).

00:45:57.880 --> 00:45:59.460
So who is this number k?
 

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.280
Let's see.
 

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:04.784
The energy is
ℏk^(2)/2m,

00:46:04.784 --> 00:46:08.059
but we also know energy's
p^(2)/2m.

00:46:08.059 --> 00:46:14.422
So this number k will
turn out to be just momentum

00:46:14.422 --> 00:46:17.150
divided by ℏ.
 

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:19.329
Well, momentum has not entered
the picture, but we will see.

00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:22.349
Let's solve this equation now.
 

00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:29.034
I say the solution to this
equation is ψ(x) = to

00:46:29.034 --> 00:46:34.795
any number A times
e^(ikx) any number

00:46:34.795 --> 00:46:38.829
B times e^(-ikx).
 

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:40.900
Let's see if that is true.
 

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:42.320
Take two derivatives of ψ.
 

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.849
What do you get?
 

00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:47.543
You understand every time I
take a derivative you pull down

00:46:47.543 --> 00:46:48.500
an ik?
 

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.594
If you pull it twice you'll
pull an ik squared which

00:46:51.594 --> 00:46:54.251
is -k^(2)ψ,
and the same thing will happen

00:46:54.251 --> 00:46:56.630
to this term that it'll pull
down a minus ik,

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:59.239
but if you do it twice you'll
again get −k^(2).

00:46:59.239 --> 00:47:02.864
So both of them will have the
property that the second

00:47:02.864 --> 00:47:05.257
derivative of ψ
will be equal to

00:47:05.257 --> 00:47:08.820
-k^(2)ψ,
and that is the equation you

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.849
want to solve.
 

00:47:09.849 --> 00:47:12.860
And A and B is
whatever you like.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:17.657
 A and B are not
fixed by the equation because

00:47:17.657 --> 00:47:22.538
for any choice of A and
any choice of B this'll

00:47:22.538 --> 00:47:23.269
work.
 

00:47:23.269 --> 00:47:26.349
So let me write it as follows.
 

00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:28.630
Ae to the i.
 

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:35.510
Let me write k,
k was a shorthand for

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:43.766
square root of 2mE/ℏ^(2)
x B to the -i

00:47:43.766 --> 00:47:49.268
square root of 2mE/ℏ^(2)
x.

00:47:49.268 --> 00:47:52.175
I'm trying to show you that
these are really functions of

00:47:52.175 --> 00:47:54.458
definite energy
ψ_E and here is

00:47:54.458 --> 00:47:55.860
how the energy appears.
 

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.480
So what does it look like to
you?

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:03.280
Have you seen these functions
before?

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:03.809
Yes?
 

00:48:03.809 --> 00:48:04.900
What does it look like?
 

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:08.199
Student:  One of the
spring wave theories?

00:48:08.199 --> 00:48:08.869
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:48:08.869 --> 00:48:10.239
Student:  One of the
spring wave theories?

00:48:10.239 --> 00:48:12.920
Prof: The equation is
like the spring equation.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:21.436
That is absolutely correct,
but what does this function

00:48:21.436 --> 00:48:23.329
look like?
 

00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:26.699
That function look like
something to you?

00:48:26.699 --> 00:48:27.510
Yep?
 

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.599
Student:  Isn't that a
cosine function?

00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:32.760
Prof: It's a cosine only
if A is equal to B.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.949
Forget the sines and cosines.
 

00:48:33.949 --> 00:48:35.320
They are your old flames.
 

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.260
What's their new quantum flame?
 

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:42.898
What's the function that means
a lot more in quantum mechanics

00:48:42.898 --> 00:48:45.210
than sines and cosines?
 

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:50.610
No?
 

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:55.454
I think I told you long back
that e to the i

00:48:55.454 --> 00:49:00.045
times dog x over ℏ
is a state where the

00:49:00.045 --> 00:49:02.510
momentum is equal to dog.
 

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:05.092
In other words,
you can put anything you want

00:49:05.092 --> 00:49:06.150
in the exponent.
 

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:10.112
If a function looks like that,
that fellow there is the

00:49:10.112 --> 00:49:10.920
momentum.
 

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:14.530
So this is a state of momentum,
of definite momentum.

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:20.996
In fact, look at this,
e to the i square

00:49:20.996 --> 00:49:27.708
root of 2mE/ℏ x 
B times e to the

00:49:27.708 --> 00:49:29.539
minus that.
 

00:49:29.539 --> 00:49:31.500
Do you understand?
 

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.579
This must be the momentum.
 

00:49:34.579 --> 00:49:37.376
It is the momentum because
e^(ipx/ℏ) is a state of

00:49:37.376 --> 00:49:40.150
momentum p,
but the momentum here can

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:45.134
either have one value,
square root of 2mE,

00:49:45.134 --> 00:49:52.989
or it can have another value
minus square root of 2mE.

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:58.851
So what do you think the
particle is doing in these

00:49:58.851 --> 00:50:00.260
solutions?
 

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:01.230
Yep?
 

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:03.472
Student:  It's jumping
back and forth _______________

00:50:03.472 --> 00:50:04.309
one of those states.
 

00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:08.559
Prof: But in any one of
them what is it doing here?

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:10.570
What is the sign of the
momentum here?

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:12.010
Student:  Oh, positive.
 

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.702
Prof: Positive,
and here it's got negative

00:50:14.702 --> 00:50:15.320
momentum.
 

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.989
And how much momentum does it
have?

00:50:16.989 --> 00:50:19.826
The momentum it has,
if you look at any of these

00:50:19.826 --> 00:50:23.601
things,
is that p^(2)/2m

00:50:23.601 --> 00:50:29.943
= E is what is satisfied
by the p that you have

00:50:29.943 --> 00:50:30.789
here.
 

00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:33.019
In other words,
what I'm telling you is in

00:50:33.019 --> 00:50:35.635
quantum theory,
in classical theory if I said,

00:50:35.635 --> 00:50:38.199
"I've got a particle of
energy E,

00:50:38.199 --> 00:50:40.500
what is its momentum?"
 

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.041
You would say, "Well,
E is

00:50:42.041 --> 00:50:45.905
p^(2)/2m,
therefore p is equal to

00:50:45.905 --> 00:50:49.003
plus or minus square root of
2mE,"

00:50:49.003 --> 00:50:52.860
because in one dimension when I
give you the energy,

00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:55.215
the Kinetic energy if you like,
the particle has to have a

00:50:55.215 --> 00:50:57.896
definite speed,
but it can be to the left or it

00:50:57.896 --> 00:50:59.210
can be to the right.
 

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:00.670
And the momentum is not
arbitrary.

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.891
If the energy is E the
momentum has to satisfy the

00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:06.539
condition p^(2)/2m
= E.

00:51:06.539 --> 00:51:09.889
That's also exactly what's
happening in the quantum theory.

00:51:09.889 --> 00:51:14.150
The state of definite energy is
a sum over two possible things,

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:17.929
one where the momentum is the
positive value for root of

00:51:17.929 --> 00:51:20.807
2mE;
other is a negative value,

00:51:20.807 --> 00:51:24.577
and these are the two allowed
values even in classical

00:51:24.577 --> 00:51:27.920
mechanics for a particle of
definite energy.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.610
But what's novel in quantum
mechanics,

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.309
whereas in classical mechanics
if it's got energy E it

00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:37.329
can only be going clockwise or
anti-clockwise,

00:51:37.329 --> 00:51:40.929
but this fellow can be doing
both because it's not in a state

00:51:40.929 --> 00:51:42.909
of clockwise or anti-clockwise.
 

00:51:42.909 --> 00:51:46.380
In fact, the probability for
clockwise is proportional to

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.309
A^(2).
 

00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:49.929
Probability for anti-clockwise
is proportional to B^(2).

00:51:49.929 --> 00:51:53.021
I've not normalized it,
but the relative odds are

00:51:53.021 --> 00:51:57.014
simply proportional to A^(2)
and B^(2). So that's

00:51:57.014 --> 00:52:00.880
what is bizarre about quantum
mechanics that the particle has

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:03.070
indefinite sign of momentum.
 

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:03.860
Yes?
 

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.047
Student:  Do we have
problem with m because

00:52:07.047 --> 00:52:09.610
m is too small to
________ properly?

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:10.409
Prof: Which one?
 

00:52:10.409 --> 00:52:13.534
Student:  With the mass
is there going to be some kind

00:52:13.534 --> 00:52:14.940
of issue if that's small?
 

00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:15.760
Prof: What about the
m?

00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.768
I'm sorry.
 

00:52:16.768 --> 00:52:18.722
Student:  m
stands for the mass,

00:52:18.722 --> 00:52:19.070
right?
 

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.567
Prof: Yeah,
m is the mass of the

00:52:20.567 --> 00:52:21.400
particle, that's right.
 

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.952
Student:  But is it too
small in some way for our

00:52:23.952 --> 00:52:26.460
equations to work because we had
that issue in previous

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.110
equations?
 

00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:28.690
Prof: When did we have
the issue?

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:31.780
m is whatever the mass
of the particle is.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:32.539
It can be small.
 

00:52:32.539 --> 00:52:35.550
It can be large.
 

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:36.340
I didn't understand.
 

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:37.400
Student:
&gt;

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.333
Prof: No,
no, go ahead.

00:52:38.333 --> 00:52:38.880
I want to know.
 

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:45.980
Student: 
&gt;

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.762
Prof: There are no
restrictions on the correctness

00:52:48.762 --> 00:52:49.260
of this.
 

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:53.500
If the particle weighs a
kilogram then you will find

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.409
that--well, we're coming to
this.

00:52:56.409 --> 00:52:59.690
So you find that these are the
allowed values of p.

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:02.155
There are two values,
but p itself is not

00:53:02.155 --> 00:53:04.619
arbitrary, p itself is
not continuous.

00:53:04.619 --> 00:53:06.460
Maybe that's what you meant.
 

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:09.583
There's a restriction on the
allowed values of p,

00:53:09.583 --> 00:53:13.219
and therefore a restriction on
the allowed values of E.

00:53:13.219 --> 00:53:16.829
All I'm telling you now is that
if you want to solve that

00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:20.632
equation it is obviously made up
of sines and cosines as you

00:53:20.632 --> 00:53:24.184
recognize from the oscillator,
or in the quantum world it's

00:53:24.184 --> 00:53:26.679
more natural to write them in
terms of exponentials,

00:53:26.679 --> 00:53:30.059
e^(ikx) and
e^(-ikx) where k is not

00:53:30.059 --> 00:53:33.181
independent of e,
k satisfies this

00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:36.000
condition, and if you call
ℏk as p,

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.559
p satisfies this
condition.

00:53:37.559 --> 00:53:41.186
This is just a classical
relation between energy and

00:53:41.186 --> 00:53:41.969
momentum.
 

00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:46.396
The other difference is that
not every value of momentum is

00:53:46.396 --> 00:53:47.159
allowed.
 

00:53:47.159 --> 00:53:50.822
Not every value of momentum is
allowed for the same reason as

00:53:50.822 --> 00:53:53.510
when I did particles of definite
momentum.

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:58.070
In other words,
if the particle is living on a

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:03.643
circle and the state of energy
E it's given by

00:54:03.643 --> 00:54:08.507
Ae^(ipx/â„ )
Be^(−ipx/â„ ) where

00:54:08.507 --> 00:54:15.400
p is related to E
by E = p^(2)/2m.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.880
We have the requirement that
when you go around a circle

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.730
you've got to come back to where
you start.

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:23.530
And that condition,
if you remember,

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:28.342
says that p times
L over ℏ has to

00:54:28.342 --> 00:54:32.760
be a multiple of some integer,
or that the allowed values of

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.190
p are labeled by some
index n,

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:38.349
which is 2Πâ„ /L
times n.

00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:41.485
I don't want to use m
because m stands for

00:54:41.485 --> 00:54:44.050
particle mass,
n is the integer now.

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:46.728
In other words,
when we studied the state of

00:54:46.728 --> 00:54:49.467
definite momentum,
namely the first function,

00:54:49.467 --> 00:54:52.768
we realized even then that
p is quantized.

00:54:52.768 --> 00:54:56.639
Because of the single valued
condition p is quantized.

00:54:56.639 --> 00:55:00.849
And if energy functions are
made up of such functions they

00:55:00.849 --> 00:55:03.139
also have to be singlevalued.
 

00:55:03.139 --> 00:55:08.954
That means the p here or
the -p here both have to

00:55:08.954 --> 00:55:12.518
satisfy the condition given by
this.

00:55:12.518 --> 00:55:18.534
Therefore, the allowed energies
are also labeled by an integer

00:55:18.534 --> 00:55:24.253
n and they are really
p n squared over

00:55:24.253 --> 00:55:29.478
2m where p
n is 2Πâ„  n

00:55:29.478 --> 00:55:31.550
over L .
 

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:32.619
You see that?
 

00:55:32.619 --> 00:55:37.300
This is the quantization of
energy.

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:41.777
So a particle in a ring has
only these allowed values of

00:55:41.777 --> 00:55:42.510
energy.
 

00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:48.164
So in a way this problem is
somewhat easy because it's a

00:55:48.164 --> 00:55:49.809
free particle.
 

00:55:49.809 --> 00:55:53.860
Once you've understood the
particles in terms of allowed

00:55:53.860 --> 00:55:58.574
momenta it turns out the allowed
momentum states are also allowed

00:55:58.574 --> 00:55:59.900
energy states.
 

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:03.152
The allowed momentum states,
you remember,

00:56:03.152 --> 00:56:06.880
they either look this or they
look like this.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:10.389
And I can pick A and
B to be arbitrary,

00:56:10.389 --> 00:56:13.382
so one choice is to pick
A equal to

00:56:13.382 --> 00:56:17.250
1/√L and just take
e^(ipx/â„ ).

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:22.262
Other is to pick B equal
to 1/√L and pick

00:56:22.262 --> 00:56:27.750
e^(−ipx/â„ ),
but you can also mix them up.

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:29.619
You don't have to mix them.
 

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:33.934
If you don't mix them up you
have a particle here which has a

00:56:33.934 --> 00:56:37.530
well-defined energy and a
well-defined momentum.

00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:39.762
This guy also has a
well-defined energy and a

00:56:39.762 --> 00:56:40.980
well-defined momentum.
 

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:43.748
This guy only has a
well-defined energy,

00:56:43.748 --> 00:56:47.793
but not a well-defined momentum
because there's a two-fold

00:56:47.793 --> 00:56:49.639
ambiguity in momentum.
 

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:50.329
You understand?
 

00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:52.320
Even in classical mechanics
it's true.

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.829
If I give you the momentum you
can find the energy.

00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:57.786
If I give you the energy you
cannot find the momentum because

00:56:57.786 --> 00:57:00.842
there are two square roots you
can take because p^(2)/2m

00:57:00.842 --> 00:57:02.795
is E,
p is plus or minus

00:57:02.795 --> 00:57:04.000
square root of 2mE.
 

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.349
It's the same uncertainty even
in classical mechanics.

00:57:08.349 --> 00:57:11.211
So what happens in quantum
theory is if you pick any

00:57:11.211 --> 00:57:14.523
particle of definite momentum on
the ring it'll already have

00:57:14.523 --> 00:57:17.722
definite energy which is simply
that momentum squared over

00:57:17.722 --> 00:57:18.619
2m.
 

00:57:18.619 --> 00:57:20.800
You don't need to find a new
function.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.342
What is novel is that since the
energy depends only on

00:57:24.342 --> 00:57:27.884
p^(2) you can take a
function with one value of

00:57:27.884 --> 00:57:30.172
p,
and you can take a function

00:57:30.172 --> 00:57:32.730
with the opposite value of
p and add them,

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:36.789
there will still be a state of
definite energy because whether

00:57:36.789 --> 00:57:40.583
it's doing this or whether it's
doing that the energy will

00:57:40.583 --> 00:57:44.777
always be p^(2)/2m
and the minus signs drop out of

00:57:44.777 --> 00:57:45.510
that.
 

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:50.280
So what is novel here is what's
called degeneracy.

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.724
Degeneracy is the name,
but there's more than one

00:57:53.724 --> 00:57:57.956
solution for a given value of
the variable you're interested

00:57:57.956 --> 00:57:58.460
in.
 

00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.110
You saw the energy looks like
this.

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:06.552
Therefore, you'll find there's
a state E_0

00:58:06.552 --> 00:58:09.929
which is 0 squared over
2m.

00:58:09.929 --> 00:58:15.250
Then there are two states
E_1.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:19.474
One has got momentum p
going clockwise and one has

00:58:19.474 --> 00:58:21.889
momentum going anti-clockwise.
 

00:58:21.889 --> 00:58:27.784
So they look like
(1/√L)

00:58:27.784 --> 00:58:31.550
e^(2Πix/L).
 

00:58:31.550 --> 00:58:33.369
That's this guy.
 

00:58:33.369 --> 00:58:37.655
Then you can have
(1/√L)

00:58:37.655 --> 00:58:43.250
e^(-2Πix/L) which is
the other guy.

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:47.507
So at every-energy,
allowed energy except 0,

00:58:47.507 --> 00:58:50.280
there'll be two solutions.
 

00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:54.050
There are two quantum states
with the same energy.

00:58:54.050 --> 00:58:56.826
When you studied hydrogen atom
in high school maybe you

00:58:56.826 --> 00:58:59.139
remember there are these shells
with 2, and 4,

00:58:59.139 --> 00:59:00.579
and 8, and 10 and so on.
 

00:59:00.579 --> 00:59:03.559
They are called degeneracies
where the energy is not enough

00:59:03.559 --> 00:59:05.099
to tell you what it's doing.
 

00:59:05.099 --> 00:59:07.443
There at every-energy it can
have a different angular

00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:07.940
momentum.
 

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:11.954
Here at every-energy it can
have two different momenta,

00:59:11.954 --> 00:59:14.260
clockwise and anti-clockwise.
 

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:15.010
Yep?
 

00:59:15.010 --> 00:59:19.063
Student:  Going back can
you explain how you got the

00:59:19.063 --> 00:59:22.070
________ of p L over ℏ
________?

00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:22.670
Prof: Here?
 

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:24.449
Student:  To the left.
 

00:59:24.449 --> 00:59:25.940
Prof: Here?
 

00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:26.989
You mean this one?
 

00:59:26.989 --> 00:59:28.329
Student:  I don't where
that came from.

00:59:28.329 --> 00:59:30.969
Prof: It came just like
in the momentum problem.

00:59:30.969 --> 00:59:34.525
If you've got a function like
this you have a right to demand

00:59:34.525 --> 00:59:37.784
that if you go a distance
L around the circle you

00:59:37.784 --> 00:59:39.739
come back to where you start.
 

00:59:39.739 --> 00:59:44.485
So if you take any x here and
add to it an L it should not

00:59:44.485 --> 00:59:46.150
make a difference.
 

00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:49.900
And what you're adding is
pL/ℏ and that better be

00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.349
a multiple of 2Π.
 

00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:53.929
It's the same single valuedness
condition.

00:59:53.929 --> 00:59:56.985
So the momentum problem pretty
much does this problem for you,

00:59:56.985 --> 00:59:59.489
all the singlevalued stuff we
dealt with before.

00:59:59.489 --> 01:00:03.817
What is novel here is that
demanding energy have one value

01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:07.309
fixes the momentum to be one of
two values,

01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:10.644
and that double valuedness is
the same as in classical theory

01:00:10.644 --> 01:00:13.702
that a particle of energy
E can have two possible

01:00:13.702 --> 01:00:16.650
momenta plus or minus square
root of 2mE,

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:21.581
and the quantum theory,
then, is the state of E

01:00:21.581 --> 01:00:26.418
is a sum of one value of
p and the other value

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:30.699
of p with any coefficient
you like.

01:00:30.699 --> 01:00:35.079
So if this atom makes a jump
from,

01:00:35.079 --> 01:00:37.400
or this system makes a jump
from somewhere there to

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.373
somewhere there you can find the
frequency of the photons it will

01:00:40.373 --> 01:00:42.510
emit because here are my allowed
energies.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:45.619
E_n is this.
 

01:00:45.619 --> 01:00:51.420
Suppose it jumps from
n=4 to n=3.

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:56.306
The energy that's liberated
that goes to the photon is

01:00:56.306 --> 01:01:01.286
â„ ω will be
4Π^(2) â„ ^(2) over

01:01:01.286 --> 01:01:05.989
2mL squared times 4
squared - 3 squared.

01:01:05.989 --> 01:01:08.518
I'm just using this formula
with n=4,

01:01:08.518 --> 01:01:10.989
and n=3,
and take the difference.

01:01:10.989 --> 01:01:13.030
It's 16 - 9 which 7.
 

01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:16.590
You plug all that in you can
solve for the ω,

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:20.599
or if you like frequency you
can write it as 2Πâ„ f

01:01:20.599 --> 01:01:22.940
and you can find the
frequencies.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.250
This is actually true.
 

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:27.492
If you've got a charged
particle moving in a ring and

01:01:27.492 --> 01:01:31.358
you want to excite it from one
state to a higher state you will

01:01:31.358 --> 01:01:34.851
have to give it only one of
these frequencies so that the

01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:37.585
frequency you give it,
â„ ω,

01:01:37.585 --> 01:01:40.159
must match the energy
difference of the particle.

01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:42.670
You understand?
 

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:44.768
So I've drawn these levels here.
 

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:48.309
If you want the electrons,
say, in a metallic ring going

01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:50.820
in the lowest possible energy
state,

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.175
if you want to jump,
if you want to crank it up to

01:01:53.175 --> 01:01:56.059
the next level you've got to
have photons at that energy,

01:01:56.059 --> 01:01:57.570
or that energy.
 

01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:59.681
Well, that happens to be the
same as this,

01:01:59.681 --> 01:02:02.306
but these are the only
frequencies it'll absorb from

01:02:02.306 --> 01:02:02.719
you.
 

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:08.081
And when it cools down it'll
emit back those frequencies,

01:02:08.081 --> 01:02:11.530
and that's something you can
test.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:18.164
By the way, do you know why
there's only one state at

01:02:18.164 --> 01:02:22.630
E_0 and not
two?

01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:23.469
Yep?
 

01:02:23.469 --> 01:02:26.329
Student:  Because 0
equals -0.

01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:27.599
Prof: That's right.
 

01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:30.932
The solution plus or minus
2m square root of

01:02:30.932 --> 01:02:34.800
2mE has only one-answer
when E is 0 because 0

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.599
momentum and -0 momentum are the
same.

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:41.605
Otherwise, any finite positive
momentum has a partner which is

01:02:41.605 --> 01:02:43.050
minus that momentum.
 

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:46.318
There's a very interesting
piece of work being done

01:02:46.318 --> 01:02:50.177
experimentally at Yale which is
the claim that if you took a

01:02:50.177 --> 01:02:53.773
metallic ring in a magnetic
field it will have a current

01:02:53.773 --> 01:02:57.445
going one way or the other way,
unbalanced current,

01:02:57.445 --> 01:02:59.570
and it's not driven by a
battery.

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:02.579
It's not driven by anything.
 

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:05.793
Normally if you took an
ordinary ring the lowest energy

01:03:05.793 --> 01:03:09.365
state will be a field of zero
current while you go one way or

01:03:09.365 --> 01:03:11.454
the other,
but if you put it in the

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:14.541
magnetic field one can show it
likes to go one way or the other

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:14.889
way.
 

01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:17.882
And now measurements are being
done at Yale where you can

01:03:17.882 --> 01:03:20.929
actually measure the tiny
current due to one electron,

01:03:20.929 --> 01:03:24.929
or one net electron going one
way or the other.

01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:28.311
So this L is either a
mathematical convenience if

01:03:28.311 --> 01:03:31.817
you're talking about free space
and you want to be able to

01:03:31.817 --> 01:03:35.079
normalize your wave functions,
or it really is the

01:03:35.079 --> 01:03:36.949
circumference of a real system.
 

01:03:36.949 --> 01:03:41.132
Now that we can probe nano
systems very well we can vary

01:03:41.132 --> 01:03:45.469
the L and we can find out
all the energy levels.

01:03:45.469 --> 01:03:51.715
All right, so now I'm going to
do the one problem which is

01:03:51.715 --> 01:03:56.427
really a very standard
pedagogical exercise,

01:03:56.427 --> 01:04:01.030
and that's called a particle in
a box.

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:05.405
I remember this example the
first time I remember seeing

01:04:05.405 --> 01:04:08.826
quantization,
which is more interesting than

01:04:08.826 --> 01:04:09.940
on a ring.
 

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:11.670
A box is the following.
 

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:16.855
If you dig a hole in the ground
and you are standing somewhere

01:04:16.855 --> 01:04:21.869
here you realize you're kind of
trapped unless you can scale

01:04:21.869 --> 01:04:23.059
this wall.
 

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:25.882
Now, you can call that as a
ground level and think of it as

01:04:25.882 --> 01:04:29.096
a hole in the ground,
or you can think of this as the

01:04:29.096 --> 01:04:32.530
ground level and that's the
height of your barrier.

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:38.420
So imagine a particle living in
a barrier that looks like this.

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.530
This is the potential energy.
 

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:41.750
This is like the height above
the ground,

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:43.400
if you like,
and it has a height

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:47.106
V_0 t here,
and is 0 here,

01:04:47.106 --> 01:04:55.190
and it goes from some
−L/2 to L/2.

01:04:55.190 --> 01:05:00.027
If the barrier
V_0 goes to

01:05:00.027 --> 01:05:03.369
infinity it's called a box.
 

01:05:03.369 --> 01:05:07.007
So a barrier that goes to
infinity, I'll just show you the

01:05:07.007 --> 01:05:08.860
part that you can see here.
 

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:12.527
Here V is infinity,
and here V is infinity

01:05:12.527 --> 01:05:14.329
and inside V is 0.
 

01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:16.719
That's a particle in a box.
 

01:05:16.719 --> 01:05:20.429
So if the particle goes hits
against the wall it cannot,

01:05:20.429 --> 01:05:24.409
no matter how fast it's moving,
go over the top because it's

01:05:24.409 --> 01:05:25.760
infinitely high.
 

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.670
And that's not realistic.
 

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:32.360
Every barrier is finite,
but just to teach you the

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.860
principles we always pick the
simple example.

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:39.449
So now I want to solve this
problem.

01:05:39.449 --> 01:05:42.972
What are the allowed wave
functions, ψ,

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:45.909
for a particle in this
potential?

01:05:45.909 --> 01:05:51.152
So let's go back to the same
equation which says

01:05:51.152 --> 01:05:57.400
-â„ ^(2)/2m
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2)

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.969
= E - V ψ.
 

01:06:00.969 --> 01:06:05.780
What I've done is I've taken
V to the other side.

01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:09.510
Now the potential is a constant
in the three regions.

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:12.039
This is region I where the
potential is 0.

01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:14.639
This is region II where the
potential is infinity.

01:06:14.639 --> 01:06:19.230
This is region III where the
potential is infinity.

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:25.590
I'm going to first look at the
region here, region III.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:30.882
What's the solution going to
look like in region III is what

01:06:30.882 --> 01:06:32.050
I'm asking.
 

01:06:32.050 --> 01:06:34.697
So in this region the energy's
something I don't know what the

01:06:34.697 --> 01:06:35.610
allowed values are.
 

01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:39.099
Whatever the value is V is an
extremely large number.

01:06:39.099 --> 01:06:40.630
Can you see that?
 

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.469
In this region don't let the
barrier be infinity.

01:06:43.469 --> 01:06:47.179
Imagine it's one zillion,
a very high barrier.

01:06:47.179 --> 01:06:48.750
Then what's the solution?
 

01:06:48.750 --> 01:06:59.753
The solution will look like
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2)

01:06:59.753 --> 01:07:09.239
is = 2m/â„ ^(2) times
V - E ψ.

01:07:09.239 --> 01:07:11.030
Then the solution to that is
very easy,

01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:20.195
ψ = Ae^(κx)
Be^(-κx) where

01:07:20.195 --> 01:07:28.318
κ is equal to all of this,
square root of

01:07:28.318 --> 01:07:34.530
2m/ℏ^(2) times V -
E.

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:39.920
I'm saying this is what I'm
calling κ^(2).

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.461
Look, I'm asking you give me a
function whose second derivative

01:07:43.461 --> 01:07:45.518
is some number times the
function.

01:07:45.518 --> 01:07:49.231
Well, that's obviously
exponential and it's the real

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:52.943
exponential because it's a
positive number times the

01:07:52.943 --> 01:07:53.889
function.
 

01:07:53.889 --> 01:07:56.559
Now A and B are
free parameters,

01:07:56.559 --> 01:07:58.289
whatever they are it'll solve
the equation,

01:07:58.289 --> 01:08:01.751
but we don't want a function
that's growing exponentially

01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:05.521
when you go to infinity because
that means that particle would

01:08:05.521 --> 01:08:09.230
rather be at infinity than in
your box or near your box.

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:13.625
So for that mathematical,
for that physical reason we

01:08:13.625 --> 01:08:15.400
junk this function.
 

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.074
You pick it on physical grounds
as not having a part growing

01:08:19.074 --> 01:08:21.630
exponentially when you go to
infinity,

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:24.761
but you do admit a part that's
falling exponentially when you

01:08:24.761 --> 01:08:25.649
go to infinity.
 

01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:26.949
That's okay.
 

01:08:26.949 --> 01:08:29.118
But how fast is it falling?
 

01:08:29.118 --> 01:08:32.365
It's going like B e to
the minus some blah,

01:08:32.365 --> 01:08:35.479
blah, blah times square root of
V - E.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:37.840
That's all I want you to look
at.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.800
Forget all the ℏ's and
m's.

01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.395
Make V larger,
and larger, and larger,

01:08:42.395 --> 01:08:45.050
and just tell me what you think
it will do.

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:47.484
If V is larger and
larger it's like this

01:08:47.484 --> 01:08:50.979
e^(-αx) I wrote for
you where α's very large.

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:54.171
So this function will fall
faster, and faster,

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:58.570
and faster, and in the limit in
which V goes to infinity

01:08:58.570 --> 01:08:59.920
it will vanish.
 

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:07.259
That basically means the
particle cannot be found outside

01:09:07.259 --> 01:09:08.569
the box.
 

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:13.408
So your function ψ
is 0 here and 0 here.

01:09:13.408 --> 01:09:17.360
Because if you made the barrier
height finite you will find it's

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:19.868
falling exponentially on either
side,

01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:22.099
but the exponential becomes
narrower and narrower as the

01:09:22.099 --> 01:09:23.600
barrier becomes higher and
higher,

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.978
and in the limit in which the
wall is infinitely tall there is

01:09:27.978 --> 01:09:29.270
nothing outside.
 

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:35.909
The wave function is non-0 only
inside.

01:09:35.909 --> 01:09:37.779
So what's the solution inside?
 

01:09:37.779 --> 01:09:39.109
Let me call this 0.
 

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:41.029
Let me call this L.
 

01:09:41.029 --> 01:09:43.948
Inside the box there is no
potential,

01:09:43.948 --> 01:09:50.840
so this equation is
d^(2)ψ/dx^(2)

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:55.250
(2mE/â„ ^(2))ψ
= 0.

01:09:55.250 --> 01:09:59.577
It's like a free particle in
the box, but it cannot leave the

01:09:59.577 --> 01:10:00.010
box.
 

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:04.210
This is what I called k,
remember?

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:07.694
So now I'm going to purposely
write the solution in terms of

01:10:07.694 --> 01:10:09.229
trigonometric functions.
 

01:10:09.229 --> 01:10:11.439
You'll see in a minute why.
 

01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:16.413
So I'm going to write this
Ae^(ikx)

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:18.720
Be^(-ikx).
 

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:21.520
You can see if I take any of
these solutions it's going to

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:25.265
satisfy the equation,
but k better be related to E in

01:10:25.265 --> 01:10:29.273
this form,
2mE/ℏ^(2) is equal to

01:10:29.273 --> 01:10:30.680
k^(2).
 

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:35.680
Sorry that's k^(2).
 

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:39.015
Because two derivatives of this
will give me

01:10:39.015 --> 01:10:43.671
−k^(2), and if you
put that particular value for

01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:47.630
−k^(2) here these
two will cancel.

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:53.143
But I'm somehow going for--I'm
sorry, I'm going to not write it

01:10:53.143 --> 01:10:57.590
this way, but write it as
C cosine kx

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:00.078
D sine kx.
 

01:11:00.078 --> 01:11:02.582
Do you realize I can always go
back and forth between

01:11:02.582 --> 01:11:05.277
exponentials and trigonometric
functions because one is a

01:11:05.277 --> 01:11:07.010
linear combination of the other?
 

01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:09.494
If you want,
write this as cos i sine

01:11:09.494 --> 01:11:12.788
and cos - i sine and
rearrange the coefficients.

01:11:12.788 --> 01:11:14.430
It'll look like something,
something cosine.

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:16.529
I want to call that a C,
and something,

01:11:16.529 --> 01:11:18.815
something sine which I want to
call this D,

01:11:18.815 --> 01:11:20.729
D and C may be
complex.

01:11:20.729 --> 01:11:23.860
I'm not saying anything,
but you can write a solution

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.654
either in terms of the sines and
cosines or E to the plus

01:11:27.654 --> 01:11:29.039
or minus something.
 

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:31.408
So here's the function ψ.
 

01:11:31.408 --> 01:11:35.788
It looks like I have an answer
for every energy I want,

01:11:35.788 --> 01:11:39.877
because pick any energy you
like, find the corresponding

01:11:39.877 --> 01:11:44.550
k,
you put it here and you're done.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:49.715
But that's not allowed because
we have an extra condition which

01:11:49.715 --> 01:11:54.630
is the ψ was identically 0
here, ψ was identically 0

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:55.380
here.
 

01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:57.408
We're going to demand that at
the two ends,

01:11:57.408 --> 01:11:59.220
it can do whatever it wants in
the middle,

01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:02.476
it must vanish at the two ends
for the continuity of ψ

01:12:02.476 --> 01:12:05.047
because if ψ
had two values you're getting

01:12:05.047 --> 01:12:08.020
two different probabilities for
the same point,

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:09.600
so that's not allowed.
 

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.000
So ψ must have--must match
at the two ends.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.479
But look at this function.
 

01:12:16.479 --> 01:12:20.918
It's got to vanish at the left
end at x = 0 and it's got to

01:12:20.918 --> 01:12:22.908
vanish at the right end.
 

01:12:22.908 --> 01:12:28.578
At x = 0 you can see
ψ of 0 is simply C

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:31.010
because sine vanishes.
 

01:12:31.010 --> 01:12:35.654
Cosine is 1 and C has to
be 0 then because this guy has

01:12:35.654 --> 01:12:39.079
no business being non-zero on
the left end.

01:12:39.079 --> 01:12:42.520
That's good.
 

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.537
This guy vanishes at the left
end so I allow it,

01:12:45.537 --> 01:12:47.529
but I have another condition.
 

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:51.750
It should also vanish at the
right end.

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:56.704
If it should vanish at the
right end I demand that sine

01:12:56.704 --> 01:13:01.844
kL should be 0 because
sine kL vanishing is

01:13:01.844 --> 01:13:02.670
fine.
 

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.460
Then it'll vanish at both ends.
 

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:14.430
But sine kL = 0 means kL
is a multiple of Π.

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:20.118
That means k is
nΠ/L.

01:13:20.118 --> 01:13:25.367
This means the allowed values
of k in the problem are very

01:13:25.367 --> 01:13:30.614
special so here is n = 1,
ψ looks like

01:13:30.614 --> 01:13:37.190
sin(Πx/L),
and equal to 2 looks like

01:13:37.190 --> 01:13:42.849
sin(2Πx/L),
and so on with some numbers in

01:13:42.849 --> 01:13:45.380
front which I have not chosen
yet.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:47.270
If you plot them they look like
this.

01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:48.479
That's one guy.
 

01:13:48.479 --> 01:13:50.939
At a higher energy I've got
that guy.

01:13:50.939 --> 01:13:55.529
Then I've got that and so on
because these are exactly like

01:13:55.529 --> 01:13:59.327
waves on a string,
a violin string clamped at two

01:13:59.327 --> 01:14:00.038
ends.
 

01:14:00.038 --> 01:14:03.353
In fact, this wave equation's
identical to the wave equation

01:14:03.353 --> 01:14:04.140
on a string.
 

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.868
The only requirement is that
the string is clamped at two

01:14:06.868 --> 01:14:07.210
ends.
 

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.212
Here the ψ
is clamped at the two ends

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:12.220
because it's got to vanish on
either side outside the box.

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:15.180
So the allowed wavelengths are
the same except here the

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:18.359
wavelength is connected to the
momentum that's connected to

01:14:18.359 --> 01:14:21.273
energy and E,
you remember,

01:14:21.273 --> 01:14:24.953
is
ℏ^(2)k^(2)/2m

01:14:24.953 --> 01:14:29.940
then becomes
ℏ^(2)/2m times

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:33.740
k will be
n^(2)Π

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:36.710
^(2)/L^(2).
 

01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:40.275
So this particle in a box can
have only these particular

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:40.988
energies.
 

01:14:40.988 --> 01:14:42.238
So let me write it for you
nicely.

01:14:42.238 --> 01:14:48.786
The allowed energies are
â„ ^(2) Π^(2)/2

01:14:48.786 --> 01:14:55.198
mL squared times an
integer n squared,

01:14:55.198 --> 01:14:58.538
and the corresponding wave
functions look like this.

01:14:58.538 --> 01:15:01.726
They're waves in which you've
got half an oscillation,

01:15:01.726 --> 01:15:04.493
or 2 half oscillations and 3
half oscillations,

01:15:04.493 --> 01:15:07.140
but you've got to start and
finish at 0.

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:08.760
So it's the quantization.
 

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.302
This is why when Schr�dinger
came up with this equation

01:15:11.302 --> 01:15:14.162
everybody embraced it right away
because you suddenly understood

01:15:14.162 --> 01:15:15.390
why energy's quantized.
 

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:18.506
You're trying to fit some
number of waves into an interval

01:15:18.506 --> 01:15:21.680
and only some multiple of half
wavelengths are allowed,

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:23.640
but wavelength translates into
momentum.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:25.170
That translates into energy.
 

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:29.050
Suddenly you understand the
quantization of energy.

01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:30.948
So it's got 1 state
n = 1,

01:15:30.948 --> 01:15:32.801
and only one state
n = 2,

01:15:32.801 --> 01:15:34.470
one state n =
3.

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:38.863
I'm going to come back to this
next time, but you should think

01:15:38.863 --> 01:15:39.800
about this.
 

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:45.000

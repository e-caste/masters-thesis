00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.258
Prof: I said at the
start of the last lecture that

00:00:05.258 --> 00:00:08.730
after the episodes that I will
be discussing then,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.270
the cave of Montesinos and
Master Peter's puppet show,

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.560
three significant new
developments take place in

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.500
the Quixote;
I want to go over them again.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.033
The first is that Don Quixote
will sometimes not be the center

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:29.752
of the action,
which will focus instead on

00:00:29.752 --> 00:00:30.750
Sancho.
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.932
The second is that both
protagonists become objects of

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:39.351
amusement for aristocratic
frivolous characters that have

00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:43.770
read Part I and want them to
behave according to it.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.653
The third is that Don Quixote
and Sancho will be surrounded by

00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:53.030
many more characters than
before.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.846
The overarching theme of the
novel continues to be

00:00:56.846 --> 00:01:01.597
desengaño and most
of the episodes are staged by

00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:06.227
authors within the fiction,
which is highly theatrical,

00:01:06.227 --> 00:01:08.920
and the backstage of the
pranks,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.120
the stage machinery as it were,
is revealed to the reader,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.739
either during their performance
or right after.

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:23.269
The episode of the enchanted
boat,

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:29.629
of which I gave you an
illustration of which appears in

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:35.682
the handout that I gave you,
was needed to get our

00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:39.800
protagonists across the Ebro
river;

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.367
and we're going to show a map
of Spain, although we have

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:52.459
already shown you a map about
where this appears.

00:01:52.459 --> 00:02:00.141
We have to get them across Ebro
river--I forgot my pointer

00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:06.340
today--but you can see the Ebro
right there.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:15.842
In Part I, the territory that
Don Quixote and Sancho covered

00:02:15.842 --> 00:02:22.930
was not very specific in
geographic terms.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.882
Seville is mentioned as the
destination of the prostitutes

00:02:27.882 --> 00:02:33.150
at the first inn,
and also it is mentioned as the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.720
destination of Andrés,
when he reappears.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.873
The Sierra Morena is the
setting for Don Quixote's

00:02:43.873 --> 00:02:50.080
penance, and the place where
Cardenio is hiding in shame and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.660
in madness.
 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.837
This relative vagueness is
consistent with the narrator's

00:02:56.837 --> 00:03:02.479
refusal to mention the village
where Alonso Quijano lives,

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.568
and to which Don Quixote
returns.

00:03:06.568 --> 00:03:11.195
Now, however,
in Part II, geography becomes

00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:16.538
much more precise,
starting with El Toboso,

00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:22.096
our protagonist's first stop,
which is a real village in

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:25.006
Castile,
and continuing with their

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:29.360
original destination,
Saragossa, where Don Quixote

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.154
wants to participate in jousts
celebrated on St.

00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:35.736
George's Day--April
twenty-third,

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:40.500
and we talked about that in one
of my earlier classes.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.520
A stream figures in the episode
of the fulling hammers,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.815
but now Don Quixote and Sancho
on their way to Saragossa have

00:03:50.815 --> 00:03:55.418
to get across the Ebro,
one of the major rivers of

00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:56.038
Spain.
 

00:03:56.038 --> 00:04:00.968
We can see another image
of--there you are--of the Ebro.

00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:05.468
I highlight this because,
of course,

00:04:05.468 --> 00:04:09.764
Castile is not only landlocked,
but there is very little water

00:04:09.764 --> 00:04:14.429
in Castile,
and this is reflected in the

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:20.079
novel where it only rains once
in Part I,

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.350
there is that stream where the
fulling hammers appear,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.120
but on the whole there is very
little water.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:42.940
I'm going to turn the lights
back on.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.154
So the second part adds
geographic concreteness to its

00:04:49.154 --> 00:04:53.610
realistic portrayal of Spanish
life.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.319
This is not new with Cervantes.
 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.750
This he derives from the
picaresque.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.660
In Lazarillo de Tormes,
Tormes is a river;

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.249
it's the river that goes
through Salamanca,

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:10.129
as a matter of fact.
 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.838
And in the Guzmán de
Alfarache,

00:05:13.838 --> 00:05:21.639
the geography is quite precise,
both in Spain and in Italy,

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.209
where Guzmán travels
also through Italy.

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:32.005
So Cervantes has derived this
concreteness from the

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:37.057
picaresque,
but the episode of the

00:05:37.057 --> 00:05:43.600
enchanted boat also serves to
highlight--

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.341
comically, of course--the
difference between Don Quixote's

00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:53.416
obsolete Ptolemaic notions of
geography and the new Copernican

00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:58.889
conception of the universe,
which is being expanded both as

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.240
knowledge and as a field of
knowledge as Cervantes writes.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:10.014
What I mean by that is the
Copernican universe is infinite,

00:06:10.014 --> 00:06:13.600
the Ptolemaic universe is
limited.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:20.949
Now, this--Galileo was making
important discoveries in favor

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:27.800
of Copernicanism in the early
decades of the seventeenth

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.358
century--
he was in Spain for a

00:06:31.358 --> 00:06:36.069
while--and developing
instruments of observation,

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:37.709
like the telescope.
 

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:43.144
But Don Quixote still adheres
to Ptolemaic ideas and

00:06:43.144 --> 00:06:46.406
calculations,
as he demonstrates in his

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:50.608
hilarious exchange with Sancho,
when he asks his squire to

00:06:50.608 --> 00:06:53.829
check if he has any lice on his
body,

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:59.509
because it was common lore that
upon crossing the equator all

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:04.769
such vermin would perish,
as if by magic.

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:10.081
Sancho discovers that his flees
or lice are still very much

00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:15.666
alive, and he underscores the
plural when saying that he has a

00:07:15.666 --> 00:07:16.399
few.
 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.985
Like chivalry,
Ptolemaic geography is a

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:25.555
medieval retention struggling to
survive in a world in which

00:07:25.555 --> 00:07:30.557
after the discovery and
settlement of the New World it

00:07:30.557 --> 00:07:34.783
was wholly untenable,
except to the likes of Don

00:07:34.783 --> 00:07:37.889
Quixote or to Sancho,
who doesn't care either way.

00:07:37.889 --> 00:07:41.069
It doesn't make any difference
to Sancho, of course.

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:45.810
The crossing of the river is
significant also because our

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.129
characters are moving beyond
landlocked Castile,

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:55.065
toward coastal regions of Spain
that are in touch with other

00:07:55.065 --> 00:08:00.819
cultures and languages,
and in this second part we will

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:06.709
reach such areas Barcelona where
Catalan is spoke.

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:12.247
The episode is a rewriting,
since we're talking always

00:08:12.247 --> 00:08:18.726
about these episodes of Part II
being rewritings of episodes of

00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:21.507
Part I,
this episode to me is a

00:08:21.507 --> 00:08:24.629
rewriting of the windmills
episode in Part I,

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:29.870
because of the wheels in the
river,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.775
with similar results,
except that Don Quixote and

00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:38.321
Sancho have,
again, to make restitutions for

00:08:38.321 --> 00:08:41.428
damages,
and as all crossings,

00:08:41.428 --> 00:08:45.408
this crossings also a
transition.

00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:51.418
Now, I have given you a handout
with the scene of Don Quixote's

00:08:51.418 --> 00:08:57.042
exchange with Sancho on the
issue of the distance they have

00:08:57.042 --> 00:09:01.558
traveled in--
and as this exchange appears in

00:09:01.558 --> 00:09:07.269
various English translations,
so that we can be amused by the

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:12.580
efforts that the translators
make to render it into English

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:18.476
the puns that are involved,
which are a little bit obscene

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:21.585
in the Spanish,
if you have your handout,

00:09:21.585 --> 00:09:22.850
if not, I have copies.
 

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.330
Does anybody need one?
 

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:32.756
After Sancho wonders how much
they have traveled,

00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:36.442
he said:
"'Mucho,' replicó

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:39.094
Don Quijote,
'porque de trescientos sesenta

00:09:39.094 --> 00:09:42.708
grados que contiene el globo del
agua y de la tierra según

00:09:42.708 --> 00:09:45.745
el cómputo de Ptolomeo,
que fue el mayor

00:09:45.745 --> 00:09:49.913
cosmógrafo que se sabe,
la mitad habremos caminado

00:09:49.913 --> 00:09:53.038
llegando a la línea que
he dicho.'

00:09:53.038 --> 00:09:57.142
'Por Dios' dijo Sancho,
'que vuesa merced me trae por

00:09:57.142 --> 00:10:00.850
testigo de lo que dice a una
gentil persona,

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.250
puto y gafo,
con la añadidura de

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.509
meón,
o meo, o no sé

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:09.798
cómo.'"
I think I explained in the last

00:10:09.798 --> 00:10:14.605
class the ugly word in Spanish
to say to urinate is

00:10:14.605 --> 00:10:19.220
"mear,"
equivalent in English of

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.200
"to piss,"
and,

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.019
of course, in the word,
in Ptolemy,

00:10:25.019 --> 00:10:26.993
in Spanish,
"Ptolomeo,"

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:30.571
there seems to be included the
first person singular of the

00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:33.408
indicative of the word
"mear,"

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:36.739
"yo meo,"
this is what Sancho hears in

00:10:36.739 --> 00:10:39.423
Ptolomeo's name;
And "c&amp;oacut

00:10:39.423 --> 00:10:41.408
e;mputo,"
computation,

00:10:41.408 --> 00:10:44.726
of course, to him what he hears
is "puto,"

00:10:44.726 --> 00:10:47.529
which is the masculine of
"puta,"

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:49.990
which is whore and it means
homosexual.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:56.580
So what Don Quixote has told
him lacks all authority;

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:02.600
is what he's saying when his
authorities have to do with a

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:08.408
person who is a homosexual and
someone how pisses a lot,

00:11:08.408 --> 00:11:12.000
and this is what Sancho hears.
 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.990
The efforts by our translator,
by Jarvis,

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.634
is not very good:
"'By the lord,' quoth

00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:26.251
Sancho,
'your worship has brought a

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:29.344
very pretty fellow,
that same Tolmy [how d'you call

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:30.977
him?]
with his amputation to vouch

00:11:30.977 --> 00:11:32.808
the truth of what you
say.'"

00:11:32.808 --> 00:11:35.158
He's trying to get
"computation"

00:11:35.158 --> 00:11:38.080
and "amputation"
to try to get the pun;

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.529
it's not very funny.
 

00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:42.980
It's not very good.
 

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.773
Smollett, in the same
eighteenth century tries to get:

00:11:45.773 --> 00:11:48.934
"'For God!' cried Sancho,
your worship has brought a set

00:11:48.934 --> 00:11:51.940
of rare witnesses to prove the
truth of what you say.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.734
Copulation and Kiss-me-Gaffer,
with the addition of

00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:56.970
Tool-i'-me, or some such
name.'"

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:01.062
This is actually better,
because it catches the spirit

00:12:01.062 --> 00:12:04.460
of the obscenity of what Sancho
is saying.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.812
Our own Rutherford,
from Oxford University:

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:15.580
"'Good God,' said Sancho,
'that's a fine character you've

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.341
dredged up as a witness,
with his sexy butts and his

00:12:18.341 --> 00:12:20.158
tomfoolery,
and what's more a great

00:12:20.158 --> 00:12:22.118
pornographer,
or whatever it was you

00:12:22.118 --> 00:12:26.830
said.'"
These are all efforts.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:29.523
The point is that,
of course, Cervantes is making

00:12:29.523 --> 00:12:31.600
fun of the whole Ptolemaic
system,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.740
which by this time is obsolete,
but Don Quixote,

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.706
of course, is invoking it,
as his authority to tell where

00:12:39.706 --> 00:12:43.389
it is that they're going as they
ride on the boat.

00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:49.005
You can amuse yourselves in
trying your hand at translating

00:12:49.005 --> 00:12:51.330
that pun, if you want.
 

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:56.408
Now, when Don Quixote and
Sancho arrive at the house of

00:12:56.408 --> 00:13:02.144
the duke and duchess they enter
a realm of games and frivolity

00:13:02.144 --> 00:13:05.528
that they have not known before.
 

00:13:05.528 --> 00:13:11.197
These are irresponsible
aristocrats that belong to the

00:13:11.197 --> 00:13:15.350
leisure class;
in fact, the house in which the

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:19.287
action takes place is not even
their regular house,

00:13:19.287 --> 00:13:22.278
it is a summer home for
recreation.

00:13:22.278 --> 00:13:26.964
Don Quixote first meets the
Duchess, who his out falcon

00:13:26.964 --> 00:13:32.168
hunting, all decked out for the
occasion and surrounded by an

00:13:32.168 --> 00:13:33.990
entourage.
 

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.870
This business of hunting with
falcons was very ceremonial,

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.350
people just went out with
servants,

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.850
and so forth,
and the falcons,

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:50.601
the hawks,
were trained to catch the prey,

00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:52.038
and so forth.
 

00:13:52.038 --> 00:13:55.274
There wasn't much real exercise
involved, I think,

00:13:55.274 --> 00:13:58.971
as the hawks did all of the
work, but this is part of the

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:01.350
recreation of these aristocrats.
 

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.107
The duke and duchess are
devoted to pleasure,

00:14:06.107 --> 00:14:12.272
one of which is obviously
reading, for they know Part I of

00:14:12.272 --> 00:14:15.950
the Quixote quite well.
 

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.517
They are idle readers,
like the one Cervantes

00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:22.759
addressed at the beginning of
Part I,

00:14:22.759 --> 00:14:24.807
and I underline
"idle"

00:14:24.807 --> 00:14:26.259
in this description.
 

00:14:26.259 --> 00:14:31.220
Don Quixote and Sancho are like
toys to the duke and duchess,

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:36.120
or better, they are like
literary characters,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.759
which, in fact,
that's exactly what they are.

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:44.024
Everything in their home--I
mean, Don Quixote and Sancho

00:14:44.024 --> 00:14:47.470
have sort of fallen on the
hands,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.139
of these people who are great
readers of Part I,

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:52.913
and, wow!, here we have the
"real"

00:14:52.913 --> 00:14:55.590
quote/unquote,
Don Quixote and Sancho at our

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:58.793
own home,
and so they try to make the

00:14:58.793 --> 00:14:59.950
best of it.
 

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.985
Everything in the duke and
duchess's home is like fiction,

00:15:04.985 --> 00:15:08.960
except that fiction can be
harsh and cruel.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.721
What their fiction proves,
the truth of their fiction is

00:15:14.721 --> 00:15:18.284
that reality,
too, is like fiction,

00:15:18.284 --> 00:15:23.210
and that both reality and
fiction can hurt.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.269
Actually, what appears here is
that reality is always reality

00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:29.908
plus the props to create the
fiction;

00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:33.912
it's not reality by itself,
but reality improved by or

00:15:33.912 --> 00:15:35.649
changed by the props.
 

00:15:35.649 --> 00:15:39.288
This is the harshness of
desengaño.

00:15:39.288 --> 00:15:45.251
Not only that being deluded can
be hurtful, and to be un-deluded

00:15:45.251 --> 00:15:49.889
also can be hurtful,
but that the physical process

00:15:49.889 --> 00:15:52.730
may indeed involve injury.
 

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.711
Peter E. Russell,
a distinguished British

00:15:55.711 --> 00:15:58.692
hispanist says,
quote: "The duke and

00:15:58.692 --> 00:16:03.389
duchess are remarkably unfeeling
aristocratic pranksters.

00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:08.715
Some of their jokes involve
causing physical harm to their

00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:10.490
two guests."
 

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.205
You will see that Don Quixote
is scratched by cats,

00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:15.106
that the fall from
Clavileño,

00:16:15.106 --> 00:16:17.658
the horse, is very dangerous,
and so forth.

00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:22.217
He adds, Russell:
"Social satire directed at

00:16:22.217 --> 00:16:27.916
various levels of society is
more prominent in these chapters

00:16:27.916 --> 00:16:31.808
than anywhere else in the
book."

00:16:31.808 --> 00:16:34.274
Now, this is true:
social satire is very,

00:16:34.274 --> 00:16:37.168
very important in these
chapters of the book.

00:16:37.168 --> 00:16:40.239
In addition,
and this is a detail that I

00:16:40.239 --> 00:16:43.860
hope you pick up when you get to
this part,

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.553
if you haven't gotten there
yet, the duke and duchess's

00:16:48.553 --> 00:16:52.899
expensive pleasures are
underwritten by the peasant

00:16:52.899 --> 00:16:57.769
whose son does not want to marry
Dueña Rodriguez's

00:16:57.769 --> 00:17:01.072
daughter,
which is the reason why no

00:17:01.072 --> 00:17:03.870
pressure is put on him by his
master.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.332
Remember, there is this
conflict, another one of these

00:17:06.332 --> 00:17:09.767
conflicts on young people,
this young man has promised to

00:17:09.767 --> 00:17:12.690
marry Dueña Rodriguez's
daughter,

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:15.538
because he has impregnated her,
and so forth,

00:17:15.538 --> 00:17:18.684
and she complains that no
pressure is brought upon this

00:17:18.684 --> 00:17:22.767
young man because his father,
who is a poor peasant within

00:17:22.767 --> 00:17:26.490
the realm controlled by the duke
and duchess,

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.919
lends them money,
lends them money at very

00:17:30.919 --> 00:17:34.878
opportune moments;
that is, when the duke and

00:17:34.878 --> 00:17:37.509
duchess are in dire economic
straits.

00:17:37.509 --> 00:17:41.078
This is a very significant
detail.

00:17:41.078 --> 00:17:46.922
These are not only idle upper
classes, but upper classes in

00:17:46.922 --> 00:17:51.960
hock, that finance their high
living with loans.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:58.828
Since you are readers of
Elliott's Imperial Spain,

00:17:58.828 --> 00:18:04.117
you will no doubt see that it
is easy to draw an analogy

00:18:04.117 --> 00:18:09.887
between the behavior of these
aristocrats and the policies of

00:18:09.887 --> 00:18:14.646
the Spanish crown,
which lives off the shipments

00:18:14.646 --> 00:18:19.478
of precious metals from the New
World and loans from the

00:18:19.478 --> 00:18:23.519
Fugger's,
the German bankers who finance

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:28.834
the expensive pleasures of the
Hapsburgs at their court:

00:18:28.834 --> 00:18:33.661
the building of the palace,
or the Retiro that you may

00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:35.140
still see in Madrid.
 

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:42.011
Velázquez paints these
Hapsburgs hunting and engaging

00:18:42.011 --> 00:18:46.088
in these kinds of pleasures,
too.

00:18:46.088 --> 00:18:49.006
All of that,
or most of that,

00:18:49.006 --> 00:18:54.108
was underwritten by loans from
German bankers,

00:18:54.108 --> 00:19:00.646
so this is all part of the
political site of the 1615

00:19:00.646 --> 00:19:04.944
Quixote,
which I mentioned before,

00:19:04.944 --> 00:19:10.154
is the first political novel,
it's a social satire which may

00:19:10.154 --> 00:19:12.930
involve a political dimension.
 

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:20.247
In this context,
Sancho's social aspirations do

00:19:20.247 --> 00:19:28.519
not appear that outlandish,
in the sense that Cervantes is

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:35.637
showing that the social order
and its hierarchies is crumbling

00:19:35.637 --> 00:19:40.538
when the upper classes are so
corrupt,

00:19:40.538 --> 00:19:45.740
and as is evident in that a
peasant,

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.349
a mere peasant is supporting
these aristocrats in their

00:19:49.349 --> 00:19:50.220
activities.
 

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:55.788
So this is kind of a
topsy-turvy world,

00:19:55.788 --> 00:20:01.145
the social world which bespeaks
of erosion and of crumbling of

00:20:01.145 --> 00:20:05.038
this social order,
and what Cervantes is

00:20:05.038 --> 00:20:10.500
dramatizing here is that a new
order is in the making,

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.369
in which class mobility may
very well be possible,

00:20:14.369 --> 00:20:16.440
class mobility up or down.
 

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.910
We see characters,
like the steward,

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.358
in this household of the duke
and duchess,

00:20:24.358 --> 00:20:28.240
who has enormous power over his
masters,

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.088
and we see Sancho,
of course, elevated,

00:20:33.088 --> 00:20:36.829
even if it is fictional,
to governor of this island,

00:20:36.829 --> 00:20:38.298
finally.
 

00:20:38.298 --> 00:20:43.588
So the second part of the
Quixote reveals,

00:20:43.588 --> 00:20:48.935
as I say, a social order that
is not as stable as it used to

00:20:48.935 --> 00:20:52.351
be,
that is sort of shaking,

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:56.538
and he is giving us very
precise--

00:20:56.538 --> 00:21:01.655
Cervantes is giving us--very
precise financial details about

00:21:01.655 --> 00:21:04.950
this,
through this satire.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:09.354
The kind of financial detail
that you expect to find only in

00:21:09.354 --> 00:21:13.278
nineteenth century novels,
such as Balzac's novel,

00:21:13.278 --> 00:21:17.743
in which, of course,
the financial dealings of the

00:21:17.743 --> 00:21:21.490
characters play a very important
role.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.083
But here, already,
in Cervantes,

00:21:24.083 --> 00:21:28.767
we have these details such as
the fact that the duke gets

00:21:28.767 --> 00:21:31.108
loans from this peasant.
 

00:21:31.108 --> 00:21:33.922
Fiction, as performed at the
duke's house,

00:21:33.922 --> 00:21:37.489
is mirthful and playful,
but also cruel and uncaring,

00:21:37.489 --> 00:21:38.450
as I said.
 

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:43.593
Fiction is also ephemeral and
substantial, like the props that

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:44.690
hold it up.
 

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:48.833
With the duke and duchess,
Don Quixote and Sancho

00:21:48.833 --> 00:21:53.580
temporarily realize their
dreams: Don Quixote is treated

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:58.189
like a great knight,
and Sancho is finally made

00:21:58.189 --> 00:22:02.834
governor of an island,
when Don Quixote enters into

00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:08.198
the duke's palatial summer home
they have prompted already their

00:22:08.198 --> 00:22:13.221
help so that they treat Don
Quixote as a great personage and

00:22:13.221 --> 00:22:17.650
have all kinds of things ready
for his comfort.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:24.470
But these fabrications quickly
disappear.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.779
It is, again,
desengaño:

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:30.276
the truth of fiction is that it
illuminates the fictional

00:22:30.276 --> 00:22:33.340
quality of real life,
or the ephemeral quality of

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.568
real life if you want.
 

00:22:34.568 --> 00:22:45.021
An American hispanist,
Ruth El-Saffar--let me put her

00:22:45.021 --> 00:22:46.430
name.
 

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.063
It's part of the name,
she was married to someone of

00:22:49.063 --> 00:22:49.890
Arabic origin.
 

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:57.838
She died very young, tragically;
she was a Cervantes scholar.

00:22:57.838 --> 00:23:01.806
She writes, quote:
"All of Part II is based

00:23:01.806 --> 00:23:06.278
on the mistaken assumption on
the part of the would-be

00:23:06.278 --> 00:23:11.005
all-controlling character
authors that they can deal with

00:23:11.005 --> 00:23:14.548
a fictional character and
maintain,

00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:18.115
at the same time,
a distance, which allows them

00:23:18.115 --> 00:23:22.300
never to slip into that
fictional world with which they

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.858
plan to entertain themselves.
 

00:23:24.858 --> 00:23:29.030
Like Sansón [continues
El Safar], they are trapped from

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.630
two directions,
they are controlled.

00:23:31.630 --> 00:23:34.354
to some extent,
from within their play by the

00:23:34.354 --> 00:23:37.450
very characters whom they intend
to manipulate,

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.720
and from without by an author
of whom they are unaware,

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:46.910
by whose will and whose hand
all they do is contrived."

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:47.788
Unquote.
 

00:23:47.788 --> 00:23:50.955
As we have seen already in the
case of Sansón Carrasco,

00:23:50.955 --> 00:23:53.551
this controlling author,
that he falls into his own

00:23:53.551 --> 00:23:54.019
trap.
 

00:23:54.019 --> 00:23:59.710
He loses to Don Quixote in this
encounter that they have,

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.594
and we will see,
once and again,

00:24:01.594 --> 00:24:04.928
that the steward,
who is a very clever fellow and

00:24:04.928 --> 00:24:08.891
creates all of these elaborate
pranks does not succeed with

00:24:08.891 --> 00:24:09.778
him, okay?
 

00:24:09.778 --> 00:24:11.910
Eventually they come tumbling
down.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:18.778
So Sansón Carrasco is
the principle internal author,

00:24:18.778 --> 00:24:21.480
as I said, and as we've seen
from the very beginning,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.930
bent on recreating the fiction
of Part I,

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:29.720
but now the duke's house,
the duke's steward,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:32.598
will compete with Sansón
quite favorably.

00:24:32.598 --> 00:24:37.170
He is the creator of elaborate
pranks,

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:41.390
like the island where Sancho
will be governor,

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:45.563
like the pageant in the forest,
about which I will speak very

00:24:45.563 --> 00:24:48.334
soon,
none of which turn out quite as

00:24:48.334 --> 00:24:52.338
he planned them,
and within which he gets caught.

00:24:52.338 --> 00:24:55.230
This steward,
by the way, if you think about

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:59.750
the pageant in the forest,
was not only a clever in

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:03.711
creating these pranks,
but he was also a poet,

00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:07.223
he must have written the lines
that Merlin delivers in this

00:25:07.223 --> 00:25:07.890
pageant.
 

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:14.288
The significance of all of
this, apart from its baroque

00:25:14.288 --> 00:25:17.606
character,
is that Cervantes is

00:25:17.606 --> 00:25:21.182
speculating, as usual,
about his own position

00:25:21.182 --> 00:25:23.480
vis-à-vis his own
fiction,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:28.588
this fiction that seems to be
always getting away from him,

00:25:28.588 --> 00:25:32.890
and this is what the presence
of these internal authors,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.930
who are beset by these problems
of distance and control,

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:43.301
reveals, which is the same kind
of situation in which Master

00:25:43.301 --> 00:25:49.782
Peter finds himself with his
puppet theater with catastrophic

00:25:49.782 --> 00:25:51.078
results.
 

00:25:51.078 --> 00:25:57.848
So, then, one of the early
events that occur at the duke

00:25:57.848 --> 00:26:03.084
and duchess's house is,
I'm sure you noticed,

00:26:03.084 --> 00:26:08.220
is the debate Don Quixote has
with the ecclesiastic.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:17.828
This is a criticism of the
church, not of religion,

00:26:17.828 --> 00:26:23.548
and may also be a commentary on
Spanish politics and the role

00:26:23.548 --> 00:26:27.838
that the clergy is allowed to
play in them.

00:26:27.838 --> 00:26:33.492
So we have, again,
another instance here of this

00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:40.588
social and political criticism
that appears in the novel.

00:26:40.588 --> 00:26:48.678
Don Quixote intimates that the
ecclesiastic is a leech living

00:26:48.678 --> 00:26:54.338
at the expense of the duke and
duchess,

00:26:54.338 --> 00:27:00.236
who in turn live off of the
rich peasant who gives them

00:27:00.236 --> 00:27:01.108
loans.
 

00:27:01.108 --> 00:27:06.426
Don Quixote also tells him that
he speaks without authority

00:27:06.426 --> 00:27:11.262
because he lacks experience,
and accuses him of acting

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:15.890
aggressively because he is
protected by his investiture,

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:20.421
meaning that Don Quixote cannot
challenge him to a fight because

00:27:20.421 --> 00:27:23.964
he is an ecclesiastic,
and therefore he takes

00:27:23.964 --> 00:27:28.328
advantage of that protection to
be able to act with this

00:27:28.328 --> 00:27:29.519
haughtiness.
 

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:34.917
But notice that there is some
truth to what the ecclesiastic

00:27:34.917 --> 00:27:40.223
says to the duke and duchess
about how they're dealing with

00:27:40.223 --> 00:27:43.891
Don Quixote,
encouraging him to go on with

00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:46.950
his insanity about being a
knight-errant.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:51.641
There are no uniformly negative
characters in Cervantes,

00:27:51.641 --> 00:27:56.332
even this very unpleasant
priest is right in some of the

00:27:56.332 --> 00:27:58.380
things that he says.
 

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.786
He ruins the whole dinner,
he's very unpleasant but he

00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:05.000
has--some of the things he
says--are quite true.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.770
Perspectivism,
as we have been seeing

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.109
throughout the semester,
means that no one is in

00:28:11.109 --> 00:28:14.892
possession of the entire truth,
that is, the truth made up of

00:28:14.892 --> 00:28:18.088
the various points of view of
the characters,

00:28:18.088 --> 00:28:22.917
and that they truth may be
spoken by the most unlikely

00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:27.616
people,
even people who are not very

00:28:27.616 --> 00:28:28.970
pleasant.
 

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:31.130
This is a constant in Cervantes.
 

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:35.101
Notice that the debate with the
ecclesiastic is,

00:28:35.101 --> 00:28:38.819
in this case,
we could call it a pre-prandial

00:28:38.819 --> 00:28:42.053
speech;
it's a speech before dinner,

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:44.848
which is ruined,
anyway, by this.

00:28:44.848 --> 00:28:48.284
And that it is,
again, another rewriting of the

00:28:48.284 --> 00:28:52.118
arms and letters speech,
because Don Quixote always

00:28:52.118 --> 00:28:54.920
seems to be able to get to that
topic,

00:28:54.920 --> 00:29:00.223
as he did at the house of Diego
de Miranda when he debated about

00:29:00.223 --> 00:29:03.930
the virtues of poetry and of the
military.

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:11.265
Now, we move on now to episodes
that are quite independent,

00:29:11.265 --> 00:29:18.853
and that seem to build not on
Part I but on previous episodes

00:29:18.853 --> 00:29:20.750
of Part II.
 

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:24.980
It's this fiction issuing from
fiction,

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.488
it's like a telescope that
you're pulling out from within

00:29:28.488 --> 00:29:32.308
itself what is happening in
these episodes that follow now.

00:29:32.308 --> 00:29:34.170
Think of it as that,
a telescope,

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.890
and as you pull it out you are
pulling things from within it,

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.108
and that is the way that these
episodes that I'm going to

00:29:42.108 --> 00:29:44.519
discuss now appear in Part II.
 

00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:47.827
These are very important
episodes, not quite on the level

00:29:47.827 --> 00:29:51.891
of the cave of Montesinos,
but very important and very

00:29:51.891 --> 00:29:56.438
memorable episodes,
and that sort of make a

00:29:56.438 --> 00:30:02.038
coherent unit,
although there will be a return

00:30:02.038 --> 00:30:09.334
to the duke and duchess's house
when Don Quixote is on his way

00:30:09.334 --> 00:30:10.890
back home.
 

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:16.392
So we begin by the episode of
the hunt, and we have here,

00:30:16.392 --> 00:30:21.009
again, this effect of the
receding sequences.

00:30:21.009 --> 00:30:27.991
The episode of the hunt and the
elaborate pageant in the forest

00:30:27.991 --> 00:30:33.059
are games within games,
plays within plays.

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:37.569
What is the hunt?
 

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:41.618
The hunt is a mock war.
 

00:30:41.618 --> 00:30:45.747
Aristocrats no longer
participate in wars,

00:30:45.747 --> 00:30:51.182
as we have been seeing all
along, so they now engage in

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:55.108
mock wars, specifically in
hunting.

00:30:55.108 --> 00:31:00.718
We saw that both Don Quixote
and Don Diego de Miranda are

00:31:00.718 --> 00:31:01.720
hunters.
 

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:06.864
The hunting of the boar
involves strategies that are

00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:12.986
akin to those of a battle,
demanding horsemanship as well

00:31:12.986 --> 00:31:18.740
as a playing of drums and
various horns and trumpets;

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:25.236
much of the ceremonial aspects
of war are reproduced in

00:31:25.236 --> 00:31:26.440
hunting.
 

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:33.538
War has become a sport,
and sports, modern sports,

00:31:33.538 --> 00:31:36.578
too, are mock wars.
 

00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:41.779
Think for a moment of American
football,

00:31:41.779 --> 00:31:45.837
which is--the metaphor of war,
is very crass in American

00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:49.896
football: I invade your
territory whereas the other team

00:31:49.896 --> 00:31:53.103
defends his territory,
and so there is a dividing

00:31:53.103 --> 00:31:55.996
line, which is like the frontier
between these two countries at

00:31:55.996 --> 00:31:59.787
war,
and all of the terminology is

00:31:59.787 --> 00:32:02.970
derived from the military.
 

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.670
All of this what I call back
and forth sports,

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:10.509
hockey, soccer,
football, lacrosse,

00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:12.746
are back and forth,
because you stand there and

00:32:12.746 --> 00:32:15.952
they go back and forth,
back and forth,

00:32:15.952 --> 00:32:19.838
are a crass metaphor for war.
 

00:32:19.838 --> 00:32:25.262
If a Martian got off his
spaceship and you took him to a

00:32:25.262 --> 00:32:29.491
football game,
the Martian would be able to

00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:33.140
understand very soon what is
going on,

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:37.336
not so with baseball,
by the way, but in baseball the

00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:42.178
war metaphor is very elaborate:
you run around the bases in a

00:32:42.178 --> 00:32:46.410
circle to come back home,
like Ulysses, and all of that.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:52.328
Yes, yes, this is not just a
defense of baseball,

00:32:52.328 --> 00:32:55.034
because as you know I've
written quite a bit on baseball

00:32:55.034 --> 00:32:58.720
and played the game a lot,
but it is simply the truth.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.450
These other sports that I've
mentioned and hunting,

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.509
of course, are crass metaphors
for war.

00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:08.872
In baseball,
the metaphor is more--it's

00:33:08.872 --> 00:33:12.587
baroque, actually,
it's that convoluted and

00:33:12.587 --> 00:33:13.650
distant.
 

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:18.983
But the outcome,
of course, of sports contests

00:33:18.983 --> 00:33:23.488
are like wars,
I think it's tomorrow,

00:33:23.488 --> 00:33:27.146
the New York Yankees,
who have just won the World

00:33:27.146 --> 00:33:29.950
Series,
last night, are going to be

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:33.490
paraded down the streets of New
York,

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.997
with ticker tapes,
as if they had been returning

00:33:36.997 --> 00:33:41.398
heroes like those in Rome who
came back and built arches and

00:33:41.398 --> 00:33:42.368
so forth.
 

00:33:42.368 --> 00:33:46.309
So much for sports,
but I want to underline the

00:33:46.309 --> 00:33:51.364
fact that hunting has become a
sport, and this is what these

00:33:51.364 --> 00:33:54.019
aristocrats are engaged in.
 

00:33:54.019 --> 00:33:58.010
Sancho, of course,
runs up the tree scared by this

00:33:58.010 --> 00:34:03.142
boar which--these are dangerous
animals with the long tusks like

00:34:03.142 --> 00:34:05.259
this, and all of that.
 

00:34:05.259 --> 00:34:11.429
Now, as in Camacho's wedding,
notice the transition,

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:16.679
the episode of the whole
pageant in the forest,

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:20.648
begins with a killed animal,
as if a scapegoat were needed

00:34:20.648 --> 00:34:23.936
to start the action,
and also a scapegoat were

00:34:23.936 --> 00:34:25.420
needed for the feast.
 

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:32.094
Feast ceremonies and parties
seem to demand a scapegoat of

00:34:32.094 --> 00:34:33.500
some sort.
 

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.230
It doesn't have to be a goat,
of course,

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.860
it can be a turkey,
at Thanksgiving,

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:41.226
and so forth,
or it could be a pig in many

00:34:41.226 --> 00:34:45.297
celebrations,
but it seems to be an atavistic

00:34:45.297 --> 00:34:49.039
need of the human race to have
these scapegoats.

00:34:49.039 --> 00:34:54.550
There have been recent
instances in Spain,

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.969
I have seen it discussed in the
newspapers,

00:34:57.969 --> 00:35:01.260
where new traditions of this
kind have emerged,

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.204
and the towns have the practice
that when they have their big

00:35:03.204 --> 00:35:05.277
feast they take a goat up on the
church steeple and throw him off

00:35:05.277 --> 00:35:06.119
and kill him that way.
 

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:15.969
Gross.
 

00:35:15.969 --> 00:35:19.422
But what I'm underlining is at
the beginning,

00:35:19.422 --> 00:35:23.579
the killing of this boar here
has sort of an atavistic

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:25.619
ritualistic air to it.
 

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:30.688
Now, this pageant in the forest
is one of the most baroque

00:35:30.688 --> 00:35:34.780
episodes in the whole of the
Quixote.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:40.378
The episode gathers elements of
the cave of Montesinos and the

00:35:40.378 --> 00:35:43.590
wagon of the parliament of
death;

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.268
it is a kind of synthesis of
both.

00:35:46.268 --> 00:35:49.574
This is what I meant by
episodes that are derived from

00:35:49.574 --> 00:35:52.880
episodes like a telescope that
you open like that,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:36:01.050
but it also a version,
or more accurately,

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:05.543
a perversion of a certain
moment in Dante's

00:36:05.543 --> 00:36:10.882
Purgatorio,
and I gave you a handout in the

00:36:10.882 --> 00:36:16.768
previous class with a fragment
of Purgatorio XXIX,

00:36:16.768 --> 00:36:23.739
because these episodes here,
as I will describe in some

00:36:23.739 --> 00:36:26.445
detail,
are a take of,

00:36:26.445 --> 00:36:32.007
a parody, of these episodes in
the Divine Comedy,

00:36:32.007 --> 00:36:33.119
no less.
 

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:37.889
I told you that,
now, Cervantes' sources are not

00:36:37.889 --> 00:36:42.559
just the romances of chivalry
but Ovid, Virgil,

00:36:42.559 --> 00:36:44.590
Homer and Dante.
 

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.393
Now, in Dante's Commedia
this is a moment of

00:36:48.393 --> 00:36:50.827
anagnorisis,
of discovery,

00:36:50.827 --> 00:36:53.719
of self discovery for the
pilgrim.

00:36:53.719 --> 00:36:59.132
The pilgrim poet is left by
Virgil who has guided him up to

00:36:59.132 --> 00:37:02.402
this point,
and who will not be able to

00:37:02.402 --> 00:37:05.239
enter paradise because he is a
pagan,

00:37:05.239 --> 00:37:09.210
so he is left--the pilgrim is
left--

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.079
on his own to meet Beatrice.
 

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:15.552
Virgil dwells in limbo at the
entrance of Inferno,

00:37:15.552 --> 00:37:20.755
where he is lodged with other
worthies of the pagan world,

00:37:20.755 --> 00:37:23.860
neither punished nor rewarded.
 

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:27.760
This is a marvelous invention
of Dante's limbo,

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.550
where he puts all of these
great figures of antiquity who

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.596
could not--
since they came before Christ,

00:37:33.596 --> 00:37:35.923
could not have been Christian,
therefore, they cannot enter

00:37:35.923 --> 00:37:38.251
paradise,
and they're put here in limbo

00:37:38.251 --> 00:37:40.940
where they are together in this
palace,

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:46.800
neither too happy nor sad,
with a kind of a smile,

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.454
a mysterious smile on their
face discussing their works with

00:37:50.454 --> 00:37:51.260
each other.
 

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:52.699
It's a kind of a perpetual
seminar...

00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:54.539
Not bad.
 

00:37:54.539 --> 00:38:00.302
That's where Virgil dwells,
and he left to accompany the

00:38:00.302 --> 00:38:05.960
pilgrim all the way up,
but not quite into paradise.

00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:09.329
Of course, the whole object of
the journey was to find

00:38:09.329 --> 00:38:10.030
Beatrice.
 

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:17.202
The pilgrim moves on to the end
of Purgatorio to be met

00:38:17.202 --> 00:38:18.849
by Beatrice.
 

00:38:18.849 --> 00:38:26.530
I will get to the solemn
procession that meets him,

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.090
and on which the one in
Cervantes is based,

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:33.360
but first let me tell you that
the meeting with Beatrice is,

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.250
to me, one of the funniest
moments in the whole of the

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:39.380
western literary tradition.
 

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:47.007
After the pilgrim poet has gone
through all of hell and most of

00:38:47.007 --> 00:38:53.432
purgatory in order to meet her,
the first thing that Beatrice

00:38:53.432 --> 00:38:57.764
does when they do meet is to
reproach him for having been

00:38:57.764 --> 00:39:00.550
with other women after his
death.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:06.554
I find this delicious and very,
very funny and a great lesson:

00:39:06.554 --> 00:39:10.000
no good deed shall go
unpunished.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.211
But what ensues in Dante is an
elaborate procession as Beatrice

00:39:17.211 --> 00:39:23.610
appeared: at its front there
march seven luminaries,

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:27.768
the seven gifts of the Holy
Ghost, followed by the twenty

00:39:27.768 --> 00:39:31.800
elders of the Apocalypse,
canticles announce the

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.693
impending arrival of Beatrice,
four mystic animals appear,

00:39:36.693 --> 00:39:41.239
the four gospels,
and a cart pulled by a griffin;

00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:44.931
the four cardinal virtues
follow and then the three

00:39:44.931 --> 00:39:48.697
theological virtues with Saint
Peter and Saint Paul,

00:39:48.697 --> 00:39:51.206
four doctors of the Church,
and St.

00:39:51.206 --> 00:39:52.018
John.
 

00:39:52.018 --> 00:39:55.260
The procession stops before the
pilgrim poet;

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:58.393
the triumphant Beatrice,
symbol of theology,

00:39:58.393 --> 00:40:00.070
makes her appearance.
 

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:04.108
This is the background of the
pageant that the steward has

00:40:04.108 --> 00:40:08.077
organized with the help of other
servants of the duke and

00:40:08.077 --> 00:40:11.239
duchess,
including the beautiful page

00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:13.639
playing the role of Dulcinea.
 

00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:19.079
One must pause to ponder,
at least I pause to ponder,

00:40:19.079 --> 00:40:22.742
the distance between the
universe created by Dante in

00:40:22.742 --> 00:40:26.688
the Divine Comedy and
that created by Cervantes in

00:40:26.688 --> 00:40:28.309
the Quixote.
 

00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:32.757
The pageant in the forest is
quite a bold parody,

00:40:32.757 --> 00:40:37.760
verging on the irreverent,
on the part of Cervantes.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.128
What makes the difference
between Dante's and Cervantes'

00:40:43.128 --> 00:40:43.909
world?
 

00:40:43.909 --> 00:40:46.699
This is what we must ask
ourselves at this point.

00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:51.490
In my view, is the progressive
crumbling of the certainties of

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.994
the medieval world,
the cosmology grounded on the

00:40:54.994 --> 00:40:58.603
Ptolemaic system that has been
shattered by the discovery of

00:40:58.603 --> 00:41:01.539
the New World and the Copernican
revolution,

00:41:01.539 --> 00:41:05.840
the Protestant Reformation and
the schism in the Christian

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.518
Church.
 

00:41:06.518 --> 00:41:11.876
The minutely ordered symbolic
universe of Christian doctrine

00:41:11.876 --> 00:41:17.507
apparent in medieval cathedrals
and in the Divine Comedy

00:41:17.507 --> 00:41:19.960
is no longer available.
 

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:24.760
The fusion of Neo-Platonic love
and its courtly derivatives,

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.630
which could coalesce in the
figure of Beatrice uniting

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.768
worldly love with divine love
and faith,

00:41:31.768 --> 00:41:37.036
has been torn asunder,
so that, what Don Quixote finds

00:41:37.036 --> 00:41:41.510
in this brilliant scene is not a
Beatrice,

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:46.929
but is a transvestite Dulcinea,
a transvestite Dulcinea,

00:41:46.929 --> 00:41:51.197
no less, who reveals to him
perhaps the depths of his

00:41:51.197 --> 00:41:54.809
madness and the true nature of
his desire.

00:41:54.809 --> 00:41:58.094
Javier Herrero,
whom I have quoted many times

00:41:58.094 --> 00:42:02.050
in the course of the semester,
says the following:

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:07.206
"It is a remarkable twist
of Cervantes' irony that the

00:42:07.206 --> 00:42:12.628
incarnated Dulcinea is a lie of
the duke's built on a previous

00:42:12.628 --> 00:42:14.230
lie of Sancho.
 

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:17.547
To top it all,
Dulcinea is really a man,

00:42:17.547 --> 00:42:22.396
a page of the duke's that the
steward has selected to play

00:42:22.396 --> 00:42:25.460
this role because of his beauty.
 

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.052
Such is the ontological status
of the earthly Dulcinea,

00:42:29.052 --> 00:42:32.447
a labyrinth of lies built upon
lies of contradictory

00:42:32.447 --> 00:42:33.643
appearances."
 

00:42:33.643 --> 00:42:34.510
Unquote.
 

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:38.154
Think about this,
think about the difference

00:42:38.154 --> 00:42:41.289
between Beatrice and this
Dulcinea.

00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:46.289
I mean, it's a huge difference,
I mean,

00:42:46.289 --> 00:42:53.277
between the sublime image of
Beatrice who incarnates theology

00:42:53.277 --> 00:43:00.150
in the Divine Comedy and
this hilarious figure of the

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:04.291
duke's page,
who is very beautiful,

00:43:04.291 --> 00:43:07.239
playing the role of Dulcinea.
 

00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:13.583
This is the evolution of the
ideal woman from Dante to

00:43:13.583 --> 00:43:17.065
Cervantes,
which goes through Laura in

00:43:17.065 --> 00:43:20.440
Petrarch,
Isabel Freyre in Garcilaso,

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.815
and all of these winds up in
this brilliant figure of the

00:43:25.815 --> 00:43:30.039
transvestite Dulcinea that we
have here,

00:43:30.039 --> 00:43:32.329
in this pageant in the forest.
 

00:43:32.329 --> 00:43:37.701
I mean, this is where Cervantes
reaches levels of penetration

00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:42.445
into the evolution of the
western mind that are really

00:43:42.445 --> 00:43:46.190
uncanny,
and where we have not really

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.849
gone much beyond.
 

00:43:47.849 --> 00:43:56.824
Now, the pageant in the forest
is bristling with Baroque

00:43:56.824 --> 00:43:59.757
elements;
it is the most Baroque scene in

00:43:59.757 --> 00:44:00.420
the entire novel.
 

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.889
First, it takes place in a
chiaroscuro atmosphere,

00:44:03.889 --> 00:44:06.539
and I've explained what
chiaroscuro is,

00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:09.396
as we shall see,
a darkness that is half

00:44:09.396 --> 00:44:11.230
illuminated by torches.
 

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:13.641
It is a fabrication,
a construction,

00:44:13.641 --> 00:44:16.880
an assemblage of disparate
elements: theatrical,

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.880
self conscious,
humorous.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.706
It is play and it is a play;
the carts that appear carrying

00:44:23.706 --> 00:44:27.463
the costumed players are like
those used to represent autos

00:44:27.463 --> 00:44:29.981
sacramentales--
remember those allegorical

00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:32.260
autos that I have
mentioned several times,

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:35.969
like the one in the wagon of
the parliament of death episode.

00:44:35.969 --> 00:44:39.684
As in much of the second part,
these are complicated

00:44:39.684 --> 00:44:42.380
"burlas,"
pranks,

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:46.496
based on literary allusions,
like the cave of Montesinos

00:44:46.496 --> 00:44:48.905
episode,
which drew from the classical

00:44:48.905 --> 00:44:51.150
tradition and the romances of
chivalry--

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:56.239
remember the descent to Hades
in Homer and Virgil and one in

00:44:56.239 --> 00:44:58.570
the romances of chivalry.
 

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:01.619
Here, in this pageant in the
forest we have,

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:03.889
as in the cave,
literary figures,

00:45:03.889 --> 00:45:07.789
like Merlin and the Devil,
representing themselves.

00:45:07.789 --> 00:45:11.307
That is, you think that a
literary figure represents

00:45:11.307 --> 00:45:14.632
presumably a real person,
but here these are literary

00:45:14.632 --> 00:45:17.059
figures who are representing
literary figures;

00:45:17.059 --> 00:45:20.670
these are several layers of
fictionality here.

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:25.349
It is literally a dantesque
world with clear allusions,

00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:28.643
as I've mentioned,
to Purgatorio

00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:31.590
XXVIII-XXX; XXVIII,
XXIX, XXX.

00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.043
Baroque art is,
we call it in Spanish,

00:45:34.043 --> 00:45:39.152
"efectista";
it aims at generating reactions

00:45:39.152 --> 00:45:43.029
on the audience of--
because of its outrageous

00:45:43.029 --> 00:45:47.443
dimensions or its exaggerated
qualities: that's the essence of

00:45:47.443 --> 00:45:48.530
the Baroque.
 

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:52.023
The reader is treated to the
effects of this art and shown

00:45:52.023 --> 00:45:55.090
its effects on the spectators
and participants,

00:45:55.090 --> 00:45:58.385
like Sancho,
who faints, and also,

00:45:58.385 --> 00:46:04.081
its effect even on those who
are responsible for the whole

00:46:04.081 --> 00:46:06.864
charade;
they are caught within their

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:09.750
own fiction, the duke and
duchess, and are scared.

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:16.460
The most jarring effect in this
episode is caused by sound and

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:22.264
if we turn to pages 695,
696, I'm going to read a

00:46:22.264 --> 00:46:27.460
passage that begins in the last
paragraph:

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:32.018
"With these and the like
entertaining discourses,

00:46:32.018 --> 00:46:35.603
they left the tent,
and went into the wood to visit

00:46:35.603 --> 00:46:39.690
the toils and nets [this was in
the world of the hunt].

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:44.746
The day was soon spent,
and night came on not so clear

00:46:44.746 --> 00:46:48.659
nor so calm as the season of the
year,

00:46:48.659 --> 00:46:51.389
which was the midst of summer,
required,

00:46:51.389 --> 00:46:53.389
but a kind of clair
obscur [chiaroscuro,

00:46:53.389 --> 00:46:56.239
this is what Jarvis is trying
to get at],

00:46:56.239 --> 00:46:59.956
which contributed very much to
help forward the duke and

00:46:59.956 --> 00:47:01.239
duchess's design.
 

00:47:01.239 --> 00:47:04.737
Now, night coming on,
soon after the twilight,

00:47:04.737 --> 00:47:09.168
on the sudden the wood seemed
on fire from all of the four

00:47:09.168 --> 00:47:12.630
quarters;
and presently were heard,

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.675
on all sides,
an infinite number of cornets

00:47:15.675 --> 00:47:19.686
and other instruments of war,
as if a great body of horse was

00:47:19.686 --> 00:47:21.639
passing through the wood.
 

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:24.577
The blaze of the fire,
and the sound of the warlike

00:47:24.577 --> 00:47:27.536
instruments,
almost blinded and stunned the

00:47:27.536 --> 00:47:32.041
eyes and ears of the bystanders,
and even of all that were in

00:47:32.041 --> 00:47:32.809
the wood.
 

00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:37.335
Presently were heard infinite
Lelilelies [which is a sound

00:47:37.335 --> 00:47:41.623
that the Moors make when they
are just going to battle]

00:47:41.623 --> 00:47:42.179
...
 

00:47:42.179 --> 00:47:46.320
Trumpets and clarions sounded,
drums beat,

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.380
fifes played,
and almost all at once,

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.740
so fast and without
intermission,

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:55.067
that he must have had no sense,
who had not lost at the

00:47:55.067 --> 00:47:58.070
confused din so many
instruments."

00:47:58.070 --> 00:47:58.940
Unquote.
 

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.436
The "son
confuso,"

00:48:00.436 --> 00:48:01.554
confused sound,
causes

00:48:01.554 --> 00:48:03.510
"pasmo,"
that is,

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.304
astonishment,
"suspenso,"

00:48:05.304 --> 00:48:06.632
suspense,
"admirac

00:48:06.632 --> 00:48:08.391
ión,"
admiration and

00:48:08.391 --> 00:48:10.300
"espanto,"
fright.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.719
I'm quoting words from the
original.

00:48:12.719 --> 00:48:16.590
The key here is the shrill,
disharmony;

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.677
the sounds are:
"ronco,"

00:48:18.677 --> 00:48:21.206
hoarse, and
"espantoso,"

00:48:21.206 --> 00:48:22.219
frightening.
 

00:48:22.219 --> 00:48:24.739
The voices, "horr&amp;ia
cute;sona"

00:48:24.739 --> 00:48:26.454
horrible;
the devil is sounding a

00:48:26.454 --> 00:48:28.213
"desaforado
cuerno,"

00:48:28.213 --> 00:48:29.289
an outrageous horn.
 

00:48:29.289 --> 00:48:32.190
They are visual effects, too.
 

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:34.304
The devils are ugly:
those "feos

00:48:34.304 --> 00:48:36.853
demonios,"
and Merlin, as the figure of

00:48:36.853 --> 00:48:38.210
death, is terrifying.
 

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:42.666
This whole scene is cast in
this clash of sounds and sights

00:48:42.666 --> 00:48:45.280
artificially created for effect.
 

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.230
Even in the translation that I
have just read,

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:52.614
you can hear that Cervantes has
created this effect also

00:48:52.614 --> 00:48:56.626
stylistically,
with harsh sounding words and

00:48:56.626 --> 00:48:59.456
onomatopoeias;
that is, is words that sound

00:48:59.456 --> 00:49:00.809
like what they represent.
 

00:49:00.809 --> 00:49:07.375
Now, in addition to all of this
Baroque atmosphere,

00:49:07.375 --> 00:49:13.809
Dulcinea is a transvestite,
I get back to that.

00:49:13.809 --> 00:49:16.920
Dulcinea is a man disguised as
a beautiful woman,

00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:19.900
more precisely,
a beautiful young man disguised

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:24.030
as a beautiful young woman;
it is underlined that the page

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.018
is beautiful.
 

00:49:25.018 --> 00:49:29.523
This is the most outrageous of
the transformations that

00:49:29.523 --> 00:49:33.235
Dulcinea undergoes,
even worse than her appearing

00:49:33.235 --> 00:49:37.181
as a peasant wench smelling of
garlic: it makes her femininity

00:49:37.181 --> 00:49:40.947
something artificial,
that can be forged with the

00:49:40.947 --> 00:49:42.300
proper disguise.
 

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:46.818
The transvestite is a common
Baroque figure in Spanish

00:49:46.818 --> 00:49:51.251
literature, because in the
Baroque even gender can be

00:49:51.251 --> 00:49:53.639
constructed, fabricated.
 

00:49:53.639 --> 00:49:57.594
From the ideal beauty drawn
from the Neo-Platonic and the

00:49:57.594 --> 00:50:01.266
courtly love tradition from
which Don Quixote invents

00:50:01.266 --> 00:50:05.222
Dulcinea to the grotesque
peasant of Sancho's lie to this

00:50:05.222 --> 00:50:09.175
Baroque construction there is an
increase in the level of

00:50:09.175 --> 00:50:13.559
fabrication,
of artificiality.

00:50:13.559 --> 00:50:18.630
I guess we do invent the
objects of our desires;

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:20.050
this is what the novel keeps
telling us.

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.835
You've got to be careful,
you don't invent the object of

00:50:22.835 --> 00:50:25.518
your desire, and it turns out to
be a transvestite.

00:50:25.518 --> 00:50:35.690
I have seen some that can
really fool anybody.

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:39.192
I wrote a book on a Cuban
writer called Severo Sarduy,

00:50:39.192 --> 00:50:41.768
whose chief figure is a
transvestite;

00:50:41.768 --> 00:50:47.135
he lived in Paris and I visited
with him a few places that are

00:50:47.135 --> 00:50:51.358
not in the tour's guides and
where you would find

00:50:51.358 --> 00:50:55.670
transvestites that could really
fool anybody.

00:50:55.670 --> 00:51:03.237
The grotesqueness is augmented
here and made even funnier by

00:51:03.237 --> 00:51:09.266
the feature that exposes
Dulcinea's true gender,

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:11.190
which is...
 

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.268
her voice!
 

00:51:13.268 --> 00:51:20.230
Jarvis flubs the translation,
our Jarvis.

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:24.260
In the original it says that
Dulcinea's voice was not very

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:28.222
"adamada,"
from "dama,"

00:51:28.222 --> 00:51:30.739
lady,
"adamada."

00:51:30.739 --> 00:51:33.079
The voice was not very
lady-like.

00:51:33.079 --> 00:51:38.157
Jarvis renders it as
"amiable,"

00:51:38.157 --> 00:51:41.967
oh, he ruins the whole effect.
 

00:51:41.967 --> 00:51:42.730
No!
 

00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:44.250
Dulcinea's voice is masculine.
 

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.681
She has a voice,
and when she delivers the

00:51:46.681 --> 00:51:49.469
speech the contrast is that
she's beautiful,

00:51:49.469 --> 00:51:51.740
because the page is beautiful
and dressed like a beautiful

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.514
woman,
but suddenly,

00:51:53.514 --> 00:51:59.070
what emerges from her is a
hoarse voice of a male.

00:51:59.070 --> 00:52:03.992
She has too much testosterone
and this contrast,

00:52:03.992 --> 00:52:10.068
this clash is what is important
here, and lamentably Jarvis

00:52:10.068 --> 00:52:11.639
flubbed it.
 

00:52:11.639 --> 00:52:15.101
This whole episode makes me
think of a movie that is perhaps

00:52:15.101 --> 00:52:18.798
too old for you to have seen it
but it's such a classic that you

00:52:18.798 --> 00:52:21.855
may have seen it,
Some Like It Hot,

00:52:21.855 --> 00:52:23.400
with Marilyn Monroe.
 

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.324
It's just a wonderful movie,
and the very last line is a

00:52:27.324 --> 00:52:30.789
classic,
because, when the old man

00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:34.969
is--just continues to insist
that he,

00:52:34.969 --> 00:52:39.050
Lemon--is the--is Lemon the
guy..?--

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:45.639
who is playing the transvestite
finally his defense is,

00:52:45.639 --> 00:52:48.110
"But I'm not even a
woman!,"

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.382
and then, of course,
"Nobody's perfect,"

00:52:51.382 --> 00:52:54.378
answers her eager lover,
and, I guess,

00:52:54.378 --> 00:52:58.282
this Dulcinea is not perfect;
I mean, first of all,

00:52:58.282 --> 00:52:59.190
she's a man.
 

00:52:59.190 --> 00:53:03.621
She may be beautiful,
and in addition to that,

00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:08.449
she has a voice that is just
not very feminine.

00:53:08.449 --> 00:53:13.460
This whole elaborate prank is
concocted to disenchant

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:14.518
Dulcinea.
 

00:53:14.518 --> 00:53:19.460
To bring her out of the state
in which Sancho's lie put her,

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:23.989
hence the need,
within this grotesque fiction,

00:53:23.989 --> 00:53:27.811
for Sancho to punish himself,
by giving himself three

00:53:27.811 --> 00:53:30.309
thousand lashes on his buttocks.
 

00:53:30.309 --> 00:53:35.693
The prank has a logic of its
own which operates at the level

00:53:35.693 --> 00:53:40.530
of the lies, which are fictions
in their own right.

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:43.230
At that level Sancho is the
culprit, so he must pay the

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:43.630
price.
 

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:49.639
Now, but why lashes on his butt
and not his back?

00:53:49.639 --> 00:53:53.369
Which is, traditionally,
prisoners are punished by

00:53:53.369 --> 00:53:57.251
having a number of lashes
administered to their bare

00:53:57.251 --> 00:54:00.599
backs, but here it's to his bare
bottom.

00:54:00.599 --> 00:54:04.543
This, of course,
adds to the humor of the whole

00:54:04.543 --> 00:54:09.257
charade, because Sancho,
of course, wants to protect his

00:54:09.257 --> 00:54:10.030
butt.
 

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:12.291
Literally, he's not going to
have any such thing happen to

00:54:12.291 --> 00:54:12.530
him.
 

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:16.516
But, of course,
it is an allusion to Sancho's

00:54:16.516 --> 00:54:20.320
being so dependent on his
digestive system,

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:21.679
as it were.
 

00:54:21.679 --> 00:54:24.929
He has already defecated twice
in the novel--

00:54:24.929 --> 00:54:27.659
remember, in Part I,
in the fulling hammers,

00:54:27.659 --> 00:54:30.811
and then when he takes that
concoction that Don Quixote

00:54:30.811 --> 00:54:33.789
gives him and he has a terrible
bout of diarrhea;

00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:38.969
so defecation and the year end
are very much a part of Sancho.

00:54:38.969 --> 00:54:45.184
His rear, Sancho's rear
represents his fleshy character,

00:54:45.184 --> 00:54:51.849
it is his signature as much as
his belly is in the last name

00:54:51.849 --> 00:54:52.980
Panza.
 

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:57.809
A finale on the duke and
duchess: Joaquín

00:54:57.809 --> 00:55:02.617
Casalduero,
a Spanish hispanist from the

00:55:02.617 --> 00:55:08.795
forties,
says at the duke's house,

00:55:08.795 --> 00:55:21.730
Don Quixote feels for the first
time like a real knight-errant,

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:23.780
but that this is not enough.
 

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.679
And this is the quote from
Casalduero, translated by me:

00:55:26.679 --> 00:55:33.780
"Man's inner reality seeks
to be confirmed in society,

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:36.489
which when it gratifies the man
of action,

00:55:36.489 --> 00:55:41.779
grants him a personality,
but any social confirmation of

00:55:41.779 --> 00:55:45.530
what is spiritual is always a
parody.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:47.362
Don Quixote,
a spiritual man,

00:55:47.362 --> 00:55:49.784
sees his own image as a
knight-errant,

00:55:49.784 --> 00:55:53.648
which he has heretofore always
contemplated in the purity of

00:55:53.648 --> 00:55:54.500
action.
 

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.380
It is an image of his external
self,

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.436
the honor, social status,
the fame that society can grant

00:56:01.436 --> 00:56:05.567
the man of the spirit are
nothing but a burlesque image of

00:56:05.567 --> 00:56:08.197
him,
a distortion of his inner

00:56:08.197 --> 00:56:09.860
life." Unquote.
 

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:13.840
Casalduero posits that any
manifestation of one's inner

00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:18.340
life in the world outside has
necessarily to be burlesque,

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.340
that it cannot match its
essence in the purity of thought

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.268
and desire.
 

00:56:23.268 --> 00:56:27.329
Perhaps Don Quixote is making
this discovery,

00:56:27.329 --> 00:56:31.396
as he is subject to pranks,
like those he suffers at the

00:56:31.396 --> 00:56:35.389
hands of the duke and the
duchess and their minions.

00:56:35.389 --> 00:56:39.056
Now, I want to end with a few
words about The Pretended

00:56:39.056 --> 00:56:41.659
Aunt,
because you have written a

00:56:41.659 --> 00:56:47.443
paper to be turned in today,
in which following Auerbach and

00:56:47.443 --> 00:56:52.420
Spitzer on the notion of the
Cervantean,

00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.518
using that knowledge you apply
it to your reading of The

00:56:56.518 --> 00:57:00.757
Pretended Aunt and try to
decide if it was written or not

00:57:00.757 --> 00:57:01.960
by Cervantes.
 

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.175
This is a story that appeared
in a bundle of manuscripts that

00:57:06.175 --> 00:57:10.108
included some of Cervantes'
stories like Rinconete and

00:57:10.108 --> 00:57:13.059
Cortadillo, but it was not
signed.

00:57:13.059 --> 00:57:16.429
And, of course,
the debate has raged over the

00:57:16.429 --> 00:57:21.099
centuries as to whether it was
written by Cervantes or not.

00:57:21.099 --> 00:57:25.030
In favor of considering the
story to be Cervantes I would

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:28.608
say that Esperanza is an
independent young woman who

00:57:28.608 --> 00:57:32.400
shapes her future by dint of her
will and courage;

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:36.309
she rebels and winds up married
to a well-to-do young man;

00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:40.427
she erases her past as a whore
and becomes respectable and

00:57:40.427 --> 00:57:41.150
married.
 

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:43.679
In this, she is like other
Cervantes characters,

00:57:43.679 --> 00:57:45.398
like Marcela,
Dorotea and Zoraida,

00:57:45.398 --> 00:57:49.173
and also in favor of--
the story ends with an unequal

00:57:49.173 --> 00:57:52.119
marriage similar to those in
the,

00:57:52.119 --> 00:57:54.320
a successful one at that.
 

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:59.518
Against it being by Cervantes,
is the strong,

00:57:59.518 --> 00:58:02.869
too strong influence of
Celestina,

00:58:02.869 --> 00:58:08.568
above all in the salacious
episodes and details about

00:58:08.568 --> 00:58:10.760
repairing virgins.
 

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:14.389
There is nothing quite as dirty
in any text by Cervantes,

00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:17.320
including The Deceitful
Marriage and The Dogs

00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:19.130
Colloquy,
stories that you will be

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:20.739
reading towards the end of the
semester.

00:58:20.739 --> 00:58:25.237
It could be--a way out could
be--is that, it could be by an

00:58:25.237 --> 00:58:28.960
early Cervantes story before he
was Cervantes;

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:33.025
it could be a Cervantes
imitator who wrote it and so

00:58:33.025 --> 00:58:37.887
forth, but how many of you here
thought that it was written by

00:58:37.887 --> 00:58:40.440
Cervantes, raise your hands?
 

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.179
One, two, three, four.
 

00:58:44.179 --> 00:58:46.369
How many thought not?
 

00:58:46.369 --> 00:58:50.809
How many didn't take a side?
 

00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:53.150
You didn't take any sides?
 

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:56.150
Student: 
&gt;

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:58.559
Prof: Not fair.
 

00:58:58.559 --> 00:58:59.369
Okay.
 

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:04.000

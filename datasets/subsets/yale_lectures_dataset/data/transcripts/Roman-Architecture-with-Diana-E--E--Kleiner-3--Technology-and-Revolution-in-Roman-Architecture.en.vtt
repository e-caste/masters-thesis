00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.160
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.430
It's Inauguration Day--Happy
Inauguration Day to everyone--

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.932
and I thought that actually the
inauguration of Barack Obama

00:00:12.932 --> 00:00:17.435
today and the particular lecture
in this class are very well

00:00:17.435 --> 00:00:19.420
suited to one another.
 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.225
Because although you see that
the title of today's lecture is

00:00:23.225 --> 00:00:26.396
"Technology and Revolution
in Roman Art,"

00:00:26.396 --> 00:00:30.327
I could also call it something
like "The Change the Romans

00:00:30.327 --> 00:00:31.850
Believed In."
 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.570
Because the change the Romans
believed in,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.617
the change the Romans believed
in was a shift from what we call

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:43.606
traditional Roman architecture
to innovative Roman

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:44.990
architecture.
 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.980
And that's what we're going to
be talking about today,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.005
what we call innovative,
and what we'll call in the

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.020
course of this semester,
innovative Roman architecture.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.988
We've already talked about what
we've called traditional Roman

00:00:56.988 --> 00:00:59.523
architecture,
and I just want to look again

00:00:59.523 --> 00:01:03.354
with you,
to begin today with the Temple

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:06.325
of Portunus,
that we looked at last time,

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:09.299
the Temple of Portunus in Rome,
near the Tiber River,

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.079
a temple that was put up in the
late second,

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.780
early first century B.C.
 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.870
And we talked about the fact
that this was a traditional

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.500
Roman building of this day.
 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.918
A traditional Roman building
though that was quite

00:01:20.918 --> 00:01:23.034
derivative,
that looked back at Greek

00:01:23.034 --> 00:01:25.664
architecture,
Greek religious architecture,

00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:27.989
and Etruscan religious
architecture,

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:30.757
and drew from both of those,
drew elements from both of

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.924
those,
and combined them together into

00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.239
what we termed a new Roman
creation,

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:39.230
at least in the traditional
vein.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.920
We talked about the fact that
the Etruscan elements of this

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.720
particular monument were its
tall podium,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.941
were its deep porch,
were the freestanding columns

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:52.527
in that porch,
were the single staircase and

00:01:52.527 --> 00:01:55.590
the emphasis on the
faÃ§ade,

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.550
that having that single
staircase achieved.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.352
We also talked about the fact
that while there were columns

00:02:02.352 --> 00:02:07.120
all around the structure,
which is actually a Greek way

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.507
of doing things,
that those columns were

00:02:10.507 --> 00:02:12.960
attached or engaged into the
wall,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.840
which still gave it a certain
sense of flatness,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.046
including on the back,
that was also characteristic of

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:20.500
Etruscan architecture.
 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.991
We also talked about the Greek
elements that were incorporated

00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:26.073
here,
and those included the fact

00:02:26.073 --> 00:02:28.598
that the building was made out
of stone,

00:02:28.598 --> 00:02:32.639
and also the fact that one of
the traditional Greek orders,

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:37.530
in this case the Ionic order,
was used for the structure.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.394
So this bringing together of
Greek and Etruscan elements in

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:45.282
this thoroughly Roman building,
but a building that again we

00:02:45.282 --> 00:02:47.660
would call a traditional Roman
building.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.318
And what do I mean by
traditional?

00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:53.035
All the traditional Roman
buildings share in common the

00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:54.479
following features.
 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.050
They have columns and they have
walls,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.967
and those columns and walls
serve a structural purpose and

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:05.680
that is to hold up the flat or
the sloping ceiling,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.145
the sloping roof,
and that is in fact exactly

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:10.718
what you see here.
 

00:03:10.718 --> 00:03:14.508
But at this very same time,
in the second century B.C.

00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:18.564
and into the first century
B.C., we begin to see a new kind

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:22.900
of experimentation that is going
on concurrently with this,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.778
an experimentation that grows
up in some of the same towns

00:03:26.778 --> 00:03:29.908
that we see traditional
buildings like this.

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:33.319
And what made this
experimentation different than

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.940
anything that had come before is
the fact that the Romans use,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.099
for these buildings,
a completely new material,

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.470
and that material is concrete.
 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.966
We talked about the fact that
already in the Temple of

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:51.660
Portunus concrete was used,
but concrete was used only in

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.650
the podium.
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:53.720
You can't see it.
 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.210
It is inside the podium and
serves to strengthen--

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.915
concrete has a great deal of
strength and can sustain great

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:03.465
weights--
and so it was placed in the

00:04:03.465 --> 00:04:07.771
podium for utilitarian purposes
so that it could help to support

00:04:07.771 --> 00:04:10.370
the temple that was located on
top.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.364
But again, none of its
expressive possibilities were

00:04:13.364 --> 00:04:17.062
explored by the designer of the
Temple of Portunus or any of the

00:04:17.062 --> 00:04:19.470
other temples we looked at last
time.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.009
But what begins to happen also,
in the course of the second and

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.497
first centuries B.C.,
is architects beginning to

00:04:26.497 --> 00:04:31.550
realize that this new concrete
technology has an opportunity to

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.214
transform Roman architecture,
and they begin to experiment

00:04:36.214 --> 00:04:38.050
with that transformation.
 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.319
In order to understand the
concrete buildings that we're

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.639
going to be looking at this
morning,

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.045
which are absolutely
fascinating--and I hope you'll

00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:49.500
be as enthralled by them as I
am,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.745
and they again stand at the
very beginning of this

00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:56.060
development of innovative
architecture in Rome--

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.399
it's important to know a bit
about concrete,

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:03.711
Roman concrete that is,
and I want to make a few points

00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:04.588
about it.
 

00:05:04.588 --> 00:05:07.884
Roman concrete -- the Latin
term for it is opus

00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:10.709
caementicum,
as I've indicated here.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:15.278
Roman concrete is different
from what we think of today as

00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:16.160
concrete.
 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.990
It's a composite of various
natural elements that becomes a

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.572
liquid mass when mixed with
water and eventually hardens

00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:28.682
into a very,
very strong substance,

00:05:28.682 --> 00:05:33.300
much stronger than any of its
ingredients are on their own.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.629
Roman concrete was a mixture of
stone rubble and liquid mortar,

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.351
and composed of lime,
sand and something called

00:05:42.351 --> 00:05:45.863
pozzolana --
pozzolana being a

00:05:45.863 --> 00:05:49.579
volcanic substance,
which was very plentiful in

00:05:49.579 --> 00:05:53.290
Italy, especially around the
area of Pompeii,

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.279
Herculaneum,
the area of Campania.

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.699
Concrete was used in Rome from
the early second century B.C.

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.720
on, but it was not until the
end of the second century,

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.860
and the beginning of the first
century,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.216
that the expressive
possibilities of concrete began

00:06:10.216 --> 00:06:12.220
to be fully realized.
 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.149
Concrete--I think this is also
important to mention,

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:20.430
when you think about concrete
construction in relationship to

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.185
stone construction,
that we've already discussed --

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:27.709
concrete is not cut or quarried
the way stone is.

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:30.319
Concrete is caste in molds.
 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:35.432
Concrete can be caste in any
shape, at least any shape that a

00:06:35.432 --> 00:06:38.160
carpenter can build with wood.
 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.630
And like modern builders,
the Romans erected wooden

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.101
frames for their walls and
ceilings and they poured

00:06:45.101 --> 00:06:47.740
concrete into those wooden
frames.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.632
What's most important for us,
in the context of this lecture

00:06:51.632 --> 00:06:56.259
and in this course in general,
is that the introduction of

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:01.071
Roman concrete into Roman
architecture freed the Roman

00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:06.608
architect from the confines of a
rectilinear architecture that

00:07:06.608 --> 00:07:10.329
they had inherited from the
Greeks,

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:14.495
the kind of rectilinear
architecture that made up a

00:07:14.495 --> 00:07:17.579
temple like the Temple of
Portunus.

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:22.288
This is a very momentous change
and one that will have a lasting

00:07:22.288 --> 00:07:25.278
impact on the buildings of the
Romans.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:28.810
Let me try to give you a sense
of what I mean by this.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.798
One could argue that the
greatest concrete structure

00:07:32.798 --> 00:07:35.850
built by the Romans was the
Pantheon.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.321
And I remind you of the
Pantheon on the right,

00:07:38.321 --> 00:07:41.233
in fact the dome of the
Pantheon, which would not have

00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:43.870
been possible without concrete
construction.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:49.533
But it's interesting to compare
the Pantheon to an attempt that

00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:54.922
Etruscan architects made to
create something similar but out

00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:56.110
of stone.
 

00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.192
I show you on the left-hand
side of the screen an Etruscan

00:08:00.192 --> 00:08:02.269
tomb that dates to 600 B.C.
 

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:05.778
So, very early in time,
600 B.C., an Etruscan tomb at a

00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:07.997
place called--
it's not on your Monument

00:08:07.997 --> 00:08:10.259
List--but at a place called
Quinto Fiorentino,

00:08:10.259 --> 00:08:15.360
Q-u-i-n-t-o,
new word, F-i-o-r-e-n-t-i-n-o.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.589
Quinto Fiorentino,
an Etruscan territory.

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:23.423
And what the architects have
done here is to try to create a

00:08:23.423 --> 00:08:27.519
round tomb, and they've used
stone, as you can see,

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:30.470
and they have laid those
stones.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.090
They've cut and quarried the
stones as usual.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.320
They've tried to cut them in
the shapes that they need in

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:37.820
order to make this work.
 

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.548
And they've piled them,
one on top of the other,

00:08:40.548 --> 00:08:43.658
row after row after row,
until they've gotten --

00:08:43.658 --> 00:08:45.668
it started out okay at the
bottom,

00:08:45.668 --> 00:08:48.936
but as they get further and
further on to the top and it

00:08:48.936 --> 00:08:52.538
gets rounder and rounder,
and converges at the apex,

00:08:52.538 --> 00:08:56.029
they start to have trouble,
as you can see.

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:59.145
And although it's a heroic,
a valiant attempt on their

00:08:59.145 --> 00:09:02.380
part, it isn't terribly
successful, at least to my mind,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.440
aesthetically.
 

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.312
And, in fact,
they were worried about it

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:07.639
falling down,
so they even had to place a

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:10.272
stone pier here,
to support the dome,

00:09:10.272 --> 00:09:12.980
to make sure that it didn't
drop.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.232
And actually that was pretty
successful, because here it is,

00:09:16.232 --> 00:09:18.383
still today,
looking pretty good in that

00:09:18.383 --> 00:09:18.990
regard.
 

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:23.969
But with the introduction of
concrete into architecture,

00:09:23.969 --> 00:09:27.681
under the Romans,
building a dome like the

00:09:27.681 --> 00:09:30.850
Pantheon was simplicity itself.
 

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:33.870
All you needed to be able to do
was to build one of these wooden

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.625
models,
wooden structures,

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:38.250
that you then poured concrete
into,

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.937
and voilÃ ,
you have the dome of the

00:09:40.937 --> 00:09:41.658
Pantheon.
 

00:09:41.658 --> 00:09:44.663
So simplicity itself,
transformational,

00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:47.668
vis-Ã -vis Roman
architecture.

00:09:47.668 --> 00:09:50.878
The only problem with concrete
-- there were two problems with

00:09:50.878 --> 00:09:54.350
concrete that the architects of
this period had to contend with.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:59.086
One of them was that concrete
has to be protected from

00:09:59.086 --> 00:10:04.448
moisture--that's number one--and
number two, that concrete is

00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:07.220
less attractive than stone.
 

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.220
The Roman architects of the
second and first centuries B.C.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.090
solved these two problems in
the same way.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:20.270
What they decided to do was
when the concrete was still wet,

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.730
they attached stone to it.
 

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.990
This could either be large
ashlar blocks,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.842
stone blocks,
or it could be small pieces of

00:10:28.842 --> 00:10:31.509
stone,
that uncertain work or opus

00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:34.360
incertum that we talked
about last time,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.308
pressed into the concrete when
it was wet,

00:10:37.308 --> 00:10:40.619
and when it all dried,
that stone both made the

00:10:40.619 --> 00:10:44.934
building look more attractive
and also protected the building

00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:46.230
from moisture.
 

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.080
We looked last time at that
opus incertum facing.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.480
I remind you of the Temple of
Vesta at Tivoli,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.246
which you see here,
and you will recall that the

00:10:56.246 --> 00:10:58.720
Temple of Vesta at Tivoli had
concrete,

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.812
both in its podium,
for utilitarian purposes and to

00:11:01.812 --> 00:11:04.408
support the great weight of the
temple,

00:11:04.408 --> 00:11:09.960
but also that the architects
explored making the cella wall,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.048
the curved cella wall,
also out of concrete.

00:11:13.048 --> 00:11:16.870
And then when that concrete was
wet they put in these small cut,

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.740
irregularly shaped stones,
called uncertain work or

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.350
opus incertum,
to protect that.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.155
So we saw that already in the
Temple of Vesta,

00:11:26.155 --> 00:11:28.587
even though it was a
traditional temple,

00:11:28.587 --> 00:11:31.019
based on Greek and Etruscan
models.

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:33.570
And we'll see it again today,
in several buildings,

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.210
and I'll show you just one
example,

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.678
the last structure that we'll
talk about today,

00:11:38.678 --> 00:11:42.970
the Sanctuary of Fortuna
Primigenia at Palestrina,

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.460
an extraordinary structure
built on a hillside,

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:50.080
that also used opus
incertum as the facing.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.722
And you can see it used here
for the wall and also for the

00:11:54.722 --> 00:11:56.759
coffered ceiling above.
 

00:11:56.759 --> 00:12:00.148
And so a stone facing,
opus incertum,

00:12:00.148 --> 00:12:04.720
that was particularly favored
in the second century B.C.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.808
and into the first century B.C.
 

00:12:07.808 --> 00:12:11.330
Over time the choice of facing
changed.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.567
Although ashlar blocks,
tufa, travertine,

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:19.426
and opus incertum were
popular in the second and first

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:23.070
centuries, as time goes on
things change.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:26.631
We'll see, under the Roman
emperor Nerva there was a

00:12:26.631 --> 00:12:29.091
revolution,
another kind of revolution of

00:12:29.091 --> 00:12:30.822
sorts,
in Roman architecture,

00:12:30.822 --> 00:12:34.187
and we'll talk about the
reasons for that and so on later

00:12:34.187 --> 00:12:35.330
in the semester.
 

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.897
But with that revolution came
an interest in a new facing

00:12:38.897 --> 00:12:42.655
material, namely brick -- brick
that was originally stuccoed

00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:43.230
over.
 

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.394
And, in fact,
the opus incertum work

00:12:45.394 --> 00:12:48.229
and the tufa stone that we've
talked about already today

00:12:48.229 --> 00:12:50.240
tended to be stuccoed over as
well.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:54.921
But by the second century we
begin to see an appreciation for

00:12:54.921 --> 00:12:58.919
brick in its own right,
the attractiveness of brick,

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:03.001
and the Romans begin to use
exposed brick as the facing for

00:13:03.001 --> 00:13:04.340
their buildings.
 

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.620
And I show you one example.
 

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.826
It's a detail of a warehouse in
the Roman port city of Ostia,

00:13:08.826 --> 00:13:12.032
that we'll look at later in the
term, with this exposed brick

00:13:12.032 --> 00:13:13.447
facing;
very attractive,

00:13:13.447 --> 00:13:15.830
different colorations and so on
and so forth.

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.937
Just to alert you to the fact
that again the kind of facing

00:13:19.937 --> 00:13:24.330
that we're talking about today
will not be the only facing that

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.879
is used by the Romans over time.
 

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:30.230
I want to show you today a
series of these concrete

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.841
constructions,
concrete experiments we might

00:13:32.841 --> 00:13:35.360
call them,
that begin to turn up,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.065
not only in Rome itself,
but also in some of the cities

00:13:40.065 --> 00:13:43.421
close to Rome,
that we saw Rome began to

00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:48.100
colonize in the Republic and
into the age of Augustus --

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.660
cities that either are the same
or very close to the ones that

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.482
we looked at last time,
and I'll show you a map

00:13:54.482 --> 00:13:55.220
momentarily.
 

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.899
I just want to begin with one
in Rome itself.

00:13:57.899 --> 00:14:02.350
This is the so-called Porticus
Aemilia in Rome.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.678
The Porticus Aemilia was a
warehouse, a very large

00:14:05.678 --> 00:14:08.668
warehouse on the banks of the
Tiber River.

00:14:08.668 --> 00:14:15.130
The Porticus Aemilia was built,
as you can see from the dates

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.008
on your Monument List,
very early on,

00:14:19.008 --> 00:14:23.639
193 B.C., and then restored in
174 B.C.

00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:28.240
Only a small fragment of the
Porticus Aemilia survives today,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.899
but we have a lot of evidence,
a lot of clues,

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:35.347
that we can piece together
through scholarly detective

00:14:35.347 --> 00:14:38.238
work,
to determine what this building

00:14:38.238 --> 00:14:41.744
looked like in antiquity,
and we can get a quite accurate

00:14:41.744 --> 00:14:42.100
sense.
 

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:45.957
We have, for example,
the words of the great Roman

00:14:45.957 --> 00:14:49.345
historian Livy,
Livy, who was writing in the

00:14:49.345 --> 00:14:50.918
age of Augustus.
 

00:14:50.918 --> 00:14:55.759
He tells us that the Porticus
Aemilia--

00:14:55.759 --> 00:14:57.351
he describes it,
he mentions the Porticus

00:14:57.351 --> 00:14:59.990
Aemilia--
and he tells us it was located

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.778
on the east bank of the Tiber
River,

00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:09.009
and that it was southwest of
one of Rome's Seven Hills,

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:10.710
the Aventine Hill.
 

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.817
Southwest of the Aventine Hill,
which is enormously helpful

00:15:13.817 --> 00:15:16.980
because it gives archaeologists
and so on a clue as to where

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.250
they might look for remains of
this particular structure.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:21.769
So we have that.
 

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:25.042
We also have a fragment of the
building, we believe,

00:15:25.042 --> 00:15:27.865
because it's located just in
the right place,

00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:29.789
and I show it to you here.
 

00:15:29.789 --> 00:15:30.820
It's not much.
 

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:35.029
It's essentially a hunk of
concrete that includes an arched

00:15:35.029 --> 00:15:38.938
doorway and some arched windows,
but it's very important in

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:41.783
terms of allowing us to
reconstruct what this structure

00:15:41.783 --> 00:15:43.259
looked like in antiquity.
 

00:15:43.259 --> 00:15:47.693
But most significant of all,
we have a fragment from what is

00:15:47.693 --> 00:15:50.250
known as the Marble Map of Rome.
 

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.590
The Marble Map of Rome,
called the Forma Urbis--

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.730
and I've put that word on the
Monument List,

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.580
that title on the Monument List
for you,

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.217
the Forma Urbis--the
Forma Urbis was a great

00:16:01.217 --> 00:16:05.558
marble map that was made of Rome
in the early third century A.D.,

00:16:05.558 --> 00:16:08.330
under the emperorship of
Septimius Severus,

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.474
and put up on a wall in Rome,
and we'll talk about its

00:16:11.474 --> 00:16:13.610
location later on in the
semester.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.961
But it purported to represent
all the buildings that were

00:16:18.961 --> 00:16:23.740
standing in Rome in the early
third century A.D.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.657
It is fragmentary today,
but there are a fair number of

00:16:26.657 --> 00:16:28.974
fragments,
and fortunately a couple of

00:16:28.974 --> 00:16:31.950
those fragments,
or several of those fragments,

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:35.178
are fragments that represent
the Porticus Aemilia.

00:16:35.178 --> 00:16:38.409
So we can tell from that,
from Livy's description,

00:16:38.409 --> 00:16:42.235
from this fragmentary remain,
we can piece together what it

00:16:42.235 --> 00:16:43.288
looked like.
 

00:16:43.288 --> 00:16:46.970
And you can see it here,
a very, very long rectangular

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.720
structure that went all along
the bank of the river.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.100
Storage, you need a lot of
storage,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:57.918
especially as the Romans began
to conquer the world,

00:16:57.918 --> 00:17:00.971
they were trading more
extensively with other parts of

00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:04.202
the world,
and consequently they needed

00:17:04.202 --> 00:17:09.614
places along the Tiber River to
store the goods that were both

00:17:09.614 --> 00:17:12.009
going out and coming in.
 

00:17:12.009 --> 00:17:14.854
So they build this gigantic
warehouse along the banks of the

00:17:14.854 --> 00:17:15.240
Tiber.
 

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.192
Now there's a fair amount of
disagreement about some of the

00:17:19.192 --> 00:17:22.670
smaller details of this
warehouse and what it looked

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.170
like in antiquity.
 

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.853
So we have to do the best that
we can to bring that evidence

00:17:27.853 --> 00:17:30.598
together to determine what it
looked like.

00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:32.833
But as I said,
in some details you'll see

00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:33.950
there's variation.
 

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.538
So several of the things I'm
going to show you vary slightly,

00:17:37.538 --> 00:17:40.970
but the only one that you'll be
ultimately responsible for is

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.200
the one that's on your Monument
List.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.536
But I just want you to be aware
of the fact that there are

00:17:46.536 --> 00:17:49.990
different interpretations of
exactly what it looked like.

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:52.679
What we are sure of,
and what's most important for

00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:56.135
us today, is that it was made of
concrete and that it had barrel

00:17:56.135 --> 00:17:56.740
vaults.
 

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:58.048
What was a barrel vault?
 

00:17:58.048 --> 00:18:04.348
A barrel vault was a vault that
was again made out of concrete,

00:18:04.348 --> 00:18:07.513
placed on a wall,
and then the vault was shaped

00:18:07.513 --> 00:18:10.621
like the side of a barrel,
as you can see here,

00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:13.009
which is why it's called a
barrel vault --

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.944
shaped like the side of a
barrel, resting on walls down

00:18:15.944 --> 00:18:16.380
below.
 

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.569
A fairly simple shape that
could not have been made,

00:18:19.569 --> 00:18:22.509
or would be very difficult to
make out of stone,

00:18:22.509 --> 00:18:25.700
but was easily able to be made
out of concrete.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.548
And we see a series of those
barrel vaults,

00:18:28.548 --> 00:18:31.599
placed one next to another,
for the warehouse,

00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:34.108
for the Porticus Aemilia in
Rome.

00:18:34.108 --> 00:18:36.650
It was placed--and actually I
neglected to mention,

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.531
Livy also tells us that the
Porticus Aemilia had four tiers

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:43.194
--
it was tiered in four levels --

00:18:43.194 --> 00:18:45.900
and we see those four tiers
here,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:52.737
rising up ever so slightly
along the slope of the Tiber

00:18:52.737 --> 00:18:53.750
River.
 

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.201
This is a cross-section of what
the inside of the Basilica

00:18:57.201 --> 00:18:59.200
Aemilia might have looked like.
 

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.019
You see those great barrel
vaults here.

00:19:02.019 --> 00:19:05.903
You see that the architect has
been adventurous in the sense

00:19:05.903 --> 00:19:09.788
that he has not placed the
barrel vaults on solid walls,

00:19:09.788 --> 00:19:13.608
as we saw in that diagram,
but has opened those walls up,

00:19:13.608 --> 00:19:17.834
created piers and arches above
those piers to create these

00:19:17.834 --> 00:19:21.497
arcades,
which is quite ingenious and

00:19:21.497 --> 00:19:25.167
very smart,
because what it does is enable

00:19:25.167 --> 00:19:28.827
there to be both axial movement,
through the building,

00:19:28.827 --> 00:19:30.108
but also lateral movement.
 

00:19:30.108 --> 00:19:33.220
You can walk not only along
each barrel vault,

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.180
but you can walk in between the
piers which,

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.890
as I said, creates a sense of
much more openness,

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.190
and lateral as well as axial
movement.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.380
The other thing that you see
here are the back walls,

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:50.221
where we can see just what we
saw in that fragment of the

00:19:50.221 --> 00:19:52.690
building,
the arched doorways,

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:57.338
as well as the arched windows
in the back walls,

00:19:57.338 --> 00:19:59.798
which of course allow light
into the structure.

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:02.140
Lots of activity needed to
happen here,

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.255
as things were moved in and
out, and those who worked here

00:20:05.255 --> 00:20:08.480
needed to be able to see
everything that they were doing.

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.230
The view that you have on your
Monument List is this one.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:16.048
It's a restored view of what
the Porticus Aemilia might've

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:19.400
looked like in antiquity,
and it's very helpful.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:22.477
It's a cutaway view,
which gives you most of the

00:20:22.477 --> 00:20:24.769
major features,
all in one place.

00:20:24.769 --> 00:20:26.838
You can see that it is indeed
tiered.

00:20:26.838 --> 00:20:29.753
There are four tiers for this
structure, that they move up

00:20:29.753 --> 00:20:32.259
slightly as they move up the
slope of the hill.

00:20:32.259 --> 00:20:34.230
You can see the use of the
barrel vaults.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.088
You can see the piers down
below.

00:20:36.088 --> 00:20:39.788
You can see the flat roof that
these seemed to have.

00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:43.170
But as they rose up slightly
along the slope of the hill,

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:48.210
you can see that the designer
has placed small,

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.747
curved, slit windows on each
tier to allow again additional

00:20:52.747 --> 00:20:54.858
light into the structure.
 

00:20:54.858 --> 00:20:57.118
And you can also see,
from this diagram,

00:20:57.118 --> 00:21:00.848
that it was made of concrete
and faced with opus

00:21:00.848 --> 00:21:03.432
incertum work --
these small,

00:21:03.432 --> 00:21:08.380
irregular stones that we saw in
the Temple of Vesta also used as

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.578
the facing material here.
 

00:21:10.578 --> 00:21:14.344
Here's one more restored view,
which shows you roughly the

00:21:14.344 --> 00:21:17.162
same: the four tiers,
the barrel vaults,

00:21:17.162 --> 00:21:19.558
the windows on the various
tiers,

00:21:19.558 --> 00:21:23.838
and then most importantly these
doorways and windows in the

00:21:23.838 --> 00:21:27.519
back,
as well as the general space

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:33.588
that was available inside this
extraordinary building.

00:21:33.588 --> 00:21:38.029
I mentioned that while we'll
look at a couple of buildings,

00:21:38.029 --> 00:21:40.354
several buildings in Rome,
I also want to go out to some

00:21:40.354 --> 00:21:42.509
of the colonies that were
founded by the Romans,

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:45.733
in the vicinity of Rome,
in the second and first

00:21:45.733 --> 00:21:48.648
centuries B.C.,
where they began to build,

00:21:48.648 --> 00:21:49.359
as we saw.
 

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:50.838
They began to plan towns.
 

00:21:50.838 --> 00:21:53.068
They began to put walls around
those towns.

00:21:53.068 --> 00:21:57.606
They began to put temples in
those towns and they also began

00:21:57.606 --> 00:22:01.298
to put other structures,
including warehouses and

00:22:01.298 --> 00:22:03.528
sanctuaries and the like.
 

00:22:03.528 --> 00:22:05.308
The ones that we're going to
look at today--

00:22:05.308 --> 00:22:09.721
here again, Rome is at the
star--and we're going to look at

00:22:09.721 --> 00:22:13.977
buildings in Terracina,
over here, in Tivoli,

00:22:13.977 --> 00:22:16.578
and also in Palestrina.
 

00:22:16.578 --> 00:22:20.435
And you can see the proximity
of those to others we talked

00:22:20.435 --> 00:22:23.277
about last time,
Norba and Cosa and Falerii

00:22:23.277 --> 00:22:25.509
Novi, and so on and so forth.
 

00:22:25.509 --> 00:22:28.009
It's not surprising,
again, to see the Romans

00:22:28.009 --> 00:22:31.306
turning to their environs as
they make these earliest towns

00:22:31.306 --> 00:22:33.750
and as they start to fill these
towns,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:39.740
to make them into the kind of
mini-Romes that they so desired.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:41.558
So we're going to look at a
series of these,

00:22:41.558 --> 00:22:45.788
of different dates and of
considerable interest,

00:22:45.788 --> 00:22:49.390
in terms of what they herald
for the future of Roman

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:50.450
architecture.
 

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.769
The first that we're going to
look at is a market hall,

00:22:53.769 --> 00:22:57.190
a market hall at a place called
Ferentino,

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:00.769
and it dates to--I may have
neglected to show you Ferentino

00:23:00.769 --> 00:23:04.038
on that map but it's in with all
the others there,

00:23:04.038 --> 00:23:08.578
Ferentino--around 100 B.C.,
it dates to.

00:23:08.578 --> 00:23:12.082
And you can see that it's
essentially one giant barrel

00:23:12.082 --> 00:23:15.914
vault, one giant barrel vault,
which was used as the market

00:23:15.914 --> 00:23:16.509
hall.
 

00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:20.618
You can see also that that
giant barrel vault,

00:23:20.618 --> 00:23:23.588
which is made of concrete,
has opening off it,

00:23:23.588 --> 00:23:28.220
on the sides,
a series of arched areas,

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.900
also barrel vaulted on the
inside.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.640
These were used as the market
stalls inside this marketplace.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.794
You can also see I believe very
well that the facing that is

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:43.596
used for this concrete is
opus incertum work for

00:23:43.596 --> 00:23:45.920
the walls and for the vaults.
 

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.920
And then what they've done to
emphasize the location and the

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.781
shape of the arches,
they have used stone around

00:23:53.781 --> 00:23:57.119
those --
also to give further solidity

00:23:57.119 --> 00:24:01.640
to this part of the building
they have used stone.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.068
And you can see it's a
combination of nicely cut ashlar

00:24:06.068 --> 00:24:08.159
blocks,
down here, but also the

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:11.579
voussoir blocks that we
saw in the Falerii Novi gate,

00:24:11.579 --> 00:24:13.950
used over the arches.
 

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:19.578
So this combination of both
stone, of opus quadratum

00:24:19.578 --> 00:24:23.365
stone, and also of opus
incertum,

00:24:23.365 --> 00:24:28.509
used as the facing for this
particular structure.

00:24:28.509 --> 00:24:32.273
What's significant about this
building is that it looks

00:24:32.273 --> 00:24:36.455
forward to things that we're
going to see later on develop in

00:24:36.455 --> 00:24:38.058
Roman architecture.
 

00:24:38.058 --> 00:24:42.047
Primarily I showed you in the
introductory lecture a glimpse

00:24:42.047 --> 00:24:44.480
of the Markets of Trajan in
Rome,

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.923
and I remind you here of the
great market hall of the Markets

00:24:47.923 --> 00:24:49.787
of Trajan,
which is even more

00:24:49.787 --> 00:24:52.210
sophisticated in its use of
concrete,

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.098
because it has ribbed vaults,
as you can see.

00:24:54.098 --> 00:24:57.529
But this experimentation that
we're going to see in the early

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:58.730
second century A.D.
 

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:02.196
in Rome would not have been
possible without the

00:25:02.196 --> 00:25:06.698
experimentation in concrete that
took place in this very early

00:25:06.698 --> 00:25:11.200
stage in the second century and
in the first century B.C.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.883
Even much more interesting in
fact is the building that I'd

00:25:15.883 --> 00:25:19.517
like to turn to now,
and this is the so-called

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:23.068
Sanctuary of Jupiter Anxur at
Terracina.

00:25:23.068 --> 00:25:26.537
It dates, we believe,
to 100 to 70 B.C.,

00:25:26.537 --> 00:25:32.140
and it is, like so many Roman
buildings, spectacularly sited.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.140
I had mentioned this on several
occasions.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.628
We looked at the Mediaeval hill
town of Cori,

00:25:36.628 --> 00:25:38.893
for example,
where the Temple of Hercules

00:25:38.893 --> 00:25:41.440
was located at the very apex of
the hill.

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.157
The Romans had an incredible
knack for choosing extraordinary

00:25:45.157 --> 00:25:48.009
locations on which to site their
buildings,

00:25:48.009 --> 00:25:50.288
locations that made those
buildings --

00:25:50.288 --> 00:25:53.029
that accentuated those
buildings from a distance --

00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:57.698
but also gave those who went to
the buildings amazing views out

00:25:57.698 --> 00:25:59.430
from those buildings.
 

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.876
This is one of those examples,
the Sanctuary of Jupiter Anxur

00:26:03.876 --> 00:26:04.990
at Terracina.
 

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:08.440
The best view of this sanctuary
is from the sea.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.596
If you happen to be fortunate
enough to be floating on a boat

00:26:11.596 --> 00:26:14.385
somewhere near Terracina--
and it's a beautiful place to

00:26:14.385 --> 00:26:16.001
float--
you will see,

00:26:16.001 --> 00:26:19.759
from a distance,
the great podium of the

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:22.650
Sanctuary of Jupiter Anxur.
 

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.799
But you can also see it from
the town, which is where we're

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:26.670
situated here.
 

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.820
We're standing in the town,
a couple of decent pizzerias

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.570
right in front of us,
and we're looking up at the

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.150
hill on which the sanctuary
finds itself.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.442
Now as you look up to that
hill, all you can actually see

00:26:38.442 --> 00:26:42.086
is all that's actually up there
now, which is the podium of the

00:26:42.086 --> 00:26:42.910
sanctuary.
 

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.218
The temple is no longer there,
although there's some evidence

00:26:46.218 --> 00:26:48.823
up there,
some remains that gives us a

00:26:48.823 --> 00:26:52.920
decent sense of what that temple
looked like in antiquity.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.825
But the podium is extremely
well preserved,

00:26:55.825 --> 00:26:59.284
and you see it again
magnificently sited at the top

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:00.460
of that hill.
 

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.606
This is a restored view of what
the podium would've looked

00:27:05.606 --> 00:27:09.070
like--
what the podium does look like,

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.704
as we see it here--
and as it would have supported

00:27:12.704 --> 00:27:16.726
the temple on top,
and also a back columnar

00:27:16.726 --> 00:27:22.009
element over here,
that was roofed, as you can see.

00:27:22.009 --> 00:27:26.282
If we look at this restored
view, we see several things that

00:27:26.282 --> 00:27:27.660
are worth noting.
 

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.211
One, that the temple itself is
very much a traditional building

00:27:32.211 --> 00:27:36.248
and one that is very much in the
tradition indeed of the

00:27:36.248 --> 00:27:38.182
buildings,
the temples,

00:27:38.182 --> 00:27:42.137
that we've already discussed:
this combination of Etruscan

00:27:42.137 --> 00:27:46.509
plan and of Greek elevation that
we saw in so many of these.

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:48.603
You can see,
for example--and again there's

00:27:48.603 --> 00:27:51.593
enough evidence for us to be
pretty sure that this is what it

00:27:51.593 --> 00:27:53.298
looked like --
high podium,

00:27:53.298 --> 00:27:56.670
single staircase,
emphasis on the faÃ§ade,

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.140
deep porch, freestanding
columns in that porch,

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.338
but columns that seem to have
encircled the monument.

00:28:03.338 --> 00:28:08.161
So this combination of--and
stone construction we think--so

00:28:08.161 --> 00:28:12.982
a combination once again of
Etruscan and Greek elements for

00:28:12.982 --> 00:28:14.230
the temple.
 

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.450
You'll probably notice that the
temple is slightly skewed,

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.623
the angle of the temple of
skewed, it's not straight on

00:28:20.623 --> 00:28:22.875
with the podium,
which is very unusual for the

00:28:22.875 --> 00:28:23.190
Romans.
 

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:27.400
We'll see that the Romans were
very interested in everything

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.896
being exactly as it should be:
axial, symmetrical,

00:28:30.896 --> 00:28:32.608
both sides matching.
 

00:28:32.608 --> 00:28:35.299
It's very unusual for them to
skew something like this.

00:28:35.299 --> 00:28:36.548
Why did they do it?
 

00:28:36.548 --> 00:28:40.789
It probably had something to do
either with something that was

00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:43.396
already on the site,
some other building,

00:28:43.396 --> 00:28:46.673
that forced them to do this,
or having something to do with

00:28:46.673 --> 00:28:50.200
the particular god who was
honored here and the location --

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.077
the way they wanted that to be
in relationship to various

00:28:54.077 --> 00:28:58.460
elements of the rites--
or east-west, or whatever.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:03.060
There was something that caused
them to put this in the position

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.230
that they did.
 

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.000
And you can also see that it
isn't--

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.200
it has this back colonnade
behind it,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.881
covered colonnade behind it,
but it isn't attached to it in

00:29:11.881 --> 00:29:13.960
any way,
which is also unusual,

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.960
as we'll see.
 

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.358
The podium you see down here,
made up of a series of arcades.

00:29:19.358 --> 00:29:22.808
You can see once again both
axial and lateral access,

00:29:22.808 --> 00:29:26.170
because just as in the Porticus
Aemilia,

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:30.558
they have created smaller
arcades in the side piers,

00:29:30.558 --> 00:29:34.519
to allow this kind of axiality
in the structure,

00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:38.130
or movement through the
structure in more than one way.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.403
The podium is extremely well
preserved, as you can see,

00:29:42.403 --> 00:29:44.538
and extremely impressive.
 

00:29:44.538 --> 00:29:46.858
It's an extraordinary place to
go.

00:29:46.858 --> 00:29:49.098
It's a lot of fun to go there
to see this.

00:29:49.098 --> 00:29:50.950
It's off the beaten track,
to a certain extent,

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.950
but it is on the road between
Rome and Naples,

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.509
so that if one is going from
Rome down to Pompeii,

00:29:56.509 --> 00:30:00.220
this is the sort of thing one
can stop and take a look at,

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.929
and there're some other
interesting things along the way

00:30:01.929 --> 00:30:02.240
as well.
 

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:05.079
We see here the great podium,
as it looks today.

00:30:05.079 --> 00:30:06.568
It's made out of concrete.
 

00:30:06.568 --> 00:30:11.440
You can see both the large
arcades and then these lateral

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.309
ones that I mentioned before,
on the interior face of the

00:30:16.309 --> 00:30:17.180
piers.
 

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:22.434
You can also see that they have
used opus incertum facing

00:30:22.434 --> 00:30:23.019
here.
 

00:30:23.019 --> 00:30:26.199
These are regular stones,
all bunched together to create

00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:29.146
an attractive appearance,
although this was probably

00:30:29.146 --> 00:30:30.650
stuccoed in antiquity.
 

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:35.499
And then they have used stone
blocks to emphasize the juncture

00:30:35.499 --> 00:30:39.316
of each of these walls,
but also to help give the

00:30:39.316 --> 00:30:41.940
building increased stability.
 

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.048
So this combination of
stone--well it's all stone--

00:30:45.048 --> 00:30:48.703
but this combination of blocks
of stone and the smaller opus

00:30:48.703 --> 00:30:51.710
incertum stones for the
facing of the podium.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.720
And here's a wonderful view,
I think,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.241
that shows you a panorama
through a number of these

00:30:58.241 --> 00:31:01.814
lateral arches,
and gives you some sense of how

00:31:01.814 --> 00:31:05.263
carefully orchestrated this was
by the architect who was

00:31:05.263 --> 00:31:06.769
responsible for this.
 

00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:10.093
It's never too early for me to
emphasize that the Romans were

00:31:10.093 --> 00:31:13.028
very concerned with creating
vistas and panoramas,

00:31:13.028 --> 00:31:15.680
from one part of a building to
another,

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.778
from one part of a complex to
another,

00:31:17.778 --> 00:31:22.118
and they never lost an
opportunity to do that.

00:31:22.118 --> 00:31:25.420
So that as you stand and look
through a series of these

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:28.041
lateral arches,
you can see how carefully

00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:31.567
arranged that was,
to pay attention not only to

00:31:31.567 --> 00:31:37.036
the way in which the arches--
you can see them in a series,

00:31:37.036 --> 00:31:40.749
as you can see here,
looking almost as if they're

00:31:40.749 --> 00:31:43.141
diminishing in size,
although they aren't

00:31:43.141 --> 00:31:46.482
really--but also this idea of
creating exciting visual

00:31:46.482 --> 00:31:47.430
experiences.
 

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.558
As you walk through something,
not just to walk through it,

00:31:50.558 --> 00:31:54.048
but to see something that
really amazes you and that

00:31:54.048 --> 00:31:57.071
fascinates you,
and that creation of vista and

00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:59.740
panorama --
both panorama out onto the

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.670
countryside,
from the hilltop,

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.308
but also a panorama or vista
through a building --

00:32:04.308 --> 00:32:06.578
is something quintessentially
Roman,

00:32:06.578 --> 00:32:10.933
and we'll see it turning up
again and again and again as a

00:32:10.933 --> 00:32:13.990
major objective of Roman
architecture.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:17.710
A view once again of the
restored view of the sanctuary.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:23.137
The sanctuary had below it an
underground passageway called a

00:32:23.137 --> 00:32:26.419
cryptoporticus--
and I put that word on the

00:32:26.419 --> 00:32:29.093
Monument List for you--
a cryptoporticus that

00:32:29.093 --> 00:32:31.259
was used essentially for
storage,

00:32:31.259 --> 00:32:34.940
for storage purposes for this
sanctuary.

00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:37.166
And, believe it or not,
we actually have the

00:32:37.166 --> 00:32:40.067
cryptoporticus still
preserved, and we can look at

00:32:40.067 --> 00:32:40.430
it.
 

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:43.654
And it's interesting because
here too we see the architects

00:32:43.654 --> 00:32:47.095
using concrete construction,
creating a barrel vaulted

00:32:47.095 --> 00:32:49.813
corridor,
in this case with windows on

00:32:49.813 --> 00:32:53.740
the end and then a few doorways
and some slit windows,

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.868
all of them arched,
as you can see here,

00:32:55.868 --> 00:32:58.160
to allow light into the
structure.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.352
It was used,
as I said, for storage

00:33:00.352 --> 00:33:03.189
purposes, storage having to do
with the cult,

00:33:03.189 --> 00:33:04.930
and so on and so forth.
 

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:07.395
It's very important--and we're
going to look at a couple of

00:33:07.395 --> 00:33:10.210
other sanctuaries as well--
to keep in mind that these

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:13.230
sanctuaries were meant--
they were different than an

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:16.230
individual temple in a forum
inside an urban complex.

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.259
They were meant to draw
pilgrims from far and wide,

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:22.888
which is one of the reasons
that they were placed in such

00:33:22.888 --> 00:33:24.885
prominent positions,
on tops of mountains,

00:33:24.885 --> 00:33:29.028
so that you wouldn't--
if you were going by in your

00:33:29.028 --> 00:33:32.202
cart, or whatever,
and saw this,

00:33:32.202 --> 00:33:34.788
from a distance,
or coming by sea,

00:33:34.788 --> 00:33:36.940
in a boat, seeing it from a
distance,

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.811
you would be drawn--it would be
like a Mecca that you would be

00:33:39.811 --> 00:33:40.328
drawn to.
 

00:33:40.328 --> 00:33:44.390
So these sanctuaries were meant
to attract large numbers of

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:45.578
people to them.
 

00:33:45.578 --> 00:33:49.474
So they needed to provide not
just the temple itself but other

00:33:49.474 --> 00:33:51.710
things, and they were like
malls.

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.750
They often included shopping
areas,

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.026
souvenir shops,
shopping stores for local

00:33:57.026 --> 00:34:00.140
specialties and that kind of
thing,

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:06.630
in order to encourage people to
visit.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:10.264
I'd like to turn to another,
also very interesting

00:34:10.264 --> 00:34:13.900
sanctuary, that was put up at
around this time.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.994
This is the Sanctuary of
Hercules at Tivoli,

00:34:17.994 --> 00:34:22.757
and it was erected,
we believe, sometime between 75

00:34:22.757 --> 00:34:25.329
and 50 B.C., in Tivoli.
 

00:34:25.329 --> 00:34:27.369
It is an incredible place.
 

00:34:27.369 --> 00:34:32.088
It is not so different from the
Sanctuary of Jupiter Anxur in

00:34:32.088 --> 00:34:36.019
its general intentions:
this whole idea of creating

00:34:36.019 --> 00:34:40.266
this Mecca for religious
activity and also just a place

00:34:40.266 --> 00:34:44.905
that people would enjoy coming
to and gathering together for

00:34:44.905 --> 00:34:47.030
social interaction.
 

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:51.489
We see a restored view of what
it looked like in antiquity.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:55.242
It is similar to and different
from the Jupiter Anxur

00:34:55.242 --> 00:34:56.110
Sanctuary.
 

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:00.626
Just like the Jupiter Anxur
Sanctuary, it rests on a very

00:35:00.626 --> 00:35:03.449
tall, on a tall and large
podium.

00:35:03.449 --> 00:35:05.969
As you can see,
the temple doesn't stand in

00:35:05.969 --> 00:35:08.969
isolation but is raised up on
this large podium.

00:35:08.969 --> 00:35:12.396
You can see that it has a
temple in the center,

00:35:12.396 --> 00:35:16.420
this one completely pushed up
against the back wall and

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.210
completely straight.
 

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:24.750
So axial: created in axial
relationship to the podium.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.978
The temple, we believe,
was also one of these

00:35:27.978 --> 00:35:31.869
traditional types of temples
with the tall podium,

00:35:31.869 --> 00:35:34.726
with a staircase on one side,
with columns going around at

00:35:34.726 --> 00:35:37.264
least three sides,
deep porch, freestanding

00:35:37.264 --> 00:35:40.943
columns in that porch,
raised up on its own podium,

00:35:40.943 --> 00:35:44.000
and then the larger podium down
below.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.239
One of the features that we see
here,

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:49.449
that we did not see in the
Jupiter Anxur Sanctuary,

00:35:49.449 --> 00:35:54.510
is the use of the circular
staircase here,

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.619
which adds drama to the design.
 

00:35:56.619 --> 00:36:01.260
It's also on axis with the
staircase of the temple itself,

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.329
but it also serves as a kind
of--it's shaped like a theater,

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:07.860
a theater cavea--we call
it a cavea,

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.153
the seating:
c-a-v-e-a, the cavea of

00:36:10.153 --> 00:36:10.809
a theater.
 

00:36:10.809 --> 00:36:13.010
It's shaped just like that,
as you can see here,

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:16.597
and we believe its purpose was
not so much as a monumental

00:36:16.597 --> 00:36:19.179
entranceway or a monumental
staircase,

00:36:19.179 --> 00:36:21.500
although it served that
purpose, to a certain extent,

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.744
but also as a place where
people could gather and could

00:36:24.744 --> 00:36:27.150
sit and probably watch
performances --

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.996
religious performances perhaps,
or perhaps other kinds of

00:36:29.996 --> 00:36:32.661
performances --
in front of this,

00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:36.480
in front of the Temple of
Hercules.

00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.340
And there may have been some
kind of a stage building.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.641
There was a wall here,
so there may have been also

00:36:43.641 --> 00:36:48.644
some kind of stage building in
front of that semi-circular

00:36:48.644 --> 00:36:50.050
seated area.
 

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:53.768
This is another restored view,
showing you the same.

00:36:53.768 --> 00:36:57.219
You can perhaps see that
theatrical area better here,

00:36:57.219 --> 00:37:01.545
again serving as a dramatic
staircase but at the same time

00:37:01.545 --> 00:37:05.567
as a place where performances
could take place at this

00:37:05.567 --> 00:37:06.630
structure.
 

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.380
But all the other features are
apparent.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:11.971
And I want you to pay special
attention to the fact that we

00:37:11.971 --> 00:37:15.130
have the temple pushed up
against the back wall,

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.469
not one of the short back walls
but--

00:37:17.469 --> 00:37:20.242
well none of them are short
here--but against a long back

00:37:20.242 --> 00:37:21.556
wall,
as you can see,

00:37:21.556 --> 00:37:24.764
but pushed up against it,
dominating the space in front

00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:25.139
of it.
 

00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:27.721
We're going to see,
when we turn to Pompeii on

00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:30.440
Thursday,
that this same idea of pushing

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.840
a temple against a back wall is
characteristic of forum design,

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.619
the design of meeting and
marketplaces,

00:37:36.619 --> 00:37:43.369
as it is for sanctuary design.
 

00:37:43.369 --> 00:37:48.773
The Sanctuary of Hercules at
Tivoli is preserved in part--and

00:37:48.773 --> 00:37:52.556
I can show you one very
interesting detail,

00:37:52.556 --> 00:37:56.518
which is what you see now on
the screen.

00:37:56.518 --> 00:38:03.510
We are looking at part--let me
go back for a second just to

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.559
point this out.
 

00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:09.070
If you look along the sides and
the back,

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.463
you will see that there are
columns above and then columns

00:38:12.463 --> 00:38:14.786
with arcades:
arcades and columns in the

00:38:14.786 --> 00:38:17.996
first story,
and then columns on their own,

00:38:17.996 --> 00:38:19.460
in the upper story.
 

00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:23.713
So what I'm going to show you
now is a section of the lower

00:38:23.713 --> 00:38:27.159
story of the Sanctuary of
Hercules at Tivoli.

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:31.047
And we can see that what we
have here is a very important

00:38:31.047 --> 00:38:33.114
combination--
and it's the first time we've

00:38:33.114 --> 00:38:35.610
seen this today--
of arches with columns

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.806
interspersed,
columns placed,

00:38:37.806 --> 00:38:40.030
engaged or attached into the
wall,

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:44.449
in between these arcades,
as you can see here.

00:38:44.449 --> 00:38:46.739
The construction is concrete.
 

00:38:46.739 --> 00:38:50.400
The facing is a combination of
stone--

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.550
look at the blocks,
the ashlar blocks,

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.059
and the voussoirs above
the arches,

00:38:55.059 --> 00:38:59.219
and opus incertum work
for the walls,

00:38:59.219 --> 00:39:00.449
as you can see here.
 

00:39:00.449 --> 00:39:02.929
But the scheme of columns in
between arcades:

00:39:02.929 --> 00:39:04.170
extremely important.
 

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:08.675
This is setting in place the
kind of scheme that we're going

00:39:08.675 --> 00:39:13.027
to see used for buildings like
the Colosseum in Rome -- so

00:39:13.027 --> 00:39:14.860
extremely important.
 

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:17.106
There's one detail here,
there's one detail about the

00:39:17.106 --> 00:39:19.050
columns though I wonder if
anyone notices,

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.257
that make them different than
any other columns that we've

00:39:22.257 --> 00:39:23.719
seen thus far this term.
 

00:39:23.719 --> 00:39:25.849
Does anyone see what that is?
 

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.684
Student: 
&gt;.

00:39:31.684 --> 00:39:32.579
Prof: They definitely
don't--yes, good point.

00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:34.853
That wasn't the one I had in
mind, but you're absolutely

00:39:34.853 --> 00:39:37.333
right, and it leads to another
point I'm going to make in the

00:39:37.333 --> 00:39:38.449
not too distant future.
 

00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:39.730
They don't support anything.
 

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:42.693
They are used here--the
building is supported by the

00:39:42.693 --> 00:39:44.090
concrete construction.
 

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.920
The columns don't have any
support role whatsoever.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:50.329
They're there entirely for
decorative purposes.

00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:51.190
So, excellent point.
 

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.518
And still one more.
 

00:39:52.518 --> 00:39:54.190
Look at the facing of the
column.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:55.659
What does that tell you?
 

00:39:55.659 --> 00:39:58.070
What is it, what kind of facing?
 

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.010
Student:  Opus
incertum.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:02.014
Prof: Opus
incertum;

00:40:02.014 --> 00:40:03.170
which means what?
 

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.150
Student:  Concrete.
 

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.550
Prof: The columns are
made of concrete too.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:08.909
The columns are not made out of
stone,

00:40:08.909 --> 00:40:11.489
but the columns in this
instance--it's unusual--

00:40:11.489 --> 00:40:13.690
but the columns,
in this instance,

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:17.690
made out of concrete and also
faced with opus incertum

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:18.289
work.
 

00:40:18.289 --> 00:40:22.320
A view again of the complex,
just to make the point that as

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.282
at the Sanctuary of Jupiter
Anxur at Terracina there is an

00:40:26.282 --> 00:40:29.309
underground passageway,
a cryptoporticus.

00:40:29.309 --> 00:40:31.268
But in this case--and you can
see,

00:40:31.268 --> 00:40:33.385
it's on the left,
underneath the left side of the

00:40:33.385 --> 00:40:35.858
sanctuary--
but in this instance,

00:40:35.858 --> 00:40:39.731
interestingly enough,
this isn't just a storage area,

00:40:39.731 --> 00:40:41.119
it's actually a street.
 

00:40:41.119 --> 00:40:45.860
The ancient name for Tivoli was
Tibur, t-i-b-u-r.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:48.704
There was a street called the
Via Tiburtina,

00:40:48.704 --> 00:40:52.539
that made its way from Rome to
Tivoli, and this underground

00:40:52.539 --> 00:40:55.119
passageway was actually the
street.

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.800
The street ran underneath the
sanctuary.

00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.974
That street,
or that part of the street that

00:40:59.974 --> 00:41:03.190
ran under the sanctuary,
can still be seen today,

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.771
and you can see--
it looks almost like an

00:41:05.771 --> 00:41:08.050
underground subway or something
like that--

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:12.246
you can see barrel vaulted
area, with a series of niches

00:41:12.246 --> 00:41:14.699
over here,
probably for shops,

00:41:14.699 --> 00:41:19.001
so that along the way you could
stop and shop beneath the

00:41:19.001 --> 00:41:20.000
sanctuary.
 

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.550
So a street,
in this case,

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:28.056
that is part of the Via
Tiburtina, leading from Rome to

00:41:28.056 --> 00:41:29.179
Tivoli.
 

00:41:29.179 --> 00:41:33.039
I'd like to turn now to a
couple of buildings in Rome,

00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:37.132
back to Rome,
to look at first a building

00:41:37.132 --> 00:41:41.614
called the Tabularium,
that dates to around 78 B.C.,

00:41:41.614 --> 00:41:44.599
that was a very important
building in Rome,

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:46.980
because it was used to house
the state archives,

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.260
at that particular juncture.
 

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:52.030
It was put up by a man--we even
know who put it up--

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:54.960
a man by the name of Quintus
Lutatius Catullus,

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.050
and I've put his name on the
Monument List for you,

00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:02.820
and it was located on the north
side of the forum,

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.983
of the Roman Forum,
and the south slope of the

00:42:05.983 --> 00:42:07.250
Capitoline Hill.
 

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:11.072
And here I show you one of
these excellent Google Earth

00:42:11.072 --> 00:42:14.400
fly-over views of this part of
ancient Rome,

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.940
or what this part of ancient
Rome looks like today.

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.777
And we see the landmarks that
we've already pointed out:

00:42:20.777 --> 00:42:24.222
the Colosseum at the very top;
the Roman Forum lying in front

00:42:24.222 --> 00:42:27.219
of the Colosseum;
Mussolini's Via dei Fori

00:42:27.219 --> 00:42:29.530
Imperiali;
the Imperial Fora over here;

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:34.260
the Palatine Hill up here;
the Circus Maximus here;

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:37.222
the wedding cake,
so-called, of Victor Emmanuel,

00:42:37.222 --> 00:42:40.186
the modern building,
nineteenth-century building

00:42:40.186 --> 00:42:43.757
over here;
and then the Capitoline Hill,

00:42:43.757 --> 00:42:48.389
redesigned by Michelangelo,
with the oval piazza.

00:42:48.389 --> 00:42:51.300
The Tabularium is located right
here.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:56.409
It is again facing the forum,
the Roman Forum,

00:42:56.409 --> 00:43:02.429
but it is the back wall of one
of Michelangelo's palaces,

00:43:02.429 --> 00:43:05.530
the so-called Senatorial Palace
designed by Michelangelo.

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:08.543
What Michelangelo did is what
was done so often by later

00:43:08.543 --> 00:43:12.123
architects,
incorporated--didn't tear down

00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:16.795
the earlier Roman Tabularium--
but incorporated its wall as

00:43:16.795 --> 00:43:19.380
the back wall of his Senatorial
Palace,

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.018
and that's exactly what it
remains today.

00:43:22.018 --> 00:43:25.150
Here we see a view of the
Tabularium.

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:29.547
We're standing on the Forum
side, looking at what remains of

00:43:29.547 --> 00:43:32.581
the Tabularium,
and we can see some of the

00:43:32.581 --> 00:43:35.900
features that we've already been
discussing today.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:38.057
First of all,
let me point out that it is

00:43:38.057 --> 00:43:39.300
made out of concrete.
 

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.150
It's made out of concrete.
 

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.579
The building is concrete.
 

00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:46.458
But here in Rome they decided
not to use--opus incertum

00:43:46.458 --> 00:43:47.969
work was not the rage in Rome.
 

00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:50.860
Instead they were much more
interested in cut stone.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:56.059
And you can see that they have
used cut stone in this

00:43:56.059 --> 00:43:59.114
structure,
cut tufa stone--I think you can

00:43:59.114 --> 00:44:03.012
recognize the stone as tufa --
remember tufa is indigenous to

00:44:03.012 --> 00:44:04.300
the city of Rome.
 

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.699
Rome has a lot of fairly decent
tufa.

00:44:06.699 --> 00:44:11.340
They've used tufa here,
and they have used tufa work

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:15.800
also for the arcades above and
for the columns.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.793
The capitals are done in
travertine, added in travertine,

00:44:18.793 --> 00:44:21.789
considered the most important
part, so they used the more

00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:23.340
expensive material there.
 

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.076
But you can see here,
as at the Sanctuary of Hercules

00:44:27.076 --> 00:44:29.992
at Tivoli,
that we have this combination

00:44:29.992 --> 00:44:32.755
of arcades and columns --
and once again,

00:44:32.755 --> 00:44:36.001
as was already pointed out,
columns that have no structural

00:44:36.001 --> 00:44:39.346
purpose whatsoever,
columns that are there for pure

00:44:39.346 --> 00:44:40.289
decoration.
 

00:44:40.289 --> 00:44:45.137
And this scheme of arcades with
columns is going to become

00:44:45.137 --> 00:44:48.199
extremely important in the
future.

00:44:48.199 --> 00:44:52.083
One can go inside the
Tabularium today and see what

00:44:52.083 --> 00:44:54.570
remains of the state archives.
 

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.668
There are some very interesting
corridors and vaulting that one

00:44:58.668 --> 00:44:59.329
can see.
 

00:44:59.329 --> 00:45:01.574
And, by the way,
it's a nice place to go because

00:45:01.574 --> 00:45:04.251
there's also a panoramic window
on which one can get some

00:45:04.251 --> 00:45:07.273
spectacular views,
down over the Roman Forum,

00:45:07.273 --> 00:45:09.789
and some great pictures as
well,

00:45:09.789 --> 00:45:11.599
photographs as well.
 

00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:15.710
We're looking here at one of
the corridors of the Tabularium.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:19.170
You can see that the arches are
made out of stone,

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:21.869
supported by columns,
but in between them--

00:45:21.869 --> 00:45:24.210
there are a series of bays,
as you can see here--

00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:28.047
and in between them we have
domical ceilings that are made

00:45:28.047 --> 00:45:29.260
out of concrete.
 

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:32.492
So concrete used here,
combined--concrete for the

00:45:32.492 --> 00:45:34.800
domes--
combined with stone,

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.717
that the Romans were very--
handsome stone that was in Rome

00:45:39.717 --> 00:45:44.161
itself favored,
used for the arches and used to

00:45:44.161 --> 00:45:46.920
decorate the walls as well.
 

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.150
And what's interesting is that
we find in these corridors a

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:55.760
series of ramps and a series of
steps.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.907
And there's actually one
staircase that has sixty-six

00:45:58.907 --> 00:46:01.387
steps--I've counted
them--sixty-six steps,

00:46:01.387 --> 00:46:02.659
as well as ramps.
 

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:05.005
And what we see happening
here--and these are again

00:46:05.005 --> 00:46:07.943
covered by barrel vaults--
what we see happening here is

00:46:07.943 --> 00:46:10.740
the Romans paying a lot of
attention to varying the

00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:14.099
experience that you have when
you walk through buildings.

00:46:14.099 --> 00:46:16.429
Sometimes you're going to be
walking on a straight path,

00:46:16.429 --> 00:46:18.130
sometimes you're going to be
walking on a ramp,

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:20.139
sometimes you're going to be
walking on stairs,

00:46:20.139 --> 00:46:22.099
to vary that experience.
 

00:46:22.099 --> 00:46:25.201
And you're going to see
panoramas and so on along the

00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:29.018
way, to make it an experience to
go into a building and to wander

00:46:29.018 --> 00:46:30.510
around that building.
 

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:32.945
But we're also going to
see--and I'll show you this

00:46:32.945 --> 00:46:35.768
particularly in the last
structure we talk about today--

00:46:35.768 --> 00:46:40.210
we're also going to see the
Romans not hesitating to be the

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:43.398
controlling force,
that they very much were,

00:46:43.398 --> 00:46:46.748
and to establish certain
pre-determined paths that you

00:46:46.748 --> 00:46:47.760
have to take.
 

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.360
So you're having a varied
experience,

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.400
but you're kind of having it in
the way that the Romans want you

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:56.277
to have it,
and that's an interesting

00:46:56.277 --> 00:47:00.547
phenomenon that I hope we'll
think about together as we

00:47:00.547 --> 00:47:03.079
converse in the online forum.
 

00:47:03.079 --> 00:47:07.699
I want to show you one last
building in Rome today,

00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:10.231
before I show you the real
piÃ¨ce de

00:47:10.231 --> 00:47:13.280
rÃ©sistance of
concrete architecture of this

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.260
early period.
 

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.300
I'd like to show you one more
building in Rome.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.806
It's a later building,
and in some respects it belongs

00:47:18.806 --> 00:47:19.800
in a later lecture.
 

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.010
It's the Theater of Marcellus
in Rome,

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:25.650
a theater that was put up by
Rome's first emperor,

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:29.996
Augustus, after the death of
his nephew and son-in-law

00:47:29.996 --> 00:47:30.980
Marcellus.
 

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:34.309
He seems to have put it up,
that is, Augustus seems to have

00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:35.000
put it up.
 

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.527
He was in great grief at the
loss of this young man because

00:47:37.527 --> 00:47:39.619
he had hoped that Marcellus
would succeed him.

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:42.429
Marcellus was married to
Augustus's daughter,

00:47:42.429 --> 00:47:42.940
Julia.
 

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.559
He'd hoped that Marcellus would
succeed him, but Marcellus,

00:47:45.559 --> 00:47:47.050
unfortunately,
died very young.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.501
Augustus was in incredible
grief, and he put up this

00:47:50.501 --> 00:47:53.409
theater in Rome,
this stone theater in Rome,

00:47:53.409 --> 00:47:55.170
in honor of Marcellus.
 

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:57.811
The theater was put up,
as I mentioned,

00:47:57.811 --> 00:47:59.760
either in 13 or in 11 B.C.
 

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.936
So I can talk about this--we
have several lectures on

00:48:01.936 --> 00:48:03.826
Augustus--
and I can talk about this in

00:48:03.826 --> 00:48:06.442
that lecture,
but I decided to put it here

00:48:06.442 --> 00:48:09.050
because it really is the
culmination,

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:11.896
in a sense, of some of the
experiments we've been talking

00:48:11.896 --> 00:48:15.034
about today,
and I wanted you to see it in

00:48:15.034 --> 00:48:17.489
this context for that reason.
 

00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:21.550
We are looking at the Theater
of Marcellus as it looks today.

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.903
Parts of it are extremely well
preserved, as you can see,

00:48:24.903 --> 00:48:27.179
at least these first two tiers
here.

00:48:27.179 --> 00:48:30.768
The main reason that the
building has survived,

00:48:30.768 --> 00:48:33.159
and you can--well I'll talk
about the details in a moment--

00:48:33.159 --> 00:48:35.260
the main reason that the
building has survived--

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:38.849
and I believe I mentioned this
in the introductory lecture--

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:40.690
is that it was re-used over
time.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:46.469
It was re-used as a fortress in
the Middle Ages,

00:48:46.469 --> 00:48:48.960
it was used as a palace in the
Renaissance,

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.570
and it was used most recently,
and is still being used,

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.909
as a very luxurious condominium
today.

00:48:55.909 --> 00:48:58.469
This is where Google Earth
really comes in handy.

00:48:58.469 --> 00:49:01.795
If you go onto Google
Earth--because it's very

00:49:01.795 --> 00:49:06.452
difficult to get a sense of the
way in which the ancient part of

00:49:06.452 --> 00:49:11.110
this structure relates to the
rest of the structure today,

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.320
without going up above it.
 

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.739
And by going up above it,
and looking at it,

00:49:16.739 --> 00:49:20.039
both from above and--and Google
Earth now allows you to do 3D at

00:49:20.039 --> 00:49:23.038
the same time,
so you can do 3D and up above

00:49:23.038 --> 00:49:27.219
at the same time--
you can see the relationship of

00:49:27.219 --> 00:49:30.469
this building to its modern
locale.

00:49:30.469 --> 00:49:32.623
And, by the way,
it's just in the shadow,

00:49:32.623 --> 00:49:34.829
it's very close to the
Capitoline Hill;

00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:38.000
it's a hop, skip and a jump
from the Capitoline Hill,

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.219
this area of Rome.
 

00:49:39.219 --> 00:49:42.719
It's actually the so-called
Jewish Ghetto area of Rome--

00:49:42.719 --> 00:49:46.871
it served as a ghetto in times
past and is still referred to

00:49:46.871 --> 00:49:49.202
that way today--
and it has some of the best

00:49:49.202 --> 00:49:50.030
restaurants in Rome.
 

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:53.300
If you have never had
carciofi alla Judea,

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:56.300
Jewish artichokes,
wow, they are incredible,

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.385
and there are several,
lots of restaurants in this

00:49:58.385 --> 00:49:59.280
area that has them.
 

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.420
They're a real Roman treat.
 

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.429
It's considered a very
characteristic part of the

00:50:04.429 --> 00:50:07.751
cuisine of ancient Rome,
and it's definitely something

00:50:07.751 --> 00:50:08.880
to experience.
 

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:11.849
But we see the Theater of
Marcellus right here,

00:50:11.849 --> 00:50:15.599
and you can see,
both the faÃ§ade,

00:50:15.599 --> 00:50:19.284
which is the ancient part of
it, but also the rest of the

00:50:19.284 --> 00:50:23.364
building and the way in which it
is used today as a condominium

00:50:23.364 --> 00:50:26.983
with apartments opening off
these lovely courtyards with

00:50:26.983 --> 00:50:31.260
trees and plants and flowers and
all sorts of things there.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.159
And there's another famous
temple, the Temple of Apollo

00:50:34.159 --> 00:50:37.389
that is located right outside;
there are at least three

00:50:37.389 --> 00:50:40.664
columns preserved of that
temple, but also its podium

00:50:40.664 --> 00:50:43.559
right in front of the Theater of
Marcellus.

00:50:43.559 --> 00:50:45.309
This is again Google Earth.
 

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:48.266
You can look not only at what
the building looks like today,

00:50:48.266 --> 00:50:51.815
but you can re-create;
now, in these last couple of

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:54.648
months,
they've enabled us to re-create

00:50:54.648 --> 00:50:57.505
ancient Rome as well,
and one can do that for all of

00:50:57.505 --> 00:50:59.920
the buildings that we'll be
looking at this semester,

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:02.463
and this one is their
re-creation--it's fairly

00:51:02.463 --> 00:51:04.844
simple--
but their re-creation of the

00:51:04.844 --> 00:51:06.268
Theater of Marcellus.
 

00:51:06.268 --> 00:51:10.643
And it allows us to look at
some of the features of that

00:51:10.643 --> 00:51:11.518
building.
 

00:51:11.518 --> 00:51:15.003
Again, sorry that I have to
talk so much about terminology

00:51:15.003 --> 00:51:16.994
at the beginning but,
as I mentioned,

00:51:16.994 --> 00:51:18.864
once we get through this,
the first couple of weeks,

00:51:18.864 --> 00:51:20.360
we won't have to do much of
that anymore.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:26.070
But the basic components of a
Roman theater were the seating,

00:51:26.070 --> 00:51:27.882
which is called the
cavea,

00:51:27.882 --> 00:51:30.440
c-a-v-e-a,
which is this semicircular

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.260
seating that we see here.
 

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.298
The cavea is usually
divided into a series of

00:51:35.298 --> 00:51:37.791
wedge-shaped sections--
which you cannot see here,

00:51:37.791 --> 00:51:39.639
but I'll show you in another
view in a moment--

00:51:39.639 --> 00:51:41.969
wedge-shaped sections that are
called,

00:51:41.969 --> 00:51:44.197
each are called the
cuneus,

00:51:44.197 --> 00:51:48.010
c-u-n-e-u-s,
cuneus.

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.920
And then there is a stage
building--

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.849
we're seeing the back of that
here--

00:51:51.849 --> 00:51:54.340
but a stage building facing the
seating,

00:51:54.340 --> 00:52:00.320
called a scaenae frons,
s-c-a-e-n-a-e f-r-o-n-s,

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.889
a scaenae frons.
 

00:52:01.889 --> 00:52:05.239
What's important to us here,
in the context of this lecture,

00:52:05.239 --> 00:52:09.480
is that while the Greeks built
their theaters--

00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:13.543
and Greek theaters were the
main prototype for Roman

00:52:13.543 --> 00:52:16.061
theaters--
while the Greeks built their

00:52:16.061 --> 00:52:20.309
theaters on hillsides,
the Romans were not content,

00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:26.023
as a civilization that was
interested primarily in urban

00:52:26.023 --> 00:52:29.246
centers,
the Romans were not content to

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:31.289
build their theaters on hills.
 

00:52:31.289 --> 00:52:34.190
They didn't want to be
constrained by having to build

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:36.699
their theaters where hills
happened to be,

00:52:36.699 --> 00:52:39.099
and so now, with concrete
construction,

00:52:39.099 --> 00:52:42.273
what they were able to do
instead was to build a hill out

00:52:42.273 --> 00:52:46.130
of concrete anywhere they wanted
to build a hill out of concrete,

00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:47.949
right in the center of downtown
Rome,

00:52:47.949 --> 00:52:52.014
and then hollow that concrete
out in order to create the

00:52:52.014 --> 00:52:55.119
entrances and exits from that
structure.

00:52:55.119 --> 00:52:58.820
And that's exactly what they
did for the Theater of

00:52:58.820 --> 00:52:59.710
Marcellus.
 

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:02.184
If we look at this detail of
the outside of the Theater of

00:53:02.184 --> 00:53:04.822
Marcellus,
we will see that this building,

00:53:04.822 --> 00:53:07.755
made out of concrete,
is, like the others we've

00:53:07.755 --> 00:53:13.268
talked about today,
faced with some kind of stone.

00:53:13.268 --> 00:53:15.670
In this case the stone is
travertine.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:20.146
The decision of Augustus was to
get this more expensive stone,

00:53:20.146 --> 00:53:24.110
bring it from Tivoli,
and use it for this structure.

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:27.186
Blocks of stone,
ashlar blocks of stone,

00:53:27.186 --> 00:53:30.184
as you can see here,
and interspersing,

00:53:30.184 --> 00:53:32.630
among the arcades,
columns;

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.534
columns that,
as were pointed out before,

00:53:35.534 --> 00:53:38.440
have no structural purpose
whatsoever;

00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:42.242
columns that serve only as
decoration, and the fact that

00:53:42.242 --> 00:53:46.253
they were decoration is apparent
in the fact that they have

00:53:46.253 --> 00:53:48.119
varied the orders here.
 

00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:51.668
We see the Doric order used for
the first story and the Ionic

00:53:51.668 --> 00:53:55.159
order used for the second story,
and we think there may have

00:53:55.159 --> 00:53:58.231
been a third story;
today what you see up there is

00:53:58.231 --> 00:54:00.059
part of the later construction.
 

00:54:00.059 --> 00:54:03.188
But if there was a third story,
whether that had columns or

00:54:03.188 --> 00:54:05.914
pilasters,
which you'll remember are flat

00:54:05.914 --> 00:54:07.438
columns,
if it had those,

00:54:07.438 --> 00:54:09.829
those were probably of the
Corinthian order.

00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:13.324
Because that is exactly the
scheme that we see on the later

00:54:13.324 --> 00:54:15.614
Colosseum: Doric,
Ionic and alternately

00:54:15.614 --> 00:54:16.518
Corinthian.
 

00:54:16.518 --> 00:54:19.320
But we're sure at least of the
Doric and of the Ionic.

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:22.400
So these columns have no
structural purpose whatsoever;

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.539
purely decorative.
 

00:54:23.539 --> 00:54:26.579
In a sense they're kind of the
icing on the cake.

00:54:26.579 --> 00:54:29.871
They don't hold up the building
but they decorate it in a very

00:54:29.871 --> 00:54:31.797
nice way,
and it shows you that the

00:54:31.797 --> 00:54:34.913
Romans are beginning to use what
the Greeks used as structural

00:54:34.913 --> 00:54:37.606
components of their buildings,
namely columns,

00:54:37.606 --> 00:54:39.969
to hold up walls,
to hold up roofs,

00:54:39.969 --> 00:54:42.940
they are using them for purely
decorative purposes,

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:46.206
playing around with their
original purpose and using them

00:54:46.206 --> 00:54:49.791
in a different way,
and we see that happening in

00:54:49.791 --> 00:54:50.860
spades here.
 

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:55.753
If you go into the building you
will see the corridors of the

00:54:55.753 --> 00:54:57.630
Theater of Marcellus.
 

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.833
You will see what first looks
like a barrel vault,

00:55:00.833 --> 00:55:02.992
done out of concrete
construction,

00:55:02.992 --> 00:55:05.739
resting on stone,
on travertine piers.

00:55:05.739 --> 00:55:08.550
But you see that that barrel
vault curves.

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:12.161
A curving barrel vault is
technically called an annular

00:55:12.161 --> 00:55:13.699
vault, a-n-n-u-l-a-r.
 

00:55:13.699 --> 00:55:17.871
You see an annular vault here,
or a diagram of an annular

00:55:17.871 --> 00:55:18.840
vault here.
 

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:21.690
It's essentially again a barrel
vault that curves.

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:25.400
We sometimes refer to it as a
ring vault, because of its

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:25.940
shape.
 

00:55:25.940 --> 00:55:30.032
So you see those annular vaults
used in the Theater of

00:55:30.032 --> 00:55:30.960
Marcellus.
 

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.360
These are the same vaults that
will be used ultimately in the

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.039
Colosseum.
 

00:55:35.039 --> 00:55:39.029
A quick view of a typical Roman
theater, the Theater of

00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:42.650
Marcellus in Rome,
and a typical Greek theater.

00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:45.972
This is the famous Theater at
Epidaurus, of the mid-fourth

00:55:45.972 --> 00:55:46.789
century B.C.
 

00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:47.590
in Greece.
 

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:50.260
And I show you -- just wanted
to point out the main

00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.010
differences.
 

00:55:51.010 --> 00:55:55.570
They look superficially alike
in that both of them have an

00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:58.503
orchestra,
they have an area of seats,

00:55:58.503 --> 00:56:02.527
they have a stage building,
but there are some important

00:56:02.527 --> 00:56:03.449
differences.
 

00:56:03.449 --> 00:56:06.873
One is--and you can't see that
over here -- but the Greek

00:56:06.873 --> 00:56:10.641
theater had a round orchestra;
the Roman theater always has a

00:56:10.641 --> 00:56:12.090
semicircular orchestra.
 

00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:15.059
Both of them have seats,
the cavea.

00:56:15.059 --> 00:56:18.186
Here you can see these
wedge-shaped sections of seats

00:56:18.186 --> 00:56:21.375
called the cuneus,
that both Greek theaters and

00:56:21.375 --> 00:56:23.059
also Roman theaters had.
 

00:56:23.059 --> 00:56:25.740
Both of them have stage
buildings, although the stage

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.320
building is more prominent in
the Roman context.

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.324
But the most important
distinction is the one I've

00:56:30.324 --> 00:56:31.590
already drawn,
and that is,

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:34.893
as you can see at Epidaurus,
the Greeks build their theaters

00:56:34.893 --> 00:56:37.204
on hilltops;
you can see the trees and part

00:56:37.204 --> 00:56:38.780
of the hill very clearly here.
 

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:42.148
The Romans build theirs on
hills made out of concrete --

00:56:42.148 --> 00:56:45.090
not always, there are some
exceptions to that.

00:56:45.090 --> 00:56:47.440
We do have some Roman theaters
built on hills,

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.739
when the hill happened to be in
a good location and particularly

00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:53.411
beautifully sited,
but for the most part Romans

00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:56.050
build them on their own concrete
construction.

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:59.699
I've mentioned the Monument of
Victor Emmanuel,

00:56:59.699 --> 00:57:01.967
the Vittoriano,
and I just wanted to say a

00:57:01.967 --> 00:57:04.070
couple more words about it
because--

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:06.969
and you'll see how it fits into
the context here in a moment--

00:57:06.969 --> 00:57:09.409
because it's a
nineteenth-century building.

00:57:09.409 --> 00:57:15.222
And it's a building that was
put up to honor the first king

00:57:15.222 --> 00:57:17.829
of the kingdom of Italy.
 

00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:20.768
His name was Victor Emmanuel I.
 

00:57:20.768 --> 00:57:24.570
It was put up in 1885,
and you see it here,

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:28.010
again, a major landmark in the
city.

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:30.489
This is a Google Earth image
once again.

00:57:30.489 --> 00:57:34.329
But the reason I show it to you
in this context today is that it

00:57:34.329 --> 00:57:38.050
is in a sense terraced on the
slope of the Capitoline Hill.

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:40.329
You see Michelangelo's oval
piazza up there.

00:57:40.329 --> 00:57:43.880
It's terraced on the slope,
a series of levels.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.161
Staircases leading to terraces,
leading to other terraces,

00:57:47.161 --> 00:57:49.981
leading to the top of the
building, decorated with

00:57:49.981 --> 00:57:50.730
statuary.
 

00:57:50.730 --> 00:57:52.329
It's a real experience to climb
up it.

00:57:52.329 --> 00:57:54.210
It's an amazing place to go.
 

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:58.219
It has the Tomb of the Italian
Unknown Soldier here,

00:57:58.219 --> 00:58:02.860
with guards and an eternal
flame and all of those things.

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:05.586
And I must add,
for any of you who have not

00:58:05.586 --> 00:58:09.956
been in Rome in the last year,
and who are hoping to go

00:58:09.956 --> 00:58:12.724
sometime soon,
or whenever in the future,

00:58:12.724 --> 00:58:15.394
they have just added,
on top of the Victor--it was

00:58:15.394 --> 00:58:18.849
always a great place to climb up
and see great views of Rome--

00:58:18.849 --> 00:58:20.840
but they have just added an
elevator,

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.969
a modern elevator that they've
created,

00:58:22.969 --> 00:58:25.918
that you can now take up,
taking you even higher than you

00:58:25.918 --> 00:58:27.500
were ever able to go before.
 

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.797
The views of Rome from there
are among the most spectacular

00:58:30.797 --> 00:58:32.559
that one can see in the city.
 

00:58:32.559 --> 00:58:36.559
So I happened--unfortunately
when I was there this past June

00:58:36.559 --> 00:58:38.992
it was raining,
and it doesn't rain in Rome

00:58:38.992 --> 00:58:42.581
that often at that time of year,
but it was, so many of the

00:58:42.581 --> 00:58:47.577
pictures that I took are sort of
a grey background and so on and

00:58:47.577 --> 00:58:48.530
so forth.
 

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:51.311
But nonetheless some of the
most spectacular views you can

00:58:51.311 --> 00:58:52.190
see of the city.
 

00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:55.159
So don't miss out on that
opportunity.

00:58:55.159 --> 00:58:58.313
But I show it to you in this
context because of all of this

00:58:58.313 --> 00:58:59.510
terracing up a hill.
 

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:03.579
The idea for this kind of thing
goes way back to the second

00:59:03.579 --> 00:59:06.527
century B.C.,
and comes from buildings like

00:59:06.527 --> 00:59:07.440
this one.
 

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:11.001
This is, without any question,
the masterpiece of Roman

00:59:11.001 --> 00:59:13.985
concrete architecture,
concrete construction,

00:59:13.985 --> 00:59:17.063
sanctuary design,
in the second and first

00:59:17.063 --> 00:59:18.320
centuries B.C.
 

00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.130
We're not absolutely sure of
its date.

00:59:20.130 --> 00:59:23.963
For a long time--this is,
by the way, the Sanctuary of

00:59:23.963 --> 00:59:27.579
Fortuna Primigenia,
at a town called Palestrina.

00:59:27.579 --> 00:59:29.400
The date is very controversial.
 

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.889
There are many who long
associated it with the Roman

00:59:32.889 --> 00:59:35.762
general Sulla,
and said that it dated to 80

00:59:35.762 --> 00:59:36.309
B.C.
 

00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:39.646
There are others who have
contended that it's much earlier

00:59:39.646 --> 00:59:42.307
than that;
it dates to the second century

00:59:42.307 --> 00:59:44.175
B.C,
and if it dates to the second

00:59:44.175 --> 00:59:46.117
century B.C,
it's even more amazing,

00:59:46.117 --> 00:59:49.427
because that means it comes at
the beginning rather than at the

00:59:49.427 --> 00:59:51.561
end of this second and first
century B.C.

00:59:51.561 --> 00:59:52.469
development.
 

00:59:52.469 --> 00:59:55.400
I tend now--I've gone back and
forth.

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:58.340
I taught it as a Sullan
building for quite awhile.

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.563
Now I've been teaching it the
last few years as a

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.768
second-century building.
 

01:00:01.768 --> 01:00:03.119
It probably doesn't matter all
that much;

01:00:03.119 --> 01:00:06.684
it dates to one or the other
and it's an example of what was

01:00:06.684 --> 01:00:08.800
going on at that particular
time.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:12.800
But I'm giving you a date this
year as second century B.C.,

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.362
which I think,
at this juncture,

01:00:14.362 --> 01:00:17.217
is probably--
my personal opinion is that's

01:00:17.217 --> 01:00:19.170
probably where it belongs.
 

01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:20.710
You're looking at it here.
 

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:24.449
It is an incredible--it is part
of an incredible hill town.

01:00:24.449 --> 01:00:27.731
Just like Cori,
the city of Palestrina is a

01:00:27.731 --> 01:00:29.449
beautiful hill town.
 

01:00:29.449 --> 01:00:33.530
You can see it here with all
the wonderful red roofs of the

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:36.909
town that tie the design of the
town together.

01:00:36.909 --> 01:00:41.188
The culminating monument of
that town is still the Sanctuary

01:00:41.188 --> 01:00:42.929
of Fortuna Primigenia.
 

01:00:42.929 --> 01:00:47.731
Once again the Romans have
found a spectacular locale for

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:51.503
this sanctuary cum theater cum
shopping mall,

01:00:51.503 --> 01:00:55.789
Mecca for Romans of its day,
on this hillside.

01:00:55.789 --> 01:01:00.460
Once again they have in fact
taken over the entire hillside.

01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.289
They have terraced the
hillside, as we can see,

01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:07.240
and they've essentially poured
concrete on that hillside to

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:11.193
create a system of ramps and
stairways and with a temple at

01:01:11.193 --> 01:01:12.420
the very apex.
 

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.929
It is pretty well preserved
today.

01:01:13.929 --> 01:01:16.559
You can see there's an awful
lot of it still there.

01:01:16.559 --> 01:01:21.025
If you're coming by car,
you can either park down here

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:24.242
or up there,
and you can make your way up

01:01:24.242 --> 01:01:26.909
the ramps,
up the staircase to the various

01:01:26.909 --> 01:01:29.534
levels,
and then up to the theatrical

01:01:29.534 --> 01:01:32.210
entranceway into the uppermost
part.

01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:36.117
The Temple of Fortuna herself,
which was at the apex and was

01:01:36.117 --> 01:01:39.824
located probably in what may
have been a kind of mountain

01:01:39.824 --> 01:01:42.226
alcove,
at that particular time,

01:01:42.226 --> 01:01:45.239
was transformed in the
seventeenth century,

01:01:45.239 --> 01:01:49.099
by the famous Barberini
family--famous Italian family;

01:01:49.099 --> 01:01:51.449
popes came from that family and
so on--

01:01:51.449 --> 01:01:54.000
transformed into--they were
very smart too--

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.059
transformed into a nice little
palace that they could go and

01:01:57.059 --> 01:01:58.768
stay in when they felt like it.
 

01:01:58.768 --> 01:02:02.217
A small palace but one that
takes the exact shape of that

01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:04.309
uppermost part of the sanctuary.
 

01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:05.840
I'll show that to you in a
moment.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:07.659
Here's a view from Google Earth.
 

01:02:07.659 --> 01:02:09.599
You can see Google Earth
doesn't always work.

01:02:09.599 --> 01:02:12.445
When you go out to some of the
smaller places,

01:02:12.445 --> 01:02:16.429
it's hard to zero in on it well
enough to get a decent focus.

01:02:16.429 --> 01:02:18.518
But you can see it actually
here.

01:02:18.518 --> 01:02:23.018
You can go to Palestrina and
see it on Google Earth.

01:02:23.018 --> 01:02:26.572
These are the various tiers,
with the palace at the

01:02:26.572 --> 01:02:27.780
uppermost part.
 

01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:31.353
Here's a restored view--it's on
your Monument List--that gives

01:02:31.353 --> 01:02:34.869
you a sense of what the building
looked like in antiquity.

01:02:34.869 --> 01:02:38.358
You can see the entranceway was
down here, a small arched

01:02:38.358 --> 01:02:39.230
entranceway.
 

01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:42.139
But you really needed to go up
the ramps.

01:02:42.139 --> 01:02:44.090
You could go up on either side.
 

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:48.050
So we see this composite,
just like we saw at the

01:02:48.050 --> 01:02:52.918
Tabularium, this combination of
ramps and staircases to make

01:02:52.918 --> 01:02:55.588
your way up;
varied experiences,

01:02:55.588 --> 01:02:58.710
but at the same time a
pre-determined path.

01:02:58.710 --> 01:03:01.690
Because while you had some
choice when you first arrived,

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:04.800
you could go up the ramp on
either left and right--

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:07.170
and you can see it was a
covered ramp in antiquity--

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:09.750
but when you got here you had
one choice,

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.989
you had to go up the stairway,
to this level,

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:14.630
and then there were some shops
here you could explore.

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:16.260
But then if you wanted to go up
to the next level,

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.639
you had to go back to the
central stairway,

01:03:17.639 --> 01:03:20.739
up to this level,
back to the central stairway,

01:03:20.739 --> 01:03:24.751
and then to the stairway in the
shape of a theater at the

01:03:24.751 --> 01:03:25.969
uppermost part.
 

01:03:25.969 --> 01:03:29.235
So again, experience is
stressed, your experience of the

01:03:29.235 --> 01:03:32.324
building was stressed,
but at the same time your path

01:03:32.324 --> 01:03:34.760
was determined by the Roman
designer.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.190
This is another view of the
same, where we can see the

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:41.619
entranceway, the ramps,
the staircase leading you from

01:03:41.619 --> 01:03:44.090
one to the other;
the uppermost staircase.

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:46.699
Here you can well see the
theatrical --

01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:51.291
the way in which the theater,
the semi-circular theater is

01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:55.320
used both as an attractive
entrance stairway to the

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:58.224
structure,
but at the same time as a place

01:03:58.224 --> 01:04:00.739
where performances could
actually take place.

01:04:00.739 --> 01:04:03.570
Then what's called a hemicycle.
 

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:07.215
You see several hemicycles here;
h-e-m-i-c-y-c-l-e,

01:04:07.215 --> 01:04:09.289
these curved areas.
 

01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:11.280
The columns follow that curve.
 

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:17.193
You see that hemicycle at the
very top, and then at the apex

01:04:17.193 --> 01:04:21.804
of the structure the shrine of
Fortuna herself,

01:04:21.804 --> 01:04:24.309
a small round shrine.
 

01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:28.070
In fact it's almost an
anticlimax to see how small the

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:31.690
shrine at the uppermost part of
the structure is.

01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:33.940
How did the Romans achieve this?
 

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.492
They created,
as you can see here,

01:04:36.492 --> 01:04:40.827
a series--or they converted the
hillside into a series of

01:04:40.827 --> 01:04:42.530
man-made terraces.
 

01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:45.898
They built those terraces up,
in some instances,

01:04:45.898 --> 01:04:47.260
by barrel vaults.
 

01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:50.657
You can see the series of
concrete barrel vaults here,

01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:53.989
as they have built some
elements up along the way.

01:04:53.989 --> 01:04:59.590
And the ultimate result was
what you see here --

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:01.420
the same sort of thing we saw
before,

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:05.208
the ramps, the staircase,
the hemicycles with columns

01:05:05.208 --> 01:05:09.068
supporting a curved wall,
a series of shops,

01:05:09.068 --> 01:05:13.210
the spectacular theater-like
staircase,

01:05:13.210 --> 01:05:16.309
the curved hemicycle at the
uppermost part,

01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:21.380
and then peaking up at the top
the Temple of Fortuna herself.

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.557
It's hard to conjure up in a
classroom in New Haven the

01:05:24.557 --> 01:05:28.148
actual experience that one has
when one goes to Palestrina and

01:05:28.148 --> 01:05:31.867
climbs through this structure,
and it's not as well preserved

01:05:31.867 --> 01:05:34.570
today as it once was,
obviously, in antiquity.

01:05:34.570 --> 01:05:37.465
But in the few minutes that
remain I want to try to

01:05:37.465 --> 01:05:40.710
recapture, or try to take you
through that experience.

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:43.809
We're obviously--and to show
you how arduous it actually was.

01:05:43.809 --> 01:05:46.697
It's a climb up there,
and in fact this is one of

01:05:46.697 --> 01:05:49.963
those examples,
and there are many in Italy,

01:05:49.963 --> 01:05:54.099
that one likes to call
Stairmasters made by nature,

01:05:54.099 --> 01:05:57.768
essentially -- places that you
can go and you can put,

01:05:57.768 --> 01:06:01.001
exert a lot of effort into
making your way to the top of

01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:02.000
this sanctuary.
 

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:07.300
The best natural Stairmaster in
Italy is of course--

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:09.190
any of you who have been along
the Amalfi Coast,

01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:11.777
know there's nowhere on the
Amalfi Coast that you don't have

01:06:11.777 --> 01:06:14.199
to climb up and down,
at multiple times of day.

01:06:14.199 --> 01:06:17.239
And that's exactly what's
happening here.

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:21.541
And you can see how steep this
path up the ramp was,

01:06:21.541 --> 01:06:24.579
and we're going up the ramp
again.

01:06:24.579 --> 01:06:25.530
It was covered in antiquity.
 

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:27.179
It's open to the sky today.
 

01:06:27.179 --> 01:06:31.378
As we go along the ramp we see
the remnants of some of the

01:06:31.378 --> 01:06:32.190
capitals.
 

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:36.603
These are travertine capitals,
as you can see here,

01:06:36.603 --> 01:06:37.840
fallen down.
 

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.416
But if you look at some of
these capitals in detail,

01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:42.286
you see something quite
extraordinary,

01:06:42.286 --> 01:06:44.460
and that is the capital isn't
straight.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.730
The uppermost part of the
capital slopes.

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:48.500
Now why is that?
 

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.135
The reason that is,
is because if you're going to

01:06:51.135 --> 01:06:53.768
put columns along the inner wall
of the ramp,

01:06:53.768 --> 01:06:55.909
which is what they did,
the column--

01:06:55.909 --> 01:07:01.730
the capitals--have to conform
to the incline of the ramp,

01:07:01.730 --> 01:07:06.670
and so they have slanted those
capitals.

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:09.496
The whole idea though of
changing--the Greeks would never

01:07:09.496 --> 01:07:12.856
do something like that;
it would be sacrilege to change

01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:14.480
the shape of a capital.
 

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.550
But this Roman architect has
done that with abandon here.

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:18.853
He needed to do it,
because he needed to fit it

01:07:18.853 --> 01:07:20.101
into the scheme,
although he could've not had

01:07:20.101 --> 01:07:21.318
columns there,
but he wanted to have columns

01:07:21.318 --> 01:07:21.659
there.
 

01:07:21.659 --> 01:07:23.980
So he slanted them.
 

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:27.567
This whole, this sort of
sacrilegious approach to

01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:31.079
traditional Greek and Etruscan
architecture,

01:07:31.079 --> 01:07:34.380
the willingness to change
things, to experiment--

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.179
I told you this was a change
you believe in--

01:07:36.179 --> 01:07:39.099
the willingness to change these
things,

01:07:39.099 --> 01:07:42.210
to experiment with them in ways
that had never been done before,

01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:45.710
to go against the tenets of
traditional ancient

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:48.097
architecture,
namely that of the Greeks and

01:07:48.097 --> 01:07:50.047
Etruscans,
is something quintessentially

01:07:50.047 --> 01:07:52.530
Roman and something that we see
happening here,

01:07:52.530 --> 01:07:56.010
and again heralds a very
innovative future.

01:07:56.010 --> 01:07:58.820
Here we see again the ramp,
we see the capitals,

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:02.103
the slant of the capitals,
and we see that the work here

01:08:02.103 --> 01:08:04.289
was done,
was concrete faced with opus

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:07.163
incertum,
both for the walls and also for

01:08:07.163 --> 01:08:08.139
the ceilings.
 

01:08:08.139 --> 01:08:10.599
As one makes one's way up the
ramps,

01:08:10.599 --> 01:08:14.150
we see these alcoves,
all of this done--

01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:16.390
the various shops,
the alcoves--all of it done

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:18.779
with concrete faced with opus
incertum.

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:21.500
We see the remains of the
hemicycles.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:26.128
You can see the columns made of
tufa with travertine capitals

01:08:26.128 --> 01:08:29.908
supporting this curved attic of
the hemicycles.

01:08:29.908 --> 01:08:34.720
We see the vaulting with its
concrete construction.

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:39.210
This is an annular vault once
again, where we can see the

01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:43.460
facing in the coffers is opus
incertum work.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:47.340
Another view of that,
both the wall and the annular

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:51.220
vault, decorated with opus
incertum work;

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.309
a detail of that opus
incertum work to show you

01:08:54.309 --> 01:08:56.000
how very attractive it was.
 

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.667
It's a pity that it was
stuccoed over in ancient Roman

01:08:58.667 --> 01:08:59.069
times.
 

01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:02.351
A view that I took again just
to give you a sense of how steep

01:09:02.351 --> 01:09:03.158
the climb is.
 

01:09:03.158 --> 01:09:05.670
You've made it up the ramp,
now you're at the central

01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:07.359
staircase, you're on your way
up.

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:08.328
It's very, very steep.
 

01:09:08.328 --> 01:09:14.707
The stairways are pretty--are
short, so that it's a very

01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:18.069
arduous trip up,
as I said.

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:21.077
And then you can get a sense of
the fact that you would've seen

01:09:21.077 --> 01:09:22.920
the Sanctuary of Fortuna at the
top;

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.229
now you see the embracing arms
of the Barberini Palace,

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:29.752
but you can see those arms
follow the exact shape of the

01:09:29.752 --> 01:09:32.380
original hemicycle that was once
there.

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.634
And you can also see the
theater staircase very well

01:09:35.634 --> 01:09:38.810
preserved;
and I show you a detail of that

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:42.463
theater staircase,
leading into the doorway into

01:09:42.463 --> 01:09:44.020
the museum today.
 

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:47.920
And just in closing,
a return to the restored view

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:53.529
of the structure itself,
with the temple or the shrine

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:58.851
of Fortuna at the very apex,
a shrine that unfortunately no

01:09:58.851 --> 01:09:59.840
longer survives.
 

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:03.550
But I think as you look at this
last view of this monument,

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:07.007
you can see that what the
architects have created through

01:10:07.007 --> 01:10:09.582
this terracing,
through pouring concrete on

01:10:09.582 --> 01:10:13.414
this spectacular hillside,
is a kind of a pyramid,

01:10:13.414 --> 01:10:18.448
a kind of a pyramid with the
goddess at the apex;

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:22.831
a pyramid that I would contend
was more extraordinary through

01:10:22.831 --> 01:10:26.920
what the Romans did with
concrete than what nature itself

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.279
had provided in the form of this
mountain.

01:10:30.279 --> 01:10:33.625
And it gives you an incredible
sense of what the Romans were

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:36.970
capable of doing in the second
and first centuries B.C.,

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:39.220
vis-Ã -vis concrete
architecture,

01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.676
experiments that again are
going to have a lasting impact

01:10:42.676 --> 01:10:46.255
on the architecture that we'll
be studying in the course of

01:10:46.255 --> 01:10:47.119
this term.
 

01:10:47.119 --> 01:10:47.939
Thank you.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:08.002
Prof: Last time we
looked at Canto XV of

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:12.782
Inferno,
the canto of Brunetto,

00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:15.336
the teacher of--
Dante's teacher,

00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:17.200
and the teacher of the
Florentines,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:25.800
and we pointed out the rhetoric
of the canto.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.170
After all, Brunetto is a master
rhetorician,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.681
so it was quite appropriate
that Dante's account of his

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:42.192
meeting with his teacher would
be carried out through a

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:45.458
careful,
very careful,

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:51.340
highlighting of the ambiguities
of language;

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.196
the way a language is used very
carefully to mean one thing for

00:00:56.196 --> 00:01:00.270
one order of experience:
Brunetto's for instance,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.272
anthropocentric,
political understanding of the

00:01:04.272 --> 00:01:09.320
world and then Dante's own
understanding of the world which

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.816
we could call theological,
but it really means the point

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:16.110
of view of someone who is
questing,

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.080
who is moving and who will move
beyond Brunetto.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.040
And how a language oscillates.
 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.132
The same words seem to acquire
different meanings in those

00:01:27.132 --> 00:01:29.010
different contexts.
 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.950
In many ways,
that language would become,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.043
that language,
that rhetoric,

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:38.680
which should be the instrument
of persuasion and agreement,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.525
becomes in and of itself the
cause of two of the

00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:51.260
misunderstandings between them,
between master and disciple.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.800
The canto, Brunetto,
for all of its--

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.501
the intensity and poignancy of
a personal confrontation of a

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:07.010
disciple who meets his teacher
and in many ways shows--

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.628
even there, there is a great
deal of ambivalence,

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:12.597
a great deal of
acknowledgement,

00:02:12.597 --> 00:02:18.818
a recognition of the importance
of Brunetto's teaching on him,

00:02:18.818 --> 00:02:23.229
but, at the same time a sort of
distance taking,

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.188
leave-taking from that teaching.
 

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:29.770
That too, though,
for all of its private quality,

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.673
the quality of the great
humanistic values of

00:02:33.673 --> 00:02:38.907
acknowledging a teaching that
shows the way to how man makes

00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:43.787
himself eternal,
that is anthropocentric as it

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:46.805
can be;
that kind of aphorism,

00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:52.366
in a way, which is the way
Dante seals the personality of

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:53.560
rhetoric.
 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.211
Yet, it always had--or actually
has as always this--and personal

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:03.158
encounters do in Dante,
a political focus.

00:03:03.158 --> 00:03:06.639
There was something a little
bit larger than their own

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.688
private story.
 

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:12.262
It is--the encounter between
them was placed within the

00:03:12.262 --> 00:03:14.038
crisis of Florence.
 

00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:18.068
The city of Florence,
the divisions between Guelfs

00:03:18.068 --> 00:03:21.820
and Ghibellines,
and then there's also the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.729
announcements to Dante by
Brunetto that he is going to go

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.490
into--
he's going to end up in exile.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.155
That the comfort,
the human bonds,

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:37.032
the comfort of the city and
family, and what not,

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:39.940
even that will be denied to
him.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.652
For Brunetto,
of course, that is also a

00:03:42.652 --> 00:03:46.723
strategy of thinking that
Dante's own experience is really

00:03:46.723 --> 00:03:50.252
the mirror image of his own,
because as you remember,

00:03:50.252 --> 00:03:52.699
and I said this at the
beginning of my remarks last

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:56.664
time,
Brunetto also experiences exile

00:03:56.664 --> 00:04:02.899
as he was in Roncesvalles,
the classical place of the most

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.128
traumatic experience in medieval
history,

00:04:07.128 --> 00:04:10.870
the place where the paladin,
Roland,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.088
in Italian, Orlando, and
the Carolingian drama,

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:19.990
the Charlemagne's soldiers are
defeated and Brunetto,

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:25.004
that's where he-- that's how he
views his own defeat in the city

00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:26.120
of Florence.
 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.699
So there was always a public
focus.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:32.654
The public focus was not just a
context for their relationship,

00:04:32.654 --> 00:04:36.812
but it was really a way of
shedding light on the very

00:04:36.812 --> 00:04:39.529
nature of their own divisions.
 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.259
It is as if the oscillations of
language that they experience in

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.538
the exchange between them are
really a consequence also of

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.682
larger divisions,
larger suspicions,

00:04:51.682 --> 00:04:56.904
that these characters living in
Florence entertained toward each

00:04:56.904 --> 00:04:57.649
other.
 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:02.446
I mentioned that because I'm
going to move today to Canto

00:05:02.446 --> 00:05:02.959
XIX.
 

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:04.100
We are taking quite a jump.
 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.439
We went through XVI;
we saw the flight on the back

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:11.619
of Geryon or some adumbration of
that flight on the back of

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:12.338
Geryon.
 

00:05:12.338 --> 00:05:16.800
Canto XVII, if you were to read
it on your own,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.709
it's an extraordinary canto.
 

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:26.399
It's the only time that Virgil
leaves Dante alone and Dante has

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:33.307
to meet the usurers and it is as
if he had to be left without any

00:05:33.307 --> 00:05:34.709
guidance.
 

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:39.144
It is as if he had to discover
by himself and by his own powers

00:05:39.144 --> 00:05:43.437
what those temptations are and
what the implications of usury

00:05:43.437 --> 00:05:44.940
would be for him.
 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.879
Let me be biographical,
a biographical resonance there,

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:55.553
in the sense that not only the
poet is edging toward the

00:05:55.553 --> 00:06:00.173
condition of the usurer,
engaged in illusory

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:03.649
recreations, illusory
productions,

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:08.932
but also a biographical
reference to Dante's own father

00:06:08.932 --> 00:06:13.139
who was engaged in that sort of
activity.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.495
Then we go through Canto XIX,
which is really a canto I don't

00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:19.310
want to talk about now.
 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.423
That's the point of my remarks
about--my recapitulations of

00:06:24.423 --> 00:06:26.980
what I said about Brunetto.
 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.374
Dante now takes a public voice,
not only he takes a--so you

00:06:32.374 --> 00:06:37.209
have an experience of the shifts
in his own voice.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:43.187
You do know the kind of romance
atmosphere and the encounter

00:06:43.187 --> 00:06:44.910
with Francesca.
 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.884
You do have the kind of
seminar-like tones that he uses

00:06:48.884 --> 00:06:53.374
in the encounter in Limbo with
the poets of antiquity where he

00:06:53.374 --> 00:06:57.863
either goes on talking about art
and the secrets of the craft,

00:06:57.863 --> 00:06:58.600
etc.
 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.194
Now Dante takes what I do not
hesitate to call a prophetic

00:07:04.194 --> 00:07:04.980
voice.
 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.350
He plays now,
he sees himself as a public

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.939
role.
 

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:13.639
The shift or the change,
the departure from the

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:19.769
political rhetorical tone used
in the encounter with Brunetto

00:07:19.769 --> 00:07:24.192
could not be more--
could not be sharper or more

00:07:24.192 --> 00:07:24.860
radical.
 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.377
This is an argument now that
engages him as a public figure,

00:07:30.377 --> 00:07:33.649
as it were, indeed,
as a prophet.

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:36.709
What does it mean to be a
prophet for Dante?

00:07:36.709 --> 00:07:42.470
What kind of--how can one take
on this sort of voice?

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:48.319
How does one go on talk--how
does a prophet talk like?

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:52.009
One thing that you may want to
keep in mind as I go on,

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:56.721
to understand this canto,
is that if clearly the pattern

00:07:56.721 --> 00:08:00.017
for all of this,
the model would be the

00:08:00.017 --> 00:08:04.769
prophetic voice in the Bible,
the biblical prophets.

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:08.353
Do not make a mistake of
thinking for a moment that

00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:11.579
prophets are those who foretell
the future;

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:13.709
that's not really their role.
 

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:15.860
In fact, Dante goes out of the
way,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.379
and I'm not going to talk about
that,

00:08:17.379 --> 00:08:19.629
we really haven't got time,
in Canto XX,

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:24.298
highlighting the differences as
it were between prophets and

00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:25.170
diviners.
 

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:29.125
The diviners are those who
foretell, predict the future,

00:08:29.125 --> 00:08:32.360
so if the prophets do not
foretell the future,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.798
what do they do?
 

00:08:33.798 --> 00:08:36.950
They are literally readers of
the present.

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:38.798
This is the point.
 

00:08:38.798 --> 00:08:43.066
For Dante, the biblical
prophets are those who read the

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:47.806
present history in its unfolding
from the perspective of what

00:08:47.806 --> 00:08:53.100
they perceive to have been God's
promise to Israel and to them.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.690
The prophets are,
in a way and I do not--

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:00.509
I don't say this in any way to
degrade them,

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:03.657
but on the contrary,
to highlight the importance of

00:09:03.657 --> 00:09:07.370
their intervention into the
present that you could call them

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.629
as commentators.
 

00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:12.221
Those who are in the true sense
of the word, those who remember,

00:09:12.221 --> 00:09:13.990
that's what a commentator is.
 

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:17.823
A commentator is an exercise of
memory, a way of bringing

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:20.700
ancient memories to bear on the
present.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.889
That's the way Dante
understands the prophetic voice.

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:28.318
Another little detail before we
go on with the canto,

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:31.418
you do not know,
some of you may know that Dante

00:09:31.418 --> 00:09:34.190
actually is a writer of many
epistles.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.038
He was a letter writer.
 

00:09:36.038 --> 00:09:39.980
We do not know the letters he
wrote on behalf of his patrons,

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.408
but we do know that the letters
that he wrote in his own name,

00:09:43.408 --> 00:09:47.580
and he would be writing letters
that the array of which is--

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.308
can be sometimes moving.
 

00:09:50.308 --> 00:09:53.083
For instance,
when he writes to a friend,

00:09:53.083 --> 00:09:57.177
he would like to attend the
funeral of his friend's wife and

00:09:57.177 --> 00:09:57.940
cannot.
 

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:01.644
He's practically begging
because he doesn't have the

00:10:01.644 --> 00:10:04.548
adequate clothes to go to the
funeral;

00:10:04.548 --> 00:10:09.000
so he's clearly begging for
some kind of assistance.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.172
He writes also letters that
probably never reached their

00:10:12.172 --> 00:10:12.980
destination.
 

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.813
He wrote letters,
for instance,

00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:17.750
to the Italian cardinals who
were in conclave.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.440
You understand what I mean when
I say "conclave."

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.149
A conclave means that they are
shut under key and kept in some

00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:27.433
place where they can make
decisions about electing from

00:10:27.433 --> 00:10:30.048
within themselves or from the
outside,

00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:34.149
a pope, and they could not
agree about whom to choose.

00:10:34.149 --> 00:10:37.754
He writes a letter,
a letter to the Italian

00:10:37.754 --> 00:10:42.389
cardinals and he begins the
letter addressing them,

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:47.950
saying perhaps all of you will
wonder who is this man,

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.450
who gives him the authority to
say--

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.360
to speak to us and address us
and spur us on to action.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:00.177
Doesn't he remember--this is
Dante speaking and attributing

00:11:00.177 --> 00:11:04.797
his thoughts to the cardinals--
the possible objection to the

00:11:04.797 --> 00:11:09.440
intervention of a layman's voice
within sacred things?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.330
Doesn't he remember the lesson
of the biblical prophet--

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:17.320
which he doesn't mention--the
name that's mentioned--

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.817
who, on seeing the ark of the
alliance being carried into the

00:11:22.817 --> 00:11:27.399
city of Jerusalem and seeing the
ark tottering,

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:30.700
he stretches his hand trying to
protect it,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.058
to make sure that it won't
collapse and it breaks into

00:11:34.058 --> 00:11:34.629
pieces?
 

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:39.474
And God intervenes and through
lightening and fulminates and

00:11:39.474 --> 00:11:40.870
then kills him.
 

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:44.908
Dante is aware of the danger of
taking on--

00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:47.600
that's the point--he goes on
saying,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.263
spurring them,
saying, I'm not really touching

00:11:49.263 --> 00:11:51.029
the ark,
I'm really spurring the oxen

00:11:51.029 --> 00:11:52.389
who are not going anywhere.
 

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:54.730
That's the substance of the
letter, but this does not

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.538
concern us here.
 

00:11:55.538 --> 00:11:59.192
But the point that concerns us
here is that in the background

00:11:59.192 --> 00:12:02.480
to this canto where he takes on
the prophetic voice.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.192
He's aware of the possible
profanation that he is engaged

00:12:07.192 --> 00:12:11.820
in, in addressing as he does the
so-called simonists.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.320
It's time to get into the canto
of the so-called simonists.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.058
Who are the simonists?
 

00:12:18.058 --> 00:12:22.092
In fact let me just--I was just
reading this little story,

00:12:22.092 --> 00:12:24.570
"The Sisters"
of Joyce.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:28.173
I have been reading that before
but I know that that is really a

00:12:28.173 --> 00:12:30.754
story of--
I don't know how many of you

00:12:30.754 --> 00:12:33.684
are English students,
students of English literature,

00:12:33.684 --> 00:12:34.840
but he writes this story.
 

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.234
This is a story about--it's
early twentieth-century version

00:12:39.234 --> 00:12:42.245
of simony,
and if someone of you might

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:46.450
want to write a paper connecting
"The Sisters,"

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.730
this beautiful gem of a story
by Joyce, and Canto XIX.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:55.017
You can, and you see the
differences that--between the

00:12:55.017 --> 00:12:56.149
two of them.
 

00:12:56.149 --> 00:12:59.360
The simonists are the followers.
 

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.437
It's a word,
like we said the Machiavellians

00:13:02.437 --> 00:13:05.158
for instance,
they are the followers of

00:13:05.158 --> 00:13:08.740
Machiavelli, those who think
like Machiavelli.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.519
The simonists are the followers
of Simon,

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:14.519
who was called a magus,
or a sorcerer,

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:18.106
or a magician,
Simon, and actually we call

00:13:18.106 --> 00:13:23.095
this phenomenon when you have a
name that gives or sort of

00:13:23.095 --> 00:13:26.769
creates a trend or a way of
thinking,

00:13:26.769 --> 00:13:28.600
it's called an eponym.
 

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.854
I thought that you might--from
the Greek, eponym.

00:13:31.854 --> 00:13:33.210
This is an eponym.
 

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.720
Simonists are the followers of
Simon, the magician.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:45.836
So it's--Dante's beginning this
story with reference to a

00:13:45.836 --> 00:13:53.230
founding event in the
constitution of the church.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:58.126
It goes back to the Acts of the
Apostles where there is this

00:13:58.126 --> 00:14:00.336
story that--
of a sorcerer,

00:14:00.336 --> 00:14:03.629
a man engaged in witchcraft and
illusions,

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:09.803
Simon who wants to buy the gift
of prophecy and the power of

00:14:09.803 --> 00:14:12.840
making miracles from Peter.
 

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.346
And therefore then he
challenges him to let's see who

00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:19.248
can fly, etc.,
and they go up on a tower and

00:14:19.248 --> 00:14:20.259
try to fly.
 

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:23.278
Simon, of course,
will go down and will die.

00:14:23.278 --> 00:14:28.100
What Dante is doing,
he's now encountering the popes

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.028
of his own time:
Nicholas V,

00:14:31.028 --> 00:14:34.567
Boniface VIII--one of the great
minds and a great jurist,

00:14:34.567 --> 00:14:35.389
by the way.
 

00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:39.410
In fact there are those
historians who really think that

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:43.504
Dante is badmouthing him,
that there's something personal

00:14:43.504 --> 00:14:45.480
but we can't quite see.
 

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:49.590
Boniface VIII and Clement
VI--V, I'm sorry.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:54.913
The three popes are under whom
Dante lived, who are engaged in

00:14:54.913 --> 00:14:55.700
simony.
 

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.629
What is simony?
 

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:57.850
It's a sacrilege.
 

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:01.730
Simony is the act,
exactly like Simon in the Acts

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.368
of the Apostles,
who wanted to buy the gift of

00:15:05.368 --> 00:15:06.418
prophecy.
 

00:15:06.418 --> 00:15:10.171
It is a sin,
whereby one can go on in making

00:15:10.171 --> 00:15:15.580
commerce of sacred things and
thereby engaging in blasphemy.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.703
The question then is,
what does Dante think the

00:15:19.703 --> 00:15:20.778
sacred is?
 

00:15:20.778 --> 00:15:25.220
It's a constant theme in his
reflections;

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.980
it's a constant theme of his
thoughts.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.460
What is the sacred?
 

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.759
How do we determine it?
 

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:33.159
What does it mean to violate
the sacred?

00:15:33.159 --> 00:15:35.168
Simon violates the sacred.
 

00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:38.510
The popes now,
who are of his own generation,

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:43.144
are engaged in the same kind of
blasphemy and the same kind of

00:15:43.144 --> 00:15:44.360
profanation.
 

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.057
In effect, let me just give you
a little detail that you might

00:15:48.057 --> 00:15:51.087
appreciate this ambiguity,
the other name of Peter,

00:15:51.087 --> 00:15:51.269
St.
 

00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:54.725
Peter, the guy with the two
keys we saw an illusion to him

00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:56.120
with Canto XIII.
 

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.479
The other name of Peter is
Simon, so in fact he's known as

00:16:00.479 --> 00:16:01.548
Simon Peter.
 

00:16:01.548 --> 00:16:05.678
It is as if by having this too,
the sorcerer,

00:16:05.678 --> 00:16:10.320
the magician called Simon and
the pope called Simon Peter,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.269
and this should be--whose
successors,

00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:15.990
the popes should be,
the first pope and the others.

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:21.370
He's--Dante's actually giving
us a sense of what we call,

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.408
forgive them,
the rhetorical term,

00:16:24.408 --> 00:16:27.787
a metonymic proximity,
a contiguity,

00:16:27.787 --> 00:16:29.860
a nearness between them.
 

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.691
The nearness between the
prophetic mode and the

00:16:33.691 --> 00:16:36.690
profanation of the prophetic
mode.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:42.158
How precarious is the boundary
line that divides the two?

00:16:42.158 --> 00:16:47.787
How precarious the divided line
that separates the sacred from

00:16:47.787 --> 00:16:50.740
the profanation of the sacred?
 

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.149
So this is really what Dante is
doing.

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:54.538
Let's see how he dramatizes all
of this.

00:16:54.538 --> 00:16:57.669
First of all and the question
that I raised with you is,

00:16:57.669 --> 00:16:58.980
how do prophets talk?
 

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.288
One thing that you will see
here is the apostrophe.

00:17:03.288 --> 00:17:07.380
This is a canto written in
terms of apostrophes.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:12.420
Look at this and we read the
canto, so I'm reading the canto.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:18.308
This is for the
transcriber--Canto XIX.

00:17:18.308 --> 00:17:25.190
"Ah, Simon Magus,"
see there is the apostrophe.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.869
Think about why the apostrophe.
 

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:27.539
What is an apostrophe?
 

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.000
"You his wretched
followers who,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.655
rapacious, prostitute for gold
and silver the things of God

00:17:38.655 --> 00:17:42.509
which should be brides of
righteousness."

00:17:42.509 --> 00:17:44.308
That's the definition of simony.
 

00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:48.983
Viewed as an adultery,
a corruption therefore of the

00:17:48.983 --> 00:17:53.750
chastity of the marriage between
God and the soul.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.888
"Now must the trumpet
sound for you,

00:17:56.888 --> 00:17:59.950
for your place is in the third
pouch.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:04.569
We were now at the next tomb
and had climbed to that part of

00:18:04.569 --> 00:18:09.660
the ridge which hangs right over
the middle of the ditch."

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.759
Another invocation we call it,
but it's--

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:17.798
I'm not so sure that we can
quite decide the difference

00:18:17.798 --> 00:18:21.605
between an invocation,
which is obviously a prayer,

00:18:21.605 --> 00:18:24.068
for an apostrophe,
a calling on,

00:18:24.068 --> 00:18:27.640
an address, that's what the
apostrophe is.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.785
"How great is the art Thou
showest, in Heaven,

00:18:30.785 --> 00:18:34.243
on earth, and in the evil
world, and how justly does Thy

00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:35.440
power dispense!
 

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.778
I saw along the sides and on
the bottom the livid stone full

00:18:40.778 --> 00:18:44.940
of holes all of one size and
each was round.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.580
They seemed to me of a width no
more or less than those that

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.862
were made in my beautiful St.
 

00:18:51.862 --> 00:18:54.378
John," the baptistery of
St.

00:18:54.378 --> 00:18:56.108
John in Florence.
 

00:18:56.108 --> 00:19:01.990
These are the wells where
baptisms take place;

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.558
they're usually octagonal in
shape.

00:19:04.558 --> 00:19:08.151
It was the eighth day,
the idea that the Resurrection

00:19:08.151 --> 00:19:09.740
is on the eighth day.
 

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:15.040
It's the idea of history based
on the seven days of creation,

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.308
the eighth day of the
Resurrection.

00:19:18.308 --> 00:19:19.116
"They...
 

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.917
were made in my beautiful St.
 

00:19:20.917 --> 00:19:23.588
John as fonts for baptism,
one of which,

00:19:23.588 --> 00:19:27.134
not many years ago,
I broke for one that was

00:19:27.134 --> 00:19:31.289
drowning in it--
and to this I set my seal,

00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:35.088
to clear the mind of
everyone."

00:19:35.088 --> 00:19:40.125
What Dante is doing is
acknowledging what could have

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:43.779
been seen as an act of
profanation.

00:19:43.779 --> 00:19:47.598
He broke one--which is really a
figurative,

00:19:47.598 --> 00:19:49.977
because they are huge and I
can't believe that he could

00:19:49.977 --> 00:19:52.661
have--
you need ten people to break

00:19:52.661 --> 00:19:56.685
these things apart--
so it's a figurative idea that

00:19:56.685 --> 00:20:01.164
he stretched his hand into holy
things and violated the holy

00:20:01.164 --> 00:20:03.825
things,
but he did it and that's the

00:20:03.825 --> 00:20:05.130
excuse he's giving.
 

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:09.200
He did it in order to save
someone's life.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.422
There is nothing
gratuitous--that's the point,

00:20:12.422 --> 00:20:15.430
in his own intervention as it
is called.

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.467
It's called an interventio
in sacris,

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:21.644
stretching the profane hands
into holy things,

00:20:21.644 --> 00:20:23.200
into safer things.
 

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:30.240
What he is really removing
himself from is the charge that

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.058
his act may appear purely
gratuitous.

00:20:35.058 --> 00:20:39.039
If it's not gratuitous what is
it driven by?

00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:40.460
Where does it come from?
 

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:43.315
If it's not--one can say well
it's a gratuitous act,

00:20:43.315 --> 00:20:46.730
which means you can dismiss it,
but this is not gratuitous.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.402
So what is the reason behind it
and he--if he's serious enough

00:20:50.402 --> 00:20:52.750
he should provide us the
description.

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.700
"From the mouth of each
projected,

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.040
of each projected the feet of a
sinner and the legs as far as

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.838
the calf,
and the rest was inside."

00:21:01.838 --> 00:21:07.228
He's representing the Popes who
were here upside down,

00:21:07.228 --> 00:21:12.718
that's the way Simon fell,
and I'll have a little story

00:21:12.718 --> 00:21:14.650
about that too.
 

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.625
It was also the position that,
according to legend,

00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:18.863
St.
 

00:21:18.863 --> 00:21:21.088
Peter wanted for himself.
 

00:21:21.088 --> 00:21:26.340
He asked that he be buried
upside down because he wanted to

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.509
show what the true direction
of--

00:21:29.509 --> 00:21:32.759
for the souls are sent for the
perfection of being--

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:36.230
that idea that--remember in an
inverted world,

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.094
a world which is upside down
and therefore to be with the

00:21:39.094 --> 00:21:42.689
head down,
you are really--are right side

00:21:42.689 --> 00:21:43.078
up.
 

00:21:43.078 --> 00:21:45.618
You're going toward your proper
destination.

00:21:45.618 --> 00:21:50.070
Dante is playing with this
iconographic motif of Peter who

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.972
asks to be crucified up--
with the head upside down and

00:21:53.972 --> 00:21:57.740
the story of Simon who,
very much like him now,

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.470
is as a punishment is with the
head upside down.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.380
How are they punished?
 

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:09.567
In an overt parody of the
Pentecost and the flames of

00:22:09.567 --> 00:22:10.400
fire.
 

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:13.266
You know the story of the
Pentecost: that's the story of

00:22:13.266 --> 00:22:15.402
the Pentecost,
is the story of the gift of

00:22:15.402 --> 00:22:16.078
language.
 

00:22:16.078 --> 00:22:19.170
They come down as a rain of
fire on them,

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:22.028
now they have flames on their
feet.

00:22:22.028 --> 00:22:28.142
This is what--this is the sort
of horrible turning around of

00:22:28.142 --> 00:22:32.390
prophecy and of the gift of
languages,

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:36.160
meaning that we all speak
everybody else's language,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.663
which clearly means--I'm sure
that there are polyglots among

00:22:39.663 --> 00:22:41.592
you,
but it clearly means that we

00:22:41.592 --> 00:22:44.240
all speak one language:
the language of charity.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.029
And therefore we can all
understand each other that way.

00:22:48.029 --> 00:22:53.460
"That they would have
snapped withies or ropes.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.750
As flames on oily things,"
the oil of unction.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.868
So it's a further illusion to
the desecration that is taking

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:04.801
place here,"
moves only over the outer

00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:07.845
surface,
so it did there from the heels

00:23:07.845 --> 00:23:08.700
to the toe.
 

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.019
'Who is that one?'"
Dante asks.

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:14.318
He wants to know who it is,
but he sees.

00:23:14.318 --> 00:23:17.798
"Master that writhes in
his torment more than any of his

00:23:17.798 --> 00:23:20.291
fellows,' I said,
'and is licked by a redder

00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:20.930
flame?'
 

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.413
And he answered me,
'If thou wilt have me carry

00:23:24.413 --> 00:23:27.519
thee down there by that more
sloping bank,

00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:32.140
thou shalt know from himself of
him and of his misdeeds.'

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.630
And I, 'All is well for me that
is thy pleasure.

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.250
Thou art my Lord and knowest
that I depart not from thy will;

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.890
thou knowest too what I do not
speak.'

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.960
Then we came onto the fourth
dike, turned and descended on

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.318
our left down to the pitted and
narrow bottom,

00:23:53.318 --> 00:23:57.941
and the good master did not set
me down from his haunch until he

00:23:57.941 --> 00:24:01.903
brought me to the hole of him
that so lamented with his

00:24:01.903 --> 00:24:02.710
shanks.
 

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:07.559
'Whoever thou art,' I began,
'unhappy soul that art held

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:11.882
upside down planted like a post,
if thou art able,

00:24:11.882 --> 00:24:15.826
speak.'"
Now the series of inversions is

00:24:15.826 --> 00:24:17.119
introduced here.
 

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:20.817
"I," Dante says,
"stood there like the

00:24:20.817 --> 00:24:23.352
friar"--
he is the layman,

00:24:23.352 --> 00:24:28.102
the changing of roles,
and the pope who is going to

00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:31.273
be--unveil his own--
reveal his own identity in a

00:24:31.273 --> 00:24:34.688
moment,
he is there like an assassin,

00:24:34.688 --> 00:24:38.368
a perfidious assassin,
meaning the one who brought

00:24:38.368 --> 00:24:38.680
faith.
 

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.243
That's what the word
"perfidy"

00:24:41.243 --> 00:24:41.769
means.
 

00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:43.759
"That shrives the
treacherous,"

00:24:43.759 --> 00:24:45.650
in Italian it's the
perfido,

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:49.089
"assassin who after being
fixed calls him back so that he

00:24:49.089 --> 00:24:51.288
delays his death,
and he cried."

00:24:51.288 --> 00:24:55.573
This is one of the popes,
Nicholas, who misunderstands,

00:24:55.573 --> 00:24:59.460
but this misunderstanding is
highly suggestive.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:04.347
He's telling Dante and us that
the reigning pope while Dante's

00:25:04.347 --> 00:25:06.534
writing,
Boniface VIII,

00:25:06.534 --> 00:25:10.313
one of the Orsini family,
one of the great families,

00:25:10.313 --> 00:25:13.240
Roman families,
has already arrived and he

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.278
says, "Standest thou there
already Boniface?

00:25:17.278 --> 00:25:20.750
By several years the writing
lied to me.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.549
Art thou so soon sated with
these gains for which thou didst

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:29.411
not fear to take that by guile,
the Lady Beautiful and then to

00:25:29.411 --> 00:25:31.368
do her outrage."
 

00:25:31.368 --> 00:25:38.037
This is the coming--the
accusation that Dante can launch

00:25:38.037 --> 00:25:41.190
at the figures of power.
 

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:47.759
The prophet who takes on power
and unveils its abusers.

00:25:47.759 --> 00:25:50.832
"I became like those that
stand as if mocked,

00:25:50.832 --> 00:25:53.339
not comprehending the reply
made to them,

00:25:53.339 --> 00:25:55.410
and know not what to answer.'
 

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:57.583
Then Virgil said:
'Tell him quickly,

00:25:57.583 --> 00:26:01.183
I'm not he, I'm not he thou
thinkest,' and I answered as if

00:26:01.183 --> 00:26:02.240
I was bidden.
 

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.828
At that the spirit twisted his
feet together,

00:26:04.828 --> 00:26:07.712
then, sighing with lamenting
voice, he said to me,

00:26:07.712 --> 00:26:09.950
'What dost thou want with me
then?

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:13.663
If to know who I am concerns
thee so much that thou hast come

00:26:13.663 --> 00:26:16.758
down the bank for it,
know that I was invested with

00:26:16.758 --> 00:26:18.430
the great mantle."
 

00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:19.259
And so on.
 

00:26:19.259 --> 00:26:23.304
And Dante will go on into a
general attack,

00:26:23.304 --> 00:26:27.058
which is really the prophetic
moment.

00:26:27.058 --> 00:26:30.270
"I do not know,"
I'm reading from lines 90 and

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.220
following,
"I do not know if on that

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:36.944
I was overbold when all my
answer to him was in this

00:26:36.944 --> 00:26:38.926
strain: 'Pray,
tell me now,

00:26:38.926 --> 00:26:41.374
how much treasure did our Lord
require of St.

00:26:41.374 --> 00:26:44.098
Peter before He gave the keys
into his charge?

00:26:44.098 --> 00:26:46.609
Surely he asked nothing but
"Follow me,"

00:26:46.609 --> 00:26:49.222
nor did Peter or the others
take gold or silver from

00:26:49.222 --> 00:26:50.759
Matthias,"
and so on.

00:26:50.759 --> 00:26:54.108
This is Dante now the prophet.
 

00:26:54.108 --> 00:26:59.520
Dante, the man who speaks
because--and he feels that he

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.832
ought to speak and that's the
distance taking from the

00:27:04.832 --> 00:27:11.246
gratuitousness of the accusation
because all figures of authority

00:27:11.246 --> 00:27:13.048
are lacking.
 

00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:16.806
In the presence of this eclipse
of authority,

00:27:16.806 --> 00:27:21.844
he thinks that it is incumbent
upon him to go on taking that

00:27:21.844 --> 00:27:23.039
authority.
 

00:27:23.039 --> 00:27:26.874
It's a usurpation of a voice;
it's a usurpation of authority

00:27:26.874 --> 00:27:30.400
in order to make up for what he
thinks is missing.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.063
The problem,
this whole question about the

00:27:35.063 --> 00:27:40.000
confusion of orders,
the confusion between the

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.593
secular and the sacred,
the profane and the sacred,

00:27:44.593 --> 00:27:49.307
is brought back to one great
event which was known in the

00:27:49.307 --> 00:27:52.759
Middle Ages as the second sin of
Adam.

00:27:52.759 --> 00:27:58.269
It was so great--you understand
what the first sin of Adam was:

00:27:58.269 --> 00:28:03.159
the transgression of the
command given to him not to eat

00:28:03.159 --> 00:28:06.480
of the tree--
of the forbidden tree,

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.200
the forbidden fruit of the
tree.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.909
The event that Dante goes back
to is the event of the so-called

00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:17.803
Donation of Constantine,
about which I want to say a few

00:28:17.803 --> 00:28:20.538
things and then we move onto the
next cantos.

00:28:20.538 --> 00:28:22.588
It's the Donation of
Constantine.

00:28:22.588 --> 00:28:26.530
It refers to the fourth
century, when the emperor

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:30.471
Constantine, whose name I think
I have mentioned,

00:28:30.471 --> 00:28:34.250
gave--extended,
gave the land to the pope.

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:39.473
In other words,
made the pope the ruler of a

00:28:39.473 --> 00:28:41.538
secular domain.
 

00:28:41.538 --> 00:28:47.170
To Dante, this was a confusion
of registers,

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.459
a confusion of
responsibilities,

00:28:49.459 --> 00:28:53.669
that the pope should be only
engaged in spiritual pursuits

00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:55.588
and spiritual matters.
 

00:28:55.588 --> 00:28:58.828
He becomes instead involved in
secular matters.

00:28:58.828 --> 00:29:03.086
The sin of simony is really the
problem between the--has to do

00:29:03.086 --> 00:29:05.528
with the Donation of
Constantine.

00:29:05.528 --> 00:29:08.130
An issue, by the way,
I will tell you why this is

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.430
important in a second.
 

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.585
The issue is--will be really
clarified around the fifteenth

00:29:13.585 --> 00:29:16.164
century when two people,
two figures,

00:29:16.164 --> 00:29:19.390
one is Cusanus,
some of you may know him.

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.943
Nicholas of Cusa went home
repeating the moral arguments

00:29:22.943 --> 00:29:26.240
against the Donation of
Constantine as much as Dante

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.920
does here,
but the one who really proved

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.780
the falseness of the documents
with which Constantine

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:40.670
supposedly made the donation to
the pope was Lorenzo Valla,

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.038
with a philologist who went on
examining the language of that

00:29:44.038 --> 00:29:46.230
text and by examining that
language,

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:49.759
found out that the donation was
not really--

00:29:49.759 --> 00:29:53.535
the document had not possibly
been written in the fourth

00:29:53.535 --> 00:29:57.173
century because it bore the
traces of eleventh-century

00:29:57.173 --> 00:29:57.858
Latin.
 

00:29:57.858 --> 00:30:01.538
And so he went on specifying
that that Donation had been a

00:30:01.538 --> 00:30:05.476
forgery and the forgery had been
committed in a convent in the

00:30:05.476 --> 00:30:08.317
south of France with
extraordinary linguistic

00:30:08.317 --> 00:30:09.349
precision.
 

00:30:09.349 --> 00:30:11.880
Why is this important to Dante?
 

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:15.971
Dante makes this issue of the
Donation of Constantine,

00:30:15.971 --> 00:30:20.061
the confusion of orders,
the spiritual and the secular

00:30:20.061 --> 00:30:25.074
which simony embodies;
simony crystallizes the real

00:30:25.074 --> 00:30:29.259
problem of the crisis of his own
time.

00:30:29.259 --> 00:30:33.511
So huge, I repeat,
that it's called the second sin

00:30:33.511 --> 00:30:34.380
of Adam.
 

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.390
Dante wrote a political text
called Monarchia,

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:43.505
which is really an argument in
favor of the separation between

00:30:43.505 --> 00:30:47.246
these two orders,
the Church and the State:

00:30:47.246 --> 00:30:51.056
it had to be neatly divided,
both to protect the State from

00:30:51.056 --> 00:30:54.623
the intrusions of the Church and
to protect the Church from the

00:30:54.623 --> 00:30:56.578
likely intrusions of the State.
 

00:30:56.578 --> 00:31:00.680
So it's really an argument that
goes in two directions.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.598
So much then for Canto XIX.
 

00:31:03.598 --> 00:31:07.525
The last thing I have to say
because I began talking about

00:31:07.525 --> 00:31:11.657
the rhetoric of the prophets,
I said the prophets really used

00:31:11.657 --> 00:31:12.759
apostrophes.
 

00:31:12.759 --> 00:31:16.087
Apostrophes which are forms of
lament, "Ah,

00:31:16.087 --> 00:31:18.778
Simon,"
you can see it's a kind of

00:31:18.778 --> 00:31:19.700
mourning.
 

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.500
It's the language of grief
primarily,

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.656
but there is also,
from a linguistic point of

00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:28.090
view,
something else about an

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.243
apostrophe,
because an apostrophe--it has

00:31:31.243 --> 00:31:33.809
in indeterminacy of its own.
 

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:35.170
It's not really language.
 

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:36.650
It says nothing.
 

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:40.712
It's a scream,
but it's the sense of a need to

00:31:40.712 --> 00:31:42.519
break the silence.
 

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:46.259
In other words,
you use an apostrophe or emit a

00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:51.218
cry because you cannot be quiet
and that's really exactly what

00:31:51.218 --> 00:31:55.690
makes this aspect of prophetic
language so crucial.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:59.170
It's between silence,
one is overcome by what

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.281
one--the enormity of what one
sees and the refusal to

00:32:03.281 --> 00:32:04.390
acquiesce.
 

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.492
And I could give you--"Ah
Constantine,"

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:10.078
that's another apostrophe that
we saw.

00:32:10.078 --> 00:32:14.258
The whole canto is punctuated
by this rhetorical form that

00:32:14.258 --> 00:32:18.730
wants to break the silence and
cannot quite find the words.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:22.075
That's what I call the
indeterminacy of the rhetorical

00:32:22.075 --> 00:32:22.769
artifice.
 

00:32:22.769 --> 00:32:28.180
Let me just go--I know that I
said that I would read XXI;

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.348
maybe I can talk about it.
 

00:32:29.348 --> 00:32:31.750
I have to say very little about
comedy.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.480
Dante uses the language of
comedy and what I--

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.864
had we time,
I would talk about how Dante

00:32:37.864 --> 00:32:41.009
goes out of the way,
in XXI, and says here,

00:32:41.009 --> 00:32:43.003
"Now my comedy,
the language,

00:32:43.003 --> 00:32:44.470
the humble style."
 

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:50.548
It is as if he wants to free
himself from the shackles,

00:32:50.548 --> 00:32:55.496
the complications of using a
lofty language or taking on this

00:32:55.496 --> 00:33:00.690
extraordinary position of being
the prophet of his own times.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.448
He goes on to say,
"my comedy,"

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:07.585
but this comedy is also link to
a peculiar experience that he

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:10.618
tells in Canto XXI:
the fear of falling.

00:33:10.618 --> 00:33:14.460
The devils are after him
and--the devils,

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:19.259
of course--he calls them Guelfs
and Ghibellines.

00:33:19.259 --> 00:33:22.240
Another way of thinking about
them was the war between,

00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.608
he says, whites and blacks,
bianchi and neri.

00:33:25.608 --> 00:33:28.259
That's the way they would
distinguish themselves.

00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:31.990
These demons are--his enemies
are the blacks,

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:35.868
the Ghibellines who are trying
to throw him down,

00:33:35.868 --> 00:33:39.640
and the point is that comedy is
always attached,

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.328
always flanked with the idea of
the fall.

00:33:43.328 --> 00:33:47.207
Laughter, as it were,
begins at the moment when

00:33:47.207 --> 00:33:50.351
someone falls,
someone slips and so we could

00:33:50.351 --> 00:33:52.890
really talk about that a little
bit more,

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.160
but not much more,
if we had a chance to--

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.558
if we had a little bit more
time.

00:33:56.558 --> 00:34:00.334
I'm anxious to get into XXVI,
and before we get to XXVI,

00:34:00.334 --> 00:34:04.038
there is a passage in Canto XXV
that I have to read.

00:34:04.038 --> 00:34:07.769
Dante's been going through the
realm of the thieves,

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:13.077
Canto XXIV and XXV,
and he is overwhelmed by the

00:34:13.077 --> 00:34:18.161
metamorphosis:
the form of punishment of these

00:34:18.161 --> 00:34:22.340
thieves that go on changing
form.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.268
They become snakes.
 

00:34:24.268 --> 00:34:27.851
They are human beings bitten by
snakes, they become snakes,

00:34:27.851 --> 00:34:30.938
they turn into ashes,
and they recompose themselves

00:34:30.938 --> 00:34:32.420
in an endless cycle.
 

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.289
This is the punishment.
 

00:34:33.289 --> 00:34:38.114
Dante goes on writing as a
poet, breaking the flow of the

00:34:38.114 --> 00:34:41.820
narrative of what has been
happening to him,

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.320
and this is what he says.
 

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:51.150
This is from Canto XXV,
lines 90 and following.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:55.157
He describes the--actually
reading from lines 80 and

00:34:55.157 --> 00:34:57.509
following:
"As the lizard under the

00:34:57.509 --> 00:35:00.963
great scourge of the dogdays,
passing from hedge to hedge,

00:35:00.963 --> 00:35:03.940
seems lightening if it crossed
the way,

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.179
so appeared,
making for the bellies of the

00:35:06.179 --> 00:35:08.762
other two,
a small fiery serpent,

00:35:08.762 --> 00:35:11.570
livid and black as a
peppercorn;

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.838
and that part by which we first
received our nourishment,

00:35:14.838 --> 00:35:17.989
it transfixed in one of them,
then fell down before him

00:35:17.989 --> 00:35:19.039
stretched out.
 

00:35:19.039 --> 00:35:22.420
The one transfixed stared at
it, but said nothing,

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:26.353
only stood still and yawned,
as if sleep or fever had come

00:35:26.353 --> 00:35:27.250
upon him.
 

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.599
He kept looking at the serpent
and it at him;

00:35:30.599 --> 00:35:33.541
the one from the wound,
the other from the mouth,

00:35:33.541 --> 00:35:36.300
smoked violently and their
smoke met."

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.710
Now here is Dante talking as a
poet.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:42.891
He breaks the account,
the chronicle of what he has

00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:45.266
seen,
the witnessing since that's

00:35:45.266 --> 00:35:48.460
what he is,
he's the witness in all these

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:53.202
experiences and that's what he
says: "Let Lucan now be

00:35:53.202 --> 00:35:58.110
silent with his tales of
wretched Sebellus and Nasidius,

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.840
and let him wait to hear what
now comes forth.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.869
Let Ovid be silent about Cadmus
and Arethusa;

00:36:04.869 --> 00:36:09.112
for if in his lines he turns
him into a serpent and her into

00:36:09.112 --> 00:36:11.844
a fountain,
I do not grudge it to him,

00:36:11.844 --> 00:36:15.889
for two natures face to face he
never saw transmuted that both

00:36:15.889 --> 00:36:19.469
kinds were ready to exchange
their substance."

00:36:19.469 --> 00:36:24.355
On the face of it,
Dante's saying that the kind of

00:36:24.355 --> 00:36:30.237
metamorphosis he's describing
really is more horrifying than

00:36:30.237 --> 00:36:33.454
anything that Ovid,
the author of the

00:36:33.454 --> 00:36:36.666
Metamorphosis,
who has always guided his

00:36:36.666 --> 00:36:40.768
metamorphosis by a belief in the
bondage,

00:36:40.768 --> 00:36:44.820
in the bond of--in the
solidarity between humans,

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.940
human beings and the natural
world.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:52.059
We can go on shifting forms and
there is a kind of serene

00:36:52.059 --> 00:36:55.260
transformation happening in
Ovid.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.846
He also says that he's
different from Lucan,

00:36:58.846 --> 00:37:03.768
another author of scenes of
metamorphosis in his story about

00:37:03.768 --> 00:37:05.268
the civil war.
 

00:37:05.268 --> 00:37:09.889
The point that I think is
really crucial here is that it's

00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:11.349
a different one.
 

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:16.793
Dante is repeating and
reenacting exactly the kind of

00:37:16.793 --> 00:37:23.076
aesthetic temptation that we
already witnessed in Canto IV of

00:37:23.076 --> 00:37:27.175
Inferno,
in Limbo, where Dante meets the

00:37:27.175 --> 00:37:30.838
poets and he's so taken,
so complacent about undoubtedly

00:37:30.838 --> 00:37:33.329
the great temptation of sitting
with--

00:37:33.329 --> 00:37:37.090
can you imagine--Homer,
Virgil, Horace,

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.029
Lucan, Ovid,
exactly the people that he

00:37:40.029 --> 00:37:40.880
mentions.
 

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.748
Retrospectively,
that scene of harmony that

00:37:44.748 --> 00:37:50.369
Canto IV seemed to dramatize,
now is completely vanquished.

00:37:50.369 --> 00:37:53.753
Here he is, he's really saying,
I am their rival,

00:37:53.753 --> 00:37:56.856
I am even better,
I'm seeing things that they

00:37:56.856 --> 00:37:58.550
didn't even imagine.
 

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:02.228
If you had the illusion of an
idyllic relationship among

00:38:02.228 --> 00:38:04.969
poets, you are disabused at this
point.

00:38:04.969 --> 00:38:10.541
It is a temptation nonetheless,
because once again Dante is

00:38:10.541 --> 00:38:13.432
going down for--
in a descent,

00:38:13.432 --> 00:38:17.280
which is a descent of spiritual
humility,

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.780
and yet his voice seems to be
going in an opposite direction,

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:24.481
one of hubris,
the same kind of temptation

00:38:24.481 --> 00:38:26.829
that he had in Canto IV.
 

00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:29.516
This is what happens,
again, the structure repeats

00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:30.010
itself.
 

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:33.375
In Canto IV,
Dante claims that he builds

00:38:33.375 --> 00:38:36.309
fellowship with the great poets.
 

00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:40.557
He comes into Canto V and he
has to confront the

00:38:40.557 --> 00:38:45.717
responsibilities of writing,
the responsibilities of being a

00:38:45.717 --> 00:38:48.380
writer and he encounters his
own--

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.909
a reader of his own.
 

00:38:49.909 --> 00:38:55.001
Dante merges into Canto XXVI
and meets none other than

00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:58.516
Ulysses,
the master rhetorician,

00:38:58.516 --> 00:39:04.389
whose experience and whose
journey will lead himself and

00:39:04.389 --> 00:39:08.018
his companions to a tragic end.
 

00:39:08.018 --> 00:39:10.898
For Dante this is an
extraordinary moment for a

00:39:10.898 --> 00:39:12.150
number of reasons.
 

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:18.289
Ulysses is a steady point of
reference for his own adventure.

00:39:18.289 --> 00:39:21.724
He will keep thinking of him in
Canto XIX of Purgatorio

00:39:21.724 --> 00:39:24.090
and in Canto XXVIII of
Paradise,

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:27.659
when Dante is about to live
beyond the whole--

00:39:27.659 --> 00:39:29.170
the physical universe.
 

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:32.380
He looks back to see the
distance he has traveled,

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:36.440
and the only thing that he sees
is really that passageway where

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.800
Ulysses violated all boundaries.
 

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.630
Clearly, what kind of
boundaries am I violating?

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:45.643
Ulysses is a mode of being,
a possibility of being,

00:39:45.643 --> 00:39:47.250
for Dante himself.
 

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:52.215
We come into Canto XXVI and I
would like to take as much time

00:39:52.215 --> 00:39:57.179
as I possibly can without tiring
you all about this canto.

00:39:57.179 --> 00:40:03.132
Let me begin with--as a sort of
preamble--tell you a general

00:40:03.132 --> 00:40:03.940
point.
 

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:10.947
Every school child in antiquity
and in Dante's own time knew one

00:40:10.947 --> 00:40:15.074
thing,
that Ulysses was a famous Greek

00:40:15.074 --> 00:40:18.213
hero,
polytropic as Homer calls him:

00:40:18.213 --> 00:40:21.431
the man of many terms,
a man who knew it all,

00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:24.320
the man who had been seasoned
in all experiences.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.768
They know that he had gone to
the War of Troy,

00:40:27.768 --> 00:40:31.527
that he was the one to suggest
the building of the Trojan horse

00:40:31.527 --> 00:40:33.768
and the stealing of the
Palladium,

00:40:33.768 --> 00:40:36.829
as you know,
the simulacrum of Minerva.

00:40:36.829 --> 00:40:40.559
Wisdom, the figure of--the
image of wisdom and then it took

00:40:40.559 --> 00:40:43.282
him--
that he was involved in the

00:40:43.282 --> 00:40:47.576
battle about inheriting
Achilles' arms with Ajax and

00:40:47.576 --> 00:40:52.458
then everybody knew that it took
him ten years to return to

00:40:52.458 --> 00:40:53.469
Ithaca.
 

00:40:53.469 --> 00:40:55.889
This is the story of the
Odyssey.

00:40:55.889 --> 00:41:00.387
He returns, he goes to--we do
know only that the nostos

00:41:00.387 --> 00:41:03.927
as the Greeks call it,
the return, the journey of

00:41:03.927 --> 00:41:04.739
return.
 

00:41:04.739 --> 00:41:07.945
He becomes the hero of
nostalgia, the going back to a

00:41:07.945 --> 00:41:09.179
place that he has.
 

00:41:09.179 --> 00:41:12.554
Everybody knew this in
Dante--in antiquity and in

00:41:12.554 --> 00:41:13.610
Dante's time.
 

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:17.389
In antiquity they knew it very
well because then the story of

00:41:17.389 --> 00:41:21.295
Ulysses had become an allegory,
a philosophical allegory of the

00:41:21.295 --> 00:41:22.619
fate of the soul.
 

00:41:22.619 --> 00:41:26.181
The idea of Ulysses who goes
from Ithaca to Troy and then

00:41:26.181 --> 00:41:29.489
goes back for ten years after a
war of ten years,

00:41:29.489 --> 00:41:31.478
another ten years of
vicissitudes,

00:41:31.478 --> 00:41:33.829
cleansing himself in order to
reach--

00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:38.351
to go back to and testing
himself to go back to his home

00:41:38.351 --> 00:41:40.882
town,
was really the story of the

00:41:40.882 --> 00:41:41.300
soul.
 

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.500
That's what the soul does.
 

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.641
It incarnates itself,
strophe and

00:41:44.641 --> 00:41:48.588
antistrophe,
it goes through--the soul goes

00:41:48.588 --> 00:41:54.065
through the planets and gets
tainted by the attributes of the

00:41:54.065 --> 00:41:55.070
planets.
 

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:57.789
Some of us are lunatics,
others are mercurial,

00:41:57.789 --> 00:41:59.179
others are saturnine.
 

00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:02.838
That's from the planets,
but then by cleansing ourselves

00:42:02.838 --> 00:42:05.900
the soul can go back to its
place of origin.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.619
That's the circle of the return.
 

00:42:08.619 --> 00:42:12.530
That's the way the Alexandrian
neo-Platonists understood the

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.719
allegory of the Odyssey.
 

00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:16.440
This is clear.
 

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:21.635
Dante violates this rule:
that's what you have in Canto

00:42:21.635 --> 00:42:22.309
XXVI.
 

00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:26.637
Dante begins with Ulysses who
has returned to Ithaca and

00:42:26.637 --> 00:42:30.730
starts his journeys of
exploration all over again.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:35.170
The idea of the eternal return,
the idea of a closure that he

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.204
has come back home,
is not part of Dante's

00:42:38.204 --> 00:42:40.500
imagination or sensibility.
 

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.561
He is the poet who is truly
restless and always placing

00:42:45.561 --> 00:42:50.059
himself and his heroes on some
kind of quest,

00:42:50.059 --> 00:42:54.090
on a method,
on a road, on an address or

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:58.429
whatever the idea,
the philosophers who are always

00:42:58.429 --> 00:43:01.224
on--
always thinking about some way

00:43:01.224 --> 00:43:04.159
of reaching wisdom,
reaching truth.

00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:08.059
That's where he puts them and
that's what happens with the

00:43:08.059 --> 00:43:09.360
story of Ulysses.
 

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:15.409
Ulysses starts all over again
and goes to die.

00:43:15.409 --> 00:43:19.831
He's involved in a journey that
is absolutely gratuitous:

00:43:19.831 --> 00:43:23.780
a journey for wisdom,
a journey for wisdom into the

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:25.360
unpeopled world.
 

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.264
We're going to see this in a
moment, and he dies.

00:43:29.264 --> 00:43:30.239
That's it.
 

00:43:30.239 --> 00:43:33.862
From one point of view--and I
want you to be careful as you

00:43:33.862 --> 00:43:36.300
read the canto because you will
see--

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:40.068
you will notice one thing,
the first thing you will notice

00:43:40.068 --> 00:43:44.170
that it's not Dante who conducts
the interview with Ulysses.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:48.679
It is Virgil,
the poet of Latin antiquity and

00:43:48.679 --> 00:43:54.523
supposedly they speak maybe
Greek or some form of--clearly

00:43:54.523 --> 00:43:55.550
Greek.
 

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.507
It is Virgil,
the poet of the Aeneid

00:43:59.507 --> 00:44:04.690
who thinks of himself as the
fitting interlocutor of the

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.670
great Greek hero.
 

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.360
Not Dante, Dante's excluded.
 

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.759
Dante just watches and
witnesses this,

00:44:11.759 --> 00:44:16.630
but there's more to this idea
of stylistic decorum.

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:21.155
One can say well Virgil--this
is in fact as tragic as a text

00:44:21.155 --> 00:44:23.150
could ever get,
sublime.

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:26.943
This is not a comical text,
this is Virgil the author of a

00:44:26.943 --> 00:44:27.610
tragedy.
 

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.539
That's what Dante calls it,
the tragic style,

00:44:30.539 --> 00:44:33.402
the sublime style,
and Ulysses speaks in the

00:44:33.402 --> 00:44:36.000
most--in the loftiest way
possible.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.637
It's not just a question of
stylistic decorum,

00:44:38.637 --> 00:44:40.690
at stake there is something
else.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:46.498
Ulysses disguises himself as
Aeneas and tells the story of

00:44:46.498 --> 00:44:49.760
his life as if he were Aeneas.
 

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.949
Now, let me just tell you one
little thing and then we'll get

00:44:51.949 --> 00:44:52.570
into the canto.
 

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:56.380
This is part of the story in
many ways.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:01.010
If you ask readers of Virgil
and Homer,

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:04.510
they probably will tell
you--well Virgil is a good poet,

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:07.610
but let's face it the first six
books are just the

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:11.306
Odyssey and the second books
are just the Iliad that

00:45:11.306 --> 00:45:13.869
he sort of gives a resume of and
so on.

00:45:13.869 --> 00:45:16.130
Not at all.
 

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:19.295
The difference between the two
heroes is this:

00:45:19.295 --> 00:45:21.829
Ulysses has a place to go back
to.

00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:26.340
He goes from Ithaca to Troy,
back to Ithaca.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.449
Aeneas has no place to go to.
 

00:45:29.449 --> 00:45:34.242
His is the open quest,
the road, on open-ended road,

00:45:34.242 --> 00:45:40.161
and open-ended journey and this
is the way Ulysses will think of

00:45:40.161 --> 00:45:41.289
himself.
 

00:45:41.289 --> 00:45:44.070
For the last thing,
and then really we'll get into

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:48.047
the canto,
the last thing I'll say is that

00:45:48.047 --> 00:45:53.003
the extraordinary ambiguity--
I want to point out the

00:45:53.003 --> 00:45:57.840
extraordinary ambiguity with
which Dante represents Ulysses.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:02.132
But the ambiguity of Ulysses is
part of the story of Ulysses

00:46:02.132 --> 00:46:03.369
from the start.
 

00:46:03.369 --> 00:46:07.739
From the very beginning,
Ulysses is a philosopher and he

00:46:07.739 --> 00:46:09.250
is a rhetorician.
 

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:13.512
He is someone who can
manipulate all knowledge for his

00:46:13.512 --> 00:46:17.615
own ends, and it is this
ambiguity that in many ways

00:46:17.615 --> 00:46:20.030
Dante finds very alluring.
 

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.199
Let me start with the canto.
 

00:46:22.199 --> 00:46:29.929
The canto starts with another
very topical relation,

00:46:29.929 --> 00:46:33.869
a very topical allusion.
 

00:46:33.869 --> 00:46:37.456
Dante is drawing their
attention to a specific place,

00:46:37.456 --> 00:46:39.250
to the city of Florence.
 

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:43.570
It is as if he wants to moor
himself, anchor himself to

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:48.289
something as concrete as is
immediate with--immediate place,

00:46:48.289 --> 00:46:50.289
his own native place.
 

00:46:50.289 --> 00:46:53.404
And it's an apostrophe to
Florence: "Rejoice

00:46:53.404 --> 00:46:56.130
Florence, since thou art so
great."

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.380
Let me just stop here a moment.
 

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:07.434
Pay attention as you read the
canto, pay attention to one

00:47:07.434 --> 00:47:14.481
stylistic element:
the antithetical use of 'great'

00:47:14.481 --> 00:47:20.380
or 'tall and small' at the same
time.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:25.980
Rhetorically sometimes,
all with the idea that--

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.936
of making us ask and wonder
what is the relationship between

00:47:29.936 --> 00:47:33.090
that which claims to be so large
and so big,

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:34.789
and that which claims to be so
small.

00:47:34.789 --> 00:47:37.818
Ulysses obviously thinks of
himself in terms of loftiness

00:47:37.818 --> 00:47:40.360
and Dante now rhetorically
starts with Florence:

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.010
"so great,"
the satire is obvious,

00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:46.666
"that over land and sea
thou beatest thy wings and

00:47:46.666 --> 00:47:49.849
through Hell thy name is spread
abroad."

00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:52.777
The whole point is that he has
seen some Florentine thieves,

00:47:52.777 --> 00:47:54.960
and named even:
"Among the thieves...

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.340
five such citizens of thine
that shame for them comes."

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:02.887
Once again the prophetic voice
of Dante appears here and you

00:48:02.887 --> 00:48:07.360
will see that this is fairly
important in the narrative.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.150
Second paragraph,
"We set out,

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:14.425
and, on the stairs which the
projecting rocks had made for a

00:48:14.425 --> 00:48:17.559
descent before,
my Leader mounted again and

00:48:17.559 --> 00:48:19.990
drew me up,
and, following the lonely way

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.400
among the rocks and splinters of
the ridge,

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.268
the foot made no speed without
the hand.

00:48:25.268 --> 00:48:30.277
I grieved then and grieve now
anew"--;then,

00:48:30.277 --> 00:48:35.496
when he was a pilgrim,
watching and witnessing the

00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:39.440
stories that he is going to
tell.

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.739
And now, as a writer.
 

00:48:41.739 --> 00:48:45.266
There's a double focus that
Dante's using:

00:48:45.266 --> 00:48:50.170
the focus of the pilgrim and
the focus of the narrator.

00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:54.802
"I grieved then and I
grieve now anew when I turn my

00:48:54.802 --> 00:48:58.855
mind to what I saw,
and more than I am wont I curb

00:48:58.855 --> 00:49:00.510
my powers."
 

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:04.641
And this is going to be at
least the attempt of Dante to

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:09.224
curb his powers as he witnesses
the story of immoderate hunger

00:49:09.224 --> 00:49:12.380
for knowledge of a flight of the
mind.

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:13.690
That's what we have here.
 

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:18.121
The flight of the mind which is
like the flight of Daedalus,

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:22.253
which is like the flight of
Icarus that seems to know no

00:49:22.253 --> 00:49:23.380
boundaries.
 

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:26.833
Ulysses is he who transgresses
all boundaries,

00:49:26.833 --> 00:49:30.440
but doesn't Dante also
transgress boundaries?

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:34.079
He won't say so here,
he wants--it seems that he

00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:38.338
takes Ulysses as an exemplary
figure that would lead him

00:49:38.338 --> 00:49:40.739
to--one to curb his powers.
 

00:49:40.739 --> 00:49:44.963
Let's continue,
"lest they run where

00:49:44.963 --> 00:49:48.659
virtue does not guide
them."

00:49:48.659 --> 00:49:54.719
The language is that of horses,
of course, the horses of the

00:49:54.719 --> 00:49:55.440
soul.
 

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:59.275
And virtue is the ability to
hold the black and the white

00:49:59.275 --> 00:50:02.860
horse of the chariot,
to hold them together

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:08.311
and--that's the allusion that
Dante is using in neo-Platonic

00:50:08.311 --> 00:50:09.420
language.
 

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:12.581
"If favoring star or
something better have granted me

00:50:12.581 --> 00:50:15.300
such boon, I may not grudge it
to myself."

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.913
Now, the first description of
the landscape:

00:50:17.913 --> 00:50:21.126
a somber landscape,
"as many as the fireflies

00:50:21.126 --> 00:50:23.630
which the peasant resting on the
hill--

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:27.668
in the season when he that
lights the world least hides his

00:50:27.668 --> 00:50:29.268
face from us..."
 

00:50:29.268 --> 00:50:32.409
What an extraordinary image,
a periphrasis,

00:50:32.409 --> 00:50:34.639
to talk about the sun,
to describe the night,

00:50:34.639 --> 00:50:38.849
when the sun is hiding,
and you'll see the implications

00:50:38.849 --> 00:50:41.349
of this metaphor--
I hope--in a moment.

00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:43.779
"Sees along the valley
below, in the fields,

00:50:43.779 --> 00:50:46.260
perhaps, where he gathers the
grapes and tills;

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.358
with so many flames the eighth
ditch was all gleaming,

00:50:49.358 --> 00:50:52.574
as I perceived as soon as I
came where the bottom was in

00:50:52.574 --> 00:50:53.159
sight.
 

00:50:53.159 --> 00:50:58.166
And as he that was avenged by
the bears saw the chariot of

00:50:58.166 --> 00:51:03.175
Elijah at his departure when the
horses reared and rose to

00:51:03.175 --> 00:51:05.835
heaven,
who could not follow it with

00:51:05.835 --> 00:51:09.045
his eyes so as to see anything
but the flame alone like a

00:51:09.045 --> 00:51:12.570
little cloud mounting up;
so each flame moves along the

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:15.750
gullet of the ditch,
for none shows the theft and

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.400
every one steals away a
sinner."

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:23.409
Dante's not comparing himself
to Elijah, he's comparing to

00:51:23.409 --> 00:51:25.960
someone who watches Elijah.
 

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.530
Elijah is also engaged in a
flight to--

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:32.779
a flight of the soul,
exactly like Ulysses who is

00:51:32.779 --> 00:51:36.556
going to be represented as--
is the antithesis to Ulysses,

00:51:36.556 --> 00:51:39.869
but Dante is neither like
Elijah and he would like us to

00:51:39.869 --> 00:51:42.579
believe that he's not really
like Ulysses.

00:51:42.579 --> 00:51:47.032
He is like Eliseus,
the one who inherits the mantle

00:51:47.032 --> 00:51:51.485
of prophecy from Elijah,
and the one who witnesses,

00:51:51.485 --> 00:51:52.909
who watches.
 

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:58.344
It's his way of trying to avoid
the extreme of the prophet and

00:51:58.344 --> 00:52:01.909
now, as it turns out,
the rhetorician.

00:52:01.909 --> 00:52:07.380
This is the way the layout here
is between Ulysses and Elijah.

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.411
"I was standing on the
bridge,"

00:52:09.411 --> 00:52:10.530
and then he goes on.
 

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:14.039
He's told that within the
flames are the spirits.

00:52:14.039 --> 00:52:17.972
There's a forked flame and
there are two souls:

00:52:17.972 --> 00:52:19.940
Ulysses and Diomedes.
 

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:22.920
Pay attention to this little
detail.

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:28.155
Except in the case of the
suicides, Dante always sees

00:52:28.155 --> 00:52:30.070
pairs of sinners.
 

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:39.199
Here's Diomedes who doesn't
talk and he sees also Ulysses,

00:52:39.199 --> 00:52:44.577
and I suppose that the reason
is that Dante really wants us to

00:52:44.577 --> 00:52:49.340
know about the social quality of
a moral violation,

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:53.760
that a moral violation always
implies somebody else.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.697
It's not quite ever--except for
the suicide which has a peculiar

00:52:57.697 --> 00:53:02.474
form because you have witness,
homicide, and victim all in

00:53:02.474 --> 00:53:08.202
one--but in the other sinners
you always have a sense of a

00:53:08.202 --> 00:53:11.655
witness,
somebody else who has been

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:15.110
touched or an accomplice of the
sinner.

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:18.655
"Within,"
we know what he answered who

00:53:18.655 --> 00:53:20.090
are these people.
 

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:23.672
"I already wished to ask
thee who is in that fire which

00:53:23.672 --> 00:53:27.496
comes so cloven at the top that
seems to rise from the pyre with

00:53:27.496 --> 00:53:30.230
Eteocles was laid with his
brother."

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:31.929
The story is the
Thebaid,

00:53:31.929 --> 00:53:35.739
the two brothers were enemies,
Eteocles and Polyneices,

00:53:35.739 --> 00:53:39.489
Thebes--we already have an
introduction of--

00:53:39.489 --> 00:53:42.320
this is all about Greek
mythology.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.960
In Greek mythology with
brothers--the city of--

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:50.190
the story of Thebes which Dante
knows through Statius,

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:54.320
the idea of Oedipus,
of course and Jocasta,

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.739
and the tragic city.
 

00:53:55.739 --> 00:54:02.590
The Thebes becomes the term,
becomes the metaphor,

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:11.101
the basic metaphor of the
tragic city because in effect it

00:54:11.101 --> 00:54:15.489
presents also--
one of the reasons for Dante

00:54:15.489 --> 00:54:19.003
it's crucial,
it presents birth,

00:54:19.003 --> 00:54:26.990
Eteocles and Polyneices,
the children of Oedipus and

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:30.900
Jocasta,
as tragic events.

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:35.302
This is something that
distinguishes radically the

00:54:35.302 --> 00:54:39.052
Greek idea,
as Dante understands it,

00:54:39.052 --> 00:54:43.829
the Greek idea of cities and
birth from say,

00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:48.197
Virgil's idea of birth,
something to be celebrated all

00:54:48.197 --> 00:54:52.730
the time and Virgil is always
the one who celebrates the

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:55.449
birth-- Assinius Pollio,
etc.

00:54:55.449 --> 00:54:56.840
Now we know who these are.
 

00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:00.090
"He answered me:
'Within there are tormented,

00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:04.190
Ulysses and Diomed,
and thus together they go under

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:07.224
vengeance as once under
wrath..."

00:55:07.224 --> 00:55:07.880
etc.
 

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:12.190
"'If they're able to speak
within these lights,' I said,

00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:15.432
'I earnestly pray thee,
Master, and pray again that my

00:55:15.432 --> 00:55:19.164
prayer avail a thousandfold that
thou do not forbid me to stay

00:55:19.164 --> 00:55:21.429
tils the horned flame comes
near;

00:55:21.429 --> 00:55:23.340
thou seest how I bend toward it
with desire.'

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:26.023
And he said to me,
'Thy prayer deserves much

00:55:26.023 --> 00:55:28.268
praise, therefore I consent to
it.

00:55:28.268 --> 00:55:30.860
But do thou restrain thy
tongue.'"

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:35.329
Earlier he wanted to curb his
powers,

00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:39.269
now Virgil asks him to restrain
his tongue,

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:42.840
"Leave it to me to speak,
for I have understood what thou

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.965
wishest;
for perhaps,

00:55:43.965 --> 00:55:46.690
since they were Greeks,
they would disdain thy

00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:47.659
speech."
 

00:55:47.659 --> 00:55:51.514
We have really a sense of the
hierarchy of styles:

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:55.211
Virgil and Ulysses,
and then in Canto XXVII it's

00:55:55.211 --> 00:55:58.909
going to be Guido da Montefeltro
and Dante.

00:55:58.909 --> 00:56:02.768
"You who are two within
one fire,

00:56:02.768 --> 00:56:04.340
if I deserved of you while I
lived,

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.724
if I deserved of you much or
little,"

00:56:06.724 --> 00:56:09.521
once again,
the oscillation between high

00:56:09.521 --> 00:56:11.228
and low,
"much or little,

00:56:11.228 --> 00:56:13.320
when in the world I wrote the
lofty lines,

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.168
do not move on,
but let the one of you tell

00:56:16.168 --> 00:56:18.349
where,
being lost, he went to die.'

00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:24.320
The greater horn of the ancient
flame began to toss and murmur,

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.518
just as if it were beaten by
the wind,

00:56:27.518 --> 00:56:30.224
then, waving the point to and
fro as if it were the tongue

00:56:30.224 --> 00:56:32.753
that spoke,
it flung forth a voice and

00:56:32.753 --> 00:56:37.706
said: 'When I parted from Circe,
who held me more than a year

00:56:37.706 --> 00:56:41.480
near Gaeta before Aeneas so
named it,"

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:46.692
so you see clearly Ulysses
tells his story through the myth

00:56:46.692 --> 00:56:48.039
of Aeneas.
 

00:56:48.039 --> 00:56:52.275
Claiming priority over Aeneas,
but also the knowledge in one

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:52.849
thing.
 

00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:57.927
It's an incredibly--I find it a
very moving line that Aeneas

00:56:57.927 --> 00:57:01.199
names places in memory of his
nurse.

00:57:01.199 --> 00:57:05.333
He names the city of Gaeta,
he's a founder of cities,

00:57:05.333 --> 00:57:07.719
and names the city of Gaeta.
 

00:57:07.719 --> 00:57:11.193
"Not fondness for his son,
not duty to an aged father,

00:57:11.193 --> 00:57:13.530
not the love I owed
Penelope..."

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:16.623
Look at this,
it's what we call heavily

00:57:16.623 --> 00:57:18.170
ethical language.
 

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:23.650
Ulysses speaks in terms of what
his duties are:

00:57:23.650 --> 00:57:28.179
the duty to an aged father
Laertes,

00:57:28.179 --> 00:57:32.067
"the love I owed Penelope,
which should have gladdened

00:57:32.067 --> 00:57:35.594
her, could conquer within me the
passion I had to gain experience

00:57:35.594 --> 00:57:38.900
of the world and of the vices
and the worth of men."

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:43.438
This is--seems to be an ethical
quest and nothing can stand in

00:57:43.438 --> 00:57:45.969
the way of this virtuous action.
 

00:57:45.969 --> 00:57:51.813
Ulysses thinks of himself as a
virtuous quester after vices,

00:57:51.813 --> 00:57:56.172
understanding and gaining
experience "..

00:57:56.172 --> 00:58:00.829
.of vices and virtues and the
worth of men;

00:58:00.829 --> 00:58:03.869
and I put forth on the open
deep with but one ship...

00:58:03.869 --> 00:58:06.960
The one shore and the other I
saw as far as Spain...

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.860
Morocco...
 

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:08.969
Sardinia..."
 

00:58:08.969 --> 00:58:13.242
And he's a man of--mentions
places all the time,

00:58:13.242 --> 00:58:15.059
in this narrative.
 

00:58:15.059 --> 00:58:18.753
He always mentions places,
cities, Morocco,

00:58:18.753 --> 00:58:23.679
Seville, Ceuta on the other
side of the Mediterranean.

00:58:23.679 --> 00:58:29.610
It is as if here is a man who
lives in space.

00:58:29.610 --> 00:58:31.960
He left his father,
he left his son,

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.713
that would be temporal
description of him,

00:58:34.713 --> 00:58:36.460
but he lives in space.
 

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:41.820
It's as if he never really knew
his own place in the world.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:45.722
He's always looking for
something, he doesn't even--he

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:48.079
doesn't know where he belongs.
 

00:58:48.079 --> 00:58:51.860
"My companions were old
and slow when we came to that

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:55.838
narrow outlet where Hercules set
up his landmarks so that men

00:58:55.838 --> 00:58:57.630
should not pass beyond.
 

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.606
On my right hand I left
Seville, on the other had

00:59:00.606 --> 00:59:02.280
already left Ceuta."
 

00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:05.780
And now the speech he makes to
his own companions.

00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:09.889
Look at the rhetorical wisdom
with which he moves.

00:59:09.889 --> 00:59:13.697
He addresses them as brothers
which is the biggest captatio

00:59:13.697 --> 00:59:16.320
benevolentiae:
we are all together,

00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:18.789
there is no hierarchy here,
I'm not your leader,

00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:21.849
I'm not your king:
"O brothers,' I said,

00:59:21.849 --> 00:59:24.329
'who through a hundred thousand
perils,"

00:59:24.329 --> 00:59:25.739
look at the hyperboles.
 

00:59:25.739 --> 00:59:30.099
If you want to seduce people to
come,

00:59:30.099 --> 00:59:32.849
companions to come with you,
you have to tell them they--

00:59:32.849 --> 00:59:35.389
that theirs are mighty actions
and he does,

00:59:35.389 --> 00:59:39.090
and then magnify all the
possible dangers.

00:59:39.090 --> 00:59:41.577
"A hundred thousand perils
have reached the west,"

00:59:41.577 --> 00:59:45.530
not a definite place,
the west, vague and yet lofty,

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:50.429
"to this so brief vigil of
the senses."

00:59:50.429 --> 00:59:54.346
The modesty,
the oscillation between

00:59:54.346 --> 01:00:00.164
hyperbole and litotes,
as it were, the recoiling into

01:00:00.164 --> 01:00:04.639
the sense of ordinariness and
small.

01:00:04.639 --> 01:00:06.887
"That remains to us,
choose not to deny

01:00:06.887 --> 01:00:09.875
experience,"
which I find an extraordinary

01:00:09.875 --> 01:00:11.518
word,
an experience,

01:00:11.518 --> 01:00:14.619
and I probably will stop here
with this.

01:00:14.619 --> 01:00:17.842
Experience, as you know,
is a word only with

01:00:17.842 --> 01:00:20.239
prepositions,
experire.

01:00:20.239 --> 01:00:23.998
It's a journey,
it's a going through,

01:00:23.998 --> 01:00:25.670
an experience.
 

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:29.860
It's understood as a journey,
it is as if knowledge--that's

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:33.690
the etymology of the word is,
it's a going through.

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:38.885
If knowledge literally is
compared to a displacement

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:44.085
through a traveling,
through a katabasis even,

01:00:44.085 --> 01:00:48.518
in this case,
which is the term to indicate

01:00:48.518 --> 01:00:51.239
the descent into the beyond.
 

01:00:51.239 --> 01:00:54.550
"In the sun's tracks of
the unpeopled world.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.760
Take thought of the seed from
which you spread."

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.552
If you want to know the end of
things you have to know the

01:01:03.552 --> 01:01:07.719
beginnings, you have to know the
seeds.

01:01:07.719 --> 01:01:13.012
This is the--his is Ulysses'
perception and because you have

01:01:13.012 --> 01:01:17.139
a noble seed then you do know
that you are--

01:01:17.139 --> 01:01:21.878
there's a kind of natural
determination in his own mind

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:25.409
that he will reach,
indeed, the noble end.

01:01:25.409 --> 01:01:28.724
"You were not born to live
as brutes, but to follow virtue

01:01:28.724 --> 01:01:29.900
and knowledge."
 

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.730
That's an extraordinary line.
 

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:37.239
He promises that human beings
will leave behind--

01:01:37.239 --> 01:01:40.449
the allusion maybe to the
metamorphosis of Circe,

01:01:40.449 --> 01:01:43.909
that had changed the companions
into pigs,

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:47.202
the Epicureans,
the hogs of Epicurus into the

01:01:47.202 --> 01:01:51.635
voluptuary experiences--
and he promises to restore in

01:01:51.635 --> 01:01:56.525
them not only the human image
but to bring them to virtue,

01:01:56.525 --> 01:01:57.639
knowledge.
 

01:01:57.639 --> 01:02:00.920
It's an extraordinary promise;
it's a very difficult promise.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.360
It's almost an impossible
promise;

01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.800
it may even not be a correct
promise, because he's making a

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.480
promise that virtue is
knowledge.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:14.472
I lead you to virtue and
knowledge, and they may not be

01:02:14.472 --> 01:02:15.730
the same thing.
 

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:18.768
I may have knowledge,
but it doesn't mean that I have

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:21.690
the virtue that I claim to have
knowledge about.

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:25.530
It could be anything,
anything at all.

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:27.510
I can know what prudence is.
 

01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.329
It doesn't--that doesn't really
make me prudent.

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:33.648
Let's stop here,
I want to stop here and I want

01:02:33.648 --> 01:02:38.717
to see if there are some
questions and then resume next

01:02:38.717 --> 01:02:40.969
time with the canto.
 

01:02:40.969 --> 01:02:42.429
Yes?
 

01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:44.213
Student: 
&gt;

01:02:44.213 --> 01:02:46.608
with Aeneas--with Ulysses
because they both aren't going

01:02:46.608 --> 01:02:47.739
to any definite place.
 

01:02:47.739 --> 01:02:49.559
Is that what you said?
 

01:02:49.559 --> 01:02:53.606
Aeneas is like Ulysses because
they both don't have a definite

01:02:53.606 --> 01:02:55.000
place to return to?
 

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.025
Prof: The question is,
I mentioned--actually Ulysses

01:02:58.025 --> 01:03:01.280
mentions knowing that he speaks
to Virgil,

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.739
mentions Aeneas and so that's
the answer,

01:03:05.739 --> 01:03:08.409
why Aeneas and Ulysses vaguely.
 

01:03:08.409 --> 01:03:12.125
That's the--they clearly were
fighting the same battle in

01:03:12.125 --> 01:03:12.590
Troy.
 

01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:18.677
Virgil--Ulysses must know that
Aeneas had lost his home town

01:03:18.677 --> 01:03:22.728
and he took his son,
unlike Ulysses,

01:03:22.728 --> 01:03:27.539
he took his father on his back
literally,

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:32.400
he's an immigrant and his son
and lost his wife Creusa,

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.692
and goes looking for a place
without really knowing what

01:03:35.692 --> 01:03:36.650
place for him.
 

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:39.679
Ulysses knows where he wants to
go;

01:03:39.679 --> 01:03:43.480
he has a certain idea of his
destination, which is Ithaca.

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.867
He has a lot of temptations
along the way:

01:03:45.867 --> 01:03:47.849
Nausicaa, and what a
temptation;

01:03:47.849 --> 01:03:50.809
Circe, another great temptation.
 

01:03:50.809 --> 01:03:55.954
He manages to move beyond those
temptations in order to go back

01:03:55.954 --> 01:03:56.949
to Ithaca.
 

01:03:56.949 --> 01:04:01.710
That's the great difference
from the Roman myth of the

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:02.789
immigrant.
 

01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:05.610
Student:  But in this
version aren't they still really

01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:07.349
different because Ulysses
doesn't--

01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:10.610
I mean he--his quest doesn't
have any direction at all,

01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:14.518
it's just experience,
and Aeneas' quest,

01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:15.847
he doesn't know where he's
going but there's still an

01:04:15.847 --> 01:04:16.842
overall plan so that there is a
definite

01:04:16.842 --> 01:04:17.610
&gt;.
 

01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:21.860
Prof: Exactly,
absolutely, so there is a--the

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:26.775
difference between them becomes
that Aeneas will stop at one

01:04:26.775 --> 01:04:27.610
point.
 

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:30.710
He has temptations to stop in
Sicily,

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:34.289
you remember that there are
famous games,

01:04:34.289 --> 01:04:38.539
the games--ritual games in
memory of his father who had

01:04:38.539 --> 01:04:41.420
died,
the death that hallows that

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.989
ground,
the death of Anchises,

01:04:44.989 --> 01:04:52.150
the women burn the ships--
this is too--this is utopia.

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:54.842
I don't--we don't want to go
around into this epic adventure,

01:04:54.842 --> 01:04:56.099
let's stop here,
he won't.

01:04:56.099 --> 01:04:58.659
He's always misunderstanding
oracles.

01:04:58.659 --> 01:04:59.980
He doesn't know where to go.
 

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:03.755
He's always looking backwards,
but looking forward at the same

01:05:03.755 --> 01:05:05.860
time, but at one point he stops.
 

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.106
And that's part of,
if you wish,

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:11.619
the realism of Aeneas.
 

01:05:11.619 --> 01:05:16.150
He stops at one point;
he will not go any further.

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:20.271
Ulysses goes back home and then
he starts all over again,

01:05:20.271 --> 01:05:23.070
but that's Dante reading of
Ulysses.

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:31.219
He's really reading him as very
much like, as if he were a

01:05:31.219 --> 01:05:35.510
variant of Dante by the way.
 

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:36.789
Yes?
 

01:05:36.789 --> 01:05:39.987
Student:  Is it possible
for Ulysses and Aeneas to

01:05:39.987 --> 01:05:43.356
represent the dichotomy between
Dante the poet and Dante the

01:05:43.356 --> 01:05:44.099
narrator?
 

01:05:44.099 --> 01:05:46.818
One has a definite place as
looking back and has a definite

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:49.539
place where he's going and the
other is taking a journey of

01:05:49.539 --> 01:05:51.789
experience and is not sure where
he's going?

01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:55.130
Prof: The question is
very interesting and is it

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:58.594
possible to think of Aeneas and
Ulysses as two functions,

01:05:58.594 --> 01:06:01.750
as it were, of Dante:
the pilgrim and the poet.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.989
Yes and no.
 

01:06:03.989 --> 01:06:08.985
It's a very interesting
question, but I would not--I

01:06:08.985 --> 01:06:13.980
really hesitate to agree with
you for one reason.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:21.608
Because writing,
for Dante, is a prolongation of

01:06:21.608 --> 01:06:23.719
the search.
 

01:06:23.719 --> 01:06:27.650
Dante literally cannot stop.
 

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:31.456
It's not that he--on the face
of it, he has seen the beatific

01:06:31.456 --> 01:06:34.059
vision, right,
that's really the story.

01:06:34.059 --> 01:06:36.309
A story of a man who goes from
the wilderness,

01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:38.989
goes through Hell,
Purgatory, Paradise,

01:06:38.989 --> 01:06:42.327
and has a beatific vision and
now he starts telling us about

01:06:42.327 --> 01:06:42.610
it.
 

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:46.590
Fighting against forgetfulness,
he has a lot of--

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:50.664
as a writer,
he has a lot of temptations and

01:06:50.664 --> 01:06:55.023
yet the writing itself is
fraught with dangers,

01:06:55.023 --> 01:06:56.539
temptations.
 

01:06:56.539 --> 01:07:00.706
It's a different sort of
journey, but it's the journey of

01:07:00.706 --> 01:07:05.246
writing and therefore there's no
clear-cut distinction between

01:07:05.246 --> 01:07:06.139
the two.
 

01:07:06.139 --> 01:07:11.402
In fact, I just read in Canto
XXV the little scene when he

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:15.389
challenges Lucan and Ovid,
which really is,

01:07:15.389 --> 01:07:18.340
let the past yield to the
present,

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:21.559
that's really the kind of claim
that they can make.

01:07:21.559 --> 01:07:24.893
Let them be quiet,
because I know what is

01:07:24.893 --> 01:07:29.980
happening and the story is that
as a writer he is lapsing,

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.739
he is falling into a number of
temptations,

01:07:32.739 --> 01:07:33.659
as if he were a pilgrim.
 

01:07:33.659 --> 01:07:39.376
You can expect that from a
pilgrim, to being fascinated by

01:07:39.376 --> 01:07:43.989
Francesca, having all these
inner divisions.

01:07:43.989 --> 01:07:48.869
Dante is a deeply divided man,
he has to condemn and at the

01:07:48.869 --> 01:07:52.909
same time has to sympathize even
as a pilgrim.

01:07:52.909 --> 01:07:57.483
So that's really the--that's
the only little detail where I

01:07:57.483 --> 01:08:01.268
would not agree with you,
but maybe you're right,

01:08:01.268 --> 01:08:02.610
I don't know.
 

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:04.650
Yes?
 

01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:06.818
Student:  Can you speak
about the fact that Dante

01:08:06.818 --> 01:08:08.275
changes the ending because his
story's

01:08:08.275 --> 01:08:09.420
&gt;
 

01:08:09.420 --> 01:08:12.869
in Ithaca and why he
&gt;.

01:08:12.869 --> 01:08:16.588
Prof: The question is,
can I speak about how Dante

01:08:16.588 --> 01:08:19.180
changes the ending of Ulysses'
story?

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:20.710
The answer is this.
 

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:27.578
Dante makes Ulysses go back to
Ithaca, but then he breaks the

01:08:27.578 --> 01:08:33.648
circle of this closed
circle--let's call it the circle

01:08:33.648 --> 01:08:35.479
of the epic.
 

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:36.920
Let me talk formally about it.
 

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.569
The idea is that you--what are
some traits of the epic?

01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:45.792
The epics deal with foundations
of cities and destruction of

01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:49.298
cities, all the time,
no matter what that city may

01:08:49.298 --> 01:08:49.800
be.
 

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:53.569
So he has destroyed the city,
goes back to his old city to

01:08:53.569 --> 01:08:54.430
cleanse it.
 

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:58.448
That's--which is Homer's way of
saying--

01:08:58.448 --> 01:09:03.286
I think--you Greeks were so
great when you went out into the

01:09:03.286 --> 01:09:06.479
world at Troy,
let us see how that heroic

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:10.359
ethos is going to help you now
that you are back home,

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:14.164
where probably you are going to
need more courage and more

01:09:14.164 --> 01:09:16.537
determination--
as much courage,

01:09:16.537 --> 01:09:21.104
at least as much determination
as you did have in that great

01:09:21.104 --> 01:09:25.595
celebration of the newly found
Greek unity in Asia Minor in

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:26.368
Troy.
 

01:09:26.368 --> 01:09:32.212
That's--Dante takes that and he
says, there's no closure here,

01:09:32.212 --> 01:09:35.948
because he rejects the idea of
Dante.

01:09:35.948 --> 01:09:40.288
To the epic he replaces the
epic with the novel.

01:09:40.288 --> 01:09:44.155
This becomes a kind of
novelistic story,

01:09:44.155 --> 01:09:49.510
wherein experience is being
arrived at, as one goes.

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:50.600
You see what I'm saying?
 

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:56.194
In the epic you have a kind
of--indeed things return to the

01:09:56.194 --> 01:10:00.729
point of departure,
so that's the difference.

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:04.755
It's a difference between two
radically different ways of

01:10:04.755 --> 01:10:07.630
understanding experience and the
self.

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:12.591
Dante will put himself on the
open road, but Ulysses will

01:10:12.591 --> 01:10:15.960
remain the constant reminder to
him.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.560
He's a phantasm,
he can never quite exorcise.

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:24.027
It will return to him,
as I said, when a siren appears

01:10:24.027 --> 01:10:27.988
and tempts the pilgrim and says
look I made--

01:10:27.988 --> 01:10:32.819
I gave happiness to Ulysses,
why don't you stay with me?

01:10:32.819 --> 01:10:34.238
And the implication is,
first of all,

01:10:34.238 --> 01:10:39.885
she's lying because this is the
story of Ulysses putting the wax

01:10:39.885 --> 01:10:42.663
in his ears,
which is nicely omitted,

01:10:42.663 --> 01:10:46.130
but it's in a way a temptation
to Dante to feel that he,

01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:49.090
too, is an epic hero like
Ulysses.

01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:52.300
Did I answer?
 

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.300
Other questions?
 

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.859
We'll come back to this canto
which is--

01:10:57.859 --> 01:11:04.201
truly plays a crucial role in
Dante's imagination and in

01:11:04.201 --> 01:11:08.887
the Divine Comedy,
the unfolding of the Divine

01:11:08.887 --> 01:11:11.164
Comedy,
so read carefully and then

01:11:11.164 --> 01:11:13.189
we'll go onto the other cantos.
 

01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:14.229
Thank you.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.626
Professor Robert
Shiller: This is the second

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:08.680
of two lectures from Lawrence
Summers.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.918
Let me just say,
again, this is the Okun Lecture

00:00:11.918 --> 00:00:16.260
Series created by an anonymous
donor in honor of Arthur Okun.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.847
At the last lecture,
I was very pleased to hear the

00:00:19.847 --> 00:00:23.794
number of fond memories that
Larry Summers has of Arthur

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:26.222
Okun.
At today's lecture,

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:31.755
I think some people felt that
we didn't have enough time for

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:36.351
question and answer,
so we plan to allocate a half

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:39.400
hour to that.
Does that sound good?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.534
Larry will wrap up just before
the hour and we'll have a good

00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:48.080
discussion.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.725
Professor Larry Summers:
Judging by the discussions I had

00:01:05.725 --> 00:01:09.030
an opportunity to have at lunch
and dinner,

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.774
I would suggest a proposal for
you, Bob, with respect to next

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:20.404
year's Okun lecturer.
Invite the Okun lecturer to

00:01:20.404 --> 00:01:24.267
give his first lecture,
then let him have dinner and

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:27.599
let him have lunch with the Yale
faculty;

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:33.224
then, let him ponder what he's
been told for three weeks and

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:38.753
invite him to come back and
encourage him to emphasize what

00:01:38.753 --> 00:01:43.709
he was told rather than any
ideas he might have.

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.683
You would get substantially
better Okun lectures,

00:01:48.683 --> 00:01:54.589
I suspect, as a consequence,
if the feedback that I got is

00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:58.795
any guide.
I want to thank everybody for

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:04.305
their hospitality and having
seen a certain number of these

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:07.819
kinds of lecture series over
time.

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.539
When I was President of
Harvard, my deepest nightmare,

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.276
one of my deepest
nightmares--some of my

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:17.856
nightmares actually came
true--but some of my lesser

00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:21.575
nightmares as President of
Harvard were the sequential

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:27.651
lecture series,
where at the third lecture no

00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:30.323
one came.
As a lecturer,

00:02:30.323 --> 00:02:35.260
I was concerned the judgment of
those who had seen the product

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.360
is of more interest than the
judgment of those who have not.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.208
So, the fact that the room
looks a little bit like the room

00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:48.551
looked yesterday,
I take as at least mild

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:52.229
encouragement and validation to
proceed.

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:59.090
Yesterday, I talked about two
types of recessions.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.375
What I referred to as
disinflation recessions,

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:07.280
in which the Fed stepped on the
brakes,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.062
the economy slowed,
the Feds stepped off the

00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:14.229
brakes, the economy
reaccelerated.

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:19.807
And, what was my larger focus,
financial system breakdown

00:03:19.807 --> 00:03:24.289
recessions, in which in one way
or another,

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:31.798
bubbles burst or banks face
liquidity problems or the supply

00:03:31.798 --> 00:03:37.780
of finance dried up and the
economy suffered.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.261
I suggested that the latter
category of recession was the

00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:51.145
historical pattern of recession.
That there were some signs that

00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:59.963
the more relevant problem for
the United States going forward

00:03:59.963 --> 00:04:07.900
might well be the latter kind of
recession as well.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.787
I implied a thought I will
develop in the course of these

00:04:13.787 --> 00:04:19.780
remarks--that the incipient
recession in the United States

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.247
is almost certainly of the
latter financial breakdown

00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:30.610
variety rather than the
disinflation variety.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:38.163
We have had instructive,
for me, conversations at both

00:04:38.163 --> 00:04:46.857
dinner and lunch on the question
of how one thinks about these

00:04:46.857 --> 00:04:55.550
two categories of recession in
the context of an ISLM model or

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:04.244
in the context of a simple--some
kind of simple--macroeconomic

00:05:04.244 --> 00:05:08.442
model.
The correct answer to that

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:12.594
question, I think,
is that it's pretty unambiguous

00:05:12.594 --> 00:05:17.848
that a disinflation recession is
best thought of as the Federal

00:05:17.848 --> 00:05:23.652
Reserve tightening money,
which represents some kind of

00:05:23.652 --> 00:05:30.178
leftward movement of the LM
curve--that output declines and

00:05:30.178 --> 00:05:36.816
interest rates rise and that
that's the proximate shock that

00:05:36.816 --> 00:05:43.965
is bringing about the recession.
That it turns out to be a

00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:49.815
matter of semantic
ambiguity--how to think about a

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:56.024
financial crisis recession in
the context of a simple

00:05:56.024 --> 00:06:01.431
macroeconomic model.
Everybody agrees on the

00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:06.590
movement of three variables in
such a recession.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:13.019
Output goes down;
q goes down;

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:19.129
and short-term interest rates
go down.

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.238
One instinct,
which is probably not the first

00:06:23.238 --> 00:06:26.600
instinct in the City of New
Haven,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.938
is to think of that recession
in a traditional ISLM curve,

00:06:31.938 --> 00:06:37.370
with the IS curve and the LM
curve being plotted in a space

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.146
determined by the level of
output and the short term

00:06:42.146 --> 00:06:46.590
interest rate.
In that formulation,

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:53.250
it is clearly an IS shock.
The level of output declines;

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.500
the level of interest rates
decline as well.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:06.062
An alternative formulation and
a formulation that is probably

00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:11.968
more in the spirit of Yale
economics is to think of the

00:07:11.968 --> 00:07:18.421
ISLM diagram as having been
drawn in a space that focuses on

00:07:18.421 --> 00:07:25.093
output and the required return
to capital or focuses on output

00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:29.574
and q.
In a formulation of that kind,

00:07:29.574 --> 00:07:33.360
there hasn't been a shock to
the relationship between

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.199
investment and the price of
capital.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.621
There's been a shock to the
price of capital at any given

00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:43.779
level of the short-term interest
rate.

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:49.453
And so, one thinks of it as
part of the dynamics of the LM

00:07:49.453 --> 00:07:53.856
curve.
However one views that question

00:07:53.856 --> 00:08:00.954
of the IS curve versus the LM
curve, the operative distinction

00:08:00.954 --> 00:08:08.750
between the two kinds of shocks
is that in a disinflation shock,

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.829
interest rates are up and that
is why output is down.

00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:20.423
In a financial breakdown shock,
output is down and that is why

00:08:20.423 --> 00:08:26.800
policy interest rates or safe
interest rates are reduced.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.276
From that perspective,
it's very clear what the

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:35.672
current episode is.
As expectations of future

00:08:35.672 --> 00:08:40.659
output have declined,
as asset prices have declined,

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:48.785
one is seeing very substantial
declines in Treasury bond yields

00:08:48.785 --> 00:08:55.352
and in the Federal Funds Rate.
For those who are aficionados

00:08:55.352 --> 00:08:58.624
of such things,
I will mention that for a

00:08:58.624 --> 00:09:02.975
period of a week,
the five-year TIPS yield was

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:08.018
significantly--it was
negative--at one point reaching

00:09:08.018 --> 00:09:11.509
negative twenty-two basis
points.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:17.294
There was a brief three-hour
period in Japan when the

00:09:17.294 --> 00:09:23.970
one-month Treasury Bill was
yielding not two basis points,

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:29.947
not one basis point,
but literally zero basis points

00:09:29.947 --> 00:09:36.862
as a consequence of various
machinations in the money market

00:09:36.862 --> 00:09:43.659
that had the character of an
extreme flight to safety.

00:09:43.659 --> 00:09:49.057
If one thinks about the
duration and the policy response

00:09:49.057 --> 00:09:53.963
to recessions of these two
kinds, they are usefully

00:09:53.963 --> 00:09:58.242
distinguished.
The policy response and the

00:09:58.242 --> 00:10:03.174
dynamics of disinflation
recessions are not profoundly

00:10:03.174 --> 00:10:06.370
complicated.
The Fed steps on the brakes;

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.223
depending on how hard the Fed
steps on the brakes,

00:10:10.223 --> 00:10:13.370
the recession's duration is
uncertain.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.759
At a certain point,
when it is satisfied that

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:20.997
sufficient disinflation has
taken place or when it feels

00:10:20.997 --> 00:10:24.309
that other imperatives take
precedence,

00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:27.924
the Fed removes its foot from
the brakes, allows short-term

00:10:27.924 --> 00:10:32.515
interest rates to decline,
and eventually the economy

00:10:32.515 --> 00:10:35.202
expands.
There's no great mystery about

00:10:35.202 --> 00:10:37.535
it.
The length and depth of the

00:10:37.535 --> 00:10:41.279
recession is closely tied to the
strength, force,

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:45.179
and length of the Fed
tightening and the speed with

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:48.414
which it eases.
Hence, there was much more

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:51.698
disinflation to be done in
1980-82 and the recession

00:10:51.698 --> 00:10:54.659
interest rates were pushed up
much further;

00:10:54.659 --> 00:10:59.309
the recession was that much
more severe.

00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:10.473
The matter is much more complex
when one turns to financial

00:11:10.473 --> 00:11:18.306
overextension recessions.
Thinking about the limited

00:11:18.306 --> 00:11:22.160
sample of data,
it falls into two broad

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.918
categories.
The first is the recessions

00:11:25.918 --> 00:11:29.730
that didn't happen or happened
only barely.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:34.313
There was a pretty exciting
financial crisis in 1987 and

00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:38.557
nothing really happened.
There was a pretty exciting

00:11:38.557 --> 00:11:42.019
financial crisis for those
involved in 1998.

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:44.835
In neither case,
if I gave you the data on

00:11:44.835 --> 00:11:46.896
unemployment,
GNP, consumption,

00:11:46.896 --> 00:11:50.948
any real variable and I didn't
give you the time scale and I

00:11:50.948 --> 00:11:55.000
said--What year did we have a
20% stock market crash?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.743
What year did we have a really
dramatic set of dislocations in

00:11:58.743 --> 00:12:01.750
financial markets as a major
hedge fund failed?

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:06.256
You wouldn't be able to see it.
Even the 2001 recession,

00:12:06.256 --> 00:12:11.286
which was associated with the
bursting of the NASDAQ bubble,

00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:16.085
is a pretty minimal recession.
In retrospect,

00:12:16.085 --> 00:12:23.461
with the data revised,
there is no two-quarter period

00:12:23.461 --> 00:12:28.821
when GDP declined.
There are two quarters in which

00:12:28.821 --> 00:12:31.817
GDP declined,
but they're separated by a

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:34.659
quarter of modest positive
growth.

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:39.626
It is not the case that all
financial crises,

00:12:39.626 --> 00:12:46.399
or even most financial crises,
lead to economic downturns.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:53.179
Some have a natural explanation
of that.

00:12:53.179 --> 00:12:58.534
Essentially,
they explain that the financial

00:12:58.534 --> 00:13:06.504
sector is only one small part of
the economy--that the decline in

00:13:06.504 --> 00:13:13.228
the financial sector of the
economy is not of that much

00:13:13.228 --> 00:13:17.967
consequence.
With reasonable policy

00:13:17.967 --> 00:13:24.780
responses, either with monetary
policy or with fiscal policy,

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:31.820
and automatic stabilizers any
loss in demand can be offset.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:38.351
Not a typical calculation of
this kind would say,

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:45.019
suppose the stock market lost
20% of its value.

00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:51.775
If the value of the stock
market is on the order of the

00:13:51.775 --> 00:13:57.279
value of GNP,
that's a loss of 20% of GNP.

00:13:57.279 --> 00:14:03.490
If the marginal propensity to
consume out of wealth is 4%,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:09.591
the loss is 8/10% of GNP--an
amount that an economy would

00:14:09.591 --> 00:14:14.323
rather not lose,
but hardly the difference

00:14:14.323 --> 00:14:20.247
between economic success and
economic failure and something

00:14:20.247 --> 00:14:26.580
that's potentially offset if
there is some policy response.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:33.731
There is data and evidence for
the view that a significant

00:14:33.731 --> 00:14:41.259
amount of financial disruption
can take place with relatively

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:46.779
little consequence for the real
economy.

00:14:46.779 --> 00:14:58.490
The difficulty is that there
are other data points as well as

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:05.826
1987 and 1998 and 2001.
There are data points that come

00:15:05.826 --> 00:15:09.710
from the United States in the
aftermath of 1929,

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.203
while those,
perhaps, are in so different in

00:15:13.203 --> 00:15:17.671
institutional environment,
with such egregious errors as

00:15:17.671 --> 00:15:22.831
to not be relevant.
There are data points from

00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:29.557
Japan during the 1990s.
There are any number of data

00:15:29.557 --> 00:15:37.589
points from emerging markets in
which the reality of financial

00:15:37.589 --> 00:15:43.909
problems created very large
losses in output.

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:48.585
It's natural to ask,
why is the response to

00:15:48.585 --> 00:15:54.261
financial crises so
heterogeneous with some episodes

00:15:54.261 --> 00:16:00.717
in which they seem to have very
little consequence and some

00:16:00.717 --> 00:16:06.840
episodes in which they seem to
have so very much?

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.419
I think the natural
explanation, though it's

00:16:11.419 --> 00:16:16.850
difficult to prove in any kind
of conclusive way,

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:22.296
is an idea that runs through
the work of many economists and

00:16:22.296 --> 00:16:28.019
probably in recent decades most
strongly through Ben Bernanke's

00:16:28.019 --> 00:16:31.116
work,
suggesting that financial

00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:36.285
intermediation capital is a
substantial contributor to the

00:16:36.285 --> 00:16:41.460
production process.
When it is destroyed,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:50.850
suddenly there are substantial
losses, both to aggregate supply

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:57.235
and to aggregate demand.
I made this point--tried to

00:16:57.235 --> 00:17:02.164
make this point--graphic in a
conversation with one of your

00:17:02.164 --> 00:17:05.309
colleagues by asking the
question,

00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:10.559
suppose one considered the
following macroeconomic shock.

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:16.837
For the next six months,
it will not be possible to make

00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:22.430
and complete a phone call in the
United States.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:28.183
What would be likely to happen
to the GDP of the United States

00:17:28.183 --> 00:17:33.749
and what would be likely to
happen to the performance of the

00:17:33.749 --> 00:17:37.244
American economy?
It's actually sort of an

00:17:37.244 --> 00:17:41.030
interesting question and I don't
have a clue exactly what the

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:45.383
right answer is.
My strong suspicion is that it

00:17:45.383 --> 00:17:51.583
would really be quite a bad
event for the performance of the

00:17:51.583 --> 00:17:55.307
economy.
The question of whether the

00:17:55.307 --> 00:18:00.821
telephone lines would transmit
bits would obviously be very

00:18:00.821 --> 00:18:06.146
important in--or it would only
stop working for the human

00:18:06.146 --> 00:18:10.900
voice--would be a very important
determinant.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.201
In either case,
it's hard to believe that there

00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:20.999
would not be substantial loss of
output and significant loss of

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:27.371
employment as well.
There would be many methods for

00:18:27.371 --> 00:18:33.500
seeking to estimate the value of
the losses,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.032
but I would argue that a
particularly poor method would

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:40.564
be to ask, what's the market
value of all the telephone

00:18:40.564 --> 00:18:43.009
companies?
Let's say the market value of

00:18:43.009 --> 00:18:45.700
all the telephone companies is a
trillion dollars.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:49.129
If they're not going to earn
anything for a year,

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:53.630
then their market value will go
down by $400 billion dollars.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.993
So, we'll multiply $400 billion
dollars by a marginal propensity

00:18:57.993 --> 00:19:01.803
to demand--marginal propensity
to consume--and we'll add

00:19:01.803 --> 00:19:05.960
something for the fact--and
we'll call that lost demand.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.661
We'll say, there needs to be
some increased demand because we

00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:12.999
need to fix the telephones;
so, that'll be some increased

00:19:12.999 --> 00:19:16.633
investment.
That would, it seems to me,

00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:21.208
be the wrong mode of analysis.
In some way,

00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:26.239
one would want to capture the
idea that the production

00:19:26.239 --> 00:19:30.985
potential of the economy would
be lower because the

00:19:30.985 --> 00:19:37.060
opportunities to generate output
out of a given amount of capital

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:42.565
and a given amount of labor
would be impossible without the

00:19:42.565 --> 00:19:48.450
intercommunication that the
telephone makes possible.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:51.594
The results,
I would suggest,

00:19:51.594 --> 00:19:58.445
of that telephone shock would
be lost output and would also be

00:19:58.445 --> 00:20:05.520
lost output without substantial
disinflation benefit because the

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:12.371
lost output would not come in a
way that created lots of goods

00:20:12.371 --> 00:20:19.109
hanging over markets that led to
declines in prices.

00:20:19.109 --> 00:20:23.069
The benefit,
in terms of disinflation,

00:20:23.069 --> 00:20:29.275
of a downturn induced by the
inability to make a phone call

00:20:29.275 --> 00:20:35.161
would be much less than the
benefit of a similar loss of

00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:41.581
output achieved through the more
standard tools of fiscal and

00:20:41.581 --> 00:20:46.669
monetary policy.
I emphasize this last point

00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:52.081
because it connects with the
observation with which I began

00:20:52.081 --> 00:20:57.587
yesterday--that declines in
output associated with financial

00:20:57.587 --> 00:21:00.930
crisis recession,
if avoidable,

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:06.388
probably create a welfare gain
of the kind that Art Okun

00:21:06.388 --> 00:21:12.244
focused so much on and of the
kind that Jim Tobin emphasized

00:21:12.244 --> 00:21:17.802
when he spoke of all those
Harberger triangles filling an

00:21:17.802 --> 00:21:20.373
Okun gap.
And [they]

00:21:20.373 --> 00:21:25.883
are not susceptible to the
critique that what you lose on

00:21:25.883 --> 00:21:31.392
the swings you gain on the
swerves that's associated with

00:21:31.392 --> 00:21:37.000
the more conventional view of
cyclical fluctuations.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.860
It should be clear,
from what I have said,

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:49.865
where I am going.
My suggestion is really,

00:21:49.865 --> 00:21:56.221
to echo Ben Bernanke's
suggestion, that the destruction

00:21:56.221 --> 00:22:03.049
of financial intermediation
capital should be thought of as

00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:10.230
reducing the economy's potential
to generate output and,

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:15.136
in that process,
making people poorer and

00:22:15.136 --> 00:22:19.920
reducing the level of demand as
well.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:26.729
When that process kicks in to a
substantial extent--that,

00:22:26.729 --> 00:22:31.592
I would suggest,
is the occasion on which

00:22:31.592 --> 00:22:38.644
financial crises prove to be
exciting events outside of the

00:22:38.644 --> 00:22:43.630
precincts of Manhattan and
Chicago.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:51.520
The crucial question for
economic policy in responding to

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.029
these crises,
I would suggest,

00:22:56.029 --> 00:23:02.684
is preventing that kind of
destruction of intermediation

00:23:02.684 --> 00:23:08.130
capital from taking place on a
large scale.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:15.638
That brings me to the policy
task that the U.S.

00:23:15.638 --> 00:23:22.329
authorities face at the current
moment.

00:23:22.329 --> 00:23:32.730
I'd like to define the problem
as managing and containing three

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:38.769
separate vicious cycle
mechanisms.

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:43.159
The first is the one that I
spoke about at length

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:48.190
yesterday--what one might call
the liquidation cycle.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.370
The tendency,
more than a tendency,

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:55.579
in the market for fixed-income
instruments,

00:23:55.579 --> 00:24:02.461
particularly mortgage-backed
securities, to some degree in

00:24:02.461 --> 00:24:09.222
the market for housing for
declines in value to give rise

00:24:09.222 --> 00:24:16.103
to selling pressures that create
further declines in value

00:24:16.103 --> 00:24:23.475
reinforcing the vicious cycle.
The second vicious cycle,

00:24:23.475 --> 00:24:28.921
which builds on that,
is what is traditionally

00:24:28.921 --> 00:24:34.609
referred to as the
credit-accelerator cycle.

00:24:34.609 --> 00:24:40.349
A deteriorating financial
economy leads to less lending;

00:24:40.349 --> 00:24:45.440
leads to a deteriorating real
economy;

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:51.900
leads to less capacity to pay
back debt;

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:58.200
leads to declining values of
financial instruments;

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:06.150
leads to further reductions in
lending and the cycle continues.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.841
The third cycle--the third
potentially destabilizing

00:25:10.841 --> 00:25:15.717
mechanism is the one that's
perhaps most familiar--the

00:25:15.717 --> 00:25:20.592
Keynesian mechanism in which
reduced spending leads to

00:25:20.592 --> 00:25:25.559
reduced income leads to reduced
spending and on.

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:31.082
Containing these mutually
reinforcing cycles is,

00:25:31.082 --> 00:25:36.369
I would suggest now,
the central challenge for

00:25:36.369 --> 00:25:41.803
economic policy.
I am not in a position to make

00:25:41.803 --> 00:25:48.277
authoritative estimates of some
of the relevant magnitudes and I

00:25:48.277 --> 00:25:54.032
don't want my estimates to be
given more seriousness than

00:25:54.032 --> 00:25:59.813
their crudity deserves,
which is why I'm not projecting

00:25:59.813 --> 00:26:04.286
them on a screen.
Let me give you some round

00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:10.503
numbers that are quite close to
the judgment of the various

00:26:10.503 --> 00:26:17.042
investment banks and informed
observers who have studied these

00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:22.725
questions.
The equity capital of leveraged

00:26:22.725 --> 00:26:30.480
financial institutions in the
United States totals about two

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:34.291
trillion dollars.
It totaled a little more than

00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:35.880
two trillion dollars a few
months ago;

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.597
it probably totals a little
less than two trillion dollars

00:26:40.597 --> 00:26:45.236
today.
That two trillion dollars of

00:26:45.236 --> 00:26:53.047
capital supported about twenty
trillion dollars of asset

00:26:53.047 --> 00:26:56.168
holding.
In other words,

00:26:56.168 --> 00:27:00.740
those institutions were levered
ten-to-one;

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:06.529
some were levered much more
than ten-to-one.

00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:10.940
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are,
for example,

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:17.083
levered thirty-to-one.
A bank with an 8% capital

00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:22.589
requirement is levered
twelve-to-one;

00:27:22.589 --> 00:27:29.769
others--hedge funds pursuing
certain strategies--are levered

00:27:29.769 --> 00:27:34.150
considerably less than
ten-to-one.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:40.180
On average, the leverage works
out to about ten-to-one--two

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:46.210
trillion dollars of equity
capital, twenty trillion dollars

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.911
of lending.
The losses that have taken

00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:58.282
place over the last nine months
and the projected losses based

00:27:58.282 --> 00:28:04.324
on reasonable models of
fundamentals--these are not

00:28:04.324 --> 00:28:11.212
marked-to-market losses that
build in what might be market

00:28:11.212 --> 00:28:15.655
overreactions.
These are estimates of what

00:28:15.655 --> 00:28:19.465
will happen to mortgage
securities based on assumptions

00:28:19.465 --> 00:28:21.024
that,
for example,

00:28:21.024 --> 00:28:26.160
house prices will decline by
another 15% from current levels.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:35.019
Estimates of those total losses
are about a trillion dollars.

00:28:35.019 --> 00:28:38.567
That trillion-dollar figure
sounds very scary,

00:28:38.567 --> 00:28:42.430
relative to two trillion
dollars of capital in the

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:47.702
intermediation sector.
But, good news--about half

00:28:47.702 --> 00:28:55.140
those losses are outside the
financial intermediary sector.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:00.592
They're Bill Brainard's pension;
they're the State of Nebraska's

00:29:00.592 --> 00:29:03.500
pension fund;
they're the Yale endowment;

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.859
they're life insurance
companies, and the like.

00:29:08.859 --> 00:29:20.650
So, about half are held by
levered intermediaries.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:25.922
And more good news--the levered
intermediaries are mostly,

00:29:25.922 --> 00:29:29.437
sooner or later,
in one way or another,

00:29:29.437 --> 00:29:33.970
going to get tax deductions of
various kinds.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:41.666
When all is said and done,
the losses of capital to the

00:29:41.666 --> 00:29:50.359
intermediation sector represent
about $300 billion dollars.

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:57.176
$300 billion dollars of lost
capital has been offset so far

00:29:57.176 --> 00:30:04.581
by about $150 billion dollars of
capital that has been raised in

00:30:04.581 --> 00:30:10.339
Citigroup's deal with Abu Dhabi
and the like.

00:30:10.339 --> 00:30:15.318
Lost capital,
which can be estimated with

00:30:15.318 --> 00:30:22.288
some degree of accuracy compared
to the next step in this

00:30:22.288 --> 00:30:29.240
calculation,
represents about $150 billion

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:34.008
dollars.
$150 billion dollars of lost

00:30:34.008 --> 00:30:40.579
capital at ten-to-one leverage
means a trillion and a half

00:30:40.579 --> 00:30:47.381
dollars of lost intermediation
capacity or about 7.5% of the

00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:54.530
financial asset holding that was
previously taking place.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:31:01.119
Now, here comes a wild card;
what should happen to the

00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:07.938
leverage of intermediaries in
the face of the events of the

00:31:07.938 --> 00:31:12.074
last nine months?
Well, first of all,

00:31:12.074 --> 00:31:16.863
they probably should have
learned from the last nine

00:31:16.863 --> 00:31:21.934
months that the degree of
leverage with which they were

00:31:21.934 --> 00:31:26.160
operating nine months ago was
excessive.

00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:32.258
Second, they almost certainly
will judge that the volatility

00:31:32.258 --> 00:31:37.737
associated with the assets they
hold and the degree of

00:31:37.737 --> 00:31:42.595
uncertainty about their
portfolios is today very

00:31:42.595 --> 00:31:48.264
substantially greater,
not just than they thought it

00:31:48.264 --> 00:31:52.761
was nine months ago,
but than it objectively was

00:31:52.761 --> 00:31:57.764
nine months ago.
Third, the magnitude of tail

00:31:57.764 --> 00:32:04.134
risk of existential events,
which will cause the solvency

00:32:04.134 --> 00:32:10.390
of their institution to come
into fundamental doubt,

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:18.736
has surely increased as well.
I don't think we have a sound

00:32:18.736 --> 00:32:27.101
basis for estimating how much
prudent institutions will reduce

00:32:27.101 --> 00:32:32.197
their leverage.
The leverage choices they may

00:32:32.197 --> 00:32:36.274
make will, of course,
be very much influenced,

00:32:36.274 --> 00:32:39.627
in some cases,
by the way in which the

00:32:39.627 --> 00:32:43.069
government applies capital
rules.

00:32:43.069 --> 00:32:50.608
If one makes the conservative,
but in my view not absurd,

00:32:50.608 --> 00:32:57.339
assumption that leverage will
be reduced by 10%,

00:32:57.339 --> 00:33:05.983
10% leverage--a 10% reduction
in leverage on a $20 trillion

00:33:05.983 --> 00:33:15.373
base of asset holding represents
the loss of another $2 trillion

00:33:15.373 --> 00:33:23.567
in lending capacity.
Add the $1.5 trillion and the

00:33:23.567 --> 00:33:31.210
$2 trillion and you are looking
at the loss of,

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:37.722
on the order of,
$3.5 trillion or on the order

00:33:37.722 --> 00:33:46.259
of 15% of the previous financial
intermediation capacity.

00:33:46.259 --> 00:33:53.271
It is not unreasonable at all
to suppose that this is a shock

00:33:53.271 --> 00:34:00.516
that is of substantial magnitude
relative to the functioning of

00:34:00.516 --> 00:34:07.178
the financial system and to the
extent that the economy is

00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:14.540
dependent on the ability to get
credit to the functioning of the

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:20.443
economy.
At root, it is the challenge of

00:34:20.443 --> 00:34:26.949
policy to address this shock in
this environment.

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:35.909
What are the tools that are
available to policymakers?

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:42.659
The first imperative of a
policy and one that has been

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:49.409
pursued in this crisis since the
beginning of 2008,

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:56.489
albeit in my judgment somewhat
belatedly, is to seek to

00:34:56.489 --> 00:35:02.633
maintain aggregate demand.
Whatever else is happening,

00:35:02.633 --> 00:35:08.129
an environment of this kind is
likely to be a disinflationary

00:35:08.129 --> 00:35:12.414
environment over time.
It is likely to be an

00:35:12.414 --> 00:35:18.210
environment in which if spending
is reduced, asset values will

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:24.099
decline, further compounding the
degree of economic damage.

00:35:24.099 --> 00:35:33.019
How do policymakers seek to
maintain aggregate demand?

00:35:33.019 --> 00:35:38.170
Before the events of the last
eighteen months,

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:42.519
if asked to comment on this
subject,

00:35:42.519 --> 00:35:48.165
I would have said the dominant
tool of short-run stabilization

00:35:48.165 --> 00:35:53.070
policy should be monetary policy
not fiscal policy.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.106
I would have explained that
fiscal policy,

00:35:57.106 --> 00:36:03.111
except in the shortest of runs,
was likely to be offset by the

00:36:03.111 --> 00:36:07.897
Federal Reserve.
So, it would end up affecting

00:36:07.897 --> 00:36:12.949
the composition of output,
not the level of output.

00:36:12.949 --> 00:36:16.732
I would further have explained
that it was much more

00:36:16.732 --> 00:36:21.183
destructive of long-run values
to try to vary spending or the

00:36:21.183 --> 00:36:25.411
tax structure in a short-run way
in order to stabilize the

00:36:25.411 --> 00:36:29.350
economy;
that was best accomplished

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:36.707
through monetary policy.
I continue to regard that as a

00:36:36.707 --> 00:36:44.320
reasonable judgment about policy
in normal times.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:49.497
It seems to me that,
while it is appropriate in this

00:36:49.497 --> 00:36:54.980
environment to seek to use
monetary policy as a tool of

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.897
stimulus,
there are several

00:36:57.897 --> 00:37:03.721
considerations that suggest that
it should not be the sole tool

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:10.096
of stimulus in this environment.
First, there is much more than

00:37:10.096 --> 00:37:16.681
the normal degree of uncertainty
about what the impact of changes

00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:23.059
in interest rates will be on the
level of aggregate demand.

00:37:23.059 --> 00:37:27.500
Imagine, for example,
an intermediary that is

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:32.348
capital-constrained.
It only has a billion dollars

00:37:32.348 --> 00:37:38.059
of capital and it therefore can
only lend ten billion dollars.

00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:41.760
Imagine now that the rate of
interest is brought down;

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:46.858
it can still only lend ten
billion dollars and the rate at

00:37:46.858 --> 00:37:52.494
which it lends will still be the
point at which the demand curve

00:37:52.494 --> 00:37:56.429
for its loans is at ten billion
dollars.

00:37:56.429 --> 00:38:00.302
The only result of bringing
down the interest rate will be a

00:38:00.302 --> 00:38:02.599
reduction in its cost of
funding,

00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:07.014
which over time will allow it
to rebuild its capital,

00:38:07.014 --> 00:38:11.089
but that is a very slow
process--a very different

00:38:11.089 --> 00:38:15.503
situation than the more normal
situation in which the

00:38:15.503 --> 00:38:20.315
intermediary is not constrained.
Is this the case for most

00:38:20.315 --> 00:38:22.639
intermediaries?
It's very difficult to know.

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:27.920
Most intermediaries are not at
their capital constraint,

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:33.777
but they probably are planning
for some given cushion relative

00:38:33.777 --> 00:38:38.312
to their capital constraint.
In this environment,

00:38:38.312 --> 00:38:42.041
it is likely that the
multiplier for monetary policy

00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:45.916
is less and it is surely more
uncertain and that is an

00:38:45.916 --> 00:38:49.280
inhibition to the use of
monetary policy.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:54.682
Second inhibition to the use of
monetary policy as a sole tool

00:38:54.682 --> 00:38:58.921
is: most of the time,
with respect to most economic

00:38:58.921 --> 00:39:03.475
policies, we may not know what
the multiplier associated with

00:39:03.475 --> 00:39:08.814
the instrument is,
but we know where we have set

00:39:08.814 --> 00:39:13.951
the policy dial.
Through all of modern economic

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:19.442
experience, until nine months
ago, it would be completely

00:39:19.442 --> 00:39:24.834
impossible to use any known
econometric technique to say

00:39:24.834 --> 00:39:31.110
anything about the impact of
changes in the Fed Funds Rate,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:35.862
as distinct from changes in
LIBOR, on the behavior of the

00:39:35.862 --> 00:39:39.341
aggregate economy.
They were perfectly

00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:44.217
multi-linear as the spread
between them was small and

00:39:44.217 --> 00:39:48.820
little fluctuating.
In the last nine months,

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:54.431
a substantial spread has
emerged between the Fed Funds

00:39:54.431 --> 00:39:59.406
Rate--the rate at which banks
lend to each other

00:39:59.406 --> 00:40:05.546
overnight--and the Interbank
rate that prevails over longer

00:40:05.546 --> 00:40:09.967
horizons.
For a variety of reasons that I

00:40:09.967 --> 00:40:15.159
don't have time to get into,
it is almost certainly the case

00:40:15.159 --> 00:40:20.351
that large parts of this spread
reflect the credit risk that

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:24.840
banks experience when they lend
to each other.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:29.785
Probably, the right indicator
for monetary policy is not the

00:40:29.785 --> 00:40:32.168
Fed Funds Rate,
but is LIBOR,

00:40:32.168 --> 00:40:36.447
in which case there has been
rather less easing of monetary

00:40:36.447 --> 00:40:40.800
policy than looking at the Fed
Funds Rate would suggest;

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.380
but, one cannot make that
decision in a definitive way.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.142
So, easing monetary policy as
the Fed has been doing for some

00:40:51.142 --> 00:40:55.667
time and as the Fed did today in
lowering the rate another

00:40:55.667 --> 00:41:00.510
twenty-five basis points is
almost certainly appropriate.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:06.010
But it is almost certainly not
appropriate to rely only on a

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:11.325
single instrument in this
context because one is uncertain

00:41:11.325 --> 00:41:16.360
about how much of that
instrument one is applying,

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.665
because one is uncertain about
what the multiplier of that

00:41:21.665 --> 00:41:25.388
instrument is,
and because in the current

00:41:25.388 --> 00:41:31.066
context there are reasons to be
concerned about the pernicious

00:41:31.066 --> 00:41:36.000
side effects of excessively low
interest rates.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:42.136
Two stand out.
The first--while in general I

00:41:42.136 --> 00:41:49.513
am very much with the Keynesian
consensus that the inflation

00:41:49.513 --> 00:41:54.639
process depends upon aggregate
demand,

00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:58.404
in the current context,
lower interest rates may well

00:41:58.404 --> 00:42:02.531
contribute directly to the
inflation process through their

00:42:02.531 --> 00:42:06.658
impact on the dollar and through
their impact on commodity

00:42:06.658 --> 00:42:10.579
prices.
The second--while I give less

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:17.052
weight than most to critiques of
a policy environment that blame

00:42:17.052 --> 00:42:23.320
our current problems on the fact
that interest rates were kept

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:29.280
low for a long time responding
to the last recession,

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.117
it seems to me reasonable to
give some weight to the concern

00:42:34.117 --> 00:42:38.956
that excessively low interest
rates set the stage for future

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:41.322
bubbles.
I, therefore,

00:42:41.322 --> 00:42:47.703
think it's appropriate that the
Congress acted--and I suspect

00:42:47.703 --> 00:42:53.445
the Congress won't need to act
again--to provide fiscal

00:42:53.445 --> 00:42:59.138
stimulus to the economy.
In advocating fiscal stimulus

00:42:59.138 --> 00:43:04.536
just after the turn of the year,
I urged that the stimulus be

00:43:04.536 --> 00:43:09.573
timely because experience
suggests that the difficulty of

00:43:09.573 --> 00:43:14.881
lags and implementation have
traditionally been serious with

00:43:14.881 --> 00:43:20.672
respect to fiscal policy.
That it be targeted--designed

00:43:20.672 --> 00:43:27.199
to generate as much spending as
possible as quickly as possible,

00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:30.639
which meant that tax breaks
should be channeled to those

00:43:30.639 --> 00:43:34.330
with lower incomes rather than
those with higher incomes.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:39.033
That recommendation if adopted;
means that taxes--means that

00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:43.204
benefit programs would go to
people like food stamps and

00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:46.010
unemployment insurance
recipients,

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:47.643
who were likely to have a very
high-margin propensity to

00:43:47.643 --> 00:43:53.237
consume.
The political process was

00:43:53.237 --> 00:44:00.573
unwilling to do that.
And that the fiscal stimulus

00:44:00.573 --> 00:44:06.396
must be temporary in light of
the seriousness of the country's

00:44:06.396 --> 00:44:13.617
long-run fiscal problems.
Macroeconomic policy in this

00:44:13.617 --> 00:44:21.900
environment can help to maintain
aggregate demand,

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:29.744
but it does not address the
disruption in the productive

00:44:29.744 --> 00:44:38.445
mechanism associated with the
decline in the financial sectors

00:44:38.445 --> 00:44:45.875
capacity for intermediation.
There are a number of tools of

00:44:45.875 --> 00:44:50.268
policy directed at the
maintenance of financial

00:44:50.268 --> 00:44:54.301
stability.
One has received overwhelming

00:44:54.301 --> 00:44:58.826
emphasis to date and it is
entirely appropriate,

00:44:58.826 --> 00:45:03.639
but I would suggest
presumptively insufficient.

00:45:03.639 --> 00:45:11.061
That is, the Fed,
through a dizzying array of new

00:45:11.061 --> 00:45:19.807
facilities and ad hoc actions,
has made clear that it stands

00:45:19.807 --> 00:45:27.925
ready against good collateral to
provide liquidity to financial

00:45:27.925 --> 00:45:33.759
institutions.
Now, go back to the

00:45:33.759 --> 00:45:43.010
calculations that I went through
a moment ago.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:50.800
I emphasized the loss of
capital and I represented the

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:59.766
desired reduction in levels of
leverage associated with a more

00:45:59.766 --> 00:46:05.836
risky environment.
I did not say anything in doing

00:46:05.836 --> 00:46:11.235
those calculations about the
difficulty of attracting funds,

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:15.170
about the difficulty of
borrowing funds.

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:23.429
I did not raise the concern
about bank runs and the like.

00:46:23.429 --> 00:46:33.030
The provision of liquidity by
the Fed is necessary;

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:38.683
without it, in my judgment,
it is very likely that we would

00:46:38.683 --> 00:46:44.239
have seen problematic runs on a
number of institutions.

00:46:44.239 --> 00:46:49.467
I believe the Fed behaved in a
broadly correct way in

00:46:49.467 --> 00:46:53.789
responding to the events at Bear
Stearns.

00:46:53.789 --> 00:46:58.581
It is certainly possible that
if the Fed had not acted,

00:46:58.581 --> 00:47:03.372
the losses to Bear Stearns
shareholders would have been

00:47:03.372 --> 00:47:05.822
total.
There would have been

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:10.062
substantial disruption in the
bond markets for a period of

00:47:10.062 --> 00:47:12.844
five days.
A valuable lesson would have

00:47:12.844 --> 00:47:16.537
been taught and the matter--and
the world would have moved

00:47:16.537 --> 00:47:19.897
forward.
It is certainly possible that

00:47:19.897 --> 00:47:22.860
that is the case.
It seems to me,

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:27.788
one doesn't need to assign a
very high probability to the

00:47:27.788 --> 00:47:33.157
alternative scenario in which
runs on Bear Stearns cascaded to

00:47:33.157 --> 00:47:37.779
other institutions,
which then cascaded to other

00:47:37.779 --> 00:47:42.619
institutions and led to
substantial destruction of many

00:47:42.619 --> 00:47:47.280
institutions that were thought
previously viable.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.867
I don't think one has to assign
a very great probability to the

00:47:51.867 --> 00:47:55.789
latter event to believe the
rescue of Bear Stearns was

00:47:55.789 --> 00:48:00.281
worthwhile.
I, myself, would assign a much

00:48:00.281 --> 00:48:07.157
greater than 50% probability to
a major systemic-risk incident

00:48:07.157 --> 00:48:13.469
if the damage at Bear Stearns
had not been contained.

00:48:13.469 --> 00:48:17.467
In any event,
while noting the necessity of

00:48:17.467 --> 00:48:23.463
all of that, I want to emphasize
its insufficiency--that it does

00:48:23.463 --> 00:48:28.793
nothing about either the
reduction in capital and it does

00:48:28.793 --> 00:48:35.360
very little about the reduction
in desired degrees of leverage,

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.639
that I would suggest are at the
root of the problem.

00:48:40.639 --> 00:48:46.961
That brings me to what is,
I think, the second crucial

00:48:46.961 --> 00:48:53.818
tool of financial stability,
which is the most important

00:48:53.818 --> 00:49:00.010
financial policy issue in the
current environment.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.958
Unfortunately,
by its nature,

00:49:01.958 --> 00:49:05.785
it is difficult to tell the
vigor with which it is being

00:49:05.785 --> 00:49:10.218
pursued.
That is the infusion of new

00:49:10.218 --> 00:49:15.150
capital into financial
institutions.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:21.395
Notice that if financial
institutions raised their level

00:49:21.395 --> 00:49:28.208
capital, then at any given level
of leverage they are able to

00:49:28.208 --> 00:49:35.021
raise their degree of lending
and you are able to reinstitute

00:49:35.021 --> 00:49:41.039
the intermediation capacity that
has been lost.

00:49:41.039 --> 00:49:45.612
There is a crucial
un-internalized externality in

00:49:45.612 --> 00:49:49.900
our current system of financial
regulation.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:57.060
Institutions are regulated and
their soundness is judged on the

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:03.528
basis of a capital ratio--on the
basis of their degree of

00:50:03.528 --> 00:50:08.362
leverage.
They are pressured rationally

00:50:08.362 --> 00:50:15.600
enough not to have deposits that
are short-term liabilities that

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:21.690
are too large relative to their
degree of capital.

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:27.680
Notice that an institution can
acquire--can reduce its--can

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:33.567
improve its capital ratio or
reduce its leverage in one of

00:50:33.567 --> 00:50:38.504
two ways.
It can reduce its leverage by

00:50:38.504 --> 00:50:45.816
shrinking its balance sheet or
it can reduce its leverage by

00:50:45.816 --> 00:50:51.732
expanding its level of capital.
If the institution is

00:50:51.732 --> 00:50:56.596
indifferent between those two
choices, society is clearly not

00:50:56.596 --> 00:50:59.920
indifferent between those two
choices.

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:07.019
It has a strong preference for
the issuance of capital.

00:51:07.019 --> 00:51:11.383
Or to put essentially the same
point in a different way,

00:51:11.383 --> 00:51:14.159
if an institution raises
capital,

00:51:14.159 --> 00:51:19.053
it dilutes its shareholders and
a substantial part of the

00:51:19.053 --> 00:51:24.383
benefit of that extra capital
goes to the holders of its risky

00:51:24.383 --> 00:51:28.687
debt,
whose claims have now become

00:51:28.687 --> 00:51:32.435
more secure.
As a consequence,

00:51:32.435 --> 00:51:37.538
the private incentive for
capital raising,

00:51:37.538 --> 00:51:44.010
even with a capital rule
operating as regulation,

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:50.820
is substantially less than the
social incentive.

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:57.118
One hopes that the regulatory
system is internalizing this

00:51:57.118 --> 00:52:02.201
externality--is placing
substantial pressure on

00:52:02.201 --> 00:52:07.472
institutions,
who after all are enormously

00:52:07.472 --> 00:52:14.861
dependent on their relationship
with the financial authorities

00:52:14.861 --> 00:52:21.039
to raise more capital than they
otherwise would.

00:52:21.039 --> 00:52:31.091
It is very difficult to know
from the outside to what extent

00:52:31.091 --> 00:52:36.801
that is taking place.
A prudent regulator who was

00:52:36.801 --> 00:52:40.981
forcing an institution to raise
more capital would conspire with

00:52:40.981 --> 00:52:45.095
that institution to not have it
be known that the regulator was

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:48.480
forcing the institution to raise
more capital,

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:57.019
lest the health of the
institution come into question.

00:52:57.019 --> 00:53:00.490
Certainly there have been a
number of favorable developments

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:03.550
involving the raising of capital
in recent months,

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:11.073
but in my judgment and the kind
of numbers I presented suggest

00:53:11.073 --> 00:53:16.614
that we have a long way to go.
I would suggest,

00:53:16.614 --> 00:53:21.897
of particular importance in
this regard is the capital

00:53:21.897 --> 00:53:25.485
situation of the
government-sponsored

00:53:25.485 --> 00:53:29.745
enterprises,
which are levered thirty-to-one

00:53:29.745 --> 00:53:34.876
and which have a crucial role in
this environment in supporting

00:53:34.876 --> 00:53:38.358
the mortgage market.
To date, they have been

00:53:38.358 --> 00:53:42.475
encouraged to buy more mortgages
through a reduction in their

00:53:42.475 --> 00:53:46.112
capital requirement and there
have been rather diffuse

00:53:46.112 --> 00:53:50.229
statements about it as their
hope and intention to raise more

00:53:50.229 --> 00:53:53.764
capital in the future.
We've been moving towards the

00:53:53.764 --> 00:53:57.315
future;
they have not yet raised the

00:53:57.315 --> 00:54:00.350
capital.
Some rather skeptical

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:05.766
statements about the need to
raise capital have come from

00:54:05.766 --> 00:54:11.568
their management with as yet
relatively little criticism from

00:54:11.568 --> 00:54:15.340
the public
authorities--liquidity,

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:24.508
raising capital.
The third broad policy question

00:54:24.508 --> 00:54:29.699
involves more direct
intervention in markets.

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:33.124
In my judgment,
any attempt to support the

00:54:33.124 --> 00:54:36.799
housing market,
in general, at current levels

00:54:36.799 --> 00:54:40.812
would be misguided.
There is little reason to

00:54:40.812 --> 00:54:45.416
believe that house prices have
yet fallen to fundamental

00:54:45.416 --> 00:54:50.019
levels, let alone fallen through
fundamental levels.

00:54:50.019 --> 00:54:54.014
The lesson of the Japanese
experience is that price keeping

00:54:54.014 --> 00:54:58.010
operations by governments delay
processes of adjustment.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:02.602
Why would anyone want to buy
something whose price is being

00:55:02.602 --> 00:55:06.958
supported by the government
since it's likely that there

00:55:06.958 --> 00:55:11.313
will be further downwards
adjustment rather than upwards

00:55:11.313 --> 00:55:16.726
adjustment?
Where there is a much stronger

00:55:16.726 --> 00:55:24.453
case is for policy to support
the mortgage-backed security

00:55:24.453 --> 00:55:32.045
market where prices reflect
expectations of terribly high

00:55:32.045 --> 00:55:37.872
default performances.
Some mortgage-backed securities

00:55:37.872 --> 00:55:42.552
on some classes of subprime debt
are building in the expectation

00:55:42.552 --> 00:55:46.489
that more than half the houses
will be foreclosed;

00:55:46.489 --> 00:55:54.256
estimates that go way beyond
what even fairly pessimistic

00:55:54.256 --> 00:55:59.082
forecasts suggest.
By stealth, a rather

00:55:59.082 --> 00:56:04.521
substantial program of support
for the mortgage-backed

00:56:04.521 --> 00:56:09.422
securities market is under way.
Key elements include the

00:56:09.422 --> 00:56:12.130
actions of the
government-sponsored enterprises

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:15.662
that I referred to that will
enable $180 billion of increased

00:56:15.662 --> 00:56:18.369
purchasing of mortgage-backed
securities.

00:56:18.369 --> 00:56:25.184
A similar change on the part of
the federal home loan banks and

00:56:25.184 --> 00:56:30.130
if, with that thirty-to-one
leverage ratio,

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:34.945
the GSE's are caused to raise
significantly more capital,

00:56:34.945 --> 00:56:39.503
there is the prospect of
significantly further support

00:56:39.503 --> 00:56:43.460
for the mortgage-backed
securities market,

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:49.436
whose greater health would
impact both the availability of

00:56:49.436 --> 00:56:53.735
credit to potential new
homeowners and the

00:56:53.735 --> 00:57:00.340
availability--and the health--of
the financial institutions that

00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:07.388
are holding their securities.
I think--and I will not dwell

00:57:07.388 --> 00:57:13.562
on the point for reasons of
time--that there is also a

00:57:13.562 --> 00:57:19.620
strong case for policy measures
directed at strategic

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:26.261
intervention in near foreclosure
situations to promote the

00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:33.949
writing down of mortgages as an
alternative to foreclosure.

00:57:33.949 --> 00:57:38.964
Given that, available estimates
suggest that the losses

00:57:38.964 --> 00:57:44.814
associated with the foreclosure
process itself can easily add up

00:57:44.814 --> 00:57:50.849
to more than half the value--the
residual value--of the home.

00:57:50.849 --> 00:57:56.360
Finally, I would highlight the
international dimension of

00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:00.099
policy and would stress two
aspects.

00:58:00.099 --> 00:58:07.059
The global dynamic here is that
two things are happening.

00:58:07.059 --> 00:58:12.070
First, U.S.
aggregate demand is falling.

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:17.010
Second, the fall in the dollar
associated with all the various

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:22.193
ramifications of these financial
events are switching expenditure

00:58:22.193 --> 00:58:26.809
from the rest of the world
towards the United States.

00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:30.909
Third, some of the forces
operating in the United States

00:58:30.909 --> 00:58:35.306
are also operating to reduce
aggregate demand in the rest of

00:58:35.306 --> 00:58:38.760
the world.
A crucial priority for policy

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:43.416
coordination in that context has
to be the stimulation of

00:58:43.416 --> 00:58:47.489
aggregate demand in the rest of
the world and,

00:58:47.489 --> 00:58:52.675
probably, the achievement of a
more balanced pattern of dollar

00:58:52.675 --> 00:58:55.344
depreciation.
To date, the dollar has

00:58:55.344 --> 00:58:58.981
depreciated disproportionately
against a very small number of

00:58:58.981 --> 00:59:01.643
currencies,
principally the Euro,

00:59:01.643 --> 00:59:06.823
that stand for countries that
do not have problems like those

00:59:06.823 --> 00:59:11.744
of the United States and that
allow their exchange rate to

00:59:11.744 --> 00:59:14.504
fluctuate;
a more balanced path would be

00:59:14.504 --> 00:59:17.696
desirable.
Second priority for policy

00:59:17.696 --> 00:59:23.680
coordination is with respect to
the very large quantities of

00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:28.650
liquidity that are now managed
by governments.

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:31.308
They represent,
potentially,

00:59:31.308 --> 00:59:35.838
an enormously important
resource in the current

00:59:35.838 --> 00:59:41.352
context--pools of patient
capital that can be managed for

00:59:41.352 --> 00:59:46.669
the long term and that could
provide liquidity to badly

00:59:46.669 --> 00:59:55.832
distorted fixed-income markets,
but have not yet done so on a

00:59:55.832 --> 01:00:02.154
substantial scale.
These sets of measures

01:00:02.154 --> 01:00:08.854
represent, I believe,
a policy approach that offers a

01:00:08.854 --> 01:00:12.767
very good,
though not certain,

01:00:12.767 --> 01:00:17.949
chance of containing the
current situation.

01:00:17.949 --> 01:00:23.142
The risks, it seems to me,
are much more on the side of it

01:00:23.142 --> 01:00:28.334
being pursued with too little
vigor than on the side of it

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:32.687
being pursued with too much.
In particular,

01:00:32.687 --> 01:00:38.437
the imperative of the rapid
recapitalization of financial

01:00:38.437 --> 01:00:44.037
institutions stands out.
I will for reasons of time

01:00:44.037 --> 01:00:50.126
leave a discussion that I had
intended, raising questions

01:00:50.126 --> 01:00:56.325
about the regulatory structure
and changes that might make

01:00:56.325 --> 01:01:01.980
crises of these kind less likely
in the future,

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:09.260
to the question period.
But, I will just make five

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.952
telegraphic observations.
First, it is the irony of

01:01:14.952 --> 01:01:21.991
financial crisis that the very
forces that caused it are the

01:01:21.991 --> 01:01:29.030
opposite--are also the very
forces that are necessary to get

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:33.213
out of it.
If the world's problem eighteen

01:01:33.213 --> 01:01:37.692
months ago was that there was
too much greed and too little

01:01:37.692 --> 01:01:41.293
fear,
the world's problem today is

01:01:41.293 --> 01:01:46.619
that there is too much fear and
too little greed.

01:01:46.619 --> 01:01:51.194
The policies that would have
been highly constructive

01:01:51.194 --> 01:01:55.769
eighteen months ago in
inhibiting undesirable lending

01:01:55.769 --> 01:01:59.376
are potentially
counterproductive today in

01:01:59.376 --> 01:02:06.293
inhibiting constructive lending.
Second, there's an overwhelming

01:02:06.293 --> 01:02:12.402
case for stronger consumer
regulation in all financial

01:02:12.402 --> 01:02:16.106
areas.
If one studies carefully the

01:02:16.106 --> 01:02:21.344
extent to which subprime
mortgages at egregious interest

01:02:21.344 --> 01:02:26.676
rates were taken on to help
people get out of credit card

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:32.288
debt at super egregious rates,
one has a sense of the greater

01:02:32.288 --> 01:02:36.541
complexity of the problem and
the need to view it from an

01:02:36.541 --> 01:02:42.976
integrated consumer perspective.
Third, the government should be

01:02:42.976 --> 01:02:50.286
paid for providing the safety
net and the modalities that are

01:02:50.286 --> 01:02:57.962
necessary to do that--need to be
much more carefully designed so

01:02:57.962 --> 01:03:03.809
that if everything works out
splendidly in,

01:03:03.809 --> 01:03:07.953
for example,
the Bear Stearns transaction,

01:03:07.953 --> 01:03:13.713
the government would be a
beneficiary of the success since

01:03:13.713 --> 01:03:18.563
it surely will be a
beneficiary--surely will bear

01:03:18.563 --> 01:03:23.010
the burden if everything else is
lost.

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:27.960
Fourth, the dominant--the
single most important area for

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:33.269
thought in thinking about the
future of financial regulation

01:03:33.269 --> 01:03:36.690
is the problem of
pro-cyclicality.

01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:44.684
Prudent behavior by individual
institutions involves shrinkage

01:03:44.684 --> 01:03:51.839
of balance sheets in bad times.
Everyone's effort to shrink

01:03:51.839 --> 01:03:57.601
balance sheets in bad times has
potentially catastrophic

01:03:57.601 --> 01:04:03.556
consequences for the system.
How to regulate to avoid

01:04:03.556 --> 01:04:08.969
pro-cyclicality is a fourth
crucial imperative.

01:04:08.969 --> 01:04:16.269
Fifth, these issues should be
addressed slowly,

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:22.152
carefully, and deliberately;
as I suggested,

01:04:22.152 --> 01:04:26.718
the problems of getting us out
of a situation of this kind are

01:04:26.718 --> 01:04:31.283
in many ways the opposite of the
problems of preventing future

01:04:31.283 --> 01:04:34.697
financial crises.
It will be tempting,

01:04:34.697 --> 01:04:39.645
but would be unfortunate,
to address the concerns through

01:04:39.645 --> 01:04:44.770
whatever officials do when
they're not sure what to do,

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:51.023
which is reorganize.
Our central challenges involve

01:04:51.023 --> 01:04:56.952
the questions of how we define
capital, how we regulate

01:04:56.952 --> 01:05:00.322
capital,
for whom we regulate capital,

01:05:00.322 --> 01:05:04.955
how we avoid pro-cyclicality.
Until we know the answers to

01:05:04.955 --> 01:05:08.806
those questions,
it will be difficult to think

01:05:08.806 --> 01:05:13.854
intelligently about what the
right bureaucratic structure of

01:05:13.854 --> 01:05:18.931
regulation is.
All of this is to suggest to

01:05:18.931 --> 01:05:25.464
the students here that the
macroeconomics of the early

01:05:25.464 --> 01:05:32.120
twenty-first century will be no
less important than the

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:40.010
macroeconomics of the latter
part of the twentieth century.

01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:44.604
That macroeconomics has a good
chance of being much more

01:05:44.604 --> 01:05:48.614
centrally involved with
financial issues than the

01:05:48.614 --> 01:05:53.209
macroeconomics of the late
twentieth century--or perhaps

01:05:53.209 --> 01:05:59.067
fairness requires me to say,
the macroeconomics practiced

01:05:59.067 --> 01:06:04.670
outside of New Haven in the late
twentieth century.

01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:15.078
The many, many imprecisions and
speculations in these remarks,

01:06:15.078 --> 01:06:20.465
I apologize for,
but offer as a modest and

01:06:20.465 --> 01:06:25.746
inadequate defense that they
point up that there's a great

01:06:25.746 --> 01:06:31.397
deal of very valuable research
to be done that will contribute

01:06:31.397 --> 01:06:35.010
to our understanding of
economies.

01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:37.712
Also, I believe,
to Art Okun's vision,

01:06:37.712 --> 01:06:40.926
of harnessing that
understanding to help make

01:06:40.926 --> 01:06:45.090
better and more secure lives for
our fellow citizens.

01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:46.190
Thank you very much.

01:06:56.159 --> 01:06:59.697
I went over my time,
but I've got some time for

01:06:59.697 --> 01:07:02.420
questions.
Jeff?

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.654
Student: Larry,
do you think that Secretary

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:09.550
Paulson's recommendations are
appropriate to the problem?

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:11.796
Or do they that seem to be a
dusted off failed answer to a

01:07:11.796 --> 01:07:13.355
different set of problems.
Secretary Paulson's

01:07:13.355 --> 01:07:14.602
recommendations last year
addressed a presumed crisis

01:07:14.602 --> 01:07:15.920
overregulation diminishing.
You seem to suggest that the

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.263
real problems are misperceptions
of risk and not mistaken

01:07:17.263 --> 01:07:18.270
regulation.
Will the Secretary's repurposed

01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:19.637
proposals die on the vine or
will they still get political

01:07:19.637 --> 01:07:24.119
traction despite your warning?
Sorry about the mixed metaphor!

01:07:24.119 --> 01:07:27.861
Professor Larry Summers:
Get traction on the vine,

01:07:27.861 --> 01:07:32.073
I guess.
There's certain--I'm going to

01:07:32.073 --> 01:07:39.526
not associate myself with all
the words you used in describing

01:07:39.526 --> 01:07:44.977
the Secretary's proposals,
though I can't understand

01:07:44.977 --> 01:07:48.030
why--I can understand why you
use them.

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:55.992
I think that it is almost
always a good idea to bet on

01:07:55.992 --> 01:08:03.851
inertia in anything political.
I suspect that in the remainder

01:08:03.851 --> 01:08:10.051
of this election year it is very
unlikely that anything will get

01:08:10.051 --> 01:08:15.465
done that doesn't appear
necessary to respond to current

01:08:15.465 --> 01:08:18.204
difficulty.
And usually,

01:08:18.204 --> 01:08:22.185
when there's a new
administration or a new

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:28.010
secretary, the problem is not
excessive fealty to the visions

01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:32.143
of the previous secretary,
the problem is a desperate

01:08:32.143 --> 01:08:34.130
effort at artificial product
differentiation.

01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:37.827
There were a number of issues I
found when I was at the Treasury

01:08:37.827 --> 01:08:41.407
where there was a certain way to
do it that was kind of a good

01:08:41.407 --> 01:08:43.619
idea and,
actually, our predecessors had

01:08:43.619 --> 01:08:46.989
more or less figured it out.
It was my experience that we

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:50.155
never decided to say,
let's really work to get

01:08:50.155 --> 01:08:52.970
Secretary Brady's good idea in
place.

01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:56.761
We always found a few points of
minor difference and found a

01:08:56.761 --> 01:08:59.010
variety of ways of relabeling
it.

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.544
That was when we thought the
ideas were good and he had it

01:09:01.544 --> 01:09:04.546
right.
In the cases where we didn't,

01:09:04.546 --> 01:09:10.986
it was much more dramatic.
So, I would be surprised if the

01:09:10.986 --> 01:09:18.811
ideas contained in that report
prove to be a dominant starting

01:09:18.811 --> 01:09:24.496
point for discussion.
To be sure, I do want to say

01:09:24.496 --> 01:09:28.061
one thing.
There is one thing that that

01:09:28.061 --> 01:09:33.779
report was getting at and there
is one aspect of our system that

01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:38.862
I think we need to think very
carefully about and it goes

01:09:38.862 --> 01:09:42.056
deep.
That is, do we believe in

01:09:42.056 --> 01:09:46.630
competitive regulation of
financial institutions?

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:50.992
We have a banking system and it
has for a long time been a

01:09:50.992 --> 01:09:55.661
fairly sacred principle that we
have a so-called "dual banking

01:09:55.661 --> 01:09:57.211
system."
The idea is,

01:09:57.211 --> 01:09:59.999
well you get to choose your
regulator and therefore no

01:09:59.999 --> 01:10:03.050
regulator can be too stupid
because if they're unreasonable

01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:04.932
or stupid,
then people will choose a

01:10:04.932 --> 01:10:07.618
different regulator.
Well, that's one way of

01:10:07.618 --> 01:10:10.337
thinking about it.
Another is that if regulators

01:10:10.337 --> 01:10:13.069
like to have more jurisdiction
and they like to do more stuff,

01:10:13.069 --> 01:10:19.405
competitive regulation is a
prescription for limited

01:10:19.405 --> 01:10:23.208
regulation.
Implicit in Secretary

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:27.792
Paulson's--sort of,
in the language one might

01:10:27.792 --> 01:10:33.780
expect from a Republican,
emphasis on efficiency and the

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:39.717
avoidance of duplication was a
moving away from competitive

01:10:39.717 --> 01:10:44.662
regulation.
I suspect that maybe quite an

01:10:44.662 --> 01:10:47.989
important idea.
T,N?

01:10:47.989 --> 01:10:51.862
Student: It is all very
well to say in a general way

01:10:51.862 --> 01:10:55.334
that it is good to avoid
duplication and to move away

01:10:55.334 --> 01:10:58.873
from competitive regulation
without going to where the

01:10:58.873 --> 01:11:01.276
trade-off lies in different
contexts.

01:11:01.276 --> 01:11:04.682
After all there is a lot of
experience to draw upon.

01:11:04.682 --> 01:11:06.818
For example U.S.,
India, the E.U.

01:11:06.818 --> 01:11:10.624
and many others have more than
one regulaory authority for

01:11:10.624 --> 01:11:14.630
different parts of the financial
sector sector while the U.K.

01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:17.501
has just one.
All the time the sector itself

01:11:17.501 --> 01:11:21.240
expanding with new agents,
poroducts etc entering all the

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.579
time, in part as a response to
the system in place.

01:11:24.579 --> 01:11:28.451
Based on your experience and
analytical skills where do you

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:34.920
come out on this issue?
Professor Larry Summers:

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:40.829
The question said--I'm going to
rephrase the question.

01:11:40.829 --> 01:11:42.774
The question was,
okay Larry that's good,

01:11:42.774 --> 01:11:45.060
but don't duck all the
interesting questions.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:47.229
There's a lot of experience in
a lot of places.

01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:49.280
In particular,
England has a single financial

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.024
regulator.
If you had to guess right now,

01:11:51.024 --> 01:11:57.303
what's the best way to do it?
Is that a fair rephrase of the

01:11:57.303 --> 01:12:05.043
question, T.N.?
I think that the three things I

01:12:05.043 --> 01:12:12.335
would emphasize are:
competitive regulation is

01:12:12.335 --> 01:12:20.600
probably a mistake if you
believe in regulation.

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:27.323
The central bank does need to
have a role in financial

01:12:27.323 --> 01:12:34.936
regulation of major institutions
because if it doesn't have a

01:12:34.936 --> 01:12:41.659
role in the regulation of
financial institutions,

01:12:41.659 --> 01:12:46.784
it's not going to know things
that it should know and it's

01:12:46.784 --> 01:12:51.010
going to end up living with the
consequences.

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:53.595
So, the central bank should be
crucially involved in the

01:12:53.595 --> 01:12:55.710
regulation of major financial
institutions.

01:12:55.710 --> 01:13:01.055
That--it's a--if you believe in
regulations that are pursuing

01:13:01.055 --> 01:13:05.777
objectives that are not
immediately in the interest of

01:13:05.777 --> 01:13:09.876
financial institutions--If you
believe in those

01:13:09.876 --> 01:13:13.439
regulations--consumer
regulations,

01:13:13.439 --> 01:13:17.525
community regulations and the
like--If you believe in those

01:13:17.525 --> 01:13:21.399
regulations and you want them
carried out with vigor,

01:13:21.399 --> 01:13:25.073
you need to give them to their
own regulator,

01:13:25.073 --> 01:13:30.000
who is not responsible for the
health of the institutions in

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:33.340
the way that the Federal Reserve
is.

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:37.193
Separation of consumer
regulation, elimination of

01:13:37.193 --> 01:13:40.887
competitive regulation,
and regulation of major

01:13:40.887 --> 01:13:45.543
financial institutions by an
entity--by a single entity--in

01:13:45.543 --> 01:13:49.638
which the central bank has a
role would be the three

01:13:49.638 --> 01:13:54.159
principles that I would suggest.
John?

01:13:54.159 --> 01:13:58.951
Student: I would like to
make a comment and ask two

01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:01.397
questions.
My comment is,

01:14:01.397 --> 01:14:06.738
like everyone I'm sure,
we all enjoyed your talk very

01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:08.591
much.
Professor Larry Summers:

01:14:08.591 --> 01:14:09.789
The comment is he enjoyed the
talk.

01:14:09.789 --> 01:14:13.763
That tends to--that's the kind
of thing you say before the

01:14:13.763 --> 01:14:17.946
devastating question and I knew
John when we were in graduate

01:14:17.946 --> 01:14:21.780
school together and nothing in
my four years of going to

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:25.823
graduate school with him makes
it less likely that after he

01:14:25.823 --> 01:14:28.076
said,
he really enjoyed the talk,

01:14:28.076 --> 01:14:30.520
that the devastating question
was going to come.

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.284
So I am braced.
Student: It took me five

01:14:33.284 --> 01:14:37.090
years of graduate school.
But anyway, your story of the

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:39.903
leverage cycle,
as I called it,

01:14:39.903 --> 01:14:45.531
where people leveraged too much
in good times and then in bad

01:14:45.531 --> 01:14:49.939
times just when you want them to
leverage,

01:14:49.939 --> 01:14:52.909
the leverage drops in the
system and there's not

01:14:52.909 --> 01:14:56.448
enough--there's too little
leverage to get you out of the

01:14:56.448 --> 01:15:00.089
doldrums.
I think it's a very important

01:15:00.089 --> 01:15:01.677
story.
So, that was my comment,

01:15:01.677 --> 01:15:03.907
but the question though is--
Professor Larry Summers:

01:15:03.907 --> 01:15:05.420
I thought at least I got the
comment,

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.860
which was that he really liked
the talk;

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:09.939
that didn't even count at all.
Okay go right ahead.

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:12.310
Student: The question
is, you don't seem to have

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:14.109
follow through to the end of the
story,

01:15:14.109 --> 01:15:17.342
which is that if you think that
the leverage is not being set by

01:15:17.342 --> 01:15:20.267
supply and demand properly--too
much in good times and not

01:15:20.267 --> 01:15:23.294
enough in bad times--then I
would have thought--maybe you're

01:15:23.294 --> 01:15:25.449
saving this for the question
period,

01:15:25.449 --> 01:15:28.655
so I'm giving you a chance to
say it--then you would think

01:15:28.655 --> 01:15:31.298
that regulators ought to
intervene to change the

01:15:31.298 --> 01:15:32.820
leverage.
So for example,

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.982
in good times they can prevent
people from leveraging so much

01:15:35.982 --> 01:15:39.197
and in bad times--it's a little
more difficult to see what you

01:15:39.197 --> 01:15:41.839
can do,
but particularly what I want

01:15:41.839 --> 01:15:45.786
you to talk about--how can the
Fed intervene in a way to

01:15:45.786 --> 01:15:48.608
increase the leverage?
For example,

01:15:48.608 --> 01:15:52.380
should it directly lend against
collateral.

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.268
But, they'll lend more money
against collateral than the

01:15:55.268 --> 01:15:57.894
market is willing to do,
not lend at lower interest

01:15:57.894 --> 01:16:00.135
rates.
But, just staying on your

01:16:00.135 --> 01:16:03.633
mortgage derivative,
which the market will only lend

01:16:03.633 --> 01:16:05.387
$50 on,
the Fed will take that as

01:16:05.387 --> 01:16:07.949
collateral, lend it the same
interest rate the market will,

01:16:07.949 --> 01:16:10.159
but lend $60 on it instead of
$50.

01:16:10.159 --> 01:16:11.715
Do you think the Fed should do
that and if it has been doing

01:16:11.715 --> 01:16:15.250
that?
That's the first question.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:18.924
The second question is,
you talked about the housing

01:16:18.924 --> 01:16:23.319
crisis and there's 50% of houses
and people may be [Inaudible]

01:16:23.319 --> 01:16:27.642
subprime borrowers--that's 2.5
million of them that have been

01:16:27.642 --> 01:16:31.658
tossed out of their houses.
You said at the same time that

01:16:31.658 --> 01:16:34.988
you think innovation sometimes
prolongs a problem and makes it

01:16:34.988 --> 01:16:37.282
worse.
But getting rid of this $180

01:16:37.282 --> 01:16:41.339
billion that you spoke of is not
going to make much of a dent in

01:16:41.339 --> 01:16:45.010
2.5 million families being
tossed out of their houses.

01:16:45.010 --> 01:16:47.044
So, do you think there should
be some more,

01:16:47.044 --> 01:16:49.515
bigger intervention?
One that I would suggest is the

01:16:49.515 --> 01:16:52.328
people doing the lending are the
ones who are going to lose all

01:16:52.328 --> 01:16:55.140
the money when these people are
thrown out of their houses.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:58.807
They're the ones with the
biggest interest to seeing

01:16:58.807 --> 01:17:01.839
something done.
They're paralyzed because the

01:17:01.839 --> 01:17:05.146
bondholders are split up so
completely that they can't

01:17:05.146 --> 01:17:07.761
coordinate.
They're remodifying the terms

01:17:07.761 --> 01:17:11.485
of the loan and no single banker
would let 2.5 million families

01:17:11.485 --> 01:17:15.208
be thrown out on the streets and
have their houses sold for 50%

01:17:15.208 --> 01:17:18.174
of the loan.
Can you think of a way of

01:17:18.174 --> 01:17:23.229
coordinating these people--these
lenders--who are uncoordinated,

01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:25.766
so that they themselves,
without the government having

01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:31.029
to put up any money,
can help solve the problem?

01:17:31.029 --> 01:17:36.030
Professor Larry Summers:
There are two characteristically

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:40.072
good questions.
On the first question,

01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:47.659
which was about pro-cyclical
leverage--as I tried to explain,

01:17:47.659 --> 01:17:52.194
I'm not sure the focus on
leverage is right rather than

01:17:52.194 --> 01:17:56.357
the focus being on lending.
Those are quite different

01:17:56.357 --> 01:18:00.057
things.
I actually think that the world

01:18:00.057 --> 01:18:03.617
is more risky;
the uncertainty surrounding

01:18:03.617 --> 01:18:07.767
what's going to happen to loans
is greater than it was a

01:18:07.767 --> 01:18:12.143
year--certainly than people
perceived it to be a year and a

01:18:12.143 --> 01:18:15.624
half ago.
So, I'm not sure institutions

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:20.976
should have much higher leverage
today than they did a year and a

01:18:20.976 --> 01:18:24.421
half ago.
That's why I put emphasis on

01:18:24.421 --> 01:18:29.099
what I think is the right thing.
I'm not sure they should have

01:18:29.099 --> 01:18:31.750
more leverage;
they should have more lending

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:35.488
and there's a way of getting to
more lending without having more

01:18:35.488 --> 01:18:38.039
leverage, which is raising more
capital.

01:18:38.039 --> 01:18:44.145
That's why I emphasized the
importance of pressuring

01:18:44.145 --> 01:18:50.369
institutions to raise more
capital and that's why,

01:18:50.369 --> 01:18:55.938
without having any terribly
compelling way to concretize it,

01:18:55.938 --> 01:19:01.600
I think in our thinking about
regulation we need to get a bit

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:07.358
away from the capital ratio as
the central variable since what

01:19:07.358 --> 01:19:15.229
we want is capital raising now,
not balance sheet shrinking.

01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:20.518
An emphasis on the capital
ratio treats those two as

01:19:20.518 --> 01:19:25.600
equivalent when they're not in
fact equivalent.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:30.666
The one suggestion that has
been made, and I have no idea

01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:35.010
whether it actually works out in
a viable way,

01:19:35.010 --> 01:19:43.108
is to force institutions to
issue some kind of security that

01:19:43.108 --> 01:19:51.480
is a reverse convertible that
becomes--that converts from debt

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:58.220
to equity in difficult times.
It's hard to see why that

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:03.791
security is going to feel a lot
like debt when you buy it in the

01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:06.406
good times,
so I'm not sure whether that

01:20:06.406 --> 01:20:09.357
works out, but that's the type
of thing that one has to think

01:20:09.357 --> 01:20:14.154
about.
I would resist the idea of

01:20:14.154 --> 01:20:22.359
framing the question through the
leverage ratio.

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:30.426
Should the government try in
good times to require levels of

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:38.492
capital or limits on leverage
that go beyond what appears to

01:20:38.492 --> 01:20:46.011
be prudential for individual
institutions in the name of

01:20:46.011 --> 01:20:53.389
protection of the system?
I'm probably one big financial

01:20:53.389 --> 01:20:57.470
mess away from being in favor of
that.

01:20:57.470 --> 01:21:03.976
Not quite there because I think
you've got to be very careful

01:21:03.976 --> 01:21:10.699
about the adverse effects if you
don't do it very carefully.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.646
Once you're talking about a
punitive capital requirement

01:21:13.646 --> 01:21:16.859
that's not related to your
institution's prudential needs,

01:21:16.859 --> 01:21:19.560
the incentive to avoid it is
very strong.

01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.664
So, if you don't do it for
every institution,

01:21:22.664 --> 01:21:26.757
the action is going to migrate
away and if you do do it for

01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:30.725
every institution,
you're getting to a pretty

01:21:30.725 --> 01:21:34.626
dirigiste place,
in which the government is

01:21:34.626 --> 01:21:40.293
regulating in a lot of places
where it's probably not going to

01:21:40.293 --> 01:21:45.343
be so good at regulating.
Your other question was about

01:21:45.343 --> 01:21:48.310
the foreclosure and mortgage
problem.

01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:52.525
I think one of the easiest
judgments to make,

01:21:52.525 --> 01:21:57.794
in the sense that there's a
measure available that has a

01:21:57.794 --> 01:22:02.010
reasonable chance of doing good
and has,

01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:07.634
I think, roughly no chance of
doing bad, is the legislation

01:22:07.634 --> 01:22:13.064
that's been introduced by
Senator McCaskill and others to

01:22:13.064 --> 01:22:18.785
remove legal liability from
servicers for any decisions they

01:22:18.785 --> 01:22:24.699
make to renegotiate the total
value of these mortgages.

01:22:24.699 --> 01:22:27.579
I think there's considerable
doubt as to how much

01:22:27.579 --> 01:22:31.180
activity--how much positive
activity--that would generate,

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:38.010
but there's no downside and
potentially some upside.

01:22:38.010 --> 01:22:42.079
There's also another
interesting problem in this

01:22:42.079 --> 01:22:45.630
area, which is many subprime
mortgages,

01:22:45.630 --> 01:22:51.026
probably more than a third,
have second liens against them

01:22:51.026 --> 01:22:55.949
that are serviced by somebody
other than the original

01:22:55.949 --> 01:22:59.483
originator.
Anybody's good plan for working

01:22:59.483 --> 01:23:03.504
these things through where you
reduce the value of the house

01:23:03.504 --> 01:23:06.435
is, in effect,
going to wipe out that second

01:23:06.435 --> 01:23:09.426
mortgage.
But, it is going to require the

01:23:09.426 --> 01:23:13.565
consent of that second mortgage
and that second mortgage doesn't

01:23:13.565 --> 01:23:16.850
have any very strong incentive
to give consent.

01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:22.721
There's a long and dubiously
honorable financial tradition of

01:23:22.721 --> 01:23:28.166
being paid to be a holdout.
How one handles that is a

01:23:28.166 --> 01:23:33.379
potentially serious problem,
not least because it's

01:23:33.379 --> 01:23:39.010
financially and economically
advantageous to do so.

01:23:39.010 --> 01:23:43.420
People who are good at being
holdouts are likely to acquire a

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:47.389
substantial number of these
second mortgages and so the

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:52.020
holdout rights will be exercised
more skillfully than they would

01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:58.243
be by their current holders.
I guess my reaction is--to your

01:23:58.243 --> 01:24:04.010
question is--can the capital
markets handle it?

01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:08.468
Yes, at a price and the price
will be that de facto in

01:24:08.468 --> 01:24:12.432
this environment.
The demand curve for equity

01:24:12.432 --> 01:24:16.781
slopes downward,
so if a lot of equity needs to

01:24:16.781 --> 01:24:21.705
be raised,
the price will be lower than if

01:24:21.705 --> 01:24:27.069
a small amount of equity needs
to be raised.

01:24:27.069 --> 01:24:33.823
So, shareowners of these
institutions are not wrong to be

01:24:33.823 --> 01:24:41.060
hoping to reduce the amount of
capital they have to raise.

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:48.287
That is rational behavior on
their part, but it may not be

01:24:48.287 --> 01:24:54.500
desirable from the point of view
of the system.

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:56.060
Student: Then the
question would be,

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.251
I guess, where would they have
to take capital from in order

01:24:58.251 --> 01:25:01.597
for lenders to do something?
Professor Larry Summers:

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:05.355
I don't think we have a--I
think, with the trillions of

01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:09.391
dollars sitting in sovereign
wealth funds with a very large

01:25:09.391 --> 01:25:13.079
volume of assets that are held
by pension funds,

01:25:13.079 --> 01:25:17.276
and endowments,
and life insurance companies,

01:25:17.276 --> 01:25:22.902
I don't think one needs to fear
that if $200 billion more in

01:25:22.902 --> 01:25:27.986
capital was infused into U.S.
financial institutions that

01:25:27.986 --> 01:25:31.715
somehow there would be a
generalized--relative prices

01:25:31.715 --> 01:25:36.813
would adjust in various ways.
But, I think the least of the

01:25:36.813 --> 01:25:42.130
concerns is that somehow we'd
have a general shortage of

01:25:42.130 --> 01:25:48.108
capital for other purposes.
I think there is a--this is a

01:25:48.108 --> 01:25:52.780
tricky subject,
in the sense that everybody's

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:57.286
got the same idea,
which is that they want to be

01:25:57.286 --> 01:26:01.918
the last dollar of equity in
because you want to be in after

01:26:01.918 --> 01:26:06.079
the dilutions rather than in
before the dilutions.

01:26:06.079 --> 01:26:11.400
So, there's the concern that,
when you speak of large needs

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:17.178
for capital, that the incentive
to be a partial solution may not

01:26:17.178 --> 01:26:20.160
be that great.
On the other hand,

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.226
the strategy of sort of
deception--we only need a little

01:26:24.226 --> 01:26:28.883
and then we'll be done--also is
probably not a strategy that can

01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:33.539
be carried on very successfully
for a long period of time.

01:26:33.539 --> 01:26:37.704
That's why somewhat more
comprehensive,

01:26:37.704 --> 01:26:43.293
somewhat larger approaches to
capital raising would,

01:26:43.293 --> 01:26:46.910
it seems to me,
be desirable.

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:50.065
Gus?
Student: You were

01:26:50.065 --> 01:26:54.961
mentioning that additions to the
agreed short-term stimulus

01:26:54.961 --> 01:26:59.772
package might be warranted.
What would you include in such

01:26:59.772 --> 01:27:04.803
a second package?
Professor Larry Summers:

01:27:04.803 --> 01:27:10.331
I suspect there should be a
contingency plan that is in

01:27:10.331 --> 01:27:15.859
place to give more rebates
during the tax filing season

01:27:15.859 --> 01:27:22.103
next spring that somebody can
decide to pull the trigger on or

01:27:22.103 --> 01:27:27.120
not to pull the trigger on late
next fall,

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:31.603
as we see where the economy is.
There should be some

01:27:31.603 --> 01:27:37.914
supplementation of unemployment
insurance and food stamps and

01:27:37.914 --> 01:27:43.278
there should be--almost
certainly be--some effort to

01:27:43.278 --> 01:27:49.800
reduce the pro-cyclicality of
the state and local sector,

01:27:49.800 --> 01:27:53.570
which because of balanced
budgets and less tax

01:27:53.570 --> 01:27:58.180
collections, spending of all
kinds is being cut back.

01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:01.787
I say "almost certainly"
because there is a bit of a

01:28:01.787 --> 01:28:06.243
problem in the history of fiscal
federalism in the United States

01:28:06.243 --> 01:28:11.214
in that whenever times are good,
governors cut taxes and

01:28:11.214 --> 01:28:16.908
whenever times are bad,
the federal government provides

01:28:16.908 --> 01:28:21.020
support to respond to the
emergency.

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:24.650
That's not a terribly healthy
set of arrangements and there

01:28:24.650 --> 01:28:28.029
was a lot of tax cutting going
on in the good times.

01:28:28.029 --> 01:28:30.343
But on balance,
I think there are a variety of

01:28:30.343 --> 01:28:32.605
mechanisms, including Medicaid
reimbursement,

01:28:32.605 --> 01:28:34.795
for doing it;
but, doing something for state

01:28:34.795 --> 01:28:37.119
and local governments would be
the other piece I would

01:28:37.119 --> 01:28:38.859
emphasize.
Yeah?

01:28:38.859 --> 01:28:42.888
Student: What do you
think is the main cause of the

01:28:42.888 --> 01:28:54.130
housing crisis?
Why did it happen?

01:28:54.130 --> 01:29:00.067
Professor Larry Summers:
I think most of positive

01:29:00.067 --> 01:29:05.788
feedback mechanisms that I
talked about yesterday were

01:29:05.788 --> 01:29:11.833
operative both going up and
going down in the housing and

01:29:11.833 --> 01:29:17.315
mortgage security market.
It's not that you can't

01:29:17.315 --> 01:29:21.029
understand why people made these
loans.

01:29:21.029 --> 01:29:25.960
The truth is that in the period
from the late 1990s through

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:31.229
2006, no matter how crummy the
person--no matter how crummy the

01:29:31.229 --> 01:29:34.970
credit of the person--you lent
money to,

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:39.983
you did not get defaulted on.
The reason was that if he

01:29:39.983 --> 01:29:43.967
bought a house,
the house went up in value and

01:29:43.967 --> 01:29:48.039
he was able to borrow more to
pay you back.

01:29:48.039 --> 01:29:51.885
So, the lesson that was learned
was that lending money to

01:29:51.885 --> 01:29:55.936
people, even people who didn't
look like they'd be very good

01:29:55.936 --> 01:30:01.010
credits,
was a safe thing to do.

01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:03.867
Now, ex post,
we can see what the error in

01:30:03.867 --> 01:30:07.140
the inference was--that it
presumed the continued strong

01:30:07.140 --> 01:30:11.010
behavior of house prices--but
that wasn't completely obvious.

01:30:11.010 --> 01:30:15.570
That was less completely
obvious at the time and then you

01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:19.716
had various other things.
People made the investments and

01:30:19.716 --> 01:30:22.353
they--if you were in the
mortgage business,

01:30:22.353 --> 01:30:25.310
you bought mortgages;
you succeeded;

01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:28.880
your mortgages went up in value
as risk premiums went down.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.204
Then, you had more capital;
you got paid on the basis of

01:30:32.204 --> 01:30:35.899
how much you invested.
With more capital,

01:30:35.899 --> 01:30:40.484
you decided to invest more.
So, you had all the kind of

01:30:40.484 --> 01:30:43.869
positive feedback mechanisms I
described on the upside and then

01:30:43.869 --> 01:30:47.199
you more or less had all those
mechanisms on the downside.

01:30:47.199 --> 01:31:19.510
Student: But isn't that
an issue for regulators?

01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:23.605
Professor Larry Summers:
Those of an anti--those of a

01:31:23.605 --> 01:31:28.367
very strong, if you like,
Chicago School bent make the

01:31:28.367 --> 01:31:33.729
point, so let's see who did well
in this situation;

01:31:33.729 --> 01:31:35.593
let's see who did badly,
let's see who did reasonably

01:31:35.593 --> 01:31:37.666
well in this situation.
Hedge funds--nobody much

01:31:37.666 --> 01:31:41.989
regulates them;
they seem to have done okay.

01:31:41.989 --> 01:31:46.048
Individuals--some of them got
to--some of them got in trouble

01:31:46.048 --> 01:31:49.565
but some of them got loans on
terms that weren't very

01:31:49.565 --> 01:31:51.740
attractive;
that wasn't so bad.

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:56.337
Who really made a huge mess?
Well, the big money center

01:31:56.337 --> 01:31:58.836
banks made a huge mess.
Who's most extensively

01:31:58.836 --> 01:32:00.750
regulated?
Well, the big money center

01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:02.649
banks are most extensively
regulated.

01:32:02.649 --> 01:32:07.495
I get it; we need more
regulation--is this sort of

01:32:07.495 --> 01:32:13.625
Chicago argument and it should
give one--I don't think it's the

01:32:13.625 --> 01:32:18.654
end of the subject.
I think, it probably doesn't

01:32:18.654 --> 01:32:23.572
point in the right direction at
the end of the day,

01:32:23.572 --> 01:32:27.899
but it's not a point to be
taken lightly.

01:32:27.899 --> 01:32:32.094
Since I like the spirit of your
observation, here's another

01:32:32.094 --> 01:32:34.770
observation in the spirit of
yours.

01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:38.130
So, all these banks lost a lot
of money;

01:32:38.130 --> 01:32:43.575
who made money?
Well, a ton of the gain that is

01:32:43.575 --> 01:32:49.639
opposite the banks loss is a
bunch of relatively poor people

01:32:49.639 --> 01:32:55.085
who sold their houses for
substantially more than they

01:32:55.085 --> 01:33:00.635
otherwise would have because of
the bad credit that the

01:33:00.635 --> 01:33:05.260
financial sector was prepared to
give.

01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:10.238
I think the thing you have to
say is that there are a fair

01:33:10.238 --> 01:33:15.740
number of people who are having
to explain to their children why

01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:21.068
a policeman is knocking at the
door and telling them they have

01:33:21.068 --> 01:33:25.784
to leave within six hours
because they signed documents

01:33:25.784 --> 01:33:30.675
that they didn't understand and
that weren't explained to

01:33:30.675 --> 01:33:36.090
them--that locked them into an
arrangement that was,

01:33:36.090 --> 01:33:40.010
for them, going to be highly
problematic.

01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:43.069
You can call it predatory
borrowing and you can explain

01:33:43.069 --> 01:33:46.073
how they lived in a house,
in a sense, rent-free for a

01:33:46.073 --> 01:33:51.356
significant period of time;
but, I think it would be

01:33:51.356 --> 01:33:59.289
mistake to discount the trauma
that has been imposed.

01:33:59.289 --> 01:34:03.632
But, there is a sense in which
more regulated entities have

01:34:03.632 --> 01:34:07.526
performed worse and suffered
more than less regulated

01:34:07.526 --> 01:34:10.069
entities.
Last question?

01:34:10.069 --> 01:35:03.331
Student: How does our
current crisis compare with

01:35:03.331 --> 01:35:31.225
Japan's since the 1990s?
Professor Larry Summers:

01:35:31.225 --> 01:35:35.954
Look, I think there are
structural similarities between

01:35:35.954 --> 01:35:40.195
our problem and Japan's problem.
I think there are a variety of

01:35:40.195 --> 01:35:42.547
reasons to think that the bubble
was substantially greater in

01:35:42.547 --> 01:35:45.517
Japan.
I think, if one compares U.S.

01:35:45.517 --> 01:35:50.753
policy in the last nine months
with Japanese policy between

01:35:50.753 --> 01:35:53.641
1989 and 1992,
we are acting with

01:35:53.641 --> 01:35:57.974
substantially more
aggressiveness to get in front

01:35:57.974 --> 01:36:00.365
of the problem.
U.S.

01:36:00.365 --> 01:36:06.245
regulators, fortunately from my
perspective, have been very

01:36:06.245 --> 01:36:11.010
resistant to what was a major
Japanese idea,

01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:14.790
which was mark assets in ways
that will--that it is thought

01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:18.831
will--contribute to confidence
rather than in ways that reflect

01:36:18.831 --> 01:36:22.236
market realities.
I think that the rather

01:36:22.236 --> 01:36:27.106
arbitrary accounting that was
pursued as a major tool of

01:36:27.106 --> 01:36:31.533
policy in Japan inhibited a
great deal of necessary

01:36:31.533 --> 01:36:36.017
adjustment.
That said, while I think the

01:36:36.017 --> 01:36:41.386
probability is low,
one can't rule out the kind of

01:36:41.386 --> 01:36:45.439
situation that developed in
Japan.

01:36:45.439 --> 01:36:51.696
I think we do--I think these
issues of levels of capital in

01:36:51.696 --> 01:36:58.060
troubled financial institution
are very important issues.

01:36:58.060 --> 01:37:06.010
One way of responding to an
externality is with a subsidy.

01:37:06.010 --> 01:37:09.756
The idea of subsidizing
institutions to raise capital

01:37:09.756 --> 01:37:13.791
seems quite untenable in the
context of the institution's

01:37:13.791 --> 01:37:16.890
shareholders holding onto their
shares.

01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:20.347
So in a way,
we operate a system where the

01:37:20.347 --> 01:37:25.406
government can't infuse capital
into an institution until the

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:29.849
situation is very far gone,
but once the situation is very

01:37:29.849 --> 01:37:33.324
far gone, it is very far gone.
I don't think it's

01:37:33.324 --> 01:37:37.900
inconceivable that the
government will have to infuse

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:43.269
capital into institutions on a
significant scale in the course

01:37:43.269 --> 01:37:47.574
of this crisis;
but, I don't think we're ready

01:37:47.574 --> 01:37:52.409
yet to start planning for Nordic
style or Mexican style,

01:37:52.409 --> 01:37:58.693
or Japanese style socialization
of the financial system,

01:37:58.693 --> 01:38:05.319
though I wouldn't--I think that
probability is very low.

01:38:05.319 --> 01:38:10.291
I wouldn't preclude that as a
possibility and I think,

01:38:10.291 --> 01:38:14.418
in retrospect,
it came significantly later in

01:38:14.418 --> 01:38:17.326
Japan than would,
in retrospect,

01:38:17.326 --> 01:38:21.000
have been ideal.
Thank you very much.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.307
Professor Robert Shiller:
I thought I would just

00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:11.015
remember a couple of highlights
from the first two lectures to

00:00:11.015 --> 00:00:15.483
consolidate what we said then.
In the first lecture,

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:20.836
I talked about a lot of things,
but one theme that comes to my

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:25.751
mind is the theme of the moral
purpose and mission of the

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:30.318
finance community.
We talked about the sense that,

00:00:30.318 --> 00:00:35.005
I think, young people have a
sort of prejudice against the

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:39.527
field and they think that
finance is a field that you go

00:00:39.527 --> 00:00:44.050
into if you really value money
rather than people.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.444
I want to reiterate again that
that's not the way I view the

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:54.648
field at all.
I was just yesterday--I gave a

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:59.290
talk in Montreal at the Caisse
de Dépôt,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.838
et Placement du Québec,
which is the big wealth

00:01:03.838 --> 00:01:07.700
management fund for the Province
of Quebec.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.083
I met a lot of people there and
I never once got the idea that

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:14.670
anyone there was evil or
grasping.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.855
I think they have a moral
purpose, which is to preserve

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:23.349
the livelihoods of the people of
the Province of Quebec.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:27.855
You get a very different view
of things when you meet the

00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:30.626
people.
I think our entertainment

00:01:30.626 --> 00:01:35.129
industry likes to make movies
about people in finance,

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:39.502
but they are inevitably
portrayed as evil and I don't

00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:43.747
know why that is.
I don't think there has ever

00:01:43.747 --> 00:01:48.947
been a major motion picture
about a financial person who

00:01:48.947 --> 00:01:54.450
ended up a philanthropist.
Why is that?

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.731
I just don't--people don't
like--people would rather

00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:01.527
hate--I don't know why it's
something--it wouldn't be a good

00:02:01.527 --> 00:02:05.003
movie theme, would it?
Anyway, you have to overcome

00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:09.062
these--you have to think that if
you go into the field you would

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:12.218
probably--If you're
successful--you would probably

00:02:12.218 --> 00:02:16.664
end up as a philanthropist;
but no movie will be made about

00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:21.050
your life and you may encounter
hostility the whole way.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.099
It's especially true right now
with the subprime crisis.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.295
People are blaming the
financial community for our

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:31.755
troubles now.
It is true that we're seeing

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:36.030
some people thrown out of their
houses, in some cases,

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.448
because of some rather
questionable financial practices

00:02:39.448 --> 00:02:43.310
that got people into mortgages
that they shouldn't have gotten

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.049
into.
But overall,

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.410
I think that the people in this
field are good people.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.780
In the last lecture,
I talked aboutâ€“In the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.936
second lecture,
I talked about the pooling of

00:02:56.936 --> 00:03:00.953
risks and the basic theme of
that lecture was that we now

00:03:00.953 --> 00:03:04.830
have a mathematical theory,
probability theory.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.505
When you look at this theory,
you realize that it suggests a

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:14.340
very important technology for
improving human welfare and that

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.644
is: by spreading risks.
The economy,

00:03:17.644 --> 00:03:20.652
and technology,
and the weather,

00:03:20.652 --> 00:03:24.629
and all sorts of factors create
risks.

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.985
But, the real technology
is--the technology that works to

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:33.810
eliminate risks is to spread
them out,

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.611
to pool them,
to share them among many

00:03:36.611 --> 00:03:40.836
different people.
So, the idea that theorists

00:03:40.836 --> 00:03:45.997
suggest--and it may be
unreachable--but the perfect

00:03:45.997 --> 00:03:52.810
financial system would have all
of our risks pooled completely.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.990
That is, nobody suffers alone.
If anything happens to me in my

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.444
livelihood, then it's spread out
over everybody and everybody

00:04:02.444 --> 00:04:06.584
means the whole world.
Whatever happens to me,

00:04:06.584 --> 00:04:11.452
when it's spread out over six
billion plus people,

00:04:11.452 --> 00:04:16.121
it ends up divided by six
billion and it becomes

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:19.986
unobservable.
It becomes so small that it's

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:22.420
meaningless and that's the
ideal.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.177
That's what,
in principle,

00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:28.256
we can do and what I think is
the most important concept in

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:31.209
finance--this concept of risk
pooling.

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:34.459
We live in a world where people
suffer all kinds of misfortunes.

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:36.860
Of course, we can try to get
rid of these misfortunes.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.257
We can do research on disease
prevention and weather

00:04:41.257 --> 00:04:46.372
modification and global warming.
We can do research on all these

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:50.384
things, but there's another
technology, which is extremely

00:04:50.384 --> 00:04:53.346
important.
That is, even leaving the risks

00:04:53.346 --> 00:04:56.120
as they are and just sharing
them better.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.300
So, I'll be talking more about
this.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.801
The problem is that while the
principle of risk-sharing is

00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:09.459
very simple and obvious the
practice requires technology.

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:12.885
It's just like you could say
some of the principles of

00:05:12.885 --> 00:05:16.680
mechanics are very obvious,
but to make an engine that

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.670
operates in terms of those
principles is not obvious.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:27.288
What I want to talk today about
is what I call technology in

00:05:27.288 --> 00:05:30.739
finance.
I'll present my view of the

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:35.829
situation, but maybe it's a
rather idiosyncratic view that I

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:39.207
have.
But, I think--It's not so much

00:05:39.207 --> 00:05:43.058
idiosyncratic,
but it's a different emphasis

00:05:43.058 --> 00:05:47.108
that I put forth.
What I want to talkâ€“There

00:05:47.108 --> 00:05:50.167
are really three themes to
today's lecture:

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.280
a risk theme,
a framing theme,

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.712
and an invention theme.
I want to go over the history

00:05:56.712 --> 00:06:00.920
of risk management and through
these three themes.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.052
The first one is,
I might say,

00:06:03.052 --> 00:06:06.694
a long-term risk theme.
Let me go over these three

00:06:06.694 --> 00:06:07.250
themes.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.769
The long-term risks are
dominant in our lives.

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:32.605
By that, I mean that everyone's
life is a sequence of shocks

00:06:32.605 --> 00:06:37.810
that accumulate over your life.
I'm talking about economic

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.856
shocks.
When you start out young--We're

00:06:40.856 --> 00:06:43.941
unequal at birth,
of course, because of our

00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:48.348
parents and the advantages we
have, but relatively equal at a

00:06:48.348 --> 00:06:50.997
young age.
As each year goes by,

00:06:50.997 --> 00:06:55.420
you accumulate economic shocks,
shocks to your human capital,

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.589
shocks to what you own as you
get older.

00:06:58.589 --> 00:07:03.347
You start--Your human capital
is your ability to do things and

00:07:03.347 --> 00:07:06.856
your knowledge,
which is what you have to sell

00:07:06.856 --> 00:07:10.139
in the marketplace.
As you get older,

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.482
your human capital evolves and
it has its ups and downs as you

00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:21.001
age and you start switching from
human capital to other forms of

00:07:21.001 --> 00:07:23.121
capital.
In other words,

00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:26.067
you start saving and you own
stocks and bonds,

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:28.490
and real estate,
and other things.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.667
Each of these suffers a
sequence of shocks that cumulate

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:36.237
over your lifetime,
so inequality gets worse and

00:07:36.237 --> 00:07:40.045
worse as people age.
It is at its worst after

00:07:40.045 --> 00:07:44.595
retirement when you are no
longer--you've exhausted your

00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:49.310
human capital and you're living
off of all the accumulated

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.399
physical capital.
That's the life cycle story.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:59.188
There's great inequality among
the elderly and that's a

00:07:59.188 --> 00:08:02.820
problem.
Some of them are living very

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.210
badly and others are living with
great comfort.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.990
That's what finance is about.
It's really about people.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.723
We don't care at all about
corporations--we should make

00:08:15.723 --> 00:08:19.180
that clear--except as they
contribute to individual

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.183
welfare.
I don't care what happens to

00:08:22.183 --> 00:08:25.830
Citigroup or IBM,
except for the fact that there

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.022
are all those stockholders out
there and they're of all

00:08:30.022 --> 00:08:33.625
different situations.
Some of them are absolutely

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:36.210
dependent on their holding of
these stocks.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:39.525
That's what we have to think
about and it's a long-term

00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:43.255
problem.
The problem with long-term

00:08:43.255 --> 00:08:50.085
risks, also, is that anything
that we do to mitigate these

00:08:50.085 --> 00:08:55.098
risks creates moral hazard.
That's another fundamental

00:08:55.098 --> 00:08:57.139
theme of finance.
What is moral hazard?

00:08:57.139 --> 00:09:00.654
That's a term that first
entered the English language

00:09:00.654 --> 00:09:04.440
sometime in the mid-nineteenth
century, but of course the

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.706
concept goes earlier.
Moral hazard occurs when a risk

00:09:08.706 --> 00:09:12.694
management institution
incentivizes you to do bad

00:09:12.694 --> 00:09:17.674
behavior--to show bad behavior.
The classic example of moral

00:09:17.674 --> 00:09:21.939
hazard is with fire insurance.
I get fire insurance on my

00:09:21.939 --> 00:09:26.059
house and so I behave badly:
I deliberately burn the house

00:09:26.059 --> 00:09:29.710
down to collect on my insurance.
That's moral hazard;

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.110
but it's not unique to that,
it's all over the place.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.059
When you manage risks,
you create moral hazard.

00:09:36.059 --> 00:09:40.502
That's why we need invention
and theory in finance to

00:09:40.502 --> 00:09:45.031
minimize that.
The second theme for this

00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:48.320
lecture is about framing.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.107
By that I mean psychological
framing, and there are many

00:09:56.107 --> 00:10:00.161
psychologists who talk about
this, but notably Daniel

00:10:00.161 --> 00:10:02.500
Kahneman and Amos Tversky.

00:10:05.769 --> 00:10:11.838
"Psychological framing" means
the tendency for people to view

00:10:11.838 --> 00:10:16.794
things in a distorted way
depending on how they're

00:10:16.794 --> 00:10:19.716
presented.
If I present things in one

00:10:19.716 --> 00:10:21.860
frame, then you would react one
way.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.137
If I present the same thing in
another context or background or

00:10:26.137 --> 00:10:29.379
environment, then you react very
differently.

00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:33.820
I will expand on this in a
minute.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:42.580
The third theme is the
invention theme of this lecture.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.691
That is--I mentioned this
before, but I want to expand on

00:10:47.691 --> 00:10:52.529
it in this lecture--that the
history of finance is the

00:10:52.529 --> 00:10:58.280
history of invention just as
much as it is in other fields,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:03.795
notably engineering.
The idea that I want to develop

00:11:03.795 --> 00:11:08.055
is that the history of finance
is a history of discrete

00:11:08.055 --> 00:11:11.333
inventions.
Non-obvious ideas were

00:11:11.333 --> 00:11:17.063
conceived of to solve these
problems of long-term risks and

00:11:17.063 --> 00:11:22.794
to get around the psychological
barriers imposed by framing

00:11:22.794 --> 00:11:27.812
biases and psychological biases,
in order to allow people to

00:11:27.812 --> 00:11:30.690
actually manage the risk and to
get around moral hazard.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:34.657
It's a difficult thing to do
these things and that's why we

00:11:34.657 --> 00:11:37.722
need invention.
Another thing is that,

00:11:37.722 --> 00:11:42.996
when once an invention is made,
it tends to be copied all over

00:11:42.996 --> 00:11:45.968
the world.
So, the history of finance is

00:11:45.968 --> 00:11:50.070
largely a history of copying.
That's what you have to do.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.737
You may have to adapt it to a
particular environment,

00:11:53.737 --> 00:11:56.700
but basically it is copying
other ideas.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.703
Some people in less-developed
countries feel uncomfortable

00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:03.653
that they are just slavishly
copying other,

00:12:03.653 --> 00:12:07.538
more advanced countries;
but, they have to recognize

00:12:07.538 --> 00:12:11.019
that is what everybody has been
doing all along.

00:12:11.019 --> 00:12:14.534
We copy the good ideas and in
the process we adjust them and

00:12:14.534 --> 00:12:18.391
make them a little bit better.
New ideas can come from

00:12:18.391 --> 00:12:20.251
anywhere.
The basic thing,

00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:23.920
though, is that every country
has to take the insights that

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.450
have been developed around the
world.

00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:35.789
Let me come back now--I want to
go through these three themes.

00:12:35.789 --> 00:12:40.799
Let me start with the long-term
risk theme.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:48.928
I want to start with an
article, which--mention an

00:12:48.928 --> 00:12:53.740
article by Backus,
Kydland,

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.013
and Kehoe--actually Backus,
Kehoe, and Kydland,

00:12:56.013 --> 00:12:58.187
three economists [David K.
Backus, Patrick J.

00:12:58.187 --> 00:13:00.412
Kehoe and Finn E.
Kydland, "International Real

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:03.031
Business Cycles," Journal of
Political Economy,

00:13:03.031 --> 00:13:04.860
100(4):745-775,
August 1992].

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.289
One of these,
the last of the three,

00:13:07.289 --> 00:13:10.344
Finn Kydland,
won the Nobel Prize a few years

00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:12.272
ago.
In this article,

00:13:12.272 --> 00:13:16.304
they talked about the
correlation of consumption

00:13:16.304 --> 00:13:18.020
around the world.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.325
What is consumption?
It's the amount that people

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:31.408
spend on consumption goods,
things that you buy for your

00:13:31.408 --> 00:13:35.198
current use, like food,
shelter, clothing,

00:13:35.198 --> 00:13:38.454
etc.
Every country computes an

00:13:38.454 --> 00:13:44.272
estimate of how much is spent
each year on consumption by the

00:13:44.272 --> 00:13:48.528
people who live in the country.
What Backus,

00:13:48.528 --> 00:13:53.160
Kehoe, and Kydland did was look
at how much the consumption

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.872
correlates--the movement from
year to year--correlate across

00:13:57.872 --> 00:14:00.275
countries.
If there were perfect

00:14:00.275 --> 00:14:03.259
correlation, then it would be a
correlation of one.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.486
That is, when one country's
consumption increases from one

00:14:06.486 --> 00:14:08.636
year to the next,
every other country's

00:14:08.636 --> 00:14:11.580
consumption increases from one
year to the next.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.992
What they argued in this paper
was that, if we had perfect risk

00:14:15.992 --> 00:14:19.764
management, then there would be
perfect correlation of

00:14:19.764 --> 00:14:23.749
consumption across countries
because if we get rid of the

00:14:23.749 --> 00:14:27.664
idiosyncratic risks,
then all that's left is

00:14:27.664 --> 00:14:30.934
planet-wide risks.
If we had perfect financial

00:14:30.934 --> 00:14:33.889
markets--and this is
intuitive--and I don't know how

00:14:33.889 --> 00:14:36.923
obvious this is,
it's obvious to me,

00:14:36.923 --> 00:14:43.031
but it's an intuitive point of
great importance--nobody would

00:14:43.031 --> 00:14:46.398
suffer alone.
Anytime there's a risk that

00:14:46.398 --> 00:14:50.068
hits one person or one country
the financial markets would

00:14:50.068 --> 00:14:53.610
spread it out over everybody and
it gets very small.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.813
What's left?
The only risks that are left

00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:01.436
are risks that everyone shares,
so you would see planet-wide

00:15:01.436 --> 00:15:05.040
risks expressing themselves in
consumption,

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.180
but nothing else.
Do you see that point?

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:11.131
We'd have perfect correlation.
Suppose the planet were hit by

00:15:11.131 --> 00:15:14.101
a comet--this
happened--something like this

00:15:14.101 --> 00:15:18.062
happened sixty-five million
years ago, so it could happen

00:15:18.062 --> 00:15:20.352
again.
Maybe it won't now that we have

00:15:20.352 --> 00:15:23.231
better plans to prevent things
like that, but suppose it did

00:15:23.231 --> 00:15:27.968
happen.
We would see huge damage on the

00:15:27.968 --> 00:15:31.105
impact site.
Let's neglect the fact that

00:15:31.105 --> 00:15:34.166
some people would be killed by
the impact, suppose it was just

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:37.279
economic damage.
It would be a terrible--it

00:15:37.279 --> 00:15:42.347
would be a problem all over the
world because the damage would

00:15:42.347 --> 00:15:45.922
extend around the world;
but, you'd be much better off

00:15:45.922 --> 00:15:48.769
if you were on the other side of
the world, not where it hit.

00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:51.650
If we didn't have financial
arrangements,

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.115
then the people near the impact
would be in a terrible economic

00:15:56.115 --> 00:16:00.579
situation and the people on the
other side would be much better

00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:02.741
off.
If we had the proper risk

00:16:02.741 --> 00:16:05.625
management institutions in
place, people would have

00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:08.798
anticipated this risk and would
have made swaps or other

00:16:08.798 --> 00:16:11.740
arrangements to protect
themselves against it.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:15.038
What would happen?
The people near the impact

00:16:15.038 --> 00:16:18.580
would not be harmed any more
than anyone else.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:22.450
The world would suffer because
the damage is substantial and it

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.902
reduces our ability to produce.
So, the whole world--everyone's

00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:27.880
consumption around the world
would go down.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.083
You can't prevent that.
Anything that hits the whole

00:16:31.083 --> 00:16:33.680
planet would be affected.
Backus, Kydland,

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.069
and Kehoe thought that that's
the situation we should be in

00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:40.468
today.
There are things hitting the

00:16:40.468 --> 00:16:44.334
whole world, like global warming
for example, and there are many

00:16:44.334 --> 00:16:49.250
of them.
How well are we doing?

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:51.360
We're not doing well at all,
they concluded.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.548
The correlation across
countries in consumption changes

00:16:54.548 --> 00:16:57.187
is low.
In fact, it's lower than the

00:16:57.187 --> 00:17:01.100
correlation of income changes,
which is surprising.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:05.103
It means we really haven't done
anything--that's an

00:17:05.103 --> 00:17:09.587
exaggeration--we've done very
little to manage risks that

00:17:09.587 --> 00:17:12.710
individuals or that countries
face,

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.019
for that matter,
or even individuals face.

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:18.351
We've done a lot--I shouldn't
say we haven't done

00:17:18.351 --> 00:17:20.920
anything--but we can do a lot
more.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:25.076
The idea of risk,
that economic risks can be

00:17:25.076 --> 00:17:30.296
pooled, is an intuitive one that
has occurred to people

00:17:30.296 --> 00:17:34.289
throughout history.
It's very simple and obvious.

00:17:34.289 --> 00:17:38.576
If we're living in--imagine
we're living in some remote area

00:17:38.576 --> 00:17:42.790
and we're pioneers out there
with our cabins and there's no

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.970
government.
There's no one to protect us.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.581
What do we instinctively do?
We kind of meet together and we

00:17:48.581 --> 00:17:52.071
say, if anyone's cabin burns
down we'll all come over and

00:17:52.071 --> 00:17:54.064
help.
It kind of feels like

00:17:54.064 --> 00:17:57.765
generosity, but it's also a
self-interest that people

00:17:57.765 --> 00:18:00.373
perceive.
It could be me that--my cabin

00:18:00.373 --> 00:18:03.940
could burn down and I would
freeze to death in the winter.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.943
So, people naturally and
spontaneously make arrangements

00:18:08.943 --> 00:18:12.064
to share risks.
These kind of natural and

00:18:12.064 --> 00:18:15.968
spontaneous arrangements are not
global, they're not big enough

00:18:15.968 --> 00:18:19.717
and important enough.
I just want--one point of this

00:18:19.717 --> 00:18:24.340
lecture is to try to emphasize
the real breadth of the concepts

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.516
of finance and how important
they are--how they reach out

00:18:28.516 --> 00:18:32.991
into other things that you might
not think as associated with

00:18:32.991 --> 00:18:39.610
finance.
I want to mention socialism.

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:52.929
This term really goes back to
Robert Owen, who was a British

00:18:52.929 --> 00:19:00.992
thinker from 1771 to 1858,
who wanted to pool all the

00:19:00.992 --> 00:19:07.609
economic activity in society.
What were the motivations for

00:19:07.609 --> 00:19:10.461
doing this?
Well, I think he would say

00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:13.809
inequality--hardship would be
reduced.

00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:15.759
But, what was he really saying
in a sense?

00:19:15.759 --> 00:19:17.819
You might say it was risk
management.

00:19:17.819 --> 00:19:26.750
He wanted society to pool risks
and put things--put us together.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:32.998
In his ideal society--socialist
society--all the consumption

00:19:32.998 --> 00:19:38.278
would move up and down together,
just as in the ideal that

00:19:38.278 --> 00:19:40.830
Backus, Kehoe,
and Kydland expressed.

00:19:44.569 --> 00:19:51.160
Robert Owen wanted to create
this community.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.700
He created finally--he
emigrated to the United States

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.559
and he set up a city called New
Harmony.

00:19:57.559 --> 00:20:00.779
New Harmony was supposed to be
an inspiration.

00:20:00.779 --> 00:20:04.134
Unfortunately,
it didn't work very well

00:20:04.134 --> 00:20:09.695
because people started bickering
in his town and the New Harmony

00:20:09.695 --> 00:20:15.079
became kind of a joke--it was
not a harmonious community.

00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:19.010
So, he started to discover
moral hazard.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.412
You put everyone together and
you say, okay all of your

00:20:28.412 --> 00:20:32.407
economic fortunes are the same.
And what does someone start to

00:20:32.407 --> 00:20:34.891
conclude?
Well, they start to get lazy or

00:20:34.891 --> 00:20:39.685
they start to get irresponsible.
They think, it doesn't matter

00:20:39.685 --> 00:20:45.283
what I do, I'm going to get the
same consumption as everybody

00:20:45.283 --> 00:20:47.314
else,
so I'll just get lazy--a very

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:49.528
fundamental problem,
which you probably are already

00:20:49.528 --> 00:20:50.060
aware of.

00:20:56.269 --> 00:21:01.688
The socialist idea started to
lead to a number of experiments

00:21:01.688 --> 00:21:06.565
in various countries around the
world that were pooling

00:21:06.565 --> 00:21:10.809
risks--they might not have put
it this way.

00:21:10.809 --> 00:21:17.717
One is the kibbutzim in Israel,
which were communities that

00:21:17.717 --> 00:21:22.309
shared everything.
Originally, they were very

00:21:22.309 --> 00:21:26.723
rigid about this.
They enforced complete sharing

00:21:26.723 --> 00:21:32.681
and if you belonged to a kibbutz
you were completely stuck with

00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:40.400
the common consumption.
It wasn't just in Israel--in

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:47.299
Japan, the Ito-En and
Yamaguchi-kai;

00:21:47.299 --> 00:21:50.220
in the United States,
the Hutterites;

00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:56.759
and there are many other
examples.

00:21:56.759 --> 00:22:01.765
Joining one of these
communities has meant a real

00:22:01.765 --> 00:22:06.809
change in your life.
It's complete sharing.

00:22:06.809 --> 00:22:10.609
The problem is again the
ideal--they're trying to work

00:22:10.609 --> 00:22:15.269
toward what I think of an ideal
that we see in finance--mainly,

00:22:15.269 --> 00:22:18.088
the perfect correlation of
consumption and the elimination

00:22:18.088 --> 00:22:21.690
of risk--we all help each other.
But, the problem they hit is

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.862
moral hazard.
I've heard a lot of stories

00:22:25.862 --> 00:22:30.740
about a lot of bickering at the
kibbutz.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:34.284
When someone gets a gift and
the other people at the kibbutz

00:22:34.284 --> 00:22:37.348
say, "Well you can't have that
by yourself, we share

00:22:37.348 --> 00:22:39.452
everything."
Some people say,

00:22:39.452 --> 00:22:42.380
"I'd like to have my own
television set.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.772
I don't want to go to the
common room and watch the same

00:22:44.772 --> 00:22:46.608
set with everyone else.
I just, kind of,

00:22:46.608 --> 00:22:49.826
want to be at home by myself."
So, nowadays kibbutzim have

00:22:49.826 --> 00:22:53.171
loosened the rule.
I don't know these things

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:57.459
personally, but it's my
understanding that the whole

00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:02.251
structure is suffering some
moral hazard problems and that

00:23:02.251 --> 00:23:07.380
they're evolving and trying to
improve the institutions.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:14.690
There's also a problem with
risk-sharing at that level.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.449
That is, if you are one of
these commune communities,

00:23:18.449 --> 00:23:21.630
then you're just a small number
of people.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:25.771
The best you can do sharing
among yourselves is sharing your

00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:28.789
own risk, the risk of your own
community;

00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:32.957
but your own community goes up
and down and you're not sharing

00:23:32.957 --> 00:23:36.076
widely enough.
The problem is that if you want

00:23:36.076 --> 00:23:38.626
to do risk-sharing,
you're not, ideally,

00:23:38.626 --> 00:23:42.680
sharing with someone who's just
like you--living in Israel,

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.553
working in a certain
agricultural industry--because

00:23:46.553 --> 00:23:50.660
there are lots of risks that
you've already shared.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.246
You should be sharing your
risks with someone who's

00:23:53.246 --> 00:23:56.402
completely different--probably
living on the other side of the

00:23:56.402 --> 00:23:58.730
world in a completely different
industry,

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.176
where the weather,
the institutions,

00:24:01.176 --> 00:24:05.019
and the political situation are
completely different.

00:24:05.019 --> 00:24:09.062
It doesn't work so easily to
share with those people along

00:24:09.062 --> 00:24:12.325
the lines that these
communities--I think these

00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:15.730
communes tend to emphasize a
social compact,

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.883
a feeling for each other,
a caring for each other,

00:24:18.883 --> 00:24:22.229
which is a lovely thought but
it doesn't achieve risk

00:24:22.229 --> 00:24:26.842
management on a big scale.
I think that what's happening

00:24:26.842 --> 00:24:31.838
is these ideas--Everything is
evolving, so I'm actually

00:24:31.838 --> 00:24:36.742
presenting here our modern
finance as the outgrowth of

00:24:36.742 --> 00:24:40.696
socialism,
but that's not the usual way to

00:24:40.696 --> 00:24:43.292
present it.
I guess it is that we care

00:24:43.292 --> 00:24:46.930
about each other and we don't
want people to suffer alone.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.439
We want to share things,
but we want to get more

00:24:49.439 --> 00:24:52.535
scientific about how we share
things and that means--and we

00:24:52.535 --> 00:24:55.461
want to be effective.
So, that means we have to

00:24:55.461 --> 00:24:59.089
devise ways of sharing with
people that we've never met,

00:24:59.089 --> 00:25:01.826
that we don't care about--I
mean, maybe we care about

00:25:01.826 --> 00:25:04.984
everybody, but we don't have any
particular emotional ties to

00:25:04.984 --> 00:25:07.299
them--and they're very different
people.

00:25:07.299 --> 00:25:11.013
But, because of the logic of
risk management we have to make

00:25:11.013 --> 00:25:13.931
a deal with them;
so, it becomes more formal and

00:25:13.931 --> 00:25:16.949
impersonal.
That is what financial markets

00:25:16.949 --> 00:25:17.260
do.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.415
What's happening is:
we're seeing an evolution of

00:25:24.415 --> 00:25:26.850
risk management.
You hear about it in various

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.059
terms that sound abstract.
We have private equity,

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:34.299
we have venture capital,
and we have employees getting

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:38.092
incentive options.
These are efforts to solve the

00:25:38.092 --> 00:25:41.049
moral hazard problem and to
manage risks.

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:47.839
I believe that we're gradually
learning in our society.

00:25:47.839 --> 00:25:52.387
This is maybe not widely
appreciated, but every decade

00:25:52.387 --> 00:25:57.278
that goes by we do a better job
of incentvizing people and

00:25:57.278 --> 00:26:01.740
preventing them from being
discouraged by risks.

00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:13.124
It's a very complicated
situation because the kind of

00:26:13.124 --> 00:26:17.713
economic risks that we face are
difficult for most people to

00:26:17.713 --> 00:26:21.501
understand.
But they have to try to let

00:26:21.501 --> 00:26:25.772
people manage their own risks
for themselves,

00:26:25.772 --> 00:26:28.830
to some extent.
That means we have to expect

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:30.890
people to understand these
things somewhat.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.062
I think we have an important
role for economic,

00:26:34.062 --> 00:26:37.029
financial education.
Because of that,

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:41.648
each person is in a different
situation--it's a very

00:26:41.648 --> 00:26:46.539
complicated world and we have
many different risks.

00:26:46.539 --> 00:26:55.009
Continuing on the risk theme,
I mentioned one philosopher,

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:58.721
Robert Owen.
I could have also mentioned

00:26:58.721 --> 00:27:01.200
Karl Marx--why don't I mention
him here.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:06.561
He was a very important thinker
who had very low regard for the

00:27:06.561 --> 00:27:10.539
financial community,
I think, unfortunately.

00:27:10.539 --> 00:27:13.811
He wanted to kill them,
I think, or at least some of

00:27:13.811 --> 00:27:15.217
them.
Nonetheless,

00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:18.890
he shared certain things in
common with them.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:24.791
Namely, that he was concerned
about inequality,

00:27:24.791 --> 00:27:32.104
about some people doing badly,
and he proposed an economic

00:27:32.104 --> 00:27:36.980
alternative that would pool
risks.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:45.903
In fact, he actually emphasized
a concept that was first stated

00:27:45.903 --> 00:27:53.962
by a French philosopher Louis
Blanc in the mid-nineteenth

00:27:53.962 --> 00:27:59.420
century.
Blanc said the ideal society is

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.474
based on the principle of,
and now I quote,

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:11.454
"From each according to his
abilities, to each according to

00:28:11.454 --> 00:28:14.933
his needs."
Have you heard that quote

00:28:14.933 --> 00:28:17.928
before?
Karl Marx quoted Blanc,

00:28:17.928 --> 00:28:22.931
but he didn't credit Blanc.
He didn't mention the name

00:28:22.931 --> 00:28:26.476
because, I assume,
he thought everyone knew this

00:28:26.476 --> 00:28:31.078
was Blanc;.but Marx was falsely
attributed to having made that

00:28:31.078 --> 00:28:34.131
statement.
It's come around to us that

00:28:34.131 --> 00:28:37.902
that was--a lot of people say
that was the core of his

00:28:37.902 --> 00:28:42.569
communist philosophy.
That is complete risk-sharing,

00:28:42.569 --> 00:28:45.113
right?
Some of us have high abilities

00:28:45.113 --> 00:28:47.833
and we succeed,
some of us have low abilities

00:28:47.833 --> 00:28:50.860
and we fail;
but we all get the same good,

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.250
we all have our needs
satisfied.

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:58.416
So that, I think--The communist
system is effectively a theory

00:28:58.416 --> 00:29:03.583
of risk management and that's
not something you might think of

00:29:03.583 --> 00:29:06.633
usually.
What was the big problem with

00:29:06.633 --> 00:29:09.720
communism, as it was espoused by
Karl Marx?

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.164
The problem was that it had a
moral hazard problem and--I've

00:29:14.164 --> 00:29:18.532
already been through it--it's
the same moral hazard problem

00:29:18.532 --> 00:29:23.052
that you see at the kibbutzim
and the Yamaguchi-kai and other

00:29:23.052 --> 00:29:27.647
places: that people don't work
effectively when their economic

00:29:27.647 --> 00:29:33.523
interests are completely pooled.
Well, I suppose we've learned

00:29:33.523 --> 00:29:38.954
from the Marx experience,
but we're, I think--Just about

00:29:38.954 --> 00:29:44.089
every country of the world now
recognizes that it's a

00:29:44.089 --> 00:29:49.915
complicated thing to get risk
management working well and we

00:29:49.915 --> 00:29:54.259
have to design things more
carefully.

00:29:54.259 --> 00:29:56.713
We can't just smash things and
start all over,

00:29:56.713 --> 00:29:59.329
we have to design a system of
risk management.

00:29:59.329 --> 00:30:01.029
That's what I think finance is
about.

00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:06.598
I want to mention a couple
other philosophers who talk

00:30:06.598 --> 00:30:09.120
about risk management.

00:30:13.829 --> 00:30:19.371
One of them is the economist,
John Harsanyi,

00:30:19.371 --> 00:30:26.329
who won the Nobel Prize in
Economics some years ago,

00:30:26.329 --> 00:30:28.620
and another one is the
philosopher John Rawls,

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.470
who wrote the book Theory of
Justice, [John Rawls,

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.506
A Theory of Justice,
Cambridge MA:

00:30:33.506 --> 00:30:35.950
Belknap Press of Harvard
University Press,

00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:40.190
1971.]
which has become a classic.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:44.079
I think of both of these as
incorporating--I would,

00:30:44.079 --> 00:30:47.876
especially with Harsanyi,
but also with Rawls--as

00:30:47.876 --> 00:30:52.007
incorporating some idea of risk
management into our basic

00:30:52.007 --> 00:30:56.724
philosophy.
We have a philosophy that--most

00:30:56.724 --> 00:31:02.905
of us--that some kind of
economic inequality is a bad

00:31:02.905 --> 00:31:08.730
thing and that it's unjust for
someone who is,

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:13.820
for no fault of his or her own,
suffering economic hardship.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:19.902
How to formalize this idea?
John Harsanyi was the first to

00:31:19.902 --> 00:31:21.654
write about this.
[John Harsanyi,

00:31:21.654 --> 00:31:23.061
"Cardinal Welfare,
Individualistic Ethics,

00:31:23.061 --> 00:31:24.913
and Interpersonal Comparisons
of Utility" Journal of

00:31:24.913 --> 00:31:26.045
Political Economy 63(4)
1955.]

00:31:26.045 --> 00:31:27.795
He said that we should think
of--When we think about

00:31:27.795 --> 00:31:29.888
distributional justice we can
think of it as a risk management

00:31:29.888 --> 00:31:33.254
problem.
He said, imagine that we could

00:31:33.254 --> 00:31:38.773
get people to have a big town
meeting for the whole world and,

00:31:38.773 --> 00:31:44.138
he said, before they were born.
There's some space up in heaven

00:31:44.138 --> 00:31:48.493
where all the unborn babies are
that will live in the future

00:31:48.493 --> 00:31:49.832
and,
unfortunately,

00:31:49.832 --> 00:31:52.240
they're not able to have a town
meeting;

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.987
but, let's suppose they could.
We're up there in heaven

00:31:56.987 --> 00:32:01.432
thinking about our lives in the
future, as people,

00:32:01.432 --> 00:32:05.216
and what would we do?
Suppose we don't know what

00:32:05.216 --> 00:32:08.677
economic circumstances we'd be
born into and what kind of

00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:12.369
contingencies we'd have in life.
What would we decide?

00:32:12.369 --> 00:32:16.749
Suppose we were trying to
decide on a constitution for the

00:32:16.749 --> 00:32:20.057
world in that state.
John Rawls expanded on this and

00:32:20.057 --> 00:32:22.040
he called it the "original
position."

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:26.917
What would they do?
Well, they would probably agree

00:32:26.917 --> 00:32:28.890
that we'd do some risk-sharing,
right?

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.311
Everyone who's thinking,
I don't know whether I'll be

00:32:32.311 --> 00:32:35.206
rich or poor,
so I would like to have a world

00:32:35.206 --> 00:32:38.870
in which risks are shared.
On the other hand,

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:42.578
what would you decide?
If you can imagine yourself in

00:32:42.578 --> 00:32:44.747
that situation,
what would you decide about

00:32:44.747 --> 00:32:47.197
inequality?
Would you decide to have a

00:32:47.197 --> 00:32:51.599
world with absolute equality?
Well, you know somebody would

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:53.840
probably.
Suppose someone proposed that

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:56.806
up in heaven and someone else
might say, well that's not going

00:32:56.806 --> 00:33:00.102
to work so well,
that's like a kibbutz--like one

00:33:00.102 --> 00:33:02.996
of the kibbutzim.
It's not going to work,

00:33:02.996 --> 00:33:06.095
we're not going to
enjoy--something's wrong with

00:33:06.095 --> 00:33:09.722
that because it's going to
create a moral hazard problem

00:33:09.722 --> 00:33:12.690
and we're not going to be as
productive.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.718
Someone might also say,
you know a little inequality,

00:33:15.718 --> 00:33:19.272
even a substantial inequality,
is not so bad as long as nobody

00:33:19.272 --> 00:33:21.960
is really suffering.
As long as everyone has the

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:24.160
basic needs and they're--we can
all be happy.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.296
You know, let's let some people
make big fortunes because that

00:33:28.296 --> 00:33:31.279
provides spice in life and some
adventure,

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:34.160
something to look forward
to--that you might get this.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.489
You could see saying,
we don't want to eliminate

00:33:37.489 --> 00:33:42.034
inequality.
What Harsanyi and Rawls both

00:33:42.034 --> 00:33:48.247
gave us was a system of justice
that, in my mind,

00:33:48.247 --> 00:33:54.460
conveys a sense of financial
risk management.

00:33:59.349 --> 00:34:04.857
I'm not going to talk a lot
about--Well, I'm going to move

00:34:04.857 --> 00:34:09.205
also to framing here,
but let me at this point

00:34:09.205 --> 00:34:13.360
mention something about public
finance.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.920
This is not a course in public
finance.

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.494
It doesn't say--The title of
this course is Financial

00:34:18.494 --> 00:34:20.904
Markets.
I guess when you put markets on

00:34:20.904 --> 00:34:23.683
it that doesn't sound like
public finance but,

00:34:23.683 --> 00:34:28.242
even so, it could.
Public finance is the financial

00:34:28.242 --> 00:34:33.677
issues relating to governments.
Finance usually means the

00:34:33.677 --> 00:34:37.150
private sector,
but the issues are much the

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.878
same in both cases.
Let me say something about

00:34:40.878 --> 00:34:47.618
public finance here.
Public finance relates to the

00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:54.250
tax and welfare system that we
have.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:35:01.146
The government taxes people and
it takes some of the money and

00:35:01.146 --> 00:35:05.329
redistributes it to people in
need.

00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:10.920
This is essentially a risk
management system.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.340
It's something that,
I suppose, Robert Owen and Karl

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.559
Marx would have said sounds like
a good thing.

00:35:17.559 --> 00:35:19.938
But, of course,
they wanted to do much more and

00:35:19.938 --> 00:35:22.940
be more comprehensive.
It's maybe something that has

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.489
evolved as something that
actually works.

00:35:25.489 --> 00:35:29.351
You have a progressive tax
system that takes more money

00:35:29.351 --> 00:35:33.570
from the wealthier people and
you have a welfare system that

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.860
looks at individual hardship and
pays out.

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.784
It does create moral hazard
problems--that's a problem with

00:35:40.784 --> 00:35:44.369
it, but that's something that
we're learning about.

00:35:44.369 --> 00:35:48.309
That's part of public
finance--is learning how to

00:35:48.309 --> 00:35:52.659
modify the tax system so that it
works pretty well.

00:35:52.659 --> 00:35:56.536
I want to start out by
mentioning taxes and welfare

00:35:56.536 --> 00:35:59.793
because, I think,
that it's really the most

00:35:59.793 --> 00:36:03.980
important risk management system
already in place.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.613
Because the financial risk
management system that we have

00:36:07.613 --> 00:36:09.949
is imperfect,
we aren't there yet.

00:36:09.949 --> 00:36:13.491
The thing that's really doing
the heavy hitting on risk

00:36:13.491 --> 00:36:16.769
management is really the tax and
welfare system.

00:36:16.769 --> 00:36:21.602
That's because the most
important risk that individuals

00:36:21.602 --> 00:36:25.630
face is the risk of major losses
of income.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:30.665
If something really hits you
hard and you would be starving,

00:36:30.665 --> 00:36:35.662
that would be really bad.
So, nobody starves in advanced

00:36:35.662 --> 00:36:40.420
countries of the world today
because of this system.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:45.358
Moreover, you might get hit by
an illness and then you could be

00:36:45.358 --> 00:36:49.899
in desperate trouble that you
will die unless you get some

00:36:49.899 --> 00:36:53.550
kind of emergency care,
which might be very expensive.

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.443
Every advanced country in the
world has a system that provides

00:36:57.443 --> 00:37:00.889
for this, including the United
States, incidentally.

00:37:00.889 --> 00:37:05.119
We don't have a national
healthcare system.

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:09.030
People say we don't--well,
we don't, but we do have an

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:13.530
emergency care system so that
anybody who is suddenly stricken

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.219
will be taken to a hospital and
taken care of.

00:37:17.219 --> 00:37:20.210
It's not perfect,
but it is there.

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:23.379
What we do have we should be
thankful for,

00:37:23.379 --> 00:37:27.002
it's very important.
I thought this would be a good

00:37:27.002 --> 00:37:29.758
lead in to the second theme of
this lecture,

00:37:29.758 --> 00:37:34.730
which is framing.
We have a good system in taxes,

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:40.920
but it's imperfect because it
hasn't been thought out

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.920
thoroughly in terms of risk
management.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.120
Let's talk about framing and
taxes.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:57.439
If you go to look at
congressional discussion of tax

00:37:57.439 --> 00:38:01.650
rates, you won't see risk
management mentioned very often.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:06.676
They seem to talk about it in
their own terms,

00:38:06.676 --> 00:38:12.149
which to a public finance
expert is, I don't know,

00:38:12.149 --> 00:38:16.170
very populist or
unprofessional.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.212
I guess they're elected
officials and their voters are

00:38:19.212 --> 00:38:22.830
not finance theorists and don't
think of this in these terms.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:38.514
Edward McCaffery did a history
of taxes--I'm sorry,

00:38:38.514 --> 00:38:49.866
spelled with two Cs--he's a law
professor in the United States

00:38:49.866 --> 00:39:01.590
and asked about--based on issues
of framing and psychology.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:03.715
We have a system,
which you say it really--The

00:39:03.715 --> 00:39:06.172
progressive tax system is very
important but it's not

00:39:06.172 --> 00:39:07.636
conceptualized right.

00:39:15.771 --> 00:39:19.349
What McCaffery points out is
that the only time the

00:39:19.349 --> 00:39:23.571
government in the United States
has ever been able to impose

00:39:23.571 --> 00:39:27.150
high taxes on wealthy people was
during wars.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:30.389
If you look at the history of
U.S.

00:39:30.389 --> 00:39:33.826
taxes, the very simple history
is World War One and World War

00:39:33.826 --> 00:39:36.248
Two.
During World War One and Two,

00:39:36.248 --> 00:39:39.976
our men were out dying in
Europe and people voted for

00:39:39.976 --> 00:39:43.070
someone who said,
let's raise the taxes on the

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.739
rich, someone's profiting from
this war now.

00:39:45.739 --> 00:39:49.492
It doesn't sound right when
other men are out there dying,

00:39:49.492 --> 00:39:52.389
so they raised taxes during
World War One.

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:55.339
They did it again,
even more decisively in World

00:39:55.339 --> 00:39:58.539
War Two, and that's how we got
progressive taxes.

00:39:58.539 --> 00:40:03.877
I'm oversimplifying a little
bit but between wars the rate

00:40:03.877 --> 00:40:07.529
tends to come down because
people think,

00:40:07.529 --> 00:40:11.159
well the war is over.
They don't understand the risk

00:40:11.159 --> 00:40:14.236
management function of it.
Politicians are reluctant to

00:40:14.236 --> 00:40:16.769
cut taxes, but they do it
gradually.

00:40:16.769 --> 00:40:19.470
That's a simple history of
taxes.

00:40:33.429 --> 00:40:42.161
Actually, in the United States,
the income tax came in during

00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:50.310
the American Civil War and it
was--the income tax came in

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:51.620
1861,

00:40:58.309 --> 00:41:04.670
again during the war and it was
a progressive tax.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:11.127
The tax, as of 1862,
was 3% on incomes over $600 a

00:41:11.127 --> 00:41:13.791
year.
That sounds kind of low,

00:41:13.791 --> 00:41:17.444
that was 1862.
Then they raised it to 5% on

00:41:17.444 --> 00:41:20.721
incomes over $10,000.
It was a beginning,

00:41:20.721 --> 00:41:24.440
but it didn't take because they
had technical problems.

00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:37.918
I mention this tax example
because I want to stress that

00:41:37.918 --> 00:41:43.211
framing and psychological
barriers are important problems

00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:46.520
for creating financial markets.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:58.199
The idea is that people don't
see this basic risk management

00:41:58.199 --> 00:42:02.770
problem and they see things in
entirely different terms.

00:42:09.809 --> 00:42:17.034
So Kahneman and Tversky talked
about how people view financial

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:24.377
gains and losses and they talked
about how people's actions are

00:42:24.377 --> 00:42:31.010
very valuable depending on how
things are presented.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:35.091
In one of their most famous
examples, they asked people the

00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:37.976
following question:
Suppose you had bought

00:42:37.976 --> 00:42:41.881
expensive tickets to a concert,
very expensive,

00:42:41.881 --> 00:42:46.957
you paid $200 for each ticket.
You have two tickets,

00:42:46.957 --> 00:42:52.251
$400 worth, and on the way to
the concert you lose the

00:42:52.251 --> 00:42:55.085
tickets.
Now, you've arrived at the

00:42:55.085 --> 00:42:58.956
concert hall and you're looking
through your pocket and you

00:42:58.956 --> 00:43:01.760
realize they're gone--you've
lost them.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:07.090
The question they asked people
is: would you go to the window

00:43:07.090 --> 00:43:12.510
and buy another pair of tickets
for $400, having lost them?

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:16.577
People answered--most people
said, no, I'd be so annoyed and

00:43:16.577 --> 00:43:18.989
angry with myself I'd just
leave.

00:43:18.989 --> 00:43:23.501
But then they posed a different
version of the same question and

00:43:23.501 --> 00:43:27.584
the different version was:
Suppose you had ordered tickets

00:43:27.584 --> 00:43:31.881
to pick them up and pay for them
at the window at the concert

00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:35.820
hall and you brought $400 in
cash in your pocket.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:41.219
You arrive and you realize
you've lost your $400.

00:43:41.219 --> 00:43:45.677
Now, the choice is:
you could--What are you going

00:43:45.677 --> 00:43:48.259
to do?
Would you go to the ticket

00:43:48.259 --> 00:43:52.646
window and use your credit card
to pick up the tickets or would

00:43:52.646 --> 00:43:55.829
you just walk away in anger and
annoyance?

00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:59.497
Well, most people say,
oh I would just go to the

00:43:59.497 --> 00:44:04.144
window and buy the tickets.
Does that sound plausible that

00:44:04.144 --> 00:44:08.141
you could see the difference?
But, in economic terms,

00:44:08.141 --> 00:44:12.206
there's no difference between
losing the tickets and losing

00:44:12.206 --> 00:44:15.150
$400, so why do you behave
differently?

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:18.369
Well, that's framing.
Because in your mind you're

00:44:18.369 --> 00:44:21.789
putting tickets and cash in
different mental accounts,

00:44:21.789 --> 00:44:26.887
the mental account "tickets"
generates an emotional feeling

00:44:26.887 --> 00:44:31.809
and it changes my action--that I
lost in that account.

00:44:31.809 --> 00:44:36.882
Unfortunately,
that's--unfortunately people's

00:44:36.882 --> 00:44:42.070
decisions are biased by that
kind of thing.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:47.830
So, we have to frame things
as--put things in the mental

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:53.172
categories--presentation
matters--so that people can

00:44:53.172 --> 00:44:58.926
manage their risks right.
Kahneman and Tversky also--and

00:44:58.926 --> 00:45:02.639
others have also talked about
insurance.

00:45:02.639 --> 00:45:07.338
They've asked people a question
and then phrased it in two

00:45:07.338 --> 00:45:09.923
different ways.
One of them was,

00:45:09.923 --> 00:45:13.920
would you buy insurance against
such and such a risk?

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.721
The same question was rephrased
in another way,

00:45:17.721 --> 00:45:22.431
without mentioning the word
insurance--they just described

00:45:22.431 --> 00:45:24.669
it.
They said, would you sign a

00:45:24.669 --> 00:45:28.357
contract that if you had this
loss the contract would pay you

00:45:28.357 --> 00:45:32.489
a certain amount of money?
The percent of people who said

00:45:32.489 --> 00:45:36.641
yes to that was lower because
they didn't put it in an

00:45:36.641 --> 00:45:39.825
insurance frame.
We are accustomed to thinking

00:45:39.825 --> 00:45:43.798
of insurance as a good thing.
If I talk about it in general

00:45:43.798 --> 00:45:48.083
terms, they might not put it in
that frame and they might

00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:54.654
notâ€“ Really,
an important example of framing

00:45:54.654 --> 00:46:01.380
is how we deal with money and
indexation.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:07.810
We have a "money frame" of
thinking and a "real frame."

00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:16.160
The value of money changes
through time because of

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:20.391
inflation or deflation;
yet, most of our debts are

00:46:20.391 --> 00:46:24.497
written in money terms.
That is, they're not indexed

00:46:24.497 --> 00:46:27.855
for inflation.
If you wanted to have a real

00:46:27.855 --> 00:46:33.182
frame, then you would index to
the consumer price index or some

00:46:33.182 --> 00:46:38.417
other inflation index.
Most of us are accustomed to a

00:46:38.417 --> 00:46:44.591
money frame, so most of us--when
we lend money to each other,

00:46:44.591 --> 00:46:49.333
we do it in money terms.
You merely say--For example,

00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:52.419
if your friend asked to borrow
$100 from you,

00:46:52.419 --> 00:46:56.697
you would probably not say--you
might actually put interest on

00:46:56.697 --> 00:46:58.716
this person,
so you could say,

00:46:58.716 --> 00:47:01.679
alright, I'll do it with 5%
interest, pay me back in a year.

00:47:01.679 --> 00:47:04.932
You would probably not even
think to say,

00:47:04.932 --> 00:47:09.648
pay me 3% interest plus the
rate of inflation over the next

00:47:09.648 --> 00:47:12.707
year.
That would be putting it in a

00:47:12.707 --> 00:47:16.559
real frame and--wouldn't that be
more sensible,

00:47:16.559 --> 00:47:20.694
because you would be specifying
the contract in real terms

00:47:20.694 --> 00:47:27.113
rather than money terms?
Yet, most people just don't do

00:47:27.113 --> 00:47:29.990
that.
Most of our fixed incomes,

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:34.385
as they're called--which are
assets that are denominated in

00:47:34.385 --> 00:47:38.704
currency--Most of our debts are
written in money terms and

00:47:38.704 --> 00:47:43.099
people can't get over this
framing in terms of money.

00:47:43.099 --> 00:47:46.242
It's a powerful psychological,
you might say,

00:47:46.242 --> 00:47:49.313
illusion--people think they
want money when,

00:47:49.313 --> 00:47:53.170
in fact, they should want real
goods and services.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.900
So, that's an example of a
framing issue.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:03.696
Now, I want to move to the
third theme of this lecture,

00:48:03.696 --> 00:48:06.340
which is invention.

00:48:14.719 --> 00:48:22.910
As I said, progress in finance
requires an inventive process

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:29.991
and invention occurs in a milieu
of other invention,

00:48:29.991 --> 00:48:34.850
notably information technology.

00:48:40.119 --> 00:48:47.324
I said this is an earlier
lecture, but a financial device

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:55.300
is a complicated device like any
engine or any other thing that

00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:02.889
they patent and develop to solve
some physical problem.

00:49:02.889 --> 00:49:10.363
For example,
let's talk about an insurance

00:49:10.363 --> 00:49:16.355
policy as an invention.
An insurance policy--the

00:49:16.355 --> 00:49:19.166
concept is very simple,
we could talk about fire

00:49:19.166 --> 00:49:23.366
insurance or life insurance.
Life insurance is designed to

00:49:23.366 --> 00:49:27.573
protectâ€“ideally,
it protects parents with young

00:49:27.573 --> 00:49:31.699
children--that's the most
important application.

00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:35.452
If one of the parents dies,
it creates hardship for the

00:49:35.452 --> 00:49:39.552
family because the remaining
parent has the burden of caring

00:49:39.552 --> 00:49:43.305
for children and earning a
livelihood to support all of

00:49:43.305 --> 00:49:45.818
them.
It is very difficult,

00:49:45.818 --> 00:49:50.480
so we have a policy that pays
them if one of them dies.

00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:56.949
It's not easy to devise this
and the concept is very simple.

00:49:56.949 --> 00:50:02.262
In order to devise an insurance
contact that does this job,

00:50:02.262 --> 00:50:07.574
we have to have a contract
between an insurance company and

00:50:07.574 --> 00:50:11.059
the insured.
The contract has to specify

00:50:11.059 --> 00:50:15.099
what are the causes of,
let's say, death or a situation

00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:19.043
in which one is covered.
We have to then realize that

00:50:19.043 --> 00:50:22.935
there is a moral hazard problem.
We have to exclude certain

00:50:22.935 --> 00:50:26.250
causes, like suicide,
in the case of life insurance.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:29.380
In other kinds of insurance it
gets very complicated.

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:32.890
You have to exclude those
causes that generate moral

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:35.920
hazard problems for the
insurance to work;

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:38.010
otherwise, the whole system
will fail.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:41.053
When they invented fire
insurance, in the 1600s,

00:50:41.053 --> 00:50:44.744
there was a lot of skepticism
because anyone can burn down

00:50:44.744 --> 00:50:47.373
their house.
They said, it's not going to

00:50:47.373 --> 00:50:50.787
work because you have to decide
how much the house is insured

00:50:50.787 --> 00:50:53.916
for and then anybody--If you
ever make a mistake and you

00:50:53.916 --> 00:50:57.030
insure it for too much,
then the people who realize

00:50:57.030 --> 00:51:00.409
they've got one on the insurance
company--they've insured the

00:51:00.409 --> 00:51:03.451
house for more than it's
worth--they'll burn down their

00:51:03.451 --> 00:51:06.746
house and collect the money.
Now, how can the insurance

00:51:06.746 --> 00:51:09.949
company ever evaluate every
house properly to avoid that?

00:51:09.949 --> 00:51:12.544
They had to work on that,
they had to devise--they had to

00:51:12.544 --> 00:51:15.277
get an appraisal industry that
could appraise houses and get

00:51:15.277 --> 00:51:17.269
some idea of what they're really
worth.

00:51:17.269 --> 00:51:20.021
They had to get that all worked
out, it had to be done

00:51:20.021 --> 00:51:23.031
accurately, and they had to
decide to keep a certain amount

00:51:23.031 --> 00:51:25.096
of co-insurance.
In other words,

00:51:25.096 --> 00:51:29.338
lower the amount insured below
the actual value of the house to

00:51:29.338 --> 00:51:34.856
prevent moral hazard.
They had to develop statistics

00:51:34.856 --> 00:51:37.250
of loss;
they had to know what the

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:39.794
losses were.
In the case of life insurance,

00:51:39.794 --> 00:51:43.541
they developed actuarial tables
that require a collecting of

00:51:43.541 --> 00:51:45.553
statistics.
Then of course,

00:51:45.553 --> 00:51:50.120
there's the other problem that
the insurance company--how does

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.912
the insurance company reasonably
specify that it can come through

00:51:54.912 --> 00:51:58.722
on this policy?
You have to have the insurance

00:51:58.722 --> 00:52:03.579
company set up with a structure
itself that guarantees that they

00:52:03.579 --> 00:52:08.590
have enough reserves to meet the
losses that they might incur.

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:12.691
That requires a theory of
capital and they're going to

00:52:12.691 --> 00:52:16.559
have to invest the reserves in
financial assets.

00:52:16.559 --> 00:52:19.597
Then you have to ask,
well how are the financial

00:52:19.597 --> 00:52:21.860
assets going to behave over
time?

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:26.100
Then it becomes a theory
of--all of finance comes in as

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.107
well.
Moreover, beyond that,

00:52:28.107 --> 00:52:31.021
how does one know,
in taking out an insurance

00:52:31.021 --> 00:52:34.929
policy, that the insurance
company is going to be sound?

00:52:34.929 --> 00:52:38.620
The insurance company has to
have some way of demonstrating

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:42.934
its soundness to the public.
Moreover, we have regulators

00:52:42.934 --> 00:52:47.914
who have to regulate insurance
companies and make sure that

00:52:47.914 --> 00:52:52.292
they have adequate capital.
So, it's a very complicated

00:52:52.292 --> 00:52:54.047
industry.
Although, I said,

00:52:54.047 --> 00:52:57.503
insurance was effectively
discovered or invented in the

00:52:57.503 --> 00:52:59.834
1600s,
it has been slow to grow

00:52:59.834 --> 00:53:03.634
because they didn't have the
well-defined--all of the

00:53:03.634 --> 00:53:04.950
inventions yet.

00:53:13.329 --> 00:53:17.059
I wanted to just give
some--often the inventions that

00:53:17.059 --> 00:53:20.429
occur in finance,
they seem in a way obvious.

00:53:20.429 --> 00:53:22.780
Some of the things I
said--you'd probably say,

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:25.915
well I should have known that
an insurance company would have

00:53:25.915 --> 00:53:30.057
to do that, but it isn't.
What's obvious after the fact

00:53:30.057 --> 00:53:33.590
is not what's obvious before the
fact.

00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:38.430
One thing I'd like to stress is
that the history of technology

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:43.271
is sometimes a history of very
glamorous, unobvious ideas like

00:53:43.271 --> 00:53:45.770
nuclear power.
That's amazing,

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:49.340
you can get atoms to smash
atoms and create a chain

00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:52.839
reaction and create
power--that's a pretty amazing

00:53:52.839 --> 00:53:55.731
invention.
But a lot of the inventions

00:53:55.731 --> 00:53:58.429
that matter to us are extremely
simple.

00:53:58.429 --> 00:54:01.570
They're kind of staring in your
face obvious.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:06.084
Let me just give some example
of--sometimes people are very

00:54:06.084 --> 00:54:10.210
slow to see the obvious,
or it seems so in history.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.459
I'd like to talk about the
invention of the wheel--that's

00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:15.489
the most famous invention,
right?

00:54:15.489 --> 00:54:18.591
It's a cliché--People
say, let's not reinvent the

00:54:18.591 --> 00:54:20.789
wheel here, so let's go back to
that.

00:54:20.789 --> 00:54:24.604
Inventing the wheel--it seems,
what could be more obvious than

00:54:24.604 --> 00:54:28.664
a wheel?
Well, it apparently is not so

00:54:28.664 --> 00:54:34.231
obvious because in the Americas,
before Columbus

00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:40.035
came--pre-Columbian
America--there were no wheeled

00:54:40.035 --> 00:54:45.197
vehicles anywhere.
We had civilizations--Aztecs,

00:54:45.197 --> 00:54:48.980
Mayas, Incas,
etc.--but no wheeled vehicles.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:53.885
Now, the amazing thing is,
if you go to Mexico you can go

00:54:53.885 --> 00:54:59.228
to museums that have children's
toys from pre-Columbian Mexico

00:54:59.228 --> 00:55:01.886
with wheels.
They were little toys

00:55:01.886 --> 00:55:05.416
that--they would be shaped like
animals or something and you

00:55:05.416 --> 00:55:09.143
could roll them along the floor.
So, why didn't somebody think

00:55:09.143 --> 00:55:12.184
of--you're sitting there with
your child playing with a

00:55:12.184 --> 00:55:15.337
wheeled toy and then you're
going out to carry some heavy

00:55:15.337 --> 00:55:18.210
stuff and you're dragging it
along the ground.

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:21.500
Why didn't you think of putting
wheels under it?

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:25.210
Well, it's apparently not so
obvious.

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:29.139
Some very obvious ideas are not
so obvious.

00:55:29.139 --> 00:55:32.201
Some people today think,
I just can't imagine,

00:55:32.201 --> 00:55:35.806
this history can't be right,
I don't believe that they

00:55:35.806 --> 00:55:39.480
hadn't invented wheels in
America before Columbus.

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.532
To argue with them,
I point out an example,

00:55:42.532 --> 00:55:45.254
which is more familiar.
Unfortunately,

00:55:45.254 --> 00:55:48.422
you people are too young to
have experienced this,

00:55:48.422 --> 00:55:52.429
but I've experienced this and
you can talk to your parents.

00:55:52.429 --> 00:55:57.768
It used to be,
before 1972,

00:55:57.768 --> 00:56:04.750
that suitcases never had
wheels.

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:07.330
You probably own a wheeled
suitcase, right?

00:56:07.330 --> 00:56:12.150
Most of you do.
The idea of putting wheels on

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:19.349
suitcases goes back only to 1972
and it was Bernard Sadow who

00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:25.315
invented--this is amazing,
right--the wheeled suitcase and

00:56:25.315 --> 00:56:28.993
he got a patent on it.
He had a suitcase that--I don't

00:56:28.993 --> 00:56:31.299
know exactly,
something like this--had a

00:56:31.299 --> 00:56:34.965
strap that you'd pull it along
and it had four little wheels on

00:56:34.965 --> 00:56:39.481
the bottom and it worked.
I had my student research

00:56:39.481 --> 00:56:45.293
assistant find that guy,
let's call him up and ask him

00:56:45.293 --> 00:56:47.630
about it.
It's so recent.

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:50.991
So my student called Bernard
Sadow up and asked him about his

00:56:50.991 --> 00:56:53.456
invention and he said,
"Yeah, I was thinking,

00:56:53.456 --> 00:56:55.810
why don't we have wheels on
suitcases?

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:58.631
So I just did it."
He said, "I had a lot of

00:56:58.631 --> 00:57:02.779
trouble, I took it to department
stores and I said,

00:57:02.779 --> 00:57:05.881
why don't you sell this?
I'm making it,

00:57:05.881 --> 00:57:08.911
add it to your luggage."
He said he met a lot of

00:57:08.911 --> 00:57:12.173
resistance.
The department stores said no

00:57:12.173 --> 00:57:15.599
and so we asked,
why would they say no?

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:17.639
I mean, it's such an obviously
good idea.

00:57:17.639 --> 00:57:21.659
He said, "They said people
won't buy it.

00:57:21.659 --> 00:57:24.084
Anyway, they said,
look you go to any train

00:57:24.084 --> 00:57:27.432
station and there are these red
caps or porters and they'll

00:57:27.432 --> 00:57:30.660
carry your suitcase for you.
You don't need wheels."

00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:34.288
That's what they told him.
But, it seemed like there was

00:57:34.288 --> 00:57:36.775
kind of a way of thinking.
I think maybe people would be

00:57:36.775 --> 00:57:38.979
embarrassed.
If you were the only guy with

00:57:38.979 --> 00:57:41.938
wheels on your suitcase,
people would think you look a

00:57:41.938 --> 00:57:49.107
little odd.
Anyway, it's interesting the

00:57:49.107 --> 00:57:57.561
wheeled suitcase came in 1972.
The problem with Sadow's

00:57:57.561 --> 00:58:00.901
suitcase--I actually had one and
you might have one in your

00:58:00.901 --> 00:58:03.082
attic.
You can go up and look at it

00:58:03.082 --> 00:58:06.465
because your parents probably
bought one and it's still up

00:58:06.465 --> 00:58:08.489
there.
You can take it out and try

00:58:08.489 --> 00:58:10.420
wheeling it along with that
strap.

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:12.579
It kind of works,
but it wobbles,

00:58:12.579 --> 00:58:16.289
especially if you're hurrying
to catch your airplane.

00:58:16.289 --> 00:58:18.800
That thing starts fish-tailing
and wobbling.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:23.836
You've just got a strap you're
pulling it on--so obviously

00:58:23.836 --> 00:58:28.552
there was a design defect.
Finally, it was Robert Plath,

00:58:28.552 --> 00:58:31.876
who was an airline pilot who
invented a new,

00:58:31.876 --> 00:58:35.510
wheeled suitcase,
which he patented in 1991.

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:39.683
This suitcase had--instead of
having four little wheels on the

00:58:39.683 --> 00:58:42.420
bottom, it had two wheels on the
back.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.010
You didn't pull the suitcase
lengthwise;

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:48.360
you pulled it widthwise,
so it gave you a stable base.

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:51.876
Moreover, instead of having a
strap he had this thing that--a

00:58:51.876 --> 00:58:55.275
rigid thing--that you pull out
from this--you know what I'm

00:58:55.275 --> 00:58:57.921
talking about?
He invented--he called it the

00:58:57.921 --> 00:59:00.131
RollAboard.
He also had the idea that he

00:59:00.131 --> 00:59:03.344
would make it narrow enough so
that when you're boarding an

00:59:03.344 --> 00:59:06.170
airplane you can still roll it
down the aisle of the

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.406
airplane--it just fit perfectly.
So, that was the

00:59:09.406 --> 00:59:12.526
RollAboard--that was 1991.
That's getting into recent

00:59:12.526 --> 00:59:14.143
memory.
It's so obvious,

00:59:14.143 --> 00:59:16.849
why didn't they have them
before?

00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:20.449
Well, things that seem obvious
are not obvious and it has

00:59:20.449 --> 00:59:23.469
something to do with--something
like framing.

00:59:23.469 --> 00:59:25.703
We tend to think of doing
things in a certain

00:59:25.703 --> 00:59:28.546
way--everyone else is doing
it--and we assume that that's

00:59:28.546 --> 00:59:30.120
the smart way to do things.

00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:40.019
That limits us and it's very
hard to get new ideas started,

00:59:40.019 --> 00:59:44.501
but they do get started;
so, I think we'll get some

00:59:44.501 --> 00:59:48.766
really obvious advances.
One thing about inventions is

00:59:48.766 --> 00:59:51.719
that we have something called
patents.

00:59:51.719 --> 00:59:58.786
The patent office grants patent
rights to inventions,

00:59:58.786 --> 01:00:05.309
but traditionally
in--everywhere in the world,

01:00:05.309 --> 01:00:10.388
really, financial inventions
were not considered worthy of

01:00:10.388 --> 01:00:14.544
patenting because,
I guess, patent law came in

01:00:14.544 --> 01:00:19.910
response to things like the
steam engine and the power loom,

01:00:19.910 --> 01:00:23.318
which were physical inventions.
They didn't think of financial

01:00:23.318 --> 01:00:28.091
inventions as worthy of patents.
Now, we're starting to see

01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:32.949
patent offices accepting
financial devices.

01:00:32.949 --> 01:00:36.632
It happened in the late 1990s,
in the United States,

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:40.820
that patent offices started to
accept financial patents.

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:47.027
Now there are several countries
thatâ€“-Japan,

01:00:47.027 --> 01:00:53.362
Korea, and elsewhere--are
starting to see financial

01:00:53.362 --> 01:00:58.050
invention as a serious
invention.

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:09.532
The last thing is information
technology, as a driver of

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:11.620
finance.

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.873
Now, I'd like to stress
information technology because

01:01:23.873 --> 01:01:27.986
we are living in a time of rapid
advance, as you know--I don't

01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:31.529
have to tell you this.
Computers are becoming more and

01:01:31.529 --> 01:01:34.589
more a part of our lives and
this is something that is

01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:37.769
transforming the world.
What is it that makes us

01:01:37.769 --> 01:01:40.367
uniquely human?
You might say--or a good part

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:42.710
of--it is our ability to process
information.

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:46.219
We differ from lower animals
and our brains,

01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:50.464
which are much more capable of
storing and processing

01:01:50.464 --> 01:01:53.457
information,
but we're living in a time of

01:01:53.457 --> 01:01:56.775
revolution when machines are
challenging or competing with

01:01:56.775 --> 01:01:59.645
our brains.
This may create economic

01:01:59.645 --> 01:02:03.927
dislocations that we will see
throughout our lives,

01:02:03.927 --> 01:02:07.953
but also creates
opportunities--I want to stress

01:02:07.953 --> 01:02:13.019
on the opportunities.
A lot of financial innovation

01:02:13.019 --> 01:02:17.230
is co-evolved with information
technology.

01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:22.592
A lot of simple ideas of risk
management are ideas that

01:02:22.592 --> 01:02:27.856
require well-designed
information technology and we've

01:02:27.856 --> 01:02:33.814
seen a lot of advances in the
last couple centuries that make

01:02:33.814 --> 01:02:39.158
financial innovation possible.
I thought I would give you an

01:02:39.158 --> 01:02:42.146
example from the nineteenth
century, which is very

01:02:42.146 --> 01:02:44.829
important, and again it's public
finance.

01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:49.030
I'm not going to stress public
finance so much in this course

01:02:49.030 --> 01:02:52.949
but it seems--I'm going to give
the example of nineteenth

01:02:52.949 --> 01:02:56.869
century information technology
and the nineteenth century

01:02:56.869 --> 01:03:02.331
invention of social security.
Let's go back to the nineteenth

01:03:02.331 --> 01:03:07.576
century, that's the 1800s,
that was a wonderful century

01:03:07.576 --> 01:03:12.051
for information technology.
You probably don't think of it

01:03:12.051 --> 01:03:14.081
that way because you say,
wait a minute,

01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:16.580
the computer wasn't invented
until the 1940s.

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:20.381
Actually, you would be wrong;
the computer was invented in

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:24.324
the nineteenth century by
Babbage, but he didn't actually

01:03:24.324 --> 01:03:27.293
make one.
He wrote down a design,

01:03:27.293 --> 01:03:30.710
which was similar to what we do
now.

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:34.164
There were a lot of other
things that happened in the

01:03:34.164 --> 01:03:38.349
nineteenth century that advanced
information technology and made

01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:42.048
finance really powerful.
One was paper,

01:03:42.048 --> 01:03:46.873
it sounds very simple.
At the beginning of the

01:03:46.873 --> 01:03:50.794
nineteenth century,
in 1800, paper was handmade out

01:03:50.794 --> 01:03:54.010
of cloth--that's the way they
made it.

01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:57.360
Paper, therefore,
was very expensive.

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.494
So, if you bought a newspaper
it would be only two sheets

01:04:01.494 --> 01:04:06.220
because it was so expensive--not
all the thick paper that we have

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:10.059
today--and it would cost
something like $10 or $20 in

01:04:10.059 --> 01:04:13.294
today's prices.
It would only be wealthy people

01:04:13.294 --> 01:04:16.948
who would buy that everyday.
They invented the paper machine

01:04:16.948 --> 01:04:20.501
so they could mass-produce
paper--it didn't have to be

01:04:20.501 --> 01:04:24.255
handmade anymore--and they
invented wood pulp paper so it

01:04:24.255 --> 01:04:27.539
didn't have to be made out of
cloth anymore.

01:04:27.539 --> 01:04:31.106
The price of paper fell and
created opportunity for

01:04:31.106 --> 01:04:33.888
record-keeping,
which was very important

01:04:33.888 --> 01:04:37.811
because that's what finance is
built--you need financial

01:04:37.811 --> 01:04:40.489
records.
You can't have just one copy;

01:04:40.489 --> 01:04:42.350
you have to have multiple
copies.

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:50.416
They also invented carbon paper.
Maybe you don't even know what

01:04:50.416 --> 01:04:52.947
this--do you all know what
carbon paper--I guess you do

01:04:52.947 --> 01:04:54.260
know what this is,
right?

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.396
It's obsolete.
Do you have any carbon paper

01:04:57.396 --> 01:05:00.110
anyone, here in your room?
You do?

01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:05.355
Okay, so it's not obsolete.
Anyway, it's just paper with

01:05:05.355 --> 01:05:10.002
some black material on it.
You put it between two pieces

01:05:10.002 --> 01:05:13.519
of paper, then you write on the
top one and it creates as copy

01:05:13.519 --> 01:05:16.126
on the bottom one.
You can make multiple--you can

01:05:16.126 --> 01:05:18.827
put three or four--the copy gets
worse and worse each time,

01:05:18.827 --> 01:05:22.289
but you've got multiple copies.
That's information technology.

01:05:22.289 --> 01:05:26.384
You really need that because if
you have only one copy of

01:05:26.384 --> 01:05:29.090
something, you don't have a
backup;

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:31.969
so, you can store the one copy
separately.

01:05:31.969 --> 01:05:35.076
Also, in the nineteenth
century, the typewriter was

01:05:35.076 --> 01:05:39.486
invented.
Of course, that may be the core

01:05:39.486 --> 01:05:43.855
idea of a computer.
Your computer looks like a

01:05:43.855 --> 01:05:47.786
typewriter, but a typewriter
just speeds recording of

01:05:47.786 --> 01:05:50.645
information.
Tests show in the nineteenth

01:05:50.645 --> 01:05:54.280
century that people could type
four or five times as fast as

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:58.100
they could handwrite and there's
no ambiguity because it's very

01:05:58.100 --> 01:06:01.514
clear what key was struck;
whereas, handwritten--fast

01:06:01.514 --> 01:06:04.639
handwriting becomes impossible
to read--or difficult.

01:06:04.639 --> 01:06:07.502
Another thing that
happened--they started

01:06:07.502 --> 01:06:11.438
developing--it's not invented in
the nineteenth century,

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:14.730
but they started doing
standardized forms.

01:06:14.730 --> 01:06:18.871
That is, there would be a
printed form on paper with

01:06:18.871 --> 01:06:22.769
spaces to fill in the numbers or
other things.

01:06:22.769 --> 01:06:25.420
That put us at,
sort of, organization on the

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:29.575
data entry that was unknown.
You have this standardized form

01:06:29.575 --> 01:06:33.518
and you've got carbon paper
between them and you typed

01:06:33.518 --> 01:06:38.130
it--all these really created
much more accurate techniques.

01:06:38.130 --> 01:06:43.973
We also got better bureaucracy.
That means, we started to learn

01:06:43.973 --> 01:06:48.051
management science in the
government, so that

01:06:48.051 --> 01:06:52.685
government--and also in
corporations--so they could

01:06:52.685 --> 01:06:56.090
manage effectively.
In the United States,

01:06:56.090 --> 01:06:59.743
we developed the Civil Service.
It used to be that government

01:06:59.743 --> 01:07:03.385
officials were all picked by
political patronage and they,

01:07:03.385 --> 01:07:07.191
very often, were incompetent.
We set up--this is not a new

01:07:07.191 --> 01:07:10.590
idea, this goes back to China
thousands of years ago,

01:07:10.590 --> 01:07:14.992
but it started to be widely
done--a Civil Service exam that

01:07:14.992 --> 01:07:18.713
established your competence.
So, you had competent people

01:07:18.713 --> 01:07:20.880
with their typewriters and
carbon papers.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:26.672
Also, the filing cabinet--that
sounds like a minor thing--was

01:07:26.672 --> 01:07:29.778
invented in the 1890s.
Before that,

01:07:29.778 --> 01:07:33.591
people used to put papers in
piles, tie them up in ribbons,

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:36.550
and put them on bookshelves or
in drawers.

01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:40.969
The filing cabinet was much
more orderly and effective.

01:07:40.969 --> 01:07:45.130
So, all those things developed
in the nineteenth century.

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:55.070
It just created a new world for
financial opportunity.

01:07:55.070 --> 01:07:59.763
Things started to happen in
response to this and risk

01:07:59.763 --> 01:08:04.649
management got better.
I want to talk about Social

01:08:04.649 --> 01:08:10.693
Security as a risk management
technique that developed in the

01:08:10.693 --> 01:08:15.730
nineteenth century and it
developed in Germany.

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:19.239
It is very interesting to me
because it's a discrete

01:08:19.239 --> 01:08:23.092
invention that happened in a
point of time in response to

01:08:23.092 --> 01:08:26.062
information technology.
This is 1889,

01:08:26.062 --> 01:08:30.429
under the government of Otto
von Bismarck--although,

01:08:30.429 --> 01:08:37.531
he has nothing to do with this,
it was other people--economists

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:42.400
in Germany that invented this
idea.

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:46.304
What did they do?
I should have also mentioned

01:08:46.304 --> 01:08:49.755
another really important
information technology that

01:08:49.755 --> 01:08:53.949
developed in the nineteenth
century was the Postal Service,

01:08:53.949 --> 01:08:57.210
although we had mail before
then.

01:08:57.210 --> 01:09:01.856
In the nineteenth century they
decided--it just got really good

01:09:01.856 --> 01:09:05.324
at delivering mail.
In 1799, it would cost so much

01:09:05.324 --> 01:09:09.114
to mail a letter--I don't know
exactly, something like $10 or

01:09:09.114 --> 01:09:12.966
$20 to mail a letter at today's
rate--and it would take a long

01:09:12.966 --> 01:09:15.392
time get there.
For most people it was

01:09:15.392 --> 01:09:17.823
prohibitively--we're talking in
today's prices,

01:09:17.823 --> 01:09:20.614
roughly speaking.
Most people wouldn't ever mail

01:09:20.614 --> 01:09:24.142
a letter or get a letter--too
expensive, not to count only the

01:09:24.142 --> 01:09:26.340
paper and everything was
expensive.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:29.168
In the nineteenth century,
they developed the Postal

01:09:29.168 --> 01:09:31.720
Service and it interacted with
the railroad.

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:35.193
They started having mail cars
on trains and they started

01:09:35.193 --> 01:09:37.529
having postal sorting on the
train.

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:41.450
They were speeding the mail so
that it didn't have to wait to

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:45.240
sort it before it went on the
train--it was sorted while it

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.090
was moving on the train.
Germany was very effective in

01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:52.573
these--they had advanced
bureaucracy, a good postal

01:09:52.573 --> 01:09:55.214
service,
and they had a network of post

01:09:55.214 --> 01:09:58.462
offices all over the
country--every little town had a

01:09:58.462 --> 01:10:00.991
post office.
So, this was the internet of

01:10:00.991 --> 01:10:04.229
the nineteenth century and it
really changed everything.

01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:08.268
In 1889, the German Government
decided to use the postal

01:10:08.268 --> 01:10:11.865
service as an information
network to create Social

01:10:11.865 --> 01:10:14.436
Security.
They created a new law,

01:10:14.436 --> 01:10:18.584
which said that every person
who works in Germany has to pay

01:10:18.584 --> 01:10:22.100
the government a certain percent
of his income,

01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:26.064
into the Social Security system.
In addition,

01:10:26.064 --> 01:10:30.953
the employer has to match this
so that both the employer and

01:10:30.953 --> 01:10:35.019
the employee have to do it.
Now, how in the world can

01:10:35.019 --> 01:10:38.430
somebody actually make that work
for a whole country?

01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:42.036
There were eleven million
workers in Germany at the time

01:10:42.036 --> 01:10:44.659
and other countries looked on
this as,

01:10:44.659 --> 01:10:47.402
this is ridiculous,
no government can actually

01:10:47.402 --> 01:10:50.623
manage the system like this.
But, they did it through the

01:10:50.623 --> 01:10:52.931
postal system.
You had to make--or your

01:10:52.931 --> 01:10:56.706
employer can do it for you--they
take the money to the post

01:10:56.706 --> 01:11:00.090
office and the post office would
give you stamps.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:02.376
It was already the same
technology they used for the

01:11:02.376 --> 01:11:04.316
mail.
You kept your Social Security

01:11:04.316 --> 01:11:07.850
card and you pasted stamps on it
that proved that you paid it.

01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:11.093
They kept a copy of that and
they filed it away,

01:11:11.093 --> 01:11:14.889
so the government had a
complete record of your payments

01:11:14.889 --> 01:11:17.851
into the system.
The design was that,

01:11:17.851 --> 01:11:22.278
when you reached retirement
age, you would then get funds

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:27.100
from the government for the rest
of your life--your retirement

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:31.430
funds.
How did they decide how much?

01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:33.239
Well, it was based on what you
contributed.

01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:35.731
They would pull out your entire
life history of

01:11:35.731 --> 01:11:38.818
contributions--they had it
because you had filed it all at

01:11:38.818 --> 01:11:41.526
the post office and everything
was bureaucratic and

01:11:41.526 --> 01:11:44.738
efficient--and they calculated,
according to a formula,

01:11:44.738 --> 01:11:48.013
what you would get.
It was a real insurance system

01:11:48.013 --> 01:11:51.199
and they would pay you in your
retirement.

01:11:51.199 --> 01:11:54.852
The London Times,
in 1889, said this is going to

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:59.050
be a fiasco, there are going to
be so many mistakes,

01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:01.993
and there are going to be so
many complaints that this whole

01:12:01.993 --> 01:12:03.890
system is going to crumble and
fall;

01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:07.160
but it didn't,
it actually worked.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.402
Before long, the U.K. copied it.
The U.S.

01:12:10.402 --> 01:12:14.940
was practically the last
country to copy this system

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:19.479
because, in the 1930s,
it didn't sound American.

01:12:19.479 --> 01:12:23.765
We were kind of reluctant to
take on ideas from Germany,

01:12:23.765 --> 01:12:26.569
of all places,
but we finally did.

01:12:26.569 --> 01:12:29.799
We did that during the Great
Depression, when it suddenly

01:12:29.799 --> 01:12:32.510
seemed like we really needed to
do something.

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:35.372
That's an example;
you see how information

01:12:35.372 --> 01:12:38.449
technology created a Social
Security system.

01:12:38.449 --> 01:12:42.148
Now, the really fascinating
thing is that we have the same

01:12:42.148 --> 01:12:44.938
system today,
except we don't use the postal

01:12:44.938 --> 01:12:48.741
service as the conduit anymore.
Now it's all electronic and

01:12:48.741 --> 01:12:51.689
it's done by the Internet,
but it's the same thing.

01:12:51.689 --> 01:12:53.550
You will see,
deducted from your

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:57.270
paycheck--and you already have
seen this--it says FICA and then

01:12:57.270 --> 01:13:00.623
there's a certain amount,
a certain percentage of your

01:13:00.623 --> 01:13:03.908
paycheck, and the employer
matches just like in Germany in

01:13:03.908 --> 01:13:06.171
1889.
When you retire--you can

01:13:06.171 --> 01:13:08.798
actually get it now,
electronically,

01:13:08.798 --> 01:13:12.975
your entire employment history,
all your contributions--when

01:13:12.975 --> 01:13:16.344
you retire, there will be a
formula--you can find it on the

01:13:16.344 --> 01:13:19.247
Social Security system
website--which resembles the

01:13:19.247 --> 01:13:24.287
formula that they did in 1889.
We're still doing the same

01:13:24.287 --> 01:13:27.206
thing now.
This invention of social

01:13:27.206 --> 01:13:30.157
security is well over one
hundred years old,

01:13:30.157 --> 01:13:33.200
but I think that,
because of the rapid advance of

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.003
information technology,
we're going to see a lot more

01:13:36.003 --> 01:13:37.617
progress.
Over your lifetime,

01:13:37.617 --> 01:13:40.420
there are going to be a lot
more inventions like this.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:45.927
So, that's why I think finance
will be an interesting field for

01:13:45.927 --> 01:13:49.479
those of you who choose to go
into it.

01:13:49.479 --> 01:13:52.991
Finally, I just want to say,
next lecture is January

01:13:52.991 --> 01:13:56.572
twenty-eighth and we're going to
talk about portfolio

01:13:56.572 --> 01:13:59.450
diversification,
which is one very important

01:13:59.450 --> 01:14:02.840
application of the fundamental
principle of risk management,

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:07.717
as applied to securities.
It's more narrow than my very

01:14:07.717 --> 01:14:10.478
broad discussion.
It's not public finance,

01:14:10.478 --> 01:14:13.128
it's not insurance,
but it's one of the most

01:14:13.128 --> 01:14:16.640
important fundamental theories
that underlies finance.

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:20.036
Then you have a problem set,
which is due on that day,

01:14:20.036 --> 01:14:23.304
your first problem set,
and the problem set is up on

01:14:23.304 --> 01:14:26.473
the website.
If you go to ClassesV2 and you

01:14:26.473 --> 01:14:29.760
click on "Problem Sets," it's

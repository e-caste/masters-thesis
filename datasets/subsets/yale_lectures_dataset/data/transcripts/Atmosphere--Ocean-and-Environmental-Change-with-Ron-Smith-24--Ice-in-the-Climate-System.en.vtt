RONALD SMITH: As you know, because we
just got this subject started

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500
last time, I'm going to
talk today about ice

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500
in the climate system.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.567
Let me just review the
types of ice that

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:14.500
we'll be speaking about.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.133
Sea ice, which is
frozen seawater.

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:23.533
Ice sheets, which there's only
two of those existing today in

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.367
the modern world.

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:26.333
And that's Greenland
and Antarctica.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:27.767
We'll talk about those.

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.467
Later on, next week, when we
talk about climate change,

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:34.633
I'll describe to you how in
earlier days there were some

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:35.867
other ice sheets on Earth.

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:38.167
But at the moment there's
just those two.

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:40.233
We'll talk about
how they work.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:42.633
Glaciers, both coming down
from ice sheets and from

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.367
mountain glaciers.

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:47.467
Ice shelves, icebergs, and
permanent and seasonal

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:48.033
snowfields.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:51.800
So we'll be going through
those subjects today.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.900
And I mentioned these items
last time, as well.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.767
There are certain important
physical properties that

00:00:56.767 --> 00:01:01.900
you'll need to understand in
order to see--in order to

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.633
understand really how ice
behaves on our planet.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.767
And I won't go through
those again today.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.233
I went through them at the
beginning--at the end of the

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:12.167
period last time.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:13.800
But just review those.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.400
We'll be discussing
those as we go.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.567
So let's start with sea ice.

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.733
And what I've shown you here
are some diagrams that

00:01:26.733 --> 00:01:30.967
illustrate how sea ice changes
with season in the two

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:31.567
hemispheres.

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:33.567
Now remember, this is
frozen seawater.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:39.733
So about this time of year, late
October, you begin to get

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:44.500
cold air blowing over the
sea surface in the

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.733
high northern latitudes.

00:01:46.733 --> 00:01:49.900
So we'll focus on these
two diagrams.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.100
And as the cold air blows over
the ocean surface, it draws

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.000
heat out of the ocean,
cools it down.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.833
When you get the temperature
down to about what?

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:05.200
Not zero, but about minus two
Celsius, because the salt

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.233
depresses the freezing point by
that much, then you start

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.967
to get sea ice forming.

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:15.767
It starts usually in small
little patches of ice called

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:16.600
pancake ice.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.200
I'll show you that
in a minute.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.900
And then as the season
progresses, you freeze the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.967
water in between and
those little pieces

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:27.133
of ice stick together.

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:30.100
And a month or two later, you've
got a more or less

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.567
continuous layer of sea ice in
these high latitude regions.

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:37.400
And then during the winter,
it deepens.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.467
In other words, you're drawing
heat out of the bottom and

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:44.733
you're freezing more ocean
water onto the bottom.

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:49.033
So the thickness of the
sea ice increases.

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:52.333
So here we are in September,
which is at the end of the

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:53.100
warming season.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.333
That would be the minimum
in the sea ice.

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:58.233
And yet there is some sea
ice remaining from

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:00.733
the previous year.

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:03.533
Then we begin to build
new sea ice.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:08.367
And about six months later, this
is typically or at least

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:11.667
was--we'll talk about the fact
that it's changing with time.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:15.767
But this is typically how far
sea ice extends at the end of

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:17.867
the cooling season.

00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:19.633
Then it begins to warm again.

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.100
And over the summer, you melt
away a lot of this.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.100
And you end up back towards
the minimum.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.967
So there's a big seasonality
in sea ice.

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:29.867
And this is the way
we understand it.

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:32.500
In March, when you've got
maximum sea ice, you have a

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.200
stream of sea ice coming down on
the east side of Greenland.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.733
Most of Baffin Bay is
filled with sea ice.

00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:47.000
All of Hudson's Bay and James
Bay is filled with sea ice.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.400
And really, it even comes out a
bit into the North Pacific.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.667
But this area stays generally
free of sea ice.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.067
And you know why that is,
because you remember that

00:03:57.067 --> 00:04:01.033
the--part of the Gulf Stream
splits off and moves up into

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:01.567
that region.

00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:06.500
So even at the maximum of sea
ice, you still have open water

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.467
along the coast of Norway and
even up here in an area that's

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:12.700
called North Cape.

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:18.500
Now, of course, in the southern
hemisphere, the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.200
seasons are reversed.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.867
And so it's in March that you'll
have the minimum of sea

00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:27.867
ice, because that's when you're
at the end of the

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.067
warming season.

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:31.367
And it pretty much
drops to zero.

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:34.033
In other words, you have a
little bit of permanent sea

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:37.000
ice remaining, but really
very little.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.167
And then six months later, at
the end of the cooling season,

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:43.767
you've grown quite a remarkable
area of sea ice,

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:47.333
by, again, freezing seawater.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:49.600
Later on I'm going to be showing
you what the ice on

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.967
Antarctica is doing.

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:53.700
We'll talk about ice shelves.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.467
But keep that distinct from
what we're seeing here.

00:04:56.467 --> 00:05:00.067
This is the frozen seawater,
the sea ice that

00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:02.667
I'm referring to.

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:03.800
Any questions on that?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.167
Yes.

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:06.500
STUDENT: Is it because the Gulf
Stream waters are warmer,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.900
or they're just moving faster?

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.333
PROFESSOR: They're warmer.

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:13.400
So even in wintertime, the
temperature of the sea surface

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.867
here is about plus three
or plus four Celsius.

00:05:19.867 --> 00:05:22.000
And remember, the freezing
point is minus two.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.467
So you're not going to get
freezing of these waters, even

00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:28.533
though you get terrific
cold winds coming

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:31.867
off of that sea ice.

00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:34.400
I was on an expedition up there
20 years ago, right at

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.333
the edge of this sea ice,
looking at how that cold wind

00:05:39.333 --> 00:05:42.300
was coming off and trying
to freeze the water.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.133
But there was so much heat
convecting out of the water

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:47.700
that you weren't able to
cause any new sea ice

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.167
forming in that area.

00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:52.267
So it's the warmth of that Gulf
Stream extension that's

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:56.733
keeping that free of ice.

00:05:56.733 --> 00:05:57.500
Yes?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.800
STUDENT: How deep is the ice?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.833
PROFESSOR: I'll talk about that.

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:04.033
But typically, it's from--at
the end of the freezing

00:06:04.033 --> 00:06:08.900
season, you can freeze ice
about one meter deep.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.633
But if you mechanically stack
it up, which happens in some

00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:15.700
parts, you can get it to be
about the height of this room,

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.733
three or four meters high.

00:06:17.733 --> 00:06:19.967
So compared to the ocean depth,
it's tiny, just the

00:06:19.967 --> 00:06:21.733
thinnest skin.

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:25.667
But in terms of real physical
dimensions, I would say maybe

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:28.600
one meter at the end of the
cooling season, in some cases.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.933
Up to four where the
ice has been

00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:32.567
mechanically crushed and stacked.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.267
Now I want you to notice
something.

00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:43.533
In the Arctic Ocean, it's
ocean at the North Pole.

00:06:43.533 --> 00:06:45.733
And it's confined by
continent surround.

00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:48.033
And you typically
fill that up.

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:50.667
And you can't go any further,
of course, because you can't

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:53.000
make any sea ice
over the land.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.367
So if you're going to monitor
this sea ice year by year, the

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:02.300
way it's typically done in the
Northern Hemisphere is to

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.933
monitor the minimum sea ice,
which is in September.

00:07:07.933 --> 00:07:10.533
Maximum wouldn't make much
sense, because you're not

00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:11.833
going to fill that
in with ice.

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:14.433
And you've already taken
it shore to shore

00:07:14.433 --> 00:07:15.967
in the Arctic Ocean.

00:07:15.967 --> 00:07:19.300
So the way you monitor
interannual variations, or

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.867
trends, is to keep track
of the minimum.

00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:26.733
On the other hand, in the
Southern Hemisphere, the

00:07:26.733 --> 00:07:29.600
minimum is pretty much zero.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.067
It goes--you have a continent
filling the South Pole.

00:07:34.067 --> 00:07:36.833
And you're not going to form
any sea ice there.

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.600
And the sea ice itself
pretty much goes

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.967
back to that shoreline.

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:45.300
So the way we monitor sea ice
in the Southern Hemisphere

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.933
typically is by the maximum
sea ice that you grow.

00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:54.500
Notice, then, that that means
September is kind of the month

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.500
where we monitor sea ice in both
hemispheres, even though

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.467
the seasonality is opposite
in the two hemispheres.

00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:03.733
So be aware of that.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.333
It's a curious way
that we decide to

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:07.200
monitor these things.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.333
So pancake ice looks
like this.

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:12.633
So when the winter is beginning,
and the cold air is

00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:18.400
drawing heat out of the ocean,
for a period of some days or

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.533
weeks, you have little chunks
of ice that are from half a

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:25.067
meter to a couple meters
in diameter.

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:27.600
They have rounded edges, because
with the wave action,

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.967
they keep bouncing into
each other breaking

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:33.467
off any sharp corners.

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:36.067
And then a few weeks later you
begin to freeze and get a more

00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:37.467
continuous ice.

00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:39.667
This happens to be continuous
sea ice

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:41.267
with compression ridges.

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:44.067
In other words, when you look at
these features like this or

00:08:44.067 --> 00:08:48.167
that, that's an area where the
wind has blown the sea ice

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:53.533
together and it has crumpled
along a line.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:59.533
And so if you're traveling over
sea ice, as the early

00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:02.800
explorers were trying to do,
travel over the sea ice to

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.800
reach the North Pole, it's not
like some skating rink where

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.633
you can just ski or skate
across the sea ice.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:14.667
In fact, every few hundred
meters, you end up climbing

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:19.167
over one of these compression
ridges, which makes traveling

00:09:19.167 --> 00:09:21.500
there extremely difficult.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.633
You have to pull your sledges or
whatever kind of equipment

00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:27.300
you have up over these
ridges and then down.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.167
You get maybe 50 or 100
yards, and then

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:30.033
you're doing it again.

00:09:30.033 --> 00:09:32.733
So it's very rough going
when you're trying to

00:09:32.733 --> 00:09:33.533
cross the sea ice.

00:09:33.533 --> 00:09:33.867
Yes?

00:09:33.867 --> 00:09:35.700
STUDENT: How tall do
the ridges get?

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:40.367
PROFESSOR: So the
ridges will get typically only

00:09:40.367 --> 00:09:42.933
four or five meters high.

00:09:42.933 --> 00:09:46.300
But remember, they've got a
root which you don't see.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.000
But in order to support that
extra weight, they also have a

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.533
root that goes down
beneath the ice.

00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:56.300
So if you measured it from top
to bottom, it might be 20 or

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.067
30 meters, but the part you have
to climb over is just 3

00:10:00.067 --> 00:10:01.667
or 4 meters, something
like that.

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:02.100
Yes?

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.433
STUDENT: How are they formed?

00:10:03.433 --> 00:10:05.300
PROFESSOR: By compression.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.933
So the wind, for example,
blowing over the ice will try

00:10:08.933 --> 00:10:10.267
to push it.

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:13.033
But if it comes up against a
shoreline, it can't be pushed

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:14.167
any further.

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:17.200
And so you'll end up just
crumpling that ice and

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.900
stacking it up along
these ridges.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.233
Yeah.

00:10:21.233 --> 00:10:23.333
Good questions.

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:27.567
So here's another picture
of sea ice.

00:10:27.567 --> 00:10:30.267
And I wanted to ask you, first
of all, was this picture taken

00:10:30.267 --> 00:10:34.433
in winter or summer
would you guess?

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:35.200
STUDENT: Summer?

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.433
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:42.100
It was taken in summer.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.800
How would you know that?

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.567
STUDENT: The ice isn't
continuous?

00:10:45.567 --> 00:10:46.033
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:10:46.033 --> 00:10:47.800
STUDENT: So the ice
isn't continuous?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:47.867
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:49.867
It's got some melt water
in between here.

00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:52.267
But there's even a more obvious
answer than that.

00:10:52.267 --> 00:10:54.533
STUDENT: Do they hibernate
in the winter?

00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:55.433
PROFESSOR: That's true also.

00:10:55.433 --> 00:10:59.000
But there's even a more obvious
answer than that.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.600
STUDENT: The sunlight.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.700
PROFESSOR: It's sunlit.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.300
Exactly.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:03.567
So you could not take a picture
like that in the

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:04.133
winter time.

00:11:04.133 --> 00:11:05.733
It would be pitch dark.

00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:07.333
So it is true it is melt ice.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.667
It is true the polar bears
walking around.

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:13.967
But even more obvious is it's
sunlit, so that means in those

00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:17.400
latitudes that's got to be
a summertime picture.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.700
Just a trick question for
you this morning.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:21.067
Seeing if you're awake.

00:11:21.067 --> 00:11:24.867
So let's take a look
at what happens.

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:27.400
This is a short movie.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.333
And it'll just show you remember
the date is up here.

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:33.567
And you'll watch that change.

00:11:33.567 --> 00:11:37.233
And so we'll just watch
how one season's

00:11:37.233 --> 00:11:39.467
sea ice grows here.

00:11:39.467 --> 00:11:46.467
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:49.400
PROFESSOR: So it's growing now,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.500
filling out the basin.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.233
Look what's happening
in Hudson's Bay.

00:11:53.233 --> 00:11:55.033
Filling in James Bay too.

00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:56.867
Still growing a bit up here.

00:11:56.867 --> 00:11:59.300
But it's now about as far
as it's going to get.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:02.033
A little bit of extra growth
there in Baffin Bay.

00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:04.400
A little bit more growth,
though, in the current

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.167
bringing it down.

00:12:05.167 --> 00:12:05.300
[END  VIDEO  PLAYBACK]

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.567
PROFESSOR: And then
there we are in March.

00:12:06.567 --> 00:12:08.367
So that's kind of
at the maximum.

00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:12.700
The movie just takes you from
minimum to maximum last year,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.067
in the year 2010.

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:18.400
Now what will happen after that,
not shown, is that this

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.633
will all began to melt back.

00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:24.000
And we'll end up back towards
that minimum September

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.267
distribution.

00:12:28.633 --> 00:12:31.067
Let me play that again, just
so you can-- in case you

00:12:31.067 --> 00:12:32.500
missed something.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.367
Every place you look
at you see a little

00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:35.967
different story there.

00:12:35.967 --> 00:12:37.300
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.300
PROFESSOR: Also, the
zooming in is distracting a

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.533
little bit.

00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:54.633
The shade of white gives you
something about the thickness

00:12:54.633 --> 00:12:56.700
or the continuity
of the sea ice.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.533
If there's gaps, that will show
up as a slightly darker

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:01.933
shade of gray.

00:13:01.933 --> 00:13:04.800
[END  VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.300
PROFESSOR: So Rachel
asked about thickness.

00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:12.900
Here's some examples.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.700
The mean, from 1982 to 2000 now
it's difficult to measure

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.433
ice thickness.

00:13:17.433 --> 00:13:21.000
There are various
ways to do it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.267
The earliest way was to
take a submarine.

00:13:23.267 --> 00:13:26.667
In the late '60s they finally
got nuclear submarines that

00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:29.000
could pass under
the ice sheet.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.200
And then with an up-looking
sonar you could measure the

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.700
bottom and the top of the
ice and get a thickness

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.167
measurement that way.

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:40.100
Of course, you can go there in
situ, but then how do you--you

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.900
want to get some measurement
that's kind of representative

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.267
of a large area.

00:13:44.267 --> 00:13:46.867
It's hard to do that if you're
just walking around on the ice

00:13:46.867 --> 00:13:48.667
with some kind of way
of drilling through.

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:54.933
So now there's a way to fly over
it, and use down-scanning

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:58.800
atmospheric acoustic waves or
electromagnetic waves to

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.600
measure sea ice thickness
as well.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.300
So it's not a perfectly
solved problem.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:04.467
But this will give
you some idea.

00:14:04.467 --> 00:14:05.967
The scale is down
on the bottom.

00:14:05.967 --> 00:14:09.067
It's in meters, from zero
to four meters.

00:14:09.067 --> 00:14:13.767
And it's all over on the north
slope of Canada--north slope

00:14:13.767 --> 00:14:17.100
of Alaska and then along the
Canadian Archipelago where you

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.667
get this deeper ice.

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:24.700
And that, I've made the case for
you, is not you can't grow

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:28.467
ice that thick
thermodynamically, by freezing

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:28.933
at the bottom.

00:14:28.933 --> 00:14:32.333
Because after it gets to a
certain thickness, remember

00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:34.700
you have to take the
heat out the top.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.333
That's where the atmosphere
is cold.

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:39.367
And yet you've got to freeze
the water at the bottom.

00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:42.033
And after a while, it becomes
too hard to get that heat to

00:14:42.033 --> 00:14:44.133
conduct out through that
layer of sea ice.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:48.400
So you can only grow sea ice
thermodynamically to this kind

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.133
of thickness.

00:14:49.133 --> 00:14:51.733
This is a mechanical
stacking process.

00:14:51.733 --> 00:14:54.200
And you can understand that if
you remember that across the

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.433
Arctic Ocean there is
a current called

00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:58.933
the Transpolar Drift.

00:14:58.933 --> 00:15:00.400
And also the Beaufort Gyre.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:03.833
But that's going to be carrying
ice and pushing it up

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:07.000
against the north coast of
Greenland and along the

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.033
Canadian Archipelago, and then
causing that compression ridge

00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:13.167
to form, those compression
ridges.

00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:18.567
And that deepens the average ice
thickness to as great as

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:21.667
four meters, in other words,
typically a little higher than

00:15:21.667 --> 00:15:24.600
the ceiling in this room.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.867
Questions on that?

00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:33.200
So here's what's been going on
the last couple of decades.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.367
So this is the Northern
Hemisphere extent anomaly.

00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:42.667
Remember we're learning to
understand this word anomaly,

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:45.833
because it's often used
in climate analysis.

00:15:45.833 --> 00:15:48.200
What they do is take a
measurement and then subtract

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:52.367
off a mean value to just
emphasize the changes that

00:15:52.367 --> 00:15:53.400
have occurred.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.567
And this is expressed
in percent.

00:15:55.567 --> 00:15:56.567
And zero is here.

00:15:56.567 --> 00:15:58.300
So they've taken a year.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:04.700
They've taken 1979 to the year
2000 as their reference time,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.867
subtracted off the mean, and
then here's what's left as the

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:11.100
residual or as the anomaly.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:14.800
So basically, in the earlier
part of the time it was--had a

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.433
positive anomaly by definition,
as it's

00:16:18.433 --> 00:16:19.067
decreasing.

00:16:19.067 --> 00:16:21.733
And then near the end you
get a negative anomaly.

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:25.833
So really the change has
been remarkable.

00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:30.567
Overall that's about a 40% if
you count this, maybe even a

00:16:30.567 --> 00:16:36.267
50% decrease in the area covered
by ice in September.

00:16:36.267 --> 00:16:41.100
That's in the minimum period,
after the warming season.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.200
There was quite a shock, and
you read about this in the

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.767
newspaper perhaps,
back in 2007.

00:16:46.767 --> 00:16:50.533
We had this remarkable drop
in sea ice extent

00:16:50.533 --> 00:16:52.000
in the Arctic Ocean.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.700
Then it rebounded.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:55.000
And people were saying,
well, maybe

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.300
that was just an anomaly.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.667
Well, it was an anomaly.

00:16:57.667 --> 00:16:59.100
But now it's come down again.

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.333
So the point is it's been
noisy all along.

00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:05.000
But nevertheless the
trend, the downward

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.700
trend is very clear.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.933
And what I would expect to
happen in the future, it would

00:17:08.933 --> 00:17:13.167
decline further, but be very
noisy from year to year.

00:17:13.167 --> 00:17:16.200
And you can extrapolate
this for yourself.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.867
In another 20 or 30 years, it
seems like we'll have an

00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:26.600
ice-free Arctic Ocean at the
end of the warming season.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.833
Questions on that?

00:17:30.067 --> 00:17:35.267
So the Southern Hemisphere,
again September.

00:17:35.267 --> 00:17:37.200
This is the maximum,
because the minimum

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.133
doesn't make any sense.

00:17:38.133 --> 00:17:40.733
It pulls right back pretty
much to the shores of

00:17:40.733 --> 00:17:41.733
Antarctica.

00:17:41.733 --> 00:17:42.900
That's pretty flat.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.067
Or, if you looked at it very
closely, it's even increasing

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:48.300
ever so slightly.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.200
And so this trend in sea ice
that we see in the Northern

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.500
Hemisphere is not found in
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.667
When we're talking about things
like global warming,

00:17:57.667 --> 00:18:03.500
we'll come back and refer to
measurements such as this one.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.800
But remember, this has a
somewhat different meaning,

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:09.867
because this is the maximum
extent of sea ice.

00:18:09.867 --> 00:18:13.867
Whereas the other one, for the
Northern Arctic Ocean was the

00:18:13.867 --> 00:18:15.833
minimum extent of sea ice.

00:18:15.833 --> 00:18:17.067
Any questions on that?

00:18:19.467 --> 00:18:24.433
And of course what's also in
the news is that now, as in

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:29.433
the Arctic Ocean, you get a
retreat of that minimum sea

00:18:29.433 --> 00:18:31.333
ice in September.

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:36.333
You've opened up these
two long-sought

00:18:36.333 --> 00:18:38.333
navigational routes.

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:42.533
For years and years in the
17th and 18th and 19th

00:18:42.533 --> 00:18:46.467
centuries, sailors were seeking
the Northwest Passage,

00:18:46.467 --> 00:18:48.700
trying to find a way to get
between the Atlantic and the

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.033
Pacific without going all
the way under Cape Horn.

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:53.867
And this is what they
were trying to do.

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:56.500
They never achieved it,
but now today you can.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:59.567
There is a month or so in the
summer when you can take a

00:18:59.567 --> 00:19:05.233
ship through the Canadian
Archipelago free of ice and

00:19:05.233 --> 00:19:06.700
transport back and forth.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:14.133
And in the last well, at least
in 2007, and in this year,

00:19:14.133 --> 00:19:17.233
there's actually a northern
sea route along the north

00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:21.267
coast of Russia that you could
use also to get back and forth

00:19:21.267 --> 00:19:23.333
between the two oceans.

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:26.900
So navigation is now becoming
possible in the Arctic Ocean.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.567
And so is things like
oil drilling.

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:31.933
So there's been a lot of
discussion about who's going

00:19:31.933 --> 00:19:36.833
to lead the charge to now
developing oil resources in

00:19:36.833 --> 00:19:37.900
the Arctic Ocean.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.967
It's quite a change
going on up there.

00:19:41.967 --> 00:19:43.633
So any questions on sea ice?

00:19:43.633 --> 00:19:46.167
This was all about
frozen seawater.

00:19:46.167 --> 00:19:47.967
Any questions on that?

00:19:47.967 --> 00:19:48.867
Yes, Julia

00:19:48.867 --> 00:19:49.300
STUDENT: Can you quickly review
how the wind--is it

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.567
convection?

00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:54.333
PROFESSOR: Yes,
so the cold wind

00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:55.967
blows over the sea.

00:19:55.967 --> 00:20:00.067
It draws heat out of the ocean,
drops the temperature

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:03.333
down to zero degrees Celsius,
then below, down

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:04.833
to minus two Celsius.

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:07.900
And at that point then,
you start to freeze.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.233
And of course, I showed you on
the first slide, you've got to

00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:15.267
draw certain amount of heat out
for every kilogram of ice

00:20:15.267 --> 00:20:16.567
that you make.

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:18.333
That's called the latent
heat of freezing.

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:21.633
So as you continue to draw
heat out, the temperature

00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:25.067
doesn't drop anymore, but you
continue to build deeper and

00:20:25.067 --> 00:20:26.467
deeper ice.

00:20:26.467 --> 00:20:29.600
So that continues through the
month of March in the Northern

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.867
Hemisphere.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.367
So now we turn to ice sheets,
which is generally defined as

00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:42.833
a large plateau of ice.

00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:46.467
And there's two things
you have to know

00:20:46.467 --> 00:20:47.333
to understand this.

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:50.267
First of all, on the high
altitude parts of the ice

00:20:50.267 --> 00:20:52.533
sheet this happens to be
Greenland, but it would be the

00:20:52.533 --> 00:20:56.700
same for Antarctica you have
an excess of accumulation

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.233
every year.

00:20:58.233 --> 00:21:03.633
So more snow falls during the
winter than would melt off if

00:21:03.633 --> 00:21:06.400
indeed there's any melt at
all in the summertime.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.300
And so year after year,
you just accumulate.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.867
Well, that can't
go on forever.

00:21:11.867 --> 00:21:17.533
I mean, if you accumulated a
meter of snow or 10 meters of

00:21:17.533 --> 00:21:22.000
snow every year, by the time
you got to 10 years or 100

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.067
years or 1,000 years or 10,000
years, you would have an

00:21:25.067 --> 00:21:26.967
enormous pile of snow.

00:21:26.967 --> 00:21:28.600
So you have to balance that.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.133
And what happens is that,
under its own weight, it

00:21:31.133 --> 00:21:34.667
begins to sag and to flow.

00:21:34.667 --> 00:21:38.900
So the snow gets compressed into
more or less solid ice.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.733
And then that ice itself, under
high pressure conditions

00:21:42.733 --> 00:21:46.833
with a lot of weight above it,
will begin to flow out toward

00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:49.500
the edges of the continent.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:52.200
You can simulate this next time
you've got pancakes for

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.633
breakfast. Just keep pouring
that syrup right in the middle

00:21:55.633 --> 00:21:58.233
the pancake, and it
only get so deep.

00:21:58.233 --> 00:22:01.933
After a while it begins
to flow off the edges.

00:22:01.933 --> 00:22:03.200
And that's exactly
what's happening.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:09.933
It's just gravity forcing that
viscous fluid toward the edges

00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:11.667
of the pancake.

00:22:11.667 --> 00:22:16.000
Then near the edge, there could
be some loss by melting

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.800
or direct sublimation.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:23.967
Sublimation is when you go
directly from ice to vapor.

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:26.533
But if that's not sufficient,
then the ice will actually be

00:22:26.533 --> 00:22:29.267
squeezed out and will
reach the ocean.

00:22:29.267 --> 00:22:34.933
And then you'll break off those
chunks as icebergs.

00:22:34.933 --> 00:22:38.067
But in any case, you've got to
balance the mass by having

00:22:38.067 --> 00:22:42.233
this flow moving from the
center towards the edge.

00:22:42.233 --> 00:22:45.667
And that's the way
ice sheets work.

00:22:45.667 --> 00:22:47.233
That speed is not very great.

00:22:47.233 --> 00:22:53.133
It may be only a meter per day
or even a meter per week.

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:55.467
Those flows can be quite slow.

00:22:55.467 --> 00:23:00.133
But nevertheless, they balance
this annual accumulation of

00:23:00.133 --> 00:23:04.467
snow on the high parts
of the ice sheet.

00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:07.900
You can imagine then, if you
have this spreading going on,

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.033
there has to be some kind of a
divide, just like when we did

00:23:12.033 --> 00:23:16.133
the river trip, we understood
that there is a divide between

00:23:16.133 --> 00:23:17.733
water sheds.

00:23:17.733 --> 00:23:20.767
Rain that falls on one side
goes into one river.

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:23.300
Rain that falls on the other
side goes into another river.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.767
The same is true with ice.

00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:27.967
It's called an ice divide, so
that the snowflake that falls

00:23:27.967 --> 00:23:30.967
here will end up being squeezed
out towards the west

00:23:30.967 --> 00:23:31.867
coast of Greenland.

00:23:31.867 --> 00:23:35.333
A snowflake that falls there
will be squeezed out towards

00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:37.467
the east coast and the
north and so on.

00:23:37.467 --> 00:23:39.533
And Antarctica has
similar divides.

00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:41.433
They're drawn here.

00:23:41.433 --> 00:23:43.500
There's quite a number
of them, actually.

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:47.333
But each snowflake then will
be squeezed out ultimately

00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:51.400
towards one part of the coast
or the other depending where

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:56.500
they fall relative to
these ice divides.

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.733
Any questions on that?

00:24:01.767 --> 00:24:04.000
So when you're up on the
Greenland ice sheet,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.467
it looks like this.

00:24:06.467 --> 00:24:09.500
More or less continuous
sheets of deep ice.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.667
There may be a kilometer or
more of ice beneath you.

00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:15.933
Very deep ice.

00:24:15.933 --> 00:24:19.833
Occasionally you may get a rocky
outcrop, a so-called

00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:22.933
nunatak, where a mountain
ridge sticks

00:24:22.933 --> 00:24:24.667
up through the ice.

00:24:24.667 --> 00:24:27.500
But for the most part, there's
very deep ice, maybe a

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.767
kilometer or two of
ice beneath you.

00:24:31.767 --> 00:24:35.667
And you don't have any sense of
that slow creeping motion,

00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:37.667
at least not here where
it's smooth.

00:24:41.267 --> 00:24:47.033
When the ice squeezes out to the
edge, in some places when

00:24:47.033 --> 00:24:51.500
it reaches the sea it'll
maintain its continuity as an

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.867
ice sheet, but spread out and
begin to float over the sea.

00:24:55.867 --> 00:24:57.967
Those are called ice shelves.

00:24:57.967 --> 00:25:00.467
And I've shown you the dominant
ice shelves here for

00:25:00.467 --> 00:25:01.833
Antarctica.

00:25:01.833 --> 00:25:07.133
There's the Ross ice shelf,
the Ronne, and the Larsen.

00:25:07.133 --> 00:25:10.900
And here's a zoom of the
Antarctic Peninsula showing

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.367
the Larsen ice sheet there.

00:25:14.367 --> 00:25:19.900
So while that's floating out
over the ocean surface, do not

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.800
confuse it with sea ice.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.500
It is still compacted snow.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.667
It's fresh water in compacted
snow that's flowing out and

00:25:28.667 --> 00:25:31.500
floating over the ocean,
being squeezed off the

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.900
continent in that way.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.767
So it looks like this.

00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:40.867
At least the part you can
see looks like this.

00:25:40.867 --> 00:25:45.033
But remember, there's
another 90% or so.

00:25:45.033 --> 00:25:47.667
Most of it is beneath the
water's surface because of

00:25:47.667 --> 00:25:49.733
buoyancy considerations.

00:25:49.733 --> 00:25:52.400
But that's an example
of an ice shelf, a

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.200
thick layer of ice.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.967
Here's a ship for scale.

00:25:55.967 --> 00:26:00.400
And basically, the ice is
attached to the land.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.667
But eventually as it flows off
it gets water underneath.

00:26:04.667 --> 00:26:06.000
It floats up.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.067
Remember, ice is less dense than
water, so it floats on

00:26:10.067 --> 00:26:14.200
the water and flows on
out as an ice shelf.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.000
And then eventually it breaks
off to form icebergs.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.800
Questions there?

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.100
Now, back in 19--in 2002, it
was in the news that the

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.800
Larsen ice shelf, or part
of it, had collapsed.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.167
So here's a sequence of
satellite images.

00:26:31.167 --> 00:26:35.767
January, 2002, February, late
February, and then March.

00:26:35.767 --> 00:26:38.033
So here is the Larsen
ice shelf.

00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:41.167
Remember, that's on the coast
of the Antarctic Peninsula.

00:26:41.167 --> 00:26:43.133
I just showed that to you.

00:26:43.133 --> 00:26:46.667
It looks like there's already
some weakening going on here.

00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:51.167
But then over the next month or
so, most of that broke away

00:26:51.167 --> 00:26:54.833
and floated on off
as icebergs.

00:26:54.833 --> 00:27:00.200
There's some argument in the
scientific literature about

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.867
the significance of the
sudden loss of an

00:27:03.867 --> 00:27:05.233
ice shelf like this.

00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:07.567
Some would say, well, it doesn't
really mean anything,

00:27:07.567 --> 00:27:10.433
because that ice has already
left the continent.

00:27:10.433 --> 00:27:13.533
It's already floating
over the sea.

00:27:13.533 --> 00:27:15.967
And it'll be replaced.

00:27:15.967 --> 00:27:18.267
In other words, in the natural
flow of things, even in a

00:27:18.267 --> 00:27:22.767
steady state climate, this ice
has to be replaced by new ice

00:27:22.767 --> 00:27:24.000
coming off the land.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.800
Others would say, no, a
catastrophic loss like this

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:31.767
will actually have an effect
back over the land.

00:27:31.767 --> 00:27:35.567
And will accelerate the rate at
which glaciers are flowing

00:27:35.567 --> 00:27:37.667
off the land onto the sea.

00:27:37.667 --> 00:27:41.367
So that argument's a little
bit unresolved, but there

00:27:41.367 --> 00:27:44.967
probably is some climatic
significance when you see a

00:27:44.967 --> 00:27:48.000
sudden collapse of an
ice shelf like that.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.800
But it can be argued one
way or the other.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.033
Questions there?

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:02.033
Greenland doesn't have much
in the way of ice shelves.

00:28:02.033 --> 00:28:03.733
There's glaciers being produced

00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:06.133
all along both coasts.

00:28:06.133 --> 00:28:08.533
But there's an area up here,
called the Petermann Glacier

00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:15.433
that it might be argued has the
nature of an ice shelf.

00:28:15.433 --> 00:28:16.633
There's the Petermann glacier.

00:28:16.633 --> 00:28:18.033
It certainly looks like that.

00:28:18.033 --> 00:28:20.867
It's got a broad,
flat appearance.

00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:24.333
It's floating at this point.

00:28:24.333 --> 00:28:27.467
I'll show you the geometry
of that here.

00:28:27.467 --> 00:28:28.067
So here we are.

00:28:28.067 --> 00:28:31.700
We're up in the northwest
corner of Greenland.

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.100
There's some barren land
with no ice on it.

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.633
But here comes a glacial
stream, coming down

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:40.933
from the ice sheet.

00:28:40.933 --> 00:28:43.567
And at some point, it does
float out over water.

00:28:43.567 --> 00:28:50.133
And while it is confined to a
fjord, it is floating as a

00:28:50.133 --> 00:28:52.267
more or less continuous
ice sheet.

00:28:52.267 --> 00:28:54.567
And so I guess even though it's
confined, it could be

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:58.167
called an ice shelf.

00:28:58.167 --> 00:29:01.500
And then it will have a point
where it breaks off and

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.200
becomes icebergs
at that point.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.600
And back just last year, in
2010, this was in the news,

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.967
that a big chunk--between July
and August of last year, a big

00:29:15.967 --> 00:29:18.367
chunk of the Petermann
Glacier broke off.

00:29:18.367 --> 00:29:22.867
And then this big flat, huge,
tabular iceberg drifted

00:29:22.867 --> 00:29:29.100
northwest into the Strait of
Nares and ended up blocking

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.767
that channel for a
number of months.

00:29:36.267 --> 00:29:40.400
We're going to right on
to icebergs then.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.167
OK.

00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:43.367
Here's what you need to know.

00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:48.333
The word--the verb for what
happens when you take a

00:29:48.333 --> 00:29:50.833
floating chunk of ice and
break it off to form an

00:29:50.833 --> 00:29:52.700
iceberg is called calve.

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:57.800
So we say that icebergs are
formed from calving.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.967
That can be either from mountain
glaciers that have

00:29:59.967 --> 00:30:02.833
come down to the sea, or I've
just given you several

00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:07.267
examples of where ice sheet
glaciers come down to the sea.

00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:10.100
And then pieces can break
off to form icebergs.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.567
Once they're floating, they
drift under the influence of

00:30:13.567 --> 00:30:16.667
wind and ocean currents.

00:30:16.667 --> 00:30:20.433
And don't forget to indicate
that the Coriolis force can

00:30:20.433 --> 00:30:22.100
also play a big role
in this too.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.600
For example, if the wind pushes
on an iceberg in that

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:29.600
direction, it'll move
off at right angles.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.233
So that's because of
the Coriolis force.

00:30:33.233 --> 00:30:37.533
They float with about 90% of
their volume under water.

00:30:37.533 --> 00:30:41.800
We'll work out the math for
that in just a moment.

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.900
That means there's a lot
of ice underneath

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.167
that you don't see.

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:49.200
And if you're in a shallow part
of the ocean, they can

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.833
hit the bottom and get stuck.

00:30:52.833 --> 00:30:55.400
So very often you'll find
icebergs that are not moving,

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.700
even though the wind is pushing
on them and the

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.967
current is pushing on them.

00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:01.167
But they're just
stuck in place.

00:31:01.167 --> 00:31:04.700
That would have to be because
their bottom is touching.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.933
So they get stuck there.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.800
They tend to melt the fastest
right around their water line.

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.000
Right where the waves splash
up against them you tend to

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.533
get this rapid melting right
around the water line.

00:31:20.533 --> 00:31:24.333
What that will do is change the
shape of these icebergs by

00:31:24.333 --> 00:31:28.467
carving away these grooves
around the water line.

00:31:28.467 --> 00:31:32.133
And at some point, their shape
changes so much that their

00:31:32.133 --> 00:31:35.467
current orientation is
no longer stable.

00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:39.433
And then, without warning, these
things will suddenly

00:31:39.433 --> 00:31:41.100
begin to tip.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.267
And they'll roll to a new
orientation and then stay that

00:31:45.267 --> 00:31:48.933
way for several weeks while
melting continues around their

00:31:48.933 --> 00:31:51.800
new water line.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.033
And that's rather remarkable.

00:31:53.033 --> 00:31:56.800
If you get a chance to visit
these latitudes and if you see

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.733
a broad field of icebergs, and
if you're patient and wait a

00:32:00.733 --> 00:32:03.333
few minutes, because there's
so many of them, you'll

00:32:03.333 --> 00:32:06.900
probably see one or two
of them do that roll.

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.533
And that's the reason
why you don't want

00:32:08.533 --> 00:32:09.367
to be close to them.

00:32:09.367 --> 00:32:11.867
Because when they roll, they'll
put off a wave. And

00:32:11.867 --> 00:32:14.467
they would swamp you if you're
in a small boat.

00:32:14.467 --> 00:32:20.200
That'll happen suddenly,
without any warning.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.533
So I want to show this
little calving movie.

00:32:22.533 --> 00:32:24.900
I found it on the web.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.533
And I want to be sure
the sound is here.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.433
Let's see if I can
get this to work.

00:32:38.267 --> 00:32:51.133
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

-Oh, look at it go.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600
Oh my gosh.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.067

a picture of that.

Woo-hoo.

00:33:10.067 --> 00:33:11.567
Look at all that.

00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:18.033
Fabulous.

00:33:18.033 --> 00:33:20.000
I'm glad we're not
next to that.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Holy cow.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.500
Oh my gosh.

00:33:28.967 --> 00:33:30.467
-I can feel that.

00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:32.433
-Oh my gosh.

00:33:35.433 --> 00:33:36.667
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:47.333 --> 00:33:49.267
Oh my gosh.

00:33:49.267 --> 00:33:51.867
[END  VIDEO  PLAYBACK]

00:33:51.867 --> 00:33:53.333
PROFESSOR: I don't
know what happened after that.

00:33:56.733 --> 00:33:59.200
So that's the calving process.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.067
So that ice has come out.

00:34:01.067 --> 00:34:03.900
And then eventually it has
to break off pieces.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.967
And it happens kind
of in a dramatic

00:34:06.967 --> 00:34:10.933
fashion, as you saw there.

00:34:10.933 --> 00:34:15.167
So from that bit of fun to the
mathematics of the situation.

00:34:15.167 --> 00:34:18.000
So remember, Archimedes law.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.567
We've talked about it before
in this course.

00:34:19.567 --> 00:34:23.200
It basically says that the
buoyancy force pushing up on a

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:28.833
submerged obstacle--submerged
object is equal to the weight

00:34:28.833 --> 00:34:32.467
of the fluid displaced.

00:34:32.467 --> 00:34:37.367
So when you have an object like
this, like an iceberg,

00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:40.267
floating in a stable
configuration, there's going

00:34:40.267 --> 00:34:44.500
to be a balance of its own
weight with the buoyancy force

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.033
pushing it up.

00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:48.967
So I've left the acceleration of
gravity off of both terms,

00:34:48.967 --> 00:34:50.833
but that would be the
same in both cases.

00:34:50.833 --> 00:35:00.333
So the weight would be the total
volume of the iceberg

00:35:00.333 --> 00:35:02.467
times the density of ice.

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:05.967
That product will give you
the mass in kilograms

00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:08.733
of the total iceberg.

00:35:08.733 --> 00:35:12.067
And then that's going to be
balanced by a buoyancy force

00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:16.433
pushing up, which is the volume
submerged it's only

00:35:16.433 --> 00:35:21.467
this part multiplied
by the density

00:35:21.467 --> 00:35:23.433
of the fluid displaced.

00:35:23.433 --> 00:35:26.433
Well, it's displacing
seawater.

00:35:26.433 --> 00:35:28.200
So we use the density
of seawater.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.367
So that's the statement
of equilibrium for

00:35:32.367 --> 00:35:35.700
this floating object.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:41.067
If I simply divide through,
I can get this expression.

00:35:41.067 --> 00:35:46.267
The ratio of the submerged part
of the iceberg to the

00:35:46.267 --> 00:35:50.833
total is simply going to be
dividing through the ratio of

00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:55.400
the two densities, rho ice
over rho of seawater.

00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.967
And we've already used
these values before.

00:35:57.967 --> 00:36:02.167
The density of ice is about 917
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:36:02.167 --> 00:36:05.300
Seawater, with the salt,
is about 1,025.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.833
Divide that out, you get 0.9.

00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:12.467
So the point is the ratio of
this part to the total is

00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:15.033
about 0.9, or 90%.

00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:24.067
So that is a solid derivation of
why it is that most of the

00:36:24.067 --> 00:36:27.167
iceberg is below sea
level there.

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:28.400
Any questions on that?

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.067
Now, a very interesting place on
the west coast of Greenland

00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:38.300
is Jacobshaven.

00:36:40.467 --> 00:36:43.500
So here is the ice sheet, the
Greenland Ice Sheet out to the

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:48.800
east. There's Baffin Bay to
the west. And the glacier

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800
comes down here.

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.333
But here is indicated where
that calving front was in

00:36:54.333 --> 00:36:59.000
1851, 1875, and back to 2003.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.067
So it's been retreating
rather dramatically.

00:37:03.067 --> 00:37:05.200
But I want to make something
clear to you, that even when

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.800
this retreats all the way back
here this is where the calving

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.833
is now taking place still,
this channel

00:37:11.833 --> 00:37:13.100
is choked with ice.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.067
It's not open water.

00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:17.867
It's got lots of icebergs
sitting in it, some of them

00:37:17.867 --> 00:37:19.167
making their way out.

00:37:19.167 --> 00:37:23.233
Some of them grounded and
kind of stuck there.

00:37:23.233 --> 00:37:25.867
But the calving front
is back there.

00:37:25.867 --> 00:37:29.300
So again the question is, is
this a significant change?

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:32.867
If the channel with the fjord is
still choked with ice, does

00:37:32.867 --> 00:37:36.700
it make any difference whether
the calving is here or the

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.000
calving is I would think it
would make a difference.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.867
Because again, if you're calving
back here, that's

00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:46.333
going to allow a faster flow
down from the ice sheet.

00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:49.167
You're going to be moving more
ice from the Greenland Ice

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:52.433
Sheet if the calving is back
here than if it has to go all

00:37:52.433 --> 00:37:56.033
the way up here before
it can calve off.

00:37:56.033 --> 00:37:59.867
I was there last year and
took some pictures.

00:37:59.867 --> 00:38:02.600
There's nothing for scale here,
but that's about 40

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.800
meters high.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.067
And then when you think what
lies below that oh, and I'm

00:38:08.067 --> 00:38:09.500
looking across the channels.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:12.000
Through the little gap there
you can see the land on the

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.767
other side of that fjord.

00:38:15.767 --> 00:38:17.000
But those are pretty impressive

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.600
glaciers, just the part--

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.200
icebergs, just the part
that are above water.

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.300
Here's a small ship for scale.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.233
You can get some idea.

00:38:26.233 --> 00:38:28.867
Has anybody seen something like
this, traveled to high

00:38:28.867 --> 00:38:31.100
latitudes and seen something
like this?

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:31.833
Where were you?

00:38:31.833 --> 00:38:32.633
STUDENT: Antarctica.

00:38:32.633 --> 00:38:33.367
PROFESSOR: Antarctica.

00:38:33.367 --> 00:38:33.867
Nice.

00:38:33.867 --> 00:38:35.633
Yes.

00:38:35.633 --> 00:38:40.433
So they look a bit different in
Antarctica, but the physics

00:38:40.433 --> 00:38:41.400
is the same.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.300
It depends on the shape of the
ice, how much it's crumpled as

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.367
it comes down before
it breaks off.

00:38:46.367 --> 00:38:49.233
But basically, you've got the
same process happening in both

00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:50.467
hemispheres.

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:56.033
The other reason I wanted to
show you this particular

00:38:56.033 --> 00:39:02.833
location, Jacobshaven, is that
there's good reason to think

00:39:02.833 --> 00:39:08.967
that it was a Jacobshaven
iceberg that sunk the Titanic.

00:39:08.967 --> 00:39:12.767
And I want to show you
the geometry of that.

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:20.533
So here is Jacobshaven, on the
west coast of Greenland.

00:39:20.533 --> 00:39:25.067
And if an iceberg breaks off
there, it'll be carried first

00:39:25.067 --> 00:39:27.133
northward by the West
Greenland Current.

00:39:27.133 --> 00:39:29.467
Then at some point it'll get
drawn into the Labrador

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:32.667
current, come down past
if it's large enough.

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:34.533
It will be melting as it comes
down through here.

00:39:34.533 --> 00:39:37.933
But if it's large enough, it
will persist and possibly get

00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:44.333
down into this area south of 50
north, and maybe even south

00:39:44.333 --> 00:39:47.433
of 45 degrees north,
down in this area.

00:39:47.433 --> 00:39:51.233
And at that point now, it
becomes into the great circle

00:39:51.233 --> 00:39:57.600
route for ships between say
New York and England.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:04.967
And that's what the Titanic was
doing in April of 1912.

00:40:04.967 --> 00:40:07.467
It was making its way from
well, it started in

00:40:07.467 --> 00:40:12.233
Southampton, England, and was
making its way to New York.

00:40:12.233 --> 00:40:14.067
And that's where it hit
the iceberg and sunk.

00:40:14.067 --> 00:40:16.967
So almost certainly
it came from the

00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:18.100
west coast of Greenland.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:22.967
And because Jacobshaven is known
to be the most prolific

00:40:22.967 --> 00:40:27.933
generator of icebergs, I guess
it's a fair guess that it was

00:40:27.933 --> 00:40:31.933
one of those Jacobshaven
icebergs that was the one that

00:40:31.933 --> 00:40:36.500
did the deed for the Titanic.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.733
Any questions on that?

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.800
Now we'll turn to mountain
glaciers.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.700
And there again, a bit like the
ice sheets, you have an

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:53.700
accumulation zone and
an ablation zone.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:57.667
So every year, full 12 months
that goes by, you've added a

00:40:57.667 --> 00:41:00.233
bit of ice here.

00:41:00.233 --> 00:41:02.567
And that cannot continue.

00:41:02.567 --> 00:41:04.933
You've got to balance that
mass in some way.

00:41:04.933 --> 00:41:08.967
And that is eventually
balanced by a flow, a

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:12.967
liquid-like flow down
the mountain slope

00:41:12.967 --> 00:41:14.367
by the glacier itself.

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:19.333
Some of it is accomplished
by distorting the ice.

00:41:19.333 --> 00:41:22.267
And some of it is accomplished
by just sliding the ice along

00:41:22.267 --> 00:41:23.667
the bottom.

00:41:23.667 --> 00:41:26.467
But in any case, it is
moving under the

00:41:26.467 --> 00:41:29.167
influence of gravity.

00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:32.733
And then in some cases, it makes
it all the way down to

00:41:32.733 --> 00:41:34.167
the ocean surface.

00:41:34.167 --> 00:41:35.533
Question, yes?

00:41:35.533 --> 00:41:36.900
STUDENT: Can you explain
what you mean by

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.267
distorting the ice?

00:41:38.267 --> 00:41:39.567
PROFESSOR: So if you do a viscous

00:41:39.567 --> 00:41:41.033
experiment, if you--

00:41:41.033 --> 00:41:44.733
let me get the lights
on for a second.

00:41:44.733 --> 00:41:54.967
If you tilt your pancake and
pour that syrup on it, you'll

00:41:54.967 --> 00:42:00.400
find that the syrup is not
slipping along the bottom.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.100
It actually has a
shear within it.

00:42:07.633 --> 00:42:09.533
Icebergs do--I'm sorry, glaciers
do some of this, but

00:42:09.533 --> 00:42:12.433
they also slip a little
bit along the base.

00:42:12.433 --> 00:42:14.667
So it would be more accurate
to draw it like this.

00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:17.067
There's some internal
deformation, but there's also

00:42:17.067 --> 00:42:18.900
some slip right at the bottom.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:23.067
So it's a combination of the
two that allows it to slide

00:42:23.067 --> 00:42:26.200
down the slope like that.

00:42:28.833 --> 00:42:29.333
Thanks for that.

00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:37.733
So in this case, for these two
glaciers in Alaska, they've

00:42:37.733 --> 00:42:40.400
actually made it all the
way down to sea level.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.700
This one easily.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.867
This one just barely.

00:42:43.867 --> 00:42:47.767
But any glacier that makes it
down to sea level is called a

00:42:47.767 --> 00:42:49.567
tidewater glacier.

00:42:49.567 --> 00:42:55.033
It makes it down, and then
partly because of the tides

00:42:55.033 --> 00:42:57.667
but it would happen anyway
you'll get calving, and you

00:42:57.667 --> 00:42:58.733
produce icebergs.

00:42:58.733 --> 00:43:02.867
So a tidewater glacier will
produce icebergs that will

00:43:02.867 --> 00:43:06.267
then float out over the sea.

00:43:06.267 --> 00:43:08.533
You're likely to have these
in high latitudes.

00:43:08.533 --> 00:43:10.367
Remember, you can have mountain
glaciers in low

00:43:10.367 --> 00:43:11.600
latitudes too.

00:43:14.333 --> 00:43:19.600
Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa,
almost exactly on the equator,

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.567
has a glacier at the top.

00:43:21.567 --> 00:43:23.300
But it certainly doesn't
come down very far.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:25.867
And it certainly does not reach
any ocean where you

00:43:25.867 --> 00:43:28.533
would produce icebergs.

00:43:28.533 --> 00:43:33.567
But these tidewater glaciers
do produce icebergs.

00:43:33.567 --> 00:43:36.000
Here's an example in Alaska
of one that does

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.433
not, Stevens Glacier.

00:43:37.433 --> 00:43:42.267
So you can see glaciers from
various parts of the mountain

00:43:42.267 --> 00:43:44.700
chain combining and merging.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.800
Here is the last merger
right here.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:49.700
But then there's the terminus
of the glacier.

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.800
There is some melt water and
the river will carry that

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.033
water away to the sea.

00:43:54.033 --> 00:43:57.867
The water will get to the sea,
but not the ice itself.

00:43:57.867 --> 00:44:01.400
So this is happening
more and more.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.500
As glaciers--as the climate
warms and glaciers retreat,

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.400
their terminus moves
further up.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.300
But eventually that water,
of course, always

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.067
returns to the sea.

00:44:15.067 --> 00:44:16.767
Very often you can
see the seam.

00:44:16.767 --> 00:44:19.500
Where two glaciers come together
you have a little bit

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:21.633
of rock rubble.

00:44:21.633 --> 00:44:25.800
And in some glaciers you can
see way down at their snout

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:29.633
you can see five or six of
these little black lines.

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:33.033
And if you trace them back, each
one of them originates at

00:44:33.033 --> 00:44:33.967
a point like this.

00:44:33.967 --> 00:44:38.233
So you can actually keep track
of all the tributaries by the

00:44:38.233 --> 00:44:45.100
little line of rock rubble that
gets permanently put into

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:47.333
the glacier.

00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:48.500
Questions there?

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.633
So again, the speed of these
things are quite slow.

00:44:53.633 --> 00:44:59.067
They might be only a few
centimeters per day or a few

00:44:59.067 --> 00:45:01.467
centimeters per week,
in some cases.

00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:05.767
But what they can do is drive
a stake here, go up on the

00:45:05.767 --> 00:45:08.433
bedrock, triangulate,
get the location.

00:45:08.433 --> 00:45:11.400
And then come back a week or
two later and see how much

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.633
that stake has moved.

00:45:12.633 --> 00:45:15.467
And that will at least give you
the speed of the ice at

00:45:15.467 --> 00:45:16.933
the top of the glacier.

00:45:16.933 --> 00:45:19.500
It won't give you everything
you need to know about the

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:21.733
depth all the way through,
the speed

00:45:21.733 --> 00:45:26.233
down through the glacier.

00:45:26.233 --> 00:45:31.033
Here's a couple of glaciers
from Norway.

00:45:33.667 --> 00:45:41.133
The word, well, "breen" simply
means ice or glacier, and so

00:45:41.133 --> 00:45:46.100
all the glaciers in Norway end
with the suffix "-breen." But

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.800
there's the one in Briksdal,
and there's the one in Jenn

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.667
and of course, "dal" just means
"valley" in Norwegian,

00:45:51.667 --> 00:45:56.100
so Jennsdals glacier and
Briks valley glacier.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.067
They're all named like that.

00:45:57.067 --> 00:46:03.200
But these are not tidewater
glaciers.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.300
This is not the sea.

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:07.467
This is a little lake at the
bottom of the glacier, a

00:46:07.467 --> 00:46:08.733
freshwater lake.

00:46:08.733 --> 00:46:11.967
And it has that milky appearance
to it because

00:46:11.967 --> 00:46:15.500
underneath the glacier, where
there's a grinding process

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:20.267
going on, you're developing
a kind of powder from the

00:46:20.267 --> 00:46:21.367
grinding of rock.

00:46:21.367 --> 00:46:22.900
And that ends up in the water.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:26.100
And then if you see that river,
even miles away, it'll

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:30.200
have that characteristic
milky appearance.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:32.433
And you can say, that one
came from a glacier.

00:46:32.433 --> 00:46:36.533
That river water came from a
glacier, because it has that

00:46:36.533 --> 00:46:40.600
so-called glacial milk and it's
characteristic of water

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:43.733
that flows out from a mountain
glacier like that.

00:46:46.367 --> 00:46:49.600
Questions there?

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.233
Here's another one.

00:46:51.233 --> 00:46:54.500
You can see the terminus of that
and the water rushing out

00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:58.333
from underneath in
that stream.

00:47:03.167 --> 00:47:07.000
We are, let's see, yeah...
I guess we'll quit here

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.567
and just finish up.

00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:12.467
There's just a little bit left
on ice, but I want to do a

00:47:12.467 --> 00:47:13.133
good job on that.

00:47:13.133 --> 00:47:15.400
So we'll wait until Monday
and finish that up.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.123
Right.
 

00:00:02.123 --> 00:00:04.880
Well, the Glorious Revolution
of 1688,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.370
so-called, which I described
last time,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.770
began as a relatively bloodless
coup,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.926
but it did go on to usher in
some pretty massive changes in

00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:20.226
the structure of government and
also in Britain's standing in

00:00:20.226 --> 00:00:21.230
the world.
 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.847
In the twenty years after the
Revolution Britain began to

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:27.560
emerge as one of Europe's great
powers,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.662
and we'll look at that in the
final full lecture after the

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:33.380
break.
 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.177
But part of understanding that
change requires us to understand

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:45.069
how Britain was able to sustain
that kind of role after 1688 and

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:48.810
that brings us back to the
economy,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.598
especially in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth

00:00:52.598 --> 00:00:53.440
centuries.
 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.269
So you have your lovingly
handcrafted handout,

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.780
a sort of artisan handout,
and that contains the basic

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.099
facts and I'll take you through
it.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.084
I always notice whenever I
announce there's going to be a

00:01:08.084 --> 00:01:11.495
lecture in economic history that
it seems to have the same effect

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:14.000
as the great plague of 1666 on
our numbers;

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.730
but it matters.
 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.959
Okay.
 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:18.421
Right.
 

00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:22.816
Well, a few weeks ago I left
the narrative of economic and

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:27.518
social change at the point in
the mid-seventeenth century when

00:01:27.518 --> 00:01:32.144
population and prices began to
stabilize after over a century

00:01:32.144 --> 00:01:34.766
of growth but,
as I said then,

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:38.293
the dynamic of change that had
been unleashed in the later

00:01:38.293 --> 00:01:41.819
sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries didn't stop.

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:47.343
Rather it continued in a
changing and increasingly

00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:52.459
favorable climate,
and central to that new context

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:57.160
was the relative stability of
population and prices.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.650
In 1641, as you'll see on table
one of your handout,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.843
the population was just over
five million and it remained at

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:11.419
approximately that level for
many decades to come.

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.822
In fact, in some parts of the
late seventeenth century

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:18.544
population growth rates for
particular decades were in fact

00:02:18.544 --> 00:02:19.378
negative.
 

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:22.649
In 1701, the population was
still just over five million and

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.252
it was only about five and a
half million by the

00:02:25.252 --> 00:02:26.750
mid-eighteenth century.
 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.633
Renewed growth didn't start
until the late eighteenth

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:31.378
century.
 

00:02:31.378 --> 00:02:35.806
Well, the reasons for this
relative stability seem fairly

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:40.470
clear in the light of research
by demographic historians.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.753
As table two indicates,
fertility, as measured by the

00:02:46.753 --> 00:02:52.407
gross rate of reproduction,
reached its nadir in the third

00:02:52.407 --> 00:02:54.910
quarter of the seventeenth
century,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.306
and thereafter from about the
1670s it began to recover a

00:02:58.306 --> 00:03:03.223
little but very,
very slowly and it didn't reach

00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:09.658
its sixteenth-century levels
again until after 1760.

00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:14.182
Any potential that there might
have been for renewed growth was

00:03:14.182 --> 00:03:16.810
choked off by two further
factors.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.675
First of all,
the late seventeenth century

00:03:20.675 --> 00:03:24.919
saw a decline in life
expectation at birth.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:29.025
It was as low as thirty-three
on average by the end of the

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:30.610
seventeenth century.
 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.312
It's a paradox that mortality
was so bad in a period which

00:03:35.312 --> 00:03:39.438
actually saw the final
disappearance of plague from

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:40.430
Britain.
 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.575
The outbreak in London in 1665
to '6 was the last great

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:48.675
outbreak,
but the absence of that kind of

00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:52.460
crisis mortality didn't prevent
generally high levels of what

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.803
the demographers refer to as
background mortality from

00:03:55.803 --> 00:03:57.378
infectious diseases.
 

00:03:57.378 --> 00:03:59.438
One of them,
Mary Dobson,

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:04.246
has shown that high levels of
mortality were particularly

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:08.723
associated with urban centers,
with low-lying areas,

00:04:08.723 --> 00:04:12.211
with poor water supplies,
with the growing industrial

00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:15.989
areas of the kingdom,
and with the areas along

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.610
significant trade routes.
 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.209
And her suggestion is that
these facts are the outcome of,

00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:25.377
in the first place,
denser concentrations of

00:04:25.377 --> 00:04:29.577
population in the cities and
also those areas which shared

00:04:29.577 --> 00:04:33.630
that density in the countryside
and which were linked by

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.684
communications which made the
transmission of infectious

00:04:37.684 --> 00:04:40.190
diseases that much easier.
 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.559
A more closely interconnected
society was one in which disease

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.069
transmission could take place
more effectively.

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.629
So, mortality was pretty bad in
the late seventeenth century.

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:56.160
And secondly a further factor
was migration.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.410
That was partly overseas
migration.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.074
Between 1650 and 1699,
almost a quarter of a million

00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:08.649
migrants left England for
overseas destinations;

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:13.300
mostly to the Americas,
mostly going either to the West

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.122
Indies or to the southern
colonies of mainland America as

00:05:18.122 --> 00:05:20.189
indentured servants.
 

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:24.682
And a second part of the
migration factor was internal

00:05:24.682 --> 00:05:28.716
migration;
internal movement of people to

00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:34.649
the rather unhealthy urban
centers and industrial centers.

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:39.029
The high death rates in those
places did much to wipe out the

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:41.730
surplus births of healthier
areas,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.709
as people moved into less
healthy urban or industrial

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:48.860
centers.
 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.980
So, population stability for
almost a century.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:58.627
The century after 1650 also saw
a new era in price trends and

00:05:58.627 --> 00:06:02.889
they're represented on section
three of your handout.

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.923
As you'll see from that,
the index shows that the prices

00:06:06.923 --> 00:06:10.415
of wheat and barley,
the principal bread corns,

00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:14.718
were actually falling from the
1650s through to about the 1680s

00:06:14.718 --> 00:06:18.259
and then after a few bad
harvests in the 1690s,

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:24.233
they fluctuated at about 20%
below the level they had been in

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:27.220
the mid-seventeenth century.
 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.432
In contrast,
the prices of meat remained

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:33.399
fairly stable,
even rose modestly.

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:36.596
The impact of this,
falling prices for bread corns,

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:39.985
stable prices for meat,
on the standards of the common

00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:42.160
people was quite considerable.
 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.665
The actual wage rates that
people were being paid didn't

00:06:45.665 --> 00:06:49.680
change a great deal in the late
seventeenth century but people's

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.706
real wages,
the purchasing power of their

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:56.190
wages,
increased quite substantially

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.028
for the first time in over a
century.

00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:04.449
So the evidence suggests that
by the 1680s real wages,

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:09.367
the purchasing power of wages,
were up by about 50% over the

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:11.370
levels of the 1630s.
 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.579
For people who could find
regular work,

00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:17.199
the costs of feeding their
families were falling,

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:21.531
and that released some
purchasing power for goods over

00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:26.189
and above those that they needed
for basic subsistence.

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:29.262
So then, population
stabilization,

00:07:29.262 --> 00:07:33.637
declining prices of basic
agricultural products,

00:07:33.637 --> 00:07:38.759
growing real wages for
craftsmen and wage laborers.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.682
And to understand the outcome
of these trends we have to

00:07:41.682 --> 00:07:44.815
remember that all of this is
happening in what was already a

00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:48.877
more commercialized economy,
in which the livelihoods of

00:07:48.877 --> 00:07:53.752
most people were increasingly
dependent on the markets for

00:07:53.752 --> 00:07:59.139
their products and their labor
in a more integrated economy.

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:03.093
And the outcome of all of this
was a further development in the

00:08:03.093 --> 00:08:06.663
processes of economic growth
which had been set in motion

00:08:06.663 --> 00:08:07.430
earlier.
 

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.261
One can sum it all up as being
a process of increased regional

00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:17.730
economic specialization,
intensified national economic

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.785
integration,
and also increasing

00:08:21.785 --> 00:08:27.189
participation in a nascent world
economy.

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:31.718
That sounds very grand,
but we can follow through with

00:08:31.718 --> 00:08:37.190
the processes step by step as to
how all of this fit together.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.486
In agriculture the key to
change was basically the fact

00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:43.356
that although markets for
different products had

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.799
stabilized somewhat and
reoriented,

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:48.788
they didn't actually decline.
 

00:08:48.788 --> 00:08:51.019
The population stabilized,
but it didn't decline.

00:08:51.019 --> 00:08:55.687
There was still a large market
for agricultural produce and

00:08:55.687 --> 00:09:00.436
that placed general pressure on
commercial farmers to try to

00:09:00.436 --> 00:09:05.104
keep up their market share by
reducing their unit costs and

00:09:05.104 --> 00:09:09.288
competing with other farmers to
produce more,

00:09:09.288 --> 00:09:12.556
more effectively,
at prices which would enable

00:09:12.556 --> 00:09:15.750
their profit margins to remain
reasonable.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.519
And that meant a renewed
emphasis on agricultural

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.620
improvement.
 

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.922
Basically one can say that the
late seventeenth century saw a

00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:27.279
more general spread of many of
the innovations in agricultural

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:30.528
techniques which I described
coming in in the late sixteenth

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:32.620
and early seventeenth centuries.
 

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.643
It's been said by one
agricultural historian that many

00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:38.724
of the novel techniques of a
century earlier had become

00:09:38.724 --> 00:09:42.230
general practice,
general best practice,

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.610
by the early eighteenth
century.

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.332
All of that involved,
and was part and parcel of,

00:09:49.332 --> 00:09:52.980
a general regional
reorientation in land use.

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.318
Increasingly,
the east and the southeast of

00:09:56.318 --> 00:09:59.500
the country were predominantly
arable.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.009
That was the best price area
for cereals.

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:07.087
It had major markets in London
and the towns of the southeast

00:10:07.087 --> 00:10:10.418
and also markets in nearby
continental Europe,

00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:14.125
but elsewhere in the kingdom
livestock husbandry became more

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:16.700
prevalent in the north and in
the west.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:18.889
They'd always had a bias
towards livestock.

00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:21.480
It became more marked.
 

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.940
One mustn't exaggerate all this
into complete regional

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:28.115
homogeneity,
but there was a definite trend

00:10:28.115 --> 00:10:31.846
toward specialization of that
kind within particular

00:10:31.846 --> 00:10:33.750
agricultural countries.
 

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.729
And that made easier the
diffusion and adoption of

00:10:37.729 --> 00:10:39.759
innovations by example.
 

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:41.899
People saw what their neighbors
were doing.

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:44.311
There is an excellent account
of all of this by one of the

00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.129
writers of the late seventeenth
century,

00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:48.226
John Aubrey,
who describes what was

00:10:48.226 --> 00:10:52.360
happening in his home county of
Wiltshire down in the southwest,

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.216
to the southwest of Oxford,
and in Wiltshire Aubrey

00:10:55.216 --> 00:10:58.190
describes how various
innovations were brought in.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.041
He names names;
who was the first to do this or

00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:03.318
to do that,
and he describes how their

00:11:03.318 --> 00:11:07.110
neighbors copied them when they
saw that particular innovations

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.190
were successful and profitable.
 

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.485
Overall the whole process
greatly raised agricultural

00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:14.230
output.
 

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.163
It's been estimated that the
cereals yield in eastern and

00:11:19.163 --> 00:11:24.889
southeastern England was up by
about 40% between 1650 and 1750;

00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:30.855
an environment then of rising
agricultural productivity,

00:11:30.855 --> 00:11:36.389
induced by a more competitive
commercial climate.

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:41.450
Well, that agricultural
specialization facilitated,

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.793
and was in turn encouraged by,
the continued growth of the

00:11:45.793 --> 00:11:49.374
urban population and the
continued growth of the

00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:53.259
population in the
nonagricultural rural areas,

00:11:53.259 --> 00:11:57.553
the rural areas where many
people were employed in various

00:11:57.553 --> 00:11:59.058
kinds of industry.
 

00:11:59.058 --> 00:12:01.793
And in turn,
growing agricultural

00:12:01.793 --> 00:12:07.091
productivity released labor for
nonagricultural occupations and

00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:12.561
enhanced the purchasing power of
those who lived by wages in such

00:12:12.561 --> 00:12:14.100
occupations.
 

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:18.326
One of the most striking
features of the late seventeenth

00:12:18.326 --> 00:12:23.004
and early eighteenth centuries
is that although population as a

00:12:23.004 --> 00:12:27.683
whole stabilized the population
of the towns and the population

00:12:27.683 --> 00:12:31.533
of the rural industrial areas
continued to grow both

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:34.100
absolutely and relatively.
 

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.110
There was a regional
redistribution of population.

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:42.403
Table 4A shows the figures
which have been calculated for

00:12:42.403 --> 00:12:44.320
this by E.A. Wrigley.
 

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.607
As you'll see if you look at
4A, rural agricultural

00:12:49.607 --> 00:12:55.847
population declined from just
over 60% in the 1670s to about

00:12:55.847 --> 00:12:58.070
46% by the 1750s.
 

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:03.573
Those living in towns of more
than 5,000 rose from just over

00:13:03.573 --> 00:13:09.359
13% to about 21% of the national
population and those living in

00:13:09.359 --> 00:13:15.236
rural nonagricultural areas rose
from about 26 to about 33% over

00:13:15.236 --> 00:13:17.288
the same period.
 

00:13:17.288 --> 00:13:21.894
Now a good deal of that urban
growth was of course,

00:13:21.894 --> 00:13:25.672
as you would expect,
occasioned by London,

00:13:25.672 --> 00:13:26.870
as usual.
 

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:32.774
By 1700, London had a
population of 575,000 and was

00:13:32.774 --> 00:13:36.200
the biggest city in Europe.
 

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.779
By 1750, its population had
reached 675,000.

00:13:41.779 --> 00:13:45.524
So London continued to grow in
absolute terms,

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:50.519
but in fact its share of the
national population had somewhat

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:52.850
stabilized at about 11%.
 

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:56.974
What seems to have been
happening was that a great deal

00:13:56.974 --> 00:14:01.174
of the urban growth of this
period was going on in other

00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.548
towns as well.
 

00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:06.447
So, for example,
in 1600 England had had twenty

00:14:06.447 --> 00:14:10.259
towns with a population of more
than 5,000;

00:14:10.259 --> 00:14:19.178
by 1670 it had twenty-six;
by 1700 it had thirty-two.

00:14:19.178 --> 00:14:23.370
Provincial cities of more than
5,000 inhabitants were making up

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.090
an increasing proportion of the
national population,

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:32.409
by 1700 probably something like
5.5%.

00:14:32.409 --> 00:14:37.720
By 1750, it was closer to 10%.
 

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:41.857
All of this amounted to a kind
of re-articulation going on

00:14:41.857 --> 00:14:44.980
within the hierarchy of towns
and cities.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:49.283
Obviously, London remained at
the top, un-challengeably,

00:14:49.283 --> 00:14:53.429
but some historic regional
centers were stabilizing or

00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:55.700
growing only very slowly.
 

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.820
The old city of York,
for example,

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.802
remained stable at about 12,000
population through most of this

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:02.509
period.
 

00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:06.860
The real growth was going on in
different kinds of towns.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:12.248
It was going on above all in
ports, especially the ports of

00:15:12.248 --> 00:15:13.269
the west.
 

00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:17.808
If you look at table 4B,
Bristol, the principal port of

00:15:17.808 --> 00:15:21.423
the west of England,
grows from about 20,000

00:15:21.423 --> 00:15:24.870
population in 1670 to 50,000 by
1750.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.244
Liverpool, which was emerging
from having been a small market

00:15:28.244 --> 00:15:30.548
town in the early seventeenth
century,

00:15:30.548 --> 00:15:38.379
grew from about 5,000 people in
1670 to about 22,000 in 1750.

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:41.636
The other kinds of towns which
were growing disproportionately

00:15:41.636 --> 00:15:43.720
seem to have been industrial
centers.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.440
Newcastle in the northeast,
based on the coal trade,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.110
grew from 12,000 to 29,000 in
the period covered by our table;

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.989
Leeds, center of the worsted
manufacturers in the cloth

00:15:55.989 --> 00:16:02.894
industry, from 6,000 to 16,000;
Birmingham, center of

00:16:02.894 --> 00:16:10.668
metalworking,
from 6,000 to 24,000.

00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:14.535
This shift was especially
pronounced at the turn of the

00:16:14.535 --> 00:16:16.038
eighteenth century.
 

00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:20.692
It's been shown that in the
early decades of the eighteenth

00:16:20.692 --> 00:16:25.105
century whereas what have been
described as ten historic

00:16:25.105 --> 00:16:28.128
centers,
old cathedral cities and so

00:16:28.128 --> 00:16:31.058
forth, grew in population by
only 18%,

00:16:31.058 --> 00:16:37.510
a sample of eight ports shows
58% growth and a sample of new

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:41.230
manufacturing towns 159% growth.
 

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:45.308
So the urban system was
becoming more polycentric.

00:16:45.308 --> 00:16:49.470
It had more major centers than
it had done and,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.038
as will be apparent from what
I've already said,

00:16:52.038 --> 00:16:55.629
the dynamic of growth was in
commerce,

00:16:55.629 --> 00:17:00.352
in trade, and in industry,
taking off in the late

00:17:00.352 --> 00:17:05.076
seventeenth century and
accelerating in the early

00:17:05.076 --> 00:17:07.338
eighteenth century.
 

00:17:07.338 --> 00:17:10.847
So, let's turn to what was
going on there,

00:17:10.847 --> 00:17:14.527
to commerce,
about which you've already read

00:17:14.527 --> 00:17:15.640
a little.
 

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.066
In the 1960s,
as a result of the work of

00:17:18.066 --> 00:17:20.711
Ralph Davis,
who was the first economic

00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:24.730
historian to really map the
trends in trade in this period,

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.336
people began to talk of the
late seventeenth century as a

00:17:27.336 --> 00:17:29.058
period of 'commercial
revolution',

00:17:29.058 --> 00:17:35.068
which is a description which
has some justice to it.

00:17:35.068 --> 00:17:39.788
The focus in Davis' work was on
the major growth of

00:17:39.788 --> 00:17:44.413
extra-European trade,
especially with the Americas

00:17:44.413 --> 00:17:46.490
and with the East.
 

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:50.332
Now in considering this it's
important always to remember

00:17:50.332 --> 00:17:54.105
that the well-established trades
with European countries

00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:57.400
continued and indeed in many
ways they grew;

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:02.201
but the overall pattern of
overseas trade was undoubtedly

00:18:02.201 --> 00:18:05.150
shifting,
as initiatives which had been

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:09.388
pioneered by enterprising people
in the early seventeenth century

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:13.915
began to pay off,
became consolidated and

00:18:13.915 --> 00:18:15.278
extended.
 

00:18:15.278 --> 00:18:19.556
And there are four major
aspects of this change which are

00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:24.366
illustrated in different ways on
the second side of your handout

00:18:24.366 --> 00:18:28.108
in these figures dealing with
overseas trade.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:34.347
The first can be illustrated if
we look at London's domestic

00:18:34.347 --> 00:18:38.259
exports in section A of that
table.

00:18:38.259 --> 00:18:41.516
As it shows,
in 1640 in the eve of the Civil

00:18:41.516 --> 00:18:46.058
War London's exports were still
dominated by woolen cloth.

00:18:46.058 --> 00:18:50.700
Some 92% of exports were woolen
cloth.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:55.323
By the later 1660s,
though, that was down to 74%

00:18:55.323 --> 00:18:58.568
and by 1700 it was down to 72%.
 

00:18:58.568 --> 00:19:03.737
Now that change took place not
because woolen exports were

00:19:03.737 --> 00:19:07.816
actually declining,
but because of the rise of

00:19:07.816 --> 00:19:12.797
other kinds of domestic exports;
greater exports of foodstuffs

00:19:12.797 --> 00:19:16.624
and of raw materials,
agricultural products,

00:19:16.624 --> 00:19:21.289
fish, lead, tin,
coal, animal hides that had

00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:23.903
together--
all of that together had--made

00:19:23.903 --> 00:19:26.460
up only five percent of London's
exports in 1640;

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.278
it was over 12% by 1700.
 

00:19:30.278 --> 00:19:35.450
And then the export from London
of other domestic manufactures;

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:42.170
2.6 percent of London's exports
in 1640, just over 15% by 1700.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:47.564
So there was a reorientation in
the export trade in domestic

00:19:47.564 --> 00:19:48.568
products.
 

00:19:48.568 --> 00:19:51.838
Secondly, if we look at
London's imports,

00:19:51.838 --> 00:19:57.501
which is section B of the
table, that brings out the

00:19:57.501 --> 00:20:03.719
continued growth in the value of
imports from established

00:20:03.719 --> 00:20:09.496
European trading partners;
wines from southern Europe as

00:20:09.496 --> 00:20:14.557
you'll see growing dramatically
in the value of these imports

00:20:14.557 --> 00:20:18.380
between the 1630s and the 1690s;
silks again,

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.935
often from France or southern
Europe, rising quite

00:20:21.935 --> 00:20:25.710
significantly;
iron and steel imports mostly

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:29.478
from Scandinavia,
from Sweden in particular,

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:34.910
rising dramatically from 16,000
to 118,000 pounds in value.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:39.573
So, considerable growth in the
imports from these European

00:20:39.573 --> 00:20:43.599
trading partners,
but that was dwarfed by the

00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:49.000
imports which were coming in
from the East and the Americas.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:55.067
Those imports were increasingly
becoming predominant in London's

00:20:55.067 --> 00:20:59.593
import trade so we have
continued growth in such

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:03.348
commodities as pepper and
tobacco,

00:21:03.348 --> 00:21:06.288
but massive growth in the
import of calicos--

00:21:06.288 --> 00:21:09.230
that's cheap cotton cloth from
India--

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.509
and sugar from the West
Indies--almost,

00:21:12.509 --> 00:21:17.049
well, a fivefold increase in
the value of the sugar imported

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:21.358
from the West Indies in the
later seventeenth century.

00:21:21.358 --> 00:21:28.036
Thirdly, a great deal of these
new imported goods were not

00:21:28.036 --> 00:21:35.650
consumed domestically but were
re-exported to European markets.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.785
So for example two thirds of
the tobacco that was landed in

00:21:39.785 --> 00:21:43.492
England was re-exported to
European markets mostly in

00:21:43.492 --> 00:21:44.920
northern Europe.
 

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.451
A third of the sugar that was
landed was re-exported to

00:21:48.451 --> 00:21:49.038
Europe.
 

00:21:49.038 --> 00:21:53.440
Nine tenths of the pepper that
came in from the East was

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.558
re-exported.
 

00:21:54.558 --> 00:22:00.557
You can look at the rising
value of those re-exports in

00:22:00.557 --> 00:22:01.778
table 5C.
 

00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:03.828
We have the value of domestic
exports,

00:22:03.828 --> 00:22:06.848
the value of imports and the
value of re-exports,

00:22:06.848 --> 00:22:12.164
and look how it grows in the
course of the late seventeenth

00:22:12.164 --> 00:22:15.190
and early eighteenth centuries.
 

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.400
What was happening then was a
flood of tobacco,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.260
sugar, calico,
other products coming in from

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.200
distant overseas origins which
was then re-exported,

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.155
bringing income to the English
merchants who re-exported it to

00:22:32.155 --> 00:22:32.740
Europe.
 

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.991
One of the interesting things
about all of these products is

00:22:35.991 --> 00:22:37.259
that they were cheap.
 

00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:39.769
A hogshead of tobacco might be
expensive in itself,

00:22:39.769 --> 00:22:43.160
but by the time it was broken
down in to small parcels,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.430
was sold by the pipe,
it had a mass market--

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:47.470
it was cheap.
 

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:48.779
Similarly sugar.
 

00:22:48.779 --> 00:22:50.970
Sugar might be in the form of a
great sugarloaf,

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.529
but by the time something had
been chipped off it,

00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:57.650
wrapped up and sold in small
quantities it had a mass market.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.575
Calico cloth was very cheap,
the kind of cheap and colorful

00:23:01.575 --> 00:23:05.027
Indian cotton cloth which we're
still familiar with,

00:23:05.027 --> 00:23:07.598
which could be bought by
servants.

00:23:07.598 --> 00:23:11.365
A mass market for these goods,
and in fact the figures that we

00:23:11.365 --> 00:23:13.960
have here don't tell us the
whole story.

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.734
It's well known that there was
a great deal of smuggling and

00:23:16.734 --> 00:23:17.769
evading the customs.
 

00:23:17.769 --> 00:23:19.769
The figures are based on the
customs records.

00:23:19.769 --> 00:23:24.790
The reality may have been even
greater change than the figures

00:23:24.790 --> 00:23:26.519
actually represent.
 

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:27.113
Right.
 

00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:32.057
Well, these new trades were
based upon and involved

00:23:32.057 --> 00:23:38.288
elaborating more complex and
multilateral trading patterns,

00:23:38.288 --> 00:23:40.950
the fourth feature of the
changing trade.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:44.068
These are often described as
the triangular trades.

00:23:44.068 --> 00:23:47.474
So for example you would get
vessels leaving the western

00:23:47.474 --> 00:23:50.880
ports of Britain for the
fisheries in the north Atlantic

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.594
around Newfoundland from which
they would bring the dried cod

00:23:54.594 --> 00:23:58.308
to southern Europe where it was
in great demand and then they

00:23:58.308 --> 00:24:02.210
would bring southern European
products back to Britain;

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.950
a triangle.
 

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:08.022
Or ships would leave London
usually heading for the East

00:24:08.022 --> 00:24:08.690
Indies.
 

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:12.936
They would trade around the
East Indies between the Indian

00:24:12.936 --> 00:24:16.439
mainland and what's now
Indonesia and then bring

00:24:16.439 --> 00:24:18.598
products back to Britain.
 

00:24:18.598 --> 00:24:21.131
The most famous of these
triangles of course is the

00:24:21.131 --> 00:24:24.244
so-called Atlantic Triangle;
the export of manufactured

00:24:24.244 --> 00:24:27.538
products,
weaponry, and liquor to West

00:24:27.538 --> 00:24:30.329
Africa,
the buying there of slaves to

00:24:30.329 --> 00:24:34.164
be taken across to the Caribbean
and the southern mainland

00:24:34.164 --> 00:24:38.808
colonies,
the notorious Atlantic Triangle.

00:24:38.808 --> 00:24:43.481
That was of course a ghastly
trade with terrible mortality of

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:47.999
both the slaves and indeed the
English crews on the 'middle

00:24:47.999 --> 00:24:50.553
passage',
but it was vital to the

00:24:50.553 --> 00:24:53.923
development of the Atlantic
economy and contemporaries

00:24:53.923 --> 00:24:56.660
simply seem to have accepted it
as such;

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:00.859
little comment initially on
what it involved,

00:25:00.859 --> 00:25:03.818
few voices raised in protest.
 

00:25:03.818 --> 00:25:07.088
Slavery in itself of course was
nothing new.

00:25:07.088 --> 00:25:11.116
What was new was the scale and
systematization of the trade as

00:25:11.116 --> 00:25:14.815
it developed in the late
seventeenth and early eighteenth

00:25:14.815 --> 00:25:15.740
centuries.
 

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.397
And if it offered any ray of
hope in all of this it was

00:25:19.397 --> 00:25:23.461
simply that as people became
more familiar with its realities

00:25:23.461 --> 00:25:26.240
voices began to be raised
against it;

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:29.920
but not yet.
 

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:34.465
This transformation of trade
was well established by the

00:25:34.465 --> 00:25:39.757
1680s and then it stabilized and
continued to grow steadily right

00:25:39.757 --> 00:25:44.798
through to the mid-eighteenth
century and indeed beyond,

00:25:44.798 --> 00:25:48.538
and all of it was vigorously
defended by legislation,

00:25:48.538 --> 00:25:53.367
the Navigation Acts which made
every effort to keep these

00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:55.608
trades in English hands.
 

00:25:55.608 --> 00:25:59.073
Certain goods could only be
exported to the colonies in

00:25:59.073 --> 00:26:00.098
English ships.
 

00:26:00.098 --> 00:26:04.462
Certain goods could only be
landed in England before being

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:07.220
re-exported to other
destinations;

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:12.634
an effort to keep this new
burgeoning trade in the hands of

00:26:12.634 --> 00:26:17.769
English merchants and in
particular to squeeze out their

00:26:17.769 --> 00:26:21.130
greatest competitors,
the Dutch.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:21.566
Okay.
 

00:26:21.566 --> 00:26:26.105
Well, this expansion of
overseas trade created income

00:26:26.105 --> 00:26:29.034
obviously;
it created employment in

00:26:29.034 --> 00:26:33.147
shipping in the commercial
infrastructure of the growing

00:26:33.147 --> 00:26:37.046
port cities;
it was directly linked in that

00:26:37.046 --> 00:26:38.990
way to urban growth.
 

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.730
And above all London of course.
 

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.968
Three quarters of English
overseas trade still went

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:43.730
through London.
 

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.519
Half the merchant fleet was
based in London.

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:49.914
London was the dominant center
for shipbuilding and repairing,

00:26:49.914 --> 00:26:52.808
all the ancillary crafts of the
shipping industry.

00:26:52.808 --> 00:26:56.945
It was the center for sugar
refining and tobacco processing

00:26:56.945 --> 00:27:00.011
and many other manufactures
linked to trade,

00:27:00.011 --> 00:27:01.509
silk for example.
 

00:27:01.509 --> 00:27:04.828
But increasingly the so-called
"out ports,"

00:27:04.828 --> 00:27:07.828
the other ports,
were getting a bigger share.

00:27:07.828 --> 00:27:12.067
London's relative dominance,
especially in the Atlantic and

00:27:12.067 --> 00:27:14.990
re-export trades,
was being whittled down

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.940
somewhat.
 

00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:20.133
By 1700, about a third of
tobacco imports by value and

00:27:20.133 --> 00:27:24.721
about a fifth of sugar imports
by value came in not through

00:27:24.721 --> 00:27:29.470
London but through out ports
like Bristol and Liverpool.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:33.388
And after the union between
England and Scotland the city of

00:27:33.388 --> 00:27:36.876
Glasgow,
which became the major British

00:27:36.876 --> 00:27:42.759
center of the tobacco trade as
the eighteenth century advanced.

00:27:42.759 --> 00:27:48.027
The health of trade was also of
immense significance to the

00:27:48.027 --> 00:27:53.838
development of other industries,
both directly and indirectly.

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:56.500
Of course, the trade in woolen
textiles,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.751
which remained so important,
had always been heavily

00:27:59.751 --> 00:28:03.769
influenced by overseas markets
for high-quality woolen cloth.

00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:09.083
That continued to be the case,
but the new trades also

00:28:09.083 --> 00:28:15.200
established new markets for both
traditional and new goods.

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.960
Prominent amongst these markets
were of course the Americas and

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.720
the growing colonies there.
 

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:26.130
In 1686, a survey of London's
exports that year shows that

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:32.015
London was already exporting 598
different commodities to North

00:28:32.015 --> 00:28:36.349
America,
in 329 ships if you want to

00:28:36.349 --> 00:28:37.038
know.
 

00:28:37.038 --> 00:28:40.996
They were going to Barbados,
to Jamaica, to the Chesapeake

00:28:40.996 --> 00:28:42.868
colonies, to New England.
 

00:28:42.868 --> 00:28:47.132
The total value was prodigious
and it involved trade in

00:28:47.132 --> 00:28:48.796
textiles,
in clothing,

00:28:48.796 --> 00:28:51.423
in metal wares,
in miscellaneous manufactures

00:28:51.423 --> 00:28:54.650
which were not produced in the
colonies themselves.

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:58.454
For example,
in 1686 they exported to the

00:28:58.454 --> 00:29:05.720
colonies 3,000 wine glasses;
they exported 6,000 saddles.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:10.269
These new markets encouraged
bulk manufacture.

00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:14.653
They encouraged the production
of standardized goods which

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:19.038
could be ordered and could be
produced by workers who were

00:29:19.038 --> 00:29:23.345
required to produce a certain
standardized article in the

00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:25.730
'putting out' industries.
 

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:30.111
So bulk manufacture of
standardized goods was steadily

00:29:30.111 --> 00:29:34.078
growing, another feature of
industrial change.

00:29:34.078 --> 00:29:38.900
So developing markets for
English products were of

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.459
powerful significance,
but much of the output of

00:29:43.459 --> 00:29:47.910
manufacturing industries was
still consumed at home.

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:52.134
As I've already indicated,
cheaper food raised real

00:29:52.134 --> 00:29:57.034
incomes for ordinary people,
gave them a margin above their

00:29:57.034 --> 00:29:59.400
basic subsistence needs.
 

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.172
At least at some point in their
life cycle they had more

00:30:03.172 --> 00:30:07.220
spending power and that money
was often spent on simple,

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.150
cheap manufactured goods:
calico cloth,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:15.019
linen, domestic utensils and so
forth.

00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:18.481
Moreover, a lot of the
additional income which was

00:30:18.481 --> 00:30:22.440
being generated in trade and
manufactures themselves,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.387
income which went to the
mercantile and commercial

00:30:25.387 --> 00:30:27.430
classes,
the "middle sort of

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.902
people,"
enabled those people to afford

00:30:29.902 --> 00:30:33.237
a greater variety of goods which
are often described as the

00:30:33.237 --> 00:30:36.463
"decencies of life";
not luxuries,

00:30:36.463 --> 00:30:40.388
not necessities,
but the decencies of life,

00:30:40.388 --> 00:30:44.406
often domestic goods of one
kind or another,

00:30:44.406 --> 00:30:46.650
or better clothing.
 

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.305
Taken together,
the new overseas markets and

00:30:50.305 --> 00:30:55.318
the growing domestic markets
encouraged the development of a

00:30:55.318 --> 00:31:00.232
larger,
a stronger and a more flexible

00:31:00.232 --> 00:31:02.440
industrial base.
 

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.680
Take textiles for example.
 

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.500
Woolen cloth manufacture
continued as a major industry.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:13.131
There was a continued
diversification of its products,

00:31:13.131 --> 00:31:15.940
partly for particular overseas
markets.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.212
The cloth-weaving villages of
the West Country for example

00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:24.336
produced most of the trade
blankets which went to supply

00:31:24.336 --> 00:31:27.108
the fur traders in North
America;

00:31:27.108 --> 00:31:31.095
the wonderful Hudson Bay
blankets which you can still buy

00:31:31.095 --> 00:31:31.950
in Canada.
 

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:34.038
They're still made in the west
of England.

00:31:34.038 --> 00:31:37.412
These colorful trade blankets
which you see in portraits of

00:31:37.412 --> 00:31:40.842
native Americans in the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth

00:31:40.842 --> 00:31:44.213
centuries were already being
produced specifically for that

00:31:44.213 --> 00:31:44.970
market.
 

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:48.901
In west Yorkshire in the area
around Leeds and Bradford there

00:31:48.901 --> 00:31:52.702
was a great growth in another
dimension of the woolen cloth

00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:56.650
industry,
the production of worsted cloth.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.471
It was aimed at the cheaper end
of the market,

00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:00.598
mostly domestic.
 

00:32:00.598 --> 00:32:02.848
In Lancashire,
around Manchester,

00:32:02.848 --> 00:32:06.153
there were further significant
new developments,

00:32:06.153 --> 00:32:09.740
Manchester lying just to the
east of Liverpool.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.500
In that area the linen
manufacturing industry became

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.098
concentrated in the late
seventeenth century,

00:32:15.098 --> 00:32:19.724
producing not only linen for
domestic needs but also

00:32:19.724 --> 00:32:24.531
producing sailcloth for the
growing merchant fleet and

00:32:24.531 --> 00:32:25.528
canvas.
 

00:32:25.528 --> 00:32:30.115
The Manchester area gradually
shifted over from linen to the

00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:33.068
development of cotton
manufacturing.

00:32:33.068 --> 00:32:36.932
They were imitating the
imported cotton cloth from

00:32:36.932 --> 00:32:39.930
India, trying to produce it at
home.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:44.438
By 1700, a million pounds a
year's worth of raw cotton was

00:32:44.438 --> 00:32:47.602
being imported,
much of it via Liverpool,

00:32:47.602 --> 00:32:50.450
to supply that growing
industry.

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.438
The cotton at this stage tended
to come from the Mediterranean

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:54.808
rather than North America.
 

00:32:54.808 --> 00:32:59.644
By the 1740s two million pounds
a year worth of raw cotton for

00:32:59.644 --> 00:33:01.308
Manchester's looms.
 

00:33:01.308 --> 00:33:05.515
The finished cotton cloth had a
big market at home and it was

00:33:05.515 --> 00:33:09.088
also exported to West Africa and
to the Americas.

00:33:09.088 --> 00:33:15.117
So by 1750 the Manchester area,
when a survey was done,

00:33:15.117 --> 00:33:20.700
had almost 5,000 looms working
producing cotton.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.751
That was an important precursor
of things that were to come in

00:33:24.751 --> 00:33:27.210
the cotton industry of
Lancashire,

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.395
but as yet many of the really
significant developments were

00:33:30.395 --> 00:33:31.440
outside textiles.
 

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.034
The pottery industry was taking
off in the west Midlands in

00:33:35.034 --> 00:33:37.700
Staffordshire to the north of
Birmingham.

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.384
First of all,
it concentrated on the

00:33:40.384 --> 00:33:45.368
production of coarse earthenware
and on so-called 'Delftware',

00:33:45.368 --> 00:33:49.268
which was in imitation of the
Delft pottery produced in the

00:33:49.268 --> 00:33:50.210
Netherlands.
 

00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:53.240
Production of that kind of
pottery doubled in the late

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.500
seventeenth century.
 

00:33:54.500 --> 00:34:00.105
Then they moved on to stoneware
particularly after the 1680s,

00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:05.337
and as the potteries expanded
employment in this industry

00:34:05.337 --> 00:34:06.460
trebled.
 

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.235
This was the age which saw the
foundation just a decade or two

00:34:10.235 --> 00:34:13.827
later of such firms that are
still familiar as Wedgwood and

00:34:13.827 --> 00:34:16.800
Royal Doulton in that area of
the potteries;

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.579
the west Midlands.
 

00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:21.250
Metal wares were also taking
off.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:25.440
The city of Sheffield in south
Yorkshire had long been involved

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:29.630
in the production of edge tools
but they began to diversify.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.998
They began to produce scissors
and files and metal buttons and

00:34:33.998 --> 00:34:35.360
razors and forks.
 

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.518
Forks were a novelty.
 

00:34:37.518 --> 00:34:40.481
Prior to this period people ate
their meat by stabbing it with a

00:34:40.481 --> 00:34:42.690
pointed knife and putting it in
their mouths.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.000
Forks were coming in,
Sheffield was manufacturing

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.300
them for this new market.
 

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:49.679
They were amongst the
'decencies' of life.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:53.483
In the west Midlands there was
comparable growth around

00:34:53.483 --> 00:34:56.230
Birmingham especially from the
1690s.

00:34:56.230 --> 00:35:00.869
Birmingham had long made nails
and tools and weaponry and

00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:04.489
saddlers' ironmongery,
but they began to make fancy

00:35:04.489 --> 00:35:07.922
buckles and buttons and pots and
pans and kettles and what they

00:35:07.922 --> 00:35:09.750
described as "toys."
 

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:14.579
Toys were steel jewelry often
made with wire twisted in

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:16.099
elaborate ways.
 

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:21.411
They began specializing also in
the production of boxes which

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:25.728
imitated Japanese imports;
it was known as 'Japanning',

00:35:25.728 --> 00:35:29.275
the production of lacquered
boxes in imitation of these

00:35:29.275 --> 00:35:33.413
popular products which had been
introduced by the trade with the

00:35:33.413 --> 00:35:34.070
East.
 

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.693
In this version they were
affordable by people of the

00:35:37.693 --> 00:35:40.550
middling sort,
not simply by the elite.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.369
They also had big markets in
guns,

00:35:43.369 --> 00:35:46.880
many of which were exported to
North America and to Africa,

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:50.824
and they supplied the planters
of the American colonies with

00:35:50.824 --> 00:35:53.911
cast nails,
with holes, with sugar cane

00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:57.389
knives,
with chains for their oxen to

00:35:57.389 --> 00:36:00.530
pull heavy weights and so forth.
 

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:05.653
And so one could go on for
other less dramatic developments

00:36:05.653 --> 00:36:10.159
in regional industrial
specialization and growth.

00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:13.931
And finally,
all of this required of course

00:36:13.931 --> 00:36:15.369
raw materials.
 

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:18.615
Some of those raw materials
were being imported,

00:36:18.615 --> 00:36:21.788
another stimulus to trade;
the cotton from the

00:36:21.788 --> 00:36:24.329
Mediterranean,
the steel from Sweden,

00:36:24.329 --> 00:36:27.757
some specialized high-quality
wools which were used in the

00:36:27.757 --> 00:36:30.597
woolen manufactures--
they came from Spain,

00:36:30.597 --> 00:36:31.570
some of them.
 

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.498
But a great deal of the raw
materials used were being

00:36:34.498 --> 00:36:35.570
produced at home.
 

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:39.280
The period saw a major
expansion in the iron and steel

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.239
industries from the 1670s.
 

00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:45.510
Tin mining down in the
southwest in Cornwall took off;

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:50.027
copper mining expanded;
lead mining in Derbyshire in

00:36:50.027 --> 00:36:54.195
the Midlands,
here, and in north Wales also

00:36:54.195 --> 00:36:57.369
increased very significantly.
 

00:36:57.369 --> 00:37:00.099
And there was a massive growth
in the coal industry,

00:37:00.099 --> 00:37:04.996
coal being the ubiquitous fuel
not only for domestic fires but

00:37:04.996 --> 00:37:08.929
for any industrial process which
required heat.

00:37:08.929 --> 00:37:11.074
They still couldn't use it for
smelting iron,

00:37:11.074 --> 00:37:13.804
but they used it in many other
industrial processes which

00:37:13.804 --> 00:37:15.610
simply required a source of
heat.

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.420
So coal production in Newcastle
in the northeast,

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.974
which had already been a
prodigious half a million tons

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:26.835
in 1650,
was 1.3 million by 1700 and

00:37:26.835 --> 00:37:31.389
over two million by 1750,
and there were significant

00:37:31.389 --> 00:37:34.119
expansions of coal production in
other areas too.

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:38.128
Areas where it hadn't been
previously economical to produce

00:37:38.128 --> 00:37:41.791
and transport coal now got
involved because demand had

00:37:41.791 --> 00:37:42.760
increased.
 

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.329
The coal industry bred other
innovations.

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:48.675
Steam engines were invented at
the end of the seventeenth

00:37:48.675 --> 00:37:52.360
century to drain coal mines;
that was their original purpose.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:55.378
Wooden wagon ways,
railways built of wood along

00:37:55.378 --> 00:37:59.052
which wagons would run to
transport coal more cheaply and

00:37:59.052 --> 00:38:01.472
easily,
wagons pulled by horses,

00:38:01.472 --> 00:38:05.693
were introduced from the 1660s
and were commonplace in the coal

00:38:05.693 --> 00:38:08.960
mining areas by the early
eighteenth century.

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.416
One proud coal owner said that
one of his wagon ways which he'd

00:38:13.416 --> 00:38:17.371
built for several miles to get
his coal to market was as

00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:21.900
prodigious an engineering feat
as the Via Appia near Rome,

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.170
and he was right.
 

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:26.827
Some of these industrial
undertakings were the biggest

00:38:26.827 --> 00:38:31.108
civil engineering projects which
had been undertaken in Britain

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:33.179
since the Romans had left.
 

00:38:33.179 --> 00:38:36.074
Eventually, of course,
you put together the steam

00:38:36.074 --> 00:38:39.210
engines that drained the mines
with the railways,

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.380
the wagon ways that carried the
coal,

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:47.710
and you have locomotives;
George Stephenson.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:51.730
So, in the areas of growth of
this kind,

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:56.112
especially as you have noticed,
areas in the north and in the

00:38:56.112 --> 00:38:59.400
Midlands and in parts of the
West Country,

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.302
the picture is one of what's
been described as industrial

00:39:04.302 --> 00:39:07.759
'agglomeration';
a greater density of

00:39:07.759 --> 00:39:10.860
involvement in particular areas.
 

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.884
And that kind of agglomeration
as more and more communities are

00:39:14.884 --> 00:39:18.000
involved in these activities had
many effects.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.219
It could reduce transportation
costs.

00:39:20.219 --> 00:39:23.070
It could encourage spin-off
developments.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.530
It could encourage the spread
of innovations;

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.594
the transmission of skills
amongst the local population

00:39:29.594 --> 00:39:32.489
well used to its involvement in
these industries;

00:39:32.489 --> 00:39:35.980
the formation of partnerships
to raise capital;

00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:41.936
flows of information regarding
markets and innovative products

00:39:41.936 --> 00:39:43.500
and processes.
 

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:47.259
It resulted eventually in the
creation of highly specialized

00:39:47.259 --> 00:39:50.471
local economies,
distinctive occupational

00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:54.639
regions: the coal mining areas
of the northeast,

00:39:54.639 --> 00:39:57.230
the cloth weaving areas of the
West Country,

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:01.389
the metal ware areas of
Birmingham and so forth.

00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:06.393
These were essentially the
origins of the distinctive

00:40:06.393 --> 00:40:11.496
regional identities of
industrial Britain as it was to

00:40:11.496 --> 00:40:12.170
be.
 

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:15.034
The roots of some of this
activity of course lay deep in

00:40:15.034 --> 00:40:18.630
the past,
especially the cloth industry,

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:24.670
but the period between 1660 and
the mid-eighteenth century saw

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:30.411
the full emergence of all of
this activity as part of a new

00:40:30.411 --> 00:40:33.679
regional economic structure.
 

00:40:33.679 --> 00:40:38.338
Now of course every one of
those zones was centered upon a

00:40:38.338 --> 00:40:41.853
major town or towns,
another part of the story of

00:40:41.853 --> 00:40:44.916
urban growth,
and the interconnections

00:40:44.916 --> 00:40:50.384
between them were facilitated by
the role of towns as central

00:40:50.384 --> 00:40:54.849
places in the circulating
systems of commerce.

00:40:54.849 --> 00:40:59.663
The late seventeenth and very
early eighteenth centuries saw a

00:40:59.663 --> 00:41:03.371
second great wave of
intensification in internal

00:41:03.371 --> 00:41:06.065
trade,
comparable to but exceeding

00:41:06.065 --> 00:41:09.989
that which had taken place in
the late sixteenth century.

00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:14.429
Trade in both agricultural and
industrial products.

00:41:14.429 --> 00:41:18.530
It was a great age of
improvement in communications as

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.780
well as in agriculture and
manufactures.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.096
Without improvement in
communications this kind of

00:41:24.096 --> 00:41:26.650
regional specialization wouldn't
have been possible.

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:30.130
You had to be able to move the
goods around effectively.

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.949
The coastal trade grew
enormously.

00:41:32.949 --> 00:41:38.603
It's been said that the long
coastline of Britain became like

00:41:38.603 --> 00:41:44.070
one great river with coastal
traffic flowing to and fro.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:47.626
Efforts were made also to
improve the navigation of the

00:41:47.626 --> 00:41:50.460
great river systems,
the Thames, the Severn,

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.239
the Trent and so forth.
 

00:41:52.239 --> 00:41:57.067
There were over forty acts of
Parliament for river navigation

00:41:57.067 --> 00:42:01.170
improvement schemes passed
between 1660 and 1700.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.980
Efforts were also made to
improve the roads.

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:08.371
Turnpike trusts were devised as
a way of improving road quality

00:42:08.371 --> 00:42:12.262
by charging a toll,
the money from which would be

00:42:12.262 --> 00:42:15.719
used to maintain a higher
quality highway.

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:18.460
All of the major routes in the
county of Gloucestershire,

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.655
just around Bristol,
were turnpiked between 1690 and

00:42:23.655 --> 00:42:26.065
1740,
to take just one regional

00:42:26.065 --> 00:42:26.639
example.
 

00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:31.402
Every major route there had
been turnpiked and proliferating

00:42:31.402 --> 00:42:35.599
turnpiking was taking place all
over the kingdom,

00:42:35.599 --> 00:42:37.840
radiating out,
in particular,

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.960
from London.
 

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.898
Along those improved roads were
improved regular carrier

00:42:42.898 --> 00:42:47.340
services delivering goods to and
fro throughout the kingdom.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:53.599
So in a sense it was an age of
intensified traffic on all these

00:42:53.599 --> 00:42:58.951
arteries of communication,
by river, around the coast,

00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:01.880
along the turnpike roads.
 

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:07.168
And that inevitably produced an
intensifying relationship of

00:43:07.168 --> 00:43:12.903
exchange between urban and rural
society, between different rural

00:43:12.903 --> 00:43:16.326
regions;
the influence of all of this

00:43:16.326 --> 00:43:21.438
activity percolating right down
to the level of the individual

00:43:21.438 --> 00:43:22.360
village.
 

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:26.344
One indicator of that,
to close, is the proliferation

00:43:26.344 --> 00:43:28.949
of village shops in this period.
 

00:43:28.949 --> 00:43:33.161
It's a period which sees a
proliferation of little shops in

00:43:33.161 --> 00:43:33.960
villages.
 

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.458
For example,
in a far from prominent place

00:43:37.458 --> 00:43:41.639
up here in the Lake District in
the northwest,

00:43:41.639 --> 00:43:46.255
the town of Kirkby Lonsdale,
there was a man called Abraham

00:43:46.255 --> 00:43:51.110
Dent who kept a shop at the turn
of the eighteenth century.

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:52.849
His inventory survives.
 

00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:55.992
It lists all the goods that he
stocked and the suppliers to

00:43:55.992 --> 00:43:58.690
whom he owed money;
very useful.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:03.179
Abraham Dent stocked goods from
fifty-one different origins,

00:44:03.179 --> 00:44:05.309
some of them way overseas.
 

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:08.054
He had his tobacco,
he had his sugar and so forth,

00:44:08.054 --> 00:44:10.349
and many English manufactured
products.

00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:13.668
He had bought goods from one
hundred and ninety different

00:44:13.668 --> 00:44:17.342
suppliers scattered all over the
country and they'd reached him

00:44:17.342 --> 00:44:20.010
in his obscure town in the Lake
District.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:24.590
Such local tradesmen as Abraham
Dent showed how far England's

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:28.711
local economies had moved away
from the era of relative

00:44:28.711 --> 00:44:32.757
self-sufficiency which I
described at the beginning of

00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:36.672
this lecture course,
and the existence of shops like

00:44:36.672 --> 00:44:40.860
Dent's symbolize,
in a sense, the completion of a

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:46.570
massive process of commercial
integration and transition.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.675
John Brewer puts it very well
when he says "the

00:44:49.675 --> 00:44:53.269
shopkeeper linked the market
town and the local community to

00:44:53.269 --> 00:44:56.802
a network of markets that now
stretched beyond the nation's

00:44:56.802 --> 00:44:59.320
boundaries,
across oceans,

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.699
across continents";
and that's correct.

00:45:03.699 --> 00:45:07.199
They linked together the
farmers, the craftspeople,

00:45:07.199 --> 00:45:10.670
the merchants,
the seamen, the hunters,

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:14.851
the plantation slaves,
all linked together in an

00:45:14.851 --> 00:45:18.500
increasingly closely articulated
whole;

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:23.860
a market economy,
a nascent world economy.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.931
Some people describe all this
as "archaic

00:45:26.931 --> 00:45:30.275
globalization,"
some of the earlier stages of

00:45:30.275 --> 00:45:32.050
that familiar process.
 

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:36.894
It's a commercial civilization
in which Britain increasingly

00:45:36.894 --> 00:45:38.619
played a core role.
 

00:45:38.619 --> 00:45:41.137
It was still,
as E.A. Wrigley has put it,

00:45:41.137 --> 00:45:43.340
an "organic economy."
 

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.617
It still depended pretty much
on muscle power,

00:45:46.617 --> 00:45:50.623
human and animal muscles,
or wind and water to power its

00:45:50.623 --> 00:45:52.590
machinery and so forth.
 

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:55.583
It was not yet what he
describes as the

00:45:55.583 --> 00:45:58.655
"mineral-based energy
economy"

00:45:58.655 --> 00:46:01.570
of the Industrial Revolution
era.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:06.300
But if it was still an organic
economy it was a very advanced

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.701
organic economy,
and already in many ways

00:46:09.701 --> 00:46:14.376
beginning to anticipate the
transformations which would come

00:46:14.376 --> 00:46:19.210
in the later eighteenth century
with the introduction of steam

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.510
power and mechanization.
 

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.050
So we'll leave it there.
 

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:28.202
Well, have a good break and
we'll reassemble to get the end

00:46:28.202 --> 00:46:32.641
of the story as far as the state
is concerned in the week after

00:46:32.641 --> 00:46:33.860
Thanksgiving.
 

00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:41.000

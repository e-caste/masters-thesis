00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.001
Prof: So you remember
this slide from several lectures

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:05.370
ago.
 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.340
What are they trying to make?
 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.840
Remember what the point of this
synthesis was,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.140
this particular reaction?
 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.008
The idea was to do a catalytic
reaction with something that was

00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:25.660
chiral as the catalyst,
to do an oxidation on sulfur,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.530
to make a single enantiomer of
omeprazole.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.729
And remember the idea was that
the product,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.969
after you've gone through these
three steps that we showed you

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.372
before,
that the product then comes

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:42.180
back and is the catalyst again,
and you can do another cycle.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.369
So, in fact,
there's this thing called a

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:45.380
catalytic cycle.
 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.563
So what comes in is a peroxide
and a sulfide,

00:00:49.563 --> 00:00:54.602
and what comes out is an
alkoxide and the product that

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:59.821
you want, the oxidized product;
where an oxygen has been added

00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:02.280
to that unshared pair,
that high HOMO.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.841
And so the idea of the chiral
oxidizing agent was so you'd get

00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.610
a single enantiomer of the
product.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.689
But do you remember what
happened?

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:11.980
Student:  It was racemic.
 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.549
Prof: Right,
it gave racemic material.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.659
So what did they do?
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.659
Do you remember?
 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.950
Pardon me?
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.620
Student: 
&gt;.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.640
Prof: Yeah,
ethyldiisopropylamine they

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.411
added;
these researchers added,

00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:29.620
in 2000.
 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.059
And they found out that that
gave a 94% enantiomer excess,

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:36.239
but for no obvious reason.
 

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:40.989
Now it would be great if we
knew what the reason for this

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:41.500
was.
 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.983
And it turned out that,
in fact, this kind of oxidative

00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:48.974
catalytic reaction,
to be stereospecific,

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:52.549
to give a single enantiomer,
was the source of the Nobel

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.610
Prize in 2001.
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.251
And if we click on this thing
here, we can see -- should see

00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:05.620
-- yeah, there we go.
 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.653
So this is the Nobel website,
and you can see that K. Barry

00:02:09.653 --> 00:02:13.619
Sharpless here got the Nobel
Prize in 2001 for his work on

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.750
chirally catalyzed oxidation
reactions;

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.938
so exactly this reaction.
 

00:02:17.938 --> 00:02:23.733
So if anyone can tell us how
ethyldiisopropylamine does its

00:02:23.733 --> 00:02:26.330
trick, who should it be?
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.889
Barry Sharpless, right?
 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.229
&gt;
 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:41.139
&gt;
 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:53.330
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.729
Prof: There,
we're all set.

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:55.848
Prof: Thanks Mike.
 

00:02:55.848 --> 00:02:59.133
Well I'd do anything for my
friend Mike, because he saved me

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:01.750
from publishing errors in JACS
at least once.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.117
And he's saved a lot of us,
who were willing to listen to

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.293
him,
because he's got a genius for

00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:10.740
seeing flaws in the beautiful
stories that people tell,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.316
and then they realize that
their beautiful stories are

00:03:13.316 --> 00:03:14.919
going to be too slick,
usually;

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:17.568
and Nature doesn't like things
to be too slick.

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:23.151
Well I'm going to just use -- I
think the next slide should be

00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:30.074
--
&lt;&lt;Technical

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:37.680
adjustments&gt;&gt;
 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.947
Prof: Well this is
something which we all possibly

00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:42.639
manipulate in-utero.
 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.045
It's interesting,
because many things in our

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:47.923
body,
like a part can be on the left

00:03:47.923 --> 00:03:50.353
or right,
and a mirror image -- I assume

00:03:50.353 --> 00:03:53.378
that means they're mirror-image
related then.

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:57.300
But this is a vein and two
arteries that has a sheath on

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.580
it, and it's the umbilical cord
of a mammal.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.389
And it's got a nice screw axis;
you know how we like to pull

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.538
our hand down a screw axis.
 

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:09.718
And then I have other reasons
why I think I handled it.

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:12.218
And then they take it away from
you at birth;

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.110
they cut it and they take it
away.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.600
It becomes a narcissistically
cathected object.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.870
And that means you're in
trouble because you can't ever

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.959
heal that wound.
 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.360
You want to get it back,
but you can't heal it.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.428
You needed that mirror,
that umbilical cord,

00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:26.970
back there when you were born.
 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.285
Anyway, that's why I went crazy
trying to do asymmetric

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:29.800
synthesis.
 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:37.519
And now, if you're a chemist,
unless you're in deep space --

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:39.509
I don't know if they have any
carbon atoms out there,

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.209
but you got to be in a very
high vacuum to get them.

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:44.867
But this is the way we make
organic compounds,

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:45.339
right?
 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:48.252
But we don't really do it this
way because we have to live on a

00:04:48.252 --> 00:04:49.709
condensed phase of the earth.
 

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:51.980
So these are two -- but you put
them together.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.029
This is a point.
 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:54.720
Then you get a line.
 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.589
It's polyacetylene really.
 

00:04:56.589 --> 00:05:00.310
But let me -- give me poetic
license of just having it be a

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.759
line.
 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.687
And I'll take one unit out,
and now if I add things across

00:05:04.687 --> 00:05:08.682
that line, I get into the plane,
A and B, or I can add them

00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:10.819
cis or trans.
 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.149
And essentially you can make
anything this way,

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:16.290
almost, if you could do it by
just surgically adding things.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.389
Now we're in the plane.
 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.769
And now the job in the plane --
and I've actually drawn a

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:26.420
trans-disubstituted
2-butene.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.350
And it has a shape like this,
right?

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.093
It has a methyl group here,
a methyl group here,

00:05:34.093 --> 00:05:35.319
and then hydrogens.
 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.600
So there's open space in these
quadrants.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.910
And if you look at me coming at
you this way,

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.589
and if I turn around,
you see it's going to be --

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:48.579
well you'll see it's going to
be a mirror image situation.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:49.879
But I'm flat.
 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.990
So I have no chirality,
as a starting point.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.449
I'm in the plane of flat.
 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:59.569
So then if I add hydrogen to
it, I get nothing interesting.

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:02.435
But if I add an atom,
like oxygen,

00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:06.519
to it, like here,
then I've pyramidalized it.

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:10.009
And so I can either add the
oxygen from my front,

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.189
and go like that -- epoxide.
 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:14.759
Or I can add it from my back,
and I go like that.

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.040
And that's the other
mirror-image compound.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:20.120
That's a really cool way.
 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.910
And it works.
 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.339
You can make epoxides that way.
 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:25.519
And we have reagents today
where you can recognize the

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:29.060
front and the back of a flat
object, that has pro-chirality,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.899
like this.
 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.788
And back in the early,
in the mid -- early seventies,

00:06:39.788 --> 00:06:44.060
we saw this industrial reaction
that was nice.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.050
You could take vanadium and
molybdenum,

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.009
and you could epoxidize olefins
with these things called --

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.990
well I don't have the darn
structure unfortunately --

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.680
but it's
t-butylhydroperoxide.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:03.028
It's the alcohol group here,
with a peroxide bond.

00:07:03.028 --> 00:07:06.302
And I think you've already
learned that peroxide bonds are

00:07:06.302 --> 00:07:07.050
weak bonds.
 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.370
They have a low lying
Ïƒ* orbital,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.084
and you can attack them on the
back side and transfer atoms to

00:07:16.084 --> 00:07:20.329
make transfer to carbons,
like a HOMO of an olefin.

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:24.709
So what we noticed -- I noticed
in one case that allylic

00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:28.689
alcohols were very much --
seemed to be special.

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:31.927
It was just noticed by English
chemists in the thirties that

00:07:31.927 --> 00:07:35.000
they seemed to react better than
just normal alcohols.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:42.149
And so, but nobody had taken
any really -- action on that.

00:07:42.149 --> 00:07:45.711
Prof: We're not as fast
as some people at getting to

00:07:45.711 --> 00:07:46.509
this stuff.
 

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:50.209
So we should say that an
allylic alcohol group is one

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:54.410
that has an oxygen on the carbon
next to the double bond.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.550
Prof: Oh, oh yeah.
 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.850
Prof: The OH is --
Prof: Oh right. I forget.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.507
The allylic alcohol -- allylic
means -- allylic,

00:08:01.507 --> 00:08:05.009
you're alpha,
one atom away from an olefin.

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.170
So you could have anything
there;

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.420
nitrogen and oxygen.
 

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.779
So you could have an OH,
like in ethanol;

00:08:10.779 --> 00:08:12.230
that's an allylic alcohol.
 

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:17.120
This is an allylic alcohol
right -- where is it?

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.577
I don't -- see,
I'm sorry, I don't have the

00:08:19.577 --> 00:08:20.689
right structures.
 

00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:21.889
This is the allylic alcohol.
 

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:25.071
It would be, if I go back one;
I'll show you,

00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.990
not by going forward.
 

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.970
Prof: There's the
allylic alcohol actually.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.976
Prof: Yeah,
but I got one -- like here,

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:32.447
this is a carbon,
that's a carbon,

00:08:32.447 --> 00:08:33.340
that's a carbon.
 

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:37.340
By putting an OH group there,
that's allylic alcohol.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.830
If I have another carbon,
it's homoallylic.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:44.542
But it has a handle now,
and that handle allows it to

00:08:44.542 --> 00:08:47.080
grab hold of the vanadium.
 

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.750
The vanadium has all these
alcohol -- these are esters.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.269
Imagine that's phosphorous.
 

00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:53.538
It is like phosphorous actually.
 

00:08:53.538 --> 00:08:59.544
But it's a yellowish liquid,
and it exchanges its ligands

00:08:59.544 --> 00:09:02.870
like the wind,
with alcohols.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.950
So they come in, they go out.
 

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.929
It's a real dance.
 

00:09:04.929 --> 00:09:05.759
It's fast.
 

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:07.308
You don't have to worry about
that happening.

00:09:07.308 --> 00:09:09.159
Phosphates, we'd all be dead if
that happened;

00:09:09.159 --> 00:09:11.460
we'd melt.
 

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.750
But this is a transition metal.
 

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.908
It goes to here.
 

00:09:14.908 --> 00:09:19.474
Now, and when I'm the metal,
and I have oxygen here,

00:09:19.474 --> 00:09:22.070
and then I say have an arm.
 

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:25.961
You can imagine my arm being a
double bond, with Ï€

00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:27.149
going like this.
 

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:31.773
And here, on my belly,
I'm going to have an atom --

00:09:31.773 --> 00:09:36.120
and this is an atom like -- it
should be red.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.450
Oxygen's red.
 

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.000
But he knows why. I don't.
 

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.298
Except for blood.
 

00:09:40.298 --> 00:09:45.595
So you come like this and you
grab it, and it pops off me --

00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:50.621
I'm the activated thing on the
metal -- and it goes on to

00:09:50.621 --> 00:09:51.519
there.
 

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:53.639
That's an epoxide;
a three-membered ring.

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:57.684
And if I attack it with a
backhand, I would get the

00:09:57.684 --> 00:10:00.759
opposite result,
in terms of attack.

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:04.605
And that doesn't happen,
because the geometry of the

00:10:04.605 --> 00:10:08.830
transition states and the
projections of the center --

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.759
you can't get as close to a
center shot on this thing,

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:12.830
with a backhand.
 

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.509
So that's my way of starting to
explain.

00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:16.830
We're going to explain a little
bit more.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:20.208
Mike's going to do some acting
later, and you'll see it a

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:23.830
little bit more clearly -- the
topology of this situation.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.610
But here it's cool because you
get this template.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.690
It's like a mandrel.
 

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.259
You grab hold of this oxygen
atom, which is proto-oxygen.

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:36.159
The metal has lots of empty
orbitals.

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:37.538
It's a d^0 metal.
 

00:10:37.538 --> 00:10:40.464
It activates the thing this
way, and then the olefin

00:10:40.464 --> 00:10:42.816
lone-pair, the HOMO,
attacks the backside,

00:10:42.816 --> 00:10:45.110
and all this funny business
goes on.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.330
But there's no mechanism.
 

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.990
It's a no-mechanism transfer.
 

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.629
It's one of these -- like you
draw a bunch of arrows and

00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:55.610
everything happens sort of in a
smooth way;

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:59.519
no ions involved,
unlike SN_2 chemistry.

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:04.259
Okay, slow step is then this
step.

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:07.216
And then it comes off and more
stuff goes on and it goes

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:07.700
around.
 

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.470
So that's the trick we played
here.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:16.269
The first idea was take
advantage of fixing the thing.

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:20.554
So once you've fixed this flat
system that you want to make go

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:23.335
pop up this way,
or that way,

00:11:23.335 --> 00:11:27.668
now you have a chance of doing
it,

00:11:27.668 --> 00:11:31.179
because the thing you're
transferring from can recognize

00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:33.791
this kind of situation,
from that one,

00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:37.190
by -- it's part of the same
molecule temporarily.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.999
In fact, it's a covalent bond,
right there,

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:41.070
at this point.
 

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.730
Too much, I always say too much.
 

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.808
Okay, let's keep going.
 

00:11:43.808 --> 00:11:48.320
Then came a great man from
Japan.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.340
He's now a head professor at
Kyoto, Oshima.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.428
He was a fantastic boiler room
producer in titanium,

00:11:55.428 --> 00:11:57.019
osmium;
you name it.

00:11:57.019 --> 00:12:00.974
I think that was where all the
work was done for the Nobel

00:12:00.974 --> 00:12:02.820
Prize;
it was done at MIT.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.408
But it happened at Stanford;
just because I was there for a

00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:05.840
few years.
 

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.342
But you know those early years
in your career,

00:12:08.342 --> 00:12:11.514
when you do your work in the
boiler room, are what produce

00:12:11.514 --> 00:12:11.960
you.
 

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.116
Like your personality doesn't
change after you're four years

00:12:15.116 --> 00:12:15.919
old -- right?
 

00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:19.975
-- or three years old;
you're pretty much locked in,

00:12:19.975 --> 00:12:22.580
unfortunately,
in some ways.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.186
This is vanadium system,
and we put on this chiral

00:12:26.186 --> 00:12:29.129
machinery here,
and it gave us 80% ee;

00:12:29.129 --> 00:12:34.474
that means enantiomeric excess
was -- it was 90% one isomer --

00:12:34.474 --> 00:12:39.029
enantiomer, the right hand say,
and 10% the other.

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:40.830
And this looks good.
 

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:45.466
But it only works for that one
substrate, and all the other

00:12:45.466 --> 00:12:49.302
types with it -- you can have
like methyls there,

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:52.740
or a methyl there,
and you get nothing.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.928
So you have to get everything
customized.

00:12:54.928 --> 00:12:56.581
This ligand,
you got to get the right

00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:59.149
ligand, the -- and that's what
you expect with Nature.

00:12:59.149 --> 00:13:02.278
We're taught by Emil Fisher --
the lock and key.

00:13:02.278 --> 00:13:06.803
Nature is supposed to be very,
very touchy about changing her

00:13:06.803 --> 00:13:07.860
preferences.
 

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.289
And that was what we expected.
 

00:13:09.289 --> 00:13:10.418
Well I didn't expect that.
 

00:13:10.418 --> 00:13:13.927
I expected that this type of
olefin and this type,

00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:16.932
with something,
that all these would need a

00:13:16.932 --> 00:13:18.580
class of catalysts.
 

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.370
There are about six shapes of
olefins.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.548
So that's what my dream was,
to get maybe six catalysts.

00:13:23.548 --> 00:13:26.404
Because we didn't have the
paraphernalia that nature has

00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:27.080
all around.
 

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.038
Well for years we tried.
 

00:13:30.038 --> 00:13:31.678
Ten years we didn't get
anything.

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:36.519
It was always this game of like
almost no reliability.

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:39.635
And then when we came to
titanium -- we'd been working

00:13:39.635 --> 00:13:41.460
with vanadium and molybdenum.
 

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.169
We came over to titanium,
and we put in tartaric acid

00:13:46.169 --> 00:13:47.620
ester one day.
 

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:49.379
This wasn't me, it was Katsuki.
 

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:51.899
He should've gotten the Nobel
Prize with me,

00:13:51.899 --> 00:13:55.220
because this means half of this
-- I picked the right metal,

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.370
at that time,
and the right system,

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.250
but he's the one who picked the
right ligand.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.668
And let's go on to the next
thing.

00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:04.720
You'll see, this is tartaric
acid.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.009
This is so-called natural.
 

00:14:06.009 --> 00:14:07.450
It comes from grapes.
 

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:08.879
It's the cream of tartar.
 

00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:11.429
When you protonate it,
it becomes tartaric acid.

00:14:11.429 --> 00:14:12.940
Over here is the unnatural.
 

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.530
But there's a plant in Africa,
Bauhinia reticulata,

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.058
that has about -- it's a huge
area, around the Sahara.

00:14:20.058 --> 00:14:23.404
So there's maybe more of that
so-called unnatural than there

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:24.538
is of the natural.
 

00:14:24.538 --> 00:14:28.570
You know the story about
tartaric acid.

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.623
And it goes way back to Louis
Pasteur, with the discovery of

00:14:31.623 --> 00:14:35.340
tetrahedral carbon;
I mean then the precursor to it.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:37.918
Grapes, very sexy looking
things.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.942
We always like -- humans seem
to like to drink them,

00:14:40.942 --> 00:14:42.899
and eat them,
and look at them.

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:47.970
This is the famous recipe.
 

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:51.940
So that day,
Katsuki took a tartrate and put

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:57.850
it together with -- oh I think I
forgot to say something here.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:01.230
Yeah, just quickly.
 

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.659
Maybe I don't have it.
 

00:15:02.659 --> 00:15:04.070
No, it comes later. Okay.
 

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:08.899
TBHP was the kind of oxygen
we'd always been using.

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:11.682
There's the titanium,
which comes from titanium

00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:13.860
dioxide or titanium
tetrachloride.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.331
Everything that's white in this
world, all these -- that's

00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:18.490
titanium dioxide.
 

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.529
It's the only white pigment
anybody ever uses.

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:25.149
And so that's titanium dioxide.
 

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:25.990
It's very insoluble.
 

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.470
But you can make it into this
soluble derivative,

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.789
if you do the right chemistry.
 

00:15:31.789 --> 00:15:33.668
And this is the wine acid.
 

00:15:33.668 --> 00:15:36.048
We put in diisopropyl tartrate
as an ester,

00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:40.210
and we kept getting 90%,
100%, 95 --

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.460
every olefin we put in that was
an allylic alcohol,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.908
that had this handle on it,
gave Katsuki --

00:15:47.908 --> 00:15:50.058
about a week of this,
and we were just about dying.

00:15:50.058 --> 00:15:53.409
I was looking at him;
he was looking at me.

00:15:53.409 --> 00:15:55.600
We didn't believe it, you know.
 

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.490
So we had to try to kill this.
 

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:57.970
But it was right.
 

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.808
And so it meant that here we
had some new principle.

00:16:01.808 --> 00:16:05.269
We could actually just take one
catalyst and get them all;

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:06.750
almost get them all.
 

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:08.090
But they had to be allylic
alcohols.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:14.549
So this is the famous recipe
discovered I think on an October

00:16:14.549 --> 00:16:17.350
day in 1980 at Stanford.
 

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:19.288
I'd already decided to go back
to MIT.

00:16:19.288 --> 00:16:22.288
I might not have decided to do
that, if this had happened

00:16:22.288 --> 00:16:22.769
sooner.
 

00:16:22.769 --> 00:16:24.639
We get depressed when our
research isn't working;

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:26.899
I mean, whether we don't show
it or not.

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:30.645
It's the only thing that
matters really to a real killer

00:16:30.645 --> 00:16:34.255
research guy who wants to
understand what makes nature

00:16:34.255 --> 00:16:34.870
tick.
 

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.980
And whatever else -- if that's
going well, life is good.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.750
Otherwise nothing's good.
 

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:44.076
So I went back to MIT,
which I wouldn't have if I'd

00:16:44.076 --> 00:16:47.470
gotten this about three months
earlier, probably.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:49.080
And here we are.
 

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.855
There's Katsuki-san drinking
tartaric aqueous -- it's about

00:16:52.855 --> 00:16:56.240
5% aqueous tartaric acid -- in
wine and champagne.

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.916
And this was on the porch at
the Mudd Building,

00:16:58.916 --> 00:17:01.360
which was where our lab was,
on the top.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:05.577
And what I'm going to show here
is why Katsuki was so important,

00:17:05.577 --> 00:17:06.650
in a nutshell.
 

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.769
This is really a nice little
substrate.

00:17:08.769 --> 00:17:13.549
It has this type of alcohol;
it's trisubstituted.

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:14.970
But you see the OH here?
 

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:16.740
There's no OH over here.
 

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.788
This is a more reactive olefin
for the transfer of the oxygen,

00:17:20.788 --> 00:17:22.980
but it doesn't have the handle.
 

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.256
So this one ends up winning by
a factor of 200,

00:17:26.256 --> 00:17:30.102
in this system where the
epoxidation requires the thing

00:17:30.102 --> 00:17:32.880
to bind and go in
intramolecularly.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.150
And that's nice in its own
right, but to get -- we got

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.297
racemate all the time,
of course, because we have no

00:17:39.297 --> 00:17:40.470
face selection.
 

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:46.298
And titanium goes about ten
times faster with tartrate.

00:17:46.298 --> 00:17:48.890
When you add it,
this does something to make --

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.185
every other metal,
years before Oshima had taken

00:17:52.185 --> 00:17:55.663
vanadium and molybdenum,
which were the best for

00:17:55.663 --> 00:17:57.250
isolated double bonds.
 

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.838
But you put tartrate in,
it kills them.

00:17:59.838 --> 00:18:03.400
So my instinct would not have
been to put tartrate in again.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.515
This is the kind of thing --
everything in science,

00:18:06.515 --> 00:18:08.509
the rules change all the time.
 

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:11.211
You wake up in the morning --
you should iterate your favorite

00:18:11.211 --> 00:18:12.230
desire every morning.
 

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.960
It's going to look different to
you in the shower.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:19.851
And you can never -- the atomic
bomb was made by theoretical

00:18:19.851 --> 00:18:20.950
geniuses.
 

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.744
But the guys who did it,
actually they had aluminum foil

00:18:23.744 --> 00:18:25.930
on the source,
and they kept it on there for

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:27.150
about a year or two.
 

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.637
Some guy said,
"No, I don't think we need

00:18:28.637 --> 00:18:28.868
this.
 

00:18:28.868 --> 00:18:30.009
What about if we take it
off?"

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:31.369
That was the answer.
 

00:18:31.369 --> 00:18:32.900
I mean, these guys are like us.
 

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.941
They just try this,
try that, in the lab.

00:18:34.941 --> 00:18:35.348
Right?
 

00:18:35.348 --> 00:18:38.700
That's what gets really things
done in this world.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:40.788
The theories are important.
 

00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:43.308
Nobody would even think about
trying it without the theory.

00:18:43.308 --> 00:18:45.941
But -- okay,
"A man in California just

00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:49.200
won a Nobel Prize for mixing
paint and wine!"

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.859
That's what they said,
in the LA Times.

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:53.759
It's sort of true.
 

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:55.920
Titanium dioxide and tartaric
acid.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.951
And there's the -- I like my
students to know where Mother

00:18:59.951 --> 00:19:00.730
Earth is.
 

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.890
And I like things to be cheap.
 

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:07.070
I don't like to be far away
from a river that's strong,

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:09.673
or a power source;
or in this case,

00:19:09.673 --> 00:19:11.190
this is tartaric acid.
 

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.558
It comes in 100-pound bags.
 

00:19:12.558 --> 00:19:15.328
This is Spanish tartar,
and this is Victor Martin,

00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:18.550
who's one of the heroes of this
chemistry, from the Canary

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.230
Islands.
 

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.710
This comes to Pfizer.
 

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:22.380
They make things out of it.
 

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.048
But it comes in ships in
100-pound bags.

00:19:25.048 --> 00:19:28.088
And we still have that in our
stockroom somewhere.

00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:33.064
There's my daughter celebrating
the synthesis of the unnatural

00:19:33.064 --> 00:19:35.592
sugars &gt;
 

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:37.058
by this method.
 

00:19:37.058 --> 00:19:40.130
And oh I got the wrong one,
didn't I?

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:42.894
I threw out the wrong -- yeah,
anyway, you're going to have to

00:19:42.894 --> 00:19:43.440
interpret.
 

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.979
This is the mirror-image of the
picture that was taken,

00:19:45.979 --> 00:19:48.050
I guess;
because you see the name over

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.098
here is backwards.
 

00:19:49.098 --> 00:19:51.430
But she's looking at the
l-sugars.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:52.670
These are the ones we don't
make.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.269
There's eight of those,
the hexoses.

00:19:54.269 --> 00:19:57.608
And these are the ones Emil
Fisher made, in his famous work;

00:19:57.608 --> 00:20:00.170
about the best chemist who ever
lived,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.200
except for van't Hoff,
who was even better,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.897
because he did organic
stereochemistry and physical

00:20:04.897 --> 00:20:06.913
chemistry,
and I think he was the greatest

00:20:06.913 --> 00:20:09.500
chemist who ever lived;
van't Hoff was.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.271
But anyway, Fisher was better
than anybody who lived in this

00:20:13.271 --> 00:20:16.532
century, in terms of
understanding and arguments and

00:20:16.532 --> 00:20:18.259
rationale of synthesis.
 

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:21.289
And he made a lot of these
sugars over here.

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:24.250
But this is Tito Simboli.
 

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.410
She's a photographer,
my wife's friend.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.700
This is taken in 1983.
 

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.329
It was on the cover of
Chemistry in Britain.

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:32.900
And Hannah was seven.
 

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:36.319
And anyway, Tito was a friend.
 

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.519
So she took the picture.
 

00:20:37.519 --> 00:20:39.744
And this book though,
is a huge book,

00:20:39.744 --> 00:20:43.207
which was gotten by Nancy
Schrock, who's in charge of the

00:20:43.207 --> 00:20:45.680
MIT Archives and is a book
restorer.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.557
And Nancy -- so here we got
Nancy Schrock,

00:20:48.557 --> 00:20:52.279
we got Tito Simboli,
whose husband is Dan McFadden;

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:55.382
won the Nobel Prize in
economics ten years later,

00:20:55.382 --> 00:20:58.614
and Dick won the Nobel Prize a
couple of years ago,

00:20:58.614 --> 00:21:00.230
and I won it in 2001.
 

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.150
So the picture is kind of
connected.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.180
And there's Lewis Carroll,
of course, looking-glass milk.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.910
And Emil Fisher.
 

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:08.912
It's a heavy duty picture;
for me anyway.

00:21:08.912 --> 00:21:10.278
&gt;
 

00:21:10.278 --> 00:21:13.675
There's Nexium,
and maybe we're getting -- I

00:21:13.675 --> 00:21:16.519
went too far into the other
stuff.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.301
But here's the atom,
the red atom,

00:21:18.301 --> 00:21:21.490
that's going to end up being
transferred onto the sulfur.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:30.228
And well Mike showed -- told
you that the diisopropylamine --

00:21:30.228 --> 00:21:33.868
what would its role be?
 

00:21:33.868 --> 00:21:36.368
I hope I can go to the board
now and show you a few things.

00:21:36.368 --> 00:21:39.170
But this catalyst is exactly
the recipe.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.413
And it makes billions of
dollars a year,

00:21:41.413 --> 00:21:42.162
this product.
 

00:21:42.162 --> 00:21:42.680
Right?
 

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.198
But the patent is -- the
Stanford patent is no longer

00:21:46.198 --> 00:21:46.740
valid.
 

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.583
It's run out;
even though it hadn't run out

00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:50.509
when they started.
 

00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:53.490
But they didn't believe that it
might.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.154
This was an infringing of that
patent actually in the

00:21:56.154 --> 00:21:56.769
beginning.
 

00:21:56.769 --> 00:21:59.069
But nobody in universities sues
companies.

00:21:59.069 --> 00:22:00.019
They can't afford to.
 

00:22:00.019 --> 00:22:01.769
Stanford couldn't afford to.
 

00:22:01.769 --> 00:22:02.759
Prof: Do you want to go
to the board now?

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:04.548
Prof: Should I? Yeah.
 

00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:36.420
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.900
Prof: Do you remember
the vanadium picture?

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.170
I'll make it titanium now.
 

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:44.690
But there's this alcohol group
and --

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:51.368
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:22:51.368 --> 00:22:56.086
Prof: And on this we
have this peroxide group that's

00:22:56.086 --> 00:22:59.259
bound, and it's bound datively
there.

00:22:59.259 --> 00:23:01.470
It's got this tertiary-butyl
group here.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:11.347
And then the alcohol is bound
here, and well it goes sort of

00:23:11.347 --> 00:23:12.519
down.
 

00:23:12.519 --> 00:23:17.328
I'll just try to show some of
the stereochemistry.

00:23:17.328 --> 00:23:23.260
And then underneath it's coming
-- yeah, it's coming folded like

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.048
this, underneath.
 

00:23:25.048 --> 00:23:28.375
I can't draw very well,
but this is supposed to be

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:31.769
coming with its lone pairs,
it's Ï€ bonds,

00:23:31.769 --> 00:23:34.009
on the backside of this bond.
 

00:23:34.009 --> 00:23:38.548
So we're going to do an attack
on there, and we'll break this

00:23:38.548 --> 00:23:43.538
bond, we'll bring the lone pair
here in, and we get the epoxide.

00:23:43.538 --> 00:23:46.896
Now, but the thing about this
is patent lawyers can be very

00:23:46.896 --> 00:23:49.046
creative --
like every field has creative

00:23:49.046 --> 00:23:51.990
people,
and Yale is connected to this

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:53.608
fellow,
Bert Rowland.

00:23:53.608 --> 00:23:57.079
And he was in Palo Alto at the
time, at a company,

00:23:57.079 --> 00:24:00.550
and he had just gotten famous,
or almost infamous,

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.809
because that patent was really
aggressive;

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:06.170
this Boyer-Cohen Patent.
 

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.288
He wrote the Boyer-Cohen Patent.
 

00:24:07.288 --> 00:24:09.960
He's related to Mike,
because he got his Ph.D.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.970
with Bartlett at Harvard,
like Mike did.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:14.038
So that's a long time ago.
 

00:24:14.038 --> 00:24:16.140
That's a great-something
relationship.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.269
And then comes Wiberg,
who's here at Yale.

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:23.170
He was at Seattle then,
and he took a post-doc.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:25.299
He decided he liked chemistry
in principle.

00:24:25.299 --> 00:24:27.670
He was smart;
a physical-organic chemist.

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:29.888
But he didn't like the lab;
he wasn't any good in the lab

00:24:29.888 --> 00:24:30.970
and he didn't like to be there.
 

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.809
So he became a patent attorney,
and did very well.

00:24:33.809 --> 00:24:36.410
And he writes great patents.
 

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:39.650
And so he read our paper,
our first paper.

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:40.920
We gave him the little
communication.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.674
And then he got Katsuki and me
over to his office,

00:24:45.674 --> 00:24:50.140
and he interviewed us for about
ten minutes.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.920
The next day we got a patent.
 

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.368
He never changed a word of it.
 

00:24:53.368 --> 00:24:55.808
And I'll tell you why it's
creative, I think.

00:24:55.808 --> 00:24:59.420
We're getting ready for the
Nexium.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.150
But I could tell you about that.
 

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.890
If we don't make it,
it won't matter that much.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.778
But here's the main -- so this
is going to be the oxygen;

00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:10.529
and they should be red but we
have pink here.

00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:11.690
So does this one.
 

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:13.019
But that one doesn't transfer.
 

00:25:13.019 --> 00:25:14.088
This is the one that transfers.
 

00:25:14.088 --> 00:25:20.078
So what Rowland said is you got
a metal, which can grab things.

00:25:20.078 --> 00:25:22.876
Now the things it grabs,
it could be X,

00:25:22.876 --> 00:25:26.557
it could be sulfur,
or an amine group that it could

00:25:26.557 --> 00:25:27.220
grab.
 

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:30.133
And then he just drew -- I
think he drew a carbon with no

00:25:30.133 --> 00:25:31.588
-- it could be any carbon.
 

00:25:31.588 --> 00:25:34.799
It didn't have to have to have
just CH_2.

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:38.868
And then he drew this, G.
 

00:25:38.868 --> 00:25:42.680
And then he drew -- yeah,
he did draw an oxygen atom

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.519
here, I guess,
but it was activated.

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:48.773
And so this oxygen,
he didn't have a generality

00:25:48.773 --> 00:25:49.339
there.
 

00:25:49.339 --> 00:25:50.368
That was specific.
 

00:25:50.368 --> 00:25:52.092
That was the only thing that
was specific,

00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:52.890
these two things.
 

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.359
So this could be any kind of
lone pair.

00:25:55.359 --> 00:25:56.650
An olefin is a lone pair.
 

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.150
Sulfur has a lone pair.
 

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.329
Phosphorous has a lone pair.
 

00:25:59.329 --> 00:26:00.430
Nitrogen has a lone pair.
 

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:02.416
And sure enough,
when I read that,

00:26:02.416 --> 00:26:05.430
I said, "My God,
this gives us ideas."

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.799
So we started doing amino
alcohols.

00:26:07.799 --> 00:26:08.970
All these things work.
 

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:09.778
You know?
 

00:26:09.778 --> 00:26:12.180
So this is from Bert Rowland,
the patent attorney.

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:16.000
He was a co-inventor of those
other reactions.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.039
We never wrote any more patents.
 

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.390
It's a good thing.
 

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.660
Don't waste your time on
patents.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.318
They'll just not use them until
they expire.

00:26:22.318 --> 00:26:25.028
And we never -- we made enough
to go on a vacation once a year,

00:26:25.028 --> 00:26:26.209
in a car, not too far away.
 

00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:27.390
&gt;
 

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.440
Katsuki and I,
we got -- people think we got

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.098
rich.
 

00:26:32.098 --> 00:26:35.094
We got the most -- one year we
got $20,000 each,

00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:36.048
or something.
 

00:26:36.048 --> 00:26:39.487
That was a really sharp
maximum, from the bag-a-bug

00:26:39.487 --> 00:26:42.098
gypsy moth traps â€“
Disparlure.

00:26:42.098 --> 00:26:47.112
But okay, to show the transfer,
I think maybe it would be nice

00:26:47.112 --> 00:26:51.056
for us, Mike and I,
to show what features have to

00:26:51.056 --> 00:26:53.848
be over here in these ligands.
 

00:26:53.848 --> 00:26:56.970
You see, the tartrate has this
feature.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.400
It grabs the titanium,
like out front.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.730
Let's kind of put it out front
here.

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:04.910
So the titanium is out here.
 

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.286
And down in the back here you
have this ester group,

00:27:08.286 --> 00:27:11.396
and up in the back,
over here, you have an ester

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:12.058
group.
 

00:27:12.058 --> 00:27:14.460
And I can't remember if that's
what we planned to do.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.846
But out here,
on the front,

00:27:15.846 --> 00:27:18.087
it's coming -- the alcohol --
this G-group,

00:27:18.087 --> 00:27:20.328
and there's an oxygen that's
hot over here,

00:27:20.328 --> 00:27:21.930
that can be transferred.
 

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:27.019
So Mike's going to put that --
I'm going to put that on and --

00:27:27.019 --> 00:27:28.150
Prof: I'm the olefin.
 

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.665
Prof: Yeah,
you're the -- is that okay if

00:27:29.665 --> 00:27:30.900
you're the ole--
Prof: It's okay.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.974
Prof: Maybe it's better
if I'm the olefin.

00:27:32.974 --> 00:27:34.098
&gt;
 

00:27:34.098 --> 00:27:35.540
Prof: No,
okay.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:37.118
I'll be the titanium.
 

00:27:37.118 --> 00:27:38.009
Prof: Yeah,
you're the titanium.

00:27:38.009 --> 00:27:40.708
Prof: So see,
I've got this oxygen that wants

00:27:40.708 --> 00:27:42.720
to go off, because it's a weak
bond.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.380
And I've got to get it over to
him.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.058
He's the allylic alcohol.
 

00:27:48.058 --> 00:27:50.269
But we're going to pretend he
doesn't have to bind to me.

00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:52.319
We're just going to do this
straight-out attack here.

00:27:52.319 --> 00:27:58.000
And yeah, it's like that. Right?
 

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.724
So I'm blocked here,
but I'm open in these

00:27:59.724 --> 00:28:00.230
quadrants.
 

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.430
Prof: So you're natural
tartaric acid.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.276
Prof: Is that right?
 

00:28:03.276 --> 00:28:03.838
Boy you're quick.
 

00:28:03.838 --> 00:28:05.390
I don't -- okay,
so I'm natural?

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.690
&gt;
 

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.308
Prof: Okay,
well wait a minute.

00:28:08.308 --> 00:28:10.730
And also, but I'm not like
this, I'm like that.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.099
You see, I'm in a
three-dimensional world,

00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:14.720
because I'm tartaric acid.
 

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.970
So I'm sticking out here.
 

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.358
So I'm a chiral object now.
 

00:28:17.358 --> 00:28:19.549
My mirror-image won't
superimpose.

00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:22.049
But he's, yeah he's that way.
 

00:28:22.049 --> 00:28:24.368
He's a trans-olefin.
 

00:28:24.368 --> 00:28:26.221
&gt;
 

00:28:26.221 --> 00:28:29.848
And he looks like an Egyptian,
like -- anyway.

00:28:29.848 --> 00:28:31.480
Prof: I have a double
bond here, right?

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.200
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.182
Prof: The question is
whether you're going to come on

00:28:34.182 --> 00:28:34.890
here or on my back.
 

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.403
Prof: Actually the
double -- we don't have this

00:28:36.403 --> 00:28:36.746
quite right.
 

00:28:36.746 --> 00:28:37.660
Can you get an arm down here?
 

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.288
Because the double bonds is
here.

00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:40.424
Prof: No,
no, the double bond is going

00:28:40.424 --> 00:28:40.710
this way.
 

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:41.295
Prof: Okay.
 

00:28:41.295 --> 00:28:42.269
You've got it going that way.
 

00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:43.930
Prof: So here, right now.
 

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.034
Prof: Okay,
so yeah double bond's going

00:28:46.034 --> 00:28:46.454
that way.
 

00:28:46.454 --> 00:28:46.828
Okay.
 

00:28:46.828 --> 00:28:47.058
Prof: Thank you.
 

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:48.400
So you --
Prof: Yeah, that's good.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.328
Prof: Get your tartrate
on.

00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:52.337
Prof: Okay,
because I could go like -- I

00:28:52.337 --> 00:28:54.890
may not -- it's like this,
I'm sorry.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.299
Yeah, I got to go like that.
 

00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:57.430
I could go like that.
 

00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:58.358
That's the mirror-image.
 

00:28:58.358 --> 00:29:00.180
Okay, now I'm coming towards
him.

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:02.269
Prof: But I want to go
on my back.

00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:03.950
Prof: Okay,
you want it on your back?

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:04.809
Oh my gosh.
 

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:08.598
Oh I can't do it. See?
 

00:29:08.598 --> 00:29:11.306
But that's the other -- you
need the other mirror-image for

00:29:11.306 --> 00:29:11.818
that one.
 

00:29:11.818 --> 00:29:15.653
So I come this way,
and I can -- it says

00:29:15.653 --> 00:29:18.109
"Think Safety".
 

00:29:18.109 --> 00:29:18.700
Oh.
 

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:23.115
So now you have to -- yeah,
if he was a good yoga person,

00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:26.270
he could pyramidalize it a
little better.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.480
&gt;
 

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.760
Yet now when you put him that
way, he's one enantiomer,

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.922
and if you put him on the other
way, that's the other

00:29:34.922 --> 00:29:35.589
enantiomer.
 

00:29:35.589 --> 00:29:36.319
Simple.
 

00:29:36.319 --> 00:29:37.220
It's real simple, isn't it?
 

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.250
Thanks Mike.
 

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.044
Yeah, we just organized that
ten seconds before we came over,

00:29:43.044 --> 00:29:44.118
as you can see.
 

00:29:44.118 --> 00:29:46.940
We didn't have any red ping
pong balls.

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.140
It's good with Velcro.
 

00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.230
You can do it with Velcro.
 

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.150
We did it once with Velcro red
balls.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:55.099
Okay now.
 

00:29:55.099 --> 00:29:59.730
Prof: Back to the screen.
 

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:01.884
Prof: Yeah,
I think we're -- oh no,

00:30:01.884 --> 00:30:03.410
I'm not back to the screen.
 

00:30:03.410 --> 00:30:04.579
Let's leave it alone.
 

00:30:04.579 --> 00:30:09.871
This is going to be a little --
&lt;&lt;Technical

00:30:09.871 --> 00:30:13.190
adjustments&gt;&gt;
 

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:19.068
Prof: Now if you look at
the structure of the omeprazole.

00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:21.670
I won't put all the bells and
whistles on it.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:25.700
It's an imidazole structure,
benzimidazole,

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:29.730
which has a benzene ring,
two nitrogens.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:34.200
It's a five-membered aromatic
heterocycle.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:39.910
And so you have a double bond
and one H.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.358
And I can't remember what's on
the sulfur.

00:30:43.358 --> 00:30:46.019
Is it an aromatic ring,
or is it a benzyl?

00:30:46.019 --> 00:30:49.180
It's an aromatic benzyl thing,
I think.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.960
And you might look at this and
say, "This doesn't look

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.308
anything like Bert Rowland's
thing there."

00:30:54.308 --> 00:30:58.813
Because where are the anchor
points that we need,

00:30:58.813 --> 00:31:01.910
the group that binds the metal?
 

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.078
We have the lone pairs all
right;

00:31:04.078 --> 00:31:07.980
you know, two lone pairs,
rabbit ears.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:14.306
And there, if you put oxygen on
one side, it's the same story as

00:31:14.306 --> 00:31:15.210
before.
 

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.109
This isn't flat to start with.
 

00:31:17.109 --> 00:31:19.430
But now we have these pairs.
 

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.588
If you put something here,
you get one enantiomer.

00:31:21.588 --> 00:31:23.288
You put something there,
you get the other.

00:31:23.288 --> 00:31:28.528
So the idea was to try to get
-- and Kagan had done this.

00:31:28.528 --> 00:31:30.838
He's a fellow that could've won
the Nobel Prize,

00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:31.920
I thought should of.
 

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.160
But he's in France.
 

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.358
And he had done a lot of great
work in asymmetric chemistry.

00:31:37.358 --> 00:31:42.130
And he took the titanium
tartrate catalyst of Katsuki,

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.048
and he found if you put a
little water in it,

00:31:44.048 --> 00:31:47.009
and you did the right things,
and wished --

00:31:47.009 --> 00:31:49.798
it wasn't as general,
but he got very good asymmetric

00:31:49.798 --> 00:31:50.390
addition.
 

00:31:50.390 --> 00:31:53.608
So titanium was already known
to do this.

00:31:53.608 --> 00:31:58.519
But the feature that's
important here is the pKa of

00:31:58.519 --> 00:32:03.528
this benzimidazole is probably
-- I looked it up;

00:32:03.528 --> 00:32:05.680
I think it's below that of an
alcohol.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:10.308
So that means it can go on the
titanium, reversibly.

00:32:10.308 --> 00:32:13.865
So you see the titanium has
alcohols on it,

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:18.269
or ligands like this,
or -- and this can exchange.

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:22.928
So we can have that come off,
and this N go on,

00:32:22.928 --> 00:32:27.788
for this heterocycle,
and the benzene ring's down

00:32:27.788 --> 00:32:28.700
here.
 

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:33.460
And now we have something like
that, a covalent bond.

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:41.460
And we've got the sulfur here,
and we also have the alcohol.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.970
So there's an equilibrium where
you could invoke that.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:48.798
But this is not as easy to
probably do as an alcohol.

00:32:48.798 --> 00:32:51.443
It's more encumbered,
and it's probably -- kinetics

00:32:51.443 --> 00:32:53.453
are slower for this,
and off of oxygen,

00:32:53.453 --> 00:32:55.940
for the hydrogen transfers that
are needed.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.460
So I hypothesize here that what
the diisopropyl -- what the

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.642
Hünig's base,
we call it

00:33:02.642 --> 00:33:05.368
diisopropylethylamine is doing.
 

00:33:05.368 --> 00:33:09.957
This is such a hindered amine
that it can't react with

00:33:09.957 --> 00:33:13.940
anything, but it's good for
getting protons.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.759
So it can't itself get at the
oxygen;

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:17.180
which you would worry about.
 

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.558
It would make an N-oxide.
 

00:33:18.558 --> 00:33:21.220
And it can't bind to the
titanium anyway.

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:23.548
Titanium hates nitrogen.
 

00:33:23.548 --> 00:33:27.720
If you have an oxygen around,
it'll spit it out so fast it'll

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.250
make your head spin.
 

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:32.703
I mean, this thing is amazing
hating nitrogen -- titanium,

00:33:32.703 --> 00:33:35.308
and silicon too,
but especially titanium.

00:33:35.308 --> 00:33:38.170
So it's never going to get
involved with titanium.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.358
So what's it going to do?
 

00:33:39.358 --> 00:33:44.256
Well remember when you try to
get chemistry going in a system

00:33:44.256 --> 00:33:49.558
like this, this amine has enough
pKa power to pull this proton.

00:33:49.558 --> 00:33:53.130
And usually you could write a
concerted mechanism.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:56.259
Like let me erase some of this
and have some room here.

00:33:56.259 --> 00:33:59.839
Well I shouldn't erase that.
 

00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:00.470
I'll go over here.
 

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.251
You got this benzimidazole,
with a sulfur here,

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:17.929
and I'm going to put the
hydrogen up here.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.653
Whenever you engage compounds
in reaction, acid-base

00:34:22.653 --> 00:34:27.563
reactions, you look for the
basic sites and the acidic

00:34:27.563 --> 00:34:28.489
sites.
 

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:29.690
There's the acidic site.
 

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.840
You might think that's where
the titanium goes.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.385
But usually the mechanism for
these reactions involves a

00:34:36.385 --> 00:34:39.739
simultaneous loss of this
proton, and attack here.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.518
This is the place you can
attack.

00:34:41.518 --> 00:34:44.110
So you'll be attacking the
titanium here,

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:48.750
and you're going to get some
help from --

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.550
you're going to get a lot of
help from this amine,

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.280
because you can put it
someplace;

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:55.280
just take it right off.
 

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.309
But you'll have some of that
ammonium salt around too,

00:34:58.309 --> 00:34:59.909
a little bit,
transiently.

00:34:59.909 --> 00:35:07.023
And this will help you,
because you need to move things

00:35:07.023 --> 00:35:08.210
around.
 

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:12.199
That's why this reaction was
not good without that amine.

00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:15.353
You need to scramble the system
and keep it rolling,

00:35:15.353 --> 00:35:17.579
so that the things get on and
off.

00:35:17.579 --> 00:35:21.615
Catalysis often has this --
like there's six,

00:35:21.615 --> 00:35:22.349
maybe.
 

00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:24.815
There's always a loop,
and if you look at any

00:35:24.815 --> 00:35:27.280
catalytic cycle,
there'll be usually one step

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.139
that's really bad news,
until you get it fixed.

00:35:30.139 --> 00:35:33.650
And that step is where it
controls the rate.

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:37.594
If you get steady state,
the slowest step -- this is a

00:35:37.594 --> 00:35:39.679
real democracy,
catalysis.

00:35:39.679 --> 00:35:43.329
There's no step that's more
important than any other.

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:44.730
The catalyst goes from each
step.

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:46.980
The titanium is moving through
those cycles.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.485
If there's a slow step,
there's 99.9% of the titaniums

00:35:50.485 --> 00:35:53.463
that you need,
stuck before this one mountain,

00:35:53.463 --> 00:35:56.110
that goes way up like Mount
Everest.

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:57.849
You got to drop that one down.
 

00:35:57.849 --> 00:36:00.110
If you get that one down,
the rate goes way up.

00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:02.356
And if you get them all the
same height, you're really

00:36:02.356 --> 00:36:02.780
rolling.
 

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.190
And that's a sacred rule.
 

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:09.489
The turnover-limiting step is
everything, in catalysis.

00:36:09.489 --> 00:36:11.829
And a lot of times the
turnover-ruling step is so high,

00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:13.650
they don't even know there is
catalysis.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.284
If you can break that,
you'll find a world of

00:36:16.284 --> 00:36:18.500
catalysis that didn't exist
before.

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:21.199
So that's what I think is
exciting about catalysis;

00:36:21.199 --> 00:36:22.340
it's alive.
 

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:25.498
As long as you have some energy
to dissipate you're -- it's life

00:36:25.498 --> 00:36:25.949
itself.
 

00:36:25.949 --> 00:36:31.219
Then I'll finish this quickly
off, without any details.

00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:32.670
You can see what I'm going to
do here.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:37.228
It's just that that hot oxygen
atom, that's activated to

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:38.139
transfer.
 

00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:42.239
This is the handle that would
be the allylic alcohol.

00:36:42.239 --> 00:36:46.181
And so it's a dead ringer for
the Katsuki -- for the Bert

00:36:46.181 --> 00:36:47.869
Rowland Patent,
right?

00:36:47.869 --> 00:36:49.059
That's what I think.
 

00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:52.922
And the amine,
yeah, the amine makes sense

00:36:52.922 --> 00:36:53.960
here too.
 

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.760
And I guess that's --
Prof: So did that patent

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.460
apply to this process?
 

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.170
Prof: Well Stanford made
a little --

00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:04.340
they brought over ten people,
from research,

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:07.760
and they brought over three
lawyers from AstraZeneca;

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.876
because Stanford thought maybe
they should get something out of

00:37:10.876 --> 00:37:11.230
this.
 

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:15.130
And I told the story like this,
and they didn't -- they

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.090
pretended it didn't make any
sense at all.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:19.030
You know?
 

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.659
And it was pretty unsatisfying.
 

00:37:21.659 --> 00:37:22.429
Bert Rowland was there.
 

00:37:22.429 --> 00:37:23.539
I don't know if he's still
alive.

00:37:23.539 --> 00:37:24.539
He had cancer then.
 

00:37:24.539 --> 00:37:27.349
But so we didn't -- but they'd
already made six billion

00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:29.452
dollars;
because the catalyst patent was

00:37:29.452 --> 00:37:30.679
the only extant patent.
 

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:32.900
But it did have this feature in
it.

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.003
And so they were right in the
-- I think they're right in the

00:37:37.003 --> 00:37:38.440
face of the patent.
 

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:39.650
But they didn't like that.
 

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:43.320
And we didn't -- Stanford
wasn't going to pursue it.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:48.378
Another thing we -- I'd like to
mention -- is they invited me

00:37:48.378 --> 00:37:48.969
over.
 

00:37:48.969 --> 00:37:53.829
This is before this meeting
about the patent.

00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:56.750
I guess I started to notice the
old titanium chemistry,

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:59.563
and Katsuki and I talked,
and we agreed that maybe we

00:37:59.563 --> 00:38:00.969
should raise our hand.
 

00:38:00.969 --> 00:38:03.829
But before that,
what happened was I got invited

00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:06.630
to go to a hotel in Munich,
the fanciest hotel,

00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:09.429
and they put me in this big
room upstairs.

00:38:09.429 --> 00:38:11.905
They wanted me to say something
about right- and left-handed

00:38:11.905 --> 00:38:12.409
medicines.
 

00:38:12.409 --> 00:38:16.835
And I had a little 15-minute
spot -- 1000 or 1200

00:38:16.835 --> 00:38:20.710
gastroenterologists,
from Germany alone.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:24.172
And they were doing a story
about how important drugs have

00:38:24.172 --> 00:38:25.570
to be optically pure.
 

00:38:25.570 --> 00:38:29.070
And that story doesn't wash too
well here.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.510
And I didn't realize it,
when it was going.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:34.119
But I went and I did my part.
 

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:38.327
And it is true that many drugs
are toxic in one form and good

00:38:38.327 --> 00:38:39.380
in the other.
 

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.630
And I was able to make those
points.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:47.110
But what happens here is -- oh,
and also they gave me this

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.177
suite on the top,
that had like a spiral

00:38:50.177 --> 00:38:53.480
staircase to the bed,
at the very top;

00:38:53.480 --> 00:38:55.460
and Madonna had stayed there
the week before.

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.610
&gt;
 

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.699
That's okay for her.
 

00:38:58.699 --> 00:39:00.239
She doesn't have a prostate
problem.

00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:01.320
&gt;
 

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.219
I hated that place.
 

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:04.637
I had to go -- they should've
had a fire pole so I could get

00:39:04.637 --> 00:39:05.579
down to the bathroom.
 

00:39:05.579 --> 00:39:06.409
Anyway.
 

00:39:06.409 --> 00:39:10.291
What happens is,
as Mike told you,

00:39:10.291 --> 00:39:15.469
you just look at the facts in
that system.

00:39:15.469 --> 00:39:17.865
And I noticed them just the day
I was sitting there in the

00:39:17.865 --> 00:39:19.800
audience, and the press was
interviewing us.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.170
And I whispered to the guy next
to me, and he looked at me and

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:22.559
frowned.
 

00:39:22.559 --> 00:39:24.059
It was about the weights.
 

00:39:24.059 --> 00:39:24.840
All right?
 

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:28.530
I mean, the racemate 20 mgs,
and optically pure.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.420
And I think the optically pure
is substantially more reactive,

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.409
in this case,
because it gets in better.

00:39:33.409 --> 00:39:35.309
It's, of course,
just a pro-drug,

00:39:35.309 --> 00:39:36.260
for the thing.
 

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:40.550
But the thing that was missing
from the experiments is the

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.387
forty milligrams of racemate,
which would give them

00:39:44.387 --> 00:39:47.853
equivalence against the one
enantiomer of the twenty

00:39:47.853 --> 00:39:49.349
milligrams of pure.
 

00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:52.317
And that was missing,
and they doubled the -- and it

00:39:52.317 --> 00:39:54.469
was just a sore thumb there for
me.

00:39:54.469 --> 00:39:58.210
But I didn't say anything;
nobody asked me, fortunately.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.965
Because if they had,
I would've said something about

00:40:00.965 --> 00:40:01.829
it, I imagine.
 

00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:03.271
It's the way we are.
 

00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:04.210
Right, Mike?
 

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:09.139
Mike doesn't -- he smiles,
but he gets the hard evidence.

00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:12.989
In the middle of your talk
sometimes he does this.

00:40:12.989 --> 00:40:15.460
But for me it's the best thing
you can get.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.010
Prof:
&gt;

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.099
Prof: If you can get
killed by a friend,

00:40:18.099 --> 00:40:19.507
it's the best way to get
killed.

00:40:19.507 --> 00:40:20.780
&gt;
 

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.617
Prof: Anyway,
I'm finished.

00:40:23.617 --> 00:40:24.650
That's it.
 

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:25.389
Prof: Great.
 

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:29.019
&gt;
 

00:40:29.019 --> 00:40:29.989
Prof: Great.
 

00:40:29.989 --> 00:40:30.768
Thanks again.
 

00:40:30.768 --> 00:40:34.190
Prof: Yeah,
you're welcome.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:37.181
Prof: We maybe have time
for one question or so,

00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:39.619
before we get back to our
normal business.

00:40:39.619 --> 00:40:41.670
Anybody got a question for
Professor Sharpless?

00:40:44.699 --> 00:40:45.920
No. Well thanks again.
 

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:46.239
Prof: You're welcome.
 

00:40:46.239 --> 00:40:47.760
Prof: Have a good trip
back.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:54.302
&lt;&lt;Informal discussion
between Professor McBride and

00:40:54.302 --> 00:40:57.690
Professor Sharpless&gt;&gt;
 

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:58.867
Prof: Okay thanks.
 

00:40:58.867 --> 00:40:59.244
So long.
 

00:40:59.244 --> 00:40:59.809
Good luck.
 

00:40:59.809 --> 00:41:06.485
*
Prof: Okay,

00:41:06.485 --> 00:41:08.829
back to our routine now.
 

00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:18.126
&lt;&lt;Informal discussion
between Professor McBride and

00:41:18.126 --> 00:41:22.940
Professor Sharpless&gt;&gt;
 

00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.619
Prof: Oh,
he forgot to show this picture.

00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:34.701
There he is with the royalty of
Sweden, and his wife,

00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:39.929
and the other Nobel Laureates
in Chemistry.

00:41:39.929 --> 00:41:46.739
Okay, and he was going to talk
about carvone too.

00:41:46.739 --> 00:41:47.869
He wanted you to smell it.
 

00:41:47.869 --> 00:41:49.289
I told him you'd smelled it.
 

00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:52.038
But he had an idea for a novel
based on carvone,

00:41:52.038 --> 00:41:54.260
which he didn't have time to
get to.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:42:01.539
Okay, so we were talking about
the conformation of rings.

00:42:01.539 --> 00:42:04.630
And we talked last time a lot
about cyclohexane,

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:08.664
and how it distorted --
remember, that it's not really

00:42:08.664 --> 00:42:10.978
ideal,
with the axial bonds parallel

00:42:10.978 --> 00:42:11.710
to the axis.
 

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:12.860
They spread out a little bit.
 

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.757
The ring flattens a little bit
to minimize the energy,

00:42:15.757 --> 00:42:17.889
as calculated by molecular
mechanics.

00:42:17.889 --> 00:42:20.215
Now how about in a
four-membered ring,

00:42:20.215 --> 00:42:22.289
instead of a six-membered ring?
 

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:25.195
Well if we look at the,
what molecular mechanics says

00:42:25.195 --> 00:42:27.710
about the source of strain in
this system,

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:32.219
you can see that the big
contributors are bend --

00:42:32.219 --> 00:42:37.469
that's what Baeyer had already
talked about,

00:42:37.469 --> 00:42:39.320
about the ring strain;
having 90°

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:45.014
angles is not going to be good;
so that's costing 13.5 kcal/mol

00:42:45.014 --> 00:42:47.010
-- and torsion.
 

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:50.929
Because why is there such high
torsional energy;

00:42:50.929 --> 00:42:52.340
15 kcal/mol, almost?
 

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.030
What's the source of that?
 

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:56.699
Anybody see?
 

00:42:56.699 --> 00:43:03.119
As you go around the ring,
everything is exactly eclipsed.

00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:05.260
Everybody see that?
 

00:43:05.260 --> 00:43:08.516
Every carbon-carbon bond is
eclipsed.

00:43:08.516 --> 00:43:09.239
Right?
 

00:43:09.239 --> 00:43:12.623
So that, in molecular
mechanics, sums up to almost 15

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:13.340
kcal/mol.
 

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.940
Now, if you were -- how would
you try to minimize the energy?

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.349
Is this probably the lowest
energy form, or can you think of

00:43:21.349 --> 00:43:24.190
changing it, so that it'll be
lower?

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:32.130
Any ideas? Kevin?
 

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:35.648
Student:  Make it so the
bond, in cyclobutane,

00:43:35.648 --> 00:43:38.489
aren't exactly parallel to the
new bond.

00:43:38.489 --> 00:43:40.666
Prof: Yeah,
if you make it not exactly

00:43:40.666 --> 00:43:42.722
eclipsed,
if you make it a little bit

00:43:42.722 --> 00:43:44.730
towards scatter- towards
staggered,

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:49.469
by twisting about the bonds,
that'll lower that 15 kcal/mol.

00:43:49.469 --> 00:43:55.021
But, can you see what happens,
if you begin to twist around

00:43:55.021 --> 00:43:56.170
the bonds?
 

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.719
It sharpens the angles even
more, from 90°

00:43:59.719 --> 00:44:01.768
to smaller than 90°.
 

00:44:01.768 --> 00:44:05.829
So here's what happens when you
do it.

00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:10.581
The bending energy goes up,
by 2.5 kilocalories per mole.

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:11.260
Right?
 

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:17.106
But the torsional energy goes
down, by 3.5 kilocalories per

00:44:17.106 --> 00:44:18.719
mole -- right?
 

00:44:18.719 --> 00:44:20.429
-- if you don't bend it too far.
 

00:44:20.429 --> 00:44:24.130
Okay, and the other things stay
pretty much the same.

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:28.188
So this is a competition
between torsion energy and

00:44:28.188 --> 00:44:31.742
bending energy,
and the minimum is reached with

00:44:31.742 --> 00:44:35.251
a little bit of bending,
in order to relieve some of

00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:36.159
that torsion.
 

00:44:36.159 --> 00:44:39.360
Now how about if you had a
five-membered ring?

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:44.222
Now you notice you have --
notice the bending energy isn't

00:44:44.222 --> 00:44:47.302
bad,
because as Baeyer pointed out,

00:44:47.302 --> 00:44:49.840
a pentagon,
a regular pentagon,

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:53.297
has just the right angles --
109.5° about.

00:44:53.297 --> 00:44:53.989
Right?
 

00:44:53.989 --> 00:44:55.340
So there's hardly any bending.
 

00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.043
But there's still a lot of
torsion, from the eclipsing of

00:44:58.043 --> 00:44:58.719
the carbons.
 

00:44:58.719 --> 00:45:02.594
So what you do,
if you run the molecular

00:45:02.594 --> 00:45:07.266
mechanics program,
is to cause bending energy to

00:45:07.266 --> 00:45:10.077
occur;
that is, sharpen the angles a

00:45:10.077 --> 00:45:11.268
little bit, right?
 

00:45:11.268 --> 00:45:14.659
But you get rid of a lot of
torsional energy by doing that.

00:45:14.659 --> 00:45:17.579
And this particular
conformation -- which you can

00:45:17.579 --> 00:45:20.572
see how it's bent down;
the black carbon,

00:45:20.572 --> 00:45:25.255
eight there -- is sometimes
referred to as the envelope

00:45:25.255 --> 00:45:28.030
conformation of cyclopentane.
 

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:32.510
See how it looks like the fold
of the envelope bent down?

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.438
Okay, so there again is a
competition between bending and

00:45:36.438 --> 00:45:37.139
torsion.
 

00:45:37.139 --> 00:45:41.498
Now, like plastic models,
molecular mechanics is

00:45:41.498 --> 00:45:47.065
satisfying because it says not
only what the structure should

00:45:47.065 --> 00:45:48.550
be, but why.
 

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:50.949
What is it that makes the
energy the way it is?

00:45:50.949 --> 00:45:54.387
Okay, so you remember last time
we passed around the

00:45:54.387 --> 00:45:55.400
cyclohexanes.
 

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.659
Remember how they clicked,
to go from one form to another?

00:45:58.659 --> 00:46:00.079
So what's happening?
 

00:46:00.079 --> 00:46:02.181
The question is,
what's the source of the

00:46:02.181 --> 00:46:04.230
barrier to the cyclohexane ring
flip?

00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:06.802
So here's the chair
cyclohexane, and when the ring

00:46:06.802 --> 00:46:08.764
starts to flip --
remember first you go toward a

00:46:08.764 --> 00:46:10.626
boat,
by bending one of those carbons

00:46:10.626 --> 00:46:12.079
up,
like that.

00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:15.295
Now what do you think the
source of the energy is,

00:46:15.295 --> 00:46:17.199
that makes this hard to do?
 

00:46:17.199 --> 00:46:19.664
Why do you go to a maximum
energy, as you do this,

00:46:19.664 --> 00:46:21.880
and then it clicks and it goes
down again?

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.670
Sherwin?
 

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:27.539
Student:  Torsion.
 

00:46:27.539 --> 00:46:28.630
Prof: Torsion.
 

00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:29.980
Now, that's a good point.
 

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:34.208
There are, in fact,
two bonds, two butanes,

00:46:34.208 --> 00:46:36.322
that become eclipsed.
 

00:46:36.322 --> 00:46:37.230
Right?
 

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:38.369
Both of the ones on the right.
 

00:46:38.369 --> 00:46:43.016
This one is eclipsed,
but also this one is eclipsed;

00:46:43.016 --> 00:46:44.018
those four.
 

00:46:44.018 --> 00:46:44.840
Right?
 

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:49.170
And indeed, that's worth about
7 kcal/mol of going uphill.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.159
But there's an interesting
point.

00:46:51.159 --> 00:46:52.969
You did this with the models --
right?

00:46:52.969 --> 00:46:54.010
-- and you felt it click.
 

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:58.677
How do those models,
those plastic models,

00:46:58.677 --> 00:47:01.980
know from torsional energy?
 

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:03.570
Do you see what I mean?
 

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:06.835
If you take ethane in those
models, and spin it,

00:47:06.835 --> 00:47:08.849
it spins completely freely.
 

00:47:08.849 --> 00:47:10.030
There's nothing in the model.
 

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.996
You could make it -- you could
make the thing that goes into

00:47:12.996 --> 00:47:14.389
the tube,
and the tube,

00:47:14.389 --> 00:47:17.610
a little bit triangular,
so that as you tried to twist,

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.016
it would go up in energy and
then down again.

00:47:20.016 --> 00:47:20.510
Right?
 

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:21.920
Do you see how you could do
that in a model?

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:23.099
But that's not the way those
are made.

00:47:23.099 --> 00:47:24.489
They're cylinders,
they rotate freely.

00:47:24.489 --> 00:47:27.690
So why did the model click?
 

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.699
Pardon me?
 

00:47:29.699 --> 00:47:30.309
Student:  Bending.
 

00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:31.349
Prof: Bending?
 

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:32.380
Of what?
 

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:33.210
Student:  The bonds.
 

00:47:33.210 --> 00:47:34.713
Prof: Right,
exactly.

00:47:34.713 --> 00:47:35.550
Look at this.
 

00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:37.840
Why does the plastic model
click?

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.150
Because when you're halfway
across,

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:44.034
it's becoming -- if it were
flat, if the whole ring were

00:47:44.034 --> 00:47:45.297
flat,
what would the

00:47:45.297 --> 00:47:49.440
carbon-carbon-carbon angles be,
if the ring were flat?

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:50.610
Sam?
 

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:51.500
Student:  I don't know.
 

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:58.739
Prof: In a regular
hexagon, what's the angle?

00:47:58.739 --> 00:48:00.159
Dana?
 

00:48:00.159 --> 00:48:03.367
You got to be careful holding
your hand up,

00:48:03.367 --> 00:48:06.500
even if it's just to scratch
your face.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.170
What's the angle in a regular
hexagon?

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.590
Students:  120.
 

00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.920
Prof: 120°.
 

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.130
It wants to be 109.
 

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:16.380
So it has to stretch out,
if it becomes flat.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.190
And even when it becomes only
partly flat -- right?

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.329
-- this part of it is flat;
this one's out of the plane.

00:48:22.329 --> 00:48:26.237
But that means in order to have
this one in there,

00:48:26.237 --> 00:48:28.311
this bond gets compressed.
 

00:48:28.311 --> 00:48:29.030
Right?
 

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:31.751
Because if these angles want to
be 109, instead of 120,

00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:33.768
everything -- these are going
to move;

00:48:33.768 --> 00:48:36.099
this one and this one will move
closer together.

00:48:36.099 --> 00:48:41.030
So these are -- in this form,
when it's half planar,

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:46.349
these angles are bent out,
and that angle is bent in.

00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:49.547
So it's the angle bending which
in fact does it,

00:48:49.547 --> 00:48:53.018
does stress those plastic
models, which causes it to

00:48:53.018 --> 00:48:53.699
click.
 

00:48:53.699 --> 00:48:57.351
So it's interesting to be able
to look at models,

00:48:57.351 --> 00:49:01.003
or at these calculations of
molecules as springs,

00:49:01.003 --> 00:49:03.820
and see why various things
occur.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:07.739
So are molecular mechanics
programs useful?

00:49:07.739 --> 00:49:10.250
Yes, definitely they're useful.
 

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:11.579
Are they true?
 

00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:13.800
No.
 

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.380
Okay, so we'll go on from there
next time.

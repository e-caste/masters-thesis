00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.912
Prof: So today we're
going to start talking about

00:00:05.912 --> 00:00:10.411
classical utilitarianism,
and we're going to use as our

00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:13.480
point of departure Jeremy
Bentham,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.800
who lived between 1748 and 1832
and came up with the canonical

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.320
statement of the doctrine of
utilitarianism.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.403
It's a doctrine which is still
very much alive and kicking in

00:00:30.403 --> 00:00:34.010
the contemporary West despite
all of its problems,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.180
and we'll have things to say
about why that is.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.430
But I wanted to make a couple
of prefatory remarks first about

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.980
Bentham himself.
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.190
There are some thinkers in the
Western tradition,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.158
I guess in any tradition,
who have a particular

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:58.040
characteristic that Bentham
certainly has,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.301
and I think of the folks we're
going to read Karl Marx had and

00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:03.700
Robert Nozick had.
 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.706
And the thing I'm thinking of
here is they are the kind of

00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:13.364
person who takes one idea to the
most extreme possible

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:14.769
formulation.
 

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:19.436
They ask themselves a question,
"How would the world be if

00:01:19.436 --> 00:01:23.501
this idea that I have is the
only important idea,"

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:26.890
and they take it to its logical
extreme,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.470
to an excessive kind of
formulation.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.047
And they will go places with
their idea that nobody else will

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:39.510
go, and so that makes them a
little bit crazy.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:47.001
They're monomaniacal,
obsessively consumed with their

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:48.010
idea.
 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.028
In the case of Bentham it's the
idea of utility,

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:54.560
which we're going to unpack a
little bit in a moment.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.114
But what's always interesting
about people like this is that

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:05.010
they play out an idea to its
logical extreme and that

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.469
exhibits both its strengths and
its limitation just because

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:15.460
they're willing to go when
others will not go,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.080
think the unthinkable,
think politically incorrect

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.925
things for their time in pursuit
of really pushing this idea to

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:28.000
the absolute hilt.
 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.226
And so Bentham is the kind of
thinker who I suspect,

00:02:31.226 --> 00:02:34.514
at the end of the day,
nobody will be fully convinced

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:36.348
by, but he's very useful.
 

00:02:36.348 --> 00:02:39.361
He's a very useful
diagnostician of what it is

00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:43.312
about utilitarianism that's
going to be appealing to you and

00:02:43.312 --> 00:02:47.396
where eventually you're going to
want to put some limits on it

00:02:47.396 --> 00:02:50.410
just because he goes beyond the
limits.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.366
And so you can see what happens
if you push it all the way to

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:57.460
the hilt.
 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.146
Secondly, I want to just say
that Bentham is important as a

00:03:04.146 --> 00:03:08.758
fountain of more than
utilitarianism,

00:03:08.758 --> 00:03:14.444
but also of modern conceptions
of value more generally

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:15.840
considered.
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.325
You'll see that there were
rumblings of the kinds of things

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:26.530
he had to say about value in the
seventeenth century.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.610
Hobbes, for example,
who I mentioned last time,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.303
criticized Aristotle for not
seeing that what is good for

00:03:33.303 --> 00:03:36.470
some people may not be good for
other people,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.340
and Bentham builds on that idea.
 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.827
You'll see Bentham will start
to link the good to what it is

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:49.780
that people desire.
 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.593
There were also rumblings of
Bentham's methods in

00:03:53.593 --> 00:03:58.282
particularly his aspirations to
found politics on scientific

00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:01.620
principles in the seventeenth
century.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.111
We already saw last time the
Hobbesian and Lockean

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.818
creationist theories of science,
but they were really

00:04:08.818 --> 00:04:10.598
transitional figures.
 

00:04:10.598 --> 00:04:14.729
They also gave theological
justifications for their

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.696
arguments as I explained at some
length in Locke,

00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:21.009
in the context of Locke.
 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:22.370
I didn't have time to do it
with Hobbes,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.262
but many of you will know that
if you read the second

00:04:26.262 --> 00:04:30.005
two-thirds of Hobbes'
Leviathan, it's almost

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:33.600
all about interpretation of the
scriptures,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.624
showing that his scientifically
derived principles are also

00:04:38.624 --> 00:04:41.050
consistent with the Bible.
 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.829
Bentham sheds all of this.
 

00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:48.149
For Bentham he's not interested
in appeals to tradition.

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:50.720
He's not interested in appeals
to religion.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.639
He's not interested in appeals
to natural law.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.040
He dismisses the natural law
tradition as dangerous nonsense,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.009
"nonsense on stilts."
 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:09.473
He's only interested in a
scientific set of principles for

00:05:09.473 --> 00:05:11.970
organizing politics.
 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.588
And one of the nice things
about Bentham,

00:05:14.588 --> 00:05:17.300
at least from your point of
view, is--

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.245
and we'll see that
utilitarianism values efficiency

00:05:22.245 --> 00:05:25.629
in many ways,
but one of the interesting

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.783
things or the helpful things
about Bentham is that he reduces

00:05:29.783 --> 00:05:32.899
his whole doctrine to a single
paragraph,

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.124
and he puts that paragraph
right at the front of his

00:05:36.124 --> 00:05:39.475
Introduction to The
Principles of Morals and

00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:40.740
Legislation.
 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.886
So here you have the kind of
Cliffs Notes formulation of

00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.470
Bentham's argument.
 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.091
He says that,
"Nature has placed mankind

00:05:51.091 --> 00:05:55.819
under the governance of two
sovereign masters,

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:58.129
pain and pleasure.
 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:01.273
It is for them alone to point
out what we ought to do,

00:06:01.273 --> 00:06:04.180
as well as to determine what we
shall do."

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.093
So this is going to be about
describing human behavior and

00:06:09.093 --> 00:06:12.629
about what ought to be the case,
right?

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.379
What we shall do.
 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:19.187
...[T]o point out what we ought
to do as well as to determine

00:06:19.187 --> 00:06:20.709
what we shall do.
 

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:24.250
On the one hand the standard of
right and wrong,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.564
on the other the chain of
causes and effects,

00:06:27.564 --> 00:06:30.050
are fastened to their throne.
 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.629
(That's the throne of pain and
pleasure.)

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:34.199
They govern us in all we do,
in all we say,

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.259
and in all we think:
every effort we can make to

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.449
throw off our subjection (that's
our subjection to

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:43.834
pleasure-seeking and
pain-avoiding) will serve but to

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:47.870
demonstrate and confirm it (to
confirm that subjection).

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.374
In words a man may pretend to
abjure their empire (that's the

00:06:52.374 --> 00:06:56.726
empire of pain and pleasure):
but in reality he will remain

00:06:56.726 --> 00:06:59.129
subject to it all the while.
 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:03.278
The principle of utility
recognizes this subjection,

00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:06.769
and assumes it for the
foundation of that system,

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:11.850
the object of which is to rear
the fabric of felicity by the

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.088
hands of reason and law.
 

00:07:14.088 --> 00:07:19.021
Systems which attempt to
question it deal in sounds

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:23.560
instead of sense,
in caprice instead of reason,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.209
and in darkness instead of
light.

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:31.930
That is, in a nutshell,
Bentham's theory;

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:37.569
 
 

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:41.529
very bold unequivocal statement.
 

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:45.536
He's saying if you want to
understand human beings in a

00:07:45.536 --> 00:07:50.209
causal explanatory sense all you
have to know about them is that

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:53.920
they're going to seek pleasure
and avoid pain.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:58.678
And if you want to think about
what ought to happen in the

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:03.437
design of institutions they
should be designed around that

00:08:03.437 --> 00:08:06.360
fact, to accommodate that fact.
 

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.000
And he's going to develop a
system of laws,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.069
a system of government that
takes into account and is built

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:18.829
upon this assumption about human
nature,

00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:21.771
as he would have called it;
human psychology,

00:08:21.771 --> 00:08:24.490
as we would call it today.
 

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:29.879
Now, I'm going to make five
points about Bentham's system to

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:34.629
give you some sense of the full
dimensions of it,

00:08:34.629 --> 00:08:39.303
before we start dissecting it
and subjecting it to critical

00:08:39.303 --> 00:08:40.190
scrutiny.
 

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.681
I want to make sure that we
understand exactly what his

00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:45.678
system is.
 

00:08:45.678 --> 00:08:51.726
And I want to first of all
notice that it is what I'm going

00:08:51.726 --> 00:08:57.149
to call a comprehensive and
deterministic account.

00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:02.712
I call it a comprehensive and
deterministic account in that

00:09:02.712 --> 00:09:06.548
it's an account of all human
behavior.

00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:11.937
He wants to say everything you
do is ultimately determined by

00:09:11.937 --> 00:09:15.259
pleasure-seeking and
pain-avoiding.

00:09:15.259 --> 00:09:20.309
How plausible--who thinks
that's plausible?

00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:23.809
 
 

00:09:23.809 --> 00:09:24.629
Hands up.
 

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:27.039
Plausible?
 

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:28.980
Implausible?
 

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.129
Okay, give us an example,
somebody,

00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:34.490
of something that is not
pleasure-seeking or

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:39.355
pain-avoiding,
anybody, something that is not

00:09:39.355 --> 00:09:45.129
the result of pleasure-seeking
or pain-avoiding.

00:09:45.129 --> 00:09:47.269
Well, you put your hands up.
 

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:48.559
You must have had some thoughts.
 

00:09:48.559 --> 00:09:51.139
Yeah, okay here.
 

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:54.820
Yeah, you take it.
 

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.289
Student: Running into a fire to
rescue people.

00:09:56.289 --> 00:09:57.259
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:59.370
Student:  Running into a
fire to rescue people.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.610
Prof: Running into a
fire to rescue people.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.000
Okay, you run into a fire to
rescue people.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.909
What do you think Bentham would
say about that example?

00:10:09.909 --> 00:10:12.038
Yeah, over here, sir.
 

00:10:12.038 --> 00:10:14.750
Student:  The pleasure
is actually saving the people,

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.725
so there is,
like, this benefit that you get

00:10:16.725 --> 00:10:17.918
from it, the pleasure.
 

00:10:17.918 --> 00:10:21.533
Prof: The pleasure you
get from having saved the people

00:10:21.533 --> 00:10:25.029
must outweigh the pain of the
fire or you wouldn't do it.

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:28.299
Any other example?
 

00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:30.799
Nobody's got an example?
 

00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:33.440
Nobody can think of an example?
 

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.860
No?
 

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.029
Yes? Yes, sir?
 

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:40.470
Student:  Well,
there may be some.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.865
For example,
saving one's child may be

00:10:42.865 --> 00:10:46.750
purely instinctual rather than
driven by pain or pleasure.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.455
Prof: So say sacrificing
your life to save your child,

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:49.649
let's say, to put it in an
extreme case.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:51.250
Student:  Yes.
 

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.779
Prof: What would Bentham
say about that?

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:59.279
I mean, this seems like a
genuine altruistic action.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:01.590
Somebody lays down their life
for their own child.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.690
How can that be
pleasure-seeking and

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:04.649
pain-avoiding?
 

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:06.320
What would Bentham say?
 

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.720
Yeah?
 

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.370
Student: 
&gt;

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:10.788
Prof: Wait,
we need you...

00:11:10.788 --> 00:11:12.679
Student:  I mean,
clearly the pain of,

00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:14.827
like, having lost a child,
like, outweighs whatever

00:11:14.827 --> 00:11:15.428
pleasures.
 

00:11:15.428 --> 00:11:17.832
Prof: Yeah,
I think that is what he would

00:11:17.832 --> 00:11:18.139
say.
 

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:19.590
Think of the counterfactual.
 

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.565
How could I live with myself
for the rest of my life if I

00:11:23.565 --> 00:11:24.629
didn't do it?
 

00:11:24.629 --> 00:11:26.788
The pain would be too great.
 

00:11:26.788 --> 00:11:31.120
And Bentham considers cases
like this sort of thing.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.912
Apparently altruistic acts
seems ultimately always

00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:40.019
reducible to the pleasure-pain
calculus.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:43.179
One example he considers is
people acting from religious

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:45.250
motivations and he says,
"Ha!

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.658
Just read the Bible.
 

00:11:46.658 --> 00:11:52.110
Look at the descriptions of
heaven and hell.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.442
Isn't that a made-to-order
pleasure-seeking and

00:11:55.442 --> 00:11:57.110
pain-avoidance?"
 

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.783
Hell is described as,
you know, the fires of hell,

00:12:00.783 --> 00:12:02.058
perpetual pain.
 

00:12:02.058 --> 00:12:06.562
So, the people who constructed
religious doctrines clearly had

00:12:06.562 --> 00:12:11.214
an understanding of human nature
or they wouldn't have described

00:12:11.214 --> 00:12:15.126
hell in a way that they
described it and heaven in the

00:12:15.126 --> 00:12:17.490
way that they describe it.
 

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:23.101
So, the first thing he wants to
say is that this is a completely

00:12:23.101 --> 00:12:27.200
comprehensive explanation of
human behavior.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.600
Can anybody think of any
example that couldn't be

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:36.549
re-described as fitting this
pleasure-pain calculus?

00:12:36.549 --> 00:12:37.960
Yeah?
 

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:42.509
 
 

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:45.113
Student:  I think that
if life is all about pain and

00:12:45.113 --> 00:12:47.851
pleasure we would be willing to
replace our life with one with

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:49.580
only,
I mean, one only with pleasure,

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:49.870
right?
 

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.740
But we wouldn't.
 

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.269
We value our life by ourself.
 

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:54.860
There is something
indescribable quality to it.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:59.365
I mean, life is the sum of all
experiences rather than just

00:12:59.365 --> 00:13:01.230
pain and pleasure,
so.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.595
Prof: So you think that
there is more complexity to

00:13:05.595 --> 00:13:10.344
human motivation that's just not
expressible as or reducible to

00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:12.028
pain and pleasure.
 

00:13:12.028 --> 00:13:16.164
I think that's a very
sophisticated and common

00:13:16.164 --> 00:13:19.750
critique that's been made of
Bentham.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:24.566
If you go and read,
indeed if you read the obituary

00:13:24.566 --> 00:13:29.576
of him that was written by
Coleridge, I think it was,

00:13:29.576 --> 00:13:32.370
makes exactly this point.
 

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.812
There was this sophistication
to human motivation that isn't

00:13:36.812 --> 00:13:38.620
captured in this idea.
 

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.812
I think that the truth is
Bentham would have acknowledged

00:13:42.812 --> 00:13:44.974
some of that,
but he would have said,

00:13:44.974 --> 00:13:47.364
"At the end of the day
it's not important because the

00:13:47.364 --> 00:13:49.879
pleasure-pain calculus overrides
when the chips are down.

00:13:49.879 --> 00:13:54.293
If we're going to think about
what it is that's going to

00:13:54.293 --> 00:13:57.582
motivate people,
it's pleasure-seeking and

00:13:57.582 --> 00:13:59.590
pain-avoidance."
 

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:03.888
Okay, a second thing that you
should notice about this

00:14:03.888 --> 00:14:09.080
doctrine is that I'm going to
call it a naturalistic doctrine.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.734
In some ways it's astounding
that writing almost half a

00:14:13.734 --> 00:14:18.543
century before Darwin,
Darwin was born in 1809 and

00:14:18.543 --> 00:14:22.090
lived until 1882,
so writing almost half a

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:27.667
century before Darwin,
Bentham grounds his principle

00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:32.908
in the imperatives for human
survival.

00:14:32.908 --> 00:14:36.758
He thinks that the
pleasure-pain principle has a

00:14:36.758 --> 00:14:38.970
natural biological basis.
 

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:42.633
Although there are religious,
moral and political sources and

00:14:42.633 --> 00:14:46.870
sanctions of pain and pleasure,
these are all secondary to the

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.029
physical sources for Bentham.
 

00:14:49.029 --> 00:14:51.870
"The physical,"
he refers to at one point,

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.779
as "the groundwork"
of the political,

00:14:53.779 --> 00:14:55.129
moral, and religious.
 

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:59.210
It is included in each of them.
 

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.091
At another point he says we are
bound by the principle of

00:15:03.091 --> 00:15:06.764
utility as "the natural
constitution of the human

00:15:06.764 --> 00:15:10.855
frame" often unconsciously
and often when our conscious

00:15:10.855 --> 00:15:15.221
explanations for our actions are
inconsistent with the principle

00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:16.539
of utility.
 

00:15:16.539 --> 00:15:17.759
I'll come back to that point.
 

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:21.908
If we didn't abide by the
principle of utility,

00:15:21.908 --> 00:15:25.496
he says in his little essay,
The Psychology of Economic

00:15:25.496 --> 00:15:27.851
Man,
he says, "The human

00:15:27.851 --> 00:15:31.727
species could not continue in
existence and that in a few

00:15:31.727 --> 00:15:34.011
months,
not to say weeks or days,

00:15:34.011 --> 00:15:36.629
we would be all that would be
needed for its

00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:37.970
annihilation."
 

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.488
In other words,
the principle of utility

00:15:41.488 --> 00:15:46.538
expresses our objective
interests as living creatures.

00:15:46.538 --> 00:15:52.599
A third point that I'm going to
make about Bentham's doctrine is

00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:58.370
that it's what I will call
egoistic, but not subjectivist.

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:03.275
Now, that's a lot of babble
terminology, but let me explain

00:16:03.275 --> 00:16:04.629
what it means.
 

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:08.500
The reason I'm using those two
words together is that they

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.470
don't normally go together.
 

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.865
That is to say egoistic views
are usually subjectivist,

00:16:14.865 --> 00:16:18.038
so I'm pointing out that
they're not.

00:16:18.038 --> 00:16:22.851
And by egoistic I mean it is
just like in all economics

00:16:22.851 --> 00:16:27.038
assumptions, the assumption of
self-interest.

00:16:27.038 --> 00:16:30.778
People are self-interested
seekers after pleasure,

00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:35.638
and self-interested avoiders of
pain in exactly the way you

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:39.658
learn about them in an economics
101 textbook.

00:16:39.658 --> 00:16:45.759
And we'll have occasion to
examine that self-interested

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:49.149
premise in some depth later.
 

00:16:49.149 --> 00:16:53.422
But it's not a subjectivist
doctrine in that Bentham wants

00:16:53.422 --> 00:16:57.919
to say this is true regardless
of what we ourselves say about

00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:59.418
our preferences.
 

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:07.384
It's not dependent upon your
acknowledging its truth for its

00:17:07.384 --> 00:17:09.950
being true, okay?
 

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:13.798
So you might think you're
motivated by altruism,

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:17.808
or love of your child,
or your religious faith.

00:17:17.808 --> 00:17:20.684
Bentham says,
"You're just muddled and

00:17:20.684 --> 00:17:21.369
deluded.
 

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:22.838
You don't understand.
 

00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:28.092
Your subjective understanding
is not in accord with the

00:17:28.092 --> 00:17:31.009
science of the matter."
 

00:17:31.009 --> 00:17:36.413
At one point he says,
"It is with the anatomy of

00:17:36.413 --> 00:17:42.750
the human mind as it is with the
anatomy and physiology of the

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.308
human body.
 

00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:48.761
The rare case is not of a man's
being unconversant,

00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:52.680
but of his being conversant
with it."

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:57.488
So just as if you have a pain
in your side and you don't know

00:17:57.488 --> 00:18:00.211
if it's your liver,
or your spleen,

00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:03.417
or your lung,
the rare case is you get it

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:04.380
right.
 

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.528
He once says exactly the same
with your motivation.

00:18:09.528 --> 00:18:12.704
The fact that you don't
understand, or wouldn't agree

00:18:12.704 --> 00:18:15.636
with, or don't acknowledge
what's motivating you,

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:17.470
so much the worse for you.
 

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:24.182
You just have an inaccurate or
incomplete understanding of your

00:18:24.182 --> 00:18:25.589
motivation.
 

00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:28.160
You're just wrong, okay?
 

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.736
So it's in that sense picks up
on the idea this is an

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:33.250
objectivist account.
 

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:35.650
It is objectively the case.
 

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.798
Whatever people think about it,
whatever people say about it,

00:18:38.798 --> 00:18:44.693
it is objectively the case that
they behave self interestedly in

00:18:44.693 --> 00:18:49.558
the pursuit of pleasure and the
avoidance of pain.

00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:54.269
Fourth, Bentham's is a
radically consequentialist

00:18:54.269 --> 00:18:55.348
doctrine.
 

00:18:55.348 --> 00:18:58.640
Anyone know what that might
mean?

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:07.141
Anyone want to tell us what you
think I might mean by calling it

00:19:07.141 --> 00:19:11.190
a consequentialist doctrine?
 

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:20.808
Yeah? Yes, ma'am?
 

00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:24.316
Student:  That in being
motivated by pleasure and pain

00:19:24.316 --> 00:19:27.528
we're concerned with the
consequences of our actions.

00:19:27.528 --> 00:19:30.895
If we know something is going
to be painful we'll avoid it,

00:19:30.895 --> 00:19:33.972
and if it's going to be
pleasurable we'll move towards

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:34.380
it.
 

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.843
Prof: Yeah,
but as I said at the beginning

00:19:36.843 --> 00:19:39.203
of the lecture,
Bentham takes everything to the

00:19:39.203 --> 00:19:39.818
extreme.
 

00:19:39.818 --> 00:19:44.173
So we are concerned with the
consequences of the action and

00:19:44.173 --> 00:19:45.298
nothing else.
 

00:19:45.298 --> 00:19:49.170
It's an extreme
consequentialist doctrine.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:54.848
He's not interested in our
intentions, right?

00:19:54.848 --> 00:19:58.088
The road to hell is paved with
good intentions for Bentham.

00:19:58.088 --> 00:20:02.240
Now, it doesn't matter what
people intend it matters what

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.500
happens, right?
 

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.160
It's a radically
consequentialist doctrine.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:11.599
We will see that there's an
alternative tradition of

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:16.387
thinking about ethics and
politics that is deeply rooted

00:20:16.387 --> 00:20:21.786
in human intentions when we come
to read Robert Nozick and John

00:20:21.786 --> 00:20:25.528
Rawls and people who draw on
Kant's,

00:20:25.528 --> 00:20:28.980
Immanuel Kant's ethics,
and that's what gets to you--

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:33.993
to give you all of the jargon
up front that is what will be

00:20:33.993 --> 00:20:39.082
called deontological,
sometimes contrasted with

00:20:39.082 --> 00:20:40.769
teleological.
 

00:20:40.769 --> 00:20:45.950
Consequentialist is a kind of
teleological doctrine.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.559
What does teleological
mean?

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:47.839
Anybody?
 

00:20:47.839 --> 00:20:54.240
 
 

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:58.269
Yeah, at the back.
 

00:20:58.269 --> 00:20:59.710
Teleological system?
 

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:07.558
 
 

00:21:07.558 --> 00:21:11.699
Student:  Well,
given that telos in

00:21:11.699 --> 00:21:13.509
Greek is the end...
 

00:21:13.509 --> 00:21:15.105
Prof: The end,
the purpose,

00:21:15.105 --> 00:21:16.700
the consequence,
exactly right.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.190
So consequentialist doctrines
are teleological doctrines.

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:23.068
They're all about the
consequences,

00:21:23.068 --> 00:21:25.275
the purpose,
the ends, the goals,

00:21:25.275 --> 00:21:28.035
the results,
whereas what we will talk about

00:21:28.035 --> 00:21:30.538
later when we get to
deontological systems,

00:21:30.538 --> 00:21:35.140
or the antithesis of that,
they focus on intentions,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.240
on processes,
on procedures,

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:41.650
on how you do things,
not on where you get to, okay?

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.170
So Bentham is a radical
consequentialist,

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:50.358
and you judge a doctrine simply
by looking,

00:21:50.358 --> 00:21:53.368
you judge a possible policy,
an action,

00:21:53.368 --> 00:21:57.176
anything you're thinking of
doing or not doing simply by

00:21:57.176 --> 00:22:01.470
virtue of what effect it is
likely to have and nothing else.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.779
Nothing else matters.
 

00:22:03.779 --> 00:22:07.598
 
 

00:22:07.598 --> 00:22:13.830
Finally, Bentham thinks
everything he's doing is

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.818
quantifiable.
 

00:22:15.818 --> 00:22:19.549
I gave you just a sliver to
read from his Introduction to

00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:23.343
the Principles of Morals and
Legislation just so that you

00:22:23.343 --> 00:22:27.200
could get a sense of how this
guy's mind actually worked.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:31.632
He really thought it was the
case that he could develop a

00:22:31.632 --> 00:22:35.352
kind of science of
utilitarianism where he would

00:22:35.352 --> 00:22:38.440
figure out exactly how many
utils,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.828
we might call them.
 

00:22:39.828 --> 00:22:43.390
We might call them Standard
International Utils,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.320
"SIUs,"
would attach to a pleasure or

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.000
pain any policy or action,
and that eventually you could

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.477
figure out exactly what all of
the optimal policies were for

00:22:56.477 --> 00:22:58.829
the organization of society.
 

00:22:58.829 --> 00:23:00.940
He thought about utility.
 

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.000
He thought it had really four
dimensions.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
How intense is it?
 

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.880
Duration, how long does it last?
 

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.838
Its certainty or uncertainty,
that is, probability that the

00:23:12.838 --> 00:23:14.548
result will occur.
 

00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:18.012
And what he called propinquity
or remoteness,

00:23:18.012 --> 00:23:22.578
which modern economists would
say we discount pleasure into

00:23:22.578 --> 00:23:23.759
the future.
 

00:23:23.759 --> 00:23:28.430
If you say, "I'll give you
a dollar today,

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.538
or I'll give you a dollar
tomorrow,"

00:23:30.538 --> 00:23:33.809
you'll get more utility from
the dollar that you get today,

00:23:33.809 --> 00:23:35.220
okay?
 

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.952
So he thought that these were
all quantifiable dimensions of

00:23:38.952 --> 00:23:41.993
utility,
so a little unsure about the

00:23:41.993 --> 00:23:44.882
intensity,
but he's sure that everything

00:23:44.882 --> 00:23:46.440
else can be quantified.
 

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.690
And he set about quantifying.
 

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:53.070
He set about trying to figure
out a system of legislation not

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:56.795
only for his society,
by the way, he started writing

00:23:56.795 --> 00:23:59.568
constitutions for other
countries.

00:23:59.568 --> 00:24:03.358
And when he ran off to Poland
and various places and said,

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:06.736
"Look, here's my
utilitarian constitution for

00:24:06.736 --> 00:24:09.974
your country,"
and he was very disappointed

00:24:09.974 --> 00:24:14.108
when people didn't rush off and
implement it right away.

00:24:14.108 --> 00:24:19.327
So he truly believed that you
could come up with a

00:24:19.327 --> 00:24:25.183
scientifically demonstrable
system of organizing society

00:24:25.183 --> 00:24:31.358
based on the quantifiable
character of utilitarianism.

00:24:31.358 --> 00:24:39.404
So one further feature of this
quantifiable character of

00:24:39.404 --> 00:24:46.132
utilitarianism is that he
thought we could make

00:24:46.132 --> 00:24:50.519
comparisons across people.
 

00:24:50.519 --> 00:24:53.328
We could do the math across
people.

00:24:53.328 --> 00:25:00.474
We could add up how much
utility one person gets from a

00:25:00.474 --> 00:25:05.461
possible action,
and how much utility or

00:25:05.461 --> 00:25:10.765
disutility another person gets,
and redistribute in order to do

00:25:10.765 --> 00:25:16.181
what he thought we should do,
which was to maximize the

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:22.480
greatest happiness of the
greatest number.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.984
He's a complete
consequentialist,

00:25:24.984 --> 00:25:29.761
so we would do whatever we have
to do to maximize the greatest

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:32.660
happiness of the greatest
number.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.250
So, for example,
I happen to know that Denise,

00:25:36.250 --> 00:25:40.481
who's sitting over there,
has got a great capacity for

00:25:40.481 --> 00:25:41.440
utility.
 

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.670
She's easily pleased.
 

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:48.548
If you give her a book she'll
be just delighted.

00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:52.420
But Anthony over there is a
kind of grumpy guy.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.464
If you give him a book he'd
say, "Well,

00:25:54.464 --> 00:25:56.130
why didn't you give me two
books?

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.608
One measly book."
 

00:25:58.608 --> 00:26:03.430
So, if I have a choice between
giving this book to Denise,

00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:07.346
or giving the book to Anthony,
I'm going to give the book to

00:26:07.346 --> 00:26:11.329
Denise because she's going to
get more utility than Anthony's

00:26:11.329 --> 00:26:13.920
going to get from having this
book.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.471
We don't really care who has
the utility from a social

00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:18.410
perspective.
 

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:23.355
We want to maximize the
greatest happiness of the

00:26:23.355 --> 00:26:25.828
greatest number,
okay?

00:26:25.828 --> 00:26:29.756
But then what we might discover
is that Leonid over there has an

00:26:29.756 --> 00:26:32.000
even greater capacity for
utility.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.118
He is just a utility monster.
 

00:26:35.118 --> 00:26:39.557
He's got such a capacity for
happiness that any little thing

00:26:39.557 --> 00:26:44.222
that most of us would think is
neither here nor there is really

00:26:44.222 --> 00:26:46.328
going to make him happy.
 

00:26:46.328 --> 00:26:49.314
Well, then we should give
everything to him,

00:26:49.314 --> 00:26:49.868
right?
 

00:26:49.868 --> 00:26:54.380
So it's a doctrine that's
completely uninterested in the

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:58.234
distributive side of
utilitarianism except in an

00:26:58.234 --> 00:27:02.342
instrumental way,
and we'll come back to that on

00:27:02.342 --> 00:27:03.338
next Monday.
 

00:27:03.338 --> 00:27:08.977
All you want to do is maximize
the greatest happiness of the

00:27:08.977 --> 00:27:14.710
greatest number in society,
the total amount of happiness.

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.603
Now, here's a further feature
of Bentham's doctrine and I

00:27:19.603 --> 00:27:24.584
think it follows from the
consequentialism that you should

00:27:24.584 --> 00:27:29.021
at least notice,
because I think it bears on our

00:27:29.021 --> 00:27:31.540
thinking about,
for instance,

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:33.390
the Eichmann problem.
 

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:38.345
And this is actually taken from
Robert Nozick's book,

00:27:38.345 --> 00:27:42.728
who you're going to read later
in the semester,

00:27:42.728 --> 00:27:46.348
in his critique of
utilitarianism.

00:27:46.348 --> 00:27:50.598
He says let's consider the
following thought experiment.

00:27:50.598 --> 00:27:56.473
Suppose your brain was
connected by electrodes to a

00:27:56.473 --> 00:28:03.055
computer and the computer was
programmed to make you have

00:28:03.055 --> 00:28:09.751
whatever experiences give you
pleasure and not to have any

00:28:09.751 --> 00:28:14.098
experiences that give you pain.
 

00:28:14.098 --> 00:28:17.588
So you would,
in fact, be unconscious,

00:28:17.588 --> 00:28:20.098
I think actually in Nozick's
example,

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:24.190
floating in a vat unconscious,
but you would believe you were

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.278
doing whatever it is that gives
you the greatest pleasure.

00:28:28.278 --> 00:28:31.730
And the question Nozick asked
is, "Would you want to be

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:33.660
connected to the machine?"
 

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:38.430
Who would want to be connected
to the machine?

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:40.865
Okay, we only have one,
two three, four,

00:28:40.865 --> 00:28:42.678
five, six, seven,
eight, nine,

00:28:42.678 --> 00:28:43.740
ten, fifteen.
 

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.680
I see about fifteen candidates
for Nozick's pleasure machine.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.950
Who would not want to be
connected to this machine?

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:55.289
Okay, we have probably
two-thirds of you.

00:28:55.289 --> 00:28:57.480
Who's not sure?
 

00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.538
Okay, some are not sure.
 

00:28:59.538 --> 00:29:03.400
Those who wouldn't want to be
connected, why not?

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.990
I mean, this is great, isn't it?
 

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:06.308
You don't have to work anymore.
 

00:29:06.308 --> 00:29:07.568
You don't have to do
assignments.

00:29:07.568 --> 00:29:09.368
You don't have to show up to
class.

00:29:09.368 --> 00:29:12.628
You just, you know,
for the rest of your life,

00:29:12.628 --> 00:29:16.757
maybe, you're programmed to
have the experiences that give

00:29:16.757 --> 00:29:19.220
you the most pleasure in life.
 

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:21.109
What could be better than that?
 

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:23.420
Why don't you want to do it?
 

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.759
Yeah, over here?
 

00:29:25.759 --> 00:29:30.759
 
 

00:29:30.759 --> 00:29:32.856
Student:  Well,
I think the point of life is to

00:29:32.856 --> 00:29:34.480
have like a complexity of
experiences,

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:38.865
and without experiencing pain
at some point pleasure wouldn't

00:29:38.865 --> 00:29:39.890
be as sweet.
 

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.307
Prof: Okay,
the point of life is to--hold

00:29:42.307 --> 00:29:43.130
on to the mic.
 

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.970
I just want to follow this a
little.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:49.519
The point of life is to have
some contrast effects.

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:53.130
Richard Nixon said,
"Only if you've been in

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:57.431
the deepest valley can you
appreciate the joy of being on

00:29:57.431 --> 00:30:01.808
the highest mountain,"
as he was being run out of the

00:30:01.808 --> 00:30:03.730
Whitehouse in 1974.
 

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.413
Well, you could say,
okay, well, in that case we'll

00:30:07.413 --> 00:30:11.906
program the machine accordingly
so you'll have certain painful

00:30:11.906 --> 00:30:16.769
experiences in order to maximize
the net of pleasure and pain.

00:30:16.769 --> 00:30:20.453
Every, I don't know,
every fifth minute you'll have

00:30:20.453 --> 00:30:24.801
some unpleasant experience just
so that you don't forget how

00:30:24.801 --> 00:30:27.750
pleasant the pleasant experience
is.

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.009
We can do that.
 

00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:31.808
Student:  Well,
then you wouldn't be,

00:30:31.808 --> 00:30:33.859
like, having free will in
experiencing the various

00:30:33.859 --> 00:30:34.529
experiences.
 

00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:35.809
Prof: Okay,
so that's different.

00:30:35.809 --> 00:30:36.890
It's not the contrast.
 

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.525
It's not the banality of
pleasure, if you like,

00:30:40.525 --> 00:30:44.160
it's that the lack of free will
or autonomy.

00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:48.032
But couldn't we program it to
make you think you were acting

00:30:48.032 --> 00:30:50.200
freely even though you weren't?
 

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:53.700
I think--what about that?
 

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:59.344
Some people say that's true of
us all, this idea we have free

00:30:59.344 --> 00:31:01.788
will it's a lot of bunk.
 

00:31:01.788 --> 00:31:05.728
We're all really basically just
acting out sort of impulses and

00:31:05.728 --> 00:31:08.650
instincts, but we believe we
have free will.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.404
So you could be made to believe
that you're making choices even

00:31:12.404 --> 00:31:13.980
if, in fact, you aren't.
 

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:16.151
Student:  Well,
wouldn't the,

00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:18.693
like, free will be as much a
component of,

00:31:18.693 --> 00:31:21.609
like, the natural physical
nature of man...

00:31:21.609 --> 00:31:22.288
Prof: Well now you're...
 

00:31:22.288 --> 00:31:24.722
Student:  As well as--I
mean, I'm adding more to

00:31:24.722 --> 00:31:25.490
Bentham, but...
 

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:28.170
Prof: Okay,
so that would be a different

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.548
theory than Bentham's theory,
but you can see where this is

00:31:31.548 --> 00:31:32.538
going, right?
 

00:31:32.538 --> 00:31:35.400
That I think there are some
people in the room,

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.660
if we had time to pursue this
conversation,

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:42.340
there are some people in the
room who no matter what you did

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.897
to the programming in the
experience machine they wouldn't

00:31:45.897 --> 00:31:48.654
like it,
and they wouldn't like it for

00:31:48.654 --> 00:31:50.798
two principle reasons,
I think.

00:31:50.798 --> 00:31:55.590
One has just been articulated
which is that somehow this seems

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.890
like an abdication of your own
autonomy.

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:04.152
And when we think back to the
Eichmann problem one of the

00:32:04.152 --> 00:32:10.259
things that troubled people was
his abdication of his autonomy.

00:32:10.259 --> 00:32:14.279
He's giving up his free will to
say, "Yes or no.

00:32:14.279 --> 00:32:15.720
I think this is right or wrong.
 

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.973
I'm going to do it on the basis
of my own autonomous

00:32:18.973 --> 00:32:20.058
judgment."
 

00:32:20.058 --> 00:32:24.818
The second thing I think that
people would worry about is

00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:27.369
who's operating the machine.
 

00:32:27.369 --> 00:32:30.078
Who's operating the machine?
 

00:32:30.078 --> 00:32:34.847
How do you know that once
they've got you floating in that

00:32:34.847 --> 00:32:39.450
vat what you wanted to have done
will in fact happen?

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:44.218
And so there's a basic problem
of agency and accountability

00:32:44.218 --> 00:32:46.519
that makes people nervous.
 

00:32:46.519 --> 00:32:52.820
But let's just put those things
to one side for the moment and

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:57.676
focus on the rest of the
exposition of Bentham's

00:32:57.676 --> 00:32:59.019
doctrine.
 

00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:00.839
We're going to come back to all
of these issues,

00:33:00.839 --> 00:33:01.460
I promise you.
 

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.348
I just want to get everything
out on the table.

00:33:04.348 --> 00:33:11.710
What he says is that the role
of government is,

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:16.903
"A measure of government
(which is but a particular kind

00:33:16.903 --> 00:33:19.778
of action,
performed by a particular

00:33:19.778 --> 00:33:24.115
person or persons) may be said
to be comfortable to or dictated

00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:28.243
by the principle of utility when
in like manner the tendency

00:33:28.243 --> 00:33:32.162
which it has to augment the
happiness of the community is

00:33:32.162 --> 00:33:36.220
greater than any which it has to
diminish it."

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:41.157
So again, the bumper sticker
version of that for Bentham is,

00:33:41.157 --> 00:33:45.930
maximize the greatest happiness
of the greatest number.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.750
And for those of you who like
thinking diagrammatically,

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:54.568
and as I noted in my opening
lecture not everybody does,

00:33:54.568 --> 00:33:57.480
but if we imagine a two-person
society,

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.391
so A has this much utility,
that's the status quo,

00:34:01.391 --> 00:34:02.029
right?
 

00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:03.970
A has this much utility.
 

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:08.072
B has that much utility,
and let's say there's some

00:34:08.072 --> 00:34:12.338
outer limit of possible utility,
which we'll call the

00:34:12.338 --> 00:34:14.389
possibility frontier.
 

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:19.239
Bentham would say if you draw
that line there anything that

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:22.340
puts us in this,
whatever it is,

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:27.077
cloudy zone here,
would be a net increase in the

00:34:27.077 --> 00:34:31.309
total amount of utility in the
society;

00:34:31.309 --> 00:34:34.039
pretty straight-forward claim,
right?

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:35.690
So we went from there to there.
 

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:39.409
Both would have more utility,
but if we went from there,

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.922
say, to there A's utility would
have gone up and B's would have

00:34:42.922 --> 00:34:45.197
gone down,
but we don't care,

00:34:45.197 --> 00:34:50.409
right, because the total amount
of utility in this society has

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:51.349
gone up.
 

00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:56.333
What we wouldn't want to do is
come anywhere into this area

00:34:56.333 --> 00:35:00.715
because then utility,
the total amount of utility in

00:35:00.715 --> 00:35:03.980
this society would have
decreased.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.650
 
 

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:12.059
Okay, so that's basically the
story.

00:35:12.059 --> 00:35:16.990
Now, you might say,
"Well, why do you need

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:22.030
government at all if this is the
story?"

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:27.039
Everybody is--whatever they
think, whatever they say,

00:35:27.039 --> 00:35:30.719
whatever they understand,
everybody is a mindless

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:33.480
pleasure-seeker and
pain-avoider,

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.300
or perhaps mindful
pleasure-seeker or pain-avoider,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.579
but they have no control over
that.

00:35:38.579 --> 00:35:42.449
They're going to just do what
they have to do.

00:35:42.449 --> 00:35:47.666
Why create government with the
principle that it should

00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:51.050
maximize utility in this
society?

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:53.880
It seems like an odd thing to
do.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.429
Why would you do that?
 

00:35:57.429 --> 00:36:06.289
Anyone? Yeah?
 

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:07.862
Student:  So just
looking at that last graph,

00:36:07.862 --> 00:36:08.110
right?
 

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.481
If each person tried to
maximize their utility then

00:36:11.481 --> 00:36:15.800
they'd both want to be on the
opposite corners of each other,

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.815
so then you would get chaos
when you extrapolate that to a

00:36:18.815 --> 00:36:19.610
larger group.
 

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.876
You need something to kind of
manage everybody's pleasure,

00:36:22.876 --> 00:36:23.449
I guess.
 

00:36:23.449 --> 00:36:27.264
Prof: So people wouldn't
voluntarily do things that

00:36:27.264 --> 00:36:31.079
maximize one another's--maximize
the total social utility,

00:36:31.079 --> 00:36:31.750
right?
 

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:35.677
If taking something from A and
giving it to B would increase

00:36:35.677 --> 00:36:39.340
B's utility more than it would
diminish A's utility,

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.429
well A's not going to go for
that voluntarily.

00:36:42.429 --> 00:36:46.472
B might go and take it,
but he may or may not be strong

00:36:46.472 --> 00:36:47.969
enough to take it.
 

00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:49.079
We don't know.
 

00:36:49.079 --> 00:36:53.998
So that's a very shrewd
observation in response to that

00:36:53.998 --> 00:36:56.998
diagram,
and it actually gets to more

00:36:56.998 --> 00:37:00.353
sophisticated questions about
redistribution and

00:37:00.353 --> 00:37:04.210
utilitarianism that I'm going to
take up on Monday.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:06.882
But there's,
I think, before we get to those

00:37:06.882 --> 00:37:10.896
questions,
there's a more fundamental

00:37:10.896 --> 00:37:18.295
level at which Bentham thinks
utilitarianism creates the need

00:37:18.295 --> 00:37:22.762
for government,
and that is that there's a

00:37:22.762 --> 00:37:27.333
disconnect between what's
individually optimal and what's

00:37:27.333 --> 00:37:31.905
socially optimal even before we
get to the redistributive

00:37:31.905 --> 00:37:33.130
questions.
 

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:38.170
We might call it the market
failure theory of government.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:47.164
Where other eighteenth-century
thinkers had taken the view that

00:37:47.164 --> 00:37:50.896
when this,
you know, Adam Smith's famous

00:37:50.896 --> 00:37:54.190
invisible hand,
everybody acting selfishly

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.590
leads to a collectively optimal
result.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.925
Bentham, we'll see,
thinks that's true a lot of the

00:38:00.925 --> 00:38:02.460
time, but not always.
 

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:09.197
There are certain circumstances
in which people are likely not

00:38:09.197 --> 00:38:14.500
to act in a way that produces a
common result.

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:21.045
"The great enemies of
public peace are the selfish and

00:38:21.045 --> 00:38:25.670
dissocial passions--
necessary as they are...Society

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:29.398
is held together only by the
sacrifices that men can be

00:38:29.398 --> 00:38:32.782
induced to make of the
gratifications they demand:

00:38:32.782 --> 00:38:36.719
to obtain these sacrifices is
the great difficulty,

00:38:36.719 --> 00:38:40.530
the great task of
government."

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:44.927
And he's thinking really of,
and this may be the first

00:38:44.927 --> 00:38:50.072
formulation of it that we find,
what we today call free-riding,

00:38:50.072 --> 00:38:51.400
freeloading.
 

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:58.789
He thinks about the provision
of something like national

00:38:58.789 --> 00:39:06.179
defense, what we call,
economists call a public good.

00:39:06.179 --> 00:39:11.217
You can't be excluded from the
benefits of it,

00:39:11.217 --> 00:39:15.809
right, and it must be jointly
supplied.

00:39:15.809 --> 00:39:17.318
So it says, If,
for example,

00:39:17.318 --> 00:39:20.784
the commencement or continuing
of a war being the question upon

00:39:20.784 --> 00:39:23.288
the carpet,
if, upon his calculation,

00:39:23.288 --> 00:39:26.699
a hundred a-year during the
continuance of the war,

00:39:26.699 --> 00:39:29.079
or for ever,
will be the amount of the

00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:33.065
contribution which according to
his calculation he will have to

00:39:33.065 --> 00:39:33.579
pay.
 

00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:36.309
(You have to pay a hundred
dollars a year in taxes to

00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:37.360
finance this war.)
 

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:42.059
If his expected profit by the
war will be equal to 0,

00:39:42.059 --> 00:39:45.351
and no particular gust or
passions intervene to drive him

00:39:45.351 --> 00:39:49.056
from the pursuit of what appears
to be his lasting interest upon

00:39:49.056 --> 00:39:49.880
the whole.
 

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:54.192
-- he will be against the war
and what influence it may happen

00:39:54.192 --> 00:39:57.443
to him to possess,
will be exerted on the other

00:39:57.443 --> 00:39:58.079
side.
 

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:01.590
Now, why would his benefit be
zero?

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:08.728
This is rather convoluted
prose, but what Bentham's saying

00:40:08.728 --> 00:40:11.471
is,
"If the war is going to be

00:40:11.471 --> 00:40:15.500
fought anyway,
I get no marginal benefit from

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.000
supporting it.
 

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.702
I might as well oppose it,
or I might as well refuse to

00:40:21.702 --> 00:40:25.360
pay taxes in support of
it," right?

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.750
And that is the nature of
public goods,

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:31.317
that people can free ride on
their provision because an

00:40:31.317 --> 00:40:35.347
economist says the two features
of a public good are they must

00:40:35.347 --> 00:40:39.237
be jointly supplied,
everybody has to contribute to

00:40:39.237 --> 00:40:42.047
them,
and you can't exclude anybody

00:40:42.047 --> 00:40:44.179
from the benefits of them.
 

00:40:44.179 --> 00:40:47.936
Like clean air,
if we create clean air for some

00:40:47.936 --> 00:40:52.264
people we're going to create
clean air for all people,

00:40:52.264 --> 00:40:53.000
okay?
 

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.791
So people are going to have to
be coerced in the provision of

00:40:55.791 --> 00:40:56.489
public goods.
 

00:40:56.489 --> 00:41:00.679
People are going to have to be
coerced to pay for the war.

00:41:00.679 --> 00:41:03.559
So that's one example.
 

00:41:03.559 --> 00:41:07.987
Another one that comes up is
the so-called tragedy of the

00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:09.409
commons problem.
 

00:41:09.409 --> 00:41:13.016
Suppose you have some common
land, and we'll come back to

00:41:13.016 --> 00:41:16.880
talking about this in connection
with Locke's social contract

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.590
theory.
 

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:21.608
God gave the world to mankind
in common, on Locke's story,

00:41:21.608 --> 00:41:26.050
so long as much and as good is
available to others in common.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:29.739
So if you have common land
here's the problem.

00:41:29.739 --> 00:41:33.500
You're thinking about grazing
your sheep on the common.

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:39.304
If I put my sheep onto that
common land it doesn't do any

00:41:39.304 --> 00:41:43.063
lasting damage,
but if everybody grazes their

00:41:43.063 --> 00:41:46.980
sheep on the land and none of it
is allowed to lie fallow,

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:50.210
then it destroys the common,
okay?

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:54.123
So there are too many sheep for
everybody to gaze their sheep on

00:41:54.123 --> 00:41:57.851
the land, but any individual
person doesn't have a reason not

00:41:57.851 --> 00:41:59.280
to graze his sheep.
 

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:03.931
This was finally formulated in
a rigorous way by a man called

00:42:03.931 --> 00:42:05.250
Garrett Hardin.
 

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:09.074
The tragedy of the commons that
if you have commons they'll be

00:42:09.074 --> 00:42:12.646
destroyed because each person
will do something that makes

00:42:12.646 --> 00:42:16.659
individual rational sense but
not collective rational sense.

00:42:16.659 --> 00:42:20.733
So this is, again,
it's not exactly the same as

00:42:20.733 --> 00:42:24.893
the free-riding problem,
but it's related to the

00:42:24.893 --> 00:42:27.018
free-riding problem.
 

00:42:27.018 --> 00:42:31.121
I won't see any reason in the
world why I shouldn't graze my

00:42:31.121 --> 00:42:35.360
cow or my sheep on the common,
but when everybody does that we

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.960
destroy the common.
 

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.472
It's a bit like walking down
the street with a soda can and

00:42:40.472 --> 00:42:42.981
you think,
"Should I take the trouble

00:42:42.981 --> 00:42:46.536
to cross the street to put it in
a recycling bin or just throw it

00:42:46.536 --> 00:42:47.760
in the trash?"
 

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.583
One Coke bottle,
I mean, what difference one

00:42:50.583 --> 00:42:54.523
Coke bottle--it's not going to
make--but if everybody doesn't

00:42:54.523 --> 00:42:56.757
cross the street,
the same problem,

00:42:56.757 --> 00:42:57.480
okay?
 

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:01.349
So these are the areas where
there's a disconnect.

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:06.251
There's a disconnect between
individual utility and social

00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:11.409
utility, and that is what
creates the need for government.

00:43:11.409 --> 00:43:16.639
We will pursue these questions
and much else about classical

00:43:16.639 --> 00:43:19.210
utilitarianism next Monday.
 

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:25.000

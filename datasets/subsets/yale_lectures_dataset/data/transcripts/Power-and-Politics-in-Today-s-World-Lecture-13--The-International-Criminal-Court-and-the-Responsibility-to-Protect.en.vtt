00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.550
- We're gonna continue with
the part two of the course

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.020
on the new or emerging global order

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.810
after the end of the Cold War.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.850
We've spent two lectures on democracy,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.067
and particularly the enormous promise

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
that democracy seemed to offer,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.613
which was sort of,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.500
for which the South African transition

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.500
was something of a poster child in 1994.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.620
This was before the mixed legacy

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.780
of the South African transition,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.410
and particularly the failure to achieve

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.590
much full transformation in the economy

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.670
that would play itself out in later years.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.670
In 1994, it was really
seen as the poster child

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.650
for this democracy that
was sweeping the world,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.620
including in places where
it had not been anticipated.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.670
Today, we're gonna be talking about

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.720
the International Criminal Court

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.040
and the Responsibility to Protect,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.750
two doctrines that began
a fundamental reshaping

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.470
of the international legal
and political orders.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.490
So that's going to really consume us

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.113
for the next several weeks,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.313
next several lectures, I should say.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.640
Anyone know what this is a picture of?

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.630
Who are these people?

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.023
- [Man] Rwanda.

00:01:54.023 --> 00:01:56.173
- It's Rwanda, yeah, who are these people?

00:01:57.458 --> 00:01:58.350
- [Man] Tutsi, Hutu?

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.290
- Hutu.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.314
What are they doing?

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:02.714
- [Man] Committing genocide.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.312
- How do you know?

00:02:05.312 --> 00:02:07.307
What are they doing?

00:02:07.307 --> 00:02:09.320
- [Man] There are people with sticks.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.550
- They're going along with sticks.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.800
And who are these people?

00:02:13.535 --> 00:02:16.010
- [Man] Peacekeepers.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.510
- [Ian] Yeah, these are UN peacekeepers.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.325
What are they doing?

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:21.740
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.573
(audience laughs)

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.700
They're watching.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.000
This is a famous photograph
that appeared in The Guardian

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.513
on the 12th of April, 1994,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.790
and did the 1994
equivalent of going viral.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.940
Of course the rules of engagement
for UN peacekeeping troops

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.020
was that they could not become involved

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.760
in ongoing conflicts,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.760
and so, in effect, they
were not in a position

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.120
to do anything about it.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.053
And so this is,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.987
you could call a subtitle
for today's lecture,

00:03:03.987 --> 00:03:05.410
"Rwanda's Shadow,"

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.210
because this was a horrific genocide

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.210
in the course of which,
in about three months,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.130
somewhere between 800,000
and a million Tutsi,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.980
mostly Tutsi, some moderate
Hutu, and some other groups,

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.120
were slaughtered in the most

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.873
graphic, much of it appeared
in the Western media.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.730
You could go up and if you
tried to look on YouTube

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.610
you'll have to sign in confirming your age

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.563
because a lot of it is so gruesome.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.370
So the thought was that

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.920
the international community
had to be able to respond.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.490
After World War II we heard these praises

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.250
like "Never again."

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.970
This was a clear case of genocide

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.650
and if the international community

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.903
couldn't do things to stop it,

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.180
it was likely to proliferate,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.540
genocides were likely to proliferate.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.480
This what I had taught you earlier

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.410
about the sort of frozen-in-place
international structure.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.380
The Cold War was gone and it was not clear

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.380
that the major powers would
police their surrogates

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.040
in ways that would prevent
this kind of violence.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.940
It's really quite a dramatic counterpart

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.640
when you think that the very same month,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.650
2,300 miles to the south,

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.160
the South Africans were having

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.160
their first democratic election,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.670
three days of peaceful voting,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.530
again, all this euphoria,

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.530
while at the same time this
carnage was going on in Rwanda.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.930
Let's listen to President
Clinton on this 22nd of July

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.853
just after it was more or less over.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.183
- Good morning.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.473
I have just met with my
national security team.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.270
The flow of refugees
across Rwanda's borders

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.980
has now created what could be

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.053
the world's worst humanitarian
crisis in a generation.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.640
It is a disaster born of brutal violence,

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.220
and according to experts now on site,

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.023
it is now claiming one life every minute.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.970
Today I am announcing an immediate

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.123
and massive increase in our response.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.930
We will provide personnel and equipment

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.410
to enable these airfields to
operate on a 24-hour basis.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.680
Our aims is to move food,
medicine, and other supplies

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.000
to those in need as quickly as possible.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.850
I've directed the Pentagon to
establish a safe water supply

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.350
and to distribute as
much water as possible

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.260
to those at risk.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.440
Safe water is essential to
stop the outbreak of cholera

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.070
and other diseases that
threaten the refugees.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.440
I've ordered the State Department

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.820
and our ambassador to the United Nations,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.640
who is here with us today,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.720
to take immediate action to
help create those conditions.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.210
The United States will support and urge

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.860
the immediate deployment
of a full contingent

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.320
of United Nations peacekeepers to Rwanda,

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.940
to provide security for
the return of the refugees.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.560
We are making clear to
the new leaders of Rwanda

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.320
that international acceptance,

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.930
including American recognition,

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.110
depends upon the establishment
of a broad-based government,

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.100
the rule of law, and efforts
at national reconciliation.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.360
We're taking action to
counteract the propaganda

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.300
of the extremist Hutu elements,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.860
who continue to urge Rwandans to flee.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.630
Taken together, these steps will help

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.490
to relieve the suffering
of the Rwandan refugees

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.783
and create conditions
for their return home.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:10.470
- So, President Clinton
was heavily criticized

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.560
after that speech,

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.640
and the reason he was heavily criticized

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.430
was not for what he said
but for what he didn't say

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.020
and, indeed, for what the administration

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.710
had systematically been refusing to say

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.620
throughout the build up
and then the unfolding

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.500
of the Rwandan crisis.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.860
That was the word genocide.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.470
It refused to say genocide.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.470
And you can now find in
the archival documents

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.923
there was a lot of back and
forth within the administration,

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.450
huge resistance to
using the word genocide,

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.323
on the grounds that that would dictate

00:07:48.323 --> 00:07:50.423
that we would have to go and do something.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:56.310
And President Clinton
was extremely reluctant

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.110
to do anything to get American troops

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:01.220
involved in this conflict

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.490
because he had had his nose badly bloodied

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.500
six months earlier in Somalia

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.000
in the so-called Battle of Mogadishu.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.160
And so the US was, this had started

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.300
under the Bush Senior administration,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.210
the US had been the leading player

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.930
in the UN's peacekeeping
operation in Somalia,

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.190
called the UN Operation in Somalia.

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.260
And it was an ongoing civil war.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.820
And as part of that effort

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.820
in what was widely seen as
badly-botched American operation,

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.710
two Black Hawk helicopters
had been shot down

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.560
and the so-called Battle
of Mogadishu proceeded,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.560
in which 18 Americans were
eventually killed and 73 wounded.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.200
And from the point of view
of the administration,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.510
what was especially damaging
was three dead Americans

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:11.050
were dragged, dead or dying Americans,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.190
were dragged through
the streets of Mogadishu

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.740
and filmed being so dragged.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:21.740
And this was, again, a 1990s
version of going viral.

00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:30.280
It was seen as a huge incompetence

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.200
on the part of the
American administration.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.437
Probably the most damaging
thing for Clinton,

00:09:38.437 --> 00:09:42.680
at least the most damaging
thing for an American president,

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.200
at least since Jimmy
Carter's botched operation

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.760
to free the hostages in Tehran in 1979,

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.810
where we also had helicopters
coming down in the desert.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:58.950
That in fact, the 18 Americans killed

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.610
in the Battle of Mogadishu

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.030
was the largest number of US fatalities

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.990
since the Vietnam War.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.470
So it was seen as a really big deal,

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.400
that would eventually be surpassed

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.020
in the Second Battle of Fallujah

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.240
that I talked to you about some time ago,

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.470
where some multiple of that was killed.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.900
I think about 95 American soldiers

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.330
were killed in that battle.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:28.220
But at the time this was
seen as a horrific mess

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.810
that the US had gotten into,

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.140
and the Clinton
administration had responded

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.210
by deciding to get out
of Somalia, rapidly.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.360
And so they pushed the UN essentially

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.170
to declare the end of
the Somalia Operation

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:46.950
the following year,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.130
and they were in the midst
of withdrawing from that.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.670
So the last thing the Clinton
administration wanted to do

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:58.790
was get American troops
involved in another civil war

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.620
where they could have taken

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.340
a massive domestic political hit.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:09.020
And so it's not surprising,
even if it's not impressive,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.580
that President Clinton refused

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.140
and the administration refused to call

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:17.340
what was going on in Rwanda genocide

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.520
and refused to get involved
until the conflict was,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:25.033
for all practical purposes, over.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:29.523
So, today's agenda is we're
gonna look at nonintervention,

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.810
this idea that has to be broached

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.600
if we're gonna start talking about

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.500
protection of international human rights

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.230
in a post Cold War world.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.010
We'll dig into what the ICC

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.630
and the doctrine of
Responsibility to Protect are,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.610
how they came to be adopted,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.070
and what force they have in the world.

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.170
We'll also question how
radical a reshaping this is

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.530
of the international
political and legal order.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.618
And they're both very much doctrines

00:12:03.618 --> 00:12:05.960
in evolution and in flux,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.070
so to some extent we're
looking at moving targets.

00:12:09.916 --> 00:12:13.500
But we will do the best that we can.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.140
And as we go through it,

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:20.140
I want us to pay particular
attention to our three I words,

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.760
to the role ideas and ideals,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.000
on the one hand, of institutions.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.213
We're talking about changing institutions.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.640
Secondly and thirdly,
the role of interests

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:38.230
and how they play out as
these ideas and institutions

00:12:39.304 --> 00:12:42.723
come under pressure to be reshaped.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.500
And the place you have to
start if you're thinking about

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.170
the international
protection of human rights

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:53.370
is the strong presumption
against intervention

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.903
in another country by external players.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.470
This hasn't always been that.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:04.920
In fact, if you read my colleague

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:09.610
Oona Hathaway and Scott
Shapiro's book in the Law School,

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.120
they will tell you, and
they are right about this,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.080
that the idea that

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.560
national sovereignty is
completely invaluable

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.540
doesn't become fully
entrenched in international law

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.170
until the UN Charter is
adopted after World War II.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.880
And the UN Charter was
centrally about preventing

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:39.070
the invasion of one country by another

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.070
and preserving in that sense
the nation state status quo

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.053
in the world after World War II.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.360
And so the idea, the norm,
that no nation can intervene

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.530
in the activities of any other nation

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.330
becomes enshrined in the UN Charter

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.410
and almost as it's part
of its raison d'etre.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:09.280
Because what we need to remember
when we talk about the UN,

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.180
talked about this briefly at
the beginning of the course,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:16.330
but the purpose of the UN was
not to be a world government.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.700
The purpose of the UN, first and foremost,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.140
was to prevent another war
between the major powers.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.570
This is why it was
structured in the way it was

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.853
and this is why the Security Council,

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.700
which is the closest thing to
the executive body of the UN,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.110
is structured the way it was,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.110
with the five victorious dominant powers

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:45.370
at the end of World War II having a veto

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.250
over anything that the
Security Council did,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.260
and the notion was that it
would be better to force them

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.030
to cooperate by having to agree

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.860
before any international
action could be taken.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.200
And when international action was taken,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.890
the default presumption
was, the term of art was

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.580
to restore international
peace and security.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:14.110
And the idea of restoring
international peace and security

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.250
was to stop wars, to stop invasions,

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:22.250
to stop anybody from trying
grab real estate in the world.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:28.920
Of course, it came to
take on many other roles,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.960
but that was the initial
purpose of the UN,

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.297
it's why it was structured the way it was,

00:15:34.297 --> 00:15:37.290
and we should also remember
that it was basically

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.810
a creature of a treaty,
a multilateral treaty.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:42.910
In this sense, its basic structure

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.623
is like the basic structure of the EU.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.070
Even though we saw with the EU

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.250
there were efforts around
the time of Maastricht

00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.400
to make the European Union,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.140
the Parliament elected by the
citizens of Europe, sovereign.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.180
That didn't work,

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.583
and by the time we got
to the Lisbon Treaty,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.710
the Lisbon route, there
was basically modification

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.050
of this treaty-based structure.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.200
So the UN is based on a treaty,

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:15.410
and that of course means,
if you wanna change it,

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.290
you'd have to negotiate a new treaty,

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:18.923
at least in principle.

00:16:20.685 --> 00:16:22.500
And the treaty created the structure

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.330
whose initial raison
d'etre was to prevent war

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.600
and certainly to prevent war
between the major powers.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.690
So, a big part of the question,

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.740
given that the UN is the sort of

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.280
presumptive international institution

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.570
in the world today, is,

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:45.140
can the structure of the UN be changed?

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.050
And if so, how?

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.550
And what's interesting about the ICC,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.600
and particularly with the doctrine

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.790
of Responsibility to Protect,

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.600
is we might characterize them
as sort of common law efforts,

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.010
or quasi common law efforts to change

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.270
the basic structure of the UN,

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.860
to make it operate as more

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.883
of an authorizer for intervention,

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.270
much more radical intervention
in the case of R2P

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.430
than in the ICC.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.610
But nonetheless, to make it possible

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.970
for this idea that nobody intervenes

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.380
in the activities of any country,

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.653
to start to be questioned.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.700
So, let's talk about the ICC first.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.930
If you think about the idea
of holding war criminals

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.700
to account for their crimes,

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.990
previously, there had been talk

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.160
going back all the way to 1919

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.790
of the idea that there should be

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.450
some kind of international criminal court.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.663
It came up again at the
end of World War II.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.490
But if you look at what was actually done,

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.280
we had previous tribunals
were all ad hoc tribunals.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.780
So we had the International
Military Tribunal,

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.210
commonly known as the Nuremberg Trials

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.010
after World War II.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.810
The International Military
Tribunal for the Far East,

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.210
less well known, but the Tokyo Trials

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.690
for Japanese war criminals.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.960
We had the Eichmann Trial
in 1961, I believe it was,

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.250
in Jerusalem, where Israel
captured Adolf Eichmann

00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:33.120
in Argentine and brought him
and tried him and executed him

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:35.010
in Jerusalem.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.130
And then we had in 1993

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.170
the International Criminal Tribunal

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.270
for the Former Yugoslavia.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.520
Again, an ad hoc, this time created

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.573
by the UN for the first time,

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.890
tribunal to try war criminals
from the Yugoslav conflict.

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.750
And the the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.980
that was created after
the Rwandan genocide

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.800
to try criminals for the Rwandan

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.760
during the Rwandan genocide.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.390
So they were ad hoc, the
last two, you see UN action.

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.160
Before that it's
essentially victor's justice

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.230
that was often criticized as being,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.470
and certainly by people
on the other end of it,

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.440
when the winning powers in conflicts

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.440
held trials of people
from the defeated side.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.130
So there was no international body

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:36.283
that could engage in
these kinds of trials.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.460
The International Criminal Court

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.310
was initiated by the Rome Treaty,

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:47.650
which was signed by 120
countries in July of 1998

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.960
and finally ratified
by 60 of them in 2002.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.560
And it has a strange
relationship toward the UN.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.800
Because the structure of the UN was such,

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.180
as I said to you, they
couldn't create a court

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:12.180
without going back to the
signatories of the treaty.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:17.210
But they had a strong
interest, they thought,

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.170
or many people at the
UN had a strong interest

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.800
in trying to create some sort of

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.220
permanent international legal tribunal.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.593
And so they commissioned
a group of lawyers,

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.790
called the International Legal Council,

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.340
International Legal Committee,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.570
I can't remember the exact title,

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.490
but these are experts in international law

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.630
appointed by the UN General Assembly.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.150
And they asked them to draft a statute

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:49.070
that could become the basis

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:51.890
for an international criminal court,

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:55.063
and they did indeed do that.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:00.990
The UN General Assembly
sponsored multiple debates

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.150
of this statute and
eventually a conference,

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.070
which led to the Rome Treaty.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.050
And the UN General Assembly
was by no means alone.

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.740
A variety of NGOs were
involved in this as well,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.470
NGOs pushing for the creation of norms

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.720
that would change international law

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.720
so that perpetrators of war
crimes could be held to account.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.523
It came into operation in July of 2002,

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.910
when 60 states had signed it.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:40.910
And today there are 129
states are now signatories

00:21:44.615 --> 00:21:48.440
of the multilateral treaty
that creates the ICC.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.050
So it's independent of
the UN, technically,

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:55.415
and it's a separate treaty

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:58.430
that is the foundation document,

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.963
the statute that creates this institution.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.020
It can prosecute, originally
it was war crimes,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.340
crimes against humanity and genocide,

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.660
and crime of aggression was added in 2010.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.360
It has pretty broad jurisdiction

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.320
in that it can prosecute crimes

00:22:25.622 --> 00:22:28.650
that occur in any of
the signatory countries

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.760
or crimes that are perpetrated

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.760
by citizens of any of
the signatory countries.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:42.510
Generally speaking, crimes
are referred for prosecution

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.490
by the countries themselves,

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.060
perhaps after a transition, for example,

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.893
when there's

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.410
limited ability of the
existing legal order

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.600
to go after people,

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.083
perhaps 'cause they are not there anymore,

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.670
or perhaps 'cause the
country is in a civil war,

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.280
it doesn't have developed
judicial capacities.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:07.840
This is not the only way

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.820
that they get crimes referred to them,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.820
but it has 18 judges who are elected

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:18.970
by something called the
Assembly of State Parties,

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:23.610
which are the signatories to the treaty.

00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:25.810
And they'll sit in three
different chambers,

00:23:26.864 --> 00:23:27.990
groups of three judges,

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.870
one does pre-trial hearings,
one does the trials,

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.953
and one does the appellate work.

00:23:36.205 --> 00:23:40.350
I'd say it's a parallel but
sort of independent institution

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:45.350
in that actually the UN Security Council

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:50.060
has begun to refer cases to the ICC.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.950
This happened after Darfur

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:57.950
when the Security Council
referred some cases they had.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.450
And once a case is referred,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:02.540
there's a prosecutor for the ICC

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.970
who does a preliminary investigation

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:08.080
to see whether charges should be brought.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:13.080
And then in 2011, in the Darfur referral,

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:19.500
the US and China abstained,

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.160
and this was partly
because the US and China

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:28.160
are not signatories to the ICC,

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.730
for reasons I'll get to in a minute.

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.170
But in 2011 the Security Council

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:38.170
unanimously referred Gaddafi
for prosecution by the ICC.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.147
And as Mark Mazower comments

00:24:44.147 --> 00:24:46.910
in the chapter that I
had you read for today,

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:50.350
this is part of what has
provoked a lot of commentary

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.940
about the hypocritical
attitude of the US toward the

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:02.420
ICC because on the one hand
we have not signed the treaty

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:07.420
and we refuse to be subject
to its jurisdiction,

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:10.306
and indeed, in peacekeeping operations,

00:25:10.306 --> 00:25:15.040
if the Security Council authorizes
peacekeeping operations,

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.310
the Americans require that their soldiers

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:21.940
cannot be subject to the
jurisdiction of the ICC

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.010
as conditions for participating
in peacekeeping operations.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:31.010
So it's not a legal system
to which the US will submit.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.990
On the other hand, here
they're participating

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:38.610
in referring others to
the Security Council,

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:43.610
most dramatically Gaddafi in 2011.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:50.100
So, how important is this institution?

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:55.250
As of 2019, it had handed
down 44 indictments,

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:03.471
it had issued 36 arrest warrants,

00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:05.971
it had 23 ongoing proceedings,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.690
there were 15 fugitives at large

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.400
who had had arrest warrants out for them,

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.940
21 proceedings had been completed.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.560
So this is from 2002 to 2019,

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:26.670
so in 17 years six people
have been convicted,

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.500
four had served prison
terms and been released,

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.810
two were still serving them.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.960
The rest had been acquitted,
charges had been dismissed,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.910
charges had been withdrawn
or otherwise fallen apart,

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.310
and four people had died before trial.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.853
So, tiny numbers, tiny
numbers you might say.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:55.690
How should we then think
about it and its legitimacy?

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:58.130
Well...

00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:05.780
One thing to say about it is
that it's long been criticized,

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.240
particularly in the Global South,

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.210
as heavily biased against
African countries.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.830
All the convictions to date

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.600
have been of people in African countries,

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.143
and virtually all the prosecutions.

00:27:21.572 --> 00:27:23.417
Not every Wikipedia page is good

00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:25.150
but there's a very good Wikipedia page

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.200
that gives a running account

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.730
of all the prosecutions currently ongoing,

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.850
and it stays up to date.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.850
And the sense that it
was anti-African became

00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:43.490
a source of a lot of criticism of it,

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.380
and indeed, even today,

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.190
although prosecutions have been opened,

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.770
one in Myanmar and one in Georgia,

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:56.770
but the vast majority of
them are African countries.

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:02.300
And in 2016, Burundi, South
Africa, and Gambia all said

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.253
that they were going to leave.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:09.050
There was then an election in Gambia

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:10.890
that reversed that decision

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.350
after a new government came to power.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.830
In South Africa, interestingly enough,

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.220
it was the Zuma government
that said they were leaving,

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.010
but the South African Constitutional Court

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.640
ruled that it would be
illegal for South Africa,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.540
it'd be unconstitutional
for South Africa to leave,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.693
so they rescinded their decision to leave.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:39.640
But the Philippines, after
Duterte's anti-drug efforts,

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:47.570
where he keep a very violent
anti-drug campaign there,

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.710
were referrals to the ICC

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.930
for prosecutions in the Philippines,

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.350
the government announced
that they were leaving,

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.970
and they left, it takes a year to leave,

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.980
and incidentally does
not immunize a country

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:07.850
from prosection during the period

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.280
when they were members of the ICC.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.393
So it doesn't mean that, in principle,

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:16.430
the crimes committed in the Philippines

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.943
couldn't still be adjudicated.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:25.100
Israel, Sudan, the US, and Russia

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:28.710
have all withdrawn their
signatures from the treaty.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:32.380
And the US role over time
bears some attention,

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.070
given that we're now in a unipolar world

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.550
and the American role is so important.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:42.720
So, the last possible day
you could sign the treaty

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.190
creating the ICC was the
last day of the century

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.940
and the last day of the Clinton,

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.100
not quite the last day of
the Clinton administration,

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.940
it ended the following January.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.150
And the Clinton administration signed it

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.550
but you can see from what
President Clinton said,

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.457
he said, "We reaffirm our strong support

00:30:02.457 --> 00:30:03.957
"for international accountability

00:30:03.957 --> 00:30:07.187
"and for bringing to justice
perpetrators of genocide,

00:30:07.187 --> 00:30:10.127
"war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

00:30:10.127 --> 00:30:14.607
"We do so as well because
we wish to remain engaged

00:30:14.607 --> 00:30:17.617
"in making the ICC an
instrument of impartial

00:30:17.617 --> 00:30:22.075
"and effective justice in years to come."

00:30:22.075 --> 00:30:25.250
So they were signaling they didn't like it

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.430
but they were gonna remain engaged

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:29.870
and essentially punt this question

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.630
to the next administration.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:32.770
They're gonna punt the question

00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:35.480
to the incoming Bush administration,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.560
but they didn't wanna
forestall the possibility

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.053
of the US being involved.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.270
The Bush administration came into office,

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.893
as we all now know.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:53.370
A year shortly after we had 9/11.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.950
The Bush administration before that

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.670
had taken no action to move forward

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.927
with American involvement in the ICC.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.040
After 9/11, in 2002,

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:15.893
the Bush administration
withdrew America's signature,

00:31:17.421 --> 00:31:21.690
so that was the end of that as
far as the ICC was concerned.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:26.690
When the Obama administration
came in in 2009,

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:30.510
they took a somewhat softer
attitude toward the ICC

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.420
and began to engage with
it and cooperate with it

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.500
in various investigations

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:40.040
and have observer status
at meetings about it

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.550
and of some of its organ bodies.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:47.080
But even the Obama
administration showed no interest

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.690
in actually having the US signed,

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.960
partly for the same reason
that I'd already mentioned,

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:58.820
which was the idea that the US involvement

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.750
in peacekeeping operations
would lead Americans

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.690
to be vulnerable to prosection

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:08.340
was not something that
the administration thought

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.920
it could sell to American voters.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.160
Of course, since then we've
had the Trump administration,

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:17.290
and as you might surmise,

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.410
that hasn't produced any change either.

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:24.250
- The United States will provide
no support in recognition

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.443
to the International Criminal Court.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:32.510
As far as America is concerned,
the ICC has no jurisdiction,

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:35.423
no legitimacy, and no authority.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.470
The ICC claims near-universal jurisdiction

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.863
over the citizens of every country,

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:46.340
violating all principles of justice,

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.183
fairness, and due process.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.660
We will never surrender
America's sovereignty

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.743
to an unelected, unaccountable,
global bureaucracy.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.910
- So, there you have an
unsurprising summation

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:06.600
of the American attitude and reaffirmation

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.550
of the idea that international law

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:14.550
applied to American citizens
is not gonna be acceptable.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.820
So, how should we think about

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.793
whether the ICC is a good or bad thing?

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.370
Any, any...

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.090
Any thoughts about that?

00:33:28.090 --> 00:33:29.690
Anyone thinks it's a good thing?

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.703
Good thing, somebody who
thinks it's a good thing, yeah.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:40.710
- [Man] A metric could
be the number of people

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:45.710
who are killed in interstate conflict.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.670
- So you say it would be
whether it's a deterrent or not.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.000
- Yes.
- Okay, one metric,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.690
would it be a deterrent, yeah.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.970
And what else, anyone else?

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.980
So you're just saying that's the metric,

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.320
you're not sure whether
it's a good or bad thing.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.833
You think it's a good thing?

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:04.150
Somebody who thinks it's a good thing,

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:05.200
why is it a good thing?

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:06.630
Yes, sir?

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.850
- [Man] I think it
provides an infrastructure

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.990
for countries who have gone through

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:15.880
particular bad situations,
war crimes, genocides,

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.120
to have access to an institution

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.360
that is judicial in its form

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.233
when otherwise it wouldn't have it.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:29.480
- Any other thoughts?

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.280
Anyone else think it's a good thing?

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:33.703
Yes, sir?

00:34:37.810 --> 00:34:39.393
I see one hand here.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:45.740
- [Man] Thank you.

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:49.710
So, I think it's not effective in fact,

00:34:49.710 --> 00:34:53.970
but it's a good symbol in the world.

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:55.470
- It's a good symbol.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.170
A symbol of what exactly?

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:02.170
- [Man] To show the
accountability of those--

00:35:04.982 --> 00:35:07.780
- That people can be held
accountable for what they do,

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:12.150
that dictators or people
engaged in wars can,

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:15.130
there's some chance you
might be held accountable.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.240
It stands for that idea.

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.973
So okay, anyone think it's a bad thing?

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.563
The truth is it's tricky to evaluate.

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:34.440
So, the small scale might
not matter that much

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.630
because the question is
not whether it's small

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:41.070
but perhaps whether it's scalable.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:45.060
And there's a literature
in political science

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:50.060
for which Martha Finnemore
and Kathryn Sikkink are famous

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.580
where they talk about norm cascades.

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:56.820
And the idea is that once a
norm starts to get established,

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.020
provided a critical number,

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.656
and scholars argue about
how many, endorse the norm,

00:36:02.656 --> 00:36:05.380
others join up as well.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.610
And interestingly on that front,

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:14.300
in 2016, when South Africa
and Gambia and these others

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.640
were threatening to storm out,

00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:19.840
there were a lot of predictions

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.080
that it was all gonna fall apart

00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.060
and that there was gonna be
a massive African exodus.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.810
That didn't happen.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.533
So to the extent that,

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.020
they also talk about norm entrepreneurs,

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.600
people who are trying to,

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.800
this is the realm of ideas
now of our three I words,

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:44.110
that norm entrepreneurs are
trying to get enough countries

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:46.540
to start investing in a process

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:49.050
that do then reach this tipping point

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.660
where it will start to become embedded,

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:55.420
it might become scalable, and so on.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:37:00.420
The deterrent effect obviously
is very tricky to evaluate,

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.620
in the sense that at the level

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:06.200
of what lawyers call specific deterrents,

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:10.230
that's deterring actual
individuals from committing crimes,

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.370
most people, this is sort of parallel

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.020
to the debates about the
death penalty in the US,

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:18.590
most people who murder people

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.530
are not deterred by the death penalty

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.880
because the point of murdering someone

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.280
is a point, first of all,

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:26.450
nobody's thinking about being apprehended

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:31.120
and it's usually seething
hatred, passion, et cetera.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:35.180
And so it's not clear it has
any specific deterrent effect.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.810
Where would it deter others?

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:41.300
That's what we call general
deterrence, it's hard to say.

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.920
I would just point out one thing

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:47.080
that nobody has really
fully thought through

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.000
about this doctrine,
and this is think about

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.200
about my earlier discussion of Hirschmann

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.570
in connection to democratic transitions.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.580
I said that one of the
things that needs to happen

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.150
to get dictators to give up power

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:06.440
is that the cost of exist
must be low, relatively low,

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.520
otherwise they're gonna hang
on until the end of time.

00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:15.520
And so, for instance, Idi
Amin got to live out his life,

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:20.540
ironically, in Libya, after
he was forced out of power.

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:24.450
He had a place where he could go

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:29.080
and he was not prosecuted for anything.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:32.940
Gaddafi, on the other hand,
was referred to the ICC.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:37.253
He was killed before he
was ever brought to trial.

00:38:37.253 --> 00:38:41.100
So, if you're thinking about amnesty

00:38:43.171 --> 00:38:47.460
as part of a negotiated
settlement for a conflict,

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.230
how that would square with this doctrine

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.670
is a difficult thing to think through,

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.750
and there are obviously trade-offs there.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.453
So, it's not obvious,

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.140
it's not obvious how we should
think about this doctrine,

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:08.140
but it is alive, it sort
of wobbled into existence,

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.190
it is subject to all these criticisms,

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:15.970
it's inequitably applied.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:19.670
The US in particular has
been rather hypocritical

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:21.820
in the way that it's used the doctrine

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.270
that it won't allow
itself to be subjected to.

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:27.661
But the norm entrepreneurs would argue

00:39:27.661 --> 00:39:30.260
this is the way that norms

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.510
gradually get established and embedded

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.380
in the international order,

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.720
and so the goal should be to improve it

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.110
and to address its defects

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.940
rather than say that it's
just an illegitimate way

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:48.220
in which some countries beat up others.

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.890
Let's turn to the
Responsibility to Protect,

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:55.700
which is in some ways a much
more ambitious rewriting

00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:57.533
of the international rules.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.103
Anyone know what that is?

00:40:03.776 --> 00:40:05.248
- [Man] Is it (mumbles)?

00:40:05.248 --> 00:40:06.081
- Pardon?

00:40:06.081 --> 00:40:08.860
- [Man] A fire in India at the--

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.000
- No.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.963
Good reasonable guess, yeah.

00:40:13.007 --> 00:40:16.509
- [Man] Is it (mumbles)
genocide and war crimes

00:40:16.509 --> 00:40:19.460
over (mumbles) in Stockholm?

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.460
- Well, it's actually a NATO
bombing of Kosovo in 1999.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:30.960
And the NATO bombing of Kosovo in 1999

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.150
came after many years of civil wars

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:35.640
that had basically broken out

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:40.180
with the collapse of the Soviet Union

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:42.900
and Yugoslavia had come to pieces.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.900
And there was ethnic cleansing
of Albanian Muslim Kosovars

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:53.010
at the hands of Serbian militias going on.

00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:58.010
And the NATO alliance,
notice, the NATO alliance

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.560
took a decision to intervene.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.463
Here's President Clinton talking about it.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:09.750
- The Kosovars have been
victims of terrible atrocities.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:13.040
Their only hope was that the
world would not turn away

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.053
in the face of ethnic
cleansing and killing,

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:19.623
that the world would take a stand.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.233
We did, for 78 days.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:28.680
Because we did, the Kosovars will go home.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.520
To achieve our aims as an alliance,

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.820
19 democratic nations
with 780 million people

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:39.310
working together in the first
sustained military operation

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:40.343
in NATO's history.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.030
The alliance did stay together.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.040
It is now stronger and
more united than ever,

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.330
and I thank my fellow
leaders in the alliance

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.480
for their fidelity and their fortitude.

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:53.940
In the past four months we've seen

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.150
some of the worst in
humanity in our lifetime,

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:00.420
but we've also seen the
bravery of our troops,

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:04.790
the resolve of our democracy,
the decency of our people,

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.733
and the courage and determination
of the people of Kosovo.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.410
We now have a moment of hope
thanks to all those qualities,

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.693
and we have to finish the
job and build the peace.

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:19.623
- So.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.450
What had happened here was that

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.210
this ongoing civil war had resulted

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:32.663
in many human rights
violations on all sides.

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.510
But this was the point at which,

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.840
when there was this imminent
ethnic cleansing in Kosovo,

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.350
that NATO decided to
intervene in mid 1999.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.980
And one thing about this intervention

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.920
was that it was widely
judged to have succeeded,

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.420
that is to say the ethnic cleansing ended

00:42:57.307 --> 00:43:00.740
and didn't re-initiate.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.830
Even though there were no
NATO troops on the ground

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:09.830
in Kosovo, there were
European Union troops

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:12.470
massing on the border, some,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.923
but they never actually went in.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:19.313
It was very unusual for two reasons.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.590
One was that this was a NATO operation

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.020
and it was in violation
of the NATO charter.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.390
We've talked about NATO.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:32.240
You know that Article 5
authorizes NATO members

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:37.240
to use force and indeed to turn
to one another to use force

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:39.900
if any one of them was attacked,

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.120
but no NATO member was threatened

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:47.220
during the Kosovo and the
former Yugoslavia civil war.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.940
There was no threat to any member of NATO.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:54.630
So this was not a legitimate activity

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:59.153
for NATO as a defensive alliance
to have been engaged in.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:04.533
It was also not authorized
by the Security Council.

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:08.310
Why was it not authorized
by the Security Council?

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:12.500
Because the Russians were
basically on the Serbian,

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.030
sympathetic to the Serbian
side in this conflict,

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:18.550
and clearly the Russians and
almost certainly the Chinese

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:22.950
would have vetoed any
attempt to get authorization

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:26.510
for NATO to get involved in this conflict.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:30.250
So there was no Security
Council authorization,

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:35.250
and it was not anything that
one could legitimately say

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.680
was part and parcel of NATO's mandate

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.050
to protect the member states.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.680
They just did it.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.283
They simply did it.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:52.290
Now, one might say, what
were Clinton's motives?

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:55.080
And some have said his motives were

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.133
to divert attention from Monica Lewinsky.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.820
Christopher Hitchens,
among others, claimed that.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:07.820
But even, setting Monica Lewinsky aside,

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:11.760
I think part of Clinton's motivation

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.370
surely was to redeem himself.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:18.730
He had taken so much
criticism after Rwanda

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:23.360
for the US's failure to act
in the Rwandan controversy,

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:27.110
and here he was on the verge
of leaving the presidency,

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.833
this is summer of 1999,

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:38.100
and he thought, "This is
my moment to redeem myself

00:45:39.227 --> 00:45:43.400
"and to show that the
US will in fact act."

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:48.240
And indeed, he enunciated
what some of his biographers

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.400
have called the Clinton Doctrine.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.090
He said here,

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:55.780
shortly after that press
conference I showed you,

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:59.697
he said, "Never forget
if we can do this here

00:45:59.697 --> 00:46:01.717
"and if we can say to people of the world,

00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:04.597
"whether you live in
Africa or Central Europe

00:46:04.597 --> 00:46:05.837
"or any other place,

00:46:05.837 --> 00:46:08.687
"if somebody comes
after innocent civilians

00:46:08.687 --> 00:46:11.617
"and tries to kill them en
masse because of their race,

00:46:11.617 --> 00:46:14.037
"their ethnic background,
or their religion,

00:46:14.037 --> 00:46:18.447
"and it is within our power
to stop it, we will stop it."

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:25.140
Very different than the
stance he took over Rwanda.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.800
And the Secretary General
of the UN was Kofi Annan,

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:34.800
the Ghanaian Secretary
General now deceased,

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.890
he got behind this.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:39.747
He said, "If humanitarian
intervention is, indeed,

00:46:39.747 --> 00:46:42.447
"an unacceptable assault on sovereignty,

00:46:42.447 --> 00:46:46.637
"how should we respond to
a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica,

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:48.847
"to gross and systematic violations

00:46:48.847 --> 00:46:52.920
"that affect every precept
of our common humanity?"

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:55.790
And his answer was, "The
sovereignty of states

00:46:56.677 --> 00:46:59.407
"must no longer be used as a shield

00:46:59.407 --> 00:47:02.920
"for gross violations of human rights."

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.653
This is a dramatic
statement in strong tension,

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:13.520
to put it mildly, with
the charter of the UN.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.040
But the question becomes,
how can you do that?

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.230
How does one do that,

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:21.060
particularly given a
world of nation states

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.330
whose sovereignty is protected?

00:47:23.330 --> 00:47:26.160
And so there was a lot of
hand-wringing and wrestling

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:28.983
with this problem, and, interestingly,

00:47:34.447 --> 00:47:38.193
the Prime Minister of
Sweden took it upon himself

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:43.060
to appoint a Commission on Kosovo,

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.590
which was established in August of 1999.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:49.790
And the Commission reported
with the following statement.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:51.897
It said, "The Commission concludes

00:47:51.897 --> 00:47:54.067
"that the NATO military intervention

00:47:54.067 --> 00:47:57.048
"was illegal but legitimate."

00:47:57.048 --> 00:47:58.400
(audience laughs)

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.317
It was illegal but legitimate.

00:48:01.317 --> 00:48:05.627
"It was illegal because it
did not receive prior approval

00:48:05.627 --> 00:48:07.247
"from the Security Council.

00:48:07.247 --> 00:48:09.657
"However, the Commission considers

00:48:09.657 --> 00:48:11.637
"that the intervention was justified

00:48:11.637 --> 00:48:15.207
"because all diplomatic
avenues had been exhausted

00:48:15.207 --> 00:48:18.637
"and because the
intervention had the effect

00:48:18.637 --> 00:48:21.697
"of liberating the majority
population of Kosovo

00:48:21.697 --> 00:48:26.697
"from a long period of
oppression under Serbian rule."

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.263
Illegal but legitimate.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.823
What can that mean?

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:43.340
What do we, can we say
something is illegal, yes?

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:44.513
You need a microphone,

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.130
we'll need a dissertation here.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.830
Wait a second, get the microphone.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:51.480
They'll never hear you otherwise.

00:48:54.321 --> 00:48:56.320
- [Man] Yeah, I mean, it just seems like

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.480
it's the international community

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.700
trying to reconcile the contradiction

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.860
of, that you just put,
national sovereignty

00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:07.470
but sometimes intervention's good.

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:12.140
This seems like you can't have war

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.720
or the idea of armed intervention

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:19.300
that still respects national sovereignty,

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:23.160
and so it seems like this
is just a halfway return

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:27.580
to the pre-World War II consensus of,

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.013
well, national sovereignty is a given.

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:34.550
- So, it certainly is
a different conception

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:35.930
of national sovereignty,

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:38.090
but we're saying it's
illegal but legitimate,

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:40.650
we can say we can
violate international law

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:43.780
when it's legitimate for us to do so.

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.003
But what legitimates the action?

00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:50.993
How is it legitimate,
what makes it legitimate?

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:00.580
- [Man] Perhaps thinking about the ideas

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.110
that interest institutions?

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:05.500
It's a matter moral interest,

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.063
and especially power interest,

00:50:08.063 --> 00:50:09.953
than institutions in itself.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.863
- One more at the back, yeah?

00:50:17.266 --> 00:50:18.610
Oh okay, yes, sir?

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:21.251
We'll take two more,
you and then you, yeah.

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:24.690
- [Man] I would just say R2P
trumps the international order.

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:25.580
- Say that again.

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.460
- [Man] R2P trumps the
international order.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:29.750
- Responsibility, well,

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:33.230
we don't yet have a doctrine
of R2P at this time, right?

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:37.160
So we will have to see, but yeah.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.760
Okay, the gentleman at the
back, the last one, yeah.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.820
- [Man] The ends justify the means.

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.600
- The ends justify the means.

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.400
So another way of saying that

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.680
and perhaps capturing what
some others were saying

00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.990
is perhaps sometimes it's better

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:01.351
to ask for forgiveness than permission.

00:51:01.351 --> 00:51:02.320
(audience laughs)
Right?

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.890
Sometimes it's better
to ask for forgiveness.

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:08.500
If you know some horrific
thing is about to happen

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:10.280
that you can stop,

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.220
and you also know that if
you ask for permission,

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.110
it's gonna be denied,

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:17.940
maybe you'd better just do it.

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.743
Maybe you'd better just do it.

00:51:22.826 --> 00:51:27.620
And moral philosophers have
debated this principle,

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:30.530
or maybe it's a pragmatic
judgment and not a principle,

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:32.680
but there's a principle
behind it, presumably,

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.900
which is that some things
are so egregiously bad

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.680
and so frightening

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:42.680
that if the legal order
will not permit it,

00:51:42.907 --> 00:51:46.990
it's too bad at some
level for the legal order.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.280
And so this was I think the thinking

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:53.930
behind this idea of
illegal but legitimate.

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.183
But of course, how do you
turn a norm like that,

00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:01.070
how do you turn a dictum
like that into a norm,

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:06.070
much less a rule, how can
you institutionalize the idea

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.520
that it's okay to ask for forgiveness

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.273
rather than permission?

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:14.180
Not obvious how you can do that

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.210
because the whole idea is you're acting

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:18.320
against the existing institutions

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.540
because you've concluded that
it's the right thing to do.

00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:24.750
So how might one institutionalize that?

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:28.530
And it's important to say
that no everybody agreed.

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:30.060
Not everybody agreed.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.093
We say the international community this,

00:52:32.093 --> 00:52:33.327
the international community that.

00:52:33.327 --> 00:52:35.910
The international community didn't agree.

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.510
Not everyone thought that Kosovo
should become a precedent,

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.710
especially in the Global South.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:44.450
The logic was seen as
a potential smokescreen

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:47.290
for major powers to
pursue their own agendas.

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:49.860
Within months, the G77,

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.710
this is a large number of
developing world countries,

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:57.650
condemned the so-called
humanitarian intervention.

00:52:57.650 --> 00:53:01.190
South Africa and India
amplified this criticism.

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:04.610
Nelson Mandela, who had
recently stepped down

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.257
as South Africa's president, said,

00:53:06.257 --> 00:53:10.090
"When two nations," he
wasn't fooled by the idea

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:11.390
that it was a large coaliltion,

00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:13.247
it was basically the US and Britain,

00:53:13.247 --> 00:53:15.537
"take it upon themselves
to police the world

00:53:15.537 --> 00:53:18.247
"without getting
authorization from the UN,

00:53:18.247 --> 00:53:19.607
"we must condemn that,

00:53:19.607 --> 00:53:22.850
"because it can lead
to another world war."

00:53:22.850 --> 00:53:24.170
The South African government,

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:26.760
reflecting the positions
of the Non-Aligned Movement

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.857
and the OAU, declared,
"Unilateral intervention,

00:53:29.857 --> 00:53:34.857
"no matter how noble the
pretext, is not acceptable."

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:37.687
India called the Kosovo operation

00:53:37.687 --> 00:53:40.947
"a flagrant violation of
all international norms,

00:53:40.947 --> 00:53:43.457
"against the provisions of the UN Charter,

00:53:43.457 --> 00:53:48.457
"and seen as a direct and
unprovoked aggression."

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:54.910
So, as I said, there
wasn't consensus about this

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:57.600
by any means across the Global South,

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:00.890
particularly because
this was a NATO operation

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:02.923
led by the US.

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.070
So that led to the, it was followed by,

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:10.370
I shouldn't say led, it wasn't caused,

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:14.160
but it was followed by an
International Commission

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:16.240
on Intervention and State Sovereignty

00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.360
that was convened in London,

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.330
again, with input from
the UN and various NGOs.

00:54:21.330 --> 00:54:25.170
And it was chaired by Gareth Evans,

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:29.123
a former Australian prime minister,

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.980
Mohamed Sahnoun, who was
an Algerian diplomat,

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.490
and a major player in it
was the Canadian academic

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:41.270
and sometimes not very
successful Canadian politician

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:42.263
Michael Ignatieff.

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:45.410
And they came up with this idea

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:48.223
of the Responsibility to Protect.

00:54:51.183 --> 00:54:53.750
We'll talk in some depth
about it in a minute

00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:56.470
but I want to note, first of all,

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:59.910
that the concept of the
Responsibility to Protect

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:03.530
is as important for what it doesn't say

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:05.690
as for what it does say.

00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:08.960
It doesn't say that there's any right.

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.520
It's talking about a responsibility.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.900
It doesn't say that there's a right.

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.630
The responsibility here is not,

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:18.210
there's not a responsibility

00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:19.630
on the UN or on the Security Council

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:20.967
but a responsibility,

00:55:20.967 --> 00:55:23.890
and the phrase Responsibility to Protect

00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:25.570
refers to governments.

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:29.320
Governments have a
responsibility to protect

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.610
not only their citizens

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:33.933
but people living within
their territories.

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:41.210
And it doesn't talk about
an obligation to intervene.

00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:43.490
Even though it suggests

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:45.470
there's some kind of
imperative for action,

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:48.520
it doesn't say when you have certain kinds

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:51.900
of rights violations, there's
an obligation to intervene.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.653
I'll say of this more later.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:01.080
Again, in the Global South,
this was not welcomed.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:04.377
And the African Union said,

00:56:04.377 --> 00:56:07.467
"Well, if the UN is gonna
start taking it upon itself

00:56:07.467 --> 00:56:11.530
"to authorize intervening in
other countries, so are we."

00:56:11.530 --> 00:56:14.497
And so the African
Union asserted the right

00:56:14.497 --> 00:56:17.180
"to intervene in a member
state," that's pretty much,

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.220
I think there's 50 members
of the African Union,

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.087
almost every African country,

00:56:21.087 --> 00:56:23.347
"pursuant to a decision by the Assembly,

00:56:23.347 --> 00:56:26.017
"in grave circumstances,
namely war crimes,

00:56:26.017 --> 00:56:29.760
"genocide, and crimes against humanity."

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.490
And notice that there's no
mention of the Security Council

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.170
despite the fact that the UN Charter

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:38.950
reserves to the Security Council

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:45.870
a monopoly on declaring
non-defensive use of force.

00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.667
So, essentially, the
African Union is saying,

00:56:48.667 --> 00:56:53.317
"Well, if the Security Council
or NATO or other groups

00:56:53.317 --> 00:56:56.127
"are going to start
intervening in countries,

00:56:56.127 --> 00:56:57.590
"then so are we."

00:56:57.590 --> 00:57:02.590
And so the stability
envisaged in the NATO Charter

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:05.923
could be seemed to be threatened.

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:10.490
In 2005, the UN General Assembly

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:15.490
debated this so-called World
Summit Outcome Document

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:21.240
and adopted it, behaving now
as a kind of legislature.

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:23.730
That is to say,

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:25.500
remember what I said at the
beginning of the lecture,

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:29.075
that the UN is a creature of a treaty,

00:57:29.075 --> 00:57:32.620
the General Assembly is not a legislature.

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:37.527
But in any case, they adopted
this provision and they said,

00:57:37.527 --> 00:57:40.177
"Each individual state," country,

00:57:40.177 --> 00:57:42.837
"has the responsibility
to protect its populations

00:57:42.837 --> 00:57:46.177
"from genocide, war
crimes, ethnic cleansing,

00:57:46.177 --> 00:57:48.077
"and crimes against humanity."

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:52.280
These all have complex legal definitions

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.737
which people wrangle over.

00:57:54.737 --> 00:57:58.397
"This responsibility entails
the prevention of such crimes,

00:57:58.397 --> 00:58:00.187
"including their incitement,

00:58:00.187 --> 00:58:02.327
"through appropriate and necessary means.

00:58:02.327 --> 00:58:04.837
"We," this is the UN General Assembly,

00:58:04.837 --> 00:58:06.477
"accept that responsibility

00:58:06.477 --> 00:58:09.457
"and will act within accordance of it.

00:58:09.457 --> 00:58:12.197
"We are prepared to
take collective action,

00:58:12.197 --> 00:58:14.387
"in a timely and decisive manner,

00:58:14.387 --> 00:58:16.167
"through the Security Council,

00:58:16.167 --> 00:58:19.467
"on a case-by-case
basis and in cooperation

00:58:19.467 --> 00:58:23.667
"with relevant regional
organizations as appropriate,

00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:26.347
"should peaceful means be inadequate

00:58:26.347 --> 00:58:31.097
"and national authorities manifestly fail

00:58:31.097 --> 00:58:35.147
"to protect their populations
from genocide, war crimes,

00:58:35.147 --> 00:58:40.147
"ethnic cleansing, and
crimes against humanity."

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:43.620
So here you have the UN General Assembly

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.550
taking it upon itself to say

00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:48.610
there's a responsibility to protect,

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.410
it falls on governments,

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:56.203
and if they don't live up
to that responsibility,

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.860
the Security Council can authorize

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:04.053
regional organizations and
other players to intervene.

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:09.140
That's hugely important because the UN

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:11.560
does not really have much of an army,

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.990
and UN peacekeepers traditionally

00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:18.810
have only gone into conflicts
once peace is established,

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:21.810
as we saw at the very beginning
with the Rwanda picture.

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:26.390
They don't go in to actually
get involved in peacemaking,

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:27.673
but only in peacekeeping.

00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:32.270
So some things to think about

00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:35.040
with the Responsibility to Protect.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:40.040
First of all, unlike the ICC,

00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:44.200
it's binding on signatories
and non-signatories alike.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.370
So they have declared unilaterally

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:49.123
that this doctrine is
binding on all governments.

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:54.850
They restricted it to these
four major categories of crimes:

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:57.330
genocide, crimes against humanity,

00:59:57.330 --> 00:59:59.900
war crimes, and ethnic cleansing.

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:03.300
Even though the (mumbles) commission

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:07.280
had wanted a much more
expansive set of things

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:08.680
to protect against,

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.390
but the thinking was that in order

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.010
to get a majority to accept it,

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.480
it would have to remain focused

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.110
on the most egregious violations.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:30.870
The domestic focus here
seems that, indeed,

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:33.560
does contradict the UN Charter's focus

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.830
on international peace and security,

01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:40.360
because now, in effect, what R2P has said

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:45.360
is that it is legitimate for
the international community,

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:49.210
as represented by the United Nations

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:52.410
and authorized by the Security Council,

01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:56.188
to intervene in the domestic
affairs of a country,

01:00:56.188 --> 01:01:01.188
if it's triggered by one of those,

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.290
genocide, crimes against humanity,

01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:07.143
war crimes, or ethnic cleansing.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:12.130
Another feature of it that's worth noting,

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:16.120
and this, again, goes to
my earlier observation

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.610
that there's no right
to demand intervention.

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:24.220
It's not binding on the
Security Council to intervene.

01:01:24.220 --> 01:01:26.630
As I said, it gives wide latitude

01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:29.690
as to when the Security
Council will be intervening,

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:34.300
because it intervenes
on a case-by-case basis.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:38.740
So the Security Council may intervene,

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.030
but there's nothing in
this doctrine which says

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:43.340
the Security Council must intervene

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:45.900
in any particular conflict,

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.993
and that will turn out to be important.

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:54.120
The Non-Aligned Movement didn't like it.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.060
And the Non-Aligned Movement is a group

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.810
of mostly middle-income
countries around the world.

01:02:00.810 --> 01:02:05.703
So, how should we think
about this doctrine?

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.050
This is obviously, as I said,

01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:16.050
both the ICC and the
Responsibility to Protect

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.600
are starting to rewrite

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.930
the international
architecture of intervention,

01:02:23.930 --> 01:02:27.820
but this is a much more
ambitious rewriting than the ICC

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:29.690
and we're now not talking about

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:32.100
prosecuting a few individual perpetrators,

01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:35.210
we're actually talking about
intervening in countries

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.090
during ongoing conflicts

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.120
to make peace and to stop
gross human rights violations.

01:02:47.506 --> 01:02:49.183
Is this a good move?

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.510
Who thinks it's a good
move, somebody wanna...

01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:54.633
Okay, yes, ma'am?

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:06.763
- [Woman] More norm setting?

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:11.450
- So say a little bit more
about the norm setting.

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:12.817
- I don't know much more.

01:03:12.817 --> 01:03:14.870
(audience laughs)

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:18.673
It seems like it would be a
good norm to have for humanity.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:22.691
- Okay, it's certainly a norm.

01:03:22.691 --> 01:03:26.483
It seems like it's gone
beyond a norm now, right?

01:03:26.483 --> 01:03:30.603
This is really changing
international institutions, right?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.600
We now have the Security
Council in a position

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.490
to actually intervene.

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:41.670
It is, if you like, a common law,

01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:46.670
by which I mean a gradual but
nonetheless decisive rewriting

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:53.590
of the rules governing UN intervention

01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.833
within the affairs of governments.

01:03:57.014 --> 01:04:00.240
It doesn't mean it's good or
bad, but it's very expensive.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.130
Any other?

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:02.963
Yes, sir?

01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:05.350
Wait, wait a second.

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:14.170
- [Man] I think it's highly contradictory,

01:04:14.170 --> 01:04:19.170
and any country can,
depending on its own utility,

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.450
can decide whether to consider
it as a genocide or not.

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:26.153
And I can give two examples.

01:04:27.070 --> 01:04:32.070
The US was highly quick in
setting the war affairs in Syria,

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:39.260
while in Ukraine, when the radicals

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:43.820
just broke into the Opera House in Odessa,

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:46.020
it was kind of okay because--

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.730
- So there may be disagreement

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:50.733
as to whether the
conditions prevail or not?

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:54.120
At least in some cases.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.950
- [Man] I mean I think
it can be still biased,

01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:59.010
depending on the--

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:00.870
- It can be manipulated.
- Yes.

01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:02.080
- It could be manipulated,

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:04.430
but any doctrine can be manipulated.

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:08.690
Just to play devil's advocate
to your comment for a minute,

01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:11.630
let's go back to Rwanda in 1994.

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:15.910
The fact is no one had any
doubt in Rwanda in 1994

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:17.653
that genocide was going on.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.480
You could go back now through the archives

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:28.450
and it's perfectly plain that
all the major powers knew

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:31.830
that genocide was imminent
and then that it was starting

01:05:31.830 --> 01:05:33.710
and then it went on for many months.

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:36.643
Now, they might not have
been able to stop it,

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:38.910
it might not have been successful,

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:43.170
but the book I put on the syllabus

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:48.090
I think is probably the best on this.

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:50.170
Certainly the estimates are

01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:53.950
that of the 800,000 to
a million people killed,

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.280
had there been intervention,

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.040
at least 200,000 people
could've been saved.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.920
So you could say, well, there'd
still be 600,000 killed.

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:05.810
Yes, but 200,000 people's not
a trivial number of people

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:10.070
to save, even if that's double
what really could have been,

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:11.650
it still would've been.

01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:12.763
So that would be,

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.040
there might be cases
where it's manipulable,

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:21.040
there might be cases where it's unclear,

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.640
where it's disputed,

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:26.060
and we'll talk about one of
those cases in a few classes,

01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.303
three classes from today.

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:31.790
So, yeah.

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:35.240
Any other thoughts about
whether this is a good way

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.833
for international law of
intervention to evolve, yeah?

01:06:40.670 --> 01:06:43.280
- [Man] Within the constraint
of there being a veto,

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.890
it's an establishment of
some kind of world government

01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:51.410
as a legitimate user of force,
and I would support that.

01:06:51.410 --> 01:06:53.463
- You like the idea that there's a veto?

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.620
- [Man] No, I like the idea

01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:59.020
that there's a legitimate use
of force in this instance.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.250
But it does basically change

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:01.950
the charter of the United Nations.

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:06.010
But it has the constraint
still that there is veto--

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:08.450
- There's a veto in the
Security Council, yeah.

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:09.720
The permanent members,

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.910
there are now permanent members
and non-permanent members

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.366
of the Security Council,

01:07:13.366 --> 01:07:15.266
but the original five still have veto.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.653
Okay, so.

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:23.073
Anyone think it's a bad idea?

01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.730
We'll defer judgment of that
question a little while.

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:32.980
So here were some early
tests of this doctrine.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.800
This is actually before the
Outcome had been adopted

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.963
by the General Assembly in Sudan.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:44.540
The Security Council
called for an arms embargo

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:47.763
and referred to the idea, it
was still being debated then.

01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:52.410
In Kenya in 2006, after the election,

01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:54.710
there was an eruption of ethnic violence,

01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:57.020
800 people were killed,

01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:59.440
more than 1/4 of a million were displaced,

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:04.100
and the French called for a
Responsibility to Protect action

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.780
to intervene.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:08.523
Kofi Annan headed it off, basically,

01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:13.810
by going and negotiating a settlement.

01:08:13.810 --> 01:08:16.570
And some argued that it was the threat

01:08:16.570 --> 01:08:19.590
of the possibility of intervention

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:24.590
that actually helped him
negotiate or mediate the conflict

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:30.750
in a way that headed off the
violence, or damped it down.

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:37.290
In Guinea in 2008 there
was an attempted coup.

01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:42.000
The leader Camara's troops
rioted against demonstrators,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:45.270
and by then it was Ban Ki-moon
who was Secretary General.

01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:48.740
He set up an inquiry and
raised the possibility

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:50.410
of crimes against humanity

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:52.437
and started again talking about R2P.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:57.220
The US and the EU suspended assistance

01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:01.840
but it became moot after
Camara fled the country.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.340
And so, again, they were on the verge

01:09:08.161 --> 01:09:10.590
of intervening on the grounds

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:16.460
that there were gross human
rights violations going on,

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.580
but then they actually didn't.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:23.580
And then in 2011, I
mentioned to you earlier,

01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:29.450
that the Security Council
unanimously, including the US,

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:34.450
referred Gaddafi to the
ICC for prosecution.

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.660
But in the course of that referral,

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:41.380
they talked about the
Responsibility to Protect

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:44.970
being triggered possibly in Libya.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:47.803
This was in February of 2011.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.970
They were hinting already
that there might be,

01:09:53.970 --> 01:09:57.900
this is following the
outbreak of the Arab Spring.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:02.900
We've had eruptions in
Tunisia and in Egypt

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:08.540
and now in Libya.

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:13.540
Civil war breaks out and there
were claims, disputed claims,

01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:20.743
about imminent slaughter in Benghazi.

01:10:21.730 --> 01:10:25.260
Much disputed, and we will
talk about the disputes later.

01:10:25.260 --> 01:10:30.260
In any event, they
referred Gaddafi to the ICC

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.410
and they talked about the
Responsibility to Protect

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:40.030
and used that to impose an
arms embargo on the country

01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:44.180
and various other sanctions.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:49.180
The first real test of R2P
came the following month,

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:55.710
when the Security Council
adopted UN Resolution 1973

01:10:57.350 --> 01:11:01.270
authorizing intervention
in the Libyan conflict.

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:05.720
And we'll return to that on October 24th

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.240
and we'll then think about,

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:10.950
at the end of that examination

01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:13.930
we'll see what we think
about the future prospects

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:17.410
for the doctrine of
Responsibility to Protect.

01:11:17.410 --> 01:11:21.260
But first we need to attend
to the Global War on Terror,

01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:22.900
which fundamentally changed

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:25.860
the international legal
and political landscape

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:28.450
in ways that affected the prospects

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:31.787
for doctrines like the
Responsibility to Protect,

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.953
and we'll do that starting next time.

01:11:36.723 --> 01:11:39.306
(gentle music)

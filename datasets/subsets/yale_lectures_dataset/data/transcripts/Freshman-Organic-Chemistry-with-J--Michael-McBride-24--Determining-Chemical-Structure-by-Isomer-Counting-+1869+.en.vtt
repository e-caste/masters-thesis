00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:05.561
Prof: We've been going
through the generations of

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:09.030
organic chemistry,
from Lavoisier to Berzelius and

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.931
Gay-Lussac,
to Dumas, Liebig and Woehler,

00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:16.390
and last time we got to Couper,
and began with Kekulé,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.980
talking about their discovery,
or invention really,

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.452
of valence;
in particular the tetravalence

00:00:23.452 --> 00:00:25.780
and the self-linking of carbon.
 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.836
But the other thing that
Kekulé

00:00:27.836 --> 00:00:30.560
is most noted for is the
structure of benzene,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.654
and we started looking at that
a little bit last time with his

00:00:34.654 --> 00:00:37.540
sausage diagrams for drawing a
structure.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.240
And this time we'll go on in
more detail with that idea in

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.281
the determination of actual
position in molecules,

00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:49.580
the positions of atoms in
molecules.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.660
And this is largely due to
students of Kekulé,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.200
so the next generation:
Wilhelm Koerner,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.820
who was both in Germany and in
Italy,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.960
as you'll see,
and Jacobus Henricus van't

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.049
Hoff,
from the Netherlands,

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.751
and also Albert Ladenburg,
from Germany,

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:11.840
and we'll even have a little
message of your own --

00:01:11.840 --> 00:02:23.240
&lt;&lt;technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.431
Okay, so we -- Koerner,
van't Hoff, Ladenburg and

00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:33.877
E.P. Kohler,
who is your

00:02:33.877 --> 00:02:40.318
great-great-grandfather
academically.

00:02:40.318 --> 00:02:43.419
Okay, so benzene and molecular
structure.

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.560
This is the simplest of the
so-called aromatic compounds.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.729
Obviously the name comes from
the smell,

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:52.497
that it has an aroma,
but it was generalized from

00:02:52.497 --> 00:02:56.399
benzene which --
benzene was discovered in 1825

00:02:56.399 --> 00:03:00.878
by Faraday who isolated what he
called bicarburet of

00:03:00.878 --> 00:03:03.592
hydrogen,
which was C_2H,

00:03:03.592 --> 00:03:07.364
according to his formula,
but actually it's C_6H_6,

00:03:07.364 --> 00:03:10.552
because he had the carbon
doubled and it's six times what

00:03:10.552 --> 00:03:11.750
he thought it was.
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.408
And he got it from gas oil,
which is a byproduct.

00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:16.522
Quite a bit,
you get a gallon -- or they did

00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:19.090
at least then;
I don't know what happens

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.580
nowadays -- for making 1000
cubic feet of the oil,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.530
that was an illuminating oil;
illuminating gas, pardon me.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.552
So in 1833 Mitscherlich named
the compound benzine,

00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:34.449
instead of bicarburet of
hydrogen.

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.120
And the origin of the name is
interesting.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.710
It came from gum benzoin,
via benzoic acid.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.890
So you knocked the CO_2,
somehow, off of benzoic acid,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.598
and you get what Mitscherlich
called benzine.

00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:51.710
Now gum benzoin itself has an
interesting etymology,

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.840
because it came originally from
luban jawi,

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.810
which I'm told is Arabic,
meaning frankincense --

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.300
that's luban -- and
jawi is from java.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.389
So it came from the southeast
Asia.

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.373
But when the French saw this
name, they assumed that

00:04:06.373 --> 00:04:09.359
lu was like le,
la, les,

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.939
and so on, the article.
 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.038
So they knocked it off.
 

00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:16.245
So it became ban jawi,
which doesn't mean anything in

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:20.240
Arabic, but that then became
benzoin and then benzine.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.608
Okay?
 

00:04:20.608 --> 00:04:23.923
The French, in 1841,
named the alcohol version

00:04:23.923 --> 00:04:27.535
acide phénique,
because it's acidic,

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:29.819
and we'll see why shortly.
 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.545
We call it phenol,
and we call C_6H_5 phenyl,

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:37.016
and abbreviate it Ph for
phenyl, or Î¦,

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:39.810
the Greek letter,
for phenyl.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.458
And it comes from
phainein,

00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:47.113
which means to bring light,
because of its association with

00:04:47.113 --> 00:04:48.800
illuminating gas.
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.795
Okay, so we know that
Kekulé's structure for

00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:56.711
benzene is hexagonal,
even though he wrote it with

00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:59.430
that sausage thing originally.
 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.009
Now why?
 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:03.088
On what basis did he think it
was hexagonal?

00:05:03.088 --> 00:05:06.076
Well this is the paper where he
proposed it's hexagonal,

00:05:06.076 --> 00:05:08.685
and I'll show you all the
evidence he gave in his

00:05:08.685 --> 00:05:10.750
arguments for its being a
hexagon.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.463
First, "All aromatic
compounds"

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:14.762
(so,
for example,

00:05:14.762 --> 00:05:18.601
benzaldehyde as well as benzene
and so on) "even the

00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:22.509
simplest are significantly
richer in carbon than analogous

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.350
compounds from the class of
fatty substances."

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.761
Okay, so it's rich in carbon;
that's the first evidence that

00:05:29.761 --> 00:05:30.930
it's a hexagon.
 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.447
The second is that
"Aromatic compounds,

00:05:33.447 --> 00:05:36.490
as for fatty compounds,
there are numerous homologous

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.478
substances;
that is, those who composition

00:05:39.478 --> 00:05:43.769
differ by an integral number of
CH_2 groups."

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:48.187
So if you replace a hydrogen by
a methyl group,

00:05:48.187 --> 00:05:50.300
you add CH_2,
right?

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.226
Or if you put a CH_2 into a C-C
bond, it becomes a little bit

00:05:55.226 --> 00:05:56.870
longer, a homolog.
 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.240
So there are homologous
substances in the aromatic

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.860
series.
 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.750
The third line of evidence was,
"The simplest aromatic

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.240
compounds contain at least six
carbon atoms."

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.220
Okay?
 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.060
And the fourth line of evidence
is,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.800
"All reaction products
from aromatic substances show a

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.658
certain family similarity,
constituting the group of

00:06:18.658 --> 00:06:20.410
'aromatic' compounds.
 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.850
More vigorous reaction can
remove part of the carbon,

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.839
but the major product contains
at least six carbon atoms,

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.889
and decomposition stops at this
point,

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.771
unless there is complete
destruction of the organic

00:06:31.771 --> 00:06:32.300
group."
 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.399
For example, burning it.
 

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:37.370
And that's it.
 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.329
Those are the four lines of
evidence.

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:44.529
So would you conclude from that
that benzene is a hexagon?

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:45.949
It's quite a stretch.
 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.016
So was this just a wild guess,
based on the idea that carbon

00:06:50.016 --> 00:06:51.670
should be tetravalent?
 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.076
And even in a sense that
doesn't help much because

00:06:54.076 --> 00:06:56.925
there's a question of what you
do with that last valence of

00:06:56.925 --> 00:06:57.810
carbon, right?
 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.447
So he did have some support for
this, but he didn't cite it in

00:07:02.447 --> 00:07:03.360
the paper.
 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.550
He didn't publish it until
later.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:06.790
It had to do with counting
isomers.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:14.540
So, remember this was the
formula he drew in 1865 of

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.769
chlorobenzene.
 

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:18.970
But in the next year,
when he started trying actually

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.954
to say that it was a hexagon,
he drew a hexagon -- he didn't

00:07:22.954 --> 00:07:25.709
try to use his sausages at this
point --

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:29.120
and he contrasted it with what
you get with a triangle of

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.415
carbons,
with a carbon in the middle of

00:07:32.415 --> 00:07:33.379
each edge.
 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:36.829
Okay, so he labels the
vertices, the carbon atoms,

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:40.069
a, b, c, d,
e, f, and counts isomers.

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:42.490
And this is his table of that
count.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.190
So monobromobenzene,
there's only one form.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.487
Right?
 

00:07:46.487 --> 00:07:49.507
Obviously if it were a chain of
six carbons, you could have it

00:07:49.507 --> 00:07:51.985
on the end, or the carbon that
was next to the end,

00:07:51.985 --> 00:07:53.569
or the carbon next to that.
 

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:54.860
Right? So there'd be isomers.
 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.266
But, in fact,
only one was known,

00:07:57.266 --> 00:07:58.170
monobromo.
 

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.649
Now how about dibromobenzene?
 

00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:04.264
It turns out that there are
three modifications,

00:08:04.264 --> 00:08:07.879
he says: ab,
ac, and ad.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:11.310
How about ae?
 

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.430
ae would be next nearest
neighbors, like ac,

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.620
and af would be like
ab.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.209
Okay, so three modifications.
 

00:08:18.209 --> 00:08:24.329
That's consistent with its
being a hexagon.

00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:29.250
Now how about tribromobenzene?
 

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.790
There are three;
drei modificationen.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.740
Okay, abc.
 

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.639
So all successive, right?
 

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:37.409
Or skip one.
 

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:41.200
How about if you skip two?
 

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.179
How about abe;
 

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:46.399
should we have that one?
 

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:51.919
How about abe?
 

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:54.220
Kate, what do you say?
 

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.840
Should we count abe as
another one?

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.419
Steve, what do you say?
 

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.649
Student:  No.
 

00:09:05.649 --> 00:09:08.950
Prof: Why not?
 

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.370
Because I asked?
 

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.890
Student:  Well because
on the thing it says abc,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.090
abd, and ace.
 

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.950
Prof: Yes,
but I wonder if you agree.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.090
Maybe he's wrong.
 

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.929
There's precedent for people
being wrong.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.538
Sam?
 

00:09:24.538 --> 00:09:26.936
Student:  Isn't --
abd is the same as

00:09:26.936 --> 00:09:27.558
abe.
 

00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:30.251
Prof: Right,
because if you count the other

00:09:30.251 --> 00:09:32.668
way, bae is the same as
abd.

00:09:32.668 --> 00:09:33.009
Right?
 

00:09:33.009 --> 00:09:36.344
You go two in a row and then
skip one, just go the other way

00:09:36.344 --> 00:09:36.909
around.
 

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:37.840
Okay?
 

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.216
Because it shouldn't make any
difference which way you go

00:09:40.216 --> 00:09:40.600
around.
 

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.840
Okay?
 

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.429
Or there would be ace -- right?
 

00:09:45.429 --> 00:09:46.690
-- where you skip every time.
 

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:48.789
But there's only one way of
doing that.

00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:50.450
Okay, so three modifications.
 

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.404
And if you go to four,
five, six, it's the same thing,

00:09:53.404 --> 00:09:56.639
except hydrogens are what you
count instead of bromines.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:57.840
Okay?
 

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.774
So that was consistent with
experimental observation of how

00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:06.048
many isomers there were of these
mono-, di-, and tri-substituted

00:10:06.048 --> 00:10:06.929
benzenes.
 

00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:07.590
Yes?
 

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.590
Student:  What was he
using to observe these

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:12.870
modifications?
 

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.804
What technique --
Prof: So how would he

00:10:15.804 --> 00:10:18.577
know they were different,
that there were three different

00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:19.269
substances?
 

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:20.678
Suppose he had them.
 

00:10:20.678 --> 00:10:22.070
He had to prepare them of
course.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.190
Maybe they were not preparable
-- right?

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:27.379
-- in which case you'd have a
count that was too low.

00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:29.509
But how would you know you had
three different things?

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:31.700
How could you tell things were
different?

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.740
Yes?
 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.600
Student:  Boiling point.
 

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.639
Prof: Boiling point;
melting point;

00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:38.129
color maybe,
although these aren't colored;

00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:40.070
density.
 

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.668
Okay?
 

00:10:40.668 --> 00:10:43.120
Some physical property you have
to measure.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:43.620
Right?
 

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.907
The analysis obviously is going
to be the same,

00:10:45.907 --> 00:10:47.200
because they're isomers.
 

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.750
And of course,
if you're not very good at

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.683
measuring things,
you might get a melting point

00:10:52.683 --> 00:10:56.000
between two samples that differs
by two degrees.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.418
You guys are experienced in lab.
 

00:10:57.418 --> 00:11:01.240
Does that mean they're
different?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.120
What do you say Wilson?
 

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.980
Your experience is that it
doesn't tell they're different?

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:06.840
Okay.
 

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.690
So it's not trivial.
 

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.519
You have to be a good
experimentalist.

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:12.629
You have to be able to prepare
them and you have to be able to

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:14.668
tell when things are the same
and when they're different.

00:11:14.668 --> 00:11:17.158
But if you do,
then you can count isomers.

00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:19.729
But you have to bear this in
the back of your mind that you

00:11:19.729 --> 00:11:22.076
might be making a mistake
because of your experimental

00:11:22.076 --> 00:11:22.830
observations.
 

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.230
Okay, now how about if it were
a triangle, right?

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.610
Then if you had a
monobromobenzene,

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:32.879
you could have the bromo either
at a or at b;

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:35.332
although it's conceivable you
couldn't prepare one of them,

00:11:35.332 --> 00:11:37.490
or one of them would be
reactive for some reason.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.720
Okay?
 

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:43.322
And if you had two,
you could have ab,

00:11:43.322 --> 00:11:46.041
or ac,
or bd,

00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:47.820
or ad.
 

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.979
There'd be four modifications
instead of three,

00:11:50.979 --> 00:11:53.590
assuming you could prepare them
all.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.876
Right?
 

00:11:53.876 --> 00:11:56.754
And then you can go on to the
tribromo and see there would be

00:11:56.754 --> 00:11:57.090
six.
 

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:02.513
Okay, so by counting isomers,
you could get information about

00:12:02.513 --> 00:12:03.960
the structure.
 

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.668
Okay?
 

00:12:04.668 --> 00:12:08.495
In fact, the paper that I
xeroxed this from had written

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.259
in,
in old brown ink,

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:13.019
the letters from the bottom
u,

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:16.639
k, e, k, e, l,
going around the ring,

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:19.769
for a, b, c, d, e, f.
 

00:12:19.769 --> 00:12:23.552
And written next to these
things was names for the

00:12:23.552 --> 00:12:27.110
compounds;
elukek and so on;

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.784
ekeluk,
ekulek,

00:12:28.784 --> 00:12:30.700
for the order of these things.
 

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.220
Do you see what's funny?
 

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.629
Student:  They're
anagrams of Kekulé.

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:34.749
Prof: Right.
 

00:12:34.749 --> 00:12:37.282
No, ekulek,
they said, was Arabic for

00:12:37.282 --> 00:12:40.738
hexagon;
that's what was written in the

00:12:40.738 --> 00:12:41.298
book.
 

00:12:41.298 --> 00:12:45.460
So you've got humorists in all
ages.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.923
Okay, now let's try applying
the idea of isomer count to see

00:12:49.923 --> 00:12:53.934
if we can distinguish,
among Dewar's models of benzene

00:12:53.934 --> 00:12:55.600
that I showed you.
 

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.255
So first there's the one top
and center, which is what we

00:12:59.255 --> 00:13:02.259
call the Kekulé
structure of benzene;

00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:03.575
okay, single bond,
double bond,

00:13:03.575 --> 00:13:04.759
single bond,
double bond.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.580
How many isomers?
 

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.514
Okay, how many monosubstituted
isomers, if you put just one

00:13:11.514 --> 00:13:12.620
bromine in?
 

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:17.333
And if that were the structure,
a faithful representation of

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:20.931
the arrangement,
how many different ones could

00:13:20.931 --> 00:13:21.889
you get?
 

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:22.668
Just one.
 

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:25.274
Okay all the hydrogens are,
in that sense,

00:13:25.274 --> 00:13:26.100
equivalent.
 

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.620
Okay, how about if they're di,
how many could you get?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.865
There's one,
two, three, four,

00:13:33.865 --> 00:13:34.649
five.
 

00:13:34.649 --> 00:13:36.929
Right?
 

00:13:36.929 --> 00:13:41.559
So are they all different?
 

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:43.330
Kate, what do you say?
 

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.600
Student:  The purple and
the red are the same -- .

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.409
Prof: You say the purple
and the red are the same.

00:13:49.409 --> 00:13:50.340
Anything else?
 

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.649
Student:  The two blue
ones.

00:13:51.649 --> 00:13:54.500
Prof: The two blues are
the same.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.259
Now does everybody agree with
that?

00:13:57.259 --> 00:13:58.190
Sherwin?
 

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.212
Student:  With the
purple you've got the red ones

00:14:00.212 --> 00:14:01.058
across a double bond.
 

00:14:01.058 --> 00:14:02.520
Prof: Ah ha!
 

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:07.057
the red one is across a square,
and the purple one is across

00:14:07.057 --> 00:14:08.750
just a single bond.
 

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:09.778
Right?
 

00:14:09.778 --> 00:14:13.110
So those are different,
if this model is faithful in

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:14.090
that respect.
 

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:14.940
Okay?
 

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.928
So, but we should take that one
out, because that one goes

00:14:17.928 --> 00:14:20.080
across both a square and a
single bond.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.059
&lt;&lt;computer tone
sounds&gt;&gt;

00:14:22.059 --> 00:14:24.808
Ah, that's somebody else;
okay.

00:14:24.808 --> 00:14:29.168
Okay, now so there'd be four
disubstituted isomers if it were

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:31.928
that, and Kekulé
found three.

00:14:31.928 --> 00:14:32.246
Right?
 

00:14:32.246 --> 00:14:34.419
Now how about if it were this
structure?

00:14:34.419 --> 00:14:37.440
How many monos?
 

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.702
If you replace just one
hydrogen, how many different

00:14:40.702 --> 00:14:41.470
hydrogens?
 

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.320
Elizabeth?
 

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.000
Student:  Six.
 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.985
Prof: Six.
 

00:14:43.985 --> 00:14:45.320
They're all different.
 

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.308
Right?
 

00:14:46.308 --> 00:14:47.541
So there'll be six monos.
 

00:14:47.541 --> 00:14:48.279
How many di's?
 

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:49.500
Well let's count them.
 

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.029
So we'll start from the top
left there.

00:14:52.029 --> 00:14:55.306
There would be those sets of
di's, the ones connected by

00:14:55.306 --> 00:14:56.200
those arrows.
 

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.500
And then we could start from
the top --

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.528
pardon me, five of those --
then we could start from that

00:15:00.528 --> 00:15:04.100
one and there'd be four,
and three, and two additional

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.830
ones,
and one, from that,

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.950
that hasn't been counted
before.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:12.210
So we'd have fifteen
disubstituted isomers.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:13.210
Right?
 

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.450
Now how about these?
 

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.831
Notice for these two that in
both cases it's AA,

00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:19.668
BB, AA.
 

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:22.241
In the bottom one it's turned
on its side, but the same

00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:23.909
relationship,
the symmetry of it.

00:15:23.909 --> 00:15:24.970
Right?
 

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.428
Everybody see that?
 

00:15:27.428 --> 00:15:30.042
Okay, so these will have the
same number of isomers,

00:15:30.042 --> 00:15:32.706
even though their structures
are obviously different,

00:15:32.706 --> 00:15:34.500
but the same number of isomers.
 

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.519
So there'll be two
monosubstituted isomers,

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:40.529
either an A or a B.
 

00:15:40.529 --> 00:15:43.729
And now we've got the di's to
figure out, and it turns out

00:15:43.729 --> 00:15:44.740
there'll be six.
 

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.889
I'll let you do that yourself.
 

00:15:46.889 --> 00:15:48.879
Okay, so two six there.
 

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:51.688
Now how about if it were this,
which is AA,

00:15:51.688 --> 00:15:55.100
BB, CC, because it doesn't have
as much symmetry.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.120
The red ones don't have as much
symmetry as the blue ones,

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.399
although they're the same as
one another.

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:03.826
So it turns out there are three
monos, A or B or C,

00:16:03.826 --> 00:16:07.287
and there are nine di's;
and you can work those out if

00:16:07.287 --> 00:16:08.038
you want to.
 

00:16:08.038 --> 00:16:10.580
Okay, so you can't distinguish
among the red ones,

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.975
or between the blue ones,
but you can distinguish a black

00:16:13.975 --> 00:16:17.278
one from an aqua one,
from a blue, from a red.

00:16:17.278 --> 00:16:19.998
Okay, so again you can get
information about structure by

00:16:19.998 --> 00:16:22.086
counting isomers,
if you're good enough,

00:16:22.086 --> 00:16:26.548
and you can prepare them,
and you can tell them apart.

00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:29.465
Okay, now here's a problem for
you to do for Monday,

00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:31.980
and you can work in groups if
you want to.

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:37.379
But take -- this is planar and
two-dimensional,

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:38.320
right?
 

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.205
But in truth,
because carbons are

00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:45.264
tetrahedral, when they form four
single bonds,

00:16:45.264 --> 00:16:47.970
the others are not planar.
 

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:48.336
Right?
 

00:16:48.336 --> 00:16:51.693
And I've drawn here how each of
them would look in three

00:16:51.693 --> 00:16:53.625
dimensions,
with some things,

00:16:53.625 --> 00:16:55.779
the wedges, coming out toward
you,

00:16:55.779 --> 00:16:58.336
and other things,
the dotted ones,

00:16:58.336 --> 00:17:00.429
going back into the page.
 

00:17:00.429 --> 00:17:01.308
Right?
 

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:05.528
So if you consider these in
three dimensions,

00:17:05.528 --> 00:17:08.500
how many isomers can you get?
 

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.069
Right? That's the question.
 

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.730
Mono and disubstituted isomers.
 

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.425
Will you be able to distinguish
these, if they're

00:17:15.425 --> 00:17:16.548
three-dimensional?
 

00:17:16.548 --> 00:17:20.030
And -- that one,
remember, is called Dewar

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.067
benzene --
and the one that's not included

00:17:23.067 --> 00:17:26.323
was prismane or what's called
"Ladenburg"

00:17:26.323 --> 00:17:27.038
benzene.
 

00:17:27.038 --> 00:17:28.769
Remember I said we'd talk about
Ladenburg;

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:30.028
he's coming up.
 

00:17:30.028 --> 00:17:34.042
So that's another possibility,
a three-dimensional symmetrical

00:17:34.042 --> 00:17:34.568
prism.
 

00:17:34.568 --> 00:17:34.875
Right?
 

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:37.481
Which obviously Dewar couldn't
make with his models,

00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:40.547
because they would -- unless he
distorted them and bent them,

00:17:40.547 --> 00:17:41.108
right?
 

00:17:41.108 --> 00:17:43.491
Okay, so the question is,
how many mono- and

00:17:43.491 --> 00:17:45.931
disubstituted isomers can you
get from these,

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.759
if they're three-dimensional?
 

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:52.673
So you guys can get together
and talk that over and tell me

00:17:52.673 --> 00:17:53.690
on Monday.
 

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.980
Okay?
 

00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:00.463
Now there's another way to get
-- to infer structure,

00:18:00.463 --> 00:18:02.880
and that's from synthesis.
 

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.865
So Kekulé, in 1867,
reported that three acetone

00:18:06.865 --> 00:18:09.563
molecules,
shown on the left there -- you

00:18:09.563 --> 00:18:13.169
see the C double bond O and the
two methyls attached to each

00:18:13.169 --> 00:18:14.269
central carbon.
 

00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:19.861
So three of those come together
at a, at b,

00:18:19.861 --> 00:18:22.356
at c,
losing water,

00:18:22.356 --> 00:18:27.150
and they form the double bonds
on the right.

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:32.047
So if that's the way the stuff
forms, then the three carbons in

00:18:32.047 --> 00:18:36.944
this compound called mesitylene
should be on every other carbon

00:18:36.944 --> 00:18:38.920
of the ring -- right?
 

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.904
-- because of the way it was
put together by losing waters

00:18:41.904 --> 00:18:42.690
between them.
 

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.154
So that's another way of
figuring out where something is,

00:18:47.154 --> 00:18:48.348
by synthesis.
 

00:18:48.348 --> 00:18:54.416
Notice incidentally that there
are little dots in the middle of

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:56.568
some of these bonds.
 

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:58.630
Why do you think those dots are
there?

00:19:07.368 --> 00:19:11.818
I think it's because this is a
picture of a real model,

00:19:11.818 --> 00:19:14.528
that was made with wire coming
out of balls,

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:20.750
and that was the thing that
screwed them together.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.672
Dewar had sent to
Kekulé,

00:19:22.672 --> 00:19:25.834
when he wanted to come work
with him, a set of these

00:19:25.834 --> 00:19:27.259
brass-strip models.
 

00:19:27.259 --> 00:19:30.490
So this I think is
Kekulé's version,

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.490
from brass-strip models.
 

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.150
Notice the funny bonds between
the carbon and the oxygen,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.858
the double bonds,
those triangles.

00:19:36.858 --> 00:19:40.719
Those are made of stiff wire
that comes straight out and then

00:19:40.719 --> 00:19:43.098
were fastened together at an
angle.

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:43.402
Okay?
 

00:19:43.402 --> 00:19:46.789
Here's a picture actually of
the model that Kekulé

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:49.210
used in his lectures to show
benzene.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:53.859
And you can see that the carbon
is tetrahedral.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:54.599
Okay?
 

00:19:54.599 --> 00:19:55.298
Yes?
 

00:19:55.298 --> 00:19:57.299
Student:  Doesn't the
story go that Kekulé

00:19:57.299 --> 00:19:59.009
also had a dream about a snake
eating itself?

00:19:59.009 --> 00:20:02.220
Prof: Yeah,
that he made up in 1890.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.368
This is long after this.
 

00:20:04.368 --> 00:20:07.502
It's conceivable that he had
such a dream,

00:20:07.502 --> 00:20:10.558
but it was a story told for
amusement.

00:20:10.558 --> 00:20:13.984
Okay, so here he is at the time
he did this, in 1865,

00:20:13.984 --> 00:20:14.710
in Ghent.
 

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:19.308
And he was surrounded with some
hotshots.

00:20:19.308 --> 00:20:22.880
Koerner, for example,
who was a young man.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.992
He acted as Kekulé's
secretary at this time,

00:20:25.992 --> 00:20:29.480
as well as a lab worker,
and suffered from rheumatism.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.083
He came from Central Germany,
which is a very sort of damp

00:20:33.083 --> 00:20:36.369
place a lot of the time,
and cloudy, and so it wasn't

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:39.858
good for his rheumatism;
nor was Ghent in Belgium.

00:20:39.858 --> 00:20:45.740
So, on his doctor's advice,
he went to sunny Palermo in

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:46.720
Sicily.
 

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.710
So Palermo is down there on the
northwest coast of Sicily.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:55.009
And Sicily is a very
interesting place in history.

00:20:55.009 --> 00:20:58.797
It was liberated in 1860,
just before this time,

00:20:58.797 --> 00:21:03.309
after 2700 years of occupation
by successive cultures.

00:21:03.309 --> 00:21:04.900
Okay?
 

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:10.832
And the most recent one was
Garibaldi, who came down with

00:21:10.832 --> 00:21:16.659
his Red Shirts in 1860 to free
Sicily from the Bourbons,

00:21:16.659 --> 00:21:19.519
from the Spanish crown.
 

00:21:19.519 --> 00:21:20.450
Okay?
 

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:26.563
And Cannizzaro came along and
established this laboratory in

00:21:26.563 --> 00:21:27.598
Palermo.
 

00:21:27.598 --> 00:21:32.596
In 1860, he helped both
Garibaldi, and the late

00:21:32.596 --> 00:21:35.529
Avogadro, and Gay-Lussac.
 

00:21:35.529 --> 00:21:38.463
Both of these were
revolutionaries,

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:41.140
although in different senses.
 

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.269
Garibaldi was revolutionary
politically,

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:48.508
and Avogadro was revolutionary
about knowing the atomic weight

00:21:48.508 --> 00:21:52.400
and molecular weight of
compounds through gas density.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:56.048
But in his way,
Cannizzaro was a cautious

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:56.868
person.
 

00:21:56.868 --> 00:22:00.348
This is what he said when he
spoke in London,

00:22:00.348 --> 00:22:02.960
in 1872, on chemistry teaching.
 

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:06.730
He said: "Above all we
should take care that the pupils

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.180
do not form to themselves any
mechanical or geometrical

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.799
conception of the cause and
effects of the

00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:15.994
quantivalence"
(that is, the valence) "of

00:22:15.994 --> 00:22:16.890
atoms.
 

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.935
They must frequently be
reminded that chemical facts

00:22:20.935 --> 00:22:25.380
neither prove not disprove
anything relating to size,

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:28.930
form, continuity,
distance, relative disposition,

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.900
etcetera, etcetera,
of the atoms."

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.173
That is, don't use these
arguments for this purpose of

00:22:34.173 --> 00:22:37.568
finding where things -- where
atoms are in molecules.

00:22:37.568 --> 00:22:41.715
This is just a fancy that will
appeal to students but isn't

00:22:41.715 --> 00:22:42.858
anything real.
 

00:22:42.858 --> 00:22:46.093
This was a very cautious,
conservative point of view,

00:22:46.093 --> 00:22:49.140
but was shared by all the
leaders in chemistry.

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.480
"If we are sometimes
obliged to speak of the relative

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.710
position of atoms in the
molecules,

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.553
and even to give graphic
representation of these

00:22:57.553 --> 00:23:00.058
positions,
we must hasten to remark that

00:23:00.058 --> 00:23:03.259
these figures are nothing but
artifices of the mind,

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:07.548
intended to represent to the
sight that which in reality we

00:23:07.548 --> 00:23:11.838
perceive only through the veil
of transformations."

00:23:11.838 --> 00:23:15.240
(So it's only through reactions
that you try to infer something

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.380
about this; it's not something
real.)

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.698
"But that we do not really
know what it is that corresponds

00:23:20.698 --> 00:23:23.580
to that which we call position,
either in space,

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.788
or in the mutual action of
different portions of

00:23:26.788 --> 00:23:27.880
matter."
 

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.400
But he was one of the leaders,
right?

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.124
The followers,
the students were more --

00:23:33.124 --> 00:23:34.940
didn't take this,
right?

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.410
So Koerner, who had just come
down,

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.798
for his health,
and joined Cannizzaro --

00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:46.288
in 1869 he came down,
or he came down in 1866,

00:23:46.288 --> 00:23:51.407
I think, or seven -- he wrote a
paper called Facts Serving to

00:23:51.407 --> 00:23:56.038
Determine Chemical Position in
Aromatic Substances.

00:23:56.038 --> 00:23:56.434
Right?
 

00:23:56.434 --> 00:24:00.323
So a completely different point
of view from what Cannizzaro

00:24:00.323 --> 00:24:02.960
advocated three years later --
right?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.980
-- to determine position.
 

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.873
Cannizzaro, to be fair to him,
was saying that you have to be

00:24:07.873 --> 00:24:10.670
different in what you teach and
what you do research on.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.586
Teaching should be things you
really know for sure,

00:24:13.586 --> 00:24:17.146
and research should be things
where you're trying to push back

00:24:17.146 --> 00:24:18.140
the frontier.
 

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.140
But anyhow, Koerner wrote in
this paper, in 1869:

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:25.121
"The dogma of the
impossibility of determining the

00:24:25.121 --> 00:24:27.848
atomic constitution of
substances,

00:24:27.848 --> 00:24:31.613
which until recently was
advocated with such fervor by

00:24:31.613 --> 00:24:35.588
the most able chemists,
is beginning to be abandoned

00:24:35.588 --> 00:24:38.540
and forgotten;
and one can predict that the

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:42.357
day is not far in the future
when a sufficient collection of

00:24:42.357 --> 00:24:46.368
facts will permit determination
of the internal architecture of

00:24:46.368 --> 00:24:47.338
molecules.
 

00:24:47.338 --> 00:24:50.402
A series of experiments
directed toward such a goal is

00:24:50.402 --> 00:24:52.308
the object of this paper."
 

00:24:52.308 --> 00:24:52.598
Right?
 

00:24:52.598 --> 00:24:54.338
So that's what he was trying to
do.

00:24:54.338 --> 00:24:58.270
If he came along fifty years
later, what would he have used,

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:01.269
to find the position of atoms
in molecules?

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.200
X-ray, right?
 

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.200
But he's using only reactions
and counting isomers.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:13.588
Right?
 

00:25:13.588 --> 00:25:16.507
So only the properties of
things and elemental

00:25:16.507 --> 00:25:17.480
composition.
 

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.497
Okay, "facts will permit
determination of the internal

00:25:20.497 --> 00:25:21.589
architecture."
 

00:25:21.589 --> 00:25:24.420
So this was a really new idea.
 

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.960
And the paper,
when it was published,

00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.298
was introduced and warmly
endorsed by Cannizzaro,

00:25:31.298 --> 00:25:33.940
who went on to say,
later, that you shouldn't be

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.009
teaching this to students,
but it is a good thing to study.

00:25:37.009 --> 00:25:37.367
Okay?
 

00:25:37.367 --> 00:25:41.526
So Koerner had -- there's a
thing called the Koerner Proof,

00:25:41.526 --> 00:25:43.390
which indeed he proved.
 

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.880
But it's not what he did in
1869.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.210
But this is very interesting.
 

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:50.397
So you have,
among disubstituted isomers,

00:25:50.397 --> 00:25:52.869
you have these possibilities.
 

00:25:52.869 --> 00:25:54.660
Okay?
 

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.309
Now, how could you tell which
is which?

00:25:57.309 --> 00:25:58.700
Suppose you had three bottles.
 

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.483
One is black,
one red, one blue,

00:26:00.483 --> 00:26:03.650
but they're not colored,
they're just white crystals;

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:05.710
or liquids maybe in this case.
 

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:08.450
How could you tell which one is
which?

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.730
How could you put a label on
the bottle?

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.307
Well you could label them just
with names, call them something

00:26:14.307 --> 00:26:17.650
like ortho, meta and para,
which doesn't mean anything.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:19.460
Right?
 

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:25.269
But how do you know what
structure they have?

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:28.650
Cory?
 

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.920
Student:  Differences in
melting point.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.946
Prof: Oh,
differences in melting point

00:26:31.946 --> 00:26:33.328
will show they're different.
 

00:26:33.328 --> 00:26:35.382
But how do you know which one
will have the lowest melting

00:26:35.382 --> 00:26:35.670
point?
 

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.921
You have to have some theory
about melting point as a

00:26:37.921 --> 00:26:40.329
function of structure;
which didn't exist.

00:26:40.329 --> 00:26:41.660
Or do you have such a theory?
 

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.088
Student:  Polarity.
 

00:26:43.088 --> 00:26:44.920
Prof: Polarity.
 

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.828
But notice, to be -- yeah,
one of them would be non-polar.

00:26:49.828 --> 00:26:52.029
But people weren't measuring
polarity at this time.

00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:54.589
So that was out of the question.
 

00:26:54.589 --> 00:26:56.730
Okay, here's how Koerner did it.
 

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.584
He added a third identical
substituent and counted the

00:27:01.584 --> 00:27:02.500
isomers.
 

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.298
So suppose you start with a
black one,

00:27:04.298 --> 00:27:07.278
you add a third one,
down to the right,

00:27:07.278 --> 00:27:11.868
or down at the bottom,
or -- and that's all,

00:27:11.868 --> 00:27:14.810
because if you added down to
the left it would be the same as

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.510
down at the bottom,
and if you added over to the

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.058
left it would be the same as
down to the --

00:27:20.058 --> 00:27:22.400
over to the left would be the
same as down to the right.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.019
Everybody see that?
 

00:27:24.019 --> 00:27:26.259
You can only get two isomers,
starting from there.

00:27:26.259 --> 00:27:30.548
If you start from the red one,
you can get either of those.

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:37.480
Can you get anything else,
from the red one?

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.640
Andrew?
 

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.940
Student: You get another
one on the left.

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:41.310
Prof: Yeah,
down to the left will be a

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:41.808
different one.
 

00:27:41.808 --> 00:27:43.200
So you'll get three from that
one.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.775
And how about if you start with
the blue one and put a third one

00:27:45.775 --> 00:27:45.980
in?
 

00:27:49.589 --> 00:27:51.250
Maria, what do you say?
 

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.848
If you start with the blue one
and put a third blue substituent

00:27:54.848 --> 00:27:55.140
in?
 

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.890
Student:  You have the
one in the middle.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.259
Prof: Speak up a little.
 

00:27:58.259 --> 00:28:01.200
Student:  You have the
one in the middle.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.208
Prof: Right,
you can get the one in the

00:28:04.208 --> 00:28:04.808
middle.
 

00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:07.970
Student:  And everything
else is just --

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:09.118
Prof: Nothing else.
 

00:28:09.118 --> 00:28:09.663
Right?
 

00:28:09.663 --> 00:28:12.200
Only one possibility there.
 

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:12.529
Okay?
 

00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:15.108
So one will give one,
one will give two,

00:28:15.108 --> 00:28:18.025
one will give three;
supposing that all the

00:28:18.025 --> 00:28:19.039
reactions work.
 

00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:20.118
Right?
 

00:28:20.118 --> 00:28:23.465
So it establishes the identity,
not only of the disubstituted,

00:28:23.465 --> 00:28:25.990
but only also of the
trisubstituted isomers.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.005
One comes from one of the
original bottles,

00:28:28.005 --> 00:28:30.259
one comes from two,
and one comes from three.

00:28:30.259 --> 00:28:31.599
So you know it.
 

00:28:31.599 --> 00:28:34.088
Pretty clever.
 

00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:39.685
And these were called -- these
are called now ortho,

00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:41.230
meta and para.
 

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.210
But those aren't the names that
Koerner used.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.432
Or more properly,
they are the names that he

00:28:50.432 --> 00:28:52.769
used, but not to name the way we
do it now.

00:28:52.769 --> 00:28:54.588
If anybody, he had the right to
name them,

00:28:54.588 --> 00:28:57.538
but he didn't get it because he
was off in left-field down in

00:28:57.538 --> 00:28:59.351
Palermo,
and the people up in Germany,

00:28:59.351 --> 00:29:03.588
who were influential,
were the ones that finally

00:29:03.588 --> 00:29:05.078
named them.
 

00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:09.880
But notice that this argument
holds if benzene is a hexagon.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:14.119
But if it were a pentagonal
pyramid, or some other geometric

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:17.930
structure, then this argument
wouldn't work at all.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:18.234
Right?
 

00:29:18.234 --> 00:29:21.387
So you have first to know that
all the positions are equivalent

00:29:21.387 --> 00:29:23.343
in benzene;
that it's not like some of

00:29:23.343 --> 00:29:25.640
those Dewar structures we were
just looking at.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.230
So how can you do that?
 

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.432
This was proven,
in this paper in 1869,

00:29:30.432 --> 00:29:31.528
by Koerner.
 

00:29:31.528 --> 00:29:33.890
The paper was published in
Palermo,

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.050
in the Giornale di Scienze
Naturale ed Economiche di

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.266
Palermo,
which is the Journal of

00:29:39.266 --> 00:29:41.630
Natural Science and Economics of
Palermo.

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:44.951
It's a beautiful big journal
with big wide margins on the

00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:45.960
page and so on.
 

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.930
But it had no circulation
whatever.

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:50.058
People in Germany,
years later,

00:29:50.058 --> 00:29:53.609
were still trying to prove
this, what he proved.

00:29:53.609 --> 00:29:55.298
Okay, now here's a question.
 

00:29:55.298 --> 00:29:58.358
Are the four valences of carbon
equivalent;

00:29:58.358 --> 00:30:02.867
that is, are they all the same
or might one of them be a thick

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:06.118
bond, say, different from the
other three?

00:30:06.118 --> 00:30:06.451
Right?
 

00:30:06.451 --> 00:30:09.670
Or, might it even be that two
of the bonds are different;

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.069
one's long, or one of them's
curly.

00:30:13.069 --> 00:30:15.210
Might all four be different?
 

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:18.712
Can you think of any evidence
to say that the bonds in methane

00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:19.690
are equivalent?
 

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.440
How could you prove this?
 

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:27.789
Alison, you got any idea?
 

00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:30.809
What technique is Koerner using?
 

00:30:30.809 --> 00:30:31.750
Pardon me?
 

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.809
Student:  To see if the
isomers are --

00:30:32.809 --> 00:30:33.990
Prof: Counting isomers.
 

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:36.798
So what do you expect if you
have four different bonds in

00:30:36.798 --> 00:30:37.250
carbon?
 

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.170
Student:  It matters
where you substitute.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:39.787
Prof: Right.
 

00:30:39.787 --> 00:30:41.769
How many isomers would you get
if there were four different?

00:30:41.769 --> 00:30:43.358
Student:  One substitute.
 

00:30:43.358 --> 00:30:45.813
Prof: You could have a
chlorine on the fat bond,

00:30:45.813 --> 00:30:47.721
the long bond,
the curly bond or the normal

00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:49.663
bond;
there'd be four isomers,

00:30:49.663 --> 00:30:53.369
if you could make them all,
and they didn't interconvert.

00:30:53.369 --> 00:30:54.269
Right?
 

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:58.390
So there's only one methyl
chloride.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:00.618
Nobody's found a second methyl
chloride.

00:31:00.618 --> 00:31:06.150
So does that prove that they're
all equivalent?

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.279
Yeah?
 

00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:08.519
Pardon me?
 

00:31:08.519 --> 00:31:09.568
Yeah?
 

00:31:09.568 --> 00:31:10.816
Student:  Not on its
own.

00:31:10.816 --> 00:31:13.308
But they can attach more than
one chlorine to all the bonds.

00:31:13.308 --> 00:31:16.598
So they know that they all sort
of -- they will work.

00:31:16.598 --> 00:31:17.722
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:17.722 --> 00:31:21.344
That doesn't prove it alone,
because maybe there's only one

00:31:21.344 --> 00:31:23.029
that can be substituted.
 

00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.890
Right?
 

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.545
That is, of the one -- if it
had the structure on the right,

00:31:26.545 --> 00:31:29.019
with four different bonds,
maybe you could make only one

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:30.098
monosubstituted one.
 

00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:33.890
How many disubstituted ones
could you make then?

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.430
Student:  The one.
 

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.494
Prof: If the first one
went in one place,

00:31:37.494 --> 00:31:39.210
the second one could go any of
three.

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:42.490
So you'd still say get three
disubstituted.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.200
Unless you could only make one
of those.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.769
Then there would only be two.
 

00:31:46.769 --> 00:31:50.627
So it doesn't really prove it,
the way a mathematician would

00:31:50.627 --> 00:31:53.439
like things proven,
but it's a plausibility,

00:31:53.439 --> 00:31:54.289
at least.
 

00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:55.390
Okay?
 

00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:00.290
But it turns out that -- so the
evidence is there's only one

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.778
isomer known,
but it's not really proof.

00:32:03.778 --> 00:32:06.535
Now Koerner,
in order to make a real proof,

00:32:06.535 --> 00:32:10.273
had to make some assumptions,
and these he stated in 1867,

00:32:10.273 --> 00:32:13.618
two years before the paper
we're talking about.

00:32:13.618 --> 00:32:16.278
And the first is direct
replacement.

00:32:16.278 --> 00:32:18.887
And he wrote:
"If one grants that in

00:32:18.887 --> 00:32:22.865
simple transformation the new
substituent assumes the position

00:32:22.865 --> 00:32:25.670
of the element
displacedâ€¦."

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:28.808
So you can take a substituent
off and put a new one there,

00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:32.170
but it will go in the same
place that the old one came off.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.150
Everything doesn't rearrange.
 

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.519
You need that in order to make
arguments like he wants to make.

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:38.339
Right?
 

00:32:38.339 --> 00:32:40.220
And in fact that's often true.
 

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:42.490
It's certainly logically
parsimonious.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:44.409
It's the simplest assumption
you can make,

00:32:44.409 --> 00:32:45.578
and it usually is true.
 

00:32:45.578 --> 00:32:48.693
But there are rearrangements
that do sometimes occur,

00:32:48.693 --> 00:32:50.970
and we'll talk about those
later on.

00:32:50.970 --> 00:32:54.204
But anyhow, for his argument
you have to assume direct

00:32:54.204 --> 00:32:55.058
replacement.
 

00:32:55.058 --> 00:32:58.189
And the second assumption is
experimental distinguishability,

00:32:58.189 --> 00:32:59.910
which we've been talking about.
 

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.159
"Most of the
demonstrations are based on

00:33:02.159 --> 00:33:05.227
establishing the identity or
difference of several substances

00:33:05.227 --> 00:33:07.882
of the same composition,
but obtained by different

00:33:07.882 --> 00:33:08.680
reactions."
 

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.371
So you have to be confident
that you can tell when things

00:33:11.371 --> 00:33:13.390
are the same and when they're
different.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:14.960
We just were talking about that.
 

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.596
But Koerner was in an
especially good position to do

00:33:17.596 --> 00:33:20.130
this, because he was really
skilled in the lab.

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:24.130
In fact, he got a Silver Medal
at a Paris exposition,

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.028
one of these international
expositions,

00:33:26.028 --> 00:33:29.462
for his collection of beautiful
crystals that he had lovingly

00:33:29.462 --> 00:33:31.259
prepared,
and they had different shapes

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:31.680
and so on.
 

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.788
That's one way you can tell
things apart.

00:33:33.788 --> 00:33:36.211
And, in fact,
this bottle here,

00:33:36.211 --> 00:33:40.568
says up at the top -- I don't
think you can read it.

00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:44.092
But it says,
Laboratorio di Chimica

00:33:44.092 --> 00:33:47.709
Organica,
and it says Acido,

00:33:47.709 --> 00:33:50.279
Ac., Salicilico.
 

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:51.970
So what is it?
 

00:33:51.970 --> 00:33:53.368
Salicylic Acid.
 

00:33:53.368 --> 00:33:57.309
This is Koerner's sample --
right?

00:33:57.309 --> 00:33:58.970
-- of salicylic acid.
 

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:03.269
And here are his beautiful
crystals of

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:06.640
2,6-dinitro-3-bromotoluene.
 

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.429
You can't see them so well here.
 

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:11.329
Well you can see that they're
still beautiful crystals,

00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.760
right?
 

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.909
So those are some of his prize
crystals.

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:19.829
And here you can -- so crystals
are the best way to tell.

00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:23.190
And there are pictures of those
things that were Koerner's.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:27.530
Okay, now here's his proof,
based on those assumptions.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:32.594
Okay, so there are three known
isomers of

00:34:32.594 --> 00:34:35.760
hydroxycarboxylbenzene.
 

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.050
So you don't know anything
about the structure.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:39.429
All you know is you is you have
C_6H_4.

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.974
You originally had C_6H_6,
but one of the H's has been

00:34:42.974 --> 00:34:45.650
replaced by OH,
and another H by COOH.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:48.998
And the names of these things
are salicylic acid,

00:34:48.998 --> 00:34:52.067
which I just showed you,
hydroxybenzoic acid,

00:34:52.067 --> 00:34:54.300
and parahydroxybenzoic acid.
 

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.880
So the names don't mean
anything, but those are just

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.400
what the bottles are called.
 

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.449
Right?
 

00:34:59.449 --> 00:35:03.639
Now, you want to use the
existence of at least three.

00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:07.188
You don't -- there might be
eighteen, for all you know,

00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:08.570
disubstituted ones.
 

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:09.599
Right?
 

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:12.280
But you know there are at least
these three, and you can do

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.389
experiments with them.
 

00:35:13.389 --> 00:35:15.070
So these are the experiments.
 

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:19.108
First you treat it with HCl and
heat it up -- this was done by

00:35:19.108 --> 00:35:21.889
Graebe in 1866 -- and it loses
the COOH.

00:35:21.889 --> 00:35:25.297
Remember, we talked about how
you could take benzoic acid,

00:35:25.297 --> 00:35:27.510
take the COOH off and have
benzene.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:29.278
Here it's done,
take the COOH off,

00:35:29.278 --> 00:35:31.210
but you're left with still the
OH.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.547
And that compound,
as we mentioned before,

00:35:33.547 --> 00:35:34.630
is called phenol.
 

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:35.518
Right?
 

00:35:35.518 --> 00:35:39.516
But you can do the same trick
with parahydroxybenzoic acid,

00:35:39.516 --> 00:35:43.030
and you get the same phenol,
not a different one.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.210
What does that tell you?
 

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.992
It tells you that the
difference between salicylic

00:35:48.992 --> 00:35:53.469
acid and parahydroxybenzoic acid
is not where the OH is.

00:35:53.469 --> 00:35:53.824
Right?
 

00:35:53.824 --> 00:35:57.255
They have to have the same
position of the OH because -- or

00:35:57.255 --> 00:36:00.686
at least equivalent ones --
because you get the same phenol

00:36:00.686 --> 00:36:01.219
out.
 

00:36:01.219 --> 00:36:04.929
And it was found also by Graebe
that you could convert

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:09.199
hydroxybenzoic acid to methyl
anisate -- that's the OH becomes

00:36:09.199 --> 00:36:11.860
OCH_3;
and so same for the acid.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.836
And then you can convert it to
anisic acid, taking the CH_3 off

00:36:15.836 --> 00:36:19.030
on the acid group;
from the ester, that is to say.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:23.896
And you can convert phenol by
way of bromoanisole -- Koerner,

00:36:23.896 --> 00:36:28.114
I believe, did this -- and then
with sodium and CO_2,

00:36:28.114 --> 00:36:30.710
to get the same anisic acid.
 

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:31.510
Right?
 

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:35.945
So the OH position has to be
the same in hydroxybenzoic acid

00:36:35.945 --> 00:36:39.030
as it was in salicylic and
parahydroxy.

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.311
Right?
 

00:36:39.311 --> 00:36:41.663
So the conclusion is the
difference among the three

00:36:41.663 --> 00:36:45.068
isomers that are known --
salicylic, hydroxybenzoic acid,

00:36:45.068 --> 00:36:48.568
parahydroxybenzoic --
is not where the OH is,

00:36:48.568 --> 00:36:52.518
since the O survives in
identical compounds.

00:36:52.518 --> 00:36:55.865
So, for example,
it couldn't be like these three

00:36:55.865 --> 00:36:58.429
isomers of Dewar's structure
here.

00:36:58.429 --> 00:37:01.782
Suppose that were one of the
acids, and that were another

00:37:01.782 --> 00:37:03.639
one, and that were the third.
 

00:37:03.639 --> 00:37:06.889
Then when you took the COOH
off, you'd have three different

00:37:06.889 --> 00:37:07.730
OH compounds.
 

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:09.679
Everybody with me?
 

00:37:09.679 --> 00:37:11.070
You see that?
 

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:12.630
So the difference among these
three,

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.570
whatever it is that makes them
different,

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:18.523
can't be where the OH is,
because you can remove the COOH

00:37:18.523 --> 00:37:20.429
and they're all the same.
 

00:37:20.429 --> 00:37:22.909
Okay, that's the first step.
 

00:37:22.909 --> 00:37:29.070
And the conclusion is the sites
occupied by OH are either

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.039
identical, or equivalent.
 

00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:33.070
Here's what's equivalent.
 

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:34.320
So suppose they could be this.
 

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.909
There's OH, COOH.
 

00:37:35.909 --> 00:37:37.840
See did I? Yeah here.
 

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.501
So you could have that OH,
that OH and that -- no,

00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:44.909
there's;
okay, sorry I'm messing this up.

00:37:44.909 --> 00:37:48.893
There's one,
one, one, two,

00:37:48.893 --> 00:37:50.119
three.
 

00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:52.871
The OHs in those are not the
same position -- one's the top

00:37:52.871 --> 00:37:55.574
right, the other's the top left
-- but they're equivalent,

00:37:55.574 --> 00:37:56.050
right?
 

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:58.231
Once you got it,
you could flop if over and

00:37:58.231 --> 00:38:00.000
they're the same as one another.
 

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.599
Okay, so we know at least that
much.

00:38:03.599 --> 00:38:07.242
So let's call the OH position,
which is either the same or

00:38:07.242 --> 00:38:09.481
exactly equivalent,
call it Ï‰,

00:38:09.481 --> 00:38:10.760
just for a name.
 

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.739
So OH is in the position of
HÏ‰;

00:38:13.739 --> 00:38:16.420
that we know,
in all three compounds.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.090
Can you guess what you do next?
 

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.260
Next -- yeah?
 

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.983
Student:  Probably take
the OH off and leave the COOH

00:38:30.983 --> 00:38:31.300
on.
 

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.463
Prof: Ah!
 

00:38:32.463 --> 00:38:35.079
Take the OH off and leave the
COOH.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:35.659
Right?
 

00:38:35.659 --> 00:38:37.170
And that's possible too.
 

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.550
You can treat it with
phosphorus pentachloride,

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:44.750
which converts OH to Cl,
and then with sodium and water,

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.760
which takes the chlorine off
and leaves hydrogen.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:49.710
So you get benzoic acid.
 

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:53.110
And what do you do next?
 

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.440
Do it to one of the other
compounds, right?

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.289
There, and you get the same
benzoic acid.

00:38:58.289 --> 00:39:01.675
Or you do it here -- and I
think Koerner is the guy who did

00:39:01.675 --> 00:39:04.827
that, although I can't --
haven't found a paper to that

00:39:04.827 --> 00:39:05.469
effect.
 

00:39:05.469 --> 00:39:08.489
But anyhow, he says that you
get the same benzoic acid.

00:39:08.489 --> 00:39:09.099
So what does that prove?
 

00:39:12.909 --> 00:39:16.679
So the COOH positions are not
fundamentally different in the

00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:17.829
three compounds.
 

00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:21.641
So the OH positions are
equivalent, and also the COOH

00:39:21.641 --> 00:39:23.619
positions are equivalent.
 

00:39:23.619 --> 00:39:26.360
How can they then be different,
the three compounds?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.550
Because they're clearly
different.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.750
It must be their relative
positions that are different.

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:33.960
Okay?
 

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.509
The three isomers do not differ
because of the absolute position

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:39.518
of the COOH.
 

00:39:39.518 --> 00:39:45.393
So the three sites of COOH are
equivalent, and we can name them

00:39:45.393 --> 00:39:46.909
x and y and z.
 

00:39:46.909 --> 00:39:48.989
None of them can be exactly the
same,

00:39:48.989 --> 00:39:52.034
because if they were exactly
the same then those

00:39:52.034 --> 00:39:54.844
hydroxybenzoic acids,
two of them at least,

00:39:54.844 --> 00:39:58.090
would've been the same,
if the COOHs -- because we know

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.389
the OHs were the same.
 

00:39:59.389 --> 00:40:00.219
Okay?
 

00:40:00.219 --> 00:40:03.427
So, for example,
it could be this way in Dewar's

00:40:03.427 --> 00:40:04.110
benzene.
 

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:08.023
You could have that position
for x, that for y,

00:40:08.023 --> 00:40:09.130
that for z.
 

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:13.119
And they're all different with
respect to Ï‰.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:16.550
Okay?
 

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.449
The Ï‰'s will all be the
same.

00:40:18.449 --> 00:40:23.190
So that would be a possible
structure, according to this.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:28.224
In this particular case,
Ï‰ would be the same as x,

00:40:28.224 --> 00:40:33.628
y and z, as a site for a single
substituent, if it were this

00:40:33.628 --> 00:40:34.909
structure.
 

00:40:34.909 --> 00:40:38.661
So Arppe, a chemist,
had made a compound which he

00:40:38.661 --> 00:40:42.927
called nitroaniline,
which was benzene that had NH_2

00:40:42.927 --> 00:40:45.291
and NO_2 in it,
and it was known by

00:40:45.291 --> 00:40:49.820
transformations,
that the NH_2 was Ï‰,

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.798
that position OHÏ‰,
and the NO_2_ was in

00:40:52.798 --> 00:40:55.079
y;
that is, you could interconvert

00:40:55.079 --> 00:40:58.800
groups and make it into one of
those known hydroxybenzoic

00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.400
acids.
 

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.949
So you knew it was Ï‰
and y.

00:41:01.949 --> 00:41:03.349
Okay?
 

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:08.514
Now, you do a transfer -- and
it's related to that particular

00:41:08.514 --> 00:41:10.409
hydroxybenzoic acid.
 

00:41:10.409 --> 00:41:11.900
Okay?
 

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.398
Now, you replace the NH_2 by Br
-- and we'll talk about these

00:41:15.398 --> 00:41:18.144
next semester,
what particular reactions did

00:41:18.144 --> 00:41:21.472
that --
and then you change NO_2 to

00:41:21.472 --> 00:41:26.630
NH_2, and then you replace the
NH_2 by chlorine.

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:29.679
So now you've got benzene with
bromine;

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:33.070
that must be in the Ï‰
position, because it replaced

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:34.099
the first NH_2.
 

00:41:34.099 --> 00:41:38.059
And then chlorine is in y
because it substituted for the

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:42.090
second NH_2, which came from the
NO_2, which was in y.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.280
Okay?
 

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.050
So it's Ï‰ and y.
 

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:47.130
Can you see what he's going to
do next?

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.403
He replaces the NH_2 by Cl,
and then changes NO_2 to NH_2,

00:42:00.403 --> 00:42:02.949
and then replaces it by Br.
 

00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:04.150
Why?
 

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.891
So now he's prepared a compound
which clearly has chlorine in

00:42:10.891 --> 00:42:13.590
the position Ï‰
and bromine in position y.

00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:21.449
I see pursing of brows and so
on.

00:42:21.449 --> 00:42:22.170
Is everybody clear?
 

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:26.351
So he's prepared two -- from
the same compound he's prepared

00:42:26.351 --> 00:42:27.840
a bromide chloride.
 

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.539
Right?
 

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:31.867
One of them is Ï‰
bromide y chloride,

00:42:31.867 --> 00:42:34.710
and the other has them
exchanged.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.039
And what do you think he
observed?

00:42:37.039 --> 00:42:38.530
They're the same.
 

00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:43.880
What does that show?
 

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.690
Student: 
&gt;.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.360
Prof: It shows that
Ï‰ is the same as y,

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.445
because otherwise these would
be different when you put

00:42:51.445 --> 00:42:53.768
different atoms in them;
assuming you have the

00:42:53.768 --> 00:42:57.409
experimental technique to tell
when things are different.

00:42:57.409 --> 00:42:58.130
Okay?
 

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.400
So now -- so it couldn't be,
for example,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.309
a pentagonal pyramid,
which one had bromine in y,

00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:08.050
and the other had chlorine --
chlorine in y,

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.289
the other had chlorine and
Ï‰ and bromine in y.

00:43:10.289 --> 00:43:13.019
It couldn't be that,
those would be different.

00:43:13.019 --> 00:43:14.768
Okay?
 

00:43:14.768 --> 00:43:20.036
So there must be at least four
equivalent substituted

00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:23.380
positions: Ï‰,
y, x and z.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:23.949
Okay?
 

00:43:23.949 --> 00:43:27.579
And that would be consistent
with that structure we showed

00:43:27.579 --> 00:43:28.789
before, this one.
 

00:43:28.789 --> 00:43:30.920
So it could be that.
 

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.599
It doesn't have to be a hexagon.
 

00:43:34.599 --> 00:43:36.420
Now, here's the next step.
 

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:40.219
So you start with a compound
that's known to be in the meta

00:43:40.219 --> 00:43:40.809
series.
 

00:43:40.809 --> 00:43:46.293
It's got OH in Ï‰,
and nitro, NO_2 -- he wrote

00:43:46.293 --> 00:43:48.050
AzO_2 -- in x.
 

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:52.271
And you have another one that
has again OH in the position

00:43:52.271 --> 00:43:55.679
Ï‰, but bromine in x,
instead of nitro.

00:43:55.679 --> 00:43:59.110
And now you start doing
substitutions.

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:00.775
Remember, he used
"meta"

00:44:00.775 --> 00:44:02.440
differently from the way we do.
 

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.016
Okay, so first he put in a
bromine someplace,

00:44:06.016 --> 00:44:08.780
and then a nitro someplace,
and got

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.219
bromonitrometanitrophenol.
 

00:44:11.219 --> 00:44:13.050
Okay, he added a bromo and a
nitro group.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.954
So you know that's the benzene
core, with H_2,

00:44:15.954 --> 00:44:19.119
with a nitro someplace,
with a bromo someplace.

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:20.829
Those are the ones you just put
in.

00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:23.420
But the others are still where
they were.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:28.889
OH is in Ï‰
and nitro is in x position.

00:44:28.889 --> 00:44:32.860
And now you go to the other
compound and put in two nitro

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.500
groups.
 

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:36.971
So you don't know where those
two nitro groups are,

00:44:36.971 --> 00:44:40.233
but you know Ï‰
's -- that OH is in Ï‰

00:44:40.233 --> 00:44:41.900
and bromine is in x.
 

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.590
Everybody see what you've done
now?

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:48.260
And you know what he observed?
 

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:51.730
Those two compounds are
identical.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.590
Can you see what conclusion you
get from that?

00:44:58.349 --> 00:45:01.409
These are identical, right?
 

00:45:01.409 --> 00:45:07.039
But one of them has bromine in
x, and the other has nitro in x.

00:45:07.039 --> 00:45:08.000
How can they be identical?
 

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.112
There must be a second x
position that's -- there must be

00:45:17.112 --> 00:45:20.030
two positions that are
equivalent, right?

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:23.617
Now, could any of those
positions be ones we already

00:45:23.617 --> 00:45:24.110
know?
 

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:27.369
Could it be Ï‰?
 

00:45:27.369 --> 00:45:30.695
We already know Ï‰,
x, y and z are the same,

00:45:30.695 --> 00:45:31.250
right?
 

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:34.949
Could this new x be one of
those?

00:45:34.949 --> 00:45:36.768
Could it be Ï‰?
 

00:45:36.768 --> 00:45:40.260
No, because we already got
Ï‰, so it can't be Ï‰.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:43.320
Could it be y or z?
 

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:46.036
No, because those would've
started from a different

00:45:46.036 --> 00:45:48.699
compound in the first place,
if it were y or z.

00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:49.125
Right?
 

00:45:49.125 --> 00:45:51.110
You know that this is in x.
 

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:52.489
It's not y, not z.
 

00:45:52.489 --> 00:45:53.070
Right?
 

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:56.550
So there must be a second x,
right?

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.630
We'll call it x'.
 

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:02.280
There must be two positions,
x and x'.

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.079
They're not equivalent to x,
or y.

00:46:05.079 --> 00:46:10.030
They're not the same as x or y
or z or Ï‰.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.230
It's a new one.
 

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.750
Okay?
 

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:15.550
So that's what they are.
 

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:19.090
So there must be at least five
equivalent positions.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:23.920
Now that would be consistent
with that pentagonal pyramid,

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.599
right?
 

00:46:24.599 --> 00:46:27.456
All the five around the base of
it are at five equivalent

00:46:27.456 --> 00:46:28.070
positions.
 

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:33.782
But you can't get three
different disubstituted ones

00:46:33.782 --> 00:46:36.469
among those positions.
 

00:46:36.469 --> 00:46:39.889
Right? So it couldn't be that.
 

00:46:39.889 --> 00:46:43.068
So none of Dewar's models work
with this, although the perfect

00:46:43.068 --> 00:46:44.949
hexagon will work;
a perfect one,

00:46:44.949 --> 00:46:47.409
not alternating single and
double bonds.

00:46:47.409 --> 00:46:51.856
And the equilateral triangular
prism, the Ladenburg benzene

00:46:51.856 --> 00:46:53.159
will also work.
 

00:46:53.159 --> 00:46:55.902
So as I said,
it would work with either of

00:46:55.902 --> 00:46:59.981
those, except that the one on
the right doesn't give the right

00:46:59.981 --> 00:47:02.389
number of disubstituted isomers.
 

00:47:02.389 --> 00:47:04.818
Now Koerner's own argument,
that the sixth position is

00:47:04.818 --> 00:47:07.416
equivalent,
was faulty, because it hinged,

00:47:07.416 --> 00:47:10.664
in a subtle way,
on assuming that the benzene

00:47:10.664 --> 00:47:13.630
was hexagonal before you proved
it was.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:15.733
It wasn't obvious,
but it's true if you look at it

00:47:15.733 --> 00:47:16.250
carefully.
 

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:18.641
But it is possible,
using group theory,

00:47:18.641 --> 00:47:22.041
to construct a logically
rigorous argument on the basis

00:47:22.041 --> 00:47:23.300
of his evidence.
 

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.601
His last step of his argument
was wrong but his evidence was

00:47:26.601 --> 00:47:27.889
adequate to prove it.
 

00:47:27.889 --> 00:47:30.443
So he was right in his
intuition that this proved it,

00:47:30.443 --> 00:47:32.704
and he was right in his
conclusion that all the

00:47:32.704 --> 00:47:34.130
positions are equivalent.
 

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:37.715
So he deserves enormous credit
for formulating the logic of the

00:47:37.715 --> 00:47:40.827
first true structural proof;
not just one of these

00:47:40.827 --> 00:47:43.516
plausibility things,
like there's only one

00:47:43.516 --> 00:47:46.141
monosubstituted methane --
chloromethane,

00:47:46.141 --> 00:47:49.289
therefore all the positions are
equivalent.

00:47:49.289 --> 00:47:50.849
Right? That's just plausibility.
 

00:47:50.849 --> 00:47:54.510
But this is a real rigorous
proof.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:48:02.090
Now how many isomers do you
think there are of C_2H_4Br_2?

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:02.989
Think about it.
 

00:48:02.989 --> 00:48:06.260
Ethane with two bromines,
how many isomers?

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.980
Student:  Two.
 

00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:10.014
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:48:10.014 --> 00:48:11.429
Somebody guess.
 

00:48:11.429 --> 00:48:13.079
Student:  Two.
 

00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:14.199
Prof: John?
 

00:48:14.199 --> 00:48:15.170
Student:  Three.
 

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:17.400
Prof: And how would you
get three?

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:21.380
Student:  Because
there's a double bond on the --

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.059
Prof: No double bond.
 

00:48:23.059 --> 00:48:24.300
There's six things on it.
 

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.230
So forget that one.
 

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.922
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:48:25.922 --> 00:48:27.500
If it were a double bond you'd
be right.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:29.570
But there are no double bonds.
 

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:30.449
Corey?
 

00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:31.389
Student:  Two.
 

00:48:31.389 --> 00:48:33.159
Prof: And what would you
call them?

00:48:33.159 --> 00:48:35.360
How would you distinguish them,
or describe them?

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.809
Student:  One would have
one bromine on each carbon and

00:48:38.809 --> 00:48:41.300
one would have two bromines on
one carbon.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:42.193
Prof: Good.
 

00:48:42.193 --> 00:48:45.224
So you could have two bromines
on one carbon or one bromine on

00:48:45.224 --> 00:48:45.969
each carbon.
 

00:48:45.969 --> 00:48:47.699
So there should be two isomers.
 

00:48:47.699 --> 00:48:50.556
Now, in that same journal,
the same volume of the same

00:48:50.556 --> 00:48:52.797
journal,
in 1869, in Palermo,

00:48:52.797 --> 00:48:56.996
a guy named Paternó
said the three isomers of

00:48:56.996 --> 00:49:00.304
dibromoethane,
supposing they actually exist,

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:03.954
can easily be explained without
assuming any difference among

00:49:03.954 --> 00:49:05.840
the four valences of carbon.
 

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.429
You don't need curly bonds,
long bonds and stuff like that.

00:49:09.429 --> 00:49:12.489
And here's how he explained it,
with this picture.

00:49:12.489 --> 00:49:12.925
Right?
 

00:49:12.925 --> 00:49:17.059
So both, on the leftmost they
have two on the same atom.

00:49:17.059 --> 00:49:19.690
The other two have one on each
atom.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.451
And how are they different --
one on each carbon atom -- but

00:49:23.451 --> 00:49:24.789
how do they differ?
 

00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:29.340
In the phase of rotation,
around the carbon-carbon single

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:29.909
bond.
 

00:49:29.909 --> 00:49:30.929
Right?
 

00:49:30.929 --> 00:49:35.132
And at the bottom he says -- or
actually notice there's a little

00:49:35.132 --> 00:49:37.000
black thing in the middle.
 

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.989
What do you think it is?
 

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:44.639
Dana, what do you think?
 

00:49:44.639 --> 00:49:46.380
Student:  Some way to
join the --

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.239
Prof: Right,
it's a case of rubber tubing.

00:49:48.239 --> 00:49:51.760
Because this is an artist's
picture of an actual model made

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.340
out of sticks and balls.
 

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.510
Right?
 

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:57.750
And sure, those things aren't
super-imposable.

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:58.570
Right?
 

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:02.567
But he says at the bottom:
"It is superfluous to say

00:50:02.567 --> 00:50:06.349
that this is only a way of
representing the facts,

00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:08.789
and that all these ideas need
to be tested

00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:10.159
experimentally."
 

00:50:10.159 --> 00:50:14.469
So we'll see next time what
kind of reception this received.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.590
Prof: Right.
 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.045
Well, we'd better get started
because there's quite a lot of

00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:07.500
ground to cover today as you
will see from the handouts.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.018
Okay.
 

00:00:08.018 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, we all know that Henry
VIII had six queens:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.529
divorced, beheaded,
died, divorced,

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.020
beheaded, survived.
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.665
And that makes good television,
and bad television too,

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;
 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.492
and all of those queens are
marked on your handouts in the

00:00:30.492 --> 00:00:34.540
appropriate place in bold Q1 to
Q6,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.604
but the real reason that his
reign was so important in

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:42.976
English history is of course
that he initiated the English

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:46.779
reformation,
a momentous change with very

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.190
far-reaching consequences.
 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.661
And Henry's interesting marital
career was essentially part of

00:00:55.661 --> 00:01:00.859
that larger process,
set in train by the will of a

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.770
powerful king.
 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.662
Well, for that reason the
English reformation was once

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:12.647
famously described as being
essentially "an act of

00:01:12.647 --> 00:01:18.278
state," its essence being
the transfer of legal authority

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:23.540
over the church in England from
a distant papacy to a very

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.310
present English crown.
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.822
The universal Catholic Church
in England became the Anglican

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:36.370
Church of England.
 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.455
So an act of state,
and an act of state it

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.050
certainly was.
 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.928
It was initiated by the crown
and directed from above and

00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:49.459
carried through by successive
acts of Parliament.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:53.096
And yet it was also,
of course, so much more than

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:57.644
that because these acts of state
also inaugurated fundamental

00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:01.510
changes in the religious culture
of the nation.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.822
Looking at the whole,
it's certainly possible to

00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:07.974
distinguish,
as Christopher Haigh does,

00:02:07.974 --> 00:02:11.120
a series of legislative
reformations,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.158
on the one hand,
and to distinguish that from,

00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:17.552
on the other hand,
what he terms the Protestant

00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:20.968
reformation,
which was a much more gradual

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:25.985
and much more diffuse process of
religious change extending over

00:02:25.985 --> 00:02:27.180
generations.
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.680
And yet the two dimensions of
the reformation,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.680
the legislative and the
Protestant, inevitably went

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.979
together.
 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:43.336
What was once seen as being a
very purposeful process of

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:46.110
change--
carefully directed,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.467
swiftly accomplished--
now tends to be seen as a much

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:53.300
more hesitant and uncertain
business,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.038
but to call the whole thing,
as Christopher Haigh,

00:02:57.038 --> 00:03:00.253
does "a series of
blundering steps"

00:03:00.253 --> 00:03:03.030
is perhaps to go a wee bit too
far,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.217
because there certainly was
purposeful action and the

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:12.127
reformation process became much
more deliberative over time as

00:03:12.127 --> 00:03:16.556
the issues gradually became
clearer and as the religious

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:21.550
alignments to which it gave rise
gradually crystallized.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.812
Christopher Haigh's account of
it all provides us with an

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:29.466
excellent overview,
the details of which take the

00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:31.370
narrative up to 1603.
 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.812
But what I want to do in the
lecture today is to emphasize

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:42.543
the contributions of each phase
of development in the crucial

00:03:42.543 --> 00:03:47.508
generation from the late 1520s
through to 1558--

00:03:47.508 --> 00:03:50.752
the various stages which
contributed to an emerging

00:03:50.752 --> 00:03:55.113
religious division--
and I want to try to bring out

00:03:55.113 --> 00:03:59.220
the logic of those phases of
development.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.342
All of this can be very
confusing in the details,

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:04.750
but there is a certain logic to
it.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.814
And that means in the first
instance grasping how successive

00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:15.138
political situations gave rise
to particular developments which

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:18.829
had consequences for religious
change,

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.180
one way or the other,
and then later on in section

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.146
discussion we'll explore further
the larger question of the

00:04:26.146 --> 00:04:30.110
extent to which these changes
were welcome or unwelcome for

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.940
the people at large and the very
gradual process of their

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.240
acceptance.
 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.654
So let's look at the first
phase which ran roughly from

00:04:41.654 --> 00:04:46.642
1527 to 1531,
which we can call a gathering

00:04:46.642 --> 00:04:47.949
crisis.
 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:53.170
Well, if there was a phase of
blundering about,

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.050
as Christopher Haigh puts it,
then it came at the beginning,

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.189
and it was occasioned of course
by the fact that the King and

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.641
his advisers were facing a
completely unprecedented

00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:07.160
situation in 1527.
 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.750
Henry needed a male heir,
as you know.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.471
The future of the Tudor dynasty
and of the political stability

00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:20.726
which it had reestablished might
hang on that fact of an

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:22.740
undisputed succession.
 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.220
Henry was thirty-six.
 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.120
His wife, Katherine,
was in her early forties.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.470
No child was now likely.
 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.521
Now, as you know,
Katherine had originally come

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:37.970
to England as the bride of
Henry's older brother,

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.184
Arthur, who had shortly died
and she had subsequently married

00:05:43.184 --> 00:05:43.879
Henry.
 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.564
Brooding on this,
Henry by 1527 became

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:51.149
preoccupied with a biblical
text,

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:55.732
Leviticus 20:21,
which translates as "if a

00:05:55.732 --> 00:06:01.610
man shall take his brother's
wife it is an unclean thing.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.463
He hath uncovered his brother's
nakedness and they shall be

00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:07.970
childless."
 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:11.675
And at the same time,
on a somewhat less principled

00:06:11.675 --> 00:06:13.754
note,
Henry's eye had been caught by

00:06:13.754 --> 00:06:16.634
a young woman of the court,
Anne Boleyn,

00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:21.209
whom he saw as a potential new
queen.

00:06:21.209 --> 00:06:25.899
She was in her early twenties,
vivacious, ambitious and

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:31.110
astute, and she was not willing
to be the king's mistress;

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.430
she intended to be queen.
 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.750
So Henry needed to get his
existing marriage dissolved.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.380
He needed it to be declared
void from the beginning by the

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.062
Pope and to take a new queen,
and it should have been very

00:06:46.062 --> 00:06:49.464
easy since popes were usually
willing to cooperate with the

00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:51.459
needs of kings in such matters.
 

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:54.860
But it was rendered difficult
by two factors.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.526
First of all,
Katherine was a very strong

00:06:58.526 --> 00:06:59.810
personality.
 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.384
Her sense of honor was outraged
by the idea that her marriage

00:07:03.384 --> 00:07:08.711
should be dissolved in this way,
and in 1527 as matters began to

00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:13.427
reach a head her nephew,
the Emperor Charles V of the

00:07:13.427 --> 00:07:17.951
Holy Roman Empire of Germany,
gained control of the Pope,

00:07:17.951 --> 00:07:22.098
Clement VII,
in the course of his Italian

00:07:22.098 --> 00:07:22.730
wars.
 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.512
Now all Henry really needed was
a delegation of authority from

00:07:27.512 --> 00:07:32.531
Rome to settle the matter and in
1628 it looked like he might get

00:07:32.531 --> 00:07:33.079
it.
 

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:37.180
In that year a papal
ambassador, Cardinal Campeggio,

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.812
was sent to England and he and
Cardinal Thomas Wolsey were

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:44.829
empowered to establish the facts
regarding Henry's marriage,

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:49.211
but in hearings that they
inaugurated in 1529 Queen

00:07:49.211 --> 00:07:54.560
Katherine vigorously defended
the validity of her marriage.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.072
She denied that there had been
any sexual consummation to

00:07:58.072 --> 00:08:00.519
Prince Arthur,
Henry's older brother.

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.773
She embarrassed the King by
publicly declaring that he knew

00:08:03.773 --> 00:08:06.129
she had been a virgin when they
married.

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:11.550
She defended her honor and her
marriage.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.074
And then in July 1529 new
victories of the Emperor in

00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:21.120
Italy meant the Pope was even
more firmly under his control

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.209
and the Pope revoked the case
back to Rome.

00:08:25.209 --> 00:08:29.591
So the first phase of the
developing crisis was efforts to

00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:34.049
put pressure on the papacy by
threatening the privileges of

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.970
the church in England in order
to get the Pope to cooperate.

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.950
In September 1529,
Cardinal Wolsey,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.158
who had clearly failed Henry,
was threatened with the legal

00:08:47.158 --> 00:08:50.551
charge of praemunire,
which was an offense

00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:54.089
established by statutes in the
fourteenth century regarding the

00:08:54.089 --> 00:08:57.000
jurisdiction of church and state
within England.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.888
He had allegedly illegally
exercised his powers as the

00:09:00.888 --> 00:09:02.870
pope's legate in England.
 

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.808
And a couple of months later
Parliament was called and the

00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:12.660
members of Parliament were
encouraged by royal counselors

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.687
to lay complaints not only
against Cardinal Wolsey but also

00:09:17.687 --> 00:09:22.278
against other alleged abuses in
church affairs.

00:09:22.278 --> 00:09:26.220
So, at this stage Henry is
blustering,

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.852
he was deliberately stoking up
the latent resentment of

00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:33.418
clerical privileges amongst
members of Parliament,

00:09:33.418 --> 00:09:38.808
but as yet there was no
intention to go further.

00:09:38.808 --> 00:09:41.450
Indeed, having set things going
in this manner,

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.418
fired his warning shots as it
were,

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:50.658
the King sent Parliament into
recess between December of 1529

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:55.062
and January of 1531,
and in the meantime he

00:09:55.062 --> 00:10:00.182
assembled a think tank of
academics and clergy to prepare

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:03.110
his legal case for a divorce.
 

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:07.600
And he began consulting learned
opinion amongst lawyers and

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.860
theologians from Europe's
various major universities.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:18.600
But none of this had the
desired effect and in 1530 the

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:25.591
Pope cited Henry to appear
before him in Rome and forbade

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:29.960
him to remarry until he did so.
 

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:35.620
The King was both frustrated
and furious,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.229
and he found reasons to fail to
comply with the Pope's

00:10:39.229 --> 00:10:43.178
requirements in the materials
which were being assembled by

00:10:43.178 --> 00:10:45.288
his academic research team.
 

00:10:45.288 --> 00:10:49.647
These survive and they're known
as the Collecteana and

00:10:49.647 --> 00:10:52.480
they included some crucial
arguments.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.657
One was the argument that
historically the church in

00:10:56.657 --> 00:11:01.080
England had exercised
independent provincial rights.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.835
That's to say it had the right
to autonomy in the settlement of

00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:09.899
certain internal affairs without
reference to Rome.

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:13.940
The second crucial argument,
which they put forward,

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:20.340
was that within England the
king enjoyed imperial power,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.509
not only over the state but
over the church in matters which

00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:29.190
were not of a strictly spiritual
nature.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:34.086
So Henry, still hoping for a
change in the European political

00:11:34.086 --> 00:11:38.250
situation which would lead to
papal cooperation,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:42.129
used these ideas to put a bit
more pressure on the church.

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:48.014
In 1530, his lawyers indicted
the entire clergy in England for

00:11:48.014 --> 00:11:52.452
praemunire,
illegally acquiescing in the

00:11:52.452 --> 00:11:55.538
exercise of papal authority.
 

00:11:55.538 --> 00:11:59.681
The convocation of the church,
meeting in Canterbury,

00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:04.298
resisted and Henry demanded
that they recognize his supreme

00:12:04.298 --> 00:12:06.450
headship of the church.
 

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.730
And they eventually did so.
 

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:15.123
They recognized his authority
but only "so far as the law

00:12:15.123 --> 00:12:18.658
of God allows,"
a saving clause,

00:12:18.658 --> 00:12:23.894
and they gave the King a grant
of 120,000 pounds from the

00:12:23.894 --> 00:12:27.259
church to try to sweeten his
mood.

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:30.970
So where are we in 1531?
 

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.807
The King and the church have
fallen out badly over Henry's

00:12:34.807 --> 00:12:37.570
need for a dissolution of his
marriage.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.658
The central issue has been
clarified.

00:12:40.658 --> 00:12:44.749
The central issue has become
that of legal jurisdiction of

00:12:44.749 --> 00:12:48.980
the papacy over the English
church and therefore its ability

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:53.212
to frustrate his divorce since
the church had authority over

00:12:53.212 --> 00:12:54.288
marriage.
 

00:12:54.288 --> 00:12:59.034
But there was no question of
any doctrinal challenge to the

00:12:59.034 --> 00:13:02.961
Roman Catholic Church,
no challenge in matters of

00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:05.580
faith or matters of worship.
 

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:12.711
This is a legal issue at this
point: which brings us to phase

00:13:12.711 --> 00:13:15.918
two, the Royal Supremacy.
 

00:13:15.918 --> 00:13:20.182
As 1531 advanced,
there was no indication that

00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:25.393
the Pope was going to give way
and the political impasse

00:13:25.393 --> 00:13:30.129
precipitated the second phase of
development,

00:13:30.129 --> 00:13:35.504
the royal supremacy,
and it was masterminded by

00:13:35.504 --> 00:13:40.178
Thomas Cromwell between 1532 and
1535.

00:13:40.178 --> 00:13:42.178
Now a brief word on Thomas
Cromwell.

00:13:42.178 --> 00:13:46.110
He was a man of very humble
origins, the son of a London

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.470
cloth worker and tavern keeper.
 

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.590
He had had an obscure early
career.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.499
He'd probably served as a
soldier in Germany,

00:13:54.499 --> 00:13:58.399
he had worked as a merchant,
and eventually he went into the

00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:58.928
law.
 

00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:02.297
In the 1520s,
he gradually emerged as a very

00:14:02.297 --> 00:14:07.308
skillful man of business in the
household of Cardinal Wolsey,

00:14:07.308 --> 00:14:11.528
much trusted by Wolsey for his
astuteness and competence.

00:14:11.528 --> 00:14:16.118
And in 1530 when Wolsey fell
such was Cromwell's reputation

00:14:16.118 --> 00:14:20.548
that he was taken into the
King's service and by 1530 was

00:14:20.548 --> 00:14:23.158
made a member of the council.
 

00:14:23.158 --> 00:14:28.400
And it was Cromwell who saw the
way out of the legal impasse

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.110
through a carefully planned
program of legislation.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.038
He knew exactly what he was
doing.

00:14:35.038 --> 00:14:39.817
Memoranda in his own hand
survive which show the stages of

00:14:39.817 --> 00:14:43.601
his planning,
and in 1532 to '34 his strategy

00:14:43.601 --> 00:14:47.932
of making Henry's divorce
possible and then legitimizing

00:14:47.932 --> 00:14:52.657
these changes was executed stage
by stage through the careful

00:14:52.657 --> 00:14:56.673
presentation of the King's
desires to Parliament and

00:14:56.673 --> 00:15:00.690
management of Parliament to get
them passed.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:04.323
First of all,
they put still more pressure on

00:15:04.323 --> 00:15:08.620
the church to break any
resistance within England.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.620
Parliament was brought to pass
the Act in Restraint of Annates.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:16.524
Annates were payments to Rome
which were made when bishops

00:15:16.524 --> 00:15:17.690
were appointed.
 

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:21.115
This canceled them,
but the Act was held in

00:15:21.115 --> 00:15:24.538
suspension as a threat to papal
finance.

00:15:24.538 --> 00:15:28.442
Secondly, the House of Commons
put forward what was called its

00:15:28.442 --> 00:15:30.940
Supplication Against the
Ordinaries,

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.400
a petition against the exercise
of ecclesiastical jurisdiction

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.861
in the church courts in England
and the abuses which allegedly

00:15:39.861 --> 00:15:40.960
took place.
 

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:45.217
This was an attack which
provoked the convocation of the

00:15:45.217 --> 00:15:49.399
church, its own assembly,
to reject the accusations.

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:54.472
Henry then rounded angrily on
them and demanded their full

00:15:54.472 --> 00:15:58.389
submission, and in May 1532 they
caved in.

00:15:58.389 --> 00:16:04.378
The convocation submitted and
abandoned its claim to legal

00:16:04.378 --> 00:16:07.528
jurisdictional independence.
 

00:16:07.528 --> 00:16:12.317
The way was now clear in
England, but there was still no

00:16:12.317 --> 00:16:16.408
response from Rome and then fate
lent a hand.

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:21.519
In August 1532,
the Archbishop of Canterbury,

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:24.538
Archbishop Warham,
died.

00:16:24.538 --> 00:16:29.049
Henry and Cromwell managed to
secure the appointment and the

00:16:29.049 --> 00:16:33.942
confirmation from Rome of Thomas
Cranmer as the new Archbishop of

00:16:33.942 --> 00:16:35.090
Canterbury.
 

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.398
Now Cranmer was a Cambridge
academic who had taken a great

00:16:38.398 --> 00:16:41.417
interest in the early
development of Protestantism in

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:42.230
the 1520s.
 

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.105
Henry and Cromwell knew him as
one of the King's think tank and

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:51.745
they knew that he was willing to
do Henry's bidding over the

00:16:51.745 --> 00:16:52.690
divorce.
 

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:56.626
With that confidence,
an Archbishop of Canterbury who

00:16:56.626 --> 00:17:00.791
would do the King's will,
Anne Boleyn at last gave in to

00:17:00.791 --> 00:17:02.759
Henry's importunities.
 

00:17:02.759 --> 00:17:09.489
By December 1532 she was known
to be pregnant and in January of

00:17:09.489 --> 00:17:13.180
1533 they were secretly married.
 

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.240
The King was willing to go
ahead and do that because he was

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.037
convinced that his first
marriage would be declared to

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:20.038
have been void.
 

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:25.660
But now with Anne pregnant
things had to move fast.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:29.692
In April of 1533,
Parliament was brought to pass

00:17:29.692 --> 00:17:34.240
the Act in Restraint of Appeals,
a crucial statute.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.368
This declared that England was
an imperial monarchy,

00:17:37.368 --> 00:17:41.650
no foreign jurisdiction was
valid within its boundaries,

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:46.867
no appeals against a judicial
decision made in England could

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:49.608
be taken outside the kingdom.
 

00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:54.843
And accordingly in May of 1533
Cranmer assembled a court,

00:17:54.843 --> 00:17:59.608
annulled Henry's marriage to
Katherine of Aragon.

00:17:59.608 --> 00:18:04.741
And in June 1533,
Anne, already secretly married

00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:08.199
to the King,
was crowned as queen,

00:18:08.199 --> 00:18:13.223
already six months pregnant
with the future Queen Elizabeth

00:18:13.223 --> 00:18:17.210
I who was born on the seventh of
September.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.558
And in the same month,
September 1533,

00:18:20.558 --> 00:18:25.078
the Pope responded by
excommunicating the King,

00:18:25.078 --> 00:18:31.390
casting him out of the church,
but he held the excommunication

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.769
in suspension in case Henry
would begin to behave.

00:18:36.769 --> 00:18:38.640
But Henry didn't behave.
 

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.755
That wasn't his way.
 

00:18:39.755 --> 00:18:41.150
&gt;
 

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:44.845
In 1534, Parliament passed the
Succession Act declaring the

00:18:44.845 --> 00:18:48.159
validity of the annulment of
Henry's marriage and his

00:18:48.159 --> 00:18:51.663
remarriage and fixing the
succession to the crown in the

00:18:51.663 --> 00:18:52.618
new line.
 

00:18:52.618 --> 00:18:56.266
Oaths were required from all
major office holders to respect

00:18:56.266 --> 00:18:57.750
the Act of Succession.
 

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:02.942
An Act for Submission of the
Clergy was passed to legally

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:07.949
enshrine the clergy's submission
and finally the Act of

00:19:07.949 --> 00:19:12.758
Supremacy,
which declared Henry VIII to be

00:19:12.758 --> 00:19:17.500
the Supreme Head of the Church
of England.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:21.622
In sum then,
the necessity of securing the

00:19:21.622 --> 00:19:28.359
Tudor dynasty had led to England
entering into a state of schism.

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:31.500
Schism.
 

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.936
They had rejected the
jurisdictional authority of

00:19:34.936 --> 00:19:37.840
Rome,
they had asserted the royal

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.210
supremacy over the church,
and in 1534 to '5 this was

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:46.336
backed up with a flurry of
executions of individuals who

00:19:46.336 --> 00:19:50.463
dared to defend the Aragon
marriage and the authority of

00:19:50.463 --> 00:19:53.387
the pope,
and those who were executed

00:19:53.387 --> 00:19:56.196
included John Fisher,
the reforming Bishop of

00:19:56.196 --> 00:19:58.420
Rochester who could not tolerate
this,

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:03.308
and most famously Thomas More,
the former Lord Chancellor,

00:20:03.308 --> 00:20:10.112
former good servant of the
King, who also could not stomach

00:20:10.112 --> 00:20:12.808
this and died for it.
 

00:20:12.808 --> 00:20:20.900
So we now enter a third phase,
the Henrician Reformation.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.833
Now on the face of it,
the royal supremacy over the

00:20:23.833 --> 00:20:27.528
church had nothing whatever to
do with religious reformation.

00:20:27.528 --> 00:20:31.574
It was a rejection for reasons
of state of the supposedly

00:20:31.574 --> 00:20:35.980
usurped legal jurisdictional
powers of the Bishop of Rome,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:39.922
but it had nothing to do with
Protestantism and it was not

00:20:39.922 --> 00:20:44.279
intended to inaugurate reform in
matters of faith or worship.

00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:47.048
But of course it did.
 

00:20:47.048 --> 00:20:53.450
It took place in a context of
the reformation in Europe.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.692
It aligned England against
Rome, if not necessarily with

00:20:57.692 --> 00:21:01.626
the Protestant princes of
Germany, or the Protestant

00:21:01.626 --> 00:21:03.710
cantons of Switzerland.
 

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:09.775
It gave an initial foothold to
that minority who favored some

00:21:09.775 --> 00:21:15.029
measure of religious reform,
and there were already people

00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:19.125
around the King who were
prepared to use that opportunity

00:21:19.125 --> 00:21:23.166
purposefully,
though necessarily with extreme

00:21:23.166 --> 00:21:23.980
caution.
 

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.539
Thomas Cromwell certainly
favored reform.

00:21:28.539 --> 00:21:31.519
Queen Anne favored reform.
 

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:34.369
She received Protestant books
which were secretly brought to

00:21:34.369 --> 00:21:36.980
her by London merchants and read
them with interest.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.440
Thomas Cranmer favored reform,
as he had done for some years.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.990
On the other hand,
most of the bishops and most of

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:49.118
the nobility were willing to go
only so far with Henry.

00:21:49.118 --> 00:21:53.799
They would accept the royal
supremacy for the good of the

00:21:53.799 --> 00:21:57.005
kingdom,
for the good of the succession,

00:21:57.005 --> 00:22:00.765
but they hoped that it would
all end ultimately in a

00:22:00.765 --> 00:22:02.828
reconciliation with Rome.
 

00:22:02.828 --> 00:22:05.910
So they would go along for the
time being.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:10.227
The key figure in all of this
of course was Henry then

00:22:10.227 --> 00:22:15.115
himself, and once he had the
royal supremacy Henry found that

00:22:15.115 --> 00:22:16.990
he rather liked it.
 

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:19.108
&gt;
 

00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:23.502
He was happy to adopt the
position of a moderate reformer

00:22:23.502 --> 00:22:27.974
of abuses and over time he
increasingly came to believe in

00:22:27.974 --> 00:22:29.778
his own propaganda.
 

00:22:29.778 --> 00:22:35.467
He saw himself as a Solomon,
as a Josiah who had promulgated

00:22:35.467 --> 00:22:40.769
God's law and purged the land of
abuses and idolatry.

00:22:40.769 --> 00:22:45.134
And at the same time the King
was notoriously susceptible to

00:22:45.134 --> 00:22:49.500
influence and if those who held
his trust were able to steer

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.980
things in the direction that
they favored,

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:58.470
then the King might back them
if they were cautious,

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.977
though they were always well
advised to proceed with extreme

00:23:01.977 --> 00:23:05.009
caution in order to retain the
King's confidence.

00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:10.589
He was willing to be influenced
but he could react fiercely if

00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:13.608
he thought he was being abused.
 

00:23:13.608 --> 00:23:18.228
Well, in the mid to late 1530s
Thomas Cromwell and Thomas

00:23:18.228 --> 00:23:21.608
Cranmer certainly had the King's
trust.

00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:25.790
They had served him very well
as Archbishop of Canterbury in

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.476
Cranmer's case or in Cromwell's
case as Vicegerent in

00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:32.287
Spirituals,
the office of administering the

00:23:32.287 --> 00:23:33.910
church on behalf of the King.
 

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.460
And they did a great deal to
mold developments.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.369
In 1536, they issued ten
articles of faith and a set of

00:23:40.369 --> 00:23:44.570
injunctions for the practice of
worship in the church which

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:48.750
moved very,
very cautiously in a reformist

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:49.858
direction.
 

00:23:49.858 --> 00:23:53.910
In 1536, Thomas Cromwell
organized a visitation,

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.625
an inspection,
of the monasteries which was

00:23:56.625 --> 00:24:00.118
deliberately intended to find
abuses and which led,

00:24:00.118 --> 00:24:03.726
later in 1536,
to the dissolution of all

00:24:03.726 --> 00:24:08.720
religious houses worth less than
200 pounds a year,

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.308
the smaller monasteries.
 

00:24:10.308 --> 00:24:14.435
It was not presented as an
attack on monasticism in

00:24:14.435 --> 00:24:17.818
principle but as an attack upon
abuses.

00:24:17.818 --> 00:24:22.505
It was a severe shock and it
was one of the issues which

00:24:22.505 --> 00:24:27.019
provoked in 1536 rebellion in
the north of England.

00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:29.167
That rebellion,
which we'll deal with on

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:32.940
another occasion,
was suppressed in 1537 and in

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.898
the aftermath of that
suppression the larger

00:24:36.898 --> 00:24:41.685
monasteries were gradually
cajoled and encouraged and

00:24:41.685 --> 00:24:48.038
bullied into surrendering freely
their possessions to the crown.

00:24:48.038 --> 00:24:56.240
By 1540, every monastery and
nunnery in the kingdom had gone.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.511
In 1537, Cromwell and Cranmer
engineered the issue of the

00:25:00.511 --> 00:25:04.490
Bishop's Book,
a set of homilies which again

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:09.848
moved cautiously towards
Protestant definitions of faith.

00:25:09.848 --> 00:25:13.682
In 1538, the great shrines,
the great centers of pilgrimage

00:25:13.682 --> 00:25:17.450
at Canterbury and Durham and
elsewhere were dissolved,

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:22.911
their riches seized by the
crown, broken up on the grounds

00:25:22.911 --> 00:25:26.838
that they had been idolatrously
abused.

00:25:26.838 --> 00:25:32.058
And in 1538 the Bible was
issued in English;

00:25:32.058 --> 00:25:34.892
the Great Bible,
a translation into English

00:25:34.892 --> 00:25:39.005
which was actually based upon
the translations of the Bible by

00:25:39.005 --> 00:25:41.769
William Tyndale and Miles
Coverdale,

00:25:41.769 --> 00:25:44.920
both of whom were Protestants.
 

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.568
That was not officially
admitted but it was a fact.

00:25:48.568 --> 00:25:50.892
These were the only
translations ready to hand and

00:25:50.892 --> 00:25:52.930
they needed to produce the Bible
quickly.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.298
The Great Bible,
then, was issued and on the

00:25:55.298 --> 00:25:58.335
frontispiece,
the magnificent frontispiece of

00:25:58.335 --> 00:26:01.942
the Bible,
shows Henry sitting in majesty

00:26:01.942 --> 00:26:06.838
handing down the word of God to
his grateful people.

00:26:06.838 --> 00:26:11.278
There was not much doubt that
by 1539 things had gone a lot

00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:15.868
farther than anyone anticipated
and that elements of reformed

00:26:15.868 --> 00:26:20.690
doctrine were being gradually
smuggled into Henry's church.

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:25.160
But in that year the King
called a halt.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:31.150
The situation had changed again.
 

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:37.010
Another of the events of 1536,
to go back a few years,

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.328
was the fall of Anne Boleyn.
 

00:26:40.328 --> 00:26:45.277
After her marriage to the King
and the promising start of the

00:26:45.277 --> 00:26:50.058
birth of Princess Elizabeth,
no male heir had been born.

00:26:50.058 --> 00:26:53.519
Anne had suffered a series of
miscarriages.

00:26:53.519 --> 00:26:56.544
She was in a state of acute
nervous anxiety,

00:26:56.544 --> 00:26:57.740
understandably.
 

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.720
Eventually, she was suspected.
 

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.318
Word was brought to the kKng
planting suspicions that she had

00:27:03.318 --> 00:27:06.680
committed adultery in her
desperation to have a child.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:08.930
Other accusations were brought
against her.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:14.689
The Queen was arrested and
executed, and shortly thereafter

00:27:14.689 --> 00:27:20.250
Henry married Jane Seymour,
another lady of the court.

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:26.334
The death shortly after that of
Queen Katherine meant that the

00:27:26.334 --> 00:27:32.318
marriage to Jane Seymour was now
of undoubted legitimacy--

00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:35.288
both of Henry's earlier queens
were dead--

00:27:35.288 --> 00:27:39.519
and in 1537 she gave birth,
at last,

00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:43.009
to a male heir, Prince Edward.
 

00:27:43.009 --> 00:27:46.529
Jane herself died in childbed.
 

00:27:46.529 --> 00:27:52.880
So the King had his son.
 

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.067
That could have cleared the way
for reconciliation with Rome and

00:27:57.067 --> 00:28:00.855
his more conservative counselors
hoped that it would do so

00:28:00.855 --> 00:28:04.404
quickly,
but here again Henry's

00:28:04.404 --> 00:28:07.578
personality proved vital.
 

00:28:07.578 --> 00:28:11.864
By now Henry sincerely believed
in his role as Supreme Head of

00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:13.548
the Church of England.
 

00:28:13.548 --> 00:28:17.950
The question at issue was how
he would exercise his power.

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:22.960
His conservative counselors
persuaded him of the dangers of

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:27.538
the growth of radical
Protestantism in the country.

00:28:27.538 --> 00:28:30.496
They pointed out that
Anabaptists had been discovered

00:28:30.496 --> 00:28:33.681
in London, that there were
so-called 'Sacramentarians' at

00:28:33.681 --> 00:28:34.250
large.
 

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:38.059
These were people who followed
the Swiss reformation's teaching

00:28:38.059 --> 00:28:40.150
on the nature of Holy Communion.
 

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:45.064
In 1539, Henry was persuaded to
endorse the Act of Six Articles

00:28:45.064 --> 00:28:49.423
which returned England to
unambiguous Catholic doctrinal

00:28:49.423 --> 00:28:52.118
orthodoxy in matters of faith.
 

00:28:52.118 --> 00:28:57.049
And in 1540 Thomas Cromwell,
having been accused by his

00:28:57.049 --> 00:29:02.803
enemies of secretly encouraging
heresy, was arrested and swiftly

00:29:02.803 --> 00:29:03.990
executed.
 

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:08.174
His real crime was in fact the
fiasco of having arranged the

00:29:08.174 --> 00:29:11.848
King's fourth marriage,
his marriage to the German

00:29:11.848 --> 00:29:15.096
princess Anne of Cleves,
which brought Henry into

00:29:15.096 --> 00:29:17.930
alignment with the Lutheran
princes of Germany.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:22.136
Henry, deceived by a flattering
portrait, was horrified when

00:29:22.136 --> 00:29:23.920
Anne of Cleves arrived.
 

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.798
He described her as a
"Flemish mare."

00:29:25.798 --> 00:29:29.903
He refused to consummate the
marriage and it was swiftly

00:29:29.903 --> 00:29:30.798
dissolved.
 

00:29:30.798 --> 00:29:33.940
This was a lucky break for Anne
of Cleves who retired to estates

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.781
in eastern England where she
happily lived out the rest of

00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:38.536
her life,
so she came out of this quite

00:29:38.536 --> 00:29:39.630
well &gt;
 

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:41.460
all things considered.
 

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.608
Thomas Cromwell lost his head.
 

00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:50.574
Now this phase of events is
often portrayed as a return to

00:29:50.574 --> 00:29:54.328
full Catholic orthodoxy
accompanied by a reinvigoration

00:29:54.328 --> 00:29:57.318
of traditional worship in the
parishes.

00:29:57.318 --> 00:30:00.180
But I think again that goes too
far.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.455
What was ruling in the late
years of Henry was not full

00:30:04.455 --> 00:30:06.118
Catholic orthodoxy.
 

00:30:06.118 --> 00:30:10.983
It was really Henry's own
peculiarly idiosyncratic

00:30:10.983 --> 00:30:15.750
conscience and desires in
matters of religion.

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:21.522
Henry would certainly burn the
occasional radical Protestant if

00:30:21.522 --> 00:30:25.150
one was caught,
but he also executed the

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:29.538
occasional Catholic for opposing
the royal supremacy.

00:30:29.538 --> 00:30:32.782
On one occasion he made a
demonstration by having several

00:30:32.782 --> 00:30:34.808
of each executed on the same
day.

00:30:34.808 --> 00:30:37.833
You can say what you like about
Henry, not a nice man,

00:30:37.833 --> 00:30:40.344
a persecutor,
but he was an equal opportunity

00:30:40.344 --> 00:30:41.200
persecutor.
 

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.019
&gt;
 

00:30:43.019 --> 00:30:48.013
Henry was listening to some of
the conservative voices in the

00:30:48.013 --> 00:30:51.566
council,
especially Bishop Gardiner of

00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:57.202
Winchester and the conservative
faction which circulated around

00:30:57.202 --> 00:31:01.098
Thomas Howard,
the Earl of Norfolk.

00:31:01.098 --> 00:31:04.522
He came under their influence
quite heavily in 1540 when

00:31:04.522 --> 00:31:07.759
Norfolk brought to his attention
his young niece,

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:12.028
Katherine Howard,
who became Henry's new bride,

00:31:12.028 --> 00:31:15.380
his fifth wife,
pushed into his bed at the age

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:19.476
of eighteen by her uncle in the
hope of assuring greater

00:31:19.476 --> 00:31:21.710
influence for his faction.
 

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.436
Nevertheless,
although Henry was increasingly

00:31:24.436 --> 00:31:27.348
under the influence of
conservative figures,

00:31:27.348 --> 00:31:32.019
he never lost his trust in
Thomas Cranmer and indeed he

00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:37.036
shielded Cranmer from enemies
who would have loved to bring

00:31:37.036 --> 00:31:38.680
about his fall.
 

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:44.185
And after the discovery of
Katherine Howard's actual

00:31:44.185 --> 00:31:48.288
adultery in 1542 and her
execution,

00:31:48.288 --> 00:31:54.099
the King was much less
influenced by his more

00:31:54.099 --> 00:31:57.269
conservative advisers.
 

00:31:57.269 --> 00:32:03.425
Certainly, the gradual drift of
the 1530s in the direction of

00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:09.480
some kind of neo-Lutheran reform
of doctrine had halted,

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.951
but England's religion under
Henry in his later years was not

00:32:13.951 --> 00:32:15.220
full orthodoxy.
 

00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:17.470
Parish religion was not as it
had been.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.566
The cult of the saints and the
shrines and the relics had been

00:32:20.566 --> 00:32:21.480
greatly reduced.
 

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.119
The cult of purgatory was gone.
 

00:32:24.119 --> 00:32:26.328
The monasteries were gone.
 

00:32:26.328 --> 00:32:31.748
And on the more positive side a
new vernacular religious culture

00:32:31.748 --> 00:32:36.650
using the English Bible and
English service books had come

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:37.940
into being.
 

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.750
And if really,
truly doctrinally Protestant

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.922
people were still very much a
minority they were a growing

00:32:46.922 --> 00:32:51.640
minority and to some extent a
powerful minority.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.750
They included some very
powerful people whose potential

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.920
influence was out of all
proportion to their numbers.

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.848
Cranmer was still the
archbishop and he favored and

00:33:01.848 --> 00:33:06.328
helped reformers in the
universities and in the church.

00:33:06.328 --> 00:33:11.808
In 1543, Henry's last queen,
Queen Catherine Parr,

00:33:11.808 --> 00:33:14.680
who was as much his nurse as
his queen,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.951
came into a position of
authority and she again showed

00:33:18.951 --> 00:33:21.528
great sympathy towards reform.
 

00:33:21.528 --> 00:33:26.420
The so-called Seymour Circle at
court,

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.348
those gathered around Edward
and Thomas Seymour,

00:33:29.348 --> 00:33:32.190
the brothers of Henry's dead
queen,

00:33:32.190 --> 00:33:35.012
Jane Seymour,
and the uncles of young Prince

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:38.813
Edward,
also favored Protestantism--and

00:33:38.813 --> 00:33:41.823
above all,
perhaps, in their direct

00:33:41.823 --> 00:33:44.345
influence,
the tutors who were appointed

00:33:44.345 --> 00:33:46.980
to the young Prince Edward and
to his sister,

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.333
Princess Elizabeth,
appointed by Archbishop

00:33:49.333 --> 00:33:55.328
Cranmer,
were all closet Protestants.

00:33:55.328 --> 00:33:59.640
So all of this was the legacy
of the Henrician reformation.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.784
It had not been a truly
Protestant reformation but I

00:34:03.784 --> 00:34:08.498
think it marked a far more
significant break with tradition

00:34:08.498 --> 00:34:11.179
than is sometimes recognized.
 

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.989
Okay.
 

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:20.313
Let's move on now to a fourth
phase, the Edwardian

00:34:20.313 --> 00:34:22.119
reformation.
 

00:34:22.119 --> 00:34:25.481
Henry VIII at last died in
January 1547,

00:34:25.481 --> 00:34:30.137
aged only fifty-six though he'd
been in a state of some

00:34:30.137 --> 00:34:32.380
decrepitude for years.
 

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.201
And the new king,
King Edward,

00:34:34.201 --> 00:34:37.655
was only nine and a half years
old and that of course is

00:34:37.655 --> 00:34:41.548
another of those contingencies
that helped to shape the history

00:34:41.548 --> 00:34:43.119
of the reformation.
 

00:34:43.119 --> 00:34:45.371
Edward's uncle,
Edward Seymour,

00:34:45.371 --> 00:34:49.577
led a group of reform-minded
men in taking control at the

00:34:49.577 --> 00:34:51.079
center of power.
 

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:56.413
Seymour was appointed protector
of the young prince and Duke of

00:34:56.413 --> 00:34:57.360
Somerset.
 

00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:00.719
Now as Duke of Somerset and
protector,

00:35:00.719 --> 00:35:04.257
Seymour and his friends' prime
interest was advancing their own

00:35:04.257 --> 00:35:07.851
power and influence,
but there's little doubt that

00:35:07.851 --> 00:35:11.788
he was also of sincere
Protestant views and in that

00:35:11.788 --> 00:35:16.117
context Archbishop Cranmer was
able to exercise far more

00:35:16.117 --> 00:35:19.110
influence than he had since
1539.

00:35:19.110 --> 00:35:22.806
The changes in religion which
were brought about in the next

00:35:22.806 --> 00:35:26.567
two and a half years suggest a
very high degree of commitment

00:35:26.567 --> 00:35:28.510
of these men at the center.
 

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:32.867
They may not have known in 1547
just how far they were going to

00:35:32.867 --> 00:35:35.442
go,
but they certainly intended to

00:35:35.442 --> 00:35:39.889
go further than Henry VIII had
and they acted swiftly once they

00:35:39.889 --> 00:35:41.110
had the power.
 

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:45.329
In 1547, Parliament was
persuaded to repeal the heresy

00:35:45.329 --> 00:35:49.889
laws and the Six Articles;
no more burning of Protestants.

00:35:49.889 --> 00:35:53.478
They issued reformist
injunctions for the removal of

00:35:53.478 --> 00:35:57.135
images and the obliteration of
religious paintings by

00:35:57.135 --> 00:35:59.809
whitewashing them in the
churches.

00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:03.322
That's when those paintings I
described to you in Saint

00:36:03.322 --> 00:36:07.418
Agatha's Easby were whitewashed,
only to be discovered again 400

00:36:07.418 --> 00:36:08.460
years later.
 

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.768
A book of homilies was issued,
official sermons of broadly

00:36:12.768 --> 00:36:15.639
Lutheran sympathy in their
doctrine.

00:36:15.639 --> 00:36:19.282
Religious guilds and
confraternities were suppressed

00:36:19.282 --> 00:36:22.710
and their goods were confiscated
by the crown.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:27.090
In 1548, communion was allowed
in 'both kinds';

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.969
that is, both bread and wine
were administered to the laity

00:36:30.969 --> 00:36:32.710
in the Protestant style.
 

00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:38.755
And in 1549 Cranmer issued a
prayer book, and an act of

00:36:38.755 --> 00:36:45.137
uniformity to insist upon its
use, which was at least half

00:36:45.137 --> 00:36:48.159
Protestant in doctrine.
 

00:36:48.159 --> 00:36:52.719
That prayer book brought brief
rebellion in the west of

00:36:52.719 --> 00:36:55.163
England,
the so-called Prayer Book

00:36:55.163 --> 00:36:57.806
Rebellion,
which centered in the counties

00:36:57.806 --> 00:37:01.829
of the southwest and led briefly
to the siege of Exeter before a

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:05.663
royal army arrived to disperse
the rebels and to follow their

00:37:05.663 --> 00:37:09.559
dispersal with the savage
repression of this resistance.

00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:15.108
Something like 4,000 rebels
were either killed or executed

00:37:15.108 --> 00:37:18.420
immediately after the rebellion.
 

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.547
As a result,
though, Somerset's dominance in

00:37:21.547 --> 00:37:25.985
the council was shaken and he
was replaced as a central figure

00:37:25.985 --> 00:37:30.030
by John Dudley,
the Duke of Northumberland.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.684
That change at the center,
however, did not lead to any

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:34.110
change in religious policy.
 

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:38.195
In fact, Dudley backed
additional innovations in order

00:37:38.195 --> 00:37:42.126
to keep the support of
Archbishop Cranmer and indeed

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:45.210
the favor of the young King
himself.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:50.581
Edward by this time had emerged
as a youth of pronouncedly

00:37:50.581 --> 00:37:55.012
evangelical Protestant beliefs
and inclinations,

00:37:55.012 --> 00:37:57.840
verging indeed on bigotry.
 

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.172
He was often described as the
'young Josiah',

00:38:01.172 --> 00:38:04.806
a biblical figure,
the young king who would bring

00:38:04.806 --> 00:38:08.139
true reform and cleansing of the
church.

00:38:08.139 --> 00:38:12.340
In particular,
in 1552 a further prayer book

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:15.789
was issued,
a revised prayer book,

00:38:15.789 --> 00:38:19.949
this one decisively and openly
Protestant,

00:38:19.949 --> 00:38:24.099
and it was backed in 1553 by an
emphatically Protestant

00:38:24.099 --> 00:38:29.210
statement of faith,
the Forty-two Articles.

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.690
So, okay, let's take stock.
 

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:37.112
The Church of England under
Henry VIII was a peculiarly

00:38:37.112 --> 00:38:41.452
personal blend of doctrinal
orthodoxy with elements of

00:38:41.452 --> 00:38:44.320
reform in worship and practice.
 

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.798
But a true Protestant minority
had emerged especially in London

00:38:48.798 --> 00:38:52.989
and the southeast and among
certain powerful members of the

00:38:52.989 --> 00:38:57.197
social elite,
and under the boy king Edward

00:38:57.197 --> 00:39:02.811
VI and his two regents true
Protestant reform moved ahead

00:39:02.811 --> 00:39:05.420
rapidly over six years.
 

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:09.208
By 1553, the Church of England
was clearly Protestant in

00:39:09.208 --> 00:39:11.690
doctrine and in forms of
worship,

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:17.708
centered on the English Bible
and on the Prayer Book and the

00:39:17.708 --> 00:39:23.320
nation had become deeply divided
in matters of faith.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:30.614
And that leads us to the fifth
phase of this process,

00:39:30.614 --> 00:39:33.699
the Marian Reaction.
 

00:39:33.699 --> 00:39:40.048
Edward VI, the boy king,
died of pulmonary tuberculosis

00:39:40.048 --> 00:39:46.514
only a month after the issue of
the Protestant Forty-two

00:39:46.514 --> 00:39:52.630
Articles of Religion and the
wheel turned again.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:56.717
Desperate to avoid loss of
power, the Duke of

00:39:56.717 --> 00:40:01.639
Northumberland proclaimed as
queen Lady Jane Grey,

00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:05.494
the nearest Protestant
successor who could be named

00:40:05.494 --> 00:40:09.931
except Princess Elizabeth,
who was left out because she

00:40:09.931 --> 00:40:13.000
was still stigmatized as
illegitimate.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.106
Henry VIII's daughter,
Mary, who at this time was

00:40:18.106 --> 00:40:23.746
living in seclusion in East
Anglia, was not willing to

00:40:23.746 --> 00:40:25.449
accept this.
 

00:40:25.449 --> 00:40:28.880
As the daughter of King Henry
and of Katherine of Aragon,

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.880
she raised support amongst the
gentry of East Anglia,

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.510
formed an army and began to
move towards London.

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:39.159
The Duke of Northumberland lost
his nerve.

00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:44.860
He disbanded his troops,
capitulated and gave himself

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:45.409
up.
 

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:51.463
So after the turmoil of the
previous twenty-five years Mary

00:40:51.463 --> 00:40:54.489
had become queen after all.
 

00:40:54.489 --> 00:40:59.530
The thing Henry had sought so
hard to avoid had happened.

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:04.132
Now how far Mary's success in
being able to raise troops and

00:41:04.132 --> 00:41:08.889
finding widespread support for
her accession to the crown,

00:41:08.889 --> 00:41:13.324
how far it was a result of the
fact of her Tudor blood and that

00:41:13.324 --> 00:41:18.072
she clearly was the direct heir,
or how far it depended upon the

00:41:18.072 --> 00:41:22.559
appeal of the fact that she was
known to be deeply loyal to the

00:41:22.559 --> 00:41:26.039
old religion,
that's an open question.

00:41:26.039 --> 00:41:30.650
But a deeply loyal Catholic she
certainly was.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:34.679
Her young life had been
blighted by the dissolution of

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:39.090
her mother's marriage and the
King's subsequent actions.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:43.257
She clung, as part of her very
identity you could say,

00:41:43.257 --> 00:41:47.583
to the old religion and her
subsequent policies bear the

00:41:47.583 --> 00:41:49.000
stamp of that.
 

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.800
And they also reveal just how
divided the nation had become by

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.250
this stage.
 

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.550
Late in 1553,
soon after her accession,

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:04.465
Parliament was persuaded to
repeal Edward's Act of

00:42:04.465 --> 00:42:09.101
Uniformity which had enforced
uniform Protestant worship in

00:42:09.101 --> 00:42:10.300
the nation.
 

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:14.543
Interestingly though,
eighty members of Parliament

00:42:14.543 --> 00:42:18.179
were brave enough to oppose that
action.

00:42:18.179 --> 00:42:22.329
Early in 1554, Mary married.
 

00:42:22.329 --> 00:42:24.760
She married Prince Philip of
Spain,

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:28.641
the future King Philip II,
and that marriage was accepted

00:42:28.641 --> 00:42:31.844
by Parliament,
though with great reluctance

00:42:31.844 --> 00:42:36.182
and only after the suppression
of a brief flurry of rebellion

00:42:36.182 --> 00:42:40.666
in Kent where Sir Thomas Wyatt
led a small army to try to seize

00:42:40.666 --> 00:42:43.920
London and prevent the Spanish
marriage.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.509
The citizens of London shut the
gates against him and he was

00:42:47.509 --> 00:42:48.969
defeated and executed.
 

00:42:48.969 --> 00:42:57.166
Then, in the fall of 1554,
full papal jurisdiction was

00:42:57.166 --> 00:43:00.570
restored in England.
 

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.056
Cardinal Reginald Pole,
the great English churchman who

00:43:03.056 --> 00:43:04.760
had been living in exile in
Italy,

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.856
arrived to absolve the realm
from its schism and was

00:43:08.856 --> 00:43:11.909
appointed Archbishop of
Canterbury,

00:43:11.909 --> 00:43:17.652
but interestingly he was
only--the absolution of England

00:43:17.652 --> 00:43:21.195
from schism--
was only accepted after the

00:43:21.195 --> 00:43:25.735
Pope had agreed that monastery
land would remain with those who

00:43:25.735 --> 00:43:30.420
had been granted it or who had
purchased it under Henry VIII.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.110
That would not be restored to
the church.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:38.018
England then was part of the
Catholic fold again,

00:43:38.018 --> 00:43:39.110
though on terms.
 

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:43.039
Many Protestant ministers in
the church were deprived of

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:47.039
their livings and many of them
went into exile abroad.

00:43:47.039 --> 00:43:49.889
The universities of Oxford and
Cambridge were also purged.

00:43:49.889 --> 00:43:54.112
Some members of Cambridge
colleges and some members of

00:43:54.112 --> 00:43:57.380
Oxford colleges went into exile
abroad.

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:02.099
Something like 800 ministers or
laymen and their families of

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:06.420
pronouncedly Protestant belief
also went into exile.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.518
From December 1554,
those who remained in England

00:44:10.518 --> 00:44:15.130
faced the penalties of a revival
of the Heresy Act,

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:22.860
punishing heresy with death,
and the burnings began.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:29.708
Between 1555 and 1558,
over 300 people were burned at

00:44:29.708 --> 00:44:31.289
the stake.
 

00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:35.353
Some of them were amongst the
most notable figures of the

00:44:35.353 --> 00:44:37.750
Henrician and Edwardian church.
 

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:41.804
Bishops Latimer and Ridley,
two leading Protestants,

00:44:41.804 --> 00:44:44.349
were burned at Oxford in 1555.
 

00:44:44.349 --> 00:44:48.958
Latimer--they were burned
facing each other in the

00:44:48.958 --> 00:44:53.965
marketplace at Oxford--
Latimer famously calling out to

00:44:53.965 --> 00:44:59.340
Ridley as the flames came up,
"be brave, Master Ridley.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.690
Play the man."
 

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:05.889
Archbishop Cranmer was also
burned at Oxford in 1556.

00:45:05.889 --> 00:45:10.711
He had temporally recanted his
Protestantism from his fear of

00:45:10.711 --> 00:45:14.489
death but then went back on his
recantation,

00:45:14.489 --> 00:45:19.900
declared openly his commitment
to the new religion and was

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:24.161
burned in 1556,
holding out into the flames the

00:45:24.161 --> 00:45:28.030
hand with which he had signed
his recantation.

00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:31.396
"This hand hath
offended,"

00:45:31.396 --> 00:45:32.360
he said.
 

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.498
Most of the people who were
burned, however,

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:37.382
were not the great leaders of
the church but humble people,

00:45:37.382 --> 00:45:39.719
most of them from London and
the southeast.

00:45:39.719 --> 00:45:43.925
In fact, almost half the
burnings took place in London,

00:45:43.925 --> 00:45:47.510
in the city of Colchester and
in Canterbury.

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:51.469
The southeast was the focus of
Protestant strength.

00:45:51.469 --> 00:45:53.059
They were usually laypeople.
 

00:45:53.059 --> 00:45:54.969
Only a tenth of them were
clergymen.

00:45:54.969 --> 00:45:57.139
They were often young.
 

00:45:57.139 --> 00:46:02.112
Most of them were under thirty
and a very high proportion of

00:46:02.112 --> 00:46:05.989
those executed were around
twenty years old.

00:46:05.989 --> 00:46:11.440
These were people who had never
really known the old religion

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:16.983
and who had grown up in the new
and proved prepared to die for

00:46:16.983 --> 00:46:17.619
it.
 

00:46:17.619 --> 00:46:21.644
Well, the effects of this
holocaust of Protestant

00:46:21.644 --> 00:46:23.909
resistance are debatable.
 

00:46:23.909 --> 00:46:27.532
Certainly Mary,
her bishops and her advisers

00:46:27.532 --> 00:46:32.503
had simply never expected the
resistance to be so widespread

00:46:32.503 --> 00:46:34.190
or so prolonged.
 

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:38.663
But the fact that Mary
persisted in her policy to the

00:46:38.663 --> 00:46:41.329
end really does her no honor.
 

00:46:41.329 --> 00:46:44.699
If she had no reason to love
her father's memory,

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:49.516
it's clear at least that she
shared his implacability with

00:46:49.516 --> 00:46:53.769
those who opposed her,
and by doing so the persecution

00:46:53.769 --> 00:46:57.154
helped to cement England's
religious divisions and

00:46:57.154 --> 00:47:01.503
associated the old religion with
a level of persecution that was

00:47:01.503 --> 00:47:03.300
wholly unprecedented.
 

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:06.860
There had never been religious
persecution of this intensity,

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:11.865
and indeed it was intense not
only by English standards but by

00:47:11.865 --> 00:47:15.969
the standards of continental
Europe at the time.

00:47:15.969 --> 00:47:22.306
Well, what might have happened
given more time we'll never

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:27.753
know, because Mary died in
November 1558 aged only

00:47:27.753 --> 00:47:29.309
forty-two.
 

00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:34.827
Christopher Haigh suggests,
as have a number of other

00:47:34.827 --> 00:47:40.027
recent historians,
that her reign appears to be an

00:47:40.027 --> 00:47:43.530
aberration only in hindsight.
 

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.922
He thinks she might have
succeeded had she been given

00:47:46.922 --> 00:47:47.380
time.
 

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.869
Protestant resistance would
have lessened,

00:47:49.869 --> 00:47:54.123
the old religion would have
become reestablished fully and

00:47:54.123 --> 00:47:57.719
normalized,
and perhaps that may well be

00:47:57.719 --> 00:47:58.630
the case.
 

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:02.938
But there's also a sense in
which one could say her reign

00:48:02.938 --> 00:48:07.402
was regarded by at least some as
a temporary interlude even

00:48:07.402 --> 00:48:09.018
before her death.
 

00:48:09.018 --> 00:48:14.659
Mary was thirty-seven when she
came to the throne,

00:48:14.659 --> 00:48:19.561
thirty-eight when she married a
Spanish prince who was usually

00:48:19.561 --> 00:48:23.483
absent from her,
abroad seeing to the affairs of

00:48:23.483 --> 00:48:25.260
his other possessions.
 

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:29.510
She was childless despite a
couple of phantom pregnancies

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:31.179
which gave her hope.
 

00:48:31.179 --> 00:48:35.414
She had little prospect of
bearing an heir,

00:48:35.414 --> 00:48:40.960
despite her desperate hopes
both for herself and for her

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:41.969
faith.
 

00:48:41.969 --> 00:48:45.940
For Mary all this was
undoubtedly a personal tragedy

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:50.532
and it's been suggested that she
died in a state of profound

00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:53.179
depression in her last months.
 

00:48:53.179 --> 00:48:58.983
Both those who supported her
and those who opposed her knew

00:48:58.983 --> 00:49:05.090
that in the background was
another claimant to the throne,

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:08.702
Princess Elizabeth,
and that her accession to the

00:49:08.702 --> 00:49:13.144
throne would almost certainly
bring about another alteration

00:49:13.144 --> 00:49:14.349
in religion.
 

00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:18.590
To some degree it could be
anticipated well in advance.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:22.306
What they didn't know,
though, was that this time,

00:49:22.306 --> 00:49:26.858
after the twists and turns of
the generation between 1527 and

00:49:26.858 --> 00:49:28.679
1558, it would last.
 

00:49:28.679 --> 00:49:32.032
And it would last partly
because of the nature of the

00:49:32.032 --> 00:49:35.320
religious settlement which
Elizabeth introduced,

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.869
partly because of the way in
which she was able to defend it,

00:49:39.869 --> 00:49:45.219
and partly for another very
simple contingent reason.

00:49:45.219 --> 00:49:49.411
When Elizabeth was proclaimed
queen on the death of her sister

00:49:49.411 --> 00:49:54.097
on November the 17th,
1558, she was only twenty-five

00:49:54.097 --> 00:49:58.150
years old and she lived to be
seventy--

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:00.760
and more of that next week.
 

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:06.000

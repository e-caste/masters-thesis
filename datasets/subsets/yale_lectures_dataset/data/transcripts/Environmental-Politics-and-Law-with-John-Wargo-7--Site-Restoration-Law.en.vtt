00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.311
Prof: Okay,
so I want to continue the story

00:00:04.311 --> 00:00:07.226
about cleaning up landscapes
that have been severely

00:00:07.226 --> 00:00:07.970
affected.
 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.800
And I wanted to use this as a
basis for reviewing a variety of

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.393
different laws that apply and
certain key provisions in the

00:00:17.393 --> 00:00:21.590
statutes that have met with more
or less success.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.865
And I'm going to start today
with the National Environmental

00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:30.800
Policy Act, which was passed in
late 1969.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.309
And it was one of the first
statutes that declared a

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.370
comprehensive national policy to
protect the environment.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.242
And I wanted to just pause on
this, because many people think

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:45.340
that the idea of sustainability
is fairly new.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.510
But if you look at the purpose
statement inside this statute,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.046
you see that back in the late
1960s that many of the ideals

00:00:52.046 --> 00:00:55.279
that people now believe and
think of when they use the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:59.060
phrase sustainability are deeply
embedded in this statute.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.060
So let me just go through this
quickly.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.674
"The Congress,
recognizing the profound impact

00:01:04.674 --> 00:01:07.605
of man's activity on the
interrelations of all components

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:10.906
of the natural environment,
particularly the profound

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:14.982
influences of population growth,
high-density urbanization,

00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:17.950
industrial expansion,
resource exploitation,

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.769
and new and expanding
technological advances,

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:24.418
and recognizing further the
critical importance of restoring

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:28.067
and maintaining environmental
quality to the overall welfare

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:31.099
and development of man,
declares that it is the

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.700
continuing policy of the federal
government,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.938
in cooperation with state and
local governments and other

00:01:36.938 --> 00:01:39.599
concerned public and private
organizations,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.410
to use all practicable means
and measures,

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.765
including financial and
technical assistance in a manner

00:01:45.765 --> 00:01:49.120
calculated to foster and promote
the general welfare.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.253
To create and maintain
conditions under which man and

00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:56.170
nature can exist in productive
harmony and fulfill the social,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.250
economic, and other
requirements of present and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.060
future generations of
Americans."

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.680
This is an exceptionally broad
mission statement.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.790
This law was passed,
not with any regulatory

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.770
authority, so it could not
prevent human development.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.628
But it demanded instead that
any project,

00:02:15.628 --> 00:02:21.616
private or federal,
that would receive public funds

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:26.877
from the Federal Treasury,
would be required to declare

00:02:26.877 --> 00:02:30.388
exactly what the proposed
development was and to project

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:33.643
out what the environmental
effects might be into the

00:02:33.643 --> 00:02:34.410
future.
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.342
The statute was also curious in
that it included something

00:02:38.342 --> 00:02:40.690
called a citizen suit provision.
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.831
So that environmental groups or
other citizen watchdog groups

00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:49.607
could monitor federal agencies,
they could look at their budget

00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:54.306
and think about what kinds of
development were being proposed

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:57.468
by Congress,
contained in authorization

00:02:57.468 --> 00:03:01.717
statutes or appropriations,
and then think down the road

00:03:01.717 --> 00:03:06.104
about how to make sure that
those developments proceeded in

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:10.188
a way that had a minimal impact
on the environment.

00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:13.641
So this was the origin of the
idea of an environmental impact

00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:17.409
statement,
a model for declaring and

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:24.538
basically making public all
proposals for new development.

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.616
And also, it created an
enormous industry in the

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:31.555
environmental sciences,
an industry that really

00:03:31.555 --> 00:03:35.542
involved soil scientists,
atmospheric chemists,

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:39.566
water quality experts that all
joined together to try to figure

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:43.460
out exactly what the effects of
new development might be.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.241
Now, if you think about the
scale of our economy and you

00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:51.367
think about the federal budget
and you realize that just this

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:55.220
past week our president issued
his proposed budget,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.740
almost $3 trillion.
 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.508
That's an enormous amount of
money being expended that would

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:06.360
be put into projects developed
by the Defense Department,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.461
the Energy Department,
the Department of

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:10.080
Transportation and Highways.
 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.139
Even the Environmental
Protection Agency,

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.425
when they issue a permit now to
a new sewage treatment plant or

00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:18.699
a new water supply facility,
that treatment plant must be

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:22.310
reviewed in the context of an
environmental impact statement.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.577
So that any expenditure of
funds demands that this

00:04:25.577 --> 00:04:27.980
forward-looking projection
occur,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.509
and it's always open to citizen
suit,

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.730
citizen contest through
litigation.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.410
And it's been very effective in
altering new development.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.440
Many dams have been stopped by
this statute,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.598
by judges' interpretation of
it, because of claims of

00:04:44.598 --> 00:04:47.940
insufficiency of the
environmental impact statements.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.213
So that it also includes a very
extensive public hearing process

00:04:53.213 --> 00:04:56.310
whereby drafts have to be
prepared.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.629
They have to be taken to public
hearing,

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:00.740
people have to have an
opportunity to review the

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.942
material so that they can
understand what might be

00:05:02.942 --> 00:05:04.379
happening in their backyard.
 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:08.836
And they may also be very
critical of the quality of

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:09.709
science.
 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.577
And this is not laboratory
science, this is science that

00:05:13.577 --> 00:05:15.899
really is predictive in nature.
 

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.370
It's probabilistic in a sense.
 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.560
So most environmental science
that demands forecasting,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.459
you should think about it as
being probabilistic,

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.499
which is why most programs in
environmental studies have a

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:33.476
requirement for taking
statistics and often

00:05:33.476 --> 00:05:34.610
probability.
 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.449
So the scientists needed to
look into the past and try to

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.495
discern from previous studies
what was most likely to happen

00:05:42.495 --> 00:05:43.730
in the future.
 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.899
And the only way that a project
could be stopped would be if the

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:51.209
impact statement were found to
be insufficient,

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:54.711
to not fully have disclosed
what the effects would be or to

00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:57.550
include science that really was
poorly done,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.889
that did not seem defensible.
 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.170
So I'm going to move on to
discuss several other statutes

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.629
now.
 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.495
But one key point is that
citizen suit provisions have

00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:11.579
been built into a variety of
major environmental laws,

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:14.480
including the Clean Air Act,
the Clean Water Act,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.589
CERCLA, which is the Superfund
law,

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:19.180
the Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act,

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.500
the cradle-to-grave statute
that I mentioned the other day,

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.930
the Emergency Planning and
Community Right to Know Act,

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.964
which gives communities the
right to know what chemicals are

00:06:28.964 --> 00:06:32.656
being released in their
environments if those chemicals

00:06:32.656 --> 00:06:35.870
are recognized to be hazardous
substances,

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.620
and the Endangered Species Act.
 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.084
So basically,
this opportunity for litigation

00:06:42.084 --> 00:06:46.807
has really radically changed the
way that new development and

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:50.430
uses of the environment have
gone forward.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:52.982
Now in this case,
in the case that we talked

00:06:52.982 --> 00:06:56.449
about on Tuesday,
hazardous site on Vieques in

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:00.396
Puerto Rico,
this was a very important

00:07:00.396 --> 00:07:06.223
statute in that the court case,
Romero-Barcelo v.

00:07:06.223 --> 00:07:10.579
Weinberger,
or Weinberger v.

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:14.322
Romero-Barcelo,
was brought in part because the

00:07:14.322 --> 00:07:18.206
Navy had not developed an
environmental impact statement

00:07:18.206 --> 00:07:22.161
that projected out what the
long-term effects might be of

00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.269
their continued bombing of the
island.

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:30.564
So this statute required-- was
interpreted by a judge in Puerto

00:07:30.564 --> 00:07:35.858
Rico to require the development
of a draft environmental impact

00:07:35.858 --> 00:07:38.240
statement,
which was prepared.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.886
It's kind of curious,
because I wanted to find that

00:07:39.886 --> 00:07:41.170
draft environmental impact
statement.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.735
I didn't know whether or not
there might be projections of

00:07:44.735 --> 00:07:48.300
long-term damage or perhaps
accounting of kinds of weapons

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:49.990
that had been released.
 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.399
So I looked for it and in Mudd
Library,

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:55.199
the former government documents
library here,

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:59.754
we had and we still have many
environmental impact statements

00:07:59.754 --> 00:08:01.500
that you can request.
 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.826
Unfortunately,
you can't wander through the

00:08:03.826 --> 00:08:06.430
aisles anymore because it's been
closed down.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.668
But the university still
maintains these environmental

00:08:09.668 --> 00:08:13.028
impact statements that are
actually quite interesting to

00:08:13.028 --> 00:08:14.189
browse through.
 

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:17.278
Well, I couldn't find this
impact statement.

00:08:17.278 --> 00:08:21.788
And then our social science
librarian put out a message on

00:08:21.788 --> 00:08:26.456
her email list and asked if
anybody in the nation might have

00:08:26.456 --> 00:08:27.959
a copy of this.
 

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:30.413
And it turned out that one
person on this list of all

00:08:30.413 --> 00:08:33.200
university libraries and public
libraries responded yes,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.845
that he had collected all
military draft environmental

00:08:36.845 --> 00:08:39.428
impact statements,
including this one.

00:08:39.428 --> 00:08:40.600
So he Xeroxed it and sent it to
me.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.745
It turned out to be a goldmine
in that it demonstrated a

00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:48.666
variety of historical action on
the part of the Navy,

00:08:48.666 --> 00:08:51.379
including diagrams such as
this.

00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:53.490
You see the bombing range up
here on the upper left,

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.710
but you also see in basically
the same scale,

00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:01.924
other maps that the Navy put
together showing where their

00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:05.961
targets were,
showing also color codings of

00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:08.393
these areas,
in this case,

00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:12.480
concentric circles,
that had the metric and the key

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.225
number of bombs dropped or
pounds of bombs dropped per acre

00:09:17.225 --> 00:09:18.370
per year.
 

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.756
So this proved to be really
important, to try to think

00:09:21.756 --> 00:09:24.759
through what was released,
when it was released,

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:26.870
and where it might have gone.
 

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.919
And one interesting thing is
that you see that this side of

00:09:30.919 --> 00:09:35.038
the bay over here looks like it
was continually targeted.

00:09:35.038 --> 00:09:37.913
In fact, tanks were located at
the top of hills,

00:09:37.913 --> 00:09:41.336
and they were clearly being
targeted, both by bombers but

00:09:41.336 --> 00:09:43.110
also by artillery shells.
 

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.908
So gradually,
this area, this part of the

00:09:45.908 --> 00:09:48.220
landscape, was being flattened.
 

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.230
And by flattening the beach
area at the end of that runway,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.323
they basically created a
trough, a trough by which that

00:09:55.323 --> 00:09:58.705
lagoon could drain all of the
material that it had collected

00:09:58.705 --> 00:09:59.678
into the bay.
 

00:09:59.678 --> 00:10:04.356
And also, I looked at this air
photograph maybe thirty or forty

00:10:04.356 --> 00:10:08.883
times and it hadn't dawned on me
that this little light patch

00:10:08.883 --> 00:10:13.408
right here seemed like it was
just an open area of sand.

00:10:13.408 --> 00:10:17.293
But you can track it on Google
Earth and find that it reaches

00:10:17.293 --> 00:10:20.658
down gradually and then fades
into sea grass beds.

00:10:20.658 --> 00:10:23.597
But clearly,
it's evidence that material has

00:10:23.597 --> 00:10:27.355
flowed out of that area and
killed the vegetation on the

00:10:27.355 --> 00:10:28.860
floor of this bay.
 

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.548
The same thing happened on the
other site.

00:10:31.548 --> 00:10:35.495
And if you see these lines in
the diagram down here,

00:10:35.495 --> 00:10:40.291
these lines depict the bombing
route, so that planes would take

00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.690
off from aircraft carriers.
 

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.269
They would fly up in this
direction on the east side.

00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:49.268
They'd circle around and come
back and fly back this way and

00:10:49.268 --> 00:10:50.590
bomb in both directions.
 

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:55.019
So three or four fighter planes
would be doing this continually,

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:58.399
year after year,
decade after decade,

00:10:58.399 --> 00:11:01.558
millions of pounds after
millions of pounds,

00:11:01.558 --> 00:11:06.460
so that they disclosed not just
pounds per acre per year,

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:11.029
but total amount of munitions
so that the estimate of 100 to

00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:15.368
150 million pounds of ordinance
is basically derived from

00:11:15.368 --> 00:11:19.706
information that was provided in
the environmental impact

00:11:19.706 --> 00:11:23.424
statement that would not
otherwise have been made

00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:24.820
available.
 

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.870
Since that time,
I've recognized also that the

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.530
Navy has maintained a really
tough and tight accounting

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.429
system of what they did.
 

00:11:33.429 --> 00:11:35.240
And how would I know that?
 

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.538
Well, by talking to people that
were ordinance officers.

00:11:38.538 --> 00:11:41.246
And you recall those large
concrete bunkers,

00:11:41.246 --> 00:11:44.898
couple hundred concrete bunkers
up in the hills loaded with

00:11:44.898 --> 00:11:46.850
different kinds of weapons?
 

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.863
Well, they were officers or
enlisted men that were

00:11:49.863 --> 00:11:53.370
responsible for the inventory in
each of the buildings.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.864
I mean, they want to know how
many nuclear weapons they've got

00:11:56.864 --> 00:11:59.269
and where they are at any point
in time.

00:11:59.269 --> 00:12:02.269
So they had kept their records
very neatly.

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:06.485
Again, this information was not
included in the environmental

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:09.576
impact statement,
but it provided a basis for

00:12:09.576 --> 00:12:10.629
litigation.
 

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:16.594
So that this type of historical
documentation is often very

00:12:16.594 --> 00:12:18.960
difficult to come by.
 

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.883
Another statute that has played
an important role here and in

00:12:22.883 --> 00:12:25.629
many hazardous sites around the
nation,

00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:28.450
is the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act of 1976,

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.188
which was designed to manage
both hazardous and nonhazardous

00:12:32.188 --> 00:12:33.777
waste,
and included the

00:12:33.777 --> 00:12:37.926
cradle-to-grave tracking system,
meaning that wastes or

00:12:37.926 --> 00:12:42.440
hazardous chemicals from their
time of creation,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:48.899
their movement via ship or by
rail or by tanker truck,

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:53.168
and their ultimate disposal had
to be recorded.

00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:56.250
So it was a large-scale
national inventory system.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.631
And the key to this system,
just the Endangered Species Act

00:12:59.631 --> 00:13:03.014
that I was talking about the
other day or the Safe Drinking

00:13:03.014 --> 00:13:06.200
Water Act,
the core of the system and its

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.096
Achilles' heel,
is really that the chemical has

00:13:09.096 --> 00:13:12.014
to be listed as a hazardous
substance to make its way onto

00:13:12.014 --> 00:13:12.629
the list.
 

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:15.577
So you can imagine that adding
additional chemicals is

00:13:15.577 --> 00:13:18.692
something that the chemical
companies and people that use

00:13:18.692 --> 00:13:21.918
basic chemicals don't really
want to have happen because it

00:13:21.918 --> 00:13:24.811
increases their accounting
responsibilities and their

00:13:24.811 --> 00:13:27.759
reporting responsibilities to
the government.

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:33.158
It included a hazardous waste
land disposal ban.

00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:36.020
And this is kind of
interesting, because there are

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.116
about 300,000 community
landfills sprinkled around the

00:13:39.116 --> 00:13:39.759
nation.
 

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:41.620
Every town has a landfill.
 

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:45.171
They used to call them dumps,
now they call them sanitary

00:13:45.171 --> 00:13:49.039
landfills, which is an oxymoron
if anybody has any sense about

00:13:49.039 --> 00:13:50.690
what's happened there.
 

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.995
But for much of history,
people have taken everything

00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:58.058
and just piled it up in a
landfill.

00:13:58.058 --> 00:14:00.895
And then by about 1950,
they started covering it over

00:14:00.895 --> 00:14:04.168
with soil, not thinking about
where the material might go.

00:14:04.168 --> 00:14:07.331
I remember when I was young
going to our local

00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:09.720
"dump,"
we called it,

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.980
with my dad and watching trucks
pull up,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.778
oil trucks pull up and drain
their tanks into the piles of

00:14:15.778 --> 00:14:16.220
refuse.
 

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:21.942
People that would pull up that
were mechanics that worked on

00:14:21.942 --> 00:14:26.874
people's heating systems,
and they would use solvents to

00:14:26.874 --> 00:14:30.269
take the grease off of
somebody's oil burner.

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:34.039
And that grease and the solvent
would then just be thrown into

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:34.720
the dump.
 

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.115
So that if you dug down beneath
any of these sanitary landfills

00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:40.687
today,
you would find not just

00:14:40.687 --> 00:14:44.298
solvents and residues of oil and
fuel,

00:14:44.298 --> 00:14:46.288
but you'd find many other
chemicals,

00:14:46.288 --> 00:14:49.428
as plastics and other products
degrade,

00:14:49.428 --> 00:14:52.110
just leaching into the soil and
to underlying water.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.220
So that preventing land
disposal was a very significant

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.658
provision back in 1984.
 

00:14:56.658 --> 00:15:00.610
Also, the underground storage
tank program is located in this

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:01.269
statute.
 

00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:05.541
And it requires an inventory
and monitoring of underground

00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:06.740
storage tanks.
 

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.815
And you can imagine that
underground storage tanks that

00:15:10.815 --> 00:15:15.192
contain gasoline or other fuels
or oils sitting beneath the

00:15:15.192 --> 00:15:19.342
surface in a steel tank designed
to last forty years has

00:15:19.342 --> 00:15:22.509
contaminated many,
many sites.

00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:25.263
Those gas stations that you see
with the yellow ribbons around

00:15:25.263 --> 00:15:25.580
them?
 

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:27.490
They basically are regulated
under this statute.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.927
And they are a product of some
engineer who had the bright

00:15:30.927 --> 00:15:33.251
idea,
probably back around 1920 or

00:15:33.251 --> 00:15:37.003
1930, that a forty-year life
cycle for a storage tank made

00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:40.029
out of steel was going to be an
okay thing.

00:15:40.029 --> 00:15:43.376
So what's the life cycle of a
storage barrel,

00:15:43.376 --> 00:15:46.418
a fifty-five gallon drum,
for example?

00:15:46.418 --> 00:15:51.488
So this design error has
polluted ground water and soil

00:15:51.488 --> 00:15:54.210
literally around the world.
 

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.543
And used oils as well,
what happens to that oil that

00:15:57.543 --> 00:16:01.269
your mechanic drains out of your
car when you get your oil

00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:03.230
changed every 3,000 miles?
 

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.730
Well, it used to be just taken
to the town landfill.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:10.428
So this statute prevented that
from happening.

00:16:10.428 --> 00:16:13.980
So Vieques was like any other
community, it had many of these

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.460
landfills, so to speak.
 

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.360
And it was a repository for a
variety of hazardous chemicals.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.168
So key RCRA controversies that
have emerged include the listing

00:16:24.168 --> 00:16:26.960
issue, what's hazardous,
mixtures.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.404
If a waste is mixed with
nonhazardous waste,

00:16:29.404 --> 00:16:30.769
is it still hazardous?
 

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:34.557
This has been a debate that has
been intensely litigated with

00:16:34.557 --> 00:16:37.399
the idea that dilution is not
the solution.

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:41.285
The idea that motor oils,
some of them are exempted,

00:16:41.285 --> 00:16:43.418
even though they're toxic.
 

00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:45.509
That's been the subject of much
litigation.

00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:47.120
Household wastes also.
 

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.470
Can they be mixed up with more
hazardous waste?

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.110
Mining and oil production
wastes have been excluded.

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.986
And one interesting provision
in this case is that corporate

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:02.470
officials can be found guilty of
criminal behavior.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:07.270
So the standard of evidence for
a criminal case is different

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:10.180
than a civil case,
a civil action,

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.980
whereby a civil action would be
decided by a preponderance of

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.237
the evidence,
which means that it's more

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:21.230
likely than not that damage was
induced.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:26.788
But a criminal case demands a
higher burden of proof,

00:17:26.788 --> 00:17:30.969
meaning basically that it has
to be demonstrated that a causal

00:17:30.969 --> 00:17:33.710
link exists beyond a reasonable
doubt.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.249
And RCRA also,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:17:36.249 --> 00:17:38.720
contains a citizen suit
provision.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.069
So by 1986, about 27,000
contaminated sites had been

00:17:43.069 --> 00:17:44.180
identified.
 

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:48.549
And as I mentioned the other
day, now there are more than

00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:53.154
300,000 contaminated sites in
the private sector and perhaps

00:17:53.154 --> 00:17:56.509
50,000 to 100,000 in the public
sector.

00:17:56.509 --> 00:18:00.791
Another statute that is at play
here is the Emergency Planning

00:18:00.791 --> 00:18:04.583
and Community Right to Know Act
that's contained in the

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.900
Superfund amendments of 1986.
 

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.519
And this basically gave every
community the right to know

00:18:10.519 --> 00:18:13.298
about chemicals that are made
by, stored in,

00:18:13.298 --> 00:18:15.690
or emitted from local
businesses.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.740
This evolved after many first
responders experienced toxic

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:26.412
reactions to chemicals that were
stored in buildings that were on

00:18:26.412 --> 00:18:27.210
fire.
 

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:32.422
So they went in to put the fire
out and received intensive

00:18:32.422 --> 00:18:33.519
exposures.
 

00:18:33.519 --> 00:18:35.338
And it created something called
the Toxic Release Inventory.

00:18:35.338 --> 00:18:41.963
The Toxic Release Inventory is
a list of who releases what,

00:18:41.963 --> 00:18:44.019
where, and when.
 

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:47.030
And it has to be provided on an
annual basis to the

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.821
Environmental Protection Agency,
but only if the chemical is put

00:18:51.821 --> 00:18:56.839
on the list and only if it's
produced or present at a level

00:18:56.839 --> 00:19:01.078
that exceeds a certain volume or
weight limit.

00:19:01.078 --> 00:19:05.269
So the SARA amendments
authorized additional funds for

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:10.805
National Priority List sites,
mandated public involvement,

00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:17.138
provided permanent remedies to
restore sites or to basically

00:19:17.138 --> 00:19:19.930
pay for proven damages.
 

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.342
It also requires something
known as best available

00:19:23.342 --> 00:19:25.848
technologies to clean up the
site.

00:19:25.848 --> 00:19:29.932
So a huge question in all these
cases is once a site is

00:19:29.932 --> 00:19:33.108
contaminated,
how should it be restored?

00:19:33.108 --> 00:19:34.950
What's the standard for
restoration?

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.269
Is it pre-human?
 

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:39.430
Is it a certain risk-based
standard so that it's okay to

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:42.762
have a little bit of lead or a
little bit of benzene in the

00:19:42.762 --> 00:19:45.118
soil or the groundwater or the
trees?

00:19:45.118 --> 00:19:47.740
So these are very difficult
questions.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:52.213
No site is cleaned up back to
its pre-polluted condition

00:19:52.213 --> 00:19:56.607
completely, so residues are
always detectible in all of

00:19:56.607 --> 00:19:57.910
these cases.
 

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.450
State standards apply if they
are more stringent.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.416
And this is an interesting
provision, because it's one of

00:20:05.416 --> 00:20:09.880
the few laws that allows states
to preempt federal standards.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.470
So the Clean Air Act basically
preempts Connecticut,

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:17.680
for example,
from having tougher standards

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.298
than the federal government to
emit chemicals to the air.

00:20:22.298 --> 00:20:27.298
But unless, and we'll talk
about this in a week or so,

00:20:27.298 --> 00:20:31.250
unless Connecticut is out of
compliance with the Clean Air

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.960
Act standards,
then we have to meet California

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.098
standards,
which are the toughest in the

00:20:37.098 --> 00:20:37.420
nation.
 

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.241
So the idea of preemption,
preventing a lower level of

00:20:40.241 --> 00:20:43.332
government from passing a law
that is more stringent at the

00:20:43.332 --> 00:20:46.892
federal level of government,
is very desirable from the

00:20:46.892 --> 00:20:49.319
perspective of the private
sector.

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:51.130
Now, why would that be?
 

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.990
Basically, you'd want kind of a
common ground,

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.474
you want to deal with only one
set of regulations rather than

00:20:59.474 --> 00:21:03.134
worrying about moving your goods
or your material or whatever it

00:21:03.134 --> 00:21:04.321
is,
your service,

00:21:04.321 --> 00:21:07.213
across state boundaries and
having to negotiate fifty

00:21:07.213 --> 00:21:09.048
different sets of regulations.
 

00:21:09.048 --> 00:21:13.255
So this is a really important
statutory provision that

00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:16.348
includes the citizen suit
provisions.

00:21:16.348 --> 00:21:19.838
Litigation basically stalled
out RCRA.

00:21:19.838 --> 00:21:22.969
And it stalled out Superfund
cleanups during much of the

00:21:22.969 --> 00:21:26.155
1980s and 1990s predominately
because of the citizen suit

00:21:26.155 --> 00:21:28.538
provision,
it's an interesting thing.

00:21:28.538 --> 00:21:32.200
So that potentially responsible
parties would then sue the

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:34.819
government,
claiming that they really were

00:21:34.819 --> 00:21:38.031
not the primary responsible
party or that they should pay

00:21:38.031 --> 00:21:41.588
only for the proportion of the
material that was hazardous that

00:21:41.588 --> 00:21:43.308
was detected on the site.
 

00:21:43.308 --> 00:21:47.859
So the Superfund amendments of
1986 prevented certain forms of

00:21:47.859 --> 00:21:51.962
litigation by potentially
responsible parties or parties

00:21:51.962 --> 00:21:55.319
that EPA had declared to be
responsible,

00:21:55.319 --> 00:21:57.750
and things sped up.
 

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:02.116
The Vieques story was also
affected by these amendments in

00:22:02.116 --> 00:22:05.755
one way,
in that it created the Agency

00:22:05.755 --> 00:22:09.900
for Toxic Substance and Disease
Registry,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.808
that's quite a mouthful for a
federal agency.

00:22:11.808 --> 00:22:15.036
It sits inside the Centers for
Disease Control,

00:22:15.036 --> 00:22:17.000
based in Atlanta,
Georgia.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.962
And this group has the
responsibility to respond to any

00:22:20.962 --> 00:22:25.294
community that petitions the
federal government arguing that

00:22:25.294 --> 00:22:28.548
they have been damaged,
either their property or their

00:22:28.548 --> 00:22:32.862
health has been damaged,
by federal actions that are now

00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:36.240
declared to be Superfund sites.
 

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.061
So it allows the citizens of
the nation to basically get

00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:43.953
expert scientific advice to
figure out what chemicals are

00:22:43.953 --> 00:22:48.124
released and how people might be
exposed and what the hazards

00:22:48.124 --> 00:22:48.818
are.
 

00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:53.327
And this agency has played a
really unusual role in that they

00:22:53.327 --> 00:22:56.037
very,
very rarely in their history,

00:22:56.037 --> 00:23:00.049
now they're twenty-three,
twenty-four years old,

00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:04.894
they very rarely have found
that there was conclusive

00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:08.528
evidence that the wastes on a
site,

00:23:08.528 --> 00:23:13.835
that the hazardous materials
released produced adverse health

00:23:13.835 --> 00:23:14.720
effects.
 

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.814
So in 2003, they went down to
Vieques because one of the

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:22.759
islanders petitioned the agency
with this question.

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:26.003
And they went about their
business looking for whether or

00:23:26.003 --> 00:23:29.480
not the contaminants in drinking
water might be a problem.

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.410
And they concluded no,
the drinking water is okay.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:35.090
The water comes from a national
forest which is on the mainland

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.980
of Puerto Rico,
and it's actually piped six

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.420
miles underneath the bay to the
island of Vieques.

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.371
They also concluded that now
that the Navy had left the

00:23:44.371 --> 00:23:47.759
island that the air quality was
sufficient so that that did not

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:50.328
pose a significant threat to the
community.

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:53.681
They also concluded that the
food that was grown on the

00:23:53.681 --> 00:23:57.218
island and the fish that were
caught in the coastal waters

00:23:57.218 --> 00:24:01.500
were not contaminated at a level
that posed a significant threat.

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:06.727
So they virtually washed their
hands of this being a

00:24:06.727 --> 00:24:10.519
significant threat to human
health.

00:24:10.519 --> 00:24:13.994
And they dismissed all of the
claims on the part of the

00:24:13.994 --> 00:24:17.727
Vieques residents who believed
that the Navy's behavior and

00:24:17.727 --> 00:24:21.460
their contamination caused a
whole array of different kinds

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:23.519
of adverse health effects.
 

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:31.994
A lawsuit was filed on behalf
of 7,100 residents on the island

00:24:31.994 --> 00:24:40.471
in 2007 that claimed that the
Navy was responsible for loss of

00:24:40.471 --> 00:24:42.000
health.
 

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.194
And the government's response
has been really quite

00:24:44.194 --> 00:24:44.808
interesting.
 

00:24:44.808 --> 00:24:49.660
In one respect,
they responded that well,

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.509
they are protected by sovereign
immunity,

00:24:52.509 --> 00:24:57.894
which basically is an argument
that the king is immune from any

00:24:57.894 --> 00:25:02.795
litigation,
that the king should not be

00:25:02.795 --> 00:25:07.710
held accountable for past
behavior.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.817
They also argued that bringing
a class action lawsuit

00:25:10.817 --> 00:25:14.462
representing a large group of
people like this but focusing in

00:25:14.462 --> 00:25:18.048
on a representative sample of
that group so that you wouldn't

00:25:18.048 --> 00:25:21.394
have to litigate and develop
evidence for each individual

00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:22.828
among the 7,100.
 

00:25:22.828 --> 00:25:28.240
The Justice Department believed
that this should be handled case

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.098
by case.
 

00:25:29.098 --> 00:25:32.313
Now, here's a community that is
well, well below the national

00:25:32.313 --> 00:25:33.170
poverty level.
 

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:36.210
They had no resources to mount
a case like this.

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:40.048
So that several law firms have
picked this up.

00:25:40.048 --> 00:25:43.680
And one in particular has been
pursuing Sanchez versus the

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.700
United States.
 

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.269
And by some mysterious
coincidence,

00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:53.234
there was a convergence of this
lecture and the lecture on

00:25:53.234 --> 00:25:58.635
Tuesday and a CNN documentary on
Vieques that was released this

00:25:58.635 --> 00:25:59.420
week.
 

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.295
I'm going to play you,
if this works,

00:26:01.295 --> 00:26:04.420
I'm going to play you just one
clip from this documentary.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:20.009
&gt;
 

00:26:20.009 --> 00:26:36.960
&gt;
 

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.074
Video voiceover:
 Nearly forty years ago on

00:26:39.074 --> 00:26:41.015
this tiny, remote,
American island of Vieques,

00:26:41.015 --> 00:26:43.000
off the coast of Puerto Rico,
a young U.S.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:54.650
Marine was stationed as a
security guard.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.255
Hermogenes Marrero:
: At age fifty-seven,

00:26:56.255 --> 00:26:57.690
this is Sergeant Hermogenes
Marrero now.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.690
He's had colon cancer twice.
 

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.598
He's nearly blind,
and needs an oxygen tank.

00:27:02.598 --> 00:27:06.328
He has Lou Gehrig's Disease,
crippling back problems,

00:27:06.328 --> 00:27:08.838
and sometimes needs a
wheelchair.

00:27:08.838 --> 00:27:10.519
Hermogenes Marrero:
 This is where we lived.

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:12.298
This is the actual campsite.
 

00:27:12.298 --> 00:27:16.818
Video voiceover:
 Sergeant Marrero says he's

00:27:16.818 --> 00:27:21.700
been sick ever since he was
stationed on the island.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.690
Video interviewer:
Yeah, sure.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.318
All the time.
 

00:27:23.318 --> 00:27:25.359
All the time,
because I used to get sick.

00:27:25.359 --> 00:27:28.058
I used to get sick, you know?
 

00:27:28.058 --> 00:27:30.490
I'd go out to the firing range,
and sometimes I'd start

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.200
bleeding automatically from my
nose.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.900
I said, "My God,
why am I bleeding?"

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.130
I come back and maybe I'm
vomiting now.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:40.710
I used to get diarrhea,
pains in my stomach all the

00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:42.359
time, headaches.
 

00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:43.910
I mean, tremendous headaches.
 

00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.118
My vision, it used to get
blurry.

00:27:46.118 --> 00:27:47.788
Video interviewer:
 So what was over there?

00:27:47.788 --> 00:27:50.133
Video voiceover:
 Today, this decorated

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:52.789
former Marine is the star
witness in a multi-billion

00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:53.779
dollar lawsuit.
 

00:27:53.779 --> 00:27:57.259
More than 7,000 residents of
this Caribbean island,

00:27:57.259 --> 00:28:00.393
about seventy-five percent of
the people here,

00:28:00.393 --> 00:28:01.645
are suing the U.S.
 

00:28:01.645 --> 00:28:02.759
government.
 

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:04.480
They say what the U.S.
 

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.170
military did here made them
sick.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.894
For nearly six decades,
beginning right after World War

00:28:11.894 --> 00:28:14.303
II,
the American island of Vieques

00:28:14.303 --> 00:28:17.692
was one of the Navy's largest
firing ranges and weapons

00:28:17.692 --> 00:28:18.759
testing sites.
 

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:21.506
Video interviewer:
 Can you give us just a

00:28:21.506 --> 00:28:25.053
really detailed picture of what
it was like when they would use

00:28:25.053 --> 00:28:27.170
this island as a training
ground?

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.452
Hermogenes Marrero:
 Inside the base,

00:28:29.452 --> 00:28:31.950
you could feel the ground,
the ground moving.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.849
You can hear the concussions.
 

00:28:34.849 --> 00:28:36.368
You could feel it.
 

00:28:36.368 --> 00:28:39.757
If you were on the range,
you could feel it in your

00:28:39.757 --> 00:28:40.298
chest.
 

00:28:40.298 --> 00:28:41.630
It would rain,
actually rain bombs.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:45.880
And this would go on seven days
a week.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.294
John Eaves,
Jr.:  The people need the

00:28:48.294 --> 00:28:51.440
truth to understand what is
happening to their bodies.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.316
Video voiceover:
 John Eaves,

00:28:53.316 --> 00:28:53.477
Jr.
 

00:28:53.477 --> 00:28:55.298
is the attorney in the lawsuit.
 

00:28:55.298 --> 00:28:57.106
John Eaves,
Jr.:  One of the biggest

00:28:57.106 --> 00:28:59.603
problems we have is that we
don't believe that the military

00:28:59.603 --> 00:29:02.055
has fully come clean with all
the chemicals and the agents

00:29:02.055 --> 00:29:03.818
that have been used on this
island.

00:29:03.818 --> 00:29:20.084
Like depleted uranium was
denied and then they admitted

00:29:20.084 --> 00:29:21.588
it.
 

00:29:21.588 --> 00:29:22.973
Video voiceover:
In my experience in dealing

00:29:22.973 --> 00:29:24.220
with hazardous sites and toxic
substances,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.486
Vieques is likely to be one of
the most contaminated sites in

00:29:27.486 --> 00:29:28.140
the world.
 

00:29:28.140 --> 00:29:30.797
Video voiceover:
 Dr. John Wargo is a Yale

00:29:30.797 --> 00:29:33.787
professor who studies the
effects of toxic exposures on

00:29:33.787 --> 00:29:34.838
human health.
 

00:29:34.838 --> 00:29:37.730
He believes people on the
island are sick because of the

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:38.940
Navy's bombing range.
 

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.291
John Wargo,
on video:  This

00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:42.710
contamination results from the
longevity of the bombing,

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:44.529
the shelling,
the strafing,

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:47.750
and many different compounds
were released,

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:49.640
including lead and mercury and
cadmium,

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.470
as well as flame retardants,
fuels,

00:29:52.470 --> 00:31:01.140
and many of these were released
in great intensity.

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:08.866
Video voiceover:
: So, do you think this island

00:31:08.866 --> 00:31:11.200
made you sick?
 

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:21.282
Hermogenes Marrero:
: Do you swear to testify the

00:31:21.282 --> 00:31:27.700
truth, and nothing but the
truth?

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.486
Video voiceover:
: Agent Orange

00:31:29.486 --> 00:31:30.788
&gt;
 

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:35.288
and we used to store it in the
hazardous material area.

00:31:35.288 --> 00:31:53.680
It was used in Vieques as a
defoliant for defense line.

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.900
Video voiceover:
: This is American territory.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.410
The people that live here are
Americans.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:02.259
And how do you do something in
your own back yard,

00:32:02.259 --> 00:32:07.211
and you hurt someone,
you have to take care of that

00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:08.298
person.
 

00:32:08.298 --> 00:32:12.470
And the government's just not
doing anything about it.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:23.269
&gt;
 

00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:25.440
&gt;
 

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.250
Prof: All right,
now as you reflect on that,

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.390
you should be asking yourself a
whole bunch of questions.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:34.935
One of them would be,
here's a gentleman who is now

00:32:34.935 --> 00:32:36.490
mid-fifties.
 

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:38.670
He obviously has many different
medical problems.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:43.830
But he faces a serious burden
of proof of exposure to

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:48.098
chemicals that were released by
the Navy.

00:32:48.098 --> 00:32:50.480
So how would you think that
through?

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.480
How would you make that
connection?

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:56.614
One question you might ask is,
were the chemicals that they

00:32:56.614 --> 00:32:59.531
described in the lawsuit that
were released by the Navy

00:32:59.531 --> 00:33:00.828
present in his body?
 

00:33:00.828 --> 00:33:02.998
Well, you know,
the historical reconstruction

00:33:02.998 --> 00:33:05.710
problem that I mentioned on
Tuesday is extraordinary.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:09.711
It's incredibly complex
scientifically and would be very

00:33:09.711 --> 00:33:13.785
expensive to document how long
do these chemicals last in

00:33:13.785 --> 00:33:15.240
somebody's body?
 

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:18.150
What are plausible alternative
sources of exposure?

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:23.148
You know, the Navy argued that
heavy metals used in the weapons

00:33:23.148 --> 00:33:27.987
were also minerals that had been
driven by winds from Saharan

00:33:27.987 --> 00:33:32.180
dust storms across the Pacific
and rained down,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.880
and perhaps that's a route of
exposure.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.460
So the Navy's been very good,
along with the Justice

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.090
Department, in developing these
plausible alternative

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:39.848
hypotheses.
 

00:33:39.848 --> 00:33:43.390
Another has been the
ritualistic use of mercury.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.423
Did the mercury come from Navy
switches in the bombs that

00:33:47.423 --> 00:33:50.885
leaked out on that site,
made its way into the Marine

00:33:50.885 --> 00:33:52.837
food chain,
built up, and then made its way

00:33:52.837 --> 00:33:54.690
to the dinner table and into
people's bodies?

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.558
Or did it come from an electric
plant that was located on the

00:33:58.558 --> 00:33:59.140
island?
 

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:03.019
Or could it have come from any
fish in the area?

00:34:03.019 --> 00:34:07.230
When the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:11.646
did their fish sample,
they wandered around the island

00:34:11.646 --> 00:34:15.329
sampling fish from many
different locations.

00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:19.067
But as I mentioned,
often the sample sizes were

00:34:19.067 --> 00:34:22.480
incredibly small,
less than ten in size.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:27.023
So what you'd want to do is,
you'd want to know that these

00:34:27.023 --> 00:34:31.409
chemicals had moved in a
gradient from their location of

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:34.360
release further and further
away.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.065
And you hoped to find a
declining gradient in the

00:34:37.065 --> 00:34:40.110
concentration as you moved
further and further away.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.489
But they didn't conduct this
kind of work.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.793
James Porter,
who is the professor at the

00:34:44.793 --> 00:34:48.309
University of Georgia that I
mentioned, has done that work.

00:34:48.309 --> 00:34:51.340
As you move further and further
away from the bombed area,

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:52.829
you do see these declines.
 

00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:55.204
So key questions that are
raised by this video,

00:34:55.204 --> 00:34:58.150
what was the prior knowledge of
the Defense Department?

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:01.184
I know that the Defense
Department had very accurate

00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:04.637
records of the ordinance that
was released and where it was

00:35:04.637 --> 00:35:06.900
released and when it was
released.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.619
Another key question is,
should this move forward as a

00:35:09.619 --> 00:35:10.800
class action lawsuit?
 

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.724
If the courts find that it
cannot, that it has to be judged

00:35:16.724 --> 00:35:19.300
individually,
person by person,

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:22.681
there's no hope that this would
be concluded in the next fifty

00:35:22.681 --> 00:35:23.179
years.
 

00:35:23.179 --> 00:35:26.380
The idea of sovereign
immunity--should the United

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:27.980
States be responsible?
 

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.519
And this is spoken to quite
clearly in a variety of

00:35:31.519 --> 00:35:35.626
environmental statutes that I
described to you just fifteen

00:35:35.626 --> 00:35:36.760
minutes ago.
 

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.492
But the central,
core question here is one of

00:35:40.492 --> 00:35:41.510
causation.
 

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:44.739
Did these chemicals cause those
illnesses?

00:35:44.739 --> 00:35:48.119
What's the matchup between the
chemicals released,

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:49.739
the chemicals found in people's
bodies,

00:35:49.739 --> 00:35:52.347
and what we know medically
about the effects of those

00:35:52.347 --> 00:35:52.949
chemicals?
 

00:35:52.949 --> 00:35:54.360
This is very difficult science.
 

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:58.139
To be held to a standard of
scientific proof,

00:35:58.139 --> 00:36:01.096
say ninety-nine percent
confidence that there is this

00:36:01.096 --> 00:36:04.280
established cause and effect
relationship would virtually

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.750
make it impossible for this
community to recover damages.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:13.210
Beyond a reasonable doubt,
it's a different matter.

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:17.851
So what you see here is you see
the media getting behind this

00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:19.936
case,
being sympathetic,

00:36:19.936 --> 00:36:24.090
having a very clear story about
chemical release,

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:26.260
not really knowing where it
went.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:31.148
Not really fully understanding
what people's exposures were,

00:36:31.148 --> 00:36:35.373
how they might have been
exposed via air or water or

00:36:35.373 --> 00:36:36.119
food.
 

00:36:36.119 --> 00:36:40.789
But you also have a community
that has lived in an environment

00:36:40.789 --> 00:36:44.159
that socially has been seriously
affected.

00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:47.737
There is no debate about the
fact that the presence of the

00:36:47.737 --> 00:36:51.628
military put the economy of that
island in the freezer for much

00:36:51.628 --> 00:36:53.449
of the twentieth century.
 

00:36:53.449 --> 00:36:57.489
And the impact of that in
diminishing their income,

00:36:57.489 --> 00:37:01.722
diminishing their access to
basic public services such as

00:37:01.722 --> 00:37:05.710
education and healthcare,
such as early detection,

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:10.391
having to travel off the island
when you don't own a car to a

00:37:10.391 --> 00:37:14.056
hospital on the mainland of
Puerto Rico is a big

00:37:14.056 --> 00:37:17.489
disincentive to get early
medical care.

00:37:17.489 --> 00:37:21.059
So late medical care translates
into a higher incidence of

00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:24.942
disease and detection when the
illness has progressed to become

00:37:24.942 --> 00:37:28.266
more serious,
becomes more difficult to

00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:28.969
manage.
 

00:37:28.969 --> 00:37:31.974
Also, everyone is thinking
about "Okay,

00:37:31.974 --> 00:37:34.559
what is the cost going to
be?"

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:37.039
What's a likely cost for this
one site?

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:39.889
And remember the figure that I
showed you the other day,

00:37:39.889 --> 00:37:45.646
that Congress allocates roughly
two to $2.5 billion dollars per

00:37:45.646 --> 00:37:49.360
year for the entire Superfund
program.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.867
Whereas plausibly,
it could take up to a billion

00:37:52.867 --> 00:37:57.047
dollars to clean this area and
also to provide sufficient

00:37:57.047 --> 00:37:59.659
medical care for the community.
 

00:37:59.659 --> 00:38:04.264
And also remember the fact that
many of these families had

00:38:04.264 --> 00:38:08.949
earlier generations that were
plucked up off their property

00:38:08.949 --> 00:38:10.079
and moved.
 

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:13.143
How would you think about
compensating them for their loss

00:38:13.143 --> 00:38:14.219
of property value?
 

00:38:14.219 --> 00:38:18.119
Given $25 in 1945 for a tract
of land,

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:23.239
or for the costs incurred by
having your house bulldozed and

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:28.360
having the family move to a
different part of the island.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.815
So it also raises a very
interesting counterpoint to the

00:38:31.815 --> 00:38:35.018
Marshall Islands case that we
saw the other week.

00:38:35.018 --> 00:38:38.788
And that is that when the
United States decided to take

00:38:38.788 --> 00:38:42.556
over the Marshall Islands,
they did so thinking that no

00:38:42.556 --> 00:38:45.210
one could survive an attack
there.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.530
They had to move everybody out
of the islands that they bombed.

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:50.630
In this case,
they believed that they could

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:55.132
conduct their weapons testing in
a way that would not harm the

00:38:55.132 --> 00:38:56.239
population.
 

00:38:56.239 --> 00:38:59.027
If they concentrated them in
the center of the island and

00:38:59.027 --> 00:39:01.766
they bombed the end of the
island, they weren't thinking

00:39:01.766 --> 00:39:03.360
ecologically about pathways.
 

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.809
They weren't thinking about
diet.

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:07.516
They weren't thinking about
airborne dust and prevailing

00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:07.909
winds.
 

00:39:07.909 --> 00:39:12.440
So that the idea that they
should move the entire

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:16.690
population off the island was
reconsidered.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:20.947
There are now available
documents demonstrating that

00:39:20.947 --> 00:39:25.539
John Kennedy thought very,
very carefully about this.

00:39:25.539 --> 00:39:28.268
And Kennedy,
you remember was president

00:39:28.268 --> 00:39:30.280
during the Cuban invasion.
 

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:34.592
And Vieques was a very
important base for staging for

00:39:34.592 --> 00:39:37.079
the invasion of Bay of Pigs.
 

00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:40.172
And what Kennedy was thinking
about was okay,

00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:44.458
why don't we completely remove
the islanders and resettle them

00:39:44.458 --> 00:39:46.989
in other parts of the Caribbean?
 

00:39:46.989 --> 00:39:49.210
He decided against that move.
 

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:52.822
But that decision perhaps has
come back to haunt the

00:39:52.822 --> 00:39:56.650
government, and certainly is
haunting the islanders.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:02.713
However, this whole mess is a
product of misunderstanding

00:40:02.713 --> 00:40:09.405
basic ecological principles,
as well as I think a disregard

00:40:09.405 --> 00:40:14.190
for the long-term health of the
community.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:17.550
There are a couple of other
statutes here that are at play.

00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:23.632
And I wanted to bring your
attention to the Wilderness Act

00:40:23.632 --> 00:40:24.699
of 1964.
 

00:40:24.699 --> 00:40:30.009
And this statute is quite
interesting in that it defines

00:40:30.009 --> 00:40:33.297
wilderness as,
"An area in contrast with

00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:36.099
those areas where man and his
own works dominate the

00:40:36.099 --> 00:40:38.510
landscape,
is hereby recognized as an area

00:40:38.510 --> 00:40:40.840
where the Earth and its
community of life are

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.681
untrammeled by man,
where man himself is a visitor

00:40:43.681 --> 00:40:45.139
who does not remain."
 

00:40:45.139 --> 00:40:49.400
And it goes on to define
characteristics of an area that

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:53.427
would have to be met before it
could be designated as

00:40:53.427 --> 00:40:54.590
wilderness.
 

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:59.239
But at the same time that the
government left Vieques and

00:40:59.239 --> 00:41:04.137
transferred jurisdiction to the
Fish and Wildlife Service to

00:41:04.137 --> 00:41:05.550
create a U.S.
 

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:09.054
Fish and Wildlife Refuge on the
island, Congress decided that it

00:41:09.054 --> 00:41:12.280
was also going to declare the
area a federal wilderness.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.644
So it is distinctive in the
United States right now because

00:41:15.644 --> 00:41:19.753
it is the only Superfund site,
reserved for the most hazardous

00:41:19.753 --> 00:41:22.900
sites in the nation,
that is also declared to be a

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:26.733
wilderness area,
a paradox that maybe you could

00:41:26.733 --> 00:41:32.190
explain to me,
especially looking at the site.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:36.985
The government clearly thought
that it would give them greater

00:41:36.985 --> 00:41:41.105
power to exclude people,
which they think they're doing

00:41:41.105 --> 00:41:43.500
well by posting signs on the
beach.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.487
This is a sign that is right on
the edge of the water that is

00:41:47.487 --> 00:41:51.474
within perhaps a hundred yards
of tanks sitting on a hillside

00:41:51.474 --> 00:41:54.996
that became the target for
planes as well as artillery

00:41:54.996 --> 00:41:55.860
shells.
 

00:41:55.860 --> 00:42:00.974
So the idea that you could post
a sign and it would keep people

00:42:00.974 --> 00:42:01.469
out.
 

00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:07.119
I took a research crew out
there several years ago.

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:10.699
And one afternoon,
there were six or eight large

00:42:10.699 --> 00:42:14.813
pleasure boats all lined up
about fifty yards from this

00:42:14.813 --> 00:42:15.500
sign.
 

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:19.639
Kids were out swimming in the
water, playing on the beach.

00:42:19.639 --> 00:42:23.255
So the idea that you could
control people via signs,

00:42:23.255 --> 00:42:26.659
with no other presence,
it defies explanation.

00:42:26.659 --> 00:42:32.114
Another statute that's at play
here is the Endangered Species

00:42:32.114 --> 00:42:32.659
Act.
 

00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:35.639
And the purposes of this
statute, passed in 1973,

00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:38.996
are to provide a means whereby
the ecosystems upon which

00:42:38.996 --> 00:42:42.170
endangered species and
threatened species depend,

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.780
may be conserved to provide a
program for their conservation.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:52.114
So certain types of acts,
including damaging the habitat

00:42:52.114 --> 00:42:57.443
of an endangered species,
or taking an endangered species

00:42:57.443 --> 00:43:00.498
and either shooting it,
by killing an endangered

00:43:00.498 --> 00:43:03.380
species, you are taking it,
under this statute.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:07.876
So this law,
again, passed back in 1973,

00:43:07.876 --> 00:43:09.489
and the U.S.
 

00:43:09.489 --> 00:43:13.831
left the island in 2003,
there were three decades during

00:43:13.831 --> 00:43:17.860
which species declared to be
rare or endangered,

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:21.400
particularly the turtles that
lived on the island,

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:25.489
were clearly being affected by
military behavior and maneuvers.

00:43:25.489 --> 00:43:28.521
So here's a list of the
species, if any of you happen to

00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:30.119
be particularly interested.
 

00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:34.626
So I'm going to have to scoot
ahead here, so we can keep

00:43:34.626 --> 00:43:35.610
moving on.
 

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:40.786
But I wanted you to recognize
that this history of military

00:43:40.786 --> 00:43:43.402
action,
of training,

00:43:43.402 --> 00:43:49.143
basically testing weapons,
of staging maneuvers that

00:43:49.143 --> 00:43:53.324
preceded major military actions,
it's created a legacy of

00:43:53.324 --> 00:43:56.920
severely contaminated sites
around the nation.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.884
Here's Johnston Atoll,
which is now the Pacific

00:43:59.884 --> 00:44:02.139
Islands National Wildlife
Refuge.

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:05.760
So you see, there actually is a
pattern of taking a former

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.110
highly contaminated military
base,

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:12.280
transferring its jurisdiction
into a Fish and Wildlife refuge.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.355
This may look like the
moonscape, but this is the

00:44:15.355 --> 00:44:19.563
atomic testing site in Nevada,
where you can see the craters

00:44:19.563 --> 00:44:23.969
that are the result of hundreds
of other above ground tests.

00:44:23.969 --> 00:44:28.143
Here's another highly
contaminated site in Hanford,

00:44:28.143 --> 00:44:29.230
Washington.
 

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.148
The Hanford Works,
the site of the Green Run,

00:44:32.148 --> 00:44:35.929
that you could read about in
Green Intelligence.

00:44:35.929 --> 00:44:39.746
The underground storage tanks,
the same problem that I

00:44:39.746 --> 00:44:42.340
mentioned earlier in the
lecture,

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:47.242
leaking radioactive waste that
is highly concentrated into the

00:44:47.242 --> 00:44:48.610
Columbia River.
 

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:54.777
The Columbia River is a habitat
for Pacific salmon and many

00:44:54.777 --> 00:44:57.329
other species of fish.
 

00:44:57.329 --> 00:45:00.760
And it's a very highly prized
region.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:03.788
The military reservation on
Cape Cod provides one more

00:45:03.788 --> 00:45:04.360
example.
 

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:09.489
This reservation has a history
that spanned just about the same

00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:14.041
amount of time as Vieques,
from about 1940 to just about

00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:16.690
the year 2000,2001 actually.
 

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:21.510
The jets that we're trying to
catch up to on the September 11,

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:25.916
2001, hijackers,
they were scuttled from the

00:45:25.916 --> 00:45:30.940
Massachusetts military
reservation on Cape Cod.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:36.170
This site is sitting on sands
and gravels.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:41.416
And it's basically a collection
of very large aquifers on Cape

00:45:41.416 --> 00:45:44.257
Cod,
in which the freshwater sits on

00:45:44.257 --> 00:45:48.659
top of underlying saltwater the
closer you get to the ocean.

00:45:48.659 --> 00:45:52.364
So that anything put on the
surface will drain into

00:45:52.364 --> 00:45:56.219
underlying sands and aquifers
moving very quickly.

00:45:56.219 --> 00:46:00.353
So this has become the largest
drinking water contamination

00:46:00.353 --> 00:46:04.130
site and remediation site in the
United States now.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:08.367
They drilled some 8,000
different wells to try to figure

00:46:08.367 --> 00:46:11.820
out where the fuels,
the flame retardants,

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:15.144
the munitions residues,
the TNT and RDX,

00:46:15.144 --> 00:46:17.050
etc., where did it go?
 

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:20.253
And they've monitored it out,
and they created these plumes

00:46:20.253 --> 00:46:23.179
that pump the water up,
out of that aquifer and then

00:46:23.179 --> 00:46:26.405
into these charcoal tanks,
activated carbon tanks,

00:46:26.405 --> 00:46:30.630
some of which are bigger than
this entire lecture hall.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:34.900
So day after day,
twenty-four hours a day,

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.652
decade for decade,
this water is pumping through

00:46:37.652 --> 00:46:40.177
there,
hoping that it will be cleaned

00:46:40.177 --> 00:46:44.106
up to meet the Safe Drinking
Water Act standards by the year

00:46:44.106 --> 00:46:44.639
2035.
 

00:46:44.639 --> 00:46:48.432
Three thousand pounds of
solvents have been removed from

00:46:48.432 --> 00:46:49.329
that water.
 

00:46:49.329 --> 00:46:51.713
One thousand pounds of fuels
was removed from the

00:46:51.713 --> 00:46:52.409
groundwater.
 

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:54.994
And eight plumes are now
undergoing treatment and

00:46:54.994 --> 00:46:55.750
remediation.
 

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:59.735
This is immediately adjacent to
a variety of cranberry bogs,

00:46:59.735 --> 00:47:03.856
so cranberry farmers bore the
brunt of economic loss when this

00:47:03.856 --> 00:47:05.139
was discovered.
 

00:47:05.139 --> 00:47:09.192
So critical lessons here about
Vieques, knowledge is power,

00:47:09.192 --> 00:47:10.590
that's very clear.
 

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:14.539
Classified information prevents
the public from understanding

00:47:14.539 --> 00:47:16.420
what was done,
when and where,

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.311
what the nature of surrounding
or nearby community threats

00:47:19.311 --> 00:47:19.920
might be.
 

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.260
A question of who conducts the
science.

00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.425
It's clear that the ATSDR who
are within the Centers from

00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:29.121
Disease Control,
was not doing high quality

00:47:29.121 --> 00:47:35.375
science and came to a premature
conclusion of safety based upon

00:47:35.375 --> 00:47:38.300
a highly limited sampling.
 

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.639
Science normally proves no
causal relation.

00:47:41.639 --> 00:47:45.956
So this type of science is
perhaps one of the more complex

00:47:45.956 --> 00:47:47.699
that I could imagine.
 

00:47:47.699 --> 00:47:52.538
Also one lesson here that is
apparent is that new evidence of

00:47:52.538 --> 00:47:57.458
risky behavior generates a very
defensive attitude on the part

00:47:57.458 --> 00:47:58.909
of government.
 

00:47:58.909 --> 00:48:02.795
So any information that they
release, any studies that they

00:48:02.795 --> 00:48:05.610
conduct, could increase their
liability.

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:09.811
So often the response is
"Well, then let's just not

00:48:09.811 --> 00:48:11.110
study it."
 

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.768
Okay.
 

00:48:12.768 --> 00:48:14.378
I'm going to pause there,
and just wish you a great

00:48:14.378 --> 00:48:14.699
weekend.
 

00:48:14.699 --> 00:48:21.000

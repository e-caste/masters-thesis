00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.916
Prof: "In the
beginning was the word and the

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:11.178
word was with God"--
somebody actually has memorized

00:00:11.178 --> 00:00:11.670
this.
 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.720
I'm so proud of you.
 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.440
I got me some good Sunday
school people in the class,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.590
or at least somebody who's done
the reading for the day.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.290
"And the word was with God
and the word was God.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.047
He was in the beginning with
God, all things came into being

00:00:30.047 --> 00:00:31.660
through him."
 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.718
God, what a philosophical
sounding term,

00:00:35.718 --> 00:00:37.800
"being."
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.642
It screams to be capitalized
like Hegel or someone like that

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.120
would do--being.
 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.120
Do you sit around in your dorm
room worried about being?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.740
What is the nature of being?
 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.770
What is the nature of existence?
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.590
Yeah?
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.950
No?
 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.960
If you do you're a good
philosopher.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.939
"What has come into being--
" now that's also very

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.611
philosophical,
in traditional classical

00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:12.343
philosophy from Plato on,
being is one kind of thing and

00:01:12.343 --> 00:01:16.590
coming into being is something
else.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.355
Things that are truly,
truly, truly being don't come

00:01:20.355 --> 00:01:24.417
into being because that means at
one time they were not,

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.150
and this sounds so
philosophical.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.608
"And the life was the
light was all people,

00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:34.510
the light shines in the
darkness, the darkness did not

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.129
overcome it."
 

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:40.215
You skip down a bit,
verse 14, "The word became

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:42.379
flesh and lived among us.
 

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:47.245
And we have seen his glory,
the glory as of a father's only

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:50.349
son, full of grace and
truth."

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:55.165
That sounds not only
philosophical but downright

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:56.599
theological.
 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.690
"No one has ever seen
God."

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.019
Good theological point, right?
 

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:06.302
"It is God the only
Son--" have we heard

00:02:06.302 --> 00:02:12.770
anything like that kind of
language so far in this course?

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.020
"God the only Son."
 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.750
No, we haven't.
 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.030
That sounds like a Christian
creed.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.680
It doesn't sound like Matthew,
Mark, and Luke.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.354
It doesn't sound like Acts,
it doesn't even sound like

00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:30.979
Thomas.
 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.288
We're in a different world with
this Gospel.

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:37.669
This is not like anything we've
seen so far.

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:41.336
So from the very beginning of
the Gospel of John,

00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:45.234
you should know you're in a
different world from the

00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.603
synoptic Gospels:
Matthew, Mark,

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:48.750
and Luke.
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.050
The style, for example,
over and over again the style

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.128
is repetitious.
 

00:02:53.128 --> 00:02:56.503
There are phrases and words
that come up over and over

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:59.560
again, darkness and light,
light and darkness.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.199
I already did some of that with
the--

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.818
"In the beginning was the
word,

00:03:03.818 --> 00:03:05.960
the word was with God,
the word was God,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.330
he was in the beginning with
God, all things came into being

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.620
through him without him not one
thing came into being,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.008
what has come into being."
 

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:15.445
"Come into being"
is repeated three times,

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.074
a little clue:
don't write your exegesis

00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:19.490
papers like this.
 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.665
This is not good American
English writing style,

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:25.842
you're supposed to vary your
terminology, right,

00:03:25.842 --> 00:03:28.479
a little bit,
and alter your terms;

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.060
that's good English writing
style.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.111
This of course is actually
fairly good ancient Greek

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.324
writing style which is the
different--the writing styles

00:03:34.324 --> 00:03:35.050
are different.
 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.190
It's also a writing style that
we haven't seen so far.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.483
There's this repetition of
words, there are memorable

00:03:41.483 --> 00:03:45.092
sayings in the Gospel of John
that you don't have in other

00:03:45.092 --> 00:03:45.788
places.
 

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:49.233
There's a whole lot less action
in the Gospel of John and a

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:50.538
whole lot more talk.
 

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:54.330
Just flip open the Gospel of
John almost anyplace and it'll

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.431
start off with a scene,
often a conflict scene with

00:03:58.431 --> 00:04:01.468
Jesus in kind of a--
in conversation with other

00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:01.830
people.
 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.462
But pretty quickly it'll go
into a dialogue in which Jesus

00:04:05.462 --> 00:04:07.688
is saying something,
the other person says

00:04:07.688 --> 00:04:09.210
something, they go back and
forth a bit,

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.860
and then it goes even from a
dialogue into Jesus just being

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.818
Chatty Cathy and just talking
for paragraphs.

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:19.452
We don't have any of this kind
of stuff in the synoptics of

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:23.209
Jesus just going off on tangents
for paragraphs at a time and

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:25.839
talking for a whole chapter
sometimes.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:29.759
And that's what you get in the
Gospel of John.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.776
There are some scenes in the
Gospel of John where the

00:04:32.776 --> 00:04:36.081
characters look actually more
lifelike than they do in the

00:04:36.081 --> 00:04:37.300
synoptic Gospels.
 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.586
Have you noticed in the
synoptic Gospels the characters

00:04:40.586 --> 00:04:42.899
sometimes are just a tax
collector,

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.440
a sinner, a Pharisee,
a Syrophoenician woman,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.129
a Centurion who had a slave?
 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.285
Most of the time they don't
have a name, most of the time

00:04:53.285 --> 00:04:55.540
they'd say one or two things to
Jesus;

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.850
one of the longest
conversations with Jesus that we

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.689
have with another character is
precisely the Syrophoenician

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:05.918
woman you've read about,
where, you remember she comes

00:05:05.918 --> 00:05:08.040
and says she wants her daughter
to be healed,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.660
and she's not a Jew,
and so Jesus says,

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.783
it's not right to take bread
from the children's mouths and

00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:18.389
throw it to the dogs,
calling her a dog.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.024
And undeterred she says,
yes, but the dogs get to eat

00:05:22.024 --> 00:05:25.028
the crumbs from under the
master's table.

00:05:25.028 --> 00:05:28.634
That's one of the longest
dialogues that Jesus has with

00:05:28.634 --> 00:05:30.769
another person,
not his disciple,

00:05:30.769 --> 00:05:32.639
in the synoptic Gospels.
 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.940
Very different when you get to
the Gospel of John.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.490
We have this scene we'll go to
in a minute where Jesus has as

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.740
whole chapter talking to
Nicodemus,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.411
we're told who Nicodemus is,
we're told a little bit about

00:05:43.411 --> 00:05:44.619
him,
and then Jesus has a

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:45.629
conversation with him.
 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.512
We have a whole scene in which
Jesus is talking to this woman

00:05:49.512 --> 00:05:51.649
at the well, a Samaritan woman.
 

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:53.646
We know more about this woman
then we know about just about

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:54.990
anybody else in the synoptic
Gospels.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.057
We know that she's had five
husbands, how many people do we

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:00.319
know that about?
 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:03.206
We know that she's a Samaritan,
we know where she lives,

00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:05.410
we know that she goes out to
draw water.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.906
So there are a lot of places in
the Gospel of John where

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:14.569
characters actually look much
more lifelike and filled out

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.639
than they have been in the
Gospels that we've read so far.

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.310
This lecture is going to focus
on the Gospel of John,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.653
but as you've already figured
out, one of the main themes of

00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:28.485
the course is how were the
different forms of early

00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:30.980
Christianity different from one
another?

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.279
It wasn't just one movement.
 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:37.014
It's not like some new religion
just sprang out of the earth or

00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:38.160
fell from heaven.
 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.668
So one of the themes of the
course has been to look at the

00:06:40.668 --> 00:06:41.459
different kinds.
 

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:43.845
And the Gospel of John and in
the letters of John--I,

00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:46.322
II and III John which we'll
talk about next time--are a

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.699
wonderful example of this.
 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:50.350
In fact, if you look at the
syllabus,

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.526
today's lecture constitutes a
certain shift in the syllabus

00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:56.934
because--
although I am talking about a

00:06:56.934 --> 00:06:59.550
Gospel and I have been talking
about Gospels--

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.456
I put a little subheading under
this week that's sort of like

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:07.362
the spread of Christianity and
how different Christian groups

00:07:07.362 --> 00:07:08.600
look different.
 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.790
We talked about that with the
Book of Acts last time,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.899
but this time what we're going
to do is we're going to use

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:17.473
Johannine Christianity,
just one of the fancy scholarly

00:07:17.473 --> 00:07:17.959
words.
 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.910
This refers to different kinds
of John Christianity.

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.307
We've got the Gospel of John
and we have three letters of

00:07:29.307 --> 00:07:31.086
John,
and they are similar enough

00:07:31.086 --> 00:07:34.225
although it's quite debatable
whether they're all written by

00:07:34.225 --> 00:07:36.322
the same person,
we'll talk about that when we

00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:37.319
get to the letters of John.
 

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:40.533
They're similar enough in their
writing style and in their

00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:43.204
terminology,
and in their theological themes

00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:46.209
that we believe that all four of
these documents,

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:48.541
the Gospel of John,
I, and II, and III John

00:07:48.541 --> 00:07:51.762
represent one form of early
Christianity and we're going to

00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:55.204
call that Johannine Christianity
or somebody might pronounce it

00:07:55.204 --> 00:07:57.839
Johannine Christianity,
it's the same thing;

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:59.899
so this lecture's going to
focus on that.

00:07:59.899 --> 00:08:02.607
Let's first look at the
narrative differences in the

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:03.509
Gospel of John.
 

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:05.350
I hope you noticed this when
you were reading through it.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.321
First, there's this prologue
that I started reading at the

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:09.990
very beginning of the lecture.
 

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:13.488
It has several major themes
that will occur throughout the

00:08:13.488 --> 00:08:16.560
Gospel, and it's just packed
into this prologue.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.100
There's first Jesus'
pre-existence.

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.302
In no other Gospel do we get
the idea that Jesus existed

00:08:25.302 --> 00:08:27.100
before his birth.
 

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.845
That's counterintuitive to a
lot of us because whether you're

00:08:30.845 --> 00:08:34.529
a Christian or not a Christian
you're used to thinking about

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:38.524
Jesus as an eternal divine being
who becomes incarnate as a human

00:08:38.524 --> 00:08:40.460
being but always existed.
 

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:42.962
That's not in the other Gospels
if you noticed,

00:08:42.962 --> 00:08:45.629
but it's definitely here in the
Gospel of John.

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:48.770
So we get the pre-existence of
Jesus and his divinity,

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.549
right there in the prologue.
 

00:08:50.549 --> 00:08:54.461
You get this theme of life;
you get this theme of light and

00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:55.269
darkness.
 

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:57.519
Jesus comes from light,
he comes into darkness,

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.211
the darkness doesn't receive
him, he brings light to his

00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:02.610
followers, there's the coming
into the world.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.634
The world is not simply the
physical world that you and I

00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:12.389
know, it's the cosmos,
the Greek word where we get the

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:15.710
word cosmology,
all the universe.

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:20.318
Jesus comes into the cosmos,
so the cosmos as a dark enemy

00:09:20.318 --> 00:09:25.251
place in which Jesus invades it
in a sense is one of the major

00:09:25.251 --> 00:09:30.590
themes of the Gospels that you
get right here in the prologue.

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.232
The world is a place of enmity,
the world hates Jesus,

00:09:34.232 --> 00:09:38.427
the world hates the disciples,
the world hates you if you're a

00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:39.940
follower of Jesus.
 

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.852
Birth from God,
so there's this idea that

00:09:42.852 --> 00:09:44.820
people are born from God.
 

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.504
Son and father linkage,
over and over again,

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:52.360
God is Jesus' father in the
Gospel of John.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.336
That's true in some of the
other Gospels but it's just much

00:09:55.336 --> 00:09:56.980
more so in the Gospel of John.
 

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.172
John the Baptist as the lesser
of the two is introduced right

00:10:01.172 --> 00:10:02.428
in the prologue.
 

00:10:02.428 --> 00:10:05.019
We don't take a while to get to
John,

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:07.769
we have John the Baptist right
in verse 6,

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:10.820
"There was a man sent from
God whose name was John,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.830
he came as a witness to testify
to the light so that all might

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.668
believe in him.
 

00:10:14.668 --> 00:10:16.730
He himself was not the
light."

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.232
This guy wants you to know from
the very beginning John the

00:10:20.232 --> 00:10:23.434
Baptist is not Jesus' equal,
he's a secondary witness,

00:10:23.434 --> 00:10:25.548
just so you don't get confused.
 

00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:29.197
There's the idea that "the
law comes from Moses but grace

00:10:29.197 --> 00:10:31.230
and truth come from Jesus."
 

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.693
And there is the emphasis on
seeing and knowing as we'll talk

00:10:34.693 --> 00:10:38.389
about later when I hit some of
the major themes of the Gospel;

00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:41.918
seeing and knowing are two
definite themes for the Gospel

00:10:41.918 --> 00:10:45.764
of John and it's all right there
wrapped up in the prologue to

00:10:45.764 --> 00:10:46.710
the Gospel.
 

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.190
John is different from anything
else because in this very,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.090
very elaborately constructed
poetic sounding,

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.590
almost philosophical sounding
prologue,

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.001
you get lots of the major
themes of the Gospel just laid

00:10:58.001 --> 00:11:00.715
out for you,
so that's a narrative

00:11:00.715 --> 00:11:01.889
difference.
 

00:11:01.889 --> 00:11:05.505
Another major narrative
difference is the relationship

00:11:05.505 --> 00:11:07.690
of Jesus and John the Baptist.
 

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.383
In the synoptic Gospels,
Jesus' ministry does not begin

00:11:12.383 --> 00:11:14.730
until the arrest of John.
 

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.940
Did you notice this?
 

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.250
Jesus goes to John the Baptist
to be baptized,

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.850
and it looks like Jesus,
in a sense,

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:24.339
is almost a disciple of John,
although the Gospel writers try

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:27.288
not to tell it that way,
but Jesus doesn't start his own

00:11:27.288 --> 00:11:30.590
preaching ministry and his own
healing ministry until the

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.950
ministry of John the Baptist is
over.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.847
For the synoptic Gospels,
John the Baptist's ministry

00:11:35.847 --> 00:11:38.356
comes here, John the Baptist's
ministry stops,

00:11:38.356 --> 00:11:40.029
Jesus' starts,
very clear.

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:43.061
In the Gospel of John that's
not the way it is,

00:11:43.061 --> 00:11:45.830
their two ministries overlap
each other.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.629
So, for example,
sometimes John the Baptist is

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:52.298
baptizing and the Gospel of John
tells us that Jesus and his

00:11:52.298 --> 00:11:55.595
disciples are baptizing in
another part of the Jordan.

00:11:55.595 --> 00:11:56.279
What?
 

00:11:56.279 --> 00:11:58.779
We don't hear anything like
that in the other Gospels.

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:01.474
Jesus and his disciples over
here in another part of the

00:12:01.474 --> 00:12:04.364
Jordan baptizing their disciples
while John is baptizing his

00:12:04.364 --> 00:12:05.048
disciples?
 

00:12:05.048 --> 00:12:08.520
And then sometimes John's
disciples leave John and go over

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.712
and join Jesus,
and then there's some

00:12:10.712 --> 00:12:12.480
discussions between them.
 

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.720
Sometimes John--the
disciples--John the Baptist's

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.839
disciples come and ask Jesus'
disciples, what does your master

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:22.269
do about this,
or this, or that?

00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:25.370
There's an overlap of the two
ministries that you get in the

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.840
Gospel of John and you don't get
it at all in the other Gospels.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.100
Another big difference,
Judea and Galilee.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.629
If all you had were the first
three Gospels,

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:40.043
the ideas you would have was
that Jesus' entire ministry took

00:12:40.043 --> 00:12:44.529
place basically in Galilee until
the last part of his life.

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:48.302
And then he journeys to
Jerusalem, and according to the

00:12:48.302 --> 00:12:52.631
Gospels, he's only basically in
Jerusalem for one week and then

00:12:52.631 --> 00:12:53.960
he's crucified.
 

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.639
That's not the way it is in the
Gospel of John.

00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:02.082
In fact, did any of you notice,
where is the cleansing of the

00:13:02.082 --> 00:13:07.798
temple incident in the synoptic
Gospels, when does it happen?

00:13:07.798 --> 00:13:12.551
Wake up, when does the
cleansing of the temple incident

00:13:12.551 --> 00:13:15.453
happen in Matthew,
Mark, and Luke,

00:13:15.453 --> 00:13:17.389
all three of them?
 

00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:22.197
I'm sorry, at the end,
right on like maybe Wednesday

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:24.460
before he is executed.
 

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.192
It happens the last week of his
life right before he is

00:13:27.192 --> 00:13:27.750
arrested.
 

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.581
In fact, the Gospels present
that as maybe one of the reasons

00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:31.620
that he is arrested.
 

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.559
When does it happen in the
Gospel of John?

00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:35.679
Chapter 2.
 

00:13:35.679 --> 00:13:37.440
Is it 2?
 

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.230
I can't remember is it really
two?

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.129
Okay, yes it happens at the
very beginning of the Gospel.

00:13:44.129 --> 00:13:45.669
I couldn't remember exactly
what chapter,

00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:45.940
good.
 

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.441
The cleansing of the temple
happens at the beginning of the

00:13:49.441 --> 00:13:52.399
Gospel of John,
not the end like in the others.

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:57.370
The length of Jesus' ministry,
in the synoptic Gospels,

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.009
if all you have is synoptic
Gospels,

00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:02.735
it would like the ministry of
Jesus probably lasted maybe a

00:14:02.735 --> 00:14:05.190
year,
not much more than that.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.248
There's just no indication of
how long it takes but he goes to

00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:11.307
Jerusalem only one time for the
Passover and that's at the end

00:14:11.307 --> 00:14:12.110
of his life.
 

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.335
In the Gospel of John there are
three different mentions of

00:14:16.335 --> 00:14:17.210
Passovers.
 

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.128
There's the Passover in 2:13,
this is when he goes up to

00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:24.120
Jerusalem and cleanses the
temple there.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:27.730
There's another Passover
mentioned in 6:4,

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.658
and there's another Passover
mentioned in 13:1,

00:14:31.658 --> 00:14:34.365
that is the Passover that's at
the end of his life when he's

00:14:34.365 --> 00:14:34.870
arrested.
 

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:37.923
There's three Passovers that
occur in Jesus' ministry

00:14:37.923 --> 00:14:39.918
according to the Gospel of John.
 

00:14:39.918 --> 00:14:44.222
Have you ever heard the
tradition that Jesus was thirty

00:14:44.222 --> 00:14:47.570
years old when he started his
ministry,

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:50.379
and his ministry lasted three
years,

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:52.789
so he would have been dead at
thirty-three?

00:14:52.789 --> 00:14:53.960
You may have heard that.
 

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.210
Do you know how people got that
tradition?

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.509
It's not in the Bible anywhere.
 

00:14:57.509 --> 00:15:02.001
They get the thirty year old
idea from reading some passages

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:06.190
in Luke and the idea of when he
started his ministry.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.798
They get the three years from
reading the Gospel of John.

00:15:09.798 --> 00:15:12.822
Notice how they've taken one
little detail about Jesus' life

00:15:12.822 --> 00:15:14.942
from Luke,
a different detail from John,

00:15:14.942 --> 00:15:17.750
they combined them together to
give you the tradition,

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.340
but no Gospel actually has that
teaching in it.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.677
Christians have pulled these
Gospel--the details from the

00:15:24.677 --> 00:15:25.808
Gospels together.
 

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:29.025
That's because John's the only
one that indicates that

00:15:29.025 --> 00:15:32.544
according to his reckoning
Jesus' ministry covered at least

00:15:32.544 --> 00:15:35.630
three Passovers,
the other Gospels don't have

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.019
that.
 

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:40.399
Jesus' parents and hometown
according to Matthew,

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:44.139
Jesus' family is simply from
Bethlehem.

00:15:44.139 --> 00:15:46.518
That's where they start off,
that's where they end up,

00:15:46.518 --> 00:15:48.941
so Jesus' family is from
Bethlehem, Jesus later goes to

00:15:48.941 --> 00:15:49.480
Galilee.
 

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.246
According to the Gospel of
Luke, Jesus' family is from

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:56.355
Galilee,
they go to Bethlehem only for

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:59.284
the census,
and then a month or so after

00:15:59.284 --> 00:16:01.710
the birth they go back to
Galilee,

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.308
so we've got differences right
there.

00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:05.932
Matthew simply has Jesus'
family from Judea in the

00:16:05.932 --> 00:16:08.984
beginning, and they end up
moving to Galilee after they go

00:16:08.984 --> 00:16:09.678
to Egypt.
 

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:12.298
Luke has them from Galilee,
go to Judea,

00:16:12.298 --> 00:16:13.710
go back to Galilee.
 

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:17.389
John doesn't have anything
about this Bethlehem birth.

00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:22.417
In fact he has--in 7:31 people
say, "How can you be the

00:16:22.417 --> 00:16:23.269
Messiah?
 

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:25.980
Who says the Messiah is
supposed to come from Galilee?

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.663
The Messiah doesn't come from
Galilee, the Messiah's supposed

00:16:28.663 --> 00:16:30.048
to come from Bethlehem."
 

00:16:30.048 --> 00:16:32.363
The writer of the Gospel of
John, wouldn't this be a great

00:16:32.363 --> 00:16:34.751
time if he could just say,
oh these stupid Jews,

00:16:34.751 --> 00:16:37.985
they don't know that Jesus
actually was born in Bethlehem

00:16:37.985 --> 00:16:39.950
and therefore he is from Judea.
 

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.320
He doesn't say anything like
that.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.698
He just allows the reader,
you the reader,

00:16:43.698 --> 00:16:47.008
to believe that Jesus really
was from Galilee and you know

00:16:47.008 --> 00:16:48.750
what, that doesn't matter.
 

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.722
They must have gotten it wrong,
they must not have thought that

00:16:52.722 --> 00:16:56.440
the Messiah could actually come
from Galilee but he can.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.586
Again, the Gospel of John
different in its narrative

00:16:59.586 --> 00:17:00.389
structures.
 

00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:03.833
The Last Supper,
the Last Supper in the synoptic

00:17:03.833 --> 00:17:05.960
Gospels is a Passover meal.
 

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.029
The Last Supper in John is not
a Passover meal.

00:17:13.078 --> 00:17:16.010
In fact, also,
the Last Supper is not the

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.868
institution of the Eucharist in
John.

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:22.815
In Christian churches we
observe the mass or the

00:17:22.815 --> 00:17:26.219
Eucharist and we say,
Jesus established this in his

00:17:26.219 --> 00:17:29.287
Last Supper with his disciples,
"do this in memory of

00:17:29.287 --> 00:17:29.858
me."
 

00:17:29.858 --> 00:17:33.930
That goes back to Matthew,
Mark, and Luke.

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:35.900
The Gospel of John doesn't have
that.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.804
There's no place in the Gospel
of John where Jesus initiates

00:17:38.804 --> 00:17:39.690
the Last Supper.
 

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.608
He doesn't take the cup,
he doesn't take the wine,

00:17:41.608 --> 00:17:42.980
and say, do this in memory of
me.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.358
What happens at the Last Supper
in the Gospel of John?

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:48.454
He has a foot washing,
there's a foot washing

00:17:48.454 --> 00:17:49.230
ceremony.
 

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.098
Notice again what Christian
tradition has done here.

00:17:52.098 --> 00:17:56.154
Any of you know what Maundy
Thursday means in Christian

00:17:56.154 --> 00:17:56.980
churches?
 

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:01.440
Maundy Thursday refers to the
Thursday before Good Friday,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.220
which is the Friday before
Easter, and on Good Friday

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.710
according to the tradition Jesus
was executed.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:12.032
The Thursday night before is
when he has the Last Supper with

00:18:12.032 --> 00:18:12.920
his disciples.
 

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.930
Now in many Christian churches,
on the Thursday before Easter,

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.828
not only will they have the
Eucharist service--

00:18:18.828 --> 00:18:21.541
or a communion service,
but they'll also have a foot

00:18:21.541 --> 00:18:22.500
washing service.
 

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.480
At the church where I go the
priests,

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.317
the different priests will
actually get down on their hands

00:18:27.317 --> 00:18:30.351
and knees and put towels around
themselves and wash the feet of

00:18:30.351 --> 00:18:33.432
anybody in the church who comes
forward on Thursday night before

00:18:33.432 --> 00:18:34.068
Easter.
 

00:18:34.068 --> 00:18:38.250
They're doing that in imitation
of Jesus' foot washing of his

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.970
disciples at the Last Supper in
John.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:43.830
But notice what we've done
here, again Christians have

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.068
combined the Last Supper and the
Eucharist establishment,

00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:50.715
from the synoptic Gospels,
with the foot washing service

00:18:50.715 --> 00:18:54.430
from the Gospel of John and
they've put them together.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:57.288
But they weren't together in
our Bible, they were in two

00:18:57.288 --> 00:18:58.380
separate documents.
 

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.170
The arrest is also very
different in the synoptic

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:02.960
Gospels.
 

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.076
In the Synoptic Gospels they
come to arrest Jesus and they

00:19:06.076 --> 00:19:08.430
just arrest him and there's a
few things.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.528
In the Gospel of John there's
this funny,

00:19:10.528 --> 00:19:12.491
funny, funny scene,
it's actually very humorous

00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:14.710
where they come up with the
swords and the clubs,

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.328
it's in the middle of the night
in the garden,

00:19:16.328 --> 00:19:18.618
and they come up to Jesus and
Jesus says,

00:19:18.618 --> 00:19:19.750
who are you looking for,
and they say,

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.144
Jesus of Nazareth,
and Jesus says,

00:19:21.144 --> 00:19:22.502
I am he,
and they all fall over on the

00:19:22.502 --> 00:19:22.750
ground.
 

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:26.058
It's like an Indiana Jones
thing.

00:19:26.058 --> 00:19:28.527
The power of him saying this
knocks them all over,

00:19:28.527 --> 00:19:31.246
and they get up and do it
again, and they all fall over

00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:31.750
again.
 

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.246
The whole scene of the arrest
of Jesus is very different in

00:19:34.246 --> 00:19:35.150
the Gospel of John.
 

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.387
At his trial,
in the Synoptic Gospels,

00:19:38.387 --> 00:19:40.838
Jesus says almost nothing.
 

00:19:40.838 --> 00:19:43.097
Some of the Synoptics say he
said nothing,

00:19:43.097 --> 00:19:45.962
other Synoptics say he said
something, but he's very,

00:19:45.962 --> 00:19:46.788
very quiet.
 

00:19:46.788 --> 00:19:49.830
In the Gospel of John he just
carries on this whole

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.420
philosophical discussion with
Pilate about what is truth.

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:58.000
He just keeps talking and
talking, very different scene.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.608
On the crucifixion there's some
differences.

00:20:00.608 --> 00:20:03.410
Remember I'm here rehearsing
just narrative differences

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.640
between the first three Gospels
and John.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.634
These are places where just the
story is different in its

00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:09.170
details.
 

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:13.992
According to the first three
Gospels, the crucifixion takes

00:20:13.992 --> 00:20:17.068
place on the first day of
Passover.

00:20:17.068 --> 00:20:20.056
The Thursday night
supper--remember in Jewish

00:20:20.056 --> 00:20:23.210
calendar reckoning,
a day begins at sundown,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:27.430
so on sundown of Thursday night
that's beginning of Friday,

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:30.603
and in the Synoptic Gospels
that's the beginning of the

00:20:30.603 --> 00:20:31.250
Passover.
 

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.731
So they wait until sundown and
they have the Passover meal

00:20:34.731 --> 00:20:37.970
Thursday night and that's the
beginning of Friday,

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.559
the first day of Passover,
and it's on the Friday the

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:43.348
first day of Passover that Jesus
is actually executed.

00:20:43.348 --> 00:20:46.338
That's not the way it is in the
Gospel of John.

00:20:46.338 --> 00:20:49.108
Read the execution narrative in
the Gospel of John.

00:20:49.108 --> 00:20:52.953
According to the Gospel of
John, Jesus is not crucified on

00:20:52.953 --> 00:20:57.508
the first day of Passover,
he's crucified on the day

00:20:57.508 --> 00:21:00.630
before Passover,
and how do we know that?

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.528
Because it says when they were
crucifying him was the same time

00:21:04.528 --> 00:21:07.608
they were slaughtering the lambs
in the temple.

00:21:07.608 --> 00:21:10.470
Notice, it's a wonderful little
symbolism, right?

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:14.450
Right when Jesus is being
slaughtered, the lambs for the

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.200
Passover meal are being
slaughtered.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.059
Because what you would do of
course if you were a Jew in

00:21:19.059 --> 00:21:22.105
Jerusalem,
you would take your lamb to the

00:21:22.105 --> 00:21:25.441
priest on Thursday,
you'd have them slaughter it,

00:21:25.441 --> 00:21:28.182
pour out the blood,
they'd take a little bit of it,

00:21:28.182 --> 00:21:30.558
then you'd take it back home to
your family,

00:21:30.558 --> 00:21:32.519
or to the hotel where you're
staying,

00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:34.108
or to the picnic ground where
you're staying,

00:21:34.108 --> 00:21:36.564
and you cook your lamb,
and that's where you have the

00:21:36.564 --> 00:21:37.318
Passover meal.
 

00:21:37.318 --> 00:21:40.567
According to the Gospel of
John, Jesus is executed at the

00:21:40.567 --> 00:21:43.410
same time that they're
slaughtering the lambs,

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.237
which means he's not executed
on the day of Passover but the

00:21:46.237 --> 00:21:49.108
day before Passover,
completely different.

00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:52.973
The last big narrative
difference with the Gospel of

00:21:52.973 --> 00:21:57.900
John from the synoptics is this
guy named the beloved disciple.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.400
Who the hell is the beloved
disciple?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.660
We don't know who he is.
 

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.750
According to Dan Brown and
the--what's that awful book?

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.538
The Da Vinci Code,
right--according to The Da

00:22:10.538 --> 00:22:13.327
Vinci Code the beloved
disciple is actually a girl,

00:22:13.327 --> 00:22:14.308
Mary Magdalene.
 

00:22:14.308 --> 00:22:17.258
I guess it's because he
couldn't believe that Jesus

00:22:17.258 --> 00:22:20.618
could be attracted to a guy,
so he had to invent a girl to

00:22:20.618 --> 00:22:22.269
be the beloved disciple.
 

00:22:22.269 --> 00:22:27.150
Heterosexist as modern
novelists are.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.394
No, the beloved disciple is a
man and we don't even know who

00:22:31.394 --> 00:22:31.970
he is.
 

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:34.880
He's Jesus' favorite disciple
in the Gospel of John.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.137
This character doesn't exist in
the other Gospels,

00:22:39.137 --> 00:22:41.048
he's just not there.
 

00:22:41.048 --> 00:22:43.368
Now tradition has said who is
the beloved disciple?

00:22:43.368 --> 00:22:45.842
Well it's the--John,
son of Zebedee,

00:22:45.842 --> 00:22:48.880
younger brother of James,
son of Zebedee.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.291
If you go to the art gallery,
which you will later in the

00:22:51.291 --> 00:22:52.913
semester,
we're all going to take a tour

00:22:52.913 --> 00:22:55.778
of the Yale Art Gallery,
you'll see that when John son

00:22:55.778 --> 00:22:59.595
of Zebedee is depicted in art
he's always the depicted as a

00:22:59.595 --> 00:23:02.516
young man without a beard,
very beautiful,

00:23:02.516 --> 00:23:06.304
almost feminine looking because
he's sort of representing the

00:23:06.304 --> 00:23:07.818
boy that Jesus loved.
 

00:23:07.818 --> 00:23:11.122
Well, we don't know that it was
John, the Gospel of John doesn't

00:23:11.122 --> 00:23:13.429
tell us it was John,
it just tells it was the

00:23:13.429 --> 00:23:14.528
beloved disciple.
 

00:23:14.528 --> 00:23:16.269
Most scholars are just willing
to say,

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:20.172
whoever this beloved disciple
was, and maybe it was just a

00:23:20.172 --> 00:23:23.868
figment of the literary
pretentions of this writer,

00:23:23.868 --> 00:23:26.221
maybe there was no historical
beloved disciple,

00:23:26.221 --> 00:23:27.038
we don't know.
 

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:29.902
But he's a strong character in
this Gospel and he doesn't

00:23:29.902 --> 00:23:32.048
appear anyplace else but in this
Gospel.

00:23:32.048 --> 00:23:34.566
Notice in all those ways,
the Gospel of John is very

00:23:34.566 --> 00:23:36.588
different from the other three
Gospels.

00:23:36.588 --> 00:23:41.308
That in itself makes it really
interesting to study.

00:23:41.308 --> 00:23:45.933
It opens up a window for us of
an entirely different kind of

00:23:45.933 --> 00:23:50.558
early Christianity than we would
have if we didn't have this

00:23:50.558 --> 00:23:54.519
Gospel,
so it's really wonderful.

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:57.646
Some major Johannine themes,
I'm going to go through this

00:23:57.646 --> 00:24:00.829
pretty quickly because,
if you just take a concordance

00:24:00.829 --> 00:24:03.575
and look up these terms,
you can look at all the

00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:04.548
different places.
 

00:24:04.548 --> 00:24:08.288
First, notice that some of
these main themes,

00:24:08.288 --> 00:24:10.036
I've already mentioned some of
them when I was talking about

00:24:10.036 --> 00:24:12.330
the prologue,
these main themes occur over

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:16.364
and over and over again like the
ringing of bells in the Gospel

00:24:16.364 --> 00:24:17.078
of John.
 

00:24:17.078 --> 00:24:19.848
Every once in a while you'll
see one in one chapter,

00:24:19.848 --> 00:24:21.803
and then you might not hear
until the next chapter or a few

00:24:21.803 --> 00:24:24.368
chapters later,
but they'll just keep coming up.

00:24:24.368 --> 00:24:27.519
This author hits you over the
head several times throughout

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:30.400
the Gospel with the same themes
coming back at you.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:35.460
One of them is the descending
and ascending redeemer figure.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:41.825
Jesus is the one who came down
from above who's going up,

00:24:41.825 --> 00:24:43.529
look at 1:51.
 

00:24:43.529 --> 00:24:47.155
Now we're going to run like
bunnies through the text here so

00:24:47.155 --> 00:24:49.368
get your text out and be
prepared.

00:24:49.368 --> 00:24:53.281
Lick your finger,
come on lick your finger,

00:24:53.281 --> 00:24:58.220
you're not going to get sick,
it's your own finger.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.944
1:51, "And he said to him,
very truly I tell you,

00:25:01.944 --> 00:25:04.989
you will see heaven open and
the angels of God ascending and

00:25:04.989 --> 00:25:07.776
descending upon the Son of
Man," so the angels are

00:25:07.776 --> 00:25:08.548
ascending.
 

00:25:08.548 --> 00:25:12.326
Look at 3:13,
"No one has ascended into

00:25:12.326 --> 00:25:16.453
heaven except the one who
descended from heaven,

00:25:16.453 --> 00:25:18.650
the Son of Man."
 

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.795
Look at 3:31,
"The one who comes from

00:25:22.795 --> 00:25:26.058
above is above all,
the one who is of the earth

00:25:26.058 --> 00:25:28.140
belongs to the earth and speaks
about earthly things.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.303
The one who comes from heaven
is above all,"

00:25:33.303 --> 00:25:38.358
and I could go on,
1:32,6:38,6:41,6:58,20:17.

00:25:38.358 --> 00:25:41.611
Just look up this coming and
rising, you look up these words

00:25:41.611 --> 00:25:45.082
in a concordance and you'll find
they occur over and over in the

00:25:45.082 --> 00:25:46.130
Gospel of John.
 

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:52.443
Very similar to that one is the
theme of being lifted up,

00:25:52.443 --> 00:25:56.730
so Jesus in 3:14,
in 12:32, in 8:28.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.021
You don't need to remember
these numbers because you can

00:25:59.021 --> 00:26:01.481
look at a concordance and you
can read this and you can just

00:26:01.481 --> 00:26:03.898
mark out in the margins of your
Bible whenever you see this

00:26:03.898 --> 00:26:05.942
idea,
in all of those Jesus is the

00:26:05.942 --> 00:26:07.430
one who will be lifted up.
 

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.403
This is a puzzle,
one of the things that we'll

00:26:09.403 --> 00:26:11.377
find is that the Gospel of John
likes puzzles,

00:26:11.377 --> 00:26:12.298
he likes riddles.
 

00:26:12.298 --> 00:26:15.655
So what does this mean when
Jesus talks about the Son of Man

00:26:15.655 --> 00:26:16.680
being lifted up?
 

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.880
Does it mean his ascension into
heaven?

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:23.548
Does it mean his resurrection
from the dead?

00:26:23.548 --> 00:26:26.818
Does it mean his being put on a
cross,

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:29.288
because when you nail somebody
on the cross you did it on the

00:26:29.288 --> 00:26:31.140
ground and then you put them up
like this,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.173
so does the lifting up of the
Son of Man refer to his

00:26:34.173 --> 00:26:34.990
crucifixion?
 

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.890
or his resurrection?
 

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:40.150
or his ascension going back to
the Father?

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.792
It's a puzzle we're never told
exactly and that's one of the

00:26:42.792 --> 00:26:45.527
wonderful things about this text
is that it plays with you all

00:26:45.527 --> 00:26:46.108
the time.
 

00:26:46.108 --> 00:26:48.919
It wants you to wonder about
what's being meant here,

00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:52.323
so that lifted up is one of the
themes that goes along with this

00:26:52.323 --> 00:26:53.890
going up and coming down.
 

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:55.440
And then another part of that
theme--

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.190
see these themes get
complicated is when Jesus says,

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:02.986
"Everyone who comes to me
when I am lifted up I will lift

00:27:02.986 --> 00:27:07.336
up," so Jesus says,
he will lift up people who are

00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:08.450
his disciples.
 

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:11.200
This going up and coming down
is all the way through the

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.349
Gospel, so that's one of the
main themes.

00:27:13.349 --> 00:27:16.092
I mentioned seeing;
we're going to run like bunnies

00:27:16.092 --> 00:27:16.970
through the text.
 

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.868
1:18: "No one has ever
seen God.

00:27:21.868 --> 00:27:24.538
It is God the only Son who is
close to the Father's heart who

00:27:24.538 --> 00:27:25.740
has made him known."
 

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:29.319
Now see I should have told you,
knowing is another theme

00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:30.801
there,
we got two themes right in the

00:27:30.801 --> 00:27:32.505
same verse,
seeing and knowing and the

00:27:32.505 --> 00:27:35.619
relationship between seeing and
knowing in the Gospel of John is

00:27:35.619 --> 00:27:36.509
also difficult.
 

00:27:36.509 --> 00:27:41.723
It's not always clear,
do you know by seeing or does

00:27:41.723 --> 00:27:46.529
seeing lead to an inadequate
form of knowing?

00:27:46.529 --> 00:27:50.128
These are big exegetical
problems that the Gospel of John

00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:52.250
poses and scholars argue about.
 

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.295
Look at 1:34,
"And I myself have seen

00:27:55.295 --> 00:27:59.380
and have testified that this is
the Son of God."

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:00.690
I have seen.
 

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:04.499
Look at 1:39,
"He came to them,

00:28:04.499 --> 00:28:06.348
'Come and see.'
 

00:28:06.348 --> 00:28:08.740
And they came and saw where he
was staying."

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.155
In other words,
just look in the concordance

00:28:11.155 --> 00:28:14.751
for every time you find the word
see, saw, seeing and you'll just

00:28:14.751 --> 00:28:16.548
find it over and over again.
 

00:28:16.548 --> 00:28:22.204
3:3,3:11,3:32,3:36,
several right there in chapter

00:28:22.204 --> 00:28:26.130
3, etcetera, etcetera,
etcetera.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:31.508
Again, it's always a little bit
difficult to figure out do you

00:28:31.508 --> 00:28:36.269
have to see to have faith in the
Gospel of John or,

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:39.125
because it sounds like one
place toward the end of Gospel

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:42.396
Jesus says,
"Blessed are those who

00:28:42.396 --> 00:28:45.240
believe without seeing."
 

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.910
He says to Thomas,
"Blessed are you,

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:48.246
you saw and so you
believe,"

00:28:48.246 --> 00:28:49.038
so that's okay.
 

00:28:49.038 --> 00:28:51.910
"Blessed are those who
have not seen and believe."

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:56.558
Is seeing an inadequate form of
faith?

00:28:56.558 --> 00:29:00.184
Is it better to have faith
without seeing or is seeing

00:29:00.184 --> 00:29:01.690
necessary for faith?
 

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.048
It's a problem.
 

00:29:03.048 --> 00:29:05.289
I already mentioned knowing but
I could do the same kind of

00:29:05.289 --> 00:29:05.598
thing.
 

00:29:05.598 --> 00:29:12.269
1:18,8:55,14:17,
over and over again.

00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:16.160
Where Jesus came from and where
Jesus is going is a major theme.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:20.205
With the Jews often he'll say,
you can't go where I'm going,

00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:23.430
and they say,
what is he talking about going?

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.990
Is he going to go out to the
Greeks and preach to the Greeks?

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:27.519
Is he going to go back to
Galilee?

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:28.848
What does he mean, he's going?
 

00:29:28.848 --> 00:29:32.608
People are always
misunderstanding this.

00:29:32.608 --> 00:29:37.470
One of the other points is
signs, what are signs in the

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.000
Gospel of John?
 

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.712
Notice the Gospel of John has
other differences that I haven't

00:29:41.712 --> 00:29:42.981
even mentioned;
for example,

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:45.077
remember in the Synoptic
Gospels there are lots of

00:29:45.077 --> 00:29:46.058
exorcisms of demons.
 

00:29:46.058 --> 00:29:49.798
Jesus is going around a lot
casting out demons from people,

00:29:49.798 --> 00:29:51.990
and the demons even confess
him.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:57.828
You know there's not one
exorcism in the Gospel of John.

00:29:57.828 --> 00:30:03.561
Jesus is not an exorcist in the
Gospel of John as he is in the

00:30:03.561 --> 00:30:05.630
other three Gospels.
 

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:07.009
Why is that?
 

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:10.307
Obviously this writer knew that
there were stories circulating

00:30:10.307 --> 00:30:12.308
around that Jesus cast out
demons,

00:30:12.308 --> 00:30:15.526
why does he not have Jesus
doing any casting out of demons

00:30:15.526 --> 00:30:16.430
in his Gospel?
 

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:21.278
I don't know.
 

00:30:21.278 --> 00:30:25.493
There's probably a dissertation
there somewhere if you can find

00:30:25.493 --> 00:30:26.308
an answer.
 

00:30:26.308 --> 00:30:31.003
Look at 2:11,
so one of the things is that in

00:30:31.003 --> 00:30:36.660
the other Gospels they talk
about Jesus' miracles,

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:40.182
his healings,
but the term preferred by this

00:30:40.182 --> 00:30:42.150
Gospel writer is sign.
 

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:44.618
He talks about the things Jesus
did as signs.

00:30:44.618 --> 00:30:46.515
Now there are not a lot of
them, Jesus doesn't do a whole

00:30:46.515 --> 00:30:47.868
lot of miracles in the Gospel of
John.

00:30:47.868 --> 00:30:50.440
He does some big important ones
that become famous,

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.880
for example,
turning water into wine,

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.961
which is of course,
every college student's

00:30:54.961 --> 00:30:56.348
favorite miracle of Jesus.
 

00:30:56.348 --> 00:30:59.554
If only he had turned it into
beer that might have been a

00:30:59.554 --> 00:31:03.028
little bit better right,
but Jesus is famous for turning

00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:05.118
water into wine,
one of his major miracles.

00:31:05.118 --> 00:31:07.082
It's only in the Gospel of
John, it's not in the other

00:31:07.082 --> 00:31:08.747
Gospels,
so some of Jesus' famous

00:31:08.747 --> 00:31:11.680
miracles are in the Gospel of
John but they're not called

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.900
miracles in John,
they're called signs.

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:19.058
Look at 2:11,
"Jesus did this,

00:31:19.058 --> 00:31:23.198
the first of his signs,"
this is turning the water into

00:31:23.198 --> 00:31:25.397
the wine,
"in Cana of Galilee and

00:31:25.397 --> 00:31:28.308
revealed his glory and the
disciples believed in him."

00:31:28.308 --> 00:31:30.390
Notice "the first of his
signs."

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:33.460
Let's look over it a little bit
4:54,

00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:42.541
"Now this was the second
sign that Jesus did after coming

00:31:42.541 --> 00:31:45.650
from Judea to Galilee,"
the second sign.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:49.178
This has actually led some
scholars to say that one of the

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:52.460
sources this writer may have had
is as signs book,

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.718
a collection of signs,
that is, miracles that Jesus

00:31:55.718 --> 00:31:56.108
did.
 

00:31:56.108 --> 00:31:59.743
Notice they're not just a
miracle that Jesus does and then

00:31:59.743 --> 00:32:00.509
casts off.
 

00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:03.576
I think that the author uses
the term "sign"

00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:06.932
because most of the time you
can actually do an exegesis of

00:32:06.932 --> 00:32:10.230
these signs narratives and they
have some kind of symbolic

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.038
meaning.
 

00:32:11.038 --> 00:32:15.541
The signs in the Gospel of John
are not just miracles to

00:32:15.541 --> 00:32:18.740
prove Jesus' power,
they seem to have some kind of

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.778
theological or symbolic meaning
imbedded into them also.

00:32:21.778 --> 00:32:24.253
The signs, again,
are one of the major themes of

00:32:24.253 --> 00:32:25.358
the Gospel of John.
 

00:32:25.358 --> 00:32:30.739
One of the most important
things that drives the Gospel of

00:32:30.739 --> 00:32:32.910
John is sectarianism.
 

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:35.369
What do I mean by sectarianism?
 

00:32:40.618 --> 00:32:46.134
According to sociology of
religion, a sect--it's not

00:32:46.134 --> 00:32:49.269
necessarily just an insult.
 

00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:52.163
In other words you don't just
say, you're just some member of

00:32:52.163 --> 00:32:55.154
some crazy little sect out there
handling snakes or doing other

00:32:55.154 --> 00:32:56.118
kinds of things.
 

00:32:56.118 --> 00:33:00.720
A sect is a sociological term
that refers to any group,

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.294
whether it's religious or not,
although we usually confuse

00:33:03.294 --> 00:33:06.624
this in religious contexts,
that considers itself very well

00:33:06.624 --> 00:33:08.788
cut off from the rest of
society.

00:33:08.788 --> 00:33:11.656
For example,
I grew up in a very,

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:15.960
very sectarian fundamentalist
church in Texas.

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.318
By sectarian I mean that we
basically believed that we in my

00:33:20.318 --> 00:33:23.568
church were the only ones going
to heaven.

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:25.835
In fact, we would call each
other "brother"

00:33:25.835 --> 00:33:28.012
or "sister,"
and you wouldn't even call a

00:33:28.012 --> 00:33:30.166
Baptist--
I mean we thought the Southern

00:33:30.166 --> 00:33:31.650
Baptist were going to hell.
 

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:35.814
That's how much we thought we
were the only ones --there was

00:33:35.814 --> 00:33:39.979
nobody who was right like we
were right so you'd called each

00:33:39.979 --> 00:33:41.250
other brother.
 

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.577
Brother Lamar,
all the old men in the church

00:33:43.577 --> 00:33:46.772
especially were called brother,
but you wouldn't call people

00:33:46.772 --> 00:33:48.940
brother who were outside that
group.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:52.779
We were the only Christians,
you had to be in our group,

00:33:52.779 --> 00:33:54.890
in fact people would even talk
about something like,

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:57.930
if you brought somebody to
church as a visitor,

00:33:57.930 --> 00:33:59.660
somebody might come up to you
and say,

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.990
well is she a member of the
church?

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.769
They didn't need to say our
church,

00:34:05.769 --> 00:34:07.945
or our denomination,
it was just "the

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:11.289
church" because "the
church" meant our church.

00:34:11.289 --> 00:34:15.925
This--what made this group a
sectarian group was we had very

00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:17.340
firm boundaries.
 

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:19.478
There were debates about
whether it was okay to marry

00:34:19.478 --> 00:34:20.590
outside of that boundary.
 

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:22.590
Could you actually marry a
Methodist?

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.496
Oh God no, and God help you,
a Roman Catholic,

00:34:27.496 --> 00:34:32.621
so the stronger the walls
between your group and

00:34:32.621 --> 00:34:38.619
outsiders, the more sectarian
your social group is.

00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:41.614
John's church seems to be a
very sectarian group,

00:34:41.614 --> 00:34:45.358
and that's one of the things
people have--why does he talk so

00:34:45.358 --> 00:34:47.230
much about dark and light?
 

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.320
These are stark divisions,
insiders,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.873
outsiders, up,
below, there are children of

00:34:51.873 --> 00:34:55.583
light and children of darkness,
there are children of God and

00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:56.659
children of Satan.
 

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.590
There's no in between,
there's no gray area,

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.920
you're either in or you're out,
so scholars define this by

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.260
talking about Johannine
sectarianism,

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.860
the insider-outsider divisions.
 

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.780
We're going to look at one
place where that comes up.

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.119
Look at chapter 9.
 

00:35:14.119 --> 00:35:16.945
I'm going to spend a little
more time with this chapter

00:35:16.945 --> 00:35:20.135
because some scholars have used
this to say what's going on in

00:35:20.135 --> 00:35:21.340
the Gospel of John.
 

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:26.041
So get Chapter 9,
get your Bibles out,

00:35:26.041 --> 00:35:29.599
you know I may lie to you.
 

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:34.170
This is a story about Jesus
healing a man born blind,

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.809
so I'm going to skip around
through it,

00:35:36.809 --> 00:35:42.280
but first he heals him and then
9:10,

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.820
they kept saying to him,
that is the surrounding people:

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.659
"Then how were your eyes
opened?"

00:35:46.659 --> 00:35:48.637
He answered,
"The man called Jesus made

00:35:48.637 --> 00:35:50.659
mud, spread it on my eyes,
and said to me.

00:35:50.659 --> 00:35:51.909
'Go to Siloam and wash.'
 

00:35:51.909 --> 00:35:53.940
Then I went and washed and
received my sight."

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.989
They said to him,
"Where is he?

00:35:55.989 --> 00:35:58.599
[Notice this "where is
he?"

00:35:58.599 --> 00:36:06.242
how do your eyes open?]
He said, "I do not know

00:36:06.242 --> 00:36:09.239
[know, know, know.
 

00:36:09.239 --> 00:36:13.476
I now see, see,
see--where, where,

00:36:13.476 --> 00:36:16.300
where is he?]."
 

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.300
"They brought him to the
Pharisees, the man who had

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:19.099
formerly been blind.
 

00:36:19.099 --> 00:36:20.300
Now it was the Sabbath day.
 

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.311
Now wait a minute,
this is verse 13 for crying out

00:36:22.311 --> 00:36:24.155
loud,
we've been 12 verses into this

00:36:24.155 --> 00:36:25.463
chapter,
into this story,

00:36:25.463 --> 00:36:28.375
and only at verse 13 are we
told that it's the Sabbath day,

00:36:28.375 --> 00:36:28.775
why not?
 

00:36:28.775 --> 00:36:29.579
Why is that?
 

00:36:29.579 --> 00:36:33.929
Well because apparently what
started out as a simple healing

00:36:33.929 --> 00:36:38.500
story this author has decided to
turn into a conflict story.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:40.559
Have you noticed that in a lot
of the stories of the Gospels,

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:43.400
some stories just seem to be
straightforward miracle stories,

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.849
other stories seem to be nature
miracles,

00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:50.440
like not just healings but
power over nature?

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.992
And then there are lots of
stories that are conflict

00:36:53.992 --> 00:36:54.690
stories.
 

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.202
That is you're told that
someone was healed but the real

00:36:57.202 --> 00:37:00.012
important part of the story,
was not just necessarily that

00:37:00.012 --> 00:37:02.893
they were healed but that they
were healed on the Sabbath and

00:37:02.893 --> 00:37:05.583
that starts a conflict between
Jesus and other Jews about

00:37:05.583 --> 00:37:07.650
what's permitted to do on the
Sabbath.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:11.197
By the time you get to verse 13
what started out as simply a

00:37:11.197 --> 00:37:13.452
healing story,
although it may have had

00:37:13.452 --> 00:37:15.842
symbolic meaning,
because the man's blind and he

00:37:15.842 --> 00:37:18.713
comes to see and those are big
important themes for the Gospel

00:37:18.713 --> 00:37:20.715
of John,
now it becomes a conflict story

00:37:20.715 --> 00:37:21.550
over the Sabbath.
 

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:28.690
He tells the story again to the
Pharisees in verse 17:

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:31.271
So they said again to the blind
man [this is the Pharisees],

00:37:31.271 --> 00:37:32.760
"What do you say about
him?

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.510
It was your eyes he
opened."

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.079
He said, "He is a
prophet."

00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:38.597
[That's important.]
The Jews did not believe [this

00:37:38.597 --> 00:37:40.806
is verse 18]
that he had been born blind and

00:37:40.806 --> 00:37:43.786
had received his sight until
they called the parents of the

00:37:43.786 --> 00:37:46.510
man who had received his sight
and asked them,

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:48.960
"Is this your son,
who you say was born blind?

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.610
How then does he see?"
 

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.657
His parents said,
"We know that this is our

00:37:52.657 --> 00:37:55.481
son, and that he was born blind;
but we do not know how it is

00:37:55.481 --> 00:37:57.686
that he now sees,
nor do we know who opened his

00:37:57.686 --> 00:37:58.070
eyes.
 

00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:59.289
Ask him;
he is of age.

00:37:59.289 --> 00:38:00.840
He will speak for himself."
 

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:06.286
His parents said this [this is
the narrator speaking now]

00:38:06.286 --> 00:38:10.079
because they were afraid of the
Jews.

00:38:10.079 --> 00:38:13.751
Now wait a minute,
all the people in this story

00:38:13.751 --> 00:38:14.630
are Jews.
 

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:18.447
Jesus is a Jew,
the blind man's a Jew,

00:38:18.447 --> 00:38:22.679
his parents are Jews,
they're all Jews.

00:38:22.679 --> 00:38:27.494
Why are we talking about some
people being afraid of "the

00:38:27.494 --> 00:38:28.518
Jews"?
 

00:38:28.518 --> 00:38:33.333
"For the Jews had already
agreed that anyone who confessed

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:38.460
Jesus to be the Messiah would be
put out of the synagogue."

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:43.652
Now I hate to tell you folks
but that's just outright

00:38:43.652 --> 00:38:45.250
anachronistic.
 

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:50.230
There was no movement going on
during the life of Jesus where

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.711
anybody that confessed Jesus to
be the Messiah would be

00:38:54.711 --> 00:38:57.949
excommunicated from the
synagogue,

00:38:57.949 --> 00:38:58.789
that just didn't happen.
 

00:38:58.789 --> 00:39:02.157
There were all kinds of people
who thought--the Messiah was

00:39:02.157 --> 00:39:02.679
around.
 

00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:05.516
There were debates about this
but you didn't have any

00:39:05.516 --> 00:39:07.699
synagogue rulers going around
saying,

00:39:07.699 --> 00:39:10.528
well, we're going to make a
rule, anybody who claims that

00:39:10.528 --> 00:39:13.510
Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah
will be excommunicated,

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.320
we'll take their union card
away from them,

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:20.159
they can't come to high holy
days, we will return their dues.

00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:23.210
It just wasn't going on.
 

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:28.835
Now it may have been going on
decades later when this guy

00:39:28.835 --> 00:39:31.550
wrote the Gospel you see.
 

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.679
Now we'll keep reading.
 

00:39:33.679 --> 00:39:36.690
What's going on here of course
is what you believe about Jesus

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.456
the Messiah has to do with
whether you will be allowed to

00:39:39.456 --> 00:39:40.739
stay in the synagogue.
 

00:39:40.739 --> 00:39:45.010
If you take Jesus to be just a
prophet you might be allowed to

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:45.500
stay.
 

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.309
If you confess he's the
Messiah, you'll be kicked out of

00:39:48.309 --> 00:39:50.454
the synagogue,
that's the basic conflict of

00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:51.170
the story.
 

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:55.440
We keep reading and they go
into more and more conflict,

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.500
look at verse 30,
"Then the man

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.090
answered,"
they're basically saying,

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.909
look we know Moses,
this guy can't be the Messiah,

00:40:02.909 --> 00:40:03.909
he must be wrong.
 

00:40:03.909 --> 00:40:06.304
The man answered,
"Here is astonishing

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:06.760
thing!
 

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.679
[this is the man born blind who
now sees]

00:40:08.679 --> 00:40:11.130
You do not know where he comes
from [comes from,

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:15.788
comes from, comes from],
and yet he opened my eyes [I

00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:17.670
see, I see, I see].
 

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.746
We know that God does not
listen to sinners,

00:40:19.746 --> 00:40:22.840
but he does listen to one who
worships him and obeys his will.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.807
Never since the world began has
it been heard that anyone opened

00:40:25.807 --> 00:40:27.409
the eyes of a person born blind.
 

00:40:27.409 --> 00:40:35.010
If this man were not from God
he could do nothing."

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.510
They answered him,
"You were born entirely in

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:37.889
sins, and are you trying to
teach us?"

00:40:37.889 --> 00:40:40.099
And they drove him out.
 

00:40:40.099 --> 00:40:42.375
[They kicked him out of the
synagogue.]

00:40:42.375 --> 00:40:45.010
Jesus heard that they had
driven him out,

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.956
and when he found him,
he said, "Do you believe

00:40:46.956 --> 00:40:47.949
in the Son of Man?"
 

00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:49.579
He answered,
"And who is he sir?

00:40:49.579 --> 00:40:51.170
Tell me so that I might believe
in him."

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:52.985
Jesus said to him,
"You have seen him,

00:40:52.985 --> 00:40:54.889
and the one speaking with you
is he."

00:40:54.889 --> 00:40:56.340
He said, "Lord I
believe."

00:40:56.340 --> 00:40:57.630
And he worshipped him.
 

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:01.539
Jesus said [and this is how the
story ends,

00:41:01.539 --> 00:41:05.885
okay, so this must be
important], "I came into

00:41:05.885 --> 00:41:11.449
this world for judgment so that
those who do not see may see--

00:41:11.449 --> 00:41:13.739
" [Now is Jesus still
talking just about blind people?

00:41:13.739 --> 00:41:18.561
No, we can see that the whole
story was an allegory now.]

00:41:18.561 --> 00:41:23.210
"--and those who do see
may become blind."

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:25.516
Some of the Pharisees near him
heard this and said to him,

00:41:25.516 --> 00:41:27.380
"Surely we are not blind,
are we?"

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:30.364
Jesus said to them,
"If you were blind,

00:41:30.364 --> 00:41:32.099
you would not have sin.
 

00:41:32.099 --> 00:41:34.949
But now that you say,
'We see,' your sin

00:41:34.949 --> 00:41:36.119
remains."
 

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:39.221
Some scholars have pointed out
that what's going on with this

00:41:39.221 --> 00:41:40.998
chapter,
chapter 9 in John,

00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:44.822
is a wonderful way to see how
the writer himself has taken

00:41:44.822 --> 00:41:48.648
what may have been a simple
miracle story that he got from

00:41:48.648 --> 00:41:51.869
tradition about Jesus healing a
blind man,

00:41:51.869 --> 00:41:53.960
and he does a couple of things
with it.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:58.768
For one thing he pulls up to
the surface these themes about

00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:02.545
blindness and seeing,
and coming from God,

00:42:02.545 --> 00:42:07.097
and this all plays into the
identity of Jesus as the

00:42:07.097 --> 00:42:08.079
Messiah.
 

00:42:08.079 --> 00:42:11.949
Then he tells the story like
the blind man is sort of like

00:42:11.949 --> 00:42:15.342
someone who comes to faith in
Jesus as the Messiah,

00:42:15.342 --> 00:42:17.039
and he recognizes it.
 

00:42:17.039 --> 00:42:19.161
But sure enough,
if he really confesses that

00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:21.331
he's going to be thrown out of
the synagogue,

00:42:21.331 --> 00:42:24.389
and so he leaves the synagogue
and he joins up with Jesus.

00:42:24.389 --> 00:42:25.849
He's thrown out of the
synagogue;

00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:27.289
he becomes a disciple of Jesus.
 

00:42:27.289 --> 00:42:29.326
In other words,
allegorically speaking,

00:42:29.326 --> 00:42:31.682
he has to leave the synagogue
and, therefore,

00:42:31.682 --> 00:42:33.719
he becomes a member John's
church.

00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:37.733
There are other people who
suspect that Jesus may well be

00:42:37.733 --> 00:42:40.521
the Messiah,
they want to confess him,

00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:44.217
and they don't do so because
they're afraid about being

00:42:44.217 --> 00:42:46.750
excommunicated from the
synagogue.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:51.103
Notice how this story has
become an allegory for what's

00:42:51.103 --> 00:42:55.780
going on in the time of the
writing of the piece itself.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:00.518
The Gospel writer is telling a
story about a blind man but he's

00:43:00.518 --> 00:43:04.876
also telling a story about the
conflict that his church is

00:43:04.876 --> 00:43:08.699
having with the synagogue in the
neighborhood.

00:43:08.699 --> 00:43:14.195
And the main thing that's going
on here also is that Jesus is

00:43:14.195 --> 00:43:19.510
the one who brings about this
division that takes place.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:23.800
What's the main focus of the
division?

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.130
Christology.
 

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:28.800
Remember I talked last time
about different Christologies?

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:31.878
What Christology is,
is what do you believe about

00:43:31.878 --> 00:43:33.739
the nature of Jesus Christ?
 

00:43:33.739 --> 00:43:35.420
Is he just human?
 

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:36.510
Is he God?
 

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:38.110
Is he some of both?
 

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:40.079
Is he a prophet?
 

00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:41.070
Is he only a prophet?
 

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:42.539
Is he a moral teacher?
 

00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:43.699
Is he only a moral teacher?
 

00:43:43.699 --> 00:43:45.489
Is he the Son of God?
 

00:43:45.489 --> 00:43:47.489
Is he equal to God the Father?
 

00:43:47.489 --> 00:43:50.954
All these are options,
and the first several hundred

00:43:50.954 --> 00:43:54.965
years of Christianity is all
wrapped up in fights over which

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:58.905
of the many different options
you have for what you believe

00:43:58.905 --> 00:44:02.780
about Jesus is going to end up
being the right one.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.170
What's going to end up as
orthodoxy?

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:10.068
The Gospel of John is a
wonderful place to see this very

00:44:10.068 --> 00:44:11.940
theme starting out.
 

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:20.460
Look at 5:19,
I'm going to back up in a

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:30.550
minute and go back to some other
dialogues.

00:44:30.550 --> 00:44:33.625
Don't worry I'll finish on time
today but we will probably take

00:44:33.625 --> 00:44:36.550
up again some of the Gospel of
John next time before we talk

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.039
about the letters of John.
 

00:44:38.039 --> 00:44:43.257
5:19:
Jesus said to them,

00:44:43.257 --> 00:44:46.733
"Very truly I tell you,
the Son can do nothing on his

00:44:46.733 --> 00:44:49.539
own but only what he sees the
Father doing.

00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:53.059
For whatever the Father does
the Son does likewise.

00:44:53.059 --> 00:44:56.210
The Father loves the Son and
shows him all that he himself is

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.630
doing.
 

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.677
And he will show him greater
works than these so that you

00:44:59.677 --> 00:45:00.820
will be astonished.
 

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.539
Indeed, just as the Father
raises the dead and gives them

00:45:03.539 --> 00:45:06.309
life, so also the Son gives life
to whomever he wishes.

00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:09.067
The Father judges no one but
has given all judgment to the

00:45:09.067 --> 00:45:11.726
Son so that all may honor the
Son just as they honor the

00:45:11.726 --> 00:45:12.260
Father.
 

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.548
Anyone who does not honor the
Son does not honor the Father

00:45:15.548 --> 00:45:16.400
who sent him.
 

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.204
Very truly I tell you,
anyone who hears my word and

00:45:19.204 --> 00:45:22.456
believes him who sent me has
eternal life and does not come

00:45:22.456 --> 00:45:25.710
unto judgment but has passed
from death to life."

00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:32.590
Look at 5:18,
right before that:

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:37.460
For this reason the Jews were
seeking all the more to kill him

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.572
because he was not only breaking
the Sabbath but was also calling

00:45:42.572 --> 00:45:44.650
God his own Father....
 

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.347
Now that's so far where you've
gotten in the narrative but

00:45:47.347 --> 00:45:49.289
notice what the author adds
right that.

00:45:49.289 --> 00:45:53.748
The very next phrase,
"thereby making himself

00:45:53.748 --> 00:45:55.659
equal to God."
 

00:45:55.659 --> 00:45:59.639
Is every son always equal to a
father?

00:45:59.639 --> 00:46:04.980
Go like this--nope.
 

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:08.610
All sons are not equal to all
fathers.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:12.291
The Gospel writer is
editorializing because this is

00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:13.690
what he believes.
 

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:17.557
He believes that not only is
Jesus God's Son in some kind of

00:46:17.557 --> 00:46:21.451
derivative sense,
he believes that by saying that

00:46:21.451 --> 00:46:26.192
Jesus is God's Son,
he's actually equal to God the

00:46:26.192 --> 00:46:26.989
Father.
 

00:46:26.989 --> 00:46:29.726
Look at 8:58,
I'm going to come back and talk

00:46:29.726 --> 00:46:31.469
about chapter 8 next time.
 

00:46:37.219 --> 00:46:41.748
Chapter 8 is one of these
classic scenes in the Gospel of

00:46:41.748 --> 00:46:46.762
John which start out with Jesus
just talking to someone in what

00:46:46.762 --> 00:46:51.210
seems to be a cordial and
relatively peaceful mood.

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.851
Then as the conversation goes
on, things get more and more

00:46:54.851 --> 00:46:57.556
heated,
and people accuse Jesus of

00:46:57.556 --> 00:47:01.539
things but Jesus is just as bad,
he accuses people of stuff all

00:47:01.539 --> 00:47:03.721
the time,
ridiculous stuff sometimes,

00:47:03.721 --> 00:47:05.750
like they're children of Satan.
 

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.429
And the whole thing ends up
with this big division and

00:47:08.429 --> 00:47:11.110
everybody's starting to throw
things at each other.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:14.012
Then the next chapter will
start and you'll see them

00:47:14.012 --> 00:47:16.461
talking again,
and again, it comes down to a

00:47:16.461 --> 00:47:17.429
big division.
 

00:47:17.429 --> 00:47:20.804
This is the end of Chapter 8
which is one of these scenes of

00:47:20.804 --> 00:47:23.838
a discussion turning into fight,
turning into a brawl,

00:47:23.838 --> 00:47:25.440
turning into a division.
 

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:27.039
Where does it end?
 

00:47:27.039 --> 00:47:32.605
Verse 58, chapter 8:
Jesus said to them,

00:47:32.605 --> 00:47:39.159
"Very truly I tell you,
before Abraham was I am."

00:47:39.159 --> 00:47:42.550
So they picked up stones to
throw at him.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:47.777
Isn't that interesting,
all he has to say is,

00:47:47.777 --> 00:47:48.610
I am.
 

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.590
Why is that so much of a
problem?

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.757
Where does "I am"
come from?

00:47:53.757 --> 00:47:54.110
Yes.
 

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:58.389
Student: 
&gt;

00:47:58.389 --> 00:48:00.219
Prof: That's the
declaration of what God is,

00:48:00.219 --> 00:48:01.987
when God says,
"I am,"

00:48:01.987 --> 00:48:03.869
to whom and where in the Bible.
 

00:48:03.869 --> 00:48:04.920
Student:  Moses.
 

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:07.121
Prof: Moses in front of
the burning bush,

00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:07.590
exactly.
 

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.646
The very name of God,
which those of us who are

00:48:10.646 --> 00:48:13.239
non-Jewish we usually say is
Yahweh,

00:48:13.239 --> 00:48:15.989
there are only four letters in
Hebrew,

00:48:15.989 --> 00:48:19.394
and those four letters don't
have vowels attached to them so

00:48:19.394 --> 00:48:22.050
we're not really sure how to
pronounce them.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:24.789
In your English Bible they're
usually translated by

00:48:24.789 --> 00:48:26.599
"Lord"
in small caps.

00:48:26.599 --> 00:48:28.233
Whenever you see
"Lord"

00:48:28.233 --> 00:48:31.297
in small caps in your English
translation of the Hebrew Bible

00:48:31.297 --> 00:48:33.340
that means that the
tetragrammaton,

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.880
the four letters of God's name
are in the Hebrew.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.539
But according to pious Jewish
usage,

00:48:39.539 --> 00:48:41.936
you never pronounce those,
so you would say something like

00:48:41.936 --> 00:48:43.619
"the Lord"
as a substitute,

00:48:43.619 --> 00:48:45.900
and that's the way in the Greek
Bible it does,

00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:48.429
since the Greek Bible didn't
know what the name was,

00:48:48.429 --> 00:48:50.494
it just would say adonai
or "the Lord"

00:48:50.494 --> 00:48:51.449
or something like that.
 

00:48:51.449 --> 00:48:53.650
And so we would use that in the
English translation.

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:57.958
The scholars think that perhaps
the best translation for those

00:48:57.958 --> 00:49:01.811
four letters,
as they occur in Exodus,

00:49:01.811 --> 00:49:05.780
is being-ness or "I
am."

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:09.538
Notice what Jesus is saying,
he's claiming to be the one who

00:49:09.538 --> 00:49:11.639
spoke to Moses out of the bush.
 

00:49:11.639 --> 00:49:14.670
That's radical.
 

00:49:14.670 --> 00:49:17.489
That's way more radical than
anything we've seen in any of

00:49:17.489 --> 00:49:18.480
the other Gospels.
 

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:23.130
Jesus could be the Son of God
and still not be God.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:26.681
Jesus could be the Son of the
Father and still not be equal to

00:49:26.681 --> 00:49:27.440
the Father.
 

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.489
Jesus could be the Messiah and
still not be divine,

00:49:31.489 --> 00:49:35.547
and Jesus could be even the
Messiah and divine and still not

00:49:35.547 --> 00:49:37.059
be "I am."
 

00:49:37.059 --> 00:49:40.090
In the Gospel of John,
nuh-uh, Jesus says "I

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:42.869
am," he's the one who spoke
to Moses.

00:49:42.869 --> 00:49:46.809
It's no wonder that the Jews
tried to stone him.

00:49:46.809 --> 00:49:49.179
We'll talk about that further
next time.

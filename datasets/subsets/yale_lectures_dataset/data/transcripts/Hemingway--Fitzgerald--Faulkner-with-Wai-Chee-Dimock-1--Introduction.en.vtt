00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:05.067
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: I'm going
to start right away.

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:09.867
And I know that Hemingway,
Fitzgerald, and Faulkner are

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:13.933
very much iconic figures of
American literature and

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.433
probably you guys are here
because you know something

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.567
about those authors already.

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:23.933
So I'm not going to be going
over a lot of material that

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:25.867
you guys know already.

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:29.167
Instead, what I'd like to do
is to come up with a little

00:00:29.167 --> 00:00:34.133
bit of material that might be
somewhat surprising to you.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:39.733
And I'm going to be talking
about three analytic scales.

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:44.000
This is kind of a critical
paradigm that we'll be using

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.467
throughout the semester with
the use of three analytic

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:51.033
scales to talk about authors.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:54.467
So first of all, there's the
macro history of the United

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:58.533
States in the world, and two
texts come to mind, both

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.400
Hemingway's For Whom The
Bell Tolls and To

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.733
Have and Have Not.

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:07.033
So that's the largest
possible level.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.867
And then we'll go down a little
bit to the next level,

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:14.433
which is still large.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.433
But it has to do with narrative
experiments of

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:21.767
modernism, and the texts that
we are reading can all be

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:25.300
called modernist texts in
one way or another.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.033
So we'll be looking at The
Sound and the Fury

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:35.000
specifically for that analytic
register of experimentation.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.700
And finally, we'll be looking
at the smallest possible

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.900
scale, micro level.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.767
And it has to do with sensory
details, and all three of them

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:50.700
are wonderful on sensory
details, but today we will

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.233
just be talking about one text,
The Great Gatsby, and

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:57.800
one particular moment when the
registering of the sensory

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.833
world is very important.

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:08.200
Let me go to Hemingway and talk
a little bit about him in

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.600
many ways as a kind of gateway
or a guide to a global vision

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.300
of American literature.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.733
Hemingway was very much
a world traveler.

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:23.933
Basically, you can get a map of
the world by just looking

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:27.333
at his writings, but he
had a special love

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:29.767
of the Spanish language.

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:32.067
So For Whom The Bell Tolls--

00:02:32.067 --> 00:02:34.567
we'll be reading this in
class --is about the

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:36.467
Spanish Civil War.

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:41.967
And Hemingway was there as a war
correspondent, but we can

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:46.200
see that he actually got into
combat situations right here.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.567
So it's really interesting to
think about Hemingway as both

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:57.200
a journalist and also
a novelist.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.633
So the global dimension of
Hemingway but also the global

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:04.200
dimension of the Spanish
Civil War itself.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.667
It was a civil war, it was
between two sides fighting in

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:13.533
Spain, but it was also very much
an international war in

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:17.600
the sense that Russia was a part
of it, Germany was a part

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.433
of it, Italy was a part of it.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:26.367
So it very much was a gathering
of a lot of nations

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:32.267
converging on the soil of Spain
and fighting a war that

00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:36.433
in name was the Spanish Civil
War but actually in action, in

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:39.000
terms of its cast of players,
was very much an

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.367
international war.

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:46.400
So this is one level at which
we can understand Hemingway,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.867
is that he really was a
player in a very large

00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:52.567
scale map of the world.

00:03:52.567 --> 00:03:56.767
And because he was such a player
on a large scale map,

00:03:56.767 --> 00:03:59.733
we shouldn't be surprised that
he would be going to other

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:00.800
countries as well.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.967
And his love of the
Spanish language

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:05.400
would take him to Cuba.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.133
So we'll be reading To
Have and Have Not,

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:10.033
which is about Cuba.

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:14.767
And this is a very unforgettable
image of

00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:17.267
Hemingway and Castro.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:22.700
We might not know that they were
actually good friends, so

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.767
this is just something that
we should keep in

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:26.100
mind as we read Hemingway.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:35.300
The Spanish Civil War ended in
1939, and from 1939 to 1960,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.667
he actually lived in Cuba.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:41.067
He wrote a lot of his important
novels there.

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:44.833
The Old Man and the Sea was
written when he was living in

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.033
Cuba, so again a very important

00:04:47.033 --> 00:04:49.400
fact to bear in mind.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.000
And this is the interior of his
house in Cuba, and I'll

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.500
put all this PowerPoint on our
website so you'll be able to

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.667
see the detail.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:04.833
But this is a cigar box that was
given to Hemingway, and on

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:10.233
the cigar box is says,
"Gran amigo de Cuba,"

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:12.400
great friend of Cuba.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:19.300
So Hemingway right now is not
just an American author but

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.800
very much a Cuban
author in Cuba.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.033
So we won't actually be talking
about Castro's Cuba.

00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:31.167
To Have and Have Not actually
took place earlier, but this

00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:35.367
is just kind of a continuing
relation that Hemingway has to

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:38.367
that country.

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:43.867
We'll move on now to the next
scale of analysis, and this is

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:51.000
the narrative experiment, the
very striking narrative styles

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.467
that we see in this body of
writing and no more so than in

00:05:57.467 --> 00:05:59.267
The Sound and the Fury.

00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:01.933
I think that if we've read that
novel, we know that it's

00:06:01.933 --> 00:06:05.200
impossible just to read it once
and understand all of it.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.200
This is the kind of novel that
really compels us to go back

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.267
to read several times because
of the level of

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:14.467
experimentation in that novel.

00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:19.033
This is from the opening of The
Sound and the Fury, and

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:21.500
you guys probably know that
there are four sections to The

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.900
Sound and the Fury, and the
first section is told by

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.467
Benjy, who is clinically
retarded.

00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:33.667
So all the action is unfolding
in the mind of someone who's

00:06:33.667 --> 00:06:38.033
not really registering the
world most of us do.

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:42.567
So let's just see how Benjy
understands the world, how he

00:06:42.567 --> 00:06:44.400
takes in the world.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.200
"'Did you come to meet Caddy,'
she said rubbing my hands.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.067
'What is it?

00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:51.867
What are you trying to
tell Caddy?' Caddy

00:06:51.867 --> 00:06:53.167
smelled like trees.

00:06:53.167 --> 00:06:57.633
I like when she says
we were asleep.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:06:59.333
"What are you moaning about?

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:00.133
Luster said.

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:03.333
You can watch again when
we get to the branch.

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:03.533
Here.

00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:05.133
Here's you a jimson weed.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:08.967
He gave me the flower." It
makes no sense right?

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:10.400
Right now it doesn't
make any sense.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.600
OK, so I'm sorry, but I have
to tell you that this is

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.200
actually a conflation of
two moments in time.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.700
The first moment takes
place when Benjy was

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.533
just a young boy.

00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:28.633
The second, in italics, takes
place when Benjy is actually

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:30.767
33 years old.

00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:34.300
So we don't usually tell the
story that way, jumping across

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.267
such a vast space of time, but
that's exactly the kind of

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:42.400
narrative technique that
Faulkner uses in The Sound and

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.067
the Fury, and the numerous
advantages and challenges to

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:48.933
that kind of writing.

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:55.167
But one interesting fact that
emerges from this little

00:07:55.167 --> 00:08:01.400
moment is that a young white
girl Caddy is Benjy's sister.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:07.500
A young white girl is seen in
intimate parallel with a young

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:11.633
black boy who's Luster, the
black servant who's taking

00:08:11.633 --> 00:08:13.467
care of Benjy.

00:08:13.467 --> 00:08:16.533
So what could be the connection
between a young

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:19.900
white girl and young
black boy?

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.033
It turns out it really has
everything to do with smell.

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:28.167
Benjy loves Caddy, and she
smells like trees to him.

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:29.567
I don't think that
Benjy actually

00:08:29.567 --> 00:08:31.900
registers Caddy as a person.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.633
She's really just
a smell to him.

00:08:34.633 --> 00:08:38.500
And I think that most of us
actually register people in

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500
that way, taking one
very specific

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.533
aspect of other people.

00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:45.067
But I think that Benjy
especially does that.

00:08:45.067 --> 00:08:50.167
So it is Caddy's smell that
means everything in the world,

00:08:50.167 --> 00:08:52.067
really, to Benjy.

00:08:52.067 --> 00:08:57.500
And when Luster gives him the
jimson weed, it is not exactly

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.833
the smell of Caddy, but it's
close enough so that Luster is

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:07.533
actually the closest that Benjy
can get to in the very

00:09:07.533 --> 00:09:11.667
sad times when he is 33, when
he's really lost everything

00:09:11.667 --> 00:09:12.933
that he loves in the world.

00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:16.367
Luster and the jimson weed is
the closest that he can get

00:09:16.367 --> 00:09:17.433
back to Caddy.

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:20.900
So this is the linkage, the way
that Faulkner is telling

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.567
the story is not based on linear
chronology, it is based

00:09:25.567 --> 00:09:29.333
on the logic of association
in our minds.

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.767
And different people have
different logics of

00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:37.100
association, and Benjy's logic
of association is completely

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.833
based on the sense of smell.

00:09:38.833 --> 00:09:41.567
Based on sound as well, but
in this moment especially.

00:09:41.567 --> 00:09:47.967
So we can say that in some
sense, Hemingway has taken us

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:52.367
to a foreign country, taken
us to Spain and to Cuba.

00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:56.400
And Faulkner has also taken us
to a foreign country in the

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.800
sense that the mind of a
retarded person is a sort of

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.600
foreign country to those of
us who are not retarded.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.500
And this is a very interesting
type of foreign country to go

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.733
to and to steep ourselves in.

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:16.967
So finally, we'll move on to the
smallest possible scale,

00:10:16.967 --> 00:10:20.233
which is actually related
to what we've

00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:22.000
just seen in Faulkner.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.167
But this is an early moment in
The Great Gatsby, and it is

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.867
about Daisy, one of the most
famous characters in American

00:10:28.867 --> 00:10:30.233
literature.

00:10:30.233 --> 00:10:34.400
And this is Nick Carraway, the
narrator, talking about Daisy,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.100
his cousin.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.067
So Nick is not retarded, he is
highly intelligent, but his

00:10:41.067 --> 00:10:46.867
take on Daisy is interesting in
that it is not necessarily

00:10:46.867 --> 00:10:51.567
the take that we would have to
our cousins We think about our

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:53.433
cousins probably nothing
like this.

00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:56.767
So, "Her voice compelled
me forward

00:10:56.767 --> 00:10:59.200
breathlessly as I listened.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:04.033
Then the glow faded, each
light deserting her with

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:08.100
lingering regret like children
leaving a pleasant street at

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.967
dusk."

00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:15.267
It's highly idiosyncratic, the
idiosyncrasy of a highly

00:11:15.267 --> 00:11:19.367
intelligent person, but in
many ways as unusual as

00:11:19.367 --> 00:11:21.000
Benjy's mind.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.300
So Nick tends to conflate
different senses.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.733
He's talking about the quality
of sound of Daisy, but he's

00:11:30.733 --> 00:11:35.033
using visual images to talk
about that quality of sound.

00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:41.800
So Daisy's voice fading out is
like children leaving the

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.967
street at dusk.

00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:46.967
It's a very interesting visual
image to talk about a certain

00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:48.200
quality of sound.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.833
Why does he want to do that?

00:11:49.833 --> 00:11:52.767
Why does Fitzgerald want
to write in that way?

00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:56.700
Why is it that the visual
register is being invoked in

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.533
order to talk about the
quality of sound.

00:11:58.533 --> 00:12:00.867
That's one of the questions that
we'll be thinking about

00:12:00.867 --> 00:12:05.333
as we move on in our class.

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:11.233
So far, you've noticed that I've
associated one scale of

00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:13.800
analysis with one author.

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.667
So Hemingway is associated
with the largest possible

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:23.833
scale, Faulkner with kind of a
middle scale, and Fitzgerald

00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:27.133
with a micro level.

00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:30.967
We could do it that way, but I
don't really want you to get

00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:36.267
the impression that one author
is to be associated only with

00:12:36.267 --> 00:12:38.333
that one particular scale.

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:42.400
So in the rest of the lecture,
what I'd like to do, is to

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.800
talk about one phenomenon that
is a cross-scale phenomenon,

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.367
that is something that invites
experience on all three

00:12:51.367 --> 00:12:54.367
levels, on the largest possible
scale, on the

00:12:54.367 --> 00:12:57.733
mid-level, and small
scale as well.

00:12:57.733 --> 00:13:01.133
That all three authors talk
about to some extent.

00:13:01.133 --> 00:13:04.667
Maybe they don't talk about it
in a kind of frontal way, but

00:13:04.667 --> 00:13:06.467
they engage it in
some fashion.

00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:10.733
So it's an important
event for them.

00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:13.467
And it's not surprising that
war should be an important

00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:17.233
event to all three authors
because the body of writings

00:13:17.233 --> 00:13:20.900
that we are looking at really
all come right after World War

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.867
I. So World War I is in some
sense the unspoken horizon

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:27.767
right behind all of
these writings.

00:13:27.767 --> 00:13:32.800
And we'll be talking about
war today, talk about war

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.867
generally, as the most obvious
level, which is large-scale

00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:40.467
geopolitics.

00:13:40.467 --> 00:13:43.900
And to some extent, when you
have action happening on that

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.133
scale there is a kind of a loss
of individual agency and

00:13:48.133 --> 00:13:50.767
the narrative problem that
comes with that.

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:54.600
There's also the problem of the
deformation of language,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.067
the way that words get used as
euphemisms under conditions of

00:14:00.067 --> 00:14:04.333
war and what that does to
language in general.

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:07.467
And then we'll talk about war
as a psychic phenomenon,

00:14:07.467 --> 00:14:12.367
combat trauma, and the
psychology of homecoming.

00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:14.100
All these are familiar, all
these are just things that

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.767
happen when we go to war.

00:14:16.767 --> 00:14:23.967
But World War I is especially
important to think in terms of

00:14:23.967 --> 00:14:31.667
those lines because this is in
many ways the first war that

00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:36.200
was not only fought on this
scale that was unprecedented,

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.133
but also different
war strategies

00:14:38.133 --> 00:14:39.667
were being tried out.

00:14:39.667 --> 00:14:43.200
So one of the very important
features of World War I was

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.467
trench warfare.

00:14:44.467 --> 00:14:47.433
This is really what we see
here, people digging

00:14:47.433 --> 00:14:51.967
themselves in and staying in
those trenches for months and

00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:56.233
years, really, and to experience
war as no more than

00:14:56.233 --> 00:15:00.833
people firing at you and
then being sunk in mud.

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:06.067
Mud is the most important
sensory material that people

00:15:06.067 --> 00:15:09.267
actually remember
about the war.

00:15:09.267 --> 00:15:14.067
World War I is also important
because chemical warfare was

00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:15.767
introduced.

00:15:15.767 --> 00:15:21.400
And so in this image, we see
actually British soldiers who

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:26.433
suffer from poison gas in World
War I. Just looking at

00:15:26.433 --> 00:15:29.900
these images, we can see
that this is really

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.700
not a glorious war.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.567
It is not a heroic war.

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:37.767
Is it a war that is impossible
to romanticize when you're

00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:39.467
stuck in those conditions.

00:15:39.467 --> 00:15:41.500
There's almost no way
you can prove that

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.400
you're a brave person.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.767
Personal bravery doesn't really
come into play under

00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:48.433
those conditions of war.

00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:52.800
So it is a war that is
impossible to feel good about.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.967
No matter how brave you are, you
can't get a satisfaction

00:15:55.967 --> 00:15:59.500
that comes from that
kind of bravery.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:06.067
And so there are a number
of consequences of that

00:16:06.067 --> 00:16:10.767
impossibility of feeling heroic,
impossibility of

00:16:10.767 --> 00:16:14.667
getting any kind of emotional
satisfaction from fighting.

00:16:14.667 --> 00:16:19.500
Paul Fussell, who's a very
insightful and important

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.700
critic, wrote a book
called, The Great

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:21.967
War and Modern Memory.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.833
And this is kind of a celebrated
classic on war and

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:33.500
narration and this
is what he says.

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.900
Well, he claims, "The primal
scene is undeniably horrible,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:44.333
but its irony, its dynamics of
hopes abridged, is what haunts

00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:46.100
the memory.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.533
I'm saying that there seems to
be one dominating form of

00:16:50.533 --> 00:16:56.200
modern understanding that it is
essentially ironic, that it

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.833
originates in the application
of mind and memory to the

00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:04.700
events of the Great War." And
the Great War is World War I.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:10.200
So Paul Fussell claims that
the war structures human

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.167
experience, both those who were
actually fighting and

00:17:14.167 --> 00:17:16.733
civilians back at home or
people who come back to

00:17:16.733 --> 00:17:21.733
civilian life as basically an
ironic structure through which

00:17:21.733 --> 00:17:23.267
we experience the world.

00:17:23.267 --> 00:17:23.933
What does that mean?

00:17:23.933 --> 00:17:27.733
We'll be looking more to think
about what it means to

00:17:27.733 --> 00:17:31.267
experience the world through
the lens of irony.

00:17:31.267 --> 00:17:35.300
But right now, we can also get
a little bit of what Fussell

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:37.567
means just from this
one passage.

00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:41.567
It has to do with the dynamics
of hopes abridged.

00:17:41.567 --> 00:17:45.133
What does it mean to live
without any kind of hope for

00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:47.533
yourself or for the
outcomes of war?

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:51.033
And sometimes hope is not even
linked to victory, which is a

00:17:51.033 --> 00:17:52.367
really radical claim.

00:17:52.367 --> 00:17:55.967
That it doesn't really matter if
you're on the winning side.

00:17:55.967 --> 00:17:58.967
That doesn't really give you
grounds for hope. why would

00:17:58.967 --> 00:18:00.300
that be the case?

00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:07.100
And then the other claim that
Fussell is making is that

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.667
irony is basically a mental
structure, the structures of

00:18:11.667 --> 00:18:13.067
memory as well.

00:18:13.067 --> 00:18:16.267
It's not just our immediate
reaction to war when you're

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:18.700
going through it, that you can
make ironic comments about

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.233
things that are happening.

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:23.233
But when you think about it,
when you bring it back to your

00:18:23.233 --> 00:18:27.533
mind afterwards, the irony is
the structure by which you

00:18:27.533 --> 00:18:31.000
recall something and live
that event over again.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.633
What does it mean to have an
ironic recall in relation to

00:18:34.633 --> 00:18:36.600
your own experience?

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.667
So let's look at Paul Fussell's
claim through three

00:18:41.667 --> 00:18:46.267
authors who have written
very memorable

00:18:46.267 --> 00:18:48.233
things about those phenomena.

00:18:48.233 --> 00:18:50.667
And I'm very glad to be able
to talk a little bit about

00:18:50.667 --> 00:18:54.267
Farewell to Arms. We're not
reading Farewell to Arms in

00:18:54.267 --> 00:18:55.267
this class.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:57.233
Some of you might have
read it on your own.

00:18:57.233 --> 00:19:02.400
But this is a celebrated moment
in Farewell to Arms

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.033
talking about the effect of
war on language and how it

00:19:07.033 --> 00:19:12.133
makes it impossible for us
to use certain words.

00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:14.933
This is the protagonist Frederic
Henry, "I was always

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:18.933
embarrassed by the words
sacred, glorious, and

00:19:18.933 --> 00:19:22.700
sacrifice, and the expression
in vain.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.933
We had heard them sometimes
standing in the rain almost

00:19:25.933 --> 00:19:29.367
all out of earshot so that only
the shouted words came

00:19:29.367 --> 00:19:32.600
through and had read them
on proclamations

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.367
now for a long time.

00:19:34.367 --> 00:19:37.500
And I have seen nothing sacred,
and the things that

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:42.267
were glorious had no glory, and
the sacrifices were like

00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:47.733
stockyards in Chicago if nothing
was done with the meat

00:19:47.733 --> 00:19:49.767
except to bury it.

00:19:49.767 --> 00:19:55.000
Abstract words such as glory,
honor, courage, or hallow were

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.200
obscene beside the concrete
names of villagers, the number

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.567
of regiments and the taste. "

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:06.267
This is Hemingway writing in
Farewell to Arms, but in some

00:20:06.267 --> 00:20:08.967
sense this really describes the
whole Hemingway that we

00:20:08.967 --> 00:20:14.800
know, the importance of days,
the importance of places, the

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.200
importance of numbers.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:21.600
This is a lifelong habit for
Hemingway, and here we in some

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:26.833
sense see the origins of that
way of writing, very clean,

00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:33.700
very economical, very not
thrilling kind of writing is

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.567
in some sense a response to
the circumstances of war.

00:20:37.567 --> 00:20:41.600
It's almost as if war makes it
impossible to do a romantic

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.800
kind of writing.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.333
And Hemingway's writing is kind
of the counterpoint to a

00:20:47.333 --> 00:20:51.733
flowery, to a heroic, to a
romantic kind of writing.

00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:55.167
So on the level of use of words,
certain words just

00:20:55.167 --> 00:20:56.900
become impossible to use.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.733
But I think that irony also
extends to a larger scale,

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:05.733
which has to do really with
the way we tell a story,

00:21:05.733 --> 00:21:08.000
whether or not we can
tell a story in a

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.067
straightforward fashion.

00:21:10.067 --> 00:21:13.667
And Paul Fussell also suggests
and I'd like to test this with

00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:18.100
Hemingway, is whether or not
after World War I, it is still

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.267
possible to tell a story
in a completely linear,

00:21:23.267 --> 00:21:25.533
straightforward fashion.

00:21:25.533 --> 00:21:30.667
Is there something about war
that makes it almost necessary

00:21:30.667 --> 00:21:36.333
in order to tell a story from
the side, tell it in a

00:21:36.333 --> 00:21:39.767
truncated version, tell it in
a jumbled version as we've

00:21:39.767 --> 00:21:44.600
seen in Benjy, or tell it in
some way that is mixed up?

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.533
All those things that we
recognize in all three

00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:49.833
authors, maybe it has
to do with war.

00:21:49.833 --> 00:21:54.733
So right now, I just outlined
some things to look for as we

00:21:54.733 --> 00:21:55.433
are reading these authors.

00:21:55.433 --> 00:22:01.133
One is the twisted logic of
events and that things are

00:22:01.133 --> 00:22:05.167
just not working out, not
landing where we would expect

00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:06.333
them to land.

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:10.333
The possibility of symmetry of
blame, which seems a logical

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:13.567
consequence when we
have no heroes.

00:22:13.567 --> 00:22:18.867
And I will focus retelling of
the past, not looking at the

00:22:18.867 --> 00:22:23.033
events frontally, but looking
at it in a blurry fashion.

00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:25.433
And that there could be some
point in being blurry.

00:22:25.433 --> 00:22:29.000
Usually being blurry is not a
narrative advantage, but it

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.700
could be that under some
circumstances, blurriness is

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.200
actually a cultivated
effect and is

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.733
designed to do something.

00:22:37.733 --> 00:22:41.467
So there's work that is being
done by being blurry.

00:22:41.467 --> 00:22:43.467
Understated emotions we
know something about.

00:22:43.467 --> 00:22:50.100
Hemingway was famous for that,
just giving us the minimal

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.900
expression, understated
emotions.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.367
And then the possibility of
counterintuitive outcome.

00:22:55.367 --> 00:22:57.467
So this just a kind of schematic
way of laying out

00:22:57.467 --> 00:23:01.200
some of the things that we're
looking for that we'll test

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.533
once again by looking at
specific passages.

00:23:05.533 --> 00:23:09.700
So I just said that Hemingway,
Fitzgerald, and Faulkner all

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.700
engage World War I in some
fashion, but I should qualify

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.867
that by saying that
the engagement is

00:23:14.867 --> 00:23:16.767
sometimes quite oblique.

00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:20.567
So Hemingway actually fought
in World War I. He was an

00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:26.500
ambulance driver, and so he
was actually in the war.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.033
But he got wounded
very quickly.

00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:30.267
He got wounded after
a few months.

00:23:30.267 --> 00:23:32.533
He was out of commission for
the rest of the war.

00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:34.767
So he didn't actually
experience World War

00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:38.033
I in any deep way.

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:41.133
And even though he talks about
World War I in A Farewell to

00:23:41.133 --> 00:23:45.367
Arms, really his deepest
experience with war is

00:23:45.367 --> 00:23:47.667
actually a war that came a
little later, which is the

00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:51.633
Greco-Turkish War, a
horrendous event.

00:23:51.633 --> 00:23:56.300
I think it's safe to say that
there really are no good guys

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.733
in that war.

00:23:57.733 --> 00:24:01.867
Both the Turks and the Greeks
were equally reprehensible.

00:24:01.867 --> 00:24:07.500
This is an image of the burning
of Smyrna in 1922, and

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.533
the first story that we'll be
reading in In Our Time is "On

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:15.167
The Quai of Smyrna." So this
is the background to that

00:24:15.167 --> 00:24:17.133
Hemingway story.

00:24:17.133 --> 00:24:22.767
And I'll be reading you two
passages by Hemingway to think

00:24:22.767 --> 00:24:26.400
about what irony means
for Hemingway.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.133
First this is the image of the
leader on the Turkish side,

00:24:30.133 --> 00:24:34.667
and Ataturk is actually the
founder of Turkey, of

00:24:34.667 --> 00:24:35.933
present-day Turkey.

00:24:35.933 --> 00:24:38.733
So a very important historical
figure that also actually

00:24:38.733 --> 00:24:42.633
figures in Hemingway's
account of that war.

00:24:42.633 --> 00:24:51.300
So this passage is Hemingway
once again going to cover the

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.633
Greco-Turkish War as a
war correspondent.

00:24:53.633 --> 00:24:58.767
He was writing for The Toronto
Star, and this is the news

00:24:58.767 --> 00:25:02.867
article that he sent to
the Toronto Star.

00:25:02.867 --> 00:25:04.100
"It is oil that Kemal"--

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:10.500
Ataturk --"and company want
Mesopotamia for, and it is oil

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.967
that Great Britain wants to keep
Mesopotamia for, so the

00:25:14.967 --> 00:25:19.300
East that is disappointed in
Kemal the Saladin because he

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:24.967
shows no indication to plunge
into a fanatical holy war, may

00:25:24.967 --> 00:25:29.867
yet get the war from Kemal
the businessman."

00:25:29.867 --> 00:25:33.933
So this actually has kind
of a current resonance.

00:25:33.933 --> 00:25:40.267
It's about oil in the Middle
East. And what's frustrating

00:25:40.267 --> 00:25:47.800
about Ataturk to the religious
side, Islamic side, is that he

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.433
turns out not to be
a fanatic at all.

00:25:50.433 --> 00:25:54.767
He's totally cool and completely
deliberate and

00:25:54.767 --> 00:25:55.900
deliberative in his moves.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:59.067
He was not going to plunge
into any unwise war.

00:25:59.067 --> 00:26:02.833
So you're not going to get
someone fighting a fanatical

00:26:02.833 --> 00:26:03.733
religious war.

00:26:03.733 --> 00:26:06.600
War is not going to happen
because of religious

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:08.233
fanaticism.

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.533
Instead, war is going to happen
because of a very

00:26:11.533 --> 00:26:12.967
familiar kind of economic
rationality.

00:26:16.567 --> 00:26:19.967
That is really the irony
that Hemingway as a war

00:26:19.967 --> 00:26:23.233
correspondent is pointing
to is that some

00:26:23.233 --> 00:26:25.533
wars are highly rational.

00:26:25.533 --> 00:26:28.000
We can't really say it
is an irrational war.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.067
We can't really say that the
war is bad because it's

00:26:31.067 --> 00:26:33.400
irrational because some wars
are highly rational.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.067
And this is supremely
ironical.

00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:38.667
Hemingway is not pro-war.

00:26:38.667 --> 00:26:41.933
All he is saying is that this
is a war that is driven by

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.333
economic rationality.

00:26:44.333 --> 00:26:47.467
So this is one side of
irony is that things

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:48.667
are not lining up.

00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:51.867
The good guys don't look like
good guys, and the bad guys

00:26:51.867 --> 00:26:54.733
are bad guys not because they
look like the bad guy that we

00:26:54.733 --> 00:26:57.800
would expect bad guys
to look like.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.633
So it happens on the largest
possible scale.

00:27:01.633 --> 00:27:04.033
It's really the global
geopolitics of war that's

00:27:04.033 --> 00:27:10.000
creating this monster that is
Ataturk but who's also a model

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.467
of economic rationality.

00:27:12.467 --> 00:27:17.533
So the other bit of irony of war
is actually what we'll be

00:27:17.533 --> 00:27:20.133
reading is the first story in
In Our Time "On The Quai of

00:27:20.133 --> 00:27:24.667
Smyrna" And this is
the concluding

00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:27.800
paragraph of that story.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.500
"The Greeks were nice
chaps, too"--

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.800
the losing side --"The Greeks
were nice chaps, too.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.600
When they evacuated, they had
all the baggage animals they

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.100
couldn't take off with them,
so they just broke the four

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:45.467
legs and dumped them into
the shallow water.

00:27:45.467 --> 00:27:50.033
All those mules with the four
legs broken pushed over into

00:27:50.033 --> 00:27:51.367
shallow water.

00:27:51.367 --> 00:27:53.133
It was all a pleasant
business.

00:27:53.133 --> 00:27:58.100
My work, yes, a most
pleasant business."

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.333
So much for the brutality of the
Turks, and so much for the

00:28:02.333 --> 00:28:05.500
victimhood of the Greeks.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.500
Victimhood is something that
actually expands from those

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.533
who experience it into a
condition that they then

00:28:14.533 --> 00:28:16.700
confer on other people.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.500
There's no glory, there's no
moral advantage to being a

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:24.033
victim in a war because the
victims are just as

00:28:24.033 --> 00:28:26.367
reprehensible as the victors.

00:28:26.367 --> 00:28:29.967
So this is really, I think,
what Paul Fussell means by

00:28:29.967 --> 00:28:35.467
saying that there's really an
abridgement of hope in a war

00:28:35.467 --> 00:28:39.200
like this is that we can't
really go and fight for the

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:43.100
Greeks because they are
victims of the Turkish

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:43.933
aggressors.

00:28:43.933 --> 00:28:46.300
You can't really say that
because the Greeks are

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.433
aggressors, too, on their own
mules on their own animals of

00:28:49.433 --> 00:28:51.067
transportation.

00:28:51.067 --> 00:28:56.867
So it is a world that is in some
sense has been empty of

00:28:56.867 --> 00:29:00.667
moral meaning, empty
of moral virtue.

00:29:00.667 --> 00:29:03.900
And to the extent that that
makes it impossible to take

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.500
sides with any satisfaction.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:09.933
It is a very, very desolate
landscape, emotional as well

00:29:09.933 --> 00:29:12.233
as moral landscape.

00:29:12.233 --> 00:29:17.200
So this is really what irony
means for Hemingway is that it

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.933
is an impossible place
to inhabit.

00:29:20.933 --> 00:29:25.567
It is unbearable to talk
about it directly or

00:29:25.567 --> 00:29:26.967
straightforwardly.

00:29:26.967 --> 00:29:30.800
And the only way you can talk
about it is being ironic and

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.367
talking about it in a particular
tone of voice.

00:29:33.367 --> 00:29:37.467
So a very important component of
irony is the tone of voice,

00:29:37.467 --> 00:29:40.500
and in that sense, our senses
are important to use.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.633
Use our ears to listen to
Hemingway as we read his words

00:29:43.633 --> 00:29:45.767
on the page.

00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:49.967
So let's move on now
to Fitzgerald

00:29:49.967 --> 00:29:51.467
and The Great Gatsby.

00:29:51.467 --> 00:29:57.600
Fitzgerald actually did not
have a very extensive

00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:59.833
experience of World
War I either.

00:29:59.833 --> 00:30:05.033
He actually enlisted, but he
didn't actually get to fight

00:30:05.033 --> 00:30:08.733
in World War I. So this is a
really interesting reaction of

00:30:08.733 --> 00:30:12.733
someone who wants to talk about
a war as in some sense

00:30:12.733 --> 00:30:15.933
the central event of his
generation but who didn't

00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:18.767
actually have a personal
acquaintance with

00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:20.167
that central event.

00:30:20.167 --> 00:30:21.433
So this is from The
Great Gatsby.

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.200
At this point, we haven't been
introduced to Gatsby, right,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.367
because you guys know that Nick
Carraway is the one who's

00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:33.900
been telling the story for a
good part of the time as The

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.267
Great Gatsby begins.

00:30:35.267 --> 00:30:38.100
And he's just meeting this
fellow that he's making

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.367
conversation with.

00:30:40.367 --> 00:30:43.667
"'Your face is familiar,
' he said politely.

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:46.733
'Weren't you in the First
Division in the war?' 'Why

00:30:46.733 --> 00:30:52.300
yes, I was in the 28th
Infantry.' 'I was in the 16th

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:58.000
until June 1918.' 'I knew I've
seen you somewhere before.' We

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.400
talked for a moment about some
wet, gray little villages in

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.567
France.'"

00:31:02.567 --> 00:31:03.433
OK.

00:31:03.433 --> 00:31:06.433
I can tell you we can go to the
Gatsby and see that this

00:31:06.433 --> 00:31:09.900
is taken from The Great Gatsby
but they could've been written

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.000
by Hemingway, right?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.967
Exactly all those points that he
makes in A Farewell to Arms

00:31:14.967 --> 00:31:21.200
about the importance of the
number of your division,

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.367
dates, places.

00:31:24.367 --> 00:31:28.767
Fitzgerald writes exactly as
Hemingway says people would

00:31:28.767 --> 00:31:31.233
write under conditions of war.

00:31:31.233 --> 00:31:34.233
Because those are the only
details, completely

00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:38.533
unemotional, factual,
plain numbers, plain

00:31:38.533 --> 00:31:40.033
geographical facts.

00:31:40.033 --> 00:31:43.733
Those are the only things you
can bear to name because to

00:31:43.733 --> 00:31:47.733
name anything else is in some
sense an insult to your own

00:31:47.733 --> 00:31:51.967
experience and an insult to
the English language.

00:31:51.967 --> 00:31:56.733
So I don't think that most of
us actually think about The

00:31:56.733 --> 00:32:00.533
Great Gatsby as a war novel,
and it is not.

00:32:00.533 --> 00:32:04.933
So don't think that I'm trying
to create a reading of The

00:32:04.933 --> 00:32:07.933
Great Gatsby based on the
importance of World War I. No.

00:32:07.933 --> 00:32:12.333
It's not a war novel, but it
is significant that this

00:32:12.333 --> 00:32:16.200
person that Nick is talking to
is Gatsby, of course, and that

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.433
they do have World War I in
common, that they both

00:32:20.433 --> 00:32:25.700
actually were combat soldiers
in World War I. And that's

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.533
part of the bond between Nick
and Gatsby, what it means for

00:32:29.533 --> 00:32:32.967
that to be the beginning of the
relationship between the

00:32:32.967 --> 00:32:34.733
two of them.

00:32:34.733 --> 00:32:38.033
In that sense, The Great Gatsby
is shadowed by World

00:32:38.033 --> 00:32:42.367
War I, and we can think of
various ways in which war or

00:32:42.367 --> 00:32:45.867
the phenomenon of war functions
as a shadow, an

00:32:45.867 --> 00:32:49.300
unspoken, barely alluded
to but nonetheless not

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:54.400
inconsequential, not trivial
event that we should bear in

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.800
mind as we read on about
Gatsby and about Nick.

00:33:02.633 --> 00:33:04.400
You shouldn't be surprised
that we'll be

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.567
moving on to Faulkner.

00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:12.367
And I should tell you something
about Faulkner which

00:33:12.367 --> 00:33:15.867
is really very unheroic.

00:33:15.867 --> 00:33:20.467
We've been talking about World
War I as a very unheroic war,

00:33:20.467 --> 00:33:26.133
but Faulkner's own conduct
is especially unheroic.

00:33:26.133 --> 00:33:31.733
Faulkner actually went to Canada
in 1918 to enlist in

00:33:31.733 --> 00:33:34.100
the Royal Air Force.

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.200
So he enlisted, never
saw action.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.333
His brother actually was
seriously wounded in World War

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:46.133
I. But for the rest of his
life, Faulkner actually

00:33:46.133 --> 00:33:52.000
claimed that he actually
fought in World War I.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.733
This is not something that he
claimed for awhile, not like

00:33:55.733 --> 00:33:58.700
1919 or 1920.

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.900
1943.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:04.833
He's still claiming to his
nephew that he was in action

00:34:04.833 --> 00:34:06.133
in World War I. This
is kind of a

00:34:06.133 --> 00:34:07.367
shocking fact about Faulkner.

00:34:07.367 --> 00:34:10.133
I don't know what to do with
that except that it's just

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:12.200
there in his biography.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:17.433
So Faulkner writes to his
nephew, Jimmy Faulkner, "I

00:34:17.433 --> 00:34:21.267
would have liked for you to have
had my dog tag, Royal Air

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:24.900
Force, but I lost it in
Europe, in Germany.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.900
I think the Gestapo has it.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.467
I'm very likely on the records
right now as a dead British

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:40.600
flying officer spy." So that's
just a fact, and we can do

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.167
what we want with that.

00:34:42.167 --> 00:34:46.067
Faulkner did write a novel
called Soldier's Home.

00:34:52.167 --> 00:34:53.433
I'll give you the reference.

00:34:53.433 --> 00:34:59.267
His first novel is actually
about a veteran coming back.

00:34:59.267 --> 00:35:04.167
So I will put that
on the website.

00:35:04.167 --> 00:35:09.867
So he actually does write about
World War I, but for the

00:35:09.867 --> 00:35:12.367
most part he's not known as
someone who writes about World

00:35:12.367 --> 00:35:19.333
War I. And instead, we can say
that there's shadows of World

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:25.033
War I in all his writings about
the American Civil War,

00:35:25.033 --> 00:35:29.300
which is obviously what is
appropriate to Faulkner to

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.500
write about.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.033
And he's not making anything up
when he's writing about the

00:35:34.033 --> 00:35:35.967
American Civil War.

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:39.700
What is interesting about
Faulkner's writing about the

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:48.633
American Civil War is that of
the three authors, Faulkner is

00:35:48.633 --> 00:35:56.567
actually the only author that
gives us a heroic, idealistic,

00:35:56.567 --> 00:35:59.967
possibly romantic
image of war.

00:35:59.967 --> 00:36:05.167
Someone who did not fight in
World War I can actually give

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:10.467
us a utopian account of war.

00:36:10.467 --> 00:36:13.433
I think that it's interesting
that Hemingway would not be

00:36:13.433 --> 00:36:16.467
capable of writing anything like
this even about a Civil

00:36:16.467 --> 00:36:21.833
War though he's idealistic about
the Civil War, as well.

00:36:21.833 --> 00:36:24.867
Faulkner is the only person
because of his complicated

00:36:24.867 --> 00:36:28.167
relation to World War I. That
for him, the Civil War is

00:36:28.167 --> 00:36:32.333
actually an affirmative moment
in a kind of twisted,

00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:33.967
counterintuitive way.

00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:37.767
So this is a novel that we won't
be reading, but it's a

00:36:37.767 --> 00:36:41.033
great novel, so I encourage you
to read this on your own

00:36:41.033 --> 00:36:44.567
if you have a chance
after this class.

00:36:44.567 --> 00:36:49.567
But it's really about a Civil
War as the background to the

00:36:49.567 --> 00:36:53.967
novel in the sense that it
doesn't really appear in it.

00:36:53.967 --> 00:36:55.867
But a good part of it--

00:36:55.867 --> 00:36:56.933
some of it--

00:36:56.933 --> 00:37:00.467
is about the women
left behind.

00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:03.267
And I'll just read you this
moment, and then we

00:37:03.267 --> 00:37:04.367
can talk about it.

00:37:04.367 --> 00:37:09.867
"Not as two white women and a
negress, not as three negroes

00:37:09.867 --> 00:37:10.200
or three

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:15.000
whites, not even as three women,
but merely as three

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.233
creatures who still possessed
the need to eat but took no

00:37:19.233 --> 00:37:23.567
pleasure in it, the need to
sleep but from no joy in

00:37:23.567 --> 00:37:27.733
weariness or regeneration."
"We grew and tended and

00:37:27.733 --> 00:37:31.967
harvested with our own hands
the food we ate, made and

00:37:31.967 --> 00:37:36.100
worked that garden just as we
cooked and ate the food which

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:39.433
came out of it: with no
distinction among the three of

00:37:39.433 --> 00:37:45.033
us of age or color." "It was as
though we were one being,

00:37:45.033 --> 00:37:49.333
interchangeable and
indiscriminate."

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:53.133
We already have seen in The
Sound and Fury that for the

00:37:53.133 --> 00:37:56.967
races to be interchangeable
and indiscriminate between

00:37:56.967 --> 00:38:01.867
Caddy and Luster is a good
thing for Faulkner.

00:38:01.867 --> 00:38:08.667
And here, the Civil War is what
enables that breakdown of

00:38:08.667 --> 00:38:11.267
racial distinction
to take place.

00:38:11.267 --> 00:38:15.033
Usually, being interchangeable
is not really a

00:38:15.033 --> 00:38:18.033
good quality for us.

00:38:18.033 --> 00:38:21.467
It's an insult to our
individuality.

00:38:21.467 --> 00:38:26.333
But here, it is under the
circumstances of deprivation,

00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:32.200
when all you can do is just to
keep your body afloat, just to

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.800
make sure that you can put
something into your belly.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:40.867
When that is the basic condition
of life and when

00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:44.700
everyone has to work towards
the fulfillment of that

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.933
condition, then race really
doesn't matter.

00:38:48.933 --> 00:38:51.433
So this is a really--

00:38:51.433 --> 00:38:55.567
for Faulkner-- really emblematic
moment when whites

00:38:55.567 --> 00:38:59.300
as well as blacks have to work
just as hard, that labor is

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.400
just a given for the mistress
as for the slaves.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:09.133
And when there's just a complete
commingling of lives

00:39:09.133 --> 00:39:12.967
in every aspect of daily life.

00:39:12.967 --> 00:39:16.533
For Faulkner, that is one of the
consequences of the Civil

00:39:16.533 --> 00:39:22.033
War is that even though there
is a battle going on and

00:39:22.033 --> 00:39:26.000
deadly consequences of the
battle that are dividing the

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.333
nation in one sense.

00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:31.267
Nothing can be more divisive
than a Civil War.

00:39:31.267 --> 00:39:36.267
Even though the nation is being
torn apart by war, there

00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:42.700
is a strange kind of healing, a
strange kind of unity that's

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:48.433
coming from that division, which
is the very local, very

00:39:48.433 --> 00:39:53.933
personal, everyday unity between
those who were left

00:39:53.933 --> 00:39:57.533
behind to tend for themselves
and the necessity

00:39:57.533 --> 00:39:58.900
of acting as one.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:02.733
So it's three people, blacks and
whites, acting as one and

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:06.700
war as the necessary conditions,
really the genetic

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.433
wrong for that kind of
configuration of three people

00:40:11.433 --> 00:40:14.467
acting as if they were of one
mind and of one body.

00:40:14.467 --> 00:40:19.267
It is a supremely utopian
vision of war.

00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:23.500
And ironically, both for good
and ill, it is Faulkner, who

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:26.533
never fought in World War I,
who is capable of imagining

00:40:26.533 --> 00:40:29.367
that Utopian possibility.

00:40:29.367 --> 00:40:33.133
So I would say that this is
a kind of irony that Paul

00:40:33.133 --> 00:40:35.167
Fussell wasn't really
thinking about.

00:40:35.167 --> 00:40:38.133
For him, irony is basically is
kind of a negative phenomenon.

00:40:38.133 --> 00:40:41.167
But I would argue that we can
actually also extend Paul

00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:47.633
Fussell's insight to say that
the irony of war is such that

00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:51.233
one of the counterintuitive
outcomes would actually

00:40:51.233 --> 00:40:55.767
include an affirmative
understanding of war.

00:40:55.767 --> 00:40:59.033
And actually, we see this all
the time, the bond among

00:40:59.033 --> 00:41:02.933
comrades, GI's bonding.

00:41:02.933 --> 00:41:06.000
That's just the phenomenon
that we know about.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.267
And what Faulkner is really
talking about in some sense is

00:41:09.267 --> 00:41:14.267
the similar bond among the
women, parallel to this kind

00:41:14.267 --> 00:41:18.467
of important emotional and
social bond under conditions

00:41:18.467 --> 00:41:20.867
of great divisiveness.

00:41:20.867 --> 00:41:24.000
All of which is to show that
there's actually no good

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.633
resting place.

00:41:25.633 --> 00:41:28.500
And this is really what I would
say about all three

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.367
authors is that I think that all
of us want to bring them

00:41:33.367 --> 00:41:36.367
to rest at some point
and they do come to

00:41:36.367 --> 00:41:38.633
rest in our own minds.

00:41:38.633 --> 00:41:41.800
But I think that it's always
possible to give yet another

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.833
twist to interpretation of what
is going on and the range

00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:49.833
of possibilities that emerge
from any one event.

00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:53.333
So this is really what's
wonderful and challenging

00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:56.433
about those authors is that
something that seems to come

00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:59.500
to an end at one level, actually
if we just look at

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:03.733
the largest possible level and
the divisiveness on the level

00:42:03.733 --> 00:42:06.833
of geopolitics, it turns
out that this actually

00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:07.400
[? unifying ?]

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.533
level on a much smaller scale.

00:42:09.533 --> 00:42:14.967
So what seems a tragedy on one
level can turn into a kind of

00:42:14.967 --> 00:42:16.367
a comedy of sorts.

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:19.300
Not straightforward comedy
either, but comedy in the

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.567
sense that allowing some
hope to emerge.

00:42:22.567 --> 00:42:26.800
So I would amend Paul Fussell's
argument about the

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.167
abridgement of hope in
some way as well.

00:42:30.167 --> 00:42:33.633
It's that yes, there is an
abridgement of hope, but

00:42:33.633 --> 00:42:38.500
there's also the possible
reconstitution of hope.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.433
And what we are seeing
in Absalom, Absalom!

00:42:41.433 --> 00:42:44.167
is in some sense the
reconstitution of hope.

00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:46.867
So I'm going to stop
right here.

00:42:46.867 --> 00:42:52.600
And once again, for those of you
who came in late, let me

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:56.400
just say that I'll be talking a
little bit about writing in

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:56.900
this class.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.767
This class fulfills the
writing requirement.

00:42:59.767 --> 00:43:04.267
And also I'll ask all of you to
sign both the sign-up sheet

00:43:04.267 --> 00:43:06.533
and also put down on the
index cards your

00:43:06.533 --> 00:43:07.800
preferences for sections.

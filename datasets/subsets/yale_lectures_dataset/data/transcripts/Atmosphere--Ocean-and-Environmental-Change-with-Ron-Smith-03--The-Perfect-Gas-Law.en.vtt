00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:07.333
RONALD SMITH: Last time, we talked about
how planets retain their

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.100
atmospheres.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.233
And I wonder if there are
any questions about that

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:16.133
discussion we had last time?

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:20.667
Just to review, we defined the
escape velocity, we defined

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.967
the molecular speed, and then
we talked about the

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:27.267
relationship between those
two in regards to how an

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:30.333
atmosphere can be retained
by a planet.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.567
Anything on that?

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.267
OK, let's get started then
with a new subject.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:41.100
I promised I would spend a few
minutes beginning today to

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.233
talk about the system of units
we're going to be using.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:46.400
So if you don't object, I'm
going to spend about 10

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.000
minutes or so on that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.967
I'm sure it's a review for most
of you, but we're going

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.500
to talk about this thing called
the SI system of units.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:01.867
We'll be using that throughout
the course primarily, although

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:05.200
there are some traditional
units that come up in

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.733
meteorology and oceanography
that don't necessarily fit

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:12.033
into this SI system.

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.467
SI is--

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:14.133
well, it's French.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:15.933
It's Systeme International.

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:18.500
We just say the International
System of Units.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.600
It might also be called
the metric system.

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.033
And you'll see why
in just a minute.

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.067
So the three basic--

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:30.367
or the foundation blocks for
the SI system of units are

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:39.667
mass, for which we use the unit
kilograms, length, for

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:45.867
which we use the unit meter, and
time, for which we use the

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:48.567
unit seconds.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.667
Now, there are some other
fundamentals that involve

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.200
electric field strength,
magnetic field strength.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.267
We're not going to
be using those.

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:58.300
So I'm going to just work with
these three and then see what

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.600
we can build up based
on this foundation.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.333
So with these as a foundation,
we've got a bunch of really

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.800
simple things we
can write down.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.700
For example, speed, the rate at
which something is moving,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.200
is going to be meters per
second, just taking the length

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.233
of meters and the
time of seconds.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:24.267
By the way, in current
scientific convention, it's

00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:29.167
more appropriate to write this
m, seconds to the minus one.

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:30.300
Sometimes I'll use this.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.200
Sometimes I'll use that.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.767
Today, this is the
more preferred.

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:39.500
In the scientific literature,
you'll normally find this

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.167
inverse operator used to
indicate that it's per second.

00:02:46.167 --> 00:02:53.600
Acceleration, of course, is
going to be meters per second

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.400
per second, so we could write
that as meters, second

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.933
to the minus two.

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:01.700
It's how fast is the
speed changing.

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:10.900
A few other easy ones, area
would be meters squared.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.067
Volume would be meters cubed.

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:20.667
And then we'll move into
the ones that are

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.933
a little bit trickier.

00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:25.233
Let's start with force.

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:33.833
Now, the SI unit of force is
the Newton, named after Sir

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.267
Isaac, of course.

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:38.933
But it's not a fundamental
unit.

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:40.567
We can derive it from these.

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.667
And the way I do that is just
to remember Newton's

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:47.200
Law, F equals ma.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.367
So the unit of force, which is
a Newton, can also be written

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:53.800
as the product of--

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.033
well, I can write it this way.

00:03:55.033 --> 00:04:01.300
It's going to be kilograms,
meters, per second squared.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.100
So that's another way
to write a Newton.

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:09.467
We could do a pressure.

00:04:09.467 --> 00:04:11.833
Pressure is going to
be the subject of

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.200
most of today's lecture.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:22.633
A pressure is a force per unit
area, a force per unit area.

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:27.867
The SI name for it is the
Pascal, named after the French

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.867
scientist who made a fundamental
breakthrough in

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:33.367
understanding pressure.

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:37.267
And of course, we can write it
in terms of the three building

00:04:37.267 --> 00:04:41.067
blocks by realizing, if that's
a force per unit area, then a

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:43.767
pascal is going to
be a kilogram,

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.900
meter per second squared.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.167
And then per area, so it's
meters to the minus two.

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:52.267
Let's simplify that.

00:04:52.267 --> 00:04:56.400
So it's kilograms, meters to
the minus one, seconds

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.967
to the minus two.

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.500
That is the pressure unit
called the Pascal.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:20.500
Energy, well, the way I think
of energy is that it's the

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.100
amount of work done as I
push something along.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.933
It's usually the product of the
force times the distance.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.800
Force pushing over
some distance is

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.333
an amount of energy.

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:38.033
Well, that makes it easy if you
can remember that, because

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:41.433
then I can take the
unit of force--

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:44.100
oh, by the way, the unit of
energy in the SI system is

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.867
going to be the Joule,
J-O-U-L-E. And of course, that

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:55.367
is going to be this times an
extra distance, so it's going

00:05:55.367 --> 00:05:59.500
to be kilograms, meters
squared, seconds

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.533
to the minus two.

00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:02.767
That will be a Joule.

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:14.767
Power, well, power is the rate
of expending energy.

00:06:14.767 --> 00:06:18.700
How fast are you using
or creating energy?

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.767
The SI system unit for power
is the familiar watt.

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:28.133
You'll find it stamped
on your light bulbs.

00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:29.267
It's a power unit.

00:06:29.267 --> 00:06:32.433
And we know immediately what
that's going to be, because we

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.433
have energy here.

00:06:34.433 --> 00:06:39.900
But this is per unit time, so
that's going to be kilograms,

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.167
meters squared, second
to the minus three.

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:47.167
I've changed that two to a three
to get it into a per

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:49.733
unit time system.

00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:51.233
Any questions on this yet?

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:58.033
Well, one we'll be using today
also is the mass density.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.433
It's how much mass of a
fluid or an object is

00:07:07.433 --> 00:07:09.033
there per unit volume.

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:11.033
It's a mass per unit volume.

00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:13.067
So this is a really
trivia one.

00:07:13.067 --> 00:07:19.100
There's no name for it, but it's
going to be kilograms per

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.033
meter cubed.

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:26.400
Or kilograms, meter to
the minus three.

00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:31.633
So that's not bad once you
get the hang of it.

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:34.800
And what you're going to be
doing in this course is to be

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.100
using various formulas,
computing quantities.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:43.233
And to improve your odds of
getting it right, I recommend

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:46.567
that you check the units on
every calculation that you do.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:49.333
If the units don't work out
right, then your numerical

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:51.667
answer's going to be
wrong as well.

00:07:51.667 --> 00:07:53.067
So let me give you an
example of that.

00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:54.633
The one we're going to be
working on today is the

00:07:54.633 --> 00:07:56.033
perfect gas law.

00:07:56.033 --> 00:07:59.900
One way to write it is
P equals rho RT.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.300
P is the pressure, rho is the
density, the mass density, R

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.633
is the gas constant, and
T is the temperature.

00:08:11.633 --> 00:08:13.667
Now, let me write out
the units for this.

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:15.900
Pressure, we already know--

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.933
where did I put pressure?

00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:18.200
There it is.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:24.667
Pressure is kilograms, meters
to the minus one, seconds to

00:08:24.667 --> 00:08:27.100
the minus two.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.500
Now, that should be equal to
the product of the units of

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.533
all these other things.

00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:34.233
The units of mass density
we've already said are

00:08:34.233 --> 00:08:40.000
kilograms per meter cubed.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.367
The units of the gas constant
I'll give you.

00:08:42.367 --> 00:08:48.400
It's joules per kilogram
per degree Kelvin.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:53.000
And the temperature will
be in Kelvins as well.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.867
So is that going
to cancel out?

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:57.867
Well, it's not completely clear
yet, because we haven't

00:08:57.867 --> 00:09:01.100
taken apart this joule yet to
see what's inside that.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.700
But it looks like we're going
to get rid of the kilograms

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.000
OK, and it looks like
the Kelvins are

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.300
going to cancel out.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.433
But what is in that joule?

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.900
Well, that joule is here.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:21.233
It is a kilogram, meter squared
per second squared.

00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:24.300
And it looks like that's going
to work, because we've got a

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.500
meters cubed downstairs.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.667
That's going to take that meters
squared and make it

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:32.533
into a meters to the minus one,
and then that's going to

00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:36.567
exactly balance with
the left-hand side.

00:09:36.567 --> 00:09:39.200
You see how that works?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.467
So this is a calculation that
should be going on in the

00:09:42.467 --> 00:09:47.933
background whenever you are
working on a numerical problem

00:09:47.933 --> 00:09:50.033
to be sure you've got
the units right.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.967
No questions on that?

00:09:57.267 --> 00:10:01.333
Well, the focus today is talking
about pressure and the

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.633
perfect gas law.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.467
How many of you have seen
the perfect gas

00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:17.933
law before in courses?

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:20.800
Most of you.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:27.967
Well, let's first imagine a box
full of gas molecules, but

00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:29.900
they're moving around.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.567
We know what the typical
molecular speed is.

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:35.100
They're colliding off each
other, but they're also

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.767
occasionally bouncing off the
wall of that chamber.

00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:43.000
And every time they do that,
they impart a little bit of

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.367
force to the wall that they
bounce off of, and that's

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:47.067
called pressure.

00:10:47.067 --> 00:10:51.567
It's the repeated bouncing of
molecules off the side of a

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:55.067
box that gives rise to this
quantity we call pressure.

00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:57.233
It's going to depend, of course,
on the number of

00:10:57.233 --> 00:11:14.833
molecules, their speed, and
their mass, in principle.

00:11:14.833 --> 00:11:18.167
At least, it might depend
on these things.

00:11:18.167 --> 00:11:22.167
Now, if you've taken a course
in chemistry, you probably

00:11:22.167 --> 00:11:25.667
have seen the perfect gas law
written this way: pressure

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:27.700
times volume equals mRT.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.767
That's probably the most
familiar way to write the

00:11:33.767 --> 00:11:37.433
perfect gas law in a
chemistry course.

00:11:37.433 --> 00:11:43.467
Here, P is the pressure, V is
the volume of the container

00:11:43.467 --> 00:11:47.900
that you have it in, m is
the number of moles--

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.767
let me write this out,
number of moles.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.367
This is the gas constant.

00:12:02.967 --> 00:12:05.133
That's the temperature,
of course, in Kelvins.

00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:14.700
That's the volume of
the container.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.967
And that's the pressure.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.467
Do you remember what
a mole is?

00:12:26.467 --> 00:12:30.533
A mole is a certain number
of molecules.

00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:31.767
Avogadro's number--

00:12:41.533 --> 00:12:55.400
which is, if I remember, it's
6.02 times 10 to the 23--

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.700
is a number of molecules
of any gas in a mole.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:04.633
So this would be the number of
moles you have in that box.

00:13:04.633 --> 00:13:08.000
The interesting thing about this
formula is that it seems

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.567
to be independent of the
mass of the molecule.

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:15.733
While I speculated that this
might depend on the mass, it

00:13:15.733 --> 00:13:20.767
turns out that it doesn't
depend on the mass.

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.800
You would think that a molecule
that has a heavier

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.533
mass would impart more force
as it bounces off the wall.

00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:29.867
But you may remember from last
time that at a given

00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:35.300
temperature, heavier molecules
move more slowly.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.800
So in fact, those two factors
cancel out in

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.333
the perfect gas law.

00:13:41.333 --> 00:13:44.567
So the pressure you get depends
only on the number of

00:13:44.567 --> 00:13:47.000
molecules that you
have, not on the

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.667
mass of those molecules.

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:52.400
That's a bit of a surprise,
so be aware of that.

00:13:55.733 --> 00:13:57.500
What gets a little bit
confusing is that in

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.967
atmospheric science, we
don't use the perfect

00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:02.733
gas law in this form.

00:14:02.733 --> 00:14:05.100
So I'm going to give you the
form in which we will be using

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:06.800
it in this class.

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:13.633
Stop me if you have questions.

00:14:25.733 --> 00:14:27.967
We're going to write the perfect
gas law as P equals

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:41.400
rho RT, where this is the
pressure again, this is the

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:48.467
mass density, that is
the gas constant

00:14:48.467 --> 00:14:50.333
for the gas in question--

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:56.333
we call it the specific gas
constant, not the universal

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:57.267
gas constant--

00:14:57.267 --> 00:15:00.733
and that again is the
temperature in degrees Kelvin.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.600
What we've done here--

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.000
I think you can see it if
you compare the two--

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.500
basically we've said that the
air density, the mass density

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:09.767
is going to be--

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:17.233
it's going to be the number of
moles per unit volume times

00:15:17.233 --> 00:15:18.467
the molecular weight.

00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:24.700
So the more molecules you have
and the heavier each molecule

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.300
is in a given volume,
that's going to

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.933
determine the mass density.

00:15:28.933 --> 00:15:34.100
So I've used this formula, if
you like, to rewrite that so

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.067
that it looks like this
form that we use

00:15:37.067 --> 00:15:38.267
in atmospheric science.

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:38.733
Question?

00:15:38.733 --> 00:15:40.133
STUDENT: I have a question.

00:15:40.133 --> 00:15:42.667
For Avogadro's number, is it
10 to the negative 3 or

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:42.967
negative 23?

00:15:42.967 --> 00:15:46.467
PROFESSOR: 10-- what
did I write there?

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:48.300
Oh, thank you.

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.600
10 to the 23.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600
10 to the plus 23.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.533
That's the number of
molecules in a--

00:15:53.533 --> 00:15:54.900
thanks very much.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:57.433
Yeah, that's your job
out there, to keep

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:58.700
me honest on this.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:05.133
So what is this specific
gas constant, then?

00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:07.867
If you follow the math through,
you can see that

00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:14.100
we've defined the specific
gas constant as being the

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.300
universal gas constant divided
by the molecular weight.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.800
So when you're using air,
that'll be one number.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.733
When you're using hydrogen,
that'll be a different

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.200
number, and so on.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.900
So what's the advantage
of this?

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.967
We seem like we've made things
more complicated, because we

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:32.433
no longer have a universal
gas constant.

00:16:32.433 --> 00:16:35.667
It's because we want to get
at this mass density.

00:16:35.667 --> 00:16:37.333
That's important in atmospheric
science.

00:16:37.333 --> 00:16:40.633
We want to know, how
dense is the air?

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:41.667
And that's why we want it.

00:16:41.667 --> 00:16:44.233
We don't want to work in terms
of number of molecules.

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:48.567
We want to work in terms
of the mass of the air.

00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:49.567
So let's do an example.

00:16:49.567 --> 00:16:54.133
First of all, for air,
then, let me put it

00:16:54.133 --> 00:16:56.900
subscript air there.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.500
The average molecular weight
for air is 29.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.867
This is 8,314.

00:17:04.867 --> 00:17:08.067
And so that turns out
to be roughly 287.

00:17:08.067 --> 00:17:10.667
And the units on that
are joules per

00:17:10.667 --> 00:17:15.000
kilogram per Kelvin.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.900
So that's the specific gas
constant for air, which is the

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:24.233
gas we have most abundantly, of
course, in our atmosphere.

00:17:24.233 --> 00:17:26.167
Let's work out a quick
example of that.

00:17:29.633 --> 00:17:30.633
Let's say--

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:32.700
and I'll try to make it somewhat
similar to this

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.467
room-- let's say the temperature
is 15 degrees

00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:44.400
Celsius and the air density,
I somehow know that's 1.2

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.500
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:50.833
What will be the pressure?

00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:54.633
Well, first of all, we have to
convert this to Kelvins, so

00:17:54.633 --> 00:18:01.033
it's going to be
15 plus 273.1.

00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:05.233
That's going to be
about 288.1.

00:18:05.233 --> 00:18:08.467
And then we're ready to plug
it into the formula that's

00:18:08.467 --> 00:18:22.700
going to be 1.2 times
287 times 288.1.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:29.300
And that comes out to
be 99,221.7 pascals.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.767
The unit on that is going
to be pascals.

00:18:33.467 --> 00:18:39.033
1.2, which is the air density,
the specific gas constant,

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:45.967
287, and the temperature
expressed in Kelvins, 288.1.

00:18:45.967 --> 00:18:47.200
Questions on that?

00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:53.300
Now, what good is this?

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:57.100
This is a very useful formula,
but it's not as useful as one

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.067
might think in every
application.

00:18:59.067 --> 00:19:04.767
First of all, for air, we
can take that as known.

00:19:04.767 --> 00:19:07.500
But in general, as you move
around the atmosphere, the

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.867
other three things
will be changing.

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:16.033
And so if I know one of these,
like temperature, well, that

00:19:16.033 --> 00:19:18.733
formula's pretty useless,
because I don't know either of

00:19:18.733 --> 00:19:20.733
the other two.

00:19:20.733 --> 00:19:26.433
So this formula is best used
when you know two of those

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:28.833
quantities and need
to get the third.

00:19:28.833 --> 00:19:31.733
For example, if you knew density
and temperature, that

00:19:31.733 --> 00:19:33.133
would give you pressure.

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:35.333
If you knew pressure and
density, you could solve that

00:19:35.333 --> 00:19:36.900
for temperature, and so on.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.600
So it's useful, but it's not
everything we would like.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.100
Question?

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.200
STUDENT: Just going back to the
pascals, do you want us to

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.500
express it in pascals or
kilograms per meter cubed?

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.567
PROFESSOR: For pressure, you
should express it in pascals.

00:19:51.567 --> 00:19:59.833
Or what is sometimes a more
frequent unit in meteorology

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:01.100
is a millibar.

00:20:03.033 --> 00:20:10.200
Millibar, which is sometimes
written as a hectopascal,

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.100
which is one one-hundredth of
a pascal [correction: one

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.167
hundred Pascals].

00:20:13.167 --> 00:20:19.933
So this would be 992.217
hectopascals.

00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:26.067
In the meteorological
literature, you'll often find

00:20:26.067 --> 00:20:29.733
hectopascals used instead
of pascals.

00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:30.833
It's easy to do the
conversion.

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:34.067
Just divide by 100 if you're
going that way, or multiply by

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:39.967
100 if you're going that way.

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:44.867
Now, there is an application, a
direct application, for the

00:20:44.867 --> 00:20:48.100
perfect gas law that I'm going
to show you now that is really

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.333
of fundamental importance for
how the atmosphere works.

00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:55.000
And so I'm going to go through
this a little carefully,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.600
because it is something we'll be
meeting over and over again

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.733
in the course.

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:06.767
And there's a very simple idea
that I'm sure you are aware

00:21:06.767 --> 00:21:11.667
of, and that is warm air rises,
and cold air sinks.

00:21:14.533 --> 00:21:17.267
I'd like to actually
prove that to you.

00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:19.500
It seems like a trivial
thing, but I'd like to

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.400
prove that to you.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.133
And to do that, I'm going to
have to define something

00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:26.300
called the buoyancy force.

00:21:34.933 --> 00:21:49.900
The buoyancy force is a pressure
force on an object

00:21:49.900 --> 00:22:00.300
immersed in a liquid or a fluid
in a gravity field.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.000
Now, this is very easy to
imagine, because if you've

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.600
ever taken a basketball or a
beach ball into a pool and

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.800
tried to push it down in the
water, you know there's a

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.900
rather large force resisting
that trying to make that ball

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.767
quickly lift back
up to the top.

00:22:26.767 --> 00:22:29.600
That's the buoyancy force.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:34.200
And for example, here's
the top of the water.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.100
There's your basketball
or your beach ball.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.400
You're trying to hold it down
there with your hand.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.233
There's something very
strong pushing it up.

00:22:43.233 --> 00:22:45.700
What's pushing that ball up?

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.400
What's the physics of that?

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:49.867
Anybody?

00:22:49.867 --> 00:22:52.867
What's pushing that ball up?

00:22:52.867 --> 00:22:53.333
Yeah.

00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:54.833
STUDENT: The displaced water?

00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:55.600
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.867
But how does it work?

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.633
In the back?

00:23:00.633 --> 00:23:02.200
STUDENT: Is it because the
ball is less dense

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.067
than the water is?

00:23:03.067 --> 00:23:05.967
PROFESSOR: The ball is less
dense than the water, but I'm

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.967
looking for a more detailed
mechanism.

00:23:07.967 --> 00:23:08.400
Yes.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:14.000
STUDENT: The same amount of
force is the weight of the

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.467
baseball bat?

00:23:14.467 --> 00:23:15.367
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:15.367 --> 00:23:17.267
But actually how does it act?

00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:18.000
What's the physics?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.033
How is acting on that ball?

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:21.667
So you're right.

00:23:21.667 --> 00:23:23.833
It depends on the
water displaced.

00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.333
That's going to be
Archimedes' Law.

00:23:25.333 --> 00:23:27.200
I'm going to put that on the
board in just a moment.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:27.633
Yes.

00:23:27.633 --> 00:23:30.433
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:30.433 --> 00:23:32.833
outside pressure pushing
down on the water?

00:23:32.833 --> 00:23:35.933
PROFESSOR: Well, it'll have
a bit to do with that, but

00:23:35.933 --> 00:23:37.600
that's not going to be
having to do with the

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.700
pressure coming down here.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.333
It's going to have to do with
variations in pressure within

00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:42.633
that liquid.

00:23:42.633 --> 00:23:44.100
Anybody else?

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:44.533
Yes.

00:23:44.533 --> 00:23:45.667
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:47.033
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:23:47.033 --> 00:23:49.967
So as you go down in this fluid,
the pressure's getting

00:23:49.967 --> 00:23:51.167
greater and greater.

00:23:51.167 --> 00:23:56.633
That means the pressure acting
up on the bottom is greater

00:23:56.633 --> 00:24:01.300
than the pressure acting
down on the top.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.900
So that's why I said it's got to
be a liquid with some mass

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.933
in a gravity field.

00:24:05.933 --> 00:24:09.033
Because only in a gravity
field will there be that

00:24:09.033 --> 00:24:11.567
increase in pressure
as you go down.

00:24:11.567 --> 00:24:13.900
So when you push that beach ball
down there, realize the

00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.600
pressure at the bottom of the
ball is greater than the

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.833
pressure at the top
of the ball.

00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:22.900
And that is what's causing
this buoyancy force.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.333
So that's step one.

00:24:24.333 --> 00:24:29.967
By the way, let's quantify that
using the comment that

00:24:29.967 --> 00:24:31.000
was made earlier.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.667
What is Archimedes' Law?

00:24:38.167 --> 00:24:47.367
Archimedes' Law said that that
buoyancy force is equal to the

00:24:47.367 --> 00:24:51.833
weight of the water displaced,
or the weight of the-- let's

00:24:51.833 --> 00:24:54.333
call it water-- the weight
of the fluid displaced.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:03.467
So in order to compute that
force, we just have to know

00:25:03.467 --> 00:25:09.067
how much water would be there if
the object were not there.

00:25:09.067 --> 00:25:12.567
In this case, it would be
the volume of the object

00:25:12.567 --> 00:25:15.933
multiplied times the density
of the fluid.

00:25:15.933 --> 00:25:20.767
But it's the weight, not the
mass, so this has to be

00:25:20.767 --> 00:25:24.967
multiplied by little g, the
acceleration of gravity.

00:25:24.967 --> 00:25:29.500
If you have something of mass
m, its weight is the product

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.600
of mass and the acceleration
of gravity.

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.033
So that's Archimedes' Law.

00:25:36.033 --> 00:25:37.300
That's the buoyancy force.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.367
Now, it's acting in the
atmosphere all the time

00:25:40.367 --> 00:25:44.433
whenever you have a little
parcel of air that's at a

00:25:44.433 --> 00:25:48.000
different temperature than
its surroundings.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.267
And that's what I want to work
out, and that's where the

00:25:50.267 --> 00:26:00.367
perfect gas law is going to be
a very nice thing to have.

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:01.900
So I've worked out an example.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:07.800
I've imagined a little
piece of air--

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.500
maybe it's about this big--

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.833
that's got a certain pressure.

00:26:11.833 --> 00:26:14.800
I'm going to use the subscript
p, because I'm calling this a

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:20.067
parcel, a little
parcel of air.

00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:24.133
It's got a density, and it's
got a temperature.

00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:27.133
And then surrounding it
is the environment.

00:26:27.133 --> 00:26:30.133
That'll be the pressure in the
environment, the density of

00:26:30.133 --> 00:26:32.333
the environment, and the
temperature of the

00:26:32.333 --> 00:26:33.867
environment.

00:26:33.867 --> 00:26:36.333
And my goal is to find out
the buoyancy force

00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.433
acting on that parcel.

00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:41.033
I want to know, if it's warm, is
it going to rise, or is it

00:26:41.033 --> 00:26:41.633
going to sink?

00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:44.733
And so on and so forth.

00:26:44.733 --> 00:26:47.367
Now, we're going to have to
make some assumptions, but

00:26:47.367 --> 00:26:50.433
they're going to be very
good assumptions.

00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:52.733
The first assumption is we're
going to assume that the

00:26:52.733 --> 00:26:56.267
pressure in the parcel is equal
to the pressure of the

00:26:56.267 --> 00:26:58.433
environment.

00:26:58.433 --> 00:27:00.467
So the pressure here is equal
to the pressure there.

00:27:00.467 --> 00:27:01.700
Why would that be?

00:27:04.133 --> 00:27:06.133
If you had air that was at
different pressure than its

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:08.467
environment, let's say at
greater pressure, it would

00:27:08.467 --> 00:27:13.333
immediately expand until
the pressure matched.

00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:17.400
If you don't believe that, blow
up a balloon so you got

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.533
the pressure in that thing a
little bit higher than the

00:27:19.533 --> 00:27:22.367
environment, and then pop it.

00:27:22.367 --> 00:27:26.133
Well, the instant you pop it,
now the rubber is gone.

00:27:26.133 --> 00:27:28.633
You've got that high-pressure
air, and what does it do?

00:27:28.633 --> 00:27:31.667
It immediately expands
in order to

00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:33.833
equalize the pressure.

00:27:33.833 --> 00:27:37.133
So this idea of equalizing
pressure happens very, very

00:27:37.133 --> 00:27:41.300
rapidly, and that's why I can
assume that these two

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:44.500
pressures are equal.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.900
Let me put in some
numbers to this.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:55.900
Let's say that these pressures
are equal to 80,000 pascals.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.533
The temperature of
the environment

00:27:57.533 --> 00:28:01.367
let's say is 275 Kelvin.

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:05.900
The temperature of the parcel
let's say is 277 Kelvin, so

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.733
just a two-degree difference
between the two.

00:28:09.733 --> 00:28:14.133
And I'm going to compute
the density for both.

00:28:14.133 --> 00:28:16.767
Rho for the environment is
going to be P for the

00:28:16.767 --> 00:28:22.133
environment over R and TE.

00:28:22.133 --> 00:28:31.167
So it'll be 80,000 divided by
287 divided by 275, and that's

00:28:31.167 --> 00:28:33.067
going to be 1.0136.

00:28:33.067 --> 00:28:38.067
The units will be kilograms
per cubic meter.

00:28:38.067 --> 00:28:41.833
That's the density of air
in the environment.

00:28:41.833 --> 00:28:45.200
The density of air in the parcel
is going to be the same

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:52.133
pressure, 80,000, the same gas
constant, 287, but the

00:28:52.133 --> 00:28:53.233
temperature's a little
bit different.

00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:55.667
It's 277.

00:28:55.667 --> 00:29:03.433
So that's going to be 1.0063
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:07.700
So what I've shown you here
is that the density of the

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:13.300
environment is a little bit
greater than the density of

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.233
the parcel itself.

00:29:14.233 --> 00:29:15.700
Now, what does that mean
in terms of buoyancy?

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.233
I think I'll move
back over here.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.667
Here's my parcel.

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:48.167
The gravity force pulling down
on that is going to be the

00:29:48.167 --> 00:29:50.767
mass of the parcel
times gravity.

00:29:50.767 --> 00:29:53.833
We already talked about that, so
it's going to be the volume

00:29:53.833 --> 00:30:01.267
times the density of the parcel,
rho sub p times g.

00:30:01.267 --> 00:30:10.900
The buoyancy force acting up
is going to be the volume--

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.300
well, we're using Archimedes'
Law now, so it's going to be

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.233
this quantity here.

00:30:16.233 --> 00:30:20.667
It's going to be the volume
again times the density of the

00:30:20.667 --> 00:30:22.133
environment--

00:30:22.133 --> 00:30:23.800
that's the fluid that's
been displaced--

00:30:26.933 --> 00:30:28.167
times g.

00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:32.400
Well, now you can see
immediately what's going to

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.700
happen here.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.867
The V's are the same for both,
g is the same for both, but

00:30:36.867 --> 00:30:39.800
the densities appear
differently.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.967
The down force is related to
the density of the parcel.

00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:46.233
The up force is related to the
density of the environment.

00:30:46.233 --> 00:30:50.867
In our case, the density of the
environment is less, so--

00:30:54.033 --> 00:30:54.967
is that right?

00:30:54.967 --> 00:30:56.133
Greater.

00:30:56.133 --> 00:31:02.067
So this one is going to
be a little bit less.

00:31:02.067 --> 00:31:03.300
That's going to be a
little bit greater.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.667
And the net buoyancy
force is up.

00:31:06.667 --> 00:31:11.867
So what I've proven here is that
a parcel of air, if it's

00:31:11.867 --> 00:31:15.967
equilibrated its pressure with
the environment, is going to

00:31:15.967 --> 00:31:17.900
be less dense.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.633
Therefore, it's going to have a
buoyancy force that's going

00:31:20.633 --> 00:31:22.533
to make it rise.

00:31:22.533 --> 00:31:27.833
Well, this is probably the basic
physics of what happens

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:31.700
in the atmosphere to generate
all the wind circulations, to

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.400
generate clouds, sea breezes.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.300
Almost everything you can think
of in the atmosphere,

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:41.467
any air motion, probably can be
tracked back to this simple

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:45.867
little idea, that temperature
differences, if the pressure

00:31:45.867 --> 00:31:48.867
is equilibrated, will generate
buoyancy forces,

00:31:48.867 --> 00:31:49.900
either up or down.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.100
Now, if I had chosen a cooler
temperature for the parcel,

00:31:54.100 --> 00:32:00.433
let's say 273, of course, then
everything would be reversed.

00:32:00.433 --> 00:32:03.700
The parcel would be denser than
air, this vector would be

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.400
larger than that one, and the
parcel of air would sink.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.400
So it works both ways.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.333
Now, this is a tricky argument,
a number of steps.

00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:16.333
So I'd be pleased to stop for
a minute or two and take

00:32:16.333 --> 00:32:18.900
questions on this.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:19.400
Yes.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.800
STUDENT: So it equalizes
pressure, but at the expense

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:23.800
of equalizing temperature?

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.700
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:25.833
So that's a very
good question.

00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:28.000
The question is, why does
it equalize pressure?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.900
Why doesn't it equalize
temperature or density?

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.967
Well, they're different
quantities.

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:35.300
Pressure is a force per unit
area, and that's the thing

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.500
that wants to equalize.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.700
There's no quick process--

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.800
temperature might equalize over
an hour or two, because

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.900
they're in contact with each
other, but not that

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.900
instantaneous equilibration
like you get

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.933
with a balloon popping.

00:32:50.933 --> 00:32:53.100
That's pressure equilibration,
and it's

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.967
fast and it's physical.

00:32:54.967 --> 00:32:57.833
And the other two either are
slower, or just there's no

00:32:57.833 --> 00:32:59.500
tendency for that at all.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:00.167
But that's right.

00:33:00.167 --> 00:33:02.567
That's the key part of the
argument, isn't it, that of

00:33:02.567 --> 00:33:05.300
these three quantities we're
talking about, the pressure

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:09.133
wants to equilibrate, but
the other two do not.

00:33:09.133 --> 00:33:12.567
And that's what leads rise to
the whole concept of buoyancy,

00:33:12.567 --> 00:33:14.967
warm air rising, cold
air sinking.

00:33:14.967 --> 00:33:18.967
It all comes from the way the
pressure equilibrates.

00:33:18.967 --> 00:33:20.500
That's key.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:21.733
Other questions on this?

00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:27.000
Anything?

00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:31.767
Well, that went through
pretty quickly.

00:33:31.767 --> 00:33:33.767
I wanted to--

00:33:33.767 --> 00:33:34.133
oh, wait.

00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:35.967
Let's do another example.

00:33:35.967 --> 00:33:39.333
I want to do another
example, because--

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:58.667
let's say that I've got my
parcel, and everything's

00:33:58.667 --> 00:33:59.900
defined as before.

00:34:02.567 --> 00:34:05.233
But now I've got--

00:34:05.233 --> 00:34:06.900
let's say-- what did I use?

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.400
I've got helium in
here, helium.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.200
And I've got air out here.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.500
The pressures are equal.

00:34:19.733 --> 00:34:21.700
In this case, I'm going
to say the temperature

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:22.933
are equal as well.

00:34:25.633 --> 00:34:27.900
But are the densities equal?

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.233
Do you think the densities
are going to be equal

00:34:30.233 --> 00:34:31.933
in these two cases?

00:34:31.933 --> 00:34:34.000
No.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.233
And let's see how that's
going to work out.

00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:43.267
The density of the environment
is going to be the pressure of

00:34:43.267 --> 00:34:53.333
the environment with the gas
constant for air, 287, and

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:55.767
then the temperature
of the environment.

00:34:55.767 --> 00:34:58.967
The density of the parcel is
going to be pressure of the

00:34:58.967 --> 00:35:00.933
parcel over--

00:35:00.933 --> 00:35:01.333
now, let's see.

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:04.433
What's going to be the gas
constant for helium?

00:35:04.433 --> 00:35:11.000
8,314 divided by the molecular
weight of helium, which you

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.033
recall is four.

00:35:13.033 --> 00:35:25.633
The gas constant for helium's
about 2,079.

00:35:25.633 --> 00:35:28.333
So look, even if the pressures
are the same and the

00:35:28.333 --> 00:35:30.467
temperatures are the same,
because they're different

00:35:30.467 --> 00:35:35.300
gases, the densities are going
to be very, very different.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.767
And so the helium balloon is
going to have a smaller mass,

00:35:39.767 --> 00:35:42.367
smaller density than the air
that it's displaced.

00:35:42.367 --> 00:35:43.267
It's going to rise.

00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:46.067
It's going to have a buoyancy
force that rises.

00:35:46.067 --> 00:35:49.200
And in this case, it comes in
through the different gas

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.633
constant, which in turn arises
because of the different

00:35:53.633 --> 00:35:56.467
molecular weights.

00:35:56.467 --> 00:35:58.933
So later on in the course, in
the lab, we'll be launching

00:35:58.933 --> 00:36:03.333
helium-filled balloons, and
you can think back at that

00:36:03.333 --> 00:36:06.233
moment and realize, ah, that's
what's going on.

00:36:06.233 --> 00:36:07.900
That's why there's
a buoyancy force.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.800
That's why that balloon wants
to rise is because it has a

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.600
different gas constant, because
it has a different

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.300
molecular weight.

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.133
It's a lighter gas.

00:36:17.133 --> 00:36:21.033
Each molecule has a smaller
mass than the

00:36:21.033 --> 00:36:22.700
air molecules do.

00:36:28.533 --> 00:36:29.800
Any questions there?

00:36:46.433 --> 00:36:47.967
I can't leave this
subject without

00:36:47.967 --> 00:36:49.567
mentioning mixtures of gases.

00:36:56.833 --> 00:37:02.033
So we imagine this same box, and
it's got some A molecules,

00:37:02.033 --> 00:37:04.667
and it's got some B molecules.

00:37:04.667 --> 00:37:06.533
And they're all bouncing
around off the

00:37:06.533 --> 00:37:08.367
walls and so on.

00:37:08.367 --> 00:37:14.133
There's a mixture of gas A and
gas B. What is the deal there?

00:37:14.133 --> 00:37:18.333
When you mix two gasses
together, what relationship do

00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:21.933
they have to each other?

00:37:21.933 --> 00:37:27.333
I can tell you pretty clearly
what's going to happen.

00:37:27.333 --> 00:37:34.567
The temperatures are going
to quickly equilibrate.

00:37:34.567 --> 00:37:37.733
Even if the masses are
different, because they're

00:37:37.733 --> 00:37:42.500
bouncing into each other
frequently, thousands of times

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.167
per second, the temperature of
the A and B molecules will

00:37:47.167 --> 00:37:51.300
quickly come to the
same value.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.267
The pressure is additive.

00:37:59.667 --> 00:38:03.067
In other words, we can define
the pressure that the A

00:38:03.067 --> 00:38:08.033
molecules are making, we can
call that PA, and the pressure

00:38:08.033 --> 00:38:11.833
that the B molecules are
making, that's PB.

00:38:11.833 --> 00:38:16.567
And the total pressure,
P Total, is just

00:38:16.567 --> 00:38:17.933
the sum of the two.

00:38:17.933 --> 00:38:23.033
So we use this term
partial pressure--

00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:26.300
partial pressure of A, partial
pressure of B-- and they add

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.167
up to give the total pressure.

00:38:29.167 --> 00:38:31.800
So for example, if the pressure
in this room--

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.000
let's call it P Total
for the moment--

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.967
is about 1,013 millibars--

00:38:37.967 --> 00:38:41.367
or that is to say 1,013
with two more

00:38:41.367 --> 00:38:44.567
decimal places pascals--

00:38:44.567 --> 00:38:48.767
part of that is due to the
nitrogen molecules.

00:38:48.767 --> 00:38:50.867
That's the partial pressure
of the nitrogen.

00:38:50.867 --> 00:38:53.267
Part of it's due to the
oxygen molecules.

00:38:53.267 --> 00:38:54.867
Part of it's due to the argon.

00:38:54.867 --> 00:38:57.567
There's also some water
vapor in this room.

00:38:57.567 --> 00:38:59.800
Water vapor is contributing
something

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.933
to that total pressure.

00:39:00.933 --> 00:39:03.933
So when you're measuring
pressure in a gas, you're

00:39:03.933 --> 00:39:08.667
measuring the sum of all the
pressures of the components

00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:11.467
within that gas.

00:39:11.467 --> 00:39:14.500
Usually, we don't need to know
that, but occasionally, that's

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.533
the way we keep track of how
much of these other gases you

00:39:18.533 --> 00:39:21.200
have. Someone might say, well,
the partial pressure of water

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.467
vapor is three millibars today
or something like that.

00:39:24.467 --> 00:39:27.833
That's the contribution water
vapor is making to the total

00:39:27.833 --> 00:39:29.667
pressure on this
particular day.

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.233
So it's a useful quantity.

00:39:35.333 --> 00:39:40.600
Let me remind you what the
atmospheric composition is for

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.467
our atmosphere.

00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:54.333
For air on Earth,
it's primarily

00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:57.233
nitrogen, oxygen, and argon.

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:08.700
I'm going to give you the number
two ways: by volume,

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.133
which is what the
chemists say--

00:40:12.933 --> 00:40:17.300
I prefer to remember that that
is by molecule, by the number

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.533
of molecules--

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.867
and I'm going to also give
it to you by mass.

00:40:31.467 --> 00:40:42.567
For nitrogen, it's 78.1% by
volume and 75.5% by mass.

00:40:42.567 --> 00:40:47.633
In other words, 78% of the
molecules in this room are

00:40:47.633 --> 00:40:54.733
nitrogen, but 75.5% of the mass
of the gas in this room

00:40:54.733 --> 00:40:57.033
is the nitrogen.

00:40:57.033 --> 00:41:02.000
Oxygen, 21.0% and 23.2%.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.733
Argon, 0.9% and 1.3%.

00:41:05.733 --> 00:41:07.900
Just remember, there's this
difference because the

00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:10.300
molecules have different
masses.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.167
Some are heavier.

00:41:11.167 --> 00:41:11.833
Some are lighter.

00:41:11.833 --> 00:41:15.067
So whether you've counted
up the molecules and are

00:41:15.067 --> 00:41:18.500
representing the fraction that
way, or whether you're

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.633
counting up the masses, you're
going to get slightly

00:41:20.633 --> 00:41:23.700
different numbers for the two.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:29.500
Now I've chosen, and the
convention is to define that

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:34.700
part as being the air, because
these proportions are constant

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.033
everywhere you go in
the atmosphere.

00:41:37.033 --> 00:41:40.000
If I go to the North Pole, the
Equator, the South Pole, if I

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.833
go high in the atmosphere,
winter or summer, these

00:41:43.833 --> 00:41:46.433
proportions are unchanging.

00:41:46.433 --> 00:41:49.300
So we call that air.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.933
But then there are other
gases as well.

00:41:51.933 --> 00:41:54.300
And sometimes they're
called trace gases.

00:41:57.867 --> 00:42:00.267
Sometimes they're just called
variable gases.

00:42:04.567 --> 00:42:06.667
They're found in varying
proportions

00:42:06.667 --> 00:42:09.033
depending where you are.

00:42:09.033 --> 00:42:10.133
Let me give you an example.

00:42:10.133 --> 00:42:12.400
Probably the most important
one is water,

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.633
water vapor, H2O.

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:20.233
And it's found anywhere from--

00:42:20.233 --> 00:42:29.900
well, from let's say one part
per 100, 10 to the minus two,

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.667
to really as small as you want
to go, maybe 10 to the minus

00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:37.900
five, by volume.

00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:48.800
CO2, another very important gas,
is more thoroughly mixed,

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.167
but not perfectly mixed.

00:42:52.167 --> 00:42:58.100
A typical value these days might
be about 395 parts per

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:04.567
million by volume, ppmv. So
we're using this method, we're

00:43:04.567 --> 00:43:06.000
counting molecules.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.267
I could write that as
395 times 10 to the

00:43:10.267 --> 00:43:13.333
minus six by volume.

00:43:19.867 --> 00:43:25.967
That varies only up and down by
about 5%, plus or minus 5%.

00:43:25.967 --> 00:43:31.200
So that's nearly well mixed,
but not quite as thoroughly

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.633
mixed as these gases within
the atmosphere--

00:43:35.633 --> 00:43:38.033
within the air.

00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:41.433
Some other molecules I mentioned
last time on the

00:43:41.433 --> 00:43:45.000
slide you should be aware
of are methane, nitrous

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.633
oxide--N2O-- and ozone.

00:43:47.633 --> 00:43:51.300
And just be aware that those and
a few other gases will pop

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:54.400
up from time to time in this
course, and we'll be wanting

00:43:54.400 --> 00:44:01.433
to know what their partial
pressure is, what their mass

00:44:01.433 --> 00:44:05.267
ratio is, what their ratio
by molecules is.

00:44:05.267 --> 00:44:08.167
We can convert back and forth
between these different

00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:15.367
measures using the formulas
that I've given you today.

00:44:15.367 --> 00:44:17.967
Any questions here?

00:44:17.967 --> 00:44:22.033
We've actually covered a lot of
I think somewhat confusing

00:44:22.033 --> 00:44:24.567
material, so I want to
be sure we take a few

00:44:24.567 --> 00:44:25.867
more minutes for questions.

00:44:25.867 --> 00:44:26.167
Yes.

00:44:26.167 --> 00:44:30.367
STUDENT: For the water vapor,
the numbers there, it's 10 to

00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:32.433
the negative 2 - there is
10 to the negative 5.

00:44:32.433 --> 00:44:33.633
PROFESSOR: Negative five.

00:44:33.633 --> 00:44:34.900
Thank you.

00:44:38.133 --> 00:44:41.533
For example, I don't have an
instrument with me to measure

00:44:41.533 --> 00:44:44.433
this-- we'll be doing it in
lab-- but yesterday and today

00:44:44.433 --> 00:44:46.633
have been rather humid days.

00:44:46.633 --> 00:44:50.000
So this means that this number
is going to be a little larger

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.033
than it would have been last
week, when we had a drier

00:44:53.033 --> 00:44:53.800
atmosphere.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.900
So that's an example of how
that number fluctuates.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:59.733
This fraction isn't changed
between last week and this

00:44:59.733 --> 00:45:01.267
week, but this one has.

00:45:01.267 --> 00:45:04.600
So these are variable ones,
and these are constant

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.200
proportions.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:05.633
Yes.

00:45:05.633 --> 00:45:09.400
STUDENT: When it's 100%
humidity, about

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.367
where is that range?

00:45:10.367 --> 00:45:12.667
PROFESSOR: Well, so that depends
on the temperature.

00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:14.267
So the relative humidity--
we'll talk about

00:45:14.267 --> 00:45:15.667
this in great detail--

00:45:15.667 --> 00:45:17.833
the relative humidity is a
measure of how much water

00:45:17.833 --> 00:45:21.533
vapor you have to the maximum
that can be held

00:45:21.533 --> 00:45:22.867
in the vapor state.

00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:25.367
And because that second
number is so strongly

00:45:25.367 --> 00:45:27.433
temperature-dependent,
I can't give you a

00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:28.467
fixed number for this.

00:45:28.467 --> 00:45:29.700
It'll depend on the
temperature.

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.667
But we'll talk about that later
on, because that's so

00:45:31.667 --> 00:45:34.367
important for how clouds
form and so on.

00:45:37.133 --> 00:45:42.067
I think I may have time to do
one other thing before we quit

00:45:42.067 --> 00:45:49.800
today, and that's to talk about
how density and pressure

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.033
change with altitude.

00:46:00.333 --> 00:46:03.533
First of all, just some
background information.

00:46:03.533 --> 00:46:08.400
The typical sea-level density,
of course it varies

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.167
from place to place.

00:46:09.167 --> 00:46:12.600
But if you want to work out a
problem and you're not given

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:16.067
enough information, you should
know, for example, in this

00:46:16.067 --> 00:46:22.700
room, the density is about 1.2
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:30.067
And a typical sea-level pressure
is about 1,013

00:46:30.067 --> 00:46:35.100
millibars or 1,013 two
more zeros pascals.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:39.967
So let's take that as just
basic climatological

00:46:39.967 --> 00:46:40.667
information.

00:46:40.667 --> 00:46:42.000
But now I'm interested
in how those

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.633
numbers change with height.

00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:52.233
Typically, if I plot pressure on
the x-axis and height using

00:46:52.233 --> 00:46:55.767
the letter z on the y-axis,
it looks like this.

00:46:55.767 --> 00:47:01.633
It decreases rapidly at first,
then less rapidly, and so on,

00:47:01.633 --> 00:47:07.633
asymptotically, but never
actually reaching zero.

00:47:07.633 --> 00:47:10.800
And if I plot air density, it
looks very much the same.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:21.433
It's such a simple relationship
that we'd like to

00:47:21.433 --> 00:47:24.033
be able to have a
formula for it.

00:47:24.033 --> 00:47:26.867
And there is a nice one,
but we have to make an

00:47:26.867 --> 00:47:28.400
approximation now.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.433
We have to assume that the
temperature is approximately

00:47:32.433 --> 00:47:39.600
constant with height, which is
not a very good approximation,

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.000
but we're looking here just
to get a rough-- maybe an

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.967
estimate at the 10% level or
the 20% level, something in

00:47:46.967 --> 00:47:47.700
that range.

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:51.333
But if this approximation is
used, then I can write down a

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:54.233
formula for the pressure as
a function of height.

00:47:54.233 --> 00:47:58.967
It's the pressure at sea level
times e to the minus z over H

00:47:58.967 --> 00:47:59.667
sub S.

00:47:59.667 --> 00:48:04.000
And the density follows exactly
the same formula.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.833
The density at sea level,
rho sub SL--

00:48:08.833 --> 00:48:12.400
I'm using Greek letter
rho for density--

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:17.400
e to the minus z over H sub S.
Now, if you're familiar with

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:19.833
this exponential function,
you would have already

00:48:19.833 --> 00:48:20.933
recognized it here.

00:48:20.933 --> 00:48:25.433
This is the behavior of the
exponential function.

00:48:25.433 --> 00:48:30.467
It drops rapidly at first and
then more slowly as you go on.

00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:35.800
This thing is called the density
for the scale height,

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.567
the scale height for
the atmosphere.

00:48:40.367 --> 00:48:45.067
It is a measure of how fast
the pressure and density

00:48:45.067 --> 00:48:47.600
decrease as you go up.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.233
And there's a very simple
formula for it.

00:48:50.233 --> 00:48:58.567
It's RT over g, the gas constant
times the temperature

00:48:58.567 --> 00:49:01.700
divided by the surface
gravity.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.767
Let's work it out for Earth.

00:49:03.767 --> 00:49:07.133
Air has a gas constant of 287.

00:49:07.133 --> 00:49:11.933
Let's take 288 for the
temperature of the air and

00:49:11.933 --> 00:49:15.667
9.81 for the acceleration
of gravity.

00:49:15.667 --> 00:49:23.600
That turns out to be
approximately 8,400 meters.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:28.600
Every time you go up 8,400,
meters, you tick off another

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:32.267
fractional decrease
in atmospheric

00:49:32.267 --> 00:49:34.900
pressure and density.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.400
We just have a minute
left, so I can do a

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.633
quick example of this.

00:49:44.133 --> 00:49:45.300
Let's say we've got an aircraft

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:48.733
flying at 37,000 feet.

00:49:48.733 --> 00:49:52.433
That's typically what an
airliner would fly at.

00:49:52.433 --> 00:49:55.833
And you'd like to know what is
the pressure and density of

00:49:55.833 --> 00:49:57.767
the air just outside
the cabin?

00:49:57.767 --> 00:50:01.267
Of course, the cabin itself is
pressurized so you can breathe

00:50:01.267 --> 00:50:05.400
and maintain consciousness,
but what is the air

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.833
temperature and pressure
just outside?

00:50:06.833 --> 00:50:10.400
Well, first of all, we have
to convert this to meters.

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:15.800
That's going to be
11,278 meters.

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:17.533
And then I'm going to put
it into this formula.

00:50:17.533 --> 00:50:22.067
So the pressure at that height
z is going to be the pressure

00:50:22.067 --> 00:50:29.600
at sea level, 101,300,
times e to the minus

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:35.500
11,278 divided by 8,400.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:38.600
I hope you know how to do that
in your scientific calculator

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.800
with the minus sign in there.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.200
Practice that.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.533
That comes out to be--

00:50:44.533 --> 00:50:45.233
let's see--

00:50:45.233 --> 00:50:49.800
26,524 pascals.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:55.900
Well, that's about a quarter of
the pressure at sea level.

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.733
And density would be something
very similar.

00:50:58.733 --> 00:51:07.533
It'll be 1.2 times e to the
minus 11,278 over 8,400.

00:51:07.533 --> 00:51:12.433
And that's going to come
out to be 0.31.

00:51:12.433 --> 00:51:16.233
Units are kilograms
per cubic meter.

00:51:16.233 --> 00:51:19.567
So that also is about
a quarter of

00:51:19.567 --> 00:51:20.800
what you started with.

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.833
So that's not much.

00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:27.100
In other words, at typical
airliner flight level, the

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.200
density and pressure that you're
flying through is only

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.267
about one quarter that you have
here at sea level, and

00:51:33.267 --> 00:51:35.900
that's why the cabin has
to be pressurized.

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:38.500
We're really out of time now,
so we'll move on to some new

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.400
material on Wednesday.

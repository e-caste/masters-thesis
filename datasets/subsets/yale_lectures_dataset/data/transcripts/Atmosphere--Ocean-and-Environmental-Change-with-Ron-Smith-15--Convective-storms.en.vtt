00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.667
RONALD SMITH: Well,
I'm talking about storms, but

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:06.300
someone asked me a question the
other day about why the

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.933
Coriolis force is opposite
in the two hemispheres.

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.233
And I can't give you a complete
explanation, but I

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:16.767
can give you a partial
explanation.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:19.933
Here's the globe, and of course,
it spins toward the

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.667
east. The sun rises in the east,
sets in the west. So

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:26.067
that's the way the
Earth spins.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:29.500
If I keep spinning it in that
direction and I face this

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.733
towards you, is that clockwise
or counterclockwise?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.600
Counterclockwise.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.600
I'm going to keep spinning
it in that direction.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.800
Is that clockwise or
counterclockwise?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.067
Clockwise.

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:52.600
So in a sense, while the globe
spins eastward, the sense of

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.033
rotation is opposite in
the two hemispheres.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.600
And that is one way to
understand why the Coriolis

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.967
force is opposite in the
two hemispheres.

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:07.333
So like I said, not a complete
explanation, but it's true,

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:12.367
and I think it helps to
understand that tricky point

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:15.167
about the Coriolis force.

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:16.433
Any questions on that?

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.633
So we're going through
storms today.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.167
This is not very quantitative
material.

00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:29.967
This stuff will be posted
after the fact, and your

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.167
textbook is very good.

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:33.800
These chapters that I've
assigned, a number of them

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.300
have to do with storm
types and so on.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.467
So you'll find a good-- of
course, I will explain things

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.600
somewhat differently, but you'll
find a good way to get

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.967
competing views of this by
listening to what I say and

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:48.867
then reading the textbook, and
between the two, you should

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:53.000
come out pretty well
on this subject.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:04.167
So we were talking about
convective storms. And that is

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:08.367
the class of storms that get
their energy from the release

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:09.833
of latent heat.

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:11.733
I mentioned this last time.

00:02:11.733 --> 00:02:13.600
That's a number that I carry
around in my head.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.167
It's rounded off a little bit,
but I use that number so often

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:18.433
that I carry it around
in my head.

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:21.667
The latent heat of condensation,
or if you like,

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.533
the latent heat of
evaporation--

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:27.400
it's the same magnitude,
independent of whether you're

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.800
condensing or evaporating
water-- is about 2 and 1/2

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.600
million joules per kilogram.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.833
And so when you condense water,
you're then providing

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:42.367
extra heat to the air, which
makes it warmer, more buoyant.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:48.033
It's likely to rise then, and
that's what's going on in all

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:50.400
of these storms. It's the basic

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.167
underlying energy source.

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:54.300
We talked about air-mass
thunderstorms last time and

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.500
how they go through
a life cycle.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.000
And after--

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.967
they take about 20 minutes to
30 minutes to develop from a

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:08.033
fair-weather cumulus into a
cumulonimbus with rain coming

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:09.400
out the bottom.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.333
And then as the rain begins,
you begin to get some

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:16.400
evaporation of falling
rainwater

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.533
just below cloud base.

00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:23.333
That produces cool air, which
then sinks and spreads out.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:27.533
It's like you open your freezer
door, and that cold

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:30.567
air from the freezer falls down
to the kitchen floor and

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:32.333
then spreads out.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:35.800
That's what's happening, and
that goes by various names.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.933
Sometimes we call it a
downburst. Sometimes it's

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:42.000
called a gust front.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.500
The front of it is called
the gust front.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.567
But anyway, the air is now
spreading out away from the

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:51.433
cloud, and that shuts off
the warm, moist inflow.

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:54.700
So it kills itself
off, basically.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.000
It has a-- after about
two hours, it's gone.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.600
Now, that outflow might well
trigger another thunderstorm.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.900
So that doesn't mean, for
example, over the state of

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.800
Connecticut on a day when there
are thunderstorms, it

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.133
doesn't mean there's just going
to be one and then none.

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:11.367
It means there'll be one, and
then as it dies, it may

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:13.567
trigger two others, and
then as they die,

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.467
they may trigger others.

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:18.700
So this may go on throughout
the afternoon, but the

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.667
individual cells have
a short lifetime.

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:25.300
That's an important
characteristic.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.167
As opposed to these severe
storms, which have the

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:37.133
additional environmental factor
of having wind shear

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:41.333
through the troposphere, usually
a jet stream aloft.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:43.733
Strong winds near the
tropopause, weak winds near

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:47.567
the surface of the Earth, that
tends to bend the storm over

00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:53.067
and change its structure into
one in which the inflow is at

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:56.267
a different location than the
outflow caused by that

00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:57.467
evaporative cooling.

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:01.333
In fact, the cold air generated
by evaporative

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:05.333
cooling spreads out and actually
forms a gust front

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.933
over which the warm
air then lifts.

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:11.500
So it actually assists in the
lifting of the warm air up

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.433
into the cloud.

00:05:12.433 --> 00:05:16.467
And this structure is more or
less stable and can persist

00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:18.500
for a number of hours
and in some cases

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.133
even for even overnight.

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:23.067
And these are the
ones that have--

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:25.433
they're larger and
they're severe in

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:27.067
every way you can imagine.

00:05:27.067 --> 00:05:29.833
I think I showed these
last time.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.967
But heavy rains and
flooding, hail,

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:34.367
lightning, tornadic winds.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:38.267
I don't think the low pressure
in the tornado is much of an

00:05:38.267 --> 00:05:41.667
issue, but the gust-front winds
coming from that cool

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:45.900
air is another source
of wind damage.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.200
In many-- in some cases, that
causes more damage than even a

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.167
tornado could.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:53.767
Usually, the tornadic winds are
stronger when there is a

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:58.667
tornado, but the gust-front
winds may cover a wider area

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.667
and in some cases will
cause more damage

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:03.567
than a possible tornado.

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:09.733
I don't know if I got
this far, but here's

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:10.567
a picture of one.

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:13.433
And earlier in the course, we
talked about the visual

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:17.167
appearance of a funnel.

00:06:17.167 --> 00:06:19.367
And this is called the
condensation funnel.

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:26.967
That is basically a cloud
composed of tiny liquid water

00:06:26.967 --> 00:06:34.000
droplets that's produced when
air from outside moves in and

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.033
drops its pressure.

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:40.067
The pressure inside a tornado
is much lower than in the

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:42.600
surrounding atmosphere, so that
air that moves in there

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.533
is going to expand, not by
moving vertically, but by

00:06:46.533 --> 00:06:48.667
moving into the tornado.

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:51.900
It'll expand, cool, and
you can form a cloud.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.833
And that's what you're seeing.

00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:55.800
In fact, you often see this
descending from cloud base.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.167
The cloud base will appear to
be flat, and then as the

00:06:59.167 --> 00:07:01.867
tornado develops, that
funnel cloud will

00:07:01.867 --> 00:07:03.400
descend to the ground.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.633
When you see that, it's more
natural to understand that

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:09.233
it's really like a cloud,
because it's actually an

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:12.833
extension of that cloud reaching
down to the surface.

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:15.200
Whereas this other thing here
is the debris funnel.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.400
That's stuff that's been kicked
up by the high winds at

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.367
the surface, and that's
not water.

00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:26.067
That's usually dirt or soil or
cows or cars or houses and

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:27.300
things like that.

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:33.000
And here again, you see the
condensation funnel, and you

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.967
see a debris funnel
around that.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.033
Lightning comes along
with that.

00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:45.667
And of course, these sparks of
electricity is what you hear

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:46.900
as thunder.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.633
And I think you know that-- how
many know how to compute

00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:53.633
in your mind how
far a storm is?

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:56.133
Do you know that trick?

00:07:56.133 --> 00:07:59.133
It's pretty simple, because you
assume that the light that

00:07:59.133 --> 00:08:04.233
comes from the lightning strike
travels to your eye at

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:07.000
the speed of light, which
is, you might say,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.667
instantaneous, right?

00:08:09.667 --> 00:08:15.600
Whereas the sound that reaches
your ear moves at the speed of

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.600
sound, which is something like
300 meters per second.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.733
And so if you simply-- when you
see a lightning flash, if

00:08:23.733 --> 00:08:27.367
you then count out the
number of seconds--

00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:29.100
one second, two seconds--

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.533
so for every second delay
between the two, that's 300

00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:34.567
meters of distance.

00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:38.767
So if it was three seconds
delayed, that would be 900

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:41.400
meters or about a kilometer
away from you.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.033
So that's an easy calculation
to do, realizing that the

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:48.900
thunder is produced by
the lightning itself.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.833
You suddenly heat that air with
the electrical discharge,

00:08:52.833 --> 00:08:57.467
it expands suddenly, produces
an acoustic signal that then

00:08:57.467 --> 00:09:03.667
travels to your ear, and you
recognize that as thunder.

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:04.900
Questions on that?

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.567
Hailstones, because there's a
lot of supercooled water above

00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:16.267
the freezing line in those
storms and very strong updraft

00:09:16.267 --> 00:09:19.533
motions that can suspend
particles while

00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:22.367
they grow by riming.

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:26.200
And eventually, when either that
updraft weakens or the

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.400
object becomes too
large, it'll then

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.567
fall out of the sky.

00:09:29.567 --> 00:09:32.667
And it's too large to melt.

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:36.033
I told you many times that a
snowflake will melt as it

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:37.900
passes down through
the freezing level

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.300
and become a raindrop.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:43.533
But if I've got a chunk of ice
that's five centimeters across

00:09:43.533 --> 00:09:45.900
and it falls down,
it's too big.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.733
It's going to take
minutes to melt.

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:51.367
And by that time, it'll
be at the surface.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:55.833
It'll be wet, it'll have a wet
outer surface, but it'll still

00:09:55.833 --> 00:09:59.767
be a solid chunk of ice when
it falls to Earth and hits.

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:08.967
This is thunderstorm frequency
across the United States,

00:10:08.967 --> 00:10:12.133
number of thunderstorms
per year.

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:13.667
Now, I've told you that
these are called--

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:16.400
most of these are just air-mass
thunderstorms.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:18.867
They're not so damaging.

00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:24.067
And it looks like Florida is
the capital for air-mass

00:10:24.067 --> 00:10:28.433
thunderstorms. You get
100 of them per year.

00:10:28.433 --> 00:10:31.800
Other areas get far less.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.267
But these aren't the
severe ones.

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:35.667
I'll show you the severe
ones in just a moment.

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:37.833
You don't get many thunderstorms
in the West

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:43.467
Coast, because there's too
strong an inversion there.

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:46.533
Theres a temp-- normally, with
the cold water off the coast

00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:49.633
from the California Current,
the atmosphere over here is

00:10:49.633 --> 00:10:54.567
just too stable, too many
inversions to get

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:57.700
thunderstorms forming in
that part of the world.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.133
So it really is kind of an
East Coast phenomenon.

00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:03.000
But it starts right at the Rocky
Mountain Front here in

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.267
Colorado, and you find storms
then pretty much all the way

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.733
to the east, including all the
way up into Canada you get

00:11:09.733 --> 00:11:12.467
quite a few.

00:11:12.467 --> 00:11:17.433
Now, I don't often in this
course talk about the research

00:11:17.433 --> 00:11:21.167
that goes on here at Yale or in
my group, but I wanted to

00:11:21.167 --> 00:11:22.933
show you one thing.

00:11:22.933 --> 00:11:26.233
I had a Ph.D. Student who
finished a couple of years ago

00:11:26.233 --> 00:11:30.400
who tried to understand the
timing of thunderstorms from

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.100
west to east across--

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.833
in a region generally
like this.

00:11:34.833 --> 00:11:38.600
And so she looked at
a lot of climate--

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.200
of rainfall data from the summer
months and came up with

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.233
a diagram like this.

00:11:45.233 --> 00:11:46.333
Now, I'm going to
explain this.

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:48.567
It's going to take a minute just
to figure out what in the

00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:49.867
heck is plotted here.

00:11:49.867 --> 00:11:52.300
But on this axis is longitude.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:57.267
So it's distance east-west
basically through a region

00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:58.200
something like this.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.233
So it's the distance east-west
in a latitude belt

00:12:01.233 --> 00:12:03.400
something like that.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.367
And on this axis is the
local solar time.

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:10.867
So instead of actually using
time zones, which are kind of

00:12:10.867 --> 00:12:12.500
an artificial construct--

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.533
they make arbitrary choices
about where to switch from

00:12:15.533 --> 00:12:18.200
Eastern Time to Central Time
to Mountain Time--

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.433
this is just local time.

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:23.000
Basically, how high is the sun
in the sky, that determines

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.567
what this clock would be.

00:12:25.567 --> 00:12:29.400
And then contoured is the
precipitation rate, the hourly

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.967
precipitation rate.

00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:34.567
So from this diagram, for any
given latitude, if you scan

00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:37.233
up, you'll find how much
it rains at different

00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:38.167
hours of the day.

00:12:38.167 --> 00:12:40.267
Now, we did repeat.

00:12:40.267 --> 00:12:41.933
We plotted everything twice.

00:12:41.933 --> 00:12:45.367
So you've got zero to 24
and then 24 to 48.

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:48.367
But if you notice, the plot
just repeats as well.

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:51.467
So we've just put the same data
on there twice, which

00:12:51.467 --> 00:12:53.633
makes it a little bit
easier to go through

00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:55.833
a full day's cycle.

00:12:55.833 --> 00:12:59.400
You can start at any hour you
want and go 24 hours ahead.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.567
So this is the Rocky
Mountain Front.

00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:06.200
This is where a lot of
thunderstorms form.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.167
It's over in here.

00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:14.500
And those storms tend to form
between 1200 and 1800.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.533
So that's in the afternoon,
local solar time.

00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:18.933
Now, that's not a
surprise, right?

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:21.500
Because one of the most
important triggers for

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.367
thunderstorms is the heating
of the Earth by the Sun.

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:30.467
So it's in the afternoon when
you've built up this deep

00:13:30.467 --> 00:13:32.867
convective boundary layer
by heating the

00:13:32.867 --> 00:13:34.067
surface of the Earth.

00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:37.367
And finally, that heating is
going to generate cumulus

00:13:37.367 --> 00:13:40.033
clouds, and they'll then grow
to form cumulonimbus.

00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:42.567
So it's not surprising
that you find

00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:43.967
storms beginning there.

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:46.933
And over the East Coast-- here
in Connecticut, for example--

00:13:46.933 --> 00:13:53.667
you also find that the storms
form in the afternoon, due to

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:55.267
the heating of the
Earth by the Sun.

00:13:55.267 --> 00:14:00.700
But look what happens in this
middle territory, which is

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.800
basically this very large
region through here.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.367
That has some other kind of a
trigger, because, look, that

00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:09.367
is advancing in time.

00:14:09.367 --> 00:14:14.000
As I move eastward, the time
of day when thunderstorms

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.933
occur is 6 o'clock, 9 o'clock
in the evening, midnight, 3

00:14:18.933 --> 00:14:21.633
o'clock in the morning,
6 o'clock the next

00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:22.567
morning, and so on.

00:14:22.567 --> 00:14:25.767
So you've got something that is
departing from the simple

00:14:25.767 --> 00:14:29.467
idea of the Sun as the
driving force.

00:14:29.467 --> 00:14:33.100
What this turns out to be is a
disturbance that's generated

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:36.600
each day over the Rocky
Mountains and then is--

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.467
whoops, wrong direction--

00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:42.933
and then is pushed eastwards
by the westerly winds.

00:14:42.933 --> 00:14:46.100
And it's a warm air disturbance

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.367
generated over the mountains.

00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:51.000
And as it drifts eastward
aloft, it triggers

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.233
thunderstorms as
it moves along.

00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:56.800
I had somebody in my office
a couple of weeks ago, a

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.433
scientist who grew up in one
of these states and always

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:05.200
wondered why there they had a
maximum thunderstorm frequency

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.067
in the middle of the night.

00:15:06.067 --> 00:15:07.100
Who would expect that?

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.700
It doesn't seem to fit with
the standard thermal solar

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:11.467
forcing idea.

00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:12.333
Well, this is why.

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:15.067
In this case, my student
discovered that it's a

00:15:15.067 --> 00:15:17.933
disturbance generated over the
Rockies that moves eastward

00:15:17.933 --> 00:15:21.867
and gives that progressive
timing to the thunderstorms.

00:15:21.867 --> 00:15:25.233
Then you get east of the
Appalachian Mountains, and you

00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:28.767
get back to a more normal
mid-afternoon

00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:30.967
thunderstorm maxima.

00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:32.667
Any questions on that?

00:15:32.667 --> 00:15:34.900
STUDENT: What are those
dotted lines?

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.800
PROFESSOR: I think
they're reference lines

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:41.100
for some other figure in the
paper that's not shown here.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.000
So there are sloping lines
that are drawn in here at

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.100
different speeds.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.800
Since this is distance versus
time, a slope represents a

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.500
propagation speed--

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.500
30 meters per second, 14 meters
per second, seven

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:55.467
meters per second.

00:15:55.467 --> 00:15:58.933
These disturbances move eastward
at about 14 meters

00:15:58.933 --> 00:16:03.100
per second, bringing those
thunderstorms progressively

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.100
later as you move

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.967
towards the east. Yes.

00:16:05.967 --> 00:16:09.467
STUDENT: Was it already known
that there was a warm weather

00:16:09.467 --> 00:16:13.133
air disturbance over
the Rockies, or did

00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:13.700
she figure that out?

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.967
PROFESSOR: No, that's not shown in this

00:16:15.967 --> 00:16:17.267
figure, but that
was actually--

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:21.267
there was some hint about this
progression already from radar

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:24.667
data, but she confirmed
it using surface data.

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:27.667
And then she discovered this
warm air pulse aloft that was

00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:29.500
doing the triggering.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.833
That was the point of
her thesis, yeah.

00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:34.400
Anything else on that?

00:16:37.733 --> 00:16:40.700
So now let's get to the severe
thunderstorms. And the way

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.567
I'll get at that is just to
show you this tornado

00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:46.667
frequency map.

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:48.100
And of course, it looks
a bit different.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.067
There is a maximum in Florida,
but it's smaller.

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:55.733
And the big maximum
is over Texas,

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:58.300
Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.800
And of course, this is
what's called Tornado

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.167
Alley by some people.

00:17:03.167 --> 00:17:04.467
You've heard that expression.

00:17:04.467 --> 00:17:05.233
It's kind of the region.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:08.033
But what's special about this
region apparently-- and by the

00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:11.433
way, this maximizes
in the spring.

00:17:11.433 --> 00:17:16.800
So typically, this is an
April-May phenomenon.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.100
If you have watched any of
these shows about chasing

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:23.767
tornadoes and if you want to
do that, then schedule your

00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:27.700
trip in April and May, because
that's when things get

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.733
exciting out there.

00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:33.467
And what's special about this
region is that you get some

00:17:33.467 --> 00:17:36.700
warm, moist air moving in from
the Gulf of Mexico at low

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.800
levels, and then you get the jet
stream coming across the

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.733
Rocky Mountains at
high levels.

00:17:42.733 --> 00:17:46.300
And that gives you the
shear that you need.

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:48.800
And you've got the moisture,
because you've got the high

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.433
temperatures and high humidities
in the low levels.

00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:54.267
So all the ingredients
are kind of there.

00:17:54.267 --> 00:17:57.067
Not every day-- it fluctuates
from day to day-- but

00:17:57.067 --> 00:18:00.400
generally, that's the reason why
this area is so special.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.733
And as far as I know, there's
no other place on Earth that

00:18:04.733 --> 00:18:08.100
has as many-- as high a tornado
frequency as this

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:08.700
region does.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.633
So this is special even
if you look globally.

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:15.400
There are a few other places in
Asia and in Australia where

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.700
they get this phenomenon, but
this is kind of the most

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:23.467
frequent place for
it to occur.

00:18:23.467 --> 00:18:25.967
Questions there?

00:18:25.967 --> 00:18:28.367
Anybody from Tornado Alley?

00:18:28.367 --> 00:18:30.767
Anybody live in these states?

00:18:30.767 --> 00:18:32.633
Not at all?

00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:35.800
You're all East Coast or
West Coast people?

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.267
Yeah.

00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:38.400
STUDENT: The little spots in the
Southeast, is there-- is

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.633
that a coincidence?

00:18:41.933 --> 00:18:43.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.433
For example, I read a paper once
about this one, who tried

00:18:47.433 --> 00:18:51.300
to claim there was something
special about the terrain in

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.133
that region.

00:18:52.133 --> 00:18:54.600
But to be honest with you, I
would doubt the statistical

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.667
significance of something like
that, unless I really had seen

00:18:57.667 --> 00:19:00.867
a very rigorous statistical
analysis.

00:19:00.867 --> 00:19:04.433
I would wonder whether these
spots are really realistic or

00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:07.067
whether they're just a fluke
of what-- and he had one or

00:19:07.067 --> 00:19:10.200
two events there, and by random
chance, that happened

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.300
to look like a little maximum
or something like that.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.800
So I wouldn't try to put too
much significance on those.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.433
Whether that-- that may be
distinct from this one.

00:19:18.433 --> 00:19:20.800
I think the case could
be made there.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.267
But I'm not sure why.

00:19:22.267 --> 00:19:27.267
I'm not sure why there would
be two maxima there.

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:31.200
We do get them in Connecticut
as well.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.967
Not frequently, but every few
years, we get a tornado that

00:19:33.967 --> 00:19:35.200
comes down through the state.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.167
It can cause quite
a bit of damage.

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:42.667
But it's like a ratio of 7:1
or 9:1 in terms of the

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:47.700
relative frequency of
those two things.

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.233
So before we leave the subject,
I want to give you a

00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:54.933
little bit of a sense for
what a tornado is like.

00:19:54.933 --> 00:19:59.333
And here's a picture from May
2007, the devastation in

00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:00.700
Greensburg, Kansas.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.333
Really a whole town was--

00:20:02.333 --> 00:20:03.333
isn't that horrible?

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:04.867
It's just everything
wiped out.

00:20:04.867 --> 00:20:07.833
And the only way I could think
of-- and this is going to take

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:11.767
a couple minutes and may be a
little bit boring-- we'll

00:20:11.767 --> 00:20:15.667
see-- but I want to show you
what the news was saying at

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:16.933
this point.

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:21.733
So this is--

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:44.467
this is the radar, the
Doppler radar--

00:20:44.467 --> 00:20:46.567
I'll explain why that's
important in just a minute--

00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:47.800
blue-red.

00:20:53.533 --> 00:20:54.000
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.867
-So keep in mind, as far
as looking through the

00:20:55.867 --> 00:20:58.500
thunderstorm and seeing the
tornado appear in Greensburg,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.767
you're not going to, because
it's going to be obscured by

00:21:00.767 --> 00:21:04.433
the very heavy rain and also the
hail between you and that

00:21:04.433 --> 00:21:05.300
circulation.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.600
Greenburg's up here at the
top of the screen.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:08.733
-And when we switch
over to the

00:21:08.733 --> 00:21:10.800
which-way-the-wind's-blowing
mode to the

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.900
how-hard-it's-raining mode,
this is what we have now.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.933
And you can see that very
high reflectivity.

00:21:14.933 --> 00:21:16.667
What you see is that red.

00:21:16.667 --> 00:21:19.033
That is the heavy
rain and hail.

00:21:19.033 --> 00:21:21.433
So you're not going to be able
to visualize the thunderstorm

00:21:21.433 --> 00:21:23.167
if it's still producing
a tornado.

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:26.033
-Now, contact with Lanny Dean,
we temporarily lost it because

00:21:26.033 --> 00:21:28.667
of the cell service in this
part of Kansas, but once

00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:30.833
again, you're seeing a very
strong, very well-pronounced

00:21:30.833 --> 00:21:33.900
hook echo in addition to the
very strong velocity returns--

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.333
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:37.067
PROFESSOR: That's
the hook echo right there.

00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:37.367
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:37.367 --> 00:21:39.233
-The city of Greensburg and to
the south, I really suggest

00:21:39.233 --> 00:21:41.267
you go down to your
storm shelters.

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:43.200
I said I'm not an alarmist kind
of guy, but if the only

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.267
thing-- this storm
is very scary--

00:21:45.267 --> 00:21:47.733
in the worst case, I'm just
going to waste a little bit of

00:21:47.733 --> 00:21:50.167
your time tonight if you go down
to your shelters and it

00:21:50.167 --> 00:21:52.200
turns out not to be producing
a tornado.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.000
But just what we're
seeing here is

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.600
a very scary signature.

00:21:58.533 --> 00:22:00.367
-Lanny, how close are you
to the county line?

00:22:00.367 --> 00:22:03.433
-We have passed the county
line already, Jay.

00:22:03.433 --> 00:22:05.633
-So you're north of the county
line, and the tornado, from

00:22:05.633 --> 00:22:08.833
your vantage point, is to the
east of US 183, correct?

00:22:08.833 --> 00:22:11.000
-Jay, a very large tornado.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.433
OK, I don't know who reported
it in the west. We have two

00:22:13.433 --> 00:22:15.200
tornadoes on the ground, Jay.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.533
We have a small-- well, excuse
me it's a medium, if you will,

00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:24.333
to my north-northeast. We have
a very large wedge tornado on

00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:25.900
the ground that's going
to be almost

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.467
due north of my location.

00:22:27.467 --> 00:22:31.167
I'm going to put it about five
miles, Jay, about five miles,

00:22:31.167 --> 00:22:34.500
I'm guessing, north, maybe five
to eight miles north of

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.933
my location right now, Jay.

00:22:35.933 --> 00:22:37.200
-All right, Landy, try
to get the first cam

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.000
fired up if you can.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.800
And now let's go
over to Darren.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.200
And, Darren, what do you see
from your vantage point?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.933
-Right now, we're just about
ready to get on the Highway

00:22:44.933 --> 00:22:48.567
183 to go north towards
Greensburg.

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:51.767
We still have a large wedge
tornado on the ground to our

00:22:51.767 --> 00:22:54.500
north with possible satellite
tornadoes.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.667
We just saw a lightning flash
that still probably--

00:22:59.667 --> 00:23:02.833
I would say probably five miles
to our north is where

00:23:02.833 --> 00:23:03.867
the tornado would be located.

00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:08.000
And it has been on the ground
for probably 25 minutes, maybe

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.733
even longer.

00:23:08.733 --> 00:23:10.233
[END VIDEO PLAYBCK]

00:23:10.233 --> 00:23:11.600
PROFESSOR: It's moving in that direction.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:12.667
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:13.000
-What cross-street?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.033
How far north of the
Kiowa-Comanche

00:23:15.033 --> 00:23:16.633
county line are you?

00:23:16.633 --> 00:23:18.433
-We're right on the line.

00:23:18.433 --> 00:23:19.933
-You're right on the
line currently.

00:23:19.933 --> 00:23:21.367
And you're about to
proceed northbound

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:22.833
back behind the tornado?

00:23:22.833 --> 00:23:23.833
-That's correct.

00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.467
-And you've been watching this
for quite a little while.

00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:28.800
And what did you estimate
its maximum width was?

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.033
-I would say easily a mile,
and that's kind of being

00:23:32.033 --> 00:23:33.433
conservative.

00:23:33.433 --> 00:23:38.000
Before that, we had two separate
mesocyclones with--

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.367
it looked to be a cone tornado,
and then off to our

00:23:41.367 --> 00:23:44.300
east probably a quarter to a
half mile was a stovepipe

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.600
tornado, a lot of power
flashes with it.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.667
-All right, Darren.

00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:49.467
And I know you've--

00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:49.900
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.633
PROFESSOR: I'm going to stop

00:23:50.633 --> 00:23:53.167
that there for a minute.

00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:55.233
Well, I guess I'll stop
it there anyway.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:57.900
But there are two things I
wanted to point out to you.

00:23:57.900 --> 00:23:59.867
So he's got two things
he's looking at.

00:23:59.867 --> 00:24:04.633
He's got the radar, and he's
looking at the reflectivity,

00:24:04.633 --> 00:24:06.800
which is telling you where
the rain is falling.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:11.233
And in that, he's finding
this shape, which is

00:24:11.233 --> 00:24:12.467
called the hook echo.

00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:18.867
So there's rain falling through
here, and the spin up

00:24:18.867 --> 00:24:23.100
in the cloud is wrapping
this rain shaft around

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.400
in a kind of spiral.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.000
And that's a very clear
signature of a very strong

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
cyclone aloft.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.700
Then he's also got
the Doppler.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:37.933
For the same instrument, the
same radar, it measures the

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:41.567
frequency of the reflected
radar beam.

00:24:41.567 --> 00:24:44.167
And they know what frequency
they sent out.

00:24:44.167 --> 00:24:47.200
If it comes back a higher
frequency, that means the air

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:49.700
at that location is moving
towards you.

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.367
If it comes back at a lower
frequency, it's

00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:52.300
moving away from you.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.500
This is the Doppler effect.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.033
When a car goes by or a train
goes by, you hear that

00:24:58.033 --> 00:24:59.800
[ZOOMING NOISE]

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:02.400
as it's coming towards you and
then going away from you.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.867
There's that frequency shift.

00:25:03.867 --> 00:25:07.100
And what he was showing with
these two regions, one was red

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:11.367
and one was blue, indicating in
one region the wind is away

00:25:11.367 --> 00:25:14.067
from you, in the other region
it's toward you.

00:25:14.067 --> 00:25:19.633
So it probably was like this
if the radar was down here,

00:25:19.633 --> 00:25:23.500
which means there
is a cyclone.

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:24.000
On this side its--you're not

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.467
measuring this other component.

00:25:25.467 --> 00:25:27.267
You're just measuring the
component towards and away

00:25:27.267 --> 00:25:28.067
from the radar.

00:25:28.067 --> 00:25:33.100
But when you see that doublet,
that velocity away from you

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:36.200
and velocity towards you,
there's really only one

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.000
explanation for that.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.933
There's a tight vortex right in
there up in the cloud, and

00:25:40.933 --> 00:25:45.500
very possibly that's causing
a tornado at the ground.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:49.333
So what's nice about that
film loop is that's

00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:50.333
not after the fact.

00:25:50.333 --> 00:25:51.333
That's during the fact.

00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:54.500
So he's putting himself on the
line and saying, listen, I

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.000
know sometimes we have false
alarms about these things, but

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.467
this is one of the strongest
signatures I've ever seen.

00:26:01.467 --> 00:26:06.367
So he's putting out that kind
of warning to the people.

00:26:06.367 --> 00:26:08.667
It's pretty-- it takes some
guts to do that, because

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:12.567
occasionally they do
get this wrong.

00:26:12.567 --> 00:26:17.000
So we're going to continue,
and I think that's--

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.100
yeah, so that's all we have on
severe thunderstorms. Are

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:27.267
there any questions on severe
thunderstorms before we go on

00:26:27.267 --> 00:26:29.000
to another subject?

00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:35.333
So you can read about
it in this book.

00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.000
It's fascinating stuff.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.433
And we'll turn to hurricanes.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.400
Now, a few basic bullet points
about hurricanes.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.700
As with other convective storms,
they get their energy

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.367
from latent heat release.

00:26:51.367 --> 00:26:54.900
In this case, they get
that water vapor

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.133
directly from the ocean.

00:26:57.133 --> 00:27:03.767
So it doesn't-- you don't use
up the water vapor in the

00:27:03.767 --> 00:27:09.667
atmosphere as a tornado begins
to draw on it, because with a

00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:13.233
warm ocean, you can evaporate
water from the ocean just as

00:27:13.233 --> 00:27:15.867
fast as you're drawing
it up in the storm.

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:19.667
So in one way, it's better to
say that really it's the warm

00:27:19.667 --> 00:27:24.867
ocean that provides the fuel
for this, but yet it's also

00:27:24.867 --> 00:27:25.500
water vapor.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.800
The warm water evaporates, and
then you get the water vapor

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.933
that goes up into the cloud.

00:27:30.933 --> 00:27:34.000
And as it rises, you get the
latent heat release and the

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.567
buoyancy and so on
and so forth.

00:27:36.567 --> 00:27:39.733
Now, if you have too
much wind shear--

00:27:39.733 --> 00:27:43.100
this is just the opposite of
the severe thunderstorm.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.900
Severe thunderstorms require
that wind shear to distort it

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.867
and give it that severe
condition, whereas hurricanes

00:27:50.867 --> 00:27:53.233
out over the ocean, if you have
a lot of wind shear, they

00:27:53.233 --> 00:27:54.700
will not form.

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.967
They're a symmetric kind of
deal, and if you try to shear

00:27:58.967 --> 00:28:00.833
that off, you'll just
destroy it.

00:28:00.833 --> 00:28:04.167
So you need a lot of warm ocean
water and not very much

00:28:04.167 --> 00:28:08.300
shear, and then you can, under
some conditions, you can

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.933
generate a hurricane.

00:28:10.933 --> 00:28:12.967
They cannot form at the Equator,
because they have to

00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:17.033
spin one way or the other, and
they get that cue from the

00:28:17.033 --> 00:28:18.800
Coriolis force.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.967
And so if there's no
Coriolis force, you

00:28:20.967 --> 00:28:23.133
cannot form a hurricane.

00:28:23.133 --> 00:28:24.667
So they cannot form
at the Equator.

00:28:24.667 --> 00:28:27.067
And as I mentioned the other
day, they cannot even cross

00:28:27.067 --> 00:28:28.133
the Equator.

00:28:28.133 --> 00:28:30.133
Once they've formed in one
hemisphere, they've got to

00:28:30.133 --> 00:28:31.000
stay in that hemisphere.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.367
They can't suddenly decide to
wander across to the other

00:28:34.367 --> 00:28:34.800
hemisphere.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.800
They couldn't exist with the
spin that they have. They do

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:43.433
spin oppositely in the
two hemispheres.

00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:46.733
Just like in the tornado, the
pressure is very low in the

00:28:46.733 --> 00:28:51.567
center, and that balances the
Coriolis force and the

00:28:51.567 --> 00:28:54.933
centripetal force of the air
spinning around the outside.

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:58.533
So this is a cyclone in the
same sense that I defined

00:28:58.533 --> 00:29:00.967
cyclone for you the other day.

00:29:00.967 --> 00:29:05.600
It's a low-pressure center
with air currents moving

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.600
around it in a cyclonic
direction--

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.867
that is, counterclockwise in
the Northern Hemisphere,

00:29:09.867 --> 00:29:13.300
clockwise in the Southern
Hemisphere.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.867
They occur in the late summer
and early fall in both

00:29:15.867 --> 00:29:17.667
hemispheres.

00:29:17.667 --> 00:29:24.667
Be careful how you use those
terms. On land, the highest

00:29:24.667 --> 00:29:29.367
temperatures normally occur four
to six weeks after the

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:31.000
summer solstice.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.800
The summer solstice
is about June 21.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:40.233
The warmest days of summer are
usually mid-July for air over

00:29:40.233 --> 00:29:41.667
the continents.

00:29:41.667 --> 00:29:45.367
But oceans have more heat
capacity, and they take a

00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:47.767
longer time to warm up.

00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:51.400
So the warmer ocean temperatures
occur almost

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.467
three months after the
summer solstice.

00:29:55.467 --> 00:29:58.833
The warmest ocean temperatures
typically are in August,

00:29:58.833 --> 00:30:00.367
September, and October.

00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:04.433
And since the hurricanes need
that, they need warm ocean

00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:09.767
temperatures, the hurricane
season is then delayed that

00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:10.267
three months.

00:30:10.267 --> 00:30:12.600
So it's not midsummer
or early summer.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.267
It's late summer and early fall,
because that's when the

00:30:15.267 --> 00:30:16.600
ocean's sea surface
temperature--

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.967
SST is the abbreviation for
sea surface temperature--

00:30:20.967 --> 00:30:24.267
is the highest. That
defines the

00:30:24.267 --> 00:30:25.633
so-called hurricane season.

00:30:25.633 --> 00:30:28.300
Now remember, in the Northern
Hemisphere, that is going to

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:33.867
be July, August, September,
and maybe a little bit in

00:30:33.867 --> 00:30:39.433
October, whereas in the Southern
Hemisphere, that is

00:30:39.433 --> 00:30:43.967
going to be, well, January,
February, March, and April in

00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:45.100
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.900
That's their summertime, and
that's when hurricanes are

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.100
going to be most frequent in
the Southern Hemisphere.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:56.067
They tend to drift westward,
because they occur in the

00:30:56.067 --> 00:31:01.167
tropics under the influence
of the trade winds.

00:31:01.167 --> 00:31:04.467
It's like you had a stream of
water and you dip your hand in

00:31:04.467 --> 00:31:07.233
and made a little vortex, and
you would watch and see that

00:31:07.233 --> 00:31:10.867
that vortex is just carried
along by the stream.

00:31:10.867 --> 00:31:13.600
Whatever direction the stream is
going in, that vortex would

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:14.567
move as well.

00:31:14.567 --> 00:31:20.600
And that's primarily what's
going on when tornado is--

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.200
when a hurricane is
moving westward.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.033
However, it also has a poleward
drift that can't be

00:31:26.033 --> 00:31:29.967
explained as simply as that, and
that has something to do

00:31:29.967 --> 00:31:31.233
with the curvature
of the Earth.

00:31:31.233 --> 00:31:33.167
I've published on this,
but I don't have time

00:31:33.167 --> 00:31:33.733
to go through it.

00:31:33.733 --> 00:31:40.633
But there is a drift of
hurricanes toward the pole in

00:31:40.633 --> 00:31:42.133
both hemispheres--

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.933
the North Pole in the Northern
Hemisphere, the South Pole in

00:31:44.933 --> 00:31:46.600
the Southern Hemisphere--

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:51.267
that is added to that general
westward drift due to being in

00:31:51.267 --> 00:31:53.167
the belt of the easterly
trade winds.

00:31:56.233 --> 00:32:01.733
So these are the global
hurricane tracks.

00:32:01.733 --> 00:32:04.967
It's interesting for what is in
this diagram and what's not

00:32:04.967 --> 00:32:05.700
in this diagram.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.667
For example, in the North
Atlantic Ocean--

00:32:09.667 --> 00:32:12.800
the Equator is about here--

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:16.967
generally, hurricanes form in
the central and sometimes even

00:32:16.967 --> 00:32:20.967
eastern part of the tropical
North Atlantic, and then they

00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:22.700
move westward and northward.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.567
So generally, they follow a
looping trajectory like this,

00:32:26.567 --> 00:32:29.933
or maybe they go straight into
the Gulf of Mexico or through

00:32:29.933 --> 00:32:34.300
the Caribbean into the Gulf
of Mexico like that.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:41.033
In the eastern tropical North
Pacific, you have a very high

00:32:41.033 --> 00:32:44.367
density of hurricanes.

00:32:44.367 --> 00:32:47.833
Most of these don't threaten
land, because they're going

00:32:47.833 --> 00:32:51.400
out to sea, but some of them
that move up along the coast

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.400
can threaten land.

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:55.433
They don't go very far north,
because there's a cold

00:32:55.433 --> 00:32:59.600
California Current that
comes down here.

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.533
I didn't put this in the notes,
but you should write it

00:33:01.533 --> 00:33:04.967
down that many people think
there's a critical ocean

00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:08.900
temperature below which you
cannot have hurricanes.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:11.967
And some people will tell you
that's 27 degrees Celsius.

00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:14.367
Some people say it's
28 degrees Celsius.

00:33:14.367 --> 00:33:18.267
But somewhere about there is a
critical ocean temperature.

00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:21.200
And so the ocean has to be
warmer than, let's say, 28

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.533
Celsius before it can
support a hurricane.

00:33:25.533 --> 00:33:28.900
And you don't have that up
here, because the cold

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.033
California Current comes
down, but closer to

00:33:31.033 --> 00:33:32.133
the Equator you do.

00:33:32.133 --> 00:33:35.833
Notice, right at the Equator,
no hurricanes.

00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:40.300
Plenty of warm water, but
no Coriolis force, so no

00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.500
hurricanes.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:48.333
The western tropical North
Pacific is a hotbed-- the

00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:52.467
world's biggest hotbed
of hurricanes.

00:33:52.467 --> 00:33:54.500
Be careful, though.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.967
The word "hurricane"
traditionally is not used in

00:33:58.967 --> 00:34:00.233
that part of the world.

00:34:00.233 --> 00:34:04.900
These are normally referred to
as typhoons, after a Japanese

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:09.067
word for "hurricane." So it
wouldn't be wrong to call

00:34:09.067 --> 00:34:12.767
these hurricanes, but it
wouldn't be the vernacular.

00:34:12.767 --> 00:34:15.033
The vernacular would
be typhoon.

00:34:15.033 --> 00:34:19.167
And so if I say there's a
typhoon in the Western

00:34:19.167 --> 00:34:20.967
Pacific, you'll know
I'm talking

00:34:20.967 --> 00:34:22.933
about a hurricane there.

00:34:22.933 --> 00:34:25.700
And they've got the same kind of
pattern as in the Atlantic.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.167
They go westward, but they
also arc northwards.

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:33.033
In the Indian Ocean, you get
some in the Arabian Sea and

00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:35.067
the Bay of Bengal.

00:34:35.067 --> 00:34:37.100
Not many, but you do
get some, and they

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.767
can be quite damaging.

00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:40.400
In the Southern Hemisphere,
look at this.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:41.800
You get them in the
Indian Ocean.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.567
You get them in the west
tropical Pacific.

00:34:44.567 --> 00:34:49.633
You don't get them in
the east at all.

00:34:49.633 --> 00:34:55.867
And I would've said you don't
get them in the Atlantic, but

00:34:55.867 --> 00:34:57.333
there was one about
four years ago.

00:34:57.333 --> 00:35:01.700
It was the first-ever reported
hurricane in the tropical

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.600
South Pacific, and they've got
that one marked in here.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.367
Now, this is pretty
easy to explain.

00:35:06.367 --> 00:35:08.300
There's a cold current--

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.567
it's called the Humboldt
Current,

00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:12.600
after a German explorer--

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.967
a cold current that comes up
along the coast of South

00:35:14.967 --> 00:35:22.167
America and floods this part
of the southern eastward

00:35:22.167 --> 00:35:24.100
tropical Pacific.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.767
And therefore, the temperatures
are not warm

00:35:25.767 --> 00:35:27.967
enough to support hurricanes.

00:35:27.967 --> 00:35:30.267
And pretty much the same
thing is true here.

00:35:30.267 --> 00:35:33.733
There's a cold current that
comes up along here.

00:35:33.733 --> 00:35:37.500
And while there is some warm air
right-- some water right

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.200
along the Equator, there you
don't have the Coriolis force.

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.533
And here you've got the Coriolis
force, but the

00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:44.600
temperatures are too low.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.667
So you're not getting those two
ingredients together, the

00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:51.367
warm water and the
Coriolis force.

00:35:51.367 --> 00:35:54.300
Questions on this diagram?

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.133
Remember, these are not
occurring simultaneously.

00:35:58.133 --> 00:36:01.200
This is in Northern Hemisphere
hurricane season.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.000
These are in Southern Hemisphere
hurricane season.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.667
We've just put them all together
on one diagram there.

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:15.667
So here's a zoom in of
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:36:15.667 --> 00:36:19.433
And you can see that
many of them come--

00:36:19.433 --> 00:36:22.500
so once a hurricane gets
started, it's going to

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.967
persist. It's a good,
stable storm system.

00:36:26.967 --> 00:36:28.900
It'll persist until
the conditions no

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.033
longer make it possible.

00:36:31.033 --> 00:36:34.000
One of two things will happen.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.467
It'll move over land, in which
case it no longer has that

00:36:37.467 --> 00:36:42.067
water supply, or it'll move over
cold water, in which case

00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:44.400
it no longer has enough
water supply.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:49.867
Because the water can't
evaporate fast enough from a

00:36:49.867 --> 00:36:51.100
cold ocean.

00:36:53.967 --> 00:36:57.900
Typically, from the satellite,
they look like this.

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.867
They have a well-developed,
large cloud shield.

00:37:01.867 --> 00:37:04.867
It's like a thunderstorm anvil,
except it's kind of

00:37:04.867 --> 00:37:05.567
axisymmetric.

00:37:05.567 --> 00:37:09.767
That means moving out
in all directions.

00:37:09.767 --> 00:37:13.267
And very often, but not always,
there's an eye, which

00:37:13.267 --> 00:37:16.067
is a very peculiar
characteristic.

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:20.233
The air everywhere else is
rising, but right there, the

00:37:20.233 --> 00:37:21.900
air is sinking.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:24.033
I know that because it's
clear of clouds.

00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:28.467
Clear of clouds means sinking
air, thermodynamically.

00:37:28.467 --> 00:37:34.500
Underneath this, you can't see
it, but the winds are strong

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.200
in the cyclonic direction.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:41.867
So here's kind of a cartoonish
cross-section.

00:37:41.867 --> 00:37:44.000
You've got these rain bands.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.067
The rain is not uniform in a
hurricane but forms in these

00:37:47.067 --> 00:37:51.033
spiral, heavy-raining bands.

00:37:51.033 --> 00:37:54.800
The air rises in this main
eyewall and then spreads out

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.667
in this giant anvil.

00:37:56.667 --> 00:37:59.333
First, it's still moving in
the cyclonic direction.

00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:02.167
When that air moves far enough
out, the Coriolis force acts

00:38:02.167 --> 00:38:05.733
on it and actually reverses
its sense of direction.

00:38:05.733 --> 00:38:06.433
So be careful.

00:38:06.433 --> 00:38:09.933
If you're looking at movies of
hurricanes, you may find that

00:38:09.933 --> 00:38:14.433
the outer clouds are actually
moving anticyclonically.

00:38:14.433 --> 00:38:15.733
Don't be confused.

00:38:15.733 --> 00:38:20.300
All the rest of the storm is
still a tight, cyclonically

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.900
spinning vortex.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:26.300
And then a little bit of that
air that rises in the eyewall

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.800
sinks right down in the eye and
keeps that little section

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.567
clear of clouds.

00:38:32.567 --> 00:38:36.500
Most of it, however, spreads out
in this giant anvil, whose

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:41.233
diameter is several hundred
kilometers across.

00:38:41.233 --> 00:38:44.100
So hurricane damage, of
course, wind impact on

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.333
buildings and vegetation.

00:38:45.333 --> 00:38:48.700
Remember that the pressure
that a wind exerts on a

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.933
surface is proportional to the
square of the wind speed.

00:38:53.933 --> 00:38:57.667
So if you have a 10 meter per
second wind hitting my house,

00:38:57.667 --> 00:38:59.400
that produces a certain force.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.900
If you have a 20 meters per
second, that's four times--

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.233
twice the speed, but four
times the pressure force

00:39:06.233 --> 00:39:08.033
pushing on the house,
and so on.

00:39:08.033 --> 00:39:12.267
So if you have a hurricane
that's 60 meters per second or

00:39:12.267 --> 00:39:17.633
120 meters per second, the
destructive forces of that

00:39:17.633 --> 00:39:24.500
push really go up very, very
steeply and can destroy most

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.300
buildings, unless they're
specially designed to be

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.700
hurricane-secure.

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:32.133
Another thing is that
storm surge.

00:39:32.133 --> 00:39:37.000
The rapid air movement across
the surface of the ocean

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.267
pushes water towards the shore
and will give an apparent rise

00:39:41.267 --> 00:39:42.233
in sea level.

00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:45.533
We talked about this when we
were discussing Irene.

00:39:45.533 --> 00:39:48.667
And if you're standing on the
beach, the water just suddenly

00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:51.133
seems to rise and move inland.

00:39:51.133 --> 00:39:53.867
On top of that, there's going to
be the waves caused by the

00:39:53.867 --> 00:39:57.567
winds as well, but that storm
surge is often responsible for

00:39:57.567 --> 00:39:59.767
some of the major damage.

00:39:59.767 --> 00:40:02.100
Inland flooding as well, and
we saw that in Irene.

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:05.967
Poor Vermont, and New Jersey to
some extent too, had a lot

00:40:05.967 --> 00:40:09.400
of rainfall, which collected
quickly into the valleys and

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:12.933
rivers and caused a
lot of flooding.

00:40:12.933 --> 00:40:16.967
Of course, for many people here
in Connecticut, the main

00:40:16.967 --> 00:40:19.267
impact of Hurricane Irene
was losing their

00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:21.800
electrical power for days.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:26.633
And that's mostly in this part
of the world, because the wind

00:40:26.633 --> 00:40:30.300
will take down a tree limb and
wipe out most-- in this

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:34.533
country, most of our power
lines are above ground.

00:40:34.533 --> 00:40:38.800
It's cheaper to do that, easy to
maintain in most cases, but

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.867
they're so vulnerable
to tipping trees.

00:40:41.867 --> 00:40:44.367
So when you got a high wind
event like this, trees come

00:40:44.367 --> 00:40:46.933
down, hit the wires.

00:40:46.933 --> 00:40:49.333
You lose both communication
and power.

00:40:49.333 --> 00:40:55.500
In other parts of the world,
hurricanes are often followed

00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:00.667
a few weeks later by enormous
loss of life from disease.

00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:03.700
For example, if you have a
hurricane hitting Bangladesh

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.967
or some of the other undeveloped
countries, what

00:41:07.967 --> 00:41:09.167
you'll have--

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:11.400
the hurricane will be finished
and it'll be

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.400
long gone, and then--

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.800
but people will be displaced
from their homes.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.667
And more importantly, water
sources get mixed.

00:41:18.667 --> 00:41:22.567
So sewage gets into drinking
water typically, and then

00:41:22.567 --> 00:41:23.867
disease begins.

00:41:23.867 --> 00:41:26.200
And in the weeks and months that
follow, you could have

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.567
hundreds, thousands, even tens
of thousands of deaths arising

00:41:30.567 --> 00:41:34.900
from the, quote, "hurricane,"
but it really has to do with

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.033
just contamination of water
supplies and a lack of a

00:41:38.033 --> 00:41:41.300
public health service to be sure
that that sort of thing

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:42.067
doesn't happen.

00:41:42.067 --> 00:41:46.500
So this is the biggest loss of
life from hurricanes by far,

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.300
but these other things are
important as well.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.500
Any questions on that?

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:59.667
So the most famous hurricane in
New England was nicknamed

00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:03.067
the Long Island Express
in 1938.

00:42:03.067 --> 00:42:08.567
It had a track like this and
hit Connecticut directly.

00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:11.067
A lot of damage along the
Connecticut coast, even more

00:42:11.067 --> 00:42:15.533
along the Rhode Island coast.
The hurricane produces its

00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:18.367
biggest damage on the right
front quadrant.

00:42:18.367 --> 00:42:21.800
So it's got four quadrants
based on how it's moving.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.800
It's that right front quadrant
that tends to have the

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.800
strongest winds and in many
cases the heaviest

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.900
precipitation.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.300
And in this case, that hit Rhode
Island and caused a lot

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.533
of damage there.

00:42:33.533 --> 00:42:37.467
If you Google "hurricane, 1938,"
that one will pop up,

00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:39.167
and you can read all about it.

00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:41.667
It really was a major event
and is still talked about

00:42:41.667 --> 00:42:43.067
today in Connecticut.

00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:45.333
We had our own chance at this
just a few weeks ago.

00:42:45.333 --> 00:42:49.433
Hurricane Irene had a track
similar to that but not

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:50.667
exactly the same.

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:54.067
The difference probably was that
it brushed ashore here

00:42:54.067 --> 00:42:59.300
near Cape Hatteras and lost a
lot of its strength before it

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.700
hit New England, partly by its
lack of water vapor over the

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.833
land and also the frictional--

00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:09.367
with all the trees and so on
over land, that friction

00:43:09.367 --> 00:43:09.967
weakened it.

00:43:09.967 --> 00:43:14.800
So by the time it hit us, it had
weakened to a Category 2

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.333
or perhaps even 1.

00:43:17.333 --> 00:43:22.267
And it still caused a lot of
flooding damage but not so

00:43:22.267 --> 00:43:26.333
much wind damage and
other things.

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:29.133
And then of course, the most
damaging hurricane in our

00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:32.267
country's history was
Hurricane Katrina

00:43:32.267 --> 00:43:34.633
in August of 2005.

00:43:34.633 --> 00:43:35.800
And it had a different track.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.800
It started here in
the eastern--

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.500
well, just north of Cuba,
crossed over the southern tip

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.200
of Florida, regained
its strength, and

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.600
then hit New Orleans.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.600
And you can read all about
that in the history books

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:53.033
now-- in history
books now too.

00:43:53.033 --> 00:43:56.467
And there's a picture of Katrina
just as it was about

00:43:56.467 --> 00:44:01.500
to hit New Orleans, a
beautifully formed storm with

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:05.800
a beautiful central eye
and the cloud shield

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.633
and the whole business.

00:44:07.633 --> 00:44:15.733
Very strong storm that
hit New Orleans.

00:44:15.733 --> 00:44:17.733
This is what I mentioned
before.

00:44:17.733 --> 00:44:21.033
There's a well-defined
hurricane season.

00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:25.800
And here it is for Atlantic
hurricanes.

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.200
And of course, when I say
"Atlantic," I'm referring to

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:29.000
North Atlantic.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.800
Because, remember, there are
no hurricanes in the South

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.733
Atlantic, so this is the
Northern Hemisphere hurricane

00:44:34.733 --> 00:44:36.867
frequencies for the
Atlantic Ocean.

00:44:36.867 --> 00:44:41.133
And typically, the frequency
is non-negligible even in

00:44:41.133 --> 00:44:44.467
June, but it begins to rise
quickly at the first of

00:44:44.467 --> 00:44:48.867
August, peaks in early,
mid-September, and then you're

00:44:48.867 --> 00:44:52.600
kind of out of the woods by
the time you get to the

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.067
beginning or the middle
of November.

00:44:55.067 --> 00:45:01.100
And this all has to do with
ocean surface temperatures.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.367
Questions on that?

00:45:08.567 --> 00:45:09.133
Yes.

00:45:09.133 --> 00:45:13.533
Well, it is-- we have five
minutes to go, but rather than

00:45:13.533 --> 00:45:16.933
starting a new subject, why
don't we call it quits today?

00:45:16.933 --> 00:45:21.733
And we'll do mid-latitude
frontal cyclones on Friday.

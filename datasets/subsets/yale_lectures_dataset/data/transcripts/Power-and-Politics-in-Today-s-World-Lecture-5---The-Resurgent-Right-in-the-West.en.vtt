00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.270
- Okay, so today,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.743
we're talking about the
resurgent right in the West.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.580
Let's get fix our intuitions

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.333
with a little walk down memory lane.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.160
- [Ronald Reagan] In Chicago,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.550
they found a woman who holds the record.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.876
She used 80 names, 30
addresses, 15 telephone numbers

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:31.817
to collect food stamps, social security,

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:34.760
veteran's benefits for four non-existent

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.330
deceased veterans husbands
as well as welfare.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.920
Her tax free cash income alone

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.703
has been running $150,000 a year.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.050
- So that was Ronald Reagan

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.040
running for the Republican nomination

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.040
against Gerald Ford in 1976,

00:00:57.552 --> 00:00:59.391
which he was unsuccessful,

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:02.860
and that's his famous
welfare queens speech

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.267
which would become

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:08.060
if things had been able
to go viral in those days,

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.431
it did the paper equivalent of going viral

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:16.180
and it represented this frontal assault

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.671
on the welfare state,

00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.880
on what might be more broadly referred to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.030
as the postwar consensus
that had prevailed

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.030
in almost all of the capitalist
democracies since the 1950s.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.626
In the US, it went by the
name of the Great Society

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:38.100
ushered in by Lyndon Johnson

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.889
which was not only the
civil rights legislation,

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.983
but the creation of Medicare,

00:01:44.983 --> 00:01:49.983
considerable expansion of many components

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.230
of the welfare state.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.430
In Britain, it was of course
the postwar government

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.137
of Clement Attlee voted
into office in 1945

00:02:00.443 --> 00:02:03.296
that put into place the major elements

00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:06.037
of the British welfare state.

00:02:06.037 --> 00:02:10.028
And in many of the
European social democracies

00:02:10.028 --> 00:02:12.190
as they came to be called,

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.610
we got countries that were
marked by strong welfare

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.530
and other forms of social protections

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.280
such as health insurance,

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.578
unemployment insurance, pensions,

00:02:27.578 --> 00:02:29.960
progressive tax systems,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.820
a lot of redistribution
through the tax system,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.510
much more steeply progressive tax systems

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.281
than in any of those countries today.

00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:41.220
And it's important to say

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.900
that the support for
this postwar consensus

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.144
was substantially bipartisan.

00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:48.279
So for example, in Britain

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:53.279
when the Conservatives under Churchill

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.350
came back into power in 1951,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.764
many people said, "Oh,
they're gonna roll back

00:02:59.764 --> 00:03:02.144
"everything that labor has done."

00:03:02.144 --> 00:03:03.820
Not a bit of it actually.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.010
They even expanded it.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.270
And through much of the
1950s, '60s, and '70s,

00:03:11.036 --> 00:03:15.630
you saw in most countries
the recognition of a kind of

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.630
what seemed to be a
substantially bipartisan support

00:03:21.961 --> 00:03:24.540
for this welfare state.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.406
In the US, in the Nixon Administration,

00:03:28.406 --> 00:03:32.880
of course, there was some
pressure for lower taxes,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.330
but still, much of the
welfare state was preserved

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.480
and in some ways it was even expanded.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.928
They got things like,

00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:43.400
which I'll be talking
about later in the course,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.100
such as universal basic income.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.410
Nixon has supported what he
called a negative income tax,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.860
a kind of refundable tax credit.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.416
We've ended up getting something
that's a cousin of that.

00:03:57.416 --> 00:04:01.490
In Europe in countries like Germany

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.816
where they have coalition governments,

00:04:04.816 --> 00:04:07.630
in the '60s and '70s,

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.290
they were basically dominated
by the social democrats.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.605
First, Willy Brandt,
and then Helmut Schmidt.

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:19.227
After in the early '80s,

00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:21.900
for reasons we'll be
talking about next time,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.830
the social democrats got weaker

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.620
and Helmut Kohl's Conservatives took over.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.427
But it was still,

00:04:28.427 --> 00:04:30.945
there was very substantial support

00:04:30.945 --> 00:04:35.945
for European social democracy
across the political spectrum.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.420
For example, in the '60s
and '70s in France and Italy

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.596
where Communist parties
had been very strong

00:04:43.596 --> 00:04:45.690
and had traditionally been

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.360
more Stalinist like Communist parties,

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.800
we had the advent of Euro-Communism.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.359
What was Euro-Communism?

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:55.196
Well, one feature of it

00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:59.090
was that it was denounced
by the Soviet Union

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.845
as revisionist deviationism.

00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:05.113
And the other was that the standing joke

00:05:05.113 --> 00:05:09.940
in Italy in the 1970s
was how can you tell that

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.390
which is the Communist
politician in parliament?

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.420
How do you tell the Communist
from the other politicians?

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.670
And the answer was because
they have more expensive suits.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.410
So the Euro-Communists
again stop pushing this idea

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.284
that social democracy was a way station

00:05:28.284 --> 00:05:32.356
on the way to Soviet style Communism

00:05:32.356 --> 00:05:35.836
and instead was a particular form

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:40.836
of political and social
organization that had come to stay.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.936
And it was seen to be as I said,

00:05:45.936 --> 00:05:49.420
a very broad bipartisan,

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.280
or in Europe, multipartisan consensus.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.283
And this is what starts
to come under attack

00:05:55.283 --> 00:06:00.283
in the late 1970s and early 1980s

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.030
that Reagan is taking dead aim

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.416
at the heart of that consensus

00:06:07.416 --> 00:06:12.416
and the new attack is marked
by hostility to trade unions

00:06:12.643 --> 00:06:14.720
and the welfare state.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.720
It's hostility to progressive taxation

00:06:19.864 --> 00:06:22.300
and hostility to regulation,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.440
the sort of forerunner
of the neoliberalism

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.510
that would be coming later.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.610
And as in Reagan's famous slogan,

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.883
government is not the
solution to our problems.

00:06:33.883 --> 00:06:36.280
Government is the problem.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.475
We have to weaken the power
of government in the economy

00:06:40.475 --> 00:06:43.553
and let the market run.

00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:47.635
This is the basic idea.

00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:50.630
Now, the first thing to say about this

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.540
is when people like Reagan

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.880
and Thatcher came into power in the,

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.880
Reagan got selected in
1980, in the 1980 election.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.690
Margaret Thatcher comes to power in 1979.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.690
She had beaten Edward Heath

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.530
for the Conservative
Party leadership in 1975

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:18.130
in the first competitive
election for a leader

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.207
in the Conservative Party in its history

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:22.880
and people were quite stunned by this

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.243
and she'd been thought to be a minor,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.320
second tier cabinet official

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.690
without much future in the party.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.780
And indeed, I think it was Geoffrey Howe

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:37.360
who said she'll be gone in six months.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.450
Turned out she was leader

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.950
of the Conservative Party for 15 years

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.990
and Prime Minister for
11 and a half years.

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.341
But I think it's fair
to say that most people

00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.987
did not take Reagan
and Thatcher seriously.

00:07:52.987 --> 00:07:55.300
They saw them as real threats,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.271
but most people in the establishment,

00:07:58.271 --> 00:08:01.827
the political establishment,
the economic establish,

00:08:01.827 --> 00:08:05.840
didn't take them seriously
as long term threats.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.120
Those people tended to see this

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.870
as a kind of aberrational outcome

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.020
and that things would revert to normal.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.720
Social democracy was
about alternation in power

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.620
between center right
and center left parties,

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.507
and this was a center right moment,

00:08:22.507 --> 00:08:25.250
but things would revert.

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:27.870
There were a few discordant voices.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.430
In the US perhaps, the most prescient one

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:34.040
was a man by the name of Kevin
Philips who wrote a book,

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.287
published a book in 1969

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:39.970
called "The Emerging
Conservative Majority"

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.970
predicting the rise of the new right

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.740
in pretty much the form that it took.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.466
But he wasn't,

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:50.050
he was later on given great credit

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.780
for having predicted this,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.423
but for the most part,

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:55.960
for the most part,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.050
people did not see this
as any kind of sea change

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.240
or fundamental realignment of politics.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.293
And just to give you a sense in Britain.

00:09:06.293 --> 00:09:11.293
In 1980, the principle
intellectual architect

00:09:13.878 --> 00:09:18.032
of Thatcher's revolution
was Sir Keith Joseph

00:09:18.032 --> 00:09:21.910
and he was her trade and industry minister

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.260
and he was the source of
all her economic ideas

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.740
about monetarism and cutting spending.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.590
And here is Michael Foot

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.920
who is by then the leader of
the Labor Party in opposition

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.980
commenting on Keith Joseph
in the House of Commons

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.340
just to give you a sense of how seriously

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.763
they really took the threat from Thatcher.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.230
- [Michael] I wouldn't like to miss out

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.960
the right honorable gentleman,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.200
the Secretary of State for Industry

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.200
who's had such a tremendous
effect upon the government

00:09:56.343 --> 00:09:58.340
and our politics altogether.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.827
And as I see the right
honorable late gentleman

00:10:01.827 --> 00:10:05.280
walking around the
country looking puzzled,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.808
and forlorn, and
wondering what's happened,

00:10:08.808 --> 00:10:11.570
(audience laughing)

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:16.090
I've often tried to remember
what he reminds me of

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.142
and the other day, I hit upon it

00:10:19.142 --> 00:10:22.220
because I recall that in my youth

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.500
when I used to go in Plymouth,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.820
yes, I know, quite a time ago.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:27.734
(audience laughing)

00:10:27.734 --> 00:10:29.870
You'll come to that one in a moment too.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.770
But I used to go when I lived in Plymouth

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.440
every Saturday night

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.329
along to the Palace Theater

00:10:36.329 --> 00:10:39.483
and the favorite I always
used to watch there

00:10:39.483 --> 00:10:42.305
was a magician conjurer

00:10:42.305 --> 00:10:45.100
and they used to have in the audience

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.361
dressed up as one of the most prominent

00:10:47.361 --> 00:10:49.690
alderman in the place

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.230
a person who was sitting at
the back of the audience.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.020
And the magician conjurer
would come forward

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.376
and say that he wanted
to have from the audience

00:10:58.376 --> 00:11:01.257
a beautiful watch.

00:11:01.257 --> 00:11:03.150
And he would go amongst the audience.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.560
He'd go up to the alderman

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.981
and eventually take off
him a marvelous gold watch.

00:11:08.981 --> 00:11:11.909
And he'd bring it right
back onto the stage.

00:11:11.909 --> 00:11:15.295
He'd enfold it in a
beautiful red handkerchief.

00:11:15.295 --> 00:11:18.860
He placed it on the table
there in front of us.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:22.438
He took up his mallet and he hit it!

00:11:22.438 --> 00:11:26.156
Smashed to smithereens!

00:11:26.156 --> 00:11:30.320
And then on his countenance would come

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.616
exactly the puzzled look
of the right honorable--

00:11:32.616 --> 00:11:34.220
(audience laughing)

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:38.460
And he would step forward,

00:11:43.072 --> 00:11:45.239
and he would step forward.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.807
He would step forward right 'til he,

00:11:50.807 --> 00:11:52.947
he'd step forward right
to the front of the stage

00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:54.963
and he'd say, "I'm very sorry.

00:11:55.952 --> 00:11:57.367
"I'm very sorry.

00:11:57.367 --> 00:11:59.005
"I've forgotten the rest of the trick."

00:11:59.005 --> 00:12:02.005
(audience laughing)

00:12:04.597 --> 00:12:06.547
That's the situation of the government.

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.510
That's the situation of the government.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:12.354
They've forgotten the rest of the trick.

00:12:12.354 --> 00:12:13.465
It doesn't work

00:12:13.465 --> 00:12:16.979
and unless any objector might come along

00:12:16.979 --> 00:12:18.930
and suggest that it was only a trick,

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:22.310
I can assure that at the
Palace Theater in Plymouth,

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.440
the way it was played,

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.300
he used to come along at
the end of the very act

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.550
and say, "I'm very sorry.

00:12:27.407 --> 00:12:29.496
"I've still forgotten the trick."

00:12:29.496 --> 00:12:31.970
That's the situation in this country.

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.670
- So there was Michael Foot
making fun of Keith Joseph

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.520
as a kind of buffoon who
didn't know what he was doing

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.190
and getting lots of positive
reinforcement for that,

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.020
but of course, the joke
really was on Michael Foot.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:48.520
Three years later,

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.220
he ran unsuccessfully
against Margaret Thatcher

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.610
and his election manifesto was called

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.120
the longest suicide note in history

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.680
subsequently by historians.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.820
So the joke was really on Foot

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.818
and he completely
underestimated the staying power

00:13:07.818 --> 00:13:11.940
of what was coming down the pike.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.257
So that's our agenda today

00:13:14.257 --> 00:13:17.347
and we're gonna look at the
sources and implications

00:13:17.347 --> 00:13:21.350
of the resurgence of right wing politics

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.452
across the Western democracies.

00:13:24.452 --> 00:13:27.900
So we're gonna look at
several sources of this,

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.154
one being the collapse of Communism,

00:13:30.154 --> 00:13:31.510
the second being

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.769
embedded in the logic of
distributive politics,

00:13:34.769 --> 00:13:36.410
and the third being

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.360
the changing power
relations in the economy.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.470
And all three of these
things have an influence

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.606
or should have an influence

00:13:44.606 --> 00:13:48.210
on how we think about the
resurgence of the right

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.065
and its political implications.

00:13:51.065 --> 00:13:54.443
And when we think about
its political implications,

00:13:54.443 --> 00:13:58.229
I'm gonna talk briefly
today but more next time

00:13:58.229 --> 00:14:01.440
about those implications
in two-party systems

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.220
like Britain and the US

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.263
versus in multiparty systems

00:14:05.263 --> 00:14:10.263
where like we have on
much of the continent.

00:14:10.325 --> 00:14:15.325
So, let's start with the effects

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.750
of the collapse of Communism.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.350
When the wall came down

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.180
and when the Soviet Union
started disintegrating,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:29.180
many, many intellectuals
and analytical commentators

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.170
thought that this would be good

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.060
for European parties on the left.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:35.464
They thought generally

00:14:35.464 --> 00:14:38.713
that it would be good for two reasons.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.080
One, it made it clear that
European social democracy

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.770
or what we think of as a great society

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.993
kind of political economy in the US

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.800
is not a way station on the future

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:03.800
to some either more statused,
if you like, outcome.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.410
That once we'd think of it

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.416
rather as a kind of permanent equilibrium

00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:13.690
that can be defended on its own terms

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:18.690
and is not something that's
gonna produce something worse.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:23.078
Another way of putting
perhaps the same point

00:15:23.078 --> 00:15:26.330
is it gets rid of the kind of bogeyman

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.860
to mobilize against from the right.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.053
So you know that if you propose

00:15:33.053 --> 00:15:36.590
slight increases in progressive taxation

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.712
or you improve healthcare,

00:15:38.712 --> 00:15:40.714
the notion of that you're trying to do

00:15:40.714 --> 00:15:45.714
is create Communism becomes less credible

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.990
if there's no Communism in
the world left to create.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.980
And many people thought that
with the Communist threat gone,

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.810
the end of the Cold War,

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:56.900
we wouldn't need to mobilize

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.980
against the Soviet Union anymore,

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:03.640
that all of the money that had
been spent on the arms race

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.640
could be plowed back into
the Western economies

00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:12.744
and we were in for a
continuation, if you like,

00:16:12.744 --> 00:16:16.127
of the benign social democracy

00:16:16.127 --> 00:16:20.600
and maybe the power would shift
once more back to the left.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.624
Maybe the right wing governments

00:16:24.624 --> 00:16:27.660
in say in Britain and the US,

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.950
or the fact that power in
Germany had now shifted

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:34.787
as I already said from the
social democrats to the CDU,

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.193
maybe it would shift back.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:44.180
And what all of that failed
to take account of was that,

00:16:45.843 --> 00:16:50.150
and this is really the story
of Tony Judt's book "Postwar,"

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.910
some of which I've put on the syllabus,

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:57.910
is that the social democratic
economies and welfare states

00:16:58.316 --> 00:17:01.610
depended on a very fortuitous arrangement

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.000
of demographic, economic,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.057
and geopolitical
circumstances after the war.

00:17:08.057 --> 00:17:10.120
The demographic one was

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.770
that you had big working age populations

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.283
relative to what we call
dependent populations.

00:17:16.283 --> 00:17:19.500
We think of the dependency ratio

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.820
is the ratio of working age to dependent.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.810
And dependent is defined
under the age of 15

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.483
and above the age of 65.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.730
And of course, what really matters

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.530
from the point of view
of the fiscal health

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.690
of the welfare state is the older crowd

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:40.121
because parents mostly
internalize the cost of children

00:17:40.121 --> 00:17:42.260
whereas governments in turn

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.360
have to bear the cost of elderly people.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.220
And for the most part in
all of these countries,

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.690
we had big working populations

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.826
and relatively small elderly populations.

00:17:54.826 --> 00:17:58.655
That would change as the baby boomer bulge

00:17:58.655 --> 00:18:01.880
worked its way through the population.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.607
And so there's one big
source of fiscal stress

00:18:05.607 --> 00:18:08.540
inexorably coming at all of these systems

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:11.415
as the ratio of working people

00:18:11.415 --> 00:18:15.290
to retired people would increase.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:18.408
Then secondly, much of the economic health

00:18:18.408 --> 00:18:21.565
of these countries had been result

00:18:21.565 --> 00:18:25.990
of the enormous infusion
of funds by the Americans,

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.690
the Marshall Plan in Europe,

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.302
the rebuilding of the Japanese economy,

00:18:30.302 --> 00:18:34.209
and the fact that as I
mentioned to you earlier,

00:18:34.209 --> 00:18:37.353
Europe was not spending
money on its own defense

00:18:37.353 --> 00:18:42.353
so it had the resources to
build up its domestic economies.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:48.164
And that too would go away

00:18:48.164 --> 00:18:52.703
or would start to diminish
as the Cold War ended.

00:18:54.156 --> 00:18:58.706
Also, the American interest
in sustaining these economies

00:18:58.706 --> 00:19:02.301
as bulwarks against the Soviet system

00:19:02.301 --> 00:19:06.800
would start to diminish
as the Cold War ended.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.280
So the idea that European social democracy

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:15.074
was sort of a permanent equilibrium
was by no means obvious.

00:19:15.074 --> 00:19:17.840
It's certainly not in retrospect.

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.610
A second thing to notice

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.794
is that while the bogeymen of Communism

00:19:22.794 --> 00:19:26.334
might not have been there
around which the Conservative,

00:19:26.334 --> 00:19:29.250
the ideological right could organize,

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.760
there are always other potential bogeymen

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:34.871
and particularly as it's
turned out since 9/11,

00:19:34.871 --> 00:19:38.700
Islamic fundamentalism is
an alternative bogeyman

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.770
around which to organize
political movements

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.007
and it has the added advantage

00:19:45.007 --> 00:19:48.083
that it's not a threat
to Democratic capitalism.

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.673
You know, when Islamist regimes,

00:19:51.673 --> 00:19:54.330
when Islamists do come to power

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.560
whether it's in Iran
or Libya under Gaddafi,

00:20:00.559 --> 00:20:03.600
they run capitalist systems badly.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.170
There's no alternative.

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:08.310
There's no Islamist model of the economy.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:13.310
So the idea that one
has to worry about them

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.551
as a threat to capitalism

00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:20.375
in a way that Communism
had once been perceived

00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:22.340
is no longer there.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.080
And that's important because
it diminishes the incentive

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.452
to buy off working class discontent.

00:20:29.452 --> 00:20:33.620
So if you think about,

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:35.242
go back to the new deal,

00:20:35.242 --> 00:20:37.180
after the Depression,

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.510
Communist Party in the
US was quite powerful.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.730
It's very influential in American unions,

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.470
particularly in the CIO.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.713
We had 20% unemployment.

00:20:46.775 --> 00:20:51.775
There was real fear in the
aftermath of the Depression

00:20:52.018 --> 00:20:57.018
that Communism might
claim hearts and minds

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.472
of large numbers of American workers

00:21:00.472 --> 00:21:05.472
and that is partly what
motivated business elites

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:11.150
and others to at least
tacitly support the new deal.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.709
The notion was that you want to make sure

00:21:14.709 --> 00:21:19.709
America's workers do not
reach a state of affairs

00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:24.360
where they think they have
nothing to lose but their chains.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.185
And so my colleague Peter Swenson

00:21:27.185 --> 00:21:30.220
has done tremendous scholarship on this,

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.585
but actually what Swenson shows is that

00:21:32.585 --> 00:21:37.380
there's never been significant
expansion of a welfare state,

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.250
even the European welfare
states by the way,

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.640
without significant at least tacit

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.273
and sometimes active
support from business.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.670
And part of it in the '30s and '40s

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.250
was Keynesian thinking
about revising the economy

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:57.005
or proto-Keynesian thinking.

00:21:57.005 --> 00:21:59.520
The general theory didn't come out

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:02.720
until well after the Depression,

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.726
but there were many people

00:22:03.726 --> 00:22:08.083
making those kinds of
arguments at the time.

00:22:09.115 --> 00:22:10.860
But it was also political.

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.710
It was this idea

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:15.940
that you want to give
the dispossessed people

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.020
who had been most harmed by the Depression

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.420
a stake in the existing order.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.420
And similar arguments were
made in Britain and Europe.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.210
For instance, Ralph Miliband,

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:31.090
the father of Ed and David Miliband

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.883
was a political economist
who published a book

00:22:34.883 --> 00:22:38.022
in the early '60s I believe it was

00:22:38.022 --> 00:22:43.022
called "The Capitalist Industrial State"

00:22:43.396 --> 00:22:44.720
in which he argued

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.250
the welfare state is
capitalism's best friend.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.549
He was a Marxist,

00:22:48.549 --> 00:22:52.881
well to the left even of Ed Miliband,

00:22:52.881 --> 00:22:55.890
and he thought that this was a bad thing

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.070
because it was preventing the workers

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.770
from becoming revolutionary

00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:04.550
because they had this stake
in the existing order.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:09.550
And so this was the notion
that if you don't do this,

00:23:11.252 --> 00:23:13.670
there's an alternative model out there

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:15.580
vying for hearts and minds

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:18.640
and we'd better look out for that.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.770
Once the alternative model has gone away,

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:25.470
once there's no longer a Soviet Union,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.830
it's much easier to discount all of that.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.020
It's much easier to say
well, let's, you know,

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:32.960
you might not say it,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.490
but think move to the suburbs
and build more prisons.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:37.510
It's not obvious

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:41.900
that there's any reason
of the sort that existed

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.270
when there was a Communist
alternative out there

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:50.270
to continue to maintain
expensive welfare states

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.100
that would require
substantial levels of taxation

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.868
and maybe increasing levels of taxation

00:23:56.868 --> 00:24:01.868
given the changes in the demography.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:08.150
So the short of it is that
those who had faith in the idea

00:24:08.402 --> 00:24:10.230
that the end of the Cold War

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.207
was gonna be good for left
of center parties were wrong

00:24:14.207 --> 00:24:15.891
and things have played out

00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:19.238
quite differently since that time.

00:24:19.238 --> 00:24:21.421
So that's our first thing.

00:24:21.421 --> 00:24:26.421
But I want now to turn to
some more analytical thinking.

00:24:26.918 --> 00:24:30.267
Let's put on my analytical hat here.

00:24:30.267 --> 00:24:32.430
Some more analytical thinking

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.010
about the logic of distributive politics

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:39.180
because I think people
don't think clearly enough

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.425
about just what that logic is

00:24:42.425 --> 00:24:46.225
when they think about what's gonna happen

00:24:46.225 --> 00:24:50.030
in different political scenarios.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:54.039
So this is a famous picture of a hat

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:56.560
from the beginning of "The Little Prince,"

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.800
Antoine de Saint-Exupery.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.155
And as you might recall,

00:25:01.155 --> 00:25:03.840
it's the very beginning of the book.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.048
He decides he wants to frighten the adults

00:25:07.048 --> 00:25:08.892
and he's gonna frighten the adults

00:25:08.892 --> 00:25:10.890
by drawing a picture

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:14.780
of a boa constrictor eating an elephant.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.620
So he does.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.886
And he's absolutely devastated

00:25:18.886 --> 00:25:23.886
when the adults say, "That's
a nice hat you've drawn."

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.840
And he's furious.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.150
So he has to draw another
picture showing the elephant,

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.373
a sort of X-ray.

00:25:33.532 --> 00:25:35.457
But he's so despondent

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.130
that he decides to abandon
his career as an artist

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.930
and instead become a
pilot which he duly does.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:48.536
Now, one thing we can
know about this story

00:25:48.536 --> 00:25:51.880
is that the adults he
was trying to frighten

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.289
were not economists

00:25:53.289 --> 00:25:56.210
because had they been economists,

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.550
he might have been able to frighten them

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.985
with this picture because
instead of not seeing,

00:26:01.985 --> 00:26:03.885
instead of seeing it as a hat,

00:26:03.885 --> 00:26:05.200
they might have seen it

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.213
as a picture of the income distribution.

00:26:08.124 --> 00:26:13.124
And in particular, this feature
of the income distribution

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.532
which is that the median income

00:26:16.532 --> 00:26:19.813
is always below the mean income.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.940
Why would that be?

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:25.623
Why is the median income
always below the mean?

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.861
Yup.

00:26:28.861 --> 00:26:30.609
- [Male Speaker] (mumbles) there are

00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:33.070
some extremely rich people.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.520
- Very rich people, right?

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.640
The very rich people out here.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.620
In fact, you know,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.063
Gates, and Soros, and these,

00:26:39.063 --> 00:26:41.260
they're probably on the other side

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.780
of (mumbles) Street down
there actually, right?

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.250
And so that pulls up the average, right?

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.640
So that means that in every,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.473
you know,

00:26:49.473 --> 00:26:51.520
obviously there's a cut off point here

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:56.520
because there's some level below
which people won't survive,

00:26:56.757 --> 00:27:00.080
but the very rich people
pull up the average

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:05.080
so there are always more people
below the average income.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.690
And so this had for a long
time led political economists

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:18.140
to think that politicians who
are trying to win election

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.430
will be responsive the median voter

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:24.485
and there'd sorta be a kind of impetus

00:27:24.485 --> 00:27:26.880
to redistribute downwardly

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:30.260
because politicians need votes,

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.200
they need to get elected,

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.553
and so they will do that.

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.748
This median voter is gonna
be below the mean income.

00:27:38.748 --> 00:27:42.130
And indeed, this is a very old argument.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.792
So for example in the 19th century,

00:27:44.792 --> 00:27:47.420
people like John Stuart Mill were afraid

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.400
of expanding the franchise
for exactly this reason.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.630
And they came up with things

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:55.090
like giving two votes
to university graduates

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.400
as a way to sort of blunt it.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.700
And Karl Marx after he'd
been disappointed in 1830

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.010
when Communism had not arrived

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.520
and he'd been disappointed in 1848

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.890
when the revolutions
had not become Communist

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:12.958
and he'd been disappointed
in the Paris commune in 1871,

00:28:12.958 --> 00:28:15.070
he and Engel started talking about

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.420
the parliamentary road to Socialism.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.097
And this was exactly the same idea

00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:22.980
that maybe the workers would
do through the ballot box,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.670
what they had not done at the barricades.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.750
And the 20th century's ideas

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.992
the median voter theorem
which basically says

00:28:31.992 --> 00:28:36.992
that politicians in
search of the median voter

00:28:37.929 --> 00:28:40.813
are gonna support downward redistribution.

00:28:40.813 --> 00:28:44.600
A very famous paper by two
people called Meltzer and Richard

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.637
which I think is somewhere

00:28:45.637 --> 00:28:48.060
in the recommended
readings on the syllabus.

00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.120
If not, it should be.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.120
And so the biggest puzzle of
20th century political economy

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.740
is that this does not in fact happen.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.580
That there's lots of redistribution

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.163
in Democratic capitalist systems,

00:29:05.222 --> 00:29:07.603
but it's all kinds of distribution.

00:29:07.603 --> 00:29:12.603
It can be from urban to
rural sectors of the economy.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.341
It can be from one industry to another.

00:29:18.341 --> 00:29:21.140
It can be done through food subsidies.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.950
It can be done in all kinds of ways,

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.250
but there's sometimes,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.570
there's regressive redistribution
in capitalist systems.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.264
We'll talk later about the
repeal of the estate tax

00:29:30.264 --> 00:29:33.296
which is an example of
using the political system

00:29:33.296 --> 00:29:36.052
to actually redistribute in ways

00:29:36.052 --> 00:29:38.275
that produce more inequality.

00:29:38.275 --> 00:29:40.984
And so that being the case

00:29:40.984 --> 00:29:43.720
that the sort of standard expectations,

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.290
the folk expectations that
once you've got majority rule

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:50.100
with the universal franchise,

00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.931
the poor are gonna soak the rich.

00:29:51.931 --> 00:29:53.595
Why wouldn't they?

00:29:53.595 --> 00:29:54.920
They've got less.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.430
They're gonna soak the
rich, but it doesn't happen.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:59.420
And so people have tried to understand

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.663
why that doesn't happen

00:30:01.663 --> 00:30:04.140
and there are basically two approaches

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:05.840
to thinking about that.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.393
So, one would be to say well,

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:14.700
I've got one dimension here.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.980
The left wing party wants redistribution.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.922
The right wing party
doesn't want redistribution

00:30:19.922 --> 00:30:24.922
and the median voter's
gonna want redistribution

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.640
and so the right wing party

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.360
is gonna sorta be dragged to the left

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.727
in search of the median voter
or it's gonna lose, right?

00:30:32.727 --> 00:30:36.060
But what if there's
another dimension as well?

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.936
What if there's a dimension like race?

00:30:38.936 --> 00:30:42.450
So what if there's a
dimension where people

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:46.210
have racially exclusionary attitudes

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.836
versus inclusionary attitudes?

00:30:48.836 --> 00:30:52.430
And then it might be the case that well,

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.390
then it depends how much
they compare about race

00:30:55.390 --> 00:31:00.390
versus how much they care
about income or wealth, okay?

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.403
And so this is the story

00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:06.680
of Richard Nixon's
southern strategy, right?

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.940
So what happens.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.410
1964, you get the Civil Rights Act.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.655
1965, we get the Voting Rights Act.

00:31:14.655 --> 00:31:19.655
Lyndon Johnson is famously
reputed to have said,

00:31:20.267 --> 00:31:22.821
"Democrats have lost the
South for a generation.

00:31:22.821 --> 00:31:26.343
"I've lost the South for the
Democrats for a generation."

00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:29.340
Historians now debate
whether he actually said it,

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.003
but it was widely attributed to him.

00:31:32.003 --> 00:31:35.930
And the notion was that
the Democrats historically

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:40.930
had been the dominant party in the South

00:31:41.731 --> 00:31:46.731
and now that they had become associated

00:31:46.798 --> 00:31:50.530
with the Civil Rights Act,
the Voting Rights Act,

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.423
there was gonna be backlash

00:31:52.423 --> 00:31:56.210
and Nixon and his advisors

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.010
thought he could
capitalize on that backlash

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.300
by offering to essentially
limit the effects

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:08.300
of the Voting Rights and
Civil Rights Act in the South,

00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:09.573
stop that,

00:32:09.573 --> 00:32:13.793
and that would make,

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.250
this would be the way

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:21.320
in which the Republicans
could attract voters

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.900
who had previously supported the Democrats

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.410
for economic reasons.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:29.387
And so once you put a
second dimension into play,

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.046
if you like,

00:32:33.046 --> 00:32:36.760
it's no longer the case
that the median voter

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.180
will necessarily want
downward redistribution

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.073
because they may want preservation

00:32:41.073 --> 00:32:45.640
of their racial status quo more.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.910
And so this is one of the
ways in which scholars.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.410
My colleague in the
Political Science Department,

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.560
John Roemer has developed
a number of these models

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.670
that show this.

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.867
Once you put a second
dimension whether it,

00:32:58.867 --> 00:33:00.560
I'm just putting race here.

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.960
It could be xenophobia.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.443
It could be women's rights.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.750
There might be another dimension.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:10.640
Again, you think about women's rights.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:15.640
Women may think the
pro-choice pro-life dimension

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:20.420
more important than the economic dimension

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.290
and so vote differently.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.840
So once you put other
dimensions into play,

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:29.650
maybe the median voter won't
vote for redistribution.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:34.293
So that's one possible story
about why we have not seen

00:33:34.293 --> 00:33:39.293
the sorts of developments
that one might anticipate.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.793
Here's another story.

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.510
So this is what game theorists refer to

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.940
as the majority rule divide a dollar game.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.100
And here, the intuition is

00:33:56.100 --> 00:34:01.100
that if you divide a
dollar by majority rule,

00:34:04.272 --> 00:34:07.160
no matter how you divide it,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.784
there is some potential
majority to upset that division.

00:34:11.784 --> 00:34:15.643
So if you think if they start
out with an equal division,

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.287
you can see here that Stannis and Arya

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:29.417
can decide to completely
dispossess Joffrey

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.651
and keep it all to themselves.

00:34:32.651 --> 00:34:36.456
But of course, if we think of
things going around over time,

00:34:36.456 --> 00:34:39.450
then what if Joffrey's gonna come along

00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:43.035
to Arya and say, "I'll
offer you a different deal.

00:34:43.035 --> 00:34:47.127
"You can keep 2/3 of it or 60% of it

00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:50.022
"and I'll take 40% of it, all right?"

00:34:50.022 --> 00:34:51.880
And if that were the case,

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.043
if that became the new status quo,

00:34:55.463 --> 00:34:59.013
Stannis would come up and
propose something else.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:03.700
And this could go on, and on, and on.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:08.040
And what the finding is
is that it never ends.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:13.040
So that if you have majority rule

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.673
dividing up any divisible good over time,

00:35:16.673 --> 00:35:18.652
there is no distribution

00:35:18.652 --> 00:35:22.920
that in principle is not susceptible

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.223
to being upset by some new majority.

00:35:27.079 --> 00:35:29.060
So notice a couple of things

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:32.890
about the majority rule
divide a dollar game

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:35.800
that are very important
for us going forward.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.130
The first is you don't need
a second dimension here

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.565
to get instability, right?

00:35:40.565 --> 00:35:43.010
Maybe there's a second
dimension, maybe there isn't,

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:44.180
but it's not necessary

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.760
to have a second dimension
to get instability.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.760
You can get instability
with one dimension, right?

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.653
Just money.

00:35:52.653 --> 00:35:57.020
This whole game is just about money.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.837
And that carries a further implication

00:35:59.837 --> 00:36:03.424
which is that interests alone

00:36:03.424 --> 00:36:06.290
will not produce effective demand

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.380
for dominant redistribution

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:12.010
or for retaining any
particular distribution.

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.770
Now, we're gonna be bringing into play

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:17.700
the framework of interests,
ideals, and institutions

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.293
that I mentioned to you last week.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:21.963
And notice here

00:36:21.963 --> 00:36:25.720
I'm not just talking about
interests as selfish.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.510
For example, the three people

00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.990
playing the divided dollar game.

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:33.600
Maybe one wants to give the
money to save the whales.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.566
One wants to give the
money to soup kitchens

00:36:36.566 --> 00:36:41.566
and one wants to spend
it protecting wolves

00:36:42.046 --> 00:36:46.340
as my friend Nicoly up there
would probably want to do.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:50.470
So they try to maximize
their share of the pie,

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:52.441
but we're not saying they're
selfish people, right?

00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:54.550
But all we're saying is that

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.886
if they want to maximize
their share of the pie,

00:36:57.886 --> 00:37:01.205
the interest in maximizing
is not gonna be enough

00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:04.360
to sustain any particular distribution

00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.450
because if it's just that,

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:08.840
there will always be
someone who will come along

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.980
and offer you a better deal, right?

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.600
So interests alone are
not gonna be sufficient

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.770
to get people to support
any particular distribution

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.018
including, of course,

00:37:21.018 --> 00:37:26.018
distribution from the
average to the median voter.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.286
So if interests alone are not enough,

00:37:30.286 --> 00:37:33.920
let's think about the other two concepts.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.370
Let's think about ideals.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.320
So what we're really saying is

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:43.851
in order for the median voter

00:37:43.851 --> 00:37:46.330
to achieve downward redistribution,

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.530
all these people have to vote together.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.610
All of these people to
the left of this line

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:52.304
have to vote together, right?

00:37:52.304 --> 00:37:57.190
Because if the wealthy
can buy off the poor

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:59.572
with bread and circuses

00:37:59.572 --> 00:38:02.840
and make the middle class pay for it,

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.130
you can get a coalition

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:06.462
of the rich and the poor
against the middle class

00:38:06.462 --> 00:38:10.470
or you can (mumbles) 2017 tax cuts.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.940
You give a small cut to
the people at the bottom,

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.730
a huge cut to the people at the top.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:17.940
People in the middle
internalize the cost of that.

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:20.950
Again, it's a majority rule,

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.382
it's a majority coalition.

00:38:23.382 --> 00:38:26.350
It's not gonna be downward redistributive.

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:29.670
So all of these people
would have to vote together.

00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:33.421
So they'd have to some ideals
we can think about first

00:38:33.421 --> 00:38:36.981
to get them to vote together.

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:40.624
So what ideals might there be?

00:38:40.624 --> 00:38:45.624
So one ideal obviously is
what people think is fair.

00:38:46.364 --> 00:38:47.950
People think, you know,

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.936
what is a fair distribution?

00:38:49.936 --> 00:38:53.513
Maybe you can motivate them with that.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:59.140
So here's the next question
is well, what is fairness?

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.013
Well, here's one answer to that.

00:39:02.071 --> 00:39:04.822
- So a final experiment that
I want to mention to you

00:39:04.822 --> 00:39:07.083
is our fairness study.

00:39:07.083 --> 00:39:11.000
So what we did is we put two
Capuchin monkeys side by side.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.610
Again, these animals,
they live in a group.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.443
They know each other.

00:39:13.443 --> 00:39:15.593
We take them out of the group,
put them in a test chamber.

00:39:15.593 --> 00:39:19.740
And there's a very simple
task that they need to do

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.220
and if you give both of
them cucumber for the task,

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:24.600
the two monkeys side by side,

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.290
they're perfectly willing to
do this 25 times in a row.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:28.410
So cucumber even though

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.960
it's really only water in my opinion,

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.260
but cucumber is perfectly fine for them.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.550
Now, if you give the partner grapes.

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:38.700
The food preferences
of my Capuchin monkeys

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:41.800
correspond exactly with the
prices in the supermarket.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.989
And so if you give them
grapes as a far better food,

00:39:44.989 --> 00:39:48.190
then you create inequity between them.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:50.050
So that's the experiment we did.

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:51.123
Recently, we videotaped it

00:39:51.123 --> 00:39:52.998
with new monkeys who
had never done the task

00:39:52.998 --> 00:39:55.200
thinking that maybe they
would have a stronger reaction

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.750
and that turned out to be right.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.480
The one on the left is the
monkey who gets cucumber.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.200
The one on the right is
the one who gets grapes.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.290
The one who gets cucumber,

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.300
note that the first piece of
cucumber is perfectly fine,

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:08.107
the first piece she eats.

00:40:08.107 --> 00:40:10.410
Then she sees the other one getting grape

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:11.910
and you will see what happens.

00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:14.010
So she gives a rock to us.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:14.960
That's the task

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.480
and we give her a piece of
cucumber and she eats it.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.480
The other one needs to give a rock to us

00:40:21.626 --> 00:40:22.943
and that's what she does.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.630
And she gets a grape and she eats it.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.620
The other one sees that.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.073
She gives a rock to us
now, gets again cucumber.

00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:38.951
(audience laughing)

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:54.190
She tests the rock now against the wall.

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:58.203
She needs to give it to us
and she gets cucumber again.

00:41:01.074 --> 00:41:04.074
(audience laughing)

00:41:07.917 --> 00:41:10.320
So this is basically
the Wall Street protest

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:11.452
that you see here.

00:41:11.452 --> 00:41:14.452
(audience laughing)

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:21.820
- So what he finds there
with the Capuchins is a very,

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.820
he's studied it in many,
many, many social animals

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.542
and there's plenty of psychology

00:41:28.542 --> 00:41:32.568
to support the idea that
human beings are the same.

00:41:32.568 --> 00:41:35.670
However, he fundamentally

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:39.063
misinterprets the result of his study.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:45.180
Anyone think why do we say he
misinterprets the implication,

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.843
he doesn't see what this implies?

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.430
Yeah.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.500
No?

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.993
It's not the Wall Street protestor

00:41:56.993 --> 00:42:00.750
because what infuriates this monkey

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.893
is that another monkey just
like it is getting more.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.050
The monkey's not bothered

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:10.640
that the researcher has a bowl

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:15.640
full of cucumbers and grapes, right?

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.650
This is a very robust finding

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:24.325
in the social psychology
literature about people.

00:42:24.325 --> 00:42:29.325
Their sense of the word welfare
is often other regarding,

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.780
but they make relatively
local comparisons.

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:35.500
They do not compare themselves to people

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.171
very different from themselves

00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:40.667
in the socioeconomic distribution.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.440
So where steel workers

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.430
might compare themselves to auto workers

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:54.338
or coal miners might compare themselves

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:56.720
to people working in oil fields.

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.110
And this is true, by the way,

00:42:58.110 --> 00:43:02.480
up and down the occupational scale.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.380
So a professor will be
much angrier to discover

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:10.030
that he or she earns $5,000 less

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.820
than the professor in the next office

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:17.610
than to discover that he
or she earns $500,000 less

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:19.950
than the attorney who lives next door.

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:24.760
People tend to make
relatively local comparisons

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.490
and later on when we come
to populism and all that,

00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.970
we'll discuss the implications of that

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.150
in the politics that
we're seeing right now.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:36.201
And so the point to make here

00:43:36.201 --> 00:43:41.201
is that people don't
make global comparisons.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.280
They tend to compare people
to people like themselves.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.640
Now, you could say.

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.473
Yeah?

00:43:48.473 --> 00:43:50.730
- Is it only by occupation?

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:52.860
- No, not necessarily.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.250
I mean, there's studies
of children for example.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:57.709
You give a little boy a
half a glass of orange juice

00:43:57.709 --> 00:44:00.650
and then you give his sister a full glass

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:01.740
and he was happy before.

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.357
Now, he's furious, right?

00:44:03.357 --> 00:44:06.843
So it depends what your
reference group is.

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:11.055
Paul Bloom who gave the Devane Lectures

00:44:11.055 --> 00:44:12.650
about four or five years ago

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:15.681
is the local expert on reference groups,

00:44:15.681 --> 00:44:19.300
but it doesn't have to
be in the same industry.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.100
It's got to be the kind of people

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.720
you consider yourself to be like

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.563
and by whom you want to
be given esteem, right?

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.423
So now, you might say,

00:44:32.423 --> 00:44:36.380
well, that's not necessarily
fatal for solidarity

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:39.473
because if you say well,

00:44:41.785 --> 00:44:45.610
I want to have at least
as much as people like me.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:47.620
You could say well, let's get together

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:49.700
and make sure we all get it, right?

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.050
So it's not obviously fatal to solidarity.

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:56.580
And that's basically what Marx's theory

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.191
of consciousness raising was about.

00:44:59.191 --> 00:45:00.750
But the trouble is

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:04.170
that it competes with
other ideals of fairness.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.090
So let's just consider a couple

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.153
that are relevant to where we're headed.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:12.033
- Next Tuesday is election day.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.257
Next Tuesday, all of
you will go to the polls

00:45:15.257 --> 00:45:17.130
and stand there in the polling place

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.613
and make a decision.

00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:22.050
I think when you make that decision,

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.446
it might be well if you would ask yourself

00:45:24.446 --> 00:45:28.973
are you better off than
you were four years ago?

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:31.390
Is it easier for you to go

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:32.830
and buy things in the stores

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.973
than it was four years ago?

00:45:34.973 --> 00:45:37.985
Is there more or less
unemployment in the country

00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:39.980
than there was four years ago?

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.370
And if you answer all
of those questions yes,

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.175
why then I think your
choice is very obvious

00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:45.793
as to who you will vote for.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.950
- So there, he's saying
something quite different.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:55.610
He's saying ask yourself.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:46:00.049
This is Ronald Reagan in
1984 running for re-election.

00:46:00.049 --> 00:46:04.350
He's saying four years ago
when I came into office,

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.710
some here can remember
what it was like in 1980.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.560
Interest rates were at 19%.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.823
Inflation was 12 or 13%.

00:46:13.356 --> 00:46:16.530
The economy was in pretty bad shape

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:18.530
and by 1984, things were better.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.370
So he's saying you look
at your circumstances now

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:24.960
compared to four years ago
and are you better off or not?

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:28.100
This is what we might call a
self referential comparison.

00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.530
It has nothing to do

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.386
with what other people are getting, right?

00:46:32.386 --> 00:46:37.386
And it's not important
from your point of view

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:43.500
Reagan is anticipating what
other people are getting.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:46.910
And this is what economists call

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:48.971
a Pareto improvement, right?

00:46:48.971 --> 00:46:51.650
Economists are all about absolute gains,

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.027
not about relative gains.

00:46:53.027 --> 00:46:54.920
People want to get on as high

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.710
an indifference curve as they can

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:58.630
in standard economic models

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:01.229
without reference to
the indifference curves

00:47:01.229 --> 00:47:03.750
that others might be on.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.680
Just to take the same
logic across the channel,

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.783
here's another formulation of it.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.150
- There is no doubt that the
Prime Minister has in many ways

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:16.396
achieved substantial
success for the economy.

00:47:16.396 --> 00:47:18.399
(people exclaiming)

00:47:18.399 --> 00:47:20.387
There is one statistic

00:47:20.387 --> 00:47:23.716
that I understand is not
however challengeable

00:47:23.716 --> 00:47:26.980
and that is that over her 11 years,

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.357
the gap between the richest 10%

00:47:29.357 --> 00:47:32.350
and the poorest 10% in this country

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.094
has widened substantially.

00:47:34.094 --> 00:47:34.927
- [Male Speaker] That's right.

00:47:34.927 --> 00:47:35.760
- How can she say

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.950
at the end of her chapter
of British politics

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:40.120
that she can justify

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:43.020
many people in the
constituency such as mine

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:45.380
being relatively much poorer off,

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.718
much less well housed,

00:47:46.718 --> 00:47:51.718
and much less well provided
than it was in 1979?

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.575
Surely, she accepts that is not a record

00:47:54.575 --> 00:47:58.020
that she or any Prime
Minister can be proud of.

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:02.360
- Mr. Speaker, all levels
of income are better off

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.960
than they were in 1979,

00:48:05.207 --> 00:48:08.410
but what the honorable member is saying

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:12.330
is that he would rather
the poor were poorer

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:15.120
provided the rich were less rich.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.903
Once they start to talk about the gap,

00:48:16.903 --> 00:48:19.900
they'd rather the gap were that,

00:48:22.138 --> 00:48:23.471
down here, that.

00:48:24.886 --> 00:48:25.719
Not that,

00:48:28.451 --> 00:48:29.284
but that.

00:48:29.284 --> 00:48:31.130
- [Male Speaker] That's it.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:34.491
- So long as the gap is smaller,

00:48:34.491 --> 00:48:35.486
so long as the gap

00:48:35.486 --> 00:48:36.995
is smaller--
- Order!

00:48:36.995 --> 00:48:39.583
- They'd rather have the poor poorer.

00:48:42.649 --> 00:48:44.980
- So you know, there it is.

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:49.980
Two fundamentally antithetical
conceptions of fairness.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:55.133
So how should we think about
the contest between them?

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.113
Which is more powerful
politically, do you think?

00:49:03.103 --> 00:49:05.486
Or maybe that's the wrong way to put it.

00:49:05.486 --> 00:49:09.320
What are the conditions under which

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:11.360
one might become more
powerful than the other?

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.623
Any reflections on this?

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.550
Yeah.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.650
We're gonna give you the microphone, yeah.

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:30.128
Do you want to give it to him?

00:49:30.128 --> 00:49:30.961
Yeah.

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:38.303
- [Male Speaker] Can everyone hear me?

00:49:38.303 --> 00:49:39.429
Yes.
- Yeah.

00:49:39.429 --> 00:49:41.240
- [Male Speaker] It
brings back to the mean

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:44.622
and average income we saw previously.

00:49:44.622 --> 00:49:47.440
If you have more people that have less,

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.340
then politically you're
gonna have more people

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.180
who are going to vote for the income.

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:56.640
- So just run with that a little bit.

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:59.760
So if you were designing a party platform

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.760
trying to appeal to more
solidarity based idea

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.393
of getting more people

00:50:07.393 --> 00:50:12.393
to resist the Reagan
and Thatcher logic here,

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:14.893
what would your argument be?

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.690
- [Male Speaker] To resist
Thatcher and Reagan?

00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:23.930
My main argument would
be we're all born equal.

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:27.110
We need to earn the same thing.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:29.973
There's no reason why
other people gain more.

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:32.943
- Okay and now, if you had to,

00:50:33.914 --> 00:50:38.710
if you had to bet in an upcoming election

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.030
that you were right,

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:42.080
how much of your own money would you bet?

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.140
- [Male Speaker] This is taking
the country to my opinions,

00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:51.145
but I think there's a good
chance it will be successful

00:50:51.145 --> 00:50:55.390
in the next 15 months unfortunately.

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:56.223
- Okay.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:02.630
You think the people's basic conception

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:06.324
of a solidarity based
conception of fairness

00:51:06.324 --> 00:51:10.149
can actually command people's support

00:51:10.149 --> 00:51:15.149
despite the appeals to what we might call

00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:19.073
an economist conception
of absolute improvements?

00:51:20.552 --> 00:51:21.930
Any other arguments

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:24.580
that somebody could imagine making

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:26.153
in support of that notion?

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:31.080
Yes, sir.

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:32.843
You need the microphone, yeah.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.640
- [Male Speaker] Since
the Reagan administration,

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:47.230
there has been no real growth
in wages of the middle class.

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:48.063
- Mm-hmm.

00:51:48.063 --> 00:51:51.120
- [Male Speaker] And all
the additional productivity

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:52.680
has gone to the upper class.

00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:54.010
So I think that is something

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:56.960
that you could use as a political
argument that would work.

00:51:57.995 --> 00:52:00.043
- So how would you make the argument?

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:05.570
- That life is not better than it was

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:07.960
50 years ago for most of the people.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.073
That if anything, your
salary is the same and your,

00:52:16.391 --> 00:52:19.820
and the likelihood of you
keeping your salary is less.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:20.770
You're less secure

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:24.360
and you're at the same level
that you were 30 years ago.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.710
- Okay, so I see you oscillating now

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.780
between two logics here.

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:32.249
One is you're saying the
world's become more unequal

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:34.580
and the other is that you're saying

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:37.070
people are becoming more insecure, right?

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:39.540
So those two things are not the same

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:42.160
and they gotta be importantly different.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.880
And what I'm gonna be
arguing later in the course

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.640
is that when people become insecure,

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.560
there's a very different politics.

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.200
Insecurity is not the
same thing as inequality.

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.580
People can be afraid of insecurity

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:59.953
even if they're relatively well
off if they feel threatened.

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:05.820
Fear of insecurity produces
a very different politics

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:11.700
than outrage at inequality.

00:53:11.700 --> 00:53:14.508
And what's going on here

00:53:14.508 --> 00:53:19.207
is that if you look at the
Reagan and Thatcher arguments,

00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:23.050
in addition to being
completely self referential.

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:23.940
They're just saying,

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.440
they're both saying why
should the poor care

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:28.290
what the rich have

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:31.410
if the poor are better
off than they were before

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:34.550
or at least as good as?

00:53:34.550 --> 00:53:37.860
So they're basically
appealing to two things.

00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:40.273
One is absolute improvement's

00:53:40.273 --> 00:53:43.870
more important than relative changes.

00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:46.297
And the other is that people, again,

00:53:46.297 --> 00:53:51.129
they then are appealing for
prospects for upward mobility.

00:53:51.129 --> 00:53:53.278
They're saying you, you know,

00:53:53.278 --> 00:53:56.280
Reagan famously said I want an America

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.216
where anybody can become
a millionaire, right?

00:53:59.216 --> 00:54:02.130
People should be able to get ahead.

00:54:02.130 --> 00:54:04.775
Now, and that was certainly a difference

00:54:04.775 --> 00:54:08.900
between the politics of
the new right in the 1980s

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:14.949
and the politics of conservatism
pro-market arguments today

00:54:14.949 --> 00:54:18.926
which revolve more
around what psychologists

00:54:18.926 --> 00:54:21.960
and economists call loss aversion.

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:26.960
It's no longer a politics about
promising upward mobility.

00:54:27.009 --> 00:54:29.589
It's actually a politics revolving around

00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:31.874
as you said wages have stagnated

00:54:31.874 --> 00:54:34.810
and perhaps in real
terms, actually gone down.

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:36.573
People are more insecure.

00:54:37.488 --> 00:54:42.176
Make America great again
is a slogan which implies

00:54:42.176 --> 00:54:47.130
that something's been taken away from you

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:49.080
and I'm gonna bring it back, right?

00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.150
It's a very different notion than

00:54:52.294 --> 00:54:54.520
America's best days lie ahead.

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.230
Now, it's interesting that Reagan

00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:59.112
was responsible for both those slogans.

00:54:59.112 --> 00:55:00.850
Make America great again

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:04.345
and America's best days lie ahead.

00:55:04.345 --> 00:55:09.345
And in 2016, Trump used the first

00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:12.380
and Hillary used the second.

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:14.050
But of course, the context in which

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:18.049
Hillary was talking about
America's best days lie ahead

00:55:18.049 --> 00:55:19.890
had been an era when we had

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:23.550
had 304 decades of wage stagnation

00:55:23.550 --> 00:55:25.060
and growing economic insecurity.

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:27.336
So it was a very different era

00:55:27.336 --> 00:55:32.333
than when Reagan and Thatcher
were running in the 1980s.

00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:36.610
But those are more contextual things.

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.710
I want to just make some more basic points

00:55:39.710 --> 00:55:42.401
about the logic of distribution here

00:55:42.401 --> 00:55:47.401
which is what Thatcher's
success was keying off of

00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:52.743
was this wonderful line
from the Times obituary

00:55:52.743 --> 00:55:54.970
of Benjamin Disraeli.

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.110
He died in 1891.

00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:57.943
I don't know why

00:55:57.943 --> 00:55:59.630
it took them two years
to write the obituary,

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:00.767
but they said,

00:56:00.767 --> 00:56:04.667
"He discerned the conservative
nature of the working man

00:56:04.667 --> 00:56:06.487
"in the same way as a sculptor

00:56:06.487 --> 00:56:09.920
"discerns an angel in a block of marble."

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.357
So what Disraeli,

00:56:12.357 --> 00:56:15.690
he basically understood this logic

00:56:15.690 --> 00:56:19.709
of what we might call divide a guinea

00:56:19.709 --> 00:56:21.640
rather than divide a dollar,

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:25.295
but that there was plenty
of reasons to think

00:56:25.295 --> 00:56:29.210
that you could appeal
to working class voters

00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:32.420
to support conservative policies.

00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:37.300
And one of the, I think,

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.970
enduring myths on the intellectual left

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:44.610
is that when poor people

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:47.280
don't support redistributive politics,

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.170
they're somehow acting
against their own interest.

00:56:50.170 --> 00:56:53.160
Sort of what's the matter
with Kansas, right?

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:53.993
Thomas Frank.

00:56:53.993 --> 00:56:55.770
Why are these people voting

00:56:55.770 --> 00:56:58.345
in ways that are not in their interest?

00:56:58.345 --> 00:56:59.863
Even setting aside

00:56:59.863 --> 00:57:03.240
whether there's a second
dimension like race

00:57:04.177 --> 00:57:06.660
which might be part of the story

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.900
but it might not be part of the story,

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:13.570
being promised minor
incremental improvements

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:14.806
might be sufficient

00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:18.740
to get people to support
a political program

00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:22.730
without reference to
what others are doing.

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:25.080
And I think the other thing to say.

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.730
You could say okay,

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.784
these are two competing
conceptions of fairness.

00:57:29.784 --> 00:57:33.280
It's not obvious why one will
win rather than the other,

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.260
but the difficulty is
that it's much harder

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:40.954
to hold a solidaristic coalition together

00:57:40.954 --> 00:57:43.070
precisely because all you have to do

00:57:43.070 --> 00:57:48.070
is start picking off some
people from that coalition

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.330
until you've got enough.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:55.330
So even if 40, or 50, or
60% remain in solidarity

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:58.644
with this basic conception of fairness,

00:57:58.644 --> 00:58:02.600
if you could promise
upward mobility to others,

00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.450
that might be enough.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:05.917
Or if you could promise

00:58:08.271 --> 00:58:11.930
at least repairing the
losses that they've had,

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:16.880
maybe subsidies for the
industries in which they work,

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.930
that might be enough.

00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:20.780
And again, we'll talk much more

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.690
about populism since 2016 later,

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:29.690
but notice that Donald Trump in no rally,

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:31.270
in no campaign speech,

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:33.363
in no piece of campaign literature

00:58:33.363 --> 00:58:37.760
ever said he was gonna reduce
the inequality in America.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.850
He said, "I'm gonna bring
industrial jobs back."

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:43.017
He said, "These people are corrupt

00:58:43.017 --> 00:58:44.570
"and they've been screwing things up,"

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:48.250
but he did not promise
to reduce inequality.

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:52.120
He promised to give people
absolute improvements

00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:54.859
or at least prevent them from experiencing

00:58:54.859 --> 00:58:58.550
further absolute losses period.

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:03.300
So it makes it harder, we might say,

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:06.110
all else equal, it's harder to sustain

00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:08.601
solidaristic conceptions of fairness

00:59:08.601 --> 00:59:11.852
because that's a coalition

00:59:11.852 --> 00:59:15.220
that can be picked apart in different ways

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:19.925
and all it takes is getting enough people

00:59:19.925 --> 00:59:22.300
to support what you want to do

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.353
and it starts to disintegrate.

00:59:25.801 --> 00:59:28.010
And that's what Thatcher did basically.

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.100
She appealed to lower
middle class workers,

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:33.230
shop keepers, and working class voters

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.672
with upwardly mobile aspirations

00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:40.550
and comparable things happened
elsewhere in the 1980s.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:42.200
So the upshot is

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.943
that even without a second
dimension like race,

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:51.042
solidarity is always
vulnerable to splintering

00:59:51.042 --> 00:59:52.791
by these ideology,

00:59:52.791 --> 00:59:56.490
by these other ideologies

00:59:56.490 --> 00:59:59.840
or people promising to pick off somebody

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.124
by promising them absolute gains

01:00:02.124 --> 01:00:06.983
or something better as part
of some different coalition.

01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:13.400
So it sounds like ideals
of fairness are not enough.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.386
They might help build a coalition

01:00:16.386 --> 01:00:19.360
and they might motivate
people some of the time,

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.830
but they're probably not gonna be enough.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:24.273
So what about institutions?

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.790
What institutions could there be

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:31.730
that would sustain a solidaristic,

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:35.478
what I'm calling here a
solidaristic conception

01:00:35.478 --> 01:00:40.340
that would get people to support
single political platforms

01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.510
that might at least
prevent regressive change

01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:46.790
or promote progressive change?

01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:48.143
Unions, yeah.

01:00:48.143 --> 01:00:53.143
They seem like the obvious
candidate 'cause unions,

01:00:54.494 --> 01:00:59.494
unions are basically organizations

01:01:00.308 --> 01:01:02.940
that will pull together the people

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:06.060
to the left of the median voter.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:11.060
So let's take a look at
what we think about unions.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.149
- [Male Speaker] Sam Donaldson, ABC News--

01:01:17.149 --> 01:01:20.189
- [Male Speaker] A strike
by air traffic controllers.

01:01:20.189 --> 01:01:22.730
From the President, a strong warning.

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:24.702
They are in violation of the law

01:01:24.702 --> 01:01:28.464
and if they do not report
for work within 48 hours,

01:01:28.464 --> 01:01:32.520
they have forfeited their
jobs and will be terminated.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.360
- [Male Speaker] From the
union, a defiant response.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.418
- The controllers out there

01:01:36.418 --> 01:01:38.657
firmly believe in what they are doing

01:01:38.657 --> 01:01:41.100
and we will continue the strike.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.837
(orchestral music)

01:01:44.837 --> 01:01:48.320
- [Male Speaker] From ABC,
this is World News Tonight

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.020
with Peter Jennings at the
foreign desk in London.

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.350
And from our desk in
Washington, Frank Reynolds.

01:01:54.350 --> 01:01:55.390
- Good evening.

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:56.380
The strike began as scheduled

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.270
at seven o'clock local time this morning.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:01:59.890
Its impact was immediate.

01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:02.690
Most flights delayed, many more canceled,

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:03.930
but there was no delay

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:05.910
in the reaction of the federal government

01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:07.740
led by the president himself.

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:09.650
We have a series of reports tonight.

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:12.483
First, here is White House
correspondent Sam Donaldson.

01:02:14.070 --> 01:02:15.730
- [Sam] Four hours after the strike began,

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:18.470
President Reagan described
the aides as very angry

01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:19.430
and very determined

01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:21.640
to serve notice on the
air traffic controllers

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:24.870
that they had better return
to work quickly or else.

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:27.580
- Government cannot close
down the assembly line.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:30.050
It has to provide without interruption

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:31.300
the protective services

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.497
which are government's reason for being.

01:02:33.497 --> 01:02:35.223
It was in recognition of this

01:02:35.223 --> 01:02:37.533
that the Congress passed a law

01:02:37.533 --> 01:02:40.062
forbidding strikes by government employees

01:02:40.062 --> 01:02:42.107
against the public safety.

01:02:42.107 --> 01:02:45.137
It is for this reason
that I must tell those

01:02:45.137 --> 01:02:48.710
who fail to report for duty this morning,

01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:50.852
they are in violation of the law

01:02:50.852 --> 01:02:54.800
and if they do not report
for work within 48 hours,

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.500
they have forfeited their
jobs and will be terminated.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.350
- [Sam] Strong as the
threat of firing may be,

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:01.420
the administration moved rapidly

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.370
to employ other weapons as well.

01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:05.780
Court proceedings to force
the strikers back to work

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:08.010
were begun in 19 separate courts.

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:10.780
Criminal charges were being
prepared against individuals.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.230
The first cases would be
brought against union leaders,

01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:16.620
but FBI agents are compiling
a complete list of strikers.

01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.030
The union's three and a half
million dollar strike fund

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:20.602
has been impounded by court order

01:03:20.602 --> 01:03:22.084
and a petition has been filed

01:03:22.084 --> 01:03:24.254
asking for decertification of the union

01:03:24.254 --> 01:03:27.170
meaning to put it out
of business permanently.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:30.230
The President was asked why
such strong action immediately?

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.550
Why not some lesser action to begin with?

01:03:32.550 --> 01:03:34.860
- What lesser action can there be?

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:37.356
The law is very explicit.

01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:39.670
They are violating the law.

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:41.669
- The President is said by
an aide to be tough as nails

01:03:41.669 --> 01:03:44.000
in his determination to break this strike.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.160
And this morning, Mr. Reagan
reminisced in the Oval Office

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.262
about Calvin Coolidge's
similar determination

01:03:48.262 --> 01:03:52.043
and success in breaking the
Boston Police strike of 1919

01:03:52.043 --> 01:03:54.960
when Coolidge was
governor of Massachusetts.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.780
In this case, Mr. Reagan wanted to make

01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.240
the deadline for firing 24 hours at first.

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.861
He finally settled on 48

01:04:00.861 --> 01:04:02.140
in order to make certain

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.160
that no air traffic
controller could say later,

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.780
he didn't get the word.

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:08.200
The President seems convinced
that by being tough,

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.010
he can force many of the
union members back to work.

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.160
He also seems convinced

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.020
that being tough is what the public wants.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.617
Sam Donaldson, ABC News, the White House.

01:04:17.617 --> 01:04:21.150
- And he did indeed fire
those air traffic controllers.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:24.372
Let's go forward three years in the UK.

01:04:24.372 --> 01:04:27.110
- Mr. Chairman, what we have
seen in the past few weeks

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:29.393
is not picketing at all.

01:04:30.282 --> 01:04:33.730
It is an attempt by
force to prevent others

01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:36.851
from doing what they have a right to do.

01:04:36.851 --> 01:04:40.018
(audience applauding)

01:04:43.856 --> 01:04:45.439
It is intimidation.

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:48.722
It is unlawful assembly.

01:04:48.722 --> 01:04:53.722
Our duty demands and the
national interest requires

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.930
that we see that violence does not pay

01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:59.115
and is seen not to pay.

01:04:59.115 --> 01:05:02.282
(audience applauding)

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.410
Let violence cease.

01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:09.496
Let the law be kept.

01:05:09.496 --> 01:05:13.137
That is the spoken and unspoken hope

01:05:13.137 --> 01:05:17.363
and wish of millions
of our fellow citizens.

01:05:18.955 --> 01:05:22.949
- So those two confrontations
were emblematic

01:05:22.949 --> 01:05:26.730
of the gloves coming off with
the rise of the new right

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:31.730
when Ronald Reagan fired the
air traffic controllers in 1981

01:05:32.007 --> 01:05:34.730
and Margaret Thatcher took on the miners

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:39.080
who had been striking through
much of the 1970s in Britain

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:43.683
and broke the miner's union.

01:05:43.683 --> 01:05:47.796
And this signaled a start
of a very different attitude

01:05:47.796 --> 01:05:52.796
toward unions on the part
of right of center parties.

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:58.060
And many people sort of
date the big change here

01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.951
to those governments

01:05:59.951 --> 01:06:04.810
and those particular sort
of symbolic confrontations.

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:09.570
But the truth is that that
was the tip of an iceberg

01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:12.410
that has a much longer provenance.

01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:15.129
So if you look at union
membership in the US,

01:06:15.129 --> 01:06:20.129
you can see this starts
from, goes from 1973 to 2009,

01:06:21.294 --> 01:06:23.833
and it basically falls in half.

01:06:23.833 --> 01:06:28.682
And if you take out public sector workers,

01:06:28.682 --> 01:06:33.682
it's overall union membership
falls even more dramatically.

01:06:36.370 --> 01:06:37.610
You can see here

01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:44.270
that private sector unions
have all but disappeared.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:48.010
But what do these numbers ignore?

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:51.053
What do these graphs not tell us?

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:53.750
Most people know that.

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:56.620
Most people know that since the 1970s,

01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.785
unionist rates,

01:06:57.785 --> 01:07:00.500
unions have gotten a lot smaller.

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.333
Yeah?

01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:03.095
- [Male Speaker] There are
a lot of jobs going away.

01:07:03.095 --> 01:07:04.490
- Yup, that's true,

01:07:04.490 --> 01:07:05.323
but what else,

01:07:05.323 --> 01:07:07.363
what do these numbers not tell us?

01:07:08.684 --> 01:07:13.360
What they don't tell us is
it's not since the 1970s.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.212
It's since the 1950s

01:07:15.212 --> 01:07:18.831
that the high watermark
of union membership

01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:22.108
in the US economy

01:07:22.108 --> 01:07:27.108
is really in the late
1940s and early 1950s.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:32.500
The Wagner Act protecting unions

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:35.010
had been passed in 1935

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:38.190
as part of FDR's new deal legislation

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:43.190
and had had very tepid opposition
from business initially

01:07:44.224 --> 01:07:48.250
partly because of the fears of Communism,

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:49.854
but that rapidly changed

01:07:49.854 --> 01:07:52.810
once it became obvious that the US economy

01:07:52.810 --> 01:07:56.954
was not gonna disappear,
was not gonna collapse.

01:07:56.954 --> 01:07:59.325
And through much of the 1940s,

01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:01.460
there was a lot of lobbying

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.480
to either get rid of
Wagner or cut it back.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:09.480
And in 1947, Republican Congress
passed the Taft-Hartley Act

01:08:10.713 --> 01:08:15.630
which over President
Truman's veto by the way,

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:19.110
so it was a very powerful
Republican Congress did that,

01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:21.440
takes 2/3 in both houses,

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.640
and Taft-Hartley cut back on
a lot of union protections.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.346
So part of it was the politics,

01:08:27.346 --> 01:08:31.466
but we've seen as America has transformed

01:08:31.466 --> 01:08:36.000
from a manufacturing
to a services economy,

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.690
it's become less and less unionized

01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:40.850
partly for those sorts
of political reasons

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.470
and part because it's much harder

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:46.325
to organize service sector
than it is manufacturing,

01:08:46.325 --> 01:08:48.684
and mining, and things like that,

01:08:48.684 --> 01:08:51.460
and partly because more recently,

01:08:51.460 --> 01:08:54.800
the advent of free trade.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:58.987
The fact that capital is
back to the Hirschman point,

01:09:01.525 --> 01:09:05.380
capital has many fewer
exit costs than labor.

01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.820
Capital is more mobile than labor,

01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:12.640
so capital can leave at
much lower cost than labor.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:15.513
Think about what I said
about different exit costs

01:09:15.513 --> 01:09:18.610
being important when we
talked about Hirschman.

01:09:18.610 --> 01:09:20.260
And those exit costs for capital

01:09:20.260 --> 01:09:22.290
have come down, and down, and down,

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:25.494
and so we saw last time

01:09:25.494 --> 01:09:27.620
if they can't make enough money in China,

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.390
they just move to Vietnam.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:32.900
And then they'll go to
Cambodia or some place else.

01:09:32.900 --> 01:09:35.430
So you've got low exit cost for capital,

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.251
higher exit cost for labor.

01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:42.251
And so that makes it very
difficult to sustain unionization.

01:09:42.387 --> 01:09:47.051
And this as somebody said
when we were talking about,

01:09:47.051 --> 01:09:49.793
this has a lot to do,

01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:53.204
the red line there is
a share of the income

01:09:53.204 --> 01:09:55.027
going to the top 10%

01:09:55.027 --> 01:09:58.125
and the blue line is the
decline in unionization

01:09:58.125 --> 01:09:59.507
since the '50s.

01:09:59.507 --> 01:10:00.730
And as you can see,

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:04.057
as unions get smaller and smaller,

01:10:04.057 --> 01:10:07.043
the inequality is growing.

01:10:07.976 --> 01:10:11.380
And somebody else mentioned
as this has happened,

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.770
we've seen a declining share of income

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:15.350
going to the middle class.

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:17.050
Again, I'll post these slides

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:20.891
and you can look at them at your leisure.

01:10:20.891 --> 01:10:24.663
And this is not only the case in the US.

01:10:26.926 --> 01:10:29.850
You won't be able to see these probably,

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:33.520
but these are all countries
in which a different.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.658
You'll be able to see
them when I post them.

01:10:35.658 --> 01:10:37.120
They're all countries

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:41.690
in which the proportion of the work force

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:47.030
has declined over the
last several decades.

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:49.310
And they're all the major economies.

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:51.730
Unions have become smaller and weaker.

01:10:51.730 --> 01:10:53.360
There are a few exceptions,

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.886
places like Belgium, Chile, Mexico.

01:10:55.886 --> 01:10:58.592
It's more or less remained flat.

01:10:58.592 --> 01:11:02.160
It seems like Finland is about
the only country in the world

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:06.304
in which unionization rates
have actually increased.

01:11:06.304 --> 01:11:08.519
And so what are the implications of that?

01:11:08.519 --> 01:11:12.730
The implications of that are that unions

01:11:12.730 --> 01:11:14.651
which as the gentleman here said

01:11:14.651 --> 01:11:17.712
are probably the best
institutional component

01:11:17.712 --> 01:11:22.480
for creating solidarity among voters

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:24.250
to vote for certain platforms

01:11:24.250 --> 01:11:27.923
are decreasingly well equipped to do that.

01:11:27.923 --> 01:11:31.330
And particularly, it has
been conventional wisdom

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:33.092
that in two-party systems,

01:11:33.092 --> 01:11:36.775
the unionized workforce
is relatively small

01:11:36.775 --> 01:11:41.775
so it's not gonna be able to
get a lot of redistribution.

01:11:43.369 --> 01:11:48.157
And so this is a picture
of inequalities in the US,

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.293
the UK, Germany, and France
over the past century.

01:11:54.293 --> 01:11:56.760
For all countries, it's this U shape.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.776
So we go from the gilded
age to where we are now

01:11:59.776 --> 01:12:02.560
more or less in this U shape

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:07.560
with the more equality in
the middle of the century.

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:09.625
But as you can see,

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:12.763
the U is deeper in the US and the UK

01:12:12.763 --> 01:12:14.730
which have two party systems

01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:17.088
and it's shallower in France and Germany

01:12:17.088 --> 01:12:19.717
which have multiparty systems.

01:12:19.717 --> 01:12:24.702
And this has been a source
of the conventional wisdom

01:12:24.702 --> 01:12:26.700
that two-party systems

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.814
are less redistributive
to the median voter

01:12:29.814 --> 01:12:31.760
than multi-party systems.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:36.380
This has been conventional
wisdom for a very long time.

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:41.380
And part of the reason here
is as the left of center party

01:12:42.562 --> 01:12:46.718
is less and less connected
to a powerful union movement,

01:12:46.718 --> 01:12:49.600
there's gonna be less demand on it

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:53.560
to deliver those kinds of
redistributive changes.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.680
And indeed, there's scholarship

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.730
mostly from 20 or 30 years ago

01:12:57.730 --> 01:13:00.470
suggesting that multi-party systems

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:03.470
are more responsive to the median voter

01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:06.323
in the policies that they actually enact.

01:13:07.192 --> 01:13:10.200
Whether that is in fact true anymore

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:12.367
is what we'll talk about next time.

01:13:12.367 --> 01:13:13.723
See you on Tuesday.

01:13:16.972 --> 01:13:19.389
(calm music)

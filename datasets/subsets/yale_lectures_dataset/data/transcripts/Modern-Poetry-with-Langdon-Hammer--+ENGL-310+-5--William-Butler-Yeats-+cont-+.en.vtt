Professor Langdon
Hammer: In our first Yeats

00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:11.554
lecture, I was talking about
Yeats's early development and

00:00:11.554 --> 00:00:15.787
stylistic transformation over
the course of,

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:20.710
roughly, a twenty-,
twenty-five year period.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.878
Yeats has a long career,
really beginning in the late

00:00:26.878 --> 00:00:29.370
nineteenth century.
 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:37.125
The poems that matter the most
to us today are those that he

00:00:37.125 --> 00:00:43.960
starts publishing around 1915,
or 1914, and later.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.097
But he's really in the middle
of his literary career at that

00:00:50.097 --> 00:00:54.856
point.
I suggested in looking at that

00:00:54.856 --> 00:01:03.100
early development that Yeats is
seen as a kind of representative

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.989
figure who somehow moves out of
symbolism,

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:12.792
out of a kind of ornate
aestheticism,

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:16.489
towards a kind of heroic
realism.

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:22.058
But I insisted instead that,
in fact, the way to understand

00:01:22.058 --> 00:01:27.242
that development is really a
transition from one set of

00:01:27.242 --> 00:01:33.856
symbols to another,
as exemplified by the movement

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:41.494
between "Aengus" and "The
Fisherman" in Yeats's early

00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:42.670
work.
 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.129
 
 

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:50.174
The little poem,
"A Coat," that poem about that

00:01:50.174 --> 00:01:55.890
stylistic transformation about
the enterprise of walking naked,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.990
well, it's a poem that reminds
us that Yeats's development was,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.254
as he understood it,
conditioned by his relationship

00:02:08.254 --> 00:02:11.608
to his audience.
Yeats, I said,

00:02:11.608 --> 00:02:17.283
wanted to speak for and to the
Irish people,

00:02:17.283 --> 00:02:23.620
as well as to explain Ireland
and Irishness to an

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.240
English-speaking world abroad.
 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.444
At the same time,
even as he has a kind of

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:39.410
intense identification with the
Irish people,

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.877
he also, in that little poem
and in other poems,

00:02:43.877 --> 00:02:47.300
fears being betrayed by the
crowd;

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:56.530
fears being sold cheap;
complains of his reception.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.337
Last time, I alluded to Yeats's
involvement in the Abbey

00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:05.400
Theater, beginning in 1904.
 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.997
This is an important phase of
his career, when with the help

00:03:10.997 --> 00:03:16.973
of Lady Augusta Gregory and John
Synge, Yeats tries to establish

00:03:16.973 --> 00:03:19.629
an Irish national drama.
 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.475
Synge's play,
The Playboy of the Western

00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:28.510
World--which you may know
-- it was set in the Aran

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.439
Islands, in Western Ireland.
 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.860
This was a kind of turning
point in the movement.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.662
Misunderstood as a satire on
the Irish peasantry,

00:03:41.662 --> 00:03:48.190
Yeats's production of the play
led to riots in 1909.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.623
This is one of the events,
I think, that Yeats is thinking

00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:57.212
about in "The Fisherman" when he
speaks of "great Art beaten

00:03:57.212 --> 00:04:01.330
down."
The audience that Yeats

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.721
distains and turns away from in
the teens is,

00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:11.743
importantly,
a middle class,

00:04:11.743 --> 00:04:16.044
urban audience,
and that attitude of

00:04:16.044 --> 00:04:23.910
Yeats's--it's a motif we find in
other poets that we'll read,

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.801
and I'd like you to note it;
an attitude that we'll see in

00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:34.540
Pound, in Eliot,
in different ways.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.997
The displacement of
aristocratic and peasant

00:04:39.997 --> 00:04:44.440
cultures by an urban
bourgeoisie,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.149
by the Dublin theater-going
audience, the people at the

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:56.675
center of a new mongrel,
modern culture -- well,

00:04:56.675 --> 00:05:02.224
these are the people that Joyce
depicts so memorably in the

00:05:02.224 --> 00:05:05.189
daily life of Leopold Bloom.
 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:10.048
Yeats is a very different
writer and has a different

00:05:10.048 --> 00:05:14.525
relation to the world of Joyce's
Ulysses,

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:18.697
for example.
Yeats has a kind of hostility

00:05:18.697 --> 00:05:22.440
towards this ascendant
middle-class world,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.918
and a hostility that you can
view as a kind of anti-modernism

00:05:27.918 --> 00:05:33.309
or anti-modernness,
that is again an important

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:35.769
component in Yeats.
 

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:40.310
Or maybe the right way to say
it would be that Yeats's sense

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.403
of his own modernity,
of what it means for him to be

00:05:46.403 --> 00:05:54.906
modern, emerges in defiance of
certain new social formations

00:05:54.906 --> 00:06:02.309
and also through a fantasy,
I say, identification with the

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:07.851
aristocracy and with the
peasantry, with these cultures

00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:12.470
rooted in rural Irish society of
the past.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:18.091
Like Pound, like Eliot,
from a political and social

00:06:18.091 --> 00:06:22.926
point of view,
you could say that Yeats is a

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:28.776
reactionary modernist,
turning away from the ascendant

00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:33.970
social forms of the present
towards an idealized past.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.509
Or, rather, you could say Yeats
seems to want to do this,

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:45.445
seems to want to turn away from
the present -- expresses the

00:06:45.445 --> 00:06:48.683
desire to.
In fact, however,

00:06:48.683 --> 00:06:54.678
Yeats's eyes remain really
fixed in a kind of horror and

00:06:54.678 --> 00:07:00.783
fascination on the cataclysmic
events of his time and the

00:07:00.783 --> 00:07:07.105
political life of his time in
which he is himself very much

00:07:07.105 --> 00:07:10.955
involved.
Yeats is, in fact,

00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:17.389
a far less nostalgic thinker
than either Eliot or Pound,

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.250
at least as I understand them.
 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.949
The stance that I'm trying to
describe, which is a kind of

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:33.590
ambivalent and complicated one,
emerges powerfully in the poem

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:40.480
"Easter, 1916," on page 105 in
this book.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.770
And I'd like to spend some time
with that, with you.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:53.170
 
 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:08:00.051
"Easter, 1916."
The subject of this poem is the

00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:05.678
Easter Uprising,
the Irish Republican challenge

00:08:05.678 --> 00:08:12.283
to English domination that
briefly established an Irish

00:08:12.283 --> 00:08:18.381
state led by Padraig Pearse,
who, along with,

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:25.468
in fact, all but one of the
leaders of the insurrection,

00:08:25.468 --> 00:08:30.435
was executed.
These events have a--still have

00:08:30.435 --> 00:08:35.216
a kind of central and powerful
place in modern Irish

00:08:35.216 --> 00:08:39.448
consciousness.
If you go to Dublin and you

00:08:39.448 --> 00:08:44.528
enter the post office,
one of the important scenes of

00:08:44.528 --> 00:08:51.403
the rebellion,
you find great wall paintings

00:08:51.403 --> 00:09:00.931
of scenes from the rising,
almost like Stations of the

00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:04.988
Cross.
Well, Dublin is an interesting

00:09:04.988 --> 00:09:09.947
place to be with this poem in
mind, partly because you realize

00:09:09.947 --> 00:09:14.418
when you are there that
it's--the city center is a small

00:09:14.418 --> 00:09:16.761
one,
and that, well,

00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:22.350
Yeats's house is--was not far
from the post office;

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:30.396
and the world that he's writing
about is something very intimate

00:09:30.396 --> 00:09:35.250
and familiar,
of which he is a part.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.471
And that is,
in fact, one of the important

00:09:38.471 --> 00:09:41.300
points of departure for this
poem.

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:45.392
He says:
I have met them at close

00:09:45.392 --> 00:09:48.510
of day
Coming with vivid faces

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:54.389
From counter or desk among grey
Eighteenth-century houses.

00:09:54.389 --> 00:10:02.120
[Dublin, "them" being the
revolutionaries.]

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.550
I have passed with a nod of the
head

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:10.090
Or polite meaningless words,
Or have lingered awhile and said

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.600
Polite meaningless words,
And thought before I had done

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.900
Of a mocking tale or a gibe
To please a companion

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:23.830
Around the fire at the club,
Being certain that they and I

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:31.900
But lived where motley is worn:
All changed, changed utterly:

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.230
A terrible beauty is born.
 

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:45.255
["Motley" signifying their
Irishness, as if Yeats and these

00:10:45.255 --> 00:10:48.684
men
and women he speaks of shared

00:10:48.684 --> 00:10:54.839
only their Irishness.]
In the second strophe of this

00:10:54.839 --> 00:11:01.769
poem he proceeds to talk about,
to isolate individuals,

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:08.298
particular figures of the
revolt, which your editor

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:13.389
identifies at the bottom of the
page.

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:15.650
That woman's days were
spent

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.810
In ignorant good will,
Her nights in argument

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.830
Until her voice grew shrill.
 

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.440
What voice more sweet than hers
When young and beautiful,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.780
She rode to harriers?
 

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.720
This man had kept a school
And rode our winged horse;

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.730
This other his helper and friend
Was coming into his force;

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.400
He might have won fame in the
end,

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:50.060
So sensitive his nature seemed,
So daring and sweet his thought.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:54.880
This other man I had dreamed
A drunken, vain-glorious lout.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:59.376
He had done most bitter wrong
To some who are near my heart,

00:11:59.376 --> 00:12:02.230
[Maude Gonne]
Yet I number him in the song;

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:06.419
He, too, has resigned his part
In the casual comedy;

00:12:06.419 --> 00:12:08.780
He, too, has been changed in
his turn,

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:16.470
Transformed utterly:
A terrible beauty is born.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:21.850
 
 

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:26.734
Yeats is describing his
interaction with and his

00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:32.554
distance from Pearse and the
others in that first stanza,

00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:35.360
and then in the second.
 

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.184
He's saying something like,
"I used to see these people all

00:12:40.184 --> 00:12:44.640
the time.
I was proud, however.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:48.000
I kept myself apart from them.
 

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.419
I felt we had nothing in common
but "motley," our Irishness.

00:12:53.419 --> 00:12:58.980
But all that is changed by
events.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.813
They have become political
martyrs to the future Irish

00:13:04.813 --> 00:13:10.867
state, and I am obliged to
remember and honor them in my

00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:14.720
poetry, even those I disdained.
 

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:21.414
My poetry, which"--well,
the dedication to which had

00:13:21.414 --> 00:13:28.110
defined Yeats's difference from
them up till now.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:36.994
The poem's extraordinary
refrain, "a terrible beauty is

00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:44.070
born," returns in the poem like
a chorus,

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:52.111
like the voice of some kind of
abstract and impersonal chorus,

00:13:52.111 --> 00:13:59.230
and it suggests almost a
strangely impersonal event,

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:04.129
something that happens without
agents making it happen.

00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:10.179
"A terrible beauty is born" --
a passive construction.

00:14:10.179 --> 00:14:15.823
Take the first part of the
refrain first:

00:14:15.823 --> 00:14:20.480
"All changed,
changed utterly."

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:25.190
"All changed, changed utterly."
 

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:29.335
I think there are really three
strong metrical accents in a row

00:14:29.335 --> 00:14:29.870
there.
 

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.720
 
 

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:40.562
By "all," that three letter
word, a highly Yeatsian word,

00:14:40.562 --> 00:14:47.894
a word Yeats loves to use --
you'll see him use it often --

00:14:47.894 --> 00:14:54.121
Yeats means "all of them,"
"all of those people," "all the

00:14:54.121 --> 00:14:56.600
people I've been describing."
 

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:04.290
He also means "my relation to
them," "the way I kept myself

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.809
apart from them."
 

00:15:06.809 --> 00:15:12.204
He also means "all:
everything, plain and simple,"

00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:17.710
"all" in the sense of "everyone
and everything";

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:23.899
"all" conveying a kind of
apocalyptic, epochal event.

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:29.146
That wonderful pileup of stress
in that line,

00:15:29.146 --> 00:15:32.604
"all changed,
changed utterly:

00:15:32.604 --> 00:15:37.379
/ a terrible beauty is born";
another two,

00:15:37.379 --> 00:15:40.039
two strong three-beat lines in
a row;

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:42.429
they become a kind of,
well what?

00:15:42.429 --> 00:15:51.041
A bell ringing in the poem,
pealing and announcing the

00:15:51.041 --> 00:15:58.840
coming of the birth of a new and
terrible age.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.799
How can something be changed
utterly?

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:08.610
How can something be changed
utterly?

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:14.919
Doesn't that mean "destroyed,"
to be entirely changed?

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:21.628
Yeats is talking about an event
that has brought forth

00:16:21.628 --> 00:16:28.464
destruction, destruction of the
world before the Easter

00:16:28.464 --> 00:16:32.400
Uprising.
And Easter is an important

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.779
resonance here,
obviously.

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:40.412
Easter, another moment of death
and transfiguration,

00:16:40.412 --> 00:16:45.834
transformation.
Here, this destruction brings

00:16:45.834 --> 00:16:51.579
forth a new order,
a new form of life that Yeats

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:54.879
calls "terrible beauty."
 

00:16:54.879 --> 00:17:01.026
This may be the most memorable
sentence in modern poetry:

00:17:01.026 --> 00:17:04.319
"a terrible beauty is born".
 

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:10.703
I said that Yeats looks on the
modern with a sense of both

00:17:10.703 --> 00:17:16.079
horror and a fascination,
a compulsion almost.

00:17:16.079 --> 00:17:23.170
Well, it's a "terrible beauty"
he sees that draws him in this

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.174
way.
He sees, specifically,

00:17:26.174 --> 00:17:31.390
the passion of the
revolutionary's act and he finds

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:36.112
it beautiful.
Yeats aestheticizes their

00:17:36.112 --> 00:17:38.309
political action.
 

00:17:38.309 --> 00:17:43.817
He finds beauty in it,
it seems even or especially

00:17:43.817 --> 00:17:51.539
because it is terror-filled,
when the change that it enacts

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:59.370
is utter, which is to say,
a change that means blood.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.930
 
 

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:09.620
To find bloody events
beautiful, what do you think

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:14.315
about that?
How do you describe the

00:18:14.315 --> 00:18:20.269
politics, if you like,
of such a position?

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:27.549
Well, how does Yeats stand in
relation to the events he's

00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:32.769
describing?
"Easter, 1916" equivocates.

00:18:32.769 --> 00:18:37.233
Like that phrase,
"a terrible beauty," the poem

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:42.569
is full of contradictions,
of contradictory feelings.

00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:45.849
It takes the side of the
nationalists.

00:18:45.849 --> 00:18:49.258
It also makes the
anti-nationalist,

00:18:49.258 --> 00:18:53.970
the English or pro-English or
unionist, case.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.140
It sees the dead as heroic
martyrs.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:10.586
It also sees them as
ideologues, as stony-hearted

00:19:10.586 --> 00:19:16.750
political activists.
 

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:22.490
It sees the dead as lovers, too.
 

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.700
It sees them as dreamers.
 

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:31.516
Yeats looks at them with pity,
with admiration,

00:19:31.516 --> 00:19:37.950
with scorn.
He speaks of them as a mother

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.750
would of her children.
 

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:47.096
All of these attitudes and
others, too, are held in

00:19:47.096 --> 00:19:49.769
suspension in the poem.
 

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:56.202
And you can hear them together,
Yeats moving from one to

00:19:56.202 --> 00:20:00.529
another with,
oh, incredible speed and

00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:05.910
agility in that final strophe of
the poem,

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.730
on the next page.
 

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.500
 
 

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:17.415
Listen to how quickly Yeats
modulates from one feeling,

00:20:17.415 --> 00:20:22.672
one image, to another in these
really very short,

00:20:22.672 --> 00:20:25.740
quick, three-beat lines.
 

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:32.620
Too long a sacrifice
Can make a stone of the heart.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:35.830
O when may it suffice?
 

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:42.770
That is heaven's part, our part
To murmur name upon name,

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:47.310
As a mother names her child
When sleep at last has come

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.480
On limbs that had run wild.
 

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.330
What is it but nightfall?
 

00:20:53.330 --> 00:21:02.290
No, no, not night but death;
Was it needless death after all?

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:06.770
For England may keep faith
For all that is done and said.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.880
We know their dream;
enough

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.970
To know they dreamed and are
dead;

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:17.280
And what if excess of love
Bewildered them till they died?

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.640
I write it out in a verse--
MacDonagh and MacBride

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:25.570
And Connolly and Pearse
Now and in time to be,

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:29.520
Wherever green is worn,
Are changed, changed utterly:

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.740
A terrible beauty is born.
 

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.039
 
 

00:21:36.039 --> 00:21:41.869
This is really moving poetry,
remarkably so.

00:21:41.869 --> 00:21:47.460
And that may be the most
important fact about it.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:54.228
When Yeats aestheticizes the
political, he makes it moving,

00:21:54.228 --> 00:22:01.229
moving in the literal sense of,
I think, emotionally engaging

00:22:01.229 --> 00:22:05.912
and cathartic.
He specifically converts the

00:22:05.912 --> 00:22:11.473
political into tragic action;
tragic action with which as

00:22:11.473 --> 00:22:16.750
spectators, the poet and the
reader -- ourselves,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:23.039
are meant to be passionately
and imaginatively engaged,

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:27.000
which is also to say
implicated.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.972
Through Yeats's poem,
Easter, 1916 goes on happening,

00:22:33.972 --> 00:22:39.470
happening in a sense in and
even to us.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:46.333
The poem makes us see the
political as a space of passion

00:22:46.333 --> 00:22:50.500
and of contradictions,
like art.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:55.479
And it requires us to
understand history not in moral

00:22:55.479 --> 00:23:00.842
terms, such as "good" and
"evil," but rather in aesthetic

00:23:00.842 --> 00:23:04.632
terms.
"Pity" and "terror," these

00:23:04.632 --> 00:23:09.642
become crucial terms,
the terms that Aristotle,

00:23:09.642 --> 00:23:14.980
in his Poetics,
used to define tragedy.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:19.624
When the bombs went off in
London last year,

00:23:19.624 --> 00:23:26.319
I thought about Yeats and what
he might have thought or written

00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:30.424
about this.
As I said last time when I

00:23:30.424 --> 00:23:36.061
showed you that letter to Pound,
Yeats's London apartment is

00:23:36.061 --> 00:23:41.507
essentially across the street
from where the number 30 bus

00:23:41.507 --> 00:23:44.749
blew up.
And interestingly,

00:23:44.749 --> 00:23:51.637
strangely, make of it what you
will, the man who detonated that

00:23:51.637 --> 00:23:57.747
bomb, as I understand it,
had studied Yeats at school in

00:23:57.747 --> 00:24:03.294
Leeds.
There's a way in which Yeats's

00:24:03.294 --> 00:24:11.655
poetry of this period goes on
resonating in the world we're

00:24:11.655 --> 00:24:15.808
living in.
Yeats's sense of his own

00:24:15.808 --> 00:24:20.651
implication in history,
well, it's something that we

00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:25.562
see in the intensive,
stylistic transformations that

00:24:25.562 --> 00:24:27.579
his writing undergoes.
 

00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:31.199
Part of the resonance and power
of that famous refrain,

00:24:31.199 --> 00:24:35.062
"a terrible beauty is born,"
is that this beauty is being

00:24:35.062 --> 00:24:38.369
born not only in the world but
in Yeats's poetry.

00:24:38.369 --> 00:24:44.512
Something remarkable is
happening to the poet and to his

00:24:44.512 --> 00:24:47.640
language at the same time.
 

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.322
Yeats is saying even simply on
one level, "I will write

00:24:52.322 --> 00:24:55.269
differently henceforth,
I must."

00:24:55.269 --> 00:25:00.996
Yeats's stylistic changes in
this way are coordinated with,

00:25:00.996 --> 00:25:05.835
respond to the historical
changes he witnesses and

00:25:05.835 --> 00:25:09.443
participates in;
in particular,

00:25:09.443 --> 00:25:14.229
coordinated with the violent
emergence of,

00:25:14.229 --> 00:25:18.690
through civil war,
of the Irish State,

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:24.509
for which Yeats would serve as
a senator in the 1920s.

00:25:24.509 --> 00:25:31.098
Yeats in this period makes and
remakes his work out of passion,

00:25:31.098 --> 00:25:37.291
a sort of, as he images it,
tumult in the breast,

00:25:37.291 --> 00:25:44.994
a tumult from which new modes
of poetry, new modes of

00:25:44.994 --> 00:25:50.180
self-knowledge emerge for Yeats.
 

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:54.559
Yeats's poetry is full of
images of birth,

00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:59.900
and he tends to represent birth
as an explosion,

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:05.380
a bursting forth,
a bursting forth of energy or

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:11.099
presence in some sense that
can't be contained or

00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:15.150
constrained in existing forms.
 

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:20.977
I'll say more about this next
time with reference to Yeats's

00:26:20.977 --> 00:26:25.729
late poetry.
What I want to stress now is

00:26:25.729 --> 00:26:32.950
that Yeats sees passion at work
in the same way in history.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:40.215
Powerful super human forces
emerge from, or invade,

00:26:40.215 --> 00:26:44.720
human actors and change them.
 

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.689
One consequence of this view is
that for Yeats history starts to

00:26:50.689 --> 00:26:56.898
look like a poem,
or it starts to conform to laws

00:26:56.898 --> 00:27:03.725
of poetic imagination or of
tragedy, if you like,

00:27:03.725 --> 00:27:08.201
of myth.
In the Easter Rising,

00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:15.135
Pearse and the others for Yeats
invoke -- as they,

00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:22.468
the revolutionaries themselves,
deliberately and rhetorically

00:27:22.468 --> 00:27:25.809
did -- invoke ancient Irish
heroes.

00:27:25.809 --> 00:27:32.770
Pearse is seen as,
in Yeats's poetry and in

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:37.079
popular lore,
as Cuchulain,

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:45.200
as a kind of avatar of the
mythic Irish hero.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:51.191
At the same time,
as the superhuman enters these

00:27:51.191 --> 00:27:55.779
historical characters in this
way,

00:27:55.779 --> 00:28:01.387
there is also,
well, an energy that you would

00:28:01.387 --> 00:28:05.720
have to call sub-human,
bestial,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.690
that does as well.
 

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:14.888
In his late poem,
"The Statues," which you don't

00:28:14.888 --> 00:28:21.219
have, Yeats says,
"When Pearse summoned Cuchulain

00:28:21.219 --> 00:28:26.991
to his side,
/ what stalked through the post

00:28:26.991 --> 00:28:32.777
office," as if the
revolutionaries' action brought

00:28:32.777 --> 00:28:40.099
forth at once the presence of a
legendary hero and a beast that

00:28:40.099 --> 00:28:47.539
might be stalking through his
embodiment and his presence.

00:28:47.539 --> 00:28:53.109
Yeats saw history in symbolic
and mystical terms.

00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:56.114
This is a poet who,
with his wife,

00:28:56.114 --> 00:29:01.029
practiced automatic writing,
who believed that the dead

00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:03.670
spoke through the living.
 

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.601
This occult Yeats is a
genuinely and wonderfully

00:29:08.601 --> 00:29:13.307
strange thinker.
He elaborated a systematic

00:29:13.307 --> 00:29:16.450
account of mind and history.
 

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.954
As I said last time,
talking about "The Song of the

00:29:19.954 --> 00:29:22.828
Wandering Aengus",
and Yeats's interest in

00:29:22.828 --> 00:29:25.333
alchemy,
which was developed,

00:29:25.333 --> 00:29:28.992
it isn't, in fact,
necessary for you to grasp

00:29:28.992 --> 00:29:33.525
Yeats's system,
which you'd have to go to his

00:29:33.525 --> 00:29:38.130
book called A Vision to
begin to do.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:44.404
It isn't necessary for you to
grasp his occultism in order to

00:29:44.404 --> 00:29:46.809
read his poetry well.
 

00:29:46.809 --> 00:29:51.618
Yeats said that the voices that
he communicated with on the

00:29:51.618 --> 00:29:55.350
other side gave him "metaphors
for poetry."

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:57.799
This is what they deliver him.
 

00:29:57.799 --> 00:30:00.701
They also gave him,
as he put it,

00:30:00.701 --> 00:30:04.420
"stylistic arrangements of
experience."

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:10.549
The occult gives Yeats
aesthetic forms for

00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:19.369
understanding individual
psychology and historical event.

00:30:19.369 --> 00:30:25.159
This is, I think,
how we need to understand the

00:30:25.159 --> 00:30:31.829
various occult symbols in
another great poem from this

00:30:31.829 --> 00:30:36.699
phase in his career,
a little bit further on,

00:30:36.699 --> 00:30:39.320
"The Second Coming," on page
111.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:57.589
 
 

00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:00.700
Turning and turning in
the widening gyre

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.510
The falcon cannot hear the
falconer;

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:07.609
Things fall apart;
the centre cannot hold;

00:31:07.609 --> 00:31:11.049
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the
world,

00:31:11.049 --> 00:31:14.640
The blood-dimmed tide is
loosed, and everywhere

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.799
The ceremony of innocence is
drowned;

00:31:17.799 --> 00:31:21.710
The best lack all conviction,
while the worst

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:24.840
Are full of passionate
intensity.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.000
 
 

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.039
Surely some revelation is at
hand;

00:31:32.039 --> 00:31:36.090
Surely the Second Coming is at
hand.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.680
The Second Coming!
 

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.243
Hardly are those words out
When a vast image out of

00:31:42.243 --> 00:31:45.685
Spiritus Mundi
Troubles my sight:

00:31:45.685 --> 00:31:49.160
somewhere in sands of the
desert

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.789
A shape with lion body and the
head of a man,

00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:56.769
A gaze blank and pitiless as
the sun,

00:31:56.769 --> 00:32:02.130
Is moving its slow thighs,
while all about it

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.650
Reel shadows of the indignant
desert birds.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:11.500
The darkness drops again;
but now I know

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:14.529
That twenty centuries of stony
sleep

00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:18.410
Were vexed to nightmare by a
rocking cradle,

00:32:18.410 --> 00:32:23.079
And what rough beast,
its hour come round at last,

00:32:23.079 --> 00:32:28.040
Slouches towards Bethlehem to
be born?

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:31.240
Another poem of birth.
 

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:36.357
Notice how very casual Yeats is
in that second strophe,

00:32:36.357 --> 00:32:41.569
how self-consciously fantastic
and speculative he is.

00:32:41.569 --> 00:32:45.659
He doesn't insist that the
Apocalypse is at hand,

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:48.299
only that some revelation is.
 

00:32:48.299 --> 00:32:52.332
In fact, this poem's power
lies, I think,

00:32:52.332 --> 00:32:58.581
in its--not only its inability
but its unwillingness to specify

00:32:58.581 --> 00:33:02.109
the content of that revelation.
 

00:33:02.109 --> 00:33:09.081
Yeasts suggests that we think
of this historical moment as the

00:33:09.081 --> 00:33:13.726
Second Coming.
But this is not the return of

00:33:13.726 --> 00:33:17.319
Jesus that Christianity
prophesizes.

00:33:17.319 --> 00:33:21.055
Yeats sees the Second Coming as
an image, as a myth,

00:33:21.055 --> 00:33:24.791
an idea, a metaphor,
a certain stylistic arrangement

00:33:24.791 --> 00:33:28.809
of experience.
It comes out of what he calls

00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:32.440
Spiritus Mundi,
a semi-technical term;

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.588
Yeats's name for something like
the collective unconscious of

00:33:36.588 --> 00:33:40.115
all peoples, a kind of
repertoire of archetypes from

00:33:40.115 --> 00:33:44.610
which the symbols that we use to
understand the world derive.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:49.430
 
 

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:54.162
This is really,
I think, a radical if not

00:33:54.162 --> 00:34:01.380
heretical idea for the national
poet of a Christian people.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.578
Yeats is saying that
Christianity is only one

00:34:04.578 --> 00:34:06.760
symbolic order among others.
 

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.889
It has a history.
 

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:13.409
It is now passing away as it
once came into being.

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:18.265
He is also saying that the
birth of Christ in Bethlehem was

00:34:18.265 --> 00:34:21.530
a nightmare for the world it
altered,

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:27.052
the world that it changed
utterly -- a change that Yeats

00:34:27.052 --> 00:34:32.082
sees as the end now of the
Christian Era and not its

00:34:32.082 --> 00:34:34.967
fulfillment.
There is in there,

00:34:34.967 --> 00:34:39.396
too, the disturbing suggestion
that Christ himself was a rough

00:34:39.396 --> 00:34:42.224
beast.
Yeats develops this idea or

00:34:42.224 --> 00:34:46.735
develops another version of it
in a somewhat earlier poem

00:34:46.735 --> 00:34:50.440
that's interesting in relation
to this one.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:56.650
And let's turn back and look at
it, on page 103.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.450
That's "The Magi";
 

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:02.190
 
 

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:06.889
again, a visionary poem where
Yeats is saying,

00:35:06.889 --> 00:35:10.440
"I see, I see in my mind's
eye."

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:14.989
The action of the poem takes
place in Yeats's imagination.

00:35:14.989 --> 00:35:19.630
Now as at all times I can
see in the mind's eye,

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.938
In their stiff,
painted clothes,

00:35:22.938 --> 00:35:27.897
the pale unsatisfied ones
Appear and disappear in the

00:35:27.897 --> 00:35:31.824
blue depth of the sky
With all their ancient faces

00:35:31.824 --> 00:35:36.290
like rain-beaten stones,
And all their helms of silver

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:40.995
hovering side by side,
And all their eyes still fixed,

00:35:40.995 --> 00:35:46.455
hoping to find once more
Being by Calvary's turbulence

00:35:46.455 --> 00:35:52.200
unsatisfied,
The uncontrollable mystery on

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.938
the bestial floor.
The Magi here are,

00:35:57.938 --> 00:36:02.809
again, an image,
a kind of visionary symbol,

00:36:02.809 --> 00:36:09.039
an image available "in the
mind's eye" at all times.

00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:14.486
They are unsatisfied by
"Calvary's turbulence" --

00:36:14.486 --> 00:36:19.598
"Calvary's turbulence," a
remarkable phrase --

00:36:19.598 --> 00:36:26.156
unsatisfied by the scene of
Christian martyrdom because they

00:36:26.156 --> 00:36:32.491
recognize that history is
cyclical and that the cycle that

00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:38.715
they saw come into being can
only be completed by another

00:36:38.715 --> 00:36:43.973
such birth,
not by Christ's death and

00:36:43.973 --> 00:36:49.956
resurrection.
Notice here how Yeats images

00:36:49.956 --> 00:36:56.010
what is at the core of Christ's
birth.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:04.706
It is an uncontrollable mystery
"on the bestial floor":

00:37:04.706 --> 00:37:09.054
on the floor,
on the bottom,

00:37:09.054 --> 00:37:15.980
on the ground,
where the animals dwell.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.715
The Second Coming,
it seems, is as Yeats imagines

00:37:20.715 --> 00:37:25.449
it a kind of similarly
uncontrollable mystery,

00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:30.859
and the energy,
the new presence that it

00:37:30.859 --> 00:37:36.130
releases into the world,
is bestial,

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:40.130
is that of a beast.
 

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:48.278
The divine enters the human in
these poems of Yeats's through

00:37:48.278 --> 00:37:54.813
the bestial.
It's a powerful and disturbing

00:37:54.813 --> 00:38:02.010
idea.
There's another very powerful

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:12.389
and disturbing poem that
literalizes this idea,

00:38:12.389 --> 00:38:17.662
and that is "Leda and the
Swan," on page 118:

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:23.893
a poem that is a sonnet,
though it doesn't quite look

00:38:23.893 --> 00:38:32.664
like it at first,
a mythological poem that seeks

00:38:32.664 --> 00:38:45.590
to give a mythological image to
or for the kinds of epochal and

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:58.099
apocalyptic historical change
that Yeats is living through in

00:38:58.099 --> 00:39:03.519
the 1920s in Ireland.
 

00:39:03.519 --> 00:39:09.183
In certain ways,
it's a beautiful poem and a

00:39:09.183 --> 00:39:13.530
grotesque one at the same time.
 

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:20.179
A sudden blow:
the great wings beating still

00:39:20.179 --> 00:39:24.480
Above the staggering girl,
her thighs caressed

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.260
By the dark webs,
her nape caught in his bill,

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:34.840
He holds her helpless breast
upon his breast.

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:39.900
How can those terrified vague
fingers push

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:44.719
The feathered glory from her
loosening thighs?

00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:48.940
And how can body,
laid in that white rush,

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.250
But feel the strange heart
beating where it lies?

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:57.059
A shudder in the loins
engenders there

00:39:57.059 --> 00:40:00.520
The broken wall,
the burning roof and tower

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.210
And Agamemnon dead.
 

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:11.409
Being so caught up,
So mastered by the brute blood

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:16.594
of the air,
Did she put on his knowledge

00:40:16.594 --> 00:40:20.322
with his power
Before the indifferent beak

00:40:20.322 --> 00:40:21.990
could let her drop?
 

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:25.860
 
 

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:34.700
History, what makes history
happen, is imaged here in the

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:44.014
form of the rape of the human by
the divine in the form of a

00:40:44.014 --> 00:40:48.750
beast, the form of a swan.
 

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:54.839
The myth that Yeats takes up is
of Zeus's rape of the maiden,

00:40:54.839 --> 00:40:58.289
Leda, whom he attacks as a
swan.

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:03.733
The offspring that the rape
engenders includes Helen,

00:41:03.733 --> 00:41:09.909
the "terrible beauty" for whom
the Trojan War was fought;

00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:15.970
also Clytemnestra,
the wife of the Greek lord

00:41:15.970 --> 00:41:24.510
Agamemnon whom Clytemnestra
murders on his return from Troy.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:32.447
Those future events are
glimpsed in the sestet of this

00:41:32.447 --> 00:41:37.090
poem, in the final six lines.
 

00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:43.165
They are, in a sense,
compressed and imaged and

00:41:43.165 --> 00:41:47.260
contained in the rape itself.
 

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:52.909
There's a kind of radical
foreshortening of temporal

00:41:52.909 --> 00:41:59.444
experience at what Yeats images
as the orgasmic union of the

00:41:59.444 --> 00:42:06.422
divine and human -- "a shudder
in the loins" -- bringing about

00:42:06.422 --> 00:42:11.774
the sack of Troy,
the murder of the king,

00:42:11.774 --> 00:42:17.140
all that future contained in
this generative,

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:24.579
ambiguous violence in the
present that the poem describes.

00:42:24.579 --> 00:42:30.448
In effect, in that middle part
of the poem, Yeats collapses

00:42:30.448 --> 00:42:35.570
creation and destruction,
suggesting that the same

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:40.449
bestial energy flows through
both of these acts.

00:42:40.449 --> 00:42:47.280
Here, divine force reduces to
brute power in somewhat the same

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:53.440
way as it does in "The Magi" and
"The Second Coming."

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.818
One result of this is Yeats's
-- and this is interesting --

00:42:57.818 --> 00:43:00.300
his lack of interest in the god.
 

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:05.610
This isn't a poem about Zeus;
it's not a poem about the swan.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:09.895
He doesn't name the swan,
just as he doesn't name the

00:43:09.895 --> 00:43:13.110
"rough beast" in "The Second
Coming."

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:18.409
What the swan thinks or feels
or intends doesn't matter.

00:43:18.409 --> 00:43:22.981
The swan is really only a
force, and Yeats's concern is

00:43:22.981 --> 00:43:27.130
rather with the human experience
of that force,

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:31.610
which is, again,
another manifestation of

00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.849
"terrible beauty."
 

00:43:33.849 --> 00:43:41.055
Yeats explores that experience,
which is an experience of

00:43:41.055 --> 00:43:48.907
suffering here and of violation,
through a series of rhetorical

00:43:48.907 --> 00:43:55.400
questions, which are a crucial
poetic device for Yeats.

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:59.530
Yeats is a poet who asks
questions.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:01.886
Questions, well,
they're different,

00:44:01.886 --> 00:44:05.489
even rhetorical questions are
different, aren't they,

00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:07.429
from statements of fact.
 

00:44:07.429 --> 00:44:12.846
They're more like propositions,
like speculations,

00:44:12.846 --> 00:44:18.925
that we're asked to test
through empathic identification

00:44:18.925 --> 00:44:21.546
with,
in this case,

00:44:21.546 --> 00:44:24.800
the poem's subject,
Leda.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:30.486
This is what the form of the
question invites,

00:44:30.486 --> 00:44:34.309
I think.
In "Easter, 1916" I talked

00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:39.528
about Yeats's partial,
complicated identification with

00:44:39.528 --> 00:44:43.269
the suffering martyrs of that
poem.

00:44:43.269 --> 00:44:48.380
Well, that identification here
is re-imagined and we're invited

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.440
into it, too,
troublingly,

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.921
I think.
The frightening experience that

00:44:54.921 --> 00:45:01.116
Yeats evokes here is the
imposition of the divine on the

00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:04.793
human.
"Helpless breast upon...

00:45:04.793 --> 00:45:08.789
breast": that's a wonderful
phrase.

00:45:08.789 --> 00:45:14.441
The repetition of "breast"
links them, makes us see them

00:45:14.441 --> 00:45:19.579
together, side by side,
one on top of the other.

00:45:19.579 --> 00:45:22.475
It even, I think,
identifies the divine and the

00:45:22.475 --> 00:45:24.929
human, makes them hard to tell
apart;

00:45:24.929 --> 00:45:30.278
binds them, even while we are
being confronted with their

00:45:30.278 --> 00:45:34.395
difference.
Leda feels the beating of the

00:45:34.395 --> 00:45:38.659
swan's heart,
and that heart is "strange" to

00:45:38.659 --> 00:45:42.130
her, that simple,
powerful word.

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:47.913
The poem's great final question
concerns that perception:

00:45:47.913 --> 00:45:52.869
"Did she put on his knowledge
with his power"?

00:45:52.869 --> 00:46:00.820
Did she know the heart she felt
or could she only feel it?

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:05.299
What difference would it make
between those two things,

00:46:05.299 --> 00:46:09.530
between knowing that heart and
merely feeling it?

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:13.432
It's the difference between
knowing history --

00:46:13.432 --> 00:46:17.760
understanding its patterns and
motivating forces,

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.377
causes, intentions -- and
merely feeling it,

00:46:22.377 --> 00:46:27.415
merely suffering it,
serving as its instrument or

00:46:27.415 --> 00:46:31.990
vessel,
an object to be dropped when

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:34.800
it's no longer useful.
 

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.097
To know history,
to be able to put on the god's

00:46:38.097 --> 00:46:41.753
knowledge with his power,
would be to have access to

00:46:41.753 --> 00:46:46.379
history's meaning,
and therefore to be more than

00:46:46.379 --> 00:46:51.636
merely subject to it,
subject to its capricious and

00:46:51.636 --> 00:46:53.739
violating forces.
 

00:46:53.739 --> 00:46:58.300
But Yeats doesn't answer the
question, does he?

00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:04.258
Well, why not?
Probably because there isn't an

00:47:04.258 --> 00:47:07.976
answer.
The further implication is,

00:47:07.976 --> 00:47:14.546
I think, that whether or not we
can have access to historical

00:47:14.546 --> 00:47:20.638
knowledge,
the only path to such knowledge

00:47:20.638 --> 00:47:28.619
is through submission to its
bestial or brute power,

00:47:28.619 --> 00:47:33.110
which is a kind of shattering
experience in this poem.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:39.943
Well, on Monday we'll look at
some of the figures in Yeats's

00:47:39.943 --> 00:47:47.125
late poems, who represent a kind
of knowledge to be had through

00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:53.380
an experience of violation or of
shattering power,

00:47:53.380 --> 00:48:02.055
characters such as the mad old
men or Crazy Jane in Yeats's

00:48:02.055 --> 00:48:04.000
late poems.

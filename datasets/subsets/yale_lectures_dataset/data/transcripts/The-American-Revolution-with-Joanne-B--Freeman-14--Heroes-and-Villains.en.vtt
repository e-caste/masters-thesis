00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.280
So we are now post midterm.
 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.060
We've gotten past the midterm,
which is excellent.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.370
And what I want--the lecture
I'm going to give today is

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.252
actually titled "Heroes and
Villains,"

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:18.501
and I'm going to explain what
that means in just a few

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:19.360
minutes.
 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.724
I'm going to segue,
so I'm just touching on one or

00:00:21.724 --> 00:00:24.572
two of the things that I talked
about at the end of the last

00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:27.207
lecture,
segueing right in to this

00:00:27.207 --> 00:00:27.930
lecture.
 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.596
And hopefully you remember that
right before the midterm,

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:35.198
the last lecture I gave,
I was talking about the process

00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:36.770
of organizing a war.
 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.310
And I talked about some of the
problems that the Continental

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.490
Congress had in dealing with the
Continental Army,

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.057
and I at least referred to some
of the ways in which these

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:52.545
problems hinted at larger
problems with unity between the

00:00:52.545 --> 00:00:55.270
newly created American states.
 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.050
So for example,
I talked about regionalism,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.131
and I talked about some of the
ways in which regionalism

00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:04.438
complicated the task of
organizing the Continental Army,

00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:07.620
for example things like
considering how to balance

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.995
positions of military command
between Northerners and

00:01:10.995 --> 00:01:13.985
Southerners,
or getting units from one

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:18.436
region of the country to deal
with units from another region

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:21.396
of the country,
or getting soldiers from

00:01:21.396 --> 00:01:25.149
different regions as well as
individual soldiers to agree to

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.330
sacrifice for the common good
throughout the entire

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.019
confederation of states instead
of thinking about their own

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:35.200
state or their own locality
above all else.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.810
And I also talked about a
related problem,

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.400
and I called that the problem
of localism,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.920
and I talked about how a
localized view of the world,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.819
or certainly a localized view
of the new states,

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.769
worked against centralized
control.

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:56.191
So localities of all sorts had
difficulty surrendering local

00:01:56.191 --> 00:02:00.239
control to some kind of a
central organization like the

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:03.847
Continental Congress,
which obviously had to equip

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:06.286
the army,
and thus that raised all kinds

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:08.490
of other complications and
problems.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.447
Each state wanted to maintain
control, for example,

00:02:11.447 --> 00:02:12.688
of its own militia.
 

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:16.604
And then finally,
at the very end of the lecture

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:21.352
I mentioned that many people who
would end up being strong

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:25.348
nationalists in the 1780s and in
the 1790s--

00:02:25.348 --> 00:02:28.650
people who were going to end up
being at the forefront of the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.729
movement to strengthen the
Articles of Confederation--

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.724
many of these people gained
their political beliefs and the

00:02:35.724 --> 00:02:40.065
need for some kind of a stronger
centralized national government

00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:43.508
from their experiences during
the Revolution,

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:46.916
from their experiences with
what often felt like what

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:50.127
Alexander Hamilton called an
imbecilic centralized

00:02:50.127 --> 00:02:51.110
government.
 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.372
That was his word that he
applied to the Continental

00:02:53.372 --> 00:02:54.878
Congress, "imbecilic."
 

00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:57.179
So basically,
looking at the army and then

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.725
looking at Congress,
we see regionalism and localism

00:03:00.725 --> 00:03:05.020
both working against centralized
control and coordination.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.876
We see a lack of precedent for
centralized governance of this

00:03:09.876 --> 00:03:12.788
kind, which led to some
confusion.

00:03:12.788 --> 00:03:16.724
And certainly that made it
possible for any important

00:03:16.724 --> 00:03:20.659
decision that had to do with
centralized power having

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.050
seemingly enough importance to
make it earth-shaking--

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.133
and thus seemingly trivial
things ended up seeming to have

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:29.110
huge importance because they
might set a precedent,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.038
again all of this working
against effectiveness.

00:03:33.038 --> 00:03:36.901
So all of these things
complicated the creation not

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:40.498
just of a Continental Army,
but also of first,

00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:43.770
colonial unity,
and then American unity and--

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.930
as we're going to see in weeks
to come--

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.128
ultimately constitutional unity.
 

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:52.788
And we're going to see this
sort of concern and confusion

00:03:52.788 --> 00:03:56.252
and these complications of
centralized power coming up

00:03:56.252 --> 00:04:00.330
again and again this semester,
particularly at the beginning

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.483
of April when we begin to talk
about the Articles of

00:04:03.483 --> 00:04:07.252
Confederation and people really
debating about what's the best

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:10.960
form of government for these new
states to unite under.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.020
So these ideas--things like
regionalism and things like

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.480
localism and how they
complicated the army,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.321
and also centralized
power--those things are actually

00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:23.778
going to come up in today's
lecture which,

00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:26.060
as I said, I titled
"Heroes and Villains."

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.920
And what I'm really going to be
doing in today's lecture--It's a

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.689
different kind of lecture from
ones that I've given before.

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.730
Happily for you,
it's a lecture that will

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.641
probably require you to take
less notes than you typically

00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:40.476
take in lecture for this course,
because what I'm going to do is

00:04:40.476 --> 00:04:44.309
kind of use a case study to look
up close at just a handful of

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:48.202
people and a series of events as
a way of exploring some of the

00:04:48.202 --> 00:04:51.470
ideas that we've been talking
about generally--

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.519
ideas about the Congress,
ideas about the army,

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:59.110
and how they actually played
out in a few individual lives.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.480
So what we're going to see in
the course of today's lecture,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.800
which in a way is one big
story, is some of the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.204
complications inherent in how
the Continental Congress handled

00:05:10.204 --> 00:05:12.009
the Continental Army.
 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:14.439
We're going to see a very
specific example of that.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.507
We're going to see regionalism
making trouble in the

00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:18.649
Continental Army.
 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:22.678
We're going to see how serving
in the army affected--in the

00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:26.708
case of today's lecture--several
people's lives in a really

00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:27.750
direct way.
 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.480
And then on a broader scale,
by looking at this one story--

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.898
which is intertwined with the
actions of the Continental Army

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:38.519
and what it meant to this
handful of lives--

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:42.379
we're also going to see some
broader truths about American

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:43.870
society at the time.
 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.144
So we're going to see for
example how the army was an

00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:50.726
outlet for personal ambition,
how people maybe tried to use

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:53.589
service in the army as a way to
promote themselves,

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:55.269
something that I've mentioned
before.

00:05:55.269 --> 00:05:59.190
We're going to see how living
at a time of war opened paths

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.639
for people that might not
otherwise have existed.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.526
We're going to see the
sometimes slippery status of

00:06:06.526 --> 00:06:11.358
women during a time of war,
and we're going to see how many

00:06:11.358 --> 00:06:16.117
Americans still revered some
British cultural ideals even in

00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:19.019
the midst of war against
Britain.

00:06:19.019 --> 00:06:21.319
And the story that I'm going to
use today,

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.817
the sort of case study that's
going to help us delve into all

00:06:23.817 --> 00:06:26.153
of these things,
is the story of Benedict

00:06:26.153 --> 00:06:29.889
Arnold, Peggy Shippen Arnold,
and John Andre.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:32.040
All of these people--All three
of these people,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.595
in one way or another,
attempted to use the war and

00:06:35.595 --> 00:06:38.519
its armies to make,
or I guess maybe more

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:42.081
accurately to unmake,
themselves and their

00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:43.430
reputations.
 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.314
In one way or another,
all of them were trying to

00:06:46.314 --> 00:06:49.740
better themselves through the
opportunities of warfare.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.810
Now before we launch into that
case study,

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.298
I just want to talk for a
moment about why warfare created

00:06:57.298 --> 00:07:01.392
such opportunities for
potentially raising a person's

00:07:01.392 --> 00:07:04.940
social status,
and thus why some people were

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.639
actually eager for war.
 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:10.800
Now in some of the early
lectures for this course,

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.723
I discussed social status in
the colonies and I talked a

00:07:14.723 --> 00:07:18.149
little bit about how society in
the colonies,

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:22.439
while it certainly did have an
elite sort of gentlemanly rank

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.413
of people,
that overall American society

00:07:25.413 --> 00:07:28.939
tended to be more middling than
English society,

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.660
which did have an entrenched
aristocratic class.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.509
In America, if you wanted to
have gentlemanly status--

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:39.370
and in a sense it was more
difficult to be born into it in

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:41.980
the way that you could have in a
European nation--

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:45.569
there were actually a limited
number of pathways that were

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:48.529
open to you to achieve that kind
of a status.

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:52.129
Basically, there were a handful
of professions that were assumed

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:54.129
in this period to be
gentlemanly.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:58.430
These included medicine,
the law, the ministry,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.035
the church, perhaps being a
merchant that was wealthy enough

00:08:02.035 --> 00:08:05.028
that you didn't seem to be
grubbing for money--

00:08:05.028 --> 00:08:08.151
that you seemed to be living
happily off of your vast sums of

00:08:08.151 --> 00:08:10.189
money,
maybe someone who owned a

00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:15.475
really sizable plantation,
or serving as an officer in an

00:08:15.475 --> 00:08:16.180
army.
 

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.908
And I was sort of unsure what
to do with college professors,

00:08:19.908 --> 00:08:21.680
near and dear to my heart.
 

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.199
I decided I would not
officially put them on the list,

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:26.312
although many college
professors in this period would

00:08:26.312 --> 00:08:28.500
have been in the clergy,
certainly some of them would

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.290
have been lawyers,
so I think they would have

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.080
generally fallen into the
gentlemanly ranks,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.067
but I'm being unbiased here so
I'm leaving college professors

00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:37.529
over here somewhere.
 

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:37.726
Okay.
 

00:08:37.726 --> 00:08:39.779
So of all of those positions
that I've just named,

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:42.580
being a military officer,
serving as an officer during--

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.769
in an army but particularly
during a time of war,

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:49.480
offered the greatest chance for
instant glory,

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.629
instant status,
instant rank through bravery

00:08:52.629 --> 00:08:55.779
and displays of valor on the
battlefield.

00:08:55.779 --> 00:08:59.774
For the very ambitious or for
people who had a problematic

00:08:59.774 --> 00:09:02.649
social rank for one reason or
another,

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:06.111
a war could be a great
opportunity for you to improve

00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:10.285
your place in the world,
particularly in a place like

00:09:10.285 --> 00:09:11.048
America.
 

00:09:11.048 --> 00:09:15.389
And one extreme example of this
is actually Alexander Hamilton,

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:18.690
who was born illegitimate in
the West Indies--

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.980
and it's really clear from the
absolute first letter of his

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.307
that we know of,
which was written when he was

00:09:24.307 --> 00:09:27.595
fourteen years old,
that he absolutely thought that

00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:30.596
his only ticket off of the
island of St.

00:09:30.596 --> 00:09:34.058
Croix was through military
glory in a war.

00:09:34.058 --> 00:09:37.015
That was really the way that he
saw that he was going to make

00:09:37.015 --> 00:09:39.134
something of himself,
get himself off of St.

00:09:39.134 --> 00:09:41.402
Croix, earn a name,
get status, get reputation,

00:09:41.402 --> 00:09:44.259
and start the process of making
something of himself in the

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:44.950
world.
 

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.524
So as he says in this letter,
and it's written when he's

00:09:47.524 --> 00:09:49.679
fourteen, "my Ambition is
prevalent....

00:09:49.679 --> 00:09:51.879
I wish there was a War."
 

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:52.133
Okay.
 

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:53.297
[laughs]
As a historian,

00:09:53.297 --> 00:09:55.714
you're so happy--
again, I said this before--when

00:09:55.714 --> 00:09:58.567
your historical subjects say the
thing you want them to say that

00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:00.200
you can then quote forever
after.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.428
'Hi.
 

00:10:00.428 --> 00:10:03.759
I am ambitious and I want a war
so I can promote myself.'

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:06.620
Thank you, Alexander Hamilton,
very much.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:06.993
Okay.
 

00:10:06.993 --> 00:10:09.830
Now in a sense Hamilton was
extreme,

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:11.798
because he was very
underprivileged,

00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:16.080
he was extremely ambitious and
very determined,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.741
but in a sense his entire
generation of young men saw the

00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:23.740
Revolution as a chance for
glory,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.960
status, rank, self-promotion.
 

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.802
And I talked about a similar
idea last week when I mentioned

00:10:30.802 --> 00:10:34.451
that there were a number of
Europeans who came to America

00:10:34.451 --> 00:10:38.120
during the Revolution,
sometimes because they figured

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.990
that they could probably impress
Americans,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.346
or certainly impress the
Continental Congress with their

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:46.850
experience in formal European
warfare,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.451
and then they could get a
position as an officer easier

00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:52.437
than they might have been able
to obtain it or purchase it back

00:10:52.437 --> 00:10:54.315
home,
and--so that there were a

00:10:54.315 --> 00:10:57.720
number of Europeans coming to
this country for that purpose.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.519
And I mentioned at the time
that actually Hamilton,

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:02.629
trying to do something really
similar,

00:11:02.629 --> 00:11:05.725
said that watching these
Europeans come and get promoted

00:11:05.725 --> 00:11:08.708
by the Congress above his head
gave him what he called

00:11:08.708 --> 00:11:12.028
"pigmy-feelings,"
made him feel really puny,

00:11:12.028 --> 00:11:14.586
really small in comparison with
these sort of grand Europeans

00:11:14.586 --> 00:11:17.057
coming and sort of getting
everything that he wanted and he

00:11:17.057 --> 00:11:19.059
wasn't getting because he was
just a puny,

00:11:19.059 --> 00:11:20.590
little American.
 

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.956
So in a sense,
in a world where there were a

00:11:23.956 --> 00:11:28.028
limited number of pathways to
gentlemanly status,

00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:32.240
serving as an officer during a
time of war could be kind of an

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.764
escalator of rank,
offering the chance to get

00:11:35.764 --> 00:11:37.600
ahead at a rapid pace.
 

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.812
So being an officer in the
Continental Army could have

00:11:40.812 --> 00:11:44.572
seemed particularly attractive
to highly ambitious men who were

00:11:44.572 --> 00:11:47.178
looking for some kind of a big
chance,

00:11:47.178 --> 00:11:50.899
and Benedict Arnold was one of
those men.

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:54.143
Now I think when most Americans
think about the American

00:11:54.143 --> 00:11:57.621
Revolution--And I remember I
started out this course sort of

00:11:57.621 --> 00:11:59.509
talking about the same idea.
 

00:11:59.509 --> 00:12:02.678
I assumed that maybe people
know Washington led the army,

00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:05.399
that Paul Revere rode around on
a horse saying something about

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:07.525
the British,
that Jefferson had something to

00:12:07.525 --> 00:12:09.500
do with the Declaration of
Independence,

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.235
and I'll add to that list,
most people know Benedict

00:12:12.235 --> 00:12:13.470
Arnold was a traitor.
 

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.485
They don't know why,
they don't know how,

00:12:15.485 --> 00:12:18.206
but you assume the name
Benedict Arnold goes along with

00:12:18.206 --> 00:12:19.870
the word "traitor."
 

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.166
John Adams was pretty much
right on the money when he

00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:27.095
predicted how future generations
were going to see the American

00:12:27.095 --> 00:12:29.668
Revolution,
and it's right in line with

00:12:29.668 --> 00:12:30.710
what I just said.
 

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.952
And he actually wrote in 1790
to Benjamin Rush,

00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:37.902
"The History of our
Revolution will be one continued

00:12:37.902 --> 00:12:40.298
lie from one end to the other.
 

00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:43.558
The essence of the whole will
be that Dr. Franklin's

00:12:43.558 --> 00:12:46.883
electrical Rod smote the Earth
and out sprung General

00:12:46.883 --> 00:12:47.970
Washington.
 

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:51.081
[laughter]
That Franklin electrified him

00:12:51.081 --> 00:12:52.873
with his Rod--
[laughs]

00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:56.210
and henceforth these two
conducted all the Policy,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.590
Negotiations,
Legislatures and War."

00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:58.837
Okay.
 

00:12:58.837 --> 00:13:01.918
So Adams is actually probably
coming pretty close to reality.

00:13:01.918 --> 00:13:03.586
People are going to look back
and they're going to say,

00:13:03.586 --> 00:13:04.019
'Yeah, yeah.
 

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:05.429
Franklin, Washington,
and the war.

00:13:05.429 --> 00:13:06.850
That was the Revolution.'
 

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:08.809
Now I always--I knew that quote.
 

00:13:08.809 --> 00:13:09.870
I've known it for a long time.
 

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.849
I love that quote,
which is why I found a reason

00:13:11.849 --> 00:13:13.658
to sort of wind it into today's
lecture,

00:13:13.658 --> 00:13:15.480
but when I went back to look it
up today,

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.986
for the first time I actually
read the whole letter that it

00:13:17.986 --> 00:13:18.548
comes from.
 

00:13:18.548 --> 00:13:21.048
And I found another sentence
which I actually hadn't focused

00:13:21.048 --> 00:13:23.317
on before,
and it made me so happy that I

00:13:23.317 --> 00:13:25.394
offer it to you,
even though it isn't directly

00:13:25.394 --> 00:13:27.730
related to the point I'm making,
but I kind of couldn't believe

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:28.730
he wrote it in his letter.
 

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.312
So he offers that quote and
then he adds and says,

00:13:31.312 --> 00:13:34.423
"If this Letter should be
preserved and read an hundred

00:13:34.423 --> 00:13:35.690
years hence--".
 

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:35.885
Okay.
 

00:13:35.885 --> 00:13:37.613
First of all,
I love the fact that that comes

00:13:37.613 --> 00:13:38.320
up in his mind.
 

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.678
Well, a hundred years from now
when people are reading my

00:13:40.678 --> 00:13:42.417
letter,
"if this letter should be

00:13:42.417 --> 00:13:44.350
preserved and read an hundred
years hence,

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:47.087
the Reader will say,
'the envy of this John Adams

00:13:47.087 --> 00:13:49.769
could not bear to think of the
Truth!'"

00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:51.120
So in other words,
a hundred years from now if

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.440
people read this letter they're
going to say,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:52.740
'Yeah.
 

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.129
Well, the fact is Adams knew he
wouldn't be remembered.

00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:57.230
He doesn't deserve to be
remembered anyway.'

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:00.206
So it's like first there's the
letter where he's like:

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.769
'oh,
no one's going to know the

00:14:01.769 --> 00:14:04.470
truth about the Revolution and
they're never going to give me

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.100
any credit.
 

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.250
[laughter]
I love the weird self-awareness

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:09.480
of John Adams.
 

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.200
I just--I couldn't believe that
he added that into the letter.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.768
So anyway, I think he certainly
knew what he was talking about

00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:17.547
when he talked about the weird,
general sort of hero-way in

00:14:17.547 --> 00:14:20.341
which people were going to be
thinking about the American

00:14:20.341 --> 00:14:21.038
Revolution.
 

00:14:21.038 --> 00:14:24.676
So many Americans know
certainly Benedict Arnold equals

00:14:24.676 --> 00:14:25.350
traitor.
 

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.850
Obviously, it's--I'm going to
be talking about it today--

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.110
his story is a lot more complex
than that,

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.750
and it's mixed in with these
other two stories,

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.758
that of Peggy Shippen,
who eventually becomes his

00:14:36.758 --> 00:14:40.513
wife,
and John Andre who is a young

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:42.418
British officer.
 

00:14:42.418 --> 00:14:46.336
Now Arnold started out life in
many ways a sort of typical

00:14:46.336 --> 00:14:48.846
member of a modest,
respectable family,

00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:51.628
and at the opening of the
American Revolution he was a

00:14:51.628 --> 00:14:54.225
book-seller and a pharmacist,
or what they would have called

00:14:54.225 --> 00:14:56.730
a druggist,
in New Haven, Connecticut.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.899
So he's a local boy,
Benedict Arnold.

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:01.139
He was struggling to better
himself.

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:04.179
How many of you knew actually
that Benedict Arnold was a local

00:15:04.179 --> 00:15:04.480
guy?
 

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.298
A couple people did.
 

00:15:06.298 --> 00:15:07.985
That was another one of those
things that--I never know when I

00:15:07.985 --> 00:15:08.870
say something about New Haven.
 

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.174
Is it like, 'We all know this
about New Haven,

00:15:11.174 --> 00:15:12.200
Professor Freeman.
 

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.451
You are the clueless person.'
 

00:15:13.451 --> 00:15:15.428
[laughter]
So anyway, he was a local boy.

00:15:15.428 --> 00:15:19.707
So book-seller,
druggist, New Haven local boy

00:15:19.707 --> 00:15:24.107
struggling to better himself,
and part of the way in which

00:15:24.107 --> 00:15:26.686
he's struggling to better
himself is to certainly display

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:29.538
himself to the world as someone
who's really up and coming.

00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:31.110
So among the things that he was
doing was,

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:33.928
he apparently was building an
enormous mansion for himself on

00:15:33.928 --> 00:15:36.142
Water Street,
wearing very expensive

00:15:36.142 --> 00:15:40.129
clothing, taking big risks in
business to try and get himself

00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:41.259
ahead quickly.
 

00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:45.815
He was also a captain in the
local New Haven militia and so

00:15:45.815 --> 00:15:50.370
he was really active drilling at
the opening of the war.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.990
Now when gunplay broke out at
Lexington and Concord,

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.721
the New Haven town meeting
apparently decided that they

00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:59.813
wanted to maintain neutrality,
which in and of itself was kind

00:15:59.813 --> 00:16:00.548
of interesting.
 

00:16:00.548 --> 00:16:00.822
Right?
 

00:16:00.822 --> 00:16:01.139
'Uh oh.
 

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:02.408
Something bad's happening.
 

00:16:02.408 --> 00:16:04.418
I think for now we want to be
neutral.'

00:16:04.418 --> 00:16:07.166
Connecticut's always a very
conservative place so this is

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:10.058
yet another conservative moment
in Connecticut's history.

00:16:10.058 --> 00:16:12.601
So they form a committee--The
town meeting forms a committee

00:16:12.601 --> 00:16:14.240
to preserve neutrality in New
Haven.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.285
Arnold was not really excited
about this concept of

00:16:17.285 --> 00:16:20.234
neutrality,
so apparently he stormed in to

00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:24.028
this neutrality committee,
demanded the keys to the

00:16:24.028 --> 00:16:26.851
ammunition shed,
and when his superior in the

00:16:26.851 --> 00:16:29.836
Connecticut militia told him the
town had legally voted for

00:16:29.836 --> 00:16:32.167
neutrality,
Arnold threatened to break down

00:16:32.167 --> 00:16:35.231
the ammunition shed door with
his men if they didn't hand over

00:16:35.231 --> 00:16:37.995
the keys so he could get
ammunition and take his men and

00:16:37.995 --> 00:16:38.899
do something.
 

00:16:38.899 --> 00:16:42.735
And the committee released the
keys and Arnold took them and

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:45.488
armed his men,
and ultimately he and his

00:16:45.488 --> 00:16:48.258
militia unit joined the
Continental Army in

00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.379
Massachusetts.
 

00:16:49.379 --> 00:16:52.360
So this is someone who clearly
is eager to fight.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:52.738
Right?
 

00:16:52.738 --> 00:16:54.629
He sort of forced his way in.
 

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:57.908
So he ends up in Massachusetts
with his men.

00:16:57.908 --> 00:17:01.871
He's soon promoted to be a
colonel by the Massachusetts

00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:05.558
Committee of Safety,
which assigned him to be part

00:17:05.558 --> 00:17:09.694
of a group that was going to go
help capture Fort Ticonderoga

00:17:09.694 --> 00:17:12.528
and he was--
Arnold was part of that

00:17:12.528 --> 00:17:15.190
successful effort in May of
1775.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:19.838
And by October of 1776,
he was a brigadier general.

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:24.119
Now at this point the very
hierarchical system of military

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:28.401
rank that Arnold was using to
try and raise himself in the

00:17:28.401 --> 00:17:32.869
world began to work against him,
because a number of his equals

00:17:32.869 --> 00:17:36.750
were promoted to major general,
but Arnold wasn't.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.608
And as I'm going to explain in
a moment,

00:17:38.608 --> 00:17:42.491
the reason why he didn't get a
promotion has more to do with

00:17:42.491 --> 00:17:46.703
things like regionalism and fear
of centralized authority than it

00:17:46.703 --> 00:17:50.848
actually does have anything to
do with Arnold specifically.

00:17:50.848 --> 00:17:53.183
So basically,
many of the more radical

00:17:53.183 --> 00:17:56.464
members of the Continental
Congress at this time were

00:17:56.464 --> 00:18:00.186
afraid that if everyone was
promoted in the Continental Army

00:18:00.186 --> 00:18:03.846
just according to seniority of
rank that the army would get

00:18:03.846 --> 00:18:07.568
detached from the legislature
and then it would be seniority

00:18:07.568 --> 00:18:11.670
and not Congress that would be
determining promotions,

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.680
so Congress might end up being
powerless over the army.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.770
And so the result that they
feared would be maybe a military

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.473
dictatorship,
an aristocracy based on high

00:18:21.473 --> 00:18:23.535
military rank--
that somehow or other,

00:18:23.535 --> 00:18:26.068
if the army had control of
promotion everything was going

00:18:26.068 --> 00:18:28.740
to spin out of control and
Congress would have no power.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.038
So, afraid of this,
Congress debated and ultimately

00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:36.130
decided that officers should be
appointed not just according to

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.788
seniority,
but almost more important,

00:18:38.788 --> 00:18:42.445
on the basis of balancing out
the numbers of officers from

00:18:42.445 --> 00:18:43.730
different states.
 

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:43.957
Okay.
 

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:46.368
So they figure we're going to
have regional balance.

00:18:46.368 --> 00:18:49.634
We're going to maintain control
of the promotion process and

00:18:49.634 --> 00:18:52.680
maintain regional balance in the
numbers of officers.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.538
So essentially in the interest
of preserving a national

00:18:57.538 --> 00:19:02.038
confederation of some kind,
regional balance in the

00:19:02.038 --> 00:19:04.920
military was given priority.
 

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.990
As Washington--George
Washington explained to Arnold

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.400
when Arnold was denied his
promotion,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.009
"as Connecticut had
already two major-generals,

00:19:14.009 --> 00:19:16.250
it was their full share."
 

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.457
Okay.
 

00:19:16.457 --> 00:19:18.490
That's got to be really sour
grapes, like 'What?

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.715
[laughs]
Connecticut doesn't deserve any

00:19:20.715 --> 00:19:23.568
more major generals so I don't
get a promotion?'

00:19:23.568 --> 00:19:25.808
"I confess this is a
strange mode of reasoning;

00:19:25.808 --> 00:19:28.387
but it may serve to show you,
that the promotion,

00:19:28.387 --> 00:19:31.663
that was due to your seniority,
was not overlooked for want of

00:19:31.663 --> 00:19:32.900
merit in you."
 

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.269
So he's trying to make Arnold
feel better.

00:19:34.269 --> 00:19:35.700
'Well, you actually--I know you
deserved it but I'm sorry.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:39.438
You really can't have it,
because Connecticut doesn't get

00:19:39.438 --> 00:19:41.038
any more for a while.'
 

00:19:41.038 --> 00:19:41.434
Okay.
 

00:19:41.434 --> 00:19:45.472
Arnold did not get his
promotion, did not get it for

00:19:45.472 --> 00:19:46.819
want of merit.
 

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:49.098
This did not make him happy.
 

00:19:49.098 --> 00:19:52.589
Washington's trying to explain
that there are larger principles

00:19:52.589 --> 00:19:54.871
at play,
principles that show how

00:19:54.871 --> 00:19:58.680
fearful people were of
centralized power in any form,

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.810
and in this case they're afraid
of some kind of powerful

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.446
standing army,
and they're using regional

00:20:04.446 --> 00:20:08.551
balance as a priority to sort of
balance out fears of centralized

00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:12.078
power wherever they're afraid
it's going to crop up.

00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:14.509
As one congressman wrote at the
time,

00:20:14.509 --> 00:20:17.338
Arnold's promotion was blocked
because it raised,

00:20:17.338 --> 00:20:20.311
quote, "a question of
monarchical or republican

00:20:20.311 --> 00:20:22.759
principles at a most crucial
time."

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:26.222
So you could see even this one
guy's promotion is being tied

00:20:26.222 --> 00:20:28.630
into these much larger fears and
ideas.

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:32.808
Congress felt compelled to
establish its promotion policy

00:20:32.808 --> 00:20:37.362
based on fears of an independent
standing army that might take

00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.930
power for itself.
 

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.640
They're trying to keep control
of military promotion--

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.230
so here you see fear of a
standing army,

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.814
fear of centralized power and
regionalism all stirred up and

00:20:48.814 --> 00:20:50.990
all at play in full force.
 

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.894
Now luckily for Arnold at this
point, there was a military

00:20:54.894 --> 00:20:56.538
action in Connecticut.
 

00:20:56.538 --> 00:20:59.508
Arnold proved himself
militarily--yet again he ends up

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.578
getting promoted to major
general--

00:21:01.578 --> 00:21:05.362
but now his rank is beneath
those who had been his equals

00:21:05.362 --> 00:21:05.970
before.
 

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:06.285
Right?
 

00:21:06.285 --> 00:21:09.597
They had been promoted ahead of
him so they still have seniority

00:21:09.597 --> 00:21:10.230
over him.
 

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:15.270
Arnold really wants equal rank,
equal seniority with the men he

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.630
had formerly been equal to.
 

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:21.608
He also felt that Congress owed
him money because he had been

00:21:21.608 --> 00:21:24.858
using his personal funds to
supply his troops,

00:21:24.858 --> 00:21:28.118
and obviously he's already
living well beyond his means,

00:21:28.118 --> 00:21:31.278
so this question of whether or
not he's actually owed money by

00:21:31.278 --> 00:21:34.178
Congress and whether or not
Congress is actually going to

00:21:34.178 --> 00:21:37.173
pay him back--
for him, that's a serious

00:21:37.173 --> 00:21:38.000
question.
 

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.865
The more that Arnold demanded
that he be promoted to the level

00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:47.056
of his former equals,
the stronger Congress dug in

00:21:47.056 --> 00:21:51.564
its heels and refused to comply,
so that the whole idea clearly

00:21:51.564 --> 00:21:54.996
is becoming now a matter of
principle in which the honor and

00:21:54.996 --> 00:21:58.194
authority of the Continental
Congress is at stake now in

00:21:58.194 --> 00:22:01.220
addition to whatever larger
issues are at play.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:04.240
And this might sound a little
familiar if you think back to

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.054
some of the logic deployed by
the British Parliament as

00:22:07.054 --> 00:22:09.920
problems were growing out of
questions of taxation.

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.163
In addition to all of the
larger problems and concerns

00:22:13.163 --> 00:22:17.021
mixed up in that question,
part of what was at play was

00:22:17.021 --> 00:22:20.631
that Parliament ultimately,
at some point down the road of

00:22:20.631 --> 00:22:23.159
that controversy,
didn't want to lose face by

00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:26.019
seeming to surrender the issue
to its colonies.

00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:28.876
So the honor of Parliament is
involved in that issue,

00:22:28.876 --> 00:22:31.348
here the honor of the
Continental Congress.

00:22:31.348 --> 00:22:33.934
They feel like that's at issue
and they can't just back down

00:22:33.934 --> 00:22:36.740
because Arnold is being really
persistent about what he wants.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:40.291
As South Carolina Congressman
Henry Laurens put it at the

00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:42.130
time,
his colleagues' behavior in

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.690
Congress was,
quote, "disgusting."

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:48.194
Arnold was refused "not
because he was deficient in

00:22:48.194 --> 00:22:51.955
merit or that his demand was not
well founded but because he

00:22:51.955 --> 00:22:54.442
asked for it &amp;
that granting at such

00:22:54.442 --> 00:22:58.838
insistence would be derogatory
to the honour of Congress."

00:22:58.838 --> 00:23:01.808
Now that's Laurens' point of
view.

00:23:01.808 --> 00:23:04.430
Another congressman with
different politics and another

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.244
point of view came up with a
whole different way of looking

00:23:07.244 --> 00:23:09.863
at this whole controversy--
drew very different

00:23:09.863 --> 00:23:13.261
conclusions--and said that
denying Arnold his promotion was

00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:15.490
a triumph of republican
principles.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.730
Military rank would stay in
control of the legislature;

00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:24.440
the army wouldn't become
independent and aristocratic.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.179
So you can see even again
something that is seemingly not

00:23:27.179 --> 00:23:29.633
that important,
which is the promotion of one

00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:32.671
guy, stirs up all of these
larger issues for all kinds of

00:23:32.671 --> 00:23:34.190
people in different ways.
 

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.140
People aren't even united about
what it means.

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.798
Now it was at roughly this
moment--

00:23:39.798 --> 00:23:43.058
when Arnold is frustrated--he
wants promotion--

00:23:43.058 --> 00:23:45.054
he doesn't see a way to get
it--he keeps getting turned

00:23:45.054 --> 00:23:47.400
down--
he feels like he's owed money

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.673
in some way--
he just feels basically stymied

00:23:50.673 --> 00:23:53.121
in every way--
his reputation now he also

00:23:53.121 --> 00:23:55.856
feels is being attacked simply
because he's asking for

00:23:55.856 --> 00:23:58.219
promotion--
this is roughly the time when

00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:01.227
he met Peggy Shippen,
who was the daughter of a

00:24:01.227 --> 00:24:03.548
wealthy merchant in
Philadelphia.

00:24:03.548 --> 00:24:06.528
Now the Shippens,
along with any number of

00:24:06.528 --> 00:24:09.868
Philadelphia's other sort of
best families,

00:24:09.868 --> 00:24:13.486
mingled freely with British
officers when the British were

00:24:13.486 --> 00:24:17.016
in occupation of Philadelphia--
when the British were not

00:24:17.016 --> 00:24:19.660
there, mingled freely with
American officers.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.009
When the British had possession
of Philadelphia apparently there

00:24:23.009 --> 00:24:26.519
were elaborate dances and great
sorts of theatrical productions.

00:24:26.519 --> 00:24:29.538
It was a grand social scene
when the British were there.

00:24:29.538 --> 00:24:32.009
When the British were not
there, Americans also had

00:24:32.009 --> 00:24:32.848
entertainments.
 

00:24:32.848 --> 00:24:35.945
They weren't quite as
extravagant, but still enough to

00:24:35.945 --> 00:24:39.276
encourage the participation of
all of the best families of

00:24:39.276 --> 00:24:40.269
Philadelphia.
 

00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:43.736
Peggy Shippen was certainly in
the midst of all of this

00:24:43.736 --> 00:24:46.271
socializing,
enjoying whatever socializing

00:24:46.271 --> 00:24:48.170
was going on with whatever
group,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.990
and apparently she was very
popular.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.561
She was sort of the literal
belle of the ball,

00:24:53.561 --> 00:24:56.707
one of the more attractive and
noteworthy young women in

00:24:56.707 --> 00:24:59.279
Philadelphia's social scene at
that time.

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:02.377
Now this suggests a few things
about Peggy Shippen,

00:25:02.377 --> 00:25:05.910
one or two of which are
significant for our story here.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.819
For one obvious thing,
it suggests that she certainly

00:25:08.819 --> 00:25:11.058
was dressed at the height of
fashion,

00:25:11.058 --> 00:25:13.740
that she was skilled at
flirtation,

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.920
that she was aggressive in
social circles,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.288
but what that adds up to as far
as our story is concerned,

00:25:19.288 --> 00:25:22.577
is that she was displaying
ambition on one of the few

00:25:22.577 --> 00:25:25.740
stages where women could display
open ambition,

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.329
and that's social events,
social functions,

00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:30.710
in a sense the private world.
 

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.890
But certainly on the social
stage,

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.638
that's a place where women
could successfully display and

00:25:35.638 --> 00:25:38.429
exercise ambition,
and it certainly suggests that

00:25:38.429 --> 00:25:41.712
Peggy Shippen was perfectly
comfortable doing that on the

00:25:41.712 --> 00:25:43.588
social scene of Philadelphia.
 

00:25:43.588 --> 00:25:49.250
So Peggy married Benedict
Arnold in April of 1779.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.990
He already was someone who was
spending extravagantly.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.342
This just encouraged him to
increase his spending,

00:25:55.342 --> 00:25:57.838
because now he had a wife to
spend on, in addition to

00:25:57.838 --> 00:25:59.759
whatever he was spending on
himself.

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:01.778
And it was shortly after his
marriage,

00:26:01.778 --> 00:26:04.625
when he still remained
frustrated in his military

00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:06.646
hopes,
his expenses are rising and

00:26:06.646 --> 00:26:09.916
rising all the time,
this is the moment where he

00:26:09.916 --> 00:26:14.108
began to ponder the possibility
of aiding the British.

00:26:14.108 --> 00:26:17.589
And apparently in his mind he
justified his actions by

00:26:17.589 --> 00:26:21.528
assuming the British were
inevitably going to win anyway,

00:26:21.528 --> 00:26:24.125
that the British--that the
likelihood that the colonies

00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.529
were going to be victorious
against the empire,

00:26:26.529 --> 00:26:28.078
in his mind, is unlikely.
 

00:26:28.078 --> 00:26:31.548
So given that the British are
inevitably going to win,

00:26:31.548 --> 00:26:34.944
his helping them win the war is
going to end bloodshed as

00:26:34.944 --> 00:26:37.713
quickly as possible,
so he's doing a good thing by

00:26:37.713 --> 00:26:39.088
somehow helping the British.
 

00:26:39.088 --> 00:26:41.252
Now clearly that's a sort of
self-serving way of looking at

00:26:41.252 --> 00:26:41.440
it.
 

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.960
He has other motives too,
but that was part of his logic.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.930
So in May of 1779,
he and Peggy decided to ask a

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.239
local man in Philadelphia who
they knew had Loyalist

00:26:53.239 --> 00:26:58.308
sympathies and who was a poet to
act as a go-between with the

00:26:58.308 --> 00:27:03.970
British so they could at least
open a conversation with them.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.440
And this man,
whose name was Joseph

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.000
Stansbury, later described
Arnold's invitation.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.240
He described what Arnold said
to him at this moment:

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.440
"General Arnold sent for
me and,

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.138
after some general
conversation,

00:27:17.138 --> 00:27:20.481
opened his political sentiments
respecting the war carrying on

00:27:20.481 --> 00:27:22.618
between Great Britain and
America,

00:27:22.618 --> 00:27:25.250
declaring his abhorrence of a
separation of the latter from

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:27.788
the former as a measure that
would be ruinous to both.

00:27:27.788 --> 00:27:30.788
General Arnold then
communicated to me,

00:27:30.788 --> 00:27:33.250
under a solemn obligation of
secrecy,

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.830
his intention of offering his
services to the

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:39.057
Commander-in-Chief of the
British forces in any way that

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:42.284
would most effectually restore
the former government and

00:27:42.284 --> 00:27:45.568
destroy the [then]
usurped authority of Congress,

00:27:45.568 --> 00:27:49.190
either by immediately joining
the British Army or cooperating

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:52.509
on some concerted plan with Sir
Henry Clinton"--

00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:55.048
(who is the British commander
in chief).

00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:55.347
Yeah.
 

00:27:55.347 --> 00:27:57.618
That's quite some conversation
there.

00:27:57.618 --> 00:28:01.396
Now the person who ultimately
ended up facilitating

00:28:01.396 --> 00:28:06.005
communication between Arnold and
Sir Henry Clinton was a young

00:28:06.005 --> 00:28:09.328
British officer named Major John
Andre,

00:28:09.328 --> 00:28:11.670
who was a sort of favorite of
Henry Clinton,

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.269
was sort of his right-hand man.
 

00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:15.788
Apparently, Peggy Shippen knew
him.

00:28:15.788 --> 00:28:18.670
They had met when the British
had been in Philadelphia,

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.922
and in fact they'd been a
little bit flirtatious when the

00:28:20.922 --> 00:28:24.108
British were in Philadelphia,
so they knew each other.

00:28:24.108 --> 00:28:28.086
To most people who knew
Andre--and as we're going to see

00:28:28.086 --> 00:28:30.833
later on in this story,
particularly to

00:28:30.833 --> 00:28:34.809
Americans--Andre was the very
ideal of a gentleman.

00:28:34.809 --> 00:28:36.339
He was charming.
 

00:28:36.339 --> 00:28:38.140
He was well educated.
 

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.609
He wrote poetry.
 

00:28:39.609 --> 00:28:41.130
He wrote plays.
 

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.019
He was flirtatious.
 

00:28:43.019 --> 00:28:46.558
He drew portraits to amuse the
ladies and his fellow officers.

00:28:46.558 --> 00:28:48.098
He's supposedly very
good-looking.

00:28:48.098 --> 00:28:50.759
So basically in a sense,
Andre is sort of this

00:28:50.759 --> 00:28:53.421
gentlemanly ideal,
and then he's also this gallant

00:28:53.421 --> 00:28:55.564
soldier,
so you add it all up and it's

00:28:55.564 --> 00:28:58.759
just a package of sort of
"ideal gentleman."

00:28:58.759 --> 00:29:01.836
Like Arnold,
Andre had used the army as a

00:29:01.836 --> 00:29:05.682
way to better his station,
although his station was

00:29:05.682 --> 00:29:07.990
already somewhat elevated.
 

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:10.970
So Andre's father was a wealthy
merchant.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.643
Andre thought that trade was a
little bit disreputable so he

00:29:14.643 --> 00:29:18.130
decided that the army was a
better way for him to advance

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.380
himself,
exercise his ambition,

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.710
and achieve fame and glory,
again not that unlike Arnold.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:29.469
So Andre ends up being at the
center of Arnold's plans with

00:29:29.469 --> 00:29:32.519
the British,
and basically the plan was the

00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:35.250
Arnolds would send messages to
the British,

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:38.730
but they would be written by
Peggy Arnold and then sent to

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.336
Andre through Joseph Stansbury
who would pick up the letters

00:29:42.336 --> 00:29:45.286
and deliver them,
crossing back and forth between

00:29:45.286 --> 00:29:48.798
American and British lines,
and then Andre could go on and

00:29:48.798 --> 00:29:50.940
speak to Henry Clinton himself.
 

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.297
Now Stansbury,
hoping to make things a little

00:29:53.297 --> 00:29:56.916
less risky for himself,
got another poet that he knew

00:29:56.916 --> 00:30:01.371
behind British lines to carry
the messages from his hand to

00:30:01.371 --> 00:30:02.598
Andre's hand.
 

00:30:02.598 --> 00:30:05.594
So Benedict Arnold's
negotiations with the British

00:30:05.594 --> 00:30:08.847
would be written out by Peggy;
she'd give her letters to

00:30:08.847 --> 00:30:10.786
Stansbury;
Stansbury would give them to

00:30:10.786 --> 00:30:12.914
another poet;
the poet would give them to

00:30:12.914 --> 00:30:14.940
Andre;
Andre would take them to

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.558
Clinton.
 

00:30:15.558 --> 00:30:15.796
Okay.
 

00:30:15.796 --> 00:30:18.586
That's a long chain of people,
but what's really interesting

00:30:18.586 --> 00:30:21.188
about that chain of people is
that when you think of the

00:30:21.188 --> 00:30:23.788
pieces and the assumptions
underlying the pieces,

00:30:23.788 --> 00:30:27.982
it revealed a lot about society
and some of its assumptions at

00:30:27.982 --> 00:30:28.740
the time.
 

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:32.102
It was actually Andre who
suggested that the letters

00:30:32.102 --> 00:30:35.596
should at least seem to be
written by Peggy Arnold and

00:30:35.596 --> 00:30:38.605
addressed to Andre,
because Andre knew that

00:30:38.605 --> 00:30:42.202
something written by a woman
would never be assumed to have

00:30:42.202 --> 00:30:44.618
anything to do with politics or
war.

00:30:44.618 --> 00:30:47.159
A letter from a woman is going
to assume to be private and

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:47.650
personal.
 

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.980
Women were basically a
nonentity in public life,

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.338
they didn't exist as public
figures,

00:30:52.338 --> 00:30:55.358
so, as Andre explained in a
note to the Arnolds,

00:30:55.358 --> 00:30:57.509
"The Lady,"
meaning Peggy,

00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:59.298
"might write to me...
 

00:30:59.298 --> 00:31:02.644
This will come by a flag of
truce, every messenger remaining

00:31:02.644 --> 00:31:05.308
ignorant of what they are
charged with."

00:31:05.308 --> 00:31:06.970
These will seem like private
letters.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.140
They can kind of write in code.
 

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:09.150
It'll come from a woman.
 

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.278
No one will know what they are,
and under a flag of truce,

00:31:12.278 --> 00:31:14.650
messengers will help deliver
these messages and no one will

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.365
know what they are,
because they're written by a

00:31:17.365 --> 00:31:17.818
woman.
 

00:31:17.818 --> 00:31:21.816
So their letters to each other
could seem to talk about things

00:31:21.816 --> 00:31:25.484
like parties and dances and what
Andre termed "other

00:31:25.484 --> 00:31:26.730
nonsense."
 

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:26.967
Right?
 

00:31:26.967 --> 00:31:29.337
They can pretend to be talking
about whatever they're talking

00:31:29.337 --> 00:31:31.670
about but they're going to
actually send coded messages.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:35.128
And these letters would be
passed through both the American

00:31:35.128 --> 00:31:38.827
and British lines because they
would supposedly have nothing to

00:31:38.827 --> 00:31:42.414
do with the war,
because they were from or to a

00:31:42.414 --> 00:31:42.960
woman.
 

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.317
Okay.
 

00:31:43.317 --> 00:31:47.463
So part of this whole plan of
espionage is built around the

00:31:47.463 --> 00:31:51.538
simple fact that women were
invisible in public life,

00:31:51.538 --> 00:31:55.088
so they were very useful agents
of espionage.

00:31:55.088 --> 00:31:59.876
It's also interesting to note
that both the Arnolds' chosen

00:31:59.876 --> 00:32:02.056
messenger,
Stansbury, and

00:32:02.056 --> 00:32:06.009
Stanbury--Stansbury's chosen
messenger to Andre,

00:32:06.009 --> 00:32:09.421
both of them were poets,
and in a sense poets were also

00:32:09.421 --> 00:32:13.085
people who would not necessarily
be assumed to be centrally

00:32:13.085 --> 00:32:15.170
involved with fighting a war.
 

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:19.490
It could have been quite
natural for American and British

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.269
men of letters to chat,
to meet, to correspond.

00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:27.509
Cultural bonds--for example an
interest in the art of poetry--

00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:30.358
could easily cross political
boundaries,

00:32:30.358 --> 00:32:33.088
and Andre himself was a poet of
sorts,

00:32:33.088 --> 00:32:36.864
so that too showed something
interesting about society at the

00:32:36.864 --> 00:32:40.323
time: this assumption that
common cultural bonds between

00:32:40.323 --> 00:32:43.971
American and British men of
letters and literature could be

00:32:43.971 --> 00:32:46.740
assumed to be above politics and
war,

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:50.019
above national bonds enough
that it might help them pass

00:32:50.019 --> 00:32:53.118
back and forth between American
and British lines.

00:32:53.118 --> 00:32:53.529
Okay.
 

00:32:53.529 --> 00:32:56.720
So using this whole string of
people,

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.776
this string of poets,
Arnold and the British

00:32:59.776 --> 00:33:03.827
negotiated for a time and then
stopped because the British

00:33:03.827 --> 00:33:08.164
would not promise to give Arnold
the huge sum of money that he

00:33:08.164 --> 00:33:10.440
demanded for his services.
 

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.074
A year later in 1780,
negotiations began again,

00:33:14.074 --> 00:33:18.500
this time focused on a specific
demand by the British.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.557
The British specifically asked
Arnold for his help in getting

00:33:22.557 --> 00:33:25.808
control of West Point,
and Arnold felt that he could

00:33:25.808 --> 00:33:28.819
probably get command of West
Point and then find a way to

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:30.380
deliver it to the British.
 

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.162
And in exchange for this
mission Arnold wanted 30,000

00:33:34.162 --> 00:33:37.580
pounds sterling,
which is a vast sum of money at

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:38.598
this time.
 

00:33:38.598 --> 00:33:42.740
I think--sterling to dollar I
can't translate,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.262
but just to give you a sense--I
believe that when the government

00:33:46.262 --> 00:33:49.855
gets under way,
George Washington is making a

00:33:49.855 --> 00:33:54.940
salary of $25,000 a year and
that's a big blob of money.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.373
I think Secretary of State,
Secretary of the Treasury were

00:33:58.373 --> 00:34:00.118
making $5,000 a year maybe.
 

00:34:00.118 --> 00:34:03.230
So 30,000 pounds sterling is a
lot of money.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.240
Plus, he wanted payment of all
of his debts.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.588
So he's not being modest.
 

00:34:07.588 --> 00:34:10.304
But General
Clinton--communicating through

00:34:10.304 --> 00:34:14.275
Andre--refused to commit any
money to Arnold until Arnold had

00:34:14.275 --> 00:34:16.659
actually accomplished something.
 

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:16.907
Right?
 

00:34:16.907 --> 00:34:19.309
He doesn't at this point even
have command of West Point.

00:34:19.309 --> 00:34:22.824
So at this point with their
plan almost foiled,

00:34:22.824 --> 00:34:26.949
things go perhaps one step
worse when George Washington

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:30.539
asks to see Arnold and tries to
reward him.

00:34:30.539 --> 00:34:31.510
Right? He still feels bad.
 

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:33.300
The guy didn't get the
promotion he wanted.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.356
Washington says he's going to
try to reward him by giving him

00:34:36.356 --> 00:34:38.139
a better command than West
Point.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:38.353
Right?
 

00:34:38.353 --> 00:34:40.320
West Point's not really in the
center of the fighting.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.188
Washington basically says,
'You don't really want West

00:34:42.188 --> 00:34:42.469
Point.
 

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:45.255
I'll give you something better
than West Point,' and,

00:34:45.255 --> 00:34:48.364
as Washington later recorded,
Arnold had a strange reaction

00:34:48.364 --> 00:34:49.329
to this offer.
 

00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:52.275
Quote: "Upon this
information his countenance

00:34:52.275 --> 00:34:54.980
changed and he appeared to be
quite fallen;

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.739
and, instead of thanking me,
or expressing any pleasure at

00:34:57.739 --> 00:35:00.400
the appointment,
never opened his mouth"--

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.369
okay, because he--Arnold's
like, 'uh oh,

00:35:03.369 --> 00:35:06.469
[laughs]
this is not what I expected.'

00:35:06.469 --> 00:35:06.822
Right?
 

00:35:06.822 --> 00:35:10.175
Peggy Arnold when informed in
Philadelphia that Arnold had

00:35:10.175 --> 00:35:13.824
been promised a better command
than West Point apparently burst

00:35:13.824 --> 00:35:17.295
into hysterics and then after
regaining herself said she was

00:35:17.295 --> 00:35:21.179
sobbing because of the danger
that this put her husband in.

00:35:21.179 --> 00:35:21.478
Okay.
 

00:35:21.478 --> 00:35:24.643
She's really sobbing because
their plan is about to be

00:35:24.643 --> 00:35:26.974
foiled,
but her explanation again sort

00:35:26.974 --> 00:35:29.599
of took advantage of stereotypes
about women,

00:35:29.599 --> 00:35:32.574
in this case capitalizing on
the assumption that women were

00:35:32.574 --> 00:35:35.190
not involved in such things as
military commands;

00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:37.719
they would just be worried
about their husbands' welfare.

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.530
So that's the excuse she comes
up with,

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:42.394
and we're going to see her
deploy this really successfully

00:35:42.394 --> 00:35:45.260
in just a few minutes at the
sort of penultimate moment of

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.119
crisis in this whole
controversy.

00:35:47.119 --> 00:35:50.378
Ultimately, that offer of
another command for Arnold fell

00:35:50.378 --> 00:35:53.230
through and he was given command
of West Point.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:57.123
And through that whole chain of
letter exchanges it was quickly

00:35:57.123 --> 00:36:00.831
established that Arnold and
Andre and Clinton were now ready

00:36:00.831 --> 00:36:02.590
to actually do business.
 

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:07.268
But now at this crucial point
someone had to speak with Arnold

00:36:07.268 --> 00:36:10.260
in person to make final
arrangements.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.159
And here we get yet another
example of how important it was

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:17.119
for young men to gain status in
the army--

00:36:17.119 --> 00:36:20.077
and actually young men of all
kinds to gain status in the

00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:22.235
army--
and how useful the army could

00:36:22.235 --> 00:36:25.230
be for promoting your own status
and reputation,

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.699
even for people who already had
some social status--

00:36:28.699 --> 00:36:33.139
because in this case Andre's
commander in chief and friend,

00:36:33.139 --> 00:36:35.847
General Clinton,
said the mission was too

00:36:35.847 --> 00:36:38.623
dangerous for his favorite
right-hand man.

00:36:38.623 --> 00:36:39.300
Right?
 

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.900
He says to Andre,
'This is not for you.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:44.295
This is too dangerous,' but
Andre actually insisted on being

00:36:44.295 --> 00:36:47.748
the communicator between Clinton
and Arnold because he really

00:36:47.748 --> 00:36:51.202
desperately wanted a chance to
earn a promotion and he really

00:36:51.202 --> 00:36:54.829
thought that this moment of
potential glory could be it,

00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:56.250
could be his big chance.
 

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.570
So Andre and Arnold met;
they talked.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.740
Throughout his trip to meet
with Arnold and during the

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.380
visit,
Andre claimed to be a merchant

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:08.268
named John Anderson--
right?--and he wore this sort

00:37:08.268 --> 00:37:10.728
of cloak,
but it's important to note that

00:37:10.728 --> 00:37:14.000
underneath his cloak he had on
his British uniform.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.351
And this was important because
if he was captured in his

00:37:17.351 --> 00:37:21.005
official uniform,
he would be a prisoner of war

00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:24.708
and thus protected,
even possibly traded back to

00:37:24.708 --> 00:37:29.070
the British in exchange for a
high-ranking American prisoner,

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.900
but if he was in plain clothes
he would be a lowly spy,

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.820
and a spy had only one fate
waiting for him and that was

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.829
death by hanging.
 

00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:40.500
So he's cloaked but he does
have on his British uniform.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:40.827
Okay.
 

00:37:40.827 --> 00:37:44.632
Complications naturally arose
when a friend of Arnold's saw

00:37:44.632 --> 00:37:46.469
Andre with the cloak off.
 

00:37:46.469 --> 00:37:46.750
Right?
 

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:48.429
So the friend of Arnold says,
'Wow.

00:37:48.429 --> 00:37:49.949
You're chatting with a British
officer.

00:37:49.949 --> 00:37:52.170
[laughter] What does that mean?'
 

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:52.418
Okay.
 

00:37:52.418 --> 00:37:55.248
So forced to come up with some
kind of an explanation--you

00:37:55.248 --> 00:37:58.344
could imagine that moment;
that's a big sort of "uh

00:37:58.344 --> 00:37:59.144
oh,
[laughs]

00:37:59.144 --> 00:38:01.980
I'm chatting with a British
officer"--

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:05.440
Arnold said that Andre was a
merchant who had put on a

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.639
British uniform to sneak through
British lines.

00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:08.952
Right?
 

00:38:08.952 --> 00:38:11.922
Quick thinking on Arnold's
part, but Arnold's friend said:

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:12.599
'Oh, okay.
 

00:38:12.599 --> 00:38:15.320
Well, given that'--he says to
Andre--

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.210
'You'd be much safer now just
to dress in plain clothes,

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.302
because now that you're past
British lines you shouldn't be

00:38:21.302 --> 00:38:22.849
wearing a British uniform.'
 

00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:23.105
Okay.
 

00:38:23.105 --> 00:38:26.175
There's not a lot that Andre
can say to that logic so he puts

00:38:26.175 --> 00:38:27.199
on plain clothes.
 

00:38:27.199 --> 00:38:30.023
He's carrying papers from
Arnold about their plot and

00:38:30.023 --> 00:38:33.780
shoves them into his boot,
and Andre then set off to head

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:37.469
back to General Clinton,
had just about made his way

00:38:37.469 --> 00:38:41.139
back to British-claimed
territory when he was stopped by

00:38:41.139 --> 00:38:44.719
three men who questioned him,
searched his clothing,

00:38:44.719 --> 00:38:47.539
and eventually found the papers
in his boot.

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:51.789
And the three men brought Andre
to American authorities.

00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:55.648
Now, even now Andre thought
that maybe he could claim to be

00:38:55.648 --> 00:38:58.110
a secret agent in Arnold's
service.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:38:58.364
Right?
 

00:38:58.364 --> 00:39:00.275
He's--Actually,
he's wearing plain clothes and

00:39:00.275 --> 00:39:02.291
he has papers from Arnold,
so he's thinking:

00:39:02.291 --> 00:39:04.693
'well, there's not actually
anything to link me with the

00:39:04.693 --> 00:39:05.829
British at this moment.
 

00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:09.902
I could just be a lowly spy
doing something for Arnold so

00:39:09.902 --> 00:39:11.650
maybe I'm still okay.'
 

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:16.047
However, the officer who he was
taken to became suspicious when

00:39:16.047 --> 00:39:20.766
Andre was given clean clothes,
and the ribbon that he removed

00:39:20.766 --> 00:39:23.780
from his hair was dusted with
powder.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.239
Okay, the sneaky powder.
 

00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:29.188
What that meant was that he
clearly was a gentleman who

00:39:29.188 --> 00:39:30.280
powdered his hair.
 

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.130
He was not a lowly spy.
 

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.969
So whoever this observant
person was,

00:39:33.969 --> 00:39:36.344
he saw the ribbon,
he saw that it was dusted with

00:39:36.344 --> 00:39:37.748
powder,
and he thought:

00:39:37.748 --> 00:39:40.900
'I don't think you're some
pseudo lowly spy person.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.570
I think you must be someone
more important.

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:45.400
Something fishy is going on
here.'

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.394
So now, this American officer
sent the captured papers on to

00:39:49.394 --> 00:39:50.750
George Washington.
 

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:54.909
Washington, as luck would have
it, was on his way to West Point

00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:56.989
to meet with Benedict Arnold.
 

00:39:56.989 --> 00:39:57.856
[laughter]
Right?

00:39:57.856 --> 00:39:59.969
Talk about your sort of lucky
strike.

00:39:59.969 --> 00:40:00.360
Right?
 

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.480
So he's riding off,
heading to West Point to meet

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.942
with Arnold as a friend,
see how West Point is going,

00:40:06.942 --> 00:40:10.460
and now this letter from Andre
is winging its way to Arnold's

00:40:10.460 --> 00:40:12.219
headquarters at West Point.
 

00:40:12.219 --> 00:40:15.485
When it became obvious that he
was now being really held

00:40:15.485 --> 00:40:17.617
suspect,
Andre confessed who he was,

00:40:17.617 --> 00:40:20.682
and he did so at this early
point so that he could reveal

00:40:20.682 --> 00:40:24.023
that he wasn't a lowly spy but
actually was a gentleman and an

00:40:24.023 --> 00:40:25.829
officer who had been caught.
 

00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:28.018
And to him this really made a
difference.

00:40:28.018 --> 00:40:31.632
As he explained to Washington,
he wasn't revealing his true

00:40:31.632 --> 00:40:34.309
identity for his own safety and
security.

00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:36.070
As he put it,
he wasn't trying to

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:39.260
"rescue himself from an
imputation of having assumed a

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.514
mean character for treacherous
purposes or

00:40:41.514 --> 00:40:44.320
self-interest"--
so he says, 'I'm not revealing

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.389
this because I'm hoping to plead
for my life.'

00:40:46.389 --> 00:40:48.936
Rather, he was revealing his
true identity,

00:40:48.936 --> 00:40:52.391
quote, "to vindicate my
fame" from any suspicion

00:40:52.391 --> 00:40:54.090
that he was a lowly spy.
 

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.351
So basically he's revealing who
he is because he wants to be

00:40:57.351 --> 00:40:59.730
recognized as an officer and a
gentleman.

00:40:59.730 --> 00:41:02.768
And that letter--also sent on
to the headquarters at West

00:41:02.768 --> 00:41:06.079
Point to wait for Washington
when he arrives at West Point.

00:41:06.079 --> 00:41:08.856
Boy, Washington's going to have
fun when he arrives at West

00:41:08.856 --> 00:41:09.239
Point.
 

00:41:09.239 --> 00:41:11.610
Washington has not yet gotten
to Arnold's house.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:17.070
He sent two of his aides ahead
to prepare for his arrival.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.376
They were actually eating
breakfast with Benedict Arnold

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:21.349
when letters began to arrive at
headquarters.

00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:24.413
Realizing that something bad
was unfolding as one after

00:41:24.413 --> 00:41:27.987
another sort of dispatch came in
with these frantic letters that

00:41:27.987 --> 00:41:31.420
had to get to Washington,
Arnold ran upstairs.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:35.373
Washington--Washington's aides
later said he looked oddly

00:41:35.373 --> 00:41:36.150
agitated.
 

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:39.090
He told Peggy that they'd been
caught.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.750
He ran downstairs.
 

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:43.025
He told Washington that--and
his aides actually,

00:41:43.025 --> 00:41:43.849
not Washington.
 

00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:46.717
He's not there yet--he told
Washington's aides that he had

00:41:46.717 --> 00:41:48.931
to go prepare for a reception
for Washington,

00:41:48.931 --> 00:41:50.239
and fled on horseback.
 

00:41:50.239 --> 00:41:51.489
"Poof," he's gone.
 

00:41:51.489 --> 00:41:54.333
And eventually he was taken
aboard a British ship in the

00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:54.800
harbor.
 

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.920
Washington arrived shortly
after this moment,

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.083
reads all of these letters and
messages that are waiting for

00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:02.961
him,
and at this moment Peggy,

00:42:02.961 --> 00:42:06.447
who now knows that things are
really exploding and she's in

00:42:06.447 --> 00:42:09.025
big trouble,
erupts into hysterics,

00:42:09.025 --> 00:42:12.329
entirely flustering all of the
men present--

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:14.000
because she's at this point
surrounded by men--

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.739
right?--her husband's aides,
George Washington,

00:42:15.739 --> 00:42:17.230
George Washington's aides.
 

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.349
She erupts into hysterics and
one of Arnold's aides said,

00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:23.690
"I heard a shriek to me
and sprang from my bed,

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.047
ran upstairs,
and there met the miserable

00:42:26.047 --> 00:42:28.440
lady,
raving, distracted ...

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.710
with her hair disheveled and
flowing about her neck.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:34.320
Her morning gown,
with few other clothes,

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.182
[laughter]
remained on her,

00:42:36.182 --> 00:42:39.840
too few to be seen by a
gentleman of the family,

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.360
much less by many
strangers."

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:45.199
Okay, the semi-nude Peggy
Arnold.

00:42:45.199 --> 00:42:49.280
"She seized me by the hand
with this, to me distressing,

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.000
address, and a wild look,
'Colonel ...

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.293
have you ordered my child to be
killed?'"

00:42:54.293 --> 00:42:54.650
Okay.
 

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:58.130
Peggy raving,
'You're going to kill my baby.'

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.380
She raved apparently for
several days.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.936
Generally speaking,
she could have sincerely been

00:43:02.936 --> 00:43:03.630
distressed.
 

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:03.907
Right?
 

00:43:03.907 --> 00:43:06.077
Her husband just ran off,
things are in trouble,

00:43:06.077 --> 00:43:07.601
Washington's there,
the jig is up,

00:43:07.601 --> 00:43:09.079
people know about the plot.
 

00:43:09.079 --> 00:43:12.773
Her seeming insanity,
raving about a murdered baby,

00:43:12.773 --> 00:43:16.318
maybe not so sincere,
and Washington's aides were

00:43:16.318 --> 00:43:19.199
entirely sucked in to her
distress.

00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:21.891
As Alexander Hamilton put it,
and he was really sucked right

00:43:21.891 --> 00:43:23.670
in there, "one moment she
raved;

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.119
another she melted into tears...
 

00:43:26.119 --> 00:43:29.289
in a manner that would have
pierced insensibility itself....

00:43:29.289 --> 00:43:32.780
It was the most affecting scene
I ever was witness to"

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:35.489
[laughter]--that's on the part
of Hamilton.

00:43:35.489 --> 00:43:35.748
Okay.
 

00:43:35.748 --> 00:43:38.637
So here again is Peggy using
prevailing assumptions about

00:43:38.637 --> 00:43:39.980
women to her advantage.
 

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:40.719
She's raving.
 

00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:41.719
She's hysterical.
 

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:43.139
She's talking about her baby.
 

00:43:43.139 --> 00:43:46.217
She's not wearing very much
clothing, [laughter]

00:43:46.217 --> 00:43:47.070
apparently.
 

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.525
There were many reasons for the
men who were present not to

00:43:50.525 --> 00:43:54.219
suspect that she's actually
involved in the treasonous plot.

00:43:54.219 --> 00:43:56.461
So Arnold is fleeing to a
British ship,

00:43:56.461 --> 00:44:00.003
Andre is an American prisoner,
and Peggy is being doted on by

00:44:00.003 --> 00:44:02.070
half a dozen American officers.
 

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:05.739
[laughter]
By prolonging her hysteria,

00:44:05.739 --> 00:44:08.880
she was playing on what she
knew would be their sense of

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.275
gallantry to help her,
and their emotional response to

00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:15.320
a distraught woman who's sobbing
and semi-nude.

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.840
So eventually she went home to
her family in Philadelphia.

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.690
Andre's fate was still up for
grabs.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.161
He assumed that a gentleman and
officer of his rank would never

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:27.688
be accused of being a lowly spy
and he would be exchanged for an

00:44:27.688 --> 00:44:29.480
equivalent American officer.
 

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.739
But this was not to be.
 

00:44:30.739 --> 00:44:33.909
But interestingly,
while he was in captivity,

00:44:33.909 --> 00:44:37.166
Andre became much more than a
British spy to the American

00:44:37.166 --> 00:44:39.610
officers who were holding him
prisoner,

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.992
because during his captivity
Washington and his aides spent a

00:44:42.992 --> 00:44:46.487
lot of time with him and came to
consider him as the very model

00:44:46.487 --> 00:44:49.250
of what a gentleman and an
officer should be.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:53.179
All of Washington's aides
literally wanted to be Andre.

00:44:53.179 --> 00:44:55.809
Some of them actually said that
in writing: 'I wish I were

00:44:55.809 --> 00:44:56.179
Andre.
 

00:44:56.179 --> 00:44:57.889
[laughter] He's so gallant.
 

00:44:57.889 --> 00:44:58.630
He's so brave.
 

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:00.030
He's so--' Yeah.
 

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:02.429
So Andre really is this ideal.
 

00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:04.320
He's handsome.
 

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.969
He's aristocratically genteel.
 

00:45:05.969 --> 00:45:08.639
He's stoic in the face of
imminent death.

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:11.047
He's willingly sacrificing his
life for his country,

00:45:11.047 --> 00:45:13.409
even if that country is England
and not America.

00:45:13.409 --> 00:45:17.072
Even Washington was taken with
Andre and called him a gallant

00:45:17.072 --> 00:45:18.719
and accomplished officer.
 

00:45:18.719 --> 00:45:22.054
Despite such respect for Andre,
his request to be shot as an

00:45:22.054 --> 00:45:25.730
officer and a gentleman rather
than hanged as a spy was denied.

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:29.032
Washington couldn't grant that
request without raising doubts

00:45:29.032 --> 00:45:30.739
about Andre's guilt as a spy.
 

00:45:30.739 --> 00:45:33.960
So October 1,1780,
was named as the day of Andre's

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.750
execution.
 

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.530
On that day Andre dressed with
extreme care.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.847
He went out of his way to show
his calm fortitude and his

00:45:40.847 --> 00:45:43.750
gentility and his dignity in the
face of death.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.860
He was a true British officer
to the last,

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.340
because apparently as he walked
to the scaffold he said,

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.746
quote, "I am very much
surprised to find your troops

00:45:52.746 --> 00:45:54.250
under such good
discipline."

00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:56.909
[laughter] Can you imagine?
 

00:45:56.909 --> 00:45:57.719
'I'm about to die.
 

00:45:57.719 --> 00:46:00.260
My, you Americans are quite
disciplined, aren't you?'

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:01.760
[laughter]
Thank you, John Andre.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.514
"And your music is
excellent,"

00:46:03.514 --> 00:46:04.010
he added.
 

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:06.719
[laughter] Thank you very much.
 

00:46:06.719 --> 00:46:09.396
He was supposedly taken aback
for a moment when he saw the

00:46:09.396 --> 00:46:11.978
gallows, because up until that
moment he really had been

00:46:11.978 --> 00:46:13.340
expecting a firing squad.
 

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.300
He asked if he had to die in
this manner.

00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.869
Told he would,
he replied in a loud voice,

00:46:17.869 --> 00:46:20.284
which was remembered later by
lots of people in their diaries

00:46:20.284 --> 00:46:22.532
and in letters,
"I am reconciled to my

00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:24.340
fate but not to the mode."
 

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:24.677
Right?
 

00:46:24.677 --> 00:46:27.380
So the audience was like:
'oh, this is moving.'

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.563
[laughter]
When asked if he had last words

00:46:29.563 --> 00:46:31.054
he said,
"I have nothing more to

00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:32.045
say,
gentleman"--boy,

00:46:32.045 --> 00:46:33.750
you better practice last words
in this age--

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.193
"I have nothing more to
say, gentleman,

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:39.432
but this: you all bear me
witness that I meet my fate as a

00:46:39.432 --> 00:46:40.570
brave man."
 

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.978
At this, the crowd began to
sob, [laughter]

00:46:42.978 --> 00:46:46.246
and then the trapdoor was
released and that was the end of

00:46:46.246 --> 00:46:47.449
Major John Andre.
 

00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:51.242
Now his death inspired
engravings, songs,

00:46:51.242 --> 00:46:54.559
poems, plays for years
afterward.

00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:57.061
To many Americans,
he remained a sort of ideal

00:46:57.061 --> 00:47:00.005
gentleman and officer,
this noble and sensitive youth,

00:47:00.005 --> 00:47:01.730
this sort of romantic hero.
 

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:04.688
He was beloved by young
American officers who thought he

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:07.106
was this superior,
genteel, sophisticated,

00:47:07.106 --> 00:47:10.237
cultured individual in a way
that they didn't necessarily

00:47:10.237 --> 00:47:11.860
consider themselves to be.
 

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:15.590
He somehow seemed better than
them, and to many this was

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:19.322
inextricably tied up with the
fact that he was a British

00:47:19.322 --> 00:47:21.900
gentleman, the best of that
breed.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.208
The extreme adoration of Andre
in America shows how Americans

00:47:25.208 --> 00:47:28.516
still suffered from a little bit
of an inferiority complex in

00:47:28.516 --> 00:47:31.329
relation to the British who
still represented--

00:47:31.329 --> 00:47:35.340
at least partly in their
mind--the height of culture and

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:36.579
sophistication.
 

00:47:36.579 --> 00:47:40.201
Even now, in a time of war,
they're responding to Andre in

00:47:40.201 --> 00:47:40.900
this way.
 

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.489
Peggy eventually joined her
husband in England,

00:47:43.489 --> 00:47:46.885
successfully playing her cards
as a woman throughout to protect

00:47:46.885 --> 00:47:49.842
herself from the hatred that
certainly was shown to her

00:47:49.842 --> 00:47:50.500
husband.
 

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.320
And Arnold of all of them was
really cursed forever,

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:56.690
eternally hated largely of
course because of his treason,

00:47:56.690 --> 00:47:58.730
his betrayal of the American
cause,

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:02.505
but partly in a sense also
because in some ways his actions

00:48:02.505 --> 00:48:05.630
were understandable to some
people in America.

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.186
He was someone who was
ambitious and tried to raise his

00:48:09.186 --> 00:48:09.780
status.
 

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:12.501
He was someone who spent too
much money, took too many risks

00:48:12.501 --> 00:48:13.469
to advance himself.
 

00:48:13.469 --> 00:48:16.557
He was someone who was seduced
by all that the British had to

00:48:16.557 --> 00:48:16.969
offer.
 

00:48:16.969 --> 00:48:19.911
In a sense, he was a kind of
everyman gone wrong,

00:48:19.911 --> 00:48:23.101
an example of the worst that
was possible in this new

00:48:23.101 --> 00:48:25.860
somewhat more egalitarian
American world.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.871
So part of the reason why
Americans hated Arnold with such

00:48:29.871 --> 00:48:33.811
passion is that partly they
understood that in some ways,

00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:35.219
Arnold was them.
 

00:48:35.219 --> 00:48:36.268
Wow. That was just in time.
 

00:48:36.268 --> 00:48:36.568
Okay.
 

00:48:36.568 --> 00:48:38.719
That is the end of today's
lecture.

00:48:38.719 --> 00:48:43.900
We move on in the coming weeks
to war,

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.021
to Washington,
to sort of looking at how

00:48:46.021 --> 00:48:48.469
things are playing out on the
battlefield,

00:48:48.469 --> 00:48:51.527
and then we will work our way
towards Articles of

00:48:51.527 --> 00:48:55.161
Confederation and an actual
Constitution by the end of the

00:48:55.161 --> 00:48:55.989
semester.
 

00:48:55.989 --> 00:48:56.750
We will make it there.
 

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:58.019
See you on Thursday.
 

00:48:58.019 --> 00:49:04.000

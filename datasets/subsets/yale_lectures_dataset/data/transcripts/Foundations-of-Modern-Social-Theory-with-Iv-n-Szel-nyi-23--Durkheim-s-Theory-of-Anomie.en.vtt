00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.698
Prof: Okay,
so today is about the notion of

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:05.350
anomie.
 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.160
And anomie seems to be a very
simple notion.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.714
Anomie means the state of
normlessness,

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:18.419
and therefore it's very easy to
interpret--it looks like it is

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.600
very easy to interpret anomie.
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.190
I will show that's far from the
case.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.355
In fact, Durkheim has a pretty
complex notion about

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:37.644
abnormalities in the transition
to a market economy,

00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:41.960
in the transition to modernity.
 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.074
But before I do so,
let me come back to the issue

00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:51.230
of the division of labor in
Durkheim.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:00.322
Though he stages the book with
the idea of collective

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:05.247
conscience,
and goes long lengths

00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:12.090
explaining why he's using law as
an indicator of collective

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.735
conscience--
and we discussed that at great

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.861
lengths--
when it comes to describing the

00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:22.817
crucial differences between
mechanical and organic

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:26.674
solidarity,
he doesn't make much out of it

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:27.379
really.
 

00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:28.840
&gt;
 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.000
What drives the analysis of
this distinction,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.680
right, pre-modern and modern
societies,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.191
to put it in other words--the
crucial criteria is actually the

00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.000
division of labor.
 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.019
What drives the story is the
division of labor.

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:51.986
So in this sense,
in fact, I think Durkheim can

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:58.140
be understood as being greatly
inspired by Adam Smith,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.099
right, who also saw evolution
of human societies,

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.109
as you'll recall,
as a gradual evolution of the

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.420
division of labor.
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.388
Durkheim just does not offer
such complex or sophisticated

00:02:12.388 --> 00:02:17.710
periodicization of societies,
like hunting/gathering,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.750
and animal husbandry,
and agricultural and commercial.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.324
He just makes this bipolar
distinction between mechanical

00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:28.470
and organic.
 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.008
But if you ask,
well yes there is a difference

00:02:32.008 --> 00:02:33.740
in the legal system.
 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.807
But what is fundamentally
different is the division of

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:38.269
labor.
 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:38.960
Right?
 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.672
Mechanical solidarity has
little division of labor,

00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:46.460
based on similarity of the
actors in the society.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.164
Organic solidarity has a great
deal of division of labor,

00:02:52.164 --> 00:02:57.258
and a great deal of
dissimilarity of the action.

00:02:57.258 --> 00:03:01.128
And this is puzzling,
because the question is,

00:03:01.128 --> 00:03:03.360
if it is such a high level of
division of labor,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.951
and such a great diversity,
where on earth solidarity will

00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:10.968
come from,
how we hang together?

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:15.670
So that's, I think--we should
appreciate how important the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.628
division of labor for Smith from
Durkheim was.

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:24.903
By the way, in some ways,
even the early Marx,

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:31.937
in The German Ideology,
also tried his periodicization

00:03:31.937 --> 00:03:36.860
of society with the division of
labor.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.900
So I think this is also the
influence of Adam Smith.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.691
So I think there is a clear
Adam Smith impact on the work of

00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:51.180
Durkheim, on the types of
solidarity.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.060
There is also another issue I
would like to mention.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.140
I pointed out how important,
right, Montesquieu was for

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.379
Durkheim.
 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.919
And it's obvious.
 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.090
He acknowledges his debt to
Montesquieu,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:19.480
starts the book with collective
conscience and the notion of--

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:26.014
and law as the best empirically
observable indicator of this

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:30.581
collective conscience comes,
of course, directly to

00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.250
Montesquieu.
 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.709
But there is another less
frequently noticed impact of

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:41.288
Montesquieu on Durkheim,
and that makes actually

00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:45.120
Durkheim a very interesting
author for us today.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.466
As I mentioned,
he primarily has an impact

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:52.709
today with his later work as the
cultural analyst.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:58.357
But in his early work,
he responded to another

00:04:58.357 --> 00:05:06.004
stimulating idea of Montesquieu,
and that is the interaction

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:11.310
between social system and the
environment,

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.829
and the ecological system.
 

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:18.637
I went at some lengths in the
lecture on Montesquieu to show

00:05:18.637 --> 00:05:23.406
how important it was,
and how unique Montesquieu's

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.750
contribution was--
how important it is for us

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.110
today, though he made it in a
very naÃ¯ve way.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:37.348
Durkheim actually has a much
more sophisticated and complex

00:05:37.348 --> 00:05:43.838
understanding of the
relationship between environment

00:05:43.838 --> 00:05:48.733
and society,
and the type of solidarity,

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:52.639
and the division of labor in
society.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.214
Unfortunately,
this is sort of a neglected

00:05:57.214 --> 00:05:59.670
element in Durkheim.
 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.093
Too bad because,
in fact, the problem of

00:06:03.093 --> 00:06:07.922
environment and studying
environment should be a central

00:06:07.922 --> 00:06:11.449
issue in economics,
political science,

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:13.660
sociology and anthropology.
 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.497
And it is not quite as central
as it should be,

00:06:17.497 --> 00:06:22.170
especially I think in political
science and sociology and

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.589
anthropology.
 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:27.077
The study of environment is too
narrowly focused on

00:06:27.077 --> 00:06:29.379
environmental social movements.
 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:33.821
Well Durkheim has a different
interesting take,

00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:38.649
which I think should inspire
social researchers;

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:41.276
be they economists,
political scientists,

00:06:41.276 --> 00:06:43.509
sociologists or
anthropologists.

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.860
What is it?
 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.074
Durkheim, in The Division of
Labor, has a core of an idea

00:06:51.074 --> 00:06:53.723
what one can call the ecosystem.
 

00:06:53.723 --> 00:06:54.470
Right?
 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.754
He sees an inter-relationship
between the physical

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:04.591
environment,
the size of population which

00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:07.120
lives in this physical
environment,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.387
the technology which is used in
this environment and the

00:07:12.387 --> 00:07:16.137
division of labor,
and the type of social

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:21.110
organization what we have,
what kind of social solidarity

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.028
you have.
 

00:07:22.028 --> 00:07:24.220
Let me just put this on the
blackboard.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.730
I think this is rarely noticed.
 

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.946
You will rarely hear in
Durkheim's lectures,

00:07:30.946 --> 00:07:35.209
or rarely read about this when
you read about Durkheim.

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:41.410
So the idea is that you have
the environment,

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:46.730
you have the population,
you have technology,

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.482
and you have social
organization,

00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:55.704
and these constitute a system,
right, which interacts with

00:07:55.704 --> 00:08:01.935
each other;
and what ought to be studied is

00:08:01.935 --> 00:08:05.899
really this whole system.
 

00:08:05.899 --> 00:08:11.413
And, of course,
technology has a lot to do with

00:08:11.413 --> 00:08:13.571
division of labor.
 

00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:14.649
Right?
 

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:18.680
And that's what can be called
the ecosystem.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.290
He doesn't call it this way,
but environmental researchers

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.759
would call it today as the
ecosystem.

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:28.214
And I think this is an
extremely productive way for

00:08:28.214 --> 00:08:32.638
social scientists to think about
the problems of the environment.

00:08:32.638 --> 00:08:33.330
Right?
 

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.570
And let me give you an example.
 

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.407
Why don't you think about
Southern California?

00:08:40.407 --> 00:08:41.090
Right?
 

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:46.792
Southern California,
before the Europeans appeared

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:50.749
on the scene,
right, was a very dry

00:08:50.749 --> 00:08:57.149
climate--suffered from the lack
of water resources.

00:08:57.149 --> 00:09:01.937
So the Los Angeles Basin
probably could accommodate a

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:05.899
livelihood for something like
20,000 people.

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:06.820
Right?
 

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.889
These 20,000 people,
right, lived in this very arid

00:09:11.889 --> 00:09:16.556
environment, used very
elementary technologies,

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:21.120
and had a very limited division
of labor.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.206
So the population size was
greatly affected with the

00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:27.850
technology and the environment.
 

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.054
And they had mechanical
solidarity.

00:09:31.054 --> 00:09:31.808
Right?
 

00:09:31.808 --> 00:09:34.990
That was the way how society
was organized.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:41.634
Now today we've figured out how
to solve the hydraulic problems

00:09:41.634 --> 00:09:46.779
for the Los Angeles Basin,
for the time being.

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:52.692
Don't hold your breath because
in no time we may have a major

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:53.580
crisis.
 

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.996
So in the same basin where
20,000 people lived,

00:09:56.996 --> 00:09:59.450
now twenty million people live.
 

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.730
But they live at a very high
level of technology,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.928
where we successfully pollute
the air,

00:10:06.928 --> 00:10:11.341
which is, right,
hard to breathe in downtown Los

00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:14.345
Angeles during a hot summer day.
 

00:10:14.345 --> 00:10:15.190
Right?
 

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.283
And we have,
of course, organic solidarity

00:10:19.283 --> 00:10:20.280
operating.
 

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.178
Right?
 

00:10:21.178 --> 00:10:26.133
And we managed to screw the
environment, thank you,

00:10:26.133 --> 00:10:27.620
quite nicely.
 

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:31.988
And we keep doing it,
in no time the LA Basin will be

00:10:31.988 --> 00:10:33.163
uninhabitable.
 

00:10:33.163 --> 00:10:33.918
Right?
 

00:10:33.918 --> 00:10:37.796
That's why I think it is
interesting to think about this

00:10:37.796 --> 00:10:41.320
Durkheimian idea of ecosystem,
how it interacts.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.629
As I said, it would offer you a
very rigorous,

00:10:44.629 --> 00:10:48.918
right, scientific framework to
study the interaction,

00:10:48.918 --> 00:10:51.320
right, between social
organization,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.509
the demographic problem,
the technological issues,

00:10:55.509 --> 00:11:01.043
right, and its relationship;
how we can live,

00:11:01.043 --> 00:11:03.750
if we can, peacefully with the
environment.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:08.576
Anyway, just a backdrop
because, to show again the

00:11:08.576 --> 00:11:13.600
centrality of the division of
labor for Durkheim.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:18.190
Now today I will talk about
anomie.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:24.148
And anomie is one of the
abnormal consequences of the

00:11:24.148 --> 00:11:26.440
division of labor.
 

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:34.096
And well this is one of the
troubling aspects of Durkheim's

00:11:34.096 --> 00:11:39.907
work--the whole idea of
abnormality or social

00:11:39.907 --> 00:11:42.019
pathologies.
 

00:11:42.019 --> 00:11:46.058
And he has been criticized
about this a great deal.

00:11:46.058 --> 00:11:51.519
How do we know what is
abnormal, and how on earth can

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:56.350
we tell what is the normal state
of society?

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:00.809
Pathology does assume,
right, that social researchers

00:12:00.809 --> 00:12:05.870
have some way how to judge what
is the healthy condition for

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.899
society.
 

00:12:06.899 --> 00:12:11.479
And this comes from Durkheim's
early functionalism,

00:12:11.479 --> 00:12:12.394
as I said.
 

00:12:12.394 --> 00:12:13.220
Right?
 

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.899
He was greatly influenced by
biology.

00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:19.158
He was not a biologist by any
means.

00:12:19.158 --> 00:12:23.421
But as I pointed out,
the whole metaphor of organic

00:12:23.421 --> 00:12:27.937
solidarity uses the human body,
right, as the example.

00:12:27.937 --> 00:12:28.788
Right?
 

00:12:28.788 --> 00:12:33.746
How in the human body diverse
organs depend on each other to

00:12:33.746 --> 00:12:35.678
reproduce each other.
 

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:40.559
And therefore the word
pathology is also borrowed from

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:42.308
medical sciences.
 

00:12:42.308 --> 00:12:46.678
Society will have pathological
features as well,

00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:50.149
and there are abnormalities in
society--

00:12:50.149 --> 00:12:55.503
and somehow believes that
social researchers will be able

00:12:55.503 --> 00:13:01.240
to establish what abnormality is
and what pathologies are.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.861
This is, I think,
troubling for most social

00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:08.904
scientists,
right, because we seem to have

00:13:08.904 --> 00:13:14.668
some commitment to at least
value neutral type of analysis,

00:13:14.668 --> 00:13:20.553
right, in which we do not label
necessarily phenomena out.

00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:21.379
Right?
 

00:13:21.379 --> 00:13:25.590
We know labeling theory;
you may have heard about it.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:30.669
You label something as criminal
or abnormal, simply because it's

00:13:30.669 --> 00:13:33.090
probably unusual in society.
 

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:38.863
But what was abnormal in one
society may become absolutely

00:13:38.863 --> 00:13:41.700
normal in another society.
 

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.913
So you have to be extremely
careful, right,

00:13:44.913 --> 00:13:48.048
with the notion of normal and
abnormal.

00:13:48.048 --> 00:13:54.048
Let's say being gay,
until fairly recently,

00:13:54.048 --> 00:13:58.500
was seen--I mean,
except antiquity,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:02.259
but for most human societies
and most cultures,

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:06.700
being gay is seen as a kind of
abnormal behavior.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.139
Today very few people will
think about this,

00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:13.658
at least in a country like the
United States,

00:14:13.658 --> 00:14:16.058
that somebody gay is abnormal.
 

00:14:16.058 --> 00:14:16.940
Right?
 

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:23.538
So what sexual behavior is
normal or abnormal depends on

00:14:23.538 --> 00:14:24.740
the times.
 

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.820
Right?
 

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:30.315
It's really not the job of the
social scientist to be able to

00:14:30.315 --> 00:14:34.660
decide what kind of sexual
behavior should be called normal

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.860
or abnormal.
 

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:41.260
The best we can do,
why on earth some people call

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:47.000
some sexual practices abnormal
and others normal?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.019
Why is there differences in a
society, accepting some kind of

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:54.697
sexual behaviors and not others?
 

00:14:54.697 --> 00:14:55.450
Right?
 

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.509
That is a question what social
scientists could study.

00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:06.732
Anyway, this is I think clearly
a problem for contemporary

00:15:06.732 --> 00:15:11.928
social scientists with
Durkheim's work.

00:15:11.928 --> 00:15:17.400
But anyway he did believe that
he is capable to show that some

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.808
abnormal developments do take
place.

00:15:20.808 --> 00:15:24.081
He was especially,
as I pointed already in last

00:15:24.081 --> 00:15:27.527
lecture out,
on the transition from

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:31.308
mechanical to organic
solidarity,

00:15:31.308 --> 00:15:37.149
and when that happened,
then pathologies could emerge.

00:15:37.149 --> 00:15:40.259
And again, put it into the
social context.

00:15:40.259 --> 00:15:46.720
Durkheim is writing in the
1890s and early 1900s.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.601
He's in Bordeaux,
and then he's moving to Paris,

00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:54.399
the city of the sin,
right, and he sees all the

00:15:54.399 --> 00:15:56.711
signs of social pathologies.
 

00:15:56.711 --> 00:15:57.620
Right?
 

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:03.370
Alcoholism and homelessness and
prostitution and theft and

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:09.120
crime, which was inexistent or
much rarer in rural France,

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.450
just a couple of decades ago.
 

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.389
So he's confronted,
right, with massive phenomena,

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:20.298
which is being seen as abnormal
or pathological,

00:16:20.298 --> 00:16:25.302
and he identifies them as the
results of the transition from

00:16:25.302 --> 00:16:28.269
mechanical to organic
solidarity.

00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:33.320
Well pathologies can have two
different roots.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:38.282
And what we normally understand
from Durkheim,

00:16:38.282 --> 00:16:44.788
that he identifies pathologies
from the absence of rules.

00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:47.590
That's what the term anomie
refers to.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:52.570
But interestingly enough--I
have the citations for you,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:56.202
and if you have read the text
carefully you found the

00:16:56.202 --> 00:17:00.450
citations as well--
he actually also does consider

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:05.920
that pathologies can also result
from the overregulation,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.710
right, of too forced division
of labor.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:14.009
I think it's very intriguing to
see this.

00:17:14.009 --> 00:17:18.621
Because we normally counterpose
Marx's theory of alienation and

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:23.232
Durkheim's theory of anomie as
Durkheim is complaining there is

00:17:23.232 --> 00:17:26.058
not enough regulation in
society,

00:17:26.058 --> 00:17:30.759
while Marx is arguing there is
too much regulation in society.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:35.948
And I will give you a number of
citations now from Durkheim

00:17:35.948 --> 00:17:41.315
which actually will show that
the difference between Marx and

00:17:41.315 --> 00:17:47.130
Weber is not such gigantic as we
initially may have thought,

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:48.950
or generally would assume.
 

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:54.530
Durkheim is quite sensitive to
some of the Marxian analysis,

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.598
even to the Marxian notion of
alienation.

00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:01.528
He doesn't use the term,
but he gets very close to it.

00:18:01.528 --> 00:18:09.749
So let me just move on further
and talk about pathologies which

00:18:09.749 --> 00:18:14.920
are coming from the absence of
rules.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.423
Well, and I will briefly say
this interesting idea that in

00:18:20.423 --> 00:18:25.930
fact division of labor can be
the source of solidarity.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.240
As I said, this is
counterintuitive.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.747
We did believe that solidarity
comes from relatively

00:18:32.747 --> 00:18:37.078
small-sized communities where
people are relatively similar,

00:18:37.078 --> 00:18:39.970
share the same values and the
same system,

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:44.310
same norms, and then they will
have solidaristic feelings

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.940
towards each other.
 

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.078
When people are very different,
they are competing on the

00:18:49.078 --> 00:18:52.371
marketplace,
they are strangers in the

00:18:52.371 --> 00:18:56.000
cities, they don't know each
other,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.858
they subscribe to different
values,

00:19:00.858 --> 00:19:04.772
or they even don't know what
values they should obey because

00:19:04.772 --> 00:19:06.098
they are confused.
 

00:19:06.098 --> 00:19:10.136
They just left the village and
ended in the big and sinful

00:19:10.136 --> 00:19:13.749
city, and they don't really
quite know can I do here

00:19:13.749 --> 00:19:14.670
anything?
 

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:18.079
Is there any control over me,
or none?

00:19:18.079 --> 00:19:20.400
It's all up to me what to do?
 

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.339
Even stealing is alright;
selling my body is alright.

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:26.920
I see other people who do that.
 

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.319
Why don't I do it?
 

00:19:28.319 --> 00:19:29.500
They are not being caught.
 

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.868
I probably will not be caught
either.

00:19:31.868 --> 00:19:36.374
So that is a kind of,
right, under these

00:19:36.374 --> 00:19:41.571
circumstances,
when there are no similarities,

00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:46.539
why on earth-- we will be
solidaristic?

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:48.380
We don't know other people.
 

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:52.422
And we have these stereotypes
that in urban industrial society

00:19:52.422 --> 00:19:54.012
we are not solidaristic.
 

00:19:54.012 --> 00:19:54.609
Right?
 

00:19:54.609 --> 00:19:58.019
There are the usual stereotypes.
 

00:19:58.019 --> 00:20:00.993
You say you go to New York
City, right, and there is

00:20:00.993 --> 00:20:04.318
somebody who is dying on the
streets, and other people are

00:20:04.318 --> 00:20:06.127
just stepping over that person.
 

00:20:06.127 --> 00:20:06.769
Right?
 

00:20:06.769 --> 00:20:07.630
Who cares?
 

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.282
You can die on the street and
there will be hundreds of

00:20:10.282 --> 00:20:12.150
passengers going by and let you
die.

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:14.328
It's actually not true. Right?
 

00:20:14.328 --> 00:20:22.078
If you ever have seen anybody
feeling ill in Times Square,

00:20:22.078 --> 00:20:24.769
there are usually a lot of
people who rush over,

00:20:24.769 --> 00:20:26.109
that say, "Are you all
right?",

00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:27.309
or this kind of stuff.
 

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:29.490
But anyway.
 

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.432
But you know the stereotype.
 

00:20:31.432 --> 00:20:31.920
Right?
 

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.490
It's a usual stereotype about
cities.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.253
Anyway, so it's puzzling why a
society which is so different,

00:20:39.253 --> 00:20:42.013
anonymous, and such a high
division of labor,

00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:43.519
can be solidaristic.
 

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:46.400
Then he defines various
pathologies.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.152
And interestingly,
pathology one sounds very

00:20:50.152 --> 00:20:52.769
similar, very close to Marx.
 

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:57.108
Well there is crisis in the
system, and there is increasing

00:20:57.108 --> 00:21:00.176
class conflict,
and this class conflict is

00:21:00.176 --> 00:21:01.450
pathological.
 

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.076
And the second one,
well--and again something which

00:21:06.076 --> 00:21:10.519
is not all that different from
old Karl Marx--

00:21:10.519 --> 00:21:13.990
division of labor can be too
excessive,

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.615
and too much division of labor
can lead to pathological

00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:19.900
consequences.
 

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.905
And finally his unique
contribution,

00:21:22.905 --> 00:21:27.287
that pathology can come from
the lack of regulation,

00:21:27.287 --> 00:21:30.380
and that's what he calls
anomie.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:36.627
Now let me work on this,
and also the concept of anomie

00:21:36.627 --> 00:21:38.480
a little more.
 

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.525
So here it is:
the division of labor as a

00:21:42.525 --> 00:21:44.648
source of solidarity.
 

00:21:44.648 --> 00:21:45.558
Right?
 

00:21:45.558 --> 00:21:49.871
He said, well normally the
division of labor produces

00:21:49.871 --> 00:21:51.529
social solidarity.
 

00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:59.948
Well but it can happen that
there are the opposite results.

00:21:59.948 --> 00:22:01.108
Right?
 

00:22:01.108 --> 00:22:04.165
So therefore,
he said, "When we know

00:22:04.165 --> 00:22:08.140
when division of labor creates
social solidarity,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:13.414
then we will be better equipped
to figure out when actually

00:22:13.414 --> 00:22:18.509
social solidarity has
pathological consequences."

00:22:18.509 --> 00:22:24.834
And as you can see from the
citation, he directly cites the

00:22:24.834 --> 00:22:26.688
medical metaphor.
 

00:22:26.688 --> 00:22:27.670
Right?
 

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:32.092
"Here, as elsewhere,
pathology is a precious

00:22:32.092 --> 00:22:35.038
ancillary to physiology."
 

00:22:35.038 --> 00:22:39.740
So you start with the
physiology of society.

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.493
You identify when it works
normally, and then you will be

00:22:44.493 --> 00:22:47.549
able to show when it is
pathological.

00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:48.400
Right?
 

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.558
That's the fundamental idea.
 

00:22:50.558 --> 00:22:52.906
And this is,
in a way, how he tries to get

00:22:52.906 --> 00:22:56.397
off the hook of the problem that
he's actually capable to tell

00:22:56.397 --> 00:22:57.828
what is pathological.
 

00:22:57.828 --> 00:23:03.521
All right, now the first
pathology is actually about

00:23:03.521 --> 00:23:05.420
class conflict.
 

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:11.445
He said, well--and I think Marx
would not have been particularly

00:23:11.445 --> 00:23:14.890
unhappy with this citation,
right?

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.088
"As labor becomes
increasingly divided,

00:23:18.088 --> 00:23:23.588
there are commercial crises,
there are bankruptcies,

00:23:23.588 --> 00:23:27.640
there is hostility between
labor and capital,

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.484
and then all these conflicts
become more frequent."

00:23:32.484 --> 00:23:33.190
Right?
 

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:37.676
"Well in traditional
societies, in mechanical

00:23:37.676 --> 00:23:41.707
solidarities,
well these class conflicts were

00:23:41.707 --> 00:23:44.180
rare and unusual."
 

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:49.279
Well today they are not all
that unusual.

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:52.387
And he uses the term working
class.

00:23:52.387 --> 00:23:53.118
Right?
 

00:23:53.118 --> 00:23:57.261
He said, "Part of the
working class do not really

00:23:57.261 --> 00:24:01.170
desire the status assigned to
them." Right?

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.528
Well not quite the theory of
exploitation,

00:24:04.528 --> 00:24:09.202
but certainly an expression
that too high level of division

00:24:09.202 --> 00:24:12.112
of labor,
in absence of other,

00:24:12.112 --> 00:24:15.608
can create intense class
conflict,

00:24:15.608 --> 00:24:19.477
which is a pathological
consequence of high division of

00:24:19.477 --> 00:24:20.048
labor.
 

00:24:20.048 --> 00:24:26.105
Then he goes on and he writes
about "excessive division

00:24:26.105 --> 00:24:27.848
of labor."
 

00:24:27.848 --> 00:24:34.288
Well he has not read the
Paris Manuscripts;

00:24:34.288 --> 00:24:39.054
which was not published,
of course, for fourteen more

00:24:39.054 --> 00:24:41.068
years after he died.
 

00:24:41.068 --> 00:24:44.348
But, yes, you have read the
Paris Manuscripts,

00:24:44.348 --> 00:24:47.250
and you can see these
interesting parallels.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.551
"The individual will
isolate himself in his own

00:24:51.551 --> 00:24:52.480
activity.
 

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.772
He will no longer be aware of
the collaborator who worked at

00:24:58.772 --> 00:25:01.759
his side on the same task.
 

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:08.541
He has even not longer any idea
at all what the common task

00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:10.529
consists."
 

00:25:10.529 --> 00:25:13.769
Well is not this miraculous?
 

00:25:13.769 --> 00:25:18.712
He could not have the faintest
idea that a work called the

00:25:18.712 --> 00:25:21.489
Paris Manuscripts exists.
 

00:25:21.489 --> 00:25:22.269
Right?
 

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:25.981
And here what is being
described is getting very,

00:25:25.981 --> 00:25:29.538
very close to the idea of
alienation, right?

00:25:29.538 --> 00:25:33.297
And in fact comes very close to
the Marxian notion of

00:25:33.297 --> 00:25:37.200
alienation--not the Hegelian
one, the Marian notion.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:41.230
Because he roots it into
excessive division of labor.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:45.163
Too much market,
right, too much competition,

00:25:45.163 --> 00:25:47.400
creates this situation.
 

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.430
So I think this is miraculous.
 

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:55.336
And very often these sentences
are kind of skipped over as a

00:25:55.336 --> 00:25:59.140
kind of throwaway line,
by Durkheim.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.150
It isn't.
 

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.064
It is very important to
identify what his unique

00:26:03.064 --> 00:26:04.180
contribution is.
 

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:09.770
And this is indeed the emphasis
that a pathology can occur out

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:14.721
of the lack of regulation,
and lack of regulation means

00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:15.730
anomie.
 

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:20.779
Well he said,
"Well it is not necessary

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:26.298
for social life to be without
struggle."

00:26:26.298 --> 00:26:30.269
Struggle in itself is not that
bad at all.

00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:35.506
"The role of organic
solidarity is not to abolish

00:26:35.506 --> 00:26:40.150
competition, but to moderate
it." Right?

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:48.365
Well I just want to remind you,
this in a way reminds us to

00:26:48.365 --> 00:26:51.200
Adam Smith, right?
 

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.933
His sympathetic theory of human
nature.

00:26:53.933 --> 00:26:54.509
Right?
 

00:26:54.509 --> 00:27:00.701
Well, unlimited competition is
not right.

00:27:00.701 --> 00:27:01.940
Right?
 

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.818
Unlimited egoistic behavior is
not right.

00:27:05.818 --> 00:27:09.700
We have to be sympathetic to
the other person.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.390
Right?
 

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:13.356
We are struggling for
recognition by others.

00:27:13.356 --> 00:27:13.910
Right?
 

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:19.335
That is the idea where there is
a similarity in Durkheim's and

00:27:19.335 --> 00:27:21.470
Adam Smith's analysis.
 

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:24.039
But then he continues.
 

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:28.696
"But in some cases",
and this is crucial,

00:27:28.696 --> 00:27:32.842
"the regulatory process
which moderates competition

00:27:32.842 --> 00:27:37.681
either does not exist at all,
or not related to the degree of

00:27:37.681 --> 00:27:41.019
development of the division of
labor."

00:27:41.019 --> 00:27:42.450
It is insufficient.
 

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.286
There are either no
regulations, or not enough

00:27:46.286 --> 00:27:47.480
regulations.
 

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.571
"If then division of labor
does not produce solidarity,

00:27:52.571 --> 00:27:57.060
it is because the relationship
between organs are not

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.269
regulated.
 

00:27:58.269 --> 00:28:01.451
And this is what I call
anomie."

00:28:01.451 --> 00:28:02.160
Right?
 

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.380
And again you see the social
context?

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:12.106
This is exactly coming from the
empirical reference point:

00:28:12.106 --> 00:28:18.236
Rural young people get on the
train and then get off the train

00:28:18.236 --> 00:28:22.707
in Gare Lazare,
Saint Lazare,

00:28:22.707 --> 00:28:27.190
and then they walk into the
street in wild Paris,

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:30.828
the sinful city of Paris,
and they are lost.

00:28:30.828 --> 00:28:35.538
Suddenly their value system,
what they were told back home

00:28:35.538 --> 00:28:37.603
in the village,
collapses.

00:28:37.603 --> 00:28:38.430
Right?
 

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:43.105
Back in the village they knew
exactly what they are supposed

00:28:43.105 --> 00:28:43.740
to do.
 

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:48.262
Everybody knew them,
and they also knew if they are

00:28:48.262 --> 00:28:52.061
breaking the laws,
right, of the community,

00:28:52.061 --> 00:28:55.500
they will be immediately
punished.

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.259
Because there will be gossip
spreading around,

00:28:57.259 --> 00:29:00.781
and get back to home,
and mom and dad will exactly

00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:03.730
hear what you have done on the
street,

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.529
what you were not supposed to
do.

00:29:05.529 --> 00:29:07.108
Now you are in Paris.
 

00:29:07.108 --> 00:29:10.970
Nobody has the faintest idea
who you are.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.644
And even you don't know what
other people expect from you.

00:29:14.644 --> 00:29:15.160
Right?
 

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.609
It looks like this is the realm
of freedom;

00:29:17.609 --> 00:29:20.058
you can do anything. Right?
 

00:29:20.058 --> 00:29:25.681
Well back home in the village,
if you were engaged you better

00:29:25.681 --> 00:29:30.553
do not hold hands with another
partner on the street.

00:29:30.553 --> 00:29:31.490
Right?
 

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:34.160
Because then the gossip will go
back to your fiancÃ©e,

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.152
and to her parents or his
parents, and your parents

00:29:37.152 --> 00:29:40.118
immediately,
and there will be a scandal.

00:29:40.118 --> 00:29:46.239
Well if you are walking on
Boul'Mich,

00:29:46.239 --> 00:29:49.368
you can do anything.
 

00:29:49.368 --> 00:29:51.109
You can hold the hand of
anybody.

00:29:51.109 --> 00:29:53.140
You can kiss anybody. Right?
 

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.579
Nobody knows who you are. Right?
 

00:29:55.579 --> 00:29:57.250
So that's it.
 

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.400
That is the problem, right?
 

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:03.914
Of anomie, that people enter in
a society in which they are

00:30:03.914 --> 00:30:04.460
lost.
 

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:11.568
Well let me just labor a little
longer on the idea.

00:30:11.568 --> 00:30:16.200
And here again see that even
the notion of anomie,

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.868
it's probably--I don't know
whether,

00:30:19.868 --> 00:30:24.519
how much he's making his
argument too complex,

00:30:24.519 --> 00:30:32.440
or Marx's idea of alienation
was too complex.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.877
But you can see here again some
similarities,

00:30:35.877 --> 00:30:40.490
even between anomie and the
Marxian notion of alienation.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:44.740
He said, "The division of
labor may reduce the worker to

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.440
the role of a machine.
 

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:52.020
He's not aware of where the
operations required of him are

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:57.309
leading, and he does not link
them to any aim."

00:30:57.309 --> 00:30:59.808
Whoa.
 

00:30:59.808 --> 00:31:02.690
"Every day he repeats the
same movements,

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:08.332
with monotonous regularity,
but without having any

00:31:08.332 --> 00:31:11.387
understanding--
interest in understanding of

00:31:11.387 --> 00:31:11.859
them."
 

00:31:11.859 --> 00:31:16.430
Well, how interesting. Right?
 

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.196
That's where,
in Durkheim's thinking,

00:31:20.196 --> 00:31:25.742
the lack of norms or values,
the collapse of the value

00:31:25.742 --> 00:31:28.150
system, leading to.
 

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:31.618
And for him--of course,
that's a big difference--

00:31:31.618 --> 00:31:35.318
the solution is to fix the
system of values,

00:31:35.318 --> 00:31:39.415
right, to fix the system of
norms, and then you solve the

00:31:39.415 --> 00:31:40.880
problem of anomie.
 

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.207
But he also said that,
"Look, anomie is not an

00:31:45.207 --> 00:31:49.794
inevitable consequence of the
division of labor."

00:31:49.794 --> 00:31:50.660
Right?
 

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:56.431
Well he has a conception that
division of labor can be forced,

00:31:56.431 --> 00:31:58.417
and can be excessive.
 

00:31:58.417 --> 00:31:59.269
Right?
 

00:31:59.269 --> 00:32:05.679
There must be elements in the
collective conscience which

00:32:05.679 --> 00:32:07.740
moderate, right?
 

00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:12.250
The competitive elements of the
division of labor.

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.799
But if those
institutions--cultural,

00:32:15.799 --> 00:32:19.959
legal, moral,
ethical institutions--are in

00:32:19.959 --> 00:32:25.740
place, then in fact the division
of labor will not produce

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:30.356
anomie;
it only will produce such if

00:32:30.356 --> 00:32:33.420
there is no such systems.
 

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.490
But then he said,
"Do not read me as a

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.818
romantic.
 

00:32:39.818 --> 00:32:43.486
I don't want to idealize the
village community,

00:32:43.486 --> 00:32:47.392
where these boys and girls,
in Gare Lazare,

00:32:47.392 --> 00:32:50.980
are coming out of the
train." Right?

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:54.848
"I don't want to send them
back to the rural village.

00:32:54.848 --> 00:32:58.594
I'm not advocating a return
from organic solidarity to

00:32:58.594 --> 00:33:00.288
mechanical solidarity.
 

00:33:00.288 --> 00:33:04.011
All what I am showing,
under what circumstances there

00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:08.450
are pathological consequences,
right, in organic solidarity.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:13.342
And therefore we have to find
the proper medication,

00:33:13.342 --> 00:33:18.520
the proper cocktail of drugs,
by which we can cure this

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.864
disease."
 

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:20.920
Right?
 

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.858
That is the key idea.
 

00:33:22.858 --> 00:33:30.088
Well now another very
interesting argument;

00:33:30.088 --> 00:33:36.038
which is usually neglected in
reading Durkheim.

00:33:36.038 --> 00:33:39.759
He said, "Look,
there are pathologies in

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:44.323
society which are coming from
overregulation and forced

00:33:44.323 --> 00:33:46.690
division of labor."
 

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:58.078
Well this is already in The
Division of Labor.

00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:01.568
But a crucial text is in fact
the so-called "Second

00:34:01.568 --> 00:34:05.058
Introduction into The
Division of Labor."

00:34:05.058 --> 00:34:10.445
Durkheim received a lot of
criticism of the First Edition

00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:15.157
of The Division of
Labor--was criticized of

00:34:15.157 --> 00:34:18.909
being too conservative
politically.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:23.775
And that's when he wrote the
"Second Introduction to

00:34:23.775 --> 00:34:26.989
The Division of
Labor."

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:32.489
And if you are interested at
all in Durkheim,

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:35.905
you have to read the
"Second Introduction"-

00:34:35.905 --> 00:34:39.780
the introduction to the Second
Edition of The Division of

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:40.699
Labor.
 

00:34:40.699 --> 00:34:44.630
Because here he tries to offer
some,

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:50.831
quote/unquote,
progressive solution to the

00:34:50.831 --> 00:34:57.539
problems of anomie,
and the nature of solidarity in

00:34:57.539 --> 00:35:04.735
organic societies--
how to overcome the problem of

00:35:04.735 --> 00:35:10.590
class conflicts in modern
society.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.860
And there his idea is that
really these solidarities--

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.867
this is the idea he develops in
the introduction to the Second

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:23.443
Edition--
that we are becoming

00:35:23.443 --> 00:35:28.389
solidaristic within our
professions.

00:35:28.389 --> 00:35:32.657
These are the professional
organizations in which we will

00:35:32.657 --> 00:35:35.630
find our identities and
solidarities.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:40.112
So he actually sees the good
society as evolving into a

00:35:40.112 --> 00:35:43.929
multiplicity of professional
organizations,

00:35:43.929 --> 00:35:47.800
in which people fit into these
professional environments,

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:51.336
and do have a strong
professional identity and

00:35:51.336 --> 00:35:55.110
solidaristic attitudes towards
the profession.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:59.610
This is, right,
a radically different idea,

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:03.219
right, from the--it's not
dealing with markets,

00:36:03.219 --> 00:36:07.574
not messing up with the
markets, or not messing up too

00:36:07.574 --> 00:36:11.349
much with the markets,
to put it this way. Right?

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:14.666
Professional organizations,
if they are effective,

00:36:14.666 --> 00:36:16.833
they do mess up with the
markets.

00:36:16.833 --> 00:36:17.510
Right?
 

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:21.119
American Medical Association
does mess up,

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:23.099
because it's a kind of trade
union,

00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:30.195
right, which makes sure that
the doctors' interests are being

00:36:30.195 --> 00:36:33.389
particularly represented.
 

00:36:33.389 --> 00:36:38.030
Anyway, this is the
"Second Introduction."

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:42.190
But what is interesting in this
citation is that he said,

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:48.358
"Well, pathology can
emerge actually from an

00:36:48.358 --> 00:36:54.737
excessive level of regulation,
or forced division of

00:36:54.737 --> 00:36:56.059
labor."
 

00:36:56.059 --> 00:37:01.081
And he introduces another
notion here, and this is

00:37:01.081 --> 00:37:02.210
fatalism.
 

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:09.059
So there are these two
different pathologies of modern

00:37:09.059 --> 00:37:10.610
societies.
 

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:16.106
One is emerging in the
transition from mechanical to

00:37:16.106 --> 00:37:21.280
organic solidarity,
given the absence of commonly

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.268
shared values,
and that's anomie.

00:37:25.268 --> 00:37:29.327
And there is another
possible--on the other end of

00:37:29.327 --> 00:37:33.219
the scale you have too excessive
regulation,

00:37:33.219 --> 00:37:36.280
and then people become
fatalistic because then they

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.666
think there is nothing what they
can do.

00:37:38.666 --> 00:37:39.280
Right?
 

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:43.619
Anomie is when you can say,
"Anything goes;

00:37:43.619 --> 00:37:45.956
I can get away with anything.
 

00:37:45.956 --> 00:37:46.518
Right?
 

00:37:46.518 --> 00:37:52.418
Or you are desperate,
because you don't know what on

00:37:52.418 --> 00:37:56.699
earth you want to do with
yourself.

00:37:56.699 --> 00:38:03.809
Fatalism is when you think well
I have no control over my life.

00:38:03.809 --> 00:38:06.000
I am over-regulated. Right?
 

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.030
And then you become fatalistic.
 

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.510
It doesn't matter.
 

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:14.440
Nothing matters because it's
overregulated.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.150
Okay.
 

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:28.556
Now let me just very briefly
compare these three ideas of

00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:34.760
Marx, Weber, and Durkheim.
 

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:40.436
Well I hope I did not confuse
you too much with some of the

00:38:40.436 --> 00:38:44.940
citations, which are quite
counterintuitive.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:49.619
But it's important to see the
sophistication of the analysis.

00:38:49.619 --> 00:38:53.550
The bottom line,
after all, is he said,

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.864
"Look, my unique
contribution to the study of

00:38:56.864 --> 00:39:00.719
pathologies of modern society is
the theory of anomie,

00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:05.059
which says that temporarily,
in this transition,

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:10.010
we have a problem of absence of
rules.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:14.163
This will be overcome,
because there is no reason why

00:39:14.163 --> 00:39:19.195
a properly moderated competition
and division of labor could not

00:39:19.195 --> 00:39:23.750
create actually very high levels
of solidarity."

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:27.789
And the mechanism,
he suggests in the "Second

00:39:27.789 --> 00:39:31.581
Introduction,"
is creation of professional

00:39:31.581 --> 00:39:35.704
organizations and slotting
people into professional

00:39:35.704 --> 00:39:37.929
communities, as such.
 

00:39:37.929 --> 00:39:40.059
They are not going back to the
villages,

00:39:40.059 --> 00:39:44.275
but they will be sort of
belonging to professional

00:39:44.275 --> 00:39:48.061
communities and having
solidaristic ideas and

00:39:48.061 --> 00:39:49.869
identities there.
 

00:39:49.869 --> 00:39:52.670
So this is kind of the bottom
line.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:57.650
He is sensitive to the problems
what Marx is talking about.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:01.351
He understands that yes,
modern society does create

00:40:01.351 --> 00:40:04.804
class conflicts,
and this is a problem because

00:40:04.804 --> 00:40:08.260
the working class very often
feels ill-treated--

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:13.876
doesn't use the term exploited,
but is unhappy with the

00:40:13.876 --> 00:40:16.579
position assigned to it.
 

00:40:16.579 --> 00:40:19.130
So he sees this is a problem.
 

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:24.268
He also sees the problem that
excessive division of labor may

00:40:24.268 --> 00:40:27.867
create a sense of--he doesn't
use the term,

00:40:27.867 --> 00:40:30.952
but really what he
means--alienation.

00:40:30.952 --> 00:40:31.980
Right?
 

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.887
And he also is quite aware that
too much regulation also can

00:40:36.887 --> 00:40:40.880
create a pathological state of
mind: fatalism.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.518
So but the major contribution
is, as I've said,

00:40:45.518 --> 00:40:50.260
anomie is insufficient
regulation in society.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:52.340
This is his unique contribution.
 

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.143
Well alienation,
as we have seen,

00:40:55.143 --> 00:40:59.000
is more like fatalism,
right, in Durkheim.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.760
It comes from too much
regulation.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:07.126
And then we have Weber's notion
of disenchantment,

00:41:07.126 --> 00:41:10.869
right, the loss of the
enchanted garden.

00:41:10.869 --> 00:41:15.936
This is all coming--the kind of
mood or feel,

00:41:15.936 --> 00:41:19.967
the human condition under
modernity.

00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:21.119
Right?
 

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.840
These are three different takes.
 

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:27.242
For Weber, it is the loss of
magic, right,

00:41:27.242 --> 00:41:33.579
and in a way the conversion of
the dance and all-sided human

00:41:33.579 --> 00:41:38.949
relationships into instrumental
relationships.

00:41:38.949 --> 00:41:47.889
I think I briefly mentioned in
the lecture on alienation,

00:41:47.889 --> 00:41:57.230
and probably also lecture on
Weber,

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:01.523
that this is actually very
similar to the ideas of Georg

00:42:01.523 --> 00:42:05.409
LukÃ¡cs,
who was a Marxist philosopher

00:42:05.409 --> 00:42:09.380
and who developed the theory of
reification.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.780
Weber is developing the theory
of disenchantment,

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.989
what is the problem of
modernity.

00:42:16.989 --> 00:42:20.099
That we lost the enchanted
garden--

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:22.829
that we are too rationalistic,
too cold,

00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:28.536
too instrumental--at a time
when LukÃ¡cs is shifting

00:42:28.536 --> 00:42:33.806
from Hegel to Marx,
and invents the idea of

00:42:33.806 --> 00:42:35.539
reification.
 

00:42:35.539 --> 00:42:39.849
And they happen to both live at
that time in Heidelberg,

00:42:39.849 --> 00:42:43.489
and Georg LukÃ¡cs,
who was a young man at that

00:42:43.489 --> 00:42:45.574
time,
in his twenties,

00:42:45.574 --> 00:42:49.550
was a frequent guest in the
Weber house,

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.530
in the salon run by Marianne
Weber.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:57.186
So there is clearly a mutual
influence on LukÃ¡cs'

00:42:57.186 --> 00:43:01.929
unique interpretation of Marx's
theory of alienation--

00:43:01.929 --> 00:43:05.539
that human relationships are
becoming reified--

00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:14.949
and Weber's notion of
instrumentalization of life,

00:43:14.949 --> 00:43:20.460
which is I think distinctly
different both from the theory

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.070
of anomie and alienation.
 

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:31.521
Okay, a final note on
Durkheim's theory of human

00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:36.219
nature;
what was his theory of human

00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:37.099
nature?
 

00:43:37.099 --> 00:43:50.797
And here we can see a sharp
distinction between Marx and

00:43:50.797 --> 00:43:52.789
Weber.
 

00:43:52.789 --> 00:43:56.791
Marx, mainly following
Rousseau's line,

00:43:56.791 --> 00:44:03.322
basically believed that--he did
not have the notion of state of

00:44:03.322 --> 00:44:07.927
nature any longer;
by the mid-nineteenth century

00:44:07.927 --> 00:44:10.768
people got tired and got rid of
it.

00:44:10.768 --> 00:44:16.510
But he used the term species
being--what is the essence,

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.179
human essence?
 

00:44:18.179 --> 00:44:25.420
Well he said essentially humans
are fine.

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:33.429
It is the society which is the
problem, not the individual.

00:44:33.429 --> 00:44:40.510
So this is exactly the
Rousseauian inspiration in Marx.

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.809
Society corrupts.
 

00:44:42.809 --> 00:44:45.938
In the state of nature we were
good--and Marx even adds--I

00:44:45.938 --> 00:44:49.286
think I already made this point,
but let me underline one more

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:49.780
time.
 

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:53.010
He goes beyond Rousseau.
 

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:58.204
Because Rousseau saw the noble
savage as a savage,

00:44:58.204 --> 00:45:03.929
as an individual who has to be
brought into society.

00:45:03.929 --> 00:45:07.300
At that point Marx disagrees
with Rousseau.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:12.960
He sees we were born in society;
we are social by nature. Right?

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.699
So we are not only good,
but we are also social.

00:45:16.699 --> 00:45:20.606
And it is society which
corrupts us, which creates us

00:45:20.606 --> 00:45:25.190
egoistic individuals who will
compete with each other and will

00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:26.393
kill each other.
 

00:45:26.393 --> 00:45:27.219
Right?
 

00:45:27.219 --> 00:45:31.382
This is exactly the opposite,
right, of Hobbes,

00:45:31.382 --> 00:45:35.634
and a big step beyond
Rousseau's theory of human

00:45:35.634 --> 00:45:36.630
nature.
 

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:43.286
Now Durkheim is actually much
closer to Hobbes in his notion

00:45:43.286 --> 00:45:47.538
of human nature,
because he believes,

00:45:47.538 --> 00:45:54.074
right, that social pathologies
emerge when there is a vacuum of

00:45:54.074 --> 00:45:56.500
control over people.
 

00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:01.702
That's when you have crime and
suicide and prostitution and

00:46:01.702 --> 00:46:02.690
whatever.
 

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:09.679
And therefore he had a
skeptical view of human nature.

00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:14.358
Unless we are controlled,
then we can be evil.

00:46:14.358 --> 00:46:15.190
Right?
 

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:18.246
That is the fundamental issue.
 

00:46:18.246 --> 00:46:18.960
Right?
 

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:26.838
What you have to fix is making
sure that individuals develop

00:46:26.838 --> 00:46:30.309
the proper value system.
 

00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:34.322
Thank you very much,
and have a wonderful

00:46:34.322 --> 00:46:36.630
Thanksgiving's break.
 

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:41.119
Yes, see you the last week of
the semester.

00:46:41.119 --> 00:46:46.000

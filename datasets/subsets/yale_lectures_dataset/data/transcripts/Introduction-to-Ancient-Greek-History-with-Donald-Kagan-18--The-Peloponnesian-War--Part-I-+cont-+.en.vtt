00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.536
Professor Donald
Kagan: The oaths

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:11.410
establishing the thirty-years
peace was sworn in the year 445.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.329
That leaves,
as we know, of course they

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:21.207
didn't about fourteen years
before the Great Peloponnesian

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:26.634
War will break out,
and although we only know a

00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:32.290
little bit about the events
between the two wars,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.535
what we do know,
I think, is interesting

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:40.611
although not easy to interpret
evidence about the character of

00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:44.090
that peace,
which we've been talking about.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.802
One way to determine whether
the peace was a true peace with

00:00:49.802 --> 00:00:54.934
a real chance of lasting and
controlling international

00:00:54.934 --> 00:01:00.123
affairs for a good long time,
or whether it was really a

00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:04.646
truce that merely interrupted a
conclusion to a war that was

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:08.025
inevitable,
I think that can be tested to

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:12.637
some degree by the events that
took place in those fourteen

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:15.523
years or so.
I think we can--one

00:01:15.523 --> 00:01:19.939
critical question of course is
quite apart from the objective

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.472
elements of the peace,
maybe more important than those

00:01:24.472 --> 00:01:29.769
are the intentions of the two
sides and I think it is possible

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:34.720
to arrive at some sense of what
those intentions were.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.640
There is little doubt that
Pericles still in the position

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.980
of the leading politician in
Athens,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.106
clearly the man who was,
I think, the negotiator for

00:01:49.106 --> 00:01:54.095
peace on the Athenian side.
If I'm right about his

00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:58.202
invention of the arbitration
clause that would suggest he was

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:02.377
very much personally involved in
shaping the character of that

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:05.909
peace.
It seems plain that he really

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.468
was sincerely committed to a
policy of preserving peace for

00:02:11.468 --> 00:02:16.259
the future, for as far as it
could possibly go.

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:22.280
One reason is that several
years before the peace--indeed

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.400
before this war had broken out,
the Athenians had made a peace

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.227
with the King of Persia.
The negotiator on the Athenian

00:02:33.227 --> 00:02:37.465
side was a man named Callias and
so it goes down in the books as

00:02:37.465 --> 00:02:41.351
the Peace of Callias.
This is about as debated a

00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:46.069
subject as there is in the
history of ancient Greece.

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.620
Was there really a Peace of
Callias or not?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.246
Was it a formal peace or not?
Even in ancient times,

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:59.930
some writers question whether
this was a historical fact.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.633
I won't trouble you with all
the arguments both ways,

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:07.692
but let me indicate--my own
opinion is that there actually

00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:11.504
was a formal peace.
But it doesn't matter whether

00:03:11.504 --> 00:03:15.030
that's true or false,
because nobody doubts that

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.379
there was a de facto
peace between the Athenians and

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.879
their allies on the one hand and
the Persians for a good long

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.315
time,
and that it is not broken until

00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:31.241
well into the Great
Peloponnesian War when in the

00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:36.229
year 412 there is a treaty made
between Sparta and Persia,

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.340
which brings Persia into the
war against the Athenians.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.805
So, there's this considerable
stretch of time when there is

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:48.640
peace with Persia.
Now, about the same

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.220
time--the traditional date for
Peace of Callias is 449,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.794
and about the same time,
we are told only by Plutarch,

00:03:57.794 --> 00:04:01.734
so some scholars have
questioned the historicity of

00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:05.055
this too,
that Pericles called for a

00:04:05.055 --> 00:04:10.810
great Pan Hellenic Congress to
discuss a variety of questions,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.614
but one of them was how shall
we keep the promises we made

00:04:15.614 --> 00:04:21.008
after the Persian War to rebuild
the temples to the gods that had

00:04:21.008 --> 00:04:24.970
been destroyed by the Persians
in that war,

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.779
and how shall we see to the
freedom of the seas?

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:36.957
Now, the question,
of course, the temples of the

00:04:36.957 --> 00:04:43.897
gods that had been destroyed in
the Persian War were essentially

00:04:43.897 --> 00:04:48.690
all in Attica.
So, here was an occasion where

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.216
the Athenians were apparently
hoping to bring all the Greeks

00:04:54.216 --> 00:04:59.462
into the picture to help pay the
costs of restoring those

00:04:59.462 --> 00:05:02.501
temples.
It was the Athenians,

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:07.273
who had benefited from it most,
but also maintaining the

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:12.218
freedom of the seas meant
providing for a fleet that would

00:05:12.218 --> 00:05:17.250
keep the Persians out and keep
pirates out and so on.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.709
The Athenians obviously had
that fleet.

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:24.369
The result of having--If the
Greeks had all in fact

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:29.588
participated in this activity it
would have been a way of

00:05:29.588 --> 00:05:35.366
legitimizing both the Athenian
Empire and of course a navy that

00:05:35.366 --> 00:05:38.852
made it great,
but also it would have

00:05:38.852 --> 00:05:42.910
legitimized the plan that
Pericles had in mind and which

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.336
we know he carried out to the
best of his ability immediately

00:05:47.336 --> 00:05:52.170
to rebuild those temples,
and indeed, to build some new

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.140
ones as well on the Acropolis
and elsewhere in Attica as

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.930
evidence of the greatness and
the glory of Athens.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.437
This building program was going
to be at the center of his

00:06:05.437 --> 00:06:08.944
domestic concerns for the rest
of the period we're talking

00:06:08.944 --> 00:06:12.180
about.
He invited all the Greeks,

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.634
but as it turned out,
the Spartans and their friends

00:06:16.634 --> 00:06:20.601
chose not to show up.
You can see why for the reasons

00:06:20.601 --> 00:06:24.041
that I in fact have just given
you as to why this would be

00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:27.461
attractive to Athens;
that's why it would not be

00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:30.449
attractive to Sparta.
There is some debate.

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.638
Did Pericles ever expect that
the Spartans would accept or was

00:06:35.638 --> 00:06:40.657
this just his way of making it
clear that since the Spartans

00:06:40.657 --> 00:06:45.846
and the other Greeks would not
participate in these activities

00:06:45.846 --> 00:06:50.440
Athens was right in going about
it unilaterally?

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.840
One of the things that it would
do, if the Athenians were now to

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.971
say well, when the Spartans
didn't show up and their allies

00:06:56.971 --> 00:07:00.318
didn't show up--and they said if
they won't keep their promises

00:07:00.318 --> 00:07:02.379
to the gods,
we will.

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:07.096
That provides justification for
building the first of the great

00:07:07.096 --> 00:07:10.899
temples he was going to put up
on the Acropolis,

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:14.210
the Parthenon,
which was going to be the great

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.079
marvel of the Greek world
thereafter,

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:21.710
and which was going to be very
expensive, and which he was

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.101
going to use league money for.
This would legitimize it,

00:07:26.101 --> 00:07:29.970
he hoped, and it would be an
argument for doing that.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:36.017
As for the claim that they
needed to preserve the freedom

00:07:36.017 --> 00:07:41.863
of the seas, that would give
legitimacy to the existence of

00:07:41.863 --> 00:07:46.786
the great fleet of the league,
which was paid for by league

00:07:46.786 --> 00:07:48.149
money.
In other words,

00:07:48.149 --> 00:07:51.379
it would give legitimacy to the
Athenian Empire.

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:54.860
No doubt he thought that was
necessary because having

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.077
made--that's why I like the idea
that he did make a formal peace

00:07:59.077 --> 00:08:01.722
with the Persians,
but in either case,

00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:05.177
with it being obvious that
there would be no more attacks

00:08:05.177 --> 00:08:08.817
on the Persians and that the
Persians were out and that they

00:08:08.817 --> 00:08:12.102
were not a threat anymore,
why should the allies

00:08:12.102 --> 00:08:15.238
contribute their ships and
money, and by the way,

00:08:15.238 --> 00:08:19.159
by this time most of them were
not contributing money and the

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:22.100
Athenians were manning all of
the fleet.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.519
Why should this continue if the
war with the Persians was over?

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:30.478
Pericles never imagined
that the Athenians would give up

00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:34.234
their fleet, their empire,
the tribute that supported all

00:08:34.234 --> 00:08:38.111
of that.
So, he needed to have a reason

00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:40.594
for doing that.
So, my view,

00:08:40.594 --> 00:08:44.749
and that of many other scholars
is that the Congress decree,

00:08:44.749 --> 00:08:48.340
as it is called,
certainly had that as a motive.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.760
Was he serious?
What would he have done if the

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.620
Spartans had said,
"sure we'll do that."

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.257
I think he expected that they
wouldn't, but he was prepared to

00:08:56.257 --> 00:08:59.240
have them do that,
because if they would they

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.028
would contribute the money
presumably that was necessary

00:09:03.028 --> 00:09:06.954
and they would also grant
legitimacy to what the Athenians

00:09:06.954 --> 00:09:09.639
were doing with their navy at
sea,

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:12.702
and, of course,
it would be a wonderful

00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:17.215
situation because it would
create a kind of unity between

00:09:17.215 --> 00:09:21.970
the two that would help keep war
away and Pericles' plan for

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.564
using all of that money from the
treasury for his building

00:09:26.564 --> 00:09:31.319
program required peace.If
the Athenians were going to be

00:09:31.319 --> 00:09:33.873
at war,
that money would not be

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.635
available.
So for all of these reasons he

00:09:36.635 --> 00:09:40.060
did what he did.
My guess is he anticipated the

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.403
likely outcome,
but it doesn't mean that he was

00:09:43.403 --> 00:09:47.109
unprepared to deal with the
situation if it had been

00:09:47.109 --> 00:09:50.876
otherwise.
There I think we see the first

00:09:50.876 --> 00:09:56.409
bit of evidence that leads to my
opinion that Pericles was very

00:09:56.409 --> 00:10:00.960
sincere about preserving the
thirty-years peace,

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.823
that he saw that and hoped it
would be the instrument by which

00:10:04.823 --> 00:10:08.179
there would be--who can talk
about perpetual peace,

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:12.990
but at least peace for the
foreseeable future.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.802
Another event,
a much debated one,

00:10:16.802 --> 00:10:23.500
that cast some light on what's
going on occurs in the year 443.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.238
In that year,
the Athenians agreed to help

00:10:28.238 --> 00:10:34.709
establish a colony in southern
Italy at a place that they

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:38.969
called Thurii.
Now, there are several things

00:10:38.969 --> 00:10:42.876
about this colony that are
interesting and perhaps as

00:10:42.876 --> 00:10:46.122
interesting as any,
is that it was different from

00:10:46.122 --> 00:10:49.306
any other colony we ever heard
of in the Greek world before

00:10:49.306 --> 00:10:51.984
this time.
You know the picture of what a

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:56.442
typical apoikia is like.
It is the colony of a city and

00:10:56.442 --> 00:11:00.931
that city is its mother city,
and you know all about those

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:04.227
relationships.
There were rare occasions where

00:11:04.227 --> 00:11:07.699
a couple of cities might get
together and jointly be the

00:11:07.699 --> 00:11:10.539
mother cities of the town,
but that's all.

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:17.674
This colony was established
from the first as a panhellenic

00:11:17.674 --> 00:11:19.977
colony.
In other words,

00:11:19.977 --> 00:11:24.963
it was not an Athenian colony
even though the Athenians took

00:11:24.963 --> 00:11:28.259
the lead in establishing the
colony,

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:32.555
even though the Athenians
appointed the critical players

00:11:32.555 --> 00:11:35.453
in establishing the colony.
The founder,

00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:37.250
the oikos was an
Athenian;

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.963
Pericles sent along the leading
seer, the leading religious

00:11:42.963 --> 00:11:48.873
figure in all of Athens to be
helpful in the founding of that

00:11:48.873 --> 00:11:52.236
city.
Herodotus, a good friend of

00:11:52.236 --> 00:11:57.923
Pericles, who also of course was
the father of history went out

00:11:57.923 --> 00:12:03.059
there presumably to be the
historian of the new city.

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:07.893
Hippodamus, the great city
planner of the fifth century

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:10.290
B.C.
who was famous--you might not

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.919
think this is such a big deal
but it is;

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:18.505
he applied simply right angled
streets in founding the new

00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:22.464
city, when of course,
all the old cities had been

00:12:22.464 --> 00:12:26.124
founded as I described Athens
itself with streets that just

00:12:26.124 --> 00:12:29.785
developed out of old cow paths
that just wound all over the

00:12:29.785 --> 00:12:32.970
place,
so the modern grid structure

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:37.541
was the work of Hippodamus.
All of these guys were

00:12:37.541 --> 00:12:41.624
friends and associates,
part of the brains trust you

00:12:41.624 --> 00:12:46.187
might say of Athens under
Pericles and these guys went out

00:12:46.187 --> 00:12:49.549
and established the colony of
Thurii;

00:12:49.549 --> 00:12:51.730
all of these elements are
interesting.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:13:00.885
Why a panhellenic colony?
Well, for one thing I should

00:13:00.885 --> 00:13:04.433
point out too,
that Pericles had seen to it

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:09.248
that the membership of the
colony consisted of people from

00:13:09.248 --> 00:13:13.767
a variety of places,
and it's interesting to point

00:13:13.767 --> 00:13:18.832
out that although the Athenians
had the greatest single number

00:13:18.832 --> 00:13:24.517
of people in this new colony,
when that colony's constitution

00:13:24.517 --> 00:13:29.889
was drawn up--I forgot what's
the name of the sophist.

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:35.620
Protagoras laid out the
constitution for this new city;

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.399
again, he was a friend of
Pericles.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:41.900
It was divided up into ten
tribes, just like Athens.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.755
It was a democracy.
The constitution was very much

00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:46.700
influenced by the Athenian
model.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:51.359
And as I said one of the ten
tribes, and remember the ten

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:55.934
tribes have to be equal in order
for them to present the

00:13:55.934 --> 00:14:00.138
necessary regiments in the army.
Only one tenth of the people

00:14:00.138 --> 00:14:01.951
were Athenians,
even though there were more

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:05.422
Athenians than anybody else,
but there were several tribes

00:14:05.422 --> 00:14:09.393
made up of Peloponnesians,
not from one particular city

00:14:09.393 --> 00:14:13.062
but all from the Peloponnesus.
I make those points,

00:14:13.062 --> 00:14:16.729
because I want to make it clear
that if you just look at the

00:14:16.729 --> 00:14:20.271
percentage of the population
occupied by Athenians it will

00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:22.820
not allow them to dominate the
city.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.430
This really is a panellenic
colony.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.136
Why?
My view is that Pericles was

00:14:31.136 --> 00:14:37.559
attempting to make a very
significant point here.

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:42.003
After all, this colony was
established in reaction to a

00:14:42.003 --> 00:14:45.129
request made by some Italian
Greeks,

00:14:45.129 --> 00:14:47.667
who were having trouble in
their own city,

00:14:47.667 --> 00:14:51.133
needed to found a new one,
needed more people in order to

00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:53.131
make it viable,
went to Sparta,

00:14:53.131 --> 00:14:56.255
the Spartans said we're not
interested, went to Athens and

00:14:56.255 --> 00:14:59.460
the Athenians said "yes,"
we'll help you do this.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.635
Now, the Athenians could have
said "no," or they could have

00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:07.380
done the normal thing if they
wanted to say "yes."

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.680
Make it an Athenian colony.
Why did they come up with this

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.440
brand new idea that nobody had
ever seen?

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.876
In my view it was because
Pericles was glad to have an

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:22.690
opportunity to demonstrate
something about Athens'

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.570
intentions now and in the
future.

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.262
That was the best way to
advertise the fact that the

00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:36.151
Athenians were not interested in
expanding their power out to the

00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:38.954
west,
because if they had been they

00:15:38.954 --> 00:15:41.610
would have made it an Athenian
colony.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.705
Other scholars have taken the
opposite view,

00:15:44.705 --> 00:15:48.879
and think it is the sign of
Athenian imperial interests,

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:51.344
which would have said
practically the day after the

00:15:51.344 --> 00:15:55.264
treaty was signed;
Pericles and the Athenians were

00:15:55.264 --> 00:16:01.227
already violating the spirit of
that treaty, but I think that is

00:16:01.227 --> 00:16:06.238
easily demonstrated to be wrong.
All we have to do--well,

00:16:06.238 --> 00:16:09.392
first of all what I've done
already is to look at the

00:16:09.392 --> 00:16:12.850
internal character of the state
and you want to argue,

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.586
that is not the way to start an
imperial venture in the west,

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:19.139
set up a colony that's not your
colony,

00:16:19.139 --> 00:16:23.429
and that has only got a tenth
of its population being

00:16:23.429 --> 00:16:28.710
Athenian, but other evidence I
think makes it all the clearer.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:33.575
Only a year after the
foundation of the city,

00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:38.440
it went to war against a
neighboring town,

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.444
the town of Taras,
which became the Roman town of

00:16:43.444 --> 00:16:49.486
Tarentum, modern Taranto.
Taras was one of the only

00:16:49.486 --> 00:16:54.841
Spartan colonies.
So, here you have a Spartan

00:16:54.841 --> 00:17:00.679
colony fighting against a
Thurii, whatever that is.

00:17:00.679 --> 00:17:04.885
Imagine for a moment though it
were an Athenian colony,

00:17:04.885 --> 00:17:08.000
as the people of a different
view say.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.010
What does Athens do?
I think that's really critical.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:20.670
The answer is nothing.
Taras defeats Thurii.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:27.420
Then to rub it in they take
some of the spoils of victory

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:33.809
and place them at Olympia where
the games are held,

00:17:33.809 --> 00:17:36.829
where all the Greeks can come
and see, in which they boast

00:17:36.829 --> 00:17:40.494
about their victory over Thurii.
What do the Athenians do

00:17:40.494 --> 00:17:43.150
about all this?
Nothing;

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.564
this is not the way to behave,
if you're planning to start an

00:17:47.564 --> 00:17:50.359
empire in Sicily and southern
Italy.

00:17:50.359 --> 00:17:53.980
So, I think that's a very
serious blow to the theory of

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.858
imperialism out there.
Then a few years down the road,

00:17:58.858 --> 00:18:04.973
we get to the year 434 - 433,
the crisis which will produce

00:18:04.973 --> 00:18:10.140
the Great Peloponnesian War has
already begun.

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:15.629
So, everybody is looking ahead
to the coming war between Athens

00:18:15.629 --> 00:18:18.219
and Sparta.
At that time,

00:18:18.219 --> 00:18:24.310
there is a big argument that
breaks out within Thurii.

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.992
Whose colony are we?
Once again, a terrific

00:18:27.992 --> 00:18:32.717
indication that nobody thinks
it's an Athenian colony right

00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:35.363
off the bat,
although in the argument,

00:18:35.363 --> 00:18:38.722
the Athenians claim well it's
an Athenian colony--I mean the

00:18:38.722 --> 00:18:41.238
Athenians in Thurii say,
we're an Athenian colony

00:18:41.238 --> 00:18:43.359
because there are more Athenians
than anybody else.

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:45.248
Whereupon,
the Peloponnesians say,

00:18:45.248 --> 00:18:48.259
yes there are more Athenians
than anybody else but there are

00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:50.759
more Peloponnesians than there
are Athenians.

00:18:50.759 --> 00:18:53.910
So, we are a Peloponnesian
colony, we are a Spartan colony.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:58.485
Well, they couldn't agree,
and so they came to the

00:18:58.485 --> 00:19:03.995
decision that they would allow
Apollo, through his oracle at

00:19:03.995 --> 00:19:07.584
Delphi, to decide.
Well, that's an interesting

00:19:07.584 --> 00:19:11.919
thing too.
Who does the oracle at Delphi

00:19:11.919 --> 00:19:15.244
lean towards?
We've had very clear evidence

00:19:15.244 --> 00:19:18.799
of it in the 440s.
They are pro-Spartan.

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:22.863
The Spartans have been the
defenders of the priests as

00:19:22.863 --> 00:19:25.930
against the Phocians from the
outside.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:30.662
There's every reason to believe
a decision made by the priest of

00:19:30.662 --> 00:19:35.319
Apollo will favor Sparta and
that's not what happens though.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:38.670
What the priest says,
you are not an Athenian colony,

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.422
you're not a Spartan colony,
you are my colony,

00:19:41.422 --> 00:19:44.509
says Apollo.
A very nice way out of the fix.

00:19:44.509 --> 00:19:47.819
But one thing they're not is an
Athenian colony.

00:19:47.819 --> 00:19:50.930
Now, what do those imperialist
Athenians do about it?

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:54.084
Nothing.
To my mind that absolutely

00:19:54.084 --> 00:19:57.972
undercuts any claim that
Athenian imperialism in the west

00:19:57.972 --> 00:20:00.609
explains what's going on out
there.

00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:04.220
But why--what's going on out
there altogether?

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.557
Why did he establish it at all?
Why did he establish it in the

00:20:07.557 --> 00:20:10.911
way that he did and why did he
react, or not react in the way

00:20:10.911 --> 00:20:14.683
that he did?
My suggestion for which there

00:20:14.683 --> 00:20:21.157
is no ancient direct evidence is
it was meant specifically to use

00:20:21.157 --> 00:20:26.619
current modern terms,
this was a diplomatic signal.

00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:31.490
Pericles wanted the rest of
the world, and most especially,

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.497
the Spartans and their
Peloponnesians allies to know

00:20:35.497 --> 00:20:39.582
that Athens did not have
ambitions of expanding their

00:20:39.582 --> 00:20:42.960
empire onto the mainland or out
west.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.436
I think what was understood by
the thirty-years peace is the

00:20:47.436 --> 00:20:51.609
Athenian Empire as it exists in
the Aegean and its front

00:20:51.609 --> 00:20:56.009
boundaries and to the east in
the direction of Persia,

00:20:56.009 --> 00:21:01.141
that's the Athenian sphere of
influence, again to use a modern

00:21:01.141 --> 00:21:04.043
term.
Everything to the west of

00:21:04.043 --> 00:21:08.829
that the Athenians are going to
say out of and leave alone.

00:21:08.829 --> 00:21:14.567
My view is, Pericles delivered
that message in his behavior

00:21:14.567 --> 00:21:18.920
concerning Thurii and he would
have known,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.857
I believe, that the number one
state who would be concerned

00:21:23.857 --> 00:21:28.369
about what was happening out
west would be Corinth,

00:21:28.369 --> 00:21:33.267
because the Corinthian chain of
colonies and the Corinthian

00:21:33.267 --> 00:21:36.730
major area of commerce was in
the west;

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:42.423
Italy, Sicily and such.
So, it was the Corinthians I

00:21:42.423 --> 00:21:45.852
think to whom he meant to send
this message,

00:21:45.852 --> 00:21:49.840
and in a little while we'll how
that works out,

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.646
whether it worked or it did not.
But it seems to me that is the

00:21:54.646 --> 00:21:57.333
only way to understand these
events that I have been putting

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:59.082
together,
but having said that,

00:21:59.082 --> 00:22:02.002
I remind you that other
scholars don't understand it

00:22:02.002 --> 00:22:02.690
that way.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:10.559
This takes us to the year
440, when another critical event

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:11.990
tests the peace.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:20.450
The Island of Samos has been an
oligarchic regime.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.690
It has been one of the biggest
states in the empire;

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.830
it has been autonomous,
that is to say it has its own

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.587
fleet, its own government,
which is again oligarchic not

00:22:32.587 --> 00:22:35.747
democratic, the way most of the
states are when the Athenians

00:22:35.747 --> 00:22:39.951
conquer them.
In that state there is as

00:22:39.951 --> 00:22:43.139
rebellion.
It comes about because of a

00:22:43.139 --> 00:22:46.621
quarrel between the Samians,
an island I remind you very

00:22:46.621 --> 00:22:48.900
close to the coast of Asia
Minor,

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.667
and the town of Miletus,
that famous city of

00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:57.881
philosophers,
which is just across from

00:22:57.881 --> 00:23:01.052
Samos,
and in between the two on the

00:23:01.052 --> 00:23:05.250
mainland is a very small town
called Priene and each town,

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:09.259
each one of these states claims
Priene.

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:13.511
So, it's a classic quarrel
between Greek poleis

00:23:13.511 --> 00:23:16.559
about territory that's between
them.

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:19.567
Now, this presents a very
special problem for the

00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:21.650
Athenians when you think about
it.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.111
On the one hand,
the Athenians hardly want to

00:23:25.111 --> 00:23:29.516
get into a fight with Samos,
an island of great power and

00:23:29.516 --> 00:23:34.314
importance with whom they have
been associated for a very long

00:23:34.314 --> 00:23:36.797
time.
On the other hand,

00:23:36.797 --> 00:23:42.186
how can the hegemonal power of
an alliance allow the big fish

00:23:42.186 --> 00:23:45.960
in the alliance to eat the
little fish,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.859
which is what would be
happening here?

00:23:48.859 --> 00:23:54.149
That is unacceptable if you're
going to have a proper hegemonal

00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:59.152
relationship with these folks.
So, the Athenians try to sort

00:23:59.152 --> 00:24:02.599
of split the difference as best
they could;

00:24:02.599 --> 00:24:08.382
they offered to serve as
arbitrators in this dispute and

00:24:08.382 --> 00:24:13.720
thereby to avoid war.
Samos would not hear of it.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.701
The Samians of course expected
to beat Miletus and they would

00:24:17.701 --> 00:24:21.000
have done that.
They were in the process of

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.260
doing what they were doing,
asserting true autonomy as

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.279
against the Athenian version of
it in the past,

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:31.980
but the Athenians couldn't
permit that.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.097
It's, again,
one of these confrontations in

00:24:35.097 --> 00:24:38.079
which each side,
from its own perspective,

00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:42.750
has right on its side but these
two concepts of right are

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.420
inevitably in conflict and
problems occur.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.757
Well, the Athenians win.
They are told that the Samians

00:24:51.757 --> 00:24:54.951
are turning down the arbitrators
and they're fighting against the

00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:57.906
Milesians.
Pericles immediately puts a

00:24:57.906 --> 00:25:02.690
fleet together and sails across
the sea and puts down the

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:06.585
rebellion by force,
and then he takes the steps

00:25:06.585 --> 00:25:10.019
that the Athenians have
typically taken against

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:13.230
rebellious states over the last
decades.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:17.544
That is, he establishes a
democracy, put an end to the

00:25:17.544 --> 00:25:21.255
previous regime.
He takes hostages from the

00:25:21.255 --> 00:25:26.091
rebellious aristocrats or
oligarchs and settles them on a

00:25:26.091 --> 00:25:31.099
nearby island to be sure that
these people will behave.

00:25:31.099 --> 00:25:35.720
Other than that,
he imposes on them an easy

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.423
settlement.
He does not do any great--does

00:25:39.423 --> 00:25:43.440
not do any harm to anybody,
doesn't execute anybody,

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:48.197
doesn't take away people's
land, doesn't exile all kinds of

00:25:48.197 --> 00:25:52.380
folks, he doesn't do that and so
his expectation,

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.120
and I guess his hope,
would have been that that would

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.763
be that.
From now on Samos would be a

00:25:58.763 --> 00:26:02.540
democracy, and therefore
reliable and friendly and there

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:07.046
would be no further trouble.
The hostages would help make

00:26:07.046 --> 00:26:10.680
that secure.
But the defeated oligarchs

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:16.258
did not accept defeat.
They went to the Persian satrap

00:26:16.258 --> 00:26:21.187
inland from Ionia,
his name was Pissuthnes,

00:26:21.187 --> 00:26:26.000
and asked for his help and he
gave it.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.640
He sent a force and the first
they did was to go to the island

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:33.640
where the hostages were kept,
take those hostages back and

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:38.479
return them to their friends and
families, and thereby took away

00:26:38.479 --> 00:26:42.857
this restraint against further
trouble and now the Samians

00:26:42.857 --> 00:26:47.389
overthrew the democratic regime
that had just been placed in

00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:51.230
power and started an oligarchic
revolution.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:56.267
Now, that's very serious right
away but more serious than that

00:26:56.267 --> 00:26:59.569
is on the news that this had
happened,

00:26:59.569 --> 00:27:04.003
the city of Byzantium,
which became Constantinople,

00:27:04.003 --> 00:27:08.703
which became Istanbul,
located at this vital strategic

00:27:08.703 --> 00:27:12.720
place on the Bostras,
also rebelled.

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:17.794
We are told later on in
Thucydides that at some time,

00:27:17.794 --> 00:27:22.471
and he doesn't date it,
the island of Mitilini,

00:27:22.471 --> 00:27:28.027
another one of these big
independent, important states

00:27:28.027 --> 00:27:31.603
with a navy,
also was thinking about

00:27:31.603 --> 00:27:36.917
rebellion, and I go along with
those scholars who suggest this

00:27:36.917 --> 00:27:41.359
is the time when they were doing
their thinking.

00:27:41.359 --> 00:27:47.160
So, Athens is suddenly
confronted by a danger that they

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:52.185
have really not faced before.
On the one hand,

00:27:52.185 --> 00:27:58.334
their empire may be in general
rebellion soon if this thing

00:27:58.334 --> 00:28:01.863
spreads.
Secondly, the Persians have

00:28:01.863 --> 00:28:07.115
actually taken an aggressive
step against the Athenian Empire

00:28:07.115 --> 00:28:11.930
by assisting the Samians in
their rebellion.Now,

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:14.699
we don't know,
and the Athenians couldn't

00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:18.576
know, whether Pissuthnes had
acted in accordance with the

00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:22.540
instructions of the great king,
or at least the wishes of the

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:25.089
great king, or he was just
running an independent

00:28:25.089 --> 00:28:27.670
operation.
The first would be a very,

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.398
very serious problem indeed.
It would mean a major threat

00:28:31.398 --> 00:28:33.538
from Persia;
the second would still be

00:28:33.538 --> 00:28:36.616
moderately serious.
I think we can't be sure

00:28:36.616 --> 00:28:41.450
because there was no time for
Pissuthnes to consult the king

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:44.400
and everything is happening
bang,

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.838
bang, bang and it takes months
to get a message back to Susa

00:28:48.838 --> 00:28:52.722
where the great king lives.
So, in the first instance

00:28:52.722 --> 00:28:55.650
Pissuthnes is certainly acting
on his own.

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.634
The question is,
does he really know how the

00:28:58.634 --> 00:29:02.920
king will react or not.
We can only guess about that.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.557
But here we go;
there are two parts of the

00:29:07.557 --> 00:29:13.509
trinity that will mean disaster
for Athens.

00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:16.978
If we look ahead to the
Peloponnesian War and examine

00:29:16.978 --> 00:29:21.380
what was it that defeated Athens
and put an end to their empire,

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.325
it was the combination of
rebellion in the empire,

00:29:25.325 --> 00:29:29.109
assistance to the rebellions by
the Persians,

00:29:29.109 --> 00:29:34.407
and the third critical step of
course, was that the Spartans

00:29:34.407 --> 00:29:37.640
were also in the war and ready
to,

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.354
and in fact they did,
invade Attica and fight against

00:29:42.354 --> 00:29:47.974
the Athenians on land and it's
that third critical element that

00:29:47.974 --> 00:29:51.420
is decisive right now here in
440.

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:57.173
The Spartans call a meeting
of the Peloponnesian League to

00:29:57.173 --> 00:30:02.927
discuss the question of should
we make war on the Athenians at

00:30:02.927 --> 00:30:08.210
this time and that would consist
of invading Attica,

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:12.119
and had they done so we would
have had, as I say,

00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:16.599
what was necessary to defeat
Athens in the Great War.

00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:20.707
Now, we know later on,
when the final crisis in 432

00:30:20.707 --> 00:30:25.718
and 431,433 actually is when the
speech I'm referring to takes

00:30:25.718 --> 00:30:28.696
place,
a critical part of the story of

00:30:28.696 --> 00:30:32.730
bringing on that war was the
attitude of the Corinthians.

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.988
As we shall see,
the Corinthians starting in 433

00:30:36.988 --> 00:30:40.160
at least began agitating for
war,

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:42.204
and their agitation,
I will argue,

00:30:42.204 --> 00:30:45.860
played a critical role in
bringing the Spartans to fight.

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:49.696
What do they do now?
On that occasion,

00:30:49.696 --> 00:30:53.359
when they were on the brink of
war, the Corinthians went to

00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:57.021
Athens and tried to argue the
Athenians out of taking steps

00:30:57.021 --> 00:31:00.748
that the Corinthians thought
would push the war into reality

00:31:00.748 --> 00:31:04.642
and they said this,
"When the Samians revolted from

00:31:04.642 --> 00:31:09.147
you and the other Peloponnesians
were divided in their votes on

00:31:09.147 --> 00:31:14.896
the question of aiding them,
we on our part did not vote

00:31:14.896 --> 00:31:18.138
against you.
On the contrary,

00:31:18.138 --> 00:31:23.692
we openly maintain that each
one should discipline his own

00:31:23.692 --> 00:31:30.349
allies without interference."
Now, that's critical.

00:31:30.349 --> 00:31:34.810
What they're saying is there
would have been an agreement to

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:38.770
go and attack Athens;
"we stopped it," was their

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:41.595
assertion.
Now, that statement cannot

00:31:41.595 --> 00:31:44.739
be a simple outright lie,
because the Athenians and

00:31:44.739 --> 00:31:48.259
everybody else in the Greek
world by now would have known

00:31:48.259 --> 00:31:53.103
what happened in that meeting.
Possibly, they're exaggerating

00:31:53.103 --> 00:31:58.654
their role, but what they cannot
be doing is misrepresenting the

00:31:58.654 --> 00:32:03.059
position they took against the
war with Sparta.

00:32:03.059 --> 00:32:06.202
My question is,
why were the Corinthians,

00:32:06.202 --> 00:32:10.286
who were so annoyed by the
Athenians--remember it was

00:32:10.286 --> 00:32:14.843
their--the Athenian alliance
with Megara against Corinth in

00:32:14.843 --> 00:32:18.106
about 461,
460 that started the first

00:32:18.106 --> 00:32:21.580
Peloponnesian War,
and as Thucydides tells us,

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.748
was the source of the hatred of
the Corinthians for the

00:32:25.748 --> 00:32:28.990
Athenians and yet here we are in
440,

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.519
and they are making a critical
position against the war.

00:32:33.519 --> 00:32:38.500
My answer to that question is
Thurii.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:42.016
I believe that when
Pericles and the Athenians sent

00:32:42.016 --> 00:32:45.901
that diplomatic message,
the Corinthians received it,

00:32:45.901 --> 00:32:50.519
thought they understood it,
and it changed their policies.

00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:54.839
So long as the Athenians stayed
out of their bailiwick,

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:58.279
they were prepared to preserve
the peace,

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:03.089
so I think that's a very
important story if you agree

00:33:03.089 --> 00:33:07.779
with that analogy.
Peace was very rigorously

00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:12.094
tested in 440,
and peace won out over a

00:33:12.094 --> 00:33:16.410
tremendous temptation to go to
war.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:20.883
That leads me to believe that
peace was possible,

00:33:20.883 --> 00:33:26.474
and I would argue still further
that having passed this great

00:33:26.474 --> 00:33:29.623
crisis,
having passed this test,

00:33:29.623 --> 00:33:34.933
chances of peace were better
than ever, because the two sides

00:33:34.933 --> 00:33:38.650
had acquired reason to trust the
other,

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:43.369
to behave by the rules as they
had been established.

00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:46.405
There is one small point
but--which turns out not to be

00:33:46.405 --> 00:33:48.289
so small, which I'll come back
to,

00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:53.157
which is the Corinthians'
interpretation of precisely what

00:33:53.157 --> 00:33:56.982
that peace meant,
I think will turn out to be not

00:33:56.982 --> 00:34:00.960
exactly what the Athenians
thought that it meant and that

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.009
would be serious when we get
down to the final crisis.

00:34:05.009 --> 00:34:09.755
By in 440, my assertion is,
the Samian rebellion

00:34:09.755 --> 00:34:14.500
demonstrates that war is still
not necessary.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:18.545
What has been established in
the minds of both sides,

00:34:18.545 --> 00:34:21.190
this I think is perfectly
clear,

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:26.382
is what we would call in the
modern world a balance of power

00:34:26.382 --> 00:34:31.840
in which the two sides recognize
the other really as equals,

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:37.340
where each has established a
sphere of influence out of which

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:42.199
the other is to stay and that
this is satisfactory.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:46.420
The issue about the
Spartans and the argument about

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.250
their behavior at this time
comes down to this.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:55.941
One scholar wants to emphasize
the fact that the Spartans even

00:34:55.941 --> 00:35:00.699
thought about going to war
against the Athenians,

00:35:00.699 --> 00:35:03.297
and if that hadn't been true
there never would have been a

00:35:03.297 --> 00:35:05.030
meeting of the Peloponnesian
League;

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.784
that's true.
He takes their decision to call

00:35:08.784 --> 00:35:12.671
the league as evidence that they
had decided to go to war,

00:35:12.671 --> 00:35:16.900
and were talked out of by the
Corinthians and their allies;

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:20.268
that's not the way I see it.
I think that the Spartans in

00:35:20.268 --> 00:35:22.952
440 were in the same position
they were in,

00:35:22.952 --> 00:35:26.210
or I will argue they were in at
the beginning of the

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:30.840
Peloponnesian War,
divided, uncertain.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.296
The more aggressive
Spartans were tempted by the

00:35:35.296 --> 00:35:39.489
terrific opportunity the Samian
War presented.

00:35:39.489 --> 00:35:43.623
The more conservative and
traditional Spartans were

00:35:43.623 --> 00:35:48.500
reluctant to start another big
war against the Athenians,

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:53.449
and the hawks had enough power
to compel them to consult their

00:35:53.449 --> 00:35:58.318
allies, but how their allies
reacted was going to be decisive

00:35:58.318 --> 00:36:03.268
and so I think that--my reading
of it is that the conservative

00:36:03.268 --> 00:36:07.893
Spartans were normally the
majority of the Spartans and it

00:36:07.893 --> 00:36:11.869
took a very special set of
circumstances,

00:36:11.869 --> 00:36:17.429
a special set of conditions to
move the Spartans to war and the

00:36:17.429 --> 00:36:22.630
Corinthians saw to it that that
was not going to happen.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:25.880
Be warned, all of this is a
matter of interpretation.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.891
There is no certainty about it
and Thucydides himself,

00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:33.070
who I think and most people
would agree,

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:37.480
thinks that the war was going
to come anyway regardless.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.885
He doesn't express opinions
about these actions that I'm

00:36:40.885 --> 00:36:44.599
talking about as to whether they
did or did not influence the

00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:47.601
course of events,
but we have that evidence and

00:36:47.601 --> 00:36:49.829
we have to use it and think
about it.

00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:54.815
My conclusion then,
is after the Athenians are now

00:36:54.815 --> 00:37:00.460
free to put down the rebellions
at Samos and at Byzantium,

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.789
to restore their empire,
and they will use the remaining

00:37:04.789 --> 00:37:09.749
years before the final crisis to
strengthen their control of the

00:37:09.749 --> 00:37:13.449
Aegean Sea and of their empire
in the east.

00:37:13.449 --> 00:37:18.513
Again, some scholars who think
the war inevitable will say this

00:37:18.513 --> 00:37:23.169
strengthening of the empire was
in fact itself a growth of

00:37:23.169 --> 00:37:28.314
Athenian power and that seems to
me to be a great stretch of the

00:37:28.314 --> 00:37:32.637
understanding of that word.
What it is is a

00:37:32.637 --> 00:37:35.977
consolidation of what they
already have,

00:37:35.977 --> 00:37:40.944
and there's no evidence that
these actions that I'm talking

00:37:40.944 --> 00:37:44.969
about frighten the Spartans or
upset them,

00:37:44.969 --> 00:37:47.841
and that's worth a lot,
because we hear plenty of

00:37:47.841 --> 00:37:51.251
complaints about what the
Athenians are doing in the final

00:37:51.251 --> 00:37:54.358
crisis,
but nobody makes any reference

00:37:54.358 --> 00:37:58.683
to these events that some
scholars think show Athenian

00:37:58.683 --> 00:38:02.489
growth.
So, there we are;

00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:05.780
again, a crisis has been
overcome.

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.804
My argument is,
no reason in the world why the

00:38:09.804 --> 00:38:15.080
two sides should fight each
other in the absence of some new

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.389
thing that changes
circumstances.

00:38:18.389 --> 00:38:22.719
That brings us down precisely
to the final crisis.

00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:25.059
So, I've been telling you the
war is not inevitable.

00:38:25.059 --> 00:38:29.205
So, now I have to tell you why
did it happen and that's what

00:38:29.205 --> 00:38:33.416
I'll try to do.
It starts where Thucydides

00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:39.349
of course surely begins the
story, having told you the story

00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:43.170
of how Athens came to be an
empire,

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.884
how Athens and Sparta came to
divide Greece between them in

00:38:46.884 --> 00:38:49.829
that first portion of his
history in Book I.

00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:54.125
We get to what I think is
chapter 24 in the first book

00:38:54.125 --> 00:38:58.420
where he suddenly moves to where
the crisis begins.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.307
Where does it begin?
It begins in a town called

00:39:02.307 --> 00:39:07.610
Epidamnus, which is located on
the western shore of the Greek

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.350
peninsula on the Ionian Sea.

00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:25.920
In Roman times it was called
Dyrrachium.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.324
It was an important road system
that they had,

00:39:29.324 --> 00:39:33.712
but in Greek times it was out
nowhere is what I'm trying to

00:39:33.712 --> 00:39:37.158
suggest to you.
It was not even on the way to

00:39:37.158 --> 00:39:38.890
anything very important.

00:39:42.019 --> 00:39:47.671
I always am reminded of the
term that Neville Chamberlain

00:39:47.671 --> 00:39:52.662
used when suddenly war
threatened about a place in the

00:39:52.662 --> 00:39:57.654
middle of Europe called
Czechoslovakia and Chamberlain

00:39:57.654 --> 00:40:03.400
said about it a faraway place of
which we know nothing.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:08.304
I would have been embarrassed
to say that even in 1937,

00:40:08.304 --> 00:40:12.300
but it's really something about
Epidamnus,

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.840
I mean it's way out there in
the middle of nowhere as far as

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.036
the Greeks are concerned.
Nothing is important about

00:40:20.036 --> 00:40:23.530
Epidamnus itself.
This is one of the many

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:27.471
occasions in which great wars
start in places that are

00:40:27.471 --> 00:40:31.932
inherently insignificant but
certain aspects of the situation

00:40:31.932 --> 00:40:35.489
make them significant.
In this case,

00:40:35.489 --> 00:40:42.641
the most important aspect was
that Epidamnus had been founded

00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:46.568
by Corcyra,
the modern island of Corfu,

00:40:46.568 --> 00:40:50.500
located not too far to the
south of Epidamnus.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:54.509
By the way,
I should have told you that the

00:40:54.509 --> 00:40:59.389
town of ancient Epidamnus today
is in Albania and I can't

00:40:59.389 --> 00:41:03.027
pronounce.
I don't know how Albanians

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:07.771
pronounce things but my best
attempt is Durrės,

00:41:07.771 --> 00:41:14.099
but I'm not sure that's right.
Anyway, the Corcyrians

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:20.323
established the colony there
centuries ago,

00:41:20.323 --> 00:41:27.139
but Corcyra was a colony itself
of Corinth,

00:41:27.139 --> 00:41:31.186
but as I told you earlier in
the semester it was a very

00:41:31.186 --> 00:41:34.386
unusual colony.
Its relations with the mother

00:41:34.386 --> 00:41:38.096
city were most unusual.
Thucydides reports that the

00:41:38.096 --> 00:41:42.486
first trireme battle in all of
history was fought between

00:41:42.486 --> 00:41:46.797
Corinth and Corcyra in the
seventh century and there are

00:41:46.797 --> 00:41:51.266
repeated wars between Corinth
and Corcyra just about one a

00:41:51.266 --> 00:41:54.480
century sometimes more
frequently,

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.707
and it's very clear that by the
time we are into the 430s,

00:41:59.707 --> 00:42:04.842
these two cities hate each
other and they hate each other

00:42:04.842 --> 00:42:11.170
with a traditional hatred handed
on down from century to century.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:16.168
This is a very critical
part of comprehending what takes

00:42:16.168 --> 00:42:19.764
place here.
Anyway, sometime maybe around

00:42:19.764 --> 00:42:24.754
436, a civil war breaks out
within the city of Epidamnus in

00:42:24.754 --> 00:42:28.969
what is not unusual by now in
the Greek world.

00:42:28.969 --> 00:42:35.434
It's about democrats versus
oligarchs and one side has

00:42:35.434 --> 00:42:41.410
control of the city,
the other side is driven into

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:44.755
exile.
The exiles get help from the

00:42:44.755 --> 00:42:47.487
barbarian tribes in the
neighborhood,

00:42:47.487 --> 00:42:51.965
because we're really talking
about the frontier of the Greek

00:42:51.965 --> 00:42:54.264
world.
They are not surrounded by

00:42:54.264 --> 00:42:56.779
fellow Greeks;
they are surrounded by

00:42:56.779 --> 00:43:01.554
non-Greeks.
So, there they are when the

00:43:01.554 --> 00:43:08.853
people, who are besieged,
send a delegation to their

00:43:08.853 --> 00:43:13.629
mother city,
Corcyra, asking for help from

00:43:13.629 --> 00:43:19.160
Corcyra in bringing peace to the
city and in putting an end to

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:23.150
the siege which they are
experiencing in.

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:27.790
Well, the Corcyraeans are not
interested;

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.389
their answer is "no."
We don't want to help you.

00:43:30.389 --> 00:43:33.870
There's no evidence they care
about which side wins;

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:41.730
they see no point in getting
involved themselves.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:45.878
An important part of the
story of Corcyra and its

00:43:45.878 --> 00:43:50.584
significance in the coming of
the war is that it was neutral

00:43:50.584 --> 00:43:53.707
towards everybody.
It was not a part of the

00:43:53.707 --> 00:43:57.044
Peloponnesian confederation.
It was not part of the Athenian

00:43:57.044 --> 00:43:59.869
League, and it wasn't associated
with anybody else.

00:43:59.869 --> 00:44:04.509
In fact, it had a reputation if
you can believe the Corinthians

00:44:04.509 --> 00:44:08.849
of being terribly uppity and
unassociating with anybody.

00:44:08.849 --> 00:44:12.735
I guess if you asked a
Corcyrian he might have used

00:44:12.735 --> 00:44:17.398
Lord Salsbury's term for Great
Britain late in the nineteenth

00:44:17.398 --> 00:44:20.739
century as enjoying splendid
isolation.

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:24.344
It wasn't too many years before
Lord Salisbury and others

00:44:24.344 --> 00:44:28.271
realized that isolation wasn't
so splendid as they thought and

00:44:28.271 --> 00:44:31.128
so it was with Corcyra.
But for the moment the

00:44:31.128 --> 00:44:34.228
Corcyraeans are saying who the
hell cares who wins your stupid

00:44:34.228 --> 00:44:37.989
civil war, take a walk.
So, they did.

00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:40.040
Well, I should say they took a
boat ride.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:45.427
They went to Corinth.
Now, this demonstrates an

00:44:45.427 --> 00:44:49.320
incredibly important principle
of human behavior.

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.743
What do you do if you go to
mother and you ask her,

00:44:52.743 --> 00:44:55.139
"can I have the keys to the
car,"

00:44:55.139 --> 00:44:59.689
or whatever it is you need and
she says, "no,

00:44:59.689 --> 00:45:05.170
you go to grandma," you know
what grandma will say,

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:08.045
right?
You know the old story about

00:45:08.045 --> 00:45:09.986
the grandmother.
Somebody rushes up,

00:45:09.986 --> 00:45:13.630
tells the grandmother,
"your grandson has just taken a

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:18.030
neighbor's child and thrown him
out of a third-floor window."

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.670
Grandmother says,
"bless him, such strong hands."

00:45:24.530 --> 00:45:32.639
So, the Corinthians react as
grandmother might;

00:45:32.639 --> 00:45:39.131
that is to say,
they agree to send help to the

00:45:39.131 --> 00:45:46.300
besieged Epidamnians.
They also agree to send an army;

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.380
first they'd end a fleet,
then they'll send an army which

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:53.217
will go there as well,
and they also are willing to

00:45:53.217 --> 00:45:56.813
re-colonize the city,
because, of course,

00:45:56.813 --> 00:46:00.860
the city is now divided between
two sides.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:04.025
So, if the people inside are
going to win the war ultimately

00:46:04.025 --> 00:46:06.010
they're going to need new
citizens;

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:08.143
they're not going to want to
take back those people trying to

00:46:08.143 --> 00:46:11.139
kill them.
So, the Corinthians organize a

00:46:11.139 --> 00:46:14.367
new colony to join them.
In other words,

00:46:14.367 --> 00:46:18.719
they give them every kind of
help that anybody can imagine.

00:46:18.719 --> 00:46:22.223
Now, if we look for a
reason why the Corinthians

00:46:22.223 --> 00:46:26.414
should have been willing to make
this enormous contribution to

00:46:26.414 --> 00:46:30.355
this far away argument,
scholars have had a field day

00:46:30.355 --> 00:46:34.670
for centuries trying to figure
out what the tangible benefits

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:39.087
are with absolutely no luck.
There is no evidence that is

00:46:39.087 --> 00:46:43.775
persuasive at all that there are
economic benefits to Corinth

00:46:43.775 --> 00:46:48.495
that are significant,
if they somehow have control,

00:46:48.495 --> 00:46:54.285
no matter what style control,
of Epidamnus and so I think we

00:46:54.285 --> 00:46:58.251
are driven back,
as we should have been driven

00:46:58.251 --> 00:47:01.874
in the first place,
to Thucydides' explanation whom

00:47:01.874 --> 00:47:05.859
himself asks the question and
answers it about the whole

00:47:05.859 --> 00:47:08.829
quarrel between Corinth and
Corcyra.

00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:14.608
He refers simply to the hatred
that the Corinthians felt

00:47:14.608 --> 00:47:18.752
towards the Corcyraeans.
When you get to that passage

00:47:18.752 --> 00:47:21.425
take a good look at it,
because Thucydides understands

00:47:21.425 --> 00:47:24.300
that we're all going to raise
our eyebrows a bit and so he

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.699
tells us the tale.
Why is that so?

00:47:26.699 --> 00:47:29.562
He says,
because every year the

00:47:29.562 --> 00:47:34.446
Corinthian hold a religious
festival in their city to which

00:47:34.446 --> 00:47:37.730
all of their allies send
delegates.

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:41.555
This is very normal and all the
other delegates treat them as

00:47:41.555 --> 00:47:44.579
you should treat a mother city,
with deference,

00:47:44.579 --> 00:47:46.297
with respect,
with gratitude,

00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:49.380
with kindness.
What do the Corcyraeans do?

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:54.045
They abuse them publicly,
they call them names,

00:47:54.045 --> 00:47:59.521
they treat them like dirt,
they insult them in front of

00:47:59.521 --> 00:48:05.388
the family so to speak.
Therefore, the Corinthians hate

00:48:05.388 --> 00:48:11.040
them, and out of this furious
dislike, that is what their

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.568
actions are about.
This has made scholars in the

00:48:14.568 --> 00:48:18.155
modern world very nervous.
They understand that there are

00:48:18.155 --> 00:48:22.099
only two things that make people
fight one another.

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:26.190
One of--yeah that's pretty much
what they used to say now that I

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:30.086
think of it, and many of them
still do in the face of what we

00:48:30.086 --> 00:48:33.123
see in the world today.
One is money,

00:48:33.123 --> 00:48:37.048
that is economic gain,
and we can thank Marx for that

00:48:37.048 --> 00:48:41.728
and for a whole century or more
people couldn't understand that

00:48:41.728 --> 00:48:45.804
people would ever do anything
for any reason except for

00:48:45.804 --> 00:48:49.545
monetary gain.
There isn't anything in this to

00:48:49.545 --> 00:48:51.460
explain it;
it just won't do.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.588
Scholars have failed in
attempting to show how that

00:48:54.588 --> 00:48:57.650
might be true.
The other has to do with power.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.546
Relationships,
if you this state on your side

00:49:01.546 --> 00:49:06.239
it will give the balance of
power to you and so on,

00:49:06.239 --> 00:49:09.747
but the truth of the matter is
Epidamnus is essentially

00:49:09.747 --> 00:49:13.515
irrelevant to the ordinary
struggles of power between these

00:49:13.515 --> 00:49:18.119
two states,
Corinth and Corcyra.

00:49:18.119 --> 00:49:21.289
Corcyra won't be poorer,
it won't be weaker if the

00:49:21.289 --> 00:49:24.718
Corinthians have Epidamnus nor
is there some kind of a

00:49:24.718 --> 00:49:28.534
tremendous strategic edge if you
can launch your attack from

00:49:28.534 --> 00:49:31.639
Epidamnus rather than from
someplace else.

00:49:31.639 --> 00:49:35.550
No, no, there's no reason to
doubt Thucydides about this.

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:40.230
This is about honor and it's
about dishonor.

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.840
Now, does that sound very
remote?

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.126
Who cares about honor in the
twentieth century,

00:49:45.126 --> 00:49:48.760
twenty-first century?
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:51.676
I will tell you that you and
everybody around you,

00:49:51.676 --> 00:49:55.127
and everything you see in the
world today is motivated more

00:49:55.127 --> 00:49:59.102
frequently--especially conflict,
but other things too,

00:49:59.102 --> 00:50:03.204
the way you lead your life is
influenced more by

00:50:03.204 --> 00:50:07.480
considerations of honor than of
anything else.

00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:11.710
Let me put it in the way that's
most helpful in this context.

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.719
It's really the negative that's
important.

00:50:13.719 --> 00:50:17.020
More important than honor is
dishonor;

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:23.504
people hate to be dishonored.
They hate--there is a wonderful

00:50:23.504 --> 00:50:26.780
slang word that now tells the
story.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.809
It wasn't available when I was
a kid.

00:50:28.809 --> 00:50:31.610
The thing was available,
but the word wasn't available.

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:38.090
If I say to you, he dissed me;
do you know what I mean?

00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:42.039
Do you think there's a danger
to your teeth if you dissed the

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:45.281
wrong guy?
Do you doubt that that sort of

00:50:45.281 --> 00:50:49.039
thing motivates individual
people constantly?

00:50:49.039 --> 00:50:52.527
I can show you,
and I've already shown the

00:50:52.527 --> 00:50:56.480
world that it motivates nations
constantly today,

00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:00.124
not only twenty years ago or
500 years ago,

00:51:00.124 --> 00:51:03.260
2000 years ago;
that's what Thucydides is

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.806
showing us here.
This is a very important

00:51:05.806 --> 00:51:08.517
permanent truth.
This is why Thucydides is so

00:51:08.517 --> 00:51:11.383
superior to modern political
scientists studying

00:51:11.383 --> 00:51:15.784
international relations.
They don't understand these

00:51:15.784 --> 00:51:20.697
things and Thucydides did.
So, that I think is what is

00:51:20.697 --> 00:51:25.571
happening and when it becomes
clear to Corcyra that Corinth is

00:51:25.571 --> 00:51:28.508
involved,
that they are looking for a

00:51:28.508 --> 00:51:32.391
fight, and that they have
dishonored Corcyra by taking

00:51:32.391 --> 00:51:36.329
over one of their colonies,
the Corcyraeans are on the one

00:51:36.329 --> 00:51:38.763
hand angered,
but on the other hand they're

00:51:38.763 --> 00:51:42.010
frightened because Corinth is a
great powerful state,

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:46.320
and more important than that,
Corinth is one of the most

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:50.410
significant allies of Sparta.
If the Corinthians are

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:54.435
giving us grief the Corcyraeans
could think this is a prelude to

00:51:54.435 --> 00:51:58.268
having the Peloponnesian League
come after us and that is not

00:51:58.268 --> 00:52:03.653
something you want to happen.
So, the Corcyrians ask for a

00:52:03.653 --> 00:52:10.079
conference with the Corinthians,
and they come and say,

00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:12.787
let us find a way to make peace
over this issue,

00:52:12.787 --> 00:52:15.150
let's see how we can negotiate
a peace.

00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:18.620
Corinthians are adamant.
They say you want peace;

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:24.314
this is what you got to do.
You have got to withdraw your

00:52:24.314 --> 00:52:29.998
forces from the city;
here you are besieging the

00:52:29.998 --> 00:52:35.750
city, because the Corcyraeans
have come with their fleet,

00:52:35.750 --> 00:52:40.139
they have defeated--I always
get this so backwards,

00:52:40.139 --> 00:52:43.300
let me see if I've got this
right.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:44.550
What are the Corcyrians doing?

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.730
Their armies are in the field
and their navy is at sea against

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:07.670
the opposition to the folks who
are inside the city,

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:11.310
and so the Corinthians say,
you were fighting these people

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:14.824
and you're asking us to talk
peace while you're fighting

00:53:14.824 --> 00:53:17.952
these people,
you withdraw your people and

00:53:17.952 --> 00:53:20.720
then we'll talk peace.
Well, of course,

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.282
that would give the advantage
to the other side,

00:53:23.282 --> 00:53:25.190
and the Corcyraeans said no
way,

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.685
and said tell you what we'll
withdraw our people,

00:53:28.685 --> 00:53:33.659
if you withdraw your people.
Corinthians said no way.

00:53:33.659 --> 00:53:37.489
I think what comes out of this
back and forth is important;

00:53:37.489 --> 00:53:43.422
it is that the Corcyraeans are
not looking to expand this

00:53:43.422 --> 00:53:45.550
fight;
they want to end it.

00:53:45.550 --> 00:53:48.564
Not because they are peaceful
and loveable fellows,

00:53:48.564 --> 00:53:52.000
but because they're afraid of
where this thing will go.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.979
We are now dealing with another
term that came into fruition in

00:53:55.979 --> 00:53:59.466
the twentieth century;
escalation is what these guys

00:53:59.466 --> 00:54:02.064
were afraid of.
We got this little fight going

00:54:02.064 --> 00:54:05.114
on here but next thing you know
we may find the Peloponnesian

00:54:05.114 --> 00:54:07.929
League involved.
But the Corinthians clearly

00:54:07.929 --> 00:54:11.901
aren't worried about that and
that's going to be a point we

00:54:11.901 --> 00:54:13.340
have to cope with.

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:27.311
The Corcyraeans say,
look if you don't work this out

00:54:27.311 --> 00:54:33.694
with us now, we may have to seek
allies, other allies besides

00:54:33.694 --> 00:54:37.665
those we already have.
Well, Thucydides has told us

00:54:37.665 --> 00:54:39.130
they don't have any other
allies.

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:43.330
But who are these allies that
they're going to seek?

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:49.590
That's a real question;
somebody tell me.

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.072
Athens, of course,
I wanted you to tell me,

00:54:52.072 --> 00:54:54.909
because I want to emphasize how
obvious it is.

00:54:54.909 --> 00:54:57.010
Nobody could have missed the
signal.

00:54:57.010 --> 00:55:00.495
This is a threat.
We know you Corinthians are

00:55:00.495 --> 00:55:03.588
playing as tough as you are
because you're counting on the

00:55:03.588 --> 00:55:06.529
Spartans to assist you.
Well, if you do,

00:55:06.529 --> 00:55:11.500
we will ask the Athenians to
help us and then what.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.760
And so the situation goes
forward.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:19.374
The Corinthians are not
bluffed, if it was really a

00:55:19.374 --> 00:55:24.834
bluff and on they go.
I should point out that at this

00:55:24.834 --> 00:55:31.709
meeting, the Corcyraeans said
they were willing to submit this

00:55:31.709 --> 00:55:35.743
quarrel to arbitration.
I remind you again,

00:55:35.743 --> 00:55:38.066
not mediation,
to turn it over to a third

00:55:38.066 --> 00:55:41.492
party and have them settle the
question, but the Corinthians

00:55:41.492 --> 00:55:44.988
turned that down.
I think that alone indicates

00:55:44.988 --> 00:55:49.030
who wanted war and who wanted
peace at this point.

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:55.495
The other thing is that it
should be remembered that the

00:55:55.495 --> 00:56:02.314
thirty-years peace provided that
neutrals were free to join

00:56:02.314 --> 00:56:08.780
either side that had signed the
thirty-years peace.

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:12.777
So that, when they were
implying and threatening an

00:56:12.777 --> 00:56:16.375
alliance with Athens,
they understood that the

00:56:16.375 --> 00:56:21.091
Athenians were free to accept
them into the alliance without

00:56:21.091 --> 00:56:26.231
breaking the thirty-years peace.
That would be a considerable

00:56:26.231 --> 00:56:29.460
issue as the problem grows more
difficult.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:34.622
Well, there is no peace and
so the two sides organized their

00:56:34.622 --> 00:56:37.100
navies.
The Corinthians did not have a

00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.581
large standing navy in peace
time and they set to work to put

00:56:40.581 --> 00:56:44.795
one together.
In 435 there is the Battle of

00:56:44.795 --> 00:56:51.252
Leucimne which takes place
between the Corinthians and the

00:56:51.252 --> 00:56:55.670
Corcyraeans and the Corcyraeans
win.

00:56:55.670 --> 00:57:01.889
Corinth is not deterred;
now they really go to work and

00:57:01.889 --> 00:57:07.207
they build for them a vast
fleet, consisting of ninety

00:57:07.207 --> 00:57:10.538
ships,
unprecedented outside of Athens

00:57:10.538 --> 00:57:13.672
and they do turn,
not in an official way,

00:57:13.672 --> 00:57:18.138
but unofficially to their
Peloponnesian allies asking them

00:57:18.138 --> 00:57:22.604
to contribute help too and their
Peloponnesian allies send

00:57:22.604 --> 00:57:27.098
another sixty ships,
and so the Corinthians have

00:57:27.098 --> 00:57:31.150
available a total of one hundred
fifty ships.

00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:38.210
The Corcyrian fleet consisted
of one hundred and twenty ships;

00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:42.841
they did have a fleet that they
kept at all times and that had

00:57:42.841 --> 00:57:47.016
given them the confidence in
advance to do what they had

00:57:47.016 --> 00:57:50.624
done,
but here was Corinth suddenly

00:57:50.624 --> 00:57:55.492
outnumbering them in this way.
Corcyra was now thoroughly

00:57:55.492 --> 00:57:57.914
frightened.
They knew that Corinthians

00:57:57.914 --> 00:58:01.895
would be coming after them again
with a fleet that was bigger

00:58:01.895 --> 00:58:05.809
than theirs, so they went to
Athens in September of 433.

00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:11.381
Now, I ask you again to imagine
yourself sitting there on the

00:58:11.381 --> 00:58:15.499
Pynx in Athens,
in September of 433 as the

00:58:15.499 --> 00:58:20.090
Corcyraean ambassadors have come
to your town.

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:23.697
They're going to ask you to
join in an alliance with them

00:58:23.697 --> 00:58:27.820
for the purpose of fighting the
Corinthians and their friends.

00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:31.485
The Corinthians who have heard
about this sent ambassadors of

00:58:31.485 --> 00:58:34.741
their own to Athens,
they are present on that same

00:58:34.741 --> 00:58:38.563
hill, and they will make their
case as to why the Athenians

00:58:38.563 --> 00:58:43.994
should say "no" to that request.
Thucydides reports his version

00:58:43.994 --> 00:58:47.936
of both speeches.
There is every reason to think

00:58:47.936 --> 00:58:52.001
he was sitting there in the
Athenian assembly on the days in

00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:54.619
which these discussions took
place.

00:58:54.619 --> 00:58:58.769
The essence of the
Corcyraean argument is

00:58:58.769 --> 00:59:02.920
that--well, here are the points
they make.

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:06.583
Corinth is wrong,
it is not a breach of the

00:59:06.583 --> 00:59:11.729
thirty-years peace for Athens to
accept the Corcyraeans into

00:59:11.729 --> 00:59:16.090
their alliance because neutrals
are permitted.

00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:18.554
Then they go through a lot of
stuff to show that the

00:59:18.554 --> 00:59:21.875
Corinthians are bad guys,
making arguments on the grounds

00:59:21.875 --> 00:59:25.579
of morality and virtue and
decency and obeying the law and

00:59:25.579 --> 00:59:28.560
all kinds of stuff,
but it's clear that that's not

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.303
what's on their minds.
They are talking

00:59:31.303 --> 00:59:36.836
about--basically they try to
convince the Athenians on the

00:59:36.836 --> 00:59:42.660
grounds of the significance of
their decision for the balance

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:46.676
of power,
and essentially the balance of

00:59:46.676 --> 00:59:49.510
naval power in the Greek world.

00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:56.253
In passing,
they make the point that

00:59:56.253 --> 01:00:01.827
Corcyra is very well situated
for a naval--I should--for a sea

01:00:01.827 --> 01:00:06.749
voyage to Sicily and Italy,
where the Athenians and others

01:00:06.749 --> 01:00:10.349
are always wanting to go.
So, you want to be on our side.

01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:15.316
That's not really a very potent
argument, because no town,

01:00:15.316 --> 01:00:20.805
no polis shuts its ports
to any other polis except

01:00:20.805 --> 01:00:24.410
in war time.
So, it's only when they mention

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:28.760
it, they only have to be talking
about why it's valuable to be

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:32.586
allied with Corcyra,
because and this is their most

01:00:32.586 --> 01:00:36.739
powerful underlying argument,
there's going to be a war.

01:00:36.739 --> 01:00:39.349
Don't kid yourself Athenians is
what they are saying,

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:42.159
and when that war comes you're
going to want to be us.

01:00:42.159 --> 01:00:44.619
You're going to want to have us
on your side,

01:00:44.619 --> 01:00:47.303
in part because of our
convenience, our strategic

01:00:47.303 --> 01:00:49.472
location.
On the other hand,

01:00:49.472 --> 01:00:53.340
more powerful is the fact--we
have a hundred twenty ships.

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:58.291
If we lose, if you let the
Corinthians beat us,

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:02.489
our ships will fall into their
hands,

01:01:02.489 --> 01:01:06.074
and then they will have a much
mightier fleet than even the one

01:01:06.074 --> 01:01:10.323
they have put together,
and now your unquestioned

01:01:10.323 --> 01:01:14.920
dominance of the sea will be
challenged.

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:20.607
That's what's at issue.
Don't imagine that this is just

01:01:20.607 --> 01:01:25.580
anybody's imagination.
This is going to happen.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:30.530
The war is coming;
an enormous amount of what's

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:36.242
happening here has to do with
your perception of whether the

01:01:36.242 --> 01:01:42.147
war is now inevitable or whether
by restraint you can preserve

01:01:42.147 --> 01:01:45.508
the peace.
That's the problem that the

01:01:45.508 --> 01:01:48.789
Athenians face.
It's a terribly interesting

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:53.090
one, because it happened so very
often on the brinks of wars,

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:57.555
when that's the issue that
determines what people will do

01:01:57.555 --> 01:02:01.633
and how they react.
If they don't think that taking

01:02:01.633 --> 01:02:06.131
a certain action--I'm sorry,
if they don't think the war is

01:02:06.131 --> 01:02:09.279
coming anyway,
they may very well decide to

01:02:09.279 --> 01:02:12.480
refrain from an action that
might provoke a war.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:16.116
If, on the other hand,
they think war is coming they

01:02:16.116 --> 01:02:20.608
feel that it's too dangerous not
to make our capacity to win the

01:02:20.608 --> 01:02:25.101
war more likely and so they may
well take a step which makes the

01:02:25.101 --> 01:02:29.800
war more likely,
and they're both gambles.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:32.250
Nobody knows for sure one way
or another;

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:35.554
you have to make an estimate
and that's always the way it is,

01:02:35.554 --> 01:02:38.418
unless you are simply an
aggressive state and all you

01:02:38.418 --> 01:02:40.803
want to do is conquer,
and you don't care about

01:02:40.803 --> 01:02:43.585
anything else.
You're always trying to figure

01:02:43.585 --> 01:02:47.010
out will it be safer to fight or
not to fight,

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:50.323
will it be safer to try to make
a concession or will that make

01:02:50.323 --> 01:02:53.375
it more dangerous.
Those are always the issues,

01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:56.339
always the problems.
One of the great

01:02:56.339 --> 01:03:00.733
imbecilities that I discovered
all through my life is people

01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:05.500
will contemplate going to war at
different times in our time,

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:09.269
is the quiet assumption,
unquestioned,

01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:14.873
unexamined that restraint,
the failure to take action is

01:03:14.873 --> 01:03:18.829
safe;
taking action is dangerous.

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:22.140
Whereas, our experience,
even in my lifetime,

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.000
has demonstrated that's often
wrong.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.112
Nothing could be clearer to me
and I think to most people who

01:03:29.112 --> 01:03:33.225
studied the subject that not
acting against Hitler as he took

01:03:33.225 --> 01:03:37.475
one step after another to rip up
a piece of Europe was the most

01:03:37.475 --> 01:03:40.559
dangerous thing they could
possibly do,

01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:45.187
far more dangerous than
confronting him as early as 1936

01:03:45.187 --> 01:03:49.720
when he invaded the Rhineland.
That's not the only case of it.

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.758
There's no simple rule.
Sometimes it's wiser not to

01:03:53.758 --> 01:03:57.916
act and sometimes it's wiser to
act, but it's never clear which

01:03:57.916 --> 01:04:01.269
one is more likely to produce
peace and safety,

01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:05.389
and that's what the Athenians
had to wrestle with on that day.

01:04:05.389 --> 01:04:10.097
The Corinthians responded to
the argument of the Corcyraeans

01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:15.172
denying their picture of things.
They said, in fact if you sign

01:04:15.172 --> 01:04:19.817
up with the Corcyraeans now,
you will be in violation of the

01:04:19.817 --> 01:04:23.535
thirty-years peace.
What they were saying I guess

01:04:23.535 --> 01:04:27.028
in the abstract was,
don't worry about the letter of

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:30.562
the law of the treaty;
because that clearly permits an

01:04:30.562 --> 01:04:33.309
alliance;
it's the spirit that counts.

01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:37.453
They said, surely nobody
imagined that this decision

01:04:37.453 --> 01:04:42.652
would be made at a time when the
neutral is asking you to join in

01:04:42.652 --> 01:04:45.740
was already at war with one of
us;

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:49.330
surely nobody had that in mind.
They're certainly right.

01:04:49.330 --> 01:04:52.027
Nobody did.
The question is,

01:04:52.027 --> 01:04:54.958
on the legal point,
my guess is the Athenians had

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:59.289
the better of the argument.
It says in black letter law;

01:04:59.289 --> 01:05:04.224
it says you may take a neutral
if a neutral asks you for an

01:05:04.224 --> 01:05:06.434
alliance.
There's nothing that says,

01:05:06.434 --> 01:05:08.390
except that when that neutral's
attacking us;

01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:10.551
it doesn't say that.
On the other hand,

01:05:10.551 --> 01:05:12.646
who in his right mind could
imagine it would be okay to do

01:05:12.646 --> 01:05:15.332
that?
So, that was one issue that the

01:05:15.332 --> 01:05:18.751
Corinthians spoke to.
But they made another point

01:05:18.751 --> 01:05:22.705
that was legalistic as well and
this one I think in the case of

01:05:22.705 --> 01:05:26.895
the Corinthians is much worse.
They said the principle

01:05:26.895 --> 01:05:32.425
established in the thirty-years
peace was that each side could

01:05:32.425 --> 01:05:37.683
punish its own allies without
the interference of the other

01:05:37.683 --> 01:05:40.819
side.
Now, as a matter of fact,

01:05:40.819 --> 01:05:44.279
it didn't say that,
but the other thing that's

01:05:44.279 --> 01:05:49.256
wrong with that statement is,
it's one thing for Athens to

01:05:49.256 --> 01:05:52.582
punish Samos,
which is an ally and the

01:05:52.582 --> 01:05:56.085
Corinthians saying fine,
that's your business,

01:05:56.085 --> 01:06:00.748
we won't intervene.
But Corcyra is not the ally of

01:06:00.748 --> 01:06:03.079
Corinth.
In fact, they are bitter

01:06:03.079 --> 01:06:06.605
enemies of yester year.
There's no part of that treaty

01:06:06.605 --> 01:06:10.719
that protects the Corinthian
right to attack Corcyra.

01:06:10.719 --> 01:06:14.547
So, it's a great argument if
you don't look at the validity

01:06:14.547 --> 01:06:19.366
of the facts that are alleged.
Corinth has got a very bad case

01:06:19.366 --> 01:06:21.680
here.
But their really important

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:26.013
argument is this.
The Corcyraeans say the war

01:06:26.013 --> 01:06:30.159
is inevitable;
well, it isn't.

01:06:30.159 --> 01:06:33.591
The fact is they tell the
Athenians, if you were smart the

01:06:33.591 --> 01:06:36.059
thing you would do would be to
join us,

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:39.233
and together we'll smash the
Corcyraeans and then there's no

01:06:39.233 --> 01:06:41.918
more problem.
But if you don't do that,

01:06:41.918 --> 01:06:45.149
at the very least,
refrain from joining them

01:06:45.149 --> 01:06:49.807
because then we will be friends,
and then we will have peace in

01:06:49.807 --> 01:06:53.076
the future.
But make no mistake about it,

01:06:53.076 --> 01:06:56.640
if you do accept the
Corcyraeans into your alliance

01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:01.131
now, then there will be war.
War is not inevitable,

01:07:01.131 --> 01:07:05.280
but your action can make it
inevitable.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.456
So, that's what the Athenians
confront when they have to make

01:07:09.456 --> 01:07:12.728
their decision.
Again, the drama of this is so

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:16.000
striking I want to be sure you
conceive of it.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.854
They are sitting there;
everything I've told you so far

01:07:19.854 --> 01:07:23.476
has been said on the same day
and now the Athenians start

01:07:23.476 --> 01:07:27.969
talking about what should we do;
it's the same day.

01:07:27.969 --> 01:07:31.936
The people who are sitting
on the Pnyx, if the day is clear

01:07:31.936 --> 01:07:35.199
as they used to be in Athens
just about everyday,

01:07:35.199 --> 01:07:40.561
can look out across Attica to
the north and they can see that

01:07:40.561 --> 01:07:45.922
area into which the Spartan and
Peloponnesian army will march

01:07:45.922 --> 01:07:51.820
and start destroying their farms
three days from now possibly,

01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:56.699
if a war starts.
Who is going to be doing that

01:07:56.699 --> 01:07:59.949
fighting out there?
We will;

01:07:59.949 --> 01:08:04.921
those of us who are sitting
here voting whether to go to war

01:08:04.921 --> 01:08:08.489
or not.
I'm always struck by the

01:08:08.489 --> 01:08:15.630
immediacy and the significance
of what these guys are doing.

01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:19.260
Somebody tell me this is not a
democracy, please.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:24.077
So, it is of course the same
kind of thing they faced back in

01:08:24.077 --> 01:08:28.814
461, when they had to decide
whether to take Megara into the

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:31.614
alliance, again.
There are significant

01:08:31.614 --> 01:08:34.460
differences, but the issue is
very much the same.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:38.973
They can't be sure.
Maybe if they back off and

01:08:38.973 --> 01:08:41.994
refuse the alliance,
maybe that will be the end of

01:08:41.994 --> 01:08:45.140
the problem and they'll live
happily ever after.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.720
On the other hand,
if they're wrong about that and

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.619
the Corinthians take over this
fleet,

01:08:49.619 --> 01:08:54.460
suddenly they will find
themselves vulnerable in a way

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:58.662
they have not been,
since they put their empire

01:08:58.662 --> 01:09:01.666
together.
I always find it illuminating

01:09:01.666 --> 01:09:04.108
to me anyway,
and I hope to you as well,

01:09:04.108 --> 01:09:07.365
to make an analogy to Great
Britain at the end of the

01:09:07.365 --> 01:09:11.060
nineteenth and the beginning of
the twentieth century.

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:12.951
Great Britain,
at the beginning of the

01:09:12.951 --> 01:09:16.120
nineteenth, sort of the middle
and after the nineteenth century

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:19.289
came--had the greatest navy in
the world without question.

01:09:19.289 --> 01:09:21.619
It was the greatest power in
the world.

01:09:21.619 --> 01:09:27.500
It had this enormous empire
that it ruled and its

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:34.359
vulnerabilities were mainly
against France and Russia,

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:40.029
who were two imperial rivals in
the areas that the British cared

01:09:40.029 --> 01:09:43.905
about most.
At a certain point they decided

01:09:43.905 --> 01:09:49.142
to make their fleet to be the
size of the next two fleets put

01:09:49.142 --> 01:09:52.468
together,
in order to feel secure in case

01:09:52.468 --> 01:09:55.630
a war broke out,
and that's what they did.

01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:59.763
Everything was fine until
Kaiser William becomes the

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:03.896
Emperor of Germany and towards
the end of the nineteenth

01:10:03.896 --> 01:10:08.479
century decides that Germany
must be a great naval power.

01:10:08.479 --> 01:10:12.907
It must be a world empire,
it must challenge Britain for

01:10:12.907 --> 01:10:17.898
that opportunity and they begin
to build a fleet of battleships

01:10:17.898 --> 01:10:22.728
whose only purpose can be to
destroy the British fleet and to

01:10:22.728 --> 01:10:26.109
allow the Germans to invade
Britain,

01:10:26.109 --> 01:10:30.704
or best of all to intimidate
the British into stepping aside

01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:34.909
and allowing the Germans to do
what they want to do.

01:10:34.909 --> 01:10:37.999
As soon as this becomes clear
to the British,

01:10:37.999 --> 01:10:41.579
as soon as the Germans start
building that fleet,

01:10:41.579 --> 01:10:45.315
it is not yet strong enough to
defeat the British fleet,

01:10:45.315 --> 01:10:49.117
and the British enter into a
naval race to see to it that

01:10:49.117 --> 01:10:53.600
they don't get to be big enough
to take out the British fleet.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:56.568
But it's very costly,
the British don't like it,

01:10:56.568 --> 01:11:00.649
they try to find every way,
and what they do is completely

01:11:00.649 --> 01:11:05.000
flip their diplomacy which has
dominated their behavior for

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.574
over a hundred years and they
make an alliance with France and

01:11:09.574 --> 01:11:13.399
Russia to see to it that the
Germans are checked and

01:11:13.399 --> 01:11:17.600
prevented from doing what
they're planning to do.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:21.833
I think that does help to
understand what the Athenians

01:11:21.833 --> 01:11:23.440
are doing.
When you are,

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.530
as in the case of Britain,
an island state and as in the

01:11:26.530 --> 01:11:29.619
case of Athens you might as well
be an island state,

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:33.496
because you are dependent on
imports for your food supply and

01:11:33.496 --> 01:11:37.180
the command of the sea is
essential for acquiring that,

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:42.875
in such a case it is not a
light thing to permit a change

01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:48.868
in the naval balance of power,
which may make you seriously

01:11:48.868 --> 01:11:52.977
vulnerable in case of war.
The point I want to make is

01:11:52.977 --> 01:11:56.074
that the British didn't wait
until the Germans had equaled

01:11:56.074 --> 01:11:58.966
their force;
they changed their policy and

01:11:58.966 --> 01:12:03.189
ultimately moved into war to
prevent it and that's where the

01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:05.909
Athenians I think found
themselves.

01:12:05.909 --> 01:12:09.119
It was something they were not
willing to do,

01:12:09.119 --> 01:12:12.984
but it was a very hard call,
and we are told that they

01:12:12.984 --> 01:12:17.287
argued so long that it got dark
before the decision could be

01:12:17.287 --> 01:12:19.881
made.
Thucydides says,

01:12:19.881 --> 01:12:25.168
it was thought that they were
inclining against the alliance

01:12:25.168 --> 01:12:29.182
when it got dark.
They met again the next day and

01:12:29.182 --> 01:12:33.053
this time they voted for
something a bit different from

01:12:33.053 --> 01:12:36.710
what they had been talking about
the day before.

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:41.164
What the Corcyrians had been
requesting was a typical

01:12:41.164 --> 01:12:45.619
alliance, the only kind we know
of between Greeks,

01:12:45.619 --> 01:12:49.621
a symmachia,
an offensive and defensive

01:12:49.621 --> 01:12:53.076
alliance.
It would have required the

01:12:53.076 --> 01:12:57.362
Athenians to go out and fight
the Corinthians,

01:12:57.362 --> 01:13:02.029
even if the Corinthians didn't
attack Corcyra.

01:13:02.029 --> 01:13:05.020
It would have put them fully at
war against the Corinthians.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:08.590
That's not what the Athenians
voted.

01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:12.962
On the second day they voted on
the proposition that they

01:13:12.962 --> 01:13:16.710
established something called an
epimachia,

01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:19.989
which means a defensive
alliance only.

01:13:19.989 --> 01:13:24.592
They would only fight against
an enemy, if that enemy had

01:13:24.592 --> 01:13:29.359
attacked Corcyra and was in the
process of landing on their

01:13:29.359 --> 01:13:34.216
territory,
and so that's finally what the

01:13:34.216 --> 01:13:37.640
Athenians did.
That was the vote they took.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.668
Once again, we have something
unheard of before,

01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:46.211
a device which is in a way
largely a diplomatic device

01:13:46.211 --> 01:13:51.268
meant to have consequences on
thinking rather than immediate

01:13:51.268 --> 01:13:54.749
military results.
So, I say it's got to be

01:13:54.749 --> 01:13:58.649
Pericles, but I feel better this
time, because Plutarch says,

01:13:58.649 --> 01:14:02.647
it was Pericles even though
Thucydides doesn't say who made

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:05.357
that proposal.
It was clearly what Pericles

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:08.170
wanted because he holds to it
very, very firmly,

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:11.519
in both directions,
both in terms of the limits

01:14:11.519 --> 01:14:14.140
that this puts on Athenian
action,

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:18.430
but on the determination to
take that action no matter what.

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:22.421
What I suggest to you is that
we are going to be dealing from

01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:26.680
here on in--we have been dealing
with in a general way anyway,

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:30.800
but now it's very clear,
this is Pericles' policy.

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:34.889
I assert it is a policy
intended to keep the peace,

01:14:34.889 --> 01:14:38.406
and here again,
we run into a problem in our

01:14:38.406 --> 01:14:43.560
own time in which sort of the
normal reaction of people is,

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.793
if you want to keep the peace
,what you want to do is to be a

01:14:47.793 --> 01:14:50.646
nice guy.
What you want to do is to make

01:14:50.646 --> 01:14:54.729
concessions, you want not to
frighten the potential enemy,

01:14:54.729 --> 01:14:57.796
you want to show that you have
no ill-will towards him,

01:14:57.796 --> 01:15:01.203
and then reason will prevail
and you can all have a nice chat

01:15:01.203 --> 01:15:03.528
and go off for tea.
Of course,

01:15:03.528 --> 01:15:05.930
that's not the way it is at
all.

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:10.221
One way always that has been
used by nations in the hope of

01:15:10.221 --> 01:15:13.699
keeping peace is through the
opposite device,

01:15:13.699 --> 01:15:18.308
of deterrence where there isn't
any hope of coming to a happy

01:15:18.308 --> 01:15:20.507
agreement.
Of course, if there had been

01:15:20.507 --> 01:15:22.470
you wouldn't be in the spot
you're in now.

01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:26.488
All you can do is try to
indicate to your opponent that

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:29.539
he will not achieve the goals he
seeks,

01:15:29.539 --> 01:15:34.627
if he launches a war against
you, and so that requires that

01:15:34.627 --> 01:15:38.787
you be very strong,
militarily strong and strong in

01:15:38.787 --> 01:15:42.371
the way in which you negotiate.
On the other hand,

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:45.748
if that is your goal,
deterrence, then you also want

01:15:45.748 --> 01:15:49.654
to be very careful not to behave
in such a way that it's too

01:15:49.654 --> 01:15:53.662
frightening.
That indicates to your opponent

01:15:53.662 --> 01:15:59.148
that you are likely to defeat
him, if he allows you to be as

01:15:59.148 --> 01:16:04.575
strong as you would like to be.
You want to avoid taking an

01:16:04.575 --> 01:16:08.435
action that will make him lose
his rationality,

01:16:08.435 --> 01:16:13.301
that will make him so angry
that he will forget about these

01:16:13.301 --> 01:16:16.489
questions of success and
failure,

01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:20.301
he'll just say I'm going to get
that son of a gun and that,

01:16:20.301 --> 01:16:23.390
I argue, is the policy that
Pericles pursued.

01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:28.152
An attempt at deterrence
and moderation at the same time,

01:16:28.152 --> 01:16:32.914
to frighten the opponent by his
determination out of thinking

01:16:32.914 --> 01:16:37.279
they can do what they want
without a danger of war,

01:16:37.279 --> 01:16:41.240
but also to avoid inflaming his
anger.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.002
In the short run,
what happens is that the

01:16:51.002 --> 01:16:58.565
Athenians send to assist their
Corcyrian allies a fleet of only

01:16:58.565 --> 01:17:02.977
ten triremes.
This is inexplicable in my

01:17:02.977 --> 01:17:08.460
view, except in terms of the
strategy that I have suggested.

01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:12.227
What he's doing is sending
really not a force but a

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:15.538
diplomatic message.
He is telling the Corinthians,

01:17:15.538 --> 01:17:18.938
you have been counting on the
fact that we would stay out of

01:17:18.938 --> 01:17:23.059
this, well you were wrong.
We will not allow you to defeat

01:17:23.059 --> 01:17:26.219
the Corcyraean navy,
because we find that

01:17:26.219 --> 01:17:30.500
unacceptable and dangerous.
So, we're sending this force to

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:34.445
help the Corcyraeans not because
we want to fight you but because

01:17:34.445 --> 01:17:37.650
we want you to see that we're
serious about this;

01:17:37.650 --> 01:17:42.328
don't start the fight.
Well, the Corinthians sail

01:17:42.328 --> 01:17:47.505
their fleet against Corcyra and
there follows a battle at sea

01:17:47.505 --> 01:17:53.770
called the Battle of Sybota,
and Thucydides describes the

01:17:53.770 --> 01:17:58.130
battle itself,
very tough battle.

01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:01.713
The Athenians are--I'm sorry I
haven't told you one thing you

01:18:01.713 --> 01:18:04.728
need to know.
The Athenians will line up at

01:18:04.728 --> 01:18:08.600
one end of the Corcyraean line
with their ten ships.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:14.449
The commanders of that fleet
are determined as well.

01:18:14.449 --> 01:18:17.229
Those ten ships are commanded
by three generals;

01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:22.449
that's a lot of generals for
ten ships, but one of them who

01:18:22.449 --> 01:18:26.229
is the chief figure there is
Lacedaemonius,

01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:30.014
the son of Cimon.
Well, of course,

01:18:30.014 --> 01:18:37.474
he is clearly seen by everybody
else as not one of the Pericles'

01:18:37.474 --> 01:18:43.479
boys, not a stooge of Pericles.
He's an independent and what's

01:18:43.479 --> 01:18:45.850
his name mean?
Mr. Spartan.

01:18:45.850 --> 01:18:50.791
Now, if the Athenians get
drawn into that battle and the

01:18:50.791 --> 01:18:55.899
command that we should do so is
done by Lacedaemonius then,

01:18:55.899 --> 01:18:58.703
of course, that will not have
the effect of dividing the

01:18:58.703 --> 01:19:01.456
Athenians but it will make it
much harder to divide the

01:19:01.456 --> 01:19:04.021
Athenians.
It would be much easier to say

01:19:04.021 --> 01:19:06.797
all Athenians,
even those who have the kindest

01:19:06.797 --> 01:19:10.869
attitude towards Sparta thought
that this was a necessary step,

01:19:10.869 --> 01:19:15.310
which I think was aimed not at
Corinthians so much.

01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:17.190
It was aimed,
of course, at Athenian

01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:20.037
politics, but I think it was
aimed at the Spartans too

01:19:20.037 --> 01:19:22.723
because then if the Spartans
were then asked by the

01:19:22.723 --> 01:19:24.807
Corinthians,
so look what happened,

01:19:24.807 --> 01:19:27.855
come in and help us against the
Athenians, they would have to

01:19:27.855 --> 01:19:30.547
face the fact that even
Lacedaemonius thought this was

01:19:30.547 --> 01:19:34.140
necessary.
It's the same game.

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:39.188
All of these are cagey moves by
Pericles to pursue his extremely

01:19:39.188 --> 01:19:42.314
complicated, tricky,
kind of a strategy,

01:19:42.314 --> 01:19:45.760
and I see that I have run over
my time.

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.000
So I'll pick up the tale next
time.

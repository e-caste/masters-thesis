00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.780
Shall we begin now?
 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.356
So as usual,
and as promised,

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:11.784
I will tell you what we have
done so far, and that's all you

00:00:11.784 --> 00:00:15.924
really need to know,
to follow what's going to

00:00:15.924 --> 00:00:17.580
happen next.
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.226
The first thing we learned is
if you're studying a particle

00:00:22.226 --> 00:00:26.214
living in one dimension,
that's all I'm going to do the

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:29.497
whole time because it's
mathematically easier and there

00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:33.450
is not many new things you gain
by going to higher dimensions.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.070
There's a particle somewhere in
this one-dimensional universe.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.701
Everything you need to know
about that particle is contained

00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:49.427
in a function called the wave
function, and is denoted by the

00:00:49.427 --> 00:00:51.050
symbol ψ.
 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.080
By the way, everything I'm
doing now is called kinematics.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.309
In other words,
kinematics is a study of how to

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.609
describe a system completely at
a given time.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.912
For example,
in classical mechanics for a

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:06.310
single particle the complete
description of that particle is

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.460
given by two things,
where is it,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.170
and what its momentum is.
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.090
Dynamics is the question of how
this changes with time.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.007
If you knew all you could know
about the particle now can you

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:22.030
predict the future?
 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.580
By predict the future we mean
can you tell me what x

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.953
will be at a later time and
p will be at a later

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:27.349
time.
 

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:29.709
That's Newtonian mechanics.
 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:32.358
So the kinematics is just how
much do you need to know at a

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.230
given time, just x and
p.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.840
Once you've got x and
p everything follows.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.300
As I mentioned to you,
the kinetic energy,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.388
for example,
which you write as

00:01:41.388 --> 00:01:45.039
½mv^(2),
is given just in terms of

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.989
p,
or in higher dimensions the

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:52.132
angular momentum is some cross
product of position and

00:01:52.132 --> 00:01:54.783
momentum,
so you can get everything of

00:01:54.783 --> 00:01:57.760
interest just by giving the
position and momentum.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.894
I claim now the equivalent of
this pair of numbers in this

00:02:02.894 --> 00:02:07.310
quantum world is one function,
ψ(x).

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.941
So it's a lot more information
than you had in classical

00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:10.419
physics.
 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.367
In classical physics two
numbers tell you the whole

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:12.680
story.
 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.218
Quantum theory says "give
me a whole function",

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.890
and we all know a function is
really infinite amount of

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.562
information because at every
point x the function has a

00:02:20.562 --> 00:02:22.840
height and you've got to give me
all that.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.729
Only then you have told me
everything.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:26.848
That's the definition.
 

00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:29.282
And the point is ψ
can be real,

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.145
ψ can be complex,
and sometimes ψ

00:02:32.145 --> 00:02:33.220
is complex.
 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.670
So we can ask,
you've got this function,

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.626
you say it tells me everything
I can know, well,

00:02:38.626 --> 00:02:41.330
what can I find out from this
function?

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.574
The first thing is that if you
took the absolute square of this

00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:50.889
function, that is the
probability density to find it

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.090
at the point x.
 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.667
By that I mean if you multiply
both by some infinitesimal

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:00.245
Δx that is the
probability that the particle

00:03:00.245 --> 00:03:03.120
will be between x and
x dx.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.188
That means that you take this
ψ and you square it.

00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:08.544
So you will get something that
will go to 0 here,

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:11.620
go up, go to zero,
do something like that.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.662
This is ψ^(2),
and that's your probability

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:18.840
density and what we mean by
density is,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.647
if the function p(x) has
an area with the x-axis

00:03:23.647 --> 00:03:28.300
like p(x)dx that's the
actual probability that if you

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.478
look for this guy you'll find
him or her or it in this

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:35.190
interval,
okay?

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.837
So we will make the requirement
that the total probability to

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:46.788
find it anywhere add up to 1.
 

00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:50.943
That is a convention
because--well,

00:03:50.943 --> 00:03:52.900
in some sense.
 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.990
It's up to you how you want to
define probability.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.617
You say, "What are the
odds I will get through this

00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:00.068
course, 50/50?"
 

00:04:00.068 --> 00:04:02.659
That doesn't add up to 1 that
adds up to 100,

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.310
but it gives you the impression
the relative odds are equal.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.150
So you can always give odds.
 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.087
Jimmy the Greek may tell you
something, 7 is to 4 something's

00:04:11.087 --> 00:04:11.969
going to happen.
 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:13.780
They don't add up to 1 either.
 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.089
I mean, 7 divided by 11 is one
thing and 4 divided by 11 is the

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.689
absolute probability.
 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:24.302
So in quantum theory the wave
function you're given need not

00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:29.230
necessarily have the property
that its square integral is 1,

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.610
but you can rescale it by a
suitable number,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.968
I mean, if it's not 1,
but if it's 100 then you divide

00:04:34.968 --> 00:04:38.899
it by 10 and that function will
have a square integral of 1.

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:41.793
That's the convention and it's
a convenience,

00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:45.279
and I will generally assume
that we have done that.

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.172
And I also pointed out to you
that the function ψ

00:04:48.172 --> 00:04:51.565
and the function 3 times ψ
stand for the same situation in

00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:52.790
quantum mechanics.
 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.379
So this ψ
is not like any other ψ.

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.781
And if ψ
is a water wave 3 inches versus

00:04:57.781 --> 00:05:00.572
30 inches are not the same
situation, they describe

00:05:00.572 --> 00:05:02.360
completely different things.
 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.185
But in quantum mechanics ψ
and a multiple of ψ

00:05:05.185 --> 00:05:08.117
have the same physics because
the same relative odds are

00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:09.290
contained in them.
 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.485
So given one ψ
you're free to multiply it by

00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:13.788
any number,
in fact, real or complex and

00:05:13.788 --> 00:05:15.970
that doesn't change any
prediction,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.887
so normally you multiply it by
that number which makes the

00:05:19.887 --> 00:05:22.980
square integral in all of space
equal to 1.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.100
Such a function is said to be
normalized.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.358
If it's normalized the
advantage is the square directly

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:32.619
gives you the absolute
probability density and integral

00:05:32.619 --> 00:05:34.310
of that will give you 1.
 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.730
That's one thing we learned.
 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.069
You understand now?
 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.250
What are the possible functions
I can ascribe with the particle?

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.737
Whatever you like within reason;
it's got to be a single value

00:05:46.737 --> 00:05:49.009
and it cannot have discontinuous
jumps.

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.959
Beyond that anything you write
down is fine.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:54.170
That's like saying what are the
allowed positions,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.879
or allowed momentum for a
particle in classical mechanics?

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.322
Anything, there are no
restrictions except x

00:05:59.322 --> 00:06:01.180
should be real and p should be
real.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.569
You can do what you want.
 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.281
Similarly all possible
functions describe possible

00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.569
quantum states.
 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:09.920
It's called a quantum state.
 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.839
It's this crazy situation where
you don't know where it is and

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.660
you give the odds by squaring
ψ.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.386
That's called a quantum state
and it's given by a function

00:06:18.386 --> 00:06:18.910
ψ.
 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:25.312
All right, now I also said
there is one case where I know

00:06:25.312 --> 00:06:27.370
what's going on.
 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.310
So let me give you one other
case.

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:31.730
Maybe I will ask you to give me
one case.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:36.293
The particle is known to be
very close to x = 5

00:06:36.293 --> 00:06:41.286
because I just saw it there and
ε later I know it's

00:06:41.286 --> 00:06:45.420
still got to be there because I
just saw it.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:52.620
Now what function will describe
that situation?

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.490
You guys know this.
 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.389
Want to guess?
 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.247
What will ψ
look like so that the particle

00:07:00.247 --> 00:07:02.790
is almost certainly near
x = 5?

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.920
Student: 
&gt;

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.060
Prof: Yeah?
 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.569
Centered where?
 

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:09.149
Student:  Centered at 5.
 

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:12.000
Prof: At 5,
everybody agree with that?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.629
I mean the exact shape we don't
know.

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:17.521
Maybe that's why you're
hesitating, but here is the

00:07:17.521 --> 00:07:22.502
possible function that describes
a particle that's location isn't

00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:25.149
known to within some accuracy.
 

00:07:25.149 --> 00:07:26.264
So one look at it,
it tells you,

00:07:26.264 --> 00:07:27.740
"Hey, this guy's close to
5."

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.129
I agree that you can put a few
wiggles on it,

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:32.646
or you can make it taller or
shorter if you change the shape

00:07:32.646 --> 00:07:36.302
a bit,
but roughly speaking here is

00:07:36.302 --> 00:07:39.377
what functions,
describing particles of

00:07:39.377 --> 00:07:42.139
reasonably well know location,
look like.

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:45.557
They're centered at the point
which is the well-known

00:07:45.557 --> 00:07:46.279
location.
 

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:50.254
On the other hand,
I'm going to call is ψ

00:07:50.254 --> 00:07:51.610
x = 5.
 

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.665
That is a function,
and the subscript you put on

00:07:54.665 --> 00:07:57.720
the function is a name you give
the function.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.459
We don't go to a party and say,
"Hi, I am human."

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:04.302
You say, "I'm so and
so," because that tells you

00:08:04.302 --> 00:08:07.810
a little more than whatever
species you belong to.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.615
Similarly these are all
normalizable wave functions,

00:08:11.615 --> 00:08:14.899
but x = 5 is one member
of the family,

00:08:14.899 --> 00:08:18.110
which means I'm peaked at
x = 5.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:20.877
Another function I mentioned is
the function

00:08:20.877 --> 00:08:22.810
ψ_p(x).
 

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:27.372
That's the function that
describes a particle of momentum

00:08:27.372 --> 00:08:28.269
p.
 

00:08:28.269 --> 00:08:30.488
We sort of inferred that by
doing the double slit

00:08:30.488 --> 00:08:31.089
experiment.
 

00:08:31.089 --> 00:08:32.500
That function looks like this.
 

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:42.090
Some number A times
e^(ipx/ℏ).

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.432
Now you can no longer tell me
you have no feeling for these

00:08:44.432 --> 00:08:47.100
exponentials because it's going
to be all about the exponential.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.908
I've been warning you the whole
term.

00:08:48.908 --> 00:08:51.129
Get used to those complex
exponentials.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:51.940
It's got a real part.
 

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.008
It's got an imaginary part,
but more natural to think of a

00:08:55.008 --> 00:08:57.700
complex number as having a
modulus and a phase,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.220
and I'm telling you it's a
constant modulus.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.278
I don't know what it is.
 

00:09:00.278 --> 00:09:05.028
But the phase factor should
look like ipx/ℏ.

00:09:05.028 --> 00:09:08.235
So if I wrote a function
e to the i times

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:10.908
96x/ℏ,
and I said, "What's going

00:09:10.908 --> 00:09:11.678
on?"
 

00:09:11.678 --> 00:09:14.440
Well, that's a particle whose
momentum is 96.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.331
So the momentum is hidden in
the function right in the

00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:19.360
exponential.
 

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.354
It's everything x of the
i, the x and the

00:09:21.354 --> 00:09:21.778
ℏ.
 

00:09:21.778 --> 00:09:24.830
Whatever is sitting there
that's the momentum.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.399
I am going to study such states
pretty much all of today.

00:09:29.399 --> 00:09:31.652
So let's say someone says,
"Look, I produced a

00:09:31.652 --> 00:09:33.590
particle in a state of momentum
p.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.220
Here it is.
 

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.460
Let's normalize this guy."
 

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.530
To normalize the guy you've got
to take ψ^(2) and you've got

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:46.408
to take the dx and you've
got to get it equal to 1.

00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:50.019
If you take the absolute square
of this, A absolute

00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:51.918
square is some fixed number.
 

00:09:51.918 --> 00:09:55.384
I hope you all know the
absolute value of that is 1

00:09:55.384 --> 00:09:57.879
because that times its
conjugate,

00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:00.613
which is e^(−ipx/â„ )
will just give you

00:10:00.613 --> 00:10:01.980
e^(0) which is 1.
 

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:12.009
I want 1 times dx over
all of space to be equal to 1.

00:10:12.009 --> 00:10:15.331
That's a hopeless task because
you cannot pick an A to

00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.404
make that happen,
because all of space,

00:10:17.404 --> 00:10:20.116
the integral of dx over
all of space is the length of

00:10:20.116 --> 00:10:23.754
the universe you're living in,
and if that's infinite no

00:10:23.754 --> 00:10:26.080
finite A will do it.
 

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.371
So that poses a mathematical
challenge, and people circumvent

00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:31.658
it in many ways.
 

00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:34.433
One is to say,
"Let's pretend our

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:37.210
universe is large and
finite."

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.129
It may even be the case because
we don't know.

00:10:40.129 --> 00:10:42.967
And I'm doing quantum mechanics
in which I'm fooling around in a

00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:44.769
tiny region like atoms and
molecules,

00:10:44.769 --> 00:10:47.811
and it really doesn't matter if
the universe even goes beyond

00:10:47.811 --> 00:10:48.419
this room.
 

00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:49.929
It goes beyond this room.
 

00:10:49.929 --> 00:10:51.029
It goes beyond the planet.
 

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:52.370
It goes beyond the solar system.
 

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.577
I grant you all that,
but I say allow me to believe

00:10:55.577 --> 00:10:59.750
that if it goes sufficiently far
enough it's a closed universe.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.820
So a closed universe is like
this.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.690
A closed one-dimensional
universe is a circle.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.995
In that universe if you throw a
rock it'll come back and hit you

00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:11.730
from behind.
 

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.534
In fact you can see the back of
your head in this universe

00:11:14.534 --> 00:11:16.750
because everything goes around
in a circle.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:21.750
All right, so that's the world
you take.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.320
Now that looks kind of
artificial for the real world,

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.000
which we all agree seems to be
miles and miles long,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.010
but I don't care for this
purpose what L is as long

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:30.908
as it's finite.
 

00:11:30.908 --> 00:11:33.750
If L is finite,
any number you like,

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:37.404
then the ψ
of p of x will

00:11:37.404 --> 00:11:41.669
look like 1/√L
e^(ipx/â„ ).

00:11:41.669 --> 00:11:43.120
Do you agree?
 

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.240
If you take the absolute square
of this you'll get a 1/L.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.418
This'll become 1.
 

00:11:47.418 --> 00:11:51.427
The integral of 1 of L
over the length of space is just

00:11:51.427 --> 00:11:51.690
1.
 

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.048
So that's the normalized wave
function.

00:11:55.048 --> 00:11:59.253
Now this is also a very
realistic thing if in practice

00:11:59.253 --> 00:12:03.220
your particle is restricted to
live in a circle.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.298
Again, there are a lot of
experiments being done,

00:12:05.298 --> 00:12:08.486
including at Yale,
where there's a tiny metallic

00:12:08.486 --> 00:12:10.407
ring,
a nano scale object,

00:12:10.407 --> 00:12:13.990
and the electrons are forced to
lived in that ring.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:18.238
So the ring has a radius and
this L is just 2ΠR

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:20.590
where R is the radius.
 

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.600
There L is very real.
 

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.710
It's not something you cooked
up.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.951
It's the size of the ring,
but sometimes even if you're

00:12:26.951 --> 00:12:29.807
not doing particle in a ring,
if you're doing particle in a

00:12:29.807 --> 00:12:32.808
line you just pretend that the
line closes in on itself.

00:12:32.808 --> 00:12:36.528
That if you start at the origin
and you go on the two sides it

00:12:36.528 --> 00:12:37.259
closes in.
 

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:41.741
If this is x = 0 you go
right and you go left they all

00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:44.879
meet at the back and it's a
closed ring.

00:12:44.879 --> 00:12:50.193
So let's imagine what life
looks like for a particle forced

00:12:50.193 --> 00:12:54.408
to live in a ring of
circumference L.

00:12:54.408 --> 00:12:59.217
The normalized wave function
looks like this of momentum

00:12:59.217 --> 00:13:00.178
p.
 

00:13:00.178 --> 00:13:06.269
This is 1/√L
e^(ipx/â„ ).

00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:11.105
The probability to find this
guy at some point x which

00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:15.620
is the absolute value of
ψ^(2) is just 1/L.

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.220
That means the probability is
constant over the entire ring.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.370
We don't know where it is.
 

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.360
You can find it anywhere with
equal probability.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.956
It's always true that if you
know the momentum you don't know

00:13:26.956 --> 00:13:28.028
where it is.
 

00:13:28.028 --> 00:13:35.200
Now let's ask one other
question.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.538
Here is the circle in which I'm
living.

00:13:39.538 --> 00:13:42.042
If you look at the real part
and imaginary part with their

00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:43.929
sines and cosines they kind of
oscillate.

00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:44.908
Do you understand that?
 

00:13:44.908 --> 00:13:46.918
When the x varies they
oscillate.

00:13:46.918 --> 00:13:50.774
And one requirement you make
that if you go all the way

00:13:50.774 --> 00:13:54.629
around and come back it's got to
close in on itself.

00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:58.658
Because if you increase
x from anywhere by an

00:13:58.658 --> 00:14:01.330
amount L,
which is going all the way

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.354
around the circle,
you've got to come back to

00:14:03.354 --> 00:14:04.090
where you start.
 

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.565
The function has to come back
where you started meaning it's a

00:14:07.565 --> 00:14:08.990
single valued function.
 

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.499
If you say what's ψ
here you've got to get one

00:14:11.499 --> 00:14:11.960
number.
 

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.190
That means if you start at some
point,

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.450
you go on moving,
you follow the ψ,

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.104
you go all the way around and
you come back you shouldn't have

00:14:18.104 --> 00:14:18.669
a mismatch.
 

00:14:18.669 --> 00:14:20.019
It should agree.
 

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:24.673
So the only allowed functions
are those obeying the condition

00:14:24.673 --> 00:14:27.620
ψ(x L) =
ψ(x).

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.668
You understand that?
 

00:14:29.668 --> 00:14:33.241
Take any point you like,
follow the function for a

00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:34.700
distance L.
 

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.250
That means you come back and
the function better come back.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.976
So a function like e to
the −x^(2) is not a

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:47.940
good function to go around a
circle and come back.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:51.323
If you go in real space,
if you go on all the way it

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:53.779
doesn't come back to where you
are.

00:14:53.779 --> 00:14:56.888
So you've got the right
functions which have the

00:14:56.888 --> 00:15:00.789
property that when you add L to
them you come back where you

00:15:00.789 --> 00:15:01.320
are.
 

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:09.288
That's a condition of single
valuedness.

00:15:09.288 --> 00:15:15.635
So that means in this function
if I take it at some point

00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:21.643
e^(ipx) at some point
x then I add to it

00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:25.668
L,
namely I'm getting

00:15:25.668 --> 00:15:31.769
e^(ipx/ℏ) times
e^(ipL/ℏ).

00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:36.061
That has to agree with the
starting value which is

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:37.899
e^(ipx/ℏ).
 

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:40.471
In other words I'm comparing
the wave function at the point

00:15:40.471 --> 00:15:42.070
x and the point x
L.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.386
See, if your world is infinite
this is x,

00:15:45.386 --> 00:15:48.139
this is x L,
this is x 2L,

00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:50.470
they're all different points.
 

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.073
What the function does here has
nothing to do with what it does

00:15:54.073 --> 00:15:55.754
here,
but if you wrapped out the

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:58.465
region back into itself what it
does when you go a distance

00:15:58.465 --> 00:16:00.847
L is no longer
independent of what it does at

00:16:00.847 --> 00:16:01.970
the starting point.
 

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.460
It has to be the same thing.
 

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.129
Therefore, I'm just applying
the test.

00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:10.528
I'm saying take the function at
x L, factorize it this

00:16:10.528 --> 00:16:13.759
way, demand that it be equal to
a function of x.

00:16:13.759 --> 00:16:22.210
These cancel and you learn then
that e^(ipL/ℏ) should

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.179
be 1.
 

00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:24.389
Now how can that be 1?
 

00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:29.774
Well, one way is p = 0,
but I hope you know that it's

00:16:29.774 --> 00:16:31.509
not the only way.
 

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:35.288
Do you know how else it can be
1 should p be 0?

00:16:35.288 --> 00:16:38.889
Student: 
&gt;

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:39.620
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.600
Student: 
&gt;

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.720
Prof: I didn't hear
that, sorry.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.610
Student:  It's infinite.
 

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.240
Prof: I didn't hear that
again.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.908
Student:  It's infinite
&gt;

00:16:47.908 --> 00:16:49.820
Prof: You still have to
say it louder.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.332
Student:  If it is
infinite

00:16:52.332 --> 00:16:54.389
&gt;
 

00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:55.309
Prof: Any other answers?
 

00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.970
Yeah?
 

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:58.379
Student:  If it's a
multiple of 2Π.

00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:00.279
Prof: Is that what you
said multiple of 2Π?

00:17:00.279 --> 00:17:01.470
Student:  Sure.
 

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:02.250
Prof: Good.
 

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.299
I'm glad you didn't say it loud
enough.

00:17:04.299 --> 00:17:05.130
Okay good.
 

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.938
It's a multiple of 2Π
because any trigonometry

00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:12.157
function if you add 2Π,
or 4Π, or 6Π

00:17:12.157 --> 00:17:15.271
whose argument doesn't change
then you should never forget the

00:17:15.271 --> 00:17:18.181
fact that this exponential is
the sum of two trigonometric

00:17:18.181 --> 00:17:22.308
functions cosine i sine,
and they all come back.

00:17:22.308 --> 00:17:25.920
Therefore, it is too strong to
say p should be 0.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:33.607
 p should be such that
pL/â„  is 2Π

00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:40.089
times any integer when the
integer can be 0,

00:17:40.089 --> 00:17:46.118
plus minus 1,
plus minus 2 etcetera.

00:17:46.118 --> 00:17:55.132
That means p has to be
equal to 2Πâ„ /L times

00:17:55.132 --> 00:18:02.076
m where m is an
integer, positive,

00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:04.440
negative, 0.
 

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.089
Now this is a very big moment
in your life.

00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:11.079
Why is it a big moment?
 

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:12.529
Yes?
 

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:13.950
You don't know?
 

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.714
Well if you haven't done it
before, this is the first time

00:18:17.714 --> 00:18:21.151
you're able to deduce the
quantization of a dynamical

00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:22.009
variable.
 

00:18:22.009 --> 00:18:26.105
This is the first time you
realize this is the quantum of

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.348
quantum theory.
 

00:18:27.348 --> 00:18:30.160
The allowed momenta for this
particle living in there,

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.259
you might think it can zip
around at any speed it likes,

00:18:32.259 --> 00:18:39.169
it cannot, especially in a ring
of nano proportions these values

00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:42.569
of p are all discrete.
 

00:18:42.569 --> 00:18:43.630
p times..
 

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.445
2Πâ„ /L times 0 is
here, times 1 is here,

00:18:47.445 --> 00:18:49.734
times 2 is here,
3 is here, -1,

00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:50.269
-2.
 

00:18:50.269 --> 00:18:54.858
These are the only allowed
values of p.

00:18:54.858 --> 00:18:57.368
So that's the case of
quantization,

00:18:57.368 --> 00:19:01.294
and the quantization came from
demanding that the wave function

00:19:01.294 --> 00:19:04.838
had a certain behavior that's
mathematically required.

00:19:04.838 --> 00:19:08.710
The behavior in question is
single valuedness.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.818
Now I can say this in another
way.

00:19:10.818 --> 00:19:13.910
Let's write the same
relationship in another way.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:16.130
So let me go here.
 

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:21.396
So I had the allowed values of
p are 2Πâ„ /L

00:19:21.396 --> 00:19:22.890
times m.
 

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.195
I can write it as p
times L/2Π

00:19:27.195 --> 00:19:29.630
is equal to mℏ.
 

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:35.118
L/2Π
is the radius of the circle.

00:19:35.118 --> 00:19:39.327
So I find that p times
R is equal to

00:19:39.327 --> 00:19:40.529
mℏ.
 

00:19:40.529 --> 00:19:43.560
You guys know what p
times R is for a particle

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.720
moving in a circle at momentum
p?

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.548
What is the momentum times the
radial distance to the center?

00:19:49.548 --> 00:19:51.200
Student:  Angular
momentum.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.838
Prof: Angular momentum.
 

00:19:52.838 --> 00:19:57.173
That's usually denoted by a
quantity L in quantum

00:19:57.173 --> 00:19:58.118
mechanics.
 

00:19:58.118 --> 00:20:03.980
So angular momentum is an
integral multiple of ℏ.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.356
That's something you will find
even in high school people will

00:20:06.356 --> 00:20:08.930
tell you angular momentum is an
integral multiple of ℏ.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.770
Where does it come from and how
does it come from quantum

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.380
mechanics?
 

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:17.238
Here is one simple context in
which you can see the angular

00:20:17.238 --> 00:20:20.588
momentum is quantized to these
values.

00:20:20.588 --> 00:20:25.750
Now what I will do quite often
is to write the state ψ

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.528
as ψ of p this way,
e^(2Π), I'm sorry,

00:20:30.528 --> 00:20:34.719
e^(ipx/ℏ),
but to remind myself that p

00:20:34.719 --> 00:20:39.933
is quantized to be integer
multiples of some basic quantum

00:20:39.933 --> 00:20:43.440
where the multiple is just
m,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.846
I may also write the very same
function the ψ's of m

00:20:48.846 --> 00:20:52.509
is 1/√L
e^(ix/â„ ),

00:20:52.509 --> 00:20:57.491
but for p you put the
allowed value which is

00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:00.980
2Πâ„ /L times
m.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.509
And what do you get?
 

00:21:02.509 --> 00:21:16.778
You get 1/√L times
e^(2Πimx/L).

00:21:16.778 --> 00:21:18.901
They're all oscillating
exponentials,

00:21:18.901 --> 00:21:22.317
but you realize that the label
p and the label m are

00:21:22.317 --> 00:21:23.318
equally good.
 

00:21:23.318 --> 00:21:25.940
If I tell you what m is
you know what the momentum is

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.848
because you just multiply by
this number.

00:21:27.848 --> 00:21:32.259
So quite often I'll refer to
this wave function by this label

00:21:32.259 --> 00:21:35.420
m which is as good as the label
p.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.396
The nice thing about the label
m is that m ranges

00:21:39.396 --> 00:21:40.680
over all integers.
 

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.088
p is a little more
complicated.

00:21:42.088 --> 00:21:45.992
p is also quantized,
but the allowed values are not

00:21:45.992 --> 00:21:49.348
integers, but integers times
this funny number.

00:21:49.348 --> 00:21:50.450
In the limit in which L
is very,

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:52.798
very large, compared to
ℏ,

00:21:52.798 --> 00:21:55.279
the spacing between the allowed
values becomes very,

00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:59.766
very close, and you may not
even realize that p is

00:21:59.766 --> 00:22:02.170
taking only discrete values.
 

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.535
So when you do a microscopic
problem where L is 1

00:22:04.535 --> 00:22:06.986
meter the spacing between one
allowed p and another

00:22:06.986 --> 00:22:09.480
allowed p will be so
small you won't notice it.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.695
So even if you lived in a real
ring of circumference 1 meter

00:22:12.695 --> 00:22:16.076
the momenta that you'll find in
the particle will look like any

00:22:16.076 --> 00:22:17.440
momentum is possible.
 

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.365
That's because the allowed
values of p of so densely

00:22:20.365 --> 00:22:22.027
close,
packed, that you don't know

00:22:22.027 --> 00:22:24.878
whether you've got this one,
or that one or something in

00:22:24.878 --> 00:22:27.618
between because you cannot
measure it that well.

00:22:27.618 --> 00:22:31.335
So it'll smoothly go into the
classical world of all allowed

00:22:31.335 --> 00:22:33.980
momenta if L becomes
macroscopic.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.630
And the notion of macroscopic
is " how big is big".

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.680
Well, it should be comparable
to ℏ.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:47.066
I mean, it should be much
bigger than ℏ then

00:22:47.066 --> 00:22:50.759
it'll become continuous.
 

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:54.980
So now I'm going to ask the
following question.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.779
If I have a particle in this
world,

00:22:58.779 --> 00:23:03.240
in this one-dimensional ring
and I plot the wave function,

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:11.401
some function ψ(x),
suppose it's not one of these

00:23:11.401 --> 00:23:12.539
functions?
 

00:23:12.539 --> 00:23:14.390
It's not e^(ipx/ℏ).
 

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.690
It's some random thing I wrote
here.

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:22.049
Of course it meets itself when
you go around a circle.

00:23:22.049 --> 00:23:23.490
That's a periodic function.
 

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:24.920
Be very careful.
 

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.280
A periodic function doesn't
mean it oscillates with a

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:27.690
period.
 

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:30.327
In this case periodic means
when I go around the loop it

00:23:30.327 --> 00:23:31.910
comes back to a starting value.
 

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:35.150
It doesn't do something like
this where the two don't match.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.680
That's what I mean by periodic.
 

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.710
It doesn't mean it's a nice
oscillatory function.

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.220
These guys are periodic and
oscillatory with the period.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.994
These are periodic only in the
sense that if you go around the

00:23:45.994 --> 00:23:48.680
ring you come back to the
starting value of the function.

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.674
So I give you some function
like this and I ask you what's

00:23:51.674 --> 00:23:52.990
going on with this guy.
 

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:56.509
What can you say about the
particle?

00:23:56.509 --> 00:24:01.281
So can you tell me anything now
given this function

00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:03.000
ψ(x)?
 

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.890
Does it tell you any
information?

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:12.030
You mean if I draw the function
like that, you get no

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:13.359
information from it.
 

00:24:13.359 --> 00:24:15.910
Is that what you're saying?
 

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.160
You must know--yes?
 

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.430
Student:  You square it
you get the probability

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.680
Prof: Yes, look.
 

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.430
If you knew that you've got to
say that because if I think that

00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:26.269
you didn't realize that I know
we are both in serious trouble.

00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:27.528
That's correct.
 

00:24:27.528 --> 00:24:29.828
I want to reinforce the notion
over and over again.

00:24:29.828 --> 00:24:31.868
Wave functions should tell you
something.

00:24:31.868 --> 00:24:34.098
Square it you get the
probability.

00:24:34.098 --> 00:24:36.006
If you don't square it don't
think it's the probability

00:24:36.006 --> 00:24:37.029
because it can be negative.
 

00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:38.690
It can even be complex.
 

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:41.400
So don't forget if you square
it you get the probability.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.558
Define a certain position.
 

00:24:43.558 --> 00:24:45.477
That means if you went around
with this little

00:24:45.477 --> 00:24:48.077
Heisenberg microscope
all over the ring and you catch

00:24:48.077 --> 00:24:49.577
it and you say,
"Good, I found it

00:24:49.577 --> 00:24:50.609
here," and you do that
many,

00:24:50.609 --> 00:24:51.980
many times.
 

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.328
By many, many times I mean you
take a million particles in a

00:24:55.328 --> 00:24:58.508
million rings each in exactly
this quantum state and make

00:24:58.508 --> 00:25:01.319
measurements,
then your histogram will look

00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:03.420
like the square of this
function.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.160
But there is more to life than
just saying,

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.157
"Where is the
particle?,"

00:25:07.157 --> 00:25:09.920
because in classical mechanics
you also ask,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.078
"What is its
momentum."

00:25:12.078 --> 00:25:16.432
The question I'm asking you is,
"What is the momentum you

00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:20.644
will get when you measure the
momentum of a particle in this

00:25:20.644 --> 00:25:21.930
quantum state?
 

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.960
You know the answer only on a
few special cases.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.973
If by luck your function
happened to look like one of

00:25:27.973 --> 00:25:31.104
these functions--right now I've
not told you what ψ

00:25:31.104 --> 00:25:31.509
is.
 

00:25:31.509 --> 00:25:34.000
It's whatever you like,
but if it looked like one of

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.635
these you're in good shape
because then the momentum is

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.589
whatever p you find up
here,

00:25:38.589 --> 00:25:40.049
but it may not look like that.
 

00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:42.730
This guy doesn't look like that.
 

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:47.051
So then the question is if you
measure momentum what answer

00:25:47.051 --> 00:25:48.170
will you get.
 

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:54.720
Now that is something--anybody
know what the answer is?

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.232
Now I accept your silence
because you're not supposed to

00:25:58.232 --> 00:25:59.000
know this.
 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.430
This is a postulate in quantum
mechanics.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:03.099
It's not logic.
 

00:26:03.099 --> 00:26:04.220
It's not mathematics.
 

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.717
No one could have told you 300
years ago this is the right

00:26:07.717 --> 00:26:08.269
answer.
 

00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:10.652
So this is another postulate
just like saying,

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:13.140
ψ^(2) is probability
defined at x.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.150
There is a new postulate.
 

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.220
It addresses the following
question.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.818
If I shift my attention from
position,

00:26:19.818 --> 00:26:23.074
to momentum,
and I ask, "What are the

00:26:23.074 --> 00:26:27.519
odds for getting different
answers for momentum?"

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:30.093
That answer's actually
contained in the same function

00:26:30.093 --> 00:26:32.318
ψ of x in the
following fashion.

00:26:32.318 --> 00:26:38.061
Take this function ψ(x)
and write it as a sum over

00:26:38.061 --> 00:26:43.567
p of these functions,
ψ_p of x

00:26:43.567 --> 00:26:47.420
with some coefficient
A_p.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.957
I can also write it equally
well as the same function

00:26:50.957 --> 00:26:55.038
labeled by integer m and I want
to call the coefficient m.

00:26:55.038 --> 00:26:59.171
They're exactly the same thing,
p and m are

00:26:59.171 --> 00:27:00.130
synonymous.
 

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.190
The same function.
 

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:06.425
This function is called
ψ_m because they

00:27:06.425 --> 00:27:11.068
contain the same information on
the momentum.

00:27:11.068 --> 00:27:14.291
So either you can write it this
way if you want to see the

00:27:14.291 --> 00:27:17.557
momentum highlighted,
or you can write the function

00:27:17.557 --> 00:27:21.700
this way if you want to see the
quantum number m highlighted,

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.048
but they stand for the same
physics.

00:27:24.048 --> 00:27:27.932
If m is equal to 4 it means the
cosine and the sine contained in

00:27:27.932 --> 00:27:31.875
the complex exponential finish 4
complete oscillations as they go

00:27:31.875 --> 00:27:33.170
around the cycle.
 

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:36.009
All right, so here's what
you're told.

00:27:36.009 --> 00:27:39.108
Take the arbitrary periodic
function.

00:27:39.108 --> 00:27:43.032
Write it as a sum of these
functions, each of definite

00:27:43.032 --> 00:27:45.548
momentum, with some coefficient.
 

00:27:45.548 --> 00:27:49.019
Then the probability that you
will get a momentum p

00:27:49.019 --> 00:27:51.483
when you measure it,
which is the same as the

00:27:51.483 --> 00:27:53.880
probability you will get the
corresponding m,

00:27:53.880 --> 00:28:07.980
is nothing but the absolute
square of this coefficient.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.789
In other words,
anyway, this is a postulate.

00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:14.670
Let me repeat the postulate.
 

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.170
Somebody gives you a function.
 

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:20.009
You write the function as a sum
of all these periodic functions,

00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:23.751
each with the index m,
multiply each with a suitable

00:28:23.751 --> 00:28:27.429
number so that they add up to
give you the function that's

00:28:27.429 --> 00:28:28.720
provided to you.
 

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.880
Once you've done that the
coefficient squared with the

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.669
particular value m is the
probability you will get that

00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:41.279
value for m or the corresponding
momentum.

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.930
So there are two questions one
can ask at this point.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.797
First question is what makes
you think that you can write any

00:28:47.797 --> 00:28:51.019
function I give you as a sum of
these functions.

00:28:51.019 --> 00:28:52.058
Realize what this means.
 

00:28:52.058 --> 00:28:55.847
I'm saying I can write any
function as

00:28:55.847 --> 00:29:01.890
e^(2Πimx/L)√L
times A_m.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:05.848
I'm writing out this function
explicitly for you.

00:29:05.848 --> 00:29:09.269
Now that is a mathematical
result I will not prove here,

00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:13.106
it's called Fourier series and
it tells you that every periodic

00:29:13.106 --> 00:29:15.299
function,
namely that which comes back to

00:29:15.299 --> 00:29:17.778
itself when you go around a
period length L,

00:29:17.778 --> 00:29:21.380
can be written as a sum of
these periodic functions with

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.410
suitably chosen coefficients.
 

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:31.420
It can always be done.
 

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.798
That is analogous to the
statement that if you are say

00:29:34.798 --> 00:29:38.048
living in three dimensions and
there is a vector

00:29:38.048 --> 00:29:41.467
V, and you pick for
yourself three

00:29:41.467 --> 00:29:44.970
orthonormal
vectors,

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:48.317
i, j and
k, then any vector

00:29:48.317 --> 00:29:52.022
V can be written as
V_x times

00:29:52.022 --> 00:29:55.156
i V_y
times j 

00:29:55.156 --> 00:29:58.150
V_z times
k.

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:00.074
In other words,
I challenge you to write any

00:30:00.074 --> 00:30:02.446
arrow in three dimensions
starting from the origin and

00:30:02.446 --> 00:30:04.730
pointing in any direction of any
finite length.

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.708
I'll build it up for you using
some multiple of i,

00:30:07.708 --> 00:30:09.890
some of j,
and some of k.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:11.269
We know that can be done in
fact.

00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:12.904
That's if you want the
technical definition of

00:30:12.904 --> 00:30:13.559
three-dimension.
 

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:14.269
Yes?
 

00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:18.643
Student:  With the
Fourier case would there be one

00:30:18.643 --> 00:30:21.220
unique way of writing ________?
 

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.740
Prof: Good point.
 

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.319
That's correct.
 

00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:23.029
There will be a unique way.
 

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.670
Student:  There is?
 

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:24.548
Prof: There is.
 

00:30:24.548 --> 00:30:28.845
You agree in three dimensions
there is no other mixture except

00:30:28.845 --> 00:30:29.618
this one.
 

00:30:29.618 --> 00:30:33.059
If somebody comes with the
second way of writing it you can

00:30:33.059 --> 00:30:36.618
show that the second way will
coincide with the first way.

00:30:36.618 --> 00:30:40.038
So the expansion of a function,
in what are called these

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:43.582
trigonometric or exponential
functions and it's called the

00:30:43.582 --> 00:30:46.930
Fourier series of the function,
has unique coefficients.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.295
And I'll tell you right now
what the formula for the

00:30:49.295 --> 00:30:51.646
coefficient is,
but first I'm telling you that

00:30:51.646 --> 00:30:54.682
just like it's natural to build
a vector out of some building

00:30:54.682 --> 00:30:56.438
blocks
i, j and

00:30:56.438 --> 00:31:00.012
k, it's natural to build
up periodic functions with these

00:31:00.012 --> 00:31:02.338
building blocks the
ψ_m.

00:31:02.338 --> 00:31:05.548
The only difference is there
you need only three guys.

00:31:05.548 --> 00:31:08.814
Here you need an infinite
number of them because a range

00:31:08.814 --> 00:31:12.019
of m goes from minus to plus
infinity, all integers.

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:14.949
But it's still remarkable that
given all of them you can build

00:31:14.949 --> 00:31:17.671
any function you like,
including this thing I just

00:31:17.671 --> 00:31:21.140
wrote down arbitrarily,
can be built.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.088
The fact that you can prove it,
that you can do it,

00:31:23.088 --> 00:31:25.240
I don't want to prove because
it's kind of tricky,

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:30.063
but I will prove the second
part of it which is given that

00:31:30.063 --> 00:31:35.309
such an expansion exists how do
I find these coefficients given

00:31:35.309 --> 00:31:36.578
a function?
 

00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:42.140
So let's ask a similar question
in the usual case of vectors.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.318
How do I find the coefficients?
 

00:31:45.318 --> 00:31:48.390
Suppose I write the vector
V as e_1

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.194
times V_1 
e_2 times

00:31:51.194 --> 00:31:53.630
V_2
e_3 times

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:55.058
V_3.
 

00:31:55.058 --> 00:31:55.858
Don't worry
e_1,

00:31:55.858 --> 00:31:57.160
e_2 and
e_3 are the

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.773
usual guys,
e_1 is

00:31:58.773 --> 00:32:01.148
i, e_2
is j and

00:32:01.148 --> 00:32:03.048
e_3 is
k.

00:32:03.048 --> 00:32:08.730
People like to do that because
in mathematics you may want to

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:12.305
go to 96 dimensions,
but we've only got 26 letters,

00:32:12.305 --> 00:32:14.501
so if you stuck to i,
j and k you're

00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:17.106
going to have trouble,
but with numbers you never run

00:32:17.106 --> 00:32:18.130
out of numbers.
 

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.345
So you label all the dimensions
by some number,

00:32:21.345 --> 00:32:24.630
which in this case happens to
go from 1 to 3.

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.205
You also know that these
vectors i and j

00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:29.003
have some very interesting
properties,

00:32:29.003 --> 00:32:30.900
i⋅i is
1.

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.009
That's the same as
j⋅j.

00:32:33.009 --> 00:32:35.019
That's the same as
k⋅k.

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:37.323
And that
i⋅k

00:32:37.323 --> 00:32:39.315
and
i⋅j

00:32:39.315 --> 00:32:40.558
are 0 and so on.
 

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:44.198
Namely the dot product of one
guy with himself is 1,

00:32:44.198 --> 00:32:46.910
and any one with anything else
is 0.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.674
That just tells you they all
have unit length and they're

00:32:49.674 --> 00:32:50.910
mutually perpendicular.
 

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.372
I want to write this as
e_i

00:32:53.372 --> 00:32:55.771
⋅
e_j,

00:32:55.771 --> 00:32:57.730
but this could be 1,2 or 3.
 

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:59.078
That could be 1,2 or 3.
 

00:32:59.078 --> 00:33:02.278
I want to say this is equal to
1 if i is equal to

00:33:02.278 --> 00:33:02.920
j.
 

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.046
This is equal to 0 if
i is not equal to

00:33:07.046 --> 00:33:07.920
j.
 

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:09.900
This is a usual vector analysis.
 

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.210
I'm just saying the dot product
of basis vectors has this

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.972
property,
1 if they match,

00:33:14.972 --> 00:33:18.374
2 if they're different,
so there's a shortcut for this

00:33:18.374 --> 00:33:21.592
and that's write the symbol
δ_ij.

00:33:21.592 --> 00:33:24.925
δ_ij is
called Kronecker's

00:33:24.925 --> 00:33:25.568
delta.
 

00:33:25.568 --> 00:33:30.828
Kronecker's in a lot of things,
but this is one place where his

00:33:30.828 --> 00:33:33.288
name has been immortalized.
 

00:33:33.288 --> 00:33:35.769
He just said instead of saying
this all the time,

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:37.380
1 if they're equal,
0 if they're different,

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.290
why don't you call it my
symbol, the Kronecker's symbol,

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:41.880
δ_ij.
 

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.798
It's understood that this whole
thing simply says

00:33:44.798 --> 00:33:46.501
δ_ij.
 

00:33:46.501 --> 00:33:47.779
This is shorthand.
 

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:50.499
That means if on the left hand
side there are two guys with

00:33:50.499 --> 00:33:53.452
indices i and j if
the indices are equal the right

00:33:53.452 --> 00:33:56.160
hand side is 1,
indices are unequal right hand

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.808
side is 0.
 

00:33:56.808 --> 00:34:00.425
Do you understand that this
gives you the fact that each

00:34:00.425 --> 00:34:04.239
vector is of length 1 and that
each is perpendicular to the

00:34:04.239 --> 00:34:05.160
other two.
 

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.400
Now that is what we can use now
to find out.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.782
So let me write the vector
V in this notation as

00:34:12.782 --> 00:34:16.353
e_i times
V_ii from 1 to

00:34:16.353 --> 00:34:16.730
3.
 

00:34:16.730 --> 00:34:21.050
You're all familiar with this
way to write the sum?

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:23.409
So I come with a certain vector.
 

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:25.030
The vector is not defined in
any axis.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.650
It's just an arrow pointing in
some direction.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.460
It's got a magnitude and
direction.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.844
And I say, "Can you write
the vector in terms of i,

00:34:31.844 --> 00:34:33.000
j and k?"
 

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.938
And the answer is,
"Yes, of course I

00:34:34.938 --> 00:34:35.519
can."
 

00:34:35.519 --> 00:34:37.610
So here's your vector V.
 

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.476
Here is, if you like,
e_1,

00:34:39.476 --> 00:34:41.610
e_2 and
e_3.

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:42.960
The claim is some mixture of
e_1,

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.338
e_2,
e_3 will add

00:34:44.338 --> 00:34:45.000
up to this V.
 

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.070
That's granted, but how much?
 

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.110
How much e_1
do I need?

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:49.599
How much e_2
do I need?

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:52.429
There's a very simple trick for
that.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:54.719
Anybody know what that trick is?
 

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:59.159
You might know that trick.
 

00:34:59.159 --> 00:35:03.550
You've seen it anywhere?
 

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:05.179
Here is the trick.
 

00:35:05.179 --> 00:35:08.889
Suppose you want to find
V_2?

00:35:08.889 --> 00:35:11.503
You take the dot product of
both these things with

00:35:11.503 --> 00:35:12.730
e_2.
 

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:17.175
Take e_2 dot
this, and take dot product with

00:35:17.175 --> 00:35:18.880
e_2.
 

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.909
What happens is you will
get--the dot product can go

00:35:22.909 --> 00:35:23.619
inside.
 

00:35:23.619 --> 00:35:25.875
You'll get e_i
⋅

00:35:25.875 --> 00:35:28.541
e_2 times
V_i where

00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:30.079
i goes from 1 to 3.
 

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:31.603
What is e_i
⋅

00:35:31.603 --> 00:35:32.460
e_2?
 

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:32.956
e_i
⋅

00:35:32.956 --> 00:35:33.768
e_2 is
δ_i2.

00:35:33.768 --> 00:35:39.909
That means if this index size
is equal to 2 you get 1.

00:35:39.909 --> 00:35:41.719
If not equal to 0 you strike
out.

00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:43.389
You get 0.
 

00:35:43.389 --> 00:35:46.510
So of all the three terms in
this only one will survive.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.525
That's the one when i is
equal to 2 in which case you

00:35:49.525 --> 00:35:50.190
will get 1.
 

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:53.925
That's multiplying
V_2 so it'll

00:35:53.925 --> 00:35:56.469
give you V_2.
 

00:35:56.469 --> 00:36:00.606
So to find the component number
3 you take the dot product of

00:36:00.606 --> 00:36:03.780
the given vector with
e_3,

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.590
and that will give you,
you can see,

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.865
that will give you
V_3 or

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:10.309
V_2 or whatever
you like.

00:36:10.309 --> 00:36:15.429
I'm going to use a similar
trick now in our problem.

00:36:15.429 --> 00:36:17.670
The trick I'm going to use is
the following.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:23.096
So the analogy is just like you
had V = sum over i

00:36:23.096 --> 00:36:27.489
e_i times
V_i,

00:36:27.489 --> 00:36:30.346
I have ψ
of x is equal to sum

00:36:30.346 --> 00:36:34.079
over m of some
A_m times the

00:36:34.079 --> 00:36:37.230
function ψ_m of
x.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.860
You understand that?
 

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.938
ψ_m is a
particular function which I

00:36:39.938 --> 00:36:44.846
don't want to write every time,
but if you insist it is

00:36:44.846 --> 00:36:51.780
2Πimx/L divided by
√L.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.619
So I'm trying to find this guy.
 

00:36:54.619 --> 00:36:55.539
How much is it?
 

00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:57.280
That's the question.
 

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.610
Now here we had a nice rule.
 

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:01.960
The rule says e_i
⋅

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:04.659
e_j is
δ_ij.

00:37:04.659 --> 00:37:07.989
That was helpful in finding the
coefficients.

00:37:07.989 --> 00:37:11.224
There's a similar rule on the
right hand side which I will

00:37:11.224 --> 00:37:13.780
show you and we can all verify
it together.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.869
The claim is
ψ_m*(x)

00:37:18.869 --> 00:37:23.818
times
ψ_n(x) dx

00:37:23.818 --> 00:37:32.159
from 0 to L is in
fact δ_mn.

00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:36.405
So the basis vectors
ψ_m are like

00:37:36.405 --> 00:37:38.530
e_i.
 

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.248
The dot product of two basis
vectors being

00:37:40.248 --> 00:37:42.260
δ_ij is
the same here,

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.114
like same integral,
but one of them star times the

00:37:46.114 --> 00:37:50.913
other one is 1 if it's the same
function and 0 if it's not the

00:37:50.913 --> 00:37:52.329
same function.
 

00:37:52.329 --> 00:37:54.599
Let's see if this is true.
 

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:57.440
If m is equal to
n, can you do this in

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.110
your head?
 

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:02.260
If m is equal to
n what do we have?

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:05.739
This number times this
conjugate is just 1.

00:38:05.739 --> 00:38:07.630
You just get 1/L.
 

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:11.125
An integral of 1/L dx,
so if you want I will write it

00:38:11.125 --> 00:38:16.864
here,
it's 2Πi times

00:38:16.864 --> 00:38:28.050
n −mx/L dx
from 0 to L.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.389
Do you understand that?
 

00:38:29.389 --> 00:38:31.530
You take the conjugate of the
first function.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:34.864
That where's it's a -m here,
and take the second function

00:38:34.864 --> 00:38:37.128
which is
e^(2Πin)^(/L)

00:38:37.128 --> 00:38:38.260
times x.
 

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:42.030
I'll wait until you have time
to digest that.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.123
The product of
ψ_m* with

00:38:44.123 --> 00:38:47.179
ψ_n you combine
the two exponentials,

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:50.458
but the thing that had m
in it has a -m here

00:38:50.458 --> 00:38:52.530
because you conjugated
everything.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.329
So I'm saying,
"What is the integral

00:38:54.329 --> 00:38:55.230
going to be?"
 

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.289
If n is equal to
m you can see that in

00:38:58.289 --> 00:38:59.010
your head.
 

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.409
This is e^(0).
 

00:39:01.409 --> 00:39:02.949
That is just 1.
 

00:39:02.949 --> 00:39:04.300
The integral of dx is
L.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.380
That cancels the L.
 

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.820
You get 1.
 

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.320
That's certainly true if
m is equal to n.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.739
If m is not equal to
n, suppose it is 6?

00:39:15.739 --> 00:39:17.599
It doesn't matter.
 

00:39:17.599 --> 00:39:21.440
This will complete 6 full
oscillations in the period,

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:24.809
the sine and the cosine,
but whenever you integrate a

00:39:24.809 --> 00:39:28.440
sine or a cosine over some
number of full periods you get

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:28.829
0.
 

00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:32.853
So this exponential,
when integrated over a full

00:39:32.853 --> 00:39:37.905
cycle, if it's got a non-zero
exponent integer exponent will

00:39:37.905 --> 00:39:39.190
give you 0.
 

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:43.302
So you see the remarkable
similarity between usual vector

00:39:43.302 --> 00:39:45.579
analysis and these functions.
 

00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:47.050
This is an arbitrary vector.
 

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:49.369
This is an arbitrary function.
 

00:39:49.369 --> 00:39:50.898
e_1,
e_2,

00:39:50.898 --> 00:39:52.389
e_3 are basis
vectors;

00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:55.360
ψ_m are if you
want basis function.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.219
I can build any vector out of
these unit vectors.

00:39:58.219 --> 00:40:01.440
I can build any function out of
these basis functions.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.557
And finally,
if I want to find out a

00:40:04.557 --> 00:40:07.409
coefficient, what should I do?
 

00:40:07.409 --> 00:40:08.574
You want to find the
coefficient

00:40:08.574 --> 00:40:09.440
A_n.
 

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:14.329
What did I do here to find
V_j?

00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:17.717
You take V⋅
e_j where

00:40:17.717 --> 00:40:20.559
j could be whatever
number you picked.

00:40:20.559 --> 00:40:23.168
Because if you take the dot
product of the two sides when

00:40:23.168 --> 00:40:25.590
you take dot product of
e_j the only

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.360
term who survives is i =
j.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:28.679
That'll give you the
V_j.

00:40:28.679 --> 00:40:32.199
So similarly here I claim the
following is true.

00:40:32.199 --> 00:40:37.766
If you do the integral of
ψ_n* x

00:40:37.766 --> 00:40:43.760
times the given function
dx from 0 to L you

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.400
will get A_n.
 

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.530
So once I show this I'm done.
 

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.405
Now if you don't have the
stomach for this proof you don't

00:40:51.405 --> 00:40:52.920
have to remember this proof.
 

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.809
That's up to you.
 

00:40:53.809 --> 00:40:56.719
See, I don't know how much you
guys want to know.

00:40:56.719 --> 00:40:59.518
I'm trying to keep the stuff I
just tell you without proof to a

00:40:59.518 --> 00:40:59.969
minimum.
 

00:40:59.969 --> 00:41:03.059
I felt bad telling you that
every function can be expanded

00:41:03.059 --> 00:41:04.851
this way,
but the coefficients being

00:41:04.851 --> 00:41:06.739
given by the formula is not too
far away,

00:41:06.739 --> 00:41:09.440
so I want to show you how it's
done.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.639
You may not know the details
why this is working,

00:41:12.639 --> 00:41:15.474
but you should certainly know
that if you want coefficient

00:41:15.474 --> 00:41:18.460
number 13 you've got to take
ψ_13* and multiply

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.550
with the given function and
integrate.

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.159
That you're supposed to know,
so why does this work?

00:41:24.159 --> 00:41:26.190
So let's see what this does.
 

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:30.409
We are trying to take
ψ_n*(x).

00:41:30.409 --> 00:41:35.724
The given function looks like a
sum A_m

00:41:35.724 --> 00:41:41.875
ψ_m(x)
dx 0 to L summed over

00:41:41.875 --> 00:41:43.230
m.
 

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.742
So this summation you see you
can bring the ψ

00:41:47.742 --> 00:41:49.809
in here if you like.
 

00:41:49.809 --> 00:41:52.530
It doesn't matter.
 

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.572
Then do the integral over
x then you will find this

00:41:56.572 --> 00:41:59.480
is giving me--maybe I'll write
it here.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.514
That is going to be equal to
sum over m

00:42:03.514 --> 00:42:07.371
A_m of
ψ_m of

00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:12.215
ψ_n* x
ψ_m(x)

00:42:12.215 --> 00:42:14.974
dx,
and that is going to be

00:42:14.974 --> 00:42:16.530
δ_mn.
 

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:19.737
That means I will vanish unless
m equals n,

00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:22.829
and when m equals
n I will give you 1.

00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:25.697
That means the only term that
survives from all these terms is

00:42:25.697 --> 00:42:27.719
the one where m matches
n,

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:39.639
so the thing that comes out is
A_n.

00:42:39.639 --> 00:42:45.338
Once again, you will see this
in my notes, but do you have any

00:42:45.338 --> 00:42:49.449
idea of what I did or where this
is going?

00:42:49.449 --> 00:42:53.186
In quantum theory if you want
to know what'll happen if I

00:42:53.186 --> 00:42:57.123
measure momentum for a particle
living in a ring you have to

00:42:57.123 --> 00:43:01.061
write the given function in
terms of these special functions

00:43:01.061 --> 00:43:04.597
each item defined as a definite
momentum with suitable

00:43:04.597 --> 00:43:06.000
coefficients.
 

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.233
The rule for finding
coefficient A_n

00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:14.059
is to do this integral of
ψ_n*.

00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:15.840
This one, this is the rule.
 

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.699
A_n is the
integral of

00:43:18.699 --> 00:43:21.409
ψ_n*ψ
dx.

00:43:21.409 --> 00:43:25.297
And once you found the
coefficients for all possible

00:43:25.297 --> 00:43:29.474
n then the probability that
you will have some momentum

00:43:29.474 --> 00:43:34.010
corresponding to m is
just A_m^(2).

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.090
That is a recipe.
 

00:43:35.090 --> 00:43:38.518
What the recipe tells you is if
your function is made up as a

00:43:38.518 --> 00:43:42.117
special function with a definite
momentum of course you will get

00:43:42.117 --> 00:43:45.090
that momentum as the answer when
you measure it.

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:49.353
If your function is a sum over
many different momentum

00:43:49.353 --> 00:43:54.179
functions then you can get any
of the answers in the sum,

00:43:54.179 --> 00:43:57.135
but if it had a big coefficient
in the expansion is more likely

00:43:57.135 --> 00:43:58.090
to be that answer.
 

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:00.460
If it had a small coefficient
it's less likely.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:05.300
If it had no coefficient you
won't get that momentum at all.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.298
That's like saying if you had
ψ(x) it's likely

00:44:08.298 --> 00:44:10.655
where it's big,
unlikely where it's small and

00:44:10.655 --> 00:44:12.210
impossible where it is 0.
 

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:13.280
So that's your job.
 

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.827
Anytime someone gives you a
function you have to find these

00:44:15.827 --> 00:44:17.672
coefficients
A_n then look

00:44:17.672 --> 00:44:18.199
at them.
 

00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:20.340
They'll tell you what the
answer is.

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.579
So that's what I'm going to do
now.

00:44:21.579 --> 00:44:26.248
I'm going to take some trial
functions and go through this

00:44:26.248 --> 00:44:30.835
machinery of finding the
coefficients and reading off the

00:44:30.835 --> 00:44:31.820
answers.
 

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:37.059
So maybe if I do an example
you'll see where this is going.

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:41.536
So let's take an example where
I'm going to pick first of all a

00:44:41.536 --> 00:44:45.869
very benign function then maybe
a more difficult function.

00:44:45.869 --> 00:44:51.460
The function I want to pick is
this.

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:56.873
Some number n cosine
6Πx/L,

00:44:56.873 --> 00:45:01.280
somebody gives you that
function.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:04.394
That is not a state of definite
momentum because it is not

00:45:04.394 --> 00:45:06.909
e to the i
something x.

00:45:06.909 --> 00:45:09.465
So we already know when you
measure momentum you won't get a

00:45:09.465 --> 00:45:10.159
unique answer.
 

00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:12.929
You'll get many answers,
but what are the many answers?

00:45:12.929 --> 00:45:18.010
What are the many odds is what
we're asking.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:21.739
I forgot to mention one thing
in my postulate.

00:45:21.739 --> 00:45:25.954
What I forgot to mention is
that for all this to be true it

00:45:25.954 --> 00:45:29.974
is important that the functions,
the momentum functions,

00:45:29.974 --> 00:45:33.052
are all normalized and the
given function is also

00:45:33.052 --> 00:45:33.949
normalized.
 

00:45:33.949 --> 00:45:37.045
You should first normalize your
function then expand it in terms

00:45:37.045 --> 00:45:39.650
of these normalized functions of
definite momentum.

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:42.706
Only then the squares of the
coefficient are the absolute

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:43.579
probabilities.
 

00:45:43.579 --> 00:45:46.800
By that I mean if you do this
calculation,

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.809
and you then went and added all
these A_m_

00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:55.365
squares,
you will find amazingly it adds

00:45:55.365 --> 00:45:56.369
up to 1.
 

00:45:56.369 --> 00:46:00.289
Because you can show
mathematically that if

00:46:00.289 --> 00:46:05.889
ψ*ψ dx is 1 then
the coefficients of expansion

00:46:05.889 --> 00:46:08.409
squared will also be 1.
 

00:46:08.409 --> 00:46:11.523
So if you took a normalized
ψ then the probabilities you

00:46:11.523 --> 00:46:14.849
get are absolute probabilities
because they will add up to 1.

00:46:14.849 --> 00:46:21.809
There's also a mathematical
result which I am not showing.

00:46:21.809 --> 00:46:23.860
All right, so let's go to this
problem.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:28.139
So the first job is,
normalize your ψ.

00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:30.960
So how to normalize this
function I'm going to demand

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.619
that if you square ψ
and you integrate it,

00:46:33.619 --> 00:46:40.969
so I say N^(2) times
integral of cosine square as

00:46:40.969 --> 00:46:47.920
6Πx/L dx from 0 to
L should be 1.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:51.376
Now you don't have to look up
the table of integrals because

00:46:51.376 --> 00:46:54.655
when you take a cosine squared
or a sine squared over any

00:46:54.655 --> 00:46:57.820
number of full cycles the
average value is a half.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:02.818
That means over the length
L this integral will be

00:47:02.818 --> 00:47:03.980
L/2.
 

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:08.702
So you want N^(2)L/2 to
be 1 or you want n to be square

00:47:08.702 --> 00:47:10.329
root of 2/L.
 

00:47:10.329 --> 00:47:18.472
So the normalized function
looks like square root of

00:47:18.472 --> 00:47:24.219
2/L cosine
6Πx/L.

00:47:24.219 --> 00:47:27.079
So that's the first job.
 

00:47:27.079 --> 00:47:30.702
Second is you can ask now what
are the coefficients

00:47:30.702 --> 00:47:32.369
A_n.
 

00:47:32.369 --> 00:47:38.108
So A_n is
going to be integral

00:47:38.108 --> 00:47:43.847
1/√L
e^(-2Πinx/L)

00:47:43.847 --> 00:47:51.708
times this function square root
of 2/L cosine 6Πx/L

00:47:51.708 --> 00:47:53.329
dx.
 

00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.960
Are you with me?
 

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:55.059
That's the rule.
 

00:47:55.059 --> 00:47:56.820
Take the function,
multiply it by

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.255
ψ_n*,
which is this guy here,

00:48:00.255 --> 00:48:04.547
this is the ψ_n*,
this is the ψ

00:48:04.547 --> 00:48:07.233
that's given to you,
and you're integrating the

00:48:07.233 --> 00:48:08.449
product in the integral.
 

00:48:08.449 --> 00:48:10.309
That'll give you
A_n.

00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:13.710
But I claim,
yeah, if you want you can do

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.454
this integrals,
but I think there's a quicker

00:48:17.454 --> 00:48:19.070
way to do that.
 

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:23.204
Have any idea of what the
quicker way just by looking at

00:48:23.204 --> 00:48:23.579
it?
 

00:48:23.579 --> 00:48:25.925
In other words,
if you can guess the expansion

00:48:25.925 --> 00:48:27.280
I'll say I will take it.
 

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:35.695
Can you guess what the answer
looks like without doing the

00:48:35.695 --> 00:48:36.730
work?
 

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:41.501
In other words I want you to
write this function as a sum

00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:45.079
over exponentials just by
looking at it.

00:48:45.079 --> 00:48:49.039
Can you tell me what it is?
 

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:54.018
I want you to write it in the
form sum over m

00:48:54.018 --> 00:48:57.730
A_m
e^(2Πimx/L).

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:01.987
You can find the
A_m by doing

00:49:01.987 --> 00:49:06.717
all this nasty work,
but I'm saying in this problem

00:49:06.717 --> 00:49:09.650
there's a much quicker way.
 

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:14.199
You see it anywhere?
 

00:49:14.199 --> 00:49:17.958
What's the relation between
trigonometric functions and

00:49:17.958 --> 00:49:19.630
exponential functions?
 

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:20.260
Yep?
 

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:21.980
Student:  Euler's
formula?

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:22.880
Prof: And what does it
say?

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.675
Student:  e^(ix)
= cosine x i sine

00:49:27.675 --> 00:49:28.539
x.
 

00:49:28.539 --> 00:49:31.351
Prof: Yes,
but now I want to go the other

00:49:31.351 --> 00:49:31.710
way.
 

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:34.139
It is certainly true that
cosine θ,

00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:37.985
I'm sorry, e^(iθ)
is cosine θ

00:49:37.985 --> 00:49:39.949
I sine θ.
 

00:49:39.949 --> 00:49:44.050
I told you, you forget the
formula at your own peril.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:48.896
The conjugate of that is
e^(-iθ) is cosine

00:49:48.896 --> 00:49:51.860
θ -i sine θ.
 

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:56.143
If you add these two you'll
find cosine θ

00:49:56.143 --> 00:50:00.239
is (e^(iθ)
e^(-iθ))/2,

00:50:00.239 --> 00:50:04.965
and if you subtract them and
divide by 2i you'll find

00:50:04.965 --> 00:50:08.809
sine θ is e to the minus
over 2i.

00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:12.920
I wanted you to be familiar
with complex numbers enough so

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:17.103
that when you see a cosine the
two exponentials jump out at

00:50:17.103 --> 00:50:17.679
you.
 

00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:20.398
Otherwise you will be doing all
these hard integrals that you

00:50:20.398 --> 00:50:21.260
don't have to do.
 

00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:25.809
That's like saying sine squared
cosine squared is 1,

00:50:25.809 --> 00:50:28.219
but you don't look it up.
 

00:50:28.219 --> 00:50:29.329
That's something you know.
 

00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:32.003
What you look up is your Social
Security number or mother's

00:50:32.003 --> 00:50:32.650
maiden name.
 

00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:34.460
You're allowed to forget those
things.

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:35.969
You look in a book.
 

00:50:35.969 --> 00:50:37.230
That's the name.
 

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:40.347
But this you have to know
because you cannot go anywhere

00:50:40.347 --> 00:50:43.579
without this because if you
don't know it all the time you

00:50:43.579 --> 00:50:46.302
must have done these
trigonometry calculations in

00:50:46.302 --> 00:50:47.039
school.
 

00:50:47.039 --> 00:50:49.536
You've got to plug in the right
stuff at the right time for

00:50:49.536 --> 00:50:50.699
things to all cancel out.
 

00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:51.992
You cannot say,
"I will look it up,"

00:50:51.992 --> 00:50:53.170
because you don't know what to
look up.

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:58.480
So everything should be in your
head, and the minimum you should

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.840
know is this,
the minimum.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:09.804
Therefore, I can come to this
function here and I can write it

00:51:09.804 --> 00:51:13.338
in terms of--
what I'm telling you is

00:51:13.338 --> 00:51:16.599
ψ(x),
which was given to us,

00:51:16.599 --> 00:51:21.951
is equal to the square root of
2/L times cosine

00:51:21.951 --> 00:51:29.532
6Πx/L,
but I'm going to write it as

00:51:29.532 --> 00:51:41.452
square root of 2/L times
½e^(6Πix/L) 

00:51:41.452 --> 00:51:46.420
e^(-6Πix/L).
 

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:53.130
So that I will write it very
explicitly as 1/√2 times

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:59.958
e^(6Πix/L)/√L 
(1/√2)e^(-6Πix/L)

00:51:59.958 --> 00:52:04.010
divided by √L.
 

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:08.081
In other words,
what I've done is rather than

00:52:08.081 --> 00:52:13.726
doing integrals I just massaged
the given function and managed

00:52:13.726 --> 00:52:18.539
to write it as a sum over
normalized functions,

00:52:18.539 --> 00:52:22.579
as I said, with definite
momentum with some coefficients.

00:52:22.579 --> 00:52:25.123
In other words,
here it is in the form that we

00:52:25.123 --> 00:52:25.518
want.
 

00:52:25.518 --> 00:52:34.739
A_m
e^(2Πimx/L).

00:52:34.739 --> 00:52:39.280
You agree that I have got it to
the form I want?

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.670
You see that?
 

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:43.695
You take the cosine,
write it as sum of

00:52:43.695 --> 00:52:45.920
exponentials,
then put factors of

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.670
√L so that that's a
normalized function,

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:52.724
and that's a normalized
function, and everybody else is

00:52:52.724 --> 00:52:53.550
A.
 

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:56.150
So what do you find here?
 

00:52:56.150 --> 00:53:00.039
What are the A's for
this problem?

00:53:00.039 --> 00:53:03.423
By comparing the two what do
you find are the A's in

00:53:03.423 --> 00:53:04.300
this problem?
 

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.530
What is A_14?
 

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.909
Let me ask you this.
 

00:53:09.909 --> 00:53:16.889
If you compare this to this one
what m are you getting?

00:53:16.889 --> 00:53:19.300
Do that in your head.
 

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:27.489
If you compare this to this one
what is m?

00:53:27.489 --> 00:53:29.460
Student:  3.
 

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:29.829
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:30.300
Student:  3.
 

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.280
Prof: m is 3 for this
guy,

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.130
so this is really
ψ_3 and this is

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:42.320
ψ_-3 because you
can see there are two momenta in

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.659
the problem.
 

00:53:43.659 --> 00:53:46.539
And you can stare at them,
you can see right away.

00:53:46.539 --> 00:53:51.817
Therefore, A_3
is 1/√2,

00:53:51.817 --> 00:53:57.329
and A_-3 is
also 1/√2.

00:53:57.329 --> 00:54:03.036
Therefore, the probability for
m = 3 is ½,

00:54:03.036 --> 00:54:10.409
and the probability for m = -3
is ½ and nothing else.

00:54:10.409 --> 00:54:19.909
All other A's are 0
because they don't have a role.

00:54:19.909 --> 00:54:22.550
So you might think every term
must appear.

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:23.420
It need not.
 

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.440
So this is a good example that
tells you only two of the m's

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.690
make it to the final summation.
 

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:33.103
All the other m's are 0 and
they happen to come with equal

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:34.900
coefficients,
1 over root 2.

00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.697
The square of that is 1 over 2,
and you can see these

00:54:37.697 --> 00:54:39.579
probabilities nicely add up to
1.

00:54:39.579 --> 00:54:43.092
I told you if you normalize the
initial function the probability

00:54:43.092 --> 00:54:44.989
for everything will add up to 1.
 

00:54:44.989 --> 00:54:47.210
So this is a particle.
 

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.590
If a particle is in a wave
function cosine 6Πx/L,

00:54:50.590 --> 00:54:54.487
which is a real wave function,
and you can plot that guy going

00:54:54.487 --> 00:54:57.135
around the circle,
it describes a particle whose

00:54:57.135 --> 00:54:58.724
momentum,
if you measure,

00:54:58.724 --> 00:55:01.349
will give you only 1 of 2
answers,

00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:09.614
m = 3 is p =
2Πâ„ /L times 3 or - 3

00:55:09.614 --> 00:55:14.460
plus or minus 6Πâ„ /L.
 

00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.349
You can see that too.
 

00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:17.070
I mean, just look at this
function.

00:55:17.070 --> 00:55:22.646
If you call it e^(ipx) p
is 6Πâ„ /L,

00:55:22.646 --> 00:55:28.436
so this particle has only two
possible answers when you

00:55:28.436 --> 00:55:30.690
measure momentum.
 

00:55:30.690 --> 00:55:34.043
So it is not as good as the
single exponential which has

00:55:34.043 --> 00:55:35.630
only one momentum in it.
 

00:55:35.630 --> 00:55:39.072
This is made up of two possible
momenta, but you won't get

00:55:39.072 --> 00:55:40.039
anything else.
 

00:55:40.039 --> 00:55:44.230
You will not get any other
momentum if you measure this.

00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:48.096
So if you got m = 14 as
a momentum there's something

00:55:48.096 --> 00:55:48.630
wrong.
 

00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:54.585
It's still probabilities,
but it tells you that there is

00:55:54.585 --> 00:55:58.809
non-0 probability only for these
two.

00:55:58.809 --> 00:56:02.300
Now in a minute I will take on
a more difficult problem where

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:05.860
you cannot look at the answer,
you cannot look at the function

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.929
ψ and just by fiddling with
it bring it to this form.

00:56:08.929 --> 00:56:09.610
You understand?
 

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:12.932
It is very fortunate for you
that I gave you cosine which is

00:56:12.932 --> 00:56:16.536
just the sum of two exponentials
so the two what are called plane

00:56:16.536 --> 00:56:20.030
wave exponentials are staring at
you and you pick them up.

00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:23.139
I can write other functions,
crazy functions for which you

00:56:23.139 --> 00:56:26.139
will have to do the integral to
find the coefficient.

00:56:26.139 --> 00:56:30.630
But I'm going to tell you one
other postulate of quantum

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:31.610
mechanics.
 

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:34.059
In the end I will assemble all
the postulates for you.

00:56:34.059 --> 00:56:35.710
I'm going to tell you one more
postulate.

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:39.110
It's called the measurement
postulate.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:44.250
The measurement postulate says
that if you make a measurement,

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:48.007
and you found the particle to
be at a certain location

00:56:48.007 --> 00:56:49.996
x,
then right after the

00:56:49.996 --> 00:56:53.574
measurement the wave function of
the particle will be a spike at

00:56:53.574 --> 00:56:56.699
the point x because you
know that you found it at

00:56:56.699 --> 00:57:00.164
x it means if that has
any meaning at all if you repeat

00:57:00.164 --> 00:57:03.516
the measurement immediately
afterwards you've got to get the

00:57:03.516 --> 00:57:04.710
same answer.
 

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:08.525
Therefore, your initial
function could have looked like

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:12.766
that, but after the measurement
it collapses to a function at

00:57:12.766 --> 00:57:15.099
the point where you found it.
 

00:57:15.099 --> 00:57:17.539
This is called the collapse of
the wave function.

00:57:17.539 --> 00:57:22.409
It goes from being able to be
found anywhere to being able to

00:57:22.409 --> 00:57:25.980
be found only where you found it
just now.

00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:28.030
It won't stay that way for
long, but right after

00:57:28.030 --> 00:57:29.559
measurement that's what it'll
be.

00:57:29.559 --> 00:57:32.996
But the state of the system
changes following the

00:57:32.996 --> 00:57:34.000
measurement.
 

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.697
And if you measured x
it'll turn into a wave

00:57:36.697 --> 00:57:39.559
function with well defined
x which we know is a

00:57:39.559 --> 00:57:42.420
spike at x equal to
wherever you found it.

00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:47.860
Similarly, if you measured
momentum and you found it at--

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.960
if you measure momentum,
first of all you'll get only

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:52.530
one of two answers,
m = 3 or m = -3.

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:56.264
If you got m = 3 the
state after the measurement will

00:57:56.264 --> 00:57:57.340
reduce to this.
 

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.500
This guy will be gone.
 

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:04.679
This will be the state.
 

00:58:04.679 --> 00:58:07.938
So from being able to have two
momenta which are equal and

00:58:07.938 --> 00:58:11.427
opposite the act of measurement
will force it to be one or the

00:58:11.427 --> 00:58:12.000
other.
 

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.280
It can give you either one,
but once you've got it that's

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:14.809
the answer.
 

00:58:14.809 --> 00:58:16.199
It's like the double slit.
 

00:58:16.199 --> 00:58:18.409
It can be here and it can be
there.

00:58:18.409 --> 00:58:20.766
It is not anywhere in
particular, but if you shine

00:58:20.766 --> 00:58:23.317
light and you catch it,
right after the measurement it

00:58:23.317 --> 00:58:25.289
is in front of one slit or the
other.

00:58:25.289 --> 00:58:26.929
Think of this as double slit.
 

00:58:26.929 --> 00:58:30.177
There's some probability for 3
and some for -3,

00:58:30.177 --> 00:58:33.989
but if you catch it at 3 it'll
collapse to this one.

00:58:33.989 --> 00:58:37.597
So what happens is in the sum
over many terms the answer will

00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:40.965
correspond to one of them,
and whichever one you got only

00:58:40.965 --> 00:58:42.768
that one term will remain.
 

00:58:42.768 --> 00:58:46.510
Everything will be deleted from
the wave function.

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:49.960
So the act of measurement
filters out from the sum,

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:53.630
the one term corresponding to
the one answer that you got,

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:57.980
this is called the collapse of
the wave function.

00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:01.481
So in classical mechanics when
you measure the position of a

00:59:01.481 --> 00:59:03.380
particle nothing much happens.
 

00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.704
It doesn't even know you
measured it because there are

00:59:05.704 --> 00:59:08.030
ways to measure it without
affecting it in any way.

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:10.925
So if had a momentum p
at a position x before

00:59:10.925 --> 00:59:13.822
the measurement it's the answer
right after the measurement

00:59:13.822 --> 00:59:16.219
because you can do noninvasive
measurements.

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:20.059
In quantum theory there are no
such measurements in general.

00:59:20.059 --> 00:59:23.451
In general the measurement will
change the wave function from

00:59:23.451 --> 00:59:26.730
being in one of many options to
the one option you got,

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:29.070
but the answer depends on what
you measure.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.043
With the same wave function on
a ring, let's say,

00:59:32.043 --> 00:59:35.697
if you measure position and you
found it here that'll be the

00:59:35.697 --> 00:59:36.380
answer.
 

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.306
If you measured momentum and
you got 5 it'll be something

00:59:40.306 --> 00:59:42.268
with 5 oscillations in it.
 

00:59:42.268 --> 00:59:44.882
So it'll collapse to that
particular function and what it

00:59:44.882 --> 00:59:46.889
collapses it depends on what you
measure.

00:59:46.889 --> 00:59:49.478
And for a long time I'm going
to focus only on x and

00:59:49.478 --> 00:59:49.969
p.
 

00:59:49.969 --> 00:59:51.952
Of course there are other
things you can measure and I

00:59:51.952 --> 00:59:53.300
don't want to go there right
now,

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:56.922
but if you measure x it
collapses to a spike at that

00:59:56.922 --> 00:59:57.610
location.
 

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:01.722
If you measure p it
collapses to the one term

01:00:01.722 --> 01:00:05.594
wherever that was,
that one e^(ipx) in the

01:00:05.594 --> 01:00:06.239
sum.
 

01:00:06.239 --> 01:00:09.820
So another interesting thing is
the only measurement,

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:13.885
only answers you will get in
the measurement are the allowed

01:00:13.885 --> 01:00:15.469
values of momentum.
 

01:00:15.469 --> 01:00:18.510
You'll never get a momentum
that's not allowed.

01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:22.125
And once you get one of the
allowed answers there are two

01:00:22.125 --> 01:00:23.739
things I'm telling you.
 

01:00:23.739 --> 01:00:27.731
One is the probability you will
get that answer is proportional

01:00:27.731 --> 01:00:31.079
to the square of that
coefficient in the expansion of

01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:32.559
the given function.
 

01:00:32.559 --> 01:00:35.110
In our problem there are only
two non-zero coefficients.

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:37.469
Both happen to be 1/√2.
 

01:00:37.469 --> 01:00:38.639
It happened to be an equal
mixture,

01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:41.306
but you can easily imagine some
other problem where this is

01:00:41.306 --> 01:00:42.900
1/√6,
and something that is

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.298
1/√6,
and something that is

01:00:44.298 --> 01:00:46.338
1/√3,
they should all add up to 1

01:00:46.338 --> 01:00:48.050
when you square and add them.
 

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:51.818
Then you can get all those
answers with those

01:00:51.818 --> 01:00:53.190
probabilities.
 

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:56.547
So the last thing I'm going to
do is just one more example of

01:00:56.547 --> 01:00:59.905
this where you actually have to
do an integral and you cannot

01:00:59.905 --> 01:01:02.480
just read off the answer by
looking at it.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:10.579
Then we're done with this whole
momentum thing.

01:01:10.579 --> 01:01:15.202
I will write the postulates
later, so I don't want to write

01:01:15.202 --> 01:01:18.630
it in my handwriting,
but one final time.

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.853
Measurement of x
collapses the function

01:01:20.853 --> 01:01:22.880
ψ(x) to a spike at
x.

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:25.130
Measurement of p
collapses ψ

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:28.742
to that particular plane wave
with that particular p or

01:01:28.742 --> 01:01:30.460
m on the exponent.
 

01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.639
And after that that's what's
taken to be.

01:01:32.639 --> 01:01:35.257
People always ask,
"How do we know what state

01:01:35.257 --> 01:01:37.018
the quantum system is in?"
 

01:01:37.018 --> 01:01:38.940
Who tells you what
ψ(x) is?

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.820
It's the act of measurement.
 

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:44.588
If you measure the guy and you
found him at x = 5 the

01:01:44.588 --> 01:01:47.079
answer is ψ
is a big spike there.

01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:49.865
If you measure momentum and
you've got m = 3 the

01:01:49.865 --> 01:01:53.219
answer is that particular wave
function with 3 on the exponent.

01:01:53.219 --> 01:01:58.920
So measurements are a way to
prepare states.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:03.000
By the way, it's very important
that if you had a system like

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.739
this the probability for getting
a certain x,

01:02:06.739 --> 01:02:10.038
say at this x,
is proportional to the square

01:02:10.038 --> 01:02:11.159
of that number.
 

01:02:11.159 --> 01:02:14.869
Once you took the state and
didn't measure x,

01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:18.139
but measured momentum it'll
become one of these oscillatory

01:02:18.139 --> 01:02:20.340
functions with a definite
wavelength.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.284
It's a complex exponential,
but I'm showing you the real

01:02:23.284 --> 01:02:23.659
part.
 

01:02:23.659 --> 01:02:27.208
Now if you measure position,
in fact the square of this will

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:27.809
be flat.
 

01:02:27.809 --> 01:02:30.880
Remember e^(ipx) is flat.
 

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.967
So in classical mechanics if I
measure position,

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:37.317
and I measure momentum,
and I measure position again

01:02:37.317 --> 01:02:39.880
I'll keep getting the same
answers.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.380
I see where it is.
 

01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.039
I see how fast it's moving.
 

01:02:43.039 --> 01:02:44.360
Again, I see where it is.
 

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.981
If I do all of this in rapid
succession you will get the same

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:49.489
answer xp xp xp.
 

01:02:49.489 --> 01:02:52.628
In quantum theory once you
measure x it'll become a

01:02:52.628 --> 01:02:54.059
big spike at that point.
 

01:02:54.059 --> 01:02:56.639
You can get all kinds of
answers p.

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:59.199
If you measure p you've
got an answer.

01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:01.416
That answer is a new wave
function which is completely

01:03:01.416 --> 01:03:01.710
flat.
 

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.728
That means if you measure
x you'll no longer get

01:03:03.728 --> 01:03:04.440
the old x.
 

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.030
In fact you can get any
x.

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.969
That's why you can never filter
out a state with well defined

01:03:09.969 --> 01:03:12.713
x and p because
states of well defined x

01:03:12.713 --> 01:03:15.300
are very spiky,
and states of well-defined

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:18.630
p are very broad,
so you cannot have it both ways.

01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:22.518
And that's what I want to show
you in this final example.

01:03:22.518 --> 01:03:26.349
I'm going to take the following
wave function on this ring.

01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:31.601
The function I'm going to take
is, ψ is some

01:03:31.601 --> 01:03:35.952
ne^(−α|x|),
mod x [

01:03:35.952 --> 01:03:37.849
|x| ]means this is
x = 0.

01:03:37.849 --> 01:03:42.132
To the right it falls
exponentially and to the left it

01:03:42.132 --> 01:03:43.909
falls exponentially.
 

01:03:43.909 --> 01:03:45.380
Is it clear what I'm saying
here?

01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.170
This is my ring and I'm trying
to plot the function.

01:03:48.170 --> 01:03:52.280
It is highest at the origin and
falls exponentially equally for

01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:54.469
positive and negative x.
 

01:03:54.469 --> 01:03:58.840
So that's the meaning of mod
x.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:02.800
So how far can you go before
ψ becomes negligible?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:06.659
Well, that's when e^(-x)
is a big number.

01:04:06.659 --> 01:04:10.186
So I'm going to assume that
when you go all the way around

01:04:10.186 --> 01:04:12.661
half the circle,
I'm going to assume that

01:04:12.661 --> 01:04:15.260
αL is much bigger
than 1.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:18.545
That means its function dies
very quickly spreading

01:04:18.545 --> 01:04:20.780
negligible beyond some distance.
 

01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:24.179
How far does a function live?
 

01:04:24.179 --> 01:04:28.552
Roughly speaking you can go a
distance Δx so that

01:04:28.552 --> 01:04:31.780
α times Δx is
roughly 1.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.829
Because if you plot this
exponential you ask,

01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:38.614
when does it come to say half
its value or one fourth of its

01:04:38.614 --> 01:04:41.409
value,
you'll find it's some number of

01:04:41.409 --> 01:04:42.710
order 1/α.
 

01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:50.157
So this is a particle whose
position has an uncertainty of

01:04:50.157 --> 01:04:52.510
order 1/α.
 

01:04:52.510 --> 01:04:55.414
So you can make it very narrow
in space so you know pretty much

01:04:55.414 --> 01:04:57.289
where it is or you can make it
broad,

01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:58.909
but I want to consider only
those problems,

01:04:58.909 --> 01:05:03.018
where even if it's broad it's
dead by the time you go to the

01:05:03.018 --> 01:05:04.760
other side to the back.
 

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:08.159
That's for mathematical
convenience.

01:05:08.159 --> 01:05:12.231
So this is the state and I want
to ask myself any question we

01:05:12.231 --> 01:05:12.909
can ask.
 

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:16.059
First question I can ask is if
I look for its position what

01:05:16.059 --> 01:05:16.820
will I find?
 

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.280
I think we have done it many,
many times.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:26.619
You square the guy you get
n^(2)e^(-2α|x|).

01:05:26.619 --> 01:05:27.530
So that's the shape.
 

01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:28.789
That shape looks the same.
 

01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:31.739
If you square an exponential
you get another exponential.

01:05:31.739 --> 01:05:38.947
But now let me demand that this
integral dx be equal to

01:05:38.947 --> 01:05:39.420
1.
 

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:41.230
So what is that integral?
 

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:44.369
I hope you can see that this
function is an even function of

01:05:44.369 --> 01:05:46.340
x because it's mod
x.

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:52.449
So it's double the answer I get
for positive x.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:55.070
Oh yeah, sorry,
not minus infinity.

01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:59.518
It's −L/2 to
L/2.

01:05:59.518 --> 01:06:03.063
You can go this way L/2
and we can go that way

01:06:03.063 --> 01:06:03.949
L/2.
 

01:06:03.949 --> 01:06:09.800
So it's n^(2) is 2 times
e to the -α

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.699
x 2α
x dx.

01:06:13.699 --> 01:06:15.170
Student:  Should it be L
over 2?

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:16.050
Prof: Pardon me?
 

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:17.829
Student:  Should it be L
over 2.

01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:20.619
Prof: Yes, thank you.
 

01:06:20.619 --> 01:06:24.918
So I'm going to now assume that
in the upper limit of the

01:06:24.918 --> 01:06:29.909
integration instead of going up
to L/2 I go to infinity.

01:06:29.909 --> 01:06:33.809
It doesn't matter because this
guy is dead long before that.

01:06:33.809 --> 01:06:35.099
That's why I made that choice.
 

01:06:35.099 --> 01:06:40.463
So that I'm going to write this
2 times N^(2) times 0 to

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.579
infinity e^(-2αx)
dx.

01:06:43.579 --> 01:06:45.289
That's a pretty trivial
integral.

01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:47.889
It's just 1/2α.
 

01:06:47.889 --> 01:06:49.559
If you want I will write it out.
 

01:06:49.559 --> 01:06:54.918
It's
e^(-2αx)/-2α

01:06:54.918 --> 01:06:59.239
from 0 to infinity.
 

01:06:59.239 --> 01:07:01.659
At the upper limit when you put
infinity you get 0.

01:07:01.659 --> 01:07:04.500
At the lower limit when you put
x = 0 you get 1.

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:09.867
There's a minus sign from this
and you get

01:07:09.867 --> 01:07:12.880
N^(2)/α.
 

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:18.637
It should be 1,
or N is equal to the

01:07:18.637 --> 01:07:20.969
√α.
 

01:07:20.969 --> 01:07:23.835
So my normalized wave function,
this is the first order of

01:07:23.835 --> 01:07:30.125
business,
is square root of α

01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:36.420
e^(−α|x )^(|).
 

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:38.050
I just squared it and I
integrated it.

01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:41.130
The only funny business I did
was instead of cutting off the

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:44.264
upper integral at L/2 I
cut if off at infinity because

01:07:44.264 --> 01:07:46.876
e^(−L/2) is
e to the minus nine

01:07:46.876 --> 01:07:48.309
million,
let's say.

01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:51.469
So I don't care if it's nine
million or infinity.

01:07:51.469 --> 01:07:55.489
To make the life simpler I just
did it that way.

01:07:55.489 --> 01:08:02.730
Now I want to ask you,
what is A(p)?

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:07.981
A(p),
the coefficient of the

01:08:07.981 --> 01:08:15.858
expansion remember is
e^(−ipx/â„ )/√L

01:08:15.858 --> 01:08:24.043
times ψ(x) dx
from −L/2 to

01:08:24.043 --> 01:08:26.670
L/2.
 

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:30.119
Now I'm going to work with p
rather than m.

01:08:30.119 --> 01:08:31.210
I will go back and forth.
 

01:08:31.210 --> 01:08:34.233
You should use to the notion
that the momentum can be either

01:08:34.233 --> 01:08:37.256
labeled by the actual momentum
or the quantum number m which

01:08:37.256 --> 01:08:39.869
tells you how much momentum you
have in multiples of

01:08:39.869 --> 01:08:41.100
2Πâ„ /m.
 

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:42.710
So you've got to do this
integral.

01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:44.649
So let's write this integral.
 

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:51.868
This looks like
−L/2 to L/2.

01:08:51.868 --> 01:08:59.867
In fact I'm going to change
this integral to minus infinity

01:08:59.867 --> 01:09:07.037
to plus infinity because this
function e^(ipx/ℏ)

01:09:07.037 --> 01:09:13.380
times
e^(−α|x|) dx.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.604
Do you understand that these
limits can be made to be plus

01:09:16.604 --> 01:09:20.113
and minus infinity because area
under a graph that's falling so

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:22.225
rapidly,
whether it's between minus and

01:09:22.225 --> 01:09:24.289
plus L/2 or minus and
plus infinity,

01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:25.510
is going to be the same.
 

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:29.890
It's just that this integral is
so much easier to do.

01:09:29.890 --> 01:09:34.698
Now you cannot jump out and do
this integral because it's a mod

01:09:34.698 --> 01:09:35.939
x here.
 

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:38.610
So mod x is not
x, it is x when

01:09:38.610 --> 01:09:41.439
it's positive and it's -x
when it's negative.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:44.198
So you've got to break this
integral into two parts.

01:09:44.198 --> 01:09:49.150
One part where x is
positive from 0 to infinity,

01:09:49.150 --> 01:09:52.726
I'm sorry, I also forgot a
root, α

01:09:52.726 --> 01:09:55.020
and A√L.
 

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.560
Do you see that?
 

01:09:56.560 --> 01:10:04.060
So this is really square root
of α/L times

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:12.118
e^(-αx)
e^(−ipx/â„ ) dx

01:10:12.118 --> 01:10:19.899
plus another integral from
minus infinity to 0 e^(

01:10:19.899 --> 01:10:27.538
αx) times
e^(−ipx/â„ ) dx.

01:10:27.538 --> 01:10:30.050
I split the integral into two
parts.

01:10:30.050 --> 01:10:31.760
So I didn't make a mistake here.
 

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:35.805
This really is e^( αx)
because x is

01:10:35.805 --> 01:10:36.630
negative.
 

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:38.710
So what one does in such
situations,

01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:40.738
I'm going to do it quickly and
you can go home and check it,

01:10:40.738 --> 01:10:43.228
just calculus,
change the variable from

01:10:43.228 --> 01:10:45.520
x to -x
everywhere.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:49.100
In the terms of new variable
this will make a -x.

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.310
That'll become x.
 

01:10:51.310 --> 01:10:54.180
dx will become minus of
the new variable.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.739
The limits will be plus
infinity to 0,

01:10:56.739 --> 01:11:00.340
and you can flip that for
another change of sign 0 to

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.238
infinity.
 

01:11:01.238 --> 01:11:03.368
So that was a very rapid
slight-of-hand,

01:11:03.368 --> 01:11:05.170
but I don't want to delay that.
 

01:11:05.170 --> 01:11:08.904
This is just--you go home and
if you want check that if

01:11:08.904 --> 01:11:11.810
x goes to -x you
get that.

01:11:11.810 --> 01:11:17.198
So you notice this is the
complex conjugate of this one.

01:11:17.198 --> 01:11:19.979
Whatever function I'm
integrating here is the

01:11:19.979 --> 01:11:23.327
conjugate of it because this is
real, αx,

01:11:23.327 --> 01:11:25.979
and -ipx has become
ipx.

01:11:25.979 --> 01:11:29.363
So if I find the first part of
the integral I just take that

01:11:29.363 --> 01:11:31.369
times its conjugate and I'm
done.

01:11:31.369 --> 01:11:33.220
So what do I get for that?
 

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:37.880
I get square root of
α/L times--

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:43.244
remember integral
e^(-αx)

01:11:43.244 --> 01:11:48.038
dx from 0 to infinity is
1/α,

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:55.769
but what I have here is dx
e^(-α) ip/â„ 

01:11:55.769 --> 01:12:05.270
x_0 to infinity
plus the complex conjugate.

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:08.582
Now you may be very nervous
about doing this integral with a

01:12:08.582 --> 01:12:11.949
complex number in it because
real we all know the integral is

01:12:11.949 --> 01:12:14.140
just 1/α
e^(-α).

01:12:14.140 --> 01:12:17.220
It turns out that it's true
even if it's got an imaginary

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:19.859
part as long as you have a
positive real part.

01:12:19.859 --> 01:12:22.161
In other words,
the answer here doesn't depend

01:12:22.161 --> 01:12:23.439
on this guy being real.
 

01:12:23.439 --> 01:12:29.141
So it's really α
over L times 1 over

01:12:29.141 --> 01:12:35.557
α ip/â„  plus a
complex conjugate which is

01:12:35.557 --> 01:12:40.430
α −
ip/â„ .

01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:45.595
Now you should be able to
combine these two denominators

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:51.045
and you get square root of
α/L divided by α^(2)

01:12:51.045 --> 01:12:56.399
plus p^(2) over
â„ ^(2) times 2α.

01:12:56.399 --> 01:12:58.653
Again, this is something you
can go and check,

01:12:58.653 --> 01:13:01.456
but I don't want to wait until
everyone can do this thing

01:13:01.456 --> 01:13:03.760
because I want to tell you the
punch line.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.729
So this is what it looks like.
 

01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:09.086
A(p) looks like a whole
bunch of numbers I'm not going

01:13:09.086 --> 01:13:11.658
to worry about,
but look at the denominator.

01:13:11.658 --> 01:13:15.443
It's α^(2) p^(2)
over â„ ^(2),

01:13:15.443 --> 01:13:18.840
or if you want multiply by
ℏ^(2).

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:23.600
There are some other numbers
I'm not interested in.

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.979
The numbers are not important.
 

01:13:24.979 --> 01:13:29.743
How does it vary with p
is all I'm asking you to think

01:13:29.743 --> 01:13:30.380
about.
 

01:13:30.380 --> 01:13:34.836
I'm sorry, A(p), this is
just A(p),

01:13:34.836 --> 01:13:39.756
but I want the A(p)
squared that looks like the

01:13:39.756 --> 01:13:41.520
square of this.
 

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:46.818
All I want you to notice is
that this function is peaked at

01:13:46.818 --> 01:13:52.300
p = 0 and falls very
rapidly as p increases.

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.788
When p is 0 you've got
the biggest height.

01:13:54.788 --> 01:13:57.479
When does it become half as big
or one fourth as big?

01:13:57.479 --> 01:14:01.172
Roughly when p^(2) is
equal to h^(2)α^(2)

01:14:01.172 --> 01:14:04.560
because that's when these
numbers become comparable,

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:09.322
therefore when p is
â„ α this function

01:14:09.322 --> 01:14:14.586
will have a denominator which is
twice what it had here or maybe

01:14:14.586 --> 01:14:15.840
one fourth.
 

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.118
I'm not worried about factors
like 1 and 2.

01:14:18.118 --> 01:14:22.628
The point is in momentum space,
in momentum you can get all

01:14:22.628 --> 01:14:26.840
kinds of values of p,
but the odds decrease very

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.439
rapidly for p bigger than
â„ α.

01:14:30.439 --> 01:14:33.300
So the most likely value is 0,
but that's the spread.

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:36.618
And Δp is
â„ α,

01:14:36.618 --> 01:14:39.908
or α times
Δp is â„ ,

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:45.735
and that is the uncertainty
principle because α

01:14:45.735 --> 01:14:48.649
is just Δx.
 

01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:50.192
By the way, I will publish
these notes too,

01:14:50.192 --> 01:14:52.248
so you don't have to worry if
you didn't write everything

01:14:52.248 --> 01:14:52.579
down.
 

01:14:52.579 --> 01:14:53.760
I suggest you--yes?
 

01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:56.850
Student:  Can you go
over again what cc is?

01:14:56.850 --> 01:14:58.319
Prof: Complex conjugate.
 

01:14:58.319 --> 01:14:59.840
That's what I did.
 

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.158
Whatever number this one is the
other guy is obtained by

01:15:03.158 --> 01:15:05.149
changing i to -i.
 

01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:07.380
Look, all I want you to notice
is this.

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:12.850
I took a function whose width
is roughly 1/α.

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:15.560
Then I looked at what kind of
momenta I can get.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.780
Then I find that the narrower
the function bigger the spread

01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:22.500
in the possible momenta you can
get.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:25.640
So squeezing it in x
broadens it out in p.

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.899
And that's the origin of the
uncertainty principle.

01:15:27.899 --> 01:15:29.350
It's simply a mathematical
result.

01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:32.391
The functions which are narrow
in x have a Fourier

01:15:32.391 --> 01:15:34.618
series which is very broad in
p.

01:15:34.618 --> 01:15:37.636
The quantum mechanics relates
p to momentum and

01:15:37.636 --> 01:15:39.800
therefore the uncertainty
principle.

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.041
So anyway, I'll give you some
homework on this,

01:15:42.041 --> 01:15:44.671
and you can also fill in the
blanks of this derivation,

01:15:44.671 --> 01:15:46.279
which I think is very useful.
 

01:15:46.279 --> 01:15:51.000

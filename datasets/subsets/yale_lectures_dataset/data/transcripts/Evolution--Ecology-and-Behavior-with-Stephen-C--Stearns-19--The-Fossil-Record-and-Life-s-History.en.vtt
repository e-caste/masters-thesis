00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.728
Prof: Then today we're
going to take our third look at

00:00:06.728 --> 00:00:09.730
the history of life on this
planet,

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.966
and it's going to be about the
fossil record and the major

00:00:13.966 --> 00:00:15.230
groups of life.
 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.326
You remember,
the first look was major

00:00:17.326 --> 00:00:19.990
transitions, and the issues
involved in them.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.723
The second look was how life
shaped the planet and how the

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.453
planet shaped life;
so it was a description of the

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:28.440
geological theater in which
evolution has occurred.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.540
And today we'll actually look
at the fossil record,

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.640
which has its own unique and
important messages.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.730
So I'm going to again give you
another view of geological time.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.077
This is something that's
important to build up in your

00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:43.520
head.
 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.540
It takes awhile.
 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.545
The names are unfamiliar,
the depth of time is

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:48.480
astonishing.
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.047
But it's a very necessary
framework for understanding

00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:53.900
evolution on this planet.
 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.850
We'll talk about a few big
events, the major radiations,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.580
the groups that are still
expanding,

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.270
the ones that are vanishing or
gone,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.732
vanishing communities,
extraordinary extinct

00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:04.700
creatures.
 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.700
Then I'll mention stasis and
I'll also mention Cope's law.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.760
So here is another way of
looking at geological time.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.340
Last time I showed you the
24-hour clock.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.748
This time I'm showing you a
series of blowups,

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:22.489
a three-panel blowup.
 

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:25.400
So here is the origin of the
planet.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.700
Here is today, up here.
 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.780
And the pre-Cambrian is in red.
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.836
So this is everything before
the major animal groups and

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:37.269
fossils with hard parts appear.
 

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:39.760
And, as you can see,
that's most of life.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.180
Roughly speaking,
life begins here,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.790
and becomes eukaryotic
somewhere around here,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330
and multi-cellular somewhere
around here,

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.882
and we start picking fossils up
at the beginning of the

00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:54.660
Cambrian,
in any kind of numbers;

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.540
there were a few before then.
 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.415
And then if we take everything
after the Cambrian--it's called

00:02:00.415 --> 00:02:03.594
the Phanerozoic;
that's this column here--and we

00:02:03.594 --> 00:02:06.055
blow that up,
and you can see it falls into

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:10.098
the Paleozoic,
the Mesozoic and the Cenozoic,

00:02:10.098 --> 00:02:13.330
with all of these eras in it.
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.718
And some of these eras are
actually marked,

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:18.250
their endings are marked by
mass extinctions,

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.770
and the way that the geologists
could tell,

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.568
around the world,
looking at different rocks that

00:02:23.568 --> 00:02:25.960
they were dealing with the same
rocks,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.503
is that there are
characteristic fossils found in

00:02:29.503 --> 00:02:34.008
them that disappeared all over
the world at a certain time.

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:36.205
And so, for example,
the disappearance--the

00:02:36.205 --> 00:02:39.027
trilobites appear in the
Cambrian and they disappear at

00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:40.440
the end of the Permian.
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.849
Any rock in the world that you
see that has a trilobite in it

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.348
is going to be in the Paleozoic.
 

00:02:47.348 --> 00:02:49.393
The ammonites,
you'll see in a few minutes,

00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:52.068
appear and disappear a number
of times, but they finally

00:02:52.068 --> 00:02:54.160
disappear at the end of the
Cretaceous.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.782
Any rock in it that's got a
complex ammonite in it is

00:02:58.782 --> 00:02:59.758
Mesozoic.
 

00:02:59.758 --> 00:03:03.419
So these geological eras are
actually,

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.364
in part, defined by fossils,
and the coordination of them

00:03:07.364 --> 00:03:11.378
across the planet is done by
matching types of fossils.

00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:14.366
In the late twentieth century
we had radiometric dating that

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:17.302
helped a great deal with this,
and that's gotten better and

00:03:17.302 --> 00:03:17.860
better.
 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.258
But the original layout was
done with fossils.

00:03:22.258 --> 00:03:25.394
And if we then take everything
that's happened since the

00:03:25.394 --> 00:03:28.870
end-Cretaceous mass extinction,
that's called the Cenozoic.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.830
So this, the Mesozoic is more
or less the Age of Reptiles;

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.120
the Cenozoic is the Age of
Mammals;

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.280
and we blow the Cenozoic up,
this is what we get.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.555
We get Paleocene,
Eocene, Oligocene,

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:41.699
Miocene, Pliocene,
Pleistocene.

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.360
And the last 10,000 years is
the Holocene;

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.113
that's since the glaciers
melted, that's the period we

00:03:49.113 --> 00:03:50.530
call the Holocene.
 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.158
And roughly speaking the world
restocks itself with

00:03:55.158 --> 00:03:59.139
biodiversity in the Paleocene
and Eocene.

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.314
We have roughly modern levels
of biodiversity since the

00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:08.110
Oligocene, in terms of mammal
families and things like that.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.048
And most of the mammal orders
have their roots in the Eocene

00:04:15.048 --> 00:04:19.149
and Paleocene;
as you'll see in a bit.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:23.339
Now if we look at large-scale
events, one of the most

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:28.014
interesting is well when did
multi-cellular life really get

00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:28.819
going?
 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:35.798
And for that the tiny fossils
that are preserved in phosphate

00:04:35.798 --> 00:04:40.800
beds in China are absolutely
astonishing.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.908
These things have been
discovered within the last ten

00:04:44.908 --> 00:04:45.540
years.
 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.740
They come from a number of
places in China,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.240
but this spot,
Chengjiang, in Yunnan Province,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.774
is--I think it's on Yunnan;
it might be just on the border

00:04:59.774 --> 00:05:03.987
with another province there;
no province lines in the

00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:08.709
map--are certainly some of the
earliest and most intriguing.

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:12.139
So the Cambrian starts at about
550.

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.730
So this is 20 million years
before the Cambrian;

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.740
we're in the Vendian,
we're in the late-Proterozic

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.110
Era.
 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.817
And a lake, or an inlet,
dried up and the salts in it

00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:31.730
crystallized and they perfectly
preserved the algae that were in

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.500
it.
 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.442
So these are micrographs of
microfossils showing

00:05:36.442 --> 00:05:40.470
multi-cellular algae,
and in some of them you can

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.750
even see the spindles in the
mitotic divisions.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.610
In formations in China of the
same age, there are

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.220
multi-cellular,
bilateral animals.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:03.079
These look like early-stage
cell divisions of Crustacea.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:07.610
So this is again 20 million
years before the Cambrian,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.697
and the implication that there
might be a Crustacean 20 million

00:06:12.697 --> 00:06:17.209
years before the Cambrian is a
very interesting one,

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:19.439
as you'll see in a minute.
 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:24.879
So our molecular phylogenies
suggest,

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.528
looking not at the fossils but
at the molecules,

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:31.579
that the eukaryotic
radiation--so that's before

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:35.028
multi-cellularity;
this is just the eukaryotic

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:38.841
cells making Protista--that was
underway about a billion years

00:06:38.841 --> 00:06:39.279
ago.
 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.889
These microfossils support the
idea that many groups may have

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.500
diverged before the Cambrian,
but we have no trace of them in

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.730
the fossils.
 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.245
We just have this marker;
we have these Crustacean-like

00:06:54.245 --> 00:06:55.350
embryos.
 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:02.230
Now if that's really true,
then the first fossils of large

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.446
animals,
animals that you could see with

00:07:05.446 --> 00:07:08.218
the naked eye,
that had hard body parts,

00:07:08.218 --> 00:07:11.170
that had endoskeletons or
exoskeletons,

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.310
these things crop up in the
Cambrian,

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.211
and they may simply then be
recording the fact that formerly

00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:20.519
soft-bodied things started to
acquire skeletons.

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:24.064
So the groups existed before
then, they just couldn't be

00:07:24.064 --> 00:07:27.867
fossilized, and that that may
very well have been because of

00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:29.930
co-evolution with predators.
 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.220
So that's the picture that
seems to be emerging.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.795
I just want to remind you that
the Tree of Life has these three

00:07:37.795 --> 00:07:41.264
big groups in it,
and we're now going to blow up

00:07:41.264 --> 00:07:42.740
this part of it.
 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.839
Here we are.
 

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:48.345
The Chinese microfossils look
like they're right about here,

00:07:48.345 --> 00:07:51.399
and they are at 570 million
years ago.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:54.589
And if we just walk out around
the Tree of Life,

00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:56.971
and say, "Oh,
anything that has that branch

00:07:56.971 --> 00:07:59.149
length from what we think is the
origin,

00:07:59.149 --> 00:08:00.560
was probably there at the same
time,

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.470
even though we don't have a
fossil of it."

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.750
That's the implication of the
molecular phylogeny;

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.451
it's that everything else
that's about that far out from

00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:12.019
the common ancestor was probably
there at the time.

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:14.550
That means that all these other
branches were there too.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.925
Now most of these other things
are single-celled organisms,

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:20.660
and we wouldn't expect them to
leave fossils.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.170
Okay?
 

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.785
I mean, we've got stuff like
slime molds and amoebas and

00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:30.562
euglenas, the ancestors
of--let's see,

00:08:30.562 --> 00:08:34.850
where is malaria and stuff like
that?

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:37.120
We've got all kinds of algae
out here.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.908
Those things were probably all
there.

00:08:38.908 --> 00:08:40.460
We just don't have fossils of
them.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.947
And that's why it's really
important to be able to deal

00:08:43.947 --> 00:08:47.500
with both the molecular
phylogenies and the fossils,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:52.139
because they complement each
other and they allow a kind of

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:56.220
inference that's not available
from either alone.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.460
Now, what happens in the
Cambrian?

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.254
That's when we really start-
when the fossil record really

00:09:04.254 --> 00:09:05.120
gets going.
 

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.760
The idea that there was an
explosion of biodiversity in the

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.090
Cambrian seems to be well
supported by the fossils.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.398
Okay?
 

00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:15.417
This is the number of orders
that can be observed,

00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:16.649
of animal groups.
 

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:20.547
So these are fairly large
clades of marine invertebrates

00:09:20.547 --> 00:09:22.863
that start--
and some, by the way,

00:09:22.863 --> 00:09:26.398
by the end of the Cambrian,
we start picking up vertebrates

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:30.938
as well--
and they start getting added on

00:09:30.938 --> 00:09:33.899
at a pretty high rate.
 

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:37.590
And the interesting thing is no
major body plans appear in the

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.009
fossil record,
in animals, after that.

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:42.970
They do in the plants,
but in the animals it's as

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.500
though there's one burst of
diversity,

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.808
550 million years ago,
and then all the major body

00:09:48.808 --> 00:09:52.485
plans get frozen,
and we don't get new kinds of

00:09:52.485 --> 00:09:54.090
animals after that.
 

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:59.830
That's kind of a puzzling and
not completely solved problem.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.240
Why was it that way?
 

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.600
Now let's take a look at one of
these communities.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.429
They contain some organisms
that are profoundly weird.

00:10:15.928 --> 00:10:18.519
By the way, they weren't very
big.

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:23.219
The giant among them,
the sperm whale of the Cambrian

00:10:23.219 --> 00:10:25.840
seas was this guy,
up here.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.394
Okay?
 

00:10:26.394 --> 00:10:31.277
That's Anomalocaris,
and that is an arthropod

00:10:31.277 --> 00:10:34.499
predator,
arthropod-like predator,

00:10:34.499 --> 00:10:38.798
and it's got some funny sort of
quasi-tentacle antennae,

00:10:38.798 --> 00:10:41.149
and a mouth right here,
and it swims around,

00:10:41.149 --> 00:10:44.179
and it's the biggest,
nastiest thing in the ocean,

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:45.980
and it's about this big.
 

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.019
So if you are skin-diving in a
Cambrian sea,

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:52.200
you don't need to worry about
white sharks.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.700
You are actually the biggest,
meanest thing around.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.080
Okay?
 

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.120
And that's an interesting
observation.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.793
Again and again,
in fossil history,

00:11:01.793 --> 00:11:04.389
things start small and get big.
 

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:07.697
Things start small and have
short generation times and short

00:11:07.697 --> 00:11:10.948
lives, and get to be big and
have long generation times and

00:11:10.948 --> 00:11:11.788
long lives.
 

00:11:11.788 --> 00:11:14.894
And I don't mean by that that
the small things are replaced by

00:11:14.894 --> 00:11:18.220
the big things;
the big things add onto them.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.734
It's like a community would be
dominated initially by small

00:11:21.734 --> 00:11:25.249
things, and they would continue
to be there, but big things

00:11:25.249 --> 00:11:26.278
would evolve.
 

00:11:26.278 --> 00:11:30.408
So this is that process
starting to happen.

00:11:30.408 --> 00:11:34.947
There are a few things that
were running around,

00:11:34.947 --> 00:11:39.389
in these oceans,
that we don't have anymore.

00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:42.440
There are trilobites here,
of course.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.610
There is this profoundly
puzzling creature.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.000
Okay?
 

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.769
And we're going to--that's
Opabinia--we're going to take a

00:11:49.769 --> 00:11:51.519
good look at it,
in a few minutes.

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:54.009
That's one of the favorite
animals of Derek Briggs,

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:56.350
who's now the director of the
Peabody Museum.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.952
Derek, by the way,
has great BBC cartoons of the

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:02.558
way these things swam and moved.
 

00:12:02.558 --> 00:12:06.558
He's done the functional
morphology of the Cambrian

00:12:06.558 --> 00:12:07.519
community.
 

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:12.731
So if you're interested in
that, maybe you could talk Derek

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.889
into having a showing.
 

00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:17.240
So that is something that's not
around anymore.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.710
But something like this is.
 

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:22.270
That's a priapulid worm,
and there are still priapulid

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.960
worms that look pretty much like
that.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.820
So that thing is now a living
fossil.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.787
And here's an Onychophoran,
and Onychophorans that look

00:12:30.787 --> 00:12:33.370
just like that are running
around the Australian

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.866
rainforests now;
instead of living on reefs,

00:12:35.866 --> 00:12:38.868
they're running around the
rainforest, but they look pretty

00:12:38.868 --> 00:12:39.799
much like that.
 

00:12:39.799 --> 00:12:42.110
Okay?
 

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:49.807
So the things that we get in
the Cambrian are at least three

00:12:49.807 --> 00:12:53.070
of the mollusk classes.
 

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.293
So these are the chitons,
these are the snails,

00:12:56.293 --> 00:12:59.940
and these are the squids,
octopuses and ammonites.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.730
We get the polychaetes,
which are the biggest group of

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.625
the annelids--the ones that are
most familiar to you are

00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:08.649
probably earthworms;
those are oligochaetes.

00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:11.076
But the polychaetes--I think
there are 43 families of

00:13:11.076 --> 00:13:11.730
polychaetes.
 

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:15.078
They're a very dominant group
in the ocean,

00:13:15.078 --> 00:13:18.110
and have been for 550 million
years.

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:20.759
We start getting arthropods;
so we get the trilobites.

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:23.998
The chelicerates are the
horseshoe crabs and the spiders

00:13:23.998 --> 00:13:26.825
and their relatives,
and we start picking up some

00:13:26.825 --> 00:13:27.649
Crustacea.
 

00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:30.273
We get the brachiopods,
the lampshells,

00:13:30.273 --> 00:13:32.000
which are still around.
 

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.546
If you go diving on a reef in
Malaysia, you can see

00:13:36.546 --> 00:13:37.820
brachiopods.
 

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.110
There are deep-water
brachiopods around the world,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:44.668
but they've mostly been in
retreat for a long time.

00:13:44.668 --> 00:13:47.799
And we get echinoderms,
and the fact that we get

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:51.663
echinoderms is interesting
because they're the sister group

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:54.668
of the chordates,
and that implies that the

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:57.500
chordates had diverged from the
echinoderms,

00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.684
at that point,
and they just weren't

00:13:59.684 --> 00:14:00.558
fossilizing.
 

00:14:00.558 --> 00:14:02.982
And we know,
from the first fossils that we

00:14:02.982 --> 00:14:05.058
can get of things like
Amphioxus,

00:14:05.058 --> 00:14:08.889
that if you have a tiny,
little, one-inch long,

00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:12.171
translucent,
tadpole-like,

00:14:12.171 --> 00:14:16.210
fish-like chordate,
that's the ancestor of the

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.389
vertebrates,
it's probably not going to

00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:19.048
fossilize.
 

00:14:19.048 --> 00:14:21.706
So our best evidence that that
divergence had occurred is the

00:14:21.706 --> 00:14:23.080
existence of the echinoderms.
 

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.197
And by the way,
the echinoderms went through an

00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:26.210
explosive radiation.
 

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.028
They made many classes.
 

00:14:28.028 --> 00:14:30.431
The different classes of the
echinoderms now are things like

00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:32.058
the asteroids,
which are the starfish;

00:14:32.058 --> 00:14:35.606
the holothuroids,
which are the sea cucumbers,

00:14:35.606 --> 00:14:36.788
and so forth.
 

00:14:36.788 --> 00:14:39.514
There are, I think,
six or seven classes currently

00:14:39.514 --> 00:14:42.297
of echinoderms;
but back in the Cambrian there

00:14:42.297 --> 00:14:44.379
were about twenty-five or
thirty.

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:46.168
Most of them have now gone
extinct.

00:14:46.168 --> 00:14:50.197
And some of those things that
you saw in that earlier picture

00:14:50.197 --> 00:14:52.750
were extinct classes of
echinoderms.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:56.664
Okay, so for the animals
there's this explosion 550 to

00:14:56.664 --> 00:14:59.620
500 million years ago in the
Cambrian.

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:01.379
It's very different for the
plants.

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:06.533
The plants had a much steadier,
more measured evolution of

00:15:06.533 --> 00:15:07.620
diversity.
 

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.990
Okay?
 

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.056
The major groups of plants
arrive later because plants got

00:15:13.056 --> 00:15:14.340
onto land later.
 

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.650
Most of the animal groups,
all the animal groups

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.158
originated in the ocean,
but much of plant diversity

00:15:19.158 --> 00:15:22.350
originated on land;
so they had to get onto land.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.143
The mosses and the ferns appear
in the fossil record in the

00:15:27.143 --> 00:15:30.450
Devonian, about 400 million
years ago.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.631
The gymnosperms,
which is pines and firs and

00:15:33.631 --> 00:15:36.075
their relatives,
they actually are

00:15:36.075 --> 00:15:38.000
350-million-years-old.
 

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.320
So they appear in the early
Carboniferous,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.830
and they undergo continuing
evolution up to the present day.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:47.019
So they keep getting-
diversifying and becoming more

00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:48.019
sophisticated.
 

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:52.167
But there are recognizable
gymnosperms 350 million years

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:52.620
ago.
 

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:56.928
And when the flowering plants
evolve depends on whether you're

00:15:56.928 --> 00:15:59.330
looking at molecules or fossils.
 

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.825
The molecules suggest that it
might be as old as

00:16:02.825 --> 00:16:06.971
Carboniferous-Permian-Triassic;
that is, 200 to 300 million

00:16:06.971 --> 00:16:07.659
years ago.
 

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:11.110
Some people don't believe that.
 

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.961
The really solid evidence,
of course, is the fossil,

00:16:13.961 --> 00:16:15.860
at a certain age,
and that's in the

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.980
late-Cretaceous.
 

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:23.091
So you can see angiosperms that
are 75-million-years-old in the

00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:24.668
fossil record.
 

00:16:24.668 --> 00:16:27.871
This is what the first plant on
land might have looked like,

00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:30.750
and the first plant on land
might actually have been a

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:31.509
liverwort.
 

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:34.870
So this is a thalloid liverwort.
 

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.961
And when you look at it,
it looks a fair amount like

00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:43.215
algae that we are familiar with
and that we see in the

00:16:43.215 --> 00:16:44.820
intertidal zone.
 

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.842
It doesn't really look that
different in its structure from

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:53.740
a marine alga,
but it is adapted for living on

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:54.519
land.
 

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:57.548
And to get onto land this is
what you need.

00:16:57.548 --> 00:17:00.327
If you're an animal,
you're going to have to come up

00:17:00.327 --> 00:17:01.798
with an impermeable skin.
 

00:17:01.798 --> 00:17:04.828
If you want to locomote on
land, you'll need limbs,

00:17:04.828 --> 00:17:08.038
and for that you'll need
shoulder and hip supports.

00:17:08.038 --> 00:17:10.048
And if you want to reproduce on
land,

00:17:10.048 --> 00:17:11.660
rather than in the water--which
is,

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.994
of course, what many of the
amphibians have continued to

00:17:13.994 --> 00:17:15.565
do--
then you'll need an egg that

00:17:15.565 --> 00:17:16.269
won't dry out.
 

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:18.856
So you need a shell and an
amnion, and this basically is

00:17:18.856 --> 00:17:21.210
something that happened between
the amphibians,

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.960
and then everything that came
later in the tetrapods.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.259
If you're a plant,
you need an impermeable leaf.

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:30.662
That means you need to invent
the biochemistry and the

00:17:30.662 --> 00:17:33.680
developmental biology to make a
waxy cuticle.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.730
You need a means of gas
exchange.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.282
So you're going to have to
invent all of the neat stuff

00:17:39.282 --> 00:17:42.836
about stomata and stomatal
regulation of carbon dioxide

00:17:42.836 --> 00:17:45.140
coming in and oxygen going out.
 

00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:48.470
And you'll need to have roots,
resistant spores;

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.019
eventually you'll need seeds.
 

00:17:51.019 --> 00:17:54.133
So there's really quite a bit
of stuff to evolve,

00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:55.819
when you come onto land.
 

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.150
This is a major event.
 

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.858
It was complicated and it took
some time.

00:17:59.858 --> 00:18:03.718
If we look at the vertebrates
coming onto land,

00:18:03.718 --> 00:18:07.410
here are some late-Devonian
lobe-fin fish.

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:11.334
So the group that seems to have
spawned the tetrapods is related

00:18:11.334 --> 00:18:13.950
to the Coelacanths,
the lobe-fin fishes.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.998
I'll show you a picture of
Eustenopteron and Ichthyostega

00:18:17.998 --> 00:18:19.009
in a moment.
 

00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:24.080
And these things start--this
creature, Eustenopteron,

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.910
is actually a pelagic fish.
 

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:32.450
It's not really crawling around
in the drying up lagoon;

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.380
it appears to be swimming in
open water.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.586
But, as you'll see in a minute,
it has really pretty good

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:41.140
beginnings of the tetrapod limb.
 

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.067
So it looks like some of the
structural elements in the

00:18:45.067 --> 00:18:47.472
skeleton,
that were needed for things to

00:18:47.472 --> 00:18:49.949
come on land,
probably developed for other

00:18:49.949 --> 00:18:52.869
reasons,
in another environment,

00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:56.083
as an exaptation,
something that happened for

00:18:56.083 --> 00:18:57.868
other reasons earlier in
evolution,

00:18:57.868 --> 00:19:02.930
and that could then be co-opted
and used to get onto land.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:04.470
And these are some of the
relatives.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.318
Okay?
 

00:19:05.318 --> 00:19:09.263
So you can see Coelacanths in
the fossil record at 360 million

00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:13.143
years, and you can see them from
a submersible off Madagascar

00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:13.789
today.
 

00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:16.809
They're a nice living fossil.
 

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.480
Here's Eustenopteron.
 

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.700
The skeletons are recovered
from Miguasha in Quebec;

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.910
385-million-years-old.
 

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:33.142
It was a pelagic fish,
and you can see that it already

00:19:33.142 --> 00:19:37.453
is getting, in its hind limbs,
many of the identifiable

00:19:37.453 --> 00:19:40.170
elements of a vertebrate limb.
 

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.849
So this is a blowup of the
pectoral of Eustenopteron.

00:19:44.849 --> 00:19:47.680
It appears to have a humerus.
 

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.328
This is Ichthyostega.
 

00:19:49.328 --> 00:19:54.569
This thing is a transition form
between fish and amphibia.

00:19:54.569 --> 00:19:57.848
It's late-Devonian;
it's 20 million years later.

00:19:57.848 --> 00:20:01.098
These usually come from eastern
Greenland;

00:20:01.098 --> 00:20:03.088
that's where the fossil
deposits are.

00:20:03.088 --> 00:20:06.623
And this guy already has most
of the elements of the

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:07.868
vertebrate limb.
 

00:20:07.868 --> 00:20:11.108
So this developed in a swimming
environment.

00:20:11.108 --> 00:20:14.806
This guy arguably was crawling
around in shallow water,

00:20:14.806 --> 00:20:17.750
but he can't support himself as
an adult.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:22.340
That shoulder girdle and the
hip girdle are not strong enough

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:27.009
for that animal to actually walk
on land, if it's an adult.

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:29.538
The larvae could.
 

00:20:29.538 --> 00:20:34.242
So perhaps the first stage of
coming onto land was the kids

00:20:34.242 --> 00:20:37.891
went exploring,
and then they went back in the

00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:40.730
water and grew up to be adults.
 

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.766
The parents couldn't go into
the new habitat because they

00:20:43.766 --> 00:20:47.019
didn't have limbs that were
strong enough to support them.

00:20:47.019 --> 00:20:49.220
I think that's kind of a cool
idea.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:52.008
So it might have been that,
just like with computers,

00:20:52.008 --> 00:20:54.690
the young were showing the old
which way was up.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.618
If we look at the plant
radiation,

00:21:01.618 --> 00:21:06.080
there's a whole series of
acquisitions of major elements

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.883
of what it means to be a plant,
and they occur at a pretty

00:21:11.883 --> 00:21:18.440
steady pace between about 450
and 75 million years ago.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.818
So chlorophyll B is quite old.
 

00:21:22.818 --> 00:21:28.726
I would guess that chlorophyll
B is on the order of maybe 1 to

00:21:28.726 --> 00:21:31.048
1.5 billion years old.
 

00:21:31.048 --> 00:21:35.613
You get plant cell structure
probably at the level of about a

00:21:35.613 --> 00:21:36.828
billion years.
 

00:21:36.828 --> 00:21:41.102
You get alternation of
generations, haploid/diploid

00:21:41.102 --> 00:21:44.348
generations, coming in pretty
early.

00:21:44.348 --> 00:21:50.180
Then you have,
as you move out of the mosses,

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:55.003
and move towards the club
mosses, you can see that the

00:21:55.003 --> 00:21:59.420
water delivery system,
of plants, starts to develop.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.576
So they're developing roots and
they're developing all of the

00:22:03.576 --> 00:22:07.869
plumbing that will allow water
to move and bring nutrients from

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:10.778
the roots up into a growing
structure.

00:22:10.778 --> 00:22:15.380
Wood starts to develop right
about in here,

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:20.695
and by the time you get up into
the Equisitifolia and the

00:22:20.695 --> 00:22:25.643
precursors to the gymnosperms,
you're getting pretty well

00:22:25.643 --> 00:22:28.855
developed xylem;
so you're getting phloem,

00:22:28.855 --> 00:22:32.098
complex xylem,
and a pretty good delivery

00:22:32.098 --> 00:22:32.910
system.
 

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:38.180
Then the seeds evolved with the
gymnosperms;

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.548
gymnosperm means naked seed.
 

00:22:40.548 --> 00:22:43.828
And this is the radiation here
of the gymnosperms.

00:22:43.828 --> 00:22:50.336
The Pinales would be the pine
trees, and firs,

00:22:50.336 --> 00:22:52.940
and all of that.
 

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:54.968
And the Gingkoes,
of course, are the familiar

00:22:54.968 --> 00:22:57.180
Gingko trees;
there's one down here at the

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.809
corner of the Peabody Museum.
 

00:22:58.809 --> 00:23:00.358
And that makes a clade.
 

00:23:00.358 --> 00:23:02.670
And that's where seeds were
invented.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.917
Then as we go up further,
we get into pollen grains that

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:09.048
have a distal aperture,
and then finally we get to the

00:23:09.048 --> 00:23:10.288
flowering plants.
 

00:23:10.288 --> 00:23:13.130
And at the base of the
angiosperms,

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:18.250
down here, there are some
wonderful and weird plants,

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.480
and the only one that I'd
really like to mention now,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.395
time permitting,
is Welwitschia,

00:23:23.395 --> 00:23:24.880
which is the Gnetales.
 

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.173
And Welwitschia is a plant that
basically is a root with two

00:23:29.173 --> 00:23:33.684
leaves, and the two leaves can
grow to be up to 100 or 200 feet

00:23:33.684 --> 00:23:34.338
long.
 

00:23:34.338 --> 00:23:36.450
It lives in the sand dunes of
Namibia,

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:42.078
and because sand drifts and
makes dunes that grow,

00:23:42.078 --> 00:23:45.035
Welwitschia can keep growing to
keep its leaves on top of the

00:23:45.035 --> 00:23:45.430
dunes.
 

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.980
And so some Welwitschias are
actually 100 or 200 feet high;

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.933
it's just that they're all
below ground and they just have

00:23:50.933 --> 00:23:53.058
these big leaves that come out
the top.

00:23:53.058 --> 00:23:58.334
So there are wonderful things
that are represented in the

00:23:58.334 --> 00:24:00.028
plant radiation.
 

00:24:00.028 --> 00:24:03.923
Okay, so the theme of that
basically--let me just go back

00:24:03.923 --> 00:24:06.220
and reinforce these two points.
 

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.849
Some of the stuff that you need
to get on land was developed

00:24:08.849 --> 00:24:10.836
earlier in the water,
for other reasons,

00:24:10.836 --> 00:24:13.028
and then was co-opted to get
you on land,

00:24:13.028 --> 00:24:17.190
and that's what probably
happened with the vertebrate

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.750
limb.
 

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.749
The plants developed much of
their diversity after they had

00:24:21.749 --> 00:24:23.058
gotten onto land.
 

00:24:23.058 --> 00:24:26.842
And you can see that they are
adding things like vascular

00:24:26.842 --> 00:24:30.759
canals and water delivery
systems and things like that--

00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:35.898
wood--at a fairly steady pace,
as you go up through a period

00:24:35.898 --> 00:24:39.818
between about 450 and 75 million
years ago.

00:24:39.818 --> 00:24:43.981
If we then look at large
patterns in the history of life,

00:24:43.981 --> 00:24:47.625
to see what kinds of messages
the fossils give us,

00:24:47.625 --> 00:24:50.450
this is one of the classical
ones.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:55.404
This is how many different
families of ammonites there

00:24:55.404 --> 00:24:56.059
were.
 

00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:57.058
Okay?
 

00:24:57.058 --> 00:25:03.390
And you can think of each of
these radiations,

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:07.376
that are presented as kind of a
leaf with grey coloring around

00:25:07.376 --> 00:25:10.503
it,
as being roughly at the level

00:25:10.503 --> 00:25:11.730
of an order.
 

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:16.431
So an order of mammals would
be--to make it familiar to

00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:20.348
you--would be something like the
ungulates.

00:25:20.348 --> 00:25:23.357
An order of birds would be
something like the albatrosses

00:25:23.357 --> 00:25:24.538
and their relatives.
 

00:25:24.538 --> 00:25:27.650
Fairly big groups with a lot of
species in them.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.732
And within each of these groups
you can see that there are lots

00:25:30.732 --> 00:25:31.430
of families.
 

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.618
Now look what happens to them.
 

00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:39.088
At the end of the--they start
to radiate,

00:25:39.088 --> 00:25:41.608
back in the Devonian--at the
end of the Devonian there's a

00:25:41.608 --> 00:25:44.517
mass extinction,
lots of them get cut off,

00:25:44.517 --> 00:25:46.750
two lineages come through.
 

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.932
This lineage radiates,
makes a whole lot of different

00:25:50.932 --> 00:25:53.828
species and families of
ammonites.

00:25:53.828 --> 00:25:57.368
At the end of the Permian,
they all go extinct.

00:25:57.368 --> 00:26:01.256
This line here manages to get
two of them through--two

00:26:01.256 --> 00:26:05.730
lineages, maybe three--through
the Permian mass extinction.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.789
One of them goes out in the
Triassic;

00:26:07.789 --> 00:26:09.608
the other radiates.
 

00:26:09.608 --> 00:26:12.038
At the end of the Triassic
there's a mass extinction.

00:26:12.038 --> 00:26:15.400
Almost all the ammonites
disappear again.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.307
One or two lineages get
through, into the Jurassic,

00:26:20.307 --> 00:26:25.313
and at the end of the
Cretaceous these two surviving

00:26:25.313 --> 00:26:28.160
branches both go extinct.
 

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.938
So people looked at that,
and what they saw was this

00:26:31.938 --> 00:26:34.934
continuing extinction,
and then re-radiation,

00:26:34.934 --> 00:26:36.510
and extinction,
and re-radiation,

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.116
and they asked themselves,
"Can the world hold only

00:26:40.116 --> 00:26:42.500
so many kinds of ammonites?
 

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.109
Does it kind of fill up,
and then when it's wiped clean,

00:26:46.109 --> 00:26:50.180
does that create a space for
the others to re-radiate?"

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.730
Well the pattern is consistent
with that interpretation.

00:26:56.058 --> 00:26:58.269
Consistency is a very weak
logical criterion;

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.160
but it's evocative.
 

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:07.308
So I leave it at that.
 

00:27:07.308 --> 00:27:12.960
Now that consistency comment's
going to apply to this as well.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.109
So this is the mammal radiation.
 

00:27:15.109 --> 00:27:16.230
Okay?
 

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.750
And when you look at it,
the first thing you notice is

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:23.338
oh, mammals started to radiate
back in the Triassic.

00:27:23.338 --> 00:27:26.019
If we were back in the Triassic
we might not have called them

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:29.811
mammals yet,
but they have already split off

00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:34.172
from other ancestors,
and it looks like things like

00:27:34.172 --> 00:27:38.470
the Monotremes have their roots
at about that level in time.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:40.950
So we're looking back about 200
million years.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.998
During the whole time that
dinosaurs were the dominant

00:27:50.998 --> 00:27:56.630
large creatures on the planet,
and the most diverse tetrapods,

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.368
the mammals continued to
radiate.

00:28:00.368 --> 00:28:02.950
There were multituberculates,
there were triconodonts;

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:05.259
there were all sorts of things,
back there.

00:28:05.259 --> 00:28:09.160
They tended to be rather small,
but they were perking along.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.838
Then there's the end-Cretaceous
extinction.

00:28:12.838 --> 00:28:17.582
Everything bigger than five
kilos that lives on land gets

00:28:17.582 --> 00:28:21.140
wiped out, and the mammals then
radiate.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.000
Well that is consistent with
the idea that the extinction of

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.925
the dinosaurs was a necessary
pre-condition for the radiation

00:28:28.925 --> 00:28:30.170
of the mammals.
 

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.345
And it looks like a reiteration
of the pattern we saw with the

00:28:34.345 --> 00:28:37.493
ammonites: clean the planet out
and make space,

00:28:37.493 --> 00:28:39.890
and then they can evolve again.
 

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:44.481
So this is really kind of a
tetrapod recapitulation of what

00:28:44.481 --> 00:28:46.700
we saw with the ammonites.
 

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.546
But, as I said,
consistency is a weak logical

00:28:51.546 --> 00:28:58.045
criterion, and the problem is
we're dealing with one planet,

00:28:58.045 --> 00:29:01.680
and we don't have replicates.
 

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.890
&gt;
 

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:05.826
It would be nice if we could
replicate this experiment a

00:29:05.826 --> 00:29:09.243
hundred times and see that every
time the dinosaurs went extinct,

00:29:09.243 --> 00:29:10.578
the mammals radiated.
 

00:29:10.578 --> 00:29:10.990
Okay?
 

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.450
We have a sample size of one.
 

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.009
So it's a very interesting
pattern.

00:29:16.009 --> 00:29:17.848
It might very well be true.
 

00:29:17.848 --> 00:29:20.131
It sounds plausible,
and you can't demonstrate it

00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:20.940
experimentally.
 

00:29:24.338 --> 00:29:27.848
So what are the groups that are
still radiating?

00:29:27.848 --> 00:29:31.497
If we just look around the
planet right now,

00:29:31.497 --> 00:29:32.940
what do we see?
 

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:38.078
Well the beetles are still
going like gangbusters.

00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:40.140
We don't actually know how many
beetles there are.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:46.758
The number of beetles that have
been named is I think about

00:29:46.758 --> 00:29:47.900
350,000.
 

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:53.500
The number of beetle species
that might exist could be on the

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.460
order of 5,000,000.
 

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.070
When J.B.S. Haldane,
who was an atheist Communist,

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:01.428
was having dinner with the wife
of the Archbishop of Canterbury,

00:30:01.428 --> 00:30:03.134
she asked him,
"Mr. Haldane,

00:30:03.134 --> 00:30:06.384
what do you conclude about the
nature of the creator from your

00:30:06.384 --> 00:30:08.250
study of biology?"
 

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.307
And he turned to her and said,
"Madame,

00:30:10.307 --> 00:30:12.319
an inordinate fondness of
beetles."

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:13.808
&gt;
 

00:30:13.808 --> 00:30:18.380
So there are a lot of beetles,
and they're still radiating.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.373
The Diptera,
the flies and the mosquitoes,

00:30:21.373 --> 00:30:24.730
are a young group,
and they are still producing

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:25.900
new species.
 

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:30.451
Among the mammals,
it's the bats that are probably

00:30:30.451 --> 00:30:34.631
the most impressive producers of
biodiversity,

00:30:34.631 --> 00:30:37.140
along with the rodents.
 

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:40.987
And the place where the bats
and the rodents are doing the

00:30:40.987 --> 00:30:43.348
most of this is in South
America.

00:30:43.348 --> 00:30:45.298
So if you really are a
mammalogist,

00:30:45.298 --> 00:30:49.353
and you want to study recent
evolution and see things that

00:30:49.353 --> 00:30:52.338
are still in the process of
speciating,

00:30:52.338 --> 00:30:54.509
South America is certainly one
good place,

00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:58.190
and the groups to look at are
bats and rodents.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:01.855
In the flowering plants,
there is really impressive

00:31:01.855 --> 00:31:06.400
biodiversity in the composites,
the orchids and the grasses.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.588
There are about 12,000 species
of orchids I think.

00:31:10.588 --> 00:31:14.198
And I have forgotten--Jeremy,
do you know the figures for the

00:31:14.198 --> 00:31:14.799
grasses?
 

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:16.259
Teaching Assistant:  Yes.
 

00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:18.519
I think there's somewhere
around 15,000.

00:31:18.519 --> 00:31:21.358
Prof: 15,000 species of
grasses and composites.

00:31:21.358 --> 00:31:23.828
Teaching Assistant:
 There's around 30,000.

00:31:23.828 --> 00:31:25.965
Prof: There are about
30,000, and they probably don't

00:31:25.965 --> 00:31:27.269
even call them composites
anymore.

00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.980
Teaching Assistant:  No.
 

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:28.920
Prof: What are they
called?

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.028
Teaching Assistant:
 Asteraceae.

00:31:30.028 --> 00:31:31.490
Prof: They're called
Asteraceae.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.266
Okay, see, the phylogeneticists
are busy, they're on their game,

00:31:34.266 --> 00:31:35.279
they're naming stuff.
 

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.259
Now that's---those are the
clades that are currently

00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:46.519
filling the world with life.
 

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:48.368
What about the stuff that's
been wiped out?

00:31:48.368 --> 00:31:51.138
Well all of those exotic things
in the Burgess Shale,

00:31:51.138 --> 00:31:53.588
they're gone forever,
and they've been gone for

00:31:53.588 --> 00:31:55.400
hundreds of millions of years.
 

00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:00.893
The trilobites,
the ammonites,

00:32:00.893 --> 00:32:03.690
the dinosaurs,
those are all gone.

00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.900
There was a wonderful group
called the glossopterids.

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:11.275
They were Jurassic tongue-ferns;
they were ferns that looked

00:32:11.275 --> 00:32:12.930
tongue-like.
 

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:16.587
There's a great story about how
when South America got connected

00:32:16.587 --> 00:32:18.768
to North America,
at the Isthmus of Panama,

00:32:18.768 --> 00:32:21.358
about 10 million years ago,
a bunch of tough,

00:32:21.358 --> 00:32:24.759
North American hoodlums
migrated south,

00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:26.978
over the Isthmus,
and ate up everything in South

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:27.450
America.
 

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.803
They were called things like
pumas and wolves and stuff like

00:32:31.803 --> 00:32:36.009
that, and they ate up the South
American notoungulates.

00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:37.940
There were a few things that
came north;

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.192
possums, armadillos came north,
but most of it was a movement

00:32:42.192 --> 00:32:42.759
south.
 

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:48.756
And so there was a complex
Miocene and Pliocene fossil

00:32:48.756 --> 00:32:54.298
fauna in South America that's
vanished forever.

00:32:54.298 --> 00:32:58.903
In the last 10,000 years,
mostly on islands in the

00:32:58.903 --> 00:33:04.538
Pacific, 25 to 35% of the
world's birds have gone extinct.

00:33:04.538 --> 00:33:08.140
And outside of Africa,
most of the Pleistocene

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.740
megafauna is gone.
 

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:11.528
If you want to see what the
Pleistocene looked like,

00:33:11.528 --> 00:33:15.057
go to a national park in
Africa, because that's what

00:33:15.057 --> 00:33:18.240
North America looked like 10,000
years ago,

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.068
when we had 300,400-pound
beavers;

00:33:21.068 --> 00:33:24.644
and there was a North American
lion that was bigger than an

00:33:24.644 --> 00:33:27.470
African lion;
and of course the mammoths and

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.130
the wooly rhinos and all of
those things.

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:35.578
So we are actually missing a
lot of this stuff.

00:33:35.578 --> 00:33:40.741
And, on the one hand,
none of us probably ever woke

00:33:40.741 --> 00:33:45.077
up in the middle of the night,
in a cold sweat,

00:33:45.077 --> 00:33:48.442
worrying about the fact that
the dinosaurs were extinct and

00:33:48.442 --> 00:33:50.298
we couldn't see them anymore.
 

00:33:50.298 --> 00:33:53.089
And some ornithologists,
who know about the recent

00:33:53.089 --> 00:33:55.710
history of extinction in the
world's birds,

00:33:55.710 --> 00:33:58.309
probably do occasionally wake
up in a cold sweat at two

00:33:58.309 --> 00:34:00.960
o'clock in the morning and worry
that they were gone.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.433
But most of this stuff,
we regard that as oh,

00:34:03.433 --> 00:34:05.910
it's in the drawers of the
Peabody Museum;

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.588
it's old, dusty fossils.
 

00:34:07.588 --> 00:34:10.452
But basically what we're
talking about here is vanished

00:34:10.452 --> 00:34:13.472
worlds;
vanished complete communities,

00:34:13.472 --> 00:34:17.456
vanished profligate,
extravagant radiations that

00:34:17.456 --> 00:34:20.846
produced life,
that filled up the planet,

00:34:20.846 --> 00:34:23.050
and then disappeared.
 

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:28.768
And 99% of it's gone;
we see a very small fraction

00:34:28.768 --> 00:34:29.989
that remains.
 

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:34.449
And that's actually just a fact
of life.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:35.610
Okay?
 

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:40.938
It doesn't actually necessarily
call for an emotional response,

00:34:40.938 --> 00:34:46.010
other than the observation that
hey, that's what happens.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:48.768
Now let's go back to one of
those places.

00:34:48.768 --> 00:34:51.489
This is a vanished community,
this is the Burgess Shale,

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.914
and about 500 million years
ago--the Burgess Shale is about

00:34:54.914 --> 00:34:58.420
505 million years old,
so it's sort of late-Cambrian.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:03.960
At that point--this is the
North American craton here;

00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:08.385
so looking at its western edge,
it's eastern edge would be

00:35:08.385 --> 00:35:11.958
Quebec, and then this would be
northern Canada,

00:35:11.958 --> 00:35:12.889
up here.
 

00:35:12.889 --> 00:35:14.018
This is the western edge.
 

00:35:14.018 --> 00:35:16.849
At that point it's slightly
south of the equator.

00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:20.402
It's not connected to South
America or to Asia,

00:35:20.402 --> 00:35:21.639
at that point.
 

00:35:21.639 --> 00:35:23.550
This is where it is today.
 

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:28.141
You're up at about 10,000 feet;
you're about two kilometers

00:35:28.141 --> 00:35:32.380
above sea level;
maybe 8000 feet.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.855
This is a geologist,
and this is a fossil from the

00:35:35.855 --> 00:35:36.989
Burgess Shale.
 

00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:39.239
That one happens to look like a
trilobite.

00:35:39.239 --> 00:35:39.596
Okay?
 

00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:41.590
And this is the shale here.
 

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:46.909
So at this site,
505 million years ago,

00:35:46.909 --> 00:35:48.730
on the western edge of the
continent,

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.342
there was a shallow water
community that was living on the

00:35:53.342 --> 00:35:56.054
edge of a cliff,
and occasionally the cliff

00:35:56.054 --> 00:35:58.072
would fall down,
the sediment on the cliff would

00:35:58.072 --> 00:36:00.130
fall down,
and it would bury things;

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.679
and that's what the shale
consists of.

00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:06.478
You're looking basically at a
landslide that buried a lot of

00:36:06.478 --> 00:36:07.130
stuff.
 

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:10.079
And these are the kinds of
things that it buried.

00:36:10.079 --> 00:36:11.949
So here is our priapulid.
 

00:36:11.949 --> 00:36:13.809
Here is Opabinia.
 

00:36:13.809 --> 00:36:17.737
Here is Anomolocaris;
it looks like a huge looming

00:36:17.737 --> 00:36:19.585
predator in that shot;
but remember,

00:36:19.585 --> 00:36:21.518
the biggest thing in the ocean
was that big,

00:36:21.518 --> 00:36:23.050
and that's this guy right here.
 

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.829
Here's one cruising in the
background.

00:36:26.829 --> 00:36:29.326
And these are some of the
creatures that you can pull out

00:36:29.326 --> 00:36:30.039
of that shale.
 

00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:31.369
This is one of the most
abundant.

00:36:31.369 --> 00:36:32.400
This is Marella.
 

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.719
This is a primitive arthropod.
 

00:36:35.719 --> 00:36:40.594
Now remember the HOX genes,
remember how to turn an

00:36:40.594 --> 00:36:43.130
onychophoran into a fly?
 

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.090
Well this is an intermediate
step.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:50.411
Basically you take a worm and
you start specifying that the

00:36:50.411 --> 00:36:54.449
forward segments are going to
form a head.

00:36:54.449 --> 00:36:56.260
So you get cephalization.
 

00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:00.068
You can see that it's putting
out gills and legs on most of

00:37:00.068 --> 00:37:03.043
its segments--
but it's kind of stopping to do

00:37:03.043 --> 00:37:06.918
that on its back segments--
and it's developed a hard

00:37:06.918 --> 00:37:08.030
exoskeleton.
 

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:15.230
So this is steps on the way to
becoming an arthropod.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.289
And we actually don't know
whether this thing is the

00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:21.409
ancestor of Crustaceans or of
the chelicerates or the

00:37:21.409 --> 00:37:22.309
trilobites.
 

00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:28.710
It's just an intermediate form
between a worm and an arthropod.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.650
This thing is just totally
bizarre.

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:31.860
This is Opabinia.
 

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:32.355
Okay?
 

00:37:32.355 --> 00:37:35.824
And when it was first
reconstructed,

00:37:35.824 --> 00:37:40.570
it resulted in hilarity;
nobody could believe it.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:46.766
And the thing that really gets
people about it is that it has

00:37:46.766 --> 00:37:49.396
five eyes,
and it's got this proboscis

00:37:49.396 --> 00:37:52.159
that's got kind of a grasping
organ out on the end of it.

00:37:52.159 --> 00:37:57.324
So it looks sort of like a
cross between a spider and a

00:37:57.324 --> 00:37:58.949
vacuum cleaner.
 

00:37:58.949 --> 00:38:00.360
It's probably about this big.
 

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:00.880
Okay?
 

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:04.530
It's about one or two inches
long.

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:09.230
And people just couldn't figure
out where Opabinia fits.

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:13.701
So Derek Briggs has made the
study of Opabinia one of his

00:38:13.701 --> 00:38:16.250
projects;
he knows a lot about it.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.260
And it appears to be related to
Crustacea.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.501
But again you can see that it
looks like it's intermediate

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:26.179
between a worm and something
else.

00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:31.168
So it's probably some kind of
intermediate form,

00:38:31.168 --> 00:38:33.929
prior to the arthropods.
 

00:38:33.929 --> 00:38:39.489
Now before I go on to stasis
and Cope's rule,

00:38:39.489 --> 00:38:47.449
I just want to comment a little
bit on what it means that entire

00:38:47.449 --> 00:38:52.630
communities have completely
vanished.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:57.409
It really places a very
relative view on the current

00:38:57.409 --> 00:38:58.159
world.
 

00:38:58.159 --> 00:39:01.034
When the Atlantic was
opening--and the Connecticut

00:39:01.034 --> 00:39:04.731
River Valley might have been the
Atlantic, or it could've been a

00:39:04.731 --> 00:39:08.056
river valley on a continent;
it was a rift valley at that

00:39:08.056 --> 00:39:11.155
time--there were a series of
rift valley lakes that stretched

00:39:11.155 --> 00:39:12.809
across eastern North America.
 

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:16.034
They run basically from
Pennsylvania up to about

00:39:16.034 --> 00:39:16.719
Vermont.
 

00:39:16.719 --> 00:39:19.807
And they opened and closed,
and opened and closed several

00:39:19.807 --> 00:39:20.250
times.
 

00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:22.230
Every time one of those lakes
opened,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.510
the fish in them went through a
big adaptive radiation,

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:27.025
like the ammonites did,
and then the lake closed and

00:39:27.025 --> 00:39:30.077
all the fish died off,
and then it opened up again and

00:39:30.077 --> 00:39:32.539
another radiation of fish went
on in it,

00:39:32.539 --> 00:39:36.864
and it closed up;
and this happened again and

00:39:36.864 --> 00:39:39.974
again and again,
both spatially and temporally,

00:39:39.974 --> 00:39:43.760
across the eastern United
States, about 200 million years

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.369
ago.
 

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.606
We're currently in the middle
of a big anthropogenic

00:39:55.606 --> 00:39:59.237
extinction crisis,
but it appears like this isn't

00:39:59.237 --> 00:40:03.349
something that the planet hasn't
experienced before.

00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:08.092
Geological processes have
caused many extinctions of

00:40:08.092 --> 00:40:11.530
entire communities,
wiped them completely off the

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.710
face of the earth,
and life has re-generated new

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.929
ones again and again and again
and again.

00:40:17.929 --> 00:40:21.192
So that was one of the messages
I'm hoping that you're getting

00:40:21.192 --> 00:40:22.530
from the fossil record.
 

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.920
Now what about stasis?
 

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.795
What about the fact that the
Coelacanth that you catch off

00:40:28.795 --> 00:40:32.710
the Comoro Islands today,
looks almost exactly like the

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.873
Coelacanth that's in the fossil
record from 360 million years

00:40:36.873 --> 00:40:37.360
ago?
 

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.664
What about the fact that the
Onychophorans that you collect

00:40:40.664 --> 00:40:43.572
in Australia today are
practically indistinguishable

00:40:43.572 --> 00:40:46.878
from the ones that you see in
the Burgess Shale 505 million

00:40:46.878 --> 00:40:47.789
years ago?
 

00:40:47.789 --> 00:40:50.309
Why is there stasis?
 

00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:54.019
And I mention this because if
you were to write down a list of

00:40:54.019 --> 00:40:57.610
the big intellectual problems
that are posed by fossils,

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.050
this is certainly going to be
on everybody's list.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.561
There are others,
but this is going to be a

00:41:03.561 --> 00:41:04.518
prominent one.
 

00:41:04.518 --> 00:41:07.990
And this is something that was
called to the attention of the

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:11.289
world's scientific community,
primarily by Steve Gould.

00:41:11.289 --> 00:41:14.889
This is one of the take-home
messages of his life.

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:18.643
So stasis basically describes a
long period with no

00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:20.369
morphological change.
 

00:41:20.369 --> 00:41:22.900
There's no apparent response to
selection.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:25.949
Evolution doesn't appear to be
going on.

00:41:25.949 --> 00:41:29.565
And it is puzzling,
because we know that every

00:41:29.565 --> 00:41:32.940
nucleotide sequence undergoes
mutations.

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.713
There is no way that you can
stop the production of genetic

00:41:36.713 --> 00:41:38.730
diversity in these organisms.
 

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:39.052
Okay?
 

00:41:39.052 --> 00:41:42.222
So for 350 million years
Coelacanths don't change,

00:41:42.222 --> 00:41:45.909
but probably every nucleotide
in their genome has mutated,

00:41:45.909 --> 00:41:47.849
over that period of time.
 

00:41:47.849 --> 00:41:51.396
So there's been opportunity for
change, but they have not

00:41:51.396 --> 00:41:52.030
changed.
 

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.182
The examples of this include
club mosses and liverworts,

00:41:55.182 --> 00:41:58.280
lungfish, Coelacanths,
the priapulids and phoronids.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.463
You saw the priapulids--I
pointed them out in the

00:42:01.463 --> 00:42:04.050
Cambrian- in the Burgess Shale
shot--

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:07.121
tuataras currently still
existing on an island off New

00:42:07.121 --> 00:42:09.590
Zealand,
and onychophorans;

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.730
there are others.
 

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:14.219
So here are a couple of
onychophorans.

00:42:14.219 --> 00:42:18.699
They're kind of intermediate
between annelids and arthropods;

00:42:18.699 --> 00:42:21.309
velvet worms.
 

00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:24.900
And here are two possible
explanations for stasis.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:28.500
There may very well be others,
but I want you to have at least

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.920
these two general ones in your
toolkit.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.266
And one is basically a
selectionist explanation for

00:42:34.266 --> 00:42:34.869
stasis.
 

00:42:34.869 --> 00:42:39.862
It says that most of the things
that we're talking about have

00:42:39.862 --> 00:42:44.355
some method where either a larva
or a seed can find the

00:42:44.355 --> 00:42:48.349
environment in which the adult
will do well.

00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:51.385
And so there is a selection of
an environment,

00:42:51.385 --> 00:42:54.353
early in life,
and that actually then selects

00:42:54.353 --> 00:42:58.400
the selection pressures that
will operate on the adults.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.969
We see the adults,
we don't see the larvae.

00:43:00.969 --> 00:43:03.420
Basically the larvae have been
wandering around the planet,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.764
searching out the environment
in which the adults will grow

00:43:06.764 --> 00:43:08.443
up,
for hundreds of millions of

00:43:08.443 --> 00:43:10.202
years;
and we know that marine larvae

00:43:10.202 --> 00:43:11.518
are extremely good at this.
 

00:43:11.518 --> 00:43:14.400
The Coelacanths,
we know that they're deep-sea

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:17.342
creatures;
they live down at about 600 to

00:43:17.342 --> 00:43:18.139
1000 feet.
 

00:43:18.139 --> 00:43:21.760
That's a fairly stable
environment.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.621
The club mosses,
that's a little harder to see

00:43:24.621 --> 00:43:26.018
how this would work.
 

00:43:26.018 --> 00:43:27.860
But at any rate,
this is one option.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:28.768
Okay?
 

00:43:28.768 --> 00:43:33.480
So this is one of our
alternative hypotheses.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:37.085
The reason things stay the same
is that young life history

00:43:37.085 --> 00:43:40.943
stages find the environment in
which adult selection will take

00:43:40.943 --> 00:43:43.518
place,
and adult selection is

00:43:43.518 --> 00:43:44.630
stabilizing.
 

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:47.679
Intermediate values are
selected for.

00:43:47.679 --> 00:43:49.530
Things don't change.
 

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.996
On the other hand,
there's a contrasting

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:55.159
hypothesis, which is an
internalist explanation.

00:43:55.159 --> 00:43:59.219
Basically it is that tradeoffs
are creating the stabilizing

00:43:59.219 --> 00:44:02.382
selection--
that's one possibility--so that

00:44:02.382 --> 00:44:06.740
instead of having an ecological
explanation for why there's a

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.719
long period of stabilizing
selection,

00:44:09.719 --> 00:44:13.338
we have an internal
physiological or developmental

00:44:13.338 --> 00:44:17.179
explanation of why selection has
been stabilizing.

00:44:17.179 --> 00:44:19.284
But there's another part,
another option in the

00:44:19.284 --> 00:44:22.929
internalist explanation,
and that is that early on,

00:44:22.929 --> 00:44:27.380
both in evolution and early on
in development,

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:31.900
key traits get fixed;
key things get set up.

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.572
The development of the eye
depends upon the relationship of

00:44:34.572 --> 00:44:37.588
two tissue layers,
so that there will always ever

00:44:37.588 --> 00:44:41.889
thereafter be nerves and blood
vessels in front of the retina.

00:44:41.889 --> 00:44:42.969
Okay?
 

00:44:42.969 --> 00:44:46.925
So if those things are laid
down early, both in evolution

00:44:46.925 --> 00:44:50.527
and then in development,
occur early in development,

00:44:50.527 --> 00:44:52.860
there's kind of an embedding.
 

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:56.873
That means things have been in
place that can't be changed

00:44:56.873 --> 00:44:59.690
without destroying normal
development.

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:03.840
Now there are arguments for and
against all of these things.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.990
You can find early
developmental traits that have

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.668
undergone a lot of evolution
without destroying the adult

00:45:10.668 --> 00:45:11.260
form.
 

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:14.496
So there are some real issues
with trying to understand the

00:45:14.496 --> 00:45:16.449
mechanics of how this would
work;

00:45:16.449 --> 00:45:18.230
and we don't know yet.
 

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.610
Okay?
 

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:22.880
I'm just giving you a few ideas
that bear on the issue.

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:26.632
The other major take-home
message is--that I've already

00:45:26.632 --> 00:45:28.369
signaled as Cope's Law.
 

00:45:28.369 --> 00:45:31.010
And again, there are two
options here.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:35.231
One is that the reason that we
see bigger things is that

00:45:35.231 --> 00:45:37.920
there's just a neutral
evolution.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:41.606
Adaptive radiations have been
creating little things and big

00:45:41.606 --> 00:45:42.170
things.
 

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.427
But there was more room on the
upper end than there was on the

00:45:45.427 --> 00:45:48.121
lower end;
therefore even though it's been

00:45:48.121 --> 00:45:51.233
random, we see an accumulation
of larger things,

00:45:51.233 --> 00:45:54.280
just because the upper limits
are far away.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.329
Okay?
 

00:45:55.329 --> 00:45:58.059
The lower limit on body size is
always nearby;

00:45:58.059 --> 00:46:01.302
it's one cell,
you don't get smaller than one

00:46:01.302 --> 00:46:01.820
cell.
 

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.474
But the upper limit appears to
be redwood trees and blue

00:46:04.474 --> 00:46:07.369
whales, and at least at the
outset that's pretty far away.

00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:10.907
That's up at about 100 meters,
for redwood trees,

00:46:10.907 --> 00:46:13.710
and about 30 meters for blue
whales.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.340
So that's one possibility.
 

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.579
The other is that the reason
that things got bigger is

00:46:19.579 --> 00:46:21.018
co-evolutionary.
 

00:46:21.018 --> 00:46:24.820
Co-evolution is shaping prey to
escape and predators to kill,

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:29.239
and prey can escape predators
by getting too big to eat,

00:46:29.239 --> 00:46:34.320
and predators can kill big prey
by getting bigger than they are.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:37.851
So this would be an adaptive
life history hypothesis,

00:46:37.851 --> 00:46:42.061
saying that Cope's law results
from a co-evolutionary arms race

00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:44.099
between predator and prey.
 

00:46:44.099 --> 00:46:47.806
And we don't really yet have a
powerful method for

00:46:47.806 --> 00:46:50.380
disentangling these two effects.
 

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.597
And I think if you look at
their logic, you can see that

00:46:52.597 --> 00:46:56.143
they're not mutually exclusive;
they can both be going on at

00:46:56.143 --> 00:46:57.329
the same time.
 

00:46:57.329 --> 00:47:01.210
Okay, so what does the fossil
record tell us?

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:05.688
It shows us a lot of stuff that
we couldn't see at shorter time

00:47:05.688 --> 00:47:06.340
scales.
 

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:10.710
We see a lot more detail in the
recent than in the distant past.

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:13.945
It looks like mass extinctions
may open up ecological space,

00:47:13.945 --> 00:47:16.139
for the radiation of surviving
groups.

00:47:16.139 --> 00:47:20.813
So it may be that you need an
extinction before you can have a

00:47:20.813 --> 00:47:22.039
big radiation.
 

00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:26.130
Most things start small and get
big.

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:29.532
And there's a lot of stuff
that's not on the planet at all

00:47:29.532 --> 00:47:32.228
anymore;
there are no surviving

00:47:32.228 --> 00:47:33.469
descendants.
 

00:47:33.469 --> 00:47:37.250
So the fossil record has a
take-home point,

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:41.170
that's actually a puzzle that
can be attacked experimentally,

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:43.751
in part by people doing
evolutionary developmental

00:47:43.751 --> 00:47:46.476
biology and phylogenetics,
and that is,

00:47:46.476 --> 00:47:48.570
why is there stasis?
 

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.123
It's common,
and we don't have an

00:47:51.123 --> 00:47:52.800
explanation for it.

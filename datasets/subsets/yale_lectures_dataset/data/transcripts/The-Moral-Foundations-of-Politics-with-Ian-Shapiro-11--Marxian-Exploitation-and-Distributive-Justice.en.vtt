00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.867
Prof: Okay,
we're going to pick up where we

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:11.300
left off with talking about Marx
last time.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:35.850
 
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.301
I was just talking to some of
the teaching fellows about how

00:00:39.301 --> 00:00:43.455
the sections went,
and it seemed like there was

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:47.869
some confusion or lack of,
what's the word,

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:53.360
lack of comfort with this
concept of exploitation in Marx.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.686
Just where does it come from
and how does exploitation occur

00:00:57.686 --> 00:01:01.500
when people are making voluntary
Pareto exchanges?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.629
And I think that is the right
question to zero in on,

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:09.777
and we're going to spend more
time on it both today and next

00:01:09.777 --> 00:01:12.456
time,
because it really is important

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:16.479
for Marx's argument to work that
exploitation is not about

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.819
cheating people.
 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.920
It's not about getting people
to do things involuntarily.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.427
The idea behind the concept of
exploitation is equivalent is

00:01:27.427 --> 00:01:29.489
exchanged for equivalent.
 

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:32.530
Use-values are voluntarily
exchanged.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.930
So another way of putting it,
if you like,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.062
is that the transaction between
the employer and the worker is a

00:01:41.062 --> 00:01:46.191
Pareto superior transaction,
and Marx is not claiming that

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:46.920
it isn't.
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.878
So then you might say,
"Well, what is this idea

00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:51.269
of exploitation?"
 

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:56.290
And we saw that in some ways
it's quite counterintuitive

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.849
because when we worked through
this,

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.575
the only way in which the
capitalist can increase his

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:09.484
productivity is by either
increases in what Marx called

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:13.510
absolute surplus value,
which is basically lengthening

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.968
the working day,
getting people to work harder.

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:19.502
There are obviously physical
limits to that and political

00:02:19.502 --> 00:02:20.069
limits.
 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.400
Workers are going to organize.
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.865
They're going to get the Ten
Hours Bill passed through

00:02:23.865 --> 00:02:25.400
Parliament, as they indeed did.
 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.750
And so then you get the other
approach,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.940
what he called increases in
relative surplus value,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.279
which is technological
innovation, so that the

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:41.990
capitalist can cover his wage
bill in less time.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:50.550
And so the necessary labor time
goes from four hours to three,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.943
and there's seven hours of
surplus labor time where the

00:02:54.943 --> 00:02:58.543
workers producing goods,
that when sold,

00:02:58.543 --> 00:03:02.381
produce value that is not
accrued to them,

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:03.128
okay?
 

00:03:03.128 --> 00:03:06.840
We saw there was something
counterintuitive here,

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.468
and we're going to come back to
that,

00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:13.853
in that most of you figured you
would choose three over two if

00:03:13.853 --> 00:03:18.460
you had to take one of them,
but that's actually a higher

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.930
rate of exploitation.
 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.543
And I started talking about the
assumptions about how people

00:03:23.543 --> 00:03:24.830
compare themselves.
 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.908
Remember the self-referential
versus other referential,

00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:30.020
and we'll come back to all of
that.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.568
But the point I want to make
first,

00:03:33.568 --> 00:03:37.270
and to get you just clearly to
understand,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.378
is that this kind of move,
increasing productivity by

00:03:43.378 --> 00:03:49.865
technological innovation,
Marx and modern economists all

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:55.298
agree is the thing that makes
capitalism dynamically

00:03:55.298 --> 00:03:56.788
productive.
 

00:03:56.788 --> 00:04:04.423
Because it's the pressure to
innovate that is created by

00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:11.223
capitalist competition that
leads to technological

00:04:11.223 --> 00:04:19.829
innovation and more and more
capital-intensive production.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.415
Because if you think about it,
the more you're spending on

00:04:24.415 --> 00:04:29.244
technology to make your labor
more productive the less you're

00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:33.747
spending on your wage bill,
and it's only living human

00:04:33.747 --> 00:04:37.899
labor-power that creates fresh
value according to Marx.

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:42.230
And so when we think about this
line moving this way we're

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.103
thinking about production
becoming ever more capital

00:04:46.103 --> 00:04:47.699
intensive, right?
 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.651
More and more spent on
technology to make the workers

00:04:52.651 --> 00:04:56.841
more productive,
and we should expect capital

00:04:56.841 --> 00:05:00.269
intensity to increase over time.
 

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:04.382
When you see Marx use phrases
like "the organic

00:05:04.382 --> 00:05:07.447
composition of capital
increases,"

00:05:07.447 --> 00:05:11.723
he's just saying that
production becomes steadily more

00:05:11.723 --> 00:05:13.660
capital intensive.
 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.497
Now you could say,
"Well, why is this

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:16.439
exploitation?"
 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.750
Marx wants to say--this is,
I think, at the end of the day

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.759
not a very plausible argument
for reasons we'll see on

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:25.819
Wednesday.
 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.939
He wants to say this is not a
moral argument.

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:30.839
This is not a normative
argument.

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:34.139
He's using it as a technical
term.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.052
And so the fact that people
don't feel more exploited in

00:05:38.052 --> 00:05:42.250
this circumstance than in this
is neither here nor there.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.274
It's true in the
class-in-itself sense that I

00:05:45.274 --> 00:05:48.370
talked about last time,
that they, objectively

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.639
speaking, are more exploited.
 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.053
He has an argument about why
they will eventually come to

00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:57.589
feel more exploited that we'll
attend to a little bit later

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.430
today,
but for right now he just wants

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.319
to say this is an objective
argument.

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:08.452
Now you could say,
"Well, so is the rate of

00:06:08.452 --> 00:06:11.120
exploitation the rate of
profit?"

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.060
And the answer is no.
 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.603
It's not the rate of profit
because the value that's created

00:06:18.603 --> 00:06:21.170
here,
the so-called variable capital,

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.310
which just covers the wage
bill,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.860
is separated out from capital
that is spent on everything

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.430
else.
 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.355
So it's true that the
capitalist's profit comes out of

00:06:33.355 --> 00:06:38.187
here, but so do rent,
research and development costs,

00:06:38.187 --> 00:06:41.440
advertising,
mail, you name it.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.920
So profit is some subset of
this but not the totality of it.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.315
So the rate of profit is not
the same thing as the rate of

00:06:51.315 --> 00:06:52.550
surplus value.
 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.000
And the rate of profit is also
not the same as the rate of

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.910
exploitation.
 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.810
But what he is assuming in the
concept of exploitation is that

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.632
the worker is producing some
value that ultimately accrues to

00:07:06.632 --> 00:07:08.160
the capitalist.
 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.867
Now I said to you,
when we started out talking

00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:16.892
about Marx, that just like the
neoclassical theorists he has a

00:07:16.892 --> 00:07:19.860
micro theory and a macro theory.
 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.779
You now know what the micro
theory is.

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:23.250
It's this story here.
 

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.689
You might think about it.
 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:29.480
This diagram is to Marx what
the Pareto diagram is to the

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.850
Pareto system.
 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.327
This is the micro story of
exploitation in the same way

00:07:35.327 --> 00:07:39.557
that the Pareto system is the
micro theory of market

00:07:39.557 --> 00:07:40.720
exchanges.
 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.540
But at the end of the day,
of course, there's a macro

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.790
theory as well.
 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.019
As I said, Marx,
like Adam Smith and David

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:53.040
Ricardo before him,
had an invisible hand theory.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:58.127
And I think the easiest way to
get a grip on his macro theory

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:02.877
is to talk about the five
sources of crisis in capitalist

00:08:02.877 --> 00:08:08.220
systems that he thought followed
from his analytical logic.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.100
And I'm just going to spell
them all out now.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:14.300
None of them is without its
problems,

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.281
and we'll come back to the
problems later today and mostly

00:08:18.281 --> 00:08:21.920
on Wednesday,
but I think it's better first

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.267
to see the argument in its
totality before we start

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:30.875
dismembering it and see what
survives and what doesn't

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:34.178
survive closer critical
scrutiny.

00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:42.163
So in the first instance one of
the possible sources of crisis

00:08:42.163 --> 00:08:45.830
is the existence of money.
 

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:50.899
Now money for Marx is a
commodity like anything else.

00:08:50.899 --> 00:08:53.496
This is, of course,
before the era of paper money

00:08:53.496 --> 00:08:54.850
and anything like that.
 

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.335
So money is gold or silver or
something like that,

00:08:58.335 --> 00:09:01.750
and it's a commodity like any
other commodity.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.580
Its value is determined by the
cost of producing it.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.785
So gold is valuable because it
takes a lot of work to dig it

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:13.210
up, basically,
and to refine it.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:17.495
Obviously for a commodity to
function as money it's got to

00:09:17.495 --> 00:09:19.450
have certain properties.
 

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.500
It's got to be easily divisible.
 

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:26.333
If we used sheep it'd be kind
of hard because if you want to

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:30.923
use one leg of a sheep to
represent three bottles of wine

00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:35.740
you'd have to kill the sheep,
wouldn't be very convenient.

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.644
So money has to be easily
divisible and not atrophy and

00:09:40.644 --> 00:09:42.370
things like that.
 

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.436
Those are its properties as a
use-value, if you like,

00:09:46.436 --> 00:09:50.346
but as an exchangeable
commodity it's like anything

00:09:50.346 --> 00:09:51.048
else.
 

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:56.208
But once you get a developed
market system it depends on

00:09:56.208 --> 00:10:00.160
money to function,
and there's the ever-present

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.690
possibility of liquidity crises
if people start hoarding money.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.705
And he thinks that in times of
anxiety and so on people will

00:10:09.705 --> 00:10:11.658
start to hoard money.
 

00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:13.759
We saw this,
if you remember,

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:18.037
during the financial crisis
last year where suddenly banks

00:10:18.037 --> 00:10:22.389
that had trusted one another for
decades and even centuries

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:26.740
stopped trusting one another and
wouldn't lend money to one

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.567
another in ways that they
regularly did because they

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:35.668
didn't know whether the other
party had the money to lend.

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:39.442
And there was a period of
several weeks where the entire

00:10:39.442 --> 00:10:43.352
financial system was in danger
of crashing simply from the

00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:47.538
liquidity crisis that sort of
was perched on top of the credit

00:10:47.538 --> 00:10:48.428
crisis.
 

00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:53.618
So once the system becomes
completely dependent on money as

00:10:53.618 --> 00:10:59.075
a medium of exchange there's the
ever-present possibility that

00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:04.889
people will hoard money and the
system will go into a crisis.

00:11:04.889 --> 00:11:12.590
Secondly, Marx thinks he's now
understood,

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.879
better than Smith and Ricardo
before him,

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:20.573
just why it is that there's a
declining tendency in the rate

00:11:20.573 --> 00:11:23.278
of profit in capitalist systems.
 

00:11:23.278 --> 00:11:28.658
And the answer is in the logic
of the system you've already

00:11:28.658 --> 00:11:31.070
worked your way through.
 

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:37.235
So if you go back here,
as we move down here to make

00:11:37.235 --> 00:11:41.710
the system more capital
intensive,

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:46.615
any given move increases
profitability for the person who

00:11:46.615 --> 00:11:47.580
makes it.
 

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:53.710
So if this is the status quo,
and it's a cotton factory and

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:59.206
the capitalist puts in a
spinning jenny and makes his

00:11:59.206 --> 00:12:04.070
wage bill more quickly than
anybody else,

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.960
that leads him to be able to
undercut his competitor,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.798
and so his profits will go up.
 

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:18.582
But all of the competitors will
then make exactly the same

00:12:18.582 --> 00:12:21.440
innovation themselves.
 

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.297
And then once you have
spinning-jennies throughout the

00:12:25.297 --> 00:12:29.518
cotton industry the claim is
that the rate of profit in the

00:12:29.518 --> 00:12:33.957
cotton industry will be lower
than before anybody had put in a

00:12:33.957 --> 00:12:36.700
spinning jenny,
okay?

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.715
So the idea is,
what you do at the margin to

00:12:39.715 --> 00:12:42.519
improve your profits as a
capitalist,

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:47.087
leads to the declining rate of
profit in the industry as a

00:12:47.087 --> 00:12:49.724
whole,
because as we become more and

00:12:49.724 --> 00:12:53.485
more capital intensive in the
production of cotton we have

00:12:53.485 --> 00:12:56.918
less and less living human
labor-power going into the

00:12:56.918 --> 00:13:00.730
production of cotton,
and it's only living human

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.778
labor-power that produces fresh
value.

00:13:03.778 --> 00:13:06.408
Now you might say,
"But doesn't the spinning

00:13:06.408 --> 00:13:08.269
jenny produce fresh value?"
 

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:10.580
Marx's argument is no.
 

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.528
The value of the spinning jenny
was determined by the labor to

00:13:14.528 --> 00:13:18.591
produce the spinning jenny,
and its value is transferred to

00:13:18.591 --> 00:13:20.809
the product,
but that's all.

00:13:20.809 --> 00:13:22.820
It doesn't produce new value.
 

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.850
It's only the living human
labor-power.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.269
And the way you need to think
about it is that that is less,

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:31.974
and less, and less,
of the capitalist's investment

00:13:31.974 --> 00:13:35.149
as a proportion of his total
investment.

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:39.139
So living human labor-power,
or variable capital,

00:13:39.139 --> 00:13:42.508
as Marx calls it,
is a diminishing proportion of

00:13:42.508 --> 00:13:46.163
what the capitalist has to
invest in order to remain

00:13:46.163 --> 00:13:47.308
competitive.
 

00:13:47.308 --> 00:13:51.264
And so over time profits are
going to diminish in very

00:13:51.264 --> 00:13:55.370
competitive industries because
they'll get more and more

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.490
productive.
 

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:00.927
And that's what we mean in the
modern world when we say there's

00:14:00.927 --> 00:14:04.220
very little margin in a
particular industry.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:08.870
If you want to go into making
something like salad dressing,

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:13.149
a very saturated market where
every gizmo has been tried,

00:14:13.149 --> 00:14:15.960
you're going to find miniscule
margins;

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.149
very, very hard.
 

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:22.767
And Marx thinks this is a
process going on economy-wide,

00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:27.721
and so that's why economy-wide,
the rate of profit gradually

00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:30.658
declines in capitalist systems.
 

00:14:30.658 --> 00:14:32.871
And as I said,
that's something that all of

00:14:32.871 --> 00:14:35.980
the classical economists thought
that they had observed,

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.373
and so any theory worth its
name was going to have to

00:14:40.373 --> 00:14:41.808
account for it.
 

00:14:41.808 --> 00:14:44.668
So that's the second source of
crisis,

00:14:44.668 --> 00:14:48.982
though, because as it becomes
harder and harder for

00:14:48.982 --> 00:14:54.158
capitalists to make a profit
many of them are going to go out

00:14:54.158 --> 00:14:55.538
of business.
 

00:14:55.538 --> 00:15:01.769
And that brings me to the third
source of crises in capitalist

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:07.284
systems, and it's basically that
competition eliminates

00:15:07.284 --> 00:15:08.918
competitors.
 

00:15:08.918 --> 00:15:15.046
So that the initial market
model he starts with is a

00:15:15.046 --> 00:15:20.423
perfectly competitive one,
but what he's saying is,

00:15:20.423 --> 00:15:23.456
of course,
over time people go out of

00:15:23.456 --> 00:15:27.950
business at the same time as
things are becoming more and

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.840
more and more capital
intensive--

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.432
another way of putting it is
the entry costs become very

00:15:34.432 --> 00:15:34.889
high.
 

00:15:34.889 --> 00:15:38.506
For instance,
in 1984 when the Challenger

00:15:38.506 --> 00:15:43.753
blew up there was a company
called Morton Thiokol that made

00:15:43.753 --> 00:15:49.000
the O-rings for the Challenger
on the rocket boosters.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.240
It turned out that the design
was faulty.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.788
Now you might say,
"Well, that was probably

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:59.788
the end of Morton Thiokol's
relationship with NASA.

00:15:59.788 --> 00:16:03.606
Having made such a terrible
error they would go to a

00:16:03.606 --> 00:16:05.029
competitor."
 

00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:06.428
But guess what?
 

00:16:06.428 --> 00:16:12.220
Morton Thiokol is still making
rocket boosters for NASA.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.205
Because the notion that I would
say to myself,

00:16:15.205 --> 00:16:19.120
"Hmm, looks like a good
business for me to get into.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.778
They're obviously no good at it.
 

00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:24.716
I'll go start making rocket
boosters for NASA,"

00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:28.500
is laughable because the entry
cost is so high.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.101
So that's an example,
pretty much,

00:16:31.101 --> 00:16:33.389
of a monopolistic industry.
 

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:36.384
So competition leads to
innovation, yes,

00:16:36.384 --> 00:16:40.455
but it also leads to the
elimination of competitors as

00:16:40.455 --> 00:16:44.678
production becomes more and more
capital intensive.

00:16:44.678 --> 00:16:47.984
And once you don't have
competitors you don't have a

00:16:47.984 --> 00:16:51.547
reason to innovate,
and the basic dynamic of

00:16:51.547 --> 00:16:56.624
capitalism starts to slow down
because monopoly capitalism

00:16:56.624 --> 00:17:01.879
doesn't have the same inbuilt
incentives for innovation.

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:06.166
Remember, the capitalist is not
afraid of the worker in Marx's

00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:06.730
story.
 

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.680
The capitalist is afraid of the
capitalist down the street,

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.732
and once there is no capitalist
down the street about to take

00:17:15.732 --> 00:17:19.692
his business away or her
business away then this

00:17:19.692 --> 00:17:23.230
competitive dynamic starts to
atrophy.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:27.423
So that's a third source of
crisis as far as he is

00:17:27.423 --> 00:17:28.450
concerned.
 

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:37.650
A fourth source of crisis that
Marx identifies,

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:41.288
and here he's pretty much
actually following Adam Smith,

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:45.866
the way you can think about it
most straightforwardly is the

00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:50.040
workers collectively,
if they pooled all of their

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.380
wages, couldn't buy what they
produce.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:57.808
The workers collectively can't
buy what they produce,

00:17:57.808 --> 00:18:02.599
and that being the case there's
going to be an endemic problem

00:18:02.599 --> 00:18:05.818
of weak demand in capitalist
economies.

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:10.380
There's not going to be enough
demand to satisfy.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:16.993
There's not going to be enough
demand to satisfy the needs of

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:22.726
the system in order for
everything that's produced to

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:24.160
get sold.
 

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.359
Big problem.
 

00:18:26.359 --> 00:18:30.115
You could say, "Well,
doesn't that just mean wages

00:18:30.115 --> 00:18:33.425
will rise,"
and indeed it does put some

00:18:33.425 --> 00:18:36.998
upward pressure on wages,
but as we said,

00:18:36.998 --> 00:18:42.083
wages are basically going to be
held around subsistence by

00:18:42.083 --> 00:18:46.435
unemployment,
and so there's not much scope

00:18:46.435 --> 00:18:48.098
for that, right?
 

00:18:48.098 --> 00:18:54.998
Because if wages start to rise
you're then going to have the

00:18:54.998 --> 00:19:01.430
problem that any capitalist
who's not in the system,

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.407
or would be capitalist,
or want to be capitalist is

00:19:04.407 --> 00:19:07.506
going to come and hire
unemployed workers to work for

00:19:07.506 --> 00:19:09.829
him or her and so drive wages
down.

00:19:09.829 --> 00:19:12.000
So this is a problem.
 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.798
It's why Adam Smith thought you
got imperialism,

00:19:15.798 --> 00:19:20.127
and indeed Marx and Lenin after
him all thought one of the

00:19:20.127 --> 00:19:24.608
reasons you get imperialism is
to find markets for the goods

00:19:24.608 --> 00:19:26.278
that are produced.
 

00:19:26.278 --> 00:19:29.618
There were other reasons too,
cheap resources and so on,

00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:32.630
but one of the reasons is the
search for new markets,

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.972
more demand,
but that's a process which has

00:19:35.972 --> 00:19:40.192
obvious limits because
eventually your empire is going

00:19:40.192 --> 00:19:44.125
to bump into the French empire,
and the Belgian empire,

00:19:44.125 --> 00:19:46.057
and the German empire,
and you're going to fill up the

00:19:46.057 --> 00:19:47.990
world,
and then what do you do?

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:52.107
So you can stave it off with
imperialism, but the basic

00:19:52.107 --> 00:19:56.760
underlying problem is that the
workers collectively cannot buy

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.440
what they produce.
 

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.920
Now we see this sort of dynamic
plays out in some ways during

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.400
recessions when there's not
enough demand in the economy,

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.009
and of course there are things
you can do about it.

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:12.538
You can do what we did in The
Great Depression.

00:20:12.538 --> 00:20:17.568
The government can borrow money
and basically give it to

00:20:17.568 --> 00:20:22.598
unemployed people by hiring them
to do public works,

00:20:22.598 --> 00:20:25.558
and then they spend it and
stimulate demand,

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:29.957
or they can try what we've been
trying to do in the last year

00:20:29.957 --> 00:20:30.910
and a half.
 

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.654
They can try and get the banks
to give credit to people to buy

00:20:35.654 --> 00:20:37.990
things and stimulate demand.
 

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:41.470
But it's a basic structural
problem,

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:47.479
Marx thinks,
built into the system by the

00:20:47.479 --> 00:20:55.592
very fact that the workers
collectively cannot purchase

00:20:55.592 --> 00:21:00.549
everything that they produce.
 

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:03.615
Now you could say, "Well,
these are all sort of

00:21:03.615 --> 00:21:06.640
tendencies, but there are
counter tendencies as well,

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.891
and these problems can be
staved off,"

00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:11.410
imperialism being an example of
staving off,

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:13.818
the one I've just discussed.
 

00:21:13.818 --> 00:21:18.416
And Marx is not particularly
clear on just which one of these

00:21:18.416 --> 00:21:21.328
problems is supposed to be
decisive.

00:21:21.328 --> 00:21:26.276
Rather, what he thinks is
they'll all sort of kick in and

00:21:26.276 --> 00:21:31.663
start to make the system creak
at the joints and not work very

00:21:31.663 --> 00:21:32.460
well.
 

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:38.503
And as that starts to happen,
workers will start to get mad

00:21:38.503 --> 00:21:44.340
because they will start to
discover that the system isn't

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.509
giving them any particular
benefits;

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:51.511
the famous line towards the end
of The Communist

00:21:51.511 --> 00:21:54.996
Manifesto that you all read:
"Workers will come to

00:21:54.996 --> 00:21:58.960
realize that they have nothing
to lose but their chains."

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:03.220
The system that has given them
certain benefits will give them

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.781
fewer and fewer benefits as
competition becomes more

00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:07.759
cutthroat.
 

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:11.839
Their employers are working
with narrower and narrower

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:12.608
margins.
 

00:22:12.608 --> 00:22:18.055
They're unable to buy the
luxury goods that they see all

00:22:18.055 --> 00:22:22.018
around them,
and so they'll start to become

00:22:22.018 --> 00:22:24.915
angry,
and that leads us to the

00:22:24.915 --> 00:22:30.320
discussion we had last time
where we see that Marx wants to

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:35.074
say that their declining
relative share of the total

00:22:35.074 --> 00:22:40.200
product is eventually going to
make them militant.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.880
And so the image is of a system
becoming less and less dynamic,

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.288
a smaller and smaller number of
monopolies in every industry,

00:22:50.288 --> 00:22:53.726
capitalists who are going out
of business falling down into

00:22:53.726 --> 00:22:57.400
the working class bringing all
their resentments with them,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.739
and finally the system starts
to reach the point where it just

00:23:01.739 --> 00:23:05.996
can't function,
and that's when he thinks the

00:23:05.996 --> 00:23:11.950
socialist revolution becomes
both possible and necessary.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:16.338
And so you will get some sort
of revolutionary moment,

00:23:16.338 --> 00:23:22.038
and the workers will take over
the state,

00:23:22.038 --> 00:23:25.953
and the small remaining number
of monopoly capitalists will be

00:23:25.953 --> 00:23:30.662
put out of business,
the means of production will be

00:23:30.662 --> 00:23:35.250
nationalized and then socialism
will exist.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:39.038
So that's the story that he's
telling.

00:23:39.038 --> 00:23:43.394
Now I want to zero in on a few
features of socialism and

00:23:43.394 --> 00:23:47.619
communism before we start,
and then we'll come back and

00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:50.930
talk about the difficulties with
this argument.

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.646
Socialism for Marx is not an
equilibrium any more than

00:23:54.646 --> 00:23:55.769
capitalism is.
 

00:23:55.769 --> 00:24:01.146
Socialism is not a system that
is without its own internal

00:24:01.146 --> 00:24:04.450
contradictions according to
Marx.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.970
And the reason is as he says
here,

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:11.028
What we have to deal with is a
communist society,

00:24:11.028 --> 00:24:13.259
not as it has developed on its
own foundations,

00:24:13.259 --> 00:24:16.315
but, on the contrary,
just as it emerges from a

00:24:16.315 --> 00:24:19.744
capitalist society;
which is thus in every respect,

00:24:19.744 --> 00:24:22.890
economically,
morally, and intellectually,

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:26.825
still stamped with the
birthmarks of the old society

00:24:26.825 --> 00:24:29.140
from whose womb it emerges.
 

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.839
Accordingly,
(now he's talking about after a

00:24:32.839 --> 00:24:37.400
socialist revolution) the
individual producer receives

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.017
back from society--
after the deductions have been

00:24:41.017 --> 00:24:44.048
made--
exactly what he gives to it.

00:24:44.048 --> 00:24:49.432
So another way you might put
this is workmanship is no longer

00:24:49.432 --> 00:24:50.779
hypocritical.
 

00:24:50.779 --> 00:24:56.994
Under socialism the worker
really gets back what he's put

00:24:56.994 --> 00:24:57.548
in.
 

00:24:57.548 --> 00:25:01.265
"He receives a certificate
from society that he's furnished

00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:04.922
such-and-such an amount of labor
(after deducting his labor for

00:25:04.922 --> 00:25:09.267
the common funds);
and with this certificate,

00:25:09.267 --> 00:25:16.416
he draws from the social stock
of means of consumption as much

00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:21.338
as the same amount of labor
cost."

00:25:21.338 --> 00:25:27.280
So you have what he describes
here as the rights that workers

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:33.598
get to what they've produced,
he says, it's "still in

00:25:33.598 --> 00:25:35.848
principle--
bourgeois right,

00:25:35.848 --> 00:25:39.390
although principle and practice
are no longer at loggerheads,

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.396
while the exchange of
equivalents in commodity

00:25:42.396 --> 00:25:45.672
exchange exists only on the
average and not in the

00:25:45.672 --> 00:25:47.410
individual case."
 

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:50.821
Don't worry about that last
phrase, but what he's saying

00:25:50.821 --> 00:25:53.987
here is that principle and
practice are no longer at

00:25:53.987 --> 00:25:54.980
loggerheads.
 

00:25:54.980 --> 00:26:00.169
What he means is the worker is
being recompensed for his work,

00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.848
right?
 

00:26:00.848 --> 00:26:07.126
Whereas, under capitalism the
worker appears to be being

00:26:07.126 --> 00:26:13.061
recompensed for his work,
but in fact some of what he

00:26:13.061 --> 00:26:17.970
produces is accruing to the
capitalist.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.278
So that's the difference.
 

00:26:19.278 --> 00:26:23.019
Principle and practice are at
loggerheads under capitalism.

00:26:23.019 --> 00:26:26.500
It professes the idea that
we're entitled to what we make,

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.440
whereas under socialism we,
in fact,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.450
do get what we make,
and in that sense,

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:39.098
socialism is an advance on
capitalism.

00:26:39.098 --> 00:26:42.253
But he says,
"In spite of this advance,

00:26:42.253 --> 00:26:45.994
the equal right is still
constantly stigmatized as a

00:26:45.994 --> 00:26:47.828
bourgeois limitation.
 

00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:52.340
The right of the producers is
proportional to the labor they

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.169
supply;
the equality consists in the

00:26:55.169 --> 00:26:59.143
fact that measurement is made
with an equal standard,

00:26:59.143 --> 00:27:00.289
labor."
 

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:02.618
Now what does all that mean?
 

00:27:02.618 --> 00:27:07.323
It's rather contorted language,
but just look at a little more

00:27:07.323 --> 00:27:11.511
of the contorted language,
and then I'll explain in words

00:27:11.511 --> 00:27:13.528
of one syllable what it means.
 

00:27:13.528 --> 00:27:16.390
This is from The Critique of
the Gotha Programme,

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:21.045
and what he wants to say is
even if you reward people

00:27:21.045 --> 00:27:23.653
equally,
even if you reward people

00:27:23.653 --> 00:27:27.483
equally for their work,
there's going to be inequality

00:27:27.483 --> 00:27:28.660
in the society.
 

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:32.376
So he says, look,
One man is superior to another

00:27:32.376 --> 00:27:36.134
physically, or mentally,
and supplies more labor in the

00:27:36.134 --> 00:27:40.308
same time (works harder),
or can labor for a longer time;

00:27:40.308 --> 00:27:43.829
and labor, to serve as a
measure, must be defined by its

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:46.967
duration or intensity,
otherwise it ceases to be a

00:27:46.967 --> 00:27:48.759
standard of measurement.
 

00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:53.298
This equal right is an unequal
right for unequal labor.

00:27:53.298 --> 00:27:56.468
So if some of us are stronger
than others and we get paid

00:27:56.468 --> 00:28:00.087
according to how much work we do
some of us are going to get more

00:28:00.087 --> 00:28:01.390
than others, right?
 

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:03.230
"An equal right to unequal
labor."

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:07.116
It recognizes no class
differences, because everyone is

00:28:07.116 --> 00:28:11.578
only a worker like everyone else
(once we get to socialism);

00:28:11.578 --> 00:28:18.461
but it tacitly recognizes
unequal individual endowment,

00:28:18.461 --> 00:28:25.470
and thus productive capacity,
as a natural privilege.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.615
It is, therefore,
a right of inequality,

00:28:28.615 --> 00:28:31.440
in its content,
like every right.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.944
Right, by its very nature,
can consist only in the

00:28:34.944 --> 00:28:37.450
application of an equal
standard;

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.942
but unequal individuals (and
they would not be different

00:28:40.942 --> 00:28:44.689
individuals if they were not
unequal) are measurable only by

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:48.435
an equal standard insofar as
they are brought under an equal

00:28:48.435 --> 00:28:52.075
point of view,
are taken from one definite

00:28:52.075 --> 00:28:53.963
side only--
for instance,

00:28:53.963 --> 00:28:57.157
in the present case,
are regarded only as workers

00:28:57.157 --> 00:28:59.619
and nothing more is seen in
them,

00:28:59.619 --> 00:29:01.598
everything else being ignored.
 

00:29:01.598 --> 00:29:06.009
Further, one worker is married,
another is not;

00:29:06.009 --> 00:29:10.308
one has more children than
another, and so on and so forth.

00:29:10.308 --> 00:29:13.230
Thus, with an equal performance
of labor,

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:17.769
and hence an equal in the
social consumption fund,

00:29:17.769 --> 00:29:20.568
one will in fact receive more
than another,

00:29:20.568 --> 00:29:24.180
one will be richer than
another, and so on.

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:28.090
So if you think about a system
in which there is no longer a

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.128
capitalist,
but people are rewarded on the

00:29:31.128 --> 00:29:35.137
basis of work there's still
going to be inequality because

00:29:35.137 --> 00:29:39.848
some people have more effective
capacities to work than others,

00:29:39.848 --> 00:29:44.423
and because some people have
more demands on them than

00:29:44.423 --> 00:29:45.200
others.
 

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.296
If you have more children to
feed than somebody else earning

00:29:49.296 --> 00:29:52.003
the same amount,
it's going to leave you

00:29:52.003 --> 00:29:53.740
relatively worse off.
 

00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:00.321
So socialism is not a condition
of equality because there is

00:30:00.321 --> 00:30:03.670
this right based upon labor.
 

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:07.888
And he says,
These defects are inevitable in

00:30:07.888 --> 00:30:13.875
the first phase of a communist
society (which is socialism) as

00:30:13.875 --> 00:30:19.566
it is when it has just emerged
of the prolonged birth pangs

00:30:19.566 --> 00:30:22.509
from capitalist society.
 

00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:25.467
Right can never be higher than
the economic structure of

00:30:25.467 --> 00:30:28.640
society and its cultural
development conditioned thereby.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.670
In a higher phase of communist
society,

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:34.560
after the enslaving
subordination of the individual

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.270
to the division of labor,
and therewith also,

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:40.200
the antithesis between mental
and physical labor,

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.358
has vanished;
after labor has become not only

00:30:43.358 --> 00:30:46.000
a means of life but life's prime
want;

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.882
after the productive forces
have increased with the

00:30:48.882 --> 00:30:51.420
all-around development of the
individual,

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:53.992
and all the springs of
co-operative wealth flow more

00:30:53.992 --> 00:30:56.506
abundantly--
only then can the narrow

00:30:56.506 --> 00:31:00.721
horizon of bourgeois right be
crossed in its entirety and

00:31:00.721 --> 00:31:05.086
society inscribe on its banners:
From each according to his

00:31:05.086 --> 00:31:10.180
ability,
to each according to his needs!

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.564
"From each according to
his ability, to each according

00:31:13.564 --> 00:31:17.304
to his needs;"
that is the definition of the

00:31:17.304 --> 00:31:20.858
distributive principle under
communism,

00:31:20.858 --> 00:31:24.551
whereas under socialism it's
"from each according to his

00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:30.548
ability,
to each according to his

00:31:30.548 --> 00:31:33.210
work."
 

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.836
So socialism is not
hypocritical with respect to the

00:31:36.836 --> 00:31:39.775
workmanship ideal,
because unlike capitalism the

00:31:39.775 --> 00:31:41.670
workers get rewarded for their
work,

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:45.146
but it's still an unequal
society because people are

00:31:45.146 --> 00:31:47.960
differently abled,
and people have different

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.900
demands to meet.
 

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:53.626
And so finally we have to get
to the abolition of the very

00:31:53.626 --> 00:31:58.105
idea of rights in order to get
to the communist idea of

00:31:58.105 --> 00:32:01.920
"from each according to his
ability,

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.470
to each according to his
needs."

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.298
So that's the Marxian story.
 

00:32:07.298 --> 00:32:10.272
I'm sorry I put such long
quotations up there,

00:32:10.272 --> 00:32:13.840
but I think you need them to
get a flavor of how he was

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.890
actually thinking about it.
 

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:19.035
There are these interaction
crises all of them making one

00:32:19.035 --> 00:32:21.746
another worse,
declining profits,

00:32:21.746 --> 00:32:26.214
liquidity crisis,
more and more militant workers,

00:32:26.214 --> 00:32:28.240
and so on and so forth.
 

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.067
Finally you get an increase in
consciousness,

00:32:31.067 --> 00:32:32.740
this socialist takeover.
 

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:37.583
It's still an unequal system,
but it has the capacity for

00:32:37.583 --> 00:32:42.176
superabundance,
"For cooperative wealth to

00:32:42.176 --> 00:32:47.760
flow more abundantly,"
and so we can abolish the idea

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:53.051
of right completely and just
distribute on the basis of

00:32:53.051 --> 00:32:54.130
needs.
 

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:59.622
Now I want to start digging
into this in a critical way to

00:32:59.622 --> 00:33:04.730
show you all of the things that
are wrong with it,

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:08.390
but this is in the spirit of
how we treated utilitarianism.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.085
That is to say,
we're going to see all of the

00:33:11.085 --> 00:33:13.720
things that are wrong with his
argument,

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.528
in the same way that we did
with Bentham and Mill,

00:33:16.528 --> 00:33:20.259
in order then to see if there's
any surviving intuition.

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:26.019
And I want to start with this
concept of needs.

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:29.480
 
 

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:36.220
One of the reasons Marx and his
followers were so focused on

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:42.502
needs was that they were
convinced that in order to keep

00:33:42.502 --> 00:33:48.307
itself going,
capitalism manufactures

00:33:48.307 --> 00:33:52.710
pseudo-wants all the time.
 

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.631
We already saw there's this
problem with insufficient

00:33:56.631 --> 00:33:57.308
demand.
 

00:33:57.308 --> 00:33:59.940
You've got to get people to
want things.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:06.997
You've got to get people to
believe if you don't have the

00:34:06.997 --> 00:34:12.289
latest whatever-it-is,
you're a schmuck.

00:34:12.289 --> 00:34:15.489
My son looks at my Blackberry
Tour and he says,

00:34:15.489 --> 00:34:18.409
"How can you use a phone
like that?

00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:20.960
Nobody uses those anymore.
 

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.463
You've got to have a Google
phone, and if you don't have a

00:34:23.463 --> 00:34:25.659
Google phone you're just a
complete loser."

00:34:25.659 --> 00:34:27.949
That's his view of the matter.
 

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.954
And because there's this
problem of weak demand there's

00:34:31.954 --> 00:34:35.960
this built in emphasis to
constantly manufacture demand

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.409
for things that nobody needs.
 

00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:45.148
But the impulse to create all
of these phony needs will go

00:34:45.148 --> 00:34:51.059
away once you don't need
capitalism to innovate.

00:34:51.059 --> 00:34:53.869
So once you don't have
capitalism, you don't need

00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:57.324
people to constantly think that
they have to have the latest

00:34:57.324 --> 00:34:57.909
gizmo.
 

00:34:57.909 --> 00:35:03.161
You don't need to try and get
people to think of the 27 kinds

00:35:03.161 --> 00:35:06.750
of dishwashing liquid in Stop
and Shop.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.518
This one's better than that one.
 

00:35:08.518 --> 00:35:12.780
All these manufactured
artificial needs are an artifact

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:17.199
of the problem that we have to
keep capitalism going,

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:21.699
and once that goes away we can
think about people having finite

00:35:21.699 --> 00:35:22.280
needs.
 

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:31.684
And so if society reaches a
certain level of abundance then

00:35:31.684 --> 00:35:35.739
those needs can be met.
 

00:35:35.739 --> 00:35:38.849
Who thinks that's a terrible
argument?

00:35:38.849 --> 00:35:40.760
Okay, what's bad about it?
 

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:48.780
Take the--over here, yeah?
 

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.266
Student:  It just
doesn't seem like a good model

00:35:51.266 --> 00:35:54.170
of human nature and it puts a
limit on how much you can want.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.150
Prof: It what?
 

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.099
Student:  It puts a
limit on how much you can want.

00:35:57.099 --> 00:36:01.030
It seems like everyone has to
want the same amount of things.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:04.090
Prof: I think those are
good points.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:06.210
What else is wrong with it?
 

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:11.536
I mean, surely it's true that
some of the things--there is a

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:16.681
difference between wants and
needs, and a lot of our wants

00:36:16.681 --> 00:36:19.389
are very frivolous,
right?

00:36:19.389 --> 00:36:22.619
There are a lot of things that
we want.

00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:26.782
A neoclassical system doesn't
differentiate because we don't

00:36:26.782 --> 00:36:30.309
allow interpersonal judgments of
utility, right?

00:36:30.309 --> 00:36:36.320
So Trump thinks that he needs
the next hundred million dollars

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.396
and you might say,
"He might want it,

00:36:39.396 --> 00:36:40.710
but he doesn't need it."
 

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:45.230
But what's wrong with that?
 

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.681
I just want you to elaborate on
what you were saying,

00:36:48.681 --> 00:36:52.199
or somebody else elaborate on
what you were saying.

00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:54.650
Yeah?
 

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:58.393
Student:  It's hard to
know how the government will

00:36:58.393 --> 00:37:01.679
decide what people need and what
they just want.

00:37:01.679 --> 00:37:04.849
Prof: You're troubled by
the idea of the government

00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:08.018
deciding what people will need
and what they just want.

00:37:08.018 --> 00:37:11.550
I think that's fair enough,
but I think Marx in his most

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.081
utopian moments--
after all, one of the

00:37:14.081 --> 00:37:17.139
differences between socialism
and communism is,

00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:19.050
there is no government under
communism.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.150
There's a withering away of the
state.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.697
So his idea,
I think, is there's just going

00:37:23.697 --> 00:37:27.336
to be all this super--all these
goodies everywhere and people

00:37:27.336 --> 00:37:29.400
will just take what they need.
 

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.186
Student:  Where does the
abundance come from,

00:37:32.186 --> 00:37:32.458
also?
 

00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:33.880
That's another problem.
 

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.380
Prof: It's been made
possible by capitalism.

00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:38.929
The productivity of capitalism
will have...

00:37:38.929 --> 00:37:41.981
Student:  And then it
gets used up and then there's no

00:37:41.981 --> 00:37:43.659
more capitalism to create more.
 

00:37:43.659 --> 00:37:48.074
Prof: Okay,
so you're saying we might go to

00:37:48.074 --> 00:37:52.130
superabundance,
but then fall back from it.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:57.559
Yeah, I think those are good
criticisms.

00:37:57.559 --> 00:37:59.869
So why will there be continuing
abundance?

00:37:59.869 --> 00:38:03.478
I think that's a fair
criticism, but I think there's a

00:38:03.478 --> 00:38:05.929
more fundamental problem with
it,

00:38:05.929 --> 00:38:13.840
and that is in distinguishing
wants from needs you could say,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:18.155
"Look,"-- even before
you get to those problems which

00:38:18.155 --> 00:38:21.219
you both raised serious
questions for it,

00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:24.300
but even before you get to
those questions,

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.079
somebody might say, "Look.
 

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:31.666
We can at least define needs by
what people require in order to

00:38:31.666 --> 00:38:33.110
survive."
 

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.775
Surely if we want to
distinguish wants from needs we

00:38:36.775 --> 00:38:40.655
make a distinction between
things that if you don't get

00:38:40.655 --> 00:38:44.894
them you're going to die versus
things that if you don't get

00:38:44.894 --> 00:38:47.769
them you might not be that
happy,

00:38:47.769 --> 00:38:49.440
but you're not going to die.
 

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.579
What about that?
 

00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:57.619
Who thinks that that would
solve Marx's problem?

00:38:57.619 --> 00:38:59.489
Anybody?
 

00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:00.657
Why wouldn't it?
 

00:39:00.657 --> 00:39:02.409
Who thinks it wouldn't?
 

00:39:02.409 --> 00:39:06.403
You just said we're going to
reach a level of productivity

00:39:06.403 --> 00:39:10.679
where we can produce what people
need in order to survive,

00:39:10.679 --> 00:39:15.340
and then we could get rid of
the regime of rights.

00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:19.672
I think Marx makes a very valid
point when he says,

00:39:19.672 --> 00:39:24.699
"Any regime of rights is a
regime of inequality."

00:39:24.699 --> 00:39:25.480
Yeah?
 

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.554
Student:  Well,
I think that's kind of keeping

00:39:27.554 --> 00:39:29.510
with the same thing they had
during capitalism.

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.485
Like if it's still just
subsistence level,

00:39:31.485 --> 00:39:34.039
if that's what you need then
that's the same thing the

00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:35.630
workers had under capitalism.
 

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:39.454
It's not really making
communism a better society for

00:39:39.454 --> 00:39:40.409
the people.
 

00:39:40.409 --> 00:39:43.576
Prof: Okay,
so you're saying a world in

00:39:43.576 --> 00:39:48.010
which people only meet their
needs may not be a better world.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:48.860
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:52.056
Prof: Okay,
I think that might be a fair

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:52.889
criticism.
 

00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:57.731
He wants to say the alternative
is that we're all like these

00:39:57.731 --> 00:40:02.655
rats on wheels running faster
and faster to get less and less

00:40:02.655 --> 00:40:03.639
benefit.
 

00:40:03.639 --> 00:40:09.077
So unless we can accept
finitude, that we live for a

00:40:09.077 --> 00:40:13.978
fixed time,
and if we can't come to grips

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:21.268
with the fact that we are finite
creatures we're never going to

00:40:21.268 --> 00:40:22.679
be happy.
 

00:40:22.679 --> 00:40:25.478
So I think that's the debate
that he would want to have with

00:40:25.478 --> 00:40:28.673
you,
but I think that even within

00:40:28.673 --> 00:40:34.813
Marx's own terms of reference
there's a different problem and

00:40:34.813 --> 00:40:36.449
that is this.
 

00:40:36.449 --> 00:40:38.360
Suppose you said,
"All right,

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.226
we'll grant you,
as a matter of the philosophy

00:40:41.226 --> 00:40:43.264
of it,
we'll grant you,

00:40:43.264 --> 00:40:48.670
Karl Marx, the proposition that
needs are defined by what is

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:53.971
necessary for people's survival,
and that they should somehow be

00:40:53.971 --> 00:40:59.155
more important than Trump--
frivolous wants that might make

00:40:59.155 --> 00:41:02.938
life better,
but still in-all making my life

00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:07.164
better by letting me have a nice
car is less important than

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:10.954
preventing somebody from
starving when it really gets

00:41:10.954 --> 00:41:12.119
down to it.
 

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:15.373
And so we could make this
distinction between needs and

00:41:15.373 --> 00:41:16.699
wants in that sense.
 

00:41:16.699 --> 00:41:19.320
But here's the problem.
 

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:25.414
Even if we're only trying to
meet people's needs defined in

00:41:25.414 --> 00:41:29.722
that narrow sense of keeping
people alive,

00:41:29.722 --> 00:41:33.400
there's still endemic scarcity.
 

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:38.360
This notion of superabundance
doesn't make any sense.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.510
Just think about it for a
minute.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:49.920
Money that we spend on dialysis
machines is money that we don't

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:56.159
spend on heart transplants or
AIDS research.

00:41:56.159 --> 00:42:02.074
So no matter how much wealth
there is, there are still

00:42:02.074 --> 00:42:07.320
distributive choices to make in
this society.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.389
There's still going to be the
problem that we're going to say,

00:42:10.389 --> 00:42:21.969
"Well, if we choose to
protect needs A,

00:42:21.969 --> 00:42:26.831
B and C, anyone who needs
dialysis should get free

00:42:26.831 --> 00:42:28.518
dialysis."
 

00:42:28.518 --> 00:42:32.159
Whether we make it explicit or
implicit is beside the point.

00:42:32.159 --> 00:42:35.547
Somebody who needs something
else to keep them alive is not

00:42:35.547 --> 00:42:36.599
going to get it.
 

00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:43.614
We're not going to do research
on cancer because we're spending

00:42:43.614 --> 00:42:50.969
that next marginal dollar doing
research on the causes of AIDS.

00:42:50.969 --> 00:42:55.286
So once you see that point,
then the notion of

00:42:55.286 --> 00:42:58.739
superabundance becomes
incoherent.

00:42:58.739 --> 00:43:01.070
There is no such thing as
superabundance.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:07.556
And without superabundance you
can't get a world beyond

00:43:07.556 --> 00:43:11.880
entitlements explicit or
implicit.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:15.380
You're never going to transcend
the world of scarcity.

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.722
Once you see that meeting
needs, even defined in this

00:43:19.722 --> 00:43:24.400
minimal way of what's necessary
to keep people alive,

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:28.489
involves tradeoffs,
what you're really saying is

00:43:28.489 --> 00:43:32.840
that scarcity is endemic to the
human condition.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:39.007
And this is the deepest
analytical flaw in Marx's

00:43:39.007 --> 00:43:41.449
normative theory.
 

00:43:41.449 --> 00:43:45.052
Because once you say that
scarcity is endemic to the human

00:43:45.052 --> 00:43:48.719
condition you can't get away
from distributive conflict.

00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:52.670
You've got to find some way
whether it's a system of rights,

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:55.730
whether it's the market,
whether it's the government

00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:58.190
making decisions about who needs
what,

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:03.570
somebody or some mechanism is
going to make those decisions,

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:04.300
right?
 

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:09.235
So you reach the proposition
that scarcity is endemic to the

00:44:09.235 --> 00:44:14.257
human condition and you have to
reason about what makes sense

00:44:14.257 --> 00:44:16.599
taking that for granted.
 

00:44:16.599 --> 00:44:21.842
In a way it's ironic that Marx
was so blind to this because

00:44:21.842 --> 00:44:26.635
Marx was the person who said,
"Human nature's not

00:44:26.635 --> 00:44:27.630
static.
 

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.199
It evolves through history.
 

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:34.554
We develop and change,"
and so you would think he of

00:44:34.554 --> 00:44:39.429
all people would see that the
fact that in 1886,

00:44:39.429 --> 00:44:42.980
the natural life expectancy
was, whatever it was,

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:46.208
forty-six years,
why that shouldn't be taken as

00:44:46.208 --> 00:44:48.998
a given,
or the biblical three score

00:44:48.998 --> 00:44:52.809
years and ten be taken as a
given for that matter.

00:44:52.809 --> 00:44:57.875
But you'll never reach a
condition in which scarcity can

00:44:57.875 --> 00:45:01.835
be transcended,
and that's the ultimate hope

00:45:01.835 --> 00:45:04.230
behind his utopianism.
 

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.652
So it's not that I disagree
with any of the points you folks

00:45:07.652 --> 00:45:08.059
made.
 

00:45:08.059 --> 00:45:09.389
I think they're all correct.
 

00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:12.840
There are other reasons that
you would question it,

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.429
but the reason this particular
argument,

00:45:16.429 --> 00:45:20.628
I think, cuts at the roots of
his theory is that it's the most

00:45:20.628 --> 00:45:23.931
favorable interpretation of his
account of needs,

00:45:23.931 --> 00:45:24.619
right?
 

00:45:24.619 --> 00:45:29.018
There's no more favorable
interpretation than limiting

00:45:29.018 --> 00:45:32.670
them to survival,
and even on that account we

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:36.239
can't get to a world of
superabundance.

00:45:36.239 --> 00:45:41.420
We will always live in a world
of scarcity, and that means that

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:46.351
whatever you have to say about
distribution has to take that

00:45:46.351 --> 00:45:47.690
for granted.
 

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:51.938
This is, I think,
as powerful a point as the

00:45:51.938 --> 00:45:57.570
point we made when we came to
the end of our discussion of

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.373
Mill,
to the effect that you can't

00:46:00.373 --> 00:46:03.356
get the politics out of the
definition of harm,

00:46:03.356 --> 00:46:03.940
right?
 

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.730
There's no neutral way to
define harm.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:11.724
Another way of thinking about
this is it's a way of trying to

00:46:11.724 --> 00:46:13.590
transcend politics,
right?

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:20.268
One of Engels,
not Marx, but never mind Engels

00:46:20.268 --> 00:46:27.291
was stating a Marxian view,
was that the great thing about

00:46:27.291 --> 00:46:32.177
socialism and communism is that
politics gets displaced by

00:46:32.177 --> 00:46:33.719
administration.
 

00:46:33.719 --> 00:46:37.764
That you don't have to worry
about distributive conflict in

00:46:37.764 --> 00:46:40.621
this story because there's
superabundance,

00:46:40.621 --> 00:46:41.320
right?
 

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.516
And in Mill's account you don't
have to worry about the

00:46:44.516 --> 00:46:48.128
definition of harm in his case
because there will be a neutral

00:46:48.128 --> 00:46:49.489
scientific account.
 

00:46:49.489 --> 00:46:51.010
Neither of them works.
 

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:55.496
So we have a world in which
there have to be political

00:46:55.496 --> 00:46:58.800
choices about distributive
questions.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.824
Some say leave it to the
market, but that is itself a

00:47:01.824 --> 00:47:02.929
political choice.
 

00:47:02.929 --> 00:47:06.929
We'll have more to say about
that.

00:47:06.929 --> 00:47:12.010
So the beginning of the end of
Marxism is, I think,

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:17.297
the recognition that scarcity
is endemic to the human

00:47:17.297 --> 00:47:18.719
condition.
 

00:47:18.719 --> 00:47:23.543
What we will do on Wednesday is
explore and unpack some other

00:47:23.543 --> 00:47:28.286
difficulties with his argument
and then see whether and what

00:47:28.286 --> 00:47:31.179
the remaining insights might be.
 

00:47:31.179 --> 00:47:32.469
See you then.
 

00:47:32.469 --> 00:47:38.000

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.670
Professor Amy
Hungerford: This is

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.150
"American Novel Since 1945."
Welcome. I am Amy Hungerford.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.940
Today I am going to do a couple
of things.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.303
In the first half of class,
I'm going to tell you a little

00:00:13.303 --> 00:00:16.489
bit about the class and
introduce some of the questions

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:19.852
that we will think about over
the term if you stay in this

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:22.862
course.
In the second half of class,

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:27.588
I will introduce to you and
start telling the first story of

00:00:27.588 --> 00:00:29.693
the term,
and that's about Richard

00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:32.505
Wright's Black Boy,
which is our first reading

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.600
of the term.
In between those two parts,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.625
I will ask that anyone who is
shopping the class and would

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:44.240
like to leave at that time do so
then.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.709
I would be grateful if you
would wait until that point if

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:50.816
at all you possibly can.
It just makes the whole thing

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.861
work a little easier and it
prevents that drop in the pit of

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:56.390
my stomach when I see half of
the class leave.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.189
So I will indicate when that
moment is.

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:07.725
Come on.
Make yourself comfortable on

00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:15.136
the floor if you can.
My goal in this course is

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:20.866
to allow you or to invite you to
read some of the most compelling

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:25.970
novels written in the last
little over a half century.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.810
This includes a whole range of
thematic concerns.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.045
So when I look down at my list
of novels--which I have not

00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:37.110
brought with me (I trust you can
find it on the web;

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.725
I didn't want to kill trees by
making enough of these for all

00:01:41.725 --> 00:01:46.495
of you)--when I look down at my
list of books and I think about

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:50.269
what these books are about,
I see war.

00:01:50.269 --> 00:01:54.565
I see war, all the way from the
Trojan War, to the

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:59.387
Mexican-American War in the
1840s, all the way up to the

00:01:59.387 --> 00:02:04.210
Vietnam War.
I see love, in all kinds of

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:12.319
guises: be they criminal as in
Lolita, pedophiliac love;

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.610
be they sort of ideational
romantic, John Barth;

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.512
be they campus love,
that's The Human Stain,

00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:27.746
Philip Roth;
all kinds and forms of sex and

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:33.067
love, and then there is politics
interweaving with all those

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:37.372
things.
There are questions of identity

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:40.621
and race.
There is a nervous breakdown

00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:45.231
that actually happens right here
in New Haven in one of these

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.927
novels.
That's in Franny and

00:02:47.927 --> 00:02:51.264
Zooey.
I see women who give up on

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:55.851
housekeeping altogether and let
their house go to ruin and

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.490
become vagrants.
I see suicide.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.726
I see slavery.
All these things you can read

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:06.629
about in these novels,
but reading these novels is not

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.650
just about reading about those
things.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.716
It's also going to be the
process of watching an artistic

00:03:14.716 --> 00:03:19.240
form unfold over a very exciting
period of time.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.812
In the second half of the
twentieth century and up now

00:03:22.812 --> 00:03:27.392
into the twenty-first century,
writers were thinking very hard

00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:32.004
about what to do stylistically
with all the innovations that

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:35.990
come in that powerful period
known as modernism.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.418
So one of the things we're
going to think about together in

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:42.610
the course is what happens to
all those innovations.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.480
Are they abandoned?
Are they embellished?

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.440
Are they stretched?
Are they rejected?

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.561
What happens to those resources
that the great modernist writers

00:03:54.561 --> 00:03:58.544
endowed language with so
powerfully earlier in the

00:03:58.544 --> 00:04:01.774
century?
So there are formal questions

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:04.650
that we will take up time and
again.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.288
There are questions that
intersect between the form and

00:04:08.288 --> 00:04:11.590
the content in every single
novel that we read.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.493
Now perhaps those of you who
like to read fiction,

00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:17.990
and especially who like to read
fiction from this period,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.052
will look down at that syllabus
and you'll say,

00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:24.890
"Well, where is?"
"Where is Don DeLillo?"

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.701
"Where is John Updike?"
My answer for the

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:35.051
question--"Why these writers?"--
my answer for the question is

00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:38.247
the course.
It's an answer that unfolds

00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:41.090
over these fourteen weeks of the
term.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.379
Thirteen?
Thirteen.

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.482
The short answer is that I
think these writers best

00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:52.830
represent all the different
threads, all the different

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.440
forces in the American Novel
Since 1945.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.412
There are lots of other writers
we could include,

00:04:59.412 --> 00:05:01.579
including those two that I
named,

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:05.363
that would equally illustrate
some of the threads that I've

00:05:05.363 --> 00:05:09.114
got on the syllabus now,
but these are the ones for

00:05:09.114 --> 00:05:13.619
various practical and more
substantive reasons that I have

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:15.755
chosen.
Now you do have an

00:05:15.755 --> 00:05:19.643
opportunity--this class
does--that my class has never

00:05:19.643 --> 00:05:23.272
had before,
and that is to nominate your

00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:28.899
own novel for the last one that
we read, one of your choice.

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:32.108
Now I have done this in a
sophomore seminar,

00:05:32.108 --> 00:05:34.870
and I did it in a graduate
seminar.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.394
I invited my students to
present some choices to the

00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:43.120
class, and then the class voted
on them.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.883
It was incredibly successful.
In the undergraduate course--it

00:05:46.883 --> 00:05:50.483
was a small seminar--I had
groups of students proposing two

00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:53.399
novels actually for the end of
the syllabus,

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:58.811
and the exercise gets you to
think very hard about what you

00:05:58.811 --> 00:06:04.510
think this period is all about.
It's not just about what's fun

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.480
to read, although it is that
too.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.380
It's about thinking what would
make the right ending to this

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.391
intellectual trajectory,
this intellectual narrative

00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:20.642
that we're going to move through
this term: what would make the

00:06:20.642 --> 00:06:23.191
right ending.
So it has a sort of

00:06:23.191 --> 00:06:26.512
intellectual purpose to it.
But I will tell you,

00:06:26.512 --> 00:06:29.765
the students I had in that
seminar did amazing things to

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:34.229
push their choice of novel.
One group nominated Jeffrey

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:38.390
Eugenides' Middlesex.
There was a huge art

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.149
installation that I walked into
on that day of class.

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:45.339
It covered the ceiling and the
walls and the floors.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.570
They had done original
photography for it.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.753
It was really spectacular.
There was a theatrical skit for

00:06:51.753 --> 00:06:54.319
Dave Eggers' How We Are
Hungry.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:58.810
There was campaign
literature, pamphlets and so on.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.627
So people were very creative
with it, and it was really lots

00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:05.786
of fun.
And for me it's fun because I

00:07:05.786 --> 00:07:10.050
may not know the novel that you
end up picking,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.860
and so it is a kind of
challenge for me to take a novel

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.670
that you've chosen and come to
grips with it myself.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.815
It may be one that I know.
Now let me just say in a

00:07:21.815 --> 00:07:26.089
technical way:
if you decide to volunteer to

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:30.860
nominate a novel,
you'll get no extra credit.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.297
It'll do nothing for your grade.
But you will get glory,

00:07:34.297 --> 00:07:37.740
whatever glory there is to be
had at the front of this room.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.149
Maybe that's miniscule,
but maybe it's going to be fun

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:45.009
for you, especially if you have
a sort of theatrical bent,

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:47.405
or if you like getting up in
front of people,

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:50.454
or if you're just really,
really passionate about a novel

00:07:50.454 --> 00:07:53.999
that you want everyone to read.
So that's something that we

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:57.459
will do, and I will tell you
more about at mid semester.

00:07:57.459 --> 00:07:59.638
So that's the piece of the
syllabus that I can't tell you

00:07:59.638 --> 00:08:01.848
about.
I don't know what that dream

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:05.780
we're going to dream together is
when we read that novel.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.811
I don't know what that'll be.
I want to just go over the

00:08:10.811 --> 00:08:13.569
requirements of the course that
really are required,

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:17.269
not the optional piece,
just so that you understand

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:19.860
what my purpose is
pedagogically.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.358
This course is very much open
to English majors and to non

00:08:24.358 --> 00:08:27.451
English majors.
It's essentially a reading

00:08:27.451 --> 00:08:29.677
course.
That's what I want you to take

00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:32.320
away from this:
the knowledge of these novels.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.690
I want you to read them.
I want you to think about them.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.299
I want you to talk about them.
But I don't expect you to

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:43.959
become an English major in order
to do that if you're not already

00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:46.527
one.
However, if you do happen to be

00:08:46.527 --> 00:08:50.583
an English or a literature major
or someone who's just very

00:08:50.583 --> 00:08:53.309
serious about reading at that
level,

00:08:53.309 --> 00:08:56.590
you will find plenty to chew on
here.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:01.399
Not all of the novels aspire to
or have as their purpose that

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:05.728
kind of difficulty that
sometimes English majors really

00:09:05.728 --> 00:09:08.191
want.
They want to have to work

00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.769
incredibly hard at the formal
level.

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:15.149
Some of the novels have that,
but not all of them.

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:18.190
The challenge for you is to
figure out: well,

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.539
what do we do with those
novels?

00:09:20.539 --> 00:09:25.044
What is the aim of a novel that
isn't all about formal

00:09:25.044 --> 00:09:27.450
innovation?
What are those novels doing?

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.419
Is it just inappropriate to
call them literature?

00:09:32.419 --> 00:09:34.789
Should we think about them in a
different way?

00:09:34.789 --> 00:09:39.250
How should we integrate that
kind of novel with novels that

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:43.458
have more formal ambitions?
So the paper length-- there

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:46.904
are two papers required,
and there is a final exam--the

00:09:46.904 --> 00:09:49.840
paper length is designed to be
quite large.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.870
It's two five-to-eight-page
papers.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:56.011
Now a five-page paper is very
different from an eight-page

00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:58.876
paper if you're actually
thinking about the words you

00:09:58.876 --> 00:10:02.176
choose and how you write it.
If you just sort of the night

00:10:02.176 --> 00:10:04.666
before scribble,
scribble, scribble until you're

00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:06.483
done,
maybe there's not that much

00:10:06.483 --> 00:10:09.372
difference between a five- and
an eight-page paper except

00:10:09.372 --> 00:10:11.685
editing.
But substantively,

00:10:11.685 --> 00:10:15.953
if you're using every sentence
in that paper,

00:10:15.953 --> 00:10:20.899
you can write a lot more in an
eight-page paper,

00:10:20.899 --> 00:10:24.217
if you've used every sentence
to say something substantive to

00:10:24.217 --> 00:10:27.559
move an argument along,
than you can in the five-page.

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:32.694
That's for those people who
really want to push themselves

00:10:32.694 --> 00:10:37.828
and want to advance a really
significant piece of thinking

00:10:37.828 --> 00:10:41.360
about a novel.
Now I will also say that a

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.548
five-page paper written well can
trump an eight-page paper

00:10:45.548 --> 00:10:48.340
written poorly any day of the
week.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:52.215
So you don't have to write long
papers, but what I'm saying is:

00:10:52.215 --> 00:10:55.777
the room is there for you to
stretch out if you want to do

00:10:55.777 --> 00:10:58.136
that.
The final exam:

00:10:58.136 --> 00:11:03.618
you should do well if you read,
and if you come to lecture,

00:11:03.618 --> 00:11:07.768
and if you attend section.
The process of doing those

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:10.857
three things will have allowed
you to already have thought

00:11:10.857 --> 00:11:13.750
quite a bit about these novels.
You should remember them.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.090
I think they are quite
memorable.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:19.288
They are quite distinct from
each other, and you should be

00:11:19.288 --> 00:11:23.929
able to manage with that final
exam without undue difficulty.

00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:26.529
I will say that the reading
load is heavy.

00:11:26.529 --> 00:11:28.110
I have made some adjustments
every year.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.549
I'm trying to deal with the
fact that there are so many

00:11:32.549 --> 00:11:37.483
novels I love written between,
say, 1985 and the present that

00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:41.096
are over 400 pages apiece.
So what do you do with those on

00:11:41.096 --> 00:11:43.116
a syllabus?
Well, I guess it's the problem

00:11:43.116 --> 00:11:46.059
that people who teach the
eighteenth-century novel always

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:47.402
have,
or the Victorian novel:

00:11:47.402 --> 00:11:49.087
the Victorian novel like the
triple-decker,

00:11:49.087 --> 00:11:52.720
the three-volume novel.
At least I don't have those.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.710
But what I've done is to
excerpt some of the texts

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.823
earlier in the term--and
actually there's a slightly

00:11:58.823 --> 00:12:02.424
heavier reading before break
than there used to be-- so that

00:12:02.424 --> 00:12:05.110
it's a little bit lighter after
break,

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.730
when we're doing those long
novels.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.362
Okay.
Last thing: This course,

00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:15.865
as you may have noticed from
our friends behind us,

00:12:15.865 --> 00:12:22.909
is being filmed as part of the
Yale Open Courses Initiative.

00:12:22.909 --> 00:12:26.030
It is an initiative funded by
the William and Flora Hewlett

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.746
Foundation.
This is one of eight courses

00:12:28.746 --> 00:12:32.419
being offered this year that are
being videotaped.

00:12:32.419 --> 00:12:36.367
They will be made available
free to the public via the

00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:40.686
internet, so this is a way of
allowing the world to benefit

00:12:40.686 --> 00:12:45.032
from what we all do at Yale.
That said, what we try to

00:12:45.032 --> 00:12:49.506
do--what I will try to do,
and what I hope you will try to

00:12:49.506 --> 00:12:53.778
do--is to forget about them.
It's sometimes hard for me,

00:12:53.778 --> 00:12:56.910
but I trust that you will be
able to do that.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:01.102
So forget about that.
The point is not to cater to

00:13:01.102 --> 00:13:05.735
that camera, but to do what we
do, and to show the world what

00:13:05.735 --> 00:13:09.887
it is that we do.
Now I like to ask questions in

00:13:09.887 --> 00:13:12.914
lecture.
I really am just not a fan of

00:13:12.914 --> 00:13:16.630
the sort of zone-out model of
lecture audition.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.460
So I will ask you questions.
The only annoying thing I will

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.259
have to do is to repeat your
answers.

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:27.608
So I hope you will not object
to that, because you don't have

00:13:27.608 --> 00:13:31.106
microphones on you,
and it's very cumbersome to get

00:13:31.106 --> 00:13:34.633
them back to you,
so we're not going to mike you

00:13:34.633 --> 00:13:37.410
so that your answers can be
heard.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:41.670
All right.
Any questions so far about what

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.389
I've said?
Okay.

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:46.690
Now I want to talk about
the handout.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.828
Those of you who don't have it:
there are a couple more up

00:13:51.828 --> 00:13:53.000
front here.

00:13:58.179 --> 00:14:00.460
There should be the rest of a
stack over here.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.500
Oh, no. These are my notes.
Are we out?

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.884
Yeah, there are a couple more,
and if you don't have one you

00:14:06.884 --> 00:14:07.370
can share.

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:30.650
What I have here for us to look
at together today are two little

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.712
texts.
I'm going to read parts of them

00:14:33.712 --> 00:14:37.564
to you, and together I think
they give you the sort of

00:14:37.564 --> 00:14:41.779
snapshot I want you to have of
where literature stands,

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:46.721
where reading stands,
at the middle of the twentieth

00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.932
century.
The first one is an

00:14:48.932 --> 00:14:52.723
advertisement for the Random
House edition of James Joyce's

00:14:52.723 --> 00:14:56.179
Ulysses,
 and this appeared in

00:14:56.179 --> 00:15:00.250
The Saturday Review of
Literature in 1934.

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.519
So I'm going to read just
parts, and I'm going to skip

00:15:03.519 --> 00:15:06.110
around a little bit and stop and
start:

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:09.505
How to enjoy James
Joyce's great novel,

00:15:09.505 --> 00:15:13.904
Ulysses. For
those who are already engrossed

00:15:13.904 --> 00:15:16.759
in the reading of
Ulysses,

00:15:16.759 --> 00:15:20.795
 as well as for those
who hesitate to begin it because

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:24.751
they fear that it is obscure,
the publishers offer this

00:15:24.751 --> 00:15:28.870
simple clue as to what the
critical fuss is all about.

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:33.251
Ulysses is no harder to
understand than any other great

00:15:33.251 --> 00:15:36.859
classic.
It is essentially a story and

00:15:36.859 --> 00:15:41.264
can be enjoyed as such.
Do not let the critics confuse

00:15:41.264 --> 00:15:43.599
you.
Ulysses is not difficult

00:15:43.599 --> 00:15:47.146
to read, and it richly rewards
each reader in wisdom and

00:15:47.146 --> 00:15:50.198
pleasure.
So thrilling an adventure into

00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:54.374
the soul and mind and heart of
man has never before been

00:15:54.374 --> 00:15:57.469
charted.
This is your opportunity to

00:15:57.469 --> 00:16:02.238
begin the exploration of one of
the greatest novels of our

00:16:02.238 --> 00:16:06.254
time.
What I want you to notice first

00:16:06.254 --> 00:16:11.484
of all is the kind of reader
that's being invoked here for

00:16:11.484 --> 00:16:14.879
that modernist classic
Ulysses.

00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:18.840
It is not the fussing
critic.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.791
Now if you read down,
if you sort of skim down,

00:16:22.791 --> 00:16:27.430
you'll see that kind of
language applied to critics.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:33.959
They seem fretful.
They seem interested in obscure

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:37.572
knowledge.
That's how this advertisement

00:16:37.572 --> 00:16:41.715
represents critics,
even though it also invokes

00:16:41.715 --> 00:16:46.669
critics to describe what's
powerful about the novel.

00:16:46.669 --> 00:16:50.740
So there's a sort of two-faced
representation of the critic.

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:54.158
But the important one,
I think, is that dismissal of

00:16:54.158 --> 00:16:57.543
the critic.
The point of this advertisement

00:16:57.543 --> 00:17:02.002
is to make you feel like you
don't have to know what the

00:17:02.002 --> 00:17:05.569
critic knows in order to read
this novel.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:10.880
What you need is something like
strength or bravery.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.264
Listen to that language:
"For those who are already

00:17:14.264 --> 00:17:17.107
engrossed in the reading of
Ulysses,

00:17:17.107 --> 00:17:20.559
as well as for those who
hesitate to begin it."

00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:24.309
The people already engrossed
are the strong ones,

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:28.840
and "you can be that!," this
advertisement wants to say.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:34.226
You can be the strong reader.
That hesitation--"those who

00:17:34.226 --> 00:17:38.205
hesitate to begin it"--it's a
kind of feminized,

00:17:38.205 --> 00:17:43.251
mincing approach to the novel.
It's sort of like those fussy

00:17:43.251 --> 00:17:46.446
critics.
So this advertisement tells

00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:50.876
you that the great classic of
modernism is something you

00:17:50.876 --> 00:17:55.969
stride into like a man,
but you don't have to be a

00:17:55.969 --> 00:18:00.700
particularly extraordinary man
to do so.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:04.957
"This monumental novel about 20
hours in the life of an average

00:18:04.957 --> 00:18:09.215
man can be read and appreciated
like any other great novel once

00:18:09.215 --> 00:18:12.099
its framework and form are
visualized,

00:18:12.099 --> 00:18:15.176
just as we can enjoy Hamlet
without solving all the

00:18:15.176 --> 00:18:17.930
problems which agitate the
critics and scholars."

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.670
There's that agitation that I
was talking about.

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.641
"The average man":
this advertisement wants you to

00:18:25.641 --> 00:18:30.260
see Ulysses as a story
about a man you can identify

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.853
with.
So you don't have to be a

00:18:32.853 --> 00:18:34.850
critic;
you have to be strong;

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:38.346
but you know what?
You can be the average man,

00:18:38.346 --> 00:18:42.849
because this is a story about
the average man.

00:18:42.849 --> 00:18:46.953
"With a plot furnished by
Homer, against a setting by

00:18:46.953 --> 00:18:50.910
Dante, and with characters
motivated by Shakespeare,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.598
Ulysses is really not as
difficult to comprehend as

00:18:55.598 --> 00:19:00.241
critics like to pretend."
This is like saying "dress by

00:19:00.241 --> 00:19:04.249
Prada, shoes by Ferragamo."
It's as if there are

00:19:04.249 --> 00:19:06.419
brands--Dante,
Shakespeare,

00:19:06.419 --> 00:19:11.258
Homer--that are identifiable.
They're familiar,and-- what's

00:19:11.258 --> 00:19:15.519
more--they carry with it that
sense of cultural capital.

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:17.369
So what do I mean by cultural
capital?

00:19:17.369 --> 00:19:22.897
It's that knowledge that makes
you one of the elite of your

00:19:22.897 --> 00:19:25.855
world.
It's also that knowledge that

00:19:25.855 --> 00:19:29.564
an educated, sort of
belletristic reader of The

00:19:29.564 --> 00:19:33.123
Saturday Review of Literature
would be very,

00:19:33.123 --> 00:19:37.664
very familiar with.
So in a sense it tells you this

00:19:37.664 --> 00:19:42.410
work of art is of a piece with
what you already know;

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:46.442
it's familiar in those ways,
and you shouldn't be afraid of

00:19:46.442 --> 00:19:49.395
it.
At the same time it's part and

00:19:49.395 --> 00:19:54.260
parcel of that elite body of
knowledge, so again there is

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:58.690
this kind of two-facedness to
the advertisement.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.013
It's both Everyman,
and it's the elite,

00:20:03.013 --> 00:20:09.916
who will best read this book.
Now I want to contrast that

00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:16.777
with what we see from Nabokov in
this essay, Good Readers and

00:20:16.777 --> 00:20:19.610
Good Writers.
This is from 1950.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:28.308
Now the part of the essay just
prior to this explains that he

00:20:28.308 --> 00:20:33.236
gave this little quiz that you
see to some college students

00:20:33.236 --> 00:20:38.273
when he was giving a lecture.
So this is what he asked them

00:20:38.273 --> 00:20:41.502
to do:
Select four answers to

00:20:41.502 --> 00:20:47.099
the question 'What should a
reader be to be a good reader?'

00:20:47.099 --> 00:20:50.349
"The reader should belong to a
book club."

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:55.676
"The reader should identify
himself or herself with the hero

00:20:55.676 --> 00:20:58.846
or heroine."
"The reader should concentrate

00:20:58.846 --> 00:21:00.880
on the social,
economic angle."

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:05.233
"The reader should prefer a
story with action and dialog to

00:21:05.233 --> 00:21:08.273
one with none."
"The reader should have seen

00:21:08.273 --> 00:21:11.310
the book in a movie."
"The reader should be a budding

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.400
author."
"The reader should have

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.930
imagination."
"The reader should have memory."

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.589
"The reader should have a
dictionary."

00:21:19.589 --> 00:21:24.370
"The reader should have some
artistic sense." 

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.662
And Nabokov says: 
The students leaned

00:21:27.662 --> 00:21:30.115
heavily on emotional
identification,

00:21:30.115 --> 00:21:34.109
action, and the social,
economic and historical angle.

00:21:34.109 --> 00:21:38.356
Of course, as you have guessed,
the good reader is the one who

00:21:38.356 --> 00:21:41.934
has imagination,
memory, a dictionary and some

00:21:41.934 --> 00:21:45.060
artistic sense,
which sense I propose to

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.789
develop in myself and others
whenever I have the chance.

00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:53.440
There are at least two
varieties of imagination in the

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.471
reader's case,
so let us see which of the two

00:21:56.471 --> 00:21:59.640
is the right one to use in
reading a book.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.040
First there is the
comparatively lowly kind which

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.433
turns for support to the simple
emotions and is of a definitely

00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:10.437
personal nature.
A situation in a book is

00:22:10.437 --> 00:22:13.944
intensely felt because it
reminds us of something that

00:22:13.944 --> 00:22:17.119
happened to us or to someone we
know or knew,

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:21.642
or again the reader treasures a
book mainly because it evokes a

00:22:21.642 --> 00:22:25.079
country, a landscape,
a mode of living which he

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:28.247
nostalgically recalls as part of
his own past,

00:22:28.247 --> 00:22:30.609
or,
and this is the worst thing a

00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:33.418
reader can do,
he identifies himself with a

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:37.651
character in the book.
This lowly variety is not the

00:22:37.651 --> 00:22:42.510
kind of imagination I would like
readers to use.

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.290
What a crime!
How many of you are guilty of

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.000
this kind of reading,
ever?

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.079
Okay.
Nabokov, be gone.

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:54.832
But he wants to get at
something here,

00:22:54.832 --> 00:22:59.296
and I think it's helpful to put
it next to that advertisement

00:22:59.296 --> 00:23:03.634
for Ulysses.
He wants you to think about

00:23:03.634 --> 00:23:07.373
reading on his terms.
His terms are very much

00:23:07.373 --> 00:23:11.205
informed by a modernist
sensibility of what literature

00:23:11.205 --> 00:23:15.688
is all about--and I'm going to
say more about what that is when

00:23:15.688 --> 00:23:20.170
I lecture on Lolita--but
it's very much in contrast with

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:24.000
that Ulysses ad.
"Don't identify.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.730
It's not about you.
It's about something else."

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.261
Well, what is it about?
So what is the authentic

00:23:32.261 --> 00:23:34.680
instrument to be used by the
reader?

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:42.130
It is impersonal imagination
and artistic delight.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.016
What should be established I
think is an artistic,

00:23:45.016 --> 00:23:48.549
harmonious balance between the
reader's mind and the author's

00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:51.020
mind.
We ought to remain a little

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:55.259
aloof and take pleasure in this
aloofness, while at the same

00:23:55.259 --> 00:23:59.140
time we keenly enjoy--enjoy with
tears and shivers--the

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.302
interweave of a given
masterpiece.To be quite

00:24:02.302 --> 00:24:06.470
objective in these matters is of
course impossible.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.930
Everything that is worthwhile
is to some extent subjective.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:14.921
For instance,
you sitting there may be merely

00:24:14.921 --> 00:24:18.549
my dream, and I may be your
nightmare.

00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:22.140
(Some of you might think that
after Lolita.) But

00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.495
what I mean is that the reader
must know when and where to

00:24:25.495 --> 00:24:29.871
contribute his imagination,
and this he does by trying to

00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:34.446
get clear the specific world the
author places at his

00:24:34.446 --> 00:24:39.064
disposal.
If there is a balance of power

00:24:39.064 --> 00:24:44.830
between the writer and the
reader in this little vignette,

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:50.900
the power really I think
finally resides with the writer.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:57.654
It is the writer whose world
the reader is here asked to get

00:24:57.654 --> 00:25:00.743
clear.
You are asked to use your

00:25:00.743 --> 00:25:04.829
imagination to enter a world
made by the writer,

00:25:04.829 --> 00:25:09.088
a world of imagination,
and so it's the writer who

00:25:09.088 --> 00:25:13.654
directs you in that way.
You are not asked to imagine a

00:25:13.654 --> 00:25:16.583
place you knew,
something from your history,

00:25:16.583 --> 00:25:19.650
something from your knowledge
of yourself.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:24.218
It is not about finding the
average man--which you are--also

00:25:24.218 --> 00:25:27.470
in the novel,
there staring back at you.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:31.290
It's about finding some other
dream world.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.669
Maybe it's a nightmare world.
So, for Nabokov,

00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:41.389
he wants to imagine a kind of
literary encounter that's very

00:25:41.389 --> 00:25:46.431
much separate from those other
things he talks about:

00:25:46.431 --> 00:25:48.950
other media;
the movies;

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.630
having seen the book in the
movie;

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:56.525
from the life that we all lead
when we work and when we go to

00:25:56.525 --> 00:26:00.509
school;
the social, economic angle.

00:26:00.509 --> 00:26:03.366
He wants to read it as apart
from the emotions,

00:26:03.366 --> 00:26:06.534
although he wants to enlist
those emotions in a very

00:26:06.534 --> 00:26:10.032
specific way.
Remember those "tears and

00:26:10.032 --> 00:26:13.109
shivers."
Those have to be the tears and

00:26:13.109 --> 00:26:15.890
shivers of impersonality.
That word,

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.251
"impersonality"--made famous by
T.S.

00:26:19.251 --> 00:26:23.861
Eliot who advocated
impersonality as the ultimate

00:26:23.861 --> 00:26:29.623
stance of the artist--that is
the stance from which all great

00:26:29.623 --> 00:26:34.904
art should proceed.
So Nabokov imbues that state of

00:26:34.904 --> 00:26:40.292
impersonality with certain kinds
of emotion and then asks the

00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:45.681
reader to be as impersonal as
that modernist artist also must

00:26:45.681 --> 00:26:49.044
be.
So what I think we get from

00:26:49.044 --> 00:26:54.247
these two little readings today
is a sense of where literature

00:26:54.247 --> 00:26:57.660
finds itself at a kind of
crossroads.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:01.614
What kind of reader are writers
in this period looking for,

00:27:01.614 --> 00:27:04.410
and what do they want from that
reader?

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.640
To what context do they address
themselves?

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.570
Is it a social context?
Is it a literary one?

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.890
Is it a psychological one?
Is it a philosophical one?

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:20.630
Is it a political one?
What should the novel strive to

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:25.890
do?
What can novels do in the world?

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.650
What is the role of the
imagination?

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:35.893
How does that factor into what
the reader lives in daily

00:27:35.893 --> 00:27:38.674
reality?
What is the status of

00:27:38.674 --> 00:27:42.022
identification?
Is that the primary model of

00:27:42.022 --> 00:27:44.703
readership?
Is that what makes people want

00:27:44.703 --> 00:27:47.520
to read?
Is that what should make people

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.467
want to read?
These are some of the questions

00:27:50.467 --> 00:27:54.160
that these two readings raise,
and they are questions that we

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.359
will return to over and over
throughout the term.

00:27:57.359 --> 00:27:58.690
Now, I'm going to stop
there.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.970
I've gone on longer than I
expected.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:04.433
I'm going to let shoppers
leave, and then,

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:07.497
in a very short time,
I'm going to pick up again and

00:28:07.497 --> 00:28:13.055
talk about Richard Wright.
So anyone who wants to leave

00:28:13.055 --> 00:28:16.958
now please do so.
And please sign in,

00:28:16.958 --> 00:28:19.780
by the way, guys,
before you leave.

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:26.840
The sheets are coming around.
You can sign in right there.

00:28:33.089 --> 00:28:38.411
Oh, there are sign-in sheets
there.

00:28:38.411 --> 00:28:41.944
Thanks.
Those are my notes.

00:28:41.944 --> 00:28:44.404
Yeah.
Don't take those.

00:28:44.404 --> 00:28:47.952
Right here.
Oh, the syllabus?

00:28:47.952 --> 00:28:48.651
Oh.
Oh.

00:28:48.651 --> 00:28:52.500
Let's see.
Do I have any more?

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.631
No, it's not.
Hey, KC.

00:28:54.631 --> 00:29:00.672
KC, can I borrow your handout?
Can he have it?

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:06.276
I'll give you another one.
Okay.

00:29:06.276 --> 00:29:13.422
I'm going to start even though
it's still in flux here 'cause I

00:29:13.422 --> 00:29:19.048
don't want to lose my time.
Ooh, that's bad.

00:29:19.048 --> 00:29:22.980
Whoa.
I'm stepping over you.

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:28.652
I'm so sorry. Thank you.
All right.

00:29:28.652 --> 00:29:31.289
That was dramatic,
wasn't it?

00:29:31.289 --> 00:29:33.079
Okay.
All right.

00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:34.980
Now, we've talked about the
imagination.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:42.750
Now I want you to use it.
Imagine that you are a writer.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.960
That's all you've ever wanted
to be.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.000
You're at a very happy time in
your life.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.560
You just wrote a really
successful novel.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.632
Everyone loved it.
It was unlike anything that had

00:29:57.632 --> 00:30:02.259
been written before.
It was very well received.

00:30:02.259 --> 00:30:05.425
You decided,
"for my next project I am going

00:30:05.425 --> 00:30:09.055
to write about my life."
You've had a hard life,

00:30:09.055 --> 00:30:12.559
by the way.
You've had a hard life.

00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:16.190
That hard life,
you think, is really what made

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.362
you into the writer you are.
It's what allowed you to speak

00:30:20.362 --> 00:30:23.926
so powerfully to people in your
first novel, and you've always

00:30:23.926 --> 00:30:26.030
wanted to write an
autobiography.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:29.523
So that's what you do;
that's what you take up as your

00:30:29.523 --> 00:30:32.146
next project.
So you write the story of your

00:30:32.146 --> 00:30:36.200
life.
It's nearly 400 pages long.

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.150
It gets a really nice reception
at a very good publisher.

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.780
It's in page proofs.
Everything's going great.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.338
You're thrilled.
And then someone says to you,

00:30:47.338 --> 00:30:51.359
"You knowâ€¦."
Imagine this is Oprah.

00:30:51.359 --> 00:30:54.660
Oprah gets page proofs of your
novel.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.988
She's thinking about putting it
on her book club,

00:30:57.988 --> 00:31:01.455
and--if any of you know
anything about contemporary

00:31:01.455 --> 00:31:05.615
literature--getting on Oprah's
Book Club makes your sales for

00:31:05.615 --> 00:31:08.250
the next 20 years.
It's huge.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:13.308
There is no more powerful
marketing force in contemporary

00:31:13.308 --> 00:31:18.553
fiction than Oprah's Book Club.
It even does wonders for

00:31:18.553 --> 00:31:23.742
Tolstoy when Tolstoy gets on
Oprah's Book Club (not by a

00:31:23.742 --> 00:31:27.400
séance).
So you get on Oprah's Book Club.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:29.530
Oprah asks for the proofs for
your novel.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:32.807
She takes them.
She says, "This is great,

00:31:32.807 --> 00:31:36.070
but you know what?
I think--that last hundred

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.490
pages--you should get rid of
it."

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.994
And you think about it,
and you say yes,

00:31:42.994 --> 00:31:47.837
and it comes out in that form.
And there you are,

00:31:47.837 --> 00:31:51.532
and, for the next 40 years,
no one ever sees the novel that

00:31:51.532 --> 00:31:55.420
you wrote, or the autobiography
that you wrote originally.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:00.359
It's still only two thirds of
what you ever wrote it to be.

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:02.529
Well, this is what happened
to Richard Wright.

00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:06.436
This is pretty much exactly
what happened to Richard Wright

00:32:06.436 --> 00:32:10.006
in 1944.
So he had published Native

00:32:10.006 --> 00:32:15.001
Son in 1940 to great
acclaim, a very successful

00:32:15.001 --> 00:32:18.982
novel.
In 1944, he completed Black

00:32:18.982 --> 00:32:25.558
Boy, then called American
Hunger, and he had placed it

00:32:25.558 --> 00:32:31.619
with Harper and Brothers
Publishing Company in New York,

00:32:31.619 --> 00:32:35.390
and they were very happy with
it.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:39.142
It had a first part called
"Southern Night" and a second

00:32:39.142 --> 00:32:41.940
part called "The Horror and the
Glory."

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:45.926
"Southern Night" was about his
experience growing up in

00:32:45.926 --> 00:32:49.775
Mississippi.
So he was born in 1908 in

00:32:49.775 --> 00:32:54.730
Mississippi, and in 1927--I
think it's '27;

00:32:54.730 --> 00:33:01.311
let me get my date right--in
1927 he moved to Chicago,

00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:06.369
moved north.
And in the 1940s he moved to

00:33:06.369 --> 00:33:10.400
Paris, and he died there in
1960.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:17.429
So his was a progression out of
a very poor, Southern childhood,

00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:22.450
from a black family led by a
single mother,

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:27.260
to the circles in which
Gertrude Stein moved in Paris.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.342
So this is a long trajectory.
Well, Black Boy,

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:32.323
or American
Hunger, as it was

00:33:32.323 --> 00:33:34.461
then called,
covered the part in

00:33:34.461 --> 00:33:38.386
Mississippi, and then the
beginnings of his life in

00:33:38.386 --> 00:33:41.400
Chicago.
Now the part about his life in

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:45.702
Chicago was the part that was
finally cut from the novel--I'm

00:33:45.702 --> 00:33:49.601
going to keep doing this,
call it the novel versus the

00:33:49.601 --> 00:33:52.371
autobiography,
and I'll explain why I make

00:33:52.371 --> 00:33:56.829
that mistake a little later--it
was cut from the autobiography.

00:33:56.829 --> 00:34:00.776
Now he had this in page proofs
with Harper and Brothers,

00:34:00.776 --> 00:34:04.938
and Harper and Brothers sent
the page proofs out to various

00:34:04.938 --> 00:34:09.531
writers for blurbs and also sent
it to the Book of the Month Club

00:34:09.531 --> 00:34:13.475
Editorial Board.
The Book of the Month Club was

00:34:13.475 --> 00:34:16.865
a mail-order book club that
started in 1926,

00:34:16.865 --> 00:34:21.122
and it became an incredibly
powerful engine for selling

00:34:21.122 --> 00:34:24.541
books,
just as Oprah's Book Club is

00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:27.980
today.
In 1926, it had about 4700

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.043
members.
Just three years later it had

00:34:32.043 --> 00:34:36.949
110,000 members:
110,000 subscribers in 1929.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:41.900
By the '40s and '50s,
it was incredibly powerful.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.356
So what we have is this
marketing juggernaut getting

00:34:47.356 --> 00:34:51.530
interested in Wright's
autobiography.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.473
So they take it up,
and the board decides that they

00:34:54.473 --> 00:34:56.710
only like the "Southern Night"
part.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:00.633
They don't want any of the part
of the story of his life in

00:35:00.633 --> 00:35:03.880
Chicago, and that's what he
finally agrees to.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:09.070
So in the summer of 1944 he
embarks on this correspondence

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.900
with a woman named Dorothy
Canfield Fisher,

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.129
who was one of the editorial
board of the Book of the Month

00:35:16.129 --> 00:35:19.693
Club, and they go back and forth
trying to figure out how he will

00:35:19.693 --> 00:35:22.979
revise the ending to "Southern
Night" so that it sounds like

00:35:22.979 --> 00:35:26.376
the end of a book rather than
the end of a section of a longer

00:35:26.376 --> 00:35:30.438
book.
Now for Wednesday I am going to

00:35:30.438 --> 00:35:36.360
ask you to go online to the
Beinecke Digital Archive and

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.389
read those letters.
We hold them here.

00:35:40.389 --> 00:35:42.497
They are not published
anywhere, so this is kind of

00:35:42.497 --> 00:35:44.204
fun.
This is one of the special

00:35:44.204 --> 00:35:46.660
things about being at Yale.
We have those letters.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:50.820
You can go and touch them.
You can read them online,

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.929
and I want you to read those in
addition to reading the sections

00:35:54.929 --> 00:35:59.228
that I have indicated.
You can see what happens when

00:35:59.228 --> 00:36:05.210
Wright starts coming up against
these demands on his manuscript,

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.971
and I will project them during
class too so that we can talk

00:36:08.971 --> 00:36:09.800
about them.

00:36:13.269 --> 00:36:17.327
Wright's manuscript was
therefore very much under

00:36:17.327 --> 00:36:21.469
pressure as a literary
object--and it really was a

00:36:21.469 --> 00:36:24.948
literary object.
I think we can make the

00:36:24.948 --> 00:36:27.398
mistake, thinking about
autobiography,

00:36:27.398 --> 00:36:31.959
that it's somehow not literary.
But in fact it's very literary,

00:36:31.959 --> 00:36:35.981
and part of what makes it
literary is the fact that you

00:36:35.981 --> 00:36:39.929
have to choose what scenes go
into that narrative.

00:36:39.929 --> 00:36:42.269
You can't just write every
single thing that happened in

00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:43.630
your life.
You have to choose.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:48.663
Well, critics took it fairly
straightforwardly as the account

00:36:48.663 --> 00:36:52.708
of a life and in that sense,
taking it that way,

00:36:52.708 --> 00:36:57.372
some of them were a little
disappointed with what they held

00:36:57.372 --> 00:36:59.821
in their hands.
For one thing,

00:36:59.821 --> 00:37:02.539
it seemed exaggerated to some
people.

00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:05.358
So the first scene,
as we will discover in Black

00:37:05.358 --> 00:37:09.049
Boy, is when Richard,
young Richard--I think he was

00:37:09.049 --> 00:37:13.613
6--burns down the family house
playing with matches underneath

00:37:13.613 --> 00:37:17.041
the curtains,
and his mother finds him where

00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:21.654
he has hidden under the burning
house and flogs him until he is

00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:24.615
unconscious,
and he's sick for a good,

00:37:24.615 --> 00:37:26.586
long time after that.
Okay.

00:37:26.586 --> 00:37:29.010
Critics were like "I don't
think so.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:33.530
That doesn't seem right."
A mother flog her son until

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:37.639
he's unconscious didn't seem too
credible.

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:41.730
As time went on there were
other kinds of complaints,

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.188
these about accuracy.
So, for instance,

00:37:45.188 --> 00:37:50.909
his mother in the book is
represented as being uneducated.

00:37:50.909 --> 00:37:52.750
Well, in fact she was a
schoolteacher.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:57.115
Now there is a difference
between scholars on how long she

00:37:57.115 --> 00:38:00.347
was a schoolteacher.
Some say she was a sort of

00:38:00.347 --> 00:38:02.489
long-term successful
schoolteacher.

00:38:02.489 --> 00:38:04.472
Others said,
"Well, she only taught school

00:38:04.472 --> 00:38:07.617
for a couple of months."
So this was not--didn't seem to

00:38:07.617 --> 00:38:10.495
be--accurate.
Then there was another

00:38:10.495 --> 00:38:13.690
scene in the autobiography,
where Richard,

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:17.820
who is the valedictorian of his
high school class,

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:22.978
writes his valedictory speech,
gives it as required to the

00:38:22.978 --> 00:38:27.763
principal beforehand,
the principal demands certain

00:38:27.763 --> 00:38:31.400
kinds of changes,
and Richard refuses.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.726
Well, apparently Richard in
real life did not refuse to make

00:38:35.726 --> 00:38:37.867
those changes.
And imagine,

00:38:37.867 --> 00:38:42.626
in a book that then undergoes
this publishing history that I

00:38:42.626 --> 00:38:45.932
have described,
this is kind of a symbolic

00:38:45.932 --> 00:38:49.094
scene.
This is a scene of whether you

00:38:49.094 --> 00:38:53.643
as a writer compromise yourself
in the face of authority that

00:38:53.643 --> 00:38:57.394
resists what you want to say.
So in the book it's a very

00:38:57.394 --> 00:39:00.215
important scene.
It's the moment when Richard

00:39:00.215 --> 00:39:03.775
really finds his voice and it
gives him the strength

00:39:03.775 --> 00:39:10.887
eventually to leave the South.
But in real life apparently he

00:39:10.887 --> 00:39:14.489
did cave.
Then there came to be

00:39:14.489 --> 00:39:19.210
questions about whether the
scenes, the stories in the book,

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:23.574
actually did happen to him.
So there is this story about

00:39:23.574 --> 00:39:27.853
his Uncle Hoskins who takes his
horse and cart with Richard in

00:39:27.853 --> 00:39:32.203
the back and drives it into the
middle of the Mississippi River

00:39:32.203 --> 00:39:35.289
as a kind of practical joke on
Richard.

00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:37.761
Well, apparently this is not
something that happened to

00:39:37.761 --> 00:39:39.621
Richard Wright.
This is something that happened

00:39:39.621 --> 00:39:40.250
to Ralph Ellison.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:48.960
Where these stories come from
began to be a problem.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:53.329
So what is autobiography?
What is this genre that Wright

00:39:53.329 --> 00:39:56.380
is working with?
It raised these kinds of

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.691
questions on the one hand.
But then there was another kind

00:40:00.691 --> 00:40:05.239
of question, and that was coming
from the other side.

00:40:05.239 --> 00:40:10.987
This is what William Faulkner
wrote to Wright upon reading

00:40:10.987 --> 00:40:14.630
Black Boy.
He said: 

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.789
The good,
lasting stuff comes out of

00:40:17.789 --> 00:40:21.719
one's individual imagination,
and sensitivity to,

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:26.306
and comprehension of,
the sufferings of Everyman--Any

00:40:26.306 --> 00:40:30.539
Man--not out of the memory of
one's own grief.

00:40:30.539 --> 00:40:34.981
I hope you will keep on saying
it, but I hope you will say it

00:40:34.981 --> 00:40:37.423
as an artist,
as in Native Son.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:41.820
So Faulkner's objection is on
the other side.

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:45.602
It's not fictional enough.
To write about your life and to

00:40:45.602 --> 00:40:48.617
pretend that you're
communicating the memory of what

00:40:48.617 --> 00:40:52.527
happened to you--your grief,
your private grief--doesn't

00:40:52.527 --> 00:40:55.990
contain that universalizing move
that fiction,

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:58.530
by its very essence,
contains.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:01.630
And you see that (you can
remember back to that conception

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.024
of literature we see in the
advertisement for

00:41:04.024 --> 00:41:06.199
Ulysses) it's about
everyman,

00:41:06.199 --> 00:41:11.251
that greatness in literature
comes from its ability to speak

00:41:11.251 --> 00:41:15.733
to some archetypal Everyman,
Any Man, and Faulkner

00:41:15.733 --> 00:41:21.019
capitalizes those words in his
letter as if they really are

00:41:21.019 --> 00:41:23.909
types.
Well, Wright himself

00:41:23.909 --> 00:41:28.565
described that difficulty of
writing his autobiography,

00:41:28.565 --> 00:41:31.670
and these are the terms he
used:

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:35.133
I found that to tell the
truth is the hardest thing on

00:41:35.133 --> 00:41:38.832
earth, harder than fighting in a
war, harder than taking part in

00:41:38.832 --> 00:41:40.712
a revolution.
If you try it,

00:41:40.712 --> 00:41:44.179
you will find that at times
sweat will break upon you.

00:41:44.179 --> 00:41:46.566
You will find that,
even if you succeed in

00:41:46.566 --> 00:41:50.000
discounting the attitudes of
others to you and your life,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.630
you must wrestle with yourself
most of all, fight with

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:57.603
yourself, for there will surge
up in you a strong desire to

00:41:57.603 --> 00:42:00.639
alter facts,
to dress up your feelings.

00:42:00.639 --> 00:42:04.642
You'll find that there are many
things you don't want to admit

00:42:04.642 --> 00:42:08.756
about yourself and others.
As your record shapes itself an

00:42:08.756 --> 00:42:12.207
awed wonder haunts you,
and yet there is no more

00:42:12.207 --> 00:42:16.760
exciting an adventure than
trying to be honest in this way.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:21.669
The clean, strong feeling that
sweeps you when you've done it

00:42:21.669 --> 00:42:27.204
makes you know that.
And even though in that little

00:42:27.204 --> 00:42:33.369
passage he suggests that it's a
struggle to be truthful,

00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:37.354
a struggle to be accurate,
a struggle not to dress up your

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:40.360
feelings with some sort of
embellishment,

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.948
he at other times says that,
well, some of the stories did

00:42:45.948 --> 00:42:50.715
come from other people,
some of the stories he included

00:42:50.715 --> 00:42:54.972
did come from other people's
experiences, not from his own

00:42:54.972 --> 00:42:57.955
life,
and that this is allowed and

00:42:57.955 --> 00:43:03.322
allowable because what he aimed
to do was produce a generic life

00:43:03.322 --> 00:43:06.559
of a black boy living in the
South.

00:43:06.559 --> 00:43:10.692
And from the titles we know he
considered for this book,

00:43:10.692 --> 00:43:15.200
none of them make that claim
"The Life of Richard Wright."

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.896
None of them say that.
It's always Black

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:23.477
Boy, American Hunger.
These are not person-

00:43:23.477 --> 00:43:26.558
specific.
These implicitly make a claim

00:43:26.558 --> 00:43:29.895
to the generality--at the
national scale,

00:43:29.895 --> 00:43:35.150
or in the racial sense--the
representativeness of this life.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:39.695
And, indeed,
what more powerful testimony to

00:43:39.695 --> 00:43:44.941
the power of narration is there,
the power of a story,

00:43:44.941 --> 00:43:49.738
to say that you heard a story
and it became as if part of your

00:43:49.738 --> 00:43:53.420
experience,
that you heard Ralph Ellison

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.567
tell that story,
and somehow you began to live

00:43:57.567 --> 00:44:00.829
it yourself?
So what we see in the

00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:04.813
publishing history of Black
Boy and also in its

00:44:04.813 --> 00:44:08.798
reception brings us back to
those questions that I was

00:44:08.798 --> 00:44:11.730
raising at the beginning of
class.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.860
What is the relationship
between writing and the world?

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:18.070
What's the relationship between
the writer and the reader?

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:22.618
What's the relationship between
fiction and what we all

00:44:22.618 --> 00:44:27.401
experience as the real world?
Our course over the term will

00:44:27.401 --> 00:44:30.844
come back to this question over
and over again,

00:44:30.844 --> 00:44:34.737
and it will also come back to
the generic question of

00:44:34.737 --> 00:44:38.705
autobiography.
Even so experimental a book as

00:44:38.705 --> 00:44:43.710
John Barth's Lost in the
Funhouse is totally absorbed

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:49.139
in the problem of what it would
mean to write about yourself.

00:44:49.139 --> 00:44:53.295
It's a persistent problem
partly because it always raises

00:44:53.295 --> 00:44:56.858
these issues of fictionality
versus truthfulness,

00:44:56.858 --> 00:44:59.530
of honesty versus
embellishment.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:03.139
It also raises the question
of how a self is made.

00:45:03.139 --> 00:45:06.985
If we look forward to the end
of the term when we read The

00:45:06.985 --> 00:45:09.550
Human Stain, which is about
a man,

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:13.334
Coleman Silk,
who tries to and succeeds in

00:45:13.334 --> 00:45:17.002
passing as Jewish.
He's a black man,

00:45:17.002 --> 00:45:21.505
and he passes for his whole
life as Jewish,

00:45:21.505 --> 00:45:25.579
and in doing so rejects his
family.

00:45:25.579 --> 00:45:30.067
In a way, what Coleman does is
write his autobiography,

00:45:30.067 --> 00:45:34.638
a fictional autobiography,
in the very process of living

00:45:34.638 --> 00:45:38.502
it.
So Roth imagines lived life as

00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:43.645
fictional in the same register
as a novel, or as

00:45:43.645 --> 00:45:49.395
truthful--dubiously so,
perhaps--in the same register

00:45:49.395 --> 00:45:53.191
as an autobiography.
So these are questions that

00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:56.484
will come back to us.
This is part of what I find so

00:45:56.484 --> 00:46:00.121
compelling about fiction and
literature in general in this

00:46:00.121 --> 00:46:02.289
period.
And this is why I study it;

00:46:02.289 --> 00:46:07.231
this is why I teach it:
because that interface--between

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:12.555
the imagination and the world,
between literary art and trying

00:46:12.555 --> 00:46:16.418
to tell the truth about
something, between form and

00:46:16.418 --> 00:46:19.199
content--those contacts are
very,

00:46:19.199 --> 00:46:23.047
very close, and they're very
compelling, I think,

00:46:23.047 --> 00:46:27.857
in part, because other media
are so powerfully on the rise in

00:46:27.857 --> 00:46:31.042
this period.
Literature has to figure

00:46:31.042 --> 00:46:34.936
out where to stake its claim.
What can literature say that

00:46:34.936 --> 00:46:38.271
nothing else can?
How can it address us in a way

00:46:38.271 --> 00:46:41.840
that is compelling in a way that
nothing else is?

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:46.230
Can we make those kinds of
claims for literature?

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:50.669
The writers on the syllabus
consistently try to imagine a

00:46:50.669 --> 00:46:54.154
way to make those claims,
make those claims for the

00:46:54.154 --> 00:46:56.519
primacy and the importance of
what they do.

00:46:56.519 --> 00:47:00.198
And I think that--in addition
to being able simply to

00:47:00.198 --> 00:47:03.239
understand the literature of
your moment,

00:47:03.239 --> 00:47:07.176
to understand the literary
world in which writers,

00:47:07.176 --> 00:47:10.389
probably among you sitting
right here,

00:47:10.389 --> 00:47:14.676
that world in which you will
bring forth your next novel,

00:47:14.676 --> 00:47:19.269
what that world looks like--you
can understand that world,

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:23.282
but also you can understand how
art confronts the world in a

00:47:23.282 --> 00:47:26.654
much more general sense.
That's what's exciting,

00:47:26.654 --> 00:47:30.632
and that's what I invite you to
think about with me in the

00:47:30.632 --> 00:47:32.355
course.
So I'll stop there,

00:47:32.355 --> 00:47:35.000
and hopefully I'll see some of
you on Wednesday.

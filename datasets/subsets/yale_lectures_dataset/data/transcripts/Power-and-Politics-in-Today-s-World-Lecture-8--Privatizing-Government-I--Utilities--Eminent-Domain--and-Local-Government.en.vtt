00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.713
- Okay, let's get to work.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.090
- We want to turn now to
the issue of eminent domain,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.180
which is being debated
right here in New Hampshire.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.010
And Josh McElveen is
the political director

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.710
and the anchor of WMURTV.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.543
Josh?

00:00:20.543 --> 00:00:21.520
- Thank you, David.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.000
And good evening, candidates.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.397
Mr. Trump, you have said, quote,

00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:25.901
"I love eminent domain",

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.640
which is the seizure of private property

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.850
for the sake of the greater
good, theoretically.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.160
You've tried to use the
measure in business endeavors.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.500
You've said you support its use

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.560
for the Keystone Pipeline Project.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.393
Here in New Hampshire,

00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:40.770
a project known as the Northern Pass

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.720
would bring hydroelectric
power from Canada

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.041
into the northeastern grid.

00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:47.250
Do you see eminent domain
as an appropriate tool

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.640
to get that project done?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.290
- Well, let me just tell
you about eminent domain

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.240
because almost all of these people,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.310
actually, Chris hasn't.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.320
But so many people have hit me

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.630
with commercials and other
things about eminent domain.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.000
Eminent domain is an absolute
necessity for a country.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.200
For our country.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.070
Without it, you wouldn't have roads,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.070
you wouldn't have hospitals,
you wouldn't have anything.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.720
You wouldn't have schools,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.810
you wouldn't have bridges.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.410
You need eminent domain.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.240
And a lot of the big Conservatives

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.720
that tell me how Conservative they are,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.680
think I'm more than they are,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.250
they tell me, oh, well they
want the Keystone Pipeline.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.670
The Keystone Pipeline
without eminent domain

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.450
wouldn't go 10 feet, okay?

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.260
You need eminent domain.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.580
And eminent domain is a
good thing, not a bad thing.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.920
And what a lot of people don't know,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.940
because they were all saying,

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.690
oh, you're gonna take their property,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.560
when somebody, when eminent domain is used

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.840
on somebody's property,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.560
that person gets a fortune.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560
They get at least fair market value,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.393
and if they're smart,

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:44.340
they'll get two or three times
the value of their property.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.840
But without eminent domain,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.440
you don't have roads, highways,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.450
schools, bridges, or anything.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.660
So, eminent domain,
it's not that I love it.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.260
But eminent domain is absolutely,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.060
it's a necessity for a country.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.870
And certainly, it's a
necessity for our country.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.620
- The difference between eminent domain

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.030
for public purpose, as Donald said,

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.720
roads and infrastructure,
pipelines and all that,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.030
that's for public purpose.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.000
But what Donald Trump did

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.990
was use eminent domain to try to take

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.280
the property of an elderly woman

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.290
on the strip in Atlantic City.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.130
That is not public purpose.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.990
That is downright wrong.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.440
And here's the problem with that.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.850
To turn this into a limousine
parking lot for his casinos

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.280
is not about public use.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.120
And in Florida, based on what we did,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.310
we made that impossible.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.480
It is part of our Constitution.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.540
That's the better approach.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.240
That is the Conservative approach.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.330
- So, eminent domain will be a big part

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.935
of our discussion today.

00:02:43.935 --> 00:02:46.140
This class and Thursday,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.870
we're gonna be concerned
with privatization

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.460
at home and abroad.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.540
Today we're gonna focus
on what is privatization,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.260
first of all.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.380
Then we're gonna revisit neoliberalism

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.450
and the Washington Consensus,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.080
both of which feature privatization

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.173
centrally in their recommendations.

00:03:08.196 --> 00:03:10.850
And that'll be some
conceptual table setting

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.280
for what's coming later.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.870
Then we will talk in some detail

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.029
about the politics, law and economics

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:21.173
of eminent domain,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.720
followed by privatization in the realm

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.940
of utilities and local government,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.890
with some links that might not be

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.873
immediately apparent to you yet,

00:03:33.908 --> 00:03:37.240
to last Thursday's
lecture on Proposition 13

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.990
and the anti-tax movement.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.530
And then on Thursday,

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.320
we will deal with the trend towards

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.010
private sector prisons and
privatization of the military,

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.383
both of which have been,

00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:56.020
both of which have been led by the US,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.490
but they're going on in many
other parts of the world.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.490
So, that's our agenda for
the next couple of sessions.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.470
Privatization means a
lot of different things.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.390
And I want to just start out

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.240
by distinguishing some of them

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.740
with a kind of conceptual
map of privatization.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.520
So when we think back to the
early lectures of this course,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.360
we talked about the
post-communist privatizations.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.340
This was the era after 1989

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.070
of creating market systems de novo,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.820
which meant creating
private property rights,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.750
the enforcement of private contracts,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.420
systems of adjudication, and so on.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.230
And as we, this is just reviewing

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.720
what was involved in those debates

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.660
about creating a private economy.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.240
The basic disagreement

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.300
in privatizing things like oil, mining,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.030
heavy industries, retail, services,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.930
basic property rights,

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.380
the basic disagreement was between

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.090
the shock therapists, on the one hand,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.740
and the gradualists on the other.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.430
And we worked through those debates

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.030
when we talked about China, Vietnam,

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.500
and modernization theory and all of that.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.360
And particularly, the
rather simplistic view that

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.890
if you democratize a country before

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.490
you had completed the
transformation of the economy,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.490
the transformation would never occur.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.640
And so, it was important to really

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.650
to do the economy first

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.710
and do the democracy later.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.910
And we saw that the
upshot of those debates,

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.370
20 years later, they washed
out in Eastern Europe,

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.570
so that countries like Czechoslovakia,

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.740
which had been gradual in
their economic transformation,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.800
certainly didn't seem to
be performing any worse

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.300
than countries like Poland

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.100
that had gone for shock therapy.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.130
And indeed, by some measures,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:09.700
including poverty and inequality,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.123
you might say the Czech
economy is more appealing.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.920
But then with a focus
on China and Vietnam,

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.773
the question might be also that
if you wait to democratize,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.600
it might be waiting for Godot.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.680
It might never actually arise.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.550
So now we're gonna be focusing

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.070
on different privatizations.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.070
This is what sometimes gets
called neoliberal privatization.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.600
And that too includes a lot
of quite disparate things.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.600
So, one is privatization as
in the Thatcher and Reagan

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.020
and as we saw even in the Blair

00:06:56.552 --> 00:06:58.131
and Clinton eras

00:06:58.131 --> 00:07:02.140
of previously public sector
or nationalized industries.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.980
Things like transportation, British rail,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.300
which was nationalized in 1948,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.270
was denationalized in 1984.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.960
It was re-privatized.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.850
Many countries have
privatized their mail systems

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.610
in whole or in part.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.069
And then what we're
gonna talk about today,

00:07:23.069 --> 00:07:25.850
privatization of utilities,

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.770
privatization of many
of the instrumentalities

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.533
of local government.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.280
But there have been other
kinds of privatizations.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.820
Much more central to the traditional

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.540
functions of government.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.360
So, under the heading that I'm gonna call

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.620
privatization of public authority,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.530
we've had things like much more use

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:52.530
of private arbitration

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.510
in solving government disputes.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.660
We're gonna talk about eminent domain.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.340
The use of eminent domain,

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.850
as Donald Trump was being
accused of in that video

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.080
to facilitate

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.900
the private transactions of individuals

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.193
or individual corporations.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.590
Another form that I'm
not gonna spend time on

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.230
but just want to put on the list there

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.480
is the increasing role of lobbyists

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.990
in actually writing legislation.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.950
More and more legislation in Washington

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.650
is not written by staffers.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.600
It's actually written by lobbyists.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.270
So, the private sector's
getting more centrally involved

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.880
in the wielding of public authority

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.850
through the legislature.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.040
And then we might say,

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.450
even further into the
traditional conception

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.040
of government than that,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.240
the privatization of core state functions.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.680
And here, we think of things like

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.550
policing, prisons, and the military.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:58.350
And those are gonna be
our topic on Thursday.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.160
So as I said, this is a
word with many meanings.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.680
And that's fine.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.440
They bear a family
resemblance to one another,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.360
but they are all different.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.163
And it's important to keep
those differences distinct.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.390
So, let's revisit the larger

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.930
political and ideological framework

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.800
within which these debates
have been going on.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.550
And I talked earlier about

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.750
what was what I called
neoliberalism at home

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.110
and the Washington Consensus abroad.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.270
Pretty much the same basket of policies.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.730
But let me ask a question.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.580
When I say the word neoliberalism,

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:45.910
how many people had
never heard of it before

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.333
you had entered this classroom?

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.660
Okay, so most people
have heard of it, okay.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.160
Those who had heard it,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.653
how many think it's a pejorative term?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.083
Pejorative term.

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:02.373
Not pejorative term.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:07.531
Not pejorative, not sure.

00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:08.410
(laughing)
Okay.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.180
So the not sure's have it.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.490
Okay, what about Washington Consensus?

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:14.723
Pejorative term?

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.210
Fewer think it's pejorative
than the neoliberalism.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:21.573
Not pejorative?

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.567
Not sure?

00:10:24.567 --> 00:10:25.713
(laughing)
Okay.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.481
So that's helpful.

00:10:28.481 --> 00:10:31.000
(laughing)

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.610
And I think what we saw in the room

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.620
is reflective of general opinion.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.070
I think that more people tend to think

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.070
of neoliberalism as a pejorative term

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:44.730
than the Washington Consensus
as a pejorative term.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.140
Though it's interesting,

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.580
and it might be a reflection of our own

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.890
sort of naval gazing myopia,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.840
that they're pretty
much the same policies.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.940
It's just when you call it
the Washington Consensus,

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.320
you're saying other people should

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.000
abide by these policies.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.460
When you say neoliberalism,

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:05.343
you're saying we should be
abiding by these policies.

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:11.930
They come with a certain
amount of freight.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.140
They are descriptive,

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.203
but they are normatively loaded.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:21.620
And the three components
that I've mentioned

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.220
several times to you,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.780
one is the idea of getting
rid of regulations,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:29.800
cutting back on government
regulation of the economy,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.220
the second is privatization,

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.920
that we're talking about today,

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.500
and the third is free trade.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.770
And these were the main components

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.510
of the neoliberal agendas of the Reagans

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.840
and the Thatchers and the
Blairs and the Clintons.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.310
And they were also the main components

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.723
of what came to be called
the Washington Consensus.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:57.160
And they were part of my message here,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.290
is that they were hegemonic until

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:02.200
the financial crisis.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.100
After which, they began to fray.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.510
And we have mostly been
in this class so far

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.260
talking about the run up
to the financial crisis,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.420
when neoliberalism at home

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.660
and the Washington Consensus abroad

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.763
did enjoy virtual hegemony.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.020
We'll see as the course goes on,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.740
that they fray, that the component pieces

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.230
actually fray at different rates.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.040
That after the financial crisis,

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.260
the first on the chopping
block, so to speak,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:40.260
was deregulation and we got
significantly new legislation

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:43.900
to regulate the economy,
the Dodd Frank bill.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.920
He has similar legislation in the UK

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.120
and in many other countries.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.350
So there was a certain,

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.320
there was a backlash against
the deregulatory agenda

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.320
of the early post Cold War period.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.800
Right after the financial crisis.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.480
Privatization has always been messier

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.773
and more contentious as we will see today.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:11.800
But the backlash against privatization,

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.070
and we're gonna see some
of it setting in actually

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.773
even before the financial crisis,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:21.190
in the rest of today's discussion.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:25.647
But free trade doesn't really
get its comeuppance until 2016

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.440
when you get the resurgence of protection.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.401
Frankly, avowedly protectionist economics.

00:13:34.401 --> 00:13:38.010
There are many countries which
say they're for free trade

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.100
and surreptitiously have protections,

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.950
but the idea that governments

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:46.000
should really protect their
own infant industries,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.750
at least, and perhaps more,

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:52.830
gains real currency much later.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:56.670
So those are some of the upcoming topics.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.250
But let's start by observing

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.150
what's been implicit in
what I've just been saying.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.720
That even when an ideology is hegemonic,

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.483
such as neoliberalism or
the Washington Consensus,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.840
hegemony is never complete.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.140
The most subtle philosophical reflection

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.310
on this subject is Michael
Walzer's Tanner lectures,

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.390
which he gave at Harvard in 1984,

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:28.760
and appeared as this
excellent little book,

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.830
Interpretation and Social Criticism,

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:35.760
published by Harvard University
Press three years later,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.780
in which he makes the case

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:42.780
that however hegemonic a
system of ideas seems to be,

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.230
there are always internal
resources within it

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.380
that enable criticism of
it and the possibility

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.930
of changing it into something different.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.770
His phrase is imminent criticism.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.730
And there was always gonna be room

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:04.730
for imminent criticism of
the Washington Consensus.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.290
So, another thing to say is that,

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.870
and this is, I think,
reflected in different

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:15.070
reactions to the ideological valence

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.870
of neoliberalism and the
Washington Consensus,

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.150
when I said we tend to think

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.310
of the Washington Consensus as

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.000
what other people should do.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.040
And of course,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.890
we don't know how those other people

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.750
necessarily think of it.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.003
So let's get a bit of
a grip on some of that.

00:15:35.208 --> 00:15:36.370
(horns beeping)

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:38.030
- [Narrator] When Bolivia
sought to refinance

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.000
the public water service
of its third largest city,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.653
the World Bank required
that it be privatized.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.480
Which is how the Bechtel
Corporation of San Francisco

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.963
gained control over all
of Cochabamba's water.

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.877
Even that which fell from the sky.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.947
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:40.442 --> 00:16:42.609
(yelling)

00:16:47.817 --> 00:16:51.734
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:56.979 --> 00:17:00.060
(chanting)

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.720
The press this beleaguered country paid

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.160
for World Bank loans

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.030
was the privatization of
the state oil industry

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.943
and its airline, railroad,
electric, and phone companies.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.210
But the government failed
to convince Bolivians

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:17.765
that water is a commodity like any other.

00:17:17.765 --> 00:17:21.682
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:42.146 --> 00:17:44.365
(yelling)

00:17:44.365 --> 00:17:48.282
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:55.600
Bolivia was determined to
defend the corporation's right

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.843
to charge families living on $2 a day

00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:00.713
as much as one quarter of
their income for water.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.380
The greater the popular resistance

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.630
to the water privatization scheme,

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.079
the more violent became the standoff.

00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:11.246
(yelling)

00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:17.280
- So, this was privatization of the water

00:18:21.675 --> 00:18:23.809
in Cochabamba, Bolivia,

00:18:23.809 --> 00:18:24.892
in attempted,

00:18:28.618 --> 00:18:30.747
at the end of the last century,

00:18:30.747 --> 00:18:33.720
by this corporation, Bechtel,
out of San Francisco.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.570
And this is just to
give you a sense of how

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:41.390
squarely in the mainstream
of Washington Consensus

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.210
privatizations this was.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.180
That water privatization
had been occurring

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.050
in much of the developing world

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:52.710
since the early 1990s.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.290
And as was said in the video,

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:56.820
it was one of the standard things

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.700
that was urged upon,

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.240
which urged upon developing
country governments

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.690
as conditions for getting aid in addition

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:06.800
to other kinds of privatization.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.810
But you can see that even in countries

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:11.773
like Britain and France,

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.800
we've seen increased privatization

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.800
of things like water
supply during this period.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.730
And interestingly, there
were very considerable

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.270
efficiency gains from this privatization.

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:35.090
In Cochabamba, there
had been a lot of people

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:37.890
who were without water,

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.100
or had water one or two days a week.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:46.100
And the Bechtel Corporation
put together a big consortium.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.540
They bid for this contract.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.500
It might have been wise
for them to become nervous

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.220
when they discovered nobody else

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.423
was bidding for this contract.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.340
But they didn't, they
went ahead and did it.

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.760
And as you saw,

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.044
what basically happened was

00:20:04.044 --> 00:20:08.290
as the water came on stream,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.790
that produced more demand for the water,

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:15.150
and the part of the deal
with the Bolivian government

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.000
was that they were going to earn back

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.950
their revenue from selling the water.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:24.300
And of course, the price
of the water then went up

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.110
because there was increased
demand for the water.

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:32.110
And this, Oscar Olivera,
who you saw in the video,

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.810
he didn't look so
charismatic in that video,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.040
but in fact, he is an
extremely charismatic

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.510
and dynamic labor leader.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.040
He pretty much single-handedly

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.183
led the fight against Bechtel.

00:20:48.026 --> 00:20:51.250
As you saw, the government started out

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.410
trying to protect the company.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.880
And this led to massive confrontations

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.610
with these farmers and peasants and others

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:05.160
who thought they, as
was said in the video,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:08.850
they thought, we have
a right to this water.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.960
The notion that people can make money

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.080
out of selling us our own water

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.963
became an incredibly
effective rally and cry.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:24.970
To the point where

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.760
the government finally gave up

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.470
and backed down and
renationalized the water supply.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:36.880
And what happened with Bechtel was

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.910
the Bolivian government just

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:40.777
called them up one day and said,

00:21:40.777 --> 00:21:43.127
"We really don't think we
can protect your people

00:21:43.127 --> 00:21:45.607
"and your property anymore.

00:21:45.607 --> 00:21:47.820
"So you better act accordingly."

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.423
And they packed up and left.

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.170
They then spent the next five
or six years in litigation

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:57.320
over 50 million dollars,

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.470
which they were hoping to get back

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.420
to compensate them for their sunk cost.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:04.760
Finally, they gave up.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.370
There's a wonderful New Yorker article,

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.590
which I should've put on the syllabus,

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.640
called Leasing The Rain,

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.943
which I will,

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.460
I'll post in case anybody is interested,

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.360
that goes through this story.

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.740
But so, here you have people thinking that

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:28.740
even though this was an efficiency
enhancing privatization,

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.810
the costs of it were not worth having.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.710
And indeed, some people thought

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.770
it was something obnoxious
about the very fact

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.770
of privatizing control of water.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.767
Reminds, you might say, it reminds one

00:22:43.767 --> 00:22:46.380
of John Locke's definition of domination

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.140
in the first treaties on government,

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.570
where he defines domination
as being in a position

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.950
to take advantage of another's necessity.

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.543
Water is a necessity.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.530
And so, clearly, people
like that felt this way.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.253
And interestingly, it's not just Bolivia.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:07.920
The week before last,

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.560
the former Tory MP, Rory Stewart,

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.230
kicked out of the party by Boris Johnson

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.703
as one of the 21.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:18.363
Very interesting man, by the way.

00:23:23.203 --> 00:23:25.140
He once walked across Afghanistan.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:26.370
Wrote a book about it.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.020
But in any event, he was
here giving a lecture.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.310
And he talked about the privatization

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.770
of water supply in the UK.

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.710
And he said exactly what
I just said to you here.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.710
He said that actually, it's
been efficiently enhancing.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.910
In this case, it's even,

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.880
it's not more expensive
than it was before,

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.420
and the delivery is better,

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.300
but there's still huge opposition to it

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.420
among many British voters on the grounds,

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.610
that they don't believe
that water should be some,

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.690
supplying people water to drink

00:24:01.973 --> 00:24:05.350
should be something out of which

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.860
money can be made.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.920
So we'll come back to public opinion

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.270
about privatization when we've considered

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.690
a few more examples.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.973
But let's move on to talking
about eminent domain.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.670
What is eminent domain?

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:26.993
Somebody, what is eminent domain?

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.410
As opposed to non-eminent domain.

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.050
(student mumbling)

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:37.883
Yep.

00:24:40.038 --> 00:24:43.020
(student mumbling)

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.530
Exactly, so the right of the government

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.930
to take private property
for a public good.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.730
You said a public good.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.340
We're gonna have to spend a little time

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:56.473
digging into what counts as a public good.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.810
In keeping with my idea
to avoid theorizing,

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:07.260
before we've got some empirical
things out on the table,

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.670
let's start in India now.

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:13.580
And we will talk about
privatizing eminent domain.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.480
This use of government power

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.830
to actually do things
that are a little more

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.250
in the direction of what Donald Trump

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.940
was being accused of by Jeb Bush

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.260
in that opening debate.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.869
So in India, in 1984,

00:25:31.869 --> 00:25:33.630
they had something,

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:38.223
they had a almost century
old Land Acquisition Act,

00:25:39.432 --> 00:25:41.490
which took this term public purpose

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.300
and broadened it to include

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.463
promoting exports, investments,
and public infrastructure.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.730
So this starts to broaden the idea.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:55.690
And then in 2007,

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.980
they widened it further by saying

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:02.120
any purpose useful to the general public

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:07.120
will be counted as allowing
the use of eminent domain.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.070
And then they set up a rule
that worked the following way

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:16.300
because the difficulty with India

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.950
from the point of view
of development is that

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.333
there are millions of very tiny plots.

00:26:25.282 --> 00:26:28.193
Land ownership is highly,

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.320
highly divided up into very
small pieces of ground.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.040
And obviously, that
means if you're gonna use

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.510
the power of eminent domain,

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.140
you're gonna have to deal
with a lot of land owners.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.450
A lot of homeowners.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:45.250
Millions maybe, even.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.410
For some of the more ambitious ones.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.490
And part of what was going on

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.740
in the early post Cold War period

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.460
was that governments were trying to create

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.670
special economic zones.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:00.720
And we're gonna talk more about them

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.900
in other parts of the
world later in the course,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.970
including in Africa.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:07.800
But the idea of a special economic zone

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.750
would be an area in which,

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:13.040
it was essentially to
be a magnet for capital.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.770
So they would say, well,
if you come and invest

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.910
in our special economic zone,

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.090
we'll give you regulatory breaks,

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:21.830
we'll give you tax breaks,

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:26.190
we will protect you
from strikes by unions.

00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:29.100
They are often, therefore,
criticized on the left.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.573
But just to give you a sense.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.380
Since the late '80s,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:41.380
the special economic zones
have just taken off worldwide,

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:46.820
as attempts to jumpstart economies

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:50.480
by creating these,

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.220
if you like, islands that are supposed

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.230
to magnetically attract capital.

00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:58.885
Very popular with governments.

00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:03.050
They're sometimes called
development zones in the US.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.580
Very popular often with governments.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.980
Not so much with economists.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:12.061
Most economists think that
special economic zones

00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:13.833
don't really work,

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.020
for a variety of reasons
that needn't concern us.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.230
Perhaps the biggest exception is China,

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:24.990
where the special economic
zones are enormous.

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.820
And they are essentially sort of

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.030
integrated mini economies,

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.990
and as I mentioned in
my lecture about China,

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.940
the original idea behind the
Chinese special economic zones

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:42.470
was actually islands of
experimentation with capitalism.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:47.470
They wanted to try out
capitalist economies

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:52.530
without transforming the
whole Chinese economy.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.100
This was part of their experimentalism.

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.410
And of course, in China,

00:28:56.410 --> 00:28:59.080
there was not much of a problem about

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.130
moving people around,

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.770
if they were disinclined to move.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.480
So if you look at the difference between,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.583
in the red box here on this slide,

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:15.640
the Chinese and the Indian
special economic zones,

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:20.510
you can see that the
Chinese ones are enormous,

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.500
300 square kilometers,

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.500
whereas the typical Indian
one was 1.4 square kilometers.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:32.630
So, India has this basic problem

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:36.820
that if they want to create
special economic zones

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.730
and they want to use
eminent domain to do that,

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:43.610
and it's a democracy where
there's strong tradition

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:48.610
of citizen opposition to
things that they don't like,

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.230
how are you gonna do it?

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:53.190
So they came up with this 70% rule.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:56.660
And the 70% rule basically
said the following.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.340
It said if a private developer

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:05.030
can buy up 70% of the land
for a perspective development,

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:08.670
whether it's for a single company,

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.620
plant, or for a special economic zone,

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.440
then the local government

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.620
will come in and compulsorily
purchase the other 30%.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.203
And then sell that 30%,

00:30:20.307 --> 00:30:24.525
that 30% would be sold to the company.

00:30:24.525 --> 00:30:28.010
And so, you can see what
the logic would be here.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:31.680
That in order to buy the first 70%,

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.230
the company would have had to have done

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:35.634
a lot of work on the ground
with the local people

00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:40.380
and gotten enough very
significant showing of support

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.733
for what they were going to be doing.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.610
But then there's the
obvious problem of holdouts

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:50.430
that the more you become the veto player

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.850
or the possible veto player

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:57.850
on the decision of this
project to move forward,

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.510
the more you can ransom the whole project

00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:05.300
by demanding a very high price
for a market transaction.

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.020
And so, the thought was,

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.770
didn't seem crazy at the time,

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.580
the thought was the 70% rule will do it.

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:14.020
It sort of splits the difference.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.840
It forces the companies
to do a lot of work

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:18.300
with the citizenry,

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.973
but it also solves the
problem of holdouts.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:29.660
So, this is what came to a head

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:33.890
in the province of Singur in West Bengal

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.340
early on in this century.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.660
And so, the Tata Corporation

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:44.220
wanted to build something called the Nano.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.040
Anyone know what the Tata Nano was?

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.474
Yeah.

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:50.900
(student mumbling)

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.673
The world's cheapest car.

00:31:53.617 --> 00:31:55.980
And this was their marketing ploy.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.280
They wanted to build the
world's cheapest car.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.820
It was gonna cost about $2500.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.840
And they thought this would be,

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.973
I guess it was sort of the VW
Beetle for the 21st century.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.440
Though when we see what
happened to the VW Beetle

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.110
in the run up to World War II,

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:20.430
that might have been a cause for worry,

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:25.030
at least for Tata.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:26.300
But in any event,

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.770
they decided they were going to build

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.430
this world's cheapest car

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.720
for the Indian mass market.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.840
And then the next question
was where to build it.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.380
And so, they decided they
would build it in West Bengal.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:46.683
West Bengal was interesting
for a number of reasons.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.260
And they'd had bids from other parts

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.670
of the country as well.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:54.130
But the area of West Bengal

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:56.930
in which they were planning to build it,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:00.860
very consistent with the
themes of this course,

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.890
was governed by a communist party

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:08.070
that had got the zeal of a
convert about capitalism.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.580
And so, even though it was governed

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.690
by a communist party,

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:15.490
they wanted to get this plant.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.600
They wanted to get Tata

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.500
to come and build this plant.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.620
And so, they worked with

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:30.550
the company and the company
began buying up land.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.980
And when they passed the 70% threshold,

00:33:37.533 --> 00:33:39.620
the single government of West Bengal

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:43.610
compulsory purchased the rest,

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.533
and the project began.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:53.133
So, just to give you a
sense of how it played out.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.100
- [Narrator] In the
countryside outside Calcutta,

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.260
the electoral battle has
turned decidedly nasty.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:04.980
Highlighting some of the problems

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:07.653
of India's industrial expansion.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.390
Five years ago, the communist
government of West Bengal

00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:16.170
moved thousands of farmers off their land

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.910
to make way for a giant car factory,

00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:22.163
owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.640
Some of the farmers, like Mahadad Dass,

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.002
weren't even compensated.

00:34:32.002 --> 00:34:35.919
(speaking in foreign language)

00:34:57.026 --> 00:34:58.650
Sensing a political coup,

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:01.363
the opposition party backed the farmers.

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.600
- So there, you see democracy at work

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.070
because it turned out that this plant

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.383
was in a very marginal constituency.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.730
It had been won by literally

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.270
a handful of votes

00:35:18.270 --> 00:35:22.120
by the communist party
in the previous election.

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.350
And the opposition saw
this as an opportunity

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:28.470
to unhorse the government.

00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:30.293
And so, they got behind,

00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:36.210
and just as with in the Bechtel case,

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:40.530
there was a very charismatic
opposition politician

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.300
who got behind this cause,

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.300
and the farmers began
not only complaining,

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.950
but actually attacking the plant.

00:35:51.617 --> 00:35:54.367
(dramatic music)

00:35:55.846 --> 00:35:59.679
(yelling in foreign language)

00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:07.050
- [Narrator] It's a word
from the Indian Tata Motors

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:08.670
that caused this violence.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:11.360
While Ravi Kant was in the
plant assessing its progress,

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.403
outside the plant, 200
villagers strike and storm in.

00:36:15.403 --> 00:36:16.870
Police and the protesters

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:18.700
engaged in flashes for over an hour,

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:20.300
as tear gas shells were fired,

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.803
which injured two policemen
besides some farmers.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.010
Even as the situation was
brought under control,

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:27.490
the protestors made it difficult

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.210
for them to leave the area,

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.869
setting up blockades along the highway.

00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:36.118
(yelling in foreign language)

00:36:36.118 --> 00:36:37.140
- According to the villagers,

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.150
this kind of sporadic
violence will continue

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.690
in and around these borders.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:40.743
Many farmers are adjudicated

00:36:40.743 --> 00:36:43.870
because they didn't get
jobs as they were promised.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:44.910
- [Narrator] The tension in Singur

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.721
is unlikely to end soon.

00:36:46.721 --> 00:36:49.367
(speaks in foreign language)

00:36:49.367 --> 00:36:50.200
Times Now.

00:36:51.335 --> 00:36:55.156
(yelling in foreign language)

00:36:55.156 --> 00:36:58.060
- And so, it played out very similarly

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.980
to the efforts of Bolivia.

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:02.270
It turned out that even
though the government

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.230
became more and more repressive,

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.513
there came a point where
the cost was too great.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.230
There was something of a standoff.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.827
And finally, Tata said,
"We've had enough".

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:21.590
And they announced that they
were leaving West Bengal,

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.350
and as you can see,

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:27.980
it's not one of the
poorest parts of India,

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.510
but they moved to right
across the country to Gujarat,

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:36.820
which is significantly more developed.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.003
And they built the Tata Nano there.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.800
The whole issue that became the flashpoint

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.063
was this idea of just compensation.

00:37:55.343 --> 00:38:00.343
And you might wonder about
how it was conceived of

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.960
and why it became such a flashpoint.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.280
Because of 70% of the farmers had actually

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.733
already sold their property,

00:38:11.908 --> 00:38:13.170
and it was only the remaining 30

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.830
who were being forced to sell,

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:18.330
you would think that the politics of this

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.283
could have been managed.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.790
But here are some inconvenient facts

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.310
that got in the way of this

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:31.023
transaction being successful.

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.843
And one is that,

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:37.640
India's a relatively weak state,

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.670
and one of the ways in which it's weak

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:42.630
is that people avoid taxes by

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.410
when they transfer land,

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.170
they have an official price
and an unofficial price.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.280
And the unofficial price is
higher than the official price

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.500
because the official price is used

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.330
to calculate the taxes.

00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:55.883
But of course when,

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.918
when the government
compensated people for the land

00:39:01.918 --> 00:39:03.755
they were taking,

00:39:03.755 --> 00:39:06.230
they would use the official price.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.840
And so, people felt like
they were not getting

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.900
the value of their land.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:12.720
To make matters worse,

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.593
once Tata announced the project,

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.310
that the project was going forward,

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.640
the price of land immediately
started to skyrocket.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:28.790
And so, the people who had
sold their land earlier

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.070
felt like they were now getting screwed

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:35.580
because they had sold it
for a much lower price

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.480
than was available on the open market

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:41.940
once the project had been announced.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.993
And to exacerbate that problem,

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.813
some people who figured
out what was coming down,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.340
sort of became middle man

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.270
and ran around buying up lots of land,

00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.063
so that they could bid up
the price and sell it later.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.563
This really meant that the moral,

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:10.140
the 70% rule created
a kind of moral hazard

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.440
because it meant that people

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:15.300
could hold out for a higher price,

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:19.593
even though it was intended
to defeat the holdout problem.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:23.890
And then finally, and perhaps as you saw

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:27.130
from the interview with that farmer,

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:31.630
many of these farmers who
were being thrown off the land

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:35.350
were not gonna get jobs
working in the Tata plant.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:38.920
That was semiskilled
work, these were farmers.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:42.330
And so, what were they
actually going to do?

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.113
Even if they had been
compensated for their land.

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:51.723
Rajat Tata, that's him there,

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.420
CEO of Tata, actually
a very well respected

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.870
and well liked company in India.

00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.740
So this was quite an unusual

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:05.700
catastrophe for them.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:09.760
Even though he left 350
million dollars on the table

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.280
in West Bengal,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.030
he decided he'd cut his losses.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.423
And here, you can see the
plant opening in Gujarat.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.770
A footnote to this story is that

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:25.520
this is the first Nano
being produced in Gujarat.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.610
But it turned out that it was not

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.513
a successful car, by the way.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.350
The reason being that

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:37.647
people don't want to be driving
the world's cheapest car.

00:41:37.647 --> 00:41:38.950
(laughing)

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:43.590
They think, well, this is a status economy

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:45.896
as well as an economic economy.

00:41:45.896 --> 00:41:50.180
So, they've done many back flips

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:54.800
to try and rescue the Nano.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.113
But it hasn't been an economic success.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.380
Unfortunately though, this is what's left

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.730
of the defunct plant in West Bengal.

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:11.970
The land continued to belong
to the Tata Corporation,

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.993
and most of it has not
gone back to farming.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:21.090
So here again you see a case where

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:24.900
the losers from a privatization effort,

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:29.560
using the concept of eminent domain

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.030
as a vehicle for promoting
economic development,

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:36.170
backfires because the
people who are gonna be

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.200
harmed by it or who believe they're gonna

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.747
be harmed by it get mobilized,

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:46.220
and incidentally, the opposition party

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.270
did knock off the communist government

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.793
in the next election.

00:42:51.303 --> 00:42:54.060
So, it worked to that extent.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.330
So these are some cases,

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.900
the Bolivia and the Indian case,

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.540
to remind us that when we talk about

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.030
neoliberalism and the
Washington Consensus,

00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:08.580
we should always remember
that it's important

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.610
to think about how these things look

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:12.500
from other parts of the world,

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.900
and not just as they articulated

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.280
by policy wonks in Washington

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:20.424
or in the World Bank

00:43:20.424 --> 00:43:24.623
or among Western academics.

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:30.180
So, let's talk about the US.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:33.920
Privatizing eminent domain in the US.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:38.920
Now we have something
called the Takings Clause

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.580
in the Fifth Amendment,

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.700
and the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment,

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.260
for the lawyers here will know,

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:49.080
the Due Process Clause of
the 14th Amendment applies

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.970
the Fifth Amendment to the States,

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:54.500
and it says that people shall,

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.167
the last clause of it,

00:43:56.167 --> 00:43:59.687
"nor shall private property
be taken for public use

00:43:59.687 --> 00:44:02.747
"without just compensation".

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:06.940
So we've seen that in India,

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:11.400
they had this very capacious
definition of public use

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.580
to enable economic
development in West Bengal

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.700
that produced a certain
amount of backlash.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.900
But how should we think about public use?

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:24.310
What is a public use?

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:25.723
Many people would say, well,

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.090
Donald Trump's casinos
aren't public use either.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:31.810
So what is a public use?

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:34.610
How do we know a public use

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.173
when we trip over it?

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.770
- [Student] Benefits the public.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:43.670
- Pardon?

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:44.800
- [Student] It benefits the public.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.270
- Benefits the public, okay.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:48.103
Well.

00:44:50.873 --> 00:44:53.870
That could be part of it, but presumably,

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.643
economic growth benefits the public.

00:44:58.176 --> 00:45:01.154
And this was the argument

00:45:01.154 --> 00:45:04.890
for what was being done in West Bengal.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.040
What more can we say about public--

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.090
- [Student] Clear public entity.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.320
Clearly a public entity.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.693
- A public entity.

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:14.623
Like?

00:45:15.851 --> 00:45:17.530
- [Student] School.

00:45:17.530 --> 00:45:18.549
A school.

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:20.300
- A school.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.680
Well, there are a lot of
private schools but yeah.

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.090
Okay.

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:28.110
So one place one might start,

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.100
we shouldn't always start
with the economists,

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:33.480
but the economists have a
definition of a public good.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.040
Can anyone tell me what would an economist

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.210
tell us is a public good?

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:39.605
Yeah.

00:45:39.605 --> 00:45:41.330
- [Student] Non-competitive,
non-excludable.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:46.210
- Okay, so you said non-excludable.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.280
Was your second criteria.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.563
And what does that mean?

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.342
- [Student] One person
having it doesn't exclude

00:45:52.342 --> 00:45:54.740
another person from having it.

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:58.350
- If we create clean air for you,

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:02.120
we can't exclude the person
next to you from having

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.940
the clean air as well, right?

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.760
So that's one feature of the definition

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.150
of a public good.

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:12.470
If you provide it, everybody's
gonna get the benefit of it.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:15.630
So that obviously creates
incentive to free ride

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:18.320
because if I'm gonna
get the benefit anyway,

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.470
why would I pay for it?

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.300
If somebody else is
gonna pay to provide it.

00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.650
So that's one element of a public good.

00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:30.650
And then you said, the other element?

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:33.030
- [Student] Non-competitive.

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.487
- Right, sometimes non-rivalrous.

00:46:35.487 --> 00:46:36.913
And what does that mean?

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:45.160
What is non-competitive or
non-rivalrous mean, somebody?

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.303
Some economist.

00:46:47.478 --> 00:46:50.183
Have I frightened every
economist out of here already?

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:55.440
(student mumbling)

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.470
Yeah, it's basically the ideas that

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.750
my having it doesn't

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.760
stop you enjoying it.

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.730
So, sunshine.

00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:10.730
My consuming sunshine doesn't
stop you consuming sunshine.

00:47:15.673 --> 00:47:17.070
We don't need,

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:20.593
we're not rivals for the sunshine.

00:47:22.766 --> 00:47:24.940
So, that's the idea of a public good.

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.750
But notice that even
if you start with such

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:31.910
this narrow technical
definition of a public good,

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:36.573
of things that are non-rivalrous
and non-excludable,

00:47:39.503 --> 00:47:42.460
they're still gonna be
politically charged.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.647
Why are they gonna be politically charged?

00:47:44.647 --> 00:47:47.280
One is because there are alternatives.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.853
So if we think about building a road.

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:54.650
If you build a road,

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:57.170
anybody can use the road.

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:00.400
And if you build the road,

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.980
my using it doesn't,

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.610
it doesn't use up the road.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:06.180
You can also use the road.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:09.060
We can't exclude you and
it's non-competitive.

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.830
But of course, rather than
building the road here,

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.063
we could've built the road someplace else.

00:48:15.699 --> 00:48:16.532
So, there's still,

00:48:16.532 --> 00:48:19.810
there are always gonna be
alternative courses of action

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:21.860
that might have been taken.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:26.124
There is now a plan to
build a high speed rail,

00:48:26.124 --> 00:48:27.325
which I'm sure will never be built,

00:48:27.325 --> 00:48:28.961
(laughing)

00:48:28.961 --> 00:48:32.180
from Washington to Boston,

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:36.950
and the current plan goes to
Hartford, bypassing New Haven.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:39.350
60 billion dollar enterprise.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.540
And of course, the negative externalities

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:47.220
of that for Yale would be huge.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.790
It would be much better
if the high speed rail

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.530
went through New Haven.

00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:53.500
So even when you're providing what

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.570
is technically understood
as a public good,

00:48:56.570 --> 00:49:01.240
there's always gonna be more
than one way to provide it.

00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.210
And there'll be winners and losers,

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:06.943
depending on which way is chosen.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:11.330
Then secondly, there are
gonna be externalities.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:13.950
What economists call externalities.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.570
There are gonna be costs,
wherever you put it,

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:19.540
that some people will have to bear.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.200
So even if it had been the case that

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.240
the Tata plant in West Bengal

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:27.770
would have jumpstarted the economy,

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.210
brought lots of employment,

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:31.450
would have brought other
industries to the region,

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:35.420
would've been a net benefit
by just about any definition,

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.880
these farmers would still have paid

00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:40.210
a substantial price
because they were getting

00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:42.100
kicked off their land,

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.270
and they were not likely to be employable

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.010
in the new industries.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:48.853
So even if our net,

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.643
we say that providing a public good

00:49:53.643 --> 00:49:56.730
is desirable,

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:59.040
it's still gonna have externalities.

00:49:59.040 --> 00:50:02.670
And you have to worry
about the externalities.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.930
And then finally,

00:50:03.930 --> 00:50:06.660
you're gonna have the
problems of valuation

00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:08.750
that we talked about before.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:11.240
When you do eminent domain,

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:13.960
it's compulsory purchase, and so,

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.163
you have to decide,

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:18.920
what is the right value?

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.860
And of course, there are various
mechanisms for doing that.

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.280
Looking at the value of houses

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.083
around the house that you're
gonna compulsory purchase.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:33.600
But there may be

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.273
problems with the market, or at least,

00:50:36.273 --> 00:50:39.470
the people living in
the house may perceive

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.050
problems with the market,

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.840
or it may be that I
was born in this house,

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.150
my grandmother was born in this house,

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:49.620
I value this house differently than

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.760
I could sell it for on the market.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:55.290
And so, you're gonna get
those sorts of problems,

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:57.310
and the sorts of,

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:00.010
if you try and get around
the holdout problem

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:03.660
with something like India's 70% rule,

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.280
you're not going to persuade the holdouts.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:07.580
In fact, what you've just,

00:51:08.586 --> 00:51:10.540
what you basically do is you shift

00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:14.110
the holdout problem near the 70% threshold

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:17.120
rather than near the 100% threshold.

00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.440
So there's gonna be,

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.780
even if you start with
a very narrow definition

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.180
of public purpose,

00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:27.350
it's always gonna be politically charged.

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:28.783
And in reality,

00:51:29.630 --> 00:51:31.930
there's almost no government in the world

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:35.990
that sticks to such a narrow definition

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:37.620
of a public purpose

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:44.390
as a technically what
counts as a public good.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:47.930
So, this all came to
a head in Connecticut,

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:51.190
here in Connecticut 14 years ago,

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:55.610
in a case called Kelo versus
the City of New London.

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:58.840
And it was a very interesting

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.280
and controversial case

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:02.970
because it was

00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:07.140
exactly the use of eminent domain

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:10.923
to facilitate a purely
private transaction.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.220
Basically, the City of Kelo,

00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:17.160
which was not a blighted area,

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:21.220
there had been some previous
Supreme Court decisions

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:25.190
which had said if an
area is truly blighted,

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:27.740
then compulsory purchasing can be done,

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:32.740
if there's some plan to revitalize it.

00:52:37.773 --> 00:52:39.960
This was not an area of blight,

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:41.033
and by the way,

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.370
anyone who knows about
the history of debates

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:47.603
about urban renewal will know that even

00:52:47.603 --> 00:52:50.290
compulsory purchase of blighted areas,

00:52:50.290 --> 00:52:52.830
go take a look at their remains

00:52:52.830 --> 00:52:56.153
of the Oak Street Connector
in downtown New Haven.

00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:59.570
Or read Douglas Rae's
brilliant book called

00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:01.580
City: Urbanism and Its End

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:06.580
if you want to know about urban blight

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:09.730
as not being eradicated successfully

00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:12.060
through eminent domain purchases.

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.750
In any event,

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:15.920
this went way beyond blight,

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.200
and the City of New London had an offer

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.163
to build a shopping mall.

00:53:23.527 --> 00:53:27.260
And they used the eminent domain power

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.720
to force that transaction through.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.060
And they compulsory purchased some homes,

00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.790
forced people out of them,

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:36.320
and compensated them,

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:40.810
and justified, of course, they were sued.

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:42.730
It worked its way up

00:53:44.250 --> 00:53:47.073
through the courts in Connecticut.

00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:50.200
But the defense of it
was that it would bring

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.080
economic growth, employment,

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.910
and higher tax revenues
for the City of New London.

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:59.570
And what was remarkable about this

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:02.240
was it went all the way
to the Supreme Court

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:06.553
and the City of New London won.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:11.270
They won in a five to four decision,

00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:13.420
and the decision, interestingly,

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.960
was written by what we think of

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:21.640
as the less Conservative wing
of the court in those days.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.383
So, it was Justice Stevens with Kennedy,

00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:29.320
Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:33.150
They all said, well, if
careful studies have been done

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:36.880
and it's clearly going
to bring economic growth

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.880
and employment and higher tax revenues

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.690
to the City of New London,

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:44.040
it can go forward.

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.610
And so, it actually survived.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:48.740
And it was the Conservatives
who we tend to think

00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:53.503
like capitalism and like
economic development.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:58.680
Sandra Day O'Connor, then
Chief Justice Rehnquist,

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.500
Scalia, and Thomas dissented

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:05.750
with a strong defense of property rights.

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:09.157
As O'Connor put it in
her dissent, she said,

00:55:09.157 --> 00:55:11.327
"To reason, as the Court does,

00:55:11.327 --> 00:55:14.277
"that the incidental public
benefits resulting from

00:55:14.277 --> 00:55:17.387
"the subsequent ordinary
use of private property

00:55:17.387 --> 00:55:21.287
"render economic development
takings for public use

00:55:21.287 --> 00:55:23.927
"is to wash out any distinction between

00:55:23.927 --> 00:55:26.357
"private and public use of property,

00:55:26.357 --> 00:55:29.147
"and thereby effectively
to delete the word

00:55:29.147 --> 00:55:32.487
"for public use from the Takings Clause

00:55:32.487 --> 00:55:34.410
"of the Fifth Amendment."

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:35.680
And she basically is saying

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:37.950
once you can do it for this,

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:40.980
you can do it for anything.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:45.000
And so, the Takings Clause
really doesn't offer

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:48.713
much in the way of real protection.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:54.760
So, that was a pretty dramatic occurrence.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:59.670
It's more dramatic than
the 70% rule in India.

00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:03.690
It's actually saying if
a local city government

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:07.970
can convince itself

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:10.690
and perhaps some fact finding body

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.950
that this is gonna be good for the city,

00:56:12.950 --> 00:56:17.540
they can compulsory purchase land.

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:20.480
And though we didn't have riots

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.730
the way that we saw riots in Bolivia

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:27.130
and we saw riots in West Bengal,

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.583
there was huge backlash to this decision.

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.060
And interestingly,

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:36.730
it was a coalition of strange bedfellows

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.690
that were opposed to this.

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:41.640
It was groups like the AARP,

00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:46.570
the NAACP, the Libertarian Party,

00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:50.343
and Conservative think thanks
all came out against it.

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.613
And president then, George W. Bush,

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:01.500
announced an executive order

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:06.500
that federal funds could
not be used to facilitate

00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.960
private use of eminent domain in this way.

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.130
And before the Kelo decisions,

00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:21.070
only eight states had had
limitations of this sort

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.810
on the use of eminent domain power

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:26.180
to facilitate private transactions.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.430
As of April of this year,

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:32.123
45 states had enacted curbs upon it.

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.070
So, as you can see,

00:57:36.070 --> 00:57:40.680
the forward use of the
eminent domain power

00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:44.300
actually triggered backlash.

00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:49.300
And as with the Tata Nano
plant in Singur, West Bengal,

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:55.549
it turns out the
development never occurred.

00:57:55.549 --> 00:57:58.130
And you can, there's now a movie

00:57:58.130 --> 00:58:02.520
about this whole episode,
which you can watch.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:06.870
So the upshot of this
discussion so far is that

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:12.540
neither efficiency, as in the
case of water privatizations,

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.810
nor just compensation,

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:19.230
even if it's effectuated in terms that

00:58:19.230 --> 00:58:22.343
an economist would approve of,

00:58:23.310 --> 00:58:27.060
might be sufficient to grease
the wheels of privatization.

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.860
In fact, you might run into problems.

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.080
Loss aversion might be
more important to people

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.530
than just compensation.

00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.950
They may not want to give up their home,

00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.480
or they may not want to
retrain to learn how to work

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.783
in a car factory.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.910
Unanticipated externalities can trigger

00:58:48.910 --> 00:58:50.550
very effective opposition,

00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:55.140
particularly when there's
a political entrepreneur

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.783
to mobilize that opposition.

00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.910
And the most important takeaway is that

00:59:02.910 --> 00:59:05.370
there's no technical
answer to this question.

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:08.713
It's not having the
right theoretical model.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.440
These are just political questions

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:16.440
where there are distributive
benefits and burdens

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.890
that are gonna be born,

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:20.830
no matter what's done or what's not done.

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:23.750
And so, it's really, at the
end of the day, political.

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:24.930
And in that sense,

00:59:24.930 --> 00:59:27.840
you can't ring the
politics out of politics

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.070
by trying to have a fancy model

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:33.290
to tell you the answer.

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:35.770
The answer's gonna depend upon

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:39.650
figuring out who's going to benefit

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:41.920
and who's going to be harmed,

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:45.410
and then making sure that the people

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:46.970
who are going to be harmed

00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:49.700
are not mobilized to stop the project,

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:52.210
possibly by compensating them

00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:56.513
or by finding out what else
you can do to help them.

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:02.423
Let's talk about privatizing
local government services.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:08.510
There's a link to the
previous class in this

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:11.280
that we talked about how the agenda

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.220
of the anti-tax movement

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.940
was to starve the beast,

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:19.350
to reduce the amount of
money available to government

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:21.820
on the theory that governments either

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.580
waste it or further
their own nest with it.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:28.310
And if you look, if you go back to,

01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:31.300
I started with Proposition 13 last time,

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.030
you can see,

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:38.010
indeed, after Proposition 13 was enacted,

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:41.363
local government revenues in
California just plummeted.

01:00:43.501 --> 01:00:45.010
And cities and counties

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:49.360
where the same kinds of
propositions have been adopted

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:54.050
have found themself increasingly
starved for revenue.

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:57.080
So you can see in the second slide,

01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.345
it's the right hand slide there,

01:00:59.345 --> 01:01:02.912
to extent, they can raise revenue.

01:01:02.912 --> 01:01:07.912
They've had to depend on things
other than real estate taxes

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:11.540
because of the bars on raising money

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.190
in the ways that they
traditionally had done.

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:17.000
And if you look at California,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
the growth, this would make
the Proposition 13 crowd happy.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:26.700
The California has,
local government revenues

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.260
have indeed grown more
slowly than elsewhere

01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:34.620
and contributed to many
of its fiscal woes.

01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:36.840
So, one of the ways in which

01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.660
local governments have
responded to this reality

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:43.700
is by moving towards

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.547
privatizing local government.

01:01:45.547 --> 01:01:47.480
And what do I mean by that?

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.990
It's basically they have
moved towards these things

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:52.880
that Evan McKenzie writes about

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.803
called common interest developments.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.533
What is a common interest development?

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.313
Yeah.

01:02:07.687 --> 01:02:10.604
(student mumbling)

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:24.400
Right, they're sort of
giant condo associations.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:28.910
Where you own your unit that you live in.

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:33.590
But you pay a fee to the association,

01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:35.910
and the association then

01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:39.003
delivers a lot of services.

01:02:40.036 --> 01:02:41.830
They arrange for a snow removal

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:45.590
if it's in New England, not in California.

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.150
Most of California, not
Southern California.

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:51.960
But they arrange for garbage pickup,

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.903
sewage, some of them local policing,

01:02:57.742 --> 01:03:00.540
you can get your hot water through them.

01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:04.510
So you get a lot of services that would

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:07.870
traditionally have been
provided by local governments

01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:10.373
from the common interest development.

01:03:12.436 --> 01:03:14.830
And this is obviously attractive

01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:17.510
to cash strapped local governments

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:21.920
because they find the provision
of services expensive.

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:24.760
And now it's much harder, as we've seen,

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:27.540
for them to raise revenue in the ways

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:30.130
that they typically have done.

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:34.520
And so, in a lot of these kinds of states,

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.060
you find cities that actually,

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:41.920
the only form of new
housing building they permit

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.200
is common interest developments.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:48.110
And so, to give you some
sense of the numbers here,

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.283
they're really quite dramatic.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:55.470
Go back to 1964.

01:03:55.470 --> 01:03:59.083
There were fewer than 500
of them in the country.

01:04:01.660 --> 01:04:03.570
And you can see,

01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:07.260
after the anti-tax movement gets going,

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.340
they just start to skyrocket.

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.023
And this is now 10 years ago.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.610
I couldn't find aggregate statistics

01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:17.030
more recently than that.

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.143
But by 2009,

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:25.210
we had 24 and a half
million housing units,

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:27.467
60.1 million people,

01:04:27.467 --> 01:04:31.500
and almost a fifth of
the American population

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:35.230
is now living in these
common interest developments.

01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:40.230
And I'm sure that number is
significantly higher today

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:44.900
than it was a decade ago.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:48.110
That's more than the population
of many, many countries.

01:04:48.110 --> 01:04:51.930
60 million people are living
in these developments.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:53.500
And as I said,

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.760
a number of cities,

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.223
particularly in California,
in Arizona, in Florida,

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.613
will not allow any other
kinds of development.

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.562
So it's a big change.

01:05:06.562 --> 01:05:09.790
It's a big change over
the last several years,

01:05:09.790 --> 01:05:14.790
in large part, driven by the cost savings

01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.340
for local governments.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.390
They get to double dip, if you like,

01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:20.320
because they get to,

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:23.370
you still have to pay property taxes,

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:26.330
but they don't have to provide you with

01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:29.580
anything like the number of services

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.092
that they have to provide

01:05:33.092 --> 01:05:35.563
to other homeowners.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.190
So what should we think about that?

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:41.863
What are the consequences of
that for democratic politics?

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:50.356
(student mumbling)

01:05:50.356 --> 01:05:54.957
Take the mic for him, yeah.

01:05:54.957 --> 01:05:57.874
(student mumbling)

01:06:09.774 --> 01:06:11.120
So they're private, essentially,

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.100
private governments in these developments.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.483
They're usually boards.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.680
Sometimes, they're elected boards.

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.670
But typically, the way
it works is the developer

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:27.380
creates a board when they're building it.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.740
And that board will decide

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:33.800
what type of housing they're gonna build,

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:38.800
is it gonna be a development
that permits animals,

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:41.020
is it gonna be a retirement development,

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.580
no children below a certain age.

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.900
What the basic structure
and rules are gonna be

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.730
is gonna be set by this board,

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:52.010
and then people will have
to come in on that basis.

01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:55.170
And he'll have essentially a charter,

01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:59.050
constitution, which will likely
be very difficult to change

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:02.110
because the initial homeowners

01:07:02.110 --> 01:07:06.020
will not want the rules to be
changed on them in midstream.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.470
And so, you're gonna essentially have

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:13.470
private government of a
lot of local activities.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:17.020
Now some might say, well,
so what's wrong with that?

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.610
People can pick and choose.

01:07:18.610 --> 01:07:21.243
I mean, you go to Fort Lauderdale.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.093
And you can see,

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:32.130
by the water, these developments
go for millions of dollars.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:36.560
Then you go quarter of a mile
back and they're cheaper,

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:38.100
quarter of a mile back, they're cheaper,

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.090
and people could sort into just

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.393
the kinds of housing that they want.

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.770
The market is hunky-dory here.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:49.240
Everybody can, if you don't like animals,

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.560
go live in one that doesn't like animals.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:54.340
If you, doesn't allow animals.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:59.340
If you want access to a swimming pool,

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.660
you go to one that has swimming pool

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:03.243
and you pay a little bit more.

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:07.493
So, you could say, one might say,

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:10.203
there's no problem with this.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.053
Yep.

01:08:16.900 --> 01:08:18.720
- [Student] One of the
bigger issues is the people

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.310
who are elected to serve
on these elected boards

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:23.280
might not have the expertise needed

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.840
to properly run the different utilities

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.230
or any of the different
elements of the government.

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:30.420
Of the internal government.

01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:33.070
- So there can be accountability problems

01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:36.420
because the boards tend to be
run by amateurs, as you say,

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:38.610
and they might be quite incompetent.

01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:39.920
They turn out not to be able

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.283
to manage the accounts and so on.

01:08:44.850 --> 01:08:47.170
If we had a little bit more time,

01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:48.840
we could work our way through

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.833
a number of those kinds
of issues that pop up.

01:08:53.881 --> 01:08:56.010
And which have caused a demand

01:08:56.010 --> 01:09:00.590
for regulating these boards and so on.

01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:03.540
It still could be a problem that

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.940
your neighbor stopped
paying their condo fees

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:08.430
and the thing goes bankrupt

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:11.600
and it's very difficult
for you to have redress

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.520
in these situations.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:16.030
So there are a lot of those issues.

01:09:16.030 --> 01:09:18.990
Any other issues we
should be thinking about?

01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:20.100
Yeah, at the back.

01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.300
You have to yell or
wait for the microphone.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.580
(student mumbling)

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.623
The microphone's gotten to you now.

01:09:28.568 --> 01:09:31.290
(laughing)

01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:32.430
- [Student] I meant that no judges

01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:34.210
can overturn the decisions of the board,

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:38.280
the courts, then not to be
involved with these CIDs.

01:09:40.683 --> 01:09:42.790
- So, you have to explain what you mean.

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:44.740
- [Student] So that in the readings,

01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.430
there was a lot of people
who wanted to sue the boards

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:48.770
and the judges that they didn't

01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:51.910
want to become involved
with these associations.

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:54.500
- Yeah, so there's
potential for incompetence

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:58.181
and corruption and related things.

01:09:58.181 --> 01:10:00.700
Those things are all true.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.410
However, there's the same potential

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.683
for all of those things
in local government.

01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:10.440
So I think that the things to think about

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.980
that are gonna be
significant going forward

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:16.380
is one, is the boards
can be quite undemocratic

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.530
because they usually, as I said,

01:10:19.530 --> 01:10:22.150
the dice is loaded early on.

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:23.313
But also,

01:10:24.539 --> 01:10:26.810
we talked earlier about Hirschman's

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:30.030
Exit, Voice, and Loyalty.

01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:32.520
There are problems here about entry

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.840
because if all the housing

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.150
in a part of the country

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:39.230
is built in these developments

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:42.150
that pick the markets
that they want to serve,

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.770
what about homeless people?

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:46.010
Where are homeless people gonna wind up?

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:48.570
They're gonna wind up on
the streets of San Francisco

01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:50.800
or somewhere like that.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.440
That because if you want to
buy into one of these places,

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.920
of course you've gotta,

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.410
they don't want you unless
they're sure that you can pay,

01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:02.920
so you're gonna go through
financial screening,

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.050
you're gonna have to prove you can afford

01:11:05.050 --> 01:11:06.270
to live in the place.

01:11:06.270 --> 01:11:08.780
And people who can't are going to be

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.900
wind up not being served.

01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:12.040
There's gonna be a big mark.

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:15.730
If you try and do housing
through this kind of market,

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.940
there's gonna be a market failure

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.320
that is gonna be probably quite costly

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.383
for governments to attend to.

01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:27.763
A third difficulty.

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.480
Two related things.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.470
One, I mentioned Douglas Rae earlier.

01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:36.170
But his book about urban politics.

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:39.680
But he has an essay
called Tyrannies of Place

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.170
where he points to the
fact quite prescient.

01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:46.090
He wrote this more than 25 years ago.

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:49.530
That we're increasingly
becoming a segmented democracy.

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:52.880
That is, people tend to spend time

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:55.580
around people like themselves.

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:58.210
And this, of course,
greatly facilitates that

01:11:58.210 --> 01:12:02.170
because people will sort by income,

01:12:02.170 --> 01:12:04.650
if you go to the ones in Florida,

01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:06.530
often by ethnic groups,

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:09.833
into these relatively homogeneous,

01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:14.370
certainly financially homogeneous, groups.

01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:17.850
And we know from Khaneman, who
I've mentioned to you before,

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:22.850
and his research with Cass Sunstein,

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.270
lately of the federal government

01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:26.970
and in the Obama Administration,

01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:29.330
now back at the Harvard Law School,

01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:33.870
but like-minded people, if
they just talk to one another,

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:35.970
tend to become more extreme.

01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:39.630
And so, if we get an
increasingly segmented democracy

01:12:39.630 --> 01:12:42.310
of people only hanging around people

01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:45.600
who look and talk like themselves,

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.070
this will reinforce a lot of the divisions

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:53.050
that are contributing to
polarization of the electorate.

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:56.680
And when we talk next week
about the segmentation

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.100
of media markets,

01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.910
we'll see that this reinforces that trend.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.770
That sort of out of sight, out of mind

01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:06.493
of people not like yourself.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:12.173
So, a final point I would make is that

01:13:12.173 --> 01:13:15.140
these organizations are here to stay.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:19.289
If you go back and look
at McKenzie's first book,

01:13:19.289 --> 01:13:23.320
which he published in 1996, Privatopia,

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.930
the tone of that book
is, this is terrible.

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:28.630
The sky is falling.

01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:30.980
These things should be stopped.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:34.640
For all the reasons I've
mentioned and other reasons.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.520
But the chapter I gave you
from his book from 2011,

01:13:40.460 --> 01:13:42.950
the tone is completely different.

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:47.260
There are 25 million of these things here

01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:49.250
that are here to stay,

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:51.310
and figuring out how to manage them

01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:53.650
and manage with them is really

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:56.420
the order of business going forward.

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:58.520
Okay, on Thursday we will talk about

01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.983
prisons and the military.

01:14:03.471 --> 01:14:05.888
(soft music)

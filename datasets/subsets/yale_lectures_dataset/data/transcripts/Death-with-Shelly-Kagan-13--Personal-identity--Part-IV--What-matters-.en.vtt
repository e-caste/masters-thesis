00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.522
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Let me start by reviewing the

00:00:04.522 --> 00:00:07.210
problem that we were considering
last week.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.711
We were raising a difficulty
for the personality theory of

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:14.458
personal identity according to
which the key to being the same

00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:17.100
person is having the very same
ongoing,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.969
evolving personality.
And the difficulty was

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:24.060
basically the problem of
duplication.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.955
That it seemed as though we
could have more than one--call

00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:30.620
it an individual--more than one
body,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.650
that had the very same set of
memories, beliefs and so forth.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.130
And that we have to ask
ourselves, "Well,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.540
what should the personality
theory say about a case like

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.728
that?"
So imagine that over the

00:00:43.728 --> 00:00:48.543
weekend, the mad scientist
copied my memories,

00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:51.120
beliefs,
desires, fears,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.415
ambitions, goals,
intentions and imprinted that

00:00:55.415 --> 00:01:00.122
on somebody else's brain.
They did it last night at

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:05.450
midnight.
This morning, we woke up.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.829
And we have to ask ourselves,
"Who's Shelly Kagan?

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:12.400
Who's the person that was
lecturing to you last week?"

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.106
Well, it doesn't seem plausible
in terms of the personality

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:20.840
theory to say that he's
Shelly Kagan,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.650
and the one here today--Suppose
the other one's in Michigan.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.168
If the one in Michigan's Shelly
Kagan but this one's not--After

00:01:28.168 --> 00:01:31.062
all, although it's true that
he's got Shelly Kagan's

00:01:31.062 --> 00:01:33.067
memories,
he woke up thinking he was

00:01:33.067 --> 00:01:35.164
Shelly Kagan,
just like I woke up thinking I

00:01:35.164 --> 00:01:37.578
was Shelly Kagan.
He woke up thinking about what

00:01:37.578 --> 00:01:40.504
he was going to lecture on in
class today, just like I woke up

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:43.430
thinking about what I was going
to lecture in class today.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.058
He remembered last week's
lecture just like I remembered

00:01:46.058 --> 00:01:49.099
last week's lecture.
Well, no clear reason to

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:54.156
say--for the personality theory
to say--that he's Shelly Kagan

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:57.227
and I'm not.
After all, I've got the very

00:01:57.227 --> 00:02:00.620
same set of memories,
beliefs, desires that he has.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.086
But equally true,
and more surprisingly,

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:05.870
from the personality theory
point of view,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.942
there's no reason to say that
I'm Shelly Kagan and

00:02:08.942 --> 00:02:12.396
he's not.
After all, he's got all the

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:16.599
same memories,
beliefs and desires that I do.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.681
It doesn't seem plausible to
say we're both Shelly

00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:23.039
Kagan, because now we'd have to
then say Shelly Kagan's in two

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:26.888
places at the same time.
So the only alternative seems

00:02:26.888 --> 00:02:30.789
to be to say that neither of us
is Shelly Kagan.

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:34.615
But if neither of us is Shelly
Kagan, then the simple original

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:37.978
personality theory was false.
Because according to that

00:02:37.978 --> 00:02:41.269
theory, having the personality
is what it took to be Shelly

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.627
Kagan.
We both have it,

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:44.479
yet neither of us is Shelly
Kagan.

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.160
The personality theory must be
false.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.678
So we revise the personality
theory to say,

00:02:49.678 --> 00:02:53.783
the secret to personal identity
is having the same

00:02:53.783 --> 00:02:58.140
personality--provided that
there's no branching.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.729
Provided there's no splitting.
Provided there's only one best

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:06.539
competitor, not two equally good
candidates.

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:10.340
Given the no branching view,
the no branching rule,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.000
we can say, in the ordinary
case,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.888
look, there really wasn't
anybody imprinted with my

00:03:15.888 --> 00:03:17.909
memories and desires in
Michigan.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.226
I'm the only one around in the
earth right now with Shelly

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:24.879
Kagan's memories and desires.
Since there's no competitor,

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.050
and I've got the personality,
I'm Shelly Kagan.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.384
I'm the very same person that
was here lecturing to you last

00:03:31.384 --> 00:03:33.207
week.
That's what the personality

00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:36.061
theory--It gives us the answer
we're looking for in the

00:03:36.061 --> 00:03:38.713
ordinary case.
But in the science fiction

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:41.682
story where there's a duplicate,
it says, uh,

00:03:41.682 --> 00:03:45.460
if there's branching,
the no branching rule comes in.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.139
Neither of them is Shelly Kagan.
All right, so that's the best

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:53.494
way for the personality theory
to get revised to deal with this

00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:55.039
problem.
The trouble was,

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:58.660
it seems the no branching rule
seems very counter-intuitive.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.178
So think about it.
Here, right now I'm standing in

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:04.975
front of you saying I'm Shelly
Kagan, the guy who was lecturing

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:07.709
to you last week.
I believe I'm Shelly Kagan,

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.170
the guy who was lecturing to
you last week.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.130
Am I Shelly Kagan?
Well, I've got Shelly Kagan's

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.930
personality.
So far so good.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.064
Now all we have to decide is,
was the branching rule

00:04:18.064 --> 00:04:21.100
satisfied or violated?
So all we have to know is,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.279
is there somebody else
somewhere in the universe who's

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:27.100
got all my memories and beliefs
and desires?

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.709
Well, how in the world could I
know that?

00:04:30.709 --> 00:04:34.239
Whether I, this person talking
to you right now,

00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:38.445
is Shelly Kagan depends on
whether there's some duplicate

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:41.750
with all my memories in Michigan
or not?

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.477
It seems very counter-intuitive.
So although the personality

00:04:47.477 --> 00:04:53.774
with no branching rule avoids
the problem of what to say about

00:04:53.774 --> 00:04:56.666
duplicates,
by saying when there's

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:59.427
branching, neither of them is
Shelly Kagan,

00:04:59.427 --> 00:05:03.240
the branching rule itself seems
very counter-intuitive.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.487
We feel as though whether
somebody is me or not should

00:05:06.487 --> 00:05:10.408
depend upon internal facts about
me in the earlier stages or this

00:05:10.408 --> 00:05:15.003
stage and that stage,
not about what's happening

00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:20.540
elsewhere, outside,
extrinsic to these things.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.434
So, if you're not willing to
accept the no branching rule,

00:05:23.434 --> 00:05:26.429
if it strikes you as a bizarre
thing to throw in to personal

00:05:26.429 --> 00:05:28.921
identity,
maybe you need to reject the

00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:32.325
personality theory.
Now during all of this,

00:05:32.325 --> 00:05:36.879
the fans of the body view
typically are laughing.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:42.283
They say this just goes to show
what a dumb theory the

00:05:42.283 --> 00:05:46.307
personality theory is.
The whole problem with the

00:05:46.307 --> 00:05:49.522
personality theory is that
personality is a bit like a

00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:51.600
software.
It's like programs.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.117
It's the various programs you
run on your computer along with

00:05:55.117 --> 00:05:58.693
the various data files that you
have saved on your hard drive,

00:05:58.693 --> 00:06:02.019
and so forth.
And those can be duplicated.

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:03.620
You have copy after copy after
copy.

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.540
You can have two copies of my
personality.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.547
You could have 100 or 1,000.
The problem with--what drove

00:06:11.547 --> 00:06:15.459
the personality theory into the
no branching rule,

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:18.804
implausible as it may be,
was the fact that your

00:06:18.804 --> 00:06:23.519
personality is like software,
and it can be copied.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:27.651
That's why, they say,
we should believe in the body

00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:30.726
view.
If we accept the body view,

00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:33.870
we avoid the duplication
problem.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:38.931
Because, unlike software,
which can be literally copied,

00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:43.899
as many as you want identical,
the body can't split.

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:48.730
Human bodies can't divide or
branch.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.943
There's no way that there's
another body,

00:06:51.943 --> 00:06:55.639
that the body on Thursday
became two bodies.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.883
The body that was here on
Thursday didn't,

00:06:57.883 --> 00:07:01.000
couldn't become two bodies.
So we avoid all the problem.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.892
That's at least the kind of
claim that fans of the body view

00:07:05.892 --> 00:07:10.867
often make in the face of this
difficulty for the personality

00:07:10.867 --> 00:07:13.001
theory.
Well, now we need to ask,

00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:16.811
is it really true?
Is it really true that bodies

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:20.189
don't face a duplication
problem?

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:25.250
Is it really true that human
bodies don't and couldn't split?

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.379
Look, the crucial word here is,
of course, "couldn't."

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:31.116
Personalities don't actually
split either,

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:32.886
right?
Although I've been giving

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:35.358
science fiction examples in
which the mad scientist

00:07:35.358 --> 00:07:37.829
duplicates my memories and
beliefs and desires,

00:07:37.829 --> 00:07:40.540
they've all been science
fiction examples.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.329
If I can use science fiction to
talk about the possibility of

00:07:44.329 --> 00:07:47.930
splitting, and use that against
the personality theory,

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.841
I'm entitled to use science
fiction examples to talk about

00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:54.449
the possibility of bodies
splitting,

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:58.830
and ask, what kind of problem
that would raise for the body

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.912
theory?
Now, we are familiar with some

00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:07.450
low-level examples of bodies
splitting.

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:11.800
Amoebas split, right?
You've got a single amoeba.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.302
It's going along.
At a certain point--Let's draw

00:08:15.302 --> 00:08:17.779
our amoeba splitting,
right?

00:08:17.779 --> 00:08:21.569
You've got an amoeba split,
going along.

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:27.730
At a certain point,
it starts to look like that.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.670
Then it looks like that.
And then boom!

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.920
You've got, well, it splits.

00:08:37.129 --> 00:08:42.240
There's nothing in biology per
se that rules out cell division.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.080
Indeed, on the contrary, right?
We know cells can split.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.504
Now, human bodies,
unlike amoebas,

00:08:48.504 --> 00:08:51.289
don't do that.
But maybe there's nothing in

00:08:51.289 --> 00:08:53.590
biology that rules out the
possibility.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:57.736
Suppose we open up the Yale
Daily tomorrow and we see

00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:02.087
that the Yale Center for Amoebic
Studies has made this tremendous

00:09:02.087 --> 00:09:05.009
breakthrough and has discovered
how to,

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:09.195
through the right kind of
injection or whatever,

00:09:09.195 --> 00:09:14.361
cause a human body to replicate
and split in an amoeba-like

00:09:14.361 --> 00:09:17.640
fashion.
Well, then we have to face the

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.840
problem of what to say in this
case of bodily branching.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.610
Well, instead of pursuing that
example, let me give you a

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.479
slightly different example
that's been discussed a fair bit

00:09:27.479 --> 00:09:29.260
in the philosophical literature.

00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:37.269
This is actually a case that
one of the students in the class

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:40.720
asked about, I think it was last
week, if it wasn't even earlier.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.259
And I said, "Great question.
Let's come back to it."

00:09:43.259 --> 00:09:46.312
So here, at long last,
I'm making good on my

00:09:46.312 --> 00:09:49.686
promissory note.
I'm going to come back to the

00:09:49.686 --> 00:09:53.488
example that was raised before.
You'll recall that when we

00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:56.753
talked about the body view,
I said the best version of the

00:09:56.753 --> 00:09:59.330
body view doesn't require the
entire body,

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:02.860
to be the same body,
but the brain.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:05.975
Follow the brain.
And indeed, it doesn't seem as

00:10:05.975 --> 00:10:08.179
though we have to require the
entire brain,

00:10:08.179 --> 00:10:11.410
just enough of the brain,
however much that turns out,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.240
to house personality,
memories and so forth.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.559
And then, I said,
suppose it was possible that

00:10:20.559 --> 00:10:23.120
one hemisphere of your brain is
enough.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.746
If there's enough redundancy in
the brain so that even if your

00:10:27.746 --> 00:10:31.109
right hemisphere got destroyed,
your left hemisphere,

00:10:31.109 --> 00:10:32.950
you still have all the same
memories, desires,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.029
beliefs.
Good enough.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:38.169
So now we worry about the
following case.

00:10:38.169 --> 00:10:40.683
So I gave you a bunch of
examples, right,

00:10:40.683 --> 00:10:44.138
where there are brains being
transplanted into torsos of

00:10:44.138 --> 00:10:47.482
others.
So suppose, gruesome as it was,

00:10:47.482 --> 00:10:52.102
this weekend I'm in some
horrible accident and my torso

00:10:52.102 --> 00:10:56.980
gets destroyed and they keep my
brain on life support,

00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:02.915
oxygenating it just long enough
to do some radical surgery into

00:11:02.915 --> 00:11:06.090
some spare torsos.
Where'd the torsos come from?

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.389
Well, you had some living
people, but they had very rare

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:12.509
brain diseases and their brain
suddenly liquefied.

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:13.580
So now we've got some spare
torsos.

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:26.880
All right, so here we've got
Shelly Kagan.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.710
His body gets destroyed.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:32.300
And here's my brain.

00:11:36.909 --> 00:11:42.120
Over here we've got Jones'
torso.

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:48.950
And over here we've got Smith's
torso.

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:04.687
Suppose we take,
call this one the left

00:12:04.687 --> 00:12:15.169
hemisphere, and we stick it in
here, into Jones' torso.

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:19.544
We take this other hemisphere,
the right half of my brain and

00:12:19.544 --> 00:12:21.950
we stick it into Smith's torso.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:28.649
We connect all the wires,
all the neurons.

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:31.310
The operation's a smashing
success.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.410
Both things wake up.

00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:43.679
So here's Jones' torso with the
left half of SK's brain.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:46.530
Smith's torso with the right
half of SK's brain.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.369
They wake up.
We need some way to refer to

00:12:53.369 --> 00:12:55.078
these people,
so we can start talking about

00:12:55.078 --> 00:12:57.470
who they are.
Let me just call this top

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.161
one--Jones' torso with the left
half of Shelly Kagan's

00:13:01.161 --> 00:13:03.320
brain--let's call him Lefty.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:08.982
Smith's torso with the right
half of Shelly Kagan's brain,

00:13:08.982 --> 00:13:10.040
let's call him Righty.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:21.500
Okay, operation's a success.
Lefty and Righty both wake up.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:26.309
They both think they're Shelly
Kagan, and so forth and so on.

00:13:26.309 --> 00:13:31.470
And we ask ourselves,
according to the body view,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:36.090
which one is Shelly Kagan?
What are the possibilities?

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:41.800
We could say Lefty is Shelly
Kagan and Righty is not.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.707
Righty's an imposter.
But there's nothing in the body

00:13:46.707 --> 00:13:50.159
view to give us a reason to make
that choice.

00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:53.926
It's true that Lefty's got half
of Shelly Kagan's brain and

00:13:53.926 --> 00:13:57.036
that's good enough.
But it's also true that

00:13:57.036 --> 00:14:01.211
Righty's got half of Shelly
Kagan's brain and that seems

00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:03.947
good enough.
So there's no reason to say

00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:06.610
that Lefty is Shelly Kagan and
Righty isn't.

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.723
And similarly,
of course, there's nothing in

00:14:08.723 --> 00:14:11.623
the body view to make us say
that Righty is Shelly Kagan and

00:14:11.623 --> 00:14:12.410
Lefty isn't.

00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:17.564
Well, if it's not one,
and not the other,

00:14:17.564 --> 00:14:19.080
what are the remaining
possibilities?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.926
We could, I suppose,
try to say they're both

00:14:23.926 --> 00:14:27.001
Shelly Kagan.
And so Shelly Kagan continues,

00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:29.812
that is to say his body
continues, that is to say his

00:14:29.812 --> 00:14:32.726
brain continues,
that is to say enough of his

00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:35.083
brain continues,
merrily on its way,

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:39.028
except now in two places.
And so from now on,

00:14:39.028 --> 00:14:42.496
Shelly Kagan,
that single person,

00:14:42.496 --> 00:14:47.590
is in two different places at
the same time.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:53.519
Lefty goes to California.
Righty moves to Vermont.

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:55.590
From now on,
Shelly Kagan's bicoastal.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.249
It doesn't seem right.
So what else can the body

00:15:02.249 --> 00:15:04.540
theory say?
Well, the body theory could say

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.789
neither of them are
Shelly Kagan.

00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:12.700
Shelly Kagan died in that
gruesome, horrible accident.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.521
Although it's true that we now
have two people,

00:15:15.521 --> 00:15:18.465
Lefty and Righty,
each of whom has half of Shelly

00:15:18.465 --> 00:15:20.825
Kagan's brain,
and all of Shelly Kagan's

00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:23.888
memories, for whatever that's
worth, neither of them is Shelly

00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:27.000
Kagan.
We could say that as well.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.844
But if we--and that seems the
least unpalatable of the

00:15:29.844 --> 00:15:32.206
alternatives.
But if we say that,

00:15:32.206 --> 00:15:35.320
then we've given up on the body
view.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:39.100
Because the body view,
after all, said to be Shelly

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.879
Kagan is to have enough of
Shelly Kagan's brain.

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:45.602
And in this case,
both of Lefty and Righty seem

00:15:45.602 --> 00:15:48.030
to have enough of Shelly Kagan's
brain.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.902
What's the body theorist to do?
As far as I can see,

00:15:55.902 --> 00:16:00.473
the best option for the body
theorist at this point is to

00:16:00.473 --> 00:16:04.309
add--no surprises here--a no
branching rule.

00:16:04.309 --> 00:16:08.687
The body theorist should say,
"The key to personal identity

00:16:08.687 --> 00:16:12.182
is having the same body,
to wit, the same brain,

00:16:12.182 --> 00:16:15.512
to wit, enough of the brain to
keep the personality

00:16:15.512 --> 00:16:18.509
going--provided that there's no
branching,

00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:22.957
no splitting,
no perfect competitors,

00:16:22.957 --> 00:16:26.714
only one."
If the body view adds the no

00:16:26.714 --> 00:16:29.638
branching principle,
then we can say,

00:16:29.638 --> 00:16:34.431
look, in the case of this sort
of splitting--This example is

00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:38.980
known in theto philosophical
literature as fission,

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:42.039
like nuclear fission when a big
atom splits into two.

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:44.762
So, in the fission case,
the body says,

00:16:44.762 --> 00:16:47.842
the body theorist says,
in the fission case,

00:16:47.842 --> 00:16:50.779
there's splitting,
there's branching.

00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:54.750
So neither of them is going to
end up being Shelly Kagan.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.912
But in the ordinary humdrum
case, here I am,

00:16:58.912 --> 00:17:01.200
my body.
Why am I Shelly Kagan?

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:04.360
Because the brain in front of
you--you can't see it,

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.893
but it's in front of you--the
brain in front of you is the

00:17:07.893 --> 00:17:11.550
very same brain as the brain
that you had in front of you on

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:13.233
Thursday.
Follow the body,

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:17.165
in particular follow the brain.
So in the ordinary case,

00:17:17.165 --> 00:17:20.400
no splitting,
follow the brain.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.929
In the special case where
there's splitting,

00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:27.869
even if you follow the brain,
not good enough.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:33.558
So the body theorist can avoid
the problem of fission,

00:17:33.558 --> 00:17:38.710
avoid the problem of
duplication by adding the no

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:42.261
branching rule.
But of course,

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:47.660
the no branching rule didn't
seem very intuitive.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.126
Whether or not I'm Shelly
Kagan, the guy that was

00:17:50.126 --> 00:17:52.826
lecturing to you on Thursday,
depends on whether,

00:17:52.826 --> 00:17:54.865
unbeknownst to me,
over the weekend,

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:57.019
somebody removed half of my
brain,

00:17:57.019 --> 00:17:59.630
stuck it in some other torso,
sealed me all back up.

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.830
How could that matter?

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.456
Well, if you don't find the no
branching rule plausible,

00:18:13.456 --> 00:18:16.509
you're in trouble as a body
theorist.

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:20.981
In fact, so what we see is,
the body theory is in exactly

00:18:20.981 --> 00:18:24.494
the same problem,
exactly the same situation,

00:18:24.494 --> 00:18:29.491
as the personality theory.
Indeed, the fission example is

00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:34.261
a very nice case of how you
could have splitting for the

00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:37.690
personality theory.
Here, before the accident,

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.323
was Shelly Kagan,
somebody who had my beliefs,

00:18:40.323 --> 00:18:42.779
desires, memories,
goals, and so forth.

00:18:42.779 --> 00:18:46.006
After the accident,
we've got two people,

00:18:46.006 --> 00:18:48.910
Lefty and Righty,
or two entities,

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.284
Lefty and Righty,
both of whom have Shelly

00:18:52.284 --> 00:18:55.330
Kagan's memories,
beliefs, desires,

00:18:55.330 --> 00:19:00.241
goals, and so forth.
Splitting the brain shows how

00:19:00.241 --> 00:19:04.059
you could, in fact,
have splitting of personality.

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:09.180
So the very same case raises
the very same problem for both

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.799
the body view and the
personality view.

00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:16.100
And the only solution that I
can see, at least the best

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.339
solution that I can see,
is to accept the no branching

00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:21.671
rule.
If you don't like the no

00:19:21.671 --> 00:19:24.565
branching rule,
it's not clear what your

00:19:24.565 --> 00:19:26.571
alternatives are.
Or at least,

00:19:26.571 --> 00:19:28.309
it is clear what your
alternatives are;

00:19:28.309 --> 00:19:32.039
it's not clear which
alternative would be any better.

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:35.848
Now during all of
this--problems for the

00:19:35.848 --> 00:19:39.754
personality theory,
problems for the body

00:19:39.754 --> 00:19:45.027
view--during all of this,
the soul theorist is having a

00:19:45.027 --> 00:19:48.899
field day.
The soul theorist is saying,

00:19:48.899 --> 00:19:52.528
"Look you guys,
you got into all this trouble

00:19:52.528 --> 00:19:55.910
with splitting and so forth and
so on,

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.756
and needing to add the no
branching rule,

00:19:58.756 --> 00:20:01.460
silly and implausible as that
seems,

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.924
you got into all that trouble
because of the problem of

00:20:03.924 --> 00:20:06.070
splitting because personalities
can be split,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:09.525
bodies can be split.
If only you had seen the light

00:20:09.525 --> 00:20:13.569
and stuck to the soul theory of
personal identity,

00:20:13.569 --> 00:20:16.869
all these problems could be
avoided."

00:20:16.869 --> 00:20:20.730
Now, as you know,
I don't believe in souls.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.690
But forget that issue for the
moment.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:26.110
Let's just ask the question,
"Is it true that the soul

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.789
theory--if only there were
souls--is it true that the soul

00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:33.339
theory would at least have the
following advantage?

00:20:33.339 --> 00:20:38.800
It avoids these problems of
duplication and fission."

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.289
Well let's ask.
What should a soul theorist say

00:20:44.289 --> 00:20:50.330
about the fission case?
So here's the gruesome accident.

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:56.596
My brain gets split apart.
One part gets put into Jones'

00:20:56.596 --> 00:20:59.985
torso.
One part gets put into Smith's

00:20:59.985 --> 00:21:02.062
torso.
After the operation,

00:21:02.062 --> 00:21:05.119
Lefty wakes up thinking he's
Shelly Kagan.

00:21:05.119 --> 00:21:07.640
Smith wakes up thinking he's
Shelly Kagan.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.980
Lefty's got part of Shelly
Kagan's brain.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.130
Smith's, or rather Righty's got
part of Shelly Kagan's brain.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:20.589
What should the soul theorist
say about the case of fission?

00:21:20.589 --> 00:21:23.766
Well, again,
remember, the soul theory says

00:21:23.766 --> 00:21:27.849
the key to being the same person
is having the soul.

00:21:27.849 --> 00:21:31.160
Why am I the person that was
lecturing to you on Thursday?

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:35.144
Because it's the very same soul
animating my body,

00:21:35.144 --> 00:21:40.987
or what have you.
So, what does the soul theorist

00:21:40.987 --> 00:21:46.578
say about the fission case?
I'm not quite sure,

00:21:46.578 --> 00:21:51.973
because we have to turn to a
metaphysical question that we've

00:21:51.973 --> 00:21:56.289
touched upon before,
namely, can souls split?

00:21:56.289 --> 00:21:59.513
After all, the problem that
fission raises for the

00:21:59.513 --> 00:22:01.683
personality theory,
in a nutshell,

00:22:01.683 --> 00:22:05.170
is that personalities can
split, they can branch.

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.549
The problem for the body view
that fission raises,

00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:09.590
in a nutshell,
is that bodies can split.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:14.270
They can branch.
We need to ask about the

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:19.119
metaphysics of the soul,
can souls split?

00:22:19.119 --> 00:22:21.430
And I don't know the answer to
that, of course.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.950
So let's consider both
possibilities.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.685
Possibility number one.
Souls, just like bodies,

00:22:26.685 --> 00:22:28.600
just like personalities,
can split.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.290
Suppose that's what happened.
So, there was a single soul

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.615
here, Shelly Kagan's soul,
but in the middle of this

00:22:38.615 --> 00:22:42.378
gruesome operation,
gruesome accident and followed

00:22:42.378 --> 00:22:46.569
by this amazing operation,
Shelly Kagan's soul split.

00:22:46.569 --> 00:22:53.953
So there's one of the SK souls
over here and there's one of the

00:22:53.953 --> 00:22:58.359
SK souls in the other case as
well.

00:22:58.359 --> 00:23:05.175
Each one of Lefty and Righty
has one of the pieces of the

00:23:05.175 --> 00:23:10.152
split Shelly Kagan soul.
All right, so now we ask

00:23:10.152 --> 00:23:14.684
ourselves, "According to the
soul theory, which one is Shelly

00:23:14.684 --> 00:23:16.743
Kagan?"
Well, you--By this point,

00:23:16.743 --> 00:23:19.350
you can run through all the
possibilities yourself,

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.201
right?
We could say,

00:23:21.201 --> 00:23:24.710
well, it's Lefty and not
Righty.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.089
But there's nothing in the soul
theory that supports that claim.

00:23:28.089 --> 00:23:31.501
They each have an equally
good--however good it may

00:23:31.501 --> 00:23:35.526
be--they've got an equally good
piece of the original Shelly

00:23:35.526 --> 00:23:38.158
Kagan soul.
So there's no reason to say

00:23:38.158 --> 00:23:40.839
that Lefty is Shelly Kagan and
Righty isn't.

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:44.774
There's no good reason to say
Righty is Shelly Kagan and Lefty

00:23:44.774 --> 00:23:46.876
isn't.
Well, would it be better to say

00:23:46.876 --> 00:23:49.742
they're both Shelly
Kagan, as long as you've got a

00:23:49.742 --> 00:23:53.016
piece of Shelly Kagan's soul,
of the original soul,

00:23:53.016 --> 00:23:56.797
then you just are Shelly Kagan?
In which case,

00:23:56.797 --> 00:24:00.293
Lefty and Righty are both
Shelly Kagan,

00:24:00.293 --> 00:24:05.076
and Shelly Kagan is now
bicoastal, one in California,

00:24:05.076 --> 00:24:08.480
one in Vermont,
one part of him?

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.600
That doesn't seem very
satisfying.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:13.510
What's the alternative?
The alternative,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.900
it seems, for the soul
theorist, is to say,

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.290
neither of them is
Shelly Kagan.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.190
Neither of them is Shelly
Kagan, then Shelly Kagan died.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:28.410
But how can we say that if we
accept the soul theory?

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.660
They both have pieces of Shelly
Kagan's soul.

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:36.507
The soul split.
Well, maybe what the soul

00:24:36.507 --> 00:24:40.648
theorist would have to do at
this point is accept

00:24:40.648 --> 00:24:44.099
the--da-ta-da--the no branching
rule.

00:24:44.099 --> 00:24:47.769
"Ah," says the soul theorist,
"Follow the soul--unless the

00:24:47.769 --> 00:24:51.051
soul splits, in which case
neither of them is Shelly

00:24:51.051 --> 00:24:51.760
Kagan."

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:00.427
Well, the trouble is,
we didn't find the no branching

00:25:00.427 --> 00:25:04.819
rule very plausible.
It seemed counterintuitive.

00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:07.719
But at this point,
you begin to wonder,

00:25:07.719 --> 00:25:11.230
maybe we just need to learn to
live with it.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.703
If the personality theory needs
the no branching rule,

00:25:14.703 --> 00:25:17.980
and the body theory needs the
no branching rule,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.820
and the soul theory needs the
no branching rule,

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.070
maybe we're just stuck with the
no branching rule,

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:30.363
whether or not we like it.
And if we're stuck with it,

00:25:30.363 --> 00:25:33.764
then of course it's not an
objection against any one of the

00:25:33.764 --> 00:25:37.139
theories that uses it.
Well, this is all what we would

00:25:37.139 --> 00:25:40.279
say as soul theorists if we
think souls can split.

00:25:40.279 --> 00:25:44.688
But we need to consider the
possibility that souls can't

00:25:44.688 --> 00:25:47.835
split.
Maybe the soul theorist has an

00:25:47.835 --> 00:25:52.678
alternative available to it
that--available to him that the

00:25:52.678 --> 00:25:59.597
other theories don't have.
Suppose Shelly Kagan's soul

00:25:59.597 --> 00:26:03.420
cannot split.
What does that mean?

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:10.277
It means, when my brain gets
split, my soul is going to end

00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:15.480
up in Lefty or in Righty,
but not in both.

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.956
If a soul can't split,
you can't end up with pieces of

00:26:18.956 --> 00:26:22.039
the soul or the remnants of the
soul in both.

00:26:22.039 --> 00:26:23.920
The soul is a unified simple
thing.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.891
Now, I don't actually know
whether it's true that simple

00:26:28.891 --> 00:26:31.320
things can't split.
Metaphysically,

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.089
I'm not sure whether that's a
possibility or not.

00:26:33.089 --> 00:26:37.427
But let's just suppose--look,
Plato argued the soul was

00:26:37.427 --> 00:26:39.797
simple.
He didn't actually convince me

00:26:39.797 --> 00:26:42.433
of that, but suppose we thought
souls are simple,

00:26:42.433 --> 00:26:44.740
and we think simple things
can't split.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.089
It would follow,
then, that souls can't split.

00:26:47.089 --> 00:26:49.599
Suppose we accept all that
metaphysics.

00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:53.059
Then the question is just,
which one is Shelly Kagan?

00:26:53.059 --> 00:26:58.769
Well, it depends which one
ended up with Shelly Kagan's

00:26:58.769 --> 00:27:00.458
soul.
We can't say,

00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:04.753
they both have a piece.
One of them will have it,

00:27:04.753 --> 00:27:08.178
the other one won't.
And you want to know which

00:27:08.178 --> 00:27:11.948
one's Shelly Kagan?
The one that actually ends up

00:27:11.948 --> 00:27:16.761
with Shelly Kagan's soul.
If Lefty ends up with Shelly

00:27:16.761 --> 00:27:20.327
Kagan's soul,
then Lefty is Shelly Kagan and

00:27:20.327 --> 00:27:23.909
Righty is an imposter.
He thinks he's Shelly Kagan,

00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:26.227
but he's not,
because he doesn't have Shelly

00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:29.599
Kagan's soul.
Lefty has it.

00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:35.206
If Righty's got Shelly Kagan's
soul, then Righty is Shelly

00:27:35.206 --> 00:27:41.777
Kagan and Lefty is the imposter.
Now, looking at the situation

00:27:41.777 --> 00:27:46.563
from the outside,
we might be unable to tell

00:27:46.563 --> 00:27:50.569
which one is really Shelly
Kagan.

00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:54.563
Because we won't be able to
tell, looking at it from the

00:27:54.563 --> 00:27:58.339
outside, which one really has
Shelly Kagan's soul.

00:27:58.339 --> 00:28:01.379
Although it will be true,
whichever one really does have

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.480
Shelly Kagan's soul is Shelly
Kagan.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.509
But we don't know which one
that is.

00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:10.195
Interestingly,
and somewhat more surprisingly,

00:28:10.195 --> 00:28:14.618
looking at it from the inside,
we won't be able to tell

00:28:14.618 --> 00:28:16.983
either.
Lefty will say,

00:28:16.983 --> 00:28:20.470
"Give me a break.
Of course I'm Shelly Kagan.

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.290
Of course I've got Shelly
Kagan's soul.

00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:28.447
Of course I'm the one."
But Righty will also say,

00:28:28.447 --> 00:28:31.400
"Give me a break.
Of course I'm Shelly Kagan.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.600
Of course I've got Shelly
Kagan's soul.

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:38.386
Of course I'm the one."
If souls can't split,

00:28:38.386 --> 00:28:42.583
one of them is mistaken.
But there's no way for them to

00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:44.410
know which one is the one that's
deceived.

00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:52.345
Now, that may not be a problem
that you're unwilling to

00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:54.407
swallow.
As we've seen,

00:28:54.407 --> 00:28:58.799
all the views here have their
difficulties.

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:03.089
Maybe that's the difficulty
you're prepared to accept.

00:29:03.089 --> 00:29:05.009
What's the right answer in
fission?

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:08.400
It depends on who's got Shelly
Kagan's soul.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.391
No way to tell.
But still, that's the answer to

00:29:11.391 --> 00:29:13.690
the metaphysical question.
Question?

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:15.970
Student: What happens if
neither of these had Shelly

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.401
Kagan's soul?
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:29:18.401 --> 00:29:21.286
The question was,
"What if neither of these have

00:29:21.286 --> 00:29:25.289
Shelly Kagan's soul?"
Then they're both imposters.

00:29:25.289 --> 00:29:28.826
That's a little bit like the
case we worried about when we

00:29:28.826 --> 00:29:31.680
started thinking about the soul
view, right?

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.151
What if last night God
destroyed my soul and put in a

00:29:38.151 --> 00:29:41.509
new soul?
Then Shelly Kagan died.

00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:46.920
If Shelly Kagan's soul does not
migrate to Lefty or Righty,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.863
neither of them is Shelly
Kagan, according to the soul

00:29:51.863 --> 00:29:54.339
theory.
What happened to Shelly Kagan?

00:29:54.339 --> 00:29:57.490
Well, if the soul got
destroyed, Shelly Kagan died.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.100
If the soul didn't get
destroyed, maybe somebody else

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.610
that we weren't even looking at
is Shelly Kagan.

00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:11.855
So as I say,
the soul theory can at least

00:30:11.855 --> 00:30:16.019
give us an answer that avoids
the no branching rule.

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:20.483
If souls are simples and
simples can't split,

00:30:20.483 --> 00:30:25.454
there's no possibility of
having two things with a

00:30:25.454 --> 00:30:29.464
relevant soul.
So we don't need to add,

00:30:29.464 --> 00:30:34.380
in this ad hoc fashion,
the no branching rule.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.169
That's an advantage for the
soul theory, if only we believed

00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:39.750
in souls.
It is an advantage.

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:44.674
But I need to point out that
there's another disadvantage

00:30:44.674 --> 00:30:49.160
that the fission case raises for
the soul theory.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:55.423
So let's just suppose that
metaphysically God tells us that

00:30:55.423 --> 00:30:59.960
it's Lefty that has Shelly
Kagan's soul.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.640
Then of course it's Lefty that
is Shelly Kagan.

00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:07.302
Righty is an imposter.
Righty believes he's Shelly

00:31:07.302 --> 00:31:10.646
Kagan, he has all the memories
of Shelly Kagan,

00:31:10.646 --> 00:31:13.190
all the desires of Shelly
Kagan,

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.633
but he's not Shelly Kagan
because he doesn't have Shelly

00:31:15.633 --> 00:31:20.640
Kagan's soul.
Lefty happens to have it.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.147
That's a nice answer to the
problem of fission,

00:31:24.147 --> 00:31:28.111
but notice the problem it
raises for the argument for

00:31:28.111 --> 00:31:31.390
believing in a soul in the first
place.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:34.134
Way back at the start of the
semester when we asked,

00:31:34.134 --> 00:31:37.965
"Why believe in souls?"
one important argument was,

00:31:37.965 --> 00:31:43.120
or really family of arguments
was, you need to believe in

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.000
souls in order to explain why
bodies are animated,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.474
why people are rational,
how they can have

00:31:50.474 --> 00:31:53.010
personalities,
how they can be creative,

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.397
and so forth.
In order to explain

00:31:56.397 --> 00:31:58.039
consciousness and
self-awareness.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:01.746
Whatever it was,
fill in your favorite blank,

00:32:01.746 --> 00:32:05.200
fill in the blank in your
favorite way.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:08.802
The claim was,
you needed to believe in souls

00:32:08.802 --> 00:32:12.728
in order to explain all that.
But if that's right,

00:32:12.728 --> 00:32:15.090
what's going on in Righty's
case?

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.160
Righty is aware.
Righty is conscious.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.400
Righty is creative.
Righty has free will.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:25.340
Righty makes plans.
Righty's got personality.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:30.019
Righty is rational.
Righty's body is animated.

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:32.994
According to the soul-theory
argument for soul,

00:32:32.994 --> 00:32:35.970
rather, according to the
argument for souls,

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:41.338
you needed to believe in souls
in order to explain how you

00:32:41.338 --> 00:32:45.346
could have a person.
But now Righty's a person

00:32:45.346 --> 00:32:48.755
without a soul,
because we just hypothesized,

00:32:48.755 --> 00:32:51.700
oh, Shelly Kagan's soul's up
there.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:56.767
So at the very same moment that
positing the nonsplitting of

00:32:56.767 --> 00:33:01.750
souls seems to solve the fission
problem of duplication,

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:06.218
it yanks the rug out from
underneath the soul theorist by

00:33:06.218 --> 00:33:11.085
undermining one of the types of
arguments for believing in the

00:33:11.085 --> 00:33:16.146
soul in the first place.
After all, if Righty can be a

00:33:16.146 --> 00:33:22.190
person, admittedly not Shelly
Kagan, but a person--conscious,

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.603
creative, rational,
so forth, aware--without a

00:33:26.603 --> 00:33:31.410
soul, then maybe the same thing
is true for us,

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:34.980
which is of course what the
physicalist says.

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:38.029
Let me mention one other
possibility, because it's quite

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:41.210
intriguing.
Suppose the soul theorist

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:46.917
answers that last objection by
saying, "Ain't ever going to

00:33:46.917 --> 00:33:50.348
happen."
Yeah, it would be a problem for

00:33:50.348 --> 00:33:54.589
believing in souls if Righty
could wake up without one.

00:33:54.589 --> 00:33:59.017
But since we stipulated that
Shelly Kagan's soul is going to

00:33:59.017 --> 00:34:02.769
end up in Lefty,
Righty is not going to wake up.

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:06.816
Alternatively,
it might have been that Righty

00:34:06.816 --> 00:34:11.782
woke up, but Lefty doesn't wake
up, doesn't survive the

00:34:11.782 --> 00:34:14.975
operation.
Suppose we did these sort of

00:34:14.975 --> 00:34:18.923
brain transfers all the time and
the following thing always

00:34:18.923 --> 00:34:21.684
happened.
Transfer the entire brain,

00:34:21.684 --> 00:34:25.599
the patient wakes up.
Transfer one hemisphere,

00:34:25.599 --> 00:34:30.745
the patient wakes up.
Transfer both hemispheres,

00:34:30.745 --> 00:34:36.760
one patient or the other wakes
up, but never both.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.728
If that happened,
we'd have a great new argument

00:34:41.728 --> 00:34:46.775
for the existence of a soul.
What could possibly explain why

00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:50.101
either hemisphere of the brain
would normally be enough,

00:34:50.101 --> 00:34:52.340
as long as we don't transfer
both?

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.553
When we transfer both,
one hemisphere might work

00:34:54.553 --> 00:34:57.380
sometimes, sometimes the other
hemisphere, but never both.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.470
What could possibly explain
that?

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.756
Souls could explain that.
If souls can't split,

00:35:03.756 --> 00:35:07.871
it can only follow one half of
the brain, and that's why we'll

00:35:07.871 --> 00:35:10.300
get somebody that's got one
half,

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.409
sometimes the other half,
but never both halves.

00:35:13.409 --> 00:35:21.411
So there's a kind of empirical
argument for the existence of

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:27.650
the soul if we found those kinds
of results.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.310
Of course, that's a big "if."
Please don't go away thinking

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.435
that what I just said is,
here's a new argument for the

00:35:32.435 --> 00:35:34.819
soul.
We don't do brain transfers,

00:35:34.819 --> 00:35:37.849
let alone have a half-a-brain
transfers.

00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:41.287
We don't have any experiments
that suggest one half wakes up,

00:35:41.287 --> 00:35:44.555
but not the other half.
All I'm saying is that if

00:35:44.555 --> 00:35:47.199
someday we found that,
at that point,

00:35:47.199 --> 00:35:49.990
we'd have an argument for the
soul.

00:35:57.909 --> 00:36:01.539
Well again, let me put away the
soul theory again.

00:36:01.539 --> 00:36:03.752
I was exploring it because it's
interesting to think about its

00:36:03.752 --> 00:36:06.141
implication.
But since I don't believe in

00:36:06.141 --> 00:36:09.635
souls, I want to choose between
the body view and the

00:36:09.635 --> 00:36:12.447
personality view.
Both of them,

00:36:12.447 --> 00:36:18.428
as we saw in the face of
fission, needs to accept a no

00:36:18.428 --> 00:36:22.157
branching rule.
If they're going to survive

00:36:22.157 --> 00:36:25.678
thinking about this case at all,
we need to throw in a no

00:36:25.678 --> 00:36:28.815
branching rule.
Whether or not you find the no

00:36:28.815 --> 00:36:32.759
branching rule hard to believe,
if both views are stuck with

00:36:32.759 --> 00:36:35.300
it, well, then we're stuck with
it.

00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:40.594
So let's try to choose between
the personality theory with the

00:36:40.594 --> 00:36:45.628
no branching rule and the body
theory with the no branching

00:36:45.628 --> 00:36:50.280
rule.
Which of these should we accept?

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:56.330
Which of these is the better
theory of personal identity?

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:02.692
Answer, "I'm not sure."
Over the course of my

00:37:02.692 --> 00:37:07.978
philosophical career,
I have moved back and forth

00:37:07.978 --> 00:37:11.483
between them.
There was certainly a long

00:37:11.483 --> 00:37:15.239
period of time in which I found
the personality theory,

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:19.631
that is, the personality theory
with a no branching rule,

00:37:19.631 --> 00:37:23.159
to be the better and more
plausible theory.

00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:27.985
And it certainly has any number
of advocates on the contemporary

00:37:27.985 --> 00:37:31.577
philosophical scene.
But at other times in my

00:37:31.577 --> 00:37:35.710
philosophical career,
I have found the body theory,

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:38.882
that is to say,
the body theory with the no

00:37:38.882 --> 00:37:41.829
branching rule,
to be the more plausible

00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:45.017
theory.
And it is certainly the case

00:37:45.017 --> 00:37:49.732
that the body theory has its
advocates among contemporary

00:37:49.732 --> 00:37:52.656
philosophers.
For what it's worth--and I

00:37:52.656 --> 00:37:56.232
don't actually think that what
I'm about to say is worth all

00:37:56.232 --> 00:37:59.869
that much--I'm going to share
with you my own pet belief.

00:37:59.869 --> 00:38:05.090
These days I'm inclined to go
with the body theory.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.787
I'm inclined to think that the
key to personal identity is

00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:11.511
having the same body,
as long as there's no

00:38:11.511 --> 00:38:14.559
branching, as long as there's no
splitting.

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:19.216
But it's certainly open to you
to decide that you think no,

00:38:19.216 --> 00:38:23.230
no, the personality theory is
the stronger view.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:26.574
I can't settle the question.
I don't have any more

00:38:26.574 --> 00:38:30.349
philosophical arguments up my
sleeve on this issue.

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:37.760
But I do have another point
that's worth considering.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:43.531
Although I'm inclined to think
that the body theory may be the

00:38:43.531 --> 00:38:48.639
best view about what's the key
to personal identity,

00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:54.150
I'm also inclined to think it
doesn't really matter.

00:38:58.199 --> 00:39:00.530
We've been posing the following
question.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:06.273
We've been asking,
"What does it take for it to be

00:39:06.273 --> 00:39:10.691
true that I survive?"
And it may be that what we

00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:13.736
should conclude is,
whatever the best answer to

00:39:13.736 --> 00:39:17.617
that question is,
it's not the question we should

00:39:17.617 --> 00:39:21.529
really have been thinking about.
We weren't going to be in a

00:39:21.529 --> 00:39:24.215
position to see that until we
went through all the stuff we've

00:39:24.215 --> 00:39:26.329
been going over for the last
couple of weeks.

00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:30.160
But now that we're here,
we're in a position perhaps to

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.423
raise the question,
should we be asking what it

00:39:33.423 --> 00:39:39.013
takes to survive?
Or should we be asking about

00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:45.264
what matters in survival?
Now, in posing this question,

00:39:45.264 --> 00:39:49.134
I'm obviously presupposing that
we can draw a distinction

00:39:49.134 --> 00:39:51.829
between the question,
"Do I survive?

00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:54.516
Is somebody that exists in the
future, whatever,

00:39:54.516 --> 00:39:56.222
me?"
and the question,

00:39:56.222 --> 00:40:00.228
"What was it that I
wanted, when I wanted to

00:40:00.228 --> 00:40:04.750
survive?
What was it that mattered in

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:09.098
ordinary survival?"
And it might be that these

00:40:09.098 --> 00:40:12.298
things can actually come apart.
To see this,

00:40:12.298 --> 00:40:17.190
suppose we start by thinking
again about the soul view.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:20.725
Suppose there are souls.
I don't believe in them,

00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:23.179
but let's imagine.
Suppose there are souls.

00:40:23.179 --> 00:40:27.789
And suppose that souls are the
key to personal identity.

00:40:27.789 --> 00:40:32.010
So somebody is me if they've
got my soul.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.301
Or, to put it more
straightforwardly,

00:40:34.301 --> 00:40:38.119
next week the person that's me
is the person with my soul.

00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:41.000
I survive as long as there's
somebody around with my soul.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.289
A hundred years from now,
am I still around?

00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:46.809
Well, if my soul's still
around, that's me.

00:40:46.809 --> 00:40:48.390
That's what the soul theory
says.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:54.545
And suppose it's the truth.
Now, consider the following

00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:58.224
possibility.
Suppose that people can be

00:40:58.224 --> 00:41:01.056
reincarnated.
That is to say,

00:41:01.056 --> 00:41:04.866
at the death of their body,
their soul takes over,

00:41:04.866 --> 00:41:08.521
animates, inhabits,
gets connected to a new body

00:41:08.521 --> 00:41:11.820
that's being born.
But, unlike the kind of

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:15.694
reincarnation cases that get
talked about in popular culture

00:41:15.694 --> 00:41:19.336
and various religions where,
at least under the right

00:41:19.336 --> 00:41:22.080
circumstances,
you can remember your prior

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.030
lives, let's imagine that when
the soul is reincarnated,

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:33.657
it's scrubbed completely clean,
no traces whatsoever of the

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:37.300
earlier life.
No way to retrieve it.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.845
No karmic similarities of
personality or anything,

00:41:41.845 --> 00:41:45.369
just starts over like a blank
slate.

00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:48.160
Like a blackboard that's been
completely erased,

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.307
we now have the very same
blackboard, and now we start

00:41:51.307 --> 00:41:55.763
writing new things on it.
Imagine that that's the way

00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:59.292
reincarnation worked.
So somebody asks you,

00:41:59.292 --> 00:42:01.960
"Will you still be around in
1,000 years?"

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.859
The answer's going to be,
yes, because my soul will be

00:42:04.859 --> 00:42:07.035
reincarnated.
In 1,000 years there'll be

00:42:07.035 --> 00:42:10.162
somebody that has the very same
soul that's animating my body

00:42:10.162 --> 00:42:12.442
right now.
Of course, that soul won't

00:42:12.442 --> 00:42:15.596
remember being Shelly Kagan.
It won't have any memories of

00:42:15.596 --> 00:42:18.580
its prior life.
It won't be like Shelly Kagan

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:23.195
in any way in terms of Shelly
Kagan's desires or ambitions or

00:42:23.195 --> 00:42:26.586
goals or fears.
It won't be that--We can see

00:42:26.586 --> 00:42:30.814
why that personality emerges
through karmic cause and effect

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:35.400
in any way that are a function
of what I was like in my life.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.639
It'll be Shelly Kagan,
because it's Shelly Kagan's

00:42:39.639 --> 00:42:43.965
soul, but with no overlap of
personality, memories,

00:42:43.965 --> 00:42:49.500
anything.
Then I want to say, who cares?

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:54.323
The fact that I will survive
under those circumstances

00:42:54.323 --> 00:42:58.510
doesn't give me anything that
matters to me.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:02.640
It's no comfort to me to be
told I will survive,

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.947
because after all,
the soul is the key to personal

00:43:06.947 --> 00:43:10.007
identity,
if there's no similar

00:43:10.007 --> 00:43:14.665
personality, no memories,
no beliefs, no retrievable

00:43:14.665 --> 00:43:20.820
memories of past lives.
Then who cares that it's me?

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.446
If you can feel the force of
that thought,

00:43:23.446 --> 00:43:26.969
then you're seeing how the
question "Will I survive?"

00:43:26.969 --> 00:43:31.450
can be separated out from the
question "What matters?"

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:36.445
What do we care about?
Bare survival of my soul,

00:43:36.445 --> 00:43:42.117
even though that is the key to
personal identity--if it

00:43:42.117 --> 00:43:48.420
is--bare survival of my soul
doesn't give me what I want.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:54.203
It's no more comforting or
satisfying than if you said,

00:43:54.203 --> 00:43:58.383
"You know this knucklebone?
After you die,

00:43:58.383 --> 00:44:02.448
we're going to do knucklebone
surgery and implant that

00:44:02.448 --> 00:44:05.440
knucklebone in somebody else's
body.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.539
And that knucklebone is going
to survive."

00:44:07.539 --> 00:44:09.907
And I say, "Oh,
that's very interesting that

00:44:09.907 --> 00:44:13.320
that knucklebone will be around
100 or 1,000 years from now.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:18.937
But who cares?"
And if the knucklebone theory

00:44:18.937 --> 00:44:22.230
of personal identity gets
proposed and somebody said,

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:24.843
"Oh, yes, but you see,
that person now with that

00:44:24.843 --> 00:44:27.679
knucklebone will be you,
because the key to personal

00:44:27.679 --> 00:44:30.460
identity is having the very same
knucklebone."

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:35.440
I say, "All right, so it's me.
Who cares?"

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:42.050
Bare knucklebone survival does
not give me what matters.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:46.375
Now, the knucklebone theory of
personal identity is a very

00:44:46.375 --> 00:44:48.697
stupid theory.
In contrast,

00:44:48.697 --> 00:44:54.329
the soul theory of personal
survival is not a stupid theory.

00:44:54.329 --> 00:45:00.440
But for all that,
it doesn't give me what I want.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.688
When you think about the
possibility of bare survival of

00:45:05.688 --> 00:45:08.742
the scrubbed,
clean, erased soul,

00:45:08.742 --> 00:45:14.659
you see that survival wasn't
really everything you wanted.

00:45:14.659 --> 00:45:18.675
What you wanted--at least what
I want, I invite you to ask

00:45:18.675 --> 00:45:22.831
yourself whether you want the
same thing--what I want is not

00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:25.739
just survival,
but survival with the same

00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:27.000
personality.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.969
So even if the soul theory is
the correct theory of

00:45:33.969 --> 00:45:37.500
personality, it's not enough to
give me what matters.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.699
What matters isn't just
survival.

00:45:39.699 --> 00:45:44.820
It's survival with the same
personality.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.820
Let's consider the body view.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:55.750
Suppose that the body theory of
personal identity is correct.

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:57.889
And to be me,
there's got to be somebody

00:45:57.889 --> 00:46:00.727
there that's got my body.
Let's suppose the brain version

00:46:00.727 --> 00:46:02.260
of the theory is the best
version.

00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:07.579
And so next year,
there's going to be somebody

00:46:07.579 --> 00:46:12.269
that's got my brain.
But let's imagine that the

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:17.430
brain has been scrubbed clean.
All memory traces have been

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:22.079
completely erased.
We're talking complete

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:28.627
irreversible amnesia,
complete erasure of the brain's

00:46:28.627 --> 00:46:32.498
hard drive.
No traces of desires and

00:46:32.498 --> 00:46:36.980
memories and intentions and
beliefs to eventually be

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:41.110
recovered if only we have the
right surgery,

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:42.652
or procedure,
or psychotherapy,

00:46:42.652 --> 00:46:46.079
or what have you.
It's gone.

00:46:46.079 --> 00:46:50.504
Now, that thing that wakes up
after this complete irreversible

00:46:50.504 --> 00:46:54.421
amnesia will no doubt eventually
develop a personality,

00:46:54.421 --> 00:46:56.670
a set of beliefs,
memories.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.333
Nobody knows who it is,
so they call it,

00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:00.040
they find it wandering on the
streets.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.921
They call it John Doe.
John Doe will eventually have a

00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:08.843
bunch of beliefs about how the
world works, make some plans,

00:47:08.843 --> 00:47:12.610
get some memories.
According to the body theory,

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:13.510
that's me.

00:47:17.239 --> 00:47:20.722
And if the body theory is
correct, well by golly,

00:47:20.722 --> 00:47:23.795
it is me.
And all I can say in response

00:47:23.795 --> 00:47:26.620
to that is, it's me,
but who cares?

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:31.434
So what?
I'm not comforted by the

00:47:31.434 --> 00:47:37.297
thought that I will still be
around 50 years from now,

00:47:37.297 --> 00:47:43.269
if the thing that's me doesn't
have my personality.

00:47:43.269 --> 00:47:51.420
Mere bodily survival isn't
enough to give me what I want.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:55.829
I want more than mere bodily
survival.

00:47:55.829 --> 00:48:03.559
I want to survive with the same
personality.

00:48:03.559 --> 00:48:07.520
So even if the body theory of
personal identity is the right

00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:10.810
theory, what I want to say in
response to that is,

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.238
"So what?"
If the really crucial question

00:48:14.238 --> 00:48:19.545
is not "Do I survive," but "Do I
have what I wanted when I wanted

00:48:19.545 --> 00:48:23.727
to survive?"
the answer is the body theory

00:48:23.727 --> 00:48:27.159
doesn't give it.
I don't just want to survive.

00:48:27.159 --> 00:48:32.880
I want to survive with the same
personality.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.301
Should we conclude,
therefore, that the key to the

00:48:38.301 --> 00:48:44.161
important question--namely,
"What matters?"--the answer to

00:48:44.161 --> 00:48:47.078
that question,
should we conclude,

00:48:47.078 --> 00:48:50.936
is, same personality?
That's a question we'll have to

00:48:50.936 --> 00:48:52.202
take up next time.

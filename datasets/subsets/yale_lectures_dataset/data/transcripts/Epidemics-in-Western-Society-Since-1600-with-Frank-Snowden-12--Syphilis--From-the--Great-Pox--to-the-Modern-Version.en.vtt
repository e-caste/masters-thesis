00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.180
Prof: Welcome back.
 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.506
And what I want to do this
morning is to be cognizant of

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:11.575
the fact that you have,
as you all know,

00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:14.250
the hour exam later this week.
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.858
It's in a different format,
and I've written to you about

00:00:17.858 --> 00:00:18.310
that.
 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.214
Because of that,
what I thought would be useful

00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:24.749
to do this morning would be to
have something of a review

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:28.239
session,
in which we make explicit some

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.133
of the ways in which it's useful
to think about epidemic

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.104
diseases,
and in which we go over some of

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:42.280
the terrain that we've covered
thus far in the semester.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.740
At the same time,
I want to talk about--

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.350
introduce a new and important
disease,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.733
which is syphilis,
and provide a bit of background

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:55.910
for the book that you're reading
this week,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.010
which is Allan Brandt's No
Magic Bullet.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.624
And you'll be wanting to know,
well where did syphilis come

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:05.180
from, what's the historical
background?

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.683
So, I'm going to try to
introduce that,

00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:11.177
while going over some of the
issues that we've already

00:01:11.177 --> 00:01:12.099
presented.
 

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:16.595
You'll find a lot that's
already familiar this morning,

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:20.590
as we go back in time,
covering major issues that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.340
we've dealt with.
 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.941
And I hope, at the same time,
to be introducing something

00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:27.549
new, which is syphilis.
 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.592
So, we'll look at the period
we've covered in the course,

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.830
through the lens of syphilis.
 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.620
That's the direction in which
we're headed.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.340
Now, in order to talk about a
variety of epidemic diseases and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.528
their impact,
we ought to have some

00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:51.030
comparative questions that we
make explicit.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.309
That is, what is it that we
need to know about each of the

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:56.379
diseases that we're talking
about?

00:01:56.379 --> 00:02:02.688
What are the crucial aspects
that make it a transformative

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:04.349
force or not?
 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:06.810
What are the historical
variables?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.531
I have a sort of suggestion of
maybe ten major questions that

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:15.859
we ought to be thinking about
with regard to each of the

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.030
diseases that we examine
throughout the semester.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.653
A first one is--these
questions, by the way,

00:02:23.653 --> 00:02:25.340
are not canonical.
 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.566
I don't mean that you shouldn't
be asking other questions as

00:02:28.566 --> 00:02:30.479
well, and indeed I hope you
will.

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.973
But I think we should know at
least the answers to these ten

00:02:34.973 --> 00:02:38.860
questions and then build on that
as a foundation.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.335
The first major question,
for any of the diseases we're

00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:46.464
talking about,
was what's the total mortality

00:02:46.464 --> 00:02:52.229
and morbidity that's caused by
the epidemic in question?

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.280
The mortality,
the total numbers of deaths.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.440
Morbidity, the total number of
cases.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.426
That's an important factor that
needs to be taken into account

00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:08.550
in assessing the impact of the
epidemic.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.503
A second question has to do
with a term we introduced long

00:03:13.503 --> 00:03:17.067
ago, a phrase,
which was the case fatality

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:17.848
rate.
 

00:03:17.848 --> 00:03:21.180
And a related question with
that is,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.258
is there an effective therapy
or means of prevention,

00:03:26.258 --> 00:03:31.681
or instead does a society
experience the disease in

00:03:31.681 --> 00:03:39.500
feeling itself to be helpless,
and physicians feeling the same?

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.010
The case fatality rate is--we
could call it the kill rate of a

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.310
disease, the percentage of cases
that terminate in death.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.071
And we know that,
for example,

00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:58.151
in dealing with plague,
one of the features of it--and

00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:02.896
Asiatic cholera as well--
was a very high case fatality

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:05.354
rate,
of plague, fifty to eighty

00:04:05.354 --> 00:04:08.372
percent,
cholera, something like fifty

00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:09.090
percent.
 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.680
At the other extreme,
when we come to it,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.350
we'll see that influenza has a
very high morbidity,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.769
but quite a low case fatality
rate,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.834
and that's related,
I think, to the impact that

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:29.163
that disease,
influenza, has on society,

00:04:29.163 --> 00:04:35.327
which isn't associated with
such terror as say plague or

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:36.560
cholera.
 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.110
That's an important variable,
the kill rate of the disease.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.781
Another factor,
a third question we need to

00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:50.851
ask, is what's the nature of the
symptoms of the infectious

00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:52.949
disease in question?
 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.420
Are they particularly painful?
 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.079
Are they degrading,
according to the norms of the

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:01.759
time?
 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.797
And we've seen,
for example,

00:05:03.797 --> 00:05:07.872
in dealing with plague and
cholera that a major feature

00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:11.795
about them was that their
symptoms were agonizing and

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:13.230
dehumanizing.
 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.314
Clearly, as we turn to
syphilis, its symptoms also were

00:05:19.314 --> 00:05:24.947
extremely important in the way
that the disease was

00:05:24.947 --> 00:05:26.750
experienced.
 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.697
Tuberculosis,
on the other hand--and we'll be

00:05:29.697 --> 00:05:32.845
looking at that--
was seen, at the time,

00:05:32.845 --> 00:05:36.339
to make its sufferers more
intelligent,

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:40.029
more romantic,
more beautiful in some sense,

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:43.500
at least in the first half of
the nineteenth century.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.497
So, that--what is the nature of
the symptoms,

00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:50.769
is a crucially important
question.

00:05:50.769 --> 00:05:54.261
Another, fourth question,
that I hope you'll bear in mind

00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:58.093
throughout the course,
and in your review for the

00:05:58.093 --> 00:06:02.127
exercise this week,
is the question,

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:07.663
is this disease new,
or is it familiar to the

00:06:07.663 --> 00:06:08.920
population?
 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.528
Familiar diseases tend not to
be so terrifying.

00:06:14.528 --> 00:06:19.437
The population is also likely
to have some degree of immunity

00:06:19.437 --> 00:06:22.769
to the disease,
and the disease is likely,

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:26.920
or may have,
already mutated to become less

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.759
deadly.
 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:31.226
Examples are the so-called
diseases of childhood,

00:06:31.226 --> 00:06:33.899
like chickenpox,
mumps and measles;

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:38.815
normally relatively mild,
but in populations to which

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:43.730
they're newly introduced,
they can be devastating.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:49.283
A fifth question has to do
with, what's the profile of the

00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:51.720
victims of the disease?
 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.360
Is this a disease that's an
affliction of the young and the

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.821
elderly;
that is, experienced as a more

00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:04.346
normal course of a disease,
in accord with society's

00:07:04.346 --> 00:07:07.540
expectations and past
experience?

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.798
Or does it instead strike down
particularly those who are in

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:16.999
the prime of life,
thereby no longer seeming

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:22.122
natural but as something
extraordinary in the experience

00:07:22.122 --> 00:07:24.079
of the population?
 

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:30.997
And it also means that the
disease is likely to maximize

00:07:30.997 --> 00:07:37.538
its economic and financial
impact, to be particularly

00:07:37.538 --> 00:07:41.690
destabilizing to a community.
 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.379
Cholera, in this regard,
for example,

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:50.204
was terrifying because of the
way in which it seemed to

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:55.923
afflict those who were the
bulwarks of families and of

00:07:55.923 --> 00:07:57.649
communities.
 

00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:03.726
A sixth question that's
important: what's the class

00:08:03.726 --> 00:08:07.009
profile of the sufferers?
 

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:12.281
What sorts of people in society
are stricken with the

00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:13.600
affliction?
 

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:19.632
Is this a disease of poverty,
such as cholera is usually

00:08:19.632 --> 00:08:21.060
thought of?
 

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.973
Or is it an affliction that
strikes everyone,

00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:32.561
without particular reference to
class or social and economic

00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:37.808
status, like influenza or
syphilis, indeed?

00:08:37.808 --> 00:08:44.384
A seventh important question is
what is the mode of transmission

00:08:44.384 --> 00:08:46.158
of the disease?
 

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:49.918
Is it transmitted person to
person?

00:08:49.918 --> 00:08:54.840
Is it transmitted by
contaminated food and water?

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.428
Are vectors involved?
 

00:08:57.428 --> 00:09:00.860
Is it spread through the air by
droplets?

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.820
Is it spread by sexual contact?
 

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.321
And clearly,
I think we'll be arguing that

00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:12.250
the mode of transmission is
really crucial,

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:17.346
and in sexually transmitted
diseases I think that that is

00:09:17.346 --> 00:09:22.808
fairly self-evident and a very
important factor in the social

00:09:22.808 --> 00:09:25.450
impact of those diseases.
 

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:33.106
An eighth important question is
whether the disease is fulminant

00:09:33.106 --> 00:09:37.969
in its course,
or is it slow acting and a

00:09:37.969 --> 00:09:40.399
wasting disease?
 

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:44.125
If we look, for example,
at cholera, one of the

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:48.904
features, and a striking one,
is that it was one of the most

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:51.009
fulminant of diseases.
 

00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:55.625
It would strike down a
sufferer, and you could board a

00:09:55.625 --> 00:10:00.240
train and die before you reached
your destination,

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.495
as the disease ran its course
that quickly through the human

00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:06.120
body.
 

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.438
Or, on the other hand,
is the disease one that takes

00:10:10.438 --> 00:10:14.590
years, perhaps even decades,
to run its course?

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:19.307
And an example of that,
of course, would be

00:10:19.307 --> 00:10:24.250
tuberculosis or HIV-AIDS,
in our own time.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:30.240
A ninth important question we
need always to bear in mind is

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.928
how is the disease understood by
the population that it's

00:10:35.928 --> 00:10:37.350
infecting?
 

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.798
Is it seen as a punishment of
God?

00:10:40.798 --> 00:10:46.573
Is it later on thought to be
something that comes from the

00:10:46.573 --> 00:10:48.600
dangerous classes?
 

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.802
Or later on,
is it understood to be a

00:10:51.802 --> 00:10:53.759
microbial infection?
 

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:59.063
And those ways in which the
disease is understood have

00:10:59.063 --> 00:11:04.067
enormous impact on how the
population reacts to the

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:05.269
disease.
 

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:12.788
A tenth variable is what's the
duration of the epidemic?

00:11:12.788 --> 00:11:18.076
Influenza, for example,
passes through a locality in a

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:20.870
matter of weeks,
normally.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:28.908
Cholera or plague tend to have
epidemics that last for months.

00:11:28.908 --> 00:11:33.470
And tuberculosis,
one might describe as an

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:40.144
epidemic in slow motion that
afflicts a community for a whole

00:11:40.144 --> 00:11:42.370
century or more.
 

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.552
So, those are ten major
questions that I hope that

00:11:45.552 --> 00:11:48.798
you'll be bearing in mind
throughout the course.

00:11:48.798 --> 00:11:52.687
I think they'll help you in
dealing with the diseases in a

00:11:52.687 --> 00:11:56.621
comparative manner,
and finding out and teasing out

00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:00.309
why some diseases have an impact
of one kind,

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:04.070
and others are very different.
 

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:10.573
Well, this morning I'd like to
go through some of this material

00:12:10.573 --> 00:12:16.028
again, in a review manner,
by looking at syphilis.

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:19.639
Why syphilis at this stage of
the course?

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:24.568
I think that it provides
background for No Magic

00:12:24.568 --> 00:12:28.352
Bullet,
and it also helps us to look at

00:12:28.352 --> 00:12:32.230
some of the material that we've
already covered,

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:37.509
and that you'll be writing
about in the next few days.

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:41.249
Well, first let's deal then
with the chronology,

00:12:41.249 --> 00:12:45.784
and this helps us to step back
in time from the nineteenth

00:12:45.784 --> 00:12:49.604
century;
to go back, indeed,

00:12:49.604 --> 00:12:52.769
to the plague years.
 

00:12:52.769 --> 00:12:58.538
Syphilis, in fact,
was contemporary in its onset

00:12:58.538 --> 00:13:01.714
with plague,
and like plague,

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:05.802
at the time it was a new
disease that first struck

00:13:05.802 --> 00:13:11.970
Europe,
in this case, in the late 1490s.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:16.861
And we'll see that there's an
important Darwinian evolution

00:13:16.861 --> 00:13:20.616
that takes place,
which is to say that the

00:13:20.616 --> 00:13:25.525
syphilis of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries is quite

00:13:25.525 --> 00:13:28.798
different from syphilis
thereafter.

00:13:28.798 --> 00:13:34.998
Syphilis in its first century
or so was what we might call the

00:13:34.998 --> 00:13:40.077
"Great Pox,"
a disease that was much more

00:13:40.077 --> 00:13:43.330
severe than modern syphilis.
 

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:49.855
So, syphilis clearly begins as
a dreadful epidemic that swept

00:13:49.855 --> 00:13:52.899
Europe and then the world.
 

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:58.505
After the sixteenth century,
it's still a very serious

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:05.168
illness, but it's much milder,
less fatal and less agonizing.

00:14:05.168 --> 00:14:11.437
Today we're going to deal
primarily with the early

00:14:11.437 --> 00:14:16.808
syphilis, the syphilis of the
Great Pox.

00:14:16.808 --> 00:14:21.216
Now, the mode of transmission
is clearly important,

00:14:21.216 --> 00:14:26.769
and we need to examine what are
the particular features of STDs,

00:14:26.769 --> 00:14:30.028
of sexually transmitted
diseases.

00:14:30.028 --> 00:14:35.379
Among the venereal diseases--to
use an older term--

00:14:35.379 --> 00:14:41.024
syphilis was king from the
fifteenth century until the late

00:14:41.024 --> 00:14:44.226
twentieth,
when there was the appearance

00:14:44.226 --> 00:14:46.899
of a much more threatening
competitor,

00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:49.860
HIV/AIDS.
 

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.756
And in more recent times,
after World War II and the

00:14:54.756 --> 00:14:58.788
introduction of the era of
antibiotics--

00:14:58.788 --> 00:15:03.700
particularly penicillin--and
sex education,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:08.269
there's been a radical decline
in the incidence of syphilis.

00:15:08.269 --> 00:15:12.611
And for a time there were even
heady hopes that it could be

00:15:12.611 --> 00:15:14.408
eradicated altogether.
 

00:15:14.408 --> 00:15:17.144
But most recently,
unfortunately,

00:15:17.144 --> 00:15:20.220
it's made something of a
comeback.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:24.450
Now, keep in mind,
too, that historically the STDs

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:28.940
weren't carefully distinguished,
one from another.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.322
Until late in the nineteenth
century, other significant

00:15:33.322 --> 00:15:38.110
STDs--gonorrhea and chancre,
in particular--weren't known to

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.139
be separate diseases.
 

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:44.259
They were thought to be simply
milder manifestations of

00:15:44.259 --> 00:15:45.100
syphilis.
 

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.221
So, there was,
we might say,

00:15:47.221 --> 00:15:50.678
a unicity theory of the
venereal diseases;

00:15:50.678 --> 00:15:54.610
there was thought to be one
disease.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:59.220
A reason for dealing with
syphilis now,

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:03.554
at this point in the course,
is that it had a significant

00:16:03.554 --> 00:16:08.001
impact on medical science,
in ways that we've already

00:16:08.001 --> 00:16:11.730
touched upon with regard to
bubonic plague.

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:14.303
That is to say,
like plague,

00:16:14.303 --> 00:16:18.500
syphilis seemed clearly to be
contagious,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.129
and it was understood,
from the beginning,

00:16:22.129 --> 00:16:25.500
to be spread somehow--no one
quite knew how--

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.418
through sexual contact.
 

00:16:28.418 --> 00:16:33.352
And, so, like plague,
syphilis challenged the

00:16:33.352 --> 00:16:37.389
reigning orthodoxy of
humoralism,

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:40.610
and gave rise through someone
we've already met,

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.418
and we can look at again in a
moment,

00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:47.350
through Girolamo Fracastoro,
in particular,

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.149
to the doctrine of contagion.
 

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:56.418
And it generated also the idea
that disease might be a specific

00:16:56.418 --> 00:16:57.330
entity.
 

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:03.315
Syphilis was clearly something
distinctive, and many people

00:17:03.315 --> 00:17:09.608
regarded it as a disease on its
own, rather than an example of

00:17:09.608 --> 00:17:11.880
humoral imbalance.
 

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:18.970
So, syphilis had an impact on
medical science and influenced,

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:25.825
along with plague the--if we
like, began to make humoral

00:17:25.825 --> 00:17:31.058
doctrine less stable at its
foundations.

00:17:31.058 --> 00:17:32.990
Well, where does syphilis come
from?

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.598
What are its origins?
 

00:17:34.598 --> 00:17:39.442
And here there's a major
debate, that has not been

00:17:39.442 --> 00:17:43.990
resolved, and it continues down
to this day.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.858
I'll put forward a couple of
candidates.

00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:51.890
And I think it's more important
to note these different origins,

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.390
theories of the origins of
syphilis,

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:58.704
because they have a big impact
on how the disease is

00:17:58.704 --> 00:17:59.890
experienced.
 

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:04.586
Rather than expecting us to
resolve the issue of where the

00:18:04.586 --> 00:18:09.118
disease came from in fact,
let's note how people thought

00:18:09.118 --> 00:18:11.180
the disease appeared.
 

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:16.968
A first theory was the one
associated with Christopher

00:18:16.968 --> 00:18:18.170
Columbus.
 

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:23.868
This is the Americanist idea of
the origins of syphilis.

00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:29.940
And we've talked already about
the Columbian Exchange.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.960
So, I just wanted to review
that again.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:38.635
That's Columbus's first trip,
and this is the idea of the

00:18:38.635 --> 00:18:43.743
Columbian Exchange,
of what was transmitted from

00:18:43.743 --> 00:18:48.413
the Old World to the New,
the Old World contributing

00:18:48.413 --> 00:18:52.527
various foodstuffs,
like coffee beans and rice,

00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:55.568
livestock--
cows--and various diseases;

00:18:55.568 --> 00:18:59.588
as you already know,
smallpox, measles and so on,

00:18:59.588 --> 00:19:04.890
and the New World being the
source for Europeans of corn,

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.480
potatoes and so on,
certain precious metals,

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:10.500
tobacco.
 

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:16.526
And there is the idea that the
Americanists--so called--argued

00:19:16.526 --> 00:19:22.257
that it was Columbus and his
crew who brought back syphilis

00:19:22.257 --> 00:19:24.528
from the New World.
 

00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:29.404
This idea held that syphilis
was endemic in the New World,

00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:34.365
spread to Columbus's sailors,
and was reported to Europe on

00:19:34.365 --> 00:19:35.818
their return.
 

00:19:35.818 --> 00:19:37.868
The problem,
of course, for the theory,

00:19:37.868 --> 00:19:40.939
is that there isn't,
in fact, any definitive

00:19:40.939 --> 00:19:45.578
evidence that syphilis did exist
in the New World at the time,

00:19:45.578 --> 00:19:51.529
or that Columbus's sailors were
actually infected in the manner

00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:53.930
required by the theory.
 

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:59.779
So, the evidence in support of
this is entirely circumstantial.

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:01.519
The chronology works.
 

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:03.950
That's one factor.
 

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:07.593
And another is that there
isn't, in fact,

00:20:07.593 --> 00:20:12.785
in the medical literature,
before this time a disease like

00:20:12.785 --> 00:20:15.700
syphilis anywhere in Europe.
 

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:19.616
And more recently,
paleopathologists haven't

00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:24.720
unearthed evidence of syphilis
in European cemeteries.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.471
It clearly seems to be a
disease that was a new--or let

00:20:29.471 --> 00:20:35.190
us use an anachronistic term--an
emerging disease in the 1490s.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:41.573
And because of Eurocentrism,
and perhaps xenophobia,

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:47.078
there was a preference to blame
the other.

00:20:47.078 --> 00:20:53.511
A second idea that was very
popular was that syphilis,

00:20:53.511 --> 00:20:59.459
instead of being of American or
New World origins,

00:20:59.459 --> 00:21:03.950
was of Spanish or African
origin.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.118
This theory held that perhaps
the disease was present in

00:21:08.118 --> 00:21:12.038
Europe for a long time,
but had been confined to a

00:21:12.038 --> 00:21:17.367
small corner of the continent,
perhaps--and one can see

00:21:17.367 --> 00:21:23.496
certain sinister views here--
confined perhaps to Jews,

00:21:23.496 --> 00:21:28.548
or Moors in Spain,
and unnoticed by outsiders.

00:21:28.548 --> 00:21:33.426
Then with the expulsion of the
Jews in the 1490s,

00:21:33.426 --> 00:21:38.000
the disease was disseminated
across Europe.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.643
Now, among those who propounded
this view, there was clearly a

00:21:43.643 --> 00:21:48.269
current of racism,
anti-Semitism and xenophobia.

00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:52.230
Syphilis was supposed to have
been endemic among the Jews,

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:56.548
having come perhaps earlier
from Africa,

00:21:56.548 --> 00:22:02.765
and was prevalent in those
populations because their sex in

00:22:02.765 --> 00:22:07.480
some way was unnatural and out
of control.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.930
So, syphilis was confined in
Europe to Spain,

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:15.380
this theory argues,
until the expulsion of the Jews

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.915
in 1492,
when they unleashed their

00:22:17.915 --> 00:22:19.970
contagion on the rest of Europe.
 

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.440
In any case,
what's really clear is that

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.511
absolutely no one wanted to
acknowledge syphilis as his or

00:22:28.511 --> 00:22:29.578
her own.
 

00:22:29.578 --> 00:22:33.742
For Italians,
syphilis was somebody else's,

00:22:33.742 --> 00:22:36.519
it was the French disease.
 

00:22:36.519 --> 00:22:41.318
For the French,
it was the Neapolitan disease.

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:45.269
For Russians,
it was the Polish disease.

00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:48.901
And for everyone,
it was the Great Pox,

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:50.240
or the clap.
 

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.182
Now, how do we get the term
syphilis, where does that come

00:22:55.182 --> 00:22:55.788
from?
 

00:22:55.788 --> 00:23:00.259
The word itself was coined by
the Italian physician,

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:03.990
whom you've already met,
Fracastoro,

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:07.548
who did something extraordinary
in 1531,

00:23:07.548 --> 00:23:13.650
which was that he wrote a work
called Syphilis.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:19.548
And here was Fracastoro,
whose face you've seen again.

00:23:19.548 --> 00:23:23.788
Now, this work was odd,
or unusual, in a number of

00:23:23.788 --> 00:23:24.740
respects.
 

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.902
It was a poem,
written in Latin,

00:23:27.902 --> 00:23:30.348
and modeled on Virgil.
 

00:23:30.348 --> 00:23:35.861
And, as I think about it,
I can't think at the moment of

00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:39.970
another poem about an epidemic
disease.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.980
It was also an instant success.
 

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.682
It rapidly went through lots of
editions, and established

00:23:47.682 --> 00:23:51.125
Fracastoro's fame,
even more than his more

00:23:51.125 --> 00:23:52.890
scientific works.
 

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:59.221
It also offered what I think we
could say was a clearly

00:23:59.221 --> 00:24:06.490
moralizing, judgmental analysis
of this disease as a scourge of

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:07.430
God.
 

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.480
You know the drill by now.
 

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.896
In the poem,
the first victim of the disease

00:24:14.896 --> 00:24:19.108
was a shepherd whose name was
Syphilis.

00:24:19.108 --> 00:24:24.650
And the shepherd had offended
the gods by turning against them

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.920
and worshipping a king as a
deity.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.422
So, in their anger,
the gods afflicted Syphilis

00:24:32.422 --> 00:24:34.868
with this terrible pox.
 

00:24:34.868 --> 00:24:39.304
We can see that built into it,
from the beginning,

00:24:39.304 --> 00:24:44.825
was the idea that syphilis was
best understood as the wages of

00:24:44.825 --> 00:24:45.548
sin.
 

00:24:45.548 --> 00:24:50.749
And there's a further polemical
thrust that's not made explicit

00:24:50.749 --> 00:24:54.019
but is a subtle undertow in the
poem.

00:24:54.019 --> 00:24:57.650
Remember, the poem was written
in the 1530s,

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:02.190
in the midst of a religious
schism with Martin Luther,

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:06.769
a devout adherent of
orthodoxy--that is,

00:25:06.769 --> 00:25:11.088
Fracastoro was--and of the
Catholic Church.

00:25:11.088 --> 00:25:16.519
He was a physician to bishops,
archbishops and cardinals.

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:18.571
And Syphilis,
as I've said,

00:25:18.571 --> 00:25:21.729
was a shepherd,
and in Latin the word for

00:25:21.729 --> 00:25:24.650
shepherd is
pastor.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:29.380
The man who was punished was a
pastor, not a priest;

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.278
that is, possibly a Protestant
leader.

00:25:32.278 --> 00:25:35.998
So, there's a sly hint here
that syphilis,

00:25:35.998 --> 00:25:39.807
the disease,
is a divine punishment for the

00:25:39.807 --> 00:25:41.259
Reformation.
 

00:25:41.259 --> 00:25:47.700
So, Fracastoro didn't adhere to
the Americanist position.

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:52.836
Then there's perhaps a third
more modern idea,

00:25:52.836 --> 00:25:57.743
or hypothesis,
is that perhaps the causative

00:25:57.743 --> 00:26:03.680
agent of syphilis emerged in a
Darwinian manner;

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.828
the spirochete or treponema
pallidum,

00:26:07.828 --> 00:26:12.987
arose perhaps as a mutation of
some pre-existing treponemes

00:26:12.987 --> 00:26:18.500
that are morphologically very
similar under the microscope,

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:25.089
and perhaps it was--it emerged
as an evolution from the

00:26:25.089 --> 00:26:28.630
treponeme that causes yaws.
 

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.539
In any case,
it was clear that whatever the

00:26:32.539 --> 00:26:36.914
site of its origin,
it spread across Europe with

00:26:36.914 --> 00:26:39.150
terrifying rapidity.
 

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:43.525
One can see the role of
warfare, in particular,

00:26:43.525 --> 00:26:47.328
in promoting the movement of
syphilis.

00:26:47.328 --> 00:26:52.509
And its spread across Europe
was closely associated with

00:26:52.509 --> 00:26:58.130
Charles VIII of France,
known as Charles the Affable,

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:03.888
who lived from 1470 to '98,
and launched a series of wars

00:27:03.888 --> 00:27:07.750
with Italy,
which he invaded in 1494,

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:13.088
at the head of a large,
large army.

00:27:13.088 --> 00:27:18.717
The army marched across the
Italian Peninsula and reached

00:27:18.717 --> 00:27:23.240
Naples, that Charles besieged
and captured.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:28.441
He then found himself facing a
powerful coalition of powers

00:27:28.441 --> 00:27:31.670
that have ultimately defeated
him.

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.924
And after his forced
withdrawal--the point is that

00:27:35.924 --> 00:27:37.750
his army disbanded.
 

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:42.798
And this was a large army,
a mercenary force of tens of

00:27:42.798 --> 00:27:47.098
thousands of men from various
nationalities.

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:54.026
A feature of war is that it's
always a providential time for

00:27:54.026 --> 00:27:58.839
epidemic disease,
and sexually transmitted

00:27:58.839 --> 00:28:02.009
diseases in particular.
 

00:28:02.009 --> 00:28:06.548
The army of Charles VIII was
poorly disciplined.

00:28:06.548 --> 00:28:11.057
It indulged in pillage,
plunder and rape,

00:28:11.057 --> 00:28:16.916
and it had its numerous camp
followers of beggars and

00:28:16.916 --> 00:28:18.720
prostitutes.
 

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.863
So, among the troops,
and those who consorted with

00:28:22.863 --> 00:28:25.400
them, the disease flared up.
 

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.728
And after their disbanding and
demobilization,

00:28:28.728 --> 00:28:31.910
it was disseminated across the
continent.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:38.042
Between 1495 and 1520,
something frightful happened as

00:28:38.042 --> 00:28:43.828
the epidemic swept Europe from
Naples to Moscow;

00:28:43.828 --> 00:28:48.965
to Oslo, Madrid,
London, and every place in

00:28:48.965 --> 00:28:50.190
between.
 

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:54.930
So, this is the origin of
syphilis.

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:58.680
However it arose--whether it
was imported,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.670
whether it was a newly emerging
disease,

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.767
perhaps a mutation from yaws,
from a disease already present

00:29:06.767 --> 00:29:10.516
in Europe--
it was clearly spread by this

00:29:10.516 --> 00:29:16.700
favorable opportunity of warfare
and the army of Charles VIII.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:22.088
Well, what's the etiology and
symptomatology of syphilis?

00:29:22.088 --> 00:29:29.398
And here, this is the causative
agent, the treponema

00:29:29.398 --> 00:29:33.460
pallidum,
or spirochete.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:36.480
This, the treponema
pallidum,

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:42.121
has a special feature,
in that it's exquisitely

00:29:42.121 --> 00:29:48.382
fastidious and fragile,
and re quires very precise

00:29:48.382 --> 00:29:51.808
conditions in order to live.
 

00:29:51.808 --> 00:29:58.000
It cannot survive outside of
bodily fluids and the warmth of

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.511
the human body,
and therefore it can only be

00:30:02.511 --> 00:30:06.288
transmitted by intimate contact.
 

00:30:06.288 --> 00:30:11.530
Indeed, the spirochete is so
delicate that it can hardly be

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:15.905
cultivated in vitro,
and that's one of the reasons

00:30:15.905 --> 00:30:20.578
that the development of a
vaccine has proved so difficult.

00:30:20.578 --> 00:30:26.362
Well, there's an initial
incubation period with syphilis,

00:30:26.362 --> 00:30:31.835
and we'll talk about three
stages in its impact on the

00:30:31.835 --> 00:30:34.519
individual human body.
 

00:30:34.519 --> 00:30:39.160
The first stage--and we're
talking now about the Great Pox,

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.088
this early stage in the history
of syphilis--

00:30:43.088 --> 00:30:48.500
the first stage lasted a month
or two,

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:55.277
and was marked by a painful and
alarming chancre at the site of

00:30:55.277 --> 00:30:59.650
entry of the spirochete into the
body.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:03.433
But this chancre heals
spontaneously,

00:31:03.433 --> 00:31:08.058
just like lesions in chickenpox
or herpes.

00:31:08.058 --> 00:31:13.509
But that doesn't mean that the
patient is cured.

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:19.238
The disease in fact persists,
but for a time without

00:31:19.238 --> 00:31:21.710
generating symptoms.
 

00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:27.346
Then there's the onset of the
second stage of syphilis,

00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:33.713
between forty-five days after
the disappearance of the chancre

00:31:33.713 --> 00:31:35.279
and a year.
 

00:31:35.279 --> 00:31:40.182
There are numerous symptoms,
but in the second stage of

00:31:40.182 --> 00:31:44.903
syphilis only the superficial
tissues of the skin are

00:31:44.903 --> 00:31:47.990
affected, with rash and boils.
 

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:52.393
Now, it was this second stage
of syphilis that was of

00:31:52.393 --> 00:31:57.220
extraordinary severity during
the era of the Great Pox.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.665
It was painful,
disfiguring,

00:32:00.665 --> 00:32:04.880
incapacitating and often fatal.
 

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.799
There were sores and swellings
all over the body,

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:12.965
from the soles of the foot to
the crown of the head,

00:32:12.965 --> 00:32:16.558
leaving disfiguring scabs and
pockmarks.

00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:20.125
Worse, the disease was
described as attacking the whole

00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:21.048
of the body.
 

00:32:21.048 --> 00:32:25.009
It was said to eat it away and
consume it.

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:28.028
The body stank,
and the sufferers were

00:32:28.028 --> 00:32:30.096
afflicted,
in addition,

00:32:30.096 --> 00:32:33.288
with fever and pain in their
joints,

00:32:33.288 --> 00:32:36.490
so intense, one contemporary
wrote,

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.730
that the victims screamed day
and night,

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.400
envying the very dead.
 

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:49.027
Let's listen to Fracastoro
himself, who described the Great

00:32:49.027 --> 00:32:50.578
Pox like this.
 

00:32:50.578 --> 00:32:55.497
He wrote--remember,
he was a physician as well as a

00:32:55.497 --> 00:33:01.201
poet--"In the majority of
cases, small ulcers began to

00:33:01.201 --> 00:33:04.348
appear on the sexual organs.
 

00:33:04.348 --> 00:33:08.528
They were intractable and would
not depart.

00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:13.509
Next, the skin broke out with
encrusted pustules.

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:16.059
They soon grew,
little by little,

00:33:16.059 --> 00:33:19.170
until they were the size of an
acorn;

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.078
which they in fact resembled.
 

00:33:22.078 --> 00:33:27.201
Then these ulcerated pustules
ate away the skin and sometimes

00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:31.980
infected not only the fleshy
parts, but the very bones as

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:32.750
well.
 

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.798
In cases where the malady was
firmly established,

00:33:35.798 --> 00:33:40.356
in the upper parts of the body,
the patient suffered from

00:33:40.356 --> 00:33:44.019
pernicious catarrh that eroded
the palate,

00:33:44.019 --> 00:33:46.880
or the pharynx and tonsils.
 

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.135
In some cases the lips,
the nose and eyes were eaten

00:33:51.135 --> 00:33:55.558
away, or in others,
the whole of the sexual organs.

00:33:55.558 --> 00:33:59.173
Moreover, many patients
suffered from the great

00:33:59.173 --> 00:34:02.788
deformity, or gummata
that developed.

00:34:02.788 --> 00:34:06.650
Besides all of the above
symptoms, as if they were not

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.219
bad enough, violent pains
attacked the muscles.

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:15.574
These pains were persistent,
tormented the sufferer chiefly

00:34:15.574 --> 00:34:21.300
at night, and were the most
cruel of all the symptoms."

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.746
There is a theory that maybe
even the disease was too

00:34:24.746 --> 00:34:28.596
virulent for its own good,
that its symptoms were so

00:34:28.596 --> 00:34:33.219
debilitating as to prevent
sufferers from transmitting it,

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:38.081
and so the modern disease
evolved during the sixteenth and

00:34:38.081 --> 00:34:43.030
seventeenth centuries as a
milder form of the Great Pox.

00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:48.735
I'll show you a couple of
images of extreme forms of

00:34:48.735 --> 00:34:53.545
modern syphilis,
that's said to give us some

00:34:53.545 --> 00:34:58.018
idea of what the Great Pox was
like.

00:34:58.018 --> 00:35:00.670
They're rather,
of course, unpleasant slides.

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.809
So, I would tell you that in
advance.

00:35:02.809 --> 00:35:07.811
But this will give you some
idea of how terrible the Great

00:35:07.811 --> 00:35:08.690
Pox was.
 

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:15.940
It looked like that,
or indeed like that.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.670
We'll move on.
 

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:24.652
Then there's third-stage
syphilis, tertiary syphilis,

00:35:24.652 --> 00:35:31.670
and in this phase you have
involvement of the deep tissues.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:36.260
And its symptoms are things
such as what's called tabes

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:40.311
dorsalis,
which is a degeneration of the

00:35:40.311 --> 00:35:45.365
neurons in the spinal cord,
and leads therefore to lack of

00:35:45.365 --> 00:35:48.827
coordination,
to a stumbling gait,

00:35:48.827 --> 00:35:54.606
and symptoms of that kind;
to ataxia, which means the

00:35:54.606 --> 00:35:56.280
stumbling gait.
 

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.336
It also leads,
in this phase,

00:35:59.336 --> 00:36:05.561
to cardiovascular disease,
often to insanity and dementia,

00:36:05.561 --> 00:36:09.820
to general paralysis,
and to death.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:15.780
So, tertiary syphilis can be
the cause of death.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:20.800
What were--if that's what the
disease looked like--what were

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.610
some of its effects on society?
 

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.139
Well, because of its mode of
transmission,

00:36:27.139 --> 00:36:33.360
syphilis was associated with
terrible social effects,

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.068
with anxiety,
guilt, pain,

00:36:38.068 --> 00:36:44.802
broken relationships,
breakdowns in trust within

00:36:44.802 --> 00:36:49.139
families,
infertility among women.

00:36:49.139 --> 00:36:53.795
And like the plague,
and unlike some of the diseases

00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:58.449
that we'll be studying,
syphilis was no respecter of

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:02.010
persons, of social class or
status.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:08.170
We might perhaps ironically
call it a democratic disease,

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.856
in that it afflicted everyone,
from the bottom of the social

00:37:11.856 --> 00:37:13.815
scale,
to aristocrats,

00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:17.608
learned professionals,
kings, cardinals,

00:37:17.608 --> 00:37:20.820
bishops, occasionally even
popes,

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:27.268
such as Julius II,
who was also a syphilitic.

00:37:27.268 --> 00:37:30.041
So, accordingly,
one might argue,

00:37:30.041 --> 00:37:33.940
syphilis caused a great strain
on society,

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:40.880
but not along the fissures
running between classes,

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:46.219
as did, for example,
Asiatic cholera.

00:37:46.219 --> 00:37:50.818
It was also unlike plague in
that it was not terrifyingly

00:37:50.818 --> 00:37:55.170
swift, and its obvious
association with sex meant that

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:58.210
the means to avoid it were
clear.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:03.590
And so there was no generalized
terror, of the kind that

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:08.679
accompanied say bubonic plague
or Asiatic cholera.

00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:14.659
Everyone knew how syphilis
could be avoided.

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:18.170
What were the effects on then?
 

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:21.639
One was a new asceticism.
 

00:38:21.639 --> 00:38:26.030
There was a suspicion of
pleasures.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.224
In the Protestant world,
an epidemic of syphilis was

00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:35.351
perfectly timed not to create--
and here I don't want to be

00:38:35.351 --> 00:38:39.820
saying that epidemic diseases
created Puritanism;

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.746
I would argue instead simply
that this is a disease that

00:38:44.746 --> 00:38:46.179
reinforced it.
 

00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:51.081
Asceticism indeed had long been
present in European culture,

00:38:51.081 --> 00:38:55.815
but syphilis helped make it
more popular and a widely held

00:38:55.815 --> 00:38:56.980
sentiment.
 

00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:01.048
In the Catholic world,
one can see a new piety as

00:39:01.048 --> 00:39:05.032
well, in the Catholic
Reformation, in Jansenism,

00:39:05.032 --> 00:39:06.389
for example.
 

00:39:06.389 --> 00:39:11.768
Another impact clearly was in
terms of tensions between the

00:39:11.768 --> 00:39:12.510
sexes.
 

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:16.583
Now, this is familiar to you;
we're going back over old

00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:18.320
ground in our course.
 

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:23.463
Remember paintings that we saw
earlier of the Garden of Eden

00:39:23.463 --> 00:39:27.125
and Origin Sin,
Adam drawn into evil by his

00:39:27.125 --> 00:39:30.699
helpmate Eve,
the original temptress.

00:39:30.699 --> 00:39:36.438
Well, the passage of syphilis
was marked by a sinister

00:39:36.438 --> 00:39:38.929
undertow of misogyny.
 

00:39:38.929 --> 00:39:42.789
In a patriarchal society,
male fears,

00:39:42.789 --> 00:39:48.409
anxieties, and indeed guilt,
were projected onto women,

00:39:48.409 --> 00:39:53.525
who were seen as the crucial
agents in the spread of this

00:39:53.525 --> 00:39:55.079
disease to men.
 

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:59.525
And two groups of women were
particularly suspect,

00:39:59.525 --> 00:40:01.340
prostitutes first.
 

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.590
And here was a prime example of
a new male double standard.

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:11.101
The passage of syphilis was
marked by harsh police measures

00:40:11.101 --> 00:40:14.885
against prostitutes,
including the closing of

00:40:14.885 --> 00:40:19.211
brothels and the rounding up and
exile of people from

00:40:19.211 --> 00:40:20.460
communities.
 

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:26.333
There was also a hunt for
scapegoats, and witch hunts were

00:40:26.333 --> 00:40:27.880
part of that.
 

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:31.840
Another feature was a new
religious cult;

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:35.489
the cult, in particular,
of a new saint.

00:40:35.489 --> 00:40:40.159
And this is rather unique,
which is there's only,

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:44.974
as far as I know,
one saint who wasn't a

00:40:44.974 --> 00:40:48.431
Christian,
and this is Job,

00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:53.409
from the Book of Job in the Old
Testament.

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:58.706
Job, however,
was actually said--in the Book

00:40:58.706 --> 00:41:05.606
of Job, he had an especially
convincing defense attorney,

00:41:05.606 --> 00:41:09.179
and that was God himself.
 

00:41:09.179 --> 00:41:14.748
Because God says in the Book of
Job that this is the most just

00:41:14.748 --> 00:41:18.949
of all men, he's the best and
most innocent.

00:41:18.949 --> 00:41:23.079
And yet to try his faith,
he was scourged by Satan.

00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:30.315
This is a painting by William
Blake of this scourging of Job

00:41:30.315 --> 00:41:37.550
by Satan, who's pouring out
boils that will soon torment him

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.250
from head to foot.
 

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:44.655
And the description of the
disease that afflicted Job,

00:41:44.655 --> 00:41:48.811
in the Book of Job,
is highly suggestive of what we

00:41:48.811 --> 00:41:52.219
might call a venereal disease or
STD.

00:41:52.219 --> 00:41:55.320
He was covered from head to
foot in boils.

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.010
And yet Job was reassuringly
free from sin.

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:02.719
We know that because God tells
us so.

00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:08.420
And, so, Job became the patron
saint of syphilitics.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:12.360
There was also a public health
response;

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.585
that is to say,
the building of hospitals for

00:42:15.585 --> 00:42:18.739
the incurables,
who were the syphilitics.

00:42:18.739 --> 00:42:21.184
And there was a new
philanthropy,

00:42:21.184 --> 00:42:24.929
and religious orders that took
over their care.

00:42:24.929 --> 00:42:28.952
Let's look for a moment at some
of the treatment regimens that

00:42:28.952 --> 00:42:31.460
were also important in this
disease.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:37.411
One was the beginning--it
began, the most common treatment

00:42:37.411 --> 00:42:40.733
regimen,
with a forty-day period,

00:42:40.733 --> 00:42:45.496
beginning with fasting,
and then the administration of

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.862
mercury,
which had been used in the

00:42:47.862 --> 00:42:50.750
treatment of skin disorders over
the centuries,

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.449
diseases such as scabies.
 

00:42:53.449 --> 00:42:57.420
So, mercury was sometimes
applied--it was applied in lots

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.840
of different ways.
 

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:03.489
Disparate remedies for a
desperate disease.

00:43:03.489 --> 00:43:07.570
Ointments were applied to the
skin lesions.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:12.224
There was a so-called general
friction in which applications

00:43:12.224 --> 00:43:15.460
of mercury were made to the
whole body.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:19.719
Sometimes it was administered
internally.

00:43:19.719 --> 00:43:24.119
But as you know,
mercury is extremely toxic.

00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:28.891
It causes great salivation,
the falling out of the teeth,

00:43:28.891 --> 00:43:33.579
and then serious and often
life-threatening symptoms.

00:43:33.579 --> 00:43:37.030
But salivation seemed to be the
right approach.

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:41.643
According to humoralist
principles, it would lead to an

00:43:41.643 --> 00:43:44.550
evacuation of the peccant humor.
 

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:47.449
And it also--and here was a
factor--

00:43:47.449 --> 00:43:53.159
it seemed to work when applied
to second-stage syphilis,

00:43:53.159 --> 00:43:56.380
perhaps simply because,
as we've already seen,

00:43:56.380 --> 00:44:01.663
second-stage syphilis goes into
spontaneous and often lengthy

00:44:01.663 --> 00:44:02.719
remission.
 

00:44:02.719 --> 00:44:06.510
And it was possible to argue
that it was the therapy,

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:09.500
the treatment,
that had been effective.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:14.528
And perhaps the suffering that
accompanied this particular

00:44:14.528 --> 00:44:19.295
treatment provided some moral
satisfaction to those who

00:44:19.295 --> 00:44:21.059
administered it.
 

00:44:21.059 --> 00:44:27.764
Another remedy that was tried
was guaiac, which is a hardwood

00:44:27.764 --> 00:44:31.230
from a tree in the New World.
 

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:35.547
It was ground into sawdust and
made into a decoction that

00:44:35.547 --> 00:44:38.940
patients drank twice a day for
forty days.

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.849
We see these forty days
appearing over and over:

00:44:42.849 --> 00:44:45.809
in quarantine;
the forty day fasting;

00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:49.610
the regimen for mercury;
the regimen for guaiac.

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:53.585
Well, all of this,
of course, had a religious

00:44:53.585 --> 00:44:54.760
background.
 

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:59.204
And, so, the guaiac was
administered for forty days,

00:44:59.204 --> 00:45:02.079
during which there was fasting.
 

00:45:02.079 --> 00:45:07.146
At the same time then--so
guaiac and mercury were,

00:45:07.146 --> 00:45:10.663
so we might say,
the miracle drugs,

00:45:10.663 --> 00:45:14.179
the wonder drugs of their era.
 

00:45:14.179 --> 00:45:19.804
There were other indications
also recommended for syphilis:

00:45:19.804 --> 00:45:22.713
bloodletting,
baths, purgation,

00:45:22.713 --> 00:45:25.719
cauterization of the boils.
 

00:45:25.719 --> 00:45:30.519
An important impact,
then--the next thing I want to

00:45:30.519 --> 00:45:36.090
point out--is the impact of
syphilis on medical science.

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:40.518
We already--and this gives us a
moment of review--we know

00:45:40.518 --> 00:45:45.500
already the traditional approach
to these and other diseases;

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.969
that they were an imbalance of
humors.

00:45:48.969 --> 00:45:52.956
There had been no idea of
discrete entities that were

00:45:52.956 --> 00:45:53.800
diseases.
 

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.052
Diseases were an individual
matter, depending on the

00:45:58.052 --> 00:46:02.971
constitution of the patient and
the environmental influences

00:46:02.971 --> 00:46:05.389
that acted on him or her.
 

00:46:05.389 --> 00:46:07.210
In the nineteenth century,
however,

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:11.719
we've seen already that
diseases fully crystallized into

00:46:11.719 --> 00:46:16.400
forms of specific entities,
that were actually biological

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.840
entities that existed apart from
the body of the individual

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:21.760
sufferer.
 

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:28.389
The period from the 1490s to
the nineteenth century,

00:46:28.389 --> 00:46:33.409
the period that emplaced both
plague and the Great Pox,

00:46:33.409 --> 00:46:37.550
and then modern syphilis,
marked an era of transition.

00:46:37.550 --> 00:46:41.971
And I would argue that syphilis
was something that propelled

00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:43.920
this transition forward.
 

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.195
Remember how traditional
medicine, as taught at

00:46:47.195 --> 00:46:51.039
universities and practiced by
the elite physicians,

00:46:51.039 --> 00:46:55.367
was that the truth about
disease was to read the

00:46:55.367 --> 00:46:59.601
classics: Hippocrates and Galen,
supplemented later,

00:46:59.601 --> 00:47:02.980
in the Middle Ages,
by astrology.

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:05.659
So, for humoralist physicians,
then,

00:47:05.659 --> 00:47:09.333
that was the way it was
preceded, and when syphilis

00:47:09.333 --> 00:47:12.510
first struck,
there were disputations in

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:17.282
which people sought the truth of
the disease by looking through

00:47:17.282 --> 00:47:21.739
into Hippocrates,
or what Galen had written.

00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:27.443
And so there were disputes,
disputations that were formally

00:47:27.443 --> 00:47:30.590
held through library medicine.
 

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:36.059
The challenge of syphilis was
that it was a pandemic that was

00:47:36.059 --> 00:47:41.072
difficult to explain within the
traditional framework of

00:47:41.072 --> 00:47:42.440
humoralism.
 

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.170
At the same time,
the disease had no real place

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.630
in the Classics.
 

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:51.643
Humoralism was static,
and had no way of accommodating

00:47:51.643 --> 00:47:53.159
emerging diseases.
 

00:47:53.159 --> 00:47:57.655
So, what do you do with a
disease that was unknown to the

00:47:57.655 --> 00:47:58.539
Ancients?
 

00:47:58.539 --> 00:48:02.070
Syphilis was also clearly
contagious,

00:48:02.070 --> 00:48:06.327
everyone could see that,
and so there was obviously some

00:48:06.327 --> 00:48:10.820
morbific substance that passed
from one body to another.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.585
The disease,
in other words,

00:48:12.585 --> 00:48:14.809
seemed to be something
specific;

00:48:14.809 --> 00:48:20.195
and this helped to promote also
the idea of a new concept of

00:48:20.195 --> 00:48:21.110
disease.
 

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:25.596
And syphilis tried physicians
because it really was an

00:48:25.596 --> 00:48:30.543
incurable disease at the time,
and until the late twentieth

00:48:30.543 --> 00:48:35.003
century didn't respond to the
classical recommendations for

00:48:35.003 --> 00:48:35.849
therapy.
 

00:48:35.849 --> 00:48:40.550
All of this made it a major
challenge to humoralist

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.679
orthodoxy.
 

00:48:41.679 --> 00:48:46.641
And with that,
I would say we've reviewed this

00:48:46.641 --> 00:48:53.365
period of syphilis and plague
that presented a major impact on

00:48:53.365 --> 00:48:57.333
society,
and a major impact on medical

00:48:57.333 --> 00:48:58.119
science.
 

00:48:58.119 --> 00:49:00.789
And we've run out of time this
morning.

00:49:00.789 --> 00:49:04.300
Next time, having had our
review session,

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.666
we'll come back to the
nineteenth century and deal with

00:49:08.666 --> 00:49:12.320
the debate,
the huge medical debate,

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.150
between contagionists and
anti-contagionists.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:22.000

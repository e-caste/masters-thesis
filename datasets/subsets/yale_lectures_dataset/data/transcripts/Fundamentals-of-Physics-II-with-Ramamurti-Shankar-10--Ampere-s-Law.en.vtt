00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.000
Prof: Let's start.
 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.292
I told you about Ampere's law,
which is key to what we are

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:12.606
going to do next,
so I'll remind you what the

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:13.510
deal is.
 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:22.043
It says, if you have a closed
loop and around that loop you

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:28.517
integrate the magnetic field
that is equal to

00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:37.051
Î¼_0 times all the
currents that penetrate this

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:38.670
loop.
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.912
So some current would be going
in, some current would be coming

00:00:43.912 --> 00:00:44.420
out.
 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.840
The guys who are outside the
loop don't contribute.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.960
Guys who are trapped inside
this, they make a contribution.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.210
That's Ampere's law.
 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.140
Now you have to know the
convention.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.872
The convention is that you do
the line integral

00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:07.980
counterclockwise,
and if your fingers are

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.204
following the line integral,
your thumb points towards

00:01:11.204 --> 00:01:14.968
outside the board,
and that current is positive.

00:01:14.968 --> 00:01:17.805
Anything going into the board
therefore will be counted as

00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:18.950
negative in this one.
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.519
So this has to be counted with
sign, do you understand?

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:25.983
If the contour goes one way,
all currents coming out of the

00:01:25.983 --> 00:01:28.433
board are positive,
all those going in are

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:29.209
negative.
 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.305
In particular,
if these 4 currents add up

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:35.007
algebraically to 0,
one is 2 amp,

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:38.928
another is -2 amp and so on,
then this integral will vanish,

00:01:38.928 --> 00:01:40.599
even though there are currents.
 

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:44.654
So it counts not the absolute
value but the algebraic sum of

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:45.959
all the currents.
 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:49.019
Now there's another subtlety I
didn't get into last time,

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:56.616
which is the following -
remember, this is the current

00:01:56.616 --> 00:02:02.849
penetrating a surface,
bounded by this loop.

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:05.519
You guys with me on what that
means?

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:09.324
Now as long as I force you to
put this loop and to live in the

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:12.628
plane of the blackboard,
there's only one surface with

00:02:12.628 --> 00:02:14.500
that loop as the boundary.
 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.254
But in real life,
we are doing stuff in three

00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:18.068
dimensions.
 

00:02:18.068 --> 00:02:20.139
Imagine pulling this loop out
of the blackboard.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.389
A lot of currents are coming
and going out.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:27.729
What is the surface of which
this loop is the boundary?

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.449
The answer is not unique.
 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.406
There are many,
many surfaces that have the

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:35.870
same loop as the boundary,
right?

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.000
Take a piece of wire and wrap
it in the form of this boundary

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.685
and dip it in soap,
and you pull it out,

00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:44.818
you'll get a soap filament.
 

00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:48.818
That soap filament has as its
rim, or the boundary,

00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:49.780
this loop.
 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.150
That may not even be planar.
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.390
And if you blow on it,
it's going to bulge outside,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.750
right?
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.074
Still this rim will be the
boundary of that bulging

00:02:58.074 --> 00:02:58.740
surface.
 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.275
So actually,
even if the surface is coming

00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:06.758
out of the blackboard,
the theorem is still valid.

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:09.038
So let me draw another picture
that may be helpful.

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:12.756
Suppose this is the surface and
you've got all these currents,

00:03:12.756 --> 00:03:14.949
some going in and some coming
out.

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:18.038
You may have imagined all this
time I meant a flat planar

00:03:18.038 --> 00:03:18.590
surface.
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.590
I don't.
 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.651
You can imagine now a curvy
surface, like maybe a

00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:28.220
hemisphere, of which this rim is
still the boundary.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.408
You can ask,
"How can that be?

00:03:30.408 --> 00:03:31.811
Where do you want me to count
the currents,

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:32.878
here or on that surface?"
 

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:36.410
The answer is,
it doesn't matter.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.800
It doesn't matter because any
current coming in here has to

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.240
get out also through the other
one.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.098
The only--or it may come in and
decide to come back here,

00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:49.930
in which case it doesn't leave
the other one,

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.494
but it will make 0 contribution
to this contour because it's

00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:55.669
coming in once and going out
once.

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.733
Because currents don't
terminate, just like magnetic

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:02.396
field lines, whatever crosses
this surface will also cross any

00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:04.500
surface with the same boundary.
 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.659
That's a fact that will become
important later on.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:10.639
So you follow that?
 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.360
The law, if you want to write
it formally,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.680
I'm going to write it as some
surface,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.389
and this is the surface
integral of the current density,

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:22.290
which is the current per unit
area.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.454
And this loop is the boundary
of that surface,

00:04:25.454 --> 00:04:28.899
and I told you that the
boundary of any surface is

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:31.149
written as partial S.
 

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:34.170
This is the correct way to
write Ampere's law.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.547
And the point I'm making is,
this could be any surface with

00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:41.680
that as the boundary.
 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.795
Now once you've got Ampere's
law, I was trying to show you

00:04:45.795 --> 00:04:50.055
how you can use it to solve
certain problems that might have

00:04:50.055 --> 00:04:52.149
otherwise been difficult.
 

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:53.750
Just like Gauss's law.
 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.095
Remember, Gauss's law was very
helpful when you took a solid

00:04:57.095 --> 00:04:58.060
ball of charge.
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.538
The electric field of that is
usually hard to find,

00:05:00.538 --> 00:05:03.415
but from spherical symmetry,
you know the field is radially

00:05:03.415 --> 00:05:04.060
outwards.
 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.838
You draw a Gaussian surface and
you know the field's magnitude

00:05:07.838 --> 00:05:09.449
is constant on a sphere.
 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:10.170
How big is it?
 

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.980
You get that from Gauss's law.
 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.560
So certain problems which are
highly symmetric,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.519
you can get using Ampere's law
also.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.776
So one example I did,
I want to repeat it,

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:22.980
because one thing I said wasn't
right.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.071
There's this current going from
- to infinity,

00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:30.889
and we want to find the field
around it.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:33.269
If you do an honest
calculation, you will say,

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:36.389
let me take a segment,
let me take a point,

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.221
let me join the segment to that
point and take the cross product

00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:42.560
of the
dl with the R,

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.879
etc.
 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.430
and so on, right?
 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.497
And it will give you a
contribution coming out of the

00:05:48.497 --> 00:05:51.329
blackboard, but then you have to
integrate it.

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:54.680
Now you don't have to do all
that if you use symmetry.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.285
The symmetry argument would
tell you first of all that any

00:05:58.285 --> 00:06:01.954
field configuration you have
will be the same if you rotate

00:06:01.954 --> 00:06:03.410
it around a circle.
 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.680
Because if you look at the wire
end on and you turn the wire,

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.899
it looks the same so the field
configuration should look the

00:06:09.899 --> 00:06:10.389
same.
 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.670
And I said there are only a
couple of things that have the

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:13.110
property.
 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.959
Here's a good one.
 

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.910
Maybe it does that.
 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.730
And the other one is this.
 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.980
Here is the wire.
 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.761
Notice if you turn the wire,
the wire looks the same,

00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:26.420
configuration looks the same.
 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.108
If you turn this wire around
its own axis,

00:06:29.108 --> 00:06:32.980
wire looks the same and the
configuration looks the same.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.713
Then I said we rule this guy
out, because magnetic field

00:06:37.713 --> 00:06:41.069
lines cannot come and end at a
point.

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:43.187
Then I gave another
explanation, which is that if

00:06:43.187 --> 00:06:45.964
you reverse the current,
the field lines are supposed to

00:06:45.964 --> 00:06:47.733
go outwards,
but instead of reversing the

00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:49.857
current,
if I grab it and turn it by 180

00:06:49.857 --> 00:06:52.877
degrees around this axis,
then the lines will still go in

00:06:52.877 --> 00:06:54.569
but the current would be
reversed.

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:59.319
So for whatever reason,
this is out and this is in.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:02.310
Then as to the direction of the
field,

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.850
we also know that it has to be
perpendicular to the blackboard,

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:09.156
because the two vectors whose
cross product determines it lie

00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:13.350
in the plane of the blackboard,
so the field has to come out.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.875
It has to come out and the
amount by which it comes out

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:17.839
cannot change as you go around
the loop.

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:23.521
And the answer can only depend
on how far you are from the

00:07:23.521 --> 00:07:24.220
wire.
 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:29.870
Then I write Ampere's law as
2Î R times B at

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.370
the radius r =
Î¼_0 times the

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.519
current.
 

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:38.411
In other words,
I look at the wire from the

00:07:38.411 --> 00:07:42.269
end, and I take any contour I
like of radius r.

00:07:42.269 --> 00:07:45.220
Then since B is
tangential to the circle,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.829
the line integral is simply
2Î r times B,

00:07:47.829 --> 00:07:50.910
and that's the current
enclosed, so you find B.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:52.576
If you like,
B_

00:07:52.576 --> 00:07:54.956
Î¦,
meaning in the azimuthal

00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:55.790
direction.
 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.209
This angle is called phi.
 

00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:02.427
B_Î¦
= Î¼_0

00:08:02.427 --> 00:08:04.579
I/2Î r.
 

00:08:04.579 --> 00:08:08.673
That's the result we got from
integration, but you can also

00:08:08.673 --> 00:08:10.579
get it from Ampere's law.
 

00:08:10.579 --> 00:08:12.120
Then I did another variation.
 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.327
I definitely don't want to
repeat that, which is,

00:08:15.327 --> 00:08:17.199
what if the wire is thick.
 

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:21.857
Not a point wire but got finite
thickness with current coming

00:08:21.857 --> 00:08:23.720
out of the blackboard.
 

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.829
What is going to be the
magnetic field?

00:08:25.829 --> 00:08:30.408
Then the answer depends on
whether you pick a contour like

00:08:30.408 --> 00:08:33.298
this or a contour inside the
wire.

00:08:33.298 --> 00:08:38.119
And if you do the two things,
you'll find the field actually

00:08:38.119 --> 00:08:42.448
grows linearly inside,
then falls like 1 over r

00:08:42.448 --> 00:08:43.428
outside.
 

00:08:43.428 --> 00:08:46.830
Anyway, this is stuff I did
near the end.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:54.604
But now I want to consider two
new problems which I didn't

00:08:54.604 --> 00:08:57.058
study last time.
 

00:08:57.058 --> 00:09:01.760
The first one is going to be
very important,

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.730
is the solenoid.
 

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.869
If you imagine on a tube you
wrap some wire,

00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:10.740
and the wire is wrapped like
this many, many times.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.980
And you want to find the
magnetic field.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.350
Now one loop we know produces a
field that goes like this.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.686
You stack them up,
you expect the field to go like

00:09:24.686 --> 00:09:30.023
that inside the coil,
then sort of loop around and

00:09:30.023 --> 00:09:33.399
come back outside the coil.
 

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:38.225
What we want to find out is the
strength of the field inside the

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:40.139
coil, and also outside.
 

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:45.469
So the way you handle this
problem, you've got to take an

00:09:45.469 --> 00:09:48.990
Amperian loop that looks like
this.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.427
If this is the cardboard on
which you wound that thing,

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:58.440
see what this wire looks like
when you slice it vertically.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.048
That's the tube on which you
wrapped it.

00:10:00.048 --> 00:10:01.990
I want you to slice it
vertically.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.220
On the left hand side,
I've current coming in.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.288
On the right hand side--coming
out of the board and right,

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:14.399
it's going on,
you guys see that?

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:17.389
Wrap it around the solenoid and
slice it down the middle,

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:19.633
then on this end,
the current's coming out,

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:21.769
on this end,
the current's going in.

00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:23.970
So I'm showing you the cross
section of the tube.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:29.330
It looks like this.
 

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:35.090
So first thing I want to argue
is that the field outside does

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:40.082
not vary with distance,
because if I took a loop like

00:10:40.082 --> 00:10:45.220
this--it's not a real loop;
it's a mathematical loop on

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.178
which I'm going to use Ampere's
law.

00:10:48.178 --> 00:10:51.442
I know the field outside is
going to be coming down,

00:10:51.442 --> 00:10:55.216
but maybe it's weaker here and
stronger here and that's what

00:10:55.216 --> 00:10:56.879
I'm going to rule out.
 

00:10:56.879 --> 00:11:00.139
You know how we can rule that
out?

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:06.710
What would go wrong if the
field was weaker here than here?

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:15.740
Something to do with Ampere's
law.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.659
Well, let me explain.
 

00:11:17.659 --> 00:11:21.100
Suppose you go around this loop.
 

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.695
Here B and dl are
perpendicular,

00:11:24.695 --> 00:11:29.169
so there's no contribution to
Bâdl.

00:11:29.169 --> 00:11:31.509
Likewise here.
 

00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:35.883
Here you have a B going
one way and you have the same

00:11:35.883 --> 00:11:39.590
B but the path is going
the opposite way.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.048
Now these two have to cancel.
 

00:11:43.048 --> 00:11:46.931
These two have to cancel
because there is no current

00:11:46.931 --> 00:11:48.529
coming out of this.
 

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:49.808
Because there's no current
coming out,

00:11:49.808 --> 00:11:52.200
this line integral has
vanished, therefore B

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.926
times that length and B
times that length going the

00:11:54.926 --> 00:11:57.029
opposite way must be equal in
magnitude.

00:11:57.029 --> 00:12:01.256
That means the B here
must be as strong as the

00:12:01.256 --> 00:12:02.639
B there.
 

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.370
So B doesn't vary when
you leave the wire.

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.058
Well, I can keep on repeating
this argument until I go all the

00:12:10.058 --> 00:12:12.720
way to infinity,
but I know B is 0.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.120
Therefore coming from infinity
inwards, B is going to be

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.538
0 everywhere here.
 

00:12:18.538 --> 00:12:21.158
That's only true for an
infinite solenoid.

00:12:21.158 --> 00:12:25.458
If you take a finite solenoid,
there will be lines coming in

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:25.970
here.
 

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.956
For an infinite solenoid,
is when the lines always go

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:29.990
perpendicularly.
 

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:33.710
See, in a finite solenoid,
you sort of know the lines will

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:34.820
do this, right?
 

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.557
They'll be perpendicular here,
but they could be at an angle

00:12:37.557 --> 00:12:37.928
there.
 

00:12:37.928 --> 00:12:41.743
But for an infinite solenoid,
every portion looks like you

00:12:41.743 --> 00:12:42.480
are here.
 

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.360
The lines are only vertical,
they have no choice but to

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:45.840
vanish.
 

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.931
So the flux actually goes out
and returns on a sphere of

00:12:50.931 --> 00:12:51.950
infinity.
 

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.178
So we only have to find the
magnetic field inside.

00:12:56.178 --> 00:13:00.389
So then you've got to do the
right hand rule and the right

00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:04.600
hand rule tells you the magnetic
field looks like that.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.590
And the question is,
how big is it?

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:14.371
Once again, I want to argue
that the magnetic field is

00:13:14.371 --> 00:13:17.168
constant inside the solenoid.
 

00:13:17.168 --> 00:13:20.927
Now atleast now you should be
able to guess what argument I

00:13:20.927 --> 00:13:21.639
will use.
 

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:27.654
The argument will be,
take an Amperian loop like this

00:13:27.654 --> 00:13:28.350
one.
 

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.740
The two sides,
this and that,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.918
do not contribute because they
are perpendicular to the field.

00:13:32.918 --> 00:13:37.048
These two better make
cancelling contributions.

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:38.980
And that's going up and that's
going down.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:41.346
For them to cancel,
the strength of the field here

00:13:41.346 --> 00:13:43.279
must be the same as the strength
here.

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:46.976
So we have a result of the
magnetic field as some number

00:13:46.976 --> 00:13:51.210
inside and 0 outside and we're
trying to find the one number.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.312
This is going to be the case
whenever you use Ampere's law to

00:13:54.312 --> 00:13:55.090
get anything.
 

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.734
In the end, Ampere's law is a
single statement about the

00:13:59.734 --> 00:14:01.168
magnetic field.
 

00:14:01.168 --> 00:14:04.570
You can get only one piece of
information from it.

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.722
If you reduced your problem to
the point where there's only one

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.418
thing you do not know,
you can find that one thing.

00:14:10.418 --> 00:14:13.432
Here I've talked my way out of
the field in this region and

00:14:13.432 --> 00:14:16.341
that region, and here it's
constant, and it's got a known

00:14:16.341 --> 00:14:17.070
direction.
 

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.330
Only thing I don't know is,
how big is it?

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:27.830
To find how big it is,
you can take a loop like this.

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.149
Let me take a loop like this
one.

00:14:31.149 --> 00:14:32.610
Let me repeat that for you.
 

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:40.961
So here is the current coming
out and I want to take a loop

00:14:40.961 --> 00:14:42.690
like this.
 

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:50.389
I want the loop to have length
l.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:53.339
So the magnetic field is some
number B there which I

00:14:53.339 --> 00:14:54.000
don't know.
 

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.039
It is 0 on the outside and I
never care about these sides

00:14:58.039 --> 00:15:00.350
because they're perpendicular.
 

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:04.524
So the line integral will be
B times l.going

00:15:04.524 --> 00:15:08.114
up, nothing there,
0 times l.going down and

00:15:08.114 --> 00:15:09.360
nothing here.
 

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.980
That's the whole line integral,
Bâ

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.288
dl..
 

00:15:13.288 --> 00:15:19.028
That = Î¼_0 times
the current crossing the loop.

00:15:19.028 --> 00:15:22.544
Now here's where you should not
make the mistake of saying

00:15:22.544 --> 00:15:25.567
there's a current I
flowing in the wire and

00:15:25.567 --> 00:15:27.850
therefore it's equal to
I.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:35.320
Can you tell me what's wrong
with that logic?

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:36.990
Yes?
 

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.620
Student:  It's coiling
around so you have to count the

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.009
number of coils.
 

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:45.129
Prof: You understand
that?

00:15:45.129 --> 00:15:48.178
First of all,
if you just walked into the

00:15:48.178 --> 00:15:51.610
class now, first of all,
you're in trouble.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.035
Secondly, if you just walked
into the class and you saw this

00:15:54.035 --> 00:15:55.970
picture and you knew all about
Ampere's law,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.220
did not know anything about
solenoid,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.320
nothing, what will you do?
 

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.908
You'll say, "Here's a
loop, current's coming out.

00:16:01.908 --> 00:16:03.798
I just count the current coming
in."

00:16:03.798 --> 00:16:06.932
The fact that these guys all
belong to a big solenoid and

00:16:06.932 --> 00:16:08.778
they wrap around is irrelevant.
 

00:16:08.778 --> 00:16:12.014
All that matters for the
Ampere's loop is how much amps

00:16:12.014 --> 00:16:14.470
are coming at me or going away
from me.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:17.057
So the fact that they're all
part of one gigantic loop is

00:16:17.057 --> 00:16:17.658
irrelevant.
 

00:16:17.658 --> 00:16:21.097
So you've got to count the
number of turns that got trapped

00:16:21.097 --> 00:16:22.639
in this length l.
 

00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:28.750
So we use the symbol small
n, which is the number of

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.278
turns per unit length.
 

00:16:31.278 --> 00:16:36.683
Then it's going to be number of
turns per unit length times

00:16:36.683 --> 00:16:37.710
l.
 

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:40.139
So that depends on how tightly
you wound the coil.

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:43.844
If you wound 100 turns per
centimeter, well,

00:16:43.844 --> 00:16:47.288
it's whatever,
10,000 turns per meter.

00:16:47.288 --> 00:16:50.879
Now one nice thing is that this
l cancels.

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:56.250
Again, I want you to think
about why l should

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.200
cancel.
 

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:04.160
Why shouldn't the answer depend
on l?

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.749
This happens even when you do
Gauss's law, when you take some

00:17:07.749 --> 00:17:11.099
surface, the details of the
surface cancel out always.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:11.710
Yes?
 

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:19.078
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:19.078 --> 00:17:20.838
Prof: More turns of the
wire.

00:17:20.838 --> 00:17:24.724
But the more important thing
is, the question that was given

00:17:24.724 --> 00:17:26.240
to us was a solenoid.
 

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.930
It had some number of turns.
 

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:31.798
It had a certain current.
 

00:17:31.798 --> 00:17:34.921
And the answer should only
depend on the current and how

00:17:34.921 --> 00:17:36.170
densely it is wound.
 

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.134
This l.
 

00:17:37.134 --> 00:17:38.578
was my own artifact.
 

00:17:38.578 --> 00:17:41.859
The Amperian loop is not a real
loop.

00:17:41.859 --> 00:17:43.130
I made it up.
 

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.538
So the answer I get for
B cannot depend on

00:17:45.538 --> 00:17:48.200
whether I took that loop or that
loop or that loop.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.500
They should all give the same
answer.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.114
That's why the properties of
the loop should cancel out and

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:56.729
you should get in the end a
result that depends only on the

00:17:56.729 --> 00:17:59.160
intrinsic variables in the
problem.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.380
So this is a very useful result.
 

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.819
That's why we draw a box around
it.

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:06.410
That means important.
 

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:10.890
The field inside a solenoid is
Î¼_0 times the

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.690
number of turns per unit length,
times the current flowing to

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.048
the solenoid.
 

00:18:17.048 --> 00:18:19.240
I'll be invoking this result
all the time.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.368
It's one of the few results I
carry in my head.

00:18:21.368 --> 00:18:25.420
Normally I encourage you not to
carry too much stuff in your

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.028
head, but this guy's pretty
helpful.

00:18:28.028 --> 00:18:30.919
So here's another solenoid that
people have, which is better

00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:32.828
than this one in the following
sense.

00:18:32.828 --> 00:18:36.496
As long as you make a finite
solenoid--in real life,

00:18:36.496 --> 00:18:40.450
everything is finite--you will
have this return flux.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:44.779
There's a trick by which you
can keep all the flux hidden

00:18:44.779 --> 00:18:48.104
inside the tube,
by wrapping the tube into a

00:18:48.104 --> 00:18:49.108
doughnut.
 

00:18:49.108 --> 00:18:54.612
So take the long tube and glue
the ends together,

00:18:54.612 --> 00:19:01.605
then you have a solenoid which
is like a doughnut on which you

00:19:01.605 --> 00:19:03.670
wrap the wire.
 

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:05.278
I've shown you a few turns.
 

00:19:05.278 --> 00:19:08.942
So you wrap it all the way
round and you come back and you

00:19:08.942 --> 00:19:10.869
drive the current from here.
 

00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:11.578
Are you guys with me?
 

00:19:11.578 --> 00:19:15.398
The cross section of the
doughnut can be circular,

00:19:15.398 --> 00:19:16.880
it can be square.
 

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.338
It doesn't matter what it is.
 

00:19:18.338 --> 00:19:20.607
Sometimes it even contains some
metal or iron,

00:19:20.607 --> 00:19:22.019
which I'm not showing you.
 

00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:22.602
It's fine.
 

00:19:22.602 --> 00:19:25.920
Even if it's an empty tube,
you wrap the wire around it.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:34.358
But now the flux lines go like
this along the tube.

00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:39.164
So let me take a problem where
the cross section is actually a

00:19:39.164 --> 00:19:42.710
square, in other words,
it looks like this.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:48.843
I cut the doughnut right there
and I slice it and I look at it,

00:19:48.843 --> 00:19:52.900
and you have the flux lines
doing that.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.619
That's the cross section.
 

00:19:54.619 --> 00:19:55.940
So which way is the flux going?
 

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:58.009
Well, you've got to figure out
again with the right hand rule,

00:19:58.009 --> 00:20:01.989
the way I've shown the
currents, if you do this around

00:20:01.989 --> 00:20:06.410
the wire,
the flux is actually going like

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.660
that here.
 

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.941
Our job is to find out what is
the magnetic field inside that

00:20:12.941 --> 00:20:13.910
doughnut.
 

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.465
For that, I'm going to slice
the doughnut the way you

00:20:18.465 --> 00:20:20.920
normally slice a doughnut.
 

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.220
You normally slice a doughnut
so it looks like this.

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.548
This is half the doughnut, okay?
 

00:20:28.548 --> 00:20:32.720
You cut it, then let's say the
wire looks like that one.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.911
That guy is coming in,
coming out of the board,

00:20:36.911 --> 00:20:41.010
going into the board,
coming out of the board,

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.289
going into the board.
 

00:20:43.289 --> 00:20:44.750
Yes? Can you see that?
 

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.163
If you take a doughnut with a
wire wrapped around it and you

00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:50.420
cut it, it's going to look like
this.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.182
Now the important thing to
notice is that we haven't really

00:20:54.182 --> 00:20:55.480
cut that doughnut.
 

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.539
If you really cut the doughnut,
there's going to be no current.

00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:00.519
This is a mental slice you make.
 

00:21:00.519 --> 00:21:05.586
Then you ask yourself,
now what do you think is going

00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:08.118
to be the Amperian loop?
 

00:21:08.118 --> 00:21:13.329
Can you make a guess what the
loop will look like?

00:21:13.329 --> 00:21:14.140
Yes?
 

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:16.680
Student:  It will look
like a piece of pie.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.809
Prof: A piece of pie.
 

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:18.950
We're all getting hungry now.
 

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:20.730
I've talked about doughnuts.
 

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:21.670
Which pie?
 

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.941
Student:  It will have
it so that the sides

00:21:23.941 --> 00:21:26.730
perpendicular to the--
Prof: Oh, okay.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:31.973
Maybe you could do that,
but here is what the general

00:21:31.973 --> 00:21:37.318
consensus, 9 out of 10
physicists use this contour.

00:21:37.318 --> 00:21:41.950
This is going to be the
Amperian loop.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.220
Then what can you say?
 

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:47.118
The loop has some radius
r,

00:21:47.118 --> 00:21:51.039
so once again,
2Î r times B is

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:56.267
Î¼_0I times
the number of turns altogether

00:21:56.267 --> 00:21:58.009
in the solenoid.
 

00:21:58.009 --> 00:21:59.630
You understand?
 

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:06.150
Because this loop cuts through
every turn of wire.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:10.450
As far as the direction is
concerned, it will go like this.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:16.420
The field will go this way.
 

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:23.086
So the magnetic field here is
Î¼_0IN

00:22:23.086 --> 00:22:26.420
divided by 2Î r.
 

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.980
So the field actually gets
weaker, so that if you cut this

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.791
doughnut, the field on the inner
rim will be stronger than the

00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:35.480
field on the outer rim.
 

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:38.450
And if you go inside the inner
rim, you'll get 0;

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:42.069
outside the outer rim,
you'll get 0 because any loop

00:22:42.069 --> 00:22:46.045
you draw on the contour will
intersect an equal number of

00:22:46.045 --> 00:22:48.529
incoming and outgoing currents.
 

00:22:48.529 --> 00:22:50.740
So B is going to vanish
outside the doughnut,

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:54.185
and it's going to be non-zero
right inside the heart of the

00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:59.720
doughnut,
and the strength will be this.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.252
Now if this doughnut had a
radius of say 1 light year,

00:23:03.252 --> 00:23:06.318
you can ask what will happen to
the formula.

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:09.680
You should be ready for what
you expect.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.910
Take a doughnut 10 miles long,
10 miles in circumference.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:17.019
What do you hope the formula to
give?

00:23:17.019 --> 00:23:17.788
Yes.
 

00:23:17.788 --> 00:23:19.836
Student:  It should
approach the results of the

00:23:19.836 --> 00:23:20.608
infinite solenoid.
 

00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:21.598
Prof: For infinite
solenoid,

00:23:21.598 --> 00:23:24.818
because the circle of radius 10
zillion miles,

00:23:24.818 --> 00:23:26.942
for most purposes,
it's like a straight tube,

00:23:26.942 --> 00:23:27.328
right?
 

00:23:27.328 --> 00:23:29.589
You cannot tell it's going
around in a circle.

00:23:29.589 --> 00:23:30.660
Let's see if that happens.
 

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:34.915
Well, you can see the field is
Î¼_0NI,

00:23:34.915 --> 00:23:39.173
divided by 2Î r is
just the circumference of the

00:23:39.173 --> 00:23:40.009
circle.
 

00:23:40.009 --> 00:23:42.663
So it's going to be
Î¼_0 little n

00:23:42.663 --> 00:23:48.818
times I,
because little n is big

00:23:48.818 --> 00:23:54.910
N divided by
2Î r.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:55.400
See that?
 

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.210
This 2Î r will-- in
other words,

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.660
you cut it here and you open it
into a solenoid,

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.410
its length will be
2Î r,

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.336
and the number of turns per
unit length will be big N

00:24:04.336 --> 00:24:05.380
over 2Î r.
 

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.385
But that's an approximation,
because in a real finite

00:24:08.385 --> 00:24:10.930
system, the magnetic field is
not uniform.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:14.960
There's a slight variation from
this end to that end.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:18.625
But if this thickness is 2
inches and that radius is 37

00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:22.289
miles, that variation is
negligible and it becomes that

00:24:22.289 --> 00:24:23.920
other easier result.
 

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:30.150
Student:  How did you
get the small n again?

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:35.828
Prof: We got the small n
because this guy.

00:24:35.828 --> 00:24:38.983
This is the total number of
turns wrapped around the

00:24:38.983 --> 00:24:41.891
solenoid and 2Î r is
the circumference,

00:24:41.891 --> 00:24:42.509
right?
 

00:24:42.509 --> 00:24:47.079
So number of turns divided by
the circumference will be the

00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:49.759
number of turns per unit length.
 

00:24:49.759 --> 00:24:51.818
In other words,
if it was a huge solenoid,

00:24:51.818 --> 00:24:54.840
so huge that it looked like a
straight line to you from your

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.528
range of observation,
the number of turns it would

00:24:57.528 --> 00:25:00.078
have per unit length would be
exactly this much.

00:25:00.078 --> 00:25:04.271
So it will look like a straight
solenoid to you,

00:25:04.271 --> 00:25:07.930
but it's curving around on a
big scale.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:13.640
All right, so this marks the
end of one topic.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.048
So I'm going to write down over
and over what we know,

00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:21.558
because I think I talked to
some of you people,

00:25:21.558 --> 00:25:24.413
and I asked you,
what's the part you find

00:25:24.413 --> 00:25:25.269
difficult.
 

00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:28.536
And one thing I heard,
which is very reasonable,

00:25:28.536 --> 00:25:32.079
is the amount of stuff you're
learning every day.

00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:34.538
This is just a lot of stuff.
 

00:25:34.538 --> 00:25:37.487
"Drinking out of the fire
hose" was an expression

00:25:37.487 --> 00:25:38.250
that came up.
 

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:41.445
You drink and you drink and you
drink and I keep throwing stuff

00:25:41.445 --> 00:25:41.910
at you.
 

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.058
I would like it to end.
 

00:25:44.058 --> 00:25:46.808
It's almost going to end,
but it's not over yet.

00:25:46.808 --> 00:25:49.450
But I'll tell you where things
stand now.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.797
All of electrostatics and
magnetostatics are summarized by

00:25:53.797 --> 00:25:55.779
the following equations.
 

00:25:55.779 --> 00:25:59.019
I'm going to write them again
and again.

00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:03.519
EâdA
is the charge inside.

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:05.021
Line integral of
Eâ

00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:06.068
dl.
 

00:26:06.068 --> 00:26:09.880
or dr--I forgot what I
called it--that is 0.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.861
Surface integral of the
magnetic field is 0 because

00:26:12.861 --> 00:26:14.769
there are no magnetic charges.
 

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:20.180
The line integral of the
magnetic field is mu 0 times all

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.210
the current inside.
 

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:23.690
That's it.
 

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.804
And the force--after all,
who cares about E and

00:26:26.804 --> 00:26:29.124
B,
except for this great equation,

00:26:29.124 --> 00:26:31.884
which tells you that if a
charged particle goes into a

00:26:31.884 --> 00:26:34.230
region with electric and
magnetic fields,

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.150
this will be the force acting
on it.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.078
That's very important.
 

00:26:38.078 --> 00:26:40.805
That's why we care about
E and B,

00:26:40.805 --> 00:26:42.818
because they make things
happen.

00:26:42.818 --> 00:26:46.420
So the cycle of physics will
proceed as follows - this is all

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.259
for statics.
 

00:26:47.259 --> 00:26:57.730
That means J is constant
and rho is constant.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.405
So somebody has to give you the
currents and somebody has to

00:27:00.405 --> 00:27:01.450
give you the charges.
 

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.051
Then it's a purely mathematical
problem to solve for the

00:27:04.051 --> 00:27:05.519
electric and magnetic fields.
 

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:09.160
And I was telling you yesterday
a fact that may not be obvious,

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.336
that these equations suffice to
determine electric and magnetic

00:27:13.336 --> 00:27:15.609
fields,
given the cause of electric and

00:27:15.609 --> 00:27:20.690
magnetic fields,
which is currents and charges.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:30.568
Okay, so now we are going to
do--let me ask you something.

00:27:30.568 --> 00:27:33.490
When do we keep on modifying
the equations?

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.309
I think I explained that to you.
 

00:27:35.309 --> 00:27:38.519
Why don't we stop now?
 

00:27:38.519 --> 00:27:42.509
Any idea why I'm going to
modify the stuff?

00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:44.788
Do you know?
 

00:27:44.788 --> 00:27:49.890
Do you know when we modify
equations?

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.579
What could be wrong with this
equation?

00:27:51.579 --> 00:27:55.460
Who can convince me it's wrong?
 

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:59.970
Any idea?
 

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.101
I'm not talking about a
particular thing,

00:28:03.101 --> 00:28:07.563
but I'm talking in general,
what makes people modify their

00:28:07.563 --> 00:28:08.660
equations.
 

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.440
Pardon me?
 

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.420
Student:  New experiment.
 

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.390
Prof: New experiment.
 

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:15.170
That's the only reason you
modify your results.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.807
If these things worked,
and it could have been a very

00:28:17.807 --> 00:28:20.801
consistent world in which it
worked, but it is not the whole

00:28:20.801 --> 00:28:21.308
story.
 

00:28:21.308 --> 00:28:24.083
At least one reason it's not
the whole story is,

00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:26.618
rho and J are not always
constant.

00:28:26.618 --> 00:28:29.803
You can have charges shaking
around and you can have

00:28:29.803 --> 00:28:30.490
currents.
 

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.480
You turn them on and off as you
wish.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.259
One thing is to hope that this
continues to describe them even

00:28:37.259 --> 00:28:38.500
in this situation.
 

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.178
The fact that we derive them
from steady currents and

00:28:41.178 --> 00:28:44.473
densities doesn't mean it has to
fail when they are changing with

00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:47.438
time,
but there is no guarantee that

00:28:47.438 --> 00:28:48.990
they won't change.
 

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:53.997
So I'm going to now lead you
through the experiments that

00:28:53.997 --> 00:28:58.108
forced us to change some of
these equations.

00:28:58.108 --> 00:29:01.535
So these are called Maxwell's
equations, but they're not the

00:29:01.535 --> 00:29:04.554
real Maxwell equations,
because they're not valid for

00:29:04.554 --> 00:29:06.180
the time dependent case.
 

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:10.096
I'm going to start the
phenomenon, then we'll see where

00:29:10.096 --> 00:29:11.618
the trouble begins.
 

00:29:11.618 --> 00:29:21.609
So let's take a problem where I
have a uniform magnetic field

00:29:21.609 --> 00:29:25.440
going into the board.
 

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.172
This goes on forever,
but it doesn't go beyond this

00:29:29.172 --> 00:29:29.769
point.
 

00:29:29.769 --> 00:29:33.288
I've only shown you that much.
 

00:29:33.288 --> 00:29:41.288
Now I'm going to take a loop of
wire like this.

00:29:41.288 --> 00:29:48.250
It's got some width w and maybe
some length l..

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:51.548
And I put a little light bulb
here.

00:29:51.548 --> 00:29:54.847
Then I drag this to the right
with some speed V. And

00:29:54.847 --> 00:30:02.448
this magnetic field
B going into the

00:30:02.448 --> 00:30:05.759
blackboard.
 

00:30:05.759 --> 00:30:08.009
Now if the loop is not moving,
nothing will happen.

00:30:08.009 --> 00:30:13.308
If the loop is moving,
something does happen.

00:30:13.308 --> 00:30:16.798
Now I'm going to ask you what
happens, because this is

00:30:16.798 --> 00:30:18.509
something you must know.
 

00:30:18.509 --> 00:30:19.750
What happens when I drag the
loop?

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.328
Yes?
 

00:30:20.328 --> 00:30:20.950
Student:  The light bulb
will go on.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:21.450
Prof: Good.
 

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:24.798
The light bulb will go on is
the answer that you've got to

00:30:24.798 --> 00:30:25.210
give.
 

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.220
You may not know by how much
and whatnot.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.679
But first of all,
why would I draw a light bulb

00:30:29.679 --> 00:30:31.230
if it's not going to go on?
 

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.220
That's how you should reason.
 

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.190
That's how my kids did all
their SATs.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.368
They asked extraneous questions.
 

00:30:36.368 --> 00:30:39.839
One of them is,
you put the light bulb because

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:41.460
it's going to glow.
 

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.809
So you can ask yourself,
what's going on?

00:30:43.809 --> 00:30:45.309
Why is the light bulb glowing?
 

00:30:45.309 --> 00:30:47.288
Is it some new physics?
 

00:30:47.288 --> 00:30:50.595
The answer is,
whenever youwant a light bulb

00:30:50.595 --> 00:30:53.670
to glow, you're looking for a
battery.

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:56.470
There is no battery in the
circuit.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.078
And yet there is an emf,
because every time a charge

00:31:00.078 --> 00:31:02.910
makes one full turn and comes
around,

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.263
it has delivered some work,
because that's what makes this

00:31:06.263 --> 00:31:07.028
thing glow.
 

00:31:07.028 --> 00:31:09.862
You're constantly pumping
energy into the resistor inside

00:31:09.862 --> 00:31:10.470
your bulb.
 

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:11.720
And who's providing the energy?
 

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.410
These charges are going round
and round doing some work.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:21.400
That means something is pushing
them around this loop.

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.373
We defined the emf to be the
line integral of any force per

00:31:26.373 --> 00:31:30.059
unit charge pushing them around
the loop.

00:31:30.059 --> 00:31:33.390
This is per unit charge.
 

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:40.450
That's got to be not 0.
 

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:45.290
So what is that force,
and what is the emf is what I

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:46.618
want to ask.
 

00:31:46.618 --> 00:31:53.710
Do you know what the force
might be?

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.970
And why does it kick in only
when I move the loop?

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:56.868
Yes?
 

00:31:56.868 --> 00:31:59.785
Student:  The force is
the magnetic force that we

00:31:59.785 --> 00:32:00.210
wrote.
 

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:01.630
Prof: The v x
B force.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.396
That's because there's a
v here,

00:32:03.396 --> 00:32:04.838
B into the blackboard.
 

00:32:04.838 --> 00:32:08.519
v x B looks like
that.

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:12.069
The force is v x
B and it acts only here.

00:32:12.069 --> 00:32:16.130
Let's understand why.
 

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:20.282
If you come to this portion,
if you take this v x

00:32:20.282 --> 00:32:22.393
B,
this v is this way,

00:32:22.393 --> 00:32:24.772
and B is into the board,
v x B is

00:32:24.772 --> 00:32:25.818
perpendicular to the wire.
 

00:32:25.818 --> 00:32:29.347
But charges cannot go--even if
there's a force perpendicular to

00:32:29.347 --> 00:32:32.707
the wire, it doesn't contribute
to the emf, which I found by

00:32:32.707 --> 00:32:34.130
going along the loop.
 

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:36.190
So dr is along the loop.
 

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.151
The only way to get that to
contribute is to have a force

00:32:39.151 --> 00:32:40.048
along the loop.
 

00:32:40.048 --> 00:32:43.368
That's only here and it's not
here.

00:32:43.368 --> 00:32:47.348
So the whole force is non-zero
only in that segment.

00:32:47.348 --> 00:32:52.970
So its line integral is equal
to simply the force,

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:57.099
which is Bv times
w.

00:32:57.099 --> 00:33:00.920
That's the emf.
 

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.247
Any time a charge goes around
the loop once,

00:33:05.247 --> 00:33:08.869
that amount of work is being
done.

00:33:08.869 --> 00:33:10.578
Okay, so that explains it.
 

00:33:10.578 --> 00:33:11.970
We're not in any kind of
trouble.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:15.346
In fact, we understand this
problem completely without

00:33:15.346 --> 00:33:17.130
bringing in any new stuff.
 

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:19.890
But there's one paradox.
 

00:33:19.890 --> 00:33:23.559
We were told the magnetic field
doesn't do any work.

00:33:23.559 --> 00:33:25.278
You remember that?
 

00:33:25.278 --> 00:33:30.316
And yet here is a magnetic
field pushing these charges and

00:33:30.316 --> 00:33:32.259
getting things done.
 

00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:35.368
So what can be going on there?
 

00:33:35.368 --> 00:33:41.279
Student:  It takes work
to move the whole loop.

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:42.538
Prof: It takes work to
move the loop.

00:33:42.538 --> 00:33:45.580
That is certainly true,
but how about the fact that the

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.890
magnetic field manages to do
some work?

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:54.558
Is that a problem for you or
not?

00:33:54.558 --> 00:33:57.701
Remember, the original argument
for why it doesn't do any work

00:33:57.701 --> 00:34:00.854
is, the force is
v x B and the

00:34:00.854 --> 00:34:04.718
power is the velocity times the
force and it's 0,

00:34:04.718 --> 00:34:09.550
because v x B is
perpendicular to v.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.101
But here, v x B
is this way, and the charge is

00:34:12.101 --> 00:34:12.880
moving this way.
 

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:19.670
It looks like we got some work
done.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:24.481
Okay, so the answer is that
this is not the full--there are

00:34:24.481 --> 00:34:26.639
two kinds of velocities.
 

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:31.059
If you have a current in the
wire, the charges are also

00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:34.659
moving in the wire at some speed
u.

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:38.268
So the real velocity has got
the velocity because the whole

00:34:38.268 --> 00:34:40.510
loop is moving,
v, and the fact the

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:43.251
current is moving this way,
u, and w,

00:34:43.251 --> 00:34:47.268
if you like,
is the true velocity.

00:34:47.268 --> 00:34:49.840
And v x B is
actually in that direction.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.119
That is v x B,
perpendicular to w.

00:34:52.119 --> 00:34:54.010
So let me draw the picture for
you.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:35:03.429
w and w x
B.

00:35:03.429 --> 00:35:04.659
w is made up of two
parts.

00:35:04.659 --> 00:35:12.039
It's got a part v here,
it's got a part u here.

00:35:12.039 --> 00:35:13.989
So the magnetic force is not
just along the wire.

00:35:13.989 --> 00:35:17.550
It's really at this strange
angle.

00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:21.750
And we can easily find out how
much of the force is this part

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:24.619
and how much of the force is
this part.

00:35:24.619 --> 00:35:33.170
The force here will be--let me
see.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:37.733
It will depend on the other
component, so it will depend

00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:42.461
on--yes, the force here is
B times v and the

00:35:42.461 --> 00:35:45.199
power is that times u.
 

00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:49.599
The power is Bvu,
due to this portion.

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:52.873
But in this side,
if you ask what's the power

00:35:52.873 --> 00:35:57.112
delivered by that component,
it is B times u

00:35:57.112 --> 00:35:59.940
times v,
but with a - sign.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.657
In other words,
if you resolve this w x

00:36:03.657 --> 00:36:08.456
B into two parts,
the vertical force is due to

00:36:08.456 --> 00:36:12.583
the horizontal velocity,
and the power is that times the

00:36:12.583 --> 00:36:14.159
vertical velocity u.
 

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:16.460
The horizontal force is due to
the vertical velocity.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.159
That's how the cross product
works.

00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:20.023
So when you're done,
both are equal to B

00:36:20.023 --> 00:36:21.320
times u times v.
 

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.768
But this is and this is -.
 

00:36:23.768 --> 00:36:26.244
In other words,
in the end, it would like to

00:36:26.244 --> 00:36:29.121
move the charge this way,
because that's the force,

00:36:29.121 --> 00:36:32.230
but it manages to move it along
the wire this way.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:36.840
It would like to move it this
way, but it's force to go

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.949
oppositely.
 

00:36:37.949 --> 00:36:41.612
So a force trying to move this
way, this part it is doing work,

00:36:41.612 --> 00:36:43.800
but this part it is not doing
work.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.041
It has work done on it,
because we forced the electrons

00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:49.849
to move to the right.
 

00:36:49.849 --> 00:36:54.110
Of course, that energy comes
from the person pulling the rod,

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.175
pulling this loop,
because every charge that has

00:36:57.175 --> 00:36:59.501
this force,
it won't just move unless you

00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:01.498
pull it,
and the force you apply is

00:37:01.498 --> 00:37:04.809
really coming from you that
balances the magnetic force.

00:37:04.809 --> 00:37:06.570
So there's yet another force.
 

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:12.076
That's the force due to me,
and I'm pulling this to balance

00:37:12.076 --> 00:37:14.449
this part of the force.
 

00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:19.679
So what is the role of the
magnetic field?

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:23.463
It doesn't do any work,
but you need it here,

00:37:23.463 --> 00:37:28.280
because one component of the
magnetic field does work.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.110
The other component has work
done on it.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:34.746
So it takes with one hand and
gives with the other hand,

00:37:34.746 --> 00:37:36.070
but you need that.
 

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:38.954
It's no used saying,
"I'm not very impressed

00:37:38.954 --> 00:37:41.360
because I did all the hard
work."

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:45.438
You did all the hard work by
grabbing this loop and pulling

00:37:45.438 --> 00:37:47.213
it,
but I challenge you to go and

00:37:47.213 --> 00:37:50.110
push the individual electrons so
they can move down the wire.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.730
You cannot even see those
little guys, right?

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:55.630
But the magnetic field does
that for you.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:59.237
So it takes macroscopic
mechanical power,

00:37:59.237 --> 00:38:04.469
turns into microscopic energy
supplied to the electrons.

00:38:04.469 --> 00:38:06.909
Even though the field did not
profit in the end,

00:38:06.909 --> 00:38:09.670
it just delivered to the
electrons what you gave them,

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:13.552
you need that field to do a
transfer from something you can

00:38:13.552 --> 00:38:16.500
see and pull to something you
cannot see,

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.909
right?
 

00:38:17.909 --> 00:38:19.900
I mean, I give you a light bulb
and you've got all the muscles

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.389
in your hand.
 

00:38:20.389 --> 00:38:22.670
Let's see you make it glow.
 

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.719
You cannot say,
"I have the energy."

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:26.639
There's no way to transfer it.
 

00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:29.947
That's the role of the magnetic
field, so you shouldn't say it's

00:38:29.947 --> 00:38:30.420
no use.
 

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.710
Anyway, we got that answer.
 

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:37.811
I'm going to give you another
equivalent way to explain the

00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:39.570
balance of energy.
 

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.440
We all know that the energy is
coming,

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.320
because once the loop carries a
current,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.010
it's going to be hard for you
to pull the loop,

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:50.224
so you've got to do some work,
and that will explain the power

00:38:50.224 --> 00:38:50.909
usage here.
 

00:38:50.909 --> 00:38:54.380
So let's calculate the power
two ways.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:39:00.070
The power in the resistor = emf
squared over R.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:13.909
emf squared is
B^(2)v^(2)W^(2)/R.

00:39:13.909 --> 00:39:19.010
Now how about the power that I
provide?

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.719
What's the power I provide?
 

00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:23.389
I'm pulling this leg of the
wire here.

00:39:23.389 --> 00:39:25.873
The force on anything,
you remember,

00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:28.711
is BwI,
and I pull it with a force

00:39:28.711 --> 00:39:31.480
v, with a velocity
v.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.369
That's the power.
 

00:39:35.369 --> 00:39:38.760
So it is Bwv times
I.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.750
I = emf divided by
R.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:48.420
But if you put the emf that we
just got, you will get this.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.880
So they will match.
 

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.199
So do you understand how this
thing works?

00:39:54.199 --> 00:39:56.010
This is a generator,
if you like.

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:58.880
If you want to light the bulb
in your house,

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.679
one option is to set up a
magnetic field,

00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:04.719
take the light bulb and connect
it to a rectangle,

00:40:04.719 --> 00:40:06.920
and grab it and keep running.
 

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.768
As long as you're running,
the light bulb will be glowing.

00:40:11.768 --> 00:40:12.929
When do you think it will stop
glowing?

00:40:12.929 --> 00:40:13.659
Yes?
 

00:40:13.659 --> 00:40:16.309
Student:  I'm sorry,
what does that word say?

00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:18.119
Prof: This one?
 

00:40:18.119 --> 00:40:28.989
The power that I provide.
 

00:40:28.989 --> 00:40:32.440
Okay, I'm just balancing the
power loss in the resistor.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.420
Are you with me now?
 

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.409
You understand the two things?
 

00:40:35.409 --> 00:40:38.550
I take the force I apply on the
wire, multiply by the velocity

00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.579
with which I pull.
 

00:40:39.579 --> 00:40:40.639
That's the power.
 

00:40:40.639 --> 00:40:42.219
Likewise I take I^(2)R.
 

00:40:42.219 --> 00:40:44.059
That's the electric power
dissipated.

00:40:44.059 --> 00:40:47.518
And of course, they balance.
 

00:40:47.518 --> 00:40:54.157
Notice that once the loop is
fully inside the magnetic field,

00:40:54.157 --> 00:40:58.030
the light bulb will stop
glowing.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.400
Do you know why?
 

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.179
Can you see why?
 

00:41:00.179 --> 00:41:00.760
Yes?
 

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.715
Student:  Because the
flux in the loop isn't changing

00:41:02.715 --> 00:41:03.079
any more.
 

00:41:03.079 --> 00:41:03.889
Prof: No, no.
 

00:41:03.889 --> 00:41:07.039
You're pulling new laws,
in terms of what I've told you.

00:41:07.039 --> 00:41:10.713
Student:  The magnetic
field, there's no new field

00:41:10.713 --> 00:41:12.420
coming through the wire.
 

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.630
The field is constant that's
coming through the wire.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:17.369
Prof: Just use what
we've used so far.

00:41:17.369 --> 00:41:19.193
Yes
Student:  The field is

00:41:19.193 --> 00:41:20.030
acting on the left segment.
 

00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.679
Prof: Right.
 

00:41:20.679 --> 00:41:23.351
In other words,
without invoking any new ideas,

00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:26.780
once this piece gets into the
loop, it's going to have a

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:29.800
v x B there and
a v x B there.

00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.489
Which way should the current go?
 

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:34.041
In fact, it won't go anywhere,
because the line integral of

00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:34.789
this will be 0.
 

00:41:34.789 --> 00:41:38.771
You will get contribution from
there, and - the contribution

00:41:38.771 --> 00:41:39.650
from there.
 

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.489
So we can demolish this problem.
 

00:41:42.489 --> 00:41:43.920
You understand it completely.
 

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.610
It doesn't pose any
difficulties.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:51.826
And it does not give any
grounds to monkey with those

00:41:51.826 --> 00:41:53.030
equations.
 

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.820
And now comes the bad news.
 

00:41:56.820 --> 00:42:03.969
Suppose I go to a frame of
reference moving with the loop.

00:42:03.969 --> 00:42:06.880
It may well be that the loop
was just there,

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:11.079
and I hired a couple of guys to
carry a magnet and run under my

00:42:11.079 --> 00:42:12.230
house, right?
 

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.338
And also, my light bulb will
glow, and I don't have to go

00:42:15.338 --> 00:42:15.949
anywhere.
 

00:42:15.949 --> 00:42:18.090
They will carry the magnet.
 

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:22.367
Now you realize that you're
certainly entitled to see it

00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:24.780
from that frame of reference.
 

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.094
Now if you believe in
relativity, that means a person

00:42:27.094 --> 00:42:29.586
should be able to say from the
point of view of the loop,

00:42:29.586 --> 00:42:30.699
"I'm not moving.
 

00:42:30.699 --> 00:42:33.019
Someone's carrying the magnet
and running with it."

00:42:33.019 --> 00:42:35.650
But the light bulb must glow.
 

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.956
Lots of things are relative,
but whether a light bulb is

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.940
glowing or not is not relative.
 

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.760
You can go to any frame of
reference.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:44.809
A glowing light bulb is a
glowing light bulb.

00:42:44.809 --> 00:42:47.949
We don't know how much power it
consumes and so on,

00:42:47.949 --> 00:42:51.340
but the fact that it's on and
glowing is undeniable.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.753
So how is the person in that
fixed loop supposed to

00:42:56.753 --> 00:43:01.409
understand the glowing of the
light bulb?

00:43:01.409 --> 00:43:04.273
What do you do,
what do you say,

00:43:04.273 --> 00:43:06.400
in terms of anything?
 

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.659
Why are charges going around?
 

00:43:07.659 --> 00:43:09.480
I'm a static loop.
 

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.536
Okay, someone's moving with the
magnet, but there's no v

00:43:12.536 --> 00:43:15.199
x B force because
nobody's moving in my loop.

00:43:15.199 --> 00:43:19.550
The magnet's irrelevant.
 

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:21.210
Of course, there's one
difference.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:23.556
This magnet is not like the
usual problem,

00:43:23.556 --> 00:43:25.731
because it's a changing
magnetic field,

00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:28.880
whereas previously you had a
static magnetic field.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.275
So you might say, "Well,
maybe the force on a charge due

00:43:31.275 --> 00:43:34.521
to moving magnetic field is
different from its force due to

00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:36.369
changing magnetic field."
 

00:43:36.369 --> 00:43:39.034
But that's not acceptable,
because if you believe in the

00:43:39.034 --> 00:43:41.458
reality of the field,
what it does at a given point

00:43:41.458 --> 00:43:42.670
depends on its value.
 

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.789
It doesn't depend on anything
else.

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:48.992
But I still haven't explained
why charges like to go around a

00:43:48.992 --> 00:43:49.579
wire now.
 

00:43:49.579 --> 00:43:55.239
So what force could be pushing
them?

00:43:55.239 --> 00:43:58.880
What force do you think will
push them around a loop?

00:43:58.880 --> 00:43:59.760
Yes?
 

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.230
Would you like to guess?
 

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:02.268
Yes, you.
 

00:44:02.268 --> 00:44:08.289
Student: 
&gt;

00:44:08.289 --> 00:44:10.900
Prof: The magnetic field
is changing with time.

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:14.407
You agree that the loop is
going to be fixed,

00:44:14.407 --> 00:44:17.755
and a little later,
it will look like this,

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:19.429
and so on, right?
 

00:44:19.429 --> 00:44:22.038
But that's not going to move
the current around the wire,

00:44:22.038 --> 00:44:25.018
because the magnetic field has
no cross product with anything.

00:44:25.018 --> 00:44:30.373
So what's the only thing that
can make the charges move around

00:44:30.373 --> 00:44:31.690
the wire now?
 

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.150
What made them move in the DC
circuit?

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:34.869
Student:  Electric field.
 

00:44:34.869 --> 00:44:35.659
Prof: Electric field.
 

00:44:35.659 --> 00:44:39.460
Look, I want you to understand
that these equations carry a

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:42.737
large amount of information,
and they in fact carry

00:44:42.737 --> 00:44:45.489
everything as far as you need to
know.

00:44:45.489 --> 00:44:48.775
The only force on a charge is
either E or v x

00:44:48.775 --> 00:44:49.400
B.
 

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.030
That's it.
 

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.130
If v x B is out,
it's E.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:56.789
I mean, there may be brand new
phenomena.

00:44:56.789 --> 00:44:58.440
It turns out that we don't need
anything else.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.159
E and B will do.
 

00:45:01.159 --> 00:45:03.530
In which case,
what are we saying?

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:06.548
We are saying that in the other
frame of reference,

00:45:06.548 --> 00:45:09.447
where the loop is fixed and the
magnet is moving,

00:45:09.447 --> 00:45:11.320
there is an electric field.
 

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:16.594
Not only that,
it's an electric field whose

00:45:16.594 --> 00:45:21.023
line integral is not 0,
because it is still true that

00:45:21.023 --> 00:45:23.550
charges in the loop are going
round and round and doing work,

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.860
and someone's providing work
for every charge that goes

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.630
around the loop.
 

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:30.809
And the emf is the work done on
a unit charge.

00:45:30.809 --> 00:45:36.117
So this makes us believe now
that whenever there's a changing

00:45:36.117 --> 00:45:40.099
magnetic field,
there is an electric field.

00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:44.018
This is an electric field of
brand new origin.

00:45:44.018 --> 00:45:49.065
All the electric fields you
studied before were produced by

00:45:49.065 --> 00:45:51.590
charges, by coulombs force.
 

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.349
This says, without the help of
any charge.

00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:55.929
Charges are nowhere to be found.
 

00:45:55.929 --> 00:45:57.500
They could be infinitely far.
 

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.119
If I change the magnetic field,
I'm going to get an electric

00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:01.610
field.
 

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:04.619
Of course, we have to find out
what is the connection.

00:46:04.619 --> 00:46:06.130
How much electric field do you
get?

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.320
How is it connected to the
magnetic field?

00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:11.452
These are things you have to
deduce and you cannot deduce

00:46:11.452 --> 00:46:12.460
them from logic.
 

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.449
You can deduce them only from
experiment.

00:46:15.449 --> 00:46:16.739
Certain things come from logic.
 

00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:19.099
If you have an equation,
you solve it using mathematics.

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:20.869
If you like,
that's a kind of logic.

00:46:20.869 --> 00:46:24.358
Or you use symmetry and say,
"If I turn the wire and it

00:46:24.358 --> 00:46:26.782
looks the same,
the answer should look the

00:46:26.782 --> 00:46:28.260
same" and so on.
 

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.492
But what electric field should
be produced by changing magnetic

00:46:32.492 --> 00:46:35.360
field you cannot derive from
pure logic.

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.400
If you combine it with other
principles like relativity,

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.340
you could try to get them,
but right now,

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.932
with what we have,
we just know that in the moving

00:46:42.932 --> 00:46:44.630
frame--
look, you don't need Einstein

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:45.389
to tell you this.
 

00:46:45.389 --> 00:46:48.894
Even before Einstein,
you knew that you're certainly

00:46:48.894 --> 00:46:52.813
free to imagine a loop being
fixed and somebody moving the

00:46:52.813 --> 00:46:53.570
magnet.
 

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:57.420
And everything in you tells you
the answer's got to be the same,

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:59.956
because in the end,
it's the relative motion

00:46:59.956 --> 00:47:02.730
between the loop and the magnet
that decides.

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:05.005
And if you provide the same
relative motion,

00:47:05.005 --> 00:47:06.909
you've got to get the same
answer.

00:47:06.909 --> 00:47:09.342
And the only way to get that is
to say when there's a changing

00:47:09.342 --> 00:47:10.989
magnetic field,
I have an electric field,

00:47:10.989 --> 00:47:13.606
and furthermore,
electric field which is no

00:47:13.606 --> 00:47:17.800
longer conservative because its
line integral is not 0.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.699
So we've got to find out what
it is.

00:47:19.699 --> 00:47:23.882
So I'm going to tell you now an
equation that really answers

00:47:23.882 --> 00:47:26.789
that question,
and we cannot derive it.

00:47:26.789 --> 00:47:29.010
It's a summary of a lot of
experiment.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:38.920
And that says that the
electromotive force--

00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:42.760
in fact, due to electric and
magnetic origin,

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:49.829
em = -d
Î¦/dt,

00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:58.699
and I'll tell you what this
equation means.

00:47:58.699 --> 00:48:08.230
So you take a loop,
some contour c,

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:14.480
and you define Î¦
to be equal to the integral of

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:22.230
the magnetic field on a surface
whose boundary is this loop.

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:27.699
That's called the magnetic flux.
 

00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:30.159
So you know operationally how
to calculate it.

00:48:30.159 --> 00:48:32.719
Take any surface you want.
 

00:48:32.719 --> 00:48:35.054
It may be a flat one,
a bulging one,

00:48:35.054 --> 00:48:36.190
doesn't matter.
 

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:40.228
Take the flux going through any
surface with that as the

00:48:40.228 --> 00:48:44.632
boundary, and find its rate of
change, and that will be equal

00:48:44.632 --> 00:48:46.909
to the electromotive force.
 

00:48:46.909 --> 00:48:52.751
In fact, you just write
E electromotive force,

00:48:52.751 --> 00:48:56.909
= -d
Î¦/dt.

00:48:56.909 --> 00:48:59.643
So you know operationally how
to find this thing,

00:48:59.643 --> 00:49:00.099
right?
 

00:49:00.099 --> 00:49:03.855
Now again, you may ask,
"Which surface do you want

00:49:03.855 --> 00:49:06.150
to take for a given loop?"
 

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.556
This flat one or the curvy one
or the one with more bumps in

00:49:08.556 --> 00:49:08.760
it?
 

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.409
The answer is,
again, it does not matter.

00:49:11.409 --> 00:49:12.420
The reason is the same.
 

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:16.005
If you've got some magnetic
lines coming through this guy,

00:49:16.005 --> 00:49:19.465
they also have to come out
through that guy because they

00:49:19.465 --> 00:49:20.409
don't stop.
 

00:49:20.409 --> 00:49:23.510
Magnetic field lines that enter
one surface have to also enter

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:26.610
another one with the same edge,
because they cannot escape.

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:28.210
So you can take any surface you
like.

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.420
So whenever you have these laws
where a surface is invoked,

00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:34.039
and it's ambiguous and not
defined by the perimeter,

00:49:34.039 --> 00:49:36.692
the answer is,
it doesn't matter which

00:49:36.692 --> 00:49:37.409
surface.
 

00:49:37.409 --> 00:49:40.309
The reason is that field lines
don't stop and end,

00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:43.800
therefore whatever enters this
surface has to leave this.

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:47.402
If you had magnetic monopoles,
the lines can enter this and

00:49:47.402 --> 00:49:49.639
terminate on a negative
monopole,

00:49:49.639 --> 00:49:55.079
then of course it won't be
true, but you don't have that.

00:49:55.079 --> 00:49:59.706
Now this - sign has got the
name Lenz attached to it,

00:49:59.706 --> 00:50:02.820
and this thing is called
Faraday.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.789
Faraday and Lenz.
 

00:50:03.789 --> 00:50:08.070
And I will tell you what the -
sign due to Lenz means.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:13.505
Lenz's law tells you that if
you change the magnetic flux in

00:50:13.505 --> 00:50:18.389
a system, there's going to be a
very long sentence.

00:50:18.389 --> 00:50:21.670
If you take the magnetic flux
in a system and it changes,

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:26.420
it will induce an emf which,
if it could drive a current,

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:31.159
will do so in order to fight
that change.

00:50:31.159 --> 00:50:33.690
That's why it's a long
statement.

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:36.367
In other words,
if you had a real circuit and

00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:38.925
you shove it into region of
changing field,

00:50:38.925 --> 00:50:41.360
an emf will start driving a
current.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:44.440
That current itself will
produce its own magnetic field.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.550
Which way will it point?
 

00:50:45.550 --> 00:50:48.413
The answer is,
it will point it such a way as

00:50:48.413 --> 00:50:50.170
to neutralize the change.
 

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:54.449
For example,
if you took a loop and it had

00:50:54.449 --> 00:50:58.818
some flux going through it,
if you tried to increase the

00:50:58.818 --> 00:51:01.500
flux going through it,
it will try to decrease it,

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.659
so the current will flow like
that.

00:51:03.659 --> 00:51:05.954
If you try to decrease the flux
through it, it will try to prop

00:51:05.954 --> 00:51:06.880
it up to its old value.
 

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.050
The current will go like that.
 

00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:11.059
That helps you find the
direction of the current.

00:51:11.059 --> 00:51:15.730
The emf will be such as to
neutralize the change.

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.530
It does not necessarily oppose
the external field,

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.730
the magnetic field.
 

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:21.710
It opposes the change in the
magnetic field.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:23.300
That's what I want you to
understand.

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.603
For example,
suppose I've got lines coming

00:51:26.603 --> 00:51:27.489
out here.
 

00:51:27.489 --> 00:51:31.367
And they get weaker,
namely some source of magnetism

00:51:31.367 --> 00:51:33.268
makes the lines weaker.
 

00:51:33.268 --> 00:51:37.320
Then the current will start
going this way to prop up the

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:39.489
thing back to its old value.
 

00:51:39.489 --> 00:51:41.590
That's what you have to
understand.

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:44.735
That's the meaning of the -
sign and that's going to guide

00:51:44.735 --> 00:51:47.219
us much better than all the
cross products.

00:51:47.219 --> 00:51:50.697
Now I will show you that with
this one law,

00:51:50.697 --> 00:51:53.099
you can explain everything.
 

00:51:53.099 --> 00:51:55.699
In other words,
you can explain the wire,

00:51:55.699 --> 00:51:58.260
the current loop moving in the
magnetic field,

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:01.612
in the laboratory frame,
in which the magnet was at rest

00:52:01.612 --> 00:52:04.346
and the loop was moving,
or in the loop frame,

00:52:04.346 --> 00:52:07.139
where the loop was at rest and
the magnet was moving.

00:52:07.139 --> 00:52:10.829
You can explain everything with
this one great law.

00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:12.619
It's a remarkable law.
 

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:16.018
And you just have to say,
we got it from experiment.

00:52:16.018 --> 00:52:18.630
I'm going to tell you how it
explains everything.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:22.369
So let's go back to this loop.
 

00:52:22.369 --> 00:52:25.340
By the way, some of you gave
that answer, so it was not the

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.110
wrong answer.
 

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:27.920
I mean, I think it's perfectly
valid,

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.126
except that I did not want you
to use something we had not done

00:52:31.126 --> 00:52:32.684
yet,
but from this moment on,

00:52:32.684 --> 00:52:33.730
it's a valid answer.
 

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:36.690
So I'm going to give you the
other explanation.

00:52:36.690 --> 00:52:38.389
So here is my field.
 

00:52:38.389 --> 00:52:45.929
I think I had everybody going
in, right?

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:51.985
Here is the thing-- so I want
you to know what I'm trying to

00:52:51.985 --> 00:52:52.909
do now.
 

00:52:52.909 --> 00:52:57.054
I'm trying to tell you that
this one law will explain the

00:52:57.054 --> 00:53:01.420
loop going through the field in
both frames of reference.

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:03.010
So first I'm going to do the
easy part.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:11.369
When there's a fixed magnetic
field and I'm dragging the loop.

00:53:11.369 --> 00:53:14.418
I'm not going to worry about
and - signs, because I will get

00:53:14.418 --> 00:53:15.349
that in the end.
 

00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:24.929
Let us ask, what is the flux
penetrating this loop?

00:53:24.929 --> 00:53:30.141
Can you see that it's just the
magnetic field times the width

00:53:30.141 --> 00:53:35.179
of the loop times the length of
the loop that is inside?

00:53:35.179 --> 00:53:39.543
Not the whole length,
but the length of the loop that

00:53:39.543 --> 00:53:42.650
is still inside the magnetic
field.

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:44.210
That's a very simple result.
 

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.440
B times A is the
flux.

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.740
Now let's take the time
derivative of this,

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:50.550
dÎ¦/dt.
 

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:53.768
B is not changing,
w is not changing,

00:53:53.768 --> 00:53:58.909
but l is changing,
because when I move the loop,

00:53:58.909 --> 00:54:03.826
the rate of change of l
is just the velocity of the

00:54:03.826 --> 00:54:04.429
loop.
 

00:54:04.429 --> 00:54:11.460
But that's exactly the emf we
got before.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:15.173
Now the only thing is with the
- sign, let's figure out if the

00:54:15.173 --> 00:54:16.268
sign is correct.
 

00:54:16.268 --> 00:54:21.869
This has got magnetic flux
going into the board.

00:54:21.869 --> 00:54:27.789
When you pull the loop to the
right, you've got less magnetic

00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:30.650
field going into the board.
 

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:35.077
Therefore the current should
flow in such a way as to

00:54:35.077 --> 00:54:36.780
continue the flux.
 

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:39.079
So which way should the current
flow?

00:54:39.079 --> 00:54:41.389
So if I'm pulling the loop--I'm
sorry.

00:54:41.389 --> 00:54:46.099
I've got the loop drawn
backwards.

00:54:46.099 --> 00:54:47.079
This is okay too.
 

00:54:47.079 --> 00:54:50.121
Let's take this loop and pull
it to the right with a velocity

00:54:50.121 --> 00:54:50.679
v.
 

00:54:50.679 --> 00:54:56.590
So the flux into the board is
increasing, right?

00:54:56.590 --> 00:55:01.079
So it should produce flux
coming out of the board now to

00:55:01.079 --> 00:55:02.550
compensate that.
 

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:08.659
That means the current has to
flow like this.

00:55:08.659 --> 00:55:09.130
See that?
 

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:11.864
When the current flows like
this, you'll start producing

00:55:11.864 --> 00:55:12.559
upward flux.
 

00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:14.568
In other words,
you're getting more and more

00:55:14.568 --> 00:55:16.530
flux into the loop going into
the board.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.300
To cancel it,
I will produce flux coming out

00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:18.920
of the board.
 

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.840
That's what the loop tells you.
 

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.632
That way you don't have to
worry about all the cross

00:55:23.632 --> 00:55:24.018
products.
 

00:55:24.018 --> 00:55:26.500
At the very end,
you ask what's happening to the

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:26.869
flux?
 

00:55:26.869 --> 00:55:29.050
How do I keep it from changing?
 

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:31.592
And the answer is,
you keep it,

00:55:31.592 --> 00:55:35.322
in this case,
from changing by producing flux

00:55:35.322 --> 00:55:38.119
coming out of the blackboard.
 

00:55:38.119 --> 00:55:40.836
And finally,
remember when the loop is

00:55:40.836 --> 00:55:43.996
entirely inside,
there's going to be no more

00:55:43.996 --> 00:55:47.889
emf, because the flux through it
is not changing.

00:55:47.889 --> 00:55:50.719
Because in the beginning,
as it moves to the right,

00:55:50.719 --> 00:55:53.130
it's gaining more and more flux
from the back end of it,

00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:56.039
but once it's fully in,
it's not getting any more flux,

00:55:56.039 --> 00:55:57.429
so the current will stop
flowing.

00:55:57.429 --> 00:56:02.679
That comes from this argument,
from this way of thinking,

00:56:02.679 --> 00:56:05.865
that
dÎ¦/dt

00:56:05.865 --> 00:56:06.710
is 0.
 

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:11.588
So in other words,
I've given you something that I

00:56:11.588 --> 00:56:13.480
say is a new law.
 

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:17.449
The law says the rate of change
of flux = emf,

00:56:17.449 --> 00:56:19.920
but so far, it doesn't look
very new,

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.340
because everything it gave you,
you were able to get without

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:25.679
this law,
right?

00:56:25.679 --> 00:56:28.230
We managed to understand the
loop completely.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:29.949
So is there any new information
in this?

00:56:29.949 --> 00:56:32.190
And that's what I'm going to
talk about.

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:35.471
The new information's going to
come in when I eventually use it

00:56:35.471 --> 00:56:38.699
to understand the answer in the
moving frame of reference,

00:56:38.699 --> 00:56:41.001
namely, what's the electric
field produced by changing

00:56:41.001 --> 00:56:41.739
magnetic field?
 

00:56:41.739 --> 00:56:43.550
That's also contained in this
one.

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:46.632
But I'm just telling you,
this part of it is a letdown,

00:56:46.632 --> 00:56:48.630
because it's not very
impressive.

00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:51.119
It gave you an emf you can get
from the v x B.

00:56:51.119 --> 00:56:54.619
It is just v x B
all over again.

00:56:54.619 --> 00:56:57.159
But let's see what is new.
 

00:56:57.159 --> 00:57:02.344
To really find what is new,
we have to take this problem

00:57:02.344 --> 00:57:07.059
and apply it to the very general
case of a loop.

00:57:07.059 --> 00:57:10.260
Here is some loop.
 

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:15.389
I'm going to have the loop
actually move in time.

00:57:15.389 --> 00:57:17.380
Take a loop in one shape.
 

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:20.820
A little later,
it's got another shape.

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:23.199
And the magnetic field is free
to change.

00:57:23.199 --> 00:57:25.190
I'm going to take a very
general situation.

00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:28.559
The loop is moving,
field is changing.

00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:32.885
So let's say this surface is
S_1 and a

00:57:32.885 --> 00:57:37.210
little later there's a surface
S_2.

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:40.559
You should imagine this is
stacked on top of this.

00:57:40.559 --> 00:57:47.250
Maybe I should hide that part.
 

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:52.393
Here is this surface,
and it's moved to a new

00:57:52.393 --> 00:57:53.679
location.
 

00:57:53.679 --> 00:57:56.844
Now this surface,
let me call S and let me

00:57:56.844 --> 00:58:00.668
call S Îs and you
will see what I mean by S

00:58:00.668 --> 00:58:01.789
ÎS.
 

00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:09.791
You can build up that surface
by taking this surface and

00:58:09.791 --> 00:58:13.429
gluing to it this edge.
 

00:58:13.429 --> 00:58:15.349
Is that clear or not clear?
 

00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:16.099
Not clear.
 

00:58:16.099 --> 00:58:19.010
Let me take a simpler surface
than this one.

00:58:19.010 --> 00:58:26.018
Here is a surface,
here is another surface.

00:58:26.018 --> 00:58:30.110
So one is a cylinder with the
round sides on the bottom.

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:31.820
The other is the top.
 

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:37.327
Do you agree,
they are both surfaces with the

00:58:37.327 --> 00:58:39.329
same boundary?
 

00:58:39.329 --> 00:58:41.420
Are you with me there?
 

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.809
This top loop can either take
the top of the cylinder as its

00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:47.324
boundary,
or it's a hollow cylinder,

00:58:47.324 --> 00:58:49.920
the curvy side and the flat
bottom,

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:53.610
are also another surface with
the same boundary.

00:58:53.610 --> 00:58:59.719
But I can think of the second
surface as essentially the old

00:58:59.719 --> 00:59:01.789
surface the sides.
 

00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:06.469
So you agree that S' = S
ÎS,

00:59:06.469 --> 00:59:11.425
where delta S is the
stuff you glue on the side to

00:59:11.425 --> 00:59:15.409
the old surface to make up the
new surface.

00:59:15.409 --> 00:59:17.880
Yes or no?
 

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.340
I think the cylinder is the
easiest one.

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:25.106
I tried more ambitiously to
draw this, but here is the

00:59:25.106 --> 00:59:26.739
simpler case.
 

00:59:26.739 --> 00:59:31.170
So now the question is,
what is the rate of change of

00:59:31.170 --> 00:59:33.130
flux in this problem?
 

00:59:33.130 --> 00:59:36.840
So the rate of change of flux
I'm going to find as follows.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:42.246
I'm going to find the flux at
time t Ît - phi at

00:59:42.246 --> 00:59:43.690
time t.
 

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:50.530
That's what I want.
 

00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.744
Now at time t Ît,
my loop is here,

00:59:53.744 --> 00:59:58.413
but I'm going to use,
rather than that surface,

00:59:58.413 --> 01:00:03.416
I'm going to use the old
surface the patch job to make it

01:00:03.416 --> 01:00:05.559
into the new surface.
 

01:00:05.559 --> 01:00:09.590
So therefore,
I want the magnetic field,

01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:15.853
B at t Ît
on the surface S ÎS

01:00:15.853 --> 01:00:19.960
- the integral of the magnetic
field,

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:25.824
dA on the old surface at
time t. This part is

01:00:25.824 --> 01:00:29.768
quite subtle and it took me a
while,

01:00:29.768 --> 01:00:33.704
when I first learned it,
to understand what the point

01:00:33.704 --> 01:00:34.159
was.
 

01:00:34.159 --> 01:00:37.293
See,the surface used to be the
bottom half of the cylinder,

01:00:37.293 --> 01:00:38.320
the bottom plate.
 

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.429
The new surface is the top
plate.

01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:42.097
So natural instinct will be,
let's find

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:44.204
Bâv as
on the top face,

01:00:44.204 --> 01:00:45.960
but we don't want to do it that
way.

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.387
We purposely want to take
another surface with the same

01:00:48.387 --> 01:00:50.050
boundary, because we're allowed
to.

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:52.960
That is the old boundary the
vertical sides.

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.518
That's the main point.
 

01:00:54.518 --> 01:00:56.947
You take the old boundary
because it's going to make it

01:00:56.947 --> 01:00:59.690
easy for you to cancel some of
the stuff with some of this.

01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:00.820
That's why.
 

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.340
So B(t Ît)
âdA,

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:12.744
you can write it as B(t
Ît) â

01:01:12.744 --> 01:01:21.306
dA on S integral
B(t)â

01:01:21.306 --> 01:01:26.539
dA on ÎS.
 

01:01:26.539 --> 01:01:29.380
In other words,
the surface integral is

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.400
changing for two reasons.
 

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.936
The surface itself,
the loop itself around which

01:01:33.936 --> 01:01:36.797
you take the line integral is
changing, and the fields

01:01:36.797 --> 01:01:39.010
themselves may be changing with
time.

01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:40.829
So they can both contribute to
the change.

01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:43.130
And I've broken up into two
parts.

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:47.434
One says take B at time
t Ît on the same

01:01:47.434 --> 01:01:49.485
old surface,
and then take

01:01:49.485 --> 01:01:53.900
BâdA
on the incremental surface,

01:01:53.900 --> 01:02:01.157
and subtract from it
B(t)âdA

01:02:01.157 --> 01:02:04.860
on the old surface.
 

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.840
So do you guys see that?
 

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:09.969
Phi of t Ît
I've written as two parts.

01:02:09.969 --> 01:02:14.528
One is the flux on the lower
face, but at a later time,

01:02:14.528 --> 01:02:17.400
and the flux on the curvy
sides.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:19.896
Now on the curvy side,
you don't have to worry about

01:02:19.896 --> 01:02:22.539
whether it's at a later time or
at an earlier time,

01:02:22.539 --> 01:02:25.730
because ÎS is
first ordered in time.

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:27.369
It's proportional to
Ît,

01:02:27.369 --> 01:02:29.393
and this difference is going to
be proportional to

01:02:29.393 --> 01:02:31.876
Ît,
so you don't have to worry

01:02:31.876 --> 01:02:35.599
about the change in time over an
infinitesimal surface,

01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:39.800
because that's second ordered
in time.

01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:47.070
So now I have to bring all that
stuff over here.

01:02:47.070 --> 01:02:58.737
So I'm going to say the change
in Î¦ = dB/dt times

01:02:58.737 --> 01:03:04.978
dA,
Ît on the old

01:03:04.978 --> 01:03:07.932
surface,
here is the stuff we have to do

01:03:07.932 --> 01:03:08.630
that's extra.
 

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:12.775
So do you understand how I
cancel B(t Ît) â

01:03:12.775 --> 01:03:14.981
B(t),
that's given by the rate of

01:03:14.981 --> 01:03:19.360
change of B with time,
times the change in time?

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.047
You get their contribution only
because B is changing

01:03:22.047 --> 01:03:23.920
with time,
because you're taking the very

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.561
same surface,
as you did the first time,

01:03:26.561 --> 01:03:28.179
but at a later time.
 

01:03:28.179 --> 01:03:30.280
Therefore the difference is due
to the rate of change.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:35.206
But now we have to do the
second part, which is,

01:03:35.206 --> 01:03:40.030
on the surface Îs,
we want to take

01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:43.699
BâdA.
 

01:03:43.699 --> 01:03:48.639
Now what is ÎS?
 

01:03:48.639 --> 01:03:49.219
Let me see.
 

01:03:49.219 --> 01:03:59.219
 
 

01:03:59.219 --> 01:04:00.960
So I will have to draw the
picture like this.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:08.809
So here's one surface,
here's another surface,

01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:14.739
and I've gone from here to
here.

01:04:14.739 --> 01:04:17.074
I've gone from this loop to
this loop in a time

01:04:17.074 --> 01:04:17.989
Ît.
 

01:04:17.989 --> 01:04:23.891
This is my segment of the loop,
and that's the distance,

01:04:23.891 --> 01:04:25.929
vÎt.
 

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:30.501
So the area vector associated
with this section is just

01:04:30.501 --> 01:04:33.719
vÎt x
dl.

01:04:33.719 --> 01:04:38.460
That is the surface area.
 

01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:39.199
You see that?
 

01:04:39.199 --> 01:04:42.047
A parallelogram formed with the
loop size dl here

01:04:42.047 --> 01:04:43.929
and the distance traveled in
dt.

01:04:43.929 --> 01:04:45.789
Area of that is just the cross
product.

01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:55.664
So this = 1 v (I'm going
to put the Îv outside)

01:04:55.664 --> 01:05:03.030
v x
dlâB.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.610
So I'm not going to touch this
expression.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:07.309
I'm going to fiddle with this
for a while.

01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:11.510
Cancel dt everywhere if
you like, divide by dt.

01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:13.610
Forget that and forget that.
 

01:05:13.610 --> 01:05:17.483
Then I get
dÎ¦/dt =

01:05:17.483 --> 01:05:21.909
dB/dt
âdA on the

01:05:21.909 --> 01:05:27.148
surface,
the line integral of v x

01:05:27.148 --> 01:05:31.320
dlâB.
 

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.969
Do you understand the last part
what I did?

01:05:33.969 --> 01:05:37.867
The extra surface that you got
here is made up of little

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:42.121
rectangular tiles with the one
end being dl, other end

01:05:42.121 --> 01:05:43.610
being Bdt.
 

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:46.429
The area vector comes like
that, the magnetic field may

01:05:46.429 --> 01:05:49.500
look like that,
and the dot product of the two

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:53.974
is what I have as the extra flux
coming out of the curvy side of

01:05:53.974 --> 01:05:55.039
the surface.
 

01:05:55.039 --> 01:06:00.052
Now you should know enough
about cross products to know

01:06:00.052 --> 01:06:03.487
that this cross product is the
same as

01:06:03.487 --> 01:06:07.849
dlâB x
v,

01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:09.864
because you can rotate the
factors in an A x

01:06:09.864 --> 01:06:12.405
BâC is
BâC x

01:06:12.405 --> 01:06:13.695
A,
is CâA

01:06:13.695 --> 01:06:14.110
x B.
 

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.389
I've done that once.
 

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:21.802
But then this = - the integral
dl

01:06:21.802 --> 01:06:25.920
âv x
B.

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:30.380
So I'm going to write down what
I have.

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:32.639
What I have is that the rate of
change of flux,

01:06:32.639 --> 01:06:42.860
dÎ¦/dt
= -dB/dt times the area -

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:51.599
integral v x
Bâdl.

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:58.559
I'm sorry, it's d/dt
that.

01:06:58.559 --> 01:07:01.465
Therefore âd
Î¦/dt,

01:07:01.465 --> 01:07:04.070
we'll have a - sign here and a
sign here.

01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:05.599
So just write the formula for
âd

01:07:05.599 --> 01:07:06.469
Î¦/dt.
 

01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:07.960
Put a - on everything here.
 

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.349
This is what I want you to know.
 

01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:12.619
Now you've got to go home and
you have to think about this.

01:07:12.619 --> 01:07:14.929
I don't claim it's easy.
 

01:07:14.929 --> 01:07:16.739
I will also tell you something.
 

01:07:16.739 --> 01:07:18.778
If you really don't want to
know everything,

01:07:18.778 --> 01:07:21.150
you don't have to follow this
particular detail.

01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:22.670
I'm going to tell you what I
get out of this.

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:24.340
That's what you have to know.
 

01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.048
I want to make sure that if you
want to follow everything,

01:07:27.048 --> 01:07:28.190
you're given a chance.
 

01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:35.800
So here's what I get from the
old Faraday and Lenz law.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:39.659
This says that rate of change
of flux has two parts.

01:07:39.659 --> 01:07:41.836
You take a contour and you find
the flux changing through it,

01:07:41.836 --> 01:07:42.599
it's got two parts.
 

01:07:42.599 --> 01:07:48.320
One, because the field itself
is changing over the region.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.389
Second, because the loop itself
is changing.

01:07:52.389 --> 01:07:54.003
And together,
they make these two

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:54.809
contributions.
 

01:07:54.809 --> 01:08:02.911
But emf = - integral of all the
electric forces and the magnetic

01:08:02.911 --> 01:08:04.070
forces.
 

01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:09.735
That's =
-(dB/dt)dA

01:08:09.735 --> 01:08:19.118
integral v x
Bâdl.

01:08:19.118 --> 01:08:21.319
Now here's something very
beautiful to look at.

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:25.582
It says the rate of change of
flux by miracle manages to

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:30.465
measure the line integral of the
electric field and the magnetic

01:08:30.465 --> 01:08:31.238
field.
 

01:08:31.238 --> 01:08:33.439
And the rate of change of flux
contains two parts.

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:37.416
The second part is really the
v x B force that

01:08:37.416 --> 01:08:41.528
comes because the contour itself
is moving, the wire itself is

01:08:41.528 --> 01:08:42.270
moving.
 

01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:46.050
So you balance this term with
this term.

01:08:46.050 --> 01:08:48.845
If this is all you were looking
at, there's nothing new in the

01:08:48.845 --> 01:08:49.350
equation.
 

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:52.422
That's why I said we're not
impressed, because it's just the

01:08:52.422 --> 01:08:53.569
v x B.
 

01:08:53.569 --> 01:08:57.157
But the real beauty is,
when you cancel these terms and

01:08:57.157 --> 01:09:01.671
you look at what it says here,
that says line integral of

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:06.224
Eâdl =
- rate of change of

01:09:06.224 --> 01:09:09.260
BâdA.
 

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:13.297
The meaning of the partial
derivative is that B can

01:09:13.297 --> 01:09:16.273
depend on x,
y, z, and t, but

01:09:16.273 --> 01:09:19.319
this is only due to change in
t.

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:22.793
Only due to change in t
because I did the integral on

01:09:22.793 --> 01:09:25.149
the same surface,
only a little later.

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:33.630
This is called Faraday's law.
 

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:36.328
You can see that because of
Faraday's law,

01:09:36.328 --> 01:09:42.000
one of the four equations I
wrote hidden somewhere here,

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:46.288
in which the line integral of
E is 0 is no longer 0.

01:09:46.288 --> 01:09:50.020
So this finally tells you that
in general,

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:53.009
if you take the line integral
of the electric field around a

01:09:53.009 --> 01:09:55.976
closed loop,
you will not get 0 if the

01:09:55.976 --> 01:09:59.948
magnetic flux through that loop
is changing.

01:09:59.948 --> 01:10:03.372
But this has nothing to do
whatsoever with a real

01:10:03.372 --> 01:10:05.300
conducting loop any more.
 

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.288
See, this formula has a lot to
do with the conducting loop,

01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:10.470
because v is the
velocity of the portion

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:13.770
dl,
as the loop moves through space.

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:15.750
But the loop has been banished
from the two sides.

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:18.840
These equations have nothing to
do with any loop.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.135
They just say take a fixed
contour in space and the line

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:25.729
integral of E on that
contour is the rate of change of

01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:26.270
flux.
 

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:29.337
It's an intrinsic relation
between electric and magnetic

01:10:29.337 --> 01:10:32.238
fields, not having anything to
do with conductors.

01:10:32.238 --> 01:10:35.551
It's a property of E and
B, namely that a changing

01:10:35.551 --> 01:10:37.970
B can produce a
circulating E.

01:10:37.970 --> 01:10:45.000
That's the content of this
equation.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:02.819
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:02.819 --> 00:00:04.992
So Thursday,
last--long ago,

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:08.372
last week,
we began to set the scene for

00:00:08.372 --> 00:00:13.110
this course by talking about the
experience of being a British

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.942
colonist,
and as you remember we talked

00:00:15.942 --> 00:00:19.398
about the connection the
colonists had with England both

00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:22.598
positive and negative;
we talked about their sense of

00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:25.693
England--and particularly
London--as being the sort of the

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:29.060
center of the empire and almost
the center of the universe;

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.810
and we talked about the
colonists' simultaneous concerns

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.901
about maybe not quite being as
good as the people who were at

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.720
that wonderful sophisticated
center of the universe.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.543
And I closed the lecture by
noting that in many ways the

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:48.923
colonists were never as British
as when they began to object and

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:52.886
then ultimately rebel against
their mother country for not

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.780
being given their full rights as
British subjects.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.133
Okay.
 

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:00.735
So if Thursday's lecture was
about how the colonists

00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:04.834
identified with the mother
country, today's lecture sort of

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:06.459
does the opposite.
 

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:09.784
And what I'm going to be
talking about today is the ways

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:13.292
in which the colonists and the
colonies were different from

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:15.590
people back in the mother
country.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.400
Basically, as the title of this
lecture suggests,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.400
I'm going to be talking about
being a British American as

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.489
opposed to being a British
colonist,

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:24.938
which was last week.
 

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:28.720
Now connected with what I
suggested on Thursday,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.217
it's important to note that the
American colonists weren't

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:35.959
necessarily aware of the ways in
which some of their ideas and

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.724
attitudes were different,
or certainly were evolving

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:42.390
differently from those in
England,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.825
and I'll come back to this
again in this lecture but I'll

00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:45.610
mention it here.
 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.376
By the mid-eighteenth century,
the period that we're really

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:51.141
talking about now,
there had already been several

00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.610
generations of colonists in the
colonies.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.866
So certainly there were people
in the colonies who themselves

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.812
had never been to England,
perhaps they didn't know very

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:01.608
many people who had been to
England,

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:05.590
and so they didn't necessarily
have an amazingly accurate sense

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.568
of really what it meant to be a
British subject in England,

00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:12.232
living in England proper,
as opposed to their experience

00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:13.538
of being in the colonies.
 

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:16.120
And that's going to be an
important thing to think about

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.810
as we continue on in this
course,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.991
this idea that ideas are
evolving differently in the

00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:23.800
colonies than they're evolving
in England,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.127
and the colonists didn't
necessarily realize that these

00:02:28.127 --> 00:02:29.889
differences existed.
 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:30.335
Okay.
 

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:35.950
So I want to begin this lecture
on being a British American with

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.160
just a handful of examples and
--

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.271
really, kinds of snapshots of
life in the colonies in the

00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:43.860
1740s.
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.419
And as you'll see with these
little examples,

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.010
they're going to each be
demonstrating something that I'm

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.139
going to come back to later in
the lecture,

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.577
but I at least wanted to give
you sort of a sense of what it

00:02:53.577 --> 00:02:55.560
looked like before I actually
talked about it.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.669
And I've pulled all of these
examples--

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.419
there's three or four of
them--all from the same source,

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.521
which is from a really
well-known diary by a

00:03:02.521 --> 00:03:04.468
Dr. Alexander Hamilton.
 

00:03:04.468 --> 00:03:06.030
And this is not the Alexander
Hamilton.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.574
I always feel bad for this guy
because [laughter]

00:03:08.574 --> 00:03:12.020
he's gone down to posterity as
not the real Alexander Hamilton.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.008
[laughter]
He's the not real--he's the

00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:16.526
unknown,
unimportant Alexander Hamilton,

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.483
poor guy--
who lived in Maryland as a

00:03:18.483 --> 00:03:21.520
doctor, and actually he does
have a really interesting diary.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.290
I'll be reading a couple of
sections from it,

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.441
but he's not the founder,
tough break for Alexander

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:28.258
Hamilton.
 

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:28.677
Okay.
 

00:03:28.677 --> 00:03:33.694
So in 1744, he decided to take
a trip north from Maryland for

00:03:33.694 --> 00:03:36.297
his health,
and that's when he keeps this

00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:39.205
sort of a travel diary,
and in it he recorded his

00:03:39.205 --> 00:03:41.720
observations with a lot of
detail,

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.119
as you'll hear,
that show a lot about habits of

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:46.780
behavior and thought in the
colonies or certain--

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.240
and they also will show a lot,
as you'll see,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.581
about Mr. Hamilton,
but also they sort of show you

00:03:52.581 --> 00:03:56.811
what he saw through the lens of
him--but still they'll give you

00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:58.788
a sense of some trends.
 

00:03:58.788 --> 00:03:59.157
Okay.
 

00:03:59.157 --> 00:04:02.754
And I'll--Actually,
I'll add here one little brief

00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:04.789
point,
and that is I'm--in a sense

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:07.727
this is touching on something
that I'm going to be focusing on

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.211
in Thursday's lecture--
and that's the idea that to

00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:13.738
many people--
and you'll hear it sort of

00:04:13.738 --> 00:04:15.580
underlying what he's saying
here--

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.233
to many people,
their individual colony really

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:20.829
was what felt to them like their
country,

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.627
and people often referred
to--Jefferson called Virginia

00:04:23.627 --> 00:04:26.009
"my country"
well into the 1790s,

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.689
if not beyond.
 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:31.440
So you'll be hearing how people
really feel about their colony

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.839
versus those other foreign
colonies,

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.728
that people often felt as
though they were different

00:04:36.728 --> 00:04:40.069
countries with strange habits
and weird speech patterns,

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:43.127
so you'll kind of hear that,
beneath what I'm going to read

00:04:43.127 --> 00:04:44.129
here by Hamilton.
 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.521
Okay.
 

00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:48.916
So one thing that Hamilton
wrote about in his diary shows

00:04:48.916 --> 00:04:51.819
the impact of the Great
Awakening.

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.279
During the time that he was
traveling,

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.831
which is the 1740s,
the colonies were actually

00:04:56.831 --> 00:04:59.440
right in the middle of the Great
Awakening,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.519
which was this really vast
religious revival that really

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:05.596
swept through the colonies,
and in the course of Hamilton's

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:08.165
travels he said he could always
tell when he came across a

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:10.913
revivalist because they always
had a really dour expression on

00:05:10.913 --> 00:05:13.663
their face as though they were
just about to ask you to repent

00:05:13.663 --> 00:05:14.610
for your sins.
 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.389
So he says at one point he came
across one of these revivalists.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.050
He said the fellow was named
Mr. Thomas Quiet and,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.004
as Hamilton put it in his
diary: "This fellow I

00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:27.730
observed had a particular
down-hanging look,

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.113
which made me suspect"
that he is one of the

00:05:30.113 --> 00:05:30.810
revivalists.
 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.596
"I guessed right,
for he introduced a

00:05:32.596 --> 00:05:34.690
discourse"
concerning George Whitefield,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.629
who is the renowned preacher of
the Great Awakening.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.139
He traveled throughout the
colonies preaching,

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.430
and in a lot of ways he was
sort of the guiding force behind

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.440
this Great Awakening in America.
 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.252
So Mr. Thomas Quiet
"enlarged pretty much and

00:05:48.252 --> 00:05:51.178
with some warmth upon the
doctrines of that apostle,

00:05:51.178 --> 00:05:53.129
speaking much in his praise.
 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.233
I took upon me,
in a ludicrous manner,

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:57.509
to impugn some of his
doctrines."

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.353
Charming: he was like 'oh,
well, since this means a lot to

00:06:00.353 --> 00:06:02.000
him, I'll just make fun of it.'
 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.100
"Which by degrees put
Mr. Quiet in a passion."

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.100
So--and he successfully upsets
Mr. Quiet.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.184
"He told me flatly that I
was damned without

00:06:09.184 --> 00:06:10.009
redemption."
 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:12.550
[laughter]
A really fun conversation.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.375
"I replied that I thought
his name and behavior were very

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:17.687
incongruous,
and desired him to change it

00:06:17.687 --> 00:06:19.122
with all speed,
[laughter]

00:06:19.122 --> 00:06:21.793
for it was very improper that
such an angry turbulent mortal

00:06:21.793 --> 00:06:24.509
as he should be called by the
name of Thomas Quiet."

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:24.709
Okay.
 

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:26.540
This tells you a lot about
Alexander [laughter]

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.019
Hamilton.
 

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:29.807
It just--As you'll hear,
he doesn't sound like a really

00:06:29.807 --> 00:06:32.072
charming fellow,
but certainly that passage

00:06:32.072 --> 00:06:35.033
gives you a sense of the sort of
religiosity that marked this

00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:36.069
particular period.
 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:36.447
Okay.
 

00:06:36.447 --> 00:06:39.848
So sometime later,
Hamilton met three men from

00:06:39.848 --> 00:06:44.533
Pennsylvania and he decided he
was going to treat them to punch

00:06:44.533 --> 00:06:46.649
in an off-roads tavern.
 

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:48.475
Now to Hamilton,
as you'll hear,

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:51.831
clearly these three men were
not gentlemen or certainly he

00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:54.129
assumed that they were beneath
him.

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:56.564
As he noted in his diary:
One of them seemed to have to

00:06:56.564 --> 00:06:58.411
think really,
really hard about every word

00:06:58.411 --> 00:06:59.810
that came out of his mouth.
 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.949
One of them was "profuse
in compliments,

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:05.399
which were generally blunt,
and came out in an awkward

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:07.250
manner,"
and the third one was a

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.591
"very roughspun, forward,
clownish blade,

00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:12.838
much addicted to swearing,
at the same time desirous to

00:07:12.838 --> 00:07:15.841
pass for a gentleman,
notwithstanding which ambition,

00:07:15.841 --> 00:07:19.290
the conscientiousness of his
natural boorishness obliged him

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.089
frequently to frame ill-timed
apologies for his misbehaviour,

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:24.930
which he termed frankness and
freeness.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.603
It was often,"
quote, "Damn me,

00:07:27.603 --> 00:07:30.259
gentlemen, excuse me;
I am a plain, honest fellow;

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:32.113
all is right down
plain-dealing,

00:07:32.113 --> 00:07:33.009
by God."
 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:36.249
So he manages to apologize and
swear in the same sentence,

00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:37.670
which is pretty tricky.
 

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.190
Now that fellow --that Hamilton
refers to as the sort of odd

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.959
cursing fellow--
went on to curse Sir Robert

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:45.081
Walpole,
who was a recent British Prime

00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:46.213
Minister,
as a rascal,

00:07:46.213 --> 00:07:48.966
and as Hamilton put it:
"We asked him his reasons

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:51.928
for cursing Sir Robert but he
would give us no other"

00:07:51.928 --> 00:07:54.065
than this,
"that he was certainly

00:07:54.065 --> 00:07:56.675
informed by some very good
gentlemen who understood the

00:07:56.675 --> 00:07:59.755
thing right well,
that the said Sir Robert was a

00:07:59.755 --> 00:08:02.028
damn rogue,"
so he must be.

00:08:02.028 --> 00:08:04.009
[laughs]
'Well, important gentlemen have

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:05.939
told me he was and thus he must
be,

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:08.449
and I will now quote it to
anyone I meet in random taverns

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:09.639
by the side of the road.'
 

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:12.774
So here you see three average
people trying clearly,

00:08:12.774 --> 00:08:15.970
or at least to Hamilton,
trying clearly to impress or

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.629
please him in some way.
 

00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:21.033
Clearly, he is sort of snarkily
feeling as though he's above

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.420
them in social status.
 

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.040
His tavern companions feel a
little bit awkward.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.098
They're apologizing all the
time and saying,

00:08:27.098 --> 00:08:29.684
'Well, I'm just a plain
speaker,' all of which Hamilton

00:08:29.684 --> 00:08:30.930
clearly finds amusing.
 

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.889
And this anecdote suggests two
things.

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:36.043
First it shows people of
different social ranks obviously

00:08:36.043 --> 00:08:38.124
socializing,
and shows several,

00:08:38.124 --> 00:08:42.168
well, what Hamilton would have
considered common folk trying

00:08:42.168 --> 00:08:44.330
to,
in his mind, pass for gentlemen.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.686
But second, you see a group of
people who all perceive

00:08:47.686 --> 00:08:50.029
differences in status on all
sides.

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.056
So they're hanging out
together, but they also

00:08:52.056 --> 00:08:54.668
understand that there's a little
bit of a difference that's

00:08:54.668 --> 00:08:56.379
making them feel somewhat
awkward.

00:08:56.379 --> 00:08:56.672
Okay.
 

00:08:56.672 --> 00:08:59.597
So at another tavern--So
Hamilton's going tavern to

00:08:59.597 --> 00:09:02.288
tavern I guess in this portion
of the trip.

00:09:02.288 --> 00:09:05.278
At another tavern he said he
dined "with a very mixed

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.639
company of different nations and
religions.

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:09.394
There were Scots,
English, Dutch,

00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:10.710
Germans,"
Irish,

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.500
"Roman Catholicks,
Churchmen,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.100
Presbyterians,
Quakers, Newlightmen,

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.970
Methodists, Seventhdaymen,
Moravians,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.870
Anabaptists, and one Jew."
 

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.211
[laughter]
I like the fact that he counted

00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:21.070
that one guy.
 

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.158
So obviously here you see
diversity,

00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:27.519
great diversity of all
kinds--religious diversity,

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:31.068
ethnic diversity--which also
represents something that was

00:09:31.068 --> 00:09:33.808
typical of the colonies in a
general way,

00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:36.029
though more in some places than
in others.

00:09:36.029 --> 00:09:38.769
And actually Pennsylvania,
which is where I think he is at

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:41.413
this point, was known at the
time for being particularly

00:09:41.413 --> 00:09:41.990
diverse.
 

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.600
One last anecdote.
 

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.523
So at one point he--Hamilton
says he ended up in a

00:09:46.523 --> 00:09:49.505
conversation with some
Pennsylvanians about how low

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:52.490
Maryland was in comparison with
Pennsylvania,

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:54.450
which clearly was a much better
colony.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.615
As Hamilton put it,
the Pennsylvanians

00:09:56.615 --> 00:09:58.840
"enlarged upon the
immorality,

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.427
drunkenness,
rudeness, and immoderate

00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:04.059
swearing,
so much practiced in Maryland,

00:10:04.059 --> 00:10:06.835
and added that no such vices
were to be found in

00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:07.778
Pennsylvania.
 

00:10:07.778 --> 00:10:11.015
I heard this and contradicted
it not, because I knew that the

00:10:11.015 --> 00:10:13.928
first part of the proposition
was pretty true."

00:10:13.928 --> 00:10:16.672
He's like, [laughs]
'yeah, we are drunk and we do

00:10:16.672 --> 00:10:19.529
swear a lot and we're rude in
Maryland so, okay.

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:20.879
I think that's true.'
 

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:23.010
[laughter]
"But what appeared most

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.207
comical in their criticism was
their making a merit of the

00:10:26.207 --> 00:10:28.058
stoniness of the roads."
 

00:10:28.058 --> 00:10:30.327
As one put it:
"'One may ride ...

00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:33.883
fifty miles in Maryland and not
see as many stones upon the

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.009
roads as fifty paces of roads in
Pennsylvania.'

00:10:37.009 --> 00:10:40.062
This I knew to be false,
but as I thought there was no

00:10:40.062 --> 00:10:41.791
advantage in stony roads,
I ...

00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.325
let them take the honour of it
to themselves,

00:10:44.325 --> 00:10:46.629
and did not contradict
them."

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:48.779
Now to me, one of the
interesting things about this

00:10:48.779 --> 00:10:51.144
anecdote: It makes me think
about almost a century later

00:10:51.144 --> 00:10:53.080
when we're talking about de
Tocqueville,

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.000
and he's wandering around
America talking with random

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.735
Americans,
and one of the things that

00:10:56.735 --> 00:10:59.730
drives him a little bit nuts is
that no matter what American he

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.307
talks to,
no matter where he is,

00:11:01.307 --> 00:11:03.633
the American always tells him
how everything is best in

00:11:03.633 --> 00:11:05.176
America,
better than anywhere else in

00:11:05.176 --> 00:11:05.580
the world.
 

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.227
So what Tocqueville is
witnessing in the middle of

00:11:09.227 --> 00:11:10.846
the--
towards the middle of the

00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:12.558
nineteenth century is national
pride,

00:11:12.558 --> 00:11:14.678
and what you're seeing here is
a close equivalent,

00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:17.778
but obviously it's colonial
pride.

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:20.269
It's pride in your own
individual colony.

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:23.200
And in a sense,
again, it's a reminder that

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.690
people are seeing their colony
as their country.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.043
So in all of these
little--these snapshots,

00:11:29.043 --> 00:11:32.240
these anecdotes--we've seen a
few things about life in the

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:32.970
colonies.
 

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.678
We've seen religiosity and the
impact of the Great Awakening;

00:11:36.678 --> 00:11:40.556
we've seen diversity of all
types, sometimes at one dinner

00:11:40.556 --> 00:11:43.850
table;
we've seen a middling society;

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.240
and we've seen how people saw
their own colony as their own

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.690
country and in a sense other
colonies as other countries.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.495
To varying degrees in all of
the colonies,

00:11:53.495 --> 00:11:56.370
all of these things were
characteristic.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:00.129
So with that introduction,
I want to turn now to really

00:12:00.129 --> 00:12:04.100
look at what was different about
the American colonies.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.538
Why were people here different?
 

00:12:06.538 --> 00:12:09.662
Why was life here different
from what it would have been

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.330
like to be a British subject
back in England?

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.559
So that's going to be what I
mainly address for the rest of

00:12:15.559 --> 00:12:18.735
the lecture, and I'm going to
talk about it by focusing on

00:12:18.735 --> 00:12:20.240
three different points.
 

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.793
Point number one:
I'm going to talk a little bit

00:12:22.793 --> 00:12:26.054
about the distinctive character
of the people who migrated to

00:12:26.054 --> 00:12:26.980
the colonies.
 

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.889
It gives you such a sense of
power when you're lecturing and

00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:32.543
you say,
"There are three

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:34.212
reasons"
and the entire room goes:

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:34.873
"Oh."
 

00:12:34.873 --> 00:12:36.059
[laughter]
"Three.

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:37.440
There are three."
 

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.860
So there are three.
 

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.264
So number one is the
distinctive character of the

00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:43.168
people who migrated to the
colonies.

00:12:43.168 --> 00:12:46.559
Number two is the distinctive
conditions of life in British

00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:50.009
America,--and that point I'll
talk about for the longest.

00:12:50.009 --> 00:12:53.735
And then number three is the
nature of British colonial

00:12:53.735 --> 00:12:54.908
administration.
 

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:57.322
And I'll repeat that:
the distinctive character of

00:12:57.322 --> 00:12:59.440
the people who migrated to the
colonies,

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.048
the distinctive conditions of
life in British North America,

00:13:02.048 --> 00:13:05.740
and the nature of British
colonial administration.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.412
So let's start off first by
looking at that first category

00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:10.979
of difference,
the character of the people who

00:13:10.979 --> 00:13:13.529
migrated to the colonies--
and, as you'll see,

00:13:13.529 --> 00:13:16.508
in some ways a distinctive kind
of person migrated to the

00:13:16.508 --> 00:13:18.735
colonies--
or at least tended to--in ways

00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:20.269
that will make perfect sense.
 

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:23.851
So for one thing--and in a way
this sounds obvious once you

00:13:23.851 --> 00:13:27.370
think about it--people who
migrated to the colonies tended

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.730
to be risk-takers.
 

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.860
These were people who were
willing to take a risk.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.682
They were willing to make the
hazardous passage across the

00:13:34.682 --> 00:13:36.678
sea,
put themselves at a distance of

00:13:36.678 --> 00:13:39.658
several months' travel from
everything that they knew,

00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:43.226
and start life anew in what
they assumed to be some kind of

00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:44.149
a wilderness.
 

00:13:44.149 --> 00:13:47.798
They were people who wanted
something, maybe to better their

00:13:47.798 --> 00:13:51.261
condition, and they weren't
afraid to act on that desire,

00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:52.500
to reach for it.
 

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.335
Obviously, these are people who
are going to be pretty

00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:58.653
independent and they were often
people who didn't simply accept

00:13:58.653 --> 00:13:59.668
the status quo.
 

00:13:59.668 --> 00:14:01.980
Now all of these are really
big, broad generalizations,

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.977
but as big and broad as they
are, you can see in a general

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:07.923
sense that people who are
deciding to migrate in this way

00:14:07.923 --> 00:14:09.558
--
certainly, many of them would

00:14:09.558 --> 00:14:12.200
have shared some of these
characteristics to some degree.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.820
And, as we're going to see in
the next few weeks,

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:19.009
in a general way this spirit
ran through all of the colonies,

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:22.081
this sort of sense of really
being willing to push for what

00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:22.769
you wanted.
 

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:24.582
In the Old World,
naturally enough,

00:14:24.582 --> 00:14:26.450
things were more
tradition-bound.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.105
In the New World,
just by deciding to go to the

00:14:30.105 --> 00:14:32.855
colonies,
you were already breaking with

00:14:32.855 --> 00:14:35.851
tradition and behaving
differently from the average

00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:36.990
British subject.
 

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:41.029
So if you put this different
sort of person in a different

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:43.724
kind of environment,
as in the colonies,

00:14:43.724 --> 00:14:46.972
you begin to understand the
slow creation of something that

00:14:46.972 --> 00:14:50.668
ends up being a kind of colonial
American mindset or mentality.

00:14:50.668 --> 00:14:55.115
And this brings us to my second
category of differences in the

00:14:55.115 --> 00:14:58.323
colonies, which is:
the conditions of life in

00:14:58.323 --> 00:15:00.220
British North America.
 

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.570
You have a different kind of
person.

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.162
Now you're putting them in a
different kind of living

00:15:04.162 --> 00:15:05.836
situation--
and there were a number of

00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:08.046
things that were different about
living conditions in the

00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:08.519
colonies.
 

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:13.610
First, as I mentioned last
time, more people owned land in

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.950
the colonies.
 

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.956
There was a lot of land,
"empty land,"

00:15:16.956 --> 00:15:19.836
some of it actually empty land,
some of it land owned by

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:23.046
Indians that people considered
to be "empty,"

00:15:23.046 --> 00:15:26.316
but there was more land that
was certainly accessible to

00:15:26.316 --> 00:15:28.100
settlers in the colonies.
 

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.965
So these risk-taking types who
came to the colonies could get

00:15:31.965 --> 00:15:35.702
land and set up their own farms
a lot more easily than they

00:15:35.702 --> 00:15:39.409
could in England,
which gave more people a more

00:15:39.409 --> 00:15:42.570
independent lifestyle in the
colonies,

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.524
and a sense meant they could be
and maybe were raising

00:15:45.524 --> 00:15:48.980
themselves up in the world in a
way that might not have been as

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:50.710
easy to do back in England.
 

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:55.745
A second difference in living
conditions involved voting and

00:15:55.745 --> 00:16:00.147
political participation,
because logically enough and

00:16:00.147 --> 00:16:03.572
generally speaking,
landholding and the vote went

00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:06.452
hand in hand,
the idea being in the colonies

00:16:06.452 --> 00:16:10.493
that you should only let people
vote who were really invested in

00:16:10.493 --> 00:16:13.277
a community,
and landholders are pretty

00:16:13.277 --> 00:16:16.048
literally invested in their
communities.

00:16:16.048 --> 00:16:20.321
So in the colonies where you
have a lot--a much larger number

00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:23.596
of landholders,
you have a much wider franchise

00:16:23.596 --> 00:16:25.019
than in England.
 

00:16:25.019 --> 00:16:28.628
So an example of that:
In the 1760s in England,

00:16:28.628 --> 00:16:32.629
roughly twenty percent of white
men had the vote.

00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:35.792
In the colonies,
roughly sixty to eighty percent

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:39.090
of white men had the vote
depending on the colony,

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.580
which is a pretty big
difference.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:46.032
And that one fact alone
represents a big shift in

00:16:46.032 --> 00:16:46.960
mindset.
 

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.620
In the colonies you had lots of
landholders who knew that they

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:53.798
had the right to be directly
involved in the political

00:16:53.798 --> 00:16:54.519
process.
 

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:57.760
Equally important,
not only were more people able

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.528
to be active in the political
process,

00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:03.200
but the process in which they
were taking part was really

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.507
localized,
so people felt able to

00:17:05.507 --> 00:17:08.269
understand and effect that
process.

00:17:08.269 --> 00:17:11.578
A lot of times you knew--or at
least perhaps had met--

00:17:11.578 --> 00:17:14.380
many of the people that held
government offices--

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.180
and elections could be won or
lost by just a handful of votes.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.868
Now when I first taught this
course,

00:17:20.868 --> 00:17:23.180
that always used to be an
amazing fact,

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.884
'well, an election could be
lost by a handful of votes,' and

00:17:25.884 --> 00:17:28.358
somehow in the last ten years
that doesn't seem amazing

00:17:28.358 --> 00:17:28.910
anymore.
 

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.509
[laughs]
We do that all the time now.

00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:32.740
I don't know why that happens.
 

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:32.961
Okay.
 

00:17:32.961 --> 00:17:35.567
So I want to look for just a
couple of minutes at how voting

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:38.589
actually worked in the colonies,
and it varies from colony to

00:17:38.589 --> 00:17:40.361
colony,
so again I'm talking in a

00:17:40.361 --> 00:17:41.828
general kind of a way here.
 

00:17:41.828 --> 00:17:44.086
Elections first of all --and
this is generally true in all of

00:17:44.086 --> 00:17:46.423
the colonies--
they had to take place over the

00:17:46.423 --> 00:17:48.997
course of a few days,
because people were often

00:17:48.997 --> 00:17:51.880
traveling from very far away to
get to a polling place.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.534
And once they got there,
because it was such a big deal

00:17:54.534 --> 00:17:56.500
for people to get to a polling
place,

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.880
they generally discovered what
in essence was a kind of a fair.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.170
Election Day was a big sort of
celebration day.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.470
There were a lot of people
mulling about.

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:05.589
There was a lot happening.
 

00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:07.358
There was a lot of alcohol.
 

00:18:07.358 --> 00:18:10.019
The alcohol was provided by the
candidates.

00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:10.932
[laughter]
'Here.

00:18:10.932 --> 00:18:12.299
You must vote for me.'
 

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:14.190
[laughs] 'Have another.'
 

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.160
And the candidates themselves
would have been present,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.682
helping to pour,
and mingling with prospective

00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:20.298
voters.
 

00:18:20.298 --> 00:18:23.180
Now a couple of years ago--I
knew this fact for myself.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.566
I hadn't ever sort of thought
about how it played out,

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:27.998
and then a couple of years ago
I was researching in the

00:18:27.998 --> 00:18:29.440
Virginia Historical Society.
 

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.970
I was of course looking for
something else,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.189
but what I came across was a
bunch of documents that clearly

00:18:34.189 --> 00:18:37.298
involved some kind of legal
dispute that broke out because

00:18:37.298 --> 00:18:40.410
of a problem on one of the
election days in Virginia.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.240
And apparently what happened
was, the brother of one of the

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.608
candidates showed up with a pack
of his friends,

00:18:47.608 --> 00:18:50.057
drank a lot,
got really drunk and then stood

00:18:50.057 --> 00:18:53.417
at the door of the polling place
with guns and threatened to

00:18:53.417 --> 00:18:57.006
shoot anyone who didn't vote for
the brother of the guy standing

00:18:57.006 --> 00:18:57.690
there.
 

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.226
[laughter]
'Don't vote for my brother,

00:19:00.226 --> 00:19:00.980
you die.'
 

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:03.769
A strong persuasive component.
 

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:06.278
So obviously,
at least in that election,

00:19:06.278 --> 00:19:07.714
you had drinking,
celebrating,

00:19:07.714 --> 00:19:09.747
and guns,
which is a bad combination,

00:19:09.747 --> 00:19:12.708
[laughter]--
but elections were really kind

00:19:12.708 --> 00:19:14.220
of rowdy occasions.
 

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.039
Now what that kind of hints of,
that sort of 'door persuasion,'

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:19.007
is that actually,
once you went in to the polling

00:19:19.007 --> 00:19:21.205
place,
assuming that you weren't shot

00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:24.410
first,
there were no secret ballots.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.288
You actually stepped to the
front of the room,

00:19:27.288 --> 00:19:29.589
there usually was a table,
at the table were sitting the

00:19:29.589 --> 00:19:31.180
candidates and maybe some
official,

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.980
perhaps a local sheriff,
and you declared who you voted

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.038
for in front of everybody and in
front of the candidates.

00:19:37.038 --> 00:19:41.301
So one example actually from a
document from the time period:

00:19:41.301 --> 00:19:44.428
We're in Virginia and one
voter, a Mr. Blair,

00:19:44.428 --> 00:19:48.618
came forward to this table in
the front of the room,

00:19:48.618 --> 00:19:49.608
a candidate on each side of the
table,

00:19:49.608 --> 00:19:51.588
the sheriff in the middle,
and the sheriff says,

00:19:51.588 --> 00:19:53.068
"Sir, who do you vote
for?"

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:55.712
and Mr. Blair says,
"Mr. Marshall,"

00:19:55.712 --> 00:19:59.136
and Mr. Marshall responds,
"Your vote is appreciated,

00:19:59.136 --> 00:20:00.819
Mr. Blair."
 

00:20:00.819 --> 00:20:02.308
It's a very personal exchange.
 

00:20:02.308 --> 00:20:03.856
The next voter,
a Mr. Buchanan,

00:20:03.856 --> 00:20:06.694
is asked the same question and
he says that he votes for

00:20:06.694 --> 00:20:09.584
Mr. Clapton and Mr. Clapton
responds, "Mr. Buchanan,

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:12.368
I shall treasure that vote in
my memory.

00:20:12.368 --> 00:20:15.670
It will be regarded as a
feather in my cap forever."

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.654
[laughter]
That's such a politician,

00:20:17.654 --> 00:20:18.789
[laughs]
Isn't it?

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:20.440
Already you can hear.
 

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:23.419
So obviously this is a very
personal process in which

00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:27.028
certainly you could feel some
pressure to vote a certain way.

00:20:27.028 --> 00:20:29.733
It's actually a surprisingly
long period of time before

00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:32.538
people figure out that maybe
ballots are a great idea;

00:20:32.538 --> 00:20:34.808
maybe voting in person is not
so good.

00:20:34.808 --> 00:20:35.192
Okay.
 

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:38.792
So you've got more land holding
in the colonies,

00:20:38.792 --> 00:20:42.930
which leads to a broader
franchise in the colonies.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.701
You have voters taking part in
a very localized,

00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:47.470
immediate political process.
 

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:51.167
Another significant difference
in colonial conditions of life

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:54.497
connects with something that I
had mentioned briefly on

00:20:54.497 --> 00:20:57.202
Thursday,
and that's the nature of the

00:20:57.202 --> 00:20:58.980
colonial social structure.
 

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.436
As I mentioned last week,
you did have an elite in the

00:21:02.436 --> 00:21:06.415
colonies, but the proportions of
elite and laboring people was

00:21:06.415 --> 00:21:07.328
different.
 

00:21:07.328 --> 00:21:10.771
In England, half of the
population roughly was of the

00:21:10.771 --> 00:21:13.817
laboring class,
people who did not own land and

00:21:13.817 --> 00:21:15.338
labored for others.
 

00:21:15.338 --> 00:21:18.517
And the other half of the
population--which included small

00:21:18.517 --> 00:21:21.248
farmers and gentry and
nobility--owned most of the

00:21:21.248 --> 00:21:21.750
land.
 

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.310
In the colonies,
two-thirds of the white men

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:29.528
owned land or businesses--
again, which gives you a sense

00:21:29.528 --> 00:21:33.073
of why the colonies are often
known as a sort of middling

00:21:33.073 --> 00:21:33.769
society.
 

00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:36.794
Also in the colonies there
wasn't such a stark contrast

00:21:36.794 --> 00:21:39.930
between the top and the bottom
of the social spectrum.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:43.026
So in England,
you had the royal Court and the

00:21:43.026 --> 00:21:47.361
courtiers and opulence and court
ritual and sort of kowtowing to

00:21:47.361 --> 00:21:50.940
the King at the very top of the
social spectrum.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:55.048
Obviously, the colonies did not
have something like that.

00:21:55.048 --> 00:21:57.627
They did have royal governors,
and certainly royal governors

00:21:57.627 --> 00:21:59.769
lived in fine style in
comparison with others,

00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:03.443
and there was certainly a
distinction between average

00:22:03.443 --> 00:22:07.061
people and gentlemen,
but the contrast between

00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:10.989
governors and farmers was
nowhere near the extreme

00:22:10.989 --> 00:22:16.036
contrast between a member of the
entrenched British nobility and

00:22:16.036 --> 00:22:18.038
a landless commoner.
 

00:22:18.038 --> 00:22:20.098
So in America the
spectrum--It's like the top and

00:22:20.098 --> 00:22:22.631
the bottom of that spectrum have
been sort of lopped off and

00:22:22.631 --> 00:22:24.818
what's in between is a little
bit more pliable.

00:22:24.818 --> 00:22:27.615
So more landholding,
broader franchise and

00:22:27.615 --> 00:22:31.442
everything that that entails,
more of a middling society,

00:22:31.442 --> 00:22:34.969
and now yet another colonial
difference that I hinted about

00:22:34.969 --> 00:22:38.192
at the start of today's lecture:
the fact that several

00:22:38.192 --> 00:22:41.720
generations of colonists had
lived and died in the colonies

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.910
having never been to England.
 

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.192
By the mid-eighteenth century
you had a colonial society full

00:22:48.192 --> 00:22:52.190
of people who often had no
actual personal tie to England

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.310
except an emotional tie,
and I talked about those

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.450
emotional ties last week.
 

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.368
So just think about this
comparison.

00:22:59.368 --> 00:23:03.265
The length of time between the
first settlement at Jamestown

00:23:03.265 --> 00:23:06.829
and the Declaration of
Independence is roughly the same

00:23:06.829 --> 00:23:10.790
as the length of time between
the Declaration of Independence

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.308
and World War II.
 

00:23:12.308 --> 00:23:12.624
Okay.
 

00:23:12.624 --> 00:23:16.209
We tend to collapse all of
early America into one big blob

00:23:16.209 --> 00:23:18.632
of early America,
and we assume it's a kind of a

00:23:18.632 --> 00:23:20.055
small blob,
but if you think about that,

00:23:20.055 --> 00:23:21.608
Declaration of Independence to
World War II,

00:23:21.608 --> 00:23:23.778
Jamestown to the Declaration of
Independence,

00:23:23.778 --> 00:23:27.769
we are talking about a broad
expanse of time.

00:23:27.769 --> 00:23:30.127
So these people,
or at least many of them,

00:23:30.127 --> 00:23:32.660
are truly British Americans at
this point.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:38.038
Colonists were also not Britons
in yet another way--

00:23:38.038 --> 00:23:41.170
another distinctive feature of
colonial society--

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.788
and that's again something I
referred to at the beginning,

00:23:43.788 --> 00:23:47.210
and that's the great ethnic and
religious diversity.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:51.500
As our friend, Mr.***Hamilton,
or Dr.***Hamilton, was noting,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.470
there were immigrants from
Germany,

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.838
Scotland, Ireland,
there were Quakers,

00:23:55.838 --> 00:23:57.759
there were Roman Catholics,
Congregationalists,

00:23:57.759 --> 00:23:59.960
and then later on Methodists
and Baptists.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.154
So generally speaking,
it's a reasonably pluralistic

00:24:03.154 --> 00:24:06.788
society with a relatively high
tolerance for diversity,

00:24:06.788 --> 00:24:08.519
although New Englanders in some
ways,

00:24:08.519 --> 00:24:10.630
particularly in early colonial
times,

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:12.500
are a little bit less tolerant.
 

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.118
Related to this diversity is
yet another colonial

00:24:16.118 --> 00:24:19.021
distinction,
and that's the religiosity in

00:24:19.021 --> 00:24:21.316
the colonies,
which is really heightened by

00:24:21.316 --> 00:24:24.936
the Great Awakening,
which was roughly from the

00:24:24.936 --> 00:24:26.920
1730s to the 1760s.
 

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.355
Now I've said that,
but what I really want to also

00:24:29.355 --> 00:24:32.386
point out: I'm not saying that
the Great Awakening is a purely

00:24:32.386 --> 00:24:34.880
colonial phenomenon,
because it isn't.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.144
And as a matter of fact it
spread to the colonies from

00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:41.384
England and from Ireland,
but its impact on the colonies

00:24:41.384 --> 00:24:44.162
would be different when you
combined it with some of the

00:24:44.162 --> 00:24:46.586
other things that were
distinctive about colonial

00:24:46.586 --> 00:24:49.009
society and life as I'm talking
about here.

00:24:49.009 --> 00:24:51.970
Now we can have a little Yale
moment here.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.088
I'm always looking for a Yale
moment.

00:24:54.088 --> 00:24:57.444
This is a little Yale moment,
because Jonathan Edwards is

00:24:57.444 --> 00:25:01.098
someone of importance in the
spread of the Great Awakening.

00:25:01.098 --> 00:25:04.655
His preaching really sparked
the New England branch of the

00:25:04.655 --> 00:25:05.778
Great Awakening.
 

00:25:05.778 --> 00:25:08.680
Edwards preached that God was
wrathful,

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.460
that endless torture awaited
the sinner,

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.321
but God was also loving and
wanted sinners to convert and

00:25:15.321 --> 00:25:18.453
turn towards God's love and,
most important,

00:25:18.453 --> 00:25:22.498
you could choose heaven or hell
depending on whether you chose

00:25:22.498 --> 00:25:23.358
to repent.
 

00:25:23.358 --> 00:25:26.720
And I can't resist--Whenever I
get to this part of the course,

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.708
I can't resist offering a
little snippet of one of

00:25:29.708 --> 00:25:32.615
Edwards' most famous sermons,
which is Sinners in the

00:25:32.615 --> 00:25:33.609
Hands of an Angry God.
 

00:25:33.609 --> 00:25:34.589
How many of you have read?
 

00:25:34.589 --> 00:25:37.640
A good number of you have read.
 

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.720
That's a great sermon, 1741.
 

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.939
I can't resist giving you your
own Great Awakening moment

00:25:42.939 --> 00:25:46.329
because that means I get to
actually be Edwards for a little

00:25:46.329 --> 00:25:48.630
bit and offer you the wrath of
God,

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.230
so I will offer you a tiny
snippet from Edwards' sermon.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:55.670
I think it's different when you
hear it from when you read it.

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:59.048
"The God that holds you
over the pit of hell,

00:25:59.048 --> 00:26:03.020
much as one holds a spider or
some loathsome insect over the

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:06.190
fire,
abhors you and is dreadfully

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.130
provoked.
 

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.470
His wrath towards you burns
like fire.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.636
He looks upon you as worthy of
nothing else but to be cast into

00:26:13.636 --> 00:26:14.200
the fire.
 

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.038
He is of purer eyes than to
bear to have you in his sight.

00:26:19.038 --> 00:26:23.256
You are ten thousand times more
abominable in his eyes than the

00:26:23.256 --> 00:26:26.180
most hateful venomous serpent is
in ours.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.811
You have offended him
infinitely more than ever a

00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:34.404
stubborn rebel did his prince,
and yet it is nothing but his

00:26:34.404 --> 00:26:38.808
hand that holds you from falling
into the fire every moment.

00:26:38.808 --> 00:26:43.086
It is to be ascribed to nothing
else that you did not go to hell

00:26:43.086 --> 00:26:45.792
the last night,
that you were suffered to awake

00:26:45.792 --> 00:26:48.568
again in this world after you
closed your eyes to sleep,

00:26:48.568 --> 00:26:52.144
and there was no other reason
to be given why you have not

00:26:52.144 --> 00:26:55.529
dropped into hell since you
arose this morning and that

00:26:55.529 --> 00:26:58.163
God's--
but that God's hand has held

00:26:58.163 --> 00:26:58.720
you up.
 

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:02.615
There is no other reason to be
given why you have not gone to

00:27:02.615 --> 00:27:04.630
hell since you have sat here.
 

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:08.970
Oh, sinner, consider the
fearful danger you are in.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:12.501
You hang by a slender thread
with the flames of divine wrath

00:27:12.501 --> 00:27:16.038
flashing about it,
ready every moment to singe it

00:27:16.038 --> 00:27:19.770
and burn it asunder,
and you have no interest in any

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.230
mediator and nothing to lay hold
of save yourself,

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.058
nothing to keep off the flames
of wrath,

00:27:25.058 --> 00:27:28.007
nothing of your own,
nothing that you have ever

00:27:28.007 --> 00:27:30.221
done,
nothing that you can do to

00:27:30.221 --> 00:27:32.970
induce God to spare you one
moment."

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.730
I think--wow,
that's sermonizing.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:37.990
That's "pow"
in-your-face sermonizing.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.805
So that, kind of,
is the core of the Great

00:27:40.805 --> 00:27:42.108
Awakening, right?
 

00:27:42.108 --> 00:27:46.337
This belief in the sinfulness
and helplessness of humankind

00:27:46.337 --> 00:27:50.128
and the possibility of
redemption if you individually

00:27:50.128 --> 00:27:52.390
make the choice and repent.
 

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.769
And as suggested by Edwards'
sermon, there were often some

00:27:55.769 --> 00:27:59.506
tearful emotional conversions at
the big camp meetings that took

00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:00.868
place at this time.
 

00:28:00.868 --> 00:28:02.976
And I actually have an
eyewitness account of a camp

00:28:02.976 --> 00:28:04.419
meeting,
which I offer you partly

00:28:04.419 --> 00:28:06.621
because, as you'll see,
there's an aspect of it which I

00:28:06.621 --> 00:28:07.650
consider truly ridiculous.
 

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.868
But it's offered by Benjamin
Franklin,

00:28:09.868 --> 00:28:12.498
which I also think is
interesting, and you'll see the

00:28:12.498 --> 00:28:15.429
Enlightenment and the Great
Awakening come up right against

00:28:15.429 --> 00:28:17.348
each other in this little
passage.

00:28:17.348 --> 00:28:20.426
Franklin actually is in
Pennsylvania and he says he sees

00:28:20.426 --> 00:28:22.329
Whitefield preaching to a crowd.
 

00:28:22.329 --> 00:28:26.386
As he describes it,
"In 1739 arrived among us

00:28:26.386 --> 00:28:29.490
from Ireland the Reverend
Mr. Whitefield,

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.298
who had made himself remarkable
there as an itinerant preacher.

00:28:33.298 --> 00:28:36.910
He was at first permitted to
preach in some of our churches;

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:38.890
but the clergy,
taking a dislike to him,

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.038
soon refused him their pulpits,
and he was obliged to preach in

00:28:42.038 --> 00:28:42.798
the fields.
 

00:28:42.798 --> 00:28:46.420
The multitudes of all sects and
denominations that attended his

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.105
sermons were enormous,
and it was a matter of

00:28:49.105 --> 00:28:51.526
speculation to me,
who was of that number,

00:28:51.526 --> 00:28:54.877
to observe the extraordinary
influence of his oratory on his

00:28:54.877 --> 00:28:58.058
hearers and how much they
admired and respected him,

00:28:58.058 --> 00:29:00.568
notwithstanding his common
abuse of them,

00:29:00.568 --> 00:29:03.071
by assuring them that they were
naturally "half beasts and

00:29:03.071 --> 00:29:03.880
half devils."
 

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.718
Being among the crowd,
"being among the hindmost

00:29:06.718 --> 00:29:09.071
of the crowd"--
so he's towards the back of the

00:29:09.071 --> 00:29:11.034
crowd" --
"I had the curiosity to

00:29:11.034 --> 00:29:14.960
learn how far he could be heard,
by retiring backwards ..."

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.236
Okay.
 

00:29:15.236 --> 00:29:18.050
So now Franklin says,
'I wonder how far I could back

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.150
away and still hear him
preaching.'

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:21.702
Clearfully -- Clearly,
at this moment,

00:29:21.702 --> 00:29:23.588
he's not really thinking about
the message.

00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:25.769
So I backed away "towards
the river,

00:29:25.769 --> 00:29:29.390
and I found his voice distinct
'till I came near Front Street,

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:31.740
when some noise in the street
obscured it."

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.058
And at this point you can
really hear the sort of

00:29:34.058 --> 00:29:36.960
Enlightenment come banging up
against the Great Awakening.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.329
"Imagining then a
semicircle, of which my distance

00:29:40.329 --> 00:29:42.890
should be the radius,"
[laughter]

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.272
"and that it was filled
with auditors,

00:29:45.272 --> 00:29:47.769
to each of whom I allowed two
square feet.

00:29:47.769 --> 00:29:50.702
I computed that he might well
be heard by more than thirty

00:29:50.702 --> 00:29:51.269
thousand.
 

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:53.973
This reconciled me to the
newspaper accounts of his having

00:29:53.973 --> 00:29:56.680
preached to twenty-five thousand
people in the fields,

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.659
and to the histories of
generals haranguing whole armies

00:29:59.659 --> 00:30:01.880
of which I had sometimes
doubted."

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.838
So he computes out the radius,
an area.

00:30:04.838 --> 00:30:05.076
Wow.
 

00:30:05.076 --> 00:30:07.930
You can actually be preaching
to 30,000 people.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.367
Now, that said,
Franklin says by the end of the

00:30:10.367 --> 00:30:13.709
sermon--when clearly there was a
collection plate that was going

00:30:13.709 --> 00:30:15.828
to be passed around--Franklin
said,

00:30:15.828 --> 00:30:20.019
"I first silently resolved
he should get nothing from me.

00:30:20.019 --> 00:30:22.067
I had in my pocket a handful of
copper money,

00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:24.490
three or four silver dollars
and five gold pieces.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.180
As he proceeded,
I began to soften and concluded

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:29.828
to give the copper.
 

00:30:29.828 --> 00:30:32.851
Another stroke of his oratory
made me ashamed of that and

00:30:32.851 --> 00:30:34.740
determined me to give the
silver;

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:38.144
and he finished so admirably
that I emptied my whole pocket

00:30:38.144 --> 00:30:40.259
into the dish,
gold and all."

00:30:40.259 --> 00:30:44.059
So even Franklin sort of has to
admire and ultimately contribute

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:45.690
to what's going on there.
 

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:49.564
So even this sort of true man
of the Enlightenment found

00:30:49.564 --> 00:30:52.029
himself affected by this
oratory.

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.467
Okay.
 

00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:57.897
So what was the impact of such
Great Awakening sentiment in the

00:30:57.897 --> 00:30:58.950
colonies?
 

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:02.631
Well, in part,
given the distinctive state of

00:31:02.631 --> 00:31:06.832
affairs in the colonies,
it suggested to people that

00:31:06.832 --> 00:31:11.435
they had the personal ability to
change their lives through their

00:31:11.435 --> 00:31:12.660
own free will.
 

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:16.916
It was personally empowering,
and in that sense it was sort

00:31:16.916 --> 00:31:18.900
of a democratizing force.
 

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.259
I almost hesitated when I was
writing this to use the word

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:23.618
"democratizing"
because I didn't want to be--

00:31:23.618 --> 00:31:25.463
As I mentioned on that first
day, you put the

00:31:25.463 --> 00:31:27.643
"democracy"
word out there and all kinds of

00:31:27.643 --> 00:31:29.407
lights go off,
but I just couldn't think of a

00:31:29.407 --> 00:31:31.938
better word,
so democratizing I'll stick

00:31:31.938 --> 00:31:32.400
with.
 

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.200
Also, the Great Awakening
preached spiritual equality,

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.594
and included women,
African Americans and the

00:31:38.594 --> 00:31:40.320
poor--
and the power of making

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.400
choices, though the impact of
that,

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.920
as we'll see,
might not have been so great.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.727
Plus it was an
anti-authoritarian force led by

00:31:48.727 --> 00:31:53.888
unorthodox preachers and people
not attached to an established

00:31:53.888 --> 00:31:54.818
church.
 

00:31:54.818 --> 00:31:58.760
So we have here a mix of
individualism and personal

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.650
empowerment and throw in an
emotional sort of righteousness.

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:07.661
That's a really kind of a heady
mixture of feelings and ideas

00:32:07.661 --> 00:32:11.337
that would eventually help to
encourage a real spirit of

00:32:11.337 --> 00:32:13.009
political resistance.
 

00:32:13.009 --> 00:32:13.320
Okay.
 

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.240
I'm going to mention a few more
basic things about colonial life

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.480
that were different from
England.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.650
Very quickly.
 

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.038
First, the realities of living
on a frontier,

00:32:24.038 --> 00:32:27.880
which not only fostered a sense
of independence,

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.231
but also a sense of community,
partly in a defensive way

00:32:31.231 --> 00:32:34.951
because of fears about Indians
and because of the difficulties

00:32:34.951 --> 00:32:38.058
of forging a homestead or
creating a community.

00:32:38.058 --> 00:32:41.657
On a more positive side,
colonists generally had

00:32:41.657 --> 00:32:45.180
healthier living conditions than
in England.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:48.405
Food was plentiful,
there were plenty of open

00:32:48.405 --> 00:32:50.773
spaces,
and you can actually see this

00:32:50.773 --> 00:32:54.211
concretely when you look at the
average size of an English man

00:32:54.211 --> 00:32:57.423
and an English woman and a
colonial man and colonial woman

00:32:57.423 --> 00:33:00.058
towards the turn--
the middle of the eighteenth

00:33:00.058 --> 00:33:00.490
century.
 

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.807
Basically, the average size of
an Englishman in the middle of

00:33:03.807 --> 00:33:05.910
the eighteenth century was 5
foot 6.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:07.140
And the--This made me happy.
 

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.336
The average size of an English
woman was 5 feet,

00:33:09.336 --> 00:33:10.460
which is basically me.
 

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.074
[laughs]
It makes me so happy to think

00:33:12.074 --> 00:33:13.950
there's a time when I was
average height.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.848
I feel so tall.
 

00:33:15.848 --> 00:33:19.897
However, colonial men and women
on average tended to be a couple

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:21.118
of inches taller.
 

00:33:21.118 --> 00:33:24.440
So you could see--plentiful
food, wide-open spaces--

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.190
actually people are healthier
and bigger,

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:30.140
which was true also among
soldiers as a matter of fact,

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.509
which was interesting;
you could see it.

00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:36.791
This brings us to the third
major category of things that

00:33:36.791 --> 00:33:39.723
contributed to the
difference--differences in being

00:33:39.723 --> 00:33:41.598
a British American colonist.
 

00:33:41.598 --> 00:33:43.410
So we have the type of person
who migrated;

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.042
we just had a whole bunch of
living conditions in the

00:33:46.042 --> 00:33:46.598
colonies.
 

00:33:46.598 --> 00:33:49.718
This is the third category,
which is the nature of the

00:33:49.718 --> 00:33:52.190
British administration of the
colonies,

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:55.660
which, as I mentioned last
week, was kind of light-handed,

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.923
so colonial government and
society could develop in ways

00:33:58.923 --> 00:34:02.128
that Britain might not
necessarily have desired or even

00:34:02.128 --> 00:34:03.019
recognized.
 

00:34:03.019 --> 00:34:07.784
One of the most striking
effects of this lack of imperial

00:34:07.784 --> 00:34:12.889
control was the power of the
typical colonial legislature.

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:16.541
Left alone, the colonists
developed strong legislatures

00:34:16.541 --> 00:34:20.666
which often were full of very
contentious individuals who felt

00:34:20.666 --> 00:34:24.320
entitled and compelled to fight
for their rights,

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:27.780
or what I discussed last week,
their English liberties.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.257
Some of these colonial
legislatures were so strong that

00:34:31.257 --> 00:34:34.480
they often won battles against
royal governors--

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:38.081
battles that were not taken
much note of by the Crown at the

00:34:38.081 --> 00:34:39.985
time,
because the Crown wasn't

00:34:39.985 --> 00:34:42.579
administering to the colonies
very closely.

00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:45.963
And in fact,
by the 1760s most of the

00:34:45.963 --> 00:34:51.416
colonies had in place all of the
conditions necessary to be

00:34:51.416 --> 00:34:53.860
self-governing states.
 

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:58.005
They had elective assemblies
and other institutions of local

00:34:58.005 --> 00:35:00.507
government,
and these institutions had

00:35:00.507 --> 00:35:03.780
broad powers over the internal
affairs of the colonies.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.440
They had a reservoir of
political leaders drawn from the

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.119
elite.
 

00:35:09.119 --> 00:35:12.657
And colonists recognized and
were jealous of their power of

00:35:12.657 --> 00:35:15.525
self-government,
and were not shy about fighting

00:35:15.525 --> 00:35:17.659
royal officials for this power.
 

00:35:17.659 --> 00:35:19.788
So by the 1760s,
there's a lot of things in

00:35:19.788 --> 00:35:21.916
place for these colonies,
in a sense, to be

00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:24.097
self-governing,
although obviously they were

00:35:24.097 --> 00:35:25.010
not already.
 

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:29.889
So in summary,
what does all of this add up

00:35:29.889 --> 00:35:30.469
to?
 

00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:34.510
What do I mean when I refer to
being a British American?

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:38.971
Well, we've talked about a
tradition of voicing opinions

00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:40.349
and grievances.
 

00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:44.572
We've talked about a sense of
entitlement to owning property

00:35:44.572 --> 00:35:45.360
and land.
 

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.460
We've talked about assumptions
about active participation in

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.130
the political process.
 

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.266
We've talked about a
willingness to take risks and

00:35:54.266 --> 00:35:56.059
fight for what you wanted.
 

00:35:56.059 --> 00:35:59.793
We've talked about an
independent spirit and jealousy

00:35:59.793 --> 00:36:01.659
about your independence.
 

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:05.268
And we've talked about relative
tolerance of ethnic and

00:36:05.268 --> 00:36:06.739
religious diversity.
 

00:36:06.739 --> 00:36:10.936
You can hear this sort of
mixture of things in a comment

00:36:10.936 --> 00:36:15.284
by a British officer in the
colonies during the French and

00:36:15.284 --> 00:36:16.429
Indian War.
 

00:36:16.429 --> 00:36:19.943
And he observed and wrote back
home, "'Tis the nature of

00:36:19.943 --> 00:36:23.458
this people to do all in their
power to pull down every legal

00:36:23.458 --> 00:36:24.280
authority.
 

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.389
There is no law prevailing at
present here."

00:36:27.389 --> 00:36:30.605
That's a little bit of an
exaggeration I would say--but

00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:32.570
another arrogant British quote.
 

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.820
I always do lots of arrogant
British quotes.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.360
"There is no law
prevailing at present here,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.059
that I have met with,
but the rule every man pleases

00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:41.489
to lay down to himself.
 

00:36:41.489 --> 00:36:44.536
Every man insists upon
following the dictates of his

00:36:44.536 --> 00:36:46.510
own will without control."
 

00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.179
A little bit of an
exaggeration,

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:51.304
but you can see certainly what
he feels like he's seeing as

00:36:51.304 --> 00:36:54.159
compared with what he knows from
back in England.

00:36:54.159 --> 00:36:57.733
Or as a member of the
Massachusetts legislature put

00:36:57.733 --> 00:37:01.806
it, "Our people were not
calculated to be kept in any

00:37:01.806 --> 00:37:03.449
particular service.
 

00:37:03.449 --> 00:37:07.873
They soon grow troublesome and
uneasy by reflecting upon their

00:37:07.873 --> 00:37:10.300
folly" by--
"in bringing themselves

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:12.739
into a state of subjection when
they might have continued free

00:37:12.739 --> 00:37:13.739
and independent."
 

00:37:13.739 --> 00:37:17.070
Now that sounds like a sort of
wonderful thing,

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.889
impressive, admirable,
like 'oh, our people are--

00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:22.710
they like to be independent and
if they commit to something,

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.150
they're not happy about that
commitment,

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:25.909
because they think--wow,
I could have been free and

00:37:25.909 --> 00:37:27.070
independent; what have I done?'
 

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.422
The problem with that is:
try putting a bunch of those

00:37:29.422 --> 00:37:32.085
people into an army and then
expecting them to stay in it for

00:37:32.085 --> 00:37:33.239
a long period of time.
 

00:37:33.239 --> 00:37:36.760
George Washington was not a
happy camper for part--

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.177
a good part of the Revolution
because he was stuck with a lot

00:37:40.177 --> 00:37:42.570
of soldiers who had that point
of view--

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.940
like, 'Well,
I'll do this for a little while

00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:46.043
and then I'll leave.
 

00:37:46.043 --> 00:37:46.429
Bye.
 

00:37:46.429 --> 00:37:48.460
" And so it's kind of hard
to command that kind of an army,

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:50.840
as we'll see,
and--I guess I can't say I'm

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.219
proud to say--
Connecticut was a problem.

00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:55.786
[laughs]
Connecticut--as we'll see,

00:37:55.786 --> 00:37:58.139
Connecticut had issues;
Rhode Island too.

00:37:58.139 --> 00:37:59.382
I think I mentioned that in the
first lecture,

00:37:59.382 --> 00:37:59.989
but Connecticut too.
 

00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:02.315
Soldiers particularly had
problems wanting to stick

00:38:02.315 --> 00:38:04.286
around,
but that was a general problem

00:38:04.286 --> 00:38:05.914
as well,
the sort of spirit of

00:38:05.914 --> 00:38:08.539
independence and 'I've done what
I wanted to do;

00:38:08.539 --> 00:38:09.940
I'm going to now do something
different.'

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:14.760
So we've looked at being a
British colonist.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.369
We've looked at being a British
American.

00:38:16.369 --> 00:38:19.927
The next step that we're going
to be taking on Thursday is

00:38:19.927 --> 00:38:23.050
going to be looking at
intercolonial relations--

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.400
looking at how the colonies
felt about each other,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.789
looking at how the colonies
interacted with each other,

00:38:29.789 --> 00:38:33.733
how they felt about each other,
what their sense was of any

00:38:33.733 --> 00:38:37.065
kind of cooperation or union
between these sort of

00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:38.289
colony-states.
 

00:38:38.289 --> 00:38:42.059
And by the end of Thursday's
lecture, we're going to see the

00:38:42.059 --> 00:38:46.018
first glimmers of tension with
the passage of the Stamp Act.

00:38:46.018 --> 00:38:48.280
So by the end of the next
lecture--You can see why,

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.179
when I mentioned in that first
lecture that there was someone

00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:52.105
in--
when I first taught this

00:38:52.105 --> 00:38:53.927
course--who raised his hand,
probably at the end of this

00:38:53.927 --> 00:38:55.402
lecture,
and said, "Where are the

00:38:55.402 --> 00:38:56.911
dates?,"
that we've had two lectures

00:38:56.911 --> 00:38:59.356
without a lot of dates,
but the Stamp Act--We have an

00:38:59.356 --> 00:39:01.715
actual concrete thing coming on
Thursday [laughs]

00:39:01.715 --> 00:39:03.880
and then actual events of the
Revolution.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.179
But hopefully with these three
lectures you have some kind of a

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:11.255
sense of the--
sort of--foundation of where

00:39:11.255 --> 00:39:14.253
we're working from,
as we're now going to show

00:39:14.253 --> 00:39:18.730
people basically getting upset,
working themselves a logic of

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:22.750
resistance,
and then acting on that logic.

00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.240
I think it's important
obviously to understand where

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.123
the colonists were coming from
before you plunge right in to

00:39:28.123 --> 00:39:30.713
seeing them rebelling against
what they've had and for

00:39:30.713 --> 00:39:31.739
something else.
 

00:39:31.739 --> 00:39:33.969
But I think certainly in these
two first lectures,

00:39:33.969 --> 00:39:39.121
you do get a sense of some of
the ways in which the colonies

00:39:39.121 --> 00:39:43.525
were prepared to resist,
or maybe predisposed to resist,

00:39:43.525 --> 00:39:46.630
and some of the reasons why it
took actually,

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.034
as you'll see,
a pretty long time for the

00:39:49.034 --> 00:39:51.500
colonists to decide to actually
rebel--

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.760
that it took a while.
 

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:56.384
People sort of let go,
finger by finger,

00:39:56.384 --> 00:39:58.000
of the British Empire.
 

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.420
They let go,
piece by piece,

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:02.525
until finally they felt that
there was no alternative except

00:40:02.525 --> 00:40:03.420
a revolution.
 

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.590
I will end there.
 

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:06.239
I will see you on Thursday.
 

00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:09.657
If you have questions,
come up and see me now at the

00:40:09.657 --> 00:40:13.277
end of class or e-mail them to
me and I will see you on

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:14.150
Thursday.
 

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:19.000

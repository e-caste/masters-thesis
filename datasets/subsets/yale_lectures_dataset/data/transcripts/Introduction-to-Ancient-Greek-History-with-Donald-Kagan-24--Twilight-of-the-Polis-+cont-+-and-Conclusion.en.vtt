00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.040
Professor Donald
Kagan: I have a title for

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.802
today's talk.
I call it, "Philip,

00:00:04.802 --> 00:00:09.143
Demosthenes and the Fall of the
Polis," and I read that to you

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:13.484
because it's always useful to
remember that while we look back

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:17.897
on these events and know their
outcome and can assign to them a

00:00:17.897 --> 00:00:22.026
special significance,
let's never forget they didn't

00:00:22.026 --> 00:00:26.370
know that they were on the brink
of the end of the independent

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.930
polis.
In fact, I'm sure if you came

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.023
along in 362 after that battle
it would never have occurred to

00:00:35.023 --> 00:00:40.032
you that that whole fundamental
arrangement of the world that

00:00:40.032 --> 00:00:43.675
had been sort of in place,
to some degree,

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:47.405
perhaps as far back as the
eighth century was going to

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:50.010
change its character very
sharply,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.839
and that although there would
still be poleis that

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.249
would be going on,
it might seem in the same old

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:01.378
way, even after the Macedonian
conquest, the fact was that none

00:01:01.378 --> 00:01:06.424
of them ever again really was
autonomous in the sense of to be

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:11.470
fully in control of its own fate
both in terms of the internal

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.808
constitution and also,
more importantly or at least

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:19.753
the one that was most in danger,
the capacity to engage in

00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:24.045
international relations freely
and to be free to make their own

00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:26.538
foreign policy.
So, as I say,

00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:30.384
it's going to be a very major
change but it's something that

00:01:30.384 --> 00:01:33.840
they don't know they're in the
middle of watching.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:44.640
Well, in 359 a man called
Philip became King of Macedon.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.849
We know the Macedonians were
fundamentally Greeks.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.537
That is to say,
they were Greek speakers and

00:01:56.537 --> 00:02:01.340
ethnically, if there is such a
thing, they were Greek.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.906
But they were so far out of the
mainstream of the development of

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:09.892
the Greek poleis that we
have been examining this

00:02:09.892 --> 00:02:12.602
semester that many,
many Greeks,

00:02:12.602 --> 00:02:16.947
perhaps most of them,
didn't think of them as being

00:02:16.947 --> 00:02:19.642
Greek.
When Greeks thought about what

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:23.277
it was to be a Greek they
thought about more than the fact

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:25.699
that they spoke the Greek
language,

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:30.124
they thought fundamentally--if
you get to Aristotle you see how

00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:33.532
thoroughly true this is,
it had to do with a culture,

00:02:33.532 --> 00:02:36.417
a way of life and that way of
life was based upon the

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:40.682
independent polis.
Well, Macedon did not have

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:44.141
such a structure.
The Greeks called the

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:49.027
Macedonians an ethnos,
a tribal group is what that

00:02:49.027 --> 00:02:52.395
sort of means.
We use the word "nation"

00:02:52.395 --> 00:02:56.479
somehow to translate
ethnos and that's okay.

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:59.148
The word "nation" itself,
you remember,

00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:02.729
comes from the Latin word which
means to be born;

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.990
people who are born of the same
stock.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.169
But for the Greeks it had a
different meaning;

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:13.254
it was people who participated
in the culture that they

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:17.717
designated as Hellenic and they
thought the Macedonians fell

00:03:17.717 --> 00:03:21.030
outside of that.
There were no poleis in

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.709
the Macedonian kingdom.
It was something that we might

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.748
call feudal.
That is to say,

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:30.098
yes there was a monarch,
but there were powerful

00:03:30.098 --> 00:03:34.373
noblemen who were practically
independent and who owed only a

00:03:34.373 --> 00:03:38.791
limited allegiance to the king
and who were really the dominant

00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:42.782
figures in the state for most of
the history prior to the

00:03:42.782 --> 00:03:46.073
appearance of Philip.
On the other hand,

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:49.165
the king was an important and
powerful character so that you

00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:52.467
have--this was true of European
feudal states at certain periods

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.814
in their development.
On the one hand,

00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:57.890
the fundamental society was
based upon great lords,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.535
great noblemen,
barons, but there was a king

00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:04.079
and he was not inconsequential.
That's the situation that

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.250
pertained in Macedon.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.837
In a certain sense,
if a Greek had looked at

00:04:10.837 --> 00:04:12.900
Macedonian society prior to
Philip,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.291
he might have described it as
Homeric, and you'll be familiar

00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:21.029
with that.
Sure, there were guys called

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.522
basileus,
but they were not really the

00:04:25.522 --> 00:04:30.832
rulers over the barons,
these great noblemen in their

00:04:30.832 --> 00:04:33.442
kingdom.
They thought of it as

00:04:33.442 --> 00:04:35.639
uncivilized in the technical
sense.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.807
If you don't live in a
polis,

00:04:38.807 --> 00:04:43.680
a city, as they understood it,
then you are not civilized;

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.256
you are part of an
ethnos and that's the

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:49.449
term they used of the tribal
societies all around them,

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:53.324
Illyrians, Scythians,
they were all from an

00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:56.264
ethnos.
The Macedonians,

00:04:56.264 --> 00:05:00.108
on the other hand,
claimed very proudly and

00:05:00.108 --> 00:05:04.959
powerfully, and insistently that
they were Greeks;

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:08.925
they were Hellenes,
and they probably invented a

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:13.178
myth of their descent.
Indeed, not merely from Greeks

00:05:13.178 --> 00:05:17.189
but from the real Greeks,
that is to say the Argives,

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.639
who were the leading people in
the time of Homer's poetry and

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.238
they claimed direct descent from
Agamemnon and the other Argive

00:05:26.238 --> 00:05:28.921
kings.
We hear about various

00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:34.100
Macedonian monarchs of some
importance prior to Philip,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.719
back at the time of the Persian
War, Alexander the first played

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:40.930
an interesting and shady role
between the Greeks and the

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.754
Persians.
During the Peloponnesian War we

00:05:43.754 --> 00:05:47.483
hear of a King Perdiccas,
who also played a role shifting

00:05:47.483 --> 00:05:50.279
between the Spartans and the
Athenians.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:53.551
This business of shifting
between sides is not just

00:05:53.551 --> 00:05:57.331
because they're shifty people.
It's that their status is such

00:05:57.331 --> 00:06:00.768
that they're always vulnerable
and not powerful enough to

00:06:00.768 --> 00:06:04.451
defend themselves and so they
have to make the best deal they

00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:07.519
can with whoever has the power
at any moment.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:11.895
One other Macedonian king has
left a name that we know

00:06:11.895 --> 00:06:14.290
something about,
Archelaus,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.644
who followed Perdiccas,
one of the things about him was

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:23.240
that he kept a kind of a
cultural court at his capital,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.253
and for instance Euripides,
for reasons that we do not

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:31.721
know, left Athens at some point
in the Peloponnesian War and

00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:36.114
came to Macedon where he joined
a collection of artists and

00:06:36.114 --> 00:06:39.871
scholars,
and whatever that Archelaus was

00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:44.635
gathering in his kingdom.
Well, Philip becomes king in

00:06:44.635 --> 00:06:49.674
359 and the Macedonian kings
were very much like Homeric

00:06:49.674 --> 00:06:53.339
kings as we have described them
here.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:56.230
That is, yes you had to have a
dynastic claim,

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.634
you had to be a member of the
royal family to be king,

00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:03.956
but that wasn't good enough.
You had to also have--remember,

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:06.953
to rule as I said about the
Homeric kings,

00:07:06.953 --> 00:07:09.615
iphi,
by force, by power,

00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:13.652
you had to have the actual
capacity to command and

00:07:13.652 --> 00:07:18.678
sometimes you had to demonstrate
that by fighting it out among

00:07:18.678 --> 00:07:23.374
various potential successors
with having the winner coming

00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:26.903
out as the king.
Something like that is what

00:07:26.903 --> 00:07:29.317
Philip did.
He was not the most direct

00:07:29.317 --> 00:07:34.075
descendant of the previous king.
He was left as a kind of a

00:07:34.075 --> 00:07:40.212
regent over the under-aged young
king of just a boy and he was

00:07:40.212 --> 00:07:44.839
actually Philip's nephew and
Philip's ward,

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:49.697
and Philip took care of him in
more senses than one,

00:07:49.697 --> 00:07:54.839
finally killing him and
replacing him on the throne.

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:58.850
That was not a unique event
in Macedonian history.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.236
So, Philip is now on the throne
and, of course,

00:08:03.236 --> 00:08:08.290
with this disputed descent,
this disputed right to the

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.329
throne,
you can imagine that he is not

00:08:11.329 --> 00:08:15.110
in the most secure position when
he takes over this job,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.412
and so I think some part of his
actions, certainly at the early

00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:22.582
part of his career,
and perhaps all the way

00:08:22.582 --> 00:08:26.529
through, was meant to
demonstrate his own greatness,

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:31.270
his own capacity to be king so
as to put down all resistance

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.769
internally and for that purpose
what could be better than

00:08:35.769 --> 00:08:39.483
spreading the boundaries,
increasing the power,

00:08:39.483 --> 00:08:43.370
and in making the greatness of
Macedon more than it had been

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.940
before and that's what he
undertook.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.104
It looks as though,
I think we have enough evidence

00:08:49.104 --> 00:08:52.826
to believe, that he certainly,
of course, meant to rule

00:08:52.826 --> 00:08:57.209
Macedon and to do whatever was
necessary, however harsh to make

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:00.878
that secure.
But it is pretty clear that he

00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:05.400
had it in mind to conquer
Greece, to make himself the

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.986
master of Greece.
That was certainly one of his

00:09:08.986 --> 00:09:11.767
objectives.
As a matter of fact,

00:09:11.767 --> 00:09:16.391
an interesting part of his
biography was that as a young

00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:19.669
man--probably I should say as a
boy,

00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:23.518
probably in his teens,
he was sent to Thebes as a

00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:27.927
hostage as a result of a war
between the Thebans and the

00:09:27.927 --> 00:09:31.009
Macedonians,
but he was treated as a member

00:09:31.009 --> 00:09:34.305
of the royal family.
He was treated very decently

00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:37.575
and with respect,
and he spent his time in the

00:09:37.575 --> 00:09:42.072
house of Epaminondas.
Can you imagine a better place

00:09:42.072 --> 00:09:47.301
for a young king with his
military ambitions to be brought

00:09:47.301 --> 00:09:52.530
up than in the house of the man
who is surely the foremost

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:58.309
general in the Greece of his
time and perhaps of any time,

00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:01.818
and I think we should imagine
that he must have learned a

00:10:01.818 --> 00:10:04.450
great deal about military
affairs there.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:09.712
There remains the question,
did Philip already have in his

00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:13.940
mind the plan of conquering the
Persian Empire,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.075
which was, of course,
the job that was completed by

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:20.399
his son, because whatever
Philip's intentions may have

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:23.409
been he died before he could
carry them out.

00:10:23.409 --> 00:10:27.184
I don't think we can be certain
about that, but it was an idea

00:10:27.184 --> 00:10:30.029
that he didn't have to do a lot
to dream up.

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:33.488
I've mentioned to you how many
an orator, Isocrates,

00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:36.268
most famously,
had been calling on various

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:40.539
Greek states and individuals to
conquer the Persian Empire,

00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:44.154
to solve Greece's problems,
and he wrote such a letter to

00:10:44.154 --> 00:10:47.834
Philip once Philip became the
most powerful figure in that

00:10:47.834 --> 00:10:51.073
world.
So, he certainly could have had

00:10:51.073 --> 00:10:53.172
the idea;
I mean, he certainly did have

00:10:53.172 --> 00:10:55.480
the idea--whether he was
planning to do that or not we

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.351
don't know.
Now, his first--sort of the

00:10:59.351 --> 00:11:05.560
instrument that permitted him
and Macedon to become as great

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.190
as they did was the army that he
created.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:14.436
I mean, it is very he who is
the revolutionary,

00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:20.159
the military genius who creates
the weapon which will allow him

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:24.361
to conquer Greece,
and it's the same military

00:11:24.361 --> 00:11:29.373
force that enables Alexander the
Great, who had brought to it

00:11:29.373 --> 00:11:34.326
brilliant military talents,
but he had an instrument shaped

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:39.299
for him that was already far and
away the best army in the Greek

00:11:39.299 --> 00:11:41.382
world,
the best army of the Greek

00:11:41.382 --> 00:11:43.810
world had ever seen,
perhaps as good an army as

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.080
there ever existed in the
ancient world.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.901
This is the great
achievement of Philip,

00:11:48.901 --> 00:11:51.330
or at least that was a basis of
it.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:58.170
He was not merely a hoplite
battle leader in the old style.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.596
One thing about Philip that was
very important was his

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:07.460
temperament, his mind,
his approach to warfare.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.919
He simply didn't accept the
notion of defeat.

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:16.051
He didn't accept the notion of
making some kind of a deal

00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:20.330
except on his terms when he
found it necessary to do so.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:24.709
He's famous for having said
after a temporary setback

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:28.771
against one of his opponents,
Philip has said,

00:12:28.771 --> 00:12:32.944
"I have not fled,
but I have retired as rams do

00:12:32.944 --> 00:12:38.660
in order that I might make a
stronger attack the next time."

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.589
He really lived that principle.
Nobody ever defeated him

00:12:43.589 --> 00:12:46.829
permanently.
If he had to accept a temporary

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:50.745
setback he immediately went to
work to repair it through a

00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:54.112
variety of means,
military, diplomatic and

00:12:54.112 --> 00:12:59.311
whatever else he had available.
But as I'm saying at the

00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:03.969
moment, he crafted this great
grand new army,

00:13:03.969 --> 00:13:06.947
supplied,
led, and organized quite

00:13:06.947 --> 00:13:11.144
differently from what I have
described to you in the past as

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:14.962
the standard Greek practice,
which was essentially the

00:13:14.962 --> 00:13:17.026
hoplite phalanx,
and as you know,

00:13:17.026 --> 00:13:20.316
in the course of the
Peloponnesian War in the fourth

00:13:20.316 --> 00:13:24.186
century new gimmicks were added
to that and different devices

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:27.669
were contributed to it but still
that was true.

00:13:27.669 --> 00:13:32.006
Now, Philip absorbed all the
things that had been going on

00:13:32.006 --> 00:13:35.354
before his time,
but he also made fundamental

00:13:35.354 --> 00:13:38.549
changes in the way that things
worked.

00:13:38.549 --> 00:13:42.367
To his phalanx,
and I was going to say,

00:13:42.367 --> 00:13:45.782
of grim professional
soldiers--now,

00:13:45.782 --> 00:13:51.809
that I think is in itself an
enormously important thing.

00:13:51.809 --> 00:13:56.821
We have something new on the
Greek scene, an army which is a

00:13:56.821 --> 00:13:59.470
national army.
That is to say,

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:03.256
it is made up of Macedonians
serving Macedon,

00:14:03.256 --> 00:14:08.309
under a Macedonian king,
but they are not the citizen

00:14:08.309 --> 00:14:14.257
soldiers that we have examined
in the case of the polis

00:14:14.257 --> 00:14:17.271
and its phalanx.
They are hoplites in that

00:14:17.271 --> 00:14:19.719
phalanx.
They were professional

00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:24.090
soldiers so that their full time
job was being an army;

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:26.840
they did not spend their spare
time back on farms.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.777
That means Philip had to pay
them a salary for them to

00:14:30.777 --> 00:14:32.562
perform.
At the same time,

00:14:32.562 --> 00:14:36.059
they were not a mercenary army
in the traditional sense.

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:40.481
They were not people gathered
anywhere who fought for whoever

00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:43.539
hired them;
they were very much Macedonian

00:14:43.539 --> 00:14:45.967
soldiers.
Something we can understand in

00:14:45.967 --> 00:14:48.961
the United States today--an
unusual thing in American

00:14:48.961 --> 00:14:51.840
history beginning only a couple
of decades ago.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.122
We have that sort of an army.
We have a professional national

00:14:57.122 --> 00:15:01.430
army, and I think this is an
objective statement,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.379
it has become the best army in
the world.

00:15:05.379 --> 00:15:08.698
There are many reasons for
that, but I would argue one

00:15:08.698 --> 00:15:12.456
reason is that if you can have
the sociological background to

00:15:12.456 --> 00:15:16.517
permit that kind of an army,
you are in very good shape

00:15:16.517 --> 00:15:18.989
indeed.
That's what Philip was able to

00:15:18.989 --> 00:15:21.194
create.
The kind of loyalty,

00:15:21.194 --> 00:15:24.837
the kind of commitment,
the kind of association with

00:15:24.837 --> 00:15:29.480
the cause that only a citizen or
a subject of a king can have,

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.122
along with the skill,
and the practice,

00:15:32.122 --> 00:15:36.015
and the conditioning that is
part of being a professional

00:15:36.015 --> 00:15:39.608
soldier.
So, he has this phalanx made up

00:15:39.608 --> 00:15:43.789
of these professionals that I'm
talking about,

00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:49.496
but he added to that a group of
people called the foot

00:15:49.496 --> 00:15:54.879
companions, pezetairoi is
the Greek word,

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:59.723
who were the biggest and the
strongest of all the Macedonians

00:15:59.723 --> 00:16:03.840
and to that group he added the
companion cavalry,

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.044
the hetairoi themselves,
the companions of the king,

00:16:08.044 --> 00:16:11.813
and of course these were the
noblemen and they became

00:16:11.813 --> 00:16:16.380
personally attached to Philip in
a special way and were the most

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.917
effective,
the most reliable forces that

00:16:19.917 --> 00:16:23.934
he had, an elite core,
and here again is something

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:27.132
different.
The cavalry will play a

00:16:27.132 --> 00:16:31.791
much more important role in
fighting than it ever has in the

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:35.891
Greek fighting of the past.
One of the great geniuses of

00:16:35.891 --> 00:16:39.354
Philip would be to create a
combined force that could use

00:16:39.354 --> 00:16:42.941
cavalry and infantry and some
other subordinate forces I'll

00:16:42.941 --> 00:16:46.504
tell you about in a minute,
jointly together,

00:16:46.504 --> 00:16:50.700
to carry out a rather complex
military plan.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.762
These, of course,
are these hetairoi,

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:59.580
our aristocratic horsemen,
heavily armored on strong

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.653
horses.
That's very important as well,

00:17:02.653 --> 00:17:06.110
because if you're going to use
them as shock troops,

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.771
which he did on many an
occasion, all of that has to be

00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:12.867
in place.
Then there was another

00:17:12.867 --> 00:17:18.335
contingent of infantry with
probably less body armor than

00:17:18.335 --> 00:17:22.501
his phalanx had,
who were called the shield

00:17:22.501 --> 00:17:27.657
bearers, hypaspists,
and they occupied the center of

00:17:27.657 --> 00:17:31.480
the Macedonian line next to the
phalanx.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:35.795
These fellows were usually
the first infantry forces to

00:17:35.795 --> 00:17:40.333
follow behind a cavalry charge
if that's the way Philip fought

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:43.394
the battle,
charging a cavalry at the

00:17:43.394 --> 00:17:46.973
enemy, and as the enemy provided
opportunities,

00:17:46.973 --> 00:17:51.443
these shield bearers,
these lighter armed infantrymen

00:17:51.443 --> 00:17:56.566
would find their way and expand
the holes, opening the way for

00:17:56.566 --> 00:18:00.430
the major blow to be struck by
the phalanx.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:05.029
I'm describing one kind of
battle that could be fought.

00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:09.189
The thing about having this
kind of varied military force is

00:18:09.189 --> 00:18:13.278
that you could have different
tactics for different battles

00:18:13.278 --> 00:18:16.521
and Philip does things
differently on different

00:18:16.521 --> 00:18:18.695
occasions.
This group of

00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:21.509
hypaspists,
lighter infantry,

00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:26.494
provide a crucial link between
the first mounted attack and the

00:18:26.494 --> 00:18:31.981
follow up by the phalanx proper.
On top of all of this,

00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:37.316
you have a professional core;
again, they're all Macedonians

00:18:37.316 --> 00:18:40.890
remember, made up of really
light infantry.

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.654
That is to say,
slingers, archers,

00:18:43.654 --> 00:18:48.679
javelin men in the traditional
mode that the old Greek armies

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:51.331
had,
but didn't make too much use of

00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:55.421
typically and so that rounds out
the composite army group made up

00:18:55.421 --> 00:18:57.849
of these different kinds of
forces,

00:18:57.849 --> 00:19:02.393
and these missile men I guess
you could call them,

00:19:02.393 --> 00:19:07.678
supplied both preliminary
bombardment with the things they

00:19:07.678 --> 00:19:11.480
did to help harass the enemy
phalanx,

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.690
but also they provide a kind of
crucial reserve support.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.198
If you need to throw some
forces into a suddenly important

00:19:19.198 --> 00:19:22.891
piece of the battle these guys
were very mobile and you could

00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:26.461
order them into that place to
support whatever was going on

00:19:26.461 --> 00:19:29.305
there.
You can see how infinitely more

00:19:29.305 --> 00:19:33.380
complex this was than the kind
of fighting we've talked about

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.227
before.
Now, these Macedonian

00:19:36.227 --> 00:19:41.777
contingents I've been describing
do not represent a fragmentation

00:19:41.777 --> 00:19:45.420
of forces as might possibly be
thought,

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:52.477
but rather a diversification
and a sophistication of arms,

00:19:52.477 --> 00:19:59.164
as one historian puts it,
a symphony not a cacophony of

00:19:59.164 --> 00:20:04.725
professionally equipped men.
Philip's contribution to the

00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:08.841
history of western warfare,
therefore, is not so much

00:20:08.841 --> 00:20:11.690
tactical as it is
organizational,

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:18.163
creating this complex
organization that could have a

00:20:18.163 --> 00:20:22.540
variety of tactical uses.
Now at first,

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.853
the equipment and the tactics
of this Macedonian phalanx for

00:20:26.853 --> 00:20:29.924
itself did not differ
considerably from the

00:20:29.924 --> 00:20:33.359
traditional hoplite columns of
the Greeks,

00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:37.509
but he then subsequently made a
very important change.

00:20:37.509 --> 00:20:43.607
Now, he does keep the
spear, the pike that was the

00:20:43.607 --> 00:20:48.210
fundamental weapon of the old
phalanx.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:54.803
But it was lengthened from
being let's say roughly eight

00:20:54.803 --> 00:20:59.000
feet long to fourteen feet or
so.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.578
Now, you cannot hold a
fourteen-foot pike with one

00:21:02.578 --> 00:21:06.190
hand.
This is a two-handed weapon;

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:09.166
if you're going to control and
use it effectively that's what

00:21:09.166 --> 00:21:11.909
you have to do.
Well, if you're going to have

00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:15.641
two hands on this thing you
can't have that hoplite shield

00:21:15.641 --> 00:21:19.440
that was the characteristic of
the old hoplite phalanx.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.539
So, the shield shrank and
became unimportant.

00:21:24.539 --> 00:21:29.299
You realize that once you do
this to your hoplite phalanx,

00:21:29.299 --> 00:21:33.391
it can only function
successfully as an aggressive

00:21:33.391 --> 00:21:38.269
force, if you see what I mean.
You can't just take blows;

00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:42.259
you have to be delivering blows
all the time.

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:44.764
The greaves and the
breastplates,

00:21:44.764 --> 00:21:48.659
and the heavy head gear were
replaced either with leather

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:52.786
which was lighter,
or various composite materials,

00:21:52.786 --> 00:21:57.180
or else abandoned altogether.
So, you can see these hoplites

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.880
don't look anything like the
hoplites we're accustomed to.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:05.769
The central idea,
however, of a fighting mass of

00:22:05.769 --> 00:22:09.410
infantrymen remained
predominant.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.815
In fact, integrated with and
protected by such diverse

00:22:13.815 --> 00:22:17.390
forces, Philip's phalanx of true
pikemen,

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:22.926
their lances now allowed the
first five, not merely the first

00:22:22.926 --> 00:22:26.339
three ranks to strike at the
enemy,

00:22:26.339 --> 00:22:32.071
was both more lethal and more
versatile than the traditional

00:22:32.071 --> 00:22:35.963
hoplite columns.
The historian Polybius,

00:22:35.963 --> 00:22:41.835
who wrote in the second century
B.C., but you have to realize he

00:22:41.835 --> 00:22:46.029
was a contemporary of Macedonian
soldiers,

00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:49.616
who were still fighting
fundamentally in the same way

00:22:49.616 --> 00:22:53.390
that Philip had created,
so he knew what he was saying.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:56.335
He, for instance,
he describes the great battles

00:22:56.335 --> 00:22:59.570
between the Romans and the
Macedonians that occurred late

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.170
in the third and into the second
century.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:08.233
So, he even saw or certainly
knew about the new phalanx,

00:23:08.233 --> 00:23:13.541
the Macedonian phalanx,
tackling the Roman Legion and

00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:17.150
fighting it practically to a
standstill.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:22.179
Polybius says that infantry,
who faced such a storm of

00:23:22.179 --> 00:23:27.113
spears, as he puts it,
might have as many as ten iron

00:23:27.113 --> 00:23:34.560
points concentrated on each man.
Nothing Polybius concluded can

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.838
stand up to the phalanx.
The Roman, by himself with his

00:23:40.838 --> 00:23:46.773
sword, can neither slash down
nor break through the ten spears

00:23:46.773 --> 00:23:50.470
that all at once press against
him.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:54.694
Well, he has to face the fact
that the Roman Legion did defeat

00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:58.849
one of these phalanxes in the
course of the third century,

00:23:58.849 --> 00:24:02.717
but I think if you look at the
details you realize that there

00:24:02.717 --> 00:24:05.490
was nothing inevitable about
that defeat.

00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:10.021
Circumstances in battle
allowed the Romans to win,

00:24:10.021 --> 00:24:15.322
because it put a premium on the
great advantage that the legion

00:24:15.322 --> 00:24:19.324
had over the phalanx;
namely, that it was divided up

00:24:19.324 --> 00:24:23.241
into smaller fighting units that
could adjust and move about the

00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:27.033
field much more freely than the
fighters in the phalanx of the

00:24:27.033 --> 00:24:29.884
Macedonians.
That was certainly an edge that

00:24:29.884 --> 00:24:32.547
the legion had,
but there never was a time when

00:24:32.547 --> 00:24:35.788
a legion fighting a good
Macedonian phalanx could predict

00:24:35.788 --> 00:24:38.996
that it would win,
much less that it would be any

00:24:38.996 --> 00:24:42.254
kind of a walk over.
Of course, against the kind of

00:24:42.254 --> 00:24:45.755
forces that Philip faced,
it was all the more likely to

00:24:45.755 --> 00:24:50.359
produce a Macedonian victory,
because those were not Roman

00:24:50.359 --> 00:24:54.948
legions that they had to face.
Now, if you're going to

00:24:54.948 --> 00:24:58.723
have a national mercenary army,
a national army made up of

00:24:58.723 --> 00:25:02.705
professionals,
that means it costs money in a

00:25:02.705 --> 00:25:08.606
way that the old phalanx system
did not require the expenditure

00:25:08.606 --> 00:25:13.072
of funds very much.
So, Philip, early in his

00:25:13.072 --> 00:25:19.299
career, had to gain control of
sources of money and he did so.

00:25:19.299 --> 00:25:24.676
Early as king he immediately
had to put down his opponents

00:25:24.676 --> 00:25:29.050
from within Macedonia,
but he also did what I suppose

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:32.849
Macedonian kings always had to
do on their accession,

00:25:32.849 --> 00:25:36.386
they were surrounded by what
the Greeks called barbarian

00:25:36.386 --> 00:25:39.923
peoples and these barbarian
peoples were always fighting

00:25:39.923 --> 00:25:43.267
against the Macedonians and
trying to push back their

00:25:43.267 --> 00:25:47.468
frontiers and so on.
So Philip turned against these,

00:25:47.468 --> 00:25:52.361
the Illyrians and various other
peoples, and did an excellent

00:25:52.361 --> 00:25:55.765
job of defeating them,
driving them back,

00:25:55.765 --> 00:25:59.559
establishing the boundaries
where he wanted them.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:01.869
In the process,
accomplishing two very

00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:04.923
important things.
One was to establish his

00:26:04.923 --> 00:26:10.046
credentials as a great general
and leader for internal purposes

00:26:10.046 --> 00:26:14.425
and for military purposes is in
a sense of winning the

00:26:14.425 --> 00:26:20.769
confidence of his soldiers,
but also it meant that his own

00:26:20.769 --> 00:26:27.676
stature in general and the
reputation that he gained both

00:26:27.676 --> 00:26:34.266
among enemies and friends grew,
and finally the last point,

00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:39.325
this kind of fighting allowed
him to train his army and to

00:26:39.325 --> 00:26:43.264
create this army,
and to make it as excellent as

00:26:43.264 --> 00:26:47.450
it became before he had to face
more formidable forces than

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.745
these.
So, now he has won the loyalty

00:26:50.745 --> 00:26:55.859
of his nobility to a degree that
no predecessor ever had.

00:26:55.859 --> 00:26:59.269
He now has these barons who are
so independent,

00:26:59.269 --> 00:27:03.789
happily, gladly serving him and
being rather in awe of him,

00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:08.392
and the army in general was
devoted to him in a way that was

00:27:08.392 --> 00:27:11.200
unprecedented for the
Macedonians.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:16.594
Now, with this weapon
largely forged he was able to

00:27:16.594 --> 00:27:21.089
begin serious expansion in the
Greek world.

00:27:21.089 --> 00:27:26.371
A critical step rather early in
his monarchy was his attack on

00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:30.873
Amphipolis, and you will
remember Amphipolis was this

00:27:30.873 --> 00:27:36.241
Athenian colony that was such a
big deal for the Athenians that

00:27:36.241 --> 00:27:41.609
they were prepared to do almost
anything to get it back,

00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:45.065
but they never had thoroughly
been able to get it back until

00:27:45.065 --> 00:27:46.875
recently.
So, now he took

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:51.225
Amphipolis--what was more
important than anything for him

00:27:51.225 --> 00:27:55.109
was that who held Amphipolis was
likely to hold Mt.

00:27:55.109 --> 00:27:59.769
Pangaean which is right near
Amphipolis, which contained gold

00:27:59.769 --> 00:28:03.964
and silver mines that were
producing wealth as they had

00:28:03.964 --> 00:28:08.835
been for centuries now,
and now that wealth was going

00:28:08.835 --> 00:28:14.100
into Philip's pocket and he used
it for the purpose that was most

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.616
important,
chiefly for paying for that

00:28:17.616 --> 00:28:20.970
army that I have been talking
about.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.439
We are told that this
produced about 1,000 talents a

00:28:24.439 --> 00:28:27.403
year for Philip's use,
and that's about the same

00:28:27.403 --> 00:28:30.809
amount that the Athenians got
out of their empire.

00:28:30.809 --> 00:28:34.767
So, you are talking about lots
and lots of money and this

00:28:34.767 --> 00:28:39.008
explains the economic capacity
that gave Philip the chance to

00:28:39.008 --> 00:28:44.206
use the kind of army he had.
But he was extraordinarily

00:28:44.206 --> 00:28:48.160
skillful at the game of
diplomacy.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.190
I say game, because he treated
it in that way.

00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:56.144
Diplomacy, I think,
for him was an extension of

00:28:56.144 --> 00:28:59.240
military forces by peaceful
means.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.503
It's kind of a standing
Clausewitz's definition of war

00:29:03.503 --> 00:29:06.779
on its head.
Who was it?

00:29:06.779 --> 00:29:10.708
Sir John Fortescue,
I think, it was in the

00:29:10.708 --> 00:29:16.073
fifteenth century defined a
diplomat as a man sent to lie

00:29:16.073 --> 00:29:20.863
abroad for his country.
I think the spirit behind that

00:29:20.863 --> 00:29:25.051
pun was certainly right for
Philip, that for him diplomacy

00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:29.312
was a way for advancing his
country's interests by whatever

00:29:29.312 --> 00:29:33.299
means that he possibly could;
he was very good.

00:29:33.299 --> 00:29:38.019
One of his very great
skills was precisely to lie in a

00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:42.266
very convincing manner and,
of course, it's much easier to

00:29:42.266 --> 00:29:45.529
get people to believe what you
say if you have got the

00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:48.977
strongest army anywhere in sight
in case you should be so

00:29:48.977 --> 00:29:51.440
impolite as to say "you're a
liar."

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.750
I think that must have assisted
him.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:57.708
But what I mean is Philip would
come into conflict with some

00:29:57.708 --> 00:30:00.593
polis or some
poleis over some

00:30:00.593 --> 00:30:03.680
territory that was in dispute or
whatever,

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.750
and they would say Philip what
are you trying to do,

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.759
you seem to be trying to
conquer this territory.

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:12.946
Oh no, no Philip said,
I have absolutely no interest

00:30:12.946 --> 00:30:15.758
in this territory,
I've got other things to do

00:30:15.758 --> 00:30:19.054
that are much more important.
Those Paeonians in my

00:30:19.054 --> 00:30:22.581
background require my attention
and when the other guys would

00:30:22.581 --> 00:30:25.873
calm down he would calmly take
the place that he had left

00:30:25.873 --> 00:30:28.322
alone.
I'm reminded,

00:30:28.322 --> 00:30:34.578
and I guess after the Second
World War, in fact even before,

00:30:34.578 --> 00:30:40.833
there were some scholars who
made the analogy between Hitler

00:30:40.833 --> 00:30:45.068
and Philip,
and Demosthenes and Churchill,

00:30:45.068 --> 00:30:48.165
it's not the worst one.
It's very imperfect,

00:30:48.165 --> 00:30:51.413
but it's not the worst analogy
possible, but I remember Hitler

00:30:51.413 --> 00:30:54.449
kept saying before his strength
was great enough simply to

00:30:54.449 --> 00:30:58.650
launch a major war he would say,
if you give me this that's all

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:01.921
I'm interested in,
that is absolutely my last

00:31:01.921 --> 00:31:06.168
territorial demand in Europe,
and then in a few months he

00:31:06.168 --> 00:31:09.559
would then seize Austria or
something like that.

00:31:09.559 --> 00:31:13.934
So, Philip reminds me of that,
because he did such things from

00:31:13.934 --> 00:31:15.010
time to time.

00:31:19.009 --> 00:31:22.758
It's just too much to tell in
terms of the detail of his

00:31:22.758 --> 00:31:26.846
career, but let me just hit a
few highlights and give you the

00:31:26.846 --> 00:31:31.630
direction in which it was going.
The first business that he

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:36.058
had to do after he gained
Amphipolis and the wealth of the

00:31:36.058 --> 00:31:41.030
mines was to gain control of the
shoreline of the northern Aegean

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:44.109
Sea,
and that meant of course his

00:31:44.109 --> 00:31:46.404
own Macedonia,
which he had,

00:31:46.404 --> 00:31:50.400
but also eastward into the
region of Thrace.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.650
He began precisely to gain
control of those places.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:32:00.471
It was in 357 that he took
Amphipolis and that meant that

00:32:00.471 --> 00:32:04.846
he had to clash with Athens,
because as I say,

00:32:04.846 --> 00:32:09.061
Athens had never given up its
claim to Amphipolis and kept

00:32:09.061 --> 00:32:13.126
trying to get it back,
because of its value to the

00:32:13.126 --> 00:32:17.715
Athenians.
What we will see is war between

00:32:17.715 --> 00:32:24.134
Philip and Athens on and off
until the final victory of

00:32:24.134 --> 00:32:27.272
Macedonia.
It's a period of quite a

00:32:27.272 --> 00:32:30.589
stretch of time in here in which
that's going on.

00:32:30.589 --> 00:32:34.047
On the other hand,
it's never a full scale war

00:32:34.047 --> 00:32:36.800
with Philip trying to conquer
Athens.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.751
How could he?
He's still outside from a

00:32:39.751 --> 00:32:43.513
territorial point of view,
outside the entire old Greek

00:32:43.513 --> 00:32:46.526
world.
But he can cause all the havoc

00:32:46.526 --> 00:32:51.219
he wants to in the northern
Aegean and the Athenians will be

00:32:51.219 --> 00:32:54.648
unhappy about it;
they will send forces up into

00:32:54.648 --> 00:32:58.134
that part of the world to
contest Philip's expansion and

00:32:58.134 --> 00:33:00.480
that's where the fighting goes
on.

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.688
But the Athenians are not ready
to take him on and really try to

00:33:05.688 --> 00:33:09.740
stop him from going where he
seems to be going.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.612
What they do is they respond
when he does something that

00:33:12.612 --> 00:33:14.910
annoys them or that they're
worried about.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:19.605
Sometimes they go out and fight
him, but usually they don't,

00:33:19.605 --> 00:33:24.539
or sometimes they do and they
do so too little and too late.

00:33:24.539 --> 00:33:28.483
That's the story of the
relationship between these two

00:33:28.483 --> 00:33:31.980
powers throughout this whole
stretch of time.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:36.906
With the expansion of
Philip in a variety of

00:33:36.906 --> 00:33:43.299
directions, he increases his
revenues wherever he conquers.

00:33:43.299 --> 00:33:46.545
He gets down into Thessaly,
now we're talking about

00:33:46.545 --> 00:33:50.245
territory that the Greeks
consider to be Greece and Philip

00:33:50.245 --> 00:33:53.750
is now gaining more and more
control of that area.

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.832
The revenues grow and he even
builds a navy and begins to

00:33:58.832 --> 00:34:02.190
challenge Athens and others at
sea.

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:06.564
He attacks Athenian commerce
when he is quarreling with the

00:34:06.564 --> 00:34:09.939
Athenians.
The Athenian position in

00:34:09.939 --> 00:34:16.111
general is badly weakened in the
years between 357 and 355 in

00:34:16.111 --> 00:34:21.769
what the traditional historians
call the Social War.

00:34:21.769 --> 00:34:26.171
That doesn't mean that they
fought over teacups or anything

00:34:26.171 --> 00:34:30.724
like that, "social" derives from
the Latin word socii,

00:34:30.724 --> 00:34:35.279
which means allies.
It was a rebellion against

00:34:35.279 --> 00:34:40.150
the allies of Athens in the
Athenian Confederation,

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:44.869
which really frightened the
Athenians, and kept them busy

00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:48.239
putting it down for a couple of
years.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:53.183
There is some debate among
scholars today as to how

00:34:53.183 --> 00:34:58.719
oppressive or not was the
Athenian rule of its empire.

00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:04.245
The more recent scholarship has
suggested that the Athenians

00:35:04.245 --> 00:35:08.764
were not really very oppressive,
which leaves for,

00:35:08.764 --> 00:35:12.138
I think, for them an
uncomfortable question,

00:35:12.138 --> 00:35:16.768
if that's true why was there
this rebellion in the years 357

00:35:16.768 --> 00:35:19.153
to 355?
We just don't know enough to

00:35:19.153 --> 00:35:21.782
talk details about this,
but I think there can be no

00:35:21.782 --> 00:35:23.927
mistake;
the Athenians abused their

00:35:23.927 --> 00:35:26.840
position of power and leadership
in the empire.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:30.420
They didn't do so as thoroughly
and completely as they did in

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:33.881
the great Athenian Empire of the
fifth century but that was

00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:38.145
largely because they couldn't.
They never had the power,

00:35:38.145 --> 00:35:43.242
they never had the financial
strength to be able to impose

00:35:43.242 --> 00:35:46.820
their will as the earlier empire
had,

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.438
but they did what they could
and they did enough to annoy

00:35:50.438 --> 00:35:52.829
their allies into such a
rebellion.

00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:56.223
Athens recovers,
they win, they put down the

00:35:56.223 --> 00:35:59.473
allied rebellion,
but they are weakened in the

00:35:59.473 --> 00:36:03.366
process.
In 356, there breaks out on the

00:36:03.366 --> 00:36:08.246
mainland of Greece,
what they would call the Sacred

00:36:08.246 --> 00:36:11.602
War.
It's the old business of who

00:36:11.602 --> 00:36:15.559
controls the Delphic Oracle.
The neighbors,

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:19.215
Phocis, Locris,
frequently take advantage of

00:36:19.215 --> 00:36:24.400
opportunities to gain control of
the oracle and to deprive the

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.139
priests of their control of the
region.

00:36:28.139 --> 00:36:32.715
The priests then call on other
Greeks traditionally led by

00:36:32.715 --> 00:36:37.691
Sparta but not always to beat up
the people who have taken over

00:36:37.691 --> 00:36:42.346
the oracle's place and drive
them out and restore it to the

00:36:42.346 --> 00:36:45.433
priest.
Well, this is another in that

00:36:45.433 --> 00:36:47.829
theory, in that series of
events.

00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:54.369
Thebes and Phocis are involved
in a war over Delphi.

00:36:54.369 --> 00:36:59.234
The Phocian general is the only
time he crops us in this story,

00:36:59.234 --> 00:37:03.864
Onomarchus apparently was an
outstanding military leader and

00:37:03.864 --> 00:37:08.179
defeated the Thebans and even
pushed into Thessaly,

00:37:08.179 --> 00:37:13.351
and that brings Philip into the
picture, because Philip has been

00:37:13.351 --> 00:37:18.359
expanding Macedonian power into
Thessaly from the north coming

00:37:18.359 --> 00:37:21.498
south.
So, Philip takes his forces

00:37:21.498 --> 00:37:25.313
and he pushes the Phocians back,
defeats Onomarchus,

00:37:25.313 --> 00:37:28.320
sends them off.
Now, here's the question.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.190
Is this good or bad for the
Greeks?

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.477
On the one hand the one thought
would be well,

00:37:34.477 --> 00:37:38.859
sure he's just put down this
fellow who has arrogantly seized

00:37:38.859 --> 00:37:42.271
the Delphic Oracle,
but now who is there,

00:37:42.271 --> 00:37:46.639
who is sitting in Thessaly,
this great big new army.

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:51.880
Is he going to be a menace to
the Greeks in general?

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.722
Well, we who have had a chance
to know how it came out and know

00:37:55.722 --> 00:37:58.381
that it did.
But at the time people were

00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:02.494
divided, some say oh my heavens
this is a thoroughly aggressive

00:38:02.494 --> 00:38:06.542
man at the head of an army that
looks incredibly strong and he

00:38:06.542 --> 00:38:10.195
has terrific ambitions,
what are we going to do,

00:38:10.195 --> 00:38:12.888
against those who said,
no it's okay,

00:38:12.888 --> 00:38:15.700
he's okay now,
he's happy, he doesn't want to

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.900
do anymore than that.
Let's take a look at

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.902
Athens, which will necessarily
be the leading figure in the

00:38:23.902 --> 00:38:27.179
opposition to Philip such as it
is.

00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:31.077
Thebes, last time we looked at
Thebes, Thebes had reached a

00:38:31.077 --> 00:38:34.840
position of power perhaps
greater than that of Athens,

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:39.682
but you remember the deaths of
Pelopidas and Epaminondas simply

00:38:39.682 --> 00:38:44.603
did not allow Thebes to continue
to have that vitality and power

00:38:44.603 --> 00:38:48.760
that it had before.
It's still a very strong state.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.159
Its hoplite phalanx is still
formidable;

00:38:52.159 --> 00:38:56.908
they still have great ambitions
and so on, but it turns out they

00:38:56.908 --> 00:39:01.130
don't really have the capacity
to take the lead in such a

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:04.028
business.
The Athenians do and they are

00:39:04.028 --> 00:39:06.940
very much concerned about what's
happening.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.443
But it's not the same Athens
that we saw in the height of its

00:39:11.443 --> 00:39:15.927
power in the fifth century.
Relatively speaking,

00:39:15.927 --> 00:39:20.809
it is a very poor place indeed.
It is, however,

00:39:20.809 --> 00:39:25.090
still the number one naval
power in the Greek world and

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.057
therefore very important.
Let's take a look at the

00:39:29.057 --> 00:39:33.053
internal life of Athens a little
bit and notice some changes they

00:39:33.053 --> 00:39:36.611
will have some significance in
terms of what decisions the

00:39:36.611 --> 00:39:39.327
Athenians make.
There is something that was

00:39:39.327 --> 00:39:42.752
introduced -- we don't know just
when -- it might have been late

00:39:42.752 --> 00:39:45.960
in the Peloponnesian War it,
might have been afterwards.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:51.495
It is called the theoric
fund, and it gets its name

00:39:51.495 --> 00:39:57.515
apparently because there was a
payment to the Athenian citizens

00:39:57.515 --> 00:40:03.342
of the price necessary to pay
for the ticket to see the great

00:40:03.342 --> 00:40:09.460
theatrical festivals that went
on twice a year in Athens,

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:14.327
which had apparently
degenerated pretty much into a

00:40:14.327 --> 00:40:19.780
dole, into a kind of a welfare
fund for the very poor.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.161
It did not amount to a stunning
amount of money,

00:40:23.161 --> 00:40:26.400
but given the poverty of Athens
in general,

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:32.159
any fund of money could be very
significant at critical moments,

00:40:32.159 --> 00:40:36.090
especially on issues of
national defense.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.854
But there was a lot of
argument, a sort of a democratic

00:40:39.854 --> 00:40:43.360
party, the party of the
underprivileged or whatever,

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.200
always insistent that
everybody's supposed to keep

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.562
hands off the theoric
fund which should only be used

00:40:49.562 --> 00:40:52.808
for its welfare state--I'm
embarrassed to use such a term

00:40:52.808 --> 00:40:56.228
because of course there was
nothing like that in the ancient

00:40:56.228 --> 00:40:59.107
world.
Just for that portion of the

00:40:59.107 --> 00:41:03.833
national income that was used to
alleviate the worst poverty they

00:41:03.833 --> 00:41:08.179
wanted that untouched,
but when the state was under

00:41:08.179 --> 00:41:13.000
siege, it was under threat,
it was--had to go to war,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.773
so it seemed to some
politicians, they needed money

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:18.991
to do it and say let's take the
theoric fund for now

00:41:18.991 --> 00:41:22.319
while we have this necessity and
there would be a fight about

00:41:22.319 --> 00:41:22.930
that.

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.550
You remember the Athenian
Empire in the fifth century?

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:32.208
Never had a money--not never,
but could generally handle its

00:41:32.208 --> 00:41:35.557
money problem because it had
this great income from the

00:41:35.557 --> 00:41:37.966
empire,
say roughly 1,000 talents a

00:41:37.966 --> 00:41:41.690
year coming in.
That was not true.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:48.087
So, that if Athens wanted to
send an expedition anywhere,

00:41:48.087 --> 00:41:52.199
they had to levy a direct war
tax;

00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:54.280
it was called the
eisphora.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.173
They had done so two or three
times during the Peloponnesian

00:41:58.173 --> 00:41:59.919
War.
As far as we know they had

00:41:59.919 --> 00:42:04.482
never done it before that time.
We have stressed how unnatural

00:42:04.482 --> 00:42:10.675
direct taxation was in the Greek
world, but here that's what they

00:42:10.675 --> 00:42:13.400
really had.
They had to pay this

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.512
eisphora, if they were
going to conduct a military and

00:42:17.512 --> 00:42:20.869
naval campaigns that they felt
were necessary.

00:42:20.869 --> 00:42:25.332
In fact, it used to be true
that individual Greeks back in

00:42:25.332 --> 00:42:28.619
the fifth century could pay
their share,

00:42:28.619 --> 00:42:31.806
what was assigned to them for
the eisphora,

00:42:31.806 --> 00:42:34.667
individually,
but now they were so few people

00:42:34.667 --> 00:42:38.633
who could do that they organized
groups of taxpayers whom they

00:42:38.633 --> 00:42:42.340
called symmories who
would share the burden.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:47.198
It makes me think that it
probably sank further down

00:42:47.198 --> 00:42:51.199
the--sort of the wealth class of
Athens.

00:42:51.199 --> 00:42:55.349
More people I guess were now
paying taxes than before.

00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:58.769
In the fifth century the
only people who paid taxes were

00:42:58.769 --> 00:43:02.305
the very wealthy and now that I
think was attenuated as people

00:43:02.305 --> 00:43:05.610
who were not so wealthy had to
pay something as well.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:10.069
Another thing is that we find
the Athenians using,

00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:15.439
as a regular thing in these
campaigns that they will have to

00:43:15.439 --> 00:43:20.254
fight, mercenary soldiers.
I don't mean mercenaries of the

00:43:20.254 --> 00:43:23.550
Macedonian kind,
the kind that Philip was using.

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:28.258
I mean hiring a band of
mercenaries who might come from

00:43:28.258 --> 00:43:33.218
anyplace in Greece.
That was because the Athenians

00:43:33.218 --> 00:43:38.639
were reluctant themselves to go
out on expeditions.

00:43:38.639 --> 00:43:42.020
Nothing could be more different
I think from the way the

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:45.769
Athenians behaved in the fifth
century when they were all over

00:43:45.769 --> 00:43:47.881
the joint,
as you remember,

00:43:47.881 --> 00:43:52.572
in 457 that inscription that
talked about those died from one

00:43:52.572 --> 00:43:56.287
tribe all over the battle.
They were proud of it and they

00:43:56.287 --> 00:43:58.845
never ran short of soldiers
willing to do this kind of

00:43:58.845 --> 00:44:00.949
thing.
The assembly voted it and the

00:44:00.949 --> 00:44:03.260
people win.
Not now.

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.180
The Athenians are reluctant
to engage in these activities.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:14.061
Our main source for complaint
about this is Demosthenes,

00:44:14.061 --> 00:44:17.464
who much of the time is
pleading with the Athenians to

00:44:17.464 --> 00:44:21.316
recognize the danger presented
by Philip and for them to take

00:44:21.316 --> 00:44:25.489
the necessary steps to check
Philip before it was too late.

00:44:25.489 --> 00:44:29.978
What he asked them to do
repeatedly was to first of all

00:44:29.978 --> 00:44:33.885
vote the money that was
necessary to support the

00:44:33.885 --> 00:44:38.456
expedition and then not to hire
mercenaries but to serve

00:44:38.456 --> 00:44:43.370
themselves in the fighting,
and he did not win those

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:48.117
arguments very often.
There were in Athens throughout

00:44:48.117 --> 00:44:53.809
this period people that we would
call in our own jargon hawks and

00:44:53.809 --> 00:44:57.348
doves;
people who were ready to fight

00:44:57.348 --> 00:45:02.642
for these purposes and people
who were very reluctant to do

00:45:02.642 --> 00:45:06.718
so.
The people who seemed to be the

00:45:06.718 --> 00:45:12.409
most reluctant to do this were
the upper classes,

00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:17.106
of course, because war meant
taxation and they were going to

00:45:17.106 --> 00:45:20.369
do the bulk of the paying of the
taxes.

00:45:20.369 --> 00:45:25.261
It may well be--I don't
want to make too much of this,

00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:30.496
Philip, wherever he could would
install oligarchic governments

00:45:30.496 --> 00:45:34.703
in places that he ruled.
He was not interested in

00:45:34.703 --> 00:45:37.076
democracy;
he was not a friend of

00:45:37.076 --> 00:45:40.312
democracy.
There were some Athenians who

00:45:40.312 --> 00:45:44.983
had never given up their hope
that an oligarchy could be

00:45:44.983 --> 00:45:48.889
placed into Athens,
instead of a democracy.

00:45:48.889 --> 00:45:53.650
They would have been doves and
more.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:58.015
I mean, there is a pretty clear
indication that Philip did in

00:45:58.015 --> 00:46:01.289
Athens what he did in other
states as well.

00:46:01.289 --> 00:46:06.402
He bribed important Athenians
to be champions of his cause and

00:46:06.402 --> 00:46:11.599
the people it's easiest to get
this to work with are people who

00:46:11.599 --> 00:46:15.368
agree with your approach,
who on your side of the

00:46:15.368 --> 00:46:18.460
argument.
So, there was some of that.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:22.665
I mean, there was a real
difference of opinion as there

00:46:22.665 --> 00:46:25.509
always is.
We should be very aware of

00:46:25.509 --> 00:46:29.199
it and in recent years this is
the kind of thing you see.

00:46:29.199 --> 00:46:34.075
Some people in society seeing a
great danger out there that must

00:46:34.075 --> 00:46:38.549
be prepared for and confronted,
others thinking that that is

00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:42.387
overblown, that that is too
pessimistic, that there is no

00:46:42.387 --> 00:46:46.019
such great danger or that it can
best be dealt with by

00:46:46.019 --> 00:46:50.340
negotiation and conversation,
and anything but fighting,

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.250
and that was the situation in
Athens.

00:46:57.679 --> 00:47:00.713
If you were hostile,
if you were a member of the

00:47:00.713 --> 00:47:03.360
hawk faction,
you would say your opponents

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.104
were deluding themselves about
the degree of the danger and

00:47:07.104 --> 00:47:10.590
that Philip was a very special
kind of a menace.

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:14.905
If you were a dove you would
accuse your opponents of being

00:47:14.905 --> 00:47:18.030
alarmists, excessively afraid
and worse.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:22.220
Of course, both sides accused
each other of much worse things

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.293
having to do with their
characters and so on,

00:47:25.293 --> 00:47:29.912
as people always do.
The first statement we have

00:47:29.912 --> 00:47:34.279
of Demosthenes,
who will emerge as the dominant

00:47:34.279 --> 00:47:39.975
hawk for most of the time that
he is doing business in Athens

00:47:39.975 --> 00:47:43.475
is in 351,
when he delivers the speech

00:47:43.475 --> 00:47:46.090
that we call the First
Philippic.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:50.516
He delivered a series of
speeches attacking Philip and

00:47:50.516 --> 00:47:55.360
warning the Athenians of the
danger presented by Philip.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.757
To this day,
philippic is a word in English

00:47:59.757 --> 00:48:06.039
which means a strong attacking
piece of rhetoric against some

00:48:06.039 --> 00:48:11.295
individual or some nation.
He charged the Athenians with

00:48:11.295 --> 00:48:15.890
having created the great danger
that they faced by making Philip

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:20.266
into a great man through neglect
by their refusal to stop him

00:48:20.266 --> 00:48:23.329
when it was relatively easy to
do so.

00:48:23.329 --> 00:48:26.231
They should send,
he thought, a fleet,

00:48:26.231 --> 00:48:30.935
a good-sized fleet to serve in
the northern Aegean Sea and to

00:48:30.935 --> 00:48:35.170
stop Philip's expansion and to
stop Philip period.

00:48:35.170 --> 00:48:37.697
He urged them,
and he will do this over and

00:48:37.697 --> 00:48:40.374
over again.
Don't hire mercenaries,

00:48:40.374 --> 00:48:44.079
enlist for service yourself,
vote for war tax,

00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:48.280
and those of you who should pay
it should do so.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.378
He lost the argument.
The Athenians did not take

00:48:52.378 --> 00:48:58.037
that action that he recommended.
Philip, pretty soon after that,

00:48:58.037 --> 00:49:03.304
attacked the Olynthians;
you remember Olynthus is an

00:49:03.304 --> 00:49:07.239
important state on the Chalcidic
Peninsula;

00:49:07.239 --> 00:49:11.013
it has been a very significant
state back in this century you

00:49:11.013 --> 00:49:14.346
remember when the Spartans went
up there to defeat the

00:49:14.346 --> 00:49:17.679
Olynthians who had constructed a
league of their.

00:49:17.679 --> 00:49:19.860
Well, they weren't out of
business yet.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:25.645
So, Philip went after them and,
again, Demosthenes urges the

00:49:25.645 --> 00:49:31.332
Athenians to get involved and to
prevent Philip from taking

00:49:31.332 --> 00:49:37.019
Olynthus an the Chalcidic states
and gaining control of the

00:49:37.019 --> 00:49:42.902
northern Aegean Sea and all the
danger that that presented to

00:49:42.902 --> 00:49:50.730
Athenian interests.
Again, he loses the argument.

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:55.037
He delivers three Olynthiac
speeches which have the same

00:49:55.037 --> 00:49:59.423
character as the one I've
described, but the Athenians do

00:49:59.423 --> 00:50:03.143
not do it.
In the year 348 Olynthus

00:50:03.143 --> 00:50:08.280
falls.
That city and the other cities

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:14.900
of the region were destroyed.
You remember this is not a

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:19.840
typical way in which the Greeks
dealt with defeated states,

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:22.706
although heaven knows the
Peloponnesian War had seen

00:50:22.706 --> 00:50:24.730
examples of it,
but it was a very,

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:28.860
very harsh kind of warfare that
Philip carried forward.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:33.690
He destroyed the cities
physically, he enslaved what was

00:50:33.690 --> 00:50:38.170
left of the population and so
this was a message.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:41.024
I think it wasn't just that he
had a cruel temperament,

00:50:41.024 --> 00:50:43.244
though I suppose he must have
had that too,

00:50:43.244 --> 00:50:45.199
but it was meant to be
exemplary.

00:50:45.199 --> 00:50:48.674
It was meant to say when Philip
says do this,

00:50:48.674 --> 00:50:53.176
do it, because if you don't,
he will crush you and this is

00:50:53.176 --> 00:50:56.730
what will happen to your city
and to you.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:00.725
That's an old technique.
We know that the Assyrians used

00:51:00.725 --> 00:51:04.347
to do that way back in biblical
times in which they would

00:51:04.347 --> 00:51:07.969
deliberately be as brutal and
cruel as they could be,

00:51:07.969 --> 00:51:11.401
and having done so would
broadcast how brutal and cruel

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:14.006
they had been,
in order to encourage other

00:51:14.006 --> 00:51:17.119
states to behave appropriately
in the future.

00:51:17.119 --> 00:51:21.586
Hitler had used those same
tactics early in the Second

00:51:21.586 --> 00:51:26.679
World War when he destroyed the
city of Rotterdam from the air,

00:51:26.679 --> 00:51:30.429
completely not military
whatsoever.

00:51:30.429 --> 00:51:35.364
It was obviously intended to
terrify everybody who might want

00:51:35.364 --> 00:51:39.281
to resist him.
So, that's what Philip did up

00:51:39.281 --> 00:51:42.203
there.
Finally after further fighting

00:51:42.203 --> 00:51:46.179
of one kind or another,
the Athenians and a number of

00:51:46.179 --> 00:51:49.389
other Greeks make a treaty with
Philip.

00:51:49.389 --> 00:51:52.940
It is called the Peace of
Philocrates;

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:57.110
he was one of the negotiators
on the Athenian team.

00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:00.766
There really didn't seem to be
much disagreement among the

00:52:00.766 --> 00:52:03.909
Athenians as to the desirability
of this peace,

00:52:03.909 --> 00:52:07.160
even Demosthenes who is
normally opposed to anything

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.219
like it, felt that it probably
had to be done,

00:52:10.219 --> 00:52:13.840
and I think that just reflected
the realities of the

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.746
distribution of power and also
of the willingness of the

00:52:17.746 --> 00:52:20.869
Athenians to do anything more
than that,

00:52:20.869 --> 00:52:24.801
and so there is this period of
the Peace of Philocrates in

00:52:24.801 --> 00:52:28.940
which the Athenians make a
defensive alliance with Philip.

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:34.769
There things sit when
another development raises the

00:52:34.769 --> 00:52:39.114
panic button,
I think, for Demosthenes and

00:52:39.114 --> 00:52:42.425
some others.
The Sacred War,

00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:46.409
there's another Sacred War
going on.

00:52:46.409 --> 00:52:53.201
This time the people who want
to restore power to the priests

00:52:53.201 --> 00:52:59.880
invite Philip to lead the Greek
forces in the Sacred War.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:03.891
That is a very big deal.
First of all,

00:53:03.891 --> 00:53:10.700
it recognizes the Macedonians
as Greeks in the truest sense of

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.658
the word.
It should have been,

00:53:13.658 --> 00:53:17.136
probably was,
a major source of satisfaction

00:53:17.136 --> 00:53:21.910
for Philip and extraordinary
glory in the eyes of his fellow

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:26.360
Macedonians that the Greeks
should have done this.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.226
Not only accepted them as
Hellenes, but asked them to save

00:53:30.226 --> 00:53:33.481
the Oracle of Apollo,
the center of Greek worship

00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:36.288
there.
So, he takes his army,

00:53:36.288 --> 00:53:41.414
he runs into the Phocians,
blasts the Phocian army and

00:53:41.414 --> 00:53:45.957
does what he was asked to do.
In the process,

00:53:45.957 --> 00:53:50.396
when it's all over,
he decides that from now on

00:53:50.396 --> 00:53:55.897
Macedon and King Philip will
take not just one vote on the

00:53:55.897 --> 00:54:00.239
council that governs the Delphic
Oracle.

00:54:00.239 --> 00:54:05.461
I may have mentioned it to you
earlier in the semester,

00:54:05.461 --> 00:54:10.779
the Amphictyonic Council,
the council of those who dwell

00:54:10.779 --> 00:54:14.642
around Delphi.
He took two votes on that

00:54:14.642 --> 00:54:19.735
council, and he made himself
president of the Pythian Games--

00:54:19.735 --> 00:54:23.469
you remember these panhellenic
festivals.

00:54:23.469 --> 00:54:26.370
There were four great
panhellenic festivals,

00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:28.900
Olympia, Nemea,
the isthmus of Corinth,

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:33.945
and the one at Delphi which was
called the Pythian Games and

00:54:33.945 --> 00:54:38.734
here is this barbarian from
Macedonia not only sitting on

00:54:38.734 --> 00:54:42.070
the council but being the
chairman,

00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:48.019
holding the position of honor
as all the Greeks gather for the

00:54:48.019 --> 00:54:52.069
Pythian Games.
Well, this must have had an

00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:57.510
enormously intimidating effect
on many in the Greek world,

00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:02.944
and it becomes more and more
Athens that has to take the

00:55:02.944 --> 00:55:06.700
lead, if anybody is going to
resist.

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:10.524
The Athenians were concerned;
at least those who were not

00:55:10.524 --> 00:55:13.349
determined to accept the course
of events.

00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:18.465
Phillip was very careful with
Athens, for this there was a

00:55:18.465 --> 00:55:22.159
very good reason.
They had a special strategic

00:55:22.159 --> 00:55:26.208
set of advantages that nobody
else in the Greek world had,

00:55:26.208 --> 00:55:29.760
and that Philip didn't have an
easy answer for.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:36.016
Athens was a walled city
which had proven itself capable

00:55:36.016 --> 00:55:42.050
of defending those walls.
You should realize that up to

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:48.064
this point in Greek history,
nobody has demonstrated any

00:55:48.064 --> 00:55:53.750
kind of ability of taking a
walled city by force,

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:56.787
the only way you can take a
walled city is by surrounding it

00:55:56.787 --> 00:55:59.999
and starving it out,
but you remember now that the

00:55:59.999 --> 00:56:04.302
Athenians have a navy and walls,
they can't be starved out in

00:56:04.302 --> 00:56:07.034
the same way.
So, taking on Athens,

00:56:07.034 --> 00:56:11.260
if you really want to take the
city, is a job that's very

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.633
difficult indeed.
Of course, the Athenians have

00:56:14.633 --> 00:56:17.973
their navy which makes that
true, but also allows the

00:56:17.973 --> 00:56:22.150
Athenians to do you harm in a
way that other states cannot do.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:26.188
So, all of that means that
Philip is not about to make a

00:56:26.188 --> 00:56:30.300
headlong assault on Athens,
but to try to have his way by

00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:35.078
going around Athens somehow.
He tried to win Athenian

00:56:35.078 --> 00:56:39.327
support through his usual
technique of soft words,

00:56:39.327 --> 00:56:44.010
explaining how he had no
aggressive intentions in areas

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:47.739
that the Athenians were
interested in,

00:56:47.739 --> 00:56:50.568
even though he had already
demonstrated that that wasn't

00:56:50.568 --> 00:56:52.962
right.
Also by working Athenian

00:56:52.962 --> 00:56:57.754
politics, by bribing Athenian
politicians to be on his side

00:56:57.754 --> 00:57:02.380
and using every device he could
to make it harder for the

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:05.519
hawkish people to have their
way.

00:57:05.519 --> 00:57:10.556
Demosthenes from here on in is
determined, and determinedly

00:57:10.556 --> 00:57:14.204
against Philip,
spending all his energy and

00:57:14.204 --> 00:57:18.719
time trying to get up Athenian
support and then,

00:57:18.719 --> 00:57:22.964
indeed, to put together a
coalition of states besides

00:57:22.964 --> 00:57:26.800
Athens to resist and fight and
defeat Philip.

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.159
Indeed, he is more successful
than he was before,

00:57:30.159 --> 00:57:33.730
because the danger from Philip
is obviously greater,

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:37.019
so that more Athenians can see
it that way.

00:57:37.019 --> 00:57:41.636
The league he puts together
includes Euboea,

00:57:41.636 --> 00:57:45.071
Megara, Achaea,
Acarnania, Lucas,

00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:49.576
Phocis, and finally Thebes.
Now, that's a pretty good

00:57:49.576 --> 00:57:51.192
trick.
Phocis and Thebes are

00:57:51.192 --> 00:57:54.493
traditional opponents,
but they're both in the league

00:57:54.493 --> 00:57:57.539
and what that tells you is that
those states,

00:57:57.539 --> 00:58:01.674
and especially those states
which are in central Greece,

00:58:01.674 --> 00:58:05.734
closest to where Philip is
located with his forces into

00:58:05.734 --> 00:58:09.944
Thessaly and so they now see
that there is a great danger

00:58:09.944 --> 00:58:14.230
from him and they join in an
anti-Philip coalition.

00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:18.909
He doesn't go at them
immediately directly;

00:58:18.909 --> 00:58:25.205
he goes to war but he does so
up in the north on the shores of

00:58:25.205 --> 00:58:29.009
the Aegean Sea.
He moves eastward--this is an

00:58:29.009 --> 00:58:33.108
enormously clever thing to do,
towards what the Greeks call

00:58:33.108 --> 00:58:36.513
the Chersonese,
the peninsula which we call the

00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:39.059
Gallipoli Peninsula,
the Hellespont.

00:58:39.059 --> 00:58:43.761
Philip wants to gain control of
that, because if he can control

00:58:43.761 --> 00:58:46.332
the Hellespont,
it's the old story,

00:58:46.332 --> 00:58:49.842
he can cut off trade,
he can starve Athens out and it

00:58:49.842 --> 00:58:53.960
would hurt others too but Athens
would be the main attack.

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.019
So, he moves forces to the
Thracian coast,

00:58:57.019 --> 00:59:00.622
taking various cities there,
and gaining more and more

00:59:00.622 --> 00:59:05.267
territory towards that end,
and then he goes all the way

00:59:05.267 --> 00:59:10.159
across to the Bosporus to
Byzantium, modern Istanbul,

00:59:10.159 --> 00:59:13.183
and he takes that city as well,
and, of course,

00:59:13.183 --> 00:59:16.075
you can cut off trade,
if you can control the

00:59:16.075 --> 00:59:18.278
Bosporus.
So this is very,

00:59:18.278 --> 00:59:22.745
very serious for Athens and
it's on this occasion that

00:59:22.745 --> 00:59:27.801
Demosthenes delivers his third
Philippic making the same case

00:59:27.801 --> 00:59:33.210
as he has been making all along,
and only doing so but I think

00:59:33.210 --> 00:59:37.158
with even greater intensity and
this time with more

00:59:37.158 --> 00:59:41.417
persuasiveness,
because more and more Athenians

00:59:41.417 --> 00:59:45.719
understand how serious this
menace has become.

00:59:45.719 --> 00:59:50.336
Small point but not so
trivial that the Athenians were

00:59:50.336 --> 00:59:55.599
able even to enlist the support
in language at least by Persia.

00:59:55.599 --> 00:59:58.295
If the Greeks are going to
fight this guy,

00:59:58.295 --> 01:00:01.780
it would be awfully handy if
you could get the Persian

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:03.561
support.
As it turns out,

01:00:03.561 --> 01:00:07.030
the Persians don't do anything
of importance in resisting

01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:09.093
Philip,
but it shows you how

01:00:09.093 --> 01:00:13.639
Demosthenes and those Greeks who
agreed with him were attempting

01:00:13.639 --> 01:00:17.753
to put together as strong a
coalition as they could to try

01:00:17.753 --> 01:00:20.630
to stop him.
Forgive me.

01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:24.454
Don't pay too much attention to
what I'm saying but I'm

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:28.917
constantly being reminded of the
behavior of the European states

01:00:28.917 --> 01:00:31.679
just prior to the Second World
War,

01:00:31.679 --> 01:00:36.130
and in place of Persia I think
we would have to put the United

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:39.696
States of America,
which was out of the game and

01:00:39.696 --> 01:00:43.400
sort of constantly trying to
stay out of the game,

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.654
powerful isolation of sentiment
in this country,

01:00:46.654 --> 01:00:49.701
and people in Europe,
some people urging that

01:00:49.701 --> 01:00:53.855
everything be done to get the
United States into the game and

01:00:53.855 --> 01:00:57.758
others reluctant to do that.
It wouldn't have made any

01:00:57.758 --> 01:01:01.014
difference, nothing would have
gotten the Americans to take an

01:01:01.014 --> 01:01:03.309
active part against Hitler at
that time,

01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:07.464
and I suspect there was no
chance that anybody could have

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:11.990
convinced the Persians to do
anything at this point either.

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:19.057
But the Athenians do send a
force and it's a good size force

01:01:19.057 --> 01:01:23.018
and it does a very good job,
and they drive Philip back out

01:01:23.018 --> 01:01:25.880
of some of the places that he
has conquered,

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:29.619
which I think is interesting to
think about.

01:01:29.619 --> 01:01:33.452
It's not obvious that if the
Athenians had gotten their

01:01:33.452 --> 01:01:37.531
collation together earlier,
and if they had done the best

01:01:37.531 --> 01:01:41.713
they could, it's not obvious
that they couldn't have defeated

01:01:41.713 --> 01:01:43.967
Philip.
There's this terrible danger

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:47.250
that we will all become victims
of a fait accompli,

01:01:47.250 --> 01:01:50.491
what happened obviously had to
happen, it couldn't happen any

01:01:50.491 --> 01:01:53.489
other way.
No, I don't think that's right.

01:01:53.489 --> 01:01:56.759
We certainly don't live our
lives as though that's true,

01:01:56.759 --> 01:01:59.850
and we shouldn't allow
ourselves to imagine it's true

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:03.130
in retrospect.
The fact that the Athenians

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:07.195
could have such success against
Philip as they did at this

01:02:07.195 --> 01:02:11.829
moment is evidence that that was
by no means a hopeless cause.

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:17.699
Once again, a Sacred War breaks
out over Delphi.

01:02:17.699 --> 01:02:23.820
Again, the Amphictyonic League,
this time of course having as

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:29.839
its president Philip invite
Philip to lead the forces of the

01:02:29.839 --> 01:02:32.791
Sacred War.
The Sacred War has been

01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:36.624
declared against the town near
Delphi called Amphisa and that's

01:02:36.624 --> 01:02:39.530
the force that he's going to use
against it.

01:02:39.530 --> 01:02:44.253
Philip moves down from
Thessaly, arrives at a place not

01:02:44.253 --> 01:02:48.276
very far from Delphi called
Elatea on one side,

01:02:48.276 --> 01:02:51.599
and the other side at
Thermopylae.

01:02:51.599 --> 01:02:56.710
These are the roots to get down
into central Greece.

01:02:56.710 --> 01:03:00.572
Once you go through those
places you are right next to

01:03:00.572 --> 01:03:04.070
Boeotia, you are a couple of
days from Athens,

01:03:04.070 --> 01:03:07.604
you're right in the middle of a
position where you could do

01:03:07.604 --> 01:03:11.147
terrific harm.
When the Athenians received

01:03:11.147 --> 01:03:17.969
the news, there really is panic.
Demosthenes tells the story.

01:03:17.969 --> 01:03:23.792
Now, Demosthenes is a witness
who is excellent because he's a

01:03:23.792 --> 01:03:27.325
participant, contemporary,
that's great,

01:03:27.325 --> 01:03:30.648
but you've got to look at him
with a certain amount of

01:03:30.648 --> 01:03:33.219
skepticism because he's a
participant.

01:03:33.219 --> 01:03:36.145
He's a guy who held a certain
point of view,

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:40.029
he was very active in politics,
he has strong views on

01:03:40.029 --> 01:03:44.202
everything, his reputation
depends upon how you look upon

01:03:44.202 --> 01:03:46.924
what he did.
So, you must understand that

01:03:46.924 --> 01:03:49.960
when he tells us these things
he's telling it form his

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.168
perspective.
It's very much like Winston

01:03:53.168 --> 01:03:58.647
Churchill's histories of the two
world wars in which he played a

01:03:58.647 --> 01:04:02.426
very large part,
even in the first but certainly

01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:05.170
in the second,
and it's not that he lies,

01:04:05.170 --> 01:04:09.183
it's not that he deceives,
but when you read those stories

01:04:09.183 --> 01:04:12.838
you read them as Winston
Churchill sees them and you have

01:04:12.838 --> 01:04:15.936
to be alert to them.
There's a wonderful--about

01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:18.823
Churchill is a wonderful story,
apparently true,

01:04:18.823 --> 01:04:22.508
that when Churchill's book on
the First World War came out--I

01:04:22.508 --> 01:04:25.539
forget the title;
let's say it was called "The

01:04:25.539 --> 01:04:29.419
Great War," which it wasn't.
The former prime minister,

01:04:29.419 --> 01:04:32.957
Arthur Balfour,
who didn't like Churchill at

01:04:32.957 --> 01:04:37.268
all is supposed to have said,
"I see that Winston has

01:04:37.268 --> 01:04:41.576
published another book about
himself and called it The Great

01:04:41.576 --> 01:04:43.981
War."
The enemies of Demosthenes

01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:47.501
might say the same things about
what he says in some of his

01:04:47.501 --> 01:04:50.317
speeches.
But later on in his career when

01:04:50.317 --> 01:04:54.289
there was a big battle between
him and his chief opponent,

01:04:54.289 --> 01:05:00.483
Demosthenes' friends were
asking the assembly to vote him

01:05:00.483 --> 01:05:03.199
a crown.
It meant a crown of leaves,

01:05:03.199 --> 01:05:05.761
not of gold,
but the honor for things he had

01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:08.741
done for Athens and his
opponents thought that what

01:05:08.741 --> 01:05:12.316
should be done for Demosthenes
for what he had done to Athens

01:05:12.316 --> 01:05:14.760
is to throw him off the
Acropolis.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:19.210
So, there's a great debate that
we have both halves of.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:22.581
It's in that debate that he
recounts the things he has done

01:05:22.581 --> 01:05:25.255
for Athens, why they should be
grateful to him,

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:27.579
and this moment is one he
points to.

01:05:27.579 --> 01:05:33.237
He tells about the news came to
Athens that Philip was in

01:05:33.237 --> 01:05:37.638
Elatea, and he says,
we all gathered there first

01:05:37.638 --> 01:05:41.269
thing in the morning and the
place was full.

01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:44.186
If you remember that
passage I read to you from

01:05:44.186 --> 01:05:47.511
Aristophanes about how things
usually were in the Athenian

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:50.225
assembly,
where everybody came ambling in

01:05:50.225 --> 01:05:52.686
late, no problem,
nobody was in a hurry,

01:05:52.686 --> 01:05:55.719
no he says,
everybody was there.

01:05:55.719 --> 01:06:02.008
When the prytany for the
day, the president of the

01:06:02.008 --> 01:06:05.714
meeting said,
who wishes to speak,

01:06:05.714 --> 01:06:09.869
no one, no one raised their
hand.

01:06:09.869 --> 01:06:14.018
Then I got up and gave you guys
the good advice that followed

01:06:14.018 --> 01:06:18.100
and all that stuff.
But I think we can't doubt the

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.835
essential truth of the
situation, that there was just a

01:06:22.835 --> 01:06:26.429
terrible fear and no idea how to
cope.

01:06:26.429 --> 01:06:32.239
Demosthenes then suggested what
steps should be taken to resist.

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:35.110
One of them,
and he was able to do it now,

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:39.239
was to use the theoric
fund to supply the forces that

01:06:39.239 --> 01:06:42.253
were necessary.
Secondly, to do something that

01:06:42.253 --> 01:06:45.395
was quite an achievement from a
diplomatic point of view,

01:06:45.395 --> 01:06:47.360
to make an alliance with
Thebes.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:52.434
Ever since the late 370s
Athens had not been allied to

01:06:52.434 --> 01:06:57.509
Thebes, it had become alarmed
that Theban power had joined

01:06:57.509 --> 01:07:01.159
even with Sparta against the
Thebans,

01:07:01.159 --> 01:07:05.803
but here as we're into the very
late 340s, early 330s,

01:07:05.803 --> 01:07:10.534
he makes an alliance with
Thebes so that what is surely

01:07:10.534 --> 01:07:15.704
the strongest ground force on
the side of the Greeks against

01:07:15.704 --> 01:07:19.590
Philip will be there,
namely the Thebans,

01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:26.492
and the Boeotians in general.
Finally, in 338 the Battle of

01:07:26.492 --> 01:07:35.654
Chaeronea takes place in western
Boeotia and the result is a

01:07:35.654 --> 01:07:39.070
victory for Philip.

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:45.760
The battle itself was by no
means a walkover;

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.298
it was very close.
Our accounts of it make it

01:07:50.298 --> 01:07:54.179
clear that there was every
possibility, even then,

01:07:54.179 --> 01:07:56.630
even though the Spartans
weren't there,

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:59.789
even though Philip's forces
were at their peak.

01:07:59.789 --> 01:08:03.667
The Greeks might have won that
battle, that's a very important

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:06.019
thing to remember,
but they didn't.

01:08:06.019 --> 01:08:09.989
Philip won and that was the end
of Greek freedom.

01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:14.925
Thereafter, the states all had
to bow down to Philip in terms

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:17.845
of foreign policy.
In many cases,

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:21.460
he actually interfered in their
internal autonomy.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:26.168
He established garrisons at key
places in the Greek world,

01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:31.042
including Chalcis and Euboea,
Corinth and Mount Ambracia in

01:08:31.042 --> 01:08:35.270
the west and they were called
the fetters of Greece.

01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:38.707
It was like he put a great
chain across Greece to show and

01:08:38.707 --> 01:08:41.180
demonstrate, and make real his
control.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:44.986
Athens was forced to abandon
the confederacy,

01:08:44.986 --> 01:08:48.361
its own confederacy;
they were forced to make an

01:08:48.361 --> 01:08:52.145
alliance with Philip.
He constituted in 336 the

01:08:52.145 --> 01:08:56.800
League of Corinth with himself
as president.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:01.310
It was an offensive and
defensive alliance.

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:06.183
Philip was commander in chief
and he could tell everybody what

01:09:06.183 --> 01:09:09.220
to do, and they would have to do
it.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:12.710
This truly was the end of Greek
freedom.

01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:16.645
As it turned out,
Philip was assassinated in the

01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:21.835
same year so that he never was
able to demonstrate how he would

01:09:21.835 --> 01:09:26.564
carry on once he had that power.
The business of the

01:09:26.564 --> 01:09:29.917
conquest of Persia,
if that was in the mind of

01:09:29.917 --> 01:09:34.239
Philip, had to be left to his
very young son Alexander,

01:09:34.239 --> 01:09:37.000
who I think was eighteen at
this point.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.284
So, that gets us to the
interesting question of

01:09:41.284 --> 01:09:44.729
history's judgment on these
events,

01:09:44.729 --> 01:09:48.685
and especially I think the
interesting person is

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:53.649
Demosthenes, and as you read in
your problems collection,

01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:59.323
the nineteenth-century German
historian Droysen and the German

01:09:59.323 --> 01:10:04.530
historians of that time in
general had no doubt about the

01:10:04.530 --> 01:10:07.926
judgment.
It was very negative about

01:10:07.926 --> 01:10:11.658
Demosthenes.
After all, what was Athens

01:10:11.658 --> 01:10:14.701
anyway?
According to Droysen it was

01:10:14.701 --> 01:10:19.494
ein advokaten republic,
it's the lowest blow anybody

01:10:19.494 --> 01:10:22.800
could deliver,
a republic of lawyers.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:29.321
What Demosthenes was trying to
preserve was kliene

01:10:29.321 --> 01:10:35.090
Städte,
the world of small independent

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:38.657
states,
a contemptible term in the eyes

01:10:38.657 --> 01:10:41.479
of Droysen and his fellow
nationalists.

01:10:41.479 --> 01:10:45.425
German, you remember had
just--I forget the date of his

01:10:45.425 --> 01:10:49.590
writing, either it had already
been unified by Bismarck or

01:10:49.590 --> 01:10:53.827
nationalists were demanding that
these little states all be

01:10:53.827 --> 01:10:58.138
brought together into a great
German empire and that's where

01:10:58.138 --> 01:11:01.054
Droysen was.
The future,

01:11:01.054 --> 01:11:04.060
Droysen said,
was with Philip.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:07.825
Demosthenes was a reactionary
trying to retain things that

01:11:07.825 --> 01:11:10.270
were--whose time had come and
gone.

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:13.319
What was needed was the
unification of the ancient

01:11:13.319 --> 01:11:16.680
Mediterranean and this was a
step in that direction.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.736
Why was it necessary to have a
unification of the ancient

01:11:19.736 --> 01:11:21.851
Mediterranean?
As would finally be

01:11:21.851 --> 01:11:24.398
accomplished,
not by Philip and Macedon,

01:11:24.398 --> 01:11:27.996
but by the Romans,
because it was all part of the

01:11:27.996 --> 01:11:31.632
great plan without which there
could not have been

01:11:31.632 --> 01:11:35.274
Christianity.
Christianity could come to the

01:11:35.274 --> 01:11:39.937
world and dominate Europe,
because it had been made into a

01:11:39.937 --> 01:11:45.010
single word by virtue of the
Macedonian and Roman conquest,

01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:49.417
and Demosthenes in his small
minded petty way was standing in

01:11:49.417 --> 01:11:53.527
the way of that.
Yes, there were admirable

01:11:53.527 --> 01:11:58.909
things about Demosthenes,
but his behavior and his policy

01:11:58.909 --> 01:12:02.850
was quixotic,
because it was hopeless.

01:12:02.850 --> 01:12:08.180
I think this is my reading of
what Droysen really is saying;

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.100
he lost so he must have been
wrong.

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:14.720
Winners are always right or
else they wouldn't win.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:19.560
Now, I think we can evaluate
that in a different way.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:22.270
If we think about a different
situation, I've been thinking

01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:24.420
about it all along and telling
you about it,

01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:28.528
which is let's take a look at
Winston Churchill who had been

01:12:28.528 --> 01:12:32.149
called by historians the
Demosthenes of that time.

01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:36.521
The man who had been calling
attention to the danger from

01:12:36.521 --> 01:12:40.971
Hitler and trying to rally
support and really treated like

01:12:40.971 --> 01:12:43.859
an idiot until finally the
knife,

01:12:43.859 --> 01:12:47.959
the dagger was at the throat of
the British and only then,

01:12:47.959 --> 01:12:52.489
and with great reluctance did
the British put him in control.

01:12:52.489 --> 01:12:55.628
Now, if we look at his
experience and what he did I

01:12:55.628 --> 01:12:59.762
think it's illuminating.
The difference between heroic

01:12:59.762 --> 01:13:03.649
victory and disaster can be
terribly thin.

01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:09.108
Taking office at a low point in
the fortunes of his country and

01:13:09.108 --> 01:13:13.069
its allies, Churchill made a
famous speech,

01:13:13.069 --> 01:13:17.198
which just breathed defiance
when there was no physical

01:13:17.198 --> 01:13:19.949
justification for such a
position.

01:13:19.949 --> 01:13:24.026
He said this,
"I have myself full confidence

01:13:24.026 --> 01:13:29.050
that if all do their duty,
if nothing is neglected,

01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:33.970
and if the best arrangements
are made as they are being made,

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:38.891
we shall prove ourselves once
again able to defend our island

01:13:38.891 --> 01:13:42.457
home.
To ride out the storm of war

01:13:42.457 --> 01:13:48.720
and to outlive the menace of
tyranny, if necessary for years,

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.664
if necessary alone,
we shall go onto the end,

01:13:52.664 --> 01:13:57.595
we shall fight in France,
we shall fight on the seas and

01:13:57.595 --> 01:14:00.932
the oceans,
we shall fight with growing

01:14:00.932 --> 01:14:05.506
confidence and growing strength
in the air, and we shall defend

01:14:05.506 --> 01:14:09.010
our island,
whatever the cost may be.

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:12.490
We shall fight on the beaches,
we shall fight on the landing

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:14.850
grounds, we shall fight in the
fields,

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:18.971
and in the streets,
and we shall fight in the

01:14:18.971 --> 01:14:22.250
hills, we shall never
surrender."

01:14:22.250 --> 01:14:28.497
Yet England came within a
hair's breath of losing that war

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:34.540
and suffering the horrors of
invasion and occupation by Nazi

01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:37.980
Germany.
In fact, had Hitler and Guering

01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:41.689
continued bombing the RAF's
landing fields and ground

01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:46.039
facilities as they began to do
with the Battle of Britain,

01:14:46.039 --> 01:14:50.013
instead of turning away from
that and using their planes to

01:14:50.013 --> 01:14:52.479
bomb cities and scaring
civilians,

01:14:52.479 --> 01:14:56.174
it's very clear to me that
Germany would have won the

01:14:56.174 --> 01:14:59.229
Battle of Britain and control of
the air,

01:14:59.229 --> 01:15:02.869
which would have made their
success inevitable.

01:15:02.869 --> 01:15:05.510
Now imagine that it had gone
that way;

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:08.122
in that case,
Churchill's bulldog

01:15:08.122 --> 01:15:11.715
determination,
his refusal to accept what was

01:15:11.715 --> 01:15:16.859
a relatively generous peace
offer after the fall of France,

01:15:16.859 --> 01:15:21.945
would seem in retrospect the
wrong-headed defiance of a man,

01:15:21.945 --> 01:15:26.600
who brought his people low by
his own intransigence.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.384
He would have been treated,
I think by history,

01:15:30.384 --> 01:15:35.649
as some kind of a gallant fool,
some kind of a brave imbecile.

01:15:35.649 --> 01:15:41.457
But men like Churchill and
Demosthenes know that those who

01:15:41.457 --> 01:15:46.523
love liberty must fight for it,
even against odds,

01:15:46.523 --> 01:15:52.614
even when there is little
support, even when victory seems

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:56.334
impossible.
In spite of the outcome,

01:15:56.334 --> 01:16:01.801
it seems to me that the stand
of Athens and its Greek allies

01:16:01.801 --> 01:16:07.083
at Chaeronea may have been in
words that Churchill used in

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:10.200
another context,
"their finest hour."

01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.666
Thank you very much.

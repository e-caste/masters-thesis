00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:07.223
Prof: All right we have
here forth flown at a relatively

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:12.620
high altitude with the likes of
Adam Smith, Carl Marx,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.370
Joseph Schumpeter,
F.A.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.386
Hayek, and today and continuing
from here to the mid-term,

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:24.170
we're going to deal with real
businesses.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:32.592
And it is our considerable
privilege to have with us Sharon

00:00:32.592 --> 00:00:36.463
Oster,
who is a Harvard PhD in

00:00:36.463 --> 00:00:42.594
Economics, is widely thought to
be the wisest owl on the

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:48.502
management of non-profit
organizations anywhere in the

00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:51.890
world,
and is the Frederick Wolf

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.810
Professor of Entrepreneurship at
the School of Management,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.259
and is, in addition to that,
a dean of that school.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:10.090
So please help me welcome
Sharon Oster.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.280
Sharon Oster:
 Thank you all.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.155
In my youth I taught at Yale
College and I taught generations

00:01:16.155 --> 00:01:18.480
of undergrads intermediate
micro,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.810
so it's nice to be back amongst
you,

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.680
teaching something a little bit
about economics.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.250
I hope Doug warned you,
but I'm going to treat it like

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.333
a business school class,
which means I'm going to cold

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:32.516
call on you,
and people in the back should

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:35.031
know that I especially like
calling on the people in the

00:01:35.031 --> 00:01:37.090
back because they tend to doze
otherwise,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.959
so you might want to change
your seat.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.390
So let's think about this case
a little bit.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.167
So imagine yourself,
you're one of the three

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.879
entrepreneurs Ferrari,
Gold, and Dillon.

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.890
The world is your oyster in
some sense.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.629
Here you are,
you've founded this firm,

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:59.449
you've got a product that's
this kit that can be used in

00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:02.659
heart surgery,
big market, there's a million

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.427
people who need heart disease--
who need some kind of heart

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:08.613
surgery every year;
growing market,

00:02:08.613 --> 00:02:11.457
we're all getting fatter,
we're getting older,

00:02:11.457 --> 00:02:13.782
we're getting weaker,
we're getting less healthy,

00:02:13.782 --> 00:02:16.295
you might think that's a
problem for President Obama and

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:18.351
the healthcare but it's an
opportunity for our

00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:19.220
entrepreneurs.
 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.479
This is a--even in the U.S.
 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:26.169
they could imagine a billion
dollar market in this business,

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:27.658
not to mention the rest of the
world,

00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:30.772
where people are also
overeating and getting less and

00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:32.270
less healthy over time.
 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.163
Yet when the case opens,
they seem like they have some

00:02:37.163 --> 00:02:39.378
worries on their mind.
 

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:43.538
So if you were one of those
individuals, guys in this case,

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:45.690
what are you thinking about?
 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.990
Student:  Marketing.
 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.244
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, so what do you mean

00:02:50.244 --> 00:02:50.979
by marketing?
 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.538
What's the issue?
 

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:56.413
Student: Well,
the issue is you have this

00:02:56.413 --> 00:02:58.926
product,
which could potentially be made

00:02:58.926 --> 00:03:01.258
into a lot of money and help out
consumers,

00:03:01.258 --> 00:03:02.590
but you have to work through
physicians,

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.750
since they're the ones who were
actually using this device,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.188
and for them to use the device,
they need training.

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:11.379
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, so one set of

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.722
questions we're going to have
are a set of questions about the

00:03:14.722 --> 00:03:15.270
buyer.
 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.994
There are going to be a lot of
questions about the buyer but

00:03:17.994 --> 00:03:20.858
let's just get that up there as
one set of things we're worried

00:03:20.858 --> 00:03:21.319
about.
 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.639
What are you worried about?
 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.586
Student:  I guess I'd be
worried about the

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:29.393
competitiveness of my product to
make sure that it can actually

00:03:29.393 --> 00:03:30.990
compete on the market.
 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.740
Sharon Oster:  Good.
 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.000
So you know at the moment--let
her have it,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.015
she's doing okay--so at the
moment I only have one

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:42.741
competitor,
so what would we call that if

00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:43.990
we were in economics class?
 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.690
Student:  A duopoly.
 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.680
Sharon Oster:
 A duopoly okay.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.914
Now one of the things we know
about duopolies,

00:03:48.914 --> 00:03:52.044
if they're any kind of sensible
duopolies they're probably doing

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:52.840
pretty well.
 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.842
This duopolist,
my competitor,

00:03:54.842 --> 00:03:57.259
what's his price point look
like?

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:59.128
Student:  Price point?
 

00:03:59.128 --> 00:04:01.223
Sharon Oster:
 Yeah so he--I'm charging

00:04:01.223 --> 00:04:03.180
$1,000 for my thing,
what's he charging?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.430
Anybody remember the number?
 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.330
Student:  $5,000.
 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.627
Sharon Oster:
 $5,000--they're good they

00:04:06.627 --> 00:04:07.135
know the numbers..
 

00:04:07.135 --> 00:04:08.348
Prof: I told you they
were good.

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:10.318
Sharon Oster:
 So I'm thinking to myself

00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:12.030
you're worried about the
competition,

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.097
but I got one competitor and
he's charging five times my

00:04:15.097 --> 00:04:17.827
price,
that makes me look like I'm

00:04:17.827 --> 00:04:18.899
pretty good.
 

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.209
Is there something else you're
worried about?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.636
Student:  Well it's not
just that one competitor,

00:04:24.636 --> 00:04:26.629
but its other techniques also.
 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:27.550
Sharon Oster:  Good.
 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.055
Okay, so one thing I'm worried
about right now is my existing

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:36.149
competitor,
but Schumpeter doesn't tell me

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:39.410
that I should only worry about a
static competition,

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.250
does he?
 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.254
What is Schumpeter's model
about what's happening with

00:04:43.254 --> 00:04:44.050
competition?
 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.639
Student:  Creative
destruction to the other firms

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.555
that went to market and less
successful firms were forced out

00:04:51.555 --> 00:04:52.730
of the market.
 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.192
Sharon Oster:
 So a thing that I have to

00:04:55.192 --> 00:04:58.459
worry about is not just the
extant competitor's Heartport,

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:01.709
but I better think a little bit
about who else is coming,

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:06.093
so I'm going to be thinking a
little bit about what Michael

00:05:06.093 --> 00:05:08.673
Porter,
who you also looked at I guess,

00:05:08.673 --> 00:05:11.500
is new entry and how do I
understand new entry?

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.997
Then if I think about the flip
side of Schumpeter not only am I

00:05:15.997 --> 00:05:20.278
worried about some new guys
coming in and destroying me,

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:25.021
but as I come in I'm of course
competing against some existing

00:05:25.021 --> 00:05:25.800
players.
 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.084
I need to think a little bit
existing players and the way in

00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:36.240
which they are attacking this
market.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.622
One of the things you're going
to observe about almost every

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:41.860
new product as it enters the
market,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.803
even if it thinks of itself as
a new product it has existing

00:05:45.803 --> 00:05:46.740
competitors.
 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.836
Many of you may have Kindles,
if you look at Kindles the

00:05:49.836 --> 00:05:53.384
Kindle is obviously also worried
about what's happening with the

00:05:53.384 --> 00:05:56.990
Sony Reader and all the new
things that look like a Kindle,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.000
but really from the point of
Kindle's--

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.865
from Kindle's point of view its
real job at the moment is

00:06:01.865 --> 00:06:05.139
converting all those people who
are buying hard covered books.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.726
It is thinking a little bit
about conversion of consumers

00:06:09.726 --> 00:06:14.394
from the way in which they are
currently used to solving a

00:06:14.394 --> 00:06:18.490
problem to your new way of
solving a problem,

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.634
so we're going to have to think
here in competition not only

00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:23.980
about the guys that are doing it
our way,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.259
but the existing players.
 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.714
And we're going to have to
think about these things in the

00:06:28.714 --> 00:06:31.990
context of a set of issues
involving the customers,

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.750
how I connect to the customers,
how I deliver to whoever these

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.766
customers are,
and we'll have to think about

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:41.461
that,
and a set of different products

00:06:41.461 --> 00:06:44.699
for the needs of our people.
 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.968
I'm going to stay with those
two things for awhile and then

00:06:48.968 --> 00:06:53.235
Doug will help me pull down the
slides to get to some other

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:56.076
questions in the end,
but this is going to take care

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:56.879
of us for a little while.
 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.709
Let's stick with the
competition part of it first.

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:03.773
Before I came along,
kind of how is it that people

00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:06.509
got their heart problem solved?
 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.278
Guy in the back with the pink
shirt in the last row.

00:07:08.278 --> 00:07:14.146
Student:  Either bypass
surgery or the balloon

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:15.500
procedure.
 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.541
Sharon Oster:
Good and do you have a

00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:19.778
vague idea about of these one
million patients,

00:07:19.778 --> 00:07:21.189
about how they divide up?
 

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:24.069
Student:  I don't know.
 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:25.363
Sharon Oster:
 Anybody else remember

00:07:25.363 --> 00:07:25.980
about the numbers?
 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:32.747
They're not perfect;
so the CABG is about 350,000

00:07:32.747 --> 00:07:36.363
and the angioplasty--
Prof: There is some

00:07:36.363 --> 00:07:38.079
hands up; we got to get them to
where she can see.

00:07:38.079 --> 00:07:39.387
Sharon Oster:
 Oh, if it's a number like

00:07:39.387 --> 00:07:40.100
that you can just yell.
 

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.720
You don't even have to raise
your hand.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.040
We're a much more casual group
than that in business school.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.440
I've got two different ways of
doing it;

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.470
let's stick with you,
do you got the mic handy?

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.410
Good.
 

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:54.161
Tell me a little bit about my
organization,

00:07:54.161 --> 00:07:58.182
CardioThoracics,
competing against competitors

00:07:58.182 --> 00:08:01.129
in each of those two markets.
 

00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:04.870
Student:  In the first
model of cardiothoracic systems,

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.776
it only allowed doctors to do
surgery on one or two blood

00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:13.196
vessels,
which would have replaced,

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:16.341
I believe,
the market for the balloon

00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:18.319
procedure,
angioplasty.

00:08:18.319 --> 00:08:23.389
Whereas, for the bypass
surgery, it was usually,

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:26.233
in that case,
because they were creating more

00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:28.415
trauma,
they would usually try to

00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:30.689
address as many vessels as
possible.

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:32.467
Sharon Oster:
 Okay so one of the things

00:08:32.467 --> 00:08:34.904
about this particular product is
in its infancy it could only do

00:08:34.904 --> 00:08:39.025
one or two vessels at a time,
and that limited it really

00:08:39.025 --> 00:08:43.558
pretty much to this side of the
picture,

00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:46.139
because most of what we were
doing--

00:08:46.139 --> 00:08:49.259
this side of the picture
involved, as you indicated,

00:08:49.259 --> 00:08:53.100
a little more drastic cutting,
and typically then more

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.418
treatment of multiple vessels.
 

00:08:55.418 --> 00:09:02.788
Generation 1 sort of focused on
this part of the market.

00:09:02.788 --> 00:09:07.356
Now, as you indicated,
the technological trajectory

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:11.707
was to more and more vessels,
so we're going to spend a

00:09:11.707 --> 00:09:14.908
little bit of money if we're
this firm and we're going to

00:09:14.908 --> 00:09:18.109
move to not only solving those
problems but solving those

00:09:18.109 --> 00:09:18.908
problems.
 

00:09:18.908 --> 00:09:21.629
Does that change come without a
cost?

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:24.924
As I move from Generation 1 to
Generation 2,

00:09:24.924 --> 00:09:28.297
to Generation 3,
I get more and more vessels,

00:09:28.297 --> 00:09:30.058
do I lose anything?
 

00:09:30.058 --> 00:09:32.779
Student:  You have to
pay for--

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:35.707
you have to invest in the
product, you have to train and

00:09:35.707 --> 00:09:38.277
retrain doctors,
you have to market it over and

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:38.899
over again.
 

00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:41.087
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, so one set of

00:09:41.087 --> 00:09:43.714
questions is as I'm doing
anything technological,

00:09:43.714 --> 00:09:46.450
I'm going to have to invest
real cash in this.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.366
I'm going to have to think a
little bit about that,

00:09:48.366 --> 00:09:50.322
but is there anything else I
lose as I move from one

00:09:50.322 --> 00:09:51.320
generation to another?
 

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.950
Yeah.
 

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.173
Student:  Well it's
harder because the whole point

00:09:57.173 --> 00:09:59.240
is to have a beating heart so it
could be longer,

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.690
so it's two different
&gt;

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.070
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, well that's true.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.216
It's harder to do more vessels
because I've got more things I'm

00:10:05.216 --> 00:10:08.427
trying to do as its beating,
but there's something else I'm

00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:10.720
doing as I move from Generation
1 onward.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.558
Yeah.
 

00:10:12.558 --> 00:10:16.710
Student: 
&gt;

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.682
Sharon Oster:
 Great, so if you think

00:10:18.682 --> 00:10:21.160
about this product in the
beginning, it had two kind of

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.399
technological features.
 

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.470
One was it dealt with the
bleeding heart--

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.948
beating heart,
not bleeding heart--and the

00:10:27.948 --> 00:10:32.321
second one it had a smaller cut,
so you didn't want to cut all

00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:34.565
the way through people,
you actually wanted to have a

00:10:34.565 --> 00:10:36.923
little bitty hole,
so small incision,

00:10:36.923 --> 00:10:42.220
and it turned out that the
beating heart eliminated some of

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.480
the neurological problems,
and the small incision made

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.509
people recover a little bit
faster.

00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:51.678
So they were different elements
of the product that we liked.

00:10:51.678 --> 00:10:57.106
When we moved from the kind of
only a couple vessels to many

00:10:57.106 --> 00:10:59.880
vessels,
we're giving up on some of the

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.052
functionality associated with
the product by cutting up

00:11:03.052 --> 00:11:06.399
patients a little bit more and
that's another feature that

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.100
Schumpeter and others have
talked about,

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.802
including Clay Christensen,
who talks about disruptive

00:11:12.802 --> 00:11:17.065
innovation that when you make a
product change it is often the

00:11:17.065 --> 00:11:19.720
case that you don't just
improve,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.159
improve, improve, improve.
 

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:23.273
You give up things;
there are tradeoffs that you're

00:11:23.273 --> 00:11:23.519
making.
 

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:26.052
And the tradeoffs are not just
to cost you more money and you

00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:29.101
get more functionality,
but sometimes you actually push

00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:33.070
along one dimension and you're
drawing back actually in what--

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:34.740
in the qualities of another
dimension.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:40.768
In this situation why put the
money in and give up the small

00:11:40.768 --> 00:11:47.000
incision piece just to enable
yourself to move into this piece

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.840
of the market?
 

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:53.043
After all the one or two
vessels market is the biggest

00:11:53.043 --> 00:11:56.850
chunk of the market and it's
pretty darn big,

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.316
I'm just a little guy,
why don't I manage as I am

00:12:00.316 --> 00:12:03.058
focusing on that part of the
market?

00:12:03.058 --> 00:12:08.070
Why is it I have to go--why is
it I decide to transform myself?

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.139
Here in the back,
the woman in the corner?

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:17.356
Student:  Because you
have

00:12:17.356 --> 00:12:24.350
to--&gt;
 

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.683
Sharon Oster:
 You have to say that

00:12:26.683 --> 00:12:29.645
louder for me or slower,
so I got a piece of it but I

00:12:29.645 --> 00:12:31.808
didn't get it all,
so start again.

00:12:31.808 --> 00:12:34.221
Student:  You need to
think about the preferences of

00:12:34.221 --> 00:12:36.311
your consumers,
the doctor that are going to be

00:12:36.311 --> 00:12:39.034
adopting your technology,
you need a larger incision so

00:12:39.034 --> 00:12:41.610
they can see the heart that
they're working on.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.163
And so it's not just about
moving from a couple vessels to

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:46.360
many, it's about catering to
their preferences.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.508
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, so one of the things

00:12:48.508 --> 00:12:51.067
I'm going to be thinking about
here as I'm thinking about

00:12:51.067 --> 00:12:53.168
technologically what to do to my
product,

00:12:53.168 --> 00:12:57.269
is that when I change what I
can do technologically,

00:12:57.269 --> 00:13:01.221
I am picking a different set of
markets that I'm trying to

00:13:01.221 --> 00:13:02.470
compete against.
 

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:07.272
And these markets are going to
look very different in terms of

00:13:07.272 --> 00:13:11.129
the kind of buyer issues and the
complimentor,

00:13:11.129 --> 00:13:13.330
and we'll talk about what I
mean by that in a minute,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.928
for each of these two parts of
the market.

00:13:15.928 --> 00:13:19.986
I am choosing my competition in
some sense by choosing my

00:13:19.986 --> 00:13:20.928
technology.
 

00:13:20.928 --> 00:13:27.150
I'm choosing to go against here
a set of--who's doing these CABG

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.038
things?
 

00:13:28.038 --> 00:13:31.373
These are surgeons,
so these are surgeons,

00:13:31.373 --> 00:13:33.649
they're cutting people up.
 

00:13:33.649 --> 00:13:35.990
Who's doing the angioplasty?
 

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:37.929
What looks different about that?
 

00:13:37.929 --> 00:13:39.058
Student:  Cardiologists.
 

00:13:39.058 --> 00:13:40.370
Sharon Oster:
 These are cardiologists;

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.360
they're being done in a
different kind of an office,

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:45.490
much less invasive procedure,
very different features

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.379
associated with these two parts
of the market.

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:50.143
And my ability,
given what I am,

00:13:50.143 --> 00:13:53.840
to compete in each of these two
markets is going to vary much,

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.086
so the technological trajectory
is influenced by the economics

00:13:58.086 --> 00:14:00.940
and the competitive piece of the
story.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.442
That you are not just imagining
yourself, a bunch of scientists

00:14:04.442 --> 00:14:07.096
in a lab, just trying to make it
better, better,

00:14:07.096 --> 00:14:08.168
better, better.
 

00:14:08.168 --> 00:14:11.389
You've got a set of managers on
top who are saying,

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:14.066
"You know what,
we need to have an improvement

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:16.284
on this dimension,
because otherwise we're never

00:14:16.284 --> 00:14:18.100
going to be anyplace in this
marketplace."

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.601
A decision was made,
and we're going to turn to

00:14:20.601 --> 00:14:22.940
figuring out why this decision
was made,

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:28.245
that it was going to be
important to be in this part of

00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:34.140
the market and not just this
part of the market to get myself

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:38.759
some more functionality with
multi vessels.

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:42.177
Okay, so to think about why I
needed to go that way I want to

00:14:42.177 --> 00:14:44.570
switch over a little bit to this
piece--

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.820
we're going to come back to
this part in a minute as well.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:53.370
I want to think a little bit
about the buyer issues.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:58.277
The woman in the back said if I
want to do something about

00:14:58.277 --> 00:15:02.495
knowing my technology,
I've got to figure out what

00:15:02.495 --> 00:15:04.820
does the consumer want.
 

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.610
Is that the relevant decision
maker in this case?

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:13.177
I'll put that here,
I've got a patient,

00:15:13.177 --> 00:15:19.330
and I'll call that patient the
consumer.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.740
When people go and they're
trying to have some heart

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.684
procedure do they just--
there's something the matter

00:15:25.684 --> 00:15:27.518
with your heart,
they just come up to you and

00:15:27.518 --> 00:15:29.451
say to you,
"How do you want me to do

00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:29.740
that?
 

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:33.303
How do you think--what
procedure do you think I should

00:15:33.303 --> 00:15:34.110
use?"
 

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.379
So who else is a decision maker
in this situation?

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:37.110
Yeah.
 

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:40.928
Student:  The doctor is
one of the major decision makers

00:15:40.928 --> 00:15:44.562
in this process because it's
talking about the whole concept

00:15:44.562 --> 00:15:48.134
of having the doctor needing to
be trained, and using their

00:15:48.134 --> 00:15:49.120
materials.
 

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.525
Sharon Oster:
 In fact,

00:15:50.525 --> 00:15:53.000
there are actually three
different doctors you might

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.940
think play a role in this
situation.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.620
The one you mentioned is a
surgeon.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.259
Student:  There's also
the referring doctors.

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:00.753
Sharon Oster:
 Good, so there's your

00:16:00.753 --> 00:16:02.139
basic GP or whatever it is you
have,

00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:04.471
some guy you go,
you put on--I've got a pain in

00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:07.202
my chest,
he says, "You better do

00:16:07.202 --> 00:16:10.692
something about that,"
and then there is a

00:16:10.692 --> 00:16:14.586
interventional cardiologist,
who does this piece of the

00:16:14.586 --> 00:16:15.149
business.
 

00:16:15.149 --> 00:16:19.000
You--some doctor says,
"Go see somebody,"

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.477
and typically he actually says,
"Go see this guy,"

00:16:23.477 --> 00:16:27.658
and this guy figures out can he
help you or can she help you,

00:16:27.658 --> 00:16:29.740
and if not they send you to a
surgeon.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.782
You've got interveners or
decision makers all along the

00:16:34.782 --> 00:16:36.370
doctor element.
 

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.908
Is there anybody else you think
that, if I'm the inventors of

00:16:39.908 --> 00:16:42.624
this little kit,
is there anyone else I need to

00:16:42.624 --> 00:16:44.629
talk too, need to think about?
 

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.767
Yeah.
 

00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:45.538
Student:  Insurance.
 

00:16:45.538 --> 00:16:46.980
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, insurance companies.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.634
So it turns out,
one of the curiosities about

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.837
healthcare,
and it's the one that's

00:16:51.837 --> 00:16:55.620
bedeviling the Obama team now in
terms of figuring things out,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:59.857
is we have this breakage of the
link between people who make

00:16:59.857 --> 00:17:03.808
decisions about things and the
people who pay for it.

00:17:03.808 --> 00:17:07.247
In this situation,
the patients have some stake in

00:17:07.247 --> 00:17:11.518
the procedure,
the doctors have a lot to say,

00:17:11.518 --> 00:17:15.108
but the poor insurance
companies,

00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:19.575
and/or the government are
actually doing a lot of the

00:17:19.575 --> 00:17:20.950
paying for it.
 

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.665
Needless to say in that kind of
arrangement, eventually the

00:17:24.665 --> 00:17:28.509
insurance company starts having
an opinion too and making its

00:17:28.509 --> 00:17:29.598
opinion felt.
 

00:17:29.598 --> 00:17:33.529
If you are in the business of
medical devices or pharma,

00:17:33.529 --> 00:17:35.895
in any way at all,
you're going to be thinking a

00:17:35.895 --> 00:17:38.565
little bit about how is the
insurance company going to

00:17:38.565 --> 00:17:40.529
reimburse for this kind of a
thing?

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:43.089
Is there anybody else that has
an opinion about this?

00:17:43.089 --> 00:17:44.220
Yeah.
 

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.230
Student:  Hospitals.
 

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.880
Sharon Oster: Hospitals.
 

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.538
Why do the hospitals care?
 

00:17:47.538 --> 00:17:51.057
Student:  I mean,
just from the insurance

00:17:51.057 --> 00:17:55.624
standpoint, and whether or not
they want these technologies to

00:17:55.624 --> 00:17:57.869
be used at their hospital.
 

00:17:57.869 --> 00:17:59.900
Sharon Oster:  So--good.
 

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.765
So hospitals actually turn out
to have an interesting set of

00:18:03.765 --> 00:18:06.190
issues about this particular
thing.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:11.153
Hospitals, to the extent that
they are reimbursed by

00:18:11.153 --> 00:18:14.749
insurance,
and that's going to be true for

00:18:14.749 --> 00:18:17.980
most of the patients in this
environment,

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.880
are reimbursed on what's known
as a capitated basis,

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.670
which means an insurance
company says to you,

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.432
"If you're treating
somebody who has a particular

00:18:28.432 --> 00:18:31.041
heart problem,
I'm going to give you a fixed

00:18:31.041 --> 00:18:32.288
amount for it."
 

00:18:32.288 --> 00:18:35.220
That's quite a difference from
the way we used to--

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.888
insurance used to pay,
which was, "You treated

00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:39.717
somebody,
let me see what your bills are,

00:18:39.717 --> 00:18:40.788
I'm going to pay you."
 

00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:44.943
In an attempt to get some kind
of efficiency they actually went

00:18:44.943 --> 00:18:47.556
to a system,
sometimes called DRGs,

00:18:47.556 --> 00:18:50.644
in which they said,
"For an average,

00:18:50.644 --> 00:18:54.200
more or less healthy guy who
has this problem,

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.670
I'm going to pay you X to treat
him."

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:01.304
If I'm going to pay--if that's
the way I have my hospital

00:19:01.304 --> 00:19:05.193
reimbursement happen,
how does the hospital feel

00:19:05.193 --> 00:19:07.759
about my particular device?
 

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:10.640
What do you think?
 

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:12.900
Student:  Not great,
probably.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.250
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, so one thing it

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.834
doesn't like is its just costing
them money, so it's kind of just

00:19:18.834 --> 00:19:20.288
taking it off the top.
 

00:19:20.288 --> 00:19:25.440
Might there be anything about
it they would like?

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.640
Yeah, in the back.
 

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.126
Student:  The device
improves patient recovery time

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:31.178
and reduces mortality,
because that's one of the

00:19:31.178 --> 00:19:32.880
things I wanted to try to
quantify.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.727
Sharon Oster:
 Yeah, and there could be

00:19:34.727 --> 00:19:37.150
other people who care about the
mortality in particular,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.798
but the first thing you said
was about recovery time.

00:19:40.798 --> 00:19:42.990
Why might the hospital be
especially interested in that?

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.538
Yeah.
 

00:19:43.538 --> 00:19:48.640
Student:  Well because I
know for most of the time it--

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.900
the procedure is capitated for
payment,

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.282
and a lot of times recovery
time is also going to fall under

00:19:53.282 --> 00:19:54.949
that payment,
and the longer you recover

00:19:54.949 --> 00:19:56.910
you're not going to get any more
money for that,

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.953
so if you have quicker
recoveries you're

00:19:58.953 --> 00:20:00.368
&gt;
 

00:20:00.368 --> 00:20:02.059
Sharon Oster:
 So it's actually going to

00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:04.191
vary for different hospitals
depending on the contract that

00:20:04.191 --> 00:20:05.108
they're going to get.
 

00:20:05.108 --> 00:20:08.608
So for some hospitals I just
give you a fee,

00:20:08.608 --> 00:20:11.855
and that would mean if I
get--if this procedure gets you

00:20:11.855 --> 00:20:14.098
out of your bed and to home
faster,

00:20:14.098 --> 00:20:16.861
that's a benefit for the
hospital because they basically

00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:18.819
only have to keep you in three
days,

00:20:18.819 --> 00:20:21.160
not seven, I save some money.
 

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.914
On the other hand,
what does this device do to the

00:20:24.914 --> 00:20:29.130
amount of time I need to use as
an operating surgeon?

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.660
Student: 
&gt;

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.230
Sharon Oster:
 Probably increases it.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.416
And from the point of view of
hospitals, most hospitals are

00:20:35.416 --> 00:20:38.440
more constrained in operating
room time than they are in

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.650
hospital bed time.
 

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.784
Again, it's going to depend a
little bit on the hospital how

00:20:42.784 --> 00:20:45.686
they feel about this,
and a little bit on how much

00:20:45.686 --> 00:20:48.358
we've pushed down in terms of
the insurance,

00:20:48.358 --> 00:20:51.150
but the hospital is definitely
going to have some kind of say.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:56.180
Now notice something about
these groups,

00:20:56.180 --> 00:21:00.577
they all have opinions,
they all have a role to play in

00:21:00.577 --> 00:21:05.140
the kind of decision that's
going to affect my ability to

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.480
compete in these parts of the
market.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:13.180
Do they all have the same kinds
of preferences?

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:14.640
Guy in the orange.
 

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.500
Student: 
&gt;

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.531
Sharon Oster:
 Talk to me a little bit

00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:24.766
about how each of these players,
or a couple of these players,

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:29.548
might feel about the idea of
introducing this kit that

00:21:29.548 --> 00:21:33.430
enables people to operate on
your heart.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.688
Student:  I mean it's
going to have a different

00:21:35.688 --> 00:21:37.348
response from each one of the
buyers.

00:21:37.348 --> 00:21:39.227
Potentially,
doctors can make more money off

00:21:39.227 --> 00:21:41.436
of it,
it's just if it's less

00:21:41.436 --> 00:21:44.660
technologically inclined for
example,

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.805
so I mean their previous
systems could have made them a

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.904
lot more money,
whereas patients could actually

00:21:48.904 --> 00:21:51.048
benefit if this system actually
lowered costs,

00:21:51.048 --> 00:21:53.916
so each one of the buyers is
going to have different

00:21:53.916 --> 00:21:55.380
responses towards costs.
 

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:56.727
Sharon Oster:
 Okay that's a little

00:21:56.727 --> 00:21:56.990
vague.
 

00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:58.390
Let's sharpen it up.
 

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.470
You can sharpen it up for us.
 

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.368
It's not wrong,
it's just a little vague.

00:22:05.368 --> 00:22:08.558
Student:  Okay so like
sharpening things up.

00:22:08.558 --> 00:22:10.490
In terms of the patient and
consumer,

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:14.503
I think what he was trying to
say, was that with these new

00:22:14.503 --> 00:22:18.587
technologies it'll require
greater training that the doctor

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:22.180
may or may not be able to afford
or go through.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.928
But it might also benefit a
patient because the technology

00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:29.150
would be less invasive,
or something like that.

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:32.578
But there's a higher risk
involved because there weren't

00:22:32.578 --> 00:22:35.790
as many testing's that--
as were mentioned before,

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.038
so that could offset the
patient preference of going

00:22:39.038 --> 00:22:42.539
under the knife of something
that isn't that tested.

00:22:42.539 --> 00:22:42.920
Sharon Oster:  Good.
 

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.500
Okay, so a couple of issues
here.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.696
One is there's certainly a
question about the doctor

00:22:47.696 --> 00:22:49.730
training,
and one of the things that's

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.202
going to keep me awake as an
entrepreneur is thinking a

00:22:52.202 --> 00:22:54.078
little bit about the doctor
training,

00:22:54.078 --> 00:22:56.338
which we are going to get to in
a couple of minutes.

00:22:56.338 --> 00:23:00.192
Certainly the doctors are going
to be right away at me and

00:23:00.192 --> 00:23:01.943
saying,
"Okay, how am I going to

00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:03.390
get to learn that kind of
thing?"

00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:06.432
You can already begin to see
it's not going to be the kind of

00:23:06.432 --> 00:23:09.118
thing I'm going to have a course
that I charge for.

00:23:09.118 --> 00:23:12.077
It is going to be--I'm going to
have to figure out some way to

00:23:12.077 --> 00:23:15.085
incentivize these guys to come
to my particular class and learn

00:23:15.085 --> 00:23:17.555
something about it,
and we'll talk about what that

00:23:17.555 --> 00:23:17.730
is.
 

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.430
The other thing I heard you say
was something about risk.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:26.174
Let's think about the risk
issues for the surgeon versus

00:23:26.174 --> 00:23:30.230
the patient and how they weight
those things.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:35.310
Now in theory if we're doing
surgery, what's the medical

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:38.730
benefit of this particular
product?

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.108
The guy in the red in the back.
 

00:23:43.108 --> 00:23:45.375
Student:  I think it
reduces the mortality rate of

00:23:45.375 --> 00:23:45.818
patients.
 

00:23:45.818 --> 00:23:47.371
Sharon Oster:
 Okay so one thing it may

00:23:47.371 --> 00:23:49.433
do is reduce mortality rate,
although it's a little bit

00:23:49.433 --> 00:23:52.020
tricky in the beginning,
because we don't know how good

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.558
the doctors are going to be.
 

00:23:53.558 --> 00:23:57.221
The initial real kind of
consumer sale piece of this,

00:23:57.221 --> 00:24:00.390
was less on the mortality and
more on what?

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:01.400
Yeah.
 

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.513
Student:  The recovery
rate is whatever they can get

00:24:04.513 --> 00:24:06.338
out of &gt;
 

00:24:06.338 --> 00:24:08.354
Sharon Oster:
 Okay so some of it is I

00:24:08.354 --> 00:24:09.818
can reduce your recovery rate.
 

00:24:09.818 --> 00:24:13.159
If we think about that,
does the doctor care a lot

00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:15.750
about how fast you get back to
work?

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.005
Student:  No,
that's the--well I mean--yes I

00:24:18.005 --> 00:24:19.720
guess that's when it's your
patient.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.903
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, so one of the things

00:24:21.903 --> 00:24:24.275
we might think about,
the recovery angle is that the

00:24:24.275 --> 00:24:26.598
patient is going to care more
than the doctor.

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:30.426
So that's going to be an
element, recovery time,

00:24:30.426 --> 00:24:35.476
in which we've got an asymmetry
in terms of how much the people

00:24:35.476 --> 00:24:37.349
value these things.
 

00:24:37.349 --> 00:24:39.119
What's another element?
 

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:39.789
Yeah.
 

00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:41.808
Student:  The trauma.
 

00:24:41.808 --> 00:24:42.660
Sharon Oster:
 The trauma.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.361
Student:  The sudden
neurological complications that

00:24:45.361 --> 00:24:46.480
develop after surgery.
 

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.960
Sharon Oster:
 Yeah, so another thing

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.363
about this surgery is you have
to be on a heart-lung machine

00:24:52.363 --> 00:24:54.785
and that actually has
neurological problems

00:24:54.785 --> 00:24:56.920
potentially associated with it.
 

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.595
So we've got something that's
actually potentially going to

00:25:00.595 --> 00:25:03.318
reduce some of our neurological
problems.

00:25:03.318 --> 00:25:06.949
It turns out for various
studies people have done who

00:25:06.949 --> 00:25:10.440
study doctors and medical care
kinds of things,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:15.117
if you thought about the
tradeoff to a patient and asked

00:25:15.117 --> 00:25:19.196
the question,
"How much incremental risk

00:25:19.196 --> 00:25:24.632
of death would you be willing to
face to avoid the kind of very

00:25:24.632 --> 00:25:27.348
serious neurological damage?
 

00:25:27.348 --> 00:25:31.030
The answer to that question is
very different for patients then

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.160
it is to doctors.
 

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:37.114
From the doctors point of view
the danger of having someone die

00:25:37.114 --> 00:25:41.670
on the table is enormous
relative to any other problem.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:44.915
From the patients point of view
there are times in which they

00:25:44.915 --> 00:25:49.007
are willing to tradeoff and say,
"There are some conditions

00:25:49.007 --> 00:25:52.415
that I could have that,
frankly, I would just as soon

00:25:52.415 --> 00:25:54.108
take a chance of dying."
 

00:25:54.108 --> 00:25:57.661
That's been actually a very
complicated set of issues for

00:25:57.661 --> 00:26:00.894
doctor/patient relationships
across a whole range of

00:26:00.894 --> 00:26:03.940
different operative and surgical
procedures.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.625
It says to me in this
situation, where we are talking

00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:10.460
about heart recovery kinds of
issues,

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.430
those tradeoffs are going to
become potentially very large.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:17.780
When we have a risk of death
that's going to be larger for

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:22.228
the doctor,
and the risk of damage is going

00:26:22.228 --> 00:26:28.548
to be conversely more important
from the patient's point of

00:26:28.548 --> 00:26:29.420
view.
 

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:34.544
Now let's think a little bit
about these different players

00:26:34.544 --> 00:26:38.500
and look at these two parts of
the market.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.770
Because we started this by
saying that these guys did a

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.345
whole bunch of technological
things to try to move into this

00:26:45.345 --> 00:26:49.133
part of the market,
as opposed to staying in this

00:26:49.133 --> 00:26:51.868
rather larger part of the
market.

00:26:51.868 --> 00:26:55.722
As we think about these being
the deciders among the things,

00:26:55.722 --> 00:26:59.250
why is it technologically
imperative to get out of this

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.339
market and into this market?
 

00:27:01.339 --> 00:27:02.170
Yeah.
 

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:08.366
Student:  Cardiologists
would be the ones who refer you

00:27:08.366 --> 00:27:10.726
to surgery,
and if they are the ones who

00:27:10.726 --> 00:27:12.816
perform the procedure,
they then benefit being able to

00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:14.269
perform the procedure
themselves,

00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:17.509
so they have a quasi-monopoly
over the market in some sense.

00:27:17.509 --> 00:27:19.545
Sharon Oster:
 So some people call this

00:27:19.545 --> 00:27:21.220
the "gatekeeper
problem."

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:25.468
It turns out in this particular
market I've got a gatekeeper

00:27:25.468 --> 00:27:27.983
problem,
which is my big competition,

00:27:27.983 --> 00:27:31.125
are the ones that are going to
basically handle this

00:27:31.125 --> 00:27:33.767
themselves,
and their tendency to then say,

00:27:33.767 --> 00:27:36.075
"You know,
you've got two vessels,

00:27:36.075 --> 00:27:39.103
I could deal with it,
but I think you'd be better off

00:27:39.103 --> 00:27:42.269
going here now that we have a
kit," is going to be much

00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.858
reduced.
 

00:27:42.858 --> 00:27:49.101
So I've got a problem that my
competitor is a gatekeeper for

00:27:49.101 --> 00:27:49.630
me.
 

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:54.598
There's another problem also in
this--attacking this part of the

00:27:54.598 --> 00:27:55.308
market.
 

00:27:55.308 --> 00:28:00.140
Let's think about it from the
point of view of the patient.

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:05.728
How does the patient,
who has just one or two vessels

00:28:05.728 --> 00:28:10.349
damaged, feel about these two
procedures?

00:28:10.349 --> 00:28:13.420
Yeah.
 

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:17.517
Student:  Angioplasty is
already quite non-intrusive,

00:28:17.517 --> 00:28:21.545
so there isn't a huge benefit
gained by trying to--the new,

00:28:21.545 --> 00:28:23.420
rather untested method.
 

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.906
Sharon Oster:
 If you think about what

00:28:25.906 --> 00:28:28.616
this is--
I actually did some work for

00:28:28.616 --> 00:28:33.088
Boston Scientific in this market
as an economist and they--

00:28:33.088 --> 00:28:36.486
even though I was only an
economist they actually wanted

00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:39.635
me to watch one of these
procedures for reasons that

00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:41.180
completely escape me.
 

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.484
If you watch one of these
things it's--the patient is

00:28:45.484 --> 00:28:47.390
awake the whole time.
 

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:49.420
There is--basically what they
do is,

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.038
there's a little blockage in
one of your arteries,

00:28:52.038 --> 00:28:55.019
they put a thing that looks
sort of this,

00:28:55.019 --> 00:28:57.830
but a little smaller up your
leg, they weave it up until it

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.450
gets to the right part in which
there's a blockage,

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.910
they have a balloon at the end
of it,

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:05.000
they have a little machine that
blows up the balloon,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.720
the balloon just presses
against the wall of the artery,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.492
all the junk that was clogging
it up goes whish and kind of

00:29:11.492 --> 00:29:15.574
floats away,
we hope to wherever nirvana is,

00:29:15.574 --> 00:29:19.778
and then they take it out and
off you go.

00:29:19.778 --> 00:29:23.653
It's very non-invasive,
that's very appealing to the

00:29:23.653 --> 00:29:28.210
consumer, I've got a gatekeeper
here who's a cardiologist.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.390
What would the insurance
company rather have me do?

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.538
Oh, this is way cheaper.
 

00:29:34.538 --> 00:29:38.272
These angioplasty things are
way cheaper than anything in the

00:29:38.272 --> 00:29:39.019
CABG side.
 

00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:41.750
So anyone that's an insurer is
going to be thinking,

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.338
"You've only got one or
two vessels,

00:29:45.338 --> 00:29:50.920
go this way rather than trying
to do a less problematic version

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.358
of this."
 

00:29:52.358 --> 00:29:57.954
From the point of view of
solving the needs of these

00:29:57.954 --> 00:30:03.660
people, I can't stay in this
part of the business.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.984
I don't have enough value add
to offer in that part of the

00:30:07.984 --> 00:30:08.818
business.
 

00:30:08.818 --> 00:30:11.992
I have got to go to the only
part of the business in which I

00:30:11.992 --> 00:30:14.625
have potential value add,
which is this part of it,

00:30:14.625 --> 00:30:17.452
and for that it says to me,
"Even though I'm going to

00:30:17.452 --> 00:30:20.044
give up something in
functionality I'm going to need

00:30:20.044 --> 00:30:23.193
to give that up in order to make
myself more attractive in that

00:30:23.193 --> 00:30:24.818
part of the business."
 

00:30:24.818 --> 00:30:28.570
Because from the point of view
of everything--pretty much

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.588
everything these guys care
about, this thing is dominated.

00:30:32.588 --> 00:30:38.980
Now--we'll come to the little
more on the competition in a

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.990
minute.
 

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:44.384
Let me backtrack slightly from
that aggressive comment I just

00:30:44.384 --> 00:30:46.465
made,
because there is one problem,

00:30:46.465 --> 00:30:48.480
for those of you that read
carefully,

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.202
there is one problem that the
angioplasty has that would be

00:30:53.202 --> 00:30:58.008
improved by me actually trying
to do this in a less invasive

00:30:58.008 --> 00:30:58.660
way.
 

00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.618
Yeah.
 

00:30:59.618 --> 00:31:02.845
Student:  Well one of
the problems is that the plaque

00:31:02.845 --> 00:31:06.180
often returns because the vessel
is trying to heal itself,

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.413
and it can be a bigger problem
and you don't have to do the

00:31:08.413 --> 00:31:09.068
procedure then.
 

00:31:09.068 --> 00:31:10.097
Sharon Oster:
 Great.

00:31:10.097 --> 00:31:12.038
So an issue that we have from
the point of view--

00:31:12.038 --> 00:31:15.670
an issue that this competitor
has is something medically,

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.808
it's called restenosis,
so that I could have this done,

00:31:19.808 --> 00:31:22.400
but I have to do it many times
and then you could think,

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.460
now what the patient is
thinking is,

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.630
"Do I want to have this
with the kit done once,

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:31.068
or do I want to have this done
every other year,

00:31:31.068 --> 00:31:34.338
which sounds a little less
appealing than it sounded a

00:31:34.338 --> 00:31:37.855
minute ago when I thought we
could just do it once and for

00:31:37.855 --> 00:31:38.720
all."
 

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.618
Initially you might think,
"Well it looks like there

00:31:42.618 --> 00:31:46.519
is some advantage I could build
on in my discussions with

00:31:46.519 --> 00:31:49.893
patients and doctors,
and frankly even insurers and

00:31:49.893 --> 00:31:52.351
hospitals,
that would make me an

00:31:52.351 --> 00:31:55.630
attractive alternative to
this."

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.548
But if I was thinking in a
Schumpeterian way and going to

00:31:59.548 --> 00:32:04.268
build my business around that,
what else would I want to be

00:32:04.268 --> 00:32:07.880
thinking about in terms of that
strategy?

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.858
So a strategy that says,
"Okay,

00:32:10.858 --> 00:32:15.099
I'm looking at what these guys
are like now and I'm thinking

00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:17.759
about how I look relative to
them,

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:20.588
and there is something they
don't do very well,

00:32:20.588 --> 00:32:24.164
and I'm going to just kind of
hammer in on what they don't do

00:32:24.164 --> 00:32:24.940
well."
 

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:28.210
What's the potential worry that
I might have about that?

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:32.078
Yeah.
 

00:32:32.078 --> 00:32:33.288
Student:  Well,
I think it's just the

00:32:33.288 --> 00:32:34.470
gatekeeper problem that you were
saying.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:38.521
All the people that do that not
that well are the people that

00:32:38.521 --> 00:32:42.305
are going to recommend your
patients to the surgeons that

00:32:42.305 --> 00:32:45.480
you are ultimately selling your
product to.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.420
So it's really not going to
work out very well.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.153
Sharon Oster:
 Okay good,

00:32:48.153 --> 00:32:49.160
so keep the mic.
 

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.472
So that tells me if I were
going to go that way,

00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:56.410
what would I need to be doing?
 

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:00.940
Student:  You have to
expand so that interventionist

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.828
cardiologists can use the
product,

00:33:03.828 --> 00:33:06.720
or eliminate the gatekeeper
problem in some way,

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.170
I guess.
 

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:08.678
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, so I've got to

00:33:08.678 --> 00:33:10.150
figure out a way to get over the
gate.

00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:15.079
What's a way to get over the
gate?

00:33:15.079 --> 00:33:16.920
Student:  I have no idea.
 

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.781
Student:  Talking to
patients so that--you can target

00:33:19.781 --> 00:33:22.111
the patients so that demand it
from their doctor,

00:33:22.111 --> 00:33:23.470
from their cardiologist.
 

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:24.192
Sharon Oster:
 Good.

00:33:24.192 --> 00:33:25.920
So we could think a little bit
about what's been happening--

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.788
those of you that watch
television,

00:33:27.788 --> 00:33:31.490
probably none of you
anymore--one of the things we've

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.834
seen in the healthcare area is
much more direct advertising to

00:33:35.834 --> 00:33:36.759
patients.
 

00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:39.298
Even for things that you would
think your doctor--

00:33:39.298 --> 00:33:42.306
these are things your doctor is
going to prescribe for you or

00:33:42.306 --> 00:33:44.160
make you do in one way or
another,

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.529
there is an attempt in a lot of
areas to avoid the gatekeeper by

00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:50.680
going direct to the patients.
 

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:55.071
How easy is that to do in this
market as opposed to a market

00:33:55.071 --> 00:33:56.710
like allergy relief?
 

00:33:56.710 --> 00:34:00.459
Okay, if there's--there are
markets now for Claritin or one

00:34:00.459 --> 00:34:02.980
of these drugs that is
prescription,

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.490
so the only way you can get it
is to go to your doctor,

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:08.670
but the line is,
"Go to your doctor and ask

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.650
them to prescribe this drug for
you."

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:14.304
Is it going to be easy for me
to have on television something

00:34:14.304 --> 00:34:16.327
that says,
"Go to your doctor and

00:34:16.327 --> 00:34:18.579
tell them you don't want an
angioplasty,

00:34:18.579 --> 00:34:23.360
you want your CABG done with
the beating heart kit?"

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.469
So why are you all laughing?
 

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.469
What's ridiculous about this?
 

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:29.119
Student:  It's
information asymmetry.

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:30.568
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, so (a) it's

00:34:30.568 --> 00:34:32.630
complicated, information
asymmetry is exactly right.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.699
You could think,
"Okay, I could go to my

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.960
doctor with that,
but what the hell do I know?

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.199
I mean, really,
I'm not going to trust my own

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.846
view of this even if the
television told me so,"

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:44.644
but there's actually another
just sort of business issue

00:34:44.644 --> 00:34:46.646
which is,
there, in some sense,

00:34:46.646 --> 00:34:49.811
aren't enough people watching
TV for whom that message is

00:34:49.811 --> 00:34:50.489
relevant.
 

00:34:50.489 --> 00:34:54.510
Even if I could really focus in
on TV and do it I'm going to

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.760
be--it's going to be a problem.
 

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.630
There are some possibilities
maybe on the way.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.443
You could imagine a set of web
advertisements that when you're

00:35:04.443 --> 00:35:08.009
clicking on something that says
what do I do about a heart

00:35:08.009 --> 00:35:08.760
problem?
 

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.675
It clicks up to me,
"Talk to your doctor about

00:35:11.675 --> 00:35:13.659
the beating Heartport kit."
 

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:17.155
So there are some technological
things directed at marketing

00:35:17.155 --> 00:35:20.532
that actually allow us in
various markets to get away from

00:35:20.532 --> 00:35:22.309
gatekeepers and go direct.
 

00:35:22.309 --> 00:35:26.360
There's actually another
problem with building a lot on

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.559
this strategy.
 

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:31.940
As I think about building a
strategy to attack an existing

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.860
player, any of you have game
theory?

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.110
Any of you ever take game
theory?

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.750
Did--any of you economics
majors?

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:44.521
Okay, good I'm picking on you
because you should know this as

00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:45.260
an econ major.
 

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.878
If you're thinking about
positioning yourself against an

00:35:49.878 --> 00:35:53.186
existing competitor,
I'm looking at what this guy is

00:35:53.186 --> 00:35:55.969
doing now,
what else should I be looking

00:35:55.969 --> 00:35:56.280
at?
 

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.840
Student:  How he's going
to react to my reaction.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.619
Sharon Oster:  Exactly.
 

00:35:59.619 --> 00:36:02.847
I need to be thinking this
guy--what is he going to be

00:36:02.847 --> 00:36:06.260
doing, sitting around,
kind of reaping in the profits?

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:11.032
He's going to be thinking about
here you came with this new

00:36:11.032 --> 00:36:16.050
business, and you're attacking
me--by virtue of my restenosis,

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.190
what am I going to do?
 

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:21.815
Now I want to think a little
bit about, if I'm the designer

00:36:21.815 --> 00:36:24.440
of this thing,
is who are these players?

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.317
Anyone have any sense of who
the guys are doing the

00:36:28.317 --> 00:36:31.728
angioplasty business,
producing these balloon

00:36:31.728 --> 00:36:33.590
catheters and so on?
 

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:36.284
Well they're big companies,
companies like some of you may

00:36:36.284 --> 00:36:39.097
want to work for some day;
Boston Scientific,

00:36:39.097 --> 00:36:41.909
Medtronic, Johnson &amp;
Johnson.

00:36:41.909 --> 00:36:44.750
What's true about these big
companies?

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.887
They spend a lot of money on
R&amp;D because they make a lot

00:36:48.887 --> 00:36:49.659
of money.
 

00:36:49.659 --> 00:36:52.978
They have broad product lines,
they have big cash flows,

00:36:52.978 --> 00:36:55.030
and they spend a lot on
R&amp;D.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:58.079
You, some little pip squeak
making Heartport,

00:36:58.079 --> 00:37:03.097
are going to rack your whole
business on the idea that you

00:37:03.097 --> 00:37:05.507
don't--
you can attack these guys by

00:37:05.507 --> 00:37:08.382
saying they're going to have--
you're going back to the

00:37:08.382 --> 00:37:10.375
hospital a lot,
you can be sure they know

00:37:10.375 --> 00:37:13.070
that's an issue for their
company and they're throwing a

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.150
lot of money at it.
 

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.400
In fact, what we see in this
business is actually we get,

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.902
very shortly after this
position, a new drug eluding

00:37:20.902 --> 00:37:23.719
stint that allows for less
restenosis,

00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:27.199
that they have spent many,
many, many millions of dollars

00:37:27.199 --> 00:37:27.510
on.
 

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.983
I think it is very dangerous to
stick with the two vessel thing

00:37:31.983 --> 00:37:35.880
because you know these guys (a)
in the first place,

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.460
you don't have the value
proposition for consumers,

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:41.779
and (b) you've got very strong
competitors who have a lot of

00:37:41.779 --> 00:37:44.929
money to throw at a particular
problem that they have.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.619
Just a couple more things we
want to think about.

00:37:47.619 --> 00:37:51.315
The training issues;
if I'm actually going to make

00:37:51.315 --> 00:37:55.487
this work in this business I
have got what economists would

00:37:55.487 --> 00:37:58.079
call a complement--
with an "e",

00:37:58.079 --> 00:38:01.518
not an "i."
 

00:38:01.518 --> 00:38:05.742
I've got to somehow--this kit
doesn't do it itself,

00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:09.119
this kit is used by doctors,
surgeons;

00:38:09.119 --> 00:38:11.809
so I've got to figure out a way
to train those guys.

00:38:11.809 --> 00:38:15.838
In the case they talk about
some of the ways they try to

00:38:15.838 --> 00:38:17.230
train these guys.
 

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:19.920
One is they offer them trips to
Hawaii.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.329
What's the problem with the
trips to Hawaii to learn?

00:38:24.329 --> 00:38:27.452
Student:  A lot of the
doctors are coming there just to

00:38:27.452 --> 00:38:30.320
look at the actual product not
to learn how to use it.

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.664
It's like they've heard about
it, they're interested just to

00:38:32.664 --> 00:38:34.655
learn more about it,
not actually apply it,

00:38:34.655 --> 00:38:37.641
and it turned out that I think
actually only two people stayed

00:38:37.641 --> 00:38:40.579
for the surgery on the pig to
see what actually happened.

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:42.139
Sharon Oster:
 Good, and since you're an

00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:43.969
econ major we'll test you a
little more on the econ.

00:38:43.969 --> 00:38:47.510
There's a problem in economics
known as the selection problem,

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:50.469
so how does the selection
problem play into this?

00:38:50.469 --> 00:38:53.110
What kind of doctors go to
Hawaii?

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:55.440
Student:  What kind of
doctors go to Hawaii?

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.960
Doctors that like beaches.
 

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.572
Sharon Oster:
 Okay, they like beaches,

00:38:59.572 --> 00:39:02.880
and when they go to Hawaii I'm
paying for their transport,

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.679
but what am I not covering?
 

00:39:04.679 --> 00:39:06.289
What's the magic word--there
are only three magic--

00:39:06.289 --> 00:39:07.179
Student: Opportunity
costs.

00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:08.384
Sharon Oster:
 Oh, thank you,

00:39:08.384 --> 00:39:09.210
that's the magic word.
 

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.978
Student:  So I guess it
would, if we follow that logic,

00:39:11.978 --> 00:39:14.793
it's doctors that go to Hawaii
instead of being paid heftily by

00:39:14.793 --> 00:39:15.429
hospitals.
 

00:39:15.429 --> 00:39:16.429
Sharon Oster:
 You bet,

00:39:16.429 --> 00:39:18.737
so a strategy that says,
"Come to Hawaii,"

00:39:18.737 --> 00:39:21.900
attracts a bunch of doctors who
aren't doing many surgeries,

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:24.230
because they've got plenty of
time to come to Hawaii.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:27.005
The people that I want to
attract are the people that are

00:39:27.005 --> 00:39:29.780
doing a lot of surgeries because
they are an annuity,

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:32.059
a word for those of you that
are interested in finance.

00:39:32.059 --> 00:39:34.146
Once I teach them,
every year they do more

00:39:34.146 --> 00:39:37.048
surgeries, every year I don't
have to keep reteaching them

00:39:37.048 --> 00:39:38.730
every year they do something.
 

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:40.974
Moreover, I want the guys who
are in teaching hospitals like

00:39:40.974 --> 00:39:43.409
Yale because they're going to
teach all the guys behind them,

00:39:43.409 --> 00:39:45.952
and I want them to be big
users, and that's why most of

00:39:45.952 --> 00:39:48.777
the training for these kind of
things actually happens in the

00:39:48.777 --> 00:39:49.389
hospital.
 

00:39:49.389 --> 00:39:51.610
It doesn't happen in Hawaii.
 

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:53.693
Hawaii sounds great to somebody
who doesn't know anything about

00:39:53.693 --> 00:39:54.030
doctors.
 

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.657
What you want to do is you want
to go where they are,

00:39:56.657 --> 00:39:59.436
train them where they are,
where there's low opportunity

00:39:59.436 --> 00:40:01.610
cost of learning as a way to
capturing.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:07.018
Still it's going to be a tricky
piece to try to do it.

00:40:07.018 --> 00:40:12.690
We have a situation in which it
looks like a good idea;

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:17.396
we've got big hurdles to go
over in terms of actually having

00:40:17.396 --> 00:40:19.949
a value add that's meaningful.
 

00:40:19.949 --> 00:40:23.621
Suppose I could,
suppose I did have something

00:40:23.621 --> 00:40:28.146
that I convinced--
I got enough dotors to know how

00:40:28.146 --> 00:40:30.469
to do it,
I got enough stories to

00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:33.315
consumers and others that I got
around intervention

00:40:33.315 --> 00:40:35.581
cardiologists--
there's a lot of ifs about

00:40:35.581 --> 00:40:38.159
this--and I'm getting some
penetration of this thing.

00:40:38.159 --> 00:40:42.690
Now what am I worried about?
 

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:43.518
Yeah.
 

00:40:43.518 --> 00:40:44.840
Student:  Is insurance
going to cover it.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.039
Sharon Oster:
 Okay I could worry

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:47.268
about--is insurance going to
cover it?

00:40:47.268 --> 00:40:50.115
But suppose I got that,
I've managed to convince those

00:40:50.115 --> 00:40:53.445
insurance companies that this is
going to get people out of the

00:40:53.445 --> 00:40:56.480
hospital faster;
this is going to be a good deal.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.139
Here I am just starting to make
money.

00:40:59.139 --> 00:41:03.880
What do we know when you're
just starting to make money?

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.590
What happens to you?
 

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:09.380
What kind of a science is
economics?

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:13.510
The dismal science;
why is it the dismal science?

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:16.750
Because the minute you start
making money what happens?

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:17.400
Student:  People enter
the market.

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:18.699
Sharon Oster:
 People enter the market.

00:41:18.699 --> 00:41:21.639
That's the glory of why prices
come down.

00:41:21.639 --> 00:41:26.030
In this situation what kind of
a product do we have?

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.510
We have a little platform for a
beating heart.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:35.320
When we convince the doctors to
adapt it,

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:38.898
we want it to have something
that was going to look pretty

00:41:38.898 --> 00:41:40.789
generic,
because I wanted to give

00:41:40.789 --> 00:41:43.197
doctors some sense of,
"You can learn how to make

00:41:43.197 --> 00:41:45.268
this,
and I'm not going to hold you

00:41:45.268 --> 00:41:46.570
up eventually."
 

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:51.186
The easier it is to copy,
however, the more problem I

00:41:51.186 --> 00:41:53.139
have from new entry.
 

00:41:53.139 --> 00:41:57.793
Even if I can crack this
problem by attracting the right

00:41:57.793 --> 00:42:00.119
buyers,
solving the complimentary

00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:03.376
problem, changing myself
technologically to hit the only

00:42:03.376 --> 00:42:06.869
part of the market in which I
have a chance to compete,

00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:10.193
I'm going to have a problem
that I'm going to have the risk

00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:11.570
of new guys coming in.
 

00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:16.583
The more attractive I make this
from a generic point of view in

00:42:16.583 --> 00:42:20.882
the beginning of my market,
the more problem I'm going to

00:42:20.882 --> 00:42:24.050
have protecting it in a later
part of my market.

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:27.713
That, in some sense,
is really the Schumpeterian

00:42:27.713 --> 00:42:32.471
story that says to me the nature
of an innovation is coming in

00:42:32.471 --> 00:42:36.916
against existing players with
something you hope will be a

00:42:36.916 --> 00:42:38.320
better idea.
 

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.233
Then worrying in the end about
other people who are going to

00:42:42.233 --> 00:42:44.963
imitate you,
until finally there are enough

00:42:44.963 --> 00:42:48.545
of them until another newcomer
comes in with another disruptive

00:42:48.545 --> 00:42:51.840
innovation that looks better
than what you had before.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:43:00.889
I have to actually go teach my
MBAs and so your last five

00:43:00.889 --> 00:43:08.809
minutes Mr. Rae is going to
complete for you.

00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:16.289
Prof: As you can see
she's done that before.

00:43:16.289 --> 00:43:25.016
Now the question the syllabus
poses for you is concerned with

00:43:25.016 --> 00:43:31.722
social learning,
with whether the market and

00:43:31.722 --> 00:43:39.751
companies like this one are
instruments by which society

00:43:39.751 --> 00:43:46.030
learns through both success and
failure.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:51.159
Does anybody see a learning
component to this?

00:43:51.159 --> 00:43:54.159
Let's get a mic for somebody.
 

00:43:54.159 --> 00:43:59.380
Let's go to purple shirt right
here.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.210
What's the learning process
here?

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.467
Student:  Do you mean
the learning process for the

00:44:04.467 --> 00:44:05.840
players in this particular case?
 

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.648
Prof: Well I mean
something more abstract and

00:44:09.648 --> 00:44:10.320
bigger.
 

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:15.880
Is society smarter in any
important way toward the end of

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:20.050
this story than it was at the
beginning?

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:22.585
Student:  I suppose
it--I suppose it depends on

00:44:22.585 --> 00:44:24.929
whether the new product ends up
being adapted,

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:28.150
because if it--I mean if it
ends up being sort of accepted,

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:30.630
because then in which case
we've had a technological

00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:32.869
innovation that will maybe save
some lives,

00:44:32.869 --> 00:44:36.041
reduce some recovery time,
but if the product never enters

00:44:36.041 --> 00:44:39.500
the market--
I mean, I guess if there's this

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.458
pressure to innovate,
even if it doesn't enter the

00:44:42.458 --> 00:44:44.327
market,
maybe the angioplasty guys will

00:44:44.327 --> 00:44:47.293
be out there trying to compete
even though it's not really a

00:44:47.293 --> 00:44:48.300
major competitor.
 

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:51.753
Prof: Okay so in actual
fact there's a learning story

00:44:51.753 --> 00:44:55.150
with a yes answer and a learning
story with a no answer.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:59.130
The learning story with the yes
answer is very obvious.

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:03.713
The learning answer with the
failure story is partly that we

00:45:03.713 --> 00:45:07.599
know one bad idea so we don't
have to repeat it.

00:45:07.599 --> 00:45:10.666
In addition,
it's part of a larger

00:45:10.666 --> 00:45:16.059
incentivation process which
compels everyone to be thinking

00:45:16.059 --> 00:45:22.010
about the next step beyond what
they already know how to do.

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:28.045
In the case for Monday,
which is its URL is posted on

00:45:28.045 --> 00:45:32.204
class as V2;
we have the Polaroid Land

00:45:32.204 --> 00:45:35.449
camera, invented by Edwin Land.
 

00:45:35.449 --> 00:45:45.396
It is a less bloody story that
is a little like the one we just

00:45:45.396 --> 00:45:46.360
did.
 

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:52.289
The difference is that it is
closer to the mass consumer and

00:45:52.289 --> 00:45:57.815
is in that way a more typical
Schumpeter story about how

00:45:57.815 --> 00:46:03.945
innovation in consumer products
disturbs an old equilibrium in

00:46:03.945 --> 00:46:09.875
conventional photography and
then becomes a defender against

00:46:09.875 --> 00:46:17.010
a new disruptive technology with
the emergence of digitization.

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.190
We'll see you on Monday.
 

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:23.000

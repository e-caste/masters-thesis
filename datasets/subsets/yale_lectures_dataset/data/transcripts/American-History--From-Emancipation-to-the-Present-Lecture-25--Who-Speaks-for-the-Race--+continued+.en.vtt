00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.700
We're at that moment.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.667
Pardon me a second here.

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.667
You know, I always find
it shocking that you,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.100
you get to spring
break, and you come back,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.400
and you're like, "Oh
my god, six more weeks.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.900
How am I going to survive?"

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.900
And the next thing you know,
we're at the last week of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.100
class, the last lecture.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.000
And since it is
the last lecture,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.267
I want to do a quick
survey of the course,

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:37.267
and this is truly a quick
survey of the course through

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:39.300
a whole host of keywords.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.067
This is not meant to
sum up the entire course,

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:44.867
and I'm not saying that all
these keywords are going to

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.700
help you understand
your final paper or ace,

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.367
you know, the in-class exam,
for those of you who are

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:51.700
going to be taking it.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.367
But they, I think,
will--they are there to spur

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.500
more reflection and thought
about critical moments,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.600
themes,
ideologies for the class.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.000
And then I do want to bring
us up to our contemporary

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.967
moment and wrestle for a
little bit about some of the

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:08.100
lessons, discussions,
ideas from the past,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.400
and how they resonate
in our present time.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
So--is this working?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400
Excellent.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
Okay.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.600
So it should--unless you're
coming to the class for the

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.867
first time
today, not pre-frosh,

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:24.867
who might be here, but
people in the class,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.067
if, if I have to
linger over citizenship,

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:33.767
I wish you much luck
for the end of the term.

00:01:33.767 --> 00:01:36.367
Citizenship is one of the,
the fundamental issues that

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.200
I've been talking about
throughout this course,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.767
whether it's the active
attempt to deny citizenship

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.900
in the, in the
pre-emancipatory moment and

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.600
the
post-emancipatory moment,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.867
or whether it's just the
various ways individuals,

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:54.600
state actors, ideologies
have worked to police who

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.500
could belong and not belong
in the American pantheon.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.600
Representation, I'm
talking about it,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.600
how--I, I mean, think about
it in the way that we use

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.000
cultural symbols to
represent other things,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.767
the ways in which different
ideologies of the self,

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.467
in terms of racialized
self-representation,

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.200
ethnic, sexual
orientation, gender,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.767
all of these things
representing a whole body,

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:22.100
as it were, of political
positions and ideologies.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.767
One of the great things
that is there through the

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:29.500
beginning of the course and
all the way to the present

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.667
day is really the wrestling
and the balance between

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.900
where does one's rights
as an individuals run

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.300
into--[Student
Sneezes] Bless you--run,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.900
run into larger issues
dealing with the social

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.800
fabric, individual liberty
versus social equality.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.600
And you can certainly
translate that into,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.267
metaphorically, into states'
rights versus federal rights

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:50.267
as well.

00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:56.767
This is a major thing that
we've been talking about,

00:02:56.767 --> 00:02:58.967
I've been trying to impart
to you the last couple of

00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:01.067
lectures, certainly, but
it's been there throughout

00:03:01.067 --> 00:03:06.067
the course, the great divide
between the rhetoric of our

00:03:06.067 --> 00:03:08.200
political leaders or
our political activists,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.100
politically engaged people,
and what social reality is.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.667
This is certainly an
important thing to wrestle

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:18.667
with, think about, in
the last twenty or thirty

00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:21.767
years--well, gosh, now
thirty or forty years,

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.567
in our post-civil
rights movement era.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:27.900
But how can we talk about
race as it's lived on the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.600
ground, and not--as a
politician or activist?

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.667
How can I talk about race
as it's lived on the ground

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:36.767
without being tarred,
correctly or incorrectly,

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:38.800
as being racialist or
racist in my thinking?

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.600
Dealing with issues of
leadership of course,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600
and uplift.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.067
These come together,
certainly if you think back

00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:50.867
to earlier part of the
course and the complicated

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:55.100
politics, often class
politics and gender

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.767
politics, all woven
through with race politics,

00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:00.000
about what does uplift mean?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.467
What does it mean
to lead the race?

00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:05.300
Uplift them to what,
uplift them from what?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.500
Uplift them, but so far.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.400
These are all these kinds
of things we talked about.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.000
Chronologically speaking,
mainly I talked about them

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
at the turn of the century
going into the twentieth

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
century.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.467
Part of uplift, part of
uplift is respectability,

00:04:22.467 --> 00:04:24.467
people acting in a
respectable fashion,

00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:27.500
but that's certainly not
a phenomenon that limits

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.400
itself to the late
nineteenth century,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.700
early twentieth century.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.500
I mean, think of the
images of the civil rights

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.567
activists that we saw, that,
that we've grown up with:

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:38.367
you know, young men and
young women having to dress

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:42.800
in a certain way, comport
themselves in a certain

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800
fashion.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.900
Think of the stories I
talked about with the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.300
Little--Little
Rock Nine or the,

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.100
the men who integrated the
Woolworth's lunch counter in

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.767
Greensboro, North Carolina,
and started the sit-in

00:04:53.767 --> 00:04:55.267
movement.

00:04:55.267 --> 00:04:57.400
Think of the way that Martin
Luther King had to present

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.800
himself, felt the
need to present himself,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.067
the test case individuals
who end up--their cases go

00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:04.967
up to the Supreme Court.

00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:08.367
They had to reflect or
embody the kind of values

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:10.167
that they felt the
nation could understand.

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:13.300
These are the most
respectable people,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.200
and how can we deny them
their citizenship rights?

00:05:19.067 --> 00:05:21.000
Gender, of course, and
its see--and its seeming

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
invisibility.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Throughout the
course and its readings,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.300
I know in sections as
well, issues have--of,

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.967
of gender have
been ever present.

00:05:31.967 --> 00:05:34.167
They're always present,
and in some weeks more

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:38.800
explicitly than others, but
the way in which women's and

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.100
men's rights or, quote,
"sensibilities"--I use that

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.300
term very gently in a fully
loaded fashion--shift how we

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:50.867
deal with individual
rights, social equality,

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:52.867
certainly, who
can be a citizen?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.100
Thinking of
things on the ground,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.267
you have the migrations,
the Great Migration

00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:00.900
her--happening in the
early part of the twentieth

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.000
century, the much larger
migration as far as numbers

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.567
happening in the
1940s and 1950s,

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:11.667
and coming along with
the relocation of African

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:15.300
American bodies is also
the relocation of African

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.367
American culture, forms
of cultural expression,

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:22.800
politics, organizing
logics, traditions,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.300
and also
resistance, and unrest,

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.200
and riots, and bloodshed.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.800
At different moments in
the course I talked about

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.800
cultural politics, whether
the Harlem Renaissance or

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.700
the New Negro Renaissance,
and introduced the idea,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.600
at least for this course,
about the belief by many of

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.467
the leaders of the
Renaissance that practicing

00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:47.167
cultural
politics in this way,

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:52.767
talking about exceptional
cultural talents of the

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:58.167
race, was absolutely
a politicized act.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.600
That by recognizing the
cultural gifts of black

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.800
people in the world,
think to the connections,

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.967
the complicated connections,
to African cultural roots,

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:10.700
but by talking about the
cultural gifts of African

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.267
Americans, the nation would
understand these people have

00:07:16.267 --> 00:07:18.800
made a contribution and they
needed to be recognized in

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.667
such a way and have
their citizenship rights

00:07:20.667 --> 00:07:21.667
respected.

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:23.000
Certainly
throughout the course,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.700
we've been talking
about political radicalism,

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.700
but, you know, keep in
mind this is chronologically

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.700
contingent.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.167
The NAACP were a bunch of
crazy radicals--The leaders

00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:39.267
of the NAACP were a bunch
of crazy radicals in 1909,

00:07:39.267 --> 00:07:41.467
always espousing
middle-class norms,

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:43.700
but still radicals.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.100
By the time you
get to mid-century,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.800
they aren't
necessarily the radicals,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.900
you know, and they're trying
to silence people like

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.300
Rob--Robert Williams,
saying blacks need to arm

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.300
themselves.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:59.767
It's like, "We can't have
that in our association."

00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:02.167
And then by the
sixties and seventies,

00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:04.600
you know, they're
yesterday's news as far as

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.300
the young
radicals are concerned.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.400
What is radical is
contingent upon time and

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400
place.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.000
Certainly when you think
about the civil rights

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.900
movement in
particular, as I,

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.067
you know, remember, I slowed
down the pace of the course

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:20.700
dramatically, because the
iconography of the civil

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.767
rights movement
is so powerful,

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:25.100
it's one of the defining
characteristics of our,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.400
of our modern--I mean modern
in the last forty years,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.900
let's say--of our modern
conception of what it means

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.700
to be an American.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:36.000
It means that we all
supported Martin Luther

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.100
King, after all.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:43.067
We all overcame, you know,
the struggles that people

00:08:43.067 --> 00:08:46.600
with a less sharp
vision created.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.200
Well, the fact is,
that's all a myth.

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:53.500
There's only a minority of
a minority who were on the

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.700
front lines with
King and other people,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.600
and of course, King being
iconographic himself and

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.600
many other people involved.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.600
And there's
profound resistance,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.200
individual,
institutional, cultural,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.700
to change in the movement.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.067
But the iconography gives us
a kind of simplified notion

00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:17.967
of the civil rights history
that does a disservice to

00:09:17.967 --> 00:09:19.500
all the real
struggles on the ground,

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500
and all the complications
that come along with being a

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.500
human being.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.600
Talk of the
triumphs of--I mean,

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.467
two great iconographic
moments were the signing of

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:35.600
the Civil Rights Act and
the Voting Rights Act.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.100
Moments where it seems that
African Americans finally

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.567
had their full
rights as citizens.

00:09:39.567 --> 00:09:43.700
But you need to understand,
this might connect across

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.600
the way to political
rhetoric versus social

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.200
reality.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.967
So you can pass all the
laws you want to pass,

00:09:50.967 --> 00:09:52.667
but unless you
enforce those laws,

00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:58.300
it doesn't mean anything.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:02.100
So the Civil Rights and
Voting Rights Acts were

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.900
signed and ushered in a, a
new day for all American

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:05.900
citizens.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.067
There's no
minimizing that fact;

00:10:07.067 --> 00:10:08.700
it did.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.100
But you also have to
look at enforcement,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.667
you have to wrestle
with the phenomenon that,

00:10:15.667 --> 00:10:17.300
say, the Supreme
Court in Brown v.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.367
Board, saying
"we need to end,

00:10:19.367 --> 00:10:22.700
end segregation with
all deliberate speed."

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:25.000
And these things are still
tied up in court cases,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
to this day.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.800
Enforcement being very
critical when it comes to

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.800
citizenship
rights and the law.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.300
Heading more towards
our contemporary moment,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.000
of course, where we've been
for the last four weeks of

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
the course--no, I'm
sorry, last two weeks of the

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.900
course--with greater
focus is post-civil rights

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.400
America.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:54.000
What does it mean to
be post-civil rights?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.067
Historians are actually
actively debating this right

00:10:56.067 --> 00:10:59.767
now, wondering if we ever
got to a post-civil rights

00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:05.300
moment, and also wondering,
did the civil rights--and

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.400
I've already mentioned
this in the course,

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.400
did the civil
rights movement begin,

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.100
say, in '54?

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.100
Can you actually
identify the beginning?

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.000
Did it end in '68?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.600
Can you identify an
ending, actually?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.600
So, we all use the
phrase post-civil rights,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.600
I mean, I use it as well.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.867
But we need to understand
that it's loaded with

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:25.867
complications.

00:11:25.867 --> 00:11:29.567
It's a highly nuanced term
that's never thought about

00:11:29.567 --> 00:11:34.367
in a nuanced way or
used in a nuanced way,

00:11:34.367 --> 00:11:36.367
except for you guys
after this class.

00:11:38.267 --> 00:11:39.767
Racial symbolism has
been there from the very

00:11:39.767 --> 00:11:43.100
beginning, the
founding of this country,

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.000
before the
founding of this country.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.700
It is a phenomenon that
exists as long as people

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:50.700
have eyeballs.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.000
Now, it is a defining
characteristic of this

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
country.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.700
It's--John Hope Franklin,
the historian I mentioned in

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.500
the last lecture, who
headed up the President's

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:09.000
commission on the, the
National Conversation on

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.500
Race, you know, said this
is America's original sin.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.900
This is the scar that
really defines the country.

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.667
Angela Oh
disagreed with him to the,

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:20.600
to the extent to which he
thought--she thought that

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.000
that was a really useful way
of thinking about things,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.167
but the fact is, as I
mentioned in the very first

00:12:26.167 --> 00:12:27.867
lecture, that--arguing you
cannot understand American

00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:30.400
freedom, one of our
most core values,

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.667
without
understanding slavery.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.800
And you can't
understand slavery without

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.567
understanding its
racial dynamics.

00:12:38.567 --> 00:12:43.900
Of course, racial symbolism
carries forward till today

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.067
and that's what I'll
actually be talking about a

00:12:46.067 --> 00:12:47.400
fair amount in
today's lecture,

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400
about just that.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.667
And, in fact, as
I think about it,

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:55.800
this used to be the last
keyword I'd have on the

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800
screen.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.300
There's many other words
I could pick and choose,

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.800
but I thought this was a
nice way to get into the

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.100
lecture on racial symbolism.

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.300
But now we've got
this one to deal with,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.600
"post-racial."

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.167
What does it mean?

00:13:08.167 --> 00:13:10.300
What can it possibly mean?

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.667
I mean, the, the, the, the
simple answer is that we've

00:13:13.667 --> 00:13:16.367
now come to a place
that as a country,

00:13:16.367 --> 00:13:20.300
we've elected an
African American President.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.067
Who that we is,
is contingent,

00:13:22.067 --> 00:13:25.167
of course, and even an
African American President

00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:27.967
is contingent, of course.

00:13:27.967 --> 00:13:30.467
But now that we have
done this great thing,

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.200
we can now get past this
great burden that has--that

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.800
we have of being consumed
with racial politics,

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.500
everybody.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.700
And, goodness, I'm
forgetting the talking head

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.767
that said as much, but after
Barack Obama's election,

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:54.967
it's like, "Look,
African Americans,

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:56.900
basically you've got nothing
else to complain--I don't

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.500
want to hear any
more whining."

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.500
Who was that?

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.500
Somebody here knows this.

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.600
It wasn't Chris Matthews.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.867
He thought for a second
he was going to be able to

00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:09.600
forget Barack Obama's
black, for about an hour,

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600
he was that--that was a
triumphant moment for him.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.700
I'm forgetting who it was,
but it was actually a quite

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.100
famous comment
that, "All right,

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.700
you have nothing
else to complain about.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.400
You've, you've got
your guy in office."

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.800
What does it mean
to be post-racial?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.667
I actually had a
conversation about this the

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:27.500
night after Barack
Obama was elected.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.400
I was in Commons--Calhoun
was in renovation then--and

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.067
there was one other student.

00:14:33.067 --> 00:14:34.600
I was getting there late,
and there was one other

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.100
student from
Calhoun in the section,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.200
so I sat down
across from her.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.100
I'm like, "Wow, this is
quite a remarkable moment,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.100
isn't it?"

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.700
And she said,
"Professor Holloway,

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:46.900
we just, you know, we, of
our generation (which is a

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.800
reminder of yes, I
was twice her age),

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.667
you know, we don't think
about these things this way.

00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:54.700
We're post-racial."

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.500
And, you know, I don't
want to overburden the race,

00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:59.300
but this is an African
American student I happened

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.967
to be sitting across from.

00:15:00.967 --> 00:15:02.800
And she goes, you know,
"This is something that your

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.600
generation
(thanks, once again,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.300
for reminding me I'm twice
your age) that you guys are

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.500
all con--consumed by."

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.200
And the--What she
wouldn't know is,

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.767
you know, I don't
remember any of this stuff.

00:15:12.767 --> 00:15:15.000
I was too young for that
consum--consumptive moment

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.500
of the civil rights era.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.400
That's the
moment of my birth.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.300
So she was like, "We
just don't talk about these

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.300
things.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.300
We don't think
about these things."

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.700
And I walked away from
that conversation thinking,

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.100
"My god, she's
actually right."

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:29.967
That we don't talk about
these things and we don't

00:15:29.967 --> 00:15:32.000
think about these
things, but is,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.500
is that what it
means to be post-racial?

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.600
And if it does, I'd say
we're actually in a whole

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.600
bunch of trouble.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.800
Is it a generational change,
or is it something a little

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.800
more complicated?

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.100
And I'll argue that
it's more complicated.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:52.267
So that was the night--the
day after Obama was elected,

00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:53.600
and then of course
he's inaugurated.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.967
And it was
fascinating to me,

00:15:56.967 --> 00:15:58.567
I mentioned this once
before in the lecture,

00:15:58.567 --> 00:16:00.100
that this--I
mean inaugurations,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.667
regardless of
who's taking office,

00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:06.000
pretty phenomenal moment,
and a moment I get very

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.267
patriotic about, even if I
don't like the person who's

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.500
taking office.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.900
The peaceful
transition of power,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.900
it's an astonishing thing.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:15.967
But as the--and the,
and the inauguration,

00:16:15.967 --> 00:16:18.300
I mean the pomp and
circumstance and all the,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.700
you know, the symbolic
weight of the moment is,

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.700
I think, really
quite powerful.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.800
This inauguration was
really quite different.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.767
It was texturally rich
in a way that an--other

00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:31.000
inaugurations weren't,
and this from somebody who

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
studies the
African American past.

00:16:35.667 --> 00:16:37.867
You have Aretha Franklin
singing "My Country,

00:16:37.867 --> 00:16:40.300
'Tis of Thee."

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.600
You know because I've
offered the prompt,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.800
I think that's
kind of important,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.300
for reasons I'll
let you explore.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.800
You have
Reverend Joseph Lowry,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.700
a leader of the Southern
Christian Leadership

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.100
Conference, one of
King's inner circle,

00:16:53.767 --> 00:16:56.800
gets up to offer his prayer.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.800
And a
fascinating thing happens,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.800
sort of after the fact.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.200
From the first moment
he gets up there and,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.400
and starts
talking, I'm like,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.867
"Wow, this is
really powerful.

00:17:06.867 --> 00:17:08.567
I know exactly
what he's doing.

00:17:08.567 --> 00:17:12.800
He's reading, narrating,
the first words of the,

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.800
quote, 'National Black
Anthem.'" And what was

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.567
astonishing to discover
is that in a way that I,

00:17:22.567 --> 00:17:24.900
I just sort of
found amazing,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:26.600
in a sense that I was
so close to the topic,

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.400
I didn't think that others
didn't get what was going

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.100
on, but that
the inaug--that,

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:35.800
that many people,
white Americans,

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.400
and other
Americans, different types,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.167
and certainly some
black Americans as well,

00:17:39.167 --> 00:17:42.567
had no idea what he
was talking about,

00:17:42.567 --> 00:17:44.700
when he was reciting the
lines to "Lift Every Voice

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.267
and Sing."

00:17:47.267 --> 00:17:49.800
And it made it clear to me,
is that that inauguration,

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.300
from a textual
point of view,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.367
was experienced in
very different ways.

00:17:53.367 --> 00:17:54.900
There's the obvious point
of view: there's a black

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.467
President, you know,
overwhelmingly--overwhelming

00:17:57.467 --> 00:17:59.800
majority, a supermajority of
African Americans voting for

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.200
him, a, a mixed bag
depending on different

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:06.000
categories beyond that, of
who voted for Barack Obama.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
So it's the obvious way in
which the inauguration's

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.100
experienced differently.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.200
But from a
textual standpoint,

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.900
and the way in which the
inauguration was really

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:18.800
quite historically minded,
was really quite something,

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.367
and the way that that
history was experienced or

00:18:21.367 --> 00:18:25.200
acknowledged differently,
that many people basically

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.967
didn't understand the
subtext of Aretha Franklin's

00:18:29.967 --> 00:18:33.400
performance, or the
subtext of Reverend Lowry's

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.000
performance, or even
the night when Obama was

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.600
elected, at Grant
Park in Chicago,

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.467
his invocation of words that
are sort of central to the

00:18:42.467 --> 00:18:44.900
civil rights
movement heritage,

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.300
quotes Martin Luther King,
but never references King.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.500
It's really quite
something, actually,

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:57.900
the way in which Obama or
his inner circle are making

00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.500
all of these connections
often to the African

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.400
American past,
without referencing it.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.900
Maybe that's
post-racial, I don't know.

00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:13.300
Now when Obama was
running for office,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.100
so two years ago, in this
course at the one of the

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.400
very first
lectures, I was saying,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.867
you know, "Look, I'm not
going to talk--"--you know,

00:19:23.867 --> 00:19:26.467
Hillary Rodham Clinton
and, and Barack Obama were

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:28.300
shaping up to be the
major contenders for the

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.467
Democratic Party,
the nomination,

00:19:30.467 --> 00:19:32.600
and I told the class,
"Look, I know this is rather

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600
important.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600
Of course it's important.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.000
It's an historic
elec--election for the

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Democrats no matter what.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.600
I'm not going to talk about
it at the beginning of the

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.600
course.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.600
I'll talk about it
in the last lecture."

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.600
What I wasn't telling
the students is like "when

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.067
Hillary Rodham Clinton will
probably heading--be heading

00:19:45.067 --> 00:19:47.100
towards the nomination,
and Barack Obama will have

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.200
dropped out."

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.400
In my head, it's
what I was thinking.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.267
Thinking of the
history of, of,

00:19:53.267 --> 00:19:58.467
like the "Angry Hands"
advertisement with Harvey

00:19:58.467 --> 00:20:01.000
Gantt and Jesse Helms, I
frankly presumed it was just

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.800
a matter of time when we
started going to the ballot

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.267
boxes and the, the
voting booths that,

00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:10.500
although people were curious
and excited about this

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.867
eloquent junior senator,
that when it came to

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:19.200
actually casting the vote
that--I thought that Hillary

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.200
Clinton would
basically run away with it.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.067
And then Obama goes on what
was an eleven state tear,

00:20:26.067 --> 00:20:27.267
something like that, crushes
the history of what Jesse

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.267
Jackson had done.

00:20:28.267 --> 00:20:32.800
And I'm realizing
during the course,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.200
like "Oh boy, I've got
to rewrite the end of my

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.200
course."

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.867
This is act--something,
something different is

00:20:36.867 --> 00:20:39.700
happening here.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:45.467
And then, as we are heading
towards spring break,

00:20:45.467 --> 00:20:46.667
that moment of,
you know, "Boy,

00:20:46.667 --> 00:20:48.700
we're all so tired and we've
just got to struggle through

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.600
the last six
weeks of the course,

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:56.600
 then the news starts to
break about Reverend Wright,

00:20:58.767 --> 00:21:02.367
Obama's pastor in,
in Trinity Church,

00:21:02.367 --> 00:21:05.300
Rev--Reverend Jeremiah
Wright and his racial views,

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.867
a church that he'd been
leading for a long time and

00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:09.867
Obama had gone to.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.600
And what happened
next was actually,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.600
I thought,
rather predictable.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:14.967
There's lots and
lots of hot air,

00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:17.500
all sides of the
political--all spots in the

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.067
political spectrum weighing
in about Reverend Wright's

00:21:22.067 --> 00:21:24.300
racism, or his
racial honesty,

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.000
and everything in between,
and where--what's Obama

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.400
thinking?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.400
What happened
after that was,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.800
I thought, quite
astonishing though.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.500
Obama gives his so-called
race speech in Philadelphia,

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.400
"A More Perfect Union,"
that two years ago in the

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.900
edition--actually,
even last year,

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.300
I believe, in the
edition of the,

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.100
the Manning Marable
reader--was it even in last

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.100
year's edition?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.467
No, it wasn't there yet.

00:21:47.467 --> 00:21:48.800
They, they
re-purposed the book,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.800
and that's in
the documents now.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:59.367
Now there was the expected
repudiation of some of

00:21:59.367 --> 00:22:01.500
Wright's views in
Obama's speech.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.867
People expected that.

00:22:02.867 --> 00:22:06.600
But, remarkably,
there wasn't an apology.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.600
It's kind of astonishing.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:20.067
Obama addressed in his
speech Wright's ideas,

00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:23.800
as one would expect,
distanced himself from some

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.900
of them, but he
gave a lecture really,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.500
and I think lecture is
the appropriate word,

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.167
on the scar of race
throughout American history.

00:22:32.167 --> 00:22:36.700
It was an acknowledgement
that everyone had to be more

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.100
honest about
racism, everyone,

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.800
about the racism
they express or feel,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.500
and that they had to
recognize that race was

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.200
often used as a
veil, as it were,

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.967
to mask other issues.

00:22:49.967 --> 00:22:52.000
Think back to Du
Bois where, you know,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.667
people who were
black hid behind a veil,

00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:55.800
or put--society put a
veil in front of them.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.367
Obama's talking
about a different way,

00:22:57.367 --> 00:23:01.500
that race is the actual
veil that's shielding,

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:06.267
hiding,
obfuscating other issues.

00:23:06.267 --> 00:23:09.200
Obama also said that there
were lingering scars that we

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.067
as a nation had to admit to.

00:23:12.067 --> 00:23:15.600
We had to admit to all of
this and recognize that the

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.767
feelings were
still very real,

00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:22.700
and that Wright's
views made sense,

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:24.900
even though they might sound
repugnant to many people,

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.600
that they made sense to
many people as well in the

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:28.867
African American community.

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:32.367
And that if we're ever to
get beyond any of this,

00:23:37.167 --> 00:23:40.300
it was time that we actually
be honest about this scar,

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.600
and how we can
make a better world.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.900
It's a powerful speech.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.067
I was actually on spring
vacation and really trying

00:23:47.067 --> 00:23:48.067
to be on spring vacation.

00:23:48.067 --> 00:23:50.000
I was in Florida
with my family.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.267
And I knew that he was
going to give this speech,

00:23:54.267 --> 00:23:56.400
but I also knew
that I had, you know,

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.600
rented a boat that I was
going to--by goodness,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:23:59.867
I was going to
take that boat out,

00:23:59.867 --> 00:24:01.800
and so I was going
to miss the speech.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.000
And I get, we get
back after the day,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.567
and there's
messages on my email,

00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:08.900
email and my voice mail,
from different reporters

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.900
wanting comment.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.600
I'm like, "Oh, guess
the speech actually was

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.100
well-received,
or controversial,

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.100
or something."

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.567
I didn't know the first
thing about the speech.

00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:18.200
Then I start seeing--looking
at the email more

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.000
carefully--or the
headlines, I'm sorry.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.200
"The most important
political speech in the

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.200
nation's history."

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.300
"The most important
speech since Gettysburg."

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.367
"More important than 'I
Have a Dream.'" I'm like,

00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:30.200
"Oh my, what the
heck did this man say?"

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.067
I've got to find out.

00:24:32.067 --> 00:24:34.600
So right away I
go to C-SPAN,

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.100
and they already
have it posted.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.600
So I, I watch,
listen to the speech,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.567
and what I found so
astonishing in this--I mean,

00:24:47.567 --> 00:24:49.967
I already told you the
things I thought were

00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:52.100
important about it, but a
major reason that it was

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:58.600
astonishing is that our
national discourse on race

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.800
is so impoverished that they
didn't know how to handle a

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.600
very honest and rich speech
that's full of complication

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600
and nuance.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:10.200
People didn't know
what to do with it,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.700
and certainly didn't know
what to do with it from a,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.900
a politician
running for something.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:16.500
Who gives a speech like
that when you're running for

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.500
office?

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.100
The fact is, race is
easy at its surface.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:28.100
It's--allows us to ignore
more complicated realities.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:38.900
It allows us to engage in
simple coding of behaviors,

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.700
of people, of types.

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.800
It's a social
convention, essentially,

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:54.400
that, that is in each
of us, racial thinking.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.100
And I'm not ab--I'm not
absolving myself of that

00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:58.200
either.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:00.467
I'd be a liar if I were.

00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:04.100
What I want to do for the
rest of the lecture is talk

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:09.300
about how race is used,
something historically,

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:10.300
certainly.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.800
It's all
grounded in history,

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.800
but also bringing it up to
the contemporary moment.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:19.800
I don't want to, I don't
want to overburden the

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.300
importance of the speech.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.967
It was, I think, an
important speech,

00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:30.967
certainly, but I want to
build off of sort of the way

00:26:30.967 --> 00:26:33.900
we can use moments like
this to think historically,

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.500
and with nuance, and
also about our contemporary

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.500
moments.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.500
So I want to look, talk
about how race is used.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.900
Now we know from other
moments in the course,

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.300
but also on Monday's
lecture specifically,

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.800
that race is used
to criminalize.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.400
I mean, this is something
I've made quite plain,

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.800
and you have--I
don't have it today;

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.567
it would just be repetitive,
but in the case of O.J.

00:26:56.567 --> 00:27:00.000
Simpson, certainly with
the Time magazine cover and

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.300
darkening his features to
make him look more like a

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.900
criminal.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.467
Race is used in
that way, okay,

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:10.867
but in this case, thinking
about the way that race is

00:27:10.867 --> 00:27:12.667
the veil that
hides other things.

00:27:12.667 --> 00:27:13.800
O.J.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.900
Simpson's race allows us to
ignore the fact that we're

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.800
talking about a really
wealthy man in that case.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.867
Was it about a
superstar and his ex-wife?

00:27:22.867 --> 00:27:24.700
Was it about a black person
and his--and a black man and

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.300
his white wife, ex-wife?

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.200
Or was it about
someone with a lot of power,

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.367
cultural capital and money,
and someone who doesn't have

00:27:33.367 --> 00:27:35.367
it?

00:27:36.367 --> 00:27:39.500
Race would, I mean, we got
so fixated on race in that

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.900
trial, we ignored
the class dynamic.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.000
And I only linger on
this for a half second,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.400
because at the same
time, I think in California,

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.300
a rather similar set of
circumstances transpired

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.600
with a black man
and his white wife.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.367
He did not have money.

00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:01.400
Curious sets of,
you know, evidence,

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.400
abuse, and whatever.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.400
The guy was put in jail
and never heard from again.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.000
Can't ignore the role that
money plays in a situation

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.067
like that, but race
allows us to walk around it.

00:28:12.067 --> 00:28:13.067
Race is used in that way.

00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:15.300
It's used to distract.

00:28:17.367 --> 00:28:19.200
It's used, of
course, to sell products,

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.600
and these are some
images that you may

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.800
remember--things like them
from Ethnic Notions very

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.800
early in the term, being
used to sell Cream of Wheat.

00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:33.500
It says here, "Maybe
Cream of Wheat ain't got no

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.500
vitamins.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.867
I don't know what
them things is.

00:28:35.867 --> 00:28:38.300
If they's bugs, they ain't
none in Cream of Wheat,

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.367
but she's sho' good
to eat and cheap.

00:28:40.367 --> 00:28:43.100
Cost bout 1¢ fo' a
great big dish."

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.100
Sung by Rastus,
which is one of the,

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.600
the caricatures of
the, the happy servant,

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.800
the loyal servant.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.800
Now Cream of Wheat
isn't sold this way now,

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.000
but in the early 1970s, it
had just moved away from

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.867
this.

00:28:57.867 --> 00:29:04.167
I remember, this was when I
was eating Cream of Wheat.

00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:07.367
Certainly, you know, the
vernacular dialect had

00:29:07.367 --> 00:29:12.000
disappeared at that point,
but Rastus Anonymous was

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000
still there,
selling Cream of Wheat.

00:29:16.067 --> 00:29:22.067
More famously, you have
Aunt Jemima: pancakes,

00:29:26.567 --> 00:29:29.800
southern
cooking, the matron,

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.800
the, the mammy figure, with
her natural knowledge of how

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800
to take care of people.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.800
As you head into the
1980s and nineties,

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.300
people think, you know,
"This might be a little

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.000
dated, this, you
know, Aunt Jemima figure.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.900
Maybe we should revisit it."

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:47.900
And they did, and so Aunt
Jemima lost the do-rag,

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.367
and the, you know,
the handkerchief,

00:29:49.367 --> 00:29:50.367
and the other
conventional dress,

00:29:50.367 --> 00:29:55.000
got an up-do.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.867
You can't see
on the pic--the,

00:29:56.867 --> 00:29:59.400
the, the quality of the
image is poor--a nice set of

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.200
pearls, so when she
comes back from work,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.867
like she can still make
great pancakes for you,

00:30:04.867 --> 00:30:09.300
but, but she got updated,
she got professionalized.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.700
People were getting a
little bit queasy about the

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:19.400
lingering vestiges of what
many people felt was the

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.200
racism being used
to peddle pancakes.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.067
And I'll be honest, I mean I
grew up with Aunt Jemima in

00:30:28.067 --> 00:30:30.500
the house, and for
the love of god,

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.500
I didn't understand why.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.700
I mean, I didn't have the
words or the education then

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.400
to really understand
what, what I was feeling,

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.900
but something I found
really--it kind of bothered

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:39.900
me.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.300
And I was not a little
Malcolm X running around,

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.667
you know,
trying to, you know,

00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:45.000
beat down the man
and do these things.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.467
It just didn't feel right,
but I didn't know why.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.400
Then my family
switched to Vermont Maid,

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.300
which is loaded with all
kinds of other kinds--you

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.900
know, it's, it's
all bad syrup,

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.000
frankly, but, but--and I
don't know what Aunt Jemima

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.567
pancakes taste like, because
I don't eat them anymore,

00:31:02.567 --> 00:31:05.600
but I know people
do swear by them.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.600
But if you don't
want pancakes,

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:07.600
maybe you want rice.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.900
There's Uncle Ben.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.200
Growing out of the same
tradition of Rastus and Aunt

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.800
Jemima, loyal
and happy servant,

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.067
and they're all
smiling, right?

00:31:19.067 --> 00:31:23.767
Well, Uncle Ben has
been peddling rice pilaf,

00:31:23.767 --> 00:31:25.300
basically, a whole
variety of rice products,

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:31.400
for the longest time, and
then the ad people started

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.800
getting a little nervous
about Uncle Ben and thought,

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.467
"Maybe this is not
really--let's distance

00:31:35.467 --> 00:31:36.467
ourselves from Uncle Ben."

00:31:36.467 --> 00:31:39.600
And so he disappeared
from the packages.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.000
Then about five years
ago, he reappeared.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.600
I think, I think
Proctor and Gamble,

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.667
they own pretty
much everything,

00:31:45.667 --> 00:31:47.067
decided, you
know, "It's time.

00:31:47.067 --> 00:31:48.067
I think we can do this.

00:31:48.067 --> 00:31:49.900
I think we can have a
more historically rich and

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.300
nuanced
understanding of Uncle Ben."

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.800
And so much
like Aunt Jemima,

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.900
Uncle Ben got a job.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.800
And I did not check
before today's lecture;

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.267
it was certainly
the case last year.

00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:03.467
If you go to--and
don't do it now,

00:32:03.467 --> 00:32:06.700
I mean half you guys...But,
if you go to Uncle--you

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.200
know, Google Uncle
Ben, you get the website.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.700
It's a beautiful website.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.667
You walk into the CEO's
office and guess whose

00:32:12.667 --> 00:32:13.667
office?

00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:14.900
It's Uncle Ben's office!

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.200
He's no longer
Uncle Ben, though,

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.300
he's just Ben.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.500
Still doesn't
have a last name.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.600
The first name being a
very important tradition of,

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:29.167
of southern social hierarchy
is that black men and women

00:32:29.167 --> 00:32:31.167
are always talked to
by their first name,

00:32:31.167 --> 00:32:34.067
whether it was actually
their first name or not,

00:32:34.067 --> 00:32:36.300
you know.

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:41.267
So Ben is, Ben--it's,
it's not CEO Gates;

00:32:41.267 --> 00:32:42.267
it's just Ben.

00:32:42.267 --> 00:32:46.100
And the website, it is, it
was really quite a work of

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.100
art, but in the
version five years ago,

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.100
you could walk around his
desk and open up the day

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.567
planner, and it
would talk about him,

00:32:52.567 --> 00:32:55.200
"wink, wink,"--and I'm very
closely paraphrasing--having

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.000
libations with the
southern sen--southern,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.267
southern senator.

00:32:58.267 --> 00:32:59.967
You know, "this is
the way we do business,

00:32:59.967 --> 00:33:01.300
 or something like that.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.200
I thought, "Wow, so
somebody thought it was

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:07.167
appropriate--"--I mean,
they'd already given Ben a

00:33:07.167 --> 00:33:08.167
big raise.

00:33:08.167 --> 00:33:09.167
He's the CEO.

00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:10.167
They thought it
was appropriate,

00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:16.400
though, to harken back to a
tradition of good old boys

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.400
and behaving
inappropriately,

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.700
and now CEO
Uncle, Uncle CEO,

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.300
is one of these boys.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.600
I mean, think back to Birth
of a Nation and the story of

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.000
the black
Reconstruction governments,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.367
and they're eating
chicken legs--oh no,

00:33:31.367 --> 00:33:33.900
turkey legs, and drinking,
and taking their shoes off.

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.500
It's in that same
kind of tradition.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.567
That's kind of astonishing.

00:33:37.567 --> 00:33:41.467
I went back last
year, that thing's gone.

00:33:41.467 --> 00:33:43.000
The rest of the
site is still there,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.200
but that part is gone.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.500
So someone raised a fuss.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.000
I mean, when, when
they brought Ben back,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
there was a whole
bunch of, like "Wow,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.500
this is a crazy idea."

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.600
But still Ben is--at
least, at least through last

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.200
year--I didn't check
the website last night,

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.667
and I don't shop
for Uncle Ben's,

00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:00.967
so I don't know if he's
still smiling at us in the,

00:34:00.967 --> 00:34:01.967
in the aisle ways.

00:34:01.967 --> 00:34:04.900
I suspect that he is.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:09.367
Now this is--corporate
makeovers are not limited

00:34:09.367 --> 00:34:11.867
just to the African
American experience.

00:34:11.867 --> 00:34:16.000
There is a campaign to
freshen Betty Crocker,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.100
the face of Betty Crocker,
and you see her through the

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.200
ages from 1927
until she ends up,

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:23.600
well, looking
like a wise Latina,

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.067
perhaps, in 1996.

00:34:26.067 --> 00:34:32.767
And when, when, when
this makeover came about,

00:34:32.767 --> 00:34:33.867
there was a lot
of discussion,

00:34:33.867 --> 00:34:34.867
like wow.

00:34:34.867 --> 00:34:36.867
I mean Betty
Crocker didn't say,

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.967
you know, what ethnic
identity she was supposed to

00:34:41.967 --> 00:34:42.967
have.

00:34:42.967 --> 00:34:43.967
She was just Betty Crocker.

00:34:43.967 --> 00:34:44.967
People think
that looks like,

00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:46.967
you know, a very
professional Latina.

00:34:46.967 --> 00:34:48.300
And heck if you look at
the demographics of this

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.800
country, that may be a
smart marketing trend,

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.667
going, going ahead a
couple of decades.

00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:54.700
So race is used
to sell things,

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.767
absolutely, and this is
just barely the tip of the

00:34:57.767 --> 00:34:58.767
iceberg.

00:34:58.767 --> 00:35:01.500
It's still being
used to sell things.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.900
Race is also used to suggest
progressive commitment to

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.900
equality.

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.667
University,
University of Wisconsin,

00:35:08.667 --> 00:35:12.167
year 2000, put out a
magazine for something like

00:35:12.167 --> 00:35:15.467
"Bulldog days," frankly,
for their version of it,

00:35:15.467 --> 00:35:16.467
"Badger days," I don't know.

00:35:16.467 --> 00:35:17.467
I'm making that up.

00:35:17.467 --> 00:35:19.800
But, but this was a
brochure they'd hand out,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.500
a magazine, talking about
all those great things that

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.367
Wisconsin,
University of Wisconsin,

00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:25.867
has and does.

00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:27.900
Exactly the kind of thing
you would expect from a

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.900
university.

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.600
I've absolutely no quarrel
with the content of the

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600
magazine.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:42.900
So that's the image, that's
the copy of the image,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.900
and if you look,
follow the--my mouse,

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.767
you see all of these
happy students at probably a

00:35:47.767 --> 00:35:49.000
football game.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.700
And then you see him, a
happy African American

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.100
student at a football game.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.667
That's, that's great.

00:35:56.667 --> 00:35:57.667
Here's the real image.

00:35:57.667 --> 00:36:00.367
He's not there.

00:36:03.267 --> 00:36:06.200
Now, you have to
go back ten years.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.300
Photoshop was
very new, okay.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.800
This was just
being rolled out.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.900
And the idea--now we--you've
grown up with--I mean,

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:15.900
everything is
Photoshopped, right?

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.900
It wasn't in 2000.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:23.900
This was a new technology,
and so they took--someone

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.900
who was looking at
the magazine said,

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.200
"You know, it's funny,
because the light's all

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.400
coming from a
certain angle here,

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:31.967
but it's coming from a
different angle over here.

00:36:31.967 --> 00:36:34.200
And, you know, it
just kind of--just the,

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.600
the biometrics
don't seem quite right,

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.900
 and someone slipped the
actual--this is what the

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:39.900
cover is.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.167
Now actually, I have a
friend I recruited from the

00:36:42.167 --> 00:36:44.200
University of Wisconsin,
Professor Blackhawk.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.400
Some of you may know him.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.067
He actually brought--and I
meant to bring it today,

00:36:48.067 --> 00:36:52.800
I forgot--one of his friends
at Wisconsin is still there,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.067
and gave to him to give
to me the actual copy.

00:36:56.067 --> 00:36:57.600
I mean, I actually
have one of these things.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.700
It's very cool.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:01.900
And then here's
the real image.

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:04.400
Now this young man, as it
turns out--and this was

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.000
taken at, at, like
a student bazaar.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.667
He was a very happy
University of Wisconsin

00:37:10.667 --> 00:37:11.667
student.

00:37:11.667 --> 00:37:13.100
He was a student leader.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.100
He was engaged in
all kinds of things.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.400
There's no doubt that he was
enthusiastic about being at

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.100
Wisconsin, but the fact
is, he wasn't there at that

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.100
moment.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:22.500
And you can see, they
actually turned the face in

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.800
the opposite direction,
did all of these different

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.800
things.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.667
Now Wisconsin is not trying
to say black folks aren't

00:37:31.667 --> 00:37:32.667
welcome.

00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:33.667
They're trying the opposite.

00:37:33.667 --> 00:37:37.300
"Look, there's a black
person at the football game!

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.300
We are a school
that--"--I mean,

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:39.900
and, and, it does not,
it's not a diverse school.

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.800
It's not a diverse state,
but they are really trying,

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.400
in this
publication at least,

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.700
symbolically, to try to
do something different.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.300
Race is used in
socially progressive ways,

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.700
even if
sometimes accidentally.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.900
This is a statue at North
Carolina A&amp;T in Greensboro,

00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.400
very close to Woolworth's
where the sit-in movement

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.267
began, and this is a
representation of the four

00:38:02.267 --> 00:38:04.500
men who are now
university heroes.

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.900
And if you go to
downtown Greensboro,

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.000
which was, after the
textile mills closed,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.767
there's nothing in
downtown Greensboro.

00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:14.600
My grandmother lives nearby,
so I was driving around and

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.300
come across--you can't see
here--February One Street.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.267
I mean, "That's a
weird name for a street,

00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:22.000
 and it turns out it's right
at the intersection of the

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.200
Woolworth's building.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.800
And Woolworth's building--oh
and there's placards in the,

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.600
in the ground, representing
the four men walking there,

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.367
and this is the, the
Woolworth's building,

00:38:32.367 --> 00:38:33.900
the site of the
Woolworth's building,

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.800
that the city fathers
wanted take--they wanted to

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:37.600
eliminate the history of the
Woolworth's building and the

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.067
sit-in for the longest time.

00:38:39.067 --> 00:38:41.700
It's an embarrassing part
of Greensboro's history.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.167
Preservationists said,
"You've got to save this

00:38:43.167 --> 00:38:45.567
thing," and then
people got together and,

00:38:45.567 --> 00:38:47.867
for years, were working on
building an international

00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:49.667
civil rights
center and museum.

00:38:49.667 --> 00:38:53.267
It took well over a decade
and they actually just

00:38:53.267 --> 00:38:59.467
opened up this February, on
the fiftieth anniversary of

00:38:59.467 --> 00:39:00.467
the sit-in.

00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:03.100
I haven't been to it yet,
but I'm looking forward to

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:04.100
going.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.100
But, so, what
does this matter?

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.767
How, how is race
being used here?

00:39:06.767 --> 00:39:09.167
There is nothing in
Greensboro any more.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.567
Southern cities, now
that industry has gone,

00:39:14.567 --> 00:39:17.467
are re--trying to rebuild
their downtown cores by

00:39:17.467 --> 00:39:20.000
creating heritage sites.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.500
A place of
social, and political,

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:25.000
and racial shame is now
being turned into--and the,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.800
the New York Times
review said it's a fantastic

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.400
museum--a place to
draw in tourist money.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:32.500
Birmingham is the same way.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.200
The, the attack dogs
that Bull Connor released,

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.200
had released, to go
after the student pro--the,

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.200
the, the
protestors, you know,

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.100
at the park,
there--it's now a memorial.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.900
You have the, the, the,
German shepherds frozen in a

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.900
very modernistic pose.

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.000
People travel throughout
the South in bus rides,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.000
sometimes
organized by universities,

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.567
to witness these places.

00:39:57.567 --> 00:39:59.000
There's a lot of
money at stake.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Race is being used.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.800
It's used in a conflated
way to honor and to sell a

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800
product.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.500
This is an image that
needs no narration.

00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:11.200
You know, it's King at
the "I have a--"--March on

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.200
Washington.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:18.300
An advertisement,
"Before you can inspire,

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:21.500
before you can touch,
you must first connect."

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:27.000
It's by Alcatel, a wireless
phone service in 2001,

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.800
and a suggestion.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.300
You know, even whether
it's Photoshopped or just a,

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.800
you know, created image,
that if only King had a good

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.800
cell phone service, we'd
have something different.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.167
Now you all grew
up after, I guess,

00:40:41.167 --> 00:40:43.967
"Forrest Gump" was out, but
this was very controversial

00:40:43.967 --> 00:40:46.500
when it came out, very
popular but controversial,

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.200
with historians, like
"What are you doing,

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.100
you know, playing around
fast and loose with history

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:51.700
like this?"

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.567
As Forrest Gump--this was,
they leave characters all

00:40:53.567 --> 00:40:58.000
over the place, and
wondering what--how history

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.700
would have been
different, you know,

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:06.100
in this case, had King
had a different product,

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.367
and just as
Forrest Gump was,

00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:08.867
you know, there at
all these places,

00:41:08.867 --> 00:41:12.100
you know, changing
history quite by accident.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.100
Americans are
really bad historians,

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.400
so professional historians
get anxious when they see

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.800
something like this, even
though it may be clever.

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.500
Now King is certainly
a political football,

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.067
whether it's the California
Civil Rights Initiative or,

00:41:25.067 --> 00:41:26.500
you know,
progressives, conservatives,

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.500
they all use King.

00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:31.200
In the Oakland school
district--goodness,

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.700
about, I want to say
seven or eight years ago

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.900
now--there was a major
debate about Ebonics.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.867
The question is, Ebonics,
would it be recognized as a

00:41:39.867 --> 00:41:44.700
form of American dialect,
and if it was--English

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:49.600
dialect, and if it
was--there would be actual

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.700
institutional support for
helping these kids who speak

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.300
Ebonics, nonstandard
American English,

00:41:58.167 --> 00:42:00.400
to help them with extra
support and tutoring,

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.367
you know, in
Ebonics vernacular,

00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:05.200
as a way to be--eventually
mainstream them.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.967
Clear
representation of King,

00:42:09.967 --> 00:42:12.000
you know, "I has a
dream," that would be,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.800
you know, King if he
were speaking in Ebonics.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.267
And the text is very
small down here and it says,

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:17.267
"Does this bother you?"

00:42:17.267 --> 00:42:19.500
(This is from,
[clears throat] excuse me,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.500
October '98.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.500
I just have the
date here, I'm sorry,

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.300
'98.) "Does this bother you?

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:24.400
It should.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.300
We spent over four hundred
years fighting for the right

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.500
to have a voice.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:29.000
Is this how we'll use it?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.900
More importantly, is this
how we'll teach our children

00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.000
to use it?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.300
If we expect more of them,
we must not throw our hands

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.967
in the air and agree with
those who say our children

00:42:35.967 --> 00:42:37.567
cannot be taught.

00:42:37.567 --> 00:42:39.167
By now you've probably
heard about Ebonics,

00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:42.267
aka, aka black English, and
if you think it's become a

00:42:42.267 --> 00:42:44.000
controversy because white
America doesn't want us

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.400
messing with their
precious language,

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:46.400
don't.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.200
White America couldn't care
less what we do to segregate

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.300
ourselves.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.800
The fact is, language is
power and we can't take that

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.800
power away from our
children with Ebonics.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.200
Would Dr.
Martin Luther King,

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.000
Malcolm X and all the
others who paid the price of

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.400
obtaining our voice with
the currency of their lives

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.400
embrace this?

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.900
If you haven't used
your voice lately,

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.200
consider this
an invitation."

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.500
African Americans gathering
together to purchase this

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.467
advertisement, railing
against other African

00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:10.900
Americans and
blacks and whites,

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:13.067
of course, on both
sides of the line,

00:43:13.067 --> 00:43:17.500
about who can speak for the
race and what that race is

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.500
going to say.

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:21.600
It's a
contemporary history, race,

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.100
this is a satellite image
of Katrina washing ashore.

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.200
Now there's a lot to be
said about race and Katrina.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.400
I don't have
time to do that,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:36.400
but I want to show you two
images from the moment and

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:43.167
talk about the way that
race factored into it.

00:43:43.167 --> 00:43:44.700
We all know, of
course, you go to,

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.000
you know, Yahoo!

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.100
web pages, you know,
any sort of web pages for

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.300
breaking news, and they
have a scroll of pictures,

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.967
and here's two hundred
pictures from a certain

00:43:51.967 --> 00:43:53.200
event and you can
hit the next one,

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.867
and the next one,
and the next one.

00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:58.800
And they all have a
little bit of script,

00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.800
very short description.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:00.800
Now there are journalistic
practices about what the

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.467
photojournalist is
supposed to say,

00:44:02.467 --> 00:44:05.167
the photographer, to
describe what he or she is

00:44:05.167 --> 00:44:06.800
seeing.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.167
There are standards about
what constitutes finding

00:44:10.167 --> 00:44:14.300
something, what constitutes
stealing something or

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.400
looting something.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.800
So I don't know the
facts of these two pictures,

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.467
about what the, the
photographer saw,

00:44:22.467 --> 00:44:26.800
but this image runs, and
it shows two white people

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:29.667
having "found"
food in Katrina.

00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:31.667
And, you know, there's
carrying bags like orange

00:44:31.667 --> 00:44:32.800
juice or groceries,
something like that,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.867
in that bag,
floating along the way.

00:44:34.867 --> 00:44:38.067
Two people who found food.

00:44:38.067 --> 00:44:40.267
The next image,
as it happened,

00:44:40.267 --> 00:44:44.867
was this one, a citizen
who, who "looted" a store,

00:44:44.867 --> 00:44:51.400
carrying a, a, a twelve pack
or twenty pack of Pepsi,

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.600
and who knows
what in the bag.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.600
The fact is, he may
have looted a store.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.900
The fact is, they may
have found the food.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:01.267
I'm not
disputing this, okay?

00:45:01.267 --> 00:45:04.300
I'm not engaging it, but the
pictures ran right next to

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:10.567
each other, and we are all
so hardwired to presume that

00:45:10.567 --> 00:45:12.900
the person
writing this sentence,

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.200
or the editor
putting together,

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.767
has tripped over a
racial fault line,

00:45:18.767 --> 00:45:22.000
that they can't see anything
but a criminal in this

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.967
image, and a citizen
in the previous one.

00:45:24.967 --> 00:45:26.767
And this was part
of the rhetoric of,

00:45:26.767 --> 00:45:28.900
of Katrina, certainly in the
way it was reported in the

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:30.200
news.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:32.367
Black and brown people
are talked about refugees,

00:45:32.367 --> 00:45:33.500
although they were citizens.

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:38.767
But a reason I point to this
is to talk about the way

00:45:38.767 --> 00:45:43.700
that we are consumed
with thinking about race,

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:46.367
to a point that we
become quite blinded by it.

00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:48.500
I don't have the
time for it right now,

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.100
but let me
encourage you to go to,

00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:53.900
go to YouTube and
put in "Mike Myers,

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:56.200
Katrina and Kanye West,"
or just "Katrina and Kanye

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.400
West," and you'll see more
of what I'm talking about:

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.200
race being used to
heighten our emotions,

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.600
used in ways that either are
clarifying or destructive,

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.700
depending on
your point of view.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.500
Race is very much
past and present.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.300
Even in our
"post-racial" age,

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.700
we have controversies like
this one in the New York

00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:24.700
Post: two cops having
blown apart a chimpanzee,

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.400
"We'll have to find someone
else to write that next

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.067
stimulus bill."

00:46:29.067 --> 00:46:32.100
The artist saying, "I had
no racist intent at all.

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.000
It was just, you know, it
was an attempt at humor,

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.200
talking about, you know,
the bill was so crazy,

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.800
it must have been
monkeys sitting in a room."

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.000
You know, there's a phrase
about--where you put a

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000
hundred monkeys in a
room, you get Shakespeare

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
eventually that--working
typewriters--but,

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.700
but that this is what
he was going after.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.700
He may have been
absolutely honest,

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:52.200
but the way that
this was perceived,

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.767
with the long history of
connections between African

00:46:54.767 --> 00:46:59.000
Americans and apes, and the
fact the president is behind

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.600
signing stimulus bills, that
the--and there's a history

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:07.900
of New York police,
cops, shooting unarmed black

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:11.667
citizens, or
attacking in other ways,

00:47:11.667 --> 00:47:15.200
that somebody in the
editorial process in the New

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:16.900
York Post missed
the boat entirely.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.500
Did not see that this
might have been wildly

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.767
misinterpreted if the
artist had no racist intent.

00:47:21.767 --> 00:47:28.767
There was no confusion
about the intent here.

00:47:28.767 --> 00:47:30.667
Emails sent out by the
mayor of Las Alamedas,

00:47:30.667 --> 00:47:33.200
California,
talking about, you know,

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.400
now that Obama's elected,
we're going to have a

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.000
watermelon patch on the
White House front lawn.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.167
What does this
image accomplish,

00:47:41.167 --> 00:47:43.500
aside from the mayor
apologizing and stepping

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.500
down?

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.200
You know, is it satire?

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.767
Sure, it's satire, but is it
also a Rorschach test of how

00:47:52.767 --> 00:47:54.100
you have someone
like, looking like,

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.300
Barack Obama taking office,
and people don't know what

00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.300
to make of it,
don't know what to do?

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.200
Now we talked
about in this course,

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.700
at the very
beginning, racial symbolism,

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.000
you know, the money we
carry in our pocket.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
You know, and again,
it's not showing up well,

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
but, you know, John C.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.967
Calhoun in the corner there.

00:48:15.967 --> 00:48:19.400
Let's not believe that
this is past history.

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:22.067
Let us recognize the
Republican Women's Group in

00:48:22.067 --> 00:48:24.300
I--Inland, California sent
this out in the newsletter,

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:27.500
of Obama bucks.

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:31.100
He's got a
watermelon, the Kool-Aid,

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.100
a bunch of ribs and KFC.

00:48:35.067 --> 00:48:37.600
This is our current
state of affairs.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.100
Race is used in, in
the American landscape,

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:48.100
in our "post-racial" age, to
get us through circumstances

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:51.900
that we don't want to
call them as being say

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:55.500
class-driven, or
driven by gender anxiety,

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:57.300
or driven by
political anxiety.

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.967
Oh, it's all going to
be coded in racial ways.

00:48:59.967 --> 00:49:01.667
But because, you know, we
don't want to be seen as

00:49:01.667 --> 00:49:03.100
racist, we can't
talk about it.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.767
We can show it, but we
can't talk about it.

00:49:05.767 --> 00:49:06.967
So I really
want to end then,

00:49:06.967 --> 00:49:09.600
and just bear with
me a couple minutes,

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.300
we've gone through
this entire course

00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.200
thinking--sharing a
history of social,

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.500
political, intellectual,
cultural history,

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:18.000
of the different ways
citizenship has been

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.100
wrestled over, the
way race has been used.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.467
The TAs, I hope you will
actually join me in giving,

00:49:23.467 --> 00:49:25.300
giving them a round of
applause for helping us

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:27.967
through this way and through
these incredibly interesting

00:49:27.967 --> 00:49:29.967
and, and, and
vexed conversations.

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:30.967
Congratulations.

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:36.200
Thank you so
much for your help.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.067
Now I always do something
a little bit unusual here.

00:49:39.067 --> 00:49:40.667
Are--Freshmen, are
there freshmen here?

00:49:40.667 --> 00:49:43.400
Raise your hands.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.767
Stand up, please.

00:49:44.767 --> 00:49:47.600
Yes, stand up.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.500
Stand up for
goodness' sakes.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.100
I'm out of time, I
don't--I've got to be quick

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:52.567
about this thing.

00:49:52.567 --> 00:49:54.967
This is one of your last
classes of freshmen year,

00:49:54.967 --> 00:49:56.667
and I hope that your
experience here has been

00:49:56.667 --> 00:50:00.300
exciting and wonderful, and
I also hope that people will

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.867
join me in congratulating
you in navigating

00:50:02.867 --> 00:50:05.667
which--what has been a
horrible year at Yale for

00:50:05.667 --> 00:50:07.100
all these reasons we know.

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.400
And I hope that you will
leave this year armed to

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.900
become a better
citizen at Yale.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.300
So
congratulations, freshmen.

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:18.200
Professor Jonathan
Holloway: Sit down now.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.000
Seniors here?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.467
Stand up.

00:50:21.467 --> 00:50:24.200
Stand up.

00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.467
I know, because I
walked over with Julia.

00:50:25.467 --> 00:50:27.167
This is one of your
last classes at Yale.

00:50:27.167 --> 00:50:28.167
You're going to get a lot of
people congratulating you.

00:50:28.167 --> 00:50:31.167
I'm not
congratulating you at all.

00:50:31.167 --> 00:50:35.000
A lot of people are going to
be telling you how great and

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.100
wonderful you are.

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.467
Oh, in the back, can you
step over one foot because

00:50:39.467 --> 00:50:42.067
you're blocking the
camera right there.

00:50:42.067 --> 00:50:43.067
There we go.

00:50:43.067 --> 00:50:44.067
People are going to tell
you how wonderful you are,

00:50:44.067 --> 00:50:46.567
and you are wonderful, but
the fact of the matter is,

00:50:46.567 --> 00:50:47.900
you now have a
responsibility when you

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.300
leave here, I think.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:50.667
You may disagree
with everything I said.

00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:52.800
That is actually
quite fine with me,

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.700
but I hope that you
will engage what I said,

00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:56.167
and what the TAs have
said, and what you said in

00:50:56.167 --> 00:50:58.367
section, that you will
understand it's incumbent

00:50:58.367 --> 00:51:01.300
upon you to make
this a better place,

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.600
to make it, in
Barack Obama's word,

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.400
a more perf--perfect union.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.900
And you've been
armed with the history,

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:08.400
even if you
disagree with it,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.600
a history that I hope will
make you think and challenge

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.000
others when they start
spouting off in the most

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.700
unpredictable, or
maybe predictable,

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:16.700
ways.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.467
So I want to congratulate
you personally for being

00:51:20.467 --> 00:51:22.200
here, sticking through
it, getting through Yale,

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:26.400
and I hope everyone else
will congratulate you as

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:27.400
well.

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.400
Congratulations.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:29.400
Professor Jonathan
Holloway: Sophomore,

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:34.000
juniors, I ain't got
nothing for you guys.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.467
[Students laugh] So I really
raise the closing question,

00:51:37.467 --> 00:51:39.300
the question that animates
this lecture: how is race

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.300
used?

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:41.600
And I simply
want to ask you,

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:42.600
how will you use it?

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.900
Thank you very much.

00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.900
Thank you.

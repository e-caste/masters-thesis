00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.627
Professor Paul Bloom:
What we've been talking about

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:19.964
so far in the course are human
universals, what everybody

00:00:19.964 --> 00:00:22.553
shares.
So, we've been talking about

00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:25.660
language, about rationality,
about perception,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.512
about the emotions,
about universals of

00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:32.790
development, and we've been
talking about what people share.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.824
But honestly,
what a lot of us are very

00:00:35.824 --> 00:00:40.057
interested in is why we're
different and the nature of

00:00:40.057 --> 00:00:44.130
these differences and the
explanation for them.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.760
And that's what we'll turn to
today.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.056
So first, we'll discuss how are
people different,

00:00:49.056 --> 00:00:52.696
different theories about what
makes you different in a

00:00:52.696 --> 00:00:56.680
psychological way from the
person sitting next to you,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.663
and then we'll review different
theories about why people are

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:04.226
different.
And this is the class which is

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:09.150
going to bother the most people.
It's not dualism.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.605
It's not evolution.
It's this because the

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.292
scientific findings on human
psychological differences are,

00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:19.090
to many of us,
shocking and unbelievable.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.160
And I will just try to persuade
you to take them seriously.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.070
Okay.
So, how are people different?

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.781
Well, there's all sorts of ways.
Your sexual identity--It is at

00:01:31.781 --> 00:01:37.161
the core of your being for
almost all of us whether you're

00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.390
male or female.
How we refer to you in

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.147
language, what pronoun we use,
is indexed on how we--on

00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:48.113
your--on how--whether you're
male or female and related to

00:01:48.113 --> 00:01:52.010
that though imperfectly is your
sexual orientation,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.272
who you're attracted to.
The question of why some of us

00:01:55.272 --> 00:01:58.099
think of ourselves as males and
others as females,

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.271
and the question of why some of
us would ideally want to have

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:03.767
sex with males,
others with females,

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:07.522
others with both,
and then a few others who have

00:02:07.522 --> 00:02:11.592
harder to define desires,
is such a good question that

00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:15.518
we're going to talk about it
after spring break while all the

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:19.510
sexual desire has been spent and
you could focus on [laughter]

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.371
on a scientific discussion of
this--not that I recommend you

00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:27.060
do that on spring break.
How happy are you?

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.639
This is also such a good topic
it's going to get its own class.

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.766
The very last class of the
semester is devoted to happiness

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:39.039
and the question of what makes
people happy,

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.710
what makes people unhappy,
and what makes people differ in

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.519
their happiness.
If I asked you to rank how

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.451
happy you are from a scale of 1
to 10, the numbers would differ

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:52.168
across this room.
And there's different theories

00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:54.480
as to why.
Your success and failure in

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.842
life--This is somewhat
interesting because you could

00:02:57.842 --> 00:03:00.810
study this in more or less
objective ways.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.222
We don't have to ask people.
We could look at your

00:03:03.222 --> 00:03:04.953
relationships,
how they begin,

00:03:04.953 --> 00:03:07.280
how they end,
your job satisfaction.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.610
We could look at your criminal
records.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.610
Some of you are going to see
time.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.155
Most will not.
Some of you will get into

00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:17.409
little troubles all through your
life.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.197
Some of you already have seen
the inside of a police station,

00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:25.346
possibly a lineup.
Others couldn't go near such a

00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:28.220
thing.
What determines that?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.089
And at the root of all human
differences are two main

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:37.656
factors.
And so, I want to talk about

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:39.170
the two main interesting
factors.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.530
One is personality.
The other is intelligence.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.826
And this is what--These are the
differences I'll talk about

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:50.520
today first from the standpoint
of how do we characterize them,

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.702
how do we explain them,
and then from the standpoint of

00:03:53.702 --> 00:03:56.590
why these differences exist in
the first place.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.536
One way to characterize
personality is in terms of

00:04:04.536 --> 00:04:08.805
people's style with dealing
with--in dealing with the world

00:04:08.805 --> 00:04:13.001
and particularly their style
with dealing--in dealing with

00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.227
other people.
So, you take a simple character

00:04:16.227 --> 00:04:20.000
you know of and you could talk
about that person's personality.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.512
You could talk about it in
terms of being impulsive,

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:25.509
irresponsible,
sometimes lazy,

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.810
good-hearted.
You could compare that person's

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.590
personality with other people's
personalities such as my

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.340
colleague who gave a talk last
class.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.846
He's wonderful.
He's responsible and reliable

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:42.410
and very kind [laughter]
and different from Homer.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.629
And so, this difference is a
difference in personality.

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.945
Now, when we talk about
personality we're talking about

00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:52.440
something else as well.
We're talking about a stable

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.819
trait across situations and
time.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.818
So, if all of a sudden the
person next to you kind of

00:04:57.818 --> 00:05:00.762
smacks you in the head,
you might be angry but we

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:04.547
wouldn't call that "personality"
because that's something that's

00:05:04.547 --> 00:05:07.501
a result of a situation.
We'd all feel that way in that

00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:10.395
situation.
It's "personality" if you walk

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:14.000
around all the time angry.
That'd be a stable trait.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.670
That'd be something you carry
around with you and that's what

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.474
we mean by personality.
Now, how do we scientifically

00:05:21.474 --> 00:05:24.690
characterize differences in
personality?

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.437
And it's a deep question.
There's been a lot of attempts

00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:30.346
to do so.
Any assessment has--Any good

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:34.060
assessment has to satisfy two
conditions.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.552
And these are terms which are
going to show up all over

00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:41.496
psychological research but it's
particularly relevant for this

00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:45.399
sort of measure.
One is "reliability."

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:51.350
Reliability means there is not
measurement error.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.146
And one crude way to think
about reliability is,

00:05:55.146 --> 00:05:59.830
a test is reliable if you test
the same person at different

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.899
times and you get the same
result.

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:06.216
My bathroom scale is reliable
if whenever I stand on it,

00:06:06.216 --> 00:06:08.810
it gives me more or less the
same number.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.689
It's not reliable if it's off
by ten pounds in the course of a

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.014
day.
Similarly, if I give you a

00:06:16.014 --> 00:06:19.917
personality test now and it says
that you're anxious and

00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:22.587
defensive,
well--and then give it to you

00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:25.600
tomorrow and it says you're calm
and open minded,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.278
it's not a reliable test.
So, reliable is something you

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:32.016
could trust over time.
"Validity" is something

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:35.462
different.
Validity is that your test

00:06:35.462 --> 00:06:39.589
measures what it's supposed to
measure.

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:42.600
So, validity means it's sort of
a good test.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.527
Forget about how reliable it is.
Does it tap what you're

00:06:45.527 --> 00:06:47.395
interested in?
So, for example,

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:50.879
suppose I determine your
intelligence by the date of your

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:53.416
birth.
I figure out what day you were

00:06:53.416 --> 00:06:57.305
born and I have a theory that,
from that, predicts how smart

00:06:57.305 --> 00:06:59.236
you are.
That's my intelligence test,

00:06:59.236 --> 00:07:02.024
the date of your birth.
Maybe people born in January

00:07:02.024 --> 00:07:04.968
are the dumbest,
people born in December are the

00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:08.692
smartest.
Is that--I was born on

00:07:08.692 --> 00:07:11.491
Christmas Eve.
[laughter]

00:07:11.491 --> 00:07:14.957
Is that a reliable test?
Yes, it's a wonderfully

00:07:14.957 --> 00:07:16.970
reliable test.
I'll test you today;

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.760
I'll test you tomorrow;
I'll test you next year;

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.680
I'll test you the day you die;
I'll get the same IQ score.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.600
Is it a valid test?
It's a joke.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.170
It's absolutely not a valid
test.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.939
It has nothing to do with
intelligence.

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:30.670
But you noticed these are two
different things.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:35.172
Something can be reliable but
not valid and something can be

00:07:35.172 --> 00:07:39.690
valid and not reliable.
Now, there are no shortage of

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:44.841
personality tests.
You could get them all over the

00:07:44.841 --> 00:07:49.569
place including on the web.
So, I took one recently.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:54.100
I took "which super hero are
you?"

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.100
[laughter]
And it's a series of questions

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.000
determining what super hero you
are.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.639
You could take this yourself if
you want to.

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:03.906
The same web page,
by the way, offers you a test

00:08:03.906 --> 00:08:07.730
in whether you're "hot" or not.
We'll discuss that later.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.837
And when I did this [laughter]
it told me I was Batman

00:08:11.837 --> 00:08:14.240
[laughter]
and "you are dark,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.101
love gadgets,
and have vowed to help the

00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:18.439
innocent not suffer the pain you
have endured."

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:22.131
Now, the honest-- [laughter]
Now, to be honest though,

00:08:22.131 --> 00:08:24.500
it's neither reliable nor
valid.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.471
When I first did the test I
came up as "The Incredible

00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:30.011
Hulk."
I then changed my answers a bit

00:08:30.011 --> 00:08:32.291
and was "Wonder Woman."
[laughter]

00:08:32.291 --> 00:08:34.343
And finally,
out of frustration,

00:08:34.343 --> 00:08:38.049
I carefully tailored my answers
so I would be Batman.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:42.221
But the fact that I can do
that, well, raises questions

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:47.009
about both the reliability of
this measure and its validity.

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:49.860
Here is an example – a real
world example.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:54.479
This is, in black and white
form, a version of the Rorschach

00:08:54.479 --> 00:08:57.220
test, the Rorschach inkblot
test.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.690
How many people have heard of
the Rorschach test?

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.533
Okay.
Is there anybody here who has

00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:06.927
actually, in any sort of
situation, taken a Rorschach

00:09:06.927 --> 00:09:09.107
test?
Some people scattered in the

00:09:09.107 --> 00:09:12.636
room have taken them.
It was originally used only for

00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:16.370
psychiatric cases but then
became extremely common.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.821
About eighty percent of
clinical psychologists claim to

00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:24.778
use it and most graduate
programs in the American

00:09:24.778 --> 00:09:29.559
Psychological Association who
are accredited teach it.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:34.019
Catholic seminaries use it for
people who want to join the

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:37.817
seminary.
It was invented by a guy named

00:09:37.817 --> 00:09:42.368
Herman Rorschach.
He devoted his entire life to

00:09:42.368 --> 00:09:45.804
the inkblot test.
His nickname when he was a

00:09:45.804 --> 00:09:49.279
teenager – I am not kidding
you – was "Inkblot."

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:52.035
[laughter]
And the idea is by looking at

00:09:52.035 --> 00:09:56.416
these inkblots and then seeing
what somebody says you get great

00:09:56.416 --> 00:09:59.950
insights into the nature of
their personality,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.480
into what they are.
Anybody want to try it?

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.200
Come on.
Yes.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.137
What do you see?
Student:

00:10:11.137 --> 00:10:13.970
I see two people holding hands
pressed together.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.305
Professor Paul Bloom:
Two people holding hands pressed

00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:16.399
together.
Very good.

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:18.630
Anybody have a different
reading?

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.070
Yes, in back.
Yes.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.769
Yes.
Student: Dancing bears.

00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:24.310
Professor Paul Bloom:
Dancing bears.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:28.870
Okay.
Good.[laughter] Good.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.491
Okay.
I got to write your name down--

00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:33.780
[laughs][laughter]
report you to health-- No.

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.880
Dancing bears, very good.
Anybody else?

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.360
One other.
Yes.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.960
Student:
A man in a ski mask.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.320
Professor Paul Bloom: A
man in a ski mask.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.773
Well, it turns out that there
are right answers and wrong

00:10:46.773 --> 00:10:51.398
answers to the Rorschach test.
According to the test,

00:10:51.398 --> 00:10:54.003
and this is from a real
Rorschach test,

00:10:54.003 --> 00:10:57.636
"it is important to see the
blot as two human figures,

00:10:57.636 --> 00:11:01.320
usually females or clowns."
Good work over there.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.678
"If you don't,
it's seen as a sign you have

00:11:03.678 --> 00:11:06.159
problems relating to people."
[laughter]

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:10.301
If you want to go for "a cave
entrance" or "butterfly" or

00:11:10.301 --> 00:11:13.756
"vagina," that's also okay.
[laughter]

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:20.059
Now, the Rorschach test is
transcendently useless.

00:11:20.059 --> 00:11:26.350
It has been studied and
explored and it is as useless as

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.350
throwing dice.
It is as useless as tea leaves.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.694
Nonetheless,
people love it and it's used

00:11:33.694 --> 00:11:37.714
all over the place.
It is used for example in child

00:11:37.714 --> 00:11:40.569
custody cases.
If you have broken up with your

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:43.748
partner and you guys are
quarreling over who gets to keep

00:11:43.748 --> 00:11:46.261
the kids,
you might find yourself in a

00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:49.182
shrink's office looking at this.
And in fact,

00:11:49.182 --> 00:11:51.470
this is why they end up on the
web.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:54.535
There are services.
There are people who have been

00:11:54.535 --> 00:11:57.199
kind enough to put on the web
these inkblots,

00:11:57.199 --> 00:11:59.559
including the right answers to
them.

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:02.430
But they are worthless as
psychological measures.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:06.330
Can we do better?
Well, we probably can.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.310
Gordon Allport did a study
where he went through the

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:14.915
dictionary and took all of the
traits that he believed to be

00:12:14.915 --> 00:12:19.909
related to personality and he
got eighteen thousand of them.

00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:23.842
But what was interesting was
they weren't necessarily

00:12:23.842 --> 00:12:28.190
independent traits.
So, the traits like "friendly,

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.883
sociable, welcoming,
warm-hearted" seemed to all tap

00:12:32.883 --> 00:12:36.440
the same thing.
So, Cattell and many others

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.100
tried to narrow it down,
tried to ask the question,

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:44.490
"In how many ways are people's
personalities different from one

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.867
another?"
How many parameters of

00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:51.362
difference do you need?
How many numbers can I give you

00:12:51.362 --> 00:12:56.600
that would narrow you in and say
what personality you are?

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.340
One approach was from Eysenck,
who claimed there were just

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.007
two.
You could be somewhere on the

00:13:04.007 --> 00:13:06.398
scale of
introverted-extroverted,

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:10.360
and somewhere on the scale of
neurotic and stable.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.406
And since there's basically two
types of traits with two

00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:16.064
settings for each,
there are basically four types

00:13:16.064 --> 00:13:18.963
of people.
Later on he added another trait

00:13:18.963 --> 00:13:21.771
which he described as
"psychoticism versus

00:13:21.771 --> 00:13:25.948
non-psychoticism" that crudely
meant whether you're aggressive

00:13:25.948 --> 00:13:29.963
or empathetic.
And then you have three traits

00:13:29.963 --> 00:13:35.120
with two settings each giving
you eight types of people.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:39.539
Later on Cattell dropped it
down into sixteen factors.

00:13:39.539 --> 00:13:43.820
So, these sixteen personality
factors are sixteen ways people

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.701
would differ.
And so, if I asked you to

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:50.543
describe your roommate along
these sixteen dimensions,

00:13:50.543 --> 00:13:54.067
you should be able to do so.
More recently,

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:58.996
people have come to the
conclusion that two or three is

00:13:58.996 --> 00:14:02.830
too few, but sixteen might be
too many.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:08.988
And there's a psychological
consensus on what's been known

00:14:08.988 --> 00:14:13.872
as "The Big Five."
And "The Big Five" personality

00:14:13.872 --> 00:14:18.227
factors are these,
and what this means is when we

00:14:18.227 --> 00:14:22.220
talk about each other and use
adjectives,

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.784
the claim is we could do so in
thousands of different ways,

00:14:25.784 --> 00:14:28.858
but deep down we're talking
about one of these five

00:14:28.858 --> 00:14:31.212
dimensions.
This means that when a

00:14:31.212 --> 00:14:34.730
psychological test measures
something about somebody,

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.536
about their personality,
if it's a good test it's

00:14:37.536 --> 00:14:39.700
measuring one of these five
things.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.470
And it means that,
as people interacting with one

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.414
another in the world,
these are the five things that

00:14:45.414 --> 00:14:50.688
we're interested in.
So, one of them is "neurotic

00:14:50.688 --> 00:14:56.079
versus stable."
Is somebody sort of nutty and

00:14:56.079 --> 00:15:01.659
worrying or are they calm?
"Extrovert versus introvert."

00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:06.710
"Open to experience versus
closed to experience."

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.554
"Agreeable," which is
courteous, friendly versus non

00:15:10.554 --> 00:15:12.590
agreeable, rude,
selfish.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:17.563
And "conscientious versus not
conscientious," careful versus

00:15:17.563 --> 00:15:21.019
careless, reliable versus
undependable.

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:27.186
A good way to think about these
things is in terms of the word

00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:31.379
"ocean," o-c-e-a-n.
The first letter captures

00:15:31.379 --> 00:15:34.774
openness, conscientiousness,
extroversion,

00:15:34.774 --> 00:15:37.590
agreeableness,
and neuroticism.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:41.901
And the claim is those are the
four--the five fundamental ways

00:15:41.901 --> 00:15:44.870
in which people differ from one
another.

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.929
Well, why should we believe
this?

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:49.399
Why should we take this theory
seriously?

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:51.870
Well, there's actually some
evidence for it.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:16:01.587
It seems to have some
reliability in that it's stable

00:16:01.587 --> 00:16:05.498
over time.
So, if you test people over

00:16:05.498 --> 00:16:08.465
years--If I test your
personality now on the five

00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:11.927
traits and test you five years
from now, it will not have

00:16:11.927 --> 00:16:15.201
changed much.
And once you pass the age of

00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:19.935
thirty, it's very stable indeed.
If you think about your parents

00:16:19.935 --> 00:16:24.024
and then give Mom and Dad a
mental test on where they stand

00:16:24.024 --> 00:16:27.681
on each of the five traits,
ten years from now Mom and Dad

00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:31.460
will still be there.
It also seems to get agreement

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.736
across multiple observers.
So, if I ask for each of their

00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:42.051
five traits--If I ask your
roommate what he or she thinks

00:16:42.051 --> 00:16:45.024
of you,
then I ask your professor what

00:16:45.024 --> 00:16:49.275
he or she thinks of you and your
mom what he or--what she thinks

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:50.788
of you,
[laughter]

00:16:50.788 --> 00:16:55.150
how would--back to gender--How
would they match up?

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:59.486
They tend to overlap a lot.
You walk around and you

00:16:59.486 --> 00:17:02.675
leave--and your personality
leaves a trail in the minds of

00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:05.738
people around you.
And this trail is characterized

00:17:05.738 --> 00:17:07.869
in terms of these five
dimensions.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:13.319
Finally, it seems to
be--predict real-world behavior.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.522
If this didn't have anything to
do with the real world,

00:17:16.522 --> 00:17:19.250
you wouldn't be very happy
calling it valid,

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.849
you wouldn't take it seriously
as a test, but it does.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.648
So, conscientiousness--how you
score on a conscientious scale,

00:17:25.648 --> 00:17:28.700
relates to how faithful you are
to your spouse.

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:33.269
How openness--open you are on a
psychological personality test

00:17:33.269 --> 00:17:37.089
relates to how likely you are to
change your job.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:41.271
"Extroverts" look people in the
eye more and have more sexual

00:17:41.271 --> 00:17:43.920
partners because they're
extroverts.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.672
So, these are real scales.
The "Batman,

00:17:46.672 --> 00:17:50.046
Hulk, Wonder Woman" doesn't
correspond to anything in the

00:17:50.046 --> 00:17:52.541
real world,
but where you stand on each of

00:17:52.541 --> 00:17:55.130
these five dimensions does seem
to capture it.

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.565
As an example of the agreement,
by the way, somebody did a

00:17:59.565 --> 00:18:03.533
study of several of the
characters on the television

00:18:03.533 --> 00:18:08.435
show "The Simpsons" because they
wanted to find characters which

00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:12.518
everybody knew.
And they had thirteen subjects

00:18:12.518 --> 00:18:17.660
judge these Simpson characters
on each of the five dimensions.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:20.622
These is "openness,
neuroticism,

00:18:20.622 --> 00:18:24.826
conscientiousness,
and extroversion" and they

00:18:24.826 --> 00:18:29.669
found considerable agreement.
And this isn't actually--What

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:32.000
I've covered up is the
"agreeableness."

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.812
So, for those of you who have
never seen the television show,

00:18:35.812 --> 00:18:38.099
this is all going to be
confusing,

00:18:38.099 --> 00:18:42.206
but those of you who have,
can you guess which characters

00:18:42.206 --> 00:18:46.600
would be particularly agreeable?
Anybody guess.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.625
Yeah.
Student: Flanders

00:18:48.625 --> 00:18:49.820
Professor Paul Bloom:
Flanders.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.762
You are right.
The most agreeable people are

00:18:53.762 --> 00:18:58.329
Flanders and Marge.
Who would not so agreeable?

00:18:58.329 --> 00:19:02.065
Student:
Krusty Professor Paul

00:19:02.065 --> 00:19:05.991
Bloom: Krusty is
actually--Krusty is a

00:19:05.991 --> 00:19:09.247
complicated case [laughter]
but Mr.

00:19:09.247 --> 00:19:14.671
Burns--but also--Where is he?
Oh, he's not--Nelson,

00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:18.339
where's Nelson?
Anyway, there's Nelson.

00:19:18.339 --> 00:19:23.885
You get strong consensus that
Ned Flanders and Marge Simpson

00:19:23.885 --> 00:19:27.834
are highly agreeable people,
6.27 and 5.46,

00:19:27.834 --> 00:19:31.970
while Mr.
Burns and Nelson are very low.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.905
Nelson's the little kid that
when trouble happens he goes,

00:19:34.905 --> 00:19:37.379
"Ha ha."
And that's a psychological sign

00:19:37.379 --> 00:19:39.759
for low agreeability.
[laughter] Okay.

00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:42.823
That's all I want to say at
this point about personality and

00:19:42.823 --> 00:19:45.411
how we measure it and,
again, we're going to get back

00:19:45.411 --> 00:19:48.049
to it later when we talk about
differences in personality.

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:51.589
Now, I want to deal with the
second big difference.

00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:53.880
The second big difference is
intelligence.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.840
Now, how do you define
intelligence?

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.939
There's no easy definition.
Like personality,

00:19:59.939 --> 00:20:02.589
it's kind of difficult to get
your fingers on what we're

00:20:02.589 --> 00:20:05.735
talking about here.
In one survey they asked 1,000

00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:09.780
experts to define intelligence.
And some answers showed up over

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.393
and over again.
So, just about everybody said

00:20:12.393 --> 00:20:15.683
intelligence involves abstract
reasoning, problem solving,

00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:18.049
and the capacity to acquire
knowledge.

00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:21.539
That's at the core of being
smart.

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:25.378
Other people mentioned things
like memory, mental speed,

00:20:25.378 --> 00:20:27.960
language, math,
mental speed again,

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.319
knowledge, and creativity also
as hallmarks for intelligence.

00:20:33.319 --> 00:20:37.133
And again, it might be
difficult to define it but you

00:20:37.133 --> 00:20:39.920
have a gut feeling about what it
is.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.828
So, you know Homer is
actually--and this is part of

00:20:42.828 --> 00:20:45.619
the show--is actually of limited
intelligence.

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:48.993
My colleague is of very high
intelligence,

00:20:48.993 --> 00:20:51.379
a wonderful fellow,
[laughter]

00:20:51.379 --> 00:20:55.986
but he's probably not as smart
as that guy who is really,

00:20:55.986 --> 00:20:58.865
really smart.
And this guy,

00:20:58.865 --> 00:21:02.710
Ralph Wiggum,
is particularly stupid.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:03.980
[laughter]
And so you have a range.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.579
And it's important to figure
out how to characterize it;

00:21:06.579 --> 00:21:09.568
this is what research does,
but there's a gut feeling that

00:21:09.568 --> 00:21:12.662
there are some people who are
smart and other people who are

00:21:12.662 --> 00:21:15.913
very smart and some people who
are dumb and others who are very

00:21:15.913 --> 00:21:17.789
dumb.
What you want to do,

00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:21.621
from a scientific standpoint,
is characterize this in a more

00:21:21.621 --> 00:21:25.583
robust and interesting fashion.
And the textbook has a nice

00:21:25.583 --> 00:21:29.089
review of the history of
attempts to define and measure

00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:31.881
intelligence,
but there is a couple of ideas

00:21:31.881 --> 00:21:35.863
I want to focus on.
One is an idea developed by

00:21:35.863 --> 00:21:40.710
Spearman, which is there's two
types of intelligence.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:47.504
There is "G" and there is "S."
"S" is your ability on specific

00:21:47.504 --> 00:21:50.797
tests.
So, if there is ten tests that

00:21:50.797 --> 00:21:54.906
you're given as part of an IQ
test, ten subtests,

00:21:54.906 --> 00:21:59.700
you'll get a different score on
each of the subtests.

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:02.821
There'll be a math test and a
reading test and a spatial test

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:07.984
and you'll get different scores.
"G" refers to a general

00:22:07.984 --> 00:22:12.455
intelligence.
And the general intelligence is

00:22:12.455 --> 00:22:16.490
something you bring to each of
the tests in common.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:20.380
So, this is diagrammed here.
You have these six tests.

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.853
For each of them there is an
"S" and then above that there is

00:22:24.853 --> 00:22:27.581
a "G."
Now, "G" is a very important

00:22:27.581 --> 00:22:29.598
notion.
The term "G" is used by

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:32.599
psychologists a lot even in
casual conversation.

00:22:32.599 --> 00:22:34.590
People say, "So,
what do you think of him?"

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.707
"I think he is high 'G.'"
And what you mean is he's a

00:22:38.707 --> 00:22:41.789
smart guy.
Why do you need "G?"

00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:44.488
Well, you wouldn't need "G" if
your performance on each of

00:22:44.488 --> 00:22:46.759
these tests had nothing to do
with each other.

00:22:46.759 --> 00:22:51.344
If the tests were genuinely
separate, there'd be no general

00:22:51.344 --> 00:22:54.123
intelligence.
But what people find over and

00:22:54.123 --> 00:22:57.091
over again is that when it comes
to explaining people's

00:22:57.091 --> 00:22:59.620
performance on multiple
intellectual tasks,

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.356
there's two things going on.
There's how good there is--they

00:23:03.356 --> 00:23:07.196
are on the specific task,
but then there's also a sort of

00:23:07.196 --> 00:23:10.900
general correlation that people
bring to the tasks.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:13.769
And I could express this with
an athletic analogy.

00:23:13.769 --> 00:23:18.117
Imagine I'm running a gym and
we have all of these different

00:23:18.117 --> 00:23:21.537
athletic tests.
So, we have a running test,

00:23:21.537 --> 00:23:25.630
we have a basketball shooting
test, a swimming test,

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:30.045
fencing, a list of ten of them.
Now, each of you go through

00:23:30.045 --> 00:23:33.480
each of the tests and then
you'll each get ten scores.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.852
But what we'll discover is that
the scores are not independent

00:23:38.852 --> 00:23:42.068
of one another.
People who are good at one

00:23:42.068 --> 00:23:44.910
athletic thing tend to be good
at another.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.970
If there's somebody who's
really good at running and

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.910
swimming, odds are they're
probably pretty good at

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.490
climbing.
And the same thing holds for

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:57.349
IQ, which is above and beyond
how good people are at specific

00:23:57.349 --> 00:24:00.951
things there seems to be a
factor as to how well they are

00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:04.670
in general.
And this factor is known as "G."

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.663
Now, there's,
again, an extensive history of

00:24:08.663 --> 00:24:14.329
modern intelligence tests and
what's really interesting is the

00:24:14.329 --> 00:24:17.265
tests now.
What you need to know about the

00:24:17.265 --> 00:24:19.323
modern tests,
the Wechsler test for both

00:24:19.323 --> 00:24:21.750
adults and children,
is how they're scored.

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:29.990
The way they are scored is that
100 is average.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:35.029
So, it's just automatic.
Whatever the average is is 100.

00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:37.458
It's as if I did the
Midterm--graded the Midterm,

00:24:37.458 --> 00:24:39.836
computed the average,
gave everybody who got the

00:24:39.836 --> 00:24:41.860
average 100, said your score is
100.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:46.835
It's just the average.
It works on the normal curve

00:24:46.835 --> 00:24:53.889
and what this means is that it
works so that the majority,

00:24:53.889 --> 00:24:59.829
68%, get between 85 and 115 on
their IQ test.

00:24:59.829 --> 00:25:07.180
The vast majority,
95%, get between 70 and 130.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:10.553
If you are, say,
above 145 IQ,

00:25:10.553 --> 00:25:15.554
which I imagine some people in
the room are,

00:25:15.554 --> 00:25:20.440
you belong to 0.13% of the
population.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.250
That's the way IQ tests work.
Now, this is about IQ tests.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:29.210
We could now ask about their
reliability and their validity.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.811
What do they mean?
Well, this has turned out to be

00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:36.955
a matter of extreme debate.
This just reiterates what I

00:25:36.955 --> 00:25:39.990
just said.
A lot of the debate was spawned

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:44.380
by the book by Herrnstein and
Murray about--called The Bell

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:48.770
Curve. And in The Bell
Curve these authors made the

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.728
argument that IQ matters
immensely for everyday life and

00:25:52.728 --> 00:25:57.046
that people's status in society
– how rich they are and how

00:25:57.046 --> 00:26:01.292
successful they are – follows
from their IQ as measured in

00:26:01.292 --> 00:26:05.548
standard IQ tests.
Now, this book made a lot of

00:26:05.548 --> 00:26:10.351
claims and it's probably before
many of you--many of your time,

00:26:10.351 --> 00:26:14.326
but spawned huge controversy.
And as a result of this

00:26:14.326 --> 00:26:17.319
controversy some interesting
papers came out.

00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:21.246
One response to the Herrnstein
and Murray book was by the

00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.839
American Psychological
Association,

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:27.035
which put together a group of
fifty leading researchers in

00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:30.175
intelligence to write a report
on what they thought about

00:26:30.175 --> 00:26:32.530
intelligence--what they thought
about,

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.135
"Does IQ matter?
How does IQ relate to

00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:37.013
intelligence?
How does--what's the

00:26:37.013 --> 00:26:40.230
different--why are people
different in intelligence?

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:42.950
Why do different human groups
differ in intelligence?"

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:44.917
and so on.
At the same time,

00:26:44.917 --> 00:26:48.051
there was also another group of
IQ researchers,

00:26:48.051 --> 00:26:52.137
not quite the same as the first
group, got together and wrote

00:26:52.137 --> 00:26:55.073
another report.
And if you're interested in

00:26:55.073 --> 00:26:58.630
this, the links to the reports
are on the Power Point slide.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:03.808
Well, what did they conclude?
The conclusions were slightly

00:27:03.808 --> 00:27:08.703
different but here's the broad
consensus by the experts

00:27:08.703 --> 00:27:12.329
regarding the importance of IQ
tests.

00:27:12.329 --> 00:27:16.201
And the claim is IQ is strongly
related more so--probably more

00:27:16.201 --> 00:27:19.629
so than any other single
measurable human trait to many

00:27:19.629 --> 00:27:22.151
important educational,
occupational,

00:27:22.151 --> 00:27:25.326
economic, and social outcomes.
In some cases,

00:27:25.326 --> 00:27:29.944
the correlation is very strong
such as success in school and

00:27:29.944 --> 00:27:33.471
success in military training.
In other cases,

00:27:33.471 --> 00:27:37.150
it's moderate but robust such
as "social competence."

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.411
And in other cases it's smaller
but consistent,

00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:44.097
"law abidingness," and they
conclude whatever IQ test

00:27:44.097 --> 00:27:48.280
measure it is of great practical
and social importance.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.942
So, IQ matters.
More particularly,

00:27:50.942 --> 00:27:53.981
IQ matters for "social
achievement," for "prestigious

00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:55.816
positions,"
and for "on the job

00:27:55.816 --> 00:27:58.329
performance" and other
work-related variables.

00:27:58.329 --> 00:28:02.332
If I know your IQ score,
I know something about you that

00:28:02.332 --> 00:28:04.861
matters.
It's not irrelevant just as if

00:28:04.861 --> 00:28:08.104
I know your score on a
personality test of The Big Five

00:28:08.104 --> 00:28:11.647
I would know something about you
that actually would tell me

00:28:11.647 --> 00:28:14.950
something interesting about you
in the real world.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:18.488
On the other hand,
there's a lot of controversy

00:28:18.488 --> 00:28:21.180
about why this connection
exists.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:25.343
So, to some extent,
people have worried that the

00:28:25.343 --> 00:28:29.950
effectiveness of IQ is a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:35.669
And here is why.
If society takes IQ tests

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:39.880
important--seriously,
they become important.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.449
So, it's true that your IQ is
very related to your success in

00:28:44.449 --> 00:28:47.420
getting into a good school like
Yale.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.369
But the reason for this,
in large extent,

00:28:50.369 --> 00:28:54.055
is because to get to Yale they
give you an IQ test,

00:28:54.055 --> 00:28:57.243
the SAT.
So, the same for graduate

00:28:57.243 --> 00:28:59.079
school.
There is the GRE,

00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:02.298
which is yet another IQ test.
So, to some extent,

00:29:02.298 --> 00:29:04.519
it's a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:08.401
I could make--Society could
choose to make how tall you are

00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:11.480
extremely important for
educational success.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.839
They could say nobody under six
feet tall gets into Yale.

00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:17.357
And then some psych professor
would stand up and say,

00:29:17.357 --> 00:29:19.390
"Of course, height is
profoundly related to

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.011
educational accomplishment,"
and it would be because people

00:29:23.011 --> 00:29:25.521
made it so.
So, to some extent,

00:29:25.521 --> 00:29:30.830
the society that draws highly
on IQ tests regarding promotion

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:36.316
and educational achievement and
military status and so on--it's

00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:41.359
just going to follow that IQ
then becomes important.

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:44.627
At the same time,
however, the role of IQ is

00:29:44.627 --> 00:29:48.579
pretty clearly not entirely a
social construction.

00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:53.381
There is some evidence that
your IQ score relates to

00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:58.842
intelligence in an interesting
sense including domains like

00:29:58.842 --> 00:30:04.520
mental speed and memory span.
So, your score on an IQ test,

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.154
for instance,
is to some extent related to

00:30:08.154 --> 00:30:12.940
how fast you could think and
your memory abilities.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:16.423
Now, I want to shift to the
second half of the class and

00:30:16.423 --> 00:30:19.151
talk about why.
So, we talked about two

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:21.520
differences, one in
"personality",

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.474
one "intelligence."
I want to talk about why people

00:30:25.474 --> 00:30:29.610
differ but before I do,
do people have any questions?

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.598
Yes.
Student:

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:45.829
About personality--This morning
I took a test--The way the test

00:30:45.829 --> 00:30:52.771
was,
they asked you 100 questions

00:30:52.771 --> 00:31:01.312
and [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:31:01.312 --> 00:31:08.529
It's a good question.
The question is this young man

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:11.470
took--just took a personality
test.

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:15.960
He was accepted into Slytherin,
which is a Hogwarts reference.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.845
I'm hip to that [laughter]
and--but the question is a good

00:31:20.845 --> 00:31:23.803
one.
You're a clever man,

00:31:23.803 --> 00:31:29.299
high "G," and you wanted to be
in Slytherin.

00:31:29.299 --> 00:31:31.480
How do we know you didn't work
the test?

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.568
You're going to get these
personality tests all the time

00:31:34.568 --> 00:31:37.207
and the personality
tests--You're applying for a

00:31:37.207 --> 00:31:40.463
business and one of the tests
says "I like to steal from my

00:31:40.463 --> 00:31:42.550
bosses."
Well, I don't think so.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.674
No.
That's a little IQ test right

00:31:44.674 --> 00:31:47.099
there.
So, the question is how do you

00:31:47.099 --> 00:31:50.934
avoid that problem?
The test constructors have done

00:31:50.934 --> 00:31:54.109
so in certain clever ways.
For instance,

00:31:54.109 --> 00:31:58.660
there are often catch questions
designed to catch a liar.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.266
Some of these questions pose
very unrealistic phenomena so

00:32:03.266 --> 00:32:08.035
you might have a question in
there saying "I have never done

00:32:08.035 --> 00:32:12.177
anything I am ashamed of."
Now, some people will say,

00:32:12.177 --> 00:32:15.680
"Yes, that's true of me," but
they tend to be liars.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.980
And so, unrealistic questions
tend to catch liars.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.273
Also, you get the same question
asked in different ways across

00:32:23.273 --> 00:32:26.458
the one hundred items and they
could use the correlations to

00:32:26.458 --> 00:32:29.909
figure these things out.
Again, the proof is sort of in

00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:32.974
the pudding.
The reliability and validity of

00:32:32.974 --> 00:32:36.491
a test is determined,
in part, by just how well it

00:32:36.491 --> 00:32:40.940
does at predicting your future
performance on the test and your

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:44.977
real world performance.
And a test that is easily

00:32:44.977 --> 00:32:50.005
fooled--easily tricked by smart
people wouldn't survive long as

00:32:50.005 --> 00:32:53.697
a personality test.
So, we know the test you got is

00:32:53.697 --> 00:32:57.450
a pretty good test because it
seems to work for most people.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:33:01.398
Yes.
Student:

00:33:01.398 --> 00:33:04.983
[inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:07.967
It's a good question.
The question was about

00:33:07.967 --> 00:33:09.909
"Emotional IQ," which is
something I'm actually going to

00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:11.569
touch upon a little bit later in
the course,

00:33:11.569 --> 00:33:14.140
but people have talked about
different forms of intelligence.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.481
And emotional intelligence,
social intelligence,

00:33:18.481 --> 00:33:23.191
is arguably a candidate for
success across different

00:33:23.191 --> 00:33:26.958
domains.
The evidence for its predictive

00:33:26.958 --> 00:33:32.188
power is not as strong as for
regular IQ tests so you might be

00:33:32.188 --> 00:33:34.692
right.
It might turn out to be a much

00:33:34.692 --> 00:33:37.696
better predictor but one,
it's not clear that we know

00:33:37.696 --> 00:33:39.804
that yet.
Peter Salovey has actually done

00:33:39.804 --> 00:33:42.541
some very interesting research
on this and is continuing work

00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:44.888
along those lines.
The second thing is emotional

00:33:44.888 --> 00:33:47.473
intelligence is actually related
to good, old-fashioned

00:33:47.473 --> 00:33:49.724
intelligence.
They kind of pull together a

00:33:49.724 --> 00:33:51.375
lot.
So, it's not entirely separate

00:33:51.375 --> 00:33:54.144
but that's a good point and I'd
like to return to it a little

00:33:54.144 --> 00:33:56.240
bit later on in the course.
Yes.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:01.297
Student:
[inaudible]

00:34:01.297 --> 00:34:10.050
Professor Paul Bloom:
Good question.

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.550
How do you determine when--what
a good test is?

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.181
And again, it's a real art
going through the details of how

00:34:16.181 --> 00:34:19.625
to do that but the broad answers
involve reliability and

00:34:19.625 --> 00:34:22.187
validity.
It's a good test if I test you

00:34:22.187 --> 00:34:25.449
today and I test you tomorrow
and I get the same score.

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:30.288
It's a really good test if your
score on that test predicts your

00:34:30.288 --> 00:34:33.360
grades or, if it's a personality
test,

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.489
predicts how many girlfriends
you have or predicts whether

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:41.662
people think you're a nice guy.
So, you have to see both the

00:34:41.662 --> 00:34:45.481
replicability of the test over
time but also its relationship

00:34:45.481 --> 00:34:48.369
to real world phenomena.
And that's important, again.

00:34:48.369 --> 00:34:51.672
Why do we know the Batman,
Wonder Woman,

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:55.929
Hulk test is a bad one?
Well, one answer is because

00:34:55.929 --> 00:35:00.999
what I--how I score on that test
isn't going to tell you anything

00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:02.936
about me.
It's not going to relate to my

00:35:02.936 --> 00:35:04.248
grades.
It's not going to relate to how

00:35:04.248 --> 00:35:06.683
well I'm liked.
How do we know the SAT is

00:35:06.683 --> 00:35:10.180
useful?
Well, it actually corresponds

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:15.010
with other things like grades.
Yes, in back.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:20.542
Student:
[inaudible]

00:35:20.542 --> 00:35:29.480
Professor Paul Bloom:
Absolutely.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.282
The question is--When I'm
talking about personality I'm

00:35:32.282 --> 00:35:35.032
defining it in terms of
something which is stable over

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:36.317
time.
And your question,

00:35:36.317 --> 00:35:38.634
which is a good one,
is, "How do we know it's stable

00:35:38.634 --> 00:35:40.420
over time?"
Can't it change?

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.072
And the answer is "yeah."
A lot of personality does

00:35:43.072 --> 00:35:46.304
change over time.
A personality test you give to

00:35:46.304 --> 00:35:50.365
a ten-year-old will relate but
not so strongly with that

00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:53.719
individual when he's fifty.
On the other hand,

00:35:53.719 --> 00:35:57.519
we know that the psychological
claim that there exists such a

00:35:57.519 --> 00:36:00.750
thing as personality and it is
stable over time.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.815
It's supported by the fact that
if you're an extrovert now

00:36:03.815 --> 00:36:06.720
you'll likely be an extrovert
twenty years from now.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.460
Not perfectly, so you're right.
You could change.

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.780
You could become an introvert,
you could become more of an

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.868
extrovert, but wherever you
stand now is significantly

00:36:15.868 --> 00:36:18.489
related to where you'll be in
the future.

00:36:18.489 --> 00:36:21.500
And that justifies talking
about it as a stable trait.

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:24.510
Same with IQ.
Your IQ might change.

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:26.147
It might go up,
it might go down,

00:36:26.147 --> 00:36:29.114
but it won't go up and go down
that much and this is why it

00:36:29.114 --> 00:36:31.927
makes sense to talk about
intelligence as a more or less

00:36:31.927 --> 00:36:33.980
stable trait.
Okay.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:41.476
Why are we different?
Well, you're different because

00:36:41.476 --> 00:36:44.652
of two things:
Your genes and your

00:36:44.652 --> 00:36:48.597
environment, your nature and
your nurture,

00:36:48.597 --> 00:36:52.350
your heredity and your
experience.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.548
And this doesn't say anything.
This is just defining the

00:36:55.548 --> 00:36:58.524
question.
But the question of the role of

00:36:58.524 --> 00:37:02.659
genes and the role of
environment in explaining human

00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:07.429
differences is an interesting
one and it could be explored in

00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:10.532
different ways.
But before talking about it I

00:37:10.532 --> 00:37:12.670
have to clear up a common
misconception.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.144
I'm going to talk about the
effects of genes and I'm going

00:37:16.144 --> 00:37:19.070
to talk about heredity but I
want to be clear.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:23.988
I am talking about the role of
genes and also the role of

00:37:23.988 --> 00:37:29.346
environment in explaining human
differences, not in explaining

00:37:29.346 --> 00:37:33.289
human characteristics.
So, the distinction is we're

00:37:33.289 --> 00:37:36.311
interested in the amount of
variation due to genetic

00:37:36.311 --> 00:37:38.756
differences,
not the proportion of an

00:37:38.756 --> 00:37:41.349
individual's trait that's due to
genes.

00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:44.809
So for instance,
you could pull these apart.

00:37:44.809 --> 00:37:49.344
The question of--When we ask
what's the role of genes,

00:37:49.344 --> 00:37:53.880
what's the role of heredity in
how tall people are,

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:58.379
the question is not asking for
you--what is the role of your

00:37:58.379 --> 00:38:01.429
genes in determining how tall
you are?

00:38:01.429 --> 00:38:03.409
It's not clear that's even a
sensible question.

00:38:03.409 --> 00:38:06.144
The question is there's a
height difference between you

00:38:06.144 --> 00:38:08.937
and me and him and her.
How do we explain that

00:38:08.937 --> 00:38:11.300
difference?
And I could illustrate why

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.950
heredity doesn't mean the same
thing as the contribution of the

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:18.370
genes.
Height is reasonably heritable,

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:24.246
meaning the differences between
people in the population and how

00:38:24.246 --> 00:38:27.789
tall they are is due in large
part,

00:38:27.789 --> 00:38:30.445
not entirely,
but in large part to their

00:38:30.445 --> 00:38:32.902
genes.
What about the number of legs

00:38:32.902 --> 00:38:35.993
people have?
Well, the number of legs people

00:38:35.993 --> 00:38:39.020
have from zero,
one or two, is actually not

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:43.200
very heritable at all because
almost everybody has two legs

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.667
and people who have fewer than
two legs typically have lost one

00:38:47.667 --> 00:38:52.099
or both legs in an accident.
It's not due to their genes.

00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:55.942
So, of course,
whether or not you have legs is

00:38:55.942 --> 00:39:01.150
a very genetic matter but the
differences in number of legs is

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:05.040
not usually genetic.
And so, heredity is a claim

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:08.380
about differences,
not a claim about the origin of

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.739
any specific trait.
Well, now we--That's what

00:39:11.739 --> 00:39:15.534
heredity, which is genetic--Now,
we could talk about

00:39:15.534 --> 00:39:17.581
environment.
And we could break up

00:39:17.581 --> 00:39:19.490
environment into two sorts of
environment.

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:23.594
One is shared environment.
And shared environment is the

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:27.605
extent to which the differences
are caused by things--by

00:39:27.605 --> 00:39:31.980
phenomena that people raised in
the same household share.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:36.789
So if one--Suppose some of you
are neurotic.

00:39:36.789 --> 00:39:40.587
And suppose we want to say part
of that's due to your

00:39:40.587 --> 00:39:43.654
environment.
Well, suppose you're neurotic

00:39:43.654 --> 00:39:47.944
because you have lousy parents.
That would be part of your

00:39:47.944 --> 00:39:52.248
shared environment because
presumably siblings raised in

00:39:52.248 --> 00:39:56.630
the same household would have
the same lousy parents.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:59.938
This is contrasted with
non-shared environment,

00:39:59.938 --> 00:40:03.406
which is everything else.
Suppose I think you're neurotic

00:40:03.406 --> 00:40:06.557
because when you were five years
old somebody threw a snowball at

00:40:06.557 --> 00:40:08.330
you and it bounced off your
head.

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:12.162
That's non-shared environment.
Suppose you're neurotic because

00:40:12.162 --> 00:40:15.023
you won the lottery when you
were twenty-one and all the

00:40:15.023 --> 00:40:17.516
money messed you up.
That'd be non-shared

00:40:17.516 --> 00:40:20.177
environment.
So, what you have here is

00:40:20.177 --> 00:40:24.177
heredity, shared environment and
non-shared environment,

00:40:24.177 --> 00:40:27.230
and this equals one.
That's everything.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:30.930
Non-shared environment is a
sort of garbage can category

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.833
that includes everything that's
not heredity and not shared

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:37.531
environment.
Suppose you think you're

00:40:37.531 --> 00:40:41.652
neurotic because aliens from the
planet Pluto are zapping your

00:40:41.652 --> 00:40:44.539
brain.
Suppose you're right.

00:40:44.539 --> 00:40:47.435
Well, that would be non-shared
environment because they're,

00:40:47.435 --> 00:40:50.429
presumably, not necessarily
zapping your siblings' brains.

00:40:50.429 --> 00:40:53.409
Everything else is non-shared
environment.

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:58.431
It becomes interesting to ask,
for all of these differences,

00:40:58.431 --> 00:41:01.750
the physical differences like
height,

00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:05.739
but psychological differences
like personality and

00:41:05.739 --> 00:41:09.077
intelligence,
how do we parcel it out into

00:41:09.077 --> 00:41:12.659
what's genetic and what's
environmental?

00:41:12.659 --> 00:41:16.614
This proves to be really
difficult in the real world

00:41:16.614 --> 00:41:21.111
because in the real world it's
hard to pull apart genes and

00:41:21.111 --> 00:41:25.079
environments.
So, you and me will have

00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:29.050
different personalities.
Why?

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:32.363
Well, we were raised by
different parents and we have

00:41:32.363 --> 00:41:36.101
different genes.
We can't tell--My brother and

00:41:36.101 --> 00:41:41.372
me might share all sorts of
things in common but we have the

00:41:41.372 --> 00:41:45.650
same parents and the same genes,
fifty percent of the same genes.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:48.769
So how do we tell what's
causing us to be alike?

00:41:48.769 --> 00:41:53.289
So to do--to pull these things
apart you need to be clever.

00:41:53.289 --> 00:41:56.579
You need to use the tools of
behavioral genetics.

00:41:56.579 --> 00:42:01.255
And to use these tools you have
to exploit certain regularities

00:42:01.255 --> 00:42:03.970
about genes and about
environment.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:09.019
One thing is this.
Some people are clones.

00:42:09.019 --> 00:42:11.940
Monozygotic twins are genetic
duplicates.

00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.430
They share one hundred percent
of the same genes.

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:20.250
That's kind of interesting.
Dizygotic twins are not clones.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:23.586
They share fifty/fifty.
They are just like regular

00:42:23.586 --> 00:42:27.083
siblings.
And adopted siblings have no

00:42:27.083 --> 00:42:32.756
special genetic overlap.
That's zero percent above and

00:42:32.756 --> 00:42:36.718
beyond randomness.
Those three groups then become

00:42:36.718 --> 00:42:40.608
rather interesting particularly
when we keep in mind that by

00:42:40.608 --> 00:42:44.367
definition two people raised in
the same house by the same

00:42:44.367 --> 00:42:48.720
parents have one hundred percent
the same shared environment.

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.400
So now, we can start to answer
these questions.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.240
Suppose you find that
monozygotic twins are much more

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:03.349
similar than dizygotic twins.
Well, that would suggest that

00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:06.863
there's a large role of genes in
those traits that you're

00:43:06.863 --> 00:43:09.578
interested in.
It would not cinch the matter

00:43:09.578 --> 00:43:11.909
because there are other factors
at work.

00:43:11.909 --> 00:43:14.508
For instance,
monozygotic twins look more

00:43:14.508 --> 00:43:18.082
alike than dizygotic twins and
maybe they have different

00:43:18.082 --> 00:43:21.655
and--they have more similar
environments because of this

00:43:21.655 --> 00:43:26.162
similarity in appearance.
Are monozygotic twins just as

00:43:26.162 --> 00:43:30.740
similar as dizygotic twins?
If so, then it would show that

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:34.429
that extra overlap in genes
doesn't really matter.

00:43:34.429 --> 00:43:38.119
And so, it would suggest a low
role of heredity.

00:43:38.119 --> 00:43:42.353
Are adopted children highly
similar to their brothers and

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:45.773
sisters?
If so, then there's a high role

00:43:45.773 --> 00:43:49.913
of shared environment.
Suppose the Bloom children,

00:43:49.913 --> 00:43:54.399
and there are seven of them,
all have an IQ of 104 and we

00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:59.446
adopt three kids and then at the
end of the day those three kids

00:43:59.446 --> 00:44:03.485
each have an IQ of 104.
That would suggest that--And we

00:44:03.485 --> 00:44:06.670
do this over and over again
across different families.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:11.996
That would suggest that there's
something about the Bloom family

00:44:11.996 --> 00:44:16.139
being raised by me that gives
you an IQ of 104.

00:44:16.139 --> 00:44:19.489
On the other hand,
if the IQ of the adopted kids

00:44:19.489 --> 00:44:24.050
had no relationship to those of
the biological Bloom children,

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.932
it would suggest that being
raised by me has no effects

00:44:26.932 --> 00:44:29.050
really on your IQ.
It's sort of separate.

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:35.044
A separate--A second--A final
contrast, which is the thing

00:44:35.044 --> 00:44:40.198
that psychologists love,
is identical twins reared

00:44:40.198 --> 00:44:42.638
apart.
That's the gold standard

00:44:42.638 --> 00:44:45.819
because you have these people
who are clones but they're

00:44:45.819 --> 00:44:50.121
raised in different families.
And to the extent that they are

00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:54.550
similar this suggests it's a
similarity of their genes.

00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:57.711
And in fact,
one of the most surprising

00:44:57.711 --> 00:45:01.953
findings in behavioral
genetics--The caption here is

00:45:01.953 --> 00:45:05.513
"Separated at Birth,
the Mallifert Twins Meet

00:45:05.513 --> 00:45:08.363
Accidentally."
ended up at a patent office

00:45:08.363 --> 00:45:11.770
with the same device.
One of the hugely surprising

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:15.463
findings from behavioral
genetics is how alike identical

00:45:15.463 --> 00:45:18.654
twins reared apart are.
They seem to have similar

00:45:18.654 --> 00:45:21.889
attitudes to the death penalty,
to religion and to modern

00:45:21.889 --> 00:45:24.144
music.
They have similar rates of

00:45:24.144 --> 00:45:26.880
behavior in crime,
gambling and divorce.

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:30.949
They often have been found to
have bizarre similarities.

00:45:30.949 --> 00:45:34.550
They meet after being separated
at birth and they meet at age

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:38.030
thirty and then it turns out
that they both get in to a lot

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.570
of trouble because they pretend
to sneeze in elevators.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:45.103
There was one pair of twins
studied by behavioral genetics

00:45:45.103 --> 00:45:48.762
who were known as the "Giggle
Twins" because they were--both

00:45:48.762 --> 00:45:51.842
would always giggle,
they'd burst into giggles at

00:45:51.842 --> 00:45:55.140
every moment even though it
couldn't be environment because

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.635
they weren't raised together.
More objectively,

00:45:58.635 --> 00:46:04.154
the brain scans of identical
twins reared apart show that

00:46:04.154 --> 00:46:10.166
their brains are so similar in
many cases you can't tell whose

00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:13.772
brain is who.
I could tell your brain from my

00:46:13.772 --> 00:46:17.258
brain from a brain scan and my
brother's brain from my brain

00:46:17.258 --> 00:46:19.744
from a brain scan.
But if I were to have an

00:46:19.744 --> 00:46:23.009
identical twin it would be very
difficult to tell whose brain is

00:46:23.009 --> 00:46:25.550
whose even if we had no
environment in common.

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:29.155
So, this leads to two
surprising findings of

00:46:29.155 --> 00:46:33.090
behavioral genetics.
This is the first one.

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:37.719
There is high heritability for
almost everything.

00:46:37.719 --> 00:46:40.513
For intelligence,
for personality,

00:46:40.513 --> 00:46:44.829
for how happy you are,
for how religious you are,

00:46:44.829 --> 00:46:48.601
for your political orientation,
there--for your sexual

00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:51.590
orientation, there is high
heritability.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:55.329
There's a high effect of genes
for just about everything.

00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:59.622
Now, that's actually not the
controversial thing I'm going to

00:46:59.622 --> 00:47:02.000
tell you.
But before getting to the more

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.181
controversial thing I want to
raise another issue which often

00:47:05.181 --> 00:47:08.309
gets discussed and has a good
treatment in the textbook.

00:47:08.309 --> 00:47:12.296
This suggests that individual
differences within this--within

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:16.021
a group have genetic causes.
Does that mean that group

00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:19.760
differences are largely the
result of genetic causes?

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.999
So, we know that there are
clear differences in IQ scores

00:47:23.999 --> 00:47:28.163
among American racial groups,
between whites and Asians,

00:47:28.163 --> 00:47:31.039
African Americans,
Ashkenazi Jews.

00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:34.267
There's clear and reliable IQ
differences as well as some

00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:37.089
other differences.
Now, to some extent,

00:47:37.089 --> 00:47:41.179
these groups are partially
socially constructed.

00:47:41.179 --> 00:47:45.121
And what this means is that
whether or not you fall into a

00:47:45.121 --> 00:47:48.509
group it's not entirely
determined by your genetic

00:47:48.509 --> 00:47:50.945
makeup.
It's often determined by social

00:47:50.945 --> 00:47:53.596
decisions.
So, whether or not you count as

00:47:53.596 --> 00:47:56.979
a Jew, for instance,
depends not entirely on genetic

00:47:56.979 --> 00:48:00.893
factors but also on factors such
as whether you're reform or

00:48:00.893 --> 00:48:04.807
orthodox and whether you--so
whether you would accept that a

00:48:04.807 --> 00:48:08.920
child of a Jewish man and a
non-Jewish woman is Jewish.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.696
Similarly, categories like
African American and white and

00:48:12.696 --> 00:48:16.202
Asian often overlap broad
genetic categories and they

00:48:16.202 --> 00:48:19.170
don't make fully coherent
genetic sense.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:23.123
At the same time though,
there is plainly some genetic

00:48:23.123 --> 00:48:27.076
differences across human groups
and say with regard to

00:48:27.076 --> 00:48:31.133
vulnerability to disease.
Ashkenazi Jews for instance are

00:48:31.133 --> 00:48:33.931
vulnerable to Tay-Sachs.
And the fact that you could

00:48:33.931 --> 00:48:36.381
have this sort of genetic
vulnerability suggests that

00:48:36.381 --> 00:48:38.690
there is some sort of reality to
these groups.

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.511
So, you have to ask the
question now,

00:48:41.511 --> 00:48:46.213
to what extent does the high
heritability in individuals mean

00:48:46.213 --> 00:48:51.150
that there has to be a heritable
explanation across groups?

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:55.591
And the answer is "not at all."
I'm not saying that this means

00:48:55.591 --> 00:48:58.559
that there's no genetic
explanation for human group

00:48:58.559 --> 00:49:01.822
differences.
All I'm saying is the question

00:49:01.822 --> 00:49:04.985
of the phenomena
of--within-group genetic

00:49:04.985 --> 00:49:09.018
differences does not mean that
there is across-group

00:49:09.018 --> 00:49:12.354
genetic--sorry,
between-group genetic

00:49:12.354 --> 00:49:15.742
differences.
There is a nice example by

00:49:15.742 --> 00:49:18.577
Richard Lewontin,
the geneticist,

00:49:18.577 --> 00:49:23.625
where he imagines two plots
of--what are you--some sort of

00:49:23.625 --> 00:49:27.069
wheat,
yeah, two plots of land and

00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:30.820
each one has a set of seeds
and--Oh, no.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.170
They're over there.
No.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:35.329
Anyway, one of them you
fertilize a lot.

00:49:35.329 --> 00:49:37.260
The other one you fertilize a
little.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.857
Now, within each plot how much
the seed grows is actually

00:49:41.857 --> 00:49:45.880
largely determined by the
genetics of the seed.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.381
And so, you'd find high
heritability for growth in the

00:49:49.381 --> 00:49:52.438
seeds.
But the difference between

00:49:52.438 --> 00:49:55.940
groups has no genetic cause at
all.

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:59.059
It's caused by which groups you
fertilize more than others.

00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:02.550
Here's another way to do the
logic.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:06.684
Suppose from the middle down
here, you guys,

00:50:06.684 --> 00:50:11.685
I hate you, I really hate all
of you, and I like you,

00:50:11.685 --> 00:50:15.808
so I make up two Midterms.
You probably didn't notice but

00:50:15.808 --> 00:50:19.589
there were two Midterms.
This Midterm was fiercely hard,

00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:22.514
savagely hard.
It took many of you until the

00:50:22.514 --> 00:50:25.482
end of class to do it.
This Midterm was,

00:50:25.482 --> 00:50:29.590
"Which is bigger,
a dog or an elephant?"

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.481
[laughter]
because I like you and I want

00:50:31.481 --> 00:50:34.228
you all to succeed.
So, you have two different

00:50:34.228 --> 00:50:37.980
groups, you guys and you guys.
Within each group some people

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.079
are going to do better than
others.

00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:42.818
The explanation for that might
actually have to do with your

00:50:42.818 --> 00:50:44.194
genes.
It might have to do with your

00:50:44.194 --> 00:50:46.272
environment, how much you study,
but all sorts of reasons for

00:50:46.272 --> 00:50:48.193
that.
Within each group some of you

00:50:48.193 --> 00:50:51.593
will do better on the hard test
than others on the hard test,

00:50:51.593 --> 00:50:55.050
some better on the easy test
than others on the easy test.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.389
But how do we explain the group
difference?

00:50:57.389 --> 00:50:59.039
Well, it has nothing to do with
genes.

00:50:59.039 --> 00:51:01.731
The group difference,
the fact that you will do much

00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:03.895
worse than you,
has to do with the exams I

00:51:03.895 --> 00:51:05.285
give.
My point, again,

00:51:05.285 --> 00:51:07.915
is that there is a logical
difference between a

00:51:07.915 --> 00:51:11.477
within-group difference,
within this half of the class,

00:51:11.477 --> 00:51:14.975
and a difference between
groups, within--between this

00:51:14.975 --> 00:51:17.945
group and this group.
What do we know about--;So,

00:51:17.945 --> 00:51:21.006
that just shows they're not the
same thing but what's the fact

00:51:21.006 --> 00:51:23.613
of the matter?
What do we know about human

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:26.469
differences between different
human groups?

00:51:26.469 --> 00:51:30.774
Again, the textbook has a good
discussion of this but I'm going

00:51:30.774 --> 00:51:34.662
to give two reasons from the
textbook that at least group

00:51:34.662 --> 00:51:37.994
differences are at least to a
large extent due to

00:51:37.994 --> 00:51:40.980
environmental and not genetic
causes.

00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:44.654
One is that the differences we
find in IQ seem to correspond

00:51:44.654 --> 00:51:48.204
better to socially defined
groups than genetically defined

00:51:48.204 --> 00:51:50.445
groups.
They seem to correspond to

00:51:50.445 --> 00:51:54.096
groups defined in terms of how
people treat you and how people

00:51:54.096 --> 00:51:56.610
think about you as opposed to
your DNA.

00:51:56.610 --> 00:52:00.619
And to the extent that turns
out to be true that would mean

00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:04.283
that a genetic explanation is
not reasonable for those

00:52:04.283 --> 00:52:08.832
differences.
A second factor is that we know

00:52:08.832 --> 00:52:15.940
IQ can differ radically without
any genetic differences at all.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:20.679
And the most dramatic evidence
of that is the Flynn effect.

00:52:20.679 --> 00:52:24.150
The Flynn effect is one of the
freakier findings.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:28.984
The Flynn effect is the finding
that people have been getting

00:52:28.984 --> 00:52:34.528
smarter.
You are much smarter on average

00:52:34.528 --> 00:52:42.170
than your parents if--and the IQ
tests hide that.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:45.742
Here is why they hide that.
They hide that because they

00:52:45.742 --> 00:52:49.884
always make 100 the average.
So, you come home and you say,

00:52:49.884 --> 00:52:52.190
"Dad, Dad, I just did an IQ
test.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.315
I got 120."
And your father says,

00:52:55.315 --> 00:52:59.051
"Good work, Son.
I got 122 when I was your age,"

00:52:59.051 --> 00:53:03.578
but what neither of you
acknowledge is your test was

00:53:03.578 --> 00:53:06.036
much harder.
As people got better,

00:53:06.036 --> 00:53:08.449
they had to make the test
harder and harder.

00:53:08.449 --> 00:53:10.449
And this is plotted by the
Flynn effect.

00:53:10.449 --> 00:53:19.480
One of these lines is American
and one is Dutch.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:25.377
I don't know which is which but
the gist of it is that somebody

00:53:25.377 --> 00:53:31.369
who would have--that if you in
1980 would take the 1950 test,

00:53:31.369 --> 00:53:35.946
your average person in 1980
would score 120 on the 1950

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:38.791
test.
What this means is if you take

00:53:38.791 --> 00:53:43.219
your person who's average now
and push him back through time

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:45.539
twenty years,
thirty years,

00:53:45.539 --> 00:53:48.809
he would do much better than
average.

00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:53.208
Nobody knows why people are
getting smarter and there's

00:53:53.208 --> 00:53:56.514
different theories of this.
And in fact,

00:53:56.514 --> 00:54:00.289
well, wait until you see your
reading response.

00:54:00.289 --> 00:54:06.314
But what this illustrates is
that IQ can change dramatically

00:54:06.314 --> 00:54:11.929
over the span of a few decades
without any corresponding

00:54:11.929 --> 00:54:15.484
genetic change.
And that leaves open the

00:54:15.484 --> 00:54:18.310
possibility, in fact,
maybe the likelihood,

00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:21.539
that the differences we find in
human groups,

00:54:21.539 --> 00:54:23.606
existing human groups,
are caused by the same

00:54:23.606 --> 00:54:26.330
environmental effects that have
led to the Flynn effect.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:28.499
Okay.
This is not the surprising

00:54:28.499 --> 00:54:30.631
claim though,
the high heritability for

00:54:30.631 --> 00:54:33.730
almost everything.
This is the surprising claim.

00:54:33.730 --> 00:54:37.239
Almost everything that's not
genetic is due to non-shared

00:54:37.239 --> 00:54:41.213
environments.
The behavioral genetic analyses

00:54:41.213 --> 00:54:47.280
suggest that shared environment
counts for little or nothing.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:51.700
When it comes to personality or
intelligence then,

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:56.933
an adopted child is no more
similar to his siblings than he

00:54:56.933 --> 00:55:00.749
or she is to a stranger.
To put it a different way,

00:55:00.749 --> 00:55:03.378
the IQ correlation in
genetically unrelated adults who

00:55:03.378 --> 00:55:05.710
are raised in the same family is
about zero.

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:10.239
Suppose the Bloom family all
has an IQ of 104 and we adopt a

00:55:10.239 --> 00:55:12.886
kid.
What will this kid's--We adopt

00:55:12.886 --> 00:55:15.039
him as a baby.
We raise him to be a

00:55:15.039 --> 00:55:17.000
twenty-year-old.
What's his IQ?

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.053
Answer?
We have no idea because the IQ

00:55:20.053 --> 00:55:24.355
of the Bloom family who are
unrelated to him has no effect

00:55:24.355 --> 00:55:27.249
at all.
Now, if you think about the

00:55:27.249 --> 00:55:30.974
implications of it,
it becomes controversial and

00:55:30.974 --> 00:55:34.383
Newsweek,
I think, caught the big issue

00:55:34.383 --> 00:55:38.519
when they put in their title the
question "do parents matter?"

00:55:38.519 --> 00:55:42.483
And the question--And the issue
is parents are shared

00:55:42.483 --> 00:55:46.147
environment.
To say shared environment does

00:55:46.147 --> 00:55:51.428
not affect your intelligence or
your personality suggests that

00:55:51.428 --> 00:55:56.450
how your parents raised you does
not affect your gene--your

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:59.739
intelligence or your
personality.

00:55:59.739 --> 00:56:03.953
This isn't to say your parents
didn't have a big effect on your

00:56:03.953 --> 00:56:08.003
intelligence and personality.
Your parents had a huge effect

00:56:08.003 --> 00:56:11.372
on your intelligence and your
personality, around 0.5

00:56:11.372 --> 00:56:13.648
actually.
They had this effect at the

00:56:13.648 --> 00:56:16.021
moment of conception.
From then on in,

00:56:16.021 --> 00:56:20.269
they played very little role in
shaping you--what you are.

00:56:20.269 --> 00:56:23.516
The case for this which
generated the Newsweek

00:56:23.516 --> 00:56:27.262
cover came up in a controversial
book by Judith Harris called

00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:31.320
The Nurture Assumption
which has a very long subtitle,

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.964
"Why Parents Turn--Why Children
Turn Out the Way They Do,

00:56:34.964 --> 00:56:38.869
Parents Matter Less than You
Think and Peers Matter More."

00:56:38.869 --> 00:56:43.309
Judith Harris has had an
interesting history.

00:56:43.309 --> 00:56:47.968
She was kicked out of graduate
school at Harvard and told that

00:56:47.968 --> 00:56:51.709
she wouldn't amount to much.
The person who wrote the letter

00:56:51.709 --> 00:56:54.233
saying that she was not going to
amount to much was the

00:56:54.233 --> 00:56:55.869
department chair,
George Miller.

00:56:55.869 --> 00:57:00.303
In 1997, she won the George
Miller award for her astounding

00:57:00.303 --> 00:57:03.739
accomplishments.
And when she wrote the book she

00:57:03.739 --> 00:57:07.260
took as a starting point,
her point of disagreement,

00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:10.973
a famous poem by the poet
Philip Larkin and many of you

00:57:10.973 --> 00:57:14.277
have probably heard this.
The poem goes like this:

00:57:14.277 --> 00:57:16.449
They fuck you up,
your mum and dad.

00:57:16.449 --> 00:57:18.849
They may not mean to but they
do.

00:57:18.849 --> 00:57:23.214
They fill you with the faults
they had And add some extra just

00:57:23.214 --> 00:57:26.314
for you.
The last line of the poem,

00:57:26.314 --> 00:57:31.267
the last bit of the poem,
ends: "Man hands on misery to

00:57:31.267 --> 00:57:34.190
man.
It deepens like a coastal shelf.

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:38.080
Get out as early as you can and
don't have any kids yourself."

00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.672
It's beautiful.
[laughter]

00:57:40.672 --> 00:57:45.511
Harris wrote a rebuttal:
"How sharper than a serpent's

00:57:45.511 --> 00:57:49.620
tooth to hear your child make
such a fuss.

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:52.300
It isn't fair.
It's not the truth.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.719
He's fucked up,
yes, but not by us."

00:57:56.719 --> 00:57:58.898
[laughter]
Just to show that academic

00:57:58.898 --> 00:58:01.741
debates never end,
a British psychoanalyst named

00:58:01.741 --> 00:58:05.113
Oliver James,
outraged by Judith Harris' book

00:58:05.113 --> 00:58:09.649
The Nurture Assumption,
wrote another book in response

00:58:09.649 --> 00:58:13.200
called They Fuck You Up.
[laughter]

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:16.928
Now, how do you tell your
grandparents,

00:58:16.928 --> 00:58:19.660
"I wrote a book."
"What's it called?"

00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:25.880
"Can't tell you."
[laughter] Anyway, look.

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.760
If you're paying attention,
this has to sound wrong.

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.229
You must be thinking of course
there must be an effect of

00:58:32.229 --> 00:58:34.992
shared environment.
Of course parents have an

00:58:34.992 --> 00:58:38.336
effect.
After all, good kids have good

00:58:38.336 --> 00:58:41.877
parents.
There is no doubt at all that

00:58:41.877 --> 00:58:44.603
this is true.
There is a high correlation

00:58:44.603 --> 00:58:46.780
between parent and child for
everything.

00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.620
If your parents read a lot and
there's a lot of books in your

00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:52.979
house, you will become a reader.
If your parents are religious,

00:58:52.979 --> 00:58:57.639
you will be religious.
If you're raised by Bonnie and

00:58:57.639 --> 00:59:01.672
Clyde, you will be a young thug.
[laughter]

00:59:01.672 --> 00:59:03.659
If your parents are poor,
you're likely to be poor.

00:59:03.659 --> 00:59:06.230
If your parents are brilliant,
you're likely to be brilliant.

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:09.339
No doubt at all.
It is an extremely robust

00:59:09.339 --> 00:59:11.438
correlation.
But the problem is this

00:59:11.438 --> 00:59:14.260
correlation could be explained
in different ways.

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:17.456
Everybody thinks it's because
parents do something that

00:59:17.456 --> 00:59:20.131
affects their kids.
Your parents are bookish,

00:59:20.131 --> 00:59:23.280
they read to their kids,
so their kids become bookish,

00:59:26.389 --> 00:59:29.972
but another possibility,
which we know is true,

00:59:29.972 --> 00:59:34.178
that almost always parents
share their genes with their

00:59:34.178 --> 00:59:36.717
kids.
Another possibility is it's the

00:59:36.717 --> 00:59:38.614
parents who are
affecting--sorry,

00:59:38.614 --> 00:59:41.400
it's the child who is affecting
the parents,

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.527
not vice versa,
and to illustrate this,

00:59:44.527 --> 00:59:49.548
these different possibilities,
I want to tell you a little bit

00:59:49.548 --> 00:59:52.296
about a study.
And I really find this a

00:59:52.296 --> 00:59:55.343
fascinating study.
It was reported last year and

00:59:55.343 --> 00:59:58.726
it was a study shown
that--suggesting that family

00:59:58.726 --> 01:00:02.250
meals help teens avoid smoking,
alcohol, drugs.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.939
It involved a phone
questionnaire where they phoned

01:00:04.939 --> 01:00:07.360
up teenagers and their parents
and said, "Hey,

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.990
teenager.
Do you do a lot of drugs?"

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.619
"Yes."
"Do you have dinner with your

01:00:12.619 --> 01:00:14.159
parents?"
"No."

01:00:14.159 --> 01:00:19.163
And they take it off--and then
they ask other people and they

01:00:19.163 --> 01:00:24.249
find that the kids who are the
good kids have meals with their

01:00:24.249 --> 01:00:27.150
parents,
suggesting this headline.

01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:31.230
I like this study because I
have read--I must have read in

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:35.526
my career a thousand studies and
this is the worst study ever

01:00:35.526 --> 01:00:38.820
done [laughter]
in the history of science.

01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:43.337
And it's almost--We could
devote a week to discussing

01:00:43.337 --> 01:00:48.349
what's wrong with this study.
Let's just--But here's the idea.

01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:52.699
It is possible that they are
right.

01:00:52.699 --> 01:00:55.342
It is actually
possible--there's no--I have no

01:00:55.342 --> 01:00:58.572
evidence against it – that
having meals with your kids

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:02.229
makes them into good,
drug-free, non-promiscuous,

01:01:02.229 --> 01:01:05.185
non-drinking kids.
Of course, it's equally

01:01:05.185 --> 01:01:07.400
possible it's the other way
around.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:12.834
If little Johnny is kind of--is
out there smoking pot and

01:01:12.834 --> 01:01:17.590
cavorting with prostitutes and
stuff like that,

01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.890
he's not going to come home for
the family meal.

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:22.068
It's the other way around.
While if he's a good kid,

01:01:22.068 --> 01:01:24.190
he might be more likely to have
a family meal.

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:27.772
So, the direction--It might
actually be not family meals

01:01:27.772 --> 01:01:31.615
make good kids but rather good
kids stick around to have--if

01:01:31.615 --> 01:01:35.980
they have nothing better to do
and have meals with Mom and Dad.

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.774
[laughter]
Another possibility is there's

01:01:38.774 --> 01:01:42.801
good families and bad families.
A good family is likely to have

01:01:42.801 --> 01:01:44.690
drug-free kids and a family
meal.

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:48.579
A bad family is likely to have
stoned kids and no family meal.

01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:49.258
[laughter]
So, there--maybe there's an

01:01:49.258 --> 01:01:51.366
effect of that.
The parents had nothing to do

01:01:51.366 --> 01:01:55.710
with the family meal.
Here's the even weirder part.

01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:59.639
They didn't factor out age so
think about this.

01:01:59.639 --> 01:02:02.941
Their sample included children
ranging from twelve to seventeen

01:02:02.941 --> 01:02:05.869
but let me tell you something
about twelve-year-olds.

01:02:05.869 --> 01:02:10.594
Twelve-year-olds don't use a
lot of drugs and are likely to

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:14.487
eat with their family.
Seventeen-year-olds are stoned

01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:17.780
all the time and they don't eat
with their family.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.559
[laughter]
I've just begun on this study

01:02:20.559 --> 01:02:24.550
but the point is when you hear
something like--So now,

01:02:24.550 --> 01:02:27.610
take something which you may be
more likely to believe.

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:30.454
Maybe you believe that having
parents who read to their kids,

01:02:30.454 --> 01:02:34.983
that's good for their kids.
Well, maybe it is but most of

01:02:34.983 --> 01:02:39.550
these criticisms apply to that
study too.

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:43.619
A bookish kid is more likely to
get his parents to read to him.

01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:48.215
A good family--Parents who are
good parents in general are more

01:02:48.215 --> 01:02:52.589
likely to do all sorts of good
things to their kids and have

01:02:52.589 --> 01:02:55.515
good kids besides.
Take another case,

01:02:55.515 --> 01:02:57.890
the so-called cycle of
violence.

01:02:57.890 --> 01:03:01.280
Yes, it's true.
Parents who smack their kids

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.500
tend to have statistically more
violent kids.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:08.659
But maybe the causality goes
the other way around.

01:03:08.659 --> 01:03:11.603
Maybe if you have a kid who is
a troublemaker you're more

01:03:11.603 --> 01:03:14.413
likely to smack him.
Maybe, which seems to be

01:03:14.413 --> 01:03:17.581
entirely likely,
the propensity for violence is

01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:21.350
to some extent heritable.
And so, even if the kid was not

01:03:21.350 --> 01:03:24.733
raised by the smacking parent,
whatever properties of that

01:03:24.733 --> 01:03:28.235
parent caused him--led to that
violence got inherited by the

01:03:28.235 --> 01:03:30.475
kid.
Now, again, this isn't going to

01:03:30.475 --> 01:03:33.447
sit right for you and I've
had--I put this down because

01:03:33.447 --> 01:03:36.859
last year when I gave this talk
people ran up to me and told me

01:03:36.859 --> 01:03:38.400
this.
They said, "Look.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.840
I know my mom and dad had a
huge role in my life.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.032
That's why I'm so happy and
successful," then other people

01:03:44.032 --> 01:03:47.000
said, "That's why I'm so
miserable and screwed up,"

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.850
but either way blame it on Mom
and Dad or thank Mom and Dad.

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:56.197
And you might think you know.
When you become famous and you

01:03:56.197 --> 01:03:59.133
stand up and you get your awards
maybe you'll thank your mom and

01:03:59.133 --> 01:04:00.884
dad.
When you go to your therapist

01:04:00.884 --> 01:04:03.536
and explain why you're so
screwed up maybe you'll blame

01:04:03.536 --> 01:04:05.633
Dad.
"He never took me to a baseball

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:07.330
game."
Well, maybe,

01:04:07.330 --> 01:04:10.690
[laughter]
but you don't know.

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:15.567
Were you adopted?
If you weren't adopted,

01:04:15.567 --> 01:04:18.383
you can't even begin to have
the conversation about how your

01:04:18.383 --> 01:04:21.343
parents messed you up because if
you're a lot like your parents

01:04:21.343 --> 01:04:24.159
you might be a lot like your
parents because you share their

01:04:24.159 --> 01:04:26.164
genes.
Of course, you resemble your

01:04:26.164 --> 01:04:28.556
parents.
Moreover, how do you figure out

01:04:28.556 --> 01:04:31.320
which is the cause and which is
the effect?

01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.504
"Mom smacked me a lot and
that's why I turned out to be

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:37.228
such a rotten person."
Well, maybe she smacked you

01:04:37.228 --> 01:04:39.401
because you were rotten.
[laughter]

01:04:39.401 --> 01:04:45.074
I don't want to get personal
but it's very difficult to pull

01:04:45.074 --> 01:04:48.720
these things apart.
A final point on this.

01:04:51.969 --> 01:04:55.380
One response to Harris' book is
this.

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:57.554
"Look.
Even if this is true,

01:04:57.554 --> 01:05:01.471
you shouldn't let this get out
because if parents don't mold

01:05:01.471 --> 01:05:05.256
their children's personalities
maybe why should they treat

01:05:05.256 --> 01:05:08.829
their kids nicely?"
And you might be wondering this.

01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:12.220
You might be thinking,
well, gee, if you don't have

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:16.086
any effect on how your kids turn
out, why be nice to them,

01:05:16.086 --> 01:05:19.284
but there are answers.
You might want to be nice to

01:05:19.284 --> 01:05:22.017
them because you love them.
You might want to be nice to

01:05:22.017 --> 01:05:23.869
them because you want them to be
happy.

01:05:23.869 --> 01:05:26.907
You might want to be nice to
them because you want to have

01:05:26.907 --> 01:05:29.973
good relationships with them.
And I have a little bit more

01:05:29.973 --> 01:05:32.950
but I'm going to skip it and I'm
going to move right to your

01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:34.931
reading response,
which is very,

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:36.805
very simple,
easy to answer,

01:05:36.805 --> 01:05:39.789
easy to grade:
Explain the Flynn effect.

01:05:39.789 --> 01:05:42.830
It's a toughie so just explain
that.

01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:46.950
Okay.
Have a wonderful spring break

01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:49.000

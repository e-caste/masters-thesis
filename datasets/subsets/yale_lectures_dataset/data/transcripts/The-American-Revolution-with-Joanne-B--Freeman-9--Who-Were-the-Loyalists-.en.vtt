00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.620
Prof: Today we're
talking about Loyalists,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.919
and in doing so we're going to
be talking about the range of

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.770
responses to the building crisis
in British America.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.672
So basically over the course of
the first few lectures here,

00:00:18.672 --> 00:00:22.310
we've looked at the logic
behind some British policy;

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.610
we've looked at the logic of
resistance.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.385
Now we're seeing a little
momentum of resistance building

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:31.452
up,
so now also we need to look at

00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:34.445
people who maybe are not as
eager to resist against the

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:37.440
British government,
and these are the Loyalists.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.557
And it's going to seem sort of
opposite as to what I ought to

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:43.316
be doing at this moment,
but before we launch into

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:46.353
looking at the Loyalists I
actually want to go back for a

00:00:46.353 --> 00:00:48.740
moment to the First Continental
Congress.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.158
Partly because,
as you'll hear when I'm talking

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:54.406
about it,
it's actually the debates and

00:00:54.406 --> 00:01:00.000
proceedings and outcome of this
First Continental Congress that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.060
really helps crystallize matters
because,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.019
as we'll see,
it really is 1774,1775 where

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:08.790
you begin to have people who
kind of identify themselves as

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.459
Loyalists.
 

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.726
And partly because,
as you'll see,

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:15.778
even in the First Continental
Congress itself there actually

00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:17.769
were a range of opinions.
 

00:01:17.769 --> 00:01:21.593
Not everybody in the Congress
agreed on the level of what

00:01:21.593 --> 00:01:22.959
needed to be done.
 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:26.784
So it's not as though in 1774
you had a blob of Patriot and

00:01:26.784 --> 00:01:28.500
then a blob of Loyalist.
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.970
You had a spectrum of opinions
throughout society.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.601
So let's look first at the
First Continental Congress in a

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:39.915
little bit more detail here,
just at the start of the

00:01:39.915 --> 00:01:40.680
lecture.
 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.050
And as I mentioned when I last
discussed the Congress,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.190
it wasn't only composed of
radicals though,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.565
as I'll discuss in a moment,
just the simple fact that this

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:55.300
Congress was called was a pretty
bold action.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.995
But even so,
there was a range of opinions

00:01:57.995 --> 00:01:59.970
represented in the Congress.
 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.909
So there were some more radical
types present--

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.932
so you did have people like
Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry

00:02:05.932 --> 00:02:08.133
there,
and already these people are

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.908
radical in their thoughts,
they're already pondering the

00:02:10.908 --> 00:02:12.917
possibility of war--
you'll hear from Patrick Henry

00:02:12.917 --> 00:02:15.569
in a moment--
but there were also moderates

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.068
there who were more in favor of
reconciliation or reform and who

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:23.923
hoped that the meeting of the
Congress would maybe show

00:02:23.923 --> 00:02:28.348
Parliament that the colonies
were united and determined,

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:31.983
and that maybe the simple fact
that it met would inspire

00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:34.889
Parliament to modify some of its
policies.

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.029
And as we'll see,
it ends up being that those who

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:41.431
were more radical in their
leanings ultimately have a

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:44.897
slight majority in this
Continental Congress and so in

00:02:44.897 --> 00:02:47.580
the end they actually win the
day,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.572
but it isn't obvious that
that's going to be the case at

00:02:50.572 --> 00:02:51.280
the outset.
 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.525
Now the delegates to this
Congress met in Philadelphia in

00:02:55.525 --> 00:02:58.330
the beginning of September in
1774.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.927
There were 55 men present and,
as I mentioned before,

00:03:01.927 --> 00:03:05.802
most of them had some kind of
experience with politics in

00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:07.878
their individual colonies.
 

00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:11.449
Now if you do think about the
fact that this Congress existed,

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:16.050
just calling it into existence
was something of a radical act,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.949
because if you think about it,
this is a colonial congress,

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:24.473
a self-appointed congress that
granted itself power of some

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:27.750
kind over all of the colonies
and even,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.914
as we're about to see,
passed something that was in

00:03:30.914 --> 00:03:34.396
the equivalent of legislation
that applied to all of the

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:35.220
colonies.
 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.598
So in a sense that's a pretty
radical gesture.

00:03:38.598 --> 00:03:43.699
And I found actually a satire
written in 1774 that does a good

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:48.548
job I think of showing how the
Congress did seem radical to

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:52.979
some and how to some it did not
represent happy,

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.185
good things that were about to
happen but actually represented

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:56.740
something frightening and out of
control.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.190
And it's--Actually,
it's a broadside,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.973
so it was a single sheet,
and this is a satire so it was

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:06.099
meant to be making fun of people
who were just elected to the

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:07.818
Continental Congress.
 

00:04:07.818 --> 00:04:10.632
This is actually from New York
and it came out just after New

00:04:10.632 --> 00:04:13.163
York had decided who was going
to go to the Continental

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:14.430
Congress from New York.
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.891
So these are people who were
just making fun of the whole

00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:18.649
idea of having a Continental
Congress.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.829
So it's a broadside and it's
made to look like a very formal

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:26.290
series of resolutions,
and actually it's titled

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.745
"A Meeting of the True Sons
of Liberty,"

00:04:29.745 --> 00:04:32.831
and I--
after class I'll post a link to

00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:33.139
it.
 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.083
It's actually,
as is everything these days,

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.860
digitized so that you can
actually see what it looks like.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.196
So the broadside--series of
resolutions, it reads:

00:04:41.196 --> 00:04:42.490
"Number one.
 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.117
Resolved, That in this general
Time of resolving,

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:47.579
we have as good a right to
resolve as the most

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:48.620
resolute."
 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.942
Okay.
 

00:04:48.942 --> 00:04:51.583
[laughter]
This is not a serious series of

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:52.550
resolutions.
 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:53.468
"Number two.
 

00:04:53.468 --> 00:04:56.170
Resolved: That we have the
whole Sense of the City,

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.225
County, Province,
and all the Colonies,

00:04:58.225 --> 00:05:00.550
concentrated in our own
Persons."

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.184
Again something that's not
thrilling the people writing

00:05:03.184 --> 00:05:04.160
these resolutions.
 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.086
Number three.
 

00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:07.800
"Resolved:
That these Resolves,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.470
and any we may afterward see
fit to promulgate,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.235
shall be approved by all
sensible and good Men in our

00:05:13.235 --> 00:05:15.444
Parent Country;
and that [they shall]

00:05:15.444 --> 00:05:17.620
even make that ungracious
Varlet,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.016
Lord North--"
"Varlet"

00:05:19.016 --> 00:05:21.189
is one of those words you don't
get to say very often.

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:22.800
It made me really happy to type
it today.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.370
[laughs]--that ungracious
Varlet, Lord North,

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.745
it will make him "shake in
his Shoes (when he sees them)

00:05:29.745 --> 00:05:31.490
and split his Breeches."
 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.851
Okay.
 

00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:35.480
The eternal joke of people
splitting their pants.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.379
That dates back to 1774 and
practically earlier.

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.660
I would assume it goes earlier
than that, the eternal joke.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.639
So Lord North will shake in his
shoes;

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.509
it will make him split his
breeches.

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.112
Resolve number four:
"That any Act or Acts of

00:05:49.112 --> 00:05:52.139
Parliament which prevent the
Colonies from triumphing over

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.692
the Liberties,
sporting with the goods or at

00:05:54.692 --> 00:05:57.620
Will claiming the Properties of
the British Ministry,

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.129
is a cruel Oppression in which
all the Colonies are intimately

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.819
concerned.
 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:02.497
Resolved ...
 

00:06:02.497 --> 00:06:05.887
.That the Non-Payment of Debts
contracted with England is the

00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:09.278
only Way to save the Credit of
those who have no Money to pay

00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:10.860
their Debts with."
 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.100
Okay.
 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.987
So that's attacking the logic
of people who don't want to pay

00:06:13.987 --> 00:06:14.420
taxes.
 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.470
Well, they just don't have
money and they don't feel like

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.800
paying.
 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.317
Resolved: "That the best
Way of approving our Loyalty,

00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:21.529
is to spit in the...
 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.115
King's face;
as the means of opening his

00:06:24.115 --> 00:06:24.860
Eyes."
 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.879
Okay, and then finally, lastly:
Resolved: "That every Man,

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.845
Woman or Child,
who doth not agree with our

00:06:31.845 --> 00:06:34.190
Sentiments,
whether he, she or they

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.870
understand them or not,
is an Enemy to his Country,

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.709
wheresoever he was born...
 

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:42.964
,whatever he may think of it;
and that he ought at least to

00:06:42.964 --> 00:06:44.923
be tarred and feathered,
if not hanged,

00:06:44.923 --> 00:06:46.788
drawn and quartered;
all Statutes,

00:06:46.788 --> 00:06:49.134
Laws and Ordinances whatsoever
to the contrary

00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:50.440
notwithstanding."
 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:50.860
Okay.
 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.980
[laughs]
So that satire clearly throws

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.290
within it a slew of accusations
against this pending Continental

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.470
Congress.
 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.774
You can see that it's being
accused of being arbitrary,

00:07:03.774 --> 00:07:07.079
of promoting lawlessness,
of having a lack of tolerance

00:07:07.079 --> 00:07:09.649
for anybody who feels any
differently;

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:12.800
that it's being accused of
displaying a lack of respect or

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.399
gratitude towards the mother
country, maybe even

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.596
vindictiveness;
and--as it was clear in that

00:07:18.596 --> 00:07:19.985
first,
"We resolve to be

00:07:19.985 --> 00:07:21.540
resolving in this time of
resolving"--

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.173
they're also accusing it of
having a stupid amount of

00:07:24.173 --> 00:07:25.439
self-importance,
right?

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:27.600
Continental Congress, harrumph.
 

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:27.803
Sure.
 

00:07:27.803 --> 00:07:29.519
Go have your little Continental
Congress.

00:07:29.519 --> 00:07:33.115
So any of the reasons would
have been part of the reasoning

00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:36.896
why someone might have felt that
this Continental Congress was

00:07:36.896 --> 00:07:40.740
not only not a good idea but
potentially a dangerous idea.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:43.718
So for one reason or another,
people clearly found the

00:07:43.718 --> 00:07:46.980
calling of the Continental
Congress somewhat remarkable.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.889
So the Congress' first meeting
was on September 5,

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.069
and one of the first things
that they had to debate,

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:57.718
logically enough,
is how the Congress is going to

00:07:57.718 --> 00:07:59.009
vote on issues.
 

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:02.043
Should voting be based on the
population of each colony,

00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:04.802
which obviously gives bigger
colonies an advantage,

00:08:04.802 --> 00:08:07.009
or should each colony have one
vote?

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:08.120
The eternal question.
 

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.971
Obviously, this is going to
come back and hit us with a

00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:13.350
vengeance at the Constitutional
Convention.

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.500
Student: How did they
vote on that?

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.238
Prof: How'd they--
[laughs]

00:08:16.238 --> 00:08:18.610
Oh, that's one of those
question-in-a-question

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.350
questions.
 

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.428
That's--I have not gone to look
at the record to see formally

00:08:22.428 --> 00:08:24.019
how they voted on the voting.
 

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:27.434
I would assume they voted by
person, but I will have to

00:08:27.434 --> 00:08:30.660
actually look that up to tell
you how they voted.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:32.712
The question was how do you
vote on how you're going to

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:32.980
vote?
 

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.990
[laughs]
That's a really good question.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.597
I will come in next time and
tell you the answer to that

00:08:38.597 --> 00:08:39.320
question.
 

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.159
I had not considered that
before.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:42.610
Okay. How do you vote on voting?
 

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:42.914
Okay.
 

00:08:42.914 --> 00:08:46.279
So however you vote on voting,
that was one of the first

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:49.731
things that they had to debate--
was how voting was going to

00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:52.698
work, and as I said it's going
to come back and smack us again

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.450
in the Constitutional
Convention.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.501
Now this whole debate--voting
on voting--tried the patience of

00:09:00.501 --> 00:09:02.090
Patrick Henry.
 

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.291
Okay.
 

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:03.863
Patrick Henry,
obviously one of the more

00:09:03.863 --> 00:09:06.080
radical members of this First
Continental Congress,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.575
really impatient at the idea
that they're dilly-dallying

00:09:09.575 --> 00:09:12.498
about voting and how to
calculate population of

00:09:12.498 --> 00:09:13.960
different colonies.
 

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.058
So this is what Henry said in a
burst of frustration.

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.528
"Government is dissolved
...

00:09:20.528 --> 00:09:23.058
We are in a state of nature,
Sir ....

00:09:23.058 --> 00:09:26.035
The distinctions between
Virginians, Pennsylvanians,

00:09:26.035 --> 00:09:27.846
New Yorkers,
and New Englanders,

00:09:27.846 --> 00:09:28.778
are no more.
 

00:09:28.778 --> 00:09:31.600
I am not a Virginian but an
American."

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.820
Clearly, he has a real talent
for the bold statement,

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.602
the memorable bold statement--I
am not a Virginian but an

00:09:37.602 --> 00:09:39.693
American--
kind of not as famous as the

00:09:39.693 --> 00:09:42.629
liberty or death thing but still
clearly really bold,

00:09:42.629 --> 00:09:44.399
also clearly referring to the
logic,

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.460
John Locke, social contract.
 

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.389
Just by saying that we're in a
state of nature,

00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:52.144
Henry is basically saying that
the social contract between the

00:09:52.144 --> 00:09:54.668
colonies and the Crown has been
broken.

00:09:54.668 --> 00:09:57.264
Clearly, he's one of the more
radical members of Congress,

00:09:57.264 --> 00:10:00.130
so everybody wouldn't hear what
he said and stand up and applaud

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.860
and line up.
 

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.972
'Yes, we're in a state of
nature.

00:10:02.972 --> 00:10:03.370
Go.'
 

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.312
He's an extreme,
but in fact you can see

00:10:06.312 --> 00:10:10.613
throughout the Continental
Congress tension between a real

00:10:10.613 --> 00:10:12.500
spectrum of opinions.
 

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.788
There were militant members
really promoting resistance,

00:10:15.788 --> 00:10:18.840
even already kind of thinking
maybe war is on the horizon,

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.240
and then there were more
moderate members promoting

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.370
reconciliation or maybe reform
of some kind.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:29.192
And you can see the push of the
more militant members and the

00:10:29.192 --> 00:10:32.568
sort of debate between the
different kinds of opinions

00:10:32.568 --> 00:10:36.519
almost immediately within the
first few weeks of meeting,

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:39.283
with the arrival of what came
to be called the Suffolk

00:10:39.283 --> 00:10:42.052
Resolves--
Suffolk, Massachusetts,

00:10:42.052 --> 00:10:43.450
S-u-f-f-o-l-k.
 

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.474
And again--obviously Suffolk,
Massachusetts--not

00:10:46.474 --> 00:10:48.982
surprisingly,
these what you will see as

00:10:48.982 --> 00:10:52.779
being very bold resolutions
originate in Massachusetts.

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:56.870
But they were not introduced by
Massachusetts delegates.

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.668
This is something John Adams
does later too.

00:10:58.668 --> 00:11:03.470
Because Massachusetts is such a
radical colony people--

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.542
delegates from Massachusetts
know that they had better not be

00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:09.359
the ones to promote anything
that sounds radical because

00:11:09.359 --> 00:11:11.509
everybody will immediately
dismiss it.

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:13.961
So in this case the
Massachusetts delegates know if

00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:16.710
they come forward and say,
'We brought these resolves;

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.392
we want you to consider them,'
people would probably assume

00:11:19.392 --> 00:11:22.110
that they were too extreme,
but if they appear to come from

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.000
Massachusetts to the Continental
Congress,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.658
well, then that becomes
something that people will be

00:11:26.658 --> 00:11:28.038
more open to considering.
 

00:11:28.038 --> 00:11:32.859
So this set of resolves was
sent to the Congress supposedly

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:35.520
from Suffolk County,
Massachusetts,

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.399
which is I guess Boston's
county,

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:39.529
and they became known as the
Suffolk Resolves,

00:11:39.529 --> 00:11:43.940
so here is a list of some of
the things that these declared.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.298
Okay.
 

00:11:44.298 --> 00:11:48.673
Number one: They declared the
Intolerable Acts or the Coercive

00:11:48.673 --> 00:11:50.767
Acts--
however you want to refer to

00:11:50.767 --> 00:11:53.558
them--as being unconstitutional
and not to be obeyed.

00:11:53.558 --> 00:11:58.259
Number two: They said that
Massachusetts--

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:00.908
which you remember that their
government had been dissolved,

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:03.432
things had been changed because
of everything that had been

00:12:03.432 --> 00:12:06.287
going on in Boston--
Massachusetts should create a

00:12:06.287 --> 00:12:09.950
new assembly for itself to
collect all colonial taxes and

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.285
withhold them from the Crown
until the Massachusetts

00:12:13.285 --> 00:12:17.668
government had been restored to
its constitutional foundation.

00:12:17.668 --> 00:12:21.206
Number three:
The resolves advised people to

00:12:21.206 --> 00:12:26.061
arm themselves and form their
own militia in preparation for

00:12:26.061 --> 00:12:30.009
resisting the possibility of
British attack.

00:12:30.009 --> 00:12:33.457
Number four:
They proposed that the jailing

00:12:33.457 --> 00:12:38.220
of any patriot leader gave
people the right to jail British

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:39.370
officials.
 

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.600
And then finally,
they recommended stringent

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.379
economic sanctions against
Britain.

00:12:45.379 --> 00:12:45.638
Okay.
 

00:12:45.638 --> 00:12:48.477
Clearly, those are really
radical resolutions on a bunch

00:12:48.477 --> 00:12:49.149
of levels.
 

00:12:49.149 --> 00:12:52.289
Now they were proposed;
they were read;

00:12:52.289 --> 00:12:54.240
they were presented.
 

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:58.011
Some in the Continental
Congress applauded them but they

00:12:58.011 --> 00:13:01.509
were not initially acted on for
obvious reasons,

00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:04.620
because they made a lot of
delegates extremely nervous.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:10.070
As delegate Joseph Galloway of
Pennsylvania said,

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.650
the Suffolk Resolves,
quote, "contained a

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.690
complete declaration of war
against Great Britain."

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.041
Okay.
 

00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:16.009
They seemed pretty extreme.
 

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:20.672
Galloway was typical of many
who felt that just failing to

00:13:20.672 --> 00:13:25.823
recognize Parliament's right to
regulate trade didn't accomplish

00:13:25.823 --> 00:13:28.423
anything,
and as a matter of fact he

00:13:28.423 --> 00:13:31.110
wasn't even sure that that was
right in theory.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:35.589
So Galloway at this moment came
up with his own suggestion about

00:13:35.589 --> 00:13:37.580
the best course of action.
 

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.970
And although in comparison with
the really radical Suffolk

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.538
Resolves his suggestions are
going to sound conservative,

00:13:44.538 --> 00:13:48.320
he actually are promoting ideas
that in and of themselves,

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.149
as you'll hear, are radical.
 

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:55.364
So basically Galloway tries to
come up with a way to change the

00:13:55.364 --> 00:13:59.033
basis of the relationship
between the American colonies

00:13:59.033 --> 00:14:00.870
and the mother country.
 

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:05.138
And so he suggests a new plan
of union that he thinks are

00:14:05.138 --> 00:14:08.950
going to--it's going to settle
the whole matter.

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:14.591
So Galloway's plan of union
suggested forming a separate

00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:16.950
American legislature.
 

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.619
He called it,
I think, the Grand Council,

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:22.889
and it would be elected by
colonial assemblies.

00:14:22.889 --> 00:14:27.071
And individual colonies would
continue to govern their own

00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:30.885
internal affairs and the Grand
Council would regulate

00:14:30.885 --> 00:14:34.263
commercial,
civil and criminal matters that

00:14:34.263 --> 00:14:37.389
affected the colonies generally
as a whole.

00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:41.385
Now according to Galloway's
plan, this Grand Council could

00:14:41.385 --> 00:14:45.700
veto parliamentary legislation--
clearly that's a pretty bold

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.307
gesture--
but still it would be inferior

00:14:48.307 --> 00:14:51.149
to Parliament,
which could still initiate

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:53.808
legislation relevant to the
colonies.

00:14:53.808 --> 00:14:58.092
In essence the Grand Council
would be kind of an inferior

00:14:58.092 --> 00:15:00.769
branch of the British
Parliament.

00:15:00.769 --> 00:15:04.542
And the great principle behind
Galloway's plan was,

00:15:04.542 --> 00:15:08.691
quote, "that no law should
bind America without her

00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:10.048
consent."
 

00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:14.229
So that's really what he's
trying to do here is devise a

00:15:14.229 --> 00:15:18.559
way for the colonists to consent
to what's being passed in

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:19.700
Parliament.
 

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.317
Now interestingly,
the vote over Galloway's plan

00:15:23.317 --> 00:15:27.399
of union was close but it was
ultimately defeated,

00:15:27.399 --> 00:15:30.905
and I suppose looking back in
the long view of time it

00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:34.875
probably wasn't likely that the
British government would have

00:15:34.875 --> 00:15:38.315
approved of the creation of a
kind of second colonial

00:15:38.315 --> 00:15:39.440
parliament.
 

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.938
And, as we'll see,
that's unlikely particularly

00:15:41.938 --> 00:15:44.928
when you look later at how
Parliament responded to these

00:15:44.928 --> 00:15:48.090
continental congresses,
and in a sense you could say

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:51.604
the Continental Congress was a
sort of temporary version of a

00:15:51.604 --> 00:15:52.600
Grand Council.
 

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.032
So the fact that Parliament
wasn't too keen on that would

00:15:55.032 --> 00:15:57.464
suggest they wouldn't be very
excited about a little baby

00:15:57.464 --> 00:16:00.389
colonial parliament--
branch of Parliament being

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:01.308
established.
 

00:16:01.308 --> 00:16:05.113
Even so, Galloway later
declared that his plan lost due

00:16:05.113 --> 00:16:07.860
to what he called the violent
party,

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.149
and he felt the violent party
was in control of the

00:16:11.149 --> 00:16:14.764
Continental Congress,
and in a sense he was right

00:16:14.764 --> 00:16:19.740
because the more radical members
did have a very slight majority.

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.745
And the defeat of Galloway's
plan actually ended up

00:16:23.745 --> 00:16:28.312
mobilizing these more radical
members because it suggested

00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:33.038
that the moderates didn't have
the power to accomplish their

00:16:33.038 --> 00:16:34.000
goals.
 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.259
So with this new burst of
confidence in their strength,

00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:40.580
with the defeat of Galloway's
plan,

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:46.565
these radicals proposed and
passed the Suffolk Resolves on

00:16:46.565 --> 00:16:48.350
October 8,1774.
 

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:50.019
So they actually passed them.
 

00:16:50.019 --> 00:16:54.014
To many in Congress,
this seemed like an incredibly

00:16:54.014 --> 00:16:57.210
bold act of unity among the
colonies,

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.820
and even though the individual
resolves were radical,

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.945
to many what they noticed most
of all was that it appeared to

00:17:03.945 --> 00:17:05.038
be an act of unity.
 

00:17:05.038 --> 00:17:08.134
In a sense it was responding to
Massachusetts and to

00:17:08.134 --> 00:17:11.778
Massachusetts' plight with an
action that would affect all of

00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:12.808
the colonies.
 

00:17:12.808 --> 00:17:15.567
As John Adams put it,
"This day convinced me

00:17:15.567 --> 00:17:17.348
that America will support ...
 

00:17:17.348 --> 00:17:20.696
Massachusetts or perish with
her," so he took it like

00:17:20.696 --> 00:17:23.692
many others as a really
interesting sign of colonial

00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:24.278
unity.
 

00:17:24.278 --> 00:17:27.900
Now of course not everybody had
such a thrilled reaction to the

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.009
Suffolk Resolves.
 

00:17:29.009 --> 00:17:32.675
One completely baffled Loyalist
observer said that he could only

00:17:32.675 --> 00:17:35.992
explain the acceptance of the
Suffolk Resolves by assuming

00:17:35.992 --> 00:17:38.741
that the delegates,
quote, "came into this

00:17:38.741 --> 00:17:41.798
vote immediately after drinking
thirty-two bumpers of the best

00:17:41.798 --> 00:17:42.650
Madeira."
 

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.006
Okay.
 

00:17:43.006 --> 00:17:45.288
They just must have been drunk.
 

00:17:45.288 --> 00:17:47.430
[laughs]
There is no other explanation.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.880
This makes no sense.
 

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.251
[laughs]
The eternal explanation for all

00:17:51.251 --> 00:17:54.720
of history: I guess they must
have been drunk or crazy.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.105
Okay.
 

00:17:55.105 --> 00:17:59.593
So clearly, a sure sign here
that the colonies are not just

00:17:59.593 --> 00:18:01.759
going to be backing down.
 

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:07.670
Six days later on October 14,
Congress approved the

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.900
Declaration and Resolves--
and they had agonized over that

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.440
for a month so they didn't just
pass it;

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.440
they actually had been
pondering it all along.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.722
And the Declaration and
Resolves actually represented

00:18:21.722 --> 00:18:26.336
one of the goals of this
Continental Congress--to write a

00:18:26.336 --> 00:18:29.548
clear statement of colonial
rights.

00:18:29.548 --> 00:18:34.154
However, this was not as easy
as it might sound because

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:38.759
America was pretty much
following an uncharted path.

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:42.435
Never before in Western history
had colonies dared to rebel

00:18:42.435 --> 00:18:45.480
against the mother country in
quite this way,

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.038
so now they had to somehow put
on paper a way to justify it.

00:18:49.038 --> 00:18:52.308
Why were they doing this and as
important--

00:18:52.308 --> 00:18:54.210
actually in a sense maybe more
important--

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:58.669
could all of the colonies agree
on the specifics of colonial

00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:59.348
rights?
 

00:18:59.348 --> 00:19:02.576
Could they actually even sit
down and make a statement that

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:03.798
everybody agreed on?
 

00:19:03.798 --> 00:19:07.928
And the difficulties that the
delegates had in writing this

00:19:07.928 --> 00:19:12.127
draft really demonstrates once
again how really difficult it

00:19:12.127 --> 00:19:16.398
was to define the precise terms
of the colonies' problem with

00:19:16.398 --> 00:19:20.090
the mother country,
the precise terms for the

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.880
proper relationship between the
colonies and the mother country.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.358
Even when they sat down to do
it--'Okay.

00:19:27.358 --> 00:19:29.167
Here we are,
the committee in the First

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:31.684
Continental Congress,
and we're going to form the

00:19:31.684 --> 00:19:34.637
Declaration and Resolves and
write down the reasons for our

00:19:34.637 --> 00:19:35.250
actions.'
 

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.386
Even with such deliberate
desire on their part,

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:42.068
it was difficult for them to
commit this to writing.

00:19:42.068 --> 00:19:43.632
It was difficult for them to
find the right words and to

00:19:43.632 --> 00:19:43.858
agree.
 

00:19:43.858 --> 00:19:48.188
And the Declaration and
Resolves was drafted by a

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.269
committee.
 

00:19:49.269 --> 00:19:52.351
John Adams was on the committee
--which is good because then he

00:19:52.351 --> 00:19:55.482
gets to tell us afterwards about
the creation of the Declaration

00:19:55.482 --> 00:19:58.365
and Resolves because he always
likes to explain his role in

00:19:58.365 --> 00:20:01.150
every important moment of the
American Revolution.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:02.618
So he was there.
 

00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:06.818
And the committee ended up
basically stating in their draft

00:20:06.818 --> 00:20:10.800
that the Declaration and
Resolves were going to be based

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.250
on three things.
 

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:15.010
Their explanation for what was
going on in the colonies was

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.153
going to be based on three
things: Number one,

00:20:17.153 --> 00:20:19.936
the laws of nature;
number two, the principles of

00:20:19.936 --> 00:20:23.102
the English constitution;
and number three,

00:20:23.102 --> 00:20:26.019
the charters of the colonies.
 

00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:29.308
So all of those things,
the laws of nature,

00:20:29.308 --> 00:20:31.108
the principles of the English
constitution,

00:20:31.108 --> 00:20:34.234
the charters of the colonies,
all of those things were cited

00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:36.460
as justification for what was
going on,

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.849
but in a sense the real basis
of what was coming out here in

00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:43.108
the Declaration and Resolves--
and so in a sense what they

00:20:43.108 --> 00:20:46.855
were really most grounded on--
was going to be their sense of

00:20:46.855 --> 00:20:50.200
rights as English subjects,
the power of Parliament.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.365
It was really going to be their
understanding of the English

00:20:53.365 --> 00:20:54.170
constitution.
 

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.069
And you can hear how important
this particular fact was to them

00:20:58.069 --> 00:21:01.530
just in looking at the list of
colonial rights that they

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:04.740
included in this declaration as
being violated.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.298
So they listed that the right
of assembly was being violated,

00:21:08.298 --> 00:21:10.971
the right of petition,
the right to be tried by a jury

00:21:10.971 --> 00:21:13.183
of their peers,
the right to be free of a

00:21:13.183 --> 00:21:16.013
standing army,
the right to choose their own

00:21:16.013 --> 00:21:16.838
assemblies.
 

00:21:16.838 --> 00:21:19.910
All of these things are really
basic English constitutional

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.191
rights that these colonists are
starting they feel they've been

00:21:23.191 --> 00:21:23.880
violated.
 

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:28.330
As John Adams later explained,
the biggest challenge in

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:33.358
drafting the declaration was in
describing what he called,

00:21:33.358 --> 00:21:35.068
quote, "the authority of
Parliament."

00:21:35.068 --> 00:21:37.785
What he said was the authority
of Parliament was "indeed

00:21:37.785 --> 00:21:39.548
the essence of the whole
controversy;

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:42.779
some were for a flat denial of
all authority;

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:46.558
others for denying the power of
taxation only;

00:21:46.558 --> 00:21:49.788
some for denying internal,
but admitting external,

00:21:49.788 --> 00:21:50.910
taxation."
 

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.160
So even within this little
committee--

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.279
there's only a few people on
the committee--

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:57.013
even there, there are all these
opinions on exactly what's

00:21:57.013 --> 00:21:59.844
supposed to be happening in the
relationship with the mother

00:21:59.844 --> 00:22:00.420
country.
 

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.494
And as Adams puts it,
"After a multitude of

00:22:02.494 --> 00:22:04.811
motions had been made,
discussed, negatived,

00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:08.220
it seemed as if we should never
agree upon anything."

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.838
So they just can't state what
their resolves are.

00:22:10.838 --> 00:22:13.808
However, ultimately they
managed to do it.

00:22:13.808 --> 00:22:17.950
John Adams did a lot towards
contributing one particular

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.317
article in this document that
said Parliament could not tax

00:22:22.317 --> 00:22:24.419
them,
but the colonies would

00:22:24.419 --> 00:22:27.607
"cheerfully"
submit to bona fide regulation

00:22:27.607 --> 00:22:29.079
of external commerce.
 

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:32.380
So we have two things. Right.
 

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.548
We have the Suffolk Resolves.
 

00:22:33.548 --> 00:22:35.400
We have the Declaration and
Resolves.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.365
The Continental Congress also
drafted a petition to the King

00:22:39.365 --> 00:22:43.184
and it was a restrained--
it was a respectful petition

00:22:43.184 --> 00:22:47.482
basically trying to inform the
King of the evil plot hatching

00:22:47.482 --> 00:22:51.279
in Parliament to rob the
colonies of their rights.

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:53.750
The petition warned the King
that there were,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.935
quote, "designing and
dangerous men"

00:22:56.935 --> 00:22:59.843
in Parliament,
and that they were trying to

00:22:59.843 --> 00:23:03.130
intervene between the King and
his faithful subjects.

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:07.161
Now clearly you can hear at
this point, the focus here is on

00:23:07.161 --> 00:23:08.048
Parliament.
 

00:23:08.048 --> 00:23:11.256
By petitioning the King,
this Congress is suggesting

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:15.470
that the King is really still a
figure who can be reasoned with,

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.127
that the King is someone who
they're appealing to in person

00:23:18.127 --> 00:23:20.098
to help with the problem with
Parliament.

00:23:20.098 --> 00:23:20.434
Okay.
 

00:23:20.434 --> 00:23:23.250
Suffolk Resolves,
Declaration and Resolves,

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.858
petition to the King.
 

00:23:24.858 --> 00:23:30.469
The final thing that the
Congress did was agree on a way

00:23:30.469 --> 00:23:35.567
to secure the repeal of all
offensive parliamentary

00:23:35.567 --> 00:23:37.200
legislation.
 

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.354
And they decided to do this in
the way that they had always

00:23:40.354 --> 00:23:43.126
protested British attacks on
their rights--surprise,

00:23:43.126 --> 00:23:44.540
surprise--non-importation.
 

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.140
Right?
 

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.108
They think that always works,
non-importation;

00:23:47.108 --> 00:23:48.769
we're going back to
non-importation.

00:23:48.769 --> 00:23:52.776
But this time they decided to
really form a network of local

00:23:52.776 --> 00:23:56.987
non-importation committees and
towns throughout the colonies to

00:23:56.987 --> 00:23:59.500
actually enforce
non-importation.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:03.038
They called their plan the
Continental Association,

00:24:03.038 --> 00:24:07.303
so clearly this is more
ambitious at least in what

00:24:07.303 --> 00:24:11.255
they're suggesting it is,
in their desire for what they

00:24:11.255 --> 00:24:12.038
want it to be.
 

00:24:12.038 --> 00:24:16.278
And as it happened before,
they included in their plan

00:24:16.278 --> 00:24:20.519
localized Committees of
Inspection that would watch to

00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:24.633
see who's violating the boycott,
who's drinking tea,

00:24:24.633 --> 00:24:26.028
who's buying luxuries.
 

00:24:26.028 --> 00:24:31.442
Now, the creation of the
Continental Association didn't

00:24:31.442 --> 00:24:34.750
just encourage non-importation.
 

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:38.144
It actually had a number of
other impacts on the colonies as

00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:41.538
a whole and on sort of what's
developing in the colonies.

00:24:41.538 --> 00:24:45.404
First, by creating the
Continental Association and

00:24:45.404 --> 00:24:49.980
ensuring that it was going to
have a really widespread,

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.801
localized influence,
the Continental Congress

00:24:52.801 --> 00:24:56.713
essentially created a localized
government structure that down

00:24:56.713 --> 00:25:00.241
the road would be vital in
organizing the war effort and

00:25:00.241 --> 00:25:03.000
maintaining order throughout the
war.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.864
So they're creating kind of a
network--just by declaring that

00:25:06.864 --> 00:25:10.019
this exists--that goes
throughout the colonies.

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:14.636
Second, in the process of doing
that the Association brought

00:25:14.636 --> 00:25:19.410
literally thousands of people
into the war effort as committee

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.348
members.
 

00:25:20.348 --> 00:25:25.299
Third, although the Continental
Congress was an unofficial

00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:29.470
congress that didn't have any
real authority,

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.380
by creating the Continental
Association it basically passed

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:37.558
a piece of legislation that
applied throughout the colonies.

00:25:37.558 --> 00:25:40.902
Committees of Inspection
considered themselves the

00:25:40.902 --> 00:25:44.450
enforcement agencies of the
Continental Congress,

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:47.846
not enforcement agencies
of their local colonial

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:51.586
legislature,
and in some colonies committees

00:25:51.586 --> 00:25:55.038
actually created--
I'm sorry--communities actually

00:25:55.038 --> 00:25:57.730
created Committees of Inspection
on their own,

00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:00.470
without even waiting for their
own colonial legislature to ask

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.630
them,
or even for it to meet.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.667
They just knew that this was
happening and communities in and

00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:10.640
of themselves created their own
Committees of Inspection.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.813
And then fourth,
over time as the colonies moved

00:26:13.813 --> 00:26:17.256
into war and as colonial
governments really began to

00:26:17.256 --> 00:26:19.890
falter and run into
complications--

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.911
as the crisis really
magnified--these Committees of

00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:26.355
Inspection were able to step
into the void and assert some

00:26:26.355 --> 00:26:31.200
kind of centralized organized--
hopefully--authority.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:31.605
Okay.
 

00:26:31.605 --> 00:26:36.798
So the Continental Association
went into effect and this time,

00:26:36.798 --> 00:26:39.618
more than any of the previous
attempts at non-importation,

00:26:39.618 --> 00:26:42.878
people really are beginning to
realize that there's a crisis at

00:26:42.878 --> 00:26:45.247
hand,
so more people complied with

00:26:45.247 --> 00:26:47.890
non-importation now than ever
before.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.788
And at times before it had been
successful, but now we actually

00:26:51.788 --> 00:26:54.868
reach a new high of people
complying with this.

00:26:54.868 --> 00:26:59.721
And just one example of this:
In 1774, New York imported

00:26:59.721 --> 00:27:04.750
roughly 437,000 pounds sterling
worth of British goods.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.088
Okay, 437 pounds sterling.
 

00:27:07.088 --> 00:27:10.299
One year later,
1775, in New York this number

00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:13.730
had dropped to roughly 1,000
pounds sterling.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:15.960
Okay. That's huge. Right?
 

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.348
That's real compliance with
non-importation.

00:27:19.348 --> 00:27:24.704
And the Congress' final act was
to agree to meet the following

00:27:24.704 --> 00:27:29.358
spring in May of 1775 if their
grievances had not been

00:27:29.358 --> 00:27:31.730
addressed by that time.
 

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:33.640
So basically they conclude by
saying, 'Okay.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.061
We're going to now give Britain
time to hear what we've

00:27:36.061 --> 00:27:38.708
said--the several months it's
going to take it to get across

00:27:38.708 --> 00:27:39.828
the ocean to England.
 

00:27:39.828 --> 00:27:41.994
They can respond and take
several months to communicate

00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:43.720
back with us and we'll see what
happens,

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.090
and if we haven't been
addressed we will have another

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.618
continental congress in May of
1775.'

00:27:49.618 --> 00:27:53.242
Now as you can imagine,
the adjournment of the First

00:27:53.242 --> 00:27:57.150
Continental Congress left
relations between the colonies

00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:01.200
and the mother country in kind
of a precarious state.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.929
The Congress and its activities
also made it increasingly

00:28:04.929 --> 00:28:08.858
obvious that there were two
sides forming on the question of

00:28:08.858 --> 00:28:12.654
the proper workings of the
imperial system and how best to

00:28:12.654 --> 00:28:15.118
respond to the ongoing problem.
 

00:28:15.118 --> 00:28:18.965
Now all along,
there had been people who had

00:28:18.965 --> 00:28:23.170
more sympathy towards the Crown
than others,

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:26.798
people like Massachusetts
governor Thomas Hutchinson--

00:28:26.798 --> 00:28:30.817
he is now Governor--or like the
people throughout the colonies

00:28:30.817 --> 00:28:34.109
who accepted the position of
stamp distributor,

00:28:34.109 --> 00:28:36.038
for example.
 

00:28:36.038 --> 00:28:40.295
By late 1774 and 1775,
as people really began to take

00:28:40.295 --> 00:28:44.876
sides and warfare began to seem
at least possible to some

00:28:44.876 --> 00:28:47.688
people,
the people who were sympathetic

00:28:47.688 --> 00:28:51.050
to the British administration
began to face some difficult

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:51.700
choices.
 

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.904
Known at this point as the
King's Friends or the Friends of

00:28:55.904 --> 00:28:59.477
Government,
they began to find it more and

00:28:59.477 --> 00:29:03.910
more difficult if not impossible
to remain neutral.

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.858
Thousands of people were
becoming involved in the war

00:29:06.858 --> 00:29:07.368
effort.
 

00:29:07.368 --> 00:29:09.710
Troops, which of course in
Boston they called,

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:12.298
quote, "military
executioners"--

00:29:12.298 --> 00:29:15.308
They had a real flair for
propaganda in Boston.

00:29:15.308 --> 00:29:18.827
Troops, whether you called them
military executioners or not,

00:29:18.827 --> 00:29:21.818
were being sent to America in
increasing numbers.

00:29:21.818 --> 00:29:24.640
So people were beginning to
take sides,

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.226
and those who felt loyal to the
British government had to decide

00:29:28.226 --> 00:29:31.712
on a course of action,
because to not declare your

00:29:31.712 --> 00:29:35.916
loyalty to the protesting
colonists was often as good as

00:29:35.916 --> 00:29:38.440
declaring your enmity to them.
 

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.420
Many Loyalists would soon
declare with some justification

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.548
that by forcing people to sign
oaths--

00:29:43.548 --> 00:29:46.420
like, they were loyal to the
Patriot cause,

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.424
by inspecting people's
purchases to see if they were

00:29:49.424 --> 00:29:53.044
complying with non-importation--
that the Continental

00:29:53.044 --> 00:29:57.726
Association was supposedly
fighting for American liberty by

00:29:57.726 --> 00:30:00.308
curbing individual liberties.
 

00:30:00.308 --> 00:30:02.883
As one Loyalist wrote,
the only liberty that the

00:30:02.883 --> 00:30:06.011
Patriots wanted was the liberty,
quote, "of knocking out

00:30:06.011 --> 00:30:08.567
any Man's Brains that dares
presume to speak his Mind freely

00:30:08.567 --> 00:30:10.038
upon the present Contest."
 

00:30:10.038 --> 00:30:10.309
Okay.
 

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:13.121
These are people who are
beginning to feel irked that

00:30:13.121 --> 00:30:16.038
there seems to be a majority
building in some way,

00:30:16.038 --> 00:30:18.857
certainly a loud group of
people expressing anger and

00:30:18.857 --> 00:30:21.910
resentment and resistance,
and if you don't agree,

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.130
people are beginning to feel
somewhat threatened.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.523
Now traditionally these
Loyalists have often been

00:30:28.523 --> 00:30:32.131
depicted as timid or
conservative men who maybe were

00:30:32.131 --> 00:30:34.960
too afraid to side with the
rebels,

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.180
maybe were afraid to fight the
system,

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.009
or were afraid of losing their
wealth or status,

00:30:41.009 --> 00:30:43.650
but obviously the truth is more
complex than that.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:48.478
Choosing to remain loyal to the
Crown in the midst of a building

00:30:48.478 --> 00:30:51.848
resistant movement was not an
easy choice.

00:30:51.848 --> 00:30:55.751
And ultimately it really
required in some cases some

00:30:55.751 --> 00:30:58.858
degree of bravery,
because it really did put your

00:30:58.858 --> 00:31:00.365
livelihood,
your property,

00:31:00.365 --> 00:31:03.670
and even sometimes your
physical safety at risk because

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.401
it potentially forced you to put
yourself on the opposing side

00:31:07.401 --> 00:31:11.068
from your friends,
sometimes even your family.

00:31:11.068 --> 00:31:13.203
Actually, a couple
of--Actually,

00:31:13.203 --> 00:31:17.788
a good number of years ago,
I had someone write a senior

00:31:17.788 --> 00:31:23.009
essay with me and he found a
diary from roughly this period

00:31:23.009 --> 00:31:26.638
of a person whose family--
he was from New England and I

00:31:26.638 --> 00:31:27.868
don't remember where he was
from--

00:31:27.868 --> 00:31:32.210
his family divided over what to
do.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:34.884
And half of the family felt
like they wanted to remain loyal

00:31:34.884 --> 00:31:37.243
to the Crown and half didn't,
and the diary is really

00:31:37.243 --> 00:31:37.970
fascinating.
 

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.284
It just shows this person
trying to figure out what to do

00:31:40.284 --> 00:31:42.681
and no matter what he does,
actually, members of his family

00:31:42.681 --> 00:31:43.880
are going to cut him off.
 

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.840
And it really--It was a good
senior essay if I do say so

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.923
myself--
but it also was really a

00:31:48.923 --> 00:31:52.587
fascinating diary because it
just really showed one family

00:31:52.587 --> 00:31:55.609
being just torn apart by
increasingly passionate

00:31:55.609 --> 00:31:59.404
political ideas but equally
important by just having to take

00:31:59.404 --> 00:32:03.519
a stand in a community that's
swaying one way or another.

00:32:03.519 --> 00:32:07.480
And you can see what I'm
talking about.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.739
Actually, it's another diary
and this one I have a quote from

00:32:09.739 --> 00:32:12.111
as opposed to the random senior
essay I'm remembering from years

00:32:12.111 --> 00:32:12.450
past.
 

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:15.818
There's a diary of a fellow
named Samuel Curwen.

00:32:15.818 --> 00:32:19.259
He did not describe himself as
a Loyalist.

00:32:19.259 --> 00:32:21.038
He described himself as a,
quote, "moderate

00:32:21.038 --> 00:32:22.769
man"--
and I'm going to come back to

00:32:22.769 --> 00:32:24.471
that too,
that Loyalist and moderate are

00:32:24.471 --> 00:32:27.428
not always the same thing--
but he described himself as a

00:32:27.428 --> 00:32:30.608
moderate man and he said that
until 1775 he lived in

00:32:30.608 --> 00:32:31.670
Massachusetts.
 

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:35.460
Obviously, by 1775 it would be
difficult to be a moderate man,

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:41.048
and in 1775 after Lexington and
Concord,

00:32:41.048 --> 00:32:45.368
Curwen became actually fearful
for his life in that radical

00:32:45.368 --> 00:32:46.038
colony.
 

00:32:46.038 --> 00:32:48.517
So as he put it,
"I left my late peaceful

00:32:48.517 --> 00:32:51.381
home (in my sixtieth
year)," so he's been living

00:32:51.381 --> 00:32:54.740
there for 60 years "in
search of personal security,

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.108
and those rights which by the
laws of God,

00:32:57.108 --> 00:32:59.740
I ought to have enjoyed
undisturbed there."

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.670
So he's a moderate and he feels
actually threatened in

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.380
Massachusetts and he decides he
needs to move,

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.400
so he heads to Philadelphia
hoping,

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.678
as he put it,
"to find an asylum amongst

00:33:10.678 --> 00:33:12.180
Quakers and Dutchmen."
 

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.339
So he's actually seeking out a
population of people who maybe

00:33:15.339 --> 00:33:18.660
aren't going to be as radical as
the people he's coming from.

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:21.957
And he says in his diary that
when he arrived in Philadelphia

00:33:21.957 --> 00:33:25.200
a friend came to meet his boat
at the dock and this friend's

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.542
opening remark--
so the first thing that the

00:33:27.542 --> 00:33:30.058
friend said to him--
was, "We will protect you,

00:33:30.058 --> 00:33:32.880
though you're a Tory,"
and this guy said,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.779
it "embarrassed me not a
little."

00:33:35.779 --> 00:33:35.977
Okay.
 

00:33:35.977 --> 00:33:38.347
So he basically feels like--and
he says this at one point--he

00:33:38.347 --> 00:33:39.848
feels like he has the mark of
Cain.

00:33:39.848 --> 00:33:42.230
No matter where he goes people
are sort of like:

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:43.750
'oh, you're a Tory,
are you?

00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:45.900
Well, we'll protect you because
we like you.'

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.789
And he said he found it very
difficult to find a place to

00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:51.163
stay, to find a boarding house
in Philadelphia,

00:33:51.163 --> 00:33:53.588
because people just refused to
take him in.

00:33:53.588 --> 00:33:56.556
As he put it,
"so many refused as made

00:33:56.556 --> 00:33:59.227
it fearful whether,
like Cain, I had not a

00:33:59.227 --> 00:34:02.165
discouraging mark upon me,
or a strong feature of

00:34:02.165 --> 00:34:04.737
Toryism"--
like somehow people are looking

00:34:04.737 --> 00:34:06.490
at me and saying I look like a
Tory?

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:09.155
Like, how was it that they
weren't giving me any place to

00:34:09.155 --> 00:34:09.489
stay?
 

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:13.391
So that's one person's diary,
but again it shows you how this

00:34:13.391 --> 00:34:16.449
person felt threatened and then
this person,

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:19.414
even having moved to feel
safer, ends up in Philadelphia

00:34:19.414 --> 00:34:22.326
and still feels as though he's
certainly outside of the

00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:25.344
majority and not having an easy
time of it even among his

00:34:25.344 --> 00:34:26.099
friends.
 

00:34:26.099 --> 00:34:31.039
So clearly choosing to remain
loyal to the Crown,

00:34:31.039 --> 00:34:34.730
or even like Curwen just
choosing to be moderate in your

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.233
principles,
could be a really difficult

00:34:37.233 --> 00:34:39.900
choice with some pretty serious
consequences.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:44.605
Now--there were many reasons
why one might choose to remain

00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:47.768
loyal to the Crown or to be
moderate.

00:34:47.768 --> 00:34:50.882
And in a way just sort of using
the term "Loyalist"

00:34:50.882 --> 00:34:53.735
and throwing it around doesn't
do the complexity of this

00:34:53.735 --> 00:34:56.146
justice,
because there were any number

00:34:56.146 --> 00:34:59.621
of reasons why you might not
want to go along with colonial

00:34:59.621 --> 00:35:00.460
resistance.
 

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:04.079
Some people maybe were really
aggressively loyal to the Crown.

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:07.539
Maybe that was where their
actions were coming from.

00:35:07.539 --> 00:35:10.632
Maybe some people just were not
excited about the idea of

00:35:10.632 --> 00:35:13.449
independence and war,
and maybe that would have been

00:35:13.449 --> 00:35:14.829
their breaking point.
 

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:17.715
Some, like the Quakers,
may have been just trying to

00:35:17.715 --> 00:35:20.826
remain neutral or pacifist,
which, as you've just heard,

00:35:20.826 --> 00:35:22.920
could be a difficult thing to
do.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:27.012
And some, probably like this
Curwen, might have just wanted

00:35:27.012 --> 00:35:31.034
to be aloof from the whole
matter and--again--did not find

00:35:31.034 --> 00:35:32.800
that very easy to do.
 

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.500
After the war,
Dr. Benjamin Rush--

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.579
who, as you'll hear in this
little quote,

00:35:39.579 --> 00:35:41.768
was obviously supportive of
colonial resistance--

00:35:41.768 --> 00:35:45.681
explained that to him there had
been four different kinds of

00:35:45.681 --> 00:35:47.670
Torys during the Revolution.
 

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:47.936
Okay.
 

00:35:47.936 --> 00:35:49.800
This is Rush's category of
Tories.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.809
Quote: "There were...
 

00:35:51.809 --> 00:35:55.079
Furious Tories who had recourse
to violence and even to

00:35:55.079 --> 00:35:56.050
arms...."
 

00:35:56.050 --> 00:35:59.699
There were "Writing and
talking Tories"--which I

00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:02.324
always think:
as opposed to the illiterate

00:36:02.324 --> 00:36:03.349
mute Tories?
 

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:05.119
[laughter]
And obviously he's saying,

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:07.530
the ones who were really loud,
okay, but still.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:10.980
So there are furious Tories,
writing and talking Tories,

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:13.501
"Silent but busy
Tories" who are

00:36:13.501 --> 00:36:17.070
"disseminating Tory
pamphlets and newspapers and...

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.610
circulating intelligence,"
and then number four:

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:21.713
"Peaceable and
conscientious Tories who

00:36:21.713 --> 00:36:24.204
patiently submitted to the
measures of the governing

00:36:24.204 --> 00:36:26.329
powers,
and who showed nearly equal

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:29.690
kindness to the distress of both
parties during the war."

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.559
This is Rush's way of looking
at things,

00:36:31.559 --> 00:36:35.110
and clearly that's his own
little eccentric point of view,

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:38.514
but let's talk for a minute
here about what we're talking

00:36:38.514 --> 00:36:41.309
about in the way of numbers,
as far as how many Loyalists

00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:43.474
are there,
what are we talking about

00:36:43.474 --> 00:36:45.250
roughly percentage-wise.
 

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:49.289
Historians estimate that
roughly fifteen to twenty

00:36:49.289 --> 00:36:53.989
percent of white males were
Loyalist by the war's end,

00:36:53.989 --> 00:36:55.518
and in this sense,
when I'm using the word

00:36:55.518 --> 00:36:56.599
"Loyalist"
here,

00:36:56.599 --> 00:37:00.393
I'm actually meaning people who
did something overt to support

00:37:00.393 --> 00:37:04.402
the Crown during the Revolution,
like signing addresses,

00:37:04.402 --> 00:37:08.070
bearing arms against the
continental troops,

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:10.480
doing business with the British
army,

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.224
seeking military protection
from the British army or going

00:37:14.224 --> 00:37:15.079
into exile.
 

00:37:15.079 --> 00:37:18.186
So just people who were doing
those activities:

00:37:18.186 --> 00:37:21.090
fifteen to twenty percent of
white males.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:25.378
When you add to that percentage
those who just wanted to avoid

00:37:25.378 --> 00:37:29.528
involving themselves in the
struggle you end up with roughly

00:37:29.528 --> 00:37:34.030
half of the white male colonists
not falling into the category of

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:36.139
"Patriot"
or,

00:37:36.139 --> 00:37:38.190
if you use a term that the
Loyalists would have used,

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.460
"rebel."
 

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.579
So all in all,
only about half of the white

00:37:42.579 --> 00:37:46.889
male population actively
supported colonial resistance,

00:37:46.889 --> 00:37:50.318
and at different times of the
war, depending on the immediate

00:37:50.318 --> 00:37:52.934
circumstances,
obviously people changed their

00:37:52.934 --> 00:37:53.320
views.
 

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.505
Now there were any number of
reasons to stay loyal to the

00:37:58.505 --> 00:38:01.465
Crown,
and I'm guessing--certainly if

00:38:01.465 --> 00:38:05.579
I hadn't studied this time
period I would assume that there

00:38:05.579 --> 00:38:09.974
is this stereotypical image of
the Tory who one would assume is

00:38:09.974 --> 00:38:12.739
this sort of aristocratic
person,

00:38:12.739 --> 00:38:16.193
this really rich person in a
very fancy wig with very fancy

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:18.199
clothes,
taking snuff and doing a

00:38:18.199 --> 00:38:21.518
variety of other aristocratic
eighteenth-century gentry kind

00:38:21.518 --> 00:38:24.219
of things and sort of sneering
at the rebels.

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:26.898
I think there's sort of some
stereotype we have in our brain

00:38:26.898 --> 00:38:29.733
about who Tories are,
but as a matter of fact they

00:38:29.733 --> 00:38:33.719
were--some Tories fit into that
category but certainly not all.

00:38:33.719 --> 00:38:37.739
Wealth and poverty,
high status and low,

00:38:37.739 --> 00:38:42.106
every kind of ethnicity could
be found on both sides of the

00:38:42.106 --> 00:38:44.731
crisis,
and from colony to colony

00:38:44.731 --> 00:38:49.152
different kinds of people chose
different sides depending on

00:38:49.152 --> 00:38:51.099
regional circumstances.
 

00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:55.018
So for example:
In New York a lot of the landed

00:38:55.018 --> 00:38:57.659
gentry tended to be Loyalist.
 

00:38:57.659 --> 00:39:00.677
In Virginia,
the landed gentry tended to not

00:39:00.677 --> 00:39:01.659
be Loyalist.
 

00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:05.369
In Massachusetts,
small farmers tended to be

00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:06.320
Patriots.
 

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.684
In New York and North Carolina
the--or at least the up-country

00:39:10.684 --> 00:39:15.119
of North Carolina--small farmers
did not necessarily tend to be

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.050
Patriots.
 

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.197
So it obviously varied region
by region, depending on local

00:39:18.197 --> 00:39:18.789
circumstances.
 

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:23.260
In general terms--In very
general terms,

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:27.753
you could say that Loyalism was
stronger in the middle states

00:39:27.753 --> 00:39:32.396
than in New England and stronger
in the lower South than in the

00:39:32.396 --> 00:39:35.447
upper South,
and very strong particularly in

00:39:35.447 --> 00:39:37.552
New York,
which the British ended up

00:39:37.552 --> 00:39:39.650
holding throughout most of the
war,

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:45.059
and weakest in Massachusetts,
Virginia and Connecticut.

00:39:45.059 --> 00:39:47.059
Connecticut stood up.
 

00:39:47.059 --> 00:39:50.619
But there's a reason for that
because those are among the

00:39:50.619 --> 00:39:54.498
oldest colonies with a very long
tradition of self-government,

00:39:54.498 --> 00:39:56.469
aggressive self-government.
 

00:39:56.469 --> 00:39:59.730
Scholars who have studied
Loyalists have noted that there

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:03.164
seemed to be several types of
people who ended up being more

00:40:03.164 --> 00:40:04.969
likely to become Loyalists.
 

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:09.139
One likely Loyalist--and this
won't be surprising--

00:40:09.139 --> 00:40:12.195
would have been people who were
connected with the British

00:40:12.195 --> 00:40:15.090
government by some kind of an
official appointment,

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:18.342
or were related to somebody who
had an official royal

00:40:18.342 --> 00:40:19.219
appointment.
 

00:40:19.219 --> 00:40:23.135
For these people remaining
loyal was not necessarily due to

00:40:23.135 --> 00:40:25.675
self-interested reasons,
although certainly

00:40:25.675 --> 00:40:27.309
self-interest could have played
a part,

00:40:27.309 --> 00:40:30.713
but as important loyal
officeholders or people related

00:40:30.713 --> 00:40:34.759
to them had closer contact with
the British government than most

00:40:34.759 --> 00:40:37.554
others,
and thus they were better able

00:40:37.554 --> 00:40:40.389
to see the logic of politics in
England,

00:40:40.389 --> 00:40:44.929
so they had more reason to be
skeptical of claims about a

00:40:44.929 --> 00:40:49.550
conspiracy afoot in England to
destroy colonial rights.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:51.420
For example,
Thomas Hutchison up in

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.501
Massachusetts was honestly
baffled by the accusation that

00:40:54.501 --> 00:40:57.309
there was a plot against
colonial liberties and that

00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:59.070
somehow he was part of it.
 

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.041
He knew that he personally
wasn't conspiring against the

00:41:02.041 --> 00:41:03.530
colonies,
so he wasn't quite sure what

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.077
people were talking about,
and because of that he had good

00:41:06.077 --> 00:41:09.000
reason to doubt the enterprise
of what was going on.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.110
So that's one potential
Loyalist.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:16.190
A second kind of person who
tended to become a Loyalist

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:18.550
was--
again logically enough--people

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.420
who were in a religious or
cultural minority,

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:24.539
and who thus already felt a
little defensive and not

00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:27.719
necessarily trusting in the whim
of the majority--

00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:30.780
or the whim of the angry,
resistant majority.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:34.637
And I'm going to go into this
in more detail in a future

00:41:34.637 --> 00:41:37.202
lecture,
but for logical reasons a good

00:41:37.202 --> 00:41:40.726
many African-American slaves
ended up becoming Loyalists for

00:41:40.726 --> 00:41:44.072
good reason having to do with
the chance of earning their

00:41:44.072 --> 00:41:44.849
freedom.
 

00:41:44.849 --> 00:41:48.110
So that's a second kind.
 

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.376
A third kind of Loyalist
consisted of people who lived

00:41:51.376 --> 00:41:54.704
out in the hinterlands in the
backcountry away from the

00:41:54.704 --> 00:41:56.000
eastern seaboard.
 

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.768
And this is for a couple of
reasons,

00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:01.697
but one of the main ones is,
if you think about it the main

00:42:01.697 --> 00:42:04.626
vehicle or one of the main
vehicles for radical ideas would

00:42:04.626 --> 00:42:05.889
have been newspapers.
 

00:42:05.889 --> 00:42:10.699
And newspapers largely
circulated in large port cities.

00:42:10.699 --> 00:42:12.711
And I've quoted already a
number of times from the

00:42:12.711 --> 00:42:14.682
Boston Gazette,
which would have been hard

00:42:14.682 --> 00:42:16.449
to get out in the hinterland
somewhere.

00:42:16.449 --> 00:42:18.119
Tories called the Boston
Gazette--

00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:20.050
That's where Samuel Adams
wrote a lot of his things--

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.547
Tories called the Boston
Gazette the "Weekly

00:42:22.547 --> 00:42:23.409
Dung Barge."
 

00:42:23.409 --> 00:42:25.702
[laughs]
I think everybody just wins

00:42:25.702 --> 00:42:27.670
here in the propaganda game.
 

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.760
It's equally impressive on all
sides in the propaganda game.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.954
People out in the frontier in
Virginia or the Carolinas who

00:42:33.954 --> 00:42:37.039
didn't have a lot of access to
newspapers might have been

00:42:37.039 --> 00:42:40.510
harder to convince of a great
plot against their liberties.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.833
As one historian wrote,
"Not having been exposed

00:42:42.833 --> 00:42:45.070
to the 'disease,' how could they
catch it?"

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.445
None of these people had a
particular reason to be swept up

00:42:48.445 --> 00:42:51.762
in the resistance movement,
and they had reasons to resist

00:42:51.762 --> 00:42:52.170
it.
 

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:56.829
By 1774, all of these
people--royal officeholders,

00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:59.632
cultural or religious
minorities, people living out on

00:42:59.632 --> 00:43:02.072
the frontier--
were conscious minorities,

00:43:02.072 --> 00:43:04.768
people who felt either weak or
threatened,

00:43:04.768 --> 00:43:08.315
particularly considering raging
events in cities along the

00:43:08.315 --> 00:43:09.000
seaboard.
 

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.083
So in a way,
you could say that many

00:43:11.083 --> 00:43:14.534
Loyalists were simply more
afraid of the rebelling colonies

00:43:14.534 --> 00:43:16.440
than they were of the Crown.
 

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.900
Almost all of them had
interests that they felt needed

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:22.840
protection from a raging
American majority.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.672
Now these Loyalists did not
necessarily have vast

00:43:25.672 --> 00:43:29.096
ideological differences from
people who came to be known as

00:43:29.096 --> 00:43:32.032
the American Patriots,
but they might have,

00:43:32.032 --> 00:43:35.927
and in fact some Loyalists
actually believed precisely what

00:43:35.927 --> 00:43:38.210
the rebels believed in reverse.
 

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.170
So in the same way that the
colonists thought there was this

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:44.030
plot forming in Parliament to
curb colonial liberties,

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:47.813
some Loyalists saw a plot
forming among radical colonists

00:43:47.813 --> 00:43:51.123
who were falsely claiming to
represent the people.

00:43:51.123 --> 00:43:51.800
Right?
 

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.150
That makes perfect sense.
 

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.704
Many of these Loyalists did not
part with the colonial majority

00:43:56.704 --> 00:43:58.940
until well into the imperial
crisis,

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.418
and for many,
as we'll see,

00:44:00.418 --> 00:44:03.150
it's not until independence
becomes probable,

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:05.224
and when real,
actual separation from the

00:44:05.224 --> 00:44:08.737
mother country is at hand,
that they felt compelled to

00:44:08.737 --> 00:44:13.199
declare their loyalty to the
Crown and actually break away.

00:44:13.199 --> 00:44:16.014
This was actually part of the
agony of the Revolution,

00:44:16.014 --> 00:44:19.307
the fact that many people just
weren't sure of what they should

00:44:19.307 --> 00:44:19.679
do.
 

00:44:19.679 --> 00:44:21.079
They weren't sure how they felt
about the crisis.

00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:22.989
They weren't sure what side to
take.

00:44:22.989 --> 00:44:25.239
They weren't sure that they
wanted to take a side.

00:44:25.239 --> 00:44:27.518
They weren't sure what would
happen if they did.

00:44:27.518 --> 00:44:31.739
And on all sides people still
cared about the colonies.

00:44:31.739 --> 00:44:35.320
They just had different visions
about the right course of

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.487
action--
and people had to just make

00:44:37.487 --> 00:44:40.994
these sorts of decisions about
their loyalties on an individual

00:44:40.994 --> 00:44:43.434
level,
and obviously there were many

00:44:43.434 --> 00:44:46.989
different levels of loyalty to
the British government.

00:44:46.989 --> 00:44:49.070
So I suppose what I'm saying
here--I'll wrap it up here.

00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:53.525
In a sense, it's really easy to
analyze and pass judgment on the

00:44:53.525 --> 00:44:57.438
decision to become a Loyalist,
but I think it's just as easy

00:44:57.438 --> 00:45:00.539
to analyze and pass judgment on
the decision to resist the

00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:01.030
Crown.
 

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:04.376
I think one way or another,
people were evaluating what was

00:45:04.376 --> 00:45:05.070
happening.
 

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:08.385
People were thinking about what
they thought the proper course

00:45:08.385 --> 00:45:11.481
of action should be and then
making individual choices for

00:45:11.481 --> 00:45:13.980
any number of reasons,
some of them ideological,

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.182
some of them personal,
having to do with your family,

00:45:16.182 --> 00:45:17.639
having to do with your
livelihood,

00:45:17.639 --> 00:45:19.880
having to do with your safety
and security.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:25.431
So one way or another,
making this decision was kind

00:45:25.431 --> 00:45:27.610
of an extreme act.
 

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:31.659
And the period that we're now
at in this course--1774,1775--is

00:45:31.659 --> 00:45:35.510
precisely when those sorts of
decisions have to be made.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:38.197
We'll be talking about
Common Sense on Thursday,

00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:40.936
which does a lot towards
pushing some people into making

00:45:40.936 --> 00:45:42.429
a pretty radical decision.
 

00:45:42.429 --> 00:45:44.920
I will see you on Thursday.
 

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.797
Those of you did not turn in
your papers, turn them in to

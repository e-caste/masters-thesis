00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:01.920
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Okay.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.660
I'd like to begin.
Welcome back.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.020
It is good to see you all.
It's a bit startling.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.950
I don't know where those two
weeks went.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.919
So, tell me:
I asked you to read Blood

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.758
Meridian over break;
was this a happy Spring Break

00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:20.563
task for you?
Was it good "beach reading," as

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:22.460
I promised?
No?

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.812
No.
I'd like, before I begin my

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:28.717
lecture today,
just to hear a little bit from

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:31.342
you,
just so that I know what you're

00:00:31.342 --> 00:00:34.760
thinking about as I talk to you
about this book.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.184
Who liked this novel?
Okay, a good,

00:00:39.184 --> 00:00:42.597
maybe, half of you.
Someone tell me why they liked

00:00:42.597 --> 00:00:44.857
it;
someone, someone,

00:00:44.857 --> 00:00:48.990
someone tell me why they liked
it.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.060
Okay.
Now you're getting all quiet.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.611
Someone can tell me one
sentence why you liked this

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:56.010
novel.
Yes.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860
Thank you.Student:
I like how creepy the judge

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.546
is.Professor Amy
Hungerford: You like how

00:00:59.546 --> 00:01:02.439
creepy the judge is.
It is impressive how creepy he

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.219
is, yes.
Okay. Why else?

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:07.275
Yes.Student:
I actually like how kind of

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.819
quickly and bluntly some of the
atrocities happen in it.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:14.468
So, you'll be reading a passage
where there are pretty mundane

00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:17.220
things, and then all of a
sudden, slaughter.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.902
Professor Amy
Hungerford: And you liked

00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:21.750
that?
That was good. Yeah.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.463
It certainly is a kind of
virtuosic representation of

00:01:27.463 --> 00:01:30.540
violence, yes,
absolutely.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.704
What did it remind you of?
Well, yes, yes.Student:

00:01:32.704 --> 00:01:34.672
I liked how ambiguous the
ending was.Professor Amy

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:37.285
Hungerford: Yeah.
The ending is very strange,

00:01:37.285 --> 00:01:39.530
and we'll talk about that.
What else?

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.880
Yes.Student:
I liked that it read like a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.501
nightmare.Professor Amy
Hungerford: It read like a

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.441
nightmare.
What does that

00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:45.045
mean?Student:
I just remember,

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:46.650
reading it, it felt like a
nightmare.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.564
It was very,
sort of, jumbled,

00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:48.824
and just very sensory,
and it felt like a

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:50.590
nightmare.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yeah.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.563
It is very sensory.
This prose concentrates so much

00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:59.093
on the material of the world,
absolutely, and it does have

00:01:59.093 --> 00:02:04.019
that feeling of drawing you into
its world very completely.

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:07.197
I think, also,
that sense of nightmarishness

00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:11.631
is heightened by the fact that
the plot is not very strong in

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.799
this novel.
That's not what's driving this

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:15.910
novel.
You're laughing.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.972
Why do you laugh?
Why do you laugh about that,

00:02:20.972 --> 00:02:24.099
about the plot?
Yes.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.021
You're still smiling from the
laughter, so I'm going to ask

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:27.684
you.
Student:

00:02:27.684 --> 00:02:31.199
Just because yes,
that is true.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:37.908
That's part of the reason that
I found it difficult to continue

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:43.534
reading, just maybe be
interested by the- I guess the

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:46.131
dry,
sort of emotionless way of

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:49.285
presenting violence.
It was sort of interesting,

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:52.599
but the fact that there didn't
seem to be a point,

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.549
or a place that they're going,
it made it really hard to not

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.470
just be, like.
"oh, this is going to be

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.419
disgusting."Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yeah.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.800
It can produce this aversion in
readers.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.840
How many were averse to this
novel?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.409
Okay, a few of you, at least.
Yeah.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.770
I think, - when I first tried
to read this novel,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.220
I failed twice.
I'm a sensitive soul.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.506
So, I failed twice to read this
novel because of its violence,

00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:24.753
and then I persevered.
But it can get,

00:03:24.753 --> 00:03:27.488
actually kind of boring,
sometimes, I think,

00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:31.448
because of the plotlessness.
So, unless you're really

00:03:31.448 --> 00:03:36.253
interested in how the story is
being told in that language,

00:03:36.253 --> 00:03:40.312
it can be repetitive and can
numb you as a reader,

00:03:40.312 --> 00:03:43.833
I think.
These are all aspects of the

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:49.155
novel that I will try to account
for over the course of my two

00:03:49.155 --> 00:03:54.393
lectures today and on Wednesday.
There are two other things I'm

00:03:54.393 --> 00:03:56.940
going to do in these two
lectures.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.424
One is, today,
to think hard about what it

00:04:01.424 --> 00:04:05.580
means to track allusions in a
novel.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.360
So, that's going to be one
thing that I do today.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.955
Allusions appear in most of
the things that we read,

00:04:11.955 --> 00:04:16.497
dare I say all of them,
but one never quite knows what

00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:21.149
to do with them,
once you have identified them.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:25.622
Now, the sense of literature as
an art with a history depends on

00:04:25.622 --> 00:04:29.528
our being able to do something
with allusions or to have

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:33.589
something to say about them.
What does it mean that one

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.649
novel speaks to a novel or a
poem or another kind of writing

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:40.787
from the past?
How are we to make sense of

00:04:40.787 --> 00:04:43.629
that in the evolution of the art
form?

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:49.494
This is a foundation of what
English literary study looks

00:04:49.494 --> 00:04:53.370
like pretty much at any
university.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.297
At any university,
if you're an English major,

00:04:56.297 --> 00:04:59.680
you're asked to study a
historical range of texts.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.978
You're asked to master,
in some portion,

00:05:02.978 --> 00:05:06.615
or to some extent,
the literary tradition in

00:05:06.615 --> 00:05:09.029
English.
What does it mean that we're

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.677
asked to do that?
Cormac McCarthy's novel

00:05:12.677 --> 00:05:17.459
gives us the opportunity to take
a case study.

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:20.005
What does it mean,
in this day,

00:05:20.005 --> 00:05:23.568
in this time,
for this writer to be writing

00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:27.397
in a tradition?
So, allusion is one thing I'll

00:05:27.397 --> 00:05:31.610
focus on that's of general
interest in literary studies.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.784
The second thing,
in the second lecture,

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:38.529
that I will focus on is what to
do with detail,

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:43.820
what to do with that odd detail
that you notice in the novel.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.530
It could be anything.
Is there a way of making an

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.254
argument that will radiate out
from that detail into some more

00:05:53.254 --> 00:05:56.120
holistic understanding of a
novel?

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.397
My second lecture will be a
demonstration of that and an

00:05:59.397 --> 00:06:02.019
argument for that as a literary
technique,

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:06.289
and I hope that this will be
useful to you in writing the

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.329
next paper, which will be coming
up fairly shortly.

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:13.967
So, I want to begin,
then, with this quotation from

00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:18.030
Cormac McCarthy.
This was his first interview,

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.759
1992.
Many of you probably know he's

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.752
gotten a lot more press since
Oprah's Book Club chose his

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.819
latest novel,
The Road.

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.680
He's sort of been out and
about.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.385
He gave her an interview.
He's given an interview since

00:06:33.385 --> 00:06:36.916
then for a magazine.
Before that he was a very

00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:40.369
reclusive writer,
and he had been writing since

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:44.948
the late '60s and by 1992--up
until that point--he had refused

00:06:44.948 --> 00:06:48.346
all interviews.
He usually refused readings,

00:06:48.346 --> 00:06:52.260
even when he had zero money.
He lived out of hotel rooms,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.302
even when he was married and
had a son, when he was a young

00:06:56.302 --> 00:06:58.779
man.
He's on his third marriage now.

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:03.287
He would turn down invitations
to read even when they were down

00:07:03.287 --> 00:07:06.807
to their last dollar.
His ex-wife tells some amusing

00:07:06.807 --> 00:07:10.013
stories about this.
He'd get an invitation to read,

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.687
he'd turn it down,
and they'd eat beans for

00:07:12.687 --> 00:07:16.762
another night.
So, that's her take on what

00:07:16.762 --> 00:07:21.238
that life was like.
He says in this interview:

00:07:21.238 --> 00:07:25.319
"The ugly fact is books are
made out of books.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:28.976
The novel depends for its life
on the novels that have been

00:07:28.976 --> 00:07:32.205
written."
So, this is my invitation to

00:07:32.205 --> 00:07:36.370
take seriously allusion in
Blood Meridian.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:40.284
Did anybody on their own
recognize some of the sources of

00:07:40.284 --> 00:07:44.890
Blood Meridian?
Did you notice any allusions?

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:46.895
Yes.
Student:

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:48.890
Oral history,
storytelling.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.912
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yes,

00:07:56.912 --> 00:07:57.392
absolutely.
Yeah.

00:07:57.392 --> 00:08:00.019
The oral tradition is very
powerful in McCarthy's writing.

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:03.160
The sound of the prose is very
important to him.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:03.870
Yeah.
What else?

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.047
Yes.Student:
Along those same lines,

00:08:06.047 --> 00:08:09.220
when he frequently talks about
the sun coming up or going down,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.525
there is a lot of that in
The Odyssey,

00:08:11.525 --> 00:08:13.202
when the sun's fingers are
coming

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:16.189
out…Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yeah.

00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:19.894
A lot of that cosmic imagery,
I think he does take from the

00:08:19.894 --> 00:08:23.100
great epics of our language.
Yes.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.939
What else?
What else did you notice?

00:08:25.939 --> 00:08:28.389
Yes.Student:
I noticed a lot of

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:31.376
references to the Bible:
the burning bush and other

00:08:31.376 --> 00:08:34.244
things.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yeah,

00:08:34.244 --> 00:08:36.366
absolutely.
The Bible is peppered

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:38.791
throughout this,
and I'm going to have a lot to

00:08:38.791 --> 00:08:40.899
say about that--some to say
about it,

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:43.841
today, but I have a whole
argument about that that I'll

00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:45.620
get to on Wednesday.
Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.480
What else?
Anything else you noticed?

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.019
Well, I'm going to start,
actually, a little bit closer

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:57.129
to home, in the American
tradition.

00:08:57.129 --> 00:08:58.730
I'm going to start with
Moby-Dick.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.848
This is my lineup of texts
that I am going to use today to

00:09:01.848 --> 00:09:04.047
talk about Blood
Meridian. So,

00:09:04.047 --> 00:09:05.990
I want to start with Moby
Dick.

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:11.382
This is probably the single
most important book for

00:09:11.382 --> 00:09:17.075
McCarthy, beside the Bible,
as a source for both language,

00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:20.870
character, ideas,
moral questions.

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.230
All kinds of things come from
Moby-Dick.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.536
And, if you want to begin
in the easiest way,

00:09:26.536 --> 00:09:29.360
the first thing is to think
about Ahab.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.105
Ahab is known for his
monomaniacal evil,

00:09:34.105 --> 00:09:39.460
his evil quest to take on the
white whale.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.340
As a character who is
loquacious, charismatic,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.461
threatening,
violent, he is very much a

00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:53.171
model for Judge Holden.
So, in that simple,

00:09:53.171 --> 00:09:57.860
general way McCarthy owes a
debt to Moby-Dick.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:03.265
There are many specific
ways that this novel owes a debt

00:10:03.265 --> 00:10:06.673
to Moby-Dick.
One, that I'll joint point

00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:09.780
out, is from the prophet chapter
in Moby-Dick.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.417
That's chapter 19.
If you've read the novel,

00:10:13.417 --> 00:10:18.815
you can recall that before
Ishmael and Queequeg get on the

00:10:18.815 --> 00:10:23.929
Pequod they are accosted by a
beggar in the street.

00:10:23.929 --> 00:10:28.447
And his name is Elijah,
and he warns them in very

00:10:28.447 --> 00:10:34.000
cryptic language about what
they've actually signed away,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.070
when they signed the papers to
board the Pequod.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.097
And he suggests that what
they've signed away is their

00:10:42.097 --> 00:10:46.049
souls, not just the couple of
years of their life.

00:10:46.049 --> 00:10:51.746
The version that we get in
Blood Meridian can be

00:10:51.746 --> 00:10:54.490
found on page 40 and 41.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.110
It actually starts on 39.

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:13.003
The kid has joined up with
Captain White's gang of

00:11:13.003 --> 00:11:19.588
filibusters, and they are in a
bar and there they find--this is

00:11:19.588 --> 00:11:23.668
on 39--an old,
disordered Mennonite in this

00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:26.122
place.
And he turns to study them,

00:11:26.122 --> 00:11:29.380
"a thin man in a leather
waistcoat, a black and

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.417
straight-brimmed hat set square
on his head, a thin rim of

00:11:33.417 --> 00:11:36.444
whiskers."
And, if you look at the

00:11:36.444 --> 00:11:40.972
Moby-Dick version,
I just want to point out how

00:11:40.972 --> 00:11:44.389
closely he's following the cues
here.

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:47.859
"Queequeg and I had just
left the Pequod and were

00:11:47.859 --> 00:11:52.231
sauntering away from the water,
for the moment each occupied

00:11:52.231 --> 00:11:56.493
with his own thoughts,
when the above words [shipmates

00:11:56.493 --> 00:12:01.076
have ye shipped in that ship]
were put to us by a stranger

00:12:01.076 --> 00:12:02.915
who,
pausing before us,

00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:06.509
leveled his massive forefinger
at the vessel in question.

00:12:06.509 --> 00:12:10.073
He was but shabbily appareled
in faded jacket and patched

00:12:10.073 --> 00:12:13.255
trousers, a rag of black
handkerchief investing his

00:12:13.255 --> 00:12:17.005
neck.
Just the way that description,

00:12:17.005 --> 00:12:22.409
the very brief description of
his outfit, what he's wearing

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:26.889
around his neck,
his hat: they match up,

00:12:26.889 --> 00:12:32.705
in these two little paragraphs.
The Mennonite,

00:12:32.705 --> 00:12:39.862
however, is much more dire,
much less playful than

00:12:39.862 --> 00:12:47.999
Melville's Elijah.
He says to the assembled men:

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:55.690
"They'll jail you to a man"
This is on 40:

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.398
"Who will?"
"The United States Army,

00:12:57.398 --> 00:12:59.100
General Worth."
"The hell they will."

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.700
"Pray that they will."
He looks at his comrades.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:07.629
He leans toward the Mennonite.
"What does that mean, old man?"

00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:12.093
"Do ye cross that river with
yon filibuster armed you'll not

00:13:12.093 --> 00:13:14.760
cross it back."
"Don't aim to cross it back.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.759
We goin' to Sonora.
What's it to you, old man?"

00:13:18.759 --> 00:13:21.844
The Mennonite watches the
enshadowed dark before them as

00:13:21.844 --> 00:13:24.760
it is reflected to him in the
mirror over the bar.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.800
He turns to them.
His eyes are wet.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.590
He speaks slowly.
"The wrath of God lies sleeping.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:35.185
It was hid a million years
before men were and only men

00:13:35.185 --> 00:13:38.630
have the power to wake it.
Hell ain't half full.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:41.839
Hear me.
Ye carry war of a madman's

00:13:41.839 --> 00:13:46.570
making into a foreign land,
ye'll wake more than the dogs."

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.915
But they berated the old man
and swore at him until he moved

00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:54.220
off down the bar muttering.
And how else could it be?

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.737
How these things end,
in confusion and curses and

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:01.164
blood.
They drank on and the wind blew

00:14:01.164 --> 00:14:04.297
in the streets and the stars
that had been overhead lay low

00:14:04.297 --> 00:14:07.593
in the west and these young men
fell afoul of others and words

00:14:07.593 --> 00:14:10.240
were said that could not be put
right again,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.640
and in the dawn the kid and the
second corporal knelt over the

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.930
boy from Missouri who had been
named Earl and they spoke his

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:20.588
name but he never spoke back.
He lay on his side in the dust

00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:22.760
of the courtyard.
The men were gone.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.934
The whores were gone.
An old man swept the clay floor

00:14:25.934 --> 00:14:28.878
within the cantina.
The boy lay with his skull

00:14:28.878 --> 00:14:32.059
broken in a pool of blood,
none knew by whom.

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:35.560
A third one came to be with
them in the courtyard.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.851
It was the Mennonite.
A warm wind was blowing and the

00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:42.910
east held a gray light.
The fowls roosting along the

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:45.529
grapevines had begun to stir and
call.

00:14:45.529 --> 00:14:50.101
"There is no such joy in the
tavern as upon the road

00:14:50.101 --> 00:14:54.753
thereto," said the Mennonite.
He had been holding his hat in

00:14:54.753 --> 00:14:58.563
his hands and now he set it upon
his head again and turned and

00:14:58.563 --> 00:15:03.502
went out the gate.
He offers them these portentous

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:10.008
sayings, like this last little
epigram about the tavern and the

00:15:10.008 --> 00:15:13.890
road thereto,
and he uses this archaic

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.999
language.
Moby-Dick's

00:15:16.999 --> 00:15:20.904
prophet, who occupies the
same structural spot,

00:15:20.904 --> 00:15:25.980
accosting the main characters
as they go out on their journey,

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.461
is much more playful.
He is berated by Ishmael for

00:15:30.461 --> 00:15:35.880
pretending to have a big secret,
for speaking as if he had a

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.370
secret to tell,
but not telling it.

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:46.516
So, McCarthy takes the model
and transforms it slightly,

00:15:46.516 --> 00:15:53.793
brings it into a realm where
sincerity and depth and fear

00:15:53.793 --> 00:16:01.590
replace the inklings of fear
around a core of good will,

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:07.157
irony, playfulness.
The reason there is that

00:16:07.157 --> 00:16:11.111
difference, I think,
is that McCarthy has decided

00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:16.100
not to give us an Ishmael.
Ishmael is an incredibly

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.600
charming narrator.
He is thoughtful;

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.590
he's funny;
he is a little self-mocking;

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:32.503
he can wax both grand and silly;
he can recognize his own

00:16:32.503 --> 00:16:35.791
silliness.
There's a vast interior of

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:40.340
Ishmael's mind that we see in
this narrative.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.254
We never see the like of this
from the kid,

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:48.388
never.
This is one way in which

00:16:48.388 --> 00:16:53.244
McCarthy has revised Melville,
so this is one of those

00:16:53.244 --> 00:16:58.649
observations I'm going to,
sort of, put up on the shelf.

00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:03.429
What does it mean that this is
the way he has revised Melville?

00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:07.370
This is one of the questions
that my two lectures,

00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:12.380
together, will answer.
What does that revision mean?

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:17.279
Another specific scene in
which McCarthy is revising

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:22.090
Melville comes when Toadvine
almost kills the judge.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:26.420
Do you remember the scene?
The judge has been dandling the

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:31.052
little Indian boy on his knee.
The men around the campfire are

00:17:31.052 --> 00:17:33.619
delighted.
They laugh.

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:36.761
In the morning the judge has
killed the boy,

00:17:36.761 --> 00:17:40.049
and scalped it,
and is wiping his hands on his

00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:43.318
pants.
And Toadvine puts his revolver

00:17:43.318 --> 00:17:46.618
to the judge's head,
and the judge says,

00:17:46.618 --> 00:17:49.750
"Shoot that thing or put it
away."

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:54.963
And Toadvine puts it away.
This is the direct echo of a

00:17:54.963 --> 00:17:59.630
moment when Starbuck stands
outside Ahab's cabin.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:05.193
Ahab's maniacal quest for the
whale has been made apparent to

00:18:05.193 --> 00:18:09.368
the whole ship.
Starbuck, that wise and

00:18:09.368 --> 00:18:14.452
deliberative man,
understands that the fate of

00:18:14.452 --> 00:18:20.667
the whole ship has now been
recruited to Ahab's maniacal

00:18:20.667 --> 00:18:24.508
cause.
He knows that if he takes the

00:18:24.508 --> 00:18:29.884
musket and shoots Ahab in his
bed he will save the whole ship

00:18:29.884 --> 00:18:34.500
of men.
He does not do it.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:39.641
So, both Toadvine and Starbuck
are presented with a moral

00:18:39.641 --> 00:18:43.957
problem: Do you murder the
leader of an immoral,

00:18:43.957 --> 00:18:50.539
ill-fated, violent quest?
Both men decide not to.

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:54.175
This is a scene I'll come
back to next time,

00:18:54.175 --> 00:18:57.578
on Wednesday,
and I'll have more to say about

00:18:57.578 --> 00:18:59.089
it.
But, for now,

00:18:59.089 --> 00:19:02.745
one thing that we can say about
it is, once again,

00:19:02.745 --> 00:19:07.146
the lack of interiority for
these characters makes a crucial

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:10.514
difference.
It's a crucial point of

00:19:10.514 --> 00:19:13.234
revision.
Starbuck, we know,

00:19:13.234 --> 00:19:16.769
is deliberative.
We know he is a wise man.

00:19:16.769 --> 00:19:21.177
He gives counsel to Ahab over
the whole course of the novel:

00:19:21.177 --> 00:19:24.464
to abandon his quest,
to go home to his wife,

00:19:24.464 --> 00:19:28.515
at the very end of the novel.
In a crucial moment,

00:19:28.515 --> 00:19:31.845
Starbuck gives an impassioned
plea to Ahab,

00:19:31.845 --> 00:19:35.175
reminds him of his wife and
child and says,

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:41.980
"Leave off chasing that whale.
Let us live and go home."

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.890
We have no such history for
Toadvine.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.761
What do we know about Toadvine?
Well, he wears a scapular of

00:19:48.761 --> 00:19:53.262
ears that he's cut off.
He has tattoos from his

00:19:53.262 --> 00:19:59.456
criminal past on his face.
He wears the evidence of a

00:19:59.456 --> 00:20:04.214
criminal life,
not the furrowed brow of

00:20:04.214 --> 00:20:09.873
Starbuck's thought.
He is a very different kind of

00:20:09.873 --> 00:20:15.969
character, and that leads us to
wonder how we need to understand

00:20:15.969 --> 00:20:22.055
his failure to shoot the judge.
Is it that moral complexity

00:20:22.055 --> 00:20:27.957
yields lack of decisiveness,
as we might say for Starbuck,

00:20:27.957 --> 00:20:34.170
that moral complexity is
presented as a kind of weakness?

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:40.779
Or, is that far too much to say
about Toadvine?

00:20:40.779 --> 00:20:43.150
Is Toadvine a morally complex
character?

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:47.670
Do we have any basis upon which
to say such a thing?

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:51.289
So, this is another kind of
question we want to ask.

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:55.070
Now I'm going to move to my
second in line,

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.029
here, and that's Paradise
Lost.

00:20:58.029 --> 00:21:03.307
McCarthy rings the changes
on the great voices of American

00:21:03.307 --> 00:21:07.980
literature, but also of world
literature in English.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.238
You were talking about The
Iliad and the epic

00:21:10.238 --> 00:21:12.382
tradition.
In this case,

00:21:12.382 --> 00:21:17.589
he is entering the great realm
of poetry.

00:21:17.589 --> 00:21:22.763
Now he gives a specific
revision of Paradise Lost

00:21:22.763 --> 00:21:28.140
in Blood Meridian,
if you recall.

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:30.007
How many of you have taken a
Milton class,

00:21:30.007 --> 00:21:31.850
or have read Milton in class?
Okay.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:36.412
Okay, a good number of you,
so probably a bunch of you

00:21:36.412 --> 00:21:41.425
realize this.
When the judge makes gunpowder,

00:21:41.425 --> 00:21:46.369
do you remember this scene?
The men are out of gunpowder.

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:48.029
They find the judge in the
desert.

00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:51.654
They're being hounded by the
Indians they've been chasing all

00:21:51.654 --> 00:21:54.549
this time.
They're at their mercy.

00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:56.710
They know they're going to be
massacred.

00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:59.102
They find the judge sitting on
a rock in the middle of the

00:21:59.102 --> 00:22:02.040
desert.
Who knows how he got there?

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:06.473
Glanton takes him up.
He rides with them,

00:22:06.473 --> 00:22:10.660
and he takes them to a volcanic
cone, a dead cone,

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:15.190
and there he instructs them how
to make gunpowder.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.821
He takes brimstone from the rim
of the cone, he mixes it with

00:22:19.821 --> 00:22:23.989
charcoal and other things,
and then he has them piss on

00:22:23.989 --> 00:22:26.234
it.
And from this he makes

00:22:26.234 --> 00:22:30.807
gunpowder, and they use that
gunpowder to defeat the Indians

00:22:30.807 --> 00:22:34.246
who come after them.
Well, this is taken

00:22:34.246 --> 00:22:38.973
directly from Paradise Lost.
Satan instructs his fiends

00:22:38.973 --> 00:22:43.174
in how to make gunpowder,
and I'm going to read you a

00:22:43.174 --> 00:22:46.890
little bit from Book 6 of
Paradise Lost.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:50.821
So, the fiends are down in
Hell strategizing,

00:22:50.821 --> 00:22:55.900
somewhat in despair over their
chances against God's angels.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.569
The fallen angels are standing
around Satan,

00:22:58.569 --> 00:23:01.240
and they're taking turns making
speeches,

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.359
and they've just heard a speech
from a fallen angel who says,

00:23:06.359 --> 00:23:09.259
"We really need a better
weapon.

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:11.869
Otherwise we're never going to
win this war."

00:23:11.869 --> 00:23:16.500
And here is what Satan has to
say.

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.460
Whereto with look
composed Satan replied.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.150
Not uninvented that,
which thou arightBelievest

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.660
so main to our success,
I bring.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.562
Which of us who beholds the
bright surfaceOf this

00:23:30.562 --> 00:23:33.190
ethereous mould whereon we
stand,

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:37.096
This continent of spacious
Heaven, adornedWith plant,

00:23:37.096 --> 00:23:40.089
fruit, flower ambrosial,
gems, and gold;

00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:43.353
Whose eye so superficially
surveysThese things,

00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:47.269
as not to mind from whence they
growDeep under ground,

00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:51.198
materials dark and crude,Of
spiritous and fiery spume,

00:23:51.198 --> 00:23:53.680
till touchedWith Heaven's
ray,

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.961
and tempered,
they shoot forthSo

00:23:55.961 --> 00:23:58.700
beauteous, opening to the
ambient light?

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.658
These in their dark nativity
the deepShall yield us,

00:24:02.658 --> 00:24:06.426
pregnant with infernal flame;
Which, into hollow engines,

00:24:06.426 --> 00:24:09.499
long and round,Thick
rammed, at the other bore with

00:24:09.499 --> 00:24:11.890
touch of fireDilated and
infuriate,

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:15.920
[that's very much a McCarthy
word, infuriate]

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:19.565
shall send forthFrom far,
with thundering noise,

00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:22.010
among our foesSuch
implements of mischief,

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.210
as shall dashTo pieces,
and o'erwhelm whatever

00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:28.495
standsAdverse,
that they shall fear we have

00:24:28.495 --> 00:24:32.779
disarmedThe Thunderer of his
only dreaded bolt.

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:35.030
So, there Satan's saying,
"Look at the world.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:39.197
You look at all these plants.
The chemicals we need are in

00:24:39.197 --> 00:24:43.349
this earth."
So, this is what the judge

00:24:43.349 --> 00:24:48.049
says, for his part,
in like circumstance.

00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:51.376
This is on 129,130,
and this, remember,

00:24:51.376 --> 00:24:54.440
is told by Tobin,
the ex-priest:

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.360
In all this time,--[as
they were riding across the

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.669
plain without gunpowder]
In all this time the judge had

00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:18.034
spoke hardly a word.
So at dawn we were on the edge

00:25:18.034 --> 00:25:22.011
of a vast malpais and his honor
takes up a position on some lava

00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:25.799
rocks there and he commences to
give us an address.

00:25:25.799 --> 00:25:28.049
See, there is that same
structural position.

00:25:28.049 --> 00:25:33.517
The judge occupies the place
that Satan does in Paradise

00:25:33.517 --> 00:25:38.083
Lost and gives a speech:
It was like a sermon but

00:25:38.083 --> 00:25:41.480
it was no such sermon as any man
of us had ever heard before.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.020
Beyond the malpais was a
volcanic peak and in the sunrise

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.549
it was many colors and there was
dark,

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:50.837
little birds crossin down the
wind and the wind was flappin

00:25:50.837 --> 00:25:54.351
the judge's old benjamin about
him and he pointed to that stark

00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:57.526
and solitary mountain and
delivered himself of an oration

00:25:57.526 --> 00:26:00.118
to what end I know not,
then or now,

00:26:00.118 --> 00:26:04.544
and he concluded with the
tellin us that our mother earth

00:26:04.544 --> 00:26:09.365
as he said was round like an egg
and contained all good things

00:26:09.365 --> 00:26:12.035
within her.
Then he turned and led the

00:26:12.035 --> 00:26:15.387
horse he had been ridin across
that terrain of black and glassy

00:26:15.387 --> 00:26:17.976
slag,
treacherous to men and beast

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:21.904
alike, and us behind him like
the disciples of a new

00:26:21.904 --> 00:26:25.207
faith.
So, the oration urging them to

00:26:25.207 --> 00:26:29.215
see in the earth all the things
they need: exactly out of

00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:32.150
Paradise Lost. And
then,

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:37.199
a little further down the page,
you see that Tobin speculates

00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:41.828
about the volcanic terrain
they're crossing - "where for

00:26:41.828 --> 00:26:46.119
aught any man knows lies the
locality of Hell."

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:51.190
He even speculates that this is
where Hell's entrance might be.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:56.376
So, what does McCarthy do when
he invites us to see the judge

00:26:56.376 --> 00:27:01.738
as the parallel of Satan?
I think this is one of the most

00:27:01.738 --> 00:27:06.720
powerful allusions driving
readings of this novel.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.877
Lots of readers have taken
Judge Holden as heroic evil,

00:27:10.877 --> 00:27:14.420
on the model of Milton's
Satan.Remember,

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:19.523
the famous problem about
Paradise Lost is that,

00:27:19.523 --> 00:27:25.589
here was Milton writing it to
justify the ways of God to men,

00:27:25.589 --> 00:27:32.184
justifying how good God was,
and yet Satan is this

00:27:32.184 --> 00:27:39.609
incredibly compelling character.
Milton writes Satan to be

00:27:39.609 --> 00:27:43.826
irresistible,
and in particular he is,

00:27:43.826 --> 00:27:47.144
rhetorically,
incredibly gifted,

00:27:47.144 --> 00:27:51.959
and so he makes all of these
wonderful speeches that Milton

00:27:51.959 --> 00:27:55.529
writes for him that we get to
listen to.

00:27:55.529 --> 00:28:00.200
So, McCarthy sets up a similar
problem in Blood Meridian.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.970
Here is the judge.
He has this compelling language

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:09.910
that we want to listen to.
It's very sonorous.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:15.627
There is that debt to the oral
tradition, and yet he is this

00:28:15.627 --> 00:28:20.451
incredibly evil man.
So, there is a problem,

00:28:20.451 --> 00:28:24.862
here, of moral valence.
Can we condemn,

00:28:24.862 --> 00:28:29.029
or does the book condemn,
this figure?

00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:30.799
It's the problem in Paradise
Lost.

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.779
It's the problem,
also, in Blood Meridian.

00:28:33.779 --> 00:28:37.980
If you find the violence in
Blood Meridian simply

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.897
gratuitous, then you've answered
that, in a certain way,

00:28:41.897 --> 00:28:44.878
by saying, "No.
The character is not so

00:28:44.878 --> 00:28:49.057
compelling that I can put up
with the graphic representation

00:28:49.057 --> 00:28:52.809
of violence.
It doesn't make it worth it."

00:28:52.809 --> 00:28:57.073
But there is another school of
thought that says the aesthetics

00:28:57.073 --> 00:29:00.099
of the violence,
the aesthetics of the judge,

00:29:00.099 --> 00:29:04.420
do make it worth it.
So, that is a kind of debt.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:09.127
The other way this sheds
light on the novel is to say

00:29:09.127 --> 00:29:14.194
that the novel is concerned,
like Paradise Lost,

00:29:14.194 --> 00:29:18.670
with the great cosmic
structures of the world.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.114
Now, this is another element,
too, of its use of the Bible,

00:29:22.114 --> 00:29:24.430
and I'll talk about that in a
minute.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.944
But it gives,
for the novel,

00:29:26.944 --> 00:29:32.057
a certain kind of weight.
It makes us read it looking for

00:29:32.057 --> 00:29:37.000
those big, cosmic structures and
statements about those big,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.508
cosmic structures.
It lends it weight unleavened

00:29:41.508 --> 00:29:46.627
by the kinds of delightful
playfulness that we see from

00:29:46.627 --> 00:29:49.970
Ishmael.
Melville is full of the Bible,

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:54.419
and full of portentousness,
too, but always Ishmael's voice

00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:58.014
is there charming us.
What we have here,

00:29:58.014 --> 00:30:02.009
instead, is sheer
portentousness--some say

00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:06.589
pretentiousness--weighing on
every sentence.

00:30:06.589 --> 00:30:12.472
The allusions to Paradise
Lost are part of that

00:30:12.472 --> 00:30:16.318
portentousness.
Now, let me move to

00:30:16.318 --> 00:30:20.235
something smaller,
moving a little later in the

00:30:20.235 --> 00:30:22.960
poetic tradition:
Wordsworth.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.249
In the opening lines of this
novel, we see the line on page

00:30:28.249 --> 00:30:32.079
3, "All history present in that
visage,"

00:30:32.079 --> 00:30:36.279
the face of the kid,
"the child, the father of the

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:37.714
man."
That phrase,

00:30:37.714 --> 00:30:41.467
"The child, the father of the
man," comes from a short,

00:30:41.467 --> 00:30:44.039
little poem by William
Wordsworth.

00:30:44.039 --> 00:30:48.640
It's called "My Heart Leaps up
when I Behold."

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:52.898
My heart leaps up when I
behold / A rainbow in the sky:

00:30:52.898 --> 00:30:57.494
/ So was it when my life began,
/ So is it now I am a man,

00:30:57.494 --> 00:31:01.829
/ So be it when I shall grow
old / Or let me die!

00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:06.805
/ The child is father of the
man: / And I could wish my days

00:31:06.805 --> 00:31:11.190
to be / Bound each to each by
natural piety.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:15.900
This is a lovely little snippet
of a poem.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:20.957
The point of it is to say that
the child, delighted by the

00:31:20.957 --> 00:31:25.693
rainbow, gives you the man,
delighted by the rainbow,

00:31:25.693 --> 00:31:29.154
and he says,
"Let me die if I'm no longer

00:31:29.154 --> 00:31:32.743
delighted,
if I get to be so old that that

00:31:32.743 --> 00:31:36.160
childlike delight in the rainbow
is gone."

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.710
The rainbow comes freighted
with its own biblical literary

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:46.309
history: that is,
it's the sign of God's promise

00:31:46.309 --> 00:31:48.691
to the world,
to humankind,

00:31:48.691 --> 00:31:54.372
that God will no longer send a
flood to wipe out the human race

00:31:54.372 --> 00:32:00.143
as He did in the days of Noah.
So, it is a hopeful sign for

00:32:00.143 --> 00:32:04.811
the fate of humankind,
and it reflects well on God's

00:32:04.811 --> 00:32:07.100
intentions towards us.

00:32:11.599 --> 00:32:16.427
McCarthy's child,
father of the man,

00:32:16.427 --> 00:32:21.849
is a very different sort.
Just read that sentence right

00:32:21.849 --> 00:32:25.577
prior to the allusion:
"He can neither read nor write

00:32:25.577 --> 00:32:29.880
and in him broods already a
taste for mindless violence."

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:35.877
What McCarthy announces here,
in his revision of Wordsworth,

00:32:35.877 --> 00:32:41.467
is that, although to invoke
Milton's Satan is already to

00:32:41.467 --> 00:32:46.549
project us into the realm of
Romantic figures,

00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:51.279
he is rejecting the later
Romanticism of the early

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:55.720
nineteenth century which found
in humankind,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:33:01.808
especially in the child as the
epitome of pure humankind,

00:33:01.808 --> 00:33:07.824
a kind of great hopefulness.
This is not what McCarthy sees

00:33:07.824 --> 00:33:11.884
in humankind.
This is not what the kid gives

00:33:11.884 --> 00:33:16.599
to us, even though we are told,
a little later on,

00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:24.090
on page 4, the child's face is
curiously untouched behind the

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:31.089
scars, the eyes oddly innocent.
What does that innocence mean?

00:33:31.089 --> 00:33:34.402
Is it, here,
an innocence like Wordsworth's

00:33:34.402 --> 00:33:38.502
child, who can behold the
rainbow with joy and a pure

00:33:38.502 --> 00:33:42.130
relation to the world and to a
caring god?

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:47.513
Is it that kind of innocence?
Is it the innocence simply of

00:33:47.513 --> 00:33:51.010
not knowing something?
Is it that kind of innocence?

00:33:51.010 --> 00:33:55.859
Is it an absence of guilt?
Is that what the innocence is?

00:33:55.859 --> 00:33:58.965
These are questions,
again, I'm going to put up on

00:33:58.965 --> 00:34:01.677
the side.
What is the quality of the

00:34:01.677 --> 00:34:04.981
kid's innocence?
This is something I'm going to

00:34:04.981 --> 00:34:08.169
answer on Wednesday,
but I want you to think about

00:34:08.169 --> 00:34:10.785
it.
The allusion to Wordsworth

00:34:10.785 --> 00:34:14.210
causes us to ask that kind of
question.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:19.039
The revision tells us we are in
a much darker world.

00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:23.165
Now, I'm actually going to skip
over some of the biblical

00:34:23.165 --> 00:34:27.586
allusion and trust you to read,
in the first couple of pages,

00:34:27.586 --> 00:34:32.023
just in that first section.
I'd like you reread it and

00:34:32.023 --> 00:34:35.750
think about how the Bible is
woven in there.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:40.500
You see lots of Garden of Eden
imagery there.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.750
You see a parricide,
the image of the murdered

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.688
father.
There is an echo there of Cain

00:34:48.688 --> 00:34:51.269
and Abel, even though they are
brothers.

00:34:51.269 --> 00:34:55.603
There is a sense that this is a
world in which violence and

00:34:55.603 --> 00:34:59.380
murder has already entered.
So, you can think about that.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:04.601
I want to go,
now, to my last in the pile of

00:35:04.601 --> 00:35:07.604
books.
This is an historical source

00:35:07.604 --> 00:35:12.058
called My Confession,
and it is by a man named

00:35:12.058 --> 00:35:16.940
Samuel Chamberlain.
Chamberlain fought for the U.S.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:22.331
in the Mexican War,
and after the war was over he

00:35:22.331 --> 00:35:27.999
joined up with the Glanton Gang.
The Glanton Gang is a

00:35:27.999 --> 00:35:31.170
historical fact,
as far as we know.

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:36.460
It was a gang of scalp hunters
that operated around the border

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:40.969
right after the Mexican War in
the 1840s and '50s.

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:44.438
Sam Chamberlain--I want to show
you--he was quite a remarkable

00:35:44.438 --> 00:35:46.748
guy.
He was from Boston,

00:35:46.748 --> 00:35:51.099
born in New Hampshire,
grew up in Boston.

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:55.612
At sixteen he left Boston and
went out West,

00:35:55.612 --> 00:35:59.389
taking a sort of circuitous
route.

00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:06.024
He went to find his fortune and
to find adventure,

00:36:06.024 --> 00:36:11.440
but he also went with a box of
paints.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.026
And he produced these amazing
watercolors everywhere he went,

00:36:16.026 --> 00:36:20.383
and he wrote this testimony of
his adventures called My

00:36:20.383 --> 00:36:23.449
Confession.
It reads like a picaresque.

00:36:23.449 --> 00:36:28.128
It's full of his own heroism,
all the senoritas that he

00:36:28.128 --> 00:36:32.199
romances, all the great battles
he fights in,

00:36:32.199 --> 00:36:40.340
but he really gives us an
amazing set of paintings.

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.390
You can just see these.
I'm going to show you a couple.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:54.560
While I'm waiting for this
to come up, I'm going to show

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:56.050
you something you can't see on
this web site.

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:00.196
This is the Texas State
Historical Society where these

00:37:00.196 --> 00:37:04.363
documents are kept.
The pages are written-- I don't

00:37:04.363 --> 00:37:09.510
know if you can see this.
This is a reproduction.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:15.186
See, he writes in this gorgeous
hand, and he embellishes all the

00:37:15.186 --> 00:37:19.740
pages with little drawings.
And this is hundreds of pages

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.550
long, with hundreds of
watercolors in it.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:27.036
My bet is that McCarthy
actually saw this manuscript in

00:37:27.036 --> 00:37:30.110
the Texas State Historical
Society.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:33.774
That's where he lived.
That's where he was living when

00:37:33.774 --> 00:37:38.166
he wrote this book.
And it just is amazingly visual

00:37:38.166 --> 00:37:41.373
and gorgeous.
He ended up making three copies

00:37:41.373 --> 00:37:45.876
of this with all its paintings.
When he got back to New England

00:37:45.876 --> 00:37:50.529
he married and he had three
daughters (which he named after

00:37:50.529 --> 00:37:55.342
various senoritas that he had
romanced) and he made a copy of

00:37:55.342 --> 00:37:59.170
My Confession for each,
so there are three of them.

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:01.689
One is at Annapolis;
one is at the Texas State

00:38:01.689 --> 00:38:03.842
Historical Society,
and I think one is with the

00:38:03.842 --> 00:38:04.919
family.
All right.

00:38:04.919 --> 00:38:08.272
So, this isn't giving you
the paintings that I want,

00:38:08.272 --> 00:38:11.320
and I'm going to--These are two
that I took up.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.323
This one on the right-- Well,
we'll do the little one on the

00:38:14.323 --> 00:38:16.216
left.
The one on the left is his

00:38:16.216 --> 00:38:19.583
drawing of the Grand Canyon,
and he claims that it was the

00:38:19.583 --> 00:38:23.069
first ever painting of the Grand
Canyon (and I think this is

00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:27.537
probably false).
That's them crossing through,

00:38:27.537 --> 00:38:30.663
the gang.
This is Judge Holden,

00:38:30.663 --> 00:38:36.610
here, discoursing on evolution
in a very Judge Holden-ly way.

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.942
So, we actually hear about this
sermon on evolution in the

00:38:40.942 --> 00:38:42.642
novel.
Well, here it is in

00:38:42.642 --> 00:38:45.663
Chamberlain's Confession.
Now, I want to read to you

00:38:45.663 --> 00:38:47.200
a little bit from the
Confession.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.740
The second in command,
now left in charge of the camp,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:01.200
was a man of gigantic size who
rejoiced in the name of Holden,

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.804
called Judge Holden of Texas.
Who or what he was no one knew,

00:39:05.804 --> 00:39:09.809
but a more cool-blooded villain
never went unhung.

00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:13.117
He stood six foot six in his
moccasins, had a large,

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:15.711
fleshy frame,
a dull, tallow-colored face

00:39:15.711 --> 00:39:18.370
destitute of hair and all
expression,

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:22.658
always cool and collected.
But when a quarrel took place

00:39:22.658 --> 00:39:26.039
and blood shed,
his hog-like eyes would gleam

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:30.880
with a sullen ferocity worthy of
the countenance of a fiend.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.834
[I'm going to skip a little
bit.]

00:39:32.834 --> 00:39:35.827
Terrible stories were
circulated in camp of horrid

00:39:35.827 --> 00:39:39.186
crimes committed by him when
bearing another name in the

00:39:39.186 --> 00:39:42.755
Cherokee nation in Texas.
And before we left Fronteras,

00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:46.165
a little girl of ten years was
found in the chaparral foully

00:39:46.165 --> 00:39:49.597
violated and murdered.
The mark of a huge hand on her

00:39:49.597 --> 00:39:53.836
little throat pointed out him as
the ravisher as no other man had

00:39:53.836 --> 00:39:56.992
such a hand.
But though all suspected,

00:39:56.992 --> 00:40:00.019
no one charged him with the
crime.

00:40:00.019 --> 00:40:04.530
He was by far the best educated
man in northern Mexico.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.081
He conversed with all in their
own language,

00:40:07.081 --> 00:40:10.622
spoke in several Indian lingos,
at a fandango would take the

00:40:10.622 --> 00:40:14.240
harp or guitar from the hands of
the musicians and charm all with

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.659
his wonderful performance,
out-waltz any poblano of the

00:40:17.659 --> 00:40:21.347
ball, plum centre with rifle or
revolver, a daring horseman

00:40:21.347 --> 00:40:25.224
acquainted with the nature of
all the strange plants and their

00:40:25.224 --> 00:40:27.846
botanical names,
great in geology and

00:40:27.846 --> 00:40:31.257
mineralogy, with all an errant
coward, but not that he

00:40:31.257 --> 00:40:34.860
possessed enough courage to
fight Indians and Mexicans or

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.334
anyone where he had the
advantage and strength stealing

00:40:38.334 --> 00:40:40.789
weapons,
but where the combat would be

00:40:40.789 --> 00:40:42.690
equal he would avoid it if
possible.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:47.989
I hated him at first sight and
he knew it.

00:40:47.989 --> 00:40:51.351
The intellectual beast saw fit
to patronize me in the most

00:40:51.351 --> 00:40:54.123
insulting manner,
lecturing me on the immorality

00:40:54.123 --> 00:40:56.659
of my conduct in drinking and
gambling.

00:40:56.659 --> 00:40:59.557
This was shortly after the
murder of the muchacha,

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:02.217
and when I made an angry reply
he said, "Come,

00:41:02.217 --> 00:41:03.870
Jack.
Don't bear ill will.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.740
Shake hands and make up."
I replied, "No.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.827
I thank you.
Your hand is too large and

00:41:08.827 --> 00:41:11.099
powerful.
It leaves its mark."

00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:14.839
Holden gave me a look out from
his cold, cruel eyes and quietly

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:16.769
said, "You are there,
are you?

00:41:16.769 --> 00:41:20.196
Well, look out where my hand
may squeeze the life out of you

00:41:20.196 --> 00:41:23.423
yet, my young bantam."
I felt like trying my revolver

00:41:23.423 --> 00:41:26.358
on his huge carcass,
but prudence forbid bringing

00:41:26.358 --> 00:41:29.170
matters to a deadly issue at
present.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.460
There is that same
Toadvine-Starbuck moment.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:36.462
It's right in My
Confession, as is

00:41:36.462 --> 00:41:40.976
that particular strange
description of Judge Holden as

00:41:40.976 --> 00:41:45.018
huge and hairless.
Now, in the nineteenth century

00:41:45.018 --> 00:41:48.559
hairless just meant that he
didn't have a beard,

00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:52.563
but McCarthy takes that and
makes it into this really

00:41:52.563 --> 00:41:57.565
freakish character.
It's almost like he's a giant

00:41:57.565 --> 00:42:02.112
infant.
What does it mean that McCarthy

00:42:02.112 --> 00:42:09.221
gets the most powerful character
in the novel so directly from

00:42:09.221 --> 00:42:13.829
this source?
That's one question.

00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:18.324
Second question is:
what does it mean that he's

00:42:18.324 --> 00:42:21.940
actually taking an historical
fact,

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.215
the Glanton Gang and their
adventures, and using these as

00:42:26.215 --> 00:42:30.529
the kernel of his novel,
when--as my little pile of

00:42:30.529 --> 00:42:34.113
books here has
demonstrated--he's totally

00:42:34.113 --> 00:42:38.325
absorbed in the novel's
relationship to literary

00:42:38.325 --> 00:42:41.940
history?
So, what's he doing by

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:47.219
doubling the literary history
with an American history?

00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:51.568
He's pursuing two sets of links
back through time:

00:42:51.568 --> 00:42:56.449
one in the realm of art,
one in the realm of history.

00:42:56.449 --> 00:42:59.760
What's the relationship between
the two?

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.372
When I first read this,
I will say, I was extremely

00:43:08.372 --> 00:43:10.755
surprised.
Are you surprised,

00:43:10.755 --> 00:43:15.445
too, to see that it takes so
directly from Chamberlain's

00:43:15.445 --> 00:43:19.546
manuscript?
The problem is the problem of

00:43:19.546 --> 00:43:22.566
originality.
This is a problem that,

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:27.119
I think, McCarthy's quotation,
that I wrote up on the board,

00:43:27.119 --> 00:43:34.550
points towards:
"The ugly fact is that books

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:40.880
are made out of books."
Why is that an ugly fact?

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:48.043
What's ugly about that?
"The novel depends for its life

00:43:48.043 --> 00:43:52.010
on the novels that have been
written."

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:57.451
Is it ugly because it calls
into question the very principle

00:43:57.451 --> 00:44:00.556
of originality?
This is what someone,

00:44:00.556 --> 00:44:03.409
a reader like Harold Bloom,
might say.

00:44:03.409 --> 00:44:07.960
Harold Bloom argues that it is
the "anxiety of influence" that

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.869
shapes many writers in the
tradition.

00:44:10.869 --> 00:44:14.041
As they take on the great
writers of the past,

00:44:14.041 --> 00:44:16.789
they feel that they are ever
belated,

00:44:16.789 --> 00:44:21.395
that there is no room yet in
the world to push the art form

00:44:21.395 --> 00:44:24.440
further.
Is that why it's an ugly fact?

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:28.240
Is its ugliness,
or the way that word is used in

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.717
this quotation,
is it registering McCarthy's

00:44:31.717 --> 00:44:34.790
anxiety about his own
belatedness?

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:42.493
Can he really be original?
Can he really answer the

00:44:42.493 --> 00:44:50.355
portentous, cosmic aura that he
invokes over and over again in

00:44:50.355 --> 00:44:57.135
the very style of this novel?
The style keeps telling you,

00:44:57.135 --> 00:45:00.739
"Come and look for a deeper
meaning."

00:45:00.739 --> 00:45:04.421
Now, I want to point out
one last thing for you,

00:45:04.421 --> 00:45:08.680
since I do have just the couple
minutes that I will need.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:12.147
This is on 4 and 5.
At the top of 4,

00:45:12.147 --> 00:45:17.970
as the kid moves from Tennessee
down to New Orleans,

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:24.480
and then out to the West,
he moves through the South:

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.788
He sees blacks in the
fields lank and stooped,

00:45:28.788 --> 00:45:33.013
their fingers spiderlike among
the bolls of cotton,

00:45:33.013 --> 00:45:37.909
a shadowed agony in the garden.
[There is some of that Eden

00:45:37.909 --> 00:45:41.859
imagery I was going to point out
to you at more length.]

00:45:41.859 --> 00:45:45.809
Against the sun's declining
figures moving in the slower

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:48.610
dusk across a paper
skyline.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:51.390
The landscape itself is already
an artifact;

00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:55.959
it's paper.
It's as if it's of McCarthy's

00:45:55.959 --> 00:46:00.137
own construction.
But if you look just across the

00:46:00.137 --> 00:46:04.763
page, on 5, this is a tiny
thing, and probably it didn't

00:46:04.763 --> 00:46:08.436
register to you at all.
A week on he is on the

00:46:08.436 --> 00:46:11.727
move again, a few dollars in his
purse that he's earned walking

00:46:11.727 --> 00:46:14.170
the sand roads of the southern
night alone,

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.340
his hands balled in the cotton
pockets of his cheap coat.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:23.949
Do you notice the way the words
are repeating there?

00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:28.371
"Spiderlike among the bolls of
cotton," "his hands balled in

00:46:28.371 --> 00:46:34.019
the cotton pockets of his coat."
It's a tiny, little thing.

00:46:34.019 --> 00:46:37.772
I would argue,
however, that what we're seeing

00:46:37.772 --> 00:46:42.609
here is the way the very style
and tone perpetuates itself,

00:46:42.609 --> 00:46:47.528
out of itself.
So, I want to add a final layer

00:46:47.528 --> 00:46:54.146
in my excavation of allusion,
and here say that he's alluding

00:46:54.146 --> 00:46:58.032
to himself,
that there is a constant

00:46:58.032 --> 00:47:03.693
re-layering that takes the
language and the repetitiousness

00:47:03.693 --> 00:47:07.890
of that language builds within
the text.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.659
There is a lot of anxiety
about origin,

00:47:16.659 --> 00:47:19.409
right here in these couple
pages.

00:47:19.409 --> 00:47:24.137
We're told, "Only now is
it"--as he goes to Texas--"only

00:47:24.137 --> 00:47:28.949
now is the child finally
divested of all he has been."

00:47:28.949 --> 00:47:31.202
And you note,
at the beginning,

00:47:31.202 --> 00:47:35.557
that he is, and his folk are
known for, "hewers of wood and

00:47:35.557 --> 00:47:38.889
drawers of water."
These are the traditional

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:42.786
adjectives given to the sons of
Ham, the hewers of wood and

00:47:42.786 --> 00:47:46.699
drawers of water.
Ham's crime against his father,

00:47:46.699 --> 00:47:49.849
Noah, was that he saw his
father, Noah,

00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:53.225
naked in his tent.
Noah planted a vineyard,

00:47:53.225 --> 00:47:57.245
got drunk, and I guess he was
naked in his tent while he was

00:47:57.245 --> 00:48:01.122
passed out.
Ham happened to peep in and saw

00:48:01.122 --> 00:48:06.631
his father naked.
His two brothers covered the

00:48:06.631 --> 00:48:09.250
father.
The two brothers are therefore

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.489
blessed;
Ham is cursed.

00:48:11.489 --> 00:48:15.519
Why is this a curse-worthy
action?

00:48:15.519 --> 00:48:17.539
Why is this a curse-worthy
mistake?

00:48:17.539 --> 00:48:21.255
I think it's because,
in seeing the father naked,

00:48:21.255 --> 00:48:24.119
you see the mystery of your
origin.

00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:30.112
And so, the kid is likened to
someone cursed for looking upon

00:48:30.112 --> 00:48:33.870
their origin.
There is a sense in which he

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:37.785
can almost understand it.
This is meant to be mystery,

00:48:37.785 --> 00:48:40.768
and yet by looking,
somehow, he is closer to it

00:48:40.768 --> 00:48:44.867
than he should be.
The problem for the kid is to

00:48:44.867 --> 00:48:48.454
divest himself of origin,
to forget it,

00:48:48.454 --> 00:48:53.079
so if Ham is cursed because he
saw his origin,

00:48:53.079 --> 00:48:57.861
the kid's curse lies,
in part, in the divestiture of

00:48:57.861 --> 00:49:00.250
all origin.
He forgets it.

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:04.150
It's not that he sees it;
he forgets it.

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:07.685
And then you can get a
sentence like this:

00:49:07.685 --> 00:49:12.478
"His origins are become remote
as is his destiny and not again

00:49:12.478 --> 00:49:17.113
in all the world's turning will
there be terrain so wild and

00:49:17.113 --> 00:49:21.748
barbarous to try whether the
stuff of creation may be shaped

00:49:21.748 --> 00:49:26.462
to man's will or whether his own
heart is not another kind of

00:49:26.462 --> 00:49:29.915
clay."
I want you to read the sentence

00:49:29.915 --> 00:49:34.023
several times before Wednesday,
and ask yourself if you can

00:49:34.023 --> 00:49:37.210
figure out what it means fully,
all of it.

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:39.389
Parts of it are more clear than
others.

00:49:39.389 --> 00:49:46.071
Think about the balance between
the rhythm of that sentence and

00:49:46.071 --> 00:49:49.855
its content,
the tone, what its tone says to

00:49:49.855 --> 00:49:53.894
you, what its diction says to
you, and what the sentence

00:49:53.894 --> 00:49:57.543
itself actually says to you.
So, that's what I'd like you to

00:49:57.543 --> 00:49:59.821
think about.
And on Wednesday I'm going to

00:49:59.821 --> 00:50:02.988
take this discussion of
allusion, and I'm going to sort

00:50:02.988 --> 00:50:06.449
of ball it up and it'll become
part of another argument,

00:50:06.449 --> 00:50:10.594
and that'll stem from one tiny
detail I'm going to take out of

00:50:10.594 --> 00:50:13.000
the novel.
So that's where I'm going.

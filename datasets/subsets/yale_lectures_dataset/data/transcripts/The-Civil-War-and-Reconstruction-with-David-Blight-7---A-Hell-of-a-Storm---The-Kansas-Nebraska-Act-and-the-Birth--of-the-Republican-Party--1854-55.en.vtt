00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.360
Professor David Blight:
There was trouble in the air.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.867
I left you the other day with
Henry Clay sloshing down some

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:26.140
brandy on a late night in
mid-January 1850,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.022
to try to come up with ways of
solving the great political

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:35.648
challenges they faced between
the sections and over the

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:39.240
expansion of slavery.
They were doing this,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.656
in great part,
because gold had been

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:47.190
discovered in California.
This is an original photograph

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.310
of panners, gold-miners--white,
Asian and who knows,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.270
probably somebody mixed black.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.096
If California wasn't ready for
statehood in 1850,

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:08.358
it's possible there wouldn't
have needed to be a Compromise

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:10.860
of 1850;
but it was.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.193
And already in its inception,
people realized how big

00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:18.042
California was.
And they already realized,

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:20.465
North and South,
that part of it was north of

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:23.439
the Missouri Compromise Line and
part it was south.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.198
Would that vast territory of
California become a free state

00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:28.430
or a slave state?

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.648
The South's greatest spokesman,
its intellectual leader of its

00:01:35.648 --> 00:01:38.629
states' sovereignty and states'
rights position,

00:01:38.629 --> 00:01:43.959
delivered what became known
quickly that year as "The

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.431
Southern Address."
And in it, Calhoun said many

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:50.020
things, warning the country what
the South might do,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.000
or at least the Deep South
might do.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.085
But he captured it in this
ending of the speech:

00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:58.040
"If you," and he's pointing to
Northerners,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.041
"who represent the stronger
portion cannot agree to settle

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.200
on the broad principle of
justice and duty,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.816
say so;
and let the States we both

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:12.770
represent agree to separate and
part in peace.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.475
If you are unwilling we should
part in peace,

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:20.111
tell us so;
and we shall not--and we shall

00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:25.194
know what to do when you reduce
the question to submission or

00:02:25.194 --> 00:02:28.640
resistance.
If you remain silent you will

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.460
compel us to infer by your acts
what you intend.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.732
In that case,
California will become the test

00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:40.274
question.
If you admit her,

00:02:40.274 --> 00:02:44.018
under all the difficulties that
oppose her admission,

00:02:44.018 --> 00:02:48.337
you compel us to infer that you
intend to exclude us from the

00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:52.009
whole of the acquired
territories of the West,

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:54.850
with the intention of
destroying irretrievably the

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.170
equilibrium between the two
sections."

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.852
And one of the oldest ideas in
our political culture is that

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:10.266
great conflict comes when
there's an issue around which

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:13.699
two sides--let's assume there
are two,

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:18.097
sometimes there are more than
two--but if there are two sides

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:24.090
on a great issue of conflict,
when one side or the other

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.551
cannot accept the result;
when a vital interest is

00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.887
somehow at stake that they will
not, or cannot,

00:03:32.887 --> 00:03:36.370
or choose not,
to accept a political outcome.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.190
That's the question in the
1850s: can compromise,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.078
some kind of coalition and
consensus around this question

00:03:49.078 --> 00:03:52.919
of slavery's future--future in
the West,

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.131
future in the American
political culture,

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:59.905
future within the
Constitution--can some kind of

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.190
center hold?

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.342
Now, Clay invited Daniel
Webster to deal with this

00:04:09.342 --> 00:04:13.287
because Webster's obviously the
most--at that point in time

00:04:13.287 --> 00:04:17.639
Daniel Webster was the most
famous Northern Whig politician.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.699
He was from abolitionist
Massachusetts.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.113
He was anti-slavery,
though never a card-carrying

00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:27.592
abolitionist to say the least.
He was a great lawyer,

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:30.926
many said the greatest orator
in the United States--those were

00:04:30.926 --> 00:04:34.259
usually the ones that hadn't
heard Frederick Douglass yet.

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.190
He'd been in Congress since
1823, almost as long as Clay.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.139
He'd been in the Senate since
1844.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.431
He was seen in some ways as the
lion and the spokesman of New

00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:51.175
England.
He had been the great voice in

00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:54.950
the Nullification Crisis debates
of 1830.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.776
He had been a voice of union
but also law enforcement

00:05:02.776 --> 00:05:06.800
then--that famous phrase that he
had become known for,

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.750
"Liberty and union,
now and forever,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.569
one and inseparable."
Webster always seemed to be the

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.770
union man, at the same time he
was an anti-slavery man.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.980
Henry Clay from Kentucky;
founder of the Whig Party;

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.730
candidate for President three
and four times over.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.387
The organizational genius in
some ways behind the Whig Party

00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:35.230
and its so-called national
system,

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.973
the idea of using government
for economic and social change

00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:43.899
in the lives of immigrants and
everybody else.

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:48.729
Clay of Kentucky,
slave-holder--he owned about 60

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:54.588
people--hemp plantation farmer,
original founder of the

00:05:54.588 --> 00:06:01.540
American Colonization Society,
a border state political titan,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.360
with great influence in the
Congress, pulls in Webster and

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.649
says, "Daniel,
we got to save the union,

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:15.403
because look what Calhoun and
company in the Deep South are

00:06:15.403 --> 00:06:18.160
threatening.
What will we do?

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.752
How will we solve this?"
I mentioned the other day that

00:06:23.752 --> 00:06:27.295
when Clay introduced his five
measures, which were known first

00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:30.779
as the Clay Measures and then as
the Compromise Measures,

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:34.728
he stood up in the Senate,
with great theater,

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:39.554
and held a piece of what he
said was George Washington's

00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:43.060
coffin.
What were the issues in 1850?

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.259
I hope you've seen enough of
the outline;

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.500
if not--it's gone for the
moment.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.790
The issues are on the map.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.420
The issues are that California
in the west is ready for

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.686
statehood, overnight,
because of that vast migration

00:07:14.686 --> 00:07:18.840
of miners, by sea,
by land, and by imagination.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.065
There'd always been a brewing
issue in the U.S.

00:07:25.065 --> 00:07:28.838
Congress and in the District of
Columbia about the fact that the

00:07:28.838 --> 00:07:31.594
District of Columbia,
the capital of the United

00:07:31.594 --> 00:07:34.050
States, was a slave trading
center.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:36.293
Northern congressmen,
of all stripes,

00:07:36.293 --> 00:07:39.970
had always been bothered by the
fact that about 2½

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.681
blocks down the street from the
United States Capitol was a huge

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:48.912
slave jail.
People said that when the wind

00:07:48.912 --> 00:07:52.949
was right you could smell it,
on the steps of the Capitol.

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:58.590
Abraham Lincoln in his one term
in the House called it a human

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.854
livery stable.
Foreign visitors would come and

00:08:01.854 --> 00:08:05.481
they would say--they would stand
in awe at that majestic Capitol

00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:08.819
as it was being built and the
dome was being completed,

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:13.696
and then they would ask,
"Where's the slave jail,

00:08:13.696 --> 00:08:17.614
can we see a slave jail?"
So there were a lot of

00:08:17.614 --> 00:08:20.977
Northerners now who were saying,
"Okay, there's going to be some

00:08:20.977 --> 00:08:23.060
big compromise now about
California,

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.142
about slavery in the West.
What are we going to do about

00:08:25.142 --> 00:08:28.736
this?
Let's deal with this question

00:08:28.736 --> 00:08:31.209
too."
Thirdly, there was the question

00:08:31.209 --> 00:08:34.386
of--and this is what Southerners
were exercised about--of

00:08:34.386 --> 00:08:37.564
fugitive slaves escaping into
the North in that so-called

00:08:37.564 --> 00:08:40.778
Underground Railroad.
And the term Underground

00:08:40.778 --> 00:08:44.908
Railroad appears for the first
time openly, over and over,

00:08:44.908 --> 00:08:47.805
in public debate on the floor
of the U.S.

00:08:47.805 --> 00:08:50.674
Congress.
Southerners standing up and

00:08:50.674 --> 00:08:54.520
saying we need a much stronger
Federal Fugitive Slave Act

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.916
requiring the return of fugitive
slaves because they are escaping

00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:01.870
too much in that Underground
Railroad.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.770
They didn't have a clue what it
really was;

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:12.278
didn't matter.
But Southerners wanted fugitive

00:09:12.278 --> 00:09:17.019
slaves retrieved to them by law
under Federal enforcement,

00:09:17.019 --> 00:09:22.368
no questions asked.
And then there was the problem

00:09:22.368 --> 00:09:25.538
of Texas now.
It doesn't quite show it on

00:09:25.538 --> 00:09:28.256
this map properly,
but the other day you remember

00:09:28.256 --> 00:09:31.371
the map of Texas--the boundaries
of Texas had never been

00:09:31.371 --> 00:09:37.000
determined--to the Mexicans,
much less to the Americans.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.671
And the idea here now was
to--how would you kind of divide

00:09:40.671 --> 00:09:43.388
up Texas?
There was no New Mexico or

00:09:43.388 --> 00:09:48.255
Arizona yet, it's just this vast
territory called the New Mexico

00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:52.015
Territory.
The idea was if you moved back

00:09:52.015 --> 00:09:56.240
the border of Texas about three
or 400 miles,

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:59.021
and you placed it where it
actually is today,

00:09:59.021 --> 00:10:01.169
you would open up new
territory,

00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:04.657
lots of it, to the
establishment of at least one

00:10:04.657 --> 00:10:08.731
new, if not two new states,
and those states in the

00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:12.491
Southern imagination would,
in all likelihood,

00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:15.750
be slave states--they were
southern.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.960
What to do with the Texas
boundary?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:25.570
Now, Daniel Webster's support
of this came at some price.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.350
It came at a huge price for his
own career.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:32.615
The five measures that came out
of their discussions--they

00:10:32.615 --> 00:10:35.480
weren't alone but they really
did conceive this.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.621
The five parts of the
Compromise of 1850 will be on

00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:44.256
your citizenship test.
You shouldn't have U.S.

00:10:44.256 --> 00:10:47.349
citizenship if you can't name
the five parts of the Compromise

00:10:47.349 --> 00:10:50.442
of 1850--I've always believed
that--and the three parts of the

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.929
Kansas-Nebraska Act;
that should be a test of

00:10:52.929 --> 00:10:54.951
citizenship.
No Lithuanian should ever get

00:10:54.951 --> 00:10:56.548
U.S.
citizenship without being able

00:10:56.548 --> 00:10:58.990
to name the five parts of the
Compromise of 1850.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.508
Never mind.
[laughter]

00:11:00.508 --> 00:11:03.629
California would be admitted as
a free state.

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:06.419
Clay said there's no way around
this, if they hold a referendum

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:08.490
in California it's going to be a
free state;

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:14.093
the people who've gone there
are all, they're all little

00:11:14.093 --> 00:11:16.150
people.
There are all these miners and

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.405
these panners,
they're immigrants,

00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:19.610
they're people from Germany
who've come across the sea,

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.978
all in one year,
to go find gold in California,

00:11:22.978 --> 00:11:26.200
and they're not going to be
slave-holders.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.629
All right, California will be
admitted as a free state.

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:33.645
But now, remember what Calhoun
had said--so what are you going

00:11:33.645 --> 00:11:38.209
to give the South?
In return the South is going to

00:11:38.209 --> 00:11:41.034
get a whole new,
much stronger,

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:45.843
Federal Fugitive Slave Act,
the most notorious and

00:11:45.843 --> 00:11:50.169
controversial aspect of the
Compromise of 1850.

00:11:50.169 --> 00:11:53.608
Secondly, Clay said to Webster,
"Let's abolish the slave trade

00:11:53.608 --> 00:11:56.700
in the District of Columbia.
We have Federal jurisdiction

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.931
over that;
the Congress has jurisdiction

00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:01.714
over the District,
let's abolish the slave trade,

00:12:01.714 --> 00:12:04.440
let's get the slave jails out
of Washington.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.650
Northerners will like that."
Webster said "Yeah.

00:12:12.009 --> 00:12:14.069
Let's move the boundary back
three, 400 miles"--it was really

00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:16.198
about 350 miles--"let's open up
a whole new part of the Mexican

00:12:16.198 --> 00:12:18.367
Session,
with a possible establishment

00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:21.971
of new slave states;
let's let Southerners dream of

00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:26.090
two and three more states,
and four to six more U.S.

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.340
senators in the next three to
five years.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.902
Let's let them feel secure that
California may come in as a free

00:12:33.902 --> 00:12:38.393
state and get two new senators
and the number will now be 16 to

00:12:38.393 --> 00:12:42.241
15,
free to slave states"--people

00:12:42.241 --> 00:12:45.134
were counting.
The idea was "yes,

00:12:45.134 --> 00:12:48.693
but maybe the South gets two or
three out of the Mexican

00:12:48.693 --> 00:12:49.470
Session."

00:12:53.049 --> 00:12:56.003
And then lastly how would
slavery be determined in that

00:12:56.003 --> 00:12:57.771
southwest;
the big issue,

00:12:57.771 --> 00:13:00.710
how do you do it,
by what principle?

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:07.306
Clay said popular sovereignty,
let the people have a

00:13:07.306 --> 00:13:12.610
referendum and vote--liberal
democracy.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.620
So that statehood for any
territory in the Mexican

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:23.346
Session, except for California
here--this is the stuff of

00:13:23.346 --> 00:13:27.050
compromise,
don't look for hard principles

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:31.245
here--except for California,
everything else in the Mexican

00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:35.080
Session will be determined on
popular sovereignty.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.105
The people who settled the
territory at some stage of the

00:13:38.105 --> 00:13:40.320
territorial process--it could be
early,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.760
it could be late--will vote
whether slavery shall exist.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:52.009
So look at the five measures.
California will be a free state;

00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:55.470
slave trade--trade,
not slavery itself--will be

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.480
abolished in the District of
Columbia.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.370
Two issues the North will like.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.964
The Texas boundary moved back,
opened a new territory,

00:14:06.964 --> 00:14:10.320
new possible southern states,
and that Fugitive Slave Act.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.419
Two measures Southerners would
really like.

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:15.276
And by the way,
when Clay suggested the

00:14:15.276 --> 00:14:17.720
Fugitive Slave Act to Webster,
Webster says "No,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.032
no, no, I can't take that home
to Massachusetts,

00:14:21.032 --> 00:14:23.500
it won't fly,
you can't do that."

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.200
Clay said, "You have to do
that."

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.940
Webster said, "I can't do that."
Clay said, "You have to do that;

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.889
have some more brandy."
Webster said, "Okay."

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:36.947
[Laughter]
I don't know how much brandy

00:14:36.947 --> 00:14:40.197
they drank.
And popular sovereignty of

00:14:40.197 --> 00:14:42.370
course, it's American democracy,
let them vote;

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:46.164
it's an appeal to both sides,
two for each side and one for

00:14:46.164 --> 00:14:46.950
everybody.

00:14:51.009 --> 00:14:54.680
It is a great compromise,
in a sense, but how is it

00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:00.033
actually passed is crucial;
and of course its substance is

00:15:00.033 --> 00:15:02.497
crucial.
The way it was finally passed

00:15:02.497 --> 00:15:05.132
is that once--and by the way,
there was no certainly

00:15:05.132 --> 00:15:06.940
whatsoever that this would work.

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:14.913
After Clay initiated the debate
with an emotional appeal for

00:15:14.913 --> 00:15:19.963
union, Daniel Webster spoke in
what became known in his career

00:15:19.963 --> 00:15:24.929
and in American history as the
"7^(th) of March Speech."

00:15:24.929 --> 00:15:29.882
He held forth for three hours
in one of his classic

00:15:29.882 --> 00:15:33.360
philippics.
It began with the famous lines,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.386
"I wish to speak today not as a
Massachusetts man nor as a

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:39.929
northern man,
but as an American.

00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:43.480
I speak today for the
preservation of the Union."

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.655
And he appealed to his fellow
Northerners to vote for the

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:51.681
Fugitive Slave--to vote to make
northern states legally

00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:55.408
complicit in the return of
fugitive slaves in their

00:15:55.408 --> 00:15:59.514
neighborhoods.
He got groans and he got jeers

00:15:59.514 --> 00:16:03.262
and he got cheers.
Everybody said one of the

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:06.443
greatest speeches ever made in
the U.S.

00:16:06.443 --> 00:16:10.909
Senate;
and it ruined Webster's career.

00:16:10.909 --> 00:16:14.593
Poets started writing about,
as Wittier did,

00:16:14.593 --> 00:16:19.723
"the Devil and Daniel Webster."
Calhoun was unable to deliver

00:16:19.723 --> 00:16:24.250
his speech--it was the 4^(th) of
March--he was too sick;

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:29.595
he will be dead by the fall.
It was delivered by James

00:16:29.595 --> 00:16:33.420
Mason, his colleague.
Calhoun was carried into the

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.750
U.S.
Senate in a chair;

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:38.691
he couldn't walk,
they literally carried him in,

00:16:38.691 --> 00:16:42.300
sat him down.
He stared at his shoes,

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:47.717
while Mason delivered his
speech in which Calhoun said

00:16:47.717 --> 00:16:52.009
that the South had to stand now
as one,

00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:55.884
for a slave society and for
states' rights and for the

00:16:55.884 --> 00:17:00.490
protection of what he constantly
argued were minority rights.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:10.932
Calhoun's speech--arguably,
I think from an interpretative

00:17:10.932 --> 00:17:14.973
mode now--frightened,
frightened--especially some

00:17:14.973 --> 00:17:18.960
Northerners, into voting for a
compromise they hated.

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:25.525
It may have even frightened
some border state Democrats and

00:17:25.525 --> 00:17:30.960
Whigs, to vote for this thing,
some of which they hated.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.652
Like any great compromise--if
any of you have ever been on

00:17:33.652 --> 00:17:36.714
major--political committees,
dorm committees and so on,

00:17:36.714 --> 00:17:40.321
you got to pass something,
but you got two or three things

00:17:40.321 --> 00:17:42.553
on the Bill.
And there are these people who

00:17:42.553 --> 00:17:44.735
hate item number one,
and these people who hate item

00:17:44.735 --> 00:17:47.259
number two, and these people who
hate item number three.

00:17:47.259 --> 00:17:50.420
What happens if you vote on all
three at the same time?

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.289
Everybody's got something to
vote against.

00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:57.579
So the way the Compromise of
1850 was passed--and it was

00:17:57.579 --> 00:18:00.464
passed largely by the young
Stephen A.

00:18:00.464 --> 00:18:03.740
Douglas, who took over the
management.

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:08.786
He was about 38-years-old at
this point, Senator from

00:18:08.786 --> 00:18:12.960
Illinois, a young titan--small
as he was,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.406
five foot six--a young titan of
the Democratic Party from

00:18:17.406 --> 00:18:21.106
Illinois.
He was really the parliamentary

00:18:21.106 --> 00:18:26.029
manager in the midst of the
debates from March into the

00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:31.022
summer of 1850.
There were threats of disunion

00:18:31.022 --> 00:18:37.505
from Southerners every other
day--brave threats in Southern

00:18:37.505 --> 00:18:41.174
newspapers.
So what Douglas did is a

00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:43.980
classic parliamentary maneuver.

00:18:47.019 --> 00:18:51.760
He voted on each bill
separately and ultimately called

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:56.143
it the Omnibus Bill,
and in each case managed just

00:18:56.143 --> 00:18:59.900
enough of a narrow
majority--getting enough

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.229
Northerners,
especially Northern Democrats,

00:19:04.229 --> 00:19:10.029
to vote for that Fugitive Slave
Act, which they tended to hate,

00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:14.048
and then just enough
Southern--what's left of the

00:19:14.048 --> 00:19:19.070
Whigs--to vote for the end of
the slave trade in the District

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:25.091
of Columbia.
And it passed in early August

00:19:25.091 --> 00:19:27.915
1850.
Henry Clay, ill,

00:19:27.915 --> 00:19:33.019
terminally sick,
had gone home to Kentucky.

00:19:33.019 --> 00:19:34.901
He'll be out of the picture and
out of American history before

00:19:34.901 --> 00:19:38.066
the end of the year.
Calhoun was dying at that very

00:19:38.066 --> 00:19:41.630
moment--was dead,
I believe, by September.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.527
Webster was now to be denounced
politically forever in his own

00:19:45.527 --> 00:19:48.529
political party and in his own
Massachusetts.

00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:52.537
But the Compromise passed and
in some ways the nation

00:19:52.537 --> 00:19:54.850
celebrated, or so it seemed.

00:19:58.059 --> 00:20:00.976
The Compromise of 1850 did,
in some ways,

00:20:00.976 --> 00:20:04.550
save the Union,
at least at that point in time.

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:11.778
But as David Potter,
the best historian of this

00:20:11.778 --> 00:20:14.526
we've ever had,
said, it was far more--and it's

00:20:14.526 --> 00:20:17.752
the best way to remember it I
think--it was far more an

00:20:17.752 --> 00:20:20.619
armistice than it really was a
compromise.

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:23.710
It began to collapse almost as
fast as it passed.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:27.449
There were huge rallies and
marches in northern cities

00:20:27.449 --> 00:20:30.130
celebrating the saving of the
Union.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.177
People were frightened;
I mean, business interests in

00:20:33.177 --> 00:20:36.410
the north--not just in New York
City where the banks all were,

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:39.646
but now in this colossus of
Chicago, this burgeoning

00:20:39.646 --> 00:20:42.744
railroad center in the West,
in Cincinnati,

00:20:42.744 --> 00:20:46.414
Detroit--worried,
what if there is disunion,

00:20:46.414 --> 00:20:50.530
what happens to the economy,
what happens to trade?

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:58.693
So there were great rallies.
At the same time,

00:20:58.693 --> 00:21:01.001
the State of Georgia met its
legislature by December 1850 and

00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:03.270
passed what they called the
Georgia Platform and sent it all

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.769
around the rest of the Deep
South.

00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:08.240
And it said they--it said the
State of Georgia gave only its

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.299
conditional acceptance to the
compromise measures,

00:21:11.299 --> 00:21:17.119
waiting to see whether the
North acted in good faith.

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:20.069
In other words,
"we don't trust you."

00:21:20.069 --> 00:21:22.587
Some Northern State
legislatures said,

00:21:22.587 --> 00:21:24.882
"oh really?"
And they passed resolutions

00:21:24.882 --> 00:21:27.120
saying "we don't think we trust
you either."

00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:38.039
There were vehement protests
against the Fugitive Slave Act.

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:41.553
The Fugitive Slave Act,
above all else,

00:21:41.553 --> 00:21:45.900
in this crisis,
caused much further conflict.

00:21:49.009 --> 00:21:52.588
It led directly to an estimated
20,000 African-American free

00:21:52.588 --> 00:21:54.832
blacks--well,
free blacks and fugitive

00:21:54.832 --> 00:21:57.684
slaves,
so many of them--living in the

00:21:57.684 --> 00:22:01.106
northern states--and in some
cases, whole church

00:22:01.106 --> 00:22:05.475
congregations from cities like
Philadelphia and Boston--moved

00:22:05.475 --> 00:22:11.989
north of the border into Canada,
between 1850 and roughly 1857,

00:22:11.989 --> 00:22:19.502
'58, when there was another
small wave, after the Dred Scott

00:22:19.502 --> 00:22:22.127
decision.
This will lead now to

00:22:22.127 --> 00:22:24.895
the--established in that
Fugitive Slave Act of special

00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:29.500
Federal magistrates whose job,
whose sole job it was now--this

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:35.539
is a whole new level of Federal
adjudication of fugitive slaves.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:39.523
Magistrates were now appointed
to go all over the north to

00:22:39.523 --> 00:22:43.843
retrieve fugitive slaves--well,
to set up a police apparatus to

00:22:43.843 --> 00:22:47.351
retrieve fugitive slaves,
and then to conduct courts to

00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:51.184
determine their identity.
And in the Fugitive Slave Act

00:22:51.184 --> 00:22:54.172
itself it determined,
or it said, that those

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:58.271
magistrates would be paid twice
as much money--they actually

00:22:58.271 --> 00:23:02.578
would be paid $10.00 for every
fugitive slave they convicted of

00:23:02.578 --> 00:23:06.400
being that person and sent them
back to slavery,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.240
and $5.00 for every acquittal.

00:23:13.009 --> 00:23:14.920
Now I know $5.00 doesn't seem
like much, but on the face of

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.057
that you look at that and think,
"Now wait a second,

00:23:17.057 --> 00:23:20.215
this is blind justice--you're
going to give me twice as much

00:23:20.215 --> 00:23:22.250
money to convict you as acquit
you?

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:25.820
Hey, I need a meal too."

00:23:32.019 --> 00:23:33.644
It led now to famous fugitive
slave rescues,

00:23:33.644 --> 00:23:35.420
like the rescue of Jerry
McHenry in Syracuse,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.223
New York in 1851,
in a violent rescue by

00:23:38.223 --> 00:23:42.535
abolitionists who spirited--who
killed one of his captors and

00:23:42.535 --> 00:23:46.485
carted him off to Canada.
It led to the famous rescue of

00:23:46.485 --> 00:23:50.339
Shadrach Minkins in early 1852
in Boston, a fugitive slave from

00:23:50.339 --> 00:23:53.883
Virginia who was working in an
abolitionist coffeehouse in

00:23:53.883 --> 00:23:55.869
Boston,
retrieved by slave catchers,

00:23:55.869 --> 00:23:57.730
taken to a jail,
broken out of that jail.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:01.503
One of the jailers murdered on
the spot by a mob of

00:24:01.503 --> 00:24:04.220
abolitionists led by Lewis
Hayden,

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.709
himself a fugitive slave from
Kentucky, who lived in Beacon

00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:13.663
Hill in Boston and dared Federal
magistrates to come to his house

00:24:13.663 --> 00:24:17.997
and try to retrieve Shadrack
Minkins by putting an entire

00:24:17.997 --> 00:24:21.395
posse on the street,
and a keg of gun powder in

00:24:21.395 --> 00:24:23.845
front of his door,
which he threatened he would

00:24:23.845 --> 00:24:26.029
blow up if any magistrate got
near it.

00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:28.587
And that night they spirited
Shadrach off to Concord,

00:24:28.587 --> 00:24:31.242
Massachusetts where the
descendents of abolitionists to

00:24:31.242 --> 00:24:33.799
this day like to argue which
house he stayed in,

00:24:33.799 --> 00:24:38.717
and then off across Route 2,
across northern Massachusetts

00:24:38.717 --> 00:24:43.548
and on up into Canada where
Shadrach remained the rest of

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:46.740
his life as a grocer in
Montreal.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.325
And there were many,
many other fugitive slave

00:24:49.325 --> 00:24:51.738
rescues now.
There was a fugitive slave

00:24:51.738 --> 00:24:54.460
rescue at Christiana,
Pennsylvania in 1851.

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:58.539
It was really at a farm.
A slaveholder named Gorsuch and

00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:03.851
a posse of only five or six men
cornered a group of his former

00:25:03.851 --> 00:25:06.900
slaves, four of them,
in a barn.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.168
A group of abolitionists,
black and white,

00:25:10.168 --> 00:25:14.250
defended them in a gun battle.
One of Gorsuch's sons was

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:17.630
killed.
The fugitive slaves escaped.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:21.319
They ended up going across
upstate New York.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:25.416
Two of them ended up in
Frederick Douglass's house in

00:25:25.416 --> 00:25:28.747
Rochester, New York.
Douglass drove them personally

00:25:28.747 --> 00:25:30.930
in a carriage to the wharf on
Lake Erie.

00:25:35.039 --> 00:25:38.993
And when he bid them goodbye,
one of them gave him the

00:25:38.993 --> 00:25:43.021
revolver that he had used at
Christiana, a memento that

00:25:43.021 --> 00:25:45.930
Douglass kept the rest of his
life.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:54.579
Resistance to slavery was now
direct, sometimes violent.

00:25:54.579 --> 00:25:57.549
The Underground Railroad had
become an over ground railroad.

00:25:57.549 --> 00:26:01.459
It was no longer caught up in
the romance of a whole lot of

00:26:01.459 --> 00:26:04.559
people spiriting people to
secret hideaways.

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:07.970
It was sometimes now a matter
of gun violence.

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:13.253
And one could argue that the
most important thing to happen

00:26:13.253 --> 00:26:14.759
in the wake of the Fugitive
Slave Act,

00:26:14.759 --> 00:26:19.733
and therefore the Compromise of
1850, was the publication of

00:26:19.733 --> 00:26:23.406
Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Harriet Beecher Stowe,

00:26:23.406 --> 00:26:25.946
that brilliant,
very short, little woman,

00:26:25.946 --> 00:26:30.009
who had lived for quite awhile
with her husband Calvin Stowe,

00:26:30.009 --> 00:26:31.761
who was a theologian teaching
in Cincinnati,

00:26:31.761 --> 00:26:34.410
had lived in a house on a hill
in Cincinnati for several years,

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.271
where she first met slave
women--where she first met

00:26:37.271 --> 00:26:39.740
fugitive slaves coming through
Cincinnati,

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:40.740
and may have hid a few.

00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:46.768
Heard their voices,
tried to learn their dialect,

00:26:46.768 --> 00:26:50.019
and wrote the greatest novel of
the nineteenth century,

00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:52.568
and still on any list,
any short list,

00:26:52.568 --> 00:26:56.701
of the best selling works of
literature in the history of the

00:26:56.701 --> 00:26:57.390
world.

00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:03.806
That sugar-coated,
anti-slavery story of several

00:27:03.806 --> 00:27:05.769
characters--Eliza,
young Eliza,

00:27:05.769 --> 00:27:09.507
light-skinned with her baby,
escaping across the Ohio,

00:27:09.507 --> 00:27:12.680
jumping from iceberg to iceberg
to iceberg.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.760
The Ohio doesn't have icebergs
anymore;

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.603
didn't have many then either.
Or Uncle Tom himself,

00:27:21.603 --> 00:27:25.777
the most important Christ-like
figure in all of American

00:27:25.777 --> 00:27:29.095
literature.
Harriet Stowe wrote a brilliant

00:27:29.095 --> 00:27:32.369
book, whatever anyone wants to
say about it.

00:27:32.369 --> 00:27:36.670
She made everybody complicitous
in the slave story.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:40.160
The most despicable character
in the book is Miss Ophelia who

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.755
was born in Vermont,
who's racist to the core,

00:27:42.755 --> 00:27:45.912
who can't stand black people
and goes down South preaching at

00:27:45.912 --> 00:27:48.069
Southerners what's wrong with
slavery,

00:27:48.069 --> 00:27:51.569
at the same time she can't get
near black people.

00:27:51.569 --> 00:27:55.985
And in some ways the most
admirable character in that book

00:27:55.985 --> 00:27:59.905
was a Southern slave holder.
And actually the most evil

00:27:59.905 --> 00:28:03.404
character--the most heinous
character is Miss Ophelia--but

00:28:03.404 --> 00:28:06.780
the most evil character,
of course, is Simon Legree;

00:28:10.019 --> 00:28:13.559
and Simon Legree was himself
from New England.

00:28:13.559 --> 00:28:19.075
The whole world was suddenly
reading a work of fiction about

00:28:19.075 --> 00:28:23.227
slavery.
It sold 300,000 copies in the

00:28:23.227 --> 00:28:29.772
first year, by far broke every
sales record of any book ever

00:28:29.772 --> 00:28:32.990
published, ever,
anywhere.

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.886
Reprinted into at least 20
languages in its first five

00:28:36.886 --> 00:28:40.232
years of existence.
Made into stage plays within

00:28:40.232 --> 00:28:43.763
two years.
It brought an awareness to the

00:28:43.763 --> 00:28:46.870
slavery problem as never before.

00:28:51.009 --> 00:28:55.102
And in the election,
the Congressional off-year

00:28:55.102 --> 00:28:58.839
elections of 1852,
for every four votes,

00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:04.520
for every four votes cast for
Franklin Pierce--the Democrat,

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:09.720
who will win--one copy of
Uncle Tom's Cabin sold

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:15.082
somewhere in the United States.
I mean, name a book today that

00:29:15.082 --> 00:29:17.340
we could even imagine doing
that.

00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:23.445
Would that there was a novel
[laughs]

00:29:23.445 --> 00:29:27.030
that our electorate was
electrified by in some way.

00:29:34.019 --> 00:29:40.815
Now, in the wake of the
Compromise of 1850 the country,

00:29:40.815 --> 00:29:45.849
now though, had to face this
question,

00:29:45.849 --> 00:29:48.665
not just what you're going to
do with the Mexican Session

00:29:48.665 --> 00:29:51.230
territories--that's going to
take a little while.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.515
Northerners,
a lot of Northerners are pissed

00:29:53.515 --> 00:29:56.598
off about the nature of the Utah
Territory Bill and the New

00:29:56.598 --> 00:30:01.218
Mexico Territory Bill,
because there are--Southerners

00:30:01.218 --> 00:30:06.940
immediately propose slave
territories for Utah and New

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:09.624
Mexico.
But the real question,

00:30:09.624 --> 00:30:13.418
by 1853 and early 1854,
was all of the territory that

00:30:13.418 --> 00:30:16.993
was left of the Louisiana
Purchase--the Kansas and

00:30:16.993 --> 00:30:21.788
Nebraska Territories,
which is simply what they were

00:30:21.788 --> 00:30:25.828
at that point in time.
Now, it is worth stopping for a

00:30:25.828 --> 00:30:29.289
moment to realize that not every
American woke up in 1851,

00:30:29.289 --> 00:30:34.996
'52, '53, and worried every
moment of every day about the

00:30:34.996 --> 00:30:39.239
expansion of slavery.
They are worried about it,

00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:41.942
and it proves to us,
without question,

00:30:41.942 --> 00:30:45.594
that there was a political
crisis abrewing that the

00:30:45.594 --> 00:30:47.640
electorate cared about.

00:30:51.009 --> 00:30:53.904
But it's worth remembering that
a lot of Americans were

00:30:53.904 --> 00:30:56.531
preoccupied with the same things
they always were:

00:30:56.531 --> 00:31:00.811
price of wheat,
a sick cow, wages at a textile

00:31:00.811 --> 00:31:05.920
mill, a son who wants to marry
and needs land,

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.078
a daughter who wants to marry
an Irishman, or,

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:16.007
most of all,
all those Catholics arriving in

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:21.844
New York City and Philadelphia.
Huge numbers of Irish

00:31:21.844 --> 00:31:25.926
Catholics--they're going to
Catholicize America,

00:31:25.926 --> 00:31:30.096
they're going to turn every
small outhouse into a

00:31:30.096 --> 00:31:32.832
confessional.
We laugh today,

00:31:32.832 --> 00:31:37.366
it's easy to laugh at this,
but nativism caught hold in the

00:31:37.366 --> 00:31:42.057
early 1850s--more on this a bit
later with the breakup of the

00:31:42.057 --> 00:31:46.670
American party system as we take
it through the 1850s.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:49.295
But a lot of Americans were
really worried about those

00:31:49.295 --> 00:31:49.890
Catholics.

00:31:53.009 --> 00:31:56.715
But the Kansas-Nebraska Act--or
the establishment now of the

00:31:56.715 --> 00:32:00.043
territories of Kansas and
Nebraska and what to do with

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:03.811
them--was front and center on
the agenda of the United States

00:32:03.811 --> 00:32:08.045
Congress by late 1853.
In the wake now of numerous of

00:32:08.045 --> 00:32:11.674
these celebrated,
violent rescues of fugitive

00:32:11.674 --> 00:32:14.341
slaves,
the attempts to enforce the

00:32:14.341 --> 00:32:18.568
Fugitive Slave Act in some parts
of the north where it was very

00:32:18.568 --> 00:32:21.944
successfully prosecuted,
and dozens and dozens and

00:32:21.944 --> 00:32:25.259
dozens of fugitive slaves were
returned to the south.

00:32:25.259 --> 00:32:28.480
But in some celebrated cases
they weren't.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.546
Quickly.
The most celebrated case of all

00:32:36.546 --> 00:32:40.058
came in the spring of 1854 at
the very time Congress is

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:43.569
debating this thing called the
Kansas-Nebraska Act,

00:32:43.569 --> 00:32:46.869
and people are politically
waiting with baited breath to

00:32:46.869 --> 00:32:49.930
find out what are they actually
going to do here?

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:55.081
We had the rescue in Boston of
a fugitive slave named Anthony

00:32:55.081 --> 00:32:59.460
Burns, who was a young guy in
his early twenties.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.140
He had escaped out of Virginia,
up to Boston by sea.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:07.892
He too was working in--actually
a store at one point,

00:33:07.892 --> 00:33:10.490
in a coffee shop at another
point.

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:14.241
He was even distributing copies
of William Lloyd Garrison's

00:33:14.241 --> 00:33:18.521
Liberator.
He hadn't been there even a

00:33:18.521 --> 00:33:24.059
year and slave catchers found
him, captured him.

00:33:24.059 --> 00:33:27.411
Now, after Shadrach Minkins got
out of Boston in 1852,

00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:31.141
the Anthony Burns rendition
case captured the imagination of

00:33:31.141 --> 00:33:33.600
the nation,
because Franklin Pierce,

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.000
President of the United States,
moved Federal troops,

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.834
about 3000 of them,
into the streets of Boston to

00:33:39.834 --> 00:33:43.082
guard the courthouse and to
guard the jail and make sure

00:33:43.082 --> 00:33:48.272
nobody broke Anthony Burns out.
It became a test case for the

00:33:48.272 --> 00:33:52.039
Democratic Party of
Massachusetts.

00:33:52.039 --> 00:33:54.206
And on the day Anthony Burns
was marched--he was

00:33:54.206 --> 00:33:57.064
convicted--marched from the jail
down to the wharf and put on a

00:33:57.064 --> 00:33:58.769
ship back to slavery in
Virginia,

00:33:58.769 --> 00:34:01.188
the abolitionist community,
black and white,

00:34:01.188 --> 00:34:03.270
of Boston and all of
Massachusetts,

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.401
gathered in Boston.
They held an all-night vigil

00:34:06.401 --> 00:34:10.636
with candlelight outside of the
jail and they draped the streets

00:34:10.636 --> 00:34:14.163
of Boston,
or some of the streets,

00:34:14.163 --> 00:34:17.510
in black crepe,
in mourning.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:22.719
Burns was sent back to Virginia.
His story is amazing though.

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:29.311
His owner then sold him--he was
too famous--sold him to North

00:34:29.311 --> 00:34:32.239
Carolina.
And one day a white woman in

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.679
North Carolina wrote a letter to
her sister in Amherst,

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:41.315
Massachusetts and said,
"Helen, that slave named Burns

00:34:41.315 --> 00:34:46.717
that they captured up in Boston,
he's living on the farm next

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:49.099
door.
Isn't that interesting?"

00:34:49.099 --> 00:34:53.163
And her sister wrote from the
First Baptist Church of Amherst,

00:34:53.163 --> 00:34:55.960
Massachusetts,
back to her sister and said,

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.746
"Really?
What if we could raise some

00:34:59.746 --> 00:35:03.331
money to purchase him?
Would you talk to your

00:35:03.331 --> 00:35:04.770
neighbors?"
She talked to her neighbors.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:06.785
One thing led to another.
Abolitionists,

00:35:06.785 --> 00:35:09.375
beginning in Amherst,
Massachusetts and then around

00:35:09.375 --> 00:35:12.518
the State of Massachusetts,
raised the money,

00:35:12.518 --> 00:35:16.722
made the offer,
and Anthony Burns' freedom was

00:35:16.722 --> 00:35:22.900
sold.
And he came North, by 1856.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.938
He first arrived in Amherst,
Massachusetts where he was

00:35:25.938 --> 00:35:28.314
celebrated.
They took him out on the

00:35:28.314 --> 00:35:29.480
road--Exhibit A.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:37.881
Then he went to Canada,
and he died in 1860 prematurely

00:35:37.881 --> 00:35:41.760
of disease--lonely,
lost, almost unknown.

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:48.935
But it was in that environment
now, that Congress has to decide

00:35:48.935 --> 00:35:50.710
what to do with Kansas and
Nebraska.

00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:54.623
Now here was the situation.
It was in part a big deal

00:35:54.623 --> 00:35:59.848
because what was firing the
American imagination now was not

00:35:59.848 --> 00:36:04.010
just the west,
but it was the railroad west.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.106
Who would build these
railroads, where would they be

00:36:06.106 --> 00:36:08.119
built, and where would its
eastern terminus be?

00:36:08.119 --> 00:36:12.535
Would the eastern terminus of
the transcontinental railroad be

00:36:12.535 --> 00:36:14.996
in the North,
Chicago--or maybe St.

00:36:14.996 --> 00:36:18.833
Louis, in a slave state--or
maybe further south in New

00:36:18.833 --> 00:36:22.385
Orleans, or maybe Memphis?
Or maybe there'd be two of

00:36:22.385 --> 00:36:25.046
them--maybe you could have a
compromised transcontinental

00:36:25.046 --> 00:36:28.078
railroad built--two of them.
Well then people said,

00:36:28.078 --> 00:36:32.258
"no, wait, it's going to be
hard enough to build one of them

00:36:32.258 --> 00:36:35.931
over those mountains."
The Chairman of the Senate

00:36:35.931 --> 00:36:39.516
Territories Committee,
a very powerful position in

00:36:39.516 --> 00:36:42.150
these years, was Stephen
Douglas.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:50.318
He's now about 40-years-old in
1854, a political genius with a

00:36:50.318 --> 00:36:55.442
few terrible flaws.
Douglas wanted the terminus of

00:36:55.442 --> 00:36:59.219
the transcontinental railroad to
be in Illinois,

00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:06.729
in Chicago, and to go across
the north to the northwest into

00:37:06.729 --> 00:37:11.365
northern California.
Douglas's approach to slavery

00:37:11.365 --> 00:37:13.579
though is terribly important
here.

00:37:13.579 --> 00:37:17.659
It is in some ways,
all of the story.

00:37:17.659 --> 00:37:22.004
Stephen Douglas believes that
climate would solve the problems

00:37:22.004 --> 00:37:24.040
of slavery.
He's famous for all these

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.440
speeches he would make where he
would say, "you know,

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.492
if the soil is good and the
temperatures are right,

00:37:31.492 --> 00:37:35.030
then slavery will probably
exist.

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:37.519
Where the soil is not proper
and the temperatures aren't

00:37:37.519 --> 00:37:40.100
right, or if you've got
mountains, slavery won't exist.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:44.429
Climate will solve the problem."
Now wouldn't that be great?

00:37:44.429 --> 00:37:47.336
We'll just lift--all of our
great political troubles are

00:37:47.336 --> 00:37:49.820
just lifted off our shoulders by
the weather;

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.573
just watch the weather channel,
to hell with MSNBC and CNN and

00:37:53.573 --> 00:37:57.449
all those blabbering pundits,
just watch the weather channel.

00:37:57.449 --> 00:38:02.666
[Laughter]
He really believed that though,

00:38:02.666 --> 00:38:08.010
and there was some reason to
believe it.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.401
Now, the problem was,
Southerners wanted one thing

00:38:10.401 --> 00:38:12.841
out of this and a lot of
Northerners wanted another

00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:15.472
thing.
But here was the question,

00:38:15.472 --> 00:38:20.497
which principal will you apply
about slavery in the Kansas and

00:38:20.497 --> 00:38:25.849
Nebraska Territory?
Think now of the recent past;

00:38:25.849 --> 00:38:27.967
think of the distant past--in
American terms--to the

00:38:27.967 --> 00:38:28.840
Compromise of 1850.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.159
One, had the Compromise of 1850
already superseded the Missouri

00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:37.050
Compromise?
Think about that.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:40.997
You had that sacred bargain,
they said, of the 36º30'

00:38:40.997 --> 00:38:44.944
parallel line dividing free
territory from slave territory

00:38:44.944 --> 00:38:48.805
forever, passed back in 1820.
That was that vow that

00:38:48.805 --> 00:38:52.888
Northerners concerned about the
expansion of slavery could

00:38:52.888 --> 00:38:56.398
always assume the great
northwest would be free of

00:38:56.398 --> 00:39:00.577
slavery.
But half of California is below

00:39:00.577 --> 00:39:03.720
it and half of it's above it.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:10.193
Had the Compromise of 1850--and
half the Mexican Session is

00:39:10.193 --> 00:39:13.102
above it, and now you've said
popular sovereignty will

00:39:13.102 --> 00:39:16.670
determine the Utah Territory and
not the Missouri Compromise.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:18.790
So which rule is in play?

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.520
Which principle do you apply?
Do you apply the oldest

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.340
principle of the Northwest
Ordinance from 1787?

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.162
The Northwest Ordinance,
folks, had said slavery shall

00:39:34.162 --> 00:39:37.119
never exist in the Northwest
Territory;

00:39:37.119 --> 00:39:40.232
which became those five states
of Michigan, Ohio,

00:39:40.232 --> 00:39:43.021
Indiana, Illinois,
and Wisconsin--will never

00:39:43.021 --> 00:39:45.341
exist.
Explicit territorial

00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:49.099
exclusion--that's one principle.
The second principle,

00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:51.097
geographical division,
Missouri Compromise,

00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:52.810
draw a line across the
continent.

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:56.990
Do you go back to that one?
Or do you use the third one now?

00:40:00.039 --> 00:40:02.539
The third one that's in
play--popular sovereignty--just

00:40:02.539 --> 00:40:05.558
let the people choose.
Forget geography,

00:40:05.558 --> 00:40:10.050
forget old laws,
and have a referendum.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:19.261
In other words--and this is the
great question of the 1850s and

00:40:19.261 --> 00:40:21.867
the terrible tragedy,
that, in the end,

00:40:21.867 --> 00:40:24.935
nothing worked.
Would the American pragmatic

00:40:24.935 --> 00:40:27.771
tradition now--yes,
we've got this-- we've got

00:40:27.771 --> 00:40:30.875
principle A, B and C here.
We all want principled

00:40:30.875 --> 00:40:33.531
politicians don't we?
We want principled professors

00:40:33.531 --> 00:40:36.199
and principled politicians and
principled stockbrokers.

00:40:36.199 --> 00:40:38.828
But, at the end of the day,
sometimes there are three

00:40:38.828 --> 00:40:39.890
principles in play.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.860
Would American pragmatism
continue to solve this one?

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:50.676
Well maybe that principle is
best now, but that principle is

00:40:50.676 --> 00:40:54.705
better then.
Douglas wrote the bill,

00:40:54.705 --> 00:40:59.975
the Kansas-Nebraska Bill,
as it was called,

00:40:59.975 --> 00:41:07.512
or Act.
Now, in this case,

00:41:07.512 --> 00:41:17.670
folks, numbers matter.
We're going to look at a vote.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:20.602
But first of all,
he wrote three different

00:41:20.602 --> 00:41:25.037
versions of the Kansas-Nebraska
Act--this is important--he went

00:41:25.037 --> 00:41:29.697
from vaguest to most specific,
because Southerners put his

00:41:29.697 --> 00:41:32.750
feet to the fire and made him do
it.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:36.694
He first introduced a bill in
December 1853--this is for the

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:39.969
establishment of Kansas and
Nebraska Territory.

00:41:39.969 --> 00:41:42.839
Everybody said,
"that's nice for establishing

00:41:42.839 --> 00:41:45.447
these millions of acres and
square miles,

00:41:45.447 --> 00:41:49.841
but is slavery going to exist?"
The first version that he put

00:41:49.841 --> 00:41:53.992
before Congress on January
4,1854, said that a state shall

00:41:53.992 --> 00:41:56.760
be admitted from those
territories,

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.615
quote, "with or without slavery
as their Constitution may

00:42:01.615 --> 00:42:04.910
prescribe at the time of
admission."

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:10.998
Note the vagueness.
And you all know that in

00:42:10.998 --> 00:42:16.110
politics sometimes the vaguer
you are, the more you get done.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:19.783
"With or without slavery as
their Constitution may prescribe

00:42:19.783 --> 00:42:25.604
at the time of their admission."
How that's to be done was not

00:42:25.604 --> 00:42:30.260
mentioned.
Douglas said leave it to time,

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:34.982
climate, and good sense.
It was silent about the old

00:42:34.982 --> 00:42:36.920
Missouri Compromise Line.

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:43.423
Southerners quickly reacted and
said, "Stephen"--his own fellow

00:42:43.423 --> 00:42:46.776
Democrats in the south who were
now dominant in the South said,

00:42:46.776 --> 00:42:49.173
"nope, not enough."
And there were a lot of

00:42:49.173 --> 00:42:50.980
powerful Southerners in the
Senate.

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:55.657
So he drafted six days later,
January 10 of '54,

00:42:55.657 --> 00:42:59.937
a second version of the
Kansas-Nebraska Act,

00:42:59.937 --> 00:43:05.710
and he gave a direct statement
of popular sovereignty.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:11.837
Quote: "The decision on slavery
shall be left to the people

00:43:11.837 --> 00:43:15.961
residing therein."
Now he's moved one step further

00:43:15.961 --> 00:43:18.880
and said there's going to be a
vote out there,

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.670
and however they vote that'll
determine.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:28.039
Again, his fellow Southerners
said, "No, not enough."

00:43:28.039 --> 00:43:33.413
And there's a famous episode
where as a kind of spokesman for

00:43:33.413 --> 00:43:37.541
the Southern point-of-view,
a Kentucky Whig from the other

00:43:37.541 --> 00:43:40.758
party named Archibald Dixon took
Stephen Douglas for a ride in a

00:43:40.758 --> 00:43:41.780
carriage one day,

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.587
in March of 1854 after
these--excuse me,

00:43:47.587 --> 00:43:51.127
in late January--they were
going to vote on it later in

00:43:51.127 --> 00:43:58.119
March--but in late January,
took him for a carriage ride.

00:43:58.119 --> 00:44:00.667
And Dixon in no uncertain terms
told Douglas,

00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:04.140
"no, no, what you have to do is
you have to draft an explicit

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.630
repeal of the Missouri
Compromise Line,

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:11.856
a specific repeal of any
geographic division between

00:44:11.856 --> 00:44:16.996
slavery and freedom in the West.
In other words Stephen,

00:44:16.996 --> 00:44:21.319
you have to open up the entire
West to the possible expansion

00:44:21.319 --> 00:44:24.189
of slavery."
Douglas didn't want to do

00:44:24.189 --> 00:44:28.053
that--he knew this was going to
cause a bad time in the

00:44:28.053 --> 00:44:31.989
north--and he is alleged to have
said back to Dixon,

00:44:31.989 --> 00:44:35.539
quote, "By God,
sir, you are right.

00:44:35.539 --> 00:44:39.869
I will incorporate it in my
bill though I know it will raise

00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:45.590
a hell of a storm."
And he was right.

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:50.691
It may seem a bit odd to us
today that Americans could care

00:44:50.691 --> 00:44:55.090
this much about what was to be
done to Nebraska,

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:58.610
[laughter]
or for that matter with Kansas.

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:01.561
We didn't even know about
Dorothy yet, and the Yellow

00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:02.300
Brick Road.

00:45:06.489 --> 00:45:09.601
But Northerners really did
care, because think back again

00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:12.712
to this idea of free labor
ideology--and we'll bring this

00:45:12.712 --> 00:45:15.489
up again and again in the next
three lectures.

00:45:15.489 --> 00:45:20.229
The American Dream to the
average Northerner,

00:45:20.229 --> 00:45:24.429
immigrant or not,
was land--free land if

00:45:24.429 --> 00:45:28.123
possible,
cheap land if not--a place to

00:45:28.123 --> 00:45:32.789
move to, mobility where you
would never have to compete with

00:45:32.789 --> 00:45:37.060
any kind of oligarchy that could
control that land.

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:44.010
The bill that he finally
brought forth and that actually

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:47.360
passed had two measures.
And I'm going to leave you here.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:52.258
The two measures were the
explicit repeal of the Missouri

00:45:52.258 --> 00:45:56.020
Compromise Line and the
principle of popular

00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.492
sovereignty,
the formula for the settlement

00:46:00.492 --> 00:46:04.936
of Kansas and Nebraska.
The Kansas-Nebraska Act is,

00:46:04.936 --> 00:46:08.909
arguably, the pivotal event
politically of the 1850s,

00:46:08.909 --> 00:46:12.256
that will now sectionalize
American politics,

00:46:12.256 --> 00:46:16.742
break apart forever the Whig
Party--what was left of it--and

00:46:16.742 --> 00:46:20.925
give birth to the first
successful third party coalition

00:46:20.925 --> 00:46:25.260
movement in American
History--the Republican Party,

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:29.364
immediately--which comes into
existence immediately--in the

00:46:29.364 --> 00:46:33.369
wake of the Kansas-Nebraska Act.
And if you want to understand

00:46:33.369 --> 00:46:36.513
how sectional that vote was,
write down that vote count in

00:46:36.513 --> 00:46:39.747
the House.
Note, Northern Democrats split

00:46:39.747 --> 00:46:44.783
right in half--that's Douglas's
party--but nearly half of his

00:46:44.783 --> 00:46:48.980
own party in the House voted
against this bill.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:51.914
Southern Democrats,
57 to 2--I can't explain those

00:46:51.914 --> 00:46:54.429
two, I don't know what happened
to them.

00:46:54.429 --> 00:46:58.870
Northern Whigs,
45 to 0 against this.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:03.224
This is a polarization, folks.
We've heard a lot about that

00:47:03.224 --> 00:47:06.349
recently.
Southern Whigs, 12 to 7.

00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:10.486
The Whig Party is diminishing,
it's all but--it will be dead

00:47:10.486 --> 00:47:14.912
in the wake of Kansas-Nebraska.
And the four Free Soilers,

00:47:14.912 --> 00:47:18.649
elected in 1852,
on a platform that opposed the

00:47:18.649 --> 00:47:21.574
Fugitive Slave Act,
voted, of course,

00:47:21.574 --> 00:47:26.598
against Kansas-Nebraska.
That vote, 113 to 10,

00:47:26.598 --> 00:47:33.968
got the Kansas-Nebraska Act
passed but in the long run with

00:47:33.968 --> 00:47:38.000
terrible results.
It will break apart the

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.489
American political party system.
It will bring about for the

00:47:42.489 --> 00:47:47.013
first time a genuine
anti-slavery political coalition

00:47:47.013 --> 00:47:51.190
that will elect a president
within six years.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.590
See you on Thursday.

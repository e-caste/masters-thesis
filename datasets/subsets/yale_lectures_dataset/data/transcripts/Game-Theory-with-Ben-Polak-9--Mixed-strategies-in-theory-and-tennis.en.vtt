Professor Ben Polak: So
last time we saw this,

00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:11.372
we saw an example of a mixed
strategy which was to play 1/3,

00:00:11.372 --> 00:00:15.370
1/3, 1/3 in our rock,
paper, scissors game.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.233
Today, we're going to be
formal, we're going to define

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.988
mixed strategies and we're going
to talk about them,

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:26.062
and it's going to take a while.
So let's start with a formal

00:00:26.062 --> 00:00:32.540
definition: a mixed strategy
(and I'll develop notation as

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.617
I'm going along,
so let me call it

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:44.140
P_i,
i being the person who's

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:53.923
playing it) P_i is a
randomization over i's pure

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:58.096
strategies.
So in particular,

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:03.045
we're going to use the notation
P_i (si) to be the

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:08.246
probability that Player i plays
si given that he's mixing using

00:01:08.246 --> 00:01:16.726
P_i.
So P_i(si) is the

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:33.050
probability that P_i
assigns to the pure strategy si.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.430
Let's immediately refer that
back to our example.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.799
So for example,
if I'm playing 1/3,1/3,1/3 in

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.559
rock, paper, scissors then
P_i is 1/3,1/3,1/3 and

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:51.220
P_i of rock--so
P_i(R)--is a 1/3.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.701
So without belaboring it,
that's all I'm doing here,

00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:58.477
is developing some notation.
Let's immediately encounter two

00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:00.650
things you might have questions
about.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.447
So the first is,
that in principle

00:02:05.447 --> 00:02:11.846
P_i(si) could be zero.
Just because I'm playing a

00:02:11.846 --> 00:02:14.087
mixed strategy,
it doesn't mean I have to

00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:17.258
involve all of my strategies.
I could be playing a mixed

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:20.439
strategy on two of my strategies
and leave the other one with

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:23.016
zero probability.
So, for example,

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:25.859
again in rock,
paper, scissors,

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:30.030
we could think of the strategy
1/2,1/2,0.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.787
In this strategy I assign--I
play rock half the time,

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:39.910
I play paper half the time,
but I never play scissors.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.998
So everyone understand that?
And while we're here let's look

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:49.423
at the other extreme.
The probability assigned by my

00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:53.699
mixed strategy to a particular
si could be one.

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.290
It could be that I assign all
of the probability to a

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.375
particular strategy.
What would we call a mixed

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.566
strategy that assigns
probability 1 to one of the pure

00:03:03.566 --> 00:03:06.340
strategies?
What's a good name for that?

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.629
That's a "pure strategy."
So notice that we can think of

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.267
pure strategies as the special
case of a mixed strategy that

00:03:14.267 --> 00:03:17.720
assigns all the weight to a
particular pure strategy.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.185
So, for example,
if Pi(R) was 1,

00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:26.998
that's equivalent to saying
that I'm playing the pure

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:29.570
strategy rock,
i.e.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.819
a pure strategy.
So there's nothing here.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.645
I'm just being a little bit
nerdy about developing notation

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:40.680
and making sure that everything
is in place,

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.126
and just to point out again,
one consequence of this is

00:03:44.126 --> 00:03:47.572
we've now got our pure
strategies embedded in our mixed

00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:51.830
strategies.
When I've got a mixed strategy

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:58.320
I really am including in those
all of the pure strategies.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:14.264
So let's proceed.
I'm going to push that up a

00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:21.063
little high, sorry.
So now I want to think about

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:23.879
what are the payoffs that I get
from mixed strategies,

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.757
and again, I'm going to go a
little slowly because it's a

00:04:25.757 --> 00:04:27.500
little tricky at first and we'll
get used to this,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.182
don't panic,
we'll get used to this as we go

00:04:30.182 --> 00:04:33.426
on and as you see them in
homework assignments and in

00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:42.305
class.
So let's talk about the payoffs

00:04:42.305 --> 00:04:49.267
from a mixed strategy.
In particular,

00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:52.500
what we're going to worry about
are expected payoffs.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:59.017
So the expected payoff of the
mixed strategy P,

00:04:59.017 --> 00:05:05.393
let's be consistent and call it
P_i,

00:05:05.393 --> 00:05:11.769
the mixed strategy
P_i is what?

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:26.674
It's the weighted average--it's
a weighted average or a weighted

00:05:26.674 --> 00:05:40.396
mixture if you like--of the
expected payoffs of each of the

00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:48.833
pure strategies in the mix.
So this is a long way of saying

00:05:48.833 --> 00:05:50.720
something again which I think is
a little bit obvious,

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.462
but let me just say it again.
The way in which we figure out

00:05:53.462 --> 00:05:56.348
the expected payoff of a mixed
strategy is, we take the

00:05:56.348 --> 00:05:59.607
appropriately weighted average
of the expected payoffs I would

00:05:59.607 --> 00:06:02.600
get from the pure strategies
over which I'm mixing.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.521
So to make that less abstract
let's immediately look at an

00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:09.840
example.
So here's an example we'll come

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.405
back to several times,
but just once today,

00:06:13.405 --> 00:06:16.629
and this a game you've seen
before.

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:21.813
Here is the game Battle of the
Sexes, in which Player A can

00:06:21.813 --> 00:06:25.209
choose--Player I can choose A
and B,

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:30.595
and Player II can choose a and
b, and what I want to do is I

00:06:30.595 --> 00:06:35.980
want to figure out the payoff
from particular strategies.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:47.117
So suppose that P is being
played by Player I and P is

00:06:47.117 --> 00:06:52.899
let's say (1/5,4/5).
So what do I mean by that?

00:06:52.899 --> 00:07:01.107
I mean that Player I is
assigning 1/5 to playing A and

00:07:01.107 --> 00:07:05.501
4/5 to playing B.
And suppose that Q--so I am

00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:08.671
going to use P and Q because
it's convenient to do so rather

00:07:08.671 --> 00:07:11.519
than calling them P_1
and P_2.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:15.393
So suppose that Q is the
mixture that Player II is

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:19.346
choosing and she's choosing a
(½, ½),

00:07:19.346 --> 00:07:24.090
so she's putting a probability
1/2 on a and a probability 1/2

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.273
on b.
Just to notice I switched

00:07:26.273 --> 00:07:29.319
notation on you a little bit,
for this example to keep life

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:32.615
easy,
I'm going to use P to be row's

00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:36.449
mixtures and Q to be column's
mixtures.

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:42.184
And the question I want to
answer is what is the expected

00:07:42.184 --> 00:07:52.560
payoff in this case of P?
What is P's expected payoff?

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.810
The way I'm going to do that
is, I'm first of all going to

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:01.358
ask what is the expected payoff
of each of the pure strategies

00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:06.460
that P involves,
the pure strategies involved in

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:10.566
P.
So to start off--so the first

00:08:10.566 --> 00:08:18.857
step is ask what is the expected
payoff for Player I of playing A

00:08:18.857 --> 00:08:26.111
against Q and what is the
expected payoff for Player I of

00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:31.157
playing B against Q?
That will be our first question

00:08:31.157 --> 00:08:34.190
and we'll come back and
construct the payoff for P.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.909
So these are things we can do I
think.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.200
So the expected payoff of A
against Q is what?

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.656
Well, half the time if you play
A you're going to find your

00:08:45.656 --> 00:08:49.349
opponent is playing a,
in which case you'll get 2,

00:08:49.349 --> 00:08:53.529
and half the time when you play
A you'll find your opponent is

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:56.270
playing b in which case you'll
get 0.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:02.319
So let's just write that up.
So I'm going to get 2 with

00:09:02.319 --> 00:09:10.350
probability 1/2 plus 0 with
probability 1/2.

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:15.440
Everyone happy with that?
That gives me 1.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.658
Please correct my math in this.
It's very easy at the board to

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:21.340
make mistakes,
but I think that one is right.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.526
Conversely, what if I played B?
What's the expected payoff for

00:09:25.526 --> 00:09:30.259
the row player of playing B
against Q, where Q is 1/2,1/2?

00:09:30.259 --> 00:09:36.186
So half the time when I play B,
I'll meet a Player II playing a

00:09:36.186 --> 00:09:42.303
and I'll get 0 and half the time
I'll find Player II is playing b

00:09:42.303 --> 00:09:45.710
and I'll get 1.
So let's write that up.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:59.467
So I'll get 0 half the time and
I'll get 1 half the time for an

00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:04.230
average of 1/2.
That's the first thing I ask.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.596
And now to finish the job,
I now want to figure out what

00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:13.279
is the expected payoff for
Player I of using P against Q?

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:16.820
That was the question I really
wanted to start off with.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.289
What's the way to think about
this?

00:10:18.289 --> 00:10:22.883
Well P is 1/5 of the
time--according to P,

00:10:22.883 --> 00:10:29.156
1/5 of the time Player I is
playing A and 4/5 of the time

00:10:29.156 --> 00:10:33.750
Player I is playing B,
is that right?

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.062
So to work out the expected
payoff what we're going to do is

00:10:38.062 --> 00:10:40.840
we're going to take 1/5 of the
time,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:45.253
and at which case he's playing
A and he'll get the expected

00:10:45.253 --> 00:10:49.210
payoff he would have got from
playing A against Q,

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:56.971
and 4/5 of the time he's going
to be playing B in which case

00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:04.470
he'll get the expected payoff
from playing B against Q.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.838
Now just plugging in some
numbers to that from above,

00:11:07.838 --> 00:11:11.595
so we've got 1/5 of the time
he's doing the expected payoff

00:11:11.595 --> 00:11:15.870
from A against Q and that's this
number we worked out already.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:25.539
So this number here can come
down here, 1.

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:32.358
And 4/5 of the time he's
playing B against Q,

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:38.711
in which case his expected
payoff was 1/2,

00:11:38.711 --> 00:11:44.636
so this 1/2 comes in here.
Everyone okay so far,

00:11:44.636 --> 00:11:47.471
how I constructed it so far?
Is this podium in the way of

00:11:47.471 --> 00:11:52.460
you guys, are you okay?
Let me push it slightly.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:59.030
So the total here is what?
It's going to be 1/5 of 1 plus

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:03.813
4/5 of ½.
4/5 of 1/2 is 2/5,

00:12:03.813 --> 00:12:11.960
so I've got a total of 3/5.
So the total here is 3/5.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.850
Everyone understand how I did
that?

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:19.379
Now while it's here let's
notice something.

00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:23.902
When I played P,
some of the time I played A and

00:12:23.902 --> 00:12:28.389
some of the time I played B.
And when I ended up playing A,

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:30.902
I got A's expected payoff.
And when I played B,

00:12:30.902 --> 00:12:35.257
I got B's expected payoff.
So the number I ended up with

00:12:35.257 --> 00:12:41.574
3/5 must lie between the payoff
I would have got from A which is

00:12:41.574 --> 00:12:47.390
1, and the payoff I would have
got from B which is 1/2.

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:54.440
Is that right?
So 3/5 lies between 1/2 and 1.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.035
Everyone okay with that?
Now that's a simple but very

00:13:00.035 --> 00:13:03.990
general and very useful idea it
turns out.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:08.764
The idea here is that the
payoff I'm going to get must lie

00:13:08.764 --> 00:13:13.623
between the expected payoffs I
would have got from the pure

00:13:13.623 --> 00:13:15.629
strategies.
Let me say it again.

00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:20.506
In general, when I play a mixed
strategy the expected payoff I

00:13:20.506 --> 00:13:25.302
get, is a weighted average of
the expected payoffs of each of

00:13:25.302 --> 00:13:31.300
the pure strategies in the mix,
and weighted averages always

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:37.360
lie inside the payoffs that are
involved in the mix.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.870
So let me try and push that
simple idea a little harder.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:47.249
Suppose I was going to take the
average height in the

00:13:47.249 --> 00:13:50.450
class--average height in this
class.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.278
So let me just,
rather than use the class,

00:13:52.278 --> 00:13:53.840
let me just use some T.A.'s
here.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:59.700
So let me get these three
T.A.'s to stand up a second.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.934
Suppose I want to figure out
the average height of these

00:14:03.934 --> 00:14:06.188
three T.A.'s.
So stand up close together so I

00:14:06.188 --> 00:14:07.570
can at least see what's going on
here.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.758
So I think, from where I'm
standing, I've got that Ale is

00:14:10.758 --> 00:14:13.889
the tallest and Myrto is the
smallest, is that right?

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:18.084
So I don't know instantaneously
what this average would be,

00:14:18.084 --> 00:14:22.639
but I claim that any weighted
average of their three heights,

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:26.167
is going to give me a number
that's somewhere between the

00:14:26.167 --> 00:14:29.611
smallest height of the three,
which is Myrto's height,

00:14:29.611 --> 00:14:33.340
and the tallest height of the
three, which is Ale's height,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.800
is that right?
Is that correct?

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.191
So that's a pretty general idea.
Thanks guys I'll come back to

00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:41.582
you in a second.
Let's think about this

00:14:41.582 --> 00:14:43.746
somewhere else,
let's think about the batting

00:14:43.746 --> 00:14:46.599
average of a team.
The team batting average in

00:14:46.599 --> 00:14:49.700
baseball, let's use the Yankees,
for example.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.829
We know that the team batting
average, the average batting

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:55.629
average of the Yankee's--I don't
know what it is,

00:14:55.629 --> 00:14:58.504
I didn't look it up this
morning--but I know it lies

00:14:58.504 --> 00:15:02.056
somewhere between the player who
has the highest batting average

00:15:02.056 --> 00:15:04.549
which I'm guessing is Jeter,
I'm guessing,

00:15:04.549 --> 00:15:06.937
and the lowest,
the person on the team who has

00:15:06.937 --> 00:15:09.702
the lowest batting average,
who is probably one of the

00:15:09.702 --> 00:15:11.912
pitchers who played,
who batted a few times in one

00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:15.040
of those inter-league games.
(It would have been better if

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.561
I'd used the Mets but I feel I
should take pity on Mets fans

00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:22.500
this week and not mention them.)
So this is a very simple idea,

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.913
it's deceptively simple.
It says averages,

00:15:24.913 --> 00:15:27.854
weighted averages,
lie between the highest thing

00:15:27.854 --> 00:15:31.483
over which you're averaging and
the lowest thing over which

00:15:31.483 --> 00:15:35.399
you're averaging.
Everyone okay with that idea?

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:39.359
Now this very simple idea is
going to have an enormous

00:15:39.359 --> 00:15:43.170
consequence, and here's the
enormous consequence.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:51.445
Simple idea, big consequence.
So there's going to be a lesson

00:15:51.445 --> 00:15:54.772
that follows from this
incredibly simple idea and this

00:15:54.772 --> 00:16:00.477
is the lesson.
If a mixed strategy is a best

00:16:00.477 --> 00:16:10.070
response, so if a mixed strategy
is the best thing you can be

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.591
doing,
then each of the pure

00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:23.540
strategies in the mix--I'm being
a little bit loose here but I

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:30.730
mean assigned positive
probability in the mix,

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:37.851
for those people who are nerdy
enough to worry about it--each

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:44.498
of the pure strategies in the
mix must themselves be best

00:16:44.498 --> 00:16:52.105
responses.
So, in particular,

00:16:52.105 --> 00:17:05.980
each must yield the same
expected payoff.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.657
So here's a big conclusion that
follows from that incredibly

00:17:09.657 --> 00:17:13.584
simple idea about averages lying
between the highest one and the

00:17:13.584 --> 00:17:16.900
lowest one.
Let's draw ourselves from that

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.319
lesson to this big conclusion.
What is the conclusion?

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:23.417
The conclusion is if a mixed
strategy is a best response,

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:26.569
if the best thing I can do is
to play a mixed strategy,

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:29.451
then each of the pure
strategies which I'm playing in

00:17:29.451 --> 00:17:32.776
that mix, which I'm assigning
positive probability to in that

00:17:32.776 --> 00:17:36.189
mix,
must themselves be best

00:17:36.189 --> 00:17:38.391
responses.
In particular,

00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:41.740
each of them therefore must
yield the same expected payoff.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:47.037
So let's go back to our example.
Can I steal my three T.A.'s

00:17:47.037 --> 00:17:48.629
again?
Suppose the game,

00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:50.638
suppose the thing I'm involved
in--I should have made this

00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:52.329
easier before,
let me come down a little bit.

00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:54.680
I'll stand above here,
this is good.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.547
So suppose the game I'm
involved in, the payoff in the

00:17:58.547 --> 00:18:02.998
game is, a game in which I have
to choose the tallest group of

00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:06.228
my T.A.'s.
So my payoff is going to be the

00:18:06.228 --> 00:18:10.432
average height of whichever
subgroup of my T.A.'s I pick and

00:18:10.432 --> 00:18:14.249
these are my three choices.
So if I pick more than one of

00:18:14.249 --> 00:18:17.434
them I'm going to get a weighted
average, that's a mixed

00:18:17.434 --> 00:18:21.039
strategy.
My aim here is to maximize the

00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:24.529
height of whatever subgroup I
pick.

00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:26.457
So in this game,
here's my three pure

00:18:26.457 --> 00:18:29.510
strategies: my three pure
strategies are to pick Myrto;

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:32.210
Ale;
or Jake.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.950
Those are my three pure
strategies.

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.099
And my mixture,
I could mix these two,

00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:38.829
I could mix these two,
I could mix all three.

00:18:38.829 --> 00:18:42.662
But remember my payoff here is
to get the group,

00:18:42.662 --> 00:18:48.959
the average as high as I can.
So how am I going to get the

00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:54.257
average as high as I can?
I get the average as high I as

00:18:54.257 --> 00:18:57.434
I can, I'm going to kick out
Myrto for a start because

00:18:57.434 --> 00:19:00.849
Myrto's just bringing down the
average, is that right?

00:19:00.849 --> 00:19:04.690
Average height I should say,
there's nothing--and actually I

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.009
think I'm going to kick out Jake
as well I think,

00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:11.670
I'm probably going to kick out
Jake as well because that way I

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.006
just have Ale.
So if it was the case that I

00:19:14.006 --> 00:19:16.662
was picking both of them,
it would have to be they were

00:19:16.662 --> 00:19:19.170
equally tall but since they're
not equally tall,

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:23.131
I should just pick the best one.
Let's go back to my Yankee's

00:19:23.131 --> 00:19:26.200
example, if I want to pick a
sub-team of the Yankee's,

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.234
I'm allowed to pick any number
of people, to have the highest

00:19:29.234 --> 00:19:32.049
average, batting average,
in that sub-team.

00:19:32.049 --> 00:19:36.089
The way to do it is to find the
Yankee who has the highest

00:19:36.089 --> 00:19:38.640
batting average and just pick
him.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.132
Let's do one more example.
Let me use the front row of

00:19:42.132 --> 00:19:44.214
students here,
so here's my,

00:19:44.214 --> 00:19:48.610
can I get this front of
students to stand up a second?

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:54.184
This is a part of the row.
And suppose my aim in life is

00:19:54.184 --> 00:19:58.329
to construct the highest average
GPA.

00:19:58.329 --> 00:20:00.932
I'm not going to embarrass
these guys and ask them what

00:20:00.932 --> 00:20:03.826
their GPA's are.
So my aim in life here is to

00:20:03.826 --> 00:20:07.010
pick some sub-group of these
one, two, three,

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.188
four,
five, six, seven,

00:20:09.188 --> 00:20:13.233
eight students,
such that the average GPA of

00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:17.560
that sub-group is as high as I
can make it.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.557
So what will I do here?
So this being Yale I'll just

00:20:21.557 --> 00:20:26.630
find the people who have the 4.0
GPA's and just pick them.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.330
Is that right?
You might think well why not

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.260
include somebody who has a 3.9
GPA?

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:33.640
That's pretty good.
So why not?

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.325
Because if there's anybody in
this group who has a 4.0 GPA,

00:20:37.325 --> 00:20:39.930
I'd do better just to pick that
person.

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:43.579
The 3.9 person would just be
pulling down the average.

00:20:43.579 --> 00:20:47.884
Now suppose there's nobody with
a 4.0 GPA and suppose it's the

00:20:47.884 --> 00:20:52.119
case that three of these people,
let's say these three people

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:55.517
have a 3.9 GPA.
So these three have 3.9 GPA,

00:20:55.517 --> 00:20:58.677
imagine that,
and these other people they've

00:20:58.677 --> 00:21:01.690
got horrible grades like B+
somewhere.

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.511
These are our future law school
students and these are the

00:21:04.511 --> 00:21:07.381
people--who knows what they're
going to end up doing--being

00:21:07.381 --> 00:21:10.393
President probably.
So to construct the group with

00:21:10.393 --> 00:21:13.390
the highest average GPA,
what am I going to do?

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:16.421
Well first I'll throw out all
these guys with low GPA's,

00:21:16.421 --> 00:21:19.562
so they can all sit down and
I'll look at these last three

00:21:19.562 --> 00:21:23.226
and these last three,
if they're all in the group

00:21:23.226 --> 00:21:26.190
they better all have the same
GPA.

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:29.154
Why on earth?
If I'm trying to maximize the

00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:32.868
average of my group,
if any of them had a lower GPA

00:21:32.868 --> 00:21:36.196
I should kick them out,
and if one of them has a higher

00:21:36.196 --> 00:21:38.404
GPA than the other two,
I should kick out both the

00:21:38.404 --> 00:21:40.327
other two.
So if I'm including all three

00:21:40.327 --> 00:21:43.001
of them, in my constructing of
the average all of them must

00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:45.554
have the same GPA,
which I'm going to assume is

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:48.440
3.9, to assume you can still
make into law school.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.660
Everyone understand that?
Yeah?

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:57.152
Okay, thanks guys.
So that's the way I want to

00:21:57.152 --> 00:22:01.032
think about this.
So the idea here is if I'm

00:22:01.032 --> 00:22:06.553
using a mixed strategy as a best
response, it must be the case

00:22:06.553 --> 00:22:11.440
that everything on which I'm
mixing is itself best.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.477
And the reason is,
if it wasn't,

00:22:14.477 --> 00:22:20.650
kick out the thing that isn't
best and my average will go up.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.844
So that leads us to the next
idea, but before I do just for

00:22:24.844 --> 00:22:27.519
formality, let me add a
definition.

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:33.770
The definition is this,
a mixed strategy profile--what

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:40.610
I'm going to do now is I'm going
to define Nash Equilibrium

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.941
again,
just so we have it in our notes

00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:44.855
somewhere.
So a mixed strategy

00:22:44.855 --> 00:22:49.450
profile--there should be a
hyphen there--(P_1*,

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:56.021
P_2*,
…all the way up to

00:22:56.021 --> 00:23:02.592
P_N*),
is a mixed strategy Nash

00:23:02.592 --> 00:23:12.284
Equilibrium if for each Player
i--so for each Player i--that

00:23:12.284 --> 00:23:20.005
player's mixed strategy
P_i* is a best

00:23:20.005 --> 00:23:29.040
response for Player i to the
strategies everyone else is

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:37.814
picking P _-i*.
So I'm exploiting,

00:23:37.814 --> 00:23:47.390
by now, a well developed
notation for player strategies.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.547
So this definition of Nash
Equilibrium, it's exactly the

00:23:50.547 --> 00:23:54.106
same as the definition of Nash
Equilibrium we've been using now

00:23:54.106 --> 00:23:57.466
for several weeks,
except everywhere where before

00:23:57.466 --> 00:24:00.123
we saw a pure strategy,
which was an S,

00:24:00.123 --> 00:24:03.995
I have replaced it with a P.
So the same definition except

00:24:03.995 --> 00:24:07.230
I'm using mixed strategies
instead of pure strategies.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:11.869
But an implication of our
lesson is what?

00:24:11.869 --> 00:24:16.201
It's that if P_i* is
part of a Nash Equilibrium--so

00:24:16.201 --> 00:24:20.460
if Pi* is a best response to
what everyone else is doing,

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.366
P_-i* --,
then each of the pure

00:24:24.366 --> 00:24:29.542
strategies involved in
P_i* must itself be a

00:24:29.542 --> 00:24:35.321
best response.
So an implication of the lesson

00:24:35.321 --> 00:24:40.250
is, the lesson implies the
following.

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:45.600
If P_i* of a
particular strategy is positive,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.257
so in other words,
I'm using this strategy in my

00:24:50.257 --> 00:24:57.168
mix,
then that strategy is also a

00:24:57.168 --> 00:25:07.220
best response to what everyone
else is doing.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:15.026
Okay, so from a math point of
view this is the big idea of the

00:25:15.026 --> 00:25:18.243
day, this board.
If you're having trouble

00:25:18.243 --> 00:25:20.298
reading this at the back,
trust me I've written that up

00:25:20.298 --> 00:25:22.620
on the handout that will appear
magically on the computer,

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.967
at the end of class.
At the moment you're staring at

00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:28.430
this, it's all a bit new,
and as well as being new,

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.016
you're saying,
okay but so what,

00:25:32.016 --> 00:25:37.799
why do I care about this
seemingly mundane fact?

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:41.729
The reason we're going to turn
out to care about this seemingly

00:25:41.729 --> 00:25:46.122
mundane fact,
is that this fact is going to

00:25:46.122 --> 00:25:51.940
make it remarkably easy to find
Nash Equilibria.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.823
This fact, this lesson,
this idea that if I'm playing a

00:25:55.823 --> 00:25:58.339
pure strategy as part of the
mix,

00:25:58.339 --> 00:26:02.864
it must itself be a best
response, that's going to be the

00:26:02.864 --> 00:26:07.228
trick we're going to use in
finding mixed strategy Nash

00:26:07.228 --> 00:26:10.642
Equilibria.
The only way I can illustrate

00:26:10.642 --> 00:26:14.743
that to you is to do it,
so I'm going to spend the rest

00:26:14.743 --> 00:26:18.620
of today just doing that.
I'm going to look at a game and

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.710
we're going to go through this
game.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:23.881
We'll discuss it a little bit
because it's a fun game,

00:26:23.881 --> 00:26:27.172
and we're going to find the
mixed-strategy equilibria of

00:26:27.172 --> 00:26:29.970
this game.
Everyone know where we're going?

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:33.526
I want to make sure before I go
on, are people looking very sort

00:26:33.526 --> 00:26:37.267
of deer in the headlamps?
That was a lot of formality to

00:26:37.267 --> 00:26:40.150
get through in a short period of
time.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.460
Does anyone want to ask a
question at this point?

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.920
Are you okay?
Okay to go on?

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.652
So just remember that the
conclusion here comes from this

00:26:47.652 --> 00:26:49.630
very simple idea.
The simple idea is,

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:52.505
the payoff to a weighted
average must lie between the

00:26:52.505 --> 00:26:55.160
best and worst thing involved in
the average,

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.016
and therefore if I'm including
things in there as part of a

00:26:59.016 --> 00:27:01.609
best response,
they must all be good.

00:27:01.609 --> 00:27:04.796
That's the simple idea,
this is the dramatic

00:27:04.796 --> 00:27:06.998
conclusion.
So the only way to prove this

00:27:06.998 --> 00:27:09.730
to you and the only way to prove
to you that this is useful is to

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:14.070
go ahead and do it.
So what I'm going to do is I'm

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:20.872
going to clean these boards and
I'm going to start showing an

00:27:20.872 --> 00:27:22.972
example.
Again don't panic,

00:27:22.972 --> 00:27:25.575
I think a lot of people at this
part of the class have a

00:27:25.575 --> 00:27:28.066
tendency to panic,
because it's a new idea,

00:27:28.066 --> 00:27:30.309
it seems like a lot of math
around.

00:27:30.309 --> 00:27:33.109
None of it's very hard math,
it's all kind of arithmetic.

00:27:33.109 --> 00:27:38.710
It's just this idea of not
panicking.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:45.374
So the example I want to look
at is going to be from tennis,

00:27:45.374 --> 00:27:50.910
and I'm going to consider a
game within a game,

00:27:50.910 --> 00:28:01.327
played by two tennis players,
and let's call them Venus and

00:28:01.327 --> 00:28:05.591
Serena Williams.
So a couple of years ago we

00:28:05.591 --> 00:28:07.730
used to use Venus and Serena
Williams for this example,

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:10.498
and then for a while I worried,
that you wouldn't even remember

00:28:10.498 --> 00:28:12.150
who Venus and Serena Williams
were,

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.700
and so we picked any two random
Russians, but now we're back.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.880
Seems like we're back to
picking Venus and Serena.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.416
So the game within the game is
this, suppose that they're

00:28:25.416 --> 00:28:32.039
playing and Serena is at the net
and the ball is on Venus' court,

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:37.826
and Venus has reached the ball
and Venus has to decide whether

00:28:37.826 --> 00:28:43.423
to try to hit a passing shot
past Serena on Serena's left or

00:28:43.423 --> 00:28:47.240
on Serena's right.
Notice I'm going to exclude the

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.478
possibility of throwing up a lob
for now, just to make this

00:28:50.478 --> 00:28:53.535
manageable.
So basically the choice facing

00:28:53.535 --> 00:28:57.859
Venus is should she try to pass
Serena to Serena's left,

00:28:57.859 --> 00:29:02.382
which is Serena's backhand side
or to Serena's right,

00:29:02.382 --> 00:29:05.339
which is Serena's forehand
side.

00:29:05.339 --> 00:29:08.087
People are familiar enough with
tennis to understand what I'm

00:29:08.087 --> 00:29:09.791
talking about?
So we're going to assume this

00:29:09.791 --> 00:29:11.164
is Wimbledon,
otherwise no one would be at

00:29:11.164 --> 00:29:14.490
the net to start with I guess.
So this is at Wimbledon.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:19.599
Let's try and put up some
payoffs here.

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:20.680
So these are going to be the
payoffs.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.619
I think that this example is
originally due to Dixit,

00:29:25.619 --> 00:29:31.896
but it's not a big deal.
I think this example is due to

00:29:31.896 --> 00:29:36.199
Dixit and Skeath.
So here's some numbers and I'll

00:29:36.199 --> 00:29:44.374
explain the numbers in a minute.
So this is 50,50,

00:29:44.374 --> 00:29:54.609
80,20, 90,10 and 20,80.
So what are these numbers?

00:29:54.609 --> 00:29:58.460
So first of all let me just
explain what the strategies are,

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.376
so I'm assuming the row player
is Venus and the column player

00:30:02.376 --> 00:30:06.077
is Serena.
I'm assuming that if Venus

00:30:06.077 --> 00:30:11.437
chooses L that means she
attempts to pass Serena to

00:30:11.437 --> 00:30:15.019
Serena's left,
we'll orient things from

00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:18.613
Serena's point of view,
and if she hits right that

00:30:18.613 --> 00:30:22.940
means she's attempting to pass
Serena on Serena's right.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.897
If Serena chooses L that means
she cheats slightly towards her

00:30:26.897 --> 00:30:30.400
left: not cheats in the sense of
breaking the rules,

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:33.079
but cheats in terms of where
she's standing or leaning.

00:30:33.079 --> 00:30:36.035
And if she chooses right that
means she cheats slightly

00:30:36.035 --> 00:30:38.906
towards her right.
So this is cheating towards her

00:30:38.906 --> 00:30:41.772
backhand and this is cheating
towards her forehand,

00:30:41.772 --> 00:30:44.809
assuming she's right handed,
which she in fact is.

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:46.940
Okay, what do these numbers
mean?

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:49.140
So let's start with the easy
ones.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.947
So if Venus chooses left and
Serena chooses right,

00:30:54.947 --> 00:31:01.920
then Serena has guessed wrong.
Is that correct?

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.264
In which case Venus wins the
points 80% of the time and

00:31:07.264 --> 00:31:13.117
Serena wins it 20% of the time.
Conversely, if Venus chooses

00:31:13.117 --> 00:31:18.660
right and Serena chooses left,
then again, Serena has guessed

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:24.204
wrong and this time Venus wins
the points 90% of the time and

00:31:24.204 --> 00:31:28.269
Serena wins the points 10% of
the time.

00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:32.058
This should be a familiar idea
by now, but why is it the case

00:31:32.058 --> 00:31:34.900
these nineties and eighties are
not a 100%?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.690
Why is it the case that if
Serena guesses wrong Venus

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:41.160
doesn't win 100% of the time?
Anybody?

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.070
Perhaps we can get a show of
hands, get some mikes up.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.960
Why isn't it 100% here?
Somebody?

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.990
Patrick?
Wait for the mike.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.864
Student: Sometimes she
hits it out of bounds when she

00:31:50.864 --> 00:31:52.022
serves.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:31:52.022 --> 00:31:53.993
Right, this isn't even a serve,
this is a passing shot but the

00:31:53.993 --> 00:31:55.688
same is true.
So sometimes you're

00:31:55.688 --> 00:31:59.097
successfully going to hit it
past Serena but the ball is

00:31:59.097 --> 00:32:03.039
going to sail out.
So that happens 10% of the time

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:08.383
here and 20% of the time here.
Look at the other two boxes,

00:32:08.383 --> 00:32:13.789
if Venus hits to Serena's left
and Serena guesses left,

00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:17.448
then we're going to assume that
Serena's going to reach the ball

00:32:17.448 --> 00:32:20.451
and make a volley,
but her volley only manages to

00:32:20.451 --> 00:32:23.460
go in--go over the net and go
in--half the time,

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:27.073
so the payoffs are (50,50).
Half the time Venus wins the

00:32:27.073 --> 00:32:30.369
point and half the time Serena
wins the point.

00:32:30.369 --> 00:32:33.763
Conversely, if Venus hits the
ball to Serena's right and

00:32:33.763 --> 00:32:36.354
Serena guesses correctly and
chooses right,

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:39.786
then we're in this box.
Once again, Serena has guessed

00:32:39.786 --> 00:32:43.143
correctly and she's going to
successfully reach the volley

00:32:43.143 --> 00:32:45.970
and this time she gets it in 80%
of the time,

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:52.346
so Venus wins the point 20% of
the time and Serena wins it 80%

00:32:52.346 --> 00:32:55.696
of the time.
So just to finish up the

00:32:55.696 --> 00:33:00.413
description of the game here,
notice that we're assuming that

00:33:00.413 --> 00:33:05.051
Serena is a little better at
volleying to her right than she

00:33:05.051 --> 00:33:09.352
is volleying to her left.
So this is her forehand volley

00:33:09.352 --> 00:33:12.849
and we're going to assume that
that's stronger than her

00:33:12.849 --> 00:33:16.222
backhand volley.
Conversely, we're assuming that

00:33:16.222 --> 00:33:20.301
Venus' passing shot is a little
better when she shoots it to

00:33:20.301 --> 00:33:24.380
Serena's left than when she
shoots it to Serena's right.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.250
This is her cross court passing
shot and this is her down the

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:30.972
line passing shot.
So none of that fine detail

00:33:30.972 --> 00:33:33.624
matters a great deal,
but just if you're interested

00:33:33.624 --> 00:33:35.640
that's where the numbers come
from.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.319
I'm not claiming this is true
data by the way,

00:33:37.319 --> 00:33:39.938
I made up these numbers.
Actually I think Dixit made up

00:33:39.938 --> 00:33:42.519
these numbers,
I forget where I got them from.

00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:45.680
So okay, everyone understand
the game?

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.730
So now imagine,
either imagine you are Venus or

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:51.713
Serena, or imagine perhaps more
realistically,

00:33:51.713 --> 00:33:54.829
that you've become Venus or
Serena's coach.

00:33:54.829 --> 00:33:57.740
Do I have any members of the
tennis team here?

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:00.414
No.
Well imagine you've become

00:34:00.414 --> 00:34:03.782
their coach, so you take this
class and then you apply to

00:34:03.782 --> 00:34:06.490
replace their father as being
their coach.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:09.590
That's a tough assignment I
would think.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.804
So an obvious question is,
you're coaching Venus before

00:34:12.804 --> 00:34:16.018
Wimbledon, you know this
situation's going to arise and

00:34:16.018 --> 00:34:19.650
you might want to coach Venus on
what should she do here?

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:24.621
Should she try and pass Serena
down the line or she should try

00:34:24.621 --> 00:34:29.429
and hit the cross court volley,
cross court passing shot?

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:33.082
Notice that this is a question
of should you,

00:34:33.082 --> 00:34:38.062
Venus, play to your strength
which is the cross court passing

00:34:38.062 --> 00:34:42.665
shot,
or should you play to Serena's

00:34:42.665 --> 00:34:49.989
weakness, which would be to hit
it to Serena's backhand.

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:53.079
Playing to your strength is to
choose right and playing to

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:55.139
Serena's weakness is to choose
left.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:59.209
Conversely, for Serena,
should you lean towards your

00:34:59.209 --> 00:35:03.677
strength, which I guess is
leaning to the right or should

00:35:03.677 --> 00:35:06.630
you lean towards Venus'
weakness,

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:10.934
which I guess is leaning left?
When you look at coaching

00:35:10.934 --> 00:35:13.739
manuals on this stuff,
or you listen to the terrible

00:35:13.739 --> 00:35:16.985
guys who commentate on tennis
for ESPN--oh no I'm getting in

00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:20.119
trouble again--very nice guys
who commentate on tennis for

00:35:20.119 --> 00:35:22.974
ESPN,
they say just incredibly dumb

00:35:22.974 --> 00:35:25.781
things at this point.
They say things like,

00:35:25.781 --> 00:35:29.095
you should always play to your
strengths and don't worry about

00:35:29.095 --> 00:35:33.100
the other person's weakness.
I think it won't take much time

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:36.469
today to figure out that's not
great advice.

00:35:36.469 --> 00:35:39.739
But can people at least see
that this is a difficult

00:35:39.739 --> 00:35:43.008
problem, this is not an
immediately obvious problem,

00:35:43.008 --> 00:35:46.516
is that correct?
One reason it's not immediately

00:35:46.516 --> 00:35:50.179
obvious is not only is no
strategy dominated here,

00:35:50.179 --> 00:35:55.545
but there is no pure strategy
Nash Equilibrium in this game,

00:35:55.545 --> 00:35:59.703
in this little sub game.
There is no pure strategy Nash

00:35:59.703 --> 00:36:03.050
Equilibrium--and notice that I
added the qualifier now.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:05.297
Previously I would just have
said Nash Equilibrium,

00:36:05.297 --> 00:36:07.769
but now that we have mixed
strategies in the picture,

00:36:07.769 --> 00:36:10.717
I'm going to talk about pure
strategy Nash Equilibria to be

00:36:10.717 --> 00:36:13.360
those that are the only
involving pure strategies.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.020
Okay, so why is there no pure
strategy Nash Equilibrium?

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.093
Well let's have a look.
So if Venus--If Serena thought

00:36:20.093 --> 00:36:23.800
that Venus was going to choose
left then her best response,

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.455
not surprisingly,
is to lean left and if Serena

00:36:27.455 --> 00:36:31.190
thought that Venus was going to
choose right,

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:35.685
then her best response is to
cheat to the right,

00:36:35.685 --> 00:36:40.659
so 50 is bigger than 20,
and 80 is bigger than 10.

00:36:40.659 --> 00:36:44.387
And conversely,
if Venus thought that Serena

00:36:44.387 --> 00:36:49.762
was cheating a bit to the left
then her best response is to hit

00:36:49.762 --> 00:36:54.788
it to Serena's right,
and if Venus thought Serena was

00:36:54.788 --> 00:37:00.412
leaning to the right then Venus'
best response is to hit it to

00:37:00.412 --> 00:37:03.109
Serena's left.
So I think that's not at all

00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:05.489
surprising when you think about
it, not at all surprising,

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:07.916
you're going to get this little
cycle like this,

00:37:07.916 --> 00:37:10.858
but we can see immediately that
these best responses never

00:37:10.858 --> 00:37:23.296
coincide,
so there is no pure strategy

00:37:23.296 --> 00:37:30.556
equilibrium.
So that leaves us a bit stuck

00:37:30.556 --> 00:37:34.274
except I guess you know what the
next question's going to be,

00:37:34.274 --> 00:37:37.309
and I shouldn't leave it in too
much suspense.

00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:40.244
The next question's going to
be, okay there's not pure

00:37:40.244 --> 00:37:43.401
strategy Nash Equilibrium,
but we've just introduced a new

00:37:43.401 --> 00:37:46.656
idea which was what?
It was Nash Equilibrium in

00:37:46.656 --> 00:37:49.740
mixed strategies.
Maybe there's going to be a

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.739
mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.
In fact, there is,

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:57.036
there is going to be one.
So our exercise now is,

00:37:57.036 --> 00:38:02.884
let's find a mixed strategy
Nash Equilibrium,

00:38:02.884 --> 00:38:09.794
and before we find it,
let's just interpret what it's

00:38:09.794 --> 00:38:14.161
going to mean.
A mixed strategy Nash

00:38:14.161 --> 00:38:18.986
Equilibrium in this game,
is going to be a mix for Venus

00:38:18.986 --> 00:38:23.635
between hitting the ball to
Serena's left and Serena's

00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:27.176
right,
and a mix for Serena between

00:38:27.176 --> 00:38:32.789
leaning left and leaning right,
such that each person's mix,

00:38:32.789 --> 00:38:38.736
each person's randomization is
a best response to the other

00:38:38.736 --> 00:38:42.784
person's randomization.
Since these players are sisters

00:38:42.784 --> 00:38:44.940
and have played each other many,
many times,

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:47.199
not just in competition but
probably in practice,

00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:50.117
it seems like a reasonable idea
that they might have arrived in

00:38:50.117 --> 00:38:53.632
playing each other,
at a mixed strategy Nash

00:38:53.632 --> 00:38:58.178
Equilibrium.
That's what we're going to try

00:38:58.178 --> 00:39:02.590
and do, now how are we going to
do that?

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:07.099
So what we're going to do is
we're going to exploit the trick

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:09.880
that we have here,
the lesson here.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:14.760
The lesson we have here says if
players are playing a mixed

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.210
strategy as part of a Nash
Equilibrium,

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.487
each of the pure strategies
involved in the mix,

00:39:22.487 --> 00:39:28.220
each of their pure strategies
must itself be a best response.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:37.829
We're going to use that idea.
So let's try and do that.

00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:40.174
So I'm hoping that by doing
this, I'm going to illustrate to

00:39:40.174 --> 00:39:43.900
you immediately,
that this idea is actually

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:50.616
useful, at least useful if you
end up coaching the Williams

00:39:50.616 --> 00:39:53.244
sisters.
Alright, I want to keep this so

00:39:53.244 --> 00:39:55.120
you can still read it.
Ill bring it down a bit.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:40:01.682
Can people still read it?
Okay, so what I want to do is,

00:40:01.682 --> 00:40:06.674
I want to find a mixture for
Serena and a mixture for Venus

00:40:06.674 --> 00:40:10.213
that are equilibrium.
Having put it up there let me

00:40:10.213 --> 00:40:12.806
bring it down again.
This was not so intelligent of

00:40:12.806 --> 00:40:15.208
me.
I actually want to bring in

00:40:15.208 --> 00:40:17.407
some notation,
so as before,

00:40:17.407 --> 00:40:20.420
let's assume that Serena's mix
is,

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:27.401
let's use Q and (1-Q) to be
Serena's mix and let's use P and

00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:40.829
(1-P) to be Venus' mix.
Let's establish that notation.

00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:45.131
So here's the trick,
So this is the slightly magic

00:40:45.131 --> 00:40:48.117
bit of the class,
so pay attention,

00:40:48.117 --> 00:40:51.980
I'm about to pull a rabbit out
of a hat.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:41:03.077
Trick, what should I do first,
to find Serena's Nash

00:41:03.077 --> 00:41:10.039
Equilibrium mix,
so that's (Q,

00:41:10.039 --> 00:41:15.452
(1-Q)), what I'm going to do is
I'm going to look at

00:41:15.452 --> 00:41:21.790
Venus' payoffs.
So to find Serena's Nash

00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:31.425
Equilibrium mix the trick is to
look at Venus' payoffs,

00:41:31.425 --> 00:41:37.270
that's going to be my magic
trick.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:44.132
Let's try and see why.
So let's look at Venus'

00:41:44.132 --> 00:41:51.030
payoffs, Venus' payoffs against
Q.

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:56.119
So if Serena is choosing (Q,
1-Q), what are Venus' payoffs?

00:41:56.119 --> 00:42:05.374
So if she chooses left then her
payoff is 50 with probability

00:42:05.374 --> 00:42:11.544
Q--and I'm going to use the
pointer here,

00:42:11.544 --> 00:42:18.639
and hope that the camera can
see this too.

00:42:18.639 --> 00:42:33.857
She gets 50 with probability Q
and she gets 80 with probability

00:42:33.857 --> 00:42:43.127
1-Q.
If she chooses right then she

00:42:43.127 --> 00:42:59.527
gets 90 with probability Q and
she gets 20 with probability of

00:42:59.527 --> 00:43:10.970
1-Q.
I meant to point to that.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.237
So what?
So what is this:

00:43:14.237 --> 00:43:18.276
we're looking for a mixed
strategy Nash Equilibrium,

00:43:18.276 --> 00:43:22.409
so in particular,
not only Serena is mixing but

00:43:22.409 --> 00:43:27.860
in this case what we're claiming
is, Venus is mixing as well.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:34.871
So if Venus is mixing as well,
that means that Venus is using

00:43:34.871 --> 00:43:41.181
the strategy left with some
probability P and using the

00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:46.440
strategy right with some
probability 1-P.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:53.088
Since Venus sometimes chooses
left and sometimes chooses right

00:43:53.088 --> 00:43:59.090
as her best response to Q,
her best response to Serena,

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:05.940
what must be true of the payoff
to left and the payoff to right?

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:10.859
Let's go through it again,
so we're going to assume that

00:44:10.859 --> 00:44:13.720
Venus is mixing.
So sometimes she chooses left

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.004
and sometimes she chooses right
and she's going to be,

00:44:16.004 --> 00:44:18.246
she's in a Nash Equilibrium,
so she's choosing a best

00:44:18.246 --> 00:44:21.136
response.
So whatever that mix P,

00:44:21.136 --> 00:44:26.103
1-P is, it's a best response.
Since she's playing a best

00:44:26.103 --> 00:44:30.527
response of P and that sometimes
involves choosing left and

00:44:30.527 --> 00:44:33.350
sometimes involves choosing
right,

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:39.732
it must be the case that what?
It must be the case that both

00:44:39.732 --> 00:44:47.329
left itself and right itself are
both themselves best response.

00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:51.333
If she's mixing between them,
it must be that both choosing

00:44:51.333 --> 00:44:55.130
left or choosing right are
themselves best responses.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:57.620
If they weren't she should just
drop them out of the mix,

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.309
that would raise her average
payoff.

00:44:59.309 --> 00:45:04.570
Right, just like we dropped out
the short T.A.'s to get a high

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:09.658
height and we dropped out the
failing Yale students to get a

00:45:09.658 --> 00:45:19.799
high GPA.
So if Venus is mixing in this

00:45:19.799 --> 00:45:38.460
Nash Equilibrium then the payoff
to left and to right must be

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.862
equal,
they must both be best

00:45:42.862 --> 00:45:46.940
responses, both left and right
must be a best response,

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.805
so in particular,
the expected payoffs must be

00:45:50.805 --> 00:45:54.400
the same.
Is that right, is that correct?

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.929
So what does that allow me to
do?

00:45:56.929 --> 00:46:04.659
It allows me to put an equals
sign in here.

00:46:04.659 --> 00:46:07.351
Since left is a best response
and right is a best response,

00:46:07.351 --> 00:46:09.810
since they're both best
responses, they must yield the

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.362
same expected payoff.
Here's their expected payoffs,

00:46:12.362 --> 00:46:15.684
they must be the same.
Now, I've got one equation and

00:46:15.684 --> 00:46:18.840
one unknown, and now I'm down to
algebra.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.374
So let me do the algebra.
I claim this expression is

00:46:22.374 --> 00:46:26.573
equal to that expression,
so simplifying a bit I'm going

00:46:26.573 --> 00:46:31.000
to get--you should just watch to
make sure I don't get this

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:39.688
wrong--I'm going to get 40Q,
so this implies 40Q is equal to

00:46:39.688 --> 00:46:44.958
60(1-Q).
So I took this 50 onto this

00:46:44.958 --> 00:46:53.073
side and this 20 onto that side,
so I have 40Q is equal to 60(1-

00:46:53.073 --> 00:46:58.869
Q) and that implies that Q is
equal to .6.

00:46:58.869 --> 00:47:03.950
So those last two steps were
just algebra.

00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:08.114
So what was the trick here?
The trick was I found Q,

00:47:08.114 --> 00:47:15.500
which is how Serena is mixing
by looking at Venus' payoffs,

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:20.429
knowing that Venus is mixing
and hence I can set Venus'

00:47:20.429 --> 00:47:24.324
payoffs equal to one another.
Say that again,

00:47:24.324 --> 00:47:28.511
I found the way in which Serena
is mixing by knowing that if

00:47:28.511 --> 00:47:34.053
Venus is mixing,
her expected payoffs must be

00:47:34.053 --> 00:47:39.895
equal and I solved out for
Serena's mix,

00:47:39.895 --> 00:47:47.780
this is Serena's mix.
Let's do it again.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:49.719
Here I'm wishing I had another
board.

00:47:49.719 --> 00:47:55.119
I don't want to lose those
numbers entirely,

00:47:55.119 --> 00:48:00.520
so I'm going to try and squeeze
in a bit.

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:03.384
I know what I can do.
Let's get rid of this one

00:48:03.384 --> 00:48:08.949
entirely.
There we go, that works.

00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:11.810
Let's get rid of this one
entirely.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:17.130
I can still see my numbers.
Let's do the converse.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:22.079
Let's do the trick again,
this time what I'm going to do

00:48:22.079 --> 00:48:26.489
is I'm going to figure out how
Venus is mixing.

00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:31.284
I know how Serena is mixing
now, so now I'm going to work

00:48:31.284 --> 00:48:37.873
out how Venus is mixing.
Now, to figure out how Serena

00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:43.139
was mixing, I used Venus'
payoffs.

00:48:43.139 --> 00:48:46.840
So to find out how Venus is
mixing what am I going to do?

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.579
I'm going to use Serena's
payoffs.

00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:58.662
So to find Venus' mix,
which is P, 1-P,

00:48:58.662 --> 00:49:09.723
--let's be careful it's her
Nash Equilibrium mix--use

00:49:09.723 --> 00:49:18.073
Serena's payoffs.
Here we go, so if Serena

00:49:18.073 --> 00:49:27.296
chooses, this is S's payoffs,
if Serena chooses L then her

00:49:27.296 --> 00:49:32.694
payoffs will be what?
So again, just watch to make

00:49:32.694 --> 00:49:36.047
sure I don't get this wrong and
I'll point to the things to try

00:49:36.047 --> 00:49:43.031
and help myself a bit.
So with probability P she'll

00:49:43.031 --> 00:49:51.263
get 50.
So 50 with probability P,

00:49:51.263 --> 00:50:01.860
and with probability 1-P she'll
get 10.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:13.038
And if she chooses to lean to
the right, to lean towards her

00:50:13.038 --> 00:50:23.458
forehand, then with probability
P she'll get 20 and with

00:50:23.458 --> 00:50:34.178
probability 1-P she'll get 80.
We know that Serena is mixing,

00:50:34.178 --> 00:50:42.021
so since Serena is mixing what
must be true of these two

00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:44.528
payoffs?
What must be true of the two

00:50:44.528 --> 00:50:46.906
payoffs?
The payoff to l and the payoff

00:50:46.906 --> 00:50:50.852
to r, what must be true about
them since Serena is using a

00:50:50.852 --> 00:50:54.659
mixture of these two strategies
in Nash Equilibrium?

00:50:54.659 --> 00:50:58.972
It must be the case that both l
is a best response and r is a

00:50:58.972 --> 00:51:02.062
best response,
in which case the payoff must

00:51:02.062 --> 00:51:05.440
be, someone shout it out,
equal, thank you.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:10.780
They must be equal,
these must be equal.

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.809
They must be equal since Serena
is indifferent between choosing

00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:17.800
left or right and hence is
mixing over them.

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:21.130
So again, using the fact that
they're equal reduces this to

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:23.829
algebra, and again,
I'll probably get this wrong

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:30.191
but let me try.
So I claim, let's take 20 away

00:51:30.191 --> 00:51:37.219
from here, I've got 30P equals
70(1-P).

00:51:37.219 --> 00:51:39.199
I hope that's right,
that looks right.

00:51:39.199 --> 00:51:41.150
Again, this is just algebra at
this point.

00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:46.766
So I took 20 away from here and
10 away from there,

00:51:46.766 --> 00:51:50.809
and this implies that P equals
.7.

00:51:50.809 --> 00:51:56.150
So I claim I have now found the
mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.

00:51:56.150 --> 00:52:01.117
Here it is.
The Nash Equilibrium is as

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:05.088
follows.
Let's be careful,

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:13.210
this is Venus' mix.
So if Venus is mixing .7,

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:23.110
.3, .7 on left and .3 on right,
and Serena is mixing .6,

00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:32.289
.4, so this is Venus' mix and
this Serena's mix.

00:52:32.289 --> 00:52:41.106
Venus is shooting to the left
of Serena with probability of .7

00:52:41.106 --> 00:52:49.199
and Serena is leaning that way
with probability of .6.

00:52:49.199 --> 00:52:54.876
So we were able to find this
Nash Equilibrium by using the

00:52:54.876 --> 00:52:58.830
trick before.
Now let's just reinforce this a

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:04.250
little bit by talking about it.
So suppose it were the case

00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:10.972
that Serena, instead of leaning
to the left .6 of the time leant

00:53:10.972 --> 00:53:15.239
to the left more than .6 of the
time.

00:53:15.239 --> 00:53:22.457
So suppose you're Venus' coach,
and suppose you know that

00:53:22.457 --> 00:53:28.772
Serena leans to the left more
than .6 of the time,

00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:33.670
what would you advise Venus to
do?

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:36.531
Let me try it again.
So suppose your Venus' coach

00:53:36.531 --> 00:53:40.820
and suppose you've observed the
fact that Serena leans to the

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:47.318
left more than .6 of the time,
what would you advise Venus to

00:53:47.318 --> 00:53:50.239
do?
Pass to the right, shout out.

00:53:50.239 --> 00:53:50.650
Student: Pass to the
right.

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:51.983
Professor Ben Polak:
Pass to the right,

00:53:51.983 --> 00:53:55.107
exactly.
So if Serena cheats to the left

00:53:55.107 --> 00:53:59.941
more than .6 of the time,
then Venus' best response is

00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:04.742
always to shoot to the right.
That maximizes her chance of

00:54:04.742 --> 00:54:10.820
winning the point.
Conversely, if Serena leans to

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:20.740
the left less than .6 of the
time, then Venus should do what?

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:26.779
Shoot to the left all the time.
So if Serena doesn't choose

00:54:26.779 --> 00:54:31.162
exactly this mix,
then Venus' best response is

00:54:31.162 --> 00:54:34.799
actually a pure strategy.
Say it again,

00:54:34.799 --> 00:54:38.365
if Serena leans to the left too
often, more than .6,

00:54:38.365 --> 00:54:42.701
then Venus should just go right
and if Serena leans to the left

00:54:42.701 --> 00:54:46.102
too little,
then Venus should always go

00:54:46.102 --> 00:54:48.585
left.
We can do exactly the same the

00:54:48.585 --> 00:54:51.896
other way around.
If Venus shoots to the right,

00:54:51.896 --> 00:54:56.003
so that's her cross hand
passing shot more than .7 of the

00:54:56.003 --> 00:55:00.174
time,
and you're Serena's coach,

00:55:00.174 --> 00:55:05.000
what should you tell Serena to
do?

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.395
Go that way all the time.
So if Venus is hitting it to

00:55:10.395 --> 00:55:14.458
Serena's left more than .7 of
the time, Serena should just

00:55:14.458 --> 00:55:18.278
always go to her left,
and if Venus is hitting to the

00:55:18.278 --> 00:55:22.424
left less than .7 of the time,
so to the right more than .3 of

00:55:22.424 --> 00:55:26.886
the time,
then Serena should always go to

00:55:26.886 --> 00:55:29.645
the right.
So that's how this kind of

00:55:29.645 --> 00:55:33.140
comes back into the sort of the
coaching manuals if you like.

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:37.736
Okay, so how am I doing so far?
Have I lost everyone yet or are

00:55:37.736 --> 00:55:41.665
people still with me?
How many of you play tennis,

00:55:41.665 --> 00:55:45.126
ever?
So all your tennis is going to

00:55:45.126 --> 00:55:49.179
dramatically improve after
today, right?

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:51.600
So now let's make life more
interesting.

00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:55.078
Let's go back to the start.
We've figured out this is an

00:55:55.078 --> 00:55:57.510
equilibrium, this is how Venus
and Serena play,

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.613
Venus and Serena know each
other perfectly well,

00:55:59.613 --> 00:56:01.179
they know that they mix this
way,

00:56:01.179 --> 00:56:03.847
they're going to best respond
to it, this is going to be where

00:56:03.847 --> 00:56:06.403
they end up.
But in the meantime,

00:56:06.403 --> 00:56:12.429
Serena hires a new coach and
Serena's new coach is just very,

00:56:12.429 --> 00:56:17.163
very good at teaching Serena
how to play at the net,

00:56:17.163 --> 00:56:21.989
and in particular,
how to hit the backhand volley.

00:56:21.989 --> 00:56:25.359
So Serena's new coach,
let's say it's Tony Roche or

00:56:25.359 --> 00:56:29.537
somebody, it's just a brilliant
coach and Tony Roche is able to

00:56:29.537 --> 00:56:34.119
improve Serena's backhand volley
and that changes these payoffs.

00:56:34.119 --> 00:56:38.199
So you should rewrite the whole
matrix but I'm going to cheat.

00:56:38.199 --> 00:56:43.775
So the new game is exactly the
same as it was everywhere else,

00:56:43.775 --> 00:56:48.710
except for now when Serena gets
to the backhand volley,

00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:56.232
she gets in it 70% of the time.
So there used to 50,50 in that

00:56:56.232 --> 00:57:01.863
box and now it's 30,70.
So the game has changed because

00:57:01.863 --> 00:57:05.440
Serena has got better at hitting
backhand volleys.

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:13.699
We want to figure out how is
this going to affect play at

00:57:13.699 --> 00:57:17.203
Wimbledon?
Now it doesn't take much to

00:57:17.203 --> 00:57:21.119
check that there is still no
pure strategy Nash Equilibrium.

00:57:21.119 --> 00:57:24.463
It's still the case,
in fact even more so,

00:57:24.463 --> 00:57:29.355
that Serena's best response to
Venus choosing left is to lean

00:57:29.355 --> 00:57:33.490
to the left.
So it's still the case that the

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:39.150
best responses do not coincide,
there is still no pure strategy

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:41.942
equilibrium.
What we're going to do of

00:57:41.942 --> 00:57:45.242
course is we're going to find a
mixed strategy equilibrium,

00:57:45.242 --> 00:57:47.632
but before we do so,
let's think about this

00:57:47.632 --> 00:57:51.570
intuitively.
Let's see if we can intuit an

00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:53.778
answer.
I'm guessing we can't,

00:57:53.778 --> 00:57:56.429
but let's see if we can intuit
an answer.

00:57:56.429 --> 00:58:01.150
So Serena has improved her
backhand volley,

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:07.670
and hence when she reaches it
she gets it in more often.

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:10.140
So one effect,
you might think,

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.751
is what we might want to call a
direct effect and I think

00:58:14.751 --> 00:58:19.140
there's two effects here.
There are two effects,

00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:23.504
one of these I'm going to call
the direct effect,

00:58:23.504 --> 00:58:27.822
and by effect,
I mean in particular an effect

00:58:27.822 --> 00:58:31.150
on how Serena should play the
game.

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:35.547
So since Serena has improved
her backhand volley,

00:58:35.547 --> 00:58:40.769
when she reaches that volley
she gets it in more often,

00:58:40.769 --> 00:58:44.527
so one might say in that
case--your Serena's coach--in

00:58:44.527 --> 00:58:48.780
that case you should lean to the
left more often than you did

00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.835
before,
because at least when you get

00:58:50.835 --> 00:58:53.429
that backhand volley you're
going to get it in more often.

00:58:53.429 --> 00:59:03.373
So the direct effect says
Serena should lean left more,

00:59:03.373 --> 00:59:09.450
in other words,
Q should go up.

00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:11.485
Is that right?
So Serena's now better at

00:59:11.485 --> 00:59:15.092
playing this backhand volley,
so she may as well favor it a

00:59:15.092 --> 00:59:19.543
bit more and hence Q will go up.
So that's the direct effect,

00:59:19.543 --> 00:59:22.630
but of course there's a "but"
coming.

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:25.099
What's the but?
Again, let's see my tennis

00:59:25.099 --> 00:59:27.085
players here,
raise your hands if you play

00:59:27.085 --> 00:59:28.759
tennis.
Suddenly nobody plays tennis,

00:59:28.759 --> 00:59:31.260
come on raise your hands okay.
What's the but here?

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:37.666
We think Serena's backhand has
improved so she might be tempted

00:59:37.666 --> 00:59:42.316
to play towards her backhand a
bit more often,

00:59:42.316 --> 00:59:46.053
what's the but?
So I claim the but is this--you

00:59:46.053 --> 00:59:49.486
tell me if I'm wrong--the but is
that Venus (she's her sister

00:59:49.486 --> 00:59:52.676
after all,
right, so Venus knows that

00:59:52.676 --> 00:59:58.416
Serena's backhand has improved)
so Venus is going to hit it to

00:59:58.416 --> 01:00:02.180
Serena's left less often than
before.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.396
Is that right?
So since Serena's backhand has

01:00:05.396 --> 01:00:09.853
improved, Venus is going to hit
it to Serena's backhand less

01:00:09.853 --> 01:00:13.539
often than before,
and that might make Serena less

01:00:13.539 --> 01:00:17.398
inclined to cheat towards her
backhand because the ball is

01:00:17.398 --> 01:00:22.402
coming that way less often.
So this is a indirect or a

01:00:22.402 --> 01:00:29.377
strategic effect.
The strategic effect is Venus

01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:37.009
hits L less often,
so Serena should reduce the

01:00:37.009 --> 01:00:47.353
number of times that she leans
to the left because the ball is

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:55.233
coming that way fewer times.
Now notice that these two

01:00:55.233 --> 01:00:59.800
effects go in opposite
directions, is that right?

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:02.469
One of them tends to argue that
Q would go up,

01:01:02.469 --> 01:01:06.030
that's the direct effect and
the other one is more subtle,

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:09.719
it says we now think about not
just how my play has improved,

01:01:09.719 --> 01:01:13.592
but also how the other person's
going to respond to knowing that

01:01:13.592 --> 01:01:16.832
my play has improved,
that's the more subtle effect

01:01:16.832 --> 01:01:20.806
and that's going to push Q down.
That's going to make it less

01:01:20.806 --> 01:01:24.880
likely, that's an argument
against leaning to the left.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.899
So imagine you're going to be
Serena's coach,

01:01:26.899 --> 01:01:29.240
which of these effects do you
think is going to win,

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.443
let's have a poll.
Which of these effects do you

01:01:31.443 --> 01:01:33.543
think is going to win?
The direct effect or the

01:01:33.543 --> 01:01:35.245
indirect effect?
The direct effect or the

01:01:35.245 --> 01:01:38.199
strategic effect?
Who thinks the direct effect?

01:01:38.199 --> 01:01:40.763
Who thinks Serena,
who'd advise Serena to play to

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:43.327
her strength a bit more and lean
left a bit more,

01:01:43.327 --> 01:01:46.317
who thinks the direct effect?
Raise your hands,

01:01:46.317 --> 01:01:49.701
let's have a poll.
Who thinks the indirect effect,

01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:53.725
the effect of Serena hitting it
that way less often is going to

01:01:53.725 --> 01:01:55.596
win?
Who's abstaining and basically

01:01:55.596 --> 01:01:58.143
refusing to be a coach?
Quite a number of you,

01:01:58.143 --> 01:02:05.701
all right.
Well we're going to find out by

01:02:05.701 --> 01:02:13.880
re-solving for the Nash
Equilibrium.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:20.557
What we're going to do is redo
the calculation we did before

01:02:20.557 --> 01:02:24.882
starting with Serena.
So to find Serena's mix,

01:02:24.882 --> 01:02:27.465
to find Serena's new
equilibrium mix,

01:02:27.465 --> 01:02:30.303
what do we have to do?
The question is,

01:02:30.303 --> 01:02:33.239
in equilibrium,
is Serena going to lean to the

01:02:33.239 --> 01:02:37.022
left more (so Q is going go up)
or less (so Q's going to do

01:02:37.022 --> 01:02:39.347
down).
So I need to find out what is

01:02:39.347 --> 01:02:42.599
Serena's new equilibrium mix.
What's the new Q?

01:02:42.599 --> 01:02:44.993
How do I go about finding
Serena's equilibrium Q,

01:02:44.993 --> 01:02:50.320
what's the trick here?
Shout it out.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:59.422
Use Venus' payoffs.
So to find the new Q for

01:02:59.422 --> 01:03:11.610
Serena, use Venus' payoffs.
Now let's do that.

01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:18.167
So from Venus' point of view,
if she chooses left then her

01:03:18.167 --> 01:03:22.999
payoffs are now,
and again I should use the

01:03:22.999 --> 01:03:27.760
pointer,
30 with probability Q,

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.673
this is the new Q and 80 with
probability 1-Q,

01:03:34.673 --> 01:03:42.969
30 with probability Q plus 80
with probability 1-Q.

01:03:42.969 --> 01:03:46.205
Again, this is the new Q,
I should really give it,

01:03:46.205 --> 01:03:48.780
put Q prime or something but I
won't.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:55.519
If she chooses right then her
payoff is what?

01:03:55.519 --> 01:04:09.349
It's going to be 90 with
probability Q and 20 with

01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:16.361
probability 1-Q.
What do we know about these two

01:04:16.361 --> 01:04:19.039
payoffs if Venus is mixing in
equilibrium?

01:04:19.039 --> 01:04:21.386
We know she's mixing in
equilibrium because we saw there

01:04:21.386 --> 01:04:22.880
was no pure strategy
equilibrium,

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.238
so what we do know about these
two payoffs since Venus is using

01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:29.980
both these strategies in
equilibrium?

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.961
They must be the same.
Since she's using both these

01:04:31.961 --> 01:04:33.840
strategies, these strategies
must be equally good.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.788
They must both be best
responses so these two payoffs

01:04:38.788 --> 01:04:41.821
are equal.
Since they're equal all I have

01:04:41.821 --> 01:04:44.469
to do is solve out for Q,
so let's do it.

01:04:44.469 --> 01:04:57.227
So I'm going to get 90 minus 30
is 60Q, is equal to 80 minus 20

01:04:57.227 --> 01:05:04.429
which is 60(1-Q),
so Q equals .5.

01:05:04.429 --> 01:05:07.786
If I did the algebra too
quickly just trust me,

01:05:07.786 --> 01:05:10.998
I think I got it right.
From here on in,

01:05:10.998 --> 01:05:15.100
it was just algebra.
So what have I found out?

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:19.875
Did Q go up or go down?
Well it used to be,

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:22.691
Q used to be what?
.6 and now its .5,

01:05:22.691 --> 01:05:26.068
so let me ask what I think is
an easy question,

01:05:26.068 --> 01:05:30.980
did it go up or down?
It went down.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:37.789
Q went down,
the equilibrium Q went down.

01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:40.039
So which effect turned out to
be bigger?

01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:43.267
The direct effect of playing
more to your strength or the

01:05:43.267 --> 01:05:46.668
indirect effect of taking into
account that your opponent is

01:05:46.668 --> 01:05:49.320
going to play less often to your
strength.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.280
Which effect turned out to be
the bigger effect?

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.159
The indirect effect,
the strategic effect.

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:58.220
Of course I really did want the
strategic effect to be bigger

01:05:58.220 --> 01:06:02.077
because this is a course about
strategy, but the strategic

01:06:02.077 --> 01:06:07.351
effect actually won here.
The strategic effect,

01:06:07.351 --> 01:06:13.871
the indirect effect is bigger.
That's good news for me because

01:06:13.871 --> 01:06:17.080
it says the slightly dumb coach
who didn't bother to take Game

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.080
Theory would have stopped at
this direct effect and they'd

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:22.289
have told Serena to go the wrong
way,

01:06:22.289 --> 01:06:25.172
but the smart coach who takes
my class, and therefore somehow

01:06:25.172 --> 01:06:30.891
contributes to my salary,
in an extraordinarily indirect

01:06:30.891 --> 01:06:36.068
way, gets it right.
Now we can also solve out for

01:06:36.068 --> 01:06:39.449
Venus' new mix and we'll do it
in a second.

01:06:39.449 --> 01:06:43.149
But before I do it,
let me just point out that we

01:06:43.149 --> 01:06:47.079
actually, we really can now
intuit Venus' effect.

01:06:47.079 --> 01:06:49.360
It may not be exact numbers but
we can intuit here.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:52.817
As I claim, I claim if we think
this through carefully,

01:06:52.817 --> 01:06:56.210
we know whether Venus is
shooting more to the left,

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:59.190
than she was before,
or less to the left,

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:02.380
than she was before.
Notice that in the new

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.680
equilibrium Serena is going less
often to her left even though

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:09.500
she's better at hitting the
backhand,

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:12.090
she's better at hitting the
ball when she gets there.

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:17.235
So since Serena is leaning left
less often what must be true

01:07:17.235 --> 01:07:20.550
about Venus in this new
equilibrium?

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:23.616
It must be the case that Venus
is hitting the ball to the left

01:07:23.616 --> 01:07:25.289
less often.
Does that make sense?

01:07:25.289 --> 01:07:32.147
We have enough information
already on the board to tell us

01:07:32.147 --> 01:07:36.960
that, nevertheless,
let's do the math.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:51.559
Let's go and retrieve a board
to do the math.

01:07:51.559 --> 01:08:02.490
Just to complete this,
let's figure out exactly what

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:07.847
Venus does do.
So to figure out what Venus is

01:08:07.847 --> 01:08:11.020
going to do, what's our trick?
I want to figure out how Venus

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:14.303
is going to mix.
I'm going to find out Venus'

01:08:14.303 --> 01:08:19.250
new P, how do I find out Venus'
new equilibrium mix?

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:24.305
I look at Serena's payoffs.
So if Serena chooses left,

01:08:24.305 --> 01:08:27.592
her payoff is,
and I'll read it off quickly

01:08:27.592 --> 01:08:32.231
this time,
is 70P plus 10(1-P) and if

01:08:32.231 --> 01:08:40.311
Serena chooses right her payoff
is 20P plus 80(1-P) and I'm

01:08:40.311 --> 01:08:48.112
praying that the T.A.'s are
going to catch me if I make a

01:08:48.112 --> 01:08:53.545
mistake here,
and I know these have to be

01:08:53.545 --> 01:08:59.829
equal because I know that in
fact Venus is mixing--sorry,

01:08:59.829 --> 01:09:01.960
I know that Serena is mixing,
so I know these must be equal.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:12.366
So since they're equal I can
solve out and hope that I've got

01:09:12.366 --> 01:09:19.650
this right, so I've got 50P
equals 70(1-P),

01:09:19.650 --> 01:09:25.540
so P is equal to 7/12.
So again, that's just algebra,

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:27.290
I rushed it a bit,
it's just algebra.

01:09:27.290 --> 01:09:32.902
Same idea, just algebra.
So 7/12 is indeed smaller than

01:09:32.902 --> 01:09:38.994
what it used to be,
because it used to be 7/10,

01:09:38.994 --> 01:09:44.425
so that confirms our result.
So the strategic effect

01:09:44.425 --> 01:09:47.970
dominated.
Venus shot to Serena's backhand

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:52.289
less often, and as a
consequence, so much so,

01:09:52.289 --> 01:09:57.420
that Serena actually found it
worthwhile going more to the

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:01.326
right than she used to before.
Now let's just talk this

01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:04.162
through one more time.
This was a comparative statics

01:10:04.162 --> 01:10:06.252
exercise.
We looked at a game,

01:10:06.252 --> 01:10:09.491
we found an equilibrium,
we changed something

01:10:09.491 --> 01:10:13.381
fundamental about the game,
and we looked again to look at

01:10:13.381 --> 01:10:15.903
the new equilibrium,
that's called comparative

01:10:15.903 --> 01:10:18.020
statics.
Let's talk through the

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:23.476
intuition.
Before we made any changes

01:10:23.476 --> 01:10:29.634
Venus was indifferent.
She was indifferent between

01:10:29.634 --> 01:10:33.180
shooting to the left and
shooting to the right.

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:38.797
Then we improved Serena's
ability to hit the volley to her

01:10:38.797 --> 01:10:42.739
left, we improved her backhand
volley.

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:50.707
If we had not changed the way
Serena played then what would

01:10:50.707 --> 01:10:56.395
Venus have done?
So suppose in fact Serena's Q

01:10:56.395 --> 01:11:01.342
had not changed.
If Serena's Q had not changed,

01:11:01.342 --> 01:11:05.935
remembering that Venus was
indifferent before,

01:11:05.935 --> 01:11:10.120
how would Venus have changed
her play?

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.085
Somebody?
If we started from the old Q

01:11:13.085 --> 01:11:17.087
and then we improved Serena's
ability to play the backhand

01:11:17.087 --> 01:11:21.439
volley, and if Q didn't change,
what would Venus have done?

01:11:21.439 --> 01:11:24.405
She'd never,
ever have shot to the left

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:29.243
anymore, she'd only have shot to
the right which can't possibly

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:32.915
be an equilibrium.
So something about Serena's

01:11:32.915 --> 01:11:36.174
play has to bring Venus back
into equilibrium,

01:11:36.174 --> 01:11:40.810
it brings Venus back into being
indifferent, and what was it?

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:47.593
It was Serena moving to the
left less often and moving to

01:11:47.593 --> 01:11:51.429
the right more often.
To say it again,

01:11:51.429 --> 01:11:54.576
if we didn't change Q,
Venus would only go to the

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:59.009
right, so we need to reduce Q,
have Serena go to the right,

01:11:59.009 --> 01:12:02.090
to bring Venus back into
equilibrium.

01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:04.898
Conversely, if Venus hadn't
changed her behavior,

01:12:04.898 --> 01:12:08.409
if Venus had gone on shooting
exactly the same as she was,

01:12:08.409 --> 01:12:11.472
P and 1-P as before,
then Serena would have only

01:12:11.472 --> 01:12:14.859
gone to the left and that can't
be an equilibrium.

01:12:14.859 --> 01:12:17.512
So it must be something about
Venus' play that brings Serena

01:12:17.512 --> 01:12:19.310
back into equilibrium,
and what is it?

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:24.319
It's that Venus starts shooting
to the right more often.

01:12:24.319 --> 01:12:27.880
So just two reminders,
before you leave two reminders.

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.509
Wait, wait, wait.
First, in about five minutes

01:12:30.509 --> 01:12:34.580
time a handout will magically
appear on the website that goes

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:38.865
through these arguments again,
all of them in two other games,

01:12:38.865 --> 01:12:41.439
so you can have a look at the
handout.

01:12:41.439 --> 01:12:43.884
Second thing,
a problem set has already

01:12:43.884 --> 01:12:47.422
appeared by magic on that
website that gives you lots of

01:12:47.422 --> 01:12:50.966
examples like this to work on.
Play tennis over the weekend

01:12:50.966 --> 01:12:53.000
for practice and we'll see you
on Monday.

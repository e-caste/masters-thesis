00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.201
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay now,

00:00:03.201 --> 00:00:06.188
we didn't have sections this
week, in case you didn't notice,

00:00:06.188 --> 00:00:09.076
and therefore you didn't have
an opportunity to discuss the

00:00:09.076 --> 00:00:12.515
problem set during section.
So, I thought I would say a few

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:15.180
words about it now - here is the
problem set.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.360
You probably can't read it at
this typeface but that's okay.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.969
So, let's see,
problem zero is just a stupid

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.160
way of making you read the
policies.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.415
Never mind that.
Problem set one,

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:34.757
problem one:
here are exercises in one-digit

00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:39.210
scientific notation.
I don't have rules for this.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.380
As I mentioned last time,
the only rule is common sense.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.880
I think there might be some
difficulty with the last one.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.246
This business of taking things
to the one third power is

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:53.613
important because you keep
ending up with a cubed equals

00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:55.513
something,
and you have to figure out what

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:57.197
to do about that.
So, let me not do this

00:00:57.197 --> 00:00:59.547
particular problem,
let me do a different one for

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:02.827
you.
Supposing you had (6 x

00:01:02.827 --> 00:01:07.322
10^(4))^(1/3).
And you might be tempted to

00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:11.659
say, well okay,
that's 6^(1/3) times 10^(4/3).

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.935
And that leads you to a bad
place, because 10^(4/3) is not

00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.976
the notation we want.
We want this to be an integer

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:21.305
up there.
What does it mean to be a 1

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:24.860
with 4/3 of a zero after it?
And so, you don't like that.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.730
So, the way to deal with this
is to regroup.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:37.530
This is (60 x 10^(3))^(1/3).
That's 60^(1/3) x 10^(1).

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.607
What's 60^(1/3)?
Well, 4 times 4 times 4,

00:01:40.607 --> 00:01:43.811
as it happens,
is 64, and that's close enough

00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:50.790
for me.
So, this is 4 x 10^(1).

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.535
So, that's just an example of
how these kinds of things where

00:01:53.535 --> 00:01:55.319
you take things to fractional
powers,

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.483
either the square root,
which is to the 1/2,

00:01:58.483 --> 00:02:02.420
or the cube root to the 1/3.
All right, the next problem.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.791
Let's see, Neptune's moon
Nereid has an orbital period of

00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:10.464
almost exactly one Earth year.
If the mass of Neptune is

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:12.719
something or other,
what's its semi-major axis?

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.367
So, you have P and
M and you're asked for

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:18.069
A.
That's a completely

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.845
straightforward plug-and-chug
problem because there's an

00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:23.823
equation that relates these
three things and the only tricky

00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:26.851
thing about this is that you
have to make sure the units come

00:02:26.851 --> 00:02:30.242
out right.
All right, the next one looks

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:32.949
similar in form,
but it isn't.

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:36.190
Consider a Sun-like star
orbited by a planet with a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.057
period of eighty years.
So, we have P--the

00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:41.901
separation of the planet and the
star appears to be 20 arc

00:02:41.901 --> 00:02:43.365
seconds.
So we have an angle,

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:46.250
that's α.
How far away is the star?

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.637
And you want to know D.
Okay, there is no equation that

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:52.560
contains all three of those
things and so this,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.565
although it looks similar in
form, is actually a

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:58.060
substantially more difficult
problem.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.641
Going on, problem four.
Okay the important--in fact,

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.150
there is such a star,
blah, blah, does this fact make

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.370
any difference in the forgoing
calculation?

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.526
Explain.
The important thing to note

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:13.250
about this is that I'm not
asking you to do a calculation.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.060
This is not a calculation
problem;

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.218
this is a comment.
You're supposed to say

00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:20.040
something about how the
calculation would go if you were

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.015
to do it, but you don't have to
actually calculate anything

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:24.684
there.
And then, finally,

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:28.474
this last problem.
This is the sort of essay

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:32.150
question here.
The point here as I've written

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.530
down on the--there's about
Pluto.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.651
The point here as I've written
down on the actual paper

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:40.080
itself--there's no right answer
to this.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.332
This is a thought question.
There are some people I know

00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:47.060
from the course evaluations who
get disturbed by this because

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.469
they have the feeling that
science ought to have right

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:51.690
answers;
that is, after all, the point.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.833
And I keep asking these sort of
touchy-feely,

00:03:54.833 --> 00:04:00.849
humanities kinds of questions.
Revel in it, go with it.

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.000
And what we're looking for here
is the same thing as your

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.409
English teacher would be looking
for, right?

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.290
Although perhaps less emphasis
on writing style,

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.097
but, just have some thoughts,
do some reading,

00:04:14.097 --> 00:04:17.499
understand something and say
something intelligent and defend

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:18.879
it,
okay?

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:23.060
And a paragraph or two,
you know, two sentences

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.468
probably too little.
If it's more than two pages

00:04:26.468 --> 00:04:29.336
double-spaced or one page
single-spaced I'm going to get

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:32.518
really irritated because I have
to read these things and there

00:04:32.518 --> 00:04:38.279
are eighty of them,
and so don't go nuts.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:42.520
Again, just be sane about it
and say something intelligent.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.545
That's all we ask.
Questions about the problem set

00:04:46.545 --> 00:04:49.460
or about procedural aspects of
the course at this stage?

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.645
If you do have some at some
point, send them to us on the

00:04:57.645 --> 00:05:00.740
classes server.
Yeah, go ahead.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.485
Student: What would you
say is too short for the answer

00:05:03.485 --> 00:05:05.088
to that question?
Professor Charles

00:05:05.088 --> 00:05:07.259
Bailyn: Oh the answer--well,
a sentence is too short,

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.578
two sentences probably too
short unless they're pretty

00:05:09.578 --> 00:05:12.436
severe sentences.
I mean, it's got to be a

00:05:12.436 --> 00:05:15.741
paragraph, you know;
otherwise, you haven't really

00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:18.156
cleared your throat.
But I don't want to say

00:05:18.156 --> 00:05:21.245
anything too precise about that.
If you've got a really keen

00:05:21.245 --> 00:05:23.180
sentence, you know,
that might do the job.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.230
Again, sanity ought to prevail.
Yes.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.490
Student: Is the answer
to a question like that typical

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.517
of most of the problem sets?
Professor Charles

00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:33.850
Bailyn: We'll probably have
one of that nature.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.033
Not necessarily of this kind
about scientific controversies,

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:39.321
but about something.
Oh, and I should say,

00:05:39.321 --> 00:05:42.415
the way the tests will work out
is it's going to be probably

00:05:42.415 --> 00:05:45.141
slightly more than half
calculation and slightly less

00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:47.995
than half other things.
There won't be essays because

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:50.958
there probably isn't time to do
that on a fifty-minute test but

00:05:50.958 --> 00:05:53.730
there'll be short answer
questions and stuff like that.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.800
Yeah, we'll have these kinds of
discussion things.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.139
They won't be the dominant part
of the problem sets.

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.306
Just as in this case,
it's six points out of--this

00:06:03.306 --> 00:06:05.544
adds up to twenty points;
this one's six [points at

00:06:05.544 --> 00:06:06.960
problem set].
Other questions?

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.005
Okay, as I say,
if you've got some,

00:06:12.005 --> 00:06:12.790
let us know.

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.253
Okay, so as I pointed out last
time, we're talking about

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:30.970
"exoplanets" – planets around
other stars.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.379
And the problem with exoplanets
is you can't see them directly.

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:43.918
So, you can't see the
exoplanets directly as blobs of

00:06:43.918 --> 00:06:50.649
light in the sky and so what do
you do?

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:53.881
So, you have to detect them
obviously indirectly and

00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:57.620
here's--we've got to invoke
another one of Newton's laws.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.540
So, the key law here is now
Newton's Third Law.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.579
Newton's Second Law is F
= ma;

00:07:03.579 --> 00:07:06.490
you may recall that explains
all the Physics 180.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:13.502
Newton's Third Law is usually
phrased in textbooks and stuff

00:07:13.502 --> 00:07:20.040
as "every action has an equal
and opposite reaction."

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.983
I hate this formulation because
it leads to really bad

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:32.742
philosophy.
You know, this is one of the

00:07:32.742 --> 00:07:34.889
whole problems with physics in
general.

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:37.980
There are these words that seem
to mean something.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.699
Words like "force," words like
"potential," and these have

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:45.681
technical meanings in physics
that are actually different from

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:49.401
the intuitive meaning that you
have in your head just from

00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:52.916
using them in everyday life.
The big problem with

00:07:52.916 --> 00:07:56.933
introductory physics is getting
people to use these words as if

00:07:56.933 --> 00:08:01.016
they mean the physics definition
rather than as if they mean the

00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:03.939
everyday life definition.
And this leads,

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:07.860
as I say, in extreme cases,
to all sorts of bad philosophy.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.923
In fact, the two most misused
physics words that I know of

00:08:11.923 --> 00:08:15.202
are, first of all,
"relativity"--"Everything is

00:08:15.202 --> 00:08:18.390
relative," said Einstein.
Well, no, actually,

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.812
he said nothing of the kind.
And the other one is

00:08:21.812 --> 00:08:27.121
"uncertainty," which has to do
with quantum mechanics and these

00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:31.831
are technical terms in physics
and then they get sort of

00:08:31.831 --> 00:08:37.225
promoted to use in philosophy as
if they meant what they mean in

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:40.174
English.
So, I don't like this "every

00:08:40.174 --> 00:08:42.789
action has an equal and opposite
reaction."

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:45.977
You can get into all sorts of
bogus philosophy and I don't

00:08:45.977 --> 00:08:48.997
want to go there.
So, I would rather phrase this

00:08:48.997 --> 00:08:51.020
as "conservation of momentum."

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.769
And momentum,
as I say, is a technical term.

00:08:59.769 --> 00:09:06.061
It means M,
mass, times velocity,

00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:11.382
that's all it means.
And the kind of use that it's

00:09:11.382 --> 00:09:15.110
put to in electoral politics or
other things has nothing to do

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.598
with what's going on in physics.
Oh, I should say:

00:09:18.598 --> 00:09:23.200
velocity, one should be aware
of, consists of two things.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.394
It's not just the speed that
something has,

00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:26.700
but also its direction.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.351
And so direction counts.
So, if you turn around and go

00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:37.010
at the same speed you've
reversed your--you now have

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.929
negative velocity compared to
where you started with.

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:43.219
This, technically speaking,
makes this a vector quantity,

00:09:43.219 --> 00:09:47.617
but again, we won't go there.
Okay, so how does this work in

00:09:47.617 --> 00:09:51.415
the case of a planetary orbit?
So, here's a planet,

00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:54.708
it's on one side of its star,
it's going this way [draws an

00:09:54.708 --> 00:09:56.980
arrow up]
and it's got some momentum.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.456
And then half an orbit later,
it's over here going the other

00:10:00.456 --> 00:10:02.457
way.
Let's say it's orbiting some

00:10:02.457 --> 00:10:06.104
star in the middle and it's got
more or less the same speed but

00:10:06.104 --> 00:10:13.290
its direction is reversed.
So over half an orbit--so over

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:20.049
1/2 orbit, the momentum is
reversed.

00:10:20.049 --> 00:10:23.144
So, it goes from being positive
to negative, or something like

00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:25.250
that.
Now, Newton's Third Law says

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.361
that momentum is conserved.
The total momentum of the

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:32.970
system has to remain the same;
so something else has to change.

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.832
And here's the whole trick
about finding exoplanets,

00:10:36.832 --> 00:10:39.710
and that is that the star moves
too.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.871
So, when the planet's over here
at this blue arrow--the star is

00:10:44.871 --> 00:10:49.450
here, and it's also moving in
the opposite direction.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.131
And then half an orbit later,
the planet has come over to

00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:55.903
this side.
The star has moved in the

00:10:55.903 --> 00:10:59.940
opposite direction;
it's now going this way.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:04.040
And so the star moves too,
that's key.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:12.027
How much does the star move?
Well, the two momenta have to

00:11:12.027 --> 00:11:15.732
be equal and opposite.
This is what is equal and

00:11:15.732 --> 00:11:19.203
opposite about Newton's Third
Law is that these things have to

00:11:19.203 --> 00:11:22.653
cancel out.
So what you find is that the

00:11:22.653 --> 00:11:28.244
mass of the planet times the
velocity of the planet is equal

00:11:28.244 --> 00:11:33.740
to the mass of the star times
the velocity of the star.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.840
And because the mass of the
star is so much bigger,

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.629
so huge compared to the mass of
the planet,

00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:43.119
its velocity must be much,
much smaller in order for these

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:49.960
two things to be equal.
Okay.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:55.179
What are they orbiting around
then, if everything is moving

00:11:55.179 --> 00:12:01.505
together?
They orbit around the "center

00:12:01.505 --> 00:12:06.219
of mass," so-called.
This is just,

00:12:06.219 --> 00:12:10.008
you know, where the balance
point of a seesaw would kind of

00:12:10.008 --> 00:12:13.153
be.
And so here we have--here's the

00:12:13.153 --> 00:12:16.884
center of mass,
here's the star moving this

00:12:16.884 --> 00:12:22.480
way, way over here somewhere is
a planet moving much faster.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.396
And let's define two
quantities: this is the distance

00:12:26.396 --> 00:12:29.409
from the planet to the center of
mass.

00:12:29.409 --> 00:12:32.200
Here's the distance of the star
to the planet of mass.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.554
Star is moving at
V_star,

00:12:34.554 --> 00:12:37.309
planet is moving at
V_planet.

00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:42.457
And you can define a total
velocity, which is equal to

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:46.919
these two things added together.
And what does that mean?

00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:49.837
That's the velocity where if
you're on one of these objects,

00:12:49.837 --> 00:12:52.259
the other appears to be moving
relative to you.

00:12:52.259 --> 00:12:55.593
So, if I'm going this way and
you're going that way,

00:12:55.593 --> 00:12:58.860
we have a relative velocity
equal to the sum of our

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.498
individual velocities.
And there's also a total

00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:06.860
distance, which can be defined,
which is, by analogy,

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.946
the sum of the distance from
the planet to the center of

00:13:09.946 --> 00:13:12.360
mass, and the star to the center
of mass.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.629
And that's just the distance
between these two objects.

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:19.663
The distance and the velocity
in an elliptical orbit can

00:13:19.663 --> 00:13:21.870
change during the course of the
orbit.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.629
But for circular orbits or
close to circular orbits they

00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:28.719
remain about the same.
Orbits, you'll remember,

00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:32.339
are generally elliptical.
And a way of saying this is

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:36.742
that the maximum of the total
distance between these two is

00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:40.309
this quantity a,
the semi-major axis.

00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:43.883
Remember, the semi-major axis
is the long slice through the

00:13:43.883 --> 00:13:47.480
ellipse.
So, when this is at a maximum,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.759
that equals the semi-major
axis.

00:13:50.759 --> 00:13:54.504
For orbits that are nearly
circular you can sort of say in

00:13:54.504 --> 00:13:56.146
an offhand way,
well this,

00:13:56.146 --> 00:13:59.759
D_total,
doesn't change that much.

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:03.110
So, it's the distance between
the two objects.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.380
All right, now as I mentioned,
V_p

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.585
M_p is equal to
V_star

00:14:09.585 --> 00:14:13.677
M_star.
It is also true the way you

00:14:13.677 --> 00:14:17.759
figure out where the center of
mass is, D_p

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:21.148
M_p is equal to
D_star

00:14:21.148 --> 00:14:25.620
M_star.
And the whole point of this is

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:29.446
that this is a large quantity
compared to the mass of the

00:14:29.446 --> 00:14:33.555
planet,
and therefore these are small

00:14:33.555 --> 00:14:40.171
quantities compared to the
distances and velocities taken

00:14:40.171 --> 00:14:44.921
by the planet.
Small, but as it turns out,

00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:46.976
measurable.
In particular,

00:14:46.976 --> 00:14:50.560
the velocity is the thing--the
velocity of the star turns out

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.950
to be the thing that you can
measure.

00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:01.022
And so that's how you
find--determine that there's an

00:15:01.022 --> 00:15:04.800
exoplanet there.
What you do is you look for the

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.515
reflex motion of the star.
Planets going around the star,

00:15:08.515 --> 00:15:11.090
stars going around the center
of mass also.

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:15.879
And that is a motion that now,
these days, can be observed.

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:18.245
And you can see why this might
have happened only very

00:15:18.245 --> 00:15:20.610
recently, because that motion is
really very small.

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:23.672
Let me give you some masses
just to give you a sense of

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:26.271
this.
I've already written down that

00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:29.720
the Sun's mass is about 2 x
10^(30) kilograms.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.808
Just for reference,
the Earth's mass is 6 x 10^(24)

00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:41.409
kg, so down by almost a factor
of a million.

00:15:41.409 --> 00:15:44.840
And so the Sun moves much
slower than the Earth does,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.941
due to their mutual gravity.
Jupiter is the most massive of

00:15:49.941 --> 00:15:54.622
the planets, and it's at about 2
x 10^(27) kg,

00:15:54.622 --> 00:15:58.679
so 1,000 times smaller than the
Sun.

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:01.019
And so, of course,
the Sun moves 1,000 times less

00:16:01.019 --> 00:16:03.700
because of Jupiter than it does
because of the Earth.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.707
Now, of course,
the Sun actually responds to

00:16:05.707 --> 00:16:08.136
all of these planets,
so it's actually executing some

00:16:08.136 --> 00:16:11.301
complicated motion,
which is the sum of the motions

00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:13.983
induced by all the planets.
But in fact,

00:16:13.983 --> 00:16:17.752
Jupiter is significantly more
massive than the rest of the

00:16:17.752 --> 00:16:20.443
planets,
so by far the dominant motion

00:16:20.443 --> 00:16:24.710
that the Sun goes through has to
do with the orbit of Jupiter.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.069
And so the consequence of this,
because the masses are so much

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:30.768
smaller, is that the velocity of
the star is much,

00:16:30.768 --> 00:16:32.828
much less.
These two less-than signs

00:16:32.828 --> 00:16:34.889
[&lt;&lt;]
means much, much less than the

00:16:34.889 --> 00:16:39.183
velocity of the planet.
But it can nevertheless be

00:16:39.183 --> 00:16:40.320
detected.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:50.289
Okay, now, what do we expect to
see?

00:16:50.289 --> 00:16:52.847
Supposing you can now go out
and through means that we'll

00:16:52.847 --> 00:16:56.904
actually talk about on Thursday,
actually measure the velocities

00:16:56.904 --> 00:17:03.682
of stars in response to planets.
What do you expect to see in

00:17:03.682 --> 00:17:07.929
those--in other stars?
And basically,

00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:11.161
the answer to that is,
what you expect to see depends

00:17:11.161 --> 00:17:14.329
on what your expectations for
Solar Systems are.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:17.839
We've got one example,
or at least ten years ago,

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:21.609
we had only one example.
And so, you have to take what

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:25.156
you know about our own Solar
System and infer what other

00:17:25.156 --> 00:17:27.799
Solar Systems might want to look
like.

00:17:27.799 --> 00:17:31.147
And so, at this point I want to
show you some things about our

00:17:31.147 --> 00:17:33.672
own Solar System,
so a little slide show of the

00:17:33.672 --> 00:17:38.737
Solar System here.
All right, don't take notes,

00:17:38.737 --> 00:17:47.002
I'll tell you everything you
need to know after we finish the

00:17:47.002 --> 00:17:51.662
pretty pictures.
Okay, so starting from the

00:17:51.662 --> 00:17:54.490
innermost part of the Solar
System.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.269
This is the innermost planet,
this is the planet Mercury.

00:17:57.269 --> 00:18:00.809
Looks much like the Moon:
it's basically a rock with

00:18:00.809 --> 00:18:03.284
craters on it.
There was a time when we

00:18:03.284 --> 00:18:06.865
thought that its spin period was
exactly the same as its orbital

00:18:06.865 --> 00:18:09.309
period, so it keeps one face to
the Sun.

00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:11.852
There's all kinds of science
fiction based on that--that

00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:14.614
turns out not to be true.
But basically,

00:18:14.614 --> 00:18:20.131
it's kind of a hot rock,
that's all you need to know

00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:22.857
about Mercury.
Let's see, oh,

00:18:22.857 --> 00:18:26.278
here's a close up of a little
piece of Mercury surface,

00:18:26.278 --> 00:18:30.080
and you would have a tough time
telling that this was Mercury

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.819
rather than the Moon or many
other objects--rocky objects in

00:18:33.819 --> 00:18:36.369
the Solar System.
Next one out is Venus.

00:18:36.369 --> 00:18:39.546
Venus looks quite different
because it's got a very thick

00:18:39.546 --> 00:18:42.440
atmosphere, very thick carbon
dioxide atmosphere.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.950
This is all clouds that you're
looking at here.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.896
And, in fact,
the greenhouse effect,

00:18:46.896 --> 00:18:49.509
which is supposed to be
responsible, perhaps,

00:18:49.509 --> 00:18:51.984
for global warming,
was first studied and

00:18:51.984 --> 00:18:55.076
identified on Venus,
because it appears to have run

00:18:55.076 --> 00:18:57.428
amok on Venus.
The surface of Venus is

00:18:57.428 --> 00:19:00.819
extremely hot and it's covered
with these really thick clouds.

00:19:00.819 --> 00:19:02.665
So, it was quite hard,
for a long time,

00:19:02.665 --> 00:19:05.529
to get a handle on what was
going on down on the surface.

00:19:05.529 --> 00:19:08.170
This has now however been
accomplished.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.372
They've put things into orbit
that have radar,

00:19:11.372 --> 00:19:14.859
and can view the topography
through the clouds.

00:19:14.859 --> 00:19:18.390
They've also dropped things
onto the surface of Venus.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.874
The problem is at 700 degrees,
and it rains sulfur down there,

00:19:21.874 --> 00:19:24.730
so it's an unpleasant
environment for machinery.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.387
So things don't last very long.
But nevertheless,

00:19:27.387 --> 00:19:29.170
they've gotten some
information.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:33.802
Here's a little Venus landscape.
It's entirely artificially

00:19:33.802 --> 00:19:37.130
colored, right?
But the topography comes from

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:42.829
these radar mapping missions.
Here is a map of the whole of

00:19:42.829 --> 00:19:47.319
Venus made by these orbiting
missions.

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:51.402
And so Venus is important
primarily for its atmosphere,

00:19:51.402 --> 00:19:55.787
and as a kind of warning for
what might potentially one day

00:19:55.787 --> 00:19:58.660
happen here, if we're not
careful.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.930
Okay, this is the third rock
from the Sun.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.437
Ninety nine percent of all Yale
courses deal with what's going

00:20:05.437 --> 00:20:07.910
on on this little piece of
cosmic debris.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.854
I'm not going to say anymore
about it, therefore,

00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:14.105
oh, except for one thing:
it comes with this companion

00:20:14.105 --> 00:20:16.130
object.
This is the Moon.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.566
The Moon is a very special
thing because,

00:20:18.566 --> 00:20:20.759
relative to its planet,
it's huge.

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:23.117
This really shouldn't be
thought of as a planet and a

00:20:23.117 --> 00:20:24.839
moon, but rather as a double
planet.

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:29.730
Here they are to scale,
and that's much closer in size

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:35.359
than any other moon-planet
system around the major planets.

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:39.150
Moving outwards,
we come to Mars.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:43.001
This is about as good an image
of Mars as you can get from the

00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:46.599
Earth, and you can see why
people got excited about it.

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:49.930
These blotchy things here turn
out to change with time.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.978
And in fact,
they change with the Martian

00:20:51.978 --> 00:20:53.784
seasons.
So people got very excited,

00:20:53.784 --> 00:20:56.278
thought, "oh my goodness,
it's vegetation," you know,

00:20:56.278 --> 00:20:57.430
the seasons come,
go.

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.900
And there's a polar ice cap up
there, obviously.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.833
And 100 years ago,
people somehow convinced

00:21:03.833 --> 00:21:07.326
themselves that there were
canals and maybe cities,

00:21:07.326 --> 00:21:10.260
and maybe people all over this
planet.

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.690
This turns out to be wrong.
It isn't vegetation.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:15.769
It's actually dust storms--that
changes what you see.

00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:19.381
And by now we have some much
more close up views from things

00:21:19.381 --> 00:21:23.299
like the Viking Missions and a
number of more recent missions.

00:21:23.299 --> 00:21:27.269
And this is basically what the
surface of Mars looks like.

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:31.021
It has this slight reddish tint
overall, and it's a bunch of

00:21:31.021 --> 00:21:32.971
rocks.
It has an atmosphere,

00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:36.680
although it's less thick than
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.983
Now, one of the interesting
things about Mars is you can see

00:21:39.983 --> 00:21:44.963
features that look like this.
And this looks very much like

00:21:44.963 --> 00:21:47.949
river deltas.
You know, you see these little

00:21:47.949 --> 00:21:50.739
tributaries coming into a big
river, this kind of looks like

00:21:50.739 --> 00:21:52.490
Louisiana, or something like
that.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.449
And so, people are pretty much
convinced that there was once

00:21:56.449 --> 00:21:59.611
running water on Mars.
And that's important,

00:21:59.611 --> 00:22:04.119
because it is thought that the
existence of life as we know it

00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:07.740
is dependent on the existence of
liquid water.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.089
For a long time,
people thought that there was

00:22:11.089 --> 00:22:14.418
no liquid water.
Now, on Mars--it turns out that

00:22:14.418 --> 00:22:18.395
the particular temperature and
atmospheric pressure that exists

00:22:18.395 --> 00:22:21.859
on Mars means that water goes
from the solid state,

00:22:21.859 --> 00:22:26.172
from ice and sublimes,
directly into the gaseous

00:22:26.172 --> 00:22:30.210
state, much like carbon dioxide
does here.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.194
That's why it's called dry ice:
because carbon dioxide,

00:22:33.194 --> 00:22:35.682
when you freeze it,
and then warm it up again,

00:22:35.682 --> 00:22:39.070
turns directly into gas.
Water is supposed to do the

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.911
same on Mars,
but there was,

00:22:40.911 --> 00:22:43.707
just a month ago,
this interesting picture

00:22:43.707 --> 00:22:46.170
published.
This is from a satellite

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:49.289
orbiting Mars that's been taking
a lot of pictures.

00:22:49.289 --> 00:22:53.170
This is pictures of two
identical parts of the Martian

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:56.099
surface, one from 1999,
one from 2005.

00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:59.126
And the claim is that there's
new stuff down here,

00:22:59.126 --> 00:23:02.400
and that the way and the
pattern of that new stuff,

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.162
and the way it must have come
on, is from stuff flowing

00:23:05.162 --> 00:23:07.259
downhill, down the side of this
crater.

00:23:07.259 --> 00:23:09.758
And so now, people are
thinking, maybe there is

00:23:09.758 --> 00:23:12.853
something flowing around on
Mars, although clearly not all

00:23:12.853 --> 00:23:15.451
that much of it.
But that would be exciting if

00:23:15.451 --> 00:23:18.601
it was confirmed.
Okay, out beyond Mars is the

00:23:18.601 --> 00:23:21.838
asteroid belt,
filled with rocky chunks of

00:23:21.838 --> 00:23:26.339
stuff that look vaguely like
this--many, many of them.

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:28.529
There are asteroids all over
the Solar System.

00:23:28.529 --> 00:23:31.300
Most of them are between the
orbits of Mars and Jupiter,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.819
but there are other families
that are elsewhere.

00:23:33.819 --> 00:23:37.604
Some of these other families,
it has been suggested,

00:23:37.604 --> 00:23:41.364
come from the asteroid belt,
but they've had collisions or

00:23:41.364 --> 00:23:43.691
other catastrophes,
and have been bumped into

00:23:43.691 --> 00:23:46.395
different orbits.
But most of the asteroids are

00:23:46.395 --> 00:23:49.385
between Mars and Jupiter.
Now, out beyond the asteroid

00:23:49.385 --> 00:23:52.308
belt are a number of other
planets, and much of what we

00:23:52.308 --> 00:23:55.663
know about these other planets
come from a couple of satellites

00:23:55.663 --> 00:23:58.710
that look kind of like this.
These are the Voyager

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:02.009
satellites that were launched in
the 1970s and have been

00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:05.309
traveling through the Outer
Solar System ever since.

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:07.380
This is a clever thing that
they did.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.340
It turned out that in the '70s
and '80s, the outer planets,

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:14.153
Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune were

00:24:14.153 --> 00:24:18.114
aligned in such a way that one
satellite could catch them all

00:24:18.114 --> 00:24:21.131
as they went past.
And each time it goes past one

00:24:21.131 --> 00:24:23.361
of these things,
it uses the gravitational

00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:26.680
attraction of that planet to
swing itself to the next one,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.730
and then to the next one,
and then to the next one.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.987
And so, these wonderful
satellites, for many years,

00:24:31.987 --> 00:24:35.049
gave us pictures of one planet
after another,

00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:39.769
which we now know quite a lot
more about than we used to.

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:44.015
So, here's Jupiter,
this is by far the most massive

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:46.505
planet.
Here you've got the famous red

00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:48.280
spot.
All that you see here is

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:51.200
atmosphere, and it's got very
elaborate weather.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.703
And the red spot,
it turns out to be a hurricane

00:24:54.703 --> 00:24:57.759
that has persisted for about 350
years.

00:24:57.759 --> 00:25:00.552
To us, it seems like an almost
permanent feature,

00:25:00.552 --> 00:25:02.880
although it's gotten fainter
recently.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.626
But it's sort of as
if--supposing you were a race of

00:25:06.626 --> 00:25:09.932
creatures whose lifetime was
about half a day,

00:25:09.932 --> 00:25:12.650
and you were observing the
Earth.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:16.211
And you observed it for many
lifetimes, and you saw the same

00:25:16.211 --> 00:25:19.349
hurricane sitting down somewhere
in the Caribbean.

00:25:19.349 --> 00:25:22.007
You would think that that
little spot was kind of a

00:25:22.007 --> 00:25:24.557
permanent feature,
and that seems to be what this

00:25:24.557 --> 00:25:25.839
is.
It's a sort of really

00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:28.276
long-lasting hurricane.
If you have--they have

00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:31.237
time-lapse movies of this.
You can find them on the

00:25:31.237 --> 00:25:34.562
Internet, where you can see that
the wind is actually circulating

00:25:34.562 --> 00:25:36.195
there.
Jupiter has moons,

00:25:36.195 --> 00:25:39.951
many of them--these--the four
big ones you see here are the

00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:43.708
so-called "Galilean" moons,
because they were discovered by

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.410
Galileo.
They've also included a little

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.117
one.
There are many dozens of moons

00:25:48.117 --> 00:25:50.131
this size.
The moons--each of the moons

00:25:50.131 --> 00:25:52.170
has its own peculiar
characteristics.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.299
I'm quite fond of this one,
this is the innermost moon.

00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:57.762
It's called Io,
sometimes referred to as the

00:25:57.762 --> 00:26:01.276
pepperoni pizza moon.
And it's got the most elaborate

00:26:01.276 --> 00:26:04.110
volcanoes anywhere in the Solar
System.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.993
It spews up sulfur all the time.
And then, this sulfur sort of

00:26:08.993 --> 00:26:11.720
melts and flows all over the
surface, and that's what gives

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.307
it its particular color.
Each of the other moons has

00:26:14.307 --> 00:26:16.259
interesting characteristics of
its own.

00:26:16.259 --> 00:26:20.388
Here's an interesting thing
that the Voyager satellites

00:26:20.388 --> 00:26:24.440
discovered: they discovered that
Jupiter has rings.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.079
It was not thought that Jupiter
had rings;

00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:28.349
from the Earth,
you can't see them.

00:26:28.349 --> 00:26:31.238
But from close up,
it became apparent that Jupiter

00:26:31.238 --> 00:26:33.420
has rings the same way Saturn
does.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.528
But, of course,
the Saturn rings are the most

00:26:35.528 --> 00:26:37.016
spectacular.
Here's Saturn,

00:26:37.016 --> 00:26:39.414
the next planet out.
You can see that it,

00:26:39.414 --> 00:26:41.880
too, has weather-banded things
down here.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:45.015
And then it has these very
spectacular rings,

00:26:45.015 --> 00:26:48.792
seen here from various
different angles as Saturn goes

00:26:48.792 --> 00:26:51.470
through its orbit.
And these rings,

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.036
we know now,
are made up of individual

00:26:54.036 --> 00:26:56.981
little chunks of things.
The Voyager Mission,

00:26:56.981 --> 00:26:59.607
this is obviously
artificially-colored so that you

00:26:59.607 --> 00:27:01.589
could see all the different
rings.

00:27:01.589 --> 00:27:04.011
And each one of those rings is
made up of many,

00:27:04.011 --> 00:27:08.069
many, many little rocks.
Saturn too has moons.

00:27:08.069 --> 00:27:10.150
This is Titan,
Saturn's big moon.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:12.907
And you can see from here,
in this particular picture,

00:27:12.907 --> 00:27:15.990
that Titan has an atmosphere.
That makes it very interesting.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.158
People have the feeling that at
places where there are

00:27:19.158 --> 00:27:21.610
atmospheres are potential
sources of life,

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.540
and so people find Titan an
interesting moon.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.859
I actually like this one better.
This is Mimas.

00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:30.905
It's just a rocky moon,
but you can see it's kind of

00:27:30.905 --> 00:27:34.009
got the great grandmother of all
craters up there.

00:27:34.009 --> 00:27:37.234
This thing got slammed into by
some asteroid that was just

00:27:37.234 --> 00:27:40.289
barely not big enough to blow
the whole thing apart,

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:43.990
but it raised this big pucker
on the side of the moon.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:48.049
Moving out to the next planet,
which is Uranus.

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:50.786
In ordinary light,
you can't actually see any

00:27:50.786 --> 00:27:52.435
features.
Again, you're looking at the

00:27:52.435 --> 00:27:54.200
atmosphere;
there are clouds.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:58.351
But this picture was taken in a
particular kind of red light,

00:27:58.351 --> 00:28:00.980
which brings out the cloud
features.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.421
And what you can see is,
it's got a banded structure,

00:28:04.421 --> 00:28:07.664
the same as Jupiter and Saturn,
but interestingly,

00:28:07.664 --> 00:28:11.987
the bands are on its side.
One of the peculiar features of

00:28:11.987 --> 00:28:16.284
Uranus is that it rotates
sideways, rather than kind of up

00:28:16.284 --> 00:28:19.300
and down, uniquely among the
planets.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.109
This planet, too, has rings.
It also has moons.

00:28:23.109 --> 00:28:27.150
Here's another favorite moon of
mine, this is Miranda.

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.753
And this looks like what
happened was that it actually

00:28:29.753 --> 00:28:32.356
did get blown apart by some
impact, but then fell back

00:28:32.356 --> 00:28:34.956
together again.
And you can see that it looks

00:28:34.956 --> 00:28:38.233
like it's been chopped into
pieces and then sort of thrown

00:28:38.233 --> 00:28:41.856
back into--together again.
Moving out to the next planet,

00:28:41.856 --> 00:28:44.720
here's Neptune.
Neptune, again, has weather.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.115
Here is the big,
dark spot on Neptune,

00:28:48.115 --> 00:28:51.970
similar to the big,
red spot on Jupiter.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.577
This little cloud here is
called Scooter,

00:28:54.577 --> 00:28:58.097
because it moves faster than
the rest of the weather on

00:28:58.097 --> 00:29:00.093
Neptune.
It's actually kind of a mystery

00:29:00.093 --> 00:29:02.441
how come Neptune has all this
weather, because it's very cold

00:29:02.441 --> 00:29:04.022
out there.
There isn't a whole lot of

00:29:04.022 --> 00:29:06.496
energy that should be in the
atmosphere, and nobody can quite

00:29:06.496 --> 00:29:08.270
figure out how this is supposed
to work.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.861
Neptune has moons.
Here's Neptune's biggest moon,

00:29:11.861 --> 00:29:14.059
this is Triton.
You can see this sort of

00:29:14.059 --> 00:29:16.609
frontier here between two types
of topography,

00:29:16.609 --> 00:29:20.345
sort of moves around,
and that is thought to be due

00:29:20.345 --> 00:29:23.703
to weather of various
kinds--methane snow,

00:29:23.703 --> 00:29:26.492
stuff like that.
And then, by now,

00:29:26.492 --> 00:29:29.682
this was the last planet
Voyager II examined,

00:29:29.682 --> 00:29:33.815
and then it went past and it
took this--took a lovely shot

00:29:33.815 --> 00:29:36.569
looking back at the Solar
System.

00:29:36.569 --> 00:29:41.579
Here is Neptune and Triton as
the Voyager Mission moved out

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:46.329
into the Outer Solar System
beyond the large planets.

00:29:46.329 --> 00:29:51.109
Now, Pluto wasn't aligned
properly to take part in this.

00:29:51.109 --> 00:29:53.329
This is--these are pictures of
Pluto.

00:29:53.329 --> 00:29:54.450
This is a picture of Pluto from
the ground.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.090
Here it is from the space
telescope.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:59.365
As you can see, it's got a moon.
This is kind of all we know

00:29:59.365 --> 00:30:02.514
about Pluto at the moment.
There is a spacecraft that is

00:30:02.514 --> 00:30:05.881
currently on route to Pluto,
and when it arrives there a

00:30:05.881 --> 00:30:08.880
couple of decades from now--a
decade from now,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.205
I guess, we'll know much more.
Now, you may be aware that

00:30:12.205 --> 00:30:15.380
there was a little bit of fuss
about Pluto over the summer.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.369
Let me show you why.
Here it is.

00:30:19.369 --> 00:30:20.680
This is what all the fuss is
about.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.380
This is three pictures,
sort of shown as a movie.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.859
See this thing over here that's
moving?

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:29.990
That's moving because,
unlike all the other objects in

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:33.108
this picture,
that thing is not a distant

00:30:33.108 --> 00:30:35.590
star.
That is a planet in the Outer

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.793
Solar System.
This is the one that for a

00:30:37.793 --> 00:30:40.119
while was called Xena,
now it's called Eris.

00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:43.289
And these are the discovery
photographs of this.

00:30:43.289 --> 00:30:47.052
Then as they kept taking
pictures, they could plot the

00:30:47.052 --> 00:30:48.993
orbit.
They determined the orbit of

00:30:48.993 --> 00:30:51.690
the thing using an equation
you've already discovered.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:53.500
They figure out how far away it
is.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.956
From how far away it is and how
bright it is,

00:30:55.956 --> 00:30:57.910
you can figure out how big it
is.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.184
And the problem that Eris
presents is, it's bigger than

00:31:01.184 --> 00:31:04.720
Pluto.
And there are a whole bunch of

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:10.108
other things out there that have
also been discovered,

00:31:10.108 --> 00:31:13.869
also as big,
or bigger than Pluto.

00:31:13.869 --> 00:31:16.250
Here are the eight currently
largest-known,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:19.480
so-called "trans-Neptunian"
objects, sometimes also called

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.417
Kuiper Belt objects.
Here's Eris,

00:31:21.417 --> 00:31:23.630
here's Pluto,
here are a bunch of other ones.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.999
They find these things,
like, one or two of them a

00:31:25.999 --> 00:31:28.611
year, now, and so we can
confidently expect that twenty

00:31:28.611 --> 00:31:30.802
years from now,
there are going to 100 such

00:31:30.802 --> 00:31:32.628
things.
So you have the problem--oh you

00:31:32.628 --> 00:31:35.339
should--it's worth nothing,
these things also have moons,

00:31:35.339 --> 00:31:40.083
and some of them have a
moon-to-planet ratio similar to

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:43.990
the Earth and the moon.
But here's the Earth for scale.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.096
All of them,
including Pluto and Eris,

00:31:46.096 --> 00:31:48.089
very much smaller than the
Earth.

00:31:48.089 --> 00:31:50.250
And so you've got yourself a
problem.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.931
If you're going to count Pluto,
how do you not count these

00:31:53.931 --> 00:31:56.128
other things?
And so the first suggestion

00:31:56.128 --> 00:31:58.857
was, well, you ought to count
Pluto, and you ought to count a

00:31:58.857 --> 00:32:01.908
bunch of these other things too.
And so, there was going to be

00:32:01.908 --> 00:32:03.819
twelve planets,
or something like that,

00:32:03.819 --> 00:32:05.680
and presumably,
many more to come.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.054
And then people decided,
you know, the heck with this

00:32:08.054 --> 00:32:10.532
whole bunch of things.
We'll give them a different

00:32:10.532 --> 00:32:12.025
name;
we won't call them planets at

00:32:12.025 --> 00:32:14.305
all.
And that was what was finally

00:32:14.305 --> 00:32:17.670
determined, leading to all sorts
of, you know,

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:21.084
"Save Pluto" campaigns from
disgruntled third-graders

00:32:21.084 --> 00:32:23.973
who--[laughter]
yes, thank you very much--who

00:32:23.973 --> 00:32:27.715
were unhappy about having to
re-memorize all the mnemonics

00:32:27.715 --> 00:32:31.130
that tell you the planets in the
Solar System.

00:32:31.130 --> 00:32:33.672
Actually, if you included
things like Quaoar,

00:32:33.672 --> 00:32:36.677
you'll get yourself into
trouble trying to learn them

00:32:36.677 --> 00:32:39.217
all.
And they're finding lots of

00:32:39.217 --> 00:32:43.038
lots of these things.
Okay, so just a little about

00:32:43.038 --> 00:32:45.700
the geography of the Solar
System.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.226
Here's the Inner Solar System
out to the orbit of Jupiter,

00:32:48.226 --> 00:32:51.247
with the asteroids and stuff.
Here's the Outer Solar System,

00:32:51.247 --> 00:32:53.248
starting with Jupiter.
Here's Pluto,

00:32:53.248 --> 00:32:56.541
and you'll notice that Pluto
really is an elliptical orbit,

00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:59.210
much more elliptical than the
other planets.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.660
It also turns out the orbit is
tipped.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.542
All the other planets--the
orbits are in the same plane as

00:33:04.542 --> 00:33:06.568
each other.
Pluto's orbit is tipped out of

00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:08.968
the plane.
Here's one of the--these other

00:33:08.968 --> 00:33:11.500
trans-Neptunian objects.
Here's its orbit,

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.520
and you can see that it goes
way, way out and is highly

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:16.869
elliptical, very much out of the
plane.

00:33:16.869 --> 00:33:18.856
This is, in general,
true of these,

00:33:18.856 --> 00:33:22.070
what are now called "dwarf
planets," or "trans-Neptunian

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:24.349
objects," or "Kuiper Belt
objects."

00:33:24.349 --> 00:33:27.662
But it's also true that there
is a further component of the

00:33:27.662 --> 00:33:30.813
Solar System even beyond that.
Here's Sedna's orbit--that

00:33:30.813 --> 00:33:33.459
again is Sedna's orbit,
so we've now gone up a degree

00:33:33.459 --> 00:33:36.163
in scale.
And then there's this whole

00:33:36.163 --> 00:33:41.048
cloud of stuff out there called
the Oort cloud and this is--this

00:33:41.048 --> 00:33:44.859
is where the comets live.
Comets are sort of ice balls.

00:33:44.859 --> 00:33:47.106
We can't see them individually
in the Oort cloud,

00:33:47.106 --> 00:33:49.821
but sometimes they collide with
each other, and one of them

00:33:49.821 --> 00:33:51.600
falls into the Inner Solar
System.

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.563
And as it does, it heats up.
It's made out of ice,

00:33:55.563 --> 00:33:57.507
the ice melts,
gets--streams backward,

00:33:57.507 --> 00:33:59.819
and we get these very
spectacular things.

00:33:59.819 --> 00:34:03.496
Comets cause all kinds of
mayhem, they kill dinosaurs,

00:34:03.496 --> 00:34:06.132
for example,
and recently we've seen an

00:34:06.132 --> 00:34:08.645
example of this.
This is a comet called

00:34:08.645 --> 00:34:11.510
Shoemaker-Levy that's broken up
into a bunch of pieces.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.449
And in 1994,
those pieces slammed into

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:18.818
Jupiter, and here you see the
various--the effect of the

00:34:18.818 --> 00:34:22.789
various pieces of this comet
that hit Jupiter.

00:34:22.789 --> 00:34:26.590
And so, comets can be dangerous
things when they land on your

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.965
planet.
Okay, this is the Outer Solar

00:34:29.965 --> 00:34:32.895
System again.
Here's the tipped orbit of

00:34:32.895 --> 00:34:34.570
Pluto.
That's the orbit of Neptune.

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.512
Here's Voyager I,
Voyager II traveling now

00:34:37.512 --> 00:34:39.744
outward.
They are escaping from the

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:43.292
Solar System.
And the very edges of the Sun's

00:34:43.292 --> 00:34:48.492
influence, where you might say
the Solar System ends and the

00:34:48.492 --> 00:34:52.900
interstellar medium begins,
are indicated here.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.148
Each of these things means a
slightly different boundary to

00:34:56.148 --> 00:34:58.797
the Sun's influence.
But the Voyagers are going to

00:34:58.797 --> 00:35:01.436
get there sometime in our
lifetime, so they will be the

00:35:01.436 --> 00:35:04.173
first man-made things that
actually pass out of our Solar

00:35:04.173 --> 00:35:07.929
System.
And that's as far as this goes.

00:35:07.929 --> 00:35:12.230
Let me turn the lights back on,
here.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:17.260
Okay, so much for the Solar
System.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:20.324
Now.
Here's the important question:

00:35:20.324 --> 00:35:24.380
I just threw a whole bunch of
facts at you.

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.389
Facts, information,
pretty pictures.

00:35:26.389 --> 00:35:28.557
We have a lot of facts,
and information,

00:35:28.557 --> 00:35:31.492
and pretty pictures.
The Voyagers took many

00:35:31.492 --> 00:35:35.772
thousands of pictures and
other--acquired other forms of

00:35:35.772 --> 00:35:38.706
information, as well.
There have been many other

00:35:38.706 --> 00:35:40.961
spacecraft flying around our
Solar System for quite some

00:35:40.961 --> 00:35:43.690
time.
We know a lot of things.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.045
Here's the question:
now that you know all this

00:35:46.045 --> 00:35:48.400
stuff, what do you do with that
information?

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:58.590
So, what do you do with all
this Solar System information?

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.429
One thing you could do is,
write it all down and memorize

00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:08.219
it.
I strongly advise against that.

00:36:08.219 --> 00:36:10.699
You know, this is what the
Internet is for.

00:36:10.699 --> 00:36:13.438
There are a whole bunch of
websites out there that'll tell

00:36:13.438 --> 00:36:16.081
you everything you could
possibly want to know about all

00:36:16.081 --> 00:36:18.100
of the objects and all of the
planets,

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:20.989
moons, everything else.
So that isn't actually a

00:36:20.989 --> 00:36:22.681
productive way,
I don't think,

00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:25.730
of spending your time.
So, what would you rather do?

00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:28.734
What would one--what would be a
more productive way of thinking

00:36:28.734 --> 00:36:31.501
about this material?
And now, I want to step back

00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:33.750
and remind you of how science
works.

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.793
Remember the scientific method?
They probably taught you

00:36:36.793 --> 00:36:39.795
something about this when you
were, like, eleven or twelve

00:36:39.795 --> 00:36:41.824
years old.
And you'll remember how this

00:36:41.824 --> 00:36:45.019
works.
So, scientific method--so,

00:36:45.019 --> 00:36:50.409
you have a hypothesis,
which is a fancy word for a

00:36:50.409 --> 00:36:53.806
guess.
Maybe you have competing

00:36:53.806 --> 00:36:57.062
hypotheses.
And on the basis of this

00:36:57.062 --> 00:37:01.340
hypothesis you formulate some
kind of experiment.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.489
Good experiments are sometimes
called "controlled" experiments.

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:07.980
And on the basis of the results
of the experiment,

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.470
you determine how much you
believe the hypothesis,

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:12.300
or which hypothesis you
believe.

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.098
And then, you know,
you may modify your hypothesis

00:37:15.098 --> 00:37:18.409
or change it all together,
and then do more experiments.

00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:22.106
And by iterating this
procedure, you develop an

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:27.170
understanding of whatever it is
you're trying to think about.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:32.039
Okay.
No.

00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:35.349
Not really, certainly not in
astronomy.

00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:37.849
Astronomy doesn't work this way
at all.

00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:40.800
Think about what an experiment
would be in astronomy.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:44.976
Okay, so here's a ball of gas
the size of the Sun made out of

00:37:44.976 --> 00:37:47.771
pure hydrogen.
Here's another ball of gas the

00:37:47.771 --> 00:37:50.070
size of the Sun made out of pure
helium.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.889
We stick them in the sky and
watch them evolve for ten

00:37:52.889 --> 00:37:54.059
billion years,
okay.

00:37:54.059 --> 00:37:56.710
No, you can't do experiments in
astronomy.

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:00.009
It doesn't work that way at all.
So, there has to be some other

00:38:00.009 --> 00:38:02.992
way of approaching it.
And the reason for this is,

00:38:02.992 --> 00:38:05.788
is that astronomy is not an
experimental science,

00:38:05.788 --> 00:38:08.663
it's an observational science.
This is true of many other

00:38:08.663 --> 00:38:10.377
sciences.
A lot of biology,

00:38:10.377 --> 00:38:14.419
particularly environmental,
or ecological aspects of

00:38:14.419 --> 00:38:18.360
biology, work this way.
All of the social sciences.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.381
You can't do controlled
experiments in child

00:38:21.381 --> 00:38:27.357
development, that's just ugly.
And so, these are observational

00:38:27.357 --> 00:38:33.130
sciences, and this has a
different methodology.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:36.349
And it starts,
as its name would suggest,

00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:39.904
with observations.
And you go out and you find a

00:38:39.904 --> 00:38:42.855
bunch of things,
whether they're butterflies,

00:38:42.855 --> 00:38:45.269
or planets, or whatever they
are.

00:38:45.269 --> 00:38:49.020
And what do you do when you've
found a whole bunch of things?

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.500
What's the next step?
The next step is classification.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:57.860
You put them into categories.
And it's important to get this

00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.680
right.
If you're dealing with,

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.835
for example,
animals, and you classify them

00:39:01.835 --> 00:39:05.170
as things that live in the ocean
and things that live on land,

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:08.679
then you're going to have fish
and whales in the same category.

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:13.001
And you're going to have
lizards and frogs and snakes in

00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:18.030
the same category with people
and bears, and things like that.

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.884
And this isn't going to lead
you to a deep understanding,

00:39:20.884 --> 00:39:23.280
because you haven't got the
categories right.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.610
And so the classification is
very important.

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:29.950
And what it leads to when you
get it right is a useful

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.980
interpretation of what is going
on.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:36.324
This is--interpretation,
it's just a fancy word for a

00:39:36.324 --> 00:39:38.426
good story.
These are the kinds of things

00:39:38.426 --> 00:39:41.574
we write down in textbooks.
The astronomers sometimes

00:39:41.574 --> 00:39:45.040
dignify this with the fancy word
"scenario."

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:48.965
But it's basically a story.
And on the basis of this story,

00:39:48.965 --> 00:39:50.463
you say, well,
we better check out,

00:39:50.463 --> 00:39:52.269
let's see whether this story
holds up.

00:39:52.269 --> 00:39:58.188
Let's do more observations,
and--all of these connections

00:39:58.188 --> 00:40:02.777
work in all directions.
And so, this is actually a

00:40:02.777 --> 00:40:07.047
better description of how an
observational science is done

00:40:07.047 --> 00:40:11.780
than this kind of thing up here.
So now, having gone through

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:16.550
that little piece of philosophy,
let's apply it in practice.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:18.954
I've just described to you some
observations,

00:40:18.954 --> 00:40:21.139
some observations of the Solar
System.

00:40:21.139 --> 00:40:24.297
Now, what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to take those objects

00:40:24.297 --> 00:40:26.402
that I just showed you and
classify them,

00:40:26.402 --> 00:40:30.579
or attempt to.
So let us classify--these are

00:40:30.579 --> 00:40:36.370
now going to be categories of
Solar System objects.

00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:41.642
So, I claim,
or at least,

00:40:41.642 --> 00:40:45.474
it's the start of a good story,
that there are six categories

00:40:45.474 --> 00:40:49.137
of objects in the Solar System.
The first is the Sun,

00:40:49.137 --> 00:40:53.147
which I didn't actually show
you, which is 99% of all of the

00:40:53.147 --> 00:40:57.790
mass in the Solar System,
and almost all of the energy

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:02.529
and heat, and so forth.
Then there are the inner

00:41:02.529 --> 00:41:07.408
planets, sometimes called the
terrestrial planets,

00:41:07.408 --> 00:41:11.590
because the Earth is the prime
example.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:15.438
And these are rocks,
basically that would be

00:41:15.438 --> 00:41:18.659
silicon, iron,
elements like that,

00:41:18.659 --> 00:41:26.813
with a very thin surface
coating of ice,

00:41:26.813 --> 00:41:36.429
in some cases melted,
in some cases gaseous.

00:41:36.429 --> 00:41:39.708
What I mean by ice is not
necessarily water-ice,

00:41:39.708 --> 00:41:42.568
but also things like ammonia,
and methane,

00:41:42.568 --> 00:41:45.150
and other compounds of that
kind.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:48.228
This coating is very thin.
If you had a scale model of the

00:41:48.228 --> 00:41:50.545
Earth that was six feet across
and you put your hand up against

00:41:50.545 --> 00:41:52.313
it,
you wouldn't even feel that it

00:41:52.313 --> 00:41:55.179
was wet from the oceans.
So, not very much.

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:59.043
And these have masses,
these things,

00:41:59.043 --> 00:42:03.017
these inner planets of,
I don't know,

00:42:03.017 --> 00:42:08.789
10^(-7) to 10^(-5) of the Sun.
And they're in basically

00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:10.220
circular orbits.

00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:19.103
Then you've got the asteroids,
which are irregular,

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:26.179
very small rocks in--mostly in
orbits between Mars and Jupiter.

00:42:26.179 --> 00:42:30.293
And out beyond the asteroids,
you've got the outer planets,

00:42:30.293 --> 00:42:33.130
sometimes called the "Jovian"
planets,

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:37.420
because Jupiter is the prime
example of these things.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.690
And these are quite different
from the inner planets.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:43.201
They've got a lot of gas and
ice, both gas,

00:42:43.201 --> 00:42:47.550
which I'm defining here to be
hydrogen and helium,

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:51.439
and ice, which I'm defining to
be, as I said,

00:42:51.439 --> 00:42:55.769
water, ammonia,
methane, and similar compounds.

00:42:55.769 --> 00:43:03.550
And these are more massive,
10^(-4) to 10^(-3) of the Sun.

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:09.281
They have rings,
many moons, also circular

00:43:09.281 --> 00:43:10.540
orbits.

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.677
And all these orbits,
both these planets and these

00:43:19.677 --> 00:43:22.469
planets are basically in one
plane.

00:43:22.469 --> 00:43:27.231
Out beyond the Jovian planets
are these trans-Neptunian

00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:30.230
objects, or Kuiper Belt objects.

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:39.427
This is Pluto, etcetera.
We don't really know what they

00:43:39.427 --> 00:43:42.663
are yet, but it seems like
they're probably going to be

00:43:42.663 --> 00:43:45.600
rocky, just to judge from their
size and mass.

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.201
So we think they're rocky.
They're a low mass,

00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:53.050
less than 10^(-7) of the mass
of the Sun.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:44:00.662
And they are in elliptical and
inclined orbits,

00:44:00.662 --> 00:44:04.856
way out there.
And then, finally,

00:44:04.856 --> 00:44:09.067
in the outer region,
in this so-called Oort cloud,

00:44:09.067 --> 00:44:13.449
you have the comets,
which are little snowballs.

00:44:13.449 --> 00:44:17.308
Balls of ice,
again, ice in this generic

00:44:17.308 --> 00:44:19.980
sense.
So, here are the six categories

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.769
that I would claim exist in the
Solar System.

00:44:22.769 --> 00:44:26.050
And here's my problem with the
whole Pluto debate.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:29.125
The Pluto debate was basically
about whether these guys are

00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:31.845
going to count as planets.
But the thing is,

00:44:31.845 --> 00:44:36.059
"planets" is already a bad
description, because it contains

00:44:36.059 --> 00:44:40.208
two quite different categories;
namely, these inner terrestrial

00:44:40.208 --> 00:44:42.320
planets, and the outer Jovian
planets.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:46.359
So, it seems to me that arguing
whether category five should be

00:44:46.359 --> 00:44:49.356
part of some category that
already contains two

00:44:49.356 --> 00:44:53.265
fundamentally different kinds of
objects is kind of a strange

00:44:53.265 --> 00:44:56.568
argument to be having.
Either we should split these

00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:59.576
two things off from each other,
or, if we're going to join

00:44:59.576 --> 00:45:01.530
these two kinds of the
categories,

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.150
fine, bring in anything you
like.

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:04.465
I don't care,
add the asteroids,

00:45:04.465 --> 00:45:05.514
too.
And, in fact,

00:45:05.514 --> 00:45:08.877
in the original proposal,
one of the asteroids qualified

00:45:08.877 --> 00:45:11.902
as well.
And so, it doesn't seem to me

00:45:11.902 --> 00:45:17.092
that this controversy was really
paying justice to an appropriate

00:45:17.092 --> 00:45:21.310
classification of the things in
the Solar System.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:25.885
Okay, so now.
Having classified it,

00:45:25.885 --> 00:45:29.980
the next step is
interpretation.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.218
And, I think I will leave
that--let's see,

00:45:33.218 --> 00:45:36.837
how are we doing for time?
Yes, I'll leave that one for

00:45:36.837 --> 00:45:39.327
next time.
So the question is going to be:

00:45:39.327 --> 00:45:42.077
now that you have these six
kinds of objects,

00:45:42.077 --> 00:45:45.327
what is the story you tell
about how the Solar System

00:45:45.327 --> 00:45:47.644
evolved?
And what, in turn,

00:45:47.644 --> 00:45:52.241
does that tell you about what
other kinds of planets you

00:45:52.241 --> 00:45:54.307
should see around other stars?

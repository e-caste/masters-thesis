00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.549
Prof: We're discussing
the fertility transition and

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:17.170
we've talked that prior to the
fertility transition there was

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.130
control of fertility,
but it was at a very high level.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.253
In different parts of the world
we talked in very general terms

00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:29.340
about it.
 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.336
I want to just describe a
little bit about what the story

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:36.119
was in Europe,
exactly how fertility was

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:37.190
controlled.
 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.586
One of the main reasons,
I mentioned this before,

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:44.550
but didn't really describe it,
is control of marriage.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.042
That the number of people that
were allowed to,

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:51.231
and in some sense,
get married changed with

00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:55.180
economic conditions and
agricultural conditions.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.293
You can see that very clearly
wherever you get statistics from

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:00.170
the period.
 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.792
As you know,
the first year of the Black

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:08.506
Death was 1347-1348,
and huge numbers of people died

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:13.409
and their land was immediately
taken over by someone else.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.970
Immediately these new
landowners got married.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.840
There was an enormous burst of
marriage.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.706
Like in one small French
village there had been 10 to 12

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:26.730
marriages a year in the
preceding decade.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.870
In 1349, the first year after
that phase of the plague passed

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.125
it went from 10 to 12,
to 86 marriages,

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:37.010
an enormous thing.
 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.312
What was going on is there
was--before the Black Death when

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:47.524
Europe was crowded for its
system there was a huge pool of

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:53.010
unmarried individuals who really
wanted to get married,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.197
but did not have any land on
which to support themselves or a

00:01:58.197 --> 00:02:03.125
family and the opening of the
land allows marriage to take

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:03.989
place.
 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.879
Then not only did they get
married right away,

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.218
but the women got pregnant
immediately,

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:13.150
and one contemporary observer
wrote,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.219
"There are pregnant women
wherever you look."

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.568
This is 1349.
 

00:02:19.568 --> 00:02:24.568
Up--this fertility rate was a
flexible system that moved up

00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:29.740
and down according to economic
and demographic conditions.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.848
In England, there's data from
the 1550s and later,

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:37.199
the gross reproduction rate,
that's the number of women--

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.974
there are a certain number of
women in one generation how many

00:02:40.974 --> 00:02:43.080
female children do they produce?
 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.179
In the 1550s it was 2.8,
so one will reproduce a woman,

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.203
the gross reproduction rate
will be one, but they were

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:52.568
producing 2.8.
 

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:58.830
A century later it drops down
to 1.8 and that's the 1650s,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.568
and by 1880s it rises again to
over three,

00:03:02.568 --> 00:03:07.060
so there's enormous range
between one,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.254
close to one,
less than two,

00:03:09.254 --> 00:03:13.646
just reproducing themselves
getting into this dangerous

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:16.554
thing where--
with the very high death rates,

00:03:16.554 --> 00:03:19.210
where the whole society at that
rate won't continue--

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:29.169
and a factor of three women
which will do just fine.

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.034
You can see the same thing at
the age of marriage,

00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:35.133
not only the numbers of
marriage of course but the age

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:36.068
of marriage.
 

00:03:36.068 --> 00:03:39.260
During the early 1800s remember
that was a time when the

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.044
American food is there,
European population was rising,

00:03:43.044 --> 00:03:46.860
strong as a high birth rate so
land hunger became--

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.301
land--there was no extra land
available so marriage became

00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:54.282
later and later,
and eventually reached 23 to 28

00:03:54.282 --> 00:03:58.669
for females and even older than
that for males.

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:03.658
By that time probably the
average lifespan was 35,

00:04:03.658 --> 00:04:08.030
it had improved some,
but if you're fertile at say 15

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.354
and you don't marry until 28,
that's a huge chunk of your

00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:15.318
reproductive life where you're
not reproducing,

00:04:15.318 --> 00:04:20.569
that reduces the birth rate and
keeps the population in check.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:26.389
However, once in marriage,
the children just flowed.

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.127
There was no--apparently no
control within marriage

00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:31.100
whatsoever.
 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.521
In 300 years--all the data that
we have says that in 300 years

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:42.120
in Europe there was no control
of fertility within marriage,

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.697
all the control,
all the social control of

00:04:44.697 --> 00:04:47.779
population was in how many
people got married,

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.934
what they called the nuptiality;
the fraction of people that got

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:55.660
married was the total mechanism
of social control.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.259
There's of course external
control by disease,

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.810
by famines because some plague
of the plants,

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.704
and then there were individual
controls which we've talked

00:05:06.704 --> 00:05:08.959
about infanticide and so forth.
 

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:12.470
In terms of social controls,
the northwestern--

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.338
the Northern Europeans,
especially northwestern

00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:20.882
European model was controlled
marriage and it was quite

00:05:20.882 --> 00:05:22.060
effective.
 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.148
These marriage controls didn't
just happen automatically,

00:05:26.148 --> 00:05:30.382
people just didn't sort of have
a rational sense that said,

00:05:30.382 --> 00:05:32.500
'Oh I can't get married.'
 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.930
There was really--the controls
were forced upon them.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:41.053
Most land was owned by some
landowner and the man was given

00:05:41.053 --> 00:05:44.959
a plot of land which he could
work.

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:48.329
It was the size so that one
individual could work this plot

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.910
of land.
 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.990
He starts having children.
 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.997
Well the landlord knows that
only one son is needed to farm

00:05:56.997 --> 00:06:01.966
that land,
and the father knows he can

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:08.937
only give that land to one son,
so there's tremendous pressure

00:06:08.937 --> 00:06:12.870
if you have extra children they
can't stay at home.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.290
You'll see when we talk about
China a very different model.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.394
He can't stay at home,
those people are forced off to

00:06:18.394 --> 00:06:20.992
the cities,
and in the cities are very

00:06:20.992 --> 00:06:23.569
dangerous and disease ridden
places,

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:27.714
so they just die in the cities,
and the cities are growing this

00:06:27.714 --> 00:06:31.259
time but very high death rates
still in the cities.

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.745
About one-third,
each generation had to be

00:06:34.745 --> 00:06:40.103
replenished as I've mentioned to
you, but about one-third in the

00:06:40.103 --> 00:06:41.040
cities.
 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.795
The landlord of course didn't
want these extra children around

00:06:44.795 --> 00:06:48.367
because he would have more and
more people to feed with the

00:06:48.367 --> 00:06:52.310
same amount of land therefore
the same amount of production.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.137
You had to get the landlord's
permission in order to get

00:06:56.137 --> 00:07:00.521
married and if you didn't--if he
didn't have extra land for you,

00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:02.540
you couldn't get married.
 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.173
Of course officially it wasn't
the landlord but it was the

00:07:05.173 --> 00:07:07.670
local parish church that you had
to get married in,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.399
but guess who hired the parish
minister or priest?

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:14.970
The local landlord,
and the whole structure of

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.651
churches almost everywhere is
that they are very much either

00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:23.699
controlled by or mutual support
of the gentry,

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:30.009
the rich people and the
religious authorities intermix.

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:34.172
They weren't allowed to get
married either by the landlord

00:07:34.172 --> 00:07:35.560
or by the church.
 

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.598
It was very--you had to post
what they called banns so

00:07:37.598 --> 00:07:39.100
everybody knew there was a
marriage,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:40.819
and of course the landlord
would notice,

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:47.470
and so it was impossible to do
anything about that.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.170
Another mechanism was going off
and becoming a servant that was

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.430
one of the very standard kinds
of things.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:01.009
They would leave home very
young become a servant and--

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:03.660
males and females both servants
in the houses,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.009
you've all seen these Victorian
movies and earlier movies,

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:08.920
how many servants they have.
 

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.579
Of course they were never
allowed to get married,

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:14.278
not allowed to have sex,
no boyfriend,

00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:15.949
no girlfriend,
none of that was allowed--

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:19.564
very, very strict rules on
house servants and house

00:08:19.564 --> 00:08:23.759
servants were a very large
faction of the young people--

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:30.399
of everybody in, say, England.
 

00:08:30.399 --> 00:08:33.711
Then those that didn't become
servants would go off and become

00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:34.580
an apprentice.
 

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:38.009
One son stays at home,
the others go off and become

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:40.995
apprentices,
and apprenticeship was a very

00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:45.041
long period of time in which
they had to learn the skills and

00:08:45.041 --> 00:08:48.547
get some sort of resources so
that they could buy the

00:08:48.547 --> 00:08:53.200
equipment and rent the shop and
set up eventually on their own,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.506
or wait until the master died
and then inherit the master's

00:08:58.506 --> 00:08:59.240
place.
 

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.532
The end result of all this is
that it took many,

00:09:03.532 --> 00:09:08.736
many years to establish a
sufficient economic base so that

00:09:08.736 --> 00:09:13.029
the society would allow you to
get married.

00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:17.721
Many people never got married;
I'll show you a little bit

00:09:17.721 --> 00:09:21.609
later what the marriage rates
actually were in Europe during

00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:24.309
this period, and its
surprisingly low.

00:09:24.309 --> 00:09:26.370
The culture adapts to this.
 

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.029
What do all these unmarried men
and women do?

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:35.192
We have the spinster woman;
we have the confirmed bachelor,

00:09:35.192 --> 00:09:38.551
again you've seen men in much
British comedy and British

00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:40.711
movies about--
always has characters in it

00:09:40.711 --> 00:09:44.490
where some confirmed bachelor,
he's just not getting married.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.620
Presumably a fair amount of the
homosexuality that was present,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.979
especially in the British upper
classes is due to this whole

00:09:51.979 --> 00:09:55.509
tradition that a lot of males
are not going to get married,

00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:59.289
and then they do something with
their sexual impulse.

00:09:59.289 --> 00:10:03.524
Of course that's not proven;
we don't really understand the

00:10:03.524 --> 00:10:05.928
basis of homosexuality.
 

00:10:05.928 --> 00:10:08.820
Females were also,
like the males,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.494
forced off the land,
if they were not the wife of

00:10:12.494 --> 00:10:15.480
the one son that inherited the
land,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.427
they had to go somewhere else
so they went to the cities where

00:10:18.427 --> 00:10:22.717
there were not jobs,
especially not jobs for women

00:10:22.717 --> 00:10:27.870
so they become sort of a
floating population,

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.942
very largely prostitutes--huge
explosion of prostitution at

00:10:31.942 --> 00:10:36.157
this time both because of the
excess women that are trying to

00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:39.740
stay alive that have migrated
into the cities,

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:44.671
and there's all these bachelors
there having some sort of job

00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:47.629
that could pay for their
services.

00:10:47.629 --> 00:10:54.970
Of course you know that babies
that resulted from any of these

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:02.190
situations were very often just
abandoned and left to die.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:07.129
This control of marriage,
that marriage was the control,

00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:11.341
the social control on
population lasted well into the

00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:14.283
1800s,
well into and possibly even

00:11:14.283 --> 00:11:16.500
through the Victorian era.
 

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.149
These mechanisms together
reduced the north European

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:24.442
birthrate, and especially in
England, to about 50% of what it

00:11:24.442 --> 00:11:26.590
otherwise could have been.
 

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.023
Remember we did calculations of
how many children one can have,

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:34.956
and then there's always
examples much to the high end of

00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:35.600
that.
 

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.196
But in England taking a
reasonable number,

00:11:39.196 --> 00:11:44.019
these controls of marriage cut
the birthrate in half.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:50.330
What did it feel like to the
people involved in this?

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:56.070
I suspect a fair number of you
have heard this quote.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.158
It's a letter from a woman to
her uncle.

00:12:00.158 --> 00:12:03.490
Don't shout out but raise your
hand if you know it.

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.990
"I think dearest uncle
that you cannot really wish me

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.509
to be the mother of a numerous
family,

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:14.431
for I think you will see the
great inconvenience in a large

00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:17.908
family would be the hardship to
myself.

00:12:17.908 --> 00:12:22.075
Men never think what a hard
task it is for us women to go

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:25.200
through this pregnancy very
often."

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.308
Have you heard this?
 

00:12:26.308 --> 00:12:28.500
No, no one's heard this letter,
it's very famous.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.629
This is a woman in this
situation.

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:33.725
She's married,
and therefore she's having

00:12:33.725 --> 00:12:36.658
children one after the other
with no kind of control,

00:12:36.658 --> 00:12:39.114
and she's complaining,
'this is hard on me and why

00:12:39.114 --> 00:12:41.668
don't you men ever think how
hard this is on me?'

00:12:41.668 --> 00:12:44.270
What social class,
is this a poor woman,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:46.940
middle class woman,
upper class woman?

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:54.340
Having all this--no ideas;
it's Queen Victoria.

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.279
Here's by far the richest woman
in the world,

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:59.153
has all the help,
all the money,

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:01.089
all the food,
and, even for her,

00:13:01.089 --> 00:13:04.322
it's a burden and she probably
doesn't have to do much of the

00:13:04.322 --> 00:13:07.340
burden except handle the
pregnancy and childbearing,

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:11.340
and if she perceives it as a
burden,

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:14.860
then can you imagine what the
common woman thinks of it.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:22.988
By the way, it's Queen Victoria
to her uncle who is King Leopold

00:13:22.988 --> 00:13:28.019
of Belgium, you've heard this
before.

00:13:28.019 --> 00:13:44.836
When sexuality itself since--a
lot of problems with sexuality

00:13:44.836 --> 00:13:49.038
at that time.
 

00:13:49.038 --> 00:13:52.120
You've been reading some stuff
about it,

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.833
and one of the things is that
men, aside from the childbirth

00:13:55.833 --> 00:13:59.610
aspect of it that women were of
course always worried that if

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.639
they had sex they would get
pregnant and often they didn't--

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:06.928
usually they did not want to
get pregnant,

00:14:06.928 --> 00:14:12.120
but also the men were not very
skilled.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.736
They either did not know how to
pleasure a woman,

00:14:15.736 --> 00:14:19.278
they didn't want to,
or they thought it was very

00:14:19.278 --> 00:14:22.668
improper to even try to pleasure
a woman.

00:14:22.668 --> 00:14:27.850
Here's another quote from Lady
Alice Huntington--

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.846
Hillingdon--1857,
she died only in 1940 so we're

00:14:31.846 --> 00:14:36.269
really coming up to fairly
recent kinds of times,

00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:39.308
and presumably,
this was written in her journal

00:14:39.308 --> 00:14:39.970
in 1912.
 

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.038
No one can find that journal so
they don't know the state of--

00:14:43.038 --> 00:14:46.879
how apocryphal this is,
but this is a quote that again

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:50.870
you've probably heard,
at least part of it.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.356
"I am happy now that
George,"

00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:55.975
her husband,
"calls on my bedchamber

00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:58.070
less frequently then of old.
 

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:02.379
As it is, I now endure but two
calls a week and,

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:04.980
when I hear his steps outside
my door,

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.019
I lie down upon my bed,
close my eyes,

00:15:08.019 --> 00:15:12.220
open my legs and think of
England."

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.586
Sometimes the quote is,
"think of Victoria,"

00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:18.700
but apparently think of England
is the proper--

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.532
again we're not talking about
some poor woman with a brutal

00:15:21.532 --> 00:15:25.159
husband,
as in some Oliver Twist movies,

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:28.450
this is a very high status
lady.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:36.330
How did this change and who was
arrayed against this?

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:40.690
People, women especially,
were not happy with the

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.779
situation.
 

00:15:41.779 --> 00:15:44.168
Young men of course wanted to
get married,

00:15:44.168 --> 00:15:47.647
couldn't until they were old,
and we've talked about that

00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:51.250
situation in Africa where the
bride price is very high,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.610
the old men control the bride
price,

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.249
they don't allow the young men
to get married until there's

00:15:57.249 --> 00:15:58.629
almost a revolution.
 

00:15:58.629 --> 00:16:02.197
This is an aside,
but with respect to the bride

00:16:02.197 --> 00:16:07.082
price, we hear a lot about older
men marrying or having sex with

00:16:07.082 --> 00:16:08.480
younger women.
 

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.769
In the West it's one of the
things we sort of complain

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.730
about,
about other cultures that this

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.587
great disparity in age--
an older man with a younger

00:16:15.587 --> 00:16:15.990
woman.
 

00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:19.269
We tend to blame the man who's
getting married,

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.048
but if you think of it from the
point of view of their society,

00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:24.908
that man has been under the
control of even older guys,

00:16:24.908 --> 00:16:28.193
the really powerful guys,
and so he's been abused and not

00:16:28.193 --> 00:16:30.538
allowed to get married until
he's old.

00:16:30.538 --> 00:16:33.471
The women of his age are
already married to the much

00:16:33.471 --> 00:16:35.769
older guys so this is his only
option.

00:16:35.769 --> 00:16:42.015
Again, within a society these
things all intermingle and form

00:16:42.015 --> 00:16:46.275
a pattern,
not necessarily a good pattern,

00:16:46.275 --> 00:16:50.870
not necessarily a pattern that
the people like,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.009
but it is a tight web.
 

00:16:54.009 --> 00:16:57.933
Coming back to Europe,
there was this unfortunate

00:16:57.933 --> 00:17:02.840
situation where young men
weren't allowed to get married,

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.390
young women weren't allowed to
get married,

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:08.045
once you're in marriage the
sexual mores were so straight

00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:11.374
jacketed that it was not
pleasurable for most of the

00:17:11.374 --> 00:17:14.963
women apparently,
and who knows what the men were

00:17:14.963 --> 00:17:17.195
using,
the Victorian pornography

00:17:17.195 --> 00:17:20.078
during this period is lots of
mistresses,

00:17:20.078 --> 00:17:22.900
lots of prostitution and lots
of being whipped.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.606
They loved to get punished
themselves, which is a

00:17:26.606 --> 00:17:30.855
surprising preponderance of
masochistic sexuality in the

00:17:30.855 --> 00:17:33.788
Victorian literature of that
time.

00:17:33.788 --> 00:17:38.618
At least from our point of
view, sexuality was a mess.

00:17:38.618 --> 00:17:39.868
So some people tried to change
this,

00:17:39.868 --> 00:17:43.980
of course there's always
pioneers, and in England one of

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.818
the pioneers was a man and a
woman,

00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:50.190
Charles Bradlaugh and Annie
Besant.

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:55.782
In 1877 family planning
was--contraception was coming

00:17:55.782 --> 00:18:01.700
into possibility in England and
so they distributed--

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:05.432
printed and distributed what we
would now consider a very mild

00:18:05.432 --> 00:18:07.819
pamphlet about birth control
called,

00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:09.670
The Fruits of Philosophy.
 

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:13.920
It was very abstract and
philosophical.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.519
Of course what happened to them?
 

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:18.836
Arrested, indicted,
and the official indictment

00:18:18.836 --> 00:18:23.161
accused them of 'inciting and
encouraging the subjects of the

00:18:23.161 --> 00:18:26.777
Queen to indecent,
obscene, unnatural,

00:18:26.777 --> 00:18:30.698
and immoral practices,
and to bring them,' the

00:18:30.698 --> 00:18:33.500
citizens of the Queen,
the subjects of the Queen,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.430
'to a state of wickedness,
lewdness, and debauchery.'

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:43.172
This is because they were
saying that--well there's these

00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:49.118
things called condoms around and
why don't you use them.

00:18:49.118 --> 00:18:52.263
This trial was very interesting
in that in a culture there's

00:18:52.263 --> 00:18:54.288
certain things you can't talk
about.

00:18:54.288 --> 00:18:57.273
If something is culturally
forbidden, like almost anything

00:18:57.273 --> 00:19:00.153
to do with sex in marriage,
you just couldn't talk about

00:19:00.153 --> 00:19:00.519
it.
 

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:03.522
Now here's this big trial in
London, very famous,

00:19:03.522 --> 00:19:07.215
all the newspapers are carrying
it, and guess what everybody

00:19:07.215 --> 00:19:08.278
learns about?
 

00:19:08.278 --> 00:19:11.945
Birth control;
and a very big thing and some

00:19:11.945 --> 00:19:14.077
scholars,
some historians

00:19:14.077 --> 00:19:18.144
attribute--there's just the
period when the use of birth

00:19:18.144 --> 00:19:21.838
control is increasing
tremendously in England,

00:19:21.838 --> 00:19:23.808
-- and that this trial
popularized it.

00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:27.970
What did we have something
similar a few years ago in

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.288
America with our President?
 

00:19:30.288 --> 00:19:33.890
Bill Clinton and oral sex,
are you all too young to--

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.604
that was a taboo topic,
you could not discuss it and

00:19:37.604 --> 00:19:40.873
then the right wing,
the conservatives who were

00:19:40.873 --> 00:19:44.365
opposed to this kind of free
sexual activity publicized it

00:19:44.365 --> 00:19:47.213
and publicized,
and publicized it until every

00:19:47.213 --> 00:19:50.583
teenager in America knew about
oral sex and now the data is

00:19:50.583 --> 00:19:54.009
that oral sex has just gone
exponentially down into the high

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:56.450
schools and even junior high
schools.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.130
I could tell you stories about
that, but I won't.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:08.548
With all this moralizing about
it that the religious leaders,

00:20:08.548 --> 00:20:12.913
the political leaders,
the medical doctors said it was

00:20:12.913 --> 00:20:16.265
bad for you,
you've read some of that in

00:20:16.265 --> 00:20:19.345
your reading,
everybody is--they were

00:20:19.345 --> 00:20:21.250
terrorized in a sense.
 

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.361
There was an intellectual
terrorization of the people,

00:20:24.361 --> 00:20:26.240
they feared legal prosecution.
 

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.580
Most of these things were
illegal, to buy things,

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.946
to use things,
to write about them,

00:20:31.946 --> 00:20:33.338
to publish them.
 

00:20:33.338 --> 00:20:36.690
They were told that they would
get physical injury.

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.816
You may have heard that
masturbation will make you blind

00:20:40.816 --> 00:20:45.318
and that--I don't know if any of
your parents said that but I

00:20:45.318 --> 00:20:47.118
heard it in my time.
 

00:20:47.118 --> 00:20:49.259
Mental injury,
if it doesn't make you blind,

00:20:49.259 --> 00:20:53.626
it'll make you crazy,
and deep moral reservations and

00:20:53.626 --> 00:20:58.916
just straight aesthetic distaste
that when the society frowns on

00:20:58.916 --> 00:21:03.703
something we sort of have
incorporated a kind of revulsion

00:21:03.703 --> 00:21:08.240
to anything which society
considers disgusting,

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:11.750
and contraceptives themselves
were considered repulsive,

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.308
unnatural, only for
prostitutes, that kind of thing.

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:19.571
Of course, at that time,
almost--a lot of people were

00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:21.923
starting to do it,
but since you couldn't talk

00:21:21.923 --> 00:21:25.267
about it publicly,
no one knew what everyone else

00:21:25.267 --> 00:21:30.164
was doing so they thought they
had to take this great leap

00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:35.063
themselves in defiance of
everything that their culture is

00:21:35.063 --> 00:21:36.608
telling them.
 

00:21:36.608 --> 00:21:39.766
How did it--what happened an
individual's starting to think

00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:40.910
about these things.
 

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:47.760
We have some interesting--a lot
of interesting stuff referred to

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.608
in the reading.
 

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:52.868
Some of this in your reading is
letters to various pioneers,

00:21:52.868 --> 00:21:57.358
Margaret Sanger or who was it
in England the--

00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.650
I'm blocking on the name of the
clinic in England .

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:04.593
We have letters from women sort
of begging information on how to

00:22:04.593 --> 00:22:07.338
keep from getting pregnant
again.

00:22:07.338 --> 00:22:10.304
A lot of it is not with any
official organizations,

00:22:10.304 --> 00:22:13.682
just women talking to women,
and some of it can be relaxed

00:22:13.682 --> 00:22:15.578
at a little bit later stage.
 

00:22:15.578 --> 00:22:21.246
There's a series of nice
interviews from the 1920s and

00:22:21.246 --> 00:22:27.232
1930s with elderly Italian and
Jewish women in the United

00:22:27.232 --> 00:22:28.410
States.
 

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.880
They talked to each other about
technique,

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.940
because techniques is one of
the things,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:38.982
and this interview is from an
Italian American woman born in

00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:39.666
the U.S.
 

00:22:39.666 --> 00:22:44.282
in 1920, recent immigrant
parents, and the conversation

00:22:44.282 --> 00:22:47.190
took place in the late 1930s.
 

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:52.088
She works in a hair dressing
salon and she gets engaged,

00:22:52.088 --> 00:22:55.009
and of course all her coworkers
know about it,

00:22:55.009 --> 00:22:58.029
and so an interviewer--an
anthropologist--

00:22:58.029 --> 00:23:01.108
a sociologist--goes in and
starts asking her about it.

00:23:01.108 --> 00:23:04.119
Apparently prior to this little
quote they had brought up the

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:06.630
topic of birth control so the
interviewer says,

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.078
"How did you learn about
condoms?"

00:23:09.078 --> 00:23:13.636
Nina: "One of my customers
said, 'I really hope you don't

00:23:13.636 --> 00:23:16.700
get pregnant,
let him wear a raincoat.'

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.933
So I started wondering,
I'm thinking,

00:23:18.933 --> 00:23:22.532
I'm working and my mind just
can't work out what a raincoat

00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:23.338
is."
 

00:23:23.338 --> 00:23:27.876
Then Mary White who worked for
me said, "Baby what's on

00:23:27.876 --> 00:23:28.798
your mind?
 

00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:33.243
I said, "Mrs. Jacobs
said a funny thing to me,

00:23:33.243 --> 00:23:36.176
she said my ring was
lovely,"

00:23:36.176 --> 00:23:40.201
her marriage ring,
"but she hoped I didn't

00:23:40.201 --> 00:23:43.160
start a family and he should
wear a raincoat.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.308
But I can't ask Johnny to wear
a raincoat to bed."

00:23:46.308 --> 00:23:50.366
This Mary White laughed and
laughed and says,

00:23:50.366 --> 00:23:54.608
"She means he's to wear a
condom."

00:23:54.608 --> 00:23:55.644
"What is it?"
 

00:23:55.644 --> 00:23:56.140
Nina said.
 

00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.042
And then she got told and got
enlightened in this and it's

00:24:00.042 --> 00:24:04.151
that kind of conversation where
individual people of not very

00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:08.191
high class are learning that
it's okay to buck the trend and

00:24:08.191 --> 00:24:12.298
even the basic information they
previously don't have.

00:24:12.298 --> 00:24:14.887
It doesn't always work out
that, when these discussions

00:24:14.887 --> 00:24:17.327
take place,
that the participants do take

00:24:17.327 --> 00:24:22.606
on the new behavior,
sometimes they don't want to do

00:24:22.606 --> 00:24:23.368
that.
 

00:24:23.368 --> 00:24:27.068
Gossip--most conversation by
humans is gossip and there's

00:24:27.068 --> 00:24:29.250
very good studies showing this.
 

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.625
We know that from our chimps
days we're a very social

00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:34.980
species,
that status is so terribly

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.640
important and status translates
to social acceptability,

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.066
so the purpose of gossip is to
find out what the limits of

00:24:42.066 --> 00:24:43.690
social acceptability are.
 

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.730
Gossip is almost exclusively
about someone who has stepped

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:49.984
over what was perceived to be
the limit and either gotten away

00:24:49.984 --> 00:24:52.118
with it or not gotten away with
it,

00:24:52.118 --> 00:24:54.980
or something that's now just
inside the limit.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:58.949
A large fraction of gossip is
to see what is socially

00:24:58.949 --> 00:25:02.136
acceptable in my circle,
and sometimes like we've seen

00:25:02.136 --> 00:25:04.117
here,
the use of condoms becomes

00:25:04.117 --> 00:25:07.930
socially acceptable as a result
of discussions like this.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:15.126
Sometimes it--at least this
individual at this time it

00:25:15.126 --> 00:25:18.930
doesn't become acceptable.
 

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.598
Where is this other quote that
I'm looking for?

00:25:23.598 --> 00:25:26.670
This is another two women,
and the interviewer asks,

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.680
"How did your friends have
abortions?"

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.573
The issue of abortions came up
and as you probably have read or

00:25:32.573 --> 00:25:34.356
will read,
abortions at this time were

00:25:34.356 --> 00:25:37.769
very, very common,
all illegal, but very common.

00:25:37.769 --> 00:25:41.007
"Peggy,
I'm trying to think what they

00:25:41.007 --> 00:25:43.930
would take because they'd tell
me,

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.077
a lot of them would have a
friend who would put something

00:25:47.077 --> 00:25:49.890
up there that would bring on
their period."

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.118
The interviewer,
"A knitting needle?"

00:25:52.118 --> 00:25:53.828
Peggy, "No not a knitting
needle,

00:25:53.828 --> 00:25:57.969
some kind of fluid,
like hot boiling water or salt

00:25:57.969 --> 00:26:00.541
water,
they would ruin their insides,

00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:05.490
they would say,
'Oh Peggy don't you do that.'

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:08.401
Oh no I would never do that,
that's my husband,

00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:10.680
it's the man who takes
care."

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.421
It's interesting that in this
particular case it's usually the

00:26:15.421 --> 00:26:18.528
woman's responsibility in most
cases,

00:26:18.528 --> 00:26:21.355
but in this case whatever was
going on in the marriage she

00:26:21.355 --> 00:26:23.240
perceived it as the husband's
case,

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.809
and in further discussion that
it was his responsibility to use

00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:29.578
a condom all the time.
 

00:26:29.578 --> 00:26:36.420
The reason given by the woman
is not any moral consideration,

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.009
no life--that's not the
consideration,

00:26:40.009 --> 00:26:43.229
but it's a medical thing,
it's just at that time the

00:26:43.229 --> 00:26:46.878
methods since it was illegal,
and if you didn't--even if you

00:26:46.878 --> 00:26:48.890
went to a practitioner it was
very,

00:26:48.890 --> 00:26:51.368
very dangerous but the kinds of
things that women actually used

00:26:51.368 --> 00:26:53.210
on themselves were so incredibly
dangerous,

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.265
so the reason she's not having
an abortion is that she doesn't

00:26:57.265 --> 00:27:00.588
want to ruin herself in the
medical sort of way.

00:27:00.588 --> 00:27:04.108
You take this same woman,
transpose her 50 years later,

00:27:04.108 --> 00:27:07.420
where now abortion is safe and
possibly legal,

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:11.088
this same woman may have a very
different attitude toward,

00:27:11.088 --> 00:27:14.720
but of course we don't know
anything about that.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:21.963
The point of this--series of
stories is a big change in

00:27:21.963 --> 00:27:25.715
culture,
that prior--every society has

00:27:25.715 --> 00:27:30.346
to control population in some
way and we've talked about the

00:27:30.346 --> 00:27:33.732
physical constraints,
the disease and famines,

00:27:33.732 --> 00:27:37.290
we've talked about the social
controls like not being able to

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.384
get married,
but up until--in Europe up

00:27:40.384 --> 00:27:44.759
until very recently there was no
individual control.

00:27:44.759 --> 00:27:48.278
Individuals themselves did not
have the cultural freedom to

00:27:48.278 --> 00:27:50.220
make these kinds of decisions.
 

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.820
Once married,
procreation just keeps going

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:58.827
one after the other until either
someone dies or the woman

00:27:58.827 --> 00:28:00.759
becomes infertile.
 

00:28:00.759 --> 00:28:05.023
Now we're seeing a transition
where individuals can start

00:28:05.023 --> 00:28:08.640
deciding for themselves,
a very big change in the

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.605
extension of agency that what a
person thinks they can control

00:28:12.605 --> 00:28:13.970
about their lives.
 

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:22.482
Here is an elderly Jewish
woman, who was talking about her

00:28:22.482 --> 00:28:31.145
mother and said the way the
neighbors now start controlling

00:28:31.145 --> 00:28:34.489
this,
so the mother who did not use

00:28:34.489 --> 00:28:38.507
any kind of fertility control,
her friends and relatives would

00:28:38.507 --> 00:28:40.740
sort of get on her case but
mild,

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.019
chided her mildly.
 

00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:44.009
When she would get pregnant
they would say,

00:28:44.009 --> 00:28:48.920
'Oh!, Esther not another
belly,' and so at this time

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.237
friends,
relatives, neighbors start

00:28:52.237 --> 00:28:54.930
imposing a new culture on you.
 

00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:00.509
There's some aspects of freedom
that the individual now gets to

00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:05.640
choose but the culture comes on
and now at least starts to

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.058
import a new cultural norm on
you.

00:29:09.058 --> 00:29:13.940
In Sicily, reputed to have very
high,

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.818
actually having high fertility
rates,

00:29:15.818 --> 00:29:20.913
but at some point they go
through their transition and

00:29:20.913 --> 00:29:23.700
this is in 1980--
in the 1980s,

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:28.132
very late, and this is a report
of woman who's one of the few

00:29:28.132 --> 00:29:30.940
remaining peasants in this
village.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:34.429
Sicily, like all the rest of
the world, is changing and

00:29:34.429 --> 00:29:35.269
growing up.
 

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:39.152
She reported that these
families that still had child

00:29:39.152 --> 00:29:43.034
after child, after child,
their neighbors called them

00:29:43.034 --> 00:29:43.930
animals.
 

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:50.779
And this is Sicilian to
Sicilian.

00:29:50.779 --> 00:29:57.019
Here's another example of this,
a Jewish immigrant in the U.S.

00:29:57.019 --> 00:29:59.960
writing to her mother back in
Poland.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.750
This is a lovely letter.
 

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.150
"Here in America,
it is the custom that if a

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:09.188
woman wants to she has a baby,
and if she does not want to

00:30:09.188 --> 00:30:11.028
have any, she doesn't.
 

00:30:11.028 --> 00:30:13.354
David's wife,
I don't know if that's a

00:30:13.354 --> 00:30:16.431
brother or something,
"David's wife says that

00:30:16.431 --> 00:30:19.068
she will have a baby every four
years.

00:30:19.068 --> 00:30:22.015
I think it is good to have one
every three years,

00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:24.960
and so after three years I
shall have another.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.036
It is terrible that at home
women suffer only hardships in

00:30:28.036 --> 00:30:29.170
childbearing."
 

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.140
Home being Poland in this case.
 

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.471
It's really interesting that
the technology is not of

00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:37.279
interest to her.
 

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:40.536
She doesn't--in this case talk
about the wonderful new

00:30:40.536 --> 00:30:44.221
contraceptives that they have in
America which of course they

00:30:44.221 --> 00:30:46.250
would not have had in Poland.
 

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.088
Nor about the availability
of--the knowledge about it,

00:30:49.088 --> 00:30:51.446
the availability of it,
the technology of it,

00:30:51.446 --> 00:30:53.430
she doesn't talk about
economics.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.950
She doesn't say,
'Oh we can't afford it or we

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:58.298
can afford,' any of that sort of
stuff.

00:30:58.298 --> 00:31:01.810
She talks about what to her is
this startling new idea that's

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.773
under her control,
that she can choose herself

00:31:04.773 --> 00:31:07.769
what to do,
and someone else can make a

00:31:07.769 --> 00:31:10.009
different kind of a choice.
 

00:31:10.009 --> 00:31:14.412
What she's exuberant about is
the lack of cultural

00:31:14.412 --> 00:31:17.987
constraints;
she's now a free individual to

00:31:17.987 --> 00:31:21.539
navigate the world as she sees
it in herself.

00:31:37.618 --> 00:31:42.170
Also in all these discussions
men are rarely mentioned,

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:44.858
it really is sort of women's
decision here,

00:31:44.858 --> 00:31:48.980
and the women are working it
out, and again in most of these

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.288
things--
well in a lot of these things

00:31:51.288 --> 00:31:54.237
sometimes it is the man,
'no matter what I say he won't

00:31:54.237 --> 00:31:57.401
stay away from me,' but once the
contraception comes in then men

00:31:57.401 --> 00:32:00.315
want the sex and you get a lot
of conflict if they're using

00:32:00.315 --> 00:32:04.672
contraception,
but once contraception comes in

00:32:04.672 --> 00:32:10.078
it seems to be much easier to
manage the females.

00:32:10.078 --> 00:32:22.778
You have read some of this in
your readings.

00:32:22.778 --> 00:32:27.218
Until the demographic--so now
I'm going to go back to talking

00:32:27.218 --> 00:32:30.233
about marriage--
until the demographic

00:32:30.233 --> 00:32:33.748
revolution as I said,
the marriages rates are

00:32:33.748 --> 00:32:37.230
controlled by the community not
the individual.

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:41.904
Let's look at the marriage
rates here if I can find them

00:32:41.904 --> 00:32:42.839
without--
 

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.058
this is Belgium and various
provinces in Belgium,

00:33:06.058 --> 00:33:10.900
and Belgium as you know is a
totally Catholic country,

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.190
and we will talk a little bit
more about Belgium in a minute.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:20.509
Here are the dates from before
the transition to 1970,

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:22.180
very recent.
 

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:28.338
This is the marital index,
what fraction got married and

00:33:28.338 --> 00:33:33.298
look at that 40%,
only 40% of people got married

00:33:33.298 --> 00:33:36.394
in that year--
that ever married,

00:33:36.394 --> 00:33:41.500
so more than half of people are
not getting married.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.009
We think of the old days as
everybody had to get married.

00:33:45.009 --> 00:33:45.215
No.
 

00:33:45.215 --> 00:33:48.178
As time goes on,
as the fertility transition

00:33:48.178 --> 00:33:52.516
takes place as people are having
fewer and fewer children within

00:33:52.516 --> 00:33:55.672
marriage,
the marriage rate goes up

00:33:55.672 --> 00:34:00.509
drastically until it's 70%,
75%, which is kind of a modern

00:34:00.509 --> 00:34:01.190
rate.
 

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:03.180
The same thing,
this is another set of

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.478
provinces,
another set of provinces,

00:34:05.478 --> 00:34:08.224
there's Antwerp,
the big cities,

00:34:08.224 --> 00:34:13.329
Luxemburg which--a lot of
provinces in Belgium.

00:34:13.329 --> 00:34:19.000
A very interesting thing is
that, again keeping in mind that

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.230
societies have to control their
fertility.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.594
If you're controlling marriage,
if you don't have any mechanism

00:34:26.594 --> 00:34:29.740
of contraception then when
people get married they're going

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:32.509
to have babies boom,
boom, boom, boom so you have to

00:34:32.509 --> 00:34:35.512
control one method,
you have to control the number

00:34:35.512 --> 00:34:39.695
of marriages,
so you control it extremely,

00:34:39.695 --> 00:34:41.510
40% marriages.
 

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.059
In China--we're going to talk
about China later--

00:34:43.059 --> 00:34:47.503
do you know what the rate
of--the Americans complain and

00:34:47.503 --> 00:34:52.351
Chinese too to some degree about
the one child policy and the

00:34:52.351 --> 00:34:55.625
excess of female --
of males--that there aren't

00:34:55.625 --> 00:34:58.402
enough girls to get married and
this is going to cause

00:34:58.402 --> 00:35:00.079
incredible social disruption.
 

00:35:00.079 --> 00:35:04.329
You know what the rate--what
the absence of females is there?

00:35:04.329 --> 00:35:09.097
At maximum like 15% or 18% and
so nothing like--here 60% of

00:35:09.097 --> 00:35:11.730
people aren't getting married.
 

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:16.528
The Chinese situation is still
above--if all the males--if all

00:35:16.528 --> 00:35:20.621
the females get married
something like 85% of men can

00:35:20.621 --> 00:35:21.880
get married.
 

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.885
If you compare China and
Europe, it's again,

00:35:25.885 --> 00:35:31.659
it's not necessarily a reality
based thing this worry about the

00:35:31.659 --> 00:35:33.710
male/female ratio.
 

00:35:41.409 --> 00:35:48.010
This is a map of Europe,
and the whole of Europe

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:54.434
including Russia,
and this is 1870 and it was

00:35:54.434 --> 00:35:57.681
1870 Europe,
this was from the Princeton

00:35:57.681 --> 00:36:00.731
project and every one of these
little things is a province of

00:36:00.731 --> 00:36:02.931
Europe,
and every one these provinces

00:36:02.931 --> 00:36:06.159
they've collected data on
everything under the sun for,

00:36:06.159 --> 00:36:08.780
and this is the marriage rate.
 

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:13.947
Look here, the red is less than
30% and you have an occasional

00:36:13.947 --> 00:36:17.945
place,
northern Scotland,

00:36:17.945 --> 00:36:24.811
I think is--it's not Bulgaria,
Bulgaria is more over here,

00:36:24.811 --> 00:36:27.159
I can't tell from the map but
it's a province in the south

00:36:27.159 --> 00:36:27.489
here.
 

00:36:27.489 --> 00:36:31.329
Look at the red here,
that's under 40% of people are

00:36:31.329 --> 00:36:35.998
getting married and then some of
the lighter stuff you get into

00:36:35.998 --> 00:36:37.429
the 40% to 50%.
 

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:41.009
The same true through middle
Europe: Germany,

00:36:41.009 --> 00:36:43.693
Austria, Switzerland,
Scandinavia,

00:36:43.693 --> 00:36:44.670
Finland.
 

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.391
All through here they're all in
the 50% and less,

00:36:47.391 --> 00:36:50.000
less than 50% of people are
getting married.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.619
1870--a little bit in Spain you
get up into a more reasonable

00:36:54.619 --> 00:36:59.469
range and you have to go all the
way out to the Caspian Sea,

00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:02.340
the border of the Caspian Sea
to find people getting married,

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.394
80% of the people getting
married, a number that we

00:37:05.394 --> 00:37:08.389
consider something sort of
reasonable for our--

00:37:08.389 --> 00:37:11.775
not now because marriage rate
is falling but that was the

00:37:11.775 --> 00:37:14.918
general preconception of
Westerners growing up in our

00:37:14.918 --> 00:37:18.302
society is that from time
immemorial almost everybody got

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:21.210
married,
but it's not the case.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:25.186
The Eastern Europe,
which was in a rather different

00:37:25.186 --> 00:37:27.969
mold, had a higher marriage
rate.

00:37:27.969 --> 00:37:32.878
Now you look at this,
this is 1870 and you come up to

00:37:32.878 --> 00:37:37.786
after the fertility transition
and look what happens,

00:37:37.786 --> 00:37:40.429
everybody's gone bluish.
 

00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:43.688
Marriage has just shot up all
over Europe, including--which is

00:37:43.688 --> 00:37:46.920
actually what you've got left;
these are sort of doing the

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:50.074
reverse, but Western Europe
where we have lots of lots of

00:37:50.074 --> 00:37:53.115
good data and understanding
there's almost nothing pink

00:37:53.115 --> 00:37:53.679
left.
 

00:37:53.679 --> 00:38:01.030
Guess now who has the lowest
marriage rate?

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.610
Ireland.
 

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:05.510
What's special about Ireland at
this time?

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:09.697
Catholic and no contraception
so they're not allowed to get

00:38:09.697 --> 00:38:10.420
married.
 

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:14.206
They're back in the 30%,
40% and that's sort of very

00:38:14.206 --> 00:38:17.550
characteristic of the sociology
of Ireland.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:21.161
That the men are very close to
their mother and get married

00:38:21.161 --> 00:38:24.090
either very late or don't get
married at all.

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.900
Whereas England,
their Protestant neighbor,

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:31.213
sharing all kinds of other
cultural aspects is up there in

00:38:31.213 --> 00:38:36.275
the 70% to 75% of marriage,
so that's one of the really

00:38:36.275 --> 00:38:40.893
amazing kinds of things that
happened that basically the

00:38:40.893 --> 00:38:44.960
spread of marriage;
that in Europe--different story

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.469
in other parts of the world
that--

00:38:47.469 --> 00:38:51.057
because of the need to control
total population in the old days

00:38:51.057 --> 00:38:54.472
people just weren't allowed to
get married because once they

00:38:54.472 --> 00:38:58.119
were in marriage they weren't
allowed to use contraception.

00:38:58.119 --> 00:39:02.739
Once you flip that equation and
open up to individual decision,

00:39:02.739 --> 00:39:05.998
there's no requirement--that in
all of this there's no

00:39:05.998 --> 00:39:09.811
requirement to use contraception
but families naturally want to

00:39:09.811 --> 00:39:13.253
have fewer children then they
would have naturally and so

00:39:13.253 --> 00:39:15.530
fertility in a family declines.
 

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:20.927
The social control of marriage
is not needed anymore and the

00:39:20.927 --> 00:39:24.039
marriage rate goes up very high.
 

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:27.014
Of course along with marriage
that--I call this a

00:39:27.014 --> 00:39:30.298
democratization effect,
marriage gets democratized and

00:39:30.298 --> 00:39:32.530
of course sex gets democratized.
 

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.679
Prior to this,
all these people that aren't

00:39:35.679 --> 00:39:39.668
married either have no sex,
or they have homosexual sex,

00:39:39.668 --> 00:39:42.851
they go to prostitutes,
I mean they--we don't know much

00:39:42.851 --> 00:39:46.010
about how much sex they had but
they had some sort of sex,

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:48.789
and that was what society
demanded of them.

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:52.422
Normal marital sex was not
allowed and a small fraction

00:39:52.422 --> 00:39:55.179
were able to get married and
have sex--

00:39:55.179 --> 00:39:58.556
so along with the
democratization of marriage you

00:39:58.556 --> 00:40:01.230
also get the democratization of
sex.

00:40:08.429 --> 00:40:16.710
Let's look at some of the
details of this happening.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:19.829
While I've got these pictures,
these big maps are hard for the

00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:21.619
computer to calculate
apparently.

00:40:41.389 --> 00:40:46.320
This is some the contraceptives
that were coming at this time.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:48.994
Some of these--there's several
museums in the world that get

00:40:48.994 --> 00:40:51.952
all the contra--
one is just stones,

00:40:51.952 --> 00:40:57.266
putting stones in the--
other sort of various forms of

00:40:57.266 --> 00:41:00.829
blocking the canal to absorb the
semen,

00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:03.829
and you put cotton or something
in a little bag like this,

00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:06.750
put it in the vagina and--these
all helped.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:10.362
This, I don't know exactly what
that is, but again some blocking

00:41:10.362 --> 00:41:13.516
substance, then they could be
made not only of vegetable

00:41:13.516 --> 00:41:14.949
matter, but of metal.
 

00:41:14.949 --> 00:41:20.003
There's a whole bunch of things
called pessaries where the

00:41:20.003 --> 00:41:25.324
cap--a cap made out of porcelain
or something is put over the

00:41:25.324 --> 00:41:26.300
cervix.
 

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:29.969
There are--this is a variety of
condoms,

00:41:29.969 --> 00:41:33.550
including some fairly modern
ones, but the older ones--

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:37.003
this is an old way they were
made--older ones looked like

00:41:37.003 --> 00:41:42.009
this and what do you think was--
how they originally made

00:41:42.009 --> 00:41:43.099
condoms?
 

00:41:43.099 --> 00:41:47.329
The technology was borrowed
from something else.

00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:53.101
What else comes very commonly
purchased item come--sausages,

00:41:53.101 --> 00:41:54.079
exactly.
 

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:58.735
What was--before there was
plastics what was sausage casing

00:41:58.735 --> 00:41:59.860
made out of?
 

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:03.250
Intestines, animal intestines,
they can be made very thin

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.579
because they're just a small
barrier for absorption,

00:42:06.579 --> 00:42:10.960
very thin and so they were
called skins and I don't know

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:16.318
which of these things are which,
but that was not a very

00:42:16.318 --> 00:42:21.679
difficult technology to make
them out of skins.

00:42:21.679 --> 00:42:25.853
Here are some more modern
things, various kinds of IUDs,

00:42:25.853 --> 00:42:29.875
everything under the sun was
tried, including the more

00:42:29.875 --> 00:42:30.710
modern.
 

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.920
This is a very ancient
technique.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.217
People at different times have
believed that almost anything

00:42:46.217 --> 00:42:49.326
works as a contraceptive,
this is a bone on a string,

00:42:49.326 --> 00:42:52.268
again placed inside,
and heaven knows what the

00:42:52.268 --> 00:42:53.929
theory was why that would work.
 

00:42:53.929 --> 00:42:57.690
It might have just prevented
the man from entering far enough

00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.320
or something,
who knows.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:04.393
The string, like a modern IUD,
whereas a string hangs out and

00:43:04.393 --> 00:43:06.340
you can pull it down.
 

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.909
One of the problems with modern
IUDs until recently,

00:43:09.909 --> 00:43:13.900
and the same problem here,
you have a string and what does

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.159
the string do?
 

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:20.027
It's a route for bacteria to
swim up so the strings are

00:43:20.027 --> 00:43:21.739
dangerous things.
 

00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:26.400
Let me get back to the
beginning of this a little bit.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.907
Now we've talked about
individuals sort of in a variety

00:43:47.907 --> 00:43:50.809
of ways how this happened to
individuals and cultural things.

00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:54.039
Here--you didn't--this wasn't
in your reading this particular

00:43:54.039 --> 00:43:54.469
graph.
 

00:43:54.469 --> 00:43:57.030
So here is a graph of the date,
again Europe,

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.260
the different countries of
Europe and when--

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.246
within marriage what their rate
of fertility was within

00:44:03.246 --> 00:44:06.389
marriage,
with actually 1.0 being the

00:44:06.389 --> 00:44:11.257
Hutterite level which is the
maximum level people have

00:44:11.257 --> 00:44:12.360
achieved.
 

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.739
What do you make out of that?
 

00:44:16.739 --> 00:44:18.690
It's kind of a mess, right?
 

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:22.856
You can see something,
you can see France being lower

00:44:22.856 --> 00:44:26.463
already by 1860,
we know it had its transition

00:44:26.463 --> 00:44:29.590
and you can't really see much
else.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:33.869
One of the data that you read
about,

00:44:33.869 --> 00:44:39.556
if you take those same graphs
and now change their time thing

00:44:39.556 --> 00:44:42.827
and ask,
well let's gather each graph at

00:44:42.827 --> 00:44:45.318
the point--
there's a traditional level of

00:44:45.318 --> 00:44:47.168
fertility,
eight or so children,

00:44:47.168 --> 00:44:50.425
and in each country it may be a
little different somewhere

00:44:50.425 --> 00:44:53.744
between six and eight,
and then at some point it

00:44:53.744 --> 00:44:57.855
starts to drop and when it's
dropped by 10% is a critical

00:44:57.855 --> 00:45:00.362
stage,
so the Princeton people argued,

00:45:00.362 --> 00:45:03.755
and so they've gathered--
this is the years after

00:45:03.755 --> 00:45:07.454
reaching the 90%,
so at this point in time all of

00:45:07.454 --> 00:45:09.510
these countries have dropped.
 

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:15.853
These curves are gathered to
put together the point where

00:45:15.853 --> 00:45:21.969
they reach 10% drop from their
pre-transition level.

00:45:21.969 --> 00:45:23.579
Then it makes more sense.
 

00:45:23.579 --> 00:45:27.998
Look at the way it falls down
like crazy until it hits some

00:45:27.998 --> 00:45:32.798
sort of roughly a new plateau at
about half or so of the earlier

00:45:32.798 --> 00:45:36.469
plateau,
a little bit less than half.

00:45:36.469 --> 00:45:40.583
The amount of time here,
this is zero years and it's all

00:45:40.583 --> 00:45:44.635
over maybe in 50 years,
and if you look at any one

00:45:44.635 --> 00:45:48.199
place it's a much shorter period
than that.

00:45:48.199 --> 00:45:51.820
Within a very--what Princeton
decided a couple of things.

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:55.530
One that's hard to figure out
but there was,

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.184
for some reason,
various groups started their

00:45:58.184 --> 00:46:02.230
fertility decline and we'll talk
about various theories of that,

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.402
but once it became--whereas
everyone else was horrified

00:46:05.402 --> 00:46:08.083
about whatever they say,
it was rich people,

00:46:08.083 --> 00:46:09.409
it was outcast people.
 

00:46:09.409 --> 00:46:13.246
How did in--so it was upper
class--the fertility decline

00:46:13.246 --> 00:46:15.760
happened first among upper
class,

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.090
among city class,
among Jews, and so it's always

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:25.436
some sort of a non-majority
social group that starts social

00:46:25.436 --> 00:46:26.449
change.
 

00:46:26.449 --> 00:46:31.219
What made the discussion of
condoms legitimate?

00:46:31.219 --> 00:46:33.420
In America when I was in--you
could not mention condom,

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.025
no television discussion of it,
news reports never mentioned

00:46:36.025 --> 00:46:38.869
it,
and what is it that allowed

00:46:38.869 --> 00:46:42.309
condoms to be discussed in
America?

00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:50.443
You know--AIDS epidemic,
and where did the AIDS epidemic

00:46:50.443 --> 00:46:52.070
start in?
 

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.922
Homosexuals,
so a marginalized group starts

00:46:54.922 --> 00:46:57.710
something, it spreads into the
culture.

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.820
Where do our clothing fashions
often come from?

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:04.079
From the poorest kids often,
I can see--

00:47:04.079 --> 00:47:07.043
go into the ghetto and see what
the kids are wearing and six

00:47:07.043 --> 00:47:09.855
years later you guys are going
to be wearing exactly what

00:47:09.855 --> 00:47:13.514
they're wearing,
long baggy pants and so forth

00:47:13.514 --> 00:47:15.940
and showing various parts.
 

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.873
The idea is one,
that something happens up here

00:47:18.873 --> 00:47:22.766
and there's a lot of discussion
about that but once it becomes

00:47:22.766 --> 00:47:25.681
socially--
the idea is that once it

00:47:25.681 --> 00:47:29.039
reaches that 10% level,
it just falls down,

00:47:29.039 --> 00:47:31.670
fertility just falls down like
a stone.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:37.615
In this period,
up here you can get all kinds

00:47:37.615 --> 00:47:41.985
of economic levels,
that different economic groups

00:47:41.985 --> 00:47:45.695
are having different fertility,
different educational groups,

00:47:45.695 --> 00:47:48.469
difference between urban and
rural,

00:47:48.469 --> 00:47:51.489
difference in whether they're
agricultural or in an industry,

00:47:51.489 --> 00:47:53.710
and you can find all these
differences,

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.150
but once this fertility thing
starts like this,

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:59.469
everybody does it.
 

00:47:59.469 --> 00:48:00.920
What they call these
differentials,

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.965
these socio economic
differentials just disappear and

00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:09.556
a farmer is just as likely to be
limiting his fertility as a

00:48:09.556 --> 00:48:12.280
bourgeois person in the cities.
 

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:24.188
If you try to think of how
rapidly the economic situation

00:48:24.188 --> 00:48:26.489
changes,
or how rapidly does education

00:48:26.489 --> 00:48:29.769
increase,
and you look at all the various

00:48:29.769 --> 00:48:32.344
variables,
none of them increase with this

00:48:32.344 --> 00:48:34.284
kind of rapidity,
none of them change with that

00:48:34.284 --> 00:48:35.670
kind of ability,
infant mortality,

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.190
almost anything you can
measure,

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:43.579
nothing goes with that kind of
a rate.

00:48:43.579 --> 00:48:52.090
What goes with that kind of a
rate?

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:53.210
A fad, a fashion.
 

00:49:11.039 --> 00:49:14.594
If you look all around Europe,
and this was in your reading,

00:49:14.594 --> 00:49:18.090
what you see is the date of the
beginning of the decade.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:24.690
This is the decade where that
10% level was reached and what

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:27.039
provinces are this?
 

00:49:27.039 --> 00:49:28.050
This is all France.
 

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:31.010
Then there's a long delay,
a surprisingly long delay,

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:35.920
and boom all the rest of Europe
then does it in basically--

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.679
most of it's done between 1870
and 1930,

00:49:40.679 --> 00:49:42.010
it's almost all done.
 

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.235
This just sweeps through
Europe, and again as I've showed

00:49:44.235 --> 00:49:46.081
you on the maps,
it includes Russia,

00:49:46.081 --> 00:49:49.358
Eastern Europe,
economically and educationally

00:49:49.358 --> 00:49:52.268
very underdeveloped kinds of
places,

00:49:52.268 --> 00:49:56.469
and yet the fertility drops,
this is all of Europe,

00:49:56.469 --> 00:49:58.139
nobody is left out.
 

00:49:58.139 --> 00:50:04.740
Again, it makes it difficult to
put an economic or an

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:11.090
educational, any of these other
variables on it.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:15.221
What you have instead is,
and one of these stories you

00:50:15.221 --> 00:50:19.137
read about in your reading--
remember that each of these

00:50:19.137 --> 00:50:22.699
graduate students and post docs
was put on a different country

00:50:22.699 --> 00:50:24.920
of Europe in the Princeton
project.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:27.239
One had to do England,
one had to do--

00:50:27.239 --> 00:50:29.561
and have the who did England is
going to be guest lecturer here

00:50:29.561 --> 00:50:30.849
next week,
next Thursday,

00:50:30.849 --> 00:50:34.045
he's not going to talk about
that because you'll have had

00:50:34.045 --> 00:50:35.530
enough of that by then.
 

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:39.110
There was a guy who was
assigned Spain;

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:43.449
this guy is William Leisure,
and this I think you read a

00:50:43.449 --> 00:50:44.949
little bit about.
 

00:50:44.949 --> 00:50:48.291
He gathered all this data,
a huge amount of work in all

00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:52.005
the Spanish archives of every
province from going way back to

00:50:52.005 --> 00:50:54.833
1830 or something,
whatever was there,

00:50:54.833 --> 00:50:55.869
he looked at.
 

00:50:55.869 --> 00:51:00.079
And he put it all together and
he could not make any sense out

00:51:00.079 --> 00:51:01.389
of it whatsoever.
 

00:51:01.389 --> 00:51:05.360
This guy was going out of his
mind and he took to drawing a

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.126
map of fertility rates,
sort of like those kinds of

00:51:08.126 --> 00:51:11.353
maps I just showed you,
fertility rates at different

00:51:11.353 --> 00:51:15.650
points in time in the different
provinces of Spain.

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:18.900
He showed it to everybody and
apparently he was walking around

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.992
campus one day and he saw a
professor of Spanish Literature

00:51:21.992 --> 00:51:25.297
who he had met somewhere and he
said he buttonholed the guy and

00:51:25.297 --> 00:51:27.429
showed him these graphs and
said,

00:51:27.429 --> 00:51:30.766
'I can't make any sense out of
this,' and he told the professor

00:51:30.766 --> 00:51:31.518
what it was.
 

00:51:31.518 --> 00:51:34.740
The professor said,
'That's the linguistic regions

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:35.530
of Spain.'
 

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:39.789
As you know Spain had a variety
of kingdoms,

00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:43.900
they were controlled by the
Muslims,

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.929
and then the Northern
Christians kicked them out,

00:51:46.929 --> 00:51:51.284
but there's Castille and
Navarra, and Aragon and all of

00:51:51.284 --> 00:51:53.219
these cultural things.
 

00:51:53.219 --> 00:51:55.869
And still the Basques consider
themselves quite separate,

00:51:55.869 --> 00:51:58.239
the Catalans consider
themselves separate,

00:51:58.239 --> 00:52:02.199
so Spain, to this day,
has serious regional

00:52:02.199 --> 00:52:03.518
diversities.
 

00:52:03.518 --> 00:52:08.460
What apparently Leisure had
come up with unknowingly was a

00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:13.748
map of the linguistic boundaries
of ancient medieval Spain and

00:52:13.748 --> 00:52:15.829
they still remained.
 

00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:18.719
The idea that he came up with,
as well as is fairly obvious,

00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:20.630
is that people that could speak
the same language,

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:23.365
the same dialect,
were of the common culture

00:52:23.365 --> 00:52:27.056
would talk to each other and
that it was social spread what

00:52:27.056 --> 00:52:30.871
kept the province,
a linguistic region uniform in

00:52:30.871 --> 00:52:34.789
its fertility practices was the
cultural spread,

00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:38.905
but that was the cultural unit
as well as the linguistic unit

00:52:38.905 --> 00:52:41.170
and it didn't cross boundaries.
 

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.800
Another more quantified example
of that is Belgium and here is

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.130
Belgium, in Belgium they speak
two languages which are?

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.804
French and Flemish,
and Flemish is almost the same

00:52:53.804 --> 00:52:54.179
as?
 

00:52:54.179 --> 00:52:56.440
Dutch, which is almost the same
as?

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.391
German, so it's a big divide,
it's a Germanic/Romance

00:53:00.391 --> 00:53:01.760
language divide.
 

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:06.786
This is a big language divide
and in Belgium here are the

00:53:06.786 --> 00:53:11.135
various provinces of Belgium,
and these are the southern ones

00:53:11.135 --> 00:53:13.059
near--
France is over here--so these

00:53:13.059 --> 00:53:15.800
are all French speaking and
Holland is up there,

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:19.592
and Germany is over here--these
are the Flemish speaking

00:53:19.592 --> 00:53:20.420
provinces.
 

00:53:23.989 --> 00:53:32.909
When you look at their
fertility what happens is that--

00:53:46.619 --> 00:53:49.409
when you look at their
fertility France is,

00:53:49.409 --> 00:53:52.199
as you've heard 100 times,
starts the fertility

00:53:52.199 --> 00:53:54.789
transition,
fertility drops there.

00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:58.829
It goes--it takes a fair amount
of time but it goes first into

00:53:58.829 --> 00:54:02.471
French speaking Belgium and
French speaking Belgium then

00:54:02.471 --> 00:54:04.590
conforms to the French norm.
 

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:09.831
Then there's this language line
and you compare across that line

00:54:09.831 --> 00:54:14.907
and nothing north of the line
changes and it takes 60 years to

00:54:14.907 --> 00:54:18.820
cross that language line that I
showed you.

00:54:37.239 --> 00:54:40.900
It takes 60 takes to cross the
language barrier.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:44.268
This guy Lesthaeghe,
the guy who studied--

00:54:44.268 --> 00:54:47.989
who was assigned to Belgium,
and he is Belgian himself,

00:54:47.989 --> 00:54:49.539
he said well what could be
causing it,

00:54:49.539 --> 00:54:53.510
what are the differences
between north/south aside from

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:54.320
language?
 

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:56.679
When he was doing it they
didn't really come up with

00:54:56.679 --> 00:54:58.090
this--
when he was originally--when he

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:00.628
started it they didn't--
hadn't understood this cultural

00:55:00.628 --> 00:55:03.860
difference and so he's looking
at socioeconomic variables.

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:08.199
And so he took villages across
that boundary line there,

00:55:08.199 --> 00:55:10.768
and you take no more than five
kilometers difference and he

00:55:10.768 --> 00:55:13.338
would take villages that were
matched: the soil was kind of

00:55:13.338 --> 00:55:15.534
the same,
the agricultural productivity

00:55:15.534 --> 00:55:18.762
was the same,
and every kind of socioeconomic

00:55:18.762 --> 00:55:23.512
variable that he could find was
not different across that line

00:55:23.512 --> 00:55:25.070
except fertility.
 

00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:29.447
That the northern line just had
an awful lot more children then

00:55:29.447 --> 00:55:32.414
south of the line,
French speaking Flemish

00:55:32.414 --> 00:55:35.255
speaking and presumably
eliminating all these

00:55:35.255 --> 00:55:38.675
socioeconomic variables by
comparing these neighboring

00:55:38.675 --> 00:55:41.840
towns all across Belgium from
east to west,

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:46.782
all across this line he looked
at these kinds of paired

00:55:46.782 --> 00:55:47.789
villages.
 

00:55:47.789 --> 00:55:49.420
Well he said what was doing it?
 

00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:55.710
Well there's--so they started
thinking about cultural reasons,

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.190
and at that time in Europe
there were two--

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:01.775
democracy was still
fairly--real democracy was still

00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:06.204
fairly young but most everybody
had the vote and there was a lot

00:56:06.204 --> 00:56:09.929
of discussion about who would
control democracy,

00:56:09.929 --> 00:56:11.980
whether democracy was a good or
bad thing,

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.329
so the suffrage,
the expanded kind of suffrage,

00:56:15.329 --> 00:56:18.967
they still had kings and all
that, but the power was being

00:56:18.967 --> 00:56:22.668
eroded by parliaments and there
were two sets of parties as

00:56:22.668 --> 00:56:25.030
really there still are in
Europe.

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:29.429
One was the Catholic party,
the conservative party called--

00:56:29.429 --> 00:56:33.311
the other was the socialist
party's or the communist

00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:38.389
party's,
and anybody know what they're

00:56:38.389 --> 00:56:39.559
called?
 

00:56:39.559 --> 00:56:43.106
The Social Democrats and there
are a variety of names other

00:56:43.106 --> 00:56:45.353
parties--
the Christian Demo--the parties

00:56:45.353 --> 00:56:48.550
that are still named Christian
Democrats and Social Democrats.

00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:54.159
Like in Germany they pass the
premiership back and forth

00:56:54.159 --> 00:56:55.690
between them.
 

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.438
That was established at this
time and it was considered a

00:56:59.438 --> 00:57:03.320
fairly good marker for what we
call secularization that how

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:07.268
much a person was still
believing in the old morality,

00:57:07.268 --> 00:57:09.869
the old styled things was
religious,

00:57:09.869 --> 00:57:13.409
they would usually vote for the
Christian democrats.

00:57:13.409 --> 00:57:17.041
People that had undergone some
sort of a transition and now

00:57:17.041 --> 00:57:20.800
were buying socialist theory or
worker solidarity theory,

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:27.056
or believed in unions would
vote the Democratic Socialist

00:57:27.056 --> 00:57:27.949
party.
 

00:57:27.949 --> 00:57:31.369
What he did,
he said, 'okay let's look at

00:57:31.369 --> 00:57:36.414
each of the provinces again,
this is a smaller grouping then

00:57:36.414 --> 00:57:39.920
province and see what their vote
is.'

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.904
There's the Catholic party,
and this is the percentage of

00:57:43.904 --> 00:57:47.309
non-Catholic party,
and then he just compared this

00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:50.070
with how much their fertility
had declined,

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.360
again, always within marriage.
 

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:56.534
It turns out the more
non-Catholic they are the

00:57:56.534 --> 00:57:59.710
greater the decline in
fertility.

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:04.092
It's kind of a backwards thing,
and very nice line of

00:58:04.092 --> 00:58:05.610
proportionality.
 

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.072
This is an exact
proportionality and the points

00:58:08.072 --> 00:58:10.159
stick really very close to that
line;

00:58:10.159 --> 00:58:13.150
it's not hard to see what that
line is,

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:17.268
and so people--what became
clear is that culturally people

00:58:17.268 --> 00:58:21.025
that were voting for the
Catholic party and therefore

00:58:21.025 --> 00:58:24.710
were in the older mode of
culture did not drop their

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:26.590
fertility very much.
 

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:30.369
People who were voting the
socialist,

00:58:30.369 --> 00:58:31.438
the left wing,
liberal whatever you want to

00:58:31.438 --> 00:58:34.405
call it,
had dropped their fertility by

00:58:34.405 --> 00:58:45.079
60% to 80%,
a huge drop in fertility.

00:58:45.079 --> 00:58:54.670
All right, these kinds of data
kept coming up.

00:58:54.670 --> 00:59:01.746
To conclude--the bottom line is
that in this Princeton project

00:59:01.746 --> 00:59:07.896
they just could not tie
fertility change to any of the

00:59:07.896 --> 00:59:12.190
standard socioeconomic
variables.

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:14.960
Now the word socioeconomic,
I think, is a terrible word.

00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:17.949
What is not either socio or
economic?

00:59:17.949 --> 00:59:21.123
I always go around and ask
people descriptions of it and I

00:59:21.123 --> 00:59:24.130
think it basically means
anything you can quantify,

00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:26.876
and you get interesting
variables like education and

00:59:26.876 --> 00:59:29.730
we'll see this sort of
disastrously from understanding

00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:32.530
the situation when we come into
the third world.

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:36.090
Education suits you for a
better job,

00:59:36.090 --> 00:59:38.090
especially women,
so when people get educated

00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:40.411
it's an economic variable
because it suits you for a

00:59:40.411 --> 00:59:42.222
better job,
you can get higher pay,

00:59:42.222 --> 00:59:44.860
it makes it more worth your
while to go out and work than

00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.320
stay home and have children.
 

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.286
But, education also gives you a
window on the world and makes

00:59:50.286 --> 00:59:53.654
you more open to new ideas,
a greater sense of agency that

00:59:53.654 --> 00:59:56.329
you can talk back to your
husband or your mother-in-law,

00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:58.500
and so forth,
so a lot of the variables--

00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:01.851
you can't decide is this an
economic variable or a social

01:00:01.851 --> 01:00:02.510
variable?
 

01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:07.014
It's very unfortunate that they
use this term socioeconomic

01:00:07.014 --> 01:00:07.869
variable.
 

01:00:07.869 --> 01:00:11.878
But, I think it was early stage
in understanding the problem and

01:00:11.878 --> 01:00:14.360
they didn't know what to do
about it.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.405
Also another problem,
it's always in the social

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:20.119
sciences when you try to do
these studies,

01:00:20.119 --> 01:00:23.630
getting the data itself is
really very difficult.

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:26.735
Since Europe is organized
politically into provinces

01:00:26.735 --> 01:00:29.719
that's where the data was
gathered and that's--

01:00:29.719 --> 01:00:33.253
they had province level things,
they didn't have individual

01:00:33.253 --> 01:00:36.820
village level information,
they didn't have individual

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.690
family kind of information.
 

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:42.440
When you do an aggregation,
even as finely as they could

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.472
do,
I mean it's amazing to do every

01:00:44.472 --> 01:00:46.619
province in Europe so that was
for the--

01:00:46.619 --> 01:00:50.461
for that period of social
science that was the low level

01:00:50.461 --> 01:00:53.934
of aggregation,
but still within each province

01:00:53.934 --> 01:00:58.809
you have a huge range of people
in very different circumstances,

01:00:58.809 --> 01:01:02.409
and maybe you're missing a lot
by this aggregation,

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:05.070
so aggregation is a problem.
 

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:08.545
Since this period a lot of
social science scholars have

01:01:08.545 --> 01:01:11.507
come back and argued
tremendously over this and

01:01:11.507 --> 01:01:14.623
saying,
'no there really are economic

01:01:14.623 --> 01:01:19.635
reasons for fertility decline,'
and we'll talk about those in a

01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:21.010
later lecture.
 

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.711
I just want to summarize--we
spent a lot of time on this

01:01:24.711 --> 01:01:27.539
demographic transition and it's
theory,

01:01:27.539 --> 01:01:30.119
and a lot of reading--and every
year students say,

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:33.762
'oh I hated that part of the
course,' but it is in a sense

01:01:33.762 --> 01:01:35.543
the most--
for the modern times it's the

01:01:35.543 --> 01:01:37.500
most important part of the
course because everything else

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.824
that you read,
every understanding of the

01:01:39.824 --> 01:01:43.411
what's happening now in
developing countries is based on

01:01:43.411 --> 01:01:45.463
this stuff,
either agrees with it or

01:01:45.463 --> 01:01:47.807
disagrees with it,
or uses the same methodology or

01:01:47.807 --> 01:01:50.659
very self consciously tries to
use a different methodology,

01:01:50.659 --> 01:01:52.340
this is the foundation of the
fields.

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.920
That's one reason you should
know about it.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:57.893
The other is it's such a
tremendous change,

01:01:57.893 --> 01:02:01.009
it may be to my mind,
it's the most important

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:03.630
revolution ever in human
history.

01:02:03.630 --> 01:02:06.230
Look what happens throughout
this period.

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:09.753
Life, people get to live three
times as long,

01:02:09.753 --> 01:02:14.239
imagine if you're at 20,
how many of you are under 20?

01:02:14.239 --> 01:02:17.891
Okay, half of you would be
dead, half of this class would

01:02:17.891 --> 01:02:21.282
be dead if we weren't--if we
hadn't gone through this

01:02:21.282 --> 01:02:23.369
transition of modernization.
 

01:02:23.369 --> 01:02:25.369
He's happy about that.
 

01:02:25.369 --> 01:02:28.349
The numbers of human beings,
the number of people that we

01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:31.010
now are able to keep alive is
ten times larger,

01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:33.840
everyday it gets bigger,
but last time I counted ten

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.340
times larger than what we think
the population was back then.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.596
So an enormous--even though
it's the introduction of

01:02:40.596 --> 01:02:44.300
contraception which limits the
amount of people or tries to

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.280
limit the amount of people.
 

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:50.219
In fact, the number of people
on earth has just expanded

01:02:50.219 --> 01:02:54.590
enormously, both in numbers and
in how long each one lives.

01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:56.300
Wealth, individual per capita
wealth,

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.914
we saw that the industrial
revolution by itself got into

01:02:59.914 --> 01:03:04.579
Malthusian problems and didn't,
at least up until the fertility

01:03:04.579 --> 01:03:07.909
transition,
did not improve people's

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:09.739
individual wealth.
 

01:03:09.739 --> 01:03:13.507
That required the combination
of industrial revolution which

01:03:13.507 --> 01:03:16.893
increased production and
fertility control which put a

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:20.534
limit on the number of people
trying to get advantage from

01:03:20.534 --> 01:03:22.579
that increased production.
 

01:03:22.579 --> 01:03:25.340
We've seen a tremendous
democratization of marriage.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:29.411
Imagine a society where 30%
of--70% of the people are

01:03:29.411 --> 01:03:31.864
unmarried,
we sort of talk a lot about

01:03:31.864 --> 01:03:35.000
marriage and how marriage is
going away as an institution.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:36.469
We're way, way ahead of that.
 

01:03:36.469 --> 01:03:41.039
China is way ahead of that and
so imagine there was that--

01:03:41.039 --> 01:03:44.063
very few of you would have
prospects of ever getting

01:03:44.063 --> 01:03:47.619
married because society just
didn't allow it and the same for

01:03:47.619 --> 01:03:52.289
sex as I've mentioned,
the democratization of sex.

01:03:52.289 --> 01:03:54.960
Your fertility coming under
your individual control,

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.838
what a big change in life,
that you, now it's one of the

01:03:57.838 --> 01:03:59.409
big decision you can make.
 

01:03:59.409 --> 01:04:01.875
Do I want some children,
many children,

01:04:01.875 --> 01:04:04.860
few children,
whatever, when do I want them?

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.809
All this comes under control.
 

01:04:07.809 --> 01:04:10.556
Within marriage,
previously couples were

01:04:10.556 --> 01:04:14.639
constantly under the pressure of
constant childbearing,

01:04:14.639 --> 01:04:17.199
that the wife was always either
pregnant or lactating.

01:04:17.199 --> 01:04:20.887
Later I'll show you some
statistics from the third world

01:04:20.887 --> 01:04:24.510
that women are almost never
free, they're always either

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:27.260
pregnant or lactating until they
die.

01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:30.755
Men had to go out--this is a
period when men were basically

01:04:30.755 --> 01:04:31.900
the breadwinners.
 

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:35.420
They had to support an ever
increasing number of children

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:38.000
under difficult economic
circumstances.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.929
So men and women were freed
from the requirement--

01:04:40.929 --> 01:04:43.840
they had no choice--the
requirement of supporting,

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:46.889
taking care of and supporting
these large families.

01:04:46.889 --> 01:04:51.630
There's so many issues that
changed during this time.

01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:55.110
If you--if any of you are
thinking of doing term papers

01:04:55.110 --> 01:04:58.914
there's just an infinite number
of things that have not even

01:04:58.914 --> 01:05:00.139
been looked at.
 

01:05:00.139 --> 01:05:02.612
For instance,
we talked a lot about

01:05:02.612 --> 01:05:05.449
abandonment of children,
infanticide.

01:05:05.449 --> 01:05:08.570
When do you think that
disappeared?

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:11.949
Something in about this time;
you read about it into the

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:14.130
1800s there was a lot of it and
then it goes away.

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:17.903
There's a lot written about the
period when it was heavy and not

01:05:17.903 --> 01:05:21.139
much understanding of why did
infanticide disappear.

01:05:21.139 --> 01:05:22.519
Was it due to this?
 

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:25.583
I don't know the answer;
I don't think it has been

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:27.626
discovered;
investigated,

01:05:27.626 --> 01:05:29.039
a great term paper.
 

01:05:29.039 --> 01:05:32.349
What about the romantic
conception of marriage?

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:35.077
When marriage changes like this
it becomes less of an economic

01:05:35.077 --> 01:05:36.766
thing,
less of a childbearing thing,

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.320
you don't need your wife to
work,

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.590
especially on the farm.
 

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:45.322
What is the tie in between
romantic conceptions that we all

01:05:45.322 --> 01:05:49.121
now have about marriage and love
and all that and this whole

01:05:49.121 --> 01:05:50.860
demographic transition?
 

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.110
In almost every way you can
think of modern culture,

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:58.777
this is at the root of it,
that this is a thing that you

01:05:58.777 --> 01:06:02.179
always have to consider as
whatever you believe,

01:06:02.179 --> 01:06:05.367
however you're leading your
life, how much of it is due to

01:06:05.367 --> 01:06:08.833
these pioneers that we've talked
about that started controlling

01:06:08.833 --> 01:06:12.021
their fertility as an individual
decision rather than as a

01:06:12.021 --> 01:06:13.420
community decision?
 

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:17.335
Okay, there's no reading for
today because the lecture is now

01:06:17.335 --> 01:06:20.911
caught up for the reading,
so next week we'll talk on

01:06:20.911 --> 01:06:24.469
Tuesday and then on Thursday we
have a guest lecturer.

01:06:24.469 --> 01:06:26.639
The schedule changed from what
you have.

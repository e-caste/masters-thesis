00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.733
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: We're
coming to the final

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.633
section of The Sound
and the Fury.

00:00:04.633 --> 00:00:08.867
And I think a question that
would have to arise for

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:13.167
everyone is why isn't Caddy the
person to be telling the

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:15.367
story in section four?

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:18.067
It seems logical.

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:23.033
Each of her three brothers gets
to tell the story in one

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:27.033
section, so it would seem
logical that Caddy should be

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.567
the narrator in section four.

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:33.267
This is not a choice that
Faulkner makes, so we have to

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:36.167
think about why he decides
against using

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:38.600
Caddy as the narrator.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.533
So I can just say that to us,
it might seem as if it would

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:47.933
be good to have a woman's voice
in that last section.

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.300
If the missing point of view has
been missing so far, how

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.033
it feels to be Caddy, it
certainly would have restored

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.267
a more balanced gender
dynamics to The

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:00.767
Sound and the Fury.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:06.500
So I think that those are the
reasons that one would argue

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.667
for having Caddy as
the narrator.

00:01:09.667 --> 00:01:12.667
And I would encourage you to
think about that in your

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.733
section, to have a discussion
on this point, whether you

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:18.900
would prefer to have Caddy
as a narrator.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.767
But in today's lecture, I'd
like to explore Faulkner's

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:29.167
reasons for deciding against
having Caddy as a narrator and

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:34.133
the choice that he does make,
which is to have not a

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:38.333
first-person singular, not an
"I" telling the story in

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:43.600
section four, but instead to
have omniscient narration told

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.633
from an outside point of view.

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:50.333
And I would argue that this
narrative choice on Faulkner's

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:56.000
part is also mapped onto a
thematic emphasis on a

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.467
collectivity, on a
communal voice.

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:03.900
So it's not one person's point
of view, but instead really a

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.733
group of people, their
interrelations and what

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:11.267
emerges from that
collectivity.

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:14.433
In thinking about these
questions, I think it's useful

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:18.100
to go back a little bit to the
publication history of The

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.733
Sound and the Fury.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:23.933
As you guys know, the first
edition came out in 1929, the

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:26.867
same year as the crash,
as we saw last time.

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:33.400
And in 1946, Random House
decided to bring out The

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.300
Portable Faulker, edited by a
very important author and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.567
critic, Malcolm Cowley,
who was also

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:47.233
a big fan of Faulkner.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.333
So Malcolm Cowley was just
editing this Portable

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:54.000
Faulkner, which turned out to be
a very successful edition.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.733
It was used a lot.

00:02:55.733 --> 00:03:00.733
And this is the 1946 edition
of The Portable Faulkner.

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:04.900
It really announces the
importance of Faulkner.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.700
He's the kind of author about
whom you would have a portable

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.367
something edition.

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:13.200
So it was a great thing
for Faulkner.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.033
And in preparation for The
Portable Faulkner, he decided

00:03:18.033 --> 00:03:22.433
to write an appendix to The
Sound and the Fury to be

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:25.633
included in The Portable
Faulkner.

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:30.800
And this is what he said to
Malcolm Cowley before it came

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.733
out, October 1945, about
the appendix.

00:03:36.733 --> 00:03:40.067
"I should have done this
when I wrote the book.

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:44.267
Then the whole thing would have
fallen into pattern like

00:03:44.267 --> 00:03:48.400
a jigsaw puzzle when the
magician's wand touched it."

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.233
So that's the degree of
importance that he would

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:57.567
attach to the appendix, although
it seems-- he was

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:02.967
writing in 1945, almost 20 years
after the original The

00:04:02.967 --> 00:04:04.567
Sound and the Fury--

00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:10.067
he had a somewhat changed
idea about the novel.

00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:14.200
His recollection of the novel
seemed a bit skewed, even to

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.467
Malcolm Cowley.

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:19.133
So Cowley wrote back to him,
even made Xeroxes of the

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.167
original The Sound and the Fury
just to remind him what

00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:27.033
was in the original novel and
asked if he would consider

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.800
revising the appendix a little
bit in light of what he'd

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.600
actually written in The
Sound and the Fury.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.867
But Faulkner wouldn't
have any of that.

00:04:33.867 --> 00:04:35.700
He would stick to
his appendix.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.433
And not only that, the same
year, Random House decided to

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:42.667
bring out a dual edition of The
Sound and the Fury and As

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:43.700
I Lay Dying.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.267
We'll be reading As I Lay Dying
a little bit later on.

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:50.800
In 1946, those two were brought
out in a single dual

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.967
edition under the Modern Library
imprint, which is a

00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:59.400
cheaper paperback edition
of Random House Books.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.500
So it came out in the Modern
Library edition.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.433
And in preparation for that,
Faulkner was also very

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:09.367
emphatic that the appendix
should be in there.

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:12.733
So this is what he wrote to
Robert Linscott, senior editor

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:17.300
at Random House, the
beginning of 1946.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.367
"When you read it, the appendix,
you will see how it

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:23.733
is the key to the whole book.

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:27.767
And after reading it, the four
sections as they stand now

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:30.533
fall into clarity and place.

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:35.200
When you issue the book, print
this appendix first and title

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.167
it, 'Appendix.' Then
continue with the

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:40.167
sections as they now are.

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:43.500
Be sure and print the
appendix first."

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.167
So Faulkner really has very
strange ideas about the

00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:51.100
importance of the appendix that
seem a little dubious

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.467
even to his devoted fan,
Malcolm Cowley.

00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:59.667
And the appendix was in fact
included in the 1946 Modern

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:01.267
Library edition.

00:06:01.267 --> 00:06:05.467
And it was included in many
editions of The Sound and the

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:09.633
Fury all through the
'50s, '60s, '70s.

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:12.433
In the '80s, editors started
taking it out.

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:16.167
And so in our edition, as you
can see, there's no appendix

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:20.600
in our edition, the Vintage
edition, which is also

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.400
published by Random House.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.367
But just for your reference, I
will post the appendix onto

00:06:27.367 --> 00:06:32.567
our website so you will see for
yourself whether Faulkner

00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:35.900
has a point, whether it is,
in fact, the key to The

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.467
Sound and the Fury.

00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:39.400
But once again, remember that
lots of people actually had

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.833
reservations about the appendix,
so don't think that

00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:47.367
it is, in fact, the
key to the novel.

00:06:47.367 --> 00:06:54.633
But the appendix does tell us
quite a bit about how Faulkner

00:06:54.633 --> 00:06:57.300
thinks about Caddy and
how he thinks about

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.467
the rest of the novel.

00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:03.067
So this is his very, very
long entry on Caddy.

00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:05.467
"Candace, Caddy.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.767
Doomed and knew it.

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:13.033
Accepted the doom without either
seeking or fleeing it.

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:16.167
Loved her brother despite him.

00:07:16.167 --> 00:07:21.400
Loved him not only in spite of
but because of the fact that

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.900
he must value above all not her
but the virginity of which

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:34.367
she was custodian and on which
she placed no value whatever.

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:37.333
Knew the brother loved
death best of

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:41.267
all and was not jealous.

00:07:41.267 --> 00:07:48.533
Vanished in Paris with the
German occupation, 1940."

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:54.133
For a good part of that entry
on Caddy, it is a very, very

00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:59.833
good summary of her place in
The Sound and the Fury.

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:04.800
And you can see why Faulkner
would not want her to tell the

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:10.000
story on her own, that her
importance in the novel is her

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.700
importance to her brothers, and
the way in which she is

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.267
really not important.

00:08:17.267 --> 00:08:18.967
She's an ideal of virginity.

00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:22.300
She's the repository of
virginity that is so important

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.433
both to Benjy and to Quentin.

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:29.667
And so she's really a cipher
for her brothers.

00:08:29.667 --> 00:08:33.300
And that's why she is what she
is, always existing in the

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.400
minds of her brothers, but never
having an independent

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.767
existence of her own.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.967
But there's one other weird
thing that comes out of the

00:08:40.967 --> 00:08:42.900
appendix, which comes out
in this little detail.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.367
And Faulkner would go on
to elaborate on that.

00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:51.367
Faulkner creates a whole other
story about Caddy, that she

00:08:51.367 --> 00:08:55.467
went to Paris, that she was
there, apparently, when the

00:08:55.467 --> 00:08:58.200
Germans occupied Paris.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.067
And then there was this other
detail about a picture of her

00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:05.833
falling into the hands of a
librarian in Jefferson, a

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:08.833
woman who looked like Caddy
who was hanging out with a

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:10.800
German Nazi officer.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.500
And the librarian wasn't sure
that that was Caddy, but she

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.367
showed the picture to Jason,
she showed the picture to

00:09:17.367 --> 00:09:20.400
Dilsey, and nobody knew whether
or not that woman who

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.000
was hanging out with
a Nazi officer,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.267
whether that was Caddy.

00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:28.000
So a whole new mystery unfolds
in the course of the appendix,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.300
and clearly Faulkner maybe was
even thinking of another novel

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.233
based on Caddy.

00:09:34.233 --> 00:09:36.667
It's his way of writing a
new novel back into--

00:09:36.667 --> 00:09:40.233
you can see that she would not
be the appropriate person to

00:09:40.233 --> 00:09:43.000
be telling the story
in section four.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.367
So we'll see what Faulkner
actually ends up with, what he

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:55.500
chooses as his representative
in section four, the most

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.167
authoritative way of telling the
story, which is actually

00:09:59.167 --> 00:10:03.067
through a third party, through
this omniscient narration.

00:10:03.067 --> 00:10:08.567
And that is linked to some
degree with his understanding

00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:12.567
of what section four is about.

00:10:12.567 --> 00:10:16.800
And that is the two people that
he mentions at the end of

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.333
the appendix.

00:10:18.333 --> 00:10:20.133
"And that was all.

00:10:20.133 --> 00:10:22.467
The others were not Compsons.

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:24.667
They were black.

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:25.433
Luster.

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:31.333
A man, aged 14, who was not only
capable of the complete

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:37.600
care and security of an idiot
twice his age and three times

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:42.233
his size, but could keep
him entertained.

00:10:42.233 --> 00:10:43.567
Dilsey.

00:10:43.567 --> 00:10:45.767
They endured."

00:10:45.767 --> 00:10:49.233
So these are the two people
that he would like to talk

00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:54.667
about, and those are the centers
in section four.

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:58.533
And I actually agree with
Faulkner that that

00:10:58.533 --> 00:10:59.500
makes a lot of sense.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.133
They have been so important
all through the novel, and

00:11:02.133 --> 00:11:05.867
finally section four is devoted
to Luster and Dilsey

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:08.933
and the world that revolves
around them and the future

00:11:08.933 --> 00:11:15.467
that emerges from this focus
on Luster and Dilsey.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:18.367
We already have seen something
about Luster, that he is very

00:11:18.367 --> 00:11:23.500
young, but he's capable of
replacing Caddy in taking good

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.600
care of Benjy.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.167
What is odd about these three
words used to describe Dilsey

00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:32.033
is "Dilsey.

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:38.167
They endured." So Faulkner is
super-conscious of pronouns,

00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:44.133
and he has a very odd use
of what appears to be a

00:11:44.133 --> 00:11:45.267
non-matching pronoun.

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.033
It should have been "Dilsey.

00:11:47.033 --> 00:11:50.667
She endures." And so
he introduces the

00:11:50.667 --> 00:11:52.200
third-person plural.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.200
And I would argue that section
four is in fact a section

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.500
dominated by that pronoun that
is invoked in this very

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.567
peculiar fashion.

00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:05.767
It is the section devoted to the
third-person plural by way

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:08.467
of someone like Dilsey.

00:12:08.467 --> 00:12:12.467
So in the rest of the lecture,
I'll be thinking about section

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:13.733
four along those lines.

00:12:16.433 --> 00:12:18.000
This is the first thing
that we notice,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.500
this omniscient narration.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.100
And these are the other points
that I would like to make

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.667
about Dilsey.

00:12:24.667 --> 00:12:27.333
Through her, we see the
legacy of slavery.

00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:30.333
We see a shift between
outside and inside.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:33.367
Omniscient narration is an
external point of view, but

00:12:33.367 --> 00:12:36.700
quite often, there's a shift
back to the interior of

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.400
Dilsey, and along with that
shift, a tension between sight

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.233
and sound, between the visual
and the auditory registers.

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:50.100
Because it's a question of
endurance. "They endure."

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.933
Faulkner is thinking about the
future of race and of the

00:12:53.933 --> 00:12:58.200
United States by way of race,
the tomorrow of race.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:03.833
And we'll test a concept that
we used last time, that we

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.967
took from Raymond Williams,
the knowable community.

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:10.633
We'll ask whether or not that
could be resurrected in

00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:11.700
section four.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.300
And the question of resurrection
comes up because

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:19.300
section four is Easter Sunday,
is the day on which some

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.633
resurrection takes place.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:24.400
So Faulkner is using that as
the frame for the idea of

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.100
resurrecting something else.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.133
And obviously, we think because
Benjy is in there

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:31.700
still, everyone else--

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.367
Jason is still there--

00:13:33.367 --> 00:13:36.867
there's a possibility of a
cross-racial "we" emerging

00:13:36.867 --> 00:13:38.733
from "They endured."

00:13:38.733 --> 00:13:43.533
And as promised last time, the
horse, Queenie, actually makes

00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:47.767
an appearance as well in
section four of The

00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:48.267
Sound and the Fury.

00:13:48.267 --> 00:13:50.367
In fact, she's very,
very important.

00:13:50.367 --> 00:13:55.867
So we're not quite at a place
where we can talk about a

00:13:55.867 --> 00:13:59.800
community made up of humans
and non-humans, but it is

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.600
interesting that it is not the
automobile but the horse that

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:05.900
comes back in a big way
at the very end of The

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.067
Sound and the Fury.

00:14:07.067 --> 00:14:11.133
So let's start out with
omniscient narration.

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:14.133
And I think that there's a
temptation on our part to

00:14:14.133 --> 00:14:17.467
think that omniscient narration
is going to be

00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:22.000
benign, that, OK, section one
is told by Benjy, who's

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.567
mentally retarded.

00:14:23.567 --> 00:14:25.800
Section two is told
by Quentin, who is

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.267
going to kill himself.

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:31.033
Section three is told by Jason,
totally obnoxious, but

00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:34.200
very sad, very pathetic
character.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.600
Section four is told by an
omniscient narrator, so we

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.200
might assume that this is going
to be benign, that this

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.800
is going to be full
of goodwill.

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.967
That is not necessarily
the case.

00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:51.633
And in fact, the omniscient
narration actually begins with

00:14:51.633 --> 00:14:57.900
a fairly off-putting, external,
and objectifying

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:02.333
view of Dilsey, in the sense
that she's turned into an

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:04.400
inert object to be observed.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.867
So it's a very striking and to
some extent puzzling narrative

00:15:08.867 --> 00:15:11.933
choice on Faulkner's part.

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:15.733
This is the morning
of Easter Sunday.

00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:21.167
"Dilsey opened the door of the
cabin and emerged, needled

00:15:21.167 --> 00:15:25.600
laterally into her flesh,
precipitating not so much a

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.133
moisture as a substance
partaking of the quality of

00:15:30.133 --> 00:15:33.800
thin, not quite congealed oil.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.333
She wore a stiff velvet cape
with a border of mangy and

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:43.700
anonymous fur about a dress of
purple silk, and she stood in

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.267
the door for a while with her
myriad and sunken face lifted

00:15:48.267 --> 00:15:53.067
to the weather, and one gaunt
hand flac-soled as the belly

00:15:53.067 --> 00:15:55.200
of a fish."

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.833
That's a repulsive picture
of Dilsey.

00:15:58.833 --> 00:16:03.400
And it is first of all observing
her at very, very

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.067
close range.

00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:09.400
This is really Dilsey captured
on not even a micro-register,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:13.700
but almost like a nano-register,
in the sense

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:18.367
that we're not even seeing her
eyes, we're not seeing her

00:16:18.367 --> 00:16:23.367
hair or the possible smile
or non-smile on her face.

00:16:23.367 --> 00:16:28.267
We're looking at something that
maybe is sweat coming out

00:16:28.267 --> 00:16:31.167
of her, but it is
not moisture.

00:16:31.167 --> 00:16:35.867
It is a thin layer of congealed
oil that's sticking

00:16:35.867 --> 00:16:37.433
to her skin.

00:16:37.433 --> 00:16:41.100
A completely physical,
mechanical description of

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.967
Dilsey at very close range.

00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:45.733
It's almost Faulkner telling
us that when it comes to

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:48.433
omniscient narration, he's
as good as the next guy.

00:16:48.433 --> 00:16:51.967
He can give us the most minute
details, the most minute

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:57.167
impersonal and non-benign
level of

00:16:57.167 --> 00:17:00.300
detail attached to Dilsey.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:04.333
From that very minute and
non-benign-- in the sense that

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:06.367
it's impersonal , it's
completely neutral--

00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:12.600
description of Dilsey, we move
on to a slightly larger scale.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.600
And now we notice the clothes
that she's wearing.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.067
And she's wearing
fancy clothes.

00:17:17.067 --> 00:17:19.367
She's wearing clothes too
good for her station.

00:17:19.367 --> 00:17:23.067
She's wearing a velvet cape
and a silk dress.

00:17:23.067 --> 00:17:26.167
So we know that those are
not really her clothes.

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:29.867
Those are the hand-me-downs
discarded by her mistress,

00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:33.867
Mrs. Compson, and she's
wearing them.

00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:39.267
So right there, we have the
legacy of slavery encoded into

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:44.233
the articles of clothing that
are to be found on Dilsey.

00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:47.367
And I would emphasize that
they are to be found on

00:17:47.367 --> 00:17:49.267
Dilsey, in the sense that
there's not a whole lot of

00:17:49.267 --> 00:17:52.833
agency in Dilsey choosing
to wear those clothes.

00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:55.533
They are just hand-me-downs
given to her.

00:17:55.533 --> 00:18:02.467
So slavery is also something
that was historically a given

00:18:02.467 --> 00:18:05.833
and quite possibly is
still a given in

00:18:05.833 --> 00:18:07.100
the twentieth century.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.033
The African-American characters
in section four are

00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:13.167
not slaves anymore.

00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:16.033
This is the twentieth century,
slavery was a thing in the

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:19.767
past. But there is still the
legacy of slavery, the shadow

00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:25.833
of slavery, hanging over
everyone's heads as Dilsey is

00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:28.967
still wearing the old clothes
of her mistress.

00:18:28.967 --> 00:18:33.500
So in that sense, in thinking
about the legacy of slavery,

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.533
The Sound and the Fury could
be seen in the company of

00:18:38.533 --> 00:18:40.267
other narratives--

00:18:40.267 --> 00:18:42.900
not novels, but narratives--

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.867
that were emerging or being
produced in the 1930s, just a

00:18:47.867 --> 00:18:49.300
little later.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.467
And this was the project
sponsored by the Federal

00:18:52.467 --> 00:18:58.167
Writers' Projects during the
Great Depression, when lots of

00:18:58.167 --> 00:19:02.433
unemployed authors were going
around the country under the

00:19:02.433 --> 00:19:06.033
sponsorship of the federal
government to talk to

00:19:06.033 --> 00:19:10.433
ex-slaves and to get the life
stories and to make sure that

00:19:10.433 --> 00:19:12.933
those are on record
and archived.

00:19:12.933 --> 00:19:16.767
So there's that desire in the
'30s to capture something that

00:19:16.767 --> 00:19:20.100
would otherwise vanish
forever.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.167
And those are really
interesting

00:19:22.167 --> 00:19:24.867
archives to look at.

00:19:24.867 --> 00:19:28.267
If you ever decide to go to
graduate school in literature

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:30.833
and decide to do something on
Faulkner, it would be very

00:19:30.833 --> 00:19:33.967
interesting to look at those
in conjunction with what

00:19:33.967 --> 00:19:37.433
Faulkner says about the slaves
in The Sound and the Fury.

00:19:37.433 --> 00:19:39.400
But that's just a reference
point that--

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.700
what else is happening.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.200
Within The Sound and the Fury,
we see that the legacy of

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.967
slavery is basically a
hostility, a visual hostility,

00:19:48.967 --> 00:19:51.700
directed against Dilsey.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.433
She's an enormously, enormously
sympathetic

00:19:55.433 --> 00:19:59.667
character, but she's not
completely immune from the

00:19:59.667 --> 00:20:05.100
hostile gaze that is part of
the omniscient narration.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.033
Omniscient narration is
completely neutral.

00:20:08.033 --> 00:20:09.433
It doesn't side with anyone.

00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:12.067
It can be both for someone
or against someone.

00:20:12.067 --> 00:20:14.467
And initially used by Faulkner,
it actually is used

00:20:14.467 --> 00:20:15.633
against Dilsey.

00:20:15.633 --> 00:20:20.267
But as is the custom with
Faulkner, quite often, we see

00:20:20.267 --> 00:20:23.567
that he is giving us both
sides to the picture.

00:20:23.567 --> 00:20:29.067
That neutral, maybe even hostile
view of Dilsey is

00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:30.867
quickly modified.

00:20:30.867 --> 00:20:34.967
And it's modified when sound
enters the picture.

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:37.867
So we're getting pretty much the
same dynamics that we've

00:20:37.867 --> 00:20:39.800
seen in Fitzgerald.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.567
The interplay of sight and
sound, the auditory and the

00:20:42.567 --> 00:20:47.600
visual registers, almost always
produces a change in

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.333
the visual field.

00:20:49.333 --> 00:20:51.600
And this is what happens
to Dilsey.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.567
And it happens in
one significant

00:20:54.567 --> 00:20:57.167
setting, the kitchen.

00:20:57.167 --> 00:20:59.700
Dilsey is preparing breakfast.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.133
"Dilsey prepared to
make biscuit.

00:21:02.133 --> 00:21:05.533
As she ground the sifter
steadily above the bread

00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:11.000
board, she sang, to herself at
first, something without

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.867
particular tune or words,
repetitive, mournful and

00:21:15.867 --> 00:21:21.433
plaintive, austere, as she
ground a faint, steady snowing

00:21:21.433 --> 00:21:24.967
of flour onto the bread board.

00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:28.867
The stove had begun to heat the
room and to fill it with

00:21:28.867 --> 00:21:34.267
murmurous minors of the fire,
and presently she was singing

00:21:34.267 --> 00:21:39.667
louder, as if her voice too
had been thawed out by the

00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:41.600
growing warmth."

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:47.567
So as voice takes over,
the pronoun also

00:21:47.567 --> 00:21:48.467
changes a little bit.

00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:53.800
We're still sticking with a
third-person singular pronoun,

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.400
but already there's a degree
of interiority emerging in

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.633
this portrait.

00:21:59.633 --> 00:22:03.967
It is not just an external
view of Dilsey, but the

00:22:03.967 --> 00:22:06.733
quality of sound that is
coming out of her.

00:22:06.733 --> 00:22:10.533
And as the quality of sound is
coming out of her, we see what

00:22:10.533 --> 00:22:14.300
she's like when she's working,
when she's in a place that

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.533
she's familiar with, that
she's at home in.

00:22:17.533 --> 00:22:19.067
That really is her domain.

00:22:19.067 --> 00:22:21.567
The kitchen is her domain.

00:22:21.567 --> 00:22:25.267
And when Dilsey is in her
domain, she turns into a

00:22:25.267 --> 00:22:28.600
different kind of person.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.500
The sound that she makes is
still attached to the work

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:32.667
that she has to do.

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:37.333
So there's no cessation of work
as she sings, but the

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:42.333
very rhythm of work enables
Dilsey to turn into a

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:43.600
different kind of character.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.600
She's very, very different when
she's singing than when

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:52.200
she's seen as an inert object
outside her cabin.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:56.300
And one thing that happens, one
other thing that emerges

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.967
about Dilsey in the kitchen
is that she has

00:23:01.967 --> 00:23:03.967
a relation to time.

00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:09.033
And here, I just want to say
that in section four, there's

00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:13.633
actually both something that
emerges about Dilsey but that

00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:19.000
is also a backward reference to
a very emblematic moment in

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.400
each of the three preceding
sections.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.633
So what we'll see in section
four, I think this is the

00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:29.567
structure that Faulkner is
working, a really very

00:23:29.567 --> 00:23:33.167
intricate and very well-crafted
structure, is to

00:23:33.167 --> 00:23:39.200
give us one moment that is
emblematic of Dilsey that is a

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:45.767
response, a rejoinder, or an
amendment to an earlier moment

00:23:45.767 --> 00:23:49.200
that was problematic in one
of the preceding sections.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:55.867
So let's look at this very
interesting moment, very

00:23:55.867 --> 00:24:00.467
memorable and graphic moment,
although with sounds thrown in

00:24:00.467 --> 00:24:02.967
about Dilsey, also
in the kitchen.

00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:08.167
"...On the wall above a
cupboard, invisible save at

00:24:08.167 --> 00:24:14.467
night by lamp light and even
then evincing an enigmatic

00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:19.567
profundity because it had but
one hand, a cabinet clock

00:24:19.567 --> 00:24:23.233
ticked, then with a preliminary
sound as if it had

00:24:23.233 --> 00:24:28.000
cleared its throat,
struck five times.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.367
'Eight o'clock,' Dilsey said."

00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:37.067
So the clock is striking
five o'clock.

00:24:37.067 --> 00:24:38.800
Dilsey knows it's
eight o'clock.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:39.867
She's not up at five.

00:24:39.867 --> 00:24:41.167
Even though she's hard-working,
she's

00:24:41.167 --> 00:24:42.567
not up at five AM.

00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:44.867
She's up at eight AM.

00:24:44.867 --> 00:24:46.867
She knows that this
is eight o'clock.

00:24:46.867 --> 00:24:48.733
She knows the clock very well.

00:24:48.733 --> 00:24:53.633
So we are back to the notion
of a knowable community.

00:24:53.633 --> 00:24:57.533
And in this case, it is
a community between

00:24:57.533 --> 00:25:00.067
Dilsey and the clock.

00:25:00.067 --> 00:25:05.433
And significantly, it emerges
in the course of

00:25:05.433 --> 00:25:07.800
working, hard labor--

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.000
well, hard enough--

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.567
but it's in the course
of working.

00:25:12.567 --> 00:25:14.967
And it's in a very
familiar setting.

00:25:14.967 --> 00:25:17.167
This is the most important
thing, that the kitchen is a

00:25:17.167 --> 00:25:20.167
familiar setting to
Dilsey, and the

00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:22.500
clock is also her familiar.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:26.700
It is a mechanical contrivance,
but in this case,

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.433
it is a mechanical contrivance
that isn't quite working.

00:25:30.433 --> 00:25:32.500
First of all, the clock
is really not

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.100
doing a number of things.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.033
It is invisible in
broad daylight.

00:25:36.033 --> 00:25:39.067
You can only see it at night by
lamp light, and even then,

00:25:39.067 --> 00:25:42.267
you can barely see it, because
it only has one hand.

00:25:42.267 --> 00:25:44.567
So it's not functioning
properly.

00:25:44.567 --> 00:25:46.467
It's also not functioning
properly because it's not

00:25:46.467 --> 00:25:48.333
telling the right time.

00:25:48.333 --> 00:25:53.167
But all that only makes the
kitchen a more important

00:25:53.167 --> 00:25:54.133
knowable community.

00:25:54.133 --> 00:25:57.833
It's only when you have a
defective instrument and you

00:25:57.833 --> 00:26:00.233
know that instrument very well
that you can prove that you

00:26:00.233 --> 00:26:01.667
actually know this
domain very well.

00:26:01.667 --> 00:26:06.633
So Dilsey's knowledge of this
place is proven without--

00:26:09.767 --> 00:26:13.133
it's beyond doubt that she knows
this place very well.

00:26:13.133 --> 00:26:18.900
And this emblematic moment about
Dilsey obviously brings

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:24.067
back an equally emblematic
moment about Quentin and his

00:26:24.067 --> 00:26:25.833
relation to his watch.

00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:29.300
This is the first thing that
we know about Quentin.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:34.467
So let's look at this opening
of his section and his

00:26:34.467 --> 00:26:37.533
relation to time, as we have
seen, and especially his

00:26:37.533 --> 00:26:40.867
relation to his own watch,
his grandfather's watch.

00:26:40.867 --> 00:26:45.400
"When the shadow of the sash
appeared on the curtains, it

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.600
was between seven and eight
o'clock and then

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.000
I was in time again...

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.633
I went to the dresser and took
up the watch with the face

00:26:55.633 --> 00:26:57.033
still down.

00:26:57.033 --> 00:27:01.100
I tapped the crystal on the
corner of the dresser and

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.533
caught the fragments of glass in
my hand and put them in the

00:27:05.533 --> 00:27:10.933
ashtray and twisted the hands
off and put them in the tray.

00:27:10.933 --> 00:27:13.100
The watch ticked on."

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.667
So two points of context between
the Dilsey section and

00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:18.533
this section.

00:27:18.533 --> 00:27:21.967
Eight o'clock, same time,
except that they have a

00:27:21.967 --> 00:27:26.833
completely different relation to
eight o'clock, to the time

00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:28.033
that is eight o'clock.

00:27:28.033 --> 00:27:29.933
For Dilsey, it's another day.

00:27:29.933 --> 00:27:33.167
And we know that there'll
be many more eight

00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:34.967
o'clocks for her.

00:27:34.967 --> 00:27:40.367
For Quentin, this is the last
eight o'clock he would ever

00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:41.167
experience.

00:27:41.167 --> 00:27:44.233
It is the very end of
the line for him.

00:27:44.233 --> 00:27:48.833
So right then and there, that
tells us fully who has a

00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:51.400
future and who doesn't.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:57.333
But the other thing is that
Dilsey is able to make do with

00:27:57.333 --> 00:28:00.067
a broken clock.

00:28:00.067 --> 00:28:05.133
Quentin is the one who has a
well-functioning watch that he

00:28:05.133 --> 00:28:10.800
smashes, twists off the
hands of that watch.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:14.767
And of course, he hurts his hand
in the course of smashing

00:28:14.767 --> 00:28:15.967
that watch.

00:28:15.967 --> 00:28:21.933
So right there, it is a capsule
summary of his futile

00:28:21.933 --> 00:28:25.833
battle with time and the
way Quentin gets

00:28:25.833 --> 00:28:27.067
bloodied on this day.

00:28:27.067 --> 00:28:31.533
This is finally the day when
he loses some kind of

00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:36.000
virginity, loses the virginity
about time, maybe.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.233
He is bloodied in his
struggle with time.

00:28:39.233 --> 00:28:45.100
So it's a very eloquent
rejoinder to that earlier

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.267
moment, but also a rewriting
of that earlier moment.

00:28:49.267 --> 00:28:51.267
It is a dead end for Quentin.

00:28:51.267 --> 00:28:52.867
There's no doubt about it.

00:28:52.867 --> 00:28:55.533
There's no way Faulkner can keep
on-- although, I should

00:28:55.533 --> 00:28:59.467
say, actually, in terms of
Faulkner's own novels, he

00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:01.967
actually wrote another novel,
Absalom, Absalom!,

00:29:01.967 --> 00:29:04.633
resurrecting Quentin
in that novel.

00:29:04.633 --> 00:29:09.433
So he actually manages to find a
way to bring Quentin back as

00:29:09.433 --> 00:29:11.367
well by writing another
novel about him.

00:29:11.367 --> 00:29:14.000
But within The Sound and the
Fury, there's no way he can

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.200
bring Quentin back alive.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:20.733
And instead the only way he can
resurrect Quentin in some

00:29:20.733 --> 00:29:27.767
fashion is to resurrect him by
way of Dilsey and her ability

00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:31.633
to make do with time, to come to
terms with time, to come to

00:29:31.633 --> 00:29:36.200
terms both with a defective
present, and in coming to

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.533
terms with a defective
present, to

00:29:38.533 --> 00:29:40.700
live on to the future.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:45.000
So by way of Dilsey, we can
start thinking about the

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.400
all-important concept
of tomorrow.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.067
And it has to do with the
tomorrow of race.

00:29:50.067 --> 00:29:52.867
So we know, first of all, the
importance of the kitchen and

00:29:52.867 --> 00:29:55.533
what takes place
in the kitchen.

00:29:55.533 --> 00:29:58.167
We also know in the rest of
the section that there's

00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:01.967
another place that is as
important as the kitchen, and

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:03.400
that is the black church.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:07.367
So these are the two emblematic
locales where there

00:30:07.367 --> 00:30:11.200
could be a tomorrow and where
there could be an interesting

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:16.033
development to that pronoun,
third-person plural.

00:30:16.033 --> 00:30:19.267
And we'll see that
in the church.

00:30:19.267 --> 00:30:22.733
the central figure in that
church is the preacher, the

00:30:22.733 --> 00:30:25.333
Reverend Shegog, and we'll
see what he does.

00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:28.100
And we know that this is Easter
Sunday, so this is the

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.200
resurrection of something.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.633
And we'll finally talk about
the possibility of that

00:30:32.633 --> 00:30:35.733
utopian ideal, a cross-racial
"we."

00:30:35.733 --> 00:30:41.000
But first of all, this is the
church, the Christian

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.567
Methodist Episcopal church
in Oxford, Mississippi.

00:30:46.567 --> 00:30:48.867
It's a historic church.

00:30:48.867 --> 00:30:53.500
And I want to bring to your
attention a figure who's

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.300
written eloquently about the
black church, and that is

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:59.133
someone you might have
read in another

00:30:59.133 --> 00:31:03.100
class, W. E. B. Du Bois.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.467
He was a very important author,
but he also actually

00:31:07.467 --> 00:31:09.000
studied sociology.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.033
So he wrote a 1903 book called
The Negro Church, basically a

00:31:14.033 --> 00:31:19.400
sociological report based on
lots of field work about black

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.933
churches in the South.

00:31:21.933 --> 00:31:25.567
Most of us probably haven't
read The Negro Church--

00:31:25.567 --> 00:31:28.567
probably only specialists would
be reading that book--

00:31:28.567 --> 00:31:32.867
but there's another book by Du
Bois that I bet a lot you have

00:31:32.867 --> 00:31:36.100
read or heard of, The Souls
of Black Folk, also

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.367
coming out in 1903.

00:31:38.367 --> 00:31:41.133
And because he was doing this
sociological field work at the

00:31:41.133 --> 00:31:44.267
same time as he was writing this
book, not surprisingly,

00:31:44.267 --> 00:31:47.300
he had a lot to say about
the black church.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.200
He has a whole chapter called
"The Faith of Our Fathers" in

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.000
which he talks at length
about the black church.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.400
And this is what he says.

00:31:58.367 --> 00:32:00.767
And he links the black church
back to the religion of the

00:32:00.767 --> 00:32:03.767
slaves, so this is another way
in which there's the legacy of

00:32:03.767 --> 00:32:08.433
slavery in the centrality
of the black church.

00:32:08.433 --> 00:32:11.800
"Three things characterized the
religion of the slave--

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:16.267
the Preacher, the Music,
and the Frenzy.

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:20.667
The preacher is the most unique
personality developed

00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:24.500
by the Negro on the
American soil.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:30.867
A leader, a politician, an
orator, a boss, an intriguer,

00:32:30.867 --> 00:32:32.467
an idealist--

00:32:32.467 --> 00:32:36.933
all these he is and ever too the
center of a group of men

00:32:36.933 --> 00:32:40.967
now twenty, now a thousand
in number."

00:32:40.967 --> 00:32:43.233
Du Bois' account of the
preacher is really

00:32:43.233 --> 00:32:44.067
interesting.

00:32:44.067 --> 00:32:49.867
Because this preacher is both
someone who is a conveyor of a

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:55.400
form of Christianity, a form of
spirituality, but Du Bois

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.633
also sees that he's
more than that.

00:32:57.633 --> 00:33:00.067
He's a politician.

00:33:00.067 --> 00:33:02.033
He's an orator.

00:33:02.033 --> 00:33:04.800
He has to be very good
at what he's doing.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.133
He's a boss to some extent.

00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:10.200
So there are all these other
non-spiritual dimensions

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.800
attached to the preacher.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.467
And that is indeed the case,
because the black church, even

00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:20.567
though a church like this seems
very local, because it's

00:33:20.567 --> 00:33:22.433
part of the Methodist church.

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:27.067
The local Methodist church
actually belongs to a national

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:28.133
denomination.

00:33:28.133 --> 00:33:30.933
The Methodist church is a
national denomination.

00:33:30.933 --> 00:33:35.033
And quite often, preachers would
actually go from one

00:33:35.033 --> 00:33:36.567
city to another.

00:33:36.567 --> 00:33:40.033
The preacher is not always
stationed at one place.

00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:45.500
And that turns out to be the
case with the Reverend Shegog

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.700
in The Sound and the Fury.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.467
This is the background to why
this preacher is actually

00:33:50.467 --> 00:33:52.667
brought all the way
from St. Louis.

00:33:52.667 --> 00:33:55.400
He's not the local preacher.

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.933
He's brought in for the
Easter Sunday service

00:33:58.933 --> 00:34:01.033
especially from St. Louis.

00:34:01.033 --> 00:34:05.167
And so there's something both
very special but potentially

00:34:05.167 --> 00:34:07.267
alien about him.

00:34:07.267 --> 00:34:17.800
And Faulkner gives us once again
a two-part portrait of

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.067
the Reverend Shegog, a two-part
portrait that is

00:34:22.067 --> 00:34:23.533
based on a reversal.

00:34:23.533 --> 00:34:27.567
As with Dilsey, we see an
external view of the Reverend

00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:32.167
Shegog, and then we see a much
more interior view of the

00:34:32.167 --> 00:34:32.600
Reverend Shegog.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.533
But this is the external view,
looking at him strictly from

00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:41.033
the standpoint of a small-town
black church, looking at this

00:34:41.033 --> 00:34:47.267
supposedly very important
visitor coming from St. Louis.

00:34:47.267 --> 00:34:53.367
"The visitor was undersized,
in a shabby alpaca coat.

00:34:53.367 --> 00:34:59.433
He had a wizened black face like
a small, aged monkey...

00:34:59.433 --> 00:35:03.867
When the visitor rose to speak
he sounded like a white man.

00:35:03.867 --> 00:35:05.967
His voice was level and cold.

00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:10.733
It sounded too big to have
come from him and they

00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:14.467
listened at first through
curiosity, as they would have

00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:17.067
to a monkey talking.

00:35:17.067 --> 00:35:20.667
They began to watch him as they
would a man on a tight

00:35:20.667 --> 00:35:22.333
rope."

00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:24.633
So this is very much an external
view of the Reverend

00:35:24.633 --> 00:35:28.033
Shegog, and it's not
a sympathetic view.

00:35:28.033 --> 00:35:32.233
He's someone that the
congregation for the black

00:35:32.233 --> 00:35:35.367
local church was highly
suspicious of.

00:35:35.367 --> 00:35:38.200
And in fact, they were very
disappointed in him, that he

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.700
had come all the way from St.
Louis-- he's been brought in

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.600
at some expense from
St. Louis--

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.167
and it turns out that
he's much, much less

00:35:45.167 --> 00:35:49.600
impressive-looking than their
own preacher whom they would

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.333
see every week.

00:35:51.333 --> 00:35:54.533
So it was a terrible
disappointment for them to

00:35:54.533 --> 00:36:01.433
look at this monkey-like,
tiny, clownish figure.

00:36:01.433 --> 00:36:04.367
And even when he starts
speaking, he's still

00:36:04.367 --> 00:36:05.267
off-putting.

00:36:05.267 --> 00:36:09.167
They're not warming up to him
right away, because he sounds

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:10.667
like a white man.

00:36:10.667 --> 00:36:14.367
This is a very peculiar detail
on Faulkner's part, and

00:36:14.367 --> 00:36:17.333
there's no other way of
accounting for it other than

00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:23.300
that he was really thinking of
the preacher as Du Bois would,

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.600
that he's not just a
representative of some kind of

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.167
spirituality, but that he's
also an operator and a

00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:30.700
politician.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:36.633
And speaking like a black man
is possibly a sign that he

00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:38.767
operates in that mode.

00:36:38.767 --> 00:36:41.833
But we get a reversal.

00:36:41.833 --> 00:36:45.567
We get a switch to a totally
different view of

00:36:45.567 --> 00:36:46.567
the Reverend Shegog.

00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:49.967
And I should say that this
external view of the Reverend

00:36:49.967 --> 00:36:52.633
Shegog really has to do with
looking at him as an inert

00:36:52.633 --> 00:36:55.233
object, this impersonal,
objective

00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:56.400
gaze directed at him.

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.200
And he indeed looks like a
monkey if you just look at him

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.333
as a single individual.

00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:07.267
So from that alienating
perspective, we now turn to

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:12.733
another look at him, which is
not as a single individual,

00:37:12.733 --> 00:37:14.500
but as a communal voice.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:21.067
So this is the two poles that
Faulkner tries to negotiate by

00:37:21.067 --> 00:37:25.633
way of the Reverend Shegog,
that he could be looked at

00:37:25.633 --> 00:37:28.700
just as a single individual,
this big-shot preacher from

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:33.767
St. Louis, or he could be fused
with a community as a

00:37:33.767 --> 00:37:36.033
voice speaking for them.

00:37:36.033 --> 00:37:39.633
And he takes on a completely
different set of qualities

00:37:39.633 --> 00:37:42.733
when he's seen in that light,
fused with the community.

00:37:42.733 --> 00:37:47.667
"And the congregation seemed
to watch with its own eyes

00:37:47.667 --> 00:37:53.267
while the voice consumed him,
until he was nothing and they

00:37:53.267 --> 00:37:57.900
were nothing and there was not
even a voice but instead their

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:02.367
hearts were speaking to one
another in chanting measures

00:38:02.367 --> 00:38:06.100
beyond the need for words, so
that when he came to rest

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:10.833
against the reading desk, his
monkey face lifted and his

00:38:10.833 --> 00:38:16.033
whole attitude, that of a
serene, tortured crucifix that

00:38:16.033 --> 00:38:20.333
transcended its shabbiness and
insignificance and made it of

00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:26.067
no moment, a long moaning
expulsion of breath rose from

00:38:26.067 --> 00:38:29.433
them, and a woman's
single soprano--

00:38:29.433 --> 00:38:32.867
'Yes, Jesus!'"

00:38:32.867 --> 00:38:37.100
We're beginning to figure out
why the external, objectifying

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:42.633
view of the black characters is
so deliberately demeaning,

00:38:42.633 --> 00:38:46.300
is so deliberately
hostile to them.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:52.367
Because Faulkner in fact wants
to suggest that most people,

00:38:52.367 --> 00:38:55.700
if you just look at them,
they're really nothing to

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.833
write home about.

00:38:57.833 --> 00:39:01.767
They are very sad-looking
specimens of humanity.

00:39:01.767 --> 00:39:06.233
But the most important thing
is that these sad-looking

00:39:06.233 --> 00:39:11.600
specimens of humanity can be
transformed under the proper

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:13.167
circumstances.

00:39:13.167 --> 00:39:15.100
And listening to the voice--

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.767
in this case, listening to the
voice of the Reverend Shegog--

00:39:18.767 --> 00:39:24.400
in conjunction with the voice
of the black congregation,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.667
that is one circumstance when
we completely forget the

00:39:28.667 --> 00:39:34.233
insignificant physical
appearance of this man.

00:39:34.233 --> 00:39:37.167
He becomes nothing, the
congregation becomes nothing,

00:39:37.167 --> 00:39:38.400
and that's a good thing.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.933
When they become nothing, then
what really does register is

00:39:41.933 --> 00:39:46.200
that voice and what that voice
is able to do for the

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.200
congregation.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.967
So this is without question the
moment of epiphany in The

00:39:51.967 --> 00:39:55.433
Sound and the Fury, and it's
by way of this initially

00:39:55.433 --> 00:40:00.333
dubious-looking preacher, who
then actually transcends that

00:40:00.333 --> 00:40:05.467
and is able, in fact, to do what
is supposed to be done on

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:08.767
Easter Sunday, which is to
bring about some kind of

00:40:08.767 --> 00:40:10.700
resurrection.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:17.967
So this is what we're already
beginning to see happen.

00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:22.333
We've already seen a little bit
of it in Dilsey's relation

00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:27.167
to the clock in her kitchen, and
now we see something else

00:40:27.167 --> 00:40:29.667
that also happens
in the kitchen.

00:40:29.667 --> 00:40:35.700
And it is the other black
character, Luster, and Benjy

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:37.167
in the kitchen.

00:40:37.167 --> 00:40:39.200
Section four, Benjy comes
back in a big way.

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.733
So in many ways, this is Benjy
almost incorporated into the

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:45.567
black community.

00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:51.500
We've mentioned earlier that the
way in which he and Luster

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:55.133
constitute a unit, and Luster
being his significant other.

00:40:55.133 --> 00:40:59.867
And here, we once again see
Benjy as Luster's significant

00:40:59.867 --> 00:41:02.467
other and the other way
around as well.

00:41:02.467 --> 00:41:06.000
"Luster fed him with skill
and detachment.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.567
Now and then, his attention
would return long enough to

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:13.967
enable him to feint the spoon
and cause Ben to close his

00:41:13.967 --> 00:41:17.667
mouth upon the empty air, but it
was apparent that Luster's

00:41:17.667 --> 00:41:20.200
mind was elsewhere.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:24.100
His other hand lay on the back
of the chair and upon that

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:29.433
dead surface, it moved
tentatively, delicately, as if

00:41:29.433 --> 00:41:35.233
he were picking an inaudible
tune out of the dead void.

00:41:35.233 --> 00:41:39.033
And once he even forgot to tease
Ben with the spoon while

00:41:39.033 --> 00:41:44.100
his fingers teased out of the
slain wood a soundless and

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:49.367
involved arpeggio until Ben
recalled him by whimpering

00:41:49.367 --> 00:41:51.233
again."

00:41:51.233 --> 00:41:56.533
Very odd detail about Luster.

00:41:56.533 --> 00:42:02.800
Luster doesn't play any musical
instrument at all.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:09.800
Faulkner is counter-factually
representing him as picking an

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.067
inaudible tune.

00:42:12.067 --> 00:42:16.067
And not only is it an inaudible
tune, not only has

00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:21.400
Luster become a musician in this
moment, but he's playing

00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:25.800
a special kind of music,
an arpeggio.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.033
So what is an arpeggio?

00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:34.667
It is a special musical
technique, the chord not being

00:42:34.667 --> 00:42:37.900
played in unison, but
played in sequence.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.467
Usually, the chord would be
played together, but the

00:42:41.467 --> 00:42:43.900
arpeggio is one in which you
play the chord in sequence,

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.967
one at a time.

00:42:44.967 --> 00:42:53.067
So the English translation for
the Italian word "arpeggio" is

00:42:53.067 --> 00:42:55.167
actually a broken chord.

00:42:55.167 --> 00:43:01.867
And this is actually a kind of
music that Luster plays is

00:43:01.867 --> 00:43:07.600
that slavery and the legacy of
slavery, is that broken chord.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.000
It is not the most harmonious
kind of music.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.667
But as we know, Schubert
actually has a great piece of

00:43:15.667 --> 00:43:18.167
music called the Arpeggione
Sonata.

00:43:18.167 --> 00:43:21.067
It's a wonderful piece of music,
and it's one of the

00:43:21.067 --> 00:43:24.433
most famous signature
pieces by Schubert.

00:43:24.433 --> 00:43:29.533
But Luster isn't quite
playing that.

00:43:29.533 --> 00:43:35.233
But his arpeggio is interesting
in that Faulkner's

00:43:35.233 --> 00:43:40.467
turning this not very well
schooled black character into

00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:41.900
a trained musician.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:47.967
So this is the reconstitution of
a knowable community based

00:43:47.967 --> 00:43:50.500
on a special kind
of knowledge.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:54.167
And we know that Luster actually
does know something.

00:43:54.167 --> 00:43:54.967
He knows something.

00:43:54.967 --> 00:43:56.800
That's why he's absent-minded.

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.467
His mind is fixated on something
else, something that

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:01.867
only he knows.

00:44:01.867 --> 00:44:08.167
So let's go back to what it is
that Luster knows that makes

00:44:08.167 --> 00:44:11.767
him so absent-minded
at this moment.

00:44:11.767 --> 00:44:17.300
This is the second reference
back to an earlier moment in

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.033
an earlier section.

00:44:19.033 --> 00:44:21.600
This is actually the very ending
of the Benjy section.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.200
So that one is resurrected
as well in the

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.433
absent-mindedness of Luster.

00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:32.067
Same configuration,
Luster and Benjy.

00:44:32.067 --> 00:44:33.367
"He put my gown on.

00:44:33.367 --> 00:44:36.100
I hushed, and then Luster
stopped, his

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:37.700
head toward the window.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.200
Then he went to the window
and looked out.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.500
He came back and took my arm.

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.900
Here she come, he said.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.633
Be quiet now.

00:44:45.633 --> 00:44:47.567
We went to the window
and looked out.

00:44:47.567 --> 00:44:50.833
It came out of Quentin's
window and climbed

00:44:50.833 --> 00:44:53.167
across into the tree.

00:44:53.167 --> 00:44:54.700
We watched the tree shaking.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:57.000
The shaking went
down the tree.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.733
Then it came out, and
we watched it

00:44:58.733 --> 00:45:00.233
go across the grass.

00:45:00.233 --> 00:45:03.400
Then we couldn't see it."

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.800
Benjy is totally clueless
at this moment.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.300
Luster is already knowledgeable
about what

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.700
exactly is coming out of
Quentin's window, so that when

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.200
we do find out in section four
that Quentin has run away,

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.833
that she's taken all of Jason's
money with her when

00:45:22.833 --> 00:45:28.067
she runs away, that is
old news to Luster.

00:45:28.067 --> 00:45:30.767
He's known all through
the novel, starting

00:45:30.767 --> 00:45:33.367
from section one.

00:45:33.367 --> 00:45:36.933
That bit of knowledge is
in his possession.

00:45:36.933 --> 00:45:42.633
So this is the reconstitution
of a knowable community for

00:45:42.633 --> 00:45:46.233
Luster is that he is familiar.

00:45:46.233 --> 00:45:48.067
Quentin is his familiar.

00:45:48.067 --> 00:45:50.967
He knows her well enough to know
that this is something

00:45:50.967 --> 00:45:52.967
that she might do.

00:45:52.967 --> 00:45:57.033
And it is that reconstitution
of a knowable community that

00:45:57.033 --> 00:46:01.500
once again resurrects this
previous moment from Benjy and

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.033
allows it to take
on a new life.

00:46:04.033 --> 00:46:08.367
So since we're already looking
at the structure of two

00:46:08.367 --> 00:46:14.067
resurrected earlier moments in
section four of The Sound and

00:46:14.067 --> 00:46:16.633
the Fury, let's look
at the resurrection

00:46:16.633 --> 00:46:18.367
of one other thing.

00:46:18.367 --> 00:46:21.700
And not surprisingly, it is the
third brother who would

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.367
get resurrected in
that moment.

00:46:24.367 --> 00:46:30.067
And this has to do with a
landmark in Oxford, which is

00:46:30.067 --> 00:46:31.700
the Courthouse Square.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.767
And we know that Luster and
Benjy are in a habit of going

00:46:35.767 --> 00:46:41.333
out for a ride with Queenie,
the horse.

00:46:41.333 --> 00:46:46.167
But in this case, at the very
end of The Sound and the Fury,

00:46:46.167 --> 00:46:48.533
something seems to
be going wrong.

00:46:48.533 --> 00:46:52.933
Luster and Benjy go on a ride
probably every day, and

00:46:52.933 --> 00:46:55.700
nothing especially happens.

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.967
It's just a peaceful ride.

00:46:57.967 --> 00:47:01.700
But on this one occasion,
something

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.600
seems to be going wrong.

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:10.133
And Benjy is bellowing without
stopping on this ride.

00:47:10.133 --> 00:47:13.667
Something seems to
be going wrong.

00:47:13.667 --> 00:47:19.133
Luster, for all his knowledge
of what Quentin does, is

00:47:19.133 --> 00:47:22.433
actually incapable of
controlling this situation.

00:47:22.433 --> 00:47:27.900
He's unable to stop Benjy
from bellowing.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.733
It actually takes Jason's
intervention to stop the

00:47:32.733 --> 00:47:34.567
bellowing of Benjy.

00:47:34.567 --> 00:47:40.033
So let's look at what it is
that Jason is able to do.

00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:44.700
"With a backhanded blow, he
hurled Luster aside and caught

00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.767
the reins and sawed Queenie
about and doubled the reins

00:47:48.767 --> 00:47:51.600
back and slashed her
across the hips.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:56.200
He cut her again and again into
a plunging gallop, while

00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.167
Ben's hoarse agony roared about
them, and swung her

00:48:00.167 --> 00:48:02.633
about to the right
of the monument.

00:48:02.633 --> 00:48:06.300
Then he struck Luster over the
head with his fist. 'Don't you

00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:09.467
know better than to take him
to the left?' he said.

00:48:09.467 --> 00:48:12.100
He reached back and struck
Ben, breaking the

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.000
flower stalk again.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.500
"...Queenie moved again.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:20.233
Her feet began to clop-clop
steadily again, and at once,

00:48:20.233 --> 00:48:23.267
Ben hushed.

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:26.667
Luster looked quickly back
over his shoulder,

00:48:26.667 --> 00:48:28.200
then he drove on.

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.567
The broken flower drooped over
Ben's fist, and his eyes were

00:48:32.567 --> 00:48:37.500
empty and blue and serene again,
as cornice and facade

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:43.400
flowed smoothly once more from
left to right, post and tree,

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.567
window and doorway and
signboard, each in its ordered

00:48:48.567 --> 00:48:49.967
place."

00:48:49.967 --> 00:48:54.933
So that was what went wrong
initially with the ride is

00:48:54.933 --> 00:48:59.067
that Luster, for some reason,
had forgotten that they're

00:48:59.067 --> 00:49:03.233
supposed to go to the right
of the monument.

00:49:03.233 --> 00:49:07.267
He makes Queenie go to the left,
and so everything is

00:49:07.267 --> 00:49:09.467
happening in the wrong order.

00:49:09.467 --> 00:49:14.100
And because Benjy cannot stand
anything happening in the

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:18.367
wrong order, nothing will
stop him from bellowing.

00:49:18.367 --> 00:49:22.067
So this is a very interesting
moment when Faulkner has

00:49:22.067 --> 00:49:24.200
granted to Luster a
lot of knowledge.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.300
He knows Quentin very well,
but for some reason, he

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.100
doesn't know Benjy on
this one occasion.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.100
It takes Jason actually to
demonstrate his knowledge of

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.200
his own brother, Benjy.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.367
He doesn't love Benjy, but
he knows Benjy very well.

00:49:38.367 --> 00:49:41.467
He knows that it would have
to be to the right of the

00:49:41.467 --> 00:49:44.567
monument, and he's able to
correct that mistake.

00:49:44.567 --> 00:49:49.133
So after all we've seen, Jason's
terrible problems with

00:49:49.133 --> 00:49:54.500
the automobile, at the very end
of The Sound and the Fury,

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:58.800
Faulkner is able to resurrect
Jason into a

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.867
much happier fate.

00:50:00.867 --> 00:50:02.900
Automobile is gone.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:07.133
It's back to the world of
horses and carriages, a

00:50:07.133 --> 00:50:11.567
19th-century world still
lingering on and to some

00:50:11.567 --> 00:50:16.833
extent accommodating Jason
even in the 20th century.

00:50:16.833 --> 00:50:18.533
It's not a pretty sight.

00:50:18.533 --> 00:50:21.600
It's not a non-violent world.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.400
Jason is still hitting Luster.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.567
He's breaking Ben's flower.

00:50:26.567 --> 00:50:29.467
So none of the obnoxious
things about

00:50:29.467 --> 00:50:31.233
Jason have gone away.

00:50:31.233 --> 00:50:33.600
He hasn't turned into
a sweet person.

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.067
He's still a monster.

00:50:35.067 --> 00:50:39.367
But while he remains a monster,
Faulkner has made his

00:50:39.367 --> 00:50:43.700
world one that he can live in
and that he can be a hero of

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.867
sorts in this very
one brief moment.

00:50:45.867 --> 00:50:49.467
He can be the person who comes
to the rescue and set

00:50:49.467 --> 00:50:53.033
everything back onto the
right track, literally.

00:50:53.033 --> 00:50:56.933
So this is a way in which the
very ending of The Sound and

00:50:56.933 --> 00:51:00.700
the Fury is in fact an Easter
Sunday story

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:01.967
about resurrection.

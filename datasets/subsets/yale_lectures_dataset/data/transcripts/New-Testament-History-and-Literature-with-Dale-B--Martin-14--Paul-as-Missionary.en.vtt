00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.254
Prof: The last time we
talked about the historical

00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:08.080
Jesus,
and I talked about some of the

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.690
methodology that scholars debate
about what criteria you use to

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.151
figure out what in the Gospels
might tell you something about

00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:21.910
the actual historical Jesus and
what may be later writing,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.473
or myths, or legends,
or editions of the Gospel

00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:27.100
writers themselves.
 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.810
There's a very similar kind of
problem with Paul,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.506
and it's rather debatable what
we know historically about the

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:38.732
historical Paul than what we
find in different literary

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:39.750
accounts.
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.620
With Paul there's a lot more to
go on.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.620
For one thing,
as I'll explain later today,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.940
we actually have at least seven
letters from Paul that he wrote

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.843
himself that most scholars
believe are actually authentic

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:53.680
to Paul.
 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.660
Then we have some other letters
that are written in his name.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.649
We also have the traditions
that are in the Book of Acts of

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.691
the Apostles that you've read,
which talk about Paul and his

00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:03.310
travels.
 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.855
There's a lot more material to
go on with Paul but there's

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:10.402
still quite a bit of debate
about what is historical about

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:13.924
Paul and what is later legend,
or what is stuff that's just in

00:01:13.924 --> 00:01:16.438
some of the letters that may not
have been by him at all.

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:18.879
In fact, if you remember,
we go back to the lecture we

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.950
had at the very beginning of the
semester,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.670
one of the times where we
talked about where does Paul go

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.233
when in the Book of Acts,
where does he go according to

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:29.349
Galatians 1 and 2.
 

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:32.998
At that point I tried to show
that the two accounts of Paul's

00:01:32.998 --> 00:01:35.980
back and forth between Damascus
and Jerusalem,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.709
the amount of time he spent in
Jerusalem,

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:39.074
when he was there,
for how long,

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:40.388
who he saw,
who knew him,

00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:43.565
all those different things that
are presented in the Book of

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:45.653
Acts,
I argued are probably not

00:01:45.653 --> 00:01:49.565
historical because if we've got
Paul's own descriptions of his

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:53.075
movements in Galatians 1 and 2,
it's much more likely,

00:01:53.075 --> 00:01:56.236
we think, that we have more
accurate historical material

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:58.480
from Galatians then we do from
Acts.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.328
That's one of the places we
would go is first to try to see

00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:04.129
what we've got in Acts,
what do we have in his letters.

00:02:04.129 --> 00:02:06.489
This is a controversial thing
too.

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:09.804
What I've said is Paul probably
didn't spend nearly as much time

00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:13.066
in Jerusalem as the Acts of the
Apostles wants to make it sound

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:13.538
like.
 

00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:17.608
I don't believe he started off
his ministry in Jerusalem,

00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:19.860
as Acts makes it sound to be.
 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.235
There will be other things
about Paul that I'll talk about

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:26.907
today from Acts that I at least
believe we should doubt whether

00:02:26.907 --> 00:02:30.139
they're historical,
or at least we can't use them

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.881
in any kind of dependable way as
providing a biography of the

00:02:33.881 --> 00:02:34.878
Apostle Paul.
 

00:02:34.878 --> 00:02:40.970
What does Paul though tell us
about himself?

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.638
Well actually let me say this,
that's not all there is with

00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:43.960
Paul.
 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.435
There's a ton more material
about Paul that you have to work

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:49.910
through in the whole European
tradition.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.538
Paul has been thought of as the
founder of Christianity.

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:57.378
Some people have said,
Jesus was not really the

00:02:57.378 --> 00:02:59.334
founder of Christianity,
he was a moral prophet,

00:02:59.334 --> 00:03:01.158
he went around talking about
different things,

00:03:01.158 --> 00:03:03.610
Paul was the one who really
founded Christianity,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.622
he was the one who built
churches, he was the one who

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:07.830
came up with the dogmas and
doctrines of Christianity,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.954
he's the one who preached that
what's the central aspect of

00:03:10.954 --> 00:03:14.025
faith is faith in a crucified
Messiah who's then raised by

00:03:14.025 --> 00:03:16.073
God,
and it's faith in Christ that's

00:03:16.073 --> 00:03:17.938
the foundation of Christianity
not,

00:03:17.938 --> 00:03:22.157
some people might say,
Jesus of Nazareth's own

00:03:22.157 --> 00:03:24.970
faithfulness to God himself.
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.528
All of these things,
people have said,

00:03:27.528 --> 00:03:31.680
makes Paul more the founder of
Christianity then Jesus is.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.485
In fact, though,
Paul has been read in so many

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:38.039
different ways throughout the
last 2,000 years that people

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.410
have even compared him to
Proteus.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.240
Does anybody remember the
Homeric figure of Proteus from

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.470
the Odyssey?
 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.979
Anybody know?
 

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.837
Proteus is this guy that is
captured by Odysseus and his

00:03:51.837 --> 00:03:53.827
sailors,
and they're trying to get a

00:03:53.827 --> 00:03:56.605
secret out of him,
so they hold onto him and he

00:03:56.605 --> 00:03:58.550
turns into different things.
 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.038
He turns into different animals
and he turns--

00:04:01.038 --> 00:04:05.111
and they keep holding onto him
until he finally turns back into

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:09.120
a man and then they can force
him to give him their secret.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.790
Wayne Meeks,
my predecessor in the chair I

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.918
occupy here at Yale,
published a book in which--it's

00:04:14.918 --> 00:04:16.810
just come out in a second
edition,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.432
in which he talks about the
Apostle Paul and how he's been

00:04:19.432 --> 00:04:20.949
represented throughout history.
 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.026
In his essay,
he calls Paul the Protean

00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:28.077
Apostle;
because Paul himself even says,

00:04:28.077 --> 00:04:31.266
"I have become all things
to all people,"

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:32.670
in 1 Corinthians 9.
 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.370
Is Paul the kind of person who
everybody makes out of him

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.300
whatever they want to make out
of him?

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.526
He turns into different kinds
of things according to who's

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:41.952
looking at him,
and that's exactly the way Paul

00:04:41.952 --> 00:04:44.788
has come across in many
different aspects of Western

00:04:44.788 --> 00:04:45.399
history.
 

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:47.148
The early church,
for example,

00:04:47.148 --> 00:04:50.583
didn't think of Paul as being
so much the great theologian

00:04:50.583 --> 00:04:54.079
that sometimes he became in
later Christian tradition.

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:57.163
They certainly didn't think of
him as sort of the best

00:04:57.163 --> 00:05:00.536
Protestant Apostle as he would
become for Lutherans and for

00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:01.410
Calvinists.
 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.139
Paul was mainly known as a
martyr.

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.476
In the early church when you
see Paul depicted in art and in

00:05:07.476 --> 00:05:10.625
literature,
most often he's not depicted so

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:15.016
much as this great theologian,
he's depicted as the great

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:18.028
martyr, whose head was cut off
in Rome.

00:05:18.028 --> 00:05:21.398
So the great martyr apostle is
the early church's way of

00:05:21.398 --> 00:05:22.439
looking at him.
 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.156
Then St.
 

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:27.639
Augustine, and then following
him Martin Luther,

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.863
they saw in Paul someone who
was more like their own sort of

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:33.540
psychological way of thinking
about themselves.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.684
They saw Paul as this guy who
was really trying to be

00:05:36.684 --> 00:05:37.410
righteous.
 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.029
Luther tried to do everything,
he was a Catholic monk,

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:42.879
and so he was trying to do all
the kind of things that the

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:46.021
Catholic Church expected,
and he just became crushed

00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:48.769
under all the requirements of
doctrine,

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:51.589
and ethics, and Catholic
requirements.

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.767
He finally--he was--he felt
like I have to be perfect in

00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:58.177
order to be acceptable to God
but no matter how much I try I

00:05:58.177 --> 00:06:00.173
can't do it,
I can't keep the law,

00:06:00.173 --> 00:06:02.009
I can't keep the church's
teachings,

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:03.689
I'm this total moral failure.
 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.173
And so he read Paul as this
person who experienced his life

00:06:07.173 --> 00:06:10.598
as trying to live up to the
requirements of God which they

00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:13.976
interpreted as the law,
and just found out you couldn't

00:06:13.976 --> 00:06:14.360
do it.
 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.384
This expressed for Luther a
sort of universal human

00:06:17.384 --> 00:06:21.016
experience that all of us feel
when we try to live up to very

00:06:21.016 --> 00:06:23.680
demanding ethical and moral
guidelines,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.209
and we find out we can't.
 

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:28.822
We always fall short of what
God wants us to do,

00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:32.129
none of us is perfect,
we're all sinners.

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.584
This idea that Paul represented
this psychological struggling

00:06:36.584 --> 00:06:40.595
figure of trying to be righteous
and trying to earn his

00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:42.600
righteousness by works.
 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.440
And then all of a sudden Luther
discovers,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.238
when he read Galatians and
Romans, wait we're saved by

00:06:47.238 --> 00:06:49.213
faith apart--
we're saved by grace through

00:06:49.213 --> 00:06:51.589
faith apart from works,
therefore works don't matter,

00:06:51.589 --> 00:06:53.959
therefore all the Roman
Catholic requirements that we

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:55.543
have to do this,
and that, and that,

00:06:55.543 --> 00:06:56.959
that's not where salvation
comes from,

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:58.940
it comes from simply your faith.
 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.158
This Paul then became the
Paul--not the ancient Christian

00:07:03.158 --> 00:07:07.302
martyr Apostle so much but the
Paul of the psychological

00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:11.711
discovery that true Gospel is,
you're saved by grace through

00:07:11.711 --> 00:07:12.139
faith.
 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:15.336
It's nothing you can do,
and therefore works of the law

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:17.230
don't matter with you and God.
 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.846
The great Lutheran Protestant
Paul then becomes invented as

00:07:20.846 --> 00:07:23.778
this man who had this
psychological struggle and

00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:27.334
through this psychological
struggle broke out through that

00:07:27.334 --> 00:07:30.899
into this discovery of grace,
the grace of God.

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:34.829
That became this anguished
guilt ridden Paul who discovers

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:39.244
Grace and that's been one of the
main figure of Paul that you get

00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:43.519
in Protestantism ever since
Martin Luther and John Calvin.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:45.620
As I said, there are other
people,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.273
even in the modern--the
nineteenth and twentieth

00:07:47.273 --> 00:07:48.865
century,
who became more interested

00:07:48.865 --> 00:07:50.579
history and they noticed that
Paul,

00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:54.862
that Paul's letters don't sound
like what you get from Jesus in

00:07:54.862 --> 00:07:55.829
the Gospels.
 

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:58.180
They just sound like different
kinds of stuff.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.360
Jesus was preaching the Kingdom
of God was going to come.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:08.670
Paul preaches Jesus as the
King, Jesus as the Messiah.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.170
In fact, people have said the
message of Jesus was about God

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:13.240
and the Kingdom.
 

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.559
By the time you get to Paul,
Paul's message is about Jesus

00:08:16.559 --> 00:08:20.553
himself,
so this shift of the proclaimer

00:08:20.553 --> 00:08:23.178
Jesus,
becoming the proclaimed in

00:08:23.178 --> 00:08:26.360
Paul, that is Jesus being
proclaimed by Paul,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.420
is one of the shifts that
historians noticed in the

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.778
nineteenth-- twentieth century.
 

00:08:29.778 --> 00:08:33.003
All of this stuff sort of--are
different ways of figuring Paul

00:08:33.003 --> 00:08:33.690
in history.
 

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.941
In fact, one of the ways that
people talked about this was

00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:42.490
Paul was actually the corrupter
of the noble pristine religion

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.460
of Jesus.
 

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.298
Jesus was a great moral teacher;
he didn't care about all these

00:08:47.298 --> 00:08:50.528
Christian doctrines about the
trinity, and about hell and

00:08:50.528 --> 00:08:52.720
heaven, and all this kind of
stuff.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.850
Jesus was just saying things
like, consider the lilies of the

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.791
field,
how they grow,

00:08:58.791 --> 00:09:02.379
they toil not,
neither do they spin,

00:09:02.379 --> 00:09:06.371
and yet I say that it's Solomon
in all his glory was not arrayed

00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:07.639
like one of these.
 

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:10.048
I should be in a movie, right?
 

00:09:10.048 --> 00:09:14.980
"Jesus of Nazareth at
Yale."

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.652
Jesus comes across sometimes as
being this moral teacher who's

00:09:18.652 --> 00:09:21.903
floating around on boats in the
sea of Galilee with his

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:25.398
disciples saying things,
consider the sparrow,

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:28.798
and then Paul comes along,
according to this reading,

00:09:28.798 --> 00:09:31.058
and he turns all that into this
stuff about doctrine,

00:09:31.058 --> 00:09:34.259
and hell, and heaven,
and doing the right thing,

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:35.850
and God's condemnation.
 

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.509
So for these kinds of people
Paul was actually the founder of

00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:42.682
Christianity because he
destroyed the kind of message

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:44.940
that the historical Jesus
taught.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.024
This is what you get from
someone like Friedrich

00:09:48.024 --> 00:09:52.158
Nietzsche, who wasn't that crazy
about Jesus but he really hated

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:52.750
Paul.
 

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:56.802
So Nietzsche said this,
this is Paul the corruptor of

00:09:56.802 --> 00:10:00.308
Jesus' religion,
this is that kind of Paul.

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.110
"The glad tidings,"
that is the Gospel,

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.549
the good news,
"were followed closely by

00:10:06.549 --> 00:10:09.755
the absolutely worst tidings,
those of St.

00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:10.460
Paul.
 

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:14.559
Paul is in the incarnation of a
type which is the reverse of

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:16.019
that of the Savior.
 

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:21.980
He is a genius in hatred in the
standpoint of hatred."

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:25.778
Nietzsche goes on to talk about
Paul "by making the heroic

00:10:25.778 --> 00:10:29.514
but unfortunate death of Jesus
into a sacrifice for sin,"

00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:32.639
which is what Nietzsche thought
Paul had done,

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:36.240
"nailed Christ to his
cross."

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.129
That's what Nietzsche says
about Paul.

00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:42.046
The cross was Paul's invention
for Christianity and that what's

00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:43.308
made Christianity.
 

00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:46.779
Or George Bernard Shaw,
he has a great thing.

00:10:46.779 --> 00:10:49.070
When I was a high school kid,
remember I told you about this.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.576
I grew up in this very
conservative church in Texas and

00:10:51.576 --> 00:10:53.480
I went to this big public high
school,

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.426
and I mean I had gone to Sunday
school my whole life and I

00:10:56.426 --> 00:10:58.389
wasn't very well read in
literature.

00:10:58.389 --> 00:11:01.580
Well in high school we were
reading some plays by George

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.450
Bernard Shaw.
 

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.113
We were assigned,
I think, mainly the play and I

00:11:05.113 --> 00:11:08.570
was flipping through a bunch of
George Bernard Shaw stuff,

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:09.998
and I came across
"Androcles and the

00:11:09.998 --> 00:11:12.070
Lion," I think was the name
of the play about the--

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.280
Androcles is the young man who
finds the lion with a thorn in

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.408
his paw,
he pulls the thorn out of the

00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:19.322
lion's paw,
and then the lion's very

00:11:19.322 --> 00:11:22.346
grateful and then years,
years, years later Androcles

00:11:22.346 --> 00:11:25.740
becomes a Christian and he's
thrown into the lions in the

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.378
Roman Coliseum and it just so
happens that the lion whose paw

00:11:29.378 --> 00:11:32.470
he cured is the one who's
supposed to eat him.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.011
Of course the lion comes up and
recognizes, and licks him,

00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:35.860
and he saves him.
 

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.355
And so "Androcles and the
lion" is this story about

00:11:38.355 --> 00:11:40.308
the Christian martyr who's saved
by the lion.

00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:44.283
Well that's the play,
but Shaw always appended these

00:11:44.283 --> 00:11:47.399
wonderful introductions to his
plays,

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:50.327
and sometimes the introductions
are more interesting than the

00:11:50.327 --> 00:11:52.620
plays themselves because this is
where Shaw,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.669
who was a wonderful atheist in
the beginning of the twentieth

00:11:55.669 --> 00:11:58.195
century,
where he just lets loose and he

00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:01.428
just slams all kinds of
political stuff but a lot of

00:12:01.428 --> 00:12:02.190
religion.
 

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:03.710
He just really doesn't like
religion.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:08.450
I remember coming across this
in a library or something,

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.908
and here I was this pious
little Protestant boy,

00:12:10.908 --> 00:12:12.649
growing up in my conservative
little church,

00:12:12.649 --> 00:12:16.181
and here was this guy very,
very smart in this introduction

00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:19.164
to Androcles and the lion
explaining to me how bad

00:12:19.164 --> 00:12:23.000
Christianity was really and how
Paul had screwed the whole thing

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.549
up.
 

00:12:23.549 --> 00:12:26.350
It kind of blew my mind.
 

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.745
It took me days to get over
this, but George Bernard Shaw

00:12:30.745 --> 00:12:34.703
said this about Paul,
"No sooner had Jesus

00:12:34.703 --> 00:12:39.267
knocked over the dragon of
superstition than Paul boldly

00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:44.080
set it up on its legs again in
the name of Jesus."

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.495
Paul is the one who makes
Jesus' movement superstitious or

00:12:48.495 --> 00:12:52.442
here he said this also,
"Paul is the true head and

00:12:52.442 --> 00:12:57.460
founder of our reformed church,
as Peter is of the Roman church.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:02.970
The followers of Paul and Peter
made Christendom while the

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.158
Nazarenes were wiped out."
 

00:13:06.158 --> 00:13:09.006
The religion of Jesus,
according to Shaw,

00:13:09.006 --> 00:13:13.065
disappeared from the earth,
and all that we were left with

00:13:13.065 --> 00:13:15.700
is this shell called
Christendom.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.678
So all those things are Paul.
 

00:13:17.678 --> 00:13:21.092
We're going to talk about--for
the next few days we're going to

00:13:21.092 --> 00:13:23.871
talk about Paul,
both the authentic letters he

00:13:23.871 --> 00:13:25.326
wrote,
we're going to try to figure

00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:27.191
out who he was,
and then we're going to talk

00:13:27.191 --> 00:13:30.006
about how he was depicted by his
own followers in the Bible and

00:13:30.006 --> 00:13:32.460
then by some of his followers
outside of the Bible.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.080
What does Paul tell us about
himself?

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.260
There are some important
things, but there are just a

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.100
couple of details.
 

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:44.580
One, in Philippians 3:5-6,
Paul tells us that he was of

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.038
the tribe of Benjamin,
so he even knows his tribal

00:13:50.038 --> 00:13:54.317
identity as a Jew,
he was a Pharisee--now that

00:13:54.317 --> 00:13:56.408
surprises some people.
 

00:13:56.408 --> 00:13:59.208
In fact Paul doesn't ever say,
I used to be a Pharisee but I'm

00:13:59.208 --> 00:14:01.778
no longer, he basically just
calls himself a Pharisee.

00:14:01.778 --> 00:14:07.374
In fact Paul's the one Pharisee
from pre-70 Judaism that we know

00:14:07.374 --> 00:14:09.149
much about at all.
 

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:11.493
We don't know--a lot of the
rabbis of the Pharisees appear

00:14:11.493 --> 00:14:13.878
in rabbinic documents but those
come from hundreds of years

00:14:13.878 --> 00:14:14.288
later.
 

00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:17.455
Paul's one person who calls
himself a Pharisee and whose

00:14:17.455 --> 00:14:20.480
writings we actually possess;
so Paul calls himself a

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.019
Pharisee.
 

00:14:21.019 --> 00:14:24.116
He says that he was a
persecutor of the church before

00:14:24.116 --> 00:14:27.572
he became a follower of Jesus,
and he implies that this was

00:14:27.572 --> 00:14:29.240
out of zeal for the law.
 

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.370
Paul started off a very law
abiding,

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:37.873
in fact zealous for the law
Jew, even to the point of being

00:14:37.873 --> 00:14:40.947
a Pharisee,
and he says in Philippians that

00:14:40.947 --> 00:14:43.000
he was righteous under the law.
 

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.288
Now, this is one of the reasons
that scholars in the last part

00:14:46.288 --> 00:14:49.633
of the twentieth century started
questioning this more Lutheran

00:14:49.633 --> 00:14:52.597
idea that Paul came to his
knowledge of grace because he

00:14:52.597 --> 00:14:54.808
felt like he couldn't keep the
law.

00:14:54.808 --> 00:14:56.904
I've tried to keep the law,
I just can't keep the law,

00:14:56.904 --> 00:14:58.168
I've tried I just can't do it.
 

00:14:58.168 --> 00:15:01.801
Well he tells us in Philippians
that he actually was pretty

00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:05.232
righteous with the law,
so maybe Paul didn't have such

00:15:05.232 --> 00:15:08.240
a problem with the law after all
for that reason.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.580
Those are the things he tells
us in Philippians.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.868
In Galatians 5:11 he also says
at one point,

00:15:13.868 --> 00:15:17.538
"Am I still preaching
circumcision?"

00:15:17.538 --> 00:15:21.120
Now that just kind of hangs
there, "am I still

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.340
preaching circumcision?"
 

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.347
The one thing that at least
tells us is that Paul,

00:15:26.347 --> 00:15:28.620
at one time,
preached circumcision.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.851
Was that maybe the reason that
he was persecuting these

00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:33.110
followers of Jesus?
 

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.809
That some of them were not
preaching circumcision.

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:37.490
Well we don't know.
 

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.335
Now there are several other
things about Paul that we don't

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:43.375
get from his letters but that if
you pick up most books on Paul

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:46.418
nowadays at the bookstore they'd
probably tell you these things

00:15:46.418 --> 00:15:49.315
about Paul's biography,
but these are things that we

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:51.298
only find in the Acts of the
Apostles.

00:15:51.298 --> 00:15:54.184
As I've tried to get you to
see, there are a lot of things

00:15:54.184 --> 00:15:56.869
in the Acts of the Apostles that
we should doubt their

00:15:56.869 --> 00:15:58.916
historicity,
especially when it comes to

00:15:58.916 --> 00:15:59.178
Paul.
 

00:15:59.178 --> 00:16:02.375
Some of the things about Paul
that people think they know

00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:05.399
about Paul as historical facts
only come from Acts.

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:06.580
What are those?
 

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:11.245
One, he was brought up and
educated in Jerusalem at the

00:16:11.245 --> 00:16:15.046
feet of Gamaliel,
a very famous first century

00:16:15.046 --> 00:16:15.908
rabbi.
 

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:19.509
Well it's only in Acts that
Paul says that about himself.

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:23.028
Is this something that Luke
kind of made up or put in there,

00:16:23.028 --> 00:16:24.399
or part of tradition?
 

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:28.080
His original name was Saul,
according to Acts.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.350
Paul never tells us that
himself.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.629
It's not too unlikely,
a lot of Jews then,

00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:37.639
as Jews now,
might have two separate names,

00:16:37.639 --> 00:16:40.687
sort of their American name and
then their Israeli name or

00:16:40.687 --> 00:16:42.740
something;
their Hebrew name and their

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.779
English name,
so maybe Paul did have two

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:45.250
names.
 

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.678
But he never calls himself Saul
in his letters;

00:16:47.678 --> 00:16:50.009
that's a name that he's given
in Acts.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:53.894
He also says in Acts that he's
a Roman citizen and that he was

00:16:53.894 --> 00:16:55.360
born a Roman citizen.
 

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.457
That's a pretty impressive
thing for a Jew in the eastern

00:16:58.457 --> 00:17:01.278
part of the Mediterranean to be
a Roman citizen,

00:17:01.278 --> 00:17:04.815
and in the first part of the
first century that would have

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:06.180
been fairly unusual.
 

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.298
But Paul claims that in Acts,
but only in Acts.

00:17:10.298 --> 00:17:15.680
In Acts Paul is portrayed as
speaking Hebrew fluently.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.768
He gets up in Jerusalem and
gives whole long speeches in

00:17:18.768 --> 00:17:20.587
Hebrew,
it may mean Aramaic,

00:17:20.587 --> 00:17:24.236
but sometimes in ancient Greek
texts they'll say Hebrew and

00:17:24.236 --> 00:17:28.200
what we think they probably were
talking about was Aramaic,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.979
which is kind of a dialogue
of--dialect of Hebrew and

00:17:30.979 --> 00:17:31.460
Syriac.
 

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.308
Paul seems to be speaking
Hebrew in Acts.

00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:38.545
Paul never in his letters gives
us any indication that he spoke

00:17:38.545 --> 00:17:39.160
Hebrew.
 

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.930
Did he speak Hebrew?
 

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.009
I would say Greek at least
seems to be his first language,

00:17:46.009 --> 00:17:50.519
and we don't have any direct
indication that he spoke Hebrew.

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:54.202
Then one of the things that's
important for us today:

00:17:54.202 --> 00:17:57.270
according to Acts,
Paul's normal modus

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.871
operandi,
his way of operating,

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:03.930
was to go to a town and go to
the synagogue first and,

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:06.210
only after he was rejected in
the synagogue,

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.049
would he then go preach to the
Gentiles.

00:18:08.049 --> 00:18:08.950
Do you remember?
 

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.338
This goes along with that Acts
theme that we talked about,

00:18:11.338 --> 00:18:13.880
to the Jew first and then to
the Greeks,

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.373
so look with me because we're
going to talk about 1

00:18:16.373 --> 00:18:17.618
Thessalonians in a bit.
 

00:18:17.618 --> 00:18:22.210
Acts 17 gives the account of
when Paul first went to the

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:25.798
Thessalonica,
at least according to Acts.

00:18:25.798 --> 00:18:30.478
Now Thessalonica is an
important Roman city in

00:18:30.478 --> 00:18:33.618
Macedonia,
that is the home area of

00:18:33.618 --> 00:18:36.548
Alexander the Great,
and Philip his father,

00:18:36.548 --> 00:18:39.828
which is now considered by the
Romans sort of part of--

00:18:39.828 --> 00:18:43.386
mainly sort of the area that's
ruled also with Achaia or

00:18:43.386 --> 00:18:43.970
Greece.
 

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:47.594
It's a Greek speaking area but
Thessalonica is a Roman kind of

00:18:47.594 --> 00:18:50.042
city,
it's Romanized to some extent,

00:18:50.042 --> 00:18:53.990
it's right on a major highway
running east to west so it's an

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.240
important place.
 

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.838
Here's the way Acts describes
Paul's getting to Thessalonica.

00:18:58.838 --> 00:19:00.840
Now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to read this carefully

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.910
because we're going to then go
to 1 Thessalonians and say,

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.876
can we confirm any of the Acts
material from Paul's own

00:19:06.876 --> 00:19:10.328
description about what happened
Thessalonica?

00:19:10.328 --> 00:19:13.644
After Paul and Silas [this is
Acts 17:1]

00:19:13.644 --> 00:19:17.640
had passed through Amphipolis
and Apollonia,

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.528
they came to Thessalonica where
there was a synagogue of the

00:19:21.528 --> 00:19:21.990
Jews.
 

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:25.440
And Paul went in,
as was his custom,

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.846
and on three Sabbath days
argued with them from the

00:19:28.846 --> 00:19:31.464
scriptures,
explaining and proving that it

00:19:31.464 --> 00:19:35.017
was necessary for the Messiah to
suffer and to rise from the dead

00:19:35.017 --> 00:19:37.400
and saying,
"This is the Messiah,

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.346
the Christ, Jesus,
whom I am proclaiming to

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:41.190
you."
 

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.932
Some of them were persuaded and
joined Paul and Silas,

00:19:44.932 --> 00:19:47.759
as did a great many of the
devout Greeks,

00:19:47.759 --> 00:19:50.019
and not a few leading women.
 

00:19:50.019 --> 00:19:54.657
Luke likes that phrase,
he likes to say that a few

00:19:54.657 --> 00:19:59.960
leading women also were
converted in different places.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.578
It's more than one place he
does this.

00:20:01.578 --> 00:20:06.617
But the Jews [we see that turn
that we've often seen in Acts]

00:20:06.617 --> 00:20:09.195
became jealous,
and with the help of some

00:20:09.195 --> 00:20:12.742
ruffians in the marketplaces,
they formed a mob and set the

00:20:12.742 --> 00:20:14.200
city in an uproar.
 

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.904
While they were searching for
Paul and Silas to bring them out

00:20:17.904 --> 00:20:20.759
to the assembly,
they attacked Jason's house.

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:23.865
When they could not find them
they dragged Jason and some

00:20:23.865 --> 00:20:26.640
believers before the city
authorities shouting,

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:29.338
"These people who have
been turning the world upside

00:20:29.338 --> 00:20:32.320
down have come here also,
and Jason has entertained them

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.920
as guests.
 

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.690
They are all acting contrary to
the decrees of the emperor,

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:38.269
saying that there is another
king named Jesus."

00:20:38.269 --> 00:20:41.328
The people and the city
officials were disturbed when

00:20:41.328 --> 00:20:43.976
they heard this,
and after they had taken bail

00:20:43.976 --> 00:20:46.798
from Jason and the others,
they let them go.

00:20:46.798 --> 00:20:50.246
That very night the believers
sent Paul and Silas off to

00:20:50.246 --> 00:20:53.442
Berea, and when they arrived
they went to the Jewish

00:20:53.442 --> 00:20:54.318
synagogue.
 

00:20:54.318 --> 00:20:56.000
They're arrested,
they have to post bail,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.190
and then during the night they
send them off,

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.700
get them out of out,
and they go to Berea,

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.740
and again, Paul and Silas go
first to the synagogue.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:07.021
That's the account from Acts,
now let's look though at 1

00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:10.449
Thessalonians,
and let's compare a few things

00:21:10.449 --> 00:21:11.150
here.
 

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.875
First, we're going to ask,
what does 1 Thessalonians tell

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:18.068
us about several things.
 

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:22.569
How did Paul work as a
missionary?

00:21:22.569 --> 00:21:23.890
How did he do this?
 

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:28.523
He was going around trying to
convince Gentiles to accept that

00:21:28.523 --> 00:21:31.364
Jesus of Nazareth,
this guy they had never heard

00:21:31.364 --> 00:21:34.031
of before,
who had been executed by the

00:21:34.031 --> 00:21:38.259
Romans way off in a corner of
the world in Jerusalem,

00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:41.140
that this guy was not only the
new king of the Jews,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.410
he had been raised from the
dead and made king of the Jews,

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.769
but that now he was going to be
king of the whole world,

00:21:46.769 --> 00:21:49.598
and that even Gentiles should
be loyal to him,

00:21:49.598 --> 00:21:53.230
and they should all become
loyal to the God of Israel,

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.806
precisely because the God of
Israel had raised this Jesus guy

00:21:56.806 --> 00:21:59.936
from the dead,
and therefore he demanded faith

00:21:59.936 --> 00:22:03.010
and adherence,
and worship from all the world,

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:03.970
even Gentiles.
 

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.440
That's what he's doing,
he's going around to different

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.048
towns and he's trying to plant
little house churches,

00:22:09.048 --> 00:22:12.116
little cell groups in the
different cities of the Greeks

00:22:12.116 --> 00:22:13.009
where he goes.
 

00:22:13.009 --> 00:22:15.849
Here's what he talks about in 1
Thessalonians.

00:22:15.849 --> 00:22:17.868
He gives this long thanksgiving.
 

00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:21.882
Paul, Silvanus [Silvanus is the
Latinized name of Silas so we're

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:25.576
talking about the same person
that Acts called Silas called

00:22:25.576 --> 00:22:28.670
Silvanus here],
and Timothy to the church of

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.028
the Thessalonians,
and God the Father and the Lord

00:22:31.028 --> 00:22:32.828
Jesus Christ,
grace to you and peace.

00:22:32.828 --> 00:22:35.615
We always give thanks to God
[and then he goes into this long

00:22:35.615 --> 00:22:38.261
thanksgiving about their faith]
because our message of the

00:22:38.261 --> 00:22:41.001
Gospel came to you not only in
word but also in the power of

00:22:41.001 --> 00:22:43.365
the Holy Spirit,
full conviction just as you

00:22:43.365 --> 00:22:45.430
know what kind of persons we
preach among.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.553
You became imitators of us in
the Lord in spite of

00:22:48.553 --> 00:22:52.250
persecutions you received the
word with joy inspired by the

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.269
Holy Spirit.
 

00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:56.800
You became an example to all
the believers in Macedonia and

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.348
Achaia.
 

00:22:57.348 --> 00:23:00.617
[Achaia refers then to the main
part of Greece where Athens of

00:23:00.617 --> 00:23:03.351
course is and Corinth.]
For the word of the Lord had

00:23:03.351 --> 00:23:06.618
sounded forth from you not only
in Macedonia and Achaia,

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:09.160
but in every place your faith
in God has become known,

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.410
so that we have no need to
speak about it.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:15.487
[Now here's the report that
they're getting and this has a

00:23:15.487 --> 00:23:18.490
few clues.]
For the people of those regions

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:20.779
[that is of Macedonia and
Achaia]

00:23:20.779 --> 00:23:25.070
report about us what kind of
welcome we had among you and how

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:30.048
you turned to God from idols,
to serve a living and true God

00:23:30.048 --> 00:23:32.910
and to wait for his Son from
heaven,

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.250
whom he raised from the dead,
Jesus,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.548
who rescues us from the wrath
that is coming.

00:23:38.548 --> 00:23:41.915
That basically sounds like a
little nutshell of what Paul

00:23:41.915 --> 00:23:43.660
must have preached to them.
 

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.661
There's a wrath coming,
you're going to be destroyed in

00:23:46.661 --> 00:23:49.605
that wrath,
you can be rescued from that

00:23:49.605 --> 00:23:53.953
wrath if you turn to this guy,
Jesus, that we tell you about,

00:23:53.953 --> 00:23:57.703
who's the Son of God and God
raised him from the dead and you

00:23:57.703 --> 00:24:01.578
will wait for him to come from
heaven and he'll rescue you.

00:24:01.578 --> 00:24:04.970
That's kind of the nutshell of
this message.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:07.618
Notice, who is Paul talking to
here?

00:24:07.618 --> 00:24:11.140
What kind of people were they
before they became followers of

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.609
Jesus?
 

00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:15.789
Were they Jews?
 

00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:18.078
Is Paul talking to Jews?
 

00:24:18.078 --> 00:24:20.567
This is not a trick question,
it's right there in front of

00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:20.828
you.
 

00:24:20.828 --> 00:24:23.432
He's talking to Gentiles
because he says,

00:24:23.432 --> 00:24:26.948
"You turned from gods to
serve the living and true

00:24:26.948 --> 00:24:27.858
God."
 

00:24:27.858 --> 00:24:31.056
So these are clearly Gentiles
he's addressing so that's one

00:24:31.056 --> 00:24:34.086
clue about this is that Paul is
addressing Gentiles in 1

00:24:34.086 --> 00:24:35.078
Thessalonians.
 

00:24:35.078 --> 00:24:38.876
Look at Chapter 2:9,
he gives us another little

00:24:38.876 --> 00:24:43.170
clue, "You remember our
labor and toil."

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.022
Now my translation,
I'm using the New Revised

00:24:46.022 --> 00:24:48.857
Standard Version,
and in order--as I said before,

00:24:48.857 --> 00:24:50.990
in order to make this
translation usable for

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.818
liturgical use in churches
they've actually made inclusive

00:24:53.818 --> 00:24:55.108
some of the language.
 

00:24:55.108 --> 00:24:58.124
It says--the Greek says,
"You remember our labor

00:24:58.124 --> 00:24:59.690
and toil, brothers."
 

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.249
My English translation says,
"brothers and

00:25:02.249 --> 00:25:04.307
sisters,"
but the Greek just says

00:25:04.307 --> 00:25:07.035
adelphoi, which means
"brothers,"

00:25:07.035 --> 00:25:10.605
it can include women sometimes,
so it's sort of like the word

00:25:10.605 --> 00:25:12.761
"men"
in older English when it was

00:25:12.761 --> 00:25:14.868
supposed to include both women
and men.

00:25:14.868 --> 00:25:17.930
The Greek adelphoi can
include women but it's just the

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.070
masculine Greek word,
"brothers,"

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.500
here that's in the text.
 

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.538
That's not just a linguistic
point--

00:25:23.538 --> 00:25:26.747
I'm going to return to that
later because I'm going to argue

00:25:26.747 --> 00:25:30.172
that there's something important
about this fact that Paul seems

00:25:30.172 --> 00:25:32.509
to address only men in 1
Thessalonians.

00:25:32.509 --> 00:25:36.509
You remember our labor and
toil, brothers.

00:25:36.509 --> 00:25:39.513
We worked night and day so that
we might not burden any of you

00:25:39.513 --> 00:25:41.829
while we proclaimed to you the
Gospel of God.

00:25:41.829 --> 00:25:44.108
You are witnesses and God also.
 

00:25:44.108 --> 00:25:46.670
Now one of the things to
notice, notice what Paul's

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.487
saying, he's saying that they
themselves practice manual

00:25:49.487 --> 00:25:50.000
labor.
 

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.634
One of the things that Paul
wants to insist is that he

00:25:52.634 --> 00:25:55.019
didn't--he and Silas,
and Timothy didn't live off

00:25:55.019 --> 00:25:56.808
handouts from the Thessalonians.
 

00:25:56.808 --> 00:25:59.346
He's insisting,
we owned--we earned our own

00:25:59.346 --> 00:26:01.877
keep,
we practiced our own trade,

00:26:01.877 --> 00:26:04.990
what exactly was Paul's trade
is again--

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.250
Acts calls him a leather worker
or a tent maker.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.769
The word there in Greek is not
exactly clear,

00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:12.358
but some people have said that
if that Acts account is true,

00:26:12.358 --> 00:26:14.278
then Paul may have been the
kind of person--

00:26:14.278 --> 00:26:16.490
there was not a lot of tents
you made for city dwellers,

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.190
some, but they made awnings
that would go--

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:21.471
these leather type and canvas
awnings that would go in front

00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:23.289
of shops and everything to keep
the sun off,

00:26:23.289 --> 00:26:24.740
and they did make tents.
 

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.228
So if that's true and Paul was
a tent maker or a leather

00:26:27.228 --> 00:26:29.535
worker, that's the kind of thing
he would have made,

00:26:29.535 --> 00:26:31.210
but remember that's only in
Acts.

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:34.525
At least here we get a definite
indication from his own letters

00:26:34.525 --> 00:26:37.680
that Paul was a manual laborer,
he worked with his hands.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.720
He doesn't tell us exactly in
his letters what he did.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.460
We did night and day so we
wouldn't burden you.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.887
You are witnesses in God also,
how pure, upright,

00:26:46.887 --> 00:26:49.568
and blameless our conduct was
toward you believers.

00:26:49.568 --> 00:26:52.711
As you know we dealt with each
one like a father with his

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:53.328
children.
 

00:26:53.328 --> 00:26:56.750
They practiced manual labor
when they were there.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:02.134
Now look at verse 14,2:14:
For you, brothers,

00:27:02.134 --> 00:27:06.141
became imitators of the
churches of God in Christ Jesus

00:27:06.141 --> 00:27:07.700
that are in Judea.
 

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.448
[They're in Macedonia he's
talking about the churches also

00:27:11.448 --> 00:27:13.750
in Judea.]
For you suffered the same

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.960
things from your own compatriots
as they did from the Jews,

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.809
who killed both the Lord Jesus
and the prophets,

00:27:19.809 --> 00:27:21.528
and drove us out.
 

00:27:21.528 --> 00:27:24.009
That displeased God and opposed
everyone by hindering us from

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:26.200
speaking to the Gentiles so that
they may be saved.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.057
Thus they have been constantly
filling up the measure of their

00:27:29.057 --> 00:27:31.400
sins but God's wrath has
overtaken them at last.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:35.973
Now what's going on here is at
least that Paul is saying you

00:27:35.973 --> 00:27:39.958
people in Thessalonica,
you received persecution just

00:27:39.958 --> 00:27:42.808
like the followers of Jesus did
in Judea.

00:27:42.808 --> 00:27:47.654
Who is persecuting these
followers of Jesus in

00:27:47.654 --> 00:27:49.269
Thessalonica?
 

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:51.460
Pardon?
 

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.912
Compatriots,
in other words,

00:27:53.912 --> 00:27:54.730
Greeks.
 

00:27:54.730 --> 00:27:59.346
They're not being persecuted by
Jews, they're being persecuted

00:27:59.346 --> 00:28:01.240
by their fellow Greeks.
 

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.403
They're experiencing
persecution too once they've

00:28:04.403 --> 00:28:07.038
decided to follow this Jewish
Messiah.

00:28:07.038 --> 00:28:09.854
They're not experiencing
persecution from Jews,

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:12.180
they're experiencing it from
Greeks.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.817
Now you put all that together,
there is no mention of Jews

00:28:16.817 --> 00:28:19.828
anywhere in 1 Thessalonians at
all.

00:28:19.828 --> 00:28:23.088
In other words,
it's pretty clear that Paul is

00:28:23.088 --> 00:28:27.000
addressing a church that's
composed of all Gentiles.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.500
They became followers of Jesus
by turning away from idols.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.670
They weren't Jews.
 

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.410
They were also experiencing
persecution as the churches in

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.150
Judea but they don't experience
persecution from Jews,

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.630
they're experiencing
persecution from Gentiles,

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:41.670
their own neighbors.
 

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.308
Now notice how this doesn't fit
the narrative of Acts.

00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:47.686
According to Acts,
Paul goes first to the

00:28:47.686 --> 00:28:49.980
synagogue,
he preaches to the Jews,

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.960
some of them believe including
leading women,

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.940
and he forms the nucleus of his
group with Jews,

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.848
and then he adds onto that
nucleus Gentiles.

00:28:59.848 --> 00:29:02.671
That doesn't seem to fit 1
Thessalonians where there's no

00:29:02.671 --> 00:29:03.880
Jews mentioned at all.
 

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.371
The only people he addresses
are Gentiles,

00:29:06.371 --> 00:29:09.044
and he says they were
persecuted not by Jews,

00:29:09.044 --> 00:29:11.900
as is in the case in Acts,
but by Gentiles.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:15.434
Again Paul's letters seem to
provide a somewhat different

00:29:15.434 --> 00:29:19.032
picture than we got in Acts,
and it's easy to see how Acts

00:29:19.032 --> 00:29:21.180
told the story the way it did.
 

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.500
Remember, over and over,
the Acts of the Apostles

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.240
presents Paul in the same
pattern.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.269
All the people in Acts go to
the Jews first,

00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:30.170
they preach in synagogues
first, city after city,

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.509
they're rejected by the Jews or
at least by most of them,

00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:34.059
and then they go to the
Gentiles later,

00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:35.980
so it's schematic in Acts.
 

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.900
In 1 Thessalonians we don't
have a schematic history,

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:41.269
we probably have a much better
idea of what actually happened,

00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:44.034
which was that Paul founded
this church with Gentile

00:29:44.034 --> 00:29:46.691
believers and when they
experienced persecution it

00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:49.509
wasn't from the Romans and it
wasn't from Jews,

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:50.838
it was from their neighbors.
 

00:29:50.838 --> 00:29:53.683
We're going to come back to 1
Thessalonians but that's just

00:29:53.683 --> 00:29:56.577
basically the set up that when
we look at what's going on in

00:29:56.577 --> 00:29:58.718
Thessalonica,
we need to look at 1

00:29:58.718 --> 00:30:02.808
Thessalonians and not depend on
Acts again to tell us the story.

00:30:02.808 --> 00:30:07.210
Any question about that before
I go on?

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:13.116
Okay, other things about Paul,
Paul has this many letters in

00:30:13.116 --> 00:30:15.118
the New Testament.
 

00:30:15.118 --> 00:30:18.837
As you've been reading in your
textbook you've already noticed

00:30:18.837 --> 00:30:22.130
that Bart Ehrman talks about the
undisputed letters.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.279
This just means these are the
letters that almost all scholars

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:26.519
will agree Paul wrote.
 

00:30:26.519 --> 00:30:31.237
The disputed letters--that is
the letters that scholars

00:30:31.237 --> 00:30:34.270
disagree about,
and then there are three

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.618
letters that most scholars are
agreed are not by Paul.

00:30:37.618 --> 00:30:41.172
The undisputed letters are
Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians,

00:30:41.172 --> 00:30:44.788
Galatians, Philippians,
1 Thessalonians and Philemon.

00:30:44.788 --> 00:30:50.298
Most of us reject as being by a
later disciple of Paul,

00:30:50.298 --> 00:30:52.588
maybe even written in the
second century,

00:30:52.588 --> 00:30:55.421
some people believe these are
decades after Paul's death that

00:30:55.421 --> 00:30:59.960
these letters are written,
1 and 2 Timothy and Titus.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.563
We also call these the Pastoral
Epistles because they show Paul

00:31:03.563 --> 00:31:06.933
trying to teach Timothy and
Titus how to be good pastors of

00:31:06.933 --> 00:31:07.690
a church.
 

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.865
It's Paul giving instruction,
so-called Paul,

00:31:09.865 --> 00:31:12.140
giving instruction to pastors
of the church.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.608
Now for these letters there's a
lot more debate about.

00:31:14.608 --> 00:31:17.577
I would say that--I've ranked
them here according to how

00:31:17.577 --> 00:31:20.653
likely some scholars believe
they may have been written by

00:31:20.653 --> 00:31:21.140
Paul.
 

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.589
More scholars will take 2
Thessalonians as being by Paul;

00:31:24.589 --> 00:31:26.368
a lot of us doubt it.
 

00:31:26.368 --> 00:31:31.624
A few--fewer scholars will take
Colossians as being by Paul with

00:31:31.624 --> 00:31:35.224
more doubt on that,
and then Ephesians is a letter,

00:31:35.224 --> 00:31:38.699
is a different letter written
by a different person which used

00:31:38.699 --> 00:31:42.082
Colossians as a model,
and more people believe that

00:31:42.082 --> 00:31:43.848
Ephesians is not by Paul.
 

00:31:43.848 --> 00:31:47.891
In a rank of descending
probability, 2 Thessalonians,

00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:52.397
Colossians, and Ephesians are
doubted as being truly by the

00:31:52.397 --> 00:31:53.720
Apostle Paul.
 

00:32:00.278 --> 00:32:03.680
That's just to give you what's
going on here.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.701
Just for a moment,
let me back up also and tell

00:32:05.701 --> 00:32:07.768
you before we turn to some
particular texts in 1

00:32:07.768 --> 00:32:08.558
Thessalonians.
 

00:32:08.558 --> 00:32:12.336
Remember the lecture about the
house church and remember I

00:32:12.336 --> 00:32:16.511
talked about the Roman household
structure and the patron client

00:32:16.511 --> 00:32:17.440
structure?
 

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.294
Now this will be very
important, especially for your

00:32:20.294 --> 00:32:22.308
discussions this week on
Philemon.

00:32:22.308 --> 00:32:25.441
Remember that the Roman
household is a pyramid kind of

00:32:25.441 --> 00:32:27.653
structure,
with the paterfamilias,

00:32:27.653 --> 00:32:29.818
the Roman head of the household
at the top,

00:32:29.818 --> 00:32:34.085
and that person's sons and
daughters being next in the

00:32:34.085 --> 00:32:36.217
level,
the person's slaves in the

00:32:36.217 --> 00:32:38.490
household being at the very
bottom level.

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:41.502
Then above the slaves,
and below the sons and the

00:32:41.502 --> 00:32:44.221
daughters,
you've got people like freed

00:32:44.221 --> 00:32:48.231
persons of the householder who
become then the householder's

00:32:48.231 --> 00:32:48.980
clients.
 

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.682
The clients give honor to their
patron and the patron gives

00:32:52.682 --> 00:32:56.510
financial security and sometimes
legal help or other kinds of

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:57.895
help,
social help,

00:32:57.895 --> 00:33:00.009
social connections to the
client.

00:33:00.009 --> 00:33:03.413
You might even have free
people, free men and women who

00:33:03.413 --> 00:33:06.944
are connected to different
households even if they're not

00:33:06.944 --> 00:33:09.720
connected legally because in
Roman law,

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.855
a freed slave,
the freed man was even legally

00:33:12.855 --> 00:33:16.431
a client of the patron,
still owed legal duties to the

00:33:16.431 --> 00:33:16.890
patron.
 

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:20.749
It wasn't like the person who
was freed became entirely free

00:33:20.749 --> 00:33:24.019
and footloose and happy away
from the household.

00:33:24.019 --> 00:33:26.240
They still had connections,
both legal connections,

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.503
but apart from the legal
requirements you would have even

00:33:29.503 --> 00:33:33.058
other non-legal clients become
like clients of a household.

00:33:33.058 --> 00:33:36.373
That's--we're going to see how
different house churches start

00:33:36.373 --> 00:33:37.808
constructing themselves.
 

00:33:37.808 --> 00:33:41.375
Paul, in his letters,
will repeatedly then address

00:33:41.375 --> 00:33:44.358
certain people by name and greet
them,

00:33:44.358 --> 00:33:46.632
and he'll say,
and the church that meets in

00:33:46.632 --> 00:33:48.308
your house or in their house.
 

00:33:48.308 --> 00:33:51.420
That's setting up that "I
did it."

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.519
The people he's named are kind
of considered the patrons,

00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:57.964
the paterfamilias of the
house church and then the house

00:33:57.964 --> 00:34:00.298
church has this patron client
structure.

00:34:00.298 --> 00:34:04.140
Keep that in mind when we talk
about this.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.692
Let's back up again and say
now, so what did Paul teach to

00:34:07.692 --> 00:34:08.940
the Thessalonians?
 

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.295
First, he taught them mainly to
turn from idol worship and

00:34:13.295 --> 00:34:14.289
polytheism.
 

00:34:14.289 --> 00:34:17.451
Now this is hard for us to
think about today because you

00:34:17.451 --> 00:34:20.784
don't go around to almost any
church and they have an altar

00:34:20.784 --> 00:34:23.063
call,
we had lots of altar calls in

00:34:23.063 --> 00:34:23.710
my church.
 

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:25.864
They had songs at the end,
"Just As I Am"

00:34:25.864 --> 00:34:28.409
sung with like 75 different
verses and they're trying to get

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.909
you to come down to confess
Jesus as your Lord and personal

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:33.375
Savior and be prayed for,
and maybe be baptized,

00:34:33.375 --> 00:34:35.842
and they keep singing the
invitation song until you

00:34:35.842 --> 00:34:38.704
finally feel guilty enough that
you come down front for the

00:34:38.704 --> 00:34:41.268
altar call and "yes the
busses will wait,

00:34:41.268 --> 00:34:43.340
the busses will wait,
come on down."

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:47.101
In almost no situation like
that are they saying you need to

00:34:47.101 --> 00:34:49.775
turn from--
stop worshipping Zeus and

00:34:49.775 --> 00:34:53.909
Apollo and Artemis and turn to
the living and true God.

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:57.719
Our Gospels today have other
kinds of messages,

00:34:57.719 --> 00:35:00.106
but apparently,
the most fundamental message

00:35:00.106 --> 00:35:03.213
that Paul was telling people
when he went around to these

00:35:03.213 --> 00:35:05.489
Greek cities was idols are not
gods,

00:35:05.489 --> 00:35:08.038
you need to stop worshipping
these stones and rocks and

00:35:08.038 --> 00:35:09.887
things,
and start worshipping the God

00:35:09.887 --> 00:35:10.409
of Israel.
 

00:35:10.409 --> 00:35:12.599
The God of Israel is the only
true God;

00:35:12.599 --> 00:35:15.137
he's the only living God,
all the rest of these are dead

00:35:15.137 --> 00:35:15.460
gods.
 

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.708
That's the main thing that Paul
seems to have been teaching as

00:35:18.708 --> 00:35:20.679
he quotes there in 1
Thessalonians.

00:35:20.679 --> 00:35:24.101
Like I said,
he's teaching them to accept

00:35:24.101 --> 00:35:28.981
the God of Israel as their God,
he's teaching them to accept

00:35:28.981 --> 00:35:32.853
the kingship of Jesus Christ as
God's Son and the Jewish

00:35:32.853 --> 00:35:36.317
Messiah,
to await the salvation of Jesus

00:35:36.317 --> 00:35:39.780
to come from heaven in the near
future,

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.409
so, yes, Jesus is going to
swoop down from heaven,

00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:44.289
and Paul is expecting this very
soon,

00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:47.429
and then to avoid certain
Gentile behaviors,

00:35:47.429 --> 00:35:49.836
and he kind of will list
sometimes things he calls

00:35:49.836 --> 00:35:50.820
Gentile behaviors.
 

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.923
One of the most important of
those Gentile behaviors was

00:35:53.923 --> 00:35:56.512
sexual immorality,
or in the Greek simply the word

00:35:56.512 --> 00:35:59.320
porneia where we get the
word "pornography."

00:36:02.699 --> 00:36:05.846
This is very difficult to
translate into English because

00:36:05.846 --> 00:36:08.590
it could be used in Greek simply
for "sexual

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.849
intercourse."
 

00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:13.550
A porne also was used
for "a prostitute"

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.920
but it didn't mean necessarily
someone who sold--

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.286
a porne just was "a
sex person,"

00:36:19.286 --> 00:36:21.653
"a sex woman"
or "a sex man,"

00:36:21.653 --> 00:36:24.909
so porneia meant really
basically just "sex."

00:36:24.909 --> 00:36:28.487
To Jews at the time it came to
represent every aspect of

00:36:28.487 --> 00:36:31.869
sexuality that they believed
were wrong and that only

00:36:31.869 --> 00:36:34.166
Gentiles did,
but they included a lot of

00:36:34.166 --> 00:36:34.860
things in this.
 

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.260
Adultery would be included in
porneia,

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.154
all kinds of having sex with
anybody else but your married

00:36:40.154 --> 00:36:42.489
partner would be considered
porneia,

00:36:42.489 --> 00:36:45.030
masturbation could be
considered porneia,

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.900
homosexuality could be
considered porneia,

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.146
having the woman on top with a
man could be considered

00:36:51.146 --> 00:36:53.596
porneia,
if the woman uses a dildo or

00:36:53.596 --> 00:36:55.905
something to penetrate the man
that could also be

00:36:55.905 --> 00:36:58.717
porneia,
any kind of oral sex whether it

00:36:58.717 --> 00:37:01.786
was homosexual or heterosexual,
any oral sex was considered

00:37:01.786 --> 00:37:04.958
porneia by the Jews,
so porneia was just any

00:37:04.958 --> 00:37:08.644
list of things that Jews
believed shouldn't be done and

00:37:08.644 --> 00:37:12.998
that Gentiles typically did,
and that's one thing Paul is

00:37:12.998 --> 00:37:14.469
very much against.
 

00:37:14.469 --> 00:37:17.498
He talks about that in one
place, look in 1 Thessalonians

00:37:17.498 --> 00:37:19.929
4,
now remember he's addressing

00:37:19.929 --> 00:37:23.710
here men who used to be Greeks
and who thought--

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.193
who probably thought nothing at
all about having sex with lots

00:37:26.193 --> 00:37:27.090
of different people.
 

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.650
The Greeks didn't seem to have
many--

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.101
of course women weren't
supposed to have sex because the

00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:33.840
woman was the possession of the
man,

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.018
but they didn't care about men
having sex with prostitutes,

00:37:37.018 --> 00:37:39.054
or other men,
or other women,

00:37:39.054 --> 00:37:41.090
there's no danger in that.
 

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:45.550
He's talking to people whose
idea of sex was that it's not

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.429
that big a deal,
4:1:

00:37:47.429 --> 00:37:50.271
Finally brothers [he's not
saying sisters here the word is

00:37:50.271 --> 00:37:52.766
"brothers,"
and you'll see why as he goes

00:37:52.766 --> 00:37:54.510
on.]
We ask and urge you in the Lord

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:57.603
Jesus that as you learn from us
how ought to live and to please

00:37:57.603 --> 00:38:00.335
God as you are doing,
you do so more and more for you

00:38:00.335 --> 00:38:02.690
know what instructions we gave
you through the Lord Jesus.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.030
For this is the will of God,
your sanctification,

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:07.699
that you abstain from
porneia,

00:38:07.699 --> 00:38:09.132
[It's translated in your text
maybe as

00:38:09.132 --> 00:38:11.382
"fornication";
it just means any kind of

00:38:11.382 --> 00:38:13.420
immoral sex.]
that each of you know how to

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.507
control your own vessel
["vessel"

00:38:15.507 --> 00:38:17.588
is the actual Greek,
it may be translated as

00:38:17.588 --> 00:38:19.201
"body"
but it means "vessel"

00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:20.539
so there's a debate among
scholars,

00:38:20.539 --> 00:38:24.217
is this talking about control
your own body as a man or to

00:38:24.217 --> 00:38:28.088
control your woman whose the
vessel for your sexual overflow]

00:38:28.088 --> 00:38:32.409
in holiness and honor,
not with lustful passion not

00:38:32.409 --> 00:38:37.110
with desire like the Gentiles
who do not know God.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:41.590
Sexual desire and passion are
linked in Paul's mind only to

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.989
the Gentile world,
not the body of Christ.

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:48.525
"That no one wrong or
exploit a brother in this

00:38:48.525 --> 00:38:50.884
matter,"
"or sister"

00:38:50.884 --> 00:38:52.480
is not in the text.
 

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:56.030
You don't exploit your brother
and the reason that makes a big

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:59.057
difference is that ancient
people never thought about

00:38:59.057 --> 00:39:02.260
defrauding a woman by having sex
with her husband,

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.882
they just didn't think that
way, but because the woman was

00:39:05.882 --> 00:39:08.869
the receptacle for the sexuality
of the man,

00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:12.054
and she was polluted by having
sex with any man except her

00:39:12.054 --> 00:39:14.605
husband,
to have sex with another man's

00:39:14.605 --> 00:39:18.090
woman was depriving that man of
his property rights,

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:21.556
so it made no sense to talk
about defrauding the woman here,

00:39:21.556 --> 00:39:22.320
the sister.
 

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.898
It made perfect sense in Paul's
mind to talk about defrauding

00:39:24.898 --> 00:39:25.500
the brother.
 

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.969
"Because the Lord is
avenged in all these things.

00:39:27.969 --> 00:39:30.768
For God did not call you to
impurity but holiness,

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:32.731
therefore whoever rejects this
rejects not human authority but

00:39:32.731 --> 00:39:34.050
God who gives us the Holy
Spirit."

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.237
Notice what Paul's doing,
Paul just like almost anybody

00:39:36.237 --> 00:39:39.181
else of his society,
he's talking to men here,

00:39:39.181 --> 00:39:41.559
and he says,
you guys, now you're in this

00:39:41.559 --> 00:39:42.967
new church,
this new community,

00:39:42.967 --> 00:39:45.150
this is different from the way
you used to live,

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:48.380
so you guys,
have your own mate and do what

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.380
you need to do with her.
 

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.996
Just control yourself and do
what you need to do with her,

00:39:53.996 --> 00:39:57.360
don't go after the woman of
your Christian brother.

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.650
Why?
 

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.119
Notice he says nothing about
any concern for the woman.

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:05.025
At least in this text he shows
no concerns for the woman's

00:40:05.025 --> 00:40:05.780
interest.
 

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.396
What he says is,
if you have sex with another

00:40:08.396 --> 00:40:11.193
man's woman you will be
defrauding your brother,

00:40:11.193 --> 00:40:13.869
you're robbing your brother of
his right.

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:17.418
That shows this very
traditional Jewish sense about

00:40:17.418 --> 00:40:21.039
porneia sexuality that
Paul is expressing.

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:24.398
You can see why he needs to say
this because he's addressing

00:40:24.398 --> 00:40:26.960
this group of guys who had all
been Greeks.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.730
Now what is he also saying?
 

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:32.967
Look at 5:1-11,
this is something else he seems

00:40:32.967 --> 00:40:37.248
to need to clear up with them:
Concerning the times and

00:40:37.248 --> 00:40:39.711
seasons, brothers and sisters,
you do not need to have

00:40:39.711 --> 00:40:41.791
anything written to you,
for you yourselves know very

00:40:41.791 --> 00:40:44.195
well that the day of the Lord
will come like a thief in the

00:40:44.195 --> 00:40:44.570
night.
 

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.659
When they say there is peace
and security,

00:40:46.659 --> 00:40:50.275
then sudden destruction will
come upon them as labor pains

00:40:50.275 --> 00:40:53.239
come upon a pregnant woman,
there will be no escape.

00:40:53.239 --> 00:40:55.981
He's talking about that Jesus
coming on the clouds of heaven

00:40:55.981 --> 00:40:56.260
now.
 

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.657
He's getting to what he's--he
eluded to it the first,

00:40:58.657 --> 00:41:00.869
now he's telling you how it's
going to happen.

00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:03.699
This is how it's going to
happen and he's telling them you

00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:06.329
don't need to be--he's reminding
us of this, right?

00:41:06.329 --> 00:41:08.489
He's always said,
you don't need to be told this,

00:41:08.489 --> 00:41:10.559
I'm reminding you of stuff you
already know.

00:41:10.559 --> 00:41:12.260
This is stuff he's told them.
 

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:15.329
But you beloved are not in
darkness for that day to

00:41:15.329 --> 00:41:17.050
surprise you like a thief.
 

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.949
You are all children of light
and children of the day,

00:41:18.949 --> 00:41:20.860
we are not of the night as of
darkness,

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.641
so let us not fall asleep as
others do but let us keep awake

00:41:23.641 --> 00:41:24.349
and be sober.
 

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:26.110
For those who sleep,
sleep at night,

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:29.077
those who are drunk get drunk
at night, but we belong to the

00:41:29.077 --> 00:41:29.480
day.
 

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.347
In other words,
he says, basically,

00:41:31.347 --> 00:41:33.766
stay awake, stay aware,
it's going to happen,

00:41:33.766 --> 00:41:35.909
you don't know when,
just be ready.

00:41:35.909 --> 00:41:37.690
Why does he remind them of that?
 

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.264
Let's look back,
4:13, now this is after he's

00:41:41.264 --> 00:41:44.268
talked about porneia,
4:13,

00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:48.454
"But we do not want you to
be uninformed brothers,"

00:41:48.454 --> 00:41:50.994
I grew up in that--
the King James Version says,

00:41:50.994 --> 00:41:52.489
"We would not have you
ignorant,

00:41:52.489 --> 00:41:54.264
brothers,"
which the men in my church like

00:41:54.264 --> 00:41:56.179
to say,
"We wouldn't have you,

00:41:56.179 --> 00:41:58.824
ignorant brothers,
about those who have

00:41:58.824 --> 00:41:59.730
died."
 

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:01.592
Now notice, now he's telling
them something new,

00:42:01.592 --> 00:42:03.099
this is not stuff they already
know.

00:42:03.099 --> 00:42:05.795
This is new material,
so this is not stuff he's

00:42:05.795 --> 00:42:07.320
preached to them before.
 

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:10.960
So that you may not grieve as
others who do not have hope

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:13.170
[He's telling them don't grieve.
 

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.880
People in the church seem to
have died,

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.929
he says, don't grieve,
don't grieve.]

00:42:16.929 --> 00:42:20.059
For since we believe that Jesus
died and rose again,

00:42:20.059 --> 00:42:24.117
even so through Jesus God will
bring with him those who have

00:42:24.117 --> 00:42:24.599
died.
 

00:42:24.599 --> 00:42:27.963
For this we declare to you by
the word of the Lord that we who

00:42:27.963 --> 00:42:30.244
are alive,
who are left until the coming

00:42:30.244 --> 00:42:32.929
of the Lord,
[Paul believes that he probably

00:42:32.929 --> 00:42:35.481
will still be alive when Jesus
comes back]

00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:38.469
will by no means precede those
who have died.

00:42:38.469 --> 00:42:41.300
For the Lord himself,
with the cry of command,

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:43.626
with the archangels' call,
with the sound of God's

00:42:43.626 --> 00:42:45.661
trumpet,
will descend from heaven,

00:42:45.661 --> 00:42:47.840
the dead in Christ will rise
first.

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.351
[This is not something he's
told them before,

00:42:50.351 --> 00:42:51.891
see.]
Then we who are alive,

00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:54.119
who are left,
will be caught up in the clouds

00:42:54.119 --> 00:42:55.980
together with them to meet the
Lord in the air.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.349
And so we will be with the Lord
forever.

00:42:58.349 --> 00:43:00.900
Therefore encourage one another
with these words.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.768
This is pretty astounding to me.
 

00:43:03.768 --> 00:43:08.800
These people did not know what
happened to dead people in

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:09.610
Christ.
 

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:13.340
Paul hadn't told them that when
he preached to them.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.054
In modern Christianity,
in fact a lot of modern

00:43:16.054 --> 00:43:19.335
religion in the west,
we tend to think one of the

00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:22.719
main things people become
religious for is to live

00:43:22.719 --> 00:43:25.260
forever,
life after death,

00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.969
to go to heaven.
 

00:43:26.969 --> 00:43:31.068
What modern Christians think
salvation is is salvation from

00:43:31.068 --> 00:43:33.260
death or salvation from hell.
 

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:37.842
These people converted to this
new group without having been

00:43:37.842 --> 00:43:39.320
told any of that.
 

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.963
What seems to have happened is
that Paul converted them because

00:43:42.963 --> 00:43:45.077
he said,
Jesus will save you from this

00:43:45.077 --> 00:43:48.264
big apocalyptic coming wrath of
God that's coming upon the whole

00:43:48.264 --> 00:43:48.719
world.
 

00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:51.273
So convert, come to Jesus,
and he'll save you from that,

00:43:51.273 --> 00:43:52.900
he'll rescue you from that
wrath.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:55.835
What they seemed to have was
that, while they were still

00:43:55.835 --> 00:43:57.699
living,
any week now Jesus would come

00:43:57.699 --> 00:43:59.498
down,
he would destroy the evil

00:43:59.498 --> 00:44:02.929
people, and he would set up the
kingdom of God on earth,

00:44:02.929 --> 00:44:05.748
and we'd have a new kingdom,
a new eon that would last

00:44:05.748 --> 00:44:06.280
forever.
 

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.521
God would be over everything,
Jesus would be the king of

00:44:08.521 --> 00:44:09.900
earth,
but it's not like it's going to

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:11.139
happen in a thousand years from
now,

00:44:11.139 --> 00:44:13.050
they were all expecting it to
happen right now.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.806
What they converted to was to
escape the wrath and to live on

00:44:16.806 --> 00:44:18.059
into that kingdom.
 

00:44:18.059 --> 00:44:22.411
They weren't expecting anybody
to die, and somebody in their

00:44:22.411 --> 00:44:24.402
community dies,
and they go,

00:44:24.402 --> 00:44:25.139
what?!
 

00:44:25.139 --> 00:44:29.001
Mary just died,
she's going to miss out on a

00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:31.692
party,
she's not going to get--partake

00:44:31.692 --> 00:44:34.148
in the parousia,
which is this Greek word that

00:44:34.148 --> 00:44:35.568
means "the coming,
the appearing,

00:44:35.568 --> 00:44:36.829
the presence"
of Jesus.

00:44:36.829 --> 00:44:38.630
It's the word here for
"the coming of Jesus."

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:40.786
The parousia of Jesus,
she's not going to be able to

00:44:40.786 --> 00:44:41.940
participate because she died.
 

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:45.684
Paul says, wait,
I forgot to tell you something,

00:44:45.684 --> 00:44:48.074
there will be people that die.
 

00:44:48.074 --> 00:44:49.349
Don't grieve.
 

00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:51.585
Now that's a pretty radical
thing, in the ancient world you

00:44:51.585 --> 00:44:53.822
just don't go around telling
people, don't grieve over your

00:44:53.822 --> 00:44:54.170
dead.
 

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:56.530
Grieving is a big deal for
everybody.

00:44:56.530 --> 00:44:57.989
You're supposed to grieve,
right?

00:44:57.989 --> 00:45:01.130
Paul is so radical he tells
them not to grieve.

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:06.360
He says, don't grieve because,
Mary's died,

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.119
but when Jesus comes back
before we all get swooped up

00:45:10.119 --> 00:45:13.786
into the air to be with him,
the graves will all open,

00:45:13.786 --> 00:45:15.780
the dead in Christ will rise
up,

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:19.559
they'll all fly up in the air,
they'll meet Jesus in the air,

00:45:19.559 --> 00:45:22.474
and then we'll fly up in the
air, we'll meet Jesus in the

00:45:22.474 --> 00:45:23.804
air,
and then we'll all come back

00:45:23.804 --> 00:45:25.150
down here and have the Kingdom
of God.

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:29.730
Don't worry the dead people
won't miss out on anything.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:37.148
Now isn't that curious that
Paul has to fill in this big gap

00:45:37.148 --> 00:45:39.789
in their knowledge.
 

00:45:39.789 --> 00:45:43.257
The very thing that most of us
modern people think you become a

00:45:43.257 --> 00:45:47.507
Christian for--
which is immortal life or the

00:45:47.507 --> 00:45:52.021
immorality of the soul,
or life after death--the

00:45:52.021 --> 00:45:54.949
Thessalonians didn't know
anything about.

00:45:54.949 --> 00:45:57.429
They did sort of know this
thing about eternal life I

00:45:57.429 --> 00:45:59.150
think,
but I think what they thought

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.777
was, that if you were still
living when Jesus came back then

00:46:01.777 --> 00:46:03.070
you'd get to live forever.
 

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.384
They were upset because people
in their community had died and

00:46:06.384 --> 00:46:09.210
they didn't know what was going
to happen to them.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:11.690
So Paul tells them this bit of
information.

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.630
In other words,
what Paul had first told them

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:17.972
was what would happen to them
when Jesus came back,

00:46:17.972 --> 00:46:20.980
they would be safe from the
wrath of God.

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.010
Now Paul has to write to them
to say,

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.275
now don't worry,
if people in your community die

00:46:26.275 --> 00:46:28.300
because it's all still going to
happen,

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.860
but they won't get left out
either.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:37.068
It gives us a very interesting
sense of what kind of group this

00:46:37.068 --> 00:46:40.369
was,
that they didn't know something

00:46:40.369 --> 00:46:43.835
about Christianity,
the resurrection of Christians

00:46:43.835 --> 00:46:47.018
at the end of time,
that's so much part of the

00:46:47.018 --> 00:46:50.717
Creeds, part of modern faith,
part of faith of the last 2,000

00:46:50.717 --> 00:46:52.469
years,
and these early converts to

00:46:52.469 --> 00:46:54.300
this group didn't seem to know
it.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.579
So what kind of group is this?
 

00:46:56.579 --> 00:47:00.427
Now I want to go back to the
fact that I said over and over

00:47:00.427 --> 00:47:04.010
again Paul never addresses any
women in this letter.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:07.568
Now it's not because he doesn't
address women in other letters,

00:47:07.568 --> 00:47:10.840
and other letters Paul does
talk to women even by name.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:12.340
He talks about women's problems.
 

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.619
If you look in 1 Corinthians,
and we will when we get there,

00:47:15.619 --> 00:47:19.420
Paul brings up this issue of
sexual immorality again,

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.559
and there he talks to the
husbands and says,

00:47:22.559 --> 00:47:25.936
you husbands don't go fooling
around with somebody else's

00:47:25.936 --> 00:47:29.409
wife,
but he also talks to the wives.

00:47:29.409 --> 00:47:31.164
In other words,
Paul, in other places when he

00:47:31.164 --> 00:47:32.920
talks to husbands,
he talks to wives also.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.289
When he talks to men he talks
to women,

00:47:36.289 --> 00:47:40.150
he addresses women's problems
in different letters,

00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:44.829
but in 1 Thessalonians he never
talks to a woman at all,

00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:48.454
and he only talks about women
when he's talking about men

00:47:48.454 --> 00:47:51.820
trying to get them to control
themselves sexually.

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.820
What he says to them is,
control your own thing guys,

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.166
the Greek word translated
"body"

00:47:59.166 --> 00:48:02.028
or "vessel"
also means "thing,"

00:48:02.028 --> 00:48:04.757
skuos,
that's what Paul uses there,

00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:05.969
control your thing.
 

00:48:05.969 --> 00:48:09.226
Now does "thing"
refer to his body,

00:48:09.226 --> 00:48:11.889
his wife's body,
or his genitalia?

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:14.737
It's anybody's guess,
and different interpreters

00:48:14.737 --> 00:48:17.949
disagree about how they would
want to translate it.

00:48:17.949 --> 00:48:21.793
What it certainly shows is that
Paul's addressing a group of

00:48:21.793 --> 00:48:24.327
men,
and one scholar from Copenhagen

00:48:24.327 --> 00:48:27.010
has written an article where she
says,

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:28.460
we ought to take this seriously.
 

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.976
At least at this stage in
Paul's career,

00:48:30.976 --> 00:48:34.784
maybe he really did see these
groups as being primarily male

00:48:34.784 --> 00:48:35.429
clubs.
 

00:48:35.429 --> 00:48:39.224
Sure, they may have had women
and daughters and wives as part

00:48:39.224 --> 00:48:42.326
of them in a way,
but maybe in Paul's conception

00:48:42.326 --> 00:48:45.079
these things were sort of like
fraternities.

00:48:45.079 --> 00:48:49.121
The fraternity of Jesus,
and that's why he addresses

00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:52.530
only men and he doesn't talk
about women.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:55.280
And that's why when he's
talking about--

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.034
and these are a fraternity that
seem not to have expected the

00:48:59.034 --> 00:49:02.099
resurrection and all this other
kind of stuff,

00:49:02.099 --> 00:49:05.739
so Paul writes 1 Thessalonians
to clue them in on it.

00:49:05.739 --> 00:49:11.351
What this would be would be a
male club of Greek speaking,

00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:14.010
Gentile, manual laborers.
 

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:19.878
They've now been initiated into
a new group that demands

00:49:19.878 --> 00:49:26.172
adherence and loyalty to the God
of the Jews and an expected

00:49:26.172 --> 00:49:28.199
Jewish Messiah.
 

00:49:28.199 --> 00:49:34.945
In other words,
this is an apocalyptic Jewish

00:49:34.945 --> 00:49:37.860
sect of Gentiles.
 

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:42.775
Now we'll see after spring
break how some of Paul's other

00:49:42.775 --> 00:49:47.846
letters show that his churches,
if they started off like that,

00:49:47.846 --> 00:49:50.489
they became a lot more complex
later.

00:49:50.489 --> 00:49:53.449
See you after spring break.
 

00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:55.320
Have--you'll be talking about
Philemon,

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.409
a lot of the stuff we talked
about today,

00:49:57.409 --> 00:50:00.557
house churches,
that sort of stuff may be

00:50:00.557 --> 00:50:04.099
important for your discussion
groups this--

00:50:04.099 --> 00:50:06.018
not this week right you're
doing that next time.

00:50:06.018 --> 00:50:07.739
Student:  We have class
next week.

00:50:07.739 --> 00:50:09.601
Prof: Oh we have
class--that's right,

00:50:09.601 --> 00:50:10.768
this is not spring break.
 

00:50:10.768 --> 00:50:12.869
Good, we can cover all this
next time.

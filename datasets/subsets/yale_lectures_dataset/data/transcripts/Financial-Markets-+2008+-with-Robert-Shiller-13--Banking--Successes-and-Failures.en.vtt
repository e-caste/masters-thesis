00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:05.047
Professor Robert
Shiller: Before I begin,

00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:08.962
I want to say something about
our speaker on Wednesday,

00:00:08.962 --> 00:00:11.347
Andrew Redleaf.
First of all,

00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:16.000
he accepted our invitation to
go to lunch with some of you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.904
So, I want to arrange an event,
actually at one of the

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:27.702
college's cafeteria.
I haven't figured out--maybe

00:00:27.702 --> 00:00:31.774
one of you has a suggestion,
especially if we can get a--see

00:00:31.774 --> 00:00:35.914
what college he was here--we did
it in his college because he

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:39.618
graduated from Yale.
I've forgotten which one that

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:42.524
was.
It had a nice room upstairs,

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:46.280
so maybe I'll try to get that
one again.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.992
Of course, he said he doesn't
particularly care--maybe I

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:52.957
should take him to another one.
Yeah, if you can suggest a

00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:58.532
college, which has a nice room
and that will be both--I'll come

00:00:58.532 --> 00:01:06.090
and Redleaf will come;
so, that's this Wednesday.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.110
What I'm going to do is email
you the details.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.405
If you could email me if you're
interested in coming,

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:21.700
so we can have a good size
group and a discussion.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.129
I just want to say a little bit
about Redleaf.

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:36.475
He founded Whitebox Advisors in
2000--so that's eight years

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:44.580
ago--and it is now up to $1.8
billion assets under management.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.701
"Assets under management" is
how much money he has drawn in

00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:53.372
from investors.
So, he's doing quite well and

00:01:53.372 --> 00:02:00.060
he has some celebrity status
among hedge fund managers.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.233
Notably, I put on the website
for March 5^(th),

00:02:05.233 --> 00:02:10.243
under our class syllabus,
a New York Times article

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:13.300
about him entitled,
"Curiosity Has Its Merits."

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.594
I guess it struck the author of
that article that Redleaf is

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:23.620
just a guy who was very curious
about a lot of things.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.216
He wants to know how things
work and why things are

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:31.233
happening.
That might be a natural impulse

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:33.949
and some people have that more
than others.

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.449
It's probably a good impulse to
have if you're going into

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.281
investment.
Of course, he turns it into

00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:43.368
productive purpose,
so there are a couple examples

00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:47.051
from that article.
One is that--there's a

00:02:47.051 --> 00:02:51.442
literature in finance about
options and stock price

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:55.185
performance,
which goes back ten years,

00:02:55.185 --> 00:03:00.410
that shows that something is
not quite right with the way

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.310
companies issue options.
Let me remind you what happens.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.530
What's happening,
increasingly,

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.009
is that employees or top
executive employees,

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:15.968
at least, in companies are
rewarded as part of their

00:03:15.968 --> 00:03:20.392
compensation with options on the
value of the stock of the

00:03:20.392 --> 00:03:24.759
company they work for.
You work for XYZ Corporation;

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:28.629
the share is trading at $10 a
share;

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.875
they would give you "at the
money" or "out of the money"

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:37.120
options--say options to buy the
stock at $11 a share.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.228
That's $1 more than it costs
now in the market,

00:03:40.228 --> 00:03:44.079
so the options are worthless
unless the price of the stock

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.150
goes up.
So, that's supposed to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.360
incentivize you as a manager to
get the stock price up.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.470
Then you make money if the
price of the stock rises above,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.490
in that case,
$11 a share.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.275
All that is fine,
it sounds good that managers

00:03:58.275 --> 00:04:02.175
should be given options because
it will incentivize them to work

00:04:02.175 --> 00:04:04.590
for the benefit of the
corporation.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.593
The problem that's been
revealed in finance literature

00:04:09.593 --> 00:04:14.973
is that there's an uncanny
tendency for the stock price to

00:04:14.973 --> 00:04:20.637
go up after the company awards
large quantities of options to

00:04:20.637 --> 00:04:24.009
its executives.
Does that sound suspicious?

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.718
I mean, you could say,
well that means the options are

00:04:26.718 --> 00:04:29.734
really working well because it
really motivated the managers

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:32.750
and they did something and made
the company worth more.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.531
If it suddenly goes up right
after they're issued you kind of

00:04:37.531 --> 00:04:40.720
suspect that something is screwy
here.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.968
So, there's been a number of
articles that documented that

00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:49.217
stock prices tend to jump
shortly after options are issued

00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:52.618
to managers.
The immediate suspicion that

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:56.800
this raised, and I think it's
more than a suspicion,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.371
is that companies will time
announcement of good news until

00:05:00.371 --> 00:05:04.350
after they issue the options.
The managers of the companies

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.706
are kind of a group helping each
other--let's award options to

00:05:08.706 --> 00:05:12.776
each other and then after we
award them we'll announce the

00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:17.131
good news and the stock price
will go up and you guys will get

00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:19.617
money.
There's a tax incentive to do

00:05:19.617 --> 00:05:22.038
that.
If they awarded options that

00:05:22.038 --> 00:05:26.009
were "in the money"--that means
already exercisable at

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.906
profit--then they would be
subject to a tax liability

00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:33.149
immediately,
so they don't want to do that.

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:36.503
They want to issue them "out of
the money" and then announce the

00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:38.579
news that brings them "in the
money."

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:41.829
It's been proven that companies
do that.

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:45.614
More recently--I was just
reading about this in the

00:05:45.614 --> 00:05:49.824
Times.
There was an article by Eric

00:05:49.824 --> 00:05:56.302
Lee that showed that it's not
just announcement of news that

00:05:56.302 --> 00:05:59.614
does it;
it's also that companies must

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:03.679
be backdating options because
Lee showed that some of the

00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:07.961
price jumps that occur after the
options are issued couldn't

00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:11.735
possibly have been manipulated
by the companies' news

00:06:11.735 --> 00:06:14.948
announcements.
It must have been that they

00:06:14.948 --> 00:06:18.514
somehow knew on the issuance
date that the stock price was

00:06:18.514 --> 00:06:21.087
going to go up,
but he said they couldn't

00:06:21.087 --> 00:06:24.040
possibly know that in these
general circumstances.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.800
Lee concluded that companies
were fraudulently backdating

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.857
options.
He concluded this on the basis

00:06:31.857 --> 00:06:34.649
of a statistical test.
You see what I'm saying?

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:38.555
If stock price option--if stock
options tend to be issued as

00:06:38.555 --> 00:06:42.971
announced by the company later,
just before stock prices go up,

00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:47.290
there's no way that that can be
right because nobody can know

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.889
exactly when the stock price is
going to go up.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.068
So, they must have been lying
about the date that they issued

00:06:54.068 --> 00:06:57.549
the options.
You understand that issue about

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:01.543
backdating?
It was--this article by Eric

00:07:01.543 --> 00:07:07.725
Lee was something of a scandal
and it led then to regulatory

00:07:07.725 --> 00:07:13.592
authorities to--regulatory
authorities then realized that

00:07:13.592 --> 00:07:19.459
there's some fraud going on--not
most corporations.

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:23.532
I think Lee identified a small,
but definitely some of them,

00:07:23.532 --> 00:07:27.000
that were lying about the date.
You know what I'm saying?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.759
They would announce in December
that we issued back in August

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:35.045
these options to our executives.
Funny thing--the stock price

00:07:35.045 --> 00:07:40.050
soared right between August and
December when they announced it.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.818
The regulatory authorities were
starting to look into

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:46.790
this--that's fraud to backdate
options.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.491
What does Andrew Redleaf do?
He decided to do his own study

00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:55.829
parallel to Eric Lee's and much
more pervasive.

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:59.588
So, he was going after himself,
finding out all the companies

00:07:59.588 --> 00:08:03.529
that were backdating options,
trying to beat the SEC and the

00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:06.330
regulatory authorities to the
conclusion.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.603
What did he do?
He shorted the stocks or

00:08:08.603 --> 00:08:11.043
whatever to benefit.
Once they're investigated,

00:08:11.043 --> 00:08:14.120
their stock prices and their
bond prices are going to fall.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.363
He did the--he found out who
they were, using similar methods

00:08:19.363 --> 00:08:23.220
to Lee's and profited from it.
Is that a good thing?

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.031
Well, that's the way Wall
Street works or at least a--some

00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:31.310
people say markets are efficient
and stock prices incorporate all

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.799
information.
I don't think they are

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:37.220
efficient and this is an
example--a Redleaf example.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.894
In a sense, efficient markets
would require that

00:08:40.894 --> 00:08:45.508
everybody--every analyst rushes
out and completes Eric Lee's

00:08:45.508 --> 00:08:48.322
study.
But they don't--I don't know,

00:08:48.322 --> 00:08:52.037
it's just--there isn't enough
initiative in the world,

00:08:52.037 --> 00:08:56.424
not many people do it.
Redleaf was able to figure out

00:08:56.424 --> 00:09:01.957
who was going to get hit for the
backdating scandal before other

00:09:01.957 --> 00:09:05.909
people did and then that was an
advantage.

00:09:05.909 --> 00:09:09.629
I'll give another example of
Redleaf's success.

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:11.595
General Motors,
as you know,

00:09:11.595 --> 00:09:15.817
is an auto producer in the
United States and it hasn't been

00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:19.232
doing well,
as you may have heard--as is

00:09:19.232 --> 00:09:22.799
the general auto industry in
this country;

00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:25.639
it's suffering under
competition from abroad.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:29.221
So, Andrew Redleaf bought
General Motors bonds,

00:09:29.221 --> 00:09:33.269
which were selling at a
discount because people worry

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:37.629
that General Motors wouldn't be
able to pay on them,

00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:41.210
and then he asked to speak to
the General Motors management.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:45.031
He went there and he made a
plea that General Motors should

00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:47.996
cut its dividend that it pays to
stockholders,

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:50.500
which is a reasonable thing to
do.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.665
If they're failing they should
cut their dividend,

00:09:53.665 --> 00:09:57.669
but companies are reluctant to
do that because it looks bad,

00:09:57.669 --> 00:10:01.509
so they hold off for a long
time, not cutting.

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:04.381
Redleaf went in and said,
you should really do it and he

00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:06.731
convinced them,
apparently, and they cut their

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:08.502
dividend.
Well after that,

00:10:08.502 --> 00:10:12.598
the bond price went up because
people saw that as a sign that

00:10:12.598 --> 00:10:16.694
the company was tightening its
belt and doing things right to

00:10:16.694 --> 00:10:19.629
have money to pay off the
bondholders;

00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:22.436
so it was self-interested,
I suppose--maybe you can ask

00:10:22.436 --> 00:10:25.205
him about this.
But it was also what we call

00:10:25.205 --> 00:10:29.312
shareholder activism or investor
activism--that he was getting

00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:33.149
involved in changing the way
corporations do business.

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:39.339
Those are just a couple of
examples of Redleaf and what he

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:42.450
does.
I admire him;

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:48.024
I think he has--it's his
curiosity and diligence that--he

00:10:48.024 --> 00:10:53.148
finds investment opportunities.
He's another example that

00:10:53.148 --> 00:10:55.649
markets are really not
efficient.

00:10:55.649 --> 00:11:01.655
They're efficient enough that
you have to work hard to find

00:11:01.655 --> 00:11:05.279
opportunities,
but not perfectly.

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:10.137
Today I want to talk about
banking and this ties in

00:11:10.137 --> 00:11:15.196
somewhat to my previous lecture,
which was on real estate,

00:11:15.196 --> 00:11:19.342
because banks are major real
estate lenders and investors in

00:11:19.342 --> 00:11:23.363
real estate securities.
We're going through a subprime

00:11:23.363 --> 00:11:26.654
crisis right now,
which is a banking crisis as

00:11:26.654 --> 00:11:31.877
well.
I will talk a little bit about

00:11:31.877 --> 00:11:39.749
what we discussed last time.
Anyway, I want to start out

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:45.900
with the most fundamental thing:
what are banks?

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.140
What is a bank?

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.180
Historically,
money lenders of one sort or

00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.460
another go back--who knows how
far back--thousands of years.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.710
So, you might say,
banks existed in ancient times.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:09.153
The history of banking often
goes back only a matter of

00:12:09.153 --> 00:12:13.748
hundreds of years.
One of the stories that is

00:12:13.748 --> 00:12:19.500
often told is the goldsmith
banker's story that goes back I

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.169
don't know how many hundred
years.

00:12:23.169 --> 00:12:27.409
Goldsmiths are people who work
in gold;

00:12:27.409 --> 00:12:31.130
they make jewelry and
gold--goldware and

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:36.240
whatever--coffee urns.
They would store gold and they

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.659
would have a safe or some sort
of safekeeping.

00:12:40.659 --> 00:12:45.418
A lot of people would ask them,
since they had a safekeeping

00:12:45.418 --> 00:12:49.210
for gold, could you put my gold
in your safe?

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:55.352
The goldsmith would accept that
as part of an extension of the

00:12:55.352 --> 00:12:57.970
business as a goldsmith,

00:13:03.409 --> 00:13:07.009
especially if the gold was in
the form of coins and people

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:10.230
didn't care whether they got the
same coins back.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:15.035
The goldsmith then discovered,
all this gold sitting in my

00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:20.090
safe is just sitting there.
Why I don't lend some of it out

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:24.470
and I can earn interest on the
loan and make money.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:29.118
Meanwhile, when people come
back to ask for their gold,

00:13:29.118 --> 00:13:33.250
as long as they're willing to
take other gold,

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.342
that's apparently what
they--they don't care whether

00:13:35.342 --> 00:13:37.694
they are the same coins.
I'll have enough,

00:13:37.694 --> 00:13:41.170
still, in my safe so that I can
pay them off.

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:46.696
So, it kind of just happened.
It would happen to anyone who

00:13:46.696 --> 00:13:50.876
was a goldsmith because it's
just the logical extension of

00:13:50.876 --> 00:13:54.180
the business.
Some customers want to use your

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:58.372
safe because safes are hard and
expensive to get and some--and

00:13:58.372 --> 00:14:01.929
then you've got all this gold,
so you might as well lend it

00:14:01.929 --> 00:14:05.444
out.
It started out that was as,

00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:09.580
what we call,
fractional reserve.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:17.877
That is, the goldsmith only had
a fraction of the gold that was

00:14:17.877 --> 00:14:24.274
owed by the goldsmith.
The goldsmith might also write

00:14:24.274 --> 00:14:30.963
notes promising so much gold and
not promising the return of any

00:14:30.963 --> 00:14:35.937
particular item of gold.
So, the goldsmith would sign

00:14:35.937 --> 00:14:39.475
his name on it saying,
I promise to give so many

00:14:39.475 --> 00:14:42.366
ounces of gold.
In some cases,

00:14:42.366 --> 00:14:48.586
they were bearer notes.
That means that the goldsmith

00:14:48.586 --> 00:14:52.759
would pay it to the bearer.
In other cases,

00:14:52.759 --> 00:14:55.029
they would have the name of the
person on them.

00:14:55.029 --> 00:14:57.529
Bearer notes became very
important.

00:14:57.529 --> 00:15:01.374
The goldsmith in your town
writes out a note saying,

00:15:01.374 --> 00:15:05.144
I will pay to the bearer of
this note so much gold,

00:15:05.144 --> 00:15:08.159
and then the bearer could be
anyone.

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:12.060
You still have to hide the note
from theft, but at least you

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.629
don't have to hide a whole bunch
of gold from theft.

00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:19.667
That's how paper money got
started, as bearer notes,

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:24.180
because if you had gold with
the goldsmith you could spend

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.747
the note,
at least within the town that

00:15:26.747 --> 00:15:30.139
you live in where the goldsmith
was known and had a reputation.

00:15:30.139 --> 00:15:36.890
So, that's the whole idea of
how banking got started,

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:44.159
and how paper money got
started, at least in the West.

00:15:44.159 --> 00:15:47.450
There's a different history in
China.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:53.982
There are different kinds of
banks today--I'm going to jump

00:15:53.982 --> 00:15:58.924
to modern times.
The most important kind is

00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:01.840
called a commercial bank.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.483
A commercial bank,
like a goldsmith banker,

00:16:10.483 --> 00:16:16.661
accepts deposits--that's
critical--and that means you can

00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:21.860
put money in the bank.
And it makes loans--very simple.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:29.957
It pays interest on the deposit
and it collects interest on the

00:16:29.957 --> 00:16:33.484
loans and it charges a higher
interest on the loan than they

00:16:33.484 --> 00:16:37.010
pay on the deposit.
The difference is their profit;

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:43.470
that's how they make money.
In addition to commercial

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:53.261
banks--well, I'm not going to
talk about investment banks

00:16:53.261 --> 00:16:55.929
here;
that's another lecture.

00:16:55.929 --> 00:16:59.663
Investment banks are very
different in that a pure

00:16:59.663 --> 00:17:04.158
investment bank does not accept
deposits and it doesn't make

00:17:04.158 --> 00:17:06.378
loans;
it's an underwriter for

00:17:06.378 --> 00:17:08.747
securities.
I'm not talking about

00:17:08.747 --> 00:17:13.341
investment banks in this--I'm
talking about commercial banks,

00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:16.480
which accept deposits from
depositors.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.368
Traditionally,
commercial banks did not deal

00:17:20.368 --> 00:17:25.491
with the general public;
they were for wealthy people

00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:29.671
and business people.
The traditional commercial bank

00:17:29.671 --> 00:17:33.331
would accept deposits from
businesses and make loans to

00:17:33.331 --> 00:17:37.959
businesses.
The other kinds of depository

00:17:37.959 --> 00:17:45.444
institutions that have developed
are called thrifts and they

00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:52.549
really started from a movement
in the United Kingdom.

00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:55.108
That's the way I do the
history--it may have some other

00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:58.926
version if you look further.
But in the United Kingdom,

00:17:58.926 --> 00:18:04.271
there was a movement in the
early nineteenth century to set

00:18:04.271 --> 00:18:09.155
up savings banks which were
for--this was an effort to

00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:13.712
democratize finance,
as I would put it--for ordinary

00:18:13.712 --> 00:18:17.710
people to have the opportunity
to make small deposits.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.429
It used to be that people would
hide money in their house and it

00:18:21.429 --> 00:18:25.089
would frequently get stolen and
it didn't earn any interest.

00:18:25.089 --> 00:18:29.692
So, there was a savings bank
movement, which spread from the

00:18:29.692 --> 00:18:33.220
U.K.
to the U.S.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.390
in the nineteenth century and
it was a philanthropic movement.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:38.971
In other words,
wealthy people,

00:18:38.971 --> 00:18:43.705
in an effort to alleviate
penury, would create a savings

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.273
bank.
For example,

00:18:45.273 --> 00:18:48.378
here in New Haven,
we had one created called The

00:18:48.378 --> 00:18:51.947
New Haven Savings Bank,
which lasted for over a hundred

00:18:51.947 --> 00:18:55.443
years and was taken over.
It's now called NewAlliance

00:18:55.443 --> 00:18:58.599
Bank;
it's no longer a saving bank.

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:04.570
A lot of these savings banks
tend to be very old institutions

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.650
that go back to the nineteenth
century.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:17.480
Another example is the Saving
and Loan Association.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.630
This is also--I keep thinking
how British we are;

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.851
this is New England and this is
the United States,

00:19:27.851 --> 00:19:31.083
a former British colony.
A lot of things that we do here

00:19:31.083 --> 00:19:35.519
have origins in Britain.
This also came from a U.K.

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:38.727
movement called The Building
Society Movement,

00:19:38.727 --> 00:19:43.150
which spread to the U.S.
Savings and Loans are the same

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:47.692
as Building Societies,
but the idea--the original idea

00:19:47.692 --> 00:19:52.405
and also the general idea
today--is that these are banks

00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:57.890
set up for small savers in order
that they can buy a house.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.682
So Savings and Loans,
traditionally,

00:20:00.682 --> 00:20:05.630
have made most of their loans
in the form of home mortgages.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.277
The idea was that a lot of
people can't afford a

00:20:09.277 --> 00:20:13.389
house--let's all get together
and pool our money--in a

00:20:13.389 --> 00:20:18.200
Building Society or Saving and
Loan Association--and then we'll

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.769
loan out to some of us to buy
the house.

00:20:21.769 --> 00:20:25.506
It will help,
rather than all trying to do it

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:30.490
individually.
There's also something called

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.410
credit unions.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:41.377
Credit unions are--I think they
came out of kind of the

00:20:41.377 --> 00:20:44.295
cooperative movement.
There are lots of social

00:20:44.295 --> 00:20:46.950
movements that have some
idealism behind them.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:51.405
I think maybe the same movement
that created the Yale

00:20:51.405 --> 00:20:56.717
Cooperative Society in the late
nineteenth century also spurred

00:20:56.717 --> 00:21:00.981
credit unions.
The credit union is a kind of

00:21:00.981 --> 00:21:06.612
club of people who belong to
some organization or live in one

00:21:06.612 --> 00:21:12.243
town or somehow connected that
is supposed to accept deposits

00:21:12.243 --> 00:21:16.559
and make loans to the members
for things,

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:20.138
including home mortgages,
but going broader than that

00:21:20.138 --> 00:21:22.674
into automobile loans.
Well, it wouldn't have been

00:21:22.674 --> 00:21:24.049
automobile loans when these were
created;

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:27.256
I don't know,
something loans,

00:21:27.256 --> 00:21:30.157
etc.
It's like a Savings and Loan

00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:34.631
Association except that credit
unions are created by some

00:21:34.631 --> 00:21:36.389
entity,
some club or group,

00:21:36.389 --> 00:21:38.509
and they're not open to the
whole public.

00:21:38.509 --> 00:21:42.361
Saving and Loan Associations,
by the way, no longer

00:21:42.361 --> 00:21:47.213
exclusively limit themselves to
mortgage lending--either they do

00:21:47.213 --> 00:21:52.220
home improvement lending and
auto loans and the like as well.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:22:00.313
I wanted to give you some idea
of the size of these so I have

00:22:00.313 --> 00:22:07.867
data on the total assets of
these classes of banks in the

00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:15.150
United States as of 2007,
third quarter--that's my date.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:25.733
Commercial banks had $10,872
billion in assets--or that's

00:22:25.733 --> 00:22:35.750
10.8 trillion dollars of assets
at the end of 2007;

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.329
about 20% of that is actually
foreign.

00:22:38.329 --> 00:22:43.620
We've had a lot of big foreign
commercial banks come into the

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.641
U.S.
It's not as big as in some

00:22:46.641 --> 00:22:49.796
other countries.
If you go down to Mexico,

00:22:49.796 --> 00:22:53.520
their main commercial banks are
almost entirely foreign today,

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.909
but in the U.S.
it stands at--the domestic

00:22:58.909 --> 00:23:08.807
figure of commercial banks--the
assets of domestic commercial

00:23:08.807 --> 00:23:16.891
banks is $7,987 billion so
that's about 8 trillion

00:23:16.891 --> 00:23:25.140
dollars--that's domestic banks.
Those are the big ones.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.573
If you look atâ€“now,
I have these two lumped

00:23:28.573 --> 00:23:31.359
together;
I don't have them separately.

00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:37.395
In 2007, third quarter,
they were $1.868

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:44.359
trillion--that's almost 2
trillion dollars,

00:23:44.359 --> 00:23:47.411
so they're much
smaller--savings banks and

00:23:47.411 --> 00:23:50.910
savings and loans--than the
commercial banks.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:57.393
The credit unions are even
smaller, $748 billion--so it's

00:23:57.393 --> 00:24:02.140
less than $1 trillion in credit
unions.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:06.284
When we speak of banks,
it is overwhelmingly commercial

00:24:06.284 --> 00:24:12.724
banks that matter.
There's another way to rank

00:24:12.724 --> 00:24:19.531
these: by number of banks;
that gives you a very different

00:24:19.531 --> 00:24:21.625
look.
If you look at number of

00:24:21.625 --> 00:24:25.580
organizations that do this
business, it comes completely

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:30.110
reversed and it's credit unions
that are the most important.

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:35.293
Where do I have that here?
I don't have the latest

00:24:35.293 --> 00:24:39.777
data--this is from 1998--but
there were 11,000 credit

00:24:39.777 --> 00:24:44.520
unions--that's the number of
credit unions in the United

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:50.040
States in 1998--and there were
only 9,000 commercial banks;

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.597
that's the number of banks.
Of the savings institutions,

00:24:55.597 --> 00:25:00.170
there were only 1,500;
that's probably going down

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.986
further because a lot of these
old savings banks are being

00:25:03.986 --> 00:25:09.295
converted into commercial banks.
You may have a false impression

00:25:09.295 --> 00:25:12.740
of the importance of credit
unions.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:16.130
You hear about credit unions a
lot because they're in your

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:18.807
neighborhood and they're
advertising for small

00:25:18.807 --> 00:25:22.874
depositors,
so they're in your face,

00:25:22.874 --> 00:25:30.150
but commercial banks are
actually much more important.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:35.220
I want to clarify just what it
is that banks do.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:39.318
They're in a--the first thing
to understand is that--I start

00:25:39.318 --> 00:25:43.140
out by telling you the story of
the goldsmith banker.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.674
I like to tell that story
because it sounds obvious that

00:25:46.674 --> 00:25:50.657
if you were a goldsmith hundreds
of years of ago you would have

00:25:50.657 --> 00:25:54.448
probably become a banker--it
would just be the natural thing

00:25:54.448 --> 00:25:57.298
to do.
So, banks are natural and

00:25:57.298 --> 00:26:01.869
fractional reserve banking is
the natural thing to do.

00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:05.740
Hence, it exists in every
country of the world;

00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:12.339
it's everywhere and so it's not
something we can live without.

00:26:12.339 --> 00:26:20.499
There must be fundamental
reasons for it and I wanted to

00:26:20.499 --> 00:26:29.400
go over some of the fundamental
reasons why we have banks.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.071
I've got three main reasons,
they're: adverse selection,

00:26:34.071 --> 00:26:36.619
moral hazard,
and liquidity.

00:26:36.619 --> 00:26:42.664
In other words,
the banks offer solutions to

00:26:42.664 --> 00:26:50.958
all three problems--adverse
selection--and I'll define these

00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:58.690
in a minute--moral hazard in
lending and liquidity.

00:27:04.829 --> 00:27:09.073
This goes beyond the simple
goldsmith banker story that I

00:27:09.073 --> 00:27:13.328
was motivating initially.
What do I mean by adverse

00:27:13.328 --> 00:27:16.817
selection?
The adverse selection problem,

00:27:16.817 --> 00:27:20.846
when it comes to
borrowers--people who are trying

00:27:20.846 --> 00:27:26.049
to borrow money--is that if you
become a lender--let's say,

00:27:26.049 --> 00:27:28.430
if you--not talking about
becoming a lender.

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:35.187
Suppose you are interested in
investing in debt of companies,

00:27:35.187 --> 00:27:41.719
then you as an investor are
subject to the problem that you

00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:48.589
might end up with the worst
stuff if you don't watch out.

00:27:48.589 --> 00:27:52.538
Suppose you are a naïve
investor and you say,

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:56.083
okay I'm going to invest in
companies' paper,

00:27:56.083 --> 00:27:59.710
which is their promise to
pay--their IOU.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.365
But the problem is,
I, being a naïve investor,

00:28:03.365 --> 00:28:06.069
could get stuck with the bad
stuff.

00:28:06.069 --> 00:28:10.561
The people who are in the
know--know who's trustworthy as

00:28:10.561 --> 00:28:15.454
a borrower and who has a good
prospect of paying it back--if I

00:28:15.454 --> 00:28:19.888
go in there ignorantly,
I'm going to get stuck with the

00:28:19.888 --> 00:28:23.294
worst stuff.
That's adverse selection--that

00:28:23.294 --> 00:28:27.958
you worry that someone is not
going to--you can't judge it

00:28:27.958 --> 00:28:32.872
well yourself,
so your inability to judge the

00:28:32.872 --> 00:28:39.683
ability of a company to pay
makes it very difficult for you

00:28:39.683 --> 00:28:41.210
to invest.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.905
This leads us to what is called
relationship banking--or it's

00:28:55.905 --> 00:28:59.289
really all banking is,
relationship banking.

00:28:59.289 --> 00:29:04.819
The core of banking is
relationship banking.

00:29:04.819 --> 00:29:09.295
Banks are institutions that
exist within the community and

00:29:09.295 --> 00:29:14.006
they live among the business
people in the community and have

00:29:14.006 --> 00:29:16.990
an ongoing relationship with
them.

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:23.358
In fact, that is essential to
banking and it's kind of part of

00:29:23.358 --> 00:29:29.309
the--you might almost call it
the definition of a bank.

00:29:29.309 --> 00:29:33.609
Bankers play golf a lot because
business people like to play

00:29:33.609 --> 00:29:37.689
golf and you have to keep your
finger on the pulse of the

00:29:37.689 --> 00:29:40.144
community.
Playing golf with the local

00:29:40.144 --> 00:29:43.543
businessmen is a very good thing
to do if you're a banker because

00:29:43.543 --> 00:29:46.943
you'll hear the gossip and it'll
all be off-the-cuff--things that

00:29:46.943 --> 00:29:50.183
no one would want to tell you
because they wouldn't want to be

00:29:50.183 --> 00:29:53.317
on-record of having called you
up and told you that such and

00:29:53.317 --> 00:29:56.451
such a company is in trouble or
that they're doing something

00:29:56.451 --> 00:29:59.160
that I think looks a little
funny to me.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.113
You can't call up the banker
and say that,

00:30:02.113 --> 00:30:06.579
but if you're playing golf it
comes out perfectly naturally.

00:30:06.579 --> 00:30:11.110
Or you join the Yale Club in
New York and you sit around and

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:14.888
talk with people.
I remember reading a--I like to

00:30:14.888 --> 00:30:19.151
browse among old books--I was
reading a nineteenth century

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:22.350
book about how to be a banker.
The book stressed,

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.690
you've just got to be
available.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.907
You're sitting there behind
your glass window and someone

00:30:26.907 --> 00:30:30.010
comes in and wants to chat,
you should be available;

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.132
that's what banking is.
You're kind of in this--but

00:30:34.132 --> 00:30:36.148
you're in a different thing.
You're not a regular

00:30:36.148 --> 00:30:38.613
businessman running a business;
you're a lender to the

00:30:38.613 --> 00:30:40.177
businesses.
As a result,

00:30:40.177 --> 00:30:44.337
people invest in banks--the
stock of banks--because they

00:30:44.337 --> 00:30:48.648
understand that these people
have a long-term relationship

00:30:48.648 --> 00:30:52.354
with business and they are
immune from the adverse

00:30:52.354 --> 00:30:55.872
selection.
You can't stick your bad paper

00:30:55.872 --> 00:30:59.369
to the banker who knows
everybody in the town;

00:30:59.369 --> 00:31:05.583
he'll figure it out and that's
the--and so that's the problem

00:31:05.583 --> 00:31:10.661
that's solved by bankers.
The other thing is moral

00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:16.174
hazard--this is that companies,
once they borrow money from

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:18.553
anybody,
a bank or anyone else,

00:31:18.553 --> 00:31:22.009
they have an obligation,
which is fixed in dollar terms.

00:31:22.009 --> 00:31:28.284
They have an incentive to take
big risks because--think of it

00:31:28.284 --> 00:31:34.349
this way--suppose you're a
company that has just borrowed a

00:31:34.349 --> 00:31:40.518
million dollars and now it's
looking a little bit precarious

00:31:40.518 --> 00:31:45.119
here that our business might go
under.

00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:48.661
You have an incentive to say,
because you're the equity

00:31:48.661 --> 00:31:51.220
holder, you have an incentive to
say,

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:55.561
hey why don't I just take some
big gamble here and not tell

00:31:55.561 --> 00:31:57.994
anybody.
I'll just take the remaining

00:31:57.994 --> 00:32:01.423
money and I'll put it in some
lottery bet and one in three

00:32:01.423 --> 00:32:03.950
chance I'll have three million
dollars.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.600
If it fails,
those guys will lose out

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.150
because I'm going to lose
anyway.

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.594
I might as well--if I don't do
anything, I'm going to lose

00:32:13.594 --> 00:32:15.335
anyway.
I'm just going to be paying

00:32:15.335 --> 00:32:18.297
back my debts and go bankrupt,
so I'll take a big gamble and

00:32:18.297 --> 00:32:21.410
then at least I have a one in
three chance of making money.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.449
You see that?
Isn't that a compelling

00:32:23.449 --> 00:32:25.220
argument?
That's what you want to do?

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.794
Businesses of course can't
actually invest in the

00:32:28.794 --> 00:32:33.411
lottery--that would be contrary
to the terms of their loan--but

00:32:33.411 --> 00:32:37.287
they can do similar things.
They can do big gamble type

00:32:37.287 --> 00:32:41.426
business ventures.
Again, that is a problem that

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:47.708
lenders have--that the company
that's borrowing the money has

00:32:47.708 --> 00:32:52.407
this unfortunate incentive,
at least at certain times,

00:32:52.407 --> 00:32:56.121
to take excessive risks because
the debtors will end up bearing

00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:58.245
the losses.
Not the debtors,

00:32:58.245 --> 00:33:02.666
the creditors who lent the
money will end up bearing the

00:33:02.666 --> 00:33:05.981
losses.
This is another reason why we

00:33:05.981 --> 00:33:10.035
want relationship banking.
It's exactly what you find out

00:33:10.035 --> 00:33:13.180
about when you're playing golf
with the other bankers.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:19.048
You're on the phone with this
guy all the time and you sniff

00:33:19.048 --> 00:33:22.630
something out,
you can maybe stop.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:25.770
So, you're watching over the
company.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:35.911
The third thing is liquidity.
That is--maybe this goes back

00:33:35.911 --> 00:33:40.395
to the--I didn't mention it,
but it would apply to the old

00:33:40.395 --> 00:33:49.162
goldsmith banker story as well.
Liquidity is that banks lend

00:33:49.162 --> 00:33:56.343
long and borrow
short--short-term,

00:33:56.343 --> 00:34:00.153
I mean.
Most of the people who want to

00:34:00.153 --> 00:34:02.548
borrow money from the
banks--let's talk about

00:34:02.548 --> 00:34:05.706
businesses--we're accepting
business loans--they don't want

00:34:05.706 --> 00:34:07.829
to have to pay the money
tomorrow.

00:34:07.829 --> 00:34:11.800
If you're borrowing money for a
business, you might want to open

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.330
a store and you'd want to stock
your merchandise and your

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.230
business won't prosper for a
couple years.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.918
Or, you might be building a
factory and you can't pay the

00:34:21.918 --> 00:34:25.694
money back right away.
You need the loan for years,

00:34:25.694 --> 00:34:30.239
but investors don't want to tie
up their money for years.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:34.815
What banks offer is
liquidity--the ability to borrow

00:34:34.815 --> 00:34:40.020
short even though the loans that
are made are long-term.

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:43.220
How do banks do it?
They do it with fractional

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.490
reserves.
They trust to the fact that the

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:51.876
depositors won't all come on the
same day, just like a goldsmith

00:34:51.876 --> 00:34:56.834
banker--he leaves only enough
gold in the safe to cover the

00:34:56.834 --> 00:35:01.280
kind of withdrawals that are
normally accepted.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.070
In that case,
the bank can pay interest to

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.705
depositors.
Even though the deposits are

00:35:09.705 --> 00:35:14.239
short-term and the depositor can
get the money at any time,

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:17.807
the depositor is earning
interest of a level that can

00:35:17.807 --> 00:35:22.592
only be made on long-term loans.
People can't pay--they can't

00:35:22.592 --> 00:35:27.409
pay a high interest if they
don't have it as a long-term

00:35:27.409 --> 00:35:29.724
loan.
Now incidentally,

00:35:29.724 --> 00:35:34.190
often bank loans to
corporations are short-term,

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:37.894
technically,
so the bank is both lending

00:35:37.894 --> 00:35:43.173
short and borrowing short.
In fact, they are in practice

00:35:43.173 --> 00:35:47.759
long-term because you have a
relationship with your banker

00:35:47.759 --> 00:35:51.702
and you play golf with your
banker and your banker

00:35:51.702 --> 00:35:56.530
understands that you have a
business--he's your friend,

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:59.305
let's hope.
Your banker understands that

00:35:59.305 --> 00:36:03.279
your business can't pay the
money back and that the bank has

00:36:03.279 --> 00:36:07.320
a reputation in the community of
helping business people,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:11.223
so they won't ask for the money
even though it's a short-term

00:36:11.223 --> 00:36:15.324
loan that they made to you.
The bank won't ask for it back

00:36:15.324 --> 00:36:18.349
right away unless you start
misbehaving.

00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:22.276
It becomes an arm-twisting
thing--because of this risk of

00:36:22.276 --> 00:36:25.222
moral hazard,
the bank has a threat to take

00:36:25.222 --> 00:36:29.078
the money back and they are
going to find out quickly if

00:36:29.078 --> 00:36:30.666
you,
as a company,

00:36:30.666 --> 00:36:33.582
are behaving wrong.
It works out,

00:36:33.582 --> 00:36:38.240
under normal circumstances,
very well.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.699
It goes beyond all of this.
The companies get advice from

00:36:42.699 --> 00:36:45.999
the banker as well.
The banker knows everybody in

00:36:45.999 --> 00:36:50.158
the community and when you're
playing golf with the banker,

00:36:50.158 --> 00:36:53.599
it may go beyond just
collecting information;

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:55.760
the banker might have positive
suggestions.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:59.070
You should really do business
with so and so,

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:01.929
who has a natural match up with
you.

00:37:01.929 --> 00:37:08.359
Bankers require a lot of
prestige and status in their

00:37:08.359 --> 00:37:14.721
communities;
so, this is happening all over

00:37:14.721 --> 00:37:19.850
the world.
Now, banking has a--it's

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:27.427
important to know that banking
is bigger in developing

00:37:27.427 --> 00:37:33.380
countries--I'll say LDCs,
less developed countries--than

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.369
in developed countries.
That is, it tends to be bigger

00:37:37.369 --> 00:37:41.660
and that is because less
developed countries have less

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.980
developed securities,
regulation and laws,

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:49.407
and traditions.
It often has to be that the

00:37:49.407 --> 00:37:55.960
only way you can raise money for
a business is through a bank.

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:00.559
In the more advanced countries,
there is more trust in the

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:03.787
securities markets,
so we don't need this

00:38:03.787 --> 00:38:12.096
relationship banking as much.
It still becomes very important

00:38:12.096 --> 00:38:17.941
to a lot of things.
I wanted to mention in this

00:38:17.941 --> 00:38:23.160
context, because I'm emphasizing
how banks help solve the adverse

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.563
selection and moral hazard
problem--I wanted to mention

00:38:27.563 --> 00:38:31.070
briefly here also the rating
agencies,

00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:34.860
which fulfill some of these
functions.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.349
I don't have a separate lecture
on these.

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:48.288
The first rating agency in the
world was created by Mr.

00:38:48.288 --> 00:38:55.500
John Moody, in the U.S.
in 1909.

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:59.306
He was dealing also with the
moral hazard and adverse

00:38:59.306 --> 00:39:04.655
selection problem.
He had a neat idea and that was

00:39:04.655 --> 00:39:11.047
to give letter grades to
securities that represented

00:39:11.047 --> 00:39:17.479
credit worthiness.
The highest grade was AAA and

00:39:17.479 --> 00:39:22.590
that was the best grade you
could get.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:24.935
There are no A+'s;
it sounds a little bit like

00:39:24.935 --> 00:39:28.603
college, but not quite.
Then, if you weren't quite AAA,

00:39:28.603 --> 00:39:33.731
you were AA and if you weren't
quite AA, you were A and then

00:39:33.731 --> 00:39:37.458
you could become BA.
Well, all the way down,

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:41.289
I guess, to C or beyond
that--then you're failing.

00:39:41.289 --> 00:39:43.750
It's just almost like college
grades.

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:49.115
The idea was that the--so he
set up Moody's Rating Agency and

00:39:49.115 --> 00:39:54.570
the job of Moody's was to give
letter grades to securities;

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:58.686
it was a little bit like a
bank, but it was different

00:39:58.686 --> 00:40:02.170
because he didn't actually make
the loans.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:08.718
There was another--Henry Poor
set up Poor's in 1916 on a

00:40:08.718 --> 00:40:15.743
similar model and they later
merged with Standard Statistics

00:40:15.743 --> 00:40:20.030
to become Standard &amp;
Poor's,

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.625
S&amp;P.
Those are the two biggest

00:40:23.625 --> 00:40:27.973
rating agencies in the U.S.
today and they're extremely

00:40:27.973 --> 00:40:32.923
powerful organizations because
they--Standard &amp;

00:40:32.923 --> 00:40:38.158
Poor's also does letter grades,
a slightly different system,

00:40:38.158 --> 00:40:40.655
but almost the same.
Then there's Fitch,

00:40:40.655 --> 00:40:43.136
who's the third,
which is smaller than these

00:40:43.136 --> 00:40:45.940
two.
This is an interesting

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:51.505
question: do they solve the
moral hazard and adverse

00:40:51.505 --> 00:40:55.980
selection problem as well as
banks do?

00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.242
Well, they're similar to banks
and they have a relationship

00:41:00.242 --> 00:41:04.578
with the investment community
and they try to stay on top of

00:41:04.578 --> 00:41:10.642
everything that's happening.
They've become forces of nature

00:41:10.642 --> 00:41:14.283
in the U.S.
economy, in the sense that

00:41:14.283 --> 00:41:19.030
people accept these letter
grades with great authority.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:24.719
Recently, however,
there is a bit of a scandal

00:41:24.719 --> 00:41:32.683
regarding these rating agencies
because they gave AAA ratings to

00:41:32.683 --> 00:41:37.845
some subprime securities.
In other words,

00:41:37.845 --> 00:41:43.630
securities that were themselves
backed by subprime loans.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:49.260
So, this is the subprime
scandal showing up.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:54.655
The question is:
how can these rating agencies

00:41:54.655 --> 00:42:00.530
manage the current distrust that
has developed?

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:06.680
Because they--one important
thing--John Moody was a very

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:12.719
crusty, strong-willed man,
who wrote a couple books.

00:42:12.719 --> 00:42:19.001
In these books he talked about
his moral commitment to honest

00:42:19.001 --> 00:42:23.529
rating of securities.
People trusted him and they

00:42:23.529 --> 00:42:26.880
trusted his organization.
Well, they still do massively,

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.889
although a little bit less than
they used to.

00:42:28.889 --> 00:42:33.607
John Moody died in the 1950s,
but after he died,

00:42:33.607 --> 00:42:39.127
Moody's and Standard &amp;
Poor did something that Moody

00:42:39.127 --> 00:42:45.451
would not have approved of--they
started accepting fees from the

00:42:45.451 --> 00:42:50.175
people they rate;
some people think that you

00:42:50.175 --> 00:42:53.408
shouldn't do that.
If you're--a professor

00:42:53.408 --> 00:42:57.280
shouldn't be paid by the
students, at least not directly.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.503
Maybe you're paying me
indirectly, but I shouldn't be

00:43:00.503 --> 00:43:03.789
collecting money from you and
then awarding grades;

00:43:03.789 --> 00:43:06.781
that wouldn't be right,
but that's what has started to

00:43:06.781 --> 00:43:09.168
happen.
Some people think that the

00:43:09.168 --> 00:43:13.429
rating agencies have allowed a
kind of moral hazard to creep

00:43:13.429 --> 00:43:16.921
into their organization.
They have been working on

00:43:16.921 --> 00:43:20.067
improving their methods and
they're trying to create

00:43:20.067 --> 00:43:23.274
divisions within their
organizations that prevent the

00:43:23.274 --> 00:43:28.002
moral hazard from happening.
I think that going forward,

00:43:28.002 --> 00:43:33.985
both the rating agencies and
the banks will be very important

00:43:33.985 --> 00:43:38.470
in our society.
The history of financial

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:45.309
innovation is always that the
organizations adapt to crisis.

00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:50.785
The subprime crisis is harming
both the banking sector and the

00:43:50.785 --> 00:43:56.350
rating agencies at the present
time because it's a situation of

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:00.389
stress that stresses their
organizations,

00:44:00.389 --> 00:44:06.310
but I think that it will be a
time of correction.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:10.020
I mentioned fractional reserves;

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:21.780
the fact that banks hold only a
part of their liabilities as

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.931
reserves, like the goldsmith
banker only holding part of the

00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:29.997
gold, is a problem.
The question is:

00:44:29.997 --> 00:44:32.510
how much reserves should a bank
hold?

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:35.791
Bank failures occur when
there's not enough gold in the

00:44:35.791 --> 00:44:39.072
vault and then people start
asking for the gold and the

00:44:39.072 --> 00:44:42.050
goldsmith banker doesn't have it
to give out.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:49.378
The Basel Accord was in 1988
and you can read about this in

00:44:49.378 --> 00:44:52.789
detail in Fabozzi,
et al.

00:44:52.789 --> 00:44:57.146
It was an international
convention that gave,

00:44:57.146 --> 00:45:01.898
what they called,
risk-based capital requirements

00:45:01.898 --> 00:45:07.244
and recommended risk-based
capital requirements to bank

00:45:07.244 --> 00:45:10.610
regulators around the world.

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:21.405
What we have--we have a problem
that there can be a systemic

00:45:21.405 --> 00:45:25.580
problem to fractional reserve
banking if there is ever a run

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:29.236
on the banking system.
If banks get in trouble and

00:45:29.236 --> 00:45:33.272
they can't pay out--if one bank
gets in trouble and can't pay

00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:36.772
out on its deposits,
then that can bring the whole

00:45:36.772 --> 00:45:40.948
system down because it can cause
a panic among investors--among

00:45:40.948 --> 00:45:44.449
depositors and banks--and create
a run on a bank.

00:45:44.449 --> 00:45:48.253
This has happened so many times
in history that governments

00:45:48.253 --> 00:45:52.057
around the world now regulate
banks and tell them that they

00:45:52.057 --> 00:45:55.926
have to hold a minimum amount of
reserves and have a minimum

00:45:55.926 --> 00:45:59.809
amount of capital.
Capital is the money that they

00:45:59.809 --> 00:46:04.275
have to pay out should there be
a--its assets that they can

00:46:04.275 --> 00:46:08.510
quickly liquefy and pay out
should there be a run on the

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:12.183
bank.
Basel 1988 was an effort to

00:46:12.183 --> 00:46:17.561
make sophisticated risk
management requirements for

00:46:17.561 --> 00:46:22.293
banks that relied on more
modern, as of 1988,

00:46:22.293 --> 00:46:28.550
financial theory.
The U.S.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:35.356
adopted the Basel requirements
in 1989 and they're still

00:46:35.356 --> 00:46:38.915
enforced today.
The agreement--But

00:46:38.915 --> 00:46:41.987
incidentally,
this was an international

00:46:41.987 --> 00:46:44.824
convention.
No country had to follow these

00:46:44.824 --> 00:46:47.608
risks, but generally,
countries have followed them

00:46:47.608 --> 00:46:51.131
because they want to be part of
the international community and

00:46:51.131 --> 00:46:54.369
you want to use the standards
that were recommended.

00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:58.207
It's a little bit like the
NAIC--the National Association

00:46:58.207 --> 00:47:01.085
of Insurance
Commissioners--recommends laws

00:47:01.085 --> 00:47:04.649
to the local insurance
regulators in the fifty United

00:47:04.649 --> 00:47:07.313
States.
This is a super national

00:47:07.313 --> 00:47:10.476
version of this.
Basel is a city in Switzerland,

00:47:10.476 --> 00:47:13.489
where the Bank for
International Settlements is.

00:47:13.489 --> 00:47:17.313
It's an international effort to
recommend regulations for

00:47:17.313 --> 00:47:22.695
countries all over the world.
In the Basel I there were Tier

00:47:22.695 --> 00:47:28.898
I capital requirements and--they
defined Tier I capital as

00:47:28.898 --> 00:47:34.884
capital in a certain form--it's
stockholders equity plus

00:47:34.884 --> 00:47:39.985
preferred stock.
Then there's Tier II capital

00:47:39.985 --> 00:47:43.303
and then they have a
formula--now,

00:47:43.303 --> 00:47:48.683
this is defined in Fabozzi.
They have a formula that

00:47:48.683 --> 00:47:54.689
defines how much Tier I and Tier
II capital a bank has to hold

00:47:54.689 --> 00:48:01.090
and the amount depends on the
risk class of their investments.

00:48:01.090 --> 00:48:06.926
They define four credit risk
categories and they define a

00:48:06.926 --> 00:48:12.346
formula involving the amount of
assets in each of the

00:48:12.346 --> 00:48:15.987
categories.
Then there's a formula that

00:48:15.987 --> 00:48:20.604
dictates how much Tier I capital
and how much Tier II capital

00:48:20.604 --> 00:48:25.416
they have to hold.
This system has worked well for

00:48:25.416 --> 00:48:31.499
twenty years now but it is being
superseded by another Basel

00:48:31.499 --> 00:48:37.582
Convention--Basel II--which has
been going on for some years

00:48:37.582 --> 00:48:42.988
now.
This is Basel I that I just was

00:48:42.988 --> 00:48:50.355
telling you about and now
they've come up with a new

00:48:50.355 --> 00:48:55.845
version, Basel II,
and Basel II is more

00:48:55.845 --> 00:49:01.731
sophisticated.
It recognizes that the risks

00:49:01.731 --> 00:49:07.902
that a bank faces are very
complex and that they are not

00:49:07.902 --> 00:49:14.634
summarized by just the classes
of borrowers that were defined

00:49:14.634 --> 00:49:19.320
in Basel I.
It took them years--I won't get

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:24.542
into details on Basel II,
but it won't get into--it tries

00:49:24.542 --> 00:49:30.137
to deal more sophisticatedly
with the complexity that we have

00:49:30.137 --> 00:49:35.545
in modern finance when there are
lots of unusual derivative

00:49:35.545 --> 00:49:41.420
securities that have difficult
to understand properties.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.306
I think they may have to have a
Basel III before too long

00:49:44.306 --> 00:49:47.449
because everything gets more and
more complex in the world.

00:49:47.449 --> 00:49:50.812
To some extent,
the subprime crisis is a

00:49:50.812 --> 00:49:54.950
failure of Basel II,
which is not even fully born

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.670
yet.
It won't come fully in force in

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:00.869
the U.S.
until 2009;

00:50:00.869 --> 00:50:03.579
it's already starting to have
its impact.

00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:06.910
It's in other countries--it's
already been adopted.

00:50:16.429 --> 00:50:19.388
I wanted to talk a little bit
about problems and then I'll

00:50:19.388 --> 00:50:23.689
conclude.
I have various--there have been

00:50:23.689 --> 00:50:30.907
lots of banking problems in the
world and let me just mention

00:50:30.907 --> 00:50:35.318
some.
I don't know what order I

00:50:35.318 --> 00:50:39.207
should go in here.
Let me just talk a little bit

00:50:39.207 --> 00:50:44.128
historically.
The S&amp;L Crisis in the

00:50:44.128 --> 00:50:51.539
United States,
1980s--what happened there?

00:50:51.539 --> 00:50:57.437
Saving and Loan Associations
were making bad loans,

00:50:57.437 --> 00:51:03.334
especially in Texas,
but in lots of other states as

00:51:03.334 --> 00:51:09.349
well--this is when Ronald Reagan
was President.

00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:11.909
Reagan was a big believer in
free markets;

00:51:11.909 --> 00:51:16.419
we had a law that actually
passed, it's called the

00:51:16.419 --> 00:51:20.928
Depository Institution's
Deregulation and Monetary

00:51:20.928 --> 00:51:25.989
Control Act of 1980--that's
actually before Reagan.

00:51:25.989 --> 00:51:32.030
That's Depository Institution's
Deregulation and Monetary

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:35.140
Control Act;
what that did was,

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:39.851
it eliminated ceilings on
interest rates--on deposits,

00:51:39.851 --> 00:51:44.030
it allowed banks to pay high
interest rates.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.594
It used to be that the
government didn't let banks pay

00:51:47.594 --> 00:51:51.563
more than a certain amount on
their deposits and that helped

00:51:51.563 --> 00:51:55.598
protect banks because then they
didn't have to compete to pay

00:51:55.598 --> 00:51:59.634
high interest rates--then be
incentivized to make risky loans

00:51:59.634 --> 00:52:03.670
to try to make money with those
high interest rates.

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:06.706
Once they freed up interest
rates, interest rates on

00:52:06.706 --> 00:52:10.039
deposits started soaring and
banks started taking greater

00:52:10.039 --> 00:52:12.539
risks, particularly Savings and
Loans.

00:52:12.539 --> 00:52:15.974
Now, the government insures
deposits, as you know,

00:52:15.974 --> 00:52:20.320
through the FDIC--the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.042
For Savings and Loans,
they had an organization called

00:52:24.042 --> 00:52:28.398
the FSLIC, which is now defunct
because of this crisis--Federal

00:52:28.398 --> 00:52:32.191
Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation--it was insuring

00:52:32.191 --> 00:52:36.628
deposits of Savings and Loans.
They should have been watching,

00:52:36.628 --> 00:52:39.091
under Reagan,
because if you let them pay

00:52:39.091 --> 00:52:42.785
high interest rates you better
watch out that they don't make

00:52:42.785 --> 00:52:45.310
risky loans if you're insuring
them.

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:51.658
But the FSLIC wasn't;
it was sleeping at the switch,

00:52:51.658 --> 00:52:56.653
so it allowed banks in the
United States--it was primarily

00:52:56.653 --> 00:53:01.647
Savings and Loans who did
this--to make bad loans and they

00:53:01.647 --> 00:53:05.239
were playing this moral hazard
game.

00:53:05.239 --> 00:53:08.806
The moral hazard crept in
because they said,

00:53:08.806 --> 00:53:11.710
hey we can borrow at a high
rate.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:15.860
Let's make some risky loans and
if it succeeds we make money;

00:53:15.860 --> 00:53:18.504
if the thing blows up,
well then they government will

00:53:18.504 --> 00:53:21.408
pay.
So, they had an unfortunate

00:53:21.408 --> 00:53:27.510
incentive to make bad loans.
This thing collapsed in the

00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:33.788
1980s and it cost the U.S.
Government, through the FSLIC,

00:53:33.788 --> 00:53:38.219
about 150 billion dollars.
The collapse of this was part

00:53:38.219 --> 00:53:41.070
of the reason for a general
economic collapse.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:49.125
We saw a collapse in real
estate prices after 1990 and a

00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:56.155
recession in 1991,
so it was the big story of the

00:53:56.155 --> 00:53:59.724
1980s.
I'm just going to mention some

00:53:59.724 --> 00:54:03.303
other stories that are
important, just to illustrate

00:54:03.303 --> 00:54:06.039
the fragility of the banking
system.

00:54:06.039 --> 00:54:14.460
The Mexican Crisis under
President Salinas.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.387
What happened was,
Salinas was a Harvard-educated

00:54:18.387 --> 00:54:21.928
economist;
he came in to modernize Mexico

00:54:21.928 --> 00:54:26.705
and he wanted to privatize
things, so he privatized a lot

00:54:26.705 --> 00:54:34.060
of the banks.
Then the banks went on a

00:54:34.060 --> 00:54:49.535
lending spree in Mexico and bank
loans rose from 10% of GDP--of

00:54:49.535 --> 00:54:59.269
Mexican GDP--in 1988 to 40% by
1994;

00:54:59.269 --> 00:55:02.210
that's a huge increase in bank
loans in Mexico.

00:55:02.210 --> 00:55:05.610
What was happening?
It was again--something was

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:09.750
amiss--that you had the
government deregulating and not

00:55:09.750 --> 00:55:12.156
watching.
A lot of these people in the

00:55:12.156 --> 00:55:14.758
Mexican banks thought,
well surely there will be a

00:55:14.758 --> 00:55:16.670
bailout if something bad
happens;

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:19.719
the government will pay for it,
so let's run with it.

00:55:19.719 --> 00:55:23.809
They ran with a lot of loans
that turned out bad.

00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:26.571
As a result,
there was a huge banking crisis

00:55:26.571 --> 00:55:30.296
and I mentioned before that
Mexico doesn't have much in the

00:55:30.296 --> 00:55:34.662
way of domestic banks anymore.
They basically all failed and

00:55:34.662 --> 00:55:38.952
were taken over by foreign banks
after the Mexican Crisis,

00:55:38.952 --> 00:55:42.489
so that's a sign of how things
can go amiss.

00:55:42.489 --> 00:55:49.130
The Asian Crisis in
1997â€“1998.

00:56:01.570 --> 00:56:07.576
It actually is a complex
phenomenon not involving only

00:56:07.576 --> 00:56:12.449
banks, but there was a--in the
mid-1990s,

00:56:12.449 --> 00:56:15.900
Korea, Taiwan,
Thailand, Philippines,

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:21.650
other countries were receiving
a lot of international capital

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:26.556
from international banks.
There was a sudden change of

00:56:26.556 --> 00:56:30.278
heart and people wanted to
withdraw their--foreign

00:56:30.278 --> 00:56:33.619
investors wanted to withdraw
their money.

00:56:33.619 --> 00:56:38.241
Once the rumor got started that
Asia was in trouble,

00:56:38.241 --> 00:56:42.773
these people started
withdrawing their money faster

00:56:42.773 --> 00:56:47.576
and faster and it caused
failures of domestic banks in

00:56:47.576 --> 00:56:57.087
these countries.
There's also the Argentine

00:56:57.087 --> 00:57:05.491
Crisis of 2000-2002.
Once again, I won't get into

00:57:05.491 --> 00:57:09.904
all the details of this,
but it ended up with a run on

00:57:09.904 --> 00:57:14.369
the Argentine banks.
Again, there was a loss of

00:57:14.369 --> 00:57:19.664
confidence in the time of an
economic crisis and people

00:57:19.664 --> 00:57:24.469
wanted to withdraw their money
from the banks.

00:57:24.469 --> 00:57:28.203
The government was panicked
because the banks didn't have

00:57:28.203 --> 00:57:33.248
enough money to give it to them,
so the government shut down the

00:57:33.248 --> 00:57:37.909
bank accounts and it led to
rioting in the streets.

00:57:37.909 --> 00:57:40.958
People were very upset that
they had left their money in the

00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:44.110
bank and the government was just
saying, you can't have it.

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:49.389
It caused a huge economic
crisis as well;

00:57:49.389 --> 00:57:51.610
the unemployment rate rose to
18%.

00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:57.719
There were five changes of
government in Argentina in a

00:57:57.719 --> 00:58:00.346
short time.
Fortunately,

00:58:00.346 --> 00:58:04.970
Argentina has survived this
crisis pretty well;

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:10.821
it's coming back rapidly.
There was a severe crisis and

00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:16.024
so that again highlights the
importance of having good bank

00:58:16.024 --> 00:58:18.175
regulation.
Now finally,

00:58:18.175 --> 00:58:21.981
I want to talk about the
current situation in what's

00:58:21.981 --> 00:58:28.020
called the subprime crisis.
Let me talk about the U.S.

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:30.286
first.
In the U.S.â€“now,

00:58:30.286 --> 00:58:34.185
I'm talking about just the last
few years and something that's

00:58:34.185 --> 00:58:37.510
continuing today--and it's
international as well.

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:42.674
There developed, in the U.S.
in recent years,

00:58:42.674 --> 00:58:45.300
something called the Shadow
Banking System.

00:58:51.179 --> 00:58:55.760
These are organizations that
act like banks but are not

00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:00.085
called banks because they are
not technically banks,

00:59:00.085 --> 00:59:05.232
so they escape regulation.
Typically they issue,

00:59:05.232 --> 00:59:09.693
instead of deposits,
something called

00:59:09.693 --> 00:59:14.773
ABS--Asset-Backed
Securities--particularly

00:59:14.773 --> 00:59:20.862
commercial paper,
which are short-term

00:59:20.862 --> 00:59:29.690
obligations of the organization.
They invest in something

00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:34.610
long-term--notably,
subprime loans.

00:59:40.449 --> 00:59:43.913
They're operating like banks,
but they're not regulated as

00:59:43.913 --> 00:59:47.559
banks, so Basel II doesn't apply
to them and they can do what

00:59:47.559 --> 00:59:49.761
they want.
Unfortunately,

00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:54.974
what we've seen recently is a
kind of a bank run on the

00:59:54.974 --> 01:00:00.953
asset-backed commercial paper.
Banks have been creating

01:00:00.953 --> 01:00:07.472
something called Structured
Investment Vehicles in recent

01:00:07.472 --> 01:00:09.479
years.
What these are,

01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:12.998
they're like companies but they
typically don't have any

01:00:12.998 --> 01:00:16.907
employees.
An SIV is a company of a sort

01:00:16.907 --> 01:00:22.318
that invests in assets and they
issue something like

01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:28.052
asset-backed commercial paper,
but it's not a real company

01:00:28.052 --> 01:00:32.848
because it only exists as an
organization sponsored by some

01:00:32.848 --> 01:00:36.010
bank.
So, the bank has an SIV on its

01:00:36.010 --> 01:00:41.179
books, but the SIV is not part
of the bank, so it's not subject

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:44.179
to the bank capital
requirements.

01:00:44.179 --> 01:00:47.386
Then you know,
you might say,

01:00:47.386 --> 01:00:51.510
who would buy the paper of an
SIV?

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:54.855
Well, the only people who would
buy it are people who trust the

01:00:54.855 --> 01:00:57.024
bank that supports it,
so in effect,

01:00:57.024 --> 01:01:01.060
the bank is promising to bail
out the SIV if it should get in

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.570
trouble.
So, it really is--it really

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:07.309
ought to be on the bank's
balance sheet and it ought to be

01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:09.670
regulated by the bank
regulators,

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:15.471
but there was a failure to do
that and that is the problem

01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:20.257
that we are in currently.
I wanted to talk about some

01:01:20.257 --> 01:01:24.180
very recent problems to
illustrate that it's always a

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:29.010
challenge to keep banks--banks
are extremely useful entities,

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:32.699
but there's sort of a
fundamental flaw that has to be

01:01:32.699 --> 01:01:37.202
constantly dealt with--namely,
the tendency of them to fail

01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:40.949
when they're lending long and
borrowing short.

01:01:40.949 --> 01:01:43.857
There's always a risk that
investors will suddenly want

01:01:43.857 --> 01:01:48.169
their money back.
I wanted to just talk about

01:01:48.169 --> 01:01:52.603
some recent examples.
Northern Rock,

01:01:52.603 --> 01:01:58.864
which was a building society in
the United Kingdom,

01:01:58.864 --> 01:02:04.250
had a sudden bank run in
September 2007.

01:02:09.820 --> 01:02:12.230
The Northern--what was
happening?

01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:15.881
Northern Rock was a British
building society that was

01:02:15.881 --> 01:02:18.760
investing in subprime paper in
the U.S.

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.425
So, it was having trouble and
word got out that it was having

01:02:22.425 --> 01:02:26.151
trouble and the rumors started
spreading in the U.K.--Northern

01:02:26.151 --> 01:02:30.372
Rock is going to fail.
So, people started rushing to

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:35.909
pull all their money out of
Northern Rock in September 2007.

01:02:35.909 --> 01:02:39.120
This was the first bank run in
the U.K.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:42.601
since 1866.
This was a tremendous

01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:45.973
embarrassment to the Bank of
England and Mervyn King,

01:02:45.973 --> 01:02:49.539
who was a very good governor of
the Bank of England;

01:02:49.539 --> 01:02:51.539
but this apparently took him by
surprise.

01:02:51.539 --> 01:02:54.690
They thought bank runs were a
thing of the past.

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:58.670
In fact, the United Kingdom has
been an international model for

01:02:58.670 --> 01:03:02.523
preventing bank runs because the
Bank of England would always

01:03:02.523 --> 01:03:06.054
lend to a bank that was in
trouble in order to keep them

01:03:06.054 --> 01:03:08.530
out of the problem.
The U.S.

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:11.947
Federal Reserve System was
really a copy of the Bank of

01:03:11.947 --> 01:03:14.676
England--thinking that,
well, the Bank of England

01:03:14.676 --> 01:03:16.969
managed to prevent bank runs for
all these years,

01:03:16.969 --> 01:03:19.712
let's create the Fed,
which we'll talk about again

01:03:19.712 --> 01:03:22.763
later.
They thought they had the

01:03:22.763 --> 01:03:27.136
system solved,
but then they had a bank run

01:03:27.136 --> 01:03:30.730
last year.
You talk to these people who

01:03:30.730 --> 01:03:33.610
were standing in front of the
bank;

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:36.704
the first question you'd ask
them, aren't deposits insured in

01:03:36.704 --> 01:03:38.640
the U.K.
like they are in the U.S.?

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:42.040
Well, sure enough they were.
The U.K.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.981
had copied the U.S.
idea--I guess they copied--I

01:03:44.981 --> 01:03:47.910
don't know where the original--I
think it's probably--is it U.K.

01:03:47.910 --> 01:03:49.840
copying the U.S.
in this case?

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:56.216
But they didn't copy it well
enough because they had a limit

01:03:56.216 --> 01:04:03.132
on the insurance of £3,000
for full insurance and then they

01:04:03.132 --> 01:04:08.320
had 90% of the deposits up to
£75,000.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.441
You go out to these people who
are lining up in front of the

01:04:11.441 --> 01:04:14.140
bank and ask them,
isn't there deposit insurance?

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.521
They knew perfectly well.
They said, yes but only up to

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:20.679
£3,000--I don't want to
lose 10% of my money,

01:04:20.679 --> 01:04:23.079
I've got £50,000 in the
bank.

01:04:23.079 --> 01:04:27.187
It was kind of a bad design for
deposit insurance,

01:04:27.187 --> 01:04:31.519
so they fixed it.
But still, Northern Rock is in

01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:36.906
such trouble that in February of
'08--that's last month--the

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:41.380
British Government nationalized
Northern Rock.

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.643
It's in a terrible mess.
This puts the British

01:04:44.643 --> 01:04:49.514
Government in an embarrassing
situation of owning a failing

01:04:49.514 --> 01:04:52.725
mortgage lender,
so they've got to now be the

01:04:52.725 --> 01:04:55.380
government collecting on all
these mortgages;

01:04:55.380 --> 01:05:00.251
it's a mess.
It shows that little details

01:05:00.251 --> 01:05:04.940
about how the deposit insurance
is run are important.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:12.429
I wanted to talk about Germany.
In August, or actually it was a

01:05:12.429 --> 01:05:22.285
little bit earlier--July.
There's a bank in Germany

01:05:22.285 --> 01:05:33.763
called IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG that invested

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:40.360
heavily in U.S.
subprime paper.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:46.148
The value of the paper
collapsed and the bank became

01:05:46.148 --> 01:05:52.823
insolvent.
It was doing it through an SIV

01:05:52.823 --> 01:06:01.679
on it's--called the Rhineland
Investment Vehicle.

01:06:01.679 --> 01:06:05.599
So these--it's not just the
U.S.--this thing is a heavily

01:06:05.599 --> 01:06:09.521
international problem.
So, this was a German bank

01:06:09.521 --> 01:06:14.608
doing exactly the same thing and
it became insolvent and the

01:06:14.608 --> 01:06:18.659
German Government had to come to
its rescue.

01:06:18.659 --> 01:06:21.971
It turns out that 38% of this
bank was owned by the German

01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:24.469
Government, so it was kind of
their problem,

01:06:24.469 --> 01:06:26.823
right?
They weren't watching what was

01:06:26.823 --> 01:06:29.659
going on adequately and so there
was a bailout.

01:06:29.659 --> 01:06:37.010
The bailout--I don't have the
exact number here--it was a huge

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:41.284
number of Euros.
It kind of was a wake up call

01:06:41.284 --> 01:06:45.274
in Germany because they were
watching with amusement the

01:06:45.274 --> 01:06:49.555
subprime crisis in the United
States and here it was causing

01:06:49.555 --> 01:06:53.768
losses to the German Government.
I think it was in tens of

01:06:53.768 --> 01:06:55.750
billions of Euros;
it was huge.

01:06:55.750 --> 01:07:01.986
This wasn't the only one.
There was another German bank

01:07:01.986 --> 01:07:10.050
called Sachsen LB,
which failed at the same time.

01:07:10.050 --> 01:07:13.037
I guess the two together--I
think it was twenty-six billion

01:07:13.037 --> 01:07:17.438
Euros.
Sachsen LB and IKB was a

01:07:17.438 --> 01:07:27.409
bailout of twenty-six billion
Euros and that's a huge scandal

01:07:27.409 --> 01:07:31.310
in Europe,
which is still unfolding,

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:34.429
and it derives from the U.S.
subprime crisis.

01:07:34.429 --> 01:07:37.408
What was happening was,
these banks were not being

01:07:37.408 --> 01:07:41.742
watched carefully enough;
their capital requirements were

01:07:41.742 --> 01:07:46.519
not enough for the kind of
assets they were investing.

01:07:46.519 --> 01:07:49.650
Now, part of the problem is
that the rating agencies were

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:52.893
rating their securities that
they were investing in as AAA,

01:07:52.893 --> 01:07:55.760
in many cases.
There was a big goof up.

01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:59.570
The rating agencies weren't
cutting the ratings as they

01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:03.522
should and these European banks
were just kind of naively

01:08:03.522 --> 01:08:06.910
trusting and it just didn't get
figured out.

01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:13.316
Now, it hit France too;
BNP Paribas is a major French

01:08:13.316 --> 01:08:20.569
bank and it had a couple of,
well, several funds.

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:27.056
PowerVest, Dynamic,
BNP Paribas-ABS Euribor and BNP

01:08:27.056 --> 01:08:34.451
Paribas-ABS Eonia and these
things collapsed and I believe

01:08:34.451 --> 01:08:42.105
the three funds lost--I have
down two trillion Euros--I have

01:08:42.105 --> 01:08:46.189
to check that,
that sounds high.

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:51.134
But it wasn't--the point was,
it was the same scandal that we

01:08:51.134 --> 01:08:55.090
saw in the U.S.,
U.K., Germany and now France;

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:57.319
it was the same source.
It was the U.S.

01:08:57.319 --> 01:09:01.973
housing crisis that was causing
a contagion around the world

01:09:01.973 --> 01:09:05.996
from one country to another
because the banks in the

01:09:05.996 --> 01:09:10.728
countries had invested in risky
securities--they hadn't taken

01:09:10.728 --> 01:09:14.909
proper account of the risk and
they didn't have enough

01:09:14.909 --> 01:09:18.360
reserves.
The same thing affected U.S.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:24.632
banks as well.
It was Bear Sterns,

01:09:24.632 --> 01:09:31.178
whose headquarters is right
next to Grand Central Station,

01:09:31.178 --> 01:09:38.989
if you go into New York.
They had a couple of funds;

01:09:38.989 --> 01:09:44.659
one was called High-Grade--I
like to write this

01:09:44.659 --> 01:09:51.809
down--High-Grade Structured
Credit and another one that was

01:09:51.809 --> 01:09:58.846
called Enhanced Leverage Fund.
These names sound safe--High

01:09:58.846 --> 01:10:04.946
Grade, Enhanced--but they both
collapsed and became leveraged

01:10:04.946 --> 01:10:09.094
fund.
They became almost worthless

01:10:09.094 --> 01:10:16.238
because they were investing in
subprime debt and the value of

01:10:16.238 --> 01:10:22.550
the debt collapsed and so these
collapsed as well.

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:25.977
These are just some examples.
I think we're in a very

01:10:25.977 --> 01:10:30.109
interesting time for banking and
for the economy as a whole.

01:10:30.109 --> 01:10:35.066
What we've seen is a testing of
the system--that we have

01:10:35.066 --> 01:10:39.132
regulatory requirements,
that banks have enough

01:10:39.132 --> 01:10:43.907
capital--but this regulation is
challenging because it's being

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:47.326
stressed right now.
A lot of people get complacent

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:50.718
during normal times and they
assume that normal times will go

01:10:50.718 --> 01:10:53.062
on forever.
They can't imagine--they don't

01:10:53.062 --> 01:10:56.324
have the power of imagination to
think what the next crisis will

01:10:56.324 --> 01:10:58.550
be like, so it catches them by
surprise.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:03.054
We'll figure this all out.
Banks, as I say,

01:11:03.054 --> 01:11:07.265
are with us to stay;
we just have to improve our

01:11:07.265 --> 01:11:10.698
regulation and disclosure
requirements so that banks can

01:11:10.698 --> 01:11:13.569
be prevented from taking
unnecessary risks.

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:17.733
I hope you will all come to
hear Redleaf on Wednesday and I

01:11:17.733 --> 01:11:21.180
look forward to having lunch
with some of you.

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:26.687
I don't think I can get either
Icahn--both Icahn and Schwarzman

01:11:26.687 --> 01:11:30.239
are coming to give a lecture in
April,

01:11:30.239 --> 01:11:33.021
but I don't think either of
them will stay for lunch,

01:11:33.021 --> 01:11:35.000
so this is our only luncheon
event.

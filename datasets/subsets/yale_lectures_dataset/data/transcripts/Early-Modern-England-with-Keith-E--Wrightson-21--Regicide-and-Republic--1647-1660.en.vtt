00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.527
Prof: So,
we're in 1646 and,

00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:08.713
as I explained last time,
the development of the war,

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:11.840
especially between 1643 and
'45,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.210
had unleashed forces which
could not easily be controlled

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.801
and created aims and
expectations which had not

00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:23.470
originally existed at the
outbreak of war,

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.800
especially the controversy
concerning the future

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.775
organization of the church and
the issue of 'liberty of

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:34.250
conscience'.
 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.684
Parliament was now severely
divided between those who wanted

00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:43.344
a Presbyterian church settlement
and the so-called Independents

00:00:43.344 --> 00:00:46.200
who favored liberty of
conscience.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.729
With the defeat of the King
these issues were now prominent

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.010
in establishing the terms of
settlement.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.250
And, as they attempted a
settlement,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.561
the fundamental differences of
perception of the nature of the

00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:02.375
parliamentary cause--
what it had been,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:06.519
what it was now--came very much
to the fore.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:09.757
In 1646 to '7,
the so-called Presbyterian

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:13.480
group were the dominant group in
parliament.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.769
They held the initiative and in
July 1646 they put to King

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.424
Charles--
who was now in the north of

00:01:21.424 --> 00:01:23.909
England held by the Scots in
Newcastle--

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.220
they put to him the Newcastle
Propositions.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.840
Under those terms the King
should take the Covenant;

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.072
there should be a united
Presbyterian church of both

00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:38.257
England and Scotland;
parliament was to control the

00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:41.593
military for twenty years,
which they thought was roughly

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:45.688
the King's expected lifetime);
and fifty-eight of the King's

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:50.165
supporters were to be exempted
from pardon on the grounds that

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:54.349
they had committed various
atrocities in the course of the

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:55.010
war.
 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.330
Charles, faced with these
terms, played for time.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.453
He might have lost militarily,
but he knew that they still

00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:05.769
needed him for any settlement.
 

00:02:05.769 --> 00:02:09.558
Remember what the Earl of
Manchester had said back in

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:13.421
1644: "if we beat the King
ninety and nine times,

00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:15.389
he is king still."
 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.538
Charles knew that.
 

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:22.333
In February 1647,
the Scots' army was paid off by

00:02:22.333 --> 00:02:24.310
the English parliament.
 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.621
They handed over the King into
English custody and they

00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:30.735
withdrew back to Scotland,
and the King was brought south

00:02:30.735 --> 00:02:33.050
and lodged in a country house in
Northamptonshire,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.008
northwest of London,
Holmby House,

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:38.788
where negotiations continued.
 

00:02:38.788 --> 00:02:42.771
Meanwhile, the New Model
Army--which was now for the most

00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:46.400
part billeted in eastern England
near Cambridge--

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.121
the New Model Army was ordered
either to disband or to reenlist

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:57.842
for service in Ireland where the
Irish confederacy was still in

00:02:57.842 --> 00:02:58.949
control.
 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:03.525
This demand provoked an army,
many of whom were already

00:03:03.525 --> 00:03:08.014
worried by the prospect of a
settlement which would be

00:03:08.014 --> 00:03:11.318
intolerant in matters of
religion,

00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:16.288
and the consequences of that
provocation were momentous.

00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:20.708
In April and May 1647,
the cavalry regiments of the

00:03:20.708 --> 00:03:23.889
New Model elected
representatives.

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.430
They were called
"Agitators."

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.370
They elected Agitators.
 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.162
And a Council of the Army was
formed which consisted of the

00:03:32.162 --> 00:03:36.258
general officers,
the colonels of the regiments,

00:03:36.258 --> 00:03:40.910
and the representatives of the
various regiments.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.679
Then on the 4^(th) of June a
junior officer,

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.536
Cornet Joyce,
went to Holmby House and seized

00:03:48.536 --> 00:03:52.128
the King and brought him to the
army.

00:03:52.128 --> 00:03:54.977
There's a famous story that
when Joyce arrived at Holmby

00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:58.187
House the guard there asked him
where his warrant was to remove

00:03:58.187 --> 00:04:00.569
the King and he drew his pistol
and said,

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.710
"here is my warrant."
 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.463
Then on the 14th of June the
army issued and printed a

00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:09.718
Declaration.
 

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:13.587
They declared themselves to be
"no mere mercenary

00:04:13.587 --> 00:04:18.185
army," but an army enlisted
to defend "our own and the

00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:21.470
people's just rights and
liberties."

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.196
They demanded an Act of
Oblivion to wipe away all acts

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:29.345
which had been committed during
the war, pardon for all acts

00:04:29.345 --> 00:04:32.095
committed;
they demanded liberty for

00:04:32.095 --> 00:04:35.343
"tender consciences,"
as they put it,

00:04:35.343 --> 00:04:37.180
in matters of religion.
 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.911
And the army leaders,
with the council,

00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:43.937
began drawing up their own
terms for negotiation with the

00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:45.949
King whom they now held.
 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.144
Then, in late July 1647,
demonstrations in London on

00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:55.079
behalf of Presbyterianism and
against the army's actions,

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:59.449
led to the Independent members
of parliament fleeing the city.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.120
They fled to the army and asked
for its protection.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.810
On the 6th of August the army
marched south and occupied

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.500
London, restoring them to
parliament, from which some of

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.569
their Presbyterian enemies fled.
 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.769
Now then it was the turn of the
army and the Independents in

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:23.470
parliament to attempt a
settlement with the King,

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:28.315
and they put to him terms which
were entitled the Heads of the

00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:29.269
Proposals.
 

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:31.670
They were drawn up by Henry
Ireton,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.728
a former lawyer who was the
Commissary General of the New

00:05:34.728 --> 00:05:36.449
Model,
and John Lambert,

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.350
one of the cavalry colonels,
and they were probably the most

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.464
generous terms--
well they were certainly the

00:05:42.464 --> 00:05:45.649
most generous terms--
ever offered to King Charles;

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:48.910
remarkably so in fact.
 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.675
The army insisted that in
future there would be a

00:05:51.675 --> 00:05:54.959
parliament elected every two
years and that control of the

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:57.149
militia would be with
parliament,

00:05:57.149 --> 00:06:00.139
but only for ten years,
not twenty.

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.300
They exempted only five
Royalists from pardon.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.233
They were even willing to
permit the reestablishment of a

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:12.310
Church of England with bishops
and the old prayer book,

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.699
but it should have no coercive
powers over those who preferred

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.367
other forms of worship:
so a reestablished Church of

00:06:20.367 --> 00:06:24.110
England but with liberty for
tender consciences.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.711
Charles' aide in the
negotiations,

00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:30.495
Sir John Berkeley,
urged the King to accept these

00:06:30.495 --> 00:06:31.600
proposals.
 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.966
He said never would a kingdom
lost be so easily recovered as

00:06:35.966 --> 00:06:39.000
on such terms,
but the King temporized.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.185
Berkeley later recorded in his
memoirs that in his view the

00:06:43.185 --> 00:06:47.730
King would not agree because he
didn't trust Cromwell and Ireton

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.916
and the reason he didn't trust
them was that they asked for

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:54.009
nothing for themselves.
 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.930
But most likely the King was
simply playing for time and

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.389
secretly opening negotiations at
this time with the Scots,

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.913
who were increasingly alarmed,
now that they'd withdrawn from

00:07:07.913 --> 00:07:10.920
England,
at what was happening in

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.230
England and at the prospect of
Independents in power.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.101
Meanwhile, while this was going
on a further set of proposals

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:23.714
began gestating amongst the
Agitators in the army council

00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:26.798
and some of the officers,
and these were deeply

00:07:26.798 --> 00:07:29.920
influenced by the views of the
London radical movement,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.610
the Levellers.
 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.110
The Levellers,
led by John Lilburne,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.644
William Walwyn,
Richard Overton,

00:07:38.644 --> 00:07:42.466
and John Wildman,
had emerged initially as

00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:46.930
pamphleteers on behalf of
liberty of conscience.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.158
But their experience at the
hands of an intolerant

00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:53.452
Presbyterian-dominated
parliament led them to begin

00:07:53.452 --> 00:07:57.274
questioning the whole basis of
government authority and the

00:07:57.274 --> 00:08:01.161
manner in which the hands of
power might be tied in a number

00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:02.480
of respects.
 

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.975
They claimed in their pamphlets
to speak on behalf of what they

00:08:05.975 --> 00:08:09.076
called "the middle and
poorer sort of people,"

00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:11.540
"the hobnails,
the clouted shoes,

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.059
the private soldiers,
the leather and woolen aprons

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:18.389
and all the laborious and
industrious people of

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:19.620
England."
 

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.709
A very distinctly populist
stance.

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:26.139
And they advanced the
claim--I'm quoting--

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:30.218
"that all power is
originally and essentially in

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:34.061
the whole body of the people of
this nation":

00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:37.120
declaration of popular
sovereignty.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.325
Accordingly,
they put forward proposals

00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:42.575
including a single-chamber
parliament--they would abolish

00:08:42.575 --> 00:08:45.145
the House of Lords;
a redistribution of

00:08:45.145 --> 00:08:48.918
parliamentary seats in order to
make them more equitable;

00:08:48.918 --> 00:08:53.364
elections to be held every two
years with a much wider male

00:08:53.364 --> 00:08:56.428
suffrage--quite how wide is
debatable.

00:08:56.428 --> 00:08:59.177
They probably held a variety of
different views at different

00:08:59.177 --> 00:08:59.548
times.
 

00:08:59.548 --> 00:09:02.428
Some appear to have been for
full manhood suffrage,

00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:04.139
others for a more limited
suffrage,

00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:11.880
but certainly a larger
one--thorough reform of the

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.724
legal system,
the laws to be simplified and

00:09:16.724 --> 00:09:18.798
to be printed in English.
 

00:09:18.798 --> 00:09:23.226
Well, in October 1647,
much of this was drawn up in a

00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:27.908
set of proposals called the
Agreement of the People,

00:09:27.908 --> 00:09:33.267
and the Agreement of the People
having been debated amongst them

00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:38.625
and printed was then put forward
to the army council in a set of

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:43.557
debates which took place in
Putney Church and they're known

00:09:43.557 --> 00:09:45.940
as the Putney Debates.
 

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.279
We have the full transcript of
the Putney Debates and it's a

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:52.340
quite remarkable survival.
 

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.953
The secretary of the army
council took the whole thing

00:09:55.953 --> 00:09:59.635
down in shorthand and this was
rediscovered in the late

00:09:59.635 --> 00:10:03.658
nineteenth century and is now
fully available in print.

00:10:03.658 --> 00:10:08.025
In the Putney Debates we find
fully transcribed the statements

00:10:08.025 --> 00:10:11.962
not only of the leaders of the
army council but also the

00:10:11.962 --> 00:10:15.971
independent interjections
expressing their aspirations of

00:10:15.971 --> 00:10:19.980
nameless soldiers who had been
elected on behalf of their

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.269
regiments.
 

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:23.678
The secretary of the army
council didn't know their names.

00:10:23.678 --> 00:10:26.450
He put them down as "Buff
Coat," i.e.,

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.796
a man wearing the thick
buff-colored leather coat of a

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:31.474
cavalryman,
or in one case

00:10:31.474 --> 00:10:34.368
"Bedfordshire Man,"
a man who either had a

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:37.836
Bedfordshire accent,
perhaps, or perhaps was wearing

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:40.490
the sash of the Bedfordshire
regiment.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.059
Some of the statements made are
most extraordinary ringing

00:10:44.059 --> 00:10:45.000
declarations.
 

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.136
General Ireton,
who did most of the talking on

00:10:48.136 --> 00:10:52.644
behalf of the officers,
thought that all men should

00:10:52.644 --> 00:10:56.886
enjoy liberty under the law,
but he took the view

00:10:56.886 --> 00:11:00.630
conventional for a man of his
class that the vote should only

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.717
belong to people of property,
those with "a permanent

00:11:04.717 --> 00:11:07.690
and fixed interest in the
kingdom."

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:10.889
In contrast to that view,
Thomas Rainborough,

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:14.831
an artillery officer,
replied, "the poorest he

00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:19.639
that is in England hath a life
to live as the greatest he,

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:23.057
and therefore,
Sir, I truly think that every

00:11:23.057 --> 00:11:27.509
man that is to live under a
government ought first by his

00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:32.200
own consent to put himself under
that government."

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.336
Ireton appealed to the
importance of constitutional

00:11:35.336 --> 00:11:38.408
tradition in going forward with
the settlement.

00:11:38.408 --> 00:11:43.046
Trooper Sexby urged considering
"the reasonableness of the

00:11:43.046 --> 00:11:46.860
thing" rather than
constitutional precedent.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.871
Well, the Putney Debates are
well worth reading and they

00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:54.884
provide an astonishing insight
into the ideas which were

00:11:54.884 --> 00:11:57.730
circulating in London and the
army;

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.080
ideas generated by the
experience of the war,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.748
by the sense of possibility
which had been unleashed among

00:12:05.748 --> 00:12:08.860
people who had been brought to
ask,

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.389
as several did ask in the
Putney Debates,

00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:14.269
"what hath the soldier
fought for?"

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:18.351
That's a phrase that repeatedly
comes to the fore in the course

00:12:18.351 --> 00:12:21.182
of the debates,
and they tell us a lot about

00:12:21.182 --> 00:12:22.830
the army leaders too.
 

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.546
The Lord General,
Thomas Fairfax,

00:12:25.546 --> 00:12:27.330
was largely silent.
 

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:31.009
Fairfax was a professional
soldier, not a politician.

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:33.789
He was famously taciturn and he
said little.

00:12:33.789 --> 00:12:35.750
He merely acted as chairman.
 

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.899
Henry Ireton did most of the
debating.

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:42.452
He was clear-headed,
very highly intelligent,

00:12:42.452 --> 00:12:43.100
sharp.
 

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.421
He clearly became exasperated
with what he saw as the utopian

00:12:47.421 --> 00:12:50.590
schemes being put forward by the
soldiers.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.142
At one point he replied to the
question, "what hath the

00:12:53.142 --> 00:12:54.308
soldier fought for?"
 

00:12:54.308 --> 00:12:56.240
by saying, "I tell you
what the soldier...

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.590
has fought for...
 

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.820
that one man's will shall not
be law."

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.308
That was Ireton's perception of
the conflict,

00:13:04.308 --> 00:13:08.669
but he also declared himself
willing to follow where God

00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:09.860
might lead.
 

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:13.240
Cromwell was something of a
mediating figure.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.178
He said comparatively little.
 

00:13:15.178 --> 00:13:17.240
It was characteristic of his
manner.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.738
He tended often when major
decisions were to be made to

00:13:22.738 --> 00:13:27.018
hesitate,
to wait, to wait on a sign from

00:13:27.018 --> 00:13:30.202
God,
and then when he was sure of

00:13:30.202 --> 00:13:34.740
his course of his action to take
drastic action.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.558
Well, were the general officers
seriously negotiating with the

00:13:38.558 --> 00:13:42.441
representatives of the regiments
or were they just humoring the

00:13:42.441 --> 00:13:45.884
troops to maintain order and
coherence in the army while

00:13:45.884 --> 00:13:49.830
pressing ahead with their own
negotiations with the King?

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:54.200
We'll never really know because
ultimately it came to nothing.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.455
The debates broke up
inconclusively,

00:13:56.455 --> 00:14:00.255
and the reason they broke up
was because of an action on the

00:14:00.255 --> 00:14:01.610
part of the King.
 

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:07.192
Charles was very much aware of
the possibilities of exploiting

00:14:07.192 --> 00:14:11.769
potential divisions on the
Parliamentarian side.

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:16.219
He was also very fearful of the
radicals and what might happen

00:14:16.219 --> 00:14:20.450
if they were to gain the
ascendancy in the army council.

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.888
On the 11^(th) of November he
escaped from custody,

00:14:23.888 --> 00:14:28.014
went south and took refuge on
the Isle of Wight off the south

00:14:28.014 --> 00:14:29.460
coast of England.
 

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.466
There he was held by the
Parliamentarian governor in

00:14:33.466 --> 00:14:37.080
honorable custody but he was
allowed to receive

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.571
representatives,
and they included

00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:43.928
representatives from Scotland.
 

00:14:43.928 --> 00:14:48.015
On the 15^(th) of November,
faced with this situation,

00:14:48.015 --> 00:14:52.255
Fairfax and Cromwell called the
army to a rendezvous and

00:14:52.255 --> 00:14:54.570
discipline was re-imposed.
 

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.009
Cromwell rode up and down the
ranks,

00:14:57.009 --> 00:14:59.650
plucking copies of the
Agreement of the People from the

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.634
hatbands of some of the soldiers
who'd come with copies of the

00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:04.690
Agreement of the People in their
hats.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:11.440
One intransigent soldier was
summarily court-martialed and

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:12.269
shot.
 

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:16.065
In December 1647,
the King, meanwhile,

00:15:16.065 --> 00:15:21.399
concluded an agreement with
Scots representatives.

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:23.899
It was called the Engagement.
 

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:28.902
In the Engagement he undertook
to accept a Presbyterian church

00:15:28.902 --> 00:15:33.166
in return for military aid and
he also began secretly

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:37.605
negotiation--
negotiating with the Irish

00:15:37.605 --> 00:15:39.129
confederacy.
 

00:15:39.129 --> 00:15:43.245
Shortly afterwards in the
spring of 1648 there were

00:15:43.245 --> 00:15:48.187
concerted Royalist uprisings in
various parts of the kingdom:

00:15:48.187 --> 00:15:51.008
in Wales,
in South Wales,

00:15:51.008 --> 00:15:56.570
in Kent, in Essex,
and in the north in Yorkshire.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.970
Meanwhile, Charles' supporters
in Scotland,

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:04.683
the Engagers,
began assembling an army for

00:16:04.683 --> 00:16:11.125
the invasion of England to
deliver the King and with that

00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:14.690
the second civil war began.
 

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.778
So, after so much hope of a
settlement,

00:16:18.778 --> 00:16:22.445
so much generosity in the terms
which had been offered to

00:16:22.445 --> 00:16:25.129
Charles in the Heads of the
Proposals,

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:29.339
this renewal of the war
hardened the hearts of the

00:16:29.339 --> 00:16:30.798
army's leaders.
 

00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:33.802
On the 29th of April,
1648, they called the whole

00:16:33.802 --> 00:16:37.431
army to a general assembly at
Windsor to the west of London

00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:41.558
for a prayer meeting before they
divided into various bodies,

00:16:41.558 --> 00:16:45.419
each of which was to take on
the Royalist threat in different

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:46.899
areas of the kingdom.
 

00:16:46.899 --> 00:16:50.988
And the mood at Windsor was
very different from that at

00:16:50.988 --> 00:16:51.668
Putney.
 

00:16:51.668 --> 00:16:56.004
The mood was one of heightened
religious anxiety,

00:16:56.004 --> 00:17:00.971
anger, and expectation amongst
men who had not wanted or

00:17:00.971 --> 00:17:03.500
expected to fight again.
 

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:08.811
They saw the renewal of the war
as being both a judgment from

00:17:08.811 --> 00:17:14.390
God upon their previous actions
and a test of their resolve,

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.076
and they resolved that Charles
was "a man against whom God

00:17:19.076 --> 00:17:22.309
hath witnessed"--
I'm quoting from the

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:25.009
declaration which ended the
meeting--

00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:29.631
and therefore "that it was
our duty if ever the Lord

00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:33.838
brought us back to peace to call
Charles Stuart,

00:17:33.838 --> 00:17:38.026
that man of blood,
to an account for that blood he

00:17:38.026 --> 00:17:43.153
hath shed and the mischief he
hath done to his utmost against

00:17:43.153 --> 00:17:48.279
the Lord's cause and people in
these poor nations."

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:51.470
And in that mood the army
departed,

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.375
Fairfax to the east,
Cromwell first to Wales and

00:17:55.375 --> 00:18:00.443
then to the north where on the
17th to the 19th of July he met

00:18:00.443 --> 00:18:05.430
and utterly shattered a much
larger Scottish-Royalist army at

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:10.556
the Battle of Preston,
a hard-fought running battle

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:15.891
which stretched for miles along
the road from Preston to

00:18:15.891 --> 00:18:17.250
Manchester.
 

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.220
Cromwell saw that victory as
divinely ordained.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.799
In the dispatch he sent back he
could see "nothing but the

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:28.108
hand of God"
in it, as he put it.

00:18:28.108 --> 00:18:32.720
God had spoken again as far as
he was concerned and the army

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.939
began returning slowly to London
in a mood of religious

00:18:36.939 --> 00:18:40.111
exultation,
pausing in Yorkshire to mop up

00:18:40.111 --> 00:18:43.057
Royalist resistance at
Pontefract Castle before

00:18:43.057 --> 00:18:44.338
proceeding south.
 

00:18:44.338 --> 00:18:49.828
At the brief siege of
Pontefract, Thomas Rainborough,

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:52.680
the Leveller,
was killed.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.318
But meanwhile parliament had
reopened negotiations with the

00:18:58.318 --> 00:18:59.000
King.
 

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.380
The King was king still.
 

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:05.960
This proved too much for the
officers in London.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.079
On the 6th of December,
1648, Colonel Thomas Pride

00:19:09.079 --> 00:19:12.836
stationed troops at the entrance
to the House of Commons and

00:19:12.836 --> 00:19:15.640
conducted what's known as
Pride's Purge.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.048
He refused to allow into
parliament anyone who did not

00:19:19.048 --> 00:19:21.298
sympathize with the army's
cause.

00:19:21.298 --> 00:19:27.308
Parliament was reduced to only
150 members known as the Rump.

00:19:27.308 --> 00:19:31.241
While this was going on
Cromwell was mysteriously

00:19:31.241 --> 00:19:31.980
absent.
 

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:36.480
He returned to London only
after Pride's Purge had been

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.480
completed.
 

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.358
Exactly where he was isn't
certain.

00:19:39.358 --> 00:19:42.440
It's possible that he'd gone
home to Huntingdonshire.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.558
That's one idea.
 

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:48.056
He seems to have been
undergoing one of those periods

00:19:48.056 --> 00:19:52.290
of reflection before deciding on
decisive action which were very

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:56.951
characteristic of him;
but once he came back he was

00:19:56.951 --> 00:20:00.588
prominent in driving things
ahead.

00:20:00.588 --> 00:20:04.830
On the 1^(st) of January 1649,
the Rump, the remaining 150

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:08.701
members of parliament,
set up a high court of justice

00:20:08.701 --> 00:20:10.190
to try the King.
 

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:13.278
The House of Lords refused to
participate.

00:20:13.278 --> 00:20:17.221
The House of Commons therefore
declared that its own decisions

00:20:17.221 --> 00:20:20.970
would have the force of law
since "the people are,

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:26.568
under God, the original of all
just power."

00:20:26.568 --> 00:20:29.900
On the 20th of January,
Charles I was arraigned.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:33.220
The charge--I'm
quoting--declaring him to be

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.557
"a tyrant,
a traitor, a murderer,

00:20:36.557 --> 00:20:41.424
and a public and implacable
enemy to the Commonwealth of

00:20:41.424 --> 00:20:42.930
England."
 

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.023
The King with great dignity
attended his trial in

00:20:47.023 --> 00:20:52.227
Westminster Hall but refused to
recognize the authority of the

00:20:52.227 --> 00:20:53.079
court.
 

00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:55.230
He was condemned.
 

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:59.419
On the 29th of January,
only fifty-nine of the more

00:20:59.419 --> 00:21:04.027
than 150 members of the court
could be prevailed upon to

00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:07.630
actually sign the King's death
warrant.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.740
And then the following day the
King was executed on a scaffold

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.930
outside his banqueting hall in
Whitehall Palace.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.246
It's still there today,
the Banqueting Hall,

00:21:19.246 --> 00:21:21.940
the only surviving building of
Whitehall Palace.

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.554
If you visit it,
the room that you enter on the

00:21:26.554 --> 00:21:31.670
first floor is the former
banqueting hall itself.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:36.284
The ceiling is decorated with a
wonderful painting by Rubens of

00:21:36.284 --> 00:21:38.740
the apotheosis of King James I.
 

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.670
Charles' father is shown
ascending into heaven.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:47.460
It's a wonderful artistic
statement of divine right

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.270
monarchy,
and ironically it was under

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.532
that painting that Charles
walked to step out from the

00:21:53.532 --> 00:21:57.692
window on to the scaffold,
wearing two shirts because it

00:21:57.692 --> 00:22:02.237
was a cold January day in case
he should shiver and people

00:22:02.237 --> 00:22:04.548
might think he was afraid.
 

00:22:04.548 --> 00:22:08.577
He met his death with great
dignity, perhaps knowing that

00:22:08.577 --> 00:22:12.318
this was the best thing he could
do for the monarchy,

00:22:12.318 --> 00:22:14.548
to die well,
and so he did.

00:22:14.548 --> 00:22:19.875
And as his head was struck off
one witness says that from the

00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:24.401
crowd there came "such a
groan as I never heard

00:22:24.401 --> 00:22:25.910
before."
 

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.376
It's ironic for those of us who
live in New Haven that in

00:22:29.376 --> 00:22:32.471
Broadway we have a high
Anglo-Catholic Episcopalian

00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:36.186
church which is one of those
that recognizes the execution of

00:22:36.186 --> 00:22:40.250
King Charles I,
commemorates it as a martyrdom

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.063
for the Episcopal church,
and we have running from

00:22:44.063 --> 00:22:47.176
Broadway three streets named
after three of the men who

00:22:47.176 --> 00:22:53.650
signed his death warrant,
Goffe, Whalley, and Dixwell.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.339
So the fingerprints of these
events are here.

00:22:57.339 --> 00:23:00.250
What next?
 

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.657
They had tried and they had
failed to reach a settlement

00:23:03.657 --> 00:23:04.650
with the King.
 

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.890
Could they achieve one without
him?

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.690
Well, it was attempted.
 

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.960
In March 1649,
parliament declared the

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.848
monarchy and the House of Lords
abolished.

00:23:17.848 --> 00:23:21.055
In May 1649,
England was declared "a

00:23:21.055 --> 00:23:23.940
Commonwealth and Free
State."

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:28.005
All writs were to run in the
name not of the King but of the

00:23:28.005 --> 00:23:31.450
"keepers of the liberties
of England."

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:36.428
A new great seal was made for
the kingdom which bore a picture

00:23:36.428 --> 00:23:41.651
not of the King but of the House
of Commons in session surrounded

00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:46.304
around the edge with the legend
"In the first year of

00:23:46.304 --> 00:23:50.140
freedom by God's blessing
restored."

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:54.355
Well, perhaps in time those
lofty aspirations might have

00:23:54.355 --> 00:23:59.262
acquired some real substance,
but for the moment the fact was

00:23:59.262 --> 00:24:04.169
that this was a regime run by a
committed minority supported by

00:24:04.169 --> 00:24:08.601
a somewhat larger body who were
willing to conform to its

00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:13.429
authority out of pragmatism or
for the sake of order or out of

00:24:13.429 --> 00:24:16.118
mere political opportunism.
 

00:24:16.118 --> 00:24:19.990
But despite its lofty claims
the survival of the regime

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:24.218
depended ultimately upon the
army and the army of course had

00:24:24.218 --> 00:24:26.009
an agenda of its own.
 

00:24:26.009 --> 00:24:32.692
Above all, defense of liberty
of conscience for the godly and

00:24:32.692 --> 00:24:39.487
the pursuit of a rather vaguely
defined 'godly reformation' in

00:24:39.487 --> 00:24:41.269
the kingdom.
 

00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:46.032
These tensions were initially
disguised by the fact that there

00:24:46.032 --> 00:24:49.858
was an immediate need to defend
the new regime.

00:24:49.858 --> 00:24:53.662
In 1649 to '50,
parliament undertook the

00:24:53.662 --> 00:24:58.828
re-conquest of Ireland to
prevent its use as a base by

00:24:58.828 --> 00:25:02.652
Charles II,
now aged nineteen and in

00:25:02.652 --> 00:25:08.403
exile--and that re-conquest was
brutally initiated by Cromwell

00:25:08.403 --> 00:25:09.440
himself.
 

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.381
Cromwell was now appointed lord
general since Sir Thomas

00:25:12.381 --> 00:25:14.407
Fairfax,
after the execution of the

00:25:14.407 --> 00:25:18.603
King, in which he had no part,
was not willing to go any

00:25:18.603 --> 00:25:20.640
further and retired.
 

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.931
Cromwell blundered in to
Ireland with very little

00:25:24.931 --> 00:25:28.953
understanding of the
complexities of the Irish

00:25:28.953 --> 00:25:34.049
situation and blinded by the
1641 propaganda stereotype of

00:25:34.049 --> 00:25:38.700
the barbarities committed by the
Irish rebels.

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:43.153
At the fortress town of
Drogheda near Dublin in 1649,

00:25:43.153 --> 00:25:47.950
a massacre of the defenders of
Drogheda was committed.

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.009
This was justified by the laws
of war.

00:25:51.009 --> 00:25:53.440
They had refused to surrender
honorably and,

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.130
under the laws of war at the
time, a city taken by assault,

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.759
with the losses that that
involved,

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:03.670
would be one which would be
permitted no quarter.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.998
Nevertheless,
it was an act probably partly

00:26:06.998 --> 00:26:10.088
fueled by religious bigotry and
zeal.

00:26:10.088 --> 00:26:14.155
Cromwell himself in the
dispatch he sent back to England

00:26:14.155 --> 00:26:18.369
after Drogheda appears troubled
by what he had ordered.

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:21.710
It has a very defensive tone.
 

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.492
Nonetheless,
it was done and it initiated a

00:26:24.492 --> 00:26:28.403
bloody pacification of Ireland
which continued for two years

00:26:28.403 --> 00:26:32.380
and culminated in confiscations
of land from Irish landowners

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:36.490
and the founding of a Protestant
ascendancy in Ireland with the

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.338
land being granted to
adventurers,

00:26:39.338 --> 00:26:41.549
who had given money for the
re-conquest,

00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:43.210
and soldiers.
 

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.410
It didn't create the Protestant
Ireland they envisaged.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:51.450
It created a deeply divided
society dominated by British

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:56.673
landowners and the roots of the
subsequent animosity which

00:26:56.673 --> 00:27:00.890
remains even in the current
fragile peace.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:07.568
Meanwhile, in 1650 Charles II
landed in Scotland where he was

00:27:07.568 --> 00:27:09.240
crowned king.
 

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.338
Cromwell moved north to
campaign there against Charles.

00:27:13.338 --> 00:27:17.231
On the 3rd of September 1650,
he took on the army of the

00:27:17.231 --> 00:27:19.710
Covenant at the Battle of
Dunbar.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.617
Heavily outnumbered,
his troops hungry and many of

00:27:22.617 --> 00:27:25.859
them sick,
and nevertheless by a brilliant

00:27:25.859 --> 00:27:30.163
tactic of attacking the center
of the Scottish line and

00:27:30.163 --> 00:27:33.910
splitting it they won an
unexpected victory.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.578
Again Cromwell exulted.
 

00:27:35.578 --> 00:27:39.251
"The Lord hath done
this," he said in his

00:27:39.251 --> 00:27:40.058
dispatch.
 

00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:44.152
A second Scottish invasion
force was formed in the west and

00:27:44.152 --> 00:27:45.140
moved south.
 

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.529
Cromwell then chased it down
the east,

00:27:47.529 --> 00:27:50.741
moved across and met them at
Worcester a year after Dunbar

00:27:50.741 --> 00:27:52.940
where again on the 3rd of
September,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.960
exactly a year later,
they were completely defeated.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.407
The Battle of Worcester was
described by Cromwell as

00:28:01.407 --> 00:28:03.640
"the crowning mercy."
 

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.430
Charles II, who had been with
that army,

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.711
fled in to exile again,
after the famous incident in

00:28:09.711 --> 00:28:12.931
which he hid in an oak tree at
Boscobel House while

00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:16.536
Parliamentarian soldiers
searched the grounds beneath for

00:28:16.536 --> 00:28:19.605
him;
a story he liked to tell later

00:28:19.605 --> 00:28:22.759
after he'd been restored to the
crown.

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:26.490
By 1653, the Commonwealth of
England,

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:31.710
Scotland, and Ireland created
by these military actions and

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.390
conquest constituted the first
all-British state,

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:42.269
and meanwhile in 1652 to '4 a
victorious naval war was fought

00:28:42.269 --> 00:28:44.230
against the Dutch.
 

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.108
Initially, at the very
foundation of the English

00:28:47.108 --> 00:28:50.784
Commonwealth the idea had been
put forward of forming a union

00:28:50.784 --> 00:28:52.500
with the Dutch republic.
 

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.710
That had been rejected and
subsequent quarrels,

00:28:55.710 --> 00:29:00.252
the Dutch sheltering of
Charles, and trade rivalry led

00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:05.740
to a brief naval war in which
the Commonwealth was victorious.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.354
So, by 1653,
the Commonwealth was militarily

00:29:10.354 --> 00:29:11.750
triumphant.
 

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:15.883
Its forces, now battle hardened
and possessed of the

00:29:15.883 --> 00:29:20.906
extraordinary morale which had
come from victory after victory,

00:29:20.906 --> 00:29:23.420
were apparently invincible.
 

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:29.660
But with the peace,
tensions re-surfaced.

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:34.092
This was not the popular regime
which had been envisaged by the

00:29:34.092 --> 00:29:34.950
Levellers.
 

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.185
It was not the godly regime
which had been envisaged by

00:29:39.185 --> 00:29:40.048
Cromwell.
 

00:29:40.048 --> 00:29:44.180
The Rump had passed a
Toleration Act in 1650 granting

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:48.628
toleration and religious sects
of all kinds proliferated,

00:29:48.628 --> 00:29:49.900
as you know.
 

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.452
Some steps had been taken to
improve the financial position

00:29:53.452 --> 00:29:57.130
of the clergy in the church to
get a better quality of clergy

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.500
and some cosmetic reforms had
been made to the law.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:06.028
But apart from that the Rump
showed little reforming zeal.

00:30:06.028 --> 00:30:09.961
There was also a good deal of
suspicion in the army that the

00:30:09.961 --> 00:30:14.160
members of the Rump planned to
perpetuate themselves forever.

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.685
There was talk that when a seat
fell vacant they would hold what

00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:19.477
were called
"recruiter"

00:30:19.477 --> 00:30:22.499
elections for a single
constituency rather than holding

00:30:22.499 --> 00:30:25.465
a general election for the
election of an entirely new

00:30:25.465 --> 00:30:26.529
parliament.
 

00:30:26.529 --> 00:30:29.920
The army didn't like that.
 

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.808
Finally, on the 20^(th) of
April 1653,

00:30:33.808 --> 00:30:37.287
when it appeared that the Rump
was about to go ahead with that

00:30:37.287 --> 00:30:40.939
scheme Cromwell,
who had been waiting patiently,

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:42.680
precipitously acted.
 

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.165
He stood up in parliament,
called in troops,

00:30:46.165 --> 00:30:50.461
and dissolved the Rump,
famously declaring as he drove

00:30:50.461 --> 00:30:54.029
them out of their chamber,
"Begone.

00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:59.108
You have sat here too long for
all the good you do."

00:30:59.108 --> 00:31:03.109
Well, what followed in the next
five years was a series of

00:31:03.109 --> 00:31:06.480
constitutional experiments in
which Cromwell,

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:12.372
who now held supreme power,
attempted to divest himself of

00:31:12.372 --> 00:31:16.318
that power,
but at the same time retained

00:31:16.318 --> 00:31:21.405
the right to intervene when
necessary to defend what he took

00:31:21.405 --> 00:31:26.272
to be the central cause,
which to him meant above all

00:31:26.272 --> 00:31:31.704
liberty of conscience and rule
by men of "godly and honest

00:31:31.704 --> 00:31:34.858
conversation,"
as he put it.

00:31:34.858 --> 00:31:38.861
The trouble was that too few
others in the nation shared his

00:31:38.861 --> 00:31:41.625
aspirations and,
as he later remarked to

00:31:41.625 --> 00:31:44.893
Bulstrode Whitelocke,
one of his advisers,

00:31:44.893 --> 00:31:49.733
"I am as much for
government by consent as any man

00:31:49.733 --> 00:31:53.680
but where will I find that
consent?"

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.913
His first attempt was to win
consent by establishing a

00:31:57.913 --> 00:32:02.386
reforming government and a
so-called Nominated Parliament

00:32:02.386 --> 00:32:07.098
of 140 members was established
to promote godly reform.

00:32:07.098 --> 00:32:09.630
The members were simply
nominated.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.567
Cromwell described this as
"a door to usher in those

00:32:13.567 --> 00:32:16.240
things that God hath
promised."

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.118
He was quite enthusiastic about
the idea.

00:32:18.118 --> 00:32:20.557
It was the brainchild of one of
his officers,

00:32:20.557 --> 00:32:22.328
Major General Thomas Harrison.
 

00:32:22.328 --> 00:32:25.180
This parliament,
the Nominated Parliament,

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.944
sometimes known as 'Barebone's
Parliament' after one of its

00:32:27.944 --> 00:32:30.915
members,
sat between July and December

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:36.145
1653 and it did indeed begin to
consider radical reforms in the

00:32:36.145 --> 00:32:40.868
law and the abolition of
compulsory tithes in church.

00:32:40.868 --> 00:32:45.825
But even in a parliament of
godly men such steps occasioned

00:32:45.825 --> 00:32:49.500
too much anxiety for most of the
members.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.801
In December 1643,
while some of the more radical

00:32:52.801 --> 00:32:56.737
members were attending a prayer
meeting more conservative

00:32:56.737 --> 00:33:00.672
members of the Nominated
Parliament seized the moment and

00:33:00.672 --> 00:33:05.240
dissolved themselves and handed
the power back to Cromwell.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:10.902
Next, between 1654 and 1657,
they attempted government under

00:33:10.902 --> 00:33:15.990
a constitution called the
Instrument of Government.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:20.424
This was based on the Heads of
the Proposals which had been put

00:33:20.424 --> 00:33:22.000
to the King in 1647.
 

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.470
Cromwell was head of state with
the title of Lord Protector.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.733
Government was to be in the
hands of the Lord Protector

00:33:29.733 --> 00:33:33.259
advised by a council of state,
parliaments were to be elected

00:33:33.259 --> 00:33:36.554
every three years,
and the Lord Protector was

00:33:36.554 --> 00:33:41.890
denied the power to delay any
legislation for more than thirty

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:42.588
days.
 

00:33:42.588 --> 00:33:44.808
This provided a measure of
stability,

00:33:44.808 --> 00:33:49.448
but when the first parliament
met under the Instrument of

00:33:49.448 --> 00:33:53.836
Government in 1654 it
immediately began to attack both

00:33:53.836 --> 00:33:58.723
the Instrument itself and the
religious toleration which was

00:33:58.723 --> 00:34:01.538
so dear to Cromwell's heart.
 

00:34:01.538 --> 00:34:04.982
Consequently,
he dissolved it at the first

00:34:04.982 --> 00:34:06.160
opportunity.
 

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.744
In 1655, the risk of a royalist
uprising and a small attempted

00:34:10.744 --> 00:34:15.480
uprising in the West Country led
to the experiment of appointing

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.539
regional military governors to
govern the country.

00:34:19.539 --> 00:34:23.240
Major Generals were appointed
for a variety of English

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:23.940
regions.
 

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:28.420
They were to oversee government
and to promote godly

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.650
reformation.
 

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:34.001
This measure was bitterly
resented by the county gentry

00:34:34.001 --> 00:34:39.077
and when parliament met again in
1656 they violently attacked it

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:41.980
as "sword government."
 

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:44.889
Cromwell gave way.
 

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:49.704
Then in February 1657
parliament presented him with

00:34:49.704 --> 00:34:54.518
what was called the Humble
Petition and Advice,

00:34:54.518 --> 00:35:02.079
a call upon him to restore the
ancient constitution and to

00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:04.599
accept the crown.
 

00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:10.500
He took three months to think
about it and then in May 1657

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:13.960
rejected the offer of the crown.
 

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.559
He used the phrase "I will
not build Jericho again."

00:35:18.559 --> 00:35:21.159
"I will not build Jericho
again."

00:35:21.159 --> 00:35:23.579
But he accepted all the rest.
 

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:27.878
The Protector with a council
and triennial parliaments was

00:35:27.878 --> 00:35:30.548
continued,
but the ancient constitution

00:35:30.548 --> 00:35:33.989
was largely restored including a
so-called Other House,

00:35:33.989 --> 00:35:40.070
a kind of House of Lords of
nominated members.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:44.463
Well, Cromwell's rejection of
the crown when it was actually

00:35:44.463 --> 00:35:49.079
offered to him is perhaps a test
of his personal integrity,

00:35:49.079 --> 00:35:53.177
but the truth was that as Lord
Protector he was king in all but

00:35:53.177 --> 00:35:53.639
name.
 

00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:58.404
He was probably sincere in
seeing himself as he described

00:35:58.404 --> 00:36:02.998
himself as "a good
constable set to keep the peace

00:36:02.998 --> 00:36:07.336
of the parish,"
and above all to preserve God's

00:36:07.336 --> 00:36:10.400
cause of religious toleration.
 

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.280
Domestically,
his rule was relatively mild.

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.570
Roman Catholics were not
persecuted.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.784
He was much preoccupied with
"healing and

00:36:20.784 --> 00:36:22.000
settling."
 

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.460
He employed many ex-royalists
if they would accept his

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.309
government.
 

00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:29.570
Abroad he was successful.
 

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.779
The Protectorate took part in a
brief war against Spain which

00:36:33.779 --> 00:36:38.128
involved the capture of Jamaica
and also the distinction of the

00:36:38.128 --> 00:36:42.126
New Model Army defeating the
Spanish army at the Battle of

00:36:42.126 --> 00:36:43.110
Dunkirk.
 

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:48.626
But it was not government by
consent and to many of the

00:36:48.626 --> 00:36:53.630
political nation Cromwell
remained an unforgivable

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:54.960
regicide.
 

00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:00.646
To some of those who had been
his former allies he appeared to

00:37:00.646 --> 00:37:03.630
be a hypocritical opportunist.
 

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.679
John Lilburne,
the former Leveller,

00:37:05.679 --> 00:37:08.219
said of Cromwell,
he "will weep,

00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:13.472
howl and call upon the Lord
even while he doth smite thee

00:37:13.472 --> 00:37:16.099
under the first rib."
 

00:37:16.099 --> 00:37:19.500
To still more people in the
country he appeared to be the

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.291
protector not of tender
consciences and English

00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:25.753
liberties but of wild religious
sectaries and fanatics who

00:37:25.753 --> 00:37:29.335
threatened to turn the world
upside down and bring confusion

00:37:29.335 --> 00:37:32.036
in society,
above all the Quakers who in

00:37:32.036 --> 00:37:34.253
their early,
more radical phase,

00:37:34.253 --> 00:37:38.675
caused great alarm as they
spread their message across the

00:37:38.675 --> 00:37:39.530
kingdom.
 

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:43.025
And ultimately everyone knew
that the entire regime still

00:37:43.025 --> 00:37:46.768
depended above all upon the
swords of the New Model Army,

00:37:46.768 --> 00:37:51.679
an army which was increasingly
an army of professionals.

00:37:51.679 --> 00:37:56.932
Only Cromwell himself could
hold it all together by the

00:37:56.932 --> 00:38:02.771
curious blend of pragmatism and
militancy which characterized

00:38:02.771 --> 00:38:08.706
him and by of course the intense
devotion which he inspired in

00:38:08.706 --> 00:38:10.360
his troops.
 

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:15.364
And then on the 3^(rd) of
September 1658,

00:38:15.364 --> 00:38:20.869
aged exactly fifty-nine,
he suddenly died.

00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:24.780
Well, the rest of the story can
be swiftly told.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.030
In 1659, following Cromwell's
death it all collapsed.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.612
He was succeeded as Protector
temporarily by his inadequate

00:38:32.612 --> 00:38:33.539
son, Richard.
 

00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:37.159
Parliament refused to recognize
Richard's authority.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:40.164
In May 1659,
under pressure from the

00:38:40.164 --> 00:38:44.802
generals, Richard resigned,
and the Rump Parliament was

00:38:44.802 --> 00:38:45.920
recalled.
 

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.594
In October 1659,
General John Lambert,

00:38:48.594 --> 00:38:52.356
dissatisfied with its
proceedings, dissolved the Rump

00:38:52.356 --> 00:38:53.079
again.
 

00:38:53.079 --> 00:38:56.670
There was the threat of chaos
in the kingdom.

00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:59.791
In December 1659,
General George Monck,

00:38:59.791 --> 00:39:04.309
commander in chief in Scotland,
decided to intervene.

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:08.349
He marched his troops south to
restore authority.

00:39:08.349 --> 00:39:11.139
That meant first of all,
after he arrived in London,

00:39:11.139 --> 00:39:15.239
restoring the Rump,
and then in February 1660

00:39:15.239 --> 00:39:20.922
readmitting to parliament all
survivors of the Long Parliament

00:39:20.922 --> 00:39:22.039
of 1640.
 

00:39:22.039 --> 00:39:25.934
All of them who were still
alive, all those who had been

00:39:25.934 --> 00:39:30.110
expelled for various reasons,
were permitted to resume their

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:30.820
seats.
 

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:35.880
By now almost everyone expected
the restoration of the monarchy.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.715
In March 1660,
the Long Parliament voted to

00:39:39.715 --> 00:39:44.650
dissolve itself at last,
and to hold free elections.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.090
In April 1660,
Charles II appealed from exile

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:52.862
in the Netherlands in an attempt
to allay the anxieties of his

00:39:52.862 --> 00:39:57.400
former opponents and issued the
Declaration of Breda,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.594
in which he said that if
restored he would promise to

00:40:00.594 --> 00:40:02.989
respect the liberties of
parliament,

00:40:02.989 --> 00:40:07.391
he would rule by the law,
he would extend a free pardon

00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:12.188
to all former enemies,
and he would grant liberty of

00:40:12.188 --> 00:40:13.329
conscience.
 

00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:16.320
This seemed to allay all
anxieties.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.610
In April 1660,
the so-called Convention

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:24.014
Parliament met,
complete with a House of Lords,

00:40:24.014 --> 00:40:28.784
and on the 8^(th) of May
Charles II was recognized as

00:40:28.784 --> 00:40:29.518
king.
 

00:40:29.518 --> 00:40:33.724
A few weeks later on the
25^(th) of May he was brought

00:40:33.724 --> 00:40:37.239
home on a battleship,
the flagship of the navy

00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:40.994
ironically named the Naseby
after the battle at which his

00:40:40.994 --> 00:40:43.610
father had lost the first civil
war.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:48.730
It was swiftly renamed the
Royal Sovereign.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:52.250
So the revolution was over.
 

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:56.940
It had been defeated,
or one could say it had

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.860
defeated itself.
 

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.570
But it would never be forgotten
and it left a legacy.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.302
First of all,
the restored monarchy under

00:41:07.302 --> 00:41:12.246
Charles II lived under the
shadow of the events of the

00:41:12.246 --> 00:41:13.179
1640s.
 

00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:15.400
These could never be forgotten.
 

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:20.309
There were tacit understandings
about the acceptable limits of

00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:25.539
royal authority and the Stuarts
would do well to remember them.

00:41:25.539 --> 00:41:30.922
Secondly, the politicization of
a much larger section of

00:41:30.922 --> 00:41:34.186
society,
which had been part and parcel

00:41:34.186 --> 00:41:38.780
of the dynamic of the dramatic
events of the 1640s and 1650s,

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.949
was not reversed; it remained.
 

00:41:41.949 --> 00:41:46.695
Thirdly, the Church of England
could never again encompass the

00:41:46.695 --> 00:41:50.039
sheer diversity of English
Protestantism.

00:41:50.039 --> 00:41:55.166
The Church of England was
restored, but religious dissent

00:41:55.166 --> 00:41:59.380
was an enduring fact throughout
the kingdom.

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.329
And finally there was a fourth
legacy,

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:06.099
what Professor Lawrence Stone
described as "an immensely

00:42:06.099 --> 00:42:10.628
rich reservoir of ideas that
were to echo and re-echo down

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:12.139
the ages."
 

00:42:12.139 --> 00:42:14.159
Those ideas,
political ideas,

00:42:14.159 --> 00:42:18.606
religious ideas,
generated by the events and the

00:42:18.606 --> 00:42:22.380
dilemmas of the 1640s and the
1650s,

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:26.393
were in a sense what really
made the English Revolution the

00:42:26.393 --> 00:42:30.268
first of the great European and
Atlantic revolutions,

00:42:30.268 --> 00:42:32.911
and of course you will be
discussing those ideas in

00:42:32.911 --> 00:42:33.440
section.
 

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:38.193
As John Davenport put it,
observing all this from afar in

00:42:38.193 --> 00:42:42.795
1647 at the height of it all,
"the light which is now

00:42:42.795 --> 00:42:44.480
discovered in England...
 

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.693
will never be wholly put out
though I suspect that contrary

00:42:49.693 --> 00:42:53.380
opinions will prevail for a
time."

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.570
He was right.
 

00:42:56.570 --> 00:43:02.050
Okay. Oliver Cromwell's head;
we have time.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:06.630
Following the Restoration,
Cromwell's body was exhumed.

00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.239
He died of course in 1658.
 

00:43:08.239 --> 00:43:11.489
The body had been embalmed and
he'd been buried in state.

00:43:11.489 --> 00:43:16.487
His body was exhumed along with
that of Henry Ireton and they

00:43:16.487 --> 00:43:20.903
were gibbeted--the bodies were
gibbeted in public--and

00:43:20.903 --> 00:43:23.820
Cromwell's head was struck off.
 

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:30.693
It was put on a spike high on
the walls of Westminster Hall,

00:43:30.693 --> 00:43:37.333
where it remained for over
twenty years until in a gale in

00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:40.130
1684 it disappeared.
 

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:43.351
It's thought that it was
probably blown down and one of

00:43:43.351 --> 00:43:45.320
the guards took it and sold it.
 

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.567
It resurfaced in the eighteenth
century in the cabinet of

00:43:49.567 --> 00:43:53.510
curiosities of a gentleman,
then vanished again for a

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:54.268
while.
 

00:43:54.268 --> 00:43:57.855
It resurfaced again at the end
of the eighteenth century when

00:43:57.855 --> 00:44:01.440
it was put on public exhibition
and people paid to see it.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.793
Then later on in the nineteenth
century it came in to the

00:44:05.793 --> 00:44:10.224
possession of a scholarly
antiquarian clergyman who looked

00:44:10.224 --> 00:44:13.800
after it and passed it down in
his family.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.501
Eventually, in the early
twentieth century it was offered

00:44:18.501 --> 00:44:22.193
to his former college,
Sidney Sussex College,

00:44:22.193 --> 00:44:23.369
Cambridge.
 

00:44:23.369 --> 00:44:28.302
Extensive forensic examination
was done of the head to see if

00:44:28.302 --> 00:44:29.699
it was genuine.
 

00:44:29.699 --> 00:44:31.391
Well, it was a head--there's no
doubt about

00:44:31.391 --> 00:44:32.679
that--&gt;
 

00:44:32.679 --> 00:44:35.599
but it was extensively
forensically examined and an

00:44:35.599 --> 00:44:37.469
extensive report was prepared.
 

00:44:37.469 --> 00:44:42.148
Well, they decided that the
balance of probability was that

00:44:42.148 --> 00:44:44.730
it was indeed Cromwell's head.
 

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:46.722
It has a spike through it for a
start, which is really

00:44:46.722 --> 00:44:47.699
&gt;
 

00:44:47.699 --> 00:44:49.579
one clue.
 

00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:55.110
It had been embalmed.
 

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:58.179
There are still scraps of skin
and hair.

00:44:58.179 --> 00:45:01.536
The--there was other forensic
evidence consistent with

00:45:01.536 --> 00:45:04.594
Cromwell's death mask--
a plaster mask had been taken

00:45:04.594 --> 00:45:08.219
of his face after his death--
and there was even pitting on

00:45:08.219 --> 00:45:12.563
the skull in places where his
face was famously disfigured by

00:45:12.563 --> 00:45:13.940
prominent warts.
 

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:17.902
So they decided it probably was
Cromwell's head and it was

00:45:17.902 --> 00:45:21.514
eventually reburied in--
almost 300 years after it had

00:45:21.514 --> 00:45:23.530
been exhumed--
in Sidney Sussex College,

00:45:23.530 --> 00:45:26.360
Cambridge,
where it's still there.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.092
Only the master of Sidney
Sussex and the dean of the

00:45:30.092 --> 00:45:32.800
college chapel knows exactly
where.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.010
It's a closely guarded secret.
 

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:40.293
I knew someone who was elected
master of Sidney Sussex a few

00:45:40.293 --> 00:45:44.648
years ago and did suggest that
it would be nice to know but I

00:45:44.648 --> 00:45:47.480
was told very politely to get
lost.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.190
&gt;
 

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:49.940
So it's a closely guarded
secret.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.980
It's still there.
 

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:54.880
So if you go to Cambridge and
visit Sidney Sussex College and

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.844
go in to the chapel area where
it's probably buried you may be

00:45:58.844 --> 00:46:00.989
walking over Cromwell's head.
 

00:46:00.989 --> 00:46:05.606
Meanwhile, in the hall of
Sidney Sussex beside the high

00:46:05.606 --> 00:46:10.222
table they have a portrait of
Cromwell, "warts and

00:46:10.222 --> 00:46:11.420
all."
 

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.925
He famously told a portrait
painter that he didn't want to

00:46:14.925 --> 00:46:17.324
be prettied up,
paint me "warts and

00:46:17.324 --> 00:46:18.739
all," he said.
 

00:46:18.739 --> 00:46:22.635
And he is there and the
portrait has curtains and if a

00:46:22.635 --> 00:46:27.119
member of the royal family
happens to visit Sidney Sussex,

00:46:27.119 --> 00:46:30.876
which happens from time to
time, they draw the curtains

00:46:30.876 --> 00:46:34.146
across Cromwell's portrait in
order not to cause

00:46:34.146 --> 00:46:35.400
embarrassment.
 

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.630
But the rest of the time the
curtains are open and he looks

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:44.780
down on the students of his
former college,

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.570
who probably know little of his
career,

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:51.300
but there he is and make of him
what you will,

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.014
either a cynical,
power-hungry,

00:46:54.014 --> 00:46:58.447
hypocritical opportunist,
or the defender of what people

00:46:58.447 --> 00:47:01.485
still refer to as the "good
old cause,"

00:47:01.485 --> 00:47:04.240
or,
as one biographer described

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:07.067
him, "God's
Englishman,"

00:47:07.067 --> 00:47:08.780
but there we are.
 

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.130
So next week we'll turn to the
Restoration regime.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:17.000

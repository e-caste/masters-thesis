00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.840
So today's lecture is devoted,
in some sense, to this tying

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.130
up of loose ends.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.820
I have from you, 29
single-spaced pages worth of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.120
questions, which you asked in
your directed exercise nine.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.250
And I'm going to answer
all of them in detail.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.540
Actually I'm not going to answer
all of them in detail.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.080
I'm going to try to pick out
some of the ones that I think

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.750
will be of general interest and
welcome those of you whose

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.670
questions aren't answered to
come by during office hours.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.500
So one way to think about what
we do when we encounter an

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.480
article in this class is
thinking about what you do

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.900
when you encounter a building
for the first time-- say, the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.580
Eiffel Tower--

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.970
and are given guidance
about how to make

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.510
sense of that building.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.770
So one of the things that I've
tried to do for each of the

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.470
articles or books that we've
read is just to give you a

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.410
sense of its general shape.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.150
To give you a sense of what's
distinctive about it, to give

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.680
you a sense of how it's
structured internally and how

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.000
that internal structure
determines what it is that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.010
we're able to do with that
article and what it is that

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.950
that article is able
to illuminate.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.580
But I've tried, in certain
cases, to give you a sense of

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.960
the neighborhood in which that
article can be found, just as

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.220
in talking about the Eiffel
Tower, I might show you where

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.350
in Paris it's located.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.640
Or I might try to give you a
sense of how that article

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.550
relates to other approaches
of the same kind --

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.180
how the Eiffel Tower
relates to other

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.540
iconic monumental buildings.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.860
The question of the relation
between the individual

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.100
articles that we read for today
and the larger framework

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.000
is primarily something
that I'll discuss

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.320
in Thursday's lecture.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.450
Though I'll get at some of it
in comparing and contrasting

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.900
the political philosophy
views today.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.630
What I want to do a bit more of
today is to look at some of

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.570
the details of some of the
arguments and articles and

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.250
writings that we've considered
in the way that we might look

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.810
at part of a building and ask
how it's structured there,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.770
recognizing that in so doing,
there's lots of other parts of

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.870
the building to which we
don't pay attention.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.370
Or we might want to ask, with
respect to what sort of

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.600
problem is the building
constructed?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.870
Here are the plans for
the Eiffel Tower.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.160
So the goal in today's lecture
is, with regard to a number of

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.790
the questions that you raised
in your directed exercise

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.890
nine, to look at some of the
details of some of the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.180
arguments and, to a smaller
extent, to put those in a

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.750
larger framework.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.270
Now in so doing, it's
important for me to

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.510
acknowledge that there are
a tremendous number of

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.190
interesting questions that you
asked that I'm not even going

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.540
to come close to answering.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.120
There were a large number of
very interesting questions

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.740
about the connections between
the political philosophy of

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.190
Rawls and Nozick, for example,
and the U.S. Constitution.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.120
I'm not going to have anything
to say about that.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.760
There were questions asked about
the childhoods of the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.180
various authors that we read
and how that might have

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.590
affected their views.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.920
I'm not going to have much
to say about that.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.620
And perhaps my favorite
question: I was asked, if I

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.830
could have coffee at Blue State
with any one of the

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.790
authors that we had read this
semester, who would I choose?

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.700
And I guess I wouldn't choose
Robert Nozick because he

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.480
wouldn't want to go
to Blue State.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.650
But beyond that it's
hard to know how

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.750
to answer that question.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.510
So what I'm going to do today
is basically in three parts.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.860
The first large part of the
lecture, I'm going to go over

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.900
in some detail a leftover
item from our

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.240
lecture two classes ago.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.030
That is, say a little bit about
Cass Sunstein on norms.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.580
And I'm going to use that as a
way of segueing into certain

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.970
puzzles that we face about
heuristics and the question of

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.180
how those fit into the dual
processing tradition.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.920
But that will also be a major
focus of Thursday's lecture.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.590
So please don't be disappointed
if I don't get to

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.300
your question in that section.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.640
And then I'll close that section
by identifying for

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.690
you, a cluster of courses that
you might be interested in

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.370
taking if that was the part of
this class that interested you

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.100
most.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.500
I'll then have some things to
say about the political

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.330
philosophy section
of the course.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.910
And I'll close today's lecture
with the moral philosophy

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.210
section of the course, each time
indicating places to go

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.470
next if you were particularly
moved by some of the readings

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.980
that we did.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.080
So let's start with a somewhat
detailed introduction to what

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:34.030
it is that Cass Sunstein said
in the 1996 article that we

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.500
read for last Tuesday's class.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.470
What Sunstein is attempting
to do in that piece is to

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.150
identify the ways in which our
attitudes towards certain

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.230
kinds of behaviors on our part
and the part of others towards

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.430
certain sorts of decisions on
our part and the part of

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.800
others are affected by what he
calls, drawing from a large

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.110
body of sociological literature,
social norms.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.710
Social norms are basically
social attitudes of approval

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:18.040
and disapproval that specify,
through the kinds of tacit

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.130
mechanisms that human beings
as social primates have for

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.990
expressing disapproval
and approval of

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.720
one's and other's actions.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.000
That is, social attitudes of
approval and disapproval

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.070
specifying what ought
to be done and what

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.110
ought not to be done.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.820
Subtle things like nuanced
facial expressions,

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.880
approaches, avoidances, all of
the social cues to which we

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.150
are extraordinarily sensitive
in infancy, to which we are

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.202
extraordinarily sensitive in our
early years, to which we

00:07:00.202 --> 00:07:05.520
are absolutely, exquisitely
sensitive in middle school and

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.750
high school.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.680
And to which we continue to be
sensitive throughout our life.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.870
What Sunstein points out is that
social norms determine

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:16.930
social meanings.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.420
That is, they determine the
attitudes and commitments that

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.750
a particular type of
conduct signals.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.860
So, he points out, if you fasten
your seatbelt in a

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:38.270
country where seatbelt use is
not the norm then you express

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:46.330
in so doing implicit criticism
of the ability of your driver

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.320
to navigate the car effectively
on the highway.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.539
Fastening your seatbelt
is an insult.

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:59.250
When my family and I rent cars
in Eastern Europe, where my

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.270
husband is from, rental cars
typically come, if you don't

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.840
rent them from a major agency,
with a small metal plate that

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.670
you can slide into the seatbelt
lock without having a

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.250
seatbelt attached to it so
that the annoying beeping

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.230
sound goes off and you
don't have to wear

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.640
your insulting seatbelt.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.300
Whereas in nations where
seatbelt use is the norm,

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.690
where seatbelt use is in fact
the law, the failure to fasten

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:39.330
your seatbelt is an expression
of disrespect.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.590
When I was growing up my
family, to my great

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:48.650
embarrassment, separated its
vegetable scraps from its

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.600
paper scraps and put them
in the backyard

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.910
into a compost heap.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:00.250
The social meaning of a compost
heap in the 1970s in

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:07.460
suburban Massachusetts was
one of non-normativity.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:13.880
It was one of an expression,
perhaps, that we were more

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.770
socially conscious than our
neighbors, perhaps thought we

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.890
were better than
our neighbors.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:25.320
But whatever it was it wasn't
a way of fitting in.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.750
It is now the case in large
portions of America that a

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.460
compost heap or the carrying
of a recyclable bag or the

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.170
replacement of your light bulb
with a full-spectrum long-term

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:44.370
bulb simply expresses respect
for the environment rather

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.810
than an outlier attitude.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.300
My Hungarian nephew, when he
came to visit us this summer,

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:57.640
wore what he thought to be
very stylish Iron Maiden

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.110
t-shirts, which in Budapest were
in expression of cool.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:09.170
In our suburban Connecticut
environment, his actions were

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:14.230
often misperceived as rebellious
because of the

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.780
social signals that
his clothing sent.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:23.420
So the reason that I had you
read the Sunstein article in

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.670
the context of our political
philosophy discussion was to

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:35.030
point out to you how many more
layers of complexity there are

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.950
when we start thinking about
what kind of social structures

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.920
are legitimate.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.250
There was, in addition, a very
particular question about the

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.180
Sunstein article, which was
raised in the context of our

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.930
feedback page, about which I
want to say a small bit by way

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.730
of transition.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:02.120
So one of the students asked
whether I could characterize

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.890
Sunstein's somewhat complicated
argument about

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.390
willingness to pay and
willingness to allow.

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:11.640
So what we're doing now is
we're looking at a very

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.440
particular girder of a very
particular argument.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.760
So Sunstein in that article, you
may recall, introduces a

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.480
discussion of what's known as
the endowment effect, which is

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.730
basically the tendency of human
beings to demand more to

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.510
give up an owned object then
they would be prepared to pay

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.720
to acquire that object.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.120
And the term for how much it is
that somebody's willing to

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:51.300
sell something for is WTA,
willingness to accept payment,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.040
whereas the term for that which
somebody's willing to

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:00.400
pay for an object is WTP,
or willingness to pay.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:08.290
It turns out that if I have a
beautiful Yale mug, which I

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:16.090
seek to sell to you, that our
assessments of its value will

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:18.720
very often differ.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.990
I may well say that I won't part
with my beautiful mug for

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.350
anything less than $10.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.610
Whereas you say, "I wouldn't
buy your crappy old mug for

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.610
anything more than $5." Even
if, when we alter the

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.610
situation and you have the
mug and I don't, our

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.800
responses are inverted.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.320
I wouldn't buy your crappy old
mug for anything more than $5

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:48.950
and you wouldn't part with it
for anything less than $10.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:54.830
Now Sunstein, 15 years ago in
this article, hypothesizes

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:00.440
that what explains this effect
is primarily something about

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:06.520
social norms. It looks like, at
least to some extent, that

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.850
he was wrong about that.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.350
At least that he was wrong
that social norms fully

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.670
explain the phenomena.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.810
Because research done in Laurie
Santos lab at this very

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:24.380
university in the last five
years seems to suggest that

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:28.490
something akin to the endowment
effect can be found

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.660
even in Capuchin monkeys.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:38.380
A tendency to value more that
which is yours than that which

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:43.650
is not, even when the objects
are identical.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:49.590
That said, there is still reason
to think that Sunstein

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.950
is on to something when he
argues that the willingness to

00:13:54.950 --> 00:14:00.680
pay, willingness to allow
distinction, in some ways is

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.720
tracking something about
social meaning.

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.460
So he points out that in a
series of studies done in the

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:16.570
context of behavioral economics
with WEIRD subjects

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:21.660
near the University of Chicago,
for at least Western,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.850
educated, industrialized, rich,
democratic, adults, it

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:32.240
looks like this asymmetry
is rather profound.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.150
So he described this study,
the details of which I had

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:40.760
thought I would go through but I
won't, in which what you see

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.550
is a rather radical asymmetry
in subject's willingness to

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:51.730
either acquire an object from
another or part with an object

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:54.200
that they own.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.050
Sunstein's response to these
sorts of cases is to suggest

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.470
that the difference here has a
lot to do with social norms

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.270
and meanings.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:08.730
So that being willing to, for
example accept a certain

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:14.730
amount of money to allow the
extinction of a species has a

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:18.460
very different social
meaning than--

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.860
what you might think of as
structurally the same--

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.710
accepting, or being willing to
pay a certain amount of money

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.570
to prevent the extinction
of the species.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:36.450
Whether you consider the state
of the world where the species

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:40.980
is extinct or whether you
consider the state of the

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:45.340
world where the species is
present and it's your job to

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.840
save it, to be the baseline,
turns out to affect people's

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.890
evaluation of it.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:57.120
And Sunstein suggests in the
article, more generally, that

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.430
numerous of our actions,
numerous of our decisions, are

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.180
driven at least in part
by internal and

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.086
external social meaning.

00:16:08.086 --> 00:16:13.030
And that, as a consequence,
an effective mechanism for

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:17.970
influencing actions and
decisions is to influence the

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.320
social meanings of those
actions and decisions.

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:27.944
So that, he suggests, it turns
out to be an inevitable role

00:16:27.944 --> 00:16:37.210
of government to regulate
behavior by the affirmation or

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:40.670
introduction or disavowal
of certain

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.560
kinds of social meaning.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.660
And we address the issue of
this sort of indirect

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.240
non-rational control of behavior
in the context of our

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.880
discussion of Plato
on censorship.

00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:00.590
Now this distinction between
willingness to pay and

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.090
willingness to allow, the
details of which we're now

00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:09.670
going to set aside, can be used
to think about one of the

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.320
examples, which we talked about
in many lectures and

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.660
which we'll talk about
again on Thursday.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:22.410
Namely, the fact that there is
an undeniable tendency of

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:28.860
people, this class included, to
respond differently to the

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.222
classic trolley case, where one
diverts a trolley from a

00:17:33.222 --> 00:17:36.810
track where it's about to hit
five onto a track where it's

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:42.390
about to hit one, and trolley
cases involving pushing

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:45.700
someone off a bridge.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:52.650
So whereas the first one among
you produced only 15% of you

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.830
saying that it was prohibited
to turn the trolley, the

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:59.840
second case, the one where
you're asked to push the fat

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:05.050
man off the bridge, thereby
killing one and saving five,

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:10.770
produced among you
a 78% conclusion

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.420
that the act was forbidden.

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:19.930
Next lecture we'll talk a lot
about how to reconcile

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.180
intuitions about particular
cases with more general

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.280
principled commitment.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:31.160
But what I want to do now is
just, by way of answering a

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.070
couple of questions, point out
to you three different ways

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.780
that one might respond
to what's

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:42.680
going on in this asymmetry.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:48.480
One might, making use of the
vocabulary that Sunstein just

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:53.920
introduced, say that what's
going on in the case of fat

00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:00.060
man is a case where one's being
asked to accept a cost.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:05.200
Accept the cost of having one
die in order to save five.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.220
Whereas what's going on in the
case of the switch is that

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.850
one's being asked to pay a cost
-- something that wasn't

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.860
part of the calculus
to begin with --

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.900
pay a cost of having one
die to save five.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:27.410
And we know as a matter
of general theory,

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:28.960
that the way human--

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.840
and perhaps even non-human --

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:41.270
primate accounting works, that
that the cost of accepting

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:46.880
something feels higher to us
than the cost of paying.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:52.530
So perhaps what's going on in
the trolley cases is that we

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:57.320
are assimilating them, by means
of a heuristic mechanism

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.700
that we often use, to a familiar
kind of reasoning

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:08.180
process, one that may or may
not be tracking our moral

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.090
commitments.

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:14.410
Or perhaps as the cases were
originally suggested to show,

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.645
what we're tracking here in our
different responses is a

00:20:18.645 --> 00:20:25.060
deep and profound morally real
distinction between violating

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:31.590
rights and considering utility,
where in cases that

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:36.910
violating rights comes into
play, letting one die or

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.450
killing one in order to save
five is morally wrong.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:46.090
Whereas in cases where rights
don't come into play, letting

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.830
one die or killing one to save
five is morally acceptable.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:57.280
Or perhaps what's going on in
this case is, as Josh Greene

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.240
suggests on the basis of his
neuroimaging work, that in one

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.390
of the cases we're responding
emotionally and in the other

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:10.250
case we're responding
rationally.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:16.000
What the first and the third,
but not the second, response

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.470
have in common --

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.380
that is, what the two responses
that suggest we

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:26.440
should take as differentially
informative our responses to

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.360
the fat man case and our
responses to the bystander

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.600
case suggest --

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.510
is that in thinking about these
cases we are thinking

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:42.810
about one of them primarily with
one mode of thought and

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:48.380
the other primarily with another
mode of thought.

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:54.500
And throughout the course, we
have been introduced to the

00:21:54.500 --> 00:22:00.880
fact that in every intellectual
tradition there

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:07.410
has been a suggestion that human
understanding of the

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:12.990
world proceeds in
multiple ways.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:18.420
The contemporary scientific
vernacular of this makes use

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.050
of the notion of dual
processing.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.650
It suggests that there are
two systems: System

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.830
one and system two.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.810
Where system one is
evolutionarily primitive and

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:37.250
shared with non-human animals,
whereas system two is

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:42.010
evolutionarily recent and
shared, if with any animals at

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:47.350
all, only with those closest
to us in the

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:49.750
evolutionary tree.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.560
System one is unconscious or
preconscious whereas system

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.680
two is conscious.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.520
System one is automatic
whereas system two is

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.660
controlled.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:01.430
System one is effortless
whereas

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.790
system two is effortful.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.210
System one is fast whereas
system two is slow.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:11.690
System one is associative
whereas system two is

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.410
rule-based.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.740
Now one of the things that
we've done throughout the

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:24.720
course is to look at various
ways of getting at the

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:29.740
distinction that this particular
version gets at

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:35.690
without trying to decide which
of these frameworks is the one

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:38.610
that's most useful
in all contexts.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.750
But rather, by recognizing that
in certain domains it may

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.260
be useful to speak, as Plato
does, of spirit and appetite

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.350
pulling in one direction and
reason pulling in another.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:56.010
That it might be useful in some
contexts to speak as I do

00:23:56.010 --> 00:24:01.480
of alief causing certain kinds
of nonreflective behaviors

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.050
while belief causes certain
kinds of reflective ones.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:10.070
That it might be useful in
some contexts to speak of

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:15.000
heuristics as causing us to
respond in one sort of way and

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.140
full cognition--

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.000
or reflection --

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.180
in causing us to respond
in another.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:25.010
But it's important to know
that in picking out those

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:29.840
three particular ways that we
looked at this overarching

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:36.400
distinction, that we neglected
to look at the many, many

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.340
other sorts of dual processing
accounts.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:45.020
Here are 15 or so taken from the
Evans article that we read

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.640
in mid-January.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.800
And that for the purposes of our
discussion in this course,

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:57.830
the similarities among these
views are more relevant than

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.980
the differences.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:06.950
If however, you are intrigued by
the set of questions, which

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:12.180
I've just quickly run through,
there are numerous

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.670
places to go next.

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:20.900
Most of the courses offered by
the cognitive science program

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:25.400
look at the sorts of issues
that I've just been

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.870
discussing.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.940
How is human reasoning affected
by structural

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.620
features of the brain?

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.700
To what extent can we
systematize the sorts of

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.440
errors that human beings seem
to make in reasoning?

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:45.390
To what extent are those
sorts of errors-- or

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.160
what we call errors--

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:52.490
actually effective means for
navigating various sorts of

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:54.230
environments?

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:56.720
You can also look at these
sorts of questions in the

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.090
context of social psychology,
cognitive psychology,

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.580
developmental psychology, and
there will be numerous courses

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.460
offered in psychology next year
that will go in much more

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.310
depth into the questions that
I've just been mentioning.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.350
The School of Management offers
courses in behavioral

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:18.400
economics, which are open to
undergraduates who have the

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.870
requisite background.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:24.750
And in the context of the
philosophy department, there

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:30.350
are historical courses that look
seriously and in depth at

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.520
Plato alone.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.050
Indeed there's a course this
semester that just reads

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:36.990
Plato's Republic.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:39.260
There are courses that
at Aristotle

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:40.690
or Aristotle's ethics.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:45.440
Courses that look at each of
the authors that we've been

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.860
considering.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.780
So intrigued by what we've
just talked about,

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:54.130
many places to go.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:58.330
Second big cluster of topics
that I want to address

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.840
questions with regard to.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.120
I was asked--

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.970
perhaps because they
came so recently--

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:10.130
by almost a third of the
questions, to discuss again

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:14.510
the relation between Nozick
and Rawls and to say

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:19.560
something, perhaps, about how
that fits together with Hobbes

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.980
and the social contract
theory.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.110
So borrowing from my colleague
Thomas Pogge, here's a helpful

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:30.490
way for thinking about
the difference among

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.860
the three of them.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.450
And I'll give you first an
overview of the difference and

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:41.500
then try to present you with a
systematic explanation of just

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:47.110
where Hobbes, Rawls and Nozick
are similar and different.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:52.660
So all three of them are working
in what is known as

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.360
the social contract tradition.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.670
All three of them are making the
contention that it is in a

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.470
certain kind of interest on the
part of human beings to

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:11.960
contract into a certain sort of
social structure even if in

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:18.430
so doing they give up some
of their freedom.

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:25.540
Hobbes argues that it is of
prudential utility for us to

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.190
engage in a social contract.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:36.260
We are better off than we would
have been had we not

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:39.550
been part of a state.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:44.880
But the state of nature to
which Hobbes appeals is a

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.370
purely imaginary one.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:53.050
It is a hypothetical contract,
whose value to us is

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.310
prudential.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:29:03.510
Rawls suggests that it is of
moral utility for us to engage

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:08.490
in the sort of social contract
that the Rawlsian state

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.070
represents.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.990
We imaginarily go into the
original position behind the

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:15.250
veil of ignorance.

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:20.900
And in so doing come up with
something morally worthy.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:31.150
Nozick, in contrast, to Rawls
is concerned with how things

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.640
actually came into being.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:40.540
But like Rawls is interested
in what sort of moral

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.300
justification that provides.

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.460
So whereas Hobbes is interested
in what a

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.790
hypothetical contract tells us
about what's prudential for

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.820
us, Rawls is interested in what
a hypothetical contract

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.010
tells us about what's moral and
Nozick is interested in

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:06.830
what a certain historical set
of events, where that stands

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.240
with respect to morality.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.520
So let's start by looking
at Hobbes' argument.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:20.720
Hobbes presents us, in Leviathan
with what he calls

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.520
the state of nature.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.680
An imaginary situation, what
the "manner of life there

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.570
would be with no common power
to fear." Where life is

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:37.090
"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish
and short." And he

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:43.620
suggests that our prudential
aim, that which is of use to

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.410
us, is to escape the
state of nature.

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.990
Why?

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:54.010
Because all of us have a "fear
of death, the desire for

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:58.860
commodious living, and the hope
that by our industry we

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:07.302
might obtain it." But, says
Hobbes, that gives rise, if we

00:31:07.302 --> 00:31:11.090
think about the fact that being
in the state of nature

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:17.360
is bad for us, to a number
of rationally mandated

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.010
conclusions, of which
we examined three.

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:25.120
These are what Hobbes calls
the laws of nature.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:30.450
The things, which we realize
rationality demands of us if

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:35.410
we have the prudential aim
of commodious living.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:39.030
In particular, we need to seek
peace if there's a chance of

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:42.210
obtaining peace and if not
reserve for ourselves the

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.210
right of war.

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:44.890
First law of nature.

00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:48.130
We need to lay down our rights
to the extent that others are

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:49.390
willing to do the same.

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:51.090
Second law of nature.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:55.310
And we need to perform our
covenants, that is keep our

00:31:55.310 --> 00:32:00.090
promises, assuming that others
are willing to do the same.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:07.980
But there is a structural
problem with our doing so.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.900
The structural problem is the
one articulated by the

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.940
Prisoners' Dilemma.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:20.230
And because of that, says
Hobbes, the only way that we

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:24.680
can do what rationality demands
of us: seek peace, lay

00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.100
down our rights and perform our
covenants, thereby acting

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.910
on the first half of each of
these clauses, is if we

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:36.210
institute an authoritarian
government.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:41.510
A civil power sufficient to
compel non-defection in a

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.540
prisoners' dilemma.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.580
So note the four key steps.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.110
Because I'm going to go through
these next with Rawls

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.710
and next with Nozick.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:54.720
We're interested in a situation,
a rationally

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:56.700
mandated conclusion and a

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.640
structurally mandated mechanism.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.650
So how does it go for Rawls?

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:04.440
Rawls says, look.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:08.480
Let's consider the following
hypothetical situation.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.470
The original position, where
we sit behind the veil of

00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:17.760
ignorance, not knowing who we
will be in society, and choose

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:23.470
the basic structures by which
our society will be governed.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:29.719
The aim that we engage in this
activity with is the aim of

00:33:29.719 --> 00:33:32.570
articulating the conditions
of a just society.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:33.530
Why?

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:37.639
Because "justice is the first
virtue of social institutions

00:33:37.639 --> 00:33:42.560
just as truth is the first
virtue of theoretical

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.480
systems." It is the aim of
articulating a political

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:52.989
philosophy to come up with one
that respects our moral norms.

00:33:52.989 --> 00:33:57.520
Just as it is Hobbes's aim in
articulating the constraints

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.190
that govern a legitimate
political society to identify

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.900
one that respects our
prudential norms.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:10.260
What then is the rationally
mandated conclusion of taking

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:15.080
this hypothetical situation
and this particular aim?

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:19.480
Well, says Rawls, just as Hobbes
thought, thinking about

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:23.810
the structure of the state of
nature gives us, through

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.560
rationality, the three
laws of nature.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:31.150
So too does Rawls think,
thinking about the structure

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:35.110
of the original position with
the aim of developing a moral

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:39.230
society, give us the principles
of justice.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:43.730
In particular, the first equal
liberty principle: that in no

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:48.040
circumstances are the
fundamental rights of the one

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.030
to be sacrificed for the
utility of the many.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:56.250
And second, that to the extent
that there are inequalities in

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:59.250
the society, those are to be
associated with positions

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:03.620
fairly open to all and in
such a way that they are

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:07.580
advantageous to the
least well off.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:12.270
Moreover, Rawls thinks not
just about a hypothetical

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.520
situation and the moral aim and
the rationally mandated

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:20.110
conclusion that we can draw from
that, but also about what

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:25.040
sort of mechanism, what sort
of structure that tells us

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.750
society needs to have. And his
suggestion is that it becomes

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:34.730
roughly one with equality and
basic rights and duties.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:37.510
Freedom of speech, freedom
of expression, freedom of

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:40.300
thought, an equal responsibility
to make a

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.550
contribution to the upkeep of
the community as a whole.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:51.380
And because of facts about
efficiency, Rawls is ready to,

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:56.300
at least tentatively, endorse,
as one effective mechanism

00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:01.630
towards this, a market economy
with some tendency towards

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:03.790
redistribution.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:10.010
So notice that it is an argument
almost parallel to

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.340
the one that Hobbes makes.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.170
We take a hypothetical
situation.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:16.720
We have an aim.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:20.760
We reason our way through the
situation and determine

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.110
certain sorts of constraints.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.720
And then we identify
what kind of social

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.630
structure that gives us.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:31.450
Let's look next at what
that gives us in

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:34.390
the context of Nozick.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:38.490
Nozick's interested, not in a
hypothetical situation, but in

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.040
a historical situation.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:45.260
In particular, he's interested
in what we should do about the

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.900
fact that a particular
distribution of resources has

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.540
resulted from a series
of just transfers.

00:36:54.540 --> 00:37:00.120
A series of transfers where
property was acquired in a

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.970
legitimate way and transferred
in a legitimate way regardless

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:10.180
of what that pattern produced.

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:15.610
Notice that although we read
only Nozick's discussion of

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.280
justice in holding and
consequently we looked at a

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:23.530
rather narrow question of under
what conditions it is

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:28.040
legitimate to own property, that
Nozick's argument with

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.630
respect to holdings can be
generalized with respect to

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:36.170
any sort of decision
that people make.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:40.340
What makes holdings legitimate
on Nozick's picture is that

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:44.060
they are the result of
a legitimate process.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:49.620
And as a consequence, any sort
of contract that we enter into

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:54.990
in a way that Nozick will call
free will end up being in the

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:57.350
same historical category.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:02.090
So what Nozick is interested in
is the question: given that

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:05.620
things as a matter of historical
contingency happen

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:09.070
to end up the way they are in
terms of the distribution of

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:14.550
goods and in terms of the
distribution of contracts,

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:20.300
what sort of moral force
does that have?

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.020
Nozick's goal is to determine
whether this

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.620
distribution of holdings--

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.790
that is property--

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:26.950
and contracts--

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.350
that is commitment--

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:30.840
is a legitimate one.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.480
And his suggestion is that as
long as property is justly

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.720
acquired and justly transferred,
then whatever

00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.430
distribution results from that
is a just distribution.

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:45.740
And you'll recall that we
looked in some detail at

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.990
Nozick's idea of just
acquisition, where he

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:53.970
basically says, an object is
legitimately held if it was

00:38:53.970 --> 00:39:00.280
acquired in a way where the
value that you add to the

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:06.820
object makes your possession
of it leave others no worse

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.720
off than they would be had you
not acquired the object.

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:17.000
And where just transfers are
any that are engaged in

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.760
voluntarily.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.630
One result of that, as we know
from the Wilt Chamberlain

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:27.680
example, is that even if we
begin with a perfectly even

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:32.960
distribution of goods across
individuals, it's almost

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:38.170
guaranteed that we will end
up with an unequal one.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:41.450
And notice that exactly the same
sort of argument that can

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:46.020
be raised for distribution of
property can be raised for the

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:48.862
distribution of obligations.

00:39:48.862 --> 00:39:52.040
So Nozick's interested in
historical situation.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.330
He has a moral aim, namely
determining whether the

00:39:54.330 --> 00:40:00.180
distribution is just. And the
conclusion that he draws, as a

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.580
result of thinking about that
structure, is that any

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.450
intervention into justly
generated distribution of

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:14.750
holdings or contracts is
a violation of rights.

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.360
After all, the only things
that matter to whether

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:22.870
holdings are just, on Nozick's
picture, is whether they were

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:25.390
justly acquired of justly
transferred.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:30.785
And the fact that, as a matter
of coordination problems of

00:40:30.785 --> 00:40:33.820
the kind that we face in the
problem of the commons, the

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:37.430
fact that that will inevitably
result in distributions that

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:43.980
are unequal is of no concern
to the sort of historical

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:46.400
picture that Nozick has.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.520
Likewise, the fact that as
a result of historical

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.020
contingency, I may end up
contracted in a way that

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.650
leaves me subordinate to you is,
according to Nozick, in no

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:03.690
way unjust because no
intervention into a justly

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:07.060
generated process
can be performed

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:09.090
without violating rights.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:14.070
So the structurally mandated
mechanism which Nozick ends up

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:19.130
advocating is that of
the minimal state.

00:41:19.130 --> 00:41:24.470
So what's the picture among our
political philosophers?

00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:26.570
The idea is this.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.130
Hobbes is interested in
thinking about what a

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:33.380
hypothetical state of nature,
considered from the

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:39.270
perspective of prudence,
tells us is rational.

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:44.200
What it tells us is rational
are certain laws of nature,

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.520
the enforcement of which is
possible only through the

00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:53.170
introduction of an authoritarian
state.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:56.720
Rawls asks us to think
hypothetically from the

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.250
position of the veil of
ignorance, what it would take

00:42:01.250 --> 00:42:05.490
for us to have a moral society,
concludes that it

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:09.040
would be governed by the
principles of justice, and

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.250
identifies as a mechanism what
I've called, because there

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.600
wasn't much room
here, "Sweden."

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:23.670
And Nozick asks what we can
do given that an actual

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:27.830
distribution arose as the
result of a bunch fair

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:32.740
transfers and concludes that
if our goal is to respect

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:39.400
rights, then the only state
which is legitimate is the

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.180
minimal state.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:46.650
So we spent roughly four
classes on political

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.040
philosophy.

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:51.940
Where to go if you want more?

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.310
The Philosophy department offers
political philosophy

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:59.070
courses, both survey courses
and courses on each of the

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:00.960
individuals that we've read.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:04.530
You can take a course surveying
political philosophy

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:07.170
from Plato past Nozick.

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:10.560
You can take a course on any one
of the individual authors.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:13.510
The Political Science
department, likewise, offers

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.700
historically structured courses
and courses on our

00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.540
individual authors.

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:22.480
Nearly every course listed in
the Ethics, Politics and

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:27.000
Economics department is a course
that will address the

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.800
kinds of questions that I just
mentioned in this chart.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.460
And in the context of the
Economics department and

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:38.310
indeed in three or four other
departments, you can think

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:42.680
about game theory as a way of
representing these structures

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.380
or think about policy
in the context

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.830
of an economic framework.

00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:51.710
It's 11:19.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:55.550
I will integrate the discussion
of morality and the

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:57.850
answers to those questions
into our

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.100
final lecture on Thursday.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:04.200
But it's my hope that even if I
didn't answer all 500 of the

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.920
questions that I was asked for
today that the lecture gave

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.540
you some sense of how some of
the pieces fit together.

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:14.060
And we'll continue
on Thursday.

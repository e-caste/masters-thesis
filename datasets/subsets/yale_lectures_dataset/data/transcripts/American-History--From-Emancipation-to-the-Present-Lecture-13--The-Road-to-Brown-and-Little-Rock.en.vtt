00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.467
 I want to start with, I
guess for lack of a better

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:23.967
word, two vignettes.&nbsp; One,
and it really is lack of a

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:29.867
better word, vignette
is actually a series of,

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:32.667
of statistics.&nbsp; You don't
need to keep them from your

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.367
notes, but I want you to
understand them from an

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.800
impressionistic point of
view.&nbsp; These--this is a

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.400
tallying of the state of
segregation in 1951.&nbsp; It's a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:51.000
random point in time in
the South.&nbsp; In May of 1951,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.367
the state of Texas did not
allow interracial boxing

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:57.900
matches.&nbsp; Florida did
not allow white and black

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.900
students to use the same
editions of textbooks.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.300
In Alabama, a white woman
was not allowed to take care

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.900
of a black male patient.&nbsp;
North Carolina required

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.767
separate washrooms in its
factories.&nbsp; South Carolina

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:18.267
required them in its cotton
mills.&nbsp; Four other states

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:21.300
required them
in their mines.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.467
In six
states--and there's a,

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:25.500
I'm going to be reading a
list in numbers of states.&nbsp;

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200
They're overlapping in
different combinations,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.100
I'm quite
sure--in six states,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.967
white and black prisoners
could not be chained

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:34.567
together.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
seven states, parks,

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:37.300
playgrounds, bathing
and fishing and boating

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.500
facilities, amusement
parks, race tracks,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.400
pool halls, circuses,
theaters and public halls

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.867
were all segregated.&nbsp; Ten
states required separate

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:50.800
waiting rooms for bus and
train travelers.&nbsp; Fourteen

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.067
states required black
passengers to ride in the

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:57.100
back of buses and
streetcars.&nbsp; Some other

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.900
combination of fourteen
states segregated railroad

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.700
passengers on trips within
their borders.&nbsp; Some other

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.400
combination of
fourteen states required

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.667
mental--segregated mental
patients.&nbsp; Some seventeen

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:12.700
states required segregation
of public schools.&nbsp; Four

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.567
other states permitted
the practice if local

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.600
communities
wished it.&nbsp; And in,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.700
and in Washington, D.C.,
the custom had prevailed for

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.267
nearly ninety
years.&nbsp; In eleven,

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.200
in eleven states--and
this one I find is actually

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.167
breathtaking for the
absurdity of all of this,

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:34.300
or maybe even the passion
for all of this--in eleven

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.467
states, eleven states
operated separate schools

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:41.100
for the blind.&nbsp; So even
if you could not see each

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.900
other, you could not be in
the same space if you were

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.567
white and if you were
black.&nbsp; It's a thoroughgoing

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.700
segregation across
many different lines,

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.400
many different vectors, of
how you operate as a citizen

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.600
in the world.&nbsp;
Now that's 1950,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600
'51.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.200
I want to read to you an
excerpt from the memoir

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.600
Warriors Don't
Cry by Melba Beals,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.500
who was one of the, who
would become one of the,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400
would become one of
the Little Rock Nine,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.200
who'd deseg--desegregate
Central High School.&nbsp; We'll

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.300
be talking--I'll talk a
little bit about Central

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.700
High School in Monday's
lecture.&nbsp; We're actually

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.100
chronologically not getting
up to that point in today's

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.800
lecture.&nbsp; But I want to
read to you an excerpt from

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.967
1954--of events that
happened in 1954--to help

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:41.000
underscore, undergird the
extent to which the kind of

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.567
higher level organizing
and political work and legal

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:46.900
affairs that will be the
bulk of today's lecture,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.900
to underscore the way in
which these things really

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.600
made themselves manifest on
the ground.&nbsp; So Melba Beals

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.967
writes very
early in her book,

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:56.900
reflecting back
to when she was,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.800
I believe, twelve years
old.&nbsp; She's walking back

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.800
home from school on
the day that Brown v.,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.300
Brown v., Brown versusthe
Board of Education decision

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.600
had been announced.&nbsp; And
teachers all--the teachers

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.300
told their
students, black teachers,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.967
black students,
"Go straight home.

00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:14.100
Don't take any shortcuts.&nbsp;
Just go straight home."

00:04:16.267 --> 00:04:17.767
"As I entered the
persimmon field,

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.867
I sank deep
into my thoughts,

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:21.900
but a few steps past the
big tree at the front of the

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.900
path, I heard a rustling
sound.&nbsp; I stood perfectly

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.367
still, looking all around.

00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:27.900
I didn't see a soul.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.900
Suddenly, as I came near
to the end of the field,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.200
a man's gravel voice
snatched me from the secret

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.000
place in my head.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.800
'You want a ride, girl?'
He didn't sound at all like

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.800
anybody I knew.&nbsp;
There it was again,

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.267
that stranger's voice
calling out to me.&nbsp; 'Want a

00:04:42.267 --> 00:04:45.700
ride?' 'Who is it?' I asked,
barely able to squeeze the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.100
words out.&nbsp; 'I got
candy in the car,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.600
lots of candy.'
I crept forward,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.700
and then I saw
him--a big white man,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.800
even taller than my
father, broad and huge,

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.900
like a wrestler.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.200
He was coming
toward me fast.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.100
I turned on my heels
and fled in the opposite

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.800
direction, back
the way I had come.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.300
'You'd better come on
and take a ride home,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.900
you hear me girl?'
'No sir!' I yelled,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.767
'No, thank you,'
but he kept coming.

00:05:08.767 --> 00:05:10.700
My heart was racing
almost as fast as my feet.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.567
I couldn't hear anything
except for the sound of my

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:14.800
saddle shoes pounding the
ground and the thud of his

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.400
feet close behind me.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.567
That's when he started
talking about 'niggers'

00:05:18.567 --> 00:05:20.700
wanting to go to school
with his children and how he

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.567
wasn't going to
stand for it.

00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:25.300
My cries for help drowned
out the sound of his words,

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.100
but he laughed and said it
was no use because nobody

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.000
would hear me.&nbsp; I was
running as fast as I could.&nbsp;

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.900
The lace on my shoe came
untied and my feet got

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.800
tangled.&nbsp; As I
hit the ground,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.200
I bit down hard on my
tongue.&nbsp; I felt his strong

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.200
hands clutch my back.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.000
I bolted up, struggling to
get away.&nbsp; He pulled me down

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.400
and turned me on my back.&nbsp;
I looked up into his face,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.367
looming close above me
like the monster on a movie

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:49.967
screen.&nbsp; I struggled against
him but he was too strong.&nbsp;

00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:52.000
He slapped me hard across
the face.&nbsp; I covered my eyes

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.500
with my hands and waited
for him to strike me again.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.067
Instead, I felt him
squirm against me,

00:05:57.067 --> 00:05:59.600
and then I saw him
taking his pants down.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.500
In my house, private parts
were always kept private.&nbsp; I

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.900
couldn't figure out
what he was doing,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.500
but I knew it had to be
bad.&nbsp; I scratched and kicked

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500
and thrashed against him
with every ounce of strength

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.200
I could muster.&nbsp; His huge
fists smashed hard against

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200
my face.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.300
I struggled to push him back
and to keep the dark curtain

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.100
of unconsciousness
from descending over me.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.567
'I'll show you niggers the
Supreme Court can't run my

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:21.667
life,' he said, as
he--as his hand ripped at my

00:06:21.667 --> 00:06:24.900
underpants.&nbsp; A voice inside
my head told me I was going

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.400
to die, but there was
nothing I could do about

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.900
it.&nbsp; White men
were in charge."

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:34.900
Someone comes to her rescue
within about four or five

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.267
seconds of this moment,
before she's actually raped.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.500
One of her classmates she
didn't really know that well

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.000
knocks the guy over the head
with a brick and she's able

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to escape to safety.&nbsp; Thus
begins her journey towards

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.200
becoming one of the Little
Rock Nine.&nbsp; These are the

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.867
memories of a twelve year
old.&nbsp; Now I want to set that

00:06:56.867 --> 00:07:01.067
stage about systemic
segregation and the ways in

00:07:01.067 --> 00:07:05.467
which people were, I
mean from my personal

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:10.000
perspective, were driven
mad by the Supreme--Supreme

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.100
Court decision of '54.&nbsp;
To sort of underscore,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.800
for lack of a better phrase,
the intensity of the moment,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.567
a period of profound
ambiguity in this country

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:30.100
and a period of profound
change for blacks as well as

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.367
whites, conservatives as
well as liberals.&nbsp; And over

00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:37.000
the course of today's
lecture and really Monday's

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.300
lecture, we're going to
start canvassing the ways in

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.600
which--[student sneezes]
Bless You--the ways in which

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.500
this period of, of
incredible instability in

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.300
the United States was made,
was felt on many different

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:57.300
levels, in different ways.&nbsp;
So much of today's lecture

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.700
is context, for much of the,
for going across the 1940s

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.700
up to Brown v.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.700
Board.&nbsp; Now I ended the last
lecture before the midterm

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.700
talking about A.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.000
Philip Randolph's March
on Washington Movement,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.767
his bluff with FDR, FDR's
issuing of Executive Order

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:22.667
8802, and the creation of
the FEPC.&nbsp; I was trying to

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:25.100
cram a lot of things into
the lecture.&nbsp; Give me two

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.767
minutes to talk about the
FEPC very quickly and move

00:08:27.767 --> 00:08:31.667
us into the
1940s.&nbsp; The FEPC,

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:34.567
Fair Employment--Fair
Employment Practices

00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:36.700
Commission--Committee, held
high profile hearings in

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.400
major cities about
segregation in defense

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.200
industry factories.&nbsp; But it
was essentially powerless to

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.167
do anything except for
embarrass the companies and

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:51.200
the factories that are,
that are continuing these

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.567
practices.&nbsp; Now in terms
of, so literal change,

00:08:56.567 --> 00:09:01.000
the FEPC is not doing much,
as it turns out.&nbsp; But again,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.367
since we're
wrestling with--I,

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:04.767
I've been talking about the
tension between the symbolic

00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:09.367
and the real.&nbsp; At
the symbolic level,

00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:12.800
the FEPC contributes to the,
to blacks' reorientation

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.700
away from
notions of, you know,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.767
systems of white patronage.&nbsp;
They have to rely on white

00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:21.700
patrons to make ends meet,
but they could turn to the

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.900
federal government instead,
but the federal government,

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.800
and I started talking about
it with the Black Cabinet

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.267
through Marian Anderson's
concert on Easter Sunday,

00:09:30.267 --> 00:09:34.200
1939, the federal government
is now standing in,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.500
in complicated
ways, certainly,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.000
but still standing in
and keeping an eye on the

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
quality of
black life.&nbsp; Well,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.967
here we are in
1941 and 1942,

00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:45.967
the U.S.

00:09:45.967 --> 00:09:49.000
is now involved in the
Second World War.&nbsp; And as

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.900
you'll remember from going
back to the First World War,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.900
as, as the U.S.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.567
is about to get
involved and W.

00:09:54.567 --> 00:09:55.567
E.

00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:56.567
B.

00:09:56.567 --> 00:09:57.567
Du Bois called on African
Americans to close ranks,

00:09:57.567 --> 00:09:58.600
but then called on them to
return fighting.&nbsp; You have

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:02.400
black soldiers enlisting in
terrifically large numbers.&nbsp;

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.800
You have a lot of the same
kind of troubling dynamics

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.500
about training
black soldiers,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.100
their treatment abroad,
positive by foreign troops

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.667
and foreign citizens
and negative by U.S.

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:19.867
troops.&nbsp; And you have the
treatment coming home that

00:10:19.867 --> 00:10:25.900
is scandalous.&nbsp;
ThePittsburgh Courier,

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.900
along with the
Chicago Defender,

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.400
the two most important
black newspapers of the day,

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.867
the Pittsburgh Courier,
aware that the same dynamic

00:10:32.867 --> 00:10:34.900
might repeat
itself, that is,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.367
you know, black soldiers
fighting for citizenship

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:39.900
rights and
being denied them,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:45.100
in February of 1942 begins
a campaign.&nbsp; It's--It is a

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.100
publicity campaign;
it's nothing beyond that,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.500
but it becomes very
popular.&nbsp; It's the Double V

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.200
campaign, Double V, two Vs:
that there would be victory

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.300
over fascism abroad
and victory over racial

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.367
discrimination at home.&nbsp;
This is just like Du Bois's

00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:02.400
call, "We return.&nbsp; We return
from fighting.&nbsp; We return

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.300
fighting."&nbsp; Okay?&nbsp; But
twenty-three years have

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.967
passed.&nbsp; It's the same
call, it's the same agenda.&nbsp;

00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:18.700
That's the important thing
to understand.&nbsp; Now Randolph

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.200
bluffs FDR into signing
this executive order,

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.000
and Randolph realizes he
has an important opportunity

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.700
here to make something out
of this bluff and this March

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.867
on Washington Movement
becomes an organization,

00:11:29.867 --> 00:11:34.200
not just one person
trying to organize a march,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.200
but it actually becomes its
own grassroots organization,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.800
the MO--MOWM.&nbsp; There's no
easy way to say it.&nbsp; The

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:44.100
March on Washington Movement
embodies a certain set of

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.600
tactics and they are, for
lack of a better phrase,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.467
racial tactics.&nbsp; Randolph,
as you already know,

00:11:53.467 --> 00:11:58.700
was an anti-communist.&nbsp; He
was deeply concerned about

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.467
white communists
infiltrating the National

00:12:02.467 --> 00:12:05.000
Negro Congress and
when it happened,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.100
he broke from it.&nbsp; And
he saw that the March on

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.500
Washington Movement was
a way--by--he kept it

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.500
all-black.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.800
I should have said that
first.&nbsp; It was an all-black

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.067
movement.&nbsp; He saw by
keeping it all-black,

00:12:16.067 --> 00:12:18.200
it would reduce or even
eliminate the chance that

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.800
the Communist Party would
infiltrate the organization,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.900
since the Communist Party
was predominantly white.&nbsp;

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.800
But Randolph was very clear,
since we're in a time of

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.967
war, to go to great ends to
make sure his movement was

00:12:33.967 --> 00:12:37.267
not considered black
nationalist.&nbsp; Although it's

00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:41.567
all-black, it's not black
nationalist.&nbsp; And Randolph

00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:43.767
declares, and I'm quoting
here: "We condemn all

00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:47.167
dictatorships, Fascist,
Nazi and Communists.

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:50.567
We are loyal,
patriotic Americans all.

00:12:50.567 --> 00:12:52.567
But if American democracy
will not defend its

00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:55.267
defenders; if American
democracy will not protect

00:12:55.267 --> 00:12:58.300
its protectors; if American
democracy will not give job

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.200
to its--jobs to its toilers
because of race or color;

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.200
if American democracy will
not issue--insure equality

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.200
of opportunity, freedom
and justice to its citizens,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.367
black and white, it is a
hollow mockery and belies

00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:14.800
the principles for which
it is supposed to stand."

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.400
The March on Washington
Movement is all-black.&nbsp; It

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.100
certainly
welcomes white support,

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.667
but not within the
organization itself,

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:25.167
and it is profoundly
patriotic as far as its

00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:30.300
assertions--as far as its
assertions are concerned.&nbsp;

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.600
On the ground, the March on
Washington Movement engaged

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.500
in mass,
nonviolent, direct action,

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.200
a blend of Gandhi's tactics
and Randolph's experiences

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:44.400
with labor sit-down
strikes.&nbsp; He believed in

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.700
small direct
actions, you know,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.600
going into one
region or, you know,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.867
a part of the country with
small and highly symbolic

00:13:52.867 --> 00:13:56.267
acts of resistance.&nbsp;
You know it has,

00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:59.967
It's sort of a
hodgepodge of org--of,

00:13:59.967 --> 00:14:04.100
of, of , of groups
operating under its banner,

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.300
doing different things
in different places,

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.300
but all embracing
an all-black agenda,

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.700
an all-black constituency,
mass nonviolent,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:17.667
direct action.&nbsp; There's
another group that's founded

00:14:17.667 --> 00:14:19.767
in 1942, a year after
the March on Washington

00:14:19.767 --> 00:14:25.267
Movement, that embraced this
secular--that embraced a

00:14:25.267 --> 00:14:27.400
different agenda from
the March on Washington--a

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.000
different organizing
agenda, pardon me,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.367
from the March on
Washington Movement.&nbsp; It was

00:14:35.367 --> 00:14:38.900
interracial civil rights
organization called the

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.867
Congress on
Racial Equality, CORE,

00:14:40.867 --> 00:14:44.567
Congress on Racial Equality,
an off-shoot of the pacifist

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:46.567
Fellowship of
Reconciliation.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:52.400
CORE was founded in 1942.&nbsp;
Its director was James

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.067
Farmer, and one of the
principal organizers was a

00:14:54.067 --> 00:14:55.500
man, was a man
named Bayard Rustin,

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.200
someone we'll hear more
about in the next couple of

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.800
weeks.&nbsp; CORE and the March
on Washington Movement were

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.700
two of the main
groups operating in,

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.000
in the 1940s to educate
blacks to use nonviolent

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.200
direct action.&nbsp; So they
shared that strategic

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.600
logic.&nbsp; CORE
was interracial;

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:18.600
March on Washington Movement
was all-black.&nbsp; The March on

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.200
Washington Movement built
its base on the Brotherhood

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.800
of Sleeping Car
Porters and Maids Union,

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.600
using Randolph's
organizing skills,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.700
and really tried to reach
out to lower-class blacks as

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.900
well.&nbsp; CORE was
significantly smaller than

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.467
March on
Washington Movement,

00:15:41.467 --> 00:15:45.767
and it was focused on
essentially the demographic

00:15:45.767 --> 00:15:49.000
you represent:
college-aged student,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.100
highly
educated, interracial,

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:57.100
and essentially elitist.&nbsp;
CORE's mission statement

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.300
says that it has one
purpose: to eliminate racial

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.800
discrimination, and it
has one method: interracial

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800
nonviolent, direct
action.&nbsp; And of course,

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:10.900
style was to
test, to negotiate,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.067
to confer and then
to sit-in.&nbsp; Test,

00:16:14.067 --> 00:16:21.600
negotiate, confer, and
sit-in.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I'm going to

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.400
move away from these two
groups rather quickly,

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.500
but I wanted you to
understand these different

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:30.000
organizing logics, although
they're sharing the same

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.567
strategic mode of
engagement.&nbsp; Understand

00:16:32.567 --> 00:16:36.400
they're happening in
the 1940s as well,

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.167
because as I hope to make
clear through this lecture

00:16:39.167 --> 00:16:42.867
and through much of the next
couple of weeks' lectures,

00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:45.000
it's very critical you start
to re-periodize the civil

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.700
rights movement.&nbsp; The
kinds of things that I just

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.200
mentioned here, I hope that
you will recognize from your

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.800
basic high school
American History class,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.200
talking about the
civil rights movement,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.667
that famous movement
between '54 and '68,

00:16:59.667 --> 00:17:06.067
at the most, okay?&nbsp;
The strategies of,

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:09.067
of, of, sort of the high
theater of the civil rights

00:17:09.067 --> 00:17:13.300
movement roots go back
to the 1940s and beyond,

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.100
with direct
corrections and a,

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:16.767
a direct
lineage of, of sorts,

00:17:16.767 --> 00:17:18.367
of resistance.

00:17:18.367 --> 00:17:22.667
You need to understand this;
it's rather important.&nbsp; Now

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:25.100
what's happening in the
1940s?&nbsp; What's the scene in

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.267
which the March on
Washington Movement and CORE

00:17:27.267 --> 00:17:31.867
are operating?&nbsp; The country
is in transition.&nbsp; It's in

00:17:31.867 --> 00:17:34.500
war.&nbsp; As I
already mentioned,

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.300
the Great Migration
happening in the first two

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:39.567
decades of the twentieth
century.&nbsp; There's another

00:17:39.567 --> 00:17:42.300
migration happening now that
dwarfs the Great Migration,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.800
a migration of
African Americans,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.067
many of whom are following
defense industry jobs out

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:50.800
West and in the
North.&nbsp; Essentially,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.200
the black population you
know of in Los Angeles is

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.000
there because of, of defense
industry jobs and factory

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.367
jobs during this period of
time.&nbsp; This is the moment,

00:18:00.367 --> 00:18:02.967
over the next decade, when
African Americans move from

00:18:02.967 --> 00:18:06.400
being predominantly a rural
population--I think it's

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.300
about forty percent at
that point--to over fifty or

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.500
fifty-five percent urban.&nbsp;
So it's a transition,

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.967
profound transition,
for African Americans,

00:18:15.967 --> 00:18:19.500
as far as demographics are
concerned.&nbsp; Now with this

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.100
migration, like the
first Great Migration,

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:28.600
you have crisis,
pressure for housing,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:35.300
cultural styles, political
battlefields.&nbsp; 1943 is a

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.067
spectacular year for
crisis.&nbsp; You have race riots

00:18:39.067 --> 00:18:41.600
happening in the summer of
'43 in forty-seven different

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.567
cities.&nbsp; One of the most
famous is the Zoot Suit

00:18:44.567 --> 00:18:47.367
Riots in Los Angeles, which
involved not blacks in this

00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:49.800
case, but Mexicans,
and Mexican Americans,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:56.300
and white Navy--I think it's
Navy.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure it's

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.767
Navy--members of the Navy
attacking Los Angelinos who

00:19:00.767 --> 00:19:05.300
happened to be Mexican, for
straying across racial and

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.500
social lines.&nbsp; The worst
riot happens in Detroit,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.800
a mere ten days before a
March on Washington Movement

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.100
convention in
Chicago.&nbsp; The riot,

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.200
in all of its violence,
colored the March on

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.367
Washington Movement in
Chicago--convention in

00:19:25.367 --> 00:19:31.700
Chicago, and so militant
race leadership is seen as

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.867
too provocative and
un-American.&nbsp; And really,

00:19:37.867 --> 00:19:39.800
people can deny the fact
that blacks actually were

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.200
beginning to get jobs
in these factories,

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:50.367
because factories were so
desperate for workers.&nbsp; You

00:19:50.367 --> 00:19:53.500
have migration,
racial violence,

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.100
a country at war, the
March on Washington Movement

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.667
agitating, making some
headway as far as its

00:19:58.667 --> 00:20:01.600
long-term goals, but also
having a narrower range in

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.100
which it could
operate, because,

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:07.367
you know, appearing
un-American is the last

00:20:07.367 --> 00:20:08.900
thing you want to do at
this moment in time.&nbsp; It's

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.200
something that Randolph
himself articulates.&nbsp;

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.767
Meanwhile, membership
in the NAACP skyrockets,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.500
as the
organiza--organization

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.067
appears to be a more
moderate and reasonable

00:20:23.067 --> 00:20:27.600
location for civil rights
agitation than the all-black

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.300
March on
Washington Movement,

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.567
even though it's making,
it's a pro-American stance,

00:20:33.567 --> 00:20:39.300
and more moderate than this
upstart CORE that people

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.800
don't really know what to
make of yet.&nbsp; So you have

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:47.867
now, by the mid-1940s,
the NAACP becoming,

00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:50.667
turning into this
moderate organization,

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.400
by outward appearances,
where it was on the edge,

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.500
sort of the avant
garde, when it was founded,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.600
and for the first
decade, decade,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.900
two decades of its
existence.&nbsp; Things are

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:06.000
shifting.&nbsp; Things shift
fundamentally in 1944 in a

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.200
legal case, Smith v.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:11.500
Allwright, that
outlaws the white,

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.600
outlaws the white-only
primary.&nbsp; And I have to

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.967
apologize.&nbsp; I have to go
really quickly through a lot

00:21:17.967 --> 00:21:21.300
of these things, because
I lost a lecture by the

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.900
midterm, so I'm not going to
get into the details.&nbsp; But

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:25.900
in the Smith v.

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:29.167
Allwrightcase, the
white, white primaries,

00:21:29.167 --> 00:21:32.100
white primaries
are now outlawed,

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.500
and now liberal
groups, broadly defined,

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.100
start going after a whole
set of different means of

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.867
exclusion, of preserving,
essentially an all-white

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:46.900
vote.&nbsp; Groups start going
after literacy tests that

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.500
were, that were at
the point of absurdity,

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.800
where a registrar could
actually ask somebody,

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.800
"How many bubbles are
there in a bar of soap?"

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.600
as a way to exclude them.&nbsp;
People knew they had to act

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.100
in terms of trying to
expand the right to vote,

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.100
or access to the
ballot box, ballot box,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.667
by just looking at
Mississippi.&nbsp; In

00:22:08.667 --> 00:22:12.100
Mississippi, you have
over three hundred and fifty

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.967
thousand blacks who are
eligible to register,

00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:17.200
register to vote.&nbsp;
Mississippi has a huge black

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.300
population.&nbsp; And of that
three hundred and fifty

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.700
thousand, only twenty-five
hundred manage to vote in

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.100
1946.&nbsp; It's an
all-white vote,

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.500
because of all the various
ways in which Mississippi

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.767
registrars and voters are
being told to eliminate the

00:22:35.767 --> 00:22:36.900
black vote.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.167
In fact, very famously,
Senator Bilbo from,

00:22:39.167 --> 00:22:42.000
from Mississippi, who
was a virulent racist,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.700
would go around organizing
registrars of voters

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.300
of--before actual
election night,

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.200
telling them all these
different ways in which you

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.567
can eliminate
the black vote,

00:22:55.567 --> 00:22:57.900
and said, you know, "If
worst comes to worst,

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.167
you all know the most
effective strategy is the

00:23:00.167 --> 00:23:02.967
night before the election,
and you know what I mean,

00:23:02.967 --> 00:23:05.667
 I mean essentially calling
for them to rally the Klan

00:23:05.667 --> 00:23:12.467
to eliminate
black vote.&nbsp; Again,

00:23:12.467 --> 00:23:15.900
the country's in--under
incredible stress because of

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:21.900
these transitions going on.&nbsp;
Between '46 and '48 at the

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.700
presidential level, some
more radical changes are

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.200
happening.&nbsp; FDR had died in
office already.&nbsp; Now Harry

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.467
Truman is the President,
and he's fighting for his

00:23:31.467 --> 00:23:34.700
political life.&nbsp; The
Democratic Party's on the

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.500
verge of being split.&nbsp;
Recognizing that there's

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.400
incredible dissension
amongst the Democratic

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.400
ranks, Southern Democrats
are very unhappy with the

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.600
trends in what's
happening in the country,

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.100
supported by the
federal government,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:54.700
that entity that blacks saw
as a place of salvation.&nbsp;

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:55.767
Truman doesn't
know what to do,

00:23:55.767 --> 00:23:59.000
and so he actually lets--he
sort of throws a bone to his

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.700
antagonists in the
Democratic Party and lets

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.000
Congress kill the FEPC.&nbsp;
So now there's no more

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.200
publicity campaign
machine to sort of embarrass

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.267
factories into employing
African Americans and

00:24:11.267 --> 00:24:13.000
practicing
non-discrimination

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.767
policies.&nbsp; Truman lets
Congress kill the FEPC but

00:24:16.767 --> 00:24:20.167
knows he needs the black
vote to win election.&nbsp; It

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:23.900
was clear when FDR
got elected in 1944,

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.000
it was clear that the black
vote is what brought him,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.367
got him into office, and
Truman can't lose it.&nbsp; So

00:24:30.367 --> 00:24:35.767
Truman raises the stakes,
after killing the FEPC,

00:24:35.767 --> 00:24:37.767
and appoints a distinguished
panel to serve as the

00:24:37.767 --> 00:24:40.000
President's
Commission on Civil Rights,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.100
which would recommend over
time more adequate means and

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.900
procedures for the
protection of civil rights

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.900
for U.S.

00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.067
citizens.

00:24:50.067 --> 00:24:51.967
In October '47
it issues its,

00:24:51.967 --> 00:24:55.067
its report, called "To
Secure These Rights,

00:24:55.067 --> 00:25:00.767
 a landmark document.&nbsp; "To
Secure These Rights" defined

00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:02.800
the nation's civil
rights agenda for the next

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.800
generation.&nbsp; The commission
noted the many restrictions

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.067
on blacks and urged
that each person,

00:25:08.067 --> 00:25:10.100
regardless of race,
color, or national origin,

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.700
should have access to equal
opportunity in securing

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.600
education, decent housing,
and jobs.&nbsp; Among its

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.400
proposals, the commission
suggested anti-lynching and

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:23.600
anti-poll tax laws,
a permanent FEPC,

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.800
and
strengthen--strengthening

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.800
the Civil Rights Division of
the Department of Justice.&nbsp;

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.200
The commission went
much further than Southern

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.400
Democrats ever imagined
they would dare to go,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.967
further than Truman thought
they would actually go.&nbsp; But

00:25:39.967 --> 00:25:41.900
he called this commission
together and so he had to

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:48.900
face a choice, what to
do.&nbsp; So in February of 1948,

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:52.900
Truman rolls the dice and
calls for the implementation

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.400
of the Commission's
recommendations.&nbsp;

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.367
Southerners immediately
threaten a filibuster and

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:04.067
Truman, unable to secure
support from Congress or

00:26:04.067 --> 00:26:06.800
action from Congress,
moves ahead using executive

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.000
authority.&nbsp; And
among other things,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.067
he bolsters the Civil Rights
Division at the Department

00:26:11.067 --> 00:26:13.300
of Justice, appoints the
first black judge to the

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:16.200
federal bench, names several
other blacks to high-ranking

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.700
administrative positions,
and most important,

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.400
on July 26th of 1948, he
issued the executive order

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.167
abolishing segregation in
the armed forces and ordered

00:26:25.167 --> 00:26:29.000
full integration of all
the services.&nbsp; The executive

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.400
orders that grow out of this
array of changes are 9980,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.867
nine-nine-eight-zero,
establishing fair employment

00:26:35.867 --> 00:26:38.400
practices in the
federal government,

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.767
and the next
one immediately,

00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:40.967
so you can see
he's going on a tear,

00:26:40.967 --> 00:26:45.200
Executive Order 9981
establishes the President's

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.300
Committee on Equality of
Treatment and Opportunity in

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.900
the Armed Forces, the
decree that leads to the

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.267
desegregation order to
the military.&nbsp; Now it's the

00:26:54.267 --> 00:26:57.467
order.&nbsp; The military
takes its sweet old time

00:26:57.467 --> 00:27:03.100
desegregating, but the
order's issued in 1948,

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:07.067
growing out of
this--Truman's political

00:27:07.067 --> 00:27:10.967
move to sort of clarify
the mess of the Democratic

00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:13.867
Party, make it known to
African Americans that he

00:27:13.867 --> 00:27:15.700
was going to support them,
the Democratic Party would

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.467
support them.&nbsp; But was it
enough?&nbsp; Henry Wallace,

00:27:20.467 --> 00:27:22.600
who had been a former
Vice President of FDR,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:28.067
before he got booted, very
progressive and challenges

00:27:28.067 --> 00:27:30.067
Truman from the left.

00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:35.767
The real challenge
comes from the right,

00:27:35.767 --> 00:27:39.567
within the Democratic Party,
let me be clear.&nbsp; Truman's

00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:41.567
support for a strong civil
rights platform for the

00:27:41.567 --> 00:27:43.967
Democratic, Democratic
convention that was coming

00:27:43.967 --> 00:27:51.000
up is opposed by
conservative Democrats.&nbsp; And

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.300
they say, "If you bring this
platform to the convention

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:58.300
floor, we will leave."&nbsp;
Truman brought the platform

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:04.067
to the convention floor and
conservative Democrats from

00:28:04.067 --> 00:28:11.500
Southern states bolt and
form what is popularly known

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.067
as the Dixiecrat Party,
with Strom Thurmond as its

00:28:14.067 --> 00:28:20.600
presidential candidate.&nbsp; The
Democratic Party is split

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.600
and it's quite unclear
what's going to happen.&nbsp;

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.600
Now, what happens is that
Truman wins by a hair's

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.900
breath, and again,
without black support,

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.200
he never would have been
elected to a full term as

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.100
President.&nbsp; Now that's
what's happening on sort of

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:45.467
the high political stage
throughout the 1940s.&nbsp; Let

00:28:45.467 --> 00:28:49.700
me quickly canvass
what's happening,

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.800
it's still
politics of course,

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:54.400
but in the legal
arena, over this period,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.800
to help you understand
another element of this,

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.467
of this shift that's
happening in the country on

00:28:59.467 --> 00:29:03.367
these issues.&nbsp; And what I
want to give you is the

00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:04.367
legal history of Brown v.

00:29:04.367 --> 00:29:06.800
Board of Education.&nbsp; That's
where this is heading up

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:14.500
to.&nbsp; The legal history
begins at Howard University

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.900
Law School.&nbsp; I already
mentioned before the

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.767
National--the New
Negro Alliance,

00:29:18.767 --> 00:29:23.600
excuse me, formed in
1933, relied upon law school

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.467
students and law professors
at Howard University Law

00:29:26.467 --> 00:29:29.000
School to argue its case
that eventually becomes a

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.300
Supreme Court decision in
1930--I forgot my notes.&nbsp;

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:36.800
I'll just guess '37, I'm
blanking right now.&nbsp; But the

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:42.800
battle begins at Howard
University Law School.&nbsp;

00:29:48.767 --> 00:29:51.167
Excuse me, I've lost
track for a second.

00:29:51.167 --> 00:29:55.900
There we go.&nbsp;
Charles Houston,

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.300
the attorney who also
spearheads its citizens

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.300
campaign for Marian
Anderson's concert,

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.067
he's brought in to head
up the law school in the

00:30:08.067 --> 00:30:12.300
late-1920s, to bring it up
to fully accredited status.&nbsp;

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:17.600
He starts hiring professors
of law.&nbsp; Some of the great

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.200
legal jurists of the next
twenty and thirty years,

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.500
forty years would actually
start at Howard University

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.000
Law School as professors,
and they would train that

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.800
first cadre of civil
rights attorneys.&nbsp; In fact,

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.800
the first civil rights law
class in the country was

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.867
taught at Howard during this
period.&nbsp; The most famous

00:30:34.867 --> 00:30:36.600
student during
the period, this,

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.600
this early-1930s, is
Thurgood Marshall.&nbsp; Thurgood

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.367
Marshall, a
native of Maryland,

00:30:41.367 --> 00:30:43.300
wanted to go to the
University of Maryland

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.900
School of Law,
but by practice,

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.567
blacks were not admitted, so
he had to go to--he ended up

00:30:49.567 --> 00:30:53.400
going to Howard University.&nbsp;
And at that very small law

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.167
school with some
very intense faculty,

00:30:55.167 --> 00:30:58.500
he goes through sort of a
boot camp for several years,

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:02.200
and comes out with the
kind of legalized training,

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:07.300
with special attention
to civil rights cases.&nbsp;

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.700
Marshall scores his first
major court victory along

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:15.200
these lines in 1935, in a
case called Murray versus

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.500
Pearson.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.100
In this case, a guy
named Donald Murray was not

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.300
allowed to enter the
University of Maryland

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.967
because he was
black.&nbsp; Raymond Pearson,

00:31:25.967 --> 00:31:27.500
the president of the
University of Maryland--so

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:29.300
it's the student versus the
president as far as naming

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:32.700
conventions, Murray versus
Pearson--said that Murray

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.700
could obtain separate
but equal training at the

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.900
Princess Anne Academy, also
in the state of Maryland.&nbsp;

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.167
However, the Princess
Anne Academy did not offer a

00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:45.167
legal degree, which is what
Murray was actually trying

00:31:45.167 --> 00:31:47.167
to obtain.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.900
Making a long story short,
Marshall and his mentor,

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.667
now increasingly
colleague, Charles Houston,

00:31:57.667 --> 00:32:02.900
who's now the head of the
Legal Defense Fund at NAACP,

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:07.700
argue the case up to the
Supreme Court.&nbsp; And the

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.767
court declares that the
University of Maryland,

00:32:11.767 --> 00:32:14.800
because it did not have a
separate and equal facility

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:21.167
for teaching law, had
to let Murray in.&nbsp; Okay,

00:32:21.167 --> 00:32:27.967
that's 1935.&nbsp; Based on
the success of that case,

00:32:27.967 --> 00:32:32.367
Houston brings Marshall over
to the NAACP and they start

00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:35.200
traveling from southern
courthouse to southern

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.700
courthouse to
southern courthouse,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.400
filing law--lawsuits
for black students and

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:46.700
teachers.&nbsp; In 1938, in
the case--these are Supreme

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.867
Court cases by
the way--Gaines v.

00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:55.900
Canada.&nbsp; Lloyd Gaines is the
plaintiff and Canada--who

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.867
is, I'm missing
the first name here.

00:32:58.867 --> 00:33:00.567
It's the last name of the
registrar of the University

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:03.000
of Missouri.&nbsp; So the
case is called Gaines v.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.267
Canada.&nbsp; It's a student
versus the registrar of the

00:33:06.267 --> 00:33:10.600
University of Missouri.&nbsp;
The University of Missouri

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.367
refused to
admit Lloyd Gaines,

00:33:12.367 --> 00:33:17.600
African American, to its law
school because the school

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:22.467
was only for whites.&nbsp; It was
common in Missouri for the

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:26.667
state to send black students
to neighboring states for

00:33:26.667 --> 00:33:29.667
courses of study not
offered by Missouri's black

00:33:29.667 --> 00:33:33.600
schools.&nbsp; Since Missouri
did not have a separate but

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:39.100
equal law school for blacks,
the Supreme Court declares

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.700
that Gaines had to be
allowed to attend the

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:48.900
University of Missouri
Law School.&nbsp; So you have in

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.900
Murray v.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:54.100
Pearson, there's no separate
institution offering a law

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:56.500
degree in Maryland,
so you have to let,

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:01.900
admit Murray into the
school of law.&nbsp; In Gaines v.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.900
Canada,
University of Missouri,

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.300
the idea of shipping a
student out of state--which

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.367
was not just a Missouri
practice by the way.&nbsp; A lot

00:34:11.367 --> 00:34:15.667
of southern students--states
did this--was ruled

00:34:15.667 --> 00:34:19.200
unconstitutional.&nbsp; The state
had to provide state-funded

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.900
separate but equal
legal facility.&nbsp; Now,

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.067
I mean, one
might ask, why's,

00:34:24.067 --> 00:34:26.300
why would a state
even, you know,

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.200
provide these fellowships,
scholarships to get the

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.200
students educated in law
school if not in their own

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.167
state?&nbsp; The thinking was,
you got them out of the

00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:38.800
state, they would stay out
of the state.&nbsp; So the South

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.100
was trying to
export black legal,

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:46.067
potential legal talent to
northern places mainly.&nbsp; To

00:34:46.067 --> 00:34:48.300
get that "problem"
out of their state,

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.300
they'd pay for them to
leave.&nbsp; The Supreme Court

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.300
says, "Can't do
it."&nbsp; That's 1938,

00:34:55.300 --> 00:35:02.000
if I didn't mention that.&nbsp;
Houston and Marshall keep

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.400
plugging away,
filing the lawsuits,

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:08.300
poking at the
system.&nbsp; In 1946,

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:17.400
they take on the case of a
woman named Ada Sipuel.&nbsp; In

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.900
'46, Sipuel had applied to
the University of Oklahoma

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:27.867
Law School and was denied
because of race.&nbsp; And in

00:35:27.867 --> 00:35:32.767
1948, the Supreme Court
finally rules that Oklahoma

00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:35.500
had to provide instruction
for blacks equal to that of

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:41.100
whites.&nbsp; So this is now--not
following--they're not

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.300
breaking new ground
here.&nbsp; They're following a

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:46.467
precedent that was
there in the Donald v.

00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:51.000
Murray, bounded by Gaines v.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.067
Canada, say you can't ship
her out some place else.&nbsp; So

00:35:54.067 --> 00:35:58.367
Oklahoma says, "All right,
well we're going to comply.&nbsp;

00:35:58.367 --> 00:36:00.567
We're not going to admit
her to our law school,

00:36:00.567 --> 00:36:03.167
to the white law school.&nbsp;
We'll build a law school for

00:36:03.167 --> 00:36:09.000
her."&nbsp; And so in a few
months' time the state of

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.100
Oklahoma creates the
Langston University School

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.400
of Law, located at
the state capital,

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.400
thus requiring further
litigation to demonstrate

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.500
that the law school was
inferior to the University

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.400
of Oklahoma's law
school.&nbsp; I mean,

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.700
the lawyers
were, were claiming,

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.900
"You cannot build a law
school in a few months,

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.300
 and it really was just
done in a few months,

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.200
"designed to educate blacks
in the state and suggest

00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.300
that it's even near equal
to what the University of

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:41.900
Oklahoma's already
established law school

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.600
provides."&nbsp; They
don't have the resources,

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.300
they don't have the access,
they don't have the training

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.300
available to them.&nbsp; So
further litigation ensues

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.400
and in 1949, Oklahoma,
the University of Oklahoma

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:58.967
decides to admit Sipuel,
thus breaking the color line

00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.967
for the School of Law there.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.300
Sipuel becomes not just
the first black woman,

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.400
or black, to integrate
in the University of

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.667
Oklahom--Oklahoma
Law School,

00:37:08.667 --> 00:37:11.400
she's the first black woman
to attend an all-white law

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:19.067
school in the entire South.&nbsp;
The law school admits here

00:37:19.067 --> 00:37:21.800
and gives her a
special chair.&nbsp; That's nice,

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.900
it seems, right?&nbsp; Well, the
chair is marked "colored"

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:28.100
and it's roped off from the
rest of the class.&nbsp; She's in

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.700
the same classroom but in a
roped off section of one.&nbsp;

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.367
Now as it happens, her
classmates and teachers

00:37:37.367 --> 00:37:39.867
actually welcome her
into the classroom.&nbsp; The

00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:42.200
resistance is coming
from someplace else,

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:46.567
institutionally or
governmentally.&nbsp; Stories

00:37:46.567 --> 00:37:48.100
abound, and
Sipuel is--would,

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:50.967
would support this, that
students shared their notes

00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:54.500
with her, studied with
her, helped her catch up on

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.100
material if she happened to
miss some of it.&nbsp; Sipuel had

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.800
to eat in a
separate section of the,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.200
of a separate and chained
off and guarded section in

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.800
the law school cafeteria,
and white students would

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.800
crawl under the chain and
eat with her when the guards

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:15.500
weren't around.&nbsp; Her
law student tuition are

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.300
supported by hundreds
of small donations and,

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:21.700
she would recount later, she
believed she owed it to all

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:25.700
those who supported her that
she had to ser--that she had

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:30.400
to make it.&nbsp; Now actually,
if you look up on the

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.867
website, and I imagine one
or two might do it right

00:38:32.867 --> 00:38:34.800
now, even though
I hope you don't,

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.667
the University of
Oklahom--Oklahoma Law School

00:38:36.667 --> 00:38:39.400
is named for Ada Sipuel now.

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.300
This is also a generational
change of another kind of

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.600
order.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.600
In any event, the important
thing about all these

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.667
different cases, these three
sort of landmark cases,

00:38:48.667 --> 00:38:52.100
they shared some things in
common.&nbsp; They're all about

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:55.900
law schools.&nbsp; They're
all about law schools.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:39:00.267
Marshall and Houston
believed that they had to

00:39:00.267 --> 00:39:03.367
find test cases that would
create the greatest chance

00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:07.200
of sympathy from judges
and eventually Supreme Court

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.567
justices.

00:39:08.567 --> 00:39:11.800
And so they thought by
bringing to their attention,

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.900
to the judges' attention,
people who wanted to be like

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.367
them, study the law, and
people who--and this is

00:39:18.367 --> 00:39:20.667
important, and I'll speak
more about it on Monday--who

00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:23.667
were astonishingly good
students.&nbsp; They had to be

00:39:23.667 --> 00:39:25.500
perfect students.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.000
By bringing incredible
students in front of them

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.767
who are trying to
become lawyers,

00:39:30.767 --> 00:39:31.800
these judges
might be, you know,

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.500
have thought, "Well,
gosh, this really is a silly

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.867
system.&nbsp; We need to
find some other way,

00:39:34.867 --> 00:39:36.867
other way around it."&nbsp; So
that's one part about it.&nbsp;

00:39:36.867 --> 00:39:38.700
It's just about, it's
just about access to law

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:44.467
schools.&nbsp; Now
what it's also,

00:39:44.467 --> 00:39:46.500
and probably even
more important--not even

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.700
probably--definitely more
important about these law

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.967
school, these cases,
these legal cases,

00:39:50.967 --> 00:39:52.867
is that none of them
challenged Plessy v.

00:39:52.867 --> 00:39:56.167
Ferguson.&nbsp; All of them are
articulated upon the grounds

00:39:56.167 --> 00:39:58.000
of, there is no
separate but equal,

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.967
equal institution for these
black plaintiffs to attend.&nbsp;

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.300
In Maryland, in
Missouri, in Oklahoma,

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.367
in each of those cases,
they're saying there's no

00:40:10.367 --> 00:40:13.300
separate but equal
institution.&nbsp; Oklahoma tried

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.700
making one.&nbsp; It wasn't equal
enough.&nbsp; It was separate but

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:23.100
not equal.&nbsp; So these--this
is a nice and slow and

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.467
gentle, I mean
according to them,

00:40:25.467 --> 00:40:28.167
approach to try to break
down segregation in higher

00:40:28.167 --> 00:40:31.600
education.&nbsp; Based on the
success they're meeting with

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.267
the law schools, they
start going after graduate

00:40:33.267 --> 00:40:37.300
schools.&nbsp; So professional
schools into graduate

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:42.300
schools, and then
they start--I mean,

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.000
and basically the writing is
now on the wall.&nbsp; People see

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.600
this.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.600
They realize the trajectory
of these attorneys is

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.567
heading sort of
downward in a sense,

00:40:52.567 --> 00:40:55.800
hierarchically, and the next
battlefield is going to be

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:59.800
secondary and primary
schools.&nbsp; Southern states

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.000
recognize this and
feverishly start trying to

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.267
improve black schools, which
were horrible.&nbsp; I mean the,

00:41:07.267 --> 00:41:09.767
the statistics are kind of
shocking about how poorly

00:41:09.767 --> 00:41:11.400
funded these
schools were, you know,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:17.500
only used textbooks, no
transportation.&nbsp; Southern

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.667
states try--start
trying pouring,

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:20.900
pouring money
into these schools,

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.800
trying to improve them, so
they could actually survive

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.800
a test of separate but
equal.&nbsp; But they're so bad,

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:32.500
they can't catch
up.&nbsp; So the attorneys,

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:36.900
NAACP attorneys, start
focusing now on elementary

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.167
and secondary schools
and challenging the very

00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:42.867
principle of segregation in
education--that seg--that

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:48.867
segregation on racial lines
was unconstitutional.&nbsp; They,

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.900
as they're going around
setting up these test cases,

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.200
there are five cases all
happening at the same time

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.000
that rise to the
Supreme Court's attention,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.500
and the Supreme--Supreme
Court bundles them

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.000
together.&nbsp; There are
cases in South Carolina,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.667
Virginia, Kansas, Delaware,
and the District of

00:42:07.667 --> 00:42:15.300
Columbia.&nbsp; They bundle
them together under Brown,

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.667
the father of two girls
integrating--trying to

00:42:17.667 --> 00:42:21.800
integrate schools in Topeka,
Kansas.&nbsp; But that's--this is

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.100
one case representing many
other cases.&nbsp; The attorney

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:30.467
general of the United States
actually calls for the end

00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:33.900
of segregation, but the
reasoning is revealing.&nbsp; He

00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:36.700
wrote that, "Racial
discrimination furnishes

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.500
grist for the Communist
propaganda mills and it

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.767
raises doubt even among
friendly nations as to the

00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:45.300
intensity of our devotion
to the Democratic faith."

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.600
He's not
talking about, "Hey,

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.667
we need to educate our
citizens."&nbsp; It's like,

00:42:48.667 --> 00:42:51.800
"This looks bad on the
international scene.&nbsp; It's

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.467
embarrassing and it's, it's
affecting negatively our

00:42:55.467 --> 00:43:01.200
potential to make change
around the world."&nbsp; Cutting

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:07.000
to the chase, Brown versus
the Board of Education makes

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.867
it to the Supreme Court, and
the ruling is offered in May

00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:18.567
of 1954.&nbsp; Earl Warren,
the very new Chief Justice,

00:43:18.567 --> 00:43:21.400
writes the opinion for a
unanimous court that says,

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.000
"The separate educational
facilities is in--inherently

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.700
unequal.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.400
Therefore, we hold that
the plaintiffs and others

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:29.867
similarly situated for
whom the actions have been

00:43:29.867 --> 00:43:33.667
brought up (brought, I mean,
this is the bundling) are,

00:43:33.667 --> 00:43:35.700
by reason of the
segregation complained of,

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.000
deprived of the equal
protection of the laws

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.900
guaranteed by the
Fourteenth Amendment."

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.100
Separation of the races
and facilities is inherently

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.700
unequal, based on equal
protection clause in the

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.600
Fourteenth Amendment.&nbsp;
Now, very quickly,

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.000
a few words about Earl
Warren himself because it's

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.500
actually fascinating.&nbsp;
He's a--while the,

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.300
while these cases are
being bundled and brought up

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:01.667
through the, the system,
he's not the Chief Justice.&nbsp;

00:44:01.667 --> 00:44:03.200
He's appointed that
position--He's not even on

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:05.267
the Supreme Court.&nbsp; He's
appointed to that position

00:44:05.267 --> 00:44:06.800
after the Chief
Justice, Fred Vinson,

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:11.467
dies.&nbsp; Someone,
jurists, legal,

00:44:11.467 --> 00:44:13.200
legal historians think it
was probably going to go

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:18.067
against Brown.&nbsp; Eisenhower,
now the President of the

00:44:18.067 --> 00:44:21.767
United States, appoints
what others thought a mere

00:44:21.767 --> 00:44:24.967
politician to
the Supreme Court,

00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:26.867
thus angering other
associate justices who

00:44:26.867 --> 00:44:30.267
thought they were going to
be the next Chief Justice.&nbsp;

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:32.367
And Warren would actually
go on to become a great

00:44:32.367 --> 00:44:38.167
mediator on the court, using
his political skills.&nbsp; And

00:44:38.167 --> 00:44:43.200
becomes on-- becomes a
great civil rights jurist,

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.367
someone Eisenhower would
call "the greatest mistake

00:44:45.367 --> 00:44:48.867
of his presidency,"
appointing Warren to the

00:44:48.867 --> 00:44:52.767
Supreme Court.&nbsp; Now Warren
himself did not have a

00:44:52.767 --> 00:44:55.600
sterling civil
liberties record.&nbsp; In fact,

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.000
it was pretty horrible.&nbsp;
When he was the attorney

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
general of
California in 1942,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.100
he led the move to detain
and then inter Japanese

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:09.500
Americans.&nbsp; And as he told
a conference of his fellow

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.600
governors in 1943, his
first year as governor of

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.767
California,"If the
Japs are released,

00:45:14.767 --> 00:45:17.100
no one will be able to tell
the saboteur from any other

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:19.900
Jap.&nbsp; We're now producing
approximately half of the

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:21.700
ships and airplanes of
the country on the Pacific

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:25.100
Coast.&nbsp; To cripple these
industries or the facilities

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:28.367
that serve them would be a
bloody--a body blow to the

00:45:28.367 --> 00:45:30.567
war effort.&nbsp; We don't
want to have a second Pearl

00:45:30.567 --> 00:45:33.000
Harbor in California.&nbsp; We
don't propose to have the

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.600
Japs back in California
during this war if there is

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.800
any lawful means
of preventing it."

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:40.967
This is one of the
great civil rights justices

00:45:40.967 --> 00:45:43.300
speaking before he was
elevated to that position.&nbsp;

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:47.300
So people doing some
basic psychoanalysis,

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.667
armchair psychoanalysis,
saying Warren is trying--I

00:45:49.667 --> 00:45:52.900
mean is horrified in
retrospect over what he did

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:56.967
in a moment of war, what he
felt was right at the time,

00:45:56.967 --> 00:46:00.000
to deny citizenship
rights to so many people,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.467
and was trying to
sort of cleanse himself.

00:46:03.467 --> 00:46:05.300
Now there's much more to
be said about Brown v.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.300
Board of Education, the
legal court case.&nbsp; But this

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:11.300
part is important to know,
in the sense that Warren

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:15.200
comes in out of the blue.

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:18.000
It probably changes the
future of the decision.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.100
The, the--If you look at
justices' opinions leading

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.800
up to Brown, it seemed at
best there might be a split

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.300
in the court,
if not a denial,

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:28.600
but Warren said, "No, we
are going to be active,

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.700
essentially, and it
must be unanimous,

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:33.300
 and he basically browbeat
the associate justices to

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:38.100
line up behind him to offer
this ruling.&nbsp; A watershed

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.900
moment, thus
closing the door on the

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:44.100
constitutionality of
separate but equal,

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:46.600
articulated in Plessy v.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:52.900
Ferguson at the end of the
nineteenth century.&nbsp; Now the

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:56.200
Supreme Court says that
this is unconstitutional,

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.667
segregation in,
in, in education,

00:46:58.667 --> 00:47:02.567
but how are you going to
change it?&nbsp; This is probably

00:47:02.567 --> 00:47:06.867
one of the most--This may be
the most cruel but important

00:47:06.867 --> 00:47:07.867
part of Brown v.

00:47:07.867 --> 00:47:12.767
Board of Education, is that
it's remanded back to local

00:47:12.767 --> 00:47:15.500
districts to figure out
the best play--best way to

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:22.000
desegregate the
schools.&nbsp; South Carolina,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.100
Georgia, Mississippi
governors threaten to

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:28.200
abolish public schools as a
result.&nbsp; "We'll just close

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.567
all the damn
public schools,

00:47:29.567 --> 00:47:32.100
 because the Supreme Court
is only talking about public

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:37.067
places of accommodation.&nbsp;
A year after Brown is

00:47:37.067 --> 00:47:39.400
articulated, it comes back
with what people call Brown

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:45.900
II, when the Supreme Court
sends these cases back to

00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.600
the local, local--sends the
cases back to the courts of

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.000
origins and in
deference to local customs,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.200
and familiarity, says that
these things should proceed

00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.100
with "all deliberate
speed."&nbsp; One of these

00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.400
wonderfully vague,
damningly vague,

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.067
Supreme Court edicts.&nbsp;
All deliberate speed.&nbsp;Many

00:48:03.067 --> 00:48:09.000
people thought, "like really
quickly!"&nbsp; Other people

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.100
thought, "Let's deliberate
for a long time."&nbsp; Speed,

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:18.000
after all, is really quite
relative.&nbsp; There are many

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.967
other immediate
ramifications or responses

00:48:20.967 --> 00:48:21.967
to Brown v.

00:48:21.967 --> 00:48:25.467
Board and its ruling in 1954
and '55.&nbsp; You--We began the

00:48:25.467 --> 00:48:27.200
lecture with one
of them, with Anna,

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.900
excuse me, Melba Beals as
a young girl about to be

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:35.267
raped, because the Supreme
Court had enraged this white

00:48:35.267 --> 00:48:39.400
father, that it was going
to change the way the world

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.300
looked for him.&nbsp; We'll talk
more about other ways of

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.367
resistance and high
political theater and Gothic

00:48:47.367 --> 00:48:49.100
violence in the
wake of Brown v.

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:52.100
Board when we pick up
on Monday.&nbsp; Thank you.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.640
Prof: Before we begin,
I have to make a true

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.000
confession to you,
my class, because you're my

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.372
class, and I have been
confessing things all semester

00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:15.033
but this is--
I basically set myself up for

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:18.028
this failure and then realized--
at the end of the class someone

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:19.510
came up to me and asked me a
question,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.850
and then I realized--Gaa! Okay.
 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.345
So remember how I told you how
at UVA for five straight years I

00:00:25.345 --> 00:00:28.559
forgot Thomas Jefferson's
birthday, even though everything

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:29.180
closed?
 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.490
Yeah.
 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.730
Guess what I didn't say on
Tuesday?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.860
I forgot it was Thomas
Jefferson's birthday.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.340
[laughter] I completely forgot.
 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.760
Someone came up at the end and
said,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.165
"Well, in honor of
Jefferson's birthday we did the

00:00:40.165 --> 00:00:42.260
following"--
and I was like [laughs].

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.666
So it's good to know that I'm
really consistently a horrible

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:48.206
UVA grad [laughter]
who always forgets Thomas

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:49.650
Jefferson's birthday.
 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.465
It must be a Hamiltonian mental
block [laughter]

00:00:52.465 --> 00:00:56.360
that I--it is not possible for
me to keep that date in my head.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.666
Anyway, I at least wanted to
say, happy birthday,

00:00:58.666 --> 00:00:59.580
Thomas Jefferson.
 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.609
So now, officially,
I'm a little late,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.912
but he'll get over it--so
anyway [laughter]

00:01:03.912 --> 00:01:05.340
I've confessed to you.
 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.150
I feel much better now.
 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.230
Okay.
 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.750
So today we turn to the
Constitution.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.601
In the last few lectures and in
today's lecture basically we've

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:22.610
been looking at the new nation
figure out its shape and form,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.069
right?--what kind of a nation
is this going to be.

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.420
As people were discovering
throughout the 1780s,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.269
it was one thing to protest
against things that you didn't

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:36.281
like in a government,
as the Americans had during the

00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:36.819
Revolution.
 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:40.635
It was quite another thing to
come up with an alternative,

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:44.450
to come up with something
better and then to get others to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.120
agree.
 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.919
Today's lecture,
I'm sorry--Tuesday's lecture

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:51.672
discussed part of this process
of figuring out the shape and

00:01:51.672 --> 00:01:53.390
form of the new nation.
 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.750
So we looked at the Mount
Vernon Conference,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.120
we looked at the Annapolis
Convention,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.216
and we--in doing that,
we're looking at a gradual

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:06.656
process that was unfolding one
step at a time with no

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:08.620
inevitable outcome.
 

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.982
So basically,
what we saw on Tuesday was how

00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:16.283
the Americans were basically
backing their way into what

00:02:16.283 --> 00:02:19.960
would become the Constitutional
Convention.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.621
So it's not as though everyone
said, "Hey,

00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.680
we need a new constitution and
it's got to be stronger.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.830
Let's go." Right?
 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.806
They're--It's a process at
which people are really figuring

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:29.038
things out as they go.
 

00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:32.883
And today I want to stress that
same message:

00:02:32.883 --> 00:02:36.639
that the Constitution was not
inevitable.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.210
And I know that's obvious on
the one hand,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.220
but on the other hand,
it's so ingrained in us,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.906
I think, to think that it's a
great idea that of course would

00:02:42.906 --> 00:02:45.411
happen sooner or later,
that I feel the need at the

00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:47.199
outset of the lecture to say
this,

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.220
that obviously it was not
inevitable.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.602
We think to ourselves:
well, of course the

00:02:51.602 --> 00:02:54.390
Articles--what a goofy
government the Articles of

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.502
Confederation was;
of course they've got to come

00:02:56.502 --> 00:02:58.304
up with something better;
of course it's going to be

00:02:58.304 --> 00:03:00.877
stronger;
of course it's going to end up

00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:03.120
looking like our Constitution.
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.213
And obviously the problem with
that whole river of "of

00:03:07.213 --> 00:03:10.319
courses"
is that if you travel down that

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.768
stream you miss one of the most
important aspects of the process

00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:19.876
of creating the Constitution,
and that is that it was a

00:03:19.876 --> 00:03:23.060
process, that it was a debate.
 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.775
It was a national debate during
which people really seriously

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:28.854
considered what they were doing,
what the implications were of

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:32.229
what they were doing,
and they did not all agree on

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:34.419
what was a good or bad idea.
 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.668
So the process,
the fact that there actually

00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:40.008
was a debate,
is significant.

00:03:40.008 --> 00:03:44.782
And it's not a process that was
entirely disconnected from the

00:03:44.782 --> 00:03:45.800
Revolution.
 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.591
The things that Americans had
been yelling about during the

00:03:48.591 --> 00:03:51.526
Revolution--right?--they talked
in a variety of different ways

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:53.855
about liberties;
they talked in a variety of

00:03:53.855 --> 00:03:56.081
different ways about
rights--that wasn't just

00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:56.690
rhetoric.
 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.276
People were truly arguing about
and defending specific

00:04:00.276 --> 00:04:03.798
fundamental rights and
privileges that they felt they

00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:08.663
deserved as British subjects,
and of course the end result

00:04:08.663 --> 00:04:12.050
about that fight was the
Revolution.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.788
So now we're years later,
and we're looking at arguments

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:17.725
over a new form of government,
and some of these same things

00:04:17.725 --> 00:04:19.069
are being yelled about.
 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:21.850
So, as you're going to see in
the course of today's lecture,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.247
in one way or another people
are still fretting about sort of

00:04:25.247 --> 00:04:28.079
what they consider to be
fundamental liberties,

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:29.980
basic rights.
 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.300
People considered these things
to be the legacy of the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.184
Revolution and they didn't want
to give them away before they'd

00:04:37.184 --> 00:04:39.440
even really begun to enjoy them.
 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.149
So think back for a
minute--many moons ago;

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.041
it's so long ago in the
semester--but think back to when

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:48.512
we were talking about the vote
for independence,

00:04:48.512 --> 00:04:50.670
and I mentioned Pauline Maier's
book.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.324
And I talked about how in her
book she has a chapter in which

00:04:53.324 --> 00:04:55.889
she talks about the other
declarations of independence,

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.442
and she really shows how on a
local level people were getting

00:04:59.442 --> 00:05:02.050
together and debating as groups
in towns,

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.903
in counties:
what do you think about

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.709
independence and should we
actually support this?--

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:08.699
that that was actually a real
debate.

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.762
And what I'm talking about
here, what I will be talking

00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:14.088
about over the course of this
lecture,

00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:16.550
it's a similar process of
debate in which people

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.166
throughout the country were
really trying to figure

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:20.110
something out.
 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.259
They knew it was a major
decision.

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:25.519
They were hoping whatever was
going to happen was going to be

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:28.019
a smart decision,
but it's an actual debate.

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:32.026
And along these lines,
as you'll see by the end of

00:05:32.026 --> 00:05:35.300
today's lecture,
this is not the kind of lecture

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.579
in which I'm going to give you
this deep textual analysis of

00:05:38.579 --> 00:05:39.690
the Constitution.
 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.752
Basically, I've got this
lecture and a little bit of the

00:05:41.752 --> 00:05:43.480
next lecture to talk about the
Constitution.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.062
I'm sure the Founders are
spinning in their graves like:

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:47.995
"what,
forty-five minutes to give to

00:05:47.995 --> 00:05:51.411
the Constitution?"--
but that's where we are in the

00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:52.170
semester.
 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.790
Given that I only have that
amount of time,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.452
what I really want to focus on
is the process of creating the

00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:01.012
Constitution,
and in doing that I'm also

00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:04.723
going to talk about a handful of
ongoing controversies that we

00:06:04.723 --> 00:06:08.314
have seen before during the
Revolution in an earlier part of

00:06:08.314 --> 00:06:11.084
this course,
and we're going to see them

00:06:11.084 --> 00:06:14.802
again toward the end of this
lecture when we focus on some of

00:06:14.802 --> 00:06:17.718
the main areas that became
controversies for the

00:06:17.718 --> 00:06:19.639
Constitutional Convention.
 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:22.137
Now I think in the same way
that we have all these "of

00:06:22.137 --> 00:06:24.077
courses"--
of course we know what's going

00:06:24.077 --> 00:06:25.920
to happen,
it's the Constitution--I think

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.689
it's also easy for us to walk
down the "of course"

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.754
trail when we think about
nationalists like James Madison

00:06:31.754 --> 00:06:33.069
or Alexander Hamilton.
 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:35.291
On some sort of basic level,
we assume well,

00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:36.480
they're right,
right?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.372
They're the smart guys;
they're right,

00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:41.548
and anyone who is against them
is sort of a shortsighted,

00:06:41.548 --> 00:06:44.497
limited-minded person who
clearly isn't thinking on a

00:06:44.497 --> 00:06:45.860
broad, smart level.
 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.197
Right?
 

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:49.464
I think almost instinctively
because we think what we think

00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:52.505
about our Constitution,
we think that way about whoever

00:06:52.505 --> 00:06:54.139
supported it or did not.
 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.800
Now certainly,
these nationalists felt like

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.810
they were vindicating the
Revolution, right?

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.387
So if you'd asked them,
they would have told you that

00:07:04.387 --> 00:07:07.016
they felt they were preserving
the achievements of the

00:07:07.016 --> 00:07:09.622
Revolution;
they were fending off chaos and

00:07:09.622 --> 00:07:13.228
a variety of other things that
would defeat what had been won

00:07:13.228 --> 00:07:14.490
in the Revolution.
 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.129
And from our vantage point,
we can look back,

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:19.110
we see that,
and that makes sense,

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.470
but this wasn't the only
argument that was circulating at

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.370
the time.
 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.079
So even before the
Constitutional Convention met,

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:32.180
people had valid fears about
what might result from it,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.836
and they were fears that were
strong enough that some people

00:07:34.836 --> 00:07:37.314
didn't even think their states
should participate in the

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:37.990
Convention.
 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.160
Never mind arguing about
ratification.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.930
I'm backing us way up.
 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.541
There were many people who just
thought: 'I don't want to--I

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:49.091
don't think our state should
participate in this whole idea

00:07:49.091 --> 00:07:51.050
of revising the government.'
 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.440
In some way or another,
some people feared that

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.038
strengthening the national
government was a kind of

00:07:56.038 --> 00:07:59.519
counterattack against everything
that the Revolution had meant.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:03.759
And I want to give you a sense
of the flavor of this debate,

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:06.310
this actually sort of
pre-Convention debate in which

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.410
the states are figuring out what
to do,

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.100
and I'm going local again.
 

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.367
Right?
 

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:13.098
I sort of--To give you a sense
of on-the-ground reality during

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:14.932
the Revolution,
I went local when I talked

00:08:14.932 --> 00:08:16.589
about the invasion of New Haven.
 

00:08:16.589 --> 00:08:19.851
So for just a couple minutes
here I want to go local again

00:08:19.851 --> 00:08:23.113
and just give you a flavor of
the debate that was going on

00:08:23.113 --> 00:08:26.261
here in Connecticut after the
Confederation Congress had

00:08:26.261 --> 00:08:28.550
passed a resolution saying:
okay,

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.346
we think that the states should
select delegates to send them to

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:38.220
this Convention that's going to
happen to revise the articles.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:38.450
Right?
 

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.331
They're not saying,
'Go destroy the Articles'--but

00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:41.330
they are saying,
'Okay.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.311
Revising the Articles might be
okay'--and once the

00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:46.988
Confederation Congress makes
that resolution,

00:08:46.988 --> 00:08:49.240
the states now debate what to
do.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.846
So on May 12,1787,
the Connecticut legislature

00:08:52.846 --> 00:08:56.453
began debating whether
Connecticut should send

00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:00.221
delegates to this proposed
Convention to meet in

00:09:00.221 --> 00:09:04.548
Philadelphia that was coming up
in a couple of--

00:09:04.548 --> 00:09:06.710
was coming up very soon as a
matter of fact.

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:10.240
Now most newspapers that
reported on what happened

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.350
explicitly mentioned four
members of the Connecticut House

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.241
who came forward and declared
that they were opposed to

00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:21.269
sending delegates to the
Convention.

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:24.495
All of these men were from
small towns near the

00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:26.110
Massachusetts border.
 

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.760
And all of them in one way or
another warned that sending a

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.476
delegate to this Convention
would endanger the liberties and

00:09:33.476 --> 00:09:35.240
privileges of Americans.
 

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.176
So Elijah Fitch--I love the
fact that their names are

00:09:38.176 --> 00:09:39.969
preserved--
Elijah Fitch said the

00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:42.239
Convention might end up
abridging the people's

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:44.558
privileges by creating some kind
of a big,

00:09:44.558 --> 00:09:48.433
unjust, centralized government
that just wouldn't consider the

00:09:48.433 --> 00:09:50.149
individual person at all.
 

00:09:50.149 --> 00:09:54.154
Daniel Perkins said that the
men who probably would be named

00:09:54.154 --> 00:09:58.159
as delegates to this supposed
Convention would probably be a

00:09:58.159 --> 00:10:01.042
bunch of rich,
aristocratic-type men who

00:10:01.042 --> 00:10:04.354
wouldn't understand or care
about the problems of the

00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.638
average person in Connecticut,
never mind the poor of

00:10:07.638 --> 00:10:08.298
Connecticut.
 

00:10:08.298 --> 00:10:11.216
So Perkins thought,
whatever comes out of this

00:10:11.216 --> 00:10:14.070
Convention is bound to just ruin
the poor;

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.308
it's going to be some weird,
aristocratic decision.

00:10:17.308 --> 00:10:20.135
Hosea Humphrey said that the
Convention would probably

00:10:20.135 --> 00:10:23.442
somehow or other take away the
rights of Connecticut to protest

00:10:23.442 --> 00:10:25.308
against things,
to veto things;

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:27.953
somehow or other it's going to
be more centralized,

00:10:27.953 --> 00:10:30.970
so Connecticut is going to lose
power in this equation.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.436
And the fourth representative,
named Abraham Granger,

00:10:34.436 --> 00:10:36.769
was particularly
straightforward.

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:39.629
He said, he knew that his
constituents didn't want

00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:42.955
delegates to be sent to this
Convention and he represented

00:10:42.955 --> 00:10:45.289
them, so first of all,
there it was.

00:10:45.289 --> 00:10:47.798
He had no choice;
he had to just do what they

00:10:47.798 --> 00:10:50.264
wanted him to do and say,
'No, we should not send

00:10:50.264 --> 00:10:52.423
delegates to the Convention,'
but he added,

00:10:52.423 --> 00:10:53.710
he agreed with them.
 

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.288
He actually thought that this
Convention was a bad idea,

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:59.471
and he stated specifically,
the reason why he didn't like

00:10:59.471 --> 00:11:02.769
the whole idea of a Convention
was probably it would end up

00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:05.903
creating a monarchy,
and then we'd be right back to

00:11:05.903 --> 00:11:07.158
where we were before.
 

00:11:07.158 --> 00:11:10.601
So all of these men,
either directly or by

00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:13.462
implication,
clearly they're rejecting the

00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:16.394
idea that the Union or
Connecticut is in such horrible

00:11:16.394 --> 00:11:18.440
shape that something must be
done;

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.408
we need a new government.
 

00:11:19.408 --> 00:11:22.190
They're not traveling down that
trail.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.788
Granger actually in the course
of his remarks explicitly said

00:11:25.788 --> 00:11:29.028
that the Confederation Congress
had plenty of power;

00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:32.352
the Articles of Confederation
joined with Connecticut's own

00:11:32.352 --> 00:11:36.019
constitution would be just fine
for the people of Connecticut.

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:39.929
Implied in some of the comments
of what these men said is the

00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:43.450
idea that anything could happen
at this Convention,

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.216
and obviously that's something
I've talked about before in this

00:11:45.216 --> 00:11:47.567
course as well,
but you can hear it underlying

00:11:47.567 --> 00:11:49.100
a lot of their comments.
 

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.139
Who knows what's going to come
out of this Convention?

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:55.370
Anything could happen and odds
are whatever happens,

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.038
some fundamental American
privileges and rights are going

00:11:59.038 --> 00:12:01.912
to be taken away,
potentially by a bunch of

00:12:01.912 --> 00:12:05.284
wealthy, aristocratic guys who
are going to be the ones

00:12:05.284 --> 00:12:08.408
standing in that room in
Philadelphia debating.

00:12:08.408 --> 00:12:11.798
So they're basically imagining
the Convention's going to be a

00:12:11.798 --> 00:12:14.849
bunch of aristocrats who are
going to subvert a popular

00:12:14.849 --> 00:12:18.293
revolution and maybe even just
toss the new country right back

00:12:18.293 --> 00:12:20.778
into a monarchical form of
government.

00:12:20.778 --> 00:12:23.697
So those are the four people
who at least the newspapers

00:12:23.697 --> 00:12:26.668
noted as really standing forth
against the Convention.

00:12:26.668 --> 00:12:29.846
Now of course,
the newspapers also reported on

00:12:29.846 --> 00:12:33.940
nine men who spoke in favor of
attending the Convention.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.428
All of them were from
commercial areas.

00:12:37.428 --> 00:12:39.405
They all argued,
as you would expect them to

00:12:39.405 --> 00:12:40.953
argue,
that the well-being of the

00:12:40.953 --> 00:12:43.658
Union and the well-being of the
state of Connecticut really,

00:12:43.658 --> 00:12:46.899
really required a stronger
central government.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:50.750
One of these nine even brought
up an embarrassing example of

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.600
how powerless the Congress was
that involved Connecticut.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.206
He said, 'You know,
recently, the Confederation

00:12:57.206 --> 00:12:59.964
Congress asked the states,
including Connecticut,

00:12:59.964 --> 00:13:01.889
that they requisition money
from us,

00:13:01.889 --> 00:13:04.549
and we just decided we didn't
feel like giving them any,

00:13:04.549 --> 00:13:06.860
and they couldn't do anything.
 

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:07.870
Remember?
 

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:11.033
[laughs]
They asked us for something and

00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:14.440
we said no and that was the end
of that.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.419
Remember, guys?
 

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:18.293
Oh, that's like a sign;
they don't have power because

00:13:18.293 --> 00:13:21.519
we watched them not have power
when we just said no.'

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:23.820
And he--this one delegate went
on to say, 'Well,

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.240
what about--Think about it.
 

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.549
That's not even a problem.
 

00:13:26.549 --> 00:13:27.690
What about problems to come?
 

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.370
What if the Union begins to
disintegrate?

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.158
What if the Union is invaded?
 

00:13:33.158 --> 00:13:37.388
What would the Confederation
Congress be able to do about

00:13:37.388 --> 00:13:39.048
problems like that?'
 

00:13:39.048 --> 00:13:41.803
So obviously in the end,
it's that kind of an argument

00:13:41.803 --> 00:13:44.868
that wins out and Connecticut
voted to send delegates to the

00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:47.525
Convention,
but obviously also not without

00:13:47.525 --> 00:13:48.440
a real debate.
 

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.549
So even participating in the
Convention was a big deal that

00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:58.219
required serious debate,
and we haven't even gotten to

00:13:58.219 --> 00:14:00.070
ratification yet.
 

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.043
As a matter of fact,
it was such a big deal that one

00:14:03.043 --> 00:14:04.578
state,
the state of Rhode

00:14:04.578 --> 00:14:07.609
Island--Rhode Island is
consistent throughout my entire

00:14:07.609 --> 00:14:09.827
class--
Rhode Island decided not to

00:14:09.827 --> 00:14:10.320
attend.
 

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.505
They actually just decided:
no, we're not participating,

00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:14.548
we're not going.
 

00:14:14.548 --> 00:14:17.519
So there were actually only
twelve states represented at the

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:18.929
Constitutional Convention.
 

00:14:18.929 --> 00:14:21.710
Rhode Island was a holdout.
 

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:26.048
So clearly, so serious that one
state is just not there.

00:14:26.048 --> 00:14:28.256
So ultimately twelve states
sent delegates to the Federal

00:14:28.256 --> 00:14:28.769
Convention.
 

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:31.389
And I should add here,
just to not confuse you,

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:33.976
sometimes I know I'm saying
Federal Convention and sometimes

00:14:33.976 --> 00:14:35.730
I'm saying Constitutional
Convention,

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.769
and they're two ways of
referring to the same thing.

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:40.172
Some historians say Federal
Convention because if you think

00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:41.815
about it,
every state could have a

00:14:41.815 --> 00:14:44.678
constitutional convention but
there can actually be maybe,

00:14:44.678 --> 00:14:47.827
hopefully one Federal
Convention, but you can use

00:14:47.827 --> 00:14:48.678
either one.
 

00:14:48.678 --> 00:14:50.942
You have my full permission to
call it either the

00:14:50.942 --> 00:14:53.490
Constitutional Convention or the
Federal Convention.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.889
So twelve states sent delegates
to the Federal Convention.

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:59.730
It met between May and
September of 1787.

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:02.950
Rhode Island obviously,
as I said, was not there.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:07.802
From those twelve states,
fifty-five delegates attended

00:15:07.802 --> 00:15:09.960
the Convention in all.
 

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.235
And I suppose,
as you might expect,

00:15:12.235 --> 00:15:14.778
overall they were well-educated
men.

00:15:14.778 --> 00:15:16.990
A lot of them were trained as
lawyers.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.099
A lot of them had experience
working in their state

00:15:20.099 --> 00:15:20.970
governments.
 

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:24.522
A good number of them had
experience serving in either the

00:15:24.522 --> 00:15:27.950
Continental Congresses or the
Confederation Congress.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.551
Now that said,
this doesn't mean that these

00:15:30.551 --> 00:15:33.770
were sort of professional
politicians sitting down to

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.320
write a constitution.
 

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.894
It's not as though they've
prepared their lives for this

00:15:38.894 --> 00:15:39.480
moment.
 

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.386
They're people who've been
involved in public life but they

00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:45.595
certainly have not been training
to sit down and create an entire

00:15:45.595 --> 00:15:47.500
constitution for a whole
country,

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.140
so despite that experience,
which I'm sure served them

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.971
well,
it does not suggest that they

00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.570
actually are just ready to go.
 

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.080
They're not entirely sure
what's going to happen.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:01.500
Now in some ways,
these delegates were kind of a

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.734
self-selecting group,
because people who were really

00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:09.288
dead set against the idea of
strengthening the national

00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:13.038
government basically just didn't
go to the Convention.

00:16:13.038 --> 00:16:16.599
The problem with that strategy
is--on the part of certainly the

00:16:16.599 --> 00:16:19.009
people who didn't like this
whole idea--

00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:22.460
by not being there,
they made it easy to achieve a

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:26.543
consensus among the people who
were there who were a little

00:16:26.543 --> 00:16:29.852
more comfortable with
strengthening the national

00:16:29.852 --> 00:16:31.048
government.
 

00:16:31.048 --> 00:16:33.578
Most of the people who were
there in one way or another

00:16:33.578 --> 00:16:35.639
ended up being nationalists in
some form,

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:37.943
and by nationalists I actually
don't just mean the James

00:16:37.943 --> 00:16:38.950
Madisons of the world.
 

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.706
There's a pretty wide spectrum
of people thinking about the

00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:44.224
fact that the national
government needs to be stronger

00:16:44.224 --> 00:16:47.017
and some of them,
Hamilton, Madison,

00:16:47.017 --> 00:16:51.061
extremo nationalists,
others not so much--there's a

00:16:51.061 --> 00:16:53.807
pretty wide range--
and there were some people at

00:16:53.807 --> 00:16:56.961
the Convention who weren't even
necessarily comfortable with a

00:16:56.961 --> 00:16:59.649
great amount of increased
strength and did not end up

00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:01.200
signing the Constitution.
 

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.860
So I'm not saying everyone
there is a firm nationalist.

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:06.540
But the really firm,
I suppose you'd call them at

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.950
this moment anti-nationalists,
didn't go for the most part.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:14.220
So since they were not there,
it meant that there was a

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:18.333
certain sort of fundamental
level of agreement at the

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:19.519
Convention.
 

00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:23.528
Now two of the delegates there
were particularly well known,

00:17:23.528 --> 00:17:27.074
and to people who were
wondering what the heck was

00:17:27.074 --> 00:17:31.074
going on in Philadelphia,
the presence of these two men

00:17:31.074 --> 00:17:32.640
made a big difference.
 

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.269
George Washington.
 

00:17:34.269 --> 00:17:35.368
George Washington was there.
 

00:17:35.368 --> 00:17:38.288
George Washington ended up
presiding over the Convention,

00:17:38.288 --> 00:17:40.740
which ended up being a pretty
important move.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.991
I've already talked in past
lectures about how he gained the

00:17:43.991 --> 00:17:47.078
trust of everybody by
continually surrendering power,

00:17:47.078 --> 00:17:49.690
so he's already a legend in his
time,

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.880
but also he's a trusted leader.
 

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.093
So certainly having him there
gave a certain status to

00:17:56.093 --> 00:17:58.935
whatever was going on,
meant that it was important,

00:17:58.935 --> 00:18:01.446
and meant that it was something
that was being treated

00:18:01.446 --> 00:18:04.146
responsibly because George
Washington had invested it with

00:18:04.146 --> 00:18:05.000
his presence.
 

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.548
Benjamin Franklin also attended.
 

00:18:08.548 --> 00:18:12.364
Again he's another man in this
period that--an American who had

00:18:12.364 --> 00:18:14.210
an international reputation.
 

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.308
I've talked a little bit about
him as well,

00:18:16.308 --> 00:18:18.878
and like Washington his
presence there suggested that

00:18:18.878 --> 00:18:21.348
whatever the heck was going on
in Philadelphia,

00:18:21.348 --> 00:18:23.660
it was important and it had
some major support.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.509
The fact that these two men
were there was significant.

00:18:26.509 --> 00:18:28.568
This is not the reason why he
was there,

00:18:28.568 --> 00:18:32.431
but I also am always happy when
anyone is anywhere who has a

00:18:32.431 --> 00:18:34.461
sense of humor,
so Franklin had one,

00:18:34.461 --> 00:18:37.013
and it's always good to have
the guy with a sense of humor at

00:18:37.013 --> 00:18:39.608
any large meeting of men who
have important things to say.

00:18:39.608 --> 00:18:42.223
So for that reason I personally
am happy that Benjamin Franklin

00:18:42.223 --> 00:18:42.730
was there.
 

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.069
Now as I suggested on Tuesday,
Madison also played a major

00:18:47.069 --> 00:18:49.689
role,
and I talked at the end of

00:18:49.689 --> 00:18:54.093
Tuesday's lecture about his
amazing notes that he recorded

00:18:54.093 --> 00:18:57.029
partly thinking ahead to
posterity.

00:18:57.029 --> 00:19:00.875
His notes ended up being even
more significant because it was

00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:04.529
agreed at the start of the
Convention that its proceedings

00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:06.710
would be kept entirely secret.
 

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.875
The logic of that being that if
it was really,

00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:14.025
really kept entirely secret,
the people who were there would

00:19:14.025 --> 00:19:16.980
feel free to really speak their
minds.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.578
They really wanted an open,
full, honest debate,

00:19:20.578 --> 00:19:23.682
so if people there really
believed that the public would

00:19:23.682 --> 00:19:26.836
not know what they were saying,
someone for example might feel

00:19:26.836 --> 00:19:28.961
free to stand up and say,
'I personally would like a

00:19:28.961 --> 00:19:29.390
monarchy.'
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.567
Right?
 

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:30.880
If people thought the public
was watching,

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.273
no one's going to utter the
"m"-word at the

00:19:33.273 --> 00:19:36.705
Constitutional Convention,
but if it's really secret,

00:19:36.705 --> 00:19:41.382
the idea was it would allow for
much more open and free and

00:19:41.382 --> 00:19:43.720
potentially useful debate.
 

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.009
And there's actually--I can't
resist.

00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:49.702
There's actually a story about
the secrecy of the Federal

00:19:49.702 --> 00:19:52.539
Convention which I will offer
you because it's also a George

00:19:52.539 --> 00:19:54.557
Washington--
yet another George Washington

00:19:54.557 --> 00:19:54.859
story.
 

00:19:54.859 --> 00:19:56.269
I can't resist it.
 

00:19:56.269 --> 00:19:59.549
And it's actually--it really is
a way of showing how important

00:19:59.549 --> 00:20:02.346
people at the time considered
the idea of keeping the

00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:03.528
Convention secret.
 

00:20:03.528 --> 00:20:06.734
And it's from the notes of a
delegate who was there at the

00:20:06.734 --> 00:20:09.210
convention and his name is
William Pierce.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:14.019
And supposedly at some point in
the Convention,

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:17.500
somebody found a page of notes
about the proceedings on the

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.680
floor of the state house and
brought this up to George

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:23.880
Washington and said,
"Somebody lost these."

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.280
Okay.
 

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:28.782
So Washington takes the lost
notes and at the end of that

00:20:28.782 --> 00:20:32.240
day's session he stands up and
he says,

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.170
"Before we adjourn--"
I'll read his precise words:

00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:38.150
"Gentlemen,
I am sorry to find that some

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:42.416
one Member of this Body has been
so neglectful of the secrets of

00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:46.413
the Convention as to drop in the
State House a copy of their

00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:49.859
proceedings,
which by accident was picked up

00:20:49.859 --> 00:20:52.230
and delivered to me this
Morning.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.403
I must entreat Gentlemen to be
more careful,

00:20:55.403 --> 00:20:59.758
lest our premature speculations
disturb the public repose by

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:02.118
getting into the newspapers.
 

00:21:02.118 --> 00:21:04.420
I know not whose paper it
is,"

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.304
and then he said "but
there it is,"

00:21:07.304 --> 00:21:10.910
and he sort of threw it down on
the table and added,

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.970
"Let him who owns it take
it."

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:17.307
And according to Pierce,
he bowed, picked up his hat and

00:21:17.307 --> 00:21:20.038
left the room,
quote, "with a dignity so

00:21:20.038 --> 00:21:22.700
severe that every Person seemed
alarmed."

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.210
Okay, the power of George.
 

00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:25.527
Right?
 

00:21:25.527 --> 00:21:28.335
He just sort of threw his
weight around and everyone's

00:21:28.335 --> 00:21:29.130
like: uh oh.
 

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.198
So Pierce writes that
immediately everyone started

00:21:31.198 --> 00:21:33.690
checking their pockets and their
notes, like: 'I really hope

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.720
those are not my notes;
please don't be my notes.'

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.430
Pierce says to his horror he
discovered that his were lost,

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.798
so he kind of goes up to the
front of the room,

00:21:42.798 --> 00:21:45.994
and he kind of peeks at the
notes and he's really relieved

00:21:45.994 --> 00:21:47.788
to discover: they're not mine.
 

00:21:47.788 --> 00:21:48.027
Okay.
 

00:21:48.027 --> 00:21:49.740
That means that his notes are
lost;

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.242
[laughter]
that means two people's notes

00:21:52.242 --> 00:21:52.950
are lost.
 

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.269
And Pierce then later says that
he remembered,

00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:59.930
oh, yeah, I left them in my
coat pocket in the boarding

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.573
house where I'm staying--
and he found them and got them

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:05.690
and hopefully everything was
okay.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.452
But I love the fact that he's
really relieved like:

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:10.828
oh, good, at least those aren't
my notes;

00:22:10.828 --> 00:22:13.250
they're someone else's really
lost notes.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.395
And according to Pierce,
Washington's reprimand was so

00:22:16.395 --> 00:22:19.838
off-putting that nobody ever
claimed the piece of paper.

00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:22.035
[laughter]
It will just stay there,

00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:24.358
[laughs]
the scary piece of paper.

00:22:24.358 --> 00:22:28.231
So obviously Madison's notes
are important also partly

00:22:28.231 --> 00:22:31.971
because this was very secret,
but of course,

00:22:31.971 --> 00:22:37.078
as I hinted at the very end of
Tuesday's lecture,

00:22:37.078 --> 00:22:39.597
what's particularly significant
about Madison's role in the

00:22:39.597 --> 00:22:41.986
Convention is his creation of a
plan of government which

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:43.940
ultimately is known as the
Virginia Plan.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:48.170
Madison arrived at the
Convention with a plan of

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.400
government in hand,
so in a sense he immediately

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.920
set the terms of debate.
 

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.112
It was a really strategic
move--and I'll add at this point

00:22:58.112 --> 00:23:01.471
that when you go off in to the
future and have wonderful jobs

00:23:01.471 --> 00:23:04.832
that in one way or another will
require you to have committee

00:23:04.832 --> 00:23:07.732
meetings of various sorts,
the little lesson,

00:23:07.732 --> 00:23:11.009
the life lesson that James
Madison teaches us here is,

00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:13.130
if you set the agenda of the
meeting,

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.941
you set the terms of debate and
you make it much more likely

00:23:16.941 --> 00:23:17.910
that you win.
 

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:18.210
Right?
 

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:21.167
So remember James Madison down
the road in your professional

00:23:21.167 --> 00:23:21.618
lives.
 

00:23:21.618 --> 00:23:24.413
He really does something very
brilliant strategically by

00:23:24.413 --> 00:23:27.259
walking in and regardless of
what is going to happen--

00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:28.318
he doesn't know what's going to
happen,

00:23:28.318 --> 00:23:32.690
but he literally at least
started out by setting the terms

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:33.608
of debate.
 

00:23:33.608 --> 00:23:35.808
Now he may have devised this
plan of government,

00:23:35.808 --> 00:23:39.756
but given that people already
knew he was sort of an extreme

00:23:39.756 --> 00:23:43.433
nationalist,
he wisely decided he would not

00:23:43.433 --> 00:23:47.088
stand up and present this plan
himself,

00:23:47.088 --> 00:23:49.577
thinking--and probably rightly
so--that if he stood up and made

00:23:49.577 --> 00:23:51.605
a recommendation,
some people would immediately

00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:54.308
distrust it as coming from some
kind of an extreme nationalist.

00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:58.301
So instead, he asked fellow
Virginia delegate Edmund

00:23:58.301 --> 00:24:00.730
Randolph to present the plan.
 

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.787
And Randolph was popular and
Randolph was influential and

00:24:03.787 --> 00:24:07.227
unlike Madison Randolph was also
a good public speaker so it was

00:24:07.227 --> 00:24:08.210
a wise choice.
 

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:11.571
So on May 29,
just a few days after the

00:24:11.571 --> 00:24:15.392
Convention opened,
Randolph stood up and very

00:24:15.392 --> 00:24:19.919
diplomatically and very gently
opened the subject of altering

00:24:19.919 --> 00:24:22.410
the Articles of Confederation.
 

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:26.118
Though, as you're about to see,
what he ends up suggesting is

00:24:26.118 --> 00:24:27.848
not altering the Articles.
 

00:24:27.848 --> 00:24:31.200
So first he reviewed the
weaknesses of the Articles,

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:35.808
and then he proposed a series
of resolutions,

00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:39.328
the first one intended to just
calm the nervous down and sort

00:24:39.328 --> 00:24:42.261
of put people off guard:
nothing scary is happening

00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:42.788
here.
 

00:24:42.788 --> 00:24:44.759
So he first says,
"Resolved,

00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:47.970
that the Articles of
Confederation ought to be so

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.916
corrected and enlarged as to
accomplish the objects proposed

00:24:51.916 --> 00:24:55.320
by their institution;
namely common defense,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.098
security of liberty,
and general welfare."

00:24:59.098 --> 00:25:03.660
So Randolph there says he's
proposing to correct and enlarge

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.818
the Articles.
 

00:25:04.818 --> 00:25:09.163
What followed that statement
was a rather radical plan of

00:25:09.163 --> 00:25:13.430
government that was not a
correction of the Articles.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:17.523
Instead it pretty much proposed
to demolish the Articles and

00:25:17.523 --> 00:25:21.686
create in their place a strong
national government that would

00:25:21.686 --> 00:25:24.880
be grounded not on the
individual states,

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.940
but instead on the people
themselves.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.942
This plan of government--the
Virginia Plan is ultimately what

00:25:31.942 --> 00:25:36.011
it's called--proposed that the
new government would have three

00:25:36.011 --> 00:25:36.880
branches.
 

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.328
The first would be a bicameral
legislature.

00:25:41.328 --> 00:25:44.308
The lower house would be
elected by the people.

00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:48.078
The upper house would be
selected by the lower house from

00:25:48.078 --> 00:25:50.838
candidates named by state
legislatures.

00:25:50.838 --> 00:25:54.824
The legislature would have the
power to nullify any state law

00:25:54.824 --> 00:25:59.675
contrary to the Constitution,
and representation--as I

00:25:59.675 --> 00:26:02.753
mentioned--
in the lower house is based on

00:26:02.753 --> 00:26:03.440
population.
 

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:08.740
The second branch was the
national executive.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.286
In the Virginia Plan,
the executive would have a

00:26:12.286 --> 00:26:15.230
qualified veto over acts of
Congress.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.335
The plan didn't specify whether
the executive would be a single

00:26:19.335 --> 00:26:21.190
individual or a committee.
 

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:22.670
People talked about both.
 

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.980
The term of office wasn't
specified either.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.134
And then obviously,
the third branch was the

00:26:29.134 --> 00:26:32.623
national judiciary,
which would consist of one or

00:26:32.623 --> 00:26:35.660
more supreme judges and some
inferior courts,

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.278
to be chosen by the national
legislature to hold office

00:26:39.278 --> 00:26:40.818
during good behavior.
 

00:26:40.818 --> 00:26:43.788
So I'll repeat that:
Bicameral legislature;

00:26:43.788 --> 00:26:45.640
lower house elected by the
people;

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.866
upper house selected by the
lower house from candidates

00:26:48.866 --> 00:26:52.413
named by state legislatures;
the legislature can nullify any

00:26:52.413 --> 00:26:54.788
state law that violates the
Constitution;

00:26:54.788 --> 00:26:57.450
representation is based on
population.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:01.590
Branch two is the executive who
has a qualified veto over acts

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.868
of Congress,
and it's not specified--one

00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:04.943
person,
many people,

00:27:04.943 --> 00:27:06.798
how long you should be in
office.

00:27:06.798 --> 00:27:09.185
And then the third branch,
the judiciary,

00:27:09.185 --> 00:27:12.346
with one or more supreme judges
chosen by the national

00:27:12.346 --> 00:27:15.450
legislature holding office
during good behavior.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:20.772
The Virginia Plan also included
a flexible amendment process and

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:24.660
a procedure for the admission of
new states.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.017
Now, as you can hear there,
the basic outline of the final

00:27:29.017 --> 00:27:33.068
Constitution is kind of sitting
there in that plan.

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:36.654
A sort of fundamental frame of
what's coming in the next few

00:27:36.654 --> 00:27:39.509
months is contained within the
Virginia Plan.

00:27:39.509 --> 00:27:42.190
So from the start of the
Convention,

00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:45.298
things look a little auspicious
for the nationalists,

00:27:45.298 --> 00:27:48.810
and sure enough relatively
early on in the Convention

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.593
there's a vote that a new
national government ought to be

00:27:52.593 --> 00:27:56.509
established and it should have a
supreme legislative,

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:59.608
executive, and judiciary branch.
 

00:27:59.608 --> 00:28:03.759
Now that's a pretty major thing
to decide.

00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:06.958
It's a pretty major victory for
people who are really firm

00:28:06.958 --> 00:28:09.798
nationalists;
that, okay, the Convention now

00:28:09.798 --> 00:28:13.798
has committed to setting up a
supreme central government with

00:28:13.798 --> 00:28:15.000
three branches.
 

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.808
And some more nationalist
victories followed.

00:28:18.808 --> 00:28:21.663
So for example,
the Confederation decided that

00:28:21.663 --> 00:28:25.152
the executive would be one man
after debating this for a

00:28:25.152 --> 00:28:27.038
while--
and I'll talk a little bit more

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.690
about this toward the end of the
lecture--

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.460
but they ultimately decided
that one man should be the

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.709
executive,
and clearly,

00:28:32.709 --> 00:28:35.272
in a world where you're scared
of centralized power and

00:28:35.272 --> 00:28:38.029
thinking about kings,
that's a big decision.

00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:41.228
And then they began to discuss
representation in the lower

00:28:41.228 --> 00:28:44.220
house of the legislature,
and I'm also going to come back

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.868
to representation in a few
minutes.

00:28:45.868 --> 00:28:47.368
But for now I'll simply state
the obvious,

00:28:47.368 --> 00:28:50.858
which is: of course this debate
broke down--

00:28:50.858 --> 00:28:54.363
as this debate always breaks
down--into small states versus

00:28:54.363 --> 00:28:57.019
large states,
small states not liking the

00:28:57.019 --> 00:29:00.460
idea of having representation be
based on population,

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:03.750
large states being perfectly
happy with that idea.

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.519
And small states had a good
reason to fear that their

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:09.236
influence would just be
eliminated in some degree if

00:29:09.236 --> 00:29:11.259
everything is based on
population.

00:29:11.259 --> 00:29:16.287
So on June 15,
William Patterson of New Jersey

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:20.311
proposed his own plan,
which becomes the New Jersey

00:29:20.311 --> 00:29:22.028
Plan--it's another New Jersey
moment,

00:29:22.028 --> 00:29:25.974
the New Jersey Plan--and of
course this is a plan that's

00:29:25.974 --> 00:29:29.848
much more popular among
small-state representatives.

00:29:29.848 --> 00:29:34.999
The New Jersey Plan suggested a
one-house legislature in which

00:29:34.999 --> 00:29:38.630
obviously each state would have
one vote.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:42.403
There would be a plural
executive--so an executive

00:29:42.403 --> 00:29:45.328
consisting of more than one
person--

00:29:45.328 --> 00:29:47.578
who would be elected by the
Congress,

00:29:47.578 --> 00:29:51.529
and a supreme court chosen by
the executive.

00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:54.593
Now you can see how in some
ways that there are little

00:29:54.593 --> 00:29:57.540
vestiges of the Articles sitting
there in that plan:

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.680
there's a unicameral
legislature;

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.328
each state has one vote.
 

00:30:01.328 --> 00:30:05.200
Even so, even though this is
supposedly a less centralized,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.048
less scary alternative to the
Virginia Plan,

00:30:09.048 --> 00:30:11.798
still it is giving more power
to the national government than

00:30:11.798 --> 00:30:12.900
the Articles had done.
 

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:16.401
Three days later,
someone successfully moved to

00:30:16.401 --> 00:30:20.663
postpone consideration of the
New Jersey Plan and instead

00:30:20.663 --> 00:30:23.858
consider simply revising the
Articles.

00:30:23.858 --> 00:30:26.505
You can imagine the sort of
"uh"

00:30:26.505 --> 00:30:28.568
going around the room:
oh, no.

00:30:28.568 --> 00:30:32.781
Now at this point,
Alexander Hamilton stood up and

00:30:32.781 --> 00:30:34.759
made a dramatic move.
 

00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:40.950
On June 18, he made what some
describe as a six-hour speech--

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:45.558
I can't imagine giving or
listening to a six-hour speech--

00:30:45.558 --> 00:30:49.160
in which he proposed his plan
of government,

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.920
which as you'll hear,
is really, really,

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:55.400
really, really centralized and
national.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.000
Basically, Hamilton's plan
reduced the states to

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.298
administrative subdivisions.
 

00:31:01.298 --> 00:31:05.183
Each would have a supreme
executive appointed by the

00:31:05.183 --> 00:31:09.553
national government;
a chief executive elected for

00:31:09.553 --> 00:31:14.567
life during good behavior,
elected by electors who were

00:31:14.567 --> 00:31:19.118
elected by electors who were
popularly chosen.

00:31:19.118 --> 00:31:19.454
Okay.
 

00:31:19.454 --> 00:31:22.203
How removed can we get the
people [laughs]

00:31:22.203 --> 00:31:25.288
from the process of choosing
the executive?

00:31:25.288 --> 00:31:29.747
Hamilton also proposed a senate
chosen for life during good

00:31:29.747 --> 00:31:33.818
behavior and an executive with
absolute veto power.

00:31:33.818 --> 00:31:34.108
Okay.
 

00:31:34.108 --> 00:31:36.190
That's way out there in scary
land.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.404
You can imagine--he gives a
six-hour speech and that's what

00:31:38.404 --> 00:31:39.130
he comes up with.
 

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.512
He also during the speech
praised the British government

00:31:41.512 --> 00:31:43.680
as the best government on the
face of the earth.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:44.160
Right?
 

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:46.400
[laughter]
That's Hamilton.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.000
So basically Hamilton never
lives down this speech.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.002
As a delegate later put it,
Hamilton's dramatic speech was

00:31:53.002 --> 00:31:56.059
"praised by everybody,
but supported by none."

00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:59.818
[laughs] It was like: thank you;
you can sit down now.

00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:02.826
And it really did haunt him to
the end of his days because it

00:32:02.826 --> 00:32:05.833
seemed to be eternal proof to
anybody who even vaguely didn't

00:32:05.833 --> 00:32:08.588
like him that he was really a
monarchist at heart--

00:32:08.588 --> 00:32:11.994
that he's just waiting for a
chance to convert the government

00:32:11.994 --> 00:32:14.380
into a monarchy with a king at
its head.

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.996
It's--You can see why it was
important to keep the

00:32:16.996 --> 00:32:20.307
proceedings secret and you can
see how they did not get--remain

00:32:20.307 --> 00:32:21.750
a secret for very long.
 

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.670
Right? Clearly they leaked.
 

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.913
If--this is like the tin can
tied to Hamilton's reputation

00:32:25.913 --> 00:32:27.450
for the rest of his life.
 

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.843
Clearly it's leaking,
but--yeah, he never lived down

00:32:31.843 --> 00:32:33.048
that speech.
 

00:32:33.048 --> 00:32:35.789
Now the question is:
why did he stand up and give

00:32:35.789 --> 00:32:36.588
that speech?
 

00:32:36.588 --> 00:32:39.673
Why did he stand up and praise
the British government as being

00:32:39.673 --> 00:32:42.048
the best government on the face
of the earth?

00:32:42.048 --> 00:32:43.765
Why did he propose this extreme
plan knowing how people felt

00:32:43.765 --> 00:32:44.579
about some of these ideas?
 

00:32:44.579 --> 00:32:47.140
And there is disagreement;
there is not agreement on this.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:53.058
Some historians assume that
this was a strategic move,

00:32:53.058 --> 00:32:55.708
and that Hamilton was trying to
push the Convention past the

00:32:55.708 --> 00:32:58.144
weak New Jersey Plan or,
horror or horrors,

00:32:58.144 --> 00:33:00.048
just revising the Articles.
 

00:33:00.048 --> 00:33:03.307
So according to this strategy,
Hamilton's plan would have

00:33:03.307 --> 00:33:06.623
looked so extreme that the
Virginia Plan would look really

00:33:06.623 --> 00:33:09.637
good in comparison,
and sure enough not that long

00:33:09.637 --> 00:33:12.320
after Hamilton's speech,
the New Jersey Plan is

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.009
defeated, so if this is why
Hamilton did this,

00:33:15.009 --> 00:33:17.640
maybe you could say it worked.
 

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.686
However, it's equally possible
that Hamilton wanted at least a

00:33:21.686 --> 00:33:25.536
moment to stand up and offer his
ideas and basically state,

00:33:25.536 --> 00:33:26.200
'Okay.
 

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.740
Here's my plan of government.
 

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.960
Here's my little moment to
shine.

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.788
Here's what I think we should
be doing.'

00:33:31.788 --> 00:33:34.867
And I always feel--I don't
which of these is true or not

00:33:34.867 --> 00:33:35.259
true.
 

00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:37.940
I think either one could be or
actually both could be,

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.570
but certainly the latter theory
has a little credence to it only

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.259
because you have to feel sorry
for Hamilton at the Convention.

00:33:45.259 --> 00:33:48.008
Here is this guy who for
roughly a decade has been saying

00:33:48.008 --> 00:33:50.019
we need a stronger national
government.

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:52.569
He's one of the first;
he's one of the strongest;

00:33:52.569 --> 00:33:54.869
he's consistent;
he's out there;

00:33:54.869 --> 00:33:56.288
this is his message.
 

00:33:56.288 --> 00:33:58.901
He finally gets the
Constitutional Convention and

00:33:58.901 --> 00:34:02.164
the other two delegates from New
York do not like the idea of

00:34:02.164 --> 00:34:05.430
really strengthening the
national government very much--

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:08.186
and it's one state,
one vote, so basically his vote

00:34:08.186 --> 00:34:09.510
doesn't matter at all.
 

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.300
So, this poor guy.
 

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.929
It's like: 'my mission,
my mission;

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.739
hey, finally I'm here and...
 

00:34:15.739 --> 00:34:17.139
I can't do anything.'
 

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:19.190
And it's like: aw, poor guy.
 

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.514
So it's possible that he did
actually stand up and say,

00:34:21.514 --> 00:34:22.289
'Okay, whatever.
 

00:34:22.289 --> 00:34:25.590
Here's what I would do
[laughs]--and I'm going to

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.340
announce this and never live it
down--

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.030
but here's what I would do
during this,

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.840
what should be my prime moment.'
 

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.592
So for one reason or
another--who knows whether it

00:34:34.592 --> 00:34:37.907
was strategic or because he
wanted his moment to lay out his

00:34:37.907 --> 00:34:39.822
plan--
the fact is that that night

00:34:39.822 --> 00:34:42.829
after he gave the amazing speech
he did meet with Madison and

00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:45.585
revise Madison's notes so that
they would be an accurate

00:34:45.585 --> 00:34:48.641
reflection of what he said just
in case anyone didn't hear him

00:34:48.641 --> 00:34:51.697
praise the British government as
the finest on the face of the

00:34:51.697 --> 00:34:52.449
earth.
 

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:53.829
[laughter] Okay.
 

00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:55.969
So a little truth in both,
I think.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:35:00.311
Now I'm about to do a really,
really grave injustice to the

00:35:00.311 --> 00:35:02.981
Constitution,
and so now is the moment when

00:35:02.981 --> 00:35:05.420
the Founders will be spinning in
their graves,

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.760
because I'm going to basically
condense my discussion of the

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.139
Constitution down to three main
issues,

00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:13.739
not because they're the only
issues that should be discussed,

00:35:13.739 --> 00:35:16.800
but because certainly they're
all important issues,

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.510
and because they show something
about how concerns--

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.994
issues--of the Revolution
continued to play a role in

00:35:23.994 --> 00:35:27.210
American politics and in
American public life.

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:30.853
I apologize to all Founders for
condensing the Constitution down

00:35:30.853 --> 00:35:32.010
into mere minutes.
 

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:32.409
Okay.
 

00:35:32.409 --> 00:35:37.039
The first issue that I want to
discuss is representation.

00:35:37.039 --> 00:35:39.503
And the question here,
the obvious one:

00:35:39.503 --> 00:35:41.840
population or one state,
one vote.

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.400
Small state, big state battle.
 

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.474
Small states are afraid of
having no influence,

00:35:46.474 --> 00:35:48.190
which they continue to be
afraid of.

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:50.389
This is not a battle that stops
once this decision is made.

00:35:50.389 --> 00:35:52.641
It continues on,
and in one way or another

00:35:52.641 --> 00:35:54.730
states are always sort of
objecting.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.070
There's a secession--potential
secession plot by New England in

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:01.302
the early nineteenth century
because they feel that they have

00:36:01.302 --> 00:36:02.219
no influence.
 

00:36:02.219 --> 00:36:05.081
So this doesn't go away,
but certainly at this point

00:36:05.081 --> 00:36:06.710
it's a real sticking point.
 

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:10.099
And ultimately a committee came
up with a solution,

00:36:10.099 --> 00:36:13.768
which is known either as the
Great Compromise or the

00:36:13.768 --> 00:36:16.867
Connecticut Compromise,
and the reason why it's the

00:36:16.867 --> 00:36:19.190
Connecticut Compromise is
because it was proposed by

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.920
Connecticut delegate Roger
Sherman.

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.880
Roger Sherman is a local boy.
 

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.099
Yet again New Haven appears on
the map.

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:27.309
Roger Sherman lived in New
Haven and actually--

00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:30.264
You may have not have noticed
it because I'm probably the geek

00:36:30.264 --> 00:36:32.929
who notices every historical
plaque in the universe,

00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:35.684
but on the front of the Union
League Caf� there actually is

00:36:35.684 --> 00:36:36.969
a plaque to Roger Sherman.
 

00:36:36.969 --> 00:36:37.880
It was his house.
 

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.804
Here was his house and here is
what he did and we like Roger

00:36:40.804 --> 00:36:41.300
Sherman.
 

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:42.940
So he's a New Haven guy.
 

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:46.134
He's the guy who proposes the
Connecticut Compromise and

00:36:46.134 --> 00:36:48.063
basically,
as you could predict,

00:36:48.063 --> 00:36:50.637
the compromise says
representation in the lower

00:36:50.637 --> 00:36:53.378
house will be based on
population and in the upper

00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:55.789
house one state,
one vote.

00:36:55.789 --> 00:37:00.539
And that gets passed on July
16,1787.

00:37:00.539 --> 00:37:05.018
So representation,
first major issue.

00:37:05.018 --> 00:37:07.797
Second major issue--although in
a way the problem with this one

00:37:07.797 --> 00:37:09.409
is that it was not a major
issue--

00:37:09.409 --> 00:37:13.385
is the question of slavery,
which clearly is linked to the

00:37:13.385 --> 00:37:15.409
question of representation.
 

00:37:15.409 --> 00:37:18.130
On August 8,
Northern states attacked

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.436
slavery on moral grounds and
proposed taking no account of

00:37:22.436 --> 00:37:27.121
slaves as part of the population
when allocating representation

00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:29.690
in the national legislature.
 

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:33.927
Now obviously many Southerners
did not like this idea and they

00:37:33.927 --> 00:37:37.400
defended slavery on moral and
economic grounds,

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.644
and they were joined by some
Northerners who were afraid that

00:37:40.644 --> 00:37:43.349
this issue was just going to
dissolve the Union.

00:37:43.349 --> 00:37:46.840
Gouverneur Morris of
Pennsylvania offers a nice sort

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.059
of example of the anti-slavery
point of view.

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:52.947
I'll quote Morris here:
"Upon what principle is it

00:37:52.947 --> 00:37:56.380
that the slaves shall be
computed in the representation?

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.440
Are they men?
 

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.760
Then make them citizens and let
them vote.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.909
Are they property?
 

00:38:01.909 --> 00:38:04.650
Why then is no other property
included?

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.126
The houses in this
city--Philadelphia--are worth

00:38:07.126 --> 00:38:09.920
more than all the wretched
slaves which cover the rice

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.449
swamps of South Carolina.
 

00:38:11.449 --> 00:38:13.570
The admission of slaves into
the representation,

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.454
when fairly explained,
comes to this:

00:38:15.454 --> 00:38:18.230
that the inhabitant of Georgia
and South Carolina,

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.867
who goes to the coast of
Africa, and in defiance of the

00:38:20.867 --> 00:38:23.753
most sacred laws of humanity,
tears his fellow creatures from

00:38:23.753 --> 00:38:26.478
their dearest connections,
and damns them to the most

00:38:26.478 --> 00:38:28.840
cruel bondage,
shall have more votes in a

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.684
government instituted for
protection of the rights of

00:38:31.684 --> 00:38:34.909
mankind than the citizen of
Pennsylvania or New Jersey,

00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:37.538
who views with a laudable
horror so nefarious a

00:38:37.538 --> 00:38:38.510
practice."
 

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.871
Wow.
 

00:38:38.871 --> 00:38:42.489
That's a statement--a strong
statement.

00:38:42.489 --> 00:38:46.485
Other side of the argument:
Charles Pinckney of South

00:38:46.485 --> 00:38:50.867
Carolina was among those who
stood up and tried to justify

00:38:50.867 --> 00:38:51.789
slavery.
 

00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:55.581
An example of his argument:
He said, "If slavery be

00:38:55.581 --> 00:38:59.719
wrong, it is justified by the
example of all the world....

00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:03.340
In all ages one half of mankind
have been slaves."

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:07.257
And he cited Greece and Rome
and other ancient city-states,

00:39:07.257 --> 00:39:11.039
as well as sanctions given to
slavery in modern times.

00:39:11.039 --> 00:39:14.487
So slavery is mentioned,
slavery has its moment of

00:39:14.487 --> 00:39:18.851
debate, but it is important to
note, it was in a sense a little

00:39:18.851 --> 00:39:20.469
more than a moment.
 

00:39:20.469 --> 00:39:22.389
It only occupied a few days.
 

00:39:22.389 --> 00:39:25.679
The issue was recognized to be
a deal breaker,

00:39:25.679 --> 00:39:28.963
and when the delegates held up
their concern over slavery

00:39:28.963 --> 00:39:31.250
against the idea of forming a
Union--

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:33.717
so basically when they saw that
if they really confront the

00:39:33.717 --> 00:39:35.590
issue of slavery,
they may never get a chance to

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.298
confront the issue of union--
they just decided not to

00:39:38.298 --> 00:39:40.199
confront the issue at all.
 

00:39:40.199 --> 00:39:43.958
And they memorialized their
inability to confront the issue

00:39:43.958 --> 00:39:47.115
in the document,
the Constitution itself,

00:39:47.115 --> 00:39:49.940
in Article I,
Section 9 of the Constitution,

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.829
and Article I deals with
Congress.

00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:55.108
It states that,
quote, "The Migration or

00:39:55.108 --> 00:39:59.579
Importation of such Persons as
any of the States now existing

00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:03.197
shall think proper to admit,
shall not be prohibited by the

00:40:03.197 --> 00:40:05.360
Congress prior to the Year one
thousand eight hundred and

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.487
eight"--
which basically says Congress

00:40:07.487 --> 00:40:09.570
can't stop the slave trade
before 1808.

00:40:09.570 --> 00:40:12.469
But look at how indirect that
language is.

00:40:12.469 --> 00:40:12.824
Right?
 

00:40:12.824 --> 00:40:16.018
It doesn't say what I just said
in very simple terms.

00:40:16.018 --> 00:40:19.164
The "Importation of such
Persons as any one of the States

00:40:19.164 --> 00:40:21.018
shall think proper to
admit."

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:24.510
Can there be a more indirect
way of referring to slavery?

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:27.820
They're tap dancing around this
issue.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:31.070
They're finding one way or
another just not to confront it,

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.768
so the word "slave"--
the word "slavery"--

00:40:33.768 --> 00:40:37.050
does not appear in the
Constitution.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.487
So basically faced with a
pretty fundamental moral

00:40:40.487 --> 00:40:44.766
problem, the delegates to the
Constitutional Convention looked

00:40:44.766 --> 00:40:46.030
the other way.
 

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:47.822
In their minds,
the Union was too tenuous for

00:40:47.822 --> 00:40:49.739
anything this controversial to
be addressed,

00:40:49.739 --> 00:40:53.096
and this kind of sort of
skipping out or not confronting

00:40:53.096 --> 00:40:56.818
the issue because it seems like
the deal-breaker would be seen

00:40:56.818 --> 00:41:00.237
again and again and again,
and obviously eventually it

00:41:00.237 --> 00:41:03.744
becomes the deal-breaker and it
does contribute to the breaking

00:41:03.744 --> 00:41:04.650
of the Union.
 

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:04.963
Okay.
 

00:41:04.963 --> 00:41:08.041
So representation,
slavery, two large issues under

00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:11.496
debate or not under debate
depending on which one you're

00:41:11.496 --> 00:41:12.690
talking about.
 

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:16.405
The third issue I want to bring
up concerned the national

00:41:16.405 --> 00:41:19.853
executive, and obviously that
really had links to the

00:41:19.853 --> 00:41:20.849
Revolution.
 

00:41:20.849 --> 00:41:24.809
The Revolution was a revolt
against strong centralized power

00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:27.630
in the form of a monarchy and a
monarch.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:32.382
We've seen in previous lectures
how state constitutions that

00:41:32.382 --> 00:41:37.135
were created in the 1770s really
showed this ongoing fear of

00:41:37.135 --> 00:41:40.599
tyrannical centralized executive
power.

00:41:40.599 --> 00:41:42.626
So we've seen,
when we were looking at those

00:41:42.626 --> 00:41:45.086
state constitutions,
how more often than not

00:41:45.086 --> 00:41:48.621
legislatures were given more
power and governors were denied

00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:49.460
some power.
 

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.730
It's the same fear,
the same spirit that's charging

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.018
the debate during the
Convention.

00:41:55.018 --> 00:41:58.050
So questions about the national
executive came up again and

00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:58.469
again.
 

00:41:58.469 --> 00:42:00.110
How should he be elected?
 

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:01.130
By electors?
 

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:04.369
By electors chosen by state
legislatures?

00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:06.070
By state governors?
 

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:07.809
By the national legislature?
 

00:42:07.809 --> 00:42:09.329
By popular election?
 

00:42:09.329 --> 00:42:11.800
How long should he serve?
 

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:16.639
Proposals ranged from two years
to life during good behavior.

00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:19.668
The ultimate compromise
suggested that the President

00:42:19.668 --> 00:42:23.469
would serve for a four-year term
and it didn't set a limit on how

00:42:23.469 --> 00:42:25.369
often he could be reelected.
 

00:42:25.369 --> 00:42:28.730
And he would be elected by
electors in the separate states,

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:31.371
which reassured delegates who
were worried about state

00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:34.311
rights--
and each state could decide for

00:42:34.311 --> 00:42:37.070
itself how to select its
electors.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.585
So if a state wanted to select
electors by popular election,

00:42:40.585 --> 00:42:41.360
they could.
 

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.925
If a state wanted to have their
legislature pick electors,

00:42:43.925 --> 00:42:44.510
they could.
 

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.007
Again, they're sort of allowing
the states to come up with their

00:42:48.007 --> 00:42:49.340
own way of doing this.
 

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.789
States still have rights.
 

00:42:50.789 --> 00:42:53.940
But still, big,
scary issue of the executive.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:57.418
So in a way this--all of these
sort of compromises and

00:42:57.418 --> 00:43:00.440
decisions end up creating an
executive who--

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:03.974
at least it felt like he was
being controlled in some way

00:43:03.974 --> 00:43:06.880
every four years by having to
face election.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:09.788
Now in some ways,
considering everything that I

00:43:09.788 --> 00:43:12.570
just said about being scared of
monarchy,

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:15.730
kings, America sort of slipping
right back into a monarchy,

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:19.030
this executive is granted a
surprising amount of power.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.610
He's Commander in Chief of the
armed forces.

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:23.719
He could carry on diplomacy.
 

00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:28.070
He could recommend measures to
Congress.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:31.407
He could exercise a veto,
although obviously it could be

00:43:31.407 --> 00:43:35.050
overturned by a two-thirds vote
in each house of Congress.

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:37.518
Part of the reason for this
amount of trust in the executive

00:43:37.518 --> 00:43:39.110
was the idea of checks and
balances.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.777
So people really actually did
believe in checks and balances

00:43:41.777 --> 00:43:43.949
and think that this isn't a
single executive,

00:43:43.949 --> 00:43:47.440
sort of scary and alone with no
way to check his power--

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:50.123
that the Constitution actually
seems to be kind of nicely

00:43:50.123 --> 00:43:52.217
balanced,
so that maybe this person

00:43:52.217 --> 00:43:55.800
actually has some restraints or
some reins pulling him in.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.570
Now obviously this is
the--I'm--I feel so bad.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.380
Hamilton, Madison--I'm so sorry.
 

00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.010
This is the most vast
overgeneralization of the

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:07.929
Constitution that I can almost
possibly imagine,

00:44:07.929 --> 00:44:10.188
and I will come back to it
because we have to get it

00:44:10.188 --> 00:44:12.577
ratified,
which is part of what we're

00:44:12.577 --> 00:44:14.230
going to do on Tuesday.
 

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:19.264
But in the interest of time:
on September 16,1787,

00:44:19.264 --> 00:44:22.860
the Constitution was agreed
upon.

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.445
On September 17,
it was signed and sent to the

00:44:26.445 --> 00:44:31.228
Confederation Congress to pass
along to the individual states

00:44:31.228 --> 00:44:33.860
so that they could ratify it.
 

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.608
And there needed to be nine
states to ratify the

00:44:37.608 --> 00:44:40.880
Constitution for it to go into
effect,

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.090
and each state would have its
own ratifying convention to

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:45.179
decide the issue.
 

00:44:45.179 --> 00:44:46.409
So what we're going to be
looking at,

00:44:46.409 --> 00:44:50.492
at least at the beginning of
next Tuesday's lecture is this

00:44:50.492 --> 00:44:52.817
second debate,
which is: what do we really

00:44:52.817 --> 00:44:54.070
think about the Constitution?
 

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:57.208
And part of what we'll be
pulling from that is,

00:44:57.208 --> 00:45:01.369
what kind of a sort of status
check does it show us about what

00:45:01.369 --> 00:45:04.030
Americans are thinking at the
time?

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:06.485
In what way do the different
arguments for and against tell

00:45:06.485 --> 00:45:08.349
us something about America at
that moment?

00:45:08.349 --> 00:45:11.590
So we'll see the sort of highly
contested debate.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.829
We'll see states that say no
and then say yes.

00:45:14.829 --> 00:45:17.949
Rhode Island is still over here
somewhere waiting to see what

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:18.469
happens.
 

00:45:18.469 --> 00:45:21.900
And it's really something that
people are watching closely.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.639
I'll talk a little bit more
about this on Tuesday,

00:45:24.639 --> 00:45:27.099
but I once again also turn to
Ezra Stiles.

00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:30.427
I'm basically always looking
for something that makes this

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:32.822
real, so that it's not just:
the document,

00:45:32.822 --> 00:45:34.750
the debate, the Constitution.
 

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.496
So Ezra Stiles' diary--I love
Ezra Stiles' diary,

00:45:37.496 --> 00:45:40.360
so I'll mention it a little bit
more on Tuesday.

00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.237
But he talks about what he
thinks about what's going on,

00:45:44.237 --> 00:45:48.539
and he talks about watching
states ratify the Constitution.

00:45:48.539 --> 00:45:50.695
I'll mention some of that as
well, because it again,

00:45:50.695 --> 00:45:53.233
shows one guy that's kind of
responding to what's going on in

00:45:53.233 --> 00:45:54.460
a really interesting way.
 

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:55.429
I will stop there.
 

00:45:55.429 --> 00:45:57.570
I will see you on Tuesday.
 

00:45:57.570 --> 00:45:58.590
Have a good weekend.
 

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:04.000

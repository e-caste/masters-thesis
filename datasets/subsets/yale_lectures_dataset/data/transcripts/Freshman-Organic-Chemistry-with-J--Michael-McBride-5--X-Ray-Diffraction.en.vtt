00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.379
Prof: So as we ended
last time, we said despite

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.970
Earnshaw,
which says you can't have these

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.113
Lewis structures,
might there really

00:00:10.113 --> 00:00:13.100
be shared-pair
bonds and lone-pairs,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.355
and how do we know;
we have to look,

00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:16.000
or feel.
 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.413
So last time we tried feeling
with scanning probe microscopy

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:21.910
-- AFM, STM, SNOM.
 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.220
They're really great.
 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.519
You can see atoms;
you can see molecules,

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.200
but you can't see bonds.
 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.740
Okay, so what's the key word
here?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.890
Students:  Lux.
 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.700
Prof: Lux, right?
 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.490
So maybe we'll see it,
if we can't feel it.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.749
Now this is the entrance to
this building,

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.560
the old delivery entrance out
on Prospect Street.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.150
And you know there's
interesting stuff all over the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.720
building.
 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.120
Up here on top there's a fluted
filter paper and a funnel,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.848
but hidden back in the shadows
is something that's a little

00:00:59.848 --> 00:01:03.734
surprising to you,
back there, which is a

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:04.920
microscope.
 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.920
What science do you associate
that with?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.890
Students:  Biology.
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.908
Prof: Biology,
not chemistry,

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:10.370
right?
 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.480
What's it doing?
 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.799
Well at least it's back in the
shadows there.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.167
But maybe the eyeball up there
says we can see the things we

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:21.129
can't feel.
 

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:22.269
Okay?
 

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:25.720
This is a picture -- does
anybody recognize this?

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.629
Student:  Flea.
 

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:29.400
Prof: You know what it's
from?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.688
Student: Bubonic plague?
 

00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:33.303
Prof: It's from Robert
Hooke's great book,

00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:35.099
Micrographia,
from 1665.

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:36.209
It's a wonderful book.
 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:38.870
The page is about this big.
 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.370
And imagine the person who had
fleas, seeing that for the first

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.879
time.
 

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:46.890
It's exquisite, this drawing.
 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.081
And he said in the book:
"But Nature is not to be

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:52.700
limited by our narrow
comprehension;

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.891
future improvements of glasses
may yet further enlighten our

00:01:56.891 --> 00:01:59.928
understanding,
and ocular inspection may

00:01:59.928 --> 00:02:04.608
demonstrate that which as yet we
may think too extravagant either

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:06.950
to feign or to suppose."
 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.907
So if he had a microscope that
could do that in 1665,

00:02:11.907 --> 00:02:17.437
we must have a microscope now
that's powerful enough to see

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:19.060
bonds, right?
 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.470
And in fact we do.
 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.876
In fact, there's a brand new
one that they promise will come

00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:31.650
online next Tuesday in a room
about 100 yards over that way,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.851
and the trick it uses is the
same one Newton used to measure

00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:41.258
the distance of the air gap for
Newton's rings,

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:44.500
or that Hooke explained by the
pulses, right?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.538
And it's interference that
comes from scattering.

00:02:48.538 --> 00:02:52.871
So you've seen oil on water,
thin layers of oil on water,

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:55.270
and you see rainbows in them.
 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.479
Why?
 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:00.620
Okay, so light comes in and
scatters from two surfaces,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.840
that let's say are 200
nanometers apart.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.889
Okay?
 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.012
So the path difference between
the one that reflects from the

00:03:08.012 --> 00:03:10.354
top and the one that reflects
from the bottom,

00:03:10.354 --> 00:03:12.280
the difference is 400
nanometers;

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.110
one goes 400 nanometers further
than the other.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.590
Now suppose that happened to be
one wavelength.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.800
Right?
 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.433
Then if that purple light that
came in, one going further than

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:29.688
the other, they would come out
exactly one wave apart.

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:32.736
So it would be as if it were a
single wave and they would

00:03:32.736 --> 00:03:36.220
reinforce one another and you'd
see the purple light strongly.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.860
Okay?
 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.973
But if the wavelength
difference were half -- if the

00:03:41.973 --> 00:03:47.888
path difference were half the
wavelength, like for red light

00:03:47.888 --> 00:03:50.060
--
Oh-oh.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.598
What do we do here, Elaine?
 

00:03:51.598 --> 00:04:00.050
Better get it quick,
before something comes up.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.080
You're a good sport.
 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:14.330
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.870
OK.
 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.240
Thank you.
 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:22.283
Prof: If it's one
wavelength path difference,

00:04:22.283 --> 00:04:27.199
then it reinforces and we get a
nice strong wave coming out.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.170
Okay?
 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.310
But if it's half-a-wavelength
difference, like for the red

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.199
light, then they cancel.
 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.055
One is a maximum when the other
is a minimum,

00:04:37.055 --> 00:04:38.290
and they're zero.
 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.860
Okay?
 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.060
So you get no scattering.
 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.970
So that's why you get different
colors, because the oil is

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.829
different thicknesses in
different parts of the slick.

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:48.387
Okay, so here's the new machine
that's right over here that's

00:04:48.387 --> 00:04:50.389
supposed to come on -- new
machines actually;

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.319
there are two of them;
it was a package deal.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.242
And that's Chris Incarvito
who's the director of the

00:04:56.242 --> 00:04:59.855
Chemical Instrumentation Center
and the proud owner of these two

00:04:59.855 --> 00:05:00.829
new machines.
 

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:04.459
So the one he's looking at
there is a user -- is to be

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:05.829
operated by users.
 

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:10.050
So it's just you sort of push
buttons and you get where the

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.560
atoms are in the molecule -- at
least that's the hope -- and it

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.379
costs about $200,000.
 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:19.302
Okay, so there's a little
thread there that has a crystal

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:21.810
on, but you need a magnifying
glass to see it.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.779
You won't see it with your eyes;
it's a tiny, tiny crystal.

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:25.480
Okay?
 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.379
So here's an x-ray tube.
 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.567
X-rays come down the pipe
there, hit the crystal and get

00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:35.449
scattered, and are detected by
this CCD detector.

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.389
Okay?
 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.547
And then from that information,
those scattered rays,

00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.339
you get where the atoms are in
the molecule;

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:44.038
more precisely,
as you'll see,

00:05:44.038 --> 00:05:47.610
where the electrons are in the
molecule, or in the crystal.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.449
The other machine that he's
especially proud of costs $350K.

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.600
And why is it more expensive?
 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.240
Because it collects more.
 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.553
Instead of using that little
disc of a CCD,

00:05:59.553 --> 00:06:01.920
it has a curved image plate.
 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.490
Right?
 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.322
So when the x-rays come down
here and hit the tiny crystal,

00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:09.430
many more of them get collected
by the plate.

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.620
So it's more efficient.
 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.819
So those will be coming soon.
 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.170
And if all you have to do is
press a button and the structure

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.790
comes out, that seems fine.
 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.420
But that's not the goal of this
course, to press a button.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.769
We want to understand how such
a thing works.

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:32.634
Seeing individual molecules,
atoms, and maybe bonds,

00:06:32.634 --> 00:06:38.500
there's a problem,
and the problem is wavelength.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.170
Because you know in principle
you can't resolve things that

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:47.360
are closer together than the
wavelength of light,

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.995
and the wavelength of light
we've been talking about here is

00:06:50.995 --> 00:06:52.290
400-800 nanometers.
 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.430
Whereas what's the distance of
a carbon-carbon bond?

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.699
Anybody remember?
 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:57.699
Student:  1.86.
 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:00.139
Prof: One and a half
angstroms, right?

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.910
So three orders of magnitude
smaller than the wavelength of

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:04.430
light.
 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.932
So this is a problem,
and it's why,

00:07:06.932 --> 00:07:09.065
as you'll see,
you use x-rays,

00:07:09.065 --> 00:07:12.009
because they have short
wavelengths.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.480
Now to understand this we'd
have to know what light is.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.180
So what is light?
 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.399
You people have studied physics
and so on.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.819
So what's light? Wilson?
 

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:24.449
Student:  Who knows?
 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.740
Prof: Who knows, okay.
 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.259
Student:  An
electromagnetic wave.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:30.720
Prof: It's an
electromagnetic wave.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.620
Okay.
 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:38.975
Now I've seen -- indeed it is
-- I've seen waves on the ocean,

00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:39.940
right?
 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:43.283
Does it mean that
electromagnetic waves are like

00:07:43.283 --> 00:07:44.279
those waves?
 

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:48.620
In what way is an
electromagnetic wave a wave?

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.370
What's wavy about it?
 

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.963
Well you can make a graph
that's a wave,

00:07:54.963 --> 00:07:56.990
that involves light.
 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:02.170
So here what we're going to
plot is the force on a charge.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.459
The charge is at a particular
position.

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:07.170
We'll have the charge over
there on the right;

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.951
it's fixed there,
and we're going to measure the

00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:13.029
force on it that'll make it
accelerate up or down.

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:17.329
Okay?
 

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:21.019
Oops.
 

00:08:21.019 --> 00:08:24.269
It doesn't work quite the way
it does on mine.

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:27.139
Please let me know when that
happens.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:29.819
No maybe it's going to work.
 

00:08:29.819 --> 00:08:32.639
&gt;
 

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:34.952
What that first thing did was
went up and down,

00:08:34.952 --> 00:08:36.309
up and down,
up and down.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:37.418
Okay?
 

00:08:37.418 --> 00:08:41.101
But if you plot it then as a
function of time,

00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:42.082
it's a wave.
 

00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:42.820
Right?
 

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.417
The field, at a particular
point, as a function of time,

00:08:47.417 --> 00:08:48.418
is a wave.
 

00:08:48.418 --> 00:08:52.288
It goes up and down and up and
down.

00:08:52.288 --> 00:08:56.687
Okay, now so we plot the field,
or the force on a charge at one

00:08:56.687 --> 00:08:59.029
position as a function of time.
 

00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:03.768
But there's another way of
making a plot that also shows

00:09:03.768 --> 00:09:07.644
light as a wave,
which is to show the field at

00:09:07.644 --> 00:09:10.919
different places at the same
time.

00:09:10.919 --> 00:09:11.350
Right?
 

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.101
So we're going to change it and
now the horizontal axis is the

00:09:15.101 --> 00:09:17.808
position but it's at a
particular instant.

00:09:17.808 --> 00:09:21.658
So as the thing goes along
there are different forces at

00:09:21.658 --> 00:09:23.620
different positions,
okay?

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.190
And again, that will be a wave.
 

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.470
So that's the sense in which
light is a wave.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.460
And what is it that we're
plotting?

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.279
We're plotting the electric
field.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:38.894
So light is associated with an
electric field that goes up and

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:39.309
down.
 

00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:40.200
Right?
 

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.408
And you can plot it in time or
in space and get a wave.

00:09:44.408 --> 00:09:47.389
So that's the sense in which
it's a wave.

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:49.399
It's also, incidentally,
a magnetic field;

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:50.840
it's electromagnetic.
 

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.320
Maxwell dealt with things like
that.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.815
And there's a magnetic field
perpendicular to the electric

00:09:55.815 --> 00:09:58.004
field,
but we don't care about it,

00:09:58.004 --> 00:10:01.328
at least not until next
semester when we talk about

00:10:01.328 --> 00:10:05.183
nuclear magnetic resonance,
because the electric field is

00:10:05.183 --> 00:10:07.970
so much stronger in its effect
on molecules.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:13.832
Now, its effect is on charges;
on electrons,

00:10:13.832 --> 00:10:18.210
on protons, therefore on
nuclei.

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.980
Now, accelerated electrons
scatter light.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.240
So here comes the light in.
 

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:28.330
We'll see if this works.
 

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:32.438
Okay, so it makes the electron
go up and down,

00:10:32.438 --> 00:10:34.538
as the light goes by.
 

00:10:34.538 --> 00:10:38.485
But up and down moving of
electrons, accelerating

00:10:38.485 --> 00:10:42.759
electrons, is what
creates electric fields.

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:43.320
Right?
 

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.635
That's what an antenna is,
is electrons moving back and

00:10:45.635 --> 00:10:45.980
forth.
 

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.120
So when the original light
comes through and hits the

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.840
electron and makes it vibrate up
and down,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.129
that electron vibrating emits
radiation,

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:58.538
electromagnetic radiation,
in all directions;

00:10:58.538 --> 00:11:01.927
all directions except this
direction, and stronger the more

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:05.083
you're perpendicular to the
direction it's going up and

00:11:05.083 --> 00:11:05.610
down.
 

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.428
But anyhow it scatters the
light.

00:11:07.428 --> 00:11:11.076
So most of the light still goes
through the direct beam,

00:11:11.076 --> 00:11:13.730
but a little bit of it gets
scattered;

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.696
much less would be scattered --
a single electron wouldn't

00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:19.437
scatter very much,
you'd need lots of electrons to

00:11:19.437 --> 00:11:23.519
scatter a lot,
and they have to be cooperating.

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:25.629
Okay?
 

00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:28.846
Now you tell me,
why are we interested in

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:31.178
electrons scattering light?
 

00:11:31.178 --> 00:11:34.649
There are just as many protons
in a sample as there are

00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:35.418
electrons.
 

00:11:35.418 --> 00:11:38.240
Why don't we worry about the
protons scattering light?

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.759
Student:  Electrons are
a lot less massive.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:41.529
Prof: So what?
 

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:44.139
Student:  They move a
lot more easily.

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:46.070
Prof: Ah,
the electrons are what moves.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.340
You need the moving charge to
generate the scattered light.

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:54.231
The lightest positive charged
things are -- of normal

00:11:54.231 --> 00:11:58.841
particles -- are a thousand
times heavier than the

00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:00.159
electrons.
 

00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:00.940
So they don't move very much.
 

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.570
It's the electrons that scatter
the light.

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:06.227
So with x-rays,
you see electrons,

00:12:06.227 --> 00:12:07.669
not nuclei.
 

00:12:07.669 --> 00:12:10.370
Okay, they're too heavy.
 

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:15.038
Now then, but you need a lot of
electrons to scatter enough to

00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:17.639
see, and they have to cooperate.
 

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:18.350
Right?
 

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.960
So here we have ripples on a
pond;

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.789
you've all seen that kind of
thing with a little bit of rain

00:12:24.789 --> 00:12:25.440
falling.
 

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:28.211
And so suppose you had two
spots that are generating

00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:30.871
ripples,
two electrons let's say,

00:12:30.871 --> 00:12:34.308
and they give off circular
waves here,

00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:36.452
in two dimensions,
and they interfere with one

00:12:36.452 --> 00:12:36.928
another.
 

00:12:36.928 --> 00:12:39.730
But you can see a pattern is
emerging,

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.840
and when you're very,
very far away from these,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.460
compared to the distance
between the electrons,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.162
as indeed you are in these
samples we're talking about

00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:50.273
where you have an infinitesimal
crystal and the detector plate

00:12:50.273 --> 00:12:52.159
is a substantial distance away
--

00:12:52.159 --> 00:12:52.558
right?
 

00:12:52.558 --> 00:12:54.908
-- the electrons are really
close to one another.

00:12:54.908 --> 00:12:57.019
So you're way,
way, way far away on the scale

00:12:57.019 --> 00:12:58.940
of the distance between the
electrons.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.389
Okay?
 

00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:05.123
And now you can see what
pattern there is for high points

00:13:05.123 --> 00:13:07.490
and low points,
for waves.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.240
Okay?
 

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.918
Because you can see here that
there's a pattern like that,

00:13:11.918 --> 00:13:13.789
that goes along the maxima.
 

00:13:13.789 --> 00:13:16.028
Everybody see that?
 

00:13:16.028 --> 00:13:18.908
And halfway in between those
dashed yellow lines,

00:13:18.908 --> 00:13:21.779
there's no change at all;
nothing's happening there.

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:23.278
Right?
 

00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:25.509
And if you go out very,
very far away,

00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:28.719
you can see that asymptotically
these approach these straight

00:13:28.719 --> 00:13:31.178
lines that originate between the
electrons,

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:34.230
or on the crystal in a real
case.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:40.309
So what you have coming out of
the crystal are straight rays of

00:13:40.309 --> 00:13:42.370
light, x-ray light.
 

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.210
Okay?
 

00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:49.019
And the angles at which they
come out depend on where the

00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:50.678
electrons are.
 

00:13:50.678 --> 00:13:53.072
If the electrons are closer
together or further apart or

00:13:53.072 --> 00:13:55.553
displaced in this direction,
you'll get different patterns

00:13:55.553 --> 00:13:56.379
of the ripples.
 

00:13:56.379 --> 00:14:01.038
So somehow it must be possible,
or there must be a connection

00:14:01.038 --> 00:14:05.543
between the positions of the
electrons and where these rays

00:14:05.543 --> 00:14:07.019
are coming out.
 

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:08.080
Right?
 

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.909
And if you can go backwards,
to go from where the rays come

00:14:12.909 --> 00:14:17.490
out, to where the electrons
were, then you've solved the

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:18.490
problem.
 

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:19.210
Right?
 

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.039
You're not creating an image,
the way you would with a normal

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:23.870
microscope.
 

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.658
You're trying to interpret the
scattering.

00:14:28.658 --> 00:14:31.471
So the angular intensity
distribution,

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:34.663
at great distance,
depends on the scatterer

00:14:34.663 --> 00:14:39.470
distribution at the origin;
that is, in the crystal.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.241
Now, if you have normal light,
and a lens like Hooke's

00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:47.370
microscope, then you can use
these lenses to refocus it.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.629
So the same information is
coming out.

00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:54.615
The sample there is emitting
these rays, but a lens collects

00:14:54.615 --> 00:14:59.855
them and refocuses them to make
an enlarged image that you then

00:14:59.855 --> 00:15:00.870
observe.
 

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.370
The problem is that you can't
do that with x-rays.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.804
People are making efforts now,
with nanofabrication kind of

00:15:09.804 --> 00:15:12.428
things,
to make things that will act

00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:15.793
like lenses for x-rays,
and they've made some steps,

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:19.628
but nothing like you would need
to actually observe electrons in

00:15:19.628 --> 00:15:20.419
a crystal.
 

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:21.240
Okay?
 

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.315
Be sure to read -- there's a
webpage -- have some of you read

00:15:24.315 --> 00:15:24.928
it so far?
 

00:15:24.928 --> 00:15:27.072
-- that has to do with what I'm
lecturing on now,

00:15:27.072 --> 00:15:28.679
which will help you a lot I
think;

00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:31.129
so look for that.
 

00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:34.325
So we're interested in seeing
molecules, atoms,

00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:37.658
bonds, collectively,
by x-ray crystallography.

00:15:37.658 --> 00:15:42.902
That is, we're not seeing the
image of individual electrons,

00:15:42.902 --> 00:15:47.344
we're seeing the scattering
that comes from all the

00:15:47.344 --> 00:15:50.009
electrons acting together.
 

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:54.244
So we're not seeing them one at
a time, we're seeing something

00:15:54.244 --> 00:15:55.908
collective about them.
 

00:15:55.908 --> 00:15:57.990
So that, for example,
a real sample,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.908
or a sort of fake sample,
of benzene,

00:16:00.908 --> 00:16:03.168
which had a bunch of -- six
carbon atoms in a ring,

00:16:03.168 --> 00:16:05.418
might look like this at any
given time.

00:16:05.418 --> 00:16:10.235
It's sort of regular but things
are a little bit one way or the

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:12.490
other, vibrating and so on.
 

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:15.957
Now you wouldn't see this in
x-ray, because everything is

00:16:15.957 --> 00:16:18.250
cooperating in what you're
getting.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.683
You'd see some sort of average
of all of them,

00:16:20.683 --> 00:16:23.659
and it would be a little bit
smeared because of that.

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:24.710
Right?
 

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:27.570
You don't see -- with scanning
probe microscopy,

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.197
with these sharp tips,
you actually can feel

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:32.606
individual atoms,
and if one atom is someplace

00:16:32.606 --> 00:16:35.309
else, you'll see it,
or feel it there.

00:16:35.309 --> 00:16:36.429
That's not true in x-ray.
 

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:38.690
You see an averaged structure.
 

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.190
And it's averaged in two ways.
 

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.629
There's blurring,
from motion and from defects.

00:16:43.629 --> 00:16:45.830
There's one benzene molecule
missing there.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:49.589
It's time-averaged because it
took you time to collect these,

00:16:49.589 --> 00:16:50.779
this information.
 

00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:54.519
With synchrotrons and really,
really intense beams,

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:57.658
people are trying to get faster
and faster data collection,

00:16:57.658 --> 00:17:01.255
but still what you see is
time-averaged on the scale of

00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:04.118
how fast atoms are moving in
your sample.

00:17:04.118 --> 00:17:05.788
So it's time-averaged,
what you get.

00:17:05.788 --> 00:17:09.608
And it's also space-averaged,
right?

00:17:09.608 --> 00:17:11.699
It's as if you put them all on
top of one another,

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:14.130
that's what you would see,
but some are displaced a little

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:15.579
one way, the other,
and so on.

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:16.400
So it's a little fuzzy.
 

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.150
Okay?
 

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:22.425
And this is an advantage for
scanning probe microscopy,

00:17:22.425 --> 00:17:25.702
which operates in real space,
actually feels individual

00:17:25.702 --> 00:17:26.368
things.
 

00:17:26.368 --> 00:17:30.259
Okay, so x-rays were discovered
in 1895 by Röntgen,

00:17:30.259 --> 00:17:33.299
using Crookes' tube that we
talked about.

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:33.710
Okay?
 

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.007
And he took a picture of his
wife's hand there,

00:17:37.007 --> 00:17:39.660
Frau Röentgen's hand,
in 1896.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.611
But what he sees is not a
picture that you can blow up,

00:17:43.611 --> 00:17:47.490
like with a microscope,
because it's just a shadow.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:52.130
All the bones do is stop the
x-rays that are going through.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.930
So you don't get something
that's enlarged.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.480
Right?
 

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.974
You're not going to be able to
use it the way you use medical

00:17:57.974 --> 00:17:58.349
x-rays.
 

00:17:58.349 --> 00:18:00.970
Okay.
 

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:07.269
But in 1912 Max von Laue
invented x-ray diffraction,

00:18:07.269 --> 00:18:09.200
which is this scattering and
detect --

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.269
not trying to focus things,
not using a shadow,

00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:15.220
but looking at these rays that
come out and trying to figure

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:18.327
out from them,
something about what the atoms

00:18:18.327 --> 00:18:18.778
were.
 

00:18:18.778 --> 00:18:20.828
And that's his diffraction
picture.

00:18:20.828 --> 00:18:23.806
That's what you'd see on that
-- remember there was that round

00:18:23.806 --> 00:18:25.710
CCD plate that's on this new
machine?

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.660
You might get a pattern that
looked sort of like that.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.210
That was copper sulfate in 1912.
 

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:36.644
But the real breakthrough by
was William Lawrence Bragg,

00:18:36.644 --> 00:18:38.500
who was 22 years old.
 

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.877
He had just graduated from
Cambridge University when he

00:18:41.877 --> 00:18:45.317
determined the structure of a
crystal using Laue's x-ray

00:18:45.317 --> 00:18:46.818
diffraction pattern.
 

00:18:46.818 --> 00:18:50.931
So he figured out how to go the
other way, to go from the

00:18:50.931 --> 00:18:55.115
x-ray's scattered pattern to
what the atoms were that were

00:18:55.115 --> 00:18:56.069
doing it.
 

00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:57.048
Right?
 

00:18:57.048 --> 00:19:00.748
And he did this in 1912 when he
was 22-years-old,

00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:03.598
and he got the Nobel Prize in
1915.

00:19:03.598 --> 00:19:05.920
He's still the youngest Nobel
Laureate.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.798
Right?
 

00:19:06.798 --> 00:19:09.130
His son gave me permission to
use this picture.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.410
He's a very nice guy,
lives in Cambridge.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.009
Okay, then of course we've come
a long way from that.

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:19.834
I think you probably recognize
this picture,

00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:20.359
right?
 

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:22.660
What is it?
 

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:24.150
Prof: It's the
scattering from DNA.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:26.380
Is it a picture of DNA?
 

00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.670
Students:  No.
 

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.730
Prof: No it's not a
double helix.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:33.492
What it is, is the way x-rays
come out when they hit the

00:19:33.492 --> 00:19:34.519
double helix.
 

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:34.780
Okay?
 

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.599
And you have to figure
backwards, and that's what Crick

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:40.458
was able to do;
and we'll discuss how he did

00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:40.868
that.
 

00:19:40.868 --> 00:19:45.980
Okay, so that's 1952,40 years
after Bragg's discovery.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.940
And then just in 2000,
not so long ago,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.977
this has gone to the complete
structure of the ribosome at 2.4

00:19:53.977 --> 00:19:57.467
angstroms resolution,
which was done here at Yale,

00:19:57.467 --> 00:19:59.618
in this building and the next
building.

00:19:59.618 --> 00:20:01.528
Okay, and that's what it looks
like.

00:20:01.528 --> 00:20:05.261
It has twenty-five nanometers
across, 250 angstroms,

00:20:05.261 --> 00:20:07.970
as long as whatever number that
is;

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.339
lots of carbon-carbon bonds.
 

00:20:10.339 --> 00:20:11.680
And you see all those atoms.
 

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.663
There are greater than 100,000
atoms, not counting the

00:20:14.663 --> 00:20:15.338
hydrogens.
 

00:20:15.338 --> 00:20:19.684
Incidentally,
why is it easier to see other

00:20:19.684 --> 00:20:22.788
atoms than to see hydrogens?
 

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:24.890
Student:  They have
never counted them.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.808
Prof: Because that's
where the electrons are.

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:29.009
Hydrogens come with only one
electron.

00:20:29.009 --> 00:20:31.279
Other atoms come with lots of
electrons.

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:34.988
So it's hard to see hydrogens;
much easier to see the other

00:20:34.988 --> 00:20:35.640
things.
 

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.259
Okay, now what can electron
diffraction show,

00:20:38.259 --> 00:20:39.750
x-ray diffraction show?
 

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:41.380
That's what we want to know.
 

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.619
Can it show molecules?
 

00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:43.400
Yes.
 

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.680
Can it show atoms?
 

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.700
Apparently;
I just showed you a picture.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.614
But what we really want to know
is whether it can show bonds and

00:20:51.614 --> 00:20:53.230
whether Lewis was right.
 

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.575
So to understand this,
we have to know how diffraction

00:20:56.575 --> 00:20:57.078
works.
 

00:20:57.078 --> 00:20:59.803
I mean, you could just be like
the people that will go and

00:20:59.803 --> 00:21:02.384
punch the button on that
machine, but that's not what I

00:21:02.384 --> 00:21:04.200
think you would be satisfied
with.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.490
So I'll help you out.
 

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:09.859
So like all light,
x-rays are waves;

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:12.220
they just are very short.
 

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:19.948
So now I'm going to demonstrate
with a machine here,

00:21:19.948 --> 00:21:26.615
which was designed for an
overhead projector,

00:21:26.615 --> 00:21:32.980
but I believe it's going to
work here.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.460
Okay, so here are our waves.
 

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:42.569
Okay, so here's a wave coming
in.

00:21:42.569 --> 00:21:43.240
Okay?
 

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.608
And when it gets to this
position, it hits an electron

00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:50.259
here and an electron here;
forget this one for now.

00:21:50.259 --> 00:21:51.950
Okay, everybody got me?
 

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.297
At a given time,
these two electrons are being

00:21:55.297 --> 00:21:57.851
pushed up;
then they're going to be pushed

00:21:57.851 --> 00:21:59.460
down, as this wave passes by.
 

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.565
Okay, now as those two get
pushed up and down,

00:22:02.565 --> 00:22:05.809
they give off waves in almost
all directions;

00:22:05.809 --> 00:22:08.640
all directions for our purposes.
 

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.269
So they give off waves in all
different directions.

00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:12.130
Right?
 

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:16.113
Now notice the one,
the part of that scattered

00:22:16.113 --> 00:22:19.298
x-ray that goes straight
forward,

00:22:19.298 --> 00:22:22.160
in the same direction the
original light came in,

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.559
is bound to be in-phase with
one another.

00:22:25.559 --> 00:22:26.130
Right?
 

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:29.840
And we can test that with this
line here, because if they're

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:33.489
going right straight ahead,
this one is a maximum when this

00:22:33.489 --> 00:22:34.809
one is a maximum.
 

00:22:34.809 --> 00:22:36.220
Everybody with me on that?
 

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.058
And it'll keep that.
 

00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:40.003
So you'll get scattering by
both of them cooperating,

00:22:40.003 --> 00:22:41.930
coming out of it straight
ahead.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.130
But how about if it's at an
angle?

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.970
Okay, so I can push this up and
change the angle.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:51.434
How about at that angle,
how much light is going to be

00:22:51.434 --> 00:22:53.920
coming out from these two
electrons?

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.890
Student:  None.
 

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.374
Prof: None,
they exactly cancel each other,

00:22:57.374 --> 00:22:57.779
right?
 

00:22:57.779 --> 00:23:01.926
But if I go to this angle,
now they're just as strong as

00:23:01.926 --> 00:23:04.190
they were originally,
right?

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.798
And then it'll go weak,
weak, weak, weaker,

00:23:06.798 --> 00:23:08.765
weakest, nothing;
then stronger,

00:23:08.765 --> 00:23:11.066
stronger, stronger,
stronger, very strong,

00:23:11.066 --> 00:23:12.749
weaker, weaker,
weaker, weaker,

00:23:12.749 --> 00:23:13.759
weaker, zero.
 

00:23:13.759 --> 00:23:16.503
So there'll be a modulation --
as you go out at different

00:23:16.503 --> 00:23:18.827
angles here,
going either up or down,

00:23:18.827 --> 00:23:20.906
it'll be strong,
then nothing,

00:23:20.906 --> 00:23:22.819
then strong,
then nothing,

00:23:22.819 --> 00:23:24.180
strong then nothing.
 

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:25.108
Right?
 

00:23:25.108 --> 00:23:30.968
So now what will determine,
what will determine how

00:23:30.968 --> 00:23:38.349
frequently these angles recur,
at which reinforcement occurs?

00:23:38.349 --> 00:23:40.940
Is that clear, the question?
 

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.880
What determines the angles?
 

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.299
Yeah -- pardon me?
 

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:45.170
Student:  The wavelength.
 

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.818
Prof: Ah,
obviously the wavelength.

00:23:46.818 --> 00:23:49.450
What if the wavelength were
very, very, very short?

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:50.818
Student: Lots of angles.
 

00:23:50.818 --> 00:23:52.048
Prof: Then you'd get
lots of them.

00:23:52.048 --> 00:23:54.417
You wouldn't have to do it very
much before the next one came

00:23:54.417 --> 00:23:56.314
in, if they were very -- what
else determines it,

00:23:56.314 --> 00:23:57.380
besides the wavelength.
 

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.078
Yes John?
 

00:23:58.078 --> 00:23:59.750
Student:  The distance
between the two of them.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:00.608
Prof: The distance.
 

00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:02.460
That's what we're really
interested in,

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.391
is using this;
knowing the wavelength of the

00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:08.359
x-rays, using this to measure
distance.

00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:09.180
Okay?
 

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.619
Now let's forget the one on the
bottom here.

00:24:11.619 --> 00:24:13.009
Let's put this one in.
 

00:24:13.009 --> 00:24:15.028
Okay?
 

00:24:15.028 --> 00:24:18.493
Now -- oh okay,
for reference let's look at the

00:24:18.493 --> 00:24:19.848
bottom a second.
 

00:24:19.848 --> 00:24:24.742
So the first reinforcement came
here, between the top one and

00:24:24.742 --> 00:24:26.130
the bottom one.
 

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:27.578
Everybody with me?
 

00:24:27.578 --> 00:24:30.359
How about for the top one and
the middle one,

00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:32.318
where did the first one come?
 

00:24:32.318 --> 00:24:34.661
You had to go to a higher
angle, there,

00:24:34.661 --> 00:24:37.990
to get reinforcement between
the top and the middle.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:38.740
Right?
 

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:45.796
So the closer things are
together, the fewer the angles

00:24:45.796 --> 00:24:46.579
are.
 

00:24:46.579 --> 00:24:48.368
Everybody with me on that?
 

00:24:48.368 --> 00:24:50.980
Notice that's a reciprocal
relationship.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.601
The closer things are in what
we call 'real space,' the

00:24:54.601 --> 00:24:58.692
distance between the electrons,
the further apart are the rays

00:24:58.692 --> 00:25:00.569
that come out,
in angle.

00:25:00.569 --> 00:25:01.130
Okay?
 

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:02.598
So it's backwards.
 

00:25:02.598 --> 00:25:04.730
Closer together,
further apart,

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.430
in what's called 'reciprocal
space.'

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:12.731
Okay, now suppose you had a
whole row of electrons that were

00:25:12.731 --> 00:25:14.170
evenly spaced.
 

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.670
Okay?
 

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.068
So here's the first,
the second, the third.

00:25:19.068 --> 00:25:20.609
Now we'll take all three of
them.

00:25:20.609 --> 00:25:21.009
Right?
 

00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:24.597
And what you notice is that as
we go out it gets weaker,

00:25:24.597 --> 00:25:26.556
weaker, weaker,
weaker, weaker,

00:25:26.556 --> 00:25:28.838
weaker, weaker,
weaker, weaker.

00:25:28.838 --> 00:25:33.952
Now when we get to the angle
here, where the first and the

00:25:33.952 --> 00:25:37.990
third were very strong,
what do we see now?

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:40.420
The one in the middle cancels
the first one,

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.328
and if it were a very long row
of them,

00:25:43.328 --> 00:25:47.396
the fourth one would -- here
the second one cancels the first

00:25:47.396 --> 00:25:49.467
one --
the fourth would cancel the

00:25:49.467 --> 00:25:51.675
third,
the sixth would cancel the

00:25:51.675 --> 00:25:53.950
fifth, and so on,
and you wouldn't get anything.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:54.640
Right?
 

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.690
But then you'd get it again
when you got to the second.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:02.133
The one that would've been the
second angle,

00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:05.655
if it was just one and three,
will be strong,

00:26:05.655 --> 00:26:10.059
because this one halfway in
between will reinforce.

00:26:10.059 --> 00:26:10.308
Right?
 

00:26:10.308 --> 00:26:11.818
So closer together,
further apart.

00:26:11.818 --> 00:26:15.259
And if you have a whole row of
equally spaced things,

00:26:15.259 --> 00:26:18.502
they'll all be together,
according to whatever the

00:26:18.502 --> 00:26:21.150
distance between successive ones
is.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:22.210
Yes, Shai?
 

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.781
Student:  What are the
chances that electrons are going

00:26:24.781 --> 00:26:27.303
to be spaced evenly along --
Prof: Ah,

00:26:27.303 --> 00:26:31.549
what could cause electrons to
be spaced exactly evenly?

00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:32.309
Student:  A crystal.
 

00:26:32.309 --> 00:26:36.740
Prof: A crystal;
x-ray crystallography, right?

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.828
So that's why you use crystals.
 

00:26:39.828 --> 00:26:44.009
Okay, that's what we want to
say here, I think.

00:26:44.009 --> 00:27:04.970
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.470
Prof: Okay,
so that's the wave machine.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:09.118
And if you want to do it in the
privacy of your room,

00:27:09.118 --> 00:27:13.433
you can go to this website at
Stonybrook and download

00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:18.661
something that allows you to run
a Java applet that does sort of

00:27:18.661 --> 00:27:20.568
this kind of thing.
 

00:27:20.568 --> 00:27:23.617
This, if you blow it up in
there, the waves look sort of

00:27:23.617 --> 00:27:25.308
funny there,
at the atoms,

00:27:25.308 --> 00:27:28.682
and the reason is because
you're measuring the phase

00:27:28.682 --> 00:27:32.190
perpendicular to different
directions of the wave.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.025
That's just to help you out,
if you try this and have -- and

00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:37.519
are confused by that.
 

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:40.490
Okay, now there are -- so
suppose you have just an

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:45.640
arbitrary set of electrons,
and the waves coming in and

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.352
hitting them,
what directions will you get

00:27:49.352 --> 00:27:50.548
reinforcement in?
 

00:27:50.548 --> 00:27:54.945
Well there are two directions
that you're guaranteed,

00:27:54.945 --> 00:27:59.088
no matter what the spacing is,
and that's this.

00:27:59.088 --> 00:28:04.308
Here the light comes in and
goes out.

00:28:04.308 --> 00:28:08.348
So the direct beam,
you have the same path,

00:28:08.348 --> 00:28:11.450
because one of them gets hit
earlier,

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:14.953
but has a longer path coming
out, and the other one gets hit

00:28:14.953 --> 00:28:17.450
later but has a shorter path
coming out.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.538
So they're guaranteed to be
exactly in-phase if they're

00:28:20.538 --> 00:28:22.140
scattering straight ahead.
 

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.278
Okay?
 

00:28:23.278 --> 00:28:26.549
But only a little of the light
is getting scattered.

00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:28.108
Most of it is the direct beam.
 

00:28:28.108 --> 00:28:32.349
So you don't even notice the
difference, from that.

00:28:32.349 --> 00:28:34.288
So that's not very exciting.
 

00:28:34.288 --> 00:28:39.088
But there's another angle at
which you're sure that these two

00:28:39.088 --> 00:28:43.089
are going to be in-phase,
and that's this angle.

00:28:43.089 --> 00:28:48.328
Now how do we get to that angle?
 

00:28:48.328 --> 00:28:52.410
I've lost some of the -- since
you downloaded it there's some

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.108
more stuff in here now.
 

00:28:54.108 --> 00:28:57.088
But -- so now I can't quite
remember, let me just try.

00:28:57.088 --> 00:29:01.721
Okay, so this blue line here is
called the scattering vector,

00:29:01.721 --> 00:29:06.042
and that's how different the
arrow coming out is from the

00:29:06.042 --> 00:29:07.509
arrow going in.
 

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:08.990
Right?
 

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.839
That's just a funny
mathematical or geometric thing

00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:15.046
that people have defined;
they call it the scattering

00:29:15.046 --> 00:29:15.539
vector.
 

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:16.269
Right?
 

00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:21.348
Now this length is exactly the
same as that length.

00:29:21.348 --> 00:29:24.450
This length is exactly the same
as that length,

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:26.640
and when you turn at a given
angle,

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:29.489
those two will -- the vector
between those will be

00:29:29.489 --> 00:29:32.279
perpendicular to the direction
they're going,

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:33.829
and they'll be in-phase again.
 

00:29:33.829 --> 00:29:35.618
Right?
 

00:29:35.618 --> 00:29:40.240
And if you draw the line that
connects the two points,

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:45.558
notice the scattering vector is
perpendicular to that line.

00:29:45.558 --> 00:29:53.336
So you say that this incoming
wave was scattered perpendicular

00:29:53.336 --> 00:29:55.250
to this line.
 

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:57.009
That's how a mirror works.
 

00:29:57.009 --> 00:30:00.068
Right?
 

00:30:00.068 --> 00:30:04.364
That angle is called the
specular angle,

00:30:04.364 --> 00:30:09.500
because speculum is the
Latin word for mirror.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.019
Right?
 

00:30:12.019 --> 00:30:15.977
So you're bound to get
reinforcement at the specular

00:30:15.977 --> 00:30:20.400
angle, and you know that from
having looked at mirrors.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.077
Okay, now suppose there were
another electron on that same

00:30:25.077 --> 00:30:26.390
line or plane.
 

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.278
Okay?
 

00:30:27.278 --> 00:30:30.808
For the same reason it's
guaranteed to be in-phase.

00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:34.915
So everything on that plane
will scatter in-phase at that

00:30:34.915 --> 00:30:36.308
particular angle.
 

00:30:36.308 --> 00:30:38.529
They'll all reinforce one
another.

00:30:38.529 --> 00:30:40.558
Great.
 

00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:46.170
So all electrons on a plane
perpendicular to the scattering

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:50.910
vector, scatter in-phase at the
specular angle.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:53.873
Now suppose you have a whole
bunch of electrons and you have

00:30:53.873 --> 00:30:56.737
to figure out how they're going
to reinforce or cancel one

00:30:56.737 --> 00:30:57.339
another.
 

00:30:57.339 --> 00:30:59.410
There's a trick you can use.
 

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:05.868
You see if you can discern a
set of planes that are evenly

00:31:05.868 --> 00:31:10.288
spaced, that contain all,
or almost all,

00:31:10.288 --> 00:31:15.048
of the electrons you're
interested in.

00:31:15.048 --> 00:31:18.239
Okay, now if you look at this
pattern, you can see that

00:31:18.239 --> 00:31:20.542
there's a set of planes,
equally spaced,

00:31:20.542 --> 00:31:22.670
that passes through all of
them.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:24.319
Can you perceive it?
 

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:27.920
There.
 

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.163
Okay, there are three electrons
on the first plane,

00:31:30.163 --> 00:31:32.405
four on the second,
two on the third and one on the

00:31:32.405 --> 00:31:32.900
fourth.
 

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.470
Okay?
 

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:40.318
Now why is that handy?
 

00:31:40.318 --> 00:31:44.097
Okay, so there's the scattering
vector, perpendicular to these

00:31:44.097 --> 00:31:47.691
planes, and all the electrons on
any one plane will scatter

00:31:47.691 --> 00:31:49.548
in-phase with one another.
 

00:31:49.548 --> 00:31:53.721
Okay, so it's as if there were
a single electron three times

00:31:53.721 --> 00:31:55.856
bigger,
or four or two or one,

00:31:55.856 --> 00:31:59.069
on those successive planes,
because they're all going to be

00:31:59.069 --> 00:32:00.230
in-phase with one another.
 

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.403
So we could pretend they're all
at one point,

00:32:03.403 --> 00:32:04.920
on any given plane.
 

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.490
Okay?
 

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:09.836
So now all we have to worry
about is the phase relationship

00:32:09.836 --> 00:32:12.009
from one plane to the next.
 

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:14.528
Got that?
 

00:32:14.528 --> 00:32:17.618
If they were in-phase from one
plane to the next,

00:32:17.618 --> 00:32:20.744
as well as on the planes,
then everything will be

00:32:20.744 --> 00:32:24.717
in-phase and you'll get really
bright reflection coming out at

00:32:24.717 --> 00:32:26.410
that scattering angle.
 

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.318
Okay?
 

00:32:27.318 --> 00:32:31.324
Now, so let's think -- so it's
as if we had these collected

00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:35.327
electrons all lying on the
scattering vector and we want to

00:32:35.327 --> 00:32:38.848
know whether they're in-phase
with one another.

00:32:38.848 --> 00:32:42.846
Okay, so here's light that
comes in and out at a certain

00:32:42.846 --> 00:32:46.338
angle from the first one;
three electrons worth of

00:32:46.338 --> 00:32:49.336
scattering from that,
the ones that were on that

00:32:49.336 --> 00:32:50.420
plane -- okay?
 

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.130
-- and four from the second
plane.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.710
Now are the three and the four
in-phase with one another?

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:59.580
What condition would have to
apply in order for those to be

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.450
in-phase with one another?
 

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:06.630
They have different path
lengths, but if the paths differ

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.328
by an integral number of
wavelengths,

00:33:10.328 --> 00:33:13.410
then they'll be in-phase with
one another and reinforce.

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.220
Okay?
 

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:19.598
So there's the path difference
in red.

00:33:19.598 --> 00:33:22.847
If that happens to be --
suppose the wavelength of the

00:33:22.847 --> 00:33:24.980
light,
and the angle of the scattering

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.430
-- which also determines that
path difference,

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.970
as you can see -- suppose that
the wavelength and the angle are

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.338
such that that happens to be one
wavelength?

00:33:35.338 --> 00:33:38.160
Okay, so those are in-phase
with one another;

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.579
all seven will be scattering
together.

00:33:40.579 --> 00:33:42.450
Right?
 

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.111
How about the next one,
with two electrons,

00:33:46.111 --> 00:33:48.029
how about its phase?
 

00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:52.448
What was the condition we
talked about,

00:33:52.448 --> 00:33:54.890
up here at the top?
 

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:55.569
Student:  Evenly.
 

00:33:55.569 --> 00:33:56.368
Prof: Evenly spaced.
 

00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:59.970
So what do you know about the
next one?

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:00.430
Student: 
&gt;

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:03.704
Prof: It's going to be
in-phase too,

00:34:03.704 --> 00:34:06.279
two waves behind the first one.
 

00:34:06.279 --> 00:34:07.608
Right?
 

00:34:07.608 --> 00:34:10.226
It'll be two wavelengths behind
the first one,

00:34:10.226 --> 00:34:11.679
exactly, at some angle.
 

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:12.630
Right?
 

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:16.789
And the next one will be three
wavelengths behind.

00:34:16.789 --> 00:34:20.059
So all these electrons are
going to be scattering in-phase

00:34:20.059 --> 00:34:21.610
at that particular angle.
 

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.219
So you get a really strong
reflection coming out.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:24.949
Right?
 

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:30.829
It'll be as if it were all the
electrons working together.

00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:34.465
So the net in-phase scattering
is as if there were ten

00:34:34.465 --> 00:34:36.730
electrons doing the scattering.
 

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.550
That's great, right?
 

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:42.161
Now suppose that the first path
difference, instead -- suppose

00:34:42.161 --> 00:34:45.360
you had a different wavelength
or a different angle.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.483
So the first,
between the three and the four,

00:34:48.483 --> 00:34:52.389
suppose the difference in path
was half a wavelength.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:53.760
Then how would it differ?
 

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.170
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:57.969
Prof: How about between
the first and the second.

00:34:57.969 --> 00:34:58.320
Wilson?
 

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.170
Student:  Cancel.
 

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:00.000
Student:  The first and
the second?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.443
Prof: The first and the
second, would they exactly

00:35:01.443 --> 00:35:02.010
cancel and get zero?
 

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:03.440
Student:  There'd be one
left.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.389
Prof: Why?
 

00:35:04.389 --> 00:35:05.751
Student: There's one --
Prof: Ah,

00:35:05.751 --> 00:35:08.469
there are three in the first
and four in the second,

00:35:08.469 --> 00:35:08.949
right?
 

00:35:08.949 --> 00:35:15.530
So you got plus three but minus
four.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.010
How about the next one?
 

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.420
Speak up gang.
 

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.010
Students:  Plus two.
 

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:21.929
Prof: Plus two.
 

00:35:21.929 --> 00:35:22.929
And the last one?
 

00:35:22.929 --> 00:35:23.639
Students:  Minus one.
 

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:24.519
Prof: Minus one.
 

00:35:24.519 --> 00:35:26.250
And what's the net scattering?
 

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:26.940
Student:  Nothing.
 

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:29.010
Students:  Zero.
 

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:30.510
Prof: Zero.
 

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:32.210
Okay?
 

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.710
So you can see how this is a
neat trick to work.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:38.909
If you can see in the pattern a
bunch of planes which would

00:35:38.909 --> 00:35:42.065
contain the electrons,
then you can figure out in a

00:35:42.065 --> 00:35:46.163
particular direction,
how strong the scattering would

00:35:46.163 --> 00:35:46.550
be.
 

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:50.362
Now, we're going to do an
experiment and it requires the

00:35:50.362 --> 00:35:51.610
room to be dark.
 

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:55.523
And so I'm going to start
turning the lights off and ask

00:35:55.523 --> 00:35:59.650
Filip to get into position to do
stuff in the dark here.

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:05.340
Okay, and turn this one off.
 

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.150
Okay.
 

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.760
Now I'll show you first what
we're going to do.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:13.219
So pull out the little thing
there.

00:36:13.219 --> 00:36:16.449
And there's a laser that's
focused right here,

00:36:16.449 --> 00:36:18.943
but it's too bright,
because the other things we're

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:21.693
going to see are very dim,
which is why we had to turn the

00:36:21.693 --> 00:36:22.199
lights off.
 

00:36:22.199 --> 00:36:25.413
So I'm going to put this black
tube there, with a little hole

00:36:25.413 --> 00:36:26.110
in the end.
 

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:30.070
Hopefully I can get it
positioned so that most of the

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:34.489
laser will go inside here and we
won't see it very well.

00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:36.579
Let me get it positioned right.
 

00:36:36.579 --> 00:36:44.510
It's a moving target so it's
not so easy.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:53.070
Okay now, so here's the view
from the ceiling.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:56.487
There's the screen,
and this laser is coming from

00:36:56.487 --> 00:37:00.619
the back of the room and hitting
the screen, right here.

00:37:00.619 --> 00:37:02.780
Okay?
 

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:06.840
Now what Filip is going to do
is put things called diffraction

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.751
masks,
which are just slides,

00:37:08.751 --> 00:37:12.728
thirty-five millimeter slides,
and he's going to put them in

00:37:12.728 --> 00:37:14.369
the path of the light.
 

00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:18.554
And that's, the distance from
Filip to here,

00:37:18.554 --> 00:37:22.800
is 10.6 meters;
I measured it.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.639
Okay?
 

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:30.760
And so put in the first slide
please.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.320
And see this?
 

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.940
Those are all deflections at
different angles.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.860
And what's doing the scattering
is a slide that looks like this.

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.320
Okay?
 

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:47.090
A jail window, right?
 

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:50.179
Okay, so what it's giving is a
row of dots.

00:37:50.179 --> 00:37:52.780
Now I'm going to ask Filip to
do two things here.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:58.650
First, rotate the slide around
this axis, so rotate it like

00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.360
this.
 

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.940
What do you think will happen?
 

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.559
You see, right?
 

00:38:02.559 --> 00:38:07.275
The row of spots is
perpendicular to the direction

00:38:07.275 --> 00:38:08.719
of the lines.
 

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:09.909
Okay?
 

00:38:09.909 --> 00:38:11.739
And now I'm going to ask him to
do something else.

00:38:11.739 --> 00:38:15.010
I'm going to ask him to twist
the slide like this,

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.550
which changes the effective
distance between these.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.989
And notice what happens as he
makes them closer?

00:38:21.989 --> 00:38:25.409
Twisting makes them look closer
together, right?

00:38:25.409 --> 00:38:26.840
What happens to the spots?
 

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.820
Student:  Farther apart.
 

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:28.980
Prof: Does that surprise
you?

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:30.420
Student:  That's that
reciprocal --

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.920
Prof: That's that
reciprocal relationship.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.699
When things get closer together
the angles get bigger.

00:38:36.699 --> 00:38:40.349
Okay, now things are going to
get darker here.

00:38:40.349 --> 00:38:47.110
So I'm going to do some things.
 

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.449
Turn that out and also get the
room light.

00:38:51.449 --> 00:38:54.739
Well no, I want to show you
something here first.

00:38:54.739 --> 00:38:57.996
Okay, so I'm going to show you
what the masks are going to be

00:38:57.996 --> 00:39:00.820
and then we'll show you the
effect from the masks.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.222
Okay, so the next -- so here's
a question for you to work for

00:39:05.222 --> 00:39:06.030
homework.
 

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:11.849
What is the spacing of the
lines on Filip's slide?

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:16.860
How far are the bars in the
jail window apart on that slide,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.630
in order to give a spacing here
-- oh I did the wrong,

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:26.300
I was premature with that -- in
order to get that 10.8

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:31.478
centimeter spacing here,
at a distance of 10.6 meters,

00:39:31.478 --> 00:39:34.320
with 63 nanometer wavelength
light?

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:34.969
Okay?
 

00:39:34.969 --> 00:39:38.639
You can use that to find the
distance between the bars on his

00:39:38.639 --> 00:39:40.454
slide,
and I want you to do that,

00:39:40.454 --> 00:39:43.420
because if you can do it then
you understand how this works.

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.097
Okay, but the next one he's
going to show -- not yet but

00:39:47.097 --> 00:39:50.440
he'll put it in -- is one that's
a similar spacing,

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.179
but of pairs of lines.
 

00:39:52.179 --> 00:39:55.530
There's a pattern being
repeated, pairs of lines.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.260
Okay?
 

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:01.179
And then he's going to go to a
whole bunch of hexagons of dots,

00:40:01.179 --> 00:40:04.219
which we will call benzene,
but it's not exactly like

00:40:04.219 --> 00:40:06.398
benzene would be,
a benzene gas,

00:40:06.398 --> 00:40:10.070
because they're all oriented
exactly the same way.

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:10.750
Right?
 

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:13.139
So it's oriented benzene;
that's the next one we're going

00:40:13.139 --> 00:40:13.590
to look at.
 

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:16.592
And then we're going to look at
this one, which is also oriented

00:40:16.592 --> 00:40:17.070
benzene.
 

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:21.293
Can you see the difference in
the pattern between the one on

00:40:21.293 --> 00:40:23.869
the top and the one on the
bottom?

00:40:23.869 --> 00:40:26.360
Those red lines are a hint.
 

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.768
Student:  They're
connected.

00:40:28.768 --> 00:40:32.920
Prof: In the bottom
they're all pairs of hexagons,

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.431
that are distributed randomly,
where in the top they're

00:40:35.431 --> 00:40:36.268
individual ones.
 

00:40:36.268 --> 00:40:40.289
Now then he's going to show you
this one.

00:40:40.289 --> 00:40:41.510
How's that different?
 

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.960
Student:  Quadrupled.
 

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.199
Prof: It's quartets of
hexagons.

00:40:45.199 --> 00:40:48.454
And finally he's going to show
you this one,

00:40:48.454 --> 00:40:52.844
which is a crystal of hexagons,
and in a crystal they truly

00:40:52.844 --> 00:40:54.510
would be oriented.
 

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.909
Okay?
 

00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:58.867
And then we're going to -- the
pièce de

00:40:58.867 --> 00:41:01.893
résistance,
at the end of this sound and

00:41:01.893 --> 00:41:04.260
light show, is going to be that.
 

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.309
You know what that is?
 

00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:09.728
It's a light bulb filament,
that he's going to hold up in

00:41:09.728 --> 00:41:13.010
the path of this;
so a helix.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:17.469
Okay, now we're ready to do the
trick.

00:41:17.469 --> 00:41:22.478
So we'll mute that and do this,
and if you have a laptop open

00:41:22.478 --> 00:41:26.320
you'll need to close it because
we got to --

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:29.135
it's not very bright,
so we have to make it as dark

00:41:29.135 --> 00:41:34.237
as possible,
and I have to find my way back

00:41:34.237 --> 00:41:38.070
there and close my laptop.
 

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.110
Okay you ready Filip?
 

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:39.719
Teaching Fellow:  Yes.
 

00:41:39.719 --> 00:41:42.476
Prof: Okay,
so first it's going to be pairs

00:41:42.476 --> 00:41:43.320
of jail bars.
 

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.730
So how does it look different
from what we saw before?

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:47.469
Student:  Like triplets.
 

00:41:47.469 --> 00:41:48.630
Student:  Like different
lights in there.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:53.141
Prof: It's the same kind
of dots but their intensity is

00:41:53.141 --> 00:41:54.030
modulated.
 

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:57.875
They're not just evenly --
they're not just all the same or

00:41:57.875 --> 00:42:01.389
slowly dying away as you move
out to right or left.

00:42:01.389 --> 00:42:03.530
They come in a pattern.
 

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:06.420
Okay, now let's do the next one.
 

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:10.237
This is the one that's benzene,
but randomly,

00:42:10.237 --> 00:42:13.099
a random collection of benzene.
 

00:42:13.099 --> 00:42:14.539
So how would you describe that?
 

00:42:14.539 --> 00:42:15.860
Student:  A snowflake.
 

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.920
Prof: It looks like a
snowflake.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:21.860
Oh, my laptop has come on.
 

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.280
&gt;
 

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.909
Go figure.
 

00:42:24.909 --> 00:42:31.500
I'm putting things to cover the
lights up here.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.829
Okay, so it's a snowflake.
 

00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:41.840
Now we're going to look at
pairs of benzenes.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:43.280
How is it different?
 

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.719
It's still the snowflake.
 

00:42:44.719 --> 00:42:46.280
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:48.510
Prof: But there are bars
across it.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.500
Everybody see that?
 

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.820
Student:  Yes.
 

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.081
Prof: Can we stop the
green blink back there or put

00:42:55.081 --> 00:42:56.340
something across it?
 

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.340
That's good.
 

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:01.150
Okay, now we're going to do
quartets of benzenes.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.833
How does that look?
 

00:43:03.833 --> 00:43:07.929
How would you describe that?
 

00:43:07.929 --> 00:43:09.739
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:43:09.739 --> 00:43:13.496
Prof: It's now got bars
going in both directions,

00:43:13.496 --> 00:43:16.639
not just horizontaloid but also
verticaloid;

00:43:16.639 --> 00:43:19.429
they're actually vertical I
think, but not quite.

00:43:19.429 --> 00:43:28.179
Okay, now a lattice of benzenes.
 

00:43:28.179 --> 00:43:30.010
Isn't that great?
 

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:34.190
So it takes the same -- it's
the same underlying pattern,

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:37.679
the snowflake,
but it concentrates all the

00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:41.000
light that would've been spread
out,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.909
into very, very fine points.
 

00:43:43.909 --> 00:43:47.420
Remember when it was just
pairs, we put bars across,

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.900
but it was the same amount of
light coming out,

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.978
so that it got focused sort of,
and when we have a whole

00:43:52.978 --> 00:43:55.050
lattice it gets fabulously
focused.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:58.231
I can see things quite far out
from the middle here,

00:43:58.231 --> 00:44:00.539
because I'm so close to the
screen.

00:44:00.539 --> 00:44:03.139
I'll hold my hand up but you
can't see my hand.

00:44:03.139 --> 00:44:04.300
&gt;
 

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.530
They go way out.
 

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.130
So that's what a crystal is.
 

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:12.396
The crystal takes the same
underlying pattern,

00:44:12.396 --> 00:44:17.706
that comes from the molecule,
and focuses it into intense

00:44:17.706 --> 00:44:20.739
points at many,
many angles.

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:25.505
So it's like looking at the
scattering from a single

00:44:25.505 --> 00:44:29.989
molecule but looking at it
through a pegboard.

00:44:29.989 --> 00:44:32.579
You know what a pegboard is?
 

00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:36.230
In a tool shop you used to put
a pegboard up.

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:40.650
It's a piece of masonite or
something that had holes in it,

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.840
regularly, and you could put
little hooks in it to hang your

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.679
hammer and your saw and whatnot.
 

00:44:45.679 --> 00:44:48.793
So it's as if you have,
you're looking through such a

00:44:48.793 --> 00:44:51.070
pegboard at that underlying
pattern.

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:53.347
And now we're ready for the
pièce de

00:44:53.347 --> 00:44:55.570
résistance,
which is the light bulb

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:57.469
filament, which is hard to see.
 

00:44:57.469 --> 00:45:00.179
This is why we really needed
the lights out.

00:45:00.179 --> 00:45:03.947
We needed it for the snowflake
too because it was so -- so what

00:45:03.947 --> 00:45:06.440
do you see for the light bulb
filament?

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.130
Students: An X.
 

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:12.139
Prof: You see an X,
right?

00:45:12.139 --> 00:45:15.309
Can people in the back see the
X?

00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:17.889
And there are dots along the
arms of the X.

00:45:17.889 --> 00:45:21.018
Okay?
 

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:24.315
So that does it,
you can open your laptops again

00:45:24.315 --> 00:45:27.610
now and we'll try to get some
lights back on.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:30.889
Sorry for straining your eyes.
 

00:45:30.889 --> 00:45:43.860
&lt;&lt;Technical
adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.204
Prof: Okay,
so there's the scattering from

00:45:48.204 --> 00:45:53.909
these things and we can -- now
so let's try to understand it.

00:45:53.909 --> 00:45:58.280
So this was the slide with
randomly positioned but oriented

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.110
benzenes.
 

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.465
It turns out that random
positioning generates the same

00:46:02.465 --> 00:46:06.320
diffraction as a single pattern
but gives it more intensity.

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.264
If we'd just put one hexagon
there you wouldn't have seen

00:46:09.264 --> 00:46:10.159
enough from it.
 

00:46:10.159 --> 00:46:14.925
Okay, so here's the pattern you
got from isolated benzenes,

00:46:14.925 --> 00:46:17.719
which is that snowflake
pattern.

00:46:17.719 --> 00:46:19.880
Right?
 

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.829
And when we had a lattice made
of those,

00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:25.860
you saw the same underlying
pattern,

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:30.250
but only at little -- only at
regularly spaced spots that had

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:34.860
to do with how far apart the
hexagons were from one another,

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.619
and much more intense,
because all the light that

00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:43.476
would be scattered all over the
screen here is focused in those

00:46:43.476 --> 00:46:44.730
little dots.
 

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:48.452
Okay, now the thing that
generated this snowflake was

00:46:48.452 --> 00:46:52.320
benzene, or what we're calling
benzene, the hexagon.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.869
Okay, now can you see what we
need in order to understand?

00:46:56.869 --> 00:47:00.396
What do you look for in order
to see what directions will give

00:47:00.396 --> 00:47:01.380
you scattering?
 

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:06.719
Ah sorry, I was having so much
fun we went over.

00:47:06.719 --> 00:47:08.349
So we'll talk about this next
week.

00:47:08.349 --> 00:47:09.289
Thanks.
 

00:47:09.289 --> 00:47:09.699
And thanks Elaine.

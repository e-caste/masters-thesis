00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.312
Professor Christine
Hayes: Today what I'd like

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:07.207
to do is begin our survey of
Genesis 1 through 11,

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:10.515
in order to illustrate the way
that biblical writers--and

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.297
precisely who we think they were
and when they lived is something

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:17.901
we'll talk about later--but the
way biblical writers drew upon

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.268
the cultural and religious
legacy of the Ancient Near East

00:00:21.268 --> 00:00:24.695
that we've been talking about,
its stories and its imagery,

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:28.358
even as they transformed it in
order to conform to a new vision

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:30.840
of a non-mythological god.
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.029
We're going to be looking at
some of Kaufman's ideas as we

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:35.540
read some of these texts.
 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.378
Now one of the scholars who's
written quite extensively and

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:47.518
eloquently on the adaptation of
Ancient Near Eastern motifs in

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:53.457
biblical literature is a scholar
by the name of Nahum Sarna:

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:56.880
I highly recommend his book.
 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.874
It appears on your optional
reading list,

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:01.617
and I'll be drawing very
heavily on Sarna's work as well

00:01:01.617 --> 00:01:04.409
as the work of some other
scholars who have spent a great

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.202
deal of time comparing Israelite
and Ancient Near Eastern

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:09.464
stories,
particularly these opening

00:01:09.464 --> 00:01:12.842
chapters, in order to see the
features that they share and to

00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:16.164
wonder if perhaps there isn't
after all a chasm that divides

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:17.459
them quite deeply.
 

00:01:17.459 --> 00:01:21.847
In our consideration of Genesis
1 and 2, we first need to

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:25.452
consider a Babylonian epic,
an epic that is known by its

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.879
opening words at the top of the
column over there,

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:31.417
Enuma Elish,
which means "when on high," the

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:33.470
opening words of this epic.
 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.510
And the epic opens before the
formation of heaven and earth.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.790
Nothing existed except water,
and water existed in two forms.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.162
There's the primeval fresh
water, fresh water ocean,

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:49.337
which is identified with a male
divine principle,

00:01:49.337 --> 00:01:52.813
a male god Apsu.
You have a primeval salt water

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:56.832
ocean which is identified with a
female divine principle,

00:01:56.832 --> 00:02:00.287
Tiamat.
Tiamat appears as this watery

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:05.290
ocean but also as a very fierce
dragon-like monster.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.015
I will be reading sections from
Speiser's translation of

00:02:10.015 --> 00:02:13.796
Enuma Elish,
part of the anthology put

00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:16.030
together by Pritchard.
 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.966
It begins:
When on high the heaven

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:22.558
had not been named,
Firm ground below had not been

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:25.806
called by name,
Naught but primordial Apsu,

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:27.487
their begetter,
[And]

00:02:27.487 --> 00:02:30.430
Mummu-Tiamat,
she who bore them all,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.580
Their waters co-mingling as a
single body;

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.889
No reed hut had been matted,
no marsh land had appeared,

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:39.660
When no gods whatever had been
brought into being,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.759
Uncalled by name,
their destinies undetermined--;

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:46.770
Then it was that the gods were
formed within them.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.120
So there's some sort of
co-mingling or union of these

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.440
male and female divine
principals,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.582
a sexual union of Apsu and
Tiamat that begins a process of

00:02:56.582 --> 00:03:00.580
generation and it produces first
demons and monsters.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.150
Eventually gods will begin to
emerge.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.299
Now, in time,
Tiamat and Apsu are disturbed

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.240
by the din and the tumult of
these younger gods.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.569
The divine brothers
banded together,

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.210
They disturbed Tiamat as they
surged back and forth,

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.960
Yea, they troubled the mood of
Tiamat

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.830
By their hilarity in the Abode
of Heaven.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.040
…
Apsu, opening his mouth,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.706
Said unto resplendent Tiamat:
"Their ways are verily

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:27.680
loathsome unto me.
 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.860
By day I find no relief,
nor repose by night.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.220
I will destroy,
I will wreck their ways,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.760
That quiet may be restored.
 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.770
Let us have rest."
 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.876
…
Then answered Mummu,

00:03:37.876 --> 00:03:40.169
[Mummu Tiamat]
giving counsel to Apsu;

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.274
[Ill-wishing]
and ungracious was Mummu's

00:03:42.274 --> 00:03:43.520
advice:
"Do destroy,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.419
my father, the mutinous ways.
 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.840
Then shalt thou have relief by
day and rest by night."

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.740
When Apsu heard this,
his face grew radiant

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.103
Because of the evil he planned
against the gods,

00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:58.363
his sons.
So he decides to destroy the

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.939
gods and he is thwarted by a
water god named Ea,

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:06.000
an earth-water god--sorry,
he's a combination earth-water

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.340
god--named Ea.
And Apsu is killed.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.120
Tiamat now is enraged and she's
bent on revenge.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.269
She makes plans to attack all
of the gods with her assembled

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.000
forces.
The gods are terrified and they

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.066
need a leader to lead them
against her army and they turn

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:25.968
to Marduk.
Marduk agrees to lead them in

00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:29.209
battle against Tiamat and her
assembled forces,

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:32.920
her forces are under the
generalship of Kingu,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.289
and he agrees to lead them
against Tiamat and Kingu on

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.000
condition that he be granted
sovereignty,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.870
and he sets terms.
 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.990
His heart exulting,
he said to his father:

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.250
"Creator of the gods,
destiny of the great gods,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.152
If I indeed, as your avenger,
Am to vanquish Tiamat and save

00:04:54.152 --> 00:04:56.384
your lives,
Set up the Assembly,

00:04:56.384 --> 00:04:58.319
proclaim supreme my destiny!
 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.871
…Let my word,
instead of you,

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:01.009
determine the fates.
 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.189
Unalterable shall be what I may
bring into being,

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.406
Neither recalled nor changed
shall be the command of my

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:10.199
lips."
And the agreement is struck.

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.839
And Marduk fells Tiamat in
battle.

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:19.226
It's a fierce battle and there
is in fact a memorable passage

00:05:19.226 --> 00:05:21.560
that details her demise.
 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.620
In fury,
Tiamat cried out aloud,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.139
To the roots her legs shook
both together.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.079
…Then joined issue,
Tiamat and Marduk…,

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:32.670
They strove in single combat,
locked in battle.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.149
The lord [Marduk]
spread out his net to enfold

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:36.368
her,
The Evil Wind,

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:39.480
which followed behind,
he let loose in her face.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.100
When Tiamat opened her mouth to
consume him.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.490
He drove in the Evil Wind that
she close not her lips.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.050
As the fierce winds charged her
belly,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.129
Her body was distended and her
mouth was wide open.

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.220
He released the arrow,
it tore her belly,

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.750
It cut through her insides,
splitting the heart.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.839
Having thus subdued her,
he extinguished her life.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:02.259
He cast down her carcass to
stand upon it.

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.360
Well, what do you do with the
carcass of a ferocious monster?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.819
You build a world,
and that's what Marduk did.

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:12.073
He takes the carcass,
he slices it into two halves,

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:15.327
rather like a clamshell,
and out of the top half he

00:06:15.327 --> 00:06:17.800
creates the firmament,
the Heaven.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.519
With the other half he creates
the land, the Earth.

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:23.079
He split her like a
shellfish into two parts.

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:25.379
Half of her he set up and
ceiled it as sky,

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.149
Pulled down the bar and posted
guards.

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:32.560
He bade them to allow not her
waters to escape.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.920
Alright, so he has used her
body to press back her waters

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.378
and that's what the ceiling is,
the firmament,

00:06:39.378 --> 00:06:45.079
a firm sheet or structure
that's holding back waters.

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:47.410
When little holes come along,
that's rain coming through.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.086
And the bottom part is the
land, which is pressing down

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:52.439
waters below.
They come up every now and then

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.190
in springs and rivers and seas
and lakes and things.

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.597
That is the created world,
but he doesn't stop there and

00:06:57.597 --> 00:06:59.829
he creates various heavenly
bodies at this point.

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:02.372
"He constructed stations for
the great gods"--the heavenly

00:07:02.372 --> 00:07:04.959
bodies were understood as
stations for the great gods--

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:07.740
Fixing their astral
likenesses as constellations.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.529
He determined the year by
designating the zones;

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:13.120
He set up three constellations
for each of the twelve months.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.703
…
The moon he caused to shine,

00:07:15.703 --> 00:07:17.920
the night to him
entrusting.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.439
And then the complaints begin
to roll in.

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.806
The gods are very unhappy
because they have now been

00:07:22.806 --> 00:07:25.589
assigned specific duties in the
maintenance of the cosmos.

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:27.890
The moon god has to come up at
night and hang around for a

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.899
while and go back down.
 

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:30.960
And the sun has to trundle
across the sky,

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.825
and they're pretty unhappy
about this and they want relief

00:07:33.825 --> 00:07:36.690
from working and laboring at
their assigned stations,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.959
and so Marduk accedes to this
demand.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.607
He takes blood from the slain
General Kingu,

00:07:43.607 --> 00:07:47.170
the leader of Tiamat's army,
the rebels,

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.156
and he fashions a human being
with the express purpose of

00:07:51.156 --> 00:07:53.790
freeing the gods from menial
labor.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.000
Blood I will mass and
cause bones to be.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.480
I will establish a savage,
"man" shall be his name,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.930
Verily, savage man I will
create.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.600
He shall be charged with the
service of the gods

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.860
That they might be at ease.
 

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:10.095
…
"It was Kingu who contrived the

00:08:10.095 --> 00:08:11.993
uprising,
And made Tiamat rebel,

00:08:11.993 --> 00:08:13.259
and joined battle."
 

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.399
[So]
They bound him,

00:08:14.399 --> 00:08:15.839
holding him before Ea.
 

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.048
…[And]
Out of [Kingu's]

00:08:17.048 --> 00:08:18.880
blood they fashioned mankind
[And]

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.209
Ea imposed the service and let
free the gods.

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:27.107
So the grateful gods now
recognize the sovereignty of

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:32.569
Marduk and they build him a
magnificent shrine or temple in

00:08:32.569 --> 00:08:35.225
Babylon,
pronounced "Bab-el" which

00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:38.519
simply means gateway of the god,
the gate of the god.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:43.309
Babylon means the city that is
the gateway of the god.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:46.683
And a big banquet follows and
Marduk is praised for all that

00:08:46.683 --> 00:08:49.370
he's accomplished,
and his kingship is confirmed

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:51.200
and Enuma Elish ends.
 

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.679
It was the great national epic
of the city of Babel or Babylon.

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:58.748
It was recited during the New
Year festival,

00:08:58.748 --> 00:09:01.779
which was the most important
festival on the cultic calendar,

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:05.603
and Nahum Sarna points out that
it had four main functions which

00:09:05.603 --> 00:09:07.059
I've listed over here.
 

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:08.889
The first of those functions is
theogonic.

00:09:08.889 --> 00:09:11.523
It tells us the story of the
birth of the gods,

00:09:11.523 --> 00:09:12.840
where they came from.
 

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.799
Its second function is
cosmological.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:19.600
It's explaining cosmic
phenomena: the land,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:25.029
the sky, the heavenly bodies
and so on, and their origins.

00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:27.744
It also serves a social and
political function,

00:09:27.744 --> 00:09:31.463
because the portrait or picture
of the universe or the world and

00:09:31.463 --> 00:09:35.004
its structure corresponds to and
legitimates the structure of

00:09:35.004 --> 00:09:36.480
Babylonian society.
 

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.992
The position and the function
of the humans in the scheme of

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:43.267
creation corresponds or
parallels precisely the position

00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:45.529
of slaves in Mesopotamian
society.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:48.524
The position and function of
Marduk at the top of the

00:09:48.524 --> 00:09:52.094
hierarchy of authority parallels
and legitimates the Babylonian

00:09:52.094 --> 00:09:55.699
King ,
with others arranged within the

00:09:55.699 --> 00:09:58.240
pyramid that falls below.
 

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.570
The epic also explains and
mirrors the rise of Babel as one

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:06.080
of the great cities in the
Ancient Near East.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.656
It explains its rise to power,
and Marduk's rise from being a

00:10:09.656 --> 00:10:13.590
city god to being at the head of
the pantheon of a large empire.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.389
This also had a cultic function
as well.

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:20.823
According to Sarna and some
other scholars,

00:10:20.823 --> 00:10:23.025
the conflict,
that battle scene between

00:10:23.025 --> 00:10:26.269
Tiamat and Marduk which is
described at some length,

00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:30.107
symbolizes the conflict or the
battle between the forces of

00:10:30.107 --> 00:10:33.350
chaos and the forces of cosmos
or cosmic order.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.100
And that's a perpetual conflict.
 

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.187
Each year it's dramatized by
the cycle of the seasons,

00:10:38.187 --> 00:10:41.683
and at a certain time of the
year it seems that the forces of

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.830
darkness and chaos are
prevailing but each spring,

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.389
once again, cosmic order and
life return.

00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:51.730
So the epic served as a kind of
script for the re-enactment of

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.429
the primeval battle in a cultic
or temple setting,

00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:59.859
and that re-enactment helped to
ensure the victory of the forces

00:10:59.859 --> 00:11:03.796
of cosmos and life each year
over the forces of chaos and

00:11:03.796 --> 00:11:05.687
death.
So if we recall now,

00:11:05.687 --> 00:11:09.073
some of the things we were
talking about last time and the

00:11:09.073 --> 00:11:12.195
theories of Kaufman,
we might describe the worldview

00:11:12.195 --> 00:11:15.649
that's expressed by Enuma
Elish in the following way,

00:11:15.649 --> 00:11:17.899
and this is certainly what
Sarna does.

00:11:17.899 --> 00:11:20.987
We're going to consider first
of all the view of the gods,

00:11:20.987 --> 00:11:23.424
the view of humans,
and the view of the world:

00:11:23.424 --> 00:11:25.050
three distinct categories.
 

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:26.770
First of all the gods.
 

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.070
The gods are clearly limited.
 

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.070
A god can make a plan and
they're thwarted by another god

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:33.570
who then murders that god.
 

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.178
They are amoral,
some of them are nicer and

00:11:36.178 --> 00:11:39.903
better than others but they're
not necessarily morally

00:11:39.903 --> 00:11:41.269
good or righteous.
 

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:44.594
They emerge from this
indifferent primal realm,

00:11:44.594 --> 00:11:47.340
this mixture of salt and sea
waters,

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:50.338
that is the source of all being
and the source of ultimate

00:11:50.338 --> 00:11:53.389
power, but they age and they
mature and they fight and they

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:55.771
die.
They're not wholly good,

00:11:55.771 --> 00:11:59.039
not wholly evil,
and no one god's will is

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:02.284
absolute.
The portrait of humans that

00:12:02.284 --> 00:12:06.309
emerges is that humans are
unimportant menials.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:09.140
They are the slaves of the
gods, the gods have little

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.590
reciprocal interest in or
concern for them,

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.238
and they create human beings to
do the work of running the

00:12:15.238 --> 00:12:16.775
world.
To some degree,

00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:19.509
they look upon them as slaves
or pawns.

00:12:19.509 --> 00:12:23.010
The picture of the world that
would seem to emerge from this

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.740
story is that it is a morally
neutral place.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.491
That means that for humans it
can be a difficult and hostile

00:12:29.491 --> 00:12:31.494
place.
The best bet perhaps is to

00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:34.138
serve the god of the
day--whatever god might be

00:12:34.138 --> 00:12:37.529
ascendant--to earn his favor and
perhaps his protection,

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:41.388
but even that god will have
limited powers and abilities and

00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:44.919
may in fact be defeated or may
turn on his devotees.

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:47.263
Now if we turn to the creation
story, the first of the two

00:12:47.263 --> 00:12:48.950
creation stories that are in the
Bible,

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.452
because in fact there are two
creation stories with quite a

00:12:51.452 --> 00:12:55.129
few contradictions between them,
but if we turn to the first

00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:59.466
creation story in Genesis 1
which concludes in Genesis

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:01.656
2:4…and,
not for nothing,

00:13:01.656 --> 00:13:05.176
but everyone understands the
function of the colon,

00:13:05.176 --> 00:13:07.515
right?
So if you say Genesis 1:1,

00:13:07.515 --> 00:13:09.549
I mean chapter one,
verse one.

00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:13.309
And then it goes to Genesis 2
chapter two, verse 4;

00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:16.093
left side of the colon is
chapter, right side of the colon

00:13:16.093 --> 00:13:19.170
is verse, and every sentence has
a verse number in the Bible;

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.169
approximately sentence.
 

00:13:21.169 --> 00:13:24.145
If we look now,
we'll see a different picture

00:13:24.145 --> 00:13:26.839
emerging.
The biblical god in this story,

00:13:26.839 --> 00:13:30.360
which I hope you have read,
is presented as being supreme

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.108
and unlimited.
That's connected with the lack

00:13:33.108 --> 00:13:36.072
of mythology in Genesis 1 or
rather the suppression of

00:13:36.072 --> 00:13:37.789
mythology.
Okay, there's a distinction

00:13:37.789 --> 00:13:39.584
between the two and we'll have
to talk about that,

00:13:39.584 --> 00:13:42.039
and I hope that you'll get into
some of that in section as well.

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:44.970
I'm using the term mythology
now the way we used it in the

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.899
last lecture when we were
talking about Kaufman's work.

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:51.491
Mythology is used to describe
stories that deal with the

00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:54.559
birth, the life events of gods
and demi-gods,

00:13:54.559 --> 00:13:57.911
sometimes legendary heroes,
but narrating a sequence of

00:13:57.911 --> 00:14:00.304
events.
The biblical creation account

00:14:00.304 --> 00:14:03.973
is non-mythological because
there is no biography of God in

00:14:03.973 --> 00:14:05.669
here.
God simply is.

00:14:05.669 --> 00:14:08.289
There's no theogony,
no account of his birth.

00:14:08.289 --> 00:14:12.984
There's no story by means of
which he emerges from some other

00:14:12.984 --> 00:14:14.967
realm.
In the Mesopotamian account,

00:14:14.967 --> 00:14:17.828
the gods themselves are created
and they're not even created

00:14:17.828 --> 00:14:20.340
first, actually;
the first generation of beings

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.256
creates these odd demons and
monsters, and gods only are

00:14:23.256 --> 00:14:25.747
created after several
generations and the god of

00:14:25.747 --> 00:14:28.678
creation,
Marduk, is actually kind of a

00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:30.639
latecomer in the picture.
 

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:34.777
And this is also a good time
for us to draw a distinction

00:14:34.777 --> 00:14:36.919
between mythology and myth.
 

00:14:36.919 --> 00:14:40.296
Kaufman and others have claimed
that mythology is not in,

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:43.793
certainly, this biblical story
or if it's not there it's at

00:14:43.793 --> 00:14:45.059
least suppressed.
 

00:14:45.059 --> 00:14:48.639
But in contrast,
myth is not mythology.

00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:52.500
Myth is a term we use to refer
to a traditional story.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.000
It's often fanciful,
it relates imaginatively events

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.059
which it claims happened in
historical time,

00:15:01.059 --> 00:15:04.596
not in a primordial realm
before time, and a myth is

00:15:04.596 --> 00:15:08.965
designed to explain some kind of
practice or ritual or custom or

00:15:08.965 --> 00:15:10.559
natural phenomenon.
 

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:13.114
"And that is why to this day,"
you know, "there…",

00:15:13.114 --> 00:15:15.218
I don't know,
give me some myth that we all

00:15:15.218 --> 00:15:17.563
know of,
you know, Paul Bunyan's axe

00:15:17.563 --> 00:15:21.373
handle is something in
American nature which I now no

00:15:21.373 --> 00:15:23.944
longer remember!
But myths are fanciful,

00:15:23.944 --> 00:15:27.277
imaginative tales that are
trying to explain the existence

00:15:27.277 --> 00:15:30.727
of either a thing or a practice
or even a belief…sometimes

00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:34.059
it's a story that's a veiled
explanation of a truth,

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:36.740
we think of parables,
perhaps, or allegories.

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:39.635
And so the claim that's often
made is that the Bible doesn't

00:15:39.635 --> 00:15:41.009
have full-blown mythology.
 

00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:44.332
It doesn't focus on stories
about the lives and deaths and

00:15:44.332 --> 00:15:47.247
interactions of gods,
but it does certainly contain

00:15:47.247 --> 00:15:49.884
myths.
It has traditional stories and

00:15:49.884 --> 00:15:53.993
legends, some quite fanciful,
whose goal it is to explain how

00:15:53.993 --> 00:15:56.389
and why something is what it is.
 

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:59.737
So returning to Genesis 1,
we have an absence of theogony

00:15:59.737 --> 00:16:03.503
and mythology in the sense of a
biography of God in this opening

00:16:03.503 --> 00:16:07.149
chapter and that means the
absence of a metadivine realm.

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:09.883
If you remember nothing else
from this course and certainly

00:16:09.883 --> 00:16:12.286
for the mid-term exam,
you should remember the words

00:16:12.286 --> 00:16:13.370
"metadivine realm."
 

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.890
There's a little hint for you
there.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.549
It's an important concept.
 

00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:19.202
You don't have to buy into it,
you just have to know it,

00:16:19.202 --> 00:16:21.347
okay.
But there is an absence of what

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.678
Kaufman would call this
metadivine realm,

00:16:23.678 --> 00:16:26.710
this primordial realm from
which the gods emerge.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:30.058
We also, therefore,
have no sense that God is

00:16:30.058 --> 00:16:34.929
imminent in nature or tied to
natural substances or phenomena.

00:16:34.929 --> 00:16:38.962
So, the biblical god's powers
and knowledge do not appear to

00:16:38.962 --> 00:16:42.721
be limited by the prior
existence of any other substance

00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:45.830
or power.
Nature also is not divine.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.057
It's demythologized,
de-divinized,

00:16:48.057 --> 00:16:50.877
if that's a word;
the created world is not

00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:54.335
divine, it is not the physical
manifestation of various

00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:57.409
deities, an earth god,
a water god and so on.

00:16:57.409 --> 00:17:00.888
The line of demarcation
therefore between the divine and

00:17:00.888 --> 00:17:04.430
the natural and human worlds
would appear to be clear.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.755
So, to summarize,
in Genesis 1,

00:17:06.755 --> 00:17:10.710
the view of god is that there
is one supreme god,

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.544
who is creator and sovereign of
the world, who simply exists,

00:17:14.544 --> 00:17:19.294
who appears to be incorporeal,
and for whom the realm of

00:17:19.294 --> 00:17:23.190
nature is separate and
subservient.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.569
He has no life story,
no mythology,

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.460
and his will is absolute.
 

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.688
Indeed, creation takes place
through the simple expression of

00:17:30.688 --> 00:17:32.651
his will.
"When God began to create

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:35.558
heaven and earth," and there's a
parenthetical clause:

00:17:35.558 --> 00:17:38.630
"God said, 'Let there be light'
and there was light."

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.732
He expressed his will that
there be light,

00:17:40.732 --> 00:17:43.912
and there was light and that's
very different from many Ancient

00:17:43.912 --> 00:17:46.783
Near Eastern cosmogonies in
which there's always a sexual

00:17:46.783 --> 00:17:48.630
principal at work in creation.
 

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.701
Creation is always the result
of procreation in some way,

00:17:51.701 --> 00:17:53.839
male and female principles
combining.

00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:57.295
There's a very similar Egyptian
creation story actually in which

00:17:57.295 --> 00:17:59.490
the god Ptah just wills "let
this be."

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.231
It reads very much like Genesis
1 and yet even so there's still

00:18:03.231 --> 00:18:06.550
a sexual act that follows the
expression of those wills,

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.299
so it is still different.
 

00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:11.121
Consider now the portrait of
humans, humankind,

00:18:11.121 --> 00:18:14.739
that emerges from the biblical
creation story in contrast to

00:18:14.739 --> 00:18:16.150
Enuma Elish.
 

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.650
In Genesis, humans are
important;

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.720
in Genesis 1 humans are
important.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.678
And in fact the biblical view
of humans really emerges from

00:18:23.678 --> 00:18:27.261
both of the creation stories,
when they're read together--the

00:18:27.261 --> 00:18:31.393
story here in Genesis 1 and then
the creation story that occupies

00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:34.412
much of 2 and 3.
The two accounts are extremely

00:18:34.412 --> 00:18:38.055
different but they both signal
the unique position and dignity

00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:39.369
of the human being.
 

00:18:39.369 --> 00:18:43.821
In the first account in Genesis
1, the creation of the human is

00:18:43.821 --> 00:18:48.130
clearly the climactic divine
act: after this God can rest.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:51.049
And a sign of the humans'
importance is the fact that

00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:53.970
humans are said to be created in
the image of God,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.983
and this occurs in Genesis
1:26, "Let us make man in our

00:18:57.983 --> 00:19:00.100
image, after our likeness."
 

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.819
What might that mean?
 

00:19:01.819 --> 00:19:04.872
Looking at the continuation of
the verse, of the passage,

00:19:04.872 --> 00:19:06.779
we have some idea because
humans,

00:19:06.779 --> 00:19:11.164
we see, are going to be charged
with specific duties towards,

00:19:11.164 --> 00:19:13.839
and rights over,
the created world.

00:19:13.839 --> 00:19:16.125
And it seems,
therefore, that the idea of

00:19:16.125 --> 00:19:19.325
being created in the image of
God is connected with those

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:21.039
special rights and duties.
 

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:24.270
A creature is required who is
distinguished in certain ways

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:25.440
from other animals.
 

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.819
How are humans distinguished
from other animals?

00:19:27.819 --> 00:19:30.488
You could make a long list but
it might include things like the

00:19:30.488 --> 00:19:33.200
capacity for language and higher
thought or abstract thought,

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.259
conscience, self-control,
free-will.

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:40.062
So, if those are the
distinctive characteristics that

00:19:40.062 --> 00:19:44.231
earn the human being certain
rights over creation but also

00:19:44.231 --> 00:19:47.009
give them duties towards
creation,

00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:49.803
and the human is distinct from
animals in being created in the

00:19:49.803 --> 00:19:51.973
image of God,
there's perhaps a connection:

00:19:51.973 --> 00:19:54.428
to be godlike is to perhaps
possess some of these

00:19:54.428 --> 00:19:57.416
characteristics.
Now being created in the image

00:19:57.416 --> 00:19:59.970
of God carries a further
implication.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:03.876
It implies that human life is
somehow sacred and deserving of

00:20:03.876 --> 00:20:05.829
special care and protection.
 

00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:10.652
And that's why in Genesis 9:6
we read, "Whoever sheds the

00:20:10.652 --> 00:20:14.355
blood of man,
in exchange for that man shall

00:20:14.355 --> 00:20:18.329
his blood be shed,
for in the image of God was man

00:20:18.329 --> 00:20:21.069
created".
invoke that rationale from

00:20:21.069 --> 00:20:24.970
Genesis 1 in the absolute
prohibition on murder.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.980
There is no way to compensate
or punish someone for murder,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.420
it simply means forfeiture of
one's own life.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:31.880
That's how sacred human life is.
 

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.109
That's the biblical view.
 

00:20:33.109 --> 00:20:37.086
So, the concept of the divine
image in humans--that's a

00:20:37.086 --> 00:20:40.400
powerful idea,
that there is a divine image in

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.268
humans,
and that breaks with other

00:20:43.268 --> 00:20:45.960
ancient conceptions of the
human.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.694
In Genesis 1,
humans are not the menials of

00:20:48.694 --> 00:20:52.014
God, and in fact Genesis
expresses the antithesis of

00:20:52.014 --> 00:20:54.020
this.
Where in Enuma Elish,

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.961
service was imposed upon humans
so the gods were free--they

00:20:56.961 --> 00:20:58.940
didn't have to worry about
anything,

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.279
the humans would take care of
the gods--we have the reverse;

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:06.000
it's almost like a polemical
inversion in Genesis 1.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.511
The very first communication of
God to the human that's created

00:21:09.511 --> 00:21:12.910
is concern for that creature's
physical needs and welfare.

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.741
He says in Genesis 1:28-29,
he blesses them,

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:19.298
"God blessed them and God said
to them, 'Be fertile and

00:21:19.298 --> 00:21:22.130
increase, fill the earth and
master it;

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.358
and rule the fish of the sea,
the birds of the sky and all

00:21:24.358 --> 00:21:26.000
the living things that creep on
earth.'"

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.541
In Genesis 2:16 after the
creation story there,

00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:31.855
"And the Lord God commanded the
man saying, 'Of every tree of

00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:33.900
the garden you are free to
eat.'"

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.299
His first thought is what are
you going to eat?

00:21:35.299 --> 00:21:38.259
I want you to be fruitful and
multiply, and so on.

00:21:38.259 --> 00:21:41.589
So, humans in Genesis are not
presented as the helpless

00:21:41.589 --> 00:21:43.809
victims of blind forces of
nature.

00:21:43.809 --> 00:21:46.380
They're not the menials and
servants of capricious gods.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.468
They are creatures of majesty
and dignity and they are of

00:21:50.468 --> 00:21:53.170
importance to,
objects of concern for,

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.579
the god who has created them.
 

00:21:55.579 --> 00:21:58.968
At the same time,
and I think very much in line

00:21:58.968 --> 00:22:03.535
with the assertion that humans
are created in the image of God,

00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:06.039
humans are not,
in fact, gods.

00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:10.424
They are still creatures in the
sense of created things and they

00:22:10.424 --> 00:22:12.789
are dependent on a higher power.
 

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:16.772
So in the second creation story
beginning in Genesis 2:4,

00:22:16.772 --> 00:22:21.252
we read that the first human is
formed when God fashions it from

00:22:21.252 --> 00:22:23.670
the dust of the earth or clay.
 

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.830
There are lots of Ancient Near
Eastern stories of gods

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:30.156
fashioning humans from clay;
we have depictions of gods as

00:22:30.156 --> 00:22:33.230
potters at a potter's wheel just
turning out lots of little

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.780
humans.
But the biblical account as

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:39.821
much as it borrows from that
motif again takes pains to

00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:42.589
distinguish and elevate the
human.

00:22:42.589 --> 00:22:46.751
First, the fashioning of the
human from clay is--again--in

00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:49.380
that story, it's the climactic
or,

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.285
well not quite climactic,
it's the penultimate,

00:22:52.285 --> 00:22:54.369
I suppose, moment in the story.
 

00:22:54.369 --> 00:22:57.697
The final climactic act of
creation is the creation of the

00:22:57.697 --> 00:22:59.039
female from the male.
 

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:01.327
That is actually the peak of
creation, what can I say

00:23:01.327 --> 00:23:03.530
[laughter]?
Second and significantly,

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:06.660
not an afterthought,
it's the peak of creation!

00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.059
Second and significantly,
God himself blows the breath of

00:23:10.059 --> 00:23:11.759
life into Adam's nostrils.
 

00:23:11.759 --> 00:23:15.129
So while he fashions this clay
figure, this carcass

00:23:15.129 --> 00:23:18.970
actually--and then breathes
life, his own life into it.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.905
So, in the second creation
story just as in the first,

00:23:21.905 --> 00:23:25.173
there's a sacred imprint of
some kind that distinguishes the

00:23:25.173 --> 00:23:27.609
human creation from the other
creatures.

00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:31.687
So this idea that the human
being is a mixture of clay,

00:23:31.687 --> 00:23:35.691
he's molded from clay,
but enlivened by the breath of

00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:39.782
God, captures that paradoxical
mix of sort of earthly and

00:23:39.782 --> 00:23:43.710
divine elements,
dependence and freedom that

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.250
marks the human as unique.
 

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.457
It should further be noted that
in the first creation account,

00:23:50.457 --> 00:23:54.526
there's no implication that man
and woman are in any kind of

00:23:54.526 --> 00:23:57.009
unequal relationship before God.
 

00:23:57.009 --> 00:24:01.541
The Hebrew word that designates
the creature created by God is

00:24:01.541 --> 00:24:03.250
the word adam.
 

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:08.279
It's actually not a proper
name, small a;

00:24:08.279 --> 00:24:10.660
it is adam,
it's a generic term.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.119
It simply means human or more
precisely earthling because it

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:16.053
comes from the word
adamah,

00:24:16.053 --> 00:24:17.930
which means ground or earth.
 

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.058
So this is adam,
an earthling,

00:24:20.058 --> 00:24:22.720
a thing that has been taken
from the earth.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.301
Genesis 1 states that God
created the adam,

00:24:26.301 --> 00:24:29.819
with the definite article:
this is not a proper name.

00:24:29.819 --> 00:24:32.797
God created the adam,
the earthling,

00:24:32.797 --> 00:24:35.349
"male and female created he
them."

00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:38.961
That's a line that has vexed
commentators for centuries and

00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:42.200
has spawned many very
fascinating interpretations.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.475
And you will be reading some of
those in the readings that are

00:24:45.475 --> 00:24:48.751
assigned for section discussion
next week and I think having a

00:24:48.751 --> 00:24:50.470
great deal of fun with them.
 

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:54.053
Moreover, this earthling that
seems to include both male and

00:24:54.053 --> 00:24:57.029
female, is then said to be in
the image of God.

00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:59.986
So that suggests that the
ancient Israelites didn't

00:24:59.986 --> 00:25:03.180
conceive of God as gendered or
necessarily gendered.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.151
The adam,
the earthling,

00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:08.240
male and female was made in the
image of God.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.367
Even in the second creation
account, it's not clear that the

00:25:11.367 --> 00:25:13.170
woman is subordinate to the man.
 

00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.735
Many medieval Jewish
commentators enjoy pointing out

00:25:16.735 --> 00:25:20.930
that she was not made from his
head so that she not rule over

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.961
him,
but she wasn't made from his

00:25:22.961 --> 00:25:25.380
foot so that she would be
subservient to him;

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.657
she was made from his side so
that she would be a companion to

00:25:28.657 --> 00:25:30.284
him.
And the creation of woman,

00:25:30.284 --> 00:25:32.995
as I said, is in fact the
climactic creative act in the

00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:34.299
second Genesis account.
 

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:37.750
With her formation,
creation is now complete.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:41.668
So, the biblical creation
stories individually and jointly

00:25:41.668 --> 00:25:45.862
present a portrait of the human
as the pinnacle and purpose of

00:25:45.862 --> 00:25:49.932
creation: godlike in some way,
in possession of distinctive

00:25:49.932 --> 00:25:53.706
faculties and characteristics,
that equip them for stewardship

00:25:53.706 --> 00:25:56.119
over the world that God has
created.

00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:59.519
Finally, let's talk about the
image of the world that emerges

00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:01.730
from the creation story in
Genesis 1.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.500
In these stories,
there's a very strong emphasis

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.789
on the essential goodness of the
world.

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:12.710
Recall some of Kaufman's ideas
or categories again.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:16.247
One of the things he claims is
that in a polytheistic system,

00:26:16.247 --> 00:26:19.523
which is morally neutral,
where you have some primordial

00:26:19.523 --> 00:26:21.768
realm that spawns demons,
monsters, gods,

00:26:21.768 --> 00:26:23.619
evil is a permanent necessity.
 

00:26:23.619 --> 00:26:27.192
It's just built into the
structure of the cosmos because

00:26:27.192 --> 00:26:30.180
of the fact that all kinds of
divine beings,

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.427
good and bad,
are generated and locked in

00:26:33.427 --> 00:26:36.506
conflict.
So the world isn't essentially

00:26:36.506 --> 00:26:39.350
good in its nature or
essentially bad.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.170
Note the difference in Genesis.
 

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:45.540
After each act of creation what
does God say?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.039
"It is good," right?
 

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:49.413
Genesis 1 verse 4,
verse 10, verse 12,

00:26:49.413 --> 00:26:52.235
verse 18, verse 21,
verse 25… and after the

00:26:52.235 --> 00:26:56.213
creation of living things,
the text states that God found

00:26:56.213 --> 00:26:58.539
all that he made to be very
good.

00:26:58.539 --> 00:27:02.359
So there are seven occurrences
of the word "good" in Genesis.

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:03.640
That's something you want to
watch for.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.810
If you're reading a passage of
the Bible and you're noticing a

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:08.630
word coming up a lot,
count them.

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.744
There's probably going to be
seven or ten,

00:27:10.744 --> 00:27:11.930
they love doing that.
 

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:16.538
The sevenfold or the tenfold
repetition of a word--such a

00:27:16.538 --> 00:27:19.171
word is called a
leitwort,

00:27:19.171 --> 00:27:22.710
a recurring word that becomes
thematic.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.413
That's a favorite literary
technique of the biblical

00:27:25.413 --> 00:27:27.012
author.
So we read Genesis 1 and we

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:29.673
hear this recurring--"and it was
good… and he looked and it was

00:27:29.673 --> 00:27:31.420
good… and he looked and it was
good,"

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.290
and we have this tremendous
rush of optimism.

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:36.150
The world is good;
humans are important;

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.700
they have purpose and dignity.
 

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.671
The biblical writer is
rejecting the concept of a

00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:44.023
primordial evil,
a concept found in the

00:27:44.023 --> 00:27:46.500
literature of the Ancient Near
East.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.311
So for the biblical writer of
this story, it would seem that

00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:54.058
evil is not a metaphysical
reality built into the structure

00:27:54.058 --> 00:27:56.944
of the universe.
So all signs of a cosmic

00:27:56.944 --> 00:28:00.930
battle, or some primordial act
of violence between the forces

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:04.517
of chaos and evil and the forces
of cosmos and good are

00:28:04.517 --> 00:28:06.996
eliminated.
In Enuma Elish,

00:28:06.996 --> 00:28:10.729
cosmic order is achieved only
after a violent struggle with

00:28:10.729 --> 00:28:12.210
very hostile forces.
 

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.397
But in Genesis,
creation is not the result of a

00:28:15.397 --> 00:28:18.029
struggle between divine
antagonists.

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:23.306
God imposes order on the
demythologized elements that he

00:28:23.306 --> 00:28:26.759
finds: water,
but it's just water.

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:30.012
Let's look a little bit more
closely at Genesis 1 to make

00:28:30.012 --> 00:28:32.385
this case.
The chapter begins with a

00:28:32.385 --> 00:28:36.005
temporal clause which is
unfortunately often translated

00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:38.869
"In the beginning,"
which implies that what follows

00:28:38.869 --> 00:28:41.602
is going to give you an ultimate
account of the origins of the

00:28:41.602 --> 00:28:43.687
universe.
You sort of expect something

00:28:43.687 --> 00:28:46.671
like, "In the beginning,
God created heaven and earth,"

00:28:46.671 --> 00:28:49.490
like this was the first thing to
happen in time.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:53.300
So, that translation causes
people to believe that the story

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.240
is giving me an account of the
first event in time forward;

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.509
but it's actually a bad
translation.

00:28:59.509 --> 00:29:02.977
The Hebrew phrase that starts
the book of Genesis is pretty

00:29:02.977 --> 00:29:06.504
much exactly like the phrase
that starts Enuma Elish:

00:29:06.504 --> 00:29:09.446
"When on high,"
there was a whole bunch of

00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.809
water and stuff,
then suddenly this

00:29:11.809 --> 00:29:14.589
happened--very similar in the
Hebrew.

00:29:14.589 --> 00:29:18.396
It's better translated this
way: "When God began creating

00:29:18.396 --> 00:29:22.474
the heavens and the earth… he
said, 'Let there be light and

00:29:22.474 --> 00:29:25.879
there was light.'"
And that translation suggests

00:29:25.879 --> 00:29:29.829
that the story isn't concerned
to depict the ultimate origins

00:29:29.829 --> 00:29:32.819
of the universe.
It's interested in explaining

00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:35.279
how and why the world got the
way it is.

00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:38.035
When God began this process of
creating the heaven and the

00:29:38.035 --> 00:29:40.210
earth, and the earth was
unformed and void,

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:43.273
and his wind was on the surface
of the deep and so on,

00:29:43.273 --> 00:29:46.279
he said, "Let there be light
and there was light."

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:49.650
So, we find that,
in fact, something exists;

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:53.545
it has no shape.
So creation in Genesis 1 is not

00:29:53.545 --> 00:29:57.011
described as a process of making
something out of nothing:

00:29:57.011 --> 00:30:00.660
that's a notion referred to as
creation ex nihilo,

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.109
creation of something out of
utter nothing.

00:30:03.109 --> 00:30:06.121
It's instead a process of
organizing pre-existing

00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:09.759
materials and imposing order on
those chaotic materials.

00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:14.569
So we begin with this chaotic
mass and then there's the

00:30:14.569 --> 00:30:16.440
ruah of God.
 

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.996
Now sometimes this word "ruah"
is kind of anachronistically

00:30:20.996 --> 00:30:24.509
translated as "spirit";
it really doesn't mean that in

00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:25.440
the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:28.722
In later levels of Hebrew it
will start to mean that,

00:30:28.722 --> 00:30:31.690
but it is really "wind,"
ruah is wind.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:36.033
So: "when God began to create
heaven and earth--the earth

00:30:36.033 --> 00:30:40.531
being unformed and void," the
wind of God sweeping over the

00:30:40.531 --> 00:30:43.438
deep.
Remember the cosmic battle

00:30:43.438 --> 00:30:47.431
between Marduk and Tiamat:
Marduk the storm god,

00:30:47.431 --> 00:30:50.829
who released his wind against
Tiamat,

00:30:50.829 --> 00:30:53.908
the primeval deep,
the primeval water,

00:30:53.908 --> 00:30:56.819
representing the forces of
chaos.

00:30:56.819 --> 00:30:59.910
And you should immediately hear
the great similarities.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:04.417
Our story opens with a temporal
clause: "When on high," "when

00:31:04.417 --> 00:31:08.186
God began creating";
we have a wind that sweeps over

00:31:08.186 --> 00:31:11.122
chaotic waters,
just like the wind of Marduk

00:31:11.122 --> 00:31:13.579
released into the face of
Tiamat,

00:31:13.579 --> 00:31:16.960
and the Hebrew term is
particularly fascinating.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.671
In fact, the text says "and
there is darkness on the face of

00:31:21.671 --> 00:31:24.079
deep."
No definite article.

00:31:24.079 --> 00:31:27.850
The word "deep" is a
proper name, perhaps.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.430
The Hebrew word is Tehom.
 

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:33.807
It means "deep" and
etymologically it's exactly the

00:31:33.807 --> 00:31:36.711
same word as Tiamat:
the "at" ending is just

00:31:36.711 --> 00:31:39.728
feminine.
So Tiam, Tehom--it's the same

00:31:39.728 --> 00:31:41.720
word, it's a related word.
 

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.791
So, the wind over the face of
deep, now it's demythologized,

00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:49.932
so it's as if they're invoking
the story that would have been

00:31:49.932 --> 00:31:52.210
familiar and yet changing it.
 

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.767
So the storyteller has actually
set the stage for retelling the

00:31:55.767 --> 00:31:58.119
cosmic battle story that
everyone knew.

00:31:58.119 --> 00:32:01.007
That was a story that surely
was near and dear to the hearts

00:32:01.007 --> 00:32:04.140
of many ancient Israelites and
Ancient Near Eastern listeners,

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:07.480
so all the elements are there
for the retelling of that story.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.200
We've got wind,
we've got a primeval chaotic,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.549
watery mass or deep,
and then surprise,

00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:13.910
there's no battle.
 

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.849
There's just a word,
"let there be light."

00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:19.465
And the Ancient Near Eastern
listener would prick up their

00:32:19.465 --> 00:32:21.576
ears: where's the battle,
where's the violence,

00:32:21.576 --> 00:32:22.540
where's the gore?
 

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.079
I thought I knew this story.
 

00:32:24.079 --> 00:32:27.109
So something new,
something different was being

00:32:27.109 --> 00:32:29.019
communicated in this story.
 

00:32:29.019 --> 00:32:32.639
And don't think the biblical
writers didn't know this motif

00:32:32.639 --> 00:32:35.759
of creation following upon a
huge cosmic battle,

00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:39.519
particularly a battle with a
watery, dragon-like monster.

00:32:39.519 --> 00:32:43.349
There are many poetic passages
and poetic sections of the Bible

00:32:43.349 --> 00:32:47.180
that contain very clear and
explicit illusions to that myth.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:51.105
It was certainly known and told
to Israelite children and part

00:32:51.105 --> 00:32:53.720
of the culture.
We have it mentioned in Job;

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.787
we have it mentioned in the
following psalm,

00:32:56.787 --> 00:33:00.069
Psalm 74:12-17:
"O God, my king from of old,

00:33:00.069 --> 00:33:02.330
who brings deliverance
throughout the land;/it was You

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.079
who drove back the sea with Your
might,

00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:06.678
who smashed the heads of the
monsters in the waters;/it was

00:33:06.678 --> 00:33:08.560
You who crushed the heads of
Leviathan,"

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.902
a sea monster.
Other psalms also contain

00:33:11.902 --> 00:33:14.014
similar lines.
Isaiah 51:9-10:

00:33:14.014 --> 00:33:18.027
"It was you that hacked
Rahab"--this is another name of

00:33:18.027 --> 00:33:21.000
a primeval water monster--"in
pieces,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.026
/ That pierced the Dragon./It
was you that dried up the

00:33:24.026 --> 00:33:26.099
Sea,/The waters of the great
deep."

00:33:26.099 --> 00:33:28.561
These were familiar stories,
they were known in Israel,

00:33:28.561 --> 00:33:30.019
they were recounted in Israel.
 

00:33:30.019 --> 00:33:34.364
They were stories of a god who
violently slays the forces of

00:33:34.364 --> 00:33:38.192
chaos, represented as watery
dragons, as a prelude to

00:33:38.192 --> 00:33:42.220
creation.
And the rejection of this motif

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:47.470
or this idea in Genesis 1 is
pointed and purposeful.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:49.440
It's demythologization.
 

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.759
It's removal of the creation
account from the realm and the

00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:52.600
world of mythology.
 

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.650
It's pointed and purposeful.
 

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.978
It wants us to conceive of God
as an uncontested god who

00:33:57.978 --> 00:34:01.549
through the power of his word or
will creates the cosmos.

00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:04.701
And he follows that initial
ordering by setting up celestial

00:34:04.701 --> 00:34:06.250
bodies, just as Marduk did.
 

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:08.894
They're not in themselves,
however, divinities:

00:34:08.894 --> 00:34:10.849
they are merely God's
creations.

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:14.384
In the biblical text,
the firmament appears to be a

00:34:14.384 --> 00:34:18.414
beaten, the word in Hebrew is
something that's been beaten

00:34:18.414 --> 00:34:20.513
out,
like a metal worker would

00:34:20.513 --> 00:34:22.599
hammer out a thin sheet of
metal.

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:25.480
And that's what the firmament
this by the way is the portrait

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.918
of the world;
it looks a lot like my map of

00:34:27.918 --> 00:34:30.110
the Ancient Near East,
but it's not.

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.337
So you have this firmament,
which is beaten back to hold

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:35.920
back primeval waters that are
pressing in;

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.809
you have land which is holding
down the waters here.

00:34:38.809 --> 00:34:42.260
We inhabit the bubble that's
created in that way.

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.969
That's the image in Enuma
Elish and it's the image of

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:47.216
Genesis 1.
And later on when God gets mad

00:34:47.216 --> 00:34:49.591
he's going to open up some
windows up here,

00:34:49.591 --> 00:34:51.739
right, and it's all going to
flood.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.110
That's what's going to happen
in the Flood.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:56.170
That's the image of the world
that you're working with.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.963
So, the firmament is sort of
like an inverted bowl,

00:34:58.963 --> 00:35:01.980
a beaten-out sheet of metal
that's an inverted bowl,

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:04.265
and again as I said:
echoes of Enuma Elish,

00:35:04.265 --> 00:35:06.830
where you have Marduk dividing
the carcass of Tiamat,

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.289
like a shellfish.
 

00:35:08.289 --> 00:35:13.422
He separates the waters above
and the waters below and creates

00:35:13.422 --> 00:35:17.630
this space that will become the
inhabited world.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:21.658
Now the story of creation in
Genesis 1 takes place over seven

00:35:21.658 --> 00:35:25.619
days, and there's a certain
logic and parallelism to the six

00:35:25.619 --> 00:35:27.030
days of creating.
 

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:29.719
And I've written those
parallels here.

00:35:29.719 --> 00:35:32.420
There's a parallel between day
one, day four;

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.449
day two and five;
day three and six.

00:35:35.449 --> 00:35:39.500
On day one, light and dark are
separated.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.780
On day four,
the heavenly bodies that give

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.980
off light by day or night are
created.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.920
On day two, the firmament is
established.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:52.245
That water is separated,
that bubble has opened up so

00:35:52.245 --> 00:35:56.017
we've got the sky created and
we've got the waters collected

00:35:56.017 --> 00:35:59.400
in certain areas down here,
and we've got sky.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.936
On day five,
the inhabitants of the skies

00:36:01.936 --> 00:36:04.789
and the waters are created,
birds and fish.

00:36:04.789 --> 00:36:07.723
On day three,
land is formed to make dry

00:36:07.723 --> 00:36:09.980
spots from the waters below.
 

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.864
So you have land being formed
on day three,

00:36:12.864 --> 00:36:16.848
it's separated out from the sea
and on day six you have the

00:36:16.848 --> 00:36:18.840
creation of land animals.
 

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.054
But days three and six each
have an extra element,

00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:25.661
and the fact that the first
elements here pair up nicely

00:36:25.661 --> 00:36:29.531
with each other suggests that
the extra element on day three

00:36:29.531 --> 00:36:33.466
and the extra element on day six
might also be paired in some

00:36:33.466 --> 00:36:35.796
important way.
On day three,

00:36:35.796 --> 00:36:39.139
vegetation is produced,
is created, and on day six

00:36:39.139 --> 00:36:43.300
humans are created after the
creation of the land animals.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.699
So the implication is that the
vegetation is for the humans.

00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:51.467
And indeed, it's expressly
stated by God that humans are to

00:36:51.467 --> 00:36:56.071
be given every fruit bearing
tree and seed bearing plant,

00:36:56.071 --> 00:36:58.620
fruits and grains for food.
 

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.809
That's in Genesis 1:29.
 

00:37:00.809 --> 00:37:02.309
That's what you are going to
eat.

00:37:02.309 --> 00:37:08.277
There's no mention of chicken
or beef, there's no mention made

00:37:08.277 --> 00:37:10.429
of animals for food.
 

00:37:10.429 --> 00:37:13.933
In Genesis 1:30,
God says that the animals are

00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:17.747
being given the green plants,
the grass and herbs,

00:37:17.747 --> 00:37:19.716
for food.
In other words,

00:37:19.716 --> 00:37:22.329
there should be no competition
for food.

00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:25.345
Humans have fruit and
grain-bearing vegetation,

00:37:25.345 --> 00:37:28.230
animals have the herbiage and
the grasses.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:31.396
There is no excuse to live in
anything but a peaceful

00:37:31.396 --> 00:37:33.739
co-existence.
Therefore, humans,

00:37:33.739 --> 00:37:37.473
according to Genesis 1,
were created vegetarian,

00:37:37.473 --> 00:37:41.162
and in every respect,
the original creation is

00:37:41.162 --> 00:37:45.470
imagined as free of bloodshed
and violence of every kind.

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:47.699
"And God saw… very good."
 

00:37:47.699 --> 00:37:50.412
So on the seventh day,
God rested from his labors and

00:37:50.412 --> 00:37:53.386
for this reason he blessed the
seventh day and declared it

00:37:53.386 --> 00:37:55.445
"holy."
This is a word we'll be coming

00:37:55.445 --> 00:37:58.368
back to in about five or six
lectures, talking about what it

00:37:58.368 --> 00:38:00.726
is to be holy,
but right now it essentially

00:38:00.726 --> 00:38:02.079
means it belongs to God.
 

00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:04.011
If something's holy,
it doesn't belong to you,

00:38:04.011 --> 00:38:04.869
it belongs to God.
 

00:38:04.869 --> 00:38:08.482
And part of the purpose of this
story is to explain the origin

00:38:08.482 --> 00:38:11.384
of the observance of the
Sabbath, the seventh day,

00:38:11.384 --> 00:38:14.174
as a holy day.
So this is a myth in the sense

00:38:14.174 --> 00:38:17.679
that it's explaining some custom
or ritual among the people.

00:38:17.679 --> 00:38:21.829
So Israelite accounts of
creation contain clear allusions

00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:25.980
to and resonances of Ancient
Near Eastern cosmogonies;

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.182
but perhaps Genesis 1 can best
be described as demythologizing

00:38:30.182 --> 00:38:32.800
what was a common cultural
heritage.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.391
There's a clear tendency in
this story towards monotheism in

00:38:36.391 --> 00:38:39.070
the abstract terms that Kaufman
described.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.505
A transformation of widely
known stories to express a

00:38:42.505 --> 00:38:45.875
monotheistic worldview is
clearly important to these

00:38:45.875 --> 00:38:49.397
particular biblical writers,
and we'll be talking later

00:38:49.397 --> 00:38:52.701
about who these writers were who
wrote Genesis 1 as opposed to

00:38:52.701 --> 00:38:55.156
Genesis 2 and 3.
But these stories rival,

00:38:55.156 --> 00:38:57.890
and implicitly polemicize
against, the myths or

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:00.090
mythologies of Israel's
neighbors.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.857
They reject certain elements
but they almost reject them by

00:39:02.857 --> 00:39:03.860
incorporating them.
 

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.090
They incorporate and modify
them.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:10.462
So, one of the things I've
tried to claim in describing

00:39:10.462 --> 00:39:15.239
Genesis 1 is that in this story
evil is represented not as a

00:39:15.239 --> 00:39:16.940
physical reality.
 

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.210
It's not built into the
structure of the world.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.686
When God rests he's looking at
the whole thing,

00:39:21.686 --> 00:39:23.840
it's very good,
it's set up very well.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.829
And yet we know that evil is a
condition of human existence.

00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:30.269
It's a reality of life,
so how do we account for it?

00:39:30.269 --> 00:39:32.774
And the Garden of Eden story,
I think, seeks to answer that

00:39:32.774 --> 00:39:34.730
question.
It actually does a whole bunch

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.752
of things, but one thing it
does, I think,

00:39:36.752 --> 00:39:41.005
is try to answer that question,
and to assert that evil stems

00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:42.869
from human behavior.
 

00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:46.361
God created a good world,
but humans in the exercise of

00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:49.659
their moral autonomy,
they have the power to corrupt

00:39:49.659 --> 00:39:52.181
the good.
So, the Garden of Eden story

00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:55.905
communicates what Kaufman would
identify as a basic idea of the

00:39:55.905 --> 00:39:59.089
monotheistic worldview:
that evil isn't a metaphysical

00:39:59.089 --> 00:40:01.949
reality,
it's a moral reality.

00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:05.125
What that means ultimately is
that evil lacks inevitability,

00:40:05.125 --> 00:40:07.440
depending on your theory of
human nature,

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:12.245
I suppose, and it also means
that evil lies within the realm

00:40:12.245 --> 00:40:15.340
of human responsibility and
control.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.534
Now Nahum Sarna,
the scholar whose work I

00:40:17.534 --> 00:40:20.168
referred to earlier,
he points out that there's a

00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:23.350
very important distinction
between the Garden of Eden story

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.820
and its Ancient Near Eastern
parallels.

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:29.670
He says the motif of a tree of
life or a plant of life or a

00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:33.049
plant of eternal youth,
that's a motif that we do find

00:40:33.049 --> 00:40:36.315
in other Ancient Near Eastern
literatures, in Ancient Near

00:40:36.315 --> 00:40:38.780
Eastern myth and ritual and
iconography,

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:43.201
and the quest for such a plant,
or the quest for immortality

00:40:43.201 --> 00:40:47.189
that the plant promises,
that these were primary themes

00:40:47.189 --> 00:40:49.840
in the Mesopotamian Epic of
Gilgamesh.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.260
 
 

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.739
We'll have occasion to talk in
great depth about this story

00:40:56.739 --> 00:40:58.327
next time.
But by contrast,

00:40:58.327 --> 00:41:01.582
Sarna says, we haven't as yet
uncovered a parallel in Ancient

00:41:01.582 --> 00:41:04.836
Near Eastern literature to the
biblical tree of the knowledge

00:41:04.836 --> 00:41:06.030
of good and evil.
 

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.522
It's not the tree of knowledge,
it's the tree of the knowledge

00:41:09.522 --> 00:41:11.869
of good and evil--it's a longer
phrase.

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:14.987
What is the significance of the
fact that the Bible mentions

00:41:14.987 --> 00:41:16.150
both of these trees?
 

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.206
It mentions a tree of life and
the tree of the knowledge of

00:41:19.206 --> 00:41:21.320
good and evil;
and then goes on to just focus

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.309
on the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil.

00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:25.982
It virtually ignores the tree
of life until we get to the end

00:41:25.982 --> 00:41:27.630
of the story,
and that's important.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:31.977
But this tree of life which
seems to be central to many

00:41:31.977 --> 00:41:36.728
other myths of this time and
this part of the world… Sarna

00:41:36.728 --> 00:41:41.801
argues that the subordinate role
of the tree of life signals the

00:41:41.801 --> 00:41:46.229
biblical writer's dissociation
from a preoccupation with

00:41:46.229 --> 00:41:49.721
immortality.
The biblical writer insists

00:41:49.721 --> 00:41:54.179
that the central concern of life
is not mortality but morality.

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:58.282
And the drama of human life
should revolve not around the

00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:02.385
search for eternal life but
around the moral conflict and

00:42:02.385 --> 00:42:06.781
tension between a good god's
design for creation and the free

00:42:06.781 --> 00:42:11.250
will of human beings that can
corrupt that good design.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:15.653
The serpent tells Eve that if
she eats the fruit of the tree

00:42:15.653 --> 00:42:20.280
of the knowledge of good and
evil, she will become like God.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.449
And he's really not telling a
lie, in a certain respect.

00:42:24.449 --> 00:42:27.460
And God knows that,
that human beings will become

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:29.530
like God knowing good and evil.
 

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:34.220
It's one of the things about
God: he knows good and evil and

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.969
has chosen the good.
 

00:42:35.969 --> 00:42:40.375
The biblical writer asserts of
this god that he is absolutely

00:42:40.375 --> 00:42:41.952
good.
The humans will become like

00:42:41.952 --> 00:42:44.116
gods, knowing good and evil,
not because of some magical

00:42:44.116 --> 00:42:46.106
property in this fruit;
and it's not an apple,

00:42:46.106 --> 00:42:48.700
by the way, that's based on an
interesting mistranslation.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.760
Do we know what the fruit is?
 

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.167
No, I don't think we really
know but it's definitely not an

00:42:52.167 --> 00:42:54.044
apple.
That comes from the Latin word

00:42:54.044 --> 00:42:56.824
which sounds like apple,
the word malum for evil

00:42:56.824 --> 00:43:00.170
is close to the Latin word for
apple which if anybody knows...

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:03.756
whatever.
And so iconography began to

00:43:03.756 --> 00:43:06.373
represent this tree as an apple
tree and so on,

00:43:06.373 --> 00:43:08.079
but it's not an apple tree.
 

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:10.575
I don't know if they had apple
trees back then,

00:43:10.575 --> 00:43:12.846
there!
But it's not because of some

00:43:12.846 --> 00:43:16.455
magical property in the fruit
itself, but because of the

00:43:16.455 --> 00:43:18.619
action of disobedience itself.
 

00:43:18.619 --> 00:43:22.114
By choosing to eat of the fruit
in defiance of God--this is the

00:43:22.114 --> 00:43:24.199
one thing God says,
"Don't do this!

00:43:24.199 --> 00:43:27.353
You can have everything else in
this garden," presumably,

00:43:27.353 --> 00:43:30.000
even, you can eat of the tree
of life, right?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.820
It doesn't say you can't eat of
that.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.820
Who's to say they couldn't eat
of that and just live forever?

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.059
Don't eat of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil.

00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:41.516
Student: Is there any
sort of an explanation for why

00:43:41.516 --> 00:43:45.150
God says you can't eat of this
tree when he's given all of the

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:46.699
fruit bearing trees...
 

00:43:46.699 --> 00:43:48.824
Professor Christine
Hayes: There have been

00:43:48.824 --> 00:43:51.435
about--how many thousands of
years of speculation--on what's

00:43:51.435 --> 00:43:53.825
going on and you're going to be
reading a wonderful and

00:43:53.825 --> 00:43:55.639
interesting gnostic
interpretation.

00:43:55.639 --> 00:43:57.297
And so, yep,
there's been lots of

00:43:57.297 --> 00:44:00.093
interesting… and this is all
in the realm of literary

00:44:00.093 --> 00:44:02.320
interpretation:
read the story closely,

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.140
see if you can figure out
what's going on here.

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.750
Why does God do this?
 

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.017
Isn't this, in a way,
putting an obstacle in front of

00:44:08.017 --> 00:44:10.460
someone almost ensuring they're
going to trip over it?

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.200
That's been an argument that
some commentators have made.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.920
Others see it differently.
 

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.797
So, keep that thought,
take it to section and read

00:44:17.797 --> 00:44:21.320
Elaine Pagels' work and some of
the other interpretations.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.457
That's something that people
have struggled with for

00:44:23.457 --> 00:44:24.739
centuries.
Where does this come from?

00:44:24.739 --> 00:44:26.050
Who's the serpent and what's he
doing there?

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:27.949
They're all very important.
 

00:44:27.949 --> 00:44:31.572
It is true--and maybe this will
go a little bit of the distance

00:44:31.572 --> 00:44:35.077
towards answering it--it's by
eating of the fruit in defiance

00:44:35.077 --> 00:44:37.018
of God,
human beings learn that they

00:44:37.018 --> 00:44:39.106
were able to do that,
that they are free moral

00:44:39.106 --> 00:44:41.010
agents.
They find that out.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:44.297
They're able to choose their
actions in conformity with God's

00:44:44.297 --> 00:44:46.269
will or in defiance of God's
will.

00:44:46.269 --> 00:44:49.198
So paradoxically,
they learn that they have moral

00:44:49.198 --> 00:44:51.627
autonomy.
Remember, they were made in the

00:44:51.627 --> 00:44:54.972
image of God and they learn that
they have moral autonomy by

00:44:54.972 --> 00:44:58.260
making the defiant choice,
the choice for disobedience.

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:00.930
The argument could be made that
until they once disobeyed,

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:02.429
how would they ever know that?
 

00:45:02.429 --> 00:45:04.763
And then you might raise all
sorts of questions about,

00:45:04.763 --> 00:45:07.229
well, was this part of God's
plan that they ought to know

00:45:07.229 --> 00:45:09.719
this and should know this,
so that their choice for good

00:45:09.719 --> 00:45:10.889
actually becomes meaningful.
 

00:45:10.889 --> 00:45:13.311
Is it meaningful to choose to
do the good when you have no

00:45:13.311 --> 00:45:15.987
choice to do otherwise or aren't
aware that you have a choice to

00:45:15.987 --> 00:45:17.836
do otherwise?
So, there's a wonderful

00:45:17.836 --> 00:45:20.532
thirteenth-century commentator
that says that God needed

00:45:20.532 --> 00:45:22.590
creatures who could choose to
obey him,

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:25.941
and therefore it was important
for Adam and Eve to do what they

00:45:25.941 --> 00:45:29.130
did and to learn that they had
the choice not to obey God so

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.590
that their choice for God would
become endowed with meaning.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:34.938
That's one line of
interpretation that's gone

00:45:34.938 --> 00:45:37.980
through many theological systems
for hundreds of years.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.902
So the very action that brought
them a godlike awareness of

00:45:41.902 --> 00:45:45.352
their moral autonomy was an
action that was taken in

00:45:45.352 --> 00:45:46.840
opposition to God.
 

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.198
So we see then that having
knowledge of good and evil is no

00:45:50.198 --> 00:45:53.730
guarantee that one will choose
or incline towards the good.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:56.409
That's what the serpent omitted
in his speech.

00:45:56.409 --> 00:45:59.519
He said if you eat of that
fruit, of the tree of the

00:45:59.519 --> 00:46:02.750
knowledge of good and evil,
you'll become like God.

00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:05.010
It's true in one sense but it's
false in another.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.958
He sort of omitted to point
out… he implies that it's the

00:46:08.958 --> 00:46:12.090
power of moral choice alone that
is godlike.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:15.484
But the biblical writer will
claim in many places that true

00:46:15.484 --> 00:46:18.586
godliness isn't simply power,
the power to do what one

00:46:18.586 --> 00:46:21.174
wishes.
True godliness means imitation

00:46:21.174 --> 00:46:24.673
of God, the exercise of one's
power in a manner that is

00:46:24.673 --> 00:46:27.460
godlike, good,
life-affirming and so on.

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:30.557
So, it's the biblical writer's
contention that the god of

00:46:30.557 --> 00:46:33.488
Israel is not only all-powerful
but is essentially and

00:46:33.488 --> 00:46:34.650
necessarily good.
 

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:36.640
Those two elements cannot
become disjoined,

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.579
they must always be conjoined
in the biblical writer's view.

00:46:39.579 --> 00:46:41.807
And finally,
humans will learn that the

00:46:41.807 --> 00:46:44.679
concomitant of their freedom is
responsibility.

00:46:44.679 --> 00:46:47.139
Their first act of defiance is
punished harshly.

00:46:47.139 --> 00:46:49.942
So they learn in this story
that the moral choices and

00:46:49.942 --> 00:46:52.586
actions of humans have
consequences that have to be

00:46:52.586 --> 00:46:54.119
borne by the perpetrator.
 

00:46:54.119 --> 00:46:57.612
So, just to sum up,
Sarna sees in the Garden of

00:46:57.612 --> 00:47:00.650
Eden story, as I've just
explained it,

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.216
a message that's in line with
Kaufman's thesis about the

00:47:03.216 --> 00:47:04.429
monotheistic world view.
 

00:47:04.429 --> 00:47:08.378
He says this story conveys the
idea that, "…evil is a product

00:47:08.378 --> 00:47:11.499
of human behavior,
not a principal inherent in the

00:47:11.499 --> 00:47:13.842
cosmos.
Man's disobedience is the cause

00:47:13.842 --> 00:47:15.219
of the human predicament.
 

00:47:15.219 --> 00:47:18.697
Human freedom can be at one and
the same time an omen of

00:47:18.697 --> 00:47:21.480
disaster and a challenge and
opportunity".

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:24.809
We've looked at Genesis 2 and 3
a little bit as an attempt to

00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:28.139
account for the problematic and
paradoxical existence of evil

00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:30.969
and suffering in a world created
by a good god,

00:47:30.969 --> 00:47:33.818
and that's a problem monotheism
really never completely

00:47:33.818 --> 00:47:37.090
conquers, but other perspectives
on this story are possible.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.337
And when we come back on
Monday, we're going to look at

00:47:39.337 --> 00:47:41.709
it from an entirely different
point of view and compare it

00:47:41.709 --> 00:47:43.000
with the Epic of Gilgamesh.

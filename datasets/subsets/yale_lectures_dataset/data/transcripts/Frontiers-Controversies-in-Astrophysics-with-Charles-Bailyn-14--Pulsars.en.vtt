00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.326
Professor Charles
Bailyn: I've been talking

00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:05.727
about general relativity,
and in particular,

00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:08.240
the post-Newtonian,
relativistic effects.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.691
These are the first things that
happen as the gravitational

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:17.372
field becomes strong enough that
Newton's laws don't perfectly

00:00:17.372 --> 00:00:19.957
apply.
And let me just summarize

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:24.392
those, because we're going to
see them all in action in just a

00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:29.880
minute.
So, here are the post-Newtonian

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.280
effects of general relativity.
And the first of them is the

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.690
precession of the perihelion.
I'm just going to list these.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.227
And this was seen in the
nineteenth century already,

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:53.570
and correctly interpreted by
Einstein.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.100
It had to do with Mercury's
orbit.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.596
I should say,
this word, perihelion,

00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:01.520
that means closest approach to
the Sun.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.545
And so, that only applies for
planets if you have the

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:08.210
same--you can have the same kind
of effect in binary stars or in

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.723
other things,
in which case,

00:01:10.723 --> 00:01:14.860
you might--they call it a
periastron.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.870
That's the closest approach to
a star that isn't the Sun.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.112
Or, here's a favorite word of
mine: perigalacticon,

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:29.662
I like that one.
That's the closest approach to

00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:33.179
a galaxy.
You can have--the other side of

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.323
the orbit that is 180 degrees
away from the perigalacticon,

00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:41.959
that's called the
anti-perigalacticon.

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.073
And you are challenged to use
that in a sentence at any time

00:01:46.073 --> 00:01:48.708
over break.
Anyone who successfully does

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.855
that, send me an email
recounting the circumstances,

00:01:51.855 --> 00:01:54.879
and I'll give you an extra
point or something.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:58.799
All right, so,
precession of the perihelion,

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.989
that's one post-Newtonian
effect.

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:07.092
Another post-Newtonian effect
is the deflection of light by

00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:11.403
mass, just because mass curves
space-time, and so,

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:15.009
light will follow a curved path
also.

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.876
This was first demonstrated in
1919 by the famous eclipse

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:20.810
observations of Eddington.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.458
And it also has been manifested
recently in the discovery of

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:35.792
so-called gravitational lenses,
of various kinds,

00:02:35.792 --> 00:02:41.908
in which the appearance of an
object is distorted by the fact

00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:48.126
that the light from that object
has to pass by some other mass

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:52.180
on its way to your eye.
And so, I have a couple

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.477
examples, here,
which I'd like to show you of

00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:55.730
gravitational lenses.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.030
This is the famous Einstein
cross, so-called.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.027
And what this is,
this is just a picture,

00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:13.250
I think, from the Hubble Space
Telescope.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.940
And these four objects,
here, are the same object.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.236
That's a quasar.
It's just, for this purpose,

00:03:21.236 --> 00:03:25.099
a point of light in the sky.
But it's located--its true

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.173
location is behind this thing.
This is much closer to you than

00:03:29.173 --> 00:03:32.975
any of these guys.
This is a galaxy about partway

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:36.742
between us and the quasar.
And what has happened is,

00:03:36.742 --> 00:03:39.865
if there were no deflection of
light, you'd see this quasar,

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:41.770
kind of, right behind the
galaxy.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.152
And in fact,
it would be hard to distinguish

00:03:44.152 --> 00:03:46.631
between the two.
But what has happened is,

00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:50.008
because there's this galaxy in
the way, the light from the

00:03:50.008 --> 00:03:53.622
quasar starts coming this way
and then bends around the galaxy

00:03:53.622 --> 00:03:56.964
and comes back toward us.
And the same is true up here

00:03:56.964 --> 00:03:58.639
and down here,
and down here.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.980
And so, you get four different
images of this quasar--of the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.216
same quasar.
And they know it's the same

00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:07.450
quasar, because they've taken
spectra of the thing,

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.773
and it's the exact same
spectrum on all four of these

00:04:09.773 --> 00:04:12.427
things.
And so, these are just four

00:04:12.427 --> 00:04:15.330
different images of the same
object.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.194
And the reason they're not
symmetrically distributed,

00:04:18.194 --> 00:04:21.498
here, is because the mass in
this galaxy is not symmetrically

00:04:21.498 --> 00:04:24.267
distributed.
And so, depending on what path

00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:27.540
you take, you get different
amounts of deflections.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.140
So, that's a classic example of
gravitational lens.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.615
Yes?
Student: Why can't we

00:04:32.615 --> 00:04:33.649
also see this quasar in the
middle?

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:35.766
Professor Charles
Bailyn: In principle,

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:37.459
you could see it,
right through here,

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:40.610
but there are two things about
the path that comes right at us.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.629
There are two problems with
that.

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.628
One is that for various--these
guys are all magnified,

00:04:46.628 --> 00:04:51.079
and the one that comes through
the middle is demagnified.

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:53.395
Second of all,
it's right in back of the

00:04:53.395 --> 00:04:54.817
galaxy.
But, in principle,

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:57.430
there's a fifth one down in the
middle, that's true.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.629
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:02.540
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Sorry?

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.851
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:06.474
Bailyn: Okay,
so what--let me,

00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:08.343
let me pause,
here, and tell you what a

00:05:08.343 --> 00:05:11.953
quasar is.
A quasar is a quasi-stellar

00:05:11.953 --> 00:05:13.724
object.
What it is, is,

00:05:13.724 --> 00:05:17.399
it's a very bright source right
in the middle of a galaxy.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:21.760
And so, it's actually a point
source of light.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.075
It looks like a star.
These things turns out to

00:05:24.075 --> 00:05:25.923
be--what they really are,
it turns out,

00:05:25.923 --> 00:05:28.500
are massive black holes in the
center of galaxies,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.949
accreting material from the
galaxy itself.

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.769
But they appear to be very
bright nuclei of galaxies and if

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:41.774
you could look really hard,
you could see the galaxy--the

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.810
background galaxy around this
thing.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.750
But in this particular case,
it's way too faint to see.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.567
The galaxy has a much larger
extent, because it's all the

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:53.430
stars and all the stuff in the
galaxies.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.970
It's not coming right from the
middle.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.545
And this one's much closer than
those, and so,

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:01.750
you can actually see that it's
extended, in this case.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.912
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:06:03.912 --> 00:06:05.705
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh,

00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:08.420
it's not the black hole that's
emitting the light.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.728
It's the material falling into
the black hole that gets heated

00:06:11.728 --> 00:06:13.602
up.
I'll actually talk about this

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:17.428
on Thursday a little bit.
Other questions about the

00:06:17.428 --> 00:06:19.530
Einstein cross,
here?

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.430
Let me show you another one.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.721
So, this is a Hubble Space
Telescope picture of a cluster

00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:30.197
of galaxies.
See all these different things,

00:06:30.197 --> 00:06:32.676
all these extended sources,
those are all individual

00:06:32.676 --> 00:06:34.729
galaxies.
Galaxies, it turns out,

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.740
come in clusters.
And so, here is a big bunch of

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.076
galaxies.
And some of the galaxies you

00:06:40.076 --> 00:06:43.143
see here--most of the galaxies,
all these big ones,

00:06:43.143 --> 00:06:46.443
are part of this cluster.
This is a cluster that's

00:06:46.443 --> 00:06:49.930
relatively nearby to Earth.
But some of the galaxies are

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.210
actually not in the cluster.
They're much, much further away.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.310
They're in back of the cluster.
And these things--these,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.436
sort of, streaky things you see
all over the place here--what

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:03.508
these are,
are galaxies that are in back

00:07:03.508 --> 00:07:07.564
of the cluster of galaxies,
whose light has been lensed

00:07:07.564 --> 00:07:11.320
when it passes through the
cluster of galaxies.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.910
And it's been stretched.
It's because,

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.917
what happened is,
this thing here,

00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:18.166
for example,
ought to be a tiny little

00:07:18.166 --> 00:07:20.660
galaxy that you can barely see
here,

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.020
except the light from the top
end of that galaxy got bent up

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.455
to here.
And the light from the bottom

00:07:27.455 --> 00:07:29.910
end of that galaxy got bent down
to here.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.450
And that's why they're all sort
of in this kind of--all these

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.110
things are kind of circular
around the center of this thing,

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.209
because this is a very,
very massive galaxy.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:41.529
And that's the thing that's
doing the lensing.

00:07:41.529 --> 00:07:45.607
And so, it effectively distorts
the shape of the background

00:07:45.607 --> 00:07:47.988
galaxy.
And you can see a couple more

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:50.519
of them around this massive
galaxy, here.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:54.795
These are pretty,
but they also can be used in

00:07:54.795 --> 00:07:59.925
order to understand the
distribution of mass inside the

00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:03.636
galaxy cluster.
Because the particular way in

00:08:03.636 --> 00:08:07.120
which these galaxies are
distorted depends on how much

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.750
mass there is in this galaxy
cluster,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.949
and how that mass is
distributed.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:18.573
And so, these are used to study
the mass distributions of galaxy

00:08:18.573 --> 00:08:21.908
clusters.
And so, this is a different

00:08:21.908 --> 00:08:25.713
kind of gravitational lensing.
And finally,

00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:30.428
let me show you a joke.
This is a picture of The

00:08:30.428 --> 00:08:34.030
Smithsonian Institute in
Washington, D.C.,

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.973
where there are a group--well,
actually, The Smithsonian

00:08:37.973 --> 00:08:40.060
Astrophysical Observatory is
actually in Cambridge,

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.551
Massachusetts.
And there, there are a group of

00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:44.850
people who study gravitational
lensing.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.759
And they have taken this
picture.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:50.057
And imagine what it would look
like if, about halfway between

00:08:50.057 --> 00:08:53.190
where you're looking and this
building, there were a black

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.759
hole the mass of Saturn.
And here's what it looks like.

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:02.184
And all these distortions are
simply due to the change in

00:09:02.184 --> 00:09:06.134
direction caused by the
gravitational force of this

00:09:06.134 --> 00:09:10.004
imaginary black hole.
And so, you could see what

00:09:10.004 --> 00:09:11.479
happens.
The black hole is,

00:09:11.479 --> 00:09:13.210
sort of, right down the middle,
here.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.141
And so, off at the edges,
there's only a little bit of

00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:17.824
distortion.
And then, in the middle,

00:09:17.824 --> 00:09:21.590
everything goes haywire.
Let me take this back a notch.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.342
Take a look at these two
central towers,

00:09:24.342 --> 00:09:26.529
this one, here,
and that one.

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:29.509
And so, they're kind of--what's
happened, here,

00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:33.265
is that you're seeing light
that has gone out and then been

00:09:33.265 --> 00:09:36.182
bent back towards you,
so, it looks like the tower's

00:09:36.182 --> 00:09:38.868
over here.
But look, that same tower is

00:09:38.868 --> 00:09:41.895
down here.
And so, that's light from the

00:09:41.895 --> 00:09:45.835
tower that went down and
underneath the black hole and

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:49.179
then got pulled back up to reach
your eye.

00:09:49.179 --> 00:09:51.848
So, there are two paths from
that tower to your eye,

00:09:51.848 --> 00:09:54.930
and you can see both of them.
Look at this thing here.

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.823
What's that?
Let me go back to the original

00:09:57.823 --> 00:10:00.250
picture.
That's this statue.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.214
And what's happened is,
light from the top of the

00:10:03.214 --> 00:10:06.672
statue has gone up and over the
black hole, and come down

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:10.529
towards you.
Whoops--and so, here it is.

00:10:10.529 --> 00:10:13.630
And similarly,
the clouds that were up here

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:17.986
have been bent down--have gone
underneath the black hole and

00:10:17.986 --> 00:10:21.529
been bent back up,
so you can see them here.

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:24.193
And so, they worked out all the
distortions of this,

00:10:24.193 --> 00:10:27.169
and so, they like to show this
kind of amusing picture.

00:10:27.169 --> 00:10:30.692
They actually had a movie,
which I couldn't find on the

00:10:30.692 --> 00:10:33.039
Net, last night,
which is too bad,

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:35.963
where they take the black hole,
and they kind of move it across

00:10:35.963 --> 00:10:38.545
the front of this thing.
You can see all the distortions

00:10:38.545 --> 00:10:41.179
coming out.
And so, you can have enormous

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:44.283
fun with this kind of thing.
Needless to say,

00:10:44.283 --> 00:10:47.824
this is not--this particular
picture has not ever actually

00:10:47.824 --> 00:10:50.978
been observed.
That's calculated,

00:10:50.978 --> 00:10:55.800
not actually observed.
But, you can see the kinds of

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.121
bizarre effects that
gravitational lensing can

00:10:59.121 --> 00:10:59.860
create.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.858
And, as I mentioned,
in some cases,

00:11:05.858 --> 00:11:08.650
these are scientifically useful
things, because you can

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.546
determine the distribution of
the mass that's causing the

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.570
lensing.
Questions? Yes?

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.257
Student: So in that
particular case it's always

00:11:17.257 --> 00:11:19.901
[Inaudible]
that all the light from the

00:11:19.901 --> 00:11:22.629
other side get lensed?
Professor Charles

00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:24.836
Bailyn: Well,
what you have to do--it depends

00:11:24.836 --> 00:11:27.549
a little bit on the exact mass
distribution of the lens.

00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:29.247
In this case,
I think they're assuming a

00:11:29.247 --> 00:11:30.754
point source.
And so, it is,

00:11:30.754 --> 00:11:33.990
in general, true that if
there's a gravitational lens,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:37.470
you end up seeing more light
than you otherwise would,

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.580
because it's focused in towards
you.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.941
So, the total amount of light
that you see,

00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:43.909
if you're seeing a lensed
object,

00:11:43.909 --> 00:11:47.202
is typically larger than the
amount you would see in the

00:11:47.202 --> 00:11:49.899
absence of the lens.
So, there are more paths of

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:52.862
light that are curved towards
you than are curved away from

00:11:52.862 --> 00:11:54.950
you.
If you're standing over on the

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.431
side, you'll lose a little bit
of the light,

00:11:57.431 --> 00:12:00.490
because it will be curved in
some other direction.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.549
And so, there are more
different way--you can see the

00:12:03.549 --> 00:12:06.315
thing--you know,
it's kind of an early twentieth

00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:09.286
century art thing.
You can see the same object

00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:12.888
from two different sides at
once, and you get these curious

00:12:12.888 --> 00:12:15.009
distortions.
Yes?

00:12:15.009 --> 00:12:17.532
Student: If you're
looking into a galaxy cluster

00:12:17.532 --> 00:12:20.288
and there are a lot of streaks
and a lot of galaxies and you

00:12:20.288 --> 00:12:22.904
don't know the mass of the
galaxy to try to find the mass

00:12:22.904 --> 00:12:24.352
[Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:12:24.352 --> 00:12:26.808
Bailyn: Yeah.
Student: How do you know

00:12:26.808 --> 00:12:28.429
what streaks belong to which
galaxies?

00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:29.866
Professor Charles
Bailyn: What streaks belong

00:12:29.866 --> 00:12:30.850
to which galaxies?
Okay.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:34.513
You know that the streaks must
come from galaxies that are

00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:38.177
located behind the galaxy
cluster, that are not themselves

00:12:38.177 --> 00:12:41.854
part of the galaxy cluster.
And, in order to understand

00:12:41.854 --> 00:12:43.912
what that streak is,
in principle,

00:12:43.912 --> 00:12:47.779
you'd need to know the exact
shape and size of that galaxy.

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:50.289
You can go and take a spectrum
of the thing and figure out how

00:12:50.289 --> 00:12:52.470
far away it is and what the
relative distances are.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.640
But, in principle,
you would need to know the

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.106
exact shape of that galaxy
before it was distorted,

00:12:57.106 --> 00:13:00.262
which you don't know.
And so, what you have to do,

00:13:00.262 --> 00:13:03.900
to interpret these things,
is to take many streaks and

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:07.470
assume that the galaxies that
caused them are kind of

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:11.039
normal--a normal distribution of
galaxy shapes.

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:14.100
And so, it's more of a
statistical process than using

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.159
them one at a time,
in that case.

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:18.556
The quasars are a little easier
to deal with,

00:13:18.556 --> 00:13:20.679
because you know that they're
points.

00:13:20.679 --> 00:13:23.857
And this--and there are various
kinds of limits to how much

00:13:23.857 --> 00:13:25.940
information you can get out of
this.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.771
And it's quite tricky to do.
What's easy to do is the thing

00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:32.742
that they did in that picture.
You imagine that there is a

00:13:32.742 --> 00:13:34.870
mass in the way,
and you figure out what happens

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:36.500
to the light from the
background.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.817
What's hard to do is to observe
the light in the background,

00:13:39.817 --> 00:13:42.235
not know what it ought to look
like, really,

00:13:42.235 --> 00:13:44.710
and infer what the mass
distribution is.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.017
That's a harder problem.
And there's a lot of

00:13:47.017 --> 00:13:48.894
theoretical effort,
at the moment,

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.509
going into trying to solve that
problem of,

00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:53.896
here's what you see,
infer what the mass

00:13:53.896 --> 00:13:57.200
distribution has to be in order
for you to see that.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.222
Yes?
Student: Have we ever

00:13:59.222 --> 00:14:01.086
observed where it was the
perfect lensing when you have a

00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:02.518
ring around [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:04.250
Bailyn: Yes,
there are some Einstein rings.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.937
I don't have them here.
Hubble Space Telescope has

00:14:06.937 --> 00:14:08.529
observed a bunch of these
things.

00:14:08.529 --> 00:14:11.328
Typically, they're not full
rings, because the mass

00:14:11.328 --> 00:14:13.679
distribution is not perfectly
symmetric.

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:15.018
But there are,
as you can see,

00:14:15.018 --> 00:14:16.356
you can see,
those were short,

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:18.840
kind of, little arcs.
And if you get it set up just

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.538
the right way,
the arcs can go a large

00:14:20.538 --> 00:14:22.420
fraction of the way around the
circle.

00:14:26.059 --> 00:14:29.552
So, these are,
kind of, fun things to observe,

00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:32.580
and also give you useful
information.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.470
So, that's the second of the
post-Newtonian effects.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.370
The first was the precession of
the perihelion.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:41.395
Now, the deflection of light.
Moving on, number three,

00:14:41.395 --> 00:14:45.698
here, is what we talked about
last time, which is the

00:14:45.698 --> 00:14:47.850
gravitational redshift.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.529
And here, we have delta lambda
over lambda [Δ λ/ λ],

00:14:58.529 --> 00:15:02.262
or alternatively,
in the case of the problem set

00:15:02.262 --> 00:15:05.636
you're working on,
the pulse period,

00:15:05.636 --> 00:15:10.325
in either case--these are
usually given the letter

00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:14.811
Z, that's redshift.
That's a definition of this

00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:17.409
quantity, Z,
which is often used.

00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:21.830
And this is equal to this
quantity.

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:38.010
And this is the Schwarzschild
radius of some mass.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:49.665
And this R is the
distance of the light source

00:15:49.665 --> 00:15:52.430
from that mass.

00:15:55.679 --> 00:16:03.922
And what this equation
signifies is how much redshift

00:16:03.922 --> 00:16:13.117
is there, if you observe this
thing when you are sitting at

00:16:13.117 --> 00:16:21.360
infinity--do you observe from
infinite distance.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.950
And what do I mean by infinite
distance?

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.134
What I mean is that
R_S / R

00:16:26.134 --> 00:16:29.676
goes to zero.
That's what infinite R

00:16:29.676 --> 00:16:33.008
means, in this case.
So, you're sitting out there a

00:16:33.008 --> 00:16:35.779
long, long, long way away from
any gravitational effect.

00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:38.662
You're looking at a light that
is emitted inside a

00:16:38.662 --> 00:16:41.779
gravitational field,
relatively close to some mass.

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:46.210
That light is redshifted by
this amount.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.656
And pulse periods are also
lengthened by the same amount,

00:16:49.656 --> 00:16:52.179
and I'll come back to that in a
minute.

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:56.049
One thing I want to say right
now is, what happens if you are

00:16:56.049 --> 00:16:59.210
an observer and you're not
infinitely far away?

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.074
What happens if you're just a
little bit further away than the

00:17:02.074 --> 00:17:04.722
light source is,
or perhaps even if you're

00:17:04.722 --> 00:17:08.109
closer to the object than the
light source is?

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:16.356
And, in that case,
if the observer is not at

00:17:16.356 --> 00:17:26.137
infinity, then the observed
redshift is equal to the

00:17:26.137 --> 00:17:34.000
redshift from the source to
infinity,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.639
which you could calculate by
this formula,

00:17:38.639 --> 00:17:44.410
minus the redshift from the
observer to infinity,

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.799
which you can also calculate
with that same formula.

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:51.599
So, you have to subtract two
things.

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:54.332
Basically, what happens is,
imagine the light going

00:17:54.332 --> 00:17:56.299
from--it starts out at the
source,

00:17:56.299 --> 00:17:59.014
it goes to the observer,
and then it keeps going all the

00:17:59.014 --> 00:18:01.254
way out to infinity.
And you want to ask,

00:18:01.254 --> 00:18:04.823
what does the observer see?
The observer sees that portion

00:18:04.823 --> 00:18:08.338
of the redshift that happens
between the source and the

00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:10.895
observer.
So, to figure out what that is,

00:18:10.895 --> 00:18:14.160
you figure out the redshift
from the source to infinity.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.510
You figure out the redshift
from the observer to infinity.

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.327
And you subtract those things.
And that gives you the redshift

00:18:21.327 --> 00:18:25.869
from the source to the observer.
Okay, yes?

00:18:25.869 --> 00:18:29.338
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:32.880
Bailyn: No,
no, no, but look what happens.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.551
When R_S / R
is equal to zero that means

00:18:36.551 --> 00:18:39.440
there is no redshift.
That means there is no redshift.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.720
It doesn't mean that the
observed wavelength is zero.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.880
It means the change in the
wavelength is zero.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.197
Yeah, that's important.
And, just to comment on the

00:18:51.197 --> 00:18:55.143
problem set here,
the idea on the second problem

00:18:55.143 --> 00:18:59.174
of the problem set is,
you do have an observer at

00:18:59.174 --> 00:19:01.760
infinity.
So, here's the observer.

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.950
Here's some neutron star.
And you have a light source

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:10.052
that can either be on the
surface of the neutron star,

00:19:10.052 --> 00:19:14.619
or it can be raised off the
surface of the neutron star.

00:19:14.619 --> 00:19:18.116
And basically,
what you're observing is the

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:22.795
change in the light source.
So, this has some redshift,

00:19:22.795 --> 00:19:27.326
some pretty large redshift,
because it's sitting on the

00:19:27.326 --> 00:19:32.527
surface of a neutron star.
This, because it's further away

00:19:32.527 --> 00:19:37.079
from the neutron star,
has slightly less redshift.

00:19:37.079 --> 00:19:43.609
And what you are interested in
is the change in the redshift.

00:19:43.609 --> 00:19:47.329
And the idea behind the problem
is, you want to set this up so

00:19:47.329 --> 00:19:51.232
that that change in the redshift
is the same as the change in the

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:53.549
redshift due to the Doppler
shift,

00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:56.819
if this whole thing was in
orbit around something.

00:19:56.819 --> 00:20:00.660
That's the plan of that
particular problem.

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:13.981
Okay, so that's the third of
the post-Newtonian relativistic

00:20:13.981 --> 00:20:18.069
effects, and there's a fourth
one.

00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:23.259
The fourth is gravitational
waves, which I may have time to

00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:26.569
come back and talk about in
detail.

00:20:26.569 --> 00:20:29.349
At the moment,
though, I just want to say what

00:20:29.349 --> 00:20:32.807
the effect of these things is,
rather than talk in detail

00:20:32.807 --> 00:20:36.914
about what they are.
The effect is that the orbital

00:20:36.914 --> 00:20:38.490
period decreases.

00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:48.566
Now, it turns out,
this is a relatively small

00:20:48.566 --> 00:20:54.609
effect, and it is not observed
in the Solar System,

00:20:54.609 --> 00:20:57.308
even in Mercury,
which has the strongest

00:20:57.308 --> 00:20:58.830
relativistic effect.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:07.584
Okay.
So, those are four

00:21:07.584 --> 00:21:11.759
post-Newtonian effects of
general relativity.

00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:16.783
And what I want to talk about
now is what has become probably

00:21:16.783 --> 00:21:21.890
the best laboratory for general
relativity that we know of.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.142
The problem with general
relativity is you can't actually

00:21:24.142 --> 00:21:25.589
study it all that much in the
lab,

00:21:25.589 --> 00:21:29.390
because, in order to study it,
you need strong gravitational

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.400
forces.
And it's very difficult to

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:34.260
create strong gravitational
forces in a laboratory.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.291
What would you need to do?
You'd need to take some massive

00:21:37.291 --> 00:21:39.779
object, crush it down to the
size of a black hole or

00:21:39.779 --> 00:21:42.119
something, and have it sit there
in your lab.

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:44.559
And this is not something that
one can do.

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:48.307
And so, you have to go and look
at astronomical objects in order

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:51.222
to find suitable situation in
which to study these

00:21:51.222 --> 00:21:56.222
relativistic effects.
So, the best lab for general

00:21:56.222 --> 00:22:02.869
relativity--lab for G.R.,
here, is a set of objects.

00:22:02.869 --> 00:22:06.292
And one object in particular,
which is referred to as the

00:22:06.292 --> 00:22:08.841
Binary Pulsar.
This is discussed in the

00:22:08.841 --> 00:22:11.329
readings for this week's problem
set.

00:22:11.329 --> 00:22:15.557
The discovery of this
particular object led to a Nobel

00:22:15.557 --> 00:22:20.024
Prize for its discoverers,
and that's what's discussed in

00:22:20.024 --> 00:22:23.557
that article.
So, the first thing to talk

00:22:23.557 --> 00:22:26.299
about, here, is what is a
pulsar?

00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:39.599
So, pulsars were discovered in
the late 1960s by a woman named

00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:44.976
Jocelyn Bell.
And she wired up a whole field

00:22:44.976 --> 00:22:48.065
in Cambridge,
England, to make it behave like

00:22:48.065 --> 00:22:52.045
a radio telescope,
and discovered that there were

00:22:52.045 --> 00:22:55.136
objects in the sky,
celestial objects,

00:22:55.136 --> 00:22:59.480
that seemed to be emitting
pulses of radio waves.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:05.404
So, the observed signature of
these things--what was observed

00:23:05.404 --> 00:23:09.554
is pulses of radio waves.
So, you get kind of a blip

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:11.431
every few seconds.
It goes blip,

00:23:11.431 --> 00:23:13.380
blip, blip, blip,
and so forth.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:21.509
And these pulses come by--so,
the pulsations happen

00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:29.964
once--it's sort of with a period
of somewhere between

00:23:29.964 --> 00:23:36.589
milliseconds and ten seconds.
So, they come at you pretty

00:23:36.589 --> 00:23:37.010
rapidly.

00:23:41.819 --> 00:23:44.819
Most of them are a few seconds
or maybe a fraction of a second.

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:48.069
So, these things are blipping
away.

00:23:48.069 --> 00:23:50.230
And they had no idea what these
were.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.400
And the first four of them they
gave the nickname LGM1,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.041
LGM2,
LGM3,

00:23:56.041 --> 00:23:58.981
LGM4,
for "little green men," because

00:23:58.981 --> 00:24:03.220
the thought was that these might
actually--they thought,

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.236
briefly, that these might be
signals from some

00:24:05.236 --> 00:24:07.577
extraterrestrial intelligence,
because, you know,

00:24:07.577 --> 00:24:10.670
it's a very regular signal.
It's hard to imagine how those

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.890
could have been created.
But, fortunately,

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.496
before they published their
paper, somebody suggested a

00:24:15.496 --> 00:24:17.910
better solution,
which turns out to be correct.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:26.478
That what these things are,
are rotating magnetized neutron

00:24:26.478 --> 00:24:29.329
stars.
And this was the first direct

00:24:29.329 --> 00:24:31.460
evidence that neutron stars
existed.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:35.219
And the reason they thought
they were neutron stars is

00:24:35.219 --> 00:24:39.404
because the speed with which
these things pulsed is supposed

00:24:39.404 --> 00:24:43.589
to be reflected in the rotation
of these neutron stars.

00:24:43.589 --> 00:24:46.958
And something that rotates ten
times a second had better be

00:24:46.958 --> 00:24:49.839
pretty small.
And so, there was strong size

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:53.544
limits on the neutron stars.
It's not going to matter,

00:24:53.544 --> 00:24:57.341
too much, exactly what these
things are, but I'm going to

00:24:57.341 --> 00:25:00.210
explain it to you anyway.
But don't worry too much about

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.187
it.
For the purposes of relativity,

00:25:02.187 --> 00:25:04.868
the key point,
here, is that it's an extremely

00:25:04.868 --> 00:25:08.264
accurate clock--that you get
these blips coming out of the

00:25:08.264 --> 00:25:10.813
thing,
and that creates a very

00:25:10.813 --> 00:25:14.047
accurate clock.
And then, you can see very

00:25:14.047 --> 00:25:17.660
small changes in the pulse rate
of these things.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.329
So, now let me just briefly
tell you what these are.

00:25:20.329 --> 00:25:24.121
Oh, I should mention--so,
the discovery of neutron stars,

00:25:24.121 --> 00:25:27.355
this was a very big deal.
This was the first strongly

00:25:27.355 --> 00:25:30.323
relativistic object that had
ever been discovered and they

00:25:30.323 --> 00:25:33.500
awarded a Nobel Prize to Jocelyn
Bell's thesis supervisor.

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:37.924
And there is some feeling among
some folks that this was an

00:25:37.924 --> 00:25:41.212
injustice.
And so, there is--people

00:25:41.212 --> 00:25:46.452
discuss the story of Jocelyn
Bell and the discovery of

00:25:46.452 --> 00:25:48.953
pulsars.
To her credit,

00:25:48.953 --> 00:25:52.915
Bell has never complained.
Bell and the discovery of

00:25:52.915 --> 00:25:55.930
pulsar-- Student: Did the
thesis advisor do anything?

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:56.877
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh yes,

00:25:56.877 --> 00:25:58.019
well that's actually an
interesting question.

00:25:58.019 --> 00:26:00.065
The question is,
"Did the thesis advisor do

00:26:00.065 --> 00:26:02.759
anything?"
As a thesis advisor myself,

00:26:02.759 --> 00:26:07.016
I take that question seriously.
Well, this is the whole debate

00:26:07.016 --> 00:26:09.710
about who should have gotten the
Nobel Prize.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:14.084
The thesis supervisor thought
up the experiment,

00:26:14.084 --> 00:26:18.096
and Bell did it.
So, who ought to get the credit

00:26:18.096 --> 00:26:20.640
for that?
It's actually a subtle

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.733
question, and it bears on
problem four,

00:26:23.733 --> 00:26:27.152
or whatever it is,
of this week's homework,

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:32.126
so it's worth thinking about.
Jocelyn Bell and the discovery

00:26:32.126 --> 00:26:34.700
of pulsars--he also got the
money.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.688
That's not trivial sometimes.
And the moral of the story--it

00:26:38.688 --> 00:26:41.962
depends on who you ask,
for exactly the reason that you

00:26:41.962 --> 00:26:45.801
bring up.
One moral of the story is that

00:26:45.801 --> 00:26:49.743
grad students,
particularly female grad

00:26:49.743 --> 00:26:55.344
students, never get any credit
and that this is a great

00:26:55.344 --> 00:26:58.184
injustice.
As you get older,

00:26:58.184 --> 00:27:01.509
your attitude towards this
problem changes.

00:27:01.509 --> 00:27:09.308
And the alternative moral is
that thinking and doing are not

00:27:09.308 --> 00:27:16.049
the same, and that thinking is
better than doing.

00:27:16.049 --> 00:27:19.758
Now, one could raise various
objections, and people have,

00:27:19.758 --> 00:27:22.734
to this line of thought.
And interestingly enough,

00:27:22.734 --> 00:27:25.746
the next time they had to give
a Nobel Prize for something to

00:27:25.746 --> 00:27:28.633
do with pulsars,
which was the discovery of the

00:27:28.633 --> 00:27:31.533
Binary Pulsar,
they did give the prize also to

00:27:31.533 --> 00:27:35.045
the graduate student.
And it's the graduate student's

00:27:35.045 --> 00:27:39.039
description of what he did that
you're actually reading for this

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:43.289
problem set.
So, you can opine on this topic

00:27:43.289 --> 00:27:49.839
yourselves on the problem set.
Anyway, a matter of continuing

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:53.630
controversy in scientific
circles.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.421
But let me just briefly show
you what's supposed to be

00:27:56.421 --> 00:27:59.806
happening, here.
Here is a neutron star--very

00:27:59.806 --> 00:28:02.938
dense thing, yeah?
And it's rotating,

00:28:02.938 --> 00:28:07.210
so, it's got some axis of
rotation, here--a different

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:09.890
color.
So, here's its axis of rotation.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.539
And it's rotating around its
axis.

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:13.910
And it's also got a magnetic
field.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.492
But the magnetic field,
the pole of the magnetic field,

00:28:17.492 --> 00:28:20.079
is not the same as the rotation
pole.

00:28:20.079 --> 00:28:21.539
That's true on the Earth as
well.

00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:25.287
Magnetic north is not exactly
in the same place as true North,

00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:27.559
the center of the Earth's
rotation.

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:31.395
And if you're in northern
Canada and you try and follow a

00:28:31.395 --> 00:28:34.751
compass signal north,
you're going to get yourself

00:28:34.751 --> 00:28:37.210
into big trouble.
Because, you know,

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.500
the actual magnetic pole is
somewhere in northern Canada,

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.683
and if you're north of that,
you'll be going south when you

00:28:42.683 --> 00:28:45.771
think you're going north.
Anyway, imagine that here's the

00:28:45.771 --> 00:28:49.065
magnetic field.
Magnetic fields have these sort

00:28:49.065 --> 00:28:51.650
of field lines that look like
this.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:55.578
And what happens in these
things is that there's radio

00:28:55.578 --> 00:28:58.839
emission coming out of the
magnetic poles.

00:28:58.839 --> 00:29:03.869
So, there's radio emission
coming out this way.

00:29:03.869 --> 00:29:08.279
And so, if you're observing
this from here,

00:29:08.279 --> 00:29:13.740
say, you see radio emission
when the pole is pointing

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:17.434
towards you.
But then, if the thing is

00:29:17.434 --> 00:29:21.220
rotating, then half a rotation
later--so, later,

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.168
but not too much later,
because this thing rotates

00:29:25.168 --> 00:29:29.003
really quickly.
Here's the neutron star,

00:29:29.003 --> 00:29:34.190
still, and now the pole's over
here, because it's rotated

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:38.730
around by a factor of two,
by half a rotation.

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.450
So, now the radio emission's
coming this way.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:44.112
And if you're still sitting
observing the thing down here,

00:29:44.112 --> 00:29:49.690
you don't see anything.
So this is on, and this is off.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.239
So, you watch this pole.
It's sort of like a lighthouse,

00:29:52.239 --> 00:29:54.032
you know.
A lighthouse has a beam of

00:29:54.032 --> 00:29:55.778
light.
And when it's pointing towards

00:29:55.778 --> 00:29:58.011
you, you see light.
And then, as it's going around

00:29:58.011 --> 00:29:59.509
in a circle, you don't see
light.

00:29:59.509 --> 00:30:01.480
Then it points towards you--you
see light again.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:05.839
And so, the consequence of this
is that you get something that

00:30:05.839 --> 00:30:09.269
looks--if you plot radio
emission versus time,

00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:14.690
you get these very regularly
spaced blips.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:19.496
And it is the time between one
blip and the next that's the

00:30:19.496 --> 00:30:20.740
pulse period.

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.459
And so, for our purposes
here--I mean,

00:30:27.459 --> 00:30:30.376
pulsars are very interesting
objects, but we're not going to

00:30:30.376 --> 00:30:33.691
go into them in any depth.
As objects, the key thing is

00:30:33.691 --> 00:30:36.829
that it's got this really
accurate clock on it.

00:30:36.829 --> 00:30:40.342
And if you imagine a pulsar in
orbit around something,

00:30:40.342 --> 00:30:44.120
when it comes towards you,
each one of these blips happens

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.868
a little closer to you.
So, the light travel time from

00:30:47.868 --> 00:30:51.093
the blip to you is less.
And so, it seems like the blips

00:30:51.093 --> 00:30:53.715
happen closer together,
because each one of them has

00:30:53.715 --> 00:30:55.720
emitted a little closer towards
you.

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.066
Similarly, when it's going
away, each blip is emitted a

00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:02.284
little further away.
It takes extra time to get to

00:31:02.284 --> 00:31:05.864
you, and the pulse period,
the length of time between the

00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:09.099
pulses, appears to be longer.
By how much?

00:31:09.099 --> 00:31:13.574
By exactly the amount that the
Doppler shift formula would

00:31:13.574 --> 00:31:17.210
suggest.
And so, the pulse period obeys

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:22.910
the same rules in terms of its
length as wavelengths of light

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:27.920
do.
Okay.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.615
So, for example,
it is true that Δ pulse period

00:31:33.615 --> 00:31:41.370
over pulse period is equal to
the usual Doppler shift formula,

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:53.356
which is approximately equal to
V_R / c,

00:31:53.356 --> 00:31:57.365
in the Newtonian approximation.
Oh, and I should say,

00:31:57.365 --> 00:31:59.628
in problem one on the problem
set, you can use the Newtonian

00:31:59.628 --> 00:32:02.037
approximation,
because, as you'll discover,

00:32:02.037 --> 00:32:05.742
the velocity of the object as
it goes around in its orbit is

00:32:05.742 --> 00:32:08.630
significantly less than the
speed of light.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:15.154
Okay.
So, they discover this Binary

00:32:15.154 --> 00:32:21.019
Pulsar with a short orbital
period.

00:32:21.019 --> 00:32:24.984
The orbital period--this is now
the orbital period--is around

00:32:24.984 --> 00:32:28.816
eight hours, which is pretty
short, but it's still not very

00:32:28.816 --> 00:32:31.783
relativistic.
But you can measure these

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:34.070
things to incredible accuracy.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:45.582
So, you cannot only see the
velocity curve that we're used

00:32:45.582 --> 00:32:47.947
to.
You can also see tiny

00:32:47.947 --> 00:32:52.279
deviations from the Newtonian
velocity curve.

00:32:52.279 --> 00:32:55.843
And from those tiny deviations
from the Newtonian velocity

00:32:55.843 --> 00:32:58.970
curve, you can see these
post-Newtonian effects.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:04.108
In particular,
it turns out--so this in an

00:33:04.108 --> 00:33:08.030
elliptical orbit.
It's not a circular orbit.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.710
It's a highly elliptical orbit.
And you can see the precession

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:18.366
of the periastron as the
ellipticity--as the direction of

00:33:18.366 --> 00:33:21.223
the orbit,
as the position of the orbit,

00:33:21.223 --> 00:33:24.150
changes, you can see the
precession of the periastron.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.127
And the precession of the
periastron happens at the rate

00:33:28.127 --> 00:33:32.942
of four degrees per year.
Now, compare that to Mercury,

00:33:32.942 --> 00:33:38.964
in which the same effect can be
observed at 43 arc seconds per

00:33:38.964 --> 00:33:42.557
century.
So, this is a much stronger

00:33:42.557 --> 00:33:43.300
effect.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:53.059
Okay.
You can also see the

00:33:53.059 --> 00:33:55.700
gravitational redshift.

00:34:03.609 --> 00:34:05.540
Now, let me show you how this
comes about.

00:34:08.559 --> 00:34:10.846
But you have to be careful
about exactly what you're

00:34:10.846 --> 00:34:12.674
seeing.
You're not seeing the

00:34:12.674 --> 00:34:16.269
gravitational redshift,
due to the fact that the clock

00:34:16.269 --> 00:34:20.320
is sitting on a neutron star.
Because, okay,

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:28.515
you're seeing the effect of the
companion object of this other

00:34:28.515 --> 00:34:33.470
object in the system,
which happens to be also a

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:35.600
neutron star,
but not a pulsar.

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:42.906
And what happens is this.
Here's your clock,

00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:47.220
and it's going around in some
kind of elliptical orbit.

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.739
Here's the center of mass.
Here's the other;

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:54.019
so, there's a clock that's
going around like this.

00:34:54.019 --> 00:34:59.446
And then, there's some other
object that's going around like

00:34:59.446 --> 00:35:01.173
this.
They're approximately the same

00:35:01.173 --> 00:35:01.390
mass.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:07.670
And so, sometimes these objects
are close to each other.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:12.745
For example,
here--when they're here and

00:35:12.745 --> 00:35:17.690
here, this is--call this
position 1.

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.760
And then, later on,
half an orbit later,

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:25.640
they're out here in position 2,
and this one's gone all the way

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.889
out to here.
So, at position 1,

00:35:29.889 --> 00:35:38.692
the objects are close,
and so, the clock is redshifted

00:35:38.692 --> 00:35:45.170
by the presence of the other
object.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:49.396
And so, it has to--there's a
redshift due to the other

00:35:49.396 --> 00:35:55.054
object, which is nearby.
Objects are close,

00:35:55.054 --> 00:36:05.809
so, the redshift caused by the
other object is large.

00:36:05.809 --> 00:36:13.078
At position 2 the distance to
the other object is much

00:36:13.078 --> 00:36:19.980
greater--distance is greater.
And so, redshift is less.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.446
Now, it's also true that
there's a redshift caused by the

00:36:27.446 --> 00:36:30.389
fact that this clock is sitting
on neutron star.

00:36:30.389 --> 00:36:32.719
But the thing about that
redshift is it doesn't change

00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:35.986
during the course of the orbit.
So, you can't actually tell

00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:38.737
that it's there.
Because that's one of the

00:36:38.737 --> 00:36:42.403
differences between measuring
pulse periods of pulsars and

00:36:42.403 --> 00:36:46.359
measuring wavelengths of light.
With these spectral features in

00:36:46.359 --> 00:36:49.270
light, you know what it's
supposed to be if it isn't

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:51.583
redshifted.
In the case of the pulsars you

00:36:51.583 --> 00:36:54.257
don't know, in advance,
what the pulse period ought to

00:36:54.257 --> 00:36:56.254
be.
So, you can't tell what it

00:36:56.254 --> 00:36:59.772
should be if there was no
gravitational field or was no

00:36:59.772 --> 00:37:02.557
Doppler shift.
All that you can tell is the

00:37:02.557 --> 00:37:05.971
amount by which it changes
during the course of an orbital

00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:08.475
period.
And so, you're comparing the

00:37:08.475 --> 00:37:12.831
redshift when the objects are in
this position to the redshift of

00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:16.839
the objects in this position.
The redshift caused by the

00:37:16.839 --> 00:37:20.710
pulsar itself doesn't change,
but the redshift caused by

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.992
where its companion is,
and the gravitational force

00:37:23.992 --> 00:37:26.090
exerted by the companion,
does change.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.507
The consequence,
by the way, is that if these

00:37:28.507 --> 00:37:31.726
things are in a circular orbit,
you can't see the gravitational

00:37:31.726 --> 00:37:34.631
redshift, because they're always
the same distance away from each

00:37:34.631 --> 00:37:36.618
other,
and the gravitational redshift

00:37:36.618 --> 00:37:38.784
doesn't change.
There is a gravitational

00:37:38.784 --> 00:37:42.261
redshift, but it doesn't change
during the course of the period,

00:37:42.261 --> 00:37:44.690
and it's the change that you
can observe.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.500
Yes?
Student: So,

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.717
in this case,
redshift refers not to the

00:37:48.717 --> 00:37:51.389
frequency of,
like, the light in the pulses?

00:37:51.389 --> 00:37:53.373
It refers to the [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:37:53.373 --> 00:37:55.150
Bailyn: It's the time
between pulses.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.991
Yeah.
You could imagine that the

00:37:57.991 --> 00:38:01.027
pulses might have a spectral
feature and then you would see

00:38:01.027 --> 00:38:02.860
it in the spectral feature,
too.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.060
In fact, that's extremely hard
to have that.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.159
That doesn't happen.
It's a continuum of light.

00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:12.938
So it's the time--what you
observe is the time between

00:38:12.938 --> 00:38:14.915
pulses.
And that can be observed

00:38:14.915 --> 00:38:17.709
extremely accurately.
You get 20 decimal places of

00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:21.070
accuracy.
It's really kind of frightening.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.861
Yes?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:38:24.861 --> 00:38:28.153
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:38:28.153 --> 00:38:31.000
if it's a circular orbit,
no.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.014
If there's a circular orbit,
they're always the same

00:38:33.014 --> 00:38:35.273
distance around each other.
They're chasing each other

00:38:35.273 --> 00:38:37.484
around in a circle.
That's what it means to be

00:38:37.484 --> 00:38:39.830
circular orbit,
if every point on the orbit is

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.539
the same distance to the center
for both objects.

00:38:42.539 --> 00:38:46.566
So, each object is the same
distance from the center of mass

00:38:46.566 --> 00:38:48.976
at all times.
That's what makes it a circular

00:38:48.976 --> 00:38:50.466
orbit.
And they're always on the

00:38:50.466 --> 00:38:53.290
opposite side of the center of
mass, so, the distance between

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.550
them is always the same for a
circular orbit.

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.289
I'll draw it.
Here we go.

00:38:58.289 --> 00:39:02.060
Here's the center of mass,
supposing these objects are the

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.735
same mass as each other.
Here's one of them,

00:39:04.735 --> 00:39:07.400
it's going around this way and
here it is right now.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.578
And here's the other object,
it's going around this way,

00:39:11.578 --> 00:39:15.245
and here it is right now.
And they're just going to march

00:39:15.245 --> 00:39:17.852
around this circle,
each being on the opposite side

00:39:17.852 --> 00:39:20.980
of the center and the distance
between them won't change.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.211
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:39:24.211 --> 00:39:27.167
Bailyn: Oh,
they only overlap if the two

00:39:27.167 --> 00:39:31.530
objects are the same mass.
So, if one object is more

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:36.499
massive than the other,
then you've got a little circle

00:39:36.499 --> 00:39:41.099
going this way and a big circle
going this way.

00:39:41.099 --> 00:39:43.219
Let's see, it would have to be
there.

00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:46.061
And then, they're still the
same distance from each other at

00:39:46.061 --> 00:39:48.971
every point along the way.
Because each one of them is

00:39:48.971 --> 00:39:51.748
always the same distance from
the center of mass,

00:39:51.748 --> 00:39:54.293
in the middle,
and they're always on opposite

00:39:54.293 --> 00:39:57.180
sides.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:00.098
Professor Charles
Bailyn: So,

00:40:00.098 --> 00:40:04.349
the way ellipses work is--so,
here's an ellipse.

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:08.000
And the ellipse can be big or
little--here's an ellipse.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.857
They're doing ellipses,
and the center of mass is at

00:40:11.857 --> 00:40:15.388
one focus of the ellipse.
It's not at the center of the

00:40:15.388 --> 00:40:17.309
ellipse.
That's the key thing.

00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:20.058
And so, when you're furthest
away from the focus,

00:40:20.058 --> 00:40:22.519
you have a long distance from
the center.

00:40:22.519 --> 00:40:24.800
When you're closer,
you're closer.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.495
And it's because,
each one of these things,

00:40:26.495 --> 00:40:28.756
you don't maintain a constant
distance from the center of

00:40:28.756 --> 00:40:29.120
mass.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.241
Okay, so, because of this
effect in elliptical orbits,

00:40:38.241 --> 00:40:41.392
in Binary Pulsars,
in elliptical orbits,

00:40:41.392 --> 00:40:45.190
you can observe the
gravitational redshift.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:49.185
Also – and this is what they
got the Nobel Prize for,

00:40:49.185 --> 00:40:53.550
really – you can see that the
orbital period decreases.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.037
It's getting shorter.
The two objects are spiraling

00:40:56.037 --> 00:40:56.660
in together.

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:04.710
Decreases due to gravitational
waves.

00:41:07.909 --> 00:41:12.822
So, you can observe three
different post-Newtonian effects

00:41:12.822 --> 00:41:18.056
in these systems.
So, this constitutes a serious

00:41:18.056 --> 00:41:23.929
test of general relativity in
the following way.

00:41:23.929 --> 00:41:30.648
If you could do only Newtonian
measurements,

00:41:30.648 --> 00:41:35.352
what would you get?
Well, we did this before,

00:41:35.352 --> 00:41:37.412
for the planets.
What you can get out of a

00:41:37.412 --> 00:41:39.291
Newtonian measurement of
velocity--remember,

00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:41.869
what you're doing is you're
measuring the Doppler shift;

00:41:41.869 --> 00:41:43.440
you're measuring radial
velocity.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.873
What you get is,
you can determine

00:41:46.873 --> 00:41:52.490
M_total,
the total mass of the system,

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:57.016
if you know the inclination.
That's something we tended to

00:41:57.016 --> 00:41:58.535
leave out.
We always claim these things

00:41:58.535 --> 00:42:00.590
are edge-on because it makes the
calculations easier.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:02.530
But, in fact,
you get a different answer

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:04.322
depending on what the
inclination is,

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:06.860
and you don't necessarily know
the inclination.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:13.146
So, if you now measure the
precession of the periastron,

00:42:13.146 --> 00:42:18.748
then this also--the amount of
that also depends on

00:42:18.748 --> 00:42:23.549
M_1,
M_2,

00:42:23.549 --> 00:42:28.349
the two masses,
and the inclination.

00:42:28.349 --> 00:42:31.789
So, you can solve for the
inclination now.

00:42:31.789 --> 00:42:34.764
This isn't actually precisely
how you do it,

00:42:34.764 --> 00:42:37.599
but conceptually,
this is how it works.

00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:39.889
You now solve for the
inclination.

00:42:39.889 --> 00:42:44.824
You then know
M_total,

00:42:44.824 --> 00:42:50.665
but not each individual mass.
Student: [Inaudible]

00:42:50.665 --> 00:42:52.750
Professor Charles
Bailyn:

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.046
M_1,
M_2 and the

00:42:56.046 --> 00:42:58.400
inclination, this is i.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.829
But you don't know the
individual masses.

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:08.009
Now, if both objects were
pulsars and you could see both

00:43:08.009 --> 00:43:12.340
orbits, then you would also know
the individual masses.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.992
But you don't.
You only see one of these

00:43:14.992 --> 00:43:16.570
objects.
Okay.

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:21.550
So, now, the next effect is
gravitational redshift.

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.676
And this, again,
depends, in a different way,

00:43:29.676 --> 00:43:33.343
on M_1,
M_2,

00:43:33.343 --> 00:43:39.320
and the inclination.
And so, now you can solve for

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:44.431
M_1.
And since you know the total

00:43:44.431 --> 00:43:47.449
mass, you also get
M_2.

00:43:47.449 --> 00:43:50.693
So, at this point you know
M_1,

00:43:50.693 --> 00:43:53.659
M_2 and the
inclination.

00:43:53.659 --> 00:43:56.633
What's happening here is that
each time you measure an effect,

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:58.340
you get an additional
constraint.

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:03.639
And you started out having
three unknowns and one equation.

00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:05.850
And, of course,
you can't solve for three

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:10.391
unknowns with only one equation.
But then, you observe two more

00:44:10.391 --> 00:44:12.426
effects.
So, now, you have three

00:44:12.426 --> 00:44:15.993
unknowns and three equations.
So, now, you can solve for all

00:44:15.993 --> 00:44:19.289
of these things.
Now you know everything.

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:24.818
At this point you can predict
what the period change should

00:44:24.818 --> 00:44:28.060
be, because you know everything.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.889
Then you can measure that.
And so, you have a specific

00:44:35.889 --> 00:44:39.230
prediction created from general
relativity.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:43.922
You can measure this effect,
and the prediction turns out to

00:44:43.922 --> 00:44:47.660
be correct, to within the
measurement errors.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.232
And the measurement errors are
getting more precise all the

00:44:55.232 --> 00:44:58.373
time, because as time goes on
the amount of change in the

00:44:58.373 --> 00:45:00.440
period,
since they first observe it,

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:02.606
increases.
Because the period's changing

00:45:02.606 --> 00:45:05.798
more, it's slowing down and the
period's getting faster and

00:45:05.798 --> 00:45:07.889
faster, the objects are falling
in.

00:45:07.889 --> 00:45:12.019
And so, over time that change
mounts up.

00:45:12.019 --> 00:45:14.333
You can measure it better and
better and better as time goes

00:45:14.333 --> 00:45:16.637
on.
And so, the precision of this

00:45:16.637 --> 00:45:20.489
test of general relativity is
going up all the time.

00:45:20.489 --> 00:45:28.638
So, it is now clear that
general relativity is correct,

00:45:28.638 --> 00:45:33.920
to some number of decimal
places.

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:36.802
I'm going to put correct in
quotes, because it depends how

00:45:36.802 --> 00:45:40.695
accurately you can measure it,
but the accuracy is going up

00:45:40.695 --> 00:45:44.840
all the time--in the
post-Newtonian approximation.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:50.210
Remember, all these effects are
post-Newtonian only.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:54.154
Actually, they've now observed
a couple of post-post-Newtonian

00:45:54.154 --> 00:45:57.969
effects, which are the next term
in the series expansion.

00:45:57.969 --> 00:46:01.078
And those are also correct,
but they're not measured as

00:46:01.078 --> 00:46:04.912
precisely yet.
So, it's clear that general

00:46:04.912 --> 00:46:11.815
relativity is correct as long as
everything is still pretty close

00:46:11.815 --> 00:46:16.016
to the Newtonian thing.
You can actually still have

00:46:16.016 --> 00:46:21.664
orbits.
But you could imagine a theory

00:46:21.664 --> 00:46:31.610
which is like Newton in the
first term of the expansion,

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:43.604
like general relativity in the
second term, the post-Newtonian

00:46:43.604 --> 00:46:55.010
term, but different in very
strong gravitational fields.

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:57.210
So, you've got to get the first
term to work,

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:59.159
and it's got to come out like
Newton.

00:46:59.159 --> 00:47:00.619
You've got to get the second
term to work.

00:47:00.619 --> 00:47:02.940
It's got to come out like
general relativity.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:06.828
But then, you can imagine all
sorts of different functions

00:47:06.828 --> 00:47:09.215
that work with this,
work with this,

00:47:09.215 --> 00:47:12.489
and are different in the higher
order terms.

00:47:12.489 --> 00:47:15.804
And the higher order terms are
the things that give rise to all

00:47:15.804 --> 00:47:18.103
these exciting effects,
like event horizons,

00:47:18.103 --> 00:47:24.388
and things like that.
So, what would be nice--it

00:47:24.388 --> 00:47:36.570
would be good to have some way
of testing strong field effects.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:40.266
And by that,
I mean, situations in which the

00:47:40.266 --> 00:47:45.079
Schwarzschild radius over
r becomes close to 1.

00:47:45.079 --> 00:47:48.566
Because, in that case,
all the terms in this series

00:47:48.566 --> 00:47:51.962
expansion, contribute.
And, if you can get it--if the

00:47:51.962 --> 00:47:54.890
theory is right there,
then all the terms have to be

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:57.262
the same,
and you don't have this nagging

00:47:57.262 --> 00:48:00.410
doubt about whether you could
come up with some theory that

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.139
looks like Newton,
in the same way that general

00:48:03.139 --> 00:48:06.431
relativity looks like Newton,
but is different once you get

00:48:06.431 --> 00:48:08.986
higher order terms.
Looks like general relativity

00:48:08.986 --> 00:48:11.148
in the second term,
but turns out to be a totally

00:48:11.148 --> 00:48:13.099
different theory.
Needless to say,

00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:15.852
the theorists have come up
with, literally,

00:48:15.852 --> 00:48:18.409
an infinite number of such
theories.

00:48:18.409 --> 00:48:21.543
Because there's a whole
infinite family of things which

00:48:21.543 --> 00:48:23.052
satisfy this,
satisfy this,

00:48:23.052 --> 00:48:25.489
and look different at the upper
level.

00:48:25.489 --> 00:48:30.324
So, what we're going to talk
about next time is how one might

00:48:30.324 --> 00:48:33.789
go about testing strong field
relativity.

00:48:33.789 --> 00:48:37.265
This is a subject close to my
heart because it's what I do for

00:48:37.265 --> 00:48:40.000
a living, and we'll talk about
it on Thursday.

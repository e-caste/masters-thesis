00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.770
Prof: This is data from
Bolivia.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.833
It came out the end of last
year and it's from the year

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:08.360
2003.
 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.877
Demographic data is always
delayed because it takes a long

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:12.379
time to collect it,
and analyze it,

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.130
and so forth.
 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.530
This is a fairly standard thing
that's happening.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.038
This is various five year
bunches, they take these surveys

00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:25.940
every five years,
this is from a thing called The

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.012
Demographic and Health Surveys
which are done basically in

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:32.299
every developing country of the
world by their own statistical

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.000
service.
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.567
Every country has a fairly
decent census and statistical

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:39.940
service and they go and ask
either all the women,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.994
if it's a census year,
or a subset of the women if

00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:46.860
it's not a census year and they
ask all kinds of questions,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.370
some of which you will see.
 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.010
The first thing of course is
how many children do you have?

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.761
They used--when they started
these kind of surveys they used

00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:58.280
to ask men and they would get a
number, the husband.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.011
Then they'd ask the wife,
get a different number,

00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:04.481
and when they checked it turns
out the woman was right and the

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:05.620
man had no clue.
 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.665
Veena will tell you,
maybe some stories about it's

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:14.042
not even a simple question,
even to the woman how many

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:16.188
children have you had.
 

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:19.348
In a lot of ways,
men's data was unreliable and

00:01:19.348 --> 00:01:23.262
in the early days they really
were interested in getting a

00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:25.197
real ground--
they didn't know how many

00:01:25.197 --> 00:01:27.424
people there were in the world,
what the fertility rates were,

00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:28.799
how fast population was
growing,

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.970
so just to get the basic ideas,
women were asked.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.872
From that date on men have
somewhat been excluded from the

00:01:36.872 --> 00:01:39.209
data collection,
so a lot of what we know,

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.060
in fact almost all of what we
know is about women,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.480
but nowadays its changing.
 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.251
In the last number of year's
people realize it takes two to

00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:51.090
tango and men are starting to
come more into the picture.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.733
Anyway here by 19--so this is a
five-year age group and this is

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.319
the total fertility rate.
 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.025
In 1965 and 1970 and other
years they were having roughly

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:05.221
6.6 children,
then gradually every five-year

00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:10.639
increment it came down until the
most recent number is 3.8

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.780
children.
 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.870
Now keep that 3.8 number in
mind because we want to compare

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.819
that to some other things,
and you probably know a little

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.090
about Bolivia.
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.500
It's totally Catholic,
it's quite poor,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.610
it's mostly agricultural,
it's not very urbanized,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.949
education is at a fairly low
level,

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.979
and the status of women there
is not really wonderful.

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:38.269
With all those indicate--what
they call social indicators what

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.066
would you think about the
fertility desires of women in

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:42.910
Bolivia?
 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.889
High? Low?
 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:47.160
High.
 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.234
All of those are sort of
standard classical factors that

00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:53.419
would make you think that they
want a lot of children,

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.378
but when you look at the actual
data it's rather moderate.

00:02:57.378 --> 00:03:01.977
It's still very high by our
standards of one or two children

00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:05.175
but still--
and it's still important for

00:03:05.175 --> 00:03:09.549
the world because at 3.8 you
double the population almost

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.462
every--
not quite double it every

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.050
generation so this is quite
high,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.366
but it's nothing like a 6,7
child thing or in the past the

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:23.681
traditional number of 7 or 8,
or maybe 9 children per woman,

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:29.258
so it's a situation of moderate
fertility.

00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:32.834
Now what--the next kind of set
of questions is well this is the

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:36.120
number of children you're
having, how many do you want?

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.997
They asked--this is asked--it's
a very tricky kind of question

00:03:39.997 --> 00:03:43.622
as you'll probably hear so
there's a lot of different ways

00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:45.530
of spinning this question.
 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.449
The first is they ask you,
'did you want your last child?'

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:58.032
That has a whole complicated
set of answers and just look out

00:03:58.032 --> 00:04:03.710
here for the total numbers that
'did you want the child at the

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.128
time that you had it?'
 

00:04:06.128 --> 00:04:11.556
Well 38% of women said,
yes I wanted it when I had it,

00:04:11.556 --> 00:04:16.677
but not wanted at all,
somewhat larger 40% of women

00:04:16.677 --> 00:04:19.339
didn't want it at all.
 

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.495
That's a surprising split and
then in between there's another

00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:26.889
20% of women who gave a more
ambiguous answer,

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.596
'well I didn't really want the
child right then but I probably

00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:34.485
would have wanted a child in the
future,' and a lot of guess work

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:38.132
on the part of the respondent in
that about what their future

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:39.470
desires will be.
 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.990
As you know,
humans change their mind every

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.149
five minutes on important
topics,

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:49.505
but that's a very interesting
statistic that there's more

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:54.862
children unwanted than are
wanted and that's somewhere in

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:56.009
between.
 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:58.610
Now there's probably a lot of
bias in this data.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.194
This is not considered
wonderful data because you're

00:05:01.194 --> 00:05:04.336
asking a woman who's just had a
child, or fairly recently had a

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:06.110
child, did you want that child?
 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.680
What's the bias?
 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.389
You say yes.
 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:14.680
I mean it's very--you have to
really not like that child in

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.175
order to say,
'oh yeah I had him but I didn't

00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:17.970
want him.'
 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.019
It happens and you see that at
40% of women do say that,

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:27.853
but this data is probably
biased to put more kids in this

00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:31.740
category then what the woman
really feels,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.916
although again,
intentions are very changeable

00:05:35.916 --> 00:05:39.350
and attitudes toward other
people,

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.853
husbands, children,
one minute you love them and

00:05:41.853 --> 00:05:44.089
the next minute hate them and so
forth,

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:49.740
so that's problematic,
the data there.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.596
One way of getting around that
particular problem is to ask

00:05:53.596 --> 00:05:56.250
them,
'do you want another child in

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.540
the future' because that's more
volitional,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.802
that's not saying I did
something wrong or something

00:06:02.802 --> 00:06:06.129
that I didn't want and so here's
that set of data;

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.120
again all this from the
Demographic and Health Survey.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.185
Again it's sort of what you
would expect,

00:06:12.185 --> 00:06:15.024
this is women who don't want,
want to stop childbearing,

00:06:15.024 --> 00:06:16.730
don't want any more children.
 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:22.737
If they've had no children
already very few of them don't

00:06:22.737 --> 00:06:25.420
want any children 6.5%.
 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.189
If they've had one child
already 30% say one child is

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:31.220
enough, I'm ready to stop.
 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.812
If they had two children you're
up to 2/3 of the women now say

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.584
that's enough for me,
I want to stop and when you get

00:06:39.584 --> 00:06:42.120
to three you're almost at the
maximum,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:48.610
and then four and above you're
into the 91%-92%.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.750
You notice it's kind of
interesting that it rises and

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.279
then it stays flat,
so there's about 8% of women

00:06:55.279 --> 00:07:00.149
who no matter how many children
they have they always say 'no I

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:02.220
want more,
I don't want to stop.'

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.959
This is what we call very
traditional women,

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:11.458
that as many as God gives me,
here comes in one version or

00:07:11.458 --> 00:07:13.992
another,
but it's 8% it's a very small

00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:16.685
number,
women who don't seem to have an

00:07:16.685 --> 00:07:20.220
idea of some number at which
they want to stop,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.055
or some of them they've already
had whether they want to now

00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:24.509
stop.
 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:36.690
Now you can ask another kind of
question,

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.529
you say this is called an ideal
number of children,

00:07:40.529 --> 00:07:43.170
and you ask a question like,
if you could go back to the

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.139
beginning before you had any
children,

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:50.057
how many children would you
have wanted as your ideal

00:07:50.057 --> 00:07:50.910
number?
 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.767
You get these kinds of numbers
that women who have no children

00:07:55.767 --> 00:08:00.387
want to have two--who now have
no children asking what they

00:08:00.387 --> 00:08:04.569
think their ideal was;
they want 2.1 children.

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:09.755
Women who already have one
child 2.1, those that have two

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:15.221
say 2.4, and then the number
goes on up, including women who

00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:18.000
have six or more children.
 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.682
Now it's pretty clear that one
should really expect this kind

00:08:23.682 --> 00:08:28.202
of thing because the simplest,
most obvious reason is,

00:08:28.202 --> 00:08:31.170
women who want more children
have more children.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.861
As you have more children
that's a sign that you wanted

00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:34.658
more children.
 

00:08:34.658 --> 00:08:36.921
That certainly may be the
biggest factor,

00:08:36.921 --> 00:08:38.899
just a very simple kind of
thing.

00:08:38.899 --> 00:08:42.974
Another factor is women who
have had more children are

00:08:42.974 --> 00:08:43.590
older.
 

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:46.649
Remember we're talking about a
period in history,

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:49.658
I mean this is recent,
where ideas are changing,

00:08:49.658 --> 00:08:52.058
fertility is changing,
standards and norms and

00:08:52.058 --> 00:08:56.408
personal desires are changing,
so the older women just by the

00:08:56.408 --> 00:09:01.590
age factor will probably be of a
somewhat older generation.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.970
I won't go into it but this
looks at that,

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.399
here is the age of a woman and
again,

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.168
how many if you went back to
the beginning,

00:09:09.168 --> 00:09:13.150
how many children would you
have liked and you get just an

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.546
age factor,
but not wildly different from

00:09:15.546 --> 00:09:15.840
this.
 

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.794
Just generational change is a
bigger factor in that then you

00:09:21.794 --> 00:09:23.308
might expect.
 

00:09:23.308 --> 00:09:26.985
And also in this rise is what
we've just talked about that

00:09:26.985 --> 00:09:29.629
women already had a bunch of
children,

00:09:29.629 --> 00:09:33.423
when they reconstruct back what
they used to think or now think

00:09:33.423 --> 00:09:36.672
that they would think they--
again well I have three I'm

00:09:36.672 --> 00:09:39.129
either happy or whatever they
think about it,

00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:44.690
it's hard for them to say no I
don't want this many.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.740
Have you noticed anything funny
now?

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:53.466
Anything about the number,
these numbers and the number I

00:09:53.466 --> 00:09:55.820
told you to remember?
 

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.960
No class of woman wants more
than 3.3 children.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.812
Most of the women are in the
two range and only those that

00:10:02.812 --> 00:10:05.450
have six and more children want
3.3,

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.980
and the same if you look it out
by age,

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:10.990
no group of women wants more
than three.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.299
What did I say about how many
they're having?

00:10:13.299 --> 00:10:15.778
3.8.
 

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:19.702
This now accords with the other
stuff that you've seen that

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:23.965
women want--it looks like women
want fewer children than they're

00:10:23.965 --> 00:10:24.710
having.
 

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.910
Well this is Bolivia,
maybe there's something a

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.200
little bit special about
Bolivia,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.369
and you always have to check
and see whether you're getting

00:10:35.369 --> 00:10:38.428
some sort of outlier or is this
the general situation.

00:10:38.428 --> 00:10:44.710
You don't have to look at that
too closely yet.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.447
An economist at The World Bank,
a guy named Lant Pritchett,

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:52.506
did a paper and the first thing
he did was collect all that data

00:10:52.506 --> 00:10:53.990
from every country.
 

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.302
These Demographic and Health
Surveys are published every time

00:10:58.302 --> 00:11:02.399
a country does its own
statistical demographic survey,

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:04.690
and so all of this information
is available,

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.259
and now it's computerized and
so forth,

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:09.350
and there's uniformity.
 

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:14.091
There's a group called Macro
International that sort of helps

00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:18.833
these various countries design
these surveys so that they can

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:23.813
be compared internationally and
get fairly good comparability of

00:11:23.813 --> 00:11:25.000
the data.
 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.746
What he did is,
of these various statistical

00:11:27.746 --> 00:11:31.325
ways of finding out how many
children women want and they

00:11:31.325 --> 00:11:33.048
have different numbers.
 

00:11:33.048 --> 00:11:35.220
This is average ideal number of
children,

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.450
this is desired total fertility
rate,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.442
and here's a third one,
the wanted total fertility rate

00:11:43.442 --> 00:11:46.434
and they all correct for
different factors in different

00:11:46.434 --> 00:11:49.211
ways,
but the only thing I think that

00:11:49.211 --> 00:11:53.730
you have to sort of notice is
that they're all about the same.

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:59.307
No matter how you spin this you
get a picture that looks

00:11:59.307 --> 00:12:01.539
something like this.
 

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:03.090
What is it?
 

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.023
Wanted TFR, in this case is how
many children does the woman

00:12:07.023 --> 00:12:07.490
want?
 

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.716
Self report,
this is how many she says she

00:12:09.716 --> 00:12:12.432
wants, do you want 2,3,
4,5, 6,7, 8 and this is the

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:13.788
total fertility rate.
 

00:12:13.788 --> 00:12:17.028
How many children is she
actually having?

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:22.375
The countries are luckily all
named here, and you can see

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:26.956
Syria for instance,
the women want 5 children and

00:12:26.956 --> 00:12:28.578
they're having 7.
 

00:12:28.578 --> 00:12:30.870
something children.
 

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:37.702
Here is--pick another one,
Pakistan, they want 4 children

00:12:37.702 --> 00:12:41.120
they're having 6 children.
 

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.038
You can look at that and every
country is in there.

00:12:46.038 --> 00:12:51.240
One important thing is how
important the desire,

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.931
whatever children want,
that there's a very strong

00:12:53.931 --> 00:12:57.172
correlation between the number
of children that you want and

00:12:57.172 --> 00:12:59.700
the number of children you
actually have,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.940
aggregated by country.
 

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.761
I mean we're taking a lot of
people and lumping them into two

00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:05.813
numbers,
this number and this number,

00:13:05.813 --> 00:13:09.048
and there's great variation of
course within in each country

00:13:09.048 --> 00:13:11.460
but that's certainly an
important factor.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.761
The key line,
because Pritchett in gathering

00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:16.866
this data, wanted to make a
different point which we're not

00:13:16.866 --> 00:13:18.259
going to get to today.
 

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:22.690
He leaves out a really
important line here which is

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.879
this line that I've drawn this
in.

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.000
What line is that?
 

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.251
That's the line where it is if
you want two children you have

00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:32.868
two children,
if you want three children you

00:13:32.868 --> 00:13:35.923
have three children,
if you want nine children you

00:13:35.923 --> 00:13:39.190
have nine children,
so any country that was on that

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.639
line people are having the
number of children that they

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.149
want.
 

00:13:43.149 --> 00:13:46.009
What do you notice about all
these countries?

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:49.440
Every single one of them is
above the line,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.932
meaning that in every single
country they're having more

00:13:53.932 --> 00:13:56.220
children then they want.
 

00:13:56.220 --> 00:13:57.889
What they want is what they
have;

00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:00.889
they're all above that line of
equality.

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:04.323
This is some of the cleanest
social science data I have ever

00:14:04.323 --> 00:14:06.803
seen,
the way they're all one side of

00:14:06.803 --> 00:14:09.501
the line,
they follow very nicely the

00:14:09.501 --> 00:14:10.750
regression line.
 

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.017
This is the regression line
that he drew in which is just a

00:14:15.017 --> 00:14:18.769
line that is closest to all the
points together,

00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:26.783
a statistical way of making the
line as close as possible to all

00:14:26.783 --> 00:14:28.820
of the points.
 

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:34.427
This gap here between what
people want, if they got what

00:14:34.427 --> 00:14:40.442
they wanted and what they're
actually having is called unmet

00:14:40.442 --> 00:14:41.360
need.
 

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.259
A very complicated idea,
much argued about,

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:46.960
and Veena may or may not
discuss it,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.947
but what it tells you is that
there's a very noticeable

00:14:51.947 --> 00:14:55.509
difference between--
it's describing that difference

00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:58.620
between the number of children
people have and what they want.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:04.798
It's roughly one child per
family here.

00:15:04.798 --> 00:15:08.530
This number in principle should
be one and a half children,

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.811
but there's certain
connections, it's actually about

00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:15.423
one child per family;
the difference between what

00:15:15.423 --> 00:15:17.649
they have and what they want.
 

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:23.280
Now in the developing world
this is a little bit old data,

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:29.110
but in the developing world
today the average fertility rate

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.788
is about 3.5.
 

00:15:30.788 --> 00:15:34.456
In order to come to stable
population in the developing

00:15:34.456 --> 00:15:36.899
world it has to come down to
2.1,

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:39.519
but if all the women here in
these countries that are

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:43.186
reporting what they want,
if they actually had the number

00:15:43.186 --> 00:15:47.698
of children that they want you'd
subtract out from the 3.5 (one

00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:51.095
child),
you're down to 2.5 and you're

00:15:51.095 --> 00:15:56.284
actually very close then to
what's called replacement level

00:15:56.284 --> 00:15:59.058
fertility this 2.1 children.
 

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:04.852
This difference of what women
want and what they have is an

00:16:04.852 --> 00:16:07.649
extremely important issue.
 

00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:12.576
In one version of the kind of
thing that Planned Parenthood

00:16:12.576 --> 00:16:17.248
and other international and
domestic organizations do is

00:16:17.248 --> 00:16:21.580
help women get to the fertility
that they want.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.153
Not as pushing them into
something but giving them

00:16:26.153 --> 00:16:29.418
something that they already
want.

00:16:29.418 --> 00:16:32.523
This data, as in all data,
brings up a whole bunch of

00:16:32.523 --> 00:16:33.240
questions.
 

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.918
One: does this really reflect
people's data?

00:16:35.918 --> 00:16:38.807
Have we actually--have these
kinds of questions and this kind

00:16:38.807 --> 00:16:41.647
of statistical analysis really
tapped into the real emotions

00:16:41.647 --> 00:16:43.139
and feelings of the people?
 

00:16:43.139 --> 00:16:46.808
You always have to question
these kinds of survey data.

00:16:46.808 --> 00:16:52.370
You remember that you read this
in readings in Africa,

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.340
that when the women were asked
how many children do you want,

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.860
it was a meaningless question
to them.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.323
They said whatever Ala says,
whatever God says,

00:16:59.323 --> 00:17:02.538
they can't--it's just not in
their--what their technical term

00:17:02.538 --> 00:17:04.519
is 'calculus of rational
choice.'

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:10.030
Well there's women like that in
this survey and what number do

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:12.200
you put down for them?
 

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.683
These women,
as I've said is basically--is

00:17:14.683 --> 00:17:16.318
all collected from women.
 

00:17:16.318 --> 00:17:18.339
What about men,
do men want more children?

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:19.200
Do they want the same?
 

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.480
Do they want less?
 

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.618
Is it that women's desires
don't matter?

00:17:22.618 --> 00:17:27.130
It is men's desires that really
matter?

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:31.769
Why do women up here in Kenya
and Mali at this time want so

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:35.130
many children and have so many
children?

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:38.728
Whereas, countries you might
not think of wildly different

00:17:38.728 --> 00:17:42.452
Trinidad, Dominican Republic,
Fiji, various other places are

00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:43.588
way down here.
 

00:17:43.588 --> 00:17:50.519
Why some countries here and
some countries there?

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:54.496
Another thing is that in most
of the world people actually

00:17:54.496 --> 00:17:56.380
know about contraception.
 

00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:02.452
Here is data again from the
Bolivian survey 2003 and do they

00:18:02.452 --> 00:18:05.848
know a method of contraception?
 

00:18:05.848 --> 00:18:10.164
Well they know any method yeah,
95% of the women know about

00:18:10.164 --> 00:18:12.986
contraception,
and even the modern methods

00:18:12.986 --> 00:18:15.970
which are listed here,
92% of the women they know

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.970
about it and many of the women
know about more than one method,

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:23.619
so 80% know about the pill,
another 80% the IUD,

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:25.019
another 80% the injectables.
 

00:18:25.019 --> 00:18:27.200
That means there's a lot of
overlap between these.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.417
They don't know one method,
they know two,

00:18:29.417 --> 00:18:32.826
and three, and male condom they
know about, female sterilization

00:18:32.826 --> 00:18:34.450
they know about and so on.
 

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:39.173
This is lactational amenorrhea
which is the traditional method

00:18:39.173 --> 00:18:43.279
that we've talked about of
spacing births and half the

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:47.229
women know that if you
breastfeed you'll prolong the

00:18:47.229 --> 00:18:49.940
interval between your births.
 

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.565
Not only do they know about the
method but they've used the

00:18:53.565 --> 00:18:56.218
method,
77% of women have tried

00:18:56.218 --> 00:19:01.773
something, a fair amount of that
is 20% of these women are using

00:19:01.773 --> 00:19:07.328
only traditional methods which
include rhythm type methods,

00:19:07.328 --> 00:19:13.049
but still 57% have actually
used a modern method.

00:19:13.049 --> 00:19:17.210
Currently using drops down.
 

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.630
They've tried it and for some
reason they've stopped.

00:19:34.348 --> 00:19:39.047
One is this medical problem
that the dominant reason why

00:19:39.047 --> 00:19:42.890
women say they're not using
contraception--

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.509
so you've seen the data,
they want to stop childbearing,

00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:46.568
it's overwhelming.
 

00:19:46.568 --> 00:19:49.328
You saw like Bolivia--what was
the final number,

00:19:49.328 --> 00:19:59.098
I don't know I pointed it out,
70% I think it was--

00:19:59.098 --> 00:20:01.911
something like 70% of the women
say ‘I don't want any more

00:20:01.911 --> 00:20:04.308
children ever,
I want to just plain old stop,'

00:20:04.308 --> 00:20:07.218
and then if you add in those
that are not sure about the

00:20:07.218 --> 00:20:09.202
future,
but they say well at least not

00:20:09.202 --> 00:20:12.105
in the next two years and then
beyond two years I don't know so

00:20:12.105 --> 00:20:15.190
you add at least another 10%--
something like 80% of women

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:19.390
want some kind of protection,
they either want to mostly stop

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.838
totally or at least for the next
two years.

00:20:22.838 --> 00:20:25.824
You can even go down,
this is again older data from

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:28.450
Bolivia, that's one of my
favorite places;

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:32.308
I was--spent some good times
there.

00:20:32.308 --> 00:20:36.943
If you just take teenagers age
15 to 19 already about 40% of

00:20:36.943 --> 00:20:41.265
them say I've had all the
children I want the whole rest

00:20:41.265 --> 00:20:46.450
of my life and the average age
of that sample is 17 years old.

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:50.259
So you have these huge number
of women who don't want--

00:20:50.259 --> 00:20:53.657
want to stop childbearing and
yet if you look from the

00:20:53.657 --> 00:20:57.890
Demographic and Health Surveys
at the contraceptive prevalence,

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.744
like in Bolivia again,
at the time of Robey article

00:21:00.744 --> 00:21:03.828
that you have read last night or
are going to read,

00:21:03.828 --> 00:21:06.798
the women who want protection
either--

00:21:06.798 --> 00:21:10.425
are about--were about 80% and
the women that were using

00:21:10.425 --> 00:21:15.280
protection was like 12%,
and you ask them why and

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.349
largely, and especially more
recently,

00:21:20.349 --> 00:21:22.818
it's medical reasons.
 

00:21:22.818 --> 00:21:25.480
There is first of all a
campaign by conservative,

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.808
especially religious people in
places like Kenya to--

00:21:29.808 --> 00:21:33.384
they're opposed to the use of
contraception and they really

00:21:33.384 --> 00:21:36.843
blow up medical problems,
so the people are getting very

00:21:36.843 --> 00:21:38.230
poor information on it.
 

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.700
Now here's an example,
one of the undergraduates that

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.170
took this course a few years
back,

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.625
a very energetic young lady and
she got interested in this stuff

00:21:48.625 --> 00:21:53.009
and so I arranged for her to go
to Kenya to answer exactly this

00:21:53.009 --> 00:21:53.930
question.
 

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:57.828
Why is it that women--and
you'll hear a little later--

00:21:57.828 --> 00:22:01.700
why is it that women who say
they don't want any children,

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:05.207
they're living in Nairobi and
there's plenty of contraceptives

00:22:05.207 --> 00:22:08.828
available in Nairobi and you can
get them more or less free,

00:22:08.828 --> 00:22:12.930
or a small cost,
and they're not using it,

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.298
then they get pregnant.
 

00:22:15.298 --> 00:22:17.278
They can't have that baby,
they don't want the baby,

00:22:17.278 --> 00:22:20.248
so they go to some bush doctor,
and it's illegal in most of

00:22:20.248 --> 00:22:21.808
Africa,
Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:24.127
all of Africa,
abortion is illegal but here

00:22:24.127 --> 00:22:27.220
they got pregnant so they go to
some horrible clinic.

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.338
The death rate is very,
very high.

00:22:29.338 --> 00:22:32.900
Here's women who don't want
children,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.890
don't use contraception even
though it's available to them,

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:40.757
and yet when they get pregnant
they're willing to undergo an

00:22:40.757 --> 00:22:42.595
operation,
a very crude,

00:22:42.595 --> 00:22:46.765
illegal operation by an
untrained practitioner that will

00:22:46.765 --> 00:22:51.162
lead to a very high rate of
death and they're well aware of

00:22:51.162 --> 00:22:52.298
that fate.
 

00:22:52.298 --> 00:22:55.609
Everybody knows somebody who's
died from a botched abortion and

00:22:55.609 --> 00:22:57.960
you've read some of that in the
European--

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.920
in the era in America and
Europe when that was common.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.441
She went there and it turns out
that women are very much

00:23:06.441 --> 00:23:09.400
influenced by rumors,
what they hear,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.838
because their education is not
really their thing.

00:23:13.838 --> 00:23:15.888
This student,
this Yale undergraduate

00:23:15.888 --> 00:23:18.950
collected these rumors,
and one of the rumors,

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:23.190
one of the most extreme rumors
was well mostly in Africa,

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:26.589
and I think you read this--the
people that haven't been to

00:23:26.589 --> 00:23:30.109
university don't distinguish
between stomach and uterus,

00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:31.660
it's all one big cavity.
 

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.269
Was that in one of your
readings?

00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:36.440
I think it was,
anyway it doesn't matter;

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.420
it's all one thing there.
 

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.988
Now you take a pill,
and they know something about

00:23:40.988 --> 00:23:42.594
pills,
penicillin and everything,

00:23:42.594 --> 00:23:44.338
but every day for the rest of
my life,

00:23:44.338 --> 00:23:46.380
why do I have to keep taking
this pill?

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.430
Why don't I take a pill and
that settles the issue?

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.615
Well they figure I get pregnant
and the fetus starts to grow

00:23:54.615 --> 00:23:55.670
inside me.
 

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.460
Well what does the pill do?
 

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.385
The pill goes down and
dissolves, they have some idea

00:24:00.385 --> 00:24:03.705
that it's wet and dissolves,
and then reforms over the fetus

00:24:03.705 --> 00:24:05.170
and starts coating it.
 

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:07.828
But everyday they know the
fetus is getting bigger,

00:24:07.828 --> 00:24:11.430
so you need to take another
pill to add to the coat of it,

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:17.700
and at the end what you grow
and what you get is a mummy.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.403
You get a fetus that can be
fully grown and coated with a

00:24:22.403 --> 00:24:26.940
white stuff like an egg and
that's what you deliver.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.907
Well if you believe something
like that you're not going to go

00:24:29.907 --> 00:24:31.318
anywhere near pills,
right?

00:24:31.318 --> 00:24:36.244
Some of these similar kinds of
stories happen with everything

00:24:36.244 --> 00:24:36.818
else.
 

00:24:36.818 --> 00:24:40.500
This young lady herself got the
five little silastic implants in

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.480
her arm and she when she came
back she was very--

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.807
she got it in Kenya,
one because she wanted it and

00:24:45.807 --> 00:24:48.660
two she wanted to show the women
sees it's not dangerous,

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:52.858
I'm even doing it myself,
but that's irrelevant.

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:57.051
One thing is--any--no clue
about medical stuff,

00:24:57.051 --> 00:25:00.423
physiology, digestion,
anatomy inside,

00:25:00.423 --> 00:25:05.618
huge numbers of women don't
have any clue about this.

00:25:05.618 --> 00:25:10.858
This girl did a very clever
thing, she was a Yalie,

00:25:10.858 --> 00:25:14.499
and she then asked the
women--Kenyan women are not any

00:25:14.499 --> 00:25:17.569
stupider than anybody else,
they're smart women,

00:25:17.569 --> 00:25:19.538
they said do you believe such a
rumor?

00:25:19.538 --> 00:25:22.981
They were just reporting it as
a rumor and the women were of

00:25:22.981 --> 00:25:24.848
course very skeptical of this.
 

00:25:24.848 --> 00:25:28.015
Well I've heard this and that
is it true or not and they were

00:25:28.015 --> 00:25:29.440
properly skeptical of it.
 

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.940
She collected this whole range
of rumors,

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.434
and she found that--she asked,
which ones do you believe more

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:38.884
than others,
and she sort of could get a

00:25:38.884 --> 00:25:41.445
ranking on it,
and then she asked all kinds of

00:25:41.445 --> 00:25:44.538
questions and it turned out that
it was very simple,

00:25:44.538 --> 00:25:47.634
that they believed something
depending on how many times they

00:25:47.634 --> 00:25:48.410
had heard it.
 

00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:51.480
This particular rumor was not
one of the most prevalent,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.190
some other rumors were,
equally not true,

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:59.019
but if you hear it a lot then
you believe it because they

00:25:59.019 --> 00:26:03.502
don't have a sense of expertise,
scientific competency,

00:26:03.502 --> 00:26:05.298
any of that sort of stuff.
 

00:26:05.298 --> 00:26:08.730
A sociologist at Penn,
Susan Watkins,

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.664
who I may have mentioned before
and certainly will mention again

00:26:11.664 --> 00:26:13.528
who works in Kenya in the Luo
region,

00:26:13.528 --> 00:26:15.288
not in Nairobi,
a different region,

00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:19.890
she attended a lecture where a
local woman,

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:22.297
speaking the local dialect had
gone to Nairobi and gotten

00:26:22.297 --> 00:26:24.345
trained--
a nurse type--she wasn't

00:26:24.345 --> 00:26:27.712
trained--an official nurse--
but working in that kind of

00:26:27.712 --> 00:26:31.343
establishment,
went to Nairobi and got trained

00:26:31.343 --> 00:26:34.730
to be a reproductive health
educator.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.131
She comes back and is having
some sort of a white coat or

00:26:38.131 --> 00:26:40.574
uniform,
or a blouse or something and

00:26:40.574 --> 00:26:43.108
she gives a lecture to the women
with--

00:26:43.108 --> 00:26:45.670
they have these models of
pregnancy models,

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.567
models of internal anatomy
slides, very nice and she was

00:26:49.567 --> 00:26:51.913
good at it,
and the women were absolutely

00:26:51.913 --> 00:26:53.327
rapt,
they were listening to every

00:26:53.327 --> 00:26:53.558
word.
 

00:26:53.558 --> 00:26:56.728
But as they left the room they
started sort of staring each

00:26:56.728 --> 00:26:59.211
other,
what are we going to make out

00:26:59.211 --> 00:27:01.530
of this,
and outside there was a woman

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:04.800
scrubbing the floor,
a washer woman there and these

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.118
women just dove onto the washer
woman and said,

00:27:08.118 --> 00:27:10.430
is she telling--is what she's
telling is true,

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:12.967
is this good for us,
is she our kind of women that

00:27:12.967 --> 00:27:14.871
the--
and really asked the washer

00:27:14.871 --> 00:27:18.295
woman all kinds of questions
about this information which the

00:27:18.295 --> 00:27:20.750
washer woman had no technical
expertise.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:25.122
The idea being that they don't
have this sense of that

00:27:25.122 --> 00:27:29.000
knowledge comes from some sort
of expertise,

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.559
that more knowledge comes from
someone like me is a more

00:27:31.559 --> 00:27:34.073
important variable than that
you've been to Nairobi and

00:27:34.073 --> 00:27:35.608
gotten some kind of training.
 

00:27:35.608 --> 00:27:38.181
And the washer woman they
perceived was closer to them

00:27:38.181 --> 00:27:40.994
than the woman who has gotten
some education even though it

00:27:40.994 --> 00:27:44.096
was a local--
a person from that local

00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:45.140
community.
 

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.845
It's a very complicated issue
and the big battle is in getting

00:27:48.845 --> 00:27:52.490
people thinking about this and
trying to do some of that,

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:58.588
is sort of how much of this
difference and how much of the--

00:27:58.588 --> 00:28:01.164
people in general having
more--how much of it is that

00:28:01.164 --> 00:28:04.086
there's something wrong this
data that they really do want a

00:28:04.086 --> 00:28:05.970
lot of children and many of
them--

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:11.205
in many countries up there they
wanted 5,6, 7,8 children and how

00:28:11.205 --> 00:28:16.459
much of it is--
they don't have access--access

00:28:16.459 --> 00:28:21.450
doesn't mean just handing out
condoms.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.769
This is the last story and I'll
shut up.

00:28:25.769 --> 00:28:28.776
There's a famous story that
passes around family planning

00:28:28.776 --> 00:28:31.730
circles about someone going into
an African village,

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:36.930
and finding in front of each
hut a stick and the stick was an

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.490
unrolled condom.
 

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:41.680
That was very strange and so
they went and asked what this

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:41.960
is?
 

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.265
We had a family planning worker
and they showed us how to

00:28:45.265 --> 00:28:48.747
prevent pregnancy and they had
this stick and they showed us

00:28:48.747 --> 00:28:51.048
how to unroll it and they did
that.

00:28:51.048 --> 00:28:54.778
I have heard this kind of story
any number of times and I tossed

00:28:54.778 --> 00:28:57.102
it off--
it's something like--I had a

00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:59.163
little--
the--more doubts,

00:28:59.163 --> 00:29:01.730
I just tossed the story off.
 

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:04.480
Then I'm in Kline Tower and I
came out one night,

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:07.050
I work late,
and the Forestry was having a

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:10.813
party and some of the graduate
students were out back smoking

00:29:10.813 --> 00:29:13.673
or chatting,
so I chatted them up and one of

00:29:13.673 --> 00:29:17.028
them had been in a part of South
Africa called Transkei,

00:29:17.028 --> 00:29:21.134
and she told me she went into
this village and what did she

00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:21.558
see?
 

00:29:21.558 --> 00:29:24.726
It was cucumbers and all the
people had cucumbers with

00:29:24.726 --> 00:29:27.602
condoms unrolled on them,
so this is a student who's here

00:29:27.602 --> 00:29:29.618
at Yale right now that saw this
with her own eyes,

00:29:29.618 --> 00:29:33.018
so this is another one of these
amazing stories that's true and

00:29:33.018 --> 00:29:36.361
gives you sort of at least an
anecdotal hint into what's going

00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:40.420
on--
scratching beneath this data.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.450
Okay see you next week.

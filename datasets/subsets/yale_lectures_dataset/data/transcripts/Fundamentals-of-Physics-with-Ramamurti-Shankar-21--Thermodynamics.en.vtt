00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.254
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Alright class,

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:07.120
welcome back.
This is our last two weeks.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.582
We're going to have a slightly
different schedule for the

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:14.419
problem sets.
I'm going to assign something

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.930
today which is due next
Wednesday.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.600
I'm giving enough time so you
can plan your moves.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.508
Then, I will probably give you
one last problem set with two or

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:29.230
three problems on whatever I do
near the end.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.198
We'll have to play it by ear.
Okay, so this is another new

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:40.891
topic on thermodynamics,
a fresh beginning for those who

00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:44.996
want a fresh beginning.
And there's also stuff you

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:49.060
probably have seen in high
school, some of it at least.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.899
So, the whole next four
lectures are devoted to the

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.895
study of heat,
temperature,

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:57.660
heat transfer,
things like that.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.525
So, we are going to start with
the intuitive definition of

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:07.470
temperature everybody has.
So, hang on to that;

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.616
that's the right intuition.
But as physicists,

00:01:11.616 --> 00:01:15.670
of course, we want to be more
precise, more careful.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.590
So, let's say you have the
notion of hot and cold.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.680
Even that requires a little
more precision.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.360
That introduces the notion of
what is called thermodynamic

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.557
equilibrium.
Just like mechanical

00:01:34.557 --> 00:01:37.020
equilibrium, this is a very
important concept.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.909
So, I'll tell you what
equilibrium is with a concrete

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.715
example.
If you take a cup of hot water,

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:56.530
and you take another cup of
cold water, each cup,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.857
if you waited sufficiently
long, is said to be in a state

00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:03.184
of equilibrium as long as the
cups were isolated from the

00:02:03.184 --> 00:02:06.629
outside world and not allowed to
cool down or heat up.

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:09.120
We think they maintain a
certain temperature.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.608
We say it's in a state of
thermal equilibrium because this

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:16.599
temperature does not seem to
change.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.706
Now, we have not defined what
temperature it is precisely,

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.867
but we can talk about whether
whatever it is has changed or

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:25.462
not changed.
So, it will settle down to some

00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:28.240
temperature and it will maintain
the temperature.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.084
Be very careful.
If you leave a cup of coffee in

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:35.314
this room, it will cool down
because the room has got a

00:02:35.314 --> 00:02:38.310
different temperature.
But I'm talking about a cup of

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.560
coffee that's been isolated from
everything;

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.616
it maintains the temperature.
Here's another cup of cold

00:02:43.616 --> 00:02:46.599
drink at what we feel is a lower
temperature.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.520
They are both in a state of
equilibrium.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.212
Equilibrium is when the
macroscopic properties of the

00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:58.711
system have stopped changing.
If you now pour one of these

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.811
cups into the other one,
that's going to be a period

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.275
when the system is not in
equilibrium in the sense that it

00:03:05.275 --> 00:03:08.009
doesn't have a well-defined
temperature.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.760
For example,
if you just poured it from the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.219
top, the hot stuff is on the
top,

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.543
the cold stuff is on the
bottom, there's a period of

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:15.821
transition when you really
cannot even say what the

00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.277
temperature of the mixture is.
Some parts are hot,

00:03:18.277 --> 00:03:21.026
some parts are cold;
that system doesn't have a

00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:23.332
temperature.
But if you wait long enough

00:03:23.332 --> 00:03:26.090
until the two parts have gotten
to know each other,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.706
they will turn into some
undrinkable mess,

00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:32.789
but the nice thing is it will
have a well-defined temperature.

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.629
That's, again,
a system in equilibrium.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.961
So, you've got to understand
that temperature and thermal

00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:44.061
equilibrium represent gross
macroscopic properties and

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:48.171
they're not always defined.
At the microscopic level --

00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:51.975
it's no secret -- we all know
everything is made of atoms and

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:54.699
molecules.
The atoms and molecules that

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.770
form the liquid or the gas
always have well-defined states.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.379
Each molecule has a certain
location, certain velocity.

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.344
But at a macroscopic level,
when you don't look into the

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:08.156
fine details,
focus on a few things like

00:04:08.156 --> 00:04:10.722
temperature,
they don't always have a

00:04:10.722 --> 00:04:12.737
well-defined value;
that's what you've got to

00:04:12.737 --> 00:04:14.243
understand.
Things have a well-defined

00:04:14.243 --> 00:04:15.729
value when they have settled
down.

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.740
How long does it take to settle
down?

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.410
That's a matter of what system
you're studying.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.738
But generally,
you can all tell when it has

00:04:23.738 --> 00:04:25.879
settled down.
Here's another example.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:30.343
Suppose you take a gas and you
put it inside this piston here,

00:04:30.343 --> 00:04:33.342
put some gas inside,
you put some weights,

00:04:33.342 --> 00:04:36.050
and everything is in
equilibrium.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.975
We say that it's in equilibrium
because the macroscopic things,

00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:43.900
things you can see with your
naked eye, nothing is changing.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.347
It's going to just sit there.
But if you suddenly now remove,

00:04:47.347 --> 00:04:51.350
say, a third of the weights,
the piston's going to rise up,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.361
shake around a little bit,
maybe settle down in a new

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:57.814
location.
If you wait a few seconds,

00:04:57.814 --> 00:05:00.530
then the new location will
again settle down,

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.233
and you won't see anything with
the naked eye that looks like

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:07.471
anything is happening.
In between you will see the

00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:09.567
pistons moving,
the gas is turbulent,

00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:12.886
the pressure is high in some
regions, low in some regions,

00:05:12.886 --> 00:05:16.503
then it settles down.
This is the notion of systems

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:18.679
in equilibrium,
and in between,

00:05:18.679 --> 00:05:23.250
there are states of the system
which are not in equilibrium.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.138
Now, whenever a system is in
such equilibrium,

00:05:27.138 --> 00:05:31.026
we can assign to it a
temperature that we call

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:33.372
T.
Right now, we don't know

00:05:33.372 --> 00:05:36.478
anything about this temperature,
so we're going to build it up

00:05:36.478 --> 00:05:39.381
from scratch--other than your
instinctive feeling for what

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.533
temperature is.
One of the laws of

00:05:41.533 --> 00:05:45.122
thermodynamics is called a
zeroth law --zeroth law because

00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:48.692
they wrote down the first law,
then they went back and had an

00:05:48.692 --> 00:05:51.180
idea which was even more
profound, and they said,

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.331
"We'll call it zeroth law."
Zeroth law says,

00:05:54.331 --> 00:05:57.746
"if a and b are
at the same temperature,

00:05:57.746 --> 00:06:01.420
and b and c are
at the same temperature,

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.089
then a and c are
at the same temperature."

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:10.000
Now, I see disbelief in the
audience today.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.947
Why do you call this a law?
Look, I think that is the key

00:06:12.947 --> 00:06:16.449
to our being able to speak about
temperature globally,

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:18.638
is the assumption that if I
take a thermometer and measure

00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:20.690
something there,
and I come back and dip the

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.110
thermometer here,
and it reads the same number,

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.083
then I may conclude these two
entities, which never met each

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.709
other directly,
are also the same temperature.

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:31.385
That's not--That seems pretty
obvious to you,

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:34.730
but the whole notion of
temperature is predicated on the

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.075
fact that you can define an
attribute called temperature

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:41.662
that can be globally compared
between two systems that never

00:06:41.662 --> 00:06:44.940
met directly,
but met a third system.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:49.401
Okay.
So, once we have some idea of

00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:52.399
hot and cold,
let us decide now to be more

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:54.452
quantitative.
It's like saying,

00:06:54.452 --> 00:06:57.100
you know, somebody's tall and
short is not enough.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.864
We go into how tall,
how many feet,

00:06:58.864 --> 00:07:00.940
how many inches,
how many millimeters.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.182
So, we want to get quantitative.
All we have right now is a

00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:07.394
notion of hot and cold.
So, what we try to do is to

00:07:07.394 --> 00:07:12.079
find some way to be more precise
about how hot and how cold.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:16.409
So, what people said is,
"Let's look at some things in

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:20.329
the world that seem to depend on
temperature."

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:23.990
One thing that seems to depend
on temperature is the following.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.409
You take this meter stick in
the National Bureau Standards,

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.180
kept in some glass case,
at some temperature.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.506
You pull it out--or make a
duplicate of it,

00:07:32.506 --> 00:07:35.110
you pull it outside and leave
it in the room.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.921
What you may find is that if
the room was hotter than the

00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:42.459
glass case, this rod then
expands to a new length.

00:07:42.459 --> 00:07:45.523
So, one rod is outside the
case, one rod is inside the case

00:07:45.523 --> 00:07:49.172
so the comparison is meaningful.
Nothing has been done to this

00:07:49.172 --> 00:07:53.389
guy in the air-conditioned glass
case, but this one is expanding.

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.994
So, one way to define
temperature is to simply ask how

00:07:56.994 --> 00:07:59.850
long is this rod,
and somehow correlate the

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:03.590
length of the rod with
temperature by some fashion.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.864
So, you can do that.
So, what you need to do

00:08:07.864 --> 00:08:10.896
that--what you need to do first
is to define,

00:08:10.896 --> 00:08:14.892
put some markings on it so that
for each extra something it

00:08:14.892 --> 00:08:16.994
grows,
we can say the temperature has

00:08:16.994 --> 00:08:19.678
gone up by some amount.
So, there we need units for

00:08:19.678 --> 00:08:22.180
temperature, that's completely
arbitrary.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.937
And you need some standards,
just like this meter stick,

00:08:25.937 --> 00:08:29.626
you know, it's not--nothing
intrinsic in nature about a

00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:31.350
meter,
we just made it up and said

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.882
"Let's call that a meter."
In the case of the meter,

00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:37.463
the zeroth law is if you bring
a meter stick next to mine and

00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:39.724
we agree,
you can take the meter stick

00:08:39.724 --> 00:08:43.090
somewhere else and define that
to be the meter because if this

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.179
stick is as long as that one and
as long as that one,

00:08:46.179 --> 00:08:48.250
then those two are equal in
length.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.295
But temperature--You are
similarly going to use this rod

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:54.727
and say, "This rod is a certain
length when kept on top of this

00:08:54.727 --> 00:08:57.883
bucket of some fluid and the
same length when I keep it on

00:08:57.883 --> 00:09:00.619
that bucket,
then the two buckets are the

00:09:00.619 --> 00:09:04.273
same temperature."
So, we can use markings on this

00:09:04.273 --> 00:09:08.423
rod compared to the unexpanded
length as a measure of

00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:11.600
temperature.
So, what people do is to pick

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.399
something a little easier than
this rod.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:18.730
They notice the liquids expand
when you heat them.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.998
That's why in a summer day if
you fill your gas tank,

00:09:21.998 --> 00:09:25.895
you have to leave some room at
the top so the overflow can come

00:09:25.895 --> 00:09:28.315
out of the top;
or you shouldn't fill it

00:09:28.315 --> 00:09:30.510
completely, otherwise it'll bust
the tank.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.239
So, liquids expand.
So, one way to measure

00:09:34.239 --> 00:09:38.226
temperature may be take some
liquid, put it there,

00:09:38.226 --> 00:09:42.619
and then put it in hot rooms
and maybe watch the liquid

00:09:42.619 --> 00:09:47.408
expand to the new height.
And then draw some markings,

00:09:47.408 --> 00:09:51.350
and each marking can be a
certain temperature.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:55.419
But people had a better idea
than this one.

00:09:55.419 --> 00:09:58.500
They had the following idea of
a thermometer,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.789
where you have a lot of fluid
in a reservoir,

00:10:01.789 --> 00:10:07.334
a very thin tube evacuated at
the top, and the fluid,

00:10:07.334 --> 00:10:11.270
then, is here.
So, what's clever about this is

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:15.227
that if this expands by one
percent, your eyes should be

00:10:15.227 --> 00:10:19.039
good enough to see one percent
increase in height.

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:21.640
If this fluid expands by one
percent in volume,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.976
that one percent in volume and
it climbs up this narrow tube

00:10:24.976 --> 00:10:27.860
can climb to quite a bit
[pointing to picture],

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.756
because the extra volume you
get by expansion will be the

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:36.000
area of this tube times the
extra ∆x by which it expands.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.981
So, you're magnifying the
expansion by making all the

00:10:38.981 --> 00:10:42.019
expander fluid climb up this
extremely narrow tube.

00:10:42.019 --> 00:10:45.800
In fact, the tube is so narrow,
you cannot probably even see it

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.519
well, which is why they have a
little prism that magnifies the

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:52.080
mercury or alcohol in the
thermometer.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.519
Okay, so we have some way of
following temperature now.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:58.866
We can draw some lines,
arbitrary lines,

00:10:58.866 --> 00:11:00.950
it doesn't matter.
That can be zero,

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.710
that can be five,
that can be 19;

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.730
you've just got to make sure
that it's monotonic.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:09.862
Then whenever it's on 21,
we may argue that 21 is now

00:11:09.862 --> 00:11:13.373
hotter than 19.
But you want a better scale

00:11:13.373 --> 00:11:15.132
than that.
Even though that's

00:11:15.132 --> 00:11:18.336
mathematically adequate in
practice, what people decide is

00:11:18.336 --> 00:11:21.226
to do it as follows.
They said, "We want to set up

00:11:21.226 --> 00:11:23.870
thermometers so that people all
over the world,

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.069
in different parts of the
world, different countries,

00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:29.146
different labs can all agree.
So, we will make it possible

00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:32.805
for everyone to make their own
thermometer by the following

00:11:32.805 --> 00:11:35.799
recipe."
We will dip this guy in a

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:40.029
bucket which has got some ice
and some water.

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:44.783
That's called the melting point
of water, so that--or the

00:11:44.783 --> 00:11:47.965
freezing point of water;
melting point of ice,

00:11:47.965 --> 00:11:50.149
or freezing point of water,
it doesn't matter.

00:11:50.149 --> 00:11:53.613
We notice that as water cools
down, in the world around us

00:11:53.613 --> 00:11:55.740
suddenly ice cubes begin to
form.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.755
We go to the temperature at
which that happens for the first

00:11:58.755 --> 00:12:00.799
time and we dip the thermometer
there,

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:04.671
and whatever reading we get we
will postulate to be zero

00:12:04.671 --> 00:12:08.659
degrees centigrade.
That is just a definition.

00:12:08.659 --> 00:12:12.880
We believe that's a good
definition because people all

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.249
over the world can do that.
Of course, if you live in

00:12:16.249 --> 00:12:18.030
Kuwait, that's not going to work
for you;

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.712
there's no ice.
But they figured out in parts

00:12:20.712 --> 00:12:24.259
of the world where you have ice,
this is a very good definition.

00:12:24.259 --> 00:12:27.740
You get ice,
you got zero degrees.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.484
Then they said,
"Let's find another universally

00:12:30.484 --> 00:12:32.931
accessible thing," which,
as you all know,

00:12:32.931 --> 00:12:36.431
is the boiling point of water.
If you put water on the stove

00:12:36.431 --> 00:12:39.423
it heats up and heats up and
heats up and suddenly it begins

00:12:39.423 --> 00:12:41.250
to bubble and boil and
evaporate.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:45.236
That temperature is going to be
called 100 degrees,

00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:47.230
100 degrees centigrade.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.750
Then, you take this column
between zero and 100,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.290
and you divide it into 100
equal parts.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:04.467
And that is postulated to be
the temperature anywhere between

00:13:04.467 --> 00:13:07.919
zero and 100.
If you have gone 79 percent of

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:10.731
the way to the top,
from here to here,

00:13:10.731 --> 00:13:13.240
the temperature is 79 degrees.

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:18.504
That's how the degrees were
introduced, and that's a

00:13:18.504 --> 00:13:20.234
centigrade scale,
and you guys know there are

00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:22.344
different scales.
You can have the Fahrenheit

00:13:22.344 --> 00:13:25.197
scale, you can have any other
scale in which what you want to

00:13:25.197 --> 00:13:27.100
call the freezing point is
different.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.370
Somebody thinks it's zero,
somebody thinks it's 32.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.886
And you can again call this
something else,

00:13:31.886 --> 00:13:34.702
and you can divide this
interval into 100 parts,

00:13:34.702 --> 00:13:38.009
180 parts, whatever you like.
But the philosophy is the same.

00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:41.157
You have to find two points,
which are reproducible,

00:13:41.157 --> 00:13:43.749
conveniently,
and divide the region between

00:13:43.749 --> 00:13:46.279
them into some number of equal
steps.

00:13:46.279 --> 00:13:49.379
If there's 100 equal steps,
you say it's a centigrade

00:13:49.379 --> 00:13:52.240
scale, provided the lowest one
is called zero.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.830
This is how you have
thermometers.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.100
Now, there are some problems
with this.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:03.733
One problem is that the boiling
point of water does not seem to

00:14:03.733 --> 00:14:07.960
be very reliable.
Because if you boil water in

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.069
Aspen, for example,
you know it doesn't seem to

00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:17.250
boil--it seems to boil more
readily than in the plains.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.879
You can ask,
"How do you know that?"

00:14:18.879 --> 00:14:20.700
maybe it is still doing the
same thing.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.189
I know that because I tried to
cook something,

00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:26.730
cook some rice and vegetables,
I find, they don't cook at all.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:29.049
In Denver, it boils before it
cooks;

00:14:29.049 --> 00:14:32.605
that way we know it's probably
boiling earlier in the mountains

00:14:32.605 --> 00:14:36.313
than in the plains.
So, who's going to decide what

00:14:36.313 --> 00:14:40.156
the real temperature is?
So, you have to be more careful

00:14:40.156 --> 00:14:42.820
when you say boiling point and
freezing point,

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:46.808
because things don't seem to
boil at a certain,

00:14:46.808 --> 00:14:49.929
predictable and fixed
temperature.

00:14:49.929 --> 00:14:53.586
This is a very deep argument I
have never appreciated fully

00:14:53.586 --> 00:14:57.054
when I was learning the subject,
is that it's all cyclic

00:14:57.054 --> 00:14:59.822
definition.
Because you may not know that

00:14:59.822 --> 00:15:03.277
the temperature is changing,
because this thermometer by

00:15:03.277 --> 00:15:07.110
postulate, it's going to be the
temperature by definition.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.297
How can it be wrong?
What's wrong is that you know

00:15:10.297 --> 00:15:13.669
it's not a reliable method
because physical phenomena,

00:15:13.669 --> 00:15:17.052
like when your rice will cook,
are not reproduced by the

00:15:17.052 --> 00:15:19.595
boiling point of water.
It cooks in the plains,

00:15:19.595 --> 00:15:21.651
it doesn't cook in the
mountains, so we know the

00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:24.409
boiling point is to blame.
Rice is the rice.

00:15:24.409 --> 00:15:26.529
That's how we know that that's
not a good measure.

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:28.228
So nowadays,
people have much fancier

00:15:28.228 --> 00:15:30.870
measures, and I will tell you a
little bit about that.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.370
But for a long time,
this was a very good start.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.609
Don't worry about the fact that
water boils differently at

00:15:36.609 --> 00:15:39.992
different altitudes;
you could go to sea level and

00:15:39.992 --> 00:15:43.381
that's a good enough definition.
Sea level is pretty much

00:15:43.381 --> 00:15:45.746
constant all over the world,
and you can say the pressure of

00:15:45.746 --> 00:15:47.429
sea level is the pressure at sea
level;

00:15:47.429 --> 00:15:49.940
just the ρgh of the
atmosphere.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.450
Okay, so that's the usual
definition of temperature.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.743
Now, the trouble started when
people realized that if you make

00:15:58.743 --> 00:16:01.629
a thermometer with your favorite
fluid,

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:04.116
maybe mercury,
and I make one with alcohol,

00:16:04.116 --> 00:16:07.492
they will agree at zero and
they will agree at 100 because

00:16:07.492 --> 00:16:10.328
that's how you fixed it.
You rigged it so at zero

00:16:10.328 --> 00:16:12.889
everyone says zero;
100 everyone says 100.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:17.399
But how about 74 degrees,
or 75 degrees?

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:21.142
I say it's 75 if my fluid has
climbed three-fourths of the way

00:16:21.142 --> 00:16:22.913
to the top.
At that point,

00:16:22.913 --> 00:16:26.600
yours may not have climbed
three-fourths of the way.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.247
In other words,
you've got two things,

00:16:29.247 --> 00:16:32.539
two graphs, which have zero and
100 degrees;

00:16:32.539 --> 00:16:35.059
one graph may be like this,
one may be like that.

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:38.070
So that when I think it is 75,
you may think it is 72.

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.070
At 100, we will agree because
we have cooked it up that way.

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.562
In other words,
it's not true that all liquids

00:16:44.562 --> 00:16:48.665
expand at the same rate.
So, you will have to then pick

00:16:48.665 --> 00:16:51.723
one liquid and say,
"We swear by that liquid,

00:16:51.723 --> 00:16:55.406
and when that liquid's gone
halfway, we'll say it's 50

00:16:55.406 --> 00:16:57.810
degrees."
So, you will have to pick a

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.830
liquid, you'll have to have an
international convention,

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.003
you know, there's the alcohol
lobby and there's the no alcohol

00:17:04.003 --> 00:17:05.140
lobby;
they argue.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.211
Finally, they found out a much
better solution than these

00:17:08.211 --> 00:17:10.830
liquids.
They found out that if you use

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:14.005
a gas--You can define
temperature using gasses,

00:17:14.005 --> 00:17:17.180
which have some very,
very nice properties.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:23.920
And this is the gas thermometer
that I'm going to tell you now.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.730
So, here is how you build a gas
thermometer.

00:17:29.769 --> 00:17:32.390
You take some gas in a
container.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:36.209
A typical container for me in
all--whenever I draw anything

00:17:36.209 --> 00:17:38.974
thermodynamics,
it's going to be gas inside

00:17:38.974 --> 00:17:41.740
some cylinder with some weights
on it,

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.019
and that defines the pressure
of the gas.

00:17:46.019 --> 00:17:49.907
Of course, the pressure will be
the mg of these weights

00:17:49.907 --> 00:17:52.329
divided by the area of the
cylinder.

00:17:52.329 --> 00:17:55.599
That's the pressure,
plus atmospheric pressure.

00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:59.349
And the volume is this,
whatever the volume is,

00:17:59.349 --> 00:18:05.349
base times height.
Here's what we ask you to do.

00:18:05.349 --> 00:18:08.866
Take the product of pressure
times volume for any sample of

00:18:08.866 --> 00:18:10.190
gas.
Take some gas,

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:13.412
put it in this tank,
and now put it on different

00:18:13.412 --> 00:18:16.295
surfaces, like a hot plate,
like a stove,

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:19.280
like a tub of water,
and measure the temperature

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.900
using some standard method up to
that point like a mercury

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.013
thermometer.
What you notice is that the

00:18:26.013 --> 00:18:30.533
temperature measured by some
reasonable scheme shows that the

00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:34.827
product of P times
V lies on a straight line

00:18:34.827 --> 00:18:37.690
[drawing diagonal line on
board].

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:41.811
If you connect the dots,
you find the product PV

00:18:41.811 --> 00:18:44.940
is linear in this temperature
variable.

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.280
And this is zero degrees,
and this is 100 degrees.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.269
Now, here is the beauty of the
gas thermometer.

00:18:59.269 --> 00:19:03.227
If you take a different gas and
you put a different amount of

00:19:03.227 --> 00:19:06.854
different gas in a different
cylinder, you will get some

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.315
other graph;
it may look like this [drawing

00:19:08.315 --> 00:19:08.640
another straight line].

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:15.980
For you, that is zero and
that's 100.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.519
But the most important thing is
that's also a straight line.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:23.892
That it's also a straight line,
has the following implication

00:19:23.892 --> 00:19:26.880
you guys can prove at your own
leisure,

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.728
which is that,
if I think that my gas has

00:19:30.728 --> 00:19:36.309
climbed 56 percent of the way of
this height to the top,

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:39.766
so the temperature is 56
degrees, I ask what's your gas

00:19:39.766 --> 00:19:43.799
done, you will find yours also
climbed 56 percent of the way.

00:19:43.799 --> 00:19:45.619
It's the property of straight
lines.

00:19:45.619 --> 00:19:48.537
You can show that if you took
two straight lines,

00:19:48.537 --> 00:19:51.029
whatever be their slope,
if they agree,

00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:54.601
if this is zero and this is
100, it has got a different

00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:58.039
slope, when you have climbed to
the halfway point,

00:19:58.039 --> 00:20:01.487
draw a line at 50 degrees and
ask what has any gas done,

00:20:01.487 --> 00:20:05.247
they will all have climbed to
the halfway point from the zero

00:20:05.247 --> 00:20:08.054
point to the 100 point.
In other words,

00:20:08.054 --> 00:20:12.437
gas thermometers will not only
agree at the end points where

00:20:12.437 --> 00:20:16.671
they must, by construction,
they seem to agree all the way

00:20:16.671 --> 00:20:20.050
in between.
But there is one requirement.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.940
This gas has to be very dilute.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.579
The more diluted it is,
the better it comes out.

00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:33.230
So, take neon or Freon or
whatever you like.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.609
Don't pump it up with a lot of
gas;

00:20:35.609 --> 00:20:37.529
put the least amount of gas you
can get away with.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:41.241
Then, you find all gasses have
the property that if you

00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:45.090
calibrate them at zero and 100,
they agree in between.

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:48.933
Is that clear to you?
Take the product P times

00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:52.769
V of your gas by putting
it on different surfaces,

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:55.509
measure the product,
plot this graph.

00:20:55.509 --> 00:20:58.422
Whenever you're on ice
[freezing point of water]

00:20:58.422 --> 00:21:01.430
you call it zero;
whenever you're on boiling

00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:05.207
water you call it 100.
You find they're connected by a

00:21:05.207 --> 00:21:08.130
straight line,
then every point in between,

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:11.754
you've divided equally,
leads to equal increase in the

00:21:11.754 --> 00:21:15.309
product P times V.
P times V for a

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:18.428
gas is better than the volume of
mercury or volume of water

00:21:18.428 --> 00:21:20.579
because it doesn't depend on the
gas.

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:25.259
So, everybody can use the gas
thermometer.

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:27.710
That's why we prefer the gas
thermometer.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.552
So, this is the interesting
issue about measurement or

00:21:31.552 --> 00:21:35.250
definitions and cyclic
definitions--you've got to be

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:37.935
careful.
The laws of nature allow you to

00:21:37.935 --> 00:21:41.331
pick anything you like that
varies with temperature and use

00:21:41.331 --> 00:21:44.670
that as a definition of
temperature, as a thermometer.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.460
So, why are some thermometers
preferred over the others?

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.911
They're preferred over the
others if the laws of nature

00:21:50.911 --> 00:21:54.363
take the simplest form when
described in terms of those

00:21:54.363 --> 00:21:56.307
thermometers.
In other words,

00:21:56.307 --> 00:22:00.201
take a meter stick.
What makes a good meter stick

00:22:00.201 --> 00:22:03.021
for a standard?
You say the one that doesn't

00:22:03.021 --> 00:22:05.019
expand, but we don't know what
that means.

00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:06.880
That meter stick is the
standard;

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.623
by definition it's right.
But then, you will soon find

00:22:09.623 --> 00:22:12.329
out that it's not really that
simple, because there are good

00:22:12.329 --> 00:22:14.006
and bad meter sticks.
For example,

00:22:14.006 --> 00:22:16.649
the same meter stick at one
time out of the year doesn't

00:22:16.649 --> 00:22:19.339
match its own length at a
different time of the year;

00:22:19.339 --> 00:22:21.329
then we know that it's not a
good meter stick.

00:22:21.329 --> 00:22:23.404
Similarly, there are good and
bad thermometers,

00:22:23.404 --> 00:22:25.750
and people arrive on the gas
thermometer this way.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:29.965
If you have a gas thermometer,
something very interesting came

00:22:29.965 --> 00:22:34.393
out of the gas thermometer.
If you cool it below zero and

00:22:34.393 --> 00:22:39.408
you ask which way is it going,
I don't know how low you could

00:22:39.408 --> 00:22:40.884
go.
In the old days,

00:22:40.884 --> 00:22:44.173
people couldn't go far below
zero, but now we can go to

00:22:44.173 --> 00:22:47.279
one-billionth of a degree above
a certain point.

00:22:47.279 --> 00:22:50.721
I'll tell you now,
these thermometers indicate

00:22:50.721 --> 00:22:55.310
somehow the product PV
vanishes at a temperature which

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:59.544
is minus 273.16,
suggesting that there is

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:04.839
something very special about
that temperature.

00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:08.383
Because if you took another
gas--well, I'm going to do a

00:23:08.383 --> 00:23:11.799
little cheating here--that also
extrapolates that same

00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:13.770
temperature.
So, all gasses,

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.594
all gas thermometers say there
is something very special about

00:23:17.594 --> 00:23:21.670
this temperature because that's
when our pressures all vanish.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.603
So, as you cool a given amount
of gas, even at a given volume,

00:23:25.603 --> 00:23:29.859
if you keep the volume constant
and ask what pressure do I need,

00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:31.440
how many weights do I have to
put on;

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.130
that decreases and vanishes at
this temperature.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:38.100
And this is called the absolute
zero of temperature.

00:23:42.599 --> 00:23:45.299
It's called absolute zero for
many reasons.

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:48.536
One is that unlike the zero of
the centigrade,

00:23:48.536 --> 00:23:51.989
which is by no means the
absolute lowest possible

00:23:51.989 --> 00:23:55.462
temperature,
the absolute zero is the lowest

00:23:55.462 --> 00:23:58.240
possible temperature.
Why?

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.957
Because the gas pressure can be
reduced and reduced and reduced,

00:24:00.957 --> 00:24:03.460
but the worst that can happen
is that it can go to zero.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.911
That's it.
It cannot go below having no

00:24:06.911 --> 00:24:09.251
pressure.
We'll find in other ways,

00:24:09.251 --> 00:24:12.173
also, this is the temperature
at which you will see

00:24:12.173 --> 00:24:14.920
conceptually no further cooling
is possible.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.317
That will require you to
understand what hot and cold

00:24:17.317 --> 00:24:18.392
mean.
But right now,

00:24:18.392 --> 00:24:21.509
this says all gas thermometers
point at this temperature.

00:24:21.509 --> 00:24:24.247
So, people decided,
"You know what,

00:24:24.247 --> 00:24:27.710
calling this zero is kind of
artificial."

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.390
That's based on human obsession
with water.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.971
But if you think laws of
science describe the whole

00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:38.840
universe, what about planets
where there's no water?

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.500
Right?
You cannot describe--Suppose

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.580
you're talking to a different
civilization;

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.299
Planet of the Apes.
You want to tell those guys,

00:24:49.299 --> 00:24:50.940
"We're going to set up our
temperatures;

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:53.266
zero is when water freezes,"
and they say,

00:24:53.266 --> 00:24:55.310
"What is this thing called
water?"

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.887
"You know, the stuff you drink."
You don't know what these apes

00:24:57.887 --> 00:25:01.008
are drinking.
Maybe they're drinking methane

00:25:01.008 --> 00:25:03.779
or liquid hydrogen.
We don't know.

00:25:03.779 --> 00:25:07.151
On the other hand,
you say, "Take any vapor and

00:25:07.151 --> 00:25:11.769
wait until the product of the
pressure and volume go to zero,

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:15.029
let's call that zero," that's
the universal standard.

00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:18.109
It's not tied to something
called water.

00:25:18.109 --> 00:25:20.978
It was fine for a while,
but it is not fine as a

00:25:20.978 --> 00:25:23.420
universal aspiration for
thermometers.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.529
So, zero of temperatures can be
set from here.

00:25:27.529 --> 00:25:30.692
Once they did that,
they called that zero,

00:25:30.692 --> 00:25:33.470
they needed one other
temperature.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:37.307
And they decided that if you're
starting the new temperature

00:25:37.307 --> 00:25:40.558
scale, you will put the zero not
at the centigrade,

00:25:40.558 --> 00:25:44.461
but this is now called Kelvin.
And everything will follow a

00:25:44.461 --> 00:25:47.058
straight line,
but to define what one degree

00:25:47.058 --> 00:25:50.259
means, you've got to define one
other temperature.

00:25:50.259 --> 00:25:51.849
That's how we define the
straight line;

00:25:51.849 --> 00:25:57.279
that temperature would be
called 273.16.

00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:01.170
But this point is called the
triple point of water.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.880
What's the triple point of
water?

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:08.089
You know water and ice can
coexist, and you know that water

00:26:08.089 --> 00:26:10.920
and steam can coexist at 100
degrees.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.840
But by varying the pressure and
temperature and volume,

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.410
you can actually find a certain
magical point in which both ice,

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.920
water and steam can coexist,
simultaneously.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:27.160
It cannot pick between those
three options.

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.453
Ice floating on water is when
water has not decided whether to

00:26:30.453 --> 00:26:33.372
be ice or to be water.
That's the coexistence point of

00:26:33.372 --> 00:26:35.326
two things.
And when the water starts

00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:37.926
boiling on your stove,
that's when water and steam

00:26:37.926 --> 00:26:40.512
coexist.
But I'm saying that certain

00:26:40.512 --> 00:26:44.665
conditions of pressure and
temperature and volume so that

00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:47.410
water, ice and steam will
coexist.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:51.528
Now, that is a unique situation;
you cannot get to that by any

00:26:51.528 --> 00:26:55.097
other means.
And that temperature we will

00:26:55.097 --> 00:26:59.309
call plus 273.16 in these
absolute units.

00:26:59.309 --> 00:27:02.083
So, basically,
what you have done by going to

00:27:02.083 --> 00:27:05.488
the absolute units is you've
shifted the zero to a more

00:27:05.488 --> 00:27:08.009
natural point where all graphs
meet;

00:27:08.009 --> 00:27:12.287
then, you define one degree
Kelvin to be so that 273.16 of

00:27:12.287 --> 00:27:16.339
that Kelvin brings you to the
triple point of water.

00:27:16.339 --> 00:27:19.014
So, if you found that
confusing, I'm just saying the

00:27:19.014 --> 00:27:21.480
boiling point of water is not a
fixed number.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.049
You go to the mountains,
it changes.

00:27:23.049 --> 00:27:28.710
But only under one condition
can water and ice and steam

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:32.443
coexist.
You cannot get that any other

00:27:32.443 --> 00:27:34.787
way.
So, everybody will agree on

00:27:34.787 --> 00:27:38.404
that particular situation,
that will be called 273.16

00:27:38.404 --> 00:27:42.450
Kelvin.
Now there is a rule, apparently.

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:45.074
You can say,
"degree centigrade," you're not

00:27:45.074 --> 00:27:47.210
supposed to say,
"degree Kelvin."

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.579
There was a big deal made in a
lot of books.

00:27:50.579 --> 00:27:53.440
I keep forgetting--In fact,
I forgot again,

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.299
and nothing terrible has
happened to me.

00:27:56.299 --> 00:27:59.037
So, I don't think you should
pay too much attention to

00:27:59.037 --> 00:28:01.878
whether you can call something
"degree Kelvin" or simply

00:28:01.878 --> 00:28:04.190
"Kelvin."
I think the purpose of language

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.455
is to have no ambiguities.
But when they say,

00:28:06.455 --> 00:28:09.194
"degree Kelvin" and I find that
you guys don't get confused,

00:28:09.194 --> 00:28:10.819
I don't think that's a big
deal.

00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:13.825
But you'll find if you're a
very erudite person,

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:16.319
you will never write "degree
Kelvin."

00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:18.888
But having said that,
don't hold me to those

00:28:18.888 --> 00:28:22.829
standards--I just don't feel any
affiliation to this particular,

00:28:22.829 --> 00:28:26.450
completely artificial and empty
convention.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.794
But you are supposed to
remember, if you take the GRE or

00:28:29.794 --> 00:28:32.529
something, it's not called
"degree Kelvin."

00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:36.192
Okay so, as far as we are
concerned, the Kelvin scale is

00:28:36.192 --> 00:28:39.920
like the centigrade scale,
except the zero has shifted to

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.829
here.
That's it.

00:28:41.829 --> 00:28:45.470
That's the temperature scale
you will use.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.816
That's the absolute temperature.
Whenever I write T from

00:28:48.816 --> 00:28:51.859
now on, I'm talking about
Kelvin, not centigrade.

00:28:51.859 --> 00:28:57.890
Now, that's all about heat--I
mean, all about temperature.

00:28:57.890 --> 00:28:59.910
Now, I'm going to talk about
heat.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.272
So, heat is denoted by the
symbol Q,

00:29:02.272 --> 00:29:05.759
and you've got to ask yourself,
"What are we talking about when

00:29:05.759 --> 00:29:09.394
we talk about heat?"
Again, let's use your intuitive

00:29:09.394 --> 00:29:12.510
sense of what heat is.
Say I have a bucket of water;

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.359
I want to heat it up.
And how do you do that?

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:17.962
You put the bucket on top of
something else which you think

00:29:17.962 --> 00:29:20.250
is hotter, and when the two are
brought together,

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.859
somehow the water begins to
feel hotter and hotter.

00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:26.818
So, we say we've heated the
water, and we say we have

00:29:26.818 --> 00:29:30.109
transferred heat.
Now, people were not sure what

00:29:30.109 --> 00:29:34.048
really was being transferred.
What is it that's going from

00:29:34.048 --> 00:29:37.217
the stove to the water?
Why is it that the stove,

00:29:37.217 --> 00:29:40.862
if it's not plugged in,
is getting cooler and the water

00:29:40.862 --> 00:29:44.228
is getting hotter?
They just decided to call it

00:29:44.228 --> 00:29:45.550
the caloric fluid.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.656
They imagined there was a
certain fluid which is abundant

00:29:53.656 --> 00:29:56.347
in hot things,
and not so abundant in cold

00:29:56.347 --> 00:29:58.561
things.
When you put hot and cold

00:29:58.561 --> 00:30:01.604
together, this magical fluid
flows from hot to cold,

00:30:01.604 --> 00:30:04.170
and in the process heats the
cold thing.

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.930
And they decided to measure it
in calories.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:10.789
And so, you have to define what
a calorie is.

00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:12.830
In other words,
you want to ask,

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:16.779
"How much heat does it take to
heat this bucket of water?"

00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:22.175
And the rule they made up was,
we're going to define something

00:30:22.175 --> 00:30:27.127
called a calorie where the
number of calories you need is

00:30:27.127 --> 00:30:32.700
equal to the mass of water times
the change in temperature.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:37.438
That's going to be calories.
In other words,

00:30:37.438 --> 00:30:40.529
if I had a container with 10
grams of water,

00:30:40.529 --> 00:30:43.261
and the temperature went
up--I'm sorry,

00:30:43.261 --> 00:30:45.850
this is mass of water in grams.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.207
If you have 1 gram of water,
and you did something to it and

00:30:54.207 --> 00:30:56.780
the temperature went up by seven
degrees, you have,

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.840
by definition,
pumped in 7 calories.

00:31:04.039 --> 00:31:09.392
If this was a kilogram of
water, this would be called a

00:31:09.392 --> 00:31:12.165
kilocalorie.
Sometimes they use grams and

00:31:12.165 --> 00:31:14.157
calories;
sometimes they use kilograms

00:31:14.157 --> 00:31:16.493
and kilocalories.
But the definitions are

00:31:16.493 --> 00:31:18.534
consistent;
if you put a kilo in the gram,

00:31:18.534 --> 00:31:23.440
put a kilo in the calories.
Okay.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.845
Now, suppose you say,
"I don't want to just talk

00:31:26.845 --> 00:31:31.119
about water, I want to talk
about heating something else.

00:31:31.119 --> 00:31:35.119
Maybe I want to heat a gram of
copper."

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:39.359
So, then you write down the
following rule.

00:31:39.359 --> 00:31:44.485
The amount of heat it takes to
heat up anything--pick your own

00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:48.067
favorite material--gold.
Then, the amount of heat,

00:31:48.067 --> 00:31:51.310
I think we can all appreciate,
must be proportionate to the

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:53.770
amount of stuff you're trying to
heat up.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:56.721
That's our intuitive notion.
If you've got one chunk of gold

00:31:56.721 --> 00:31:59.071
that takes some number of
calories, you have a second

00:31:59.071 --> 00:32:00.625
identical chunk;
by definition,

00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:02.910
that should take the same
number of calories.

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.085
You put them together,
it is clear that whatever this

00:32:06.085 --> 00:32:08.589
caloric fluid is,
you need double that.

00:32:08.589 --> 00:32:12.950
So, it's got to be proportional
to the mass of the substance.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:16.476
And it's got to be proportional
to what you're aiming for,

00:32:16.476 --> 00:32:18.579
namely, increase in
temperature.

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:22.009
But this is true for any
substance, whether you're

00:32:22.009 --> 00:32:25.590
heating copper or wood or gold;
no matter what you're heating,

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.046
it is true the heat need is
proportional to mass and to the

00:32:28.046 --> 00:32:29.190
[change in]
temperature.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.748
So, what is it that
distinguishes one material from

00:32:31.748 --> 00:32:33.882
another?
We put a number here,

00:32:33.882 --> 00:32:37.359
and that number is called the
specific heat.

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:40.410
The specific heat is the
property of that material.

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.120
You've got to understand
certain formulas will depend on

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:53.179
certain parameters in a genetic
way, and some things that depend

00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:54.490
on the actual material.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.400
In fact, there's a similar
quantity.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.329
I mean, maybe I'll take a
second to tell you.

00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:03.899
If you go to liquids that I
said were expanding,

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:08.051
you can do the same thing.
Take a rod and start heating it

00:33:08.051 --> 00:33:12.534
and ask, "How much will it
expand if I heat it by some

00:33:12.534 --> 00:33:14.480
amount ∆T?"

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:20.809
What will it be proportional to?
Can anybody think of what it

00:33:20.809 --> 00:33:23.040
may be proportional to?
Yes?

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.836
Student: Original length?
Professor Ramamurti

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:25.870
Shankar: Depends on the
original length of the rod.

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.984
Now, why is that?
Why do we think it's got to be

00:33:27.984 --> 00:33:29.549
proportional to the length of
the rod?

00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:34.817
Student: Because it
expanded based on what it had

00:33:34.817 --> 00:33:36.307
before.
Professor Ramamurti

00:33:36.307 --> 00:33:37.534
Shankar: Yeah,
it's based on what it had

00:33:37.534 --> 00:33:38.539
before.
Yes?

00:33:38.539 --> 00:33:40.443
Student: Well,
each cycle the rod will expand

00:33:40.443 --> 00:33:41.526
by some amount,
so [inaudible]

00:33:41.526 --> 00:33:43.579
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's correct.

00:33:43.579 --> 00:33:46.736
I think one way to say that is
take a meter stick,

00:33:46.736 --> 00:33:50.238
it expands to some amount,
put another meter stick next to

00:33:50.238 --> 00:33:53.033
it, that expands to the same
amount by definition of

00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:56.870
identical things.
For the two-meter stick it will

00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.660
expand by twice as much.
So, we put the length of that.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.443
So, no matter what you're
heating -- a block of wood,

00:34:03.443 --> 00:34:07.424
block of steel -- this is true.
But then, the fact that heat

00:34:07.424 --> 00:34:12.092
has different effects on copper
versus wood, is indicated by

00:34:12.092 --> 00:34:16.961
putting a number here.
That α is called the

00:34:16.961 --> 00:34:22.640
coefficient of linear expansion,
and that depends on the

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.920
material.
These are true no matter what

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.530
you are heating.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.866
So, these specific numbers,
these coefficients,

00:34:30.866 --> 00:34:33.142
these αs that come in
are going to come in all the

00:34:33.142 --> 00:34:34.780
time, so you should get used to
them.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.737
Here's another one.
Let's play this game one more

00:34:37.737 --> 00:34:39.196
time.
We can ask how much does the

00:34:39.196 --> 00:34:40.920
volume of a body change when I
heat it.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.140
Well, the change in the volume,
again, would be proportional to

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:47.050
the starting volume times the
increase in temperature.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.359
Then you put another number;
that's called the coefficient

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:53.650
of volume expansion.
And that depends on the

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.233
material.
So, if you take copper,

00:34:56.233 --> 00:34:59.230
copper will have a certain
α;

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.610
iron will have a different
α;

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.780
wood will have a different
α.

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:03.869
Each material will have a
different α.

00:35:03.869 --> 00:35:05.610
This is the property of the
material.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.034
If you say, "Well,
I had something and when I

00:35:08.034 --> 00:35:11.230
heated it up by one degree,
it increased by nine inches;

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.239
another one increased by two
inches."

00:35:13.239 --> 00:35:16.619
Is it clear that the first one
expands more readily?

00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:19.292
It's not, because the first one
could have been a mile long,

00:35:19.292 --> 00:35:21.150
second one could have been a
foot long.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:23.757
So, you have to take out
certain factors that are

00:35:23.757 --> 00:35:26.963
universal, and the rest of it
you put into a property of the

00:35:26.963 --> 00:35:29.405
material.
Similarly, when you come to

00:35:29.405 --> 00:35:32.168
specific heat,
you ask how much heat does it

00:35:32.168 --> 00:35:35.510
take to heat some object,
it depends on the mass.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.179
It doesn't matter what you're
heating.

00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:39.660
Depends on the increase in
temperature, because that's the

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.737
whole purpose of adding heat;
it's always going to be linear

00:35:42.737 --> 00:35:46.252
in the ∆T.
This one is the property of the

00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:50.673
material, and by definition,
c equal one calorie per

00:35:50.673 --> 00:35:54.560
gram, or one kilocalorie per
kilogram for water.

00:35:59.389 --> 00:36:05.065
Once you've got--So remember,
one calorie per gram for water

00:36:05.065 --> 00:36:09.264
is the definition.
Once you define water to have a

00:36:09.264 --> 00:36:13.740
specific heat of one calorie per
gram, you can define specific

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:17.630
heat for other materials by the
following process.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:22.377
So, what do you do?
You take a container with some

00:36:22.377 --> 00:36:25.413
water in it.
Let's assume the container has

00:36:25.413 --> 00:36:28.010
zero mass, so I don't have to
worry about it.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:30.800
It's an approximation.
If you are worried about that,

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.931
you know, take a huge container
so that the volume of water

00:36:33.931 --> 00:36:36.470
dominates the surface area of
the container.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.760
Anyway, container's neglected;
you've got some water.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.986
This water is of some initial
temperature

00:36:41.986 --> 00:36:46.019
T_1,
and I have some new material,

00:36:46.019 --> 00:36:49.809
lead, and I want to find its
specific heat.

00:36:49.809 --> 00:36:53.469
So, I take the lead in the form
of pellets and I heat the lead

00:36:53.469 --> 00:36:56.530
pellets to some temperature
T_2,

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:01.059
and I drop these guys into this
water.

00:37:01.059 --> 00:37:03.752
That'd be an example where
initially, the lead is in

00:37:03.752 --> 00:37:06.180
equilibrium, maybe on a furnace,
at temperature

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.577
T_2;
water's in equilibrium,

00:37:08.577 --> 00:37:10.075
maybe in the room,
at temperature

00:37:10.075 --> 00:37:12.496
T_1.
Then, I put the pellets into

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:15.275
the water, and there will be a
period when the temperature is

00:37:15.275 --> 00:37:17.595
not defined.
Then, soon they'll settle down

00:37:17.595 --> 00:37:20.630
to some common temperature
called T_f.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:29.639
We will now postulate--this is
a postulate, or a law.

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:35.019
The total change in Q is
zero.

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:37.688
In other words,
if Q is lost by one body

00:37:37.688 --> 00:37:40.827
and gained by another body;
the loss and the gain must

00:37:40.827 --> 00:37:43.389
equal.
It's a new law.

00:37:43.389 --> 00:37:45.579
You can make up all the new
laws you want.

00:37:45.579 --> 00:37:47.896
You don't know if they're
right, but this is the law you

00:37:47.896 --> 00:37:49.504
first make up.
In that case,

00:37:49.504 --> 00:37:52.739
what can you say in this
particular problem?

00:37:52.739 --> 00:37:55.585
In any of these heat problems,
I urge you to draw the

00:37:55.585 --> 00:37:57.962
following picture.
Here is one temperature,

00:37:57.962 --> 00:38:00.739
here is another temperature,
here is the final one,

00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:03.482
which we don't know,
but we can measure with a

00:38:03.482 --> 00:38:07.983
thermometer and measure it.
Then, you say the mass of the

00:38:07.983 --> 00:38:12.696
water, and specific heat of
water, which is 1 times

00:38:12.696 --> 00:38:16.741
∆T,
which is the final temperature

00:38:16.741 --> 00:38:21.579
minus initial temperature.
Ditto for the lead pellet;

00:38:21.579 --> 00:38:25.193
mass of the lead,
lead has got a symbol Pb,

00:38:25.193 --> 00:38:28.719
times specific heat which I
don't know,

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:34.908
times a change in temperature
which is T_f-

00:38:34.908 --> 00:38:38.739
T_2 = 0.
The sum of all the mc

00:38:38.739 --> 00:38:39.530
∆Ts is zero.

00:38:45.179 --> 00:38:49.030
This is the gain of heat,
of the water.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:51.681
This, if you work it out,
will be a negative number,

00:38:51.681 --> 00:38:54.177
because you can see
T_f is below

00:38:54.177 --> 00:38:56.272
initial T.
This will turn out to be

00:38:56.272 --> 00:38:58.820
negative, and the positive and
negative will add up to zero.

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.707
So, what is it you don't know?
Well, you know the mass of the

00:39:02.707 --> 00:39:03.812
water.
Specifically,

00:39:03.812 --> 00:39:06.177
the water is 1 by definition;
T_f and

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.659
T_1 are
measured by thermometers.

00:39:07.659 --> 00:39:09.680
Mass of lead is for you to
measure;

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.280
these are known;
you can find c.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.360
So, this is a birthday present
for you guys.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.165
If you ever see this in an
exam, jump on this first because

00:39:18.165 --> 00:39:20.099
you've been doing this in high
school,

00:39:20.099 --> 00:39:22.830
and I know kids love this kind
of calorimeter problems.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.470
Yes?
Student: Looking at the

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.720
volume in that equation it
expands linearly but wasn't the

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.568
problem with the liquid,
measuring liquid,

00:39:32.568 --> 00:39:35.338
changing volume,
but it didn't expand

00:39:35.338 --> 00:39:37.877
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:39:37.877 --> 00:39:41.269
Shankar: Yes.
That's correct.

00:39:41.269 --> 00:39:43.971
So, the real point is,
if everything expanded

00:39:43.971 --> 00:39:47.656
linearly, we wouldn't have the
disagreement between different

00:39:47.656 --> 00:39:50.130
thermometers.
So, it turns out to an

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:53.184
excellent approximation,
the change of length is

00:39:53.184 --> 00:39:56.239
proportional to the length,
but it's not exactly

00:39:56.239 --> 00:39:59.829
proportional to the length.
There will be terms involving

00:39:59.829 --> 00:40:02.013
higher powers of length.
Not only that,

00:40:02.013 --> 00:40:05.170
specific heated materials is
also not a constant.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:07.159
We said specific heated water
is 1.

00:40:07.159 --> 00:40:10.639
Turns out at a certain
temperature range it'll be 1;

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:12.970
at a different range in fact,
it's not quite 1.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.179
I told you long back.
Everything I tell you is wrong.

00:40:16.179 --> 00:40:18.849
The question is,
"How many decimal places do you

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:21.519
have to go to before you honor
my fallacies?"

00:40:21.519 --> 00:40:23.908
Specific heat of materials is
not a constant,

00:40:23.908 --> 00:40:26.350
with the big industry
calculating the specific

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:29.389
materials starting from atoms
and quantum mechanics.

00:40:29.389 --> 00:40:34.225
So, none of the things treated
as constants are ever constant,

00:40:34.225 --> 00:40:37.000
including those alphas and
betas.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.154
I can always fudge it by saying
α itself may depend on

00:40:40.154 --> 00:40:42.326
the temperature,
and also the dependence on

00:40:42.326 --> 00:40:45.263
L may not be linear.
But you should also look at

00:40:45.263 --> 00:40:48.079
dimensional considerations and
say if it's not L,

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:51.151
if you want to put an
L^(2) as a correction to

00:40:51.151 --> 00:40:54.591
the formula to match the units,
L^(2) has to be divided

00:40:54.591 --> 00:40:56.430
by another length to keep the
units.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.299
What other length do we have?
It may turn out to be the

00:40:59.299 --> 00:41:02.495
inter-atomic spacing.
So, once the atomic properties

00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:05.008
come into play,
then you can find ways to

00:41:05.008 --> 00:41:08.031
calculate corrections.
So, all these laws are,

00:41:08.031 --> 00:41:10.619
in fact, very tentative and
approximate.

00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:12.300
These are pretty ancient
physics.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.890
I think the way I do the
physics course here,

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.010
sometimes I'm in the 1600s,
sometimes in the 1400s,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.860
sometimes in the year 2000,
but going back and forth.

00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:23.420
This is way back when people
did not even know about atoms.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:25.972
So, they were trying to do the
best they can,

00:41:25.972 --> 00:41:29.103
and what you found empirically
is that once you found a

00:41:29.103 --> 00:41:32.014
specific heat for lead,
right, you solve for it,

00:41:32.014 --> 00:41:35.039
then you can do another
experiment using that value and

00:41:35.039 --> 00:41:37.280
you find if you use the right
values,

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.155
∆Q does add up to zero.
Again, when it adds up to zero,

00:41:41.155 --> 00:41:43.543
it adds up to zero to a very
good approximation,

00:41:43.543 --> 00:41:46.085
during the epoch.
Another epoch when people do

00:41:46.085 --> 00:41:48.974
more and more accurate
experiments, everything is shot

00:41:48.974 --> 00:41:51.682
down.
In fact, specific heats of all

00:41:51.682 --> 00:41:55.773
materials seem to go to zero
when you approach absolute

00:41:55.773 --> 00:41:58.533
temperature.
But you have to understand the

00:41:58.533 --> 00:42:01.239
laws of quantum physics to know
why that happens.

00:42:01.239 --> 00:42:05.811
So, this is in a period when
people are probing temperature

00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:09.199
ranges which are around room
temperature,

00:42:09.199 --> 00:42:12.000
or boiling or freezing point of
water, which is a very narrow

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.277
window in temperature.
If you look at the history of

00:42:14.277 --> 00:42:15.833
the universe,
you've got incredibly high

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:18.672
temperatures near the Big Bang,
and even now the rest of the

00:42:18.672 --> 00:42:21.636
universe is bathed at some
temperature that happens to be

00:42:21.636 --> 00:42:23.662
very,
very low, which is near three

00:42:23.662 --> 00:42:25.566
degrees;
it's called a blackbody

00:42:25.566 --> 00:42:28.583
radiation from the Big Bang.
So, the temperature of the

00:42:28.583 --> 00:42:31.309
universe goes through huge
ranges, and only when you probe

00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:33.510
different ranges you see
different physics.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:36.423
If you come to Sloan Lab,
you can go to temperatures way

00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:39.019
below 1 degree Kelvin or
hundredth of a Kelvin,

00:42:39.019 --> 00:42:43.167
and we heard a talk last year,
physics at one billionth of a

00:42:43.167 --> 00:42:45.452
Kelvin.
If you want to cool them and

00:42:45.452 --> 00:42:48.168
cool them and cool them,
by zero degree Kelvin,

00:42:48.168 --> 00:42:50.805
see, there I go.
Zero Kelvin is a barrier we're

00:42:50.805 --> 00:42:53.279
not able to cross,
just like the velocity of light

00:42:53.279 --> 00:42:55.300
is something we're not able to
cross.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.679
These are all big surprises.
The fact that velocity has an

00:42:59.679 --> 00:43:01.970
upper limit, not obvious even to
Newton.

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:04.305
Why not?
Why not put rockets on top of

00:43:04.305 --> 00:43:06.537
rockets?
Likewise, why not build better

00:43:06.537 --> 00:43:09.888
and better refrigerators?
The reason you cannot go below

00:43:09.888 --> 00:43:13.342
zero is when you go to zero,
all the mechanical attributes

00:43:13.342 --> 00:43:16.369
of pressure simply vanish,
and they cannot have negative

00:43:16.369 --> 00:43:18.261
values.
You will see more about this

00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:20.630
when you understand heat in
greater depth.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.810
Anyway, right now,
∆Q = 0 is the rule you

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.438
use.
I'm sure you guys know how to

00:43:25.438 --> 00:43:27.901
do these problems.
Now, there's a little twist

00:43:27.901 --> 00:43:30.591
that comes in,
I just want to mention that to

00:43:30.591 --> 00:43:33.489
you.
The twist is the following.

00:43:33.489 --> 00:43:37.411
So, I take some ice--ice,
by the way, is not always at

00:43:37.411 --> 00:43:38.900
zero.
You know, you can go below zero.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.580
Your refrigerator is several
degrees below several tens below

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.772
zero.
So, let's take ice,

00:43:44.772 --> 00:43:50.340
and let me measure--I take this
container, I put some ice at,

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:55.809
say, minus 30 degrees.
I've gone to centigrade now so

00:43:55.809 --> 00:44:00.231
we can relate to ice.
And I put it on some source of

00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:03.820
heat, and I watch how many
calories are coming in.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.840
Let me arrange a device that
will pump in a fixed number of

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.611
calories every second.
So, as a function of time,

00:44:09.611 --> 00:44:12.420
I'm expecting the temperature
of this to go up.

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:16.212
Do you understand that?
In every second,

00:44:16.212 --> 00:44:20.499
I get some number of calories,
and those number of calories

00:44:20.499 --> 00:44:23.900
are going to produce for me
mc ∆T,

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.271
m and c are
constants, so ∆Q is

00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:30.735
proportional to ∆T.
But if you divide both by the

00:44:30.735 --> 00:44:32.826
time elapsed,
then the rate at which the

00:44:32.826 --> 00:44:35.883
temperature rises will be the
rate at which the heat flows

00:44:35.883 --> 00:44:38.710
into the system.
If heat is flowing at a steady

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:41.599
rate, temperature should rise,
and indeed it does.

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:46.521
Temperature of the ice goes
from minus 30 to minus 20 to

00:44:46.521 --> 00:44:50.659
minus 10 and so on.
But once it hits zero,

00:44:50.659 --> 00:44:54.181
it gets stuck.
I know heat is coming in,

00:44:54.181 --> 00:44:58.833
but it's not getting hotter.
But I notice that the ice is

00:44:58.833 --> 00:45:02.767
beginning to melt.
There will be a period between

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:06.897
here and here when I pump in
calories, I don't get any

00:45:06.897 --> 00:45:11.182
increase in temperature but I
get conversion of ice into

00:45:11.182 --> 00:45:13.656
water.
And there will be a period when

00:45:13.656 --> 00:45:16.890
this guy looks like some water
with some chunks of ice floating

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:17.360
on it.

00:45:20.619 --> 00:45:24.816
And until all the ice is
converted to water,

00:45:24.816 --> 00:45:29.500
the whole system is stuck at
that temperature.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.780
That's a very interesting
property.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.868
Now, if you really took a real
pot and you put a chunk of ice

00:45:33.868 --> 00:45:36.030
on it, you know what will
happen, right?

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:38.409
The bottom of the ice will melt;
it may even evaporate.

00:45:38.409 --> 00:45:40.894
That's not what I'm talking
about, because that's not a

00:45:40.894 --> 00:45:43.380
system where there's a globally
defined temperature.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.104
I want you to heat the ice so
slowly, the minute you put a

00:45:46.104 --> 00:45:48.972
little bit of calories,
give it enough time for all

00:45:48.972 --> 00:45:52.565
these guys to share that heat,
so that the whole system has

00:45:52.565 --> 00:45:56.270
one single common temperature.
Let's watch the temperature

00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:58.034
rise.
I'm saying it gets stuck at

00:45:58.034 --> 00:46:00.670
zero, but your calories are
getting you something;

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.929
they're converting ice into
water.

00:46:02.929 --> 00:46:05.570
Then you can ask,
okay, what penalty do I have to

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:08.099
pay, that's called a latent heat
of melting,

00:46:08.099 --> 00:46:10.993
and again, I know only in
calories per gram,

00:46:10.993 --> 00:46:13.550
it's 80 calories per gram for
water.

00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:20.706
Some of your ∆Q now
goes not to raise the

00:46:20.706 --> 00:46:25.259
temperature, but to melt that
amount of stuff at the latent

00:46:25.259 --> 00:46:28.944
heat of melting.
That's how much Q you

00:46:28.944 --> 00:46:33.174
need to melt that amount of
stuff and the L varies

00:46:33.174 --> 00:46:37.404
from substance to substance,
but water is 80 calories per

00:46:37.404 --> 00:46:39.606
gram.
If you want to melt mercury

00:46:39.606 --> 00:46:42.338
from solid mercury to liquid
mercury, it will have a

00:46:42.338 --> 00:46:46.989
different number.
Then, once everybody has become

00:46:46.989 --> 00:46:53.570
water, then that uniform system
of water starts growing.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:56.090
And this is called a phase
change.

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:59.467
A phase change is when it
changes its atomic arrangement

00:46:59.467 --> 00:47:01.782
from a regular array;
for example,

00:47:01.782 --> 00:47:04.340
that forms a solid into a
liquid.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.190
In a solid, everybody has its
place;

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.945
you can shake around where you
are, but liquid you can run

00:47:08.945 --> 00:47:11.698
around.
The specific heat of ice is not

00:47:11.698 --> 00:47:16.037
the same as the specific heat of
water, so you've got to be

00:47:16.037 --> 00:47:18.413
careful.
Even though it's still made up

00:47:18.413 --> 00:47:21.003
of water molecules,
the calories needed to heat one

00:47:21.003 --> 00:47:24.110
gram of ice is roughly half what
it takes to heat one gram of

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:25.995
water.
So, in these problems,

00:47:25.995 --> 00:47:28.868
don't make the mistake.
Okay then, you go along and I

00:47:28.868 --> 00:47:31.250
guess you know what the next
stopping point is.

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:35.001
When you come to 100 degrees,
again, it gets stuck until

00:47:35.001 --> 00:47:38.139
everybody vaporizes,
and then you get steam.

00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:41.952
Then, you can have super-heated
steam, which is at even higher

00:47:41.952 --> 00:47:44.563
than 100 degrees.
So, that's the latent heat of

00:47:44.563 --> 00:47:46.892
vaporization.
I really don't know what--you

00:47:46.892 --> 00:47:49.950
want to write something,
I think it's 500 and something

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:52.575
calories per gram.
That's information I don't

00:47:52.575 --> 00:47:53.570
carry in my head.

00:47:57.659 --> 00:48:02.532
So, if I tell you I took some
ice at minus 30 and I dumped in

00:48:02.532 --> 00:48:05.699
5,000 calories,
where will it end up?

00:48:05.699 --> 00:48:08.495
You've got to first spend a few
calories going from here to

00:48:08.495 --> 00:48:11.579
here, you got some more money
left you can start melting this,

00:48:11.579 --> 00:48:14.544
maybe you'll run out of stuff
there, and that's what you will

00:48:14.544 --> 00:48:16.643
have.
Some amount of water and some

00:48:16.643 --> 00:48:19.153
amount of ice.
If you have even more calories

00:48:19.153 --> 00:48:21.611
at your disposal,
you can melt it all and start

00:48:21.611 --> 00:48:23.738
heating it.
You may come this way and you

00:48:23.738 --> 00:48:26.693
may be running out of calories;
if not, keep going here and

00:48:26.693 --> 00:48:29.188
there and there,
and you may end up there if you

00:48:29.188 --> 00:48:32.136
got enough calories.
Or one can ask a question,

00:48:32.136 --> 00:48:36.188
"How many calories does it take
to convert ice at minus 30 to,

00:48:36.188 --> 00:48:39.406
say, water at 100?"
You'll have to do the mc

00:48:39.406 --> 00:48:42.529
∆T for that,
m times latent heat for

00:48:42.529 --> 00:48:44.261
this,
mc ∆T for that,

00:48:44.261 --> 00:48:47.140
and m times latent heat
of vaporization for that.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.839
So, the kind of problems you
can get are fairly simple most

00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:57.504
of the time.
Only kind of problem where you

00:48:57.504 --> 00:49:00.020
can really get in trouble is the
following.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.845
I will mention that to you.
Suppose I take some water and

00:49:04.845 --> 00:49:08.909
some ice, so this is zero.
The ice is at,

00:49:08.909 --> 00:49:13.510
say, minus 40,
the water is at plus 80.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:16.219
In fact, let me make that water
plus 40.

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:20.390
I bring them together and I ask
you what will happen.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:26.322
Now, this is a subtle problem.
If you had two--If you had

00:49:26.322 --> 00:49:30.410
water at 40 and you had water at
20, you can easily guess that

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:32.890
it'll end up somewhere in
between;

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:36.030
you can calculate it.
Now it's more subtle.

00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:38.957
You've got water at 40,
you've got ice at minus 40,

00:49:38.957 --> 00:49:41.710
you bring them together and ask
what happens.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.940
Well, the answer will depend on
how much of the stuff you have.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:47.714
If by water at 40 you mean the
Atlantic Ocean,

00:49:47.714 --> 00:49:51.536
and by ice you mean a couple of
ice cubes, we know what's going

00:49:51.536 --> 00:49:53.472
to happen.
These guys are going to get

00:49:53.472 --> 00:49:54.810
clobbered;
they're going to melt;

00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:58.467
you will end up somewhere here.
Then, you can easily calculate

00:49:58.467 --> 00:50:02.390
the final temperature by saying
mc times this ∆T

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:04.239
for water,
in magnitude,

00:50:04.239 --> 00:50:07.360
is going to be the heat given
to this.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.199
Heat given to this is the mc
∆T to come here;

00:50:10.199 --> 00:50:12.609
then, the heat to melt this
amount of ice,

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:15.899
then the heat to raise this
amount of water to that final

00:50:15.899 --> 00:50:18.160
temperature.
Then, you can solve for the

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.074
final temperature.
So, if you want to solve this

00:50:21.074 --> 00:50:24.360
problem, and I give you some
mass for this ice,

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.116
of water, and I give you some
mass for the ice,

00:50:27.116 --> 00:50:30.232
you can first make the
optimistic assumption that you

00:50:30.232 --> 00:50:33.760
will end up as water,
but at an unknown temperature.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.650
We call the unknown temperature
T;

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:36.595
this is the
T_1,

00:50:36.595 --> 00:50:37.630
this is the
T_2.

00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:40.565
Write your equations,
except you'll have one more

00:50:40.565 --> 00:50:42.729
term there.
That's the heat it takes to

00:50:42.729 --> 00:50:45.110
melt the ice.
You solve for T.

00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:47.710
If you get a positive answer
you can use it,

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:51.219
because the assumption that you
ended up on water meant you

00:50:51.219 --> 00:50:54.328
heated up the ice,
you melted the ice into water,

00:50:54.328 --> 00:50:57.590
then heated up the water from
zero to the final water.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.566
But if you did the calculation
and got a negative value of

00:51:00.566 --> 00:51:03.019
T, that answer cannot be
blindly used,

00:51:03.019 --> 00:51:06.235
because the assumption that you
are on the other side of ice is

00:51:06.235 --> 00:51:08.392
wrong.
Then, you can try something

00:51:08.392 --> 00:51:11.269
else;
you can assume you're down here.

00:51:11.269 --> 00:51:16.558
If you think you're down here,
then you've simply heated the

00:51:16.558 --> 00:51:20.590
ice from here to here.
This water you brought down to

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:24.538
zero, sucked out mc ∆T
from that, then you've taken out

00:51:24.538 --> 00:51:28.349
now the latent heat of melting.
You take out heat when you

00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:32.159
freeze, and then you've taken
even more to come down here.

00:51:32.159 --> 00:51:35.208
Then, all those losses of the
original water is equal to the

00:51:35.208 --> 00:51:37.229
gain of this ice.
You can assume it here,

00:51:37.229 --> 00:51:38.719
you can solve for this
T.

00:51:38.719 --> 00:51:40.960
When you solve for this
T, if you've got a

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.639
negative number,
then you're okay.

00:51:42.639 --> 00:51:45.755
That will be a good assumption
if I say I sprinkled two drops

00:51:45.755 --> 00:51:48.858
of water on a big iceberg;
we know it's going to end up as

00:51:48.858 --> 00:51:50.880
ice and that's a good starting
point.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.740
But if I give you numbers which
are kind of wishy-washy,

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.705
where I don't know whether this
will win or that will win,

00:51:56.705 --> 00:52:00.941
there's a third possibility.
The third possibility is at the

00:52:00.941 --> 00:52:04.259
end of the day,
you end up here with some

00:52:04.259 --> 00:52:09.070
amount of water and some amount
of ice at zero degrees.

00:52:09.070 --> 00:52:11.238
So, that's a third option you
may have to consider,

00:52:11.238 --> 00:52:12.410
if neither of them works.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.710
Then, the question is not what
is the final temperature.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:23.160
But what's the question then?
What do you want to know in

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.769
that case?
How much is ice and how much is

00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:28.739
water?
That's the question.

00:52:28.739 --> 00:52:32.280
And there are several ways to
figure that out.

00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.003
Let me just say in words,
I don't want to do this algebra

00:52:35.003 --> 00:52:37.289
because for you guys it would be
fairly easy.

00:52:37.289 --> 00:52:41.460
If it's a question of--Suppose
both of the things I try fail.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.244
I took a positive T,
assumed I'm up here,

00:52:44.244 --> 00:52:47.740
and I assume the ice melted,
and I get a negative answer;

00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:49.956
that's shot down.
I take a negative T and

00:52:49.956 --> 00:52:51.989
assume everybody froze and that
doesn't work.

00:52:51.989 --> 00:52:54.982
Then, I'm down to this option,
which is some amount of water

00:52:54.982 --> 00:52:57.195
and some amount of ice.
And the question is,

00:52:57.195 --> 00:53:00.207
"How much is left?"
You solve that by doing the

00:53:00.207 --> 00:53:04.356
following.
You say all this ice went from

00:53:04.356 --> 00:53:08.964
here to there.
It does that by absorbing that

00:53:08.964 --> 00:53:12.330
mc ∆T;
mass of the ice times specific

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.482
heat of ice times ∆T.
Maybe it was minus 40,

00:53:15.482 --> 00:53:20.050
the ∆T is plus 40.
You give that heat to this guy;

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:21.840
that heat you suck,
out of this guy.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.191
When you suck that out of this
guy, first you bring this to

00:53:25.191 --> 00:53:28.657
zero, then you still have some
more heat you can extract from

00:53:28.657 --> 00:53:31.218
him,
you will use that to convert

00:53:31.218 --> 00:53:35.190
water into ice at the price of
80 calories per gram.

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:39.440
Maybe you can freeze 5 grams or
5 kilograms of water;

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:43.192
that will be the extra ice,
the rest will be the water you

00:53:43.192 --> 00:53:45.971
started with.
The total mass will be the

00:53:45.971 --> 00:53:50.382
same, but if you got 60 grams of
water, you bring the 60 grams to

00:53:50.382 --> 00:53:54.380
zero and you still have some
more heat to be extracted;

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.001
maybe you'll convert 10 grams
to ice and 50 will remain as

00:53:58.001 --> 00:54:00.513
water.
So, the final answer will be 50

00:54:00.513 --> 00:54:03.357
grams of water,
10 grams of ice plus whatever

00:54:03.357 --> 00:54:08.986
grams of ice you started with.
That's about the most complex

00:54:08.986 --> 00:54:14.147
heat-exchange problem.
If you guys want me to tell you

00:54:14.147 --> 00:54:16.920
some more I will,
or I can move on.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.449
I don't know what your view on
this is.

00:54:19.449 --> 00:54:23.100
Do you understand what you have
to do in each problem?

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.985
Okay.
So, it's the conservation of

00:54:25.985 --> 00:54:29.118
heat that's applied.
So, the most tricky part is

00:54:29.118 --> 00:54:31.967
phase change,
when you've got a phase change,

00:54:31.967 --> 00:54:34.816
you've got to remember that the
formula mc

00:54:34.816 --> 00:54:37.730
∆T--∆Q has one
more term,

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:38.830
the one more term is this.

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:52.152
Okay, so next question we ask
is, "What's the manner in which

00:54:52.152 --> 00:54:56.019
heat manages to flow?"
We say you got these calories,

00:54:56.019 --> 00:54:58.969
I mean, how does it flow,
what's the rate at--what makes

00:54:58.969 --> 00:55:01.359
it flow.
So, it turns out there are

00:55:01.359 --> 00:55:03.920
three popular ways of heat
transfer;

00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.630
one is called radiation.

00:55:10.369 --> 00:55:15.280
Radiation is when the heat
energy leaves some hot body and

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:19.243
comes to you without the benefit
of any medium,

00:55:19.243 --> 00:55:22.879
like heat from the Sun.
So, that's really

00:55:22.879 --> 00:55:26.346
electromagnetic radiation that
comes from hot,

00:55:26.346 --> 00:55:29.889
glowing objects,
and directly comes to you.

00:55:29.889 --> 00:55:32.117
Electromagnetic radiation
doesn't need air,

00:55:32.117 --> 00:55:34.721
doesn't need anything.
In fact, if it needed air,

00:55:34.721 --> 00:55:37.641
we would not get any heat from
the Sun because there is no

00:55:37.641 --> 00:55:39.690
medium between the Earth and the
Sun.

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:43.234
Most of it is just vacuum.
So, if you took one of these

00:55:43.234 --> 00:55:45.925
space heaters,
you know, with glowing red

00:55:45.925 --> 00:55:50.347
coils, and you feel warm.
If I start pumping the air out

00:55:50.347 --> 00:55:53.816
of that room,
of course, you will be dying

00:55:53.816 --> 00:55:57.015
very rapidly,
but your last thoughts will be,

00:55:57.015 --> 00:56:00.527
"I am still warm" [laughter]
because the radiation will keep

00:56:00.527 --> 00:56:02.700
coming to you.
Okay?

00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:06.303
That's radiation heat.
There are lots of laws for

00:56:06.303 --> 00:56:07.922
radiation;
I don't want to give them to

00:56:07.922 --> 00:56:09.645
you because there are formulas
you memorize,

00:56:09.645 --> 00:56:12.130
and you don't understand too
much of the physics right now.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:14.686
Other than to say it's
electromagnetic radiation,

00:56:14.686 --> 00:56:17.510
whatever that means--we haven't
gotten to that yet.

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:20.280
That's what comes from there to
here and can come in vacuum.

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.880
It doesn't need a medium,
is the key.

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.680
Then, the second way of heat
transfer is called convection.

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:33.120
So, convection is explained by
the following example.

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.840
You've got water;
you put it on a hot plate.

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:40.380
Then, in the lower part of it,
the water gets hot.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:44.426
When it gets hot it expands,
and when it expands the density

00:56:44.426 --> 00:56:47.858
goes down;
therefore, by loss of buoyancy

00:56:47.858 --> 00:56:52.259
it will start raising up.
Remember, a chunk of water

00:56:52.259 --> 00:56:55.065
belongs in water.
A chunk of something else with

00:56:55.065 --> 00:56:56.699
lower density will float to the
top.

00:56:56.699 --> 00:56:59.158
But the point is,
water doesn't have a fixed

00:56:59.158 --> 00:57:00.627
density.
If you heat it up,

00:57:00.627 --> 00:57:03.120
the density goes down,
so the water guys downstairs

00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.564
have lower density-- they're
like a piece of cork,

00:57:05.564 --> 00:57:08.849
they will rise to the top.
When they rise to the top,

00:57:08.849 --> 00:57:12.530
the cold water with the higher
density will fall down.

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:16.560
So, you set up a current.
Hot rises to the top and cold

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.110
comes down.
And this also happens in the

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:20.423
atmosphere.
On a hot day,

00:57:20.423 --> 00:57:23.725
the air next to the ground gets
really heated up and it rises,

00:57:23.725 --> 00:57:26.702
and the cold air comes down and
you set up these thermal

00:57:26.702 --> 00:57:28.918
currents.
So, here you're trying to

00:57:28.918 --> 00:57:32.420
equalize the temperature between
a region which is cold and a

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:35.980
region which is hot by the
actual motion of some material.

00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:39.202
In radiation,
you don't have the medium

00:57:39.202 --> 00:57:43.952
transferring heat because a
medium is not even present in

00:57:43.952 --> 00:57:46.038
radiation.
In convection,

00:57:46.038 --> 00:57:49.253
the medium actually moves.
The hot guys physically move to

00:57:49.253 --> 00:57:51.312
the other place and the cold
guys come here,

00:57:51.312 --> 00:57:53.610
and by that process,
the heat is transferred.

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:57.572
The heat transfer I want to
focus on a little more

00:57:57.572 --> 00:58:00.160
quantitatively,
is conduction.

00:58:07.559 --> 00:58:09.937
So, heat conduction is
something you've all

00:58:09.937 --> 00:58:12.136
experienced.
I mean, if you have a skillet,

00:58:12.136 --> 00:58:13.730
why does it have a wooden
handle?

00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:16.967
Simple reason;
if you had a steel handle,

00:58:16.967 --> 00:58:21.780
you put it on a hot stove and
you put your hand here,

00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:24.709
the fact that your body is at
whatever, 98 degrees,

00:58:24.709 --> 00:58:27.091
and this one is God knows,
200 degrees,

00:58:27.091 --> 00:58:30.179
you're going to have heat flow
from here to here.

00:58:30.179 --> 00:58:33.124
So, we want to understand
what's the rate at which heat

00:58:33.124 --> 00:58:35.360
flows from the hot end to the
cold end.

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.905
So, you can imagine a rod of
some cross-section A,

00:58:38.905 --> 00:58:42.577
one end of the rod is in some
reservoir at some temperature

00:58:42.577 --> 00:58:45.405
T_1,
other end is at temperature

00:58:45.405 --> 00:58:48.352
T_2.
By the way, I'm now introducing

00:58:48.352 --> 00:58:51.963
a new term called reservoir.
Reservoir is another body like

00:58:51.963 --> 00:58:54.670
you and me, except it's not like
you and me.

00:58:54.670 --> 00:58:57.079
It's enormous.
It is so big that its

00:58:57.079 --> 00:59:00.251
temperature cannot be changed.
You can sit on it,

00:59:00.251 --> 00:59:03.290
you will fry and you'll
evaporate, but its temperature

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:06.820
will not change.
No body is really a reservoir.

00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:09.694
If you drop an ice cube in the
Atlantic, you'll lower the

00:59:09.694 --> 00:59:12.619
temperature of the Atlantic but
by a negligible amount.

00:59:12.619 --> 00:59:15.082
So, take the limit of Atlantic
goes to infinity,

00:59:15.082 --> 00:59:18.181
then you have a reservoir.
Reservoirs have one label,

00:59:18.181 --> 00:59:21.794
namely, what's our temperature.
So, something big enough can

00:59:21.794 --> 00:59:23.800
be--this room is like a
reservoir.

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.906
You put a cup of coffee here,
you say it will come to room

00:59:26.906 --> 00:59:29.294
temperature.
Actually, the room temperature

00:59:29.294 --> 00:59:31.840
meets the coffee,
not halfway but slightly up.

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:35.181
But the room is large enough so
that we can attribute to the

00:59:35.181 --> 00:59:38.240
room temperature quite
independent of bodies that go in

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.282
and out of it.
So, this is connected on the

00:59:41.282 --> 00:59:45.254
left to an enormous tank of
maybe a water-ice mixture at

00:59:45.254 --> 00:59:48.132
zero degrees;
this is a water-steam mixture

00:59:48.132 --> 00:59:50.880
at maybe 100 degrees.
You put a rod there.

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:53.184
We know heat is going to flow
from the hot body,

00:59:53.184 --> 00:59:54.900
from the hot end to the cold
end.

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:59.658
And we want to write a formula
for how much heat flows per

00:59:59.658 --> 01:00:02.686
second.
Again, I'm going to write these

01:00:02.686 --> 01:00:06.423
formulas over and over again.
So, you've got to ask yourself,

01:00:06.423 --> 01:00:09.506
what will it depend on?
What are the properties it will

01:00:09.506 --> 01:00:12.687
depend on, in general,
independent of what the rod is

01:00:12.687 --> 01:00:15.580
made of?
Can you think of one?

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.493
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

01:00:17.493 --> 01:00:19.415
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: You said the

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:22.024
cross-section.
Now, why do we say--what reason

01:00:22.024 --> 01:00:25.483
can you give for cross--
Student: If you just want

01:00:25.483 --> 01:00:28.880
to consider a rod with twice the
cross-section area,

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.056
you're going to come up with
[inaudible]

01:00:31.056 --> 01:00:33.958
two rods and twice [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:00:33.958 --> 01:00:36.047
Shankar: Yes,
okay let me look at this

01:00:36.047 --> 01:00:37.330
argument.
You take one rod,

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:40.719
and for convenience let's just
take it to be a rectangular rod.

01:00:40.719 --> 01:00:43.280
Take another rod,
rectangular rod;

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.708
they will both transfer the
same amount of heat for a given

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:48.292
amount of time.
Just glue them together and say

01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:51.375
here is my new rod.
We know it's going to transmit

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:54.478
twice the amount of heat.
So, it's going to be

01:00:54.478 --> 01:00:58.829
proportional to the area.
And why is the heat flowing?

01:00:58.829 --> 01:01:00.970
It's flowing because of a
temperature difference.

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:04.328
So, that's always there;
that's the underlying force for

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:06.351
heat transfer.
That's the dynamics in

01:01:06.351 --> 01:01:08.769
thermodynamics;
that's what makes the heat flow.

01:01:08.769 --> 01:01:12.915
But then, we find as an
empirical fact,

01:01:12.915 --> 01:01:19.679
that if these two reservoirs
are separated by that distance,

01:01:19.679 --> 01:01:22.730
then the heat flow is a lot
less than when they are closer.

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:26.989
It seems to depend on how much
temperature difference is packed

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:30.246
in spatially.
So, you want to divide by a

01:01:30.246 --> 01:01:33.050
∆x is not
infinitesimal;

01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:36.636
it's the length of the rod
separating the hot and cold

01:01:36.636 --> 01:01:37.873
ends.
In other words,

01:01:37.873 --> 01:01:40.624
if you dilute the temperature
difference over one mile,

01:01:40.624 --> 01:01:43.119
the heat flow will be
correspondingly reduced,

01:01:43.119 --> 01:01:45.553
whereas if there's huge
temperature difference between a

01:01:45.553 --> 01:01:48.631
very small spatial separation,
there will be very robust flow

01:01:48.631 --> 01:01:50.230
of heat;
that's what we're saying.

01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:52.364
These happen to be true,
you realize,

01:01:52.364 --> 01:01:55.269
independent of what material
I'm talking about.

01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:57.867
When I said one rod plus one
rod is two rods,

01:01:57.867 --> 01:02:00.110
it doesn't matter what it's
made of.

01:02:00.110 --> 01:02:03.458
Again, having put all these
factors which you can argue on

01:02:03.458 --> 01:02:05.750
general grounds,
you have to now ask,

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:09.030
"What happens when this is a
copper rod versus silver rod

01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:11.691
versus wooden rod?"
So, you've got to put one more

01:02:11.691 --> 01:02:13.218
number which is kappa
[κ]

01:02:13.218 --> 01:02:15.346
here;
not k you guys,

01:02:15.346 --> 01:02:18.680
it's κ,
and it's called the thermal

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.300
conductivity of that material.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:33.078
Sometimes you put a minus sign;
minus sign just means it flows

01:02:33.078 --> 01:02:35.988
from hot to cold.
I don't care whether you put

01:02:35.988 --> 01:02:38.690
the plus sign or don't put the
minus sign;

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:42.380
anybody knows that the heat is
going to flow from hot to cold.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.686
So, just remember that
direction of flow,

01:02:44.686 --> 01:02:47.340
and that's all I care about,
this sign here.

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:49.429
This κ is the property
of the material.

01:02:49.429 --> 01:02:52.865
Once again, let me tell
you--You can say,

01:02:52.865 --> 01:02:56.730
"Well, I have two reservoirs,
hot and cold.

01:02:56.730 --> 01:02:58.340
I connected them with two
different rods.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:03.327
This rod carried twice the
amount of heat per second as the

01:03:03.327 --> 01:03:05.365
other rod.
Is it necessarily a better

01:03:05.365 --> 01:03:06.670
conductor?"
No.

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:08.809
Maybe it had 10,000 times the
cross-section.

01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:12.244
So, what you want to do is to
make the playing field level,

01:03:12.244 --> 01:03:14.909
and compare rods of the same
cross-section,

01:03:14.909 --> 01:03:17.304
same temperature difference,
same length,

01:03:17.304 --> 01:03:19.340
then ask who conducts more
heat.

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:22.375
That depends on the material
and that's the thing you pulled

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:26.249
out specific to the material.
That is the property of wood or

01:03:26.249 --> 01:03:28.660
copper of steel;
that's the heat conductivity.

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:35.359
Okay.
Now, the final topic is just

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:38.429
going to be more hand-waving
now.

01:03:38.429 --> 01:03:39.769
I don't want to get into too
many details.

01:03:39.769 --> 01:03:41.740
It really has to do with what
is heat.

01:03:45.429 --> 01:03:47.608
In the old days,
people just said that it was a

01:03:47.608 --> 01:03:50.639
fluid, and they postulated the
conservation law for the fluid.

01:03:50.639 --> 01:03:53.131
You can postulate what you
want, you've got to make sure it

01:03:53.131 --> 01:03:55.820
works, and it seems to work,
in the sense that all the

01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:58.340
∆Qs in any reaction add
up to zero.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.788
But then, people are getting
hints that maybe this thing that

01:04:02.788 --> 01:04:07.089
we call heat is not entirely
independent of other things we

01:04:07.089 --> 01:04:10.300
have learned.
So, where do you get the clue?

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.500
One clue is,
long back when we studied

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.070
mechanics, we talked about two
cars that come and collide;

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:20.596
they slam into one big lump.
Now, you've got no kinetic

01:04:20.596 --> 01:04:23.636
energy, no potential energy.
Potential energy is always

01:04:23.636 --> 01:04:26.773
zero, they're moving on the same
height, kinetic energy was ½

01:04:26.773 --> 01:04:29.320
mv^(2) for this,
½ mv^(2) for that;

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.333
at the end there's nothing.
No kinetic, no potential,

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:35.905
we just gave up and said,
"Look, conservation of energy

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:41.440
does not apply to this problem."
We just say it's inelastic.

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.688
On the other hand,
we find whenever that happens,

01:04:45.688 --> 01:04:50.226
we find the bodies become hot.
Here's another thing you can

01:04:50.226 --> 01:04:53.699
do, you can take a cannonball,
drop it from a big tower.

01:04:53.699 --> 01:04:55.733
This is how some people in the
French army, I think,

01:04:55.733 --> 01:04:58.215
first detected this feature;
you dropped cannonballs from a

01:04:58.215 --> 01:04:59.869
big height.
When they hit the sand,

01:04:59.869 --> 01:05:02.513
they start heating up.
Or you drill a hole in a

01:05:02.513 --> 01:05:04.894
cannon, that's what
Count-somebody did,

01:05:04.894 --> 01:05:08.653
and he also noticed that you
need to constantly pour water to

01:05:08.653 --> 01:05:11.159
keep the drill bit from heating
up.

01:05:11.159 --> 01:05:15.900
You'll find very often,
mechanical energy is lost and

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.629
things heat up.
So, you get a suspicion

01:05:18.629 --> 01:05:21.398
whatever the underlying
mechanism, maybe there's a rule

01:05:21.398 --> 01:05:24.219
that says if you lose so much
mechanical energy that you

01:05:24.219 --> 01:05:27.401
cannot account for,
then it translates into a fixed

01:05:27.401 --> 01:05:30.547
number of calories.
If that is the case,

01:05:30.547 --> 01:05:35.548
then we at least get a
dictionary on--between calories

01:05:35.548 --> 01:05:39.208
and joules.
So, joules is energy you can

01:05:39.208 --> 01:05:42.550
see, calories is energy you
cannot see.

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:43.949
That was going to be the
premise.

01:05:43.949 --> 01:05:46.460
But first, you've got to prove
that every time you lose some

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.246
number of joules,
you get a fixed amount of

01:05:48.246 --> 01:05:51.208
calories.
And that experiment is due to

01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:56.090
Joule.
Here is the Joule experiment.

01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:58.820
It's very, very simple and
tells you the whole story.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:04.429
You have a little container in
which there is a paddle.

01:06:04.429 --> 01:06:10.210
This is a shaft with a pulley,
and there is a weight here.

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:13.030
So look, try to imagine this
guys.

01:06:13.030 --> 01:06:16.502
You got rope wrapped around the
top pulley, and when you let

01:06:16.502 --> 01:06:19.210
this weight go down,
it's going to go down like

01:06:19.210 --> 01:06:21.280
this;
it's going to spin the shaft.

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:24.515
And put some water here,
and I have some fins that are

01:06:24.515 --> 01:06:27.139
sticking out,
so they churn up the water.

01:06:27.139 --> 01:06:31.031
So, it's like this thing,
the egg-beater,

01:06:31.031 --> 01:06:32.992
right?
In fact, I tried to do the

01:06:32.992 --> 01:06:35.677
experiment with an egg-beater
this summer to a bunch of high

01:06:35.677 --> 01:06:38.571
school kids,
and I got thoroughly humiliated

01:06:38.571 --> 01:06:41.210
because nothing happened as
planned.

01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:44.545
But the idea is the same.
You agitate the water in some

01:06:44.545 --> 01:06:46.254
fashion.
But this guy did it in a

01:06:46.254 --> 01:06:49.024
particularly simple way.
My egg beating was not good

01:06:49.024 --> 01:06:50.572
enough;
you will see maybe in a while

01:06:50.572 --> 01:06:53.298
why that's not good.
What he did was to put these

01:06:53.298 --> 01:06:56.880
paddles, let the weight go down
from there to here.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:07:02.094
Now, we can keep track of how
much mechanical energy is lost,

01:07:02.094 --> 01:07:04.335
right?
Because if this mass was at

01:07:04.335 --> 01:07:07.197
rest, and a drop to height
mg drop to height

01:07:07.197 --> 01:07:10.690
h, it's supposed to have
mgh kinetic energy.

01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:14.536
Let's say it's got some kinetic
energy, which is not equal to

01:07:14.536 --> 01:07:17.711
mgh.
So, mgh minus kinetic

01:07:17.711 --> 01:07:22.183
energy is missing.
So, some number of joules are

01:07:22.183 --> 01:07:25.090
gone.
So, the water gets hot.

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:28.725
When the water gets hot,
you can immediately ask how

01:07:28.725 --> 01:07:31.789
many calories were supplied to
the water.

01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:35.482
Because that water heats up the
same way whether or not you put

01:07:35.482 --> 01:07:38.519
it on a hotplate,
or whether or not you churn it.

01:07:38.519 --> 01:07:40.470
It doesn't seem to depend on
how it got hot.

01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:43.850
This has the same effect.
This water is hot in every real

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:45.843
sense.
So, you must have put some

01:07:45.843 --> 01:07:47.474
calories.
You can find out how many

01:07:47.474 --> 01:07:49.900
calories you put in by looking
at the mass of the water;

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.503
specific heat of the water is 1;
looking at the increase in

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:56.913
temperature.
So, some joules are missing,

01:07:56.913 --> 01:08:01.300
some calories have been pumped
into the water.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.412
Then you ask,
"Is there a proportionality

01:08:03.412 --> 01:08:06.590
between joules and calories?"
And you find that it is.

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:11.610
And that happens to be 4.2
joules per calorie.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:20.682
In other words,
if you can expend 4.2 joules of

01:08:20.682 --> 01:08:24.999
mechanical energy,
you got yourself one calorie to

01:08:24.999 --> 01:08:28.699
be used for whatever heating
purposes.

01:08:28.699 --> 01:08:30.604
So, in the example of the
colliding cars,

01:08:30.604 --> 01:08:32.604
this had some energy,
that had some energy,

01:08:32.604 --> 01:08:34.861
all measured in joules;
they slammed together,

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:37.490
they come to rest.
That means you can take those

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:41.380
many joules, divide it by 4.2
and get some number of calories.

01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.000
Imagine the whole car is made
out of copper.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.974
Then those calories will
produce an increase in

01:08:46.974 --> 01:08:50.079
temperature, right,
equal to ∆Q is mc

01:08:50.079 --> 01:08:52.284
∆T.
That will be the rise in

01:08:52.284 --> 01:08:54.202
temperature of the car.
In practice,

01:08:54.202 --> 01:08:56.731
there will be other losses,
because you heard the sound,

01:08:56.731 --> 01:08:59.199
well, that's some energy gone;
you won't get it back.

01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:01.400
Maybe some sparks are flying,
that's light energy;

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:03.948
that's gone.
You subtract all that out,

01:09:03.948 --> 01:09:07.357
you find that in the end,
the calories explain the

01:09:07.357 --> 01:09:11.445
missing joules.
So, that made people think that

01:09:11.445 --> 01:09:14.829
this is just another form of
energy.

01:09:14.829 --> 01:09:17.940
Because if you add this to your
energy balance,

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:21.524
there is no reason to go on
apologizing for the Law of

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:25.053
Conservation of Energy.
Law of Conservation of Energy

01:09:25.053 --> 01:09:27.697
is not in fact violated,
even at the inelastic

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:30.869
collision, if you include heat
as a form of energy.

01:09:30.869 --> 01:09:34.750
And the conversion factor is
4.2 joules per calorie.

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:38.511
But the question is,
"What right do you have to call

01:09:38.511 --> 01:09:41.001
it energy?"
Energy, we think--primarily,

01:09:41.001 --> 01:09:43.571
when you say somebody's
energetic, you mean that

01:09:43.571 --> 01:09:46.579
someone's running around
mindlessly, back and forth.

01:09:46.579 --> 01:09:48.699
Energy is associated with
motion.

01:09:48.699 --> 01:09:51.654
These two cars were moving,
and we have every right to say

01:09:51.654 --> 01:09:54.590
they have energy.
How about potential energy?

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:57.321
Well, if the car starts
climbing up a hill and slows

01:09:57.321 --> 01:09:59.250
down, we think it's got
potential.

01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.520
If you let it go,
it'll come back and give you

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:03.513
the kinetic energy.
So, most people's idea of

01:10:03.513 --> 01:10:06.300
energy is just kinetic energy.
That is lost.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:10.906
And yet, you get calories in
return, so you ask yourself,

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:13.850
"What can it be?"
Well, the correct answer to

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:16.457
that came only when we
understood that everything is

01:10:16.457 --> 01:10:19.558
made up of atoms.
Once you grant that everything

01:10:19.558 --> 01:10:22.744
is made up of atoms,
then it turns out that the

01:10:22.744 --> 01:10:26.069
kinetic energy of atoms is what
we call heat.

01:10:26.069 --> 01:10:28.990
But you've got to be very
careful.

01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:33.920
Take a tank full of gas.
I throw it at you.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:37.900
That whole tank is moving,
that's not what I call heat.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.829
Okay?
That motion you can see.

01:10:40.829 --> 01:10:43.720
I'm talking about a tank of gas
that doesn't seem to be going

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.929
anywhere;
yet, it got motional energy

01:10:45.929 --> 01:10:49.039
because the little guys are
going back and forth.

01:10:49.039 --> 01:10:53.384
So, what we will find is what
I'm going to show you next time,

01:10:53.384 --> 01:10:57.301
is that if you kept track of
the kinetic energy of every

01:10:57.301 --> 01:11:01.428
single molecule in this car,
every single molecule in that

01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:04.359
car, before and after,
and you added them up,

01:11:04.359 --> 01:11:06.159
you would get exactly the same
number.

01:11:06.159 --> 01:11:11.453
The only difference will be
originally the car has got

01:11:11.453 --> 01:11:15.697
global common velocity;
macroscopic velocity you can

01:11:15.697 --> 01:11:16.729
see.
On top of it,

01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:20.160
it's got random motion of the
molecules that make up the car.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.823
So does the other car.
When they slam together,

01:11:22.823 --> 01:11:24.983
the macroscopic motion is
completely gone,

01:11:24.983 --> 01:11:27.090
and all the motion is thermal
motion.

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:30.357
But it's still kinetic energy,
and that's what we will see the

01:11:30.357 --> 01:11:31.357
next time.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.005
Professor Amy
Hungerford: My first lecture

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.002
on The Known World
focused on the question of

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.469
knowledge and the problems of
knowledge that the text raises

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.159
for us throughout,
both at the formal level and at

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.298
the thematic level.
So, I ended up with a reading

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:24.634
of the account of the Broussard
trial and how more and more

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:29.602
detailed knowledge comes to us
through the voice of the

00:00:29.602 --> 00:00:32.598
narrator,
and we're really left with that

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:35.190
question: where does that
knowledge come from?

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.464
Now, I suggested in the first
lecture that my second lecture

00:00:38.464 --> 00:00:41.350
was going to be about an equally
abstract subject,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.927
and that is:
how can anything exist in the

00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:46.283
world?
I'm going to get to that about

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:49.990
in the middle of the lecture,
beginning from this question,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.942
though, where we ended last
time, about the Broussard trial

00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:56.520
and the problem of knowledge,
where knowledge comes from.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.369
If we look a little bit earlier
in the passage about the

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.639
Broussard trial on 171,
172, you find what I think is

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:09.938
quite a striking model for the
very problem of this novel as a

00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:14.267
whole.
And this is when Skiffington is

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:19.646
trying to write an account of
Broussard's crime,

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:24.110
and here it is on the bottom of
171.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:30.650
He's having trouble filling out
this form.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.769
Skiffington picked up the
list of questions.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:36.830
Now he would have to start all
over again.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.596
Nature of the alleged crime.
Are there witnesses to the

00:01:41.596 --> 00:01:44.709
alleged crime?
Can such witnesses be

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.962
believed?
So, the problem of evidence and

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:52.739
the problem of whether witnesses
are to be trusted,

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:58.449
the problem of enumerating a
crime, these are all problems

00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:04.659
that the novel as a whole takes
up for the crime of slavery.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.001
So, we can think of the novel
itself as a version of

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.521
Skiffington's report.
Now, it's important that

00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:15.320
Skiffington has such a problem
writing it.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.493
The very difficulty of writing
is thematized over and over and

00:02:24.493 --> 00:02:29.563
over again, not just in moments
like this where it's actually

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:33.730
talking about writing,
but, I'm going to argue,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.590
in a number of ways that are
much more subtle.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.979
And to show you one of them,
I want to look on 192 with you.

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:47.179
This is the scene where
Stamford, the slave,

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:52.741
is trying to remember the names
of his parents,

00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:57.740
and this is how he does it.
This is the middle of 192.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.122
He closed his eyes and
took his parents in his hands

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:08.678
and put them all about the
plantation where he had last

00:03:08.678 --> 00:03:11.830
seen them,
his mother in his left hand and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.803
his father in his right hand.
But that did not feel right,

00:03:15.803 --> 00:03:19.818
and so he put his father in his
left hand and his mother in his

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:22.150
right hand, and that felt
better.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.326
He set them outside the
smokehouse, which had a hole in

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:28.162
the roof in the back.
"Hants come down that hole and

00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:30.930
take you to the devil," an older
boy had once told him.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.936
Stamford was five,
and it had not been long since

00:03:33.936 --> 00:03:36.379
his parents had been sold
away.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.680
And you get more of the story,
and he finally comes to

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.680
remember the parents' names,
his parents' names.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.586
Why does he take them in these
specific hands,

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:57.910
his father in his right hand
and his mother in his left;

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.468
"that did not feel right so he
put his father in his left and

00:04:01.468 --> 00:04:05.422
his mother in the right"?
I would argue that this is for

00:04:05.422 --> 00:04:10.362
two reasons: a figure of Jones'
own writing, first of all in the

00:04:10.362 --> 00:04:13.969
obvious sense that it's an act
of recovery,

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.388
of recovering a past that needs
to be imagined,

00:04:17.388 --> 00:04:21.550
or somehow entered into,
not through rational thought,

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:27.504
but through an imaginative act.
So, that's one reason that

00:04:27.504 --> 00:04:31.069
Stamford in this moment is a
double of Jones.

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.860
But the other reason is this
"handedness" that's noted.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.929
I'm going to tell you,
throughout the lecture,

00:04:37.929 --> 00:04:41.563
a few things about Jones' life
and his work outside of this

00:04:41.563 --> 00:04:44.470
novel,
and so here's the first piece

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.757
of that story.
Edward P.

00:04:46.757 --> 00:04:53.528
Jones was the son of a very
poor single mother living in

00:04:53.528 --> 00:04:56.557
D.C.
He had a younger brother who

00:04:56.557 --> 00:05:01.434
was mentally disabled who had to
be given away to an institution

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.840
because the mother could not
support him.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:13.196
Jones' mother was illiterate.
So, here is someone writing

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:19.330
this novel, and his background
is an illiterate mother.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.100
This matters enormously to him.
He, in his first story

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.399
collection, has a story called
(I think it's called) "First

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:32.475
Day,"
where he tells the story of a

00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:36.600
young girl going off to school
for the first time,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.730
holding the hand of her
illiterate mother.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.629
Jones reveres his mother.
When he talks about her,

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.660
it's with incredible reverence
and love.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.740
Jones sees his mother very much
as a source of his writing.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.899
So, here's that first tension
in the act of writing,

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:04.451
that here is a writer who takes
as his source,

00:06:04.451 --> 00:06:08.699
spiritual source,
an illiterate woman.

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:14.269
That's why the mother has to go
in his right hand in this scene.

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:17.926
Now, of course,
not everybody writes with their

00:06:17.926 --> 00:06:22.168
right hand, but I think no
matter whether Jones is right or

00:06:22.168 --> 00:06:26.410
left handed--and I thank Andy
Heisel for pointing out,

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.276
our wonderful TA Andy Heisel,
for pointing out that in the

00:06:30.276 --> 00:06:33.939
photograph of Jones he is
wearing his watch on his left

00:06:33.939 --> 00:06:38.589
hand,
and so this would suggest that

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:42.629
he is, perhaps,
right handed.

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.902
But even if we didn't want to
rely--Oh, Neil,

00:06:46.902 --> 00:06:51.854
you're going to give me
trouble--even if you did not

00:06:51.854 --> 00:06:56.709
want to rely on that little
piece of evidence,

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:01.171
we can say that in the cultural
vocabulary of handedness the

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:04.649
dominant hand is the right hand
for writing.

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:11.128
So, I would say that whenever
you see right-handedness or

00:07:11.128 --> 00:07:15.250
left-to-right movement,
Jones is meditating on and

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.996
figuring the act of writing,
and I'm going to show you some

00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:20.079
more examples 'cause it's quite
striking.

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:23.930
It's subtle and strange,
but quite striking.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.537
So, the mother has to go in the
right hand because she is the

00:07:28.537 --> 00:07:31.402
source of inspiration.
The father--Jones'

00:07:31.402 --> 00:07:34.354
father--was very distant.
He only met him when he was

00:07:34.354 --> 00:07:38.037
much older, and he was not
really a part of Jones' life at

00:07:38.037 --> 00:07:41.484
all.
It really revolved around his

00:07:41.484 --> 00:07:44.875
mother.
So, if writing is undermined by

00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:49.757
the shadow of illiteracy for
Jones, it's undermined in other

00:07:49.757 --> 00:07:52.282
ways,
too, and I want to look at one

00:07:52.282 --> 00:07:56.050
of those stranger episodes.
This is on 142,143.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:08.137
This is the story of how Henry
began to court Caldonia at Fern

00:08:08.137 --> 00:08:14.127
Elston's dinner table,
and this is a very detailed

00:08:14.127 --> 00:08:19.470
scene.
This is in the middle of 142.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.962
He's telling Caldonia that she
needs to look up when she rides

00:08:22.962 --> 00:08:26.241
her horse.
He took the pepper shaker

00:08:26.241 --> 00:08:30.086
in his right hand,
extended his arm before him,

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:33.429
and moved the arm from right to
left.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.960
Everyone at the table was now
watching him.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.581
The hand with the shaker moved
smoothly, gracefully,

00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:43.159
from the right to the left.
"That's how everybody else

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:45.789
rides," Henry said,
"me and everybody else."

00:08:45.789 --> 00:08:49.466
Henry put the pepper shaker in
his left hand,

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:54.480
tipped it, and moved his arm
less gracefully from the left to

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.608
the right.
As it moved pepper poured out

00:08:57.608 --> 00:09:00.580
of the shaker onto Fern's white
tablecloth.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.460
He said, "I'm sorry to say
this, but that's how you ride."

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.149
Henry did this with the shaker
several times.

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:10.823
Going from right to left,
the pepper shaker was upright,

00:09:10.823 --> 00:09:14.429
but going from left to right
the pepper flowed down.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.104
Fern thought there was
something rather sad about the

00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:20.035
pepper falling and it was all
the sadder because it really

00:09:20.035 --> 00:09:23.279
didn't have to be that way.
She said to Anderson,

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:27.520
the pamphleteer from Canada,
this was his clumsy way of

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.840
telling Caldonia she was losing
something by not looking

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.437
up.
How odd, that insistence on the

00:09:35.437 --> 00:09:38.580
movement left to right,
right to left.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:46.635
It figures Henry's mixed-up
relation to both language and

00:09:46.635 --> 00:09:50.829
the act of creation.
It's mixed up,

00:09:50.829 --> 00:09:55.167
because when he is moving in
the direction that text is read

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:57.387
and written,
left to right,

00:09:57.387 --> 00:10:01.539
he's using his left hand,
and the correlative of that

00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:06.730
left handedness of his relation
to language is in the dialect.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:12.013
He doesn't speak correctly in
Fern Elston's house no matter

00:10:12.013 --> 00:10:16.584
how hard she tries to teach him.
So, he is clumsy,

00:10:16.584 --> 00:10:21.963
not only in spilling pepper on
the table, but also in not being

00:10:21.963 --> 00:10:27.101
able to speak proper English.
But the other thing about that

00:10:27.101 --> 00:10:31.746
movement is that when it goes
left to right pepper spills on

00:10:31.746 --> 00:10:35.296
the table.
This is an image of ink flowing

00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:40.267
out of a pen--it is black on the
white tablecloth--and it's an

00:10:40.267 --> 00:10:45.320
image for language in jeopardy
because of course it's dust;

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.129
it's powder;
it will never cohere;

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:53.769
it's the sign of his uncouth
table manners.

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:58.254
So, it's never going to be a
redemptive medium for him,

00:10:58.254 --> 00:11:03.070
and it's represented by this
pepper that then he can scrape

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.869
into a little pile.
This is the fragmentation

00:11:06.869 --> 00:11:09.410
of language in its very literal
sense.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.852
There are other examples of
this, on 189 when you get the

00:11:17.852 --> 00:11:24.160
first account of the frozen dog
that Calvin is so interested in,

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:29.905
in the photograph from New York.
Once again, direction is

00:11:29.905 --> 00:11:32.677
carefully noted.
In the front yard,

00:11:32.677 --> 00:11:35.289
alone, was a dog looking off to
the right.

00:11:35.289 --> 00:11:38.505
The dog was standing,
its tail sticking straight out

00:11:38.505 --> 00:11:42.539
as if ready to go at the first
word from someone on the porch.

00:11:42.539 --> 00:11:45.737
[And I'm going to skip down.]
He had a very tiny hope that

00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:49.159
when he got to New York he might
be able to find the house and

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:52.750
those people and that dog and
learn what had transfixed him.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.774
There was a whole world off to
the right that the photograph

00:11:56.774 --> 00:12:00.663
had not captured.
"Off to the right" is the

00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:05.992
direction of flowing narrative,
a world, a possible world that

00:12:05.992 --> 00:12:12.162
his imagination is drawn to,
and it's a visual image of the

00:12:12.162 --> 00:12:18.635
imagination and its seduction.
But because of this obsessive

00:12:18.635 --> 00:12:23.128
direction noting,
I would read it as a textual

00:12:23.128 --> 00:12:28.919
imagination, that there's a
narrative off to the right.

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:32.120
And you can see that Jones'
novel works this way.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.995
There is always a narrative
proximate to wherever you are,

00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:39.870
a little narrative that arises
from the next character who

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.340
shows up on the road,
and you'll get that narrative.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.098
So, this is just one of those
that doesn't quite get

00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:50.019
articulated, but Calvin can
imagine that it's there;

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:55.272
he can see, as if he can see
the form of the novel that Jones

00:12:55.272 --> 00:12:57.759
is writing.
And then there are just

00:12:57.759 --> 00:13:01.242
even tinier ones.
On 162, this is John

00:13:01.242 --> 00:13:09.377
Skiffington sitting and reading
the Bible after visiting Clara's

00:13:09.377 --> 00:13:12.135
house.
"Skiffington looked up and

00:13:12.135 --> 00:13:15.878
followed a male cardinal as it
flew from the left to right and

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:18.210
settled in one of the peach
trees."

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.786
They're all over the place once
you start noticing them,

00:13:22.786 --> 00:13:27.279
so I think this is why:
that it's a constant meditation

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:31.522
among the multiplying versions
of meditations on the

00:13:31.522 --> 00:13:35.600
composition of this novel within
the novel.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.655
So, we'll get to some others.
The problem is that the written

00:13:41.655 --> 00:13:47.653
word is always threatened.
So, if writing has all this

00:13:47.653 --> 00:13:53.045
static that surrounds it,
it also has some more direct

00:13:53.045 --> 00:13:58.437
and aggressive enemies,
and on 375 you see one version

00:13:58.437 --> 00:13:59.760
of that.

00:14:02.879 --> 00:14:09.990
This is the account of Barnum
Kinsey's grave marker that his

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:17.100
son makes after they leave
Manchester County and he dies.

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.240
This is at the bottom of 374.
Matthew stayed up all the

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.118
night before he was
buried--[this is Kinsey's son]

00:14:23.118 --> 00:14:26.289
putting his father's history on
a wooden tombstone.

00:14:26.289 --> 00:14:28.572
He began with his father's name
on the first line,

00:14:28.572 --> 00:14:31.274
and on the next he put the
years of the father's coming and

00:14:31.274 --> 00:14:34.063
going,
then all of the things he knew

00:14:34.063 --> 00:14:37.609
his father had been.
[And it then lists this whole

00:14:37.609 --> 00:14:40.390
set of things.]
The boy filled up the whole

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.369
piece of wood,
and at the end of the last line

00:14:43.369 --> 00:14:46.251
he put a period.
His father's grave would

00:14:46.251 --> 00:14:49.420
remain, but the wooden marker
would not last out the

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.127
year.
Text is simply fragile,

00:14:52.127 --> 00:14:56.282
as a material object,
so that's what this scene tells

00:14:56.282 --> 00:14:59.762
us, in a poignant way.
But, of course,

00:14:59.762 --> 00:15:05.295
the most poignant example of
this is when Augustus's free

00:15:05.295 --> 00:15:11.436
papers are eaten by Travis.
So, the real terror of the

00:15:11.436 --> 00:15:15.590
written word comes in that
scene.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:21.761
Now the terror is of course
that it's an exercise of

00:15:21.761 --> 00:15:25.149
power--arbitrary,
violent.

00:15:25.149 --> 00:15:29.130
It will end in Augustus' death
back in slavery.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.879
There are lots of ways of
imagining what the terror is.

00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:40.893
I'm going to go into some of
them, but this is the sign of

00:15:40.893 --> 00:15:45.119
it, that even though Augustus
has memorized every word of his

00:15:45.119 --> 00:15:48.691
free papers--remember,
we're told that he has them

00:15:48.691 --> 00:15:50.950
read to him every day for a
month.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.096
He's illiterate.
He has them read to him every

00:15:54.096 --> 00:15:58.525
day for a month until he has
them totally memorized after he

00:15:58.525 --> 00:16:02.953
gets his freedom--even though
those words will exist forever

00:16:02.953 --> 00:16:07.124
in Augustus' mind,
his freedom is nowhere,

00:16:07.124 --> 00:16:12.214
once the written word is gone.
So, this is my question:

00:16:12.214 --> 00:16:14.649
How can something exist in the
world?

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:19.890
Here, the ultimate thing to
which that question applies is

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.020
freedom.
How can freedom exist?

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:30.351
What makes freedom exist?
Well, in the law,

00:16:30.351 --> 00:16:35.370
those free papers make freedom
exist for Augustus,

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:41.105
but the law cannot guarantee
that freedom exists when the

00:16:41.105 --> 00:16:45.510
physical artifact of the text is
gone.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:50.980
That's how weak writing is.
It seems to be everything.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:58.159
This is something that Mildred
understood quite early on.

00:16:58.159 --> 00:17:07.273
On 113, when she and Augustus
are worried about Henry hanging

00:17:07.273 --> 00:17:12.840
out with Robbins,
she says, in suggesting that

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:18.009
it's okay to let Henry go about
with William Robbins,

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:22.098
"'Them free papers he carry
with him all over the place

00:17:22.098 --> 00:17:25.574
don't carry enough freedom,'
she said to her husband,

00:17:25.574 --> 00:17:29.615
'with slavery behind him.'"
She wanted her son to go about

00:17:29.615 --> 00:17:34.535
and see what had always been
denied him, so she wants the

00:17:34.535 --> 00:17:39.354
world to be a big place for him.
She sees that freedom is

00:17:39.354 --> 00:17:43.788
something much more than those
papers, but the problem is that

00:17:43.788 --> 00:17:49.349
freedom cannot be without them,
and that once they're gone,

00:17:49.349 --> 00:17:53.916
it is gone too.
So, that is one of the

00:17:53.916 --> 00:18:00.337
threats that is associated with
writing, but there are more of

00:18:00.337 --> 00:18:02.989
them.
On 311 and 312,

00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:08.898
one danger is that,
in the effort to write justice

00:18:08.898 --> 00:18:16.479
in law, it's simply ineffective.
So, here is the story we get of

00:18:16.479 --> 00:18:23.199
Skiffington trying to write up
this crime, the crime of selling

00:18:23.199 --> 00:18:27.860
Augustus, a free man,
back into slavery.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:34.220
This is on 312.
He's been in contact with a man

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:40.970
named Sanderson in,
I think he's in Georgia.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.910
He got a letter from
Sanderson three days after that.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:45.103
The crime had indeed been
committed, he wrote,

00:18:45.103 --> 00:18:48.126
and Sanderson included material
he had copied from books saying

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:49.970
so.
So, Skiffington wasn't sure

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.789
whether it was really a crime.
Somehow he began to get

00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:56.518
confused, and you can see that
confusion--I won't read it--on

00:18:56.518 --> 00:18:59.128
the prior page,
on 311 in the middle of the

00:18:59.128 --> 00:19:01.380
page.
So, when Skiffington once again

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.009
starts writing up the crime,
he becomes confused.

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:07.720
Did he really have a crime to
describe?

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:10.869
He gets confirmation that he
does.

00:19:10.869 --> 00:19:13.254
But Skiffington heard
from Richmond [yes,

00:19:13.254 --> 00:19:15.846
it's a letter from Richmond]
again four days later,

00:19:15.846 --> 00:19:17.920
in handwriting he did not
recognize.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.548
Graciela Sanderson let him know
that her husband,

00:19:20.548 --> 00:19:23.780
Harry, was dead and that she
was now charged with keeping up

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.738
his correspondence.
He read the eight-page letter

00:19:26.738 --> 00:19:30.370
twice, but he found nothing in
it about what Virginia was doing

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.890
about the crime of selling free
Negroes.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.608
The widow told him about her
husband, how she had met him

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:39.906
when he vacationed in Italy,
how he had wooed her,

00:19:39.906 --> 00:19:43.390
brought her to America after
their wedding and made her a

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:47.971
happy woman in Richmond,
" where the governor is in

00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:51.195
residence."
[And then she closes with

00:19:51.195 --> 00:19:53.306
comments about the weather.]

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:59.802
So, the law's effort to deliver
justice through the writing of a

00:19:59.802 --> 00:20:03.170
crime, the documenting of a
crime,

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:08.657
is displaced by a woman's
effort to recover her lost

00:20:08.657 --> 00:20:14.424
husband by telling that story.
So, there are competing claims

00:20:14.424 --> 00:20:18.765
on language in this scene:
the widow's and Skiffington's,

00:20:18.765 --> 00:20:22.329
and more distantly Augustus'
and Mildred's.

00:20:22.329 --> 00:20:27.660
None of these claims are
adjudicated in any kind of way

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:32.863
that puts one above the other,
and Skiffington's weakness,

00:20:32.863 --> 00:20:36.647
of course, is that he will
never seek to right that

00:20:36.647 --> 00:20:39.778
balance.
He resigns himself to the

00:20:39.778 --> 00:20:41.710
weakness of writing.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.914
More chillingly,
and I think more

00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:55.102
complicatingly,
writing also carries the risk

00:20:55.102 --> 00:21:00.880
of reinstating the master-slave
relationship,

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:08.443
and I think it does this by
direct reference back to Jones

00:21:08.443 --> 00:21:12.581
himself.
If you read slowly through the

00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:17.079
scene of Augustus being sold
back into slavery,

00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:23.770
it's quite striking the way
contingency or happenstance

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:29.808
plays a part in the scene.
So, after Travis has eaten

00:21:29.808 --> 00:21:35.736
Augustus' papers--this is at the
very bottom of 212--"a wagon

00:21:35.736 --> 00:21:41.170
twice as large as Augustus' came
up to the four men.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:45.446
Driving it was a large black
man, and beside him a much

00:21:45.446 --> 00:21:49.258
smaller white man."
And Travis teases Darcy,

00:21:49.258 --> 00:21:53.464
the slave trader,
about how he's never known the

00:21:53.464 --> 00:21:57.313
time in his life,
but suddenly here he is at

00:21:57.313 --> 00:22:02.414
exactly the right time.
Then he later says--as he's

00:22:02.414 --> 00:22:07.123
formulating the idea of selling
Augustus to Darcy,

00:22:07.123 --> 00:22:11.160
he says--"God works in
mysterious ways.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.447
This ain't exactly what I had
in mind when I stopped this

00:22:15.447 --> 00:22:18.970
nigger but this here will do
just the same."

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:25.610
Who made that wagon appear?
Why does that wagon appear?

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:32.277
Jones made that wagon appear.
What we're given is not a

00:22:32.277 --> 00:22:38.028
fiction about Travis intending
to sell Augustus back into

00:22:38.028 --> 00:22:43.882
slavery, but what we're given
instead is a surprise on the

00:22:43.882 --> 00:22:46.910
road.
Who makes that surprise appear?

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:51.524
Only one person,
the person in charge of making

00:22:51.524 --> 00:22:55.023
the narrative.
So, the problem with

00:22:55.023 --> 00:22:59.125
writing is not just that it's
shadowed by the fact of

00:22:59.125 --> 00:23:01.909
illiteracy.
It's not just that it's

00:23:01.909 --> 00:23:07.273
vulnerable to physical decay.
It's not just that it's weak

00:23:07.273 --> 00:23:11.920
and it can't make anything exist
in law.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:16.804
It's not just that it's
demanded by multiple people for

00:23:16.804 --> 00:23:21.869
different purposes that come to
cancel each other out.

00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:27.226
It's that by writing,
by taking on that quality of

00:23:27.226 --> 00:23:31.818
masterfulness,
you begin to be complicit in

00:23:31.818 --> 00:23:36.410
the very crime that you're
describing.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:43.199
The imagery of God looking down
on his creation is everywhere in

00:23:43.199 --> 00:23:47.925
this novel,
and it's applied to all kinds

00:23:47.925 --> 00:23:51.364
of characters,
including Henry,

00:23:51.364 --> 00:23:58.015
who thinks that he will look
down on his slaves the way God

00:23:58.015 --> 00:24:03.059
looks down on his creation from
heaven.

00:24:03.059 --> 00:24:08.883
That position of mastery and
that geographic remove of being

00:24:08.883 --> 00:24:14.509
above your subject is associated
with the slave-master,

00:24:14.509 --> 00:24:18.410
but it's associated very much
with Jones.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.188
And I'll come back to this in a
minute when I talk about the

00:24:22.188 --> 00:24:25.838
tapestry, because of course the
tapestry at the end of the

00:24:25.838 --> 00:24:29.617
novel--Alice's tapestry--is the
most dramatic figure for the

00:24:29.617 --> 00:24:32.430
whole novel.
There are lots of figures for

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.349
the novel, including the map of
the "known world,"

00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:42.119
but foremost that tapestry at
the end which mimics the novel

00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:46.468
in every way.
Even that has the perspective

00:24:46.468 --> 00:24:51.725
of little figures looking up,
so it even puts Alice in that

00:24:51.725 --> 00:24:57.170
masterful position,
or indeed anyone who looks upon

00:24:57.170 --> 00:25:02.518
that tapestry.
So, if writing is so weak,

00:25:02.518 --> 00:25:09.139
if it entails such terror,
are we given any alternative

00:25:09.139 --> 00:25:13.951
for creative durability?
And I think we are,

00:25:13.951 --> 00:25:18.110
in the plastic arts.
Now, I'm sure you've noticed

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:23.648
how much carving goes on in the
book, not just because Augustus

00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:27.578
is a woodworker,
but because Elias carves for

00:25:27.578 --> 00:25:30.700
Celeste;
that's his first act of love.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:35.441
And, if you read Jones'
stories, this is rampant in his

00:25:35.441 --> 00:25:38.778
stories.
He has carvers everywhere and

00:25:38.778 --> 00:25:42.339
various kinds of workers in
plastic arts.

00:25:42.339 --> 00:25:46.885
Alice is another example
working in textiles,

00:25:46.885 --> 00:25:51.223
clay, paint,
some amalgamation of sculpture

00:25:51.223 --> 00:25:54.855
and painting.
On 279 the two arts,

00:25:54.855 --> 00:26:00.668
the verbal art and woodworking,
are put in competition with one

00:26:00.668 --> 00:26:03.353
another,
or in juxtaposition with one

00:26:03.353 --> 00:26:06.779
another, and I think you see who
has the upper hand here.

00:26:06.779 --> 00:26:11.406
This is an account of
Skiffington's bookcase,

00:26:11.406 --> 00:26:13.720
which Augustus made.

00:26:17.259 --> 00:26:19.998
In Winifred and John
Skiffington's parlor there was a

00:26:19.998 --> 00:26:23.203
wondrous-looking bookcase,
lovely oak, a lion's growling

00:26:23.203 --> 00:26:26.450
face at each edge of the top
ends, three shelves,

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.538
a secondhand item made by
Augustus Townsend not long after

00:26:30.538 --> 00:26:34.184
Augustus bought his freedom.
He had first thought he would

00:26:34.184 --> 00:26:36.915
keep it for himself and the
family he would buy out of

00:26:36.915 --> 00:26:39.440
slavery, though none of them
could read, then.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.859
He and Mildred would never
learn to read.

00:26:41.859 --> 00:26:43.900
[There is that shadow of
illiteracy.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.095
Our attention is called to it
the minute the books are

00:26:47.095 --> 00:26:49.506
mentioned.]
He would keep it as a kind of

00:26:49.506 --> 00:26:52.220
symbol for his determination to
get them,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.365
but then he realized that what
he could get for the bookcase

00:26:55.365 --> 00:26:58.616
would bring his wife and child
closer to him so he put a price

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.259
on it,
fifteen dollars.

00:27:00.259 --> 00:27:04.849
It had been originally sold to
a man of two slaves who lost his

00:27:04.849 --> 00:27:08.475
sight, [another risk to reading:
you can go blind]

00:27:08.475 --> 00:27:10.786
and so,
as he told Skiffington,

00:27:10.786 --> 00:27:13.259
lost his hunger and thirst for
books.

00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:16.630
Skiffington bought it for five
dollars.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:24.577
Augustus' art is durable.
It can be passed from person to

00:27:24.577 --> 00:27:27.529
person, and it maintains its
figurative power.

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:30.609
It's important that all of his
work is figurative.

00:27:30.609 --> 00:27:35.636
It suggests narrative,
and so it's aligned with Jones'

00:27:35.636 --> 00:27:39.904
art, in that way,
but it is not subject to the

00:27:39.904 --> 00:27:44.930
vulnerability of text,
and here in this bookcase you

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:50.140
see the vulnerability of text
set right next to the wondrous

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.720
durability of the bookcase.
There are other examples.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.113
When Rita is discovered in the
box of walking sticks,

00:27:59.113 --> 00:28:03.759
when she is sent in a box out
of slavery to New York,

00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:08.190
she hands the boy who is
looking down at her the walking

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:12.380
stick with Adam and Eve and all
their generations.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:17.306
It's as if in that act Rita's
freedom is instantiated,

00:28:17.306 --> 00:28:22.140
that she and all her
descendants emerge into this new

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.988
world,
and that that is a kind of gift

00:28:24.988 --> 00:28:27.960
to the family that takes them
in, in the North.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:32.404
So, it has a very evocative
narrative power that doesn't

00:28:32.404 --> 00:28:35.880
depend on people's being able to
read it,

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.137
and we're told in that scene
that the boy receives it as if

00:28:39.137 --> 00:28:41.890
this is what he had been waiting
for all along,

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.809
suggests a perfect receptivity,
no going blind here,

00:28:45.809 --> 00:28:47.500
perfect receptivity.

00:28:51.009 --> 00:28:57.394
There is also on 219 one of
Augustus' chairs that I think is

00:28:57.394 --> 00:28:59.450
worth looking at.

00:29:05.299 --> 00:29:08.221
This is when Travis is
reflecting on,

00:29:08.221 --> 00:29:12.765
or we are being told about,
how Travis first came to know

00:29:12.765 --> 00:29:15.317
Augustus.
He had first come to know

00:29:15.317 --> 00:29:18.215
Augustus Townsend many years ago
through a chair Augustus had

00:29:18.215 --> 00:29:20.630
made for a white man in the town
of Manchester.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:25.339
The man weighed more than four
hundred pounds.

00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:29.250
[And then I'm skipping down.]
In the man's parlor was

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.130
Augustus' chair,
plain,

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.619
not even painted,
but smooth to the touch,

00:29:33.619 --> 00:29:37.020
and when the man sat in it the
chair did not complain,

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.572
not one squeak.
It just held up and did its

00:29:40.572 --> 00:29:45.779
job, waiting for the man to put
on another three hundred pounds.

00:29:45.779 --> 00:29:49.537
Travis examined the chair,
looked all about it trying to

00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:53.530
discover its secret.
The chair gave nothing.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.974
It was a very good chair.
It was a chair worth

00:29:56.974 --> 00:30:00.009
stealing.
The chair gave nothing.

00:30:00.009 --> 00:30:03.769
Well, it gave nothing in terms
of knowledge to Travis.

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:07.880
It would not give up its secret
of durability,

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.807
and that's, in a way,
what makes it durable,

00:30:11.807 --> 00:30:17.470
that it can hide the essence of
itself, keep it to itself.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:19.819
It takes the weight without one
squeak.

00:30:19.819 --> 00:30:26.730
Its very silence is what marks
its invulnerability.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.600
It's also what enrages a man
like Travis.

00:30:34.349 --> 00:30:41.205
So, the novel sets up a
competing set of art forms,

00:30:41.205 --> 00:30:47.679
carving foremost among them,
against the art form of

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:52.527
language.
The tapestry at the end answers

00:30:52.527 --> 00:30:56.963
one of our questions from the
first lecture,

00:30:56.963 --> 00:31:02.430
which is who knows the known
world, known by whom?

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.918
What we come to find out is
that Alice, although she seemed

00:31:06.918 --> 00:31:10.710
insane, is the one who knows
Manchester County.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:16.539
She has walked all over it,
in the freedom carved out by

00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:20.936
her insanity.
One thing that's interesting

00:31:20.936 --> 00:31:25.445
about Alice is that she--despite
her insanity,

00:31:25.445 --> 00:31:31.859
seeming insanity--is the one
most in control of her language.

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:37.640
She is the most successful
storyteller in this novel.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.270
So, if you think of other
alternatives,

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:46.238
Moses--He tells Caldonia
stories that finally fail to

00:31:46.238 --> 00:31:51.589
persuade her imagination that
any slave she owns could be

00:31:51.589 --> 00:31:53.965
free.
We're told explicitly,

00:31:53.965 --> 00:31:57.400
as Calvin tries to persuade her
at the end of the novel,

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.868
that it's her failure of
imagination that keeps her from

00:32:00.868 --> 00:32:03.769
emancipating her slaves after
Henry's death.

00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:08.744
Despite all of Moses' stories,
she still cannot see him,

00:32:08.744 --> 00:32:11.910
or anyone else,
as a free person.

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:17.711
So, Moses' storytelling is
a complete failure in this way,

00:32:17.711 --> 00:32:23.513
but Alice's storytelling about
the mule that kicked her in the

00:32:23.513 --> 00:32:26.235
head,
we find that out early in the

00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:29.837
novel that the story about
her--that's why she is said to

00:32:29.837 --> 00:32:36.530
be crazy we're told--so vivid,
so sad, that everybody believed

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:39.738
it.
The very control she has over

00:32:39.738 --> 00:32:44.796
her crazy chants is what
persuades the whole world around

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:48.769
her that she is not worth
bothering with,

00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:55.240
as she wanders around the roads
with impunity.

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.539
It also gives her occasion to
mock the master,

00:32:59.539 --> 00:33:03.360
the structure of slavery,
the patrollers,

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.660
and she can do it with
impunity, as well.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.093
So, she has a freedom of mind
as well as a freedom of movement

00:33:12.093 --> 00:33:15.799
that nobody else in the novel
has who is a slave.

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:24.205
So, she is doubly marked as an
artist in language and in the

00:33:24.205 --> 00:33:29.476
plastic arts,
but she is--importantly,

00:33:29.476 --> 00:33:34.893
I think--not a writer.
You'll note,

00:33:34.893 --> 00:33:39.607
if you look at 384,385,
where the tapestry is

00:33:39.607 --> 00:33:45.819
described, there is still some
whiff of that fragility.

00:33:45.819 --> 00:33:51.291
And I see that in the
admonition that is hung next to

00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:57.816
the tapestry and that Priscilla
repeats when Calvin reaches out

00:33:57.816 --> 00:34:03.289
to touch it.
She says, "Please do not touch."

00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:06.083
There is that sense that this
is still something that needs to

00:34:06.083 --> 00:34:10.510
be protected.
Now, why the terror?

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.558
Why the fragility?
Well, I think this has a lot to

00:34:15.558 --> 00:34:18.230
do with how this novel was
composed.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:21.720
Edward P.
Jones wrote his first book of

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:26.130
short stories in the 1990s,
in the early '90s.

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.500
I can't remember the date
exactly.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.330
And it was very successful,
but not successful enough to

00:34:33.330 --> 00:34:38.335
support him, so he worked as an
editor at a journal called

00:34:38.335 --> 00:34:44.712
Tax Notes.
It was a journal of tax law,

00:34:44.712 --> 00:34:48.746
scintillating.
Jones was working there,

00:34:48.746 --> 00:34:52.429
and I'm going to tell you a
story, now, that he tells in

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:56.527
some of his interviews,
but I heard first from his

00:34:56.527 --> 00:35:01.423
agent, a guy named Eric
Simonoff, who I had up to visit

00:35:01.423 --> 00:35:06.320
one of my classes when we were
studying this novel.

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:11.547
Eric says that he heard from
Edward that Edward had this idea

00:35:11.547 --> 00:35:15.816
for a novel about a black slave
owner but he said,

00:35:15.816 --> 00:35:20.840
"Don't tell anyone.
This is a stealable idea."

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.270
So Eric, when he went down to
D.C., would occasionally stop in

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.320
over the years and see Edward
and he'd say,

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.443
"Well, how's the novel going?"
Didn't seem to be much on

00:35:33.443 --> 00:35:37.582
paper, and time passed,
ten years or so,

00:35:37.582 --> 00:35:42.463
and Eric thought,
"I'm not sure if this novel's

00:35:42.463 --> 00:35:48.294
ever going to get written."
In the meantime Jones had

00:35:48.294 --> 00:35:53.943
amassed about a hundred and
twenty five books of history of

00:35:53.943 --> 00:35:57.449
the period that he is working
in,

00:35:57.449 --> 00:35:59.690
in the novel,
because he felt that in order

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.730
to write a novel like this he
really needed to master that

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.385
history.
It was very intimidating to

00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:08.960
him, though, so that--combined
with his Tax Notes

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.690
job--he had about twelve pages
written.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:15.720
So, he went on vacation after a
long time.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.808
He hadn't had a vacation.
He had about a six-week

00:36:18.808 --> 00:36:22.411
vacation, and he finally got a
start, and one of the ways that

00:36:22.411 --> 00:36:25.837
he got himself to start was he
decided that he was going to

00:36:25.837 --> 00:36:30.119
forget about the history;
he was going to make it all up.

00:36:30.119 --> 00:36:32.532
So, all the historical
sources-- if you read the back

00:36:32.532 --> 00:36:35.176
of the book you will know
this--all the historical sources

00:36:35.176 --> 00:36:36.289
are fictional,
here.

00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:41.185
The census reports,
every detail is fictional,

00:36:41.185 --> 00:36:46.702
so that was his first move.
Then he got laid off from

00:36:46.702 --> 00:36:50.860
Tax Notes right after
this vacation.

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.658
Edward P.
Jones then wrote this novel in

00:36:55.658 --> 00:37:00.703
three months,
and Eric says that it became

00:37:00.703 --> 00:37:07.963
clear to him over the years that
Jones had in fact memorized

00:37:07.963 --> 00:37:13.869
entire chapters of what became
this novel.

00:37:13.869 --> 00:37:18.763
It was all in his head,
all the words in their order,

00:37:18.763 --> 00:37:24.503
and so when he had the time and
when he freed himself from the

00:37:24.503 --> 00:37:29.750
obligation to history,
out it came.

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:36.206
I think this says a lot
about the images of writing that

00:37:36.206 --> 00:37:42.194
you see all over the novel.
Imagine the kind of terror that

00:37:42.194 --> 00:37:46.188
you would feel,
knowing that you had all this

00:37:46.188 --> 00:37:51.271
in your mind and knowing also
that it didn't yet exist on

00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:54.599
paper,
that you had only twelve pages.

00:37:54.599 --> 00:37:59.650
Maybe if you're writing papers
now, you feel this terror of the

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.360
blank page.
It's possible.

00:38:04.610 --> 00:38:08.420
That's a real terror for a
writer.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:14.194
Combine that with the shadow of
illiteracy, the feeling of

00:38:14.194 --> 00:38:19.783
possible betrayal,
for a son to be a writer when

00:38:19.783 --> 00:38:26.420
his beloved mother had no access
to the written word.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:30.106
This is a very vexed,
complex psychological

00:38:30.106 --> 00:38:35.108
relationship that I would
suggest--my guess is--that has a

00:38:35.108 --> 00:38:40.375
lot to do with how he imagines
the relative fragility and the

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:45.289
relative power of fiction versus
these other arts.

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:51.301
So, Jones models his narrative
on those other arts in an effort

00:38:51.301 --> 00:38:57.118
to solve the problems that are
presented by the terror of the

00:38:57.118 --> 00:39:05.287
written word's fragility,
its very uneasy relation to

00:39:05.287 --> 00:39:08.550
existence.
Does a novel exist?

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.612
Does it not?
And I think there is,

00:39:11.612 --> 00:39:17.153
actually, even a figure for
Jones in a particular character,

00:39:17.153 --> 00:39:20.910
one of these tiny characters,
on 343.

00:39:30.869 --> 00:39:34.520
This is a young man with a
wonderfully complicated mind.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.803
Wilson had learned a
great deal at that university,

00:39:41.803 --> 00:39:44.599
and his mind would have
contained even more,

00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:48.713
but well in to his second year
the cadavers began to talk to

00:39:48.713 --> 00:39:52.757
Wilson and what they said made
far more sense than what his

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:55.519
professors were saying.
The professors,

00:39:55.519 --> 00:39:58.862
being gods, did not like to
share their heaven with anyone

00:39:58.862 --> 00:40:01.420
dead or alive,
and they sent the young man

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.019
home in the middle of his second
year.

00:40:04.019 --> 00:40:10.073
Here you see a figure for
someone whose imagination is so

00:40:10.073 --> 00:40:14.289
powerful that it makes the dead
talk,

00:40:14.289 --> 00:40:18.960
and think back again to the
image of Stamford finding--by

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.630
placing the image of his parents
all over the mansion,

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.929
all over the
plantation--finding their names.

00:40:26.929 --> 00:40:31.170
That's a little like talking to
cadavers.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:39.070
They are dead, those parents.
It verges on insanity.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:43.480
This is another problem with
the mode of composition,

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.891
that a mind this powerfully
populated by an alternate

00:40:47.891 --> 00:40:52.536
reality comes to look insane,
and I think this is another

00:40:52.536 --> 00:40:55.820
reason why Alice is what she is
as a character.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:01.508
If she is going to be one of
the major doubles for Jones,

00:41:01.508 --> 00:41:05.469
her insanity is part of that
picture.

00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:10.006
We can think of it as a willed
insanity, but it has the residue

00:41:10.006 --> 00:41:14.017
of doubt about it.
Maybe she really is insane to

00:41:14.017 --> 00:41:18.353
some degree.
Is there a sharp line between

00:41:18.353 --> 00:41:24.520
an imagination that can produce
a narrative so thoroughly

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:31.238
populated as this one and a mind
that sees cadavers talking to

00:41:31.238 --> 00:41:32.230
you?

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:43.145
Another thing that is
remarkable about Jones'

00:41:43.145 --> 00:41:48.539
work--and this relates back to
what I was saying about

00:41:48.539 --> 00:41:54.137
postmodernism and grand
narrative last time--Jones' work

00:41:54.137 --> 00:41:59.905
is seemingly very fragmented.
There are lots and lots of

00:41:59.905 --> 00:42:05.250
narratives, but they don't all
come together in one narrative,

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:10.143
so it seems fragmented,
and when you start to read it,

00:42:10.143 --> 00:42:15.087
it looks disorienting.
If you read his stories,

00:42:15.087 --> 00:42:21.793
you will see that all of the
stories are interconnected back

00:42:21.793 --> 00:42:25.429
to the novel,
to Jones' life.

00:42:25.429 --> 00:42:27.868
So, for instance in All Aunt
Hagar's Children,

00:42:27.868 --> 00:42:29.849
his most recent story
collection,

00:42:29.849 --> 00:42:33.682
and I think it came out in
2007, there is a woman who has a

00:42:33.682 --> 00:42:36.920
walking stick that is clearly
made by Augustus,

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.536
in the twentieth century.
What I was saying about the

00:42:41.536 --> 00:42:45.395
durability of the plastic arts
is imagined in that quality of

00:42:45.395 --> 00:42:49.555
his fiction.
These objects of carving turn

00:42:49.555 --> 00:42:54.479
up throughout his stories.
Also, people are related to

00:42:54.479 --> 00:42:58.715
each other in separate stories.
They're related to people in

00:42:58.715 --> 00:43:02.456
this novel.
The title of this novel appears

00:43:02.456 --> 00:43:08.289
in a story called "Tapestry" in
All Aunt Hagar's Children.

00:43:08.289 --> 00:43:12.758
He is obsessive about
putting the locations of all the

00:43:12.758 --> 00:43:17.470
places that he lived in D.C.
into his stories perfectly

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.237
accurately.
When an editor at The New

00:43:20.237 --> 00:43:23.951
Yorker tried to get him to
change one of these descriptions

00:43:23.951 --> 00:43:26.858
and the address,
in one of the stories that he

00:43:26.858 --> 00:43:29.969
submitted for the magazine,
he was very resistant.

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:32.184
He finally changed it for
The New Yorker,

00:43:32.184 --> 00:43:34.929
but when it went into the
story collection it went back,

00:43:34.929 --> 00:43:38.701
because he wanted it to be
absolutely accurate to what it

00:43:38.701 --> 00:43:43.934
was like when he lived there,
what it actually looks like on

00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:48.050
that corner in D.C.
What I think Jones is

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:53.141
doing, in the largest version of
his project, is actually one of

00:43:53.141 --> 00:43:57.748
the most wide-reaching and
ambitious unifying efforts that

00:43:57.748 --> 00:44:00.900
I know of in contemporary
fiction.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.197
So, this is not about the
fragmentation of grand

00:44:04.197 --> 00:44:08.076
narrative.
It's about the enormous,

00:44:08.076 --> 00:44:13.010
large-scale accumulation of
wholeness.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:17.467
He is piecing a world together,
bit by bit by bit,

00:44:17.467 --> 00:44:21.380
as he adds to his literary
oeuvre.

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:28.325
So, this is a vision of unity
that goes way beyond generic

00:44:28.325 --> 00:44:31.300
boundaries.
Is it a short story?

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:36.437
Is it a novel?
This is something more like an

00:44:36.437 --> 00:44:41.082
opus that Jones is building,
and, more importantly,

00:44:41.082 --> 00:44:46.099
it's something that lives in
his mind very clearly.

00:44:46.099 --> 00:44:49.044
These people,
these characters,

00:44:49.044 --> 00:44:53.656
live in his mind.
There is no one doing what

00:44:53.656 --> 00:44:58.342
Jones is doing today.
If there is something truly

00:44:58.342 --> 00:45:01.579
postmodern, I would say Jones is
it.

00:45:01.579 --> 00:45:08.066
He looks very different from
what comes before him,

00:45:08.066 --> 00:45:12.996
in modernism,
and its ascendancy in the

00:45:12.996 --> 00:45:18.562
mid-twentieth century.
He is making pretty dramatic

00:45:18.562 --> 00:45:23.340
claims for the power of fiction,
for the power of narrative,

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.420
to put the world together,
but at the same time,

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.458
as I've noted,
acknowledges the very

00:45:30.458 --> 00:45:36.193
difficulty of that project,
the very weakness that lies at

00:45:36.193 --> 00:45:39.584
its heart.
And I think that's what,

00:45:39.584 --> 00:45:43.471
for me, makes his work
extremely powerful,

00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:48.968
that for all its ambition we're
never allowed to forget its

00:45:48.968 --> 00:45:52.534
ambivalence.
That ambivalence is always

00:45:52.534 --> 00:45:56.216
there on the surface,
and it's bodied forth in the

00:45:56.216 --> 00:46:00.349
kinds of moral problems that
this novel dwells upon,

00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:05.015
the question of how human love
can exist in slavery,

00:46:05.015 --> 00:46:09.590
whether it can exist,
all its complicated forms,

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:13.294
what the forms of freedom look
like, how freedom can possibly

00:46:13.294 --> 00:46:16.880
exist, how you build it,
how it can be maintained.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:24.397
All these things are there in
an incredibly ambitious literary

00:46:24.397 --> 00:46:28.638
form.
That's what Jones is doing that

00:46:28.638 --> 00:46:32.670
nobody else is doing at this
moment.

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:37.496
So, I will stop there and we
will think about what Foer is

00:46:37.496 --> 00:46:41.645
doing on--I will think about
what Foer is doing on

00:46:41.645 --> 00:46:42.645
Monday.

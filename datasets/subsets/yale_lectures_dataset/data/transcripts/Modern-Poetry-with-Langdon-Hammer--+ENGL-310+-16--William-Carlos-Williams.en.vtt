00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.501
Professor Langdon
Hammer: I'm going to talk

00:00:14.501 --> 00:00:16.070
about William Carlos Williams
today.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.210
It may be that I end up
carrying a little bit of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.440
Williams over to next time--to
Marianne Moore,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:33.451
his friend, contemporary,
and really close collaborator,

00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:43.610
in a sense, in the New York
scene of modernism in the teens,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.658
twenties, thirties,
forties, and on into the

00:00:47.658 --> 00:00:50.452
fifties.
This is the man,

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:55.200
as a young man,
William Carlos Williams.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.839
If you open your anthologies to
page 284, in the long and useful

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:10.010
head-note that Jahan Ramazani
provides you,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.983
there's this quotation from a
letter in the middle of page 284

00:01:15.983 --> 00:01:19.900
that Williams wrote to Harriet
Monroe,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.753
the editor of Poetry
whom thirteen years later Hart

00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:28.670
Crane would write to in defense
of his poem,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.049
"At Melville's Tomb."
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.849
And Williams says in this
letter to Monroe:

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:38.837
Most current verse is
dead from the point of view of

00:01:38.837 --> 00:01:41.900
art… [It's dead,
it's lifeless;

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.333
and what Williams cares about
is something he calls "life."]

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:52.858
Now life is above all things
else at any moment subversive of

00:01:52.858 --> 00:01:58.660
life as it was the moment before
[and I think that's how we know

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.541
it in Williams's life:
whatever is subverting whatever

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.120
was a moment before.
 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:13.846
And subversive is probably an
important and suggestive word

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:18.110
there]--always new,
irregular.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.733
[He wants what is new,
and what is new is going to be

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:26.824
what is irregular,
and what is irregular has in

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:31.270
some sense subverted what was in
place before.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.222
He continues.]
Verse to be alive [to have what

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:40.294
Pound, I think,
would have called "the

00:02:40.294 --> 00:02:44.036
impulse"]
must have infused into it

00:02:44.036 --> 00:02:50.750
something of the same order [it
has to have life in it,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.178
or what he calls]
some tincture of

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:58.958
disestablishment,
something in the nature of an

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:04.498
impalpable revolution,
an ethereal reversal,

00:03:04.498 --> 00:03:07.755
let me say.
I am speaking of modern

00:03:07.755 --> 00:03:11.411
verse.
Like certain of our other

00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:16.219
poets, Williams is
self-consciously modern.

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:22.040
He's defining what "modern"
means, and he's defining it as a

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.479
quality of experience that he
calls "life,"

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:33.383
that has the quality of
disrupting whatever was in

00:03:33.383 --> 00:03:36.060
existence before.
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:42.934
And this is a quality and
energy that he wants to have in

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:45.389
his poetry itself.
 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:51.524
This is Williams a little bit
older, Williams in 1924,

00:03:51.524 --> 00:03:58.470
when he has established himself
through the poems in a volume

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.148
called Spring and All,
as one of the major modern

00:04:06.148 --> 00:04:08.819
poets in America.
 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.340
He is the author of a poem –
have you ever seen it?

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.829
– called "The Red
Wheelbarrow."

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:21.450
And that might be a good place
to begin.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.820
That's on pages 294 to 295.
 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.970
Of course, I'm joking.
 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.873
Probably that's the one poem
everybody in this class has read

00:04:31.873 --> 00:04:34.569
before they came to this class.
 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:39.376
It is better known than "The
Negro Speaks of Rivers" or

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:43.560
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy
Evening," even.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.026
It is also distinguished,
I think, as being the second

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:52.829
shortest modern poem after "In a
Station of the Metro,"

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:56.120
a poem that it's related to in
certain ways.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.984
In fact, a link between
Williams and Pound is important,

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:05.444
it's relevant.
Pound was a friend and rival

00:05:05.444 --> 00:05:09.360
for Williams throughout his
career.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.522
Williams is sometimes seen in
his early stages as a kind of

00:05:16.522 --> 00:05:23.561
Imagist or at any rate as a poet
influenced by the Imagist

00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:28.130
aesthetic.
Imagism is, of course,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.940
a visual metaphor,
and Williams is above all a

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.329
visual poet, a poet of the eye.
 

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:41.670
so much depends upon a
red wheel barrow

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:49.029
glazed with rain water
beside the white chickens.

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:55.414
Well, I think you have to see
that poem to start to really be

00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:58.788
able to read it.
It, I think,

00:05:58.788 --> 00:06:04.988
probably does involve some
subtle vocal and auditory

00:06:04.988 --> 00:06:09.213
experience,
but it's first of all a poem

00:06:09.213 --> 00:06:13.810
that meets you and challenges
you through the eye,

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.790
as a visual object in some
sense on the page.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:25.115
The kind of seeing that
Williams's poems call for is--we

00:06:25.115 --> 00:06:30.750
can think of it as a way of
reading that his poems

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.279
themselves demand.
 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:36.549
In other words,
there's a kind of link between

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:40.908
how he sees the world and the
way in which he asks us to read

00:06:40.908 --> 00:06:43.990
him.
His poems model a kind of

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.816
seeing.
Unlike "In a Station of the

00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:54.428
Metro," "The Red Wheelbarrow,"
or let me call it instead "So

00:06:54.428 --> 00:06:59.360
Much Depends," is a poem without
a title.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.960
This title, "The Red
Wheelbarrow," was like the title

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.146
"This is Just to Say" in the
poem that follows,

00:07:06.146 --> 00:07:08.569
the almost equally famous poem.
 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:14.329
These are titles Williams added
later to his work.

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:20.138
In Spring and All--that
volume, the first edition,

00:07:20.138 --> 00:07:26.050
1923 – the poem appears
simply as a text on the page.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.600
And that's important.
 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.596
It's part of--it's as important
as the title is for "In a

00:07:32.596 --> 00:07:34.310
Station of the Metro."
 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:37.569
Simply presenting the poem on
the page to us,

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:40.680
as Williams does,
doing without a title,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.639
Williams asks us to,
in some sense,

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:47.730
read and encounter this poem
without a frame,

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.945
without some kind of
pre-established boundary or

00:07:52.945 --> 00:07:56.940
explanatory introduction or
entry.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:02.620
That choice increases the
immediacy of our experience.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:09.022
It's as if Williams were asking
you to kind of press up close to

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:13.900
the poem, face it,
just as he is facing the thing

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.309
he is writing about;
or asks us to face not the

00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:26.392
thing that he's writing about so
much as his act of writing and

00:08:26.392 --> 00:08:33.360
seeing, his act of writing as it
embodies a way of seeing.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:40.783
The poem has a suggestion that
it requires as a poem the same

00:08:40.783 --> 00:08:47.464
kind of calm intensity of
concentration that the poet's

00:08:47.464 --> 00:08:53.279
observation of the wheelbarrow
exemplifies.

00:08:53.279 --> 00:09:00.394
So again, I think the kind of
seeing that the poem does models

00:09:00.394 --> 00:09:02.610
a way of reading.
 

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:09.370
Well, what is that way of
reading?

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:15.552
How does the poem embody in its
construction – which it calls

00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:21.136
attention to – how does it
embody in its construction a

00:09:21.136 --> 00:09:26.139
mode of perception,
a way of seeing?

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:32.365
How has Williams organized this
language on the page,

00:09:32.365 --> 00:09:34.879
by what principles?
 

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:40.313
Looking at it,
well, as I suggested before,

00:09:40.313 --> 00:09:45.617
it's not a poem,
I think, that we begin by

00:09:45.617 --> 00:09:49.399
hearing,
and we have to start reading it

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:53.931
and seeing it before we can even
think about how to really speak

00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:58.060
it properly.
It is not a metrical poem.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.560
This is not iambic pentameter.
 

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.840
It is a free verse poem.
 

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:12.416
In the prologue to Kora In
Hell, which is the prose I

00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:19.350
asked you to read for today at
the back of the book,

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:28.299
there are a number of sentences
and ideas that are important.

00:10:28.299 --> 00:10:31.039
I'll call attention to just a
few.

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:34.124
On page 958,
Williams says,

00:10:34.124 --> 00:10:37.920
"Nothing is good save the new.
 

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.539
 
 

00:10:41.539 --> 00:10:45.786
If a thing have novelty,
it stands intrinsically beside

00:10:45.786 --> 00:10:49.090
every other work of artistic
excellence.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.259
If it have not that,
no loveliness or heroic

00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:55.429
proportion or grand manner will
save it."

00:10:55.429 --> 00:11:01.205
And he identifies here,
as elsewhere,

00:11:01.205 --> 00:11:11.313
this property of novelty with a
kind of verse that eschews rhyme

00:11:11.313 --> 00:11:16.716
and meter,
a whole host of existing poetic

00:11:16.716 --> 00:11:22.936
conventions.
Again, in the head note to the

00:11:22.936 --> 00:11:29.955
Williams selection,
there's a quotation from

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:39.421
Williams on the subject of meter
on page 285 from his prose

00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:44.210
statement,
"The Poem as a Field of Action."

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.754
He says:
I propose sweeping

00:11:46.754 --> 00:11:51.210
changes from top to bottom of
the poetic structure….

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.257
I say we are through with the
iambic pentameter as presently

00:11:55.257 --> 00:11:58.070
conceived, at least for dramatic
verse;

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.308
through with the measured
quatrain, the staid

00:12:01.308 --> 00:12:04.474
concatenation of sounds in the
usual stanza,

00:12:04.474 --> 00:12:09.572
the sonnet.
So much for "The Silken Tent,"

00:12:09.572 --> 00:12:14.309
Hart Crane, Wallace Stevens,
et cetera.

00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:20.246
Williams is insisting that
modern verse,

00:12:20.246 --> 00:12:29.531
the kind of verse he describes,
has to break with these models

00:12:29.531 --> 00:12:38.360
and has to proceed by patterns
that it itself invents.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:47.039
Free verse is in that sense
Williams's chosen medium;

00:12:47.039 --> 00:12:53.114
free verse meaning a poem not
patterned by metrical scheme or

00:12:53.114 --> 00:12:58.378
rhyme, or indeed some other,
in a sense, pre-existing

00:12:58.378 --> 00:13:00.909
principle or pattern.
 

00:13:00.909 --> 00:13:04.719
Nonetheless,
free verse does always have

00:13:04.719 --> 00:13:10.188
some kind of operative pattern,
sometimes very strict and

00:13:10.188 --> 00:13:15.315
structuring ones,
and this short poem is a good

00:13:15.315 --> 00:13:18.824
example.
In fact, as you examine it,

00:13:18.824 --> 00:13:23.840
you see a series of four
stanzas, four two-line groups

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:29.422
– since Williams might not
like the word "stanza" – four

00:13:29.422 --> 00:13:35.749
two-line groups.
And the pattern is long-short,

00:13:35.749 --> 00:13:41.679
three or four syllables
followed by two.

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:51.669
And this is itself almost like
a metrical or rhyme scheme.

00:13:51.669 --> 00:13:55.803
In fact, you could say this
poem is more strict than a

00:13:55.803 --> 00:14:00.562
sonnet, that it's more limited
in the range of choices that it

00:14:00.562 --> 00:14:03.860
allows.
It isn't, however,

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:11.861
presented to us as sonnets are,
as an instance of a received

00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:19.862
verse form that is at least in
its general pattern invariant

00:14:19.862 --> 00:14:23.659
and again pre-existing.
 

00:14:23.659 --> 00:14:28.711
Instead, the poem presents
itself as a kind of ad-hoc

00:14:28.711 --> 00:14:33.764
arrangement, as a kind of
structure that the poet has

00:14:33.764 --> 00:14:39.397
chosen to work within,
reflecting the contingencies of

00:14:39.397 --> 00:14:44.110
this moment, the occasion,
the poem's purpose.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:50.713
The poem's shape – and this
is one reason it's hard to

00:14:50.713 --> 00:14:57.916
speak, it's hard to hear –
organizes Williams's speech in a

00:14:57.916 --> 00:15:05.360
manner that disregards or
disrupts normal familiar syntax.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:14.179
It does so specifically through
enjambment, by carrying one line

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:16.840
over to the next.
 

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:23.146
Williams's enjambments have
here, as throughout his poetry,

00:15:23.146 --> 00:15:28.909
the effect of breaking up
language: breaking it up;

00:15:28.909 --> 00:15:33.309
forcing us to,
in fact, slow down our reading;

00:15:33.309 --> 00:15:38.950
to stop taking language's
sense-making for granted;

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:44.299
and, in a sense,
to get into the poem.

00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:48.935
The white space in a Williams's
poem is--you can think of it as

00:15:48.935 --> 00:15:53.664
a space for thought,
a space where we are invited,

00:15:53.664 --> 00:15:57.918
allowed, required to think
about choices,

00:15:57.918 --> 00:16:04.193
to ask ourselves about what
possible connections can be made

00:16:04.193 --> 00:16:06.639
at a given moment.
 

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:11.668
In this poem Williams
specifically breaks words up

00:16:11.668 --> 00:16:15.669
into their component parts –
wheel,

00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:20.272
barrow, rain,
water – without hyphens,

00:16:20.272 --> 00:16:26.527
as if what he was looking at
– a red wheelbarrow –

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:31.720
consisted of those three terms:
redness,

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.409
the wheel, the barrow.
 

00:16:34.409 --> 00:16:38.669
These are its component
elements.

00:16:38.669 --> 00:16:42.931
He points out,
in effect, in this device,

00:16:42.931 --> 00:16:48.898
how in this case two nouns that
are made of compounds –

00:16:48.898 --> 00:16:54.545
they're really compounds –
represent things that are

00:16:54.545 --> 00:16:58.534
compounds,
things that are made up of

00:16:58.534 --> 00:17:01.169
other things that have parts.
 

00:17:01.169 --> 00:17:06.599
As he establishes this pattern,
"so much depends / upon / a red

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:10.539
wheel / barrow / glazed with
rain / water,"

00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:13.579
you want to carry it forward,
don't you – now that we've

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:16.299
learned what he's doing – into
the next stanza,

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:22.160
'beside the white / chickens,"
as if "white chickens" were the

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.386
same kind of compound as
"rainwater" and "red

00:17:26.386 --> 00:17:30.573
wheelbarrow."
But they're not quite,

00:17:30.573 --> 00:17:35.099
and Williams is,
in a way, teasing us.

00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:38.263
White chickens aren't made up
of "white"-ness and

00:17:38.263 --> 00:17:42.348
"chicken"-ness in the same way
that a wheelbarrow is made up of

00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:44.259
a "wheel" and a "barrow."
 

00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:48.930
He's doing something a little
different here.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:53.656
No sooner has he,
in effect, established a

00:17:53.656 --> 00:18:00.226
certain pattern of cognition –
showed us how to read his

00:18:00.226 --> 00:18:05.760
enjambments – than he breaks
that pattern.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.799
He revises how it works.
 

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:12.930
It's just been put in place and
now it's changed and in fact

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.540
it's over, it's done.
 

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.549
The poem is done.
 

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:24.357
If the first lines of the poem
and the first stanzas are,

00:18:24.357 --> 00:18:31.650
in a sense, made to interrupt
and disrupt and thereby freshen

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:37.590
our habits of seeing,
to make us see these things in

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:41.845
some new way,
this last stanza does away with

00:18:41.845 --> 00:18:46.486
the habit of seeing that the
poem itself has just

00:18:46.486 --> 00:18:50.250
constructed,
just introduced us to.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:55.490
Williams prevents us from
settling into a convention of

00:18:55.490 --> 00:19:01.603
perception, even in a poem that
is as small and as brief as this

00:19:01.603 --> 00:19:04.918
one.
There's really only enough time

00:19:04.918 --> 00:19:09.257
in the poem's essentially
introduction and three parts

00:19:09.257 --> 00:19:13.269
following to establish a pattern
and break it.

00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:21.150
What this brief moment of
heightened perception allows us

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:28.750
to see, to experience,
is something small and large.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:33.099
What is it that depends on the
red wheelbarrow?

00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:40.180
Williams only says "so much,"
"so much."

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.021
The idea is,
I think, the beautiful one that

00:19:44.021 --> 00:19:49.203
the world, when it's glazed with
rain water--it's a kind of

00:19:49.203 --> 00:19:52.300
aesthetic effect,
an aesthetic effect that

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.402
implies a light that does the
glazing, that's somewhere behind

00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:59.066
our shoulders and the poet's,
as he looks at these objects,

00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:03.490
this light, which comes after
rain and is a product of change,

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:07.509
of the energy of the world as
it transforms;

00:20:07.509 --> 00:20:14.607
suddenly allows this world to
be seen in visible detail,

00:20:14.607 --> 00:20:19.640
apprehensible in its component
parts;

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:27.896
and the ordinary gestalt
of perception is interrupted,

00:20:27.896 --> 00:20:31.750
freshened and re-oriented.
 

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.555
We see something,
something ordinary,

00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:37.670
newly and freshly.
 

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:42.142
It stands out.
And what we see in miniature in

00:20:42.142 --> 00:20:46.619
the limited space of the moment,
or of the poem,

00:20:46.619 --> 00:20:53.782
is a world, well,
what we see is the elements out

00:20:53.782 --> 00:21:00.524
of which the world is made,
elements ordinarily held in a

00:21:00.524 --> 00:21:05.020
kind of complex mutual
dependency: a kind of complex of

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.099
relations that we simply take
for granted in the words that we

00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:13.680
use and in the way that we see
things,

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.246
just as we put together "wheel"
and "barrow" and "rain" and

00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:21.160
"water," without thinking about
it.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:26.716
What the red wheelbarrow holds,
then, and what in that sense

00:21:26.716 --> 00:21:30.390
depends on it is something
pretty heavy,

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.440
and that is the sense of a
whole world;

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:40.751
or better, the sense of the
world in its wholeness,

00:21:40.751 --> 00:21:47.694
which is something affirmed in
this attractively modest,

00:21:47.694 --> 00:21:51.859
momentary, poetic perception.
 

00:21:51.859 --> 00:21:55.500
So much for "The Red
Wheelbarrow."

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:01.427
Spring and All:
and there's that idea again,

00:22:01.427 --> 00:22:06.524
in the title,
spring as a season of newness:

00:22:06.524 --> 00:22:10.407
for Williams,
beginning his career,

00:22:10.407 --> 00:22:14.765
spring registering his own
beginnings, registering

00:22:14.765 --> 00:22:20.020
modernness,
a vision of the world in its

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:23.776
newness.
Well, Spring and All is

00:22:23.776 --> 00:22:27.394
a beautiful book,
and one I wish I could show

00:22:27.394 --> 00:22:29.516
you,
but the last time I saw it at

00:22:29.516 --> 00:22:32.769
the Beinecke it disappeared and
no one has seen it in a couple

00:22:32.769 --> 00:22:35.955
of years.
They have a lot of paper over

00:22:35.955 --> 00:22:38.441
there.
I guess it's easy to lose

00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:41.286
things.
Maybe it's available again,

00:22:41.286 --> 00:22:42.950
we'll look and see.
 

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:49.569
It's a beautiful,
plain book, robin's egg blue

00:22:49.569 --> 00:22:53.100
for spring, I suppose.
 

00:22:53.100 --> 00:23:00.980
It seems--it's not large;
it's small.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.390
It almost has no ornament.
 

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.797
In all of this,
it seems to exemplify the

00:23:08.797 --> 00:23:15.630
American virtues of plainness
and directness and simplicity;

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:19.049
again, a long way from Hart
Crane.

00:23:19.049 --> 00:23:24.750
And the book is really so
American that it was published

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:28.418
in Dijon.
Williams is a polemically

00:23:28.418 --> 00:23:32.970
American poet,
even more than Crane in certain

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.929
ways,
more than Frost even,

00:23:35.929 --> 00:23:41.970
and yet Williams has a very
important and vital relationship

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:48.420
to European modernism and to
French modernism in particular,

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:53.069
and more particularly to French
painting.

00:23:53.069 --> 00:23:57.919
And to understand how Williams
is writing, what he's trying to

00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:02.529
get at, it's helpful to remember
what he was looking at.

00:24:02.529 --> 00:24:07.799
Here's a Braque,
Georges Braque,

00:24:07.799 --> 00:24:11.694
1908.
It's on the way to cubism and,

00:24:11.694 --> 00:24:16.833
I think, sort of helpfully on
the way to cubism because it

00:24:16.833 --> 00:24:20.980
looks back to a realist
tradition with its,

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:26.643
in a sense, conventional,
perspectival space that's yet

00:24:26.643 --> 00:24:33.857
being broken up into planes,
that allow us to register the

00:24:33.857 --> 00:24:39.467
painting as a painting,
that force us to,

00:24:39.467 --> 00:24:43.772
really.
And I suppose even more

00:24:43.772 --> 00:24:49.703
striking is this:
one of many great late Cezanne

00:24:49.703 --> 00:24:56.140
paintings of Le Mont
Sainte-Victoire where here,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:04.611
again, the perspectival space
of the painting is being turned

00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:12.660
into almost a kind of abstract
field of color patterns.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:17.470
Again, these are painters
interested in foregrounding

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:22.279
their action of seeing through
the ways in which they

00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:27.737
foreground self-consciously the
materiality of the medium in

00:25:27.737 --> 00:25:30.420
which they are working.
 

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:36.434
The aim in postimpressionist
painting, and then in cubism,

00:25:36.434 --> 00:25:41.711
really, is to again break up
that gestalt of

00:25:41.711 --> 00:25:47.198
perception that Williams is also
opposing himself to:

00:25:47.198 --> 00:25:52.070
to break it up and grasp,
in some sense,

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:58.128
the dynamism in the world
before us, precisely through

00:25:58.128 --> 00:26:04.301
acts of seeing that call
attention to themselves and to

00:26:04.301 --> 00:26:09.559
the way in which that seeing is
rendered.

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:14.812
If you have read the prologue
to Kora in Hell,

00:26:14.812 --> 00:26:21.586
which starts on page 954,
you know that Williams begins

00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:29.680
with an anecdote about Marcel
Duchamp, part of the New York

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:37.355
art world that Williams also
participated in through his

00:26:37.355 --> 00:26:41.232
friend,
the dealer and taste maker

00:26:41.232 --> 00:26:45.128
Walter Arensberg:
"Once when I was taking lunch

00:26:45.128 --> 00:26:50.379
with Walter Arensberg… I asked
him if he could state what the

00:26:50.379 --> 00:26:54.783
more modern painters were
about…" And then he gives

00:26:54.783 --> 00:26:58.845
several as examples,
including Duchamp,

00:26:58.845 --> 00:27:02.890
all of whom were then in New
York, and:

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:05.766
[Arensberg]
replied by saying that the only

00:27:05.766 --> 00:27:08.882
way man differed from every
other creature was in his

00:27:08.882 --> 00:27:11.099
ability to improvise novelty
and,

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:13.278
since the pictorial artist was
under discussion,

00:27:13.278 --> 00:27:15.039
anything in paint that is truly
new,

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:18.079
truly a fresh creation is good
art.

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:21.588
Thus, according to Duchamp,
who was Arensberg's champion at

00:27:21.588 --> 00:27:25.036
the time, a stained glassed
window that had fallen out and

00:27:25.036 --> 00:27:28.423
lay more or less together on the
ground was a far greater

00:27:28.423 --> 00:27:31.568
interest than the thing
conventionally composed in

00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:37.202
situ.
Which is an interesting model

00:27:37.202 --> 00:27:45.980
for what Williams himself might
be seen as doing in poetry,

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.993
that in some sense he's taking
the stained glass window and

00:27:48.993 --> 00:27:53.589
seeing it laid out on the floor,
maybe broken on the floor.

00:27:53.589 --> 00:28:00.170
Duchamp painted this famous
work, Nude Descending a

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:05.260
Staircase,
and it is clearly all about

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:12.834
here rendering in pictorial form
the kind of multiframe vision

00:28:12.834 --> 00:28:20.160
that photography and motion
pictures allow us to see,

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:26.747
to again here grasp in
representation some sense of the

00:28:26.747 --> 00:28:34.920
movement and energy that compose
the world that we see before us.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:42.632
The other dimension of the
Duchamp anecdote that's nice,

00:28:42.632 --> 00:28:49.303
and about Williams is telling,
is that a stained glass window

00:28:49.303 --> 00:28:53.380
that has fallen out is something
you come upon or find.

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:58.463
And Duchamp is,
of course, most famous for his

00:28:58.463 --> 00:29:04.789
– let me turn to the next
image – his ready-mades.

00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:12.695
This a facsimile of the--or
that is another version of his

00:29:12.695 --> 00:29:21.293
most famous ready-made fountain,
a urinal, which he signed with

00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:23.512
the pseudonym,
R.

00:29:23.512 --> 00:29:30.170
Mutt 1917, and presented as a
work of art.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:36.890
The Art Gallery has this work.
 

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:41.119
This too is,
as it were, a facsimile of the

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:44.443
original, now lost:
a snow shovel,

00:29:44.443 --> 00:29:50.015
another ready-made;
this one with the excellent

00:29:50.015 --> 00:29:55.319
title, In Advance of the
Broken Arm.

00:29:55.319 --> 00:30:02.444
Duchamp takes postimpressionism
to New York in the form of dada

00:30:02.444 --> 00:30:08.190
– a movement with its
importance for Williams,

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.312
too, including,
I think, Duchamp's

00:30:11.312 --> 00:30:15.949
mischievousness and his
willingness to provoke the

00:30:15.949 --> 00:30:20.964
subversive – to take
Williams's word – and to play

00:30:20.964 --> 00:30:25.789
with expectations about what
constitutes art,

00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:30.118
as Williams in certain ways
would play with our expectations

00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:34.299
about what could constitute a
poem or poetic statement.

00:30:34.299 --> 00:30:40.446
In New York and elsewhere,
Williams is in contact with a

00:30:40.446 --> 00:30:46.481
whole range of modernist
American artists influenced by

00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:52.069
the European art I've just been
talking about,

00:30:52.069 --> 00:30:58.390
but also working in a
distinctively American mode.

00:30:58.390 --> 00:31:05.609
This is a work by Charles
Demuth, 1921.

00:31:05.609 --> 00:31:08.838
I'm sorry, I'm behind on
producing my image lists but

00:31:08.838 --> 00:31:10.390
I'll get those for you.
 

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:13.380
And here's another.
 

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.110
And again here:
an urban scene,

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:25.680
that is realist in its mode of
representation,

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:32.474
and yet the foregrounding of
the lines created by the

00:31:32.474 --> 00:31:39.660
different shapes of the
buildings call attention to this

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:47.500
as indeed a kind of constructed
image that seems to be moving

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:55.209
out of the realm of realist
representation to something more

00:31:55.209 --> 00:32:03.309
symbolic and certainly avowedly
created by the artist.

00:32:03.309 --> 00:32:09.829
Demuth goes further in the same
direction in what is probably

00:32:09.829 --> 00:32:12.220
his best known work.
 

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.950
This is called The Great
Figure Number 5.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:24.883
If Williams was busy looking at
these artists I've just been

00:32:24.883 --> 00:32:29.609
talking about,
they also were looking at him,

00:32:29.609 --> 00:32:36.232
and Demuth's painting is a
tribute to Williams and a little

00:32:36.232 --> 00:32:38.416
homage;
also, I think,

00:32:38.416 --> 00:32:43.287
a little joke about Williams's
own poem, also from Spring

00:32:43.287 --> 00:32:48.490
and All, that we know as
"The Great Figure" on page 291.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:52.860
 
 

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:59.330
Well, I'll read this;
again, rain and light:

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.420
Among the rain
and lights

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.680
I saw the figure 5
in gold

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.320
on a red firetruck
moving

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.540
with weight and urgency
tense

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.090
unheeded
to gong clangs

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.010
siren howls
and wheels rumbling

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:22.786
through the dark city.
And this is Demuth's rendering

00:33:22.786 --> 00:33:31.059
of that moment that draws out
the way in which the poem finds

00:33:31.059 --> 00:33:39.470
and makes an exalted symbol from
this ordinary perception,

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:45.279
and it's got "Bill" up top,
and "W.C.W." down in the

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:52.342
bottom, and "Carlos" underneath
the 5, as part of this friendly

00:33:52.342 --> 00:33:56.133
tribute.
The poem's interesting to look

00:33:56.133 --> 00:33:58.880
at next to "The Red
Wheelbarrow."

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.450
Here's something else that's
red, right?

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:07.658
And again, the poem is
concerned with a moment of

00:34:07.658 --> 00:34:12.603
perception.
Here, the poem really tries to

00:34:12.603 --> 00:34:18.260
render the process by which
perception takes place,

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.527
or rather the kind of context
in which it does,

00:34:20.527 --> 00:34:22.400
which "The Red Wheelbarrow"
doesn't.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.545
"The Red Wheelbarrow" really
kind of takes something seen,

00:34:26.545 --> 00:34:30.517
almost fragmented,
out of a continuum of

00:34:30.517 --> 00:34:37.471
perception that we can feel
implied but isn't made explicit

00:34:37.471 --> 00:34:40.747
in the poem.
In this case,

00:34:40.747 --> 00:34:46.884
we are given the kind of
context out of which a detail,

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:51.998
something arbitrary,
contingent, and ordinary,

00:34:51.998 --> 00:34:56.585
springs out;
springs out of the rush of

00:34:56.585 --> 00:35:01.997
things and catches the eye and
the imagination and the

00:35:01.997 --> 00:35:04.550
intention of the poet.
 

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:09.395
"In a Station of the Metro" is
a poem about metropolitan,

00:35:09.395 --> 00:35:11.040
urban perception.
 

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.349
So, is this poem.
 

00:35:13.349 --> 00:35:19.445
Here, instead of a present
moment that's briefly suspended,

00:35:19.445 --> 00:35:24.489
as in Pound's poem or as in "So
Much Depends,"

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:31.334
this poem is just as much about
memory in the rush of ongoing

00:35:31.334 --> 00:35:38.521
experience, of a kind of ongoing
temporality figured here by the

00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:45.480
firetruck "moving" – and
there's that participial word,

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.849
"moving" – a kind of ongoing
action.

00:35:48.849 --> 00:35:53.918
In the midst of this,
something catches the poet's

00:35:53.918 --> 00:36:00.010
attention.
He acts as a perceiver.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:06.271
He says "I saw" in that action,
expressed in a verb in the past

00:36:06.271 --> 00:36:10.542
tense;
intervenes in and cuts into

00:36:10.542 --> 00:36:17.596
this blurry, perceptual,
participial flow of things that

00:36:17.596 --> 00:36:21.699
is the fire truck rushing by.
 

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:27.007
It fixes on a figure,
in this case a number,

00:36:27.007 --> 00:36:33.179
and carries that away and out
of the experience.

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:39.697
That "5" on the fire truck,
it's something utterly ordinary

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:44.754
like a wheelbarrow or a shovel,
a snow shovel,

00:36:44.754 --> 00:36:48.800
and it's a kind of found
object.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:55.410
And yet here for Williams--he
makes something of it,

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:02.150
or plays with the act of making
something with it.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:06.746
It is something he calls,
with some joking,

00:37:06.746 --> 00:37:10.686
some seriousness,
"the great figure":

00:37:10.686 --> 00:37:13.860
a great figure,
a symbol.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.579
But a symbol of what exactly?
 

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:23.675
Well, perhaps a symbol of the
very capacity of the ordinary to

00:37:23.675 --> 00:37:29.771
arrest our attention and become
significant, become objects of

00:37:29.771 --> 00:37:34.439
perception;
perhaps a symbol of the five

00:37:34.439 --> 00:37:36.590
senses themselves.
 

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:39.200
What do you think?
 

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.019
That seems possible, too.
 

00:37:43.019 --> 00:37:49.146
The five senses whose powers
are behind, for Williams,

00:37:49.146 --> 00:37:53.769
the way we create figurative
language,

00:37:53.769 --> 00:38:00.847
the way we create figures and
poems and discover symbols and

00:38:00.847 --> 00:38:07.804
discover meaning in the world
around us: "Now life is above

00:38:07.804 --> 00:38:15.122
all things else at any moment
subversive of life as it was the

00:38:15.122 --> 00:38:20.760
moment before – always new,
irregular."

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:26.239
The poem that's placed just
after this in the anthology is

00:38:26.239 --> 00:38:29.699
one of Williams's greatest and
it,

00:38:29.699 --> 00:38:34.601
too, as it appears in the
volume Spring and All has

00:38:34.601 --> 00:38:39.847
no title but is given a title
here – the title of the volume

00:38:39.847 --> 00:38:45.007
itself – but was known rather
for a long time simply by its

00:38:45.007 --> 00:38:50.655
first line,
"By the road to the contagious

00:38:50.655 --> 00:38:54.834
hospital."
The poem is about the continual

00:38:54.834 --> 00:38:59.014
newness that Williams calls
life, something that's

00:38:59.014 --> 00:39:03.110
continually constructing the
world around us.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:07.436
And the poet in this poem gets
at it – like the

00:39:07.436 --> 00:39:12.927
postimpressionist painter,
even perhaps like the dadaist

00:39:12.927 --> 00:39:17.941
– by calling his and our
attention to the act of

00:39:17.941 --> 00:39:22.816
constructing his poem,
and in particular as that

00:39:22.816 --> 00:39:27.543
construction is felt,
as it's kind of brought to our

00:39:27.543 --> 00:39:30.880
consciousness through
enjambment.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.402
Williams's poetry,
like the world he sees,

00:39:36.402 --> 00:39:44.079
is constantly enjambed,
segmented, renewed by that act.

00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:47.820
Let's look at how enjambment
works here.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.950
By the road to the
contagious hospital

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.820
under the surge of the blue
mottled clouds driven from the

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.450
northeast--a cold wind.
 

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:02.360
Beyond, the
waste of broad, muddy fields

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.090
brown with dried weeds,
standing and fallen

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:11.870
patches of standing water
the scattering of tall trees

00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:16.421
All along the road the reddish
purplish, forked,

00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:20.769
upstanding, twiggy
stuff of bushes and small trees

00:40:20.769 --> 00:40:23.160
with dead, brown leaves under
them

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.653
leafless vines --
Lifeless [again,

00:40:27.653 --> 00:40:30.792
dead]
in appearance,

00:40:30.792 --> 00:40:35.500
sluggish
dazed spring approaches [that

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.989
is the first verb in the poem]
–

00:40:38.989 --> 00:40:43.666
They [he now says,
suggesting all of these things]

00:40:43.666 --> 00:40:51.130
enter the new world
naked, cold, uncertain of all

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.969
save that they enter.
 

00:40:52.969 --> 00:40:57.210
All about them [these things,
the things of the

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:59.480
world]
the cold, familiar wind --

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.793
Now the grass, tomorrow
the stiff curl of wildcarrot

00:41:03.793 --> 00:41:07.125
leaf
One by one objects are defined

00:41:07.125 --> 00:41:10.480
[like a series of Imagist
poems]--

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:16.773
It [now not "they" but "it,"
which is again now here a world

00:41:16.773 --> 00:41:19.295
felt in its
wholeness]

00:41:19.295 --> 00:41:23.270
quickens: clarity,
outline of leaf

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:27.579
But now the stark dignity of
entrance-- Still,

00:41:27.579 --> 00:41:31.650
the profound change
has come upon them: rooted, they

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:34.480
grip down and begin to
awaken.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:41.782
It's a great poem,
and enjambment is a key part of

00:41:41.782 --> 00:41:46.272
its energy.
The first enjambment that is

00:41:46.272 --> 00:41:51.559
striking, is bold – it's one
of the really famous ones,

00:41:51.559 --> 00:41:56.320
in fact, in modern poetry –
is that second line,

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.429
"under the surge of the blue."
 

00:41:59.429 --> 00:42:04.279
It invites us to read "the
blue" as a noun,

00:42:04.279 --> 00:42:08.320
and to feel and hear that
phrase,

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.054
"the surge of the blue," as a
kind of conventional expression

00:42:13.054 --> 00:42:15.500
of lyric romantic exaltation.
 

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:20.317
But we're wrong.
"Blue" is an adjective,

00:42:20.317 --> 00:42:26.833
and we learn this as the poem
turns and the enjambment

00:42:26.833 --> 00:42:32.119
supplies the information that
this blue,

00:42:32.119 --> 00:42:39.027
this kind of exalted thing is
actually "mottled," marred or

00:42:39.027 --> 00:42:42.599
flawed, even,
in some sense.

00:42:42.599 --> 00:42:50.130
And here the newness that the
poem is going to celebrate is

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:57.659
going to be something we might
feel mottled – that is,

00:42:57.659 --> 00:43:03.102
cold, flawed – which is part
of its claim to be new,

00:43:03.102 --> 00:43:08.750
part of its claim to represent
something really real;

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:13.222
not to be found in previous
books of poetry,

00:43:13.222 --> 00:43:17.590
but something to be found in
the living.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:22.280
So, at this moment it seems
enjambment means

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:27.079
disestablishment,
that word of Williams's,

00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:32.602
the subversion of life as it
just was, a surprise of

00:43:32.602 --> 00:43:35.702
perception.
But as in "The Red

00:43:35.702 --> 00:43:41.248
Wheelbarrow," if you think we've
now learned what enjambment

00:43:41.248 --> 00:43:45.760
means in a given context,
Williams is going to do

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:51.269
something else.
The next lines are also sharply

00:43:51.269 --> 00:43:58.293
enjambed: "mottled clouds driven
from the / northeast--a cold

00:43:58.293 --> 00:44:01.938
wind.
Beyond, the / waste of broad,

00:44:01.938 --> 00:44:06.227
muddy fields."
That is itself a bold thing to

00:44:06.227 --> 00:44:10.655
have done in poetry,
to break off a line at the

00:44:10.655 --> 00:44:12.579
definite article.
 

00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:18.190
I'm not sure that there's an
example in poetry previously to

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:23.230
align these examples of lines
ending in "the" with.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:28.971
There may well be,
but it's yet a novel and bold

00:44:28.971 --> 00:44:32.269
thing for Williams to do.
 

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:40.020
But it works differently from
the previous example where the

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:47.639
"blue" invited us to read that
phrase as a kind of noun,

00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:51.535
expressive of romantic
exaltation, and then gave us the

00:44:51.535 --> 00:44:55.070
surprise that no,
it doesn't function that way,

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:59.648
and what you thought was pure
and exalted is in fact mottled

00:44:59.648 --> 00:45:02.977
and messy.
These enjambments don't have

00:45:02.977 --> 00:45:06.829
any kind of interpretive
surprise like that.

00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:09.909
The lines are just broken that
way.

00:45:09.909 --> 00:45:14.757
They don't change how we read
the grammar of the phrases,

00:45:14.757 --> 00:45:19.000
they don't force us to recast
our expectations.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.896
Together, though,
as a series of enjambments,

00:45:21.896 --> 00:45:25.450
these lines evoke a state in
which the world is freshly

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:29.199
taking shape,
coming at us in forms that we

00:45:29.199 --> 00:45:33.369
have to confront,
that give us abrupt insistent

00:45:33.369 --> 00:45:37.159
impressions,
which are sometimes full of

00:45:37.159 --> 00:45:39.590
meaning and sometimes not.
 

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:43.705
The way Williams is
constructing this poem is a

00:45:43.705 --> 00:45:48.626
poetic version of the action
that the poem's describing:

00:45:48.626 --> 00:45:53.190
the going forward into spring
against the cold,

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:58.188
through which eventually,
one by one, objects are

00:45:58.188 --> 00:46:01.530
defined;
defined and organized and

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:05.579
energized and animated as
Williams sees it.

00:46:05.579 --> 00:46:12.026
As I say, the verb does not
come in the poem until we see

00:46:12.026 --> 00:46:17.422
that phrase "spring approaches,"
almost at the middle or

00:46:17.422 --> 00:46:20.000
slightly beyond the middle of
the poem.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.083
And then there is that next
sentence, "they enter the new

00:46:25.083 --> 00:46:28.532
world naked":
"they" being deliberately

00:46:28.532 --> 00:46:32.528
vague,
evoking the things of the world

00:46:32.528 --> 00:46:37.709
but in a humanized way,
a humanized way as we come to

00:46:37.709 --> 00:46:40.300
feel them and see them.
 

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.690
They enter the world just as we
do, naked.

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:49.599
And we re-enter it naked with
them, you could say.

00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:55.764
This is a poem about emergence
that identifies modern poetry

00:46:55.764 --> 00:46:59.936
– modern verse,
as Williams calls it in his

00:46:59.936 --> 00:47:05.038
letter to Monroe – identifies
modern verse with the process by

00:47:05.038 --> 00:47:08.440
which the perceptual world takes
shape,

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:14.110
grips down, rooting itself in
ordinary fact and things,

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:21.039
and from which a kind of energy
is drawn and we begin to awaken.

00:47:21.039 --> 00:47:27.389
This is probably a good place
to end.

00:47:27.389 --> 00:47:34.728
I want to stress the resonance
and suggestiveness of Williams's

00:47:34.728 --> 00:47:38.280
investment in what is naked.
 

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:44.849
It's a way of envisioning the
world in its primary terms.

00:47:44.849 --> 00:47:51.259
It's also a way of calling
forth a kind of human energy

00:47:51.259 --> 00:47:57.194
that is primary and again,
as Williams imagines it,

00:47:57.194 --> 00:48:01.309
modern.
And here he is in the buff;

00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:07.434
I guess, skinny dipping in New
Jersey with a couple of sticks

00:48:07.434 --> 00:48:09.679
to pretend he's Pan.
 

00:48:09.679 --> 00:48:15.351
So, go enjoy the spring day,
keep your clothes on,

00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:21.370
and we'll talk about maybe a
little more Williams but

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:26.000
definitely Marianne Moore next
time.

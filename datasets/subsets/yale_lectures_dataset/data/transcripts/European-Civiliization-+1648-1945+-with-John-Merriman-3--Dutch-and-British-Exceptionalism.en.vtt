00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.960
Prof: We talked about
different political outcomes.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.290
Over the long run,
Great Britain remains a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.557
constitutional monarchy;
even in the nineteenth century,

00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:21.681
when Victoria had great
prestige, she did not have great

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:22.520
power.
 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.358
The Netherlands also resisted
absolutism, and the Dutch

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:29.130
Republic remained the Dutch
Republic;

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.424
although, for reasons that
we'll see later,

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:37.288
the Dutch Republic ceases to be
a great power in the eighteenth

00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:38.230
century.
 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.688
Given the very different route
that Prussia,

00:00:41.688 --> 00:00:43.860
Austria, Russia,
Sweden,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.780
and France went with a
centralization of absolute rule,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.369
why did it work out so
differently for England/Britain

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:57.690
and the Netherlands?
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.033
Again, this is the second and
last of these sort of holding

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.130
pattern lectures.
 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.989
This parallels exactly what you
are reading.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.555
Again, until we get our class
set and all that,

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:14.518
then there will be a very
different kind of lecture

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:17.000
starting next Monday.
 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.418
But let's just think out loud
about what these places had in

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:21.903
common,
and what this tells you about

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:26.480
social structure and political
outcomes in early modern Europe.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.177
Of course, the consequences are
enormous for other kinds of

00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:30.879
outcomes.
 

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.260
Let me give you an example.
 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.709
Germany is not unified until
1871.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:39.989
Ironically, unification
proclaimed in the Hall of

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:44.090
Mirrors at the Château of
Versailles, which we'll visit

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.209
for a few seconds later on.
 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:49.495
The fact that German
unification was achieved by

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:53.129
Prussia and that Prussia was
dominated by nobles,

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:56.280
who were called Junkers,
you'll come to them later,

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.132
and by an army which--the state
basically was an appendage of

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:05.906
the army--had rather enormous
consequences for Europe in the

00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:10.680
late nineteenth and above all in
the twentieth century.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.840
In the 1960s and 1970s people
paid a lot more attention to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.280
social structure and class
analysis.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.019
But when you look at the
experience of Britain and the

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.400
Dutch Republic,
they do share things that,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.383
in a way, determine the kind of
political economy that they

00:02:32.383 --> 00:02:33.500
would have.
 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.280
What are some of these things?
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.400
I've written them on the board.
 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.740
Let's just start in that order
and think aloud.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.324
Then what I'm going to do for
the last twenty or twenty-five

00:02:47.324 --> 00:02:49.210
minutes is talk about the Dutch
Republic.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.030
You can skip that part in the
reading,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.353
which isn't very long,
and illustrate with some

00:02:54.353 --> 00:02:56.330
paintings,
for which you are not

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.619
responsible,
but just to make the points I

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:01.688
want to make about the nature of
the Dutch Republic,

00:03:01.688 --> 00:03:07.520
and in which you'll see ways in
which it was very similar to

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.650
England/Great Britain and very
different in terms of France.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.508
First of all,
it's not a coincidence that in

00:03:17.508 --> 00:03:20.430
both England and in the Dutch
Republic you had,

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.688
along with the city-states of
Northern Italy,

00:03:24.688 --> 00:03:29.174
you had the largest percentage
of middle-class population that

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:31.158
you could find in Europe.
 

00:03:31.158 --> 00:03:34.954
The middle class in Russia,
which I'll talk about on

00:03:34.954 --> 00:03:37.930
Monday, was just absolutely
miniscule.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.919
The middle class was extremely
small in Prussia.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.799
Prussia did not include the
Hanseatic League cities,

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.008
such as Bremen and Hamburg and
the others.

00:03:51.008 --> 00:03:57.133
You have in the Netherlands and
in England an astonishingly

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:59.348
large middle class.
 

00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:05.495
Moreover, in the case of
England, there was tremendous

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.508
fluidity between elites.
 

00:04:08.508 --> 00:04:12.793
The percentage of the
population who was noble,

00:04:12.793 --> 00:04:16.889
who had noble titles,
was extremely small.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:23.990
Privilege came from wealth and
wealth stemmed from the land.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.625
Yet, because of the rapid and
dramatic expansion of the

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:31.889
English role in the global
economy,

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.180
you had lots of very wealthy
landlords,

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.129
property owners investing in
commerce,

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:46.790
whereas in Spain and in France,
and Prussia in particular,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.759
it was seen to be sort of
slumming for nobles to

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.509
participate in commerce.
 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:58.839
Marxist analysis has given us
this all too rigid picture of

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:02.870
the nobility sort of letting
their nails grow long,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.220
"they are nobles because
they do nothing."

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.310
That was part of it.
 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.247
Certainly there were nobles in
France who bought up vineyards

00:05:10.247 --> 00:05:11.430
around Bordeaux.
 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.576
There are nobles around
Toulouse who have invested in

00:05:15.576 --> 00:05:17.569
commercial agriculture.
 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.432
But yet the fact remains that
it's really in England that you

00:05:23.432 --> 00:05:28.319
have this tremendous fluidity
within the elite,

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:34.935
and that basically commercial
money talks as much as

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:38.180
propertied money talks.
 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.600
London, already by the late
sixteenth century,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.857
one-sixth of all the people,
I think this is E.A. Wrigley

00:05:45.857 --> 00:05:50.723
who pointed this out a long time
ago--one-sixth of all the people

00:05:50.723 --> 00:05:54.220
in England went to London
frequently,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.029
because London was absolutely
gigantic as a city.

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.593
The only cities in Europe that
were comparable--and they were

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:03.459
smaller--were Naples,
an extraordinarily poor city,

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:07.990
and Constantinople, Istanbul,
and, of course, in Japan,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.899
Edo, which would become known
as Tokyo.

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:16.310
The percentage of the English
population that would have

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.851
considered themselves to be
middle class is extraordinarily

00:06:18.851 --> 00:06:19.290
large.
 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.350
The same is even more true in
the Netherlands.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.399
There were, to be sure,
nobles in the Netherlands.

00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:30.098
They tended to live in the
eastern part in rural

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:32.540
Netherlands and in the south.
 

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.139
But their lives and interests
were far, far away from that

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:42.660
economic large machine,
which was Amsterdam.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.069
Amsterdam is dominated by the
middle classes.

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:48.730
Now, the middle class want
political rights.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.540
They want prerogatives.
 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.459
They want their privileges for
themselves.

00:06:52.459 --> 00:06:58.752
It is fair to argue that
non-titled people in England

00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:06.012
were at the forefront of the
victorious role in the civil war

00:07:06.012 --> 00:07:09.279
that parliament played.
 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:14.901
In the city-states of Venice,
which was a major trading city

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:18.540
already on the decline,
and in Florence, and in Milan,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.906
and in Turin,
and in places like that you

00:07:20.906 --> 00:07:25.564
find something very comparable,
but Italy is not united until

00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:26.800
the 1860s.
 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.062
Northern Italy has a large
percentage of the population who

00:07:31.062 --> 00:07:32.459
are middle class.
 

00:07:32.459 --> 00:07:36.648
But in talking about the
political outcomes of states,

00:07:36.648 --> 00:07:40.519
that doesn't really fit into
our analysis here.

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:45.528
Part of that is that along with
Northern Italy,

00:07:45.528 --> 00:07:50.536
the Netherlands and
England/Great Britain have,

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:56.199
by far, the most urbanized
population in Europe.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:59.999
If you go into what now is
Serbia, there basically was

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:02.579
Belgrade, which was a small
place.

00:08:02.579 --> 00:08:08.076
Poland had very lively,
important cities,

00:08:08.076 --> 00:08:13.709
Warsaw and Krakow,
and GdaÅ„sk as well.

00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:15.769
You can't just say,
"In Eastern Europe there

00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:18.100
weren't cities,"
but there isn't any place,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.127
including France,
that had a remotely as high a

00:08:22.127 --> 00:08:26.925
percentage of the population
living in cities as England and

00:08:26.925 --> 00:08:28.470
the Netherlands.
 

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:33.157
One of the great shifts in
English/British history that you

00:08:33.157 --> 00:08:37.682
will become aware of is the
shift of economic dynamism in

00:08:37.682 --> 00:08:41.320
England away from the south to
the north.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.870
In the time we're starting this
course in the seventeenth

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.750
century, besides London,
which is this gigantic place,

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.210
the biggest cities in England
were Norwich and Exeter,

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.129
and York in the north.
 

00:08:52.129 --> 00:08:54.889
Of course, with large-scale
industrialization,

00:08:54.889 --> 00:08:58.081
which begins in the middle of
the eighteenth century,

00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:01.210
you'll see this dramatic shift
up to the north.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:05.160
Manchester, which was a small
town, becomes this enormous

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.690
city, and Liverpool becomes ever
more important.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.230
Cities are where the middle
class lives.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.787
Bourgeois and burghers,
as I said last time,

00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:18.841
are urban residents who are
losing their privileges on the

00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:21.830
continent to big-time absolute
states.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:25.470
They will defend,
quite vociferously,

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:33.375
their privileges as townspeople
against absolutist pretensions

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:37.394
of nobles,
in the case of the Netherlands

00:09:37.394 --> 00:09:39.908
and also, to an extent,
in England as well.

00:09:39.908 --> 00:09:43.056
They share those things in
common, which is not to say that

00:09:43.056 --> 00:09:45.279
a country like France wasn't
urbanized.

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:47.918
Paris is already enormous.
 

00:09:47.918 --> 00:09:51.235
There are about 500,000 people
at the time of the French

00:09:51.235 --> 00:09:52.019
Revolution.
 

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:54.086
There are so many people you
can't count, because they own

00:09:54.086 --> 00:09:54.450
nothing.
 

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:58.057
Also, we don't have accurate
censuses until the nineteenth

00:09:58.057 --> 00:09:58.690
century.
 

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.240
The first accurate census,
I think, is in Copenhagen at

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.610
the end of the eighteenth
century.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.496
Most censuses were taken,
by the way, as a way of

00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:10.264
counting heads,
the number of people who had to

00:10:10.264 --> 00:10:12.308
be fed at the time of a siege.
 

00:10:12.308 --> 00:10:17.740
We're kind of guessing on these
population figures.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.836
The fact remains that the
Netherlands and England/Britain

00:10:22.836 --> 00:10:24.019
share this.
 

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:28.230
This is important in terms of
political outcomes,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.158
and also important in the case
of England/Britain in what we've

00:10:32.158 --> 00:10:34.820
come to call the Industrial
Revolution,

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.629
which I will talk about at
another time.

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:43.499
Secondly, as I tried to suggest
the other day,

00:10:43.499 --> 00:10:47.070
these places resist absolutism.
 

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:51.182
The English Civil War,
it's kind of a generalization

00:10:51.182 --> 00:10:54.580
to underline that too much,
but nonetheless,

00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:00.710
people living in England in the
1640s saw that there was a real

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:05.950
threat to the idea of the
freeborn Englishman that was

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:11.288
coming from the trampling of
long-assumed rights,

00:11:11.288 --> 00:11:13.110
since at least the thirteenth
century,

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:19.577
at least in the imagination of
people by kings who wanted to

00:11:19.577 --> 00:11:25.606
dispense with the rights of
parliament and run things as

00:11:25.606 --> 00:11:27.690
they wanted to.
 

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.320
In the case of the Netherlands,
it's the same thing.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.677
There isn't anything as
dramatic as the English Civil

00:11:34.677 --> 00:11:37.317
War,
but the important outcome is

00:11:37.317 --> 00:11:40.755
that in the end this
decentralized federalist

00:11:40.755 --> 00:11:43.010
structure,
which I describe in the book

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.960
and we'll talk a little bit
about in a while,

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.773
is victorious over the
pretensions of a potential

00:11:48.773 --> 00:11:52.879
dynastic ruling house,
that is the Orange House,

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:56.806
the House of Orange,
who wanted to make the chief

00:11:56.806 --> 00:11:59.535
Dutch official,
who was called the

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:04.450
Stadtholder-- you can read that
in the book--and wanted to turn

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.779
that person into kind of a
thundering,

00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.610
semi-absolutist monarch.
 

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:12.000
That doesn't work as well.
 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.879
When you think of the origins
of the Netherlands,

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:21.052
it comes from a civil war,
or a war of independence

00:12:21.052 --> 00:12:24.259
against the Spanish absolutist
state,

00:12:24.259 --> 00:12:28.774
that begins in 1572 and goes on
and off all the time until Dutch

00:12:28.774 --> 00:12:33.072
independence is recognized--it
was a fait accompli for a long

00:12:33.072 --> 00:12:35.304
time,
but until the Dutch

00:12:35.304 --> 00:12:39.373
independence was recognized in
1648 at the Treaty of

00:12:39.373 --> 00:12:40.490
Westphalia.
 

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:44.389
For the Dutch when they imagine
scary things,

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:51.340
a scary thing is an army sent
by the king of Spain to extract

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.899
more taxes from the wealthiest
of all the Spanish

00:12:56.899 --> 00:13:01.332
provinces--that is,
the Netherlands--rich because

00:13:01.332 --> 00:13:03.889
of commerce and,
as we'll see in a minute,

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:08.770
to try to force people to
remain Catholics at a time when

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:13.739
the vast majority of the Dutch
population had converted to

00:13:13.739 --> 00:13:14.960
Calvinism.
 

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.028
Those people who believed in
the Dutch Republic,

00:13:18.028 --> 00:13:20.778
which was the vast majority of
the people,

00:13:20.778 --> 00:13:24.293
just as the majority of the
population of England held to

00:13:24.293 --> 00:13:28.121
the rights of parliament,
they have this scary scenario

00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:31.764
of their rights being violated,
trampled upon,

00:13:31.764 --> 00:13:36.243
destroyed, eliminated,
eradicated by big-time absolute

00:13:36.243 --> 00:13:36.830
rulers.
 

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:41.577
The other scary thing for the
Dutch is, of course,

00:13:41.577 --> 00:13:44.000
the big guy down south.
 

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.610
Louis XIV would love to control
all of the Netherlands.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.057
His invasions at one time are
turned back when they literally

00:13:52.057 --> 00:13:54.928
open the dykes and flood the
French armies back.

00:13:54.928 --> 00:13:59.886
In the mental construction of
the Dutch and the English both

00:13:59.886 --> 00:14:03.500
involves one thing they don't
want to be.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.302
That is to lose their
prerogatives,

00:14:05.302 --> 00:14:07.210
their rights to an absolute
state.

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.923
In both cases,
this becomes part of their

00:14:10.923 --> 00:14:12.408
self-identity.
 

00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:14.528
That's an essential part,
as my good friend,

00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:16.451
Linda Colley,
who used to teach here and

00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:17.929
sadly is not here anymore.
 

00:14:17.929 --> 00:14:19.230
She's at Princeton.
 

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:23.624
She made an argument in her
very successful book called

00:14:23.624 --> 00:14:27.042
Britons,
the construction of British

00:14:27.042 --> 00:14:28.100
identity.
 

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.379
I will argue later in the
course,

00:14:30.379 --> 00:14:35.432
in 1848 it has to get
reinvented again by imagining an

00:14:35.432 --> 00:14:38.254
other,
who is perceived as sneaky and

00:14:38.254 --> 00:14:40.075
dangerous,
and of course in that case it's

00:14:40.075 --> 00:14:42.625
the French,
but also the point of view of

00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:46.297
the British, the Irish,
who are conceived of as being

00:14:46.297 --> 00:14:50.056
capable because of their quest
for--"I don't want to be

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:53.590
trampled by the English,
especially by English

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.590
Protestants"-- of hooking
up with France,

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:04.110
which they tried to do in 1798,
or in World War I with Germany,

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.070
because there were some
attempts by the Germans to stoke

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:08.899
up Irish independence movements.
 

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:12.072
Again, the only point here is
that they see themselves as

00:15:12.072 --> 00:15:13.149
anti-absolutists.
 

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:16.517
This helps them create this
sense of identity,

00:15:16.517 --> 00:15:20.110
which helps determine their
political origins.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.133
You'll find nothing comparable
in Russia, obviously which I'll

00:15:23.133 --> 00:15:25.067
come back and talk about,
or in Prussia,

00:15:25.067 --> 00:15:25.908
or in France.
 

00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:28.495
You can talk about the origins
of French nationalism in the

00:15:28.495 --> 00:15:30.100
middle of the eighteenth
century,

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.870
but it's very closely tied to
this dynasty,

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:38.690
at least until they lop off the
guy's head in 1793.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:42.570
So, that's that point.
 

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.879
Third is decentralization.
 

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:51.899
Both of these states are
decentralized states.

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:56.690
The British don't have a police
force until 1827 or 1829,

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.453
I can't remember which,
when Robert Peale creates a

00:15:59.453 --> 00:16:01.759
London police force which they
call the Bobbies,

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:03.544
after, like,
Robert, Bob,

00:16:03.544 --> 00:16:04.289
Bobbies.
 

00:16:04.289 --> 00:16:05.360
People didn't want that.
 

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.950
They didn't want a large
standing army.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.460
What have they identified large
standing armies with?

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.919
They always had to have a large
standing navy for obvious

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:12.360
reasons.
 

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:17.892
But they identified large
standing armies with France or

00:16:17.892 --> 00:16:24.129
with the Spain of Phillip II or
with Prussia or with Russia.

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:27.293
So, it didn't mean that the
English state wasn't efficient

00:16:27.293 --> 00:16:29.500
in collecting taxes,
because they were more

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.700
efficient than the French were
in collecting taxes.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.649
But it does mean that this
decentralization is an essential

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:38.168
part of who they thought they
were.

00:16:38.168 --> 00:16:43.283
The local sheriff will call out
the guys and restore order when

00:16:43.283 --> 00:16:44.769
there's trouble.
 

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:50.143
There is this real fear that
large standing armies could

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:55.808
ultimately compromise the rights
of freeborn Englishmen.

00:16:55.808 --> 00:16:58.340
That's in a way that they would
have put it.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:01.745
In the case of the Netherlands,
which I'll come back to in a

00:17:01.745 --> 00:17:04.123
while,
you have these provinces

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:07.365
that--although Holland,
which is the province of

00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:10.480
Amsterdam,
is by far the most important

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.548
and most prosperous of the Dutch
provinces,

00:17:14.548 --> 00:17:18.009
such as that we often miscall
the Netherlands Holland,

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:21.038
in fact Holland is just one of
the provinces,

00:17:21.038 --> 00:17:24.259
as if you called the United
States New York or California,

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:29.006
because those are the two most
powerful states in the United

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:29.730
States.
 

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.257
But this decentralized
federalist structure is part of

00:17:33.257 --> 00:17:37.317
who they thought they were and
who they continue to think they

00:17:37.317 --> 00:17:37.848
are.
 

00:17:37.848 --> 00:17:43.968
This is very different than
these absolute kings who can

00:17:43.968 --> 00:17:48.189
send out their armies,
can run by their minions to

00:17:48.189 --> 00:17:51.598
squish whomever they want like
grapes whenever there's trouble.

00:17:51.598 --> 00:17:55.364
We can exaggerate the power of
Peter the Great in this vast

00:17:55.364 --> 00:17:59.063
empire that's expanding south
and already expanding toward

00:17:59.063 --> 00:18:01.400
Siberia and such distant places.
 

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.028
It took a long time to get the
guys there.

00:18:04.028 --> 00:18:06.608
But when they got there,
there was hell to pay.

00:18:06.608 --> 00:18:10.784
Very, very different than this
federalist decentralized

00:18:10.784 --> 00:18:13.798
structure of both of these
countries.

00:18:13.798 --> 00:18:15.390
The political outcome is
different.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:16.440
You can also make that
argument,

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.009
this isn't the course to do
that,

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:22.022
but you can make that argument
about the United States and the

00:18:22.022 --> 00:18:26.232
evolution of the United States,
because of the prestige of

00:18:26.232 --> 00:18:29.875
local leaders and the
decentralized nature of the

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:34.503
colonies already at the time of
the War of Independence--which

00:18:34.503 --> 00:18:39.210
is going to have a strong role
in the political outcome,

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.231
for better or for worse--in
this country where you have this

00:18:42.231 --> 00:18:45.202
sort of wacko political system
that still exists because of

00:18:45.202 --> 00:18:47.390
people screaming,
"state's rights,"

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.940
and all that.
 

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.308
But that's another subject.
 

00:18:51.308 --> 00:18:56.190
Fourth, anti-Catholicism in
both cases.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:57.710
Why?
 

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.829
Because these are major
countries in the Reformation.

00:19:02.829 --> 00:19:07.060
The English Reformation,
which begins with Henry VIII

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:12.490
wanting to divorce and kill his
various wives along the way,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.588
still had an awful lot to do
with the resistance to the power

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:19.935
of Rome and the power of the
Catholic Church as an

00:19:19.935 --> 00:19:21.028
institution.
 

00:19:21.028 --> 00:19:25.910
In the case of the Netherlands,
anti-Catholicism is endemic.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:26.670
Why?
 

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.404
Because it's identified with
the Spanish empire,

00:19:29.404 --> 00:19:31.445
with Spain,
which not only wanted to

00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:34.255
extract taxes and other revenue
from its most prosperous

00:19:34.255 --> 00:19:37.125
province,
but wanted to force people to

00:19:37.125 --> 00:19:38.420
remain Catholic.
 

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.631
When they send this guy called
the Duke of Alba up to the

00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:47.218
Netherlands, he burns people to
the stake and all this kind of

00:19:47.218 --> 00:19:47.970
stuff.
 

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:53.058
The association of Catholicism
as the dominant religion in both

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:56.343
of the enemy countries,
France and Spain,

00:19:56.343 --> 00:19:58.558
is extremely important.
 

00:19:58.558 --> 00:20:01.459
This is not to say that the
Dutch don't fight the English,

00:20:01.459 --> 00:20:02.630
too, because they do.
 

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.078
There are various wars over
control of the seas.

00:20:06.078 --> 00:20:09.140
But nonetheless,
in the imagination,

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:15.338
in the imaginaire,
in the mental construction of

00:20:15.338 --> 00:20:18.507
these two countries,
what we are not,

00:20:18.507 --> 00:20:22.838
that is Catholic,
helps define their identity.

00:20:22.838 --> 00:20:24.836
Of course, the particular
problem of Ireland,

00:20:24.836 --> 00:20:26.970
the challenge of Ireland as I
suggested earlier,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.650
has an awful lot to do with
that.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:31.051
And the reinvention in the
nineteenth century of British

00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:33.759
identity will also have a lot to
do with fear of the Irish,

00:20:33.759 --> 00:20:35.630
"the enemy within,"
as they were perceived.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.480
But more about that.
 

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:40.731
I'll talk about that a lot and
try to explain there was no

00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:43.118
revolution in England in 1848.
 

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:48.048
In the course of Britain,
it's even clearer.

00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:52.970
The French are "the sneaky
French."

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.361
From the French point of view,
it's the perfidious Albion

00:20:56.361 --> 00:20:57.328
already there.
 

00:20:57.328 --> 00:21:02.333
You can go all the way up to
the origins of World War I to

00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:02.858
see.
 

00:21:02.858 --> 00:21:05.240
When the British get into World
War I,

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.643
it's because of the violation
of Belgian neutrality by the

00:21:08.643 --> 00:21:10.261
Germans,
because the idea of having

00:21:10.261 --> 00:21:12.298
another enemyâ€¦we've
already got the French across

00:21:12.298 --> 00:21:14.039
the channel and it's not that
big a channel.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:15.500
You can swim across it.
 

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.589
I couldn't and you couldn't
either but lots of people have.

00:21:18.589 --> 00:21:19.828
They do it all the time.
 

00:21:19.828 --> 00:21:22.308
But if you've got the Germans
in Ostende eating moules

00:21:22.308 --> 00:21:25.025
frites,
eating mussels with French

00:21:25.025 --> 00:21:26.633
fries,
and you've already got the

00:21:26.633 --> 00:21:28.789
French there,
this is unthinkable.

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:31.538
So, they go to war.
 

00:21:31.538 --> 00:21:35.942
I don't want to exaggerate this
too much, but the largest riots

00:21:35.942 --> 00:21:39.990
in Britain in the eighteenth
century are not the riots for

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.980
political reform at all.
 

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.076
They are the anti-Catholic
riots called the Gordon Riots,

00:21:45.076 --> 00:21:46.680
which take place in London.
 

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:54.861
Anti-Catholicism is very much
strongly entrenched in the

00:21:54.861 --> 00:21:59.769
British sense of who they were.
 

00:21:59.769 --> 00:22:03.048
Anti-French--there we go.
 

00:22:03.048 --> 00:22:08.798
Those two are already linked,
along with anti-absolutism and

00:22:08.798 --> 00:22:10.650
anti-Catholicism.
 

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.140
Last, and all these things are
linked.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.311
You could do one of these
little boxes they do in

00:22:16.311 --> 00:22:19.028
sociology or political science,
and have these arrows running

00:22:19.028 --> 00:22:20.069
all over the place.
 

00:22:20.069 --> 00:22:22.190
You could make it there.
 

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:29.818
Who are the biggest trading
powers in Europe?

00:22:29.818 --> 00:22:34.598
We forget about the enormous
trading vitality of Asia,

00:22:34.598 --> 00:22:38.720
even sea vitality and land
vitality at the same time,

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.457
but they are without any
question by this point--with the

00:22:41.457 --> 00:22:45.269
decline of the Spanish empire,
which begins before this

00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:48.480
course--the Dutch and the
English.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.111
What this does is it increases
the role of this commercial

00:22:53.111 --> 00:22:54.328
middle class.
 

00:22:54.328 --> 00:22:57.953
It increases the role of
cities, particularly port

00:22:57.953 --> 00:23:00.098
cities, which Amsterdam is.
 

00:23:00.098 --> 00:23:05.323
And it increases the role of
these economic elites or their

00:23:05.323 --> 00:23:10.635
concern with maintaining their
privileges against threats to

00:23:10.635 --> 00:23:16.038
their privileges and to their
prosperity no matter where they

00:23:16.038 --> 00:23:17.480
come from.
 

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.119
Just to amuse yourself,
not for any kind of punitive

00:23:20.119 --> 00:23:23.135
think-about-the-exam exercise,
but it would be fun to take

00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:25.808
these categories and think about
these other countries,

00:23:25.808 --> 00:23:27.558
particularly those who were
absolute states,

00:23:27.558 --> 00:23:32.675
other large important states in
Europe and see to what extent

00:23:32.675 --> 00:23:35.318
you have these factors there.
 

00:23:35.318 --> 00:23:38.930
Prussia, I already said,
you've got your big nobles.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:42.045
You've got all these guys with
dueling scars,

00:23:42.045 --> 00:23:45.868
and for them to be indulging in
commerce is just crass,

00:23:45.868 --> 00:23:49.410
and not terribly manly,
and all this business.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:53.006
You've got your flute-playing
king, Frederick the Great,

00:23:53.006 --> 00:23:54.380
who could be awful.
 

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.920
He could lash out.
 

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.395
Voltaire went and hung out with
Frederick the Great,

00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:01.309
and after a while he said,
"Let me out of here."

00:24:01.309 --> 00:24:04.286
But you've got Berlin,
which was a very important

00:24:04.286 --> 00:24:06.307
town,
but it's a very important city

00:24:06.307 --> 00:24:09.493
because it's got this huge
garrison and it's got factories

00:24:09.493 --> 00:24:11.338
turning out military uniforms.
 

00:24:11.338 --> 00:24:15.759
It's got Potsdam Palace and all
of this.

00:24:15.759 --> 00:24:19.630
It's not at all the same thing
as Amsterdam,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:24.578
or London, or any of the other
trading cities around.

00:24:24.578 --> 00:24:27.190
In the case of Russia,
it's even easier.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.500
You've got a practically
nonexistent middle class.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.269
You've got all sorts of nobles.
 

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:33.854
They are involved in commerce,
some of them,

00:24:33.854 --> 00:24:36.859
but mostly what they do is they
serve the state.

00:24:36.859 --> 00:24:38.930
They're called service nobility.
 

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.589
They're not serving the cities.
 

00:24:40.589 --> 00:24:41.769
They're not serving commerce.
 

00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:43.654
What they're doing is they're
doing is they're serving the

00:24:43.654 --> 00:24:43.920
state.
 

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.095
They're serving this huge,
lumbering, strange guy,

00:24:48.095 --> 00:24:49.630
Peter the Great.
 

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.539
Then you could take other
places, like Italy and smaller

00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:54.180
cities.
 

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.640
But you don't yet have these
big state structures.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.366
So, if you're looking back,
say, from the end of the

00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:01.509
nineteenth century,
it's not easy to see,

00:25:01.509 --> 00:25:05.352
but you can see these--don't
ever think that history runs on

00:25:05.352 --> 00:25:07.720
railroad tracks,
and all you need is the

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.028
timetable to show when
modernization shows up.

00:25:10.028 --> 00:25:13.298
That's a most ludicrous word,
really,

00:25:13.298 --> 00:25:17.670
in contemporary social science
or orthodox Marxist,

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:20.019
where you just had to say,
"Well, eventually the

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:21.799
proletariat will rise up,
because the bourgeoisie did

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:22.519
this before."
 

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:25.490
But yet when you look back from
the nineteenth century,

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.462
these factors do count in
explaining how countries turn

00:25:28.462 --> 00:25:30.170
out to be the way they are.
 

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.308
When you try and look at the
origins of World War I,

00:25:32.308 --> 00:25:38.041
it mattered that Germany is run
by this kind of madcap dufus,

00:25:38.041 --> 00:25:41.858
Wilhelm II,
who was intellectually lazy and

00:25:41.858 --> 00:25:45.779
liked to break bottles of
Riesling over bright,

00:25:45.779 --> 00:25:49.240
shiny battleships and didn't
concentrate on things very long,

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:52.488
and sends off provocative
telegrams here and there to make

00:25:52.488 --> 00:25:53.400
everybody mad.
 

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.325
That has a long-run outcome,
which cost the lives of

00:25:56.325 --> 00:25:57.529
millions of people.
 

00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:59.730
Anyway, here we go.
 

00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:01.940
It's just kind of fun to think
about that, so that's what we

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.390
are doing.
 

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:03.640
We're thinking about that.
 

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.089
Now, let's dim the lights.
 

00:26:07.089 --> 00:26:10.420
Here we go.
 

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.660
How do we dim the lights?
 

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:17.599
I can't remember.
 

00:26:17.599 --> 00:26:20.328
Is that good?
 

00:26:20.328 --> 00:26:26.140
We've got to get further down
than that.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:38.065
So, the lectureâ€¦
Okay, now paralleling what

00:26:38.065 --> 00:26:45.375
you've been reading,
let's look a little bit at the

00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:48.329
Dutch Republic,
because people talk about

00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:49.548
England and Britain all the
time,

00:26:49.548 --> 00:26:53.279
so let me talk about the Dutch
Republic.

00:26:53.279 --> 00:26:57.114
This will kind of bring some of
these factors together,

00:26:57.114 --> 00:27:01.019
along with the idea of what
people thought they were.

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:02.880
What is their identity?
 

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.730
Here again, we'll look at some
paintings.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:06.470
You're not responsible for
these paintings,

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:10.250
but we'll illustrate ways in
which the Dutch Republic,

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.838
and their social structure,
and what they emphasized,

00:27:12.838 --> 00:27:16.410
and who they thought they were
was very different than,

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.710
for example,
la belle France.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:26.568
So, here we have Amsterdam.
 

00:27:26.568 --> 00:27:32.327
It grows dramatically because
of this global trade in the

00:27:32.327 --> 00:27:34.589
seventeenth century.
 

00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:36.589
That was 1613.
 

00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:37.519
I made this.
 

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:38.750
It's all a bunch of jumble.
 

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:45.130
But this is 1640,
or something like that--later.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.650
But what you have are these
canals.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.692
Many of you,
or some of you have had the

00:27:48.692 --> 00:27:51.940
good fortune to go to one of
Europe's most wonderful cities.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:55.490
The canals were used to
transport goods.

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:58.924
Thus, the city structure
itself, the way the city was

00:27:58.924 --> 00:28:02.558
built with houses along the
canals reflects the economic

00:28:02.558 --> 00:28:04.410
primacy of global trade.
 

00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:06.589
At this time the Dutch are
sending herrings,

00:28:06.589 --> 00:28:09.949
these long flat boats,
herring ships are going all the

00:28:09.949 --> 00:28:12.539
way to Newfoundland in the
seventeenth century,

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:14.737
and Iceland,
freezing off the coast of

00:28:14.737 --> 00:28:15.190
Iceland.
 

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.472
They control and dominate the
Baltic trade,

00:28:17.472 --> 00:28:19.647
and herring is an important
part of that,

00:28:19.647 --> 00:28:22.910
because herring will keep once
it's salted and all that.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.942
The city of Amsterdam grows up
not only as part of this

00:28:27.942 --> 00:28:32.509
victorious struggle against the
Spanish armies.

00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:36.960
There's a wonderful book by my
former colleague,

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.200
Geoffrey Parker,
called The Spanish Road,

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.739
which talked about how
difficult it was for the Spanish

00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:45.819
to get troops all the way to the
Netherlands.

00:28:45.819 --> 00:28:48.298
They had to go from Italy,
because much of Italy was

00:28:48.298 --> 00:28:51.442
controlled by Spain,
through the Alps all the way up

00:28:51.442 --> 00:28:55.619
along the Rhine and finally get
into the Dutch Republic.

00:28:55.619 --> 00:28:57.630
It was a losing battle.
 

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:02.685
But Amsterdam reflects this
kind of primacy of the global

00:29:02.685 --> 00:29:05.121
economy,
because it's such an important

00:29:05.121 --> 00:29:08.354
trading power,
but also this federalist

00:29:08.354 --> 00:29:13.490
decentralized aspect that I've
tried to describe.

00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:16.230
This is the shipyard behind.
 

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.328
In fact, this building behind
is still there.

00:29:18.328 --> 00:29:21.063
I go to Amsterdam--not
frequently, but I've been there

00:29:21.063 --> 00:29:22.920
ten or twelve times,
or something.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.078
I did a Yale trip there.
 

00:29:25.078 --> 00:29:27.375
I remember we took all these
alumni around to look at all

00:29:27.375 --> 00:29:27.910
this stuff.
 

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.880
That was mildly fun.
 

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.970
What the Dutch did--the
Netherlands is an

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:39.144
extraordinarily small country,
and it's the most populated

00:29:39.144 --> 00:29:40.710
country in Europe,
then,

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:45.009
per square kilometer,
and is now--once.

00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:49.612
What they have to do in order
to feed the population,

00:29:49.612 --> 00:29:52.180
you have to have more land.
 

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.358
How are you going to get more
land?

00:29:54.358 --> 00:29:55.721
One of the incredible things if
you're driving,

00:29:55.721 --> 00:29:57.150
say,
from Groningen,

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:58.829
and you're going to go all the
way down to Amsterdam,

00:29:58.829 --> 00:30:02.054
when you drive along the coast,
you're driving along this sort

00:30:02.054 --> 00:30:03.930
of road that's out in the sea.
 

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:08.425
All the land between the water
on the left side and a long,

00:30:08.425 --> 00:30:11.759
long way has been reclaimed
from the sea.

00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:13.400
This is the seventeenth century.
 

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.236
This isn't scuba diving now off
the Great Barrier Reef,

00:30:16.236 --> 00:30:17.548
or something like that.
 

00:30:17.548 --> 00:30:21.576
What they're doing is they're
reclaiming the land from the

00:30:21.576 --> 00:30:22.000
sea.
 

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.183
What this has to do with global
economy is that you have to be

00:30:25.183 --> 00:30:26.750
able to feed the population.
 

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:30.566
They have, along with the
English--and these two facts are

00:30:30.566 --> 00:30:33.108
related--an agricultural
revolution.

00:30:33.108 --> 00:30:36.582
They have an agricultural
revolution, investment in

00:30:36.582 --> 00:30:40.539
commercialized agriculture,
and increase in the production

00:30:40.539 --> 00:30:41.858
in rural areas.
 

00:30:41.858 --> 00:30:45.328
In the case of the Netherlands,
it's because of this.

00:30:45.328 --> 00:30:47.858
I'll talk about why it happened
in Britain another time.

00:30:47.858 --> 00:30:49.170
It's because they reclaimed
land.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.690
How much land do they reclaim
from the sea?

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:57.940
Well, 36,000 acres just between
1590 and 1615.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.851
That's a phenomenal amount,
and they keep going over and

00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:01.538
over again.
 

00:31:01.538 --> 00:31:05.693
The population of the Dutch
Republic increases between 1550

00:31:05.693 --> 00:31:08.558
and 1650 to almost two million
people.

00:31:08.558 --> 00:31:12.281
This is in a pretty small--it's
bigger than Belgium,

00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:15.130
but this is a pretty small
territory.

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:22.041
Amsterdam, by mid-seventeenth
century, by 1650,

00:31:22.041 --> 00:31:26.548
increases to 150,000 people.
 

00:31:26.548 --> 00:31:31.881
They build these three large
canals and this expands the area

00:31:31.881 --> 00:31:34.368
of the city by four times.
 

00:31:34.368 --> 00:31:41.317
What this means is that boats
can dock outside these kind of

00:31:41.317 --> 00:31:47.792
big warehouses and can unload
or, depending on the case,

00:31:47.792 --> 00:31:49.558
load goods.
 

00:31:49.558 --> 00:31:55.125
You have 500 miles of canals
dug just in the middle decades

00:31:55.125 --> 00:31:57.910
of the seventeenth century.
 

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:01.128
It becomes this economic dynamo
because of that,

00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:04.278
and thus traders are to be
found everywhere.

00:32:04.278 --> 00:32:10.068
In the 1630s there are 2,500
trading ships.

00:32:10.068 --> 00:32:14.038
They become the principal
supplier of grain and fish in

00:32:14.038 --> 00:32:14.700
Europe.
 

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.848
The Dutch dominate the Baltic
trade.

00:32:19.848 --> 00:32:23.351
Cities like Gdansk,
which we tend to forget about,

00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:26.496
unfortunately,
which is a very important port

00:32:26.496 --> 00:32:28.140
then and still now.
 

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.622
It's where Solidarity began,
too, as many of you know,

00:32:31.622 --> 00:32:32.278
in 1980.
 

00:32:32.278 --> 00:32:37.720
It's an important port in all
of this.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.430
They reach the East Indies in
the 1620s and the 1630s.

00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:47.538
They bring back cinnamon,
nutmeg, and all sorts of

00:32:47.538 --> 00:32:48.788
valuables.
 

00:32:48.788 --> 00:32:53.440
It's this kind of wealth that
allow them to fight this long,

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.460
hard war of independence,
which they finally win.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.130
Now, why is this in here?
 

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.098
This is Rembrandt,
as most of you know.

00:33:01.098 --> 00:33:04.480
This is called The Night
Watch.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.731
The importance of this painting
is who is being painted and,

00:33:08.731 --> 00:33:11.758
more than that,
who is getting Rembrandt to

00:33:11.758 --> 00:33:12.839
paint this.
 

00:33:12.839 --> 00:33:18.019
If you go down into France,
if you go to la belle

00:33:18.019 --> 00:33:21.192
France,
the painting is dominated by

00:33:21.192 --> 00:33:23.440
nobles who want pictures of
themselves,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:29.008
or the tiresome Sun King and
all his sort of miserable

00:33:29.008 --> 00:33:32.548
hangers-on,
very rich, miserable hangers-on.

00:33:32.548 --> 00:33:37.184
What the Dutch painters painted
reflects in the same way that

00:33:37.184 --> 00:33:41.666
Renaissance art reflected what
was important to Renaissance

00:33:41.666 --> 00:33:42.440
Italy.
 

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:45.640
Who did the commissioning of
painting?

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.851
I care because my mother was a
painter, she was a portrait

00:33:47.851 --> 00:33:48.240
painter.
 

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.750
That's how we survived in
Portland, Oregon.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.892
Who commissioned these
paintings and what they painted

00:33:54.892 --> 00:33:57.619
tell you who these people
thought they were.

00:33:57.619 --> 00:33:58.970
That's pretty interesting.
 

00:33:58.970 --> 00:33:59.950
Who are these?
 

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.088
This is The Night Watch.
 

00:34:01.088 --> 00:34:03.858
These are the guys who run
Amsterdam.

00:34:03.858 --> 00:34:09.539
This is essentially the town
hall of Amsterdam.

00:34:09.539 --> 00:34:12.664
In fact, that building itself,
of which I don't have a slide,

00:34:12.664 --> 00:34:13.809
is extremely modest.
 

00:34:13.809 --> 00:34:18.554
It looks so terribly different
than anything like the Spanish

00:34:18.554 --> 00:34:23.141
palace outside of Madrid or
anything that ever had anything

00:34:23.141 --> 00:34:26.860
to do with the Prussian kings
and all that.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:28.329
Well, that's pretty obvious.
 

00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:31.079
This is the weighing house.
 

00:34:31.079 --> 00:34:32.280
Here, this is very classic.
 

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.559
I'm not a professor of
architecture,

00:34:33.559 --> 00:34:36.300
but it's obvious this is
northern European architecture

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.280
that you can see in northern
France,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.250
cities like Arras and other
places,

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.659
or Charleville-Mezieres in the
Ardennes.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:43.760
It's one of the most fabulous
plazas anywhere.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.161
Or in the Place des Vosges,
which is by far the most

00:34:46.161 --> 00:34:48.329
beautiful plaza in Paris,
you have this kind of

00:34:48.329 --> 00:34:49.130
architecture.
 

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.769
But this is the weighing house
there.

00:34:51.769 --> 00:34:56.090
Here's another one.
 

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:57.530
The buildings are the most
important.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.164
Buildings in the cities are not
huge, over-the-top Baroque

00:35:01.164 --> 00:35:03.778
churches, such as the
Gésu in Rome,

00:35:03.778 --> 00:35:04.800
for example.
 

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.989
They are weighing houses.
 

00:35:05.989 --> 00:35:10.304
The town hall was in very
modest proportions because it's

00:35:10.304 --> 00:35:11.230
Calvinist.
 

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:14.518
Calvinists weren't exactly what
the French call rigolo,

00:35:14.518 --> 00:35:16.730
weren't exactly wild,
fun-loving types.

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:21.000
Even the churches are
completely denuded of the kinds

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.128
of Baroque,
swooning cherubs and clutter

00:35:24.128 --> 00:35:27.271
that you found in--;beautiful,
I'm not knocking the

00:35:27.271 --> 00:35:28.989
Baroque--but beautiful
churches--;or,

00:35:28.989 --> 00:35:32.010
in Vienna it's a good example
of that,

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.170
or anywhere is a good example
of that.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.750
Here's another weighing house.
 

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.666
This is in Gouda,
as in the cheese,

00:35:38.666 --> 00:35:40.019
but the town of Gouda.
 

00:35:40.019 --> 00:35:41.320
Amsterdam wasn't alone.
 

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:44.289
Now, here, these are houses
that are built along the canals.

00:35:44.289 --> 00:35:46.766
You've got these warehouses
along the canals and here's

00:35:46.766 --> 00:35:48.829
where the bankers--the Dutch had
the most,

00:35:48.829 --> 00:35:53.679
along with the English,
sophisticated banking system in

00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:54.800
the world.
 

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:58.373
Lloyds of London,
which now does things like

00:35:58.373 --> 00:36:02.400
insure quarterbacks' knees and
things--but it begins in the

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.010
eighteenth century when people
go into the docks.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:11.829
Because a lot of these ships go
blub on the way back,

00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:13.800
or are taken by pirates and
stuff like that,

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.510
they say, "We want to
insure this ship.

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.746
Will you sign up for ten
percent of the value of this

00:36:17.746 --> 00:36:18.518
insurance?"
 

00:36:18.518 --> 00:36:20.239
That's how Lloyds of London
starts.

00:36:20.239 --> 00:36:23.889
But you had the equivalent in
Amsterdam as well.

00:36:23.889 --> 00:36:26.969
You have access to capital by
those guys, these guys who are

00:36:26.969 --> 00:36:27.909
no longer there.
 

00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:32.146
The middle class guys behind
the screen who are going to

00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:34.380
invest in these long treks.
 

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.501
You send off a ship to
Newfoundland,

00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:39.289
or to Iceland,
or even to the Mediterranean.

00:36:39.289 --> 00:36:42.130
They start getting into the
Mediterranean and that scares

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.260
the hell out of their commercial
rivals.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.000
So, you also build these houses
for people to live in.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.279
Because there's not a lot of
room between the canals,

00:36:49.279 --> 00:36:51.909
that's why they're so steep
when you walk up these things.

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:53.369
It's almost like that.
 

00:36:53.369 --> 00:36:54.579
It's an incline.
 

00:36:54.579 --> 00:36:57.349
They seem to be reaching toward
the sky there,

00:36:57.349 --> 00:37:01.353
but not reaching toward the sky
as in the cupola of a Baroque

00:37:01.353 --> 00:37:04.889
church where you're supposed to
see God at the top.

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:07.768
Here, they look up and they see
money at the top,

00:37:07.768 --> 00:37:08.610
or whatever.
 

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:12.358
They were religious as well,
but it was a different kind of

00:37:12.358 --> 00:37:13.070
religion.
 

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.628
Here, this is a more modern
example with a little hash

00:37:16.628 --> 00:37:19.179
café next to it or
something.

00:37:19.179 --> 00:37:22.510
This is Rembrandt's house.
 

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:24.490
He had to live somewhere,
and that's where he lived

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.800
because he paints these people.
 

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.606
Rembrandt did have one time
where he started painting kind

00:37:28.606 --> 00:37:30.971
of Catholic themes,
but basically he's like these

00:37:30.971 --> 00:37:31.710
other guys.
 

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.570
They're painting--I'll tell you
in a minute.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.952
But they're painting
middle-class life in the

00:37:37.952 --> 00:37:39.030
Netherlands.
 

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:40.929
They don't do big battle scenes.
 

00:37:40.929 --> 00:37:44.744
You have to go to the southern
Netherlands or Belgium for that,

00:37:44.744 --> 00:37:45.789
or into France.
 

00:37:45.789 --> 00:37:50.340
That's what they do and that's
what they look like.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.710
That's pretty obvious.
 

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.369
This is an orphanage.
 

00:37:54.369 --> 00:37:57.420
They had, without question,
the most sophisticated

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.599
charitable institutions
anywhere.

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:01.539
In fact, we know what they ate.
 

00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:04.710
It was the most prosperous
country for ordinary people

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.369
anywhere.
 

00:38:05.369 --> 00:38:07.949
The diet here,
we know what they ate in their

00:38:07.949 --> 00:38:08.420
meals.
 

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:13.710
They ate much better than poor
people did almost anywhere else.

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:20.164
Indeed, some ordinary workers
bought paintings by Steen and

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:23.949
all sorts of these other people.
 

00:38:23.949 --> 00:38:26.250
Here is a workhouse.
 

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.989
This is a prison, basically.
 

00:38:28.989 --> 00:38:30.489
They were organized for that,
too.

00:38:30.489 --> 00:38:34.559
It was the place of toleration.
 

00:38:34.559 --> 00:38:35.719
There's no doubt about that.
 

00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:39.139
During the Enlightenment,
the works of the

00:38:39.139 --> 00:38:41.351
philosophes that could
not be published in France were

00:38:41.351 --> 00:38:43.860
published in Switzerland,
more about that another time,

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.219
and in the Netherlands.
 

00:38:45.219 --> 00:38:46.570
But they could lash out.
 

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:48.820
They lashed out at gays
sometimes.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.980
They lashed out at Catholics
sometimes.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:53.918
There was an edge to them,
as if the whole thing could

00:38:53.918 --> 00:38:55.360
collapse on their heads.
 

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.349
Simon Schama is not the only
person who made that point.

00:38:58.349 --> 00:39:01.695
Others have as well,
perhaps because of the big

00:39:01.695 --> 00:39:02.349
floods.
 

00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:04.887
If the dyke goes--here's the
image of the Dutch boy with his

00:39:04.887 --> 00:39:05.789
finger in the dyke.
 

00:39:05.789 --> 00:39:09.730
If the dyke goes,
you are drowned.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:12.384
There's this whole sense that
the thing is precarious and

00:39:12.384 --> 00:39:14.469
you'd better kind of mind your
Ps and Qs,

00:39:14.469 --> 00:39:18.684
or whatever the expression is,
and be a good person or this

00:39:18.684 --> 00:39:23.199
whole thing could kind of be
literally flooded away.

00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:27.030
How different that is than this
modest estate of Versailles.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:30.730
I worked in the archives in
Versailles in the small stables.

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:33.710
This is one of my least
favorite palaces.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:36.666
The way the Dutch thought about
themselves is a little different

00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:39.389
than the way the French nobility
or the Spanish nobles,

00:39:39.389 --> 00:39:41.835
at least at the higher ranks,
thought about themselves as

00:39:41.835 --> 00:39:42.079
well.
 

00:39:42.079 --> 00:39:43.500
I show these.
 

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.945
These are obvious,
but just to put them in

00:39:44.945 --> 00:39:46.639
comparison with what you'll see
in the middle.

00:39:46.639 --> 00:39:50.920
A little modest bedroom there
in Versailles.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.007
This is the war room,
it's called,

00:39:54.007 --> 00:39:56.161
the salon de guerre.
 

00:39:56.161 --> 00:39:57.650
I don't like Versailles.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:58.619
What the hell.
 

00:39:58.619 --> 00:40:00.280
This is Vaux-le-Vicomte,
which is much more interesting.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.630
I just put this in because I
like it.

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:04.909
It shows you there were
chateaus in the Netherlands,

00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:07.159
but they were mostly in the
east.

00:40:07.159 --> 00:40:09.918
They were nobles that had the
chateaux, and they didn't

00:40:09.918 --> 00:40:12.949
dominate;
they didn't rule.

00:40:12.949 --> 00:40:14.789
Vaux le Vicomte was fabulous.
 

00:40:14.789 --> 00:40:19.202
Louis XIV was invited by his
treasurer, a man called Fouquet,

00:40:19.202 --> 00:40:20.820
to go and eat there.
 

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.469
He was insanely jealous.
 

00:40:22.469 --> 00:40:26.614
They served him on gold plates
with gold silverware,

00:40:26.614 --> 00:40:31.329
and he had huge ponds stocked
with not only freshwater fish

00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:33.199
but saltwater fish.
 

00:40:33.199 --> 00:40:36.423
He was so jealous that he threw
him in the slammer,

00:40:36.423 --> 00:40:38.630
threw him in jail and
confiscated it.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.768
But the image is just that this
is very different.

00:40:41.768 --> 00:40:43.719
The paintings you found were
very different.

00:40:43.719 --> 00:41:02.409
Here's Rembrandt himself.
 

00:41:02.409 --> 00:41:03.420
That was Rembrandt.
 

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:08.780
That was quick.
 

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:11.969
Narcissism--he did something
like seventy self-portraits.

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:14.179
He was his own favorite subject.
 

00:41:14.179 --> 00:41:17.608
Anyway, my mother tried to
paint me, but I'd never hold

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:18.880
still long enough.
 

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.969
There's only sort of two
half-finished portraits of me.

00:41:21.969 --> 00:41:23.610
Anyway, what did people paint?
 

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:24.710
Ruysdael, don't write this down.
 

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:26.079
Well, you can if you want.
 

00:41:26.079 --> 00:41:28.592
Go to the great museum in
Amsterdam and see it at the

00:41:28.592 --> 00:41:29.268
Rijksmuseum.
 

00:41:29.268 --> 00:41:39.369
Ruysdael painted ordinary
people living and at work.

00:41:39.369 --> 00:41:42.340
These are windmills, obviously.
 

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.900
Here are windmills with people.
 

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.050
This is different.
 

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:50.996
Generally, you wouldn't find
these kinds of paintings in

00:41:50.996 --> 00:41:51.800
other places.
 

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.820
This is a painter called Frans
Hals, H-A-L-S.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.280
It's a family scene.
 

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.833
These are middle-class people
commissioning paintings of

00:42:00.833 --> 00:42:01.909
themselves.
 

00:42:01.909 --> 00:42:05.239
It's the equivalent of fancy
patricians in Florence having

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:06.760
paintings of themselves.
 

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.081
But they're from a very
different social class,

00:42:10.081 --> 00:42:12.900
the patricians of Florence or
Venice.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.489
This is to set the theme.
 

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:17.588
I love still life,
especially if they have food

00:42:17.588 --> 00:42:18.090
and wine.
 

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:20.170
There's some wine up there.
 

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:23.610
This is Pieter Claesz,
C-L-A-E-S-Z,

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.139
probably mispronounced.
 

00:42:26.139 --> 00:42:27.070
This is still life.
 

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.018
They paint food.
 

00:42:28.018 --> 00:42:29.829
They paint food,
and people eating,

00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:33.210
and people having fun,
not people at war,

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:37.391
not the eighteenth-century
inevitable paintings of the

00:42:37.391 --> 00:42:41.809
British nobles or land big
gentry looking over all of the

00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:46.465
villages they've had knocked
down so they could expand their

00:42:46.465 --> 00:42:50.110
hunting terrain,
or fondling the nose of their

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.429
killer hunting dogs,
or something like that.

00:42:52.429 --> 00:42:54.969
It's just a very different way
of imagining oneself.

00:42:54.969 --> 00:42:55.969
It's very attractive.
 

00:42:55.969 --> 00:42:57.909
I must admit it's very
attractive.

00:42:57.909 --> 00:42:59.300
This is the village school.
 

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.175
They had the highest literacy
rate in the world,

00:43:02.175 --> 00:43:04.500
point,
period, the Dutch did.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:05.789
They were very,
very ordinary people.

00:43:05.789 --> 00:43:07.250
There were poor people in the
Netherlands.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.181
Nonetheless,
they were very ordinary

00:43:10.181 --> 00:43:12.110
literate poor people.
 

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.469
There's something to be said
for that.

00:43:13.469 --> 00:43:14.840
I like cats a lot.
 

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.489
I hate dogs,
but anyway, this is children

00:43:17.489 --> 00:43:18.880
playing with a cat.
 

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:25.139
My cat yesterday actually undid
my Yale password last night.

00:43:25.139 --> 00:43:27.030
I saw the thing that said
password.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:29.152
The next I knew,
she had literally typed my

00:43:29.152 --> 00:43:29.710
password.
 

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:30.219
I had to put a new one.
 

00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:31.914
This has nothing to do with
anyone, so you should take this

00:43:31.914 --> 00:43:32.090
out.
 

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:34.840
Anyway, cats.
 

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.030
There we go--boules.
 

00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:38.251
This is what we do in the South
of France with a little

00:43:38.251 --> 00:43:39.570
chardonnay on the side.
 

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:40.039
We play boules.
 

00:43:40.039 --> 00:43:41.599
It's not quite the same thing.
 

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:42.340
That's like bocce.
 

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.050
We have this sort of metal ball.
 

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.710
That's for another lecture,
ça n'a rien à

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:50.626
voir avecâ€¦
These are ordinary people

00:43:50.626 --> 00:43:51.489
having fun.
 

00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:54.030
Here they are.
 

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:56.559
Here they're having fun.
 

00:43:56.559 --> 00:43:59.250
But they're having too much fun.
 

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.518
This is part of the point.
 

00:44:00.518 --> 00:44:03.443
Part of this sort of this
inveterate Calvinism,

00:44:03.443 --> 00:44:06.492
and part of the fact that,
"what if the dams

00:44:06.492 --> 00:44:07.510
burst?"
 

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:12.050
Or what if the British begin to
outdo us in the world trade

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:13.070
department?
 

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:18.920
Or what if the French come and
squish us like grapes?

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.239
There's always this sense of
vulnerability.

00:44:21.239 --> 00:44:24.230
Behind the paintings of people
eating,

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.840
the theme of people eating or
praying prayers at mealtime,

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.346
and this sort of thing,
or playing boules,

00:44:30.346 --> 00:44:31.929
pétanque,
bocce,

00:44:31.929 --> 00:44:34.880
there is always this sense of
the ribald family.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:38.590
That's what this is called by
Jan Steen, S-T-E-E-N.

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:42.639
If you have too much fun,
things will get away from you.

00:44:42.639 --> 00:44:45.688
These people are all drinking
and leaving these poor little

00:44:45.688 --> 00:44:47.369
children to their own devices.
 

00:44:47.369 --> 00:44:49.996
They may be knocking down one
or two themselves there,

00:44:49.996 --> 00:44:51.980
because nobody's paying any
attention.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:58.380
You could go too far and then
you end up like this.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.719
How does it all end up in the
long run?

00:45:00.719 --> 00:45:03.907
How it ends up in the long run
for the Dutch is that the Dutch

00:45:03.907 --> 00:45:05.369
cease to be a great power.
 

00:45:05.369 --> 00:45:07.030
But there's nothing wrong with
that.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:12.159
They have gone on to live
highly prosperous lives.

00:45:12.159 --> 00:45:14.889
They eventually end up with a
monarchy.

00:45:14.889 --> 00:45:18.500
They eventually lose Belgium in
1831.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:20.690
They basically didn't care.
 

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:25.768
The Dutch economy,
the equivalent would be the

00:45:25.768 --> 00:45:32.878
decline of the Venetian economic
power in the Mediterranean--and

00:45:32.878 --> 00:45:36.829
trade with the East diminishes.
 

00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:43.404
The Netherlands ceases to be a
great power, whereas Britain in

00:45:43.404 --> 00:45:48.469
1707 becomes the biggest of the
world powers.

00:45:48.469 --> 00:45:51.054
But let us still remember these
six or seven factors,

00:45:51.054 --> 00:45:53.737
or whatever I had up there,
and remember what these two

00:45:53.737 --> 00:45:54.980
places had in common.
 

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.750
It has a lot to do with the
global trade.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:58.219
It has a lot to do with social
structure.

00:45:58.219 --> 00:46:01.418
It has a lot to do with who
they thought they were,

00:46:01.418 --> 00:46:04.233
the paintings they bought,
the paintings they

00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:07.369
commissioned,
the way they viewed themselves.

00:46:07.369 --> 00:46:12.585
Part of this reconstructing of
national identity often has as

00:46:12.585 --> 00:46:16.760
much to do with who you're not,
not absolute,

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:23.340
not Catholic, not French,
as it does with you who imagine

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.099
yourself to be.
 

00:46:25.099 --> 00:46:28.697
In the growth of national
awareness, that itself is an

00:46:28.697 --> 00:46:29.920
important theme.
 

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.610
Have a great weekend.
 

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:31.800
See you on Monday.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.347
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Now,

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:17.802
this is not only a course for
English majors,

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:20.080
but for other majors too.
 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.457
The poets we'll be
reading--well,

00:00:22.457 --> 00:00:25.429
they knew about science,
music, politics,

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.974
economics,
and they presumed to talk about

00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:32.124
those things,
in their poetry and out of

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:33.740
their poetry too.
 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:40.077
My lectures are going to
presume no special knowledge on

00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:45.501
your part.
I see this as a course that's

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:51.772
an introduction to the
literature of a period,

00:00:51.772 --> 00:00:54.560
to modern poetry.
 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.500
We'll be studying several poets
in some detail.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.287
The presumption is that they
all reward and demand a certain

00:01:06.287 --> 00:01:09.719
amount of close reading.
 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.097
At the same time,
I do mean to give you some

00:01:13.097 --> 00:01:16.790
sense of the period in which
they're writing,

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.546
some sense of modernism as a
field, as one of the richest

00:01:23.546 --> 00:01:28.010
fields in English language
writing.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.021
Finally, though,
this really is a course in

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:34.599
poetry, plain and simple.
 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:39.434
I mean to introduce you to
particular poems,

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:44.380
to give you ways to possess
them, enjoy them,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.989
be puzzled or frustrated by
them too;

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:54.845
to learn something from them
and to care about them and to

00:01:54.845 --> 00:02:00.700
carry them with you as you go
forward after this class.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.816
So, that's a sense of what I
want to accomplish in these

00:02:05.816 --> 00:02:09.690
lectures.
It will mean reading a lot of

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.129
poems and writing about them
some.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.498
The syllabus you'll see notes
the general topic of each

00:02:17.498 --> 00:02:22.352
lecture and the reading that I
want you to have done for that

00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:25.039
day.
There's a Midterm.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:29.533
That will be a short answer
test that's intended to give you

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:34.179
a chance to show how diligently
you've been reading and coming

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.241
to class.
The Final will include both a

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:43.960
short answer component and then
some essay questions.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.931
There are two papers,
a shorter and a slightly longer

00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:52.667
one.
The first paper is going to ask

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.979
you to write about one short
poem;

00:02:54.979 --> 00:03:00.123
the second will ask you to
write about two or more poems,

00:03:00.123 --> 00:03:04.991
or poems perhaps by two
authors, or perhaps a poem and

00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:08.389
some other kind of text or
image.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.121
The teaching fellows in this
course, I'm lucky to work with

00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:17.410
and you are too.
They are trained and have an

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.944
interest in modern poetry,
and this is a happy

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:25.370
collaboration for me with them.
 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.653
As I say, we'll start to get
our discussion sections

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:33.181
organized on Monday and they
should be set,

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:37.129
I hope, by the Wednesday
lecture next week.

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:38.820
I want you to come to lecture
on time.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.870
I did today, I started on time.
 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.464
I don't always do that but I'd
like to, and I can if you come

00:03:46.464 --> 00:03:48.819
at 11:30.
Bring your books;

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.755
I'm going to be talking about
the texts and I hope you'll have

00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:56.103
them open.
And of course you will come to

00:03:56.103 --> 00:04:00.477
your discussion sections in the
same state of joyful

00:04:00.477 --> 00:04:05.457
preparedness.
As I say, the syllabuses should

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:09.879
be accessible on the Classsv2
server;

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.489
however, I've had problems with
that in the past and you should

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.409
please let me know if it's not.
 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.060
There are just two books for
the course;

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.660
they're both at Labyrinth.
 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.824
One is the first volume of
The Norton Anthology of

00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:28.990
Modern and Contemporary Poetry,
Third Edition.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.564
It's edited by Jahan Ramazani,
formerly a Teaching Fellow in

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:37.299
this course.
There's also Elizabeth Bishop's

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:39.350
Collected Poems.
 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:47.376
There will be a packet that you
can order from RIS that gathers

00:04:47.376 --> 00:04:51.389
a few supplementary readings.
 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:55.410
There will be the visual images
that I'm going to talk about in

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.366
lecture, and that I will make
accessible to you on the class's

00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:02.720
server.
There are also audio recordings

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.744
of the poets that we will be
reading that come from Sterling

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:13.110
and you can get to on the Center
for Language Study website.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.422
All those things we can talk
about more as the semester

00:05:19.422 --> 00:05:24.449
develops, and I hope you will
talk to me.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.050
You can do that on email,
you can do that in my office,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.737
which is downstairs on the
first floor of this building,

00:05:33.737 --> 00:05:37.966
in LC-109.
You can catch me after lecture

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:42.622
or before.
We can have lunch--all sorts of

00:05:42.622 --> 00:05:48.108
opportunities for talking,
and I hope you'll take

00:05:48.108 --> 00:05:52.334
advantage of it.
For Monday, we're going to

00:05:52.334 --> 00:05:56.760
start talking about Robert
Frost, and I'd like you to pay

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.079
special attention to his poem
"Mowing,"

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:04.387
in the RIS packet,
and to his poem "Birches" in

00:06:04.387 --> 00:06:06.259
The Norton.
 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:12.477
And as you read,
pay special attention to images

00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:15.519
of tools, work,
play.

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:21.941
Read Frost's short poetic
statement, prose poetic

00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:29.298
statement in The Norton
called "The Figure a Poem

00:06:29.298 --> 00:06:33.345
Makes."
So, The Norton

00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:37.745
Anthology,
this book, this heavy book,

00:06:37.745 --> 00:06:43.540
I order it as a way to,
well, reduce your expenses.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.440
Here's just one big book to buy.
 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.889
It also provides needed
annotation.

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:53.850
Modern poetry is in need of
annotation.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:07:00.500
This new edition of this old
book is an excellent one.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.177
You should read Jahan
Ramazani's introduction,

00:07:05.177 --> 00:07:11.310
read his prose notes that
preface his various selections.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:15.381
Having said that,
there's really nothing so dead

00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:20.274
as The Norton Anthology,
or ponderous,

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:26.066
and I do order it with a
little--well,

00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:30.449
some misgivings for that.
 

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:34.809
The poems come to you
abstracted from the contexts in

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:38.750
which they were originally
produced and read,

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:44.817
from their place in a body of
work, in a book,

00:07:44.817 --> 00:07:50.750
in a magazine,
in a life that produced it.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:57.234
In order to counteract the
packaged and monumental form of

00:07:57.234 --> 00:08:03.578
The Norton,
I will be using Beinecke's and

00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:10.089
Sterling's resources,
using Power Point digitized

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:14.424
files.
This will allow me to project

00:08:14.424 --> 00:08:20.759
images in class and for you to
look at them later at home.

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:25.446
There'll be files for not all
but most of the poets that we

00:08:25.446 --> 00:08:30.213
discuss, and the aim is to give
you some sense through those

00:08:30.213 --> 00:08:33.929
images of modern poetry in its
historical,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:39.977
material dimensions,
to represent it as something

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:46.149
that was lived,
and in many ways is living now.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:51.452
Now, the poems that you'll be
reading, we'll be talking about,

00:08:51.452 --> 00:08:55.625
did not, of course,
always exist in the form that

00:08:55.625 --> 00:09:00.358
you find them.
Their first form was very often

00:09:00.358 --> 00:09:03.804
a manuscript.
If you go to Beinecke,

00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:09.298
you can find – and we will go
to Beinecke, those of you who

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:14.518
want to come with me – and
look at manuscripts that were

00:09:14.518 --> 00:09:20.103
early versions of texts that you
now find in The Norton

00:09:20.103 --> 00:09:23.936
and other books.
When poems that had gone

00:09:23.936 --> 00:09:27.965
through their processes of
revision and so forth and came

00:09:27.965 --> 00:09:31.864
to publication,
they very often were published

00:09:31.864 --> 00:09:36.551
first, not in book form
certainly, but rather in Little

00:09:36.551 --> 00:09:41.760
Magazines that are now more or
less lost to us today but were

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.534
in fact the essential vehicle
for the creation of modern

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:50.830
poetry.
What is a Little Magazine?

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:58.659
Well, very often they were big
– big in format and size.

00:09:58.659 --> 00:10:03.889
They were little because their
circulation was small.

00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:09.048
These were the
funded-on-a-shoestring magazines

00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:15.888
that rose up and very frequently
faded away just as quickly in

00:10:15.888 --> 00:10:21.197
the 1910s and 1920s,
and that were in many cases the

00:10:21.197 --> 00:10:25.250
first avenue of publication for
Stevens, Eliot,

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:30.759
Moore, the poets that you will
be reading in this class.

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:35.620
These magazines were acutely
aware of their differences from

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.480
the popular literary magazines
of the nineteenth century,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:45.641
general interest popular
magazines of the twentieth

00:10:45.641 --> 00:10:50.080
century, magazines with wide
circulation,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.230
polite audiences.
 

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.817
The Little Magazine was written
by, addressed to,

00:10:57.817 --> 00:11:03.265
new young writers and artists,
and they were determined to

00:11:03.265 --> 00:11:07.705
make trouble.
Nothing, I think,

00:11:07.705 --> 00:11:16.649
captures the nerve of these
magazines like the cover of

00:11:16.649 --> 00:11:22.587
Blast,
which meant "kaboom," a

00:11:22.587 --> 00:11:30.163
magazine as a kind of bomb,
or maybe a curse-damn you,

00:11:30.163 --> 00:11:34.361
blast.
Pound was one of the

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:39.521
contributors.
Eliot's Rhapsody on a Windy

00:11:39.521 --> 00:11:45.557
Night appeared here in this
number of the magazine from

00:11:45.557 --> 00:11:50.760
July, 1915 in the midst of the
First World War;

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.539
 
 

00:11:57.539 --> 00:12:03.690
Rogue – another,
also from 1915.

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.580
Notice the price – five cents.
 

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:10.519
Stevens appeared here,
in this magazine.

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:14.618
You could contrast the roguish
and fanciful,

00:12:14.618 --> 00:12:18.717
clearly done by hand,
title of the magazine,

00:12:18.717 --> 00:12:22.529
with that machine-type
Blast.

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:27.983
Both of these are mischievous,
oppositional magazines but with

00:12:27.983 --> 00:12:31.380
very different styles and
attitudes.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:34.560
 
 

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:40.809
Here's another, Broom.
 

00:12:40.809 --> 00:12:43.420
This is a magazine just
slightly later.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.009
This is an issue of 1922.
 

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:50.910
It's a cover by Ferdinand
Léger;

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.590
Hart Crane would appear here.
 

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:59.201
Broom meant to make a
clean sweep of things,

00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:03.690
a clean sweep of what had come
before.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:07.790
It also clearly meant to have
fun doing it.

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:10.730
Oops, I have gone too far.
 

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.309
This is the back of the
magazine.

00:13:13.309 --> 00:13:16.956
I don't know how well you can
make it out but there's a little

00:13:16.956 --> 00:13:21.541
broom guy there with glasses,
playing air guitar with his

00:13:21.541 --> 00:13:27.611
broom, and I guess this is meant
to capture the spirit of the

00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:33.577
contributors.
Contrast that with the magazine

00:13:33.577 --> 00:13:41.289
that flashed there a moment ago,
The Criterion.

00:13:41.289 --> 00:13:43.610
This is a long way from
Broom.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:48.279
This is October 1922,
comes out just before

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:51.169
Broom is created.
 

00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:54.357
Here you've got a magazine that
doesn't present itself as

00:13:54.357 --> 00:13:57.090
attacking anything at all,
but rather as what?

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.480
As setting the standard,
The Criterion.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.690
It looks official, doesn't it?
 

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.059
The editor is T.S. Eliot.
 

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:11.980
This is the first number of the
magazine.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.313
The magazine,
in many ways,

00:14:14.313 --> 00:14:18.800
announced and facilitated
Eliot's rise to a kind of

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.389
cultural authority as a taste
maker,

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:26.139
and with it certain ideas of
modernism.

00:14:26.139 --> 00:14:28.727
This issue here,
October 1922,

00:14:28.727 --> 00:14:32.027
includes The Waste Land
by T.S.

00:14:32.027 --> 00:14:35.692
Eliot.
It also includes a little bit

00:14:35.692 --> 00:14:41.619
further down the page of review
and essay by Valerie Larbeau on

00:14:41.619 --> 00:14:46.590
a new novel by James Joyce
called Ulysses.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.680
That's some sense of the
spectrum of magazines that are

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.846
coming out, and all with
different roles to play in this

00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:59.391
culture and that position their
writers and poets and artists

00:14:59.391 --> 00:15:02.799
associated with them in
different ways.

00:15:02.799 --> 00:15:07.898
Book publication can be just as
interesting and it can tell us

00:15:07.898 --> 00:15:11.909
just as much about modern poetry
as magazines.

00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:18.734
This is The Wind Among the
Reeds, author William Butler

00:15:18.734 --> 00:15:23.657
Yeats, the year 1899,
on the verge of the new

00:15:23.657 --> 00:15:25.970
century.
It's a beautiful book.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.588
It's a book that wants to be
beautiful, that's happy to be

00:15:29.588 --> 00:15:33.610
beautiful.
It's rich in color and texture.

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:36.730
It's designed, embossed, gilt.
 

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:41.669
It's self-consciously Irish,
Celtic.

00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:47.640
There's a sense that you're
supposed to leave the bookstore

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:53.610
with a kind of talisman that you
have bought, with a Celtic

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.805
charm.
Contrast this book,

00:15:56.805 --> 00:16:01.136
Prufrock and Other
Observations,

00:16:01.136 --> 00:16:06.379
the subtitle left off here of
the cover of T.S.

00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:11.279
Eliot's great book,
published in 1917.

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:14.460
This is a different object,
isn't it?

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:19.360
Severe, unsentimental,
dry, so much so as to be maybe

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.809
even a little bit funny.
 

00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:24.866
And you laughed,
right, and I think you're

00:16:24.866 --> 00:16:28.588
supposed to.
It's not entirely serious,

00:16:28.588 --> 00:16:32.399
even as it declares its
seriousness.

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:38.117
If Yeats's book was so
explicitly Irish,

00:16:38.117 --> 00:16:41.049
look at this book.
 

00:16:41.049 --> 00:16:44.647
It has no observable
nationality at all,

00:16:44.647 --> 00:16:47.274
does it?
A certain kind of,

00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:50.590
well, you might say
impersonality.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:57.228
Its rhetoric is so flat and
unemotional, so overtly

00:16:57.228 --> 00:17:00.148
unrhetorical.
It is, in fact,

00:17:00.148 --> 00:17:03.243
a very deliberate and
self-conscious repudiation of

00:17:03.243 --> 00:17:06.710
that late romantic aesthetic
that Yeats's early book,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.380
and even the cover of that
early book, represents.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.080
Prufrock isn't beautiful
and its author is not a bard.

00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.630
 
 

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.421
Another book,
another book cover,

00:17:21.421 --> 00:17:25.084
The Weary Blues, by
Langston Hughes,

00:17:25.084 --> 00:17:27.916
1926.
Unlike Prufrock,

00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:33.077
this one is full of color and
of course it is the work of a

00:17:33.077 --> 00:17:37.136
poet of color.
The image presents the book not

00:17:37.136 --> 00:17:41.900
as a work of poetry at all but
rather as a kind of music,

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:46.250
as a book of Blues,
and it associates its poet

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.019
singer with honky-tonk piano
players;

00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:56.497
not Broom's bohemian
egghead air guitarist,

00:17:56.497 --> 00:18:04.693
but another kind of vernacular,
another kind of celebration and

00:18:04.693 --> 00:18:08.130
another kind of music.
 

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:13.192
It makes us think about black
artists playing for a living in

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:15.640
Prohibition Era back rooms.
 

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:24.676
Now, poems, like books,
project an image of the poet

00:18:24.676 --> 00:18:28.220
who produces them.
 

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:32.753
While the poet is creating her
or his poems,

00:18:32.753 --> 00:18:38.658
the poet is also creating a
poet, a certain figure of the

00:18:38.658 --> 00:18:42.559
poet, a public image of the
poet.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:47.099
And this is an evolving
project, a work in progress.

00:18:47.099 --> 00:18:50.135
That's part of the work and
part of the subject and part of

00:18:50.135 --> 00:18:52.019
what I will be talking about
here.

00:18:52.019 --> 00:18:58.223
Let's look, for example,
at a series of photos of Ezra

00:18:58.223 --> 00:19:01.965
Pound.
Together, they tell a kind of

00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:06.704
encapsulated history of this
central, fascinating,

00:19:06.704 --> 00:19:09.510
problematic poet's career.
 

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.529
He begins as an aesthete.
 

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:17.696
This is 1913,
Pound in London,

00:19:17.696 --> 00:19:21.737
styling himself,
isn't he, after those

00:19:21.737 --> 00:19:28.290
Renaissance artists and poets
whom he would write about,

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.900
translate in this period.
 

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:37.581
It could be a miniature worn by
a Provencal damsel,

00:19:37.581 --> 00:19:41.778
no?
Well, here he is a little

00:19:41.778 --> 00:19:49.824
later, Pound after the war in
1923, sort of full flower of

00:19:49.824 --> 00:19:55.276
modernism,
still a young man but he's got

00:19:55.276 --> 00:20:02.147
that cane, and he's in Paris
where he would meet Eliot and

00:20:02.147 --> 00:20:07.210
work on The Waste Land
with him.

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.450
Well, fast forward twenty years.
 

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:16.380
This is Pound,
Pound accused of treason;

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:21.359
Pound accused of treason by his
country, accused of treason as

00:20:21.359 --> 00:20:25.359
he tries to bend the world to
his vision of it,

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:30.988
and he escapes trial only by
reason of insanity when he is

00:20:30.988 --> 00:20:36.912
brought from Italy under charges
of having made broadcasts on

00:20:36.912 --> 00:20:41.844
fascist radio,
back to the United States,

00:20:41.844 --> 00:20:46.089
after an ordeal in a cage in
Pisa.

00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:55.471
And he poses for this photo as
an intake photo as he enters St.

00:20:55.471 --> 00:21:03.339
Elizabeth's Hospital for the
Insane in Washington.

00:21:03.339 --> 00:21:08.486
In this final photo from 1971,
back in Italy in Rapallo,

00:21:08.486 --> 00:21:13.914
well, here's Pound presenting
us with an image of something

00:21:13.914 --> 00:21:18.779
that would have seemed
impossible when he began,

00:21:18.779 --> 00:21:26.413
which is an image of modernism
grown old, old and blasted,

00:21:26.413 --> 00:21:31.334
in many senses.
Contrast this career,

00:21:31.334 --> 00:21:37.000
encapsulated in those images,
with this one.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.516
Who's this?
This is the author of

00:21:39.516 --> 00:21:41.807
Prufrock.
In fact, this is the Harvard

00:21:41.807 --> 00:21:43.430
student who wrote
Prufrock;

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:48.233
Eliot wrote Prufrock
largely when still at Harvard

00:21:48.233 --> 00:21:51.750
and in the years immediately
following.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:59.869
Sexy? A little, maybe;
those full, slightly parted

00:21:59.869 --> 00:22:04.624
lips, that windswept hair,
the general J.

00:22:04.624 --> 00:22:12.890
Crew look.
Notice the handkerchief.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:17.979
Here's the editor,
great editor of the publisher

00:22:17.979 --> 00:22:21.985
Faber &amp; Faber,
thirty years later,

00:22:21.985 --> 00:22:28.049
or more, surrounded by books,
the cultural arbiter of the

00:22:28.049 --> 00:22:33.470
English speaking world;
T.S. Eliot at sixty.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:39.161
That hair is now slicked down,
there are glasses between him

00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:42.084
and us.
This is the young man who's

00:22:42.084 --> 00:22:43.529
become a monument.
 

00:22:43.529 --> 00:22:46.130
But really, the costume's the
same one, right?

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:50.079
There's the handkerchief.
 

00:22:50.079 --> 00:22:54.803
Pound's descent into infamy and
insanity and indignity and

00:22:54.803 --> 00:22:59.029
Eliot's rise to the
extraordinary cultural power and

00:22:59.029 --> 00:23:04.001
prestige that he occupied and
that is represented by this and

00:23:04.001 --> 00:23:07.390
many other photos,
well, these are key stories in

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.910
modern poetry and they're
interestingly interlocking,

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:11.890
just as their two lives were.
 

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:15.150
 
 

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.740
Another modern poet.
 

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:25.171
This is an old woman called
Marianne Moore who became a kind

00:23:25.171 --> 00:23:30.839
of civic icon,
who became a celebrity even,

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:35.687
as an eccentric New Yorker who
wore tri-cornered hats and went

00:23:35.687 --> 00:23:40.466
to baseball games and the zoo,
and here appears in,

00:23:40.466 --> 00:23:46.279
well, her hair braided and
wrapped around her head;

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:50.824
fanciful, virginal,
kindly, safely out of fashion,

00:23:50.824 --> 00:23:56.203
full of a kind of civic virtue,
the embodiment of a certain

00:23:56.203 --> 00:23:59.450
kind of popular idea of poetry.
 

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.118
And you can't read it but
there's a kind of stamp of

00:24:03.118 --> 00:24:06.930
approval here from the governor
Nelson Rockefeller.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.624
Think of how far away this is
from Ezra Pound in St.

00:24:10.624 --> 00:24:12.289
Elizabeth's Hospital.
 

00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:15.170
This is another image of modern
poetry.

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:20.210
But Moore's hair was not always
done up.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:25.673
This is the image of a child,
also named Marianne Moore,

00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:29.150
with delicious,
prodigious locks.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:35.045
It reveals maybe a little bit
of the power and extravagance

00:24:35.045 --> 00:24:40.941
and glory that you feel in her
poems but that she preferred

00:24:40.941 --> 00:24:47.650
always to restrain and bind and
control in extraordinary ways,

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:51.599
and not always to hide.
 

00:24:51.599 --> 00:24:54.911
One of the enduring works
written in 1922,

00:24:54.911 --> 00:24:58.625
the amazing year that The
Waste Land and

00:24:58.625 --> 00:25:03.390
Ulysses appeared and
The Criterion started its

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:07.428
publication--one of those
amazing works is Marianne

00:25:07.428 --> 00:25:10.819
Moore's poem called
Poetry.

00:25:10.819 --> 00:25:14.380
You've got a sample of it on
your handout.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:20.552
Moore, who revised her poems,
just the same way she ended up

00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:24.824
binding her hair,
republished this poem

00:25:24.824 --> 00:25:30.699
eventually in short form,
very short, where three pages

00:25:30.699 --> 00:25:34.289
were reduced to two sentences.
 

00:25:34.289 --> 00:25:36.000
The first two sentences you
see:

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.877
I, too,
dislike it: there are things

00:25:38.877 --> 00:25:42.579
important
beyond all this fiddle.

00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:47.023
Reading it, however,
with a perfect contempt for it,

00:25:47.023 --> 00:25:51.990
one discovers in it after all,
a place for the genuine.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:56.179
Some of what she cut out of the
poem, cut out of its later

00:25:56.179 --> 00:26:00.589
version, is a list of what she
had in mind as the genuine,

00:26:00.589 --> 00:26:03.903
as examples of it,
which is the first quotation

00:26:03.903 --> 00:26:06.289
there;
again, on your handout:

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:09.711
The bat,
holding on upside down [and so

00:26:09.711 --> 00:26:12.050
on]
A flea, the base-

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.750
ball fan, the statistician--
nor is it valid

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:19.190
to discriminate against
"business documents and

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:23.573
school-books";
all of these phenomena are

00:26:23.573 --> 00:26:27.341
important.
The drive to include the

00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:32.224
world--Moore's omnivorous poems
claim for poetry all the

00:26:32.224 --> 00:26:36.398
subjects that she mentions here
and indeed many,

00:26:36.398 --> 00:26:39.668
many more.
All these are new,

00:26:39.668 --> 00:26:43.126
modern subjects.
Because they represent

00:26:43.126 --> 00:26:46.822
dimensions of experience
formerly excluded from the

00:26:46.822 --> 00:26:50.513
elevated,
idealized discourse that is

00:26:50.513 --> 00:26:56.119
poetry, dimensions of experience
excluded as prosaic.

00:26:56.119 --> 00:27:01.652
Moore is quoting here in that
phrase "business documents and

00:27:01.652 --> 00:27:05.778
school-books," as she tells us,
from Tolstoy,

00:27:05.778 --> 00:27:09.303
a prose writer.
But she goes further than

00:27:09.303 --> 00:27:13.140
Tolstoy in her commitment to the
seemingly non-poetic.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.465
She will not only include
Tolstoy's prose,

00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:21.331
she will not even discriminate
against business documents and

00:27:21.331 --> 00:27:26.255
school books.
Moore exemplifies in this way a

00:27:26.255 --> 00:27:32.660
key aspect of modern poetry--its
radical heterogeneity,

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:38.889
its will to mix many kinds of
materials and discourses,

00:27:38.889 --> 00:27:45.811
to make poetry reach out from
the rarified and limited domain

00:27:45.811 --> 00:27:53.079
of the poetic to keep including
more and more of the world.

00:27:53.079 --> 00:27:58.487
The next quotation on your
handout--this is another example

00:27:58.487 --> 00:28:02.317
of this.
I won't sing for you or give

00:28:02.317 --> 00:28:06.250
you my Italian,
but these famous lines,

00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:11.035
"London Bridge is falling down,
falling down,

00:28:11.035 --> 00:28:16.293
falling down" and so on,
these come from the conclusion

00:28:16.293 --> 00:28:19.019
to The Waste Land.
 

00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:23.907
They thrust together different
texts, different languages,

00:28:23.907 --> 00:28:27.680
writing from different
historical periods,

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:33.395
all there, compressed in that
remarkable mad song that

00:28:33.395 --> 00:28:35.660
concludes the poem.
 

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:40.688
In the next quotation,
Eliot tells us that a various

00:28:40.688 --> 00:28:44.424
and complex civilization,
such as ours,

00:28:44.424 --> 00:28:48.226
produces, he says,
various and complex results,

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:52.621
as if inevitably,
lest we think that there's

00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:59.158
anything particularly forced or
outlandish or willful about his

00:28:59.158 --> 00:29:05.591
own remarkable poetry in lines
such as those I just quoted for

00:29:05.591 --> 00:29:07.741
you.
Eliot was there,

00:29:07.741 --> 00:29:11.268
in that essay on the
metaphysical poets that I'm

00:29:11.268 --> 00:29:15.054
quoting from,
defending as necessary what is

00:29:15.054 --> 00:29:19.880
the primary characteristic,
not only of his own poetry,

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:25.440
but really of modern poetry
generally, what is often called

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.542
its difficulty.
Whatever else it may be,

00:29:28.542 --> 00:29:32.100
everyone's always agreed that
modern poetry is difficult.

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.759
You will probably too.
 

00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:38.010
By "difficult," it is meant,
I think, well,

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:42.498
first of all that it is in some
sense set apart from common

00:29:42.498 --> 00:29:46.530
speech,
as a specialized and highly

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:50.299
self-conscious use of language.
 

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:55.022
Eliot would go further and say
that there is no common form of

00:29:55.022 --> 00:29:58.119
modern speech,
and that's the problem.

00:29:58.119 --> 00:30:01.507
According to Eliot,
the modern world lacks a

00:30:01.507 --> 00:30:05.131
center, a kind of set of
collective beliefs and

00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:09.779
commitments that would enable
communication between us.

00:30:09.779 --> 00:30:12.397
Modernity for Eliot,
as for Moore,

00:30:12.397 --> 00:30:15.569
as for Pound,
is marked by a profusion of

00:30:15.569 --> 00:30:18.770
languages,
both national languages such as

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.940
French or Russian,
which turn up in The Waste

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:25.055
Land;
also, a bewildering array of

00:30:25.055 --> 00:30:29.008
specialized types of discourse,
technical genres,

00:30:29.008 --> 00:30:33.044
varieties of speech,
business documents and school

00:30:33.044 --> 00:30:37.778
books.
There's an extraordinary sense

00:30:37.778 --> 00:30:43.010
of verbal chaos,
a kind of word hoard that

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:48.369
modern poetry and
modernism--generally,

00:30:48.369 --> 00:30:52.748
a kind of linguistic
environment of great complexity

00:30:52.748 --> 00:30:56.869
from which modern poetry and
modernism emerge.

00:30:56.869 --> 00:31:02.099
This is an image called
"Rotterdam" by the artist Edward

00:31:02.099 --> 00:31:05.111
Wadsworth.
It's a woodcut image from

00:31:05.111 --> 00:31:07.799
Blast.
I like it because it's a kind

00:31:07.799 --> 00:31:11.361
of image of the modern city that
makes the modern city look like

00:31:11.361 --> 00:31:13.534
language,
look like letters,

00:31:13.534 --> 00:31:18.349
look like a kind of scattered
alphabet, a kind of babble.

00:31:18.349 --> 00:31:23.141
It's a kind of picture for me
of the linguistic environment,

00:31:23.141 --> 00:31:25.740
if you will,
of modern poetry.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:30.462
Behind this environment are the
great social processes of

00:31:30.462 --> 00:31:35.607
migration and modernization that
produced that new urban form,

00:31:35.607 --> 00:31:39.223
the metropolis.
All of the poets we read,

00:31:39.223 --> 00:31:42.686
even that New England hayseed,
Robert Frost,

00:31:42.686 --> 00:31:46.149
begin their careers in
metropolitan centers,

00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:49.210
primarily in London and New
York.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:53.599
"All that is solid melts into
air," Karl Marx said,

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:57.813
evoking the accelerating
transformation of modern

00:31:57.813 --> 00:32:00.359
economic and social life.
 

00:32:00.359 --> 00:32:04.755
The metropolis is the center of
this unsettled world that Marx

00:32:04.755 --> 00:32:07.770
describes.
Coming to the metropolis a

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:12.815
hundred or ninety years ago now
entailed, for the writers that

00:32:12.815 --> 00:32:16.089
we'll be reading,
as much as for anyone else,

00:32:16.089 --> 00:32:19.089
a kind of break with a world
that they had known,

00:32:19.089 --> 00:32:23.501
a break either with a native
language – this is what the

00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:27.913
emigrant or the expatriate
experiences – or perhaps with

00:32:27.913 --> 00:32:31.010
native ways of speaking and
knowing,

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:34.170
familiar spheres of reference.
 

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:38.670
Life in the modern metropolis
was de-familiarizing.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.809
It de-naturalized language.
 

00:32:41.809 --> 00:32:46.683
Where there are many languages
in use, language comes to seem

00:32:46.683 --> 00:32:51.720
arbitrary rather than natural,
as the product of convention;

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:56.070
not as something you're simply
born into but something that you

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.930
learn, something that is made
and that can be remade.

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.410
This is a presumption of all
the poets we'll be reading.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:10.192
Modern American writers and
artists immigrated famously to

00:33:10.192 --> 00:33:12.119
London, to Paris.
 

00:33:12.119 --> 00:33:15.796
Another key event in the making
of modernism is the great

00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:19.539
migration of African-Americans
from the rural south to the

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:23.066
urban north.
Langston Hughes's poetry comes

00:33:23.066 --> 00:33:27.935
out of this experience in a
community of black intellectuals

00:33:27.935 --> 00:33:31.980
and artists it created
specifically in Harlem.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:37.289
And you'll see on your handout
two quotations from poems by

00:33:37.289 --> 00:33:42.392
Hughes, the first,
"125^(th) Street," giving us

00:33:42.392 --> 00:33:49.871
well, here, images of black life
in the rural south transposed to

00:33:49.871 --> 00:33:52.741
Harlem.
There's in those images,

00:33:52.741 --> 00:33:56.569
I think, a kind of utopian
promise that the familiar,

00:33:56.569 --> 00:34:01.708
ordinary pleasures of rural
life can be recaptured in a new

00:34:01.708 --> 00:34:03.480
society of plenty.
 

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:07.007
But there's also something
hallucinatory and troubling

00:34:07.007 --> 00:34:11.199
about those images and vaguely
disturbing that's brought out,

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:15.123
I think, in the related,
famous poem,

00:34:15.123 --> 00:34:21.226
"Harlem," on the next side of
the page where if we've had

00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:28.440
faces as food in the first text,
something possibly reassuring,

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:34.911
those faces begin to look like
dangerous objectifications in

00:34:34.911 --> 00:34:42.369
the second one where that raisin
in the sun threatens to explode.

00:34:42.369 --> 00:34:45.675
Metropolis is,
in modern poetry,

00:34:45.675 --> 00:34:51.860
set against a backdrop of war
and violence and conflict,

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:57.955
and modern poetry,
as it absorbs the world of the

00:34:57.955 --> 00:35:04.940
metropolis, absorbs that
violence and energy as well.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:08.564
The metropolis,
well, it's a place of

00:35:08.564 --> 00:35:13.095
ambivalence, a place of promise
and of threat,

00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:16.719
of exultation and also of
dread.

00:35:16.719 --> 00:35:20.938
This ambivalence that I'm
describing is at the center of

00:35:20.938 --> 00:35:23.239
modern literature generally.
 

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:27.001
And the metropolis is crowded
with language,

00:35:27.001 --> 00:35:31.113
crowded with faces,
but there's also a pervasive

00:35:31.113 --> 00:35:35.838
sense of absence and of
loneliness and of loss captured

00:35:35.838 --> 00:35:41.000
also again paradigmatically in
The Waste Land,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.469
and I've included there more
lines from that poem.

00:35:45.469 --> 00:35:48.780
"The nymphs are departed,"
Eliot says.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:54.150
Eliot's speaking of a spiritual
and imaginative state.

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.575
Modern poetry arises,
in Eliot's case,

00:35:57.575 --> 00:36:02.390
with the death of God,
with the loss of a theological

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:08.467
justification for life,
with a sense of disenchantment,

00:36:08.467 --> 00:36:14.699
a sense of depletion,
depletion of meaning and value.

00:36:14.699 --> 00:36:18.853
The metropolis which uproots
people, takes them away,

00:36:18.853 --> 00:36:22.926
takes them out of traditional
cultures, also uproots

00:36:22.926 --> 00:36:26.679
traditional religious belief and
practices.

00:36:26.679 --> 00:36:30.138
Eliot's poetry,
the poetry he created out of

00:36:30.138 --> 00:36:34.159
this experience,
is a poetry of spiritual agony.

00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:37.031
Modernity is,
in his work,

00:36:37.031 --> 00:36:43.003
a condition of social and
psychological fragmentation

00:36:43.003 --> 00:36:49.042
which is both a private,
personal dilemma and a public

00:36:49.042 --> 00:36:51.670
one, as he understands it.
 

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:57.751
Compare to Eliot's city,
Eliot's sense of the city,

00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:01.212
this one.
This is a photograph by Alfred

00:37:01.212 --> 00:37:03.760
Stieglitz, City of
Ambition.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:10.325
This is the modern city,
not as a scene of fragmentation

00:37:10.325 --> 00:37:17.250
or despair, but rather a place
of ascent and aspiration.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:27.250
It's also a scene of crossings,
bridging past and future.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.240
This is a photo by another
American photographer,

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.920
Walker Evans,
a photo of Brooklyn Bridge.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.920
You recognize it.
 

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:41.475
And here is another,
another image by Evans of the

00:37:41.475 --> 00:37:45.107
bridge.
This one comes from a page of

00:37:45.107 --> 00:37:49.210
Hart Crane's epic poem
The Bridge,

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:54.419
and a book that you can go find
at the Beinecke,

00:37:54.419 --> 00:38:01.070
a remarkable edition of Crane's
poem where Evans's photos,

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.643
grand photos,
appear as almost miniature

00:38:04.643 --> 00:38:09.865
images surrounded by white
space, as you get some sense in

00:38:09.865 --> 00:38:13.373
this image.
In Crane, in his great poem

00:38:13.373 --> 00:38:17.639
The Bridge- and here's
another photo by Evans,

00:38:17.639 --> 00:38:20.934
this time of Crane on the
rooftop of the apartment

00:38:20.934 --> 00:38:24.295
building in Brooklyn,
110 Columbia Heights where he

00:38:24.295 --> 00:38:26.849
lived and where he began the
poem,

00:38:26.849 --> 00:38:29.690
with the bridge in the
background.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:34.965
In Crane, the emphasis is not
on what is lost in modernity but

00:38:34.965 --> 00:38:37.820
what is found or what might be.
 

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:42.478
Here's another quotation from
your handout,

00:38:42.478 --> 00:38:45.840
number 7:
New thresholds,

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.449
new anatomies,
wine talons

00:38:48.449 --> 00:38:51.840
Build freedom up about me and
distill

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:55.190
This competence to travel in a
tier

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:59.869
Sparkling alone within
another's will.

00:38:59.869 --> 00:39:05.750
Modern poetry is difficult and
these are difficult lines.

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:08.057
"New thresholds,
new anatomies",

00:39:08.057 --> 00:39:10.960
well, that's not such a hard
concept;

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.208
that's an image of what the
modern promises for Crane,

00:39:15.208 --> 00:39:19.296
and indeed those Gothic arches
of the bridge seem to

00:39:19.296 --> 00:39:21.219
emblematize for him.
 

00:39:21.219 --> 00:39:26.150
Yet, Crane's poetry in those
lines I just read really are

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.639
difficult, just as Eliot and
Pound are difficult,

00:39:30.639 --> 00:39:37.699
but not because as in those
poets Crane presents us with

00:39:37.699 --> 00:39:43.860
obscure references or languages
unknown to us,

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.349
or learned allusion.
 

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:51.974
Instead, what's difficult in
Crane is a kind of compression

00:39:51.974 --> 00:39:55.846
in his writing.
They show us a poet taking

00:39:55.846 --> 00:40:01.169
language apart and putting it
back together in new ways,

00:40:01.169 --> 00:40:04.750
new configurations,
new anatomies.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:07.699
Crane is full of mixed
metaphors;

00:40:07.699 --> 00:40:11.371
you're not supposed to mix your
metaphors and he does,

00:40:11.371 --> 00:40:14.510
all the time.
"Wine talons," there's one.

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.800
"Wine talons," what are they?
 

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.980
Well, think about it.
 

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:25.327
Perhaps you too have felt wine
talons grip you unexpectedly

00:40:25.327 --> 00:40:28.719
sometime and carry you aloft.
 

00:40:28.719 --> 00:40:35.408
The metaphor suggests ecstasy,
the exaltation of modern life,

00:40:35.408 --> 00:40:40.090
that aspiration imaged in
Stieglitz too.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:45.636
It suggests that ecstasy is
like wine, and wine is like an

00:40:45.636 --> 00:40:50.860
eagle clasping you;
it's prey in its claws.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:53.923
And keep in mind when Crane
wrote those lines too,

00:40:53.923 --> 00:40:57.300
it was illegal to buy and sell
wine in this country.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:02.958
modernity, in Crane's strange,
gorgeous poetry,

00:41:02.958 --> 00:41:08.124
is all about getting high,
about elevation,

00:41:08.124 --> 00:41:13.460
exultation.
Crane was an alcoholic.

00:41:13.460 --> 00:41:22.816
And if you study this photo,
you can see the qualities of a

00:41:22.816 --> 00:41:28.139
man struggling with alcoholism.
 

00:41:28.139 --> 00:41:34.052
This friendly and even
dignified face has prematurely

00:41:34.052 --> 00:41:38.199
white hair.
His cheeks are veined.

00:41:38.199 --> 00:41:43.970
Being drunk became for Crane a
kind of grim literalization of

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:48.010
the freedom that came with being
modern;

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:53.302
and that vision of freedom is
something that his poetry

00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:59.083
preserves for us and carries
forward for us and continues to

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:01.239
give us as a gift.
 

00:42:01.239 --> 00:42:06.638
Contrast his images of joyous
or demonic assent with the

00:42:06.638 --> 00:42:11.349
images of catastrophe,
of descent, of collapse in

00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:15.570
Eliot, "London Bridge is falling
down."

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:21.662
The decay of Christian belief
and practice is not a loss but

00:42:21.662 --> 00:42:26.309
rather an opportunity for
poetry, in Crane.

00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:30.829
He says in The Bridge,
he asks the bridge to lend a

00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:35.189
myth to God, and he suggests
that this is something that

00:42:35.189 --> 00:42:39.391
every age must do because our
names for God are always

00:42:39.391 --> 00:42:44.368
metaphors,
poems, something imagined,

00:42:44.368 --> 00:42:49.360
acts of speech.
Crane shares these general

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:52.280
ideas with Wallace Stevens.
 

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.298
This is Wallace Stevens,
Wallace Stevens who said,

00:42:56.298 --> 00:43:00.400
"Poetry is a means of
redemption", and meant it.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:06.290
Stevens began life as a
choirboy and as a Christian,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:12.411
but his work is all about
replacing Christian theology

00:43:12.411 --> 00:43:15.474
with poetry.
For Stevens,

00:43:15.474 --> 00:43:21.040
when modernity takes away God
what it does is unveil the

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.713
poet's Godlike powers,
a power to create the world

00:43:25.713 --> 00:43:29.603
through imagination,
imagination which created God

00:43:29.603 --> 00:43:31.349
in the first place.
 

00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:36.041
In Stevens, modernity shows us
that the truth of religion was

00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:39.090
always a fiction,
a fundamentally poetic

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.949
construction.
Stevens's world is secular and

00:43:42.949 --> 00:43:47.250
non-transcendental,
and he is fully at home in it,

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:54.699
so much so that he lives the
life of a bourgeois businessman,

00:43:54.699 --> 00:44:02.769
as an executive of the Hartford
Accident and Indemnity Company,

00:44:02.769 --> 00:44:08.780
a great Connecticut burger and
poet.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:12.873
Stevens celebrates the
bourgeois world over and over

00:44:12.873 --> 00:44:17.849
again in a poetry that is about
and itself enacts our perpetual

00:44:17.849 --> 00:44:22.665
recreation of reality through
the mind and its special medium

00:44:22.665 --> 00:44:27.200
– language.
Stevens understands tragedy,

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.899
but he is a comic poet,
a humanist who is concerned to

00:44:32.899 --> 00:44:36.340
preserve and exalt the human.
 

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.294
The relativity of truth,
the profusion of languages,

00:44:41.294 --> 00:44:46.734
these things that afflict Eliot
are a source of faith for

00:44:46.734 --> 00:44:50.978
Stevens.
Modern poetry seeks absolutes,

00:44:50.978 --> 00:44:56.828
what Moore calls the genuine,
what Crane calls the myth of

00:44:56.828 --> 00:45:01.550
America, the voice of the
thunder in Eliot;

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:08.345
Stevens's supreme fiction;
Pound's Cantos,

00:45:08.345 --> 00:45:11.127
a poem that would,
as he intended,

00:45:11.127 --> 00:45:14.336
include history.
Modern poetry is,

00:45:14.336 --> 00:45:18.211
in all these ways,
Promethean, astounding,

00:45:18.211 --> 00:45:22.369
arrogant, enormous,
imprudent, visionary.

00:45:22.369 --> 00:45:27.507
But it also contains other
positions, alternatives that

00:45:27.507 --> 00:45:32.739
open those over-sized cultural
ambitions to critique,

00:45:32.739 --> 00:45:39.820
to imaginative alternatives of
many kinds.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.891
And these are suggested,
I'll suggest briefly,

00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:47.511
by the last two poets we'll
read – W.H.

00:45:47.511 --> 00:45:51.764
Auden, to begin with here,
pictured as an Oxford

00:45:51.764 --> 00:45:54.750
undergraduate,
ever cheeky,

00:45:54.750 --> 00:46:01.704
who has written on the side of
his photo, "The cerebral life

00:46:01.704 --> 00:46:05.829
would pay," dry,
cool, pragmatic;

00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:12.179
and Elizabeth Bishop,
young in this glamorous George

00:46:12.179 --> 00:46:14.670
Platt Lynes photo.
 

00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:18.901
While modern poetry in many of
its forms strives to master

00:46:18.901 --> 00:46:22.746
reality, Auden reminds us,
there on your handout,

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:26.440
cautiously, that poetry makes
nothing happen.

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.539
While Stevens represents the
poet as a kind of God,

00:46:30.539 --> 00:46:34.230
Bishop sees the poet rather as
a sandpiper,

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:38.048
that little bird skittering
along the shore,

00:46:38.048 --> 00:46:42.309
not in control of the world but
subject to it,

00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:47.159
subject to its continual
fluctuation and awesome powers.

00:46:47.159 --> 00:46:50.978
Bishop's sandpiper poet,
there in your handout,

00:46:50.978 --> 00:46:54.878
is obsessed with the mere
details of experience,

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:57.949
those sand grains,
quartz grains.

00:46:57.949 --> 00:47:02.359
Her aim is to get along in a
world that is dominated by

00:47:02.359 --> 00:47:06.850
shifting forces that can be
registered and reacted to by

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:09.300
poetry, but not explained.
 

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.710
This is, I think,
really also a version of poetic

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:19.314
activity that has some sources
in and has a lot in common with

00:47:19.314 --> 00:47:25.350
Robert Frost's,
as we will see on Monday.

00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:27.000
Thank you.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.348
Prof: I want to return
briefly to "desenga

00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:08.417
ño,"
because there may be some

00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:11.622
confusion caused by
"disillusionment,"

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:15.100
the English word used to
translate the term,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.350
which is an approximation as
all translations are.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.828
"Disillusionment"
can mean in English

00:00:25.828 --> 00:00:30.139
"disenchantment"
and "disappointment,"

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:34.450
words that have a very negative
connotation whereas,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.039
"desenga
ño"

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.810
does not quite have that
connotation.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.388
At worst, it could mean
"resignation,"

00:00:42.388 --> 00:00:45.510
meaning,
I was resigned to find out that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.544
such-and-such a person was not
as good as I thought him or her

00:00:49.544 --> 00:00:50.140
to be.
 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.190
Remember the quote from Otis
Green that I read you,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.707
in which "desenga
ño"

00:01:01.707 --> 00:01:06.328
was thought of as the summum
bonum,

00:01:06.328 --> 00:01:11.218
the ultimate good desired by
the stoic wise man.

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:16.680
Baroque desengaño
is a positive condition at which

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.793
the individual arrives after
having shed the scales from his

00:01:21.793 --> 00:01:25.424
eyes--
remember?--and learned of the

00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:31.052
deceitfulness of appearances of
the mystifying allure of all

00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:35.250
that he has taken as being very
valuable.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.560
Everything that shines is not
gold,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.199
is what the individual learns,
having gone through the process

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:44.578
of engaño,
that is deceit and

00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:48.330
desengaño,
to put it in the simplest of

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.989
terms.
 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.891
What I suggested,
moreover, is that the plot of

00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:57.980
the Quixote and that of
some of these stories embedded

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.730
in it in this Part II go through
a similar unfolding from

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.310
engaño to
desengaño.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.346
We will be following this
development in the episodes that

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:17.560
we will be dealing with during
the rest of the semester,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.604
some of which are the
culminating episodes in the

00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:24.961
entire book,
not only of the second part,

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:27.280
but the entire Quixote.
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.297
But let us first turn our
attention today to two critics

00:02:33.297 --> 00:02:38.111
whose essays you are reading
this week in the

00:02:38.111 --> 00:02:43.276
Casebook,
and this is sort of the

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:47.795
highlight, or the high point,
I should say,

00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:51.401
of the Casebook,
these two essays by Auerbach

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:52.490
and Spitzer.
 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:01.430
Now, we already saw Auerbach's
main thesis in Mimesis,

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.875
his famous book,
and that that thesis is about

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:11.801
the Christian mixture of the
sublime and the low style in the

00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.729
New Testament,
and how this led to the

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:20.810
emergence and development of
realism and eventually to the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.000
novel and to a book like the
Quixote.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.113
This mixture of the sublime and
low style was a break away from

00:03:31.113 --> 00:03:36.437
the strict separation between
high and low style in the

00:03:36.437 --> 00:03:41.169
classical tradition which
Auerbach derives--

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:42.940
this idea--from St.
 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.228
Augustine and the church
fathers, the patristic

00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:48.440
tradition.
 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.989
Auerbach labels sermo
humilis--I put it on the

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.860
board--or humble sermon,
or better, humble discourse.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.643
This Christian response to the
classical division of styles

00:04:05.643 --> 00:04:08.127
derived--
that division of

00:04:08.127 --> 00:04:12.901
styles--derived from Aristotle
and from Roman rhetorical

00:04:12.901 --> 00:04:13.770
theory.
 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.507
This mixture of the
transcendent and the low style

00:04:18.507 --> 00:04:22.278
was exemplified by Christ's
passion,

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:25.639
through which the drama of
man's every day life assumes the

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.651
most profound meaning:
life does not end in the brief

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:32.716
span of worldly existence;
eternity is present in the

00:04:32.716 --> 00:04:35.399
passion as a message of hope.
 

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:40.273
Now, Auerbach's application of
this theory to the

00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:45.815
Quixote leads him to the
belief that the Quixote

00:04:45.815 --> 00:04:51.889
is essentially a funny book,
as you have read the essay,

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.459
"The Enchanted
Dulcinea"

00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:01.190
an interpretation for which
Auerbach was excoriated by

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.233
Hispanists,
particularly,

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:08.307
Spanish ones,
for whom the Quixote was

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:12.290
a very profound and
transcendental book.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.382
Although many were motivated by
a nationalistic interpretation

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:21.129
of Cervantes,
whom they saw as the highest

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.608
example of Spanish genius,
and his protagonist as the very

00:05:24.608 --> 00:05:27.240
representative of the
fatherland,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.110
they were not entirely wrong in
their reactions.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:35.088
What happened in Spain was that
the Quixote was

00:05:35.088 --> 00:05:38.202
canonized,
meaning, turned into a classic

00:05:38.202 --> 00:05:41.892
in the eighteenth century,
and then, by the early

00:05:41.892 --> 00:05:45.843
nineteenth century,
during the romantic period,

00:05:45.843 --> 00:05:50.538
it was exalted as the highest
point of Spanish genius and the

00:05:50.538 --> 00:05:54.529
highest representative of the
Spanish language,

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.110
in which the spirit of
Spanishness was embedded,

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.336
and so forth,
and this was a very

00:06:02.336 --> 00:06:06.649
nationalistic reading of the
Quixote that prevailed,

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:09.310
and still prevails,
in some quarters.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.970
And so, the people who held
this view of the Quixote,

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.961
of course, were outraged by
Auerbach's reading of the

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:22.009
Quixote as essentially a
funny book.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.680
They were not entirely wrong in
their reactions.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.430
It should be very clear to
those of you reading the

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.607
Quixote that there is a
great deal that is very deep and

00:06:34.607 --> 00:06:38.146
serious in it both about life
and general and about

00:06:38.146 --> 00:06:39.350
literature.
 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.480
Auerbach's analysis,
however, is very revealing of

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.786
how the low style,
particularly in Sancho and

00:06:46.786 --> 00:06:50.216
other low class characters plays
such a crucial role in the

00:06:50.216 --> 00:06:52.759
farcical episodes in the
Quixote.

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:57.507
Besides, we are not familiar in
the modern period any more with

00:06:57.507 --> 00:07:00.826
this separation of styles,
of high and low styles or

00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:03.632
anything like that,
and it's very instructive to

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:07.095
read Auerbach,
who was steeped in that,

00:07:07.095 --> 00:07:12.920
even when he goes astray,
in my view.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.737
I was criticized by some
Hispanists for having included

00:07:16.737 --> 00:07:19.069
that essay in the
Casebook,

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:23.170
by the way, mostly because they
had not been included.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:30.497
Auerbach's problem is that he
cannot get out of his scheme,

00:07:30.497 --> 00:07:36.310
which equates seriousness only
with tragedy.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.810
Don Quixote can be serious
without being tragic,

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.935
and, in fact,
this is one of his most

00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:44.949
important lessons and most
innovative qualities,

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:47.997
one of the most innovative
qualities of the new literature

00:07:47.997 --> 00:07:50.620
that emerges in the wake of
the Quixote.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.769
To say that Cervantes does not
deal with the serious issues of

00:07:55.769 --> 00:07:59.569
his time is pure nonsense,
as we have seen.

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:04.884
To claim that the book is,
above all, a farce is also

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:06.009
nonsense.
 

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:11.524
Besides, a novel's worth should
not be gauged by how faithfully

00:08:11.524 --> 00:08:16.060
it represents reality,
if such a thing can be gauged

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.040
at all.
 

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.536
Auerbach is wrong when he says
that Don Quixote's

00:08:20.536 --> 00:08:24.250
idée fixe has no
contact with reality,

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.019
and that it only causes
confusion.

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:31.240
On the contrary,
his idée fixe

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.740
serves by contrast to clarify
many things around him,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.070
but there are salvageable parts
of Auerbach's essay,

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.190
which is why I included it in
the Casebook.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:51.279
Nabokov, on the other hand,
the great Russian novelist,

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.960
has a horrible book on the
Quixote,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.360
which was a series of lectures
that he gave at Harvard.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:00.690
And the book is interesting
only because Nabokov wrote it,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.346
but he says really outrageous
things like there is no

00:09:04.346 --> 00:09:07.933
reflection of the Spain of
Cervantes' time in the

00:09:07.933 --> 00:09:09.059
Quixote.
 

00:09:09.059 --> 00:09:11.470
What?
 

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.590
Nabokov was a great writer,
but not a great critic,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:14.100
obviously.
 

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:19.691
I think that the first
salvageable thing in Auerbach's

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:25.494
essay is his reaction against
romantic criticism and the

00:09:25.494 --> 00:09:31.500
tendency to over interpret,
whatever that means, ultimately.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.774
Auerbach writes defining his
own position the following--you

00:09:35.774 --> 00:09:38.889
have it in the Casebook,
page 58:

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:42.142
"For centuries, [he says]--
and especially since the

00:09:42.142 --> 00:09:45.416
romanticists--
many things have been read into

00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:49.710
him [into Cervantes]
which he hardly foreboded,

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.220
let alone intended.
 

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.389
Such transforming and
transcendent interpretations are

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:56.649
often fertile.
 

00:09:56.649 --> 00:10:00.042
A book like Don Quixote
disassociates itself from its

00:10:00.042 --> 00:10:02.860
author's intention and leads a
life of its own.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.677
Don Quixote shows a new
face to every age which enjoys

00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:07.058
him.
 

00:10:07.058 --> 00:10:10.457
Yet the historian--whose task
[meaning himself]

00:10:10.457 --> 00:10:14.447
it is to define the place of a
given work in historical

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.754
continuity--
must endeavor insofar as that

00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:22.407
is possible,
to attain a clear understanding

00:10:22.407 --> 00:10:27.437
of what the book meant to its
author and his

00:10:27.437 --> 00:10:29.894
contemporaries."
 

00:10:29.894 --> 00:10:31.298
Unquote.
 

00:10:31.298 --> 00:10:34.754
This is the dream of the
philologians and the critics

00:10:34.754 --> 00:10:38.407
steeped in philology,
that they can actually get back

00:10:38.407 --> 00:10:42.057
to the meaning of the work in
the period in which he was

00:10:42.057 --> 00:10:46.039
writing and to discern what the
author's intentions were.

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:49.428
We are not so sure any more.
 

00:10:49.428 --> 00:10:54.437
Peter Russell's book--Peter
Russell was an English hispanist

00:10:54.437 --> 00:10:57.514
of some note;
his book is called Don

00:10:57.514 --> 00:11:02.105
Quixote as a Funny Book--
follows Auerbach and is among

00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:06.957
those who styled themselves as
the hard school of Cervantes

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:10.912
criticism,
based mostly in England,

00:11:10.912 --> 00:11:17.870
and whose hardness is mostly of
the intellectual arteries,

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:19.668
in my view.
 

00:11:19.668 --> 00:11:24.514
Just because Cervantes
contemporaries found the book

00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:26.495
funny,
or just because of what

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:29.626
Cervantes said about the comic,
it is impoverishing to see

00:11:29.626 --> 00:11:31.668
the Quixote in this
light,

00:11:31.668 --> 00:11:34.820
particularly when the comic is
not defined.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.538
If the comic arises,
as it does in the

00:11:37.538 --> 00:11:39.993
Quixote,
from the toils of a mind out of

00:11:39.993 --> 00:11:43.976
sorts with the modern world,
then it is a comic of the

00:11:43.976 --> 00:11:46.990
highest form of seriousness.
 

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:52.905
Comedy can be very serious and
profound, and it is in the

00:11:52.905 --> 00:11:54.308
Quixote.
 

00:11:54.308 --> 00:11:59.399
Contemporaries often misread
works written in their time,

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:03.649
obviously, and authors'
intentions are very,

00:12:03.649 --> 00:12:08.823
very difficult to ascertain,
and I'll say a little bit more

00:12:08.823 --> 00:12:10.519
about that later.
 

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:14.929
Spitzer, Leo Spitzer,
was another great critic of the

00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:17.389
German philological school.
 

00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:22.546
He, too, escaped from Nazi
Germany, and preceded Auerbach

00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:26.690
in the chair at the University
of Istanbul.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:32.668
Spitzer wound up at Johns
Hopkins University;

00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:34.980
not at Yale,
alas, like Auerbach.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.748
Spitzer was known to be
irascible and belligerent in the

00:12:40.748 --> 00:12:46.346
defense of his points of view,
and wrote vicious reviews of

00:12:46.346 --> 00:12:49.019
the books with which he
disagreed.

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:53.648
For example,
Stephen Gilman's book on The

00:12:53.648 --> 00:13:00.000
Celestina was shredded by
Spitzer in an angry review.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.591
Spitzer was more thoroughly
grounded in philology and

00:13:06.591 --> 00:13:10.139
linguistics than Auerbach.
 

00:13:10.139 --> 00:13:15.604
He was a philologist and a
linguist, and spoke many modern

00:13:15.604 --> 00:13:21.259
languages and knew practically
all of the classical ones.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:23.491
He was a very,
very, very learned man,

00:13:23.491 --> 00:13:24.759
and very brilliant.
 

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:29.508
Spitzer believes that one can
get at the core of a work of

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:33.590
literature by going from
something marginal on the

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.644
periphery,
like a detail,

00:13:35.644 --> 00:13:38.120
and pursuing it all the way to
its center;

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.474
that a detail can,
if properly analyzed,

00:13:41.474 --> 00:13:45.860
yield a comprehensive
interpretation of the work.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:49.980
The geometric metaphors
periphery, circle,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.600
center, are a bit naïve
here.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.293
We use metaphors in writing
theory and in writing criticism,

00:13:58.293 --> 00:14:02.750
and his are a bit naïve
when we think about them.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:07.399
We learned to look for
metaphors in criticism through

00:14:07.399 --> 00:14:11.961
the work of the great
deconstructionist Paul de Man,

00:14:11.961 --> 00:14:15.269
who was a professor here at
Yale.

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:19.610
So the geometric metaphors are
a bit naïve as is Spitzer's

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:23.740
emphasis on discovering the
personality of the author or his

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.903
worldview,
his Weltanschauung to

00:14:26.903 --> 00:14:29.585
use the German word;
he wants to get at the

00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:30.879
psychology of the author.
 

00:14:30.879 --> 00:14:36.793
These are approximations that
Michel Foucault--I think I have

00:14:36.793 --> 00:14:42.743
mentioned him;
he is a French philosopher and

00:14:42.743 --> 00:14:46.323
theoretician,
whose most famous book is

00:14:46.323 --> 00:14:50.291
Les mots et les choses,
in English translated as The

00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:53.240
Order of Things,
and the first three chapters on

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.996
Hispanic things;
one on Velázquez,

00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:57.440
Las Meninas;
one on Cervantes;

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.480
and the beginning is on Borges,
the Argentine writer.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.668
These are approximations,
and Michel Foucault would argue

00:15:04.668 --> 00:15:07.970
that one limits the possible
meanings of a work by reducing

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.590
it to the alleged intention of
its author.

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.009
If you say, these were these
the author's intentions,

00:15:14.009 --> 00:15:16.970
you create kind of a fence
around a work,

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:22.942
and there can be no meanings
beyond what you assume those

00:15:22.942 --> 00:15:24.970
intentions to be.
 

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:30.644
But I believe that what Spitzer
is trying to find is the

00:15:30.644 --> 00:15:33.708
Cervantean,
it's what I call the

00:15:33.708 --> 00:15:38.649
Cervantean, which to him is a
point of confluence between form

00:15:38.649 --> 00:15:43.590
and content that makes for a
coherent overarching meaning.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.812
Since language is,
after all, the primary material

00:15:47.812 --> 00:15:51.719
of a literary work,
I believe that Spitzer's work

00:15:51.719 --> 00:15:55.182
is a good lesson to critics who
would leap to hasty

00:15:55.182 --> 00:15:59.340
interpretations without a
detailed knowledge of the text.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.967
Now, that language is the
primary material of a literary

00:16:03.967 --> 00:16:09.815
work might seem obvious,
but it is a very complicated

00:16:09.815 --> 00:16:14.203
statement to make,
because one could say that

00:16:14.203 --> 00:16:17.308
paint is the primary material of
painting,

00:16:17.308 --> 00:16:18.970
and that doesn't get you very
far.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:23.748
In the case of language I think
that it does,

00:16:23.748 --> 00:16:29.721
not as far as Spitzer would
believe, but I think that it

00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:30.700
does.
 

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.037
In the case of the
Quixote, Spitzer

00:16:34.037 --> 00:16:38.759
accomplishes his task by
meticulous work on polynomasia.

00:16:38.759 --> 00:16:42.791
You have these words in your
essays, so I don't have to put

00:16:42.791 --> 00:16:45.432
them on the board,
I know that they are

00:16:45.432 --> 00:16:48.558
jawbreakers: polynomasia,
multiple names;

00:16:48.558 --> 00:16:52.100
and polyetymology,
multiple origins of words,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.885
meaning multiplicity of names
and multiplicity of word origins

00:16:55.885 --> 00:16:58.990
that are present in the scenes
that he analyzes.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:05.009
Spitzer equates the
multiplicity implicit in these--

00:17:05.009 --> 00:17:09.284
in the words--to the
perspectivism inherent in the

00:17:09.284 --> 00:17:14.778
interplay of varied views in the
novel by various characters.

00:17:14.778 --> 00:17:17.250
Various characters and various
different points of view,

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.757
and this is reflected in the
multiplicity of etymologists and

00:17:21.757 --> 00:17:25.813
in the multiplicity of names
given to characters and to

00:17:25.813 --> 00:17:26.640
things.
 

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:33.000
The differences of opinion
among the characters is evinced

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.348
through the use of language.
 

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:41.196
The key term in the novel is
the portmanteau word Sancho uses

00:17:41.196 --> 00:17:45.558
to mediate in the dispute about
the barber's basin,

00:17:45.558 --> 00:17:49.630
the "baciyelmo,"
or the basin helmet,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.001
in English, by which he
attempts to convey the

00:17:53.001 --> 00:17:56.450
conflicting points of view about
the object.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.190
According to Webster's,
a portmanteau word,

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.759
and James Joyce was famous for
making them up,

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:08.994
is a word that is a combination
of two other words in form and

00:18:08.994 --> 00:18:12.157
meaning,
like the word "smog,"

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:15.163
which is a combination of
"smoke"

00:18:15.163 --> 00:18:16.808
and "fog."
 

00:18:16.808 --> 00:18:19.662
I bet you didn't know that:
"smoke"

00:18:19.662 --> 00:18:22.579
and "fog"
give you "smog,"

00:18:22.579 --> 00:18:24.848
and that is a portmanteau word.
 

00:18:24.848 --> 00:18:33.839
Joyce uses them in funny ways,
a passenger in Joyce is the

00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:43.461
"pas encore,"
which in French means "not

00:18:43.461 --> 00:18:45.670
yet."
 

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:46.529
Of course, a
"passenger"

00:18:46.529 --> 00:18:47.387
is a "pas
encore"

00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:48.430
because he hasn't gotten there
yet,

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.480
and this is the kind of thing
that Joyce does.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.625
So that's a portmanteau word,
and a

00:18:52.625 --> 00:18:55.278
"baciyelmo,"
basin helmet,

00:18:55.278 --> 00:18:56.920
is a portmanteau word.
 

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:00.890
Now, you remember that Spitzer
makes quite a bit of that.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:08.112
But Spitzer argues behind his
multiplicity there is Cervantes,

00:19:08.112 --> 00:19:13.440
the creator of this whole
artistic machine.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.903
He stands over all of the games
of authorship and all of the

00:19:18.903 --> 00:19:19.828
ironies.
 

00:19:19.828 --> 00:19:25.130
That is, you can think of it as
Cervantes,

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.404
and then all of the polynomasia
and all of the polyetymology and

00:19:28.404 --> 00:19:31.855
all that,
but they are contained in this

00:19:31.855 --> 00:19:36.221
figure of Cervantes,
the author, who is the author

00:19:36.221 --> 00:19:39.858
of all of the ironies and all of
these games.

00:19:39.858 --> 00:19:43.942
Cervantes, Spitzer argues,
is no relativist when it comes

00:19:43.942 --> 00:19:46.742
to morals--
we saw this already--and

00:19:46.742 --> 00:19:50.605
perspectivism and irony are
inherent in a Christian

00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:53.509
position,
which is humble by definition,

00:19:53.509 --> 00:19:56.980
meaning I don't know enough,
I will never know enough, too.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.724
Behind Cervantes,
the creator,

00:19:59.724 --> 00:20:03.890
there is God,
whom Cervantes never denies.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.838
So there will be God above
Cervantes.

00:20:07.838 --> 00:20:13.328
Spitzer provides a convincing
historical scheme.

00:20:13.328 --> 00:20:18.193
During the Middle Ages,
there is a correspondence

00:20:18.193 --> 00:20:22.755
between word and things,
names and characters,

00:20:22.755 --> 00:20:27.618
and this is so in the readings
of scripture.

00:20:27.618 --> 00:20:35.688
In the Renaissance that is a
word-world, a world of words,

00:20:35.688 --> 00:20:40.358
to use my own portmanteau word.
 

00:20:40.358 --> 00:20:42.628
A world of words,
one connecting or leading to

00:20:42.628 --> 00:20:45.547
the next by metonymy,
and a world-book,

00:20:45.547 --> 00:20:50.464
a world made up of books,
like Alonso Quijano's,

00:20:50.464 --> 00:20:54.018
who, as a result,
becomes Don Quixote by

00:20:54.018 --> 00:20:57.838
inhabiting that book world or
that world of books.

00:20:57.838 --> 00:21:02.553
In the Baroque there is a
phantasmagoria of words that are

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:06.355
like dreams and reveal the
deceit of the world,

00:21:06.355 --> 00:21:08.920
including that of language.
 

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.474
Here, in this world of
desengaño is where

00:21:13.474 --> 00:21:17.440
we find Cervantes,
particularly the Cervantes of

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.200
1615.
 

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:23.121
So I put these things on the
board because I like you to have

00:21:23.121 --> 00:21:24.269
clear ideas.
 

00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:28.598
So Middle Ages,
Renaissance and Baroque;

00:21:28.598 --> 00:21:31.711
correspondence:
word things,

00:21:31.711 --> 00:21:38.626
words to words and then words
who are deceitful and purveyors

00:21:38.626 --> 00:21:44.905
of engaño,
and then leading to

00:21:44.905 --> 00:21:48.769
desengaño.
 

00:21:48.769 --> 00:21:54.336
Now, I am very interested,
because I think it is useful

00:21:54.336 --> 00:21:59.799
for us as readers and as
students of literature in the

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:03.989
Cervantean,
according to Auerbach and

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:09.371
Spitzer--to me the most
interesting part of Auerbach's

00:22:09.371 --> 00:22:15.769
essay is ultimately when he
tries to define the Cervantean,

00:22:15.769 --> 00:22:18.132
"lo
cervantino,"

00:22:18.132 --> 00:22:22.193
which can be compared with
Spitzer's effort to come to a

00:22:22.193 --> 00:22:24.038
similar overall view.
 

00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:29.566
Theoreticians and critics can
say that there is no such thing

00:22:29.566 --> 00:22:32.788
as the Cervantean,
yet, there is.

00:22:32.788 --> 00:22:38.811
You know, if you have read
the Quixote and you know

00:22:38.811 --> 00:22:43.566
literary history,
you know what belongs to the

00:22:43.566 --> 00:22:45.680
Cervantes world.
 

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:51.891
Or a great writer creates a
world of his or her own,

00:22:51.891 --> 00:22:56.030
it's a set of plots,
ideas, tropes,

00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:02.730
that has some coherence and
that can be identified.

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:06.950
If you have read Proust,
you know what I mean.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:10.710
You read one proustian
sentence, his long flowing

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.548
sentences, and you know
immediately you're reading

00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:15.410
Proust.
 

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:19.190
You read a sentence by Borges,
with his refined irony,

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.390
and you know you're reading
Borges,

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:27.000
or you read: "Years later,
before the firing squad Colonel

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.084
Aureliano Buendia was to
remember that remote afternoon

00:23:30.084 --> 00:23:32.940
when his grandfather took him to
see ice."

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:36.663
This is the beginning of One
Hundred Years of Solitude,

00:23:36.663 --> 00:23:37.578
and you know.
 

00:23:37.578 --> 00:23:44.200
Now, Auerbach in defining the
Cervantean begins by giving up.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.766
He says: "The 'peculiarly
Cervantean' cannot be described

00:23:47.766 --> 00:23:48.759
in words."
 

00:23:48.759 --> 00:23:50.548
He begins by giving up.
 

00:23:50.548 --> 00:23:53.570
But then he says:
"First of all it is

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.919
something spontaneously sensory:
a vigorous capacity for the

00:23:57.919 --> 00:24:02.192
vivid visualization of very
different people in very varied

00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:05.571
situations,
for the vivid realization and

00:24:05.571 --> 00:24:08.970
expression of what thoughts
enter their minds,

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.443
what emotions fill their hearts
and what words come to their

00:24:12.443 --> 00:24:13.210
lips."
 

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:16.327
You have to remember that these
quotes from Auerbach were

00:24:16.327 --> 00:24:20.597
originally written in German,
and German prose is very

00:24:20.597 --> 00:24:24.548
complicated,
and it shows in the translation.

00:24:24.548 --> 00:24:27.631
Later, he says:
"And just as sensory is

00:24:27.631 --> 00:24:31.430
his capacity [Cervantes']
to think up or hit upon ever

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:34.868
new combinations of people and
events."

00:24:34.868 --> 00:24:38.159
I think he's right,
when he says something like

00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:38.660
that.
 

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.019
He goes back,
Auerbach goes back to the idea

00:24:42.019 --> 00:24:45.460
of the mad gentleman running
into people,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.109
and he says:
"What attracted Cervantes

00:24:49.109 --> 00:24:51.978
was the possibility [this
formula]

00:24:51.978 --> 00:24:57.279
offered for multifariousness
and effects of perspective,

00:24:57.279 --> 00:25:00.798
the mixture of the fanciful and
every day elements in the

00:25:00.798 --> 00:25:02.980
subject,
its malleability,

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.701
elasticity, adaptability."
 

00:25:05.701 --> 00:25:06.578
Unquote.
 

00:25:06.578 --> 00:25:10.076
He finally proclaims the
following: "[The

00:25:10.076 --> 00:25:12.410
Cervantean]
is an attitude--

00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:16.448
an attitude towards the world,
and hence also towards the

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:21.136
subject matter of his art--
in which bravery and equanimity

00:25:21.136 --> 00:25:22.730
play a major part.
 

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.766
Together with the delight he
takes in the multifariousness of

00:25:26.766 --> 00:25:31.071
his sensory play there is in him
a certain southern [here meaning

00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:36.498
Southern European,
not Faulknerian south]

00:25:36.498 --> 00:25:40.200
reticence and pride.
 

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.900
This prevents him from taking
the play very seriously.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.039
He looks at it;
he shapes it;

00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:51.113
he finds it diverting;
it is also intended to afford

00:25:51.113 --> 00:25:53.663
the reader refined intellectual
diversion."

00:25:53.663 --> 00:25:54.259
Unquote.
 

00:25:54.259 --> 00:25:56.400
He goes back over this.
 

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.355
He says: "The theme of the
mad country gentleman who

00:25:59.355 --> 00:26:01.993
undertakes to revive
knight-errantry gave Cervantes

00:26:01.993 --> 00:26:04.578
an opportunity to present the
world as play,

00:26:04.578 --> 00:26:07.990
in that spirit of multiple
perspective,

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.778
non-judging and even
non-questioning neutrality,

00:26:11.778 --> 00:26:14.920
which is a brave form of
wisdom."

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:19.287
There is something,
I think, also quite perceptive

00:26:19.287 --> 00:26:20.000
there.
 

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.490
That is, that Cervantes is like
a puppet master,

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:29.868
like Master Pedro in the
episode you're about to read,

00:26:29.868 --> 00:26:34.696
and he presents all of these
many different characters in

00:26:34.696 --> 00:26:37.551
action,
and sort of stands back without

00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:38.710
passing judgment.
 

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.532
Now, Spitzer,
on the other hand,

00:26:42.532 --> 00:26:48.700
concludes the following:
"This means that,

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:51.756
in our novel,
things are represented not for

00:26:51.756 --> 00:26:56.661
what they are in themselves,
but only as things spoken about

00:26:56.661 --> 00:27:00.545
or thought about;
and this involves breaking the

00:27:00.545 --> 00:27:04.250
narrative presentation into two
points of view.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:09.048
There can be no certainty about
the 'unbroken' reality of

00:27:09.048 --> 00:27:11.962
events;
the only unquestionable truth

00:27:11.962 --> 00:27:16.323
on which the reader may depend
is the will of the artist who

00:27:16.323 --> 00:27:20.239
chose to break up a multivalent
reality into different

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:21.568
perspectives.
 

00:27:21.568 --> 00:27:25.108
In other words,
perspectivism suggests the

00:27:25.108 --> 00:27:29.942
existence of an Archimedean
principle [something on which

00:27:29.942 --> 00:27:34.950
the whole thing rests]
outside the plot [he goes on]--

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:39.066
and the Archimedes must be
Cervantes himself."

00:27:39.066 --> 00:27:39.890
Unquote.
 

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.178
And one more quote:
"And we may see in

00:27:43.178 --> 00:27:47.561
Cervantes' two-fold treatment of
the problem of nicknames

00:27:47.561 --> 00:27:51.007
[polynomasia]
another example of this baroque

00:27:51.007 --> 00:27:53.492
attitude,
what is true,

00:27:53.492 --> 00:27:58.016
what is a dream?--this time,
toward language [language

00:27:58.016 --> 00:27:58.618
itself].
 

00:27:58.618 --> 00:28:01.328
Is not human language,
also, vanitas vanitatum?

00:28:01.328 --> 00:28:04.296
[vanity of vanities,
what I was saying about the

00:28:04.296 --> 00:28:07.200
Baroque language is a
phantasmagoria]."

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:14.285
This is the end of Spitzer's
synthesis, his conclusion after

00:28:14.285 --> 00:28:21.130
this very thorough and brilliant
analysis of the novel.

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:26.786
This is my view--I have been
expressing it already--this is

00:28:26.786 --> 00:28:30.588
my view both on Auerbach and
Spitzer.

00:28:30.588 --> 00:28:34.459
In the glorification of the
author, Spitzer does not take

00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:36.740
into account Cervantes' errors.
 

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:43.210
His famous oversights which
bespeak of a flawed creator,

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:49.500
not God-like in any sense,
hence, pushing the whole issue

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:55.788
of point of view to the edge of
the abyss of madness,

00:28:55.788 --> 00:28:59.328
since the final authority is
flawed.

00:28:59.328 --> 00:29:05.432
Moreover, Cervantes plays so
much with the author's lack of

00:29:05.432 --> 00:29:11.642
authority that one has finally
to take him at face value and

00:29:11.642 --> 00:29:18.165
agree that not even he has the
final authority of the book that

00:29:18.165 --> 00:29:19.640
we read.
 

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.939
And I think this,
he would have agreed with,

00:29:22.939 --> 00:29:27.160
and we have seen it in our
readings of many passages.

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:29.900
The same is true for Auerbach.
 

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.880
My answer, as you will see in
my essays, is Ginés

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.420
cross-eyedness.
 

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.220
Remember that Ginés is a
figure of the author,

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.160
and a figure of the modern
author.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.452
He has pawned his book,
he wants to make money from it,

00:29:44.452 --> 00:29:46.160
he's from the low classes.
 

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.463
He's cross-eyed and this
reveals that there is

00:29:49.463 --> 00:29:53.210
perspectivism from within an
assumed single self.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:56.858
That is, that this figure of
the author here,

00:29:56.858 --> 00:30:03.578
cannot be in possession of the
truth because being cross-eyed--

00:30:03.578 --> 00:30:06.009
I don't know if I can make
enough cross-eyed--

00:30:06.009 --> 00:30:14.598
here, his view of reality is
flawed and conflictive.

00:30:14.598 --> 00:30:18.368
Conflictive because there are
two eyes,

00:30:18.368 --> 00:30:23.125
not a single point of view,
and this author figure being

00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:28.571
cross-eyed makes literally that
his two eyes means two different

00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:29.608
visions.
 

00:30:29.608 --> 00:30:34.694
We will talk about that,
when we talk about the puppet

00:30:34.694 --> 00:30:38.820
play that Ginés de
Pasamonte puts on,

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.740
here in Part II.
 

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:47.338
So the author is multiple
within himself,

00:30:47.338 --> 00:30:50.009
his eyes work independently of
each other,

00:30:50.009 --> 00:30:54.231
as it were, he is congenitally
incapable of providing a single

00:30:54.231 --> 00:30:55.338
point of view.
 

00:30:55.338 --> 00:31:00.680
Now we turn to the assigned
episodes in the Quixote.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.599
As we turn to these episodes,
let me remind you that I will

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:11.028
be looking into how much each
resembles an episode in Part I,

00:31:11.028 --> 00:31:16.724
to what extent these episodes
are rewritings of others that

00:31:16.724 --> 00:31:21.338
have all ready taken place in
the first book.

00:31:21.338 --> 00:31:25.134
Also, we will see that a
running thread through these

00:31:25.134 --> 00:31:28.710
episodes is doubling,
the appearance of doubles of

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:32.140
Don Quixote, of reflections of
Don Quixote.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:36.112
The first is the episode that
is called, in Jarvis,

00:31:36.112 --> 00:31:40.880
"The Episode of the Knight
of the Looking-Glasses,"

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.250
which makes it very awkward for
me to say because,

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:47.160
of course, this is eighteenth
century English,

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.710
and the English say
looking-glass for a mirror,

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.307
and I say Knight of the
Looking-Glasses just to be

00:31:55.307 --> 00:31:59.788
consistent with the translation
that you are reading this time

00:31:59.788 --> 00:32:01.573
around,
but it's in Spanish

00:32:01.573 --> 00:32:03.618
"Caballero de los
espejos,"

00:32:03.618 --> 00:32:05.380
"Knight of the
Mirrors."

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:09.858
Now, this episode brings to
mind that of the fight of Don

00:32:09.858 --> 00:32:14.900
Quixote with the Basque in Part
I, because you do have an actual

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.618
dual.
 

00:32:15.618 --> 00:32:21.847
The most significant aspect of
this episode is that in it,

00:32:21.847 --> 00:32:28.077
Don Quixote meets his mirror
image and defeats that mirror

00:32:28.077 --> 00:32:29.170
image.
 

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:33.906
Carrasco has decided that the
only way to subject Don Quixote

00:32:33.906 --> 00:32:37.538
is to meet him at his own level
but mostly,

00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:42.150
what he is doing is reenacting
Part I in the way that Don

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.720
Quixote reenacted--
and still reenacts--the

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.480
romances of chivalry.
 

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.847
Don Quixote will fight a copy
of himself modeled after his own

00:32:51.847 --> 00:32:54.569
mad inventions,
a copy that is reach in

00:32:54.569 --> 00:32:55.430
details.
 

00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:00.660
Notice that Dulcinea here is
Casildea de Vandalia.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:05.528
Vandalia means Andalusia,
land of Vandals;

00:33:05.528 --> 00:33:11.248
the Vandals were one of the
Germanic tribes that invaded the

00:33:11.248 --> 00:33:16.093
peninsula after the collapse,
or with the collapse,

00:33:16.093 --> 00:33:18.420
of the Roman Empire.
 

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:23.502
Carrasco's get up as a
knight-errant is quite

00:33:23.502 --> 00:33:24.890
something.
 

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:31.278
He has outdone Don Quixote and
here is a quote from page 554:

00:33:31.278 --> 00:33:35.400
"Don Quixote viewed his
antagonist,

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.470
and found he had his helmet on,
and the beaver down,

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.769
so that he could not see his
face: but he observed him to be

00:33:43.769 --> 00:33:47.098
a strong-made man,
and not very tall.

00:33:47.098 --> 00:33:50.338
Over his armor he wore a kind
of surtout,

00:33:50.338 --> 00:33:55.048
or loose coat,
seemingly of the finest gold,

00:33:55.048 --> 00:33:58.384
besprinkled with sundry little
moons of resplendent

00:33:58.384 --> 00:34:01.582
looking-glass,
which made a most gallant and

00:34:01.582 --> 00:34:02.650
splendid show.
 

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:06.161
A great number of green,
yellow, and white feathers

00:34:06.161 --> 00:34:08.197
waved about his helmet."
 

00:34:08.197 --> 00:34:08.969
Unquote.
 

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:14.596
This translation or the
translation struggles a bit with

00:34:14.596 --> 00:34:20.427
the "lunas,"
the word used for mirrors in

00:34:20.427 --> 00:34:27.246
the original,
"muchas lunas de

00:34:27.246 --> 00:34:34.298
resplandecientes
espejos,"

00:34:34.298 --> 00:34:41.250
which contains,
that word, a most important

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.260
suggestion in the passage.
 

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:46.880
La "luna del
espejo"

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.719
is the reflecting part of the
mirror.

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:55.704
But "luna"
means "moon,"

00:34:55.704 --> 00:35:01.690
of course, and moon leads to
lunacy, to madness.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:04.150
Sansón is the Knight of
the Moons,

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.699
the Knight of Lunacy,
the Knight of Madness,

00:35:07.699 --> 00:35:11.295
which is quite appropriate
because in trying to cure Don

00:35:11.295 --> 00:35:14.911
Quixote's madness,
he is acting like a madman,

00:35:14.911 --> 00:35:16.239
like a lunatic.
 

00:35:16.239 --> 00:35:19.882
The moon, of course,
is also the celestial body of

00:35:19.882 --> 00:35:24.304
reflected light par excellence,
the same as the Knight of the

00:35:24.304 --> 00:35:28.219
Looking-Glasses,
Sansón in this get up,

00:35:28.219 --> 00:35:29.949
is a reflection of Don Quixote.
 

00:35:29.949 --> 00:35:33.094
If Don Quixote came close
enough to Sansón,

00:35:33.094 --> 00:35:37.329
he would be able to see himself
reflected on the little mirrors.

00:35:37.329 --> 00:35:40.896
As in the episode of the
parliament of death,

00:35:40.896 --> 00:35:45.518
Don Quixote has met a mirror
image of his madness here.

00:35:45.518 --> 00:35:49.630
It is more than just a
reflection, that is,

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.791
he is reflected in the Knight
of the Moons who is acting like

00:35:52.791 --> 00:35:54.764
him,
and he is also reflected in his

00:35:54.764 --> 00:35:57.240
armor,
being reflected back from those

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.380
little mirrors on his costume,
so you can see.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:08.041
Sancho has also met his double
in Tomé

00:36:08.041 --> 00:36:11.016
Cecial,
whose false nose is a

00:36:11.016 --> 00:36:14.070
prodigious example of the
grotesque,

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:19.230
which is such a prevalent
quality in Part II.

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.557
I quote: "...
 

00:36:20.557 --> 00:36:25.132
scarcely have the clearness of
the day given opportunity to see

00:36:25.132 --> 00:36:28.552
and distinguish objects,
when the first thing that

00:36:28.552 --> 00:36:30.500
presented itself to Sancho's
eyes,

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:34.590
was the Squire of the Wood's
nose, which was so large,

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:37.309
that it almost overshadowed his
whole body.

00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:40.849
In a word, it is said to have
been of an excessive size,

00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:43.355
hawked in the middle,
and full of warts and

00:36:43.355 --> 00:36:46.050
carbuncles,
of the color of a mulberry,

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:49.500
and hanging two fingers'
breadth below his mouth.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.300
The size, the color,
the carbuncles,

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.510
and the crookedness,
so disfigured his face,

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:59.529
that Sancho,
at sight thereof,

00:36:59.529 --> 00:37:04.641
began to tremble hand and foot,
like a child in a fit,

00:37:04.641 --> 00:37:08.858
and resolved within himself to
take two hundred cuffs before

00:37:08.858 --> 00:37:13.289
his choler should awaken to
encounter that hobgoblin."

00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:18.985
He may have thought that he had
to fight this fellow as the two

00:37:18.985 --> 00:37:22.659
masters would fight and he is
saying,

00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:26.168
after seeing that nose,
I would never,

00:37:26.168 --> 00:37:28.730
never fight this monster.
 

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.516
Notice the exaggerated
dimensions and utter hideousness

00:37:31.516 --> 00:37:34.610
of the nose, which together with
its being artificial and new

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:35.849
features of Part II.
 

00:37:35.849 --> 00:37:39.762
Maritornes was naturally ugly,
and though her physical

00:37:39.762 --> 00:37:43.804
deformities were extreme,
they are at least her own,

00:37:43.804 --> 00:37:47.829
and not likely to inspire fear
so much as repulsion.

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:53.168
But here Sancho is moved to
dread, which will happen often

00:37:53.168 --> 00:37:58.884
in Part II: fear is one of the
emotions that we encounter once

00:37:58.884 --> 00:38:02.954
and again in Part II,
and you can begin charting them

00:38:02.954 --> 00:38:03.639
from now on.
 

00:38:03.639 --> 00:38:07.860
Tomé Cecial's nose is
connected to the aesthetics of

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.789
the Baroque whose emblematic
figure is the monster,

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:16.070
a figure made up of disparate
conflicting elements,

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.898
like the nose,
and contrived to cause

00:38:18.898 --> 00:38:19.920
admiration.
 

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.643
The monster is made to be
shown, and this quality is

00:38:23.643 --> 00:38:28.168
embedded in the very etymology
of the word "monster,"

00:38:28.168 --> 00:38:31.599
"monstrare,"
in the Latin.

00:38:31.599 --> 00:38:35.989
Don Quixote has met in the
Knight of the Looking-Glasses an

00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:38.766
image of his madness;
in Tomé

00:38:38.766 --> 00:38:42.619
Cecial, Sancho has met an image
of his foolishness.

00:38:42.619 --> 00:38:46.668
Tomé is like a carnival
figure of the fool and his

00:38:46.668 --> 00:38:51.005
costume is reminiscent of those
of the actors in the wagon of

00:38:51.005 --> 00:38:53.030
the parliament of death.
 

00:38:53.030 --> 00:39:04.099
His name is a pun:
Tomé Cecial,

00:39:04.099 --> 00:39:08.755
"Tomé,"
of course, is a form of

00:39:08.755 --> 00:39:11.909
Tomás,
Thomas;

00:39:11.909 --> 00:39:16.496
but Cecial, at the time,
meant a kind of

00:39:16.496 --> 00:39:18.849
"trout."
 

00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:20.840
So "tomé,"
being the past,

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.407
his name means "I ate
trout" if you step back and

00:39:25.407 --> 00:39:26.510
think of it.
 

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:30.313
There are many names that mean
something and you don't catch on

00:39:30.313 --> 00:39:33.088
to it until you think about it,
but this is,

00:39:33.088 --> 00:39:35.730
scholars have come up with
identifying that,

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:42.010
Tomé Cecial, I ate trout.
 

00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:46.115
Now, the fact that Tomé
is an image of Sancho's

00:39:46.115 --> 00:39:49.525
foolishness is so much so
because Tomé

00:39:49.525 --> 00:39:54.074
is Sancho's neighbor,
his equal, with whom Sancho

00:39:54.074 --> 00:39:59.708
discourses on things proper to
squires and whose gluttony and

00:39:59.708 --> 00:40:02.150
other habits he shares.
 

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:05.597
The dialogue about the
contingency of meaning and

00:40:05.597 --> 00:40:09.235
language,
centering on "hijo de

00:40:09.235 --> 00:40:13.063
puta"
or "whore's son"

00:40:13.063 --> 00:40:15.967
is hilarious,
but bespeaks of a very modern

00:40:15.967 --> 00:40:18.875
conception of language,
as Spitzer mentions somewhere

00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:22.034
in his essay,
that is meaning is contingent

00:40:22.034 --> 00:40:24.322
in language,
it is not fixed,

00:40:24.322 --> 00:40:27.657
it is shifty,
and this is consistent with the

00:40:27.657 --> 00:40:31.132
view of the Middle Ages,
Renaissance and Baroque--in the

00:40:31.132 --> 00:40:33.750
Baroque is shiftiness,
as language is emphasized.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:41.659
So in the dialogue of the
squires there is also a critique

00:40:41.659 --> 00:40:47.157
of the upper classes,
a frequent topic in Part II,

00:40:47.157 --> 00:40:50.409
that you might also chart as
you read it.

00:40:50.409 --> 00:40:55.786
They, particularly Sancho,
do not accept the codes of

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:59.510
chivalry that lead to such
fights.

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:05.085
Sancho seems to be saying that
it is the upper classes that

00:41:05.085 --> 00:41:08.449
start wars, a very deep
critique.

00:41:08.449 --> 00:41:14.440
This is part of the political
element of the second book,

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:18.503
of the 1615 Quixote,
but also fits in within

00:41:18.503 --> 00:41:22.079
thematics of the
desengaño,

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:25.920
because the accoutrements of
the upper classes,

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:29.103
their luxuries,
are part of the deceits that

00:41:29.103 --> 00:41:32.139
are undone by
desengaño,

00:41:32.139 --> 00:41:36.949
as you will see as you move
through the upper classes in the

00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:38.579
next few episodes.
 

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:43.599
Now, what is the significance
of all of this doubling?

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:46.710
Don Quixote meets a double,
Sancho meets a double,

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:51.418
I think that at the deepest
level it means that the

00:41:51.418 --> 00:41:56.704
characters have met themselves,
and struggled each within

00:41:56.704 --> 00:41:59.960
himself to find meaning and
identity,

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:07.952
or identity within meaning,
or a form of wise self

00:42:07.952 --> 00:42:13.250
recognition,
troubled self recognition.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.581
This is tied to the issue of
self-reflexivity that we have

00:42:17.581 --> 00:42:20.469
been discussing since the
beginning.

00:42:20.469 --> 00:42:24.469
If the Renaissance mind,
the mind of the Renaissance,

00:42:24.469 --> 00:42:28.547
if I my use an abstraction,
sallies forth in search of the

00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:32.483
real world,
which it tries to interpret,

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:35.851
control and use,
the Baroque mind,

00:42:35.851 --> 00:42:40.697
in that sallying forth,
finds mostly itself,

00:42:40.697 --> 00:42:45.099
it finds its own inner
workings.

00:42:45.099 --> 00:42:49.030
This is equate to Descartes,
"Je pense,

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:51.463
donc je suis,"
"Cogito ergo

00:42:51.463 --> 00:42:53.670
sum,"
"I think therefore I

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:56.784
am," which is the ultimate
truth that Descartes can

00:42:56.784 --> 00:43:01.398
findâ€“Descartes,
1596-1650 roughly contemporary

00:43:01.398 --> 00:43:08.217
a little later than Cervantes--
but it is a self recognizable

00:43:08.217 --> 00:43:15.166
yet disfigured in these images,
in need of further and further

00:43:15.166 --> 00:43:21.184
thought and reflection with the
emphasis on reflection on like a

00:43:21.184 --> 00:43:22.139
mirror.
 

00:43:22.139 --> 00:43:24.659
It is appropriate,
then, for these reasons,

00:43:24.659 --> 00:43:28.851
that the characters should meet
distorted images of their own

00:43:28.851 --> 00:43:31.891
selves,
or twisted reflections of

00:43:31.891 --> 00:43:34.889
themselves in their adventures.
 

00:43:34.889 --> 00:43:39.090
Sansón Carrasco has
fallen into his own trap while

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:43.440
Don Quixote and Sancho have an
almost literally out of body

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:47.639
experience seeing themselves
outside of themselves,

00:43:47.639 --> 00:43:53.280
and seeing themselves how they
would look to others.

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.139
This is particularly troubling
to,

00:43:56.139 --> 00:43:59.119
I think, Sancho,
but also to Don Quixote who,

00:43:59.119 --> 00:44:06.335
as the novel progresses,
will find more such instances

00:44:06.335 --> 00:44:13.550
where reflections of this kind
undermine his quest.

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:17.561
Saying so, we move on to the
episode of the lions,

00:44:17.561 --> 00:44:22.639
which is reminiscent of that of
the galley slaves in Part I.

00:44:22.639 --> 00:44:25.992
The lions, like the prisoners,
are prisoners,

00:44:25.992 --> 00:44:29.813
and they belong to the king;
they are also under the

00:44:29.813 --> 00:44:31.550
supervision of the crown.
 

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.809
Finding lions in the middle of
Castile is not a common

00:44:34.809 --> 00:44:37.873
occurrence,
so their appearance is another

00:44:37.873 --> 00:44:42.425
instance of the real conspiring
to add to Don Quixote's madness

00:44:42.425 --> 00:44:46.831
by presenting him with beings
and objects that are out of the

00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:47.860
ordinary.
 

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:52.097
Like the players in the cart,
lions are objects of

00:44:52.097 --> 00:44:54.657
amusements,
they are being taken to courts

00:44:54.657 --> 00:44:56.230
so they can viewed by the
people,

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.170
amusement and display.
 

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:03.454
They are fit for heroic action,
and Don Quixote does act with

00:45:03.454 --> 00:45:06.809
great courage only to be mocked
by the lion,

00:45:06.809 --> 00:45:11.751
that not only acts peacefully
but turns his hindquarters to

00:45:11.751 --> 00:45:14.331
the knight;
the ultimate insult:

00:45:14.331 --> 00:45:18.530
heroism is no longer possible
under these circumstances.

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:23.190
It is a very cruel episode for
Don Quixote,

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.447
but together with the fight
with the Knight of the

00:45:26.447 --> 00:45:29.766
Looking-Glasses,
these are two victories for Don

00:45:29.766 --> 00:45:31.829
Quixote,
which together with the

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:35.811
knowledge that is now in a book,
add to his diluted sense of

00:45:35.811 --> 00:45:38.289
importance and of
accomplishments.

00:45:38.289 --> 00:45:41.490
The characters around him
conspire to increase this

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:45.141
delusion, but the lions are real
and could have killed Don

00:45:45.141 --> 00:45:46.869
Quixote and the others.
 

00:45:46.869 --> 00:45:49.264
Jorge Luis Borges,
whom I have quoted so many

00:45:49.264 --> 00:45:53.010
times in this course,
the great Argentine writer,

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:57.713
says that courage is the one
characteristic that is a

00:45:57.713 --> 00:46:01.150
constant from book one to book
two;

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:05.786
the courage of Don Quixote,
and it is also the constant

00:46:05.786 --> 00:46:10.253
from Alonso Quijano to Don
Quijote and back to Alonso

00:46:10.253 --> 00:46:13.260
Quijano at the end of the book.
 

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:19.329
And so we come to the gentleman
in green, the gentleman in the

00:46:19.329 --> 00:46:21.320
Green Riding-coat.
 

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:25.146
In Don Diego de Miranda,
Don Quixote meets another

00:46:25.146 --> 00:46:29.130
double, but an inverted one,
like a mirror image.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:34.103
Don Diego de Miranda appears to
be the hidalgo Don Quixote would

00:46:34.103 --> 00:46:38.050
have been had he not read
romances of chivalry,

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:42.032
turned mad, and chosen to
attempt to revive the age of

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:42.860
chivalry.
 

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.746
He is like the Knight of the
Looking-Glasses,

00:46:45.746 --> 00:46:49.157
another distorted reflection of
Don Quixote, the one,

00:46:49.157 --> 00:46:51.650
I repeat, that he could have
been.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:55.027
Don Diego is the image of what
the French, in the period,

00:46:55.027 --> 00:46:57.440
called the honnête
homme.

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.432
He is reasonably well off,
reads devotional books,

00:47:01.432 --> 00:47:05.590
hunts, and lives an honest
peaceful life at home.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:09.646
Don Quixote mocks him,
slightly in the episode of the

00:47:09.646 --> 00:47:12.605
lions,
when Don Diego prudently runs

00:47:12.605 --> 00:47:15.304
away,
and again, as he takes his

00:47:15.304 --> 00:47:18.289
leave, telling him that he is
not--

00:47:18.289 --> 00:47:20.820
Don Quixote says he is not
giving to leisure,

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.690
like Don Diego.
 

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:26.626
Don Diego is a kind of
pre-bourgeois character,

00:47:26.626 --> 00:47:31.849
but he has a son who wants to
be a poet Lorenzo de Miranda.

00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:35.530
We have, once again,
the post-prandial conversation,

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:38.922
and one more time,
the discussion centers in the

00:47:38.922 --> 00:47:41.809
relative merits of arms and
letters.

00:47:41.809 --> 00:47:45.750
This is a repetition of that
episode,

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:50.059
but now in a well appointed
house not in a dilapidated inn,

00:47:50.059 --> 00:47:53.342
and Don Quixote has
interlocutors who are on his

00:47:53.342 --> 00:47:54.809
intellectual level.
 

00:47:54.809 --> 00:47:57.985
Lorenzo is quite a good poet,
who reminds us of

00:47:57.985 --> 00:48:01.992
Grisóstomo and Cardenio,
but does not take action as

00:48:01.992 --> 00:48:02.889
they did.
 

00:48:02.889 --> 00:48:07.210
Don Quixote reveals that he
knows a great deal about poetry,

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.838
but the outcome of the exchange
is that chivalry surpasses

00:48:11.838 --> 00:48:14.480
poetry,
that arms are superior to

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:15.139
letters.
 

00:48:15.139 --> 00:48:20.903
This whole section seems to be
in homage of Garcilaso de la

00:48:20.903 --> 00:48:23.894
Vega,
the great Spanish poet of the

00:48:23.894 --> 00:48:26.893
sixteenth century,
whose name I've mentioned many

00:48:26.893 --> 00:48:29.313
times,
and who has become by this time

00:48:29.313 --> 00:48:32.559
the model of poet,
courtier and soldier.

00:48:32.559 --> 00:48:37.041
Garcilaso, who lived in the
first half of the sixteenth

00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:41.856
century died while attempting to
scale the wall of a castle

00:48:41.856 --> 00:48:45.840
during a battle in Charles the
Fifth's army;

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.849
they dropped a rock on him.
 

00:48:47.849 --> 00:48:53.286
He only lived thirty-six years,
but his poetry changed the

00:48:53.286 --> 00:48:56.909
course of poetry in Spanish
forever.

00:48:56.909 --> 00:49:00.090
Cervantes was quite devoted to
him.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:04.012
The discussion turns to the
issue of if a poet can be made

00:49:04.012 --> 00:49:07.043
or if he is born,
and this, again,

00:49:07.043 --> 00:49:12.829
is another example of Don
Quixote's extensive readings of

00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:16.860
other than merely books of
chivalry.

00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:22.204
This is the library beyond the
library that was burnt by the

00:49:22.204 --> 00:49:27.730
priest and the barber and the
women at Don Quixote's house.

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:32.130
And then we come to the last
episode I'll be discussing

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:37.018
today, which is a transition
episode to Camacho's wedding.

00:49:37.018 --> 00:49:40.074
This is the episode of the
swordsmen, the two swordsmen who

00:49:40.074 --> 00:49:41.969
begin to argue about who's
better.

00:49:41.969 --> 00:49:44.092
One is very,
very strong,

00:49:44.092 --> 00:49:49.400
and the other is one is an
expert, a scientist of fencing.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.409
At this time,
since the advent of firearms

00:49:52.409 --> 00:49:55.565
and all of that,
fencing had become a sport,

00:49:55.565 --> 00:49:58.429
and not only a sport but a
science.

00:49:58.429 --> 00:50:03.704
There were books written about,
trying to understand fencing in

00:50:03.704 --> 00:50:08.382
geometric and mathematical
terms, and Cervantes liked to

00:50:08.382 --> 00:50:10.170
poke fun at this.
 

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:15.920
However, it is the scientific
swordsman who makes a fool out

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:19.253
of the other one,
who is so strong that,

00:50:19.253 --> 00:50:22.715
at the end, when he is very
angry he takes his sword and

00:50:22.715 --> 00:50:26.302
throws it so far away that it
takes a long time to get out

00:50:26.302 --> 00:50:27.940
there and pick it up.
 

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:35.771
The point of this throwaway
episode in the scene is that it

00:50:35.771 --> 00:50:41.039
shows that art triumphs over
nature,

00:50:41.039 --> 00:50:44.739
that science triumphs over
strength,

00:50:44.739 --> 00:50:52.086
and the triumph of art over
nature is a baroque topic that

00:50:52.086 --> 00:50:57.760
appears once and again
throughout Part II.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.670
And we are going to be talking
about that in the next class,

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:05.289
when we talk about Camacho's
wedding in relation to a

00:51:05.289 --> 00:51:09.119
painting by Velázquez
called The Spinners,

00:51:09.119 --> 00:51:10.929
Las hilanderas.
 

00:51:10.929 --> 00:51:17.688
But now we have to turn and to
conclude to our Exemplary

00:51:17.688 --> 00:51:21.884
Story, The Glass
Graduate,

00:51:21.884 --> 00:51:26.079
which I hope that you have
read.

00:51:26.079 --> 00:51:31.429
We have gone over the 1613
Exemplary Stories book,

00:51:31.429 --> 00:51:34.447
how Cervantes published it,
because publishers became

00:51:34.447 --> 00:51:37.407
interested in his work after the
success of the 1605

00:51:37.407 --> 00:51:38.510
Quixote.
 

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.119
Also, once he realized that he
couldn't use these stories,

00:51:42.119 --> 00:51:45.471
which he had in the way he used
them in Part I because he had

00:51:45.471 --> 00:51:48.063
been so criticized--
and you have read about the

00:51:48.063 --> 00:51:50.889
criticisms as they appear at the
beginning of Part II,

00:51:50.889 --> 00:51:53.983
so Cervantes,
who prided himself on being the

00:51:53.983 --> 00:51:58.413
first to ever write this kind of
novella in the Spanish language

00:51:58.413 --> 00:52:02.490
collected them in this wonderful
book that would have given

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:06.568
Cervantes a prominent place in
the canon even if he had not

00:52:06.568 --> 00:52:09.030
written the Quixote.
 

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.382
Now, The Glass Graduate
is one of the better known

00:52:12.382 --> 00:52:15.673
stories famous for the very
strange kind of madness that

00:52:15.673 --> 00:52:17.409
afflicts the protagonist.
 

00:52:17.409 --> 00:52:21.599
He believes himself to be made
of glass, and lives in constant

00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:23.179
fear of being broken.
 

00:52:23.179 --> 00:52:27.101
It is another example of
Cervantes' profound interest in

00:52:27.101 --> 00:52:30.951
the workings of the human mind
and in issues concerning

00:52:30.951 --> 00:52:34.730
knowledge and the ability to
arrive at the truth.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:39.630
Tomás is a very
suggestive sort of paranoia,

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:44.630
it is an illness that has a
kafkaesque air to it.

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:47.394
In Kafka's The
Metamorphosis,

00:52:47.394 --> 00:52:50.318
as you know,
the protagonist becomes a

00:52:50.318 --> 00:52:53.864
roach;
Tomás suffers a malaise

00:52:53.864 --> 00:52:58.182
that is experienced through fear
of bodily harm,

00:52:58.182 --> 00:53:00.480
of physical fragility.
 

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:04.525
It is a way of feeling
different and vulnerable that

00:53:04.525 --> 00:53:08.016
can be extended to a general
human condition,

00:53:08.016 --> 00:53:10.000
a form of alienation.
 

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.099
I think this is the main reason
why the story is so compelling,

00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:18.963
the idea of this madness,
that you feel yourself made of

00:53:18.963 --> 00:53:21.356
glass,
and therefore vulnerable,

00:53:21.356 --> 00:53:24.806
and you try to establish a
distance between you and the

00:53:24.806 --> 00:53:27.657
others,
who might break you or

00:53:27.657 --> 00:53:32.539
anything, a tile falling a roof
might break you,

00:53:32.539 --> 00:53:42.577
and taking laborious measures
to protect your very vulnerable

00:53:42.577 --> 00:53:43.750
body.
 

00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:48.012
Now, the novel begins as if it
were to be a compressed kind of

00:53:48.012 --> 00:53:51.963
a bildungsroman--
that's a German word for novel

00:53:51.963 --> 00:53:53.798
of education,
"bildung"

00:53:53.798 --> 00:53:55.190
education, "bildung
sroman"--

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:59.411
but then it moves on to
encompass Tomás's entire

00:53:59.411 --> 00:53:59.960
life.
 

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.070
It is not, however,
a biography,

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:05.476
but it centers on two or three
periods of his life,

00:54:05.476 --> 00:54:09.018
most particularly on the one
during his illness.

00:54:09.018 --> 00:54:12.867
The plot is circular,
and circularity is expressed

00:54:12.867 --> 00:54:16.010
through Tomás's very last
name.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:18.920
First he is called
"Rodaja,"

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.675
his last name is
"Rodaja,"

00:54:21.675 --> 00:54:26.318
which means "slice,"
"una rodaja"

00:54:26.318 --> 00:54:30.489
is "a slice,"
or not quite a circle,

00:54:30.489 --> 00:54:34.619
a fragment of a sphere,
but when he--

00:54:34.619 --> 00:54:37.773
at the end--when he recovers
from his illness and is in full

00:54:37.773 --> 00:54:41.132
command of his faculties,
his last name becomes

00:54:41.132 --> 00:54:46.099
"Rueda"
which means "wheel."

00:54:46.099 --> 00:54:48.260
so he has been completed.
 

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.300
We go back to Spitzer and his
polynomasia.

00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:55.530
 
 

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:58.677
Now, during his illness,
he is known as the

00:54:58.677 --> 00:55:03.250
"Licenciado Vidriera"
which is the name of the story

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:06.101
in Spanish,
which means "the

00:55:06.101 --> 00:55:08.539
Licentiate Glass Window."
 

00:55:08.539 --> 00:55:10.630
They call him "graduate
glass" in the translation,

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:12.074
but "vidriera"
means a "glass

00:55:12.074 --> 00:55:13.230
window,"
a stained glass window,

00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:15.170
or a glass display case.
 

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:20.003
So this is what his name is;
again, we have to go back to

00:55:20.003 --> 00:55:23.690
Spitzer and names,
and things, and so forth.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:26.909
There is something passive
about Tomás,

00:55:26.909 --> 00:55:29.701
except when he is ill,
but on the whole,

00:55:29.701 --> 00:55:31.489
things happen to him.
 

00:55:31.489 --> 00:55:34.474
He is found lying down under
some trees by the young

00:55:34.474 --> 00:55:36.699
gentlemen who take him to
Salamanca;

00:55:36.699 --> 00:55:40.690
he is their servant for eight
years,

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:43.916
but also acquires an education
showing a remarkable

00:55:43.916 --> 00:55:47.344
intelligence,
though this is only reported,

00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:50.119
not dramatized,
until he's ill;

00:55:50.119 --> 00:55:53.030
he is always in a second plane
as it were.

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:55.789
As a soldier,
he moves around trying to soak

00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:58.869
up as much experience and
culture as possible.

00:55:58.869 --> 00:56:02.746
Tomás is then
administered a poison by a

00:56:02.746 --> 00:56:06.239
spurned woman,
a spurned woman who is no

00:56:06.239 --> 00:56:09.434
courtly damsel,
but a notorious whore,

00:56:09.434 --> 00:56:11.719
who falls in love with him.
 

00:56:11.719 --> 00:56:16.085
The poison quince preserve,
"membrillo,"

00:56:16.085 --> 00:56:19.143
that she gives him,
is redolent with sexual

00:56:19.143 --> 00:56:21.195
connotations,
as in Latin,

00:56:21.195 --> 00:56:23.054
in the classics,
the

00:56:23.054 --> 00:56:28.342
"membrillo,"
in the original Latin was

00:56:28.342 --> 00:56:34.610
associated by way of resemblance
with female sexual organs.

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:38.090
This is how she lures him into
eating it,

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:42.590
but there is no hint of what
makes him attractive to her,

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:44.619
other than perhaps his fame as
a brilliant scholar.

00:56:44.619 --> 00:56:47.036
It seems like a whim,
that she falls in love with

00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:47.340
him.
 

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.719
She disappears,
and that is far as the erotic

00:56:49.719 --> 00:56:51.989
themes goes in the story:
it disappears.

00:56:51.989 --> 00:56:55.920
When ill, Tomás displays
a remarkable intelligence and

00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:58.380
wit,
being not only insightful in

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:01.835
his observations,
but making these with puns,

00:57:01.835 --> 00:57:05.329
sharp witticisms and clever
circumlocutions.

00:57:05.329 --> 00:57:08.519
He is oracular,
he is like an Oracle and is

00:57:08.519 --> 00:57:10.800
consulted as such by people.
 

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:15.396
There is a correlation between
his illness and his

00:57:15.396 --> 00:57:18.960
insightfulness,
which seems to hinge on

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:24.869
transparency since he believes
himself to be made of glass.

00:57:24.869 --> 00:57:30.202
And if you go to page one
thirteen you will find a quote

00:57:30.202 --> 00:57:36.018
in which he challenges them to
ask him questions that he will

00:57:36.018 --> 00:57:40.411
be able to answer,
but, because he was a man of

00:57:40.411 --> 00:57:43.315
glass rather than flesh,
I'm quoting:

00:57:43.315 --> 00:57:47.641
"For since glass was a
fine and delicate substance his

00:57:47.641 --> 00:57:52.119
mind would function more quickly
and efficiently in that in a

00:57:52.119 --> 00:57:56.222
conventional body which was made
of denser and earthlier

00:57:56.222 --> 00:57:57.639
stuff."
 

00:57:57.639 --> 00:58:00.936
I mean, his body would be
denser, and glass is transparent

00:58:00.936 --> 00:58:03.019
and so forth--this is in page
113.

00:58:03.019 --> 00:58:07.789
 
 

00:58:07.789 --> 00:58:10.206
In other words,
Tomás's mind makes

00:58:10.206 --> 00:58:13.347
transparent the world around
him, just as his body is

00:58:13.347 --> 00:58:16.766
presumably transparent;
transparency gives him access

00:58:16.766 --> 00:58:17.630
to the truth.
 

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:21.260
But he is also said to be
highly educated and intelligent,

00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:25.119
so his insightfulness,
once he is ill,

00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:27.409
is like an increase of these
qualities,

00:58:27.409 --> 00:58:30.409
or is it disconnected from it?
 

00:58:30.409 --> 00:58:34.594
It is not clear if it was the
poison or the precarious

00:58:34.594 --> 00:58:39.409
condition in which he believes
to be that sharpens his wit.

00:58:39.409 --> 00:58:43.000
He is like the black man in the
traditional story,

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.001
who can tell the emperor that
he is naked because he has

00:58:46.001 --> 00:58:48.943
nothing to lose,
because Tomás,

00:58:48.943 --> 00:58:53.329
because of his illness,
has become a sort of freak;

00:58:53.329 --> 00:58:56.554
he has no reputation to
protect, and so he pierces

00:58:56.554 --> 00:59:00.570
through all social convention,
and through hypocrisy and lies,

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.150
and tells the truth.
 

00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:10.206
He also, in outlining the
various virtues and defects of

00:59:10.206 --> 00:59:15.913
each profession or trade,
is following a traditional

00:59:15.913 --> 00:59:19.880
formula,
a set piece that became a skit

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.221
in the theater,
too, someone who tells,

00:59:23.221 --> 00:59:26.019
well, monks do this,
and cobblers do that;

00:59:26.019 --> 00:59:28.579
that is behind this story.
 

00:59:28.579 --> 00:59:32.360
Now, The Glass Graduate
has much in common with the

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.762
Quixote and seems to
dramatize the common debate in

00:59:35.762 --> 00:59:39.164
that book between arms and
letters because he is both a

00:59:39.164 --> 00:59:42.822
soldier and he is a student,
a brilliant student at

00:59:42.822 --> 00:59:44.539
Salamanca, a law student.
 

00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:48.730
But whereas Don Quixote is
mainly a reader of literature,

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:52.878
of romances of chivalry above
all, Tomás is a legal

00:59:52.878 --> 00:59:56.088
scholar,
whose mission is reaching the

00:59:56.088 --> 00:59:56.670
truth.
 

00:59:56.670 --> 01:00:00.023
His quest is more intellectual
than literary,

01:00:00.023 --> 01:00:03.226
so, in that sense,
he is not quite like Don

01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:07.266
Quixote, he is different,
more philosophical one could

01:00:07.266 --> 01:00:08.030
say.
 

01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:12.896
The ending seems to suggest,
as it is throughout the

01:00:12.896 --> 01:00:16.445
Quixote,
the preeminence of arms over

01:00:16.445 --> 01:00:21.148
letters when he has to escape
from Salamanca and goes back to

01:00:21.148 --> 01:00:25.382
Flanders and has a career in the
army and ends his life

01:00:25.382 --> 01:00:26.559
honorably.
 

01:00:26.559 --> 01:00:30.472
Now, we will be looking at
other Exemplary Stories

01:00:30.472 --> 01:00:33.695
in the near future,
and you will be able to

01:00:33.695 --> 01:00:38.166
experience the variety of plots
and narrative experiments that

01:00:38.166 --> 01:00:42.081
the book contains and that,
I think, is the reason for its

01:00:42.081 --> 01:00:44.195
being--
for these stories--being called

01:00:44.195 --> 01:00:47.559
exemplary;
they are like a collection of

01:00:47.559 --> 01:00:51.570
samples or examples of plots and
stories.

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:57.000

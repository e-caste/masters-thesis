00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.010
Professor Donald
Kagan: Welcome back!

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.863
I wanted to let you realize
that the Peloponnesian War is

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:11.632
over.
What a relief,

00:00:11.632 --> 00:00:15.948
twenty-seven bitter years,
but it's just one of those

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:20.846
times through history that you
discover no sooner is it over

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:24.250
than another kind of trouble
starts.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.435
Of course, as you know,
the whole course has been

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:29.213
filled with that kind of trouble
and it will continue that way

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:32.983
right to the end.
Well, you remember what the

00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:38.820
Spartans allegedly went to war
about back there in 431.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.392
They were going to free the
Greeks, and the irony of that is

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:48.188
really quite extraordinary.
Remember Xenophon ends his tale

00:00:48.188 --> 00:00:53.284
of the end of the Peloponnesian
War, how the Spartans and their

00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:58.462
people were all tearing down the
walls of Athens to the music of

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:01.750
flute girls and everybody
thinking,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.420
or it seemed,
I forget exactly how he puts it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.842
that this represented the
beginning of freedom for the

00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:11.766
Greeks.
Well of course,

00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.838
he was writing these years
later and he knew perfectly well

00:01:14.838 --> 00:01:18.106
that was an illusion,
because Spartan power,

00:01:18.106 --> 00:01:22.463
which had grown to an
unprecedented degree in the

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:27.643
course of the war,
now presented the Spartans with

00:01:27.643 --> 00:01:32.820
problems and opportunities.
I think that's a very important

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.330
thing to understand,
and I think not enough people

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.575
do.
Power has a certain life of its

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:42.515
own.
The capacity to be able to do

00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:47.314
something without somebody
preventing you makes you think

00:01:47.314 --> 00:01:52.371
about what you might do in ways
that you never thought about

00:01:52.371 --> 00:01:55.689
before,
when you didn't have the power

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.420
to do it, and of course this is
what happens to the Spartans.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.469
They find themselves presented
with choices that they could

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.418
take.
How were they to conduct

00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:15.057
themselves and their state and
how were they to try to arrange

00:02:15.057 --> 00:02:19.310
the structure of states in the
Greek world,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.948
and including their relations
to Persia, because they really

00:02:22.948 --> 00:02:26.648
had enough power to be able to
think of different things they

00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:30.277
might do.
The logic of the situation

00:02:30.277 --> 00:02:33.860
presented really three
possibilities.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.699
They could, of course,
do what they had done much of

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.410
the time before the fifth
century,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.985
mainly to confine themselves to
the Peloponnesus,

00:02:42.985 --> 00:02:45.990
to maintain their control of
the Peloponnesian League,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.507
and basically not to get
involved in anything outside the

00:02:50.507 --> 00:02:54.380
Peloponnesus and much
recommended that in Spartan

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.257
tradition.
It meant that the helot

00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:01.436
problem, which was always on
their minds, something they

00:03:01.436 --> 00:03:04.616
couldn't forget,
they were desperately

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:09.331
outnumbered at all times by
people who hated them and whom

00:03:09.331 --> 00:03:13.682
they lived off.
So, the notion of leaving with

00:03:13.682 --> 00:03:18.738
an army from the Peloponnesus at
any time was always a

00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:23.090
questionable proposition,
even though sometimes it was

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.194
necessary.
As we shall see,

00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:29.023
changes had taken place in
Sparta in the course of the

00:03:29.023 --> 00:03:32.980
Peloponnesian War,
of which I suppose the most

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.583
important was the appearance in
the hands of Spartans of a good

00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:43.001
deal of money,
which was made available by the

00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:47.650
Persians for wartime purposes,
both in the doing,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.881
in the collecting of that money
and also in the taking of many

00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:54.271
cities away from the Athenians,
very prosperous cities the

00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:57.050
Spartans also gained a great
deal of booty.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.646
So, for the first time there
were lots of Spartans,

00:04:00.646 --> 00:04:03.379
who had lots of money and of
course,

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.384
as you know,
not only was that not a

00:04:05.384 --> 00:04:08.420
characteristic feature of
Spartan society normally,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.619
it was forbidden.
The laws in Sparta did not

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:15.097
permit coins.
The closest thing to coins were

00:04:15.097 --> 00:04:20.087
these fistfuls of iron spits
which don't get you very far and

00:04:20.087 --> 00:04:24.552
don't buy very much.
It was--see the point is that

00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:28.864
the presence of that kind of
wealth, and really no

00:04:28.864 --> 00:04:34.145
traditional way of coping with
it meant that there were other

00:04:34.145 --> 00:04:38.281
uncertainties now and
opportunities that various

00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:43.450
Spartans felt.
So, anyway the idea of staying

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.759
in the Peloponnesus certainly
appealed to many Spartans,

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.185
because they feared that
involvement outside the Spartan

00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:58.449
world and certainly they fear
the arrival of money,

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:02.535
which would be necessary as
they begin to be engaged outside

00:05:02.535 --> 00:05:06.274
that world, would undermine
those traditions which they

00:05:06.274 --> 00:05:09.135
valued so much,
which were part of their

00:05:09.135 --> 00:05:11.947
identity.
Living according to the laws of

00:05:11.947 --> 00:05:16.072
Lycurgus was what it meant to be
a Spartan and made you feel

00:05:16.072 --> 00:05:19.705
superior to other people.
So, there was a feeling of

00:05:19.705 --> 00:05:23.378
danger in the minds of the
conservative Spartans who would

00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:27.302
have preferred that.
But of course there was the

00:05:27.302 --> 00:05:31.163
other possibility that the
Spartans could use this

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:35.524
new-found power,
and I suppose the money that

00:05:35.524 --> 00:05:40.638
went with it to govern things,
and maybe to exploit

00:05:40.638 --> 00:05:46.060
opportunities outside the
Peloponnesus and that choice

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.050
also could be divided up into
two.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.421
At the extreme,
the Spartans had it in their

00:05:54.421 --> 00:06:01.029
power to contest control of the
entire Greek world in the east.

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:03.490
I mean, I'm leaving out,
as we always do,

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.319
western Greeks who live in
Italy and Sicily,

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.147
except when they get involved
in the main theatre in the

00:06:09.147 --> 00:06:13.165
Aegean.
But the Spartans could have and

00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:19.360
some Spartans did want to
contest control of the Aegean

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.074
and of the coast of Asia Minor,
and of the Hellespont and the

00:06:25.074 --> 00:06:27.076
waters beyond,
with the Persians,

00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:30.330
who would otherwise have
controlled them now that the

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:34.304
Athenians were out of the way.
This would require money

00:06:34.304 --> 00:06:37.617
but would also make money
available, and of course it

00:06:37.617 --> 00:06:41.250
would take power but it would
also produce more power.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.109
In a certain sense,
Spartans who took this point of

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:49.663
view had it in mind to take the
place of Athens as the great

00:06:49.663 --> 00:06:53.060
imperial power in the Aegean and
beyond.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.120
That was a possibility.
We know for sure that some

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.370
Spartans, and the chief figure
here was Lysander,

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.055
the Greek general,
admiral, who had been

00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:08.186
responsible for winning the war,
we know for sure that he and

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:12.318
others around him liked that
idea and sought to pursue it but

00:07:12.318 --> 00:07:15.209
they were not alone in that
opinion.

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:18.554
Then there's a third
possibility that the Spartans

00:07:18.554 --> 00:07:22.277
had, and although the ancient
sources don't tell us that any

00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:25.370
Spartan leader specifically had
this in mind,

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.822
the sheer logic of it suggests
that some of them must have

00:07:28.822 --> 00:07:32.643
thought this was a good idea,
and certainly some of the

00:07:32.643 --> 00:07:36.839
Spartan actions suggest that
they were pursuing such,

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:38.579
or tried to pursue such a
policy.

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:41.987
That was not to be confined to
the Peloponnesus,

00:07:41.987 --> 00:07:44.959
but also not to engage in this
grander,

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:50.196
or you might even say grandiose
plan of supplanting of the

00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:54.329
Athenians, which would include
necessarily,

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:59.082
somewhere down the road,
conflict with the Great Persian

00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:00.825
Empire.
Of course,

00:08:00.825 --> 00:08:05.031
the Great Persian Empire didn't
seem so scary as it had at one

00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:07.578
time in the past.
Remember the Athenians had

00:08:07.578 --> 00:08:10.275
defeated the Persians--first of
all, the Greeks had done that

00:08:10.275 --> 00:08:12.245
back in 480,
479 but even so,

00:08:12.245 --> 00:08:16.778
ever since then the Athenians
had repeatedly defeated the

00:08:16.778 --> 00:08:19.060
Persians,
over and over again.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.959
So, they weren't anything like
the scary thing they had been at

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.641
the beginning of the century.
But in any case,

00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:29.258
you'd have to take that on and
many a Spartan would have been

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:33.409
deterred by that prospect,
and again by the prospect of

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:36.837
having to have a fleet,
because there was no way to

00:08:36.837 --> 00:08:40.950
pursue this third policy without
having a fleet that began to

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.790
approach the power of the
Athenian fleet when it had been

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.929
strong.
Well, what did that mean?

00:08:46.929 --> 00:08:51.987
It meant using not the
traditional Spartan military

00:08:51.987 --> 00:08:57.349
advantage--hoplite soldiers
fighting infantry battles,

00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:01.799
but also rowers and expert
naval people.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:07.180
I don't have the time to go
into a detailed account of how

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.590
naval warfare was carried on in
the Greek world,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:17.800
but it's easy to forget that in
addition to the rowers of whom

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.076
there were 170 in each trireme,
who were the engine in a sense,

00:09:24.076 --> 00:09:28.969
they made the thing move,
and officers and usually at

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:33.090
least ten or so marines,
who could be landed for

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.417
behaving like hoplites on land.
In addition to them,

00:09:36.417 --> 00:09:39.348
there were critically skilled
people who made all the

00:09:39.348 --> 00:09:42.909
difference in the world,
and whether you won or lost in

00:09:42.909 --> 00:09:46.783
these naval battles--who were
well, they were sort of like

00:09:46.783 --> 00:09:49.909
chief petty officers if you
think about it,

00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:54.894
or its master sergeants in the
Army, professionals whose very

00:09:54.894 --> 00:09:59.712
great skills are critical for
the functioning of the larger

00:09:59.712 --> 00:10:02.529
army.
The Greek word for the most

00:10:02.529 --> 00:10:05.594
important of these was
kubernetes,

00:10:05.594 --> 00:10:08.999
which means steersmen.
They were that and they were

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:11.932
more than that.
By the way, it's a very nice

00:10:11.932 --> 00:10:16.320
word, because all the words that
have to do with governor,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.174
government, govern all derive
ultimately from the

00:10:20.174 --> 00:10:24.399
kubernetes.
So, this would have meant

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:29.457
that all kinds of people who
were not Spartiates would be

00:10:29.457 --> 00:10:35.509
critical for the success of such
a mission of the overseas type,

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:39.273
and so many a Spartan felt that
was too much of a derangement of

00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:42.259
Spartan life and didn't like it
for that reason.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:46.760
But you could still be in favor
of a middle policy which would

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.408
mean extending Spartan power or
maintaining Spartan power on the

00:10:51.408 --> 00:10:55.117
Greek mainland,
outside the Peloponnesus,

00:10:55.117 --> 00:11:00.009
and there were certain things
that recommended that.

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:05.715
For one thing,
Athens had been knocked out as

00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:11.940
a main power in central Greece
and that meant,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.425
and it had been demonstrated in
the course of the war that it

00:11:15.425 --> 00:11:19.410
meant it, that Thebes,
the dominant power in Boeotia,

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.779
had already grown to
considerable power,

00:11:22.779 --> 00:11:27.529
had developed a degree of
independence which allowed the

00:11:27.529 --> 00:11:32.106
Thebans to challenge the
Spartans frequently and there

00:11:32.106 --> 00:11:37.029
was a very real chance that
Thebes would seek to become at

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:42.393
least a power of the first rank,
at least somebody who could sit

00:11:42.393 --> 00:11:45.982
equally at the table with the
Spartans rather than subordinate

00:11:45.982 --> 00:11:48.453
to them.
The fear that some Spartans

00:11:48.453 --> 00:11:51.688
surely had was that if the
Spartans simply stayed in the

00:11:51.688 --> 00:11:55.266
Peloponnesus,
Thebes would become the master

00:11:55.266 --> 00:12:00.803
of Attica, which was a neighbor
of Thebes, as well as of central

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:06.164
Greece as a whole and suddenly
they would become a real menace

00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:09.274
to the Spartans,
and indeed, down the road,

00:12:09.274 --> 00:12:11.900
if you go far enough,
that's exactly what did happen.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:16.664
So, that would be the case;
well, we need to establish

00:12:16.664 --> 00:12:19.269
ourselves on mainland Greece as
a hegemon,

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:21.595
the masters,
if not--I shouldn't say master,

00:12:21.595 --> 00:12:26.471
a hegemon means leaders.
There's always a conflict there

00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:28.907
too.
When you have a power which is

00:12:28.907 --> 00:12:32.653
superior to that of the other
states, but you don't conquer

00:12:32.653 --> 00:12:35.060
them,
the question is do you want to

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.085
relate to them as the Greeks
would have said as a

00:12:38.085 --> 00:12:40.920
hegemon,
meaning the leader,

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.125
which implies a degree of
voluntary cooperation,

00:12:45.125 --> 00:12:49.482
or do you want to dominate,
which means mastery and

00:12:49.482 --> 00:12:53.044
Spartans disagreed among
themselves as to what was

00:12:53.044 --> 00:12:55.650
necessary,
even if you were going to take

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.261
that path.
But these three roots were

00:12:58.261 --> 00:13:01.262
theoretically,
and I think as a matter of fact

00:13:01.262 --> 00:13:03.919
really,
things that the Spartans argued

00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:07.769
about and there was a certain
amount of moving back and forth

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:11.427
as the Spartans shifted from one
to the other as different

00:13:11.427 --> 00:13:15.470
individuals gained influence and
as circumstances changed.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.309
It's easy to designate at least
two of the factions,

00:13:22.309 --> 00:13:26.008
and I'm inclined to think there
were three that can be

00:13:26.008 --> 00:13:28.940
identified and identified with
people.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.117
The most aggressive,
overseas, let's conquer and

00:13:32.117 --> 00:13:35.904
control everything in the
Aegean--Lysander is clearly the

00:13:35.904 --> 00:13:39.555
leader of that faction.
But "let's stay in the

00:13:39.555 --> 00:13:43.870
Peloponnesus and stay out of
interstate rivalries and

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:48.932
competitions and just go back to
our old ways" appears to have

00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:54.320
been led by the King Pausanias,
and there's another King Agis,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.039
and he is the one that's
unclear.

00:13:57.039 --> 00:14:01.372
It can't be confident that he
represented a third faction but

00:14:01.372 --> 00:14:05.777
I think there's some possibility
that he did and that that was

00:14:05.777 --> 00:14:09.460
the faction that wanted to limit
Spartan power,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.914
influence control to the
mainland of Greece and not to go

00:14:13.914 --> 00:14:17.005
to sea.
There were great arguments

00:14:17.005 --> 00:14:20.895
against the Lysander approach.
For one thing,

00:14:20.895 --> 00:14:26.842
the number of Spartans was
pretty small to control too vast

00:14:26.842 --> 00:14:31.063
a territory.
We can't be sure how many there

00:14:31.063 --> 00:14:36.083
were by now, but it's pretty
well agreed that in the middle

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:40.757
of the Peloponnesian War there
was something like 3,500

00:14:40.757 --> 00:14:45.691
Spartiates, only that many,
and the figure continues to go

00:14:45.691 --> 00:14:48.855
down.
By the time we get to the

00:14:48.855 --> 00:14:53.955
decisive Battle of Leuctra that
defeats Sparta finally in 371

00:14:53.955 --> 00:14:57.610
there is perhaps about 1,000
Spartiates.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.711
Well, how do you run an empire?
Forget about how do you conquer

00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:02.844
one.
How do you run one with that

00:15:02.844 --> 00:15:06.299
kind of population,
and also of course the Spartans

00:15:06.299 --> 00:15:10.238
had traditionally not been a
naval power and had done very

00:15:10.238 --> 00:15:13.970
poorly at sea compared to the
Athenians at least,

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.475
and it was an open question how
well they would do against the

00:15:18.475 --> 00:15:21.799
forces that served the Persian
king at sea.

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:27.727
The fact was true that they
had no experience with money and

00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:33.090
money was a critical part of
maintaining such an empire as

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:39.044
the Athenians could tell them,
and everything in the Spartan

00:15:39.044 --> 00:15:42.370
tradition was based on land
power.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.238
Now, we can over estimate that.
After all, the Spartans had

00:15:45.238 --> 00:15:48.478
been sending fleets out to sea
throughout the Peloponnesian

00:15:48.478 --> 00:15:50.481
War.
In the last part of the war

00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:54.003
they won two important battles
of which the final battle was

00:15:54.003 --> 00:15:56.590
critical,
the Battle of Aegospotami,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.618
but if you really look at the
whole story it's not at all

00:16:00.618 --> 00:16:04.647
clear that the Spartans ever
developed the kind of system

00:16:04.647 --> 00:16:08.820
that would produce a navy that
would year after year,

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.240
after year have the capacity to
dominate the sea.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.970
So, that was a practical
limitation.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.712
Well anyway,
however that might be,

00:16:19.712 --> 00:16:23.850
the man of the hour in 404 was
Lysander,

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:29.748
the great victor of the
Peloponnesian War and his policy

00:16:29.748 --> 00:16:34.204
was the extreme policy,
the "let's conquer it all"

00:16:34.204 --> 00:16:34.750
policy.

00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:43.205
His policy was very much a
personal policy,

00:16:43.205 --> 00:16:46.029
and here the personal is very
important.

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:50.138
The fact that Lysander was who
he was made a very great deal of

00:16:50.138 --> 00:16:53.582
difference;
Lysander was not a pure,

00:16:53.582 --> 00:16:58.778
legitimate Spartiate.
He was what the Spartans called

00:16:58.778 --> 00:17:03.019
a mothax;
he was technically a bastard.

00:17:03.019 --> 00:17:07.878
That means he had a Spartan
father and non-Spartan mother,

00:17:07.878 --> 00:17:11.799
typically such women would have
been helots,

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:16.665
but in any case he was brought
up, nonetheless as a Spartan,

00:17:16.665 --> 00:17:21.695
but not as a Spartiate and how
to put these pieces together is

00:17:21.695 --> 00:17:25.652
very hard to know.
But he did, as a few others

00:17:25.652 --> 00:17:30.253
like him in the last years of
the war, rose to be a general

00:17:30.253 --> 00:17:33.109
and the very best general of
all,

00:17:33.109 --> 00:17:36.140
and the man who was put in
command of the forces.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.509
But he was a man of
extraordinary ambition,

00:17:39.509 --> 00:17:44.125
and the ancient writers tell us
that he had developed the notion

00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:47.934
of actually bringing about a
revolution in Sparta and

00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:52.257
changing the constitution in
such a way that would allow him

00:17:52.257 --> 00:17:55.920
to become effectively the ruler
of Sparta,

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.344
and the kings,
the traditional kings,

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:03.720
who were born to the purple to
be put aside.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.704
Well, if he was going to do
anything like that,

00:18:06.704 --> 00:18:10.401
even if he was only going to
try to retain the position he

00:18:10.401 --> 00:18:13.710
had achieved of tremendous
influence and power,

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.765
he would need to have a
command, he would need to have

00:18:17.765 --> 00:18:22.049
money, he would need to have
supporters of every kind,

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:25.635
and his policy,
therefore, for Sparta was very

00:18:25.635 --> 00:18:29.380
much a policy that fit the needs
of Lysander.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:35.649
Wherever he liberated a
city in Asia Minor,

00:18:35.649 --> 00:18:41.509
which had been under the
Athenian Empire,

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:44.617
part of the Athenian Empire,
he established a different kind

00:18:44.617 --> 00:18:48.072
of government.
It consisted of ten men chosen

00:18:48.072 --> 00:18:52.079
from the local people who were
friendly to him,

00:18:52.079 --> 00:18:56.259
who were reliant on him,
his people, his puppets,

00:18:56.259 --> 00:18:59.501
if you will.
The name for these

00:18:59.501 --> 00:19:03.023
establishments was
decarchies,

00:19:03.023 --> 00:19:05.664
rules of ten,
groups of ten,

00:19:05.664 --> 00:19:11.020
and they were his people.
To make sure that they were

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:15.232
safe he placed a Spartan
garrison, or at least a

00:19:15.232 --> 00:19:20.700
Peloponnesian garrison in that
city led by a Spartan commander

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.757
called a harmost.
It comes from the same word

00:19:25.757 --> 00:19:30.671
from which we get harmony,
somebody who preserved order

00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:35.130
who was the military commander
of that region.

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.636
All of these people,
the harmosts,

00:19:37.636 --> 00:19:40.200
the decarchs were all
his creatures,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.558
not anybody who had any
independent power or influence,

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:49.239
simply his people who did the
job for him and liberators of

00:19:49.239 --> 00:19:52.508
the Greeks,
as they had claimed to be,

00:19:52.508 --> 00:19:56.864
Lysander did not abandon
collecting the money from these

00:19:56.864 --> 00:20:00.190
cities that he had allegedly
liberated;

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:05.018
the same amount apparently that
they had given the Athenians,

00:20:05.018 --> 00:20:08.961
because our sources tell us
that the Spartans were

00:20:08.961 --> 00:20:13.870
collecting 1,000 talents a year
from the newly acquired empire

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:18.780
which is something like what the
Athenians got from it.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:25.296
So, all of that is in place.
This newly founded Spartan

00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:30.990
Empire was different from the
Athenian Empire in a variety of

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.832
ways.
Remember the Athenian Empire,

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:37.997
it started out as a voluntary
association with a very clear

00:20:37.997 --> 00:20:41.528
common purpose,
to liberate those Greeks who

00:20:41.528 --> 00:20:46.163
were still under Persian rule
and to preserve their freedom

00:20:46.163 --> 00:20:50.480
from their Persian neighbors and
former conquerors.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.925
On the other hand,
this new empire under Lysander

00:20:54.925 --> 00:20:59.740
had no purpose and it was not
voluntary in any shape,

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:03.299
manner or form;
it was thoroughly compulsory.

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:09.655
I think it's fair to say that
the Spartans had simply betrayed

00:21:09.655 --> 00:21:16.324
the Asiatic Greeks whom they had
engaged in the rebellion against

00:21:16.324 --> 00:21:21.430
the Athenians and instead of
liberating them,

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:25.486
put them under Spartan rule.
In many cases,

00:21:25.486 --> 00:21:30.278
frequently, these governments
established by Lysander were

00:21:30.278 --> 00:21:34.985
tyrannical and rapacious in
which these governors and the

00:21:34.985 --> 00:21:39.692
harmosts and so on
basically stole what they could

00:21:39.692 --> 00:21:43.653
from the natives;
this is apart from the official

00:21:43.653 --> 00:21:45.910
payments they made to the
Spartans.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.089
They enriched these Lysandrian
creatures.

00:21:50.089 --> 00:21:53.960
As one of our ancient
sources writes,

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.475
the will of any Spartan was
regarded as law in the subject

00:21:59.475 --> 00:22:02.596
cities.
It is clear from all the

00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:07.395
ancient writers that the
Spartans were not easy people in

00:22:07.395 --> 00:22:10.480
their dealings with other
Greeks.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:14.750
Everything in their tradition
made them feel superior to other

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.180
Greeks and they didn't mind
acting in that way.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.177
You remember the stories of how
it was that the Athenian Empire

00:22:22.177 --> 00:22:24.380
was founded,
or rather that Delian

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.032
League--the Spartans had so
alienated all the Greeks in that

00:22:28.032 --> 00:22:31.871
region by the way they treated
them that they were glad to send

00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:35.400
the Spartans away and replace
them by the Athenians,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.149
who did not treat them that
way, at least they didn't do it

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:42.640
for some years before they
developed into an empire.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:48.207
So this was another problem,
Spartans were not good at this

00:22:48.207 --> 00:22:53.869
job, but at the beginning what
was decisive was Lysander.

00:22:53.869 --> 00:22:57.633
He was at the height of his
power and influence,

00:22:57.633 --> 00:23:01.691
and I guess it's fair to say,
he reached heights that no

00:23:01.691 --> 00:23:05.160
mortal ever had reached in the
Greek world.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:10.339
The oligarchs whom he had
restored to power in Samos loved

00:23:10.339 --> 00:23:15.519
him so much, and were so
grateful for what he had done,

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:20.410
that they held religious
ceremonies on the island and

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:25.170
literally worshipped Lysander,
as a god.

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:30.011
This is the first time in Greek
history that anybody had

00:23:30.011 --> 00:23:33.338
received such treatment.
On the one hand,

00:23:33.338 --> 00:23:37.426
this elevated his influence and
power, everybody wondered at him

00:23:37.426 --> 00:23:39.597
and so on.
On the other hand,

00:23:39.597 --> 00:23:43.283
it presented a problem,
because you can imagine how

00:23:43.283 --> 00:23:46.970
that went down among the
aristocrats of Sparta,

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.540
and most particularly with the
Kings of Sparta,

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.575
to see that this--I use a
technical term not a street

00:23:54.575 --> 00:23:58.494
curse word,
this bastard was now being

00:23:58.494 --> 00:24:03.366
worshipped as a god,
and of course that kind of

00:24:03.366 --> 00:24:10.039
eminence was unheard of for a
non-king in the Spartan world.

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:13.259
So, that had all kinds of
trouble down the road.

00:24:13.259 --> 00:24:17.647
He was as ambitious as he
could be, and it was as obvious

00:24:17.647 --> 00:24:20.989
as it could be.
So, there was jealousy and

00:24:20.989 --> 00:24:25.832
resentment and fear at Sparta
that something bad was going to

00:24:25.832 --> 00:24:28.819
happen to the Spartan way of
life,

00:24:28.819 --> 00:24:33.050
to the Spartan constitution,
and Pausanias and his

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:38.057
tradionalists bided their time
for the opportunity to put a

00:24:38.057 --> 00:24:42.834
spike into this development.
There were other things that

00:24:42.834 --> 00:24:46.719
were flowing from what I've
already described that were

00:24:46.719 --> 00:24:50.819
threatening the traditional
character of Spartan life.

00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:55.809
This money, of course,
allowed for corruption.

00:24:55.809 --> 00:25:00.709
Now, people who had money could
buy people's support,

00:25:00.709 --> 00:25:05.326
could buy people's help in
their own endeavors for

00:25:05.326 --> 00:25:09.934
influence and power in Sparta.
One of the things that we

00:25:09.934 --> 00:25:12.645
hear about that most scholars
would like to place in this

00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:15.082
period,
and it seems reasonable to me,

00:25:15.082 --> 00:25:17.230
was a new law about
inheritance;

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:22.630
that's the Law of Epitadeus.
He is the man who proposed it.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:28.501
It used to be that inheritance
automatically went in a certain

00:25:28.501 --> 00:25:31.869
direction, nobody had any
choice.

00:25:31.869 --> 00:25:35.257
You couldn't make out a will
and leave it to anybody you

00:25:35.257 --> 00:25:37.511
liked.
It went through the family

00:25:37.511 --> 00:25:41.623
according to a certain pattern.
The Law of Epitadeus changed

00:25:41.623 --> 00:25:45.354
that.
You know could write a will and

00:25:45.354 --> 00:25:51.770
select your successors however
you wished, your inheritors.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.360
That meant that there were ways
you could work around that so as

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.150
to buy somebody right while you
were still alive.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.299
If you wrote somebody into
your will, you were in effect

00:26:09.299 --> 00:26:14.037
giving him money after you died.
So, meanwhile he could serve

00:26:14.037 --> 00:26:17.140
you and be your political
supporter.

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:22.114
That was happening and people
who had been raised as Spartans

00:26:22.114 --> 00:26:26.425
and expected to inherit their
father's property would

00:26:26.425 --> 00:26:31.234
sometimes find that they had
been cut out and now they were

00:26:31.234 --> 00:26:35.766
Spartiates by birth,
but they lacked the necessary

00:26:35.766 --> 00:26:40.273
wealth, necessary land to
provide for their meals at the

00:26:40.273 --> 00:26:45.518
common mess and so they could no
longer be Spartiates in the full

00:26:45.518 --> 00:26:48.728
sense.
A term was discovered for them,

00:26:48.728 --> 00:26:52.229
they were called
hypomeiones, which means

00:26:52.229 --> 00:26:56.623
inferiors and some of the guys
who rose to power late in the

00:26:56.623 --> 00:27:01.418
Peloponnesian War as generals,
because they were just good at

00:27:01.418 --> 00:27:05.819
it, came from some such class.
So, you have a variety of

00:27:05.819 --> 00:27:09.214
Spartans who are important,
who are not helots,

00:27:09.214 --> 00:27:13.420
who are not people you could
just do what you want to.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.852
They play a significant role in
society but they don't have the

00:27:16.852 --> 00:27:20.367
position of honor,
the position of belonging that

00:27:20.367 --> 00:27:24.540
was necessary and these were
disruptive and troubling

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.510
developments in the Spartan
state.

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:33.250
We get a clue about this;
in 398.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:39.380
We hear about the planning of a
revolution in the city.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.335
A man by the name of Cynadon,
who was one of these

00:27:43.335 --> 00:27:46.724
hypomeiones,
was planning to have an

00:27:46.724 --> 00:27:51.567
uprising in which they would
kill lots of Spartans and set up

00:27:51.567 --> 00:27:56.007
a new regime that would give
room to the people who were

00:27:56.007 --> 00:28:00.078
outsiders.
Well, the plot was prevented,

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:05.224
because one of the people that
Cynadon approached told the

00:28:05.224 --> 00:28:10.370
story to Spartan magistrates and
the plot was averted.

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:15.244
But the story he told was this.
He was standing one day in the

00:28:15.244 --> 00:28:18.869
agora in Sparta,
and Cynadon approached him and

00:28:18.869 --> 00:28:24.150
he said look around you he said,
how many Spartiates do you see?

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:28.323
Well, the answer was forty.
He said, and how many people

00:28:28.323 --> 00:28:31.090
are there around here who are
not Spartiates?

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:35.805
He said about 4,000.
He was talking about

00:28:35.805 --> 00:28:38.941
hypomeiones,
neodamodes,

00:28:38.941 --> 00:28:43.095
various other sub-species but
also helots and also

00:28:43.095 --> 00:28:48.732
perioikoi,
and said Cynadon to the men he

00:28:48.732 --> 00:28:54.641
was trying to recruit,
these 4,000 as regards to

00:28:54.641 --> 00:28:59.420
Spartans would gladly eat them
raw.

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.790
So, his message was why
don't we have a little

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.703
revolution?
Well, the answer was he was

00:29:04.703 --> 00:29:09.353
forestalled, but it does tell
you that the situation had

00:29:09.353 --> 00:29:14.849
become sufficiently dangerous
that such a possibility existed.

00:29:14.849 --> 00:29:19.540
So, there is Sparta coping with
these various problems and

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:24.312
trying to decide how to handle
their future and I'd like to

00:29:24.312 --> 00:29:29.375
shift the scene now to Athens.
Athens, which had been the

00:29:29.375 --> 00:29:33.295
greatest empire that the Greeks
had ever seen,

00:29:33.295 --> 00:29:36.779
had been reduced now to total
defeat,

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:40.591
absolutely at the mercy of the
Spartans, and indeed,

00:29:40.591 --> 00:29:44.477
the Athenians feared and
certainly had reason to fear

00:29:44.477 --> 00:29:48.662
that the same fate they had
visited upon some states that

00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:53.071
had defied them and there were
two that fit the category I'm

00:29:53.071 --> 00:29:57.617
about to mention,
Melos, the island that was

00:29:57.617 --> 00:30:02.945
conquered by the Athenians.
Thucydides describes how the

00:30:02.945 --> 00:30:07.750
Athenians spoke to them in the
famous Melian dialogue,

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:13.480
and also a place that most
people don't remember but

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.636
another town in Thrace.
In both places,

00:30:17.636 --> 00:30:22.841
the Athenians killed all the
adult males on the island when

00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:28.406
they had finally put an end to
the siege and sold the women and

00:30:28.406 --> 00:30:32.411
children into slavery.
The Athenians had every

00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:35.750
reason to fear that that might
be what happened to them.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.893
As a matter of fact,
Corinth and Thebes,

00:30:37.893 --> 00:30:41.245
in the conference they had at
the end of the war said let's do

00:30:41.245 --> 00:30:44.332
that.
Thebans especially said,

00:30:44.332 --> 00:30:48.329
let's turn Attica into pasture
land.

00:30:48.329 --> 00:30:52.678
Well, the Spartans didn't do it
and the reason they gave was

00:30:52.678 --> 00:30:56.880
well it would be wrong to treat
such a people that way,

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.886
such a people who helped us in
such a critical way as our

00:30:59.886 --> 00:31:02.839
partner against the Persians
when we won our freedom.

00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:05.210
Well, if you can believe that,
you can believe anything.

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.079
More to the point I think was
their fear, that if they did

00:31:09.079 --> 00:31:12.813
destroy Attica--I mean the
houses and the people and all

00:31:12.813 --> 00:31:16.871
that, what would have happened?
This would really be a vacuum

00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:20.291
of people, of everything else
and it's certainly a vacuum of

00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:23.190
power, and it wouldn't stay that
way very long.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:27.292
Thebes and its Boeotian
subordinates would come in and

00:31:27.292 --> 00:31:30.930
occupy it and that was not a
desirable thing.

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:34.349
So, the Spartans didn't do
that.

00:31:34.349 --> 00:31:38.628
Instead, with Lysander very
much in charge of the settlement

00:31:38.628 --> 00:31:42.109
that was going to be imposed on
the Athenians,

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:48.170
they placed in power a small
group of oligarchic Athenians

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:54.656
just as--by the way he had the
same kind of people in the rest

00:31:54.656 --> 00:31:57.620
of the empire,
but not ten.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.945
Athens was a very big place.
Turned out that there were to

00:32:01.945 --> 00:32:08.169
be thirty of these new rulers of
Attica, all of whom had to meet

00:32:08.169 --> 00:32:13.009
the criterion of being
acceptable to Lysander,

00:32:13.009 --> 00:32:16.954
and the leaders of which,
the really important top gun

00:32:16.954 --> 00:32:19.559
was a man by the name of
Critias,

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:23.602
a nobleman who had participated
in democracy,

00:32:23.602 --> 00:32:27.369
but had turned very sharply
against it.

00:32:27.369 --> 00:32:31.942
He was a brilliant man
apparently, he had been trained

00:32:31.942 --> 00:32:37.031
by the great rhetorician and
sophist Gorgias and he was also

00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:42.121
in the circle of Socrates,
along with Plato and Xenophon

00:32:42.121 --> 00:32:47.037
and various other bright young
men of the upper classes in

00:32:47.037 --> 00:32:50.667
Athens.
Also, he was a poet,

00:32:50.667 --> 00:32:55.857
an orator himself,
a philosopher and so on and

00:32:55.857 --> 00:33:01.738
some of his fragments,
of some of his works remain for

00:33:01.738 --> 00:33:05.800
us to look at,
but one thing that he was by

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.960
404 was a bitter enemy of the
democracy.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.073
He had been exiled or had
voluntarily taken exile,

00:33:14.073 --> 00:33:17.599
in order to get away from the
democracy,

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:23.037
and he was determined now that
there should be no democracy in

00:33:23.037 --> 00:33:26.099
Athens.
Just to say a word about that

00:33:26.099 --> 00:33:29.600
for a moment.
It was an easy point of view to

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.955
arrive at in 404.
People who were not friendly to

00:33:32.955 --> 00:33:36.866
the democracy could simply point
to the fact that the democracy

00:33:36.866 --> 00:33:40.778
had just lost this great war and
nobody could really understand

00:33:40.778 --> 00:33:44.500
how that had happened given the
great power of Athens,

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:48.122
and of course it was easy to
point to the great event that

00:33:48.122 --> 00:33:52.124
turned the tide against Athens,
the Sicilian Expedition,

00:33:52.124 --> 00:33:55.059
and to say this was an idiotic
idea.

00:33:55.059 --> 00:34:01.295
And it was exactly the kind
of idiotic idea that a democracy

00:34:01.295 --> 00:34:06.937
would come up with so that
democracy itself was seen to be

00:34:06.937 --> 00:34:13.173
not just--how can I put--Let me
say it was seen to be inherently

00:34:13.173 --> 00:34:17.075
wicked,
because it violated what seemed

00:34:17.075 --> 00:34:22.054
to be the truth about human
beings and which was very much a

00:34:22.054 --> 00:34:27.370
part of all Greek tradition from
the first time we hear about it

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:32.628
in Homer until--well forever,
which was, contrary to the

00:34:32.628 --> 00:34:36.670
principle of democracy which is
that all men,

00:34:36.670 --> 00:34:42.182
adult male citizens are equal
in some very fundamental way or

00:34:42.182 --> 00:34:46.193
should be,
was the contrary view which had

00:34:46.193 --> 00:34:50.440
much greater support in Greek
tradition, that no,

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.988
men were in fact divided into
different kinds of people,

00:34:54.988 --> 00:34:59.868
and in fact the Greeks thought
a division into two kinds was

00:34:59.868 --> 00:35:03.483
the right kind,
the most important kind,

00:35:03.483 --> 00:35:08.593
a division between the high and
the low, between the good and

00:35:08.593 --> 00:35:12.375
the bad,
between the noble and the base,

00:35:12.375 --> 00:35:17.239
and each of those pairs they're
all the same people.

00:35:17.239 --> 00:35:19.516
You're rich,
you're wise,

00:35:19.516 --> 00:35:25.016
you're well born or I should
say, you're rich and well born

00:35:25.016 --> 00:35:29.000
therefore you're wise,
or you are not.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.163
If you're not,
you're obviously not equal to

00:35:31.163 --> 00:35:34.232
the other guys and therefore you
shouldn't have anything to do

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:37.757
with ruling anybody.
So, that was the basic

00:35:37.757 --> 00:35:42.750
widespread view of what was
natural in the Greek world.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:47.016
Now, you add to that that
they've just lost this terrible

00:35:47.016 --> 00:35:51.358
war and you could point to what
seemed to you to be both a

00:35:51.358 --> 00:35:55.639
wickedness and foolishness.
How in the world could anybody

00:35:55.639 --> 00:35:58.519
think democracy was a good thing
after that?

00:35:58.519 --> 00:36:01.411
Lest you think there's
something special about that,

00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:04.190
that's such a characteristic of
the human race.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:09.682
Whenever you have a great war,
and if you have two different

00:36:09.682 --> 00:36:14.429
kinds of political systems vying
with each other,

00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:19.159
winning has an amazing effect
on what people think.

00:36:19.159 --> 00:36:26.658
So, take the First World War
when the--let me just say that

00:36:26.658 --> 00:36:34.931
those countries who lost the war
were very open to the idea--they

00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:40.619
typically had been monarchies
and so on,

00:36:40.619 --> 00:36:44.247
but they had been rather,
relatively speaking,

00:36:44.247 --> 00:36:48.401
liberal monarchies.
They had legislatures and

00:36:48.401 --> 00:36:54.309
elections and things like that,
and this came to be seen as a

00:36:54.309 --> 00:36:59.724
losing proposition and so
fascism of one sort or another

00:36:59.724 --> 00:37:04.647
took root across Europe in
states that had had that

00:37:04.647 --> 00:37:08.798
misfortune.
And it was felt that success or

00:37:08.798 --> 00:37:13.019
failure had to do with the
rightness or the wrongness of

00:37:13.019 --> 00:37:17.777
wisdom of the foolishness of the
kinds of arrangements that you

00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:22.458
had.Then while the Soviet
Union was powerful and expanding

00:37:22.458 --> 00:37:26.075
around the world,
it was expanding in part,

00:37:26.075 --> 00:37:29.840
along with the idea of
communism, which was thought in

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:33.462
the circles where it succeeded
to be superior to the

00:37:33.462 --> 00:37:36.511
competition,
and observed that when the

00:37:36.511 --> 00:37:40.832
Soviet Union finally collapsed,
there may be communists around

00:37:40.832 --> 00:37:44.019
the world anymore but they don't
admit it.

00:37:44.019 --> 00:37:46.289
I mean, they call themselves
something else.

00:37:46.289 --> 00:37:51.606
The idea has been discredited
by success of the competition,

00:37:51.606 --> 00:37:56.179
by failure of that thing.
So, it's a phenomenon that is

00:37:56.179 --> 00:38:00.385
not amazing, even if this looks
like the earliest example,

00:38:00.385 --> 00:38:04.980
I think, that we know.
So Critias, in any case,

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:11.170
was determined that Athens in
the future would not be a

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:15.078
democracy.
In fact, it looks like he was

00:38:15.078 --> 00:38:18.330
very much taken--again,
this is typical,

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:23.500
with the virtues of Sparta,
because Sparta had won the war.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:27.914
So, it's easy to say the
characteristics that the Spartan

00:38:27.914 --> 00:38:32.422
state had must be good ones,
because they can do the most

00:38:32.422 --> 00:38:37.165
critical thing that a state can
do, win in competition with the

00:38:37.165 --> 00:38:40.959
other states.
So, he had in mind a very

00:38:40.959 --> 00:38:45.022
narrow oligarchy.
One scholar has suggested he

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:49.289
actually had in mind to
establish in Athens the closest

00:38:49.289 --> 00:38:53.239
facsimile he could of the
Spartan Constitution;

00:38:53.239 --> 00:38:56.205
it could never be exactly the
same, but he was trying to do

00:38:56.205 --> 00:38:58.922
something like that.
That could be true,

00:38:58.922 --> 00:39:03.700
but it was going to be narrow,
a smallish number of people

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:09.329
were going to control the city.
In fact--well, let me back up;

00:39:09.329 --> 00:39:11.469
I'll come back to what I was
about to say.

00:39:11.469 --> 00:39:15.832
Now, however,
when they set up the Thirty to

00:39:15.832 --> 00:39:20.288
rule Athens in 404,
it was apparent to people who

00:39:20.288 --> 00:39:25.579
could judge matters pretty
sensibly that given that Athens

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:31.055
had been a democracy for over
100 years that it would not be

00:39:31.055 --> 00:39:37.160
easy to impose such a regime,
and that if you made the regime

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:42.501
too narrow and too oligarchical,
you might find yourself having

00:39:42.501 --> 00:39:46.550
trouble in keeping your new
regime in power.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:53.798
So, Lysander agreed to the idea
of making the Thirty compose of

00:39:53.798 --> 00:39:57.889
twenty men who were Critias'
men,

00:39:57.889 --> 00:40:02.431
very extreme oligarchs,
but allowing Theramenes,

00:40:02.431 --> 00:40:07.167
an Athenian general,
who had flourished during the

00:40:07.167 --> 00:40:10.842
democracy,
but who was very clearly not an

00:40:10.842 --> 00:40:15.955
old fashioned democrat.
He had taken part in bringing

00:40:15.955 --> 00:40:22.471
about the oligarchic revolution
of 400 in the year 411 and

00:40:22.471 --> 00:40:25.074
again,
the group who had made that

00:40:25.074 --> 00:40:28.398
revolution was divided in
something like the same way with

00:40:28.398 --> 00:40:30.780
the Thirty would be,
that is to say,

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.833
extreme oligarchs and people
like Theramenes,

00:40:33.833 --> 00:40:37.510
whom I guess it's fair to call
moderate oligarchs,

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:41.842
although oligarchs only,
I think, in comparison with a

00:40:41.842 --> 00:40:45.992
thorough going democracy.
If you asked Theramenes,

00:40:45.992 --> 00:40:49.600
what would be the right number
of people in Athens to

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.181
participate in the government,
his answer was,

00:40:53.181 --> 00:40:57.830
as it turned out 5,000,
but he really wasn't interested

00:40:57.830 --> 00:41:01.627
in that number.
What he was interested in was

00:41:01.627 --> 00:41:06.432
the criteria for participation
in government and that was to be

00:41:06.432 --> 00:41:10.407
a hoplite,
to have the wealth necessary to

00:41:10.407 --> 00:41:13.949
fight in the infantry for your
city.

00:41:13.949 --> 00:41:17.173
In a later sense,
it's not too much later,

00:41:17.173 --> 00:41:21.340
it was discovered that the
number of men in Athens who

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.721
actually fit that description
was not 5,000,

00:41:24.721 --> 00:41:29.438
but 9,000 and at a time when
the Athenian population of adult

00:41:29.438 --> 00:41:34.313
males was something like 21,000,
so that nine out of twenty one

00:41:34.313 --> 00:41:39.659
would have been the people who
participated in the regime;

00:41:39.659 --> 00:41:42.601
twelve out of the twenty one
would have been too poor for

00:41:42.601 --> 00:41:45.280
that, would not have been
allowed to participate;

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:49.304
well, that's not a democracy.
It is an oligarchy but it's a

00:41:49.304 --> 00:41:54.127
very broad oligarchy.
The word "moderate," I think,

00:41:54.127 --> 00:41:56.277
applies.
So anyway,

00:41:56.277 --> 00:42:01.354
Theramenes was to be given the
opportunity to appoint nine

00:42:01.354 --> 00:42:05.487
others besides himself,
so there were ten Theramenians,

00:42:05.487 --> 00:42:09.062
twenty supports of Critias in
the Thirty, and that was to turn

00:42:09.062 --> 00:42:11.289
out to be a problem for the
Thirty,

00:42:11.289 --> 00:42:15.791
as it had been for the 400,
because when Theramenes saw

00:42:15.791 --> 00:42:20.459
that his colleagues in the 400
were trying to establish a

00:42:20.459 --> 00:42:23.832
narrow oligarchy,
he led an uprising that

00:42:23.832 --> 00:42:27.923
overthrew that oligarchy and
ended up finally restoring the

00:42:27.923 --> 00:42:30.527
democracy.
So, that's the picture of

00:42:30.527 --> 00:42:34.204
what's going on in Athens.
But Athens, of course,

00:42:34.204 --> 00:42:39.177
was also inhabited at that time
by all of the exiles who had

00:42:39.177 --> 00:42:42.969
been sent into exile during the
democracy,

00:42:42.969 --> 00:42:45.578
and they were bitter enemies of
the democrats,

00:42:45.578 --> 00:42:49.468
at least lots of them were.
So, you had a kind of a

00:42:49.468 --> 00:42:55.423
confrontation of different ideas
and feelings that was a little

00:42:55.423 --> 00:42:59.667
unusual in Athens.
Athens had been a pretty easy

00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:03.969
going place before the war and
even throughout the war,

00:43:03.969 --> 00:43:07.456
through larger Greece,
but now there were very hard

00:43:07.456 --> 00:43:11.222
divisions and very tense
feelings between the different

00:43:11.222 --> 00:43:15.277
groups.
The Thirty ruled between

00:43:15.277 --> 00:43:23.632
September of 404 and May of 403,
just a matter of months as it

00:43:23.632 --> 00:43:26.325
turned out,
although nobody,

00:43:26.325 --> 00:43:29.136
of course, knew it was going to
be so short when things got

00:43:29.136 --> 00:43:31.982
started.
They established a council of

00:43:31.982 --> 00:43:36.527
500--well, that's the same
number as the Athenian council,

00:43:36.527 --> 00:43:40.885
but it was quite different.
It was made up of extreme

00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:44.250
oligarchs;
they were given judicial powers.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:48.855
Men who were identified as
sycophants, and the Greek use of

00:43:48.855 --> 00:43:54.197
that term, you remember,
is people who made money out of

00:43:54.197 --> 00:44:00.117
denouncing people on false
charges in the courts and then

00:44:00.117 --> 00:44:05.651
winning payments as a result.
They were very widely unpopular

00:44:05.651 --> 00:44:09.330
even in the democracy,
and so the Thirty began with an

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:13.009
act that was not unpopular by
putting to death all the

00:44:13.009 --> 00:44:16.480
sycophants that they could find
and identify,

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:21.875
but they also put to death well
known leaders of the democracy,

00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:27.010
people whom they knew would be
their political opponents.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:31.647
So, it was bloody from the
first, but it was only limited

00:44:31.647 --> 00:44:35.540
to a certain small portion of
the population.

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:41.738
The Thirty--just to make
the case that--actually a man

00:44:41.738 --> 00:44:44.260
who makes his case,
a man named Peter Krentz,

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.970
and he is an old Yalie,
so, we ought to give him

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:47.490
credit.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:54.157
If you look at the Thirty,
if you look at Sparta,

00:44:54.157 --> 00:44:56.090
what comes to your mind?

00:44:59.470 --> 00:45:03.617
The gerousia.
Ultimately, in the course of

00:45:03.617 --> 00:45:07.463
these months,
the Thirty limited citizenship,

00:45:07.463 --> 00:45:12.445
active participation in the
government of any kind to only

00:45:12.445 --> 00:45:17.514
3,000 Athenians out of what
would have been at least 21,000

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:22.059
and probably more.
Only these had citizen rights.

00:45:22.059 --> 00:45:24.139
The rest of the Athenians did
not.

00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:29.597
Well, that's about how many
Spartans there were at this time

00:45:29.597 --> 00:45:32.984
in history.
Another thing they did was

00:45:32.984 --> 00:45:38.193
to--at a certain point when life
got tough, they drove from the

00:45:38.193 --> 00:45:43.150
city of Athens all those who
were not part of the 3,000.

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:46.718
Well, what do you call people
like that who don't live in the

00:45:46.718 --> 00:45:48.800
capital city but who live
around?

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.397
PerioIikoi.
And so that's why Krentz

00:45:52.397 --> 00:45:55.349
suggests that this is not an
accident;

00:45:55.349 --> 00:46:00.518
that it's a conscious effort to
model the future Athenian state

00:46:00.518 --> 00:46:05.019
upon the great successful,
admirable, Spartan state.

00:46:05.019 --> 00:46:07.250
Well, Theramenes didn't
like that.

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:14.785
This was far too narrow and far
too troubling for the future for

00:46:14.785 --> 00:46:17.628
Theramenes.
Indeed, he pointed out the

00:46:17.628 --> 00:46:19.809
contradiction,
he says, how clever is this?

00:46:19.809 --> 00:46:22.344
Here you are,
a minority in the state,

00:46:22.344 --> 00:46:25.906
and instead of trying to bring
on more people to make

00:46:25.906 --> 00:46:29.381
yourselves stronger,
you're driving out people and

00:46:29.381 --> 00:46:33.359
guaranteeing that you will have
more people against you than you

00:46:33.359 --> 00:46:35.794
have for you.
He, himself,

00:46:35.794 --> 00:46:43.033
favored as he had in the time
of the 400, he favored a hoplite

00:46:43.033 --> 00:46:46.103
census.
Anybody who could be a hoplite

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:49.809
could be a full fledged citizen,
and I've told you about the

00:46:49.809 --> 00:46:53.236
numbers.
Well, pretty soon people

00:46:53.236 --> 00:46:59.394
objected to what the Thirty was
doing, made complaints,

00:46:59.394 --> 00:47:04.070
and the Thirty began to go
after them.

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:13.175
One of the problems about
talking about the Thirty is that

00:47:13.175 --> 00:47:16.780
it is not perfectly clear what
is the chronology of events,

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:21.755
and I can't tell you with
certainty in what order these

00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:25.902
things happened,
but at some point in here the

00:47:25.902 --> 00:47:30.969
Thirty began to attack a larger
group of Athenians,

00:47:30.969 --> 00:47:34.587
sometimes because they were
seen to be political opponents,

00:47:34.587 --> 00:47:37.019
or thought to be political
opponents,

00:47:37.019 --> 00:47:39.239
or related to political
opponents.

00:47:39.239 --> 00:47:42.795
Sometimes when things got
really bad, when the Thirty

00:47:42.795 --> 00:47:46.760
needed money they actually put
people to death just because

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.546
they were rich,
so that they could take their

00:47:50.546 --> 00:47:55.003
money away and this of course
increased the amount of

00:47:55.003 --> 00:48:00.516
resistance on unhappiness,
so that finally a small,

00:48:00.516 --> 00:48:07.450
I want to emphasize small,
very small group of Athenians

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:14.889
fled the city and went into
exile to neighboring cities,

00:48:14.889 --> 00:48:18.801
and this is interesting I think
and important,

00:48:18.801 --> 00:48:23.929
the cities that were most
receptive to these anti-Thirty,

00:48:23.929 --> 00:48:27.626
anti-oligarchical,
anti-Spartan people,

00:48:27.626 --> 00:48:32.880
the one who received them most
readily were Corinth,

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.481
Megara, and Thebes,
all enemies of Athens,

00:48:38.481 --> 00:48:44.309
all enemies of democracy.
Why are they doing this?

00:48:44.309 --> 00:48:47.935
The answer is,
they are both angry at the

00:48:47.935 --> 00:48:53.282
Spartans and I think fearful
that the Sparta that is arising

00:48:53.282 --> 00:48:57.179
now will be a menace to their
autonomy.

00:48:57.179 --> 00:49:02.050
These particular towns were
angry about different things.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.961
Corinth and Thebes,
you remember,

00:49:03.961 --> 00:49:07.187
had wanted to destroy Athens
entirely, and the Spartans

00:49:07.187 --> 00:49:10.955
hadn't listened to them.
They all shared in the fighting

00:49:10.955 --> 00:49:14.403
during that long war,
but they did not share equally

00:49:14.403 --> 00:49:18.527
and not enough to suit them in
the booty that was taken at the

00:49:18.527 --> 00:49:21.736
end of the war.
So, there were grievances that

00:49:21.736 --> 00:49:24.644
these towns had,
and so they accepted this small

00:49:24.644 --> 00:49:28.295
number of Athenians and the one
town that was most important

00:49:28.295 --> 00:49:34.260
from this purpose was Thebes.
In Thebes they were given a

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.631
decent home.
The Spartans,

00:49:37.631 --> 00:49:43.212
knowing about this,
sent out an order saying that

00:49:43.212 --> 00:49:48.909
no state should give any home to
these exiles,

00:49:48.909 --> 00:49:53.585
whereupon, the Theban regime at
the moment voted that anybody

00:49:53.585 --> 00:49:58.260
who didn't give help to these
Athenians would be punished.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.659
They simply were defying the
Spartans on this question.

00:50:02.659 --> 00:50:05.532
The leader,
the most important of the

00:50:05.532 --> 00:50:09.410
leaders of this group of
exiles--it's fair to call them

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:13.141
democratic exiles,
they wished to restore the old

00:50:13.141 --> 00:50:16.800
democracy, the most important
man was Thrasybulus,

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.298
who had been a general,
his best fighting had been done

00:50:21.298 --> 00:50:26.630
as an admiral during the latter
part of the Peloponnesian War.

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:29.700
He was present at all the great
Athenian victories,

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:33.630
and he was not present at the
great defeat that ended the war.

00:50:36.889 --> 00:50:41.946
He and another important
politician by the name of Anytus

00:50:41.946 --> 00:50:46.912
actually began a counter
revolution and the--with a very

00:50:46.912 --> 00:50:51.559
small number of men.
The sources differ but the

00:50:51.559 --> 00:50:57.377
accounts that seem to be most
plausible, with only 70 men they

00:50:57.377 --> 00:51:02.527
went from Thebes to a natural
fortress in the mountains

00:51:02.527 --> 00:51:07.743
between Boeotia and Attica,
a placed called Phyle,

00:51:07.743 --> 00:51:13.643
and built a fort there to which
they hoped other discontented

00:51:13.643 --> 00:51:19.150
Athenians would flee and join
them in the resistance.

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:21.804
I'm using the word
resistance, and it brings to

00:51:21.804 --> 00:51:25.041
mind of course an analogy that
has always struck me as helpful

00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:28.120
in comprehending the situation
confronting the Athenians at

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.056
this time.
To my mind, it is helpful to

00:51:32.056 --> 00:51:38.120
think about France in June of
1940 after the Germans had

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:44.404
defeated France and occupied
part of it and left the other

00:51:44.404 --> 00:51:50.578
part unoccupied,
but absolutely beholden to the

00:51:50.578 --> 00:51:54.678
Nazi Regime.
Now, a Frenchmen had three

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:58.039
choices, just as the Athenians
did.

00:51:58.039 --> 00:52:02.650
One possibility would be to
join up with the new regime and

00:52:02.650 --> 00:52:07.340
try to prosper as part of it and
some Athenians did that.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.818
Others would do what
Thrasybulus did,

00:52:10.818 --> 00:52:15.650
and in France it was the De
Gaulle who did this,

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:18.346
he happened to be in London at
the time this happened and he

00:52:18.346 --> 00:52:21.405
began to organize,
to undue what had happened,

00:52:21.405 --> 00:52:25.855
and to throw the Germans out,
established the free French

00:52:25.855 --> 00:52:28.501
forces.
It's important to realize that

00:52:28.501 --> 00:52:31.586
after the war was over,
it's amazing how large that

00:52:31.586 --> 00:52:34.610
free French force had grown in
people's minds.

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:38.110
In reality, it was a handful of
people.

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:42.691
That's the way it always is and
that's the way it was in Athens

00:52:42.691 --> 00:52:45.142
as well.
It was a terrifying

00:52:45.142 --> 00:52:49.237
prospect to tackle this regime,
which looked like it was

00:52:49.237 --> 00:52:52.153
unbeatable.
Remember, they had been put in

00:52:52.153 --> 00:52:55.630
place by the Spartans.
The Spartans ruled the world.

00:52:55.630 --> 00:53:00.250
What could anybody expect to
change that situation?

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.638
Just as the Nazis looked like
they were in business for the

00:53:03.638 --> 00:53:07.260
thousand years that Hitler had
claimed he was going to have.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.711
So, it didn't look like you
were a very courageous man if

00:53:11.711 --> 00:53:15.807
you joined De Gaulle.
How many of you have seen

00:53:15.807 --> 00:53:19.443
Casablanca?
Okay, at least you've seen one

00:53:19.443 --> 00:53:22.260
movie in your life;
that's great.

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.634
But you remember,
what are Claude Raines and

00:53:25.634 --> 00:53:29.480
Bogey doing at the end of the
war when he says,

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.945
Louie I think this is the
beginning of a beautiful

00:53:31.945 --> 00:53:34.643
friendship.
When he says that they're going

00:53:34.643 --> 00:53:37.280
to Brazzaville to join the free
French.

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:41.750
Well great, but what did people
think about De Gaullel?

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:44.882
They thought he was a goddamn
fool, there was no chance,

00:53:44.882 --> 00:53:47.331
this was idiocy,
sensible men--what are they

00:53:47.331 --> 00:53:50.204
trying to do?
They tried to win as much as

00:53:50.204 --> 00:53:54.012
they could in collaborating with
the Germans just to make

00:53:54.012 --> 00:53:58.295
their--the fate of the Frenchman
less hard and to help France in

00:53:58.295 --> 00:54:01.491
the future in that way.
That's the way it was with most

00:54:01.491 --> 00:54:02.972
Athenians;
most Frenchman and most

00:54:02.972 --> 00:54:04.929
Athenians didn't do either of
those things.

00:54:04.929 --> 00:54:09.966
They kept their heads down and
tried to live their lives as

00:54:09.966 --> 00:54:13.447
best they could.
I think what you need to

00:54:13.447 --> 00:54:17.625
understand is happening and this
all puts what Thrasybulus and

00:54:17.625 --> 00:54:20.491
Anytus,
and their friends did in a very

00:54:20.491 --> 00:54:24.526
special kind of a light.
These were extraordinarily

00:54:24.526 --> 00:54:29.604
brave, extraordinarily rash,
and extraordinarily optimistic

00:54:29.604 --> 00:54:32.258
people,
and as it happened in this

00:54:32.258 --> 00:54:34.719
case, it worked for them
amazingly.

00:54:34.719 --> 00:54:40.360
They begin to gather forces
that are helping them.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:44.860
Another interesting point is
that it's remarkable how few of

00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:49.590
the people with Thrasybulus were
actually Athenian citizens.

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:53.943
A surprising number of them
were permanent resident aliens,

00:54:53.943 --> 00:54:55.519
metics,
who,

00:54:55.519 --> 00:54:58.323
of course, were great targets
for the Thirty,

00:54:58.323 --> 00:55:01.699
because they were typically
well off and had money,

00:55:01.699 --> 00:55:04.458
and of course they had no
rights and no power,

00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:07.279
so many of them,
most of the meyics were

00:55:07.279 --> 00:55:10.590
certainly on the democratic side
of this argument;

00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:14.771
many of them went to fight.
Others, like Lysias the

00:55:14.771 --> 00:55:20.378
orator, used his money to hire
mercenary soldiers to fight for

00:55:20.378 --> 00:55:23.780
the Thrasybulus democrats as
well.

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:27.409
Well, the first test came in
the month of January.

00:55:27.409 --> 00:55:32.756
There were these seventy guys
or so up in the fortress on

00:55:32.756 --> 00:55:35.788
Phyle.
By now the Thirty were worried

00:55:35.788 --> 00:55:40.400
enough about this nascent army
to send an army of their own,

00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.088
much bigger,
to try to get them and it's at

00:55:43.088 --> 00:55:45.519
this point that I'm always
reminded,

00:55:45.519 --> 00:55:52.628
again, talk about analogies of
the events of Great Britain in

00:55:52.628 --> 00:55:58.315
the sixteenth-century England,
I should say really,

00:55:58.315 --> 00:56:03.623
when the Spanish Armada was
heading for England trying to

00:56:03.623 --> 00:56:09.500
gain control of the island for
the Pope and Catholicism and one

00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:14.052
thing and another.
And what happened was that

00:56:14.052 --> 00:56:18.432
nature, if you will,
or as the British thought of

00:56:18.432 --> 00:56:21.517
it,
maybe God intervened as the

00:56:21.517 --> 00:56:26.873
Armada was coming out a great
wind came up and it blew the

00:56:26.873 --> 00:56:31.760
ships out of their path and
wrecked many of them.

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:36.339
And really the British--the
English fleet didn't do anywhere

00:56:36.339 --> 00:56:40.699
near as much damage to the
Spanish fleet as did the winds.

00:56:40.699 --> 00:56:46.301
So, from that day forward there
sprang up the legend in England

00:56:46.301 --> 00:56:50.752
of the Protestant Wind,
which had come along to save

00:56:50.752 --> 00:56:54.980
the new English faith against
the forces of the Pope.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:59.041
Well, if they can invent a
Protestant Wind I think it's

00:56:59.041 --> 00:57:03.404
okay for me to speak about the
democratic snow that fell on

00:57:03.404 --> 00:57:06.940
Phyle that went--that's just
what happened.

00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:10.368
A big snow storm came up,
and so when the forces of the

00:57:10.368 --> 00:57:14.050
Thirty came after Thrasybulus,
they just couldn't do it.

00:57:14.050 --> 00:57:16.732
They just couldn't get there;
they were fought off and they

00:57:16.732 --> 00:57:19.066
had to retreat.
And as they retreated the

00:57:19.066 --> 00:57:23.040
seventy came down after them and
chased them, and killed them as

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.413
they fled,
and did a certain amount of

00:57:25.413 --> 00:57:28.232
damage, and the time,
the passage of time was very

00:57:28.232 --> 00:57:31.391
important,
because more and more Athenians

00:57:31.391 --> 00:57:35.669
were becoming hostile to the
regime that they had fallen

00:57:35.669 --> 00:57:38.246
under.
And they, more and more of

00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:41.710
them, although again,
it's amazing how few actual

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:46.639
Athenians joined Thrasybulus,
but by this time Theramenes had

00:57:46.639 --> 00:57:51.963
come into the picture.He was
more and more unhappy with what

00:57:51.963 --> 00:57:55.990
was happening,
he stood up in the council and

00:57:55.990 --> 00:58:00.653
argued against Critias,
and Critias finally had him put

00:58:00.653 --> 00:58:04.857
to death.
That was an indication of how

00:58:04.857 --> 00:58:10.320
far the reactionary forces in
the state had come,

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:16.103
and we might mention also that
the ancient sources estimate

00:58:16.103 --> 00:58:21.587
that something like 1,500
Athenians may have been killed

00:58:21.587 --> 00:58:25.571
by the Thirty tyrants.
Well, that's a very large

00:58:25.571 --> 00:58:28.744
percentage of the population
when you think about how many

00:58:28.744 --> 00:58:31.327
Athenians there were.
And finally,

00:58:31.327 --> 00:58:37.255
that caused so many of their
relatives and friends to turn

00:58:37.255 --> 00:58:41.519
against the Thirty and to join
forces,

00:58:41.519 --> 00:58:43.758
even if they didn't go out
there and fight,

00:58:43.758 --> 00:58:45.730
to be on the side of the
democrats.

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:50.955
A second attack on Phyle,
taken at a later time,

00:58:50.955 --> 00:58:56.385
failed and now suddenly
Thrasybulus had a large enough

00:58:56.385 --> 00:58:59.790
force,
he marched to the Piraeus and

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:04.437
gained control of that.
When the Thirty brought an army

00:59:04.437 --> 00:59:08.670
out to try to defeat him there
he defeated them.

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:14.937
They were forced to flee to
Eleusis on the northwestern

00:59:14.937 --> 00:59:20.044
frontier of Attica,
and the democrats were in

00:59:20.044 --> 00:59:25.500
position to take control of the
city again.

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:30.706
The Thirty were deposed by the
3,000, because it was obvious

00:59:30.706 --> 00:59:35.913
they were losers and now the
3,000, the successor government

00:59:35.913 --> 00:59:39.531
to the Thirty,
appealed to Sparta for help

00:59:39.531 --> 00:59:45.179
against this democratic army
that Thrasybulus had put out.

00:59:45.179 --> 00:59:49.000
Well, think about what
should Sparta do?

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.630
Now, you might have thought it
would be obvious.

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:53.489
Certainly what Lysander wanted
to do is no surprise.

00:59:53.489 --> 00:59:58.501
He wanted to send a big army to
restore the oligarchs to put his

00:59:58.501 --> 01:00:01.955
own people back in power,
and of course,

01:00:01.955 --> 01:00:06.152
that was fine,
but there were people in Sparta

01:00:06.152 --> 01:00:11.354
who didn't want to do that,
who saw this as an opportunity

01:00:11.354 --> 01:00:16.324
to deprive Lysander of his power
and influence and to restore a

01:00:16.324 --> 01:00:21.108
more normal situation in Sparta.
So the Spartans did vote to

01:00:21.108 --> 01:00:24.478
send an army in there to deal
with Thrasybulus,

01:00:24.478 --> 01:00:28.874
but they did not put Lysander
at the head of the army or even

01:00:28.874 --> 01:00:34.211
one of his people.
Instead King Pausanias was sent

01:00:34.211 --> 01:00:38.784
out to do the job.
Well, they met the Athenian

01:00:38.784 --> 01:00:43.019
army under Thrasybulus and
defeated Thrasybulus,

01:00:43.019 --> 01:00:47.341
but they did not try to
obliterate that army,

01:00:47.341 --> 01:00:51.761
or as we shall see,
treat them as very serious

01:00:51.761 --> 01:00:53.988
enemies.
For one thing,

01:00:53.988 --> 01:00:57.599
the Athenians again as they had
in the past, fought bravely and

01:00:57.599 --> 01:01:00.920
well and inflicted serious
losses on the Spartan army,

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:05.654
but also it was obvious that
Pausanias was willing to

01:01:05.654 --> 01:01:09.555
negotiate a settlement.
He wasn't insistent upon

01:01:09.555 --> 01:01:13.010
defeating the Athenians and
imposing a settlement.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:17.554
So, they worked out an
agreement whereby a moderate

01:01:17.554 --> 01:01:22.734
group of ten would be chosen in
Athens and Pausanias and a

01:01:22.734 --> 01:01:28.369
commission sent from Sparta to
sit with Pausanias sat down with

01:01:28.369 --> 01:01:34.639
these Athenians and worked out a
reconciliation for the future.

01:01:34.639 --> 01:01:37.909
Here's the essence of what was
worked out.

01:01:37.909 --> 01:01:42.227
A very important part of the
story was that they voted--the

01:01:42.227 --> 01:01:46.623
Athenians did and Pausanias,
of course, would have insisted

01:01:46.623 --> 01:01:51.022
on it too--an amnesty whereby
there would be no punishment for

01:01:51.022 --> 01:01:55.349
people on one side or the other
of the quarrel in Athens.

01:01:55.349 --> 01:01:59.201
Of course, the people who would
have been punished would have

01:01:59.201 --> 01:02:03.309
been oligarchs and their friends
who were now the losing side.

01:02:03.309 --> 01:02:07.050
There would be an amnesty for
anybody, no matter what,

01:02:07.050 --> 01:02:09.519
except for the Thirty
themselves,

01:02:09.519 --> 01:02:14.554
the ten that the Thirty had put
in charge of the Piraeus,

01:02:14.554 --> 01:02:18.780
the eleven--the eleven were the
police force,

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:23.357
so to speak,
the head of the security forces

01:02:23.357 --> 01:02:27.588
in Athens and so on.
Small groups of people who were

01:02:27.588 --> 01:02:31.001
thought to be especially
responsible for the nasty things

01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:34.492
that had happened in Athens,
but even they were not

01:02:34.492 --> 01:02:38.417
summarily put to death.
They could submit their

01:02:38.417 --> 01:02:43.718
accounts at an euthyna
and if they were cleared at

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:49.019
these jury trials--I shouldn't
call them jury trials,

01:02:49.019 --> 01:02:51.876
tribunals really,
they could take up their

01:02:51.876 --> 01:02:55.289
position as citizens in the new
Athens as well,

01:02:55.289 --> 01:02:59.394
or they could be allowed freely
to leave Athens without any

01:02:59.394 --> 01:03:02.024
harm.
So, it was a very moderate

01:03:02.024 --> 01:03:05.722
conclusion.
What about real oligarchs,

01:03:05.722 --> 01:03:09.086
what about them?
Well, even they were taken care

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:12.504
of, the town of Eleusis which
they had seized for their own

01:03:12.504 --> 01:03:14.920
protection as things were going
badly,

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.410
they were allowed to stay there
after the settlement.

01:03:21.559 --> 01:03:26.276
Now, that left Thrasybulus and
his friends in control in

01:03:26.276 --> 01:03:30.822
Athens, and they immediately
reinstated the Democratic

01:03:30.822 --> 01:03:36.053
Constitution pretty much as it
had been before all of this had

01:03:36.053 --> 01:03:39.149
happened.
Briefly, in this period of

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:42.698
transition, citizenship was
limited to the top three

01:03:42.698 --> 01:03:46.660
Solonian classes,
but that quickly fell through

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:51.980
and really the full democracy
was restored in the year 401.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:56.471
In the same year the democrats
seized Eleusis and brought that

01:03:56.471 --> 01:04:00.727
back into Attica.
So, if you're there in the year

01:04:00.727 --> 01:04:05.245
400 Athens would seem to be
exactly as it had been

01:04:05.245 --> 01:04:10.500
internally before the defeat in
the Peloponnesian War.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:15.463
That newly restored
democracy behaved with

01:04:15.463 --> 01:04:19.391
remarkable moderation.
Aristotle in his

01:04:19.391 --> 01:04:23.475
Constitution of the
Athenians goes out of his

01:04:23.475 --> 01:04:27.320
way to praise this successor
Athenian Regime.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.179
They kept closely to the
amnesty;

01:04:30.179 --> 01:04:33.940
they did not in fact,
prosecute people that they

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:37.347
should not have done.
On the other hand,

01:04:37.347 --> 01:04:42.222
they and Aristotle praises this
too, because--I guess his

01:04:42.222 --> 01:04:46.750
sympathies are very close to
those of Theramenes,

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:51.550
to moderate oligarchy or what
Aristotle would call

01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:54.980
politeia,
moderate regime.

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:58.727
When Thrasybulus asked--this is
an amazing thing,

01:04:58.727 --> 01:05:03.489
when he asked that those people
who had served in his army,

01:05:03.489 --> 01:05:08.251
who had liberated Athens and
restored the democracy that

01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:12.320
these people be granted Athenian
citizenship,

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:18.553
the Athenian people voted "no."
To me that is one of the most

01:05:18.553 --> 01:05:22.791
striking evidences of how the
Greeks really felt about their

01:05:22.791 --> 01:05:26.670
polis because even in a
situation like that,

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:30.458
the idea of sharing citizenship
with anybody who was not,

01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:33.030
so to speak,
a member of the family,

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:36.891
was beyond what they would
contemplate, and even with

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:40.805
Thrasybulus, the great hero,
the great liberator,

01:05:40.805 --> 01:05:44.429
asking them to do it,
they said "no dice."

01:05:44.429 --> 01:05:49.570
They also repaid the debts that
the Thirty had accumulated.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:54.293
What they were doing of course
was trying to get things calm as

01:05:54.293 --> 01:05:57.570
fast as they could,
to achieve stability.

01:05:57.570 --> 01:06:00.830
It's a very rare thing.
Imagine--well,

01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:04.139
think of what the French did
when the war was over.

01:06:04.139 --> 01:06:06.862
They took their collaborators,
they tried them,

01:06:06.862 --> 01:06:09.290
and they killed them for the
most part.

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:14.031
That's what civilized people do.
I mean, look what they did in

01:06:14.031 --> 01:06:17.697
Rwanda, and other places like
that where different sides in a

01:06:17.697 --> 01:06:20.080
civil war simply butcher each
other.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:24.303
That's a very normal situation.
What the Athenians did was very

01:06:24.303 --> 01:06:26.263
abnormal.
It was evidence,

01:06:26.263 --> 01:06:29.382
I think in part,
of a great deal of wisdom on

01:06:29.382 --> 01:06:32.429
the part of the key leaders at
the time,

01:06:32.429 --> 01:06:37.566
and I think it also shows you
that Athens over the many years

01:06:37.566 --> 01:06:42.960
of its democracy had not had
sharp edges between the classes.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:47.182
I think there was a general
kind of good feeling that made

01:06:47.182 --> 01:06:51.331
that sort of mass execution
something that seemed foreign

01:06:51.331 --> 01:06:56.259
and too undesirable.
So, if we look at Athens in

01:06:56.259 --> 01:07:02.254
401, the democracy has been
completely restored and I'd like

01:07:02.254 --> 01:07:07.842
to draw my comments about this
to a close by focusing on

01:07:07.842 --> 01:07:11.764
Thrasybulus,
a man, who I think probably

01:07:11.764 --> 01:07:16.478
none of you had ever heard his
name when you came into this

01:07:16.478 --> 01:07:18.453
class.
You had heard of Pericles,

01:07:18.453 --> 01:07:20.078
you may have heard of
Themistocles,

01:07:20.078 --> 01:07:22.803
you heard lots of different
Athenians, but you never heard

01:07:22.803 --> 01:07:26.032
of Thrasybulus.
So, you might be surprised to

01:07:26.032 --> 01:07:29.089
hear the following.
Cornelius Nepos,

01:07:29.089 --> 01:07:33.091
a Roman historian of the first
century B.C.,

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:37.559
in writing lives of famous
Greeks and Romans,

01:07:37.559 --> 01:07:42.387
wrote the following about
Thrasybulus: "If excellence were

01:07:42.387 --> 01:07:46.659
to be weighed by itself,
apart from luck,

01:07:46.659 --> 01:07:52.610
I believe I would rank this man
first of all.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:56.433
This much is certain,
I put no one ahead of him in

01:07:56.433 --> 01:07:58.696
sense of honor,
steadfastness,

01:07:58.696 --> 01:08:02.130
greatness of soul,
and love of country."

01:08:02.130 --> 01:08:08.130
That isn't bad but it's not the
end.

01:08:08.130 --> 01:08:12.824
A few years before 180
A.D., Pausanias the great travel

01:08:12.824 --> 01:08:16.790
writer of antiquity,
wrote his guide to the famous

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:20.189
and historic places of ancient
Greece.

01:08:20.189 --> 01:08:24.687
In the section on Athens,
he described the graves of the

01:08:24.687 --> 01:08:29.675
heroes and men that lined the
roads outside the city beginning

01:08:29.675 --> 01:08:34.500
with the one leading to the
place known as The Academy.

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:39.213
Here's what Pausanias the
travel writer says,

01:08:39.213 --> 01:08:43.069
"The first is that of
Thrasybulus,

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:47.376
son of Lycus,
in every way the greatest of

01:08:47.376 --> 01:08:52.524
all famous Athenians,
whether they lived before or

01:08:52.524 --> 01:08:56.925
after him."
Think of all the names that are

01:08:56.925 --> 01:09:02.211
involved in that and maybe the
weight of Pausanias' general

01:09:02.211 --> 01:09:07.224
comparison is intensified by
something a little bit more

01:09:07.224 --> 01:09:11.079
specific,
because the next words in

01:09:11.079 --> 01:09:16.856
Pausanias' account are these:
"His is the first grave and

01:09:16.856 --> 01:09:20.569
after it comes that of
Pericles,"

01:09:20.569 --> 01:09:25.550
just in case you thought he
missed Pericles by mistake.

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:30.316
Now, that's extraordinary
and there's a great puzzle that

01:09:30.316 --> 01:09:34.210
I can't solve and probably never
can be solved.

01:09:34.210 --> 01:09:38.748
How could it be that these
fellows who lived centuries

01:09:38.748 --> 01:09:43.630
afterwards said these things
about Thrasybulus and we have

01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:47.899
never heard of him?
I mean barely heard of him.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:52.654
I mean, the best answer I can
give you is there must have been

01:09:52.654 --> 01:09:56.409
lost histories,
and we know there are of the

01:09:56.409 --> 01:10:01.788
period, and they must have given
Thrasybulus the kind of credit

01:10:01.788 --> 01:10:07.080
for his remarkable achievements
that don't show up in Xenophon

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.547
and Diodorus and the orators.
But we at last,

01:10:11.547 --> 01:10:16.404
and you have an obligation to
future generations,

01:10:16.404 --> 01:10:21.666
must not let the name of
Thrasybulus lie in obscurity

01:10:21.666 --> 01:10:25.456
again,
and just so that you don't

01:10:25.456 --> 01:10:31.425
forget him, remember he is the
only Greek I know whose name

01:10:31.425 --> 01:10:35.440
fits a Yale fight
song--Thrasybulus,

01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.440
Thrasybulus.

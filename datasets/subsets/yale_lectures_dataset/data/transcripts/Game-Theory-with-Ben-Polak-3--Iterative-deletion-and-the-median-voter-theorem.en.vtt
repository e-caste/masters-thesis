00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.526
Professor Ben Polak:
Last time we talked a lot about

00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:07.698
the idea--I didn't mention the
name but here's some jargon for

00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:10.922
you--we talked about the idea of
deleting dominated strategies:

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:13.382
looking at a game;
figuring out which strategies

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.600
are dominated;
deleting them;

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.483
looking at the game again;
looking at which strategies are

00:00:18.483 --> 00:00:20.360
now dominated;
deleting those;

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.768
and so on and so forth.
This process is called the

00:00:23.768 --> 00:00:27.270
"iterative deletion of dominated
strategies."

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.600
This is not a great title for
Barry's book.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.533
You need to do better than that
to get the two hundred and fifty

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:31.577
dollars.
This is a boring title,

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:33.301
but never mind.
Iterative Deletion of Dominated

00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:35.235
Strategies.
The idea is--It embodies the

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.271
idea of putting yourself in
someone else's shoes and trying

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:40.470
to figure out what they're going
to do,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.362
and then think about them
putting themselves in your

00:00:42.362 --> 00:00:44.070
shoes, figuring out what you're
going to do,

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.264
and so on and so forth.
Last time, we saw already,

00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:51.860
that this is a very powerful
idea, in that game last time.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.001
But we also saw it's a
dangerous idea to take too

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.634
literally: that sometimes this
can get you to over-think the

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:59.766
problem and actually,
as in that numbers game last

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.718
time, the best choice,
the winning choice,

00:01:02.718 --> 00:01:05.310
might not involve so many
rounds.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.204
We also saw in that numbers
game last time that in some

00:01:08.204 --> 00:01:10.079
games, but by no means all
games,

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.844
in some games this process
actually converges to a single

00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:17.086
choice.
In that numbers game it

00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:20.631
converged to 1.
So once again what this idea

00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:24.116
is--this idea is--you yourself
should not play a dominated

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:25.830
strategy.
Delete those.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.048
Delete those for everyone else,
because everyone else is not

00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:29.440
going to play a dominated
strategy.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.413
Delete those.
Look at the game with all those

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:35.927
dominated strategies deleted.
See if there are any strategies

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:38.160
that are now dominated.
Delete those.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.510
Look again, etc., etc.
I could write that all up.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.147
We saw it in practice last time.
It's probably just easier to

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:48.448
have the idea there.
One tip about this,

00:01:48.448 --> 00:01:52.840
try to identify all the
dominated strategies of all

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.530
players before you delete,
then delete.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.598
Then look again.
Try to identify all the

00:01:58.598 --> 00:02:00.629
dominated strategies of all
players again,

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:03.625
and then delete.
That process will prevent you

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:07.019
from getting into trouble.
So today, I want to be a little

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:08.451
bit less abstract,
if you like,

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:10.360
and I want to look at an
application.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.800
I want to look at a famous
application from politics.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.480
So we're going to look at a
model of politics.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.653
The idea is going to be this.
We're going to imagine that

00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:33.000
there are two candidates,
and what these candidates are

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.643
doing is they're choosing their
political positions for an

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:43.270
election.
So these are the players,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.919
and the strategies are going to
be - they're going to choose

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:57.660
positions on a spectrum,
on a political spectrum.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.772
To make life easy,
we're going to assume that this

00:03:00.772 --> 00:03:03.250
political spectrum has ten
positions.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.136
So here are the positions.
We'll call them 1,2,

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:17.530
3,4, 5,6, 7,8,
9, and 10.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.960
Very difficult.
What's the idea here?

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.140
We haven't finished describing
the game.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.581
What's the idea?
The idea is that these

00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:27.272
positions are left wing
positions and these positions

00:03:27.272 --> 00:03:30.271
are right wing positions.
(Can people not see past the

00:03:30.271 --> 00:03:33.331
podium?
Let's get it out of the way.)

00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:38.780
So you could think of these
extreme left wing positions.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.625
These are people who,
I guess, they don't eat

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:47.606
anything except for fruit and
they think that trees should

00:03:47.606 --> 00:03:49.883
have the vote.
These guys out here,

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:51.430
these are the extreme right
wing positions.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.289
So they think the poor
shouldn't have the vote and they

00:03:56.289 --> 00:04:00.077
eat immigrants.
I'm an immigrant:

00:04:00.077 --> 00:04:03.889
better be careful.
The candidates here are going

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:07.147
to try and choose positions.
We're going to assume--this is

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:10.951
not realistic--we're going to
assume for now that there are

00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:14.099
10% of the voters at each of
these positions.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:23.399
So there's 10% of the voters at
each position.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:26.389
So they are uniformly
distributed.

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.878
We're going to assume that
voters will eventually vote for

00:04:31.878 --> 00:04:38.061
the closest candidate.
So voters vote for the closest

00:04:38.061 --> 00:04:45.546
candidate: the candidate whose
position is closest to their

00:04:45.546 --> 00:04:47.834
own.
And we'll need a tiebreaking

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:50.110
assumption and we'll do the
obvious tiebreak.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.819
If there's a tie then the
voters split.

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.819
The voters of that position
split evenly.

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.900
If there's a tie,
half the voters at that

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.813
position go for one of the
candidates and half of them go

00:05:02.813 --> 00:05:04.704
for the other.
So here's a game,

00:05:04.704 --> 00:05:07.230
I've got the players,
that's the candidates.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.630
I've got the strategies,
that's the political positions.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.170
What am I missing?
I'm missing payoffs, right?

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.247
I'm missing payoffs.
It matters in this game a lot

00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:30.386
how we specify the payoffs but
we're going to assume that the

00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:39.677
payoffs are that the candidates
aim to maximize their share of

00:05:39.677 --> 00:05:42.657
the vote.
But that's not the only thing

00:05:42.657 --> 00:05:44.709
we could have assumed.
We could have assumed that all

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:47.194
they really care about is
winning and that winning gave

00:05:47.194 --> 00:05:49.769
them a high payoff and that
losing gave them nothing.

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:52.011
I'm going to assume a little
bit more and I'm going to assume

00:05:52.011 --> 00:05:53.579
that--I haven't spelled
maximized right,

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:57.310
max will do--they want to max
their share of the vote.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.992
The reason this isn't a
terrible assumption is you could

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.724
think that getting a higher
share of the vote gives you a

00:06:02.724 --> 00:06:04.635
mandate.
Or, if this is a primary

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:08.113
election, a larger share of the
vote gives you a bigger push for

00:06:08.113 --> 00:06:11.602
the next primary or whatever.
So we'll assume that they're

00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:14.310
trying to maximize their share
of the vote.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.480
So we want to know what's going
to happen in this game.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.129
It seems like a pretty natural,
pretty important game.

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.209
Okay, so given what we've
learned so far in the class,

00:06:25.209 --> 00:06:29.827
a natural first question to ask
is: are any of the strategies

00:06:29.827 --> 00:06:32.383
here?
There are ten strategies 1,2,

00:06:32.383 --> 00:06:35.274
3,4, 5,6, 7,8,
9,10, are any of the strategies

00:06:35.274 --> 00:06:37.079
dominated?
Are any strategies dominated?

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:39.579
Let's get some--Let me get my
microphones up and ready a

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:41.250
little bit.
So any strategies dominated?

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.520
How about this gentleman in
blue?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.738
So stand up and shout, yeah.
Student: Okay,

00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:49.115
1 and 10 are both dominated.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:06:49.115 --> 00:06:50.759
this gentleman whose name is?
Student: Steven.

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.850
Professor Ben Polak:
Steven says 1 and 10.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.290
We'll come back to 10.
You're right.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.518
We'll come back to 10.
So he says that position 1,

00:06:57.518 --> 00:07:02.026
strategy 1, choosing the most
extreme left wing position is a

00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:05.660
dominated strategy.
What dominates it by the way?

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.600
Steven, you want to shout it
out?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.319
Student: 2.
Professor Ben Polak: 2.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:16.126
So for example--So our
conjecture here is that 2

00:07:16.126 --> 00:07:22.439
dominates 1.
That's the claim.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:26.379
Let's just be careful here,
what does it mean to say that 2

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:30.426
dominates 1?
It means that choosing position

00:07:30.426 --> 00:07:36.121
2 always gives me a higher share
of the vote than choosing

00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:39.288
position 1,
no matter where the other

00:07:39.288 --> 00:07:45.940
candidate positions herself.
It does not mean 2 beats 1.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:58.069
So let's take Steven's
conjecture and see if it's true.

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:00.262
So, in particular,
let's start working out what

00:08:00.262 --> 00:08:03.264
share of the votes you'd get if
you chose position 1 or position

00:08:03.264 --> 00:08:07.094
2,
against different positions the

00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:11.642
other guy can choose.
So, for example,

00:08:11.642 --> 00:08:19.899
what we're going to do is we're
going to test does 2 dominate 1?

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:23.315
While we're doing this we'll
figure out how these payoffs

00:08:23.315 --> 00:08:27.490
work as well.
Well, how about versus 1.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.420
So suppose the other candidate
has chosen position 1.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.639
So the other candidate has
chosen position 1.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:37.436
Then we're going to compare my
payoff from choosing 1 against

00:08:37.436 --> 00:08:40.409
the other candidate's payoff
from choosing 1.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:45.016
We're going to compare this
with my payoff from choosing 2

00:08:45.016 --> 00:08:48.330
against the other candidate
choosing 1.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.254
Let's figure out what that is.
So what's my--somebody can

00:08:51.254 --> 00:08:55.258
shout this out--what's my share
of the vote if I choose 1 and

00:08:55.258 --> 00:08:58.020
the other candidate chooses 1?
50%.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.590
That was pretty easy, right?
It must be a tie for everybody,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.203
so I'll get 50% of the vote.
What's my share of the vote if

00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:09.460
I choose 2 and the other
candidate chooses 1?

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.920
90%.
He will get or she will get all

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.750
the voters at 1.
I'll get everyone else.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.502
So I get 90%.
So in this case choosing 2 is

00:09:18.502 --> 00:09:21.057
better than choosing 1.
But of course we're not done

00:09:21.057 --> 00:09:22.807
yet.
We have to consider other

00:09:22.807 --> 00:09:24.960
possible positions of my
opponent.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.000
So suppose my opponent chooses
2.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.951
So now we're comparing my
choosing 1, when my opponent

00:09:32.951 --> 00:09:38.371
chooses 2, and the payoff I
would get if I choose 2 when my

00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:43.594
opponent chooses 2.
So what's my payoff if I choose

00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:47.968
1 and my opponent chooses 2?
I get all the voters right on

00:09:47.968 --> 00:09:50.551
top of me at position 1 and she
gets everyone else,

00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:55.070
is that right?
So I get 10%.

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.150
And what about if we both
choose 2?

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.634
50%, everybody happy with that?
So 50% in this case,

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:04.750
and once again,
2 did better than 1.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:07.456
Everyone happy with that?
So we showed this choice was

00:10:07.456 --> 00:10:11.622
better and this choice was
better, and we're going to keep

00:10:11.622 --> 00:10:15.320
on going.
Against 3: so now we're

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:22.799
comparing my choosing 1 versus 3
and my choosing 2 versus 3.

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:27.515
If I choose 1 against 3,
what share of the vote do I

00:10:27.515 --> 00:10:30.935
get?
I'm going to get all the people

00:10:30.935 --> 00:10:36.297
at position 1 and half the
people at position 2 for a total

00:10:36.297 --> 00:10:40.575
of 15.
And if I chose 2 against 3,

00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:44.418
what do I get?
I get 20, I get all the people

00:10:44.418 --> 00:10:47.311
at 1 and I get all the people 2,
so I get 20%,

00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:51.180
so we're okay again.
Let's do one more just to see a

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.980
pattern here.
So if I choose 1 against 4,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.909
and comparing my choosing 2
against 4.

00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:03.395
In the former case if I choose
1 against 4, how many votes do I

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:06.029
get?
I get all the people at 1,

00:11:06.029 --> 00:11:10.260
and all the people at 2,
so I get 20% of the votes,

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.714
she gets everyone else.
And here if I choose 2 against

00:11:14.714 --> 00:11:18.398
4, I get all the people at 1,
all the people at 2,

00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:21.644
and what?
Half the people at 3,

00:11:21.644 --> 00:11:27.340
so that comes out as 25% and
once again and so on.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.972
Now, I could go on right the
way through here,

00:11:28.972 --> 00:11:31.184
but I'm going to stop because
it gets to be a bit boring after

00:11:31.184 --> 00:11:33.317
a while.
I'm guessing you can see a

00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:36.970
pattern emerging here.
What's the pattern here?

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:39.010
What's the pattern here?
Somebody?

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.120
Where's that?
Somebody raise their hand so we

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.852
can get a micke out there.
Can we get a mike on this guy

00:11:45.852 --> 00:11:49.141
in white?
Stand up, stand up,

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:53.120
yep, stand up and shout.
Student: 2 is always

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.243
better than 1.
Professor Ben Polak: 2

00:11:54.243 --> 00:11:55.584
is always better than 1,
but we can see more than that

00:11:55.584 --> 00:11:57.185
in the pattern.
That's right,

00:11:57.185 --> 00:12:02.019
but what's the pattern here?
Mike back here.

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:03.622
Student: Whatever's
closer to 5 is better than

00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:05.420
whatever's farther away from 5.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.750
That's not quite the pattern I'm
looking for.

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.099
Let's look at the numbers here.
We had 15,20,

00:12:09.099 --> 00:12:13.250
then this one,
up to 20,25 and so on.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:20.049
So what's the pattern here?
Yes, Steven again.

00:12:20.049 --> 00:12:22.423
Student: If your
opponent doesn't choose 1 or 2,

00:12:22.423 --> 00:12:25.016
then you're always going to be
5% better off if you choose 2

00:12:25.016 --> 00:12:26.538
than 1.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:12:26.538 --> 00:12:28.923
Exactly, so ignoring these first
two positions which were a bit

00:12:28.923 --> 00:12:30.922
weird,
choosing 2 always gave me 5%

00:12:30.922 --> 00:12:34.167
more votes than choosing 1,
regardless of what the other

00:12:34.167 --> 00:12:36.273
person chooses.
So I mean if you want,

00:12:36.273 --> 00:12:38.693
you can fill in the
next--whatever it is--the next 6

00:12:38.693 --> 00:12:41.011
positions and see.
But you'll see that very

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:44.260
clearly that Steven's right:
that choosing 2 will always get

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:47.620
me 5% more of the votes than
choosing 1 from here on down.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.569
And in fact,
they'll go up in intervals of

00:12:49.569 --> 00:12:51.120
5.
So, in fact,

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:57.466
it is true, it is in fact true,
so we can conclude that 2

00:12:57.466 --> 00:13:03.543
dominates--in fact,
we can do a bit better than

00:13:03.543 --> 00:13:08.720
that--we can say strictly
dominates 1.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:14.303
2 strictly dominates 1.
Is anything else dominated

00:13:14.303 --> 00:13:16.919
here, Steven already told us
that 10 is dominated.

00:13:16.919 --> 00:13:17.879
I'm not going to go through
that argument.

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:19.620
Can everyone see that is
symmetric?

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.251
Hang on a second,
everyone see that 10 is going

00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:24.940
to be dominated by 9 in exactly
the same way?

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.762
Is that obvious?
It's just really the same

00:13:26.762 --> 00:13:28.429
argument coming in the other
direction.

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:39.389
So similarly,
9 strictly dominates 10.

00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:44.858
And again, we're not saying
choosing 2 beats choosing 1,2

00:13:44.858 --> 00:13:48.570
wins against 1 or 9 wins against
10.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.317
Wwe're saying choosing 2 always
does better than choosing 1,

00:13:52.317 --> 00:13:55.240
regardless of what the other
person chooses.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.852
Choosing 9 always is better
than choosing 10 regardless of

00:13:58.852 --> 00:14:02.627
what the other person chooses.
There was a question,

00:14:02.627 --> 00:14:05.976
are we okay?
You want to get the mike in for

00:14:05.976 --> 00:14:09.309
the question?
Stand and shout out to everyone.

00:14:09.309 --> 00:14:11.636
Student: I think you may
have defined it already,

00:14:11.636 --> 00:14:13.750
but I couldn't find a
definition of strictly in the

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.138
book we have.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:14:15.138 --> 00:14:16.129
Okay, well you have one on the
handout.

00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:18.910
I think there probably is one
in there somewhere,

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.344
but just in case,
we have had two in class,

00:14:21.344 --> 00:14:26.440
there's one on the handout.
All right we've concluded that

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.610
1 is dominated by 2,
and 10 is dominated by 9.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:43.875
Is anything else dominated here?
Well what about thinking about

00:14:43.875 --> 00:14:55.233
whether 2 is dominated by 3,
after all--I've forgotten your

00:14:55.233 --> 00:15:02.720
name--what's your name there?
Yes?

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.461
Student: Sudiptha.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:06.600
Sudiptha had suggested earlier
on, you want to be close to 5.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:17.450
So 3 is closer to 5 than 2.
Is 2 dominated by 3?

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.170
Anyone else?
Any other hands?

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:24.590
There's a hand here.
Can you get this lady here?

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.965
Student: Once you delete
the dominated strategies,

00:15:26.965 --> 00:15:29.595
then you kind of go through it
again and then 2 is dominated by

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:30.505
3.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:15:30.505 --> 00:15:31.549
Good, so you're getting ahead of
us, good.

00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:34.320
So we'll get there,
hold that thought.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.870
But what about right now before
we delete anything?

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.769
So let's check it out.
Let's check it out.

00:15:40.769 --> 00:15:43.460
So, in particular,
let's just try this process.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:48.220
So how about my payoff versus
1, for example.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:16:01.263
So 2 against 1 gives me 90% of
the votes, 3 against 1 gives me

00:16:01.263 --> 00:16:06.335
what?
85% of the votes which is

00:16:06.335 --> 00:16:11.342
actually lower,
so it's clear that 3

00:16:11.342 --> 00:16:16.245
doesn't dominate 2.
In particular,

00:16:16.245 --> 00:16:18.836
if the other candidate were to
choose position 1,

00:16:18.836 --> 00:16:22.128
I would get a higher share of
the vote choosing 2 than I would

00:16:22.128 --> 00:16:25.058
have done if I had chosen 3.
So, in fact,

00:16:25.058 --> 00:16:29.269
it's not the case that 2 is
dominated by 3.

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:33.190
But the woman who's name I
either didn't get or forgot.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:34.383
Student: Christine.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:16:34.383 --> 00:16:35.090
Christine has pointed something
out.

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:37.042
So Christine,
why don't you wait for the mike

00:16:37.042 --> 00:16:39.423
and point that out again.
So we know that 2 is not

00:16:39.423 --> 00:16:41.692
dominated, and particularly not
dominated by 3,

00:16:41.692 --> 00:16:43.320
but …
what's the "but"?

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.855
Student: When you delete
the dominated strategy of 2

00:16:46.855 --> 00:16:48.927
dominating 1,
or 1 being dominated,

00:16:48.927 --> 00:16:51.610
when you delete that and 10,
then it is.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.898
Professor Ben Polak: So
what Christine is arguing is,

00:16:54.898 --> 00:16:58.409
even though it's the case that
2 is not a dominated strategy,

00:16:58.409 --> 00:17:01.176
if we do the process of
iterative deletion of dominated

00:17:01.176 --> 00:17:03.840
strategies and we delete the
dominated strategies,

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:08.079
then maybe we should look again
and see if it's dominated now.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:11.307
So let's be careful here,
we're not saying that we're

00:17:11.307 --> 00:17:14.907
going to delete the voters at 1,
or delete the voters at 10

00:17:14.907 --> 00:17:18.595
(though we might wish to).
We're just saying we want--What

00:17:18.595 --> 00:17:21.128
we're saying is,
we know that the candidates

00:17:21.128 --> 00:17:24.427
aren't going to position
themselves at 1 and aren't going

00:17:24.427 --> 00:17:28.125
to position themselves at 10.
So in some sense we're deleting

00:17:28.125 --> 00:17:32.770
those strategies.
The voters are still there.

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:42.646
So let's try that.
So if we--there's a but here I

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:51.441
guess--if we delete the
strategies 1 and 10,

00:17:51.441 --> 00:18:01.260
which were dominated,
then does 3 dominate 2?

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:08.670
Once again, we can try it out.
So let's try it out.

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:16.380
So the payoff from choosing 1,
let's start against 2.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:22.859
So the payoff from choosing 2
against 2 is 50%.

00:18:22.859 --> 00:18:30.839
The payoff from choosing 3
against 2 is what?

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:32.210
What's the payoff from choosing
3?

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.862
Someone can shout out.
What's the payoff from choosing

00:18:34.862 --> 00:18:37.347
3 against 2?
80%: the person at 2 is going

00:18:37.347 --> 00:18:39.760
to get all the ones at 1,
and all the ones at 2;

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:46.349
and 3 will get everything else.
So this is 80% versus 3.

00:18:46.349 --> 00:18:51.780
The payoff of 2 against 3 is
all the people at 1,

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.740
all the people at 2,
so it's 20%.

00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:01.600
The payoff from choosing 3
against 3, is of course 50%,

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:06.829
so, so far so good.
So far choosing 3 is better.

00:19:06.829 --> 00:19:13.609
Against 4, the payoff from
choosing 2 against 4 is what?

00:19:13.609 --> 00:19:16.930
What's the payoff from choosing
2 against 4?

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:21.165
Again, all the people at 1,
all the people at 2,

00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:24.950
and half the people at 3,
so that's 25%.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:29.078
The payoff from choosing 3
against 4 is going to be all the

00:19:29.078 --> 00:19:31.569
people at 1, all the people at
2,

00:19:31.569 --> 00:19:35.491
and all the people at 3,
for a total of 30%,

00:19:35.491 --> 00:19:39.660
which again is bigger.
Let's do one more.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:46.669
Versus 5, the payoff from
choosing 2--(I can afford to

00:19:46.669 --> 00:19:53.339
raise this a bit)--against 5,
is all the people at 1,

00:19:53.339 --> 00:19:58.480
all the people at 2,
and all the people at 3;

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.772
30%.
Whereas the payoff from

00:20:01.772 --> 00:20:06.393
choosing 3 against 5 is all the
people at 1, all the people at

00:20:06.393 --> 00:20:10.559
2, all the people at 3 and half
the people at 4,35%.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:12.743
And again, you can see exactly
the same pattern is going to

00:20:12.743 --> 00:20:14.404
emerge here.
From here on down,

00:20:14.404 --> 00:20:17.429
if I bothered to do it,
we'd find that choosing 3

00:20:17.429 --> 00:20:21.211
always gets me 5% more of the
vote than I would have had from

00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:23.712
choosing 2,
against any of these higher

00:20:23.712 --> 00:20:25.471
numbers.
The same pattern Steven pointed

00:20:25.471 --> 00:20:27.274
out before.
So, I've forgotten your name

00:20:27.274 --> 00:20:28.750
again, I'm sorry.
Student: Christine.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:33.177
Professor Ben Polak: So
Christine is correct in saying

00:20:33.177 --> 00:20:36.940
that once we delete the
strategies 1 and 10--once we

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.440
realize that those positions are
not going to be chosen by our

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.425
sophisticated candidates--then
we realize that probably

00:20:45.425 --> 00:20:50.000
choosing 2 (and of course 9)
isn't a good idea either.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:06.763
So 2 and 9 are not dominated
but they are dominated once we

00:21:06.763 --> 00:21:22.660
realize 1 and 10 won't be
played, or won't be chosen.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.480
Okay, so where are we going
here?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.739
Where are we going?
Where is this discussion going

00:21:28.739 --> 00:21:32.422
to end up?
Let's come back to our original

00:21:32.422 --> 00:21:34.374
game.
We've argued that 1 and 10

00:21:34.374 --> 00:21:36.950
shouldn't be chosen because
they're dominated.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.730
We've argued that once we
realize those aren't going to be

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.119
played, that 2 and 9 aren't
going to be played.

00:21:42.119 --> 00:21:47.190
What's going to end up being
played?

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.484
Well let's just go slower.
So we were able to dominate 1

00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:51.562
and 10 in the first round,
so we know this won't be

00:21:51.562 --> 00:21:53.390
played, and we know this won't
be played.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.130
And remember the voters are
still there: we're just deleting

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.526
the strategies.
Then we dominated–Then we

00:21:58.526 --> 00:22:01.273
ruled out--(I'll put double
crosses for "in the second

00:22:01.273 --> 00:22:05.721
round")--2 and 9.
Then we ruled out 3 and 8,

00:22:05.721 --> 00:22:12.545
and then we ruled out,
we would have done 4 and 7 and

00:22:12.545 --> 00:22:18.104
that leaves just 5 and 6.
So if we do the procedure of

00:22:18.104 --> 00:22:22.210
iteratively deleting dominated
strategies, going back again,

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.115
looking what's dominated,
doing it again,

00:22:24.115 --> 00:22:26.640
doing it again …
all that's left is 5 and 6.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.989
So this procedure leads us to
conclude that the candidates

00:22:29.989 --> 00:22:32.804
will choose positions 5 and 6.
Does 5 dominate 6,

00:22:32.804 --> 00:22:34.880
or 6 dominate 5,
or anything like that?

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.589
No, at that point it's just a
tie, right?

00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:42.465
So in the end,
the procedure,

00:22:42.465 --> 00:22:55.265
so iterative deletion--(let's
write "it del")--leads to

00:22:55.265 --> 00:23:02.928
deleting all except 5 and 6.
So this was just a simple

00:23:02.928 --> 00:23:04.639
exercise, I think.
I mean I'm hoping that was a

00:23:04.639 --> 00:23:06.648
simple exercise.
Let me just look out there,

00:23:06.648 --> 00:23:08.369
is everyone following that
okay?

00:23:08.369 --> 00:23:11.854
That really wasn't meant to be
hard, but what's relevant about

00:23:11.854 --> 00:23:14.540
this exercise is not the fact
that it's hard.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.795
In fact, it isn't hard.
What's relevant is the fact

00:23:16.795 --> 00:23:19.240
that it's relevant.
It's about the real world.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.494
In particular,
this is a famous model in

00:23:21.494 --> 00:23:24.794
political science.
Anyone know the name of this

00:23:24.794 --> 00:23:26.490
model?
What's the prediction here?

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.811
The prediction here is that the
candidates are going to be

00:23:29.811 --> 00:23:32.877
squeezed towards the middle.
They're going to choose

00:23:32.877 --> 00:23:36.027
positions very close to each
other and very close to the

00:23:36.027 --> 00:23:37.180
center.
What's that called?

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:42.770
Anyone know?
Hold the thought on that.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.000
Someone at the back, shout out.
This is the "Median Voter

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.930
Theorem";
thank you.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:54.420
So let's have a new board,
this one will do fine.

00:23:54.420 --> 00:24:06.794
So the prediction is candidates
crowd the center and this is

00:24:06.794 --> 00:24:18.750
called, in Political Science,
the Median Voter Theorem.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.519
It's called the Median Voter
Theorem because the voters at

00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:23.220
the center, in this case 5 and
6,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.847
actually get to decide not just
the election,

00:24:26.847 --> 00:24:31.630
but to decide therefore,
what policies are put in place.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:36.720
How does this do as a
prediction of the real world?

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.911
Well there are examples in
American History in which the

00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:42.290
Median Voter Theorem looks
pretty good.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.068
They're pretty old examples.
They're going to be before you

00:24:45.068 --> 00:24:46.650
guys were born,
but let me mention them anyway.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:50.403
So I think a lot of people--if
you go back today and you look

00:24:50.403 --> 00:24:54.156
at tapes of the Kennedy Nixon
Election in 1960 (some American

00:24:54.156 --> 00:24:57.490
help me out here,
'60 right?)--I think it was '60.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.729
So in the 1960's actually,
between Kennedy and Nixon,

00:24:59.729 --> 00:25:01.710
if you ever go over and look at
those tapes,

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.937
it's amazing how conservative
Kennedy looks when you think

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:08.421
about his reputation today.
They really were crowding the

00:25:08.421 --> 00:25:10.070
center.
And eight years later Nixon

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.549
seemed to have learned his
lesson.

00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:13.886
If you look at the '68
election, which Nixon won,

00:25:13.886 --> 00:25:15.979
Nixon sounds,
on those tapes of his policies

00:25:15.979 --> 00:25:17.779
being put forth in that
election,

00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:21.619
he looks extremely liberal for
a Republican.

00:25:21.619 --> 00:25:24.190
So again, they were crowding
that center space.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.950
Some people argue that that's
exactly what Clinton did in '92.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.605
He took the Democratic Party to
the right, i.e.,

00:25:30.605 --> 00:25:34.108
towards the center in order to
pick up those central voters and

00:25:34.108 --> 00:25:36.135
win.
So there are examples in

00:25:36.135 --> 00:25:39.747
American History of elections
that seem to--in which the

00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:42.440
Median Voter Theorem seems to do
well.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.078
We'll come back and discuss it
more in a second,

00:25:45.078 --> 00:25:47.548
but before I do,
let me mention that the same

00:25:47.548 --> 00:25:49.741
model,
exactly the same idea,

00:25:49.741 --> 00:25:52.190
has an application in
Economics.

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.880
Somebody mentioned it already
over there.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.227
The application in Economics is
to do with product placement,

00:25:57.227 --> 00:25:59.180
something that Jake's working
on.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.013
In product placement,
you might think when you're

00:26:02.013 --> 00:26:04.905
placing a gas station,
you might think it would be

00:26:04.905 --> 00:26:08.269
nice if gas stations spread
themselves evenly out over the

00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:11.869
town or out over the road So
wherever you happen to be,

00:26:11.869 --> 00:26:14.188
when you run out gas,
there was a gas station close

00:26:14.188 --> 00:26:15.690
by.
That would be convenient.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.152
But unfortunately,
gas stations,

00:26:17.152 --> 00:26:19.132
as we all know,
they tend to crowd into the

00:26:19.132 --> 00:26:21.019
same corners,
they tend to be on the same

00:26:21.019 --> 00:26:22.340
road junctions,
right?

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.928
Why?
Because they're trying to,

00:26:23.928 --> 00:26:26.250
they're competing for voters
who happen to be close,

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.705
or running out of gas at those
moments, and by crowding

00:26:29.705 --> 00:26:33.546
together they avoid being out
competed by each other in terms

00:26:33.546 --> 00:26:36.041
of position.
I said that a bit quickly,

00:26:36.041 --> 00:26:39.494
but we'll come back and look at
that idea in more detail later

00:26:39.494 --> 00:26:41.495
on in the class.
So in politics,

00:26:41.495 --> 00:26:44.887
this is about candidates
crowding close together towards

00:26:44.887 --> 00:26:48.403
the center, to try and get as
many voters who are close to

00:26:48.403 --> 00:26:50.393
them.
And in Economics,

00:26:50.393 --> 00:26:55.320
this is about firm's crowding
together to try and get shoppers

00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.103
who are close to them.
The people associated with this

00:27:00.103 --> 00:27:05.095
are a guy called Anthony Downs,
who did this in Political

00:27:05.095 --> 00:27:09.624
Science, in a book in 1957.
And in Economics,

00:27:09.624 --> 00:27:15.517
a guy called Hotelling,
who wrote a paper about this in

00:27:15.517 --> 00:27:17.873
1929.
In Political Science,

00:27:17.873 --> 00:27:20.769
they call this "simultaneous
discovery."

00:27:20.769 --> 00:27:26.099
I think 1929 is a bit earlier,
but never mind.

00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:27.678
Now, what I want to do now,
what I want to is,

00:27:27.678 --> 00:27:29.677
periodically in the class and
we have a model up there and

00:27:29.677 --> 00:27:31.980
we've got to analyze it.
We've used a bit of Game Theory

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.086
to analyze it.
I want us to talk about whether

00:27:34.086 --> 00:27:36.580
we think it's right.
What do we think of the

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.190
strengths and weaknesses of this
model?

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.137
So what I want you to start
thinking about is:

00:27:41.137 --> 00:27:43.242
do you believe this model?
Is this a good model of

00:27:43.242 --> 00:27:46.849
politics?
What's it missing?

00:27:46.849 --> 00:27:49.332
Let me come off the stage a
second, so I can encourage you

00:27:49.332 --> 00:27:50.900
to get involved in the
discussion.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.019
How many of you are Poly Sci
majors?

00:27:54.019 --> 00:27:56.900
Raise your hands you Poly Sci
majors.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.795
By the way, how many of you are
Poly Sci majors who have seen

00:27:59.795 --> 00:28:03.230
this model before?
Some of you have seen it before.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:06.720
So what's this model missing?
You all live in America.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.355
You all live in a democracy.
You don't all live in America,

00:28:09.355 --> 00:28:10.819
but a lot of you live in a
democracy.

00:28:10.819 --> 00:28:12.120
Do you have some idea about
this?

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.876
So what are we missing here?
So can we get the woman here

00:28:17.876 --> 00:28:20.525
Ale?
Student: The voters are

00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:22.990
not evenly distributed 10%,
10%, 10%.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.766
Professor Ben Polak: So
one thing that seems odd about

00:28:25.766 --> 00:28:28.589
the way we set up this model is
that the voters are not evenly

00:28:28.589 --> 00:28:31.092
distributed.
Let me go and put that

00:28:31.092 --> 00:28:35.259
up--it'll be tiring but let me
go to and fro a bit.

00:28:35.259 --> 00:28:41.545
So one thing that's missing,
or wrong if you like,

00:28:41.545 --> 00:28:49.242
but the one thing is the voters
are not evenly distributed in

00:28:49.242 --> 00:28:52.789
the real world.
Good, anything else?

00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:55.590
Good we'll talk about each of
these in turn.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:00.703
Can I get the guy over here?
Sorry I'm not making this easy

00:29:00.703 --> 00:29:02.710
for Jude, let me just stay down
here.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:05.089
I'll collect a few and then go
back to the board.

00:29:05.089 --> 00:29:07.410
Student: The model
doesn't take into account

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.590
differences between the groups
in voter turnout,

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:11.911
based on the candidates.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:29:11.911 --> 00:29:13.349
Good, so there's an issue of
turnout.

00:29:13.349 --> 00:29:16.529
We assumed here that everyone
votes, is that right?

00:29:16.529 --> 00:29:18.194
But in fact,
not everyone votes,

00:29:18.194 --> 00:29:20.450
there's always the option of
not voting.

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.059
Remind me to put that one up,
"not voting," you'll have to

00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:28.396
remind me of these.
How about the gentleman here in

00:29:28.396 --> 00:29:30.502
the yellow.
Student: There's a

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:32.500
difference between the primary
and general election.

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.671
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so we assumed,

00:29:34.671 --> 00:29:37.305
we kind of jumped to just one
election and at least in the

00:29:37.305 --> 00:29:39.589
American system,
for better or for worse--I

00:29:39.589 --> 00:29:42.465
could voice an opinion on
that--there are lots of little

00:29:42.465 --> 00:29:45.014
elections on the way.
There are primaries in all

00:29:45.014 --> 00:29:47.751
these states that you never,
you probably have heard of,

00:29:47.751 --> 00:29:50.290
states you probably have heard
of along the way.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.446
Anything else?
Can we get the--Where's the

00:29:54.446 --> 00:30:00.722
other mike?
Can we get the woman in green

00:30:00.722 --> 00:30:03.256
here?
Student: American voters

00:30:03.256 --> 00:30:05.549
often vote based on character
rather than position.

00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:07.922
Professor Ben Polak: So
there's more than just

00:30:07.922 --> 00:30:09.870
positions.
Another way of saying that,

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.515
stop me if this is wrong,
but one way to say that is

00:30:12.515 --> 00:30:15.420
we've been assuming that
politics is one dimensional,

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.243
left/right and there might be
other things involved:

00:30:18.243 --> 00:30:21.429
character or even among issues,
even among political issues it

00:30:21.429 --> 00:30:22.970
could be more than one
dimension.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.831
It could be that there's a
dimension about the environment

00:30:25.831 --> 00:30:27.789
and a dimension about foreign
policy,

00:30:27.789 --> 00:30:31.380
and maybe another dimension
about redistributive politics.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:38.844
So that's an important idea.
Let me get a couple more,

00:30:38.844 --> 00:30:42.835
can we get?
Student: The model might

00:30:42.835 --> 00:30:45.660
not apply with more than two
candidates.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.041
Professor Ben Polak: So
another issue here is,

00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:50.240
I just assumed that there were
two candidates.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:52.940
We know in some elections there
was third candidate.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.062
For example,
there was Nader in the election

00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:58.072
in--well I guess he was there in
the other one as well--but he

00:30:58.072 --> 00:31:00.680
was particularly there in 2000.
So, by the way,

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:04.085
I don't mean this as a joke,
in some sense there's always a

00:31:04.085 --> 00:31:07.960
third candidate and that comes
from the problem we had earlier,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.690
because not voting is always an
option.

00:31:10.690 --> 00:31:12.455
So in principle,
in that election in 2000,

00:31:12.455 --> 00:31:14.435
there was at least four
candidates, as it were,

00:31:14.435 --> 00:31:16.329
four things you could do with
your vote.

00:31:16.329 --> 00:31:19.205
You could vote for,
as it was in that time,

00:31:19.205 --> 00:31:22.423
Gore, Bush, Nader,
or not voting--and I'll leave

00:31:22.423 --> 00:31:26.119
it to you to decide which of
those is equivalent to not

00:31:26.119 --> 00:31:28.119
voting.
Anyone else?

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:32.045
One other thing I think that's
really, maybe it's a small

00:31:32.045 --> 00:31:35.269
thing, there's one other glaring
thing here.

00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:37.900
Someone we haven't had yet,
Ale help me out here.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.720
Let me get this guy here.
Student: Extrapolating

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.883
from the fact that there are
different things which people

00:31:43.883 --> 00:31:46.370
take into account,
not everyone closest to 6 might

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:48.880
actually vote for 6,
it might be coincidence.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.378
Professor Ben Polak:
That's true, although that may

00:31:51.378 --> 00:31:53.820
be a question of dimension.
I had a different thing in mind.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.299
Let me say it.
So I think this is important.

00:31:57.299 --> 00:32:02.537
A candidate could say during an
election that "I'm a moderate

00:32:02.537 --> 00:32:07.861
candidate, I'm at position 5"
but you might not believe him or

00:32:07.861 --> 00:32:10.601
her.
You've got the candidates track

00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:14.157
record, unless that candidate
can commit to policies at

00:32:14.157 --> 00:32:16.942
position 5,
you might know full well that

00:32:16.942 --> 00:32:20.345
the candidate is in fact a
position 10 or a position 1

00:32:20.345 --> 00:32:22.579
candidate,
is that right?

00:32:22.579 --> 00:32:25.653
So unless the candidate can
actually commit to a position,

00:32:25.653 --> 00:32:28.242
there may be a problem in them
simply announcing,

00:32:28.242 --> 00:32:31.626
"my position is moderate."
So again, let's think of an

00:32:31.626 --> 00:32:33.852
example here,
a couple of examples,

00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:37.396
in the Bush Gore election,
we saw President Bush,

00:32:37.396 --> 00:32:41.137
candidate Bush as was,
saying "I'm not a right wing

00:32:41.137 --> 00:32:43.244
candidate,
I'm a compassionate

00:32:43.244 --> 00:32:46.880
conservative."
And you guys believed him.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.926
I don't know,
maybe he was,

00:32:47.926 --> 00:32:49.540
I don't know.
His track record in Texas

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.319
probably did actually look a lot
like that.

00:32:51.319 --> 00:32:53.890
Or today, if you look at both
primaries going on now,

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:56.015
you're seeing various
candidates on both the

00:32:56.015 --> 00:32:58.190
Republican side and the
Democratic side,

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:01.755
seek to position themselves.
But as you all know,

00:33:01.755 --> 00:33:04.274
those candidates almost all
have track records,

00:33:04.274 --> 00:33:06.630
and not everybody believes that
Clinton,

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.594
that Hilary Clinton,
is quite so centrist as she now

00:33:09.594 --> 00:33:11.436
seems.
And not everyone believes that

00:33:11.436 --> 00:33:13.592
the former Governor of
Massachusetts is quite so

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:17.433
conservative as he now seems.
So it's not clear that you can

00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:20.520
just choose your position willy
nilly.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.471
So let's put some of these up.
So I'm going to forget

00:33:24.471 --> 00:33:26.460
remember, so you're going to
have to help me out a bit.

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:34.490
So we have many candidates,
more than just two;

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:38.460
or we have not voting,
which is related to that

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.281
actually;
and we have choosing your

00:33:41.281 --> 00:33:44.950
position, the inability to
commit to a position.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:52.554
So your position may be not
believed, and I want to claim

00:33:52.554 --> 00:33:59.886
that that's connected to the
idea that you can't commit

00:33:59.886 --> 00:34:05.030
yourself to your policies.
We had some others.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:14.068
We had primaries;
and we had other dimensions,

00:34:14.068 --> 00:34:21.360
so we had higher dimensions.
Have I got the main ones now?

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.610
I think I got most of the main
ones.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.953
So there's lots of things--when
we look at this model--there's

00:34:25.953 --> 00:34:30.734
lots of things that are missing.
A lot of things are not seeming

00:34:30.734 --> 00:34:35.041
to be captured by it.
And here's where I want to get

00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:37.619
a little bit more religious,
if you like.

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:39.909
It's tempting to say,
look, we wrote up this model.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:44.200
It's missing all this stuff,
so it must be useless.

00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:47.101
You know we shouldn't model it.
You might even go further,

00:34:47.101 --> 00:34:50.464
you might say modeling it is
always going to miss stuff out,

00:34:50.464 --> 00:34:52.985
so let's just not bother.
That, I think,

00:34:52.985 --> 00:34:56.478
is the wrong conclusion here.
The right conclusion,

00:34:56.478 --> 00:34:59.496
I think, is:
the reason we write down these

00:34:59.496 --> 00:35:03.519
models is to try and capture and
test our intuitions.

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:05.996
In this case,
the intuition about crowding

00:35:05.996 --> 00:35:08.991
towards the center to get votes.
But, of course,

00:35:08.991 --> 00:35:12.632
these models abstract from very
important parts of reality,

00:35:12.632 --> 00:35:14.829
and the next step to do is
what?

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:18.623
Is to say, okay now let's try
to enrich the model,

00:35:18.623 --> 00:35:23.036
to add more into the model,
and see if you get a different

00:35:23.036 --> 00:35:26.432
result, and if so why?
So you start with your basic

00:35:26.432 --> 00:35:28.603
model, then you add in,
you enrich the model,

00:35:28.603 --> 00:35:30.429
and you see if the results
change,

00:35:30.429 --> 00:35:33.656
and that'll help you explain
why you're getting different

00:35:33.656 --> 00:35:37.469
results in different settings.
So the sort of religious part

00:35:37.469 --> 00:35:41.000
of today's class is models are
always abstractions.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.419
You want to use them to see
what's missing,

00:35:43.419 --> 00:35:46.241
and then add things back in,
to see if they make a

00:35:46.241 --> 00:35:49.563
difference, and if so how.
Let's go through these a little

00:35:49.563 --> 00:35:51.477
bit.
So it turns out that the very

00:35:51.477 --> 00:35:55.021
first one, voters are not evenly
distributed is certainly true,

00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:57.883
it's undoubtedly true.
But it turns out that if you

00:35:57.883 --> 00:36:00.340
make the voters distributed more
realistically,

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.853
let's say like on a bell-curve
shape, it makes actually no

00:36:03.853 --> 00:36:06.958
difference to the result at all.
So this is true,

00:36:06.958 --> 00:36:09.670
but it doesn't actually change
the result.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:15.559
So on this one we're okay.
The result survives this change.

00:36:15.559 --> 00:36:18.200
What about the one about many
candidates?

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.510
Well clearly that matters a lot.
We know that there were many

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:24.369
candidates in the '92 election
and the 2000 election,

00:36:24.369 --> 00:36:26.900
and we know that "not voting"
is important.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.789
So this one I'm going to let
you see whether it makes

00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:32.114
a difference.
This one's going to be on the

00:36:32.114 --> 00:36:34.198
problem set.
So I'm actually going to get

00:36:34.198 --> 00:36:36.105
you to do this.
Let's go back to the model,

00:36:36.105 --> 00:36:38.730
add in an extra candidate,
and see what happens.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.970
You can learn whether it makes
a difference.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:43.139
I'm not going to give it away.
The one about committing to

00:36:43.139 --> 00:36:46.242
policy: this is important.
It's really hard for candidates

00:36:46.242 --> 00:36:48.573
to convince you,
that they really are a left,

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:50.639
or a right, or a centrist
candidate.

00:36:50.639 --> 00:36:53.704
Let me give you a historical
example outside of America,

00:36:53.704 --> 00:36:55.710
but in the real world,
in England.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:00.621
In the '97--In the 80's and
90's, the Labor Party in England

00:37:00.621 --> 00:37:03.368
had lost election,
after election,

00:37:03.368 --> 00:37:05.926
after election.
And in each election,

00:37:05.926 --> 00:37:08.578
they would come forward and
say, "we are not really a left

00:37:08.578 --> 00:37:11.060
wing party,
we're a centrist party these

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.329
days" And people would say,
we don't believe you.

00:37:14.329 --> 00:37:17.083
So what Tony Blair,
the guy who won the '97

00:37:17.083 --> 00:37:21.083
election, did with "New Labor
policy was: he managed to commit

00:37:21.083 --> 00:37:24.690
to a centrist policy by
literally committing to it.

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.557
He took the--In England you
have to publish your economic

00:37:27.557 --> 00:37:30.630
and financial plans of the
Government five years in ahead.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.305
So he took the financial plans
of the conservative Government

00:37:33.305 --> 00:37:35.238
that was then in power,
five years ahead,

00:37:35.238 --> 00:37:37.162
and he said these are my
financial plans,

00:37:37.162 --> 00:37:40.001
I'm going to announce these
today as my financial plans five

00:37:40.001 --> 00:37:42.117
years ahead.
They're exactly the same

00:37:42.117 --> 00:37:44.550
policies as the Conservative
Government has.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:47.111
So not only was he choosing a
position close to the

00:37:47.111 --> 00:37:49.314
Conservatives:
he was choosing exactly their

00:37:49.314 --> 00:37:51.105
position.
And it came down to what

00:37:51.105 --> 00:37:53.589
somebody else said here:
that left the election on the

00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:55.793
other dimension,
which might have been character

00:37:55.793 --> 00:37:57.360
or whatever.
That won;

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.807
that won by a big way.
So nevertheless,

00:37:59.807 --> 00:38:01.966
even having given you that
historical example,

00:38:01.966 --> 00:38:04.845
we're going to come back and
we'll look later on in the class

00:38:04.845 --> 00:38:08.059
at a model in which politicians
cannot choose their positions,

00:38:08.059 --> 00:38:09.958
but, rather,
you know their positions ahead

00:38:09.958 --> 00:38:11.920
of time.
So we'll do this one.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:14.945
We'll do this one later.
These other two,

00:38:14.945 --> 00:38:17.649
primaries and higher
dimensions, they're both great

00:38:17.649 --> 00:38:19.672
points.
We're not going to have time to

00:38:19.672 --> 00:38:22.207
do them in this course,
but if you take a class in the

00:38:22.207 --> 00:38:25.030
Political Science department on
voting and on elections,

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:27.818
on modeling elections,
you will see that both of these

00:38:27.818 --> 00:38:30.449
have been modeled and discussed
in great detail.

00:38:30.449 --> 00:38:33.914
There's even some empirical
work on just how high dimensions

00:38:33.914 --> 00:38:35.969
are really involved in
elections.

00:38:35.969 --> 00:38:40.090
So this is great stuff for this
area of Political Science.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.362
I want to inspire you to take
some more advanced courses

00:38:44.362 --> 00:38:48.815
albeit in another department.
So have I convinced you that

00:38:48.815 --> 00:38:52.760
there's something you can do
with iterative deletion?

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:56.986
We used iterative deletion in a
relatively abstract setting,

00:38:56.986 --> 00:39:00.352
or not abstract,
rather a play setting last time

00:39:00.352 --> 00:39:04.883
in which were choosing numbers.
And then we talked about it in

00:39:04.883 --> 00:39:08.470
terms of Hannibal invading Rome.
And now we've seen how it

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.320
applies here in an election
game.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.340
I think that's probably enough
for iterative deletion.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.481
So what I want to do now is I
want to switch course and

00:39:15.481 --> 00:39:17.699
introduce a new tool.
This is what we'll do typically

00:39:17.699 --> 00:39:18.720
in the class,
we'll have new tools.

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.600
We'll see how they apply.
We'll see what we can learn

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.329
with them.
And we'll move onto a new tool.

00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:24.590
So I'm going to switch to a new
tool.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:29.300
Any questions at this point?
Everyone happy at this point?

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.269
Happy is too strong--are people
satisfied at this point?

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:37.315
Okay, so we're going to move
away from this example and I'm

00:39:37.315 --> 00:39:40.360
going to introduce a new
subject,

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:46.417
and I'll need several boards I
think, so I might as well

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:48.070
collect them.

00:40:00.789 --> 00:40:03.289
That little semi-religious
speech about modeling,

00:40:03.289 --> 00:40:05.840
I think economists,
those of you who are Economics

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.599
majors you're thinking,
yeah, what's the problem?

00:40:08.599 --> 00:40:11.062
For those of you who are
History majors or Political

00:40:11.062 --> 00:40:13.090
Science majors,
that's more of an issue.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.210
So you really want to think
about why we're modeling,

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.369
what do we get from this
exercise?

00:40:18.369 --> 00:40:26.663
I want to move to a different
approach now and a different

00:40:26.663 --> 00:40:33.647
approach to analyzing games is
going to be about,

00:40:33.647 --> 00:40:40.050
what we're going to call,
best response.

00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:54.909
To kick this off,
let's look at an example.

00:40:54.909 --> 00:40:56.906
So here's a game,
a very simple game with two

00:40:56.906 --> 00:40:58.829
players.
Player I is choosing Up,

00:40:58.829 --> 00:41:02.215
Middle, or Down.
And Player II is choosing Left

00:41:02.215 --> 00:41:05.500
or Right, and the payoffs are as
follows.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.960
They're nothing very
interesting.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:12.325
They're just numbers thought up
for the purpose:

00:41:12.325 --> 00:41:16.964
(4,2) and (2,3).
So we've got (5,1),

00:41:16.964 --> 00:41:20.501
(0,2), (1,3),
(4,1), (4,2),

00:41:20.501 --> 00:41:23.551
and (2,3).
So, first of all,

00:41:23.551 --> 00:41:28.302
let's try and analyze this game
using the tools we've learned so

00:41:28.302 --> 00:41:33.426
far.
So does either player have a

00:41:33.426 --> 00:41:38.550
dominated strategy?
Any takers?

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:41.552
So I claim that neither player
has a dominated strategy,

00:41:41.552 --> 00:41:44.098
let's just check.
So, for example,

00:41:44.098 --> 00:41:49.188
you might think Down is
dominated, but if we look a bit

00:41:49.188 --> 00:41:54.278
carefully we see that Down
actually does better than Up

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:58.901
against Right,
and Down does better than

00:41:58.901 --> 00:42:03.012
Middle against Left.
Similarly, we can see that

00:42:03.012 --> 00:42:06.544
Right is not dominated,
because it does better against

00:42:06.544 --> 00:42:09.122
Up, than does Left.
But Left isn't dominated

00:42:09.122 --> 00:42:11.950
because it does better against
Middle than does Right …

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.346
so on and so forth.
You can work through this game

00:42:14.346 --> 00:42:17.099
and you can check pretty quickly
that nothing is dominated.

00:42:17.099 --> 00:42:21.441
So if the only tool I taught
you in this class was dominated

00:42:21.441 --> 00:42:25.855
strategies and the iterative
deletion of dominated strategies

00:42:25.855 --> 00:42:28.524
we'd be stuck.
You wouldn't be able to get

00:42:28.524 --> 00:42:30.226
started on this game.
Nevertheless,

00:42:30.226 --> 00:42:32.840
it's a pretty simple game,
pretty straightforward game.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.316
Imagine you're Player I in this
game, what do you think you'd

00:42:37.316 --> 00:42:40.381
do?
What would you do if you were

00:42:40.381 --> 00:42:42.523
Player I?
Let's have a show of hands

00:42:42.523 --> 00:42:44.969
actually.
So let's just see,

00:42:44.969 --> 00:42:48.800
look at it a bit.
No abstentions.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.170
How many of you would choose Up?
Raise your hand for Up.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.935
Raise your hands right now.
Keep your hand down,

00:42:54.935 --> 00:42:57.580
you're an SOM student.
You can keep your hand up.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:01.539
Oh, your math was wrong, okay.
You did accounting last year.

00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:03.599
No one's choosing Up?No one's
choosing Up at all,

00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:06.560
okay.
How about Middle?

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.440
One person chose Middle.
How about Down?

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:14.076
Oh my goodness.
Okay there's a massive majority

00:43:14.076 --> 00:43:17.139
for Down.
So let's think about this a

00:43:17.139 --> 00:43:21.792
second.
What if you knew that Player II

00:43:21.792 --> 00:43:27.471
was going to choose Left?
What would you choose if you

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:31.835
just happened to know that
Player II was going to choose

00:43:31.835 --> 00:43:34.415
Left?
Everyone agree because 5 is

00:43:34.415 --> 00:43:37.081
bigger than 1,
and 5 is bigger than 4,

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:40.612
so Up is--and to use a
technical term we'll define

00:43:40.612 --> 00:43:44.720
formally next time--Up is the
best response to Left.

00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:50.684
Everyone agree with that?
So Up, as I say,

00:43:50.684 --> 00:44:00.132
does best against left.
Now what does best against

00:44:00.132 --> 00:44:04.274
Right?
Middle does best against Right,

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:09.816
after all, 4 is bigger than 0
and 4 is bigger than 2,

00:44:09.816 --> 00:44:13.760
so Middle does best against
Right.

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:17.949
So here's an interesting thing.
All of you chose Down,

00:44:17.949 --> 00:44:21.629
but Up does best against Left
and Middle does best against

00:44:21.629 --> 00:44:23.569
Right.
Let's just push this a bit

00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:25.869
harder, suppose that you work
for somebody.

00:44:25.869 --> 00:44:28.624
Some of you are going to go out
of Yale and be your own boss,

00:44:28.624 --> 00:44:31.242
but most of you are going to,
like me, are going to end up

00:44:31.242 --> 00:44:34.601
working for somebody.
And suppose now this game came

00:44:34.601 --> 00:44:38.139
along in your line of work and
you'd chosen up.

00:44:38.139 --> 00:44:40.864
Then your boss came to you,
and looks rather fiercely at

00:44:40.864 --> 00:44:43.488
you--so this is Rick Levin or
somebody--looking rather

00:44:43.488 --> 00:44:47.323
fiercely at me,
and says "why did you choose

00:44:47.323 --> 00:44:49.320
Up?"
What can I do?

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.133
I can say: "oh I chose Up
because I thought the other guy

00:44:53.133 --> 00:44:57.760
was going to choose Left."
I have a way of rationalizing

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.549
choosing Up.
I believe the other guy is

00:45:00.549 --> 00:45:03.750
going to choose Left,
I can rationalize choosing Up.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.284
Is that right?
Because that might save me from

00:45:06.284 --> 00:45:07.619
getting fired,
at least for now.

00:45:07.619 --> 00:45:11.105
Similarly, if I had chosen
Middle and President Levin comes

00:45:11.105 --> 00:45:14.170
along to me and says "why did
you choose Middle?"

00:45:14.170 --> 00:45:18.542
I can say: "okay I chose Middle
because I believed that the

00:45:18.542 --> 00:45:22.914
other guy was going to choose
Right and Middle was the best

00:45:22.914 --> 00:45:27.060
thing for me to do against
Right." Once again,

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:31.730
if I'm lucky I won't get fired.
It seems like I've managed to

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:36.780
rationalize choosing middle.
But Down, all of you chose Down.

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:39.400
Pretty much all of you chose
Down.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.829
Down is going to be a little
trickier.

00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:44.280
How am I going to rationalize
choosing down?

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.430
Can I rationalize choosing Down?
You all chose it.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:52.210
I'm your boss now.
Why did you choose down?

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:53.710
Somebody who hasn't said
anything yet.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.141
Can I get the mikes up and
perhaps the person right in

00:45:56.141 --> 00:45:58.739
front of you.
Stand up and shout.

00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:00.735
Student: It's the safer
answer if you can't decide

00:46:00.735 --> 00:46:02.980
whether or not your opponent's
going to choose Left or Right,

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.079
so you don't have to worry
about having a payoff of 0.

00:46:05.079 --> 00:46:08.100
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so in some sense it's

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:10.926
safer, it avoids the 0,
although--I mean it's true it

00:46:10.926 --> 00:46:13.860
avoids the 0--but it also
doesn't get the 5 and the 4.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.825
But I think the key part of
your answer was I might not

00:46:17.825 --> 00:46:20.046
know.
I might not be sure whether the

00:46:20.046 --> 00:46:23.239
opponent, whether my opponent,
is choosing Left or Right.

00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:25.961
For example,
I might believe that it's

00:46:25.961 --> 00:46:29.345
equally likely that they choose
Left and Right,

00:46:29.345 --> 00:46:31.929
is that right?
So let's look at something.

00:46:31.929 --> 00:46:35.414
Let's look at my payoffs from
choosing these three options Up,

00:46:35.414 --> 00:46:39.487
Middle, and Down,
if I think it's equally likely

00:46:39.487 --> 00:46:43.969
that my opponent will choose
Left and Right.

00:46:43.969 --> 00:46:50.022
So what we're going to look at
is the expected payoff of Up

00:46:50.022 --> 00:46:54.717
versus, let me call it a
(½, ½):

00:46:54.717 --> 00:46:59.100
a (½,
½) being equally likely

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.900
that my opponent chooses Left
and Right.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.570
So what's my expected payoff
from choosing Up where I believe

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:10.567
the other person's going to
choose Left and Right,

00:47:10.567 --> 00:47:12.340
equally likely?
It's what?

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:19.240
It's a ½
times 5 plus ½

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:27.030
times 0 for a total of 2.5.
Is that right?

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:31.426
What about my expected payoff
from choosing Middle against

00:47:31.426 --> 00:47:35.306
(½, ½),
so in this case where I think

00:47:35.306 --> 00:47:39.448
it's equally likely that my
opponents going to choose Left

00:47:39.448 --> 00:47:42.980
or Right?
So in this case,

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:51.626
my expected payoff is a
½ of 1 plus a ½

00:47:51.626 --> 00:47:57.880
of 4, for a total of again 2.5.
Everyone happy with that?

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:06.353
Is my math correct so far?
How about my expected payoff

00:48:06.353 --> 00:48:11.039
from choosing down versus
(½, ½)?

00:48:11.039 --> 00:48:18.684
This is going to equal a
½ of 4 plus a ½

00:48:18.684 --> 00:48:25.320
of 2, which is a ½
of 6, so that's 3.

00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:28.303
So it turns out that,
as the gentleman out there

00:48:28.303 --> 00:48:31.857
said, if I thought it was
equally likely that my opponent

00:48:31.857 --> 00:48:34.269
was going to choose Left or
Right,

00:48:34.269 --> 00:48:39.704
then actually my best choice,
my best response is to choose

00:48:39.704 --> 00:48:41.264
Down.
Not only is it a good

00:48:41.264 --> 00:48:42.730
compromise., Not only is it
safe.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:49.680
It's actually the best I can do.
It maximizes my expected payoff.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:52.682
Now we're not quite there yet.
We know that Up does best

00:48:52.682 --> 00:48:55.032
against Left.
We know that Middle does best

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:57.009
against Right.
And we know that Down does best

00:48:57.009 --> 00:48:59.621
if I think it was equally likely
that the person was going to

00:48:59.621 --> 00:49:02.556
choose Left and Right.
But that's not the only beliefs

00:49:02.556 --> 00:49:04.405
I could have.
For example,

00:49:04.405 --> 00:49:09.316
I could believe that it's twice
as likely that the person's

00:49:09.316 --> 00:49:12.741
going to choose Left as Right.
It could be,

00:49:12.741 --> 00:49:15.320
they're twice as likely to
choose Left as Right.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.461
So equally likely was
probabilities of ½

00:49:17.461 --> 00:49:19.659
and ½.
What probabilities are

00:49:19.659 --> 00:49:23.817
associated with thinking it's
twice as likely they're going to

00:49:23.817 --> 00:49:27.101
choose Left than Right?
What probabilities are

00:49:27.101 --> 00:49:29.369
associated with that:
(2/3,1/3).

00:49:29.369 --> 00:49:32.610
If I thought there was 2/3
probability they'd choose Left

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:35.039
and 1/3 probability they'd
choose Right,

00:49:35.039 --> 00:49:37.731
then I think it's twice as
likely they're going to choose

00:49:37.731 --> 00:49:39.750
Left, and I could redo this
calculation.

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:43.035
And in principle,
I could redo this calculation

00:49:43.035 --> 00:49:47.250
for every single possible
probability you could think of.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:50.454
But that would get very boring,
so rather than do that,

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:51.820
let's draw a picture.

00:49:56.929 --> 00:50:02.566
What I want to do is I want to
draw a picture here,

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:08.428
in which on the horizontal
axis, I'm going to put the

00:50:08.428 --> 00:50:13.840
probability of the other guy
choosing Right.

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.280
It's my belief that the other
guy's going to choose Right.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:28.769
Think of this as a belief.
On the vertical axis--I'll put

00:50:28.769 --> 00:50:36.758
two vertical axes in,
just for the sake of things--on

00:50:36.758 --> 00:50:44.440
the vertical axis I'll put my
expected payoffs.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:48.249
And let's start by considering
my payoffs on this picture,

00:50:48.249 --> 00:50:52.260
just to help myself a bit,
let me put some points in here.

00:50:52.260 --> 00:51:00.634
So I've got 1,2, 3,4, 5.
You should probably do the same

00:51:00.634 --> 00:51:05.816
in your notes.
You probably have lined paper,

00:51:05.816 --> 00:51:11.284
that makes this easier.
Let's start by plotting my

00:51:11.284 --> 00:51:15.070
expected payoff from choosing
the strategy Up.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:19.656
So this isn't so hard,
we know that if I choose Up and

00:51:19.656 --> 00:51:24.674
there's probability 0 that the
other guy is going to choose

00:51:24.674 --> 00:51:27.542
Right,
that's the same as saying I

00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:31.769
choose Up and the other guy
chooses, let's try it again.

00:51:31.769 --> 00:51:35.328
If this probability is 0 that
the other guy chooses Right,

00:51:35.328 --> 00:51:39.198
that's the same as saying that
the other guy is going to choose

00:51:39.198 --> 00:51:41.883
Left.
So the probability is 0 of the

00:51:41.883 --> 00:51:44.643
other guy choosing Left is,
the same as,

00:51:44.643 --> 00:51:47.759
let's try it again.
Probability is 0 of their

00:51:47.759 --> 00:51:51.190
choosing Right is the same as
saying they choose Left,

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:56.348
so that my payoff from Up
against that is given by the top

00:51:56.348 --> 00:51:58.519
box up there,
I get 5.

00:51:58.519 --> 00:52:08.389
So this is my payoff from
choosing Up against Left.

00:52:08.389 --> 00:52:13.051
Conversely, if there was
probability 1 that the other guy

00:52:13.051 --> 00:52:16.464
is going to choose Right,
and I choose Up,

00:52:16.464 --> 00:52:20.561
then I get 0.
So this point here corresponds

00:52:20.561 --> 00:52:25.119
to my payoff if I choose Up and
they choose Right.

00:52:25.119 --> 00:52:30.906
And we already know if I look
at the probability of a

00:52:30.906 --> 00:52:35.965
½, which is here,
that the payoff I get from

00:52:35.965 --> 00:52:41.047
choosing, the expected payoff I
get from choosing up against a

00:52:41.047 --> 00:52:49.150
(½, ½) is 2.5.
So here's a third point we can

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:52.408
use.
What is this graph going to

00:52:52.408 --> 00:52:55.960
look like other than these three
points?

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.699
What's it going to look like
other than these three points?

00:52:58.699 --> 00:53:01.329
It's going to be a straight
line.

00:53:01.329 --> 00:53:03.829
So, you can confirm that for
yourself at home,

00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:05.941
but in fact,
if I draw a straight line,

00:53:05.941 --> 00:53:08.900
this will actually be correct.
So what is this?

00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:13.838
This is my expected payoff from
choosing Up against the

00:53:13.838 --> 00:53:18.320
probability of the other person
choosing Right,

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:21.243
and what is it actually equal
to, just to confirm the

00:53:21.243 --> 00:53:23.716
equation, it's:
(1 minus the probability that

00:53:23.716 --> 00:53:27.079
they choose Right),
in that case I'll get a payoff

00:53:27.079 --> 00:53:30.389
of 5 plus (probability that they
choose Right),

00:53:30.389 --> 00:53:34.300
in which case I get a payoff of
0.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:37.666
So it doesn't really matter,
but that's actually the

00:53:37.666 --> 00:53:40.989
equation of that line.
What about choosing Middle?

00:53:40.989 --> 00:53:43.416
Well once again,
we can plot that point So if

00:53:43.416 --> 00:53:46.449
the other person's choosing
Right with probability 0,

00:53:46.449 --> 00:53:48.627
that's the same as saying
they're going to choose Left,

00:53:48.627 --> 00:53:50.120
and if I chose Middle against
Left,

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:56.107
I get what?
I get 1, I should use this

00:53:56.107 --> 00:53:58.691
pointer.
So that's here,

00:53:58.691 --> 00:54:01.107
and if I knew they were
choosing Right for sure,

00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:04.139
that's the probability of 1
that they're choosing Right,

00:54:04.139 --> 00:54:09.719
and if I choose Middle I get 4,
that's here.

00:54:09.719 --> 00:54:12.062
And we've already agreed that
if I think it's equally likely

00:54:12.062 --> 00:54:13.690
they're going to choose right
and left,

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:17.667
that there's a probability
½ of them choosing right

00:54:17.667 --> 00:54:21.759
I get 2.5 from choosing Middle.
So putting that all together,

00:54:21.759 --> 00:54:25.277
I know that it must go through
here again, and once again,

00:54:25.277 --> 00:54:27.825
I get a straight line.
I think I might have missed

00:54:27.825 --> 00:54:29.240
slightly but it's more or less
right.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:33.330
So what is this?
This is the payoff to Player I

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:39.113
of choosing Middle against Left.
This is the payoff to Player I

00:54:39.113 --> 00:54:44.449
of choosing Middle against
Right, and the line in between,

00:54:44.449 --> 00:54:47.533
this line here,
is the expected payoff to

00:54:47.533 --> 00:54:52.467
Player I of choosing Middle as a
function of the probability that

00:54:52.467 --> 00:54:56.191
other people choose Right.
Now again, we could write down

00:54:56.191 --> 00:54:58.498
the equation.
it's going to be:

00:54:58.498 --> 00:55:03.733
(1 minus the probability
they'll choose Right) times 1,

00:55:03.733 --> 00:55:09.260
plus (the probability that they
choose Right) times 4.

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.148
Again, don't worry too much
about the equation,

00:55:11.148 --> 00:55:12.873
we're not really going to do
any math here,

00:55:12.873 --> 00:55:14.680
I'm just putting it in for
completeness.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.756
Everyone following me so far?
So let's put in now,

00:55:18.756 --> 00:55:20.905
the third of these lines.
I really should have used a

00:55:20.905 --> 00:55:22.869
different color already.
Let me switch colors.

00:55:22.869 --> 00:55:27.099
Let's put the line that
corresponds to choosing Down.

00:55:27.099 --> 00:55:31.988
So that third line,
not to belabor the point,

00:55:31.988 --> 00:55:38.099
is going to go through here,
through 4 and through 2,

00:55:38.099 --> 00:55:42.421
so this is the payoff from
choosing Down against Left,

00:55:42.421 --> 00:55:47.150
and this is the payoff from
choosing Down against Right,

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:53.960
and I got those from looking at
these payoffs here and here.

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:59.610
In between, once again,
it's a straight line.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:05.193
So here's the straight line,
and this line is the expected

00:56:05.193 --> 00:56:10.776
payoff to Player I from choosing
Down as it depends on the

00:56:10.776 --> 00:56:15.869
probability that the other
person chooses Right,

00:56:15.869 --> 00:56:17.980
and then once again,
we can write down the equation.

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:29.190
It's (1 minus PR) times 4,
plus PR times 2.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:33.483
I claim that this picture
really tells me everything I

00:56:33.483 --> 00:56:37.940
could possibly want to know when
my boss comes along.

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:41.467
When President Levin or Barry
Nalebuff who is now walking to

00:56:41.467 --> 00:56:44.396
the back of the room,
when my boss comes along and

00:56:44.396 --> 00:56:47.010
asks me why did you do that?
Why did you do that?

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:51.978
I can now say.
So, for example--let's put in

00:56:51.978 --> 00:56:58.989
these crossing points here,
for example--what I can say is,

00:56:58.989 --> 00:57:02.349
if I think it's very likely
–let's call this point

00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:05.281
X--if I think that the
probability that the other

00:57:05.281 --> 00:57:09.021
person's going to choose Right,
is less than X,

00:57:09.021 --> 00:57:15.429
then the highest payoff I can
get corresponds to this line.

00:57:15.429 --> 00:57:19.900
That's the highest line and
that line corresponds to me

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:23.368
choosing Up.
If I think the probability that

00:57:23.368 --> 00:57:27.614
they're going to choose Right is
less than X, then my best

00:57:27.614 --> 00:57:31.734
response is to choose Up.
Conversely, if I think it's

00:57:31.734 --> 00:57:35.955
more likely than this crossing
point Y--I think it's very

00:57:35.955 --> 00:57:38.969
likely they're going to choose
Right.

00:57:38.969 --> 00:57:41.780
It's more likely than Y--the
probability that they're going

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:45.343
to choose Right is more than Y,
then the highest line of these

00:57:45.343 --> 00:57:48.026
three is this one,
which corresponds to my

00:57:48.026 --> 00:57:50.236
choosing Middle.
So over here,

00:57:50.236 --> 00:57:53.060
my best response is to choose
Middle.

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:58.589
Let's put that in.
So over here my best response

00:57:58.589 --> 00:58:05.440
is Middle and over here my best
response is Up,

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:09.537
and in between it's going to
turn out that the highest lines,

00:58:09.537 --> 00:58:13.566
if my belief that the person's
going to choose right is more

00:58:13.566 --> 00:58:17.583
than X and less than Y,
then my highest expected payoff

00:58:17.583 --> 00:58:21.088
comes from that blue line,
and in that case my best

00:58:21.088 --> 00:58:24.901
response is Down.
I can rationalize all three of

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:29.000
these decisions and hope that
Barry won't fire me.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.258
Now we can do more than that if
we're being nerdy,

00:58:31.258 --> 00:58:33.239
but I'm not going to be this
nerdy today.

00:58:33.239 --> 00:58:39.810
What we can actually do is we
could solve out for the X and

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:41.923
for the Y.
How would we go about,

00:58:41.923 --> 00:58:43.841
I mean I don't want to do it
because I'll probably get it

00:58:43.841 --> 00:58:45.579
wrong,
but if I wanted to solve out

00:58:45.579 --> 00:58:48.030
for this X and the Y,
since this is a QR class,

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:49.330
let's just talk about it a
second.

00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:52.557
How would I do it?
Somebody who's not a math

00:58:52.557 --> 00:58:55.648
major, tell me how I solve out
for the--maybe the math majors

00:58:55.648 --> 00:58:57.760
can't do it actually,
it's too simple.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.745
Somebody who is a math major,
tell me how to solve out for

00:59:02.745 --> 00:59:06.816
the X and the Y.
Let's get a mike on this person

00:59:06.816 --> 00:59:08.311
here.
Student: Set the

00:59:08.311 --> 00:59:10.643
intersection points equal,
the equations equal to each

00:59:10.643 --> 00:59:13.431
other and solve.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:59:13.431 --> 00:59:17.766
Good, good to define--to solve
out for X: X is when this blue

00:59:17.766 --> 00:59:21.307
line equals, sorry,
this blue line equals this red

00:59:21.307 --> 00:59:24.378
line.
So what we're going to do is

00:59:24.378 --> 00:59:29.493
take the equations for those two
lines, so here's one of those

00:59:29.493 --> 00:59:32.679
equations and here's the other
one,

00:59:32.679 --> 00:59:36.899
set the P in those equations
equal to X, I've got two

00:59:36.899 --> 00:59:40.559
equations in one unknown,
I'm sorry, I've got one

00:59:40.559 --> 00:59:43.387
equation and one unknown.
I've set these two things equal

00:59:43.387 --> 00:59:45.005
to each other:
I've got one equation and one

00:59:45.005 --> 00:59:46.800
unknown.
So I can solve out for X.

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.870
I think I did that at home.
If you do that at home I think,

00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:53.081
but don't trust me,
you'll find out that X is equal

00:59:53.081 --> 00:59:54.881
to a third.
Now, just to repeat,

00:59:54.881 --> 00:59:57.449
again I know I've got some math
phobics in the audience,

00:59:57.449 --> 01:00:00.696
let me just slow down a second,
all I'm doing here is I'm

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:03.480
saying look at this equation of
the pink line,

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.943
look at this equation of the
blue line, X is when they cross,

01:00:06.943 --> 01:00:09.079
i.e., they are equal to each
other.

01:00:09.079 --> 01:00:15.428
Take these two equations,
put an equal sign between them,

01:00:15.428 --> 01:00:19.510
replace this PR throughout with
X,

01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:22.647
I'm going to have one equation
and one unknown and that even

01:00:22.647 --> 01:00:25.520
the math phobics in the audience
did in high school.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.657
Is that right?
Now we're going to--I'm going a

01:00:29.657 --> 01:00:33.403
bit slow here--but I'm going to
use this method next time to

01:00:33.403 --> 01:00:36.260
introduce you to the most
important class,

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:39.920
sorry, the most important game
we're going to see in the whole

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.729
course.
In fact, it's the most

01:00:42.729 --> 01:00:48.792
important game in the world.
What is the most important game

01:00:48.792 --> 01:00:51.820
in the world?
Don't go yet.

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:53.400
What's the most important game
in the world?

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.480
We're going to use this idea of
best response.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:57.998
We're going to think about it,
and we're going to learn from

01:00:57.998 --> 01:00:59.920
it in the most important game in
the world.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.860
What is the most important game
in the world?

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:06.438
Football: soccer actually.
Soccer is the most important

01:01:06.438 --> 01:01:08.659
game.
So we're going to show how this

01:01:08.659 --> 01:01:12.159
technique is going to help us
shoot penalty shots in soccer.

01:01:12.159 --> 01:01:14.658
Before you go,
that's Barry Nalebuff at the

01:01:14.658 --> 01:01:17.632
back, he has copies of the book,
it's a great book,

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:18.965
go buy it from him.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.840
We can do the following problem.
 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.357
You give me any number of
charges which are fixed,

00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:12.610
anywhere you want.
 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.870
So here they are.
 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.234
Here's one guy
q_1,

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:20.220
here's q_2,
here's q_3.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.889
And instead of these discrete
charges, you may have a line

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.980
charge too, maybe λ
coulombs per meter.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.140
That guy is here.
 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.340
They are fixed.
 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.280
They are not dynamical.
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.954
The object of interest to us is
this charge q,

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:43.820
which can actually move,
allowed to move.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.236
The question we ask is,
do we know what this charge

00:00:48.236 --> 00:00:49.120
will do?
 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.150
And the answer is,
yes, we know what it will do,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.567
because if it's sitting here
and we have already computed the

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:57.175
electric field everywhere--
you know how to compute

00:00:57.175 --> 00:00:57.840
electric field.
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.771
Add the field due to this one,
that one, that one,

00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:01.429
add that.
 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.968
That is some electric field
sitting here.

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:08.593
Then we know,
the force on this charge we're

00:01:08.593 --> 00:01:11.710
interested in,
this q times the

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.840
electric field at the location
of the charge.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.763
So at every instant,
we know what force is acting on

00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:19.049
it.
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.456
Then from Newton's law,
that will give me the rate of

00:01:24.456 --> 00:01:28.720
change of velocity or the
acceleration.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.970
You can write it either way.
 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.721
That's all I need,
because using that I can find

00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.714
out the new position,
new velocity,

00:01:35.714 --> 00:01:36.300
right?
 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.959
The acceleration tells you,
if you wait 1 nanosecond,

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:43.519
you go to this place,
because the initial velocity,

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:45.867
I can predict where it will be,
and because you know the

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:48.732
acceleration,
I know what velocity it will

00:01:48.732 --> 00:01:49.200
have.
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.420
Then I keep on updating it and
I get my trajectory.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.069
Student:  I think it
should be dt squared.

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:02.739
Prof: Yes, thank you.
 

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:06.590
So everyone understands this is
how you proceed.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.127
This charge will of course push
those guys, but we're not

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:11.030
worried, because we don't let
them move.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.360
They are just fixed.
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.520
And if there are much such
charges, we can find what they

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.236
all do in this environment,
which is the background

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:22.650
electric field.
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.919
That's all we can do right now,
this is electrostatics.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.401
In the real world,
everybody is moving and all

00:02:27.401 --> 00:02:29.664
kinds of stuff happens,
but you cannot use

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:31.210
electrostatics for that.
 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.733
This asymmetry between the
background and the test charge

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:37.878
that we are studying is in the
static situation.

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:41.370
Guys that move and guys that
don't.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.340
Now this is something you could
have done on the first day,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.377
because I think on the very
first day I told you about

00:02:46.377 --> 00:02:49.300
Coulomb's law and the principle
of superposition.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.666
If you put them together,
you know the force on a charge

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:53.340
q.
 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.210
Then you use F = ma,
you predict its trajectory.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.711
But in principle,
that's all you need to do

00:02:59.711 --> 00:03:02.655
electrostatic problems,
but in practice you want to

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:04.620
clean up the machinery a little
bit,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.188
make it more efficient.
 

00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:08.900
For example,
we found Gauss's law.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.157
Gauss's law follows from
Coulomb's law,

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:13.120
but we found it's quite useful.
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.979
For example,
if we give you a ball of

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.873
charge, spherical charge,
going back to Coulomb's law and

00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:19.889
first principles is very
difficult.

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.938
But if you use Gauss's law and
the symmetries,

00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:23.959
you're able to find the
electric field around the

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.465
sphere,
or an infinitely long cylinder,

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:30.030
or an infinite plane or simple
geometries like that.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.997
So it's not enough to say
"I've got the basic

00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:32.720
equations."
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.812
You always want to see if there
are ways to speed up the

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:39.788
computation to make it more
efficient.

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:49.645
So let me remind you what we
did in the first part of the

00:03:49.645 --> 00:03:51.229
course.
 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.205
There, if you have the
following question - here's a

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:59.712
spring and here's a mass,
the spring likes to have that

00:03:59.712 --> 00:04:04.598
length and I pulled it to way
over there and I released it,

00:04:04.598 --> 00:04:06.539
and right now it happens to be
here,

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:08.508
going at some speed.
 

00:04:08.508 --> 00:04:12.870
I want to know what velocity it
will have when it is here,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.878
so this position is
x_1,

00:04:14.878 --> 00:04:16.319
this speed is
v_1,

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.028
this position is
x_2.

00:04:18.028 --> 00:04:20.569
I want to know
v_2.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.860
That's a reasonable thing you
can ask.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.608
Unlike the electric force,
the force on this mass is due

00:04:27.608 --> 00:04:28.990
to the spring.
 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.790
Apart from that,
it's the same situation.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.379
So one way to do that is to
say, I know F = ma,

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:38.129
so the instant you start the
problem here,

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.980
I know the acceleration because
the force of the spring is

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.579
-k times x_1.
 

00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:45.230
Once I know the force,
I know the acceleration.

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.440
I can find the new velocity,
new position,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.310
keep on doing it,
or I can solve the equation,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.899
d^(2)x/dt^(2) is
−kx/m,

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:55.750
and I can eventually end up
here.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.430
Then I can find the velocity
here.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:05.607
But we all know that in this
problem, there's a shortcut,

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:06.490
right?
 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.490
Yes?
 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.329
Anybody in the last row want to
tell me what the shortcut is?

00:05:13.329 --> 00:05:14.569
Yes?
 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.670
Student:  You can use
conservation of energy.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.389
Prof: Conservation of
energy.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.975
So conservation of energy is a
consequence of Newton's laws and

00:05:23.975 --> 00:05:26.490
certain properties of the force.
 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.949
I'm going to remind you how
it's done.

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.524
One attitude I could take is,
you've already done this

00:05:33.524 --> 00:05:37.706
before, but usually it's better
to make sure that you're all on

00:05:37.706 --> 00:05:40.000
the same page when we do this.
 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.480
So let me remind you how it
works there.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:52.220
You go to Newton's laws and we
write m dv/dt =

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.850
F.
 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:54.990
It's all in one dimension
though.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.339
I'm moving just along the line.
 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:05.610
Then I multiply both sides by
v.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.805
On the left hand side,
if you know basic calculus,

00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:12.802
this is really
d/dt of

00:06:12.802 --> 00:06:17.170
mv^(2)/2,
by the chain rule of calculus.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.810
The d/dt derivative is
the v derivative,

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.452
followed by the derivative of
v with respect to

00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:23.100
t.
 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.740
v derivative will give
you mv and then there is

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.050
that.
 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.949
This becomes F
dx/dt.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:36.970
This means in every tiny
instant of time,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.475
the force times the change in
the position is equal to the

00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:46.964
change in this quantity,
which we know is called kinetic

00:06:46.964 --> 00:06:47.829
energy.
 

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:51.449
So if you multiply both sides
by dt,

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:54.795
then you find this relation,
and if you add up all the

00:06:54.795 --> 00:06:56.843
changes,
we get this relation,

00:06:56.843 --> 00:07:00.776
m--so let's see what we
are integrating from a starting

00:07:00.776 --> 00:07:04.129
point to an ending point and
some starting time,

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:06.149
ending time.
 

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:09.663
We get
mv_2^(2)/2 -

00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:13.377
mv_1^(2)/2 =
integral

00:07:13.377 --> 00:07:18.899
f(x)dx from
x_1 to

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:21.610
x_2.
 

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:29.370
And this is called the work
energy theorem.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.757
The work energy theorem tells
you something you may expect,

00:07:32.757 --> 00:07:36.261
namely, when a force acts on a
body, it's going to accelerate

00:07:36.261 --> 00:07:36.670
it.
 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.906
It's going to accelerate it,
it's going to change the

00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:39.379
velocity.
 

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:41.497
You're going to ask,
"How much velocity change

00:07:41.497 --> 00:07:43.660
do I get for a certain action of
the force?"

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.060
and the statement is,
the force pushes the body from

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.319
x_1 to
x_2,

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:54.220
then this is the change in this
quantity called kinetic energy.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:57.300
This is true no matter what the
force is.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.331
It's true for friction,
it's true for spring,

00:08:00.331 --> 00:08:04.120
it's true for everything,
because Newton's law is always

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.810
valid.
 

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.418
But if you want to extract from
this a law of conservation of

00:08:08.418 --> 00:08:12.266
energy, you have to do a certain
manipulation and that's what I'm

00:08:12.266 --> 00:08:13.588
going to describe.
 

00:08:13.588 --> 00:08:19.403
So let's go back here and try
to extract from it a law of

00:08:19.403 --> 00:08:22.000
conservation of energy.
 

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.495
So I'm going to write here
k_2 -

00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:30.230
k_1 is integral
F(x) dx,

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:36.690
from x_1 to
x_2.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.532
Now it's a fundamental result
in calculus that integral of any

00:08:40.532 --> 00:08:44.186
function of x from the
point x_1 to

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:47.147
the point x_2
can be written as

00:08:47.147 --> 00:08:51.620
G(x_2) -
G(x_1),

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.889
where G is any function
whose derivative is the F

00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:59.710
I'm integrating.
 

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.256
For example,
if F = x,

00:09:02.256 --> 00:09:06.259
G = x^(2)/2,
because derivative

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:09.080
x^(2)/2 is x.
 

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.668
In fact, it's not just
x^(2)/2 .

00:09:10.668 --> 00:09:14.160
You can add x^(2)/2 a
constant, but the constant is

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.856
not important,
because they'll cancel between

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:17.960
this and this.
 

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.101
So you can pick the solution
without a constant,

00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:21.570
okay?
 

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.460
Now what does that mean?
 

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.336
Let's rearrange the expression
so I get K_2

00:09:29.336 --> 00:09:32.559
−
G(x_2) =

00:09:32.559 --> 00:09:37.850
K_1 −
G(x_1).

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.253
That tells you the combination
K - G does not

00:09:41.253 --> 00:09:44.480
change as the particle moves,
but this doesn't look very

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.009
nice.
 

00:09:45.009 --> 00:09:48.293
We want to get the old law of
conservation of energy in the

00:09:48.293 --> 00:09:49.200
standard form.
 

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.600
You define the function
U(x),

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.830
you simply - this
G(x).

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.440
It's a very trivial change.
 

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.578
Then you can say
K_2

00:09:57.578 --> 00:10:00.669
U(x_2) =
K_1

00:10:00.669 --> 00:10:06.629
U(x_1),
and that is the energy that

00:10:06.629 --> 00:10:10.450
does not change with time.
 

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:15.298
So the relation between
U, which is called the

00:10:15.298 --> 00:10:18.191
potential energy,
and the force,

00:10:18.191 --> 00:10:20.149
is the following.
 

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:26.220
The force is - the derivative
of the potential energy.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.403
The - came because G is
the integral of F,

00:10:30.403 --> 00:10:33.979
but U is -G,
so that this formula,

00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:36.870
this means you have this
relation.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.774
And you can also say
U(x_2)

00:10:39.774 --> 00:10:41.926
−
U(x_1)

00:10:41.926 --> 00:10:44.657
with an integral of
F(x) dx

00:10:44.657 --> 00:10:47.970
from x_1 to
x_2,

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.620
there's a - sign here.
 

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.846
Again, the - sign is present
because F is defined to

00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:57.908
be - the derivative of U.
 

00:10:57.908 --> 00:11:00.442
So you can go back and forth
from potential to force and

00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:01.408
force to potential.
 

00:11:01.408 --> 00:11:03.513
If you knew the force,
you can integrate it to get the

00:11:03.513 --> 00:11:03.990
potential.
 

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.187
If you knew the potential,
you can differentiate it to get

00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:07.885
the force,
and more importantly,

00:11:07.885 --> 00:11:10.110
you have this great
conservation law,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.288
which is very helpful in the
spring problem,

00:11:12.288 --> 00:11:14.080
because if you know the
potential energy,

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.528
once and for all,
it's kx^(2)/2,

00:11:16.528 --> 00:11:18.418
you balance the kinetic and the
potential,

00:11:18.418 --> 00:11:23.500
you can find the velocity at
one other point.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.538
Now why doesn't this work for
friction?

00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:30.029
Friction is the one dimensional
force.

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:31.070
Yes?
 

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.629
Student:  It's not
conservative.

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:33.870
Prof: It's not
conservative.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.009
It's just a definition.
 

00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:39.269
But what's wrong with my
argument?

00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:43.429
Where in this argument does it
fail?

00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:44.970
It looks like any function--yes?
 

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.054
Student:  Because the
direction of the force depends

00:11:47.054 --> 00:11:48.710
on the direction that the
particle's moving.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:50.190
Prof: Very good.
 

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:54.296
The point is that frictional
force is not a function just of

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:55.409
your location.
 

00:11:55.409 --> 00:11:57.960
It depends on your velocity.
 

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.101
In other words,
whereas the spring will always

00:12:02.101 --> 00:12:06.019
exert a force -kx--
if you are displaced to the

00:12:06.019 --> 00:12:08.100
right by an x,
it exerts a force

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.200
-kx--whether or not
you're moving to the right,

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.970
away from the equilibrium or
towards it.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:16.331
Thus given x,
it gives you a given force,

00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:17.940
but friction is not like that.
 

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.250
Friction does not have a
definite direction.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.450
The only thing friction wants
to do is to slow you down.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:25.778
If you want to go right,
it wants to act left.

00:12:25.778 --> 00:12:28.399
If you want to go left,
it wants to act right.

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:31.340
I will resist all political
analogies.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:35.616
I'll just point out to you that
friction does not have a

00:12:35.616 --> 00:12:37.769
definite sign,
therefore it's not a function

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:38.947
of x,
but as she said,

00:12:38.947 --> 00:12:41.379
it's a function of x and
of x dot,

00:12:41.379 --> 00:12:42.750
which is the velocity.
 

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.129
So it doesn't have a unique
answer.

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:47.820
That does not mean you cannot
find the work due to friction.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.160
If you know it's moving to the
right, then the force is to the

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:50.428
left.
 

00:12:50.428 --> 00:12:53.802
You can integrate that force,
as long as it is moving to the

00:12:53.802 --> 00:12:54.259
right.
 

00:12:54.259 --> 00:12:55.851
But if it's going right,
left, right,

00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:58.019
left and oscillating,
then you cannot integrate it

00:12:58.019 --> 00:12:58.950
once and for all.
 

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.240
That way doesn't work for
friction.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.474
Now here's an even more
powerful example of the law of

00:13:05.474 --> 00:13:07.000
conservation of energy.
 

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.860
You have this famous roller
coaster and you are here.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.506
I say "you are here,"
because you'll never get me on

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:19.678
top of one of these guys.
 

00:13:19.678 --> 00:13:25.236
So you are here and you got
some speed, and I want to know

00:13:25.236 --> 00:13:28.259
your speed when you are here.
 

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.100
Again, it follows from Newton's
laws.

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.470
You can calculate from Newton's
laws,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:35.538
because at every point,
wherever you may be,

00:13:35.538 --> 00:13:40.323
there's the force of gravity
acting this way and there is the

00:13:40.323 --> 00:13:44.629
perpendicular force from the
track acting this way,

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:47.572
and the perpendicular force is
such that it cancels this part

00:13:47.572 --> 00:13:49.606
of gravity,
and this part of gravity will

00:13:49.606 --> 00:13:51.928
accelerate it and you can find
the velocity here.

00:13:51.928 --> 00:13:55.481
Keep doing this,
you can find the velocity at

00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:56.289
the end.
 

00:13:56.289 --> 00:13:58.019
But that's not how we do this.
 

00:13:58.019 --> 00:14:00.716
We use the fact that the
gravity force allows us to

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:03.035
define an energy,
and I'll come to that in a

00:14:03.035 --> 00:14:03.629
moment.
 

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:07.528
Then we say kinetic potential
is kinetic potential in the

00:14:07.528 --> 00:14:12.037
beginning and at the end,
and we can simply find the

00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:17.250
velocity here if you knew the
potential energy here.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.470
All right, so the law of
conservation of energy is also a

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.172
very profound result,
which has survived all the

00:14:23.172 --> 00:14:25.298
revolutions of quantum
mechanics.

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:28.048
After quantum mechanics,
we don't like to think in terms

00:14:28.048 --> 00:14:31.250
of force, and we don't like to
think in terms of trajectories.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:33.808
You don't even know for sure
where the particle is.

00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:37.429
But amazingly,
the total energy is always

00:14:37.429 --> 00:14:40.779
conserved in the problems we
study.

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:44.383
So the law of conservation of
energy is very profound and it's

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:46.509
also very useful for
computations.

00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:50.495
Now the next question I have
is, if I go to two

00:14:50.495 --> 00:14:55.259
dimensions--and it's the same as
in three dimensions.

00:14:55.259 --> 00:14:58.554
I'm just going to go to two
dimensions--what does it take to

00:14:58.554 --> 00:15:00.788
get the law of conservation of
energy?

00:15:00.788 --> 00:15:04.235
So I'm going to mimic this
derivation in 2D and see if I

00:15:04.235 --> 00:15:07.179
can pull out a law of
conservation of energy.

00:15:07.179 --> 00:15:09.528
So here's what I will do.
 

00:15:09.528 --> 00:15:13.855
So in two dimensions,
let me start this time with the

00:15:13.855 --> 00:15:15.269
kinetic energy.
 

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:18.163
Kinetic energy is
½mv^(2),

00:15:18.163 --> 00:15:19.926
but
v has got 2 components,

00:15:19.926 --> 00:15:21.975
x and y,
therefore it's

00:15:21.975 --> 00:15:24.750
½mvx^(2)
vy^(2),

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.530
but I'm going to write this
½m

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.730
v⋅v.
 

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.470
Then let me ask,
what's the rate of change of

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.340
this kinetic energy?
 

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.710
You've got to take derivatives.
 

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.077
Now you may be a little queasy
about taking derivatives from

00:15:41.077 --> 00:15:43.086
this dot product,
but you can check by expanding

00:15:43.086 --> 00:15:45.250
the component,
just like ordinary product,

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.460
and you can take derivative of
this guy times that guy,

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.548
derivative of that guy times
this guy,

00:15:50.548 --> 00:15:54.375
and they will both be the same,
and you will find it's equal to

00:15:54.375 --> 00:16:03.850
m dv/dt,
which is the force.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:09.950
I'm sorry.
 

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.659
Let me erase this.
 

00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:20.698
It's not m dv/dt;
it is mdv/dt

00:16:20.698 --> 00:16:24.788
⋅v.
 

00:16:24.788 --> 00:16:27.895
So if you integrate this,
cancel the dt and add

00:16:27.895 --> 00:16:30.500
all the changes,
you will find

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:36.695
K_2 -
K_1 is m

00:16:36.695 --> 00:16:45.259
times dr--
let me see--I'm sorry.

00:16:45.259 --> 00:16:47.936
I want to keep the
dv/dt here,

00:16:47.936 --> 00:16:51.669
then I want to write this
v as dr/dt.

00:16:51.669 --> 00:16:52.100
That's right.
 

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.519
So let me do the following,
excuse me.

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:55.418
Let me do it again.
 

00:16:55.418 --> 00:17:03.495
dK/dt = ma
times v and v is

00:17:03.495 --> 00:17:06.410
dr/dt.
 

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:10.855
Now we cancel the dts
and we write the change in

00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:15.465
K as K_2
- K_1 =

00:17:15.465 --> 00:17:19.006
integral of
F⋅dr from the

00:17:19.006 --> 00:17:22.382
starting point
r_1 to the

00:17:22.382 --> 00:17:25.838
ending point
r_2.

00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:28.586
In other words,
the change in kinetic energy in

00:17:28.586 --> 00:17:31.573
one dimension is just force
times distance for tiny

00:17:31.573 --> 00:17:32.410
distances.
 

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.098
In higher dimensions,
like in 2 dimensions,

00:17:35.098 --> 00:17:38.464
if the particle is moving in
the 2 dimensional plane along

00:17:38.464 --> 00:17:41.240
some path and it moves a
distance dr,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:44.450
and at that point,
the force is in that direction,

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.909
you should not simply take the
product of the length of the

00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:48.690
force times the length of the
distance,

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.859
but that times the cosine of
the angle.

00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:54.108
Why should it take that?
 

00:17:54.108 --> 00:17:56.636
Because that's what gives you
the rate of change of kinetic

00:17:56.636 --> 00:17:57.029
energy.
 

00:17:57.029 --> 00:18:00.230
Just go to the kinetic energy
and it suggests to you that you

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.900
take this product and define it
to be the work,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.720
because if you define it that
way, just like in 1D,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:10.549
the work done by the force will
be the change in kinetic energy.

00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:11.740
You guys with me now?
 

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:15.640
In spite of this little mess up
here, this ma is my force.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.180
The dts got canceled.
 

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:21.071
The dK is added up to
K_2 -

00:18:21.071 --> 00:18:24.808
K_1 and this is
the integral.

00:18:24.808 --> 00:18:29.759
All right, so now it looks
pretty good, except for the

00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:31.160
complication.
 

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.920
You have a dot product here.
 

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.502
You have this nice result that
K_2 -

00:18:36.502 --> 00:18:40.292
K_1 is the
integral F⋅dr

00:18:40.292 --> 00:18:44.288
from r_1 to
r_2.

00:18:44.288 --> 00:18:46.035
So let's imagine where
r_1 and

00:18:46.035 --> 00:18:47.058
r_2 are.
 

00:18:47.058 --> 00:18:52.336
This is say where you started,
and maybe you ended up here at

00:18:52.336 --> 00:18:54.358
r_2.
 

00:18:54.358 --> 00:18:56.922
You've just got to integrate
this F from

00:18:56.922 --> 00:18:59.538
r_1 to
r_2.

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:01.618
Let's imagine there is no
friction.

00:19:01.618 --> 00:19:04.690
Let's imagine F depends
only on the position.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.289
What's my problem now?
 

00:19:08.289 --> 00:19:13.450
What problem do we have?
 

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.750
Yes?
 

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.502
Student:  _______ going
from r_2 to

00:19:16.502 --> 00:19:17.440
r_1 _______.
 

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.104
Prof: No,
this integral gives me no

00:19:19.104 --> 00:19:19.470
choice.
 

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:23.422
I must go from
r_1 to

00:19:23.422 --> 00:19:25.880
r_2.
 

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.769
Anybody know what's the problem?
 

00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:28.740
Yes?
 

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.970
Student:  Your path.
 

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:31.858
Prof: Your path.
 

00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:34.673
See, in 1 dimension,
if I want to go from here to

00:19:34.673 --> 00:19:36.549
there, I have no choice,
okay?

00:19:36.549 --> 00:19:38.920
Just move along that line.
 

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.971
In 2 dimensions,
if you want to go from one

00:19:40.971 --> 00:19:43.170
point to another,
I can think of many ways.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:46.700
You can do that,
you can take the straight line

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.769
path, or you can take some other
path.

00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:52.548
That's an ambiguity we have in
higher dimensions.

00:19:52.548 --> 00:19:55.890
So even though the work energy
theorem is valid,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.488
and no matter which path you
take, the work done by the force

00:19:58.488 --> 00:20:00.220
will be the change in kinetic
energy,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:05.727
this is not in general equal to
some function at

00:20:05.727 --> 00:20:10.180
r_1 - some
function at

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:13.108
r_2.
 

00:20:13.108 --> 00:20:16.099
Because if it had this form,
we are done.

00:20:16.099 --> 00:20:16.778
You agree?
 

00:20:16.778 --> 00:20:19.133
If it had this form,
then again you write

00:20:19.133 --> 00:20:21.321
K_2 
U_2 =

00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:23.838
K_1
U_1.

00:20:23.838 --> 00:20:26.240
But no one's telling you that
is true.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.528
If it was true,
you are in business.

00:20:29.528 --> 00:20:32.880
But it's a very unreasonable
thing to ask of this force,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.990
that its integral from some
point to another point,

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:40.519
does not depend on what path
you integrate it on.

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:42.859
In other words,
you can take that path,

00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:46.309
break it up into segments
dr, and on each segment,

00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:48.220
the force is some variable.
 

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.003
You take F⋅dr
of that little segment,

00:20:51.003 --> 00:20:53.635
add it up over all the segments
and make the segments

00:20:53.635 --> 00:20:54.750
vanishingly small.
 

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.818
That's the meaning of this
integral.

00:20:56.818 --> 00:21:00.375
And you're supposed to get the
same answer, no matter what you

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:03.288
do, including going like this,
or anything else.

00:21:03.288 --> 00:21:06.759
How can they all give the same
answer?

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:10.795
In fact, I'll give you a simple
example where it's simply not

00:21:10.795 --> 00:21:13.618
true, so the answer depends on
the path.

00:21:13.618 --> 00:21:17.131
In fact, just about any force
you pick randomly will not have

00:21:17.131 --> 00:21:19.588
the property,
the answer does not depend on

00:21:19.588 --> 00:21:20.348
the path.
 

00:21:20.348 --> 00:21:23.769
Answers typically will depend
on what path you take.

00:21:23.769 --> 00:21:28.808
So let's take a simple force,
F =

00:21:28.808 --> 00:21:31.568
iy.
 

00:21:31.568 --> 00:21:34.448
I can think of more complicated
ones, but I don't have time to

00:21:34.448 --> 00:21:34.920
do them.
 

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.650
So here's a simple one - force
depends on position.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.675
It points in the x
direction only and it grows with

00:21:40.675 --> 00:21:41.259
y.
 

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.480
And I'm going to do two
calculations.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:48.065
I'm going to find the integral
from the origin to the point

00:21:48.065 --> 00:21:52.730
(1,1) first by going this way
and then by going that way.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:54.690
They are two possible paths.
 

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.824
And you will see,
when I do the calculation,

00:21:57.824 --> 00:21:59.720
the answer is different.
 

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.922
Therefore you cannot write the
answer as a difference of

00:22:02.922 --> 00:22:06.082
something here - something here,
because the answer is not a

00:22:06.082 --> 00:22:08.160
function only of the starting
and ending points,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.930
but how you got there.
 

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:15.487
And I want to do this just to
remind you how to do these

00:22:15.487 --> 00:22:16.700
integrals.
 

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:22.000
So let's take this segment here.
 

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.700
What is the work done?
 

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:29.088
The work is the force which is
i times y times

00:22:29.088 --> 00:22:30.460
the distance.
 

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.428
If you move horizontally,
perhaps you guys can see

00:22:34.428 --> 00:22:39.529
dr for a tiny segment
simply i times dx.

00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:42.609
And x goes from 0 to 1.
 

00:22:42.609 --> 00:22:47.789
So how much is that?
 

00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:50.269
Can you do this?
 

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:51.930
I want the first person who
knows the answer.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:52.529
Yes?
 

00:22:52.529 --> 00:22:55.130
Student:  Zero
______________.

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.619
Prof: Right.
 

00:22:55.619 --> 00:22:58.538
On this line, y is 0.
 

00:22:58.538 --> 00:23:00.441
In fact, if you draw a picture
of the force,

00:23:00.441 --> 00:23:01.368
it looks like this.
 

00:23:01.368 --> 00:23:04.500
It gets bigger and bigger and
bigger as you go further off.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.980
And if you go to negative
values, it looks like this.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.319
So there is no y,
there is no force.

00:23:09.319 --> 00:23:11.660
That is 0.
 

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.132
If you go to this segment,
y is definitely

00:23:15.132 --> 00:23:17.454
non-zero,
but notice, the force is like

00:23:17.454 --> 00:23:20.266
this and the dr is in the
y direction and they are

00:23:20.266 --> 00:23:24.660
perpendicular,
so the dot product is 0.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.630
Okay?
 

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.108
dr and F are
perpendicular.

00:23:28.108 --> 00:23:31.000
One is along i and one
is along j dot product to

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.190
0.
 

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:35.130
If you take this path,
the work done is 0.

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:38.924
Now let's take the other path,
go like this and then like

00:23:38.924 --> 00:23:39.400
this.
 

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.720
On this section,
we have the same problem.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.779
Force is to the right.
 

00:23:42.779 --> 00:23:44.140
You're moving straight up.
 

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.269
dr and F are
perpendicular.

00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:50.368
But on the last segment,
from here to here,

00:23:50.368 --> 00:23:52.375
you get a non-zero
contribution,

00:23:52.375 --> 00:23:54.769
because force is
iy,

00:23:54.769 --> 00:23:58.930
displacement is
idx and x

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.846
goes from 0 to 1,
and y is frozen at the

00:24:02.846 --> 00:24:05.690
value 1,
because you're on this line.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:06.930
Frozen at the value 1.
 

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.240
Just put 1 for it.
 

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.338
And i⋅i is
1, integral of dx is 1.

00:24:12.338 --> 00:24:15.709
Therefore the work done by the
force going up and then to the

00:24:15.709 --> 00:24:16.440
right is 1.
 

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.318
Going to the right and then up
is 0.

00:24:20.318 --> 00:24:23.598
You can take other paths and
keep getting other answers.

00:24:23.598 --> 00:24:25.519
So this is a force for which
it's not true,

00:24:25.519 --> 00:24:29.172
and I bet you that if you just
randomly selected forces in the

00:24:29.172 --> 00:24:32.355
2 dimensional plane,
they will never have the

00:24:32.355 --> 00:24:35.970
property that the integral is
path independent.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.733
So it looks like we are onto a
hopeless task,

00:24:39.733 --> 00:24:43.500
that the answer cannot depend
on the path.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.635
So maybe there is no problem in
which you can derive a law of

00:24:47.635 --> 00:24:49.358
conservation of energy.
 

00:24:49.358 --> 00:24:53.555
Of course, you guys know,
you can derive a law of

00:24:53.555 --> 00:24:57.750
conservation of energy for a
family of forces.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.291
In fact, the answer is,
there's an infinite of numbers

00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:02.740
of forces you can devise for
which this is true,

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.910
namely, the answer does not
depend on the path.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.348
Before writing those forces,
let me explain to you one other

00:25:10.348 --> 00:25:12.038
way to write the condition.
 

00:25:12.038 --> 00:25:15.980
The condition,
namely of a conservative force,

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.530
is that the integral from here
to here is the same as the

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:23.212
integral from there to there,
from 1 to 2 along path A

00:25:23.212 --> 00:25:26.538
and 1 to 2 along path B.
 

00:25:26.538 --> 00:25:30.570
They must be equal for any
starting point and any ending

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.430
point and any two paths joining
them.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:39.925
So what I'm saying is,
F⋅dr from 1

00:25:39.925 --> 00:25:47.421
to 2 along A = integral
F⋅dr from 1

00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:50.420
to 2 along B.
 

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:56.203
Let me rewrite this by putting
a - sign here and equate it to

00:25:56.203 --> 00:25:56.589
0.
 

00:25:56.589 --> 00:25:57.318
That's fine.
 

00:25:57.318 --> 00:26:00.390
Shifted it to the left hand
side.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:04.220
But then we use the fact that
when you go from 1 to 2,

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:09.034
with a - sign,
this second guy is same as from

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:14.490
2 to 1 along B of
F⋅dr.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.939
In other words,
the line integral going this

00:26:16.939 --> 00:26:19.558
way is - the line integral going
backwards,

00:26:19.558 --> 00:26:22.141
because at every step,
dr is opposite but F

00:26:22.141 --> 00:26:25.690
is the same at the point,
F⋅dr changes

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:26.068
sign.
 

00:26:26.068 --> 00:26:30.670
Therefore it tells you then
that the line integral from here

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:32.618
to there and back is 0.
 

00:26:32.618 --> 00:26:36.275
We write that by saying the
line integral of

00:26:36.275 --> 00:26:41.630
F⋅dr in a
closed path is 0 for all paths,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.470
for all starting points,
all ending points,

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:44.779
all paths.
 

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:49.109
And that is the force that we
want.

00:26:49.109 --> 00:26:52.579
That's the conservative force.
 

00:26:52.579 --> 00:26:53.690
I've just rewritten.
 

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.817
I've not gotten any closer to
finding conservative force,

00:26:56.817 --> 00:26:59.500
but I'm saying there are two
ways to write it.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.878
Answer doesn't depend on the
path, or the answer on any

00:27:02.878 --> 00:27:05.945
closed loop, the line integral
on any closed loop,

00:27:05.945 --> 00:27:06.509
is 0.
 

00:27:06.509 --> 00:27:11.922
That means sometimes it's got
to be positive,

00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:16.348
sometimes it's got to be
negative.

00:27:16.348 --> 00:27:19.232
So question is,
where am I going to get a force

00:27:19.232 --> 00:27:21.240
with these amazing properties?
 

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.769
And I'm just going to give you
the answer.

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:27.739
The theorem--if you want,
you can call it a theorem,

00:27:27.739 --> 00:27:29.130
you can call it whatever you
like.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.518
It's a fact--number 1,
here is a recipe for finding

00:27:33.518 --> 00:27:35.450
conservative forces.
 

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:46.358
Take any function
U(x,y).

00:27:46.358 --> 00:27:47.858
I'm just going to do it in 2
dimensions.

00:27:47.858 --> 00:27:50.981
In 3 dimensions,
you can make it

00:27:50.981 --> 00:27:53.500
U(x,y,z).
 

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:54.990
So let's give an example here.
 

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:59.970
U = x^(3)y^(2).
 

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:00.799
Take that function.
 

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:01.848
You can write your own ticket.
 

00:28:01.848 --> 00:28:04.319
Write whatever function you
want, time hyperbolic

00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:06.122
sinh(y) times
cosh(x),

00:28:06.122 --> 00:28:07.099
doesn't matter.
 

00:28:07.099 --> 00:28:08.910
Take a function.
 

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.825
Then the force that I want is
the property that

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:18.740
F_x =
-dU/dx and

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:23.868
F_y =
-dU/dy.

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:25.656
In other words,
I'm going to manufacture a

00:28:25.656 --> 00:28:28.316
force whose x component
is - the x derivative of

00:28:28.316 --> 00:28:30.756
the function I picked and the
y component is - the

00:28:30.756 --> 00:28:32.980
y derivative of the
function I picked.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.923
So in my example,
F_x will be

00:28:35.923 --> 00:28:39.324
-x derivative partial
means keep y as a

00:28:39.324 --> 00:28:41.182
constant,
take the derivative with

00:28:41.182 --> 00:28:42.009
respect to x.
 

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:48.960
That's 3x^(2)y and
F_y will be

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.190
-2x^(3).
 

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:58.588
3x^(2)y^(2) and
-2x^(3)y.

00:28:58.588 --> 00:29:02.785
Let me see if I got that right,
because you guys have been

00:29:02.785 --> 00:29:04.920
catching me too many times.
 

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:09.798
Okay, I think that's all right.
 

00:29:09.798 --> 00:29:14.920
This force is guaranteed to be
conservative.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.349
I will show you why this is
true.

00:29:16.349 --> 00:29:18.690
Why is this magic working?
 

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:23.180
But let me write it in another
way that's more compact.

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.048
So the force I want to get,
written as a vector,

00:29:26.048 --> 00:29:27.338
is i times
F_x,

00:29:27.338 --> 00:29:30.963
which is i times
−du/dx

00:29:30.963 --> 00:29:34.220
j times
−du/dy.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.910
That's the force I claim is
conservative.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:41.660
We're going to write that as -
grad U.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.365
This is called the grad and it
means gradient,

00:29:45.365 --> 00:29:48.660
and this symbol is shorthand
for this.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:53.220
There's nothing more to it.
 

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:55.190
Gradient is a machine.
 

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:56.348
Derivative is a machine.
 

00:29:56.348 --> 00:29:58.122
You give it a function,
sin x,

00:29:58.122 --> 00:30:00.190
it gives you an output,
cosine x.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.519
you give it x squared,
it gives you 2x.

00:30:02.519 --> 00:30:04.700
Gradient is a different kind of
machine.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:06.714
You feed into it a function
U of x and

00:30:06.714 --> 00:30:08.866
y,
and it gives you a vector in

00:30:08.866 --> 00:30:11.980
all of the xy plane
obtained by taking the two

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.046
derivatives,
one along x and one

00:30:14.046 --> 00:30:17.223
along y,
and assembling them into a

00:30:17.223 --> 00:30:18.640
single vector.
 

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.910
So let's see for this
particular U,

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:29.069
the force we have = -i
times 3x^(2)y^(2),

00:30:29.069 --> 00:30:34.098
-j times 2x^(3)y.
 

00:30:34.098 --> 00:30:36.917
Amazingly, it is claimed that
this force, when you integrate

00:30:36.917 --> 00:30:39.690
it from one point to another,
answer will not depend on the

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.938
path;
it will depend only on the end

00:30:42.938 --> 00:30:43.690
points.
 

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.598
So we have to understand what
makes this work.

00:30:47.598 --> 00:30:51.298
Before I show that,
I will make another statement.

00:30:51.298 --> 00:30:58.161
I will show you why this works,
but the second statement,

00:30:58.161 --> 00:31:03.921
I will not prove,
which is that all conservative

00:31:03.921 --> 00:31:09.190
forces are of the form - grad
U.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.094
In other words,
not only is this an example of

00:31:12.094 --> 00:31:14.160
conservative force,
that's it.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:16.160
There are no more examples.
 

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.500
Every conservative force you
cook up will always be--yes?

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:24.740
Student:  Does the
j component ___________?

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.640
Prof: j component
should be what?

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.480
Oh, that's negative.
 

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.740
I think I erased it.
 

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.859
How's that?
 

00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:33.759
Thank you.
 

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:34.880
Is that what you meant?
 

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.839
Student:  Yes.
 

00:31:35.839 --> 00:31:38.470
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.789
So how are you guys doing with
this?

00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:44.150
I'm always worried.
 

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.885
You are inscrutable,
and I don't know what's going

00:31:47.885 --> 00:31:50.365
on in there,
whether silence means "I'm

00:31:50.365 --> 00:31:51.828
with you"
or silence means,

00:31:51.828 --> 00:31:54.300
"I'm so far behind,
I don't even know where to

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:56.180
start telling you my
problems."

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.519
I don't know.
 

00:31:57.519 --> 00:31:58.940
But this is your class.
 

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:01.789
If you don't speak up,
you don't get service.

00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:03.308
You have to ask.
 

00:32:03.308 --> 00:32:05.170
Don't assume people next to you
know anything.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:05.829
I've met them.
 

00:32:05.829 --> 00:32:08.180
They don't.
 

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:11.670
So just speak up.
 

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:13.210
All right.
 

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:16.400
So it's like one of these
psychotherapy sessions.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.752
Turn to the person next to you
and insult him or her,

00:32:19.752 --> 00:32:22.140
because that's what you want to
do.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.420
Don't worry about them, okay.
 

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:29.154
When you go to physics seminar,
you never assume the speaker

00:32:29.154 --> 00:32:30.440
has a problem.
 

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.460
I mean, you assume that you
don't have a problem.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.627
If you don't follow it,
it's a problem with the

00:32:34.627 --> 00:32:35.098
speaker.
 

00:32:35.098 --> 00:32:38.019
That's what makes seminars
exciting.

00:32:38.019 --> 00:32:41.073
It's the closest thing we have
to gladiator fights in the old

00:32:41.073 --> 00:32:41.430
days.
 

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:44.078
You bring a speaker from
somewhere, maybe Harvard,

00:32:44.078 --> 00:32:47.377
then you put them on the stage
and you just roast them for the

00:32:47.377 --> 00:32:48.190
whole hour.
 

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:50.772
Now you can do that to me just
fine, because this is not even

00:32:50.772 --> 00:32:51.420
my discovery.
 

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:54.430
Somebody else did it hundreds
of years ago.

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.470
You should relish that
challenge.

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.890
If this was a small seminar,
you will have time to do it.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.432
I don't have that much time,
but I also don't have that

00:33:03.432 --> 00:33:07.630
little time that if you don't
follow me, you cannot intervene.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.869
Okay, you have a question?
 

00:33:09.869 --> 00:33:11.319
No.
 

00:33:11.319 --> 00:33:12.259
Okay.
 

00:33:12.259 --> 00:33:17.443
Now we are going to understand
why a force manufactured in this

00:33:17.443 --> 00:33:20.119
fashion is conservative,
okay?

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:24.535
So let's calculate integral
F⋅dr for

00:33:24.535 --> 00:33:28.359
this force from some
starting--I'm just going to call

00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:29.390
it 1 and 2.
 

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.480
It means r_1
and r_2.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.298
What is F⋅dr?
 

00:33:34.298 --> 00:33:39.690
It is F_xdx
F_ydy.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:41.180
That's the meaning of the dot
product.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.400
I hope you know what I mean by
this.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.875
I'm going from here to here,
that vector dr is some

00:33:47.875 --> 00:33:51.880
amount of dx and some
amount of dy.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:57.000
It's got jdy and
idx.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.727
And F is some other
thing, pointing in that

00:33:59.727 --> 00:34:02.400
direction, so
F⋅dr is this.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.369
Just look at this part.
 

00:34:04.369 --> 00:34:06.150
This is what you're integrating.
 

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:10.574
That becomes,
except for this - sign,

00:34:10.574 --> 00:34:17.210
dU/dx times
dx dU/dy

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.670
times dy.
 

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:22.719
Now what is that?
 

00:34:22.719 --> 00:34:24.230
What is that?
 

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:30.000
What do you think it stands for?
 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.762
In 1 dimension,
if I took df/dx

00:34:34.762 --> 00:34:39.199
times dx,
what am I calculating?

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.643
Come on guys,
you know what the derivative

00:34:41.643 --> 00:34:42.119
means.
 

00:34:42.119 --> 00:34:47.391
When you multiply the
derivative by some dx,

00:34:47.391 --> 00:34:49.289
what do you get?
 

00:34:49.289 --> 00:34:49.789
Pardon me?
 

00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:51.190
Yes, go ahead.
 

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.099
Take a shot.
 

00:34:52.099 --> 00:34:53.300
Yeah.
 

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.929
Student:  You're getting
what you originally ___________.

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:00.177
Prof: You're finding the
change in the function f,

00:35:00.177 --> 00:35:00.590
right?
 

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:06.289
The change in the function
f is df/dx

00:35:06.289 --> 00:35:08.090
times dx.
 

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:11.019
There are other changes
proportional to dx^(3)

00:35:11.019 --> 00:35:13.385
and dx^(2),
but for small dx,

00:35:13.385 --> 00:35:14.570
that's all it is.
 

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.329
That's the meaning of the rate
of change.

00:35:16.329 --> 00:35:20.228
If you multiply the rate of
change by the change you get a

00:35:20.228 --> 00:35:21.940
change in the function.
 

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.106
If you're in 2 dimensions,
if you move from one point to

00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:27.639
another point,
you've got a function U

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:30.230
that depends on x and on
y.

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:32.952
Therefore it changes,
because you change x and

00:35:32.952 --> 00:35:35.099
it changes because you change
y.

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:37.260
It's changing because of two
reasons.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.929
This is the change due to
change in x;

00:35:38.929 --> 00:35:41.349
that's the change due to change
in y.

00:35:41.349 --> 00:35:44.114
For very small,
infinitesimal dx and

00:35:44.114 --> 00:35:46.219
dy, that is the change.
 

00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:54.409
That is just the change in the
function U.

00:35:54.409 --> 00:35:57.239
It follows then that if you add
up all these

00:35:57.239 --> 00:36:03.489
F⋅dr's from
1 to 2, this integral will give

00:36:03.489 --> 00:36:08.510
me U_1 -
U_2.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:15.530
Therefore integral
F⋅dr from 1

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:23.429
to 2 is U_1 -
U_2.

00:36:23.429 --> 00:36:26.503
So the magic is the following -
you pick a function U,

00:36:26.503 --> 00:36:29.014
you can think of the function
U as measured

00:36:29.014 --> 00:36:30.860
perpendicular to the blackboard.
 

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.849
It's like a height or something
coming out of the blackboard.

00:36:33.849 --> 00:36:37.447
You cooked up a force which is
related to the rate of change of

00:36:37.447 --> 00:36:39.757
the function U,
so that if you add all the

00:36:39.757 --> 00:36:42.597
F⋅dr`s,
you're getting the change in

00:36:42.597 --> 00:36:44.860
the function between two points.
 

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.414
And that change in the function
is independent of how you got

00:36:48.414 --> 00:36:48.889
there.
 

00:36:48.889 --> 00:36:51.650
Think of U as a height
of a mountain,

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.219
sitting on top of the xy
plane.

00:36:54.219 --> 00:36:56.516
Then F is really
proportional to the rate of

00:36:56.516 --> 00:36:58.309
change of the height of the
mountain.

00:36:58.309 --> 00:37:00.644
And F⋅dr is
the change when you move a

00:37:00.644 --> 00:37:02.730
distance dr,
a vector distance dr.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:05.250
You add all the changes,
what are you adding?

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.679
You're adding the height,
your elevation.

00:37:07.679 --> 00:37:10.197
And when you're done,
the total change is the height

00:37:10.197 --> 00:37:13.159
difference between the final
point and the starting point.

00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:15.659
It doesn't depend on how you
climb that mountain.

00:37:15.659 --> 00:37:18.018
You can take a long path,
you can take a short path.

00:37:18.018 --> 00:37:22.304
As long as you're keeping track
of how many feet have I climbed,

00:37:22.304 --> 00:37:24.889
you're going to get only one
answer.

00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:28.172
So not every F has this
property, but an F

00:37:28.172 --> 00:37:31.815
derived from U by that
trick of taking the gradient has

00:37:31.815 --> 00:37:32.889
this property.
 

00:37:32.889 --> 00:37:38.061
Therefore for that F,
you might say this is for

00:37:38.061 --> 00:37:40.110
conservative force.
 

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:41.840
But we always knew
F⋅dr is

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.690
K_2 -
K_1,

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.818
therefore we get
K_1

00:37:46.818 --> 00:37:50.556
U_1 =
K_2 

00:37:50.556 --> 00:37:52.730
U_2.
 

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.150
In other words,
the U that you began

00:37:56.150 --> 00:38:00.059
with is the potential energy for
that problem.

00:38:00.059 --> 00:38:04.670
So what you're manufacturing is
pairs of potentials and forces.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:07.280
For every U that you
dream up, there's a force,

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.039
which is obtained by gradient,
- gradient of U.

00:38:10.039 --> 00:38:13.034
And in that problem,
where that force is acting on

00:38:13.034 --> 00:38:15.067
particles,
the energy that is conserved

00:38:15.067 --> 00:38:18.148
will be the kinetic,
the function U at the

00:38:18.148 --> 00:38:22.385
starting point,
will be equal to kinetic plus

00:38:22.385 --> 00:38:25.239
potential at the end point.
 

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:29.061
And the interesting thing is,
there are no other conservative

00:38:29.061 --> 00:38:32.690
forces, except forces you can
get by taking a U and

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.219
taking its gradient.
 

00:38:34.219 --> 00:38:38.119
So all conservative forces fall
under this category,

00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:42.387
and they all have a conserved
quantity where the potential

00:38:42.387 --> 00:38:46.880
energy is the U from
which the F is derived.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.956
So we can say it as follows -
F = - gradient of

00:38:51.956 --> 00:38:53.010
U.
 

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:55.543
The gradient is the combination
of i times the x

00:38:55.543 --> 00:38:57.364
derivative and j
times the y

00:38:57.364 --> 00:38:58.210
derivative.
 

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:03.811
And U at 2 - U at
1 is - integral

00:39:03.811 --> 00:39:08.440
F⋅dr from 1
to 2.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:13.472
This is the 2 dimensional
generalization of something I

00:39:13.472 --> 00:39:16.550
wrote in 1 dimension somewhere.
 

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.449
Oh, way on the top.
 

00:39:18.449 --> 00:39:20.356
Here, F = - dU
/dx,

00:39:20.356 --> 00:39:22.166
U(x_2)
−

00:39:22.166 --> 00:39:25.150
U(x_1)
is - integral of F.

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:28.840
The only difference is the
integrand has become this

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.663
F⋅dr,
rather than the

00:39:31.663 --> 00:39:33.690
F_x dx.
 

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:37.000
So you can get conservation of
energy in higher dimensions for

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.280
those forces that come from a
potential.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:43.949
U is called a potential.
 

00:39:43.949 --> 00:39:53.199
U is called a potential
energy.

00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:59.355
So now we can ask the following
question - suppose I give you a

00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:00.150
force.
 

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:02.329
I know if it's conservative or
not.

00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:06.090
How are you going to find out?
 

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:06.940
Now there are two options.
 

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.623
One is, you are so smart,
you can look at the function

00:40:09.623 --> 00:40:12.114
and say,
"Hey, this is the gradient

00:40:12.114 --> 00:40:14.550
of some other function
U."

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:15.713
If you do that,
then you are done,

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:17.300
because if it's the gradient of
some function,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.360
we know it's conservative.
 

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.599
But what if you cannot see that
right away?

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.820
With simple polynomials,
you can easily guess.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.403
Like the example I gave you,
if F_x is

00:40:26.403 --> 00:40:28.898
-3x^(2)y^(2),
F_y is

00:40:28.898 --> 00:40:31.574
-2x^(3)y,
maybe you can guess that U

00:40:31.574 --> 00:40:33.309
is x^(3)y^(2).
 

00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:36.601
But for more complicated
functions, you won't be able to

00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:37.079
do it.
 

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:40.668
So there's a process for
testing any force to see if it's

00:40:40.668 --> 00:40:41.630
conservative.
 

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.429
And the process is the
following.

00:40:43.429 --> 00:40:46.554
It argues as follows -
F_x is

00:40:46.554 --> 00:40:48.570
−dU/dx.
 

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:53.849
F_y is
-dU/dy.

00:40:53.849 --> 00:40:56.967
Then consider
dF_x /

00:40:56.967 --> 00:41:01.210
dy, which is
-d^(2)U/dydx.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.945
Then consider
dF_y /

00:41:03.945 --> 00:41:07.670
dx, which is
-d^(2)U/dxdy.

00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:10.420
And it's the property of
partial derivatives that the

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.914
cross derivative,
second cross derivative,

00:41:13.914 --> 00:41:20.309
is independent of whether you
take dydx or dxdy.

00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:28.420
So let's go to our test case,
U = x^(3)y^(2).

00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:34.083
dU/dx =
3x^(2)y^(2) and

00:41:34.083 --> 00:41:39.219
dU/dy =
2x^(3)y.

00:41:39.219 --> 00:41:41.242
Now I'm saying,
take the x derivative of

00:41:41.242 --> 00:41:42.429
this y derivative.
 

00:41:42.429 --> 00:41:46.039
That's written as
d^(2)U/dydx.

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:49.210
y derivative of the
x derivative gives me

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:50.210
6x^(2)y.
 

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.860
Then I say take the x
derivative of the y

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.500
derivative.
 

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.940
This gives me 3x^(2).
 

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:01.110
That means 6x^(2)y.
 

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.280
So cross derivatives are always
equal.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.268
Yes?
 

00:42:04.268 --> 00:42:05.846
Student:  Is this
_______ if we're going ________

00:42:05.846 --> 00:42:06.420
taking __________?
 

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.840
Prof: Yes,
that's correct.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.146
So in 2 dimensions,
this is the only test you have

00:42:12.146 --> 00:42:12.889
to apply.
 

00:42:12.889 --> 00:42:16.469
The test you have to apply is,
are the cross derivatives of

00:42:16.469 --> 00:42:17.579
the force equal?
 

00:42:17.579 --> 00:42:19.824
Namely, is the y
derivative of the force

00:42:19.824 --> 00:42:22.119
F_x = to x
derivative of

00:42:22.119 --> 00:42:23.340
F_y?
 

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:28.967
You want to see if
dF_x/dy

00:42:28.967 --> 00:42:32.300
= dF_y/dx.
 

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.630
If that is true,
it is conservative.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:37.893
And it comes from the fact that
if F is the derivative of

00:42:37.893 --> 00:42:41.054
some function U,
then this mix derivative being

00:42:41.054 --> 00:42:42.989
equal is a diagnostic for that.
 

00:42:42.989 --> 00:42:46.030
In 3 dimensions,
there are 2 more equations.

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:48.525
We're not going to use them,
but I'll just mention what they

00:42:48.525 --> 00:42:48.780
are.
 

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.690
You get that by moving every
index 1 notch.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.396
So this x goes to
y, this y goes to

00:42:54.396 --> 00:42:57.449
z, this y goes to
z, this x goes to

00:42:57.449 --> 00:42:58.090
y.
 

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.800
There's one more condition.
 

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.829
And another condition,
z goes back to x,

00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:07.239
x goes z--let's
see, y goes to z,

00:43:07.239 --> 00:43:11.103
z goes to x =
dF_x/

00:43:11.103 --> 00:43:12.050
dz.
 

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:15.744
I'm not worried about whether
you write this down or not,

00:43:15.744 --> 00:43:19.835
but I do want you to know in 2
dimensions, you have to remember

00:43:19.835 --> 00:43:21.090
this condition.
 

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:25.795
So this mathematic extends to
all dimensions,

00:43:25.795 --> 00:43:29.860
but I'm doing it for the case
of 2D.

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:33.809
So let's take stock of what has
been done.

00:43:33.809 --> 00:43:38.068
What has been done is to think
from scratch on how to get the

00:43:38.068 --> 00:43:41.690
law of conservation of energy in
high dimensions.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.679
You start with the kinetic
energy and you ask,

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:44.610
why does it change?
 

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:47.554
And you find it changes due to
the force, and you find the

00:43:47.554 --> 00:43:50.190
change in kinetic energy is the
line integral of

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:53.119
F⋅dr from
start to finish.

00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:56.079
But that doesn't give you a
work energy--

00:43:56.079 --> 00:43:57.909
it gives you a work energy
theorem,

00:43:57.909 --> 00:43:59.590
but not a law of conservation
of energy,

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.760
because this integral can
depend on the path.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.864
Then you say,
maybe there are some functions

00:44:04.864 --> 00:44:07.510
for which the answer depends
only on the end points.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:09.469
Then we get a law of
conservation of energy,

00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:13.626
and we found out that we can
manufacture such functions at

00:44:13.626 --> 00:44:15.411
will,
by taking any function of

00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:18.878
U,
taking its gradient,

00:44:18.878 --> 00:44:21.670
or - the gradient.
 

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:25.222
Therefore that's a way to
generate conservative forces and

00:44:25.222 --> 00:44:28.340
they are the only conservative
forces there are.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.963
There's no other conservative
forces which are not gradients

00:44:30.963 --> 00:44:31.630
of something.
 

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.481
And the relation between the
potential and the force,

00:44:34.481 --> 00:44:35.690
you should know now.
 

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.119
It's what you learned in 1D,
suitably generalized to higher

00:44:39.119 --> 00:44:39.889
dimensions.
 

00:44:39.889 --> 00:44:43.523
Change in potential is this and
the forces obtained from the

00:44:43.523 --> 00:44:45.739
potential by taking the
gradient,

00:44:45.739 --> 00:44:50.449
the change in potential is
obtained by integrating the

00:44:50.449 --> 00:44:51.159
force.
 

00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:53.780
If you ever get confused about
sign and - sign and so on,

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.760
go back to the harmonic
oscillator,

00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:06.710
for which the thing is 1
over--is kx^(2)/2.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:13.655
So let me give you one simple
example that we all know,

00:45:13.655 --> 00:45:19.699
which is the force of gravity
near the earth.

00:45:19.699 --> 00:45:25.414
So here is the earth,
so there is some x and

00:45:25.414 --> 00:45:30.559
y coordinates,
and here is z.

00:45:30.559 --> 00:45:33.893
So I might as well write down
the answer, because you guys all

00:45:33.893 --> 00:45:34.550
know this.
 

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:41.637
U for gravity is
mg times z. And

00:45:41.637 --> 00:45:45.677
the force of gravity,
which is

00:45:45.677 --> 00:45:51.539
-idu/dx -
jdu/dy,

00:45:51.539 --> 00:45:56.556
- kdu/dz,
all you got here is

00:45:56.556 --> 00:45:59.728
-kmg,
because it doesn't depend on

00:45:59.728 --> 00:46:01.400
x,
it doesn't depend on y.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.670
It depends only on z and
the z derivative is

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:04.070
trivial.
 

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:11.400
Force is -mg pointing
down.

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.599
So the force is the gradient of
the potential and you can ask,

00:46:14.599 --> 00:46:17.780
is the potential difference
between two points,

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.610
U_2 -
U_1,

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:26.280
is it equal to integral of
F⋅dr from 1

00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:26.989
to 2?
 

00:46:26.989 --> 00:46:28.570
You can easily check that.
 

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:34.255
If you go from here to here,
straight up,

00:46:34.255 --> 00:46:42.784
then the integral of -mg
times dz from start to

00:46:42.784 --> 00:46:49.750
finish, with a - sign is just
mgz - 0.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.440
So indeed, it is true.
 

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.610
And if you took two points,
not on top of each other,

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:56.280
but something like this,
you can always do the integral

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.523
from here to here,
where there's no change in

00:46:58.523 --> 00:47:00.722
potential,
and do the integral there,

00:47:00.722 --> 00:47:02.809
which will give the same
answer.

00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:06.581
So gravity's a very trivial
example, a very easy case,

00:47:06.581 --> 00:47:10.068
but you can see that
gravitation is a conservative

00:47:10.068 --> 00:47:10.780
force.
 

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:12.630
And you can see why it's a
conservative force,

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:16.659
because if you took a path
where you went like this,

00:47:16.659 --> 00:47:20.347
let's say, and you went like
this, where you get the same

00:47:20.347 --> 00:47:22.059
answer as here and here.
 

00:47:22.059 --> 00:47:26.074
Because in this path and this
path, you don't do any work,

00:47:26.074 --> 00:47:29.454
because F and dr
are perpendicular,

00:47:29.454 --> 00:47:30.159
right?
 

00:47:30.159 --> 00:47:32.193
F is like this,
and the displacement is like

00:47:32.193 --> 00:47:34.101
that,
and it's the same thing,

00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:36.541
whereas here,
if you go like this,

00:47:36.541 --> 00:47:39.518
F is down and dr
is down,

00:47:39.518 --> 00:47:41.210
F is down,
dr is down,

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:43.969
and it's the same F here
and here;

00:47:43.969 --> 00:47:48.400
are the same height so you get
the same answer.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.483
Okay, but now,
why did we spend quite a bit of

00:47:52.483 --> 00:47:57.474
time on conservative forces,
because that's not what the

00:47:57.474 --> 00:47:59.380
primary focus is?
 

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.860
It was electricity and
electrostatics.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:06.025
So we've got to ask ourselves,
does the electrostatic force

00:48:06.025 --> 00:48:08.900
meet the test of a conservative
force?

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.619
Well, we know it will,
because otherwise I wouldn't

00:48:11.619 --> 00:48:14.340
have spent this much time
building up the stuff.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.809
But let's just verify that.
 

00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:20.469
It looks like a very formidable
task.

00:48:20.469 --> 00:48:23.268
Let's see why it's a formidable
task to verify it's

00:48:23.268 --> 00:48:24.110
conservative.
 

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:27.797
I'm claiming that you've got
all kinds of these charges

00:48:27.797 --> 00:48:31.556
producing a field here and I
want to prove that the line

00:48:31.556 --> 00:48:35.039
integral of this force on any
closed loop is 0.

00:48:35.039 --> 00:48:39.373
Or I want to prove the integral
on one path is the integral on

00:48:39.373 --> 00:48:42.498
any other path,
for any 2 paths between any 2

00:48:42.498 --> 00:48:43.280
points.
 

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.650
I don't have time to show all
that, right?

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:51.750
If the theorem is wrong,
do you agree it may not be so

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:52.920
hard to show that?
 

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.039
What will it take to show it is
not conservative?

00:48:56.039 --> 00:48:57.159
Yes?
 

00:48:57.159 --> 00:48:59.119
Student:  Just 2 paths
for which the integral is not

00:48:59.119 --> 00:48:59.389
equal.
 

00:48:59.389 --> 00:48:59.909
Prof: Yes.
 

00:48:59.909 --> 00:49:03.543
If you pick any 2 paths,
should be the same end points,

00:49:03.543 --> 00:49:06.840
so always the integral is not
equal, that's it.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.818
But the fact that they were
equal doesn't mean that somebody

00:49:09.818 --> 00:49:12.547
else will not find some other
two paths with some other

00:49:12.547 --> 00:49:14.820
starting points which they are
not equal.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.250
So how are we going to do this?
 

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:20.233
How are we going to test for
every configuration of electric

00:49:20.233 --> 00:49:23.610
field, every element of charges
is conservative?

00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:31.909
So what do you think a strategy
will be?

00:49:31.909 --> 00:49:32.900
Yes?
 

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.309
Any ideas?
 

00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:36.827
How am I going to take all
possible charges and work it out

00:49:36.827 --> 00:49:37.349
each time?
 

00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:38.179
Yes?
 

00:49:38.179 --> 00:49:40.710
Student:  I guess you
could find the electric field

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.489
and use that test to see--
Prof: Right,

00:49:42.489 --> 00:49:44.409
but to find the electric field
and see if it works,

00:49:44.409 --> 00:49:46.592
you have to calculate the
electric field as a function of

00:49:46.592 --> 00:49:48.733
x,
y and z for every

00:49:48.733 --> 00:49:50.030
arrangement of charges.
 

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:51.847
Then you can ask,
is that true,

00:49:51.847 --> 00:49:53.059
those derivatives?
 

00:49:53.059 --> 00:49:53.650
Yes?
 

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:55.144
Student:  But what works
for one charge should work for

00:49:55.144 --> 00:49:56.150
all charges, because of
supersposition.

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:57.268
Prof: There we go.
 

00:49:57.268 --> 00:50:01.630
If it works for one charge,
it will work for any

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:03.949
arrangement of charges.
 

00:50:03.949 --> 00:50:05.909
So you may not have appreciated
fully the power of

00:50:05.909 --> 00:50:07.389
superposition,
but you can see now.

00:50:07.389 --> 00:50:09.704
If you did not realize that,
the problem looks

00:50:09.704 --> 00:50:10.579
insurmountable.
 

00:50:10.579 --> 00:50:13.010
Who can handle every
arrangement of charges?

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:16.467
But if charge by charge it is
true that the electric field due

00:50:16.467 --> 00:50:19.755
to charge 1 is conservative,
electric field due to charge 2

00:50:19.755 --> 00:50:20.889
is conservative.
 

00:50:20.889 --> 00:50:22.510
When I add them up,
the net field is

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:24.550
E_1
E_2.

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.327
The line integral of
E_1 E_2

00:50:26.327 --> 00:50:28.351
is the line integral
of E_1_

00:50:28.351 --> 00:50:30.199
 the line integral of
E_2.

00:50:30.199 --> 00:50:32.543
E_1 gives 0 on
any closed loop,

00:50:32.543 --> 00:50:34.489
other will give 0 on any closed
loop.

00:50:34.489 --> 00:50:36.909
The trick is going to be just
do it for one charge.

00:50:36.909 --> 00:50:38.119
That's it.
 

00:50:38.119 --> 00:50:41.159
If you can see it for one
charge, you get by superposition

00:50:41.159 --> 00:50:45.143
that it's true for any charge,
because the field is additive

00:50:45.143 --> 00:50:48.119
and the integral is additive,
okay.

00:50:48.119 --> 00:50:49.469
That's the two parts.
 

00:50:49.469 --> 00:50:51.327
If you've got charges,
the net e is

00:50:51.327 --> 00:50:53.320
E_1
E_2.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.943
The integral of
E_1 E_2

00:50:54.943 --> 00:50:56.777
is the integral of
E_1 the

00:50:56.777 --> 00:50:58.119
integral of
E_2.

00:50:58.119 --> 00:50:59.530
That's the way integrals work.
 

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.579
If each one vanishes on a
closed loop, you're done.

00:51:02.579 --> 00:51:04.179
So I'm just going to take one
charge.

00:51:04.179 --> 00:51:10.610
Here's one charge and let me
draw for convenience all the

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:14.170
field lines coming out of it.
 

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.391
Then I want to see,
if I do a line integral,

00:51:17.391 --> 00:51:21.210
say from here to here,
will I get the same answer on

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:22.710
some other path?
 

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:26.329
Let's test that.
 

00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:29.780
So the first integral is from 1
to 2 on this path.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.670
Then I'm going to take another
one,

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.222
which is different from it,
where you can see the answer is

00:51:34.222 --> 00:51:36.708
the same,
then go on making more and more

00:51:36.708 --> 00:51:39.989
changes,
and the answer will not change.

00:51:39.989 --> 00:51:45.280
So I'm going to take another
path where I go tangent to the

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.469
lines, along a circle.
 

00:51:47.469 --> 00:51:52.295
Then I go here,
till I get to that radius,

00:51:52.295 --> 00:51:56.179
then I turn around and do that.
 

00:51:56.179 --> 00:52:01.525
I claim the integral will be
the same on this path,

00:52:01.525 --> 00:52:05.159
this one, that one and that
one.

00:52:05.159 --> 00:52:09.257
So I want you to think about
why it's going to be true,

00:52:09.257 --> 00:52:09.789
okay?
 

00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:12.429
Think of it,
why it's okay to do that.

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:17.469
You've got a new path but it
doesn't make a difference.

00:52:17.469 --> 00:52:18.030
Ready?
 

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:21.289
Tell you the answer now?
 

00:52:21.289 --> 00:52:26.190
How many people don't know why
it's true?

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:28.480
So other people know why it's
true.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.309
I'm going to ask the other
people.

00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:33.349
Okay, why is it true?
 

00:52:33.349 --> 00:52:35.139
Student:  I raised my
hand.

00:52:35.139 --> 00:52:37.329
Prof: You raised your
hand.

00:52:37.329 --> 00:52:39.119
All right.
 

00:52:39.119 --> 00:52:39.639
Yes?
 

00:52:39.639 --> 00:52:41.757
Student:  It's true,
because when you're moving on

00:52:41.757 --> 00:52:43.516
the paths this way,
they're radial,

00:52:43.516 --> 00:52:46.302
so the radius is constant,
which would mean that there's

00:52:46.302 --> 00:52:46.739
no _______.
 

00:52:46.739 --> 00:52:47.969
Prof: There's no what?
 

00:52:47.969 --> 00:52:49.898
Student:  There's no
change in force because the

00:52:49.898 --> 00:52:50.650
radius is constant.
 

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:52.650
Prof: That's not a good
reason.

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:53.739
The force is changing.
 

00:52:53.739 --> 00:52:57.710
It's that way there,
it's that way there.

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:58.909
Why is it not?
 

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:00.789
Student:  It's always
perpendicular to the force.

00:53:00.789 --> 00:53:04.525
Prof: The force and the
displacement are perpendicular

00:53:04.525 --> 00:53:07.317
in this section,
because force is radial,

00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:11.268
displacement by definition is
tangential along the circle.

00:53:11.268 --> 00:53:17.639
So dr is perpendicular
to F.

00:53:17.639 --> 00:53:19.409
Oh, by the way,
I should tell you something.

00:53:19.409 --> 00:53:22.139
I usually forget this.
 

00:53:22.139 --> 00:53:25.739
We want the electric force to
be conservative,

00:53:25.739 --> 00:53:26.380
right?
 

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:30.085
The electric force in any
situation on a charge is

00:53:30.085 --> 00:53:32.809
q times the electric
field.

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:35.498
You will agree that if the
electric field is conservative,

00:53:35.498 --> 00:53:38.045
multiplying by a number
q is not going to change

00:53:38.045 --> 00:53:38.659
the fact.
 

00:53:38.659 --> 00:53:40.931
So I'm going to prove the
electric field is conservative,

00:53:40.931 --> 00:53:43.365
then the electric force on any
charge is just proportional to

00:53:43.365 --> 00:53:43.650
it.
 

00:53:43.650 --> 00:53:44.739
It will also be conservative.
 

00:53:44.739 --> 00:53:47.735
So really taking force on a
unit charge and seeing what

00:53:47.735 --> 00:53:48.289
happens.
 

00:53:48.289 --> 00:53:51.340
So this section is for free.
 

00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:54.865
This section--we'll come to
that--this section is also for

00:53:54.865 --> 00:53:58.393
free, because F looks
like that and dr looks

00:53:58.393 --> 00:53:59.260
like that.
 

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:04.954
Here you can pair the sections,
so that that section is paired

00:54:04.954 --> 00:54:09.434
with that section,
because you're moving the same

00:54:09.434 --> 00:54:13.170
radial distance with a radial
force.

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:15.094
F⋅dr,
the dot product,

00:54:15.094 --> 00:54:16.969
is the same here,
section by section.

00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:19.186
Any work you're doing here,
you're doing here,

00:54:19.186 --> 00:54:20.909
therefore the answer is the
same.

00:54:20.909 --> 00:54:24.273
Then you can see that you can
go on adding all kinds of

00:54:24.273 --> 00:54:26.099
changes,
radial and angle,

00:54:26.099 --> 00:54:28.452
radial or angular,
and when you're done,

00:54:28.452 --> 00:54:30.909
all the radial integrals will
give you that part,

00:54:30.909 --> 00:54:33.789
and the angulars won't count.
 

00:54:33.789 --> 00:54:36.313
So as you move around,
it's only when you're moving

00:54:36.313 --> 00:54:38.940
radially you're even aware that
you're doing work.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.849
Going in the angle doesn't
matter.

00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:45.380
And the net radial change in
going from here to here is that

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:48.070
distance, no matter how you
move.

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:51.599
Now you might say,
prove to me that that integral

00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:55.717
is the same as that integral,
because this was made up of

00:54:55.717 --> 00:54:58.070
radial and angular sections.
 

00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:01.909
This doesn't seem that way,
but we can always make a very

00:55:01.909 --> 00:55:05.679
fine mesh in which every
displacement is approximated by

00:55:05.679 --> 00:55:08.079
radial angle or radial angular.
 

00:55:08.079 --> 00:55:11.364
So you can approximate any
contour by sequence of radial

00:55:11.364 --> 00:55:12.559
and angular moves.
 

00:55:12.559 --> 00:55:14.239
Angular moves are free.
 

00:55:14.239 --> 00:55:17.820
Radial moves keep track of the
change in the distance times the

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.710
force and you can pair them with
this reference.

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:25.610
Every dr we move there
we have a dr here.

00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:30.460
So that is the pictorial proof
of this.

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:37.922
So let's now calculate what is
the potential due to that

00:55:37.922 --> 00:55:40.230
electric field.
 

00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:42.210
So we're going to do the
calculation.

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:48.617
So we use the formula that
U at r_2

00:55:48.617 --> 00:55:53.255
- U at
r_1 is - the

00:55:53.255 --> 00:55:58.670
integral e⋅dr
from 1 to 2.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:00.349
You see, we know it is
conservative.

00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:02.190
I've shown you with this
argument.

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:05.927
So if you want to find the
potential energy between 1 and

00:56:05.927 --> 00:56:09.400
2, you can take any path you
like between 1 and 2.

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.719
So let's pick the points.
 

00:56:11.719 --> 00:56:17.579
Here is point 1 and here is
point 2.

00:56:17.579 --> 00:56:20.972
You can pick any path you like,
so here is what I'm going to

00:56:20.972 --> 00:56:21.260
do.
 

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:25.813
I'm going to go radially out
and then I'm going to go along

00:56:25.813 --> 00:56:26.599
the arc.
 

00:56:26.599 --> 00:56:31.117
So this is 1,
this is 2, but I'm going to

00:56:31.117 --> 00:56:36.989
start at some intermediate point
3, then go right.

00:56:36.989 --> 00:56:41.139
So work is done here;
no work is done there.

00:56:41.139 --> 00:56:43.809
So let's just find the work in
going from 1 to 3,

00:56:43.809 --> 00:56:49.003
which is -e_r
(is a vector in the radial

00:56:49.003 --> 00:56:52.157
direction)
¼Πε

00:56:52.157 --> 00:56:54.570
_0r^(2).
 

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:56.018
That is F.
 

00:56:56.018 --> 00:56:58.331
The displacement is
e_r times the

00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:00.219
little length of
e_r.

00:57:00.219 --> 00:57:01.840
Do you understand that?
 

00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:05.592
A tiny section here,
dr, has a magnitude

00:57:05.592 --> 00:57:08.610
equal to the change in the
radius,

00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:11.059
and a direction equal to the
radius unit rate--

00:57:11.059 --> 00:57:14.000
the radial direction.
 

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.141
And you want to do this from
r_1 to

00:57:18.141 --> 00:57:20.010
r_2.
 

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:24.257
Okay, e_r
⋅e_r

00:57:24.257 --> 00:57:27.199
is 1 so I get--I forgot one
thing.

00:57:27.199 --> 00:57:32.159
You guys know what I forgot
here?

00:57:32.159 --> 00:57:33.199
One thing's missing.
 

00:57:33.199 --> 00:57:33.929
Yes?
 

00:57:33.929 --> 00:57:35.010
Student:  Q.
 

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:37.250
Prof: When did you
notice that?

00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:38.110
Just now?
 

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:40.650
Student:  Little bit.
 

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:42.159
Prof: Don't wait.
 

00:57:42.159 --> 00:57:43.760
Don't wait even one second.
 

00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.329
I told you what happens to me,
right?

00:57:45.329 --> 00:57:48.530
When I go home,
they tie me to a stool and they

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.619
force me to watch this tape.
 

00:57:50.619 --> 00:57:53.230
And it's just awful when you
think you dropped a symbol,

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:54.630
and you're waiting for somebody
to say,

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:56.590
"Hey, what about
q?"

00:57:56.590 --> 00:58:00.201
So don't have any--if you
hesitate, it's only to wait,

00:58:00.201 --> 00:58:01.360
not to stop me.
 

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.992
All right, so look,
I'll get the q because I

00:58:03.992 --> 00:58:06.730
know the formula from the time I
was in a sandbox.

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:09.719
I know something is wrong,
but I don't want to get to that

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:12.289
last stage, then go back and
change everything.

00:58:12.289 --> 00:58:16.579
So I forgot the q
sitting at the origin here.

00:58:16.579 --> 00:58:19.878
Okay, so this is
q/4Πε

00:58:19.878 --> 00:58:21.369
_0.
 

00:58:21.369 --> 00:58:26.077
Integral of -1/r^(2) is just
1/r, so that's

00:58:26.077 --> 00:58:31.460
1/r_2 −
1/r_1.

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:35.530
Again, sorry,
I made a mistake now.

00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:40.014
The change in potential energy
is really q times

00:58:40.014 --> 00:58:44.748
e, but q is the
test charge, so I'm going to

00:58:44.748 --> 00:58:46.659
call this V.
 

00:58:46.659 --> 00:58:49.791
So it's hard for you guys to do
it on the notebook,

00:58:49.791 --> 00:58:53.362
because I want to distinguish
between potential energy and

00:58:53.362 --> 00:58:54.239
potential.
 

00:58:54.239 --> 00:58:57.978
In other words,
the force--now some other test

00:58:57.978 --> 00:59:02.550
charge q is the electric
field times q.

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:06.471
And the force is going to be -
the gradient of the potential

00:59:06.471 --> 00:59:07.070
energy.
 

00:59:07.070 --> 00:59:13.827
The electric field is going to
be - the gradient of the

00:59:13.827 --> 00:59:15.329
potential.
 

00:59:15.329 --> 00:59:16.079
Yes?
 

00:59:16.079 --> 00:59:19.409
Student:  In that last
line, should that be a negative?

00:59:19.409 --> 00:59:20.179
Prof: A negative?
 

00:59:20.179 --> 00:59:21.150
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:22.518
Prof: Let's see.
 

00:59:22.518 --> 00:59:28.887
There's a negative here,
and integral of -1/r^(2)

00:59:28.887 --> 00:59:30.739
is 1/r.
 

00:59:30.739 --> 00:59:31.610
Student:  Oh, okay.
 

00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:34.690
Prof: So the upper
limit, then there's lower limit.

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:36.829
So let me correct what I said.
 

00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:38.844
I'm trying to find the
difference in what's called the

00:59:38.844 --> 00:59:39.300
potential.
 

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.980
It's not the potential energy.
 

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:46.543
Potential difference between
some point and some other point

00:59:46.543 --> 00:59:49.329
is the work done on a unit
charge.

00:59:49.329 --> 00:59:51.018
If you've got some other
charge, you should multiply it

00:59:51.018 --> 00:59:51.518
by the charge.
 

00:59:51.518 --> 00:59:54.150
So the energy of some other
charge in this field,

00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:56.452
the potential energy,
is q times the

00:59:56.452 --> 00:59:57.219
potential.
 

00:59:57.219 --> 01:00:03.248
So U is q times
this thing that I'm calling

01:00:03.248 --> 01:00:04.539
potential.
 

01:00:04.539 --> 01:00:07.440
So we're comparing this
expression to this expression,

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:12.184
we can conclude that V
at any point r is

01:00:12.184 --> 01:00:17.018
q/4Πε
_0(1/r)

01:00:17.018 --> 01:00:18.539
any constant.
 

01:00:18.539 --> 01:00:20.568
Any constant,
because you cannot immediately

01:00:20.568 --> 01:00:23.259
say this guy is equal to this
guy and that guy is equal to

01:00:23.259 --> 01:00:25.061
that guy,
because even if you add a

01:00:25.061 --> 01:00:27.760
constant to both,
it will still be true.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.860
And we can pick the constant
any way we like.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:34.965
It is common to pick the
constant so that V goes

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:38.369
to 0 as r goes to
infinity.

01:00:38.369 --> 01:00:39.559
That's what we will do.
 

01:00:39.559 --> 01:00:42.610
That's the convention.
 

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:52.809
Then we can write here,
what is the V(r).

01:00:52.809 --> 01:00:55.514
This is the V due to a
single charge,

01:00:55.514 --> 01:00:59.289
and the U(r) = to
some q_0.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:01.615
I don't want to call q
again, because q is the

01:01:01.615 --> 01:01:02.800
guy producing the potential.
 

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.199
q_0 is the guy
experiencing the force.

01:01:05.199 --> 01:01:15.099
So q_0 times
V is the potential energy

01:01:15.099 --> 01:01:23.050
of charge q,
of charge q_0

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:27.268
sitting at that point.
 

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:29.492
Now let's also verify,
if you like,

01:01:29.492 --> 01:01:33.416
that this V(r)
does produce the electric

01:01:33.416 --> 01:01:34.070
field.
 

01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:36.007
In other words,
I got the V by

01:01:36.007 --> 01:01:37.570
integrating electric field.
 

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:39.998
I want to go back,
just to get you familiar with

01:01:39.998 --> 01:01:40.360
this.
 

01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:46.710
Getting the electric field from
the potential.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:52.170
Let's try to do that.
 

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:56.451
So E_x--let me
just do

01:01:56.451 --> 01:02:02.422
E_x--it's
−dV/dx,

01:02:02.422 --> 01:02:03.550
right?
 

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:08.418
-dV /dx =
-q/4Πε

01:02:08.418 --> 01:02:10.268
_0.
 

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:16.043
Derivative of 1/r is
-1/r^(2) times

01:02:16.043 --> 01:02:18.690
dr/dx.
 

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:20.989
What is dr/dx?
 

01:02:20.989 --> 01:02:24.940
r is (x^(2)
y^(2)

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:27.289
z^(2))^(1/2).
 

01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:31.028
dr/dx is just
x divided by this whole

01:02:31.028 --> 01:02:33.719
thing, is x divided by
r.

01:02:33.719 --> 01:02:37.958
So this becomes
q/4Πε

01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:41.268
_0
(1/r^(2))

01:02:41.268 --> 01:02:43.750
(x/r).
 

01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:47.969
This is E_x.
 

01:02:47.969 --> 01:02:50.829
So what will be the vector
E?

01:02:50.829 --> 01:02:52.760
Can you do that in your head?
 

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.193
Multiply this by i,
and do similarly for y

01:02:56.193 --> 01:02:58.130
and z and add them up.
 

01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:59.289
What will you find?
 

01:02:59.289 --> 01:03:03.603
You will find E will equal
q/4Πε

01:03:03.603 --> 01:03:06.766
_0
(1/r^(2)),

01:03:06.766 --> 01:03:09.929
times r over r.
 

01:03:09.929 --> 01:03:13.376
Put r over r,
position vector over r,

01:03:13.376 --> 01:03:16.099
is the unit vector in the
radial direction.

01:03:16.099 --> 01:03:18.829
I'm doing this a little fast,
because this is something you

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:19.960
can go home and check.
 

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.539
I don't want to spend too much
time doing it.

01:03:21.539 --> 01:03:24.422
I claim that if you took this
potential and took its x

01:03:24.422 --> 01:03:26.896
derivative or y
derivative or z

01:03:26.896 --> 01:03:29.128
derivative,
you get the x,

01:03:29.128 --> 01:03:33.440
y or z components of
the electric field.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:39.454
Okay, if you didn't follow
this, you should go home and

01:03:39.454 --> 01:03:42.349
check that this is true.
 

01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:45.273
All right, so this is not that
important for me,

01:03:45.273 --> 01:03:47.949
this checking,
because we know it's going to

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:48.510
work.
 

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:53.010
What is important for me is for
you to know that we've now found

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:56.655
that the potential due to a
single charge leads to a

01:03:56.655 --> 01:03:58.300
conservative force.
 

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:00.606
The field due to a single
charge leads to a conservative

01:04:00.606 --> 01:04:02.315
one,
therefore by superposition,

01:04:02.315 --> 01:04:04.150
if you add any number of
charges,

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.730
if you find the potential due
to all of them,

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:13.583
then you take its gradient that
will give you a conservative

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.559
electric field.
 

01:04:15.559 --> 01:04:18.460
So what have you got so far?
 

01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:29.019
Our gain is the following - we
have a law of conservation of

01:04:29.019 --> 01:04:32.525
energy,
which is the following -

01:04:32.525 --> 01:04:36.815
½mv^(2) q
(this q is the q

01:04:36.815 --> 01:04:41.106
of the body you're interested
in) times V at the point

01:04:41.106 --> 01:04:45.181
r_1 = ½
mv_2 ^(2)

01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:49.829
q times v at the
point r_2.

01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:54.268
And what is V at any
point r?

01:04:54.268 --> 01:04:57.927
It's the sum
1/4Πε

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:00.170
_0.
 

01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:03.090
Let's imagine there are many,
many charges,

01:05:03.090 --> 01:05:04.356
q_1,
q_2,

01:05:04.356 --> 01:05:05.422
q_3,
each one at

01:05:05.422 --> 01:05:06.722
r_1,
r_2,

01:05:06.722 --> 01:05:07.789
r_3,
etc.

01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:11.016
This equals
q_i which is

01:05:11.016 --> 01:05:15.452
charge number I divided by the
length of the vector from

01:05:15.452 --> 01:05:20.048
r_i to the
r where I'm finding the

01:05:20.048 --> 01:05:21.340
potential.
 

01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.070
In other words,
this is where I want the

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:27.079
potential r.
 

01:05:27.079 --> 01:05:28.550
This is
r_1_

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:30.849
and q_1
is sitting there.

01:05:30.849 --> 01:05:33.376
This is r_2
and q_2_

01:05:33.376 --> 01:05:34.929
is sitting there and so
on.

01:05:34.929 --> 01:05:37.960
And the potential at the point
that I'm interested in is

01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.268
obtained by taking each q
divided by the distance from

01:05:41.268 --> 01:05:43.882
that point,
and this is the usual

01:05:43.882 --> 01:05:47.018
1/4Πε
_0.

01:05:47.018 --> 01:05:53.152
That is the complete story,
and the charges are not

01:05:53.152 --> 01:05:59.530
discrete but continuous you can
write an integral.

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:02.706
So every problem,
you first find the potential by

01:06:02.706 --> 01:06:05.619
adding the potential from all
the charges.

01:06:05.619 --> 01:06:09.409
Then its gradient will give it
the electric field.

01:06:09.409 --> 01:06:13.820
But we have now a law of
conservation of energy with this

01:06:13.820 --> 01:06:15.869
as the conserved energy.
 

01:06:15.869 --> 01:06:29.628
The second advantage is that it
is easier to work with V

01:06:29.628 --> 01:06:34.289
than with E.
 

01:06:34.289 --> 01:06:39.581
So why do you think it's easier
to find V and then find

01:06:39.581 --> 01:06:43.657
E from it,
by taking derivatives than the

01:06:43.657 --> 01:06:45.480
other way around?
 

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:46.480
Yes?
 

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.440
Student:  V is a
scalar.

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.179
Prof: Right.
 

01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:54.750
Student: 
&gt;

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:56.340
Prof: I'm sorry,
I didn't hear the last part.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:58.032
Student:  It's always
easier to take derivatives than

01:06:58.032 --> 01:06:59.769
to integrate--
Prof: Very good.

01:06:59.769 --> 01:07:00.409
Yes.
 

01:07:00.409 --> 01:07:03.190
Let me repeat that.
 

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:06.601
If you want to find the
potential due to many charges,

01:07:06.601 --> 01:07:09.820
you simply add the numbers
coming from each one.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:13.400
There are no arrows,
there are no vectors.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:17.050
Notice the formula for V
has no vectors in it.

01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:18.539
Each one contributes a number.
 

01:07:18.539 --> 01:07:20.664
Each charge contributes a
number to the point they're

01:07:20.664 --> 01:07:21.320
interested in.
 

01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.210
Add them all up,
find the number here,

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:24.489
there, everywhere else.
 

01:07:24.489 --> 01:07:27.639
Then take derivatives of your
answer to get the field.

01:07:27.639 --> 01:07:30.159
That's going to be a lot easier
than adding the vectors.

01:07:30.159 --> 01:07:35.474
So I'm going to illustrate that
with one simple problem and

01:07:35.474 --> 01:07:38.590
that's the last thing for today.
 

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:40.769
That's the dipole.
 

01:07:40.769 --> 01:07:42.909
So here is our dipole.
 

01:07:42.909 --> 01:07:47.253
Let's take a charge q,
-q at -a and

01:07:47.253 --> 01:07:49.070
q at a.
 

01:07:49.070 --> 01:07:55.929
And we want to find the field
there.

01:07:55.929 --> 01:08:00.818
So let's call that distance
r_  and let's

01:08:00.818 --> 01:08:04.420
call that distance
r_-.

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:08.449
These are not vectors;
these are just lengths.

01:08:08.449 --> 01:08:11.878
If you want to find the
electric field directly,

01:08:11.878 --> 01:08:14.139
you know what you have to do.
 

01:08:14.139 --> 01:08:17.900
You have to find the vector
here and you've got to find the

01:08:17.900 --> 01:08:21.662
vector there due to the second
guy, add the two vectors and

01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:22.960
find the result.
 

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.992
Of course, you can do it,
but it's going to be very

01:08:24.992 --> 01:08:26.711
tedious,
because you have to find the

01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:29.390
direction of the vector here and
the direction of the vector

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:32.042
here,
in terms of all these

01:08:32.042 --> 01:08:33.430
coordinates.
 

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:37.078
What we will do instead is to
find the potential everywhere,

01:08:37.078 --> 01:08:38.970
and take the x and
y derivatives of the

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:40.569
potential to get the
E_x and

01:08:40.569 --> 01:08:41.479
E_y.
 

01:08:41.479 --> 01:08:42.689
Well, let's do that.
 

01:08:42.689 --> 01:08:46.439
So let's find the total
potential due to these two guys.

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:50.997
The first one is
q/4Πε

01:08:50.997 --> 01:08:57.640
_0 divided by
1/r_  -

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:02.590
1/r_-. That's
it.

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:04.270
Just wanted to simplify the
expression a little bit.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:07.149
So this is true for any
separation,

01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:09.828
but I want the limit in which
r_  and

01:09:09.828 --> 01:09:12.609
r_- are much
bigger than the separation

01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:13.470
between them.
 

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:19.193
So let's define an r
which is the position vector of

01:09:19.193 --> 01:09:25.408
the point you're interested in
from the center of the dipole.

01:09:25.408 --> 01:09:26.578
So we've got to find r_
 and

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:27.189
r_-.
 

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:30.300
You get that, you're done.
 

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:36.635
So vector r_
^( )you can see =

01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:42.970
r -
ai/2 and vector

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:51.510
r_- = vector
r ai/2.

01:09:51.510 --> 01:09:54.905
Because the vector
ai/2 looks like

01:09:54.905 --> 01:09:59.171
this, so ai/2
r_  should give

01:09:59.171 --> 01:10:00.399
you r.
 

01:10:00.399 --> 01:10:01.840
You can check that.
 

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:05.461
And you can check that
ai/2 r

01:10:05.461 --> 01:10:07.899
gives you r_-.
 

01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:10.310
so these are the two
expressions.

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:12.899
So what is r_ ?
 

01:10:12.899 --> 01:10:18.710
r^( ) is the length of
the vector r_ .

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:23.000
That's equal to the square root
of the length squared.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.341
The length squared of r_
 squared = root of

01:10:29.341 --> 01:10:34.609
(r - ai/2)
⋅ (r -

01:10:34.609 --> 01:10:37.189
ai/2).
 

01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:39.390
Student:  Why is it
a i/2?

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:42.538
Prof: Oh,
I'm sorry, it's not.

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:45.069
It is half the distance,
but it's really only a.

01:10:45.069 --> 01:10:50.448
Thank you.
 

01:10:50.448 --> 01:10:52.432
Yeah, in fact,
one puts the 2a as a

01:10:52.432 --> 01:10:54.609
separation to avoid all these
factors of 2.

01:10:54.609 --> 01:10:56.810
So now you take the length
squared.

01:10:56.810 --> 01:11:01.985
It's equal to r^(2)
a^(2) minus twice

01:11:01.985 --> 01:11:05.300
r⋅a.
 

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:08.859
The other one would be r^(2)
 a^(2) twice

01:11:08.859 --> 01:11:10.970
r⋅a.
 

01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:16.775
And that we can approximate as
r times 1 - twice

01:11:16.775 --> 01:11:21.936
r⋅
a/r^(2)^( )to

01:11:21.936 --> 01:11:23.550
the 1 half.
 

01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:29.750
I'll tell you what I did here.
 

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:31.780
I'm going to neglect a
squared compared to r

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.600
squared, because r is
much bigger than it.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:36.082
But I'm going to keep this
r⋅a

01:11:36.082 --> 01:11:38.248
term because this has got two
powers of a,

01:11:38.248 --> 01:11:39.920
where a is a small
number.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:42.421
It's got 1 power of a
and 1 power of r,

01:11:42.421 --> 01:11:45.069
so it's much stronger than this
term, so I keep that.

01:11:45.069 --> 01:11:47.603
Keeping the second term,
so I've forgotten the

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:48.729
a^(2) term.
 

01:11:48.729 --> 01:11:51.985
In this one,
from the theorem I've been

01:11:51.985 --> 01:11:56.698
giving you guys all the time,
it's 1 - r⋅

01:11:56.698 --> 01:11:58.670
a/r^(2).
 

01:11:58.670 --> 01:12:03.666
Remember 1 x^(n) is
roughly 1 nx dot dot dot

01:12:03.666 --> 01:12:07.319
if x is small,
and x is indeed small,

01:12:07.319 --> 01:12:09.512
because it's
r⋅a

01:12:09.512 --> 01:12:10.850
over r squared.
 

01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:18.618
So now we can see V =
q/4Πε

01:12:18.618 --> 01:12:24.518
_0{1/[r(1-
r⋅

01:12:24.518 --> 01:12:31.136
a/r^(2))]
- 1/[r(1 r⋅

01:12:31.136 --> 01:12:35.310
a/r^(2))]} .
 

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:40.350
This is going to be found in
every textbook in the planet,

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:42.649
so don't worry about it.
 

01:12:42.649 --> 01:12:46.932
If you simplify this again by
taking it upstairs,

01:12:46.932 --> 01:12:49.966
you'll get twice
a⋅r

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.930
/r^(2).
 

01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:57.689
That's the potential.
 

01:12:57.689 --> 01:13:00.470
Now twice a times q
is the dipole moment,

01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:08.342
so it's p⋅r
/4Πε

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:12.279
_0r^(3).
 

01:13:12.279 --> 01:13:15.310
That's the final piece,
the dipole moment.

01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:21.255
Dipole moment is a charge times
the separation between the

01:13:21.255 --> 01:13:25.948
charges, which is 2a
times q.

01:13:25.948 --> 01:13:28.560
Okay, so what one should do now
is,

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:31.274
having taken this V,
one can take its x and

01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:34.327
y derivatives very easily
to calculate the electric field

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.198
at each point.
 

01:13:35.198 --> 01:13:37.306
It's very easy to take the
derivative of this,

01:13:37.306 --> 01:13:39.038
just pick the x or
y.

01:13:39.038 --> 01:13:42.056
It's one of the homework
problems I've assigned to you,

01:13:42.056 --> 01:13:44.069
where I show you the dipole
field.

01:13:44.069 --> 01:13:47.094
So the moral of the story is,
add the potential due to all

01:13:47.094 --> 01:13:50.118
the charges, then take the
derivative, because derivatives

01:13:50.118 --> 01:13:51.340
are easier to take.
 

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.180
Yes?
 

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.762
Student:  The condition
for that result,

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.140
is r much bigger than
a?

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:58.439
Prof: Yes.
 

01:13:58.439 --> 01:14:01.434
Up till some point,
everything is exact,

01:14:01.434 --> 01:14:04.659
but then this is long distance
property.

01:14:04.659 --> 01:14:08.720
Any questions?
 

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:10.430
Okay, thank you.
 

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:16.000

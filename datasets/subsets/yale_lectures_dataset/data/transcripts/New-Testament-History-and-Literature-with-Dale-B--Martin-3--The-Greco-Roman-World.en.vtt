00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.150
Prof: Religion can't be
divorced from social,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.510
political, and historical
contexts and issues.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.698
And so what we're going to do
today is do, one,

00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:13.640
the first of two lectures.
 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.271
Now these are going to be sort
of dreary, boring,

00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:22.770
typical Martin lectures;
dreary and boring historical

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.410
surveys.
 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.790
And I just have to do this
today on the Greco-Roman world,

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.240
tell you everything you need to
know about the Greco-Roman

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.130
world,
at least for this semester.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.290
And then next time,
next Wednesday--

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.120
because remember we're not
meeting on Monday--

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.241
next Wednesday,
I'll do a similar kind of

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:39.690
lecture for everything you need
to know about Ancient Judaism,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.360
to put the New Testament into
its historical context.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.659
So you'll just have to survive
these two very historical survey

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.640
lectures, because it's material
that you need to know.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.870
I'll try to make it as
interesting as I humanly can do.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.577
We now find the New Testament
in the same book as the Old

00:00:56.577 --> 00:00:59.520
Testament, as Christians call
it;

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.240
and as Jews call it,
the Hebrew Bible or

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.079
theTanakh.
 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.635
Clearly early Christianity has
got to be studied in the context

00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:08.560
of Ancient Judaism,
and so we'll do so next time.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.480
We'll look at the Jewish
context, for example,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.573
for the development of the New
Testament and early

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:13.299
Christianity.
 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.849
But, to understand Judaism,
of the time of Jesus and Paul,

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:22.292
which is centuries after the
chronological end of the Hebrew

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:25.379
Bible,
we need to understand Judaism

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:29.140
as a Greco-Roman cult;
it is a Greco-Roman religion.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.970
And that means we need to
understand at least a little bit

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.459
about the Greco-Roman world.
 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:36.884
For us, we can start not so all
the way back at Classical

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:40.369
Greece, but with Alexander the
Great, and the beginning of

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.694
Hellenization;
that is, the Grecization of the

00:01:43.694 --> 00:01:46.780
eastern part of the Ancient
Mediterranean.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.530
That's all Hellenization means,
making it Greek.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.110
Alexander the Great's father
was Philip II,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.629
King of Macedonia,
King of Macedon,

00:01:55.629 --> 00:02:01.028
and he conquered different
Greek city-states by defeating

00:02:01.028 --> 00:02:05.560
Athens and its allies at
Chaeronea in 338 BC.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.403
And I've got some of these
names and some of these dates on

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:11.990
the handout that you have before
you.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.180
Alexander himself was born in
356, BCE of course.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.900
He was educated by Aristotle,
beginning in 343.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.050
He was made king after the
assassination of his father in

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.150
336 BCE.
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.720
As your textbook points out,
as Ehrman points out--

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.372
and you probably already know,
but for some of you this may

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:39.288
sound like odd lingo--
I'm using CE for the Common

00:02:39.288 --> 00:02:42.318
Era, which is exactly the same
thing as AD,

00:02:42.318 --> 00:02:45.440
and I'm using BCE for Before
the Common Era,

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.650
which is the same dates as
Before Christ.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.758
We in religious studies tend to
like these terms,

00:02:50.758 --> 00:02:53.154
rather than BC,
Before Christ,

00:02:53.154 --> 00:02:55.697
and AD,
because AD actually stands for

00:02:55.697 --> 00:02:58.720
Anno Domini,
in the year of our Lord.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.502
And because we in religious
studies include people in our

00:03:01.502 --> 00:03:03.538
departments who are in Judaic
studies,

00:03:03.538 --> 00:03:05.568
Islam, Hinduism,
all kinds of religions--

00:03:05.568 --> 00:03:08.985
you can imagine that people who
are in other religions might not

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:11.966
want to call things "in the
year of our Lord,"

00:03:11.966 --> 00:03:13.810
since Jesus is not their Lord.
 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.748
So in simply the interests of
reflecting the plurality of our

00:03:17.748 --> 00:03:20.572
own departments,
we tend to use these terms,

00:03:20.572 --> 00:03:22.280
rather than BC and AD.
 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.658
But it means the same thing.
 

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:28.681
Alexander defeated the Persian
Army, which at that time

00:03:28.681 --> 00:03:31.883
controlled all of Asia Minor,
Modern Turkey,

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:35.310
and had even threatened to
control Greece.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.181
He defeated the Persian Army in
Asia Minor at Granicus,

00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:43.160
the Battle of Granicus,
in 334.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.156
That put Alexander and his
Macedonian Army in charge of

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:50.840
both Greece and Asia Minor.
 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.913
When Darius II died,
who was the king of the

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:59.651
Persians, Alexander himself took
on Darius's title,

00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:02.020
which was Great King.
 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.080
After defeating the Persians
again,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.508
he pushed his army all the way
to the Indus River in India,

00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:12.979
to the western part of what's
now India,

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.810
and what was then called India
also by Greeks.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.858
He wanted to go all the way to
the Ganges River,

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.389
but his army forced him to turn
back.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.805
He died in 323,
when he was not yet

00:04:24.805 --> 00:04:28.826
33-years-old,
and he died in Babylon of a

00:04:28.826 --> 00:04:33.550
fever, that is,
of course, modern day Iraq.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.377
After his death,
his empire was divided up among

00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:39.242
his generals,
and after some fighting and

00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:43.514
maneuvering and negotiations,
four successors to Alexander

00:04:43.514 --> 00:04:47.610
the Great finally ended up
splitting up his large empire

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.769
into four smaller empires.
 

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:53.440
And we call these four
successors simply the Diadochi.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.410
And I think that's actually not
on your handout,

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.709
so I'll write it out for you.
 

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:04.000
This is a Greek word that
simply means the successors.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.579
So the Diadokhoi,
the Greek plural of Diadochi,

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:10.343
as we often refer to it,
ended up splitting his army

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:13.216
into four parts and four
dynasties descending from the

00:05:13.216 --> 00:05:14.300
four successors.
 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.670
They were four generals of
Alexander.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.050
Now next time,
in my lecture on introducing

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.750
you to Judaism,
I'll talk about the importance

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.709
of at least two of these
empires,

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:27.038
because they're very important
for the history of Palestine and

00:05:27.038 --> 00:05:28.220
Israel at this time.
 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.817
But for now all you need to
know is that these four

00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:33.649
different kingdoms--
one was where we now have

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:36.420
Greece, another one was where
Syria is,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.569
another was Egypt,
and then there was another

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.065
further north,
but that's not as important for

00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:41.279
us.
 

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:45.009
The Syrian-Greek Empire and the
Egyptian-Greek Empire will

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:48.151
become very important for the
history of Judaism,

00:05:48.151 --> 00:05:49.920
and Jesus himself also.
 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.064
But for right now,
all you need to know is that

00:05:52.064 --> 00:05:54.872
all of these generals,
although they were Macedonians

00:05:54.872 --> 00:05:57.500
and spoke Macedonian and not
themselves Greek,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.086
but they had,
just like Alexander,

00:05:59.086 --> 00:06:00.769
they had adopted Greek
language,

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:01.850
Greek culture.
 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.680
They educated their children in
Greek ways.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.490
Alexander, of course,
had been educated by Aristotle,

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.009
when he was young,
and so he had adopted Greek

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.480
language and Greek literature
and a lot of other Greek ways.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.870
What Alexander had wanted to do
was to take all these different

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.793
peoples,
who spoke different languages

00:06:19.793 --> 00:06:24.175
and had different customs,
and use a Greek layer to sort

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:27.449
of unite his empire overall.
 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.100
Now he didn't really care about
the lower class people so much.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:32.684
So they could just still live
in their villages and out in the

00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:35.480
country and do their farming and
speak their own local language.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.428
But if you were going to be
elite--he wanted to establish

00:06:38.428 --> 00:06:41.377
cities throughout his empire
that would be actually Greek

00:06:41.377 --> 00:06:43.946
cities,
and he wanted to have the elite

00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:46.819
people all be able,
at least, to speak Greek.

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.069
You have therefore one world,
and in fact this whole dream of

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:52.968
Alexander--
and it was a very

00:06:52.968 --> 00:06:55.269
self-conscious,
propaganda campaign and a

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:57.629
cultural campaign on Alexander's
part.

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.569
He wanted to make one world.
 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.245
You really have,
therefore, for in some way the

00:07:02.245 --> 00:07:05.988
first time in history,
a dream of making all of his

00:07:05.988 --> 00:07:10.863
empire basically universal,
a dream of a universal vision,

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:13.884
for one world,
under one kind of culture,

00:07:13.884 --> 00:07:15.310
one kind of language.
 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.750
This really hadn't been
attempted.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.175
You see, in the previous
empires, like the Assyrian

00:07:19.175 --> 00:07:21.923
Empire,
or these kinds of--the Egyptian

00:07:21.923 --> 00:07:24.535
Empire,
when people conquered other

00:07:24.535 --> 00:07:26.737
peoples,
often all they wanted was

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:27.269
tribute.
 

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:30.120
They just wanted taxes and food
and money and that sort of

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:30.519
thing.
 

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:33.310
They didn't really care about
turning those people into

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.860
Egyptians or into Assyrians.
 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.543
And Alexander didn't really
care that much about the lower

00:07:37.543 --> 00:07:40.040
classes doing that,
but he still wanted the elites.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.800
And so he would plant Greek
cities and settle his veterans

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.980
in different parts of his empire
in Egypt,

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.745
in Syria, all the way over,
and sometimes in the western

00:07:47.745 --> 00:07:50.161
part of India,
and he would take his veterans

00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:52.694
of his army,
and he would drum them out of

00:07:52.694 --> 00:07:54.182
the army,
when they retired,

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:56.860
and he would give them land and
they'd build a city there,

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.980
and that city would be just
like a Greek city back home.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.201
And they all would speak what
developed to be a common form of

00:08:04.201 --> 00:08:07.384
Greek, slightly different from
Classical Greek,

00:08:07.384 --> 00:08:11.283
and we call that Koine Greek;
and koine is just a

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:13.829
Greek word that means common,
or shared.

00:08:13.829 --> 00:08:17.189
So the Bible is actually
written in Koine Greek,

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:20.139
because this was the form of
Greek that had become spread

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:22.983
around the eastern Mediterranean
by the time the Hebrew

00:08:22.983 --> 00:08:25.250
Scriptures were translated
themselves,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.202
and by the time the New
Testament writings were

00:08:28.202 --> 00:08:29.550
themselves written.
 

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.648
The Greek polis,
which is simply the Greek word

00:08:32.648 --> 00:08:34.567
for city,
had several institutions that

00:08:34.567 --> 00:08:36.799
are very important,
and they'll become important

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.730
for early Christianity and for
Judaism.

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.288
So you need to know what some
of those are.

00:08:40.288 --> 00:08:42.970
The polis itself is just
a Greek word for city.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.149
But you can't think of this as
in huge cities like we have now.

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:50.254
What they would call a polis
might only be 1000 citizens or

00:08:50.254 --> 00:08:50.750
5000.
 

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.639
So it wasn't like millions of
people.

00:08:52.639 --> 00:08:55.164
It wasn't nearly as big as
Rome, which would consist of a

00:08:55.164 --> 00:08:57.600
million inhabitants fairly
quickly around this time.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.860
The poleis--that's
plural for a Greek city--

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.634
the poleis or the
polises, they were much smaller

00:09:03.634 --> 00:09:05.831
than that,
but they would have several

00:09:05.831 --> 00:09:06.288
things.
 

00:09:06.288 --> 00:09:08.876
The city center,
the town, would be the center

00:09:08.876 --> 00:09:10.177
of this,
and that's where the

00:09:10.177 --> 00:09:11.917
institutions would be,
that's where the government

00:09:11.917 --> 00:09:13.269
would be,
that's where the different

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:15.210
buildings would be that I'm
going to explain later.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.373
But the polis also included the
surrounding farmland,

00:09:18.373 --> 00:09:19.528
and the villages.
 

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:22.980
So Athens was the polis
for Attica,

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.740
but it was also the polis
for all of Attica,

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.535
all that region around Athens,
including villages and farms

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:31.370
and other small towns too.
 

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.700
So there was a rural dependency
on these Greek cities.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.178
They all practiced a certain
kind of Greek education.

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.995
The Greek word paideia,
which is right there on your

00:09:41.995 --> 00:09:43.345
handout,
means education,

00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:45.892
but it also means more than
simply rote learning or

00:09:45.892 --> 00:09:48.490
memorization or learning to
read, like we think.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.289
Paideia is the Greek
word that means the formation of

00:09:51.289 --> 00:09:52.048
the young man.
 

00:09:52.048 --> 00:09:54.839
And I say young man because
throughout all this it was

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:57.259
mainly young men and boys who
were educated.

00:09:57.259 --> 00:09:59.139
Girls could be given some
education,

00:09:59.139 --> 00:10:01.038
if their families were wealthy
enough,

00:10:01.038 --> 00:10:04.087
but the cities didn't really
concern themselves so much with

00:10:04.087 --> 00:10:05.070
girls' education.
 

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.943
Their family might,
but the cities concerned

00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:08.950
themselves with the education of
their boys.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.702
So paideia referred to
the education of the young man,

00:10:12.702 --> 00:10:15.268
both mentally,
but militarily--so you were

00:10:15.268 --> 00:10:18.375
taught to fight--and culturally;
you might be taught other

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:19.129
things about culture.
 

00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:23.278
You might even have some music
training or something like that.

00:10:23.278 --> 00:10:26.308
The place where this took place
was the gymnasium.

00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:29.553
Now a gymnasium doesn't
mean what it means to in

00:10:29.553 --> 00:10:32.918
English, the gymnasium,
like Payne Whitney over there.

00:10:32.918 --> 00:10:35.828
It actually comes from the
Greek word for naked,

00:10:35.828 --> 00:10:36.820
gymnos.
 

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:40.240
And the reason it was called
'the naked place' is because,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.720
of course, young Greek men
always exercised in the nude and

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.519
played sports in the nude.
 

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:47.460
And so this is where you did it.
 

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.120
So where did you do this?
 

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.229
That came to be called
"the naked place,"

00:10:51.229 --> 00:10:52.200
the gymnasium.
 

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.389
But this also became the place
where you would do other kinds

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.899
of learning.
 

00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:57.187
So if you were learning
rhetoric, for example,

00:10:57.187 --> 00:10:59.221
you might practice giving
speeches at the

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:00.288
gymnasium.
 

00:11:00.288 --> 00:11:02.639
But also men in town would just
kind of gather there.

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.408
It was kind of a place where
men gathered,

00:11:04.408 --> 00:11:06.480
and they had gone to school at
the same place.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.590
You would meet your friends.
 

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.498
You might play some games,
you might play like checkers

00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:13.245
and these kinds of--bones,
bone knuckle bones games,

00:11:13.245 --> 00:11:14.700
that you can still see.
 

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.640
If you travel around in Greek
cities throughout the Ancient

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.779
Mediterranean,
you can see where they've

00:11:18.779 --> 00:11:22.611
carved little game boards into
flagstones of different temples

00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:24.639
or buildings,
in Greek cities.

00:11:24.639 --> 00:11:27.080
So this would all take place in
the gymnasium.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.620
You also had what they called
the ephebeia.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.524
When you were a young boy,
you would've studied just

00:11:32.524 --> 00:11:34.120
reading and writing Homer.
 

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.908
When you got to be about the
age of what you guys are here,

00:11:37.908 --> 00:11:40.389
you might enter the
ephebate;

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:43.547
you'd become an ephebe,
and that just meant that you

00:11:43.547 --> 00:11:46.705
were past your sort of early
secondary training and now you

00:11:46.705 --> 00:11:50.190
were being really in training to
be a warrior and a citizen.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.791
So the ephebes were
those boys who were between the

00:11:53.791 --> 00:11:56.129
age of maybe 16 or 17 and 20 or
22.

00:11:56.129 --> 00:11:59.639
You would march together in a
parade in town.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:02.379
You would go on military
training perhaps together.

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:03.889
You would also engage in sports
together,

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.615
and you would develop a
camaraderie because you were

00:12:06.615 --> 00:12:09.610
expected then to be the fighting
force for your city,

00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:10.990
your city-state.
 

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.094
So the ephebate,
or the ephebeia,

00:12:14.094 --> 00:12:18.210
was this institution that every
boy had to go through in order

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.908
then to be a full citizen of a
city.

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:24.226
You also had these political
structures that are in your

00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:24.830
handout.
 

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.308
The first political structure
is the demos.

00:12:27.308 --> 00:12:29.351
Demos just means the
"people,"

00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:31.658
it's just a Greek word for
"the people."

00:12:31.658 --> 00:12:35.865
But it actually referred more
politically to all of the male

00:12:35.865 --> 00:12:38.932
citizens, and in Greek cities,
by tradition,

00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:41.570
only men were citizens of a
city.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.962
This will change in Rome,
because in Rome women were

00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:46.027
citizens also,
although that didn't mean they

00:12:46.027 --> 00:12:47.058
were equal to men.
 

00:12:47.058 --> 00:12:49.984
But in Greek cities men were
citizens and women weren't

00:12:49.984 --> 00:12:50.580
citizens.
 

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.509
But with the revolution of
democracy in Athens,

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:55.928
which also spread then to other
Greek cities,

00:12:55.928 --> 00:12:58.808
partly because Athens did what
George Bush tried to do in Iraq,

00:12:58.808 --> 00:13:02.265
they tried to force democracy
on other Greek cities around the

00:13:02.265 --> 00:13:03.908
Eastern Mediterranean also.
 

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:07.038
So democracies of some sort
existed in different places.

00:13:07.038 --> 00:13:11.460
And a democracy--the demos
meant all the men of adult

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.451
citizenship;
that is, it excluded men who

00:13:14.451 --> 00:13:17.019
lived there who came from
elsewhere.

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:19.663
It excluded foreigners,
it excluded some laborers,

00:13:19.663 --> 00:13:22.038
it excluded slaves,
and it excluded women.

00:13:22.038 --> 00:13:25.309
But all the men who were
citizens had a vote,

00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:29.845
and the demos referred
to that political body of voting

00:13:29.845 --> 00:13:30.440
men.
 

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.456
Now democracies collapsed,
obviously, later,

00:13:33.456 --> 00:13:35.984
and Philip of Macedon,
and Alexander,

00:13:35.984 --> 00:13:38.230
did not promote democracies.
 

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.144
But they kept this idea that
the demos--that is,

00:13:41.144 --> 00:13:44.330
the adult citizen males of a
city--were a political body.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.673
And that's when,
if you had everybody come to

00:13:46.673 --> 00:13:49.230
the theater for a big debate
about something,

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:51.629
you could still have people
voting on certain things that

00:13:51.629 --> 00:13:54.144
the city might decide to do,
although they couldn't rule

00:13:54.144 --> 00:13:55.769
themselves completely by
themselves.

00:13:55.769 --> 00:13:59.370
Then you had a smaller council
that might be 50 people.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:01.620
It varied, the size,
according to the city.

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:03.629
The council was called the
boule,

00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:06.836
which is also in your handout,
and that referred to a smaller

00:14:06.836 --> 00:14:09.780
council of older men,
usually, who made decisions

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.490
that they then would put before
the whole,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.700
the demos, the whole voting
population.

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:16.951
And then you had the term
called the ekklesia,

00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:18.120
which is on your handout.
 

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:23.312
That really did refer to the
voting body of the citizens,

00:14:23.312 --> 00:14:26.649
or the gathered citizens
together.

00:14:26.649 --> 00:14:29.024
Ekklesia is a Greek
word, it just means "the

00:14:29.024 --> 00:14:29.889
calling out."
 

00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:33.168
Ekklesia therefore is
what you would call the

00:14:33.168 --> 00:14:35.135
assembly,
the Athenian Assembly,

00:14:35.135 --> 00:14:37.855
who would debate things and
vote on things that the

00:14:37.855 --> 00:14:39.241
boule,
the council,

00:14:39.241 --> 00:14:40.860
would put forward for a debate
or a vote.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.649
That was called the
ekklesia.

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:46.120
This is very important because
ekklesia, then,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.590
in our bible,
gets translated as--

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.649
Student: Ecclesiastes.
 

00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:51.869
Prof: Ecclesiastes does,
but it's called Ecclesiastes

00:14:51.869 --> 00:14:53.542
because that means "the
preacher,"

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:55.605
that's the translation from the
Hebrew word, "the

00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:56.811
preacher,"
qoheleth,

00:14:56.811 --> 00:14:57.590
for the book.
 

00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:59.529
So Ecclesiastes means the
preacher.

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:02.440
But ekklesia is a term
for the church.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.960
So this'll be odd,
when we get to early Christian

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.620
groups.
 

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.881
Why did these early Christian
groups decide to call themselves

00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:12.278
the town assembly?
 

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:15.791
Because by that time it's the
basic meaning of this term,

00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:16.918
ekklesia.
 

00:15:16.918 --> 00:15:19.759
And then you have other social
structures of any city-state.

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:21.149
For example, you have a theater.
 

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:23.240
The theater was a place where
you had performances.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.681
By the first century,
when Christianity was coming

00:15:25.681 --> 00:15:27.760
around,
it was not so much the place

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.528
where you'd go to see
necessarily high theater,

00:15:30.528 --> 00:15:37.450
like Sophocles or Euripides or
something like that.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.779
What you'd often do is go to
see farces or comedies.

00:15:40.779 --> 00:15:44.244
Or sometimes the Romans liked
to take a big theater and fill

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:47.244
the central part of the theater,
the cavea,

00:15:47.244 --> 00:15:50.798
with water and then stage naval
battles and that kind of thing.

00:15:50.798 --> 00:15:53.700
So people have all kinds of
entertainments in the theater.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.053
But it was also where often the
demos or the ekklesia

00:15:57.053 --> 00:16:00.244
would meet to have meetings
and holler at each other and

00:16:00.244 --> 00:16:01.379
have big debates.
 

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:04.365
So the ekklesia was the
city place, and it would often

00:16:04.365 --> 00:16:05.360
meet in a theater.
 

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.769
You also had games.
 

00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:10.538
So you had the gymnasium where
games would take place,

00:16:10.538 --> 00:16:13.230
but also you had the
hippodrome, which is in Greek,

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:14.878
which basically just means
"the horse running

00:16:14.878 --> 00:16:15.350
place."
 

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.408
This was when you had this big
track,

00:16:17.408 --> 00:16:21.240
and if you have wandered around
different Greek cities that are

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.014
dug up,
some of them will have the

00:16:23.014 --> 00:16:25.028
hippodrome there,
and you can see how huge they

00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:25.269
were.
 

00:16:25.269 --> 00:16:27.499
They had these huge stands,
and it was sort of like a

00:16:27.499 --> 00:16:29.256
football stadium,
except it was longer and

00:16:29.256 --> 00:16:31.528
narrower than what our football
stadium would be.

00:16:31.528 --> 00:16:35.076
But it had rows of seats like
that, usually made over a hill

00:16:35.076 --> 00:16:37.298
or dug into the ground in some
way.

00:16:37.298 --> 00:16:39.678
And the hippodrome,
which becomes the circus

00:16:39.678 --> 00:16:41.402
in Latin--
that's just the Latin

00:16:41.402 --> 00:16:44.126
translation of hippodrome,
because as you'll see,

00:16:44.126 --> 00:16:46.340
Romans started adopting a lot
of these,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.190
which were originally Greek
institutions,

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.350
into their society also.
 

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.879
So the hippodrome is the
circus in Latin.

00:16:52.879 --> 00:16:54.256
And eventually,
for the Romans,

00:16:54.256 --> 00:16:56.600
this would be very popular for
big chariot races.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.759
That's the big thing for the
Romans later.

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:01.495
And you'd also have baths;
that is, public places,

00:17:01.495 --> 00:17:04.772
sometimes where only men could
go, or sometimes women could go,

00:17:04.772 --> 00:17:07.470
or sometimes they would be
mixed in some places.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.579
Or sometimes they might have
men one day, women another time,

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.980
and mixed at other times.
 

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.220
So different cities had their
baths differently.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.714
But the bath would be a place
where at least especially the

00:17:17.714 --> 00:17:19.693
men would go,
after they'd been working out

00:17:19.693 --> 00:17:21.683
in the gymnasium,
and you go and--this is where

00:17:21.683 --> 00:17:23.009
the public toilets were too.
 

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:25.547
You can't wander around any
Greek city, or Roman city of the

00:17:25.547 --> 00:17:27.440
Ancient World,
without seeing the latrine.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.608
You can always find the latrine.
 

00:17:28.608 --> 00:17:31.500
And they always had latrines
and baths,

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:35.240
and you'd have the cold room
where you'd have cold water,

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.022
you'd have the tepid room where
you'd have kind of lukewarm

00:17:37.022 --> 00:17:38.198
water,
and you'd have the hot room

00:17:38.198 --> 00:17:39.130
where you'd have hot water.
 

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:42.758
So this is where you'd go to
relax, to make a business deal,

00:17:42.758 --> 00:17:45.771
to meet your friends,
to chat, to try to have sex,

00:17:45.771 --> 00:17:47.308
try to meet somebody.
 

00:17:47.308 --> 00:17:49.380
All kinds of things go on in
these baths.

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:53.000
But those basic structures are
part of any kind of Greek city

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.390
in the Ancient World.
 

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.006
And what Alexander and his
successors did was they took

00:17:57.006 --> 00:18:00.340
that basic Greek structure,
and they transplanted it all

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.173
over the Eastern Mediterranean,
whether they were in Egypt or

00:18:04.173 --> 00:18:06.288
Syria or Asia Minor or anyplace
else.

00:18:06.288 --> 00:18:10.895
Which is why you can travel
right now to Turkey or Syria or

00:18:10.895 --> 00:18:15.425
Israel or Jordan or Egypt,
and you can see excavations of

00:18:15.425 --> 00:18:18.191
towns,
and it's remarkable how they

00:18:18.191 --> 00:18:23.009
all look so much alike,
because they're all inspired by

00:18:23.009 --> 00:18:26.818
this originally Greek model of
the city.

00:18:26.818 --> 00:18:29.548
So that's one of the most
important things about Alexander

00:18:29.548 --> 00:18:32.180
and his successors is they
Hellenized the entire eastern

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.224
Mediterranean,
and that meant every major city

00:18:35.224 --> 00:18:37.980
would have a certain commonality
to it.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.868
It would have a certain
koine to it;

00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:43.020
that is, a Greek overlay,
over what may be also be there,

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.230
the original indigenous kind of
cultures and languages.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.529
The other thing you have is
religious syncretism.

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:58.140
I didn't put that down,
so just in case.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:05.106
The Greek word synkresis
means "a mixing

00:19:05.106 --> 00:19:07.430
together."
 

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:11.924
When Alexander gets to Persia,
or let's say when he gets to

00:19:11.924 --> 00:19:15.259
Egypt, he knows that there is
this god Isis,

00:19:15.259 --> 00:19:18.980
this female god Isis,
that's very important.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.068
You see statues of her all over
the place.

00:19:21.068 --> 00:19:23.365
Well, Alexander just followed a
custom that had been taught by

00:19:23.365 --> 00:19:25.058
philosophy and other kinds of
things that,

00:19:25.058 --> 00:19:26.660
"Oh well,
they worship Isis."

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.598
But Isis is sort of like
Artemis.

00:19:30.598 --> 00:19:34.323
So sometimes you'd see they'd
make statues of Isis look like

00:19:34.323 --> 00:19:36.279
statues of Artemis back home.
 

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:40.940
Artemis is the Greek goddess
of--anybody know?

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.210
Student:  The hunt.
 

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.680
Prof: The hunt.
 

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:45.318
See all you guys really know
your Greek and Roman mythology.

00:19:45.318 --> 00:19:48.397
That shows that you did well on
your SATs I bet,

00:19:48.397 --> 00:19:49.250
didn't you?
 

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.338
So, we'll talk a bit about what
that means,

00:19:51.338 --> 00:19:53.259
with the different gods and
goddesses,

00:19:53.259 --> 00:19:56.047
and how you learned all this in
mythological courses and English

00:19:56.047 --> 00:19:56.799
in high school.
 

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:58.058
But we'll get back to that.
 

00:19:58.058 --> 00:20:00.538
But Artemis is the Goddess of
the Hunt.

00:20:00.538 --> 00:20:02.866
So these Greeks would say,
"Well, we have another

00:20:02.866 --> 00:20:05.326
Goddess of the Hunt,"
and you'd find other Goddesses

00:20:05.326 --> 00:20:06.028
of the Hunt.
 

00:20:06.028 --> 00:20:08.066
Or when they'd get to
Jerusalem, they'd see,

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:09.960
"Oh, these people worship
Yahweh.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.442
Well that's just Zeus,
that's just another name for

00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:12.788
Zeus.
 

00:20:12.788 --> 00:20:14.733
It's the same god,
they just have a different name

00:20:14.733 --> 00:20:15.328
for it."
 

00:20:15.328 --> 00:20:18.519
Alexander took this tendency of
syncretism,

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:20.218
of mixing together different
religious traditions from

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:22.009
different places,
and he used it as a

00:20:22.009 --> 00:20:24.250
self-conscious propaganda
technique.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.490
He even identified himself,
because he started claiming

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.170
divine status for himself.
 

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.471
He went around passing out
rumors that his mother had

00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:34.260
actually been impregnated by the
god Apollo, when he appeared as

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.279
a snake in her bed.
 

00:20:35.279 --> 00:20:38.730
So, Alexander is putting
himself forward as divine.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:39.460
Why?
 

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:43.012
This is not a Greek tradition,
but it's very much a tradition

00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:46.507
in the East for kings to be
considered by their people to be

00:20:46.507 --> 00:20:47.038
gods.
 

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:48.866
Alexander says,
"Well, if they can be

00:20:48.866 --> 00:20:50.160
gods, I can be a god."
 

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.430
So he starts spreading rumors
that he is divine himself.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.460
He probably even believed it.
 

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.315
I don't think he necessarily
lied about it,

00:20:55.315 --> 00:20:57.170
he probably believed that he
was divine.

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.184
And so he had a god father,
he had a human mother,

00:21:00.184 --> 00:21:03.816
and so then he would identify
himself with whoever was a god

00:21:03.816 --> 00:21:05.538
in the different places.
 

00:21:05.538 --> 00:21:09.690
So he would identify himself as
a Greek god with a Persian god.

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:12.880
He would identify the goddess
Isis with some Greek goddess.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.596
And so all the time these
different gods from different

00:21:16.596 --> 00:21:20.794
places were basically all said
to be simply different cultural

00:21:20.794 --> 00:21:23.130
representations,
different names,

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.358
for what were generally the
same gods all over the place.

00:21:26.358 --> 00:21:28.244
Also, though,
what they would do is sometimes

00:21:28.244 --> 00:21:30.730
they wouldn't try to simply say
these gods are the same.

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:32.990
What they would just do is add
on more gods.

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.919
They'd just say,
"Oh well,

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.715
we got to Egypt and we found
out there are a whole lot more

00:21:35.715 --> 00:21:36.769
gods than we knew about."
 

00:21:36.769 --> 00:21:39.192
Or they'd get to Syria,
"Look at all these god

00:21:39.192 --> 00:21:40.500
that the Syrians worship.
 

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.019
Well, we'll just add those into
our pantheon of gods too."

00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:46.996
And this is part of what
ancient religion was like,

00:21:46.996 --> 00:21:49.140
is that people were not
exclusive.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.640
You didn't have to worry.
 

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.750
Just because you worshiped one
god doesn't mean you couldn't

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.896
worship another god or several
gods or five gods or a hundred

00:21:54.896 --> 00:21:55.220
gods.
 

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.988
Gods knew that everybody
was--they weren't particularly

00:21:57.988 --> 00:21:59.269
jealous, in that sense.
 

00:21:59.269 --> 00:22:00.858
So this is the way people did
it.

00:22:00.858 --> 00:22:04.077
But what Alexander and his
successors did was they made

00:22:04.077 --> 00:22:07.928
sort of a conscious,
propagandistic decision to use

00:22:07.928 --> 00:22:12.390
religious syncretism to bind
together their kingdoms.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:15.987
Now this will become a problem
obviously when we talk about

00:22:15.987 --> 00:22:18.753
Judaism,
because Jews--the Greek rulers,

00:22:18.753 --> 00:22:22.251
were trying to do the same
thing with Jewish gods and

00:22:22.251 --> 00:22:24.519
Jewish figures,
as they had elsewhere.

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:27.584
And some Jews would go along
with this and some Jews would

00:22:27.584 --> 00:22:28.230
resist it.
 

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:31.009
The Romans, when they came on
the scene,

00:22:31.009 --> 00:22:32.528
in the East,
and they gradually became more

00:22:32.528 --> 00:22:35.917
and more powerful,
they destroyed Corinth in a big

00:22:35.917 --> 00:22:37.529
battle in 144 BCE.
 

00:22:37.529 --> 00:22:42.777
Pompey was the Roman general
who took over Jerusalem in 63

00:22:42.777 --> 00:22:43.328
BCE.
 

00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:47.779
So the Romans were in charge of
Judea from 63 BCE on.

00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:50.170
And this is very important,
because the Romans,

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:53.452
as their power grew in the
East, they simply moved

00:22:53.452 --> 00:22:57.404
increasingly into the eastern
Mediterranean and they adopted

00:22:57.404 --> 00:23:00.085
the whole Greek system,
the Greek world,

00:23:00.085 --> 00:23:02.450
and they didn't even try to
make it non-Greek.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.605
So Romans didn't go around
trying to get people in the East

00:23:05.605 --> 00:23:06.528
to speak Latin.
 

00:23:06.528 --> 00:23:10.617
They might put up an official
inscription in an Eastern city

00:23:10.617 --> 00:23:12.392
in Latin,
but they'd almost always,

00:23:12.392 --> 00:23:13.750
if it was an official
inscription,

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.298
it would also be listed in
Greek.

00:23:15.298 --> 00:23:18.519
So Romans who ruled in the East
were expected to speak Greek.

00:23:18.519 --> 00:23:21.846
And by this time all educated
Roman men were expected to be

00:23:21.846 --> 00:23:24.140
able to speak Greek,
well if possible.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.048
So the Romans didn't try to
make the East Roman,

00:23:27.048 --> 00:23:29.834
in that sense,
culturally, nor did they try to

00:23:29.834 --> 00:23:31.318
change the language.
 

00:23:31.318 --> 00:23:35.710
Greek language,
culture, and religions,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.558
different religions and the
syncretism,

00:23:38.558 --> 00:23:41.058
Greek education,
the polis structure--

00:23:41.058 --> 00:23:44.696
all of these things remained in
the East throughout the Roman

00:23:44.696 --> 00:23:47.847
rule of the East,
all the way up until the time

00:23:47.847 --> 00:23:51.660
you had a Christian emperor with
Constantine, and later.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.836
But there's one thing that the
Romans made even more of,

00:23:55.836 --> 00:24:00.165
than the Greeks had made of,
and this is the patron-client

00:24:00.165 --> 00:24:01.230
structure.
 

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.448
This is a bit more of a
distinctly Roman institution,

00:24:04.448 --> 00:24:06.118
even a legal institution.
 

00:24:06.118 --> 00:24:08.811
But it's important for
understanding both the Roman

00:24:08.811 --> 00:24:11.182
Empire, as well as early
Christianity and its

00:24:11.182 --> 00:24:12.690
patron-client relations.
 

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.970
The household structure of a
Roman household was this--

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:17.792
and I say
"household,"

00:24:17.792 --> 00:24:19.851
because our word
"family,"

00:24:19.851 --> 00:24:22.851
which we usually take to mean
the biological family:

00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:24.949
the father,
the mother, the children,

00:24:24.949 --> 00:24:27.509
maybe the grandchildren,
maybe the extended family.

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:31.006
But we usually mean by it the
immediate, the nuclear family,

00:24:31.006 --> 00:24:32.308
with some extension.
 

00:24:32.308 --> 00:24:34.828
That use of the English word
"family,"

00:24:34.828 --> 00:24:36.759
although it comes from the
Latin,

00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:38.530
familia,
means something totally

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.509
different in Latin.
 

00:24:39.509 --> 00:24:42.952
The Latin word familia
didn't mean that biological

00:24:42.952 --> 00:24:43.690
kin group.
 

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:47.029
It actually was originally used
for the slaves of a household.

00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:49.460
The slaves and the freed
persons of a Roman household

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.890
were legally the ones who were
the familia.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:54.608
But so when I say
"family"--

00:24:54.608 --> 00:24:57.421
we try to avoid even talking
about "the Roman

00:24:57.421 --> 00:24:59.529
family,"
because it means something so

00:24:59.529 --> 00:25:01.890
different to them than what it
means to us.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.445
So I'll tend to talk about
"the Roman household,"

00:25:05.445 --> 00:25:08.878
because that's what's more
meaningful sociologically when

00:25:08.878 --> 00:25:10.288
we talk about this.
 

00:25:10.288 --> 00:25:13.980
The Roman household was
constructed like a pyramid.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.298
Imagine this as a pyramid and
not a triangle.

00:25:17.298 --> 00:25:22.598
At the top of it is the head of
the household,

00:25:22.598 --> 00:25:26.838
the man, the
paterfamilias.

00:25:26.838 --> 00:25:29.405
And increasingly you'll
actually see this written in the

00:25:29.405 --> 00:25:31.460
New York Times or used in
politics.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.124
But it comes from the Latin,
and it referred to the head of

00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:35.630
the household;
pater,

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:38.828
father, familias is the
household, the family.

00:25:38.828 --> 00:25:44.308
The paterfamilias is the
oldest man of the household.

00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:51.113
Under him is his sons,
his daughters,

00:25:51.113 --> 00:26:01.317
and then at the bottom are his
slaves, and here are his

00:26:01.317 --> 00:26:06.608
freedmen, freed persons.
 

00:26:06.608 --> 00:26:09.987
And then also you consider,
in some ways,

00:26:09.987 --> 00:26:13.278
free people who may exist as
clients.

00:26:13.278 --> 00:26:18.431
But legally the word
client in Latin refers to

00:26:18.431 --> 00:26:22.788
the freed slaves of
apaterfamilias.

00:26:22.788 --> 00:26:27.200
Now where's the wife in this
picture?

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:32.180
Notice, I didn't put the wife
and the mother in there.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.470
Why is that?
 

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:37.207
Because legally she's actually
not part of this man's

00:26:37.207 --> 00:26:38.068
household.
 

00:26:38.068 --> 00:26:41.308
She remains part of the
household of her father,

00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:45.306
and she's legally under the
control of her father probably,

00:26:45.306 --> 00:26:48.269
or her brothers,
if her father is dead;

00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:50.890
or her grandfather if her
grandfather is still alive.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.143
But since life expectancy in
the Ancient World was much less

00:26:53.143 --> 00:26:55.094
than ours,
you didn't have usually several

00:26:55.094 --> 00:26:58.608
generations in these households,
because older people just died.

00:26:58.608 --> 00:27:02.393
The wife though is legally a
part of her own household over

00:27:02.393 --> 00:27:02.849
here.
 

00:27:02.849 --> 00:27:04.318
Why did the Romans do that?
 

00:27:04.318 --> 00:27:06.086
That's very different from the
Greeks, very different from

00:27:06.086 --> 00:27:07.450
other people in the Ancient
Mediterranean.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.365
Why did they want to make sure
that the daughters stayed in the

00:27:11.365 --> 00:27:13.259
households of their fathers?
 

00:27:13.259 --> 00:27:17.853
They did this because they
didn't want the upper-class in

00:27:17.853 --> 00:27:19.755
Rome,
who were the elite,

00:27:19.755 --> 00:27:22.180
they didn't want any one
household,

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.446
or any small group of
households, to become too

00:27:24.446 --> 00:27:24.990
powerful.
 

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.240
And if you have women marrying
off into other families,

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.048
and then they leave the
household of their fathers,

00:27:31.048 --> 00:27:33.330
and they are officially and
legally in a household with

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:35.586
somebody else,
that may end up increasing

00:27:35.586 --> 00:27:38.959
those households that have
intermarriage coming in and not

00:27:38.959 --> 00:27:41.029
so much intermarriage going out.
 

00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:44.589
By keeping women under the
household of the men of their

00:27:44.589 --> 00:27:47.669
original family,
the upper-class Romans tried to

00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:50.354
balance these different
households in size and

00:27:50.354 --> 00:27:51.190
importance.
 

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.960
They didn't care about the
lower-class really.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:55.200
The lower-class didn't really
count much.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.077
What they cared about--because
the Roman Republic by this time

00:27:59.077 --> 00:28:02.509
was basically a bunch of very
important households,

00:28:02.509 --> 00:28:05.288
wealthy men and their
households, and they were the

00:28:05.288 --> 00:28:07.912
members of the Senate,
they were the knight class,

00:28:07.912 --> 00:28:09.509
they were the people who ran
Rome.

00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:12.990
So they didn't want one king to
arise, and they didn't want a

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.078
small coterie of leaders to
arise.

00:28:15.078 --> 00:28:18.199
They wanted there to be some
kind of balance of power among

00:28:18.199 --> 00:28:21.480
the several major households of
Rome, the families of Rome.

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:25.000
Now slaves obviously are in
the paterfamilias.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.288
When a slave is freed--and in
the Ancient World,

00:28:27.288 --> 00:28:29.185
in the Roman Empire,
most slaves were eventually

00:28:29.185 --> 00:28:31.410
freed,
unless they just died before

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.470
long--they became a freed man.
 

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.710
They didn't become a free man,
they became a freed man,

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.690
and that was legally different.
 

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:42.159
So the status of slave was
lowest, freed persons was next

00:28:42.159 --> 00:28:45.318
highest in Roman Law;,
and free people were next.

00:28:45.318 --> 00:28:48.182
But even though they became
freed, they were still

00:28:48.182 --> 00:28:50.694
considered a member of this
guy's household,

00:28:50.694 --> 00:28:52.740
as his client and his freedman.
 

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:54.588
And they owed certain duties to
him.

00:28:54.588 --> 00:28:55.529
For example,
they

00:28:55.529 --> 00:28:58.820
might--paterfamilias
would often put a slave up in

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.230
business, give a slave enough
money to run a business.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.482
And the slave could keep a lot
of the income from that business

00:29:05.482 --> 00:29:08.737
for himself, and the slave could
actually gather together a bit

00:29:08.737 --> 00:29:10.048
of money for himself.
 

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:11.808
He couldn't legally own the
money;

00:29:11.808 --> 00:29:14.028
his master legally owned
everything the slave owned.

00:29:14.028 --> 00:29:16.578
But, practically,
and in some legal contexts,

00:29:16.578 --> 00:29:19.398
what they would do is they'd
allow the slave the use of that

00:29:19.398 --> 00:29:21.271
money,
and that's called the

00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:22.440
peculium.
 

00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:28.618
Now when this slave is freed,
by the owner,

00:29:28.618 --> 00:29:31.358
the slave could take the
peculium with him,

00:29:31.358 --> 00:29:33.250
and then he could set up his
own business,

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:35.269
but he'd still be a client of
the owner,

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:38.548
because he's still officially
part of his household.

00:29:38.548 --> 00:29:41.323
So this maintained,
even when--why would a person

00:29:41.323 --> 00:29:42.190
free a slave?
 

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.104
Well if you have a slave,
that slave can't actually sign

00:29:45.104 --> 00:29:45.740
contracts.
 

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.344
The slave might be your
business manager,

00:29:47.344 --> 00:29:49.190
but all the slave could do is
the paperwork.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.578
But if you need a slave
representing your business,

00:29:51.578 --> 00:29:54.029
and you live in Rome and you
need somebody in Ostia,

00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:56.226
the port city of Rome,
to be able to be there and

00:29:56.226 --> 00:29:58.788
watch your imports and your
exports of your business,

00:29:58.788 --> 00:30:00.500
you need someone who can sign
contracts,

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.839
who can lend money,
who can borrow money,

00:30:02.839 --> 00:30:03.970
who can do things like that.
 

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.720
Slaves can't do that legally,
but freedmen can.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.961
So rich Romans were often
freeing slaves for their own

00:30:11.961 --> 00:30:13.048
purposes.
 

00:30:13.048 --> 00:30:15.288
It was not like they were
giving them a great deal,

00:30:15.288 --> 00:30:18.019
this was part of constructing
their own business expansion.

00:30:18.019 --> 00:30:20.800
Sons and daughters,
though, were still part of the

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.150
household, as long as the
paterfamilias was alive.

00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.887
So sons legally were still
under their

00:30:25.887 --> 00:30:26.970
paterfamilias.
 

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:30.358
Now this is all legally and
officially what's the case.

00:30:30.358 --> 00:30:32.798
You wouldn't really see this
working all like this.

00:30:32.798 --> 00:30:34.472
For example,
I said wives were not really

00:30:34.472 --> 00:30:35.980
part of their husband's
household.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.888
Legally, that's correct,
but you see cases in letters

00:30:38.888 --> 00:30:41.967
and all kinds of stuff from the
Ancient World that women

00:30:41.967 --> 00:30:45.660
actually were more unofficially
part of their husband's house.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.509
They ran it when he was away,
for example.

00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:50.236
They told his slave--she might
have her own slaves and her own

00:30:50.236 --> 00:30:52.962
property, the wife had her own
property that was separate from

00:30:52.962 --> 00:30:54.170
the husband's property.
 

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:56.807
But in practical purposes most
of the time, they didn't--they

00:30:56.807 --> 00:30:59.618
just mixed these together and
they might use different things.

00:30:59.618 --> 00:31:03.421
So the legal situation was set
up to try to keep the wife's

00:31:03.421 --> 00:31:06.240
ownership as part of a different
family,

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.630
and so her money didn't go to
her husband,

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.328
and his money didn't go to her.
 

00:31:10.328 --> 00:31:13.096
But this was a legal situation
to try to keep this balance of

00:31:13.096 --> 00:31:14.250
power among households.
 

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.055
Practically,
sons didn't all live in the

00:31:16.055 --> 00:31:17.490
same place with their father.
 

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.096
They would get married and move
off to an apartment or someplace

00:31:20.096 --> 00:31:21.670
down the street,
or to another city.

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:23.578
But this is the legal situation.
 

00:31:23.578 --> 00:31:27.880
Now when you go to jail--I mean
when you go to court,

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.251
slaves of course can't
represent themselves in court at

00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:32.858
all,
they don't have any legal

00:31:32.858 --> 00:31:33.779
standing.
 

00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:36.569
But if you're a freedman
you're--the other thing I should

00:31:36.569 --> 00:31:39.808
tell you is that in Roman law if
you're manumitted as a slave,

00:31:39.808 --> 00:31:42.059
you're made free,
if you're manumitted in the

00:31:42.059 --> 00:31:44.877
normal way they did it,
that makes you a Roman citizen,

00:31:44.877 --> 00:31:46.559
if your owner was a Roman
citizen.

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:47.818
Notice what this means.
 

00:31:47.818 --> 00:31:51.583
Only in the Roman Empire could
slavery actually start being a

00:31:51.583 --> 00:31:54.029
way that you can move up in
society,

00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:56.670
because you could--if you were
a talented slave,

00:31:56.670 --> 00:31:59.269
your owner might free you,
probably would free you.

00:31:59.269 --> 00:32:01.557
When he freed you,
if he was a Roman citizen,

00:32:01.557 --> 00:32:04.208
you would automatically become
a Roman citizen also,

00:32:04.208 --> 00:32:06.598
and your children would be
Roman citizens.

00:32:06.598 --> 00:32:08.844
And although you were a
freedman, which was lower in

00:32:08.844 --> 00:32:11.267
status than a free person--
there were some privileges you

00:32:11.267 --> 00:32:12.934
couldn't have--
your children would be,

00:32:12.934 --> 00:32:14.910
if they were born after you'd
been freed,

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.660
would be free people, not freed.
 

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.353
So within a couple of
generations people could move up

00:32:21.353 --> 00:32:25.535
from being the lowest slaves to
two generations of being free

00:32:25.535 --> 00:32:26.858
Roman citizens.
 

00:32:26.858 --> 00:32:29.987
So Roman slavery and the
freedom of that was actually one

00:32:29.987 --> 00:32:33.170
way that a few people in the
Ancient World recognized some

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:36.868
kind of social mobility,
which was very rare in the

00:32:36.868 --> 00:32:37.990
Roman Empire.
 

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:42.259
Any questions about any of that?
 

00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:45.759
Now why is this important for
the rest of this stuff?

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:49.238
This will be very important
because Christians started out

00:32:49.238 --> 00:32:52.013
as house churches,
and their house churches fit

00:32:52.013 --> 00:32:54.630
sometimes the model of a
Greek ekklesia,

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.924
an assembly,
but sometimes the model of the

00:32:56.924 --> 00:32:57.910
Roman household.
 

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:01.015
And so this household structure
becomes very important for the

00:33:01.015 --> 00:33:03.915
growth and structure and even
the theology of Christianity

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:04.680
eventually.
 

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.368
This is also important though
for Roman politics,

00:33:07.368 --> 00:33:09.873
because if you're if a
freedman, or even if you're a

00:33:09.873 --> 00:33:12.016
free person--
sometimes see freemen would

00:33:12.016 --> 00:33:15.351
connect themselves to a powerful
Roman who was higher status than

00:33:15.351 --> 00:33:17.462
them,
because they could use him for

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:18.450
important things.
 

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.036
For example,
say you want to take your

00:33:20.036 --> 00:33:21.836
neighbor to court,
because your neighbor is

00:33:21.836 --> 00:33:23.380
starting impinging on your land.
 

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.210
Well if you're of lower status,
lower social status,

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:27.920
the judge is going to look at
you and say,

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.259
"Come on, you're poor,
your neighbor's rich,

00:33:31.259 --> 00:33:33.118
I'm going to side for the
neighbor."

00:33:33.118 --> 00:33:35.073
Because Roman legal
structures--and they even said

00:33:35.073 --> 00:33:37.086
this in Roman laws--
if you're a judge and you have

00:33:37.086 --> 00:33:38.680
a rich man and a poor man in
your court,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.500
of course you're going to
decide for the rich man,

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:45.450
because the poor man has
incentive to cheat;

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:46.598
he's poor.
 

00:33:46.598 --> 00:33:48.335
But the rich man already has
money, he doesn't have any

00:33:48.335 --> 00:33:49.009
incentive to cheat.
 

00:33:49.009 --> 00:33:51.039
That's their logic.
 

00:33:51.039 --> 00:33:52.288
&gt;
 

00:33:52.288 --> 00:33:55.955
But so Roman legal system was
really geared toward the wealthy

00:33:55.955 --> 00:33:57.880
and the people of high status.
 

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.875
For that reason,
if you wanted to win a court

00:34:00.875 --> 00:34:02.599
case,
it helped--or have somebody

00:34:02.599 --> 00:34:04.828
represent you in politics or all
kinds of things--

00:34:04.828 --> 00:34:07.390
it helped to have strong
patrons.

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.440
So you'd have a patron who
would be higher class,

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:11.550
richer, more powerful,
have some political power,

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.829
and you would be loyal to your
patron,

00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:16.300
and your patron would then
represent you in court,

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.389
try to get you jobs,
try to get you more business,

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.110
do all the kinds of things that
patrons do for their clients.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:25.324
Also, if your patron wanted to
run for a city office,

00:34:25.324 --> 00:34:30.190
your patron would expect you to
be loyal and vote for him.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.699
So lower-class people--now what
happens,

00:34:32.699 --> 00:34:36.139
though, when you have--see your
clients,

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:38.070
your freedmen,
your sons, your daughters,

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.099
all these are part of this
pyramid structure,

00:34:40.099 --> 00:34:43.070
and they all benefit from a
strong paterfamilias,

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.490
and he benefits by having a
strong household and a large

00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:46.018
household.
 

00:34:46.018 --> 00:34:48.849
But most of the free citizens
of the Roman Empire,

00:34:48.849 --> 00:34:51.431
of Rome, were poor
people--free,

00:34:51.431 --> 00:34:54.719
and even citizens,
but they were poor people who

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.630
weren't part of any rich
household.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:58.170
So what do you have with all
these other people,

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:01.784
these other Romans around here,
who don't have a powerful

00:35:01.784 --> 00:35:03.358
patron,
who don't have a powerful

00:35:03.358 --> 00:35:04.809
paterfamilias to help
them out?

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:07.989
This is where Julius Caesar was
quite the genius.

00:35:07.989 --> 00:35:18.010
Julius Caesar came from a
patrician family--

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:22.800
that is, a family,
an aristocratic family--

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.981
but he started siding with a
party in Rome called the

00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:28.510
populares.
 

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:31.739
And I think this is on your
handout; correct?

00:35:31.739 --> 00:35:34.532
The Roman Senate,
in the late part of the

00:35:34.532 --> 00:35:39.139
Republic--yes--started dividing
itself into two sort of parties;

00:35:39.139 --> 00:35:40.840
not official parties,
but factions.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.279
The optimates,
meaning "the best,"

00:35:44.279 --> 00:35:48.543
tended to support the interests
of the wealthy senators and the

00:35:48.543 --> 00:35:50.469
few wealthiest families.
 

00:35:50.469 --> 00:35:54.063
The populares started
representing the interests of

00:35:54.063 --> 00:35:55.639
everybody else in Rome.
 

00:35:55.639 --> 00:35:57.753
Populares just comes
from the word for "the

00:35:57.753 --> 00:35:58.340
people."
 

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.340
Julius Caesar was from one of
these aristocratic,

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.824
patrician families,
although his family didn't have

00:36:03.824 --> 00:36:05.525
a lot of money,
they weren't really,

00:36:05.525 --> 00:36:06.170
really wealthy.
 

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:10.653
But he had great birth,
and so he started getting more

00:36:10.653 --> 00:36:14.969
power politically and
financially by setting himself

00:36:14.969 --> 00:36:18.268
up as the patron of the
patronless.

00:36:18.268 --> 00:36:21.268
Also, generals ran their armies
this way.

00:36:21.268 --> 00:36:23.873
So Julius Caesar--if you were
really going to be important in

00:36:23.873 --> 00:36:26.130
Rome, you had to serve as a
general at some point.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:30.684
Julius Caesar capitalized on
his role as a general of a large

00:36:30.684 --> 00:36:34.402
army that was at the time
winning battles in Gaul,

00:36:34.402 --> 00:36:35.768
modern France.
 

00:36:35.768 --> 00:36:39.875
One example about this is
how--Julius Caesar was the

00:36:39.875 --> 00:36:42.061
patron,
the paterfamilias,

00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:43.454
in a sense,
of his army,

00:36:43.454 --> 00:36:45.929
his soldiers--is that one time
the Senate,

00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:49.599
who got nervous about Julius's
growth in popularity and power,

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:53.820
they wanted to take some
legions, some Roman legions,

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:57.418
away from Julius Caesar in
Gaul, and send them to another

00:36:57.418 --> 00:36:58.639
general in Syria.
 

00:36:58.639 --> 00:37:01.561
The reason they did this was
because they wanted to take some

00:37:01.561 --> 00:37:02.780
of Julius's power away.
 

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.440
They were afraid he was going
to set himself as dictator,

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.630
which of course he did.
 

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:08.485
So they took these Roman
legions away,

00:37:08.485 --> 00:37:09.989
and they sent them to Syria.
 

00:37:09.989 --> 00:37:12.304
When they left,
Julius Caesar,

00:37:12.304 --> 00:37:16.213
out of his own pocket,
gave every soldier in those

00:37:16.213 --> 00:37:18.210
legions a year's pay.
 

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.760
This is what patrons do,
you see.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.697
He bought the loyalty of his
soldiers, when they were being

00:37:24.697 --> 00:37:26.530
taken out of his control.
 

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:32.030
This is the patron-client
structure at work in the Roman

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.730
army.
 

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.329
Julius also,
then, set himself up in the

00:37:35.329 --> 00:37:38.730
city, when he started gaining
more power in Rome.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:42.429
Actually he gained power in
Rome mainly by military might,

00:37:42.429 --> 00:37:45.219
by kind of making the Senate
nervous and winning a few

00:37:45.219 --> 00:37:47.679
battles,
and that was against the law.

00:37:47.679 --> 00:37:49.706
It was against the law for
Julius Caesar to do that,

00:37:49.706 --> 00:37:50.619
but he did it anyway.
 

00:37:50.619 --> 00:37:52.889
He tried to consolidate his
power, though,

00:37:52.889 --> 00:37:56.045
by putting forth policies that
moderately helped the lower

00:37:56.045 --> 00:37:56.710
classes.
 

00:37:56.710 --> 00:38:00.650
He didn't cancel debts,
but he mitigated debts.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:06.039
He eased some of the strains on
the poor.

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:09.018
He was assassinated by
conservative Senate forces--

00:38:09.018 --> 00:38:12.530
you know, Brutus and Cassius
and others--

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.969
on the Ides of March,
as you all know,

00:38:14.969 --> 00:38:18.960
March 15^(th), 44 BCE.
 

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.880
He had adopted another Roman,
Octavian,

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:26.300
and Julius Caesar's adopted
son, Octavian,

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.099
then formed an alliance with
Mark Antony,

00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:30.429
who had been Julius Caesar's
friend,

00:38:30.429 --> 00:38:33.010
and a lesser known figure named
Lepidus,

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.139
whom you don't really need to
remember.

00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:37.891
Because at the end it turned
out that Mark Antony and

00:38:37.891 --> 00:38:39.480
Octavian fought a civil war.
 

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:45.190
Octavian won,
and Octavian defeated Mark

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:46.510
Antony.
 

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:48.920
And by this time Mark Antony
had palled up with Cleopatra,

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.469
Queen of Egypt,
and Octavian beat both of them,

00:38:52.469 --> 00:38:58.590
and he became the sole ruler of
the empire in 27 BCE.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:01.994
He refused the title of king,
and he took the traditional

00:39:01.994 --> 00:39:03.210
Republican titles.
 

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.652
One of his propagandists said
this about him:

00:39:06.652 --> 00:39:11.114
"The pristine form of the
Republic was recalled as of

00:39:11.114 --> 00:39:12.210
old."
 

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.199
Or Augustus--he had taken the
title Augustus by this time,

00:39:15.199 --> 00:39:17.289
which means "the
great"--

00:39:17.289 --> 00:39:19.271
he himself said,
"I transferred the

00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:22.268
Republic from my power to the
dominion of the Senate and the

00:39:22.268 --> 00:39:23.539
people of Rome."
 

00:39:23.539 --> 00:39:25.695
In other words,
in his propaganda,

00:39:25.695 --> 00:39:28.478
Augustus basically said,
"I'm not a king,

00:39:28.478 --> 00:39:31.358
I'm just another senator,
and I'm giving the Senate and

00:39:31.358 --> 00:39:33.469
the people all their power
back."

00:39:33.469 --> 00:39:36.929
A lie, all lies.
 

00:39:36.929 --> 00:39:40.119
See, lying in government didn't
start with our government.

00:39:40.119 --> 00:39:43.391
So Augustus actually
reconstituted the Senate,

00:39:43.391 --> 00:39:47.027
and it was just that,
a Senate reconstituted by the

00:39:47.027 --> 00:39:47.900
emperor.
 

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.800
He became more and more the
patron of all the people.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.402
And this is the way the emperor
would forever then try to

00:39:54.402 --> 00:39:55.239
present himself.
 

00:39:55.239 --> 00:39:57.018
He and his family,
the emperor's family,

00:39:57.018 --> 00:40:00.780
was, in a sense,
the patron for the whole people

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:03.702
of the Roman Empire--
at least for all the

00:40:03.702 --> 00:40:06.679
Romans--the paterfamilias
of the entire empire.

00:40:06.679 --> 00:40:10.170
This led to what we famously
call the Pax Romana,

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:14.340
"the Roman Peace,"
because you had the end of

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:16.193
long,
hundreds of years of civil wars

00:40:16.193 --> 00:40:18.900
and other wars,
at least within Rome itself.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.900
There were always battles and
wars going on,

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.903
on the boundaries,
the frontiers of the Roman

00:40:22.903 --> 00:40:25.077
Empire,
but within the center of the

00:40:25.077 --> 00:40:27.840
empire there was an amazing
period of peace.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.418
Most people saw this
peace--many people in history

00:40:31.418 --> 00:40:32.659
say it is good.
 

00:40:32.659 --> 00:40:36.570
It's debatable whether it was
good for everybody.

00:40:36.570 --> 00:40:40.791
Non-Romans and poor people may
have seen the Pax Romana

00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:43.559
as more oppressive than a
liberation,

00:40:43.559 --> 00:40:49.619
just like people saw the Pax
Americana that way,

00:40:49.619 --> 00:40:51.809
after the collapse of the
Soviet Union and before the

00:40:51.809 --> 00:40:52.989
beginning of the Iraq War.
 

00:40:52.989 --> 00:40:56.050
The Romans maintained peace,
for one thing,

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:59.463
by leaving local populations
pretty much alone when it came

00:40:59.463 --> 00:41:02.001
to local customs,
religions, and living

00:41:02.001 --> 00:41:02.909
arrangements.
 

00:41:02.909 --> 00:41:06.018
When they thought it was
necessary, they maintained peace

00:41:06.018 --> 00:41:09.349
by destroying communities and
forcibly moving populations.

00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:11.992
But they tried to do that only
when they needed to do so to

00:41:11.992 --> 00:41:13.360
keep their absolute control.
 

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.960
The Romans prospered by
taxation.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.219
They did hold censuses,
not universal ones as mentioned

00:41:19.219 --> 00:41:21.152
in the Bible,
but local censuses,

00:41:21.152 --> 00:41:23.989
in order to keep taxes high and
fully paid.

00:41:23.989 --> 00:41:26.190
But they didn't--the Romans
themselves didn't want to be

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.510
bothered with collecting taxes.
 

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:31.760
So they would have local,
sort of higher class,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.282
local elites,
would bid for the right to

00:41:34.282 --> 00:41:37.313
collect local taxes,
and so the Romans would take

00:41:37.313 --> 00:41:38.250
the highest bid.
 

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:39.340
In other words,
if I'm a rich,

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:40.885
wealthy person in Corinth,
I would say,

00:41:40.885 --> 00:41:42.409
"I'll be the local tax
collector,

00:41:42.409 --> 00:41:45.356
and I'll guarantee you I'll
send to Rome this amount of

00:41:45.356 --> 00:41:46.719
money for a year."
 

00:41:46.719 --> 00:41:49.894
Of course, the Romans didn't
care then how much I charged

00:41:49.894 --> 00:41:52.219
you, the people of Corinth in
its area.

00:41:52.219 --> 00:41:54.351
Actually the City of Corinth
wouldn't have been taxed because

00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:56.010
it was a Roman colony,
and one of the benefits of

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:57.789
being a Roman colony is that you
didn't have to pay taxes,

00:41:57.789 --> 00:41:59.829
or at least the citizens didn't
have to pay taxes.

00:41:59.829 --> 00:42:02.650
But the people in the outlying
villages and towns and farms and

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:03.969
everything would pay taxes.
 

00:42:03.969 --> 00:42:07.260
And if I'm the tax collector,
the way I make a profit is by

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.610
charging you a lot more than I
need just to send to Rome.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:11.739
The Romans didn't care about
this.

00:42:11.739 --> 00:42:12.730
They just knew it was going to
happen.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.239
This was the way they collected
their taxes.

00:42:14.239 --> 00:42:16.902
This is why the word "tax
collector"

00:42:16.902 --> 00:42:19.920
is such a bad word,
for everybody but the Romans;

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.344
why you'll see in the gospels
the term "tax collectors

00:42:23.344 --> 00:42:24.405
and sinners."
 

00:42:24.405 --> 00:42:24.820
Why?
 

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:28.074
Because the Jews didn't like
the tax collectors because they

00:42:28.074 --> 00:42:29.840
were being ripped off by them.
 

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.039
Is your hand up?
 

00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:33.914
Student:  Did Matthew
come from a rich background

00:42:33.914 --> 00:42:34.280
then?
 

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.050
Prof: Well,
number one, we'll talk about

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:38.980
who the historical Matthew is.
 

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.856
The figure in Matthew,
in the Gospel of Matthew,

00:42:42.856 --> 00:42:46.650
we don't know much about his
actual history.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:47.860
He just appears.
 

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.012
But when it calls him a
"tax collector,"

00:42:50.012 --> 00:42:52.474
it doesn't necessarily mean
that he was the one who owned

00:42:52.474 --> 00:42:53.969
the right for that whole area.
 

00:42:53.969 --> 00:42:56.639
It just means he was--he
could've been hired by somebody

00:42:56.639 --> 00:42:59.599
to sit at a roadside and collect
taxes and tolls and stuff.

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:01.206
So the word "tax
collector"

00:43:01.206 --> 00:43:03.619
didn't necessarily mean that
the person themselves were

00:43:03.619 --> 00:43:07.588
wealthy,
but whoever had the tax--what's

00:43:07.588 --> 00:43:12.963
the thing I'm looking for?--
franchise, whoever had the tax

00:43:12.963 --> 00:43:16.931
franchise for that area would be
someone from a wealthy

00:43:16.931 --> 00:43:17.960
background.
 

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.190
But then you'd hire out other
people to do the taxes.

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.768
So these people,
of course, were very unpopular.

00:43:22.768 --> 00:43:27.746
The Romans maintained peace to
a great extent by keeping the

00:43:27.746 --> 00:43:28.760
poor poor.
 

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:33.079
So the Pax Romana may
have sounded great,

00:43:33.079 --> 00:43:36.050
if you were an elite,
but if you were not in the

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:37.952
elite,
it may have seemed more

00:43:37.952 --> 00:43:39.460
oppressive than anything.
 

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.760
There were some other benefits,
though, that the Romans did.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.860
They made travel much easier.
 

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:46.210
Pompey had cleared the
Mediterranean of pirates,

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.159
which is something that our
governments can't seem to do.

00:43:49.159 --> 00:43:52.969
They built roads,
maintained some communication.

00:43:52.969 --> 00:43:55.751
They had a mail service,
although it was for official

00:43:55.751 --> 00:43:56.340
use only.
 

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.940
But this meant that you could
get--at least the Roman

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.539
officials could get mail
delivered fairly quickly.

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:04.639
They used even a horseback
relay that could go a hundred

00:44:04.639 --> 00:44:05.710
kilometers a day.
 

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:09.079
Soldiers were expected to be
able travel thirty kilometers

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:10.500
per day, in full pack.
 

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:12.920
And that was only possible
because,

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:15.268
besides using the sea,
the shipping lanes for travel,

00:44:15.268 --> 00:44:17.019
which was much faster than
overland travel,

00:44:17.019 --> 00:44:18.880
the Romans maintained roads.
 

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.110
They didn't really care about
roads for everybody else.

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:22.420
They wanted the roads for their
Army,

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:25.849
just like the US Interstate
system was originally created in

00:44:25.849 --> 00:44:29.512
case the Army needed to be moved
across the country very quickly

00:44:29.512 --> 00:44:31.139
if the Soviets attacked.
 

00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:32.480
So this is the same way with
the Romans.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:34.864
They built roads for the army,
but of course other people used

00:44:34.864 --> 00:44:35.489
the roads too.
 

00:44:35.489 --> 00:44:38.722
This was why Christianity and
other things were able to spread

00:44:38.722 --> 00:44:41.849
so easily, why Paul was able to
travel around the empire.

00:44:41.849 --> 00:44:43.876
He would prefer to go by sea,
if possible,

00:44:43.876 --> 00:44:46.697
because it's much quicker,
but at least he could travel on

00:44:46.697 --> 00:44:49.219
the roads that the Romans built
and maintained.

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.163
As far as religion--Ehrman
talks about this in your

00:44:51.163 --> 00:44:54.164
textbook,
so I won't go into a lot of

00:44:54.164 --> 00:44:56.597
detail--
but the common Hollywood idea

00:44:56.597 --> 00:44:59.940
that the Romans were kind of
oppressive of other religions,

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:01.626
or the Christians,
is just that,

00:45:01.626 --> 00:45:02.659
a Hollywood idea.
 

00:45:02.659 --> 00:45:04.989
The Romans actually were very
tolerant of local religions.

00:45:04.989 --> 00:45:06.679
They didn't care what gods you
worshipped.

00:45:06.679 --> 00:45:08.896
The Romans actually were very
pious in the sense that they

00:45:08.896 --> 00:45:10.610
believed that whatever land they
were in,

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:14.849
they should provide sacrifices
and honors for the local gods,

00:45:14.849 --> 00:45:16.969
especially the important ones.
 

00:45:16.969 --> 00:45:20.349
So the Romans would honor local
gods, other people's gods.

00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:22.670
Every people was allowed to use
their own gods.

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:24.737
Jews, for example,
since the time of Julius

00:45:24.737 --> 00:45:26.364
Caesar,
who befriended the Jews because

00:45:26.364 --> 00:45:27.829
they helped him out politically
a lot,

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:29.820
he gave them certain privileges.
 

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.655
Jews didn't have to--they could
observe the Sabbath,

00:45:31.655 --> 00:45:33.817
they didn't have to do things
on the Sabbath that they didn't

00:45:33.817 --> 00:45:34.250
want to.
 

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:35.380
They didn't have to serve in
the army.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.170
They got to observe their own
religions.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.663
They weren't expected to
sacrifice, either to the emperor

00:45:40.663 --> 00:45:41.510
or to other gods.
 

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.219
So the Romans,
basically, were very tolerant.

00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:47.835
When they weren't tolerant was
when some religious group or

00:45:47.835 --> 00:45:51.139
club started looking like they
might be rebellious.

00:45:51.139 --> 00:45:53.300
If they started looking like
insurrection would happen,

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.340
the Romans didn't do it.
 

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:55.608
So the Romans,
for example,

00:45:55.608 --> 00:45:57.510
outlawed volunteer fire
departments,

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:00.411
in local places,
because they were afraid that

00:46:00.411 --> 00:46:04.280
volunteer fire departments could
be a place where locals,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.969
especially maybe lower-class
locals,

00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:08.782
could get together and then
start gossiping about what they

00:46:08.782 --> 00:46:10.869
could do to cause trouble for
the Romans.

00:46:10.869 --> 00:46:14.061
So the Romans were only
concerned about religions when

00:46:14.061 --> 00:46:17.615
it looked like those religions
were going to cause political

00:46:17.615 --> 00:46:18.400
problems.
 

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.969
As we'll see next time,
Jews fell into the system in

00:46:20.969 --> 00:46:22.079
many different ways.
 

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:25.119
Sometimes they were relatively
happy clients of the Romans.

00:46:25.119 --> 00:46:28.219
Sometimes they were subversive
enemies of the Roman order.

00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:30.914
As I said, they were officially
recognized by the Romans,

00:46:30.914 --> 00:46:33.130
but this caused problems for
Jews sometimes.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.431
In Alexandria,
the local Egyptian population

00:46:36.431 --> 00:46:40.731
resented the Jews because they
were recognized as a legal

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:44.494
ethnicity in Alexandria,
and they weren't given complete

00:46:44.494 --> 00:46:47.679
privileges of the Greeks in--
Alexandria was a Greek city.

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:50.510
So they were Greek speaking,
maybe people of Greek descent.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:52.865
But if they had fully adopted
Greek customs,

00:46:52.865 --> 00:46:54.510
they were considered Greeks.
 

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.722
The Jews were not considered
Greeks, but at least they were

00:46:57.722 --> 00:47:00.989
higher in status in Alexandrian
law than local Egyptians.

00:47:00.989 --> 00:47:05.018
The Egyptians were the lowest
in the city.

00:47:05.018 --> 00:47:07.920
So the local Egyptians resented
the Jews, because the Jews were

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.117
recognized as their own
ethnicity and given some

00:47:10.117 --> 00:47:10.820
privileges.
 

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.623
So this is why you sometimes
had Jews getting in trouble with

00:47:13.623 --> 00:47:16.518
local groups and had violence
with Jews in different places.

00:47:16.518 --> 00:47:18.889
And sure enough,
pogroms arise in places.

00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:22.255
Local people would attack the
Jews, or the Jews would try to

00:47:22.255 --> 00:47:24.992
set up an extra big meeting
house for themselves,

00:47:24.992 --> 00:47:27.159
and it would cause local
problems.

00:47:27.159 --> 00:47:29.550
But these were not problems
brought on by the Romans,

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:32.231
these were local problems,
and part of it was precisely

00:47:32.231 --> 00:47:34.813
because the Jews had been
recognized by the Romans as

00:47:34.813 --> 00:47:37.000
having a special status in some
places,

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.429
and this caused some kind of
local resentment.

00:47:39.429 --> 00:47:43.393
As we'll see,
though, the very fact that the

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:47.820
Romans had allowed this one
universal empire,

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:50.050
that had been created by
Alexander originally,

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.561
and with a Greek veneer,
and they allowed the West to

00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:56.329
stay Latin and the East to stay
Greek,

00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:58.480
and they melded these two
different things--

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.427
all of this was one of the
reasons that Christianity was

00:48:01.427 --> 00:48:04.000
able to spread at this time in
the way it did.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.835
In fact, you might even think
that had Jesus come and had Paul

00:48:08.835 --> 00:48:11.798
lived,
had they tried to spread this

00:48:11.798 --> 00:48:14.197
new group,
this new movement,

00:48:14.197 --> 00:48:16.969
at a time 500 years before
this,

00:48:16.969 --> 00:48:20.030
or 500 years afterwards,
it may have never happened.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.460
Because it was precisely
because of this one world,

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:25.239
run by the Romans and
maintained by the Romans,

00:48:25.239 --> 00:48:27.880
that allowed the spread of
Christianity,

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.864
to a great extent,
both ideologically and

00:48:30.864 --> 00:48:33.809
thought-wise,
as well as simply physically.

00:48:33.809 --> 00:48:37.570
Any questions?
 

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:38.730
Okay, time's up.
 

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:40.409
See you, not on Monday,
but on Wednesday.

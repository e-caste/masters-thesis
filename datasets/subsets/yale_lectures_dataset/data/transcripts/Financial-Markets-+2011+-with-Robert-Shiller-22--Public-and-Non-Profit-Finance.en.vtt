00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.870
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
All right.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.700
For this, the penultimate
lecture for ''Financial

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.490
Markets,'' I wanted to
talk about nonprofit

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.740
and government finance.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.740
So, let me first recall
some of the basic

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.810
themes of this course.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.080
Finance is really about
incentivizing people to do

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.930
good work, and managing risks.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.830
These issues are not confined to
the private sector, to the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.090
business sector.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:44.210
They're very deep and central
problems to all people.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.470
The big problem --

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.490
I'll put it in the most broad
terms -- just about everything

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.300
that we do that's good is
done as part of a team.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.050
It's hard to think
of something that

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.990
you alone can do.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.260
And so, the problem with teams
is, that people have their own

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.320
individual concerns and
incentives, and doesn't always

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.430
yield teamwork.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.700
So, that's what I think finance
is really about.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.780
You might think, I'm wrong,
and some of the greatest

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.510
achievements in history were
done by single individuals.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.700
So, I don't know, what
you might think of.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.080
What comes to my mind is, how
about Albert Einstein?

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.590
His theories, he was sitting
in a patent office in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.650
Switzerland, and just doodling
on a piece of paper, and came

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.805
up with the whole theory
of relativity.

00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:39.260
But you see, that would be
a mistake to think that,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.639
because, in fact, he had gotten
a PhD in physics from

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:49.530
the Zurich Polytechnic, which
is a nonprofit organization.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.870
And he relied on journals
of physics.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.340
He could not have done it, if
he didn't read what other

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.770
physicists were doing.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.920
And journals were organizations
that had

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.180
financing, I assume nonprofit.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.910
But I thought of another
example.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.650
Charles Darwin, the
great physicist --

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.000
not physicist, the great
naturalist. People pointed out

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.420
that he wasn't affiliated.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.970
He was on his own, he wasn't
part of a university.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.190
I guess, he got financing,
but kind of on his own.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.050
But he couldn't have
written The Origin

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.280
of Species by himself.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.220
In fact, he got financing from
private donors for the Beagle.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.060
You know, this two-year voyage
he made around the world,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.020
where he collected specimens
and information.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.870
And actually, he goes back
to his professor.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.010
He had a Professor Henslow at
Cambridge University, who was

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.670
a botanist. And Henslow arranged
for Darwin's voyage

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.030
and sent him off.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.120
So, these are organizations
that --

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.742
I don't think, you can do much
good [addition: without the

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:08.210
support of any organization].

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.540
Some people say, well,
how about a poet?

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.790
A poet?

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.415
Even Homer was a blind poet.

00:03:17.415 --> 00:03:19.060
He didn't have anything.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.270
He memorized everything.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.410
He didn't even write it down, he
just memorized everything.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.940
He just sat there and thought.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.470
But even he must have had
financing, because he traveled

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.320
around the world of his day
and made his poems known,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.730
otherwise they wouldn't
survive.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.420
Other people learned them.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.170
He must have had financing
for this.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.920
It must've been a business.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.630
So, that's the general theme.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.050
I'm going to talk today --

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.440
there's so much to
talk about --

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.500
I'm going to try to see, how
much of this I can cover well.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.480
I want to start by talking about
nonprofit organizations.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.320
These are organizations, which
have a purpose stated in their

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.630
charter other than
making money.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.160
And then, I want to talk about
government involvement in

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.840
for-profits, that for-profit
companies are not completely

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.110
clear of a social interest
as well.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.060
Then, I'm going to talk about
government finance of

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.720
projects, and then finally,
government social insurance.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.860
I'm hoping, that this lecture
will remind you of things that

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.980
you can do, because in all these
sectors there are things

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.430
that you can do.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.100
But one of the themes of this
course was, you should have a

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.260
purpose in life, and it should
not be making money, per se,

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.420
and think of finance as a tool
that you can use to help you

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.470
achieve this purpose.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.510
So, that's what I want
to talk about.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.090
Let me start, then,
with nonprofits.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.210
A nonprofit organization, it can
be corporation, that is an

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.040
organization set up to for a
charitable cause or a good

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:21.200
cause, and it has no owners, in
the sense that there's no

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.420
shareholders.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.360
The profits go back to the
organization for its purposes.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.670
So right now, you're
sitting --

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:30.695
as I mentioned before,
Yale is a nonprofit.

00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:32.650
It has no owners.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.990
It's a person, a legal
person in itself.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.320
But it has a board
of directors.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.880
In the United States in 2010,
there were 1.6 million

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.430
nonprofits.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.100
It's huge.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.070
The US is probably the country
that has the strongest

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.910
nonprofit sector.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.710
My number for the United Kingdom
may be out of date --

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.620
it was 120,000.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.220
It's part of the U.S. culture,
that nonprofits are big.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.800
It goes back to the founding
ideas of this country, that we

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.100
don't have the government
running everything.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.530
We do things on our own,
on our own initiative.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.150
Of course, it's not just the
U.S. There are nonprofits in

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.890
every country.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.880
But that's a lot
of nonprofits.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.950
And they recently accounted
for about 4% of

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.450
gross domestic product.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.910
So, OK, it's not huge, but
it's a very important

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:45.010
component of gross domestic
profit [correction: product].

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.930
I just want to start by thinking
about nonprofits, and

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.430
maybe put the idea in your head
of creating one at some

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:56.510
point in your life,
sooner or later.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.850
I thought, I'd start with some
examples, that are familiar to

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.100
me, of nonprofits.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.520
When you're thinking of some
activity or some idea you

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.890
have, you can set it up as
for-profit or nonprofit.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.980
And let's just think about,
why you would do that.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.560
So, I'll give you an example.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.760
Peter Tufano --

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:20.445
he's a professor at the Harvard
Business School --

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.250
set up a nonprofit on his own,
just as a professor.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.800
I know him.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.220
And he gave it an inspirational
name, Doorways

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.210
to Dreams. And it's about
personal finance and about

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.310
helping people do
things better in

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.940
their personal financing.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.720
So, one of his ideas --

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.170
and he raises money for his
foundation to promote it --

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.920
one of them is to have an
automatic check-off on the tax

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.810
form, so that, when you get a
tax refund, instead of getting

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.360
it in cash, it could go right
into U.S. savings bonds to

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.630
encourage people to save. This
is based on Behavioral

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.130
Finance, and the fact that a
lot of people, especially

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:14.460
lower income people, don't save.
A little nudge like that

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.870
would help them save.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.670
Another thing, this sounds like
a strange idea, but this

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.560
is the kind of thing he can
pursue on his own genius, as

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.780
long as he can raise money
to get them to do it.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.330
He has the idea that
a lot of people

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.390
like to play the lottery.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.340
Obviously, they do.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.670
And they just are steady
losers on this.

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.990
You know, on average,
they'll always lose.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.160
But given that people want
that, why don't we create

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.030
savings plans that pay out
randomly, like winning the

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.520
lottery, so that the government
doesn't have any

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.570
take in it, it just
encourages saving.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.070
That's a strange, original idea,
which you might find --

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.050
I don't know if I defended it
well enough to you -- you

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:59.080
might find it hard to convince
the government to do it, but

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.900
he can just do it.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.470
He doesn't have to talk
to the government.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.265
He talks to the individual
banks, and he's gotten some

00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:07.170
now to offer this plan.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:10.160
But what was striking to me is,
he said, when I go into

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.570
some company trying to raise
money for my projects, when I

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:18.090
tell them I'm nonprofit, it
changes the whole atmosphere,

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.950
because they know that I'm
not profiting from this.

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.180
And so, it opens up
opportunities.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.600
I'll give you a second
example.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.260
Dean Karlan here at Yale --

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.720
he came here as an assistant
professor.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.590
In 2002, he created
a charity called

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.430
Innovations for Poverty Action.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.810
So, this is Dean Karlan.

00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:47.400
Some of you may have
taken his course.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.020
Anyone took his course?

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:50.850
Some of you, yes.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:57.480
Actually, the doorbell rang at
my house here in New Haven,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.280
and a young woman was collecting
money for charity,

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.240
and it was his charity.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.490
I was shocked.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:09.320
He's actually sending people
door to door, at least as part

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.580
of his course.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.430
But since then, he's
developed --

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:19.010
again, when it's nonprofit and
it's aimed at alleviating

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.740
poverty, he can bring
in lots of money.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:28.610
So right now, last year, in
2010, the income of his

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.340
Innovations for Poverty Action
was $25 million.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.900
And he has a staff of 500 people
all over the world,

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.635
operating in a lot of
poor countries.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.770
That's a couple of examples
that are familiar to me,

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.960
because they were set up
by friends of mine.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.070
Another example.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.562
This is Bill Drayton.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:05.330
He set up something called
the Ashoka Foundation.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.190
Ashoka is a Hindi name for --

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:13.670
what is it -- it's a ruler
of India, who advocated

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.940
non-violence and philanthropy.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.370
And he went to Yale
Law School, as

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.050
well as Harvard College.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:22.240
So, sort of local here.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.860
But it's been a huge success,
and it encourages sort of

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:32.230
entrepreneurship, or social
entrepreneurs.

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.150
But he didn't stay on
as a professor.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.460
He taught at Stanford Law
School, but dropped out,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.600
because he wanted to pursue
his nonprofit.

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.450
I'm amazed that these two guys
can be both professors and

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.200
running big nonprofit shops
as well, but some

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.370
people can do that.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.720
My last example is Wendy Kopp.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.390
I like this example for your
age, because her story starts

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.360
with her senior essay.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.970
Do you know this story?

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:10.800
She was an undergraduate at
Princeton, graduated in 1989,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.250
and she had to write a --

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:16.970
maybe they call it
a senior thesis.

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:22.050
And so, she wrote something
about education, that she had

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:29.550
an idea, that often it's hard
for elementary education to

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.880
find people who are passionately
committed to

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.630
science or mathematics or other
fields, because these

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.060
people typically don't
want to devote

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.620
their lives to teaching.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.620
But they might devote a couple
years to teaching.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.040
And so, she thought, that it
would be a good idea to get

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.490
people, when they graduate from
college, to spend a year

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:55.200
or two in elementary education,
and that it would

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.710
be refreshing and good for the
educational system to get

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.850
enthusiastic young people, who
are really interested in the

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.870
disciplines.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.890
So, that was her
senior thesis.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:08.880
Now of course, you
can't get the

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.060
government to pay for that.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:10.680
Maybe you could.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.040
It might be hard, because, well,
the teachers union might

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.700
not like this, or
they might --

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.100
you know, it's sort of
a controversial idea.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.580
Some people would say, someone,
who's taken a course

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.290
in mathematics at Yale
University, is really not

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.540
qualified to teach young
children, because he or she

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.020
didn't take the educational
curriculum.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.900
And that's always going
to be controversial.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:38.400
But here, where we live in
a society that emphasizes

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.730
nonprofits, you don't have to
convince the government.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.010
You convince anybody
to finance this,

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.000
and you can do it.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.480
So, right out, she was 21 years
old, she graduated from

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:56.050
Princeton, she raised $2.5
million in her first year to

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.170
set up an organization, called
Teach for America.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:07.115
And the organization merely
recruited young people, who

00:14:07.115 --> 00:14:10.140
had just graduated college,
to go into teaching.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.030
So anyway, that's become her
life's work in the 20-plus

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:16.460
years since.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.740
She's heading what
she created.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.440
I like this story, because some
of you are writing senior

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.830
essays, right?

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.580
And you should consider it
as a model for some --

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.910
you might consider it as a model
for some great idea,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.750
that you might have, that you
could carry to the world.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:36.560
And one way to make it happen
is, if it's that kind of idea,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.710
you just set up a nonprofit
right there.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.610
Actually, I wanted to give
you some other examples.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:51.900
In New Haven, we have
two major hospitals.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.190
Where did they come from,
and why do we have them?

00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:01.970
Well, one of them is called
Yale New Haven.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.960
So, how did that get started?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:14.420
Well, it was started by a
nonprofit in 1826, called the

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.110
General Hospital Society
of Connecticut.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.760
Back then, there weren't many
hospitals, and so, someone set

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:24.900
up a nonprofit to set up a
hospital, and it was then the

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.190
only hospital in the state of
Connecticut, and so they

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.110
called it State Hospital.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.560
Later, as more hospitals
appeared, it didn't seem good

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.940
to call it State Hospital
anymore, so they changed the

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.110
name to New Haven Hospital.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.510
That was in 1884.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:50.000
And then, in 1913, they joined
with another nonprofit called

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.060
Yale University, and then later,
they changed their name

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.980
to Yale New Haven Hospital.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.890
But it's been a nonprofit
all the time.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.060
There are for-profit hospitals,
but this one was

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:05.660
always a nonprofit.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.550
The other hospital that we
have in New Haven is St.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:15.490
Raphael's, and that's newer.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:22.130
It was created in 1907, and the
story is, that a group of

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.910
physicians from the New Haven
area thought we needed a

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:30.625
second hospital, and they went
to Sisters of Charity

00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:30.835
[addition: Sisters of
Charity of Saint

00:16:30.835 --> 00:16:32.085
Elizabeth], which is a --

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:39.770
I don't know much about them,
it's a nunnery, I suppose --

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:45.460
and worked with them to create
a second hospital.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:50.650
And they chose the name Raphael,
after an archangel

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.810
recognized by many faiths, which
means God has healed.

00:16:58.099 --> 00:16:59.640
Interesting to think about
this hospital.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:03.980
So, whose idea was it, and
how did it happen?

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.210
Well, apparently the idea wasn't
from the Sisters of

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:09.790
Charity, it was from physicians

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.730
who were in New Haven.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.300
So, why did they go to the
Sisters of Charity?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.650
Why didn't they just set up
a for-profit hospital?

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.230
They could have bypassed
them completely.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.750
What's the link?

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.240
Well, I think that --

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.580
I don't know all of their
reasons, but I'm suspecting

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.100
the reasons are, that, when you
affiliate with a religious

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:35.400
organization, it gives a sense
of moral mission and social

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.030
purpose to the organization,
that it

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.750
wouldn't have otherwise.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.400
And it makes it very clear
that it's nonprofit and

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.720
encourages people to donate.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:50.330
So, I think that this
same idea has

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.960
dawned on many people.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.180
The people, who see a need for
a new hospital, are probably

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:07.640
not leaders of churches, but
they see a common interest in

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.685
pursuing hospitals.

00:18:10.685 --> 00:18:13.900
There have been many studies
about for-profit versus

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:19.120
nonprofit hospitals, and who
gives the better care.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.290
I think, that the studies are
generally inconclusive,

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.860
because even people, who are
operating for-profit

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.840
hospitals, have a social
mission as well.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.960
They have morals.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.810
It's not just churches.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:35.700
People outside of churches
have morals as well.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.520
And so, the actual distinction
between for-profit and

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.690
nonprofit is often somewhat
ambiguous.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.470
Let me move on to the second
point, that I said I was going

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.200
to talk about, which is
government involvement in

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.380
for-profits.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:19.620
So, governments exert control
over both nonprofits and

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:26.710
for-profits, and it's often a
difficult distinction between

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:30.830
a government activity and a
private activity, because of

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:38.150
the regulation that governments
impose over

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.085
companies and the taxes
they collect.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.390
Let me first make it clear, that
virtually every country

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:53.050
of the world has a substantial
corporate profits tax, and in

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:57.750
that sense governments are
co-owners of corporations,

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:58.750
private corporations.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:08.430
So, the corporate profits tax is
in effect a sort of partial

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.790
nationalization of
all the private

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.920
companies in the country.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:20.230
So, in the U.S., it currently
stands at 35% federal, and up

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:25.880
to 12% state and local,
depending on the state.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.910
So, it's as high as 47% --
it's basically half.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.100
So, you could say that the
U.S. government has

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:36.580
nationalized close to half
of the private sector.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.340
The government is collecting
from their profits, as if they

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.590
were a shareholder.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.590
This is state and local.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:50.080
But it's the same in other
countries, or similar.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:21:02.860
Canada, Ottawa collects 16.5%,
and the provinces, up to 16%.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:09.600
A little bit lower than the
U.S. Japan, the national

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:16.570
government has a 40.6%
profits tax.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:22.400
Brazil, 34%.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.890
You might think that under the
Lula government, the recent

00:21:24.890 --> 00:21:30.840
Lula government, they would be
more left wing, and would have

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.510
a higher profits tax,
but they don't.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:34.760
It's about the same.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:43.820
China is 25%.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:49.650
India is 33%.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.980
And I could go on and on.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:55.510
There's almost no country
that doesn't have it.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.440
So in that sense, everything
is part of the government.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.920
It' about the same all
over the world.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.950
And that's because --

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:03.620
I think there's a reason
for that --

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:12.720
because if you charge too high
a profits tax, then business

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.980
will leave your country.

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.690
Why do we charge
a profits tax?

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.450
Well, I think the corporate
profits tax is justified by

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.450
recognizing, that this thing
about for-profit or private

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:31.120
always has its limitations, and
anything that's private is

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.090
not completely isolated from
other interests or activities.

00:22:38.746 --> 00:22:44.045
I thought, it would be useful
to think of one example.

00:22:44.045 --> 00:22:48.340
There's a company
called TEPCO.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.500
You heard of this company?

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.700
I don't expect that you would.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.610
It's the fourth largest electric
power company in the

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.990
world, and it's traded in the
U.S. And you may own shares in

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.200
it and not know it, because
it's such a big

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.620
and important company.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.880
Or at least your parents, good
chance that they own shares in

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.010
it, because they probably own
some diversified portfolio in

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:18.090
their pension plan, or maybe
they even have it set up in a

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.060
trust for you already.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:23.170
So, don't judge TEPCO
too harshly.

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:23.510
All right.

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:27.130
But let me just tell you about
your investment in TEPCO.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.682
Guess what country it's in?

00:23:29.682 --> 00:23:30.490
STUDENT: Japan.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:32.370
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
You got it.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.620
So, somebody knows.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.440
Why would that matter
right now?

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.170
Big electric power
company in Japan.

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.520
That sounds like a
great investment?

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:42.840
Yes?

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.624
STUDENT: They own the power
plant has been affected by the

00:23:44.624 --> 00:23:45.305
earthquake in Japan.

00:23:45.305 --> 00:23:46.410
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
That's right.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:50.530
They own particularly the
Fukushima power plant.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:53.870
So, I checked out this morning,
what the share price

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.120
is going for in TEPCO.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:03.520
So it was, as of a month
or so ago, $25 a share.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.740
And it's down to $5 a share.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:07.440
It just went [SOUND EFFECT
INDICATING DOWNWARD MOVEMENT],

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.240
and you know exactly why.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.600
So, I looked at this further.

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:15.240
J.P. Morgan estimates now, that
claims against TEPCO will

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:20.700
be $25 billion, or a couple
of trillion yen.

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.640
But that's not all.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.260
They're also damaged, right?

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.070
Everything's in ruins.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:30.930
So, some people are predicting
that TEPCO will go bankrupt.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:36.180
So, they've created this whole
mess in Japan, and they're

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.160
just going to go bankrupt, and
we have limited liability.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.890
They're not going to
come after you.

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:46.160
The Japanese government could do
diligence and find out that

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:50.670
you own shares in TEPCO, and
TEPCO was negligent.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:51.660
They messed up.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:56.120
They didn't do their safety
procedures well enough.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.670
But they'll never
go after you.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.870
This is the whole idea
of limited liability.

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:06.290
So many people all over the
world are owning shares, and

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.260
we can't expect them to be
responsible for -- you can't

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.460
inspect the Fukushima plant,
even though you may be a

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.395
beneficiary of its profits.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.150
So, that's why they collect
the corporate profits --

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:24.580
Japan is collecting 40% percent
corporate profits tax,

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.280
and that can be used to offset
the damages that the Japanese

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.010
government now has to pay for.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:32.130
So, it all seems right.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.740
There's a plan here.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.970
So, you wonder, is TEPCO
private or not?

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.010
Well, it is private in the
sense that there are

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:43.310
shareholders and there are
profits, but it's regulated by

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.060
Japan, it's taxed by
Japan, and Japan

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.020
pays for their mistakes.

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.870
So, that's typical.

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:00.650
I'll give you another
example from this

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.845
country, General Motors.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:10.660
General Motors was the biggest
car company in the United

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:17.030
States, and then, it had a
little problem during the

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:21.940
financial crisis and had
to file for Chapter 11

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.190
bankruptcy.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.650
What am I referring to,
when I say Chapter 11?

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.380
The Bankruptcy Act has chapters,
and each chapter

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:37.660
says something different.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.660
The two most important chapters
for companies are

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:47.780
Chapter 7 and Chapter 11.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.570
What the bankruptcy law does is,
it creates a framework for

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:53.865
dealing with insolvency.

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:02.680
And the framework says, that a
company that is in trouble can

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.660
choose to apply for bankruptcy,
and there's

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.900
basically two important
ways to do that.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:14.590
Chapter 7 details one way you
can apply for bankruptcy, and

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.910
Chapter 11 details
another way.

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:22.170
Chapter 7 is liquidation.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:29.330
That means, that the company is
in such trouble, that we're

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.540
going to shut it down and
sell off all the assets.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.220
Chapter 11 is for a company
that is in trouble, but

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.650
there's something worth
salvaging in terms of

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:43.900
operating, continuing
the business.

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:49.560
So, GM chose Chapter
11 bankruptcy.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.850
They thought, obviously we've
been making cars for now close

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.220
to 100 years --

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:57.380
well, at least the companies
that went

00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.080
together to form GM --

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.830
and we have a big future.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:08.150
So, we can't pay our bills now,
but we should continue.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.290
So, they filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:15.610
But they were in such trouble,
that they couldn't get out of

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:19.590
it, so the U.S. government and
the Canadian government

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:24.130
invested in GM.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:29.930
What happened was,
General Motors --

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.120
they changed the name in
the most subtle way.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.100
The official name of the company
was General Motors

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.350
Corporation.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.790
When they filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy, the shareholders

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.950
were wiped out --

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.290
nobody got executed --

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:49.430
you lost all your money.

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.720
And so, if you find in your
attic some nice, beautiful

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.470
share certificates for General
Motors Corporation, you can

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.700
just use them as wallpaper
or whatever.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.110
They're worthless.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:03.850
But if it's different, if it
says General Motors Company,

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.490
because that refers
to the new GM --

00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:08.260
they wanted to change the name,
but they didn't really

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:09.220
want to change the name.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.030
They had to change the name,
so that people wouldn't

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.610
confuse the two.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:13.150
So, what happened?

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:15.070
How did we get a new GM?

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:19.130
Well, the new GM was owned
by the U.S. government.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.930
It was equal to --

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.200
where is it, I had it here --

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:41.590
60.8% U.S., Canada owned 12%.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:50.700
The UAW, United Auto
Workers, got 17.5%.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:54.460
Why did the union, by the
way, get 17% of GM?

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.790
Well, I don't know the whole
story, but I'm sure it has

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.490
something to do with
GM's obligations.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.940
Maybe they failed
on something, I

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.270
don't know the details.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.730
But it seemed, in the bankruptcy
proceedings, that

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.200
the implicit debts, that the
company owed to their workers,

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.960
would be represented by a
share in the company.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:23.050
And then, the rest went to the
bondholders, people, who own

00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:27.480
debt, not equity, who own debt
in GM, got the remaining

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.850
share, and they also got
warrants, which are options to

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.540
buy more shares, which will
dilute down the U.S. and

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.740
Canada and UAW shares.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.490
So, that's the settlement.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:43.630
The result of the settlement
was, that it was a government

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.150
owned organization.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:50.730
Now, they've just done an IPO,
so they're reversing this

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:51.660
ownership structure.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.260
But the point is, that companies
that look private

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.700
may end up government

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.880
eventually, one time or another.

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:16.150
So, companies have to kind of
think of themselves as, even

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.430
in an arch-capitalist country
like the United States, as

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:23.410
partly government
organizations.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.960
By the way, there's something
else called personal

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.630
bankruptcy.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:37.420
And personal bankruptcy is
another involvement of the

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.920
government in risk management.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.650
You as an individual can declare
bankruptcy, and you

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:50.540
can choose these chapters or
you can do -- there's other

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.280
provisions as well.

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.070
But you can use Chapter 7 to
wipe out all of your debts.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:02.220
The new bankruptcy law that
Congress passed a few years

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.540
ago tends to limit your
ability to do that.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.200
But within limits, the same
government is kind of a

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:17.470
shareholder, just as
individuals are.

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:26.045
I mean, a shareholder in
individuals' lifetime incomes.

00:32:26.045 --> 00:32:30.860
I guess, what I'm saying is,
that the whole idea of public

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.180
versus private is a
complicated one.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.400
And what seems public
at one time will

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.710
seem private at another.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.910
The behavior of nonprofits is
not strikingly different than

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.450
the behavior of for-profits.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:33:02.090
So, I found a statistic, that
42% of nonprofits pay bonuses

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.970
to their executives.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:08.340
That is, they're using the same
kind of incentive plans

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.170
that private corporations do.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.340
Why would they do that?

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.870
Well, they do that, because they
have to hire people, and

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:19.530
people in the for-profit sector
are getting bonuses.

00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:22.600
So, how do you hire someone, and
get someone good, unless

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.000
you pay the bonus as well?

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:32.650
The government faces a big
problem, in that the public is

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:35.590
very sensitive to paying high
salaries to government

00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.510
employees, because they
think it's unfair.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.900
Why should some government
bureaucrat be

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.670
paid more than I get?

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:47.739
As a result, they have trouble
hiring good people.

00:33:47.739 --> 00:33:49.860
But in the nonprofit sector --

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.550
the nonprofit sector is
not constrained --

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.550
well, they have some
constraints over --

00:33:55.550 --> 00:34:00.449
they're regulated to prevent
them from stealing the money.

00:34:00.449 --> 00:34:04.520
I think, part of the idea
of having nonprofits --

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.409
this is a general point -- is,
that the government is kind of

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.620
confined to politically correct,
conventional wisdom

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.540
type activities.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.260
And they can do things that
are just generally

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:25.600
acknowledged by the average
person as a good thing, but

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:30.070
they can't do something
innovative as well or

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:33.260
controversial as well.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:38.620
And I think, that it's often in
those controversial things,

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.375
that some of our biggest
progress is made.

00:34:42.375 --> 00:34:46.600
So, I gave the example of
Charles Darwin and his

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:55.950
professor, who advocated his
voyage around the world.

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.290
Professor --

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.960
I'm trying to see what
his name was --

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.190
Henslow, I think it was,
was actually a --

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:06.480
John Stevens Henslow, a botanist
but also a advocate

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.540
of natural theology.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.690
And he sent Darwin out on this
voyage, because he thought,

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:16.670
that studying nature enabled
you to discover God.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:20.310
Little did he know, Darwin would
end up an atheist after

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.240
his voyage.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.595
But it's this kind of weird
stuff that gets financed.

00:35:25.595 --> 00:35:28.500
Or Wendy Kopp, I gave as another
example, whose ideas

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.710
were too controversial.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.570
I mean, the idea of sending
someone out, who didn't have

00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:39.248
an education diploma to teach,
too controversial.

00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:55.470
So, I think that there is maybe
a growing recognition of

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.270
the importance of having
people who are --

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.020
well, there's a term --
social entrepreneurs.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:08.250
I don't know, whether they're
for-profit or nonprofit, but

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:15.920
they're people, who do things
out of a sense of mission,

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:24.240
beyond making money, but
helping the world.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.890
And you see this reported in
newspapers and magazines, that

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:32.070
the 21st century seems to be a
century, where there's more

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.980
and more of this
kind of thing.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:39.130
And it's in substantial measure,
I think, nonprofit.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:50.920
Now, I wanted to move to the
third thing, which I said is

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.810
municipal, or state
and local finance.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:37:00.240
It's a big topic, but an awful
lot of what gets done in this

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.100
country is done by state
and local governments.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.010
It's something on the order --

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.345
it's bigger than the
federal government.

00:37:08.345 --> 00:37:11.010
The state and local governments
spend about twice

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.500
as much money as the U.S.
federal government.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.600
They run all the public schools,
fire departments,

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.950
police departments,
most of the parks.

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:20.480
What else?

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.590
I mean, a lot of things are
being run by state and local

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.840
governments.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:37.570
I think, another thing that one
could do to make things

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.100
happen in the world --

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:44.170
I mentioned the possibility
of setting up a nonprofit.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.160
You can make things happen by
doing that, but you can also

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:50.310
make things happen by
approaching a local

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:57.830
government, and saying to them,
I think that you would

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:04.270
do well to build a hospital, or
build a bridge, or build a

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:12.160
new school, or even kind of
business oriented things, that

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.590
would be projects that the
government can undertake.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:20.080
And then, they can finance
it as a state and local

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.760
government.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.560
Now one thing, in the United
States, every state in the

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:38.030
United States has a ''balanced
budget rule.'' That is, they

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:45.130
have to tax people for all of
the expenditures they make.

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.260
They are not allowed
to go into debt.

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:54.460
But we have to be careful about
what the balanced budget

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.320
rules in their constitution say,
because, obviously, there

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.880
is municipal debt.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.030
Governments do borrow money.

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:06.640
State and local governments
in the United States have

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.180
typically --

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.220
it differs across
states -- they

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.130
typically have two budgets.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:16.120
They have an operating budget
and a capital budget.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:22.740
The operating budget is what has
to be balanced, according

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.620
to their constitutions.

00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:29.390
The operating budget involves a
list of all the expenditures

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:34.480
they made for operations,
and the taxes.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:37.050
And they cannot --

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.760
it differs by state on how it's
worded -- but they cannot

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.190
plan to run a deficit
in some states.

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:45.970
Or if they do run a deficit on
the operating budget, they

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.030
have to correct it soon
and have a plan for

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:50.280
correcting it soon.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.990
But the capital budget
is different.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:58.820
If a city builds a new school,
for example, that's not an

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.750
operating expense.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.190
It's a capital expense.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.820
So, it's building something
that will last through the

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:11.060
ages, and so it goes on the
capital budget, and not on the

00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:12.630
operating budget.

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.940
And all the states allow this.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:17.620
They can raise money by
borrowing, and they

00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:19.060
routinely do that.

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.630
So, that means they get into
debt, and then they have a

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:32.030
potential for going
bankrupt as well.

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.740
So, this is the way it works.

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:43.250
Imagine that you're setting
up a new town, and

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.200
it's small right now.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.610
Little town, but we know, that
people are coming this way,

00:40:48.610 --> 00:40:51.910
and it's going to be a big
town in 20, 30 years.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.820
So, what do we do?

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.870
Well, you lay out the streets,
and you plan for a

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:56.820
big town right now.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.990
You better plan for it or
it'll get congested.

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:01.020
So, better lay out wide
enough streets.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:02.600
That's easy to do.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:08.100
But you want to build the
streets, before the people

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.750
come, have the layout,
and have lots,

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:11.870
and have it all planned.

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.800
And how about a sewage system?

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.870
The people aren't here yet.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:23.810
So, you consult a sewage
engineer, and the engineer

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:26.020
tells you, you know, if you're
going to build a sewage

00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.150
system, you should do
it all at once.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:31.390
It's going to be too expensive
to do it year after year, just

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:32.560
adding a little bit,
a little bit.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:34.420
You've got to have a plan,
have an idea, where

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:35.760
this city is going.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.520
Let's build it for a city
of 20,000 people.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.280
We can do it now, but it will
cost you $100 million.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.550
So, what do you do?

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.260
You might say, we can't
pay for that.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.350
There's only 30 people
living in this town.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.210
How do we come up with
$100 million?

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.340
Obviously, you borrow.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.400
You put it on the
capital budget.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:59.500
And that is fair and just,
because then, as people come

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:06.590
to the city, they will
then pay taxes and

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:07.830
pay back the debt.

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.020
This is the way it works,
and it's the

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:10.000
way it's always worked.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.420
Now, you could say, well, no,
it shouldn't be this way.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:16.220
Why don't we have all of the
individual people pay for

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.950
their own sewers, and add to the
sewer system as they build

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:19.940
their houses.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.710
It's not going to work.

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:22.490
That would be crazy.

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:28.840
You've got to build the whole
system in advance, and so

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.550
that's what city governments
do routinely.

00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:42.170
And they go deeply into debt as
a result of having created

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:48.940
all of these capital
investments, and having the

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.460
debt against them.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.260
So, your city that has 20
people has borrowed $100

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:55.180
million, and it's going
to be a city of

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.840
20,000 people, you think.

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.680
What if it doesn't work?

00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.470
What if they don't come?

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:02.080
Your plan was wrong.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.080
Then, the city is at risk of
going bankrupt, right?

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:11.410
So, there's another whole
chapter for municipal

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:17.710
bankruptcy, Chapter 9 of
the Bankruptcy Code.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:21.250
And Chapter 9 is for
city government.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.810
There's a problem, that cities
going bankrupt are different,

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.160
because they don't have
any shareholders.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:32.130
They do have an ability
to tax people.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.950
There's a question of how much
you should tax people in a

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:36.760
bankrupt city.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.390
If you get tax them too much,
they'll just all leave. So,

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:41.640
it's a subtle problem.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:49.860
But fortunately, there haven't
been, and I'm not sure we

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.960
really understand why, there
have not been many municipal

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:57.420
bankruptcies at all.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:01.800
Between 1975 --

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.370
OK, I'm sorry.

00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:05.230
Do I have data?

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:07.610
I thought I had data on numbers
of bankruptcy --

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.310
There are some famous municipal
bankruptcies.

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:15.640
New York City went bankrupt,
or it was about to declare

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:20.280
bankruptcy in the 1970s, but
it was saved by bailouts.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.370
Maybe, that's the reason
why we don't.

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:26.670
Basically, when New York City
said, that it couldn't pay its

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:31.160
debts, the State of New York
came by with a bailout.

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.800
And then also, although
reluctantly and with a lag,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.930
the U.S. federal government
came in with a bailout.

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:48.270
So, New York never declared
bankruptcy.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:51.140
A lot of cities will have what's
called a ''rainy day

00:44:51.140 --> 00:45:01.220
fund.'' So, they will accumulate
assets to help them

00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.290
over troubled times.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:10.490
So, you can collect somewhat
higher taxes, and then, you

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:14.650
have an endowment, the city has
an endowment, which can

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:18.520
help tide them over through
difficult times.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:24.280
But recently, most
of the rainy day

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.060
funds have been exhausted.

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:33.320
The state and local governments
saved for a rainy

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.040
day, and this was a rainy day,
this financial crisis.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:41.170
And so, most state and local
governments are in trouble

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:44.460
right now, because of the
recession causing their tax

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:48.570
revenues to decline, and there's
increasing worry about

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.240
municipal bankruptcies.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.610
So, I said that there haven't
been many historically, but

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:57.830
people are edgy now thinking,
that there could be some now

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.280
because of the financial
crisis.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:06.460
And so, the yields on municipal
bonds have gone up.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.662
Municipal bonds are tax-free
in the United States.

00:46:09.662 --> 00:46:09.734
[clarification: Predominantly,
municipal bonds are tax-free

00:46:09.734 --> 00:46:09.878
in the U.S., but there are a few
exceptions, as outlined in

00:46:09.878 --> 00:46:11.128
the Fabozzi et al. textbook.]

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:21.850
So, if the City of New Haven
issues debt, and you buy that

00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:25.510
debt, you are not subject to
federal income tax on the

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.260
interest that you earn.

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.730
That's because in the
constitution it says, that

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:33.970
there's a separation between
federal and state.

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:37.330
The federal cannot tax the
state, so they don't tax your

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:38.520
municipal bond.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:45.650
There's a subsidy towards
municipal bonds implicit in

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:46.900
the tax law.

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:56.200
By the way, let me just
mention the fact, that

00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:01.690
municipal bonds issued by local
governments are not

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:06.830
subject to taxes, extends, as
well, to Yale University.

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:10.080
So, Yale University issues
bonds, that are in the same

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:14.380
category as municipal bonds,
and they're not taxed.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.650
So, there's an advantage, a tax
advantage, and especially

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:21.430
higher-income investors like to
invest in municipal bonds,

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.370
because it matters more for
higher income investors,

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:28.660
because the tax rate hits them
more, so there's an advantage.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:33.380
So, Yale issues municipal
bonds, and Yale is an

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:35.920
important debtor.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:39.000
Now, you might wonder
about that.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.640
So, let's talk about Yale as
a municipal bond issuer.

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:52.565
Yale has an endowment of $16
billion as of last year

00:47:52.565 --> 00:47:54.380
[addition: 2010],

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:58.110
and it has a debt
of $2.5 billion.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:07.390
So, that leaves Yale with
only $13.5 billion in

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.110
assets after debt.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:14.260
So, you might say, why does
Yale borrow money?

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:14.550
Right?

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:17.550
I mean, it's got $16 billion
in investing.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.290
Why is it borrowing?

00:48:19.290 --> 00:48:22.060
Well, there are many reasons,
I suppose, but the immediate

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.350
and obvious reason that comes to
mind is, that Yale borrows

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:30.500
money, because it can borrow
at a tax-subsidized rate.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:37.110
If Yale's debt is not subject
to income tax, then that

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:41.270
means, it can borrow at a lower
rate, and Yale would be

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.810
inclined --

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:47.830
or any nonprofit that can issue
non-taxable debt --

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:53.147
would like to do that, in order
to invest in assets that

00:48:53.147 --> 00:48:55.100
are taxable.

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.750
Yale doesn't pay any taxes
on either of them.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.280
So you see, what I'm saying?

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.640
Municipal debt has a lower yield
in the market, because

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.520
everybody knows, it's not
subject to income taxes, so it

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.090
has a low yield.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:12.720
So, Yale could issue that debt,
and use the money to

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.770
invest in high yielding things
that are taxable, and it's not

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:18.120
going to pay taxes
on them, either.

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:20.760
So, there's an arbitrage game
that Yale could play, or any

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:26.550
nonprofits could play, but it
does not, because it's not

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:33.210
allowed to, unless it's using
the proceeds of the debt for

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:34.460
appropriate causes.

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.390
You have to understand, this is
why Yale University has a

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:45.140
substantial debt, and why the
City of New Haven has a

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.830
substantial debt.

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:52.310
It all makes sense in some
basic finance framework.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:02.100
But there's a lot of concern
about indebtedness right now,

00:50:02.100 --> 00:50:06.420
because, with the financial
crisis, the U.S. and Europe

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.680
and many other countries
are suffering debt

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.140
crises right now.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.410
So, it's renewing calls for a
balanced budget amendment.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.560
The U.S. government does not
have a balanced budget

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.940
amendment, like the state
governments do.

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.390
And in fact, the
U.S. government

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:22.980
has only one budget.

00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.780
It does not have a
capital budget.

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.040
So in some sense, the state
governments are more

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.070
sophisticated than the federal
government in the U.S., in

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:35.040
that they have the distinction
between

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.495
operating and capital budgets.

00:50:40.170 --> 00:50:42.580
I guess the reason,
why the U.S. --

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.190
the U.S. government has
considered adopting a capital

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:47.610
budget, but it has
never done so.

00:50:47.610 --> 00:50:51.000
I think, maybe, it's because the
U.S. government has fewer

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:59.150
investments, like schools or
parks or water facilities,

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:00.840
sewage facilities.

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.430
It doesn't do that kind of
thing, so it doesn't have as

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:07.500
many clearly capital projects.

00:51:10.798 --> 00:51:13.365
It has a much bigger debt
than the state and local

00:51:13.365 --> 00:51:14.615
governments.

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:28.290
I guess, then, I'll move to my
last topic today, which is

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:34.220
about government social
insurance.

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:41.840
And this is along the same
theme, I'm talking today about

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.160
the roles of --

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.660
finance is about risk
management, and it's about

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:50.110
incentivization.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:58.300
And some of the basic rules
are classified under the

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.780
rubric of social insurance,
which is offered by the

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:04.030
government.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:09.900
This is a huge topic.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:21.710
Social insurance refers to
insurance, that is not

00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:29.910
available by a private insurance
company, but that is

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.730
offered generally by
governments, and let me just

00:52:32.730 --> 00:52:34.800
give some examples.

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:36.640
I put it first, progressive
taxes.

00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:45.980
Progressive taxes are income
taxes that tax higher income

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:51.500
people at a lower rate
[correction: at a higher rate].

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:59.110
And progressive taxes have
increasingly, in recent years,

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:03.480
adopted something analogous to
the earned income tax credit,

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.370
the EITC --

00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:08.290
that's the U.S. name for it, but
it's now in many countries

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:09.430
around the world --

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:15.320
that provides negative taxes for
the lowest income people.

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.780
So, the effect of progressive
taxes with earned income tax

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:26.520
credit is to insulate
people somewhat from

00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.800
shocks to their income.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:34.010
They call it an earned income
tax credit, by the way,

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.690
because you have to have earned

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:37.830
income to get the credit.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:40.130
You can't be just unemployed.

00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:43.300
But if you are working and
earning very little,

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:47.390
especially if you have a
family, then you have a

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:52.180
negative income tax rate, so
that the government augments

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:56.400
your low income with
a negative tax.

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.250
I think this is very
important, and

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:05.480
it actually is effective.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.090
Otherwise, the world
would be much more

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:11.460
unequal than it is now.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.710
I would add, by the way, public
services, which are

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:19.440
offered out of taxes,
to everyone in a

00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:22.890
country, notably education.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:28.960
School systems are generally
free and that is, again,

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.890
something that--

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:34.520
I consider these a form of
insurance, because they

00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:38.340
benefit people, who are
unsuccessful in earning money.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:42.030
So, it's like an insurance
program against possible

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:47.370
failure in achieving status
in the economic system.

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:53.180
So, we also have --

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.570
I'll go up here --

00:54:54.570 --> 00:54:57.005
three, Social Security.

00:55:00.252 --> 00:55:04.380
And I'm using U.S. terms, but
these are terms that --

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:09.550
these things happen
in virtually

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:11.120
all advanced countries.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.840
In the U.S., we call it OASDI.

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:22.430
That stands for Old
Age, Survivors,

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:26.450
and Disability Insurance.

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:37.410
Old age insurance is pensions,
and that's the biggest part of

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:41.890
the social security system
in the United States.

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:42.860
It's insuring --

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:44.490
well, it's really something you
know is going to happen --

00:55:44.490 --> 00:55:46.350
you're going to get
old someday,

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:50.100
but we call it insurance.

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:53.920
Survivors insurance
is life insurance.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.720
I mean, it benefits you.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.260
You're getting too old for this
now, but if your parents

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:02.390
die when you're young,
the U.S. government

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:05.030
will give you an income.

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:07.790
You're an orphan, you have
nothing, your parents died,

00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:12.710
and left you nothing, you
get survivors insurance.

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:14.700
You didn't know you
had this, right?

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:18.560
It's not publicized a lot, but
it's part of what protects

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.380
people, and it's offered
by the government.

00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.570
And then thirdly, disability
insurance --

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:27.780
again, offered by the
government --

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:33.340
is against you breaking your
neck and becoming paralyzed.

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.960
Or anything like that,
that makes it

00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.560
impossible for you to work.

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:41.380
The U.S. government will give
you an income for life.

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:43.610
So, if you are permanently
paralyzed, you get

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:45.910
an income for life.

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:47.980
All three of these
are purchasable

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:49.320
in the private sector.

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:51.300
You can buy a pension.

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:54.385
You can buy survivors insurance
-- they don't call

00:56:54.385 --> 00:56:57.550
it that, they call it
life insurance.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:01.800
Just turning it around
to a different name.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.270
The sellers of life insurance
don't want to remind you, that

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.570
you already have a life
insurance policy from the

00:57:06.570 --> 00:57:09.350
government, because you
might say, well,

00:57:09.350 --> 00:57:10.470
I got enough already.

00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:14.310
So, they give it a different
name and they probably won't

00:57:14.310 --> 00:57:16.200
remind you that you have it.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.755
And then, you can buy disability
insurance.

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.980
But part of the problem with
private offering of these

00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:24.830
insurances --

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:27.890
disability insurance, if it's
offered privately, suffers a

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:31.220
selection bias problem, that
some people, who realize that

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:35.100
they are going to have a
disability, will buy the

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.660
insurance right away.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.910
And then, we have health
insurance.

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:46.150
And I don't want to use the
U.S. an example for this,

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:48.600
because we're kind
of a laggard on

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:50.250
most of these things.

00:57:50.250 --> 00:57:55.110
But we had a new health bill
that passed under Obama last

00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:59.640
year, and it's starting to gear
up, but the U.S. is not

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:03.530
the world leader in
health insurance.

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:05.880
It has currently about
40 million people

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:09.220
with no health insurance.

00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.565
And then, there's workers
compensation.

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:23.570
These are the main aspects of
social insurance today.

00:58:23.570 --> 00:58:27.320
Workers compensation is an older
form of health insurance

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:30.010
that preceded health insurance,
at least in the

00:58:30.010 --> 00:58:31.800
United States.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:38.660
And it compensated workers for
accidents that occurred at

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:41.320
work, and, in the U.S.,
this came in in

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:45.100
the progressive era.

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:47.770
But all these are risk
management devices that are

00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:49.020
offered by governments.

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:57.730
Now, these social insurance
schemes are relatively recent

00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:03.190
innovations, and, in fact,
I think, that the

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.756
first national --

00:59:03.756 --> 00:59:05.170
I know that --

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:11.760
the first national social
insurance programs began in

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:18.150
Germany in the late
19th century.

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:23.290
So, another theme of this course
has been, that the

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:29.230
ability to do things like this
requires a developed society

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:32.070
with a certain technology,
with an information

00:59:32.070 --> 00:59:36.060
technology, with a bureaucratic
technology.

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.980
And they haven't been around
for that long.

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:44.430
If you go back in history 200,
300 or more years, there

00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:48.110
wasn't social insurance
anywhere.

00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:51.420
Maybe there was, in some
isolated community, but

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:57.290
basically it didn't exist. And
so, the history of social

00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:06.150
insurance is interesting,
and I think, it reflects

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:08.040
information technology growth.

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:16.100
The country that is most
remarkable for having invented

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:22.270
social insurance is Germany
under Otto von

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:27.020
Bismarck in the 1880s.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:32.180
And I think, that it happened
there first because of the

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.515
information technology.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.840
It's an interesting
story that --

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.950
there were various attempts to
start social insurance in

01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:53.310
different parts of the
world, that were

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.130
half-hearted and failed.

01:00:55.130 --> 01:01:00.570
In the United Kingdom in the
late 1700s, there was a town

01:01:00.570 --> 01:01:05.530
called Speenhamland, a tiny town
in the U.K., that decided

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:08.210
they would start social
insurance.

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:11.100
They decided, that there was a
living wage that anyone ought

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.830
to be able to earn, and anyone,
who earned less than

01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:17.000
that, would have the difference
paid by the town.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.080
So, it's called the Speenhamland
Law, and that

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.120
town offered to pay
the difference.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.250
The problem was,
it didn't work.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:32.290
Too many people reported, that
they were getting less income

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:38.660
than the living income that
they defined, and the town

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:40.240
discovered it was being
ripped off.

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:46.990
The problem was, they couldn't
identify what a person's

01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:49.500
income really was, accurately.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.645
They couldn't tell, whether
someone was goofing off or

01:01:51.645 --> 01:01:54.560
not, and so, they dropped it.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.510
I think, there are other
examples of failed experiments

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:14.740
like this, but it took hold
first in Germany in the 1880s,

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:24.740
and they got accident insurance,
health insurance,

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:32.630
and old age insurance, or
retirement, for everyone in

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:38.570
Germany in the 1880s, and it
was considered a fiasco by

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:40.690
other countries of the world.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:44.390
When Germany announced these
plans to create social

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:49.010
insurance, the London Times
wrote an article saying, this

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:51.330
whole thing will fall
through and fail.

01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:55.520
The government is going to run
all of these insurance

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.470
policies for something like, I
think, there were 11 million

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:05.690
workers in Germany at the time,
and in London they said,

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:06.850
you've got to be kidding.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:10.950
No government in the world
has ever managed to run

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:12.210
something like this.

01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:16.190
Let's think particularly about
retirement insurance.

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:21.180
The German government set up a
plan, whereby people would

01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:25.740
contribute over their working
lives to a social security

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:31.570
system, and the system would
then years later, 30, 40 years

01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:35.070
later, keep a tab, about how
much they contributed, and

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:38.280
then pay them a pension for
the rest of their lives.

01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:42.380
So, the Times wondered
aloud, are they going

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.840
to mess this up?

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:45.790
They've got to keep records
for 40 years.

01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:49.130
They were talking about the
government keeping records,

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:53.450
and they thought, nobody can
really manage to do this, and

01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:57.280
that it will collapse
in ruins.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.040
But it didn't.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:05.130
The Germans managed to do this
in the 1880s for the first

01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:10.320
time, and actually it was
an idea that was copied

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.490
all over the world.

01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:16.940
So, why is it that Germany was
able to do something like this

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:20.830
in the 1880s, when it was not
doable anywhere else?

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:23.320
It had never been done
until that time.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.090
I think this has to do
ultimately with technology.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:34.040
Technology, particularly
information technology, was

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.190
advancing rapidly in
the 19th century.

01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:42.840
Not as rapidly as in the 20th,
but rapidly advancing.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:53.170
So, what happened in Europe
that made it possible to

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:54.965
institute these radical
new ideas?

01:04:58.100 --> 01:05:01.450
I just give a list
of some things.

01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:03.550
Paper.

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:05.050
This is information
technology, but

01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:06.200
you don't think --

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.050
in the 18th century, paper,
ordinary paper it was very

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:15.360
expensive, because it was made
from cloth in those days --

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.680
they didn't know how to make
paper from wood, and it had to

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.140
be hand-made.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:27.590
As a result, if you bought a
newspaper in, say, 1790, it

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.170
would be just one page, and
it would be printed on the

01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:33.025
smallest print, because it
was just so expensive.

01:05:33.025 --> 01:05:35.980
It would cost you like
$20 in today's

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.790
prices to buy one newspaper.

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:42.130
Then, they invented the paper
machine that made it

01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:45.550
mechanically, and they made it
out of wood pulp, and suddenly

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.190
the cost of paper went down.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.980
By the way, I found an old
textbook from Yale

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:55.220
University from 1837.

01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:57.420
It's still sitting there on
the shelf in the library.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.250
I was looking --

01:05:59.250 --> 01:06:04.010
we were using a Principles of
Economics textbook for all

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.370
Yale students, they all had
to take the same course.

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:09.080
And it is a nice little book,
but it was so small --

01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.190
I picked it up --

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:12.690
it was like that big.

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:14.400
You could put in your pocket.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.110
I think it's, because books were
just expensive, so the

01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:17.670
students --

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:20.940
you have these huge textbooks
now, that weigh so much they

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:24.080
probably challenge
your back --

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.500
back then, you could
carry your books.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.940
There was a fundamental economic
difference, and so,

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.840
paper was one of the things.

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.460
And you never got a receipt
for anything,

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:34.110
when you bought something.

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:35.600
You go to the store and
buy something, you

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:37.180
think you get a receipt?

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:39.960
Absolutely not, because it's
too -- well, they wouldn't

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.460
know why, but that's the
ultimate reason --

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:44.550
too expensive.

01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:46.240
And so, they invented paper.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.530
Two, carbon paper.

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:53.010
Do you people even know
what this is?

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:55.860
Anyone here heard
of carbon paper?

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.070
Maybe, I don't know.

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:00.050
It used to be, that, when you
wanted to make a copy of

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.720
something, you didn't have
any copying machines.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.590
You would buy this special
paper, which was --

01:07:06.590 --> 01:07:08.770
do you know what -- do I have
to explain this to you?

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:10.570
You know what carbon paper is?

01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:12.870
You put it between two sheets of
paper, and you write on the

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:15.300
upper one, and it comes through
on the lower one.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.170
This was never invented until
the 19th century.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.900
Nobody had carbon paper.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.620
You couldn't make copies
of anything.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.930
There was no way
to make a copy.

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:25.440
They hadn't invented
photography, yet.

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:30.070
They had no way to
make a copy.

01:07:30.070 --> 01:07:31.940
You had to just hand-copy
everything.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:38.520
The first copying machine --

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:40.510
maybe I mentioned that -- didn't
come until the 20th

01:07:40.510 --> 01:07:44.340
century, and they were
photographic.

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.765
And the typewriter.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.515
That was invented
in the 1870s.

01:07:50.515 --> 01:07:53.470
Now, it may seem like a small
thing, but it was a very

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:58.649
important thing, because you
could make accurate documents,

01:07:58.649 --> 01:08:01.529
and they were not subject to
misinterpretation because of

01:08:01.529 --> 01:08:02.500
sloppy handwriting --

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:07.109
and I'm doing sloppy handwriting
here for you, but

01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:10.560
I'm using the old
technology here.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.800
But the typewriter.

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.270
And you could also
make many copies.

01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:17.470
You could make six copies at
once with carbon paper.

01:08:17.470 --> 01:08:18.710
And they're all exactly
the same.

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:22.130
You can file each one in a
different filing cabinet.

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:29.189
Four, standardized forms. These
were forms that had

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.930
fill-in-the-blank with
a typewriter.

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:33.180
They had filing cabinets.

01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.915
And finally, bureaucracy
developed.

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:41.330
They had management school.

01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:44.920
Particularly in Germany, it was
famous for its management

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.974
schools and its business
schools.

01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:51.980
Oh, I should add, also,
postal service.

01:08:55.439 --> 01:09:01.240
If you wanted to mail a letter
in 1790, you'd have trouble,

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:02.779
and it would cost you a lot.

01:09:02.779 --> 01:09:07.390
Most people in 1790 got maybe
one letter a year, or two

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:08.490
letters a year.

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:09.800
That was it.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.529
But in the 19th century, they
started setting up post

01:09:13.529 --> 01:09:15.770
offices all over the world,
and the Germans were

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:19.159
particularly good at this kind
of bureaucratic thing.

01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:22.420
So, there were post offices in
every town, and the social

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:25.550
security system operated through
the post offices.

01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:28.150
Because once you have post
offices in every town, you

01:09:28.150 --> 01:09:32.270
would go to make your payments
on social security at the post

01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:34.900
office, and they would give you
stamps, and you'd paste

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:41.770
them on a card, and that's
how you would show

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:44.230
that you had paid.

01:09:44.230 --> 01:09:48.590
So, I think that this kind of
information technology brought

01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:51.950
us the social security system.

01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:56.810
And the kinds of advances in
information technology that

01:09:56.810 --> 01:10:01.060
we've seen more recently will
eventually lead to changes in

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:01.620
the system.

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:12.930
Ultimately, technology drives
finance, and the system

01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:14.910
responds to changes
in technology.

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:20.100
All right.

01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:22.730
So, I just wanted
to just wrap up.

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:29.800
I talked today about a broader
social purpose that's served

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:35.900
by our finance, and it takes
place in terms of for-profit

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.820
as well as nonprofit.

01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.670
But the distinction between
for-profit and nonprofit is a

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:42.580
subtle one.

01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:47.060
I think, what happens is, people
think of a purpose of

01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.070
something they want to achieve,
and then they think,

01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:55.080
how can I use our financial
technology to incentivize

01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:00.070
people to subscribe capital to
this project or to give their

01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:02.650
personal attention
to this project?

01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:08.330
And then, our system of finance
has a lot of things, a

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:16.170
lot of devices, that can allow
the providence of capital, and

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:19.080
that will incentivize people.

01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:31.000
I think, another theme of this
course has been Behavioral

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.310
Finance that I think --

01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:38.980
people are psychological, they
have emotions, and they react

01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.450
in complicated ways.

01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:45.030
One of the oldest themes of
economics is, that people

01:11:45.030 --> 01:11:51.550
respond to incentives, but they
respond to pleas to their

01:11:51.550 --> 01:11:55.450
morality as well, or their
ideals as well.

01:11:55.450 --> 01:11:58.220
When we talk about the nonprofit
sector, it seems

01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:03.300
that the financial arrangements
reflect a

01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:09.260
combination of selfish
money-oriented incentives and

01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:10.510
more social-purpose-incentives.

01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:14.490
And the same thing goes with
government activities.

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:21.470
Anyway, I guess, I have one more
lecture, and I'm going to

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:28.020
talk next time more broadly
about, what finance offers us,

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:32.590
and how it allows us to achieve
social purposes.

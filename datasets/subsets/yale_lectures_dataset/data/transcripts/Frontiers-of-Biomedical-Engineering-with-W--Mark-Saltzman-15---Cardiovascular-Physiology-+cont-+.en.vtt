00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.132
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, today we're going to

00:00:15.132 --> 00:00:16.640
continue to talk about cardiac
physiology.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.830
In particular,
the electrophysiology of the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.920
heart which is quite interesting
and important to heart function.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.650
One of the--turns out that one
of the most important diagnostic

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.079
measurements that can be made is
through a device that was

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.050
designed by biomedical engineers
called an electrocardiograph.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.809
We'll talk about today sort of
the origins of electrical

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.234
activity in the heart,
the role that this electrical

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:45.880
activity plays in the function
of the heart,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.450
and then finally how--we'll
talk a little bit about how one

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.019
can measure that electrical
activity which comes from cells

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.302
in the heart,
sort of deep inside your body,

00:00:56.302 --> 00:00:59.860
but can be measured with
electrodes on the surface of

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.884
your body.
You'll get some more experience

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:06.464
with making those measurements
in section on Thursday

00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:09.567
afternoon.
This is--I apologize,

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:14.423
a rather complicated diagram,
but I wanted to show you a

00:01:14.423 --> 00:01:19.367
picture that would give you a
sense for sort of where the

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:24.400
electrical potential that all
cells have comes from.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.220
You know that cells are bathed
in an extracellular fluid and

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.329
that that extracellular fluid
contains molecules,

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.920
including ions or charged
molecules.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.756
In fact, the extracellular
fluid is very rich in a

00:01:37.756 --> 00:01:41.280
particular ion,
sodium, and has lesser amounts

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.708
of other ions,
potassium and calcium,

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:49.937
are the three most important in
the electrical activity of

00:01:49.937 --> 00:01:54.030
membranes;
sodium, potassium, and calcium.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.927
The extracellular space which
is up on the top here is filled

00:01:57.927 --> 00:01:59.876
with those ions,
in particular,

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:02.409
has a high concentration of
sodium.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.890
The intracellular space,
or inside the cell,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.180
also is a water-rich
environment and also has ions.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.726
The ion composition inside the
cell is different than the

00:02:13.726 --> 00:02:17.716
composition outside the cell in
that the sodium concentration is

00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:21.444
relatively low.
This chart here shows you for a

00:02:21.444 --> 00:02:25.434
typical cell sodium
concentration might be 15 mmol

00:02:25.434 --> 00:02:30.319
while the extracellular sodium
concentration is 145 mmol,

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.124
so almost ten-fold higher
sodium ion concentration outside

00:02:34.124 --> 00:02:37.724
the cell than inside the cell.
Well, now you know from

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.490
what you know about the
structure of lipid membranes

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.465
that charged molecules,
even though they're small,

00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:46.837
charged ions like sodium cannot
penetrate through a lipid

00:02:46.837 --> 00:02:49.350
bilayer,
so there's no way for sodium to

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.214
get through this lipid bilayer.
Even though there's a very

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:55.694
large difference in
concentration,

00:02:55.694 --> 00:03:00.205
these molecules of sodium on
the outside can't diffuse inside

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:04.639
because they can't permeate
through the lipid bilayer.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.425
Now, potassium,
notice, has a very high

00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:12.610
concentration inside the cell,
120 mmol,

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.346
and outside the cell the
concentration is low,

00:03:15.346 --> 00:03:18.205
4.5 mmol, so again a big
difference in potassium

00:03:18.205 --> 00:03:21.490
concentration but going in the
opposite direction.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.155
If the membrane was permeable,
sodium would diffuse in and

00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:31.147
potassium would diffuse out but
it can't through a plain lipid

00:03:31.147 --> 00:03:33.841
bilayer.
Well, you also know that

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:36.530
cell membranes are not just
lipid bilayers.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.199
They have proteins inserted in
them and we talked about

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:43.256
proteins that serve as
receptors, for example,

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:46.449
the insulin receptor that binds
to insulin.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.292
We talked about signal
transduction through those

00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:52.800
receptors a few weeks ago.
We also talked briefly about

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.632
the fact that some of these
proteins are transport proteins

00:03:56.632 --> 00:04:00.332
and their role in the cell
membrane is to allow molecules

00:04:00.332 --> 00:04:03.569
that the cell needs to come in
or to go out.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.569
The glucose transporter is an
example of that.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.348
The only way that glucose can
get inside cells to provide a

00:04:10.348 --> 00:04:14.126
substrate for a metabolism is
because there are specialized

00:04:14.126 --> 00:04:17.839
proteins in the membrane that
allow glucose to cross,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:21.596
in the same way there are
specialized proteins that allow

00:04:21.596 --> 00:04:25.165
ions to cross.
These proteins come in two

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:27.879
varieties.
Some are active transport

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:32.054
proteins like this one which is
called the sodium-potassium

00:04:32.054 --> 00:04:34.414
pump.
It's actually a little machine

00:04:34.414 --> 00:04:37.685
that sits inside the cell
membrane, it's a protein based

00:04:37.685 --> 00:04:41.368
machine.
Its job is to pump sodium out

00:04:41.368 --> 00:04:45.649
of the cell and potassium into
the cell;

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:48.839
sodium goes out potassium goes
in.

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:52.337
It's moving those molecules
against their concentration

00:04:52.337 --> 00:04:56.029
gradients and so energy is
required for that to happen.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:57.704
It doesn't happen
spontaneously,

00:04:57.704 --> 00:05:00.620
you can't move molecules,
molecules don't spontaneously

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.050
move from regions of low
concentration to high

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.965
concentration.
It requires energy and it gets

00:05:06.965 --> 00:05:10.315
its energy from ATP.
This is called the

00:05:10.315 --> 00:05:14.869
sodium-potassium pump and it's
ubiquitous in cells throughout

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:18.413
the body.
It's how cells maintain this

00:05:18.413 --> 00:05:23.679
low sodium concentration and
high potassium concentration

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:26.334
inside.
It's because they have these

00:05:26.334 --> 00:05:29.641
little machines in their
membranes that are continually

00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:32.030
pumping sodium out and potassium
in.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.626
Does that make sense?
It's the action of this pump

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:39.940
that causes these differences in
ions to occur.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.839
There are other proteins
that serve as channels.

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:47.250
You can think of these as very
specialized pores in the

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.639
membrane that allow ions to pass
through, and they're selective.

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.820
This one is a potassium
channel, and so if it is open it

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.399
allows to potassium to pass
through.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.079
It only allows passive
transport.

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:08.169
It's not a machine like the
other one, it's just a portal or

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.189
a hole that allows potassium to
move down its concentration

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.266
gradient.
If this potassium channel is

00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:18.529
open, then potassium will
naturally move.

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:21.054
It will move from high to low
concentration,

00:06:21.054 --> 00:06:23.990
that is, it'll move from inside
the cell to out.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:27.981
If sodium--if there's a channel
for sodium and it happens to be

00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:30.750
open, and that's what this is
shown here,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.867
a channel with the lid off
means the channel is open,

00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:39.143
then sodium can pass from its
high concentration to low

00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:43.181
concentration or from the
extracellular space to the

00:06:43.181 --> 00:06:47.649
intracellular space.
The cell is in dynamic

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:51.820
equilibrium, that in its sort of
steady state,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.387
it's natural state,
there is this active machine

00:06:56.387 --> 00:07:00.360
that's pumping sodium out and
potassium in.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.271
Then, there are these pores
that when they exist and when

00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:07.274
they're open,
are letting these molecules to

00:07:07.274 --> 00:07:11.021
leak back the other way.
The pump always has to be

00:07:11.021 --> 00:07:14.460
operating because the leak is
always happening.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.970
Does that make sense?
Because you have these

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.663
differences in ion
concentrations across the cell

00:07:23.663 --> 00:07:29.725
membrane these--and you have the
flux of molecules continuously

00:07:29.725 --> 00:07:33.693
across the membrane.
What I've shown here are

00:07:33.693 --> 00:07:37.629
channels that are--they have a
lid on them so they're sometimes

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:40.850
open and sometimes closed,
they can be both opened and

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.101
closed.
Every cell in your body at a

00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:47.180
given time is going to have lots
of potassium channels that are

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.470
open and lots of sodium channels
that are open.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:54.750
They're just some that are open
all the time.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.350
Because of that there's a
continual leakage of potassium

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:02.670
out of the cell and a continual
leakage of sodium into the cell.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.277
Well, if ions are moving
across the cell membrane,

00:08:07.277 --> 00:08:12.579
ions are charged molecules,
and that movement is a current.

00:08:12.579 --> 00:08:15.630
You usually think of currents
as movements of electrons but

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.997
movements of ions,
of positively charged ions,

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:20.839
is also current.
So, there's a continual current

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:24.133
flow across the membrane.
That continual current flow

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:27.519
causes a potential difference
across the membrane.

00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:31.703
Now, a membrane that's at rest,
that is in its resting state,

00:08:31.703 --> 00:08:35.607
is going to have a given number
of channels of sodium and

00:08:35.607 --> 00:08:40.494
potassium that are open.
So, there'll be given current

00:08:40.494 --> 00:08:46.464
of sodium that's flowing in and
a given current of potassium

00:08:46.464 --> 00:08:51.084
that's flowing out.
That's being compensated by the

00:08:51.084 --> 00:08:55.796
activity of this pump but this
current flow creates a membrane

00:08:55.796 --> 00:08:59.304
potential or voltage.
Just like a battery,

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:02.821
because these currents are
flowing, if I measure the

00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:06.821
electrical potential on both
sides of this membrane I would

00:09:06.821 --> 00:09:10.412
get a voltage difference.
It turns out that for most

00:09:10.412 --> 00:09:12.929
cells that voltage difference is
negative.

00:09:12.929 --> 00:09:16.578
The inside of the cell is
slightly negative compared to

00:09:16.578 --> 00:09:20.970
the outside of the cell and it's
in the range of -60 to -90 mV.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.812
That's the backdrop,
that's what you should think of

00:09:23.812 --> 00:09:26.320
as sort of the resting state of
a membrane,

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.132
it has these channels in it,
it exists in this fluid

00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:33.720
environment where there's high
sodium outside,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.583
high potassium inside,
current flows,

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:42.246
membrane potential generated.
To make it more complicated

00:09:42.246 --> 00:09:48.536
there are certain of these ion
channels that exist in open and

00:09:48.536 --> 00:09:52.695
closed states.
Those open and closed states

00:09:52.695 --> 00:09:56.990
are regulated by the voltage
across the membrane.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:01.330
Here's one called the voltage
dependent sodium channel.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:06.168
The resting state,
when the membrane voltage is,

00:10:06.168 --> 00:10:10.286
let's say, -90 mV,
the channel is closed,

00:10:10.286 --> 00:10:16.360
and so this channel does not
allow for sodium to enter.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.243
If it opens,
sodium now can enter through

00:10:20.243 --> 00:10:23.230
new channels.
If there are a lot of these

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.440
voltage-gated channels on the
surface.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:29.258
They sense a change in voltage,
and they all open,

00:10:29.258 --> 00:10:33.545
one can have a dramatic change
in the currents that flow

00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:38.143
through the membrane and hence a
dramatic change in membrane

00:10:38.143 --> 00:10:40.654
potential.
Now, that's exactly what

00:10:40.654 --> 00:10:42.549
happens when we have an action
potential.

00:10:42.549 --> 00:10:46.148
I show you this diagram that I
showed you a few weeks ago when

00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:49.097
we were talking about the
nervous system and how it

00:10:49.097 --> 00:10:51.699
communicates.
I explained it in sort of a

00:10:51.699 --> 00:10:54.780
superficial way then,
but now you can understand it a

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.335
little better if you think about
it in terms of these--of the

00:10:58.335 --> 00:11:02.008
membrane and the membrane having
channels that allow sodium and

00:11:02.008 --> 00:11:05.392
potassium to flow.
Under a resting condition they

00:11:05.392 --> 00:11:09.069
have a population of channels
that's always allowing sodium

00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:12.429
and potassium to flow,
that creates the potential.

00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:15.935
Then, they have special
channels that open when the

00:11:15.935 --> 00:11:18.389
voltage is disturbed in some
way.

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:23.877
Here, we're looking at a
trace of membrane potential in

00:11:23.877 --> 00:11:26.210
time.
Imagine that you're very small

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.383
and you're sitting on the
surface of this membrane but you

00:11:29.383 --> 00:11:32.054
have special shoes on that
measure the voltage or

00:11:32.054 --> 00:11:34.912
something.
You can experience the voltage,

00:11:34.912 --> 00:11:38.630
the potential drop across the
membrane by just standing on

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.015
this membrane.
You're standing there in the

00:11:41.015 --> 00:11:42.973
resting state,
so you're watching sodium and

00:11:42.973 --> 00:11:45.250
potassium go by because of their
normal fluxes,

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:53.970
and the potential that you
measure is, say -75 mV.

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:56.962
Now, something happens,
there's some disturbance in the

00:11:56.962 --> 00:11:59.678
membrane near you,
not right where you're standing

00:11:59.678 --> 00:12:01.840
but near you there's a
disturbance.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.657
That disturbance might be a
number of events but what we've

00:12:05.657 --> 00:12:09.541
thought about so far is that
there's a neurotransmitter that

00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:11.818
binds.
Somewhere upstream of you

00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:15.510
there's a neurotransmitter that
binds to a receptor and it

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:18.230
creates a change in membrane
potential.

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:23.200
A small change in membrane
potential, but you feel it.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.390
When you feel it at your sight
there's also these voltage

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:32.029
sensitive sodium channels that
exist in the membrane around you

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:36.220
and they go from the closed
state to the open state.

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.940
In response to this small
disturbance, some new channels

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.850
open, these happen to be sodium
channels.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.188
They open, a lot of them open
because there's a lot of them on

00:12:46.188 --> 00:12:49.527
your cell because your cell is
designed to respond to voltages

00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:52.100
so it has a lot of these kinds
of channels.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.460
Now, what happens when all
these new sodium channels open?

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:01.367
There's a rush of sodium from
outside the cell to inside the

00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:04.886
cell.
Sodium's positively charged,

00:13:04.886 --> 00:13:11.493
you get a rush of current going
by you, and that rush of current

00:13:11.493 --> 00:13:16.187
depolarizes the membrane.
Remember I said the membrane

00:13:16.187 --> 00:13:19.326
had a negative potential,
it's more negative on the

00:13:19.326 --> 00:13:22.143
inside than outside,
but all of a sudden you've

00:13:22.143 --> 00:13:25.470
opened all these sodium channels
and a rush of sodium goes in,

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.009
a rush of positively charged
molecules go into the cell,

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:32.548
make the inside of the cell
less negative because you're

00:13:32.548 --> 00:13:35.379
adding a lot more positive
charge to it.

00:13:35.379 --> 00:13:37.350
That event is called
depolarization.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.055
If you were standing on the
cell with your magic boots that

00:13:41.055 --> 00:13:44.696
were electrically active somehow
you would experience this

00:13:44.696 --> 00:13:47.379
dramatic change in membrane
potential.

00:13:47.379 --> 00:13:51.718
The membrane becoming a lot
less negatively charged,

00:13:51.718 --> 00:13:55.584
even positively charged.
That's due totally to this rush

00:13:55.584 --> 00:13:58.519
of sodium through these new
channels that have opened.

00:13:58.519 --> 00:14:02.665
Well, there's a second set
of channels called potassium,

00:14:02.665 --> 00:14:06.178
voltage-gated potassium
channels that also open but

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:09.269
they're slower than the sodium
channels.

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:12.784
When they open they allow a lot
more potassium to rush the other

00:14:12.784 --> 00:14:15.797
way because, you remember,
potassium is high inside and

00:14:15.797 --> 00:14:18.099
low outside.
First you get a rush of current

00:14:18.099 --> 00:14:20.509
going in one direction,
then you get a rush of current

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:23.067
going in the other.
What causes in terms of

00:14:23.067 --> 00:14:26.048
membrane potential is a rapid
depolarization,

00:14:26.048 --> 00:14:30.112
and then a rapid repolarization
and these channels eventually

00:14:30.112 --> 00:14:34.379
close again and the membrane
returns to its resting state.

00:14:34.379 --> 00:14:37.111
If you don't understand all the
details of that,

00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:39.551
that's fine,
it's described in the book and

00:14:39.551 --> 00:14:43.212
also described in other membrane
physiology books that you could

00:14:43.212 --> 00:14:45.266
go to.
It's not important that you

00:14:45.266 --> 00:14:47.980
understand all the details but
that you have a sense for what's

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.777
happening,
is that within this small

00:14:49.777 --> 00:14:52.723
region of the cell membrane we
focused on there was some kind

00:14:52.723 --> 00:14:55.453
of a small disturbance,
it opened all these

00:14:55.453 --> 00:14:59.508
voltage-gated channels,
caused rushes of current which

00:14:59.508 --> 00:15:03.919
changed the membrane potential.
That is, in this case what I've

00:15:03.919 --> 00:15:06.370
described to you,
is an action potential.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:10.928
A small change here causes a
large change at my local site,

00:15:10.928 --> 00:15:13.679
and then I pass that on this
way,

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:16.790
because I'm now standing at the
site where there's a huge

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.678
disturbance in membrane
potential and that's going to

00:15:19.678 --> 00:15:24.090
cause some current to flow,
a little bit to flow downstream.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.987
That little bit that flows
downstream is going to cause the

00:15:27.987 --> 00:15:32.153
voltage-gated channels here to
open, and an action potential to

00:15:32.153 --> 00:15:35.590
be generated at this site.
If you follow that line of

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.648
thinking, then an initial
disturbance over here creates a

00:15:38.648 --> 00:15:41.955
massive membrane potential here,
which moves to here,

00:15:41.955 --> 00:15:44.745
which moves to here,
which moves to here,

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:49.350
and that's an action potential
being transmitted down a neuron.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.898
Make sense?
That's what we talked about

00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:53.730
when we were talking about the
nervous system.

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.166
We were talking about
information flowing from

00:15:57.166 --> 00:16:02.129
dendrites, dendrites that have
receptors for neurotransmitters,

00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:04.941
those receptors for
neurotransmitters causing a

00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:08.546
small membrane disturbance which
then gets converted into an

00:16:08.546 --> 00:16:11.960
action potential.
That action potential moves

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.354
down the axon,
say in this direction to that

00:16:15.354 --> 00:16:16.380
direction.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.613
Why doesn't it move back?
Why does it only move in one

00:16:24.613 --> 00:16:27.930
direction?
Well, it turns out that it's

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:33.085
very interesting physiology that
when these membrane--when these

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:38.239
voltage-gated membrane channels
get opened they become incapable

00:16:38.239 --> 00:16:42.330
of being reactivated for some
period of time.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:45.233
The voltage-gated sodium
channels open,

00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:49.520
they close, and then they can't
be opened again for some period

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.962
of time.
Just a few milliseconds but

00:16:51.962 --> 00:16:55.307
long enough for the action
potential to pass out of their

00:16:55.307 --> 00:16:58.591
region so that you don't get
currents that flow like--or

00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:01.159
action potentials that flow like
this.

00:17:01.159 --> 00:17:07.070
They only flow in one direction
because these channels need to

00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.420
recover.
You understand now a little bit

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.105
more about why action potentials
flow down axons and when they

00:17:15.105 --> 00:17:17.947
reach these termini,
the axon termini,

00:17:17.947 --> 00:17:21.799
what do they do?
This sudden change in membrane

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:26.056
potential activates a new
process, and that new process is

00:17:26.056 --> 00:17:29.640
release of neurotransmitter from
the synapse.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.995
That neurotransmitter then
activates another cell,

00:17:32.995 --> 00:17:36.831
generating an action potential,
sending it down its axon,

00:17:36.831 --> 00:17:39.518
and so on.
In the nervous system

00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:42.561
messages pass from
neurotransmitter to action

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.673
potential, neurotransmitter,
action potential,

00:17:45.673 --> 00:17:48.440
neurotransmitter,
action potential.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.856
Because there might be many,
many neurons impinging on one

00:17:52.856 --> 00:17:56.885
particular neuron that I'm
interested in and some are

00:17:56.885 --> 00:18:00.942
sending positive messages,
some are sending negative

00:18:00.942 --> 00:18:04.059
messages, sending these little
disturbances.

00:18:04.059 --> 00:18:08.871
Whether this axon generates an
action potential or not depends

00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:13.682
on the sum total of the small
disturbances that it's receiving

00:18:13.682 --> 00:18:16.359
at any one time,
Neurons can integrate

00:18:16.359 --> 00:18:17.040
information.

00:18:20.089 --> 00:18:23.266
That information is acquired
from all the neurotransmitters

00:18:23.266 --> 00:18:26.059
that are impinging on the
dendrites that cause small

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:29.509
disturbances that may or may not
add up to the large disturbance

00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:31.700
which becomes an action
potential.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.768
You go on to study neuroscience
or just physiology,

00:18:34.768 --> 00:18:38.204
you'll learn more about this
but I think you can probably

00:18:38.204 --> 00:18:41.727
understand the basic concept.
In the action potential and a

00:18:41.727 --> 00:18:44.980
neuron we were thinking about a
cell that had a receiving end,

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.674
that receives neurotransmitter
inputs, that causes membrane

00:18:48.674 --> 00:18:51.784
potentials to change,
that somehow decides to

00:18:51.784 --> 00:18:55.364
initiate an action potential.
That action potential flows

00:18:55.364 --> 00:18:58.074
very rapidly down this
specialized process called an

00:18:58.074 --> 00:19:01.248
axon,
reaching the axon termini,

00:19:01.248 --> 00:19:07.380
and then neurotransmitters are
released to the next cell.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:14.910
Heart cells are the same in
that they contain these special

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:20.876
voltage-gated membrane channels,
these voltage-gated ion

00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:25.109
channels that allow for an
action potential to form.

00:19:25.109 --> 00:19:29.034
They're capable of doing an
action potential because they

00:19:29.034 --> 00:19:33.029
have these voltage-gated sodium
and potassium channels.

00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:36.573
Because of that,
heart muscle cells fall into

00:19:36.573 --> 00:19:41.566
the same category as nervous--of
neurons in that they're in the

00:19:41.566 --> 00:19:45.109
general category called
excitable cells.

00:19:45.109 --> 00:19:47.895
They're excitable cells,
means they're capable of making

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.922
an action potential.
To have an action potential

00:19:50.922 --> 00:19:54.604
they need to have these
specialized voltage-gated ion

00:19:54.604 --> 00:19:59.095
channels in their membranes.
Cardiac myocytes have that,

00:19:59.095 --> 00:20:01.900
they also have actin and
myosin.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:06.469
They're muscle cells and
they're capable of contracting,

00:20:06.469 --> 00:20:10.789
meaning that this myocyte here
can shorten itself.

00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:15.224
It can make itself shorter by
contracting just like a muscle,

00:20:15.224 --> 00:20:19.346
a whole muscle contracts.
That's different than

00:20:19.346 --> 00:20:23.769
neurons so they have this
capacity to transmit action

00:20:23.769 --> 00:20:26.288
potentials;
they have this capacity to

00:20:26.288 --> 00:20:27.784
contract.
Now, in muscle cells,

00:20:27.784 --> 00:20:30.410
as we'll see in a few minutes,
those things are linked.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:33.497
When a muscle cell experiences
an action potential it doesn't

00:20:33.497 --> 00:20:36.605
do what a nerve cells does,
which is pass that information

00:20:36.605 --> 00:20:39.030
along to another cell via
neurotransmitters,

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:47.919
instead it contracts.
It also passes along the action

00:20:47.919 --> 00:20:52.166
potential but it doesn't do that
through a chemical synapse like

00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:54.745
in neurons,
it does it through an

00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:59.495
electrical synapse in that these
cells are very tightly welded

00:20:59.495 --> 00:21:02.114
together.
Remember we talked about in the

00:21:02.114 --> 00:21:04.560
nervous system,
the two cells don't physically

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.330
touch,
there's a space in between

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.088
that's called the synapse and
it's over this synapse that

00:21:09.088 --> 00:21:11.938
neurotransmitters act.
They're released from the

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:15.045
pre-synaptic cell and they
create a change in the

00:21:15.045 --> 00:21:19.016
post-synaptic cell.
Cardiac myocytes are basically

00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:22.112
welded together.
In fact, there are special

00:21:22.112 --> 00:21:25.924
junctions called gap junctions
in between them that allow the

00:21:25.924 --> 00:21:29.038
easy flow of current.
If an action potential

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:32.460
flows through this myocyte,
from this end to the other,

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.890
it doesn't have to--it
basically flows straight into

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:40.059
the next cell because they're
directly electrically coupled.

00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:44.646
If an action potential arises
and comes from this direction,

00:21:44.646 --> 00:21:47.990
it flows very quickly down this
membrane,

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.565
it causes this cell to
contract, it flows right into

00:21:51.565 --> 00:21:54.789
the next cell causing this cell
to contract,

00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:59.970
flows right into the next cell
causing it to contract.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:06.216
So, in cardiac muscle wherever
the action potential starts it

00:22:06.216 --> 00:22:10.683
contracts first,
then the action potential flows

00:22:10.683 --> 00:22:14.279
into the neighboring cells,
they contract.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:18.517
You can think about the cardiac
myocardium, the sheet that I

00:22:18.517 --> 00:22:21.545
showed you last time,
the muscular walls of the

00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:24.734
heart, as being sort of a sheet
of these cells that are all

00:22:24.734 --> 00:22:27.831
connected to each other.
If I start an action potential

00:22:27.831 --> 00:22:29.979
in one space,
it's going to flow over the

00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:33.188
surface.
As it flows over the surface

00:22:33.188 --> 00:22:37.210
cells will be contracting right
behind it;

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.988
so electrical flow followed
immediately by contraction

00:22:41.988 --> 00:22:44.420
locally.
Does that make sense?

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:48.619
You could imagine that this
now--because they're directly

00:22:48.619 --> 00:22:52.119
electrically coupled,
signals can pass very quickly

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:55.893
over the surface of the heart.
They can pass very quickly from

00:22:55.893 --> 00:22:57.737
one to another,
so I just need to start an

00:22:57.737 --> 00:23:00.660
action potential in one place,
it'll be propagated everywhere.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.077
I might like to control that
because I'd like to have the

00:23:04.077 --> 00:23:07.251
heartbeat function in this
controlled fashion we were

00:23:07.251 --> 00:23:11.428
talking about last time.
So how does the heart solve

00:23:11.428 --> 00:23:16.823
this problem of control of how
this wave of action potential

00:23:16.823 --> 00:23:20.390
moves over the surface of the
heart?

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.278
Well, it does that through a
specialized group of pathways

00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:28.440
that are collectively called the
cardiac conduction system.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.720
This is a terrible diagram.
I'm going to show you the next

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.130
one, I'll show you a little bit
better on the next one,

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.038
and so you'll see,
it but imagine--just look at

00:23:37.038 --> 00:23:39.269
the surface here.
This is the heart,

00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:41.269
the left ventricle,
the left atrium,

00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:43.384
the right ventricle,
the right atrium,

00:23:43.384 --> 00:23:47.072
and there's this pathway.
The heart has something like a

00:23:47.072 --> 00:23:50.819
nervous system in that this
black region here is a pathway

00:23:50.819 --> 00:23:53.910
that's called the cardiac
conduction system.

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.430
It consists of several
important points.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:24:02.829
The first is called the
sinoatrial node or SA node and

00:24:02.829 --> 00:24:08.291
it's in the right atrium.
The next point is the atrial

00:24:08.291 --> 00:24:13.007
ventricular node which sits on a
fibrous substance called the

00:24:13.007 --> 00:24:17.410
septum which separates the atria
from the ventricles.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.710
The heart is kind of tilted to
one side, it's not straight up

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.065
and down, so the atria are up
here and the ventricles are down

00:24:24.065 --> 00:24:27.482
here,
there's a septum in between and

00:24:27.482 --> 00:24:32.545
that's where this AV node sits.
It turns out that this

00:24:32.545 --> 00:24:36.557
septum is electrically
insulating and so if a action

00:24:36.557 --> 00:24:41.041
potential--a wave of action
potential gets generated up in

00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:44.355
the atrium,
it stops when it hits the

00:24:44.355 --> 00:24:48.630
septum, it doesn't move directly
to the ventricles.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:52.282
The muscles of the atrium and
the muscles of the ventricle are

00:24:52.282 --> 00:24:55.927
electrically isolated.
The only point of connection

00:24:55.927 --> 00:25:00.579
between them is this specialized
fiber pathway called the AV

00:25:00.579 --> 00:25:03.908
node.
That AV node leads into a

00:25:03.908 --> 00:25:10.599
series of branching fibers that
are called the Purkinje system,

00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:16.900
Purkinje fibers down here.
These are fibers that very

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:22.508
rapidly conduct action
potentials or electrical

00:25:22.508 --> 00:25:25.665
signals.
What I want you to see in this

00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:28.753
slide is to notice that while
all of these cells are

00:25:28.753 --> 00:25:31.836
excitable,
they have the property of

00:25:31.836 --> 00:25:35.970
generating and sustaining an
action potential,

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:39.414
they're excitable,
an action potential can be

00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:42.502
generated--the shape of the
action potential varies in

00:25:42.502 --> 00:25:44.917
different cells.
That's all this diagram

00:25:44.917 --> 00:25:47.242
shows you.
You don't need to know the

00:25:47.242 --> 00:25:50.759
details but notice that some
things are different.

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:54.304
For example,
in the SA node it's a very slow

00:25:54.304 --> 00:25:59.498
rise of potential followed by a
slow fall and then a much slower

00:25:59.498 --> 00:26:03.289
rise again compared to
ventricular muscle,

00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:07.121
for example,
that has a very rapid uptake,

00:26:07.121 --> 00:26:11.606
a sustained depolarization
phase and then a rapid

00:26:11.606 --> 00:26:16.452
repolarization back to baseline.
There are differences in the

00:26:16.452 --> 00:26:19.099
ways that these things undergo
action potentials.

00:26:19.099 --> 00:26:20.670
What do you think that's based
on?

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.769
What's different about these
cells?

00:26:23.769 --> 00:26:26.644
Well, if the action potential
is the result of these

00:26:26.644 --> 00:26:30.026
voltage-gated channels that must
mean that ventricular muscle

00:26:30.026 --> 00:26:33.351
cells have a different set of
voltage-gated channels than SA

00:26:33.351 --> 00:26:35.733
node cells.
They might have totally

00:26:35.733 --> 00:26:39.137
different molecules that are
doing the transport or they

00:26:39.137 --> 00:26:42.480
might just have different
numbers of these molecules in

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:46.776
their membranes,
but that's the difference in

00:26:46.776 --> 00:26:49.797
physiology.
What we're going to get to

00:26:49.797 --> 00:26:53.215
the by the end here is I'm going
to try to convince you that

00:26:53.215 --> 00:26:56.169
this--these changes that are
occurring in individual

00:26:56.169 --> 00:26:59.541
myocytes,
this rush of current that

00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:05.586
underlies the action potential
generation is what we measure

00:27:05.586 --> 00:27:10.239
when we measure an EKG.
That what you're measuring is

00:27:10.239 --> 00:27:14.423
sort of the sum of all of these
electrical potentials that are

00:27:14.423 --> 00:27:18.334
occurring as your heartbeat
changes in electrical--because

00:27:18.334 --> 00:27:21.558
your heart cells are all
experiencing changes in

00:27:21.558 --> 00:27:25.742
electrical potential and because
your body is basically a salt

00:27:25.742 --> 00:27:28.829
solution which conducts
electricity,

00:27:28.829 --> 00:27:32.804
that you can measure those
changes in electrical potential

00:27:32.804 --> 00:27:37.196
happening in cells in the heart
by having electrodes just on the

00:27:37.196 --> 00:27:41.200
surface of your skin.
The EKG arises from all of

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.331
these action potentials that are
happening within all of the

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:49.809
thousands of cells within your
heart.

00:27:49.809 --> 00:27:52.230
This diagram is a little easier
to understand.

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.710
It had more words than I liked
so I blocked some of them out.

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:58.389
The other one are things that
we've already talked about

00:27:58.389 --> 00:28:01.400
before, the SA node is now
familiar to you,

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.141
the sinoatrial node,
the AV node,

00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:09.366
this specialized bundle of His
which carries potential--action

00:28:09.366 --> 00:28:14.506
potentials very quickly from the
AV node down to the Purkinje

00:28:14.506 --> 00:28:17.850
system,
and the Purkinje system which

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:21.079
branches throughout the
ventricular wall.

00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:23.769
How does--is a heartbeat
regulated?

00:28:23.769 --> 00:28:27.274
It turns out that some of these
cells are capable of generating

00:28:27.274 --> 00:28:29.968
their own action potentials.
They don't need to be

00:28:29.968 --> 00:28:31.869
stimulated by some outside
disturbance;

00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:34.430
they generate an action
potential on their own.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:38.690
The most famous of these is the
SA node up here.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:40.736
The SA node,
if you look at it,

00:28:40.736 --> 00:28:44.693
here's the action potential in
the SA node, depolarization,

00:28:44.693 --> 00:28:47.900
repolarization,
now look what happens here.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.503
The cell, when most membranes
we've talked about are at

00:28:51.503 --> 00:28:54.373
resting state,
resting state such that their

00:28:54.373 --> 00:28:58.044
membrane potential stays
constant until its disturbed by

00:28:58.044 --> 00:29:02.496
something from outside,
this cell actually is slowly

00:29:02.496 --> 00:29:06.450
changing its membrane potential
on its own.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:10.055
It does that with a very
consistent frequency,

00:29:10.055 --> 00:29:14.862
such that at some point this
slow rise of action potential is

00:29:14.862 --> 00:29:19.189
going--this slow rise of
membrane potential is going to

00:29:19.189 --> 00:29:23.916
go high enough that it causes
its own disturbance and causes

00:29:23.916 --> 00:29:27.585
its own action potential.
This is called a

00:29:27.585 --> 00:29:29.380
self-propagating action
potential.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.610
Cells like cells of the SA node
that are capable of doing this

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:36.940
have special properties of their
ion channels.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:41.417
The end result is that the SA
node is just making action

00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:44.430
potentials on a very regular
basis.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:46.478
If you measured,
if you put an electrode,

00:29:46.478 --> 00:29:49.602
or if you shrunk yourself and
you had your magic boots and you

00:29:49.602 --> 00:29:53.685
could stand on the SA node,
you would measure an action

00:29:53.685 --> 00:29:56.920
potential about 60 times a
minute.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.634
Once a second,
the SA node is just creating an

00:29:59.634 --> 00:30:01.927
action potential.
Now, when it creates that

00:30:01.927 --> 00:30:05.852
action potential what happens?
It disturbs the cells that are

00:30:05.852 --> 00:30:08.858
around it.
When the SA node creates an

00:30:08.858 --> 00:30:13.500
action potential it causes a
voltage disturbance in the cells

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.599
around it and they start making
action potentials.

00:30:17.599 --> 00:30:21.999
Starting from this source in
the SA node, a wave of action

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:26.630
potentials starts to move over
the atrium, over the atria.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:31.445
First the right and then the
left, and what happens as this

00:30:31.445 --> 00:30:35.680
wave of action potentials
spreads over the atria?

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.930
What happens--what else do
muscle cells do?

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:42.285
They contract,
and so a self-propagating

00:30:42.285 --> 00:30:47.706
action potential in the SA node
induces an action potential wave

00:30:47.706 --> 00:30:52.660
that spreads over the atria,
the atria contract.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.769
They contract--if you watch
them they contract from the

00:30:55.769 --> 00:30:59.569
region of the SA node out to the
right slightly before the left,

00:30:59.569 --> 00:31:03.611
but it passes pretty fast over
these relatively small surface

00:31:03.611 --> 00:31:06.265
areas.
Now, remember that there's

00:31:06.265 --> 00:31:10.636
a septum in between the atrium
and the ventricle so this action

00:31:10.636 --> 00:31:14.655
potential wave would stop and
not go down to the ventricle

00:31:14.655 --> 00:31:18.771
except for the AV node.
When the action potential comes

00:31:18.771 --> 00:31:22.295
down these pathways,
these specialized pathways from

00:31:22.295 --> 00:31:24.990
the SA node, it reaches the AV
node.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:29.091
The AV node has another special
property in that when it's

00:31:29.091 --> 00:31:33.049
stimulated to make an action
potential, it hesitates.

00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:37.879
It hesitates for a fraction of
a second and then it starts its

00:31:37.879 --> 00:31:40.681
own action potential.
So, it receives the

00:31:40.681 --> 00:31:43.418
disturbance, it waits and then
it makes its own action

00:31:43.418 --> 00:31:46.140
potential.
What happens?

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.331
Start to put the picture
together now,

00:31:48.331 --> 00:31:51.647
SA node action potential,
wave of action potential of the

00:31:51.647 --> 00:31:53.667
atria,
contraction of the atria,

00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:56.523
AV node gets the signal,
waits, generates an action

00:31:56.523 --> 00:31:59.550
potential and that action
potential quickly propagates

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.920
down through the bundle of His
in the Purkinje system.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.387
What do they do?
They carry this action

00:32:06.387 --> 00:32:09.049
potential down into the
ventricles.

00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:11.781
They start action potentials in
the ventricle,

00:32:11.781 --> 00:32:15.119
which then passes a wave over
the ventricular muscle,

00:32:15.119 --> 00:32:19.992
and after that wave of action
potentials comes contraction and

00:32:19.992 --> 00:32:26.113
ventricular contraction.
Now, why does the AV node

00:32:26.113 --> 00:32:28.592
wait?
It waits in order to control

00:32:28.592 --> 00:32:31.759
the heartbeat in the way that we
described last time,

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:36.367
so that you want the atria to
contract and deliver their blood

00:32:36.367 --> 00:32:40.900
to the ventricles before the
ventricle starts to contract.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.187
You want the ventricle to wait
until it's filled up with blood

00:32:44.187 --> 00:32:47.259
from the atrial contraction and
then start to contract.

00:32:47.259 --> 00:32:51.472
So, the AV node provides that
separation in time of the atrial

00:32:51.472 --> 00:32:54.650
contractions and the ventricle
contractions.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:58.154
Now, how would you like the
ventricular--now remember when

00:32:58.154 --> 00:33:01.719
the ventricle contracts it's a
big contraction and wants to

00:33:01.719 --> 00:33:05.052
force blood in what direction?
Up out of the top,

00:33:05.052 --> 00:33:08.710
that's where the pulmonary
artery and the aorta are;

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.670
remember from the model they're
up at the top of the heart.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:16.416
So, you would like for this
muscle to very effectively eject

00:33:16.416 --> 00:33:20.841
blood out of the ventricular
chambers and into these two

00:33:20.841 --> 00:33:25.644
large vessels.
You all have roommates,

00:33:25.644 --> 00:33:27.948
true;
I don't know if you all share

00:33:27.948 --> 00:33:30.849
toothpaste with your roommates,
but if you do then some

00:33:30.849 --> 00:33:32.943
fraction of you,
probably about half,

00:33:32.943 --> 00:33:35.840
are irritated with your
roommates because they grab the

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.835
toothpaste tube at the top.
You might have brothers and

00:33:38.835 --> 00:33:41.348
sisters who do this,
they grab it near the top and

00:33:41.348 --> 00:33:44.272
they squeeze it because they
only care about getting their

00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:47.094
little toothpaste out and so you
get this--that's not an

00:33:47.094 --> 00:33:49.299
effective way to get toothpaste
out,

00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:51.942
squeezing it from the top
because some of the energy goes

00:33:51.942 --> 00:33:54.772
down into the bottom and forces
this toothpaste down here and

00:33:54.772 --> 00:33:56.660
the thing gets all out of the
shape.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:02.901
What if you wanted to get all
of the toothpaste out of the

00:34:02.901 --> 00:34:07.609
tube on one squeeze,
how would you do it?

00:34:07.609 --> 00:34:10.726
You'd go from the bottom up,
you'd starting squeezing from

00:34:10.726 --> 00:34:12.750
the bottom and you'd squeeze it
up.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.574
If you were good at this,
and you could practice this at

00:34:15.574 --> 00:34:18.810
home, you get toothpaste and you
could see how much of the--what

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.429
fraction you can get out with a
single squeeze.

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:24.180
I think you'd find your best is
to start from the bottom and

00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.930
squeeze sort of systematically
going up, and that's what the

00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:29.559
heart does.
That's why this Purkinje system

00:34:29.559 --> 00:34:31.801
is here;
too rapidly conduct signals

00:34:31.801 --> 00:34:35.539
from the SA node down to the
base of the ventricle and really

00:34:35.539 --> 00:34:41.472
start the contraction down here.
The contraction starts at the

00:34:41.472 --> 00:34:48.590
bottom and squeezes up and the
blood is propelled out.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:52.894
One of the roles of the
Purkinje system is to carry this

00:34:52.894 --> 00:34:57.511
potential into the ventricles in
a way that provides maximum

00:34:57.511 --> 00:35:02.050
benefit from the contraction of
the cells that result.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.817
Now, a couple of other
things that are interesting to

00:35:04.817 --> 00:35:07.000
know here.
One is that the SA node is not

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.182
the only collection of cells in
the heart that are capable of

00:35:10.182 --> 00:35:12.409
generating their own action
potentials.

00:35:12.409 --> 00:35:16.144
Actually the AV node is also
capable of generating the action

00:35:16.144 --> 00:35:19.630
potential and so are the cells
in the Purkinje system.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.518
They all can generate action
potentials, but it turns out

00:35:22.518 --> 00:35:24.530
that the SA node does it the
fastest.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:27.130
It does it about 60 beats per
minute.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:31.010
The AV node does it at maybe 40
beats per minute and the

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:34.890
Purkinje fibers do it at even a
lower rate than that.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.462
What does that mean?
It means that the SA node is

00:35:38.462 --> 00:35:41.420
functioning properly,
the AV node doesn't matter what

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:44.889
it's doing in terms of automatic
generation of potentials,

00:35:44.889 --> 00:35:49.223
because that potential that was
first generated by the SA node

00:35:49.223 --> 00:35:53.700
arrives at the AV node before it
generates its own potential.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:58.629
Who determines the heart rate?
The fastest beating automatic

00:35:58.629 --> 00:36:00.909
cell and those are generally in
the SA node.

00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:05.784
What happens if you have a
disease in your SA node and it

00:36:05.784 --> 00:36:09.700
stops functioning?
Then the AV node will take over

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.690
because it's no longer being
stimulated by the SA nodes

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:17.090
action potential and the wave
that results,

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:20.584
it will start beating but the
heart will beat slower,

00:36:20.584 --> 00:36:23.809
it will beat at 40 beats per
minute let's say.

00:36:23.809 --> 00:36:27.908
If you had some disease there
and that didn't work anymore

00:36:27.908 --> 00:36:32.222
than the Purkinje system--so the
heart has sort of a failsafe

00:36:32.222 --> 00:36:36.321
system built in such that if
this automatic beat generator

00:36:36.321 --> 00:36:40.304
fails there are inferior,
not such good quality,

00:36:40.304 --> 00:36:44.212
but still capable beat
generators further down the

00:36:44.212 --> 00:36:46.170
line.
Often those--the AV node

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.579
itself, you're not going to be
able to function in the same way

00:36:49.579 --> 00:36:52.989
because you're not going to get
the same cardiac output because

00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:55.409
you're heart isn't beating fast
enough.

00:36:55.409 --> 00:36:59.773
There are ways to treat
that now, and the most common

00:36:59.773 --> 00:37:03.980
way of treating that is by
putting a pacemaker into the

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:06.001
heart.
The pacemaker is a device

00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:08.584
designed by biomedical
engineers, about the size of a

00:37:08.584 --> 00:37:10.910
hockey puck,
but now even smaller than that,

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.019
that sits in your chest and it
basically does what the SA node

00:37:14.019 --> 00:37:17.421
is supposed to do,
generates a potential with a

00:37:17.421 --> 00:37:21.471
very regular period.
There's a wire that goes from

00:37:21.471 --> 00:37:26.550
this artificial device into your
heart, into the atrial muscle,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:31.909
and sits there and stimulates
the tissue around the SA node to

00:37:31.909 --> 00:37:35.780
replace its function,
so that's how a pacemaker works.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.207
This technology has evolved to
the point where there's sort of

00:37:39.207 --> 00:37:41.230
wireless--you can send signals
in,

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.641
you could change the rate,
you can reprogram the pacemaker

00:37:43.641 --> 00:37:45.840
without having to take it out
and actually physically

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.176
reprogram it,
so these are quite

00:37:48.176 --> 00:37:51.679
sophisticated engineering
devices now.

00:37:51.679 --> 00:37:54.485
I said something about
action potentials and ion

00:37:54.485 --> 00:37:57.421
currents.
I'm not going to say anything

00:37:57.421 --> 00:38:01.410
more about that now.
I will say that in neurons what

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.938
is important in a propagation of
an action potential is sodium

00:38:05.938 --> 00:38:08.810
and potassium,
but in muscle cells calcium is

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.690
also a much more important
player.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:14.148
The reason that calcium is a
much more important player is,

00:38:14.148 --> 00:38:17.070
as you will learn if you study
more physiology,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:22.801
calcium is the most important
ion in terms of initiating

00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:27.061
contraction.
So, movement of calcium around

00:38:27.061 --> 00:38:32.081
muscle cells is very important.
This just shows an action

00:38:32.081 --> 00:38:34.112
potential in,
for example,

00:38:34.112 --> 00:38:38.049
a ventricular cell.
It has this rapid upstroke,

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:42.030
this plateau in depolarization
and this recovery.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:44.631
So, this might be an action
potential you'd record from a

00:38:44.631 --> 00:38:47.310
ventricular muscle cell,
and if at the same time you

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.198
were recording this action
potential and you were also

00:38:50.198 --> 00:38:53.410
measuring contraction.
Think of this measurement as

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.309
how much contraction the cell
has done, at this point in its

00:38:57.309 --> 00:39:01.143
resting state and in this point
it's in its most contracted

00:39:01.143 --> 00:39:04.179
state,
then the contraction follows

00:39:04.179 --> 00:39:08.139
the action potential by about
100 milliseconds.

00:39:08.139 --> 00:39:12.411
As the contraction happens--as
the action potential happens the

00:39:12.411 --> 00:39:16.337
contraction happens about
100-150 milliseconds after that,

00:39:16.337 --> 00:39:20.420
the maximum response;
but these things are coupled

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:22.950
but they're not simultaneous.

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:31.900
I think I've covered what's
shown in this slide here.

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:35.428
This is just a simpler version
of what we've talked about,

00:39:35.428 --> 00:39:39.019
generation of the signal in the
SA node, movement to the AV

00:39:39.019 --> 00:39:42.388
node, hesitation.
Then, movement of this signal

00:39:42.388 --> 00:39:46.739
down the septum in between the
left and the right ventricle,

00:39:46.739 --> 00:39:51.444
through the Purkinje system,
and the heartbeat being

00:39:51.444 --> 00:39:55.780
generated in this regular
anatomical pattern.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.893
That happens because these
specialized tissues are able to

00:39:59.893 --> 00:40:03.552
conduct signals very rapidly,
and you can see here in this

00:40:03.552 --> 00:40:06.447
slide, this is how fast a signal
the velocity of an action

00:40:06.447 --> 00:40:09.292
potential being propagated
through different tissues goes

00:40:09.292 --> 00:40:12.289
very rapidly through pathways
like through the atrium,

00:40:12.289 --> 00:40:15.364
through the bundle of His,
and very rapidly through the

00:40:15.364 --> 00:40:18.515
Purkinje system.
That's why the signal gets

00:40:18.515 --> 00:40:23.584
transmitted so rapidly from the
AV node down to the base of the

00:40:23.584 --> 00:40:26.883
heart.
These diagrams are in the Power

00:40:26.883 --> 00:40:30.716
Points which are posted.
I just encourage you to look at

00:40:30.716 --> 00:40:34.248
them, together with reading the
chapter and hopefully that will

00:40:34.248 --> 00:40:36.469
help you to understand this
process.

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:39.461
Which brings us back to
thinking, at the end,

00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:42.702
about what I've talked about
several times during the

00:40:42.702 --> 00:40:45.158
lecture;
that is, that you can measure

00:40:45.158 --> 00:40:48.810
something about the physiology
of the heart by measuring all of

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:52.506
this electrical activity.
One way to measure it would be

00:40:52.506 --> 00:40:56.532
to put electrodes directly into
the heart and physically put

00:40:56.532 --> 00:41:00.148
them right near the site of
action and measure exactly

00:41:00.148 --> 00:41:03.317
what's happening.
That could be--you could get a

00:41:03.317 --> 00:41:06.929
very detailed picture of what's
happening in the heart that way.

00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:10.989
That can be done but that's an
invasive process.

00:41:10.989 --> 00:41:14.615
There are cardiologists that do
that, they do this everyday on

00:41:14.615 --> 00:41:16.879
people.
They put a catheter into your

00:41:16.879 --> 00:41:20.099
heart, a catheter that goes
through one of the vessels,

00:41:20.099 --> 00:41:23.602
an artery in your leg.
It's pushed up into the heart

00:41:23.602 --> 00:41:27.627
and then there are recording
electrodes on the end and they

00:41:27.627 --> 00:41:31.444
can measure electrical activity
directly in the heart at

00:41:31.444 --> 00:41:34.552
different locations.
That's called cardiac

00:41:34.552 --> 00:41:37.494
catheterization and cardiac
electrophysiology,

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:41.219
and it's widely used to
diagnose disease in the heart.

00:41:41.219 --> 00:41:43.469
That's usually not the
first thing you do because

00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:47.382
that's an invasive procedure.
What is important about EKG is

00:41:47.382 --> 00:41:50.815
that it's not invasive.
You can do it without entering

00:41:50.815 --> 00:41:53.382
the body, by just measuring
something that's happening on

00:41:53.382 --> 00:41:55.604
the surface.
You can do it very simply by

00:41:55.604 --> 00:41:58.619
placing electrodes at different
positions on the body.

00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:03.633
You've all seen a diagram like
this that shows a typical trace

00:42:03.633 --> 00:42:07.250
of an EKG, it's measured in
milivolt here,

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.713
it's a relatively small
potential because there's some

00:42:10.713 --> 00:42:14.568
distance--the potentials that
were actually generated in the

00:42:14.568 --> 00:42:17.711
heart are tens of milivolts,
but you're measuring at a

00:42:17.711 --> 00:42:19.900
distance away and so that
signal's been attenuated,

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:24.079
you're only measuring fractions
of a milivolt at the surface.

00:42:24.079 --> 00:42:29.066
What you see is a little bump,
followed by a delay,

00:42:29.066 --> 00:42:33.853
followed by a very big wave,
followed by a delay,

00:42:33.853 --> 00:42:39.039
followed by one and sometimes
two smaller waves.

00:42:39.039 --> 00:42:43.556
This is the signal that you
see--that you've seen on screens

00:42:43.556 --> 00:42:48.150
by patients beds in countless
movies and television shows.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:51.007
What do these represent?
Well, they're called by letters

00:42:51.007 --> 00:42:53.477
of the alphabet.
This one's called the P wave

00:42:53.477 --> 00:42:56.473
that represents the activity
caused during atrial

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:58.876
contraction,
so all of those currents that

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:01.960
are generated during atrial
contraction show up as a P wave.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.961
The QRS complex,
this very big signal here,

00:43:05.961 --> 00:43:09.199
is contraction of the
ventricle.

00:43:09.199 --> 00:43:13.828
What does this represent here,
the distance between the P wave

00:43:13.828 --> 00:43:17.027
and the QRS wave?
This represents the delay in

00:43:17.027 --> 00:43:19.599
signal transmitting through the
AV node.

00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:24.463
If your AV node was not
functioning you'd expect that to

00:43:24.463 --> 00:43:29.438
shorten, that lag would shorten.
You'd also expect that your

00:43:29.438 --> 00:43:34.030
cardiac performance would not be
so good, because you don't have

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:38.477
this delay then the ventricle is
contracting before it's fully

00:43:38.477 --> 00:43:41.320
filled by the atrial
contractions.

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.659
You can diagnose that
problem, somebody comes in,

00:43:43.659 --> 00:43:45.909
they're short of breath,
they're having trouble,

00:43:45.909 --> 00:43:48.925
they don't know what it is,
you measure their EKG,

00:43:48.925 --> 00:43:52.434
you see that this is shortened
and you know that there's a

00:43:52.434 --> 00:43:55.450
problem with their cardiac
conduction system,

00:43:55.450 --> 00:44:00.329
in particular, with the AV node.
That's how physicians use these

00:44:00.329 --> 00:44:04.107
tools.
The T wave is re-polarization

00:44:04.107 --> 00:44:08.571
of the ventricles.
This is the return of all of

00:44:08.571 --> 00:44:12.475
this current back into the cell
after this massive

00:44:12.475 --> 00:44:15.813
depolarization.
The U wave, which is only very

00:44:15.813 --> 00:44:19.050
rarely seen, represents
relaxation of the muscles,

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:22.599
the papillary muscles inside,
which control some of the valve

00:44:22.599 --> 00:44:27.462
function.
We'll talk about this more in

00:44:27.462 --> 00:44:30.469
section.
If you've had a full

00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:34.789
electrocardiogram you'll know
that they put many electrodes on

00:44:34.789 --> 00:44:36.647
your body.
They put--a full

00:44:36.647 --> 00:44:40.338
electrocardiograph would take 12
electrodes and some of them are

00:44:40.338 --> 00:44:43.795
placed on your limbs and some of
them are placed around your

00:44:43.795 --> 00:44:45.588
chest,
sort of wrapped around your

00:44:45.588 --> 00:44:48.309
chest in a fashion.
The reason for doing that is

00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:52.449
that you can--if you put several
electrodes then you could look

00:44:52.449 --> 00:44:56.256
at the potential difference
that's generated by looking at

00:44:56.256 --> 00:44:59.866
any two of those electrodes.
If I have one up here and one

00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:02.340
up here and I look at the
voltage difference here,

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:05.763
it might not be the same as the
voltage difference measured

00:45:05.763 --> 00:45:08.610
between here and here.
Why is that?

00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:11.551
Because your heart is oriented
in space, it's a three

00:45:11.551 --> 00:45:14.075
dimensional object.
All of these cells are at

00:45:14.075 --> 00:45:17.014
particular three-dimensional
positions inside this three

00:45:17.014 --> 00:45:20.671
dimensional object.
As these currents happen they

00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:24.179
happen in a very spatially
oriented way.

00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:28.052
So, the potential difference I
measure at a distance,

00:45:28.052 --> 00:45:31.179
here and here for example,
is different.

00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:34.215
It's sort of like looking
at the heart from different

00:45:34.215 --> 00:45:36.384
vantage points,
looking at the electrical

00:45:36.384 --> 00:45:39.420
activity of the heart from
different vantage points.

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.480
One of the things that
cardiologists have learned how

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.541
to do is how to look at
potentials that are generated

00:45:45.541 --> 00:45:47.719
from different spatial
locations,

00:45:47.719 --> 00:45:51.463
and correlate that with things
that are happening over the

00:45:51.463 --> 00:45:54.782
complex geography of the heart.
Why do you have more than one

00:45:54.782 --> 00:45:56.494
electrode?
It's so you can look at the

00:45:56.494 --> 00:45:58.240
heart from sort of different
angles.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:08.000
Questions?
Good, see you on Thursday.

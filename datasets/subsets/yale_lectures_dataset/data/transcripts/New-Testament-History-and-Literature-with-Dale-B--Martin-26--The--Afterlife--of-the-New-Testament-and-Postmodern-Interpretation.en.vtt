00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.320
Prof: Okay,
last lecture of the semester.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.310
We're going to talk about the
big question,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.420
how did this little group of
Jews following a prophet,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.670
an apocalyptic prophet,
around Galilee,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.670
who was then executed shortly
thereafter in Jerusalem,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.770
become what we now call a major
world religion.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.310
How did that happen?
 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.544
Because the whole first hundred
years we've talked about in this

00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:30.650
class of what we now call
Christianity.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.923
Of course it's not even called
"Christianity"

00:00:32.923 --> 00:00:34.270
until the letters of Ignatius.
 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.911
There's no term
"Christianity"

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.300
in the Bible itself,
and as I've said,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.548
the Apostle Paul certainly did
not use the term

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:42.770
"Christian."
 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.253
He probably would have rejected
it because that would imply that

00:00:46.253 --> 00:00:49.127
he was doing something else
besides just bringing the

00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:50.510
Gentiles into Israel.
 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.210
He thought he was continuing
Israel, not making another

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.760
religion.
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.033
How did this rag tag bunch of
people following Jesus,

00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.747
and then these different house
churches become what's called

00:01:00.747 --> 00:01:02.700
now a major world religion?
 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.013
We'll talk a bit about that
today, and then I'm going to

00:01:06.013 --> 00:01:09.385
talk in the class with a little
bit of stuff on theory of

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:12.700
interpretation that we've hit on
over the semester.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.268
I should also remind you that
at the end of the class we'll be

00:01:16.268 --> 00:01:19.310
passing out the instructions for
your final exams.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.417
I'll leave about ten minutes or
so of time for us to talk about

00:01:22.417 --> 00:01:25.424
that so you'll have plenty of
time to ask questions about the

00:01:25.424 --> 00:01:27.680
final exam once you get the
instructions.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.087
Finally, since this is your
last chance, be sure and stick

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:36.959
up your hand if you want to ask
a question or make a comment.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.560
This is time if you want to
throw things and rebel against

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.610
the course.
 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.700
This is probably the best time
to do it, it's your last chance.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.129
So ask any questions you want
also about any of these topics,

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:49.730
and we'll talk about that.
 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.702
From the teachings of Jesus to
the gospel about Jesus,

00:01:53.702 --> 00:01:57.150
that's one of the first things
that happens.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.790
We've already seen that going
on.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.313
The historical Jesus,
and if you really have not had

00:02:01.313 --> 00:02:04.530
enough of this and you want to
take a historical Jesus course,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.322
I'm going to be teaching a
seminar for undergraduates on

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:09.150
the historical Jesus in the
fall,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.034
open to anybody,
and we'll have a full semester

00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:15.485
to deal with these problems of
the historical Jesus in a

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:16.740
seminar setting.
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.655
The historical Jesus did not
talk about himself as the

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:21.318
Christ.
 

00:02:21.318 --> 00:02:24.127
We just don't have him doing
that except in the Gospel of

00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:24.479
John.
 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.484
It may well have been that he
thought he was the Messiah or

00:02:27.484 --> 00:02:29.348
that he was preceding the
Messiah.

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.595
Somebody must have thought that
he was a Messianic figure

00:02:31.595 --> 00:02:33.598
because that's what the Romans
executed him for.

00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:36.432
Either he may have thought he
was the Messiah or some of his

00:02:36.432 --> 00:02:38.930
disciples may have hoped that he
was the Messiah,

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.538
but he didn't go around
preaching about himself.

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:45.608
The topic that Jesus talks
about the most in the Synoptic

00:02:45.608 --> 00:02:47.910
Gospels is actually the kingdom
of God,

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.520
this thing that was expected to
happen in the future.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.718
The historical Jesus first is
talking about some gospel that

00:02:54.718 --> 00:02:58.634
it's good news but it's about
this coming kingdom of God

00:02:58.634 --> 00:03:01.378
that's going to--
when God's going to break in.

00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:04.949
Very quickly after his death,
as we see already by the

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:07.388
letters of Paul,
the earliest material in the

00:03:07.388 --> 00:03:09.575
New Testament,
the gospel of Jesus,

00:03:09.575 --> 00:03:14.080
the good news he proclaimed
became the gospel about Jesus.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.470
In other words,
the good news was who was this

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.490
man, and what does that mean for
us?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.613
That's the first major change
that happens in early

00:03:21.613 --> 00:03:24.800
Christianity on the way to
becoming Christianity.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.288
You've seen the growth of the
Pauline churches,

00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:30.168
so the first thing that happens
is it moves out of Palestine and

00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.910
it moves throughout the Greek
speaking world in the west,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.699
and very early,
we don't know by whom,

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:39.264
a church was planted in Rome
because it's already there by

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:41.580
the time Paul writes to the
Romans.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.080
It's been there for years.
 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.577
We've seen how there's a
diversity of early Christian

00:03:45.577 --> 00:03:46.008
groups.
 

00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:50.018
In fact your final exam will
require you to choose one of two

00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:50.818
questions.
 

00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:53.120
It will require you to address
this issue that we've been

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.419
hitting on all semester long
about how diverse this early

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.008
movement was,
what did different groups look

00:03:58.008 --> 00:03:58.378
like?
 

00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:01.860
We've also talked in the last
lecture about how did some of

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.818
the institutions of the church
start gradually being developed,

00:04:05.818 --> 00:04:08.310
such as having a bishop,
having priests,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.284
having deacons,
and then the establishment of

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:15.478
the Lord's Supper as a piece of
liturgy and ritual that becomes

00:04:15.478 --> 00:04:18.860
celebrated throughout these
different groups,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.471
the practice of baptism being
pretty much universally

00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:23.528
practiced by these groups very
quickly.

00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:26.865
We also have seen part of the
beginning of the rise of

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.250
Christian scripture.
 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.160
We've not gotten to the Canon
in this course,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.949
the actual development of the
Canon,

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.899
because that doesn't happen
until the fourth,

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.915
fifth, and sixth centuries,
when the list of these books

00:04:36.915 --> 00:04:40.259
that become the New Testament
canon become more solidified.

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.589
But we've seen the beginnings
of this.

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:46.870
We've seen how different Gospel
writers will use other Gospels.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.699
We've seen how the writer of 2
Peter will talk about Paul's

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.220
letters as scripture.
 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.045
So we've seen a collection of
Paul's letters coming about,

00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:57.870
and we've seen the Gospels
coming about as a collection in

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.009
the second century.
 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:02.144
Then one of the major things
we've seen the beginnings of

00:05:02.144 --> 00:05:05.336
that will become more and more
important for the nature of

00:05:05.336 --> 00:05:08.360
Christianity later is its
separation from Judaism.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.028
As I've repeated several times
in this course,

00:05:11.028 --> 00:05:14.055
the earliest people who
followed Jesus never thought

00:05:14.055 --> 00:05:16.310
they were starting a new
religion.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.463
They thought they were simply
continuing the right behavior of

00:05:19.463 --> 00:05:19.980
Judaism.
 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.290
Paul himself thought he was
continuing Judaism.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.692
It's just that he thought he
was bringing non-Jews into it in

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:27.769
a fairly new way.
 

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:31.148
We've seen the beginnings of
how, in the letter to the

00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:34.584
Hebrews,
we've seen the sermon end with

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:38.870
the author making this weird
statement about,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.452
"let us go outside the
camp," as Jesus was

00:05:41.452 --> 00:05:43.579
executed outside the city of
Jerusalem,

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:47.529
and the sacrifices were done in
Exodus outside of the camp,

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.509
so we now as followers of Jesus
should go outside the camp,

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.790
sounding like he's meaning
we're going to leave Judaism,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.190
we have a now superior liturgy.
 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.293
In the second century this
separation of the church from

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:03.172
the synagogue will start
becoming clearer in certain

00:06:03.172 --> 00:06:04.613
places,
and, finally,

00:06:04.613 --> 00:06:07.244
what you'll end up with,
after the fourth,

00:06:07.244 --> 00:06:10.879
fifth, and sixth century is a
Christian church that's not

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.776
Jewish and Rabbinic Judaism that
comes to look more like what

00:06:14.776 --> 00:06:17.439
Judaism has looked since that
time,

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:20.819
even different from the Judaism
as it was in the time of Jesus.

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.399
The second century therefore
sees some important changes.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:27.728
First, as I've said,
Christianity is still

00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:31.384
remarkably diverse even in the
second century,

00:06:31.384 --> 00:06:33.089
and it does grow.
 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:37.497
How quickly it grows
numerically is really impossible

00:06:37.497 --> 00:06:38.259
to say.
 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.680
We don't have the kind of
demographic data to know how

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.617
much numerical growth there was
in the Christian church in the

00:06:45.617 --> 00:06:48.225
second century,
but we can obviously tell it's

00:06:48.225 --> 00:06:49.759
happening in different places
by,

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.519
if nothing more,
an increase in written

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:54.389
literature that comes about in
different geographical locations

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:55.779
during the second century.
 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:59.351
Connections among these
different groups also started

00:06:59.351 --> 00:07:00.040
growing.
 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.067
As I've tried to make clear,
we don't really have any reason

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:07.824
to believe that the churches
that Paul founded were that

00:07:07.824 --> 00:07:11.026
closely connected to,
say, other churches that may

00:07:11.026 --> 00:07:14.500
have existed in Syria,
or in Egypt, or in Italy.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.165
Paul did want his churches to
remain closely connected to the

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:20.776
church in Jerusalem,
and that's precisely why he

00:07:20.776 --> 00:07:23.999
started this collection,
among the predominantly Gentile

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:26.629
churches,
of money to give to the poorer

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:27.959
church in Jerusalem.
 

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.488
Paul already was starting this
connection, and he's writing

00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:33.009
letters back and forth.
 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:35.132
We've seen already that other
churches seem to be writing

00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:36.079
letters back and forth.
 

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:40.033
These connections start coming
a bit more networked in the

00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:41.560
second century also.
 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.553
We've also seen how Christian
churches start,

00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:48.023
in the second century,
imitating Roman political and

00:07:48.023 --> 00:07:49.519
social structures.
 

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.600
They start imitating the Roman
household and their government,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.620
which is having the monarchical
bishop,

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.050
the one ruling bishop over a
town area,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.194
and we call it the monarchical
bishop because the bishop

00:08:00.194 --> 00:08:03.776
becomes like a king,
a monarch, the single bishop

00:08:03.776 --> 00:08:04.829
over a town.
 

00:08:04.829 --> 00:08:08.310
That starts happening in more
places in the second century.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.170
We've already seen it a bit in
the letters of Ignatius;

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.545
it becomes a lot more prevalent
by the time you get to the end

00:08:12.545 --> 00:08:13.480
of the second century.
 

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.220
Jewish Christianity starts
dying out.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.790
In the second century we do
have some Jews who follow Jesus;

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.778
they take Jesus to be the
Messiah.

00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:26.120
Some of the don't seem to
believe Jesus is divine.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.134
They just--they take him to be
a great prophet and maybe even

00:08:29.134 --> 00:08:31.396
the Messiah but not--that
doesn't make him God

00:08:31.396 --> 00:08:32.200
necessarily.
 

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.566
And these Jewish churches are
still there in the second

00:08:35.566 --> 00:08:36.190
century.
 

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.335
We gradually see them become
less and less visible after the

00:08:40.335 --> 00:08:41.529
second century.
 

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:44.417
We've already seen some other
things in the second century

00:08:44.417 --> 00:08:45.428
that are going on.
 

00:08:45.428 --> 00:08:47.049
I've talked in the class about
Gnosticism.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.610
So the Gnostics--there was no
church of the Gnostics,

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.357
there was not a movement that
had a sign and website somewhere

00:09:02.357 --> 00:09:05.057
that said Gnosticism,
but we use the term as an

00:09:05.057 --> 00:09:08.813
umbrella term for Christians who
held onto certain kinds of

00:09:08.813 --> 00:09:11.210
mythological views about
Genesis,

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.528
and angels, and the creation,
and different divine figures.

00:09:14.528 --> 00:09:17.778
That's one thing that becomes
more visible.

00:09:17.778 --> 00:09:21.745
In fact, we believe that most
of the texts that we find in the

00:09:21.745 --> 00:09:24.816
Nag Hammadi Library,
we know that the library itself

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:27.408
seems to have been written in
the fourth century,

00:09:27.408 --> 00:09:29.533
the actual texts,
but we believe that a lot of

00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:31.894
those texts were written
originally in Greek in the

00:09:31.894 --> 00:09:34.636
second century,
and then they were translated

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:37.240
into mostly Coptic by the fourth
century.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.726
This literature,
which modern scholars place

00:09:40.726 --> 00:09:44.048
under the bigger rubric of
Gnosticism,

00:09:44.048 --> 00:09:46.250
starts being written in the
second century with these

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.445
elaborate mythologies,
with different layers of

00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:51.379
heavens, with different angels
or beings ruling those different

00:09:51.379 --> 00:09:53.465
layers,
and different mythologies about

00:09:53.465 --> 00:09:55.840
creation and how the created
world came to be.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:01.328
There is also a very important
figure that some people will

00:10:01.328 --> 00:10:05.019
call Gnostic,
but we now tend not to.

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:08.576
Valentinus was a Christian
scholar who lived in Rome in the

00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:12.341
middle of the second century,
and he gathered around him

00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:15.356
other Christians,
and they indulged in sort of a

00:10:15.356 --> 00:10:18.527
very philosophical way of
thinking about Christianity and

00:10:18.527 --> 00:10:19.320
the Gospel.
 

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.967
They look Gnostic in some ways,
but they don't seem to have a

00:10:22.967 --> 00:10:24.852
belief in two gods,
necessarily,

00:10:24.852 --> 00:10:26.860
that other Gnostic groups do.
 

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.287
Valentinus, though,
represents another kind of

00:10:29.287 --> 00:10:32.740
Christianity that becomes very
visible in the second century,

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.927
and it remains important for a
couple of centuries after that

00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.529
until all these kinds of
Christianity are declared

00:10:38.529 --> 00:10:41.753
heretical later in the fourth,
fifth, and sixth centuries and

00:10:41.753 --> 00:10:42.889
they're run underground.
 

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:46.029
Valentinus is a major figure
because you can see him,

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:49.375
and he's a highly educated--we
don't know a whole lot about him

00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:50.844
historically,
biographically,

00:10:50.844 --> 00:10:53.058
but you can just tell from
pieces of the history that he

00:10:53.058 --> 00:10:54.548
must have been a highly
educated,

00:10:54.548 --> 00:10:57.029
philosophically educated
individual,

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:00.831
who was trying to raise the
mythologies that he found in

00:11:00.831 --> 00:11:04.841
Genesis and in the Bible to a
level of higher philosophical

00:11:04.841 --> 00:11:08.408
platonic speculation,
so that becomes very visible.

00:11:08.408 --> 00:11:09.840
We've already talked also about
Marcion,

00:11:12.259 --> 00:11:15.770
and I've said that a lot of
scholars take it that when

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.678
Marcion came up with his own
Canon of the New Testament,

00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:21.235
his list of the New Testament,
which included the Gospel of

00:11:21.235 --> 00:11:22.886
Luke,
which he edited to take out all

00:11:22.886 --> 00:11:25.668
the Jewish stuff in it that he
thought shouldn't be there,

00:11:25.668 --> 00:11:29.220
and the letters of Paul which
he also edited and just that

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.210
list of things was his sort of
New Testament,

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.509
his Christian Canon,
and he threw out the Hebrew

00:11:34.509 --> 00:11:35.788
Bible,
the Old Testament,

00:11:35.788 --> 00:11:37.139
because that was too Jewish.
 

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:39.874
Marcion also then is being
kicked out of the church in Rome

00:11:39.874 --> 00:11:42.418
and being declared a heretic in
the second century,

00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:45.592
but he founds churches that
exist then for a couple of

00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:49.556
centuries after his death,
especially in the eastern part

00:11:49.556 --> 00:11:50.668
of the empire.
 

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:54.912
These are all different kinds
of Christianity that are really

00:11:54.912 --> 00:11:57.668
boiling up in the second century
as--

00:11:57.668 --> 00:12:00.676
churches are trying to figure
out what does it mean to be

00:12:00.676 --> 00:12:03.200
Christian but not necessarily
Jewish anymore.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.908
One of the other figures that
we haven't talked about is

00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:06.450
Montanus.
 

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.043
This was a prophet who went
around declaring that he had a

00:12:14.043 --> 00:12:17.616
special gift of the Holy Spirit,
maybe even that he was the Holy

00:12:17.616 --> 00:12:19.543
Spirit,
there were two women who also

00:12:19.543 --> 00:12:21.941
followed him,
and they all claimed to have

00:12:21.941 --> 00:12:25.341
prophetic gifts and to be able
to have the Holy Spirit and God

00:12:25.341 --> 00:12:27.070
speak directly through them.
 

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.583
They developed quite a
following, they were very

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:32.044
ascetic, very strict,
so they forbade marriage,

00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:33.649
and these sorts of things.
 

00:12:33.649 --> 00:12:38.267
So they were practicing a
certain kind of early asceticism

00:12:38.267 --> 00:12:43.126
and monasticism but with this
very strong prophetic stream of

00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:44.100
it also.
 

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.514
They were very active in the
second century also,

00:12:46.514 --> 00:12:49.380
and then people like Augustine
would later have to sort of

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:50.788
fight with these people.
 

00:12:50.788 --> 00:12:53.883
You also have in the second
century the first people that we

00:12:53.883 --> 00:12:56.190
really can say are Christian
philosophers.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:13:00.570
You could say that Paul had a
rhetorical education.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.864
Every once in a while you can
see stuff in Paul's letters that

00:13:03.864 --> 00:13:06.565
looks a bit like what you'll see
in say philosophy,

00:13:06.565 --> 00:13:07.700
stoicism perhaps.
 

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.230
A friend of mind,
Troels Engberg-Pederson,

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:13.759
a professor at the University
of Copenhagen in Denmark,

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:17.306
has written a lot trying to
prove that Paul's ideas are

00:13:17.306 --> 00:13:20.917
heavily Stoic and probably
deeply influenced by Stoicism

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:21.639
itself.
 

00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:24.684
Most of us don't buy that,
but we think you might see

00:13:24.684 --> 00:13:26.970
traces of Stoicism in Paul's
writing.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.768
You might say that you see
traces of Platonism in,

00:13:29.768 --> 00:13:32.908
say, the letter of Hebrews,
or in the Gospel of John.

00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:35.610
But you don't find any New
Testament writing that looks

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.658
like it would have come out of a
real philosophical school.

00:13:38.658 --> 00:13:42.230
It doesn't have that high level
of philosophical speculation or

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.668
knowledge that we have.
 

00:13:43.668 --> 00:13:45.470
In the second century,
we do have,

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.631
though, some individuals
arising who style themselves as

00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:53.457
Christian philosophers,
and they style Christianity as

00:13:53.457 --> 00:13:54.759
itself a philosophy.
 

00:13:54.759 --> 00:13:56.690
One of the most famous is
Justin Martyr.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:02.299
"Martyr"
of course is not his last name,

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:04.370
and it's not like Justin
H.***Martyr.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:08.679
Martyr is his nickname because
he was martyred around the year

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:09.668
150 in Rome.
 

00:14:09.668 --> 00:14:12.184
Justin claims,
and we have several writings of

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.756
him that survived,
along with an account of his

00:14:14.756 --> 00:14:15.538
martyrdom.
 

00:14:15.538 --> 00:14:18.653
Justin claims that he shopped
around when he was a young man

00:14:18.653 --> 00:14:21.186
in all the different
philosophies and he couldn't

00:14:21.186 --> 00:14:23.982
find any that really satisfied
him until he found this

00:14:23.982 --> 00:14:25.250
Christian teacher.
 

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.850
And he attached himself to that
Christian teacher,

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:30.557
and that teacher introduced him
to the philosophy of

00:14:30.557 --> 00:14:31.460
Christianity.
 

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.191
You have a person who goes
around in robes,

00:14:34.191 --> 00:14:37.768
he grows his beard long,
he carries scrolls around so he

00:14:37.768 --> 00:14:39.850
can look like a philosopher.
 

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.370
At his trial,
when he's being condemned,

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.328
he defends himself as a
philosopher like philosophers

00:14:45.328 --> 00:14:48.744
that had to defend themselves
against Roman emperors often in

00:14:48.744 --> 00:14:50.110
the first centuries.
 

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.121
Justin Martyr is one of the
first truly sort of

00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:54.889
philosophical Christians.
 

00:14:54.889 --> 00:15:02.543
Another that existed a little
bit later than this is Clement

00:15:02.543 --> 00:15:04.620
of Alexandria.
 

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:07.916
He was probably head of a
catechetical school,

00:15:07.916 --> 00:15:11.139
a Christian school in
Alexandria in Egypt.

00:15:11.139 --> 00:15:14.008
He wrote toward the end of the
second century,

00:15:14.008 --> 00:15:16.940
so around the year 200 is when
he's writing.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.812
And Clement also clearly has a
very good philosophical

00:15:20.812 --> 00:15:21.690
education.
 

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.100
His writing is excellent,
he tries to make Christianity--

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.719
for example he downplays
apocalyptic kinds of stuff in

00:15:28.719 --> 00:15:31.240
Christianity because he knows
that doesn't look very

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.129
philosophical.
 

00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:35.259
He downplays the emphasis on
poverty,

00:15:35.259 --> 00:15:38.501
and there are lots of parts in
the New Testament that basically

00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:41.168
teach that if you're rich you
won't go to heaven.

00:15:41.168 --> 00:15:44.205
Remember how the letter of
James basically seems to condemn

00:15:44.205 --> 00:15:47.296
rich people just out of hand,
not just rich people when

00:15:47.296 --> 00:15:49.960
they're evil and not using their
money badly,

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.916
but just by being rich itself,
you're condemned in some early

00:15:52.916 --> 00:15:54.000
Christian documents.
 

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.668
Clement writes against that
kind of stuff.

00:15:55.668 --> 00:15:59.311
He writes stuff showing how you
can be a rich person and enjoy

00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:01.700
nice things, and still be a
Christian.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.250
So he's writing at the end of
the second century,

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.490
again, making Christianity into
something that looks much more

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:08.658
like a philosophy.
 

00:16:08.658 --> 00:16:11.437
These things are going on in
the second century and that's

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.264
going to change Christianity to
a great extent because what

00:16:14.264 --> 00:16:16.750
becomes traditional orthodox
Christianity is heavily

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:19.798
influenced by philosophy,
especially by the Platonism

00:16:19.798 --> 00:16:21.620
that's around in late antiquity.
 

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:23.120
The very notion,
for example,

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.445
of the immortality of the soul
that you get in a lot of popular

00:16:26.445 --> 00:16:28.601
Christianity,
it comes from Platonism more

00:16:28.601 --> 00:16:30.690
than it does from anything in
the New Testament.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:34.106
The other development that's
going on at this time that will

00:16:34.106 --> 00:16:36.250
become very important is
martyrdom.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.414
I've talked about that last
time, and of course Justin

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:40.048
Martyr is one of the examples of
this.

00:16:40.048 --> 00:16:45.807
So there's no general empire
wide persecution of Christians

00:16:45.807 --> 00:16:50.015
in the second century,
but you do have sporadic

00:16:50.015 --> 00:16:54.190
persecutions arising against
Christians in certain areas.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.125
In Rome, at certain times,
you will have certain people

00:16:57.125 --> 00:16:59.952
martyred, usually leaders,
or bishops, or people like

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:02.019
Justin Martyr who are key
figures.

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:04.701
Martyrdom, therefore,
starts developing its own

00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:07.910
ideology and its own theology in
the second century,

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.367
which will become very
important for later monasticism

00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:12.920
and the how Christianity
develops in the Middle Ages.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.008
You have this idea I've talked
about last time,

00:17:15.008 --> 00:17:16.960
that martyrs are especially
close to God.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.182
Martyrs go straight to heaven,
they don't have to go paradise

00:17:21.182 --> 00:17:24.913
or any place else first,
they go straight to heaven on

00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:26.108
being killed.
 

00:17:26.108 --> 00:17:28.295
Confessors, that is,
people who are condemned to

00:17:28.295 --> 00:17:30.933
martyrdom but not martyred,
also become especially

00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:34.440
important, as figures who are
considered to be closer to God.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.493
These attacks on Christianity
and the way Christians respond

00:17:38.493 --> 00:17:42.884
to it with this sort of martial,
almost warlike ideology of

00:17:42.884 --> 00:17:45.297
martyrdom--
the martyr becomes a soldier in

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:48.390
the army of God in the way it's
depicted in the second century.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:55.839
This is even picked up by
enemies of Christianity.

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:58.630
Galen was a very famous doctor.
 

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.228
Galen was the most famous
medical writer of antiquity and

00:18:07.228 --> 00:18:10.910
tons and tons of his medical
writings still survive,

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:13.220
and it takes forever to read
through them,

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.836
even in an English translation
much less in Greek and now in

00:18:15.836 --> 00:18:17.390
Arabic translation that
survived.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:20.671
Galen actually mentions Jews
and Christians in a few places

00:18:20.671 --> 00:18:21.690
in his writings.
 

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:23.761
One of the things he says is
that he thinks Christians are

00:18:23.761 --> 00:18:24.088
stupid.
 

00:18:24.088 --> 00:18:26.689
He thinks they're crazy because
they believe in a God who gets

00:18:26.689 --> 00:18:27.029
angry.
 

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:28.298
God doesn't get angry!
 

00:18:28.298 --> 00:18:29.890
That goes against the very
definition of God.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.527
He believes that Christians are
superstitious,

00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:33.288
uneducated.
 

00:18:33.288 --> 00:18:36.930
He thinks that it probably only
succeeds with the gullible.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.252
But he still admires Christians
because of the way they face

00:18:41.252 --> 00:18:41.838
death.
 

00:18:41.838 --> 00:18:45.426
Even Christians' enemies
recognize that they had a

00:18:45.426 --> 00:18:49.747
certain bravery and courage in
being totally willing to face

00:18:49.747 --> 00:18:50.480
death.
 

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.910
Celsus was a contemporary,
also living in the middle of

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.622
the second century,
he wrote against Christianity

00:18:55.622 --> 00:18:57.759
also and wrote against
Christians,

00:18:57.759 --> 00:19:01.211
and he will admit,
though, that they seem to have

00:19:01.211 --> 00:19:02.650
a certain bravery.
 

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.623
He just says they're foolhardy
in being willing to throw

00:19:05.623 --> 00:19:07.838
themselves on a sword the way
they do,

00:19:07.838 --> 00:19:10.728
and throw themselves to the
beasts as we've seen Ignatius do

00:19:10.728 --> 00:19:13.390
in his letters,
let the beasts come to me.

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:16.904
So Celsus and Galen admire
Christians for the courage and

00:19:16.904 --> 00:19:20.422
the almost military discipline
they have even though they

00:19:20.422 --> 00:19:23.092
despise them for being,
they believe,

00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:25.480
gullible, superstitious
bumpkins.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:28.630
So you have for the first time
in the second century,

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:32.015
also then, educated
non-Christians taking notice of

00:19:32.015 --> 00:19:36.348
the movement and writing about
it and having an idea about it.

00:19:36.348 --> 00:19:40.330
Then in response to this kind
of thing you have the beginning

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:42.953
of apologists,
people like Justin Martyr

00:19:42.953 --> 00:19:46.362
himself, who wrote an apology
for Christianity against its

00:19:46.362 --> 00:19:47.200
detractors.
 

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:50.412
Either against the governmental
type detractors who said it was

00:19:50.412 --> 00:19:53.470
seditious because it wasn't
loyal enough to the emperor,

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.009
or philosophical detractors who
said it was superstition,

00:19:57.009 --> 00:20:00.419
and Celsus famously said,
the only people these people

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:03.690
can convince are old women,
and slaves and kids.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.838
No educated man would fall for
all this bunk.

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:10.029
You have Christian apologists,
therefore, writing apologies in

00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:12.539
the second century,
trying to defend Christianity

00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:13.900
against these attacks.
 

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.028
All of that's already in the
second century,

00:20:17.028 --> 00:20:20.271
one hundred years after Jesus,
this little Palestinian

00:20:20.271 --> 00:20:23.636
movement is turning into
something that's going to start

00:20:23.636 --> 00:20:25.839
looking more recognizable to us.
 

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:27.230
But it still takes a long time.
 

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.781
In the third century you have
developments that are very

00:20:29.781 --> 00:20:30.338
important.
 

00:20:30.338 --> 00:20:33.368
You have the real rise of
monasticism.

00:20:33.368 --> 00:20:36.893
Now all the way through the
beginning of Christianity we've

00:20:36.893 --> 00:20:39.868
seen that some Christians
practiced asceticism.

00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:42.455
You know the word asceticism
just comes from the Greek word

00:20:42.455 --> 00:20:43.660
for "exercise."
 

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:50.394
It's come to mean any sort of
self-discipline for a higher

00:20:50.394 --> 00:20:55.703
good: the avoidance of sex,
the avoidance of food,

00:20:55.703 --> 00:20:58.718
as much as possible,
the avoidance of wine,

00:20:58.718 --> 00:20:59.910
drinking only water.
 

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.256
So different groups in the
ancient world including some

00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:05.724
Jewish groups will be called,
for example,

00:21:05.724 --> 00:21:08.028
"water drinkers"
because they will avoid wine.

00:21:08.028 --> 00:21:11.513
It's not because they felt like
these things were in themselves

00:21:11.513 --> 00:21:12.019
sinful.
 

00:21:12.019 --> 00:21:15.361
It's that they were using these
deprivations of pleasures in

00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:17.910
order to train the body and
train the soul.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:21.130
Again, they were borrowing from
Roman military imagery and

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:22.259
military ideology.
 

00:21:22.259 --> 00:21:22.470
St.
 

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.971
Anthony becomes famous,
he's not necessarily but he

00:21:25.971 --> 00:21:30.246
gets the reputation later for
being the first one to go out in

00:21:30.246 --> 00:21:35.009
the desert and live totally by
himself and discipline his body.

00:21:35.009 --> 00:21:37.180
He gets attacked by demons all
the time.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.577
Demons are always going out to
the desert to find him,

00:21:39.577 --> 00:21:42.066
and disguising themselves as
young lovely girls or boys,

00:21:42.066 --> 00:21:43.558
and trying to seduce Anthony.
 

00:21:43.558 --> 00:21:45.329
And so he has to fight these
demons all alone out in the

00:21:45.329 --> 00:21:46.490
desert in the middle of the
night.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.618
How do you fight demons like
that?

00:21:48.618 --> 00:21:50.660
Well, you buffet your body,
you buffet your soul,

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.019
and you make your will strong.
 

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:52.940
How do you do that?
 

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:54.977
You avoid sex,
you avoid desire,

00:21:54.977 --> 00:21:57.662
you avoid rich food,
you avoid wine,

00:21:57.662 --> 00:22:01.180
so training the body and
training the will,

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.145
like a soldier or an athlete,
they use both these athletic

00:22:04.145 --> 00:22:07.900
imagery and soldier imagery,
to describe the training.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.273
This all becomes a highly
elaborated ideology and theology

00:22:12.273 --> 00:22:14.730
starting in the third century.
 

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.954
You have not only groups of
monks and sometimes nuns living

00:22:18.954 --> 00:22:24.486
together,
that's one kind of monasticism

00:22:24.486 --> 00:22:29.034
we call cenobitic,
koinonia, monasticism,

00:22:29.034 --> 00:22:32.278
that is monks or nuns living--
not monks and nuns living

00:22:32.278 --> 00:22:34.259
together,
although that seldom happened

00:22:34.259 --> 00:22:36.344
but sometimes did--
but usually monks living

00:22:36.344 --> 00:22:37.880
together or nuns living
together.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.082
Then you have with this
movement, like I said with

00:22:41.082 --> 00:22:45.265
Anthony, of some monks going off
into the desert and living alone

00:22:45.265 --> 00:22:47.029
and that sort of thing.
 

00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:49.734
You have both these forms of
monasticism starting to develop

00:22:49.734 --> 00:22:50.788
in the third century.
 

00:22:50.788 --> 00:22:53.608
This will become hugely
important, as you know,

00:22:53.608 --> 00:22:56.980
for Christianity all the way
through the Middle Ages.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.490
You couldn't have had Europe,
as we think about Europe.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:03.996
You couldn't have the learning,
the vast learning and the

00:23:03.996 --> 00:23:06.214
texts,
and the classical stuff,

00:23:06.214 --> 00:23:10.173
all the classical texts,
the passing on of literature

00:23:10.173 --> 00:23:12.798
and in philosophy from
antiquity;

00:23:12.798 --> 00:23:15.707
you couldn't have had any of
that without monasticism through

00:23:15.707 --> 00:23:16.578
the Middle Ages.
 

00:23:16.578 --> 00:23:19.445
That begins in the third
century when you have these

00:23:19.445 --> 00:23:22.256
movements really taking off,
and they become hugely

00:23:22.256 --> 00:23:24.730
important and hugely popular for
people.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.471
You also have in the third
century the first really empire

00:23:28.471 --> 00:23:30.640
wide persecution of the church.
 

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.490
An attempt to actually destroy
it and get people to de-convert

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.529
and to denounce Christianity and
to sacrifice to the emperor,

00:23:38.529 --> 00:23:42.450
and this happens with the
Emperor Decius,

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:47.368
so we call this the Decian
Persecution.

00:23:47.368 --> 00:23:50.477
It happens around the time the
year 250, so right in the middle

00:23:50.477 --> 00:23:51.630
of the third century.
 

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:56.596
And this is the first time that
there is an empire wide attempt

00:23:56.596 --> 00:23:59.400
to suppress the Christian
church.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:06.839
Also in the third century you
have one of the most brilliant

00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:13.902
and famous Christian scholars of
all of history actually,

00:24:13.902 --> 00:24:15.288
Origen.
 

00:24:15.288 --> 00:24:18.700
Origen was later considered to
be a heretic for some of the

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:22.181
teachings that he came up with--
for example he taught that even

00:24:22.181 --> 00:24:23.950
Satan could be converted in the
end.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.105
He believed that all created
beings would be brought back up

00:24:28.105 --> 00:24:30.220
somehow into God in the end.
 

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.582
And he had views about the
nature of God and the nature of

00:24:34.582 --> 00:24:39.250
human beings that later would be
deeply suspected of being not

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:41.240
quite orthodox enough.
 

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.926
In his own day,
though, in the third century,

00:24:42.926 --> 00:24:44.038
he was completely orthodox.
 

00:24:44.038 --> 00:24:48.240
He had actually been trained in
probably the catechetical school

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.105
in Alexandria that I mentioned
before that Clement probably

00:24:52.105 --> 00:24:53.038
headed up.
 

00:24:53.038 --> 00:24:55.192
He started his own school,
then, in Palestine,

00:24:55.192 --> 00:24:58.160
and that's where he spent the
rest of his life in Palestine.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.450
Origen was a great biblical
commentator.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.368
He was the first one,
for example,

00:25:03.368 --> 00:25:07.098
who took all the different
versions of the Old Testament,

00:25:07.098 --> 00:25:08.833
for example,
the Hebrew of it,

00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:11.107
the Septuagint,
which was the most famous Greek

00:25:11.107 --> 00:25:13.559
translation,
but then parts of other Greek

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:16.460
translations like by Theodosian
or Aquila,

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.410
and he would put these in
parallel columns.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.748
This was a remarkable sort of
technology for studying the

00:25:21.748 --> 00:25:25.384
Bible: to be able to have all
these things in parallel columns

00:25:25.384 --> 00:25:27.710
to be able to compare side by
side.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.628
He did that sort of thing;
it's called the Hexapla because

00:25:30.628 --> 00:25:32.640
it had six columns of the Old
Testament.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.982
He wrote reams and reams of
commentaries on different books

00:25:35.982 --> 00:25:38.346
of the Bible,
most of which don't survive,

00:25:38.346 --> 00:25:40.480
but we do have quite a bit of
it.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.946
Origen practiced this way of
interpreting scripture I had

00:25:43.946 --> 00:25:46.920
illustrated for you from the
medieval period,

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.420
that scripture always has more
than one level of meaning.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.892
In fact, you remember you read
some Origen's commentary when

00:25:52.892 --> 00:25:55.113
you read that chapter from my
book, Pedagogy of the

00:25:55.113 --> 00:25:55.700
Bible.
 

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.682
Origen represents,
in the third century,

00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:03.425
a new very, very strong rise in
the level of Christian biblical

00:26:03.425 --> 00:26:04.650
scholarship.
 

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.221
He's also very philosophically
educated, so he's part of that

00:26:08.221 --> 00:26:08.578
too.
 

00:26:08.578 --> 00:26:12.259
The tradition of commentary and
high level of Christian

00:26:12.259 --> 00:26:15.938
scholarship also becomes much
more visible in the third

00:26:15.938 --> 00:26:19.707
century than it had been before,
especially through people like

00:26:19.707 --> 00:26:20.038
Origen.
 

00:26:20.038 --> 00:26:24.422
The fourth century,
then, brings us to basically

00:26:24.422 --> 00:26:29.029
where I'm going to stop,
because it's in the fourth

00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:33.048
century that you have the
triumph of Constantine.

00:26:33.048 --> 00:26:36.150
He beats all the rivals to the
throne.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.161
The Roman Empire,
by this time,

00:26:38.161 --> 00:26:41.109
by the year 300,
has been divided up into two

00:26:41.109 --> 00:26:44.529
different basic empires,
the west and the east.

00:26:44.529 --> 00:26:47.951
There was an emperor for each
one and then there was also a

00:26:47.951 --> 00:26:50.782
Caesar for each one,
so there are four rulers who

00:26:50.782 --> 00:26:53.318
ruled the Roman Empire in the
year 300.

00:26:53.318 --> 00:26:55.250
Two emperors,
one in the west and one in the

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:57.585
east, and two Caesars,
one in the west and one in the

00:26:57.585 --> 00:26:57.990
east.
 

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:03.520
Constantine went to war with
the other guy on the other side,

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.720
and he won.
 

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.029
He was actually in the west in
the beginning.

00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.788
He won.
 

00:27:06.788 --> 00:27:10.259
He reunited the empire,
east and west.

00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:12.490
He built his new Rome.
 

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:14.880
He didn't take Rome anymore as
the capital.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.759
He moved the capital to
Constantinople,

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:18.990
named after him of course,
the city of Constantine,

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.069
what we call Istanbul,
or Byzantium was its ancient

00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:24.048
name also.
 

00:27:24.048 --> 00:27:27.159
This is basically where we
start talking about the

00:27:27.159 --> 00:27:30.522
beginning of Byzantine
Christianity because it's named

00:27:30.522 --> 00:27:33.569
after the town Byzantium or
Constantinople,

00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:34.640
or Istanbul.
 

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.938
That becomes the capital of the
Roman Empire that goes on for

00:27:38.938 --> 00:27:39.440
them.
 

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.787
Constantine also wanted to stop
all this feuding about what was

00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:45.470
orthodox Christianity.
 

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:48.965
So he uses the power of the
emperor's throne to force

00:27:48.965 --> 00:27:52.798
bishops to come together in
several different councils.

00:27:52.798 --> 00:27:58.133
The most famous of which,
in 325, is the council of

00:27:58.133 --> 00:28:01.492
Nicaea,
and of course this is where we

00:28:01.492 --> 00:28:05.790
get the term the Nicene Creed,
which if you're Roman Catholic

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.308
or Episcopalian or several other
kinds of Christianity,

00:28:09.308 --> 00:28:12.936
you may recite the Nicene Creed
on certain holy days or in

00:28:12.936 --> 00:28:13.509
church.
 

00:28:13.509 --> 00:28:16.544
This is the longer creed,
which talks about Jesus being

00:28:16.544 --> 00:28:17.950
fully man, fully human.
 

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.151
It brings in the Trinity,
so you have Trinitarian

00:28:21.151 --> 00:28:24.885
theology becoming a bit more
solidified at the council of

00:28:24.885 --> 00:28:25.618
Nicaea.
 

00:28:25.618 --> 00:28:28.223
It didn't win the day because
throughout the fourth century

00:28:28.223 --> 00:28:30.199
you still had fights among
different bishops,

00:28:30.199 --> 00:28:32.308
some people not accepting the
Nicene Creed.

00:28:32.308 --> 00:28:36.017
Years later you had another
creed pronounced at Chalcedon,

00:28:36.017 --> 00:28:38.750
so that's called the
Chalcedonian Creed.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.308
And all of these were attempts
though promoted by the emperors.

00:28:42.308 --> 00:28:45.778
The emperors wanted to use
Christianity to solidify a one

00:28:45.778 --> 00:28:48.690
empire again and to keep it from
being split.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.288
You couldn't do that if you had
different groups claiming to

00:28:51.288 --> 00:28:53.885
represent the right Christianity
and claiming that everybody

00:28:53.885 --> 00:28:55.558
represents the wrong
Christianity.

00:28:55.558 --> 00:28:59.374
That was the real push for what
counts as orthodox Christianity

00:28:59.374 --> 00:29:02.390
and the bringing of more unity
to Christianity.

00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:06.409
What we have not seen in this
semester is what you would call

00:29:06.409 --> 00:29:09.692
correct Trinitarian doctrine in
the New Testament,

00:29:09.692 --> 00:29:11.298
it's just not there.
 

00:29:11.298 --> 00:29:14.240
You've got all kinds of views
about Jesus that would later be

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.269
declared heretical.
 

00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:16.470
They're still there in the New
Testament,

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.662
and what Christians do is that
we just read kind of carefully

00:29:19.662 --> 00:29:22.907
and interpret it a little bit
slickly so that it makes it look

00:29:22.907 --> 00:29:24.930
more orthodox than it actually
is.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.334
That's because there was no
orthodoxy that could claim to

00:29:28.334 --> 00:29:31.798
rule different Christians who
called themselves Christians

00:29:31.798 --> 00:29:33.380
throughout the empire.
 

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.299
This is what starts changing in
the fourth century.

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:36.930
Like I said, they don't succeed.
 

00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:40.040
So you have debates about
orthodoxy for centuries,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.532
but it's with Constantine in
the beginning of the fourth

00:29:43.532 --> 00:29:46.009
century, and he had a long
dynasty.

00:29:46.009 --> 00:29:49.587
His progeny,
his sons, and then their sons,

00:29:49.587 --> 00:29:54.529
and their sons retained the
throne for years after that.

00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:58.114
So you had this Constantinian
dynasty that was able to bring a

00:29:58.114 --> 00:30:01.229
good bit of solidity to the
Roman Empire in the fourth

00:30:01.229 --> 00:30:04.519
century that it hadn't enjoyed
in the third century.

00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:06.752
And therefore,
they used this to sort of bring

00:30:06.752 --> 00:30:09.980
about orthodox Christianity as
the single form of Christianity.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.566
That's the most important
change, therefore,

00:30:12.566 --> 00:30:14.068
for the fourth century.
 

00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:19.568
After that, of course,
as you know from your history,

00:30:19.568 --> 00:30:22.318
the empire splits again.
 

00:30:22.318 --> 00:30:25.009
Later you have this split
between eastern Christianity,

00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:27.828
which is represented by those
churches we call Orthodox,

00:30:27.828 --> 00:30:31.736
located mainly with the
authority of the Greek Orthodox

00:30:31.736 --> 00:30:33.898
church,
but of course you have Orthodox

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:35.990
churches in each of the nations
of the east.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.910
So you have Russian Orthodoxy,
Greek Orthodoxy,

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:41.151
Syrian Orthodoxy,
and you have different Orthodox

00:30:41.151 --> 00:30:45.538
communities in the east and then
Roman Catholicism in the west.

00:30:45.538 --> 00:30:48.230
And that split of course is
still with us.

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:50.990
That starts happening in later
antiquity.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:55.686
But notice it's still not what
anybody would call a world

00:30:55.686 --> 00:30:56.608
religion.
 

00:30:56.608 --> 00:30:58.464
Now the very term "world
religion"

00:30:58.464 --> 00:31:01.269
is something that has only come
about in the twentieth century.

00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:05.105
It was a term that was invented
when Christians were exploring

00:31:05.105 --> 00:31:08.375
around and seeing that there
were other ways of being

00:31:08.375 --> 00:31:10.311
religious,
and how do you want to

00:31:10.311 --> 00:31:11.440
categorize these things?
 

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.578
Around 1900,
some scholars invented this

00:31:13.578 --> 00:31:15.939
concept: well,
there are world religions and

00:31:15.939 --> 00:31:17.858
then there are local religions.
 

00:31:17.858 --> 00:31:20.588
African religion is not a world
religion;

00:31:20.588 --> 00:31:22.595
it's just a certain different
kind of paganism,

00:31:22.595 --> 00:31:23.250
they thought.
 

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.910
They thought that Judaism is
not a world religion.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.404
It's a religion of the Jews,
and by its very definition it's

00:31:30.404 --> 00:31:31.650
an ethnic religion.
 

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.660
Therefore, it's not a religion
that is for anybody in the

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.088
world.
 

00:31:35.088 --> 00:31:37.617
That's why Jews don't go around
missionizing and trying to

00:31:37.617 --> 00:31:40.233
convert everybody in Asia to
Judaism, or everybody in Africa

00:31:40.233 --> 00:31:40.900
to Judaism.
 

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.578
But they said Christianity is
different.

00:31:42.578 --> 00:31:45.401
Christianity believed that it
was the one true religion,

00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:48.326
and therefore launched in the
nineteenth century all these

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:49.660
missionary activities.
 

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.031
It was in the nineteenth
century that you had mainly

00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:54.589
Protestants that in the
nineteenth century really trying

00:31:54.589 --> 00:31:57.241
to convert the whole world to
Christianity and sending out

00:31:57.241 --> 00:31:57.940
missions.
 

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.458
This of course had started in
the beginning in the seventeenth

00:32:00.458 --> 00:32:03.795
century with Roman Catholics,
in North America and South

00:32:03.795 --> 00:32:05.971
America,
trying to convert the Indians

00:32:05.971 --> 00:32:07.470
and trying to set up colonies.
 

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:11.428
The conversion of the Indians
in North America and South

00:32:11.428 --> 00:32:13.882
America,
mainly by Roman Catholics to

00:32:13.882 --> 00:32:16.714
Roman Catholicism,
and then later the attempt in

00:32:16.714 --> 00:32:19.836
the nineteenth century by
Protestant churches to convert

00:32:19.836 --> 00:32:23.241
people all over the world really
does make Christianity start

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:25.568
looking like a worldwide
phenomenon.

00:32:25.568 --> 00:32:28.565
That's not really until the
nineteenth century that that

00:32:28.565 --> 00:32:29.108
happens.
 

00:32:29.108 --> 00:32:31.450
Before that,
Christianity is basically the

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:32.650
religion of Europe.
 

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:36.029
That's why Europeans,
still to this day,

00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:39.372
even if they're not religious,
even if they don't consider

00:32:39.372 --> 00:32:41.712
themselves Christian,
they may consider themselves

00:32:41.712 --> 00:32:44.586
completely atheistic,
but they see Christianity as

00:32:44.586 --> 00:32:48.048
part of the very fabric of
European identity.

00:32:48.048 --> 00:32:51.291
This is what's leading to the
big debate about whether to

00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:53.548
admit Turkey into the European
Union.

00:32:53.548 --> 00:32:55.298
There are a lot of people in
Europe,

00:32:55.298 --> 00:32:57.498
even good liberal people,
who are open minded and don't

00:32:57.498 --> 00:32:59.250
necessarily have anything
against Islam,

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:01.380
who don't want to have Turkey
as part of Europe.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:04.078
One of the main reasons is
because it's not a Christian

00:33:04.078 --> 00:33:04.528
nation.
 

00:33:04.528 --> 00:33:07.057
It doesn't have this--of course
most of their nations aren't

00:33:07.057 --> 00:33:09.670
really Christian in the sense of
having the majority of people

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.758
observing Christianity,
but they still have this idea

00:33:12.758 --> 00:33:16.339
that what it means to be
European is some connection,

00:33:16.339 --> 00:33:17.670
historically, with Christianity.
 

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.631
That's quite true,
because Christianity was not a

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:23.205
world religion;
it existed in Europe until the

00:33:23.205 --> 00:33:23.970
modern period.
 

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:27.503
But with the idea that there
are other world religions,

00:33:27.503 --> 00:33:29.730
that had to do with
colonialism.

00:33:29.730 --> 00:33:32.130
Christianity starts defining
itself as a world religion.

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.095
So the first scholars who
talked about this term said,

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:36.058
well there's only one world
religion, Christianity.

00:33:36.058 --> 00:33:38.515
All the rest are local
religions linked to some

00:33:38.515 --> 00:33:40.170
particular geographical area.
 

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.519
Then they started saying,
well, okay wait a minute,

00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:45.246
they kind of liked Buddhism,
they thought it kind of looked

00:33:45.246 --> 00:33:46.608
a bit like Protestantism.
 

00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:48.710
So they said,
we'll let Buddhism be a world

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.509
religion also.
 

00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:51.934
So for a while around 1900,
the two world religions

00:33:51.934 --> 00:33:54.068
recognized were Christianity and
Buddhism.

00:33:54.068 --> 00:33:55.858
Then gradually they started
saying,

00:33:55.858 --> 00:34:02.355
well maybe Islam is because you
don't have to be an Arab to be

00:34:02.355 --> 00:34:04.656
Muslim,
and you can see Muslims

00:34:04.656 --> 00:34:07.400
existing all through Asia and
that sort of thing,

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.239
and Africa.
 

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:12.119
So maybe Islam is the third
world religion.

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:14.869
Then kind of more for
ideological purposes they said,

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:18.204
we'll let the Jews in,
so Judaism can be a world

00:34:18.204 --> 00:34:20.559
religion also,
because you don't actually have

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:21.969
to be in one location to
practice it.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:25.092
Hinduism was a problem because
the very word "Hindu"

00:34:25.092 --> 00:34:27.806
is a made up term for a
religion because it just means

00:34:27.806 --> 00:34:28.369
Indian.
 

00:34:28.369 --> 00:34:33.257
Hinduism is a modern invention,
a label to put over whatever

00:34:33.257 --> 00:34:37.400
people in the subcontinent
practice that relates to

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.550
something that we would call
gods.

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.960
We're going to call that
"Hinduism."

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.077
So "Hinduism"
gets invented in the twentieth

00:34:45.077 --> 00:34:48.550
century, and then that gets to
be another world religion.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:49.989
Then you get this ideology.
 

00:34:49.989 --> 00:34:52.927
If you had taken a class in
world religions or Introduction

00:34:52.927 --> 00:34:55.077
to Religion in,
say, the year 1980,

00:34:55.077 --> 00:34:58.853
you would have probably read a
textbook that would probably

00:34:58.853 --> 00:35:01.652
list as the undisputed world
religions five:

00:35:01.652 --> 00:35:05.132
Christianity,
Judaism, Islam,

00:35:05.132 --> 00:35:08.719
Hinduism, and Buddhism.
 

00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:10.530
Now does Confucianism count?
 

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:16.349
Well, some textbooks would say
no.

00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:17.760
What do you do with paganism?
 

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:20.606
What about people who just
worship all kinds of gods of

00:35:20.606 --> 00:35:22.239
trees, and rocks,
and things?

00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:24.458
So this whole category of
having "world

00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:26.521
religions"
and having a list of them

00:35:26.521 --> 00:35:29.721
becomes something that really is
only developed in the academic

00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:32.250
study of religion in the
twentieth century.

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:36.527
If someone asked you the
question, how did this little

00:35:36.527 --> 00:35:40.641
movement, started by this Jewish
prophet in Galilee,

00:35:40.641 --> 00:35:43.789
how did it become a world
religion?

00:35:43.789 --> 00:35:46.079
You really--the most honest
question is to say,

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:48.795
well it didn't really happen
until scholars invented it in

00:35:48.795 --> 00:35:51.701
the twentieth century because
that's when the very category of

00:35:51.701 --> 00:35:54.369
"world religion"
came about for us to use.

00:35:54.369 --> 00:35:57.483
Of course if you wanted to say,
well when did you start having

00:35:57.483 --> 00:36:00.139
Christians all over the world,
not just in Europe?

00:36:00.139 --> 00:36:03.657
Well you'd have to say starting
in the seventeenth century with

00:36:03.657 --> 00:36:05.869
missions to North and South
America,

00:36:05.869 --> 00:36:08.199
and then really in the
nineteenth century with the

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:10.297
missionaries,
especially from England and

00:36:10.297 --> 00:36:12.414
North America,
going to China,

00:36:12.414 --> 00:36:16.389
and going to Japan,
and going to all over Africa.

00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:18.914
When you talk about,
when did this thing become a

00:36:18.914 --> 00:36:19.809
world religion?
 

00:36:19.809 --> 00:36:23.518
Probably about the nineteenth
century would be a good answer,

00:36:23.518 --> 00:36:26.239
but that's counterintuitive to
most of us.

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:30.954
The last question I'm going to
talk about is--nah,

00:36:30.954 --> 00:36:32.880
we're out of time.
 

00:36:36.199 --> 00:36:38.976
I was going to talk about why
did Christianity grow before

00:36:38.976 --> 00:36:39.659
Constantine?
 

00:36:39.659 --> 00:36:43.692
Obviously with Constantine you
get the emperor promoting this

00:36:43.692 --> 00:36:44.699
religion now.
 

00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:47.161
There are various theories
about what caused it to grow

00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:47.800
before that.
 

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:54.025
Some people have said because
they forbade abortion and birth

00:36:54.025 --> 00:36:56.619
control, contraception.
 

00:36:56.619 --> 00:36:59.215
Most early Christians seem to
think that contraception was

00:36:59.215 --> 00:37:01.764
wrong and abortion was wrong,
and putting out infants was

00:37:01.764 --> 00:37:02.219
wrong.
 

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:04.273
Some people will say,
well, it's because they

00:37:04.273 --> 00:37:05.300
promoted the family.
 

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.068
I don't particularly buy that
because we've got all these

00:37:08.068 --> 00:37:10.639
monks and nuns running around
too not reproducing.

00:37:10.639 --> 00:37:12.972
Some people have even said,
well, when Christians

00:37:12.972 --> 00:37:15.791
themselves write in this period
about why they grow and why

00:37:15.791 --> 00:37:18.902
people are flocking to them it's
because we're better healers and

00:37:18.902 --> 00:37:19.679
exorcists.
 

00:37:19.679 --> 00:37:23.150
We're better than Asclepius at
healing people and exorcising

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.679
demons.
 

00:37:23.679 --> 00:37:27.222
So Ramsey McMullen,
retired historian right here at

00:37:27.222 --> 00:37:29.315
Yale,
has written famously about this

00:37:29.315 --> 00:37:31.153
that,
apparently, in the second and

00:37:31.153 --> 00:37:34.141
third century Christians were
just really damn good healers

00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:38.329
and exorcists,
and that may be why they grew.

00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:40.909
The question of why
Christianity grew before then is

00:37:40.909 --> 00:37:43.541
a hot one that a lot of
historians are even right now

00:37:43.541 --> 00:37:44.199
debating.
 

00:37:44.199 --> 00:37:46.090
Are there any questions about
that?

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:50.650
I'm going to cut the lecture
there because I want to pass out

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.018
the final exams.
 

00:37:52.018 --> 00:37:54.731
I think we've talked enough
about in previous classes the

00:37:54.731 --> 00:37:57.590
difference between historical
interpretation and theological

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.985
interpretation,
and modern interpretation and

00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:02.565
post-modern interpretation,
that was what I was going to

00:38:02.565 --> 00:38:04.710
end up on but I believe we've
covered that enough,

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.375
and you can always ask me
questions about that later at

00:38:07.375 --> 00:38:08.610
some point if you like.
 

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:10.070
Let's pass the exams out please.
 

00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:17.710
Any questions while they're
doing that?

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:18.389
This is your chance.
 

00:38:18.389 --> 00:38:19.250
Yes sir?
 

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.612
Student:  Can you talk a
little bit about

00:38:21.612 --> 00:38:23.018
&gt;?
 

00:38:23.018 --> 00:38:26.550
Prof: Why we think Rome
was persecuting Christians?

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.505
Was your question,
what evidence do we have that

00:38:29.505 --> 00:38:33.090
they were doing it or why were
they motivated to do it?

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:33.760
Student: 
&gt;

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.260
Prof: Why were they
motivated to do it?

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:39.380
It's a very good question,
and you've got to realize that

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.795
so much of the power of Rome was
built on the ideology of the

00:38:43.795 --> 00:38:44.679
emperor.
 

00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:49.094
Romans really did believe that
they were the most pious nation

00:38:49.094 --> 00:38:49.889
on earth.
 

00:38:49.889 --> 00:38:53.271
This is why whenever the Roman
army went to another country

00:38:53.271 --> 00:38:56.130
they would always sacrifice to
the local gods,

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:58.927
because they believed the local
gods protected them and caused

00:38:58.927 --> 00:38:59.340
growth.
 

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.349
The Romans would sincerely
believe that if you don't

00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:05.358
sacrifice to the gods,
if you're not a pious person,

00:39:05.358 --> 00:39:07.010
the gods may punish you.
 

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.260
Well, what happens then if you
have a bunch of these Christians

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.219
running around who refuse to
sacrifice to the gods,

00:39:11.219 --> 00:39:12.768
refuse to sacrifice to the
emperor?

00:39:12.768 --> 00:39:15.684
Not only is it a threat against
the emperor himself,

00:39:15.684 --> 00:39:18.940
it's a threat against all the
people, and it's also just a

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.369
matter of patriotism.
 

00:39:20.369 --> 00:39:22.130
What would happen to you,
right after 9/11,

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:24.199
or even now,
if at a Yankees game when they

00:39:24.199 --> 00:39:26.911
stand up and we're going to sing
"The Star Spangled

00:39:26.911 --> 00:39:29.179
Banner,"
if you refused to stand up,

00:39:29.179 --> 00:39:32.043
you sat down,
you kept your baseball cap on

00:39:32.043 --> 00:39:33.963
your head,
and you started singing

00:39:33.963 --> 00:39:35.579
"Happy Birthday"
instead.

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:40.271
You're going to get beat up
because the locals just won't

00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:41.110
like it.
 

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.989
Well that's the way it was a
lot with early Christians.

00:39:42.989 --> 00:39:45.722
It was the locals who felt like
what they were doing was

00:39:45.722 --> 00:39:46.320
dangerous.
 

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:48.987
It tore against the social
fabric of Roman society,

00:39:48.987 --> 00:39:50.429
and it offended the gods.
 

00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:53.949
They had a lot of reasons to
try to suppress Christianity.

00:39:53.949 --> 00:39:55.289
Yes sir?
 

00:39:55.289 --> 00:39:57.059
Student:  Do we know why
Constantine converted?

00:39:57.059 --> 00:39:58.719
Prof: Do we know why
Constantine converted?

00:39:58.719 --> 00:40:01.389
He says it's because he saw a
vision right before the battle.

00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:03.429
Scholars debate that.
 

00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:06.621
Some scholars say he converted
because he looked around and he

00:40:06.621 --> 00:40:08.639
saw that this was,
although it was a minority

00:40:08.639 --> 00:40:10.320
movement,
there was no way that this was

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.333
a majority,
it was a vibrant movement that

00:40:12.333 --> 00:40:14.414
was going on in Rome,
in the Roman Empire,

00:40:14.414 --> 00:40:16.800
and maybe he said,
that's something I can use.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.554
He was already an admirer of
the sun god, and he was moving

00:40:20.554 --> 00:40:24.177
toward a certain form of
monotheism where the sun was the

00:40:24.177 --> 00:40:25.018
only god.
 

00:40:25.018 --> 00:40:28.867
Some people say it wasn't that
big of a jump for him to switch

00:40:28.867 --> 00:40:31.422
that to Jesus,
and so some people say,

00:40:31.422 --> 00:40:35.420
he had this political idea that
it would be a smart thing to do

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:38.000
and that he made up the vision
later.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.889
There are different reasons.
 

00:40:39.889 --> 00:40:42.643
We don't really know truly his
psychological motivations for

00:40:42.643 --> 00:40:43.250
conversion.
 

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:45.050
Okay--yes sir?
 

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.914
Student:  What's the
nature of

00:40:49.914 --> 00:40:53.699
&gt;?
 

00:40:53.699 --> 00:40:55.277
Prof: The question was
what was the nature of

00:40:55.277 --> 00:40:55.710
persecution?
 

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.447
Was it really throwing
Christians to the lions and that

00:40:57.447 --> 00:40:58.864
sort of thing,
or was it more like destroying

00:40:58.864 --> 00:40:59.510
Christian texts?
 

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:01.130
It was different things at
different times.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.969
A lot of times it was
crucifixion or killing people,

00:41:04.969 --> 00:41:06.989
torture to get the people to
confess,

00:41:06.989 --> 00:41:10.079
sometimes, especially in the
Decian Persecution,

00:41:10.079 --> 00:41:13.148
there was an attempt to force
priests and bishops to turn over

00:41:13.148 --> 00:41:14.860
Bibles and Christian literature.
 

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.266
And in fact,
people could save their lives

00:41:17.266 --> 00:41:20.085
by giving up Christian books or
Christian Bibles,

00:41:20.085 --> 00:41:23.079
and they would be destroyed by
the authorities.

00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:26.467
It took different forms like
that, and sometimes it was just

00:41:26.467 --> 00:41:27.730
less overt pressure.
 

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:30.250
You couldn't get promoted,
you couldn't do certain things,

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:33.251
sometimes people would try to
get you out of the Roman army if

00:41:33.251 --> 00:41:35.170
they found out you were a
Christian,

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:36.949
and so it took different forms.
 

00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:38.630
Yes sir?
 

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:41.000
Student: 
&gt;?

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.949
Prof: The institution of
what?

00:41:42.949 --> 00:41:43.539
Student: 
&gt;

00:41:43.539 --> 00:41:45.719
Prof: The papacy?
 

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:48.570
He asked about the institution
of the papacy.

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:50.518
It was originally simply the
Bishop of Rome.

00:41:50.518 --> 00:41:53.782
But as you might imagine,
pretty early in Christianity in

00:41:53.782 --> 00:41:56.172
the third century,
the bishops of the most

00:41:56.172 --> 00:41:58.969
important cities just became
more important.

00:41:58.969 --> 00:42:01.704
The Bishop of Jerusalem was
important because Jerusalem was

00:42:01.704 --> 00:42:02.268
important.
 

00:42:02.268 --> 00:42:04.503
The Bishop of Alexandria was
important because Alexandria was

00:42:04.503 --> 00:42:04.949
important.
 

00:42:04.949 --> 00:42:06.867
The Bishop of Constantinople
was important because it was

00:42:06.867 --> 00:42:07.449
Constantinople.
 

00:42:07.449 --> 00:42:10.143
Likewise, the Bishop of Rome
was important,

00:42:10.143 --> 00:42:14.121
and there was struggling among
different major bishoprics about

00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:16.110
which one would be leading.
 

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:19.657
Rome was still considered the
center of the earth for a long

00:42:19.657 --> 00:42:22.246
time,
and so gradually it just became

00:42:22.246 --> 00:42:26.393
so that the Bishop of Rome just
sort of held preeminence among

00:42:26.393 --> 00:42:29.514
all other bishops,
and it was informal in how it

00:42:29.514 --> 00:42:30.130
developed.
 

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:34.268
The real recognition of the
Bishop of Rome as sort of the

00:42:34.268 --> 00:42:38.777
Pope, in the way we think of it,
that actually develops in the

00:42:38.777 --> 00:42:39.960
Middle Ages.
 

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:44.579
You don't, for example,
have papal infallibility

00:42:44.579 --> 00:42:50.380
declared as a doctrine until the
early twentieth century.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:57.425
So when we think of the Roman
papacy now as being sort of the

00:42:57.425 --> 00:43:04.940
infallible Pope who has kind of
has full say over everything,

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.456
that really is almost a
development that starts more in

00:43:08.456 --> 00:43:12.039
the medieval period and comes
into the modern period.

00:43:12.039 --> 00:43:17.797
In the beginning he was just
recognized as the head--the sort

00:43:17.797 --> 00:43:21.539
of recognized,
more respected bishop.

00:43:21.539 --> 00:43:23.679
Alright, let's talk about the
finals.

00:43:23.679 --> 00:43:27.782
You have two questions on your
final and you get to choose

00:43:27.782 --> 00:43:29.510
Option A and Option B.
 

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:31.210
I'm not going to read all of
this;

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.742
you can talk to your section
leaders, email them,

00:43:33.742 --> 00:43:36.909
talk to me, and email me if you
have questions about this.

00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:39.130
The things that I want to
stress are a few things.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:41.500
Don't go to the library.
 

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.356
If you need things like a
concordance, that's great,

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:46.869
use a concordance.
 

00:43:46.869 --> 00:43:48.909
Use a Bible dictionary if
there's something you just don't

00:43:48.909 --> 00:43:50.449
know the meaning of a word or a
concept,

00:43:50.449 --> 00:43:52.777
but don't go look up
commentaries because already

00:43:52.777 --> 00:43:55.737
we've gotten papers from some of
you that it's clear that what

00:43:55.737 --> 00:43:58.405
you did was you went and read
some book somewhere in the

00:43:58.405 --> 00:44:01.559
library that told you about
something in the New Testament.

00:44:01.559 --> 00:44:04.835
Chances are it's bullshit
because there's been more shit

00:44:04.835 --> 00:44:08.648
written about the Bible than any
other topic in the world for the

00:44:08.648 --> 00:44:09.840
last 2000 years.
 

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.728
Even if you're taking this
semester course you may not be

00:44:12.728 --> 00:44:15.309
able to tell the good stuff from
the bad stuff,

00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:17.447
so you don't need other
scholarship to answer these

00:44:17.447 --> 00:44:17.960
questions.
 

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.143
These questions are designed so
that you can use Bart Ehrman's

00:44:21.143 --> 00:44:23.320
textbook,
the tools we've shown you,

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.617
and the notes from class,
and just your own brain and the

00:44:26.617 --> 00:44:28.469
primary text you've been
reading.

00:44:28.469 --> 00:44:31.646
You can answer these questions
yourself with what we've given

00:44:31.646 --> 00:44:32.440
you in class.
 

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.583
That's one the main things is:
don't try to go to the library

00:44:34.583 --> 00:44:35.869
to get answers to these
questions.

00:44:35.869 --> 00:44:37.000
Use your brain.
 

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.789
I'm going to stress the length.
 

00:44:41.789 --> 00:44:45.530
We've always said eight pages,
but some of my teaching fellows

00:44:45.530 --> 00:44:49.335
have been complaining that you
all have creative ways of either

00:44:49.335 --> 00:44:51.849
stretching or shrinking eight
pages,

00:44:51.849 --> 00:44:54.130
and so there's a word limit,
2,500 words.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:56.942
So we're still looking for
eight pages, double spaced,

00:44:56.942 --> 00:44:58.639
but not to exceed 2,500 words.
 

00:44:58.639 --> 00:45:00.800
Use your word counter on your
software now.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.139
The papers are due by 5:00 p.m.
 

00:45:04.139 --> 00:45:05.909
Monday April 27th.
 

00:45:05.909 --> 00:45:08.411
You may email them as an
attachment to your teaching

00:45:08.411 --> 00:45:11.353
fellow, if the teaching fellow
has given you permission to do

00:45:11.353 --> 00:45:13.070
that, and I think they all did.
 

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:15.934
If you want to turn in a hard
copy please do so at the

00:45:15.934 --> 00:45:18.800
Religious Studies Department on
451 College Street.

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:22.094
Both of the questions address
the kind of issues we raised all

00:45:22.094 --> 00:45:24.416
semester long,
so they shouldn't really be a

00:45:24.416 --> 00:45:25.119
surprise.
 

00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:27.617
Several times we've talked
about how did Christianity

00:45:27.617 --> 00:45:30.246
spread geographically,
and when I gave the lecture on

00:45:30.246 --> 00:45:32.342
Acts,
I explained how Acts gives you

00:45:32.342 --> 00:45:35.340
a schematic outline of the
growth of Christianity.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:39.530
Taking that one lecture on Acts
and the readings that you've

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.329
done with that,
and then pull things from other

00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:44.730
lectures and from other things
in the semester,

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.887
sort of thinking about,
well, now what kind of

00:45:47.887 --> 00:45:51.960
Christianity would promote the
sort of letters of John,

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.619
what kind of Christianity would
look different,

00:45:53.619 --> 00:45:56.900
and use other of these writings
to say,

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.648
well, I think maybe this kind
of Christianity may have

00:45:58.648 --> 00:45:59.639
developed a bit differently.
 

00:45:59.639 --> 00:46:01.260
You can focus on doctrinal
issues,

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:04.018
you can focus on social
structures or forms,

00:46:04.018 --> 00:46:06.271
you can focus on ideologies,
and many of the issues that

00:46:06.271 --> 00:46:07.909
we've raised throughout the
semester,

00:46:07.909 --> 00:46:08.909
it's your choice.
 

00:46:08.909 --> 00:46:12.661
The main thing is to show how
Christianity did not develop in

00:46:12.661 --> 00:46:16.286
the smooth schematic way that
it's presented in the Book of

00:46:16.286 --> 00:46:16.849
Acts.
 

00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:19.463
The second question,
I've given a couple of lectures

00:46:19.463 --> 00:46:22.130
where I've stressed a whole lot
more Christology,

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:25.045
what Christology is,
the nature of Christ and how

00:46:25.045 --> 00:46:28.264
different early Christian
documents seem to be working

00:46:28.264 --> 00:46:30.268
with different Christologies.
 

00:46:30.268 --> 00:46:34.900
You're given three columns of
text, primary text,

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.760
and it's a Chinese menu kind of
thing.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.190
You have to use at least one
source from column A,

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:44.695
at least one source form Column
B, and at least one source from

00:46:44.695 --> 00:46:47.550
Column C,
and you can use any others too.

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:51.307
You're not restricted to this
but you have to use one of each

00:46:51.307 --> 00:46:54.565
of those sources in order to
construct this answer of

00:46:54.565 --> 00:46:57.759
illustrating the diversity of
Christology's in early

00:46:57.759 --> 00:46:58.949
Christianity.
 

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.280
Any questions?
 

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:07.500
We do not accept or read late
papers.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.829
They just get a flat zero.
 

00:47:10.829 --> 00:47:15.043
If you do need an extension,
ask for it ahead of time,

00:47:15.043 --> 00:47:16.315
not at 5:00 p.m.
 

00:47:16.315 --> 00:47:17.349
on Monday.
 

00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:21.822
All right, your teaching
fellows have the authority to

00:47:21.822 --> 00:47:26.800
work with me and grant you an
extension, but you have to ask

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.909
for it ahead of time.
 

00:47:28.909 --> 00:47:32.201
Otherwise we expect those
papers to be done by 5:00 p.m.

00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:32.739
Monday.

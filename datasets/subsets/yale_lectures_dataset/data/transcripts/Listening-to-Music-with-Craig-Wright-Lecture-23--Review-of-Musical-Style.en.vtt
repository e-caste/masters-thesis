00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.706
Prof: All right.
 

00:00:02.706 --> 00:00:07.310
Let's proceed with our
discussion of musical style.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.959
And this is going to be mostly
a comparison of musical style in

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.490
different style periods.
 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.554
And we've put the titles of
those style periods up on the

00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:18.820
board there.
 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.830
Once again, this is a typically
Western exercise that we are

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.190
dealing with here.
 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.505
We love to organize material so
that we can simplify it and we

00:00:28.505 --> 00:00:32.360
can deal with it--
whether it's attributing to an

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.068
individual,
things that a large number of

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:38.093
people do,
whether it's grouping random

00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:42.513
units of pulses into meter,
or whether it's taking a highly

00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:46.308
complex group of phenomena and
putting them particular style

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:49.223
periods,
we like to do that because it

00:00:49.223 --> 00:00:52.918
allows us to deal with the
material in some kind of

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.470
organized fashion.
 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.170
So we've got our various
periods up here.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.316
As mentioned though,
we won't going into the

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:03.609
post-modernist in any
significant way here.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.289
Now what you'll be asked to do
is identify the period in which

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:12.816
a particular piece is written,
and if it turns out that on our

00:01:12.816 --> 00:01:16.150
final test,
we happen to play for you a

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.849
piece that's on the list of
pieces that we give you,

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:23.018
then you're responsible for
identifying the name of the

00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:25.188
composer and the name of the
piece.

00:01:25.188 --> 00:01:29.158
If the piece we play is not on
your list, then all you would be

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:31.909
asked to do is identify the
style period.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.304
However, you're asked to do
something even more important

00:01:35.304 --> 00:01:38.819
than that and that's to tell us
why it's in this particular

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:39.849
style period.
 

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:41.791
It does no good--I don't
think--just to say

00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:43.965
"Romantic"
and then going to walk away

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:44.519
from it.
 

00:01:44.519 --> 00:01:49.643
What I would ask you to do is
give us three or four specific

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:54.331
points that you hear in the
music that corroborate your

00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:58.239
decision with regard to the
style period.

00:01:58.239 --> 00:02:01.590
Now, you may wish to take a
look at your textbook there,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.709
around page sixty-seven,
sixty-eight,

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.671
sixty-nine, where there's an
introduction to musical style

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:09.015
and a checklist,
as I call it--checklist of

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:10.318
musical style by period.
 

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:15.008
And that'll kind of get you
thinking in these sorts of ways.

00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:16.854
The Baroque music,
for example,

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:20.176
tends to have rather long,
asymmetrical themes but very

00:02:20.176 --> 00:02:21.900
driving sorts of rhythm.
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.424
So you could learn that
checklist for each of these

00:02:25.424 --> 00:02:28.687
periods,
but the important thing is that

00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:33.580
when we play the music you have
got to hear in that music that

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.992
particular phenomenon or
characteristic that you list on

00:02:37.992 --> 00:02:42.485
your group of three or four
factors that lead you to your

00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:43.930
conclusion.
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.988
For example,
you may recognize the piece of

00:02:46.988 --> 00:02:51.285
be--as being of the Romantic
period and say that it has lots

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:52.960
of low brass in it.
 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.510
It may not have any low brass
in the music we're playing at

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.940
all, so that wouldn't be doing
very much for us there.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.384
So we want to hear the music
and we want to take things out

00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:05.938
of the music that we're actually
hearing.

00:03:05.938 --> 00:03:07.770
So maybe we'll start with a
piece here.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.098
Now what we've got is a series
of six,

00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:13.639
seven--depends on how many you
want this morning--

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:17.763
particular pieces chosen to
exemplify these various style

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:18.500
periods.
 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:48.150
 
 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.128
Now, what are you going to be
listening for here?

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:53.680
I was thinking about that this
morning.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.090
What's the most important thing
when trying to identify style?

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.440
What will allow you to get to
the answer quickest?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.258
What do you think it is?
 

00:04:03.258 --> 00:04:04.810
What are you going to be
listening for?

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.331
Let's go back to the radio in
the car business--or you

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.123
suddenly turn on some sort of
streaming FM,

00:04:11.123 --> 00:04:12.718
middle of the piece.
 

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.580
What is it that's going to give
you the most information?

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.730
Roger.
 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.740
Student: Instrumentation.
 

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.940
Prof: Instruments,
right, absolutely.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:20.300
Okay.
 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.564
It's the instruments,
because if you hear lots of

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:27.714
percussion and xylophones and
things such as that banging away

00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:31.601
in a dissonant fashion,
those instruments just weren't

00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:34.019
there in time of Mozart,
for example,

00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:37.406
so you know it's got to be
probably late nineteenth-century

00:04:37.406 --> 00:04:37.990
and on.
 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.632
So instrumentation is the
single most important factor,

00:04:41.632 --> 00:04:45.680
but some instruments are common
to many different periods.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.690
The piano operated roughly from
when to when?

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.692
If you hear a piano,
what does that tell you about

00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:55.122
the time period of the music
that you're--classical music

00:04:55.122 --> 00:04:56.899
that you're listening to?
 

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:59.339
It's got to be roughly after
what?

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:04.319
After--or after who?
 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.839
When did the piano really
become the principal keyboard

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:11.519
instrument in Western culture?
 

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:16.730
Roughly 1770 or so, 1760,1770.
 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.713
As I've said,
Mozart was the first to really

00:05:19.713 --> 00:05:23.113
use the piano exclusively,
so if you hear a piano,

00:05:23.113 --> 00:05:25.889
it can't be Renaissance or
medieval;

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.050
it can't be Baroque.
 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.329
It could be Classical,
Romantic, Impressionist,

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:33.577
or Modern, and then on the
basis of other things you would

00:05:33.577 --> 00:05:36.199
come to a conclusion about the
style period.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.759
What might something else be?
 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.726
Roger, with the help of
Caroline there,

00:05:40.726 --> 00:05:44.476
was able to tell us that
instrumentation was very

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:45.959
important here.
 

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:51.161
After instrumentation,
what is it that we might be

00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:52.860
listening for?
 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.899
Marcus.
 

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:57.430
Student:
&gt;

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:58.728
Prof: Okay.
 

00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:01.180
Yeah, the volume,
the size of it.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.519
That in some way--Yeah.
 

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:05.509
So, specifically speaking,
it's not just the instruments.

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.302
It could be volume as well and
the later--what's the pinnacle

00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:10.629
in terms of volume?
 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:11.930
What would you say?
 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.879
Is it all just a straight-line
ascent to present day in terms

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:16.670
of volume?
 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.110
When's the biggest orchestra
around?

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.589
We talked about that.
 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:25.000
Marcus.
 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.529
Student: It was Romantic.
 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:26.560
Prof: Okay. Romantic.
 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.620
Can you refine it any further
than that?

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.269
Student: Late Romantic.
 

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:33.425
Prof: Late Romantic,
Mahler, Strauss,

00:06:33.425 --> 00:06:34.480
that kind of thing.
 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.324
Mahler wrote a "Symphony
of a Thousand,"

00:06:36.324 --> 00:06:36.889
he called it.
 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.170
He had almost a thousand
performers in it.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.492
So it's late nineteenth,
early twentieth century,

00:06:42.492 --> 00:06:44.848
and then it sort of,
in an odd way,

00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:46.509
declines thereafter.
 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:48.089
So volume is important.
 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:52.163
Just to move things along here,
I think the harmony is

00:06:52.163 --> 00:06:55.620
important too,
and you can pick out,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.790
sometimes, chords,
not necessarily the specific

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.553
chords,
but does it kind of sound plain

00:07:01.553 --> 00:07:06.129
vanilla harmony or does it sound
a little bit surprising,

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:08.117
or--not shocking,
but bracing,

00:07:08.117 --> 00:07:09.009
unexpected?
 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.490
Well, the more unexpected it
becomes probably the later you

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.430
are, the more into the Romantic
period you are.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.089
And most importantly I think,
maybe even more important than

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:22.500
that, is the element of
consonance versus dissonance.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:26.334
When do we begin to get a heavy
component of dissonance in high

00:07:26.334 --> 00:07:27.819
art music in the West?
 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.639
Classical period?
 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.259
Romantic period?
 

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.350
Impressionist period?
 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.910
A little bit.
 

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.509
Yeah, I see Kristin.
 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:43.139
Well, maybe. Okay? Yeah.
 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:46.321
So a little bit in the
Impressionist period and then

00:07:46.321 --> 00:07:50.060
heavy in the Modernist period,
and then it actually backs down

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.658
in the Post-modern period,
but we're not going there.

00:07:52.658 --> 00:07:52.949
Roger.
 

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:54.620
Student:
&gt;

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.350
Prof: Good point.
 

00:07:56.350 --> 00:08:00.456
It can be present in Medieval
music, so in an odd way,

00:08:00.456 --> 00:08:01.000
yeah.
 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.560
The notion of consonant
harmonies really didn't get

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.427
formed until the fifteenth
century so if you're listening

00:08:06.427 --> 00:08:08.680
to things before the fifteenth
century,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.038
sometimes you can find rather
bracing and biting dissonance in

00:08:12.038 --> 00:08:14.540
Medieval music,
and then it sort of smoothed

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.430
itself out for five hundred
years.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.737
Okay.
 

00:08:16.737 --> 00:08:20.247
So I think we have our first
selection queued now so let's

00:08:20.247 --> 00:08:23.017
just listen to this,
and these are going to be

00:08:23.017 --> 00:08:25.790
rather long as they will be in
the test.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:09:20.779
&gt;
 

00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:22.220
So we've heard that much.
 

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.357
Right off the bat,
some things should be ruled

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:26.908
out.
 

00:09:26.908 --> 00:09:28.289
So what do we want to rule out
here?

00:09:28.289 --> 00:09:31.360
Douglas in the back.
 

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.539
Pick--and I'm going to cold
call people today.

00:09:33.539 --> 00:09:34.679
Yes, Doug.
 

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:38.789
What would we rule out there?
 

00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:42.389
Student: Classical.
 

00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:43.679
Prof: Okay. Classical.
 

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.750
Mozart, Haydn, even Beethoven.
 

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.797
We would rule out classical,
and in ruling out classical,

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:50.428
that sort of wipes out what?
 

00:09:50.428 --> 00:09:52.590
Basically everything else
before.

00:09:52.590 --> 00:09:58.726
So it can't be anything
after--excuse me--before--well,

00:09:58.726 --> 00:10:05.432
it can't be anything really
before 1800, so we'll start with

00:10:05.432 --> 00:10:06.908
Romantic.
 

00:10:06.908 --> 00:10:11.320
So, still in the game here:
Romantic, Impressionist and

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.298
Modernist.
 

00:10:12.298 --> 00:10:15.077
Any thoughts about that:
Romantic, Impressionist,

00:10:15.077 --> 00:10:15.600
Modern?
 

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.950
Caroline.
 

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.663
I don't--just tell me--don't
tell me the--what you think the

00:10:20.663 --> 00:10:21.418
answer is.
 

00:10:21.418 --> 00:10:23.558
Just tell me what you heard
there.

00:10:23.558 --> 00:10:25.350
Student:
&gt;

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.278
Prof: Louder, please.
 

00:10:28.278 --> 00:10:33.808
Student:
&gt;

00:10:33.808 --> 00:10:35.044
Prof: Okay.
 

00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:38.683
So may--possibly some
strange-sounding scales and some

00:10:38.683 --> 00:10:39.918
bells you said?
 

00:10:39.918 --> 00:10:44.374
What were--did you hear--what
else did you--a big orchestra,

00:10:44.374 --> 00:10:45.960
a little orchestra?
 

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.590
Student:
&gt;

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.008
Prof: I beg your pardon.
 

00:10:49.008 --> 00:10:49.740
Huge orchestra?
 

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.056
Huge orchestra and huge sound.
 

00:10:52.056 --> 00:10:52.519
Okay?
 

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:57.302
So where does that put us in
the spectrum here,

00:10:57.302 --> 00:10:58.549
1800-2000?
 

00:10:58.549 --> 00:11:01.250
Well, we talked about that.
 

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.565
Probably around 1900 or so,
with an orchestra that big,

00:11:05.565 --> 00:11:10.200
and you heard voices in it,
which is interesting to comment

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.158
on also.
 

00:11:11.158 --> 00:11:13.879
So then you might ask yourself,
"Well, is this

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:14.860
Beethoven?"
 

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.080
Well, it's too big for
Beethoven.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.029
It's too--there's too much of
it.

00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:20.330
It's too rich for Beethoven.
 

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:21.278
Is it Wagner?
 

00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:24.539
It's probably even too rich for
Wagner;

00:11:24.539 --> 00:11:25.500
it's just bigger.
 

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:30.590
So we're pushing on here after
1850.

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.734
Let's listen to a bit more
and--because the excerpts that

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:36.428
we will have on next Wednesday
will be longer.

00:11:36.428 --> 00:11:39.023
Let's listen to a bit more and
see if we can gather some

00:11:39.023 --> 00:11:39.919
information here.
 

00:11:39.919 --> 00:12:05.549
&gt;
 

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:06.788
What are we hearing there?
 

00:12:06.788 --> 00:12:08.970
A very important piece of
information there.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.580
 
 

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.649
What was that?
 

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:14.299
What instrument was playing?
 

00:12:14.299 --> 00:12:16.990
Oboe was playing. Daniel.
 

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:20.320
Student:
&gt;

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.327
Prof: Okay.
 

00:12:21.327 --> 00:12:24.070
They had the melody,
and what about that melody?

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.035
How did it go?
 

00:12:27.035 --> 00:12:32.970
&gt;
 

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:33.534
What's that?
 

00:12:33.534 --> 00:12:35.090
Yes, Kristin's got it out
there.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:36.110
Nice and loud, please.
 

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:37.029
Student: Ostinato.
 

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:38.720
Prof: It's an ostinato.
 

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.750
So what does that tell us if
we're trying--

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.876
which one of the three of these
style periods does that knock

00:12:45.876 --> 00:12:48.269
out of the box:
Romantic,

00:12:48.269 --> 00:12:49.710
Impressionist or Modern?
 

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:56.740
We talked about that in a
lecture on Impressionism,

00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.384
but by the same token,
your Listening Exercise

00:13:00.384 --> 00:13:04.432
forty-two on Stravinsky
foregrounded precisely this

00:13:04.432 --> 00:13:06.620
phenomenon of ostinato.
 

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.447
So there we have Romantic being
taken out of the mix here and

00:13:11.447 --> 00:13:16.759
this idea of stasis is not part
of the aesthetic of Romanticism.

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:20.009
Romantic flows,
it grows, it expands,

00:13:20.009 --> 00:13:23.441
it contracts,
but it doesn't constantly

00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:26.058
reiterate one phenomenon.
 

00:13:26.058 --> 00:13:30.820
So we--we're down to
Impressionist or Modern here.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.100
Let's go on and listen to just
a little bit more.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:14:37.669
&gt;
 

00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:38.710
So what did we hear there?
 

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.779
Anything more that we could add
to our list of identifiers?

00:14:41.779 --> 00:14:45.360
Oscar.
 

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.950
Student:
&gt;

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.825
Prof: Good.
 

00:14:47.825 --> 00:14:49.769
Parallel motion,
&gt;.

00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:52.658
Those woodwinds were all going
up and down in the same

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.130
direction, parallel motion.
 

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:54.840
Excellent.
 

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.440
There's one other thing here.
 

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.799
At the very end we heard what
played by a harp?

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.528
Caroline.
 

00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:03.168
Student:
&gt;

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:05.820
Prof: A glissando,
that kind of wash.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.633
So based on that,
obviously we are dealing with a

00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:10.450
piece of Impressionist music.
 

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:14.644
This is Ravel's Daphnis and
Chloe, ballet music for one

00:15:14.644 --> 00:15:18.976
of those Diaghilev ballets that
we were talking about in section

00:15:18.976 --> 00:15:19.940
last time.
 

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.980
So what would we say here?
 

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.308
Well, we would say large,
colorful orchestra.

00:15:25.308 --> 00:15:28.506
Actually, there was also the
use of the human voice here

00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:30.600
which we heard in Debussy as
well.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.259
We would say also that it's
essentially a consonant and not

00:15:34.259 --> 00:15:37.480
a dissonant--essentially a
consonant environment.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.721
We would say that we have
parallel motion,

00:15:40.721 --> 00:15:42.538
as Oscar pointed out.
 

00:15:42.538 --> 00:15:46.048
We would say that we have,
possibly--

00:15:46.048 --> 00:15:48.950
if you wanted to throw this
in--scales that are not

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.245
traditional--
although that's a little bit

00:15:51.245 --> 00:15:53.594
hard to hear--
but certainly we had the

00:15:53.594 --> 00:15:54.320
glissando.
 

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.599
So if you're looking for four
sound bites here or four bullet

00:15:58.599 --> 00:16:01.308
points to put on your paper:
large,

00:16:01.308 --> 00:16:04.548
colorful orchestra,
consonant backdrop,

00:16:04.548 --> 00:16:09.080
parallelism,
and--what did we say?

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.960
The glissando at the very end.
 

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.825
And you're finished,
you're out, you get a hundred

00:16:13.825 --> 00:16:14.408
percent.
 

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:14.696
Okay.
 

00:16:14.696 --> 00:16:17.900
So that's piece number one and
that's sort of the thought

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.278
process that I hope you would
use while working through this

00:16:21.278 --> 00:16:22.710
particular exercise.
 

00:16:22.710 --> 00:17:25.644
Let's go on to piece number two
which I think--&lt;&lt;music

00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:43.779
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:45.279
That's a good example of what?
 

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:52.359
Chant, just Gregorian chant,
&gt;

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:54.140
chant incipit there.
 

00:17:54.140 --> 00:18:00.410
 
 

00:18:00.410 --> 00:19:50.970
&gt;
 

00:19:50.970 --> 00:20:03.059
&gt;
 

00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:04.549
That's really beautiful.
 

00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:06.528
It's weird, but it's beautiful.
 

00:20:06.528 --> 00:20:10.184
That's a setting of--well,
you tell me what period it

00:20:10.184 --> 00:20:11.098
comes from.
 

00:20:11.098 --> 00:20:15.880
I'm going to move--skip around
a little bit.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.028
Let me go to Emily,
please, behind.

00:20:20.028 --> 00:20:21.160
Student: Medieval and
Renaissance.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.838
Prof: Medieval and
Renaissance.

00:20:22.838 --> 00:20:25.828
We had chant there and on the
same CD we have an example

00:20:25.828 --> 00:20:28.710
of--this is actually sort of
right between the two.

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.980
It's written by Thomas Tallis
in England, but England was sort

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.713
of slow to catch up to the
Renaissance, so it's late

00:20:34.713 --> 00:20:36.430
Medieval, early Renaissance.
 

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:40.788
What specifically did we hear
here that leads you to that

00:20:40.788 --> 00:20:41.799
conclusion?
 

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:48.190
Jennifer? Jessica. Sorry.
 

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.230
What?
 

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.538
Student: Angela.
 

00:20:49.538 --> 00:20:50.993
Prof: Angela.
 

00:20:50.993 --> 00:20:51.430
Sorry.
 

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.940
Okay.
 

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:54.076
Student: We heard
multiple

00:20:54.076 --> 00:20:55.880
&gt;
 

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.009
Prof: Okay.
 

00:20:57.009 --> 00:20:59.519
We heard multiple unaccompanied
voices.

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:02.430
What kind of texture was being
employed there?

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.940
Student: Mostly
polyphonic.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.367
Prof: Mostly polyphonic,
and we said within the textures

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:10.800
we had imitative and
non-imitative polyphonic

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.519
textures.
 

00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:13.750
Was this imitative or
non-imitative?

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.358
Student:
&gt;

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:18.329
Prof: Everybody agree
with that?

00:21:18.329 --> 00:21:20.048
Anyone disagree with it?
 

00:21:20.048 --> 00:21:21.808
Some people are shaking their
head.

00:21:21.808 --> 00:21:25.338
It was non-imitative--or
no--excuse me--it was imitative.

00:21:25.338 --> 00:21:30.469
If I had time to play it again,
you could hear one voice would

00:21:30.469 --> 00:21:33.160
come in, &gt;
 

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.328
and then somebody else would
come in, &gt;

00:21:37.328 --> 00:21:40.448
and then the third voice and
the fourth voice,

00:21:40.448 --> 00:21:44.328
but you're right to say
multiple voices unaccompanied.

00:21:44.328 --> 00:21:49.884
So you sort of get two points
for that, and what do we call

00:21:49.884 --> 00:21:52.470
that unaccompanied style?
 

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.298
Student:
&gt;

00:21:54.298 --> 00:21:54.946
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:57.140
So--but we don't get a separate
point for a cappella.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.519
Unaccompanied a cappella
style would be one marker there.

00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:05.778
The idea of imitative voices
would be another.

00:22:05.778 --> 00:22:09.769
You might even pick up on the
text, I suppose--that it's in

00:22:09.769 --> 00:22:10.869
what language?
 

00:22:10.869 --> 00:22:13.410
Latin, yeah.
 

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:14.700
What else there?
 

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.430
That it's not particularly
rhythmic.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:18.750
No strong rhythms or meters.
 

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:23.440
It flows gently like Gregorian
chant,

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:27.938
and, as mentioned,
we have this texture that's not

00:22:27.938 --> 00:22:31.608
only polyphonic but highly
imitative,

00:22:31.608 --> 00:22:36.089
and those are all hallmarks of
late Medieval,

00:22:36.089 --> 00:22:38.058
Renaissance music.
 

00:22:38.058 --> 00:22:40.720
That particular piece was
written by an English composer,

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.200
Thomas Tallis,
but more interesting,

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.227
in a way, it's a setting of the
old "Lamentations of

00:22:46.227 --> 00:22:48.550
Jeremiah"
out of the Old Testament that

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.390
laments the fall of Jerusalem.
 

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:54.199
So it's a particularly dark,
heartfelt text and exquisitely

00:22:54.199 --> 00:22:57.089
set there in that Renaissance
vocal style.

00:22:57.089 --> 00:22:59.410
Let's go on to another one now.
 

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:17.259
 
 

00:23:17.259 --> 00:23:54.730
&gt;
 

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.490
Sometimes you can figure this
out in about three seconds.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.578
It doesn't take much more than
that.

00:23:59.578 --> 00:24:01.917
So with just that,
and we'll be playing a lot more

00:24:01.917 --> 00:24:04.544
than three seconds--many minutes
and, depending upon the

00:24:04.544 --> 00:24:06.740
particular piece,
probably more than once.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.890
So what did you hear there?
 

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.950
And we may go back and hear
just that much.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:12.970
What did you hear there?
 

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:16.817
Let's talk about what you heard
and then we'll conclude about

00:24:16.817 --> 00:24:18.420
the period in question.
 

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.150
So someone get us started.
 

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.940
Nicole.
 

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.108
Student: A lot of
percussion.

00:24:23.108 --> 00:24:24.782
Prof: A lot of
percussion.

00:24:24.782 --> 00:24:25.150
Okay.
 

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:29.579
Very--definitely,
particularly the tympani.

00:24:29.579 --> 00:24:30.528
Marcos.
 

00:24:30.528 --> 00:24:31.210
Student:
&gt;

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:32.859
Prof: A lot of
dissonance.

00:24:32.859 --> 00:24:33.940
That was very prominent.
 

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.298
It started out okay.
 

00:24:35.298 --> 00:24:37.755
It could have been a kind of
John Williams "Star

00:24:37.755 --> 00:24:39.548
Wars" type sound up until
the--

00:24:39.548 --> 00:24:42.380
about the third iteration of
one particular figure,

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.530
but the level at--the pitches
at which it was brought in

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:47.880
produced a very dissonant moment
there.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.623
So initially you say, "Oh,
maybe John Williams and

00:24:50.623 --> 00:24:54.270
Romanticism knockoff kind of
thing," but when that

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:57.019
dissonant enters,
then that takes you in to a

00:24:57.019 --> 00:24:58.299
slightly different realm.
 

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:59.420
Daniel.
 

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.044
Student: There's a lot
of blaring brass,

00:25:02.044 --> 00:25:04.269
and it's kind of in a
percussive way.

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:05.280
Prof: Okay.
 

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.529
A lot of brass,
and even if they were not

00:25:07.529 --> 00:25:10.396
percussion instruments,
those instruments were being

00:25:10.396 --> 00:25:13.319
used in a kind of percussive,
in-your-face way.

00:25:13.319 --> 00:25:14.950
Yeah.
 

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.289
So those are three good things.
 

00:25:16.289 --> 00:25:17.390
Roger, you got another one?
 

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:18.799
Student: There were lots
of ostinatos.

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:19.890
Prof: I beg your pardon.
 

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:21.104
Student: Lots of--
Prof: Yes,

00:25:21.104 --> 00:25:22.519
there were lots of ostinatos
right at the beginning.

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:25.338
I almost forgot about that,
and may have only been just two

00:25:25.338 --> 00:25:26.750
notes going back and forth.
 

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:31.788
So already we've got our four,
and maybe that's all we need.

00:25:31.788 --> 00:25:34.400
Let's listen to just the--it's
not a long excerpt.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.109
Let's listen to the beginning
of this again.

00:25:37.109 --> 00:25:39.740
&gt;
 

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:46.470
Could be Romanticism
&gt;

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.423
with that entry right there,
very dissonant &lt;&lt;music

00:25:49.423 --> 00:25:50.319
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:52.410
and the ostinatos of course.
 

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:57.068
Percussion, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:25:57.068 --> 00:26:00.528
dissonance, more dissonance,
&gt;

00:26:00.528 --> 00:26:03.510
brasses as percussion
instruments, &lt;&lt;music

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.588
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:26:04.588 --> 00:26:07.509
more percussion,
pounding dissonance.

00:26:07.509 --> 00:26:09.338
&gt;
 

00:26:09.338 --> 00:26:12.736
And a lot of Modern music has a
kind of intensity to it:

00:26:12.736 --> 00:26:13.415
"Stop.
 

00:26:13.415 --> 00:26:14.403
I give up."
 

00:26:14.403 --> 00:26:14.960
Okay?
 

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.880
"I surrender."
 

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:17.509
It's got that element to it.
 

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:22.377
There's an intensity to it here
so that could be even a fifth

00:26:22.377 --> 00:26:24.650
component in our thinking.
 

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.299
So all of this leads us to the
conclusion that this is a piece

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:31.471
of twentieth-century music by
the woman composer Ellen

00:26:31.471 --> 00:26:34.025
Zwilich,
and you have Ellen Zwilich of

00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:37.454
course as the basis of your
Listening Exercise forty-five

00:26:37.454 --> 00:26:38.680
that you've done.
 

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.920
This is simply another piece
called "Celebration."

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:44.836
It's a pretty--so far a pretty
intense celebration by Ellen

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:49.176
Zwilich written in 1984,
so it's a fairly recent piece

00:26:49.176 --> 00:26:52.130
of music in the Modernist
style--

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.038
not Post-modernist,
but Modernist.

00:26:54.038 --> 00:26:54.402
Okay.
 

00:26:54.402 --> 00:26:58.318
Well, I'm going to--I think
variety is always useful in

00:26:58.318 --> 00:26:58.900
life.
 

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.598
I'm going to--and I asked Lynda
yesterday,

00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:02.920
"Lynda,
you prepare a piece and--

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.729
but don't tell me what it is
'cause I want to go through the

00:27:05.729 --> 00:27:08.298
same thought processes that
other people have."

00:27:08.298 --> 00:27:11.212
So Lynda has prepared a piece,
and I don't know whether she's

00:27:11.212 --> 00:27:13.884
going to use the piano or
whether she's going to use the

00:27:13.884 --> 00:27:14.710
audio player.
 

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:24.490
 
 

00:27:24.490 --> 00:28:03.920
&gt;
 

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.009
Lynda: What are you
hearing?

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:09.539
Who has any thoughts on this?
 

00:28:09.539 --> 00:28:10.750
Student: Regular meter.
 

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.220
Lynda: Regular meter.
 

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.190
All right, that's a very good,
important point for this

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.940
particular meter.
 

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:20.750
What else?
 

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.640
What kinds of instruments?
 

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.640
Student: A lot of
strings in the foreground.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.132
Lynda: Uh huh,
strings in the foreground,

00:28:32.132 --> 00:28:35.402
so this means we have,
probably, an orchestra

00:28:35.402 --> 00:28:37.259
of--what--well,
okay.

00:28:37.259 --> 00:28:38.160
Before we get there--okay.
 

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.808
Strings in the foreground in
this particular ensemble.

00:28:40.808 --> 00:28:44.140
Can anybody tell us what the
solo instrument was?

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:45.259
Student:  Bassoon.
 

00:28:45.259 --> 00:28:46.490
Lynda:  Right, bassoon!
 

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:47.962
Prof:
&gt;

00:28:47.962 --> 00:28:48.786
What a coincidence.
 

00:28:48.786 --> 00:28:49.868
&gt;
 

00:28:49.868 --> 00:28:52.412
Lynda: So we've got
regular meter,

00:28:52.412 --> 00:28:55.400
strings in the foreground,
a solo instrument.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.964
What might you say about the
relationship between the solo

00:28:59.964 --> 00:29:03.009
instrument and the bigger
ensembles?

00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:06.680
I think it may be pretty
obvious but--

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:15.990
Student: I guess
&gt;

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.044
Lynda: That's true.
 

00:29:17.044 --> 00:29:18.828
There seems to be at about a
similar level.

00:29:18.828 --> 00:29:22.565
It doesn't seem like the
ensemble is very big and you

00:29:22.565 --> 00:29:25.509
have them playing one after the
other,

00:29:25.509 --> 00:29:30.118
which is a characteristic of
something that we learned about.

00:29:30.118 --> 00:29:34.204
Rhythmically,
this goes with meter,

00:29:34.204 --> 00:29:37.450
is it regular,
irregular?

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.650
Pretty regular.
 

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:43.190
You could tap your foot to it.
 

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.380
You could hear a melody.
 

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.690
I'll just play a couple more
seconds.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:30:11.170
&gt;
 

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:16.316
So the solo instrument is
playing something kind of simple

00:30:16.316 --> 00:30:20.380
or something kind of virtuosic,
impressive?

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.868
It's pretty impressive.
 

00:30:22.868 --> 00:30:25.239
You should hear lots of little
trills and weeping all over the

00:30:25.239 --> 00:30:25.548
place?
 

00:30:25.548 --> 00:30:29.279
It's showing off and this is a
feature of something we learned

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:29.769
about.
 

00:30:29.769 --> 00:30:37.009
So who would like to guess what
period we're in--

00:30:37.009 --> 00:30:37.740
Student: Romantic
&gt;

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.799
Lynda:  Close,
yeah.

00:30:39.799 --> 00:30:44.159
Yeah, I guess I can see why you
might--why might you say

00:30:44.159 --> 00:30:45.190
Romantic?
 

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.288
Student:
&gt;

00:30:49.288 --> 00:30:52.025
Lynda: Which makes me
realize that it can't always

00:30:52.025 --> 00:30:53.538
fall inside of the orchestra.
 

00:30:53.538 --> 00:30:57.366
Sometimes it's better to listen
for some of the more abstract

00:30:57.366 --> 00:31:00.430
features, such as what the
orchestra is doing.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.278
The harmonies,
how about the harmonic

00:31:03.278 --> 00:31:04.150
language?
 

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:08.650
Is it pretty surprising or a
little more expected?

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.134
Maybe it's just--maybe it's
something that's going to help

00:31:12.134 --> 00:31:14.088
you zero in a little bit more.
 

00:31:14.088 --> 00:31:19.919
Yeah, pretty expected,
not very surprising harmonies

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:25.698
Does anybody else have another--
Student:

00:31:25.698 --> 00:31:30.548
&gt;
 

00:31:30.548 --> 00:31:35.190
Lynda: Little bows tied
up at the end of a phrase.

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.660
What does that suggest to you?
 

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:39.740
Student: A cadence.
 

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:40.992
Lynda: A cadence.
 

00:31:40.992 --> 00:31:42.769
Very good,
&gt;

00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:48.049
which is very strong in what
period?

00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:48.440
Student: Classical.
 

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:49.900
Lynda: Classical. Yeah.
 

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.493
These things do happen in other
periods, but this is sort of a

00:31:53.493 --> 00:31:56.440
quintessential classical,
very particular genre.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:32:00.809
Does anybody know what genre
we're in?

00:32:00.809 --> 00:32:01.259
Student: Concerto.
 

00:32:01.259 --> 00:32:02.342
Lynda: Concerto.
 

00:32:02.342 --> 00:32:04.553
Exactly, so this would be
Mozart's "Bassoon

00:32:04.553 --> 00:32:05.400
Concerto."
 

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.519
Who knew that Mozart wrote a
bassoon concerto?

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:11.096
It's one of the bassoonist's
biggest pieces in the

00:32:11.096 --> 00:32:11.778
repertoire.
 

00:32:11.778 --> 00:32:14.009
He felt the bassoon was sort of
amusing instrument;

00:32:14.009 --> 00:32:15.720
that's why he wrote a lot of
leaps in it.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:17.440
He felt it sounded like a clown.
 

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.528
Anyway, so that's a concerto
example for you which is not

00:32:22.528 --> 00:32:23.981
piano or violin.
 

00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:24.710
Yeah.
 

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:27.372
Student: What is the
main difference between Romantic

00:32:27.372 --> 00:32:28.230
and Classical?
 

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:30.009
Lynda: That is a great
question.

00:32:30.009 --> 00:32:33.890
I wonder if I ought to defer to
Professor Wright.

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:36.049
Prof: Well,
let's work through this

00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.630
together.
 

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:39.019
One we have been all over this
morning,

00:32:39.019 --> 00:32:40.529
and that is the size of the
orchestra,

00:32:40.529 --> 00:32:42.982
and we talked when we had the
lecture on nineteenth-century

00:32:42.982 --> 00:32:45.267
orchestral music,
how all of these instruments

00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:45.730
come in.
 

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:49.013
So in Romantic music the
orchestra has many more and many

00:32:49.013 --> 00:32:52.709
varied instruments in it ranging
from top piccolo down to middle

00:32:52.709 --> 00:32:55.288
English horn down to bottom
contrabass,

00:32:55.288 --> 00:32:57.058
bassoon, tuba and things like
that.

00:32:57.058 --> 00:32:59.586
So it's the orchestra,
particularly low brasses and

00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:02.236
that kind of sound,
that typifies the sound

00:33:02.236 --> 00:33:06.108
generally for orchestral music
in the nineteenth century.

00:33:06.108 --> 00:33:10.170
Then, whereas Daniel was
talking about bow tie,

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.960
they're tied together,
you don't--what he was

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.763
intimating there perhaps was
that we have this kind of paired

00:33:16.763 --> 00:33:20.377
phrasing or neat little units of
phrasing that can be tied

00:33:20.377 --> 00:33:21.328
together.
 

00:33:21.328 --> 00:33:23.818
That's a component of Classical
music.

00:33:23.818 --> 00:33:25.650
As you go into the Romantic
period,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:30.190
the themes, the melodies,
become much more expansive,

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:33.808
and someone I think said
earlier on here it has--

00:33:33.808 --> 00:33:37.301
maybe the first point was
there's pretty regular meter in

00:33:37.301 --> 00:33:40.670
this particular piece of
Classical music by Mozart,

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:42.855
the "Mozart Bassoon
Concerto,"

00:33:42.855 --> 00:33:42.967
K.
 

00:33:42.967 --> 00:33:43.359
191.
 

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:44.200
Is that right?
 

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:48.578
And so the regularity of the
themes and the balance and

00:33:48.578 --> 00:33:52.960
symmetry is part and parcel of
the Classical period.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.328
You move into the Romantic.
 

00:33:54.328 --> 00:33:58.363
You have expansive themes,
but by way of contradistinction

00:33:58.363 --> 00:34:00.403
there,
then the rhythm becomes not

00:34:00.403 --> 00:34:02.586
necessarily more flaccid,
but more loose,

00:34:02.586 --> 00:34:04.922
and we talked about this
phenomenon of rubato,

00:34:04.922 --> 00:34:05.700
for example.
 

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.702
So flexible rhythms,
flexible tempos,

00:34:08.702 --> 00:34:12.289
less clear meters in the
Romantic period.

00:34:12.289 --> 00:34:15.568
And, not to overdo it,
but maybe this idea of just

00:34:15.568 --> 00:34:19.246
"beautiful melody,"
and it is of course in the

00:34:19.246 --> 00:34:23.128
nineteenth century that we get
the whole idea of the bel

00:34:23.128 --> 00:34:24.599
canto sound.
 

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:27.840
Anybody read
Rothstein's--no--Anthony

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:32.610
Tommasini's article that I
pointed you to about bel

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:33.869
canto?
 

00:34:33.869 --> 00:34:37.735
He said, "Actually,
the beginning of that starts

00:34:37.735 --> 00:34:42.271
back with the composers of piano
music of that same period and

00:34:42.271 --> 00:34:46.360
then the opera composers begin
to go into it."

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.280
So who wrote this?
 

00:34:47.280 --> 00:35:22.329
&gt;
 

00:35:22.329 --> 00:35:23.682
A lovely melody,
huh?

00:35:23.682 --> 00:35:25.239
Isn't that beautiful?
 

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:27.454
Well, the whole idea of
beautiful melody--yeah,

00:35:27.454 --> 00:35:29.719
Mozart wrote a lot of beautiful
melodies too.

00:35:29.719 --> 00:35:30.449
So did Bach.
 

00:35:30.449 --> 00:35:33.021
But somehow,
"beautiful melody,"

00:35:33.021 --> 00:35:36.282
this warm, rich melody,
is very important in Romantic

00:35:36.282 --> 00:35:36.909
music.
 

00:35:36.909 --> 00:35:39.010
So this is a good example of
&gt;

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:44.409
kind of rich harmonies,
a broader palette and--than the

00:35:44.409 --> 00:35:46.309
classical period.
 

00:35:46.309 --> 00:35:50.409
I could play one other piece
here just to differentiate

00:35:50.409 --> 00:35:53.369
Romantic piano music from this
sound.

00:35:53.369 --> 00:36:47.090
&gt;
 

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:48.659
So that's a piece by Mozart.
 

00:36:48.659 --> 00:36:51.230
You could say that the melody
is just as beautiful.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.389
That's a gorgeous melody too.
 

00:36:52.389 --> 00:36:53.230
That's lovely.
 

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.692
You could use that as film
music just as well as you could

00:36:55.692 --> 00:36:56.469
the other piece.
 

00:36:56.469 --> 00:37:02.818
So the first piece that I
played &lt;&lt;plays

00:37:02.818 --> 00:37:04.652
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:37:04.652 --> 00:37:08.039
&gt;
 

00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:11.902
is by--any takers on that,
who--piano music of the

00:37:11.902 --> 00:37:13.559
nineteenth century?
 

00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:17.309
Anybody--if you've peeked
through the textbook--Thaddeus.

00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:18.289
Student: Chopin.
 

00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:19.751
Prof: Good.
 

00:37:19.751 --> 00:37:23.079
Yeah, Chopin--Frederic Chopin,
so that's a

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:27.543
classic--quintessential moment
of Chopin that's become a

00:37:27.543 --> 00:37:28.599
classic.
 

00:37:28.599 --> 00:37:32.168
Indeed it became a kind of--
Judy Garland used to sing this,

00:37:32.168 --> 00:37:34.768
"I'm Forever Chasing
Rainbows."

00:37:34.768 --> 00:37:39.969
It got turned into a pop song
in the twentieth century because

00:37:39.969 --> 00:37:43.550
it's such a drop-dead beautiful
melody,

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.175
but the difference here is
the--in the pianos the terms of

00:37:46.175 --> 00:37:46.730
expansion.
 

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.309
Here is the Chopin sound
&gt;.

00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:54.541
Here is the--and the chords,
sometime they go &lt;&lt;plays

00:37:54.541 --> 00:37:55.713
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:37:55.713 --> 00:38:00.675
, sort of interesting harmonic
shifts, but the Mozart by

00:38:00.675 --> 00:38:05.184
comparison is very plain
harmonically &lt;&lt;plays

00:38:05.184 --> 00:38:06.989
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:38:06.989 --> 00:38:10.338
and very limited in terms of
the range and limited somewhat

00:38:10.338 --> 00:38:11.840
in terms of the texture.
 

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.510
What kind of bass is this?
 

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:16.139
We're talking about how we
identify style.

00:38:16.139 --> 00:38:18.858
All you really have to do is
listen to about one second of

00:38:18.858 --> 00:38:20.530
this &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.010
Well, I know what that is.
 

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:23.460
That has to be what?
 

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.210
Emily.
 

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.159
Student: Alberti.

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:30.320
Prof: That's an Alberti
bass and Alberti bass is used

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.409
only in what period of music
history?

00:38:32.409 --> 00:38:34.300
Classical. Okay?
 

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:38.407
So you hear that and it's got
to be in a forty-year period,

00:38:38.407 --> 00:38:42.730
roughly 1770 to 1810 or so,
and then they stopped using it.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:46.119
How do you know that this is
specifically Mozart?

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:47.730
This is above and beyond the
pale.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.130
The--if put down Beethoven for
this, it'd be great.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.768
If you put down Haydn for this
it would be great;

00:38:51.768 --> 00:38:52.809
Schubert for this would be
great;

00:38:52.809 --> 00:38:54.590
Mozart for this it would be
great.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:55.789
How we do know it's Mozart?
 

00:38:55.789 --> 00:39:03.670
There's one little moment here
&gt;

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.320
that when he takes that line
and nobody else would have

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.349
&gt;.
 

00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:10.510
He loves to do that.
 

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:11.250
What did he do there?
 

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:14.250
He inserted what?
 

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.150
&gt;
 

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.559
What kind of scale is that?
 

00:39:17.559 --> 00:39:19.119
&gt;
 

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:19.969
Yeah.
 

00:39:19.969 --> 00:39:20.989
Emily says chromatic.
 

00:39:20.989 --> 00:39:25.019
So he inserted just a little
bit of chromaticism there and

00:39:25.019 --> 00:39:27.989
that's a fingerprint of Mozart
so that--

00:39:27.989 --> 00:39:31.409
we're parsing this out a little
bit more fine than we need do,

00:39:31.409 --> 00:39:33.489
but that's the--kind of the
next step on this.

00:39:33.489 --> 00:39:35.420
Okay.
 

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.420
Where are we?
 

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:38.360
Let's do one more piece.
 

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:47.369
 
 

00:39:47.369 --> 00:39:51.851
Anybody want to ask a question
while we're queuing this up?

00:39:51.851 --> 00:39:52.469
Oscar.
 

00:39:52.469 --> 00:40:04.231
Student: Just the idea
of the use of ostinato music in

00:40:04.231 --> 00:40:06.780
Modern music.
 

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:12.268
&gt;
 

00:40:12.268 --> 00:40:15.498
Prof: Beethoven wouldn't
really use so much of an

00:40:15.498 --> 00:40:17.789
ostinato as he would just sit
there--

00:40:17.789 --> 00:40:20.630
I see your point though--on one
chord and kind of hammer you

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:25.650
over the head with that,
but I--that's an--it's a good

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:26.550
point.
 

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:30.005
It's more sophisticated in a
way that we need get into in

00:40:30.005 --> 00:40:33.400
here, but I wouldn't say
Beethoven uses ostinato so much

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.449
as iteration.
 

00:40:34.449 --> 00:40:38.105
And admittedly it's a fine line
between ostinato and iteration

00:40:38.105 --> 00:40:41.579
but kind of sitting on something
and just kind of repeating

00:40:41.579 --> 00:40:43.829
that--
maybe that chord--over and over

00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:46.489
and over again in a way that
Mozart or Schubert,

00:40:46.489 --> 00:40:50.460
being fundamentally
constructors of melody,

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.579
wouldn't necessarily do.
 

00:40:52.579 --> 00:40:58.400
Student:
&gt;

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.804
Prof: Okay.
 

00:40:59.804 --> 00:41:01.289
Yeah, that's true.
 

00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:06.389
You could look upon the--that
&gt;

00:41:06.389 --> 00:41:09.746
as an ostinato,
but people don't normally do

00:41:09.746 --> 00:41:12.789
that, but that's just fine and
dandy.

00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:17.943
It may be something particular
to Beethoven rather than the era

00:41:17.943 --> 00:41:21.516
generally, but yes,
you're right about that,

00:41:21.516 --> 00:41:23.179
so good for you.
 

00:41:23.179 --> 00:41:26.190
Oscar: one, Craig:
nothing at this point.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.809
Any other question?
 

00:41:28.809 --> 00:41:29.750
All right. Let's go on.
 

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.041
We'll hear one last piece and
then I'll let you go although

00:41:32.041 --> 00:41:33.030
it's a fairly long one.
 

00:41:33.030 --> 00:42:27.050
 
 

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.980
Any other questions as
we--Angela, go ahead.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:37.820
Student:
&gt;

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.724
Prof: Well,
you could use him as a swing

00:42:41.724 --> 00:42:42.489
player.
 

00:42:42.489 --> 00:42:44.123
In other words,
if you hear a piece that you

00:42:44.123 --> 00:42:46.367
think is Beethoven and you put
that down as Classical that's

00:42:46.367 --> 00:42:46.710
fine.
 

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.690
If you put that down as
Romantic, that's fine too.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:56.139
 
 

00:42:56.139 --> 00:43:58.260
&gt;
 

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:02.231
Now there should be one thing
there that's a dead giveaway in

00:44:02.231 --> 00:44:04.813
terms of period,
and what would that be?

00:44:04.813 --> 00:44:05.409
Zach.
 

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:05.909
Student: The harpsichord.
 

00:44:05.909 --> 00:44:09.289
Prof: The harpsichord,
okay, because we've said before

00:44:09.289 --> 00:44:12.500
that really the harpsichord
doesn't get much in the way of

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:15.655
legs in the history of music
until the Baroque period and

00:44:15.655 --> 00:44:18.809
then it disappears as it's
replaced by the piano,

00:44:18.809 --> 00:44:21.289
for the most part,
in the Classical period.

00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:24.474
So the Baroque period is
all--it can be readily

00:44:24.474 --> 00:44:28.630
identified here simply by the
presence of the harpsichord.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:32.130
But what else did we hear in
these admittedly very short

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:32.829
excerpts?
 

00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:36.190
Well, let's go back to the
beginning, then,

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:38.349
and listen to the rhythm.
 

00:44:38.349 --> 00:44:46.800
&gt;
 

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.260
Could you dance or march to
this?

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:57.070
&gt;
 

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:00.699
It sounds like almost a pompous
entry of some kind.

00:45:00.699 --> 00:45:03.365
You can see the king coming in
to court or something

00:45:03.365 --> 00:45:05.039
&gt;.
 

00:45:05.039 --> 00:45:09.643
So, highly regular rhythm here,
and this rhythm and this

00:45:09.643 --> 00:45:14.164
particular sound goes on and
goes unchanged for about a

00:45:14.164 --> 00:45:17.679
minute and thirty-five seconds
or so,

00:45:17.679 --> 00:45:21.215
and that's another aspect of
this--not only regular rhythm

00:45:21.215 --> 00:45:24.750
but a regular ethos in the music
of the Baroque period.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:29.110
Now let's listen to this last
component here and then we'll

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.389
stop with this.
 

00:45:30.389 --> 00:45:33.550
 
 

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:55.099
&gt;
 

00:45:55.099 --> 00:45:58.902
So what are we hearing here and
why is this further evidence of

00:45:58.902 --> 00:46:01.112
music coming from the Baroque
period?

00:46:01.112 --> 00:46:01.909
Mary Pat.
 

00:46:01.909 --> 00:46:02.400
Student: It's a fugue.
 

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.349
Prof: It's a fugue,
okay, and we studied the fugue

00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:08.670
and we said the fugue came into
being in the Baroque period,

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:11.409
principally under the aegis of
J.S. Bach.

00:46:11.409 --> 00:46:15.152
So there we've got our four
bullet points or four pieces of

00:46:15.152 --> 00:46:18.574
supporting evidence for the
conclusion that we came to

00:46:18.574 --> 00:46:21.054
rather early on,
as Zach pointed out,

00:46:21.054 --> 00:46:23.420
by the presence of the
harpsichord there.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.760
Any final questions before we
stop?

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.670
If not, I have a request.
 

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:31.365
You may have heard that
unfortunately our good friend,

00:46:31.365 --> 00:46:33.655
Richard Lalli,
has had a serious medical issue

00:46:33.655 --> 00:46:35.079
that he is dealing with.
 

00:46:35.079 --> 00:46:37.873
And he was--he is always such a
wonderful guy and this was going

00:46:37.873 --> 00:46:39.469
to be the highlight of his
career.

00:46:39.469 --> 00:46:42.898
He was going to take over the
mastership of Jonathan Edwards

00:46:42.898 --> 00:46:45.340
College and unfortunately this
happened.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.567
So I'd be very grateful to
you--and we've got a couple of

00:46:48.567 --> 00:46:51.737
get well cards out there and
Richard is always very much

00:46:51.737 --> 00:46:55.737
interested in our Yale students,
and it would be great if on the

00:46:55.737 --> 00:46:57.795
way out,
you would be good enough to

00:46:57.795 --> 00:47:00.869
sign your name there on those
cards and we'll be sure that

00:47:00.869 --> 00:47:02.380
they get over to Richard.
 

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:02.849
Okay.
 

00:47:02.849 --> 00:47:07.356
Thanks very much and I'll see
you next Wednesday,

00:47:07.356 --> 00:47:09.329
six days from now.
 

00:47:09.329 --> 00:47:15.000

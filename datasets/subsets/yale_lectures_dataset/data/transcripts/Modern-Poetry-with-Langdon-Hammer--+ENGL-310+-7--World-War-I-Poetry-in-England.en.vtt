00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.556
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Let's turn to page

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:26.364
527 in your anthology where you
find a famous poem by Wilfred

00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:31.440
Owen called "Dulce et Decorum
Est."

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.699
And your footnote explains that
that phrase is the beginning of

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.711
a line from Horace,
completed at the end of the

00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:47.636
poem – that is,
in the last lines of the poem

00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:51.920
– "pro patria mori":
translated as,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.628
"It is sweet and proper";
sweet and right,

00:00:56.628 --> 00:01:02.979
decorous – "to die for one's
country."

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.790
Bent double,
like old beggars under sacks,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.066
Knock-kneed,
coughing like hags,

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.420
we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.847
turned our backs
And towards our distant rest

00:01:18.847 --> 00:01:24.950
began to trudge.
Men marched asleep.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.840
Many had lost their boots
But limped on, blood-shod.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.460
All went lame;
all blind;

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.510
Drunk with fatigue;
deaf even to the hoots

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.130
Of tired, outstripped
Five-Nines that dropped behind.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.190
Gas!
Gas!

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.400
Quick, boys!--An ecstasy of
fumbling,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.860
Fitting the clumsy helmets just
in time;

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.659
But someone still was yelling
out and stumbling

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.710
And floundering like a man in
fire or lime…

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.379
Dim, through the misty panes
and thick green light,

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:19.389
As under a green sea,
I saw him drowning.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.470
In all my dreams,
before my helpless sight,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.004
He plunges at me,
guttering, choking,

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:32.064
drowning.
If in some smothering dreams

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:35.979
you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.632
him in,
And watch the white eyes

00:02:38.632 --> 00:02:42.314
writhing in his face,
His hanging face,

00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:46.714
like a devil's sick of sin;
If you could hear,

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:48.789
at every jolt,
the blood

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.629
Come gargling from the
froth-corrupted lungs,

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.139
Obscene as cancer,
bitter as the cud

00:02:55.139 --> 00:03:00.650
Of vile, incurable sores on
innocent tongues,--

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.719
My friend, you would not tell
with such high zest

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:09.990
To children ardent for some
desperate glory,

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.750
The old Lie:
Dulce et decorum est

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.800
Pro patria mori.
 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.449
 
 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:26.417
Paul Fussell,
a literary critic who wrote a

00:03:26.417 --> 00:03:33.948
brilliant book about the
literature and culture of the

00:03:33.948 --> 00:03:39.816
First World War,
speaks of irony as the

00:03:39.816 --> 00:03:46.833
essential trope or rhetorical
figure of this body of

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:51.530
literature,
World War One poetry.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.759
Here is, in this poem,
an example of irony,

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.740
of a really comparatively
simple kind.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.791
What are schoolboy lines from
Horace, lines that Owen and many

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:14.340
others would have learned in
school to recite,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:22.377
to have memorized--that poetry
is here held up as propaganda,

00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:29.878
as a kind of murderous lie:
"it is sweet and right to die

00:04:29.878 --> 00:04:32.959
for one's country."
 

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:39.766
You can feel it in the
marvelous texture of this

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:44.967
poetry.
Against Horace's decorous and

00:04:44.967 --> 00:04:49.806
elegant Latin,
there is placed Owen's

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:58.107
Anglo-Saxon alliterative,
inflected, strongly stressed

00:04:58.107 --> 00:05:07.019
language with its rough and
actual vernacular diction.

00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:15.838
The power and authority,
too, of Owen's writing is,

00:05:15.838 --> 00:05:20.600
well, certified,
we feel,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.392
by that first person that
speaks to us,

00:05:25.392 --> 00:05:30.689
that "I" who speaks as a
witness to war,

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:36.825
as a describer,
as someone telling a reader

00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:45.444
elsewhere what he has seen and
speaking specifically for one

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:52.105
fallen soldier.
The reception of Owen's poetry

00:05:52.105 --> 00:05:59.748
has always been attached to a
sense of Owen as a soldier and

00:05:59.748 --> 00:06:05.838
witness to war,
and indeed as a victim of war,

00:06:05.838 --> 00:06:10.600
who died a week before the
Armistice.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.510
These poems that you see the
cover for here,

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:25.224
Poems by Wilfred Owen,
originally appeared

00:06:25.224 --> 00:06:33.754
posthumously after Owen's death,
introduced by Siegfried Sassoon

00:06:33.754 --> 00:06:36.056
– a comrade,
fellow poet,

00:06:36.056 --> 00:06:40.280
fellow soldier.
And as you can see,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.573
in addition to the
introduction,

00:06:44.573 --> 00:06:52.050
the cover advertises also a
portrait of the author.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:58.144
And there is Owen,
in uniform, a handsome young

00:06:58.144 --> 00:07:00.296
man.
This is all,

00:07:00.296 --> 00:07:07.420
as I say, very much part of the
transmission of Owen's poetry.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:14.172
"Dulce et Decorum Est" is a
great poem but the kind of irony

00:07:14.172 --> 00:07:19.780
that it puts forward is,
I think, a simple one.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.139
It is, well, it's a great poem.
 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:27.671
There are lots of them that
when I first started teaching

00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:30.990
this course I decided I wouldn't
teach.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:37.086
And for a number of reasons
including the sense that,

00:07:37.086 --> 00:07:42.947
gee, Yeats, Stevens,
Eliot – these are hard poets

00:07:42.947 --> 00:07:50.450
and we need as much time on them
as we can in order to read their

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.058
work.
And this poem seemed like one

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:59.979
you might find and be able to
read yourself,

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:03.870
without me there to explain it.
 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.700
It also is the case that
probably many of you have

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.313
already read it and possibly
studied it in school and talked

00:08:12.313 --> 00:08:14.710
about it.
So, at any rate,

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:19.199
this seemed to me to be,
when I started teaching this

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:22.220
course, reasons not to teach it.
 

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:28.989
Besides, well,
I think the first time I taught

00:08:28.989 --> 00:08:35.909
this course was a few years
after the Gulf War,

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:43.096
the first Gulf War;
and it seemed to me,

00:08:43.096 --> 00:08:53.157
in my historical innocence,
that the irony that Owen is

00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:59.404
playing upon here,
that he's putting forward to

00:08:59.404 --> 00:09:03.656
us, was not one that I would
need to talk about in a

00:09:03.656 --> 00:09:07.487
classroom.
It seemed to me as though no

00:09:07.487 --> 00:09:13.180
one would ever quote Horace
again, as anything but a lie.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.110
Of course that's not the case.
 

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:24.427
You know, as our present war
has gone on, how many times have

00:09:24.427 --> 00:09:31.358
we heard people in many
different forms speaking of

00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:39.260
justifications for the deaths of
young men and women,

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.639
on behalf of the nation?
 

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:51.661
Well, as we watch our
President's approval ratings for

00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:58.469
his conduct of the war drop,
one wonders:

00:09:58.469 --> 00:10:06.639
could any of us really be
surprised by this?

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:11.300
And certainly Wilfred Owen
would not have been,

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:17.480
and it seemed to me as though
in fact it was important to read

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:23.052
Wilfred Owen and to go on
thinking and talking about his

00:10:23.052 --> 00:10:26.742
poetry.
And not only Owen,

00:10:26.742 --> 00:10:33.463
of course, but really the
extraordinary rich body of

00:10:33.463 --> 00:10:39.129
British World War One poetry as
a whole,

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:43.789
writing that is not by any
means all about battle,

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:48.639
though much of it is,
like that poem I just read.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:55.899
Today what I want to do is give
you some sense of this body of

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:59.149
writing.
And unlike the last few

00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:04.612
lectures where I've concentrated
on a single poet and tried to

00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:09.269
make arguments about that poet
and have a thesis,

00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:13.363
today what I want to do is
really just show you different

00:11:13.363 --> 00:11:21.190
poems and different poets,
a range of brilliant writing.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:27.456
In addition to an opportunity
to think about poetry and war,

00:11:27.456 --> 00:11:33.934
it's also a good opportunity to
start to fill out a little bit

00:11:33.934 --> 00:11:38.820
our sense of what modern poetry
is or was,

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:47.169
what it is or was;
also, what it did not become.

00:11:47.169 --> 00:11:53.070
World War One destroyed an
English generation.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:57.470
 
 

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.904
Modern poetry,
as we study it in this class

00:12:01.904 --> 00:12:05.493
and, I think,
as you see it in this

00:12:05.493 --> 00:12:10.350
anthology, is an international
phenomenon.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:15.762
It's not--Well,
we don't have a lot of English

00:12:15.762 --> 00:12:18.769
poets on this syllabus.
 

00:12:18.769 --> 00:12:23.420
There's T.S.
Eliot, the only great English

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.029
poet born in America.
 

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:31.904
There's W.H.
Auden, an English-born poet who

00:12:31.904 --> 00:12:34.500
moved to America.
 

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.310
Most of the figures that we
study are in fact Americans.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.690
There's Yeats, too.
 

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:45.240
All of them are in a sense
internationals.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:51.294
And there's a range of
important cultural reasons for

00:12:51.294 --> 00:12:54.159
this.
But there's also the simple

00:12:54.159 --> 00:12:58.781
fact of the war.
Arguably, the great modern

00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:06.470
English poets died in the teens,
in France in 1915 or 1917,

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:13.602
or they survived – like Ivor
Gurney, whom you have some

00:13:13.602 --> 00:13:19.970
samples from – in a wounded
and injured state.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:27.807
I also think it's important for
us to think about the war as an

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:35.139
important context when we go on
to read Pound and Eliot,

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:42.833
when we encounter in their
poetry a sense of apocalyptic

00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:47.870
change, of civilization in
crisis,

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:51.029
which can seem pretty vague
sometimes.

00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:55.449
Well, and this is true for the
Yeats poems that we've been

00:13:55.449 --> 00:13:57.309
talking about as well.
 

00:13:57.309 --> 00:14:01.830
Yeats is obviously writing in
the context of an Irish civil

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.585
war, but it's also the case that
he's writing in the shadow of

00:14:06.585 --> 00:14:09.080
the First World War as well.
 

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:19.126
On July 1,1916,
more than 57,000 English troops

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:24.149
were wounded or dead.
 

00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:31.760
I think almost 20,000 on that
day died, and in the Battle of

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:37.695
the Somme, as it unfolded,
there were a million

00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:42.976
casualties.
This is a scale of human

00:14:42.976 --> 00:14:49.390
suffering and a kind of,
well, a scale of human

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:56.779
suffering that is enormous and
hard to comprehend,

00:14:56.779 --> 00:15:01.831
and leaves its shadow across
the writing that we will be

00:15:01.831 --> 00:15:05.802
reading.
All the poets we will be

00:15:05.802 --> 00:15:11.756
talking about today are men;
not quite all soldiers,

00:15:11.756 --> 00:15:13.529
but most of them.
 

00:15:13.529 --> 00:15:18.858
I've given you some quotes from
Virginia Woolf,

00:15:18.858 --> 00:15:26.039
partly to remind us that the
war did not only exist for men,

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:32.471
or soldiers,
and that it existed in England

00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:38.750
as much as it existed on the
continent.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:46.778
Well, with all that said by
preparation, let me show you

00:15:46.778 --> 00:15:53.200
some more poems,
beginning with Thomas Hardy,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.390
on page 51.
 

00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:02.320
 
 

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:12.172
This is a little pamphlet of
war poems Hardy published in

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:20.090
1917 and that you can find in
the Beinecke.

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.416
Hardy, arguably the greatest
English poet,

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:29.586
modern English poet,
is a figure we don't study in

00:16:29.586 --> 00:16:32.330
this course otherwise.
 

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.580
He is a poet from another
century.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.653
He's born, in fact,
twenty years before the

00:16:38.653 --> 00:16:40.190
American Civil War.
 

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.480
 
 

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:48.740
When World War One began he was
seventy-four.

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:56.309
He wrote his poems from the
perspective of rural England.

00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:59.993
It was the setting for almost
all of his novels,

00:16:59.993 --> 00:17:02.110
almost all of his poetry.
 

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.872
And "Channel Firing," on the
bottom of 51,

00:17:06.872 --> 00:17:11.170
is also set in the west of
England,

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:17.816
Hardy's home country,
and is set right on the verge

00:17:17.816 --> 00:17:21.140
of the First World War.
 

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.680
It's a poem about gunnery
practice.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:32.034
Yes, it's a dramatic monologue
spoken by one of the dead,

00:17:32.034 --> 00:17:36.076
in a graveyard:
That night your great

00:17:36.076 --> 00:17:39.670
guns, unawares,
Shook all our coffins as we lay,

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:41.670
And broke the chancel
window-squares,

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:44.740
We thought it was the
Judgment-day

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:46.040
And sat upright.
 

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.769
 
 

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:57.519
[Hardy has various gothic and
supernatural fancies that

00:17:57.519 --> 00:18:01.905
he asks us to imagine in vivid,
homely terms.]

00:18:01.905 --> 00:18:06.394
While drearisome
Arose the howl of wakened

00:18:06.394 --> 00:18:12.299
hounds: [This is all this
wonderful, observed detail of

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.480
rural life.]
The mouse let fall the

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:18.505
altar-crumb,
The worms drew back into the

00:18:18.505 --> 00:18:22.210
mounds,
The glebe cow drooled.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:28.548
Till God called, 'No;
It's gunnery practice out at

00:18:28.548 --> 00:18:31.509
sea.
Just as before you went below;

00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:36.074
The world is as it used to be:
[This is not "The Second

00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:39.035
Coming."
Kind of a reply to Yeats,

00:18:39.035 --> 00:18:42.589
although Yeats has written his
poem yet.]

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:45.070
'All nations striving strong to
make

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:47.260
Red war yet redder.
 

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.974
Mad as hatters
They do no more for Christés

00:18:49.974 --> 00:18:53.279
sake
Than you who are helpless in

00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:55.592
such matters.
'That this is not the

00:18:55.592 --> 00:18:58.220
judgment-hour
For some of them's a blessed

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.438
thing,
For if it were they'd have to

00:19:00.438 --> 00:19:02.541
scour
Hell's floor for so much

00:19:02.541 --> 00:19:07.740
threatening….
'Ha, ha.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.944
[Hardy's God laughs like that.
 

00:19:10.944 --> 00:19:14.470
Frost would have understood
it.]

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:18.600
It will be warmer when
I blow the trumpet (if indeed

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.060
I ever do;
for you are men,

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:22.589
And rest eternal sorely need).'
 

00:19:22.589 --> 00:19:26.372
[This is God,
so cruel that he will not

00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:31.350
deliver the Second Coming,
the Day of Judgment.]

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.450
So down we lay again.
 

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:37.650
'I wonder,
Will the world ever saner be,'

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.020
Said one, 'than when He sent us
under

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:43.329
In our indifferent century!'
 

00:19:43.329 --> 00:19:46.279
And many a skeleton shook his
head.

00:19:46.279 --> 00:19:49.640
'Instead of preaching forty
year,'

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.763
My neighbor Parson Thirdly said,
'I wish I had stuck to pipes

00:19:53.763 --> 00:19:57.207
and beer.'
Again the guns disturbed the

00:19:57.207 --> 00:19:59.756
hour,
Roaring their readiness to

00:19:59.756 --> 00:20:03.269
avenge,
As far inland as Stourton Tower,

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:09.269
And Camelot,
and starlit Stonehenge.

00:20:09.269 --> 00:20:16.569
Gunnery practice disturbs the
dead, disrupts the ground.

00:20:16.569 --> 00:20:21.599
Here, war refuses to let the
dead lie in peace,

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:27.613
with the notion that not even
the dead are safe from it,

00:20:27.613 --> 00:20:29.910
unaffected by it.
 

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.119
The church windows shatter.
 

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:38.447
Well, in some sense this is
exactly what modernity might be

00:20:38.447 --> 00:20:43.039
seen to be doing to traditional
English culture.

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:48.910
Hardy is full of all those
quaint gothic,

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.460
archaic dictions and fancies.
 

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:59.323
The dead are raising their
objections here to guns that

00:20:59.323 --> 00:21:04.210
will be used very shortly in the
Great War.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.821
God reassures them,
though, of course,

00:21:07.821 --> 00:21:11.529
what he says here is not
reassuring.

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:15.968
He says that although "red war"
is getting redder,

00:21:15.968 --> 00:21:19.230
it's really as it always has
been.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:24.160
This is not the end of the
world that it appears to be.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:30.769
He's not about to let mankind
off the hook with Judgment Day.

00:21:30.769 --> 00:21:37.189
The speaker-narrator lies back
and wonders if the world will

00:21:37.189 --> 00:21:41.391
ever be saner.
His neighbor says,

00:21:41.391 --> 00:21:44.809
"Well, I don't think so.
 

00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:54.875
I wish I had pleasured myself
rather than serving that wicked

00:21:54.875 --> 00:21:59.450
God."
In the last stanza then there

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:04.609
is that extraordinary shift of
perspective.

00:22:04.609 --> 00:22:12.250
The sound of the guns carries
inland, into the heart of

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:19.890
England, and as it does it
carries back also in time to

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:25.550
Camelot and to "starlit
Stonehenge."

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.099
What happens when that happens?
 

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:35.372
What is the meaning of this –
the power of the sound of the

00:22:35.372 --> 00:22:38.299
guns to echo back in time?
 

00:22:38.299 --> 00:22:46.354
As Hardy evokes Camelot and
Stonehenge, you might read this,

00:22:46.354 --> 00:22:50.039
understand this as,
what?

00:22:50.039 --> 00:22:58.131
As dignifying and legitimating
the present firing,

00:22:58.131 --> 00:23:01.930
the present conflict?
 

00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:05.559
Or in some sense does it do
just the opposite?

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:14.376
Does it suggest that England's
history and its heritage and its

00:23:14.376 --> 00:23:17.789
honor are in jeopardy?
 

00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:24.953
Does it in some sense
demythologize the past,

00:23:24.953 --> 00:23:30.815
demystify it,
make us see Camelot and

00:23:30.815 --> 00:23:40.420
Stonehenge as part of a barbaric
history such as is about to

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:46.865
unfold in 1914?
There are a couple of other

00:23:46.865 --> 00:23:53.029
Hardy poems in your anthology,
memorable and powerful,

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:57.792
that are war poems,
including on page 59,

00:23:57.792 --> 00:24:03.150
"In The Time of 'the Breaking
of Nations,'"

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:10.789
and then on the next page,
"I Looked Up From My Writing."

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:14.259
Interesting to look at these
together.

00:24:14.259 --> 00:24:21.641
In this first poem Hardy
affirms the endurance of rural

00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:26.700
life and its cycles:
I

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:32.140
Only a man harrowing clods
In a slow silent walk

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.519
With an old horse that stumbles
and nods

00:24:35.519 --> 00:24:38.567
Half asleep as they stalk.
 

00:24:38.567 --> 00:24:43.760
II
Only thin smoke without flame

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:49.730
From the heaps of couch-grass;
Yet this will go onward the same

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.809
Though Dynasties pass.
 

00:24:51.809 --> 00:24:56.350
III
Yonder a maid and her wight

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:00.115
Come whispering by:
War's annals will fade into

00:25:00.115 --> 00:25:03.089
night
Ere their story die.

00:25:03.089 --> 00:25:09.653
Rural life, including rituals
of love and courtship,

00:25:09.653 --> 00:25:16.731
here are represented as
poetry's truest subject and as a

00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:23.809
kind of enduring source of
social life and meaning.

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:29.864
You could compare this poem to
the poem placed last in Yeats's

00:25:29.864 --> 00:25:35.819
last poems called "Politics"
that might seem to say something

00:25:35.819 --> 00:25:38.284
similar.
In Hardy here,

00:25:38.284 --> 00:25:41.836
and in other poems,
there's this sort of

00:25:41.836 --> 00:25:46.390
wonderfully, self-consciously
archaic language.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:51.913
Hardy wants to use really old
dialect words,

00:25:51.913 --> 00:25:57.180
when he can,
and there's power in that.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.009
And this is a poem composed in
1915.

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:03.185
When we read "The Love Song of
J.

00:26:03.185 --> 00:26:07.060
Alfred Prufrock," when we read
Pound's first Canto,

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:11.002
remember that those poems are
written and published at just

00:26:11.002 --> 00:26:14.130
the same time this poem's being
written;

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:22.184
poems with very different ways
of proceeding and different

00:26:22.184 --> 00:26:25.009
kinds of language.
 

00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:28.635
In the second poem here,
"I Looked Up From My Writing,"

00:26:28.635 --> 00:26:32.261
the poet, the first person,
is being interrupted at his

00:26:32.261 --> 00:26:37.829
desk at night.
He is startled to see:

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:40.460
…The moon's full gaze
on me.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:44.120
Her meditative misty head
Was spectral in its air,

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.880
And I involuntarily said,
'What are you doing there?'

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:52.586
[Hardy works in these song
forms that, well,

00:26:52.586 --> 00:26:58.168
they sound like popular
ballads, and he wants you to

00:26:58.168 --> 00:27:02.711
hear them as
part of almost a kind of folk

00:27:02.711 --> 00:27:05.599
literature, which he draws on.
 

00:27:05.599 --> 00:27:10.271
The moon says to him:]
'Oh, I've been scanning pond

00:27:10.271 --> 00:27:12.920
and hole
And waterway hereabout

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.370
For the body of one with a
sunken soul

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.970
Who has put his life-light out.
 

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:21.190
'Did you hear his frenzied
tattle?

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:26.920
It was sorrow for his son
Who is slain in brutish battle,

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.980
Though he has injured none.
 

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:35.500
'And now [the moon says]
I am curious to look

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.380
Into the blinkered mind [the
poet's]

00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:43.180
Of one who wants to write a book
In a world of such a kind.'

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:48.369
Her temper [the poet then says]
overwrought me,

00:27:48.369 --> 00:27:53.039
And I edged to shun her view
[to get out of the moonlight]

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.650
For I felt assured she thought
me

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.670
One who should drown him
too.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:04.333
Here, a neighbor father,
crazed with grief at the death

00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:09.759
of his son, has drowned himself,
killed himself,

00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:17.072
and the moon implies in its
gaze that the poet should do so,

00:28:17.072 --> 00:28:20.766
too.
In such a world it seems

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:26.891
writing poems is a kind
of--well, even surviving is a

00:28:26.891 --> 00:28:30.190
kind of guilty privilege.
 

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.720
You could compare with this
poem Kipling's poem;

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:38.760
Kipling, one of the great
apologists of empire,

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.029
saying on page 153 of your book
in the voice of a soldier,

00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:48.877
"If any question why we died,
/ tell them,

00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:56.089
because our fathers lied" – a
statement that is poignant,

00:28:56.089 --> 00:29:01.820
poignant and powerful in part
because Kipling's own son died

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.180
in the war .
 

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:10.119
 
 

00:29:10.119 --> 00:29:16.952
This is a volume of poems
published in 1917 by Edward

00:29:16.952 --> 00:29:23.947
Thomas and a portrait of Thomas,
another soldier poet,

00:29:23.947 --> 00:29:28.881
not represented however as a
soldier here:

00:29:28.881 --> 00:29:35.260
represented rather as an
English citizen in tweed,

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:40.650
a man out in and of nature.
 

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:48.559
Thomas was born in 1878,
so he was thirty-six when the

00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:53.041
war began.
He began, almost at the same

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:56.789
time as the war began,
to write poems.

00:29:56.789 --> 00:30:02.971
He begins writing under the
influence of his friend,

00:30:02.971 --> 00:30:07.475
Robert Frost.
Frost and Thomas have a

00:30:07.475 --> 00:30:13.429
fascinating relationship,
an important transatlantic

00:30:13.429 --> 00:30:16.926
exchange.
Frost's famous poem,

00:30:16.926 --> 00:30:22.375
"The Road Not Taken," he
sometimes described as being

00:30:22.375 --> 00:30:28.559
about Thomas and Thomas's own
sense of regret and hesitation

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:34.024
and indirection,
to which Frost contrasted

00:30:34.024 --> 00:30:38.988
himself.
Frost became in England a poet

00:30:38.988 --> 00:30:46.817
of New England whom Thomas was
reading at that moment in such a

00:30:46.817 --> 00:30:54.833
way as to help enable him,
Thomas, to become a great poet

00:30:54.833 --> 00:31:02.958
of England and of England's
landscape and countryside and

00:31:02.958 --> 00:31:08.522
nature.
There's a good selection from

00:31:08.522 --> 00:31:12.210
Thomas in your anthology.
 

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:20.429
I will read my favorite poem by
Thomas, which is the first one,

00:31:20.429 --> 00:31:25.070
called "Adlestrop," on page
231:

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:36.329
 
 

00:31:36.329 --> 00:31:40.560
Yes, I remember
Adlestrop--

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.800
The name, because one afternoon
Of heat the express-train drew

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.380
up there
Unwontedly.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.650
It was late June.
 

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:54.140
The steam hissed.
 

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:57.560
Someone cleared his throat.
 

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:04.440
No one left and no one came
On the bare platform.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:11.000
What I saw
Was Adlestrop--only the name

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.059
And willows,
willow-herb,

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:17.519
and grass,
And meadowsweet,

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:23.306
and haycocks dry,
No whit less still and lonely

00:32:23.306 --> 00:32:27.127
fair
Than the high cloudlets in the

00:32:27.127 --> 00:32:31.405
sky.
And for that minute a blackbird

00:32:31.405 --> 00:32:35.348
sang
Close by, and round him,

00:32:35.348 --> 00:32:38.994
mistier,
Farther and farther,

00:32:38.994 --> 00:32:41.969
all the birds
Of Oxfordshire and

00:32:41.969 --> 00:32:43.630
Gloucestershire.
 

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.769
 
 

00:32:46.769 --> 00:32:52.985
It's a wonderful poem in its
simplicity, modesty,

00:32:52.985 --> 00:33:01.014
directness, and reticence which
yet provides the most expansive

00:33:01.014 --> 00:33:08.396
and exhilarating sense of the
English landscape and of the

00:33:08.396 --> 00:33:15.648
power of a moment in time to
enlarge and be pregnant with

00:33:15.648 --> 00:33:22.456
meaning.
Notice Thomas's really superb

00:33:22.456 --> 00:33:29.970
nonchalance and offhandedness
and simplicity.

00:33:29.970 --> 00:33:31.970
"It was late June."
 

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.180
"The steam hissed."
 

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:40.221
There's a kind of colloquial
clarity and confidence,

00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:46.854
quite different from the
vernacular language in the Hardy

00:33:46.854 --> 00:33:52.983
poems I was just reading,
which are also poems of the

00:33:52.983 --> 00:33:55.812
countryside.
Here the name,

00:33:55.812 --> 00:34:00.408
the odd name "Adlestrop,"
prompts a memory,

00:34:00.408 --> 00:34:06.755
prompts a memory in such a way
that a moment in time stands

00:34:06.755 --> 00:34:10.500
out,
separated from other moments;

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:15.310
just as the odd,
unpoetic, unbeautiful name

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:19.090
"Adlestrop" seems to stand out.
 

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:22.264
There's a kind of poignant
tension between the

00:34:22.264 --> 00:34:25.579
unbeautifulness of the name,
the awkwardness,

00:34:25.579 --> 00:34:31.463
and yet the dignity of the
name, and the sense of natural

00:34:31.463 --> 00:34:35.139
beauty that the poem will
unfold.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:40.611
Here, the stopping of the train
is like the interruption by

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:46.460
memory of normal consciousness
that's the basis of the poem.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:52.609
There's a sense that in this
memory the poet somehow saw the

00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:56.732
name--presumably,
I suppose, saw it on a

00:34:56.732 --> 00:35:01.895
signboard in the station,
as you roll into the station

00:35:01.895 --> 00:35:04.719
and you see where you are.
 

00:35:04.719 --> 00:35:10.329
But there's more suggestion in
it than that.

00:35:10.329 --> 00:35:16.365
It's as if this moment were one
in which the name and the place,

00:35:16.365 --> 00:35:20.929
the word and the thing,
fully coincided,

00:35:20.929 --> 00:35:27.300
fully coincided in an
experience of presence and

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:34.350
immediacy where the world is all
there and named,

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:41.570
located, placed.
The figure, the metaphor for

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:47.440
this semiotic unity of word and
thing is bird-song.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.690
Here bird-song is a kind of
natural language,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:53.349
a language in which nature
speaks,

00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:59.819
and speaks in such a way that
the particular voice carries the

00:35:59.819 --> 00:36:03.849
import and authority of the
general,

00:36:03.849 --> 00:36:08.992
just as the one bird seems to
sing with many bird-songs by the

00:36:08.992 --> 00:36:12.837
end of the poem.
And so Adlestrop itself

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:18.605
suddenly seems to signify more,
calling to mind in kind of

00:36:18.605 --> 00:36:23.260
rippling and radiating circles
Oxfordshire,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:29.801
Gloucestershire,
England – all of it,

00:36:29.801 --> 00:36:34.713
the poet's home.
At the same time it's also

00:36:34.713 --> 00:36:38.410
clear that this epiphany is a
remembered experience.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:41.894
It's recalled.
The poet's first word,

00:36:41.894 --> 00:36:46.069
"yes" – a wonderful
affirmation – situates the

00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:50.329
poem in a dialogue as if someone
had just said,

00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:53.780
"Have you ever been to
Adlestrop?"

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:59.679
Whether this dialogue is actual
or internal, it doesn't really

00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:03.803
matter.
Part of the poem's force

00:37:03.803 --> 00:37:12.208
derives from the status of this
moment as something remembered,

00:37:12.208 --> 00:37:19.800
and remembered within the
context of a nation at war.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.918
Although I believe Thomas wrote
the poem the year he enlisted

00:37:24.918 --> 00:37:28.159
but, I think,
before his enlistment,

00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:34.739
you might feel as though Thomas
is already on the train for

00:37:34.739 --> 00:37:38.707
France.
There's a way in which the

00:37:38.707 --> 00:37:43.695
context of the war,
too, shadows the poem and

00:37:43.695 --> 00:37:46.530
remains present in it.
 

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:52.925
Don't you feel it in certain
details: the eerie lack of

00:37:52.925 --> 00:37:55.650
people in this place?
 

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.090
"No one left and no one came."
 

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:03.678
In a sense it is an image of
the English countryside at a

00:38:03.678 --> 00:38:07.119
moment in which it is being
emptied out,

00:38:07.119 --> 00:38:13.763
its young men sent to France to
die, a kind of no man's land

00:38:13.763 --> 00:38:14.890
already.
 

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:20.760
 
 

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:27.050
This is Siegfried Sassoon in
uniform in 1916.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:35.395
Sassoon's poetry centers on
hallucinatory overlays of

00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:40.210
home-front and battle-front.
 

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:55.558
Let's look at "'Blighters'" on
page 389, a wonderfully angry

00:38:55.558 --> 00:39:00.709
poem;
a poem that is situated in a

00:39:00.709 --> 00:39:06.060
music hall, presumably a London
music hall:

00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:09.060
 
 

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:15.420
The House is crammed;
tier beyond tier they grin

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:19.760
And cackle at the Show,
while prancing ranks

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.610
Of harlots shrill the chorus,
drunk with din;

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:27.170
'We're sure the Kaiser loves
the dear old Tanks!'

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:31.889
I'd like to see a Tank come
down the stalls,

00:39:31.889 --> 00:39:35.860
Lurching to rag-time tunes,
or 'Home, sweet Home',

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.480
And there'd be no more jokes in
Music-halls

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.220
To mock the riddled corpses
round Bapaume.

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:46.110
 
 

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:51.692
Here, there's an analogy
between the music hall and the

00:39:51.692 --> 00:39:57.237
theater of war.
It's as if the English populace

00:39:57.237 --> 00:40:03.469
were spectators only,
consuming as entertainment war

00:40:03.469 --> 00:40:09.090
propaganda, which makes the poet
hate them.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:13.299
He imagines here the eruption
of the real into this

00:40:13.299 --> 00:40:17.592
representational space,
and imagines it as a kind of

00:40:17.592 --> 00:40:22.643
attack on the working and middle
class audiences of the music

00:40:22.643 --> 00:40:25.583
hall.
The soldier becomes,

00:40:25.583 --> 00:40:28.603
in fantasy here,
the spectator,

00:40:28.603 --> 00:40:34.342
as the war turns around and
comes back, reversed by a kind

00:40:34.342 --> 00:40:38.469
of evil charm or spell,
coming home.

00:40:38.469 --> 00:40:45.846
And "home" is here made to
rhyme with "Bapaume," bringing

00:40:45.846 --> 00:40:52.300
battlefront and home front
together as a rhyme.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:56.752
There's an aggression towards
the urban crowd here that

00:40:56.752 --> 00:41:01.699
recalls and exaggerates Yeats's
attitude at the same time,

00:41:01.699 --> 00:41:07.685
really in the same years,
in poems like "A Coat" or "The

00:41:07.685 --> 00:41:11.702
Fisherman."
In other Sassoon poems,

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:15.550
the war comes home in other
ways.

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:22.798
For example,
in "The Rear-Guard," just down

00:41:22.798 --> 00:41:29.078
the page here;
or "Repression of War

00:41:29.078 --> 00:41:39.130
Experience," which is about
traumatic repetition of battle;

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:46.320
or in "Dreamers," where there
is, again, a kind of juxtaposing

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:51.860
of life in the trenches and life
in the city.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.699
 
 

00:41:55.699 --> 00:42:01.088
Rather than dwell longer on
them though, and to make sure I

00:42:01.088 --> 00:42:04.340
get time for a couple more
poems,

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:10.309
I want to move on and
consider--Here is a collection

00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:15.460
of Sassoon's poems,
Counter-Attack,

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:20.489
and this is The Poetry of
Isaac Rosenberg.

00:42:20.489 --> 00:42:29.969
Here's a frontispiece with
Rosenberg in a military coat.

00:42:29.969 --> 00:42:36.498
Rosenberg, besides a poet,
was also an artist and created

00:42:36.498 --> 00:42:39.180
these self-portraits.
 

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.520
 
 

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:47.599
"Self-Portrait in France, 1915."
 

00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:53.952
Rosenberg, in contrast to
Sassoon, was poor,

00:42:53.952 --> 00:43:01.930
Jewish, and writes a rather
different kind of poem from

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:07.840
those we have been looking at
today.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.263
One of the most famous and
extraordinary is "Louse

00:43:13.263 --> 00:43:19.085
Hunting," on page 506;
a little bit further on in your

00:43:19.085 --> 00:43:19.800
book:
 

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.130
 
 

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:28.140
Nudes--stark and
glistening,

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.860
Yelling in lurid glee.
 

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.310
Grinning faces
And raging limbs

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:35.490
Whirl over the floor one fire.
 

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:40.388
For a shirt verminously busy
Yon soldier tore from his

00:43:40.388 --> 00:43:44.578
throat, with oaths
Godhead might shrink at,

00:43:44.578 --> 00:43:46.610
but not the lice.
 

00:43:46.610 --> 00:43:51.366
And soon the shirt was aflare
Over the candle he'd lit while

00:43:51.366 --> 00:43:55.550
we lay.
Then we all sprang up and stript

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.960
To hunt the verminous brood.
 

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:04.190
[Here the soldiers are
stripping their

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:10.020
clothes off and attacking the
lice that are attacking them.]

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:16.210
Soon like a demons' pantomime
The place was raging.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:21.211
[It's nighttime and the candles
and flares are throwing

00:44:21.211 --> 00:44:24.170
shadows.]
See the silhouettes agape,

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:28.002
See the gibbering shadows
Mixed with the battled arms on

00:44:28.002 --> 00:44:31.200
the wall.
See gargantuan hooked fingers

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:37.460
Pluck in supreme flesh
To smutch supreme littleness.

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:41.130
See the merry limbs in hot
Highland fling

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.502
Because some wizard vermin
Charmed from the quiet this

00:44:44.502 --> 00:44:48.340
revel
When our ears were half lulled

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:53.379
By the dark music
Blown from Sleep's

00:44:53.379 --> 00:44:58.531
trumpet.
A strange place for this poem

00:44:58.531 --> 00:45:02.750
to end.
"Nudes," the poem begins.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:10.473
It's shocking and comic and
pleasurable to see the armored

00:45:10.473 --> 00:45:18.061
men, uniformed men suddenly
exposed – just naked bodies

00:45:18.061 --> 00:45:26.191
– to see them here bedeviled
not by a gas attack or machine

00:45:26.191 --> 00:45:29.849
guns but lice,
fleas.

00:45:29.849 --> 00:45:37.168
Rosenberg is writing not in
those little crafted stanzas of

00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:42.090
Hardy or, for that matter,
of Thomas.

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:47.073
He's writing in a kind of
strongly stressed free verse

00:45:47.073 --> 00:45:53.537
with variable line lengths,
lots of--well there's a sense

00:45:53.537 --> 00:46:01.270
in which the poetry itself is
exuberant and naked and full of

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:05.883
life and vital;
and naturalistic,

00:46:05.883 --> 00:46:11.010
you could say,
in its representation.

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:16.592
Rosenberg is giving us an
anecdote from the trenches,

00:46:16.592 --> 00:46:22.389
and yet it slips very quickly
into a sense of fable.

00:46:22.389 --> 00:46:27.249
The louse hunting,
where these big men hunt these

00:46:27.249 --> 00:46:29.881
little things,
these fleas:

00:46:29.881 --> 00:46:35.247
it becomes – when it's thrown
by shadow as a kind of

00:46:35.247 --> 00:46:40.309
flickering image on the tent or
trench wall,

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:44.827
when it becomes represented,
so to speak – it becomes a

00:46:44.827 --> 00:46:48.779
battle scene where gigantic
forces "smutch supreme

00:46:48.779 --> 00:46:52.506
littleness."
We are put in mind of how men

00:46:52.506 --> 00:46:55.280
are to the Gods as flies to men.
 

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.488
This is an analogy as old as,
and found in,

00:46:59.488 --> 00:47:02.861
Homer.
We are also put in mind of how

00:47:02.861 --> 00:47:06.375
the war is, in fact,
anything but a revel,

00:47:06.375 --> 00:47:09.792
though it,
too, may have been provoked by

00:47:09.792 --> 00:47:14.165
a cause as insignificant and
hard to trace as "some wizard

00:47:14.165 --> 00:47:17.099
vermin."
Those last lines,

00:47:17.099 --> 00:47:21.280
then, are so ominous and
strange.

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:26.567
Though these men have been
brought to life from sleep,

00:47:26.567 --> 00:47:31.656
there's a sense that the
trumpet will sound for them

00:47:31.656 --> 00:47:37.542
again and they will enter a dark
sleep from which they won't

00:47:37.542 --> 00:47:41.829
wake,
which is just the point of the

00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:46.400
next poem, "Returning,
We Hear the Larks."

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.811
I won't take time to read it,
though, or talk about it,

00:47:51.811 --> 00:47:57.222
but instead I'd like to
conclude--This is another great

00:47:57.222 --> 00:48:03.415
poet of the war who survived,
though in, as I say,

00:48:03.415 --> 00:48:09.619
a wounded condition mentally,
Ivor Gurney.

00:48:09.619 --> 00:48:15.810
I want to conclude with a poem
by Owen.

00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.780
 
 

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:28.861
Let's see, this is page 528,
just following "Dulce et

00:48:28.861 --> 00:48:34.800
Decorum Est," "Strange Meeting."
 

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:43.181
This is a poem that--well,
if the first poem demystifies

00:48:43.181 --> 00:48:48.820
one crucial thread of war
ideology,

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:54.120
that it is right and good to
die for the country,

00:48:54.120 --> 00:49:00.415
this poem takes on another
crucial element of war ideology

00:49:00.415 --> 00:49:06.710
that the enemy is an "other":
the enemy is unlike me.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:12.267
Like Rosenberg,
like Rosenberg's poem,

00:49:12.267 --> 00:49:20.679
this one comes out of and
returns eventually to sleep.

00:49:20.679 --> 00:49:30.649
It is a kind of dream vision,
Dantesque in its mode,

00:49:30.649 --> 00:49:38.860
and full of powerful iambic
pentameter:

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:41.469
It seemed that out of
battle I escaped

00:49:41.469 --> 00:49:46.400
Down some profound dull tunnel,
long since scooped

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:53.230
Through granites which titanic
wars had groined.

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:57.500
Yet also there encumbered
sleepers groaned,

00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:02.670
Too fast in thought or death to
be bestirred.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:08.514
Then, as I probed them,
one sprang up,

00:50:08.514 --> 00:50:12.833
and stared
With piteous recognition in

00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:17.970
fixed eyes,
Lifting distressful hands,

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:21.652
as if to bless.
And by his smile,

00:50:21.652 --> 00:50:26.750
I knew that sullen hall,--
By his dead smile I knew we

00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:30.458
stood in Hell.
With a thousand pains that

00:50:30.458 --> 00:50:34.594
vision's face was grained;
Yet no blood reached there from

00:50:34.594 --> 00:50:37.244
the upper ground,
And no guns thumped,

00:50:37.244 --> 00:50:39.280
or down the flues made moan.
 

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:44.780
'Strange friend,' I said,
'here is no cause to mourn.'

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:50.090
'None,' said the other,
'save the undone years,

00:50:50.090 --> 00:50:52.360
The hopelessness.
 

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:57.110
Whatever hope is yours,
Was my life also;

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:01.476
I went hunting wild
After the wildest beauty in the

00:51:01.476 --> 00:51:04.393
world,
Which lies not calm in eyes,

00:51:04.393 --> 00:51:08.271
or braided hair,
But mocks the steady running of

00:51:08.271 --> 00:51:10.793
the hour,
And if it grieves,

00:51:10.793 --> 00:51:13.519
grieves richlier than here.
 

00:51:13.519 --> 00:51:17.389
For by my glee might many men
have laughed,

00:51:17.389 --> 00:51:20.160
And of my weeping something had
been left,

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.700
Which must die now.
 

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.514
I mean the truth untold,
The pity of war,

00:51:26.514 --> 00:51:28.860
the pity war distilled.
 

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:32.570
Now men will go content with
what we spoiled,

00:51:32.570 --> 00:51:35.484
Or, discontent,
boil bloody,

00:51:35.484 --> 00:51:38.962
and be spilled.
They will be swift with

00:51:38.962 --> 00:51:40.820
swiftness of the tigress.
 

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:44.500
None will break ranks,
tough nations trek from

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:47.236
progress.
Courage was mine,

00:51:47.236 --> 00:51:50.670
and I had mystery,
Wisdom was mine,

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:54.113
and I had mastery:
To miss the march of this

00:51:54.113 --> 00:51:57.788
retreating world
Into vain citadels that are not

00:51:57.788 --> 00:52:00.706
walled.
Then, when much blood had

00:52:00.706 --> 00:52:05.472
clogged their chariot-wheels,
I would go up and wash them

00:52:05.472 --> 00:52:09.803
from sweet wells,
Even with truths that lie too

00:52:09.803 --> 00:52:14.039
deep for taint.
I would have poured my spirit

00:52:14.039 --> 00:52:17.180
without stint
But not through wounds;

00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.159
not on the cess of war.
 

00:52:20.159 --> 00:52:24.070
Foreheads of men have bled
where no wounds were.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:29.360
'I am the enemy you killed,
my friend.

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:33.789
I knew you in this dark:
for so you frowned

00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:39.390
Yesterday through me as you
jabbed and killed.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:44.564
I parried;
but my hands were loath and

00:52:44.564 --> 00:52:49.219
cold.
Let us sleep now….'

00:52:49.219 --> 00:52:57.626
So, we'll stop now and move on
to poems written during the same

00:52:57.626 --> 00:53:04.000
period and associated with
Imagism on Monday.

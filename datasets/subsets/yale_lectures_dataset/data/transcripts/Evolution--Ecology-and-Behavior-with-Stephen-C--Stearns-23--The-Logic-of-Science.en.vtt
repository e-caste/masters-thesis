00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.806
Prof: Okay,
so today what we're going to

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:08.940
talk about is the logic of
science.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.408
And there's a reason that this
lecture comes at this point in

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:13.160
the course.
 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.057
Most of you are now just
getting to the point where

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:17.220
you're going to get serious
about writing your papers--

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.060
that's going to happen during
the next couple of weeks--

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.120
and in doing that,
you're going to be making

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.462
judgments about how good is the
science that you're reading in

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:28.530
the papers.
 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.170
So I want to raise,
in your minds,

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.330
this issue of what constitutes
science and what is not science,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.730
and what's good science and
what's bad science,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.280
so that you'll yourself start
to develop your own criteria.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.194
And these are issues that have
occupied a lot of bright people

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:52.642
for a number of centuries;
so I'll only be touching on a

00:00:52.642 --> 00:00:56.650
few points this morning,
but they're important ones.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.677
Now science is basically
culture's answer to the big

00:01:00.677 --> 00:01:04.469
problem of epistemology,
which is how can we know

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.049
anything at all?
 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.060
How do we know that there is a
material reality?

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.403
And this issue,
as you know,

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:16.530
goes back to Plato and
Aristotle,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.939
in the Western tradition,
and in each of the other major

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.188
cultural traditions these issues
have been debated.

00:01:25.188 --> 00:01:31.343
There's a lovely humorous story
in Zuang Zi from the third

00:01:31.343 --> 00:01:32.640
century B.C.
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.879
in China, about this issue.
 

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:40.703
So basically if you look at
what all the different parts of

00:01:40.703 --> 00:01:45.860
our culture do for our society,
this is the role of science.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.565
It tries to give some kind of
objective message about the

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:52.610
nature of reality,
to everybody in the culture,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.860
if they want to pay attention.
 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.644
Now in talking about this,
I am essentially assuming that

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:03.489
you've got some background in
these issues;

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:07.378
and not all of you do,
but there are places where you

00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:08.500
can catch up.
 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.604
For example,
Bertrand Russell wrote a

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:13.996
somewhat opinionated but amusing
and informative history of

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:17.108
Western philosophy,
where you can sit down and in

00:02:17.108 --> 00:02:20.818
the course of about a month read
through all of the major issues

00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:22.348
that have been debated.
 

00:02:22.348 --> 00:02:25.238
I'm going to assume that you
know that David Hume

00:02:25.238 --> 00:02:28.427
demonstrated that inference
doesn't lead infallibly to

00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:29.030
truth.
 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.890
And that's an interesting point
and it's one that I think a lot

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.889
of modern philosophers probably
would disagree with,

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:39.378
to some extent.
 

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:42.745
Basically what Hume was arguing
about was how do we know that in

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.628
fact the sun will rise in the
east tomorrow morning?

00:02:45.628 --> 00:02:48.098
And the fact that it's just
done so, for a long time,

00:02:48.098 --> 00:02:50.139
is no guarantee that it will do
it again.

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.800
We need to know something else
in order to feel confident that

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.740
the sun will rise in the east
tomorrow morning.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.395
And, in fact,
what we've got going for us now

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:02.653
is we've got a model of the
universe in which the earth

00:03:02.653 --> 00:03:06.336
spins on its axis and planets go
around the sun and stuff like

00:03:06.336 --> 00:03:07.000
that.
 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.658
That is a theory.
 

00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:12.533
It's a model of the universe,
and it's been so extensively

00:03:12.533 --> 00:03:16.611
validated and connected to so
many observations that it would

00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:18.720
be mad to deny its reality.
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.669
But that's quite different from
just sitting there,

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.170
without having that model of
the universe in your head and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.189
noting that the sun comes up
every morning,

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.080
and just accumulating instances.
 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.419
And what Hume essentially
pointed out was that just the

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.191
accumulation of instances is not
leading you infallibly to the

00:03:35.191 --> 00:03:37.663
truth;
that there could be alternative

00:03:37.663 --> 00:03:38.500
explanations.
 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.196
So without that contest of
alternative explanations having

00:03:42.196 --> 00:03:45.956
taken place, we don't really
know that the sun will come up

00:03:45.956 --> 00:03:47.190
in the morning.
 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.414
By the way, it is rather
similar with the issue of

00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:53.180
something like is DNA the
genetic code,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.810
which is a little bit closer to
the subject of this course.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.129
It was not at all clear,
say in 1945,

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.557
in the Avery experiment,
that DNA was the genetic

00:04:04.557 --> 00:04:05.848
substance.
 

00:04:05.848 --> 00:04:10.968
And as late as the discovery of
the structure of DNA in 1953,

00:04:10.968 --> 00:04:13.837
by Watson and Crick,
there were still people who

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:16.829
felt that DNA probably wasn't
the genetic code;

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.920
that it was probably some
protein that contained the

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.829
genetic code.
 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.709
And so there was a contest of
alternatives,

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:26.259
there were critical experiments
that were done,

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.672
and then the evidence
accumulated to the point where

00:04:30.672 --> 00:04:36.209
it would become mad to deny that
DNA is the genetic molecule,

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:39.910
and that it has a particular
triplet code and so forth.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.379
So that's a way of showing how
a working hypothesis survives a

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:50.490
contest of alternatives to
become something that then gets

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.720
operationally accepted as truth.
 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.180
&gt;
 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.834
And I suppose that it is
conceivable that someone might

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:03.100
now come up with an observation
that would convince us that,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.310
at least in some cases,
DNA wasn't the genetic code.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.223
But for all intents and
purposes, this contest of

00:05:09.223 --> 00:05:11.851
alternative ideas,
through experimental

00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:15.367
demonstrations,
leads to something that science

00:05:15.367 --> 00:05:18.040
then accepts pretty much as
truth.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:24.345
And what I'm telling you is
that these theories about the

00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:29.862
structure of reality are
basically arrived at by a

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:36.392
contest of ideas that is being
testing empirically over and

00:05:36.392 --> 00:05:41.483
over again,
and you're accepting the last

00:05:41.483 --> 00:05:44.230
one that's left standing.
 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.680
So here's more or less what
scientists think.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.122
They think there's a material
reality and they think we can

00:05:52.122 --> 00:05:53.050
discover its nature.
 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.829
Not everybody on the planet
agrees with that.

00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:01.410
We can eventually agree on what
we've discovered.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.490
At the leading edge of science
there's plenty of disagreement

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.127
about the nature of reality;
that's the whole point about

00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:11.050
the contest of alternative
hypotheses.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.411
So what we call science is
limited to knowledge about the

00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:19.930
part of material nature that is
currently accessible by our

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.072
current technology,
our current techniques,

00:06:25.072 --> 00:06:31.269
our current investment,
and on which we can agree;

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:33.819
and that agreement can take
some time.

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:38.389
And not everything in material
nature is accessible.

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:44.440
If you just go back and you
look, for example,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.704
prior to the discovery of- or
to the invention of sensors that

00:06:49.704 --> 00:06:55.055
could detect the orientation of
magnetic fields on the floor of

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:58.079
the ocean,
we didn't have access to the

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:00.800
evidence that demonstrated plate
tectonics.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.110
Okay?
 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.540
So that's something that
happened after about the Second

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:08.406
World War, and that evidence was
accumulated actually mostly in

00:07:08.406 --> 00:07:09.838
the '50s and '60s.
 

00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:13.891
Prior to high throughput DNA
sequencing techniques,

00:07:13.891 --> 00:07:18.589
we did not have access to the
deep structure of the Tree of

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:19.319
Life.
 

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:22.439
So those are technological
advances that then open up

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:24.600
things that we can get answers
to.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.206
Currently we do not have the
technology to decide about

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:34.156
whether or not string theory is
the best way to look at the

00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:36.557
very,
very fine structure of

00:07:36.557 --> 00:07:40.355
substances, and therefore
whether or not time travel is

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:42.675
possible,
or there are worm holes in

00:07:42.675 --> 00:07:44.290
space time,
and stuff like that;

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.391
we don't have enough technology
to get us to where those ideas

00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:49.199
are going.
 

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:54.644
So this is something that
depends on the current state of

00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:55.910
technology.
 

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:02.031
Now the part of knowledge that
people can agree upon,

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:06.153
through this debate of
alternatives,

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:11.617
is what we call science;
and that means that somebody

00:08:11.617 --> 00:08:14.019
else can replicate your claim.
 

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:17.992
They can't replicate your claim
unless you've described it

00:08:17.992 --> 00:08:18.689
clearly.
 

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:21.997
That means if you're reading a
paper, for one of your papers,

00:08:21.997 --> 00:08:24.920
and somebody can't tell you
clearly what they've done,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.740
they're not doing a good job.
 

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.478
They have to be able to write
clearly in order to complete

00:08:30.478 --> 00:08:32.120
this part of the logic.
 

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.639
One of the loveliest cases of
this that I ran into was now

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:39.769
almost 30 years ago.
 

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:44.264
I was invited to Scandinavia,
and there were people there in

00:08:44.264 --> 00:08:50.481
departments in Göteborg --
Gothenburg -- and in Lund and

00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:55.013
in Oslo and in Stockholm,
and Uppsala,

00:08:55.013 --> 00:09:00.251
who did not have any professors
who could teach them modern

00:09:00.251 --> 00:09:02.240
behavioral ecology.
 

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.769
But they were fascinated by it,
and the professors that they

00:09:04.769 --> 00:09:07.211
had,
who were experts in things like

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:10.409
comparative morphology,
were willing to let their

00:09:10.409 --> 00:09:14.533
students study this new subject,
and the students taught it to

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:18.340
themselves entirely from the
scientific literature.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:21.226
It had been so effectively
described in journals that they

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:24.114
could pick up and read that
they'd bootstrapped themselves

00:09:24.114 --> 00:09:26.899
into becoming world experts in
behavioral ecology,

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:30.009
and the Scandinavian School of
Behavioral Ecology has become a

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:31.538
dominant force in the field.
 

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:34.662
They did it without having any
professors to teach them,

00:09:34.662 --> 00:09:36.990
because people could write good
papers.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:42.288
So that is one of the reasons
that I'm so enthusiastic about

00:09:42.288 --> 00:09:45.879
people learning to write
effectively,

00:09:45.879 --> 00:09:48.442
because it can actually
accomplish cultural

00:09:48.442 --> 00:09:49.480
transformation.
 

00:09:54.009 --> 00:09:56.929
I think I've already made this
point well enough.

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:57.700
Okay.
 

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.500
So how do we agree?
 

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.370
Well here are some issues.
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.782
I'm going to be talking a bit
about the method of multiple

00:10:07.782 --> 00:10:10.451
working hypotheses,
about falsifiability,

00:10:10.451 --> 00:10:13.907
about strong inference,
about scientific revolutions,

00:10:13.907 --> 00:10:17.601
and about the issue of whether
philosophers understand this

00:10:17.601 --> 00:10:19.450
better than scientists do.
 

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.320
And I'd like to touch a little
bit on where ideas come from;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.846
and I've already given you a
couple of hints on that in terms

00:10:26.846 --> 00:10:29.639
of support for writing your
papers.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:31.908
By the way, if I just go
through this,

00:10:31.908 --> 00:10:36.159
this is certainly not a
rigorous and inclusive coverage

00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:41.038
of all of the important points
in the philosophy of science.

00:10:41.038 --> 00:10:43.616
It is just hitting a few high
points that I hope will

00:10:43.616 --> 00:10:45.649
stimulate you to think about
these things,

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:47.830
and perhaps you'll want to read
further.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:52.740
So there are many different
ways of doing this,

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.000
but in choosing these
particular things I am hitting

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.427
on issues that have particularly
occupied the minds of

00:11:01.427 --> 00:11:02.678
biologists.
 

00:11:02.678 --> 00:11:05.798
So it's not random,
in that sense.

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:08.418
Okay, so let's go back to
T.C. Chamberlain.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:11.416
T.C. Chamberlain was the head
of the Geological Society of

00:11:11.416 --> 00:11:13.782
America,
and he gave a wonderful

00:11:13.782 --> 00:11:17.440
address, which has been
reprinted several times,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:21.350
and which is part of your
reading for Section this week.

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.365
And basically what Chamberlain
says is that we fall in love

00:11:24.365 --> 00:11:27.427
with our own ideas,
and therefore we're biased,

00:11:27.427 --> 00:11:30.480
and so when we look at a
pattern of data,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.107
we will have a tendency to pick
out the parts of it that support

00:11:34.107 --> 00:11:37.736
our preconceptions and to leave
out the parts that don't support

00:11:37.736 --> 00:11:40.537
our preconceptions,
and if you're interested in an

00:11:40.537 --> 00:11:43.350
objective view of reality,
this is a bad thing to do.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.500
So how do we protect ourselves
from this?

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.250
Well the best way,
he thought, was to explicitly

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.480
come up with a set of multiple
working hypotheses,

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.990
that are actually different
from each other,

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.720
and then weigh the evidence for
and against each of them.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.153
So this is a way of protecting
ourselves against our love for

00:12:03.153 --> 00:12:04.070
our own ideas.
 

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.570
Now sometimes,
several can all be correct,

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:13.802
and that is the case whenever
hypotheses are not mutually

00:12:13.802 --> 00:12:16.754
exclusive,
where they could all actually

00:12:16.754 --> 00:12:18.259
be working at the same time.
 

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:21.440
Sometimes that is true and
sometimes that's not true.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.272
That tends not to be true when
you're talking about particular

00:12:24.272 --> 00:12:25.340
molecular structures.
 

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.720
There is normally just one
molecular structure.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.133
If your techniques are not
good, there are some

00:12:32.133 --> 00:12:34.283
alternatives,
but when you get them really

00:12:34.283 --> 00:12:36.120
good, usually there's just one.
 

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.205
But often there are several
different selection pressures

00:12:40.205 --> 00:12:43.048
that will result in the same
outcome.

00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:45.039
And you've seen that with
sexual selection.

00:12:45.039 --> 00:12:46.000
Okay?
 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.330
So a female could be choosing a
male for good genes,

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.058
or because he's got lots of
resources,

00:12:51.058 --> 00:12:55.158
or because he'll have sexy
sons, and in fact those could

00:12:55.158 --> 00:12:57.470
all be true at the same time.
 

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:01.798
Now one way to get to
objectivity--

00:13:01.798 --> 00:13:03.929
given that, in fact,
the observer,

00:13:03.929 --> 00:13:07.076
the human,
always has kind of a selfish

00:13:07.076 --> 00:13:11.480
bias towards their own idea--
one way to achieve objectivity

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:15.086
is to try to demonstrate
systematically that a hypothesis

00:13:15.086 --> 00:13:15.860
is wrong.
 

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.683
And if you try to refute it,
rather than to confirm it,

00:13:19.683 --> 00:13:22.801
and you can't refute it,
it just is stubborn,

00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:26.129
it will not go away,
then maybe it's right.

00:13:26.129 --> 00:13:27.100
&gt;
 

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.009
Okay?
 

00:13:29.009 --> 00:13:33.187
So this is the idea behind
Popper's falsifiability

00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:34.210
criterion.
 

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.889
Karl Popper,
a very influential philosopher

00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:39.570
of science, member of the Vienna
School;

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:42.971
that was the school of people
that also had Wittgenstein and

00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:45.220
Carnap and a number of others in
it,

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:50.625
and these were people who were
engaged in very strong debate

00:13:50.625 --> 00:13:55.846
about how to make sense of the
discovery of reality in the

00:13:55.846 --> 00:13:58.870
post-quantum mechanics world.
 

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:03.131
And there had been a great deal
of uncertainty in the basis of

00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:04.991
our knowledge,
that entered in,

00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:08.187
in the early twentieth century,
with the discovery of quantum

00:14:08.187 --> 00:14:10.870
mechanics and of the theory of
relativity.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.620
To put you back into that,
for two or three-hundred years,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.110
people had thought that Newton
had actually figured it all out,

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.528
and then from about 1880 up to
about 1910 the Michelson-Morley

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:26.947
experiment and things like that
had demonstrated that speed of

00:14:26.947 --> 00:14:29.990
light was a constant in the
universe,

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.111
and the only way that that
could really be understood was

00:14:33.111 --> 00:14:35.899
through Einstein's special
Theory of Relativity.

00:14:35.899 --> 00:14:40.580
And that and the subsequent
discovery of quantum mechanics,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.525
which came out of the
photoelectric effect and other

00:14:44.525 --> 00:14:46.945
things,
made people realize that it was

00:14:46.945 --> 00:14:49.917
possible for science to go
cruising along for a couple of

00:14:49.917 --> 00:14:52.355
centuries,
thinking that it was right,

00:14:52.355 --> 00:14:54.870
and then to discover that it
was wrong.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.634
And that suggested,
well that could happen again,

00:14:57.634 --> 00:15:00.918
and it could happen in places
where we don't expect it.

00:15:00.918 --> 00:15:03.278
So what are we going to make of
all this?

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:09.432
Well one of the responses is
Popper's falsifiability

00:15:09.432 --> 00:15:10.879
criterion.
 

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:15.104
So what Popper says is that we
can never actually prove that an

00:15:15.104 --> 00:15:18.375
empirical statement is true,
for there are always

00:15:18.375 --> 00:15:20.759
alternatives that are possible.
 

00:15:20.759 --> 00:15:23.895
So these alternatives we might
not know about,

00:15:23.895 --> 00:15:27.101
but that would be a failure of
our imagination,

00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:29.820
it would not be a failure of
logic.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.840
However, we can demonstrate
that things are false.

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.360
So Popper claims this is what
distinguishes science from math.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.029
Okay?
 

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:42.414
You can prove a theorem in math;
you cannot prove an observation

00:15:42.414 --> 00:15:43.710
in science.
 

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:48.230
So proof means true at all
times, in all places.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.977
I think that you're currently
scratching your heads and

00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:53.701
wondering,
well in what sense is it not

00:15:53.701 --> 00:15:57.750
true that gravity is present
throughout the universe,

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:01.201
or that DNA is the genetic
code, or any of these other big

00:16:01.201 --> 00:16:03.200
things that we know in science.
 

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.806
Well I would say that the thing
that distinguishes science from

00:16:08.806 --> 00:16:11.313
math,
in statements like that,

00:16:11.313 --> 00:16:15.503
is that math is 100% certain,
and science is trying to get to

00:16:15.503 --> 00:16:17.570
the limit of that 100%
certainty;

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.102
so some of it's up there at
99.99, I would say,

00:16:21.102 --> 00:16:22.408
or even closer.
 

00:16:22.408 --> 00:16:25.677
But with math it's simply
logically true,

00:16:25.677 --> 00:16:30.580
and with science it's a matter
of empirical demonstration.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.100
So because of that,
Popper suggested that the

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:36.710
difference between science and
non-science is falsifiability.

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:39.940
If in principle you can
demonstrate that something is

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.738
false,
if a certain observation that

00:16:41.738 --> 00:16:43.490
one could imagine could
demonstrate it,

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.785
then you're dealing with
science, and if you cannot

00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:47.807
imagine ever making an
observation that would

00:16:47.807 --> 00:16:49.690
demonstrate that something is
false,

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:51.470
then you're dealing with
non-science.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:52.529
Okay?
 

00:16:52.529 --> 00:16:56.039
So that's how Popper
distinguished science from

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:56.879
religion.
 

00:16:56.879 --> 00:17:02.870
Now I think that there's
something to this.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.420
Basically what I take away from
this personally--

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:11.318
excuse me, I want this last
statement down here--

00:17:11.318 --> 00:17:14.886
is that we trust ideas that
have taken the strongest hits we

00:17:14.886 --> 00:17:17.730
can throw at them and they're
still standing.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.328
Okay?
 

00:17:19.328 --> 00:17:23.278
So that's, to me,
the best criterion for trying

00:17:23.278 --> 00:17:27.568
to see whether people are doing
natural science.

00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:29.876
They're not trying to confirm
the ideas, they're trying to be

00:17:29.876 --> 00:17:32.732
critical;
they're throwing everything

00:17:32.732 --> 00:17:36.877
they can at them,
and by George you can't knock

00:17:36.877 --> 00:17:38.048
them down.
 

00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:42.229
Now one person who more or less
implemented this was a chemist

00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:46.545
named Platt, and you're going to
read his paper for Section this

00:17:46.545 --> 00:17:47.710
week as well.
 

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:55.202
So Platt was one of the
physicists who had come into

00:17:55.202 --> 00:17:58.471
biology,
a physical chemist who had come

00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:00.315
into biology,
and he asked himself,

00:18:00.315 --> 00:18:03.153
"Why is it that some
fields make progress faster than

00:18:03.153 --> 00:18:03.950
others?"
 

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.188
And he said,
"Oh, it's-- actually we

00:18:06.188 --> 00:18:06.579
know.
 

00:18:06.579 --> 00:18:08.470
They have a good method.
 

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.980
It's called strong
inference."

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:15.509
So devise alternative
hypotheses--that's Chamberlain.

00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:20.269
Devise crucial experiments to
exclude hypotheses--that's

00:18:20.269 --> 00:18:21.048
Popper.
 

00:18:21.048 --> 00:18:25.349
Do the experiments so well that
nobody can argue with you,

00:18:25.349 --> 00:18:27.838
and then recycle the procedure.
 

00:18:27.838 --> 00:18:30.550
So he said people who are
making progress do that,

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.538
and people who aren't making
progress don't do that.

00:18:33.538 --> 00:18:41.083
And so in comments on this,
that had been quoted in the

00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:43.237
letters,
Leo Szilard,

00:18:43.237 --> 00:18:45.858
who is one of the founders of
molecular genetics,

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:49.518
molecular biology,
said the problems of how you

00:18:49.518 --> 00:18:52.846
induce enzymes,
or how you synthesize proteins,

00:18:52.846 --> 00:18:56.189
or how you form antibodies,
are actually something you can

00:18:56.189 --> 00:18:59.997
do with experiments,
that you can finish fairly

00:18:59.997 --> 00:19:02.287
quickly,
and it will only take a few

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:03.318
experiments to do it.
 

00:19:03.318 --> 00:19:06.673
So actually if intelligent
people were just dealing with

00:19:06.673 --> 00:19:09.598
this issue, we would get there
pretty quickly.

00:19:09.598 --> 00:19:12.308
And a young ambitious scientist
says,

00:19:12.308 --> 00:19:15.144
"It's essentially the old
question: how small and elegant

00:19:15.144 --> 00:19:16.910
an experiment can you
perform?"

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:20.028
And a descriptive scientist,
an electromicroscopist,

00:19:20.028 --> 00:19:23.290
who is a not a person who is
normally engaged in these

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.837
testing of alternatives says,
"Gentlemen,

00:19:25.837 --> 00:19:26.670
this is off the track.
 

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.935
This is philosophy of science,
this isn't what we really

00:19:28.935 --> 00:19:29.390
do."
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.472
And Szilard says,
"I'm not quarreling with

00:19:31.472 --> 00:19:32.558
third-rate scientists.
 

00:19:32.558 --> 00:19:32.763
Okay?
 

00:19:32.763 --> 00:19:34.769
I'm quarreling with first-rate
scientists."

00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:37.118
And then this guy writes in,
a little bit afterwards,

00:19:37.118 --> 00:19:39.470
and says, "So,
should I commit suicide?"

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:43.890
So you see people get kind of
stirred up about this stuff;

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.059
and there are some remarkably
arrogant people out there.

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:49.118
&gt;
 

00:19:49.118 --> 00:19:51.670
So where does this work and
where does it not work?

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.241
And by the way,
one of the best demonstrations

00:19:55.241 --> 00:19:59.924
of this method that I've ever
seen was when Tom Pollard gave

00:19:59.924 --> 00:20:04.450
his lecture in that half-credit
course for freshmen,

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:08.807
and Tom came in and described
how he had figured out how cells

00:20:08.807 --> 00:20:11.692
move,
how actin fibers are used in

00:20:11.692 --> 00:20:15.036
the motion of cells,
and it was just a tour de force

00:20:15.036 --> 00:20:17.769
of strong inference,
it worked like a charm.

00:20:17.769 --> 00:20:18.222
Okay?
 

00:20:18.222 --> 00:20:21.579
And it was all about cell
structure.

00:20:21.579 --> 00:20:23.180
So where does it work best?
 

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.640
Well what's the single
mechanism;

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.190
what's the structure?
 

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.920
That is where strong inference
really works well.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.347
It doesn't really work so well
where there are several

00:20:34.347 --> 00:20:36.684
different correct answers,
where you've got multiple

00:20:36.684 --> 00:20:37.740
causation going on.
 

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:41.008
That's often much more often
the case in ecology and

00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:44.470
evolution than it is in
molecular and cell biology,

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.038
and it's certainly much more
often the case in the social

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:50.970
sciences than it is in the
natural sciences.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.420
But it's a good philosophy.
 

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:52.670
Okay?
 

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.068
It's a good starting point.
 

00:20:54.068 --> 00:20:58.681
It's good to realize that
that's a good standard to set,

00:20:58.681 --> 00:21:03.460
and to see how far you can push
the process towards it.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.905
So, for example,
the genes in an environment

00:21:05.905 --> 00:21:07.670
interact to cause phenotypes.
 

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.594
So it's not just genes,
it's not just environment that

00:21:10.594 --> 00:21:12.140
are causing heart disease.
 

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.184
And you can use experiments and
hypotheses to get at these

00:21:16.184 --> 00:21:18.445
interactions;
and that's clearly an important

00:21:18.445 --> 00:21:19.990
point that we would like to know
about.

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.490
But when you look at all the
causes of heart disease,

00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:25.423
there are at least five or six,
and they're interacting with

00:21:25.423 --> 00:21:27.592
each other,
and when a person dies of a

00:21:27.592 --> 00:21:30.551
heart attack,
it is often difficult to say it

00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:34.630
was only for this reason that
they died of a heart attack.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:39.346
Now strong inference actually
won't work at all in a field

00:21:39.346 --> 00:21:42.575
like astronomy,
geology, paleontology or

00:21:42.575 --> 00:21:43.900
systematics.
 

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.000
And that's because we can't do
experiments.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.202
Nevertheless,
we can do observations that are

00:21:51.202 --> 00:21:55.118
so precise that they become
convincing.

00:21:55.118 --> 00:22:00.529
So there is a rigor in
descriptive science that is not

00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:05.430
captured by this paradigm of
strong inference.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.028
Okay?
 

00:22:07.028 --> 00:22:09.772
For example,
probably the most extreme

00:22:09.772 --> 00:22:11.848
example I know of is this.
 

00:22:11.848 --> 00:22:14.576
Quantum chromodynamics makes a
prediction for the fine

00:22:14.576 --> 00:22:18.227
structure constant,
to so many decimal places that

00:22:18.227 --> 00:22:23.093
it predicts it to within half of
the diameter of a piece of

00:22:23.093 --> 00:22:26.253
tissue paper,
compared with the distance

00:22:26.253 --> 00:22:28.990
between Washington DC and San
Francisco.

00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:32.240
Now if a theory is able to make
a prediction quantitatively,

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:35.616
which is that precise,
you're not going to ask some

00:22:35.616 --> 00:22:39.400
kind of high-faluting
experimental verification of it.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.483
You're just going to measure
the fine structure constant and

00:22:42.483 --> 00:22:45.150
if it measures down to that many
decimal places,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:46.710
you're going to scratch your
head and say,

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.192
"Well, you know,
I think maybe the theory has

00:22:48.192 --> 00:22:48.858
got something to it.
 

00:22:48.858 --> 00:22:53.230
It's capturing something
important about the nature of

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:54.548
reality."
 

00:22:54.548 --> 00:22:57.622
Things like continental drift
and the Big Bang are accepted

00:22:57.622 --> 00:22:59.529
without experimental
confirmation.

00:22:59.529 --> 00:23:01.970
By the way, thank God we're not
doing experiments on the Big

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:02.259
Bang.
 

00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:06.960
That would be a little bit
exciting &gt;

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.548
if we were doing that one.
 

00:23:08.548 --> 00:23:13.924
But you might want to think
that if strong inference is the

00:23:13.924 --> 00:23:18.417
paradigm of good science,
then why is it that we are now

00:23:18.417 --> 00:23:22.087
so happy with the notion that
continental drift is going on

00:23:22.087 --> 00:23:24.240
and that the Big Bang occurred?
 

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.059
And I think that what you'll
find is that there is a theory

00:23:28.059 --> 00:23:30.821
about how it works,
and the theory makes a long

00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:33.179
series of predictions,
and many, many of these

00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:35.868
predictions have now been
confirmed by observation;

00:23:35.868 --> 00:23:38.578
not by experiment but just by
observation.

00:23:38.578 --> 00:23:43.098
And if you line up other
alternative theories,

00:23:43.098 --> 00:23:46.960
for say the location of the
continents on the planet,

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.308
or say the residual cosmic
radiation,

00:23:51.308 --> 00:23:53.298
or something like that for the
Big Bang,

00:23:53.298 --> 00:23:55.630
you'll find that the
alternatives don't do so well.

00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:03.386
Okay, now there is another
possibility for what goes on in

00:24:03.386 --> 00:24:06.748
science, and that is this
romantic paradigm of

00:24:06.748 --> 00:24:08.690
revolutionary science.
 

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:13.557
And if you would like to read a
piece of glorious philosophical

00:24:13.557 --> 00:24:16.537
rhetoric,
read Thomas Kuhn's 1962 book,

00:24:16.537 --> 00:24:19.910
The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.813
Kuhn was a guy who had been a
physicist and then he went into

00:24:23.813 --> 00:24:25.440
the history of science.
 

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.098
He was a Junior Fellow at
Harvard.

00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:32.046
He decided to make the
Copernican to Galilean- the

00:24:32.046 --> 00:24:36.526
Copernican revolution;
so overthrowing the Ptolemaic

00:24:36.526 --> 00:24:40.285
structure of the universe and
moving to a model of the

00:24:40.285 --> 00:24:44.609
universe in which the sun was at
the center and the earth went

00:24:44.609 --> 00:24:47.807
around the sun,
and then eventually to the

00:24:47.807 --> 00:24:51.942
Galilean and subsequent model of
the universe in which the earth

00:24:51.942 --> 00:24:55.029
is a small planet circling an
obscure star,

00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:59.400
on the fringe of a thoroughly
normal galaxy,

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.009
which is one of billions of
galaxies.

00:25:02.009 --> 00:25:06.545
So that kind of change in world
view he described as a

00:25:06.545 --> 00:25:08.598
scientific revolution.
 

00:25:08.598 --> 00:25:12.008
And he described it as a
paradigm shift,

00:25:12.008 --> 00:25:16.640
a shift in the whole way that
we look at the world.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.808
And there have been some others.
 

00:25:18.808 --> 00:25:19.150
Okay?
 

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.868
So Newton to Einstein,
plate tectonics.

00:25:21.868 --> 00:25:25.163
And the idea here is that the
paradigm shift is so profound

00:25:25.163 --> 00:25:28.630
that people are not able to
communicate across the divide,

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.950
so that once you have seen,
for example,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.861
that the continents are in
motion, you can actually no

00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:36.498
longer have an intelligent
conversation with your

00:25:36.498 --> 00:25:39.519
geological colleague who doesn't
realize that yet,

00:25:39.519 --> 00:25:43.904
because it's such a deep change
in the way that you look at the

00:25:43.904 --> 00:25:44.470
world.
 

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.446
That one actually--I watched
some of these people communicate

00:25:47.446 --> 00:25:51.682
across that divide;
so that wasn't really that kind

00:25:51.682 --> 00:25:53.640
of paradigm shift.
 

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.538
If that really is true,
then the old generation has to

00:25:57.538 --> 00:26:01.583
die out before the insights of
the new generation can be

00:26:01.583 --> 00:26:02.538
accepted.
 

00:26:02.538 --> 00:26:07.720
And if you are a young
revolutionary,

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.326
and you're getting a lot of
resistance from the older

00:26:10.326 --> 00:26:12.536
generation,
this might be some kind of

00:26:12.536 --> 00:26:16.011
solace, that actually you're
younger than they are and you're

00:26:16.011 --> 00:26:17.750
just going to outlive them.
 

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:18.132
Okay?
 

00:26:18.132 --> 00:26:22.259
Well I think that this is an
interesting set of issues,

00:26:22.259 --> 00:26:25.926
because somebody like Charles
Darwin really was a

00:26:25.926 --> 00:26:27.380
revolutionary.
 

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.428
There's been nobody who has
more profoundly changed the way

00:26:31.428 --> 00:26:35.685
that we think about the human
condition and what a human being

00:26:35.685 --> 00:26:37.920
is and so forth than Darwin.
 

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.940
But Darwin didn't want to be a
revolutionary.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.207
He wanted to be a normal member
of the British upper

00:26:44.207 --> 00:26:47.089
middle-class,
who wasn't upsetting anybody.

00:26:47.089 --> 00:26:48.740
&gt;
 

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.190
And he was conservative.
 

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:55.531
He wanted to be acceptable to
the establishment,

00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:59.017
and so he went through rather
elaborate maneuvers,

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:01.720
to try to make himself
digestible.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.214
Steve Gould was not really a
revolutionary but he wanted to

00:27:05.214 --> 00:27:06.358
appear to be one.
 

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:09.960
If you go back and you look at
what Steve's written about his

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.755
encounter with Kuhn,
in 1965, when he was a graduate

00:27:13.755 --> 00:27:17.250
student at Columbia,
you can see that he was seduced

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.640
by this idea that revolutionary
science is great science,

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.230
and that's what he wanted to
become.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.292
So he had important ideas;
there's no question that Steve

00:27:25.292 --> 00:27:28.064
Gould had important ideas,
but he wanted to sell them as a

00:27:28.064 --> 00:27:31.051
paradigm shift that would change
profoundly the way that

00:27:31.051 --> 00:27:34.738
everybody looked at the world,
and he actually overshot his

00:27:34.738 --> 00:27:37.759
mark and he created exaggerated
expectations.

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:40.953
So there was a bit of a
backlash against him because he

00:27:40.953 --> 00:27:44.150
was making claims that couldn't
really be supported.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:46.380
And that is,
I think, kind of unfortunate

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.500
because he had some important
ideas;

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.880
just oversold them.
 

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.400
So is it worth worrying about
being a revolutionary scientist?

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.190
Well I think we all have to be
a bit modest about whether we

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:04.061
can tell whether we're currently
making a contribution that's

00:28:04.061 --> 00:28:07.308
going to make any difference at
all.

00:28:07.308 --> 00:28:12.490
And the only thing that decides
is history, and history chews

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:16.028
this stuff over long after we
are dead.

00:28:16.028 --> 00:28:19.327
So it's really only history
that can identify a major

00:28:19.327 --> 00:28:20.660
scientific advance.
 

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.314
It's very difficult,
right in the middle of the

00:28:23.314 --> 00:28:25.450
generation that's experiencing
it,

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.528
even though it might have
gotten a Nobel Prize,

00:28:27.528 --> 00:28:29.808
to be sure that it's really
that fundamental,

00:28:29.808 --> 00:28:33.990
because it just takes
perspective and time.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.154
So if you're on the scene and
you're enmeshed in the process,

00:28:38.154 --> 00:28:41.417
your own estimate of the
contribution is kind of

00:28:41.417 --> 00:28:43.876
unreliable;
and, to go back to Chamberlain,

00:28:43.876 --> 00:28:45.660
we're all in love with our own
ideas,

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.488
and so we all have a tendency
to think that what we're doing

00:28:49.488 --> 00:28:51.368
is the greatest thing ever.
 

00:28:51.368 --> 00:28:54.266
And that's simply just not
necessarily true,

00:28:54.266 --> 00:28:58.509
and it's kind of hard to tell
until history takes its course.

00:28:58.509 --> 00:29:03.721
So the best way to cause a
change is to take the current

00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:08.650
state of affairs and push it as
far as it will go.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:14.068
So taking the current state of
science,

00:29:14.068 --> 00:29:17.528
what Kuhn might call boring,
normal science,

00:29:17.528 --> 00:29:21.347
and pushing its limits and
discovering where they break

00:29:21.347 --> 00:29:24.390
down is probably the most
effective way,

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.140
in the long-term,
to really cause major

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:28.660
scientific advance.
 

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.363
So, for example,
the Michelson-Morley

00:29:31.363 --> 00:29:33.445
experiments,
where they were simply

00:29:33.445 --> 00:29:36.009
measuring the speed of light in
the direction of the earth's

00:29:36.009 --> 00:29:38.400
movement around the sun and in
the other direction,

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.710
and they discovered that it was
the same in both directions,

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:44.529
even though they knew that the
earth was moving around the sun

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:47.410
at hundreds of thousands of
miles per hour,

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.259
is a very good example of this.
 

00:29:49.259 --> 00:29:51.509
That caused a crisis.
 

00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:55.916
And there haven't been very
many experiments in the history

00:29:55.916 --> 00:29:59.259
of biology that have had that
kind of impact,

00:29:59.259 --> 00:30:01.538
but there have been a few.
 

00:30:01.538 --> 00:30:05.990
The Avery experiments in 1945
identifying DNA as the genetic

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:09.839
substance in bacteria are a good
example of that.

00:30:09.839 --> 00:30:11.410
There have been some others.
 

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:16.372
So if you make a premature
attempt at revolution and you

00:30:16.372 --> 00:30:20.342
overshoot the mark,
then the attempt tends to

00:30:20.342 --> 00:30:23.410
collapse under its own weight.
 

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:29.130
There's a whole cottage
industry of criticisms of Kuhn.

00:30:29.130 --> 00:30:34.016
You can find conferences that
have gone out and found maybe

00:30:34.016 --> 00:30:38.733
seventy or eighty different
senses in which Kuhn used the

00:30:38.733 --> 00:30:42.019
word paradigm in that
paper.

00:30:42.019 --> 00:30:44.656
So I would say that whether
it's worth worrying about

00:30:44.656 --> 00:30:47.640
revolutionary science at all,
or whether it's worth trying to

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.517
be a revolutionary scientist,
is an issue which is open to

00:30:50.517 --> 00:30:51.980
pretty serious discussion.
 

00:30:55.599 --> 00:30:58.318
Now what about post-modernism?
 

00:30:58.318 --> 00:31:05.038
Post-modernism is variously
defined, and some of it I think

00:31:05.038 --> 00:31:09.788
is quite interesting and worth
reading.

00:31:09.788 --> 00:31:12.193
When people say Post-Modern,
they usually think of the

00:31:12.193 --> 00:31:14.598
French School of Literary
Criticism and Philosophy;

00:31:14.598 --> 00:31:19.205
they think of Jacques Derrida,
they think of Lacan,

00:31:19.205 --> 00:31:21.509
they think of Foucault.
 

00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:25.203
And there are insights that
those guys have had,

00:31:25.203 --> 00:31:29.528
some of which I think should be
part of the intellectual

00:31:29.528 --> 00:31:32.828
equipment of any well-educated
person.

00:31:32.828 --> 00:31:36.067
And particularly among that
crew I particularly admire

00:31:36.067 --> 00:31:38.613
Foucault because Foucault,
for example,

00:31:38.613 --> 00:31:42.480
discusses things like is the
definition of madness a function

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.380
of the current power structure
of society?

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.310
I think that's an interesting
question and I think that

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:54.190
there's some historical evidence
that it is, to a certain degree.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:56.930
So I think there are important
issues there,

00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:59.500
and most of that I think has to
do much more with literary

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.252
criticism in the social sciences
than it does with the natural

00:32:02.252 --> 00:32:02.838
sciences.
 

00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:07.355
But the people who got into
this decided that they might

00:32:07.355 --> 00:32:11.953
want to turn this armament of
literary ideas onto natural

00:32:11.953 --> 00:32:12.940
science.
 

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.775
And they picked up on Kuhn,
because if you could show that

00:32:16.775 --> 00:32:21.150
science consists of a series of
revolutionary paradigm shifts,

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:24.795
that would mean that science is
more socially constructed than

00:32:24.795 --> 00:32:26.170
empirically verified.
 

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:26.541
Okay?
 

00:32:26.541 --> 00:32:30.711
So it's like one paradigm is
one period of mass hysteria,

00:32:30.711 --> 00:32:35.548
and then the next paradigm is
another period of mass hysteria;

00:32:35.548 --> 00:32:37.500
and there isn't anything going
on here,

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.722
other than that people are
tending to agree with each other

00:32:40.722 --> 00:32:43.960
on the nature of reality,
but then they're changing their

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.339
minds.
 

00:32:44.339 --> 00:32:45.500
Okay?
 

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.154
Well most of science actually
doesn't proceed according to

00:32:50.154 --> 00:32:53.420
Kuhn's model of revolutionary
science.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.970
It's going by the accretion of
well-tested hypotheses.

00:32:56.970 --> 00:32:59.180
They're mostly much smaller
than a paradigm.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.269
It's walking with small steps.
 

00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:06.182
So it's not built up the way
that say Kuhn's Copernican

00:33:06.182 --> 00:33:09.548
Revolution would make it look
like.

00:33:09.548 --> 00:33:13.762
And science does succeed in
describing nature in ways that

00:33:13.762 --> 00:33:16.348
don't change as science
advances.

00:33:16.348 --> 00:33:18.410
So you can ask yourself
questions like this.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.660
In what sense was Newton still
right after Einstein?

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.720
Well he was right enough to get
people onto the moon.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:30.156
You didn't need the correct,
the Einsteinian corrections to

00:33:30.156 --> 00:33:32.598
get man to the moon.
 

00:33:32.598 --> 00:33:39.660
I think that at that scale
you're off by a matter of meters

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.529
or seconds, rather than by
kilometers;

00:33:44.529 --> 00:33:45.980
things like that.
 

00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.811
In what way is Darwin still
right after the rediscovery of

00:33:48.811 --> 00:33:50.848
Mendel's laws of transmission
genetics?

00:33:50.848 --> 00:33:54.588
Well we're all in a big frenzy
of honoring Darwin's 200^(th)

00:33:54.588 --> 00:33:57.824
Anniversary this year;
and he was obviously clearly

00:33:57.824 --> 00:34:01.068
right on some very important
points, and wrong on some

00:34:01.068 --> 00:34:04.558
others, and science manages to
distinguish that stuff.

00:34:04.558 --> 00:34:09.204
So the point is that when the
natural science community gets

00:34:09.204 --> 00:34:12.728
down to the task,
and it focuses long and hard on

00:34:12.728 --> 00:34:17.273
an important point,
it can actually tell you pretty

00:34:17.273 --> 00:34:21.018
well what the nature of reality
is;

00:34:21.018 --> 00:34:27.496
and it's not that we're dealing
with successions of mass

00:34:27.496 --> 00:34:31.500
hysteria on something like that.
 

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.822
Now that said,
one of--there are moderate

00:34:34.822 --> 00:34:39.280
post-modernists who will say,
"Yes, but the social and

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.885
political context does bias the
kinds of questions that are

00:34:42.885 --> 00:34:43.880
tested."
 

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.820
And I think there's some truth
to that.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:49.443
And I think there's some truth
to the idea that if science was

00:34:49.443 --> 00:34:52.344
dominated by women,
that they would be testing a

00:34:52.344 --> 00:34:55.820
different set of questions than
if it were dominated by men.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.036
And I think that if it were
dominated by Marxists,

00:34:58.036 --> 00:35:00.659
that they would be testing
different sets of questions than

00:35:00.659 --> 00:35:02.469
if it were dominated by
Capitalists.

00:35:02.469 --> 00:35:05.900
But I think that the objective
weighing of alternatives is

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.333
going to cause all of those
different traditions to arrive

00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:11.320
at the same point eventually.
 

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.983
Because Mother Nature doesn't
care whether you're a man or a

00:35:13.983 --> 00:35:15.699
woman, or a Marxist or a
Capitalist;

00:35:15.699 --> 00:35:19.021
Mother Nature just is,
and she's going to give you

00:35:19.021 --> 00:35:19.699
answers.
 

00:35:23.719 --> 00:35:29.047
Now science consists of shared
knowledge--that's what we can

00:35:29.047 --> 00:35:34.014
agree on--and that doesn't mean
that science is a social

00:35:34.014 --> 00:35:35.280
construct.
 

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:37.773
Science is accumulated by
humans having social

00:35:37.773 --> 00:35:40.213
interactions,
but that doesn't mean that it's

00:35:40.213 --> 00:35:40.989
arbitrary.
 

00:35:40.989 --> 00:35:45.489
So it's making progress,
and it's expanding the part of

00:35:45.489 --> 00:35:51.960
reality we can agree on,
and eventually reality has been

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:58.090
checked by so many methods that
we converge;

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:04.126
any independent intellectual
tradition would converge on

00:36:04.126 --> 00:36:07.199
reality as it actually is.
 

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:11.289
And that doesn't matter whether
you would start this process

00:36:11.289 --> 00:36:14.617
coming out of a Buddhist
tradition or a Christian

00:36:14.617 --> 00:36:17.956
tradition or whatever;
you would eventually end up

00:36:17.956 --> 00:36:20.916
with quantum chromodynamics in
physics, and you would

00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:23.820
eventually end up with cell
biology and evolution in

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.559
biology.
 

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.666
I think that there's a lot of
fun that the philosophers of

00:36:34.666 --> 00:36:38.409
science have in arguing about
what scientists actually do and

00:36:38.409 --> 00:36:40.469
what's the best way to do it.
 

00:36:40.469 --> 00:36:43.681
But I think the thing that the
scientist needs to take away

00:36:43.681 --> 00:36:47.059
from it is just agreeing that we
can all be critical about the

00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:50.396
hypotheses we pose,
and that the tests that they

00:36:50.396 --> 00:36:54.081
have, have to withstand,
and the ones that we can agree

00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:55.539
on they have withstood.
 

00:36:55.539 --> 00:37:00.373
If we can agree that we're
going to be critical of each

00:37:00.373 --> 00:37:02.527
other,
and we will do so in a

00:37:02.527 --> 00:37:05.150
civilized way,
and we will insist that we will

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:07.110
only accept constructive
criticism,

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:11.001
and we will agree that we will
only try to give constructive

00:37:11.001 --> 00:37:13.978
criticism,
because we want to have this

00:37:13.978 --> 00:37:17.088
play of alternatives,
and we know that's the only way

00:37:17.088 --> 00:37:19.340
we can get to an accurate
description of reality,

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.869
then we can do good science.
 

00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:25.956
And I don't think that we have
to get much fancier than that

00:37:25.956 --> 00:37:29.059
agreement, in philosophical
terms.

00:37:29.059 --> 00:37:30.788
Now if we want to be
philosophers of science,

00:37:30.788 --> 00:37:32.360
we can go and get as fancy as
we want;

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.679
that's another issue,
that's another field.

00:37:34.679 --> 00:37:37.757
But what the working scientist
at least needs to do is to

00:37:37.757 --> 00:37:40.340
realize that something like this
is going on.

00:37:45.139 --> 00:37:47.820
Okay.
 

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:53.449
I'll now give you Western
philosophy in about two minutes.

00:37:53.449 --> 00:37:58.585
Okay, so philosophy starts out
as being essentially what we

00:37:58.585 --> 00:38:03.809
would now call education in
general, learning in general.

00:38:03.809 --> 00:38:07.721
And then parts of it become
mature, and they have then

00:38:07.721 --> 00:38:12.150
significant elements that are no
longer subject to debate.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.159
So they split off.
 

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:18.639
The first thing that goes off
is math, then physics.

00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:23.751
So Math gets split off by,
arguably oh second century BC,

00:38:23.751 --> 00:38:25.030
I would say.
 

00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:28.643
Physics gets split off by
roughly the time of Galileo,

00:38:28.643 --> 00:38:30.619
between Galileo and Newton.
 

00:38:30.619 --> 00:38:32.650
And of course Astronomy quickly
follows.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:36.197
And then with Lavoisier and so
forth, the end of the eighteenth

00:38:36.197 --> 00:38:38.030
century, Chemistry splits off.
 

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:41.311
Then Geology becomes a special
subject, pretty much in the

00:38:41.311 --> 00:38:43.730
nineteenth century,
and so does Biology.

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.717
So what is then left in this
field of knowledge that we call

00:38:47.717 --> 00:38:50.489
philosophy, that used to be
everything?

00:38:50.489 --> 00:38:51.300
Okay?
 

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:54.324
Well it consists largely of a
set of very interesting issues,

00:38:54.324 --> 00:38:56.039
about which we remain
uncertain.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.576
So given that,
should scientists,

00:39:01.576 --> 00:39:04.230
who largely agree on how to
proceed,

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:07.853
accept dicta that are handed
down by philosophers who often

00:39:07.853 --> 00:39:10.539
don't agree on what they're
taking about?

00:39:10.539 --> 00:39:13.471
Well I would say that
scientists shouldn't accept

00:39:13.471 --> 00:39:15.670
simple recipes from
philosophers,

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:18.650
especially if they haven't done
science themselves,

00:39:18.650 --> 00:39:21.340
but they should listen to
reason from those who have the

00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.639
perspective of standing outside
the endeavor.

00:39:23.639 --> 00:39:27.369
So one should not dismiss the
philosophers out of hand.

00:39:27.369 --> 00:39:29.719
They're often very bright
people who are making good

00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:32.057
points,
but they may not have the

00:39:32.057 --> 00:39:35.514
practical experience to
understand exactly what

00:39:35.514 --> 00:39:37.920
difference their points make.
 

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.043
Now the final thing that I'd
like to mention is a little bit

00:39:41.043 --> 00:39:42.050
about creativity.
 

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:45.340
So where do ideas come from?
 

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:50.679
And after all I've been talking
about science as a play of

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:54.782
alternatives,
and we have alternative models,

00:39:54.782 --> 00:39:58.980
alternative hypotheses that we
want to generate,

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.659
and that if we can get them
playing off of each other,

00:40:01.659 --> 00:40:05.469
then we can use that as a tool
to try to perceive reality.

00:40:05.469 --> 00:40:10.420
Well the best study of where
these ideas come from,

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:12.621
that I'm aware of,
is called The Psychology of

00:40:12.621 --> 00:40:14.409
invention in the Mathematical
Field,

00:40:14.409 --> 00:40:16.079
by Jacques Hadamard.
 

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:18.739
And Hadamard was a student of
Henri Poincaré,

00:40:18.739 --> 00:40:21.599
a great French mathematician
and physicist,

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:26.454
and Hadamard's own personal
research agenda was number

00:40:26.454 --> 00:40:28.998
theory;
he wanted to understand the

00:40:28.998 --> 00:40:32.309
distribution of the prime
numbers on the real line.

00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:36.932
But he was also fascinated by
where do people get these great

00:40:36.932 --> 00:40:37.550
ideas?
 

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.896
After all, he had hung around
Poincaré,

00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:42.034
he knew him,
and he had more or less grown

00:40:42.034 --> 00:40:44.849
up at the time that Einstein was
having his ideas.

00:40:44.849 --> 00:40:47.585
And so he went and he talked to
Poincaré

00:40:47.585 --> 00:40:50.918
and he talked to Einstein,
and then he wrote down what he

00:40:50.918 --> 00:40:53.059
discovered, from his interviews.
 

00:40:53.059 --> 00:40:57.760
So it's more or less a history
by interview.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.378
So Poincaré
described a case of stepping

00:41:02.378 --> 00:41:05.920
onto the bus in Paris,
and he said, "You know,

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.110
I had just submerged myself in
this problem."

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:11.380
It had to do with an issue,
an abstruse mathematical issue,

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:13.409
having to do with quadratic
forms.

00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:17.635
So Poincaré
just sinks as deeply as he can

00:41:17.635 --> 00:41:20.255
into this,
and he gets totally frustrated,

00:41:20.255 --> 00:41:23.110
and he just can't go anywhere
with it and he puts it aside.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.965
And about two months later he
is stepping onto the bus in

00:41:25.965 --> 00:41:29.230
Paris when suddenly the idea for
the solution appears to him,

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.268
full-formed in his head,
and he says,

00:41:32.268 --> 00:41:34.438
"You know,
when I sat down and I started

00:41:34.438 --> 00:41:37.407
just making a few notes,
I knew that when I got home I

00:41:37.407 --> 00:41:40.230
would be able to write the whole
thing out."

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:43.480
It's almost like Coleridge
writing Kubla Khan.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.507
So if that darn neighboring
minister hadn't come to

00:41:47.507 --> 00:41:51.005
Coleridge's door,
we would have another ten pages

00:41:51.005 --> 00:41:54.009
of poetry like Kubla Khan,
because Coleridge got

00:41:54.009 --> 00:41:55.679
interrupted in the middle.
 

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.349
Poincaré
was pretty sure he could get

00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:58.670
the whole thing out,
and he did.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:02.492
He went out and he went home
and he wrote down the paper on

00:42:02.492 --> 00:42:03.679
quadratic forms.
 

00:42:03.679 --> 00:42:07.802
And similarly Kekulé
had this dream of a snake

00:42:07.802 --> 00:42:09.230
biting its tail.
 

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:12.574
And Einstein described similar
things, coming up with special

00:42:12.574 --> 00:42:13.300
relativity.
 

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.543
And so the sequence basically
is there has to be a period of

00:42:17.543 --> 00:42:19.842
hard work,
and you have to push yourself

00:42:19.842 --> 00:42:22.268
right to the limit,
trying to figure out the

00:42:22.268 --> 00:42:23.768
solution to some puzzle.
 

00:42:23.768 --> 00:42:27.952
Then you go to sleep,
and maybe the next morning,

00:42:27.952 --> 00:42:32.920
or maybe two months later,
something will occur to you.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.849
Your brain is processing
overnight.

00:42:34.849 --> 00:42:36.429
It is making connections.
 

00:42:36.429 --> 00:42:41.052
It's trying out all sorts of
things, and all of the clutter

00:42:41.052 --> 00:42:44.880
and bustle of every day is
getting in the way.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.181
And believe me,
now that we have iPhones,

00:42:47.181 --> 00:42:50.173
and we have Twittering,
there is a lot of clutter and

00:42:50.173 --> 00:42:52.880
bustle that gets in the way
during the day;

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.501
and some of you are probably
surfing the web while I am

00:42:57.501 --> 00:42:58.699
saying this.
 

00:42:58.699 --> 00:43:00.903
So this point,
that if you can simply put all

00:43:00.903 --> 00:43:03.309
that stuff aside and really
concentrate hard,

00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:07.550
and then let your subconscious
do the job,

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.039
you will be surprised at what
you come up with.

00:43:11.039 --> 00:43:14.371
We are all probably more
creative than we give ourselves

00:43:14.371 --> 00:43:15.159
credit for.
 

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:20.880
So these things don't happen to
anybody.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.327
They only happen to those who
have prepared themselves by

00:43:25.327 --> 00:43:26.519
working hard.
 

00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:33.914
So the overview of this is
basically that creative new

00:43:33.914 --> 00:43:37.929
ideas, about how the world
works, can come from anywhere.

00:43:37.929 --> 00:43:42.670
So this contest of alterative
hypotheses in science,

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.469
those new ideas can come from
anywhere,

00:43:44.469 --> 00:43:48.465
but they most often emerge from
the minds of people who have

00:43:48.465 --> 00:43:51.380
worked very hard to understand
something.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:54.809
So that's the raw material.
 

00:43:54.809 --> 00:43:58.365
And, by the way,
this raw material usually

00:43:58.365 --> 00:44:01.750
emerges in the minds of young
people.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:05.304
It doesn't so frequently emerge
in the minds of the old guys

00:44:05.304 --> 00:44:06.510
with white beards.
 

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.590
Okay?
 

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.880
It's something that emerges in
the minds of young peoples.

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.411
And particularly in math and in
physics, those people are often

00:44:15.411 --> 00:44:17.750
between the ages of 20 and 30.
 

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:21.007
It appears that in biology
often they're between the ages

00:44:21.007 --> 00:44:23.679
of 30 and 40,
just because it's a different

00:44:23.679 --> 00:44:27.159
kind of subject and it takes
more background preparation.

00:44:27.159 --> 00:44:30.653
So those ideas are then
subjected to rigorous tests,

00:44:30.653 --> 00:44:34.217
and the ones that remain
standing become what we call

00:44:34.217 --> 00:44:35.039
science.
 

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.882
So the importance of new
scientific ideas--gosh,

00:44:40.882 --> 00:44:43.010
I went through and I managed to
change everything,

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:45.139
but I didn't manage to change
this one thing.

00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:49.090
And I have one or two minutes,
so I think I can change it;

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:51.079
I'm going to just pull up that
last line.

00:45:03.949 --> 00:45:05.690
What's important and what's not
important?

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:08.992
Well something is important if
it changes a big chunk of our

00:45:08.992 --> 00:45:11.735
view of the world,
and it's not so important if it

00:45:11.735 --> 00:45:13.750
changes only a very small chunk.
 

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:18.224
So the bigger the change to the
way that people think about the

00:45:18.224 --> 00:45:21.760
nature of reality,
the more important the idea.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.519
Next time I'm going to talk
about ecology;

00:45:25.519 --> 00:45:27.119
we'll start into that.
 

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:29.869
The rest of the course is
ecology and behavior.

00:45:29.869 --> 00:45:34.260
And anybody who would like
lunch today, that's possible.

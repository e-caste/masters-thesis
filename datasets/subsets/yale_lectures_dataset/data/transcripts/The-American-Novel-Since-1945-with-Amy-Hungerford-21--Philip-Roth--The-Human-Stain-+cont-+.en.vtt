00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:02.730
Professor Amy
Hungerford: All right.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.259
So, today I'm going to give my
second and final lecture on

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.941
The Human Stain.
My first lecture focused on

00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:14.626
identity, and my final argument
about the novel in relation to

00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:19.157
the question of identity is that
the first half of the novel

00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:23.920
comes down on the definition of
identity through secrecy,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.066
that what makes you who you
are--anyway what makes Coleman

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:33.840
the person he is--is his
secrecy.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.510
"Who he really was was his
secret."

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.760
So, I did that little reading
of that phrase.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.420
Today I want to talk about what
happens in the second half of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.450
the novel to the question of
secrecy,

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.579
and how that relates,
then, into the question of

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.089
desire and narrative.
So, that's where I'm going

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.458
today.
If you'll recall,

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:03.854
on page 47 (and I don't think
we need to turn to this),

00:01:03.854 --> 00:01:09.950
desire is said to be generated
by the human discrepancies,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.781
the difference between Faunia,
with her illiterate vocabulary,

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.169
and Coleman,
with the vocabularies of two

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:22.610
ancient languages and his
language of English.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.359
So, discrepancy,
difference, is understood as

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.033
the engine of desire.
So, this shouldn't be

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:34.030
surprising, when you think about
what desire is.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.013
Many psychological theories of
desire agree on one thing,

00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:43.730
and that is that desire is
reaching towards a lack.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.914
Desire is generated by lack,
so you can think of difference

00:01:46.914 --> 00:01:49.220
as one version of what it means
to lack.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.720
What you are not,
you then desire;

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.750
what you have not,
you then desire.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.660
So, you don't desire that thing
which you already have.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.066
So, it's just a simple
structure of desire that I want

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.626
you to keep in mind.
Now, I want to note,

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:08.014
in the second half of the
novel, something that you

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:11.825
probably noticed.
At the beginning of Chapter 4,

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:17.060
we are plunged back in to
Nathan's first-person voice.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.322
So, that "I" of Nathan comes
back very strongly at the very

00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:24.900
beginning of that chapter.
We haven't seen it for a while.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.773
We've been embedded in Faunia
and Les and Delphine and

00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:34.688
Coleman, inside all their minds,
using that technique of free

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:38.009
indirect discourse,
where the narrative voice just,

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:42.482
sort of, seamlessly allows you
to look at the world through

00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:46.569
that character's eyes and in
that character's mind.

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.776
So, that technique is
highlighted as a

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:54.075
technique in Chapter 4 when we
are reminded so suddenly that

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:56.990
this is all being written by
Nathan,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.830
that the illusion of these
characters' voices is just that;

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.392
it's an illusion.
The second half of the novel,

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:08.224
then, sets up the source of the
story--how does Nathan know all

00:03:08.224 --> 00:03:11.809
that he knows to give us that
story--sets up the problem of

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.698
that source,
and then it finally answers it

00:03:15.698 --> 00:03:21.465
in the person of Ernestine Silk.
Ernestine, Coleman's sister,

00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:26.377
answers some of those basic
questions about Coleman's

00:03:26.377 --> 00:03:29.271
background,
first of all revealing his

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:32.776
racial secret simply by her
presence at the funeral and her

00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:36.150
resemblance to his daughter,
Lisa.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.678
So, her body is a kind of
revelation to Nathan,

00:03:39.678 --> 00:03:43.437
and then she fills in some
details that we can see

00:03:43.437 --> 00:03:48.270
recapitulate material that has
come in an imaginative form,

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.139
different imaginative form,
earlier in the novel.

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.031
So, I would note (and I
will come back to this point),

00:03:57.031 --> 00:04:00.550
Ernestine is kind of a stock
character.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.408
There are some characters in
this novel--Delphine,

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:09.573
to some extent Les,
and Ernestine-- who are

00:04:09.573 --> 00:04:13.439
stereotypes of one kind or
another.

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.561
There are various ways of
thinking about this problem in

00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.408
Roth's fiction,
but the critical way of

00:04:20.408 --> 00:04:24.079
thinking about is that his
fiction is uneven,

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:28.720
that he cannot somehow truly
inhabit the complexity of some

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.575
kinds of characters.
And he has said about his own

00:04:32.575 --> 00:04:36.259
work that he writes novels about
the lives of men,

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:40.191
very clearly masculine fiction,
so that should come as a

00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:43.648
surprise to none of you.
So, that's one way of

00:04:43.648 --> 00:04:47.453
understanding the sort of
clichÃ©d quality of

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:51.199
characters like Ernestine.
I'm going to offer a slightly

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:54.439
different way of understanding
that by the end of the lecture,

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:56.470
so be looking for that.
But, for now,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.370
I just want to focus on the
structure of the second half of

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.668
the novel,
setting up the problem of

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:05.360
knowledge and then producing a
part of an answer to it.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.433
But, even though you have that
partial answer,

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:12.463
there is still a residue of
fictionality within the logic of

00:05:12.463 --> 00:05:14.540
the novel.
Of course, it's all fiction.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.476
But, within the logic of the
novel, we know that there is a

00:05:18.476 --> 00:05:22.831
lot that Nathan is making up.
So, Ernestine's story doesn't

00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:26.870
get you Steena dancing at the
end of Coleman's bed,

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.211
for instance,
a very important scene in

00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:33.290
Nathan's construction of
Coleman.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.830
So, there are scenes like
that, that are purely the

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.914
product of Nathan's imagination.
You have the final spasm of

00:05:41.914 --> 00:05:48.150
this kind of imagining when
Nathan stands at Coleman's grave

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.916
and asks him to speak to him one
last time and tell him the story

00:05:54.916 --> 00:05:59.250
of telling Faunia his racial
secret.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.921
So, you have that last scene
where we enter fully in to the

00:06:02.921 --> 00:06:05.389
minds and voices of those
characters.

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:11.897
One question that you want to
ask, here, is how we should

00:06:11.897 --> 00:06:16.363
understand this move.
Is there something,

00:06:16.363 --> 00:06:22.216
perhaps, duplicitous about the
way Nathan suggests he's related

00:06:22.216 --> 00:06:28.490
to this enterprise of imagining?
We're told on page 337,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:35.851
right before that graveside
scene, that it was Ernestine's

00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:43.730
speaking to him that caused him
to be seized by his story.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.882
This is in the middle of the
page: "I was completely seized

00:06:47.882 --> 00:06:50.315
by his story,
by its end and by its

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:54.110
beginning, and then and there I
began this book."

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.840
So, we get an account of its
start.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.414
So, he's "seized" by the story.
It puts him in a position much

00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:05.525
like he is at the very beginning
of the told story that you've

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:10.267
just arrived at the end of,
when Coleman shows up at his

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:15.120
door demanding that he write the
story of the unjust dismissal

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.241
from Athena College.
So, there are two moments when

00:07:19.241 --> 00:07:23.290
Nathan claims to be seized by
Coleman and his story.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.670
It puts Nathan in a very
passive position.

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:30.867
It suggests that he's not the
active party here,

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:35.422
that somehow he has been drawn
into this enterprise,

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:39.709
into this narrative,
maybe against his will.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:46.688
I think you can see this as
duplicitous, so I want to look a

00:07:46.688 --> 00:07:51.120
little bit at how this is
duplicitous,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.795
and this is where desire comes
back into the braid of my

00:07:55.795 --> 00:08:00.163
argument.
There is a sentence on page 164

00:08:00.163 --> 00:08:04.149
I want to direct your attention
to.

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:11.923
Desire, that urge to inhabit or
fill the lack of whatever it is,

00:08:11.923 --> 00:08:18.709
has a structural relation to
language in Roth's work.

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:21.800
So, desire has a structural
relation to language.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.753
And I think there is no better
example of it--and there's

00:08:26.753 --> 00:08:31.353
perhaps no better example of
Roth's ecstatic sentence

00:08:31.353 --> 00:08:34.980
structure--than this sentence on
164,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.039
and I will read the whole of it.
It starts "The kid."

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:41.850
You see it about a quarter of
the way down,

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.260
halfway through a line,
"The kid."

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.820
This is about Faunia.
The kid,

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.145
whose existence became a
hallucination at seven,

00:08:51.145 --> 00:08:55.510
and a catastrophe at fourteen,
and a disaster after that,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:09:00.195
whose vocation is to be neither
a waitress nor a hooker nor a

00:09:00.195 --> 00:09:04.192
farmer nor a janitor,
but forever the stepdaughter to

00:09:04.192 --> 00:09:08.026
a lascivious stepfather and the
undefended offspring of a

00:09:08.026 --> 00:09:11.198
self-obsessed mother,
the kid, who mistrusts

00:09:11.198 --> 00:09:14.950
everyone, sees the con in
everyone and yet is protected

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.160
against nothing,
whose capacity to hold on

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.396
unintimidated is enormous,
and yet whose purchase on life

00:09:22.396 --> 00:09:25.320
is minute,
misfortune's favorite embattled

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.513
child, the kid to whom
everything loathsome that can

00:09:28.513 --> 00:09:32.207
happen has happened and whose
luck shows no sign of changing

00:09:32.207 --> 00:09:36.340
and yet who excites and arouses
him like nobody since Steena,

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:39.700
not the most but morally
speaking the least repellant

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:42.672
person he knows,
the one to whom he feels drawn

00:09:42.672 --> 00:09:46.226
because of having been aimed for
so long in the opposite

00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:49.132
direction,
because of all he has missed by

00:09:49.132 --> 00:09:52.634
going in the opposite direction,
and because the underlying

00:09:52.634 --> 00:09:55.714
feeling of rightness that
controlled him formerly is

00:09:55.714 --> 00:09:58.129
exactly what is propelling him
now,

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:02.044
the unlikely intimate with whom
he shares no less a spiritual

00:10:02.044 --> 00:10:04.931
than a physical union,
who is anything but a

00:10:04.931 --> 00:10:08.706
plaything, upon whom he flings
his body twice a week in order

00:10:08.706 --> 00:10:12.706
to sustain his animal nature,
who is more to him like a

00:10:12.706 --> 00:10:16.600
comrade in arms than anyone else
on earth.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.629
Wow.
That's quite a grammar.

00:10:19.629 --> 00:10:29.138
What you see in that sentence
is language trying to embody

00:10:29.138 --> 00:10:35.653
desire by its very excess.
It's acting out,

00:10:35.653 --> 00:10:42.679
formally, just how far Coleman
has to reach from where he was,

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:49.129
to arrive at Faunia as his
object of love and desire.

00:10:49.129 --> 00:10:53.609
And you see that missing lack
is thematized in the middle of

00:10:53.609 --> 00:10:56.873
this sentence:
"because of all he has missed

00:10:56.873 --> 00:10:59.909
by going in the opposite
direction."

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:04.683
She embodies everything he
isn't--and the grammar of that

00:11:04.683 --> 00:11:09.712
sentence relentlessly tries to
fill in, to reach towards who

00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:12.394
she is.
And that's why I think

00:11:12.394 --> 00:11:15.169
it's--it's a repeated noun
phrase;

00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:17.864
that's the grammar of his
sentence, a repeated noun

00:11:17.864 --> 00:11:21.113
phrase.
So, you just have piles of

00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:26.533
descriptions of Faunia,
and--now let me see if there

00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:31.919
is, no--there is no verb.
This is a sentence fragment.

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:36.090
People, this is a sentence
fragment.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:41.340
You can't find a verb for the
subject.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:46.230
So, it's quite a remarkable
feat of grammar,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:52.940
and it embodies the formal
quality of language as desire.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.254
But, it's more than just at
the level of grammar,

00:11:56.254 --> 00:11:59.697
or at the structural level of
language, that desire and

00:11:59.697 --> 00:12:04.383
language coincide.
It's also there in the way sex

00:12:04.383 --> 00:12:07.885
is imagined as
anti-metaphorical,

00:12:07.885 --> 00:12:14.345
if you look on page 203.
This is when Faunia is dancing

00:12:14.345 --> 00:12:21.123
for Coleman, and she insists,
when Coleman wants it to mean

00:12:21.123 --> 00:12:28.252
something--I guess she is just
about to dance for him--when he

00:12:28.252 --> 00:12:32.810
wants their sex to mean
something,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.879
she says, "No.
It's just what it is."

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:37.617
"He said to her,
'This is more than sex' and

00:12:37.617 --> 00:12:39.910
flatly she replied,
'No, it's not.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:45.419
You just forgot what sex is.
This is sex all by itself.

00:12:45.419 --> 00:12:49.799
Don't fuck it up by pretending
it's something else.'

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:53.882
" What Coleman's urge is,
is to use language to make sex

00:12:53.882 --> 00:12:58.409
into something other than it is,
to make meaning out of it.

00:12:58.409 --> 00:13:02.889
That's a fundamentally
linguistic enterprise.

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:09.477
By insisting that it can't be
made into something else,

00:13:09.477 --> 00:13:17.042
it puts sex not so much outside
of language, as it elevates sex

00:13:17.042 --> 00:13:23.250
to the equal of language.
So, just as the grammar of the

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:27.966
sentence reaches out to fill
that lack, sex does that,

00:13:27.966 --> 00:13:31.123
too.
But it doesn't require the

00:13:31.123 --> 00:13:36.580
resources of language to be
successful, so you don't need

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.132
the language.
Really, all you need is sex to

00:13:41.132 --> 00:13:46.020
produce that human connection
that desire seeks.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:53.122
So, it elevates sex.
Sex is the analog to

00:13:53.122 --> 00:13:55.889
writing in other ways,
too.

00:13:55.889 --> 00:14:03.169
On page 37, Nathan talks about
sex as "the mania to repeat the

00:14:03.169 --> 00:14:10.448
act," and he also talks about
the language tasks that go along

00:14:10.448 --> 00:14:14.133
with it.
This is on the top of 37,

00:14:14.133 --> 00:14:18.909
when he is talking about why he
withdrew from life:

00:14:18.909 --> 00:14:21.890
I couldn't meet the costs
of its clamoring anymore,

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.700
could no longer marshal the
wit,

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.157
the strength,
the patience,

00:14:25.157 --> 00:14:27.063
the illusion,
the irony, the ardor,

00:14:27.063 --> 00:14:29.912
the egotism,
the resilience or the toughness

00:14:29.912 --> 00:14:33.250
or the shrewdness or the
falseness, the dissembling,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.024
the dual being,
the erotic

00:14:35.024 --> 00:14:39.427
professionalism to deal
with its array of misleading and

00:14:39.427 --> 00:14:44.125
contradictory meanings.
So, sex always comes along with

00:14:44.125 --> 00:14:47.467
those meanings,
and Nathan could not separate

00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:51.798
out the two in the way that
Coleman succeeds in doing with

00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:54.799
Faunia,
in finding an illiterate woman.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:59.242
I think it's her illiteracy,
in a sense, that enables the

00:14:59.242 --> 00:15:04.338
separation of sex from language.
But that "mania to repeat the

00:15:04.338 --> 00:15:08.389
act" looks a lot,
actually, like Roth's writing.

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:11.919
Roth is an extremely
repetitious writer,

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:15.187
across his novels.
His novels often engage the

00:15:15.187 --> 00:15:18.101
same kinds of characters,
sometimes the same character:

00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:19.990
lots of Nathan Zuckerman
novels.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:23.452
Even the ones that are not
Nathan Zuckerman novels look

00:15:23.452 --> 00:15:26.607
like Nathan Zuckerman novels.
You usually have someone who

00:15:26.607 --> 00:15:30.830
looks like Nathan.
The women often look the same.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:35.114
They often rant in similar ways.
So, there is something about

00:15:35.114 --> 00:15:39.419
Roth's writing that is close to
that mania to repeat the act;

00:15:39.419 --> 00:15:41.620
so, there you get that
parallelism again.

00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:51.294
So, the distance between
one person and another is

00:15:51.294 --> 00:15:56.289
crossed by language and by sex
in two equal tracks.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:59.511
But it's also crossed,
in this novel,

00:15:59.511 --> 00:16:04.178
by the imagination.
And this is where the entering

00:16:04.178 --> 00:16:07.710
into Coleman's story comes into
play.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.604
Now, you will have noticed,
at a few jarring points,

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:17.690
that suddenly you'll be in free
indirect discourse,

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.047
in the third person,
and suddenly the "I" of that

00:16:20.047 --> 00:16:22.929
character appears.
And there's an example on 165.

00:16:22.929 --> 00:16:27.220
This is Faunia,
at the bottom of the page.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.700
She is thinking about the crow.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.177
That crow's voice.
She remembers it at all hours

00:16:37.177 --> 00:16:40.299
day or night,
awake, sleeping or insomniac.

00:16:40.299 --> 00:16:43.166
Had a strange voice,
not like the voice of other

00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:46.520
crows, probably because it
hadn't been raised with other

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.792
crows.
Right after the fire I used to

00:16:48.792 --> 00:16:51.968
go and visit.
You see that "I" coming very

00:16:51.968 --> 00:16:54.960
suddenly there.
So, why does it appear?

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.034
Well, this is a moment when
Nathan, as the writer,

00:16:59.034 --> 00:17:03.632
takes an unusual liberty,
makes an unusual claim on us as

00:17:03.632 --> 00:17:08.033
readers, by entering directly
into the first person of this

00:17:08.033 --> 00:17:11.020
character,
violating what has been the

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.650
formal habit of the novel,
up until that moment,

00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:16.190
or the formal habit of that
scene.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:21.986
It happens on a few occasions.
So, he becomes the eye of

00:17:21.986 --> 00:17:25.738
Faunia.
Now, you might say that this is

00:17:25.738 --> 00:17:30.453
just to emphasize the
imaginative work that's required

00:17:30.453 --> 00:17:34.872
for Nathan to tell this story.
But I want to suggest that

00:17:34.872 --> 00:17:37.837
there is a structural
relationship between Nathan and

00:17:37.837 --> 00:17:39.890
Faunia that we have to attend
to,

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.694
and to excavate this I want to
go back to that first dance

00:17:44.694 --> 00:17:48.400
scene, on page 27,
with Coleman and Nathan.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.970
This is when they start to talk
about sex.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:06.365
And this is Nathan's
reflection: "The moment a man

00:18:06.365 --> 00:18:14.665
starts to tell you about sex,
he's telling you something

00:18:14.665 --> 00:18:19.503
about the two of you."
It's quite a remarkable

00:18:19.503 --> 00:18:24.061
statement.
Its homoeroticism should not be

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:28.543
lost on you.
He's telling Nathan about sex

00:18:28.543 --> 00:18:34.146
with Faunia, but how Nathan
hears it, is that it's about him

00:18:34.146 --> 00:18:39.027
and Coleman.Now,
I don't mean to say that it

00:18:39.027 --> 00:18:44.822
literally becomes about the
fantasy of sex between--literal

00:18:44.822 --> 00:18:50.010
sex between--Coleman and Nathan.
But, I will point out a couple

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.488
of things.
One is that Nathan,

00:18:52.488 --> 00:18:56.693
if you recall,
has been rendered impotent by

00:18:56.693 --> 00:19:01.202
his surgery.
So, his only relation,

00:19:01.202 --> 00:19:08.255
in that physical way,
to Coleman, is not really as a

00:19:08.255 --> 00:19:13.633
man as such.
I think he's imagined to be

00:19:13.633 --> 00:19:18.842
unmanned in this scene.
So, then you get,

00:19:18.842 --> 00:19:25.260
on page 43, an even fuller
description of this.

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.945
He's talking,
Coleman is talking,

00:19:31.945 --> 00:19:36.038
again, about Faunia,
and Nathan is very much

00:19:36.038 --> 00:19:40.651
responding in the conversation.
We were enjoying

00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:42.982
ourselves, now,
and I realized that in my

00:19:42.982 --> 00:19:46.537
effort to distract him from his
rampaging pique by arguing for

00:19:46.537 --> 00:19:50.759
the primacy of his pleasure,
I had given a boost to his

00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:54.650
feeling for me,
and I exposed mine for him.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.125
I was gushing and I knew it.
I surprised myself with my

00:19:59.125 --> 00:20:02.559
eagerness to please,
felt myself saying too much,

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:05.184
explaining too much,
over-involved and overexcited

00:20:05.184 --> 00:20:08.613
in the way you are when you're a
kid and you think you've found a

00:20:08.613 --> 00:20:11.880
soul mate in the new boy down
the street and you feel yourself

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.666
drawn by the force of the
courtship and so act as you

00:20:14.666 --> 00:20:17.933
don't normally do and a lot more
openly than you may even want

00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:20.196
to.
But ever since he had banged on

00:20:20.196 --> 00:20:23.176
my door the day after Iris's
death and proposed that I write

00:20:23.176 --> 00:20:26.519
Spooks for him,
I had, without figuring or

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:29.480
planning on it,
fallen in to a serious

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.519
friendship with Coleman
Silk.

00:20:32.519 --> 00:20:37.846
The language of courtship and
of gushing, of that

00:20:37.846 --> 00:20:41.619
overeagerness,
suggests a crush.

00:20:41.619 --> 00:20:46.813
It reinforces the homoerotic
charge of their dance,

00:20:46.813 --> 00:20:52.629
and the way Nathan observes his
virile body as they dance

00:20:52.629 --> 00:20:58.333
together.
And it gives it that emotional

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:02.802
dimension.
So, we're told of Coleman,

00:21:02.802 --> 00:21:09.542
in another spot in this basic
scene, that he's contaminated by

00:21:09.542 --> 00:21:13.865
desire alone.
Nathan, if he is seized by

00:21:13.865 --> 00:21:18.484
Coleman's story,
as we're told at the end of the

00:21:18.484 --> 00:21:22.513
book, is contaminated,
too, by that story,

00:21:22.513 --> 00:21:27.603
and by desire for Coleman.
So, just as that stepping over

00:21:27.603 --> 00:21:32.029
into the first person from free
indirect third-person discourse,

00:21:32.029 --> 00:21:34.816
stepping over in to the "I" of
his character,

00:21:34.816 --> 00:21:37.920
represents crossing a certain
kind of boundary,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:45.936
so does the erotic charge that
is given to his relationship

00:21:45.936 --> 00:21:50.054
with Coleman.
Now, there are a couple

00:21:50.054 --> 00:21:53.839
ways of thinking about that
homoerotic structure.

00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:56.723
One is through the work of a
critic named Eve Sedgwick,

00:21:56.723 --> 00:21:59.980
and if you've taken any women's
and gender studies courses,

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.926
or studied feminist
interpretations or queer

00:22:02.926 --> 00:22:07.089
interpretations of literature,
she should be a familiar name.

00:22:07.089 --> 00:22:09.916
She wrote a famous book called
Between Men, and

00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:12.431
her argument is that,
in a lot of--I think her

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:15.473
subject was Victorian
fiction--in a lot of Victorian

00:22:15.473 --> 00:22:18.354
fiction,
the homoerotic or the

00:22:18.354 --> 00:22:24.500
homosocial bond between men is
channeled through a woman,

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.500
and the perfect example of
that, in this novel,

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.283
is when Coleman and Nathan go
to the dairy farm to watch

00:22:33.283 --> 00:22:35.460
Faunia.
So, it's as if,

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.527
by both watching Faunia
together, through her their

00:22:39.527 --> 00:22:42.700
desire for one another is
channeled.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.410
So, they're able to experience
desire together,

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:51.008
and it's safely not for each
other because Faunia is right

00:22:51.008 --> 00:22:54.799
there as a mediating point of
the triangle.

00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:58.265
But I think we can say some
other things about the

00:22:58.265 --> 00:23:01.589
structure, too,
and not just that it's there.

00:23:01.589 --> 00:23:04.778
Essentially,
Sedgwick's theory allows us to

00:23:04.778 --> 00:23:07.760
see how it works,
to see that it's there.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.779
But then, we want to ask, why?
And this is related to another

00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:13.049
feature of the text that you
might have noticed,

00:23:13.049 --> 00:23:15.683
and that is the repeated
reference to Thomas Mann's

00:23:15.683 --> 00:23:18.010
Death in Venice.
Did you notice that?

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:21.004
It comes back.
Tadzio and Aschenbach are the

00:23:21.004 --> 00:23:24.140
two characters from Mann's
Death in Venice.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.111
This is a
mid-twentieth-century German

00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:28.169
novelist.
This is a small novel,

00:23:28.169 --> 00:23:32.041
a little novella.
It's about an older man named

00:23:32.041 --> 00:23:36.200
Aschenbach who goes to Venice
for a vacation.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:40.611
And he's a scholar and a
writer, and he goes to Venice,

00:23:40.611 --> 00:23:45.512
and he suddenly finds himself
transfixed by a beautiful young

00:23:45.512 --> 00:23:51.247
boy that he sees at the hotel.
And he spends the novel chasing

00:23:51.247 --> 00:23:55.635
Tadzio, the boy,
all around the city and trying

00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:59.521
to get close to him.
And the mother realizes,

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:03.750
the mother of Tadzio realizes
there is this sort of lecherous

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.710
man coming after her boy and
warns him,

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.420
Tadzio, to stay away from
Aschenbach.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:16.951
In the end Aschenbach is taken
with, I think it's tuberculosis

00:24:16.951 --> 00:24:22.197
or some disease--I can't
remember what the disease

00:24:22.197 --> 00:24:27.491
is--and he dies in Venice.
This passion for the boy is

00:24:27.491 --> 00:24:32.269
described, and this is the part
that Roth quotes in this novel,

00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:35.430
as "a late adventure of the
feelings."

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:39.910
So, in those quotations
Roth is directing us to think

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:44.230
about the lateness of that
desire as its characteristic

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.558
quality.
It's an older man suddenly

00:24:48.558 --> 00:24:54.130
waylaid by an unexpected surge
of passion.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.866
Now, what I find interesting
about that is that Roth could

00:24:58.866 --> 00:25:03.602
have chosen any number of
romantic stories to characterize

00:25:03.602 --> 00:25:05.817
this.
Humbert would be one:

00:25:05.817 --> 00:25:09.032
a late adventurer of the
feeling, an older man,

00:25:09.032 --> 00:25:13.555
younger woman.
Why does he take a homoerotic

00:25:13.555 --> 00:25:17.781
structure?
Why does he choose this story,

00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:23.012
a story of same-sex desire,
rather than a heterosexual

00:25:23.012 --> 00:25:27.136
desire?
Why is this the model that he

00:25:27.136 --> 00:25:30.711
chooses?
So, I would suggest it's

00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:35.589
important that the novel is
called Death in

00:25:35.589 --> 00:25:40.250
Venice, that
Aschenbach dies.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:45.195
There is something about
homoerotic desire--and this is a

00:25:45.195 --> 00:25:49.610
characteristic of fiction that
features it over the

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:56.130
centuries--that it seems deadly.
Somehow it's deadly.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:02.228
It's imagined as being deadly.
Of course, this is a product of

00:26:02.228 --> 00:26:06.888
its unconventionality in older
times, the fear that a

00:26:06.888 --> 00:26:11.168
heterosexual person,
or a person who conceives

00:26:11.168 --> 00:26:16.048
themselves as heterosexual,
might experience if they are

00:26:16.048 --> 00:26:20.758
taken by a homoerotic urge.
So, there's somehow that

00:26:20.758 --> 00:26:24.415
death gets wound into stories of
homoerotic desire,

00:26:24.415 --> 00:26:27.779
and The Human Stain is
no different.

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:35.010
I just want to point out a
couple of examples.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:43.122
You can see it in the
difference between the way

00:26:43.122 --> 00:26:48.059
Nathan describes his decision to
dance with Coleman and the way

00:26:48.059 --> 00:26:52.700
Faunia describes hers.
This is Faunia on 226.

00:27:10.339 --> 00:27:14.259
This is just right in the
middle of the page.

00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:17.868
She's playing with her
hair and thinking that her hair

00:27:17.868 --> 00:27:20.527
is like seaweed,
a great trickling sweep of

00:27:20.527 --> 00:27:24.180
seaweed saturated with brine,
and what's it cost her anyway?

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.190
What's the big deal?
Plunge in, pour forth.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.030
If this is what he wants,
abduct the man and snare him.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.486
It won't be the first one.
That's Faunia,

00:27:33.486 --> 00:27:35.080
sort of thinking,
why not?

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.750
Why not dance as he's asking me?
Why not?

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:43.230
What's the big deal?
What does it cost her?

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:47.292
Contrast that with,
on 25 and 26,

00:27:47.292 --> 00:27:51.160
the way Nathan thinks.
"What the hell?"

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.849
I thought, "We'll both be dead
soon enough."

00:27:53.849 --> 00:27:57.684
And so, I got up and there on
the porch, Coleman Silk and I

00:27:57.684 --> 00:28:00.660
began to dance the fox trot
together.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:04.465
And, if you look on 26,
you get another description

00:28:04.465 --> 00:28:07.509
where death comes back up as a
reason.

00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:13.473
Maybe why it didn't even
cross my mind to laugh and let

00:28:13.473 --> 00:28:17.592
him, if he wanted to,
dance around the porch by

00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:21.329
himself, just laugh and enjoy
myself watching him,

00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:24.759
maybe why I gave him my hand
and let him place his arm around

00:28:24.759 --> 00:28:28.359
my back and push me dreamily
around that old bluestone floor,

00:28:28.359 --> 00:28:31.676
was because I had been there
that day when her corpse was

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:33.571
still warm--[that's Iris'
corpse]

00:28:33.571 --> 00:28:36.000
and seen what he'd looked
like.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.130
The corpse pops up in the
middle of this reflection on why

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:45.447
he's dancing.
So, two times in the space of a

00:28:45.447 --> 00:28:51.190
page, death accompanies his
decision to dance with Coleman.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:57.434
So, why then is homoerotic
desire such a threat,

00:28:57.434 --> 00:29:02.469
a threat in this way?
Well, one structural reason

00:29:02.469 --> 00:29:07.087
could be that homoerotic desire
threatens to collapse the engine

00:29:07.087 --> 00:29:11.802
of desire, which is difference.
The novel has set up difference

00:29:11.802 --> 00:29:16.706
being the engine of desire.
So, if it's desire for the

00:29:16.706 --> 00:29:22.834
same--understood as gender,
the important sameness being

00:29:22.834 --> 00:29:28.849
gender--then it looks like a
self-canceling desire,

00:29:28.849 --> 00:29:31.590
a desire that can't sustain
itself, somehow,

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.540
or that lacks that fundamental
structure of difference that the

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.953
whole novel seeks to set up.
If desire is the engine of the

00:29:39.953 --> 00:29:43.910
sentence, as well as the engine
of the narrative,

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:49.223
as well as the engine of human
connection in the novel,

00:29:49.223 --> 00:29:55.379
its collapse is a great threat,
not just to human connection,

00:29:55.379 --> 00:29:58.490
to human life,
but to writing.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.985
So, this is one way to
understand the problem,

00:30:02.985 --> 00:30:07.939
and it goes back to speak to my
point about inhabiting,

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:12.160
or being a parasite upon,
Coleman's story.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.043
Nathan inhabits the "I," and
finally begins to conflate

00:30:17.043 --> 00:30:21.202
himself with Coleman,
or with Coleman's lovers,

00:30:21.202 --> 00:30:24.819
and we get various versions of
this.

00:30:24.819 --> 00:30:36.173
So, while Faunia and Coleman
dance, he replaces--let's

00:30:36.173 --> 00:30:42.069
see--he replaces Les.
So, while they're dancing in

00:30:42.069 --> 00:30:43.490
the cottage--Do you remember
this scene?

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:49.301
I can't find my page number in
my notes right now -- while they

00:30:49.301 --> 00:30:55.112
are dancing in Coleman's house
privately--this is after Coleman

00:30:55.112 --> 00:31:00.174
stops seeing Nathan--he's
outside in his car lurking on

00:31:00.174 --> 00:31:03.938
the road.
The only other person who does

00:31:03.938 --> 00:31:07.942
that is Les Farley.
So, he comes to be in the

00:31:07.942 --> 00:31:11.250
position of Faunia's other
lover.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:13.006
Okay.
So, that's one way he enters

00:31:13.006 --> 00:31:15.295
into his characters,
as he starts to occupy,

00:31:15.295 --> 00:31:18.526
structurally,
the same spot as they do,

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:22.619
but it actually gets much more
complicated.

00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:29.551
This is on 326,
in Ernestine's conversation,

00:31:29.551 --> 00:31:36.869
in her scene.
She is very helpful to say: 

00:31:36.869 --> 00:31:39.764
"Well,
then" [because Nathan has said,

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:42.456
"I've been trying to figure out
Coleman"]

00:31:42.456 --> 00:31:44.303
"Well,
then," she says,

00:31:44.303 --> 00:31:48.630
"you are now an honorary member
of the Silk family."

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.824
So, there he is,
taken right into the Silk

00:31:51.824 --> 00:31:56.809
family, so he starts to replace
Coleman after Coleman's death.

00:31:56.809 --> 00:32:02.008
At the very end,
as he's getting into the car to

00:32:02.008 --> 00:32:07.869
drive down to New Jersey for
dinner with the Silks,

00:32:07.869 --> 00:32:13.597
he says--let's see--"Like
Steena Paulsson before me," he

00:32:13.597 --> 00:32:20.053
was going to sit with his East
Orange family as the white guest

00:32:20.053 --> 00:32:24.629
at Sunday dinner.
He becomes Steena in that

00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:27.397
passage.
He becomes Faunia when he

00:32:27.397 --> 00:32:32.732
dances with Coleman.
He leeches into all the aspects

00:32:32.732 --> 00:32:37.143
of Coleman's life.
So, it's not just inhabiting

00:32:37.143 --> 00:32:40.480
imaginatively,
but there are these structural

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.879
ways that he comes to double
Coleman and also to double his

00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:45.790
lovers.

00:32:52.329 --> 00:32:59.083
It's by virtue of a blankness
that Nathan sees in Coleman and

00:32:59.083 --> 00:33:03.359
in Faunia that he can pull this
off,

00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:07.666
and this is very noticeable in
my favorite scene of the novel,

00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:10.730
the Tanglewood scene,
which I think is quite

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.870
beautiful.
This is on 209,210.

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:25.214
He's writing about music,
here, and the feeling that all

00:33:25.214 --> 00:33:31.160
the people in the audience were
going to be swept away by death.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.269
That's sort of the overwhelming
sense of mortality in the

00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:36.657
beginning of the,
in the middle of the page,

00:33:36.657 --> 00:33:39.900
there, and he says:
And yet what a lovely day

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.660
it is today, a gift of a day,
a perfect day lacking nothing,

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:47.314
in a Massachusetts vacation
spot that is itself as harmless

00:33:47.314 --> 00:33:49.519
and pretty as any on
earth.

00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:53.781
I would suggest that it's
precisely that "lacking nothing"

00:33:53.781 --> 00:33:57.520
that makes it deathly,
because if you lack nothing,

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:01.704
there is no desire.
So, it's the very stasis of the

00:34:01.704 --> 00:34:06.394
day and the solidity of that
music that brings him into this

00:34:06.394 --> 00:34:08.992
mood.
And then Bronfman appears,

00:34:08.992 --> 00:34:11.860
the pianist,
and you get this wonderful

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:16.698
description of what he does,
how he attacks the piano and

00:34:16.698 --> 00:34:21.250
banishes death with his
contention with the piano.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:26.218
And it should remind you of all
that's said about life being an

00:34:26.218 --> 00:34:28.773
argument.
Remember, I mentioned last time

00:34:28.773 --> 00:34:32.230
Coleman saying that all Western
literature begins with a fight,

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.336
with an argument between
Achilles and Agamemnon,

00:34:35.336 --> 00:34:37.650
Coleman's fight with the
college,

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:44.057
Coleman's fight against the
racial contract drawn up for him

00:34:44.057 --> 00:34:50.573
at birth, Nathan's contention in
the world of desire which he

00:34:50.573 --> 00:34:55.892
then withdraws from.
He implants in his own

00:34:55.892 --> 00:35:01.630
narrative of his thoughts what
Coleman will later say.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:04.275
This is on 211.
Coleman says,

00:35:04.275 --> 00:35:08.114
"I was telling Faunia that he
took ten years at least out of

00:35:08.114 --> 00:35:11.265
that piano."
Nathan had said on the previous

00:35:11.265 --> 00:35:15.124
page that they "would have to
throw that thing out after

00:35:15.124 --> 00:35:20.782
Bronfman's finished with it."
He plants in the narrative the

00:35:20.782 --> 00:35:24.992
shared thought,
asserting that somehow

00:35:24.992 --> 00:35:29.769
Coleman's mind is
Nathan's mind;

00:35:29.769 --> 00:35:33.769
that collapse is written right
into the realist assumption of

00:35:33.769 --> 00:35:35.327
the novel.
We, sort of,

00:35:35.327 --> 00:35:37.980
read along in those passages
thinking, "oh,

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.706
let's take this at face value,
oh, yes, they're thinking the

00:35:41.706 --> 00:35:43.867
same thing."
But, of course,

00:35:43.867 --> 00:35:48.099
it's Nathan who plants that;
it's Nathan who's making it up.

00:35:48.099 --> 00:35:51.389
We don't know how honest Nathan
is.

00:35:51.389 --> 00:35:55.420
So, he claims to have the same
thoughts.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.062
It's the blankness.
He describes--Nathan--Faunia

00:36:04.062 --> 00:36:10.313
and Coleman as a pair of blanks,
and it's precisely that

00:36:10.313 --> 00:36:16.110
blankness that allows Nathan to
inhabit Coleman.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:19.678
This is,
in fact, a quality that he

00:36:19.678 --> 00:36:24.843
finally attributes to the,
as he says, "negroes," in the

00:36:24.843 --> 00:36:34.170
photograph of Coleman's family.
And this is on 337,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:44.272
the very bottom of 336.
"They were pale but they were

00:36:44.272 --> 00:36:46.659
Negroes.
How could you tell they were

00:36:46.659 --> 00:36:49.681
Negroes?
By little more than that they

00:36:49.681 --> 00:36:54.954
had nothing to hide."
This is quite an astonishing

00:36:54.954 --> 00:36:58.214
sentence.
If identity is,

00:36:58.214 --> 00:37:04.924
in its ideal form,
secrecy, if you have nothing to

00:37:04.924 --> 00:37:10.539
hide, then you don't have an
identity.

00:37:10.539 --> 00:37:13.527
There are two things,
two implications that flow from

00:37:13.527 --> 00:37:18.173
that.
One is that racial secrecy is

00:37:18.173 --> 00:37:24.613
really the only kind of secrecy
that matters,

00:37:24.613 --> 00:37:33.539
because being Negro is the only
thing that one would hide.

00:37:33.539 --> 00:37:38.930
It also means that these people
are just as blank as Faunia and

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:39.800
Coleman;

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:49.444
so there is a somewhat
pernicious racial simplification

00:37:49.444 --> 00:37:52.836
going on, here.
It's somewhat related to the

00:37:52.836 --> 00:37:57.114
simplification of thinking that
homoerotics is the desire for

00:37:57.114 --> 00:38:00.143
the same.
What both of these logics leave

00:38:00.143 --> 00:38:02.878
out is that point that is
insisted upon,

00:38:02.878 --> 00:38:05.312
actually,
earlier in the novel,

00:38:05.312 --> 00:38:09.633
which is that the other fellow
always has a life you can't

00:38:09.633 --> 00:38:13.001
know,
that it's simply the otherness

00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:18.618
of any individual person that
keeps you from knowing more than

00:38:18.618 --> 00:38:22.793
you can see on the surface.
It's the otherness,

00:38:22.793 --> 00:38:25.545
not the racial otherness,
necessarily,

00:38:25.545 --> 00:38:30.058
but just the otherness.
So, in these last pages,

00:38:30.058 --> 00:38:34.940
otherness gets collapsed back
into racial otherness,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.572
and I think perhaps this is why
Ernestine emerges as a

00:38:39.572 --> 00:38:44.999
stereotyped character.
He is folding an analysis of

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:51.063
identity back into racial
stereotype, an analysis of

00:38:51.063 --> 00:38:57.489
identity as blank.
They have no interiority.

00:38:57.489 --> 00:39:02.986
One question that you could ask
is whether this constitutes a

00:39:02.986 --> 00:39:08.538
critique of Nathan.
Is Nathan being brought to task

00:39:08.538 --> 00:39:13.219
for stealing the story of
Coleman Silk?

00:39:13.219 --> 00:39:16.831
Is this making passing,
racial passing,

00:39:16.831 --> 00:39:22.248
into the ultimate form of
identity, that to be interesting

00:39:22.248 --> 00:39:26.430
as a character you've got to be
passing?

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:33.900
Is it indicting Nathan?
Is it suggesting that Nathan

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:38.241
really does desire Coleman?
These are all kinds of

00:39:38.241 --> 00:39:40.469
questions that you can think
about.

00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:44.540
One thing, I think,
it does do, though,

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:48.611
is highlight the
constructedness of the

00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:54.140
narrative, across the board.
Coleman says about his

00:39:54.140 --> 00:40:00.156
Spooks narrative that he
could not do the creative remove

00:40:00.156 --> 00:40:04.739
that the pros do because the
creative remove,

00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:07.539
he says, "It's still the raw
thing."

00:40:07.539 --> 00:40:10.850
It's a bad book because it's
still the raw thing.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:17.387
He has no self-distancing.
So, what the critique of

00:40:17.387 --> 00:40:20.965
Nathan does, the implicit
critique of Nathan,

00:40:20.965 --> 00:40:24.869
does is distance us from him,
to some degree.

00:40:24.869 --> 00:40:28.810
It allows us to see him as an
unreliable narrator.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:39.191
It also, I think,
models Roth's own relation to

00:40:39.191 --> 00:40:44.068
Nathan Zuckerman.
Nathan Zuckerman is the

00:40:44.068 --> 00:40:47.685
creative remove,
is the medium of the creative

00:40:47.685 --> 00:40:52.266
remove, that Roth requires in
order to write about his own

00:40:52.266 --> 00:40:55.359
life.
Most of the Nathan Zuckerman

00:40:55.359 --> 00:41:00.100
novels draw very heavily on
Roth's life, and in fact at one

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.352
point Roth writes an
autobiographical nonfiction book

00:41:04.352 --> 00:41:08.440
called The Facts.
And it's all,

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:12.175
mostly, about complaining,
about the response to

00:41:12.175 --> 00:41:16.579
Portnoy's Complaint,
 and also caviling

00:41:16.579 --> 00:41:20.612
against his ex-wife,
a very happy habit that Roth

00:41:20.612 --> 00:41:23.913
has.
At the end of The Facts

00:41:23.913 --> 00:41:30.072
there is a letter to Roth
from Nathan Zuckerman where he

00:41:30.072 --> 00:41:34.570
says, "You idiot.
Why are you doing autobiography?

00:41:34.570 --> 00:41:37.650
This is not your style.
Facts: it's just not your thing.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:39.860
Forget it.
It's terrible.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.486
Don't publish this.
Go back to what you do best,

00:41:43.486 --> 00:41:47.648
which is making stuff up."
Roth has played with this

00:41:47.648 --> 00:41:51.778
dynamic between autobiography
and fiction throughout his

00:41:51.778 --> 00:41:54.752
career.
And I think the threat,

00:41:54.752 --> 00:41:59.487
the deathly threat,
of the collapse that's figured

00:41:59.487 --> 00:42:05.189
in the homoerotic element of
this novel is the threat of--it

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:10.697
sort of doubles the threat
of--Roth collapsing into Nathan

00:42:10.697 --> 00:42:12.340
Zuckerman.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.685
And, in another sense,
it doubles the threat of

00:42:19.685 --> 00:42:22.200
writing really only about men,

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.789
that what's weak about the
novel is the way that it

00:42:29.789 --> 00:42:34.159
inhabits the subjectivities of
women especially.

00:42:34.159 --> 00:42:38.598
Delphine Roux is just a
caricature, really,

00:42:38.598 --> 00:42:43.354
and in many small ways Faunia
is a caricature,

00:42:43.354 --> 00:42:47.150
too.
I've talked about Ernestine.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:55.368
Les can be seen as a caricature.
So, it's not something

00:42:55.368 --> 00:42:59.070
exclusive to his female
characters, but it does suggest,

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.426
as I mentioned a little while
back in the lecture,

00:43:02.426 --> 00:43:05.440
a certain kind of limit to
Roth's project.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:10.619
So, I will finish by saying
Roth is an extremely important

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:15.883
writer in this period because of
the very complexity with which

00:43:15.883 --> 00:43:20.808
he makes the texture of his
novels speak to the question of

00:43:20.808 --> 00:43:26.009
fiction's relationship to life,
writing's relation to life,

00:43:26.009 --> 00:43:30.357
and the relationship between
the writer and what he or she

00:43:30.357 --> 00:43:33.510
writes,
the writer and the work.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:38.199
These are questions that vex
writers in this period.

00:43:38.199 --> 00:43:43.735
We have seen many writers in
this syllabus who worry about

00:43:43.735 --> 00:43:46.551
these things:
Barth, Morrison,

00:43:46.551 --> 00:43:50.630
so many of them,
Maxine Hong Kingston.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:54.780
Roth does it in a way that
nobody else particularly does.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.627
He's also widely admired.
When The New York Times

00:43:58.627 --> 00:44:02.943
had this feature a few years
ago--I think it was 2004--on the

00:44:02.943 --> 00:44:06.179
best novels of the last
twenty-five years,

00:44:06.179 --> 00:44:09.663
and they polled about 125
public intellectuals,

00:44:09.663 --> 00:44:12.389
writers, professors of
literature,

00:44:12.389 --> 00:44:16.110
reviewers, and asked what is
the one best novel.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.162
They asked--they made it hard.
They said, "What's the one best

00:44:19.162 --> 00:44:20.760
novel of the last twenty-five
years?"

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.281
Well, number one was
Beloved, number two was

00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:29.711
Blood Meridian,
but if you added up all the

00:44:29.711 --> 00:44:33.600
Roth novels together that people
chose,

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:38.068
Roth was the winner.
So, he's highly regarded,

00:44:38.068 --> 00:44:41.505
although there is split
opinion, as you can see,

00:44:41.505 --> 00:44:45.820
there, about which of his
novels is really the best one.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:49.330
So, I will say to you that
we're tracking,

00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:52.997
in what we're reading,
writers who are making an

00:44:52.997 --> 00:44:57.991
enormous impact on what American
fiction looks like in the latter

00:44:57.991 --> 00:45:02.641
part of the twentieth century.
It's very interesting to me to

00:45:02.641 --> 00:45:05.954
see the very ambivalences that
are at the heart of this

00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:09.869
fiction.
Now, I'll stop there for Roth.

00:45:09.869 --> 00:45:12.868
Let me just say,
as we go into Edward P.

00:45:12.868 --> 00:45:16.866
Jones, the novel that I don't
have on the syllabus is

00:45:16.866 --> 00:45:20.159
Beloved.
It's always a novel that I

00:45:20.159 --> 00:45:23.514
hope that you've read.
I used to teach it routinely,

00:45:23.514 --> 00:45:27.061
but it's fun to shake it up and
put some different things on,

00:45:27.061 --> 00:45:29.840
knowing that a lot of you will
have read it.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.982
When you read Edward P.
Jones, if you have read

00:45:32.982 --> 00:45:36.193
Beloved I'd like you
think hard about the

00:45:36.193 --> 00:45:40.429
relationship between those two
writers and the two novels.

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:42.722
If you haven't read Beloved,
I urge you:

00:45:42.722 --> 00:45:45.164
just go to Wikipedia,
and just get a plot summary,

00:45:45.164 --> 00:45:46.710
or open it up,
even better.

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.953
I won't ask you to read it on
the side, extra,

00:45:48.953 --> 00:45:52.616
although I would love to.
Find out a little bit about it,

00:45:52.616 --> 00:45:57.100
just so that you have it in
your head as you begin to read.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.233
Okay. Thank you.

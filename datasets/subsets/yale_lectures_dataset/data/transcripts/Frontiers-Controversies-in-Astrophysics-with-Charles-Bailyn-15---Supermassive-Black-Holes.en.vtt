00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.928
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:06.284
this is the last class of the
section on black holes and

00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:08.079
relativity.
I should say,

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:12.273
this particular section of the
course has gone in a direction I

00:00:12.273 --> 00:00:15.744
didn't quite expect.
We've done a little more--gone

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:18.170
a little more deeply into the
theory.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.240
We haven't done quite as much
on actual observed objects.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.280
That's not such a terrible
thing.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.707
I'm quite happy with that.
I just want to point out a

00:00:28.707 --> 00:00:31.933
couple of things that were on
the syllabus that we didn't get

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.460
to, because they're very
interesting things.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.117
You can look them up on the
little black hole website and

00:00:37.117 --> 00:00:39.110
find out all sorts of things
about them.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.044
And one of them is,
there exists a category of

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:48.540
what's called supermassive black
holes.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.466
I mentioned the black holes
that come from stars,

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:57.880
and I'll talk about that much
more today.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.527
But I don't think I'm going to
have a chance to talk about the

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:03.971
supermassive black holes.
These are black holes that live

00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:08.367
in the centers of galaxies and
can have masses of hundreds of

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.738
thousands, millions,
sometimes even billions of

00:01:11.738 --> 00:01:18.076
times the mass of the Sun.
So, very massive black holes in

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:23.454
the centers of
galaxies--including our own

00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:26.340
galaxy, by the way.

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:37.111
And it is gas falling into
these black holes that powers

00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:40.500
the quasars.
We saw a gravitationally lensed

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.262
quasar the other day.
These are very powerful sources

00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:48.790
of emission that are located in
the centers of galaxies,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.316
sometimes called active
galactic nuclei,

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:54.879
and they're caused by these
very massive black holes.

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.959
So, that's one thing we're
probably not going to get to.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.128
Another thing is,
I had originally intended to

00:02:01.128 --> 00:02:05.390
talk a little bit about
gravitational waves.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.664
I mentioned that in the context
of the fact that the emission of

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:15.352
these waves causes the orbital
periods of things like the

00:02:15.352 --> 00:02:18.546
binary pulsar,
and indeed all orbits,

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:21.919
in principle,
to gradually becomes shorter.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.835
The orbital period,
the semi-major axis,

00:02:23.835 --> 00:02:26.766
gradually becomes shorter.
But there's also the hope--it

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:29.665
hasn't yet been done--that you
could detect these waves

00:02:29.665 --> 00:02:31.506
directly,
that you could make a kind of

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:33.940
telescope that would actually
observe gravitational waves.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.539
This is now in progress.
It hasn't yet succeeded.

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:41.843
So, these can,
in principle,

00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:49.823
be directly detected.
That hasn't been done yet,

00:02:49.823 --> 00:02:54.800
but it will be soon,
I think.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:05.675
There's something called the
Laser Interferometer Gravity

00:03:05.675 --> 00:03:13.642
Observatory, abbreviated LIGO,
which is basically a

00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:18.462
kilometer-long hunk of metal,
the length of which can be

00:03:18.462 --> 00:03:23.020
measured to some fraction of the
size of an atom.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.477
And when a gravitational wave
rolls over this,

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:28.755
what you expect to happen is
you should see the thing getting

00:03:28.755 --> 00:03:31.868
slightly longer and slightly
shorter as the wave goes over

00:03:31.868 --> 00:03:34.123
it.
The problem with this is that

00:03:34.123 --> 00:03:37.954
the effect of passing trucks on
highways ten miles away is many,

00:03:37.954 --> 00:03:41.481
many times greater than the
effect of passing gravitational

00:03:41.481 --> 00:03:43.606
waves.
And so, what they've done is

00:03:43.606 --> 00:03:46.571
they've built two of these
things, one in Washington State

00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:50.068
and one in Louisiana.
And the plan is to operate them

00:03:50.068 --> 00:03:52.606
simultaneously,
so that you can see,

00:03:52.606 --> 00:03:56.739
things that happen in both
places might be attributable to

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.942
some cosmic source.
There's a whole bunch of other

00:03:59.942 --> 00:04:03.205
stuff to talk about this.
It's a fabulous experiment,

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:06.383
and as I say,
we probably won't get a chance

00:04:06.383 --> 00:04:09.961
to talk about it in detail.
But you can go to the black

00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:12.181
hole website,
and that has links to all sorts

00:04:12.181 --> 00:04:15.007
of other things.
And you may--if they succeed in

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:18.019
this, somebody's winning the
Nobel Prize, and so,

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.197
you may find out about it by
reading it in the paper five

00:04:21.197 --> 00:04:22.560
years from now,
or so.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.349
Yes?
Student: So--I'm

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.839
sorry--you mentioned
supermassive black holes.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:28.069
Have you ever directly observed
them?

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:29.605
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Have we ever

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:31.209
directly observed a supermassive
black hole?

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:33.899
It depends what you mean by
"directly observe."

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.412
By definition,
you can't directly observe a

00:04:36.412 --> 00:04:38.667
black hole.
We infer their presence in

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.077
almost exactly the same way that
we infer the presence of the

00:04:42.077 --> 00:04:44.748
small black holes,
which I'm going to talk about

00:04:44.748 --> 00:04:47.357
now;
namely, by watching things

00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:50.955
orbit around them.
And so, basically what you--for

00:04:50.955 --> 00:04:54.754
example, in the center of our
own galaxy, there's a one--I

00:04:54.754 --> 00:04:57.685
think 1 million,
3 million, I don't remember,

00:04:57.685 --> 00:05:01.417
some number of millions of
solar masses of stuff right at

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:05.391
the center of the galaxy.
You can tell that because the

00:05:05.391 --> 00:05:09.075
orbits of the stars closest in,
which emits no radiation at

00:05:09.075 --> 00:05:11.703
all.
And so, there's something down

00:05:11.703 --> 00:05:15.269
there that's extremely massive
and totally dark.

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:18.667
And we know that that's true by
watching the orbits of nearby

00:05:18.667 --> 00:05:20.669
stars.
And we can actually carry out

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.089
this same kind of observation in
the centers of other galaxies.

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.738
And as far as we can tell,
there's one of these

00:05:26.738 --> 00:05:30.076
supermassive black holes in the
middle of every significant

00:05:30.076 --> 00:05:32.542
galaxy.
And that's actually been one of

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:36.148
the achievements of this kind of
astronomy over the past dozen

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:38.538
years,
or so--is to demonstrate in

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:42.531
each case, for which we have
enough data, there seems to be

00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:45.560
an extremely massive invisible
something,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.839
down in the middle of these
things.

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:49.296
And there are other reasons to
think that they're actually

00:05:49.296 --> 00:05:51.899
black holes, rather than,
you know, a hundred million

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:54.300
neutron stars,
or something silly like that.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.920
And so, we're pretty much
convinced, by now,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.089
that these things live in the
centers of galaxies,

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.372
and we're quite convinced that
there's one in the middle of our

00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:05.990
own galaxy.
Yes?

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.339
Student: Why are they in
the middle of all the galaxies?

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:08.283
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Why are they in the

00:06:08.283 --> 00:06:10.398
middle of all the galaxies?
This is actually a little bit

00:06:10.398 --> 00:06:13.285
of a mystery.
How these things get made is

00:06:13.285 --> 00:06:16.390
not clear.
It's pretty clear how the

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.750
stellar mass,
the ten solar mass ones,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.488
get made.
It's the collapse of a single

00:06:22.488 --> 00:06:24.373
star.
How these things build up,

00:06:24.373 --> 00:06:26.808
how they grow,
where they came from in the

00:06:26.808 --> 00:06:30.430
first place, is a little less
clear than it is for the stellar

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.230
mass thing.
There is recent work which

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.287
suggests that the very first
generation of stars was quite

00:06:37.287 --> 00:06:39.866
massive,
thousands of solar masses,

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:44.079
rather than stars of one solar
mass, or something like that.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:47.497
And maybe this first generation
of stars collapsed down into

00:06:47.497 --> 00:06:50.663
thousand mass black holes,
and then a whole bunch of them

00:06:50.663 --> 00:06:53.699
ran into each other and fell
into the centers of galaxies.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:57.612
But I would have to say that it
isn't entirely clear where these

00:06:57.612 --> 00:07:01.769
supermassive things come from.
In contrast to the situation

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:05.490
with ten solar mass black holes,
where we have,

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:11.303
if not a detailed theory,
at least, a good handle on the

00:07:11.303 --> 00:07:15.320
broad story of where they come
from.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.894
Okay.
So, that's what we're not going

00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:21.110
to talk about.
So, now, let me talk about what

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.520
we are going to talk about.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.614
Sort of a meta-lecture, I guess.
Let's see, last time I talked

00:07:32.614 --> 00:07:37.170
about the Binary Pulsar.
And that was an example of a

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:40.879
very detailed test of
post-Newtonian relativity.

00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:45.240
And what I want to talk about
now is strong-field relativity.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.807
Relativistic effects that have
nothing to do with Newtonian

00:07:50.807 --> 00:07:54.360
theory, that are totally
different,

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.280
and then, happen when you're
really, very close to an event

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.930
horizon, or in some other kind
of drastic situation.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.212
So, here's the plan,
here's how you would--how would

00:08:05.212 --> 00:08:08.494
you go about testing the
predictions of strong-field

00:08:08.494 --> 00:08:11.867
relativity?
Well, the first thing you'd

00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:16.739
want to do is find a black hole.
Not just talk about them but,

00:08:16.739 --> 00:08:20.930
you know, be able to point in
the sky to where one of them is.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:26.867
And then, you'd like to study
it and find out whether this

00:08:26.867 --> 00:08:32.909
thing you think is a black hole
actually behaves as general

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:37.909
relativity would predict for
such an object.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:40.534
And, in particular,
there's this very strong

00:08:40.534 --> 00:08:44.197
prediction from relativity that
such a thing would not have a

00:08:44.197 --> 00:08:49.497
surface.
That it would have an event

00:08:49.497 --> 00:08:59.986
horizon down which things would
disappear--not a surface of any

00:08:59.986 --> 00:09:04.292
kind.
And so, what I want to talk

00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:08.230
about today is both of these
steps.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:13.864
And, the story starts in the
late 1960s, in the middle of the

00:09:13.864 --> 00:09:19.217
1960s, when the first x-ray--
astronomical observations of

00:09:19.217 --> 00:09:22.760
x-rays were made.
So, it starts with x-ray

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.074
astronomy.
One of the features of

00:09:25.074 --> 00:09:27.610
astronomy for the past
half-century,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.639
or so, is that,
you know,

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:32.467
by the 1950s,
there had been a lot of

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:36.551
astronomy, but it had all been
done in optical light,

00:09:36.551 --> 00:09:40.812
with optical telescopes.
And the story of astronomy for

00:09:40.812 --> 00:09:44.663
the past fifty years has
basically been one after another

00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:48.169
of different kinds of
electromagnetic radiation,

00:09:48.169 --> 00:09:51.502
not optic--other than optical
light, have gradually been

00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:53.651
opened up.
The first of these was radio

00:09:53.651 --> 00:09:55.309
astronomy.
And so, all of a sudden,

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:57.965
people point radio telescopes
at the sky, and they find out

00:09:57.965 --> 00:09:59.659
all sorts of things--one of
which,

00:09:59.659 --> 00:10:00.751
for example,
was pulsars,

00:10:00.751 --> 00:10:02.480
which we talked about the last
time.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.272
The next part of the
electromagnetic spectrum that

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:09.429
was opened was x-rays.
Now, there's a problem with

00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:12.124
doing x-ray observations,
which is that x-rays don't make

00:10:12.124 --> 00:10:14.786
it through the atmosphere.
The atmosphere is completely

00:10:14.786 --> 00:10:16.970
opaque to x-rays.
This is a good thing.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.667
The Sun emits x-rays,
and you would not want to be in

00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:24.862
a place in which you didn't have
an atmosphere to absorb the

00:10:24.862 --> 00:10:28.552
x-rays on the way to yourself.
You'd get skin cancer

00:10:28.552 --> 00:10:31.103
immediately.
And so, the fact that the

00:10:31.103 --> 00:10:34.419
atmosphere absorbs x-rays is
good for everybody,

00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:36.960
except for the x-ray
astronomers,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.034
because it makes it difficult
to do these kinds of

00:10:39.034 --> 00:10:41.673
observations.
So, this only got started at

00:10:41.673 --> 00:10:45.822
the point where you could put
satellites into orbit outside

00:10:45.822 --> 00:10:48.776
the atmosphere,
and equip them with x-ray

00:10:48.776 --> 00:10:51.309
detectors, basically Geiger
Counters.

00:10:51.309 --> 00:10:54.876
There's a lot of talk these
days about going back to the

00:10:54.876 --> 00:10:57.406
Moon.
And one of the very few

00:10:57.406 --> 00:11:02.641
scientific advantages of a moon
colony is that you could do

00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:06.506
ground-based x-ray astronomy.
And so, you know,

00:11:06.506 --> 00:11:09.264
you picture a hobbyist in his
backyard, you know,

00:11:09.264 --> 00:11:12.080
with a kind of Geiger Counter
in a coffee can,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.312
or something,
going outside and observing

00:11:14.312 --> 00:11:17.582
x-rays from the sky.
And I think that would be a

00:11:17.582 --> 00:11:21.331
great thing--but I digress.
Let's see, x-ray astronomy,

00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:24.170
yes, in the 1960s.
So, they send up Geiger

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.067
Counters on satellites,
and increasingly sophisticated

00:11:28.067 --> 00:11:32.095
x-ray telescopes over the years.
And they discovered something

00:11:32.095 --> 00:11:35.247
that they didn't expect.
Namely--so, this is now in the

00:11:35.247 --> 00:11:39.169
1960s also, around the same time
the pulsars were discovered.

00:11:39.169 --> 00:11:45.934
They also discover very strong
sources of x-rays;

00:11:45.934 --> 00:11:50.485
x-ray sources.
And there's a lot of energy

00:11:50.485 --> 00:11:54.394
coming out of these things,
thousands of times,

00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:59.325
even hundreds of thousands of
times, the radiation that the

00:11:59.325 --> 00:12:00.600
Sun emits.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:10.253
Radiation--and from these x-ray
sources, essentially all of it

00:12:10.253 --> 00:12:12.908
in x-rays.
There's small amounts of

00:12:12.908 --> 00:12:15.322
optical, radio,
other kinds of radiation,

00:12:15.322 --> 00:12:18.220
but basically these are x-ray
emitting stars.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.627
They're stars that emit huge
amounts of x-ray luminosity,

00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:25.023
and not a whole lot else.
And they're very,

00:12:25.023 --> 00:12:30.494
very, very powerful.
And so, people wondered what

00:12:30.494 --> 00:12:32.909
these were.
These were unexpected.

00:12:32.909 --> 00:12:35.870
Nobody had predicted that this
would be there.

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.475
And as they started to think
about what these things might

00:12:38.475 --> 00:12:40.350
be, they realized,
well, what is x-ray?

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.892
An x-ray is a very energetic
photon, very short wavelength

00:12:43.892 --> 00:12:46.087
light;
therefore, each one of the

00:12:46.087 --> 00:12:49.920
photons carries a big punch.
So, these are energetic photons.

00:12:53.149 --> 00:12:57.237
And the more energetic the
radiation that is emitted,

00:12:57.237 --> 00:13:01.282
in sort of general terms,
the hotter the material that

00:13:01.282 --> 00:13:04.577
emits it has to be,
just in order to crank up the

00:13:04.577 --> 00:13:07.706
energy, you need.
That's why ordinary objects at

00:13:07.706 --> 00:13:09.990
room temperature glow in the
infrared.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.349
If you heat them up,
they start at thousands of

00:13:13.349 --> 00:13:15.789
degrees.
Things start to glow in the red.

00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:18.108
You heat them up still further,
you get white light,

00:13:18.108 --> 00:13:19.929
blue light.
If you crank things up to

00:13:19.929 --> 00:13:22.340
hundreds of thousands of
degrees, you start to get

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.788
ultraviolet radiation.
And it turns out,

00:13:24.788 --> 00:13:28.443
in order to get x-rays,
you need to have things that

00:13:28.443 --> 00:13:31.740
have been heated up to millions
of degrees.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:37.534
So, energetic photons would
come from--require high

00:13:37.534 --> 00:13:44.141
temperature, by which I mean,
you know, a million degrees,

00:13:44.141 --> 00:13:46.669
or so.
By contrast,

00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:53.173
the Sun and other similar
stars, has a surface temperature

00:13:53.173 --> 00:13:56.140
of about 6,000 degrees.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:04.145
That's hot enough to glow in
the optical, but not hot enough

00:14:04.145 --> 00:14:07.279
to generate large numbers of
x-rays.

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:12.438
And you can also go further and
say, you can figure out how much

00:14:12.438 --> 00:14:17.434
radiation ought to come from a
given volume of million-degree,

00:14:17.434 --> 00:14:21.705
whatever it is.
And you discover--so,

00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:27.395
combining the temperature and
the luminosity,

00:14:27.395 --> 00:14:34.250
there's a little formula which
I won't write down,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.250
which tells you how big the
thing has to be in order to emit

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.680
that much radiation.
If the Sun were five times

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.590
bigger, it would emit 5^(2) more
radiation.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:49.912
And it turns out that if you
combine this stuff,

00:14:49.912 --> 00:14:55.461
the emitting region is
small--much smaller than an

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:57.500
ordinary star.

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:07.325
There's another argument,
a completely different

00:15:07.325 --> 00:15:10.715
argument, that whatever is
emitting these x-rays has to be

00:15:10.715 --> 00:15:13.350
small,
which is the following:

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:16.809
the brightness of these things
varies.

00:15:16.809 --> 00:15:19.279
So, also, here's a second
argument.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:24.352
Brightness varies,
and it varies quickly,

00:15:24.352 --> 00:15:28.962
hundreds of times a second.
Hundreds--so,

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:33.340
on time scales of 1/100th of a
second, the brightness of these

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:36.570
things can vary by a factor of
2, or more.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.876
Now, that immediately tells you
that the size of the region that

00:15:45.876 --> 00:15:50.445
is emitting the radiation has to
be smaller than 1/100th of a

00:15:50.445 --> 00:15:53.388
light second.
Because, imagine--here's a

00:15:53.388 --> 00:15:56.484
thing that's emitting radiation.
And so, it's got,

00:15:56.484 --> 00:15:59.320
you know, photons coming off in
all directions.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.549
And you're kind of over here
watching the thing.

00:16:01.549 --> 00:16:05.178
If it suddenly changes
brightness, you'll see the

00:16:05.178 --> 00:16:09.789
brightness change from the front
part of the object before you

00:16:09.789 --> 00:16:14.250
see the brightness change from
this part of the object,

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.886
because this part of the object
has less of a distance to travel

00:16:17.886 --> 00:16:20.648
to get to you.
And so, the amount of time it

00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:24.706
takes light to get from one side
of this object to the other is a

00:16:24.706 --> 00:16:28.637
kind of minimum amount of time
that you would expect to be able

00:16:28.637 --> 00:16:31.110
to see a change in the
brightness.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.153
Now, you can ask,
what if just this little piece

00:16:34.153 --> 00:16:37.434
gets brighter?
Well, then, that little piece

00:16:37.434 --> 00:16:41.613
had better be emitting
essentially all of the radiation

00:16:41.613 --> 00:16:45.792
you see when it--all of the
increased brightness of the

00:16:45.792 --> 00:16:48.463
radiation that you see.
And so, then,

00:16:48.463 --> 00:16:50.629
you just apply this same
argument to that little piece.

00:16:50.629 --> 00:17:00.512
And so, the size of this has to
be less than 0.01 of a light

00:17:00.512 --> 00:17:05.422
second.
Now, light is 3 x 10^(8) meters

00:17:05.422 --> 00:17:10.070
per second.
So, the size of these things

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:14.710
has to be less than 3 x 10^(6)
meters.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:19.920
That's less than what?
3,000 kilometers.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.535
This is something that's--so,
all this radiation,

00:17:24.535 --> 00:17:29.630
thousands of times the
radiation that you see from the

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.596
Sun,
all of it in x-rays has to be

00:17:31.596 --> 00:17:33.988
coming from something that's
substantially smaller than the

00:17:33.988 --> 00:17:35.339
Earth.
And, in fact,

00:17:35.339 --> 00:17:39.636
some of these things vary on
time scales even smaller than

00:17:39.636 --> 00:17:41.549
that.
So, lots of energy,

00:17:41.549 --> 00:17:44.154
very small object.
This points you,

00:17:44.154 --> 00:17:48.362
again, towards neutron stars,
because they can pack a

00:17:48.362 --> 00:17:52.490
considerable punch in a
relatively small volume.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:57.855
And as these objects were
studied more and more,

00:17:57.855 --> 00:18:03.220
a picture came up of what they
actually were.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.420
And these are things that are
called x-ray binary stars.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.575
"Binary," meaning a double
star--two stars in orbit around

00:18:11.575 --> 00:18:13.110
one another.
And the idea,

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:16.503
here, is that one of these
stars is a kind of ordinary star

00:18:16.503 --> 00:18:18.843
like the Sun,
got a slightly weird shape,

00:18:18.843 --> 00:18:23.647
which I'll explain in a minute.
So, this is some kind of

00:18:23.647 --> 00:18:28.555
relatively ordinary star.
And the other star in the

00:18:28.555 --> 00:18:33.640
system that it's orbiting around
is, well, the generic term is,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:43.326
"compact object," an example of
which would be a neutron star,

00:18:43.326 --> 00:18:50.221
or potentially a black hole.
And the deal is that these guys

00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:54.209
are orbiting so close to each
other that if you look at the

00:18:54.209 --> 00:18:58.128
gravitational force on an atom
of gas at this point of the

00:18:58.128 --> 00:19:01.635
star-- Oh, I should say,
the reason that the star is

00:19:01.635 --> 00:19:06.380
this weird shape is because of
huge--this is basically a tide.

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:11.241
This pulls one part of the star
towards it and that distorts the

00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:15.204
ordinarily spherical shape.
And so, you get this kind of

00:19:15.204 --> 00:19:17.336
teardrop thing.
And if you analyze the

00:19:17.336 --> 00:19:19.630
gravitational forces on an atom
of gas, here,

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:23.139
it's pulled in two directions.
It's pulled downward by--it's

00:19:23.139 --> 00:19:26.966
pulled towards the ordinary star
by the gravity of the ordinary

00:19:26.966 --> 00:19:29.309
star.
But it's also pulled in the

00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:32.666
other direction by the
gravitational force of this

00:19:32.666 --> 00:19:36.827
other thing, whatever it is.
And at this,

00:19:36.827 --> 00:19:44.469
sort of, teardrop place,
here, this peak here,

00:19:44.469 --> 00:19:53.299
the gravity toward the compact
object is greater.

00:19:53.299 --> 00:19:57.393
And that means that the surface
of this particular point on the

00:19:57.393 --> 00:20:01.023
surface of the ordinary star,
in fact, that material is

00:20:01.023 --> 00:20:04.569
pulled off the star and pulled
onto the compact object.

00:20:04.569 --> 00:20:07.749
It kind of--what happens is,
it kind of goes into orbit and

00:20:07.749 --> 00:20:10.380
it ends up orbiting around the
compact object.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.703
So, you have a gas stream,
and all this stuff ends up in a

00:20:15.703 --> 00:20:20.840
big disk of material,
here, called an accretion disk.

00:20:25.099 --> 00:20:28.522
And so, basically,
the gas goes into orbit around

00:20:28.522 --> 00:20:31.728
the compact object.
Now, you know something about

00:20:31.728 --> 00:20:33.246
orbits.
These are perfectly

00:20:33.246 --> 00:20:35.779
ordinary--each atom has its own
little orbit.

00:20:35.779 --> 00:20:38.011
The orbits are perfectly
ordinary orbits,

00:20:38.011 --> 00:20:41.079
which can be described by the
usual set of equations.

00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:48.293
And one thing you know about
that is that the inner orbits go

00:20:48.293 --> 00:20:52.020
faster than the outer orbits.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.407
And so, if you imagine two
pieces of gas,

00:20:57.407 --> 00:21:00.443
sort of, right next to each
other, one inside the other,

00:21:00.443 --> 00:21:02.430
the inside one has to go
faster.

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.713
And so, they rub against each
other, the different parts of

00:21:05.713 --> 00:21:09.434
the gas.
So, this gas generates

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:15.170
friction, and friction does two
things.

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:17.710
First, it heats the stuff up.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.559
And where does the energy for
that heat come from?

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:30.762
It extracts energy from the
orbit, and that,

00:21:30.762 --> 00:21:37.630
in turn, leads to the gas
spiraling in.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.720
So, the gas in this disk
gradually spirals in.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.066
As it does, it creates a lot
heat, generates a lot of

00:21:45.066 --> 00:21:47.799
radiation.
And what was demonstrated in

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:51.444
the early 1970s is that the
inner parts of such an accretion

00:21:51.444 --> 00:21:54.410
disk can be heated up to
millions of degrees,

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:57.804
which is exactly what you want
to be able to explain the

00:21:57.804 --> 00:22:02.756
x-rays.
So, inner accretion disk goes

00:22:02.756 --> 00:22:10.638
up to millions of degrees,
and that's where all these

00:22:10.638 --> 00:22:14.580
x-rays are coming from.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:28.128
Okay.
So, that's what these x-ray

00:22:28.128 --> 00:22:31.023
sources are supposed,
in principle,

00:22:31.023 --> 00:22:32.858
to be.
And there's,

00:22:32.858 --> 00:22:37.577
by now, a lot of evidence that
this general picture is

00:22:37.577 --> 00:22:40.820
basically true.
Questions?

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.150
Yes?
Student: When I was

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.482
asking you before if we--you
directly observed a supermassive

00:22:45.482 --> 00:22:47.153
black hole that was what I was
referring to,

00:22:47.153 --> 00:22:49.018
would they in turn be
the--these like [Inaudible]

00:22:49.018 --> 00:22:51.350
Professor Charles
Bailyn: The accretion disks?

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.667
Student: Yes.
Professor Charles

00:22:52.667 --> 00:22:53.230
Bailyn: Yes,
absolutely.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.490
These are also observed around
supermassive black holes.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.030
That's where the light from
quasars comes from--from

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.720
accretion disks around the
supermassive black holes.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.535
They have it, too.
Again, the question of where

00:23:03.535 --> 00:23:06.455
that gas comes from is a little
less clear than it is in the

00:23:06.455 --> 00:23:09.829
case of the x-ray binaries.
But yes, this is why.

00:23:09.829 --> 00:23:12.653
So, there's two ways you know
that the supermassive black

00:23:12.653 --> 00:23:15.017
holes exist.
One is from the orbits of stuff

00:23:15.017 --> 00:23:17.957
around them, and the other is
from the emission from the

00:23:17.957 --> 00:23:20.619
accretion disk.
But there isn't always gas.

00:23:20.619 --> 00:23:23.309
The one in the center of our
galaxy, there is no accretion

00:23:23.309 --> 00:23:25.150
disk, and so,
we don't see it at all.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.367
And so, in some cases they're
accreting gas,

00:23:27.367 --> 00:23:29.967
in other cases not.
Presumably, that's also true of

00:23:29.967 --> 00:23:32.756
black holes in binary star
systems – that there are some

00:23:32.756 --> 00:23:35.839
of them that aren't close enough
to their companion to pull mass

00:23:35.839 --> 00:23:39.393
off,
and we don't see them as bright

00:23:39.393 --> 00:23:42.360
x-ray sources.
Student: Does that

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.632
necessarily mean that the
objects nearby aren't stable--I

00:23:45.632 --> 00:23:48.319
mean, are not getting pulled
apart by them?

00:23:48.319 --> 00:23:49.170
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Sorry?

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.538
Student: Does that mean
that the--does that necessarily

00:23:51.538 --> 00:23:53.868
mean the nearby objects are not
getting pulled apart by these

00:23:53.868 --> 00:23:54.959
black holes?
Professor Charles

00:23:54.959 --> 00:23:56.390
Bailyn: The nearby objects
are not getting pulled apart.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:24:00.241
Well, the companion star is
gradually being stripped of all

00:24:00.241 --> 00:24:03.029
its gas by the black hole,
in this case.

00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:06.370
But if it were a little further
away it would be a perfectly

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:08.829
stable orbit.
Other questions, yes?

00:24:08.829 --> 00:24:11.053
Student: Why should the
inside have a higher velocity

00:24:11.053 --> 00:24:12.964
than the outside?
Professor Charles

00:24:12.964 --> 00:24:13.920
Bailyn: Oh.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.070
This is smaller.
That's bigger.

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.789
Yes?
Student: Yeah,

00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:25.016
if your compact object is a
neutron star,

00:24:25.016 --> 00:24:27.799
then could it also be a pulsar?
Professor Charles

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.400
Bailyn: In principle,
it could.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.659
In practice,
it turns out that all that gas

00:24:31.659 --> 00:24:35.047
swirling around does bad things
to the magnetic field and to the

00:24:35.047 --> 00:24:36.886
radio emission.
So, in practice,

00:24:36.886 --> 00:24:39.182
they tend not to be pulsars,
but in principle,

00:24:39.182 --> 00:24:41.013
they could be.
Student: Also,

00:24:41.013 --> 00:24:43.443
is pulsar, by definition,
like, one that's oriented in

00:24:43.443 --> 00:24:46.240
such a way that we can see the
pulsations or is it [Inaudible]

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.937
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Well,

00:24:47.937 --> 00:24:50.460
I mean, it depends on exactly
how you define it.

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:56.461
But a pulsar is something that
emits radio from an off-axis

00:24:56.461 --> 00:24:59.489
magnetic field.
Presumably, if it doesn't

00:24:59.489 --> 00:25:02.028
happen to cross us,
we wouldn't know it's a pulsar,

00:25:02.028 --> 00:25:04.110
but somebody else in the galaxy
might.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.211
Student: Okay.
Professor Charles

00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:10.299
Bailyn: Other questions at
this point?

00:25:10.299 --> 00:25:13.397
All right, so,
having found a bunch of these

00:25:13.397 --> 00:25:15.630
x-ray binaries,
the question is,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:19.519
"Can you tell whether they're
black holes or not?"

00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:23.370
And now, let me remind you that
the mass of a neutron star has

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:26.779
to be less than the three times
the mass of the Sun.

00:25:26.779 --> 00:25:34.320
So, the plan is,
you observe the orbit of the

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:44.260
companion, and determine the
mass of the compact object.

00:25:47.619 --> 00:25:52.795
And there's a derivation you
can do, which I won't show you,

00:25:52.795 --> 00:25:57.619
but again, you can look up on
the black hole website,

00:25:57.619 --> 00:26:01.069
which shows--remember what
we're doing, here.

00:26:01.069 --> 00:26:04.909
Let's observe the radial
velocity of the companion versus

00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:06.759
time--goes up,
goes down.

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:10.491
And you determine two things
from this: the orbital period

00:26:10.491 --> 00:26:14.419
and the amplitude of this sine
curve, which I'm going to call

00:26:14.419 --> 00:26:16.771
K.
And it turns out,

00:26:16.771 --> 00:26:20.480
you can prove the following
relationship.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.797
This is actually easy to prove
but it takes three pages to do

00:26:24.797 --> 00:26:27.819
it, so, I won't go through the
exercise.

00:26:27.819 --> 00:26:34.204
PK^(3) / 2πG is
equal to the mass of the compact

00:26:34.204 --> 00:26:38.632
object--the mass of the thing
you don't see,

00:26:38.632 --> 00:26:43.236
times sin^(3)i.
I'll explain that in a

00:26:43.236 --> 00:26:48.579
second--times 1 plus the mass of
the object that--the ordinary

00:26:48.579 --> 00:26:50.885
star,
divided by the mass of the

00:26:50.885 --> 00:26:53.170
compact object,
and this is squared.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:57.467
So now, why would you do this?
So, this is a little

00:26:57.467 --> 00:26:59.300
calculation.
You start with Kepler's laws.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:01.819
You do three pages of algebra.
You come out with this.

00:27:01.819 --> 00:27:03.690
It's written down on the
classes server.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:06.815
Why would you do--why would you
express it in this particular

00:27:06.815 --> 00:27:08.220
form?
Here's the deal.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:14.756
This is called the mass
function, so-called,

00:27:14.756 --> 00:27:22.509
and can be observed from the
velocity curve only.

00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:25.345
Student: [Inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:27:25.345 --> 00:27:28.060
Bailyn: Yes,
the whole term--this only.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:32.532
That's called the mass function.
And the term on the right,

00:27:32.532 --> 00:27:37.605
here, is very interesting,
because it's the mass of the

00:27:37.605 --> 00:27:41.919
object you don't see.
Mass of the compact object,

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:46.190
times something that is less
than 1, sine of any angle.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:48.308
Oh, I should say,
the i here,

00:27:48.308 --> 00:27:52.000
this is the inclination of the
object to the line of sight,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.070
if it's coming exactly towards
you and away from,

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:58.813
i is 90 degrees.
If it's going around this way,

00:27:58.813 --> 00:28:01.145
it's zero.
That has to be in there because

00:28:01.145 --> 00:28:02.839
you're observing radial
velocity.

00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:04.610
But it doesn't matter what this
is.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:11.063
Sine of anything is 1 or less.
Sine cubed of anything is 1 or

00:28:11.063 --> 00:28:13.923
less.
So, this term up here has to be

00:28:13.923 --> 00:28:17.756
less than 1.
This term on the bottom has to

00:28:17.756 --> 00:28:21.599
be greater than 1.
It's 1 plus something squared.

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:25.347
So, on the bottom,
you have a term that's greater

00:28:25.347 --> 00:28:29.210
than 1.
That means that this quantity,

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:35.213
which you can easily observe,
is less than the mass of the

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:37.110
compact object.

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:44.589
So, if the mass function--you
measure the mass function,

00:28:44.589 --> 00:28:48.609
and it comes out to be greater
than three solar masses,

00:28:48.609 --> 00:28:55.309
then the compact object is also
greater than three solar masses.

00:28:55.309 --> 00:28:58.625
And if that's true,
it has to be a black hole,

00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:02.383
because it has to be smaller,
so small that it could

00:29:02.383 --> 00:29:05.920
otherwise only reasonably be a
neutron star.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.529
And yet it's bigger than the
mass of the neutron star itself.

00:29:12.529 --> 00:29:16.004
There's a moderate technical
problem with making this

00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:20.196
observation.
And the problem is,

00:29:20.196 --> 00:29:29.280
this is hard to observe,
because the accretion disk is

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.937
too bright.
So, the accretion disk

00:29:32.937 --> 00:29:34.080
outshines the star.

00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:45.815
Fortunately,
nature solves that problem for

00:29:45.815 --> 00:29:53.608
us, because many of these
objects have intermittent

00:29:53.608 --> 00:29:57.000
accretion.
So the accretion happens.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.765
You see all these x-rays.
Then the accretion turns off

00:29:59.765 --> 00:30:02.586
for various reasons.
And then, when the accretion's

00:30:02.586 --> 00:30:04.444
off, all you see is the
companion star,

00:30:04.444 --> 00:30:06.448
and so you can--when the
accretion is off,

00:30:06.448 --> 00:30:09.449
you can make this measurement.
So, here's how you go about

00:30:09.449 --> 00:30:10.500
finding a black hole.

00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:18.440
First, suddenly,
there's a new source of x-rays.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.540
The x-rays turn on in one of
these transient systems.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.740
Then, you wait.

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:33.122
Then the x-rays turn off.
This happens after a few

00:30:33.122 --> 00:30:33.940
months, typically.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:40.468
Once the x-rays turn off,
that means the accretion disk

00:30:40.468 --> 00:30:43.163
isn't there anymore,
and you measure the mass

00:30:43.163 --> 00:30:43.960
function.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.553
And then, if that's greater
than three solar masses,

00:30:52.553 --> 00:30:55.035
you win;
namely, you've discovered a

00:30:55.035 --> 00:30:57.919
black hole.
And this is a sequence of

00:30:57.919 --> 00:31:02.589
events that I'm rather fond of.
This is what got me tenure.

00:31:02.589 --> 00:31:08.508
And so, I thought I'd show you
an example of how this works out

00:31:08.508 --> 00:31:13.769
in real life.
Let's see, okay.

00:31:13.769 --> 00:31:16.797
Here is--oh,
let me turn the lights down

00:31:16.797 --> 00:31:18.040
just slightly.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.765
Right, so this is just a,
sort of, artist's conception of

00:31:25.765 --> 00:31:29.260
an x-ray binary.
Here's the companion star.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:31.414
Here's the accretion disk.
Down in the middle,

00:31:31.414 --> 00:31:34.329
there is a compact object so
small you can't see it.

00:31:34.329 --> 00:31:37.438
This red stuff is supposed to
be radio emission coming out of

00:31:37.438 --> 00:31:39.958
the poles.
And you can see the little gas

00:31:39.958 --> 00:31:42.109
stream going from one to
another.

00:31:42.109 --> 00:31:45.579
This is what it looks like when
it's x-ray active.

00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:48.051
When the x-rays turn off,
what happens is,

00:31:48.051 --> 00:31:51.487
the stuff just piles up in the
outer part of the accretion

00:31:51.487 --> 00:31:53.751
disk.
There's not enough friction to

00:31:53.751 --> 00:31:56.506
drive it down in there,
no x-rays, and basically,

00:31:56.506 --> 00:31:58.859
all you can see is the
companion star.

00:31:58.859 --> 00:32:03.700
So, let me now take you back
fifteen years in time.

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:07.171
This is something that crossed
my desk shortly after I came to

00:32:07.171 --> 00:32:10.130
Yale as an assistant professor
in the early 1990s.

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.760
This is an astronomical
telegram.

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.196
That's an old fashioned word.
Now, of course,

00:32:16.196 --> 00:32:19.450
we do it all by email.
And these are a system for

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:24.130
distributing the results of
fast-breaking news in the

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.086
heavens.
You know, if you see a

00:32:26.086 --> 00:32:28.635
supernova or some exciting--or
comet, or something exciting

00:32:28.635 --> 00:32:31.210
going off in the sky,
you can't wait to publish it

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.328
for a year and a half,
because, by then,

00:32:33.328 --> 00:32:36.259
it will be gone,
and no one else will study it.

00:32:36.259 --> 00:32:38.645
So, we have this system for
distributing news of

00:32:38.645 --> 00:32:41.233
fast-breaking events,
so that other people can study

00:32:41.233 --> 00:32:43.098
them.
In this particular case,

00:32:43.098 --> 00:32:46.150
there's a whole bunch of astro
jargon down in here.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.960
The title's the only thing you
have to pay attention to.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:52.579
"X-ray transient in the
constellation of Musca."

00:32:52.579 --> 00:32:55.090
New x-ray source suddenly
appeared in Musca.

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:59.042
These guys found it.
You've probably never heard of

00:32:59.042 --> 00:33:02.400
the constellation of
Musca--Musca the Fly.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.433
Yeah.
There's two reasons you haven't

00:33:04.433 --> 00:33:05.883
heard of it.
One is it's in the southern

00:33:05.883 --> 00:33:07.619
hemisphere.
You can't see it from here.

00:33:07.619 --> 00:33:10.519
But the other reason is it's a
pretty pathetic excuse for a

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:12.321
constellation.
It's one, lousy,

00:33:12.321 --> 00:33:15.220
fourth magnitude star.
That's why they call it the

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.331
Fly, right?
But they had to call that part

00:33:17.331 --> 00:33:19.523
of the sky something,
and it's now my favorite

00:33:19.523 --> 00:33:21.960
constellation because it has
this object in it.

00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.369
Anyway, a bright x-ray source
suddenly turned up in Musca.

00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:29.648
A month or so later,
the x-ray source was still

00:33:29.648 --> 00:33:31.607
bright.
I found myself in this lovely

00:33:31.607 --> 00:33:33.964
spot.
This is an observatory in Chile

00:33:33.964 --> 00:33:38.200
where you can see the southern
hemisphere, among other things.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.496
And the two telescopes pictured
here--this was,

00:33:40.496 --> 00:33:41.694
at the time,
the largest,

00:33:41.694 --> 00:33:44.440
most powerful telescope in the
southern hemisphere.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.063
This is the door,
just to give you a sense of

00:33:47.063 --> 00:33:48.527
scale.
And this thing here,

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:50.651
in the foreground,
which looms large in this

00:33:50.651 --> 00:33:53.170
picture, but is actually much
smaller than that,

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:56.215
I have to tell you,
is one of the more far-flung

00:33:56.215 --> 00:33:59.990
outposts of the Yale Empire.
This is Yale's one-meter

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.166
telescope.
It was built in Bethany,

00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:04.393
Connecticut,
and then in the early 1970s,

00:34:04.393 --> 00:34:06.555
somebody said,
well, Connecticut's a really

00:34:06.555 --> 00:34:09.072
stupid place to have a research
telescope, it snows all the

00:34:09.072 --> 00:34:09.984
time.
And so they,

00:34:09.984 --> 00:34:12.289
kind of, picked it up and took
it down to Chile.

00:34:12.289 --> 00:34:15.197
And so, it's,
by now, only our second best

00:34:15.197 --> 00:34:18.460
research telescope,
and I'm very fond of it.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.886
And so, I found myself
observing at this telescope a

00:34:21.886 --> 00:34:26.119
few months after the discovery
of this x-ray source in Musca.

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:29.186
So, I junked the program I
thought I was going to do and

00:34:29.186 --> 00:34:30.969
looked at that thing,
instead.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:34.303
And what I found was that every
10.5 hours it got a little

00:34:34.303 --> 00:34:37.519
brighter, and then a little
fainter, and a then a little

00:34:37.519 --> 00:34:40.797
brighter.
And this was the--the accretion

00:34:40.797 --> 00:34:43.640
disk was still there,
so presumably,

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.132
this was some effect,
for example,

00:34:46.132 --> 00:34:48.980
of the companion star crossing
in front of the accretion disk,

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.437
or something like that.
And so, I fired off my own

00:34:52.437 --> 00:34:54.840
telegram.
There's two things you need to

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.760
know from this one.
That's me.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:01.000
And the other one is that I
claimed that there was a

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.305
10.5-hour modulation in the
brightness of the source,

00:35:04.305 --> 00:35:06.719
which might be the orbital
period.

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:09.879
That's an interesting thing to
know, because if you know the

00:35:09.879 --> 00:35:12.188
orbital period,
if you know P in the

00:35:12.188 --> 00:35:14.414
mass function,
and you think that this might

00:35:14.414 --> 00:35:17.486
turn out to be a black hole,
you can figure out how big

00:35:17.486 --> 00:35:20.699
K has to be in order for
this to be a black hole.

00:35:20.699 --> 00:35:23.216
And the answer is that if you
were to measure the radial

00:35:23.216 --> 00:35:26.290
velocity of this thing,
the difference between the

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:30.818
maximum and the minimum radial
velocity would be--if that were

00:35:30.818 --> 00:35:33.639
800 kilometers a second or
greater,

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:36.722
then the compact object in this
system would have to be a black

00:35:36.722 --> 00:35:37.607
hole.
Problem was,

00:35:37.607 --> 00:35:39.444
I couldn't make that
measurement, because,

00:35:39.444 --> 00:35:41.146
first of all,
the Yale telescope wasn't

00:35:41.146 --> 00:35:43.331
powerful enough to do it.
Second of all,

00:35:43.331 --> 00:35:46.937
the accretion disk was still
too bright to allow observations

00:35:46.937 --> 00:35:50.125
of the companion.
So, I teamed up with a couple

00:35:50.125 --> 00:35:53.207
people who had done this once
already, before:

00:35:53.207 --> 00:35:56.425
Ron Remillard from MIT,
Jeff McClintock from The

00:35:56.425 --> 00:35:59.450
Smithsonian.
And we applied to get time on

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:01.625
the big telescope.
The big telescope,

00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:03.694
which I showed you,
is from The National

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:06.825
Observatory, and you have to
write a proposal to get time on

00:36:06.825 --> 00:36:09.030
it.
Many people want to get time on

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.160
it.
It's quite competitive.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.213
But we wrote a good proposal.
And so, the following year,

00:36:13.213 --> 00:36:16.345
after the x-rays had turned
off, they gave us three nights

00:36:16.345 --> 00:36:19.586
of telescope time on the big
telescope in order to make this

00:36:19.586 --> 00:36:22.978
radial velocity curve.
So, just to orient you,

00:36:22.978 --> 00:36:26.739
here's Chile.
Here's the capital, Santiago.

00:36:26.739 --> 00:36:28.980
Cerro Tololo's up in the Andes,
here.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:32.541
So, you take this enormous
plane ride and then drive up

00:36:32.541 --> 00:36:35.900
to--drive up into here.
And then, what happened

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.719
was--let's see.
The first night it rained.

00:36:38.719 --> 00:36:40.909
This is kind of an occupational
hazard.

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:43.431
The reason there are all these
telescopes in Chile is because

00:36:43.431 --> 00:36:45.911
it's mountains in the desert,
which is an excellent place to

00:36:45.911 --> 00:36:47.603
put telescopes.
As it turns out,

00:36:47.603 --> 00:36:49.891
even in the desert,
sometimes it's cloudy,

00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:52.977
sometimes it rains.
That was the first night,

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:55.146
so that was out.
The second night--oh,

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:57.090
that was interesting,
there was a hailstorm.

00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.712
I don't know if you've ever
been in a six-story high,

00:37:00.712 --> 00:37:03.219
hollow steel building in the
hail.

00:37:03.219 --> 00:37:05.693
It's a very interesting
experience, but it's not

00:37:05.693 --> 00:37:08.202
productive, scientifically.
And so, you know,

00:37:08.202 --> 00:37:10.744
they give you these little
rooms to sleep in,

00:37:10.744 --> 00:37:14.037
which are light-tight and
sound-tight, because you have to

00:37:14.037 --> 00:37:16.659
sleep in the daytime.
And so, there's this very

00:37:16.659 --> 00:37:18.714
dramatic moment.
You wake up at 4:00 in the

00:37:18.714 --> 00:37:21.352
afternoon and you raise the
shades to see if there are

00:37:21.352 --> 00:37:22.608
clouds.
So, fortunately,

00:37:22.608 --> 00:37:24.929
the third of our three nights,
it was all clear.

00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:27.831
The storm had passed and we
were able, then--and so,

00:37:27.831 --> 00:37:30.392
now, we're sitting somewhere in
this building,

00:37:30.392 --> 00:37:33.010
and we were able to make our
observations.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.926
So, let me show you what we did.
Here is a plot of hours,

00:37:36.926 --> 00:37:40.438
time and hours,
on the night of the 3rd of

00:37:40.438 --> 00:37:43.780
April, 1992, versus radial
velocity.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.780
So, this is going to be a
radial velocity plot.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.349
First thing we observed was
this point, right after sunset.

00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:54.200
And you notice that the object
is coming toward us at 250

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.409
kilometers a second.
That's already very good news.

00:37:57.409 --> 00:38:00.531
Because 250 kilometers a second
is actually a little greater

00:38:00.531 --> 00:38:02.699
than the escape velocity of the
galaxy.

00:38:02.699 --> 00:38:05.957
And so, the only reason
something would have that kind

00:38:05.957 --> 00:38:09.276
of speed is if it was in orbit
around some other nearby

00:38:09.276 --> 00:38:13.210
object--or objects in the galaxy
aren't usually that bright.

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:16.860
So, we made a couple more
observations.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.456
And after the third
observation, it was clear that

00:38:20.456 --> 00:38:24.419
the basic parameters of this
system were, more or less,

00:38:24.419 --> 00:38:27.364
correct.
It had started off coming at us

00:38:27.364 --> 00:38:30.380
at 250 kilometers a second.
A couple hours later,

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.340
it was going away from us at
200 kilometers a second.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.989
So, in a mere two hours,
it had turned itself around

00:38:35.989 --> 00:38:39.470
from coming at us at a high rate
of speed, to going away from us.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.369
So, that's good.
It's in an orbit.

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:43.710
It's in an orbit with a very
short period.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:47.739
And so, that was very
encouraging.

00:38:47.739 --> 00:38:50.730
And then, we collected more
data.

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.179
And by about midnight,
we were feeling pretty pleased

00:38:53.179 --> 00:38:55.110
with ourselves,
because you can see what's

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:57.371
happening.
It's now coming--going away

00:38:57.371 --> 00:39:00.753
from us at 400 kilometers a
second, but clearly it's about

00:39:00.753 --> 00:39:05.339
to turn around and go this way.
If you extrapolate 5 1/4 hours

00:39:05.339 --> 00:39:09.880
before this turnaround,
you'd get a point down here.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.885
That meant it would have been
going from minus 400 to positive

00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:16.329
400.
That's 800 kilometers a second.

00:39:16.329 --> 00:39:19.269
If you believe that,
then this probably is a black

00:39:19.269 --> 00:39:20.570
hole.
So, we're feeling pretty

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.596
pleased with ourselves.
We opened a little bottle of

00:39:23.596 --> 00:39:27.199
the local firewater--awful stuff
called Pisco.

00:39:27.199 --> 00:39:28.969
You're not supposed to do that,
right?

00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:31.370
You're not supposed to operate
heavy machinery.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:36.470
And nature was not kind.
We were punished for this.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:41.387
There was a small earthquake.
Chile's in an earthquake zone,

00:39:41.387 --> 00:39:46.199
and so, this does bad things
for precision-aligned optics.

00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:50.287
So, the next point was a little
skewed for reasons that we never

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:53.259
explained in our paper.
And then, there was a gap

00:39:53.259 --> 00:39:55.957
where, for a little while,
we didn't take any data,

00:39:55.957 --> 00:39:58.710
while we were straightening
ourselves out again.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.074
And then, here's the next point.
And so, now,

00:40:01.074 --> 00:40:04.309
that's encouraging again.
And then, more data was

00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:07.429
collected toward the end of the
night.

00:40:07.429 --> 00:40:11.067
And so, as dawn was beginning
to come up, we were kind of back

00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:13.996
where we started.
The thing was coming towards us

00:40:13.996 --> 00:40:16.971
at 250 kilometers a second.
And we really needed one more

00:40:16.971 --> 00:40:18.927
point down here,
in order to nail the whole

00:40:18.927 --> 00:40:21.030
thing down.
The problem was that the

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:23.869
object, of course,
is now setting in the West.

00:40:23.869 --> 00:40:26.456
You know, the Earth turns,
so objects rise in the East and

00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:28.540
they set in the West.
And if you can picture a

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.622
telescope following an object
down into the West,

00:40:30.622 --> 00:40:32.139
it's sort of pointing like
this.

00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:35.844
The principle optical element
in this telescope is a huge

00:40:35.844 --> 00:40:38.160
mirror, a four-meter wide
mirror.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.038
So, thirteen feet across.
And it's not bolted down,

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:43.182
particularly,
because if you put bolts in the

00:40:43.182 --> 00:40:44.911
mirror,
changes in temperature will

00:40:44.911 --> 00:40:47.624
change the size of the bolts,
and it'll throw the optics out

00:40:47.624 --> 00:40:48.963
of alignment.
So, it's just,

00:40:48.963 --> 00:40:51.159
kind of, sitting there,
and it's tipping this way.

00:40:51.159 --> 00:40:53.447
And eventually it's going to,
you know, fall out,

00:40:53.447 --> 00:40:55.800
fall on the floor.
It is way more than seven

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.768
years' bad luck for an
astronomer to break the primary

00:40:58.768 --> 00:41:02.239
mirror of the largest telescope
in the southern hemisphere.

00:41:02.239 --> 00:41:05.081
And so, they don't let the
astronomers actually move the

00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:07.389
telescope themselves.
That would be far too dangerous.

00:41:07.389 --> 00:41:09.610
They have trained experts to do
this.

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.042
And the trained expert was
saying to us at this point,

00:41:12.042 --> 00:41:14.519
you know, "You've got to stop
observing this object.

00:41:14.519 --> 00:41:16.210
We're beyond the safety
limits," and so forth.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.474
And we said,
as scientists do,

00:41:17.474 --> 00:41:19.960
"No, no, in the interest of
science, we must have one more

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:22.725
point."
This argument went on for a

00:41:22.725 --> 00:41:27.889
while, and they were about to,
kind of, pull the plug on us.

00:41:27.889 --> 00:41:30.116
And then, we said,
"Okay, fine," you know,

00:41:30.116 --> 00:41:32.155
"we understand.
Safety of the telescope is

00:41:32.155 --> 00:41:34.611
paramount."
But during the argument,

00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:37.280
we'd accumulated one more
point.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.683
And so, this is kind of the
clinching case,

00:41:39.683 --> 00:41:42.830
down here, as it's coming
towards us at 400 kilometers a

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:44.518
second.
So, we're very pleased with

00:41:44.518 --> 00:41:46.173
ourselves.
Over breakfast,

00:41:46.173 --> 00:41:50.740
we did the exercise of finding
the best-fit sine curve.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:54.160
Here it is.
And if you work out what the

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:58.250
mass function is--the orbital
period is 10.5 hours--the mass

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.370
function is 3.1 times the mass
of the Sun.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:05.279
So, very good, very good news.
You'll notice this plus or

00:42:05.279 --> 00:42:08.380
minus 0.05.
The data's not all that great.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.099
We've subsequently gotten a lot
more data on this thing.

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:13.250
It does turn out to be about
3.1.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.449
But it's also true
that--remember that that formula

00:42:16.449 --> 00:42:19.191
had this sin i in it.
And we were able,

00:42:19.191 --> 00:42:20.930
by other means,
to determine what the

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.734
inclination is.
And it's now clear that this

00:42:23.734 --> 00:42:28.018
object has a--that this binary
system has a compact object of a

00:42:28.018 --> 00:42:30.920
mass of about seven solar masses
in it.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.360
Very, very nice thing.
We published this paper.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.539
Other people have published
other papers.

00:42:37.539 --> 00:42:40.840
By now--oh, here's our telegram
from the next morning.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:44.045
Again, gobbledygook,
except for the fact that the

00:42:44.045 --> 00:42:47.651
value of the mass function is
3.1, "providing dynamical

00:42:47.651 --> 00:42:50.789
evidence that the primary is a
black hole."

00:42:50.789 --> 00:42:53.016
So, we wanted to publish a
paper, you know,

00:42:53.016 --> 00:42:56.250
entitled, "Black Hole Found in
the Constellation of Musca."

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:58.489
People were a little cautious
about that.

00:42:58.489 --> 00:43:00.914
They said, you know,
you haven't yet proved that

00:43:00.914 --> 00:43:02.719
Einstein's relativity is
correct.

00:43:02.719 --> 00:43:05.128
If Einstein's wrong,
this doesn't necessarily have

00:43:05.128 --> 00:43:07.280
to be a black hole.
We said, come on.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.240
You get to assume that
Einstein's right.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.476
They said, well, maybe not.
So, we get to call these

00:43:12.476 --> 00:43:16.410
things, "dynamically confirmed
black hole candidates."

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:19.554
That's the official word.
And here is the current

00:43:19.554 --> 00:43:23.079
collection of these things,
scaled to the Sun and Mercury.

00:43:23.079 --> 00:43:25.520
The one we were looking at,
it's a very close one.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.260
It's a 10.5-hour orbit.
This thing, much bigger,

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:29.616
thirty-hour [correction:
thirty-day]

00:43:29.616 --> 00:43:31.050
orbit, much bigger companion
star.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:37.495
But all of the black holes in
here are sort of between five

00:43:37.495 --> 00:43:41.940
and fifteen times the mass of
the Sun.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.843
And so, now,
fifteen years later,

00:43:43.843 --> 00:43:46.519
there's a whole collection of
these things.

00:43:46.519 --> 00:43:50.354
There's also a collection of
things that turned out to be

00:43:50.354 --> 00:43:53.257
neutron stars.
So now, you can do an

00:43:53.257 --> 00:43:56.203
experiment.
And you can do experiment in

00:43:56.203 --> 00:43:59.360
general relativity.
Here's the derivation.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.595
I'll skip that for you.
And you can ask yourself

00:44:02.595 --> 00:44:05.140
whether event horizons actually
exist.

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.539
So, here's the experiment.
You have a dozen or so things

00:44:08.539 --> 00:44:11.142
that are neutron stars.
You have another dozen or so

00:44:11.142 --> 00:44:14.940
things that are black holes.
You pour gas onto both of them.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:17.523
And indeed--you know,
that's what the companion stars

00:44:17.523 --> 00:44:19.091
are doing.
That's why they have all these

00:44:19.091 --> 00:44:21.388
x-rays.
What happens if gas falls on a

00:44:21.388 --> 00:44:23.857
neutron star?
It picks up a lot of speed and

00:44:23.857 --> 00:44:26.893
starts going at the speed of
light and it hits right into the

00:44:26.893 --> 00:44:29.117
surface.
And so, when it hits the

00:44:29.117 --> 00:44:32.937
surface, all its kinetic energy,
all its thermal energy,

00:44:32.937 --> 00:44:35.238
has to stop.
The kinetic energy stops,

00:44:35.238 --> 00:44:38.409
and all that energy goes into
the surface of the neutron star,

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:41.525
somehow--what's called a
boundary layer--and has to,

00:44:41.525 --> 00:44:43.420
in some way,
get re-radiated.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.239
It basically heats up the
surface of the neutron star.

00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:48.199
You get x-rays from this
surface layer.

00:44:48.199 --> 00:44:50.869
Gas falling onto a black hole
doesn't do it.

00:44:50.869 --> 00:44:53.159
It falls right through the
event horizon.

00:44:53.159 --> 00:44:56.722
And the kinetic energy and the
thermal energy in that gas just

00:44:56.722 --> 00:45:00.225
contributes to the mass of the
black hole, and it doesn't get

00:45:00.225 --> 00:45:02.288
re-radiated.
So your prediction is,

00:45:02.288 --> 00:45:05.212
for the same amount of mass
falling onto a neutron star as

00:45:05.212 --> 00:45:07.980
onto a black hole,
you would predict that the

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.619
neutron star would be brighter,
because all of this extra

00:45:11.619 --> 00:45:14.934
energy brought in by the
accreting material would be

00:45:14.934 --> 00:45:17.808
radiated--whereas,
in the case of the black hole,

00:45:17.808 --> 00:45:19.924
it would not be.
It would just be captured by

00:45:19.924 --> 00:45:23.792
the black hole itself.
So, with the most sophisticated

00:45:23.792 --> 00:45:28.353
recent x-ray telescope,
people have tried to measure

00:45:28.353 --> 00:45:33.630
black holes and neutron stars in
a situation where they emit

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:38.550
comparable amounts--where the
mass accretion rate,

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.460
the amount of mass that's being
accreted, is comparable.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:44.519
So, the black things here are
the black holes.

00:45:44.519 --> 00:45:47.250
The open circles are the
neutron stars.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:52.719
This is a measure of brightness
and it's logarithmic.

00:45:52.719 --> 00:45:54.619
So, this is 10^(-8),
10^(-6) and some silly set of

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:56.065
units.
And so, this,

00:45:56.065 --> 00:46:00.170
between here and here,
that's a factor of 100.

00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:03.653
This is the orbital period.
The reason they plot the

00:46:03.653 --> 00:46:06.803
orbital period is,
there's good reason to think

00:46:06.803 --> 00:46:10.570
that the amount of mass
accretion is proportional to the

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:13.552
orbital period.
So, you expect long orbits to

00:46:13.552 --> 00:46:16.000
have more mass accretion than
shorter ones.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.039
But the point of this graph is
clear.

00:46:18.039 --> 00:46:22.638
There's a gap you can drive a
truck through of about a factor

00:46:22.638 --> 00:46:26.699
of 100 in the brightness between
the neutron stars,

00:46:26.699 --> 00:46:28.775
the things that we think are
neutron stars,

00:46:28.775 --> 00:46:30.949
and the things we think of as
black holes.

00:46:30.949 --> 00:46:35.046
And so, the interpretation of
this has been that the black

00:46:35.046 --> 00:46:38.775
holes don't have a surface.
Because if they had a surface,

00:46:38.775 --> 00:46:41.572
then all of this extra energy
would have to radiate,

00:46:41.572 --> 00:46:44.150
as it does in the case of the
neutron stars.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:48.743
So, this is a first step
towards a test of strong-field

00:46:48.743 --> 00:46:51.706
general relativity.
It's only a first step,

00:46:51.706 --> 00:46:54.417
because you really have to
understand how much mass is

00:46:54.417 --> 00:46:56.603
falling,
and what the geometry of the

00:46:56.603 --> 00:46:58.806
mass flow is,
and a whole bunch of very

00:46:58.806 --> 00:47:01.688
complicated gas dynamics.
This is sometimes called

00:47:01.688 --> 00:47:03.852
"gastrophysics."
And so, that's what we're

00:47:03.852 --> 00:47:06.396
working on doing now,
to try and understand exactly

00:47:06.396 --> 00:47:08.280
what's going on with these
things.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:14.275
And if one understood that,
then you might take such a plot

00:47:14.275 --> 00:47:19.340
to represent a proof that event
horizons exist.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:23.533
And so, that kind of brings you
up to 2007, in the study of

00:47:23.533 --> 00:47:26.570
strong-field relativity and
black holes.

00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:29.139
And that's the end of this
section of the course.

00:47:29.139 --> 00:47:31.739
That's the end of this section
of the semester.

00:47:31.739 --> 00:47:35.914
Have a good break and we'll
torment you with a test

00:47:35.914 --> 00:47:36.914
afterwards.

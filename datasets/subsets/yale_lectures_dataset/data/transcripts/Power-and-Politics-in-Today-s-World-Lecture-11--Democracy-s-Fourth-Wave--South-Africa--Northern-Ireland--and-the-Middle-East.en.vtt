00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.370
- So, in the last several lectures,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.360
we've been looking at the combined effects

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.530
of the disappearance of communism

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.410
as a viable alternative,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.960
both in practice and in the imagination

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.700
of mainstream political thinking

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.470
as a serious economic alternative

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.890
to capitalism on the one hand,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.510
and then on the other,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.510
the effects of the declining
power of organized labor,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.300
vis a vis capital,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.300
in many of, if not all, of
the Western democracies.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.020
And the effects of that
have been to enhance,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.120
in one way or another, the prestige

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.680
of what was called neo-liberalism at home

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.310
and the Washington consensus abroad.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.520
And we've seen how this played out,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.400
particularly in the
agendas of privatization,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.400
the increasing independence
of private money in politics

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.220
that we talked about last time,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.840
and the erosion of what had been

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.337
the social democratic
consensus in Western Europe

00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:20.770
and the great society
in the United States.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.980
The next four lectures,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.720
we're gonna refocus attention
back to the global order

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.440
and particularly the
idea that gained currency

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.440
in the first decades after the
collapse of the Soviet Union

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.060
and the end of the Cold War,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.310
that there really was
gonna be a new global order

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.680
marked by the spread of democracy at home

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.770
and the, it was the spread
of democracy within countries

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.770
and the reshaping of global
international institutions.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.610
And that's basically
what's gonna preoccupy us.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.440
The first two lectures
are gonna be focused on

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.090
the spread of democracy or the expectation

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.490
that it was going to
spread around the world,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.770
and then the next two are going to deal

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.800
with international institutions.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.360
If there was going to be

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.980
a new, global, geopolitical order,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.713
what form would people expect it to take?

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.090
I've called the lecture today

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.080
Democracy's Fourth Wave, question mark,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.560
and I'm gonna focus
principally on South Africa

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.460
as a remarkable transition
with some comparisons

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.460
to the Middle East and Northern Ireland.

00:02:38.238 --> 00:02:41.670
But I should say something
about this language of waves.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.670
So, the idea of waves of democracy

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.970
came into currency, at least
in the academic literature,

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.590
in a book by Samuel Huntington

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.110
published in 1991 called "The Third Wave",

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.780
and it had, and I'll
talk a little bit more

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.320
about the waves in detail shortly,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.500
but Huntington had argued that

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.313
a third wave of democratization
following the first two,

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.760
the first wave having
been the older democracies

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.220
that democratized very slowly

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.160
over the course of the 19th
and early 20th centuries,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.860
the second wave being mostly the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.440
democracies that emerged in
the era of decolonization,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.910
of Africa and Asia after World War II,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.040
and Huntington posited
that despite expectations

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.030
he, among others, had
written an article in

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.990
I think it was in the late
'70s, maybe in the early '80s

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.400
predicting that we wouldn't
see much more democracy.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.870
By 1991, in "The Third Wave" he said,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.400
well, we can really date this
new wave of democratization

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.040
to the Portuguese Revolution of 1974,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.720
which led to democratizations

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.430
in the former Portuguese
colonies and elsewhere.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.780
He had...

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.390
By the time he wrote that book,

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.210
he had also seen the democratizations
across Eastern Europe

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.920
which had largely occurred in 1989,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.230
but the changes in the Soviet
Union lay in the future

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.600
and so he didn't have
anything to say about that.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.640
And, indeed, he had very little to say

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.300
about the South African transition

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.430
that we're gonna focus on today,

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.560
which was also mostly in the future.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.090
And the other books that
came out around that time,

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.320
such as Adam Przeworski's
"Democracy and the Market",

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.440
also were basically looking at this period

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.480
in the last part of the 20th century

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.790
from 1974 through

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.930
the redemocratization of Eastern Europe,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.010
and they thought, "Is
this the third wave?"

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.590
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.340
and some of the developments
we're gonna be talking about

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.550
over the next several lectures,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.210
there's been a lot of
speculation about a fourth wave

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.620
that would incorporate some of the cases

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.450
like the South African transition,

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.610
the Arab Spring that

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:30.100
was much heralded in 2011 and 2012.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.740
And we'll hold off assessing
whether or not we think

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.300
there's a fourth wave
is under way or likely

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.830
until we've gone through looking at

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.520
the conditions for the creation
and survival of democracy

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.520
and how we should think
about the various efforts,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.980
some successful, some not,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.253
at democratization in recent times.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.630
So, the South African
transition to democracy

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.020
which occurs in the late
1980s and really starts

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.020
and goes through the
first election of 1994,

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.680
one thing to say about it was
a highly improbable outcome.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.380
Nobody really expected it.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.610
Indeed, if you go back to the 1970s,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.130
which is when I started
out in political science,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.710
it was a very common

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.830
observation to say that some of the

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.470
political conflicts in the
world were just so difficult

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.110
they were never gonna be solved.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.380
They were, basically, sort of

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.270
the political basket cases of the world.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.510
The conflicts were just
too entrenched, the

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:49.580
possibility of a successful
outcome too elusive,

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.260
and that we just have to sort
of come to grips with the fact

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.740
that there's some political
conflicts that can't be solved.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.000
And the three exhibits that
were always wheeled out

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.430
to make this point were the conflict

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.580
between Protestants and
Catholics in Northern Ireland,

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.920
the Israel/Palestine conflict
which had been going on

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.570
in one form or another
since 1948 at least,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.303
and South Africa,

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:20.450
the struggle between the apartheid regime

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.100
which had come to power in 1948

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.030
but had replaced a previous

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:30.140
government that had also
been heavily racist.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.217
And many times, people said,

00:07:33.217 --> 00:07:35.357
"Well, the South African conflict

00:07:35.357 --> 00:07:39.070
"is the most intractable of intractables."

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.600
Partly because it was based on race

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.140
and racial exclusion is very difficult

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.590
to split the difference when you're...

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:53.220
One of the terms we use in
talking about identity politics

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.100
is that identity politics tends to involve

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.330
indivisible goods, not divisible goods.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.690
If you think back to
our earlier discussion

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.660
of the divide a dollar game,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.500
that presumes that you're dealing

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.817
with a divisible good, right?

00:08:07.817 --> 00:08:10.690
So, you can divide it up in
different ways and you can get,

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.510
therefore, you can form different
coalitions and so forth.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.620
When you're dealing
with indivisible goods,

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.570
those options are unavailable.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.460
So, we had an indivisible
good, namely race,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.960
and then we had a small, white minority,

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.960
less than 20% of the
population, considerably less,

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.630
and they were in power

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.300
and had no, they were in control

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.430
of the most powerful military
in South Africa, in Africa

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.320
until the prospect of a
transition became real,

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.500
they were widely known
to have nuclear weapons,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.900
which they eventually gave up,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.623
and it didn't seem like they
would give up with a fight,

00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.880
without a fight and go anywhere.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.080
And so most people,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.280
even people who thought
the system was unstable,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.210
which many people did,

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.650
thought that it would be
much more likely to end

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.560
in a civil war or a bloodbath.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.750
And, of course, it was also
wired into the Cold War

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:17.690
because it was seen as
staunchly anti-communist and so

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.920
supported by many Western
governments in the 1980s.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.160
And, indeed, in the US
there was a huge fight

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.210
over sanctions against South Africa

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.430
during the Reagan administration

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.240
when the Democrats controlled
Congress, as you now know,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.460
and eventually the sanctions were passed

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.300
over Ronald Reagan's veto

00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:44.310
in the mid-1980s, which is
a difficult thing to do.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.220
You need two-thirds in both houses.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.884
So, you can see, by the 1980s,

00:09:49.884 --> 00:09:52.680
the support for the South African regime

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.653
was certainly hemorrhaging
in the advanced democracies,

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.550
but, nonetheless, they were
wired into the Cold War

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.640
until the end of it

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.440
and so didn't come under great pressure

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.330
from Western governments,

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.290
certainly not the US government.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:14.870
So, when I left South Africa in 1972,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:17.610
I didn't believe I would ever go back.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.640
I thought that the possibilities

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.640
for a white, young, white person
of my, I was 15 years old,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.140
the possibilities for making a life there

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.610
were virtually non-existent.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.890
By that time, once you had turned 16,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.710
they would not give you a passport

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.990
if you hadn't been to the military,

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:37.233
and by that time,

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.760
military service increasingly

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.910
was not sitting around in the desert

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.570
being ordered about by a lance corporal

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.750
but doing crowd control
in places like Soweto,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:52.020
and I decided it was not for me.

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.360
And I really did...

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.190
And my beliefs were not unusual.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.910
The vast majority of people
in the 1970s would have said

00:11:02.058 --> 00:11:06.434
this conflict is gonna get
worse before it gets even worse,

00:11:06.434 --> 00:11:11.434
(students laugh)
and the outcome is not,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:14.820
certainly a good outcome was not in view.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.190
And so, the world was shocked

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.810
on the second of February in 1990,

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.110
when Americans turned on the evening news

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.713
and this is what they heard.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.040
- [Announcer] Sitting in
tonight, Diane Sawyer.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:32.873
- Good evening.

00:11:32.873 --> 00:11:34.100
They were bold words,

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.210
words that millions of people
had waited years to hear.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.130
Today, in a 45-minute
State of the Nation speech,

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.230
President F.W. de Klerk
transformed 30 years

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.020
of South African politics.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.580
He declared the African National Congress,

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.980
the major black opposition
group in South Africa,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.050
to be legal.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.090
He promised that its most famous leader,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.500
Nelson Mandela, would soon be free.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.223
Our first report is from ABC's
Richard Sergay in Cape Town.

00:12:00.108 --> 00:12:02.280
(crowd singing joyfully)

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.110
- [Richard] Nearly 5000 people
who gathered near Parliament

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.893
to protest against Apartheid
today wound up celebrating.

00:12:10.442 --> 00:12:12.240
- It's like a dream
come true, that's true.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.275
- It's a big step forward,
a big step forward.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:16.330
(brass band playing)

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.370
- [Richard] Opening his first

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.480
parliamentary session as president,

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.250
de Klerk made one thing clear right away.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.430
The government is ready
to begin negotiating

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.900
South Africa's future
with the black majority.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.173
- The season of violence is over.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:35.120
The time for reconstruction
and reconciliation has arrived.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.730
- [Richard] de Klerk told his colleagues

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.900
he was implementing a
series of immediate reforms,

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.100
partially lifting the state of emergency,

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.850
suspending executions,

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.280
and easing restrictions on
internal opposition groups.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.938
Then came the biggest change in policy.

00:12:49.938 --> 00:12:52.410
- The prohibition of the
African National Congress

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:55.610
is being rescinded.
(crowd cheers)

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.360
- [Richard] For the
first time in 30 years,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.883
the white government's
sworn enemy, the ANC,

00:12:59.883 --> 00:13:03.320
will be allowed to operate
openly in South Africa.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.340
It wasn't until the end of his speech

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.330
that de Klerk finally mentioned the name

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.560
everyone was waiting to
hear, Nelson Mandela.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.270
- That the government
has taken a firm decision

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.540
to release Mr. Mandela unconditionally.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:18.630
I am serious about bringing this matter

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.850
to finality without delay.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.130
- [Richard] But de Klerk says
Mandela won't be released

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.100
until what the president called
his personal circumstances

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.080
and safety are worked out.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.560
de Klerk has met nearly all the conditions

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.110
that Mandela had set for leaving prison.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.690
- I believe that we have
to give Mr. de Klerk

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.900
very, very considerable credit,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.790
and we may be seeing

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:44.140
history in the making.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.470
- [Richard] But leaders of
the African National Congress

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.909
in exile were more cautious.

00:13:48.909 --> 00:13:53.909
- Quite clearly, an important
step forward has been made.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.280
But perhaps it's half of a step.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.150
- [Richard] Still,
President de Klerk's speech

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.010
confirmed the worst fears
of white conservatives.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:09.380
- We were fighting with
everything we have to retain

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.450
the right of self-determination
of the white people

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.480
and to secure that there
will be no domination

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.600
of black people over whites.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.330
- [Richard] Growing
pressure here and abroad

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.630
for real change left de Klerk
with very little choice.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.467
Today, he challenged
critics on both sides.

00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:27.417
"Walk through the open door," he said.

00:14:27.417 --> 00:14:30.120
"Take your place at
the negotiating table."

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.743
Richard Sergay, ABC News, Cape Town.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:38.080
- So, that was an
astonishingly dramatic moment.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.500
It's hard to overstate, as I said,

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.710
how much it surprised many
people across the world.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.280
And not only that.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.760
Everything that de Klerk
said, he followed through on.

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.230
In early...

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.210
Early in that year,

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:56.670
they unbanned all illegal
political organizations,

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.570
they released all political prisoners,

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.040
including Mandela from his prison,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.170
and legalized all political organizations,

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.430
many of which had been banned.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:13.130
They then, over the course
of the next three years,

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:17.083
negotiated a settlement and
voluntarily gave up power,

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.913
and since that time, we've had
elections in '94, '99, 2004,

00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:27.043
2009, 2014, and 2019

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.500
which have been judged by
independent organizations

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:37.420
to be genuine elections,
free and fair elections,

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.913
not rigged elections.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.250
It is true that the

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.300
South Africa has not passed
what political scientists

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.020
sometimes refer to as
the two turnover test.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:51.853
The political scientists

00:15:51.853 --> 00:15:54.790
don't like to call a country a democracy

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.160
until it's happened twice

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.160
that a government has lost an election

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.498
and actually given up power.

00:16:00.498 --> 00:16:03.170
'Cause you don't know what they'll do

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.770
if they lose an election,

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.830
and we don't know what the ANC would do

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.340
if it lost an election.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.250
So, in that sense, it's not a consolidated

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.650
or an established democracy,

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.100
but there are some pretty reasonable signs

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.820
in a sense that, first of all,

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.690
we have had turnover in the leadership.

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:26.590
We haven't had a sort of situation

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:31.590
as with Mugabe in Zimbabwe where
he staggered on for decades

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.870
until he was finally dragged out of there.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.200
Instead, we've had

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.100
hard-fought but nonetheless
successful transitions

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.910
after Mandela stepped down after one term.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.500
Some people say his most important,

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:50.000
the most important decision
of his premiership because it

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.330
was a norm-setting

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:56.113
that people don't stay indefinitely.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:00.053
Followed by our provost yesterday.

00:17:03.181 --> 00:17:05.160
Then we had transition

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.350
to Mbeki, to Zuma,

00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.420
and then a very hard-fought transition

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.900
to Cyril Ramaphosa more recently,

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.050
but we have seen people giving up power

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.630
in the leadership of the ANC.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.630
And then it's also the case that the ANC

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.930
has become accustomed to losing elections

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.060
and giving up some power

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.000
because in addition to Cape Town,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.210
which is controlled by the opposition

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:36.340
Democratic Alliance for a long time,

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:37.310
they have in

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.122
more recent elections,

00:17:41.122 --> 00:17:45.530
they have lost control of
the other major cities,

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.580
Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, and Johannesburg

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:50.940
to opposition parties.

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:51.930
And so...

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.280
And local politics is not
unimportant in South Africa,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.130
and so the notion that
when you lose an election

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.990
you actually give up power,

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.010
while it's not been embedded

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.630
at the level of the national government

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:10.630
has some traction in the
South African experience.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.950
There are many problems with corruption

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.190
in South African politics,

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.050
much of which will concern us,

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.030
or the causes of it will concern us

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.970
on next Tuesday,

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:27.970
but by the standards of the
evaluation of most democracies,

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.980
South Africa looks pretty good.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.267
They have the other indicators
you might be concerned about.

00:18:34.267 --> 00:18:38.780
They have a relatively free
press, freedom of association,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.060
an operating legal system, and so on.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:47.984
And so certainly by the standards
of many new democracies,

00:18:47.984 --> 00:18:50.973
it's been quite a remarkable story.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.140
So, today's agenda is
we're gonna talk first

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:58.160
a little bit about getting
and keeping democracy,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.170
what's required to get democracy,

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:01.880
what's required to keep it.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.870
This will involve revisiting

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.780
some of the themes of modernization theory

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.520
that I talked about earlier

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.650
when we were talking about China.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.320
Then I'm gonna talk about
transitions to democracy,

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.480
and I'm gonna separate out
four types of transition

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.103
and say something about them.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.300
Then we're gonna zero in
on one of those four types,

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.370
which are negotiated settlements

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.590
of the sort that we
witnessed in South Africa

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.083
during the 1990s,

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.210
and that will lead us to some

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:39.240
evaluation of success,
failure, and inconclusiveness

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.660
by looking at that transition

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.300
in contrast with the continuous
failure after failure

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.010
in the Israel/Palestine conflict

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:53.010
and the more inconclusive
results in Northern Ireland.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.963
Okay, so getting and keeping democracy.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:01.570
There's some historical context to this,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.903
some of which I have alluded to.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.950
Huntington coined the phrase three waves,

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:13.310
and the first wave begins in
the late 18th century, really,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.730
with the American Revolution
and the French Revolution

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.300
and it extends to the early 20th century

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.840
with the enfranchisement
of women in most countries,

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.890
except Switzerland when it didn't come

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.860
for another half century

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:32.933
and the enfranchisement, the reducing the

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.320
voting age often from 21 to 18,

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.020
which came in many
countries during the 1960s.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.120
So, it was a very gradual
and long transition.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.130
And that's not really surprising,
if you think about it,

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.520
because elites were afraid of democracy

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.197
for reasons we've already talked about.

00:20:54.197 --> 00:20:56.760
They had some intuitive

00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.620
grasp of the logic behind
the median voter theorem,

00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.070
although they didn't use that terminology,

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.900
but they were worried.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.733
They were worried

00:21:05.733 --> 00:21:08.380
that if they suddenly
enfranchised the whole population,

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.500
it would threaten their
position and their property.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.610
And so, for instance, in Britain,

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.963
we got significant expansion
of the franchised in 1832,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.443
more in 1867,

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.060
more in 1885,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.810
women in the 1920s,

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.723
and young people,

00:21:28.746 --> 00:21:31.170
18 year olds, in the 1960s.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.470
So, it's a sort of

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.350
some baby steps before big steps.

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:40.280
In the European countries it
happened a little more rapidly.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:45.280
A lot of enfranchisement in
countries like Germany in 1870,

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:50.370
but still, we see a gradual
process of evolution,

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.670
if you like, toward democracy

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.303
rather than universal franchise.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:22:00.240
And that is one thing that
differentiates the first wave

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.530
from the second wave

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.730
because the second wave is really

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.670
bound up with anti-colonial
struggles against Britain,

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.160
particularly, in Africa and Asia

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.090
but also against the
other colonial powers,

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:17.200
and those were countries that went from

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.880
very restricted or no franchise

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:22.580
to universal franchise
more or less overnight.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:26.330
So, it is was a very different
kind of set of transitions,

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:27.523
and they had,

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:32.550
they happened much faster for that reason.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.770
And then the third wave,
as I said to you already,

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.030
is retrospectively dated by Huntington,

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.390
somewhat arbitrarily one might say,

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.610
to the Portuguese Revolution in 1974

00:22:47.610 --> 00:22:49.540
and what subsequently followed

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.080
in Eastern Europe, in
particular, in the late 1980s.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.023
Now,

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:01.200
this creates this talk
about waves of democracy

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.210
and getting more and more democracies.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.280
And indeed by the turn of the 21st century

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.320
we had more democracies in the world

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.520
than more non-democracies

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.000
for the first time in human history,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.660
even if it was the case that more people

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:18.650
lived in non-democracies
than in democracies

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:22.430
because some of the non-democracies
have huge populations,

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:27.080
but, nonetheless, it creates
a kind of air of teleology

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.830
that informed the idea of
the end of history that

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.550
we've already talked about,

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.480
this idea that the world is steadily

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.100
becoming more democratic

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.100
and it just would be a matter of time

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.063
before these waves would come along,

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.873
and eventually the whole
world would be democratic.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:50.240
That was never...

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.720
That was never a very good bet.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.780
So, if you think about the three waves,

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.593
each one of those waves has
had significant undertow.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.810
So, if we think about the first wave,

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.023
yes, we had the revolution
in France in 1789.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.650
By 1791, it had turned into the terror

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:13.650
and something which nobody would think

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.880
was recognizably a democracy.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:20.120
In Europe, in 1830,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.670
across the continent we
had democratic revolutions

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:26.590
in just about every country except the UK,

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:28.410
which had led Marx and Engels

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.100
to think this was the beginning
and the end of capitalism.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:34.420
And even in the UK we had
the Chartist movement,

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.740
which people were terrified

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:38.960
might turn into a revolutionary movement

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.210
or hopeful that it might turn
into a revolutionary movement

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.020
depending on your point of view.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.500
By 1832, those revolutions had collapsed

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.730
and the monarchies had all been restored

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.250
across the continent.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:55.670
The same thing happened in 1848.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:59.630
Again, democratic
revolutions swept Europe and

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:06.290
by 1849, 1850, they
pretty much all collapsed,

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:10.080
and the non-democracies were back.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.000
If we think about the 20th century

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.400
up through the end of the first wave,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.882
of course we had the advent
of fascism, of Nazism

00:25:19.882 --> 00:25:22.480
in Italy and in Germany,

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:27.210
and in the US, massive
retrenchment after the Civil War

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.430
of democratic rights
through the Jim Crow period,

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:32.270
huge disenfranchisement.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.960
I talked about the Supreme Court's reading

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.840
of the Civil War amendments last time

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.830
to restrict their application

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:44.570
and particularly to
restrict the application

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:46.320
of the 15th amendment,

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.120
where you couldn't exclude
people on the basis of race

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.320
but you could find surrogates
like literacy tests

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.740
and poll taxes and so forth.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.870
So, there was lots of undertow

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.290
to the first wave of democratization.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.870
It's not like you get these things

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.500
and then you can't ratchet back.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.533
If you think about the second wave,

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:12.420
again, many, many democracies
that were established,

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.890
when the British left,

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:18.063
the first election turned
out to be the last election.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.270
Lots of theorizing and literature

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.670
and speculation about why that is the case

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.323
or why that was the case.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.110
Perhaps one of the most
plausible accounts is that

00:26:31.518 --> 00:26:36.107
where the British governed
by direct rule, as in India,

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.310
democracy got better traction

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:42.000
because you had whole
generations of Indian elites

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.430
who went to Oxford and Cambridge

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:46.390
and came back and
embedded democratic norms

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:51.050
and values in their institutions
before the British left,

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.693
whereas in South Africa,

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.980
and much of the rest of Africa,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.810
the British governed indirectly,

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:59.560
which essentially was much cheaper

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.740
because you didn't have
to set up your own whole,

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.940
your whole bureaucracy and civil service

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.590
and institutional capacity

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:09.240
and instead found local chiefs

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.300
or sometimes more or
less created local chiefs

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.327
and said, "Provided you
deliver what we want,

00:27:16.327 --> 00:27:18.400
"you can govern as you please."

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.540
And so there was much more
indirect rule in Africa,

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.090
unlike the direct rule in India,

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.060
so some people put it down to that.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.690
Wonderful book on this subject

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.350
by a man called Mahmood Mamdani,

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.360
who's a professor of political science

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.813
and anthropology at Columbia,

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.900
called "Citizen and Subject",

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.700
about the legacy of direct
versus indirect rule.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:45.920
There are other theories,

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.420
and it's not an unproblematic
theory itself because,

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.420
after all, Pakistan had the
same direct rule as India

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.530
and didn't have such a happy,

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.250
democratic future as India did.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.540
So, it's a complex story,

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.440
but, nonetheless, there
was plenty of undertow.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.833
Many, many democracies
that had been created,

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:11.370
as the imperial powers left,

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.923
turned out not to survive.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.100
And then, if we think
about the third wave,

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:23.320
again, there's also been
significant undertow there.

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.380
We've seen,

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.240
I probably should've put
Pakistan on the second wave,

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.290
but much of Latin America.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:33.440
We've seen, we saw
collapses of democracy in

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:39.810
various countries or at least
serious compromising of it

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.660
in Burma, in Fiji, where
coups seem to come and go,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.440
Algeria in 1991 we had a coup,

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:51.800
and of course the ongoing
questions about Russian democracy

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.413
that have become more acute with time.

00:28:54.413 --> 00:28:57.910
So, the idea that
there's some inevitablism

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.550
that democracy's just once you
get it, you keep it forever,

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.440
clearly not true.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.440
Democracies can fall apart
and sometimes they do.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.180
And so that puts on the table the question

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:15.970
so what are the conditions
for democracy to arrive

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:19.533
and what are the conditions
for democracy to survive?

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.290
And that provokes some
theoretical questions,

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:25.130
and there's a huge theoretical literature

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.946
in political science.

00:29:27.946 --> 00:29:31.410
I underlined the science because

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.330
political science aspires
to make predictions.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.750
It aspires to tell us
what the conditions are

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.480
under which we are likely to get

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.060
a particular outcome.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.680
And so, what can we predict?

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.810
And on democratization,

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:52.460
one distinction that
political scientists have made

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:56.260
that was not present in the
early modernization literature

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.093
that I was

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:01.930
talking about when we discussed China

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.620
is a distinction between
transitions to democracy

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.900
and the survival of democracy.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.500
And, in particular,

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.283
Adam Przeworski and his
co-authors in this book,

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.050
published at the turn of the century,

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.110
said we should really think differently

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.930
about these two things,

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.360
and the reason is

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.650
that what produces
transitions to democracy

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.700
is probably inherently unpredictable.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:36.700
It depends on so many
contingencies that have to line up

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.720
that you really can't, you can't predict

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.850
when it's going to happen.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.840
On the other hand, you
can say something about,

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.540
however you get a democracy,
how likely is it to survive.

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.746
And so Przeworski

00:30:51.746 --> 00:30:54.480
and others said we should really

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.720
separate out these two things

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.010
and stop talking about transitions.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:05.010
And so he, his work and the
work of many other colleagues

00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:10.290
represent pretty much a
conventional wisdom about survival.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.120
So, if I, just to do a little polling here

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.653
before I tell you what they say,

00:31:17.530 --> 00:31:20.663
if I said to you, have
we got the microphone?

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.400
What do you think is
most important to have

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.250
for a democracy to survive?

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.633
Anyone. (mumbles)

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.110
- [Student] An educated population.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:41.493
- An educated population
is one possibility, others.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:49.313
- A strong judicial system.
- Strong judicial system.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:58.853
- A healthy economy.
- Healthy economy.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:00.780
Couple more here.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.280
- [Student] I would say that
all actors in the economy

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.160
or in the political system believe

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.730
they can win more from the system

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:14.383
than from trying to overthrow it.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:16.973
- Okay, yep.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.410
- A middle class.
- A middle class.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.693
Barrington Moore supporter
over there, yeah.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.303
So, okay, so,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.560
it is the economy, stupid,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.570
as Clinton is famous for saying.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.560
People used to think political
culture mattered a lot

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.050
or that certain kinds of religions

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.640
were more or less
compatible with democracy,

00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:44.790
but if you look at the data,

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:48.050
none of those things
is much of a predictor.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.900
And so, here are the main things

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:54.220
that people say are important
for a democracy to survive.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.303
One is per capita income of about 14,000

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.613
2019 dollars,

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.060
that if you...

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:07.920
This is Przeworski and his...

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.563
I've converted it into more
2019 dollars, but basically,

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.270
their data set,

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:18.970
which is through the last century
not the current one, shows

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:25.350
that if a country has, if a
country is already a democracy

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:29.430
and has per capita income
of that amount or higher,

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.750
its democracy survives indefinitely,

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.290
and if it falls below that,
it becomes more fragile

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:37.370
and the further below that it falls,

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.033
the more fragile it becomes.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.890
Notice that doesn't say
anything about inequality.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:46.850
Because you can have a
very high per capita income

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:48.960
in a very unequal country.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.100
So, there's per capita income,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.433
then a second is the
diversification of the economy.

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:59.220
This is the whole oil curse literature.

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.727
We talked about this somewhat
in relation to Hirschman,

00:34:02.727 --> 00:34:04.580
"Exit, Voice, and Loyalty",

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:07.970
that if the whole economy
is dominated by one sector

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.810
that's controlled by the government,

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.983
which is usually the case if
it's an oil curse economy,

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:19.860
people will very, be very
reluctant to give up power

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:24.370
if it's the only access to
advancement and success,

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.370
and they'll be very prone
to grab power if they can

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:30.810
if it's the only access to,

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:35.710
provides the only access
to advancement and success.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:40.150
And so when Al Gore didn't
become president in 2000

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.360
in a knife-edge election which he,

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.623
many people thought he'd actually won,

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:46.830
he wasn't happy.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.040
Nonetheless, he could
go on corporate boards,

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.480
go around the world making
movies about climate change,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.650
and I saw his net worth
is 250 million dollars.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.778
It's not so bad for him.

00:34:58.778 --> 00:35:00.930
(students laughing)
Not so bad for Al.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:05.930
It wouldn't be the case if he
lived in an oil curse country.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.040
Now, some people would
say and some people say

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:14.500
oil curse is, generally
speaking, bad for democracy.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.990
And notice that the countries
that have discovered oil

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:22.380
after they've been diversified,
like Norway or Scotland,

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.700
don't have this problem.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.230
So, it's the diversification

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:28.180
which creates multiple opportunities

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.450
for people to advance in the world

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:36.450
other than grabbing the
commanding heights of the state.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.630
It was important, by the way,
in the early American republic

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:43.160
that when the capitol was,

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.973
whether it was in New York,
Philadelphia, or Washington,

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:52.060
these were not places
the elites wanted to be.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.720
They wanted to be out
making money in Virginia,

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.570
on their farms,

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:01.580
and so the desire to hold onto power

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:03.070
was not particularly strong.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:06.460
It wasn't that valuable to them.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.050
And Washington had to be
persuaded to run again.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:12.340
So did Jefferson

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.655
have to be persuaded to
run for a second term.

00:36:15.655 --> 00:36:18.970
That's the kind of thing that

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:20.010
highlights the fact

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.053
that political power wasn't that valuable.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.430
Alternation in power.

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.890
I talked about the two
turnover test already.

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:32.490
So, this is the notion
that if you give up power,

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.560
you're more likely to give
up power in the future.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.690
Alternation predicts alternation,

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:38.960
coups predict coups, right?

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.910
So...

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.793
India maybe got lucky,

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.810
whereas Pakistan didn't
and so then you get...

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.970
There's a big, big...

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:54.030
This is, again, a paper by Adam Przeworski

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:56.850
saying if you get one or two turnovers,

00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:58.620
and certainly if you get three turnovers,

00:36:58.620 --> 00:36:59.983
they go on forever.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.960
Now, what's the causal
story here is another matter

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.700
because it may be the conditions

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.530
that lead to people being given up,

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:12.360
being willing to give
up power once remain.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.870
And so it's not the alternation

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:18.520
that's predicting the giving
up power but the conditions,

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.370
like a diversified economy,

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:23.170
that's actually making them
to keep giving up power

00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:24.520
into the future.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.940
Nonetheless, countries that
have histories of alternation

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.360
tend to alternate,

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.810
and countries where

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:35.890
there's a history of the military

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.590
jumping into politics
when they're not happy,

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.123
they tend to do it.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.727
Another consideration I
will just put out there

00:37:43.727 --> 00:37:46.590
'cause it's been a theme
in the course so far

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.630
and it will be more of
a theme in the future

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:55.170
is my intuition, I haven't done
systematic research on this,

00:37:55.170 --> 00:37:56.163
but that,

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.920
that downward mobility and loss aversion

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.580
are more important than
people give credit for.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.360
So, if you look at some of the countries

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.750
in which democracy has become fragile,

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.930
often it's not the poor

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:15.380
and it's not people
complaining about inequality,

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.990
but it's downwardly mobile people,

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.370
middle class people in Cairo

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:25.630
who find their prices
going up, for example,

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:29.440
and one could give many other examples.

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.200
It can be middle class disaffection

00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.120
when people start to experience or expect

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:39.403
that they're going to
experience downward mobility.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:44.930
But the takeaway is this is
largely an interest-based story.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:48.433
It's not so much norms
or culture, it seems,

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:53.490
but more, more interest-based.

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:57.190
Though, as I said, disentangling
some of the causation

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.930
between the interests and the norms,

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.970
like the norms of giving up power,

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:05.113
can be very tricky to do empirically.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.110
Let's, though, talk about transitions.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:11.280
Przeworski said it's a mug's game

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.180
trying to predict transitions.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.700
Too much contingency in there.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:19.500
And, indeed, after 1989
he wrote a piece saying

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.610
now we're gonna see
hundreds of trees get wasted

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:26.410
by people coming up with
theories of transitions,

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:27.370
and at the end of the day,

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.760
they're not gonna be worth a hill of beans

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.450
because there's too much contingency.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:34.380
Actually, it didn't stop Przeworski

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:37.270
from coming up with his
own theory of transitions,

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:42.163
but be that as it may,
I wanna say not so fast.

00:39:44.158 --> 00:39:48.250
And that while it's true we
can't predict transitions,

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:50.040
we can learn some interesting things

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.350
about the conditions that are necessary

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:54.970
for them to be successful,

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:58.320
and that's what I'm gonna
be talking about next.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:02.870
So, what I wanna do first
of all is single out

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.330
some different kinds of
transitions from one another.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:07.960
They're basically four ways

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.793
to get from non-democracy to a democracy.

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:15.820
One is intervention from outside.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.260
A country goes in and installs
democracy somewhere else.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:23.655
And the two famous success
stories here, of course,

00:40:23.655 --> 00:40:28.130
are West Germany and
Japan after World War II,

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:32.740
and so the notion that you
can't install democracy by force

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:37.720
is obviously false, at least
as a categorical statement.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.053
Now, there are many,

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:42.700
many reasons that people give

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:47.280
about why those installations
of democracy were successful,

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.810
ranging from the fact that
they both had histories

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.600
of democracy in the inter-war period

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.570
to the fact that the Allies
stayed there for decades,

00:40:56.570 --> 00:40:59.560
that they invested in the
Marshall Plan in Germany

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:04.450
and economic resuscitation
of the Japanese economy

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:08.200
to the Cold War and the creation of NATO.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.403
But for whatever reason,

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.980
there have been external
installations of democracy.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.140
We've seen attempts at that

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:21.040
in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.260
that we'll have more to say about later,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.253
where the answer's not so much.

00:41:26.297 --> 00:41:28.790
Perhaps 'cause all of those
conditions were missing

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:30.870
or perhaps for other reasons.

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.860
We'll be digging into that later.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:38.600
The second way in which you get democracy

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:42.300
is by a revolution from
below, democratic revolution.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.880
People are opposed to autocracy.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.420
They get together, have a revolution,

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.143
and create a democracy.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.500
Some success stories there,

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.880
of course, the American Revolution.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.890
People tend not to talk about the US

00:41:56.890 --> 00:41:57.977
when they do comparative policy,

00:41:57.977 --> 00:42:00.720
but the US is one case in the world

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.750
and the American
Revolution was a successful

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.780
revolution from below.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.540
It was of an elite below

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.650
in that was an anti-colonial
revolution run by an elite.

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:15.320
Nonetheless, it was a
revolution from below.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:18.150
The Portuguese Revolution,
to a large extent,

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.730
was a revolution from below.

00:42:20.730 --> 00:42:24.040
Of all the 1989 transitions,

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.667
the one that comes closest
to a revolution from below

00:42:26.667 --> 00:42:28.800
was the Romanian transition where

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:35.520
the Ceausescus were just pretty
much wheeled out of a court

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.810
and shot behind a,

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:38.793
behind a barn.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.890
One might say that had the Mensheviks

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.460
been more stronger than the Bolsheviks,

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:51.130
Russia might have had a
democratic revolution in 1917.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.990
The Mensheviks were democrats

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.040
and might have had a
very different history,

00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.833
and it turned out, of
course, they were not.

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:04.630
The Libyan civil war, ongoing civil war

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.280
started out with an expectation

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.330
on the part of NATO and the Western powers

00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:15.770
that it was gonna be, lead
to a democratic transition.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:17.593
Again, not so much.

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.963
Another subject we're gonna revisit.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:24.600
Now, a third path to democracy

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:31.340
is when the elites in
power decide to give it up.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.290
The military decides to leave power

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.793
for reasons that,

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.710
again, people debate.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:44.593
Or even in a non-military
regime, an authoritarian regime,

00:43:44.593 --> 00:43:48.620
the leadership decides to give up power.

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.460
This happens when Juan Carlos

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:54.590
decided to give up power in Spain.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:57.340
It happened in Brazil.

00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:59.560
Of course, there was pressure from below.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.698
It's not, these...

00:44:01.698 --> 00:44:04.210
Another of way of putting it,
these are sort of ideal types.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.610
Many transitions are hybrids,
to some extent, of them,

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.670
so I wouldn't wanna say they
all fit in one of these boxes

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:14.770
but the center of gravity is elite

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.130
willingness to give up power.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.120
Would you look at what happened in Egypt

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.390
in the beginning of the Arab Spring?

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:29.330
The military got strongly
behind the transition,

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.740
for reasons that are

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.423
very well described, I think, by,

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:38.390
in the book "Thieves of State" by,

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.340
who wrote "Thieves of State", somebody?

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.790
Sarah Chayes.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:46.090
They got, very much got
behind the initial revolution,

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:50.620
but of course, they came
roaring back into power

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:52.570
a year and a half later.

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:55.963
So, again, not so successful there.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:44:59.790
And then, this is...

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:03.240
As I said, political
scientists are not famous

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:05.660
for elegant terminology.

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.907
This is Huntington's term, transplacement,

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.330
and the only reason I use that

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:13.780
is Przeworski's term is even less elegant.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.460
He calls it extrication.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.363
It's like going to the dentist.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:21.920
So, what is, how do you get democracy

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.870
by going to the dentist?

00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:28.220
This is a negotiated settlement,
a negotiated transition

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:31.870
from authoritarianism to democracy.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:35.240
And this is, South
Africa's a classic case.

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:37.060
Of the East European ones,

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:39.940
the closest to that was
the Polish transition,

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:42.590
which really starts long before 1989.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:45.110
It starts in the early 1980s

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:48.710
where the Solidarity
movement emerges in Gdansk

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:51.730
and the regime finds it's necessary

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:53.557
to make various concessions to them.

00:45:53.557 --> 00:45:56.940
And it's almost a decade-long
negotiation in Poland

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.840
which culminates in 1989,

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.670
but it's basically a
negotiated settlement.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:08.520
Israel/Palestine and Northern
Ireland, again, not so much.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.560
So, again, you can see that they're

00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:16.870
outside, and from inside
above, below, and negotiated.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:20.853
That sort of exhausts the
universe of possibilities.

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.010
Now, most of the interest

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:28.270
has been in this last
category, among academics,

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.140
and I think that the reason for that

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:34.460
is probably the reason, partly
the reason Przeworski gives,

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.213
that if you think about the other three,

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.840
the extent to which they really depend

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.143
on contingencies is very high.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:45.840
When will...

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.500
Predicting when it'll be the
case that an invading country

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:54.960
will be willing to make
the kind of investments

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.160
that the US made in Germany and Japan

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.762
after World War II seems,

00:47:00.762 --> 00:47:05.253
it seems like a very
difficult proposition.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:10.050
Or predicting, if you
do have a revolution,

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:14.283
whether there'll be divisions
among the opposition groups.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.160
Predicting, if...

00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.570
As I said, if the Mensheviks
had been stronger,

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:20.800
maybe they would have won.

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.300
There were democratic, there
were more democratic forces

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:26.300
in the French Revolution that lost out.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.430
They were less...

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.620
There were people that wanted to restore

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:32.450
some sort of monarchy after
the American Revolution.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:33.283
They lost out.

00:47:33.283 --> 00:47:36.870
But, again, this seems
like contingencies that

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:38.700
you're very unlikely to be able to come up

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.890
with any generalizations about.

00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:44.760
Similarly, with elites deciding

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.370
to transform things from above,

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:49.460
it's probably gonna depend on

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:56.430
unpredictable conflicts among
military or political elites,

00:47:58.466 --> 00:48:02.866
the alternatives that they
have available to them,

00:48:02.866 --> 00:48:05.550
and other things that are gonna be,

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:07.080
from the point of view of coming up

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:10.520
with any kind of
serviceable generalizations,

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.260
accidents of history.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:14.370
So, there is literature,

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:16.520
but by far the most attention

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.210
has been focused on these transplacements.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:24.460
And I think one is that
people have thought,

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.970
actually, they do lend themselves

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.150
to the tools of social science,

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:31.230
even if not predictive tools

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:34.690
in the sense of point predictions,

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.890
that you can use, among other things,

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.510
the term, the insights from

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.210
game theory and you can predict

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:47.620
at least what makes them
more likely to succeed

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.833
or less likely to succeed.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.370
And then I...

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:54.950
This was just my observation.

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:55.783
It could be wrong,

00:48:55.783 --> 00:48:58.960
but I think the other reason
there's so much attention

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:03.280
to negotiated settlements is
that it seems normatively good.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.270
Democratic paths to democracy
seem like a great thing,

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:09.710
that we don't have to
kill thousands of people,

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:11.750
perhaps hundreds of thousands of people.

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:14.460
We can find a way to do it peacefully.

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.123
And so I think the fact that,

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:22.990
that this seems to have
desirable, normative properties

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:26.140
makes people want to understand
what are the conditions

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.110
under which you're likely to get

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:32.380
a negotiated settlement to democracy.

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.683
So, what are the conditions?

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.720
And I'm gonna give you a
sort of stylized picture

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.170
of these kinds of conflicts

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:46.400
and how they tend to get
resolved when they do.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.990
And we can think about it

00:49:49.697 --> 00:49:53.850
as the governing elite,
government on the one side

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:56.060
and then the opposition movement,

00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.610
not a political opposition party

00:49:58.610 --> 00:50:01.773
because probably the opposition is banned,

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:04.670
but there's a government and an opposition

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:06.580
but they're not monolithic.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:07.660
They're not monolithic.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:10.530
They're divided into at least two groups.

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:15.060
And so, you could think
of the standpatters

00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:18.890
or reactionaries who are gonna
fight all change at all times

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:22.660
and then reformers who are
at least open to change,

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.400
on the government side.

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.230
And then on the opposition side,

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.860
you could think about a division,

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:32.490
a mirror image division
into moderates and radicals.

00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:35.490
This is not moderates and
reformers about policy,

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:39.370
but moderates being people
who would, in principle,

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:42.590
be open to a negotiated settlement,

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:44.692
whereas the radicals think,

00:50:44.692 --> 00:50:46.647
"No, we've gotta have a revolution.

00:50:46.647 --> 00:50:49.787
"We've gotta take over
and we've gotta impose

00:50:49.787 --> 00:50:53.997
"a new dispensation on the country."

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:59.990
And what creates the possibility
of a negotiated settlement

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:03.980
is a circumstance in which
reformers and moderates,

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.980
individually, are not powerful
enough to force change

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:11.783
but if they could get
together, they would be.

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:16.700
Right, if they could get
together and form an alliance,

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:17.750
they would be.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:21.490
And so, then, the 64 million
dollar question becomes

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:23.230
well, what are the conditions

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:25.040
that make that

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.570
possible or likely?

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:29.780
And it's not easy.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.490
The first thing to say is it's not easy.

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.713
At least three things have to happen.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:40.940
One is the reformers and
moderates have to agree,

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.430
and if you think of a condition

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:45.480
of a decades-long civil war where

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.210
many people have friends and families

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:52.670
who have been killed in this war,

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:56.140
very high stakes politics, lots of hatred,

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.780
lots of resentment and anger,

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:01.340
it's not obvious that the reformers

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:03.550
and moderates are going
to be able to agree,

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:08.353
even if there are groups
that might be open to change.

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:11.440
A second requirement is that

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:15.690
the standpatters and radicals

00:52:15.690 --> 00:52:20.320
have to be convinced,
co-opted, or marginalized.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.170
If none of the above,

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:24.960
they will throw a wrench
into the whole process

00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.240
and stop it, right?

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.810
Inevitably.

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:30.710
Or they certainly will try.

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:34.920
So, unless they can be convinced,
co-opted, or marginalized,

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.833
they're probably gonna blow
it up before it's done.

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:44.310
And then the third is that
you have to build support

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:46.950
for the new dispensation because

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:49.030
these groups have grassroots supporters,

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:51.630
these groups have grassroots supporters,

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.990
but they're not grassroots
supporters for this.

00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:55.810
They might potentially be,

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:57.900
but they're not gonna drop out of the sky.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:53:00.330
If you're gonna have a
negotiated settlement,

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:03.750
people are gonna have
to build support for it.

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.650
So, those three things have to happen,

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:09.750
and they have to happen at the right time.

00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.080
And we'll see what happens
when they don't happen

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.563
at the right time shortly.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:17.850
Okay, so that's a lot, right?

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:19.160
It's a big menu.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.360
And this means there's a,
for a negotiated settlement,

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.620
there's a kind of threading
the needle quality

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.653
to the whole thing.

00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:29.590
And so when we think about the conditions

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:31.980
for successful negotiations,

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.730
one of them is obviously luck, right?

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:35.743
You need luck.

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.030
And this is

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:42.680
what we're gonna, what
Przeworski was pointing at

00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:45.200
when he said you can't
generalize about this.

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:47.460
And I'm gonna use three
word, three things you need.

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:52.310
You need luck, you need leadership,
and you need legitimacy.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:56.400
The reason you need luck is
there's so many more ways

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.040
for them to fail than to succeed.

00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:02.200
So many things have to line up

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:04.860
in the right way at the right time

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:08.423
in order to get a successful
negotiated settlement.

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:12.930
People often talk about the
importance of leadership

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:14.720
without defining it.

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.590
I'm gonna mean three things by leadership.

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:21.610
One is people with an
unusual appetite for risk.

00:54:21.610 --> 00:54:23.660
Most politicians are

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.480
pretty risk-averse.

00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:28.780
They mostly wanna

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.070
keep what they've got, get re-elected,

00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.743
and stay out of trouble.

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:41.840
Politicians who have
the leadership qualities

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.450
that are gonna be required

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.020
have to have an appetite for risk,

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.855
but it's not just any old risk.

00:54:48.855 --> 00:54:49.970
They...

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:54.130
Gambling is risk-taking but it's reckless.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:56.410
You don't want reckless risk-taking.

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:59.670
You want people that have
good strategic judgment

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.360
about what are the
risks that must be taken

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.390
and how must they be taken?

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:06.270
And to what end?

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:08.570
And in particular,
you're gonna need people

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:11.460
who are willing to take big personal risks

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:15.410
for a cause that's larger than
their own personal interest

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:18.270
and then to have the
good strategic judgment

00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:22.770
to know what is a good calculated risk

00:55:22.770 --> 00:55:27.770
and what is a reckless move
that is not likely to succeed.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:31.410
And the third essential element

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.130
of good leadership is empathy.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:36.030
Now, empathy is not sympathy, right?

00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:38.270
Sympathy is feeling sorry for people.

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:41.490
Empathy is understanding what people need.

00:55:41.490 --> 00:55:44.060
It's seeing the world
from the point of view

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.180
of the person you're dealing with.

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:49.410
Because if you don't
understand what they need,

00:55:49.410 --> 00:55:52.800
you will not have a successful
negotiation with them.

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:57.070
So, those are the three
important elements of

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:01.350
effective leadership.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:03.690
Now, when I say legitimacy,

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:07.240
I'm alluding here to the debate about

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.750
democratization from above and from below.

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:13.640
And so the story here is that

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.607
some people say, "Oh, it's not legitimate

00:56:15.607 --> 00:56:17.097
"if it doesn't come from below.

00:56:17.097 --> 00:56:19.010
"The people have to validate it."

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:21.630
Others say, "No, it's
all about elite pacts,"

00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.670
elites making deals with one another.

00:56:24.670 --> 00:56:28.110
The short answer is that it is both,

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:29.880
and the reason is

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:34.010
that democracy is a public
good in the economist sense.

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.610
It's a technical public good.

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:41.510
Supplying it to some means
supplying it to all, right?

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:44.310
It's not excluded and it's non-rivalrous

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.490
in that some people having democracy

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:51.220
doesn't exclude others
from having democracy.

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.180
So, it's a public good,

00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.430
and it's notoriously difficult

00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:58.660
to supply public goods democratically.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:01.360
And so that means there will be moments

00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:04.290
when elites have to take decisive action,

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:07.400
but if they can't build support

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.683
for the actions that they are taking,

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.820
then they're not going to be successful.

00:57:13.820 --> 00:57:14.653
Yes, sir.

00:57:15.865 --> 00:57:18.310
- [Student] Following the
dividing the dollar game

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.587
and what you mentioned of marginalizing,

00:57:20.587 --> 00:57:23.720
couldn't you just marginalize elites

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.867
or marginalize the lower classes

00:57:25.867 --> 00:57:30.010
and just build a good
enough coalition to go over?

00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:33.190
- The problem there is who is you?

00:57:34.923 --> 00:57:38.400
Okay, there's no you to do it.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.833
So, they have to see it
as in their interest.

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:45.090
So, what I wanna do now is

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:48.470
work through the South African
and Middle East cases here

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:53.320
from the perspective of
these three considerations.

00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:56.820
So, the luck in South Africa,

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.110
what was one thing that was very important

00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:01.143
was a decaying status quo.

00:58:04.054 --> 00:58:05.900
Whatever the future was gonna be,

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.870
South African elites understood

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.583
that it wasn't gonna be
the same as the past.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.500
Partly because the new
generation of black youth

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:18.800
was much more militant than
its, than their parents.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.380
They were burning down their schools,

00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:25.380
they were refusing to study
in the Afrikaans textbooks,

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:29.070
and so on and so the costs
of repression were going up.

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:31.330
That meant the children
of the white elites

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:33.490
didn't want to join the army,

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:37.830
as I indicated the first
minute of this lecture,

00:58:37.830 --> 00:58:42.830
and so the elites felt the
sand shifting under their feet.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.090
That didn't mean you would get democracy,

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:49.890
but it meant that the
status quo was gonna change.

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:52.580
The bankruptcy that ensued in the 1980s

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:56.740
when Citibank refused to
roll over South Africa's debt

00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.100
contributed as well.

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:02.520
Another factor, a contingent
factor that helped a lot

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:07.520
was the disappearance of
communism as a viable alternative,

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:10.530
which made whites much less
frightened of a transition

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:13.170
for reasons I'll talk about on Tuesday,

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:14.800
and for the ANC,

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:18.350
the Soviet Union stopped
funding them in 1983

00:59:18.350 --> 00:59:21.280
because the Soviet Union was
going bankrupt in Afghanistan

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.420
and while it was fighting
Star Wars spending

00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.960
with the Reagan administration.

00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:29.130
And so the ANC was in this situation

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:33.180
of facing the most
powerful army in Africa and

00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:35.750
didn't have the resources.

00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:39.000
They went to the Chinese,
the Chinese said no,

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.470
and that produced a group within the ANC

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:43.380
that was willing to think about

00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:47.350
talking about a negotiated settlement.

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.203
Leadership.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.780
I wanna spend a little
bit of time on this.

00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.800
So, I became very consumed

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:57.550
with the counterfactual.

00:59:57.550 --> 01:00:01.260
Here we had the successful
negotiated transition

01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:03.060
in South Africa

01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:06.650
between Mandela and de
Klerk on the one hand,

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:09.020
and if you look at Israel/Palestine,

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.680
it had many structural
similarities but it had failed.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:16.600
So, but for example, in the early 1990s,

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.250
there had been something
called the Oslo Accords.

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:20.240
People had...

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:24.900
There'd been a lot of
negotiating between the PLO

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:27.077
and the Israeli government,

01:00:27.077 --> 01:00:29.330
and many people started to believe

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:33.160
that there was gonna be a
transition to a settlement.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.160
And if you went there in 2004 or 2005,

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.070
people, most people thought

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:44.910
this is coming to a successful conclusion.

01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:46.130
And, indeed, Arafat

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:50.080
moved somewhat to the middle.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.730
He recognized Israel's right to exist.

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:55.730
He took some other of the
preconditions off the table

01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:58.920
that had been so important,

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.820
and Yitzhak Rabin,

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:03.400
they seemed to be
converging on a settlement.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.310
There was a lot of work had been done

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:07.810
to build support for
it in both communities.

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:09.203
People expected it.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:15.023
Yet when Rabin was assassinated
by a right-wing Israeli,

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:18.930
it all fell apart.

01:01:18.930 --> 01:01:20.563
Peres came into power.

01:01:22.237 --> 01:01:24.570
He temporized, he moved to the right.

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:27.710
Arafat was phoning him three times a week

01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:28.980
saying, "We've gotta get this done,"

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.160
because as he had moved to the middle,

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.850
that's when Hamas emerged on his flank

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:37.700
and seized all the symbols
of Palestinian nationalism.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:41.440
And so he realized he had to get a deal.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.060
Peres tacked to the right,
basically cut off the talks.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:49.010
Netanyahu won an election
six months later anyway,

01:01:49.010 --> 01:01:52.370
and the sort of window
of opportunity closed.

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.910
So, I got interested in

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.760
what would have happened if
Rabin hadn't been assassinated

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.780
and maybe if de Klerk had
been assassinated in 1992.

01:02:03.904 --> 01:02:08.904
How would things have looked
differently today subsequently?

01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:10.243
And so,

01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:14.690
I went and interviewed
de Klerk about this,

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.000
and I asked him.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:19.477
And I said, "What would've happened if you

01:02:19.477 --> 01:02:23.510
"or Mandela had been assassinated
during this process?"

01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:26.350
And the backstory here is that

01:02:27.570 --> 01:02:30.710
as the negotiations had
been getting into trouble

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:36.000
and breaking down, violence
had been increasing in 1991

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.293
and early 1992,

01:02:39.152 --> 01:02:43.820
and this showed up with
increasing white anxiety

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:45.550
which expressed itself

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:47.320
in the government losing by-elections.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.410
They lost three big by-elections in a row.

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.860
And de Klerk came,

01:02:53.860 --> 01:02:56.710
responded to this by going on
television one night one night

01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:59.657
and saying, "I'm calling a referendum

01:02:59.657 --> 01:03:01.787
"on whether I should
negotiate a settlement

01:03:01.787 --> 01:03:04.830
"with the African National Congress."

01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:06.413
So, that's the backstory here.

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:09.570
So, what he said was the following.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:10.933
He said, "Well,

01:03:12.017 --> 01:03:17.017
"if Mandela had been
assassinated in the late 1980s,

01:03:17.137 --> 01:03:19.517
"it might have scuttled things because

01:03:19.517 --> 01:03:22.697
"at that time he was having
secret talks with the government

01:03:22.697 --> 01:03:24.757
"and it is not clear there was anyone

01:03:24.757 --> 01:03:26.860
"willing to do that in the ANC."

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.540
And he, Mandela, had kept them secret

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:32.110
because he thought if they failed,

01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:34.640
people could denounce him
as a doddering old man

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:37.160
and it wouldn't damage the ANC's cause.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:38.010
That's what I mean.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:39.510
A willingness to take risks

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:42.413
for a cause that's larger than yourself.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.657
de Klerk said, "In my case,

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:51.440
"if I had been assassinated
after the referendum,"

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.050
which he won by a two-thirds majority,

01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:55.597
he said, "it wouldn't really have mattered

01:03:55.597 --> 01:03:59.617
"because whoever replaced
me would have gone on.

01:03:59.617 --> 01:04:03.327
"But the reason I went on television

01:04:03.327 --> 01:04:05.447
"and announced the referendum was

01:04:05.447 --> 01:04:09.507
"that everyone in my cabinet
would have opposed it

01:04:09.507 --> 01:04:12.367
"and everyone in the national
party would have opposed it.

01:04:12.367 --> 01:04:16.927
"And so I just went in and
announced it as a fait accompli.

01:04:16.927 --> 01:04:19.187
"And if you think of,

01:04:19.187 --> 01:04:22.197
"if you think of a circumstance in which

01:04:22.197 --> 01:04:25.947
"I had been shot before I
had called the referendum,

01:04:25.947 --> 01:04:28.657
"there wouldn't have been
anyone in a position to do it.

01:04:28.657 --> 01:04:30.913
"And even if they had wanted to do it,

01:04:31.847 --> 01:04:35.803
"it's not something a new
president can do as their first,

01:04:35.803 --> 01:04:38.800
"they have to build support
in the cabinet and so on."

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:41.433
So, then it might well have played out,

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:45.440
it might well have played out differently.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.690
That was very important because

01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:50.690
the fact that he won that referendum

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:55.400
and essentially took on the
far right in his own party

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:56.740
meant that

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:02.100
the ANC could convince the skeptics there

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.490
that he was serious,

01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:06.540
that he was essentially burning bridges

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:10.060
with the far right of the
national party establishment

01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:12.880
and making his future depend upon

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.840
getting a successful
negotiation with the ANC.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:20.680
And so that was a level of risk-taking

01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.650
that sometimes what solved what
political scientists called

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:24.980
the commitment problem.

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:26.170
He could...

01:05:26.170 --> 01:05:29.150
Skeptics in the ANC could be persuaded

01:05:29.150 --> 01:05:33.350
by Ramaphosa and Mandela,
who were for negotiations,

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:38.183
that this was a person
with whom they could work.

01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:41.680
I've already, so that was one of the ways

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.643
in which he took on the opposition.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.440
The other thing to say is that

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.283
it's very important to
build support from below.

01:05:51.313 --> 01:05:53.470
If you look at,

01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:56.170
fast-forward to 2000

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:59.260
when Bill Clinton is
about to leave office,

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.320
he decides, like many American
presidents before him,

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.250
that the last thing he's gonna do

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:07.720
is solve the Middle East conflict

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:10.550
on the way out in the summer of 2000,

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:11.510
and he brings

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:19.060
Arafat and the Israeli leader
who by that point was Barak.

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.871
He drags them to Washington and says,

01:06:22.871 --> 01:06:26.857
"You need to make this deal
that wasn't made five years ago

01:06:26.857 --> 01:06:28.800
"when Rabin was killed."

01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:31.403
And they both say no.

01:06:32.753 --> 01:06:35.470
And he tries to, he thinks...

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:37.940
Bill Clinton thought if he
just can get people in a room

01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:39.880
and twist their arms
and look them in the eye

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:42.720
and tell them that they're the
most important in the world,

01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.620
people in the world, he could get it done.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:48.850
And the reason he couldn't get it done

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.390
was that there was no support

01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:53.797
in either community in the summer of 2000.

01:06:53.797 --> 01:06:57.566
The Palestinian support was below 10%

01:06:57.566 --> 01:06:59.810
and the Israeli support was below 8%.

01:06:59.810 --> 01:07:02.360
So, even though it was substantially

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:05.430
the same deal as five years
before, it didn't matter.

01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:06.440
There was no support for it.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.180
There were no constituencies for it,

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:11.550
and this is why below
matters as well as above.

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:15.230
And so all, The Economist was
writing about these articles.

01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:16.680
What's wrong with the Palestinians?

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.240
They never miss an opportunity
to miss an opportunity,

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.570
and so on and so forth.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.040
They didn't understand

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.963
that the dynamics on the
ground were different.

01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:30.500
And so you have to have
the support from below.

01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:34.650
Right, so, we can't predict transitions,

01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:37.300
but we can say something
about what makes them

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:39.650
more and less likely.

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:41.573
For one thing, we can predict failure.

01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:44.763
In 1983,

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:50.070
Gerry Adams became head
of Shin Fein, the IRA,

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:55.070
and people said, "Oh, this
is a new kind of politician.

01:07:55.097 --> 01:07:58.237
"He wears business suits, he
talks like Western politician,

01:07:58.237 --> 01:08:00.900
"maybe there can be a
settlement in Northern Ireland."

01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:03.090
But, of course, in 1983,

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:07.160
you had a conservative
government in Westminster

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.990
that was crucially dependent
on the Northern Irish

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:13.090
for its parliamentary majority.

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.740
So, there was no question.

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:17.830
Far from the status quo
being a wasting asset,

01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:19.950
the sand shifting under their feet,

01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:23.050
there was no possibility that the Tories

01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:25.990
would make a deal with the IRA.

01:08:25.990 --> 01:08:28.680
1997, when Tony Blair comes in,

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.460
Labour's not dependent on
the Northern Irish vote

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:33.540
so then it becomes a possibility,

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.980
and eventually we get
the Good Friday Accords,

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:39.180
which semi-unravel later.

01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:43.240
So, you can think usefully
about the conditions here.

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.450
What is it that's gonna move the elites,

01:08:45.450 --> 01:08:46.283
and will they

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:49.423
think that they can't move?

01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:54.453
Empathy and strategic
judgment, hugely important.

01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:58.270
One thing de Klerk said to me

01:08:58.270 --> 01:09:00.910
that I thought was very
interesting in that interview.

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:02.187
At the end of it, I said to him,

01:09:02.187 --> 01:09:04.717
"What do you think explains the difference

01:09:04.717 --> 01:09:06.137
"between the South African

01:09:06.137 --> 01:09:10.170
"and the Israel/Palestine negotiations?"

01:09:10.170 --> 01:09:14.567
And he said, "Well, one
important difference was

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:17.447
"that when we decided to legalize the ANC

01:09:17.447 --> 01:09:21.457
"and the opposition movements,
we had no preconditions,

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:24.757
"and when the ANC, three months later,

01:09:24.757 --> 01:09:27.767
"decided to suspend the armed struggle,

01:09:27.767 --> 01:09:29.453
"there were no preconditions.

01:09:30.677 --> 01:09:33.673
"We didn't ask them to
recognize our legitimacy.

01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:37.627
"We wanted them to decommission

01:09:37.627 --> 01:09:40.500
"but we didn't make it a
requirement, no preconditions."

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.530
Of course, there are
implicit preconditions,

01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:45.479
in the sense that if you
don't deliver within a,

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.870
before the window of opportunity closes,

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.620
it'll all fall apart.

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:52.037
But he said, "The fact that we,

01:09:52.037 --> 01:09:56.600
"there were no explicit
preconditions meant that

01:09:57.947 --> 01:10:00.060
"we had more room to maneuver."

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.310
And, of course, it meant the spoilers

01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:04.370
couldn't violate the preconditions.

01:10:04.370 --> 01:10:06.977
If you say, "These talks will go on

01:10:06.977 --> 01:10:08.700
"as long as there are no rockets,"

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:10.497
there will be rockets, right?

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.570
So, no pre...

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:15.993
That's empathy, it's understanding.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.260
It's understanding what people need.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:22.390
Mandela understood that
even though the ANC

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:27.210
was opposed to power-sharing
in the permanent constitution,

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:29.990
de Klerk had to get it in
the interim constitution

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:33.120
or there wouldn't have been a transition,

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.420
so he agreed to it and
later on it went away.

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.570
In April 1993,

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:41.940
a black radical

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:45.850
leader, Chris Hani, was murdered,

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:47.470
and the violence erupted

01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:52.170
and it threatened to
engulf the whole process.

01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:55.430
And one of the ways in
which it was tamped down

01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:58.630
was that de Klerk agreed
that the election would occur

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:03.280
no later than a year after Hani's death.

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.760
So, it had to be by April 1994,

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.730
so a definite date that it had to occur,

01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:14.730
and that enabled Mandela and
the ANC to quell the violence

01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:17.390
and move things forward.

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:21.220
So, that's hugely important,

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.710
that you understand what
the other side needs

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:26.000
and make sure they can get what they need,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.343
otherwise it's gonna fall apart.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.550
Exit options, right?

01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:35.370
People have to find it
possible to give up power.

01:11:35.370 --> 01:11:38.150
In South Africa, they
promised an amnesty process.

01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:42.450
They processed civil service
jobs, security for five years.

01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:47.270
This hearkens back to
our earlier discussion

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:51.230
of the Soviet Union, that
the exit costs were lower

01:11:51.230 --> 01:11:54.850
because of the way privatization occurred.

01:11:54.850 --> 01:11:58.050
And when we think about the
demonstration effects here

01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:00.360
of the ways in which

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.310
Gaddafi and Mubarak met
their end, their fates,

01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:08.870
it doesn't all go well
because the leaders in

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:16.440
other countries that might be
facing opposition movements

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.730
think about what'll happen
to them if they leave.

01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:23.063
So, good things don't always go together.

01:12:24.010 --> 01:12:27.750
Let's give de Klerk the last word

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:29.940
before we head out.

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.200
- I think it was an absolute necessity

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:35.160
that he had to be released.

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.270
As his image grew over the years,

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:39.740
as he became

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:43.240
an icon, as he became

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:45.810
a crucial flashpoint

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:50.810
in the whole international
situation also of South Africa,

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.780
it became clear to me that,

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:58.300
that he has a pivotal role to play

01:12:58.300 --> 01:12:59.850
and that he was playing it,

01:12:59.850 --> 01:13:02.590
irrespective of the fact
that he was in jail.

01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:07.373
He was leaner than I thought,
he was taller than I thought,

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:11.090
and my very first impression

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:14.533
was that he was a very dignified man.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.153
We were both reserved,

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.370
but there was immediately

01:13:24.410 --> 01:13:26.060
a sort of a good,

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:30.060
good spark between us.

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.570
He had a few habits.

01:13:31.570 --> 01:13:33.833
Firstly, he was a very good listener.

01:13:36.070 --> 01:13:41.020
He would rarely or almost
never interrupt one

01:13:41.020 --> 01:13:42.493
when one was making a point.

01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:45.510
On the other hand,

01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:48.820
he got highly irritated
if he was interrupt.

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.933
I was scoring points in the debate.

01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:55.053
He leveled the score by,

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.580
fairly near to the end but
before we reached the end,

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:02.450
suddenly reaching out and taking my hand.

01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:04.513
- I am proud to hold your hand,

01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:09.690
for us to go forward together.
(audience applauding)

01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:14.560
- It was a masterpiece,
that taking my hand.

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:15.463
He's good at it.

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:19.763
Ah, I took his hand,
nothing I could do about it.

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:23.610
And lifted quietly my,

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:27.103
in my mind, my hat to him
and said, "Well done."

01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:31.003
- Okay, we'll see you on Tuesday.

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:38.053
(bright ascending notes)

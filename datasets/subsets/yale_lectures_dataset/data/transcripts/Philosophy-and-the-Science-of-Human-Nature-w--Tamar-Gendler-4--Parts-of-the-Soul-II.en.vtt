00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.426
PROFESSOR: So what I would like
you to do is to answer

00:00:04.426 --> 00:00:06.580
the following question.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.035
"Do you have..?" oh, now
wait a second -- this

00:00:10.035 --> 00:00:11.880
says polling closed.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.181
Let's see whether we can
get polling to open.

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.090
Do you...?" -No, that
didn't work.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.250
Oh, this is the most desperately
horrible thing

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.550
that I've ever had happen.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.360
OK.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.990
Current slide.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.235
I've had horrible things happen
that are worse than

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.118
this, I'm sorry.

00:00:25.118 --> 00:00:27.586
I don't want to belittle all
the really horrible things

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:28.504
that have ever happened to me.

00:00:28.504 --> 00:00:29.070
[laughter]

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.780
OK.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.850
So let's try again.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.500
Click practicalities
blah blah.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.060
OK. "Do you have
a clicker yet?

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.460
Polling is open." OK.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.512
And there's ten seconds left.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:43.123
You'll see this little
timeline.

00:00:43.123 --> 00:00:46.765
Eight, seven, six, five, four--
ninety two of you, so

00:00:46.765 --> 00:00:48.530
many of you have clickers.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.740
OK.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.810
Let's see what we learned.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.313
It looks like 97% of
you have clickers.

00:00:57.313 --> 00:00:59.360
[laughter]

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.800
Now!

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.310
I actually began with this
exercise to make a point about

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.625
psychological research.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:19.060
We just made a classic and
dangerous mistake, a mistake

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.944
known as sampling bias.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.970
We used a measure which doesn't
give us accurate

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.390
information about what we
wanted to find out.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.007
We wanted to find out, what
percentage of people in the

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:37.480
room had clickers.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.482
And what we found out instead
was, what percentage of people

00:01:40.482 --> 00:01:43.607
in the room with clickers
had clickers.

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:45.305
[laughter]

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.555
I don't know who you guys are.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.831
This error is an incredibly
dangerous one, and it could

00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:55.004
have persisted.

00:01:55.004 --> 00:01:58.030
Suppose I then ask you a
question whether you're from

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.072
the class of 2014, '13, '12,
or '11, and discovered that

00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:08.380
80% of you were freshmen
and sophomores.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.326
There, then, I would inherited
exactly the sampling bias

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:15.900
error that we just observed.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.063
Freshmen and sophomores
have handed in

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:19.970
their schedules already.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.000
Consequently, they're
certain about what

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.330
classes they're taking.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.815
Consequently, they're
more likely to

00:02:25.815 --> 00:02:28.624
have clickers already.

00:02:28.624 --> 00:02:34.990
So when we do psychological
empirical research, we need to

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.308
be extraordinarily careful that
the means by which we are

00:02:39.308 --> 00:02:44.550
choosing subjects for
experiments are, in fact,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.400
means that give us an accurate
sample of what it is that

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.844
we're interested in.

00:02:52.844 --> 00:02:56.940
An article appeared recently in
the journal Behavioral and

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.310
Brain Sciences with the
title, "The Weirdest

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.180
People in the World".

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:13.080
And "WEIRD" here stands
for Western, educated,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.154
industrialized, rich,
and democratic.

00:03:17.154 --> 00:03:22.173
That is, American college
students.

00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:28.020
People with access to online
Internet polling.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.660
And what the article argued
was that a great deal of

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.870
psychological research that
claims to make general

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.715
assumptions, that claims to
prove general assumptions

00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:50.250
about human nature, is biased
in exactly the way my poll

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.280
concerning what percentage of
you have clickers was biased.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.490
It looks at a small sample of
the population, those who are

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.900
readily available to research
laboratories on university

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.882
campuses, for example, the psych
introductory psych pool.

00:04:10.882 --> 00:04:14.500
And it bases its conclusions
about human

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.210
nature on that sample.

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.676
Throughout the semester we need
to be attentive, when we

00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:26.470
read psychological studies which
are making claims about

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.170
human nature, to the fact that
it is possible that some of

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:35.955
the things which we are told
apply to human beings in

00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:42.750
general instead have at least
being shown conclusively only

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.580
to apply to WEIRD folk.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.386
Western, educated,
industrialized, rich, and

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:51.250
democratic.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.430
And in certain cases, the data
would look very different if

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.066
we looked at a different
population.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:05.962
This is also the case in the
classical texts we used.

00:05:05.962 --> 00:05:11.230
The process that Plato and
Aristotle took on for

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.715
themselves didn't look
experimental in the way that

00:05:14.715 --> 00:05:17.770
experimental psychology
looks experimental.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.880
But they looked at a sample of
people around them, and on the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.410
basis of their experience, they
drew conclusions about

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.110
human nature.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.285
So little reminder of something
that I said in the

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:39.728
first lecture that sometimes
gets lost. In some ways, this

00:05:39.728 --> 00:05:41.673
is a class about philosophy
and the

00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:43.645
science of human nature.

00:05:43.645 --> 00:05:48.244
And in other ways, this is a
class about Western philosophy

00:05:48.244 --> 00:05:52.020
and the science of Western
human nature.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.494
And we need to be attentive to
that when it becomes relevant.

00:05:58.494 --> 00:06:03.740
So what I want to do in today's
lecture is to return

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.820
to the issue that we took up
last class, which is the issue

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.934
about the multi-part nature
of the human soul.

00:06:13.934 --> 00:06:16.940
And you'll recall that in the
last lecture, we were

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.464
introduced to Plato's great
analogy of rational spirit and

00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:28.392
appetite, as exemplified by a
charioteer, a calm horse and a

00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:29.610
wild horse.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.300
And also to a number of
other distinctions.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.865
Left brain, right brain, which
I managed to get wrong four

00:06:37.865 --> 00:06:41.650
times in a row, if I
remember correctly.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.930
We were introduced to the
difference between brainstem

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.460
and upper brain.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.310
We were briefly introduced
to Freud's idea of

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.400
superego, ego, and id.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.580
But we didn't get to work in the
dual processing tradition.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.292
And today's lecture will take up
where the last lecture left

00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:05.940
off, with another way in which
it is typical to distinguish

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.830
parts of the soul.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.780
Let me say that there is very
good reason to think that the

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.530
research which I'm presenting
today is not subject to the

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:18.854
WEIRD objection.

00:07:18.854 --> 00:07:21.190
That is, there have been
powerful cross-cultural

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.462
demonstrations of nearly all
the results which I'll be

00:07:24.462 --> 00:07:26.080
talking about today.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.930
And there are also good
evolutionary reasons to think

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.510
that the two systems which dual
systems theorists posit

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:39.100
are, in fact, going to be part
of any human being because of

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.800
the evolutionary process, which
all of us underwent.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.545
So I wanted to start with a
picture of Edward Thorndike

00:07:48.545 --> 00:07:51.446
not because he's important,
but just because he's so

00:07:51.446 --> 00:07:53.398
fabulous-looking.

00:07:53.398 --> 00:07:57.444
This is from the New York
Public Library Archive.

00:07:57.444 --> 00:08:02.970
Edward Thorndike was a late
19th, early 20th century

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:07.640
psychologist who did a lot of
important associationist

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.670
animal work.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:15.510
But he also did research,
publishing an article in 1922,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:21.610
that in some ways can be seen
as the founding work of the

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.510
reasoning tradition that
Jonathan Evans described in

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:29.405
the article that we read
for last class.

00:08:29.405 --> 00:08:35.340
So he describes, in his 1922
article, an experiment that he

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.935
does, which is titled "The
Effect of Changed Data Upon

00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:41.144
Reasoning".

00:08:41.144 --> 00:08:45.440
And what he's interested in
there is the question of

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.180
whether problems that are
posed to people that are

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.910
formally identical, but that
differ in how that formal

00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:00.140
material is presented, are
processed differently.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.275
So, for example, he asked
people, either what is the

00:09:05.275 --> 00:09:08.963
square of x plus y, (first,
outer, inner, last, I think is

00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:15.126
how you would do it) and he
asked people, what is the

00:09:15.126 --> 00:09:18.930
square of b1 plus b2?

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.150
Whereas people found the first
question easy, they found the

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.482
second question much
more difficult.

00:09:25.482 --> 00:09:28.892
Success rates on this
were up around 90%.

00:09:28.892 --> 00:09:31.520
Success rates on this were
considerably lower.

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.080
Or he asked them, what's the
square of a squared x cubed,

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:40.146
versus what's the square of
r subscript 1 to the 8th r

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.780
subscript 11 to the second?

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.016
And so on.

00:09:45.016 --> 00:09:48.910
Presenting people with problems
that were formally

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.250
identical but which differed in
terms of the complexity of

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.082
the characters used to represent
them produced a

00:09:58.082 --> 00:10:00.550
massive decrement
in performance.

00:10:03.202 --> 00:10:09.692
Fast forward to a period in the
1960s, '70s, and '80s, in

00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:14.959
which people began to study
syllogistic reasoning, and a

00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:21.180
number of special instances
of this phenomenon emerge.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.770
So in Jonathan Evans piece that
you read for last class,

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:29.052
you were presented with
examples like this.

00:10:29.052 --> 00:10:35.784
A syllogism that was valid and
believable - that is, whose

00:10:35.784 --> 00:10:39.102
formal properties guaranteed
that if the premises were

00:10:39.102 --> 00:10:42.624
true, the conclusion was true,
and as a matter of fact

00:10:42.624 --> 00:10:45.084
conclusion was true.

00:10:45.084 --> 00:10:49.940
And arguments that were valid
but unbelievable--arguments

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.706
where the structure of the
argument guaranteed that if

00:10:52.706 --> 00:10:56.160
the premises were true, the
conclusion was true, but where

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.130
the conclusion was false.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.120
So, for example, you might
be told: No Greek

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.450
tragedies are comedies.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.185
Some Greek comedies are plays.

00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:12.760
And asked whether it followed
from that that some Greek

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.900
plays are not Greek tragedies.

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.838
No Greek tragedies are comedies,
some Greek plays are

00:11:17.838 --> 00:11:20.850
comedies, therefore, some Greek
plays are not Greek

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.560
tragedies, and 90% of people
were able to see that that

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.020
argument was valid.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.180
By contrast, you might be given
an argument, equally

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.180
valid, but with an unbelievable
conclusion; like:

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.840
No Russian novels are short.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.670
Some novels by Dostoevsky
are short.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.960
Therefore, some novels
by Dostoevsky

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.320
are not Russian novels.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.550
That's a valid argument.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.405
It's a valid argument with a
false conclusion, because one

00:11:48.405 --> 00:11:51.827
of the premises is false.

00:11:51.827 --> 00:11:56.460
But as a result of the
conclusion being implausible,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:02.532
only 55% of people were able
to recognize that the

00:12:02.532 --> 00:12:05.970
conclusion followed
from the premises.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:12.813
Notice, however, that these
two arguments are

00:12:12.813 --> 00:12:13.695
structurally identical.

00:12:13.695 --> 00:12:19.220
They both have a form, no A's
are B's, some C's are B's,

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.520
therefore, some C's
are not A's.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:28.174
Formal properties alone
don't determine our

00:12:28.174 --> 00:12:31.956
ability to judge validity.

00:12:31.956 --> 00:12:39.030
And, in fact, it is also true
that formal properties alone

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:44.390
don't determine our ability
to judge invalidity.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.240
So whereas valid arguments with
plausible conclusions are

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.330
judged to be valid roughly 90%
of the time, we just heard

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.410
that valid arguments with
implausible conclusions are

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.943
judged to be valid considerably
less often.

00:12:59.943 --> 00:13:05.914
An opposite error arises in the
case of invalid arguments.

00:13:05.914 --> 00:13:09.790
Invalid arguments with plausible
conclusions are

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.520
judged to be valid.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.900
It's judged to be the case that
the form of the argument

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.150
guarantees the truth
of the conclusion.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:23.140
Whereas it turns out that what
guarantees the truth of the

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:26.980
conclusion, in that case, is
nothing other than facts about

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.574
the world, as opposed
to facts about the

00:13:29.574 --> 00:13:33.035
structure of the argument.

00:13:33.035 --> 00:13:41.632
In light of this Thorndikean
condition, researcher after

00:13:41.632 --> 00:13:46.557
researcher came up with research
paradigms that

00:13:46.557 --> 00:13:51.640
demonstrated what we've just
been talking about.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:59.466
So, famously, the Wason
selection task asks people to

00:13:59.466 --> 00:14:04.733
determine which of four cards
they need to turn over to

00:14:04.733 --> 00:14:06.580
verify the truth
of a statement.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.205
So, for example, I might give
you a statement, "if there's

00:14:09.205 --> 00:14:13.867
an A on the one side, there's
a three on the other." And I

00:14:13.867 --> 00:14:17.330
might present you with four
cards, and ask you which ones

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.530
you need to turn over.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:22.620
Obviously, you need to turn
over the A, and everybody

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:23.780
recognizes that.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.910
You need to check whether
there's a three

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:27.644
on the other side.

00:14:27.644 --> 00:14:31.935
Obviously, you don't need to
turn over the D. You know that

00:14:31.935 --> 00:14:34.130
the cards have a letter
on one side, and a

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.450
number on the other.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:37.891
So there's no worry that
there's an A on the

00:14:37.891 --> 00:14:39.695
other side of here.

00:14:39.695 --> 00:14:43.805
But people have a tendency to
think that you need to turn

00:14:43.805 --> 00:14:46.920
over the three, and that
you don't need to

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.610
turn over the seven.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.910
But look out.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.280
Right on that other side of the
seven was an A. and the

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.824
statement turns out
to be false.

00:14:58.824 --> 00:15:04.440
The ones you need to check
are the A and the seven.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.450
People find this task relatively
difficult.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:13.370
But here's a structurally
identical task that people

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.650
find relatively easy.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:21.390
"If a person is drinking beer,
the person must be over 21." I

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.460
show you four cards.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:28.660
The beer drinker, the soda
drinker, the over-21 year old,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.478
and the 17 year old.

00:15:31.478 --> 00:15:34.766
And every single one of you
could I take it get a job as a

00:15:34.766 --> 00:15:40.070
bouncer, walk in, discover
that the 17 year old is

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.480
drinking a beer.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.290
And thereby, learn exactly
what was hard to see in

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:50.040
earlier case, that the cards you
need to turn over are the

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:57.806
first and the last, rather than
the first and the third.

00:15:57.806 --> 00:16:02.502
Now, there have been all sorts
of explanations hypothesized

00:16:02.502 --> 00:16:06.590
for why it is that we find the
second of these tasks easier

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:11.460
than the first. Perhaps the
most famous of these is a

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:15.030
hypothesis advanced by the
evolutionary psychologists

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:20.430
Leda Cosmides and John Tooby,
who argue that we have within

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:25.295
ourselves what they call a
cheater detection module, and

00:16:25.295 --> 00:16:28.528
that we're enormously sensitive
to cases that

00:16:28.528 --> 00:16:33.874
involve violations of
normative rules.

00:16:33.874 --> 00:16:38.876
So you notice that the second
one is different from the

00:16:38.876 --> 00:16:41.530
first in two ways.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:45.790
One is that it's socially
embedded, whereas the first is

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:46.660
purely abstract.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:50.114
And we'll discover, as we
continue our readings this

00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:55.410
semester, that social embedding
awakens reasoning

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:58.350
processes that aren't
present otherwise.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:04.480
In fact, we learned that last
week, with the eyes study when

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.400
we learned that people are more
pro-social, more likely

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.520
to engage in morally normative
behavior, when they're

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.910
presented visually, with eyes,
in part, because it awakens

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.878
and activates a kind of social
understanding which all of us

00:17:20.878 --> 00:17:21.364
have.

00:17:21.364 --> 00:17:24.020
So the first difference between
the bottom and the top

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:29.130
is that the bottom one invokes
sociality, whereas the top one

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.490
is purely abstract.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.830
And the second difference
between the bottom and top is,

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:37.280
of course, that this is
a normative rule.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.810
It's about how things
ought to be.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.700
Whereas this is a descriptive
rule.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.220
It's about how things are.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.046
So the lesson that we can take
away from the Wason selection

00:17:49.046 --> 00:17:51.937
task, for those of you who are
interested in it, there have

00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:54.510
been thousands and thousands
of variations done on it,

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.660
which are extremely interesting
in sorting out

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.372
exactly where people are good
and not so good at the task.

00:18:01.372 --> 00:18:06.000
The lesson that we can take
away from it is the lesson

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.903
that has been emphasized
throughout this lecture and

00:18:09.903 --> 00:18:11.450
the previous one.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.460
That we have ways of processing
information that

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:20.408
don't merely track formal
properties.

00:18:20.408 --> 00:18:25.640
And some of those ways of
processing information involve

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:32.140
bringing on line, so to speak,
what Plato would call parts of

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.300
the soul which had not
been previously

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:39.410
attentive to the situation.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.590
Now--

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.550
Is there a question
in the back?

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.536
STUDENT: Yeah, sorry.

00:18:43.536 --> 00:18:47.110
For the last one, what exactly
were the subjects asked to do?

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.959
I don't really understand
the experimental design.

00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:51.600
PROFESSOR: So the experimental
design for both of these cases

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.495
was as follows.

00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:54.730
You're given a sentence
that you need to

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.640
verify the truth of.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.356
So you're asked is it true that
if there's an a on one

00:19:00.356 --> 00:19:01.854
side, there's a three
on the other?

00:19:01.854 --> 00:19:05.000
Is it true that if a person is
drinking beer, the person must

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.590
be over 21?

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:10.473
And you're told that you have
four items in front of you,

00:19:10.473 --> 00:19:14.890
and you're asked, which ones
do you need to turn over to

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:16.370
verify the statement?

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:18.998
So to verify the statement, if
there's an a on one side,

00:19:18.998 --> 00:19:21.300
there's a three on the other
side, you need to turn over

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.390
the a and the seven, not
the a and the three.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.835
And that should become obvious
to you if you look at this

00:19:26.835 --> 00:19:30.365
case, where to determine
whether the person was

00:19:30.365 --> 00:19:33.890
drinking beer, the person must
be over 21, you need to turn

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:38.760
over the card belonging to the
beer drinker, and the card

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.400
belonging to the person who
is in fact not over 21.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.685
So does that clarify?

00:19:44.685 --> 00:19:45.990
Excellent.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:47.120
OK.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.670
So dual processing accounts
attempt to provide a general

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.890
explanation for what's going
on in the cases I've just

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.300
described, and in the cases
I'm about to describe.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.871
They suggest that we have two
relatively autonomous

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:10.030
mechanisms for processing
information, and they're

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.920
called all sorts of things,
but what's become the most

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:18.010
normative way of describing
them, is to call them simply

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.910
system one and system two.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.790
So whereas system one is
evolutionarily primitive--it

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.935
makes use of parts of the
brain that came into our

00:20:28.935 --> 00:20:32.087
evolutionary process relatively
early in the

00:20:32.087 --> 00:20:36.440
game--system two is
evolutionarily relatively

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:39.510
recent, it involves higher
cortical function.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.300
System one is unconscious, or
preconscious, whereas system

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.174
two is conscious.

00:20:45.174 --> 00:20:49.340
System one operates
automatically, whereas system

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.130
two is consciously controlled.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:56.611
System one is effortless, it
happens without our trying.

00:20:56.611 --> 00:21:00.734
System two is effortful, in the
sense that it involves an

00:21:00.734 --> 00:21:01.917
expenditure of cognitive
energy;

00:21:01.917 --> 00:21:04.390
you have to pay attention.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.970
System one is super fast. It
processes information almost

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:10.490
instantaneously.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:12.680
System two is, relatively
speaking--

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.900
slow, the information that we
get through system two takes

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.384
considerably longer: seconds
rather than milliseconds.

00:21:19.384 --> 00:21:21.256
System one is associative.

00:21:21.256 --> 00:21:24.320
It recognizes patterns
in the world.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.170
System two is rule-based.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.700
It can apply principles.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.050
System one is, people sometimes
say, reflexive --

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:36.435
it happens without reflection,
which is what

00:21:36.435 --> 00:21:40.420
underlies system two.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:46.066
So the distinction between
system one and system two is

00:21:46.066 --> 00:21:51.890
the result of many decades
of work by many people.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.600
Here's a chart from a different
paper by Jonathan

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.655
Evans in which he enumerates--

00:21:57.655 --> 00:22:01.030
and this will be available
to you on the V2 site--

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:06.220
some of the many researchers
whose work went into talking

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.100
about system one
and system two.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:14.030
And I want to point out to you
one important thing here,

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.486
which is that it's a bit
misleading to speak of system

00:22:17.486 --> 00:22:22.428
one and system two as if they
are individual things.

00:22:22.428 --> 00:22:26.990
System one is sometimes called
the autonomous set of

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.120
subsystems. The idea: there is
the visual processing, and the

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.355
auditory processing, and there's
processing that gives

00:22:33.355 --> 00:22:37.170
us very specific information
about things like faces, or

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:40.220
the average length of lines,
or that enables us to

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.280
recognize something as
predator or prey.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.722
All of those systems have
the characteristics

00:22:46.722 --> 00:22:48.130
that system one does.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:50.034
They're quick, they're
unconscious, they're

00:22:50.034 --> 00:22:52.690
evolutionarily primitive,
they come online without

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:53.700
reflection.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.110
But they are not, each of them,
they are not altogether

00:22:58.110 --> 00:23:01.790
a coherent system.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:07.236
So dual processing accounts are
a way of trying to make

00:23:07.236 --> 00:23:11.907
sense of a set of phenomena,
some of which have to do with

00:23:11.907 --> 00:23:17.665
the processing of reasoning,
and some of which, as we

00:23:17.665 --> 00:23:22.420
learned in the absolutely lovely
Nobel Prize speech of

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.605
Daniel Kahneman, which I asked
you to watch for today, some

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:33.674
of which takes place in a more
general domain of reasoning.

00:23:33.674 --> 00:23:36.421
And I've reproduced for you
here Kahneman's beautiful

00:23:36.421 --> 00:23:39.805
chart explaining his
understanding of the relation

00:23:39.805 --> 00:23:42.060
between system one
and system two.

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.606
Where he talks about the
similarities between

00:23:45.606 --> 00:23:48.860
perception and intuition
on the one hand and

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.410
reasoning on the other.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:55.696
And again, I'll leave this slide
for you on the website.

00:23:55.696 --> 00:24:00.307
So what I want to do in the next
part of the lecture, is

00:24:00.307 --> 00:24:04.100
to move from the discussion of
Evans, which in some ways was

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.094
left over from last lecture
though connected to this one,

00:24:07.094 --> 00:24:11.250
and talk a little bit about the
work of Daniel Kahneman

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:15.190
and his collaborator,
Amos Tversky.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.956
So you're now going
to get the second

00:24:16.956 --> 00:24:19.370
chance to use your clickers.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.470
We're only doing one other try
today, and if this one works,

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.600
we'll have a whole slew
next Tuesday.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.812
OK, so this is the famous Asian
disease problem from

00:24:28.812 --> 00:24:31.080
Kahneman and Tversky, and
it runs as follows.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.360
A terrible disease has struck
600 people in your town.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.140
Without treatment, they're
all doomed.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.940
You are the mayor, and
there are two courses

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:46.680
of treatment available.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:52.130
If your last name begins with
the letters A through L,

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:54.816
you're going to need to read the
information that I'm going

00:24:54.816 --> 00:24:55.760
to put in the green box.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.173
So with you head pointing over
to this side, and only read

00:25:00.173 --> 00:25:02.015
what happens in the green box.

00:25:02.015 --> 00:25:06.030
If your last name begins M
through Z, you're going to

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.360
read information in
the blue box.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.576
And let me tell you, we will
use these color conventions

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:13.948
throughout, if this ends up
working, and that the A

00:25:13.948 --> 00:25:18.042
through L group will have only
numbers '1' and '2' for yes

00:25:18.042 --> 00:25:21.162
and no, and the M through Z
group is going to have numbers

00:25:21.162 --> 00:25:23.230
'3' and '4' for yes and no.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.034
So if you're an M through Z-er,
look at the blue, and

00:25:27.034 --> 00:25:30.674
get your fingers ready on three
and four, and if you're

00:25:30.674 --> 00:25:33.245
an A through L-er, look at the
green box and get your fingers

00:25:33.245 --> 00:25:35.710
ready on one and two.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.940
I asked Marvin Chun how to do
slides like this, and this was

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.630
his suggestion.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:41.556
OK.

00:25:41.556 --> 00:25:42.482
So ready?

00:25:42.482 --> 00:25:48.020
I'm going to tell you about plan
A and plan B, so look at

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.010
your side of the board
and not the other.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:51.810
OK?

00:25:51.810 --> 00:26:02.942
So read about plan A. And now
read about plan B. OK.

00:26:02.942 --> 00:26:10.300
Get your clickers out, and if
you are on the green team, use

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:14.457
'1' to indicate if you'd choose
plan A, and '2' to

00:26:14.457 --> 00:26:18.858
indicate that you'd choose plan
B. And if you're on the

00:26:18.858 --> 00:26:25.086
blue team, use '1' to indicate
that you choose plan A and '2'

00:26:25.086 --> 00:26:25.938
to indicate that you

00:26:25.938 --> 00:26:28.156
choose plan B. OK.

00:26:28.156 --> 00:26:29.527
I'm going to put on the timer.

00:26:29.527 --> 00:26:32.660
We want 64 to 66, zillions
and zillions

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:33.850
and zillions of responses.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.860
And let's see how the
numbers come out.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.300
OK.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.310
Here are our numbers.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:43.710
OK.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:51.940
Those of you on the green team,
40% of you chose plan A.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:58.590
Those of you on the blue team,
only 25% of you chose plan A.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.470
Ah, you know what?

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:02.695
This is actually not --

00:27:02.695 --> 00:27:03.140
So.

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.124
We--

00:27:04.124 --> 00:27:07.268
The relevant size of the bar
is relevant but this is

00:27:07.268 --> 00:27:08.470
divided into a 100.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.260
I need to learn a
little bit more

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:11.110
about how to use clickers.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:14.166
So let me now regroup and
make my point again.

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:18.903
As you'll notice, on the green
team, the relative preference

00:27:18.903 --> 00:27:23.740
for plan A exceeded the relative
preference for plan

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:28.486
B. Whereas in the very small
second half of the class,

00:27:28.486 --> 00:27:32.821
which consists of, the problem
is that 60% of you are in A

00:27:32.821 --> 00:27:34.975
through L, and only 40%
of you are M through Z

00:27:34.975 --> 00:27:36.148
(this is our problem).

00:27:36.148 --> 00:27:37.060
OK.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.847
But in this group, if I could
quickly do 26 times 0.4, we

00:27:41.847 --> 00:27:43.735
would be able to find out
what that what absolute

00:27:43.735 --> 00:27:44.510
percentage it was.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.456
In this group, the relative
preference is for plan B

00:27:47.456 --> 00:27:49.920
rather than plan A.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:56.062
Notice, however, that plan A
and plan B are identical.

00:27:56.062 --> 00:27:57.523
There's 600 people.

00:27:57.523 --> 00:28:02.984
And under plan A, 200 people
will live; which means, 400

00:28:02.984 --> 00:28:04.720
people will die.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:09.847
And on this side, there are 600
people; if we go with plan

00:28:09.847 --> 00:28:14.510
A, 400 people will die, which
means it's certain that 200

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:16.775
people will live.

00:28:16.775 --> 00:28:21.692
However, the results which you
all showed are, in fact,

00:28:21.692 --> 00:28:25.485
exactly the typical
set of results.

00:28:25.485 --> 00:28:31.110
Typically, people presented with
a problem that involves a

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:35.850
choice between certainty and
probability framed in terms of

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:40.809
its positive outcomes will go
with the certain rather than

00:28:40.809 --> 00:28:42.760
with risky plan.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.894
Whereas people who, told the
same thing, where they're

00:28:46.894 --> 00:28:52.105
given to focus on the certainty
that 400 people will

00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:59.200
die tend to go with the
probabilistic option.

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:04.182
Notice, again, plan A and
plan B on the two sides

00:29:04.182 --> 00:29:06.623
are exactly the same.

00:29:06.623 --> 00:29:10.712
Just one is framed in terms of
who will live, the other in

00:29:10.712 --> 00:29:12.782
terms of who will die.

00:29:12.782 --> 00:29:17.592
And the result is almost a
complete inversion of people's

00:29:17.592 --> 00:29:19.852
preferences.

00:29:19.852 --> 00:29:24.464
And we get these sorts of
framing effects over and over.

00:29:24.464 --> 00:29:27.507
Here's a study by Kahneman and
Tversky's student, Eldar

00:29:27.507 --> 00:29:30.440
Shafir, from the early 1990s.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.080
You go to an ice cream store,
and you're hoping to get

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.340
yourself two flavors
of ice cream.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.630
One is a good flavor, the other
is an excellent flavor,

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:42.010
but it has high cholesterol.

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.882
And you discover that you only
have enough money to buy one

00:29:46.882 --> 00:29:48.806
of the ice creams.

00:29:48.806 --> 00:29:54.725
So if I asked you which one
would you choose, 28% of

00:29:54.725 --> 00:30:00.231
people choose the good flavor,
and 72% of people choose the

00:30:00.231 --> 00:30:03.920
excellent flavor with
high cholesterol.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:13.454
But if I ask you which one do
you give up, 55% of the people

00:30:13.454 --> 00:30:19.480
give up the one with the good
flavor, and 45% of the people

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:24.552
give up the one with excellent
flavor, high cholesterol.

00:30:24.552 --> 00:30:28.564
So even though, in
this case, 28%--

00:30:28.564 --> 00:30:32.282
even though these are exactly
the same question, which do

00:30:32.282 --> 00:30:32.734
you choose?

00:30:32.734 --> 00:30:36.702
If you choose A, you give up B.
If you choose B, you give

00:30:36.702 --> 00:30:41.190
up A. These numbers
don't match up.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:45.100
When you're asked which one
you choose, the excellent

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:50.130
looms large, and so you go for
it, neglecting the high

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:51.090
cholesterol.

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:53.895
When you're asked which one
you give up, the high

00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:55.720
cholesterol looms larger.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.740
This phenomenon occurs
over and over again.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:07.072
Suppose you're going to a movie,
and when you get to the

00:31:07.072 --> 00:31:10.540
theater, you discover that
you've lost something from

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.370
your wallet.

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:17.840
What you've lost from your
wallet is either a $10 bill or

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.602
a $10 movie ticket which
you had purchased last

00:31:21.602 --> 00:31:23.924
night for the movie.

00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:27.100
You get to the theater, you
open your wallet to go in,

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:29.860
either, in the first case, to
pull out a $10 bill to buy the

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:33.600
ticket, or in the second case,
to pull out your "Admit 1"

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:36.960
ticket to let yourself in, and
you discover that you've lost

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.328
the item that would have
enabled you to

00:31:39.328 --> 00:31:42.256
get into the theater.

00:31:42.256 --> 00:31:46.160
However, you have another $10
bill in your pocket, and the

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:53.005
question is: do you buy
another movie ticket?

00:31:53.005 --> 00:31:55.410
For people who've lost a $10
bill on the way to the movie

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:59.190
theater, 90% of them say, "I
lost a $10 bill, but so what.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:02.620
I'm going to buy a new ticket."
For people who have

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.370
lost a $10 movie ticket which
is of exactly the same value

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:14.050
as a $10 bill, only 42% said
that they would spend the $10

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.660
to buy another ticket.

00:32:18.985 --> 00:32:24.890
So framing is one of the
examples of a heuristic, or

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.966
bias, which Kahneman
and Tversky

00:32:26.966 --> 00:32:30.622
focus on in their work.

00:32:30.622 --> 00:32:34.952
We will return to some other
examples later in the

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:38.062
semester, when we read the
work of Cass Sunstein.

00:32:38.062 --> 00:32:41.400
What I want to point you to now
is a particular example,

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:45.750
which is going to serve as our
segue into the idea of alief.

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:48.380
And that's the distinction
between frequency and

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.751
probability.

00:32:49.751 --> 00:32:53.713
So suppose you're trying to get
a red ball because getting

00:32:53.713 --> 00:32:57.014
a red ball will help
you win a prize.

00:32:57.014 --> 00:33:02.250
And you have a choice about
whether you want to draw from

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:06.732
this box over here, which has
nine white balls and one red

00:33:06.732 --> 00:33:14.235
one, or this box over here,
which has eight red balls and

00:33:14.235 --> 00:33:16.002
92 white ones.

00:33:16.002 --> 00:33:20.560
So here you have a 10% chance,
here you have an 8% chance.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.270
And you're going to be drawing
from the boxes blindfolded.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.710
An image for which I don't
suggest doing Google search.

00:33:32.561 --> 00:33:33.250
So, I found blindfolded
justice.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:34.500
That did a little better.

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.744
All right.

00:33:37.744 --> 00:33:39.580
So you have your choice.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.174
Do you want to let this
box be the one --

00:33:42.174 --> 00:33:44.260
you're trying to get a red ball,
-- do you want to let

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.650
this box be the one, or
do you want to let

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:48.550
this box be the one?

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:53.571
Obviously, rationally, you've
got a better chance over here.

00:33:53.571 --> 00:33:59.525
But people are in fact pulled
in two directions.

00:33:59.525 --> 00:34:03.324
You had a 10% chance over here,
but my goodness, there's

00:34:03.324 --> 00:34:05.080
8 balls over here!

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.960
8 8!

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.840
1 8!

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.720
1 8!

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.130
More!

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:08.540
More!

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.484
More!

00:34:10.484 --> 00:34:14.785
What's going on here, I suggest,
is that whereas you

00:34:14.785 --> 00:34:20.889
have a belief that here, you
have 10% chance, you have what

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:26.058
I call an alief that here there
are eight, whereas over

00:34:26.058 --> 00:34:29.335
there, there is one.

00:34:29.335 --> 00:34:36.140
So alief is a notion that I've
actually discussed on

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:41.840
bloggingheads.tv with
Paul Bloom.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.823
And though we were filming in
different places, here I am in

00:34:45.823 --> 00:34:48.836
the game room at my house with
our geo-puzzles, here's Paul

00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:53.180
in the study, it appears that
we were separated at birth,

00:34:53.180 --> 00:35:00.640
because that's at the same
time as that photo.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:02.550
All right.

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:07.696
So suppose I take you to the
Grand Canyon, and I bring you

00:35:07.696 --> 00:35:12.036
out on the glass walkway that
extends 4,000 feet above the

00:35:12.036 --> 00:35:13.920
roaring river below.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.875
And you step out there
with me, and you

00:35:16.875 --> 00:35:20.022
voluntarily remain there.

00:35:20.022 --> 00:35:23.524
I take it if you voluntarily
remain on a glass surface

00:35:23.524 --> 00:35:27.270
4,000 feet above a roaring
river, you believe that

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.926
surface is safe.

00:35:29.926 --> 00:35:34.950
Nonetheless, I will wager that
most of you would shudder and

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:37.060
shiver and shake.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.568
And you'd do so because you
have what I would call an

00:35:41.568 --> 00:35:46.230
alief that says to you, "I am
4,000 feet in the air, with

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:51.110
nothing holding me here, and
I'm going to tremble."

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.980
Or suppose we're watching a
Western movie -- anybody

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:59.205
recognize that gentleman
who was president

00:35:59.205 --> 00:36:02.015
when you were born?

00:36:02.015 --> 00:36:05.106
When you watch a movie, a
Western movie, and the bullets

00:36:05.106 --> 00:36:07.572
are flying off the stage,
obviously you believe that

00:36:07.572 --> 00:36:08.410
you're safe.

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:12.136
You don't think, "oh, what a
good thing it was that the

00:36:12.136 --> 00:36:14.900
bullets didn't come off
the screen this time".

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:20.770
Nonetheless, particularly
in 3D, you will

00:36:20.770 --> 00:36:22.333
bend your head down.

00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:24.780
If the green slime is coming off
the screen, you'll tremble

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.430
in your seat.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.794
If Anna Karenina is about
to die, you will cry.

00:36:27.794 --> 00:36:31.686
Not because you believe that
you're in danger, but because

00:36:31.686 --> 00:36:33.700
you have an alief.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.660
How many of you set your watch
five minutes fast, and then

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.136
subtract back down?

00:36:40.136 --> 00:36:42.232
When you do it, you believe
that it's ten

00:36:42.232 --> 00:36:43.840
but you have an alief--

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.370
you look down at it --

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:45.720
10:05!

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.775
It enters your visual system ,
it gets processed really fast

00:36:46.775 --> 00:36:49.840
and it says "10:05!

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.704
Hurry!"

00:36:51.704 --> 00:36:56.524
Or suppose you're watching a
rerun of your favorite team on

00:36:56.524 --> 00:37:01.575
television, and you know that if
one of the guys on the team

00:37:01.575 --> 00:37:05.560
tries to steal second, he's
going to be thrown out.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.868
And so you yell at the
television screen, "Don't run!

00:37:09.868 --> 00:37:11.780
Don't run!" Why?

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.348
Because you believe that your
voice is going to go through

00:37:14.348 --> 00:37:20.540
the television screen, back in
time, to first base to reach

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.280
the runner?

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:21.700
No.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:25.095
You have a belief that it's a
rerun, and your alief says

00:37:25.095 --> 00:37:26.656
"don't run".

00:37:26.656 --> 00:37:29.458
Suppose you're on a diet, and
you see this beautiful piece

00:37:29.458 --> 00:37:32.254
of chocolate cake and you have
the belief that it's

00:37:32.254 --> 00:37:33.990
undesirable.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:38.376
Your alief system, in the form
of your Platonic horse may

00:37:38.376 --> 00:37:40.900
nonetheless pull
you towards it.

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:46.228
Suppose I present you with this
delicious cake, those are

00:37:46.228 --> 00:37:50.650
Tootsie rolls, this is a
perfectly clean and sterilized

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:54.252
pan, that's coconut there, in
fact, this one has the same

00:37:54.252 --> 00:37:57.766
ingredients as that
one, exactly.

00:37:57.766 --> 00:37:59.230
You believe me, right?

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.059
I'm your professor, you're
here, listening

00:38:01.059 --> 00:38:01.725
to what I tell you.

00:38:01.725 --> 00:38:03.222
I tell you, this is edible!

00:38:03.222 --> 00:38:05.218
Tootsie rolls, coconut.

00:38:05.218 --> 00:38:07.214
Nonetheless, I take
it that your alief

00:38:07.214 --> 00:38:09.910
system kicks into gear.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.570
Suppose I ask you to sign this
contract: "I hereby assert

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:16.810
that my soul belongs only
to you, O Satan".

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:20.470
And I write at the bottom, "This
is not a legal contract.

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:25.520
It's just a prompt in a
psychology experiment." You

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.694
will, nonetheless, be reluctant
to sign, not because

00:38:27.694 --> 00:38:30.990
you don't believe that this is
a legal contract, right?

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.239
[high-piched voice]

00:38:31.239 --> 00:38:34.103
"Oh my goodness, if I sign my
soul over to the devil, I can

00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:39.390
tell it's the devil--it's
parchment." No.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:42.757
You believe that there's
nothing to it, but

00:38:42.757 --> 00:38:44.320
nonetheless, you hesitate.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:49.660
Suppose I take you to Monica
Bonvicini's bathroom, which

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:54.202
is, as you can see, completely
opaque from the outside.

00:38:54.202 --> 00:38:57.400
You stand outside this public
restroom, you peer into it,

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.660
you see that there's no
way to see inside.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:03.542
You belief is that you are
totally protected.

00:39:03.542 --> 00:39:08.170
Nonetheless, when you go in
to use the facilities,

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:10.100
it looks like that.

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:16.467
And your alief makes it rather
difficult to do what you had

00:39:16.467 --> 00:39:21.440
gone in with the intention
of doing.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:27.997
Suppose we have a bag of sugar
and two glasses of water.

00:39:27.997 --> 00:39:32.578
And you take a spoonful of the
sugar, and you put one in this

00:39:32.578 --> 00:39:36.208
glass and label it "Sugar,"
and one in this glass and

00:39:36.208 --> 00:39:41.660
label it "Poison." You took the
sugar, you put it in the

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.770
glasses, you put the
labels on it.

00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:48.174
Nonetheless, people
are reluctant to

00:39:48.174 --> 00:39:50.214
drink from this glass.

00:39:50.214 --> 00:39:52.630
Moreover, they're not just
reluctant to drink from it

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.940
when it says poison.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.719
They're reluctant to drink from
it when they've written

00:39:56.719 --> 00:39:59.312
the words Not Poison on it.

00:39:59.312 --> 00:39:59.805
Why?

00:39:59.805 --> 00:40:01.284
Because the word poison
is there.

00:40:01.284 --> 00:40:04.100
Running into your
alief system.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:04.670
Good sugar.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.140
Mmm drink sugar.

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:07.355
Poison?

00:40:07.355 --> 00:40:08.000
Poison?

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.933
Don't drink the poison!

00:40:09.933 --> 00:40:11.322
--OK.

00:40:11.322 --> 00:40:17.318
Suppose that I have a kitchen,
and I'm interested in making

00:40:17.318 --> 00:40:19.615
some kitty litter cake,
so I have my cake

00:40:19.615 --> 00:40:22.073
pans stored over here.

00:40:22.073 --> 00:40:26.000
And a chef comes in and says to
me, it would be much more

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.420
efficient if the cake pan
were over on the right.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.230
He's very pleased with
what he's done.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:37.640
And when I ask him to get the
cake pan, he says, "I'm so

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.265
happy that we moved the
muffin tin cake

00:40:40.265 --> 00:40:41.930
to the right cabinet".

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:45.540
And those two get it, believing
it could be on the

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.470
right, exactly where
it used to be.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.550
His belief is that it's
on the right.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:57.180
His alief is a lagging habit.

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:00.357
Any of you who has ever
rearranged your room knows

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:01.010
this feeling.

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:04.778
Any of you who has ever put your
cell phone in your hand,

00:41:04.778 --> 00:41:06.796
and then looked for
your cell phone--

00:41:06.796 --> 00:41:09.524
I've had terrors of having lost
my children, and then

00:41:09.524 --> 00:41:10.856
realized they were
on my shoulder.

00:41:14.326 --> 00:41:19.180
So to have an alief is roughly
to have a representationally

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:24.693
mediated propensity to respond
to an apparent stimulus in a

00:41:24.693 --> 00:41:25.635
particular way.

00:41:25.635 --> 00:41:26.106
Right?

00:41:26.106 --> 00:41:28.990
So the apparent stimulus of
the glass staircase, the

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.860
apparent stimulus of the kitty
litter cake, you have a

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.938
propensity, that's either
innate, as in the case of the

00:41:36.938 --> 00:41:44.145
glass, or the fudge shaped
like feces, or a habitual

00:41:44.145 --> 00:41:47.855
propensity, as when you
arrange the kitchen.

00:41:47.855 --> 00:41:53.540
These are habitual ways of
responding to the world that

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.030
activate the sort of lower-level
systems that we've

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:57.670
been talking about.

00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:01.020
And importantly--although we
can recognize alief most

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:04.606
easily by looking at these kinds
of discordant cases, the

00:42:04.606 --> 00:42:08.230
cases where belief tells you
to do one thing, and alief

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:09.815
tells you to do the other.

00:42:09.815 --> 00:42:15.050
In fact, alief is active
all the time.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.740
Every time I've used my right
thumb to push the key on this,

00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:22.420
I've done it out of alief.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.920
Fortunately, it's one that
corresponds with what I intend

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:30.986
to do, but it is certainly
the case that an enormous

00:42:30.986 --> 00:42:36.668
proportion of our actions
are governed by alief.

00:42:36.668 --> 00:42:38.917
The question is this.

00:42:38.917 --> 00:42:43.370
Given that I just showed you
that there are hundreds and

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:48.078
hundreds of ways of describing
what I adverted to with the

00:42:48.078 --> 00:42:54.050
notion of alief, why introduce
this new term?

00:42:57.412 --> 00:43:02.260
The story has something to
do with alief itself.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:07.850
So every 20 years or so, the
United States government

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.320
introduces a dollar coin.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.870
Here's the one they introduced
in 1921.

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:16.253
Here's the one they introduced
in 1972.

00:43:16.253 --> 00:43:20.940
Here's the one they introduced
later in the 1980s.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:22.965
Here's the one they introduced
in 1980,

00:43:22.965 --> 00:43:24.551
with Susan B. Anthony.

00:43:24.551 --> 00:43:29.160
Here's the Sacajawea one they
introduced in 2003, and in a

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.840
massive fit of public relations
genius, here's the

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:38.410
Millard Fillmore golden coin,
which will be issued soon.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.400
What's going on here?

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.340
What's going on here is that
it's hard to get people to

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:49.190
make use of something if it
doesn't fit into the currency

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:53.250
system which they
have already.

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:57.730
Dollar coins don't fit naturally
into the ways that

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:02.260
Americans use money.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:07.135
Likewise, talk of system one,
system two, relatively

00:44:07.135 --> 00:44:12.485
autonomous systems, heuristics
biases and so on, don't fit

00:44:12.485 --> 00:44:16.290
naturally into the way
that we have of

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.486
talking about ourselves.

00:44:18.486 --> 00:44:23.260
We talk about ourselves in terms
of beliefs and desires.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:29.680
And in order to make use of
the gold coin that is the

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:34.320
recognition of the multipartite
soul, we need a

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.280
notion that fits into our
conceptual currency.

00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:44.280
And that's the role that my
hope is alief will play.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.364
So alief is going to return
to us in later lectures.

00:44:48.364 --> 00:44:51.598
We'll hear about it again in the
context of the harmony of

00:44:51.598 --> 00:44:54.760
the soul and in other domains,
we'll hear about heuristic and

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.630
biases and we'll hear about
the multipart soul.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:01.483
I look forward to seeing all of
you on Tuesday for harmony

00:45:01.483 --> 00:45:02.733
and happiness.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.710
- So, in the interests of, again,

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.260
both taking some people down memory lane

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.200
and recreating where we're coming from

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.820
for those who are too young
to have experienced it,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.710
let's go back to August 19

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.463
of 1991 in Moscow.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.610
- [Reporter] Mingling with
the rush hour traffic,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.860
Red Army armored personnel carriers

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.040
on the streets of Moscow this morning,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.750
heading to the Kremlin.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.900
They first moved in at four a.m.,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.900
the first sign of the coup d'etat

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.223
that removed Mikhail Gorbachev from power.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.960
With tanks in Red
Square, the official word

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.790
from the new government calling itself

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.720
the National Emergency Committee,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.770
was that the architect of
glasnost and perestroika

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.240
was too ill to continue in office.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.570
A short statement reminiscent
of the Soviet Union's past

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.763
was broadcast by state television.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960
- [Reporter] By mid-morning
APCs were ringing

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.950
the Defense Ministry and
most government buildings.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.440
For many people on the streets,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.863
the reaction was one of sheer
surprise and resignation.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.380
- So that was a pretty dramatic
moment in August of 1991.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.270
And the coup of course
was being prosecuted

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.780
against Mikhail Gorbachev,
who had come to power

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.193
as the head of the Soviet Union in 1985.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.220
Leonid Brezhnev had been General Secretary

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.380
of the Communist Party
for a number of decades

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.647
after Khrushchev, but he died in 1982

00:02:18.647 --> 00:02:23.647
and it was an aging
Politburo, and he was replaced

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.060
in quick succession by
two transitional figures,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.310
one of whom died after 14 months,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.840
and the other who died after 11 months.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.140
And so when Gorbachev came to power

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.890
in February of 1985

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.000
there was a lot of head-scratching
going on in the West

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.460
as to what would become
of the Soviet Union.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.800
And he rapidly transfixed

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.440
people both at home in Russia,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.860
as the Soviet Union as
it then was, and abroad.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.810
He seemed to be a different
kind of politician,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.940
he was extremely charismatic.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.563
He was much younger.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.410
He could talk and behave
like a Western politician

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.720
and he quickly went on a
kind of charm offensive

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.093
around the world.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.390
He developed a strong
rapport with Ronald Reagan

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.060
which led to arms reduction
talks in Reykjavik

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.310
and he began the processes
of what he called

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.900
perestroika and glasnost.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.300
Perestroika is Russian for restructuring,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.820
and he planned fundamental restructuring

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.200
of the Soviet economy.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.710
He had become convinced
that the old command system

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.140
didn't work and had to be reformed.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.700
Glasnost was basically free speech,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.700
that they began opening up
the state controlled media,

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.290
they started creating much less,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.940
much more access to
different media outlets.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.190
They allowed criticism of the regime

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.490
that had been unthinkable until that time.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.823
And it seemed like,

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:20.970
it seemed like the Soviet Union

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.560
was really beginning to change,
and then of course in 1989,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.730
when the revolutions happened
across Eastern Europe

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.960
that I talked about last time,
the Soviet Union did nothing.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.360
They didn't intervene as they
had previously intervened

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.410
in Hungary, they did
not do anything to stop

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.020
the departure of the
East European countries

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.140
from the Soviet Bloc,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.370
and the transitions that were by then

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.833
would soon be getting underway.

00:04:56.396 --> 00:05:00.660
And Gorbachev was seen
as this radical reformer.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.670
He was a reformer, he
was not a revolutionary,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.930
and he thought that he could

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.930
adjust the Soviet system in a
gradual way to some new order.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.380
But as he did that, of course
he ran into a lot of push-back

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.780
from vested interests,
from communist ideologues

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.283
who didn't want change.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.460
And he was fighting a
battle, both against them,

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.630
and as we'll see in a moment,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.630
against reformers who thought
that he was going too slowly.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:40.340
In any event, in the summer of 1999,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.340
1991, the hardliners
clearly had the upper hand

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.470
and they locked him up in his dacha

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.470
on the evening of August 18th,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.370
and that was the coup

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.367
that appeared to be well
underway by the next day.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.020
But things were not so simple,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.890
and history was gonna play
out a little differently.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.710
So this is what happened

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.473
a few minutes later.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.780
- [Reporter] Tanks were
also positioned outside

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.180
the Russian parliament building,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.555
Boris Yeltsin's headquarters.

00:06:24.555 --> 00:06:28.000
- [Crowd] Yeltsin, Yeltsin, Yeltsin.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.420
- [Reporter] The democratically
elected President of Russia

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.250
was soon striding out of the building

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.360
to address a crowd of supporters.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.620
His own radio and television
stations by now occupied

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.210
and forced off the air, he climbed aboard

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.240
one of the Red Army's own tanks,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.463
and said the coup leaders had
disgraced the Soviet Union.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.747
(crowd applauding)

00:07:22.808 --> 00:07:24.270
- [Reporter] And he went
further, calling for

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.253
civic resistance to the
hard-line grab of power.

00:07:35.956 --> 00:07:39.956
(crowd shouting and applauding)

00:07:47.306 --> 00:07:50.930
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.460
- [Reporter] Yeltsin's supporters reacted

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.324
with their bare hands,
building makeshift barricades

00:07:55.324 --> 00:07:57.500
with whatever piece of disused machinery

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.400
or brickwork was available.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.780
And one crane driver joined the effort,

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.200
shifting concrete blocks to
the delight of the crowd,

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.780
helping build the obstacles
designed to prevent

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.690
any army attempt to seize
the parliament building.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.090
No attempt was made.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.430
One army commander loyal to Boris Yeltsin,

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.143
Colonel Konstantin Kobets,
tried to reassure the crowd.

00:08:36.872 --> 00:08:38.910
(crowd shouting and applauding)

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:41.150
- And that of course was a decisive moment

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.260
because it indicated that the military

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.510
was not supporting the coup.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:50.510
And that instead they were
gonna be loyal to Boris Yeltsin.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.380
Now Yeltsin had himself been a
traditional Soviet politician

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.670
in the 1970s and 1980s

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.670
and had initially been a
supporter of Gorbachev's reforms.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.420
But he actually was on the

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.390
more radical side of the Communist Party,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.210
at least at that time,

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.040
in thinking that the
reforms had to go faster

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.100
and had to go, be more extensive.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.180
And he in fact got so
frustrated that he did something

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.020
that at that time in 1987

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.320
was unprecedented in the
history of the Soviet Union,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:35.320
he resigned from the Politburo
of the Communist Party.

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.300
And nobody had ever done that before,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.110
there was consternation and
it was sort of covered up

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.390
in that in the end Gorbachev fired him

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.540
and there was then

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.603
some pretty significant
conflict between them.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.610
It is said that in the
midst of all of this

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:05.983
Yeltsin actually tried to
commit suicide at one point.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.980
And in any event he
left the Communist Party

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.930
and started to reconstitute
himself as a Russian politician

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.250
and eventually would run for the,

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.523
to be a member of the Russian parliament.

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.600
He had done that and in fact in June,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.830
in June of 1991, so we're talking about

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:39.580
three months before the coup attempt

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.653
he had been elected President
of the Russian parliament.

00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:47.600
And where they were

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.330
in this video outside the White House,

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.930
that was the building of
the Russian parliament,

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.270
as distinct from the Soviet
government buildings,

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.980
which we all know about, the
Kremlin opposite Red Square.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.620
And so it was Yeltsin who stood up

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.950
and faced down the coup
plotters while Gorbachev was

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:13.543
in his dacha locked up on the Black Sea.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.380
And then the military
decided to get behind him,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.043
and the next day you can
see Gorbachev returning.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.200
- [Reporter] A president returns to power.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.960
Mikhail Gorbachev, flying into
Moscow after being detained

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.940
for three days on the
orders of some of the men

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.400
he appointed to senior positions
within his own government.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.390
Their attempted coup d'etat crushed,

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.840
he said tonight it was business
as usually at the Kremlin,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.880
and despite the treachery of
many of its senior figures,

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.383
he wouldn't be leaving
the Communist Party.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.470
- Gorbachev said tonight
he'd made mistakes

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.090
by putting his trust in men
who would try to topple him.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.760
Many here now believe he's
making another mistake

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.720
by staying within a Communist Party

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.850
that's so widely discredited
after the events of this week.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.810
For World Monitor, I'm
Simon Marks in Moscow.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.500
- So this was in fact the moment
when the real power passed

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.440
from Gorbachev to Yeltsin,
as you'll see in a minute

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.270
because Gorbachev couldn't
detach himself from the idea

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.140
that there had to be a
gradual guided transition

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.060
under the auspices of the Communist Party

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.450
of the Soviet Union.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.992
And Yeltsin seized the moment
and this is how it played out.

00:12:54.992 --> 00:12:58.825
(crowd shouting and chanting)

00:13:03.528 --> 00:13:06.282
- [Reporter] A president gets the cheers.

00:13:06.282 --> 00:13:08.840
He used the occasion to
call for increased power

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:10.420
for the Russian government

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.883
and thanked his people for staying loyal.

00:13:26.754 --> 00:13:29.921
(audience applauding)

00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:33.130
- [Reporter] Present at
the rally, many of the men

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.690
who once served with Mikhail Gorbachev.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.270
Economic advisor Stanislav Shatalin,

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:41.410
and former Foreign Minster
Eduard Shevardnadze.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.670
The men who helped mold glasnost

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.400
now siding with the man of the hour.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.600
The Mayor of Moscow, Gavriil Popov,

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.400
said to regain the
support of the democrats,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.280
Gorbachev had to break
with the Communist Party

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.010
and recognize its seven decades
in power were at an end.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:01.220
Joining the celebrations,
Gorbachev's former press spokesman

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:03.520
Sergei Grigoriev and his wife.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.740
After three nights on the
barricades, he says his old boss

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.540
faces a fight to take the
political high ground.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:14.540
- But I think that he will
have to define his attitude

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.640
and to elaborate his
position very quickly,

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.040
otherwise, his days in
power might be counted.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:21.840
You can see judging by the rally

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.500
and by the attitude of the people,

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:27.583
that the democratic movement
is actually gaining strength.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.930
- [Reporter] At the end of the rally,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.900
the Russian flag was hoisted
above the parliament building

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.010
in place of the hammer and sickle.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:37.993
Ships on the River Moskva
blew an audible salute.

00:14:41.877 --> 00:14:46.830
(crowd chanting in foreign language)

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.690
Within an hour the crowd was heading

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:52.820
to the seat of Soviet power,
Red Square and the Kremlin.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.820
A tide of people bringing with them

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.350
the banner of independence,
a huge Russian flag,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.113
and shots of down with
the Communist Party.

00:15:02.144 --> 00:15:04.894
(crowd chanting)

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:10.020
The young guards on duty
at Lenin's mausoleum

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.173
looked as if they were about to be mobbed.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:20.730
When the time came to change the guard

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:24.130
the normally solemn ceremony
was derided by the crowd,

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:26.923
a Communist shrine now openly mocked.

00:15:37.652 --> 00:15:40.485
(crowd whistling)

00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:46.095
(crowd shouting)

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.230
From Red Square they moved on.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.490
Next stop, KGB headquarters

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:57.480
and the statue in front of
it of Felix Dzerzhinsky,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.590
the man who founded the secret
police here in the 1920s.

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.790
Yeltsin's spokesman promised them a crane

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.140
would be brought in to bring
the monument to the ground.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.140
Former Gorbachev supporters
say the Russian president

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.760
now has a better feel
for the popular sentiment

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.700
than the leader in the Kremlin.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.820
- I think that with his
democratic instincts

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:22.100
and his feel what the people
want, and what the people need,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.960
he is really turning
himself into man number one

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.170
in the Soviet Union in terms of popularity

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.616
and in terms of appeal to the mass.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:35.616
(crowd cheering and applauding)

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.640
- So that was the dramatic four days

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:02.640
that were really the denouement
of the old Soviet order.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:07.022
Today, our agenda is gonna be five-fold.

00:17:07.022 --> 00:17:10.950
We're gonna talk about why
the Soviet Union collapsed,

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.360
but only somewhat briefly.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.210
We're then gonna talk about
the more interesting puzzle

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.783
which is why it collapsed so peacefully.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:24.700
Why basically one of the
two superpowers in the world

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.953
folded up and just died.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:31.960
We're then gonna focus on the
rise of gangster capitalism,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.980
the title of today's lecture.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:39.070
We're going to turn to the
transition from Yeltsin,

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.750
who governed throughout the 1990s,

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.630
he gave up power to his hand-picked deputy

00:17:49.044 --> 00:17:52.190
Putin on the first day
of the new millennium.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:57.190
He resigned effectively
December 31st, 1999

00:17:57.220 --> 00:18:02.220
and Vladimir Putin has
been in control of Russia

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.753
in one role or another ever since.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.930
And then lastly we're
gonna focus on the question

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:14.650
why is Russia so corrupt,
and what lessons can we draw

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:17.630
from the fact of its corruption.

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.000
So that's what we'll do.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.670
Just to review the events

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.620
that led up to those four days in August.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.770
In May 12th, the Baltic states,

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:32.780
echoing an old agreement from 1934,

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.580
having watched six months earlier

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:38.580
the wall come down in Germany,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.430
signed an entente that indicated

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.710
they were planning to secede
from the Soviet Union.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.840
In June of that year the
Congress of People's Deputies

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.620
in Russia, that is where

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.040
Yeltsin was run initially

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.660
as a deputy and then become president,

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.863
declared that it was sovereign
over Russia's territory.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.447
In March of 1991

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.740
a referendum was held on whether or not

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.720
to keep the Soviet Union together,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.720
and there was high turnout and
a strong majority saying yes,

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:19.410
although there were
boycotts from the Baltics

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:24.280
and four or five other Soviet republics

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.313
that didn't participate in the referendum.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.790
June of that year,

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:35.010
exactly a year after
the Russian parliament,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.450
Congress of People's Deputies
had declared itself sovereign,

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:42.030
Boris Yeltsin had been
elected as its president.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:45.880
We then had the four day
attempted coup in August

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.410
as we've just witnessed.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.973
In the midst of that coup I should say,

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.520
the day before it was finally over,

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.840
Estonia and Latvia had already
declared their independence.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.740
The coup was then defeated.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.963
Ukraine held a referendum
and voted to secede,

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:11.640
and then Yeltsin met with the
Ukrainian president secretly

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.930
and agreed that the Soviet
Union no longer existed.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:20.930
Gorbachev was still chasing
the horse out of the barn

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.470
that had long since left him behind,

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:28.470
he declared the agreement
illegal and dangerous.

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.660
But in December leaders of
the 11 remaining republic

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:39.260
met in Alma Ata, now know
as Almaty, in Kazakhstan

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.960
to essentially declare
the Soviet Union dead

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.110
and constitute the CIS,

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.900
the Confederation of Independent States.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.520
At that point Gorbachev
realized he had no choice,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.680
and he resigned on what we
think of as Christmas Day,

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.820
but not Christmas Day in
Russia, which comes later,

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:03.720
and at the end of the month

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.283
the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.963
So why did the Soviet Union collapse?

00:21:16.157 --> 00:21:17.283
Any thoughts?

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:23.200
What's the first thing that
comes to somebody's mind

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.313
when we ask, why did the
Soviet Union collapse?

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.640
- [Student] Arms race.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.530
- There was an arms race.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.080
And why would that have, we'd
had plenty of arms races.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:38.810
We had arms races all
through the Cold War,

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.063
so it certainly contributed,
but why else, yeah.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:45.610
- [Student] My parents
remember how they were waiting

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:49.322
to buy sausages, like in the market.

00:21:49.322 --> 00:21:51.680
You couldn't buy jeans.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.610
- The shops were empty, you
couldn't buy anything, right,

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.640
you couldn't buy anything,

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.930
the GUM department store in Moscow,

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:02.930
which is the biggest department
store right off Red Square.

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.390
Sort of six or seven store
department store, was empty.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.410
There was nothing in it.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.560
You could buy things,
there was a black market,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.190
you could buy things to some
extent on the black market,

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:17.380
but there's a hugely
inefficient command system

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.500
that had basically ceased to function.

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.600
And the Soviet Union

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.600
was dependent on this system

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:31.300
but the great difficulty
with a command economy,

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.760
and we'll talk about this
more next week in relation to

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.020
some of the other former
communist systems,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.920
is that the people making the decisions

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.830
have very bad access to
reliable information.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.240
Prices are set by decree,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.243
not in response to supply and demand.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.240
There are very poor incentives to work.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.940
And so the unsustainable economy

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:04.223
had become steadily more unsustainable.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:10.030
So that's one part of it, but
then I want to come back to

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:13.950
the gentleman who mentioned the arms race.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.340
The other reason is
that containment worked.

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.290
Now containment had been
the policy dreamed up

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:22.550
by George Kennan, who

00:23:23.849 --> 00:23:26.280
had been a US Ambassador to Russia

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.570
and eventually became the first head

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.300
of the Policy Planning Staff,

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.500
it was an office that was created for him

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.760
in the Truman administration.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.593
And

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:43.807
he was one of the first
people, this is in the 1940s,

00:23:43.807 --> 00:23:46.550
he had been one of the first people to say

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.430
the Soviet system is unsustainable,

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.860
it's got a dysfunctional economy at home,

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.950
and its international ambitions are such

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.220
that it's going to pursue,

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.750
it's gonna pursue foreign adventures

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:06.750
that eventually it's not
gonna be able to finance.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.600
And so all we have to do is contain it.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.480
We don't need to go to war with them,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.300
we just have to contain them,

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:16.163
prevent their expansion, and wait.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:20.620
And he had, there were
various disagreements

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.810
about what containment
meant, we'll talk next week,

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:27.630
for instance he was opposed
to forming NATO even,

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:31.870
which he thought would
unnecessarily militarize

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.790
the conflict with the Soviet Union

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.060
and eventually he resigned
from the government

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.860
and went off in a huff to Princeton.

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.330
But very largely,

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:46.330
the US in Europe did follow
the policy of containment.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.870
What changed in the 1980s was two things,

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.900
which increased the fiscal pressure

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.280
on the already pressured,

00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:00.230
highly pressured Soviet system.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.970
One was that they got involved

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.180
in a quagmire war in Afghanistan.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.443
They invaded Afghanistan in 1979,

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.850
having failed to learn from
the examples of the British

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.580
and others who had tried to
invade Afghanistan in the past,

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:19.883
a very difficult country to
invade given the terrain.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.940
They spent the entire 1980s

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.620
embroiled in this war in Afghanistan.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.200
It was their fear of

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.580
the rise of Islamic fundamentalism,

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:40.580
which they thought would
infect the other Asiatic,

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.410
would start to infect
the Asiatic republics

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:48.580
of the Soviet Union, and so
they were very nervous about it.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.320
And it was a huge fiscal
drain, a failed war.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.653
It was the Soviet Union's
version of our Vietnam War.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.780
And then secondly, when
Ronald Reagan came into office

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.560
he announced Star Wars,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.560
which increased the cost of
the arms race to the Soviets.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.530
By an enormous amount.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:15.480
So these were the reasons
why the Soviet Union

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.303
eventually just creaked and fell apart.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.250
We could spend the entire
lecture unpacking them,

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.793
but we're not, this is not
a course about the Cold War.

00:26:27.347 --> 00:26:30.060
What I want to put our attention on

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.340
is why was the collapse so peaceful.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.120
You know, you would think if
somebody shoots an elephant

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.520
it's gonna stumble around
and do an awful lot of damage

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.980
before it finally collapses.

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:47.740
This elephant basically
just knelt down and died.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.733
And that's quite remarkable.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:55.570
Any thoughts or intuitions about why

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.503
it ended with a whimper
rather than a bang?

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.309
Yep.

00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:05.310
- [Student] There was
a sense of desperation

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.450
throughout the entire population,

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:11.450
whether it was waiting in lines
for any store, any product,

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.780
or being overly

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:17.630
bunched up in housing.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:21.420
The lack of jobs and
the lack of innovation

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.783
made the people very
desperate and depressed.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.020
- People were desperate and afraid,

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.780
but my real question is about the elites.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:36.100
Why did the elites give up power

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.980
that they had guarded so
jealously for such a long time.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.450
And after all there are
many authoritarian systems

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.460
in the world where there are
angry, desperate populations

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.570
and the elite clings to power

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.210
and just becomes more and more repressive.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.120
Yeah.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.080
- [Student] I think they had
prepared themselves for this

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.600
having looked at what happened in Berlin,

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.250
they had already started
making sure that if this came

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.030
that their interests would be protected.

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.240
- Who would be protected?

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.110
- [Student] That the elites--

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:05.710
- Okay, that's part of it.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:09.520
So that the elites, just
to repeat the comment

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.090
in case some didn't hear it.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:16.130
The elites were looking
for and seem to have found

00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:19.640
ways to protect themselves
through the collapse.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.620
So what I'm gonna do here is introduce

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.620
an analytical schema
from the social sciences,

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.810
this is actually from a famous economist,

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:34.140
a development economist by
the name of Albert Hirschman

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.650
who published this book "Exit,
Voice, and Loyalty" in 1970.

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.650
And he developed a
framework for thinking about

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:48.340
what happens when, as you
can tell from the subtitle,

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.680
firms, organizations, states, decline.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.440
How do people respond to decline.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.780
And the framework he developed I think is,

00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:00.680
I think this is, if you read no other book

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.500
in the social sciences
before you graduate,

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.530
or this is certainly one
of the two or three books

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.170
you should definitely read.

00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.650
And we will use Hirschman's framework

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.430
at various points in the course.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.000
And so what is, he said, well

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:21.270
if you think about yourself
if a declining organization,

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:22.970
there are three things you can do.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.283
One is, you can leave, exit.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:34.270
Two is you can complain and
try and get it changed, voice.

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:37.380
Three, you can try to fix it yourself.

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.370
You believe in the cause and
you want to make it better.

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:47.340
And a lot of Hirschman's
analysis says that

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:51.920
what mix of exit, voice,
and loyalty people engage in

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.730
is determined by the
costs of those things.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:58.403
So for instance, if you
think about a public company.

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:02.680
If you're a shareholder
in a public company

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.070
and you don't like the way it's being run,

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:06.470
you can just sell your shares

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.430
and buy shares in a different company

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.050
that you like better, right?

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:13.330
So you don't have much incentive to

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:17.380
go to shareholders meetings
and trying to get the company,

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.450
you maybe think it's got
too much debt or something,

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.860
you just buy shares in a
company that has less debt.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.430
That's all you need to do, just
exit, very low cost of exit.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.600
So people are not gonna engage in voice.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.870
Now of course you might
care about the company,

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.490
it might be ostensibly a green company

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.330
and you might be holding
the shares in the company

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.730
because of your commitment
to green energy.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.990
Then you might feel loyalty to the company

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.823
and you will want to
try and get it changed.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:52.810
Think about yourself as a
worker, working for a company.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:56.900
If you don't like the way
the company is being run

00:30:56.900 --> 00:31:00.380
unlike a shareholder you
can't just pick up and leave,

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.590
you've got, you know,
you live in this town,

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.600
you've got your family,

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.920
your kids are in the schools and so forth.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.810
The costs of exit for you are very high.

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.890
So you're more likely to engage in voice,

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:13.060
you're gonna go to meetings,
you're gonna complain,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.300
you might form a union.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.410
You're gonna do things, or join a union.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.630
You're gonna do things to get the company

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.600
to change its ways.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.910
So his book is an analysis
of the ways in which

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.370
exit, voice, and loyalty
might be complementary

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.920
in some circumstances,

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.030
and might be competitors
in some circumstances

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:39.050
for the ways in which people respond

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:43.050
to the decline of organizations.

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:48.020
So the first thing to say
about the Soviet Union

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:54.010
in the 1980s and '90s is there
was a substantial decline,

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:57.490
almost disappearance of loyalty

00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:00.750
among both the elites and the citizens.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:05.750
And I got a firsthand view
of this in March of 1991.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.860
There was a Yale delegate
invited by the Communist Party

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:14.020
of the Soviet Union to
a conference in Moscow,

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.290
actually the week before the referendum

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:19.850
that I mentioned to you earlier.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:23.660
And we had been impressed
by Gorbachev and so forth,

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.530
but we didn't really have
much knowledge about,

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.720
I certainly was no expert
on the Soviet Union,

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:31.850
and most of the other people
in the delegation were not,

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.820
and we had this stereotypical picture

00:32:37.077 --> 00:32:42.077
of the KGB shadowing us around
and telling us what to do.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.230
And we needed to be careful and so on.

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:50.870
And the first thing we noticed
was widespread evidence

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.870
of brazen corruption.

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:55.250
I'll give you just two examples.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.880
We are all afraid of what the KGB people

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.080
might be doing to us, the
first KGB person I ran into

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.880
was trying to sell me currency

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.263
at black market exchange rates.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:12.710
And then secondly I
went to a reception, and

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.970
somebody came up to me with a translator

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:20.450
and the translator said this
gentleman wants to speak to you

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.427
and he said, "Professor Shapiro,

00:33:22.427 --> 00:33:24.470
"I understand you're a South African."

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:29.113
This is 1991, okay, it's before
the collapse of apartheid,

00:33:30.964 --> 00:33:33.390
it's the beginning of
the collapse of apartheid

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.480
in South Africa,

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.820
Mandela is being released
from prison and so forth.

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:41.410
But the apartheid regime was still there

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:44.310
and it was not clear how
it was gonna play out.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:48.350
And so this person speaks
in Russian, which I don't,

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.100
I speak a little bit now
but I spoke none then,

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.360
and basically the translator says,

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.150
this gentleman wants to know how to make,

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:02.150
if you can facilitate
this making a connection

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.440
with the government of
South Africa because

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.220
he has access to weapons

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.850
which he would like to sell to them.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.560
And we regard apartheid
as a domestic matter,

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.670
we don't care what's
going on in the country,

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.540
but I can sell all kinds of weapons,

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.023
including nuclear weapons.

00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:27.650
Which might have been
nonsense, but this is quite,

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.790
actually South Africa's
one of the few countries

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:34.030
that had actually given up
its nuclear arsenal as the,

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:36.330
that's another story
which we'll get to later,

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:41.330
but so I was stunned by this and I said,

00:34:42.197 --> 00:34:46.367
"I think maybe you mis-translated
what he was saying to me,

00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:48.710
"could you ask him to say it again?"

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:51.670
And he said it again,
exactly the same thing.

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.703
And so I said very nice
to meet you and goodbye.

00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:01.170
So that was, this was,
the levels of brazen,

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.910
you know, it wasn't,
nobody was trying to hide

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.020
what they were doing, it
was completely public,

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.163
this is in March of 1991.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:14.484
We then had a meeting with Vadin Zagladin,

00:35:14.484 --> 00:35:17.430
a politburo member

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.130
and he was at that time

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:24.510
essentially the secretary
of state for Europe.

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:28.380
And he gave a speech,

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.560
and he said we have concluded
that the Soviet system

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.963
is unsustainable,

00:35:36.063 --> 00:35:39.460
it's got to be replaced
from top to bottom.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:42.083
And we were stunned by this.

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:46.100
That a leading official in the Politburo

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.710
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.720
was essentially saying
the system is bankrupt.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.820
He gave a speech and
we went around the room

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.560
and it was clear it was
the kind of situation

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.670
where you're only gonna get one question,

00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:03.000
so you better think about
what the right question is.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.387
So when it came to my turn,
I said, "Mr. Zagladin,

00:36:07.387 --> 00:36:10.917
"when did you conclude
that the Soviet Union

00:36:10.917 --> 00:36:12.490
"was unsustainable?"

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.747
And he didn't blink, he said, "1978".

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.017
He said, "I was in a
Young Communist League

00:36:19.017 --> 00:36:23.427
"actually with Gorbachev and
there was a whole cohort of us

00:36:23.427 --> 00:36:28.000
"who concluded that the Soviet
Union was unsustainable."

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.620
So here you had a country
led by a cadre of elites

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.670
who didn't believe in the
public ideology of the country.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:38.000
And so of course they had no loyalty

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:41.350
to the public ideology of the country,

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:44.540
it simply had dissipated.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.380
And then

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.930
some of our hosts invited us

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:53.670
to meet with various radical,
more radical factions

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.950
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.570
who were more like activists and so on,

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:02.430
and by then we'd been
there for about a week

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.800
and we thought, you know,
we were getting some grip

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.670
on this situation, so I
met with this group of,

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:12.420
they were members of the Communist Party,

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.520
political activists and I
had the temerity to say,

00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.480
well wouldn't it maybe a good
idea to transform this economy

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.763
in an ordered and gradual fashion.

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.490
And they started screaming at me,

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.250
calling me a Stalinist and a reactionary,

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.980
and so it was just, these are
just three pieces of evidence

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:38.010
but everywhere you went,

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:41.840
there was nobody who was defending

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.170
the idea that, you know,
whatever the sorts of,

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.240
nobody had the sort of attitude

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.550
that Gorbachev was expressing
in that final video

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:54.210
where he said, I am a loyal
member of the Communist Party

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:58.080
and we have to fix it, even
though it had turned on him.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:02.880
So in terms of loyalty,
Hirschman's category of loyalty,

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:07.873
by 1991, loyalty was
pretty thin on the ground.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:14.353
But let's think about exit.

00:38:15.814 --> 00:38:20.814
Exit in some ways turns out
to be even more interesting.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.830
So

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.780
as I said with the example
of a company you don't like,

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.370
you can just sell the stock.

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:34.270
If the costs of exit are low
and you don't have any loyalty

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:39.080
why waste your time trying
to change an organization?

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.080
And so what was it that
reduced the costs of exit?

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:48.160
So there were some
fortuitous political things.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.820
So if you think about I already mentioned,

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.900
Boris Yeltsin had been a
member of the Soviet hierarchy

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:59.900
for much of his career,
but he had the opportunity

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:03.020
to go off and be in the Russian Federation

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:07.200
and eventually become President
of the Russian Federation.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:09.800
Eduard Shevardnadze who had
been the Foreign Minister

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.640
of the Soviet Union
could go off and become

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:15.630
President of Georgia, which he did.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.180
So there were places
for these people to go,

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.950
and these of course are
the high visibility people,

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.760
but many of the lower visibility people

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.420
in their entourages and
so on, could go with them.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:32.210
So there were opportunities
for political exit

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.050
for the leading figures
and subordinate figures

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:41.730
in many of the figures
of the Soviet hierarchy.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:44.300
But what I want to spend more time is that

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:48.203
the economic costs of
leaving, of giving up,

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.290
had reduced, had come down.

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:55.730
And this leads us into the discussion

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.770
of the rise of the oligarchs.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.283
The rise of gangster capitalism.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.130
So where did the oligarchs come from?

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.453
They came from a variety of places.

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.750
Just to mention some.

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:18.750
One was the dynamics
of the collapse itself.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.820
This is described in Karen Dewisha's book,

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.050
the first chapter of Karen Dewisha's book,

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.660
which I put on the syllabus.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.790
During the late 1980s

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.540
as things were getting
more and more extreme

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:37.393
in terms of the fiscal pressure
on the Soviet government,

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.730
various ministries including the KGB

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:44.260
started shifting a lot of money offshore

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:49.260
and putting hard currency in
bank accounts in Western banks.

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:52.710
And some of the motivation for this

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.040
was from loyalists actually.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.440
They thought Soviet
Union's gonna collapse,

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.650
we want to be able to
live to fight another day,

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.170
they sort of saw themselves
as like, you know,

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.260
the latter-day version of the
French Resistance if you like,

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.323
and they were gonna need resources.

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:12.940
But others maybe have
had different motives.

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.830
But what happened in the
August 1991 coup attempt

00:41:18.766 --> 00:41:20.960
was that the Soviet

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.520
bureaucracy disappeared.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.070
And suddenly there were
all kinds of people

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.900
who found themselves with the control

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.230
over these bank accounts,

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.330
and they were now completely unsupervised.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:40.730
And so one relatively small,
but not inconsequential,

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:45.600
source of money from
former Soviet officials

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.660
was the money in these
offshore bank accounts.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:52.423
And some people decided to,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.160
to make off with it.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:01.830
And that money resurfaced
later, at later times.

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:05.570
But by far the bigger source

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:10.570
of oligarchs was essentially
the theft of state assets.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.263
And so here for example,

00:42:16.253 --> 00:42:20.550
a gentleman by the name of Rem Vyakhirev,

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:23.560
who had also been a Soviet apparatchik,

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.020
he'd been the Deputy Minister for

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:29.510
oil and gas

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.800
in the last years of the Soviet Union.

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.020
He was put in charge of Gazprom,

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:39.020
which is a large state venture

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:43.223
controlling gas in the Soviet Union.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:47.550
But what did he do with
this power that he had?

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.640
He essentially started

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.620
giving away

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.200
large amounts of its assets
to friends and relatives

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.610
through various schemes.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:42:59.663
So they would,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.210
they would essentially

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:10.100
let friends and relatives buy
gas at below market prices

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.480
and then sell it and pocket difference.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:16.930
And they even did this with
large numbers of gas fields.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:18.890
And so we started to see

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:23.740
the emergence of people
making huge amounts of money

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.300
from these dirty transactions.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.810
And essentially the
looting of state assets

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:36.080
by people who were put in charge of them.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.140
So somebody like Vyakhirev

00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:44.900
was able to do this because
he was strategically placed

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.853
in order to be able to facilitate it.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.550
But a second, a third if you like,

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:55.030
source of oligarchical power

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.390
was derived from the fact that

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.690
Russia had inherited

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:06.450
a weak and bankrupt state.

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:09.270
And I want to say a little
bit about what I mean by

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.193
a weak and bankrupt state.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:17.620
So much of the 1990s had been a period of

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:23.253
fiscal crisis for the old Soviet Union.

00:44:24.262 --> 00:44:25.120
There had been

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:30.283
massive debt racked up by the government.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.000
They were heavily
dependent on oil revenues,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.110
which I'll talk more
about in a little while,

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.360
and

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.190
when the price of oil gyrated,

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:48.190
they would suddenly lose
massive amounts of income.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:49.833
And

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.310
this had all come to a head in 1998

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:57.113
when Russia eventually,
when the Soviet Union,

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:02.220
I'm sorry, when Russia by
then, defaulted on its debt

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.403
and had to be bailed out by the IMF.

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:10.290
And so throughout the 1990s

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:15.070
the Russian government
was fiscally strapped.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:18.050
And so what happened was

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.370
that people took advantage of this fact.

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:24.430
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who
would later become famous

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.987
for his ownership of Yukos, the

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:31.480
private oil company,

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.460
which I'll also have a
little bit more to say about,

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.350
he started a bank called Menatep Bank.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:40.883
And what he basically did was he,

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:45.210
he speculated against the ruble,
he would get the government

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.480
to deposit large numbers
of rubles in his bank,

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.333
he would then,

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.160
he would exchange them into hard currency

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.040
and he would have a
commitment from the government

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.100
not to demand them back for four months,

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.880
or six months, or eight months,

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:03.880
and so essentially could
speculate against the ruble,

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.929
making large amounts of money.

00:46:07.929 --> 00:46:12.383
And he would pay it back
later in less valuable funds.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.990
So there were people
doing that kind of thing.

00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.823
And then

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.080
there was the so-called
loans for shares scheme,

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.870
which is how he got control of Yukos

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:29.500
and this was in the mid-1990s,

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:34.500
once the sort of bloom was
off the rose of the revolution

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.653
and people were starting to get angry.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.880
Things weren't improving fast enough.

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.960
Population was hungry.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.850
And it didn't look like,

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.040
it didn't look good for
Yeltsin's reelection.

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.080
There was looming elections in 1996

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.610
and there had been something
of a communist resurgence.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:02.610
They did extremely well in the
1995 legislative elections.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.290
And so the oligarchs who
had started to emerge

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:10.940
and who'd get control
of these various assets

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:13.910
realized that for them
it would be a disaster

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:16.740
if the communists came back into power.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:20.977
And so they decided to get
massively behind Yeltsin,

00:47:20.977 --> 00:47:22.810
and they did two things.

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:24.770
One was the so-called loans for shares,

00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:27.530
where they essentially
lent the government money

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:31.040
in return for shares in state companies,

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.750
and Khodorkovsky

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:36.490
did this with respect to oil,

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:40.230
and of course later on

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:42.300
the government couldn't repay the loans

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.620
and so they would get to keep the shares.

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.680
And so this was another way in which

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.600
a lot of these state assets were looted.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.580
But then they also just poured money

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.870
into Yeltsin's reelection campaign in 1996

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:04.250
and he was handily reelected

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:09.163
against the communist
candidate in the second round.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:12.510
So basically

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:16.400
the oligarchs managed to emerge

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.500
by taking advantage of the fact

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.740
that the former Soviet Union was broke,

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.670
and Russia in particular was broke

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:28.653
for the vast majority of the 1990s.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.470
Then at the end of the 1990s, as I said,

00:48:35.470 --> 00:48:37.980
by then even the Communist Party

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.933
had sort of gotten
religion about capitalism.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:46.710
Yeltsin had reappointed
many former communists

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:51.170
to his government, but they
got behind the reforms anyway,

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:55.020
and so we saw that capitalism

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.690
was not going away in
Russia any time soon,

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:01.540
even though the country was staggering

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.430
from debt crisis to debt crisis

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:07.263
pretty much for the bulk of that decade.

00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:11.570
In comes Putin, and now we start to see

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:16.390
a very different politics
and economics emerging.

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:21.390
And so what I want to do
now is focus on how Yeltsin,

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.370
how Yeltsin's

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.840
oligarchs if you like,
were rather different

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.910
from what was coming down the pike.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.860
So what I've said so far is that

00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:40.760
the Soviet Union at the end of its years

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.870
and certainly Russia in its first decade

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:47.330
as a sovereign country,
had a very weak state.

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:49.877
The party had been strong
and the state had been weak

00:49:49.877 --> 00:49:51.140
in the Soviet Union,

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:53.543
but the party had
essentially disintegrated.

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.880
But I haven't defined my terms.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.160
So I probably should
have done this earlier,

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.610
but what do we mean when
we talk about a state

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.763
being a weak state,
what makes a state weak?

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.180
Yeah, you're gonna have to yell.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:12.810
- [Student] Lack of a rule of law?

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.070
- Lack of the rule of law.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:18.820
That would be one symptom
certainly of a weak state.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:22.079
What else would be a symptom of, yeah.

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:23.530
(muffled speaking)

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:24.790
You gotta yell.

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:27.013
- [Student] No control over
violence within its borders

00:50:27.013 --> 00:50:27.953
or with it's borders themselves.

00:50:27.953 --> 00:50:30.590
- That would be another sign.

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.403
Any other signs of a weak state, yeah.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.340
Somebody's point, yeah.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.040
- [Student] Finances.

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.823
- So one sign, yeah, of
a weak state is that,

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:47.883
an inability to tax.

00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.950
A low capacity to raise revenue.

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:57.950
And the Russia that Putin
inherited had a very,

00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:01.430
very bad tax system, very low enforcement.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:04.010
So for example, in the oil industry,

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.610
which is the most important
industry in the Soviet Union,

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:13.430
they taxed output and exports, not profits

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:16.230
because they didn't have
the auditing capacity

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.860
to see whether people, you know,

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.920
profits are revenue minus costs,

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.380
and they didn't have
the capacity to audit,

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:29.410
to stop companies from hiding

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:32.383
profits.

00:51:32.383 --> 00:51:35.720
And so they would tax in
a very inefficient way

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:37.010
because that creates

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:40.923
very bad incentives as well to innovate.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:46.410
So they didn't have the capacity
to raise revenue very well,

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:49.670
and indeed throughout the 1990s

00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:54.170
the oligarchs, led by
Khodorkovsky by the way,

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:57.890
had waged war on efforts
by the Russian government

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:00.153
to improve the capacity to tax.

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:04.490
They had constantly lobbied for,

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:06.640
and been successful in getting,

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:10.410
the parliament not to
improve the capacity to tax,

00:52:10.410 --> 00:52:15.360
and when Yeltsin came into
power, in January of 2000,

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.610
his first speech was
mostly about taxation.

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:23.440
He said that he was determined to reform

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.640
the finances of the Soviet Union

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.480
and he was going to completely
reform the tax system,

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.403
which he did.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.260
They had a very complex,
multi-tiered system

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:36.270
with huge deductions.

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:39.860
He brought in a 13% flat tax,

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:44.020
kept taxes low across the
board with no exceptions,

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:48.280
and he greatly simplified
corporate taxation as well.

00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.180
So one of his big missions

00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.580
was to put Russia's fiscal house in order.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:56.580
And indeed, he partly got lucky

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.470
because the price of oil went up,

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:00.600
but they used a lot of that money,

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.830
they created a sovereign
wealth fund for a rainy day,

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:07.040
knowing about the
volatility of oil prices.

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:11.260
And indeed, when the
financial crisis finally hit,

00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:14.970
later in the decade, Russia
was pretty well placed

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.650
to weather that storm.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:21.790
So that's one thing that
Putin did in the first decade

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:24.630
of this century to try,

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:26.950
and people thought at the time

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:29.963
that he was strengthening
the Russian state.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.100
But the other side of a weak state

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:36.740
is the haphazard use of power.

00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:40.295
And by this I'm referring to the idea that

00:53:40.295 --> 00:53:45.295
when a government's capacity
to enforce things is low,

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:50.120
it has to compensate
by being unpredictable.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.170
So for example,

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:54.980
in a famous article about
18th century England,

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:56.990
there were no police in
18th century England,

00:53:56.990 --> 00:54:00.783
they didn't get police
until the 19th century.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:05.993
1834, I believe, or 1832,
somewhere around there.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.970
But if you look over the course

00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:12.160
of the 18th century in England,

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:16.243
the number of capital
offenses went up massively.

00:54:17.890 --> 00:54:20.380
You could be hanged
for being a pickpocket.

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.200
But the number of executions
remained constant.

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.030
They didn't actually execute more people.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:27.960
So basically what would happen

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.830
is that the assizes would come into town,

00:54:30.830 --> 00:54:32.450
they would string up a few people,

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:35.340
and then they'd go off to the next parish.

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.850
Because that was the only
capacity that they had,

00:54:37.850 --> 00:54:39.560
so there's a kind of trade off.

00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:41.663
But one symptom of,

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:46.350
one symptom of a weak
state, is the haphazard

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:51.730
and often dramatic use
of power in this way.

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:55.370
And anyone who's read Foucault's
"Discipline and Punish"

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:59.640
the opening pages of a gory execution

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:03.330
of somebody on the scaffold
is again an illustration

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:06.330
not of a strong state,
but of a weak state.

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:10.090
Again, when you see
the Egyptian government

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:13.440
sentencing hundreds of
people to death on one day,

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:15.840
almost none of whom end up being executed,

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:19.460
it's a sign of a weak
state, not a strong state.

00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:22.500
So haphazard use of power.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.990
And you look at Putin's early moves,

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:27.520
and they underscore this.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.280
The most important thing he did

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:32.640
was he took down Khodorkovsky.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:37.640
Khodorkovsky by then was the
most wealthy Russian oligarch.

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:42.030
Owner of Yukos, and

00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:45.343
Putin threw him in prison.

00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:51.410
He was charged with various forms of fraud

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:54.990
and eventually, when he'd
already been in prison

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:58.150
for about a year he was finally sentenced

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:01.210
to nine years of imprisonment.

00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:06.120
And this got the attention of
many of the other oligarchs.

00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.250
Nobody thought that Putin

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:12.870
would have the temerity or
the capacity to do this,

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:15.030
but because of his KGB background,

00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:18.437
he had been a KGB officer in East Germany

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.720
before he came back to the new Russia,

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:24.830
he was able to do that.

00:56:24.830 --> 00:56:27.903
And then not only did he throw,

00:56:30.393 --> 00:56:32.280
not only did he throw

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:38.780
Khodorkovsky in prison,
he basically seized back

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:40.800
through a complex transaction,

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.800
which I'm not gonna
describe, much of Yukos,

00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:48.053
and claimed it for Rosneft,

00:56:49.322 --> 00:56:52.083
the state oil company.

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.633
And then he took down Vyakhirev,

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:02.960
who, as I said to you earlier,

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.100
he had essentially been giving away

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.663
gas fields and profits and so on.

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:10.633
And

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:15.130
William Browder, about
who I'm about to tell you

00:57:15.130 --> 00:57:17.760
a little bit more, had exposed this.

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:22.760
William Browder was the head
of the Hermitage hedge fund

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:25.100
and

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:29.780
he had done a lot of
research on the way in which

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:33.440
these gas fields were being given away

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:38.380
and published them in the
New York Times and elsewhere.

00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:42.500
And Wall Street Journal,
Financial Times, and so on.

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:45.940
And everybody thought this guy is crazy.

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:48.830
He's gonna get himself killed.

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:52.690
But Putin responded instead

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.440
by firing

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:01.220
his chief of Gazprom

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.600
and again reclaiming many of the assets

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.780
that had essentially been given away

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:10.060
at bargain basement prices.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:10.893
So

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.633
Browder's worth pausing to
think about for a minute.

00:58:17.678 --> 00:58:22.260
He was actually the
grandson of Earl Browder,

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:25.410
who had run as the
communist representative

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:30.403
against FDR for the US presidency in 1940.

00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:36.060
But he didn't get along
with his family traditions.

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:39.540
His parents had also been very
much on the political left,

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.100
and he didn't get along with his parents,

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:44.350
and he thought, how can
I annoy them the most

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:46.550
and the way I can annoy them the most

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:48.860
is by becoming a capitalist.

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:51.980
And so he had gone to
Stanford business school

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.140
and worked for Boston Consulting Group

00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:57.350
and got himself to be
in on the ground floor

00:58:57.350 --> 00:59:01.460
for the first privatizations in 1989

00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:02.820
and 1990,

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:07.543
and then he had gone to Russia.

00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.530
And he became involved essentially in,

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:17.120
he built up the biggest, at
that time by far the biggest

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.090
hedge fund in the Soviet Union,

00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:23.490
it soon became worth well
over a billion dollars.

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:26.170
And the way he did it

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:31.170
was by taking on Russian
corruption in firms.

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:34.780
So the first company he bought,
he bought an oil company

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:37.663
and he had some shares
in this company, and,

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:46.430
the management of the company
decided to respond to this

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:50.060
by diluting his shares,
essentially they were gonna offer

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:54.240
a whole block of new shares,
but not allow him to buy any.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:58.610
So effectually diluting
the value of his shares.

00:59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.800
And he filed a shareholder's lawsuit,

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.560
again people said you're
crazy, you're gonna be killed.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.070
And he prevailed.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:12.070
And the share dilution scheme was stopped.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.910
And again, when he went after Gazprom

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:17.920
and exposed what they were doing,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.200
he was convinced

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.520
that he had figured out what he could do

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:26.913
and that he was immune
because he was a foreigner.

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.230
He's a famous person today for
reasons that will be obvious

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:34.270
from this video clip.

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.190
- Joining us first on CNBC to react,

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:37.490
the man in question Bill Browder,

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:39.650
Hermitage Capital Management.

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:41.710
Bill, good to have you here,
I bet you're not surprised

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:44.550
to hear Vladimir Putin
refer to you directly.

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:46.930
- It's not the first time and
it won't be the last time.

01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:49.620
Vladimir Putin is very mad at me.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.740
He's mad at me because
of the Magnitsky Act.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.010
The Magnitsky Act is
a piece of legislation

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.760
named after my murdered
lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:01.800
He was murdered after
uncovering a $230 million

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.540
Russian corruption scandal.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:07.520
Some of that $230 million went
to Vladimir Putin himself.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.450
And so Putin feels personally exposed

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:14.100
and potentially at risk
of having his assets

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.840
seized in the West, and
so every chance he gets

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:21.630
he tries to get foreign
countries to come after me.

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:24.240
This is just one of many of his attempts.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:26.730
- He leveled an accusation
at you, that you funneled,

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:30.380
and helped funnel lots of money
to Hillary Clinton, did you?

01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.570
- I did not.

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:33.540
I did not, I'm not a US citizen,

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:34.660
I don't live in the United States,

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.870
I've been living in Britain for 29 years.

01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:40.003
I make no campaign contributions.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:43.730
And so that's not true,
I should also point out

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:46.360
that Vladimir Putin and his regime

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.260
have accused me of serial killing,

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.930
of being a CIA, MI6 agent,

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:54.150
and about a thousand other
things, and so they just kind of,

01:01:54.150 --> 01:01:57.210
he's kind of unhinged
in these accusations.

01:01:57.210 --> 01:01:59.780
- You said before, Bill, that
this is not the first time

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.640
that President Putin has
mentioned you, has called you out.

01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.570
What is your reaction in terms
of your personal security

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:08.950
after such a news conference,
do you increase it,

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.520
do you look behind you when
you're walking down the street

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.310
a little bit more often?

01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:16.430
- Well my personal
security has been at risk

01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:17.710
for a very long time.

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:21.150
This is not, this struggle
that I'm having with Putin

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.980
has been going on for 10 years.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.760
I mean, just a month ago
on May 30th in Madrid,

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:30.040
I was arrested on a Russian
Interpol arrest warrant

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.453
by the Spanish police.

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:35.620
Thankfully I was, Interpol
contacted them two hours

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:38.320
after I was arrested and
made sure I was released,

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.100
but the Russians have been
coming after me for a long time

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.680
and so I'm not surprised,
it doesn't change anything.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.250
I'm always on high alert.

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:47.840
And there's a lot of
people around the world,

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.393
governments, people, who
are looking after me.

01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:55.180
- So what had happened
with Browder was that

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:59.070
he believed in these early
years of the Putin regime,

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:03.080
he believed that it was
all due to his own acumen

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.080
as an investor and his status as,

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:10.950
at that time he was a US citizen,

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:15.020
that he was able to go
after these oligarchs.

01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:18.540
What he didn't understand,
and that he learned later,

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.540
was that he was pushing
against an open door

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:25.060
because he was going
after Yeltsin's oligarchs

01:03:26.262 --> 01:03:29.290
which Putin also wanted to get rid of.

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:33.740
But once he started going
after Putin's oligarchs

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:35.710
he ran into a brick wall.

01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:39.530
His accountant and lawyer, Magnitsky,

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:43.600
was killed by the Russian police

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:48.550
in a horrific scheme that's
described at great length

01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:50.163
in his book "Red Notice"

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.070
and he then went on this crusade

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:55.020
to get the Magnitsky Act passed,

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.806
which enables the US
government to seize the assets

01:03:58.806 --> 01:04:02.040
of oligarchs who are involved
in illegal activities,

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:04.703
and which was used after,

01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:07.880
after the invasion of

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.050
Ukraine in 2014.

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:13.390
And that's what the famous 2016

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:15.370
Trump Tower meeting was about,

01:04:15.370 --> 01:04:19.740
that the Putin regime was trying to get

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:24.700
Trump to promise that they
would repeal the Magnitsky Act.

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.803
And so that saga is ongoing.

01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:35.450
So Russia, one of the most
corrupt countries in the world,

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:40.450
you can see here it's up there
with countries like Nigeria.

01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:45.600
This is one standard measure of corruption

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:48.313
from Transparency International.

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:52.260
You can see this is

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:55.630
subjective perceptions of corruption

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:57.303
in Russia that people think,

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:00.650
the vast majority of people think

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:05.453
the vast majority of the
Russian state is highly corrupt.

01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.280
And one question is well
why is it so corrupt?

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.510
One obvious answer is a kind
of path dependence story

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:16.740
that we've talked about,

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.230
that the fact that all
these assets could be seized

01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:23.490
by former Soviet
bureaucrats on the way out,

01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:26.500
or could be extracted
from this very weak state,

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:31.500
particularly in the 1990s,
is a big part of the story.

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:38.890
Secondly, there's this
notion of a resource curse,

01:05:38.890 --> 01:05:42.660
which is often called

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:46.590
the oil curse.

01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:49.833
And here, this is the
political economist's story.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.690
Now the Russian economy

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.023
at first glance doesn't look like

01:05:57.023 --> 01:06:00.280
it's so completely
dominated by the oil sector.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:01.690
You can see here

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:06.350
at least half of the
Russian economy is services,

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:11.290
but if you start to look
a little bit more closely

01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:14.860
you see that while there are,

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:19.860
you know, many different
sectors in the Russian economy,

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:23.480
one way or another the
vast majority of them

01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:27.090
are connected to the hydrocarbon industry,

01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:29.300
three quarters of the Russian economy.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.493
So it's very oil dependent.

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:37.070
You can see, and this
is even more important,

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:42.070
that the government's revenue
is massively dependent on oil.

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:48.430
The only countries that
are more oil dependent

01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:51.360
for government revenue are places like

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.653
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Nigeria, Venezuela.

01:06:57.270 --> 01:07:02.270
The Economist magazine in
2016 estimated that 40%

01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:07.280
of the Russian government's
revenue is from oil.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.940
And this of course makes
for a lot of corruption

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:14.730
because if the only way
to get rich in Russia

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:17.440
is to have access to the oil sector,

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.830
then people who control that access

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:25.780
can extract huge premiums
for letting you participate.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.560
This is what makes Russian finances

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.873
so dependent on the price of oil.

01:07:33.657 --> 01:07:36.230
And as you can, this is
just another picture,

01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:39.060
which I will post these
and you can peruse them

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.650
at your leisure, but you can see that

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:46.910
if oil prices fall, government revenues

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:50.240
also fall with them.

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.530
Which raises the question,

01:07:51.530 --> 01:07:53.913
why don't they diversify their economy?

01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:59.590
Why wouldn't they diversify
the economy if it makes,

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:04.200
they're so hostage to the price of oil.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.613
Quick suggestion, anybody?

01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:07.850
Why don't they?

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:08.868
- [Student] They can't.

01:08:08.868 --> 01:08:09.984
- Pardon?
- They can't.

01:08:09.984 --> 01:08:12.400
They don't have the
ability to move like that.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.508
- Why don't they?

01:08:14.508 --> 01:08:17.700
- [Student] Because their
structure is just so incomplete.

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.700
- So the beneficiaries,
I would use beneficiaries

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:23.980
where you use structure, the
beneficiaries like it this way,

01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:27.650
they're making huge amounts
of money out of it, right?

01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:31.230
The government needs it
because it's very difficult

01:08:31.230 --> 01:08:35.043
for them to raise money in any other way.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.560
As I've said, the capacity,

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.240
the institutional capacity
of the Russian state

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:44.750
to raise money in other
ways is very constrained.

01:08:44.750 --> 01:08:47.700
But also, from the point
of view of the government

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.350
it's a source of geopolitical power.

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:54.810
If you think about where
does all of this oil go.

01:08:54.810 --> 01:08:58.530
Think about Western Europe,
you can see here that

01:08:58.530 --> 01:09:00.640
three of the biggest companies

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:05.400
selling oil to Western
Europe are Russian companies.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:08.750
And if you look at where
European countries get their oil,

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.810
just look at Germany,

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:15.810
it's the top importer of Russian crude oil

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.530
in the world.

01:09:17.530 --> 01:09:22.530
And this is why the
Russian invasion of Ukraine

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.510
played out the way it
did because not only oil,

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:29.550
you can see here, Germany
is the biggest consumer

01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:32.490
of Russian natural gas in the world.

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:36.980
So if you think about
Russia going into NATO

01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:39.250
and the NATO alliance,

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:41.980
which we're gonna be
talking about on Tuesday,

01:09:41.980 --> 01:09:46.170
putting together and
speaking with one voice

01:09:46.170 --> 01:09:50.080
about responding to the
Russian invasion of Ukraine,

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.840
it's not gonna be something that's high

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:54.180
on Angela Merkel's agenda.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.500
She needs Russian oil and gas,

01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:01.500
she can't afford to
antagonize the Russian regime.

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:07.090
And so it was not surprising
that the response to NATO

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:11.060
was a lot of hand wringing
and strong statements,

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.630
but nothing more than that.

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:16.750
So it's because it's a
source of geopolitical power

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:21.000
for a weak state that it's very desirable

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.200
from the point of view of Putin

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:27.030
to retain this powerful sector.

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:29.373
Okay, we will see you next week.

01:10:33.038 --> 01:10:35.705
(chiming music)

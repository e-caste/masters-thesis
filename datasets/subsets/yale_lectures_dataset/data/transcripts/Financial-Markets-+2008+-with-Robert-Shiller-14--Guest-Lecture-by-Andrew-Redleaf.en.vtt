00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.578
Mr.
Andrew Redleaf: I

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:07.042
think--the, sort of,
first thing that I think most

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:11.284
people think about or the first
question when you're thinking

00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:15.101
about financial markets is
whether they're efficient or

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:19.272
not--whether they incorporate
all known information--if it's

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:24.112
possible to do,
sort of, significantly better

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:29.831
than the market as a whole.
I'm not sure--used to be

00:00:29.831 --> 00:00:36.366
absolutely received economic
wisdom that financial markets

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:41.671
were efficient.
Now it's--I think it's still

00:00:41.671 --> 00:00:48.037
the dominant academic view,
but there's a big debate and

00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:52.320
there are partisans on both
sides.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.541
It's actually--to me,
it's actually a fairly simple

00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.543
question.
The efficient--the notion that

00:00:58.543 --> 00:01:03.131
markets are efficient derives
from an a priori theory,

00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:07.260
which is the same sort of
theory about all markets.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.962
There are lots of incentives,
people acting in their own

00:01:11.962 --> 00:01:17.439
interests--they have to do that.
It's a very appealing kind of

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.225
a priori theory,
but the thing about theories is

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:25.769
they're supposed to make
predictions.

00:01:25.769 --> 00:01:29.582
If some of the things they
predict don't come true,

00:01:29.582 --> 00:01:33.700
the theory has to be
disregarded and there are many,

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.560
many, many counter examples to
financial market efficiencies.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.275
On one level,
there are things like companies

00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:49.427
that have two different classes
of stock that are economically

00:01:49.427 --> 00:01:58.244
identical.
Royal Shell used to have Dutch

00:01:58.244 --> 00:02:08.170
shares that traded in Holland
and U.K.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:14.062
shares traded in London.
Economically identical,

00:02:14.062 --> 00:02:20.331
but their prices would
fluctuate and fairly

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:24.731
dramatically.
In '98, I forget which way,

00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:28.903
but one of the share classes
was at a 20% discount to the

00:02:28.903 --> 00:02:32.330
other and that persisted for
several years,

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.069
so you have economically
identical things trading at

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.291
different prices.
You have closed end funds,

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:43.285
which are vehicles that own a
set of other securities--trade

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:47.180
as a security listed on the
stock exchange,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.080
but what they do is own other
securities.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.635
And whether they trade to a
discount--whether the security

00:02:55.635 --> 00:03:01.678
in the closed end fund trades at
a discount or a premium to the

00:03:01.678 --> 00:03:06.941
stuff they own--fluctuates
meaningfully in a way that's

00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:12.009
sort of difficult to recognize
with the idea that the

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:17.370
securities should be reflecting
economic value.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.594
You have what are called stubs,
where one public company owns a

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:26.470
significant stake in another
public company.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.235
In instances where the
one--3Com owned Palm,

00:03:32.235 --> 00:03:40.682
and the value of its Palm stake
greatly exceeded the total value

00:03:40.682 --> 00:03:46.180
of the market capitalization of
3Com;

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.870
that persisted for a number of
years.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.262
In general, less volatile
stocks have done better over

00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:04.593
time than more volatile stocks,
which is somewhat inconsistent

00:04:04.593 --> 00:04:08.360
with the notion of efficient
markets.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:17.430
Lastly, there is a meaningful
number of individuals and

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.470
institutions whose,
sort of,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.411
performance look--whose
performance in portfolios is

00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:34.819
really inconsistent with the
markets being efficient.

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:41.048
It can't really be explained
away by--some of them can

00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:47.630
but--by luck or by inside
information or by something,

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:57.329
while there's sort of a big
academic debate.

00:04:57.329 --> 00:05:00.197
Then lastly,
there are things like the

00:05:00.197 --> 00:05:03.607
Internet bubble,
or more recently the housing

00:05:03.607 --> 00:05:07.733
bubble,
or--they're not usually called

00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:14.170
this, but--the lending bubble
where--or the subprime mess.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.180
Lots and lots of loans,
the securities that people

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:25.416
bought at par that were worth
about somewhere between zero and

00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:29.199
$.15 or $.20 and now trade
there.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.234
I don't believe that markets
are efficient and it doesn't

00:05:36.234 --> 00:05:42.389
really seem like it should be an
open question.

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:46.618
The people that believe it have
to die and then nobody will

00:05:46.618 --> 00:05:50.291
believe it anymore.
Not very many of them change

00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:54.114
their mind though they come up
with more convoluted

00:05:54.114 --> 00:06:00.034
explanations--clever,
convoluted explanations for the

00:06:00.034 --> 00:06:08.204
counter factual--for the things
that happen in reality that the

00:06:08.204 --> 00:06:14.937
theory doesn't predict.
So, markets aren't that

00:06:14.937 --> 00:06:19.364
efficient.
On the other hand,

00:06:19.364 --> 00:06:27.740
sort of doing better than the
markets is a non-trivial

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:38.170
exercise and it's not as easy as
it might appear or as--I mean,

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.480
some people think it's
impossible;

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.279
other people think it's really
easy.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:47.205
It's actually not impossible,
but hard, and there are a

00:06:47.205 --> 00:06:52.840
number of challenges.
First, for individuals,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:01.089
I think the primary challenge
is if an individual sticks to,

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:04.465
sort of, areas where they might
have an informational advantage

00:07:04.465 --> 00:07:07.459
or at least don't have an
informational disadvantage,

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:14.857
they won't own a diversified
portfolio of securities because

00:07:14.857 --> 00:07:20.750
their informational advantage
will be narrow.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:29.910
They also have sort of limited
access to the gamut of products

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:38.769
and so forth--restricted access
and restricted offerings.

00:07:38.769 --> 00:07:42.470
So, that's a challenge for
individuals.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:53.350
Institutions are sort of
professional investors;

00:07:53.350 --> 00:08:01.152
all spend a lot of money on
information, which requires

00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:07.509
infrastructure and resources and
so forth.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:11.417
But the very,
sort of, nature of being an

00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:16.790
institution constrains almost
everybody whether it's,

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:22.289
in our case,
all our investors have

00:08:22.289 --> 00:08:28.429
thirty-day liquidity.
They can--in mutual funds,

00:08:28.429 --> 00:08:33.268
it's daily liquidity,
but their investors tend not to

00:08:33.268 --> 00:08:38.255
be as wide-awake.
But that's a constraint on

00:08:38.255 --> 00:08:44.987
us--that, except for the
principles, maybe their families

00:08:44.987 --> 00:08:48.805
maybe not,
all our money can disappear in

00:08:48.805 --> 00:08:52.490
thirty days, so we have to be
cognizant of that.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:09:01.797
We have clients that have,
sort of, a set of expectations,

00:09:01.797 --> 00:09:09.797
which you also have to,
if not be cognizant about,

00:09:09.797 --> 00:09:15.886
sort of deal with.
Then there are,

00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:24.209
kind of, universal
psychological challenges--biases

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:34.529
in people's thinking--and a
number of things that are just,

00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:40.019
sort of, difficult for human
beings to process and make

00:09:40.019 --> 00:09:46.936
intelligent decisions.
I think that's kind of in the

00:09:46.936 --> 00:09:56.045
area of mine and one of the
things that drew me to Professor

00:09:56.045 --> 00:10:04.844
Shiller and some of his other
colleagues and that's really

00:10:04.844 --> 00:10:13.798
universal to not just financial
markets but to all decision

00:10:13.798 --> 00:10:18.595
making.
I think, particularly in the

00:10:18.595 --> 00:10:24.241
kinds of the things that have a
serious mix of randomness and

00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:29.417
skill--that's sort of the
hardest thing for human beings

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:34.404
to process--something that's
kind of an unknown mix of

00:10:34.404 --> 00:10:41.319
randomness and skill.
We can understand something

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:49.720
that's fully random and work out
the statistics and be

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:56.059
comfortable with that to some
degree.

00:10:56.059 --> 00:11:02.397
Things that are sort of
completely cut and dry,

00:11:02.397 --> 00:11:07.632
fully determinative,
we like those too,

00:11:07.632 --> 00:11:13.970
but stuff that's mixed is very,
very hard.

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:21.128
I mean, quantum mechanics makes
sense to no human being,

00:11:21.128 --> 00:11:25.250
in my view.
In those areas,

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:33.350
people are inclined to do sort
of strange things.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:38.000
I mean, one thing--I play a
fair amount of--I play a little

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.090
bit of poker and I'm very
interested in the game.

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:46.997
It's sort of--it's a little
like the markets and other

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:51.905
things in that there's an
element of randomness and an

00:11:51.905 --> 00:11:56.220
element of skill.
One thing that I find

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:01.862
interesting--typically,
if you play poker in a card

00:12:01.862 --> 00:12:06.263
room or a casino,
I would say nine times out of

00:12:06.263 --> 00:12:10.625
ten somebody sitting at the
table will tell you that they're

00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:13.840
not trying;
it almost always happens.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.600
They'll say,
I usually play for more money

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:25.450
and it's hard to concentrate or
I'm just screwing around.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:31.312
Why do they do that?
What's--why do they not--they

00:12:31.312 --> 00:12:35.799
could just be screwing around,
but why do they tell you?

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:44.285
It's kind of my pet theory that
they would rather--they're

00:12:44.285 --> 00:12:51.247
setting up in advance to lose.
They would rather lose because

00:12:51.247 --> 00:12:56.009
they're sort of screwing around
than--that's easier for them to,

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:59.800
sort of, deal with than
to--they could put out their

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.549
best game and they would do
better,

00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:06.483
but they might lose anyone
given its, sort of,

00:13:06.483 --> 00:13:10.266
randomness.
It is--that's the thing about

00:13:10.266 --> 00:13:15.559
really good poker players versus
less good poker players.

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:20.771
Really good poker players play
close to their best all the time

00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:24.889
and they're not really bothered
when they lose;

00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:30.840
I think that's true in markets
too.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:36.773
In all sorts of decisions,
what people are inclined to do

00:13:36.773 --> 00:13:42.919
or are very interested in doing
is setting up posturing for

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:49.595
credit and blame in advance and
sort of having a pre-made excuse

00:13:49.595 --> 00:13:54.757
if things don't go right.
They're more interested,

00:13:54.757 --> 00:13:58.902
to some degree at least,
in having an excuse if things

00:13:58.902 --> 00:14:02.976
don't go right,
than in sort of maximizing the

00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:07.775
chance that things go right
because even maximizing the

00:14:07.775 --> 00:14:12.000
chance that things go right,
you can't get it to be 100%;

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.480
there's an element of
randomness.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:18.007
Bad things can happen,
so it's really,

00:14:18.007 --> 00:14:24.860
really hard to just focus on
getting things right and not

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:30.427
winning the argument.
Setting yourself up before the

00:14:30.427 --> 00:14:34.691
fact so that you can win an
argument after the fact,

00:14:34.691 --> 00:14:38.370
so that you didn't--you just
got unlucky.

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:51.455
People are very inclined to see
things as determinative to

00:14:51.455 --> 00:14:55.139
attribute--and not just in
markets,

00:14:55.139 --> 00:14:59.381
but in the psychology
literature--to believe

00:14:59.381 --> 00:15:05.398
if--you're wired to believe if
something--if A happened before

00:15:05.398 --> 00:15:08.710
B,
A caused B.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:16.505
B has to be caused by something
and A happened first,

00:15:16.505 --> 00:15:24.600
before it, so that's what--so
they assign causality.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:33.689
They're also inclined to focus
on sort of recent things--things

00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:40.580
they see even if you know
they're irrelevant.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.518
For example,
in the psychology literature,

00:15:44.518 --> 00:15:49.320
famous example is--famous kind
of test question is:

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:55.083
a tester will give the person
taking the test the name of two

00:15:55.083 --> 00:16:01.135
cities that they've never heard
of and the distance that they're

00:16:01.135 --> 00:16:06.037
apart.
So, two random cities,

00:16:06.037 --> 00:16:11.860
XYZ and ABC,
are 4,200 miles apart.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.294
Then they'll give them two
other cities that they've never

00:16:15.294 --> 00:16:18.789
heard of and ask them how far
apart they think they are.

00:16:18.789 --> 00:16:21.886
People anchor to the
information they were given,

00:16:21.886 --> 00:16:25.758
even though there's kind of no
causality or no sort of reason

00:16:25.758 --> 00:16:28.210
why it should make any
difference.

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.219
If the referenced cities,
the first cities,

00:16:31.219 --> 00:16:34.802
are 4,200 miles apart,
the answers for the next two

00:16:34.802 --> 00:16:41.698
will center around 4,200 miles.
If the referenced cities were

00:16:41.698 --> 00:16:48.659
2,500 miles apart,
they'll center about that.

00:16:48.659 --> 00:16:55.765
I think it's useful to,
sort of, know all the

00:16:55.765 --> 00:17:05.130
hard-wiring biases that people
have to try and de-bias your

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:11.289
thinking,
but it's not easy and in lots

00:17:11.289 --> 00:17:18.009
of cases it's not actually
people's objectives.

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:22.110
Any of you watch Mad Money on
CNBC--Jim Cramer?

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.930
Any Cramerites?
Nobody?

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:33.794
Well he starts his show,
"Some people want to make

00:17:33.794 --> 00:17:37.880
friends;
I just want to make money."

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.127
If you watch the show and you
see Cramer, it's pretty

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:46.940
believable.
I think it's true.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:54.465
Almost everybody in financial
markets is capable of saying

00:17:54.465 --> 00:17:57.805
that.
"I don't want to make friends,

00:17:57.805 --> 00:18:01.882
I just want to make money."
But for most of them it's not

00:18:01.882 --> 00:18:05.001
true.
They have all sorts of things

00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:09.160
that they want to do other than
make money.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:17.096
They have office politics;
they have any number of other

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:24.768
motivations.
That psychology is really hard

00:18:24.768 --> 00:18:31.417
and somewhat applicable to not
just markets,

00:18:31.417 --> 00:18:34.510
but other things.

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:47.394
Markets aren't efficient,
but it's not that easy to beat

00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:51.859
them.
What do we try to do?

00:18:51.859 --> 00:19:00.170
I, kind of, would highlight
what I view as three sorts of

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:05.856
principles.
The first, the investment

00:19:05.856 --> 00:19:11.716
world, I believe,
divides between coupon

00:19:11.716 --> 00:19:19.230
clippers--bonds historically
came with coupons,

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.831
actual sort of coupons like the
thing you bring to the grocery

00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:29.789
store and get twenty-five cents
off a can of coffee.

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:34.964
So, we have this security and a
ten-year bond would have twenty

00:19:34.964 --> 00:19:38.720
coupons attached,
each with a date on them.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.244
When the date came,
you would cut the coupon off

00:19:42.244 --> 00:19:46.069
and go to the bank and get your
interest payment.

00:19:46.069 --> 00:19:48.640
So, that was called coupon
clipping.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.546
Basically, something that you
would--coupons are things that

00:19:53.546 --> 00:19:56.789
you redeem for a stream of money
and,

00:19:56.789 --> 00:20:02.538
in my view, the world divides
between coupon clippers--people

00:20:02.538 --> 00:20:08.670
that are interested in cash flow
and taking in cash flow--and,

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:14.441
what I would call,
security resellers--people that

00:20:14.441 --> 00:20:21.508
own things that they intend to
sell to somebody in the future

00:20:21.508 --> 00:20:26.652
at a higher price.
There are successful coupon

00:20:26.652 --> 00:20:31.664
clippers and there are
successful securities resellers

00:20:31.664 --> 00:20:36.958
and they tend to make their
money off of the unsuccessful

00:20:36.958 --> 00:20:44.460
people in the other class.
We try to be--I think investing

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:52.274
is about clipping coupons,
about getting cash flow and

00:20:52.274 --> 00:20:57.730
getting and controlling cash
flow,

00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:03.403
but there are good resellers.
I think reselling is an element

00:21:03.403 --> 00:21:08.979
of things like venture capital.
The best venture capitalists

00:21:08.979 --> 00:21:16.430
don't just have great ideas or
whatever, but they take an idea,

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:21.658
they advance it a little bit,
and then they sex it up and

00:21:21.658 --> 00:21:27.634
promote it and have a good sense
for what the public will buy and

00:21:27.634 --> 00:21:31.930
they get a nice valuation from
the public.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:39.080
I think that's at least as much
a distinguishing feature between

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:45.663
good venture capitalists among
each other as the quality of

00:21:45.663 --> 00:21:50.215
their ideas.
There are sort of–Cramer,

00:21:50.215 --> 00:21:55.157
again--Cramer was a good
security reseller--had sort of a

00:21:55.157 --> 00:22:00.716
really good--spent a lot of time
and effort kind of figuring out

00:22:00.716 --> 00:22:05.569
what is it that people will want
to buy next week.

00:22:05.569 --> 00:22:11.778
That's what I'll buy today not
because I'll derive income off

00:22:11.778 --> 00:22:17.676
of it, but because it's what
people are going to want next

00:22:17.676 --> 00:22:22.230
week and I'll be able to sell it
higher.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.602
That's some art,
some science,

00:22:24.602 --> 00:22:29.020
and there are people that are
very, very good at it.

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:39.763
We try to clip coupons.
As to some--that's--it's a

00:22:39.763 --> 00:22:45.989
Warren Buffetism--he says,
all investing is about coupon

00:22:45.989 --> 00:22:52.441
clipping and the difference
between equities and bonds are

00:22:52.441 --> 00:22:59.120
that bonds come with a coupon
that's known and equities have

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.779
earnings in the future that you
don't know.

00:23:04.779 --> 00:23:08.973
You also don't know that
they'll give them to the equity

00:23:08.973 --> 00:23:13.701
owners and to management and not
to--they won't squander in the

00:23:13.701 --> 00:23:17.288
future.
But to Buffet it's sort of same

00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:22.961
thing--it's clipping coupons and
he describes his job as figuring

00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:28.103
out what the coupon is in an
equity and if it's high enough

00:23:28.103 --> 00:23:32.265
he likes it.
The first sort of principle to

00:23:32.265 --> 00:23:39.163
me is clipping coupons.
The second is that risk is

00:23:39.163 --> 00:23:49.630
primarily about what is the
worst thing that can happen.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:57.606
In a typical security--Wall
Street risk management--a lot of

00:23:57.606 --> 00:24:06.259
focus is on what is the range of
moderately probable outcomes.

00:24:06.259 --> 00:24:11.115
So, people talk about VAR,
value at risk,

00:24:11.115 --> 00:24:16.819
and lots of people try and
build VAR systems.

00:24:16.819 --> 00:24:21.344
What they are trying to
determine is how wide is the

00:24:21.344 --> 00:24:26.776
band of outcomes.
How wide is the band of stuff

00:24:26.776 --> 00:24:34.787
that has a 95% probability or a
98% probability--usually 95% or

00:24:34.787 --> 00:24:41.546
98%, but not 99.9%.
If you know I have a 98% chance

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:48.367
of not losing a dollar that
works in the VAR screen and

00:24:48.367 --> 00:24:54.936
the--and it won't tell
you--won't distinguish between

00:24:54.936 --> 00:25:02.390
whether the 2% chance is of
losing $10 or losing $100.

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:12.933
To me, that's a fundamentally
wrong approach and it's actually

00:25:12.933 --> 00:25:22.785
done because it's the sort of
thing that statisticians are

00:25:22.785 --> 00:25:26.205
good at.
To some degree,

00:25:26.205 --> 00:25:30.243
it's harder to imagine the
worst thing than to

00:25:30.243 --> 00:25:34.910
statistically sort of figure out
the middle band.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:39.022
There's a famous saying,
"If you're good with a hammer,

00:25:39.022 --> 00:25:45.063
everything looks like a nail."
That's sort of what that's

00:25:45.063 --> 00:25:53.516
like, but the really important
thing is what's the worst thing

00:25:53.516 --> 00:26:00.672
that can happen.
The last sort of principle,

00:26:00.672 --> 00:26:10.890
which is actually most at odds
with the academic community and

00:26:10.890 --> 00:26:16.280
even,
sort of, the general perception

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:22.029
is that you don't get paid for
taking risk,

00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:24.859
you get paid for eliminating
risk.

00:26:24.859 --> 00:26:28.700
I actually believe in the
history of the planet,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:32.213
there are very,
very few instances of people

00:26:32.213 --> 00:26:37.396
getting paid for taking risk;
they get paid for eliminating

00:26:37.396 --> 00:26:39.967
it.
As an example,

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:48.080
if you think about a tightrope
walker in the circus,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:57.306
there's a conception that he
gets paid because it's a risky

00:26:57.306 --> 00:27:03.359
job--he might fall down,
kill himself.

00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:06.480
I think that conception is
completely wrong.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.094
The lifetime earnings of a
tightwire walker who falls down

00:27:11.094 --> 00:27:14.089
and kills himself aren't very
good.

00:27:14.089 --> 00:27:19.707
In fact, what he's getting paid
for is that he practiced a whole

00:27:19.707 --> 00:27:25.325
lot when he was a little kid on
a wire that if he fell off of he

00:27:25.325 --> 00:27:30.408
wasn't going to get hurt and
that he's really getting paid

00:27:30.408 --> 00:27:35.223
for eliminating the risk of
falling off via practice as

00:27:35.223 --> 00:27:39.412
opposed to taking it.
You think about drug

00:27:39.412 --> 00:27:44.140
development--pharmaceutical
companies and people will say,

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:50.835
well discovering compounds that
are effective drugs is an

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:58.008
uncertain, risky business and so
pharmaceutical companies are

00:27:58.008 --> 00:28:03.030
able to get paid for taking that
risk.

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:07.378
I don't think so.
I think they get paid for

00:28:07.378 --> 00:28:12.456
applying intelligence and not
testing every--not for the

00:28:12.456 --> 00:28:18.736
compounds they test,
but for the ones that they've

00:28:18.736 --> 00:28:27.621
eliminated testing for because
they understand the chemistry or

00:28:27.621 --> 00:28:36.507
a disease process and have some
idea what sort of compounds are

00:28:36.507 --> 00:28:43.432
more likely to work than others.
I don't know if he remembers

00:28:43.432 --> 00:28:45.671
this.
When I last explained this to

00:28:45.671 --> 00:28:48.410
Professor Shiller,
he said, well what about

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:53.480
insurance companies?
I said, proves my point--the

00:28:53.480 --> 00:29:02.534
sort of exact case.
An individual has risk of

00:29:02.534 --> 00:29:12.643
certain bad things happening.
If the insurance company has

00:29:12.643 --> 00:29:16.180
risk, it's because they've made
a mistake.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:23.177
If they're sort of doing their
job right, they're actually

00:29:23.177 --> 00:29:30.666
diversifying away all the risk
and relying on the law of large

00:29:30.666 --> 00:29:34.644
numbers.
A casino does not have a risk

00:29:34.644 --> 00:29:39.827
that the law of large numbers
will be repealed and a roulette

00:29:39.827 --> 00:29:45.009
table will be a long-term losing
proposition or a craps table

00:29:45.009 --> 00:29:48.809
will be a long-term losing
proposition.

00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:53.350
They have risks that their
overhead won't cover or that

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:58.396
they won't have--their risk is
that a steady stream of people

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:03.105
won't come and be making a
steady stream of bets at which

00:30:03.105 --> 00:30:07.730
each of them has a slightly
negative expectation.

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:14.998
We really want to think,
whenever we look at anything,

00:30:14.998 --> 00:30:20.210
what kind of coupons can we
extract?

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:27.248
What's the worst possible thing
that can happen and how can we

00:30:27.248 --> 00:30:34.016
eliminate that?
We do that--sometimes it's by

00:30:34.016 --> 00:30:43.794
diversification--having a lot at
sort of independent sort of

00:30:43.794 --> 00:30:48.861
bets.
More times, it's having an

00:30:48.861 --> 00:30:56.921
offsetting kind of position
where we go long one security

00:30:56.921 --> 00:31:05.268
that's issued by a company and
short something else that we

00:31:05.268 --> 00:31:13.896
think eliminates our risk.
A common kind of position will

00:31:13.896 --> 00:31:22.366
be long a high-yielding--a bond
that yields sort of 15% or 16%

00:31:22.366 --> 00:31:28.010
and--I mean,
hypothetically a bond trading

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:35.499
at $.60 on the dollar with an 8%
coupon, five-year bond that's

00:31:35.499 --> 00:31:42.071
yielding about 18%.
Maybe the company has a $15

00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:49.097
equity price and will be short
$.15 of the equity,

00:31:49.097 --> 00:31:55.549
which we'll try and keep all
the way down.

00:31:55.549 --> 00:32:00.959
If the stock's $20 and we could
stay short $.20 worth of stock

00:32:00.959 --> 00:32:06.546
all the way down--if the company
went bankrupt--the company goes

00:32:06.546 --> 00:32:11.726
to zero--on our short position,
we'll have taken in about $60,

00:32:11.726 --> 00:32:15.880
which is what we owned the
bond--what we paid for the bond.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:22.530
We have a superior claim in
bankruptcy--we'll recover

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.367
something and,
in the meantime,

00:32:26.367 --> 00:32:32.250
we get this 8% coupon that we
get to clip.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:37.089
That's coupon clipping and risk
mitigation.

00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:41.806
Now, there's the other side of
the stock going up and we have

00:32:41.806 --> 00:32:46.759
to think about how much that can
cost us and whether our coupons

00:32:46.759 --> 00:32:51.318
are enough and whether the
difference between the $.60 that

00:32:51.318 --> 00:32:55.956
we paid and the $100 that the
bond matures enough--is apt to

00:32:55.956 --> 00:33:01.094
cover that.
But that's the sort of the

00:33:01.094 --> 00:33:07.962
thing we do and it's coupon
clipping and it's risk

00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:14.690
mitigation or risk
elimination--fairly short.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:22.496
The last thing I thought I'd
talk a little bit about is what

00:33:22.496 --> 00:33:30.170
some--what's happening in the
world today and the financial

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:39.132
system today,
which to us it's--if you're in

00:33:39.132 --> 00:33:50.991
trading and investing,
things happen in your world and

00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:57.480
they're just unbelievable.

00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:08.087
You go outside and you talk to
people that have jobs and lives

00:34:08.087 --> 00:34:15.034
or go to school and they're
completely unaware that--they

00:34:15.034 --> 00:34:21.610
have absolutely no idea that
this really amazing,

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.539
unbelievable thing just
happened.

00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:36.110
There's a shortage in hard,
red, winter wheat,

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:50.510
so Minneapolis Wheat has gone
from kind of $10 to $24,

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:58.787
now to about $18 or $20,
but in one day it went from $20

00:34:58.787 --> 00:35:05.409
to $24.5--a 22% move in
Minneapolis Wheat.

00:35:05.409 --> 00:35:10.420
Most of the people in the world
had no idea that that had

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:15.519
occurred and it makes absolutely
no difference to them.

00:35:15.519 --> 00:35:22.849
One of the things that's sort
of happening in the world that's

00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:30.420
sort of central to the people
that look at this all the time,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:38.581
but of maybe less direct
relevance to people that have

00:35:38.581 --> 00:35:45.510
everyday jobs,
is that the banking-–more

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:50.485
so than--I mean,
I've been at this for thirty

00:35:50.485 --> 00:35:54.502
years.
In those thirty years,

00:35:54.502 --> 00:36:03.842
there have been lots of mini
crises and violent moves up or

00:36:03.842 --> 00:36:12.859
down--dramatic squeezes or
liquidations--but more so than

00:36:12.859 --> 00:36:19.139
any time in the past thirty
years,

00:36:19.139 --> 00:36:23.699
the banking system is really
closed.

00:36:23.699 --> 00:36:29.750
The big American banks are not
functioning.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:38.102
Their doors are open and people
come and go everyday,

00:36:38.102 --> 00:36:45.010
but they're not really open for
business.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:59.709
They're neither making loans
nor selling the loans they have

00:36:59.709 --> 00:37:11.418
and it's starting--it's
affecting the fringes of

00:37:11.418 --> 00:37:22.630
Corporate America now--not yet
all of it.

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:32.416
And it's what happened in Japan
from '90 to--is it over in

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:35.559
Japan?
Maybe or maybe not.

00:37:35.559 --> 00:37:43.731
They usually talk about it as
the "lost decade," where

00:37:43.731 --> 00:37:51.594
Japanese banks were not
liquidated but they were not

00:37:51.594 --> 00:38:01.527
really in business.
That's happened now primarily

00:38:01.527 --> 00:38:11.440
as the result of losses in,
now all mortgages,

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:19.150
but mortgages and levered
loans.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:37.150
In my view--the Fed has
dramatically cut interest rates.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:43.933
We started from 5% to 3%,
but three-quarters of it--a

00:38:43.933 --> 00:38:48.889
quarter at a time every Fed
meeting,

00:38:48.889 --> 00:38:52.739
which are--Fed meetings are
generally about six weeks apart.

00:38:52.739 --> 00:38:56.948
But then, 1 ¼
of it within a two-week

00:38:56.948 --> 00:39:01.645
period--from 4 ¼
to 3--and they're talking

00:39:01.645 --> 00:39:06.343
about--looks like they'll go
from 3 to 2 ½

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:11.530
whenever the next--when's the
next Fed meeting?

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:18.899
Within a couple of weeks.
The markets are saying they're

00:39:18.899 --> 00:39:22.490
going to go all the way back to
one, which was the low for

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:23.750
short-term rates.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:39.078
To some degree they say their
objective is two-fold:

00:39:39.078 --> 00:39:49.846
to spur economic growth as the
credit crunch slows economic

00:39:49.846 --> 00:39:53.953
activity.
Also, I mean,

00:39:53.953 --> 00:40:00.988
kind of independently or
complimentarily as a corollary

00:40:00.988 --> 00:40:07.632
to that--to free up the
financial system and to help

00:40:07.632 --> 00:40:14.621
financial institutions.
It's kind of my contention that

00:40:14.621 --> 00:40:19.579
it's actually hurting financial
institutions.

00:40:19.579 --> 00:40:27.998
It's actually having the effect
of not letting the markets

00:40:27.998 --> 00:40:33.961
clear.
It's nature--financial--I mean

00:40:33.961 --> 00:40:42.409
that--when I was explaining it
to Professor Shiller,

00:40:42.409 --> 00:40:47.733
he said he didn't quite follow
it, so I probably shouldn't try

00:40:47.733 --> 00:40:55.845
it, and he knows more than I do.
It's a very interesting time in

00:40:55.845 --> 00:41:05.805
that we're having a--we have
consumers under pressure because

00:41:05.805 --> 00:41:16.262
of their overextension of credit
and they're having overpaid for

00:41:16.262 --> 00:41:23.400
houses over the last handful of
years.

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:29.431
We have kind of a slowing
economy either because of that

00:41:29.431 --> 00:41:36.119
or because the economy kind of
slows every once in a while.

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:45.239
We have financial institutions
under stress or duress and,

00:41:45.239 --> 00:41:53.880
unlike the previous time,
we have headline inflation of

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.772
4.3%.
I think it's higher--I think

00:41:59.772 --> 00:42:08.359
lots of economists think it's
lower, but it's--headline

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:16.470
inflation is higher than nominal
interest rates.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:26.265
We have a very weak currency.
The dollar has gone from buying

00:42:26.265 --> 00:42:38.641
a little over 1 Euro to buying
2/3 of a Euro in a couple of

00:42:38.641 --> 00:42:51.137
years and 130 Yen to 100 Yen,
1.5 Australian Dollars to a

00:42:51.137 --> 00:43:00.163
little over 1 and the--and in
that scenario,

00:43:00.163 --> 00:43:09.610
there are more problems than
policy tools,

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:21.601
so any policy action has a
downside, which makes it an

00:43:21.601 --> 00:43:30.870
interesting time.
About half the time.

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:42.085
Questions?
Student: You mentioned

00:43:42.085 --> 00:43:47.309
that things are [inaudible],
do you think that [inaudible]?

00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:52.562
For example,
do you think that mortgage

00:43:52.562 --> 00:43:56.846
[inaudible]
will have a negative

00:43:56.846 --> 00:43:59.505
impression?
Mr.

00:43:59.505 --> 00:44:04.867
Andrew Redleaf: I think
that the question is whether

00:44:04.867 --> 00:44:10.230
markets are more apt to
overprice versus underprice.

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:14.609
Whether they're more
inefficient when things are

00:44:14.609 --> 00:44:18.430
going up or when things are
going down.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:26.050
I don't think I have a systemic
sort of view.

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.775
I mean, lately they've been
more inefficient,

00:44:30.775 --> 00:44:36.789
in my view, because the Fed's
creating too much money.

00:44:36.789 --> 00:44:41.072
In recent years,
there have been more examples

00:44:41.072 --> 00:44:46.877
of things that are priced too
high than things that are priced

00:44:46.877 --> 00:44:52.076
too low,
but there are both and the

00:44:52.076 --> 00:44:58.630
market makes mistakes in both
directions.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:06.489
Student: I actually have
two questions.

00:45:06.489 --> 00:45:09.867
One, do you think an individual
investor should listen to

00:45:09.867 --> 00:45:12.552
Cramer?
Two, what do you think are the

00:45:12.552 --> 00:45:17.050
best ways an individual investor
can make the best return in the

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:19.488
market these days?
Mr.

00:45:19.488 --> 00:45:28.243
Andrew Redleaf: Again,
this is something that I think

00:45:28.243 --> 00:45:36.530
Ben Stein agrees with,
but just about nobody else.

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:43.077
I think for individuals,
instead of thinking of,

00:45:43.077 --> 00:45:51.296
I want to have a portfolio--I
used to have a portfolio and I

00:45:51.296 --> 00:46:00.769
should be invested all the time
and I should divide it up--cash,

00:46:00.769 --> 00:46:05.969
stocks, and bonds--depending
upon how old I am.

00:46:05.969 --> 00:46:10.939
I think people's default
position should be

00:46:10.939 --> 00:46:17.328
cash--individual's default
position should be cash--and

00:46:17.328 --> 00:46:23.244
they should only make
investments if there's really

00:46:23.244 --> 00:46:29.159
a--if they can see a really
compelling case.

00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:39.453
Over the course of time,
fairly compelling cases do come

00:46:39.453 --> 00:46:48.999
up and they're not--and
individuals are in as good a

00:46:48.999 --> 00:46:56.860
position as professionals to see
that.

00:46:56.860 --> 00:47:08.152
So sometime in your lifetime,
stocks, equities as a group,

00:47:08.152 --> 00:47:19.444
will be cheap by most of the
standards that have worked in

00:47:19.444 --> 00:47:25.114
the past.
Professor Shiller,

00:47:25.114 --> 00:47:32.162
in his books,
he's got current multiple of

00:47:32.162 --> 00:47:40.666
trailing ten-year earnings.
Good measure--sort of takes the

00:47:40.666 --> 00:47:47.036
cyclicality out of earnings and
you can see over history how

00:47:47.036 --> 00:47:52.715
that multiple has varied.
You've done very well--you've

00:47:52.715 --> 00:47:58.026
done poorly if--for the most
part, if stocks have done much

00:47:58.026 --> 00:48:03.795
better if you've bought them at
a point that looks cheap on that

00:48:03.795 --> 00:48:07.550
graph than one that looks
expensive.

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:13.377
Sometime in your lifetime,
you'll get an opportunity for

00:48:13.377 --> 00:48:17.510
stocks to look cheap on that
measure.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:20.380
They'll probably,
at the same time,

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:25.024
look cheap on a price-to-book
basis, on a dividend yield

00:48:25.024 --> 00:48:29.500
basis--they tend to move
together--and you can sort of

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:34.543
look at them and say,
equities as a class are cheap,

00:48:34.543 --> 00:48:39.979
I have a compelling reason to
take money out of cash and put

00:48:39.979 --> 00:48:46.679
it into equities now.
I mean, I think a few years

00:48:46.679 --> 00:48:57.320
ago, as the housing bubble was
taking off and going full board,

00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:04.563
as it was easier and easier for
more and more people who

00:49:04.563 --> 00:49:12.071
normally couldn't have bought
houses to go from renting to

00:49:12.071 --> 00:49:16.221
owning homes,
residential REITs,

00:49:16.221 --> 00:49:21.955
apartment house REITs were
again, on obvious historical

00:49:21.955 --> 00:49:24.515
measures,
interesting,

00:49:24.515 --> 00:49:29.086
maybe even compelling.
So, you could buy apartment

00:49:29.086 --> 00:49:33.690
buildings for way less than it
would cost to replace them.

00:49:33.690 --> 00:49:39.395
You could, with public
apartment REITs,

00:49:39.395 --> 00:49:47.953
you could get between a 5% and
9% current income--compound

00:49:47.953 --> 00:49:54.110
interest rates were down at 2%
or 3%.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:50:06.148
That was pretty compelling as
an asset class and worked really

00:50:06.148 --> 00:50:11.114
well.
Municipal bonds right

00:50:11.114 --> 00:50:19.650
now--municipal bonds yield more
than the equivalent

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:28.698
Treasuries--approximately
1.1,1.2 times--that's pretty

00:50:28.698 --> 00:50:32.998
compelling.
The only other time that

00:50:32.998 --> 00:50:36.983
happened was when there was sort
of talk of their losing their

00:50:36.983 --> 00:50:40.119
tax exemptions and tax rates
were going down.

00:50:40.119 --> 00:50:46.762
Tax rates are going up--there's
no talk about losing their

00:50:46.762 --> 00:50:51.190
exemption--that's pretty
compelling.

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:54.507
Professor Robert
Shiller: You said that

00:50:54.507 --> 00:50:58.119
individuals' default investment
should be cash.

00:50:58.119 --> 00:51:02.679
I just want to point out that
contradicts one of our readings.

00:51:02.679 --> 00:51:05.862
Jeremy Siegel,
Stocks for the Long Run,

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:08.550
says the default should be
equities.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:11.517
Am I misunderstanding you or
are you-- Mr.

00:51:11.517 --> 00:51:14.349
Andrew Redleaf: I disagree
with him.

00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:19.524
Ben Stein, I think,
is the only person who sort of

00:51:19.524 --> 00:51:22.682
agrees with me.
He wrote a book,

00:51:22.682 --> 00:51:26.856
Yes You Can Time the
Market, and he sort of

00:51:26.856 --> 00:51:33.984
basically says,
only buy things when you have a

00:51:33.984 --> 00:51:43.550
good reason--a really compelling
reason to own them.

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:51.671
I think--I don't know what he
says about this,

00:51:51.671 --> 00:51:58.889
but I think most of the
equity--to me,

00:51:58.889 --> 00:52:06.746
the historic kind of case for
equities is survivor--is

00:52:06.746 --> 00:52:12.380
U.S.-centric and it's survivor
bias.

00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:17.291
Obviously, the U.S.
went from a kind of average

00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:22.485
agrarian country to the
industrial colossus of the

00:52:22.485 --> 00:52:27.402
world,
so obviously--or as a corollary

00:52:27.402 --> 00:52:32.900
to that--equities did really,
really well.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:48.150
It's not 100% clear that over
the next hundred years that Asia

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:55.229
might not--China,
India, the tigers,

00:52:55.229 --> 00:53:02.863
collectively--might not surpass
us or the world might not do

00:53:02.863 --> 00:53:08.039
that well for the next hundred
years.

00:53:08.039 --> 00:53:10.323
The last hundred years,
in the U.S.,

00:53:10.323 --> 00:53:13.390
don't really have that much
predictive power.

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:21.746
Student: We talk a lot
in this class about trying to

00:53:21.746 --> 00:53:25.290
correlate to the equity premium.
Can you talk a little bit about

00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:28.517
what you see the advantages of
bonds, why you focus so much on

00:53:28.517 --> 00:53:31.744
bonds--getting a little bit away
from the securities--and what

00:53:31.744 --> 00:53:34.760
advantages do you think would
make good investments?

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.459
Mr.
Andrew Redleaf: Here,

00:53:38.459 --> 00:53:44.904
I've convinced some people,
though David Swensen really

00:53:44.904 --> 00:53:52.346
disagrees with me.
If you read his Pioneering

00:53:52.346 --> 00:54:01.646
Portfolio Management on the
syllabus, he really has a

00:54:01.646 --> 00:54:08.865
preference for equities.
What I liked about fixed

00:54:08.865 --> 00:54:15.360
income, I think fixed income is
inherently more analyzable

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:21.443
because you have,
sort of, specified coupons and

00:54:21.443 --> 00:54:28.923
matured--a specified coupon and
a specified maturity and you

00:54:28.923 --> 00:54:34.413
have a fixed income.
Either they pay you or they

00:54:34.413 --> 00:54:40.036
have to reorganize and--they
either pay you interest or they

00:54:40.036 --> 00:54:45.755
have to reorganize and they pay
you principle or they have to

00:54:45.755 --> 00:54:54.570
reorganize.
It's inherently more analyzable.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:55:02.340
Stocks really have to be cheap
because, in general,

00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:10.421
they don't pay out their
earnings and sometime in the

00:55:10.421 --> 00:55:19.900
future they're pretty apt to do
something stupid and you can't

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:24.272
tell.
On the one hand,

00:55:24.272 --> 00:55:33.258
I do think if there's a stock
that is selling for four,

00:55:33.258 --> 00:55:38.222
five,
or six times the earnings and

00:55:38.222 --> 00:55:46.239
you have good reason to believe
that the earnings are going up,

00:55:46.239 --> 00:55:51.089
something's--when a stock sells
for a mid-single digit earnings

00:55:51.089 --> 00:55:55.860
multiple, the market is telling
you that--the market is saying

00:55:55.860 --> 00:56:01.207
that earnings are coming down.
If you have good reason to

00:56:01.207 --> 00:56:07.616
believe that earnings are going
up, if in fact you're right--in

00:56:07.616 --> 00:56:10.446
that case,
when you buy the stock you are

00:56:10.446 --> 00:56:12.380
making a bet on the earnings
going up.

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:17.410
If the earnings go up,
you'll get paid twice because

00:56:17.410 --> 00:56:23.825
the multiple will go up too;
that's sort of the way things

00:56:23.825 --> 00:56:28.284
trade.
When you just--you buy

00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:35.532
something at a--RIM,
the maker of Blackberry,

00:56:35.532 --> 00:56:43.769
sells for fifty,
sixty, seventy times earnings;

00:56:43.769 --> 00:56:51.750
when you buy that stock,
earnings can go up.

00:56:51.750 --> 00:56:55.007
You could think,
I'm buying the stock because I

00:56:55.007 --> 00:56:59.043
think earnings--you have to
think earnings are going to go

00:56:59.043 --> 00:57:03.079
up twelve-fold to get it down to
four times earnings,

00:57:03.079 --> 00:57:05.170
which will take a long,
long time.

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:08.326
They are--if you know earnings
are going to double,

00:57:08.326 --> 00:57:12.114
you really don't know very much
about what will happen to the

00:57:12.114 --> 00:57:15.839
stock price because if they're
going to double over the next

00:57:15.839 --> 00:57:19.084
two years,
hypothetically--if you're right

00:57:19.084 --> 00:57:23.409
on that, it doesn't matter
because the multiple could very,

00:57:23.409 --> 00:57:28.599
very easily go from fifty to
twenty-five.

00:57:28.599 --> 00:57:34.519
So, it's--and in the end,
they'll never pay you any

00:57:34.519 --> 00:57:39.930
dividends.
How do you collect--How do you

00:57:39.930 --> 00:57:47.557
ever collect a coupon?
How do you ever get a hold of

00:57:47.557 --> 00:57:52.893
cash flow?
I just hate owning stocks and I

00:57:52.893 --> 00:57:58.937
love people sending me checks,
which is what a bond--

00:57:58.937 --> 00:58:05.445
Student: Tell us--the
criticisms that I often read

00:58:05.445 --> 00:58:09.397
about in the news media
[inaudible]

00:58:09.397 --> 00:58:13.814
is that in an industry that
[inaudible]

00:58:13.814 --> 00:58:18.579
a service that benefits
society,

00:58:18.579 --> 00:58:22.910
in a sense, hedge fund managers
they [inaudible]

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:28.622
the markets because they have a
better understanding of how the

00:58:28.622 --> 00:58:32.860
world works a lot better than
[inaudible].

00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:46.449
I was wondering how you feel
about that?

00:58:46.449 --> 00:58:51.227
Mr.
Andrew Redleaf: Well,

00:58:51.227 --> 00:59:00.346
I think I--a couple of points.
First, I do think it helps the

00:59:00.346 --> 00:59:07.743
world to have security prices
that are closer to their

00:59:07.743 --> 00:59:16.396
accurate value than further away
and more tending towards their

00:59:16.396 --> 00:59:24.769
fair value over time than
gyrating completely randomly.

00:59:24.769 --> 00:59:31.572
If hedge funds could obsolete
themselves--if hedge funds could

00:59:31.572 --> 00:59:37.593
make markets completely
efficient, it would benefit the

00:59:37.593 --> 00:59:43.230
world a lot--is one.
And to the extent that they

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:49.920
help make markets efficient,
I do think they help the world.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:58.871
I do sort of agree.
I think involved investors also

00:59:58.871 --> 01:00:13.554
improve the performance of the
country's fixed assets and that

01:00:13.554 --> 01:00:22.151
helps the world too.
Hedge fund people aren't--I

01:00:22.151 --> 01:00:29.179
think more and more that'll be a
part of what hedge funds do.

01:00:29.179 --> 01:00:38.022
I mean for--we gave it up,
but we owned Sun Country along

01:00:38.022 --> 01:00:44.773
with the Petters Group,
which is a Minneapolis based

01:00:44.773 --> 01:00:49.679
point-to-point airline--competes
with Northwest.

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:57.111
It was kind of an experiment,
somewhat in behavioral

01:00:57.111 --> 01:01:02.245
economics.
We had distinct ideas about

01:01:02.245 --> 01:01:07.260
what their business strategy
should be.

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:12.536
We couldn't--Petters and
Whitebox actually did not

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:18.996
disagree, but the--Whitebox got
completely disillusioned with

01:01:18.996 --> 01:01:25.349
management and wasn't--so we
sold our stake to Petters.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:34.818
If our ideas were good,
it really would have benefited

01:01:34.818 --> 01:01:46.072
consumers in the Twin Cities and
I do think that people who have

01:01:46.072 --> 01:01:56.969
real money at stake are apt
to--over time and on average,

01:01:56.969 --> 01:02:07.814
their ideas will be better than
people who don't have anything

01:02:07.814 --> 01:02:14.002
at stake.
I mean, activist investors,

01:02:14.002 --> 01:02:22.468
which are mostly hedge funds,
I think often either make

01:02:22.468 --> 01:02:30.621
management better via
competition or on balance their

01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:38.460
ideas are right and they
certainly challenge–

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:47.710
force--management to at least
consider alternatives.

01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:52.992
I think if--I wrote in my last
letter--I just read Paul

01:02:52.992 --> 01:02:58.959
Krugman's book--The New York
Times editorialist--The

01:02:58.959 --> 01:03:04.558
Conscience of a Liberal.
Like a lot of hedge fund

01:03:04.558 --> 01:03:10.420
people, I'm pretty free market,
right-wing conservative,

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:17.879
but I think unlike--hedge fund
compensation is really a market

01:03:17.879 --> 01:03:23.934
result.
It's the result of negotiations

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:33.363
between informed parties of
roughly equal economic clout and

01:03:33.363 --> 01:03:39.226
sophistication.
Executive compensation is not

01:03:39.226 --> 01:03:43.449
the result of arm's length
negotiations.

01:03:43.449 --> 01:03:48.994
There's a new,
I think a Yale study on

01:03:48.994 --> 01:03:56.772
executive compensation.
Something like 96% of Fortune

01:03:56.772 --> 01:04:02.474
500 CEOs get their full
severance package,

01:04:02.474 --> 01:04:10.261
even if they're dismissed for
anything other than a major

01:04:10.261 --> 01:04:13.222
felony.
That they can perform

01:04:13.222 --> 01:04:17.159
badly--they can be found to have
breached their fiduciary duty,

01:04:17.159 --> 01:04:24.097
but they still get a lot,
so I wouldn't--I'm on the hedge

01:04:24.097 --> 01:04:31.530
fund side and against the sort
of company management side.

01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:37.504
Professor Robert
Shiller: Can you tell the

01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:43.820
story of backdating of options?
I started to tell it in class.

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:55.389
Mr. Andrew Redleaf: Sure.
Sort of--the history--when

01:04:55.389 --> 01:05:07.070
bonds are governed by what's
called "an indenture,"

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:11.113
which is the sort of legal
agreement between the company

01:05:11.113 --> 01:05:15.859
and bond holders.
In a typical bond indenture,

01:05:15.859 --> 01:05:22.318
if a company fails to file
financial statements on time

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:29.973
that's an event of default under
their bond agreement and usually

01:05:29.973 --> 01:05:36.073
the remedy for an event of
default is you can demand

01:05:36.073 --> 01:05:43.369
immediate payment--acceleration
and immediate payment.

01:05:43.369 --> 01:05:48.994
We--in general,
people don't read every--people

01:05:48.994 --> 01:05:54.130
own bonds without reading the
indenture.

01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:57.559
They're long,
they're not written in English;

01:05:57.559 --> 01:06:01.409
in most set of circumstances
they are irrelevant.

01:06:01.409 --> 01:06:07.001
So, we actually didn't really
know this until we owned a bond

01:06:07.001 --> 01:06:12.686
in the company that didn't--that
couldn't file their financial

01:06:12.686 --> 01:06:17.434
statements on time.
Somebody else owned them,

01:06:17.434 --> 01:06:22.227
and discovered them,
and demanded that they get

01:06:22.227 --> 01:06:27.125
paid, and ended up negotiating
with the company,

01:06:27.125 --> 01:06:31.514
and we got a kicker.
So, that was kind of our first

01:06:31.514 --> 01:06:34.786
experience--the thing that made
us aware that not filing

01:06:34.786 --> 01:06:37.880
financial statements was an
event of default and,

01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:49.368
therefore, something that would
entitle you to the payment

01:06:49.368 --> 01:06:54.606
immediately.
So, for companies that could

01:06:54.606 --> 01:06:58.059
pay you back,
but their bonds are trading

01:06:58.059 --> 01:07:02.719
below par, probably because they
have a low coupon.

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:08.940
So, if a bond was issued when
interest rates were lower,

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:15.840
they might have a 4% coupon
when the prevailing rate is 6%.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:21.553
So, if it's a four-year bond,
it would trade at about $90,

01:07:21.553 --> 01:07:25.928
so it would be yielding 6%.
But if they default,

01:07:25.928 --> 01:07:30.409
you can buy them at $90 and if
they can't file their financial

01:07:30.409 --> 01:07:33.199
statements, you're entitled to
par.

01:07:33.199 --> 01:07:39.886
We were interested in finding
bonds trading below par where we

01:07:39.886 --> 01:07:46.572
thought there was a chance that
companies would not file their

01:07:46.572 --> 01:07:52.553
financial statements on time.
It turned out at the time,

01:07:52.553 --> 01:07:57.461
one of the big causes of
companies not filing financial

01:07:57.461 --> 01:08:03.460
statements on time was if they
had backdated the stock options.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:06.900
They know what back dating is?
Professor Robert

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:08.053
Shiller: We discussed that.
Mr.

01:08:08.053 --> 01:08:12.051
Andrew Redleaf: If they had
backdated their stock options,

01:08:12.051 --> 01:08:14.869
they'd have to restate their
financials;

01:08:14.869 --> 01:08:18.324
they'd have to
investigate--takes time and so

01:08:18.324 --> 01:08:22.172
forth--and they would delay
filing their financial

01:08:22.172 --> 01:08:26.190
statements.
We tried to identify companies

01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:31.020
that we thought had backdated
their stock options.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:37.267
We bought a database,
we cleaned it up,

01:08:37.267 --> 01:08:46.311
and we basically looked at
their pattern of stock option

01:08:46.311 --> 01:08:56.176
issuance and tried to figure out
the probability of it having

01:08:56.176 --> 01:09:04.493
been caused by chance.
For companies that we thought

01:09:04.493 --> 01:09:11.791
had backdated stock options,
that we could buy their bonds

01:09:11.791 --> 01:09:19.345
at what they would trade for
without this potential event of

01:09:19.345 --> 01:09:24.307
default.
That was kind of a riskless

01:09:24.307 --> 01:09:31.880
trade because if they filed on
time, we hadn't paid anything.

01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:40.628
If they were late,
we had the prospect of getting

01:09:40.628 --> 01:09:43.180
par quickly.

01:09:50.569 --> 01:09:55.080
In the very beginning,
the kind of history--there was

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:59.069
the first trade,
where somebody else discovered

01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:03.753
that a company couldn't file
their financial statements

01:10:03.753 --> 01:10:08.350
because they had bad
recordkeeping or whatever;

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:20.052
that one was not option-related.
That first one was kind of

01:10:20.052 --> 01:10:26.179
happenstance.
The next couple of times,

01:10:26.179 --> 01:10:33.521
companies announced that they
were apt to delay their

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:39.011
financial statements.
The first few times,

01:10:39.011 --> 01:10:45.001
you could buy their bonds at
the same price as before they

01:10:45.001 --> 01:10:50.359
had announced that and
potentially owed you par.

01:10:50.359 --> 01:10:59.136
But that did not–here,
in terms of market efficiency,

01:10:59.136 --> 01:11:07.460
it didn't last forever and
after three or four times,

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:13.188
companies would announce that
they were going to delay their

01:11:13.188 --> 01:11:15.682
filings.
Lo and behold,

01:11:15.682 --> 01:11:22.315
their bonds would go up because
people had discovered that you

01:11:22.315 --> 01:11:28.595
might be entitled to par.
When it stopped working--like

01:11:28.595 --> 01:11:35.624
waiting--we tried to anticipate
what companies might not be able

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:40.310
to file and buy their bonds in
advance.

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:49.873
We gave the SEC our study and
algorithm--they wouldn't tell us

01:11:49.873 --> 01:11:59.279
what they're out--exactly who
they were targeting and how,

01:11:59.279 --> 01:12:06.204
though I got the sense that
their approach was similar to

01:12:06.204 --> 01:12:08.231
ours.
They sort of seemed--even

01:12:08.231 --> 01:12:11.159
though they didn't say anything,
when we were talking to them,

01:12:11.159 --> 01:12:16.150
they seemed sort of pleased
that--when we did something,

01:12:16.150 --> 01:12:20.960
you could see they--when they
were sort of pleased,

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.520
we took that to mean that that
was what they were doing.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:33.210
They were sort of happy or
thinking that that got it right.

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:38.250
As it happens,
so far that we've been

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:46.649
involved, four companies have
argued in court that failure to

01:12:46.649 --> 01:12:54.630
file financial statements is not
an event of default.

01:12:54.630 --> 01:13:03.091
We won the first case,
which we really thought settled

01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:08.421
it.
We've subsequently lost two and

01:13:08.421 --> 01:13:12.490
one is pending.
The wording is slightly

01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:16.026
different in all the indentures,
but in general,

01:13:16.026 --> 01:13:18.810
we've settled eight or nine
cases;

01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:26.850
companies sort of agreed and we
negotiated a settlement.

01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:41.187
In terms of whether hedge funds
are an instrument of social good

01:13:41.187 --> 01:13:55.979
or not, the litigation companies
argue that we're opportunists,

01:13:55.979 --> 01:14:02.149
and we went in and bought more
bonds after they filed late,

01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:10.328
and we haven't been injured,
and it's basically unfair that

01:14:10.328 --> 01:14:19.361
they should have to pay us par.
I did consider this sort of

01:14:19.361 --> 01:14:26.785
noble work because I think
companies should honor their

01:14:26.785 --> 01:14:32.535
agreements.
It's also the case that if a

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:38.546
company paid off their bonds or
settled them,

01:14:38.546 --> 01:14:46.060
they settled it for all
bondholders and not just us.

01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:54.925
If anything,
other bondholders get to free

01:14:54.925 --> 01:15:05.520
ride on us but I think hedge
funds–again,

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:12.899
it's sort of a good thing if
documents and agreement have

01:15:12.899 --> 01:15:19.619
meaning and that requires active
engaged parties;

01:15:19.619 --> 01:15:25.381
otherwise, the party that's
active and engaged will take

01:15:25.381 --> 01:15:26.981
advantage of the other.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.973
- Okay, let's go down memory lane.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.420
- The topic today is an adversary

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.294
that poses a threat, serious threat

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:21.694
to the security of the
United States of America.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.460
This adversary is one of
the world's last bastions

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.460
of central planning, governs
by dictating five-year plans.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.170
With single capital, it attempts

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.820
to impose its command across time zones,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.773
continents, oceans, and beyond.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.770
With brutal consistency,
it stifles free thought

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.053
and crushes new ideas.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.033
Perhaps this adversary sounds
like the former Soviet Union,

00:00:49.226 --> 00:00:50.326
but that enemy's gone.

00:00:52.008 --> 00:00:54.160
The adversary's closer to home.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.450
It's the Pentagon bureaucracy.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.470
We must transform the
way the department works

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.773
and what it works on.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.810
Our challenge is to
transform not just the way

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.600
we deter and defend,
but the way we conduct

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.400
our daily business.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.890
We know the adversary, we know the threat,

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.690
and with the same firmness of purpose

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.890
that any effort against a
determined adversary demands,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.800
we must get at it and stay at it.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.430
Some might ask, how in the world could

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.780
the Secretary of Defense
attack the Pentagon

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.930
in front of its people?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.690
To them, I reply I have no
desire to attack the Pentagon.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.133
I want to liberate it.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.740
We need to save it from itself.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.823
And that means we must recognize
another transformation,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.800
the revolution in management, technology,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.870
and business practices.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.350
Successful modern businesses are leaner

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.150
and less hierarchical than ever before.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.033
They reward innovation,
and they share information.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.870
They have to be nimble in
the face of rapid change,

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.103
or they die.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.173
Business enterprises die
if they fail to adapt.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.870
And the fact that they can fail and die

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.493
is what provides the incentive to survive.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.363
But governments can't die,

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.740
so we need to find other incentives

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.970
for bureaucracy to adapt and improve.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.763
Already, we've made some progress.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.427
We've eliminated some 31

00:02:23.427 --> 00:02:26.380
of the 72 acquisition-related
advisory boards.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.370
We now budget based on
realistic estimates.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.460
We're improving the acquisition process.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.670
We're investing $400 million
in public-private partnerships

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.450
for military housing.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.230
Many utility services to
military installations

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.543
will be privatized.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.950
We have committed $100 million
for financial modernization,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.040
and we're establishing
a Defense Business Board

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.340
to tap outside expertise
as we move to improve

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.253
the department's business practices.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.380
To transform the department,
we must look outside

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.940
this building as well.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.970
Consequently, the senior executive council

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.180
will scour the department for functions

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.940
that could be performed
better and more cheaply

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.710
through commercial outsourcing.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.160
Like the private sector's
best-in-class companies,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.480
DOD should aim for excellence in functions

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.060
that are either directly
related to war fighting

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.360
or must be performed by the department.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.640
But in all other cases,
we should seek suppliers

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.850
who can provide these non-core activities

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.960
efficiently and effectively.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.490
We have brought people on board

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.020
who have driven similar
change in the private sector.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.450
We intend to do so here.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.700
The old adage that you
get what you inspect,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.250
not what you expect, or put differently,

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.820
that what you measure improves, is true.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.603
It is powerful, and we will be measuring.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.660
- So that was Secretary
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.040
in a speech at the Pentagon.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.223
As it turned out, on the
10th of September, 2001.

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:01.953
(audience laughing)
And as you can tell,

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.210
he's elaborating on the agenda
that we've already discussed

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.410
at length in this course
about privatization

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.480
of military functions without any idea

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.883
about what's about to hit the country.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.100
He's not only talking about outsourcing

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.330
and privatizing, but he
really came into the Pentagon

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.020
with a mandate to completely reorganize it

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.040
along management principles
that were deployed

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.140
in the private sector.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.790
And he was busily
setting about that agenda

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.790
in the first months and first
year of the administration.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.860
But, of course, 10 days later,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.753
America was very differently preoccupied.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.190
- Our enemy is a radical
network of terrorists,

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.313
and every government that supports them.

00:04:58.313 --> 00:05:01.313
(audience applause)

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.423
Our war on terror begins with Al-Qaeda,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.123
but it does not end there.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.120
It will not end until every
terrorist group of global reach

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.710
has been found, stopped, and defeated.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.710
(audience applause)

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.030
These terrorists kill
not merely to end lives

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.783
but to disrupt and end a way of life.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.450
With every atrocity, they hope
that America grows fearful,

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.513
retreating from the world
and forsaking our friends.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.363
They stand against us because
we stand in their way.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.203
We have seen their kind before.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.770
They are the heirs of all
the murderous ideologies

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.023
of the 20th century.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.120
By sacrificing human life to
serve their radical visions,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.500
by abandoning every value
except the will to power,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.373
they follow in the path
of fascism, Nazism,

00:06:22.253 --> 00:06:25.800
and totalitarianism, and
they will follow that path

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.590
all the way to where it ends,

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.843
in history's unmarked
grave of discarded lives.

00:06:31.843 --> 00:06:33.780
(audience applause)

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.313
Americans are asking, how will
we fight and win this war?

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.640
We will direct every
resource at our command,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:48.460
every means of diplomacy,
every tool of intelligence,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.790
every instrument of law enforcement,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.860
every financial influence,

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.860
and every necessary weapon
of war to the disruption

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:01.743
and to the defeat of the
global terror network.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.810
Now, this war will not be
like the war against Iraq

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.510
a decade ago with a decisive liberation

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.693
of territory and a swift conclusion.

00:07:14.146 --> 00:07:17.730
It will not look like the air
war above Kosovo two years ago

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:20.040
where no ground troops were used

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.263
and not a single American
was lost in combat.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.440
Our response involves far
more than instant retaliation

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.093
and isolated strikes.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.310
Americans should not expect one battle

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.760
but a lengthy campaign unlike
any other we have ever seen.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:45.970
It may include dramatic
strikes visible on TV

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.223
and covert operations,
secret even in success.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.433
We will starve terrorists of funding,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.383
turn them one against another,

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.700
drive them from place to place

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.870
until there is no refuge or no rest,

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:07.020
and we will pursue
nations that provide aid

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.823
or safe haven to terrorism.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:15.180
Every nation in every region
now has a decision to make,

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:21.330
either you are with us or
you are with the terrorists.

00:08:21.425 --> 00:08:24.330
(audience applause)

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.650
- That was President Bush's
statement to the nation,

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:33.650
the 20th of September, nine
days after the 9/11 attacks,

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.630
and it denounced the advent
of what we have come since

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.560
to refer to as the Global War
on Terrorism, or the GWOT.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.840
And today, this agenda is
gonna be to explore that.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.810
We're gonna talk about what was the GWOT,

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:51.860
and what is it?

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.133
What has it become?

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.100
We're gonna ask how radical
an innovation was it,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.250
and what did it mean for the emerging

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:05.170
post-Cold War international
order that we talked about

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.120
in the very first lecture of the course?

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.420
And finally, I want us to also think about

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.380
as we go through this material,

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.650
what were the paths not taken?

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.100
What might have been done differently

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.410
that might leave us in
a different position

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.143
than we are today?

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:32.360
Let's think back to the 1991 Gulf War

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.310
that I lectured about at
the beginning of the course.

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.850
And particularly, George
Herbert Walker Bush,

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:43.933
Bush 41, as some like to call him,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.010
what strategy he pursued
when Saddam Hussein

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.763
invaded Kuwait in December of 1990.

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.020
And this strategy of pursuit
had a number of elements.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.690
One was that it was fully authorized

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:03.830
through the UN Security Council.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.170
Resolutions were passed admonishing

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.150
Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait,

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:12.610
which he ignored and
eventually stonewalled

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.760
but refused to comply with.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.760
Secondly, the Bush 41 Administration

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.450
put together a very large
and diverse coalition,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:30.330
which included participants
with many different

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:36.080
geostrategic interests,
including every Arab nation

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:40.263
except Jordan participated
in that coalition.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.500
They stuck to the limited authorized goal

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.120
of expelling Saddam Hussein from Kuwait

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.080
and made no effort at
regime change in Iraq.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.330
This is something for which
Bush was heavily criticized

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.920
by neoconservatives in the US.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.763
We'll hear more about
neoconservatism next week.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.870
And many people thought he
was being too much of a wimp

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.103
and that once you had half
a million troops there,

00:11:12.103 --> 00:11:16.150
that he should have gone
all the way to Baghdad

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.760
and interestingly, Dick Cheney,

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.330
who was in that administration,

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.640
came out as a strong defender

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.660
of not doing that, partly on the grounds

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.810
that we wouldn't know
what, we wouldn't be able

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:35.670
to manage the system,
the situation thereafter,

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.280
this philosophy that if
you break it, you own it,

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.600
which, again, we will
attend to more next week.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:49.600
But it was this basic idea
that Bush was operating on of,

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:55.220
that I like to call stop the
bully without becoming a bully.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.370
Then the notion was that if people engage

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.290
in aggression across borders,

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.620
the international
community will stop them.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.620
But it was consistent with
the UN Charter's commitment

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.330
to the maintenance of
international peace and security,

00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:17.930
which is a line in the UN Charter,

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.410
which we saw has come to be questioned

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.920
subsequently with the implementation

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.920
of responsibility to protect, for example.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.770
But at the time, it was seen
as a sacrosanct commitment

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.270
of the UN, essentially to protect

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:40.580
the status quo of the division
of the world into nations.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.760
And so you stop aggression,
but you don't engage

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.710
in regime change, and you don't rearrange

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:48.643
the global geography.

00:12:50.317 --> 00:12:52.820
Over this and the next two lectures,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.860
I want people to think
about one counterfactual.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.240
This is not the only one,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.470
but what if that had become the template

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:03.890
for facing down international aggression

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.780
in the post-Cold War world?

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.460
And that was clearly
part of Bush 41's agenda.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.540
He wanted to etch these norms

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.370
into accepted common law
practice if you like,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.930
of international conduct
and also the notion

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.930
that they should all be mediated
through the United Nations.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.100
Another way of putting it is that he had

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:33.590
a kind of containment sensibility,

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.390
George Herbert Walker Bush.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.130
The idea was to contain aggression,

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.970
not to solve the world's
problems, not to end bad regimes,

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.210
but to contain aggression,
to stop aggression.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.900
And of course, the word
containment has a long history.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.490
It goes back to the Cold War,

00:13:53.490 --> 00:13:56.290
and I wanna take us back
through that history

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.860
because it's really only
by having some sense

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.330
of that history that we
can evaluate the extent

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:08.260
of the departure that comes
with the Global War on Terror

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.480
a decade after Bush, Sr. was doing this.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.850
If we think back, the idea
of containment, of course,

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.527
was articulated by George Kennan in 1946

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.680
in something which was
called the long telegram.

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.260
He was in Moscow at the time as part

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.850
of the Truman Administration.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.240
And it was published
subsequently anonymously

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.630
with the authorship X as a document

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.080
in "Foreign Affairs" the next year,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.540
it called the Sources of Soviet Conduct.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.110
And this is the classic statement

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.673
of the original idea of containment.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.780
And it had a number of elements to it,

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.810
the original doctrine of containment,

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.670
as conceived by Kennan.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.460
Kennan, first and foremost,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.140
he was a staunchly anticommunist,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.290
very conservative and indeed held views

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.770
about race and other matters
which would not endear him

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.343
to many people in this room.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.100
Be that as it may, this was
his view of the Soviet Union.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.960
He thought it was, first of all,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.030
fundamentally antithetical
to Western democracy,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.340
and he thought the enterprise
of getting involved

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.280
in public debates with the
Soviets about capitalism

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.950
versus communism and the desirability

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.123
of different systems, was
a total waste of time.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.410
There was no possibility of dialogue,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:51.390
and he didn't advocate, he
thought it was just pointless

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.610
and indeed, might give propaganda
victories to the Soviets

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.950
in the developing world
during the Cold War.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:04.950
But secondly, he was absolutely
unequivocally convinced

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.530
that the Soviet Union was unsustainable,

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.410
that it was a flawed economic
system for the reasons

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.410
that we know well, that command
economies don't really work,

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:23.500
and that eventually it would develop

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.800
the kinds of problems
that it eventually did.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.060
But then secondly, and actually in this,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:35.680
he was stating something
that has since become

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.230
conventional wisdom among
political economists

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.380
who study international relations,

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:46.380
he was convinced that the Soviet
Union's hegemonic ambitions

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.510
would bankrupt them, that
as they sought to become

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.680
a hegemonic power, they would
be spending more and more

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.980
sustaining that hegemony, and eventually

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.980
it would drive them to ruin.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.050
And as I say, it is
conventional wisdom now

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.600
in the international relations field,

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:12.140
made famous by people
like Stephen Krasner,

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.170
Robert Keohane, and others
that hegemonic powers

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:21.170
become overextended and
eventually find it very difficult

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:25.693
to sustain the financing
of their hegemony.

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.600
Kennan was contemptuous
of all political science

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:32.810
and social science.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.800
He wouldn't put it in those terms, but

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:42.750
his seat-of-the-pants judgment
was that this was a system

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.113
that was just gonna
drive itself off a cliff.

00:17:48.933 --> 00:17:51.000
Then what should the US do?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.300
And here, Kennan's view was,

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.890
well the US should forget
about the governments

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.740
in the Soviet Union and really focus

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:06.500
its attention on the populations
behind the Iron Curtain,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.900
essentially to win the
battle for hearts and minds.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.880
The thought was that as these systems

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.720
became more and more dysfunctional,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.800
people would be more and more dissatisfied

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.240
and then it would be
important, first of all,

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.580
for them to see successful
models elsewhere.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.280
And so he thought it was hugely important

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:32.210
to rebuild the American
domestic economy at home

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.520
and to invest in rebuilding
Western Europe and Japan,

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.993
so a huge supporter of the Marshall Plan,

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.580
no doubt partly because of commitment

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.630
to the West European countries,

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.130
but from the point of view
of his containment doctrine,

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:52.080
the idea was that as the
populations behind the Iron Curtain

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.610
experienced increasing levels of poverty

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:58.880
and disaffection from their regimes,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:03.880
they would see on television
and learn about in other ways,

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.783
the thriving democratic
systems in the West.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.490
The other side of that
coin was he very much

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.480
wanted to admonish, first and foremost,

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.680
the Truman Administration,

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.603
but subsequent American administrations

00:19:23.603 --> 00:19:26.980
and Western governments, not to start

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.580
to become like the Soviet Union.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.380
We needed to not behave in ways

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:38.380
that would make us seem
to be their moral equal.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:43.640
We should, therefore, maintain
civil liberties at home

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.480
and in our international conduct.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:48.430
We shouldn't engage in adventurism.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:49.920
Essentially, our goal should be

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.210
about containing Soviet aggression.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.680
And he thought the principle
means of doing that

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.463
would be economic and diplomatic.

00:20:00.918 --> 00:20:05.270
He was opposed to the
formation of NATO, for example.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.770
He thought creating NATO
would just militarize

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:12.210
the confrontation between
us and the Warsaw Pact,

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.040
and if we created NATO, the
Soviets would do something

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.653
comparable on the other
side, which they did.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.363
He opposed the Vietnam War.

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.620
This is much later, of course,

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.620
but again, on the theory
that this is about something

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.740
more aggressive than containment.

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:39.030
The Vietnam War was
motivated by a domino theory

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.920
that if Vietnam was allowed to fall,

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:47.650
then the whole of the
rest of Southeast Asia

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.443
would go communist, none of
which turned out to be true.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.190
And he was, part of the reason that he

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.160
was opposed to Vietnam
War was quite prescient,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:01.920
which is that if, in his mind,

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.480
if you are fighting a war of choice

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.877
against an enemy for whom
it's an existential war,

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:14.500
unless you can have a very
quick, cheap, easy victory,

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.230
as when Ronald Reagan invaded Grenada

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:21.290
or something of that
order, basically the cards

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.820
are stacked against you because you're not

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.130
gonna be able to sustain support at home

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.100
for a war of choice.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.710
Whereas your adversary isn't fighting

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.620
for their very existence,
and so they will be able

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.240
to sustain support.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.040
So he was very skeptical of conflicts

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:47.040
like the Vietnam War, which he
thought was a giant mistake.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.450
That was classical containment doctrine

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.220
as articulated by Kennan.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.713
And it didn't get very far.

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.860
Indeed, he rapidly got into conflict

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.820
with the Truman Administration.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.990
And the Truman Doctrine,
as I've already intimated,

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.860
was revolved around
militarizing the standoff

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:14.810
with the Soviets in ways
that Kennan didn't like.

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:18.080
And this was laid out in a document

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:22.480
called the NSC 68, published in 1950.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:24.110
Many scholars call it

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.810
the most important US strategic statement

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.777
of US principles during the Cold War,

00:22:30.777 --> 00:22:33.410
and it was essentially laid out

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.180
what's come to be known
as the Truman Doctrine.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:42.180
And it supported the creation of NATO,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:45.550
and it supported a much
more aggressive stance.

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:48.120
Now, some scholars still
call it containment,

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.137
so John Lewis Gaddis in his excellent book

00:22:51.137 --> 00:22:52.950
"Strategies of Containment",

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.360
calls this a different
kind of containment.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.890
And I don't have anything
invested in the terminology,

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.800
but it's a much more militarized
version of containment

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.290
than Kennan originally envisaged.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.970
For Kennan, military
force should always be

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.640
a strategy of last resort, not
a strategy of first resort.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.290
You try everything else first,

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.260
and you only use it, you use it sparingly

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.760
to stop aggression when you have to.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.840
Even during the Truman Administration,

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.650
Kennan had all this conflict,

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.810
and eventually he stormed off in a huff

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.040
to the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.470
where he spent the next several decades,

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.210
occasionally throwing spitballs

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.603
at one administration after another.

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.843
He became a grumpy old man of sorts.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.520
But, of course, the Truman Administration

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.350
was just the beginning of the Cold War.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.820
And then we had the
Eisenhower Administration,

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.260
and the Eisenhower Administration took

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.920
a more militaristic view
of US foreign policy

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.570
than even the militarized version

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:16.010
of containment that was
embedded in the Truman Doctrine.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.600
And so, the Eisenhower
comes to power in 1952.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.860
The Cold War's ramping up.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:27.110
McCarthyism is ramping up.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.600
And proponents of containment get accused

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.590
of being proponents of appeasement,

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.600
that this is all about appeasement.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.740
And, of course, appeasement
is actually giving in

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.530
to foreign aggression in the way

00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.480
that the British and French did

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.940
when Hitler was beginning
his expansionist policies

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.440
and then accepting them.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:56.740
Containment is not, it's not that.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.600
Containment says you do respond

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:00.770
to actual attempts at aggression.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.360
But short of that, you
don't involve yourself

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.513
in trying to rewrite
global political geography.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:16.790
And so, John Foster Dulles
who was the John Bolton

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.790
of his era, you might say, he
was the proponent of rollback.

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.340
And rollback was to not accept

00:25:26.784 --> 00:25:30.400
the disposition, particularly of Europe,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.550
after the Iron Curtain came down,

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.660
and that he thought we
really needed to push back

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.090
against the Soviet Union
much more aggressively

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.690
than any notion of
containment would suggest.

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:48.690
And indeed, Eisenhower ran on
rollback in the 1952 election

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:52.620
saying that they would take

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.520
a much more aggressive,
anticommunist stance

00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.463
than the Truman Administration had done.

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.460
Interestingly enough,
of course, at that time,

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.760
the Truman Administration was bogged down

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.920
in the Korean War, which
Eisenhower promptly

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.920
negotiated a settlement to
after not very long in office.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.480
But, in any event, they ran on rollback,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.340
and, of course, something like rollback

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:26.490
was became a much more dominant theme

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:29.980
if we think about the
Johnson Administration

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.290
during Vietnam and Nixon.

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.550
Nixon's strategy became more complicated

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:37.280
than just straightforward rollback

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:42.280
because he wanted to, actually
in true Kennanesque fashion,

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.980
he wanted to exploit divisions
among communist regimes.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.290
That's part of what the
opening to China was about,

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:54.160
but nonetheless, in
prosecuting the Vietnam War,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.160
at least as he did and in
the era before detente,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:05.480
he was something of hawk with
respect to the Soviet Union.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.803
That was rollback, and interestingly,

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.493
when we think about, we
look back on the Cold War,

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:23.330
despite what Eisenhower ran in in 1952

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.780
and what Dulles came
into the State Department

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:30.460
attempting to do, he
found a lot of pushback

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.910
against rollback in the State Department

00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.790
and found that many people were actually

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:41.790
more convinced, if not of
Kennan's version of containment,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.380
at least they were convinced

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.370
of the Truman Doctrine's version of it.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:51.300
In Europe, the US largely did stick

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.220
to containment as its policy.

00:27:54.220 --> 00:27:56.840
They didn't really their to rollback

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.720
the frontiers of the Soviet empire.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:03.140
And if you look at where
they did try to rollback

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.930
the frontiers of the Soviet empire,

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.667
such as in Iran where there
was an election in 1953

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.890
and a pro-Soviet government was elected,

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.310
we went in and toppled that government

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:19.230
and basically implanted the Shah.

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.290
Didn't turn out that well.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.590
We engaged in rollback in Vietnam.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.163
Didn't turn out that well.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.100
By the end of the Cold War, containment

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.050
and indeed Kennan was
given a lot of credit

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:36.203
as a policy that had actually worked.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:39.600
Of course, where that
containment would have worked

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.610
in the absence of NATO is a question

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.803
to which we'll never have an answer.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:49.320
Whether it was the
Kennanesque version of it

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.510
or the Truman Doctrine version of it,

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:56.240
nonetheless, it was given great credit,

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.750
partly because the early predictions

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.020
had turned out to be right.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.200
The economy was unsustainable,

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.660
and the Soviet Union did
indeed become bankrupt,

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.360
partly because of Reagan's Star Wars,

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.360
which spent them, created
not just an arms race

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.777
for space weapons, but a dollars race.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:27.020
And then, of course, very
relevant to today's discussion,

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:32.370
they got embroiled in an
unwinnable war in Afghanistan,

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.120
which turned out to be
the Soviet's Vietnam,

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.480
interestingly, also
motivated by a domino theory.

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:44.170
The Soviet belief was
that if the Mujahedin

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.850
succeeded in Afghanistan, this would allow

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:53.830
Islamic fundamentalism to start working

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.180
its way through the Asiatic republics

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.750
of the Soviet Union, and
it had to be stopped.

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:03.740
Of course, when the dominoes
finally started falling,

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.170
it was in Western Europe,
and it had nothing

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.433
to do with Afghanistan.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.423
George Herbert Walker
Bush's policy in 1990,

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:21.760
the first Gulf War, is really
a version of containment

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.810
as mediated through
international institutions.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:27.760
Kennan was a hard-boiled realist,

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.630
and so he had no time for the UN

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.170
and part of the reason
he had no time for NATO,

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.880
by the way, was, again,
his hard-boiled realism,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.507
he said, "No nation is gonna
bind itself by an alliance,

00:30:39.507 --> 00:30:42.810
"if it's not in their interest to do it."

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.330
It's either gonna be
irrelevant when it's needed

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.200
or window dressing when it's not.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.027
But he also thought no nation was gonna

00:30:51.027 --> 00:30:52.810
pay any attention to the UN.

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:55.780
So that aspect of Kennan's thinking

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.590
is not part of the post-Cold
War containment idea

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:05.320
that Bush was working to entrench

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.320
in the way that he responded
to the first Gulf War in 1991.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.160
Now, let's come to Bush
43's Global War on Terror

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:27.390
and what came to be called the
Bush Doctrine very rapidly.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:33.010
And we can see what we
think about how it contrasts

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.263
with what had gone before.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:40.290
The first feature of the Bush Doctrine

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.840
is that he envisages it as
being worldwide in scope.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.057
He says, "We will strike anywhere,

00:31:46.057 --> 00:31:48.727
"and we reserve the
right to strike anywhere

00:31:48.727 --> 00:31:53.240
"if there is a threat to
our national security."

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:57.770
Now, of course, America's
assertion of unilateral rights

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:00.920
to strike perceived threats that were not

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.010
to the American mainland
has a long history.

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:08.770
In fact, goes back to 1823
when John Quincy Adams

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.580
articulated what came to
known as the Monroe Doctrine;

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.600
although, it didn't actually get named

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.670
the Monroe Doctrine until
some decades later in 1850.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:24.350
But it was the Monroe
Administration asserted

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:29.350
that any European interference anywhere

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.390
in Latin America would be conceived of

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:37.870
and responded to as a threat
to the national security

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:39.160
of the United States.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:44.160
And so, essentially, during
the Monroe Doctrine said

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:48.083
that we control the hemisphere,

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.870
and anybody who interferes
in the hemisphere

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:58.870
is interfering with
America's national interests,

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.160
and we will respond with force.

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.600
That was aimed at the
Europeans in the 19th century,

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.650
but it is the precedent, if you like,

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.810
to the extent there is a precedent

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.830
for George W. Bush asserting,

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.970
we will act militarily
anywhere in the world

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:21.110
if our national security is threatened.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.200
And indeed, interestingly, he talked

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.200
about the Axis of Evil,
Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.420
And of course, in those days,

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:34.560
Iraq was not an Islamic administration.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.560
It was a secular Baathist
regime, run by Saddam Hussein.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.770
Iran was an Islamic state,

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:46.100
and North Korea was communist state.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:51.020
And so he was, by putting
those three together

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.200
as the Axis of Evil, he
was doing two things.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.840
One was he was saying, and this was

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:01.740
the Bush Administration's
position until 2006,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.350
that is not about Islamic fundamentalism.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.870
That terrorism is, and he was very careful

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:13.870
not to attack the idea of
Islamic fundamentalism.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.320
The War on Terror was
not just about Islam.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:22.320
It changes that rhetoric after 2006,

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:29.080
but also, that we would
act anywhere in the world.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.470
And if you think about Phnom Penh,

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:36.170
it's 12 time zones away from
east coast United States,

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.610
so the only way you could get further away

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:40.929
would be by blasting off into space.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.314
(audience laughs)

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:47.000
Now, we've taken the
Monroe Doctrine worldwide.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:54.083
Secondly, we asserted the
right to act unilaterally,

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:59.660
unconstrained by any existing alliances

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.010
and unconstrained by what
international institution

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.290
might or might not authorize.

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.110
And indeed, this is where
he coined the phrase,

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:10.110
coalitions of the willing.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.730
We will put together coalitions

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.240
on a opportunistic basis if necessary

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:20.930
to fight our adversaries.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:24.110
And indeed, as I mentioned
to you in an earlier lecture,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:29.090
one of the reasons so many
East European countries

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:32.407
were added to NATO in the 2004 and 2005

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:37.900
was it was the quid pro
quo for their promise

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.540
to participate in the Iraq invasion

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.680
that I'll be talking about next week.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.980
We can act unilaterally with allies

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.053
that are willing to
form coalitions with us.

00:35:52.335 --> 00:35:55.250
We're not constrained, either by alliances

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.313
or by international institutions.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:04.320
Third, he asserted a right
to engage in preemptive war.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.050
The traditional justification of war

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:10.650
was the existence of an imminent threat.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.630
Word imminent has a long history.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.463
It's partly connected to just war theory,

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.240
which says that an imminent
threat is necessary

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:24.700
for war to count as a just war.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.913
And if you go back and
actually read the NSC 68,

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.100
the statement of the Truman Doctrine

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.770
published in 1950, it asserts there

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:42.313
that the US will never
engage in preemptive war,

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:45.913
that it's only gonna act defensively.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:52.120
Very quickly, the Bush
Administration said, no.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.210
We are not gonna be constrained

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:56.520
by the doctrine of imminent threats.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.820
And they started talking about
things like emerging threats,

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.500
gathering threats, would be sufficient

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:08.123
to justify American military action.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.270
And of course, if you
think about that doctrine,

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.560
a doctrine of emerging threats,

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:18.410
you then are almost inevitably

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:21.220
also gonna get away from the idea

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:23.860
that we're only getting involved

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:26.380
in wars of existential survival.

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:30.227
You're gonna be back in
the world of optional wars

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:37.350
because there's no clear
sense in which emerging

00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:42.370
or gathering can be neatly calibrated

00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:46.390
or that you can convince your citizenry

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.670
of the importance of an
emerging or a gathering threat.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.380
That's part of what we
have with global warming.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.360
It's a gathering threat.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.340
It's an emerging threat.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.010
You can't, much harder to mobilize people

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.823
for a chronic problem, if
you like, than a crisis.

00:38:01.899 --> 00:38:06.170
Eminent war was thrown out of the window

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:10.493
in favor of these notions
of gathering threats,

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.010
emerging threats, and so on.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:18.820
Again, we can engage in preemptive wars

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:21.783
against emerging or gathering threats.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.150
In that Bush doctrine,
as he articulated it,

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.500
first at West Point commencement address

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:33.850
in June of 2002 and then reiterated it

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.090
in two national security
statement doctrines

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.080
that the Bush Administration published,

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:44.080
one later that year and
then reaffirmed in 2006.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.540
They said, a legitimate war
aim was now regime change.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.020
A legitimate war aim was to get rid

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.620
of an oppressive dictatorship.

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.750
Completely out of the window,

00:38:55.750 --> 00:39:00.210
the UN notion that international action

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:04.180
is legitimate if its goal is to restore

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:09.740
the status quo ante of
an international borders,

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:14.510
but simply if a regime is
sufficiently oppressive,

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:17.150
vis a vis its own population,

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.230
this will be a justification
for military action.

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:26.620
And the reason they
articulated this so early

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.430
was they already had their eye on Iraq.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.920
It was very clear, for reasons
we'll get to next week,

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.100
that from the beginning,
the administration

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:41.100
was committed to removing
Saddam Hussein from power

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:46.630
even before we had started
the battle in Afghanistan.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.650
A fifth element of the Bush Doctrine was,

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.270
again, a very radical departure,

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:57.870
which was that there's no
possibility of neutrality.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.007
As he put it at the end
of the clip I showed you,

00:40:02.007 --> 00:40:06.160
"if you're not with us,
you're with the terrorists."

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.500
And of course, there had
been a long tradition

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:12.530
of neutrality in international relations.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:17.530
If you go back to the
US in the 19th century,

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.380
we had often asserted neutrality,

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.300
and if you come even
into the 20th century,

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:29.000
if you look in the run-up to World War II,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.100
Congress was passing
neutrality legislation

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:37.090
hand over fist to keep FDR
out of the war with Germany

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.510
in the late 1930s.

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:42.010
So there was a long tradition of the US

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.770
asserting the right to be neutral
in international conflicts

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.300
and during the Cold War,
the non-aligned nations

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:54.290
had declared themselves to be neutral

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:58.203
in the conflict between
the US and the Soviets.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:04.800
Once we get to the Bush Doctrine,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.890
all of that also goes out of the window.

00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:12.630
Essentially, we're now
declaring to the world that

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:17.630
if you do not support
us, we will feel free

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:23.180
to interpret that as
support for our adversaries,

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.593
and we will act accordingly.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:33.020
Finally, the Bush Doctrine,
as he indicated in that clip,

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.890
envisages, if not permanent war,

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:42.890
a war that we can never really
say has finally been won.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.100
We're declaring war on terror.

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.120
Well, there's been terrorism in the world

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.903
since the beginning of time.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.520
And so the idea that you're now gonna be

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.670
on a war footing so long
as there is terrorism

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:58.910
in the world, you're essentially saying

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.643
the US economy is gonna be
on a permanent war footing.

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:09.040
We're gonna be engaging in what
have since come to be called

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:14.040
endless wars into the indefinite future.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.600
Some have said that the Bush Doctrine

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:23.160
was not that radical of an
innovation, but clearly it was.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.980
It was much more radical than anything

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.470
that had gone before.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:33.410
And it, of course, what it did was

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.860
as it has played out, and we'll see this

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.990
in the next two lectures, it completely

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.730
rubbished his father's attempt to re-embed

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:52.730
some notion of containment
for a post-Cold War era

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:55.410
into international politics,

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.230
and it's one reason his father

00:42:57.230 --> 00:43:00.710
was very critical of him and
of Cheney and of Rumsfeld

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:05.680
for, if you like, scuttling his legacy.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.720
And this came out in a
subsequent biography.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.540
In effect, the Bush Doctrine,

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.480
if you wanted a bumper sticker for it,

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:18.570
is rollback of all possible adversaries

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.500
at any time and in any place.

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.873
The US now asserts the right to do that.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.290
It was about as radical an innovation

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:33.600
as one could have come up with.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:36.320
And certainly, the most radical innovation

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.030
in US national security policy

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.553
in the history of the republic.

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.803
Now, let's turn to the Afghan conflict.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.750
One question is, well, why was Al-Qaeda

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.670
based in Afghanistan in the first place?

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:56.833
And you already know.

00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.653
Why were they there?

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.810
They just popped up.

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:10.140
Osama bin Laden had a long
and antagonistic history

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:15.140
of not very good relations
with his Saudi government.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.260
He was a Saudi Arabian citizen,

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.363
and he had become radicalized and had,

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:28.050
in the 1980s, worked with the Mujahidin

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:32.300
in Afghanistan, helping
them battle the Soviets.

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.140
And when the Soviet
Union finally collapsed,

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.030
he had tried to mediate an end

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:40.660
to the ongoing war in Afghanistan

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.500
among the militias, not with much success.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:48.160
He had been bounced around the Middle East

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.343
and eventually wound up in Sudan.

00:44:56.010 --> 00:45:00.868
During the invasion of
Kuwait by Saddam Hussein

00:45:00.868 --> 00:45:04.060
that I was talking about some minutes ago,

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.440
he was strongly of the opinion

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.760
that the Saudis, first
of all, in that war,

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:12.840
part of the reason there
was so much anxiety

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.490
about Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait,

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:18.910
was people thought Saudi
Arabia will be next.

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:23.910
And Saudi Arabia is a huge
supplier of oil to the West,

00:45:24.350 --> 00:45:26.550
so there's both the Saudis themselves

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.520
and others is part the reason
there was Arab participation

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.173
in the coalition to get
Saddam out of Kuwait.

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:40.070
Bin Laden said that on no
account should the Saudis

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:45.070
accept Western participation
in expelling Saddam Hussein

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:50.370
from Kuwait, and if they did,

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.690
they would be inviting the infidel

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.670
into the heart of the Middle East.

00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:59.180
And they ignored him, and then he kept up

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.850
a steady stream of attacks
on the Saudi regime

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:09.700
in print and verbally and
was increasingly suspective

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.220
also of even financing terrorist attacks

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.370
in Saudi Arabia from his bases in Sudan

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:20.333
and elsewhere that he moved around to.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:24.670
The Saudis finally,
they first banished him

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:26.310
from the country and then stripped him

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.613
of his Saudi citizenship.

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.160
I think that was in 1994
they had stripped him

00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.500
of his citizenship, and eventually,

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.950
they started putting pressure on Sudan

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:43.510
to kick him out of Sudan
because they thought he was,

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:46.580
an ambassador to the Americans
think he was using this

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.630
as a base for mounting terrorist attacks,

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:52.093
which were ramping up over the 1990s.

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:57.690
Finally, the Saudis agreed
and everybody agreed

00:46:57.690 --> 00:46:59.450
that they would leave him alone

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.700
if he would go to Afghanistan,

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.740
and there was a sort of
tacit acknowledgement

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.960
that he would not foment terrorism

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.960
within Saudi Arabia from that base.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:17.460
But as Al-Qaeda became
increasingly radicalized,

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:22.010
we should remember that
their two primary war aims

00:47:22.010 --> 00:47:24.380
were, first, to overthrow
the Saudi regime,

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:28.490
and secondly, to get the
West out of the Middle East.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:32.500
It was what they, at that
time, called a defensive jihad,

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:35.040
rather than an offensive jihad,

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.893
which they had subsequently embraced.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.446
That's why he was in Afghanistan.

00:47:43.446 --> 00:47:46.340
And that's why the 9/11 attacks

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:48.150
were plotted from Afghanistan.

00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:51.830
He had good relations
with the Taliban regime

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:52.690
of Mullah Omar.

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:55.823
They had worked together
there in the 1980s.

00:47:58.610 --> 00:48:03.370
An important thing to
say about the Afghan war

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:06.040
is we very early on made a decision

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.010
to pursue regime change.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.540
Basically, what happened
was we went to the UN,

00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:14.920
we said, we got resolutions passed saying

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.940
the Taliban must turn over Osama bin Laden

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.750
and close down the training camps.

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:23.400
They refused, and we essentially said,

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.683
we're gonna wipe you out.

00:48:25.519 --> 00:48:28.583
We're gonna take over your regime.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.860
But, and here, this is part of the reason

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:35.310
I showed you the Rumsfeld clip

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:36.780
at the beginning of the lecture,

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.630
it turns out that when Rumsfeld said,

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.160
we'll contract out everything

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.763
except core military capacities,

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:48.380
that was not an accurate statement

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.540
because the Bush
Administration was certainly

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.090
not interested in growing the military.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:59.230
Indeed, Rumsfeld was
shrinking the military.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:01.813
And they had no intention
of changing that.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:05.510
They wanted to attack Afghanistan,

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:09.830
and they wanted to do it
largely by contracting out,

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:13.010
not to military contractors
as we talked about

00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:17.050
in the privatization lecture,
that would come later.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.780
But they thought the way to do this

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:24.780
since Afghanistan was in
the midst of a civil war,

00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:27.700
the way to do this was to get behind

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.860
one of the belligerents in the civil war

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.130
and let them take over the country,

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.533
and then they will be friendly regime.

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.910
The belligerent in question was a group

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:42.840
called the Northern Alliance,

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:47.840
and the Northern Alliance
was losing the war.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:51.463
They had been pushed into a
small corner of the country,

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:57.350
and but for us, involvement with them

00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:00.650
and support for them, they
would almost certainly

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:05.650
have been defeated in
relatively short order.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:11.080
What we did was we got
behind the Northern Alliance

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.230
and supported them in
the Afghan civil war,

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:19.183
which led then to the
destruction of the regime,

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.700
which was in two important respects,

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:26.390
a setup for failure for two reasons.

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.950
One is the theoretical expectation,

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:31.120
maybe it's dressing it up too much

00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:33.590
to call it theoretical, but at least,

00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:35.630
one should have skeptical priors.

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.183
If you get behind the
losing side in a civil war,

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.630
the odds are its gonna be very difficult

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:45.570
for them to govern if
you put them in power

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:48.760
because one of the reasons
they're the losing side

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.330
in a war is they probably don't have

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:53.420
much grassroots support on the ground.

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.630
And we will see this
play out again in Libya

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:00.243
and elsewhere in upcoming lectures.

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.200
There were good reasons
for skepticism of the idea

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:09.220
that this was a good way to
put in a puppet government

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:12.090
that would be friendly to the US

00:51:12.090 --> 00:51:13.850
and be able to govern the country

00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:19.560
without massive infusions of support.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.330
And, of course, nobody anticipated

00:51:24.330 --> 00:51:29.010
for a second that we would
make Marshall Plan type

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:34.010
of investments in
Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002.

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:38.220
The notion we were gonna
sustain the rebuilding

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:41.160
of this country was not
on anybody's scanner,

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.053
and indeed, as we have
subsequently tried to do it,

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:48.540
that has been a dramatic failure.

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:51.450
There was no postwar planning of any kind.

00:51:51.450 --> 00:51:55.440
This was in the heat
of the weeks after 9/11

00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.440
and the notion was that this horrific evil

00:52:01.890 --> 00:52:04.570
has been perpetrated
against the United States,

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.560
and we're gonna go there
and take care of business!

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:12.560
I mean, that was the dominant
rhetoric behind this invasion.

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:19.013
One question to ask is,

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:24.500
might we have done any
of this differently?

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.850
Was there a path not taken here?

00:52:26.850 --> 00:52:31.530
Clearly, we, as I said in the chapters

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:36.530
I had you read today, the
idea of responding to 9/11

00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:41.450
through the lens of the
criminal justice system

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:45.600
was a complete nonstarter
given the scale and scope

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.720
of the attacks, and there was gonna be

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.350
a military response.

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.840
And it was also clearly the case that

00:52:51.840 --> 00:52:55.780
once the Taliban regime
refused to be cooperative,

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.963
there was gonna be military action.

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:00.850
Well, there was a path not taken

00:53:00.850 --> 00:53:03.760
advocated by some at the time.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.340
And this is summarized
by Lawrence Wilkerson

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:12.290
who was Colin Powell's chief of staff.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.877
In an interview in "The
Cairo Review" five years ago,

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:20.357
he said, "The smart strategy,

00:53:20.357 --> 00:53:22.900
"and there were those who
advocated this at the time,"

00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:24.380
and he's correct about that.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.993
You can find it in the archival evidence.

00:53:28.337 --> 00:53:31.297
"Was to go in, pound the
hell out of Al-Qaeda,

00:53:31.297 --> 00:53:33.897
"try to get bin Laden and his leadership.

00:53:33.897 --> 00:53:35.167
"If you didn't, so be it.

00:53:35.167 --> 00:53:36.567
"You'd keep hunting.

00:53:36.567 --> 00:53:40.177
"You'd do it mostly with
special ops forces and the CIA.

00:53:40.177 --> 00:53:42.427
"You would pound the Taliban a little bit,

00:53:42.427 --> 00:53:43.693
"and as you left you'd tell them,

00:53:43.693 --> 00:53:46.157
"'Do it again, and we'll do it again.'

00:53:46.157 --> 00:53:48.637
"This was very formidable, persuasive,

00:53:48.637 --> 00:53:51.833
"strategic brief, and the
president rejected it."

00:53:51.833 --> 00:53:55.367
Then he says in a rather mean aside,

00:53:55.367 --> 00:53:57.840
"Well, really the vice
president rejected it."

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.450
Because it was common knowledge

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:04.320
that Cheney was really the brains behind

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:08.020
and certainly the energy behind the war

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:10.173
as it was being fought.

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:16.400
What would have been the advantages

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.390
of such an approach?

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:19.960
Essentially you would ignore the Taliban.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.060
You would say, we've been
attacked by these people,

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.440
and we're gonna go after them,

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.670
and we are going to destroy them.

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:29.200
And if you interfere with us,

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:33.000
good luck with that because
we will beat you up, too.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.480
And they need not have
engaged in regime change,

00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.470
particularly if you're
thinking about a world

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:41.640
in which you're gonna be acting

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:43.350
with a light footprint and wanting

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:47.880
to keep your forces available
for deployment anywhere,

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:51.260
seems like it might be a way to go.

00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.023
Obviously, first of all, much cheaper,

00:54:55.445 --> 00:54:58.563
vastly cheaper than replacing a regime.

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.500
You finance your operation,
and then when you leave,

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.410
you leave with your operation.

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:09.410
Secondly, it avoids the you
break it, you own it problem.

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:12.120
If you create a failed state,

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:17.030
you are then saddled with a failed state,

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:19.630
and you've gotta administer a failed state

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.510
or at least support some side

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:24.723
that's trying to
administer a failed state.

00:55:26.535 --> 00:55:28.780
By toppling the regime,

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:33.130
we took on a much bigger set of problems.

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.810
Now some might say, well,
what about the costs

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:38.920
in terms of deterrence,
that you want other players

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.200
around the world to know that

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:48.700
if they support terrorists
or allow terrorists

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.730
in their country, they're
gonna be wiped out, too?

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:55.250
That might have been some of the thinking,

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:58.850
but I suspect the real
reasons it was not done,

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:01.040
first of all, the raids after 9/11,

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:05.940
the idea that in the weeks and
months following that attack,

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:10.430
the notion that Mullah Omar's
regime was thumbing their nose

00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:15.100
at the US, was just too much to bear

00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:17.793
and too much politically to tolerate,

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.210
as well as hubris about what

00:56:22.210 --> 00:56:24.360
could be achieved in Afghanistan.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:28.570
And here, we tend

00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.550
to repeat the mistakes of history.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:33.780
You didn't have to go
back to the 19th century

00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:37.980
and Britain's failed attempts
to subdue Afghanistan.

00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:39.890
The Americans had watched in real time

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:44.820
for a decade as the Soviets
had been ground down

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.530
in the Afghan mountains.

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:49.800
It's about the worse
possible terrain in the world

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:52.333
for military campaigns.

00:56:56.188 --> 00:56:59.140
It's not really surprising perhaps

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.623
that we didn't pursue that path,

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.510
but certainly, there
were people on the ground

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:09.323
advocating it, and it's
something that we didn't do.

00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:14.120
What did we do, apart
from toppling the regime?

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:18.370
What did we do in going after bin Laden?

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:21.910
And what we did came
to a head in December,

00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:24.793
in northeastern Syria in what,

00:57:26.730 --> 00:57:29.760
in northeastern Afghanistan, in these,

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:32.780
very high up in the
mountains in a remote area

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:36.300
called Tora Bora, the Battle of Tora Bora,

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:41.300
which was conducted over the
middle of December of 2001.

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:48.710
And here's some commentary
from a key player

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:50.683
at the Battle of Tora Bora.

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.760
- [Scott] Following
the strategy of keeping

00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.966
an Afghan face on the war,

00:57:55.966 --> 00:57:58.820
Fury's Delta Team joined the CIA

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:02.900
and Afghan fighters and
piled into pickup trucks.

00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:04.330
They videotaped their journey

00:58:04.330 --> 00:58:06.830
to a place called Tora Bora.

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:10.151
Fury told us his orders
were to kill bin Laden,

00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:13.130
and leave the body with the Afghans.

00:58:13.130 --> 00:58:14.880
- Right here, you're looking at,

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.150
basically the battlefield
from the last location

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:19.710
that we had firm on Osama
bin Laden's location.

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:22.400
- This ridge line, is
it about 14,000 feet?

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.400
And back this way toward me is Pakistan.

00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.233
- [Dalton] That's right.

00:58:25.233 --> 00:58:28.600
- On a scale of say, one to
10, 10 being the toughest,

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.946
how tough a position is this to attack?

00:58:31.946 --> 00:58:34.340
- (laughs) In my experience, it's a 10.

00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.760
- [Scott] Delta developed
an audacious plan

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.270
to come at bin Laden
from the one direction

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:41.219
he would never expect.

00:58:41.219 --> 00:58:43.050
- And we wanna come in on the back door.

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:45.190
- You were gonna come up
over the tops of the peaks?

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:47.540
- That's right, the original
plan that we sent up

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.750
to our higher headquarters,
Delta Force wants to come in,

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:52.800
over the mountain with oxygen,

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.020
coming from the Pakistan
side, over the mountains

00:58:55.020 --> 00:58:57.330
and come and get a drop
on bin Laden from behind.

00:58:57.330 --> 00:58:59.120
- Why didn't you do that?

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.430
- Disapproved at some level above us,

00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:03.710
whether that was central command,

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:05.140
all the way up to the
President of the United States,

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:05.973
I'm not sure.

00:59:05.973 --> 00:59:08.570
- [Scott] The next option,
Delta wanted to employ

00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:10.770
was to drop hundreds of land mines

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:13.950
in the mountain passes
that led to Pakistan,

00:59:13.950 --> 00:59:15.850
bin Laden's escape route.

00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:17.180
- First guy blows his leg off.

00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.510
Everybody else stops.

00:59:18.510 --> 00:59:20.910
That allows aircraft
overhead to find them.

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:22.170
They see all these heat sources out there.

00:59:22.170 --> 00:59:24.820
Okay, there's a big large
group of Al-Qaeda moving south.

00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:25.890
They can engage that.

00:59:25.890 --> 00:59:27.000
- Why didn't you do that?

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:27.833
- Disapproved.

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.630
- [Scott] Why was it not approved?

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:31.513
- I have no idea.

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:35.470
- How often does Delta come
up with a tactical plan

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:38.170
that's disapproved by higher headquarters?

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:42.120
- In my experience, in my five
years at Delta, never before.

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.470
- The military wouldn't tell us

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:46.040
who rejected the plans or why.

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:48.170
Fury wasn't happy about it,

00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:51.550
but he pressed on with the
only option he had left,

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:55.600
a frontal assault on bin Laden's
dug in Al-Qaeda fighters.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.430
The Delta Team had only about 50 men,

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:01.460
so the mission would depend
on the Afghan militia

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.670
as guides and muscle.

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:08.670
Their leader was a warlord, a
self-styled general named Ali.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:12.720
Ali, second from the left,
met with this CIA officer

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.740
and accepted millions of
dollars in cash from the agency.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.530
Dressed like Afghans,
the Americans maneuvered

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:23.110
up the mountains, calling
in airstrikes on Al-Qaeda.

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:26.210
By day, they would advance, but at night,

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:31.030
they soon discovered that
their Afghan allies went home.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:34.700
Well, I have to assume
that if you started up

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.410
the hills of Tora Bora, and
the Mujahedin took territory,

01:00:39.410 --> 01:00:41.580
they didn't abandon that at night.

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:42.510
- Oh, yes, they did.

01:00:42.510 --> 01:00:43.740
- They gave it up to the enemy?

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.680
- Absolutely, the Mujahedin, would go up,

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:47.750
get into a skirmish, a firefight,

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:50.350
lose a guy or two, maybe
kill an Al-Qaeda guy or two,

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:51.500
and then they'd leave.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:52.850
It was almost like it was an agreement,

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.230
an understanding between the
two forces fighting each other,

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:58.090
almost, put on a good
show, and then leave.

01:00:58.090 --> 01:01:00.540
- [Scott] In the morning,
bin Laden was on the radio.

01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:04.930
The CIA, Delta, and their
Afghan allies were listening.

01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:07.260
How did the Afghans react when they heard

01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:09.193
from Osama bin Laden on the radio?

01:01:11.107 --> 01:01:14.407
- Osama bin Laden is many a Muslim's hero.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:19.810
These guys, in my
opinion, were more in awe

01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:23.190
of Osama bin Laden than they
were willing to kill him.

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:25.280
When they heard him talking on the radio,

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.560
they would gather around the individual

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.260
that handheld that transistor.

01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.870
He would hold it up in the air,

01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:32.400
almost as if he didn't want
the connection to break,

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.230
and almost like they
could see the ridge line

01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:35.780
Osama bin Laden happened
to be talking from,

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.660
like they could almost see
him and feel his presence.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:40.390
And they just stood there with wide eyes

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:44.490
and somewhat in awe that here
is a leader of the jihad,

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:46.300
the leader of Al-Qaeda,
and they're actually

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:47.920
hearing his voice over the radio.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.870
- And these were the men who
were supposed to help you

01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:51.963
capture or kill him?

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:53.753
Some allies.

01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:58.190
And then, something
extraordinary happened.

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:00.460
Fury's Afghan allies announced

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:04.220
that they had negotiated
a ceasefire with Al-Qaeda,

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.930
something the Americans
had no interest in.

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:09.210
When Fury's team advanced anyway,

01:02:09.210 --> 01:02:13.210
his Afghan partners drew
their weapons on Delta.

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:16.780
It took 12 hours to end
the bogus ceasefire,

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.393
precious time for Al-Qaeda to move.

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:23.000
You gotta figure he's
heading for the valley

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.900
and to pass into Pakistan.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.297
- Our assumption is he's going
for the valley at that time.

01:02:27.297 --> 01:02:29.830
- [Scott] Bin Laden had changed direction

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:32.500
and the tone of his radio calls.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:35.940
- Clearly under duress, clearly hurting,

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:37.940
clearly caring for his men.

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:40.150
- [Scott] Inside this
building, the American team

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:42.360
listened to bin Laden on the radio.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.560
Fury wrote down the
translation in a notebook.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:49.377
- Quote, "Our prayers were not answered.

01:02:49.377 --> 01:02:52.367
"Times are dire and bad.

01:02:52.367 --> 01:02:54.827
"We did not get support from the apostates

01:02:54.827 --> 01:02:56.477
"who are our brothers.

01:02:56.477 --> 01:02:57.957
"I'm sorry for bringing you here.

01:02:57.957 --> 01:03:00.860
"It is okay to surrender," end quote.

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:03.543
- When you heard that, what did you think?

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.460
- I thought, it's almost over.

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.423
- So Dalton Fury is a pen name.

01:03:12.696 --> 01:03:14.410
He has a book, actually several books

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:16.870
called "To Kill bin Laden".

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:20.170
He was the major in
charge of the Delta Forces

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:23.833
in the Afghan operation.

01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:29.980
And you can read his book if
you want the detailed account.

01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:33.560
But basically what happened at Tora Bora

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.233
has been much in dispute.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.080
An important document which
gives a lot of the blow by blow

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:45.080
is this Senate report, foreign
relations Senate report

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.493
published in 2009,

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.920
which documents a lot of what Fury

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.960
said in that clip and that basically

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.200
that the US, it's not the
only thing, by the way.

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:07.670
Some might be skeptical of this if you see

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:10.640
who was chairman of the
committee at that time.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:15.640
And he had failed in his 2004
bid to unseat George W. Bush;

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.440
though, he was not involved
in writing this report.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:23.423
But another, around the
same time, an academic,

01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:30.280
you can read this abstract at your leisure

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.017
when I post the slides,
basically they said

01:04:33.017 --> 01:04:37.300
there was an alternative path not taken,

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:42.300
not just the two strategies
that Fury was suggesting,

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:46.210
feeding up the command
that didn't wanna hear him,

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:49.820
but that there were
even within the ceiling

01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:54.480
of 10,000 troops, even
within that ceiling,

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.680
there were battle plans
to go into the mountains

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.680
and at least seal off
the escape to Pakistan,

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:05.490
and they didn't do it.

01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:10.490
Instead, there was a lot of hand-wringing

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.020
about whether, first of
all, there were claims

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.040
that we didn't know he was there for sure,

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.770
which turned out to be false.

01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:21.140
The CIA did know that
he was there for sure.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.820
And then they thought that
maybe he had been killed,

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:26.380
and they spent some time
digging up for bodies.

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.333
But he hadn't been killed.

01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:33.700
The strategy had essentially been

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:37.090
to rely upon these militias

01:05:40.445 --> 01:05:43.290
whose loyalty was very much in question.

01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:46.560
And of course, we shouldn't
be surprised by that,

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:49.560
not only for the reasons Dalton Fury gave

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.890
in that video, that they might have had

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.750
much stronger allegiance,
many of those people

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:59.423
to bin Laden than to the
prospect of killing him,

01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:03.880
but also because we
know from the literature

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.380
on civil wars, here
the state of the art is

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:12.380
Stathis Kalyvas's work, used
to be at Yale, now at Oxford,

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:16.740
but civil wars are never
just about ethnic conflicts.

01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:21.300
There are all kinds of other
local interests served.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:23.920
And as we saw in the
Host Nation Trucking case

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.100
we talked about some time ago,

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.830
people are being paid and making money

01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:31.850
in these kinds of settings.

01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:36.190
And so it's very unlikely
that you're gonna be able

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:41.190
in a setting like this
to outsource the fighting

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.253
against somebody like bin Laden.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:48.343
What explains the American strategy?

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.250
Well, one is that we wanted to keep

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:53.820
the troops to a minimum.

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.600
As I said, there have been
subsequent studies done,

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.060
both by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:06.060
and academic studies
which make it believable,

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:10.240
at least obviously there's always risk

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.240
in any military operation,
but there's a colorable case

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:18.480
that the US could have gone in

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.510
with troops that were in the region

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:24.073
and prevented bin Laden's escape.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:30.200
It seems like a principal reason was that

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.750
what has become so important
in American wars abroad,

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:39.220
they wanted to keep the number

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.060
of US casualties to a minimum.

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:45.120
As you saw, there were only
some 50 Delta Force people

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.470
up there in the mountains
working with the Afghans.

01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:52.280
They did not want
Americans to start hearing

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:55.970
about dead soldiers in Afghanistan.

01:07:55.970 --> 01:08:00.010
But then, secondly, it is
also clear from that report

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:04.710
that they were already
in December of 2001,

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:09.710
President Bush was asking
Rumsfeld for a battle plan

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:16.130
to go into Iraq and remove
Saddam Hussein from power.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:21.200
And they did not want to
get a lot of American troops

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.043
embroiled in any kind of
conflict in Afghanistan.

01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:29.690
So the thought was they
were gonna be redeploying

01:08:29.690 --> 01:08:32.320
whatever assets they had in Afghanistan

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.660
as soon as possible to Iraq.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:36.493
Now, you might think about, well,

01:08:36.493 --> 01:08:39.303
what were the costs of this strategy?

01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:43.640
One was the obvious, immediate cost,

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.910
that bin Laden and Al-Qaeda
escaped through the mountains

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:50.640
to Pakistan, which gave them
a huge propaganda victory

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.370
against the US, that the most
powerful nation on Earth,

01:08:54.370 --> 01:08:57.430
in fact, couldn't chase
down this terrorist group

01:08:57.430 --> 01:09:00.950
in the mountains of Afghanistan.

01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:04.240
But secondly, also because
we had such a weak footprint,

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:06.570
actually Mullah Omar himself escaped

01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:09.000
on a motor bicycle, motorcycle

01:09:13.094 --> 01:09:15.487
from Afghanistan into Pakistan

01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:20.200
and would come to lead
the Taliban insurgency

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:25.200
to retake the country from
the new regime in Kandahar,

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.020
so much so that within a
year, American generals

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:34.460
on the ground were saying
up the chain of command,

01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:37.570
you should negotiate a
deal with the Taliban

01:09:37.570 --> 01:09:41.800
because the new regime's not
gonna be able to survive.

01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.200
And here we are 18 years later,

01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.110
and I believe we're on
the verge of doing that.

01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:51.423
But they were saying it as early as 2002.

01:09:54.630 --> 01:09:59.100
And finally I think that
what the Afghan operation

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:03.980
did do, though it was gonna take some time

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:06.160
for this to become clearer,

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.240
it made it obvious the that
gap between the aspirations

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:14.690
for and the capacities
behind the Bush Doctrine

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:17.680
were becoming, it should
say doctrine on that slide,

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.870
the Bush Doctrine, were
coming clearly into view,

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:25.870
because if you think about
the massive expansive reach

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:30.820
that we proclaimed, we'll
wage preemptive wars

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.670
against gathering threats
anywhere on the world

01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:38.670
at any time with any
allies, at the same time,

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:43.660
as we're shrinking our
military capacities,

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:48.190
extremely unwilling to get
American soldiers killed

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:51.190
and wanting to work through proxies,

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:53.580
that this is not gonna end well.

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.570
It didn't end well in Afghanistan,

01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:59.453
and next Tuesday, we'll
see how it ended in Iraq.

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:01.463
See you then.

01:11:01.463 --> 01:11:03.553
(people milling)

01:11:03.553 --> 01:11:06.303
(peaceful music)

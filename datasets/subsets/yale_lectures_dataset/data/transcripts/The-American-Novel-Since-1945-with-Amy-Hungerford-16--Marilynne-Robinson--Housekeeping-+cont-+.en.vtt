Professor Amy
Hungerford: Today is Novel

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.740
Pitch Day.
Does everyone have a ballot?

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.910
If you don't have a ballot,
there are some down here.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.323
We have a wonderful list of six
novels, all brought to you by

00:00:16.323 --> 00:00:18.310
students from this class.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.562
I'll tell you,
my dream is that one day

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:27.720
someone will pitch their own
novel.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.430
That's my dream,
and yeah, this could happen.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.840
Yes.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:49.760
Okay. Are you ready?
Ballot? Here you go.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.490
So, without further ado,
is everybody ready?

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.562
Now, each of these students has
been given five minutes only to

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:06.768
make their presentation,
and at the end of it you will

00:01:06.768 --> 00:01:10.640
rank your top three choices,
1 for your first choice,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.510
2 for your second choice, 3.
The TFs will take your ballots.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.022
They will leave the room.
I will begin to lecture on

00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:23.370
Housekeeping, and
when they've added it all up,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.934
which should go pretty fast
because there are nine of them

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:31.328
and they're very good at adding.
You have to know that to get in

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:34.110
to the Ph.D.
programs here.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.310
There is a little arithmetic
test.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.810
They will add it all up,
and then I will announce at the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.420
end of the class which book it
will be.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.262
So, without further ado,
Emma Barash will come and talk

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:48.980
to us.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.435
Emma: Well,
thank you, Professor

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:06.121
Hungerford.
I'm Emma Barash,

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:10.480
and I am pitching Giovanni's
Room by James Baldwin.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.187
So, what is Baldwin like?
Well, Baldwin is one of the

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:17.939
great twentieth-century American
authors, and he has some really

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.916
unique insights into human
interaction and a shrewd

00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:24.430
sensitivity into the internal
lives of his characters.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.930
His background kind of shines
through his prose.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.683
He is the son of a preacher,
so his words have this really

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:33.120
strong, sort of,
grandness to them,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.490
and there's a really,
really unique resonance to

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.954
everything he writes.
Anyway, so Baldwin,

00:02:39.954 --> 00:02:43.679
in my opinion,
isn't read as often as he

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:49.388
should in academic settings,
so I chose this book because I

00:02:49.388 --> 00:02:54.520
wanted to use this opportunity
to read Baldwin at Yale.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.813
And a nifty little fact about
Giovanni's Room:

00:02:57.813 --> 00:03:01.639
It's about 150 pages.
Yeah.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.386
And, it's eminently readable,
so that's a big plus at the end

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:07.166
of the semester.
But also,

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.692
I didn't just choose
Giovanni's Room because

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:12.322
it's short.
I chose it because it fits

00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:15.931
seamlessly with our syllabus.
So, what's Giovanni's Room

00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:18.203
about?
Well, Giovanni's Room is

00:03:18.203 --> 00:03:20.733
the story of David,
a twenty-something man who

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:23.770
flees America to Paris in hopes
of finding himself.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.223
While in Paris David finds a
fiancé,

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:30.595
Hella, and, in her absence,
another lover,

00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:33.956
Giovanni, a man.
So, the novel spirals around

00:03:33.956 --> 00:03:36.469
David's reverie on one
particular evening,

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.860
the evening of Giovanni's
execution.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.481
I don't want to ruin any more
of the book, so I'll let you

00:03:42.481 --> 00:03:45.340
wonder what offense Giovanni has
committed.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.786
Now, Giovanni's Room
fits with the notion of the

00:03:47.786 --> 00:03:50.505
Identity Plot which Professor
Hungerford was discussing a lot

00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:53.206
last week,
but here the identity problem

00:03:53.206 --> 00:03:56.982
is founded in sexuality,
a fascinating issue which the

00:03:56.982 --> 00:04:00.830
literature we've studied so far
has yet to explore.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.246
So, Giovanni's Room
complicates the Identity

00:04:04.246 --> 00:04:07.252
Plot further,
but Giovanni's Room also

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:11.458
explores national identity.
It is an American novel of

00:04:11.458 --> 00:04:14.349
expatriotism,
an American in Paris.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.466
So without further ado I want
to read a passage in which David

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:22.649
realizes his alienation from
America and from American-ness.

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:27.720
So, here he is walking into the
American post office in Paris to

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.721
pick up his mail:
Yet walking into the

00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:33.344
American Express office one
harshly gray midsummer

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:36.328
afternoon,
I was forced to admit that this

00:04:36.328 --> 00:04:40.461
active, so disquietingly
cheerful horde struck the eye at

00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:42.939
once as a unit.
At home I could have

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.985
distinguished patterns,
habits, accents of speech with

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:48.600
no effort whatever.
Now, everybody sounded,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.771
unless I listened hard,
as though they had just arrived

00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:54.117
from Nebraska.
At home I could have seen the

00:04:54.117 --> 00:04:56.579
clothes they were wearing,
but here I only saw bags,

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:00.321
cameras, belts and hats--all
clearly from the same department

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:02.399
store.
At home I would have had some

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:05.449
sense of the individual
womanhood of the women I faced.

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.675
Here, the most ferociously
accomplished seemed to be

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:12.279
involved in some ice-cold or
sun-dried travesty of sex,

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.300
and even grandmothers seemed to
have had no traffic with the

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.449
flesh.
And what distinguished the men

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.709
was that they seemed incapable
of age.

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:21.781
They smelled of soap,
which seemed,

00:05:21.781 --> 00:05:24.888
indeed, to be their
preservative against the dangers

00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:27.629
and exigencies of any more
intimate odor.

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:30.510
The boy he had been shone
somehow unsoiled,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.420
untouched, unchanged through
the eyes of the man of sixty,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.850
booking passage with his
smiling wife to Rome.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:41.154
His wife might have been his
mother forcing more oatmeal down

00:05:41.154 --> 00:05:44.568
his throat, and Rome might have
been the movie she had promised

00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:47.611
to allow him to see.
Yet, I also suspected that what

00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:51.000
I was seeing was but a part of
the truth, and perhaps not even

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.829
the most important part.
Beneath these faces,

00:05:53.829 --> 00:05:56.689
these clothes,
accents, rudenesses was power

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.873
and sorrow,
both unadmitted,

00:05:58.873 --> 00:06:02.946
unrealized, the power of
inventors, the sorrow of the

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:08.269
disconnected.
Okay. All right.

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:11.610
Here you see that miserable
sense of separation,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.808
that confusion,
that hopelessness that Baldwin

00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:16.927
crafts,
that loss of identity,

00:06:16.927 --> 00:06:20.514
and perhaps you can begin to
see the beauty and the might of

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:24.040
his language which molds such a
powerful story of love,

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.950
of loss, and--most
importantly--of self.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:35.584
Okay. Thank you.
Professor Amy

00:06:35.584 --> 00:06:36.620
Hungerford: All right.
Kelsey, where are you?

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.550
There you are.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.339
Kelsey: Hello.
I'm Kelsey, and the book that

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:50.566
I'm pitching is One Flew Over
the Cuckoo's Nest by Ken

00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:52.676
Kesey.
It is about a certain insane

00:06:52.676 --> 00:06:55.987
asylum, and the narrator is a
six-foot-seven schizophrenic

00:06:55.987 --> 00:06:58.660
deaf mute Indian chief named
Chief Bromden,

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.246
whose life is turned upside
down by a brutal and hedonistic

00:07:02.246 --> 00:07:05.050
man named Randall McMurphy.
And Ken Kesey,

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.092
who I need to talk about a
little bit, was sort of a rock

00:07:09.092 --> 00:07:11.493
star.
He was to the hippie generation

00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:14.199
what Jack Kerouac was to the
Beat generation.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:18.420
He was an era's most outspoken
proponent of LSD.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.018
He and his Merry Pranksters
went on the road in their Magic

00:07:22.018 --> 00:07:24.189
Bus touting it across the
nation.

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:27.059
One road trip that he took in
1964 with Neal Cassady,

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:30.370
the same Neal Cassady who Dean
Moriarty was crafted after,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.375
was written down in a book by
Tom Wolfe called The Electric

00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:35.740
Kool-Aid Acid Trip 
so he has that,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:38.170
sort of, in common with Jack
Kerouac.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.259
And I'd like to play a little
clip that I have from a BBC

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:44.460
interview with Kesey about LSD's
effects on his writing.

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:54.071
Oh, just some background
information: While he was

00:07:54.071 --> 00:07:57.514
writing One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, he was

00:07:57.514 --> 00:08:00.350
working in a mental institution.
[Announcer:]

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.792
Kesey's experiences at the
hospital inspire him to write a

00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:04.720
novel, One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.540
He claims the drugs
enhanced his creativity.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.107
[Kesey:]
I would have not been able to

00:08:11.107 --> 00:08:15.453
write that well without LSD.
I could see a reality with a

00:08:15.453 --> 00:08:19.817
new light shining on it,
and it goes right through your

00:08:19.817 --> 00:08:24.694
eyes to your fingertips.
Taking acid was a shortcut to

00:08:24.694 --> 00:08:29.339
enlightenment that we were given
in this century,

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:35.207
for those of us who would like
to go on to better realities and

00:08:35.207 --> 00:08:39.330
understand and respect and say,
"Okay.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.214
The door has been opened.
This is the key that opened

00:08:42.214 --> 00:08:43.960
it."
Kelsey: Okay.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.916
So, the door that Kesey opens
in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's

00:08:48.916 --> 00:08:53.629
Nest reveals the inner
workings of an insane asylum.

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:56.062
This, of course,
draws attention to the one most

00:08:56.062 --> 00:08:58.804
obvious, and also most
complicating theme of the book,

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.182
that of madness.
We've touched on the theme of

00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:03.728
madness before with Lolita
and with Franny and

00:09:03.728 --> 00:09:05.637
Zooey,
 but I don't think we

00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:08.440
have addressed it as explicitly
as we would with this book.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.539
The book is set in an insane
asylum.

00:09:10.539 --> 00:09:13.379
There is no way to avoid
insanity.

00:09:13.379 --> 00:09:15.890
At first glance that might seem
like a very straightforward

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.560
assertion.
However, the very sense of

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.950
omnipresent madness in the book
is one that, I think,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.990
ropes this book very neatly
into the argument of Professor

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.618
Hungerford's syllabus.
I think it's an intensification

00:09:25.618 --> 00:09:27.444
of most of the themes we've
studied so far,

00:09:27.444 --> 00:09:30.194
for example the Identity Plot.
I think it's a very unique

00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:33.226
manifestation of the Identity
Plot, because the people in the

00:09:33.226 --> 00:09:36.309
insane asylum are perhaps one of
the most isolated groups that

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:39.865
you could possibly be a part of.
They're isolated by their own

00:09:39.865 --> 00:09:42.945
neuroses, the tyranny of the
nurses and a barricade of

00:09:42.945 --> 00:09:45.269
concrete, plexiglass and barbed
wire.

00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:48.061
I think if you imagine any
attempt to find yourself within

00:09:48.061 --> 00:09:51.059
the confines of a sanitorium,
you can sort of see how

00:09:51.059 --> 00:09:54.019
interesting a story would be
crafted on that.

00:09:54.019 --> 00:09:56.532
Another theme that we have
talked about is the relationship

00:09:56.532 --> 00:09:59.366
between language and experience.
We talked about that with John

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:02.037
Barth, and I think that's a
really important question to

00:10:02.037 --> 00:10:03.877
focus on,
when you're reading a book like

00:10:03.877 --> 00:10:06.351
this, because you have to think
to yourself as you're reading:

00:10:06.351 --> 00:10:08.542
how does an author accurately
capture the experience of

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:10.149
insanity,
and, more importantly,

00:10:10.149 --> 00:10:12.935
how can we as readers trust a
narrator that's self-diagnosed

00:10:12.935 --> 00:10:15.215
as insane?
And, in that same vein:

00:10:15.215 --> 00:10:18.620
what is truth,
and how does one portray truth?

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.129
I'd like to read a passage from
the book.

00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:23.969
This is at the very beginning,
when we're first introduced to

00:10:23.969 --> 00:10:27.680
the Chief, and he decides that
he is going to begin telling

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.182
about all this:
â€¦about the

00:10:30.182 --> 00:10:31.830
hospital, and her,
and the guys,

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.962
and about McMurphy.
I've been silent so long,

00:10:33.962 --> 00:10:35.888
now it's going to roar out of
me like flood waters,

00:10:35.888 --> 00:10:38.200
and you think the guy telling
this is ranting and raving.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.692
My God, you think this is too
horrible to have really

00:10:40.692 --> 00:10:42.572
happened.
This is too awful to be the

00:10:42.572 --> 00:10:44.977
truth, but, please,
it's so hard for me to have a

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:48.425
clear mind thinking on it,
but it's the truth even if it

00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:51.782
didn't happen.
So, I think you can see the

00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:55.820
confusion that can arise from
having an insane narrator.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.161
One of the most enticing
aspects of this book is that it

00:10:58.161 --> 00:11:00.335
is funny.
There are extremely hilarious

00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:03.043
aspects of this book.
I don't know if any of you have

00:11:03.043 --> 00:11:05.140
seen the movie,
or at least that famous clip of

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.009
Jack Nicholson laughing like a
maniac.

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:09.821
The movie, in general,
doesn't do the book justice at

00:11:09.821 --> 00:11:11.389
all, whatsoever,
of course.

00:11:11.389 --> 00:11:14.551
But I think that one moment is
quintessentially Ken Kesey,

00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:17.824
and he uses humor as his most
powerful tool in conveying his

00:11:17.824 --> 00:11:20.210
deep and serious messages in
this book.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.478
One thing that I want to
point out is,

00:11:22.478 --> 00:11:25.244
there is this really
fascinating thing that happens

00:11:25.244 --> 00:11:27.899
over the course of this book,
and it's this.

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:29.879
There is an X that frames the
plot.

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:33.335
And that X: one arm is the
Chief's ascension from insanity,

00:11:33.335 --> 00:11:36.850
and the other arm is McMurphy's
descension into insanity.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.331
And I think,
if we choose this book,

00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:40.700
one of the most challenging
aspects of our analysis of it

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:43.240
will be to find where the two
slopes of those intersect.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.425
Just to wrap up,
I think that this book is

00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:48.409
absolutely phenomenal,
and it's completely engrossing.

00:11:48.409 --> 00:11:50.789
My own introduction to it was
completely random.

00:11:50.789 --> 00:11:53.145
It was one of the books that my
roommate happened to throw into

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:55.312
her suitcase before she came to
Yale, and I read it at the

00:11:55.312 --> 00:11:57.138
beginning of the year.
I took it with me to my

00:11:57.138 --> 00:11:59.253
grandparents' over a weekend,
and I didn't sleep the entire

00:11:59.253 --> 00:12:00.997
weekend 'cause I was reading it.
And I think,

00:12:00.997 --> 00:12:03.099
if you choose this book,
each and every one of you will

00:12:03.099 --> 00:12:04.950
be equally as enthralled.
So, I hope you pick it.

00:12:13.789 --> 00:12:19.356
Professor Amy
Hungerford:

00:12:19.356 --> 00:12:26.000
Miranda.Miranda:
Hi.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.090
I'm pitching Joan Didion's
Play It As It Lays.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.621
Joan Didion is,
in my mind, one of the greatest

00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:35.659
intellectuals of the second half
of the twentieth century.

00:12:35.659 --> 00:12:37.833
She is perhaps best known for
her journalism,

00:12:37.833 --> 00:12:39.809
particularly her collection of
essays,

00:12:39.809 --> 00:12:43.442
Slouching Towards Bethlehem,
which I believe came out in

00:12:43.442 --> 00:12:46.724
1968, in which she coolly
confronts and sensibly analyzes

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:49.830
the confusing cultural climate
of the late 1960s.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:53.634
What I think is most remarkable
about her reporting is the lack

00:12:53.634 --> 00:12:56.273
of naiveté
with which this literally tiny

00:12:56.273 --> 00:12:59.320
woman-- I don't know if you any
of you seen a picture of her.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.460
She's just remarkably small.

00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:08.792
So, she is clear-eyed,
but not unsympathetic,

00:13:08.792 --> 00:13:11.869
innocent but detached,
and above all candid in her

00:13:11.869 --> 00:13:14.570
assessment of her country and
her time.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.071
The voice that she develops in
Slouching Towards Bethlehem

00:13:17.071 --> 00:13:19.240
serves her very well in
Play It As It Lays.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.685
She's able here,
too, to draw the same sort of

00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:24.629
precise portraits that she
relied upon in her nonfiction,

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:27.964
that results in a novel that is
positively, undeniably

00:13:27.964 --> 00:13:30.154
seductive.
The plot revolves around a

00:13:30.154 --> 00:13:31.923
sort of marginal actress,
Maria Wyeth,

00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:34.553
who is divorced from her
director husband and who drifts

00:13:34.553 --> 00:13:37.421
aimlessly through the Hollywood
party scene of the late 1960s

00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:39.429
waiting for something to touch
her,

00:13:39.429 --> 00:13:41.620
impact her emotionally and
morally.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.535
She's both damaged and,
as a result,

00:13:43.535 --> 00:13:46.923
utterly unreachable.
Tragedies--and there are many,

00:13:46.923 --> 00:13:50.272
major and minor,
that sort of blithely by--slip

00:13:50.272 --> 00:13:53.491
off her or appear to.
It is a novel very much about a

00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:55.533
woman who accepts everything,
feels nothing,

00:13:55.533 --> 00:13:57.860
and finally resigns herself to
the inevitable.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.693
The inevitable is,
in many cases,

00:13:59.693 --> 00:14:02.330
trivial fates dealt out at
cocktail parties.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:05.329
It is told in several voices,
Maria's and three of her

00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:07.876
closest friends,
and each character is haunted

00:14:07.876 --> 00:14:11.102
by an ineffable loss of meaning
and consequences that they

00:14:11.102 --> 00:14:13.310
either ignore or are ignorant
of,

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:16.652
willfully or otherwise.
In many ways these characters'

00:14:16.652 --> 00:14:20.139
lives are coming or drifting
apart, and their lack of

00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:23.837
awareness of this fact becomes,
through Didion's prose,

00:14:23.837 --> 00:14:27.104
our own, so that the shock of
the final scenes is both

00:14:27.104 --> 00:14:30.460
powerful and hopelessly hollow.
And I don't mean that in the

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:33.452
negative sense.
I mean that we feel that

00:14:33.452 --> 00:14:38.188
consequences perhaps are
unimportant, that there is

00:14:38.188 --> 00:14:41.714
something larger at work.
So, Play It As It

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.900
Lays, I think,
fits very nicely into the

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.436
syllabus because it provides a
beautiful contrast to The

00:14:46.436 --> 00:14:49.059
Crying of Lot 49 in that it
depicts the disintegration of

00:14:49.059 --> 00:14:51.770
southern California,
and specifically L.A.,

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:55.179
in a much less manic,
but no less troubling way.

00:14:55.179 --> 00:14:57.311
Didion's language,
in its flat,

00:14:57.311 --> 00:15:01.005
plain tone, mimics the flat,
plain Los Angeles of her

00:15:01.005 --> 00:15:03.345
narrative,
as Pynchon's convoluted,

00:15:03.345 --> 00:15:06.094
elusive language does his
perplexing and intricate

00:15:06.094 --> 00:15:08.205
portrait of the city.
Also, as with

00:15:08.205 --> 00:15:11.207
Housekeeping,
the loss of self is imagined as

00:15:11.207 --> 00:15:14.010
a dispersal,
though Didion's dispersal is a

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.700
cold, defensive and ultimately
empty one.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.882
Slouching Towards
Bethlehem begins with a

00:15:18.882 --> 00:15:21.492
quote from Yeats that includes
the phrase "The center will not

00:15:21.492 --> 00:15:23.350
hold."
This has become very emblematic

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.414
of that era.
Maria, who in the first few

00:15:25.414 --> 00:15:27.692
pages declares that nothing
applies to her,

00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:30.403
is perhaps one of the most
poignant examples of the

00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:32.789
personal consequences of the
loosening,

00:15:32.789 --> 00:15:35.500
the loss of cultural
restrictions in the 1960s,

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.976
a time when,
in fact, none of the old rules

00:15:37.976 --> 00:15:41.393
applied to her or anyone else.
Didion proposes that the

00:15:41.393 --> 00:15:44.750
consequences of this freedom
might be more than any single

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.119
individual can cope with,
that in fact if nothing

00:15:48.119 --> 00:15:52.381
applies, the individual center,
no lesson societies cannot

00:15:52.381 --> 00:15:54.379
hold.
It is an account of the '60s

00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:56.879
that appears perhaps elsewhere,
but was, I think,

00:15:56.879 --> 00:16:00.423
defined by Didion in this
novel, and I want to read a very

00:16:00.423 --> 00:16:02.600
brief passage from the
beginning.

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.970
Here we go.
I am what I am.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.389
To look for reasons is beside
the point.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:14.750
But because the pursuit of
reasons is their business

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.000
here--[she is,
I believe,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.001
at this point
institutionalized]

00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:20.584
they ask me questions:
"Maria, yes or no:

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:24.330
I see a clock in this inkblot.
Maria, yes or no?"

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.490
A large number of people are
guilty of bad sexual conduct.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.440
I believe my sins are
unpardonable.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.440
I have been disappointed in
love.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.210
How could I answer?
How could it apply?

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.860
"Nothing applies," I print with
a magnetized IBM pencil.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.754
"What does apply?"
they ask later,

00:16:40.754 --> 00:16:44.089
as if the word "nothing" were
ambiguous, open to

00:16:44.089 --> 00:16:47.210
interpretation,
a questionable fragment of an

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:50.331
Icelandic rune.
"There are only certain facts,"

00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:53.460
I say, trying again to be an
agreeable player of the game,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:56.149
"certain facts,
certain things that happened."

00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:58.572
They will misread the facts,
invent connections,

00:16:58.572 --> 00:17:00.943
will extrapolate reasons where
none exist, but,

00:17:00.943 --> 00:17:03.519
I told you, that is their
business here.

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:06.847
And I think it would be
wonderful to end the semester

00:17:06.847 --> 00:17:09.982
with a strong female voice that
is darkly amusing,

00:17:09.982 --> 00:17:12.349
courageous and,
especially, cold.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.980
And I don't mean cold in the
negative sense;

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:19.501
just that she approaches things
in a sort of detached way that

00:17:19.501 --> 00:17:22.539
allows you to observe these
characters,

00:17:22.539 --> 00:17:26.658
but not attach yourselves to
them in a way that promotes a

00:17:26.658 --> 00:17:31.065
sort of self-identification that
makes it difficult for you to

00:17:31.065 --> 00:17:34.804
judge their actions.
It's also fairly short,

00:17:34.804 --> 00:17:38.900
just over 200 pages:
a fast, captivating read.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.837
This is a sort of stupid
analogy, but I imagine it's sort

00:17:41.837 --> 00:17:43.829
of like getting on a highway in
L.A.

00:17:43.829 --> 00:17:47.688
(not during rush hour) but
heading to where you're going,

00:17:47.688 --> 00:17:51.408
maybe east towards the hills,
and you get to your exit,

00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:55.190
sort of, before you realize it.
So that's my pitch.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:08.509
Thank you.Will: Hi.
My name is Will.

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:13.559
I'm pitching Jesus' Son
by Denis Johnson.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:17.180
I'm actually going to start
without introducing it at all.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.715
I'm just going to play a clip
from the movie that was made of

00:18:19.715 --> 00:18:22.483
the book.
I'm not even going to talk

00:18:22.483 --> 00:18:24.676
about it.
Will: That was a clip

00:18:24.676 --> 00:18:27.196
from the movie version of
Jesus' Son, and

00:18:27.196 --> 00:18:29.420
this is the book.
It's by Denis Johnson,

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.998
who has been in the news a lot
lately because he wrote Tree

00:18:32.998 --> 00:18:36.869
of Smoke, which won
the National Book Award in 2007.

00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:39.718
And this book is,
kind of, the book that

00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:42.785
established him as a serious,
great author,

00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:47.054
and I think it's wonderful.
It's a collection of stories,

00:18:47.054 --> 00:18:50.509
and they're all kind of about
the same character,

00:18:50.509 --> 00:18:53.514
one of the characters you saw
in there, and kind of the same

00:18:53.514 --> 00:18:56.619
group of characters runs through
all the different stories.

00:18:56.619 --> 00:19:00.803
And so, it's kind of novelistic
in that way, kind of like

00:19:00.803 --> 00:19:04.390
Lost in the Funhouse,
the book we read.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.433
I guess, as you might or might
not have been able to tell from

00:19:08.433 --> 00:19:12.079
the clip, the book kind of deals
with drug addiction,

00:19:12.079 --> 00:19:15.390
and the main character is
addicted to heroin.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:20.711
But I really think the book
kind of transcends the drug

00:19:20.711 --> 00:19:23.832
genre.
I'm not a huge fan of drug

00:19:23.832 --> 00:19:27.868
books, myself,
but I think this book is really

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:32.174
beautiful and powerful and
devastating and really

00:19:32.174 --> 00:19:36.880
hilarious,
really funny at times.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.696
What else?
It's short (like everyone else

00:19:38.696 --> 00:19:40.880
has been saying),
but this book really is short.

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:48.951
It's only 160 pages,
and there really aren't very

00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:53.542
many words on each page,
'cause it's quite small,

00:19:53.542 --> 00:19:55.360
as you can see.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.344
And really, I find this book--
I don't know how much I want to

00:20:03.344 --> 00:20:07.841
describe it, but it takes place
mostly in Iowa and kind of just

00:20:07.841 --> 00:20:11.740
travels around,
kind of daily things.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.250
In one of the stories the main
character and his friend decide

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.645
to rip scrap metal from a house
and sell it to make a little

00:20:18.645 --> 00:20:21.119
money so they can get drunk that
night,

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:24.069
and just different kind of
adventures that they go on.

00:20:24.069 --> 00:20:28.057
And then the book kind of ends
as he makes this kind of

00:20:28.057 --> 00:20:32.099
pilgrimage to Arizona.
It's really beautiful.

00:20:32.099 --> 00:20:36.569
I guess I'll just read you a
quick passage,

00:20:36.569 --> 00:20:40.472
if that's all right.
We bumped softly down a

00:20:40.472 --> 00:20:43.329
hill toward an open field that
seemed to be a military

00:20:43.329 --> 00:20:46.293
graveyard filled with rows and
rows of austere identical

00:20:46.293 --> 00:20:50.107
markers over soldiers' graves.
I'd never before come across

00:20:50.107 --> 00:20:52.398
this cemetery.
On the farther side of the

00:20:52.398 --> 00:20:55.352
field, just beyond the curtains
of snow, the sky was torn away

00:20:55.352 --> 00:20:58.500
and the angels were descending
out of a brilliant blue summer,

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.099
their huge faces streaked with
light and full of pity.

00:21:02.099 --> 00:21:05.072
The sight of them cut through
my heart and down the knuckles

00:21:05.072 --> 00:21:07.944
of my spine, and if there had
been anything in my bowels I

00:21:07.944 --> 00:21:10.009
would have messed my pants from
fear.

00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:13.291
Georgie opened his arms and
cried out, "It's the drive-in,

00:21:13.291 --> 00:21:16.016
man, the drive-in!"
I wasn't sure what these words

00:21:16.016 --> 00:21:17.933
meant.
"They're showing movies in a

00:21:17.933 --> 00:21:20.000
fucking blizzard," Georgie
screamed.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.648
"I see.
I thought it was something

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:25.681
else," I said.
We walked carefully down there

00:21:25.681 --> 00:21:29.635
and climbed through the busted
fence and stood in the very

00:21:29.635 --> 00:21:31.559
back.
The speakers which I had

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:34.240
mistaken for grave markers
muttered in unison.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.935
Then there was tinkly music of
which I could very nearly make

00:21:37.935 --> 00:21:40.305
out the tune.
Famous movie stars rode

00:21:40.305 --> 00:21:43.761
bicycles beside a river,
laughing out of their gigantic,

00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:46.202
lovely mouths.
If anybody had ever come to see

00:21:46.202 --> 00:21:48.549
the show, they'd have left when
the weather started.

00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:51.535
Not one car remained,
not even a broken-down one from

00:21:51.535 --> 00:21:54.750
last week, or one left here
because it was out of gas.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.261
In a couple of minutes,
in the middle of a whirling

00:21:57.261 --> 00:21:59.269
square dance,
the screen turned black,

00:21:59.269 --> 00:22:01.136
the cinematic summer ended,
the snow went dark,

00:22:01.136 --> 00:22:02.760
there was nothing but my
breath.

00:22:05.809 --> 00:22:08.009
So, I guess that gives you
enough of an idea of it.

00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:10.420
I think it's great and I think
you should vote for it.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.525
It's a quick read.
It's really riveting and

00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:17.580
enthralling and I find it really
an incredible book.

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.430
So, Jesus' Son.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.318
Eli: Hi. I'm Eli.
The book I wanted to pitch was

00:22:36.318 --> 00:22:39.369
Everything is Illuminated
by Jonathan Safran Foer.

00:22:39.369 --> 00:22:41.666
And the main reason I wanted to
pitch it, of course,

00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:44.459
was: Professor Hungerford said
that she's waiting for one of us

00:22:44.459 --> 00:22:47.787
to pitch their own book,
and--contrary to conventional

00:22:47.787 --> 00:22:51.779
wisdom--this is actually my own
book, just so you know.

00:22:51.779 --> 00:22:54.306
But, setting aside authorship
issues--the thing is,

00:22:54.306 --> 00:22:56.630
you just had to introduce the
seed of doubt,

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.772
and then the rumors percolate,
so this is good--I love books

00:23:00.772 --> 00:23:04.142
that have outrageous characters.
Actually, hearing some of these

00:23:04.142 --> 00:23:05.662
pitches, I was like,
"oh, maybe I should vote for

00:23:05.662 --> 00:23:07.460
some of the other books."
But I won't tell you that.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.146
But, this book does have
outrageous characters,

00:23:10.146 --> 00:23:12.990
which is really cool.
And also, I just thought,

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.890
the pitch, I would just kind of
describe some of the characters,

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:18.782
and you'd be like,
"those characters are indeed

00:23:18.782 --> 00:23:20.839
outrageous," or go,
"I will vote for this book."

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:23.279
So, the book kind of takes
place in two different worlds.

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:26.621
One is the world of
Trachimbrod, which is a small

00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:30.102
shtetl in the eighteenth
century, and also Jonathan

00:23:30.102 --> 00:23:34.273
Safran Foer's ancestral home.
And the other world is kind of

00:23:34.273 --> 00:23:37.833
modern day Ukraine and it
features Jonathan Safran Foer on

00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:39.685
a quest.
As, I don't know if you Jews

00:23:39.685 --> 00:23:41.100
out there, I'm sure,
at some point,

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.339
have done this,
as I have, been drawn to

00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:46.193
Slovakia or Ukraine to find the
ancestral home,

00:23:46.193 --> 00:23:50.039
and that's what Jonathan Safran
Foer is doing in this book.

00:23:50.039 --> 00:23:51.819
So, in the, kind of,
modern-day world,

00:23:51.819 --> 00:23:54.079
there are a number of really
cool characters.

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:57.099
The main one is the hero,
Jonathan Safran Foer,

00:23:57.099 --> 00:24:01.169
who is also referred to as the
"spoiled Jew" and the "ingenious

00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:03.367
Jew."
The other character is his

00:24:03.367 --> 00:24:05.593
humble translator,
Alexander Perchov,

00:24:05.593 --> 00:24:09.365
who learned English exclusively
through the use of a thesaurus

00:24:09.365 --> 00:24:13.137
(which produces some outrageous
results) and who works for the

00:24:13.137 --> 00:24:15.720
family business,
Heritage Touring.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.736
His description of it is: 
It's for Jewish people

00:24:19.736 --> 00:24:22.577
like the hero who have cravings
to leave the ennobled country

00:24:22.577 --> 00:24:25.230
America and visit humble towns
in Poland and Ukraine.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.993
I will be truthful again and
mention that before this voyage

00:24:27.993 --> 00:24:30.803
I had the opinion that Jewish
people were having shit between

00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:33.137
their brains.
That is because all I knew of

00:24:33.137 --> 00:24:36.318
Jewish people was that they paid
father very much currency in

00:24:36.318 --> 00:24:39.340
order to make vacations from
America to Ukraine.

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.095
Food for thought.
And then there's also Alex's

00:24:43.095 --> 00:24:47.227
dog, Sammy Davis Junior,
Jr., which is Heritage

00:24:47.227 --> 00:24:51.000
Touring's "officious seeing-eye
bitch."

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.347
So, that's one world.
And in the other world,

00:24:53.347 --> 00:24:56.383
the world of the shtetl,
we have a Well-Regarded Rabbi

00:24:56.383 --> 00:24:58.559
who speaks exclusively in
capitals.

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:01.722
We have Brod,
a brilliant girl who emerges

00:25:01.722 --> 00:25:06.427
magically from a river and is
adopted by the disgraced usurer,

00:25:06.427 --> 00:25:08.619
Yankel D.
We have two synagogues,

00:25:08.619 --> 00:25:11.359
the Congregation of the
Slouchers and the Congregation

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:13.366
of the Upright.
We have villagers,

00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:16.056
including the deceased
philosopher, Pinchas T,

00:25:16.056 --> 00:25:18.723
who in his only notable paper,
"To the Dust:

00:25:18.723 --> 00:25:21.819
From Man You Came and to Man
You Shall Return," argues that

00:25:21.819 --> 00:25:24.865
it would be possible,
in theory, for life and art to

00:25:24.865 --> 00:25:27.687
be reversed.
We have the good gefilte-fish

00:25:27.687 --> 00:25:31.014
monger, Bitzl Bitzl R.
We have the mad squire and

00:25:31.014 --> 00:25:32.839
village rapist,
Sofiowka N.

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:35.075
We have Harry V,
the shtetl's master logician

00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:37.616
and resident pervert,
who had been working for many

00:25:37.616 --> 00:25:40.925
years on his magnum opus,
"The Host of Hoists," which,

00:25:40.925 --> 00:25:43.743
he promised,
contained the tightest of tight

00:25:43.743 --> 00:25:46.955
logical proofs that God
indiscriminately loves the

00:25:46.955 --> 00:25:50.582
indiscriminate lover.
So, I don't know how many of us

00:25:50.582 --> 00:25:52.690
that will pardon,
in hereâ€¦

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.835
So, besides these
outrageous characters,

00:25:54.835 --> 00:25:57.980
I do think this book fits well
with the themes of the course.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:01.089
It deals with identity,
language and experience,

00:26:01.089 --> 00:26:04.000
and problems of narration and
remembrance.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.308
As the New York Times Book
Review (I guess you could

00:26:07.308 --> 00:26:10.102
say) lauded the book,
"Not since A Clockwork

00:26:10.102 --> 00:26:13.303
Orange has the English
language been simultaneously

00:26:13.303 --> 00:26:16.859
mauled and energized with such
brilliance and such brio."

00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:18.752
So, going with that,
I thought I'd read,

00:26:18.752 --> 00:26:21.759
as people have been inclined to
do, a passage from the book.

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:22.910
I'm going to take a little risk
here.

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:27.792
I've been reading the book with
a Russian accent in my head,

00:26:27.792 --> 00:26:31.599
so I figured I would just go
with that here.

00:26:31.599 --> 00:26:34.515
I figured that would have the
added benefit of:

00:26:34.515 --> 00:26:36.670
If you don't vote for this
book,

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.160
then I'll just be the kid who
made a fool of himself and read

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.069
with a Russian accent in front
of everybody.

00:26:41.069 --> 00:26:43.670
So, I know you don't want to do
that to me.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.009
Yeah. Okay, I think. All right.
So here we go.

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:53.439
This is Alex kind of
introducing himself at the

00:26:53.439 --> 00:26:56.316
beginning of the book:
"I dig Negroes,

00:26:56.316 --> 00:27:00.352
particularly Michael Jackson.
I dig to disseminate very much

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:02.829
currency at famous nightclubs in
Odessa.

00:27:02.829 --> 00:27:06.839
Lamborghini Countaches are
excellent so are cappuccinos.

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:09.743
Many girls want to be carnal
with me in many good

00:27:09.743 --> 00:27:12.343
arrangements,
notwithstanding the Inebriated

00:27:12.343 --> 00:27:14.976
Kangaroo,
the Gorky Tickle and the

00:27:14.976 --> 00:27:18.354
Unyielding Zookeeper.
If you want to know why so many

00:27:18.354 --> 00:27:21.398
girls want to be with me,
it is because I am very premium

00:27:21.398 --> 00:27:24.409
person to be with.
I am homely and also severely

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:26.730
funny and these are winning
things.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.097
But nonetheless I know many
people who dig rapid cars and

00:27:30.097 --> 00:27:32.837
famous discotheques.
There are so many here who

00:27:32.837 --> 00:27:35.618
perform the Sputnik Bosom
Dalliance--which is always

00:27:35.618 --> 00:27:38.508
terminated with a slimy
underface--that I cannot tally

00:27:38.508 --> 00:27:41.526
them on all of my hands.
There are even many people

00:27:41.526 --> 00:27:44.098
named Alex.
(Three in my house alone!) That

00:27:44.098 --> 00:27:47.792
is why I was so effervescent to
go to Lutsk and translate for

00:27:47.792 --> 00:27:51.599
Jonathan Safran Foer.
It would be unordinary.

00:27:51.599 --> 00:27:54.530
So that's said,
and a fool proudly made.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.460
That's it.
Thank you.

00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:06.510
Roger:
Well, it's really

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.870
unfortunate to have to go after
that, but hi.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.044
My name's Roger.
I'm presenting for Amina's

00:28:12.044 --> 00:28:14.660
section, and we're doing Dave
Eggers' What is the What

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:17.370
(and you can't see the
"What" because it's 20% off;

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:20.699
plug, plug).
And, I guess,

00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:23.864
rather than try to sum up the
book myself, I'll use not the

00:28:23.864 --> 00:28:27.085
author's but the person about
whom the book is written's own

00:28:27.085 --> 00:28:30.305
words: "What is the What
is the soulful account of my

00:28:30.305 --> 00:28:32.899
life,
from the time I was separated

00:28:32.899 --> 00:28:36.645
from my family in Marial Bai
---- to the thirteen years I

00:28:36.645 --> 00:28:39.789
spent in Ethiopian and Kenyan
refugee camps,

00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:43.218
to my encounter with vibrant
Western cultures beginning in

00:28:43.218 --> 00:28:46.767
Atlanta, to the generosity and
challenges that I encountered

00:28:46.767 --> 00:28:49.257
elsewhere.
So, just to add a little

00:28:49.257 --> 00:28:52.787
bit to that, What is the What
is a story of a Sudanese

00:28:52.787 --> 00:28:56.355
refugee in the United States.
And in the course of telling

00:28:56.355 --> 00:28:59.486
it, he reads an account from his
life back in Africa,

00:28:59.486 --> 00:29:02.737
to stories here in the United
States, and everything in

00:29:02.737 --> 00:29:05.130
between.
As for reasons why you should

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.463
want to vote for it or read it,
I think the first thing which

00:29:08.463 --> 00:29:11.518
many of us in the section
realize about the book is just

00:29:11.518 --> 00:29:14.952
that it's really engaging.
It's written in a way that's,

00:29:14.952 --> 00:29:17.431
I would say,
kind of refreshing compared to

00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:20.915
some of the other more--how to
put it?--complex authors that

00:29:20.915 --> 00:29:23.556
we've read,
in that it's just really

00:29:23.556 --> 00:29:27.869
accessible and really just an
easy read that's deeply human.

00:29:27.869 --> 00:29:30.413
You feel like you're having a
conversation with the guy,

00:29:30.413 --> 00:29:33.048
and (even though the guy is
actually having a conversation

00:29:33.048 --> 00:29:35.919
with Dave Eggers,
so maybe that's why you get

00:29:35.919 --> 00:29:39.015
that impression,
but at any rate) it's also a

00:29:39.015 --> 00:29:41.829
book which manages to address
really,

00:29:41.829 --> 00:29:45.913
really serious current issues
such as civil war,

00:29:45.913 --> 00:29:49.650
genocide, alienation in
American society,

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:52.257
but do so in a way that's
simultaneously really poignant

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:53.490
and inspiring,
but also,

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:55.886
actually, funny.
It's not a book that you're

00:29:55.886 --> 00:29:58.829
going to read and be depressed
by, even though you will come

00:29:58.829 --> 00:30:01.673
from it having really felt that
you're dealing with really

00:30:01.673 --> 00:30:04.879
significant material,
which I thought is really cool,

00:30:04.879 --> 00:30:08.390
and we thought was really cool.
It's also--just going on to

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.420
the whole contemporary thing--
it's written by one of the best

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.339
contemporary authors out there.
He was nominated for a Pulitzer;

00:30:15.339 --> 00:30:17.591
he was a Pulitzer Prize
finalist, I think,

00:30:17.591 --> 00:30:19.378
last year, 2007.
(I'm not sure,

00:30:19.378 --> 00:30:22.513
and if I got that wrong and
someone here is a big Eggers

00:30:22.513 --> 00:30:24.680
fan, I'm terribly sorry.) But
yeah;

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.523
he's great.
And, in a course where we're

00:30:27.523 --> 00:30:31.778
doing from 1945 to the present,
I think it's good to have a

00:30:31.778 --> 00:30:34.712
really strong,
really contemporary author

00:30:34.712 --> 00:30:37.789
represented.
So, that's another cool thing.

00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:40.385
Another thing which I think
would be really cool about

00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:43.471
reading this book is that - it's
not your standard academic book

00:30:43.471 --> 00:30:45.785
at all.
You're not going to find this

00:30:45.785 --> 00:30:48.661
book on any syllabus,
but it still really merits

00:30:48.661 --> 00:30:52.272
being read in that sort of a
context because of the depth of

00:30:52.272 --> 00:30:54.660
the material that's being
covered,

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:56.789
because of the way it's written.
Really, there are some

00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:58.490
beautiful descriptions with
beautiful language.

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:01.079
And, well, for any other reason
that you'd want to read a book

00:31:01.079 --> 00:31:02.819
in a class, it can serve that
function,

00:31:02.819 --> 00:31:05.580
and yet you'd probably more
like to hear about it in a

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.008
coffee shop or in a restaurant.
So, I think that's a pretty

00:31:09.008 --> 00:31:11.730
cool opportunity which this
would give us.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:13.891
As far as tying in to the
course matters,

00:31:13.891 --> 00:31:15.660
this book is a great,
great study,

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.370
and, I would think,
an unprecedented study,

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.630
as far as the Identity Plot
goes,

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.706
for our class,
because as a black African the

00:31:23.706 --> 00:31:27.830
protagonist is identified not by
his ethnicity in the United

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.109
States,
but by his race.

00:31:30.109 --> 00:31:33.515
And, as is shown in a really
very interesting,

00:31:33.515 --> 00:31:36.768
I guess, scene,
at the very beginning of the

00:31:36.768 --> 00:31:39.074
book,
where he's being robbed by a

00:31:39.074 --> 00:31:42.031
black man who says to him,
"Oh, well, we're brothers

00:31:42.031 --> 00:31:45.279
because you're African" and at
the same time derides,

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:47.863
only refers to him as African
and actually mislabels him as

00:31:47.863 --> 00:31:50.674
Nigerian when he's Sudanese.
So, it really offers some

00:31:50.674 --> 00:31:53.740
really interesting perspective
into issues of race,

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:58.702
issues of ethnicity,
and just a totally new look at

00:31:58.702 --> 00:32:01.680
American society from,
yeah,

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.390
a perspective that we're not
really used to.

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.259
I guess, yeah,
that basically covers that.

00:32:06.259 --> 00:32:08.667
As far as some other,
maybe a little bit sillier

00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:11.500
things, this is a great date
book for those of you who either

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.529
are dating or are looking to be
dating.

00:32:13.529 --> 00:32:16.376
It's a book that people are
reading all of the time,

00:32:16.376 --> 00:32:18.329
and, even if they aren't
reading,

00:32:18.329 --> 00:32:21.147
then you can really wow them
with just your knowledge of

00:32:21.147 --> 00:32:23.811
contemporary literature,
and to say nothing of your

00:32:23.811 --> 00:32:26.627
concern for the people who are
struggling in America and

00:32:26.627 --> 00:32:29.779
abroad.
So, really, that's a big plug.

00:32:29.779 --> 00:32:32.549
And it's also won a bunch of
awards.

00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:36.247
It was a finalist for the
National Book Critics Circle

00:32:36.247 --> 00:32:39.037
Award for Fiction,
which I think is good,

00:32:39.037 --> 00:32:42.505
and the guy from Barnes &amp;
Noble would not let me leave

00:32:42.505 --> 00:32:45.210
the counter because he liked it
so much, and he is a good judge.

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:47.592
So, those are some really
good plugs but as far as a

00:32:47.592 --> 00:32:50.320
weakness, you might notice it's
a little bit bigger than some of

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:53.736
the other books that we've read,
but I promise you that that's

00:32:53.736 --> 00:32:55.677
okay.
You fly through the pages,

00:32:55.677 --> 00:32:58.493
and just to give you a sense of
why you do that,

00:32:58.493 --> 00:33:01.130
I'll read to you a section from
the book.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:03.571
It's actually the last
paragraph of the book,

00:33:03.571 --> 00:33:06.846
but it's not like one of those
spoilers, like "And then your

00:33:06.846 --> 00:33:07.953
mother died."
No.

00:33:07.953 --> 00:33:09.484
It actually,
really, I think,

00:33:09.484 --> 00:33:12.380
is very fitting to read,
now, because it's kind of his

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.730
plug for why you should read his
book,

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.110
or at least it's a description
of why he tells this story.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.728
So here we go.
Whatever I do,

00:33:20.728 --> 00:33:23.660
however I find a way to live,
I will tell these stories.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.212
I have spoken to every person I
have encountered these last

00:33:26.212 --> 00:33:27.929
difficult days,
and every person who has

00:33:27.929 --> 00:33:30.349
entered this club during these
awful morning hours,

00:33:30.349 --> 00:33:32.689
because to do anything else
would be something less than

00:33:32.689 --> 00:33:34.346
human.
I speak to these people,

00:33:34.346 --> 00:33:36.869
and I speak to you,
because I cannot help it.

00:33:36.869 --> 00:33:39.471
It gives me strength,
almost unbelievable strength,

00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:41.982
to know that you are there.
I covet your eyes,

00:33:41.982 --> 00:33:44.490
your ears, the collapsible
space between us.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.430
How blessed are we to have each
other.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:49.794
I am alive, and you are alive,
so we must fill the air with

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:51.718
our words.
I will fill today,

00:33:51.718 --> 00:33:55.130
tomorrow, every day until I am
taken back to God.

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:57.803
I will tell these stories to
people who will listen and to

00:33:57.803 --> 00:34:00.664
people who don't want to listen,
to people who seek me out and

00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:03.250
to those who run.
All the while I will know that

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.492
you are there.
How can I pretend that you do

00:34:05.492 --> 00:34:07.215
not exist?
It would be almost as

00:34:07.215 --> 00:34:10.350
impossible as you pretending
that I do not exist.

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.030
Thanks.

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:19.030
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Okay.

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.076
Vote.
If this were really a high-tech

00:34:22.076 --> 00:34:24.378
classroom, we'd have a little
console for you,

00:34:24.378 --> 00:34:26.630
and you'd be voting online,
but we don't.

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:29.810
Okay. Okay.
Anyone need a ballot?

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:38.420
Okay. Rank them 1,2, 3.
TAs get to vote, too.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.320
Yes, you do.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.260
And when you're finished,
pass them to the aisles.

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.660
Can I borrow your pencil?

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.190
I am voting too.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:49.620
Okay. Everybody voted?
Okay, TFs.

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.430
Everybody done?
Pass them over.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.760
Okay.
We will see them in a moment.

00:36:03.389 --> 00:36:07.449
Well, let me say it's a tough
act to follow you guys so

00:36:07.449 --> 00:36:11.510
congratulations to all the
people who pitched books,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:15.795
although I have to say I am a
little hurt at the implied

00:36:15.795 --> 00:36:18.670
criticism.
Long?

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:20.780
Long?
Hard?

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.157
Boring?
I don't recognize my own

00:36:24.157 --> 00:36:25.825
syllabus.
Maybe the long,

00:36:25.825 --> 00:36:28.059
but not the hard and the
boring.

00:36:28.059 --> 00:36:31.300
So, we will see what that next
book will be.

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:37.942
Now, I have exactly five
minutes, so what I think I want

00:36:37.942 --> 00:36:45.260
to do is just say something very
quick about loss in this book.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:48.499
I put this quote up on the
board: "Need can blossom into

00:36:48.499 --> 00:36:50.619
all the compensation it
requires."

00:36:50.619 --> 00:36:56.243
That little blurb,
I think, encapsulates this

00:36:56.243 --> 00:37:02.291
novel's meditation on loss.
I asked you last time to think

00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:06.741
about where Ruth's voice comes
from, what situation we can

00:37:06.741 --> 00:37:09.079
imagine,
and there are a bunch of

00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:12.716
different theories that critics
have put forward about where

00:37:12.716 --> 00:37:15.860
Ruth is and from where we hear
her voice coming.

00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:18.734
One is that she's dead and
she's speaking to us from the

00:37:18.734 --> 00:37:22.159
afterlife, that she really,
somehow, did die in the lake

00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:26.454
that day, that she fell off the
bridge, or somehow the bridge is

00:37:26.454 --> 00:37:29.250
a metaphor for her passage into
death.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.407
Or that this is an adult Ruth,
living who knows where,

00:37:34.407 --> 00:37:39.468
or just as a transient,
who has written this account,

00:37:39.468 --> 00:37:42.679
or who speaks to us,
somehow.

00:37:42.679 --> 00:37:47.043
I think that quotation from
Marilynne Robinson that I gave

00:37:47.043 --> 00:37:52.139
you at the end of last lecture,
about how she aims to speak in

00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:57.278
the voice of the consciousness
of the person--not necessarily

00:37:57.278 --> 00:38:02.416
the words that they would use if
they were to write their own

00:38:02.416 --> 00:38:07.555
account--suggests that what she
is getting at doesn't require

00:38:07.555 --> 00:38:12.780
that kind of historical
explanation to account for it,

00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:17.690
that she doesn't want us to
have to think of Ruth speaking

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:24.979
from a particular place,
which is also a way to say that

00:38:24.979 --> 00:38:32.329
Ruth is gone;
somehow Ruth is absent from us.

00:38:32.329 --> 00:38:37.699
And this relates to my point
last time about how identity is

00:38:37.699 --> 00:38:41.495
imagined as voice.
Ruth, the historical Ruth,

00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:45.293
the character Ruth,
a Ruth that we could situate in

00:38:45.293 --> 00:38:48.179
any concrete position in the
world,

00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:52.849
has vanished from the frame of
this novel.

00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:55.690
What we're left with is her
voice.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.516
The logic here is that
vanishing makes the voice

00:39:00.516 --> 00:39:06.638
totally present;
that full human presence is in

00:39:06.638 --> 00:39:13.117
the voice, somehow inherent.
That's why there are all of

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:18.185
these meditations on what would
happen if various people either

00:39:18.185 --> 00:39:21.210
did disappear or didn't
disappear.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:27.207
So, when Ruth meditates on what
it would be like for her to

00:39:27.207 --> 00:39:31.447
leave Sylvie,
she says, "I did not want to

00:39:31.447 --> 00:39:35.789
grow gigantic and multiple to
Sylvie."

00:39:35.789 --> 00:39:39.195
Her sense is that,
by leaving Sylvie,

00:39:39.195 --> 00:39:44.210
her absence would become
enormous, and she herself,

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:48.724
in a kind of negative presence,
would become larger than she

00:39:48.724 --> 00:39:52.702
is, and this is how Ruth feels
about her own mother's

00:39:52.702 --> 00:39:56.109
disappearance,
that when her mother

00:39:56.109 --> 00:40:01.994
disappeared, what she got in
return was the compensation of

00:40:01.994 --> 00:40:06.082
memory: sharp,
specific, evocative,

00:40:06.082 --> 00:40:09.980
mysterious, ever-present
memory.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:13.945
And the visual metaphor for
this kind of memory is,

00:40:13.945 --> 00:40:18.292
of course, the lake.
The lake is imagined to contain

00:40:18.292 --> 00:40:22.994
whole and undecayed all the
objects of the past that have

00:40:22.994 --> 00:40:26.985
been lost in it.
So memory is imagined in the

00:40:26.985 --> 00:40:31.776
same terms, so that you could
always bring them up to the

00:40:31.776 --> 00:40:35.369
surface and there they would be,
whole.

00:40:35.369 --> 00:40:38.959
So, the resurrection
imagined, if you run the film

00:40:38.959 --> 00:40:42.819
backward of the train slipping
in to the lake--I read that

00:40:42.819 --> 00:40:46.680
passage last time--the kind of
resurrection imagined,

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:51.570
is the way memory works.
But more specifically it's the

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.280
way the language of memory
works.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:41:01.550
And I want to read my own
favorite passage.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.595
This is at the very end of the
novel, and I want you to think,

00:41:05.595 --> 00:41:08.772
as I read it,
about the difference between

00:41:08.772 --> 00:41:13.370
this passage and the one I read
from Bluest Eye about

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.002
Pecola,
that passage of negativity

00:41:16.002 --> 00:41:19.208
about her being a kind of blank
or a negative,

00:41:19.208 --> 00:41:23.840
against which all other virtues
could be present in the world.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:28.130
So, think about that as I read
this, the bottom of 217:

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:33.274
Since we are dead,
the house would be hers now

00:41:33.274 --> 00:41:36.949
[hers, Lucille].
Perhaps she is in the kitchen

00:41:36.949 --> 00:41:39.449
snuggling pretty daughters in
her lap.

00:41:39.449 --> 00:41:43.221
And perhaps now and then they
look at the black window to find

00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:45.880
out what their mother seems to
see there,

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.286
and they see their own faces
and a face so like their

00:41:49.286 --> 00:41:52.429
mother's, so rapt and full of
tender watching,

00:41:52.429 --> 00:41:56.690
that only Lucille could think
the face was mine.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:00.004
If Lucille is there,
Sylvie and I have stood outside

00:42:00.004 --> 00:42:03.838
her window a thousand times and
we have thrown the side door

00:42:03.838 --> 00:42:07.152
open when she was upstairs
changing beds and we have

00:42:07.152 --> 00:42:11.246
brought in leaves and flung the
curtains and tipped the bud vase

00:42:11.246 --> 00:42:15.989
and somehow left the house again
before she could run downstairs,

00:42:15.989 --> 00:42:19.510
leaving behind us a strong
smell of lake water.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:23.530
She would sigh and think,
"they never change."

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:27.788
Or imagine Lucille in Boston,
at a table in a restaurant

00:42:27.788 --> 00:42:31.469
waiting for a friend.
She is tastefully dressed,

00:42:31.469 --> 00:42:34.319
wearing, say,
a tweed suit with an amber

00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:38.046
scarf at the throat,
to draw attention to the red in

00:42:38.046 --> 00:42:41.621
her darkening hair.
Her water glass has left two

00:42:41.621 --> 00:42:45.523
thirds of a ring on the table
and she works at completing the

00:42:45.523 --> 00:42:49.651
circle with her thumbnail.
Sylvie and I do not flounce in

00:42:49.651 --> 00:42:52.938
through the door,
smoothing the skirts of our

00:42:52.938 --> 00:42:57.570
oversized coats and combing our
hair back with our fingers.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:43:02.378
We do not sit down at the table
next to hers and empty our

00:43:02.378 --> 00:43:06.490
pockets in a small,
damp heap in the middle of the

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:10.781
table and sort out the gum
wrappers and ticket stubs and

00:43:10.781 --> 00:43:15.071
add up the coins and dollar
bills and laugh and add them

00:43:15.071 --> 00:43:17.310
again.
My mother, likewise,

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:20.346
is not there,
and my grandmother in her house

00:43:20.346 --> 00:43:22.900
slippers with her pigtail
wagging,

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:27.195
and my grandfather with his
hair combed flat against his

00:43:27.195 --> 00:43:31.570
brow does not examine the menu
with studious interest.

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:37.200
We are nowhere in Boston.
However Lucille may look,

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:42.070
she will never find us there,
or any trace or sign.

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:46.951
We pause nowhere in Boston,
even to admire a store window

00:43:46.951 --> 00:43:51.309
and the perimeters of our
wandering are nowhere.

00:43:51.309 --> 00:43:55.009
No one watching this woman
smear her initials in the steam

00:43:55.009 --> 00:43:57.800
on her water glass with her
first finger,

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:02.110
or slip cellophane packets of
oyster crackers into her handbag

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:06.562
for the seagulls could know how
her thoughts are thronged by our

00:44:06.562 --> 00:44:10.335
absence,
or know how she does not watch,

00:44:10.335 --> 00:44:13.165
does not listen,
does not wait,

00:44:13.165 --> 00:44:18.346
does not hope,
and always for me and

00:44:18.346 --> 00:44:24.245
Sylvie.
So, you see in that incredibly

00:44:24.245 --> 00:44:31.276
lyrical evocation of absence how
the very absence calls forth

00:44:31.276 --> 00:44:35.805
this lyric voice.
The structure is exactly the

00:44:35.805 --> 00:44:40.490
same as the one that Morrison
uses to describe what Pecola is

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:44.940
to Claudia and Frieda and the
rest of their community.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.865
It's a way in which absence
calls forth the living essence

00:44:49.865 --> 00:44:53.927
of other people,
but here what's called forth is

00:44:53.927 --> 00:44:57.730
a sort of living essence of
imagination,

00:44:57.730 --> 00:45:03.706
a living essence of voice,
so that Sylvie and Ruth's

00:45:03.706 --> 00:45:10.972
absence for Lucille becomes the
very presence that they have to

00:45:10.972 --> 00:45:15.438
her.
There is a passage earlier in

00:45:15.438 --> 00:45:22.617
the novel where she describes
the condition of the body that

00:45:22.617 --> 00:45:28.579
matches up with this
understanding of absence.

00:45:28.579 --> 00:45:34.324
She's outside in the
orchard--this is on

00:45:34.324 --> 00:45:42.868
203--imagining the story of a
young girl in a lighted house

00:45:42.868 --> 00:45:46.480
that she sees.
Let's see.

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.010
It would be that kind of story,
a very melancholy story.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:51.363
Her hair,
which was as black as the sky,

00:45:51.363 --> 00:45:53.349
and so long that it swept after
her,

00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:55.369
a wind in the grass,
her fingers,

00:45:55.369 --> 00:45:59.029
which were sky black and so
fine and slender that they were

00:45:59.029 --> 00:46:01.489
only cold touch like drops of
rain,

00:46:01.489 --> 00:46:05.198
her step, which was so silent
that people were surprised when

00:46:05.198 --> 00:46:10.231
they even thought they heard it,
she would be transformed by the

00:46:10.231 --> 00:46:13.730
growth of light into a mortal
child.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:16.218
And, when she stood at the
bright window,

00:46:16.218 --> 00:46:18.769
she would find that the world
was gone,

00:46:18.769 --> 00:46:22.295
the orchard was gone,
her mother and grandmother and

00:46:22.295 --> 00:46:25.266
aunts were gone.
Like Noah's wife on the tenth

00:46:25.266 --> 00:46:28.601
or fifteenth night of rain,
she would stand in the window

00:46:28.601 --> 00:46:31.340
and realize that the world was
really lost.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.565
And those outside would
scarcely know her,

00:46:34.565 --> 00:46:39.065
so sadly was she changed.
Before she had been fleshed in

00:46:39.065 --> 00:46:43.024
air, and clothed in nakedness,
and mantled in cold,

00:46:43.024 --> 00:46:47.537
and her very bones were only
slender things like shards of

00:46:47.537 --> 00:46:50.217
ice.
She had haunted the orchard out

00:46:50.217 --> 00:46:52.819
of preference,
but she could walk into the

00:46:52.819 --> 00:46:55.040
lake without ripple or
displacement,

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.769
and sail up the air invisibly
as heat.

00:46:57.769 --> 00:47:01.819
And now, lost to her kind,
she would almost forget them,

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:05.942
and she would feed coarse food
to her coarse flesh and be

00:47:05.942 --> 00:47:10.411
almost satisfied.
And then Ruth meditates on her

00:47:10.411 --> 00:47:14.050
transformation in that time in
the orchard.

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.710
If I had stayed there,
I might have discovered other

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:17.956
things.
For example,

00:47:17.956 --> 00:47:21.816
I was hungry enough to begin to
learn that hunger has its

00:47:21.816 --> 00:47:25.400
pleasures, and I was happily at
ease in the dark.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.970
And, in general,
I could feel that I was

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:31.199
breaking the tethers of need,
one by one.

00:47:31.199 --> 00:47:35.020
I would call this an anorexic
aesthetic.

00:47:36.849 --> 00:47:41.810
It's an aesthetic of starving
the self into invisibility so

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:44.889
that the voice can become
present.

00:47:44.889 --> 00:47:48.876
So in this scene,
when she imagines the girl

00:47:48.876 --> 00:47:53.975
inside the house eating,
all that's outside the house is

00:47:53.975 --> 00:47:57.108
lost.
All she can see when she looks

00:47:57.108 --> 00:48:00.019
out her window is her own
reflection.

00:48:00.019 --> 00:48:07.159
But outside the house,
she is starved in to a kind of

00:48:07.159 --> 00:48:12.956
ethereal, full presence.
So the logic of absence--to

00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:17.574
bring it back around to this
question of identity and the

00:48:17.574 --> 00:48:22.439
identity of the voice--the logic
of absence starves away the

00:48:22.439 --> 00:48:26.150
person so that this fullness can
appear.

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:32.612
And I think this is the dark
side of a novel that so many

00:48:32.612 --> 00:48:37.690
people initially read as a
feminist novel,

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:42.308
a novel celebrating the
strength and the independence of

00:48:42.308 --> 00:48:45.845
women.
It turns to an aesthetic that

00:48:45.845 --> 00:48:49.699
has a kind of purchase in our
culture;

00:48:49.699 --> 00:48:56.221
that sense of anorexia blends
into the spiritual fullness of

00:48:56.221 --> 00:49:02.300
imagining memory as this
beautiful, lyrical presence.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.870
I think this is the complexity
of this novel;

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:08.413
this is the tension.
It's also, in many ways,

00:49:08.413 --> 00:49:11.091
its beauty.
So, now I believe we have

00:49:11.091 --> 00:49:11.680
an answer.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:18.940
Jonathan Safran Foer.
That will be our novel.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:20.850
Eli, congratulations.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:29.000
Thank you very much.
Have a wonderful break.

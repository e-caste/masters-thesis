00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.986
Professor Amy
Hungerford: So,

00:00:02.986 --> 00:00:04.240
today we will talk about The
Bluest Eye.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.026
This novel has a lot to do
with the questions that John

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:17.100
Barth was thinking about,
in a very different register,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.819
in Lost in the Funhouse.
This is,

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:26.681
of course, the story of a
little girl who is totally

00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:31.280
remade by a story that's told to
her,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.442
and I just want to point this
out to you, on page 182 of

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:40.648
The Bluest Eye.
This is the letter that

00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:45.220
Soaphead Church writes to God
explaining his action.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.840
He has, remember,
tricked Pecola in to thinking

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.866
that if something happens to the
dog that he sends her out to

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:59.654
feed,
it will be a sign that God has

00:00:59.654 --> 00:01:03.020
answered her prayer for blue
eyes.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.730
And, of course,
what he has given her to give

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.224
to the dog is poison.
So of course the dog dies,

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:13.989
and this convinces Pecola that
her prayers have been answered,

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:18.884
and it pushes her over the edge
in to something like

00:01:18.884 --> 00:01:23.793
schizophrenia.
But Soaphead is very satisfied

00:01:23.793 --> 00:01:28.515
with his work,
and this is how he describes

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:32.441
that work:
"I looked at that ugly

00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:35.379
little black girl and I loved
her.

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:40.220
I played You," he says to God,
"and it was a very good show.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.170
I have caused a miracle.
I gave her the eyes.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.520
I gave her two blue eyes,
cobalt blue,

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.233
a streak of it,
right out of Your own blue

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:56.030
heaven.
No one else will see her blue

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.761
eyes, but she will,
and she will live happily ever

00:02:00.761 --> 00:02:03.705
after.
I, I have found it meet and

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:06.619
right so to do." 
That last line,

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.541
"meet and right so to do," is
from the Anglican liturgy,

00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:13.750
or may also occur in the
Catholic liturgy.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.878
It refers to the Last Supper;
"It is meet and right so to do"

00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:22.483
to commemorate Christ's last
supper with his disciples

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:25.340
through the sacrament of the
Eucharist.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.502
So, he makes that story he
tells her, one,

00:02:30.502 --> 00:02:37.176
into a sacramental story,
as if he is giving her God's

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:40.752
gift.
But it is very patently a

00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:46.614
story, and we get that because
he says "she will live happily

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:51.181
ever after."
So, what he has invited her

00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:56.885
to do is to fully inhabit the
dream of the white aesthetic

00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:02.788
that her mother has absorbed
through the movies and has used

00:03:02.788 --> 00:03:07.713
in naming her.
Remember, in the novel we're

00:03:07.713 --> 00:03:14.299
told that Pecola's name is close
to a name from the 1934 movie

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.669
Imitation of Life,
which has a complicated story.

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.386
But it's about race relations,
and it features a little girl

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:30.262
named Peola who ends up passing
for white because she so hates

00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:35.333
the blackness of her mother.
So, Pecola's mother absorbed

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:39.192
that white aesthetic,
projected it on to her

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:42.921
daughter,
and her daughter finally so

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:49.009
longs to inhabit that story that
she goes to Soaphead Church.

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:53.960
And this is how she ends up,
and the cost of inhabiting that

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.513
story is derangement.
If John Barth's characters

00:03:58.513 --> 00:04:02.361
inhabit stories,
stories that precede them in

00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:06.633
the world-- Remember,
this is why it's important that

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:11.189
the narrator of the first story
in that collection is the sperm.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.943
The sperm comes already stocked
with the phrases and patterns of

00:04:17.943 --> 00:04:23.197
prior literature.
Well, Toni Morrison advances an

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:26.829
analysis that is not so
different.

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:29.990
Pecola came into the world,
essentially,

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.610
through her mother and the
society that surrounded her,

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.262
stocked with the story of white
aesthetics, the story that told

00:04:40.262 --> 00:04:45.460
her that she and her family were
ugly and irredeemable.

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.614
The quality of Morrison's
fiction could not be more

00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:58.440
different from the quality of
Barth's fiction,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.198
and I want to suggest to you
that that's because in

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:06.783
Morrison's fiction--this is her
first novel begun in the early

00:05:06.783 --> 00:05:09.868
'60s,
published in 1970--in this

00:05:09.868 --> 00:05:14.221
novel, she is absorbing
something from that '60s

00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:16.835
culture,
reflecting on it,

00:05:16.835 --> 00:05:20.870
that Barth kept very much at
arm's length.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:26.283
So, the abstract question of
what kinds of narratives produce

00:05:26.283 --> 00:05:31.336
the identity of a person becomes
for Morrison a political

00:05:31.336 --> 00:05:35.068
question.
Remember that divide I was

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:38.394
describing in the 1960s
political world,

00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:43.170
where some activists by the mid
'60s began to drop out of

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.604
activism because they were
convinced that it was more

00:05:47.604 --> 00:05:52.551
important to know themselves
than to actually go and try to

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:56.730
promote a positive program in
the world.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.220
And there was the
counterculture gaining steam,

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.004
advocating a playful engagement
with the world that would be

00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:13.139
uninterested in questions like
the Vietnam War.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.280
"Turn your back on the war,"
says Ken Kesey.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.970
Drop out.
Drop acid;

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.810
that's the thing you should be
doing.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.982
Well, the cultural politics of
the late '60s try to merge these

00:06:30.982 --> 00:06:35.610
two kinds of resistance to
convention.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.023
So it merges the cultural focus
of the counterculture--that's

00:06:40.023 --> 00:06:43.259
why it's called the
counterculture;

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:48.396
it produces a culture against
the prevailing culture--and that

00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:53.363
politically activist body of
thought coming out of the Civil

00:06:53.363 --> 00:06:58.500
Rights movement and the Black
Power movement in the '60s.

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.341
So, this produces a cultural
politics, the cultural politics

00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:07.430
of the late '60s and into the
'70s,

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.160
and I would say even up through
the culture wars of the 1990s.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.009
This is the legacy of the
1960s in literature.

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:23.179
So, Morrison takes the insights
of Barth, and she turns them to

00:07:23.179 --> 00:07:28.124
political purpose.
One of our questions today is

00:07:28.124 --> 00:07:32.607
going to be: Why does Toni
Morrison, in 1970,

00:07:32.607 --> 00:07:37.600
sit down to write a novel,
instead of a tract?

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:41.893
Why is she interested in
literature, as opposed to

00:07:41.893 --> 00:07:47.253
something like sociology?
She has such a strong and

00:07:47.253 --> 00:07:53.600
passionate desire for justice
for African Americans.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.170
Why is literature her chosen
venue?

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.164
Now, I'm sure there are a
thousand reasons,

00:07:58.164 --> 00:08:00.918
but we're going to--I'm going
to--bring some of them out of

00:08:00.918 --> 00:08:02.959
the novel that we can read right
there.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:06.763
Just without going into
biography or psychology,

00:08:06.763 --> 00:08:11.458
we're going to think about how
the novel presents itself as

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:16.233
doing a kind of work in the
world that Barth's writing never

00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:20.790
tries to do.
So, that's where I'm going to

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:25.456
go today.
Let me also point out that,

00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:30.329
like Pynchon,
Morrison wants to imagine the

00:08:30.329 --> 00:08:36.710
novel as a medium that can hold
the human within it.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.870
So, a second question that I
want to get at today is,

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.669
given that
commonality--Remember,

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.862
I ended my lecture on Pynchon
by arguing that sentiment

00:08:47.862 --> 00:08:50.889
remained important in Pynchon's
work;

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:56.078
despite all that word play,
all that self-conscious irony

00:08:56.078 --> 00:09:00.063
of the story,
all that humor at the level of

00:09:00.063 --> 00:09:03.213
names,
what really finally mattered

00:09:03.213 --> 00:09:08.057
was not that search for meaning,
but the moment when you could

00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:12.728
touch another human being.
And Pynchon is interested in

00:09:12.728 --> 00:09:16.789
certain kinds of essences--like
dandelion wine,

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:21.355
or tears, or the sailor's
mattress--that hold in them,

00:09:21.355 --> 00:09:24.887
in suspension,
the cycles and movements of

00:09:24.887 --> 00:09:29.597
human life.
Morrison has that same

00:09:29.597 --> 00:09:37.220
desire to hold the human in her
fiction, and so this is one

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.610
reason why Morrison chooses the
novel.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.172
This is the first of the
reasons: to hold the human in

00:09:46.172 --> 00:09:50.173
suspension in the novel.
Now it takes a very particular

00:09:50.173 --> 00:09:54.230
form, and if you think to the
passages about Pauline,

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:57.443
there is the section on
Pecola's mother,

00:09:57.443 --> 00:10:02.139
Pauline, where we see large
blocks of italics of her voice

00:10:02.139 --> 00:10:05.855
coming to us.
This is a very obvious example

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:09.019
of how that works in Morrison's
fiction.

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:14.526
This is an effort to let the
voice of the unheard speak

00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:19.300
through her fiction.
So, why write a novel instead

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.710
of writing a tract or becoming a
sociologist or a politician?

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.758
One reason, for Morrison,
is that the novel allows the

00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:33.340
voices of the oppressed to speak
in a way that they could not

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.514
otherwise.
This entails a certain

00:10:36.514 --> 00:10:41.009
assumption about her own
position as a writer.

00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:43.570
She writes from within a black
community she knows well.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:48.215
This novel is set in Lorain,
Ohio, her hometown,

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:53.453
and so she takes on that task
because she feels she is

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:57.799
equipped for it;
she can speak in a communal

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:03.241
voice or she can make her voice
available for the voices within

00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:08.218
the community that she knows.
Now, how many of you have

00:11:08.218 --> 00:11:10.549
read Beloved?
Ah, great.

00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:13.623
I usually don't put it on the
syllabus because I assume most

00:11:13.623 --> 00:11:16.156
people have read it.
But, if you recall,

00:11:16.156 --> 00:11:19.732
this effort to recover the
voice of the unheard is

00:11:19.732 --> 00:11:22.360
absolutely central to
Beloved;

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.009
it is the premise of
Beloved.

00:11:26.009 --> 00:11:29.240
Toni Morrison found an
account of a woman in a

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.196
newspaper in the mid nineteenth
century who tried to kill her

00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:36.756
children instead of allowing
them to be recaptured into

00:11:36.756 --> 00:11:39.842
slavery,
and she thought about what kind

00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:43.679
of story that woman would have
to tell about her life,

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:48.814
or what kind of story could be
told about that woman that the

00:11:48.814 --> 00:11:52.110
papers, that historians,
would never know and would

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.394
never be able to recover.
Fiction, because it is

00:11:55.394 --> 00:12:01.335
imaginative, gives you a way to
get at what academics of the

00:12:01.335 --> 00:12:06.470
traditional kind cannot transmit
about the past,

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.934
but also, in this novel,
about a life that is closer to

00:12:11.934 --> 00:12:16.909
her current moment,
the moment of writing.

00:12:16.909 --> 00:12:22.113
So, by including Pauline's
voice, she allows Pauline to

00:12:22.113 --> 00:12:27.675
begin to tell her own story of
how she became married to Cholly

00:12:27.675 --> 00:12:33.416
Breedlove and how she evolved in
to the fairly hateful woman that

00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:38.620
we see her to be when we see her
as Pecola's mother.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.912
You might find,
and I have to admit I myself

00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:48.401
find, that particular example
quite clunky in a literary

00:12:48.401 --> 00:12:51.789
sense.
Why did Morrison suddenly turn

00:12:51.789 --> 00:12:55.932
to those italicized blocks?
And, I don't know if you read

00:12:55.932 --> 00:12:59.362
the-- I think you have the
postscript, the afterword,

00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:02.990
that Morrison appended to this
edition of the novel.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.770
If you haven't read it,
I would suggest that you do.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:07.590
It's quite interesting.
She notes there that she

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.389
herself is very unhappy with
that section of the novel.

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:13.769
She herself finds it clunky
from the perspective of twenty

00:13:13.769 --> 00:13:17.537
years later.
She writes the afterword in

00:13:17.537 --> 00:13:20.204
1993.
So, it's unsatisfying to her,

00:13:20.204 --> 00:13:23.399
but there are more successful
versions of it.

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:25.223
And you see that,
for example,

00:13:25.223 --> 00:13:28.429
when the women are gathered
around Aunt Jimmy's bed,

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:31.950
and they're talking as she is
in her final sickness.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.414
And they're talking with one
another about their aches and

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:38.075
pains.
That's one example of how those

00:13:38.075 --> 00:13:43.260
voices come into the novel.
There are just many dozens of

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.055
these examples,
so any time you hear a

00:13:46.055 --> 00:13:50.232
character begin to speak,
you have that sense that you're

00:13:50.232 --> 00:13:53.692
hearing something that you
wouldn't otherwise hear if

00:13:53.692 --> 00:13:57.552
Morrison was not there to open
your ear to it and to embody

00:13:57.552 --> 00:14:00.849
those voices.
It's one of the great strengths

00:14:00.849 --> 00:14:04.370
of her writing is that ability
to embody the voice.

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:09.957
So, that's one reason why you
write a novel instead of being a

00:14:09.957 --> 00:14:14.125
sociologist.
Another reason is to push

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:18.801
the boundaries of what's
credible, to push those

00:14:18.801 --> 00:14:24.770
boundaries so far that you can
see the abject very clearly in

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.850
front of you within a literary
form,

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:38.129
and so she chooses Pecola as
the ugly child.

00:14:38.129 --> 00:14:41.590
She seems to have no redeeming
intelligence.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:47.163
She has no one who really loves
her, except maybe a few whores

00:14:47.163 --> 00:14:54.246
who live above her house.
She has no conversation that we

00:14:54.246 --> 00:14:58.399
really recall.
She doesn't say anything

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:02.586
particularly witty.
Probably what we remember her

00:15:02.586 --> 00:15:06.600
for is simply that desire to
have blue eyes.

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.432
We don't really get inside her
head, even, and so this is a

00:15:11.432 --> 00:15:16.680
place where Morrison's desire to
speak for those who can't speak

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.179
for themselves runs up against a
wall.

00:15:20.179 --> 00:15:24.116
But she's very interested in
what happens when the

00:15:24.116 --> 00:15:27.330
imagination hits up against that
wall.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:32.054
How far can we go towards
inhabiting the subject position

00:15:32.054 --> 00:15:36.044
of an abject person?
That's what she's testing in

00:15:36.044 --> 00:15:39.234
this novel.
And she herself speaks of a

00:15:39.234 --> 00:15:44.121
silence at the heart of it,
and that silence is in part the

00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:48.250
silence about Pecola's
experience of the rape,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:53.343
when she's raped by her father.
We don't really get a sense of

00:15:53.343 --> 00:15:57.299
what she thinks,
what she experiences.

00:15:57.299 --> 00:16:01.888
If you think again back to
Barth, remember that quotation

00:16:01.888 --> 00:16:07.049
of silence at the very center of
Menelaiad. So,

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:11.958
Morrison is again engaging a
problem that other writers are

00:16:11.958 --> 00:16:16.754
engaging at this time,
but she's setting it in a very

00:16:16.754 --> 00:16:22.192
specific historical moment with
very specific historical and

00:16:22.192 --> 00:16:27.353
political connotations and
implications coming out of her

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:31.106
examination.
So, silence is at the

00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:36.880
heart, but it's hedged around so
that we can see it as a silence.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:44.784
So, extremity does that for her.
I would argue that the third

00:16:44.784 --> 00:16:51.039
reason she uses the novel
instead of a tract is to

00:16:51.039 --> 00:16:54.887
generate sympathy.
And this, again,

00:16:54.887 --> 00:16:58.169
I was arguing,
is part of Pynchon's project.

00:16:58.169 --> 00:17:02.666
Usually, someone like Morrison
is separate in people's

00:17:02.666 --> 00:17:07.502
categories of contemporary
fiction from writers like Barth

00:17:07.502 --> 00:17:10.953
and Pynchon.
I am going to argue that they

00:17:10.953 --> 00:17:13.839
actually occupy much of the same
space.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:18.059
What does sympathy look like in
Morrison?

00:17:18.059 --> 00:17:22.352
Well, she sets herself a task
that, I would say,

00:17:22.352 --> 00:17:27.648
is almost as hard as the task
that Nabokov has set himself,

00:17:27.648 --> 00:17:31.210
and in fact maybe it's even
harder.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:37.660
Nabokov set himself the task of
making us like Humbert Humbert.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.230
Now how many of you liked
Humbert in the end?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.759
He's getting less popular as
the weeks go by.

00:17:45.759 --> 00:17:50.804
More of you seemed to like him
when we were in the throes of

00:17:50.804 --> 00:17:55.330
reading his seductive voice.
But Nabokov set himself the

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.380
task of seducing us with
Humbert's voice.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.250
Morrison,
as part of this novel,

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:08.996
sets herself the task of making
us sympathize with a drunk who

00:18:08.996 --> 00:18:15.190
has no verbal capacities who
rapes his own daughter.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:19.720
Now, does she succeed?
Well, let's take a look.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.718
On page 146,
we're a little ways into the

00:18:24.718 --> 00:18:31.717
story of Cholly Breedlove,
and this is in the scene where

00:18:31.717 --> 00:18:38.840
he has just left the funeral of
his aunt with a girl named

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.991
Darlene.
And they're playing and

00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:46.960
flirting and making out in the
field.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.450
She's gotten her clothes dirty: 
"You ain't dirty," he

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.900
says to her.
"I am too.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.448
Look at that."
She dropped her hands from the

00:18:59.448 --> 00:19:02.591
ribbon and smoothed out a place
on her dress where the grape

00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:05.660
stains were heaviest.
Cholly felt sorry for her.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.930
It was just as much his fault.
Suddenly he realized that Aunt

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:13.029
Jimmy was dead,
for he missed the fear of being

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:15.307
whipped.
There was nobody to do it

00:19:15.307 --> 00:19:18.259
except Uncle O.V.,
and he was the bereaved too.

00:19:18.259 --> 00:19:21.998
"Let me," he said,
and he rose to his knees,

00:19:21.998 --> 00:19:25.650
facing her, and tried to tie
her ribbon.

00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:29.507
Darlene put her hands under his
open shirt and rubbed the damp

00:19:29.507 --> 00:19:31.319
skin.
When he looked at her in

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:33.259
surprise she stopped and
laughed.

00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:36.170
He smiled and continued
knotting the bow.

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.640
She put her hands back under
his shirt.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:45.279
These little gestures that
Morrison grants to Cholly in

00:19:45.279 --> 00:19:50.710
this scene--tiny gestures of
tying the girl's bow,

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.481
leaning over her,
concerned for her looks as she

00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:58.252
goes back to her mother,
telling her--reassuring

00:19:58.252 --> 00:20:04.590
her--that she's not dirty,
and in a novel that is so full

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:12.321
of demonized cleanliness his
gentle assurance that her dress

00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:17.524
though stained,
is not dirty in the moral

00:20:17.524 --> 00:20:24.009
sense--this is a mark of
kindness, the mark of humanity.

00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:28.119
So, Morrison begins with small
details like this to build up

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:29.930
our sympathy for Cholly.

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:41.140
It gets more intense when he
meets his father in the city.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.050
This is on page 155.

00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:52.620
This is when he first sees him
playing craps in the alleyway:

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.274
A man in a light-brown
jacket stood at the far end of

00:20:58.274 --> 00:21:00.129
the group.
He was gesturing in a

00:21:00.129 --> 00:21:03.059
quarrelsome, agitated manner
with another man.

00:21:03.059 --> 00:21:06.069
Both of them had folded their
faces in anger.

00:21:06.069 --> 00:21:09.356
Cholly edged round to where
they stood, hardly believing he

00:21:09.356 --> 00:21:12.629
was at the end of his journey.
There was his father,

00:21:12.629 --> 00:21:16.660
a man like any other man,
but there indeed were his eyes,

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:20.730
his mouth, his whole head,
his shoulders lurched beneath

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:25.599
that jacket, his voice,
his hands, all real.

00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:27.920
They existed,
really existed,

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:31.186
somewhere, right here.
Cholly had always thought of

00:21:31.186 --> 00:21:33.876
his father as a giant of a man,
so when he was very close it

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:36.292
was with a shock that he
discovered that he was taller

00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:39.074
than his father.
In fact, he was staring at a

00:21:39.074 --> 00:21:42.853
balding spot on his father's
head, which he suddenly wanted

00:21:42.853 --> 00:21:45.554
to stroke.
While thus fascinated by the

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:49.131
pitiable clean space hedged
round by neglected tufts of

00:21:49.131 --> 00:21:52.839
wool, the man turned a hard,
belligerent face to him.

00:21:52.839 --> 00:21:57.056
[And then assumes that Cholly
has come at the behest of a

00:21:57.056 --> 00:22:01.197
woman that he's slept with to
squeeze money out of him.]

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:09.142
So, in this scene,
we once again see that humane

00:22:09.142 --> 00:22:13.616
touching impulse.
He wants to touch his father's

00:22:13.616 --> 00:22:16.019
head, touch the sign of his
father's mortality,

00:22:16.019 --> 00:22:18.369
the fact that his father is
growing older.

00:22:18.369 --> 00:22:23.082
He sees in his father's body
his own face,

00:22:23.082 --> 00:22:28.369
hands, voice,
and we can feel that with him.

00:22:28.369 --> 00:22:34.101
And then, when he flees from
that scene, finally,

00:22:34.101 --> 00:22:39.952
and soils himself,
he becomes another one of those

00:22:39.952 --> 00:22:45.143
abject characters.
And he goes to hide under a

00:22:45.143 --> 00:22:49.130
pier, finally bathes in a river
at night.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:55.315
This kind of detail gives us
two things: both the beginnings

00:22:55.315 --> 00:23:01.081
or another iteration of the
reason why he becomes who he

00:23:01.081 --> 00:23:05.065
becomes,
the drunk, the rapist,

00:23:05.065 --> 00:23:10.343
but it gives us more than that.
It gives us a sense of his

00:23:10.343 --> 00:23:12.902
complexity.
It makes us want to like him,

00:23:12.902 --> 00:23:15.595
and, in fact,
by this point I would argue

00:23:15.595 --> 00:23:19.499
that probably most readers do
like him at this point in the

00:23:19.499 --> 00:23:20.240
novel.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:30.140
Can Morrison sustain this to
the very end?

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.209
Well, in a way I want you to be
the judge, but if we look on

00:23:35.209 --> 00:23:40.450
206, I would argue that we're
beginning to see that effort.

00:23:45.109 --> 00:23:49.540
This is at the very end of the
novel, speaking of Pecola:

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:56.775
Oh, some of us "loved"
her [and that "love" is in

00:23:56.775 --> 00:23:59.650
quotations]
the Maginot Line and Cholly

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:02.829
loved her.
I'm sure he did.

00:24:02.829 --> 00:24:06.501
He, at any rate,
was the one who loved her

00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:09.366
enough to touch her,
envelop her,

00:24:09.366 --> 00:24:12.680
give something of himself to
her.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.390
But his touch was fatal,
and the something he gave her

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.470
filled the matrix of her agony
with death.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.230
Love is never any better than
the lover.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:27.676
Wicked people love wickedly,
violent people love violently,

00:24:27.676 --> 00:24:31.993
weak people love weakly,
stupid people love stupidly,

00:24:31.993 --> 00:24:35.480
but the love of a free man is
never safe.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.029
There is no gift for the
beloved.

00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:41.750
The lover alone possesses his
gift of love.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.541
The loved one is shorn,
neutralized,

00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:51.390
frozen in the glare of the
lover's inward eye.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.967
For one thing,
Morrison endows these sentences

00:24:54.967 --> 00:24:59.420
with a lyrical quality that
makes us feel their power.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.804
But there's one line she uses
to describe Cholly that I think

00:25:07.804 --> 00:25:11.887
trumps all the others,
and that's this one about the

00:25:11.887 --> 00:25:15.204
love of a free man:
"The love of a free man is

00:25:15.204 --> 00:25:21.663
never safe."
Safety is not exactly of value

00:25:21.663 --> 00:25:26.543
in this novel.
If it were, the safe white

00:25:26.543 --> 00:25:30.864
household in which Mrs.
Breedlove works would look a

00:25:30.864 --> 00:25:37.343
lot more appealing than it does.
There is a certain safety for

00:25:37.343 --> 00:25:42.674
Frieda and Claudia in their
intact household,

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:48.490
but there, too,
it is fraught with suffering.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:53.420
Their mother is cruel to them.
She yells at them.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.966
Safety is not really to be had
there, and the safety that is

00:25:57.966 --> 00:25:59.970
had comes at great cost.

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:06.471
When Cholly is described as
having freed himself,

00:26:06.471 --> 00:26:09.638
earlier in the novel,
part of that story which we

00:26:09.638 --> 00:26:14.059
don't get explicitly is that he
has learned to turn his hatred,

00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:19.294
finally, against the white men,
symbolized by the white men who

00:26:19.294 --> 00:26:24.359
discover him making love to
Darlene in that earlier scene.

00:26:24.359 --> 00:26:29.095
We're told that initially he
hates her instead of the white

00:26:29.095 --> 00:26:33.830
men, because hating the white
men would undo him to such an

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:39.299
extent he was not ready to see
that oppression for what it was.

00:26:39.299 --> 00:26:43.173
Later in his life,
we're told, he kills three

00:26:43.173 --> 00:26:45.657
white men.
We don't know the

00:26:45.657 --> 00:26:48.430
circumstances,
and at that moment,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.369
we're told that he's a free
man.

00:26:51.369 --> 00:26:56.313
Freedom,
when applied to a black man,

00:26:56.313 --> 00:27:01.009
cannot be a wholly negative
quality.

00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:06.564
In the context that Morrison
evokes, of a society still

00:27:06.564 --> 00:27:12.119
plagued by the remnants of
slavery, to call Cholly free

00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:18.228
can't be to dismiss him.
It gives a certain honor and

00:27:18.228 --> 00:27:22.978
weight to his anger.
And to re-evoke that word,

00:27:22.978 --> 00:27:27.993
to come back to that word,
in describing his love for the

00:27:27.993 --> 00:27:31.128
daughter he rapes,
I think, is quite

00:27:31.128 --> 00:27:36.111
controversial.
It suggests that there was some

00:27:36.111 --> 00:27:40.980
value in the thing of himself he
gave to her.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:46.326
Now, this is not exactly what
you'd want to call a feminist

00:27:46.326 --> 00:27:51.212
position, although Morrison
certainly is I would say a

00:27:51.212 --> 00:27:56.190
feminist writer in the largest
sense of that word.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.615
But what she has tried to do
here, in keeping with the

00:27:59.615 --> 00:28:03.170
challenge that I think she must
have set for herself,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:08.547
is to make us see Cholly
complexly enough to sympathize

00:28:08.547 --> 00:28:12.930
with him even after he commits
this crime.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:18.083
So she takes a certain kind of
risk, but that's why she does

00:28:18.083 --> 00:28:20.783
it.
She wants us to see him in a

00:28:20.783 --> 00:28:24.880
sympathetic light.
This is what a novel can do.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.509
It requires that lyrical
quality of voice;

00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:33.355
it requires the buildup of
history, and it requires,

00:28:33.355 --> 00:28:37.154
in this scene,
the return to that precise

00:28:37.154 --> 00:28:40.009
language.
So, a very common literary

00:28:40.009 --> 00:28:43.686
technique--we see it all the
time in the things that we read

00:28:43.686 --> 00:28:47.237
together--is to return to the
terms you used in an earlier

00:28:47.237 --> 00:28:50.540
moment to ring the changes on
those terms again,

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:54.772
to use that word.
Well, that's what Morrison uses

00:28:54.772 --> 00:28:59.079
to produce this sense of value
in Cholly at the end of the

00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:01.846
novel.
In this sense it participates

00:29:01.846 --> 00:29:05.013
or is in conversation with a
tradition of the

00:29:05.013 --> 00:29:07.819
nineteenth-century novel in
America.

00:29:07.819 --> 00:29:12.009
So, one of the most prestigious
novels of the nineteenth century

00:29:12.009 --> 00:29:16.000
is of course Harriet Beecher
Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.278
a hugely successful novel,
abolitionist novel whose aim

00:29:22.278 --> 00:29:28.123
was to create a sense of the
slave's humanity for white

00:29:28.123 --> 00:29:34.293
readers so that white readers
would become inspired to the

00:29:34.293 --> 00:29:40.356
abolitionist cause.
What was repulsive about that

00:29:40.356 --> 00:29:47.532
novel to someone like Morrison
is the starched white virtue and

00:29:47.532 --> 00:29:53.897
the starched white culture to
which the African American

00:29:53.897 --> 00:29:58.990
characters in the novel were
recruited.

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:02.863
So, in that novel,
their humanity and the sympathy

00:30:02.863 --> 00:30:07.763
that that would evoke from the
reader depended on their looking

00:30:07.763 --> 00:30:12.395
as white as possible,
and therefore there was this

00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:17.232
great privileging of the
light-skinned black in that

00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:21.879
novel and a sense of Christian
value redeeming the

00:30:21.879 --> 00:30:24.820
darker-skinned characters.

00:30:28.009 --> 00:30:30.559
They needed it--more,
it seems, than the

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:34.677
light-skinned characters--so the
darker your skin is in Uncle

00:30:34.677 --> 00:30:37.750
Tom's Cabin the more
religious you are.

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:44.150
So it's a whitewashing of the
African American figure.

00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:48.587
So, Morrison takes something of
the sympathetic project of

00:30:48.587 --> 00:30:52.402
Uncle Tom's Cabin and
that tradition of the

00:30:52.402 --> 00:30:56.918
nineteenth-century novel,
but she transforms it by making

00:30:56.918 --> 00:31:01.434
us sympathetic to someone like
Cholly who Harriet Beecher Stowe

00:31:01.434 --> 00:31:05.804
would put so far outside the
pale of humanity we wouldn't- he

00:31:05.804 --> 00:31:09.010
wouldn't even be visible on her
screen.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:17.850
So, this is her project.
Sympathy,

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:22.843
however, relies on some darker
and more ambiguous techniques

00:31:22.843 --> 00:31:26.059
that Morrison is also committed
to,

00:31:26.059 --> 00:31:29.690
and one of those is what I'm
going to call negativity.

00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:37.366
Morrison is very careful--in
this novel, especially--to talk

00:31:37.366 --> 00:31:43.050
about what people are not.
And you see an example of this

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.520
on page 55, when she's
describing the prostitutes.

00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:58.759
This is after she's been
telling stories--Miss Marie has

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:03.960
been telling stories--to Pecola
about her husband.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.740
They did not belong [This
is at the bottom of the page].

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.504
They did not belong to those
generations of prostitutes

00:32:10.504 --> 00:32:14.059
created in novels with great and
generous hearts,

00:32:14.059 --> 00:32:17.594
dedicated because of the horror
of circumstance to ameliorating

00:32:17.594 --> 00:32:19.740
the luckless,
barren life of men,

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:23.950
taking money incidentally and
humbly for their understanding.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:27.269
Nor were they from that
sensitive breed of young girl

00:32:27.269 --> 00:32:31.002
gone wrong at the hands of fate,
forced to cultivate an outward

00:32:31.002 --> 00:32:33.971
bitterness in order to protect
her springtime from further

00:32:33.971 --> 00:32:36.100
shock,
but knowing full well she was

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.650
cut out for better things and
could make the right man happy.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.773
Neither were they the sloppy,
inadequate whores who,

00:32:42.773 --> 00:32:45.099
unable to make a living at it
alone,

00:32:45.099 --> 00:32:48.406
turned to drug consumption and
traffic or pimps to help

00:32:48.406 --> 00:32:51.099
complete their stream of
self-destruction,

00:32:51.099 --> 00:32:55.746
avoiding suicide only to punish
the memory of some absent father

00:32:55.746 --> 00:32:59.359
or to sustain the misery of some
silent mother.

00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:02.831
Except for Marie's fabled love
for Dewey Prince,

00:33:02.831 --> 00:33:06.154
these women hated men,
all men, without shame,

00:33:06.154 --> 00:33:10.370
apology or discrimination.
They abused their visitors with

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.208
a scorn grown mechanical from
use: black men,

00:33:13.208 --> 00:33:15.725
white men, Puerto Ricans,
Mexican, Jews,

00:33:15.725 --> 00:33:19.069
Poles, whatever.
All were inadequate and weak.

00:33:19.069 --> 00:33:22.476
All came under their jaundiced
eyes and were the recipients of

00:33:22.476 --> 00:33:26.442
their disinterested wrath.
They took delight in cheating

00:33:26.442 --> 00:33:28.549
them.
On one occasion the town well

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:31.490
knew they lured a Jew up the
stairs, pounced on him,

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.291
all three, held him up by the
heels, shook everything out of

00:33:34.291 --> 00:33:36.759
his pants pockets and threw him
out of the window.

00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:39.297
Neither did they have respect
for women who,

00:33:39.297 --> 00:33:42.482
although not their colleagues
so to speak, nevertheless

00:33:42.482 --> 00:33:45.610
deceived their husbands
regularly or irregularly.

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:48.693
It made no difference.
Sugar-coated whores they called

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:51.430
them, and did not yearn to be in
their shoes.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.694
Their only respect was for what
they would have described as

00:33:54.694 --> 00:33:59.099
good Christian colored women,
the woman whose reputation was

00:33:59.099 --> 00:34:04.208
spotless and who tended to her
family, who didn't drink or

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:08.266
smoke or run around.
These women had their undying,

00:34:08.266 --> 00:34:11.309
if covert, affection.
They would sleep with their

00:34:11.309 --> 00:34:14.820
husbands and take their money,
but always with a vengeance.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.473
Nor were they protective and
solicitous of youthful

00:34:17.473 --> 00:34:19.602
innocence.
They looked back on their own

00:34:19.602 --> 00:34:22.742
youth as a period of ignorance
and regretted that they had not

00:34:22.742 --> 00:34:25.440
made more of it.
They were not young girls in

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.511
whores' clothing or whores
regretting their loss of

00:34:28.511 --> 00:34:31.607
innocence.
They were whores in whores'

00:34:31.607 --> 00:34:36.713
clothing, whores who had never
been young and had no word for

00:34:36.713 --> 00:34:41.360
innocence.
"Whores in whores' clothing."

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:45.909
That's the negativity,
one version of the negativity.

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:51.394
It refuses all those
conventional stock stories of

00:34:51.394 --> 00:34:56.923
what whores can be in the novel.
So, the very first instance of

00:34:56.923 --> 00:35:00.024
it singles out the novel:
"They did not belong to those

00:35:00.024 --> 00:35:03.356
generations of prostitutes
created in novels with great and

00:35:03.356 --> 00:35:05.699
generous hearts,"
and so on.

00:35:05.699 --> 00:35:09.236
But all those other versions
are equally fictional types of

00:35:09.236 --> 00:35:10.090
prostitutes.

00:35:13.469 --> 00:35:19.760
So she rejects the stock
literary cupboard of stories

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:23.795
about prostitutes.
"They were whores in whores'

00:35:23.795 --> 00:35:27.212
clothing."
There is an assertion of their

00:35:27.212 --> 00:35:31.120
opacity right there.
They are opaque to literary

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:34.870
embellishment.
They are what they are;

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:39.829
they just are whores.
But the negativity,

00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:42.952
the repeated "nors"--neither
were they this,

00:35:42.952 --> 00:35:46.070
nor were they that,
they were not this,

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:50.630
they were not that--it is a
kind of engine of narrative.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:56.710
And it limns the place where
they might come to stand in and

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:00.730
of themselves,
without embellishment.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:05.021
So, the effort to help us to
sympathize with marginal

00:36:05.021 --> 00:36:10.241
characters--Cholly Breedlove,
prostitutes--is an effort at

00:36:10.241 --> 00:36:15.849
limning a space where they can
stand in and of themselves,

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:20.750
and it creates narrative for us
to sympathize through.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:23.789
It creates a credibility for
her voice;

00:36:23.789 --> 00:36:28.183
it creates a sense of where
they can occupy a space,

00:36:28.183 --> 00:36:29.820
these characters.

00:36:33.719 --> 00:36:36.548
What's more,
Marie, as we know,

00:36:36.548 --> 00:36:42.110
is the one person who really
tells stories in this novel.

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:47.305
So Morrison also gives her a
special gift as a character,

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:51.110
a gift that Morrison's own gift
echoes.

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:56.380
She's allowed to tell stories
for Pecola's delight.

00:36:56.380 --> 00:37:02.659
She's the only one who does
that sort of thing for this

00:37:02.659 --> 00:37:05.104
child.
Pecola herself,

00:37:05.104 --> 00:37:09.570
though, is the ultimate
negativity, and this is on 205.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.550
You can see how this works.

00:37:14.679 --> 00:37:17.179
This is in the middle of that
page.

00:37:17.179 --> 00:37:21.235
All of our waste which we
dumped on her and which she

00:37:21.235 --> 00:37:25.081
absorbed, all of our beauty
which was hers first and she

00:37:25.081 --> 00:37:28.058
gave to us,
all of us, all who knew her,

00:37:28.058 --> 00:37:31.710
felt so wholesome after we
cleaned ourselves on her.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:36.170
We were so beautiful when we
stood astride her ugliness.

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:40.389
Her simplicity decorated us.
Her guilt sanctified us.

00:37:40.389 --> 00:37:42.269
Her pain made us glow with
health.

00:37:42.269 --> 00:37:45.460
Her awkwardness made us think
we had a sense of humor.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.720
Her inarticulateness made us
believe we were eloquent.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.794
Her poverty kept us generous.
Even her waking dreams we used

00:37:53.794 --> 00:37:58.239
to silence our own nightmares
and she let us and thereby

00:37:58.239 --> 00:38:02.216
deserved our contempt.
We honed our egos on her,

00:38:02.216 --> 00:38:06.597
padded our characters with her
frailty, and yawned in the

00:38:06.597 --> 00:38:12.469
fantasy of our strength.
Pecola is the embodiment of the

00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:19.155
negative, so she represents all
that the community does not want

00:38:19.155 --> 00:38:25.375
in itself: the excess blackness,
the ugliness that the white

00:38:25.375 --> 00:38:29.550
aesthetic says can't be changed
or redeemed.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:34.756
She represents the poverty that
they all strive to escape,

00:38:34.756 --> 00:38:39.939
or at least keep a bit at bay.
So, Pecola as the negativity

00:38:39.939 --> 00:38:44.537
is--through the whole novel,
in the structure of the whole

00:38:44.537 --> 00:38:49.539
novel--the absence that keeps
the narrative engine working.

00:38:49.539 --> 00:38:55.092
It has to keep working because
she's always there as the

00:38:55.092 --> 00:39:00.442
negative pole waiting to be
touched--even in the least

00:39:00.442 --> 00:39:04.380
bit--by the narrative's
revelation.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:10.348
So she embodies that,
the desire to know another

00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:15.497
person, which,
in Menelaiad, if

00:39:15.497 --> 00:39:20.530
you'll remember,
is Menelaus's undoing.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:23.980
He diddles on and on,
his voice asking,

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:25.070
"Why?
Why?

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:28.239
Why'd you choose me, Helen? Why?
Why do you love me?"

00:39:28.239 --> 00:39:35.184
He can't take any answer,
and it makes him ridiculous and

00:39:35.184 --> 00:39:40.546
it ruins his marriage.
That effort to know another

00:39:40.546 --> 00:39:45.230
person is much more than a
diddling on, in Morrison.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:49.879
That effort to know another
person isn't by definition put

00:39:49.879 --> 00:39:54.680
off limits, in Morrison.
The effort at trying is far

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.600
more honored.
The alienation from self which

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:03.744
produces a kind of irony and a
pleasure in humor in both Barth

00:40:03.744 --> 00:40:07.802
and Pynchon,
that self-consciousness that

00:40:07.802 --> 00:40:12.788
you see in both novels,
is not a source of humor in

00:40:12.788 --> 00:40:18.273
Morrison because the alienation
is produced by an unjust

00:40:18.273 --> 00:40:21.630
society.
It's not a laughing matter.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:26.368
It's not so much the universal
human condition as it is in

00:40:26.368 --> 00:40:29.610
Barth, to be alienated from
yourself.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:35.384
The self-alienation that Pecola
embodies as the negative is the

00:40:35.384 --> 00:40:39.390
product of oppression,
racial oppression.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:51.187
If there is an opportunity for
humor in Morrison's work,

00:40:51.187 --> 00:40:56.469
it's not going to come from
that fountain of irony.So,

00:40:56.469 --> 00:41:01.289
is irony dead in Morrison?
Well, maybe.

00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:06.386
If we see irony in Morrison's
work, it's in the specific local

00:41:06.386 --> 00:41:10.885
language of the characters,
and I would submit to you that

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:14.759
where we see something funny,
it's always with a tinge of

00:41:14.759 --> 00:41:18.327
darkness,
as in Claudia and Frieda's

00:41:18.327 --> 00:41:23.249
mother when she complains.
I don't know if you remember

00:41:23.249 --> 00:41:27.555
this scene when she complains
about Pecola drinking all the

00:41:27.555 --> 00:41:32.711
milk.
She goes on and on and on in

00:41:32.711 --> 00:41:40.530
this baroque aria of indictment
and it's funny,

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:44.989
and what we're told about this
mother is that on her grumpy

00:41:44.989 --> 00:41:48.967
days this is what she does.
She complains about the whole

00:41:48.967 --> 00:41:52.584
world until she's got everything
covered, she's covered every

00:41:52.584 --> 00:41:56.019
complaint she could possibly
have, and then she sings.

00:41:56.019 --> 00:42:00.630
And the fact that she turns to
singing after having done that

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:05.145
suggests a kind of continuity,
that there is an operatic,

00:42:05.145 --> 00:42:08.070
artistic quality to the
complaining.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:14.428
And Morrison gives it to us in
her voice, and that is the kind

00:42:14.428 --> 00:42:19.119
of pleasure that Morrison's
novels give us;

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:23.360
that's the kind of humor that
her novels give us.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.882
It's not going to be the funny,
sad situation of the

00:42:27.882 --> 00:42:33.018
perpetually alienated Ambrose.
It's going to be a woman in her

00:42:33.018 --> 00:42:37.022
kitchen who's out of milk now,
doesn't know where she's

00:42:37.022 --> 00:42:40.443
getting the next quart,
and yet, and yet,

00:42:40.443 --> 00:42:45.539
uses that verbal facility to
make something in its place,

00:42:45.539 --> 00:42:48.575
in the place of the milk that's
not there, something to

00:42:48.575 --> 00:42:50.880
entertain her daughters as they
listen.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:01.121
So, there is a deeper,
even darker side,

00:43:01.121 --> 00:43:05.582
I would suggest,
to the generation of sympathy

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:10.525
in Morrison's novels.
And that's the last point I

00:43:10.525 --> 00:43:15.274
want to make for you today,
and I think we can see it

00:43:15.274 --> 00:43:19.750
most--well--I'm going to show
you one example,

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:22.130
and then quick flip to the more
important one.

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:28.486
On 176, when Soaphead reaches
for his ink to write his letter

00:43:28.486 --> 00:43:32.300
to God, a bottle of ink,
we are told,

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:37.280
was on the same shelf that held
the poison.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:42.125
Writing and poison are
extremely close in this novel,

00:43:42.125 --> 00:43:47.624
and--what's more--something
like reading and being raped are

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:55.620
very close to one another.
And you can see this on 200.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:05.717
In the conversation between
Pecola and her alienated other

00:44:05.717 --> 00:44:11.735
self, that other voice keeps
prodding her about a second

00:44:11.735 --> 00:44:13.896
rape,
the second time,

00:44:13.896 --> 00:44:18.093
keeps saying "the second time."
We are not shown that in the

00:44:18.093 --> 00:44:21.713
narrative, so why is this
something that enters in to it

00:44:21.713 --> 00:44:22.240
here?

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:32.754
The other voice says to her: 
"I wonder what it would

00:44:32.754 --> 00:44:34.637
be like," [referring to the
rape.]

00:44:34.637 --> 00:44:36.521
"Horrible," [says Pecola's
voice.]

00:44:36.521 --> 00:44:38.070
"Really?"
"Yes.

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.897
Horrible."
"Then why didn't you tell Mrs.

00:44:40.897 --> 00:44:42.960
Breedlove?"
"I did tell her."

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.239
"I don't mean about the first
time.

00:44:45.239 --> 00:44:48.988
I mean about the second time
when you were sleeping on the

00:44:48.988 --> 00:44:50.800
couch."
"I wasn't sleeping.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:57.159
I was reading." 
This is a weird moment.

00:44:57.159 --> 00:45:00.389
You could read that as an odd
detail.

00:45:00.389 --> 00:45:04.112
She really means that there was
a second rape and it happened

00:45:04.112 --> 00:45:07.431
not when she was sleeping,
although she had said that

00:45:07.431 --> 00:45:10.289
before, but when she was reading
on the couch.

00:45:10.289 --> 00:45:13.897
But I think there is a darker
meaning to this,

00:45:13.897 --> 00:45:18.706
that it's actually the act of
reading that is folded into the

00:45:18.706 --> 00:45:21.973
act of being raped.
And this is not,

00:45:21.973 --> 00:45:26.331
I think, foreign to the whole
setup of this novel,

00:45:26.331 --> 00:45:29.800
that reading of that little
passage,

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.068
because of course,
as you will have noticed,

00:45:33.068 --> 00:45:37.401
you have the Dick and Jane
primer at the beginning of each

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:41.429
chapter made into nonsense by
being run together.

00:45:41.429 --> 00:45:45.439
So, remember in the first few
pages of the novel you have

00:45:45.439 --> 00:45:47.840
"Here is a house.
It is green and white.

00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:50.635
It has a red door.
It is very pretty" and then

00:45:50.635 --> 00:45:52.260
mother, father,
Dick and Jane.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:55.900
This is the white aesthetic
embodied in the primer.

00:46:00.039 --> 00:46:05.361
The message is that when you
learn to read you are imbuing

00:46:05.361 --> 00:46:09.190
yourself, imbibing the white
aesthetic.

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:14.504
If you are a young black girl
learning to read,

00:46:14.504 --> 00:46:21.090
you are bringing into yourself
a deadly kind of poison,

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.896
and it's the poison that
destroys Pecola's mother and

00:46:24.896 --> 00:46:28.410
Pecola herself in her desire for
the blue eye.

00:46:34.079 --> 00:46:39.283
The primer is run together so
that we can see how it becomes

00:46:39.283 --> 00:46:43.340
nonsensical in the context of
Pecola's life.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.613
But there is a profound
indictment of reading,

00:46:46.613 --> 00:46:50.287
and so you have to ask yourself
what kind of reader does

00:46:50.287 --> 00:46:53.532
Morrison want?
And this, I think,

00:46:53.532 --> 00:46:58.781
has a complex answer.
It is not just that Morrison

00:46:58.781 --> 00:47:04.775
wants to indict a certain kind
of reading on the Dick and Jane

00:47:04.775 --> 00:47:07.380
model.
It's deeper than that.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:12.482
In her Nobel-Prize-winning
speech, she writes about her

00:47:12.482 --> 00:47:15.594
ideal reader.
Actually, I think it's either

00:47:15.594 --> 00:47:17.989
in one of her essays,
or in that speech.

00:47:17.989 --> 00:47:22.820
She writes about her ideal
reader being what she calls "the

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:27.340
illiterate reader."
By that she means the reader

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:33.177
not stocked up already with the
imaginative inventory of the

00:47:33.177 --> 00:47:36.589
Western canon,
a reader who instead has some

00:47:36.589 --> 00:47:38.260
sense of an oral tradition.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:47.315
But there is more to it than
that, to imagine a reader who is

00:47:47.315 --> 00:47:52.911
that poorly prepared to meet a
novel of the ambition that

00:47:52.911 --> 00:47:57.392
Morrison's novels embody.
If you read Beloved

00:47:57.392 --> 00:48:01.710
without knowing how to close
read the way we do in class,

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:05.019
it's extremely hard to get a
lot out of it.

00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:08.430
There are very difficult
passages in that novel.

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:12.889
She learned a lot from Faulkner.
That's one of the ways that she

00:48:12.889 --> 00:48:16.713
learned to incorporate voices
into her novel in a way that

00:48:16.713 --> 00:48:20.974
they would sit by themselves,
seemingly unmediated by a

00:48:20.974 --> 00:48:23.239
narrator.
She learned a lot from Virginia

00:48:23.239 --> 00:48:25.955
Woolf.
She wrote her MA thesis on

00:48:25.955 --> 00:48:29.824
Woolf and Faulkner,
on suicide in Woolf and

00:48:29.824 --> 00:48:33.573
Faulkner,
so she herself is highly

00:48:33.573 --> 00:48:39.630
educated, deeply trained in the
modernist avant-garde,

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:46.608
and yet she looks for a reader
that has rejected all of that

00:48:46.608 --> 00:48:52.976
that she calls on so skillfully.
Reading is such a vexed

00:48:52.976 --> 00:48:57.931
activity for Morrison that she
represents both reading and

00:48:57.931 --> 00:49:03.059
writing as something like the
equivalent of being the victim

00:49:03.059 --> 00:49:04.190
of rape.

00:49:07.219 --> 00:49:13.306
That pushes the idea of
sympathy into another register

00:49:13.306 --> 00:49:17.422
altogether.
It's a text that is essentially

00:49:17.422 --> 00:49:22.245
theorizing itself as reaching
out to you--not in the sense

00:49:22.245 --> 00:49:26.730
just of making you feel like
Cholly's an okay guy,

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:33.384
that he's human and not some
monster--but actually reaching

00:49:33.384 --> 00:49:39.809
out to you and doing to you what
Cholly did to Pecola.

00:49:39.809 --> 00:49:43.542
That's an odd thing to do to
your own book,

00:49:43.542 --> 00:49:48.874
so I want you to think about
the kind of reader that Morrison

00:49:48.874 --> 00:49:53.066
imagines,
and what her novel is trying to

00:49:53.066 --> 00:49:57.013
do with and to that reader.
I will come back to some of

00:49:57.013 --> 00:49:59.420
these themes when we talk about
Woman Warrior on

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.420
Wednesday.

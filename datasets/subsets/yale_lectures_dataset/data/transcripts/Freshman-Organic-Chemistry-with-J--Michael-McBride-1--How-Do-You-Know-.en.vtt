00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.637
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:09.012
So for 150 years organic
chemistry courses have tended to

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:12.180
acquire a daunting reputation.
 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.210
So you need help.
 

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.534
I know you're very able,
but trust me,

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:19.540
you need help.
 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.670
So where do you the help?
 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.430
The PowerPoints are available
on the Web.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.236
How many of you've already seen
the PowerPoint for today,

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:26.590
just so I have some idea?
 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.160
So about a quarter of you maybe.
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.618
Okay, but anyhow,
so your lecture notes are

00:00:31.618 --> 00:00:33.326
important,
but you don't have to worry

00:00:33.326 --> 00:00:35.464
about getting everything down
because you can download it from

00:00:35.464 --> 00:00:35.850
the Web.
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.716
And I do it on a Mac,
but I try my best to make it

00:00:39.716 --> 00:00:44.056
compatible with PCs and even
with the free PC Viewer for

00:00:44.056 --> 00:00:45.240
PowerPoint.
 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.880
So you should be able to see it.
 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.360
But I don't see it on a PC.
 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.716
So if anything doesn't come
through, let me know so that I

00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:54.710
can fix it.
 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.320
Okay then, in-class discussion
is very important,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.439
and if you're really,
really shy and can't

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:04.329
participate in discussion in
class,

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.780
then email me a question. Okay?
 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.201
There's the course website,
which is our substitute for a

00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:11.629
text.
 

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:14.887
It also includes the
PowerPoint, and there's the link

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.019
for it, and when go there you'll
see it develop.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:20.698
The current website is mostly
last year's course,

00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:24.105
so it'll change a little bit as
we go along, but fundamentally

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:25.110
it's the same.
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.358
If you want to look ahead
you'll see pretty much what's

00:01:28.358 --> 00:01:29.080
coming up.
 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.757
There'll be assigned problems
and questions,

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:35.060
and also there are previous
exams and answers keys.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.322
All these things are on the
course website so you'll get

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:40.330
help there.
 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.220
But one thing that's really
special is the course Wiki.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.697
This is the third year we've
done it and the second year in a

00:01:46.697 --> 00:01:48.090
really systematic way.
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.650
So you get assigned to do,
to cover a couple frames of the

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.690
PowerPoint.
 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.224
So those are the ones you
really need to take careful

00:01:57.224 --> 00:02:01.099
notes on, and write them up,
and help other people too;

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:02.950
that's the nature of a Wiki,
as you know.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.438
How many of you have
participated in a Wiki?

00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:10.688
Well, by next week it will be
all of you.

00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:14.363
Okay, but in order to get
credit for it you have to get it

00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.490
by the night after the lecture.
 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.613
So for the lecture today you
have to get it by late tomorrow

00:02:19.613 --> 00:02:21.520
night, 36 hours after the
lecture.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.330
This is so other students can
use it.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.110
Okay, in the spring there'll
probably be a textbook.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.408
I haven't really decided yet.
 

00:02:29.408 --> 00:02:30.860
These things cost an arm and a
leg.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.378
Maybe we can find one that's
used, an older edition.

00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:39.810
It doesn't make any difference
except to the publishers.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.175
Okay, also there's personal
help, like from me,

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:46.615
and there's -- and you can find
my phone number,

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:49.250
email and so on,
on the website.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.456
Also the two graduate student
TAs who are assigned to the

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:57.848
course,
who are Filip Kolundzic --

00:02:57.848 --> 00:03:04.454
Filip, back there --
and Nathan Schley,

00:03:04.454 --> 00:03:07.468
not Schlay, Schley.
 

00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:12.378
So these are graduate students
in chemistry and they run these

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:14.150
discussion sections.
 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.878
Typically you have a 50-minute
discussion section.

00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:21.265
But the way we run it in this
course is that on two different

00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:23.750
nights a week there are two-hour
sessions.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.158
You can come to any part of it
you want to.

00:03:26.158 --> 00:03:28.924
You can go to both of them,
you can go to four hours a week

00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:31.116
if you want to,
or you can go to none at all if

00:03:31.116 --> 00:03:31.878
you want to.
 

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:36.026
So really, for the bookkeeping
purposes of the department you

00:03:36.026 --> 00:03:38.240
have to sign up for a section.
 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.382
Sign up for any section you
want to and then come to what's

00:03:43.382 --> 00:03:44.889
useful for you.
 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.789
But also, the reason you pay
the big bucks to come here,

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.373
is not to hear me,
it's to interact with the other

00:03:50.373 --> 00:03:51.060
students.
 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.090
That's a really big help.
 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.128
So, form study groups.
 

00:03:55.128 --> 00:03:58.264
And in fact you can get advice
from previous people who've

00:03:58.264 --> 00:03:59.310
taken the course.
 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.750
That's on the Web.
 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.104
Also there's some of them,
there's a list of them on the

00:04:04.104 --> 00:04:07.460
Web who would be happy to talk
to you if you need it.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.938
And we're blessed with three
alumni,

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:14.348
seniors who took this course as
freshmen,

00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:16.670
who act as what are called peer
tutors,

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.430
and they'll run a session
Sunday evening,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.723
from eight to ten p.m.
 

00:04:19.723 --> 00:04:20.959
is the current plan.
 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.048
We'll announce the rooms for
these things on the website and

00:04:24.048 --> 00:04:25.879
probably by email to you as
well.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:33.170
So let me introduce Tina Ho and
Drew Klein and Justin Kim.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.449
So they'll be a big help to you
too.

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.160
So there's plenty of personal
help, so use it.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.199
These are the dates we're going
to have exams.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.279
There are ten lectures and then
an exam;

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:46.160
nine lectures, exam;
nine lectures, exam.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.110
Actually, if you check,
you'll find that --

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.629
and also you get 50 points for
participation in the Wiki,

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.250
and the total is 650 points,
that's what your exam is based

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.649
on.
 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:00.947
Actually this doesn't cover --
it's nine lectures that are

00:05:00.947 --> 00:05:03.569
covered on the exam,
but the previous Wednesday part

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.108
of the lecture is going to be a
guest lecturer that's going to

00:05:06.108 --> 00:05:07.149
be here just that day.
 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:09.762
So we're putting the exam off
and it'll only cover the

00:05:09.762 --> 00:05:12.399
previous material;
not that that's a big deal.

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:16.079
Okay, and the semester grade is
biased;

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:19.201
that is, it's based on this,
your total score here,

00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:20.449
out of 650 points.
 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.096
But if you're near a cutoff and
you were very good about turning

00:05:24.096 --> 00:05:27.278
in your problem sets and so on,
then we boost you up.

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:33.447
We don't grade problem sets but
it's worthwhile to do them,

00:05:33.447 --> 00:05:37.170
and they might make a
difference.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.829
So where are we going with this?
 

00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:41.569
What are the goals of our
Freshman Organic Chemistry?

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.946
In fact, if you click that in
your PowerPoint you'll get taken

00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:47.326
to that site,
but it's right on the website,

00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:48.709
you'll see it anyhow.
 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.666
First is to learn the crucial
facts and vocabulary of Organic

00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:54.627
Chemistry --
after all that's what we think

00:05:54.627 --> 00:05:57.911
we're here for --
and to develop a theoretical

00:05:57.911 --> 00:06:01.240
intuition about how bonding
works.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.329
This is the goal for,
the primary goal of the first

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:08.410
half of the fall semester is to
learn how bonding works really,

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.370
and that relates then to
molecular structure;

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.608
and also how bonding changes,
and that of course is

00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:17.709
reactivity.
 

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:21.541
But under the line there are a
lot of other things that we do

00:06:21.541 --> 00:06:24.990
in Freshman Organic Chemistry
that are arguably just as

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.055
important,
like make the scientific

00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:31.389
transition from school to
university.

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.060
In school they try to teach you
what people know.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.220
In the University you try to
develop new knowledge.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.896
So you need a different mindset
for that, and we hope this

00:06:39.896 --> 00:06:41.399
course helps you develop that.
 

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:45.158
So learn from Organic
Chemistry, which is really in my

00:06:45.158 --> 00:06:49.060
view a model science,
how to be a creative scientist.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.913
So here's a creative scientist
by anybody's measure,

00:06:51.913 --> 00:06:52.810
Louis Pasteur.
 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.720
And in the 1880s he said this
in French,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.119
but in English it says,
"Knowing to be astonished

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:04.160
by something is the mind's first
step toward discovery."

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.612
Another way of putting that is
that the characteristic comment

00:07:08.612 --> 00:07:13.209
on making a real discovery is
not "Eureka",

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:16.803
it's "Huh,
that's funny." So

00:07:16.803 --> 00:07:19.990
that's what you really have to
learn;

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.547
learn enough about how
chemistry works and form this

00:07:23.547 --> 00:07:27.732
picture in your mind that when
something happens that doesn't

00:07:27.732 --> 00:07:29.983
fit,
you know to be astonished so

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:31.899
that you can discover something.
 

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:35.850
That's exactly what Pasteur
did, and we'll talk about that

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:36.959
in the course.
 

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:40.394
And even perhaps more
important, to develop good

00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:44.560
taste, so that you can
distinguish sense from nonsense;

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.454
there's certainly more nonsense
floating around than sense,

00:07:47.454 --> 00:07:50.100
and being able to tell the
difference is important.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.620
The way you do it is to develop
good taste by looking at a lot

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.028
of good examples and then you're
aware of how crummy the bad

00:07:57.028 --> 00:07:58.009
examples are.
 

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:01.788
So we're going to try to
emphasize good examples,

00:08:01.788 --> 00:08:02.970
and have fun.
 

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.720
So and as we go along,
if you have questions,

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.360
break in.
 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.000
You'll do this much more as we
go along, I know.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.547
So the class really is mostly
about theory,

00:08:16.547 --> 00:08:21.613
although we describe the basis
for the theory and spend a lot

00:08:21.613 --> 00:08:24.569
of time trying to make it real.
 

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:29.319
But we require Chemistry 126L,
the lab.

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:32.655
This is the only chemistry
course that requires you to take

00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:33.980
a lab simultaneously.
 

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.842
So I hope you're all enrolling
in that because there'll be a

00:08:36.842 --> 00:08:39.269
certain day that you want to be
able to take it.

00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:42.950
It's just one afternoon a week,
three hours or whatever it is,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.389
but you want to get your first
choice, so line up soon.

00:08:46.389 --> 00:08:50.279
You'll be accommodated but it's
just more convenient if you get

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.659
it arranged earlier.
 

00:08:51.659 --> 00:08:52.759
But why?
 

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:57.158
Because lab answers the really
big question.

00:08:57.158 --> 00:09:01.587
And the big question was
brought home to me by my son,

00:09:01.587 --> 00:09:04.428
John McBride,
in his third year.

00:09:04.428 --> 00:09:07.272
This was the beginning of the
third year, and his mother and I

00:09:07.272 --> 00:09:08.668
didn't know what was coming.
 

00:09:08.668 --> 00:09:12.878
For the next year,
maybe 15, maybe 20 times a day,

00:09:12.878 --> 00:09:17.429
he said, "How do
you know?"

00:09:17.429 --> 00:09:19.730
So here's John this last summer.
 

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:25.129
He's now 38 and he has his own
three-year-olds to say that to

00:09:25.129 --> 00:09:25.668
him.
 

00:09:25.668 --> 00:09:27.291
And he doesn't say,
"How do you

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:28.019
know?" anymore.
 

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:29.062
He now says,
"How do you

00:09:29.062 --> 00:09:30.070
know?"
 

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.129
Okay?
 

00:09:32.129 --> 00:09:35.232
But that is the main question,
how do you know what these

00:09:35.232 --> 00:09:37.340
things that they told you in
school?

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.014
Well, there are four ways we
can talk about of knowing,

00:09:41.014 --> 00:09:44.554
and two of them are shown on
this manuscript from the

00:09:44.554 --> 00:09:46.529
Carolingian book painter.
 

00:09:46.529 --> 00:09:50.700
If we zoom in on the top frame,
here's Moses on Mount Sinai.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.808
So the first way of knowing is
divine authority.

00:09:55.808 --> 00:09:58.900
Here he's going to be the --
here's the graduate student here

00:09:58.900 --> 00:09:59.879
getting the word.
 

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:02.580
Here's the teaching assistant
over on the left perhaps.

00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.740
&gt;
 

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.090
Aaron, right?
 

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.753
And then he comes down from
Sinai, to see the class,

00:10:09.753 --> 00:10:12.038
the Children of Israel.
 

00:10:12.038 --> 00:10:16.440
So here's another kind of
authority, which is human

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.960
authority interpreting the
scriptures.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.839
And here you can see the class;
the guys are going like

00:10:23.839 --> 00:10:25.620
"huh."
 

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.720
And the teaching assistant is
off on the side still.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.090
But this doesn't make it.
 

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:34.639
Science is not faith based.
 

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:40.250
There may be other things you
know that way but not science.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.125
Science ignores divine
authority and it ignores human

00:10:44.125 --> 00:10:46.956
authority;
not that they might not exist

00:10:46.956 --> 00:10:49.230
but they don't relate to
science.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:53.958
Now as you walked in today,
did you notice these things

00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.009
over here?
 

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:58.083
There's an Honor Roll of
Chemists, and in fact we'll use

00:10:58.083 --> 00:11:02.394
that a lot this semester,
and in particular one of the

00:11:02.394 --> 00:11:06.019
people on there is Michael
Faraday,

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:08.269
who started in a very humble
way.

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:13.719
He was a book binder's
apprentice and he bound this

00:11:13.719 --> 00:11:16.351
book --
not this particular copy but

00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:18.543
this book --
which is called

00:11:18.543 --> 00:11:21.870
Conversations on
Chemistry.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.970
He bound the first edition.
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:29.528
This one is a later edition.
 

00:11:29.528 --> 00:11:32.148
So you see it's
Conversations on Chemistry in

00:11:32.148 --> 00:11:35.379
which Elements of that Science
are Familiarly Explained and

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:37.330
Illustrated by Experiments.
 

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:43.210
And who's the author?
 

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.921
J.L.***Comstock;
he's actually not the author,

00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:49.259
he's the guy who stole it.
 

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:51.605
He stole it from a woman,
Mrs. Marcet,

00:11:51.605 --> 00:11:53.950
in England, who wrote this
book,

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.418
which was the most popular
textbook --

00:11:55.418 --> 00:12:00.375
it was written for girls -- but
it was the most popular textbook

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:03.094
in all chemistry,
for the first half of the

00:12:03.094 --> 00:12:04.009
nineteenth century.
 

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:06.379
It went through like 20-some
editions.

00:12:06.379 --> 00:12:10.559
And here you see at the
beginning it's a dialogue,

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:14.996
a conversation between Mrs. B
and Caroline and Emily,

00:12:14.996 --> 00:12:19.433
and it's fun to see this here,
what Emily says at the

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:20.970
beginning.
 

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.980
"To confess the truth
Mrs. B,

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:27.100
I'm not disposed to form a very
favorable idea of chemistry,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.639
nor do I expect to derive much
entertainment from it."

00:12:30.639 --> 00:12:32.614
But in the long run,
as you can imagine,

00:12:32.614 --> 00:12:34.639
they have a lot of fun with
chemistry.

00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:37.840
It was a wonderful book,
and still is.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.418
But he was binding it,
and read it.

00:12:41.418 --> 00:12:46.087
And look what he says about
this, as his introduction to be

00:12:46.087 --> 00:12:50.192
the leading experimental
scientist of the nineteenth

00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:52.903
century:
"Do not suppose I was a

00:12:52.903 --> 00:12:56.230
very deep thinker or was marked
as a precocious person.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.246
I was a very lively,
imaginative person and could

00:12:59.246 --> 00:13:03.269
believe in the Arabian Knights
as easily as the encyclopedia,

00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:07.139
but facts were important to me
and saved me.

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:12.350
I could trust a fact and always
cross-examined an assertion.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.360
So when I questioned
Mrs. Marcet's book by such

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.090
little experiments as I could
find means to perform,

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:22.889
and found it true to the facts,
as I could understand them,

00:13:22.889 --> 00:13:27.869
I felt I had got hold of an
anchor in chemical knowledge and

00:13:27.869 --> 00:13:29.980
clung fast to it."
 

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.779
So the experiments were what
did it.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:39.110
So the third way of knowing is
by experimental observation.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.149
And here's Richard Feynman.
 

00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:44.408
How many of you've heard of
Richard Feynman?

00:13:44.408 --> 00:13:47.081
He was a really great
physicist, wrote a wonderful

00:13:47.081 --> 00:13:49.808
textbook as well as getting all
sorts of prizes.

00:13:49.808 --> 00:13:52.638
He spoke to the National
Science Teachers Association in

00:13:52.638 --> 00:13:55.235
1966 saying,
"Learn from science that

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:57.000
you must doubt the experts.
 

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.320
Science is the belief in the
ignorance of experts.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.524
When someone says,
'Science teaches such and

00:14:04.524 --> 00:14:07.580
such,' he's using the word
incorrectly.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:12.009
Science doesn't teach it;
experience teaches it.

00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:14.529
If they say to you,
'Science has shown such and

00:14:14.529 --> 00:14:17.269
such,' you might ask,
'How does science show it?

00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:19.200
How did the scientists find out?
 

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.649
How, what, where?'
 

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:26.846
Not science has shown,
but this experiment or this

00:14:26.846 --> 00:14:29.500
effect has shown."
 

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:36.730
Now, why do we quote Feynman?
 

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.669
Because he's an expert.
 

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:39.669
&gt;
 

00:14:39.669 --> 00:14:42.139
Wrong.
 

00:14:42.139 --> 00:14:44.374
Though literally,
expert,

00:14:44.374 --> 00:14:48.556
the etymology of expert,
is it means someone who has

00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:50.070
done experiments.
 

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:56.850
We quote him because what he
says makes sense.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.908
So logic is the fourth way of
knowing things.

00:14:59.908 --> 00:15:03.883
So the two ways that we know
things in chemistry,

00:15:03.883 --> 00:15:07.360
or in science,
are experiment and logic.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.822
And the lecture is a little bit
more focused on logic and the

00:15:10.822 --> 00:15:12.960
lab is more focused on
experiment,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.960
and you get an unbalanced view
if you do one without the other.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.785
Okay, so modern science got
underway in the seventeenth

00:15:20.785 --> 00:15:21.308
century.
 

00:15:21.308 --> 00:15:25.370
There's the seventeenth
century, 1600 to 1700.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:29.831
And 1638 was when New Haven
Colony was founded,

00:15:29.831 --> 00:15:33.418
and 1701 was when Yale was
founded.

00:15:33.418 --> 00:15:35.839
So that's when everything got
underway, just when this

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.299
enterprise was beginning here.
 

00:15:37.299 --> 00:15:40.820
Here we are.
 

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.942
If you go back 100 years you
get to quantum,

00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:47.250
quantization by Planck;
and we'll talk about that.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.966
And if you go back another 100
years you get to Lavoisier and

00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.408
oxidation;
and we'll talk about that.

00:15:53.408 --> 00:15:56.186
And if you get another 100
years you get to Newton and

00:15:56.186 --> 00:15:58.581
gravitation;
and we'll talk a little bit

00:15:58.581 --> 00:15:59.320
about that.
 

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.149
And if you go back a little
more, another 100 years,

00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:04.551
you get to Copernicus and the
revolution of the heavenly

00:16:04.551 --> 00:16:08.399
bodies,
and Columbus and navigation,

00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:12.090
and Luther and the Reformation.
 

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:14.860
And these things all have
something in common.

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.993
As Robert Hooke wrote,
"The seventeenth

00:16:17.993 --> 00:16:20.908
century"
(his age) "was an age,

00:16:20.908 --> 00:16:24.259
of all others,
the most inquisitive."

00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:28.216
All these things have to do
with people inquiring into how

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:31.548
people know things and finding
out new things.

00:16:31.548 --> 00:16:37.056
And in particular an important
figure was Francis Bacon and his

00:16:37.056 --> 00:16:39.009
Instauration.
 

00:16:39.009 --> 00:16:40.897
Now you may not know The
Instauration so well,

00:16:40.897 --> 00:16:41.658
let's look at that.
 

00:16:41.658 --> 00:16:44.490
Here's Francis Bacon,
there are his years.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:48.340
He was Elizabethan and Jacobean.
 

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.177
He was almost exactly
contemporary with Shakespeare,

00:16:53.177 --> 00:16:54.980
and with Galileo.
 

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.730
He went to school,
to university,

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.019
at Cambridge.
 

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:04.513
And here's a cartoon that shows
him -- it's a modern cartoon --

00:17:04.513 --> 00:17:08.058
imagining him in a class at
Cambridge.

00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:10.220
Because he wrote of his tutors
at Cambridge:

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.621
"They were men of sharp
wits, shut up in their cells of

00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:18.549
a few authors,
chiefly Aristotle,

00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:20.288
their dictator.
 

00:17:20.288 --> 00:17:22.844
All the philosophy of
nature" (philosophy meant

00:17:22.844 --> 00:17:25.900
science in those days) "all
the philosophy of nature,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.898
which is now received,
is either the philosophy of the

00:17:30.898 --> 00:17:34.390
Grecians or that of the
alchemists.

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.826
The one is gathered out of a
few vulgar"

00:17:36.826 --> 00:17:40.150
(that means ‘common' of
course) "observations,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:44.920
and the other out of a few
experiments of a furnace.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:49.513
The one never faileth to
multiply words,

00:17:49.513 --> 00:17:55.640
and the other ever faileth to
multiply gold."

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.240
So here's the book he wrote,
The Instauration.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.670
That's the frontispiece for it.
 

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.308
This picture's from the
Beinecke Library;

00:18:02.308 --> 00:18:03.710
I went down and got a picture
of the book.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:07.960
Notice it was published in 1620.
 

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.808
What else happened then?
 

00:18:11.808 --> 00:18:15.170
That's when the Pilgrims came
over, right?

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:18.010
So the title of the book,
rather small under his name and

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.990
title as Lord Chancellor of
England,

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:22.991
is Instauratio Magna,
which means the Great

00:18:22.991 --> 00:18:23.849
Restoration.
 

00:18:23.849 --> 00:18:25.309
Restoration of what?
 

00:18:25.309 --> 00:18:27.259
Of the way of knowing.
 

00:18:27.259 --> 00:18:30.527
A bigger, a part of it,
it's called the Novum

00:18:30.527 --> 00:18:33.586
Organum,
which is -- and it develops the

00:18:33.586 --> 00:18:36.986
inductive scientific method,
based on experiment,

00:18:36.986 --> 00:18:39.588
to replace Aristotelian
deduction,

00:18:39.588 --> 00:18:41.838
which is you maybe did one
experiment sometime,

00:18:41.838 --> 00:18:44.808
and then you reason everything
from that.

00:18:44.808 --> 00:18:46.630
But he says no,
you have to do more

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.380
experiments.
 

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.750
Now there's an interesting
thing here.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.989
One of the devices on the
title, on this frontispiece,

00:18:53.989 --> 00:18:55.670
is two pillars.
 

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:59.970
What in the world are they
doing there?

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.529
Well they're the same pillars
that you see on this.

00:19:04.529 --> 00:19:06.893
That's a piece of eight;
you know, Treasure

00:19:06.893 --> 00:19:08.500
Island, pieces of eight?
 

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:12.741
See it's eight reales,
and it came from the silver of

00:19:12.741 --> 00:19:17.509
Mexico;
it was minted in Mexico City.

00:19:17.509 --> 00:19:21.694
So and there you see the same
pillars and on them it says

00:19:21.694 --> 00:19:26.690
plus ultra;
more beyond.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:34.970
Beyond what?
 

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:39.240
What are the pillars?
 

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.470
Pardon me?
 

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.789
Student: Spain and
Africa.

00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:44.634
Prof: Yes,
it's Africa and Spain,

00:19:44.634 --> 00:19:47.519
but it's the Pillars of
Hercules,

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.230
which are the mouth of the
Mediterranean,

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.259
the old Classical World.
 

00:19:51.259 --> 00:19:55.013
So there's the Mountain of
Moses in Morocco and the

00:19:55.013 --> 00:19:58.920
Mountain of Tarik,
which is the name of Gibraltar.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.448
So here's the Mediterranean,
the Classical World of

00:20:02.448 --> 00:20:06.613
Aristotle, and you can sail out
into the New World and bring

00:20:06.613 --> 00:20:08.660
back silver, for example.
 

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:14.838
There's danger of course.
 

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:17.740
But look at what it says at the
bottom.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.250
What will be brought back?
 

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.259
Not just silver.
 

00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:27.378
Multi pertransibunt &amp;
augebitur scientia

00:20:27.378 --> 00:20:31.582
--"Many will pass through
and knowledge will be

00:20:31.582 --> 00:20:33.230
increased."
 

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.676
So we go beyond Aristotle into
experimentally based science and

00:20:37.676 --> 00:20:39.828
knowledge will be increased.
 

00:20:39.828 --> 00:20:43.221
So here's some quotes from
The Instauratio

00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:44.019
Magna.
 

00:20:44.019 --> 00:20:49.285
"That wisdom which we have
derived principally from the

00:20:49.285 --> 00:20:52.318
Greeks" (no offense,
okay?)

00:20:52.318 --> 00:20:56.710
"is but like the boyhood
of knowledge,

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.204
and has the characteristic
property of boys:

00:21:01.204 --> 00:21:05.910
it can talk but it cannot
generate;"

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:10.023
"…it is but a
device for exempting ignorance

00:21:10.023 --> 00:21:11.670
from ignominy."
 

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.935
That means it's a way of hiding
your ignorance,

00:21:14.935 --> 00:21:17.278
and we'll see examples of that.
 

00:21:17.278 --> 00:21:19.154
We'll talk about,
in Lecture 11,

00:21:19.154 --> 00:21:22.737
about correlation energy,
and we'll talk in Lecture 32

00:21:22.737 --> 00:21:26.423
about strain energy,
and you'll see that both of

00:21:26.423 --> 00:21:31.160
these are just words that are
used to hide our ignorance.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.614
"…the end which
this science of mine proposes is

00:21:34.614 --> 00:21:37.315
the invention,
not of arguments,

00:21:37.315 --> 00:21:41.529
but of arts"
(ways of doing things).

00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:43.565
"…not so much by
instruments"

00:21:43.565 --> 00:21:45.509
(although new instruments are
important,

00:21:45.509 --> 00:21:49.108
like microscopes and so on)
"as by experiments,

00:21:49.108 --> 00:21:53.034
skillfully and artificially
devised for the express purpose

00:21:53.034 --> 00:21:56.078
of determining the point in
question."

00:21:56.078 --> 00:22:01.672
(So artificial experiments
designed to decide a question;

00:22:01.672 --> 00:22:03.170
experiments.)
 

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.801
"And this will lead to the
restoration of learning and

00:22:06.801 --> 00:22:07.930
knowledge."
 

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:12.573
So followers of Bacon
established The Royal Society in

00:22:12.573 --> 00:22:16.778
1662, just after Charles was
restored to England,

00:22:16.778 --> 00:22:19.670
after the period of Cromwell.
 

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.532
And there was a history written
of The Royal Society,

00:22:23.532 --> 00:22:26.653
a book about this thick,
published in 1667,

00:22:26.653 --> 00:22:29.700
only five years after it was
founded.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.250
Why did they publish a history
so soon?

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.536
Well let's look at this,
the frontis itpiece of this

00:22:35.536 --> 00:22:35.848
book.
 

00:22:35.848 --> 00:22:40.705
Here's the late Francis Bacon,
who was said to be Artium

00:22:40.705 --> 00:22:44.390
Instaurator,
the Restorer of the Arts.

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:47.019
And here's the President of The
Royal Society,

00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:49.710
the mathematician,
Viscount Brouncker,

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.000
and here in the middle,
being crowned with laurel,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.640
is Charles II.
 

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.608
Why do they have him up on a
pedestal?

00:22:56.608 --> 00:23:00.496
Because they're hoping,
as scientists have before and

00:23:00.496 --> 00:23:04.755
ever since, to extract some
money out of the government to

00:23:04.755 --> 00:23:06.400
do their research.
 

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.625
They actually never got it from
Charles but it wasn't for lack

00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:10.259
of trying.
 

00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:14.334
And this is why they wrote the
history, to try to make the case

00:23:14.334 --> 00:23:15.778
for being supported.
 

00:23:15.778 --> 00:23:20.080
Okay, now let's look at all the
good things that will come from

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.440
science, from The Royal Society.
 

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.460
In the background can you see
what that is?

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:27.420
We'll blow it up.
 

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.210
Here there's a hint to it on
the bookshelf.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.271
If you look really fine on the
bookshelf you can see that some

00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:36.670
of them have writing on the
spine.

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:40.069
Do you see what that one is?
 

00:23:40.069 --> 00:23:43.250
Can anybody read it?
 

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:47.140
What?
 

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.839
What science book do you think
they might have had?

00:23:49.839 --> 00:23:51.539
Student:  Copernicus.
 

00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:54.109
Prof: Copernicus, right?
 

00:23:54.109 --> 00:23:58.029
So astronomy;
that's a telescope in the back.

00:23:58.029 --> 00:24:05.470
Okay, or over here on the wall,
what's that thing?

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.509
It's a clock.
 

00:24:06.509 --> 00:24:09.259
Why is it shaped like a piece
of pie?

00:24:09.259 --> 00:24:10.618
Student: Because it has
a pendulum inside.

00:24:10.618 --> 00:24:13.907
Prof: Ah,
because it has a pendulum

00:24:13.907 --> 00:24:14.630
inside.
 

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.170
So horology, making good clocks.
 

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.269
Okay, or here,
what's that thing?

00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:23.130
It's hard for you to know.
 

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:23.869
Student: Solar.
 

00:24:23.869 --> 00:24:25.868
Prof: It's a wind gauge.
 

00:24:25.868 --> 00:24:29.068
It has a vane inside that it
blows on -- and you can tell

00:24:29.068 --> 00:24:32.440
from how far it goes on the
scale how strong the wind is.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.068
So meteorology.
 

00:24:35.068 --> 00:24:39.380
And back here on the pillar,
what are those things for?

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.119
Students: A compass.
 

00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:46.279
Prof: For cartography.
 

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:50.555
Now what do all these things
have in common that they're

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.809
going to do for Charles II?
 

00:24:52.809 --> 00:24:54.376
Astronomy --
Student:  For the

00:24:54.376 --> 00:24:54.588
records.
 

00:24:54.588 --> 00:24:56.403
Prof: Good clocks,
meteorology,

00:24:56.403 --> 00:24:57.529
cartography,
what --

00:24:57.529 --> 00:24:59.288
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:24:59.288 --> 00:25:03.604
Prof: They all have to
do with navigation,

00:25:03.604 --> 00:25:06.838
with making England strong at
sea.

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:12.430
Now back here is another
science, Chemistry.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.900
That doesn't seem to have
anything to do with navigation.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.390
Why would Chemistry be
important to Charles?

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.750
Student:  War.
 

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.700
Prof: Look at it.
 

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.430
Student:  War.
 

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.710
Prof: To make gun powder.
 

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.483
There was a chapter about gun
powder in The History of the

00:25:25.483 --> 00:25:26.410
Royal Society.
 

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.390
Okay, and up here at the top is
the motto,

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.859
which is Nullius in
Verba, which comes from this

00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:35.646
quote from Horace,
and what it says is,

00:25:35.646 --> 00:25:38.088
"Lest you ask who leads
me,

00:25:38.088 --> 00:25:40.118
in what household I lodge"
(that is,

00:25:40.118 --> 00:25:44.080
what philosophy I advocate)
"there is no master in

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:47.088
whose words I am bound to take
an oath.

00:25:47.088 --> 00:25:51.115
Wherever the storm forces me,
there I put in as a

00:25:51.115 --> 00:25:52.288
guest."
 

00:25:52.288 --> 00:25:55.888
So it's the experiment,
not the philosopher,

00:25:55.888 --> 00:25:58.818
that leads you to the
conclusion.

00:25:58.818 --> 00:26:03.940
So Nullius in Verba is
'in the words of none.'

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.383
And, in fact,
the original name of The Royal

00:26:07.383 --> 00:26:11.946
Society was The Royal Society
for the Improving of Natural

00:26:11.946 --> 00:26:14.269
Knowledge by Experiments.
 

00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:17.568
Okay, so we're going to see,
as the course goes along,

00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:20.618
important experiments that
really decided questions,

00:26:20.618 --> 00:26:24.167
and in fact Bacon's most
important kind of experiment was

00:26:24.167 --> 00:26:28.160
one that "finally decides
between two rival hypotheses,

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.180
proving the one and disproving
the other."

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.983
So you can do all sorts of
experiments and just be

00:26:33.983 --> 00:26:37.318
collecting butterflies --
no, I don't mean to insult

00:26:37.318 --> 00:26:41.200
people who collect butterflies,
it's a fine thing to do.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.067
But there's something special
about experiments that really

00:26:45.067 --> 00:26:47.470
are designed to answer a
question.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.788
Now Bacon devised a name for
such experiments,

00:26:51.788 --> 00:26:55.196
and they're based on this
model, that you have a road that

00:26:55.196 --> 00:26:58.663
diverges and you need to know
which way to go between these

00:26:58.663 --> 00:26:59.798
two hypotheses.
 

00:26:59.798 --> 00:27:03.950
What do you need,
to know which way to go?

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:08.826
You need a sign,
or this was a cross that you

00:27:08.826 --> 00:27:11.710
mounted at a crossroads.
 

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:15.348
So the Latin name for cross is
crux.

00:27:15.348 --> 00:27:19.710
Do you see what they call the
experiment?

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.960
Crucial.
 

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.980
That's the origin of the word
crucial, right?

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.440
It's the one that tells you
which way to go.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:33.660
Okay, so here is Isaac Newton
and he's holding something.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.890
Can you see what he's holding
in his hand?

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.130
Student: A candle.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.930
Prof: I'll give you a
hint.

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:44.670
It's a prism.
 

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.118
Why is he holding a prism?
 

00:27:46.118 --> 00:27:50.630
Because that was his crucial
experiment;

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:53.970
and here's his diagram in that
experiment with a prism in it.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.465
He called it the
Experimentum Crucis,

00:27:56.465 --> 00:27:58.150
taking the word from Bacon.
 

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.756
Okay, so light came in through
a hole in the window,

00:28:01.756 --> 00:28:05.008
through a lens,
and then got bent and dispersed

00:28:05.008 --> 00:28:07.130
into the different colors.
 

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:11.621
So you get a spectrum here on
this thing, the different

00:28:11.621 --> 00:28:12.368
colors.
 

00:28:12.368 --> 00:28:17.769
Now there's the question,
how does the prism make color?

00:28:17.769 --> 00:28:22.036
Hooke and Descartes thought
that light was a train of pulses

00:28:22.036 --> 00:28:25.578
and as it goes through something
like a prism,

00:28:25.578 --> 00:28:28.739
or as it reflects from a thin
layer of oil on water or

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:32.234
something like that,
that it changes the timing of

00:28:32.234 --> 00:28:35.460
the pulses and therefore changes
the color.

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:40.895
But Newton thought that the
colors were pre-existing,

00:28:40.895 --> 00:28:44.660
and the prism just separates
them.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.509
And this was his crucial
experiment to decide between

00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:48.660
those two theories.
 

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.788
You see what he did?
 

00:28:51.788 --> 00:28:57.157
He drilled a hole through the
board and let through only the

00:28:57.157 --> 00:29:00.980
red light, and put a second
prism there.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.673
And he wrote here,
three times -- he wrote it

00:29:04.673 --> 00:29:08.872
here, and also here,
and also here -- nec variat

00:29:08.872 --> 00:29:14.490
lux fracta colorem;
which means "the broken

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:19.160
light does not change its
color."

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.906
So this proved to Newton,
at least at that time,

00:29:23.906 --> 00:29:29.058
that light is a substance,
not a train of pulses.

00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:31.910
What do you think of that proof
now?

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.089
You think light is a substance
or a train of pulses?

00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:34.660
Students:  Both.
 

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:35.410
Student: Neither.
 

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.029
Prof: But at least you
can see that in terms then,

00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:41.288
that was a crucial experiment,
a really important experiment,

00:29:41.288 --> 00:29:44.922
and that's the kind of
experiments we'll try to talk

00:29:44.922 --> 00:29:46.490
about in the course.
 

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:48.970
Experiments are indispensable
in Organic Chemistry.

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.719
It's an empirical science based
on observation,

00:29:51.719 --> 00:29:54.230
and that's why you have to take
the lab.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:58.223
But so is logic -- that was
number three and number four of

00:29:58.223 --> 00:30:01.528
the ways of knowing -- logic is
important too.

00:30:01.528 --> 00:30:06.750
So believe what I tell you here
only when it makes sense to you.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.190
Don't just cram it in,
make sure it makes sense.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:16.108
But what if it doesn't?
 

00:30:16.108 --> 00:30:18.797
Now here's how to succeed in
Chem.

00:30:18.797 --> 00:30:23.194
125, and we'll take as our
model science student Samuel

00:30:23.194 --> 00:30:24.009
Pepys.
 

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:28.098
How many people have heard of
Samuel Pepys?

00:30:28.098 --> 00:30:30.180
Have you heard of him as a
scientist?

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:31.190
Student: I don't
remember. 

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:32.288
Prof: What did you hear
of him as?

00:30:32.288 --> 00:30:35.118
What do you associate with
Samuel Pepys?

00:30:35.118 --> 00:30:39.240
Student: Newton-Pepys
Problems.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.594
Prof: Right in this
period, in the heart of the

00:30:42.594 --> 00:30:43.670
science growth.
 

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:49.780
But what you know him for was
his diary, which tells all about

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.190
life, everyday life in
Restoration London.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:57.482
He was actually,
as a sixteen-year-old,

00:30:57.482 --> 00:31:01.470
present when Charles I was
beheaded in 1649.

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:04.109
Now what's the connection?
 

00:31:04.109 --> 00:31:06.549
Do you know where this is?
 

00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:12.858
Anybody been there?
 

00:31:12.858 --> 00:31:15.960
Dixwell, Goffe and Whalley
Avenues,

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:21.425
those are named for three of
the 50 judges that condemned

00:31:21.425 --> 00:31:25.424
Charles I to be beheaded,
and they were the only ones

00:31:25.424 --> 00:31:28.243
that lasted very long,
after the Restoration,

00:31:28.243 --> 00:31:32.557
and they lasted because they
fled to New England and were

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.328
hidden on West Rock.
 

00:31:34.328 --> 00:31:38.250
All these roads are heading
west toward West Rock.

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.359
Okay, so that's a tie-in to the
same period.

00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:41.608
But anyway, he got his B.A.
 

00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:45.759
in Cambridge in 1654 and a
Master's in 1656.

00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:48.275
And he got a good job,
he became Clerk of the Acts for

00:31:48.275 --> 00:31:50.709
the Navy Board,
which meant he was the guy that

00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:52.848
purchased everything for the
Royal Navy,

00:31:52.848 --> 00:31:55.239
all the rope,
all the tar,

00:31:55.239 --> 00:31:57.818
all the lumber and so on.
 

00:31:57.818 --> 00:32:01.760
And on July Fourth,
1662 -- it's the fourth of July

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:06.568
but it's more than 100 years
before that became relevant --

00:32:06.568 --> 00:32:09.060
he writes in his diary,
"By and by comes

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.874
Mr. Cooper,
mate of the Royall

00:32:10.874 --> 00:32:13.327
Charles,
of whom I intend to learn

00:32:13.327 --> 00:32:15.849
mathematiques,
and do begin with him to-day,

00:32:15.849 --> 00:32:18.509
he being a very able
man… After an hour's

00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:22.016
being with him at arithmetique
(my first attempt being to learn

00:32:22.016 --> 00:32:24.702
the multiplication-table);
we then parted till

00:32:24.702 --> 00:32:25.490
tomorrow."
 

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:29.537
So here was the guy doing all
the purchasing for the Royal

00:32:29.537 --> 00:32:32.236
Navy and he didn't know
multiplication,

00:32:32.236 --> 00:32:33.869
let alone division.
 

00:32:33.869 --> 00:32:35.368
But he worked hard at it.
 

00:32:35.368 --> 00:32:39.640
July ninth, five days later:
He's "Up by four o'clock,

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.779
and at my multiplicacion-table
hard,

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:44.490
which is all the trouble I meet
withal in arithmetique."

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:47.759
He can do the other things
pretty well.

00:32:47.759 --> 00:32:50.558
July eleven:
"Up by four o'clock and

00:32:50.558 --> 00:32:54.759
hard at my multiplicacion-table,
which I am now almost master

00:32:54.759 --> 00:32:55.670
of."
 

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.799
Christmas -- so six months
later: "…so to my

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:01.148
office,
practicing arithmetique alone

00:33:01.148 --> 00:33:04.584
and making an end of last
night's book with great content

00:33:04.584 --> 00:33:08.450
till eleven at night and so home
to supper and to bed."

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:14.403
Or a year later -- so he was
motivated and he was diligent;

00:33:14.403 --> 00:33:15.838
that's good.
 

00:33:15.838 --> 00:33:17.153
A year later,
on a Sunday:

00:33:17.153 --> 00:33:20.252
"…I below by myself
looking over my arithmetique

00:33:20.252 --> 00:33:21.618
books and timber rule.
 

00:33:21.618 --> 00:33:24.746
So my wife arose anon and she
and I all the afternoon at

00:33:24.746 --> 00:33:27.473
arithmetique,"
* "and

00:33:27.473 --> 00:33:31.778
she has come to do Addition,
Subtraction and Multiplicacion

00:33:31.778 --> 00:33:34.785
very well,
and so I purpose not to trouble

00:33:34.785 --> 00:33:37.018
her yet with
Division…"

00:33:37.018 --> 00:33:37.609
Right?
 

00:33:37.609 --> 00:33:38.608
&gt;
 

00:33:38.608 --> 00:33:43.690
So he worked with a study
partner, and that's crucial.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:48.460
And Isaac Newton -- does
anybody recognize this book?

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:49.369
Student:  Yes, sure.
 

00:33:49.369 --> 00:33:50.108
Prof: Right?
 

00:33:50.108 --> 00:33:52.648
The Mathematical Principles
of Science, of Natural

00:33:52.648 --> 00:33:53.480
Philosophy.
 

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:59.078
But there's an interesting
thing on the title page.

00:33:59.078 --> 00:34:03.505
Samuel Pepys is the one who
gave permission to publish that

00:34:03.505 --> 00:34:07.930
book, because he was the
president of The Royal Society.

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:13.090
Now six years later Pepys
encountered a problem with dice.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.242
The reason was he went to
coffee shops every night for

00:34:16.242 --> 00:34:19.730
dinner and they'd gamble,
and people proposed various

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:22.083
kinds of bets,
and he couldn't figure out this

00:34:22.083 --> 00:34:25.630
one,
so he wrote Newton for help.

00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.481
So this was the problem that he
wrote to Newton,

00:34:28.481 --> 00:34:30.179
twenty-second of November.
 

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:34.610
So A has six dice in a box,
and he has to throw a Six by

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:38.114
throwing it;
B has 12 dice and he has to

00:34:38.114 --> 00:34:42.070
fling two Sixes;
and C has 18 Dice but he has to

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.659
get 3 Sixes to win.
 

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:46.260
The question,
"Whether B and C have not

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.860
as easy a Taske at A,
at even luck?"

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.621
That is, if the dice aren't
loaded or anything,

00:34:50.621 --> 00:34:51.579
who has the better bet?
 

00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:54.239
&gt;
 

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:59.909
How many people think that it's
the same?

00:34:59.909 --> 00:35:01.650
Don't be shy.
 

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:05.639
How many think it's A?
 

00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:08.250
How many think B?
 

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:11.289
How many think C?
 

00:35:11.289 --> 00:35:14.650
How many don't really have any
opinion at all?

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.429
Good, that wins.
 

00:35:16.429 --> 00:35:19.643
Okay, so he wrote this letter
to try to get help on his bets

00:35:19.643 --> 00:35:21.641
from Newton,
and Newton replied,

00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:24.681
four days later,
"What is the expectation

00:35:24.681 --> 00:35:27.530
or hope of A to throw every time
one six,

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.679
at least,
with six dyes?"

00:35:29.679 --> 00:35:31.719
So you get two sixes you still
win;

00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:34.090
that wasn't clear in the
original statement.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.094
So he says, "If we
formulate the question that way,

00:35:37.094 --> 00:35:39.990
it appears by an easy
computation that the expectation

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.554
of A is greater than B or C;
that is, the task of A is the

00:35:44.554 --> 00:35:46.010
easiest."
 

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.110
There's the answer.
 

00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:51.740
So Pepys replied on the sixth
of December: "You give it

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:54.079
in favour of the Expectations of
A,

00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:58.989
&amp; this (as you say) by an
easy Computation.

00:35:58.989 --> 00:36:03.556
But yet I must not pretend to
soe much Conversation with

00:36:03.556 --> 00:36:06.134
Numbers,
as presently to comprehend as I

00:36:06.134 --> 00:36:08.347
ought to doe,
all the force of that wch you

00:36:08.347 --> 00:36:10.579
are pleas'd to assigne for the
Reason of it,

00:36:10.579 --> 00:36:14.117
relating to their having or not
having the Benefit of all their

00:36:14.117 --> 00:36:15.030
Chances."
 

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:22.387
So he wasn't ashamed to admit
that he didn't really understand

00:36:22.387 --> 00:36:24.800
-- that's crucial.
 

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.722
"And therefore,
were it not for the trouble it

00:36:27.722 --> 00:36:30.643
must have cost you,
I could have wished for a sight

00:36:30.643 --> 00:36:32.690
of the very Computation."
 

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.239
Can you show me how to figure
it out?

00:36:35.239 --> 00:36:39.289
And he wanted that because
somebody might change the terms

00:36:39.289 --> 00:36:42.059
of the bet and then he wouldn't
know.

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:43.309
He wanted really to understand.
 

00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:46.389
He insisted on proof.
 

00:36:46.389 --> 00:36:49.295
So this is two of the pages
from Newton's correspondence of

00:36:49.295 --> 00:36:51.300
the letter that he wrote in
response,

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:55.429
and you can see that Pepys
certainly got more than he had

00:36:55.429 --> 00:36:56.610
bargained for.
 

00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:59.286
"So to compute this I set
down the following progressions

00:36:59.286 --> 00:37:00.119
of numbers."
 

00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:04.143
So you can go through all this
and you get complicated

00:37:04.143 --> 00:37:09.293
quotients here,
and it turns out that A has

00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:16.608
31,031 chances out of 46,656,
or 0.6651 chance of winning,

00:37:16.608 --> 00:37:22.260
and B has this,
which is 0.6187;

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.170
A wins.
 

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:29.949
So is Pepys satisfied with this?
 

00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:33.271
Pepys writes back and he says,
"Why?"

00:37:33.271 --> 00:37:33.849
Right?
 

00:37:33.849 --> 00:37:39.974
"I cannot bear the Thought
of being made Master of a Jewell

00:37:39.974 --> 00:37:42.989
I know not how to wear."
 

00:37:42.989 --> 00:37:46.431
So he's willing to swallow his
pride to search for really solid

00:37:46.431 --> 00:37:47.320
understanding.
 

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:52.880
Now compare this with a comment
we got at an end-of-semester

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.179
evaluation in January a year
ago.

00:37:56.179 --> 00:37:58.784
"I never went to his
office hours for help because I

00:37:58.784 --> 00:38:00.739
felt like he would make me feel
stupid,

00:38:00.739 --> 00:38:03.059
because he's superior to me in
chemistry."

00:38:03.059 --> 00:38:05.130
I hope I'm superior to you in
chemistry.

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:06.119
&gt;
 

00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:09.295
I'm not superior as a person,
but I hope I'm superior in

00:38:09.295 --> 00:38:09.989
chemistry.
 

00:38:09.989 --> 00:38:12.829
You're paying me the big bucks
because of that.

00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:18.599
So swallow your pride and ask
someone for help.

00:38:18.599 --> 00:38:19.489
Follow Pepys.
 

00:38:19.489 --> 00:38:23.155
So read "Pepys and
Newton" and get together to

00:38:23.155 --> 00:38:27.329
do problems for Monday,
and contribute to the Wiki when

00:38:27.329 --> 00:38:29.139
you're asked to do so.
 

00:38:29.139 --> 00:38:30.340
So here are problems.
 

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.239
For Friday the problems are
optional but very helpful.

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:36.856
One is find out which two class
members have the rooms nearest

00:38:36.856 --> 00:38:40.119
you so that you can maybe use
them as study partners.

00:38:40.119 --> 00:38:42.530
You don't have to use them,
use anybody,

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.250
but use someone,
don't try to go it alone.

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:45.460
Two.
 

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.474
What are the three most common
items of advice from course

00:38:48.474 --> 00:38:49.110
veterans?
 

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.108
So if you click there,
or go to the webpage,

00:38:52.108 --> 00:38:57.443
you can get anonymous advice;
I was careful to make sure it's

00:38:57.443 --> 00:38:58.570
anonymous.
 

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:02.389
So you can get all -- much of
it is contradictory,

00:39:02.389 --> 00:39:05.233
so your job is to look through
it and try to get some idea of

00:39:05.233 --> 00:39:07.510
what they're telling you that's
worth knowing.

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.005
For Monday there are problems
from that webpage,

00:39:10.005 --> 00:39:11.760
"Pepys &amp;
Newton."

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.275
And let me tell you that you
better get together with other

00:39:15.275 --> 00:39:18.063
people to do it,
because there's a lot of stuff

00:39:18.063 --> 00:39:18.670
there.
 

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:21.940
So get together in a group,
parcel out who works on what,

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.869
discuss what went on and so on.
 

00:39:23.869 --> 00:39:27.570
And then for a week from Friday
there's stuff about drawing

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.315
Lewis Structures,
from another webpage about

00:39:30.315 --> 00:39:31.719
functional groups.
 

00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:35.483
So we'll get to that later,
I just wanted you to know

00:39:35.483 --> 00:39:36.860
what's coming up.
 

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.577
Incidentally,
this thing about the problems

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:43.072
set that has to do with the
mathematics that Newton and

00:39:43.072 --> 00:39:47.760
Pepys were working on there,
has to do with isotope ratios.

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.909
You know, chlorine has a funny
atomic weight.

00:39:51.909 --> 00:39:52.949
Why?
 

00:39:52.949 --> 00:39:55.010
What is the atomic weight,
does anybody know?

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.369
Student:  35.5.
 

00:39:56.369 --> 00:39:57.820
Prof: Thirty-five and a
half.

00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:00.530
Why a half?
 

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:05.309
Most of the elements are pretty
near integers.

00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:08.190
It's because it's a mixture of
isotopes.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:12.929
It's a quarter of one isotope
and three-quarters of the other,

00:40:12.929 --> 00:40:16.349
and the average is thirty-five
and a half;

00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:19.460
thirty-five and thirty-seven.
 

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:24.041
But in fact it depends on where
you get chlorine from,

00:40:24.041 --> 00:40:25.768
what the ratio is.
 

00:40:25.768 --> 00:40:29.494
There's thirty-five and a half
for a standard atomic weight,

00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:33.219
but it ranges quite a bit,
depending on where you get it.

00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:37.788
So by measuring these ratios,
which is a lot like these odds

00:40:37.788 --> 00:40:41.273
in the betting,
you can tell where things came

00:40:41.273 --> 00:40:41.969
from.
 

00:40:41.969 --> 00:40:45.090
You can tell where hydrocarbons
came from sometimes that way.

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:46.650
And those are the problems that
you have to deal with.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:49.969
So it's not really very,
very relevant to the course as

00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:53.596
a whole, but it's relevant to
the Pepys and Newton thing and

00:40:53.596 --> 00:40:55.010
it's a fun problem.
 

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:56.679
So that's what you've got to do
for Monday.

00:40:56.679 --> 00:40:59.780
Okay, and here are the
assignments.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.190
I emailed all these people.
 

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:04.213
I hope you're here,
and that you picked up on what

00:41:04.213 --> 00:41:07.855
we talked about today so that
you can improve the Wikis from

00:41:07.855 --> 00:41:08.719
last year.
 

00:41:08.719 --> 00:41:12.429
Last year people developed
their Wikis from scratch.

00:41:12.429 --> 00:41:16.219
This time -- which is a very
valuable thing to do.

00:41:16.219 --> 00:41:19.992
So I was torn this year as to
whether to have you do them from

00:41:19.992 --> 00:41:22.530
scratch or whether to modify
last year.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:26.130
I figured modifying last year
is better because then you have

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:29.610
something to read earlier on,
for those who are not working

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.869
on developing it.
 

00:41:30.869 --> 00:41:34.429
So anyhow, but the hope is --
so if you modify it --

00:41:34.429 --> 00:41:35.989
it has to be something
significant,

00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:38.260
not put a comma in or something
like that,

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.090
but add something useful to
understanding.

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:45.166
If you do it within thirty-six
hours, you get two points,

00:41:45.166 --> 00:41:49.389
and if what you do is really
good, you get three points.

00:41:49.389 --> 00:41:52.132
So you go to that page and you
click on those things and then

00:41:52.132 --> 00:41:55.059
you can read what -- or you can
either modify them or read it;

00:41:55.059 --> 00:41:56.429
it's a Wiki.
 

00:41:56.429 --> 00:41:58.809
Now, we come to the question
that we'll address more.

00:41:58.809 --> 00:42:01.530
We have another five minutes
here.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.505
The question we're really
dealing with now,

00:42:04.505 --> 00:42:06.702
having seen how to work in
Chem.

00:42:06.702 --> 00:42:09.679
125, is are there atoms and
molecules;

00:42:09.679 --> 00:42:12.869
how do you know?
 

00:42:12.869 --> 00:42:15.949
And what force holds them
together?

00:42:15.949 --> 00:42:20.184
Because if we knew that they're
real, and we knew what force

00:42:20.184 --> 00:42:23.630
held them together,
then in principle we might be

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.000
able to calculate everything.
 

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.570
So it would all be theory.
 

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:36.469
So is it springs that hold
atoms together?

00:42:36.469 --> 00:42:39.550
So Robert Boyle -- notice he's
right at that time,

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.539
1627 to 1691,
and he's the oldest person

00:42:42.539 --> 00:42:46.679
that's on the Honor Roll outside
the building here,

00:42:46.679 --> 00:42:52.965
he's over that way -- so Robert
Boyle wrote this first important

00:42:52.965 --> 00:42:56.655
book in chemistry,
New Experiments

00:42:56.655 --> 00:43:00.914
Physico-Mechanical:
Touching the Spring of

00:43:00.914 --> 00:43:01.889
Air.
 

00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:06.612
So you know Boyle's Law,
how pressure and volume change,

00:43:06.612 --> 00:43:10.219
that air in a piston acts like
a spring.

00:43:10.219 --> 00:43:15.139
So PV is a constant;
that's Boyle's Law.

00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:20.041
So he developed this science on
the basis of a new instrument,

00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:23.898
the pneumatical engine,
which was built by Robert

00:43:23.898 --> 00:43:26.230
Hooke, the guy we quoted.
 

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:31.161
And there's a picture of the
air pump here with that crank on

00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:35.599
it, and so on to pump things in
or out of that bulb.

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:39.860
Now a couple of years later
Hooke wrote this book,

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.990
Lectures,
De Potentia Restitutiva,

00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:46.469
or of Spring,
explaining the power of

00:43:46.469 --> 00:43:48.469
springing bodies.
 

00:43:48.469 --> 00:43:50.409
And this is the beginning of
that book.

00:43:50.409 --> 00:43:54.451
"The Theory of Springs,
though attempted by divers

00:43:54.451 --> 00:43:58.568
eminent Mathematicians of this
Age has hitherto not been

00:43:58.568 --> 00:44:00.139
Published by any.
 

00:44:00.139 --> 00:44:03.710
It is now about eighteen years
since I first found it out,

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:08.369
but designing to apply it to
some particular use,

00:44:08.369 --> 00:44:11.550
I omitted the publishing
thereof."

00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:14.659
So he kept it secret so no one
would steal the idea.

00:44:14.659 --> 00:44:21.043
What did he hope to do with a
spring, a really important

00:44:21.043 --> 00:44:26.150
technology that he could do with
a spring?

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:30.090
There was a coil in the spring
that he depended on.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:30.969
Student: Flying.
 

00:44:30.969 --> 00:44:33.518
Student:  Pendulum
clock. 

00:44:33.518 --> 00:44:35.846
Prof: A new kind of
clock, one that could work

00:44:35.846 --> 00:44:36.920
better for navigation.
 

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.246
It was his spring that actually
allowed Harrison,

00:44:40.246 --> 00:44:43.505
100 years later,
to win the contest about making

00:44:43.505 --> 00:44:46.393
an accurate clock;
some of you must know that

00:44:46.393 --> 00:44:46.760
story.
 

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.360
So anyhow he had been hiding
this so it wouldn't be stolen.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.570
In fact, it was stolen by
Huygens.

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:56.885
So "about three years
since His Majesty was pleased to

00:44:56.885 --> 00:44:59.630
see the experiment that made out
this theory,

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:04.989
tried at White Hall,
and also my spring watch.

00:45:04.989 --> 00:45:09.262
About two years since I printed
the theory in an anagram at the

00:45:09.262 --> 00:45:12.570
end of my book on the
description of helioscopes,

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:13.949
viz." this.
 

00:45:13.949 --> 00:45:18.206
So this is what he published at
the end of this book on

00:45:18.206 --> 00:45:23.791
helioscopes,
and that is an anagram of how

00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:27.402
springs work,
so that later he could prove

00:45:27.402 --> 00:45:29.318
that he knew it,
if needs be,

00:45:29.318 --> 00:45:33.110
but no one could steal it in
the meantime.

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:36.757
And if you unscramble it,
it's "Ut tensio sic

00:45:36.757 --> 00:45:39.396
vis;
that is, the power of any

00:45:39.396 --> 00:45:43.969
spring is in the same proportion
with the tension thereof.

00:45:43.969 --> 00:45:47.806
That is, if one power stretch
or bend at one space,

00:45:47.806 --> 00:45:51.490
two will stress at two,
three will bend at three,

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.409
and so forward."
 

00:45:53.409 --> 00:45:54.750
So here's his figure that shows
that.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.960
That's Hooke's Law,
the force law.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.659
The force is proportional to
the distortion.

00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:04.510
So here's his figure,
and he's got plots of it here.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:09.166
Ut tensio (as the
extension) sic vis (so

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:10.309
the force).
 

00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:14.603
So it's linear,
the force is how much you

00:46:14.603 --> 00:46:16.000
stretch it.
 

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.880
And he has lots of different
kinds of springs that do that.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.005
Here's this clock kind of
spring, a coil spring,

00:46:22.005 --> 00:46:23.670
just stretching a wire.
 

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.409
So the force is proportional to
the extension.

00:46:26.409 --> 00:46:29.735
Or another way of saying it is,
"The potential energy is

00:46:29.735 --> 00:46:32.619
proportional to the square of
the extension."

00:46:32.619 --> 00:46:34.429
So it's a parabola.
 

00:46:34.429 --> 00:46:38.824
So that's Hooke's Law,
and that's where we'll take up

00:46:38.824 --> 00:46:39.840
next time.
